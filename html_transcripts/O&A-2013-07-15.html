<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Greg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton discussing their illnesses.  They then launched into a heated discussion of the George Zimmerman verdict in the Trayvon Martin case, covering the trial's perceived flaws, the prosecution's shortcomings, and the wildly divergent public reaction, particularly the intense and divisive commentary on Twitter. A caller, Corey, described contrasting post-verdict reactions in Los Angeles (chaotic) and Times Square (peaceful).  Kim Kardashian's tweeted shock at the verdict was also mentioned.  Anthony recounted a night out with Greg Gutfeld, Ann Coulter, and Judge Alex, humorously detailing Ann Coulter's loss of a scarf (which Cumia now possesses).  A lawyer then called in to debate Jim Norton about the case.  The segment concluded with the surprise appearance of Robert Zimmerman, George Zimmerman's brother, in the studio. Robert discussed the trial, his inability to watch the testimony, and his reaction to the verdict.

The interview with Robert Zimmerman continued, focusing on the jury's deliberations (including their questions about manslaughter instructions), the intense media coverage, and the public's reaction.  He defended his brother's claim of self-defense, criticizing the media's portrayal of the shooting as racially motivated, blaming figures like Benjamin Crump and Natalie Jackson for manipulating the narrative. He detailed the intense scrutiny and threats faced by his family and their attempts to remain anonymous. He discussed George Zimmerman's emotional state, future legal options (including suing NBC), and criticized media personalities like Nancy Grace and Jenny Hutt.  He also addressed the controversial opening joke by George Zimmerman's lawyer, Don West.  Jenny Hutt herself called in, leading to further debate about the prosecution's case and the media's role.  The conversation frequently employed offensive language.

The conversation with Robert Zimmerman continued, focusing on the trial's outcome, the media's portrayal, and accusations of racism.  He detailed the family’s experience in hiding and ongoing harassment, as well as the effect the case had on his own career. Judge Alex called in, offering a legal perspective, criticizing the prosecution and media coverage, speculating on the prosecutor's motivations and potential ethical violations.  The hosts and Robert discussed instances of allegedly biased reporting and the role of celebrities in shaping public opinion, mentioning Nancy Grace repeatedly. The segment then unexpectedly shifted to a discussion of creepy childhood experiences, horror movies (specifically *Insidious*), and a hypothetical Bigfoot sighting, before briefly returning to the difficulties of navigating public perception under intense scrutiny.

The show shifted to a discussion of a cold, followed by a reaction to a preview of "The Conjuring," which elicited strong fear and expletives from the hosts.  They then planned a group screening for the show's staff, navigating scheduling conflicts and construction issues.  A significant portion of the segment was dedicated to a phone interview with actor Tom Skerritt, during which the hosts enthusiastically discussed his career, current projects (including work with PTSD veterans), and even the perceived homoeroticism in "Top Gun."  Following the interview, they mocked a news hoax involving fabricated names for Asiana Airlines pilots, using crude language to express their amusement and disdain.  The segment ended with a brief discussion of the George Zimmerman verdict and a short comedic bit related to the trial.  Sam Roberts hosted the post-show segment, discussing listener calls and social media reactions.

The final segment opened with a discussion of the George Zimmerman verdict, where the hosts stated that while he may not be legally guilty, they believed he was morally responsible for Trayvon Martin’s death.  Sam Roberts, a broadcaster and wrestling expert, joined in studio, discussing his upcoming appearance at the Gathering of the Juggalos and Juggalo Championship Wrestling commentary. He mentioned his own show, featuring guests like Colin Quinn and Jason Biggs.  The conversation shifted to "Orange is the New Black," focusing on its depiction of female prison life, nudity, and overall appeal.  A caller, "Petey Bricks," a retired Texas prison warden, provided graphic details of life in both male and female Texas prisons, including sexual activity between guards and inmates, violence, and gang dynamics.  He described a riot and his injuries.  The conversation returned to "Orange is the New Black," with speculation on how the hosts and others would fare in prison.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the show and a plug for Sam Roberts' YouTube channel.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  And sane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning, everybody.  Hello.  Going to show a lot of energy because we got a sick show, right?  Yeah, everybody's like a little sick.  We call it under the weather.  Who gets sick in the summer, by the way? 
[00:01:30]  I don't know.  Some kind of a germ got in there.  Well, I took a Friday off to enjoy a beach house.  I ended up having my famous strep throat, which I get once a year.  Was it strep?  Oh, yeah.  It was strep.  Why?  Just wondering.  Yeah, absolutely was.  Worst fucking sore throat I've had in years.  I'll tell you that.  That Z-Pak, when you use it properly.  Yeah.  Good shit.  A lot of people get those Z-Paks and eat it like it's fucking M&Ms. 
[00:02:00]  But when you use it properly, oh, my God, does it work.  Knocked that shit right out of me.  Yeah, that sore throat thing going on over the weekend.  Right.  Late last week and then over the weekend.  And then it went away.  And then all of a sudden just, bam, full-blown AIDS in my fucking face.  Everyone seems to have it, though.  Yeah.  Fucking cold.  I think I brought it home from Philly because we were at a kid party down there.  And my sister-in-law had strep throat.  And she showed up at the kid's party and said, oh, no, I'm good now. 
[00:02:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And a lot of us have been sick ever since with something.  So I think I got it from her probably.  Who knows?  It sucks.  Like hacking, coughing.  And then the dry tickle cough.  Yeah.  And then just the nose.  Snot.  How the hell does a body produce that much of it?  It's crazy.  I know.  And then you get dehydrated because of that. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, man.  Well, I got some of this vitamin fucking C, thousand milligrams, super orange.  Does this shit work?  Any of this stuff works?  I have no idea.  Usually just take some Robitussin and ride it out.  Well, everyone has their solution.  You got to do coldies.  You got to fucking get a shot of fucking B12.  You got to hit yourself up with a big dose of vitamin C.  I don't know if any of this stuff works.  You got to just try to stay healthy and make sure people don't cough on you. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And you can't even, you know, the thing with a cold thing like that, you can't.  There's no way to completely cut yourself off from it.  Right.  You're touching shit.  You're touching face.  People around you.  Shaking hands.  Shake hands.  Shaking hands.  A lot of shaking of hands.  Doing big backdoor deals.  Right.  People don't really shake hands anymore.  Backdoor deals.  Who shakes hands?  I don't know.  That's like a lost art.  I'm a handshaker.  No, you're not.  I see a lot of guys that shake hands. 
[00:04:00]  I do.  No, you don't.  It's a quick little fist bump.  No, I never fist bump.  Or a deep fucking kiss.  A nice deep tongue kiss.  It's either a deep kiss or a fist bump.  But that handshaking is God.  Man.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus H. Christ.  So I guess nothing really happened since the last radio show.  No, no.  Very slow news weekend, apparently. 
[00:04:30]  Not much to talk about on Twitter or anything.  It's just a...  Oh, yeah.  Twitter.  That thing.  The Twitter.  Oh, yeah.  That thing.  It's just...  What a lovely place to hang out.  Twitter has just permeated our lives.  It's permeated everyone's lives, and it's really just becoming a very, very sad thing.  There's so much negativity associated with Twitter.  You know?  When the Twitter guys came around, it was like, 
[00:05:00]  holy fuck, this is it.  This is how we're going to communicate with each other.  140 characters.  We'll just talk.  And the more and more, you know, we get into it,  it's just a negative, shitty world.  A lot of negative Nellies.  With everyone just writing their shit on a bathroom wall, like you said.  It's the bathroom wall, it's the desk in school, it's the fucking, you know, just whatever  it is, wherever you can write some shit about somebody.  And everyone has a problem with it.  Everyone you talk to has a problem with it. 
[00:05:30]  It's too bad.  But there we are.  It could be such a great thing.  But there we are every day.  And then you just realize, like, there are a lot of just shitty people out there.  Yeah.  Yeah, there are.  We've been in the public eye for a really long time,  so I always felt like we were, you know, hopefully more aware than the average person  because we get to see a lot of different things.  Man, Twitter has just opened my eyes, and I realize there's just a lot of shitty people.  Just shitty fucking people. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You got to definitely take it for what it is.  Yeah.  You think it'll turn into anything else?  No.  No?  No.  People, I think people have over, a lot of great expectations for humanity.  And the truth of the matter is, it's the people.  You know, it's not Twitter.  Right.  It's not the fucking program.  It's the people typing shit into it.  And people are just awful things.  Well, it leads to the Zimmerman verdict. 
[00:06:30]  I mean, there was a verdict.  When that happens, I'm interested to see what happens.  Yeah.  Fuck up.  I ran.  It does, it goes to your point, though.  I mean, it was pretty obvious that they just didn't prove their case against Zimmerman.  Yeah.  And people just are, can't believe it.  They're just in shock, and they're outraged, and they just, they want justice for Trayvon.  The fact is, they didn't prove their case.  They didn't, they didn't have a case.  It wasn't even that they didn't prove their case.  They did a good job. 
[00:07:00]  They were good prosecutors.  Right.  There was just no case.  There's a difference between not proving a case and there not being a case.  There just wasn't a case.  And these people, I don't know, they, I don't know, they, they, they're just, uh, yeah,  they're just amazed that it went down this way.  I, the, the division on Twitter and, uh, on, in public, on the streets and stuff last  night and whatnot, um, just an amazing division.  And that divisiveness, uh, is put there a lot by these leaders, pseudo-leaders, that the 
[00:07:30]  media, like I said, is completely fucking culpable in, in, in this, for being dishonest, for putting  news out there that is based on what they need to get viewers and keep viewers and, and  nothing to do with the actual facts.  Uh, I, I chose not to celebrate the verdict.  A lot of people wanted to celebrate the verdict.  I celebrated in a way, not like, uh, woo-hoo, gloating, celebrating, but I celebrated it as,  uh, uh, you look at the case, you look at what, what the facts were. 
[00:08:00]  And, um, I'm glad that, that it worked.  The system worked, the, the politics and emotion were taken out of it, and, uh, facts were put  in, and, um, I'm glad it worked out the way it did.  I'm not glad that a kid's dead, no, I'm not a fucking animal, but, uh, I'm glad the system  worked out.  Yeah, I just feel, like, an overall sadness.  It's a bad thing. 
[00:08:30]  It's just the whole thing is just kind of sad.  You gotta be crazy to deny that it's not a, um, a terrible, uh, thing that happened.  Thank you, Jackie.  Look how she puts it right perfect.  It's just amazing.  It's just amazing every time, Sam.  She's amazing.  It's not amazing.  Oh, and then she just turns on before she leaves.  Other interns, they put the coffee way over there, or, look, look, look.  You're in the middle of something.  Cheers.  She's a doll.  Look.  She does nothing terribly impressive.  What?  Nothing.  Perfect placement. 
[00:09:00]  It's right of your mind, Sam.  Right within arm's reach.  Look.  Oh.  Look at this.  Couldn't be a more average interest.  Oh, Sam.  Sounds like the old green-eyed monster's out.  I don't even get coffee.  What?  Green-eyed.  I don't even get coffee.  But to have so many people in America shocked.  That got me.  I follow the case more than people realize.  Yeah.  I mean, it was your thing, but I absolutely followed it, and, uh, it was very, uh, obvious  that, you know, they weren't gonna get them on anything.  I mean, I think, I think they blew it by not going for lesser charges. 
[00:09:30]  I think you had some cocky people down there in Florida.  They went for the lesser manslaughter charge.  No, I understand that, but they should have, like, threw something else on the table.  They would have got that.  I don't think they would have.  They would have got something.  I don't think they would have.  What would have been the next charge they could have got?  Involuntary manslaughter.  Involuntary.  Um, but it wasn't involuntary manslaughter.  But manslaughter and second-degree manslaughter, I'm like, there's no fucking way they're gonna  get this.  Everything they could have come up with was protected under the justification law. 
[00:10:00]  He was justified in doing what he did, so it throws out whatever, whatever crime there  was.  That's why, you know, and I'm not, I told you to, I just knew from the start, like, right  when I started getting the info on this trial, it's like, as long as you don't get that weird  jury thing, as long as the jury looks at the facts like they were supposed to, and rendered  a decision on that, and not emotion and sympathy and everything else, they're told not to render 
[00:10:30]  a decision on, it couldn't have gone another way.  Women, uh, women get things done, man.  They really don't.  Six women on the jury.  They get things done.  Six women.  They really do, man.  And you gotta realize, they're in this little fucking microcosm of a world when they're  sequestered like that, and their whole life is that trial at that moment, and they know  it's very important for them to get it right, and when they're charged by the judge, the 
[00:11:00]  instructions, and they're told, don't base this on emotion, I know you've seen a lot of  things that are very sad, and you can't base this on sympathy, you can't draw conclusions  that are out of the realm of the fact.  All that stuff, they're told that.  They don't then just go back there and forget it.  Right.  You know, and it becomes such an important thing.  And you know, you know, women, especially their wives and mothers and stuff.  They're very, um, very calculated.  They're very good with systematic things and figuring things out, and that's what they 
[00:11:30]  were, the task they were put to.  Imagine what's going on through their minds today.  I would think they could now look at other facts that they weren't allowed to look at  during the trial, and feel that they did render the right decision.  I don't think it's one of those trials where the jury then looks at other things that weren't  admitted because of some reason or another, and then goes, oh my god, what did we do?  This is terrible. 
[00:12:00]  If we were told this, we would have said that.  But I think they'll be happy with their decision, you know?  I think that they did the right thing legally, but I don't think, I didn't want to see him  walk completely.  I didn't want to see him go for 25 years, but I wanted to see him go for something.  Because I think he was a part of it.  But that wasn't on the table.  No, I know.  That was the problem.  It's almost the exact opposite of the way I felt.  You should have at least gave him a parking ticket or something.  Jesus.  Like with OJ, I thought that they legally did the right thing.  Right.  But morally, he should have went to jail. 
[00:12:30]  I think that the prosecutor just fucking had a terrible job in the OJ case.  In this case, I think they legally did the right thing.  But morally, I mean, I said it the opposite.  Whatever.  I know what I'm trying to say.  I just think that they did the wrong thing morally.  And once again, Kim Kardashian tweeted she was just so shocked.  Jesus, you fucking...  You idiot.  You shut your mouth.  Do you know who your father is?  Stop being shocked.  Right?  The biggest shocker ever. 
[00:13:00]  The biggest shocker ever your father was involved with.  Yeah.  And she's tweeting how she's just in shock over the verdict.  I don't believe it.  What was the exact tweet?  Oh, my God.  It was amazing.  A lot of people coming out on Twitter yapping about it.  I was flipping around the news channels.  And, wow, there is such...  I'm not going to say anything then.  People don't know already.  There's such a divide out there in America. 
[00:13:30]  You go on MSNBC.  They said...  They just said, fuck it.  And had...  It was...  It was a Trayvon tribute show.  It was completely a bunch of black people.  Right.  I didn't see one white person all weekend.  No.  And then you go over to Fox.  It was the complete opposite.  Yeah, yeah.  And then CNN was sort of wishy-washy in the middle.  Sort of.  Sort of.  But still pushing toward more black hosts than not.  They had...  MSNBC had the... 
[00:14:00]  The...  Piano music.  Right.  You know?  And when they'd go into commercial break, they'd slowly put the camera over on a big picture  of Trayvon with, like, a quote from a black civil rights leader under it.  I'm watching going, what the fuck is this?  It's a tribute show.  And then Fox had...  Zippity-doo-dah!  Zippity-day!  Fox is covering other stories.  They didn't care.  Did they really cover a lot of other stories?  Yeah, they went to other things.  It was, you know...  Yeah.  I, again, don't think Fox was as the other way as MSNBC was the other way. 
[00:14:30]  Well, you drink with those people, so, you know, we gotta take what you say with a grain  of salt on that one, sir.  I, I'm an observer.  I saw the pictures.  Now you're drinking with the...  Well, I've been drinking with them for a while.  It was, uh, yeah.  Um, Greg Gutfeld and, um, Ann Coulter and, uh...  Judge Alex.  Judge Alex.  Can he put them back?  We all went out.  He's a responsible drinker.  He is.  He wasn't...  Pounding? 
[00:15:00]  Pounding.  Mm-hmm.  But, uh, it was a nice night out.  I imagine, uh...  A lot of fun at the table.  Ann Coulter can throw some back with the boys.  Ann Lay, yeah.  She can, she can put a couple down.  She can put a couple down.  I like it.  Did she lose a scarf or something?  Yeah, she lost the scarf.  And who's got the scarf?  I have Ann Coulter's scarf.  It's glad that you have such a close relationship.  She just contacts you on Twitter.  I know.  She's not emailing.  You still don't have fucking...  No, we...  Each other's numbers.  We traded some emails.  I think she wanted to get to me, like, really quickly, um, to see if I had it. 
[00:15:30]  And I was still there.  So I could grab it.  Yeah, you never want to call somebody in that situation.  No, you don't want to call anybody.  I didn't want a public forum.  Right.  Right.  Hey, where's my scarf?  Right.  Did you rub it around your dick?  No, I didn't rub it around my dick.  What's wrong with you?  You're not a fucking man.  That's right.  You got a lady's scarf.  You rub that shit around your dick.  Is that what you do?  Yep.  I didn't even know that.  Especially if it's a soft scarf.  Oh, man.  What was the material?  It depends.  Silk.  Yeah, you rub that around your dick.  A silk scarf? 
[00:16:00]  Sam, you would, right?  Yeah, you got to put it on your dick.  It's Hermes.  You have to.  You really do.  It's like, um, sex by proxy kind of a thing?  Well, you don't...  Just don't dribble on it.  You know what I mean?  But you definitely rub it.  You rub it a little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  And there was a, um, there was a doctor there from Sloan Kettering Cancer.  I think he was at some big cancer doctor.  Jesus, what a was, Phil.  And then a soap star guy.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But, uh, and, and, like, we were talking to the soap guy.  It's like, how do you learn that many lines? 
[00:16:30]  And, God, it's amazing how you guys can learn so many lines.  And then I'm looking on, yeah, we're amazed by this guy.  This guy cures cancer.  Yeah.  Right.  And we're fawning over that.  The soap opera guy.  The soap guy can memorize some wacky words.  And then you close it.  Yeah.  It was a very fun night, though, yeah.  I got jury duty next Monday.  I hope I don't get a fucking...  Oh, man.  I hope I don't get a Zimmerman case. 
[00:17:00]  Jesus.  Yeah, that jury, um...  I finally have to go to jury duty.  You finally got to do it?  Our favors ran out.  That's it?  Yep.  I thought, man, that was a quick five years.  Yeah, I got to go.  Yeah.  Just quote some of the tweets that came in last night.  They'll kick you right off that jury.  No kidding.  That's why.  The fucking people are just horrible.  Then why would they kick off the jury?  Racist tweets.  You know, if you just quote some of those things.  Jury duty.  Ugh.  God. 
[00:17:30]  You won't get...  Who does that anymore?  You'll get some stupid fucking case.  You won't get a shit.  Oh, God.  Now I'm in a bad mood.  I thought...  Did you just get out of it?  It seems like it.  Must have been, what, two years?  No.  Three years?  Five years?  I think it might have been five years.  I remember someone saying, you're good for five years.  I kind of knew people at the time.  But now, like, they're shutting down those favors.  Damn.  Because everyone's taking a look.  Do you see this fucking pitch? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, is that Carly...  Carly Ray...  Jepson.  Cyrus Jefferson or something like that.  Carly Ray Bieber Jefferson.  Sam Broca, that artist.  Yeah.  What happened to that?  She was not...  She was just fucking...  She's 35 years old, Sam.  I know.  Making believe she's 17 or 18.  She really is making believe she's a kid.  They had a...  Deadspins got the pitch.  I'm sure we'll put it on our Facebook page.  But they had a montage of the worst...  That's so funny.  The worst first pitches over the years? 
[00:18:30]  Baba Booey make it?  Uh, no.  Because he's got a horrible pitch.  The best one ever was the Cincinnati...  I think it was the mayor of Cincinnati.  Oh, yeah.  Did you see this?  That was a good one.  Did you see the montage?  No, I haven't seen the montage.  I remember the mayor, though.  With stupid Obama, because everyone thinks Obama's an athlete.  I've been yelling this for years.  He's a nerd that isn't an athlete.  A nerd.  He brags about his basketball skills, and he sucks.  He's horrendous.  And he can't throw a baseball.  Do you remember his pitch?  Yeah, it was terrible. 
[00:19:00]  It was high and way outside to the left.  And did you see the Carl Lewis pitch?  This montage is going around.  I'm not sure what news channel showed it.  Carl Lewis threw it two feet.  Really?  Have you ever seen the Carl Lewis first pitch?  No.  A dinosaur throwing out the first pitch?  Chip likes this one.  Lock, yeah.  Oh. 
[00:19:30]  That thing's creepy looking.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Twitter co-founder.  Oh, my God.  That wasn't that.  Here's Carl Lewis.  Watch this.  We should put this on our Facebook page.  He's trying to get the roof raised.  Watch this.  Oh, my God.  It stinks.  And then he looks at his hand like, yeah, it must have been something.  Right.  George Steinberg and his wife.  Oh, God.  Why didn't people keep the ball in their hands too long?  That was a great pitch. 
[00:20:00]  Some guy in San Diego.  It's just terrible pitch.  Oh, my God.  People hold it too long and throw it right by their feet.  How hard is this?  How hard is it, really?  Bob-a-boy makes this fucking thing.  It's terrible.  Some cameraman caught it.  Oh, the ump caught it.  How could it be that bad to throw in a baseball?  Watch this fucking thing.  Oh, my God. 
[00:20:30]  He threw it literally left.  It just went left.  It had to be 30 feet to the left.  What Mark Schott said about him was really inappropriate.  Who's the number one worst?  Oh, Mariah Carey.  Mariah Carey.  All right.  Oh, God.  She's all gussied up.  Oh.  That wasn't the worst, though.  I think Chris Rock has a really bad one somewhere, but it's impossible to find. 
[00:21:00]  Really?  He paid off some people?  I think so.  There's riots in L.A. right now?  No.  Corey wants to talk about it in Vegas.  Corey.  Yes.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  I just got in not too long ago, and it was rioting out here.  It was so-called rioting.  There were dozens and dozens of uninformed black people.  And just to make a little case, I am behind Anthony, 100%.  When he came to this, he turned me as a black guy. 
[00:21:30]  And he was out there throwing trash cans, stopping traffic.  It's not rioting.  There's a little shenanigans going on, but no rioting.  You look at L.A. back in 92, that's some rioting.  Well, they ran on the freeway.  The police had to stop them.  They ran on the freeway, which was pretty funny today.  I tried to get rid of that.  And then they tried to move up to Hollywood, and L.A.P.D. was having none of that.  And I tried to take a couple pictures of it, but they was having none of that. 
[00:22:00]  They was trying to push them all back to Leimert Park.  And then they kind of put them up in threes, and it was like, you three go.  And they were just stopping everybody.  The press couldn't take pictures.  They were like, no, we're not having none of that.  It was funny, because they're trying to stand for something.  But all the older people lost havoc, and they just let the younger, like, 19-year-old people.  And for a minute, they started chanting, no justice, no peace.  They started chanting, no peace, no justice, for a while.  And I'm just sitting there looking like, oh, these idiots. 
[00:22:30]  I think the police departments around some of the larger cities have gotten so good at crowd control, more so than they used to.  And I think their deployment is a lot quicker these days,  that I don't see the giant riots really easily being able to happen like they used to.  They're able to divvy up a crowd, break up that crowd.  If you have a big gathering, and you let them just go as a wild mob down the street, 
[00:23:00]  that's what really gets out of hand.  They're able to chop that crowd up into sections, and then each little squad takes a section.  And they can't build that momentum up anymore.  Police have gotten very good at that.  It was pretty impressive in Times Square last night.  Yeah, there were a lot of people.  There were thousands of people in Times Square last night.  Times Square was peaceful.  They had some arrests and shit.  But you're always going to get that with a big crowd.  But there wasn't any mass running around, busting windows, stealing shit or anything. 
[00:23:30]  Sure.  I think the protests...  I think they arrested 17 people in Hollywood today.  It's nothing.  They tried to do something.  They had about, I want to say about 40, maybe 50 cops there.  They just shut it down a little fast.  Yeah, they shut it right down.  All right.  A bunch of people from L.A. tweeting right now saying not much of a riot going on.  No, there's nothing going on.  All right, Corey.  Thank you, brother. 
[00:24:00]  Yes, Corey.  All right.  I think one of the problems that they keep comparing them to Emmett Till is that they  feel like, oh, here's a black guy that was shot and no one's going to jail for it.  Right.  Like, that's what the whole thing is.  Yeah.  Because, like, they say one of the black guys shooting each other, but those guys were arrested.  Like, the guys that shoot each other in Chicago or whatever, or at least seen as criminals  and arrested.  And this is just a case of, like, when you look at, like, Sean...  What is it?  Sean Bell.  And Amadou Diallo. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  I understand this guy would be very frustrating to see these guys fucking getting shot unarmed  and then no one goes to jail for it.  But, yeah, it's all about intent, too, and I don't know.  You don't hear many cases.  I'm sure it happens in reverse.  Yeah.  With black authority figures shooting white people and not suffering any legal penalty.  Like, we get annoyed, and I know I do, and I know you do, is the way the press covers  it.  Like, that's enraging.  Yeah, yeah, totally.  But I don't have too much of an anger over the way the legal system handles most of these. 
[00:25:00]  Like, the fucking four Marines that raped that woman and killed her husband and her.  Oh, yeah.  The legal system handled them.  Or all these other situations.  I don't have too much of an issue with the legal system.  It's just the press.  Yeah, the press.  Whereas with blacks, it seems to be just the opposite.  I don't give a fuck how the press covers it.  Their problems with the way the legal system's handling it.  Yeah, but, you know, the big cry was, you know, no justice, no peace.  Justice for Trayvon.  What is more just in this country than a fair trial with an impartial jury? 
[00:25:30]  Now, they'll say, oh, impartial jury, really?  Yes.  You've got six women in there, regardless of their color.  I mean, I think if you would have put, and this is my opinion, I think if you would have had six black women on that jury, they would have let emotion rule the day more than fact, which would have been a miscarriage of justice.  I think the white women were more apt to not get so emotionally connected to this case, where they were able to let the facts speak for themselves and come up with the acquittal. 
[00:26:00]  I think if they had a full six black women on the jury, there would have been too much emotion, and that would have been a miscarriage of justice.  I think you're probably right, but I still, I'm not, I don't hate George Zimmerman, I just, I'm not thrilled that he walked completely.  Didn't they have a black woman on the jury?  No, she was Spanish, I think.  They hinted that she was black. 
[00:26:30]  I think she was black Hispanic.  Black Hispanic.  As opposed to white Hispanic.  Oh, right.  Tall Hispanic.  Tall Hispanic.  Short Hispanic.  We've got George's brother coming in today.  Yes.  What time?  We don't know.  Robert.  He's running late.  I know he was supposed to be here, but he's running late.  Robert's coming in.  He was great, man.  He was doing all the news channels.  He loves being on TV, man.  He's doing a lot.  He's good at it, man.  He can talk, and he keeps control.  He just, you know, speaks his piece, and they try to rile him up on CNN. 
[00:27:00]  Man, they were, they were just getting ridiculous at one point.  What were they saying?  And he was just covering it.  What were they saying?  Insinuating that his brother was lying.  I, I, I, then you've, I mean, I've, I felt he was about a couple of things, uh, not about  being beaten up.  I, I do believe Trayvon was beating him up, but I do think he bullshitted about a couple  of things.  And maybe Judge Alex was right to say, it was a, just to make yourself look better, you  know, when you know what you have to say. 
[00:27:30]  And maybe that was what it was.  Maybe.  And maybe they weren't case deciding things.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's it.  A lot of people were under the misconception that everything the prosecution was bringing  up was relevant to the, the outcome of the case.  And it just wasn't that getting at when the, when the prosecution gave their closing statement  and, uh, guy said, uh, it's not about stand your ground.  It's about staying in the vehicle. 
[00:28:00]  No, it had, it couldn't have been further from anything.  It's staying in the vehicle.  What does that even mean?  It, it's not, there's nothing wrong with him having left that truck, not one thing wrong  with him having left that truck legally.  You're right.  Legally.  And at the moment in hindsight, knowing that if he left that truck, he'd have to kill someone.  Do you think he'd stay in the truck?  I think he'd stay in the truck at that moment. 
[00:28:30]  But you got to look at this without the hindsight of knowing how this ended.  He's a guy, he's on the phone with the non-emergency 911.  He's told, Hey, all right, keep an eye on him.  Let us know what he does.  He, Drayvon runs out of view.  He's like, I want to see where this guy's going and gets out of the truck and looks.  Now, if nothing more happened, that's the most unexciting fucking thing that could have happened. 
[00:29:00]  We'd never, ever hear about it.  It would have been a non-event.  Since the shooting happened, now you look back at everything that had happened before the shooting,  and it looks ominous, and it looks, oh my God.  The truth of the matter was, and what the jury believed, and what the defense said,  and what the prosecution couldn't refute, was the fact that he got out of that truck  to do nothing more than watch where someone that he had called the police on was going.  That's it.  I agree, except for the fact, and this is what bothers me, that he bullshitted about a few facts. 
[00:29:30]  And I really think that he did bullshit about a few facts.  I don't believe a couple parts of his story, although I believe the part about him.  You know, it's like, there's something about it that bothers me so much.  And when you look at, again, Fat Nick, I was 100% behind Fat Nick.  And he profiled, and he beat the shit out of a guy with a fucking bat.  And I was 100% on Fat Nick's side.  This is not about, oh, I think racial profiling is true. 
[00:30:00]  No, this is something about this case, because this guy was not doing anything wrong,  that will always fucking bother me.  Because the prosecutor said something that really, he was walking home,  and he was minding his own fucking business.  And I understand how it's going to happen.  Right up until he punched him in the face.  I know that.  But we know that that did not have to happen.  And it just bothers me that fucking, something about this one really bugs me.  And that's, it's the fact that he pushed that scenario. 
[00:30:30]  And I know, legally, you're allowed to do it.  I get that.  But think of a guy who comes up and is staring at your chick at a bar.  Yeah.  Like, and he's like, hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Like, you know what he's fucking, and I know legally.  No, no, I know, I'm not even talking legally now.  Now I'm just talking figuratively, whatever.  Who, who came up with this scenario where he did that?  The, he, he walked one way, walked the other.  Where Trevon had plenty of time to go home.  Trevon chose to not go home. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  To confront the man that he said was following him.  There's no indication that it went any other way than that.  So why is it that George Zimmerman is now known as the guy that hunted down this innocent boy who wasn't doing anything?  They never mention now on the news when you watch it, the fact that he punched Zimmerman in the face.  Yeah.  They never even talk about it.  It's just, he was trying to get home with his Skittles and he was gunned down.  Nothing anymore. 
[00:31:30]  Now that the trial's over, nothing about him beating this man about the head.  Yeah.  And, and, and, and you could speculate as to what Trevon and, and George's, uh, meeting was and, and what happened in that short period of time.  But the fact is, if Trevon kept walking, he'd have been home as was George walking back to his truck.  He did not make that turn to try to get down that sidewalk, to, to follow Trevon to his house. 
[00:32:00]  Trevon would have been in his house.  Right.  Would have been in his house.  And you got, you got to remember that Zimmerman's life is pretty much ruined too.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So he got something out of this in the end.  And he's not done with court either.  He has no, they may have a civil trial.  There's no way a civil trial even gets started on him.  It can't.  It cannot.  Oh, because he was found not guilty.  He was found not guilty.  No, no.  So is OJ.  No, no.  He, he can, that, that his civil rights were taken away.  That's what they did. 
[00:32:30]  Civil trial.  Oh, civil, uh, civil.  They could do that, a wrongful death, but the, they're probably, they're probably going  to do it just because of the pressure in America right now.  Yeah, the burden of proof is a lot less on a civil case.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  But it was so slam dunk, they'd have a hard time.  But again, yeah, you could sue anybody.  And what happens to George Zimmerman now?  We got to ask his brother that.  Because what the fuck, what could he do with your life at this point?  Yeah.  I think he wants to like go to law school, become some kind of lawyer. 
[00:33:00]  It would help if we, you know, again, I know you don't get to talk to defendants a  lot, but just looking at his fucking face, it would help if you, sometimes if you, if  you sit down with somebody and you talk to them and you hear them explain themselves and  you, it, I just, I don't know, man.  I wish he would have testified.  I understand why he didn't do the right move.  I understand the strategy by his legal team, but I think that would have been, uh, something  a lot of people would have liked to have seen.  I didn't see anything during that police walkthrough tape or the interview with, um, Hannity  that looked to me like there was some hidden secret bad guy behind the soft spoken, mild 
[00:33:30]  mannered guy that he seems to be.  I don't see the secretive.  Then he sure went on the stand.  No, because the prosecution just knows how to fucking tweet.  You saw what they did with certain testimony.  They could twist it around and turn it into something it never was intended to be.  Uh, it would have just confused the issue.  Unfortunately, defendants that are innocent can't just get up there and testify because  of the way lawyers can handle someone's testimony. 
[00:34:00]  It's amazing.  I would have had to testify if I was a similar man.  It turned out to be the right move too.  Like I, I wanted to see him too, but it turned out to be the smart move.  Let me, um, let me go to Justin in Tampa.  Justin.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, I, I completely agree with Jimmy in the two points that legally, yeah, he probably  wasn't responsible, but I think the guy was really hateable.  And the reason he was is, you know, Anthony just said, Hey, if he could, if he knew he 
[00:34:30]  was going to get out of the truck and kill a guy, he wouldn't have gotten out of the  truck.  But in the Hannity interview, Hannity asked him that if you could go over and do anything  over again, would you?  And his response was no, because it was God's plan.  Well, he, cause he, cause he was talking about the whole linear thing of it, not just taking  a piece, not in hindsight.  He said, if he could change anything, would he, uh, what he was talking about was everything.  You can't just say, Oh, I wouldn't have gotten out of the truck. 
[00:35:00]  Uh, yeah.  Sure you can.  You absolutely can.  I also think, to be honest.  Yeah.  I would change the one thing of not getting out of the truck.  I think that's also legal stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  Dude, I think that's legal stuff.  I have to, I have to say that's like, it's almost like if he says that in an interview  or if he says the word regret, like, you know, like Robert's not saying regret, there  are certain things that in a legal case may be able to use it against you.  If you say like, I fucking regret something.  You're right.  I get that, but he shouldn't have been on Hannity at all.  Okay.  Maybe not.  No, it was, I think it was perfect.  That's why. 
[00:35:30]  When was the Hannity interview, by the way?  How long ago now?  I think about a year ago.  About a year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And to the people on Twitter that think I'm ignoring the Trayvon attack, no, I'm not.  I know that happened.  I didn't say he should have went to jail for second degree.  I believe that that happened.  I believe that that happened.  I believe he was getting beaten up, but I'm not ignoring that.  I wasn't that married to this either way.  Like, I know I played kind of more devil's advocate arguing with you.  Yeah, yeah.  But literally when I was at the Comedy Cellar talking to the black comics, I totally not 
[00:36:00]  took up Zimmerman's side to the extent you did, but kind of argued that point.  Right.  We got Robert Zimmerman's lawyer on the phone, who's a big fan of the show and loves yelling  out slobo, which I find very strange, but that's all right.  What's up, Chris?  How are you?  Hello.  I see you want to debate Jimmy on this.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, just on a few things.  And I apologize.  I'm listening online, or was listening online for about 20 minutes.  More importantly, is Robert coming this way or what? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's running about 15 minutes late.  I think he's probably in the car right now.  All right.  So he'll probably be there about, he was supposed to be there about 6.45.  I think he was going to be there about 7.15.  But, Jimmy, and Jimmy, I love you.  Thank you, sir.  I hope this, I mean, I truly do.  And so, yeah, this is just a friendly little debate.  But you say you, that you.  Thank you, Jackie. 
[00:37:00]  We have a guest.  We have a guest.  We have a guest.  But it's amazing how the food comes right on time.  Love it.  We're heading toward a break, and the food is right there for us.  Right.  So we don't have to eat on air, because the listeners hate that.  She's just a girl.  She doesn't do anything.  She's terrific, Sam.  Just a girl.  You got blinders on.  Go ahead there, Chris.  Yes, sir.  Hi.  Like, you said that George should have been convicted of something. 
[00:37:30]  I mean, like, could you say what you think he could be?  Honestly, I'll be very honest with you.  I realize I'm speaking more from emotion, because there's something about this that just bothers me a lot.  And a lesser manslaughter, which may not have been, legally, it may not have even been on the table.  And I understand that.  But I'm only talking about, it's just, I don't feel he did nothing wrong.  I'm not debating the law and saying that, legally, like, I understand that. 
[00:38:00]  Sometimes, you know, the law says one thing, but we feel something else.  So I don't say that, Lee, I just wanted to see him get convicted of something, but not second-degree murder.  And not even the harshest manslaughter.  There was just something, I don't think he should have walked, totally.  Okay, I understand.  And, I mean, obviously, I completely disagree.  I understand, yeah.  But one of the reasons you talk about it, that he said something, or he told the police something to the effect, 
[00:38:30]  and I might misquote it a little bit, that tonight you're going to die, or you're going to die tonight.  And now, what if, what if, all right, they didn't, cops didn't take him to the hospital.  I guarantee you, with a broken nose and a head like that, he had a concussion.  I mean, football players get a concussion, and they come, the head coach asks them, hey, what's your name?  And then they'll say, um, Joe Montana.  Right.  You know, so if he had a concussion, what if Trayvon said, you're going to die tonight, motherfucker? 
[00:39:00]  And he said, and when George spoke to the police, he said it, as he did, tonight, you know, tonight's your last night of life, or whatever.  I mean...  Could he have made a mistake?  You're saying he could have made an honest mistake in recalling it in that moment?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  Again, you could be right.  Oh, wow.  That's what you were trying to say.  I just don't...  I just don't...  I just don't buy it. 
[00:39:30]  Chris, are you nervous?  Jesus.  Um, yeah, I can't believe it.  Okay.  I'm just trying to help you out, because you're a lawyer, my God.  Chris, what bothers...  A little nervous.  All right.  Go ahead, Chris.  What bothers me, Chris, is that, again, I don't think George is a stalker.  I don't think he's out to murder a guy.  I don't think he's this terrible fucking inhuman at all.  The bottom line was, I know he had called 911 ten times.  He did profile this guy, and I would have, too, in those circumstances.  Like, I understand why you profile that dude. 
[00:40:00]  I don't say that he's morally...  I can't comprehend how...  Of course I get why.  It's a white neighborhood, a black guy in a hoodie walking through.  You've had some robberies.  You're checking him out.  I get that.  But when you go down that road, and you got a pistol, there's just too many things that,  like, oh, he's circling my car, but I'm getting out anyway.  There's certain inconsistencies that just bothered me, and I think he had the courage  of having the gun, which I probably would have had, too, in that situation, but not  the know-how to stop that situation before it got to that point. 
[00:40:30]  And that, in that kind of intangible, inexplicable thing is what bothers me.  Now, did you see the FBI released a report on Thursday?  Because they interviewed approximately 35 to 40 people down there, and they determined  that there was no racial profiling and no racism at all?  Yes, they did.  I was glad they didn't allow that into the case, but I don't really care what they said.  We all, having a common human experience, understand that Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, 
[00:41:00]  I don't think he profiled him racially because he was a terrible man, because black guys had  been robbing the houses.  Yeah, so who else would you look for?  Of course!  You'd be dumb to profile an old Chinese lady in a hoodie.  Exactly.  So, again, I know what the FBI said, it doesn't matter to me what they said, we all know why  he looked at Trayvon suspiciously, because I would have, or the same reason they would  look at me suspiciously if I was walking through Bedford-Stuyvesant or a black neighborhood, 
[00:41:30]  they would think I was there for drugs or whatever.  You know, come on, we all understand that, regardless of what the FBI said.  Okay, but he also didn't live there.  True.  Um, so it's a gated community, and I don't know, I don't know how many residents there  are, but if it's huge, you know, it might not be that big of a community, and so it's  somebody you don't know, they're walking in the rain, they got their hoodie up, they're 
[00:42:00]  basically they're wearing appropriate rain gear.  Yeah, I mean, basically, but, um, again, at the same time, all the injuries were on George.  Yep.  There was no injuries.  Yeah, all the injuries being on Zimmerman, that was a big thing.  I agree.  Yeah.  I mean, go ahead, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  So, I mean, basically, if I'm following you, all right, you're a celebrity, whatnot.  I like that angle.  That's nice. 
[00:42:30]  I'm an A-lister.  And, you know, I start following you, whether I want an autograph or whatnot, you know, and  I'm following you out of the comedy cellar or whatever, and I'm 10 feet behind you,  and I follow you for 10 blocks, does that give you the right to turn around?  No, no, no, of course not.  No.  That's my head on the curb?  That's what, no, and I'm not saying that.  I understand that point.  No, of course not.  I'm not saying that Zimmerman should have just stood there and gotten beaten up, and I get 
[00:43:00]  why he shot him in that moment, which is why I do not want to see this guy in jail  for second-degree murder.  I agree with you.  The problem is the stuff leading up to that.  You were just a fan following me.  Again, when you look at the whole picture, the difference is he had a different thing  in mind when he was looking at Trayvon Martin.  And, again, we've gotten through this, but also I don't believe that he didn't know the  name of that street.  I just simply don't believe that.  So I don't believe that piece of testimony. 
[00:43:30]  And to me, there's all these little weird kinks in the road or crossroads where he might  have stopped and he didn't.  Again, in hindsight.  Right.  And while those things might not make him second-degree murder culpable, I don't believe  that he should have gotten off scot-free.  And that's why I'm saying that, not because it's...  But you can't just come up with some kind of mystery charge that you're not sure what  it should have been.  Well, I wish there was a lesser...  I'm sure you can, because I wish there was a lesser degree of manslaughter.  I wanted to see him get some kind of a manslaughter.  Well, they try to try... 
[00:44:00]  I mean, yours is involuntary.  I don't know in Florida.  But I don't even know if he should have gotten involuntary.  And there's also, you know, there's misdemeanors like assault and battery, but justification,  meaning...  Negates all that, yeah.  Then manslaughter is what I would have wanted to see him get.  Well, I mean...  Well, manslaughter was 15 years, right?  But he was...  Plus, I got his 30.  I didn't want to see him go to jail for a long time.  And he's defending himself.  How does he have to get something?  Why does he have to get charged with something when he was doing nothing more than defending 
[00:44:30]  his life?  Because I...  That's why I wanted to see him.  Because I don't believe that what he did falls under the same category as if someone  broke into your house and you shot them dead defending yourself.  I feel there's a difference.  And I...  Well, I know people are going to kill you.  You don't get...  Believe me.  I get it.  I know the facts.  I'm not saying fuck this piece of shit at all.  But I just don't say it's the same as you, Anthony, walking down the street as a law-abiding 
[00:45:00]  gun owner and some guy molesting you on the fucking train or attacking you on the street  and you're defending yourself.  Those, I'm 100% with you.  But in this one, there was obviously other stuff.  And maybe I can't find the proper charge because I understand it legally according to what the  law says.  I understand all that, too.  I know there's this...  No one ever wants to put any ill will or blame toward the dead victim.  I see the news is all over that. 
[00:45:30]  They don't want him to touch it.  But there does seem to be this aversion to saying, hey, if he just would have went home...  Yeah, he's the dead guy.  But you know what?  He shouldn't have punched him in the face.  I agree.  Not that everything...  George got out of the truck.  Wow, that's a terrible thing.  Let's weigh that with punching a man in the face and see what's the worst of the two.  But the one guy who spotted the other guy and made this a connection with this other  guy, like... 
[00:46:00]  And called the police and then kept an eye on him like he was told on the call.  Stopped following once he was told, you know, we don't need you to do that.  He was walking back to his truck.  I mean, all these things...  Again, I don't want to keep going because we already know.  The verdict is he was not guilty by an illegal...  He gets out of the truck because he knows he has a pistol.  But he doesn't just say that to the police.  He doesn't say, I got out of the car because I don't have a gun and I'm protected.  I'm protected.  He says, I wanted to see the street name. 
[00:46:30]  I simply don't believe that.  He was keeping an eye on him.  But he said he might...  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  The one eyewitness testified that he opened the door when he saw Trayvon beating the crap  out of George and he yelled out, I'm going to call 911 if you guys don't stop.  And George screamed, no, please come and help me.  That's not somebody who wants to pull up a gun and kill you.  You're right, and I agree, and I don't think he's... 
[00:47:00]  That's why I do not think he's a second-degree murderer.  And in that moment, I believe his self-defense.  That's the point maybe I don't make clearly.  I believe he shot him in self-defense.  And I absolutely buy that.  I know.  You're putting a lot into the...  The lead-up to it.  Which, again, I know legally that gets me nowhere.  I'm only telling you how I feel about it.  I don't say that...  He's just talking about raw emotions.  It just bothers me, and that's why it bothers me.  But I don't think you're right.  I don't think he meant to shoot him and wanted to shoot him.  Well, let's not go around in circles with Chris over here. 
[00:47:30]  Jesus Christ.  Chris, I got a question for you.  Have you seen George?  Yeah, he actually...  While we were talking just about three minutes ago, he just...  Oh, no, no, no.  George, I'm sorry.  Robert just called, so he's still on his way.  Okay.  But, no, I've on...  And anything I say, I want to preface by I've never spoken with George, and I've never spoken  with his legal team, who I have immense respect for, Mark O'Mara. 
[00:48:00]  You hang with his brother, and you don't even get to see the man.  That's a little strange.  Well, that's the reason why I was able to do speak on the case.  Yeah, yeah, I understand.  For legal reasons.  All right, Chris.  Are you coming over with Robert?  He's going to be in a little bit.  I'm going to be on the phone, if that's cool.  And I won't interject unless there's some kind of legal...  Legal thing, sure.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  We'll have you back on. 
[00:48:30]  He just walked in.  Hey, there he is.  What's up, Robert?  Good to see you, man.  Robert Zimmerman just walked into the studio.  There he is.  We were going to take a break and do the show.  Do we have nobody working for the show?  How did you just walk in?  I know.  He snuck up on us.  How you doing, Robert?  Do you have a gun?  At home?  All right.  Just want to make sure if we have a confrontation here, you don't shoot anybody.  Jesus.  You're profiling him.  Yes.  I know. 
[00:49:00]  Trying to bring some humor into this crazy world.  All right.  Robert.  What's up, Robert?  How you doing?  Good morning, guys.  You must be exhausted.  Very exhausted, but thanks for having me back.  You're all over the place.  It was over the weekend.  And it was kind of weird because no one had heard from you for a while.  Right.  You know, during the trial, you went to Twitter dark and TV shows and everything, and then  all of a sudden, it was good to see you back on TV again.  Thank you.  Were you, I know you must have had some concern and worries about what the verdict would have 
[00:49:30]  been, might have been.  Right up until the moment they announced it, what were your feelings?  I came to New York preemptively expecting the right verdict, and I think we got the right  verdict.  Yeah.  Obviously, it's cautious optimism, but they made the right call, and that's what we were  expecting.  Were you confident throughout?  Did you keep an eye on the trial?  I mean, he must have the entire time.  We could not watch the trial itself, nor be in the courtroom. 
[00:50:00]  Wow.  The only person who could be in the courtroom was our little sister, and that's because  of something called the rule of sequestration, where if you're a witness for either party,  you're excluded from the courtroom.  Right, right.  So, that must have been very frustrating, because you didn't know how well or bad of  a job the defense was doing for your brother, or how well or poorly the prosecution was doing.  Yeah, I mean, you see things come up on Twitter, or you get emails about stuff, or Google alerts, 
[00:50:30]  but you don't actually sit there and watch the testimony.  Wait, you weren't watching on CNN, like everyone else, the last few days?  He's not allowed to.  You're not even allowed to?  I mean, not during testimony, which is everything, but, you know, jury selection's fine, opening  statements, closing statements, those are non-evidentiary things, but once testimony  begins, no.  But are they making sure you're not watching, or are you taking a little peek here and there?  They're not, well, I mean, things, you know, come up, yeah, but you're not technically 
[00:51:00]  supposed to sit there and just watch it.  Right, right, yeah.  Wow.  I did not know that.  That's correct, because watching the trial, I was, you know, fully involved, watching pretty  much every minute of it.  But I noticed as time went by that this was really, obviously, a self-defense case.  The prosecution was really running around in circles.  The defense constantly had something to present.  Like O'Mara said, it was the Bizarro case. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, the prosecution was acting like the defense and vice versa.  So, me watching it, I was very confident that as long as you didn't have some kind of weird  thing and that X factor with the jury, you could always have that problem.  Sure.  But unless that happened, I absolutely saw an acquittal coming.  Yeah, yeah.  So, it must have been rough for you not having seen it.  It is kind of bizarre not following it that way, but I don't think we needed a trial to 
[00:52:00]  tell us what really happened.  Right.  In the situation, we knew it happened.  It happened since February of last year.  Yeah.  So, now, after the verdict comes through, did you watch the, on TV?  I tried to watch it on TV.  We got an announcement there would be a verdict.  I was in my hotel lobby and my phone got so many tweets and emails and texts that it just  kind of like started floating up in the air because it was just blowing up and I got to  a TV as fast as I could and I missed the live reading, but I did see it at CNN later. 
[00:52:30]  How nervous were you when they said the verdict is coming?  Regardless of what you feel, it's still got to be a terrible nerve-wracking moment.  Yes, it is.  We had heard that there were, there was a question, a jury question.  They wanted clarification on the manslaughter instruction.  So, that was encouraging because it kind of told me that if the jurors were going through  the instructions chronologically that they had gone past murder two or they would have 
[00:53:00]  just convicted of murder two right then and there.  And a lot of people were also saying, yeah, Anthony, what do you think of this?  They want, they have a question about manslaughter.  Does that mean they're looking to give them manslaughter?  I was like, they have to understand the charge before they could then understand what the  justification to negate that charge is.  Yes.  His self-defense justification.  So, I didn't feel that was a hurdle or anything.  And like you said, I thought it was a good thing because it pretty much threw away the 
[00:53:30]  murder two, which I think they looked at and didn't even have to then look at the self-defense.  I think they knew murder two just didn't apply regardless of self-defense in that situation.  I mean, I tend to agree or they probably, or you never know, but they might have asked  for some kind of clarification as to murder two.  But the way, I mean, manslaughter, the way when you just say it, it means a man was slaughtered.  You know, someone killed someone.  And it's defined so differently in every jurisdiction that, you know, non-attorneys coming and seeing  something like that, the way that it is excused under the manslaughter instruction is either 
[00:54:00]  justifiable or excusable.  Right.  And justifiable is in your dwelling or to prevent a forcible felony, like you're getting robbed  and you shoot someone, for example, and then excusable has its other stipulations.  But then when you get to the self-defense instruction, which is the justifiable use of force, that  kind of is a defense for both of them.  So I think that's what happened.  Why do you, what do you think it is that your brother represents? 
[00:54:30]  Cause you know, I had my issues with the, with the vertical, although I did not want to  see him go to jail for murder two, but what do you think it is that he represents that's  got people so upset?  Cause I don't think it's just George Zimmerman or Trayvon Martin.  And he, he'd become like, like these things happen that make the whole country kind of  focus and it means something more.  The reprehensible media probably has a lot to do with.  I do.  I think that when this happened in the beginning, there was, there was just George and Trayvon  Martin, you know, for about a day.  Um, and I think that after, and you know, in my view, uh, Ms. Fulton and Mr. Martin had 
[00:55:00]  grief like any parent would.  I think their grief was exploited.  That's really what I feel in my heart by Mr. Benjamin Crump and Ms. Natalie Jackson.  And they started a race narrative, a smear campaign that the media was all too happy to.  Oh, they love that.  Yeah.  They love it.  Yeah.  And so that's what that, you know, repeating white man, black child gated community, you  know, over and over and over again has its, has its effect. 
[00:55:30]  And that's what it, uh, that's where the snowball effect, I guess, started and combined with  the vacuum of not knowing anything about George.  And then we start to find things out about George and then like, he's not white, you  know, and then the term white Hispanic gets coined.  And then we start, you know, finding out more about George and then NBC edits their tapes  to say, there's someone suspicious here.  He's black.  He's wearing a hoodie.  In essence.  And it also didn't help that President Obama got involved.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Right.  I don't, I don't think it, uh, I don't think it did.  I don't think anyone really would have known how to make sense of that at the time.  I think, you know, my opinion is it was kind of a missed opportunity to be presidential  and to just take race off the table.  You know, I don't, I think a white president saying, you know, if I had a son, he would  have looked like whomever would have been laughed out of office.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Putting the race angle in there was a little silly.  I thought, I don't know that didn't, and again, I, I know Obama probably meant that. 
[00:56:30]  I, that's one of those with kind of like, you, you have a certain deniability there.  I think he could have also meant it in a very parental way.  Uh, but you know, it could have been racial or it could have been.  What would I bring it up?  He would have looked like, not acted, not been, not, you know, he's, he's basing it  on color of skin.  No, he would look like Trayvon Martin.  Like I could see myself in a parent's shoes.  Like that could be my son.  I, I didn't take it.  Like he meant literally like, you know, he would have the same skin tone, you know, you  know, but, but, and Jimmy, you gotta, you gotta consider, um, what were the Zimmerman  parents coming through? 
[00:57:00]  I think that's, yeah, that's something that only we felt that, um, I guess attack at the  time.  My dad referred to it as hate.  You know, I, I don't have a son, but if I did have a son, uh, I would hope that we would  investigate whatever caused his death.  And I don't think I have to put my ethnicity or my race into that statement.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, the press, the press was, was reprehensible.  Like they were disgusting with how they, they, you know, there was nothing fair about the  way they had, they had, even on the cover of the daily news today.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[00:57:30]  It's a picture of a, an empty hoodie and it lists, you know, Emma too, Willie, I work  with a microgram, when will it end?  Like they're just completely biased and they don't admit that they are, they act like they're  just delivering news in unbiased fashion.  Yeah.  And I think that there's this, uh, there's this, you know, I don't know, effort to kind  of label what happened here in this particular case with, with, or, or paint it with a broad  brush of gun violence.  And that's, that was right out of the current playbook of sexless gun violence, you know, 
[00:58:00]  an act of self-defense has now rolled into this, uh, broad category that has, it has nothing  to do with gun violence.  Well, because if, if you call it gun violence, you don't have to address the real issue, which  was, uh, first of all, there's a huge issue with black on black crime in major cities  that doesn't get any attention.  And, uh, also responsibility, personal responsibility.  Um, you, a lot of emotion came into this case, obviously, but if you look at what happened, 
[00:58:30]  um, you'll watch the news now, you'll never know Trayvon even touched George.  You will not hear word one.  You will hear unarmed teen walking home with his kittles, uh, gets gunned down by, uh, neighborhood  watch guy.  Now he, he was, uh, shot because, uh, he was walking black.  He was a black man, boy walking home, nothing anymore since the trial's over about him beating  your brother's head. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  There's all these different directions that kind of the bar keeps getting lowered.  It's that, or it's, you know, um, you know, but if you're, if you're, if you're having  a fist fight, you shouldn't just pull out your gun and shoot someone, you know, and, and  people say yes.  And thanks for coming on my program, you know, and they leave it at that, you know, it's,  it's nauseating.  That's not what happened.  If someone tries to take your gun, uh, I've never had my nose broken, but I imagine from  what I hear, it's quite a, uh, a blindsiding and disorienting injury as it is in pitch 
[00:59:30]  black, having your head pounded in the concrete after that.  And then someone telling you, I'm going to kill you.  And then trying to take your gun.  Yeah.  I don't think you have much of a choice.  Now, people who don't like guns would rather that gun not have been there no matter what  would have happened.  No matter what.  Right.  Right.  So they, they, they are the ones who resort to lowering the bar by saying, you know, well,  it was just a fist fight.  And, you know, this guy had skittles, but this guy brought a gun.  Well, people in our society are armed.  And if you go and break people's noses and sit on them and pummel them and rain down 
[01:00:00]  blows, and you don't know that they're armed, you might unfortunately find yourself at, at,  uh, on the business end of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  And that's, and again, I, I believe his self-defense.  Like I do believe he was being beaten up and I believe Trayvon Martin was kicking the  shit out of him.  I don't fault him for pulling that.  It's really weird feelings I have about it.  Cause I don't think that he's this terrible.  I, I, I, I have a hard time believing that he didn't know the name of that street when he got  out of the car that that's a really tough one for me to swallow that he did not know  the name of the street.  What would be the motive of him not, um, not telling the police what the name of the street 
[01:00:30]  is though?  Honestly, I think he did say the name of that street, but I don't think he said the name  of where he had last lost sight of Trayvon was there.  It wasn't a street.  It was like a cross between homes.  Um, and I, I think if you hear the recording, there is, he does say a retreat view circle  or whatever, but he doesn't know what the, when you cross behind homes and you just come  out on this other road, um, that there's no way you would have driven it.  You don't drive that. 
[01:01:00]  You have to like walk it to get there.  And yeah, there are only three streets, but I guess in that, uh, at that time, at that moment,  he didn't know it exactly.  And he's, he was trying to get the best information.  Yeah.  That one, that one has been very difficult for me.  And again, I don't think that means that he said out because I'm going to hunt this  guy down, you know, uh, the judge Alex, again, I have to credit him, raised good points  about, well, sometimes you, uh, you say things to make yourself look a little bit better,  uh, even though what you're saying is basically, remember he said that?  Like what you're saying is basically true. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  I just, I simply don't, I think that he wanted, again, this is my opinion.  I think that he wanted to further the contact, but not to a point of violence and not to  a point of, I think that he wanted to be there when the cops got there and had the  cops go, great job.  You got him.  I think that he wanted this to go a little further.  I, I would think that he was just watching him.  There was no indication before or during what happened that would lead me to believe he  wanted to confront him. 
[01:02:00]  He was on the phone with the police.  He had called them.  He knew the police were literally minutes away.  He wanted to watch him so he could go there, officer.  There he is.  He walked around that way.  He went this way.  I kept my eye on him.  And now finally you guys are here and we know where this guy is.  He went in that house or he got in a car and left or whatever.  Something.  But it seems to me that the, the narrative here that people want you to believe is the  second he got out of that car, he became this hunter.  There's no gray area. 
[01:02:30]  There's no, he got out of the car to look around the corner and see where he went.  He got out of the car to keep an eye on him.  He got out of the car to follow him from 20 yards behind, never getting any closer.  It's once he got out of the car, he was pouncing on him.  That's not what I'm saying though.  But that's what a lot of people.  That's the power of words.  And I think right out of Crump's script, the word pursuit has a very specific implication.  It's supposed to follow.  You can follow something perpetually, but pursuing means you intend to. 
[01:03:00]  Stalking was another one that was used.  And, and following even sounded ominous when they put it in the context of what happened.  Well, yeah, it became synonymous.  I mean, with, with pursuing or hunting down or whatever, after you, after you repeat that  enough.  Chased.  It was another one.  He chased down this boy and it's like, God, stop with trying to make this something.  It's not right.  What's, uh, what's George been doing since the verdict?  Uh, my understanding is he's resting a lot.  Just resting?  A lot.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  A lot.  Just kind of decompressing.  And, you know, is he in hiding kind of, or?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  I mean, we all are in, in Florida.  Right.  We're all different places.  Have you debated leaving Florida?  Like, it may not at this moment, but at some point, like this is probably not the place  to be.  Yeah.  The debate was very short.  It's not the place to be.  I, I, I, I, I feel like it, I, I feel a little bit more concerned for George because he hasn't 
[01:04:00]  been doing that.  You know, he's been, he's George, and now when the trial came up again and people are  seeing him day in and day out, um, he had a very strict curfew, uh, before in, in his  house, uh, by 6 p.m.  For most of his, uh, trial, it later got extended to 10 p.m.  Because of kind of the later, you know, court sessions that we're having.  Um, and having an ankle monitor and this awkward device you carry around with you the size of  a Starbucks cup, you know, that communicates with that ankle monitor that kind of says, 
[01:04:30]  if you thought I was George Zimmerman, now I really am George Zimmerman.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  You have to wear the right shoes.  You're always paranoid of getting it wet or straying too far from that, uh, I think they  call it a PTU, a personal tracking unit or whatever.  You go more than a hundred feet from it and you're back in jail and you have that paranoia  for a long time and it's an adjustment.  What was going on outside the house every night?  There had to be people around all the time, right?  No, we, we, that's gotta be really creepy.  We just vanished off the face of the earth and just nobody knows where we are at all. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  No one figured it out.  No one figured it out.  They tried.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure.  That's why I'm asking.  I would, in this day and age, I would assume they would, uh, find out where you guys were.  Or, you know, Spike Lee's probably looking so he could tweet it out.  Well, that's amazingly ignorant to tweet out the, especially of the, of the sample.  Or even the guy before he's been through court, you can't fucking Twitter somebody's  address.  Yeah.  And he got the wrong people.  I know.  Of course.  Poor old couple.  It's like, what?  What happened? 
[01:05:30]  You guys picked that terrible.  You guys picked a, um, a house or an apartment complex where you got neighbors that are just  clueless, huh?  That not one person saw like, we do think George getting fresh air or opening a window or something.  Well, we do things, um, very discreetly, very, very discreetly.  I understand all that.  But in this day and age, that is really hard to do no matter who you are.  Well, they found us last time, you know, so we wisened up and learned from it.  And what kind of life you think George is going to have now?  I mean, a lot of people say his life is ruined. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, I would agree.  You know, um, it, it won't be the same and it'll have this other dimension of looking over  your shoulder all the time.  Um, I don't know that if you asked George that he would even be able to answer that  question.  Right.  I mean, this is like the second day of freedom.  Yeah.  It's almost like a new, you know, reality.  And there's a theory he gained all that weight.  So now he could lose the weight and he could kind of sneak back into society.  That, that was going around Twitter for a while.  Yeah.  I've heard all kinds of theories about the weight to make him look like a, you know, out of 
[01:06:30]  shape, unable to defend himself or whatever.  He just gained weight because he, the stress of that, you know, it's got, you got to be,  you know, the depression that you'd feel also being in that situation.  You're going to help him out, put him on the workout regimen you're on or something.  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try to motivate him as best I can.  Yeah.  What does he do from here though?  Like, okay, he's, he's acquitted, but like for the right, like I'm thinking like if  he gets married in 15 years, he'll be like, you know, Trayvon Martin, killer George, like  he's always going to have that side. 
[01:07:00]  It's not like he can go fill out a job application and have you ever been charged with any felonies?  Yes.  Right.  Right.  You know, but, um, uh, he's suing NBC.  We'll see.  I agree with that.  I think he should sue the news apartment.  It was terrible.  Absolutely.  That was a terrible edit.  And what about CNN?  I guess, uh, broadcast his social security number and, uh, they did.  I, I don't, I don't.  You know, I don't know who's, I think obviously that's CNN's fault for their standards of care,  but somebody put it up on that screen.  So there might be more than one party responsible. 
[01:07:30]  They put it on the screen.  Oh yeah.  They put it on the screen in court.  Yeah.  On the screen in court.  Which was bad enough for the public in a non-broadcast trial.  Right.  You know, to see people's social and everything.  But yeah.  And they made a big deal of, uh, people were gloating about stealing his identity and everything  else.  So it's like, first of all, why would you now want, I don't think his credit rating is going  to be very good for a while as far as, give it a whirl.  Yeah.  Can you get a new number?  Can you get a new social security number?  I think you can.  I think you can. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  People are outraged, uh, that he gets his gun back.  That's a big story today in the paper.  Yeah.  I, I mean, I understand that.  I, I think people put a lot of symbolism in that gun.  Um, he, in fact, committed no crime.  We have the presumption of innocence that we carry when we're accused and that presumption  of innocence, uh, doesn't leave us.  You know, we are presumed innocent when we're found not guilty.  That same presumption applies.  So if he, in fact, committed no crime, there's no reason.  He leaves that court the same way he was before the crime was ever committed. 
[01:08:30]  So why, do you think though, and again, I know this is kind of a fucking, you know,  like a pukey left-wing college professor question, but do you think that, uh, while we do have  the presumption of innocence, do you think that that was kind of a, and again, a courtesy  he didn't afford Trayvon Martin walking through that, uh, complex was the presumption of innocence.  I think it's clear to me when I hear what happened and when I talk to George when this 
[01:09:00]  happened, that something aroused his suspicion.  And again, this, this notion that Trayvon was walking, I, I just don't, I don't agree  with that.  I think my brother would have to be, you know, crazy to pick up the phone and call the police  because someone was walking.  It sounds to me more like someone was loitering, you know, loitering aimlessly, uh, not in its  pouring rain.  It's not something that happens in that subdivision.  People know where they live and they walk in their house, you know, or did he say what,  what he was doing? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  He said it in the call.  He said, there's this guy out here just standing out here between the houses, looking at the  homes and it's, it's rain, it's raining.  He looks suspicious.  Um, and, and he said in subsequent reports, you know, that that's what aroused his suspicion  was just this kind of like nonchalant attitude about being where he was.  He wasn't in front of a house.  He wasn't like in a driveway.  He wasn't like locked out of a home or trying to get in it.  He was actually between homes.  Uh, and one of those homes had actually, uh, been broken into. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know if you've heard of Frank Taffey, but that was the house that got broken.  Yeah.  Crazy Frank, crazy Frank, but, but that was one of the homes.  And, and, uh, you know, unfortunately in that community, when people do that, um, as we  heard from the witness on the stand, when someone came to her door and started beating on the  door and you might get people running around the back and coming in or someone's just kind  of standing around as a lookout or whatever.  So I don't think, I think people think of what happened and don't put it into context 
[01:10:30]  of what was happening around George, around that community.  I think that that particular witness on the stand that talked about being, you know, having  the scissors in one hand, her baby in the other and backed into a corner in a room on the  phone with the dispatcher.  And there's these three guys in her house, just stealing whatever they want.  Um, that's the reality of that community.  You know, your home gets invaded.  And if you don't have the means to defend yourself too bad.  And if you backtrack from the shooting to what George was doing that evening with that 
[01:11:00]  hindsight, you could say anything, what he should have done, what he shouldn't have done,  uh, this, but in context, as he's driving out, he sees this, why wouldn't you do something?  Why wouldn't you call the cops?  It's, and if the shooting never happened, like I said, you never would have heard of  this.  It would have been George calling the cops, the cops showing up, maybe talking to Trayvon,  maybe not, maybe, you know, all that would have been fine. 
[01:11:30]  Everything leading up to the shooting still would have been completely fine.  Why, because of the shooting, now I understand this sounds weird, because of the shooting,  everything before it is bad?  No, it, it, it was perfectly reasonable for a man that's familiar with what's going on  in his neighborhood to see an anomaly and go, I want to look into this.  I want the police to look into it.  Yeah, I wish there were like an animation now that trial is over.  So people can understand where he was, where this guy was, why that was weird that he was 
[01:12:00]  there, how many times the homes around where he was standing had been broken into.  Had been broken into.  And when this notion, put this notion to rest of following, hunting down, pursuing, stalking,  whatever, because as soon as he gets out of his truck and starts walking in the direction  where he already saw him ran, he says, I can't see this guy, he's gone.  He ran, he took off.  Yep.  That's it.  You know, so you can't follow or pursue or hunt down, which you can't see.  It's like, oh, he's gone.  But in hindsight, in hindsight, one thing about hindsight is that when they looked at 
[01:12:30]  what Trayvon Martin had on him, he didn't have burglary tools, and then people kind  of know, well, he left the All-Star game, he was coming back to watch, he was talking  to that fucking amazing, that he could hold a conversation with that Rachel Jantel, whatever  her name was.  That's what he was talking.  So when you look, hindsight shows us that he really wasn't doing anything, while you  understand why somebody might go, hey, what's he doing?  But he really wasn't.  Right, but I think that's taking, that's taking like an extra step.  He was pursuing getting codeine and trying to make purple drink.  What's that? 
[01:13:00]  We know that now.  Yeah, but I mean, that's kind of like even assuming that George would have thought that.  I don't think he thought that.  I don't think George sees a person and has an issue with that person.  I think George sees his neighbors and takes issue with keeping them safe or their homes  not invaded.  Right.  So then this guy's going to burglarize, but he might be here to rape, or he might be here  to be an arsonist, or he might be here, like he's not getting into people's heads.  You know, but I think he just saw this guy around these homes that had been victimized  and call the cops.  But in fairness, that is, it's just a different way of saying it. 
[01:13:30]  Like that's he, I understand.  I don't think he was out to fuck Trayvon.  I think that he cared about his neighbors.  However, when you, when you care about your neighbors and you see a guy there who you  interpret as obviously some sort of possible threat to your neighbors, you are making a  judgment on that person because you're interpreting as a post.  If that was a 75 year old woman just standing there with a cane, it wouldn't have struck  him.  So he did make a snap judgment, which again, I get why he made it.  And I probably would have made the same one. 
[01:14:00]  But I mean, why wouldn't, why wouldn't you look at somebody as suspicious if he fits the  description of people that have done robberies and burglaries in the neighborhood as opposed  to, you know, if 12 times an old woman had broken into that, then he absolutely would  have called the cops.  I don't know.  And I'm not playing that.  Like, I feel as comfortable with an old, an old, you know, a young Islamic guy on a plane 
[01:14:30]  to do an old, like I get why profiling means something.  Of course.  Yeah.  And again, that, that word profiling, it's, I, I have to just repeat, you know, George  called the police on white people, Hispanic people, black people, because a garage door  was open because kids are playing in the street and at a bad corner and somebody might've hit  him or whatever.  He said on many of those calls, I don't want to approach these people.  I don't want to get near them.  You know, there's evidence of that.  If you listen to a lot of those calls, I think what was, you know, clear in that community  was the area, the geography around where Trayvon was, was kind of, and now there's a fence 
[01:15:00]  there, but there wasn't at the time.  This was this cut through where a lot of crime came and went.  And I don't think he made a judgment so much about Trayvon just simply being there as much  as the NAACP wants you to think it's because he was black or Al Sharpton wants you to think  because it's a hoodie or whatever.  It's because those actual homes that are right there really were getting robbed.  So people in that community, I think had a, you know, a way to go about their life.  And, you know, we know now that George probably really did know his neighbors really well 
[01:15:30]  because he hadn't ever seen that guy before.  And it turns out he was right.  You know, so that's all he knew about Trayvon was that he was a stranger, some guy he'd never  seen before.  And he is around.  If someone pulls a fire alarm, you don't look at the guy that's in the bathroom and go,  you look like a trickster to me.  So it was probably you.  You go and look at who's standing near the fire alarm.  You know, and I think that that guy was just standing near the things that had been  victimized. 
[01:16:00]  That's what was profiled.  Absolutely.  However, though, I'm sorry, if it was a couple of days after the fire alarm got pulled, it  would be a bit of a different story.  If it's like if that was in a moment of a robbery, of course, I wouldn't even be saying  that.  But it was it was I think what again what happened, we all these common sense dictates to me why  he saw Trayvon.  And I know George can't come out and say this.  And I don't think he's a terrible person for looking at the reality was in that moment  Trayvon Martin was doing nothing wrong.  He really this is one case where I think if you profile people and by profile, you just 
[01:16:30]  mean make a judgment by looking at somebody according to what other people who look like  that person have done.  And it's accurate because positive profiles happen all the time.  Nobody minds fucking Dominican pride, you know, but if you say something bad, people  hit it.  Personally, I think that he he made a snap judgment about a guy who in that case just was  not doing anything wrong.  And that's it.  That's that's the danger of it is that this type of stuff happens where you get a guy  who just wasn't doing anything wrong and right up until he punched him in the face. 
[01:17:00]  The initial contact.  Yes.  At the same time, George wasn't doing anything wrong either.  That's true.  Very true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, so what?  Well, I got it.  I got it.  Yeah.  Sure.  Oh, not.  I guess a strange question.  So the verdict is read in there and they go to George.  OK, you're free to go.  How the fuck does he leave?  I need to know how he got out of there.  He went on the the he had been leaving through the regular door of the the courtroom. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  You know, when he was incarcerated, they bring you through a door that, you know, kind of  leads you through the back.  But it turned out this time that's the door he went through.  Right.  To go and get security.  He couldn't leave with our parents through the regular door of the courtroom.  I don't mean the courthouse.  I mean, just the courtroom.  Right.  The room.  Yeah.  So he went out a separate entrance.  And then what what kind of vehicle did he get?  Because I need to know.  I know.  There were all those protesters out there.  And I mean, if I was in that situation, they're like, you're free to go.  I'd be like, well, wait a minute.  Yeah.  They took care of his security. 
[01:18:00]  And that was, you know, step one is that if it didn't matter what the media couldn't  figure out what car he was in.  No.  That's so amazing to me in this day and age.  Can I tell you one thing he should do for the record?  Get rid of that gun.  Seriously.  Have it for real.  Have it destroyed and have it public knowledge because that becomes a trophy for anybody  who wants to get that gun and make a statement.  Get rid of that fucking gun.  You got to get a new gun.  I wouldn't disagree. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, I don't get being entitled to get your gun or other property back is different  from him having some kind of fixation with that.  Right.  But let the public know it's gone.  Get rid of it.  Because then somebody all of a sudden is like, hey, I want to get that gun just in honor  of get rid of it.  Yeah, exactly.  How do you feel about it?  This is the only time I've ever disagreed with Robert.  But I think that gun is the last thing that's going to keep him safe, personally.  No, I think it's the symbol of that gun. 
[01:19:00]  I understand what Jimmy's saying.  I mean, get rid of that gun.  And if you want to continue to carry, go get another one.  Oh, get a gun.  Yeah.  He has to have one now.  I know what Jimmy's saying.  But that particular gun is kind of a target in a weird way.  It becomes a symbol of the gun that some asshole.  And again, if you go out and you harm George Zimmerman, you're an asshole.  And somebody would want to harm him just to get that gun that shot Trayvon.  Get rid of the one that shot Trayvon.  Or just sell fake ones on Ebay and represent them to be a gun.  But you've got to realize, if he went out to get a new gun, it's going to be all over 
[01:19:30]  the news, too.  Oh, another death thing.  No, no, not in Florida.  There's no registration.  Oh, there isn't?  No, you just go buy a gun.  And as long as the person you go to is over 18.  That seems crazy.  Wow.  Robert, so you were in New York last night?  Yes.  What do you think of all the protesters marching all over the place?  Times Square had a lot of people.  I would assume you were close to Times Square last night.  I was, and we didn't know what was happening.  And the driver could not get to the Fox building.  And I decided with my friend who I was with, why don't we get out and walk? 
[01:20:00]  And Fox had told, all they had told me was, do not get out and walk.  Before this, you know, because I didn't know if it was for time or what.  They didn't tell me.  So I get out and start walking.  And I guess I'm on, I look down 6th, and I see people backed up.  You know, and I was like, oh, shoot, that's that demonstration.  Oh, my God.  So Fox took really good care of me.  They came out, they met me on the street, and there were like 50 officers that ran out 
[01:20:30]  of the Fox between the doors.  I don't know where they came from, because I went in the back door on 48th.  And they just like rushed out into the street.  And they got me in there with a lot of security and out of there through side doors.  Wow.  Different doors.  Imagine getting caught up in that, where the people think it's like, hey, look, it's  Robert Hitler coming down the street.  No, then you better just start chanting with them, boo, George, boo, George.  You better fucking jump right in. 
[01:21:00]  Right to the Fox door.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah, so he should get rid of that.  I'm going to say that again for the rest.  Get rid of the gun and get a new one.  That's a bad fucking thing to hold on to.  How was the family, parents and whatnot?  They were very emotional that day.  The next day, they just kind of rested.  It was like a pajama Sunday.  You know, and they're also getting used to this new reality where they're not the family  of the accused.  You know, they're the family of the exonerated.  So that's different. 
[01:21:30]  And I think they're going to take some time off.  I think everybody's going to kind of get away for a while before we kind of regroup and go  from there.  But just kind of get out of town until things boil over a little bit.  Yeah.  I think that's the smartest thing to do.  Absolutely.  Lay low.  Relax.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did you think of the lawyer's job?  Obviously, they did a great job.  Amazing job.  I never doubted Mark's presentation ever for a second. 
[01:22:00]  I never doubted Don West's examination of very technical or more sophisticated things  in court.  Yeah.  Never for a second.  Enough that I got here because I knew what the verdict would be.  Right.  When I saw Mark's closing argument, I was like, wow, this is like brilliant.  It was amazing.  He was impressive, man.  The way he kept on that jury about burden of proof and justification and telling them,  look, you can't just make things up based on what the prosecution did. 
[01:22:30]  And then he would give them the evidence.  Now, here's evidence.  And then again, he'd go back to, but let's remember, the burden of proof.  But it was an amazing mix of everything he needed to tell that jury.  And then even the rebuttal by the prosecution was so out there and vague and, you know.  It was emotion versus facts.  Completely.  Completely, yes.  If you had to boil it down in two words, is these are the facts. 
[01:23:00]  This is what was not proven and this is our burden in this country.  And then here's what these people want to yell and scream and, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, you're not supposed to see the prosecution going, what if?  Let's assume.  What if this happened?  What if the, no, they're supposed to be the ones that said this happened.  Could it have been the sprinkler?  Could it have been?  It's like, no, that's what the defense says.  Or you decide.  He kept saying you decide.  That really was a bad, you know.  I thought emotionally he did a good job.  Hey, that's you right there on the TV.  That's me.  That's you right there. 
[01:23:30]  That's me and Chris Cuomo's trying to get me.  He did try to get you.  I watched that last night.  Yeah, he told, he had that interview with Sean Hannity and that was, you know, presented in court as well.  And I don't think that people who are forthcoming and forthright with what they do and believe they're doing the right thing should then go back.  That's the way we were taught always as children.  If you do the right thing all the time or what you believe to be right, you don't have to go back and make amends for that and say it should have been this way.  If it should have been that way now and you can think of that in hindsight, then it should have been that way then.  Will George carry a gun now? 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  You know, I heard from Piers Morgan actually last night that his gun was returned to him or that at least he's eligible to have it returned to him.  I don't know that he'll carry a gun.  I would think that he has more reason to now than before because there are so many more people who want him dead and that know that he's free.  But at the same time, he can move about a little bit more than he did before.  I will say, equally handsome in person.  Yeah, he was trying to get, like, you know, like.  The attorney had said, of course, he feels regret.  You know, no one ever wants to end up in this situation. 
[01:24:30]  I found that interesting because they were a little different on that issue.  I think his brother was seizing upon that word.  I think there's such sensitivity surrounding all the legalities that are going on here.  They want to make sure he had his brother's best interest.  Regret implies.  He took every question that there was.  Regret is different than remorse.  Yes.  You can't say I had to do this or I would be dead.  I had to do this action to save my life.  And I really regret doing it.  Yeah.  Because that means you shouldn't have done it.  But you can give it regret as an overall look.  I regret this whole thing.  I regret the entire day happened.  You know, you can regret something in the abstract. 
[01:25:00]  More importantly, we asked way better questions than CNN.  Yeah.  And there's remorse in feeling sorrowful about something or having, you know.  I think what George said there is that he wished that there had been some other outcome.  Some other.  Wishing is fine, too.  Anything else he could have done.  Right.  You know, but this is what had to be done.  I want to ask, too.  Yeah.  What did you think when you heard the opening joke?  Oh, God.  By the defiant.  Like, just as people in George's family and the attorney, did you guys go, oh, my, there  goes the case. 
[01:25:30]  Well, we understood what he was doing.  Then Alan Dershowitz said it was grounds for a, I think he did a mistrial.  Grounds for a mistrial.  It was the first sentence, so that was kind of weird, for lack of competent counsel.  But I understood what he was trying to do.  I think those jurors were, it wasn't funny.  And they changed their tone right away.  And I think they got the message loud and clear.  But, yeah, it was a little bizarre.  Yeah.  And then he had to say, come on, that's funny.  Oh, boy.  You never want to have to say that.  What did you think, Chris, as an attorney? 
[01:26:00]  Oh, that is definitely not the way you want to start out a murder two case.  I mean, there's nothing funny about it.  And you don't have a rapport with the jury yet on it.  I mean, it was Don's only mistake.  I mean, I have immense respect for him.  But I was watching that live, and I saw that, and I was like, holy shit, who looks stupid enough?  And it scared the hell out of me.  And then, you know, he calmed down.  I mean, a knock-knock joke.  And then, I mean, he set it up for about a half hour. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, my God.  The set-up went forever.  It was just poorly told.  Here's what he should have done.  As a comedian who has bombed many times, he should have played that off like he meant  it serious.  Like, when it bombed, he should have made it look like he was making an overall statement.  Like, knock-knock, who's there?  You know, you're on the trial, whatever it was he said.  He should have said, and that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.  He should have put it on some serious...  Like, yeah, like, of course I didn't mean that humorously.  Oh, boy.  Oof. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  I mean, it really should have been...  If he was going to tell a joke like that, it should have been done during jury selection.  Right, right.  During selection, maybe.  It was just...  And boy, thank God the news didn't show it too much.  It was all they showed over and over again.  Can I be honest?  There's something beautiful about what he said.  This is where he reacted like a comedian.  What?  Nothing?  Nothing?  I know.  What?  Nothing?  That's something Rich Voss would say in Connecticut.  What?  Nothing?  I don't blame the media for playing it. 
[01:27:30]  That was way too easy.  Over and over again.  Robert, you handled yourself well in front of the media.  I mean, all these guys gave you tough questions and stuff, and I thought you did a great job  for your brother.  What's going to happen to you now?  Do you want to go into something like that?  I think after tomorrow, I'm just going to spend time at home and decompress and relax and reconnect  and reassess.  What do you do for work now before you finish?  This.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, for free.  This doesn't pay very much.  What did you do before this? 
[01:28:00]  I was a for-hire musician.  I worked under contract for an agency that hired out musicians and sent them to different  venues to do classical music.  What's your instrument?  Voice tenor.  Wow, really?  Really?  Yeah.  So I have to leave my American spirits out of the picture now, because I kind of picked  up that habit a little from all of this.  Stress and pressure.  Smoking does rule when you're stressed out.  Yes, it does.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[01:28:30]  Well, you know, I've got to get you over the house to sing some karaoke with me then.  Oh, okay.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Yeah, that is kind of a cool place to go and hang out and just lose yourself in a sea  of alcoholism.  And vomit.  And vomit.  Listen.  Oh, my God.  Now, I could see you doing this for a living, man, because you handled yourself well on TV.  Yeah, very good.  Given your opinions on other things.  I think that there, I think Georgia's railroaded, and I feel, I think that what I did in a word,  what I tried to do was advocacy.  And hopefully, you know, this doesn't happen again, but if it does, I will make sure that 
[01:29:00]  that person has an advocate.  And sometimes the best advocate is an attorney in the legal sense.  And there's also advocacy in the public realm, the rhetorical sense, and trying to make sense  out of things for people who are just hearing one side of something.  And what I definitely learned is never, ever allow there to be a vacuum just because the  Black Panthers are trying to kill you or whatever.  Or, you know, don't just let other people fill in the blanks for your life or your loved 
[01:29:30]  one's life.  You have to be right there in front when people are calling you racist and the police department  racist and everything else.  You have to fight fire with fire early and often.  Absolutely.  What a contrast you are from Frank Taffy.  Yes, I know.  I've heard.  What's Frank's deal?  What's like his history?  He's a good, he has a good heart.  Yeah.  He has, he's lost two sons.  Yeah, he's talked about that.  Yeah.  And I think that he has also kind of opened up about that. 
[01:30:00]  Maybe he feels that this is, you know, kind of like he sees George as a son, perhaps the  one he actually can protect from his demise at the hands of Miss Corey, you know, or whatever.  But he, Frank started in a good place.  And I think Frank is unique in that he gets that community.  He actually lived there.  His home was actually burglarized.  He'd actually see the police take Frank and George out of it.  A community of 200 homes in 13 months, there's 400 calls to the police. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  You do the math.  And now you'll start to begin to understand, you know, the, like how on edge people were  that live there anyway, you know, that, that 400 times in 13 months, a community of roughly  200 homes calls the cops.  So that's, those cops are going out there all the time.  Yeah.  You come home, there's cops, you know, you leave for work and one of these cops at somebody  else's house.  You might get a call that your home was burglarized that day or whatever, you know? 
[01:31:00]  So I think when, when Frank was particularly incensed that the racial narrative,  was, uh, making traction.  And, and he, for the way he saw it was nobody really understands retreat at Twin Lakes and  what an awful place this is to live, you know, and this isn't a real gated community.  It's just a very normal.  Right.  Right.  Is the community kind of surrounded by a crime ridden area?  Is that how it works?  Is it?  Because a lot of times you find like a nice neighborhood kind of surrounded by a rougher  neighborhood.  My, my understanding roughly is that it kind of does butt up on one side against a rougher 
[01:31:30]  neighborhood and a lot of, uh, people, but not all people, but you know, would come from  that community or kind of just commit crime and vanish into that community.  Right.  Um, but you know, they, they, they caught, uh, people in, in, uh, in the community robbing  from their neighbors too.  So it wasn't, you know, necessarily that it came from that, but yeah, that was an issue.  Sounds exhausting to live there.  Yeah.  Right.  Jesus.  Can you think of somebody who was the unfairest in the press to your brother and not necessarily 
[01:32:00]  like, you know, again, Oh, NBC, which was, which was, which was reprehensible, but like,  is there like a guy like was it?  Piers Morgan or one of these guys that you thought was just got it wrong.  I bet Nancy Grace is up there.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  I mean, her sexual appeal aside, the delightful woman.  Just a delight.  She really is.  Yes.  Yes.  Frankenberry, you're on the phone.  It's just a ray of sunshine, isn't she?  She's really a wonderful, wonderful woman.  Has she ever seen a, uh, a sunny day?  Holy fuck.  Just an atrocity.  Was she the unfairest?  Who would you say we've got it wrong? 
[01:32:30]  The hushest.  Sure.  She's unfair.  I don't think people take her very credibly.  Right.  I don't think, I don't think she can do that much damage.  It's kind of like watching, uh, a parody of herself when you watch that show.  It really is.  She's the only one who doesn't know it.  Wow.  Very good.  Seriously, very good.  Have you spoken to her?  Like, did you do a show?  No, they tried to get me on her show, and of course, I would never do something like that.  Frank had it covered.  Yeah, Frank had it covered.  He would pound on her.  I mean, anything on HLN is, the whole entire purpose of HLN is that they can get away with 
[01:33:00]  more opinion.  Right.  You know, to spin what happens on CNN, and they cross, you know, use their, their, uh,  Promotion and stuff.  Yeah, their sound and whatever, and, um, so CNN can be officially news.  Yeah, CNN's news, but then HLN tries to use the CNN connection as legitimacy.  Sure.  So they're like, look at us.  Meanwhile, it's not news.  It's all this, uh, sensationalist opinion.  I like, uh, Nancy.  Speaking of that, we should get Jenny Hutt on the phone right now.  Oh, God.  She was, she's on that one with Dr. Drew. 
[01:33:30]  She's been hanging with Dr. Drew.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Can we get Jenny Hutt on real fast to ask her a question?  And, uh, I, we know her, and I would pound her about it.  It's like, what are you talking about?  You sound like an idiot up there when you, you're just going off with the same line that  everyone else is, uh, on the news is going off on.  Let's get her to ask a question.  Have some courage and look into things and, and say things that not everybody is saying, uh, because  it, you know, it does, it doesn't fit their little storyline here.  Emotion requires no critical examination of fact whatsoever. 
[01:34:00]  And it's so easy.  It's like a kid wants a gumball and you say, well, I don't have a quarter.  And the kid goes, I don't care.  I want the gumball.  You know, and that's what I feel now.  And I don't understand what that has to do with the quarter.  Excuse me, E-Rock, get him some gum.  Don't stop.  Yeah.  So if you have to examine fact and actually use your brain, you know, and actually come to a  conclusion that you might, your heart might not agree with and disagree with yourself  in that sense.  And it's, it's too much work.  It seems it's too much work to study, look into something, cross check something you  hear. 
[01:34:30]  I saw people retweeting things that were absolutely false and you know that they just see it and  assume, well, that's gotta be true.  Boom.  Retweet.  It's like, look into it.  We got Jenny Hutt on the line.  Jenny.  Jenny.  We got George's brother, Robert Zimmerman in studio.  And we figured, we figured you'd owe the whole family an apology.  So we'll start here.  Go.  Oh, I don't believe that.  Anyway.  What anyway?  You and Dr.  Drew.  I don't know anybody an apology. 
[01:35:00]  I think that I have to leave the verdict as is because that's the verdict.  And that's really, that's really how it ends.  You were saying things like, uh, well, um, I think, uh, George, uh, killed, uh, uh, an  innocent boy and without putting anything in context, hold on.  I do, I do still, I do still, I do still feel, still feel uncomfortable about the whole  thing.  That said, as I, I don't think anyone's comfortable with the whole thing.  I don't think that, that, that we have to respect the verdict. 
[01:35:30]  I do think that the prosecution did not present an adequate case and therefore George Zimmerman  was found.  Do you think they didn't present an adequate case because they didn't have an adequate  case?  There's a big difference.  I think we'll never really know exactly what happened because Trayvon Martin's dead.  Well, Jenny, let me ask you, what do you think?  And I have to, you know, and I, and I've argued with Anthony about this and I've taken  up in a way for the prosecution side, but, uh, what do you think they could have said  that they didn't?  I don't think that they just didn't have the evidence.  Well, I think it was beyond they're not having, listen, I think if you believe George 
[01:36:00]  Zimmerman's account, then I think not guilty was the right answer.  But it also jives with the evidence.  That's just, just that when people go, oh, it's only his word against the dead guy.  It's like, no, it has to drive with the evidence also.  Yeah.  No, but in truth, the evidence that, the way the evidence was, it was on the burden  of the prosecution to present enough evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt  that George Zimmerman was guilty of murder too.  The only job that the defense had was to prove reasonable doubt. 
[01:36:30]  And they went above and beyond and actually proved innocence.  It was an amazing job by the defense doing what the prosecution normally does.  They only needed reasonable doubt.  They proved what happened.  Hey guys, the defense did a terrific job.  I'm not going to, I will not say here or say on TV that the defense did anything but  a terrific job for their client.  But my position remains that it's a horrible tragedy.  I feel incredibly sad about the loss of this young life.  And I do think that George Zimmerman was somewhat quick to trigger. 
[01:37:00]  And that's how I feel.  Jenny, Robert, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Robert has a question for you though.  Robert has a question for you.  Jenny, I think I met you when I did, Dr. Drew.  I'm just...  Indeed you did, Robert.  I did.  How are you?  I'm curious about, you know, when people say the burden of proof is on the state.  I get that.  That's in every situation.  But do you think that this man, Chief Bill Lee, who has no job now because racism ruled 
[01:37:30]  the day and him and his entire department were smeared as racist by Ben Crump?  And do you think that Norm Wolfinger, who was, Ben Crump, wrote a letter to the Justice  Department saying that he had driven in the rain to decide and conspire with the racist  police chief not to charge George.  Do you think he wouldn't have wanted his job and every employee who worked for him?  And do you think that the entire federal Florida Department of Law Enforcement was corrupt  and also conspiring to...  This is what I think.  I don't...  This is what I think. 
[01:38:00]  I believe it was a valid prosecution.  I met your friend, Frank, a bunch of times on the TV show.  I don't believe it was a malicious prosecution.  I believe that there's now the Department of Justice making some sort of inquiry as to  whether there was a civil rights movement.  That'll never wash.  Never.  Listen, to me, I don't know that it'll wash either.  However, that's still going on.  And there is an aftermath in this whole event.  And in a way, I do have... 
[01:38:30]  Look, I do have compassion for your brother in that being...  Not being incarcerated.  He's not going to have much of a free life either at this point because society is somewhat  inflamed.  But it is what it is.  I mean, it's a hard strategy any way you look at it.  I understand all of that.  And that's your opinion.  And that's great.  But back to the actual question.  The actual question is, all of these people who the only thing they needed to set an arrest  in motion for anything was one shred or inkling of probable cause in any way, shape, 
[01:39:00]  or form.  And any one of those cops could have gone to his house and arrested him, and the entire  police department.  Do you really think that every one of those people was conspiring to not arrest George  for racist reasons the way it was presented in the media?  Do you really think that's the reality, that Chief Lee would rather be fired by the city  council?  By the way, that was not something that I looked into.  I really only looked at the actual...  Surprise, surprise.  I didn't care.  Oh, gee.  That requires looking into something. 
[01:39:30]  The point here is, this never should have gone to trial in the first place.  This man's life never...  By the way, I recognize being on your show this morning that there's no way that anyone's  going to really care about my perspective.  That's not true.  I think I've been...  Look, I've been kind of back and forth on this whole thing.  I'm trying to hear both sides.  Is that Jim?  Mr. Norton, but yes.  Yes, Jenny.  Jim, what do you think?  What, Ant?  What do you think, Jim?  I was...  I kind of had mixed feelings about it. 
[01:40:00]  Like, I didn't think he deserved murder, too.  He exhausted her.  But I wasn't comfortable with him being totally exonerated, either.  I felt that he pushed this...  That's where I feel.  But I know that I'm...  That's where I said that.  Legally, I don't think...  I don't think the prosecution...  I understand that.  And I don't think the prosecution dropped the ball.  I don't think the prosecution missed something.  I think the defense did a brilliant job.  Well, they hid the ball.  They hid evidence.  They hid reports in the phone logs.  They hid the picture of George that they had that proved how he was attacked.  Right, the bloody picture.  They never asked, not even in his bond hearing, to see his medical records. 
[01:40:30]  This is a person making statements to police.  My nose was broken.  My doctor will confirm it.  And a prosecutor doesn't even bother...  Listen, Robert, I will say, Robert...  I'm sorry, Jenny.  Are they going to pursue sanctions?  They talked about sanctions.  Are they going to go after them?  You know what?  Stay tuned.  Okay.  That's all I have to say about that.  Jenny, do you have a question for Robert?  No, I just was going to say...  What do you mean?  It's George's brother.  Yeah.  Any type of question.  What movie did George watch last night, now that he's free?  Anything.  Hey, Jenny.  Jenny, I got a...  It's George heavy-hearted. 
[01:41:00]  Robert, it's George heavy-hearted.  Is George heavy-hearted?  Does that mean he has a good heart?  No, is he heavy-hearted?  Sad.  That's a fat joke.  That's not nice.  Do you know what he said?  He's going to lose the weight now that the trial is over.  Why would you say that?  Knock it off.  Knock it off.  I would be only sensitive to those battling the ball.  What carcass are you guys looking over at HLN now?  What carcass are you circling?  It's hilarious has to be sentenced, so there's that carcass.  Okay, you got that carcass.  That's nice.  Oh, and the...  I think we're going to get into the Snyderman trial. 
[01:41:30]  She could have lived in my neighborhood.  What's the Snyderman trial?  You don't know, but you'll know in about 15 minutes after HLN.  Yes, after HLN.  It's a Jewish mother who's accused of hiring someone to kill her.  I can't wait for Nancy Grace to lube up the lens with that Vaseline and get back on camera.  And out to the lawyers.  Unleash the lawyers.  Release the hounds.  I wanted to say one thing to Robert.  Yes. 
[01:42:00]  Yes, sir.  I do think you are a much better spokesperson for your brother than Frank.  We've all said that.  Thanks.  Jenny, do you think...  Do you know Nancy Grace?  Put out on a limb on that one.  I don't know.  It's good cop, lunatic cop they're playing.  Do you like...  Do you think Nancy Grace does a good job?  I think Nancy...  I worked in the same ADA's office as Nancy Grace.  I've got a lot of stories about her.  Oh, boy.  Do any of them involve her wearing football helmet hair wigs?  Because she is revolting. 
[01:42:30]  She'll say John Lifkow.  I really hate her guts.  All right, I'm going to bow out.  All right.  She's got to protect that TV camera.  All right, Jenny.  Nice gig.  Take care.  Nice gig.  Thank you, Jenny.  All right.  Jenny hot, everyone.  We sort of love you.  Not pounding on Jenny, but it is a prime example of things that do happen in that type of media.  Well, I didn't really look into that.  I didn't look into that.  No kidding, man.  But what you're commenting on is based on that.  Right.  So she should look into the fact that the trial should never have taken place. 
[01:43:00]  He never should have been arrested.  The reason he was arrested...  Yeah, like you said, why would these people jeopardize their jobs, everything?  There's this giant conspiracy based on racism to not arrest him.  All they needed was one piece of evidence.  Anything.  Anything.  And they could have arrested him.  They just didn't find it.  And then they had to, you know, everybody gets all outraged.  They get this special prosecutor.  And it turns into a circus.  Right. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  And they fired the chief of police for that because...  And he can't get his job back now because there was a trial.  They said there was a basis for an arrest.  Again, it's like the Stephen Pagonis thing with Tawana Brawley.  It's, you know, a life ruined by collateral damage of false allegations.  Yeah, but thank God there are men and women...  There are men like him and men and women who actually honor their oath.  Unfortunately, it didn't work out so well for Chief Lee.  But he was getting really pressured.  And he was getting really encouraged by other people who take an oath to, you know, stand his ground and face the fire 
[01:44:00]  and not buckle to pressure because politics is supposed to stop where your oath begins.  Right.  And he's a prime example of that.  But, yeah, I mean, any cop that had any probable cause at any time could have said,  here it is, Chief.  We've got that.  And that's enough probable cause, you know, just for an arrest.  It's much easier to just chant, we want an arrest, than to have to think about something.  Yeah.  Because that's really easy to do.  Has anybody in your family, I know in court they separated, had any interaction with the Martin family at all? 
[01:44:30]  Just incidental or?  There was a friend of George's who claimed on the stand that Mr. Martin had said under his breath coming and going,  had called him, I think he said motherfucker.  I think that's what he told him when he saw him at the doors, because he saw that the name tag said family Zimmerman.  Oh, okay.  I'm not sure if you remember that, but that was kind of, that was right at the beginning when they were doing the rule of sequestration.  Right.  But no, we haven't had any courtroom interaction with them. 
[01:45:00]  I have had very limited interaction with, you know, Mr. Parks or seeing Mr. Crump or Natalie Jackson, something like that.  What would you say to Trayvon's mom?  I said it.  I said it in September of 2012.  I wrote out, with my family's help, a condolence statement.  And, you know, I was clear then and I'm clear now that it doesn't matter the circumstances surrounding loss of life.  Nobody is affected as much by Trayvon's death and his mother or his father. 
[01:45:30]  I mean, that goes without saying, I think.  Of course, yeah.  You know, and nobody should have to bury a child under any circumstances, you know.  I would now, they don't have to take advice from me, they probably don't even want to hear advice from me,  but I would just be real careful who might be exploiting your grief now for their own, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Gain.  That will happen.  And what is the time frame, sorry, for George with a civil trial with the Justice Department?  What is the, like, do they have to do it within six months or is there a, do they have forever to do it? 
[01:46:00]  Are we talking about the investigation?  See, that investigation was opened way a long time ago through the FBI into looking if there was any kind of racism involved or whatever.  And it went kind of, you know, simultaneously.  And sometimes they open federal investigations and don't resolve them on purpose.  So if the right thing doesn't happen, you know, in the state, then they go, wait a minute, you know, we still have this.  My understanding of that, you know, hate crime statute that they're trying to promote is that you act, I mean, it's very specific. 
[01:46:30]  There has to be a very specific protected, like gender or sex or, I mean, sex or race.  And you need to be acting under color of title, meaning you need to be a law enforcement officer.  Yeah, that's why the police out there.  That's one aspect of it.  That's one aspect of it.  Yeah, if you're not.  The other one is based on total racism.  Right.  I mean, you have to be, you know, KKK or, you know, just something just outlandish.  And, I mean, there's no evidence of that here. 
[01:47:00]  Right, right.  Yeah, so that's, you know, I don't know.  I guess it'll have to run its course and then be closed whenever.  When is he, like, will he eventually go out and do press or do, I'm sure he wants to talk.  It's got to be very frustrating.  Because I would much, I would really, you know, as much as I've had feelings about the case,  sometimes if you talk to somebody and you can ask specific questions.  I know he gave his statements, but it's like, you know, you get to talk to somebody and ask him questions.  It makes you see things a little bit differently, but for legal reasons, he probably can't.  Yeah, he hasn't expressed that he does, and we don't try to get him to. 
[01:47:30]  Like, we don't go and pitch this person or that person or Nancy Grace or whoever.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  He should agree to do Nancy Grace, then just not show up.  Because it would annoy her so much.  It would really annoy her.  That'd be great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I mean, I think that he will recover first and then worry about anything out here  in this kind of periphery of the public realm, but he has a lot of work to do himself.  Anybody would in that situation.  Yeah, yeah.  So when you guys are in hiding, like, how do you pay your bills? 
[01:48:00]  I had a lot of money saved, and that's how I pay my bills.  Like, everyone's trying to fine you guys, but, you know, you still got to pay your bills.  Right, yeah.  How does all that work?  I'm fascinated by the...  You do everything online.  And if you ever need to go in hiding, I'd be a great consultant.  Okay.  Maybe that's why I'm asking.  Yeah.  I just find it amazing that no one was able to find any family member where they were hiding.  I just find that really amazing in this day and age.  It's good.  No, I don't...  I know. 
[01:48:30]  I don't want them to find your family.  I'm just amazed that it just never happened.  It is so easy to track people these days with your computer.  It is very impressive that you are, like, you know...  Extremely impressive.  Are you just living out of a suitcase?  No, no, no.  We have, you know, a home.  When I'm here, yeah, I'm living out of a suitcase.  Right.  But we always have, like, a bag, a take-and-evacuate bag, just in case...  Yeah, the go bag.  Yeah, exactly.  We have that ready.  But Jesse Ventura, he's off the grid.  I'm going to Mexico. 
[01:49:00]  You know what George is going to have to deal with for the rest of his life?  Not even just the threat of death or bodily harm.  It's just remarks and comments and people saying things.  It's about, like, any restaurant you're ever in, someone yelling at you.  Right, right.  Just the stuff that just makes life very, very unpleasant.  Yeah, and it's not always the bad stuff.  It could be, you know...  I hear a lot of good stuff about George all the time.  And I was actually with George's wife one time.  He's married?  Yeah.  He knows how much I know.  I didn't even know he was married.  Yeah, she was in the court. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, and I was with his wife.  And I'm not worried about if people engage me or ask me,  are you that guy or whatever?  And I say, I don't know what guy.  I don't have a TV.  And just kind of see what they know.  But I was with his wife.  And we ran into a person who was a very...  Actually, a former roommate of George's.  Oh, wow.  And he starts kind of shouting, like,  Oh, my God, I can't believe what they did to George.  Tell George I love him and this and that.  So it's not like everyone will be bad.  But you might be with a friend and there's foes around. 
[01:50:00]  You know, and then they blow your cover.  Yeah, yeah.  So that he's going to have to deal with, too.  Shut up.  Right, yeah.  It's too late here.  Just fucking wink and give me the okay sign.  Yeah, yeah.  High sign.  Okie dokie.  So what do you do after this?  What is the rest of your day and the rest of your week and all that?  Tomorrow, I'm sorry, tonight I'll be doing Greta Van Susteren.  And tomorrow I'll be in America's Newsroom with Bill Hemmer.  America's Newsroom.  That sounds impressive.  America's Newsroom.  America's Newsroom.  With Bill Hemmer.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I've met Bill and went on his program before, and I look forward to doing it again 
[01:50:30]  and then just kind of bowing out for...  There's really not much more you can say about the acquittal.  I certainly don't want to give the impression that we're gloating or celebrating.  Right.  I think it's important to contextualize what happened and to start to make sense out of it.  But I need to be with my family, and I need to get my ducks in a row in terms of employment,  things like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think this will hurt what you were doing professionally before? 
[01:51:00]  I don't see how you could...  The thing about music is, you know, what makes the artist is the art.  That's what we all want to believe.  But I think that people will hear, if I write an essay and it's authored by me, they're already  going to come with an opinion, you know, when they read it.  So if I sing a song, you know, and it's sung by me, I'm George Zimmerman's brother doing  it, you know, and that's how it would be evaluated.  So that kind of sucks when you have to be so focused on music to just have it not really  appreciated, because it's looked through that perspective. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  I got a couple tweets here.  Tina Vane, also known as Tina Cracker Vane, she writes, Robert, whatever you do, done,  be politically correct state interracial crime stats.  What?  That's exactly how she tweeted that.  Twitter is an amazing thing, isn't it?  Robert, whatever you do, done, be politically correct state interracial crime stats.  And then we got this one from Rob Biccio. 
[01:52:00]  This conversation is a little one-sided.  He still killed a teenager that would have done nothing if not followed.  Well, I think six people said he died.  Well, he did kill a teenager, but they said he's not what he was justified in doing such.  Yeah.  And then someone said that that neighborhood has, you know, more crime than Compton.  Like, someone actually broke down the crime stats.  I wish someone would really.  Yeah, I wish somebody really would.  I mean, I can't...  I'm trying to find it. 
[01:52:30]  I don't know if this is true, but Steroid Opie on Twitter writes, Compton, California,  29 robberies per thousand.  Sanford, Florida, 60 robberies per thousand.  Oh, Sanford is bad.  Yeah.  I'm just talking about, like, that neighborhood.  I can't imagine.  I mean, 400 phone calls in 12 months for 200 homes is like, you yourself called the police  twice in a year.  Yeah, yeah.  No matter who's in there.  I called the police, like, twice growing up.  Yeah.  You know, in, like, 18 years.  Right.  And I just can't even imagine in that density, you know, it's not like a sprawling area. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's very small, actually.  You'll look at the map of it.  Have you had to block anyone on Twitter?  You and, like, Spike Lee or something like that?  Oh, my God.  I've had to block some people.  Would you like to just, like, would you like to talk to certain, like, celebrities that  have been, like, overtly, he's a murderer and he should be killed.  Would you like to discuss this with these people or would they be unwilling to talk this  out with you?  No, I don't think so. 
[01:53:30]  I've always been willing to take calls or, you know, on radio or take any question on  television.  And I know that those kind of people are listening, but, you know, celebrities, they're performers  and performance is based on a rousing emotion.  It's not, they're not attorneys who inform a fact.  They don't want to think a lot sometimes and they just want, they like to be popular  and it's really popular to chant things like hope and change and arrest.  You know, it's easy.  And that's what, that's what they do.  They're, they're performers and they're performing. 
[01:54:00]  Now, we, um, we got Judge Alex on the line.  Should we take a break?  What should we do?  Oh, man.  We've been at it for two hours here.  Actually, uh.  Let me see if he can.  Grab Judge Alex.  What?  Should we grab Judge Alex?  I would like to have him on, uh, the same time, you know.  You want to just continue?  Yeah, let's go.  Why not?  Judge Alex, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  So, hey guys.  How was it?  I got to ask a question from over the weekend.  How was it drinking with Anthony Cumia?  Well, the good part was, was drinking. 
[01:54:30]  That was, that's the best part.  He says you're a responsible drinker, though.  Of course.  No, I am.  I actually, I am.  I have, I have a two drink rule.  I cut myself off after two drinks.  Yeah.  I can only imagine what happens if you take that third.  That means there's been problems in the past where you're like, okay, I gotta stick to two.  He was, uh.  No, you know what it is?  If, uh, if you guys get it, well, not you guys.  You guys would be in the same boat I'm in.  But, you know, if everybody out there, they get a DUI, their family's embarrassed. 
[01:55:00]  If you and I get a DUI, we're in every paper.  Yeah, exactly.  Never mind the fact that you could actually kill somebody.  I mean, that's not really the overriding thing.  But, but, you know, you're, when you're in the spotlight, your behavior is really watched.  And you just have to be careful.  Yeah.  Well, uh, Judge Alex, uh.  That being said, being with Anthony required me to drink heavily.  Yeah, it's indeed.  We, uh, we have Robert Zimmerman here with us.  Um, and, uh, what, what, what's your take on, uh, on the verdict?  Just a little, uh. 
[01:55:30]  I think it's, uh, as I said, I think when I was with you guys, I said the same thing.  I think that, uh, it's the only lawful verdict the jury could have brought back.  Uh, it's, it's a tragic case.  There's no question about it.  And I was, I was listening to the story about the tweets that the Martins have, uh, have  put out, you know, asking for call and talking about how their heart's broken and all that.  And I, and I have to say, number one, uh, so emotional to hear, hear them expressing  their, their feelings that way.  And, and on top of that, um, I don't know that if I were in the same situation, I could 
[01:56:00]  have the strength and the class that they have shown in this, in the tragedy throughout.  Um, and that being said, the justice system requires certain things.  It requires a certain level of evidence that the prosecution simply didn't have.  They don't have it.  They, they cannot rebut, uh, uh, George Zimmerman's claim of self-defense beyond every reasonable  doubt.  In fact, there was substantial evidence of self-defense there.  Yeah.  Uh, and yes, I think we all would agree.  We wish George had never left the car.  We wish he had not, uh, been in any contact with Trayvon Martin. 
[01:56:30]  Uh, we wish all of that.  Uh, and this would never have happened, but since that did happen, the prosecutors have  to look at the evidence.  They have to make a decision.  They do it every day.  The cases like this, unfortunately are not rare.  There are many, there are many cases where a person is killed and the only witness is the  person who killed them.  And there is no video camera and there are no neighbors who, who, who, uh, saw anything.  And the forensic evidence is not conclusive as to one version or the other.  And in those cases, the state attorney has a very difficult conversation with the family 
[01:57:00]  of the victims and says, we're sorry.  We are deeply sorry.  We would love to have evidence to prosecute in this case, but we don't.  And we are obligated by our ethical obligation not to bring a case that we cannot prove beyond  every reasonable doubt.  They have this conversation every day across this country with victims.  In this case, they clearly knew they did not have enough evidence to reach beyond a reasonable  doubt.  Judge Alex, good morning.  I was wondering about your perspective. 
[01:57:30]  If you saw the, uh, the press conference where Ms. Corey announced, uh, that her, uh,  her role or her mission as a prosecutor and what your thoughts are were to seek justice specifically  for Trayvon and that her first order of business was to pray with, uh, quote, those sweet,  sweet parents.  Is it appropriate for a governor to send a, a prayer leader, uh, to, is that a part of  any prosecutor's oath that you're supposed to pray with people who you assume you're  seeking justice for, or are prosecutors supposed to seek justice for society generally? 
[01:58:00]  Uh, they're supposed to seek justice for society generally.  And, and, uh, you know, when we saw that, when we saw that on television, I was a little  surprised.  There is no problem with the state attorney feeling sympathy for the family of the victim  and expressing that.  The problem I think is if you take a look at the entire circumstance of this case, when  it happened, when, when the shooting happened, the first thing was, I wonder if this is racism.  I wonder if this was race motivated.  I have no problem with that.  I think that if you have an older man who shoots a young boy and the older man's white 
[01:58:30]  and the young boy's black, it would be ridiculous for people to not say, I wonder if racism is  involved here, that this is, this is just outrageous the way it looks.  However, because, uh, because, because to ignore that, obviously it's to ignore that racism  does exist.  So, however, once you're investigating and the investigation reveals that they're, that  this is not race motivated.  And, and I think the investigation clearly revealed that.  In fact, the FBI launched its own investigation because of the public outcry and interviewed 
[01:59:00]  witnesses and interviewed people in New Georgia, all this stuff.  And they issued a report saying there is no evidence of racism here.  The state attorneys in court made that statement.  Now, while they were making that statement, on the one hand, I think with the left hand,  they were trying to imply racism.  And it was very apparent to me.  And I think it was very apparent to a lot of people who, who work in the legal field and  were watching this.  So the media took that initial impression of racism and it appears to be ran with it like 
[01:59:30]  a train.  Did the media act with incompetence because of that?  Should there be some kind of standard?  I mean, these people, Mr. Mr. Crump and Ms. Jackson, they had a financial interest in  the outcome of how this case or my brother would be perceived.  And they, they had a script and they sold it.  Is that competent journalism to take the word for people as soon as they drop racism on the  table who want you to believe that it's racism as fact and then to report it as fact?  Well, I don't, I don't really have much faith in the media anymore. 
[02:00:00]  I mean, I lost my faith in the media many years ago.  So I don't, I don't, I take things I hear in the media with a grain of salt.  I am not one of those who subscribes to one TV station or one network and says everybody  else is something is whatever, because I just, I just feel like the media in today's day and  age twists too many facts for their own benefit.  And so I'll, I'll watch several different networks and I don't necessarily believe all  that one of them says or any of the thing that one of them says. 
[02:00:30]  I just watch it to, to get the different perspectives.  And what I think they did was they had a viewpoint that they wanted to sell to the public.  And we are becoming with the media more and more every day, they're puppets and they,  they play what they want to play.  They air what they want to air.  And there was, there was one major network that, that actually edited the call from George  where he said, I'm watching somebody who's suspicious.  We had a lot of break-ins in the area and they asked him what's suspicious about him.  And he said, well, he's, you know, he's walking in the dark and the rain between houses at 
[02:01:00]  night and looks like he's checking them out.  And they said, is he black, white, or Hispanic?  And he said, well, he's black.  And they cut all that out and they aired it.  This is a national, this is a major network.  And they aired it to say, hi, I'm watching the suspicious guy in my neighborhood.  And we had a lot of birdways.  Oh, what's suspicious about him?  He's black.  He's black.  He's wearing a hoodie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to tag that too.  Hold on, hold on, Judge Alex.  I want to tag that because it goes to your point.  And then they get caught doing that.  And the apology is kind of on the back pages. 
[02:01:30]  So most people don't even realize that, you know, that was done.  And that's what bothers me too, is that not only was the apology in the back page,  the apology, number two, made no sense.  The apology was, oh, well, we had something to the effect of, well, that was an intern.  Like a major network would live.  Yeah, yeah.  Edit a tape and then put it on the air with nobody checking it.  And then on top of that, it wasn't carried.  I mean, you'd think that the networks, the other networks would say, oh my God,  I can't believe this major network falsified a tape. 
[02:02:00]  And I still, when I mention that, people look at me and go, are you serious?  And I'm thinking, how could you not have heard that?  So there was this script of racism, even though the investigation revealed that this was not race-based.  I mean, it was race-based to an extent.  Let me say that.  Okay, because if you have a lot of burglaries in an area, and the burglaries are committed by young black males,  teenage black males, and you see a young teenage black male coming between houses in the night, in the rain, 
[02:02:30]  and he looks out of place, you don't recognize him, that is a factor in the description.  That is not racism.  Racism is you see a black male and you go, oh, I better watch him.  He must be up to no good.  But if he fits a description of people who are committing crimes in the area, it is a factor to take into account.  If it would have been burglaries committed by Hispanic males, and there's a Hispanic male coming between the houses,  it is a factor in the description. 
[02:03:00]  Just like if it was burglaries committed by guys with long brown hair, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  That is a factor.  Now, the suspicion that maybe this was, well, he doesn't like black males and he's racially profiling,  that's a fair concern, but that concern was completely disproved to the local police and to the FBI.  Yet, I think, even throughout the trial, the state attorney's office, and even at the end, in her speech,  which I found a little disturbing in Angela Corey's speech, it was still more of the same. 
[02:03:30]  And I think that there probably needs to be an investigation into how and why this case was pursued beyond the point  when they clearly knew they could not prove the case.  And when they had a grand jury impaneled and they were, you know, able to avail themselves of the grand jury  and just kind of sidestep that, that was bizarre.  Yeah, absolutely.  And for your audience's benefit, the reason that that's important, Robert makes a good point there. 
[02:04:00]  I don't think I've actually ever met Robert, but I've seen him on some interviews, and he makes a good point there.  If you give the investigation to the grand jury and they come back with an indictment or an information,  well, okay, fine, you presented it and they made the decision, you go forward.  So state attorneys do this all the time.  And some people suggest maybe she didn't do that because she was given the marching orders to prosecute this case  so that we don't have any rioting and so we don't have any civil unrest. 
[02:04:30]  And if she gave it to the grand jury, they might not indict.  They probably wouldn't have come back with a true bill.  And so she wouldn't be able to prosecute it.  So the argument there that's being made is she purposely sidestepped the grand jury so she could proceed with the prosecution that she was told to make.  The bad part about that is that if that was the motivation, and I am very suspicious by nature when something like this happens,  if that is the motivation, then they went forward and avoided civil unrest because there was a high risk of it back then. 
[02:05:00]  You remember with Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and everybody.  Those guys were a race of civil unrest going on.  So they avoided civil unrest in the state of Florida by charging somebody that they knew they could not prove the crime against.  And now at the end of the day, they don't really get much civil unrest because, first of all, time has passed.  Secondly, the evidence was put out there and it's them getting up there and saying, look, we have this evidence. 
[02:05:30]  It is not enough for these reasons.  They put on the trial and let everybody see that they had a weak case and let the jury come back with a not guilty.  And then they stand up there and said, well, we tried.  And the downside to that is you sacrificed George Zimmerman for your own gain to avoid civil unrest and all that.  You now have marked him because you have basically put the official stamp of the state attorney on it saying this is a legitimate prosecution. 
[02:06:00]  And that's going to result in civil unrest.  I think they're going to be sued as well.  Wait, does that hurt George?  As attorneys, you have an ethical obligation not to do that.  Judge Alex, do you think that the Florida State Bar should investigate Angela Curry and the other prosecutors?  I think that they probably will have some complaints.  If they have complaints, they will have to investigate.  I think the bigger investigation really needs to be.  And I hate to say this, by the way, because I am a huge, huge fan of state attorneys and public defenders. 
[02:06:30]  I think that state attorneys, public defenders, police officers, teachers give more to our community than they, I mean, by far, than they are compensated for.  But, you know, when I see something like this, there were those allegations of withholding of evidence and material that should have been turned over to the defense.  It appeared from the allegations, and I guess we'll have to wait and see if they're true, that they were intentionally done.  And there was an employee, a whistleblower from the state attorney's office, who basically, according to him, caught them hiding evidence from the defense. 
[02:07:00]  And they threw his ass out of there, too.  Do you think, like you said for George Zimmerman, does it in a way work out to his advantage that all this has gotten out there, though?  Like, if they didn't prosecute, even though maybe they shouldn't have, if they didn't, it looks like this whole big cover-up thing, and people are still talking about him.  At least this, it looks like it's gone through the process, and he was legally acquitted.  Does this work out better for him in the long run, just as a man? 
[02:07:30]  Well, I mean, honestly, I can't say it works out better for him, because, first of all, there's a difference between the state attorney getting up there and saying,  Look, I'm sorry, we don't have enough evidence. The evidence that we have is insufficient to prosecute.  He's claiming self-defense. The evidence tends to support self-defense.  We know that there may be evidence that disputes it in some respect, but there really isn't enough evidence to prosecute.  There would have been anger, and then it would have gone away.  Now what you had was a trial that every day was raising people's expectations. 
[02:08:00]  You know, people are thinking, well, you know, the prosecutor took it. It must be a good case.  It legitimized something that was illegitimate.  Yeah, and that kind of conviction.  Right, and going off of Jim's question, do you think the public would have been better served by having a consistent message from an appointed official like that,  that kind of reinforced that all of the people in the police department were acting ethically,  the state attorney's office was acting ethically, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement was acting ethically,  or do you think now, because these expectations were raised, that the next George Zimmerman or whatever that happens in Sanford, 
[02:08:30]  the public was not as well served by this entire process?  Where is the public trust now?  You know, I don't know.  I don't know if the public is going to distrust the state attorney's office in Sanford,  because this was not the state attorney's office in Sanford.  I mean, you'll remember that the police and the state attorneys looked at this,  and the suggestion was, oh, they're just whitewashing this. 
[02:09:00]  They didn't do any investigation.  They basically don't want to prosecute him, because he's a Hispanic male.  I keep being corrected.  I keep saying he's white.  And Trayvon is a black male and all this.  Well, you know, what we're seeing now from the evidence is apparently they did a thorough investigation.  Apparently they did consider it thoroughly, and they decided they did not have enough.  It looks like they did exactly what prosecutors are ethically required to do.  And then all of a sudden, whoever made the decision, and I have no idea who it is, 
[02:09:30]  somebody made the decision, let's send down this other prosecutor and let them go at it and take this to trial.  And that is where I have an idea.  And in essence, overruled.  So it kind of legitimized what Mr. Crump was alleging, that the public should not trust these agencies,  because they were conspiring for racist reasons to sweep the murder of a black child under the rug,  as he put it to Piers Morgan.  Didn't it legitimize?  I mean, didn't the public trust suffer because this politician came to overrule their, 
[02:10:00]  and what we know were ethical leaders honoring their oath?  Well, I think the trust, I think they cast aspersions on the state attorney and the police officers in Sanford County.  And I think that reasonable people who watched the trial realized that that was a shell game,  that the state attorneys in Sanford and Seminole County and that the police officers who investigated this,  they did what they could.  I mean, they did what they could.  They investigated it.  They tried to shake George. 
[02:10:30]  You know, they did that interrogation where they said,  Hey, you know what?  We think we might have a video of this.  Trayvon could have been filming it, or there are a lot of neighbors there.  And he didn't shake.  I mean, when I listened to all the evidence, I said they had no case.  They had no case from the beginning.  And it doesn't mean that you have to like the outcome.  It doesn't mean that you, that, you know, I mean, I think reasonable people out there,  because there are a lot of unreasonable people.  There are some people who will never, ever see racism.  There are some people out there who are like,  Oh, my God, every time somebody claims racism, I'm beside myself. 
[02:11:00]  And there are some people on the other side who always see racism.  And I tend to understand more the people who always see racism,  because if you were living in a community where you are a minority,  and let's say, you know, serial killers.  Serial killers tend to be predominantly white males or sexual molesters,  middle-aged white males predominantly.  And if there was a sexual molester going around and you were constantly being viewed that way,  when you walked around, people would look at you like kind of, 
[02:11:30]  I wonder if this guy's a sexual molester.  That would really, really get you.  Now, imagine it was happening not just because there was a sexual molester running around.  Imagine it was happening your whole life from the time you were born.  People were looking at you that way.  So I understand the people who tend to feel like racism is everywhere,  but I think that they've got to realize it's not.  It's not everywhere.  And if you claim it's everywhere, then the times when it really, really is racism,  people will tend to be desensitized and will not believe you. 
[02:12:00]  And on the other side, you know, there are the extremists on the other side who believe it's never racism.  But most of America, I believe, is in the middle and recognizes that some people have racist tendencies  and act on them and some people don't.  And they listen fairly to the case and they make up their own minds.  The big issue I have is when some powerful entity like the media or like a state attorney takes it  and tries to snow the public and tries to make them believe their agenda or their version of it.  And that's unfortunately what I think happened to some extent in this case. 
[02:12:30]  Tragic as the case was, regardless, it was not a case of racism.  No, I don't think they're going to be able to get with that civil rights investigation.  I don't think that's going to go anywhere.  Yeah, and I don't think we can afford to cry wolf with racism.  Right, yes.  We're debasing the whole argument for when it actually is there, which it is abhorrent.  But crying wolf doesn't know.  The word is becoming nothing because it's just being used for every little disagreement on a black-white issue. 
[02:13:00]  The word racism comes out when you're just trying to have a civil dialogue about something.  Well, I mean, look at it in this case.  I mean, I tweeted on both sides here.  I tweeted about things that, you know, there are things in George's story that I just don't believe.  Like what, Judge Alex?  Yes.  An example.  Okay.  With respect to George getting out of the car to go look at a street sign. 
[02:13:30]  I don't believe that.  I think George got out of the car to see where Trayvon went because he thought Trayvon was up to no gut.  And maybe he felt that, oh, you know what?  Maybe this dispatcher told me he didn't need me to follow him, and then I was still looking to see where he went.  And maybe I'm getting in trouble for that.  And I think, and this is just my opinion, you know, I may be completely wrong, but I'm telling you some of the evidence I saw and everything.  I think that he made up the, oh, I went to look at the street sign because he wanted to not say I was looking to see where he was. 
[02:14:00]  And by the way, I think the evidence also supports, clearly supports in my mind, that Trayvon is the one who reports George.  And people will disagree with me on that, but I think that Gene Tell's testimony established that pretty clearly in my mind.  But that being said, that's just my opinion.  But I think, and it doesn't make his act illegal.  I mean, you know, if I see somebody coming out of my neighbor's house, I'm going to call the police and say, hey, you know, my neighbor's not home.  And I see this guy, and I think he might be up to no good.  Well, he might not be up to no good, but I think that. 
[02:14:30]  I may follow him.  They may tell me don't follow him.  I may still follow him.  They're telling me that because they don't want me to get hurt.  But I'm not violating the law.  I can walk up to him and say, what are you doing here?  I'm not violating the law.  But for whatever reason, he didn't, or maybe he didn't know that he could legally do that.  And he, I think, made up the story.  Well, when I tweet that, I get responses from people like, oh, you're part of the train that wants a railroad George, and you're part of it.  And if I tweet something that I think, like, for example, our conversation now that I think, that legally this prosecution should not have been brought,  because they have an ethical obligation not to bring a case they can't prove, 
[02:15:00]  I will get tweets from people on the other side who said, you're such a racist.  You know, you can't win if you're trying to be fair.  You can't win because one side and the other side will disagree with you.  If you just pick a side and say, I'm going to run with it, and you just shut out the other side and say, you know,  you know, George is being railroaded, then at least you've got those people who are going to side with you.  Well, I mean, that's the only way I do things.  I call them as I see them.  Well, Judge Alex, thanks for the call. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you very much.  Very informative, of course, as usual.  Were you amazed how much Anthony could drink?  I need to know.  I need to know, Judge Alex.  I was having a little wine, and I wasn't drinking very fast.  Did it strike you as odd he had one straw in yours as well as his own?  He was siphoning it.  Did you have to hold your drink with two hands because you felt like he was going to grab it at any moment and chug it down?  Smart asses.  Yeah, that'll teach him to go drinking with me again.  Yeah, great. 
[02:16:00]  All right, Judge Alex.  Thank you, Judge Alex.  Good talking to you guys.  Yeah, right on.  There he goes.  And Robert, one more tweet.  Just trying to keep it fair.  I wonder if protocols are going to change, like 911 protocols.  Yeah, right?  You know, and saying, like, which way did he go?  And then you hear the door chime and the door open.  Now it's like, what should I say?  Without following him, tell me where he went.  Interesting tweet from this guy, Steve.  Yes.  Whatever.  His name is too fucked up. 
[02:16:30]  Steve-O.  He writes, brother just got off on murder charges and he's on a media tour, huh?  Question mark.  Disgraceful is the hashtag.  You want to address that?  You know, it is what it is.  I don't.  I think you're out there sticking up for your brother.  I think that's how I see it.  Yeah.  And your brother can't really talk right now.  Sorry.  No, no.  You're right.  And neither my mom and dad are not doing that right now.  They will speak out eventually and contextualize what it has meant for our family, how we disappeared 
[02:17:00]  from the face of the earth.  And what this, there are no winners, but it is a legal victory in the sense that George  was exonerated what that means for us.  And, you know, if they don't disagree, I don't know if that guy's a brother.  And to be honest, Robert was out talking before the trial, too.  It wasn't like, oh, wow, an acquittal, let me get out there and start, you know, you've  been a strong advocate for your brother.  How could anybody not see that?  I read the tweet because I know people are thinking that. 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  So I just wanted you to have a chance to address that.  Yeah, a guy going out and kind of fighting the media machine, I hate to say it like that,  but there really is, there's nothing wrong with that.  Because they really do have one kind of collective voice, and you have to go out and give your  point and give it loudly and often.  Do you at some point just go into a closed room and scream at the top of your lungs?  Because you're very mild-mannered on the shows, and there's got to be a point where  you're just like, God, I'd like to scream at you.  No. 
[02:18:00]  Not you, Jimmy.  No, I, you know, those, like, sometimes when I leave certain shows, I do, you know, think,  I just think, I don't know, you kind of have to put everything aside to just deal with that.  And you have to remember, I mean, you guys are very chill, but some of these people have  these outlandish egos, and they think that they are, you know.  Oh, Jimmy.  They just came right down the top of Olympus.  I ooze humility.  I actually was voted boy most likely to say something humble in high school. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, wow.  Well, why don't we, I guess, wrap up?  God, man, it's just great to have you on.  You give a great perspective from being so close to the family.  It's, you've been a pleasure to watch on television, too.  Thanks.  Very concise.  Very articulate.  I like that you put things in perspective.  And obviously, look, you're closer to that side of the story, but you're very educated  as to what this whole thing has been about. 
[02:19:00]  So, you know, if I watch somebody else from the prosecution side or from Trayvon's family,  it's going to be different.  But you've done just such a great job of defending your brother, and that's so very noble.  And was George able to see Grown Ups 2 over the weekend?  I have no idea.  Did you see Sharknado?  No, no, I didn't.  You guys didn't get to see Sharknado?  See, there is an injustice.  I think that is the injustice.  Worst movie you'll ever see on Sci-Fi Channel. 
[02:19:30]  Catch it.  Oh, but everyone watched.  Well, everyone tweeted about it.  We had a little something to do with that.  About 1.7 million watched it.  Wow.  Which is good for Sci-Fi.  That's huge for Sci-Fi.  Okay, so not everyone was watching, but that's still a big number for that.  All right, let's eat.  Again, thanks.  Thank you for having me.  And your helicopter's waiting for you on the roof.  Excellent.  Good luck to you.  We'll be back after an hour break.  By the way, I want to ask Robert one thing.  When you saw Roland Campos, did you go, George?  Oh, God.  Did you know Roland? 
[02:20:00]  I didn't see him today.  Oh, Roland.  And I want to thank Bob Dylan for being on the phone for the last two and a half hours.  Yes, excellent job, Chris.  Thank you, Bob Dylan.  Well, can I get a plug-in?  Sure.  Yeah.  My law firm's website is cjplaw.com, and my Twitter is atosquire1973.  All right.  You got one thing to say before you hang up.  Do you know what it is? 
[02:20:30]  Don't disappoint me.  Don't disappoint me.  That was slobber.  The OPNF Show.  A lot of what you do.  On Sirius XM.  And now, back to The OPN Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  I want to thank Robert Zimmerman for stopping on by today. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  He's great.  So you like the face of the Twitter voice?  That's exactly what I pictured it looking like.  Good.  Good.  I hope it becomes a thing.  I tweeted, the voice is called, now the Twitter voice has a face.  I just tweeted that.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Enjoy it.  Use it.  Do.  To your own benefit.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  Anthony Cumia on Twitter.  Jim Norton on Twitter.  Yes.  You addressed this guy and he still doesn't get it.  Steve.  He's promoting himself on this.  Now you know why America hates the Zimmerman.  He's not promoting himself, Steve.  What is he promoting?  Opie read your tweet.  Yeah.  Robert explains.  He's not promoting himself.  What did he promote from himself that will advance him in any way?  I could see him going on TV a lot in the future. 
[02:22:00]  I was just talking to him on the way out.  I'm like, you know, you obviously are very good at this, you know, because you went on  all these shows and everyone was trying to get you to yell and scream and you kept your  emotions in check.  He's very articulate.  And I could see after some time goes by that he actually could be on TV, you know, talking  about other cases.  He could be certainly an advocate out there.  Look at Mark Furman.  Mark Furman was the scourge of society during the OJ trial. 
[02:22:30]  And now he's, you know, he's one of these pundit talking head guys.  He was also a cop, though.  Like, Furman was like a detective and he had a big background before that one moment.  Yep.  Um, George doesn't really have a background in any of this stuff.  No, but he's, he's good at what he does.  So, uh, or, uh, Robert is good at what he does, uh, as far as, uh, interviews and whatnot.  Yeah.  So, um, really fast.  This happened, uh, last week.  Um, remember how we talked about creepy kids and then the phones were lit? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Didn't we have that, like, website with all, like, all the creepy shit kids out there?  Yeah, yeah.  People have, uh, written what their kids do.  It's like, who's that behind you?  Right.  And you turn around and there's no one there.  It's like, what are you, creepy little fuck?  What are you doing to me?  Or you ask them, you know, who you're playing with?  And it's a dead relative.  They never met.  Yeah, yeah.  We did about an hour, hour and a half on this shit.  And at the time I said, oh, I'm lucky.  I, I haven't had any of this shit happen.  Yeah.  Last week, I took Friday off. 
[02:23:30]  So I think it was, maybe it was Thursday night or Wednesday, whatever.  Uh, uh, my, my son's sleeping with us.  He pops up out of bed, middle of the night.  Actually, I was in the other room to get a good night's sleep.  So it was just me and him.  He came in and, um, slept with me and, um, he pops his head up, sits straight up in bed,  stares at the fucking door.  I'm like, he goes, daddy.  And he said something like, what is that man doing with the ice cream? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, man.  Middle of the night shit where your brain's not fucking fully functioning.  So even an adult gets a little weird, right?  Must have been dreaming.  Obviously.  But then he pops back down and falls back to sleep immediately.  And now I'm wide awake looking at the door the rest of the night.  Fucking ice cream guy.  Ice cream guy.  That's the creepiest shit.  Ice cream guy.  But didn't it occur to you that you have doormat insecurity and that no man would have come 
[02:24:30]  all the way up and then eaten ice cream in your house?  Could have scaled the outside of the building and cut it with a glass cutter.  You know what you mean when it's a bright, sunny day?  All that logic makes sense.  But it's the middle of the night and you're woken up.  You're a little scaredy cat.  What's that man doing with the ice cream?  Something like that.  You know, because I was half asleep.  What would you do if you saw a popsicle stick in the morning?  Oh, my God.  I would have had a heart attack.  But he falls back asleep and now I'm like, I could not go back to sleep.  I'm just convinced now that there's someone at the bedroom door just staring at us sleeping. 
[02:25:00]  Some kind of ghostly figure.  Okay, this coming in.  Was it Spuds Buckley with a fudgy wudgy fuck?  But there you go.  There you go.  No, because you're going to say, what is that ass doing with the ice cream?  Oh, my God.  Thank God there's not much audio of Spuds Buckley.  Oh, there's plenty.  That's scary.  It was fucking...  Yee.  And I thought I was lucky.  No creepy shit.  And it finally happened, man. 
[02:25:30]  What...  I don't know exactly.  But it was something like, what is that man doing with the ice cream?  Why won't that man give me some ice cream?  Something.  Something with ice cream.  And I know where it came from because he was trying to get ice cream before he went to bed.  And we're like, no fucking way are we dealing with a sugar high when he should be going to bed.  Kid dreams are hilarious.  He just wanted ice cream.  So he goes to sleep thinking of ice cream.  Dreams of ice cream.  Ice cream.  Pops his head up.  I want ice cream.  But stared right at the bedroom door.  Yeah.  And then pops back down like it was nothing. 
[02:26:00]  And I'm like...  Thanks.  Imagine if he was writing it backwards in the air.  Ice cream.  Ice cream.  Ice cream.  We got a guy that was...  I mean, we've done this...  Here's a guy.  We'll take this call.  Bill in Pennsylvania.  Go ahead.  Well, Bill.  Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm calling from the other perspective.  I don't have kids yet, although I do find them creepy.  But when I was a kid, my parents made me go to therapy for almost two years because they 
[02:26:30]  said I was making threats to them and talking to people that weren't there.  I don't remember any of it other than being, like, asleep, like you said.  But apparently, I said there were people coming to the house and in the house that were going  to kill them and take them away.  Jesus.  What?  Well, there weren't.  There weren't, obviously.  But, I mean, you know, it terrified them enough and, you know, I apparently would just  shout random stuff, random times, like a five or six-year-old.  Right.  You little ghoul. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  But, all right.  Well, aren't you a delight?  Yeah, no kidding.  It is what it is.  Thanks, gentlemen.  Thanks, Bill.  Yeah, bye.  So, it finally happened and, God, man.  Jeez.  Just a pussy in the middle of the night.  Just a pussy.  People get a little frightened in the dark.  Do you get scared at night?  Be honest.  Like, you wake up in the middle of the night, maybe some weird dream, or you convince someone's  in your room that's not there.  Yeah, it's like a normal thing.  And then you're scared to open your eyes.  I'm like, shouldn't this have left my stupid body when I became an adult? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Do you have any of that?  I'll hear noises downstairs or something.  Ha, ha.  Noises.  I'll hear it downstairs.  Well, that's more normal shit.  I'm talking about that stuff that has no bearing on any reality.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I can't watch scary movies at night.  Too scary.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, if I watch, you know, Evil Dad or something, it's got to be daytime.  And then everything's cool.  And then it starts getting dark, and I'm like, oh, I still remember the movie. 
[02:28:00]  What did I do?  I'm such a faggot.  I told you, that movie Joe recommended, Joe DeRosa recommended, was very frightening.  It got so stupid and cocksuckerish at the end.  Was it his home movies?  Yes.  It's the slope-shouldered ass.  But it was, no, it was, what was it called?  In something?  Insidious?  Insidious.  Insidious.  There were some creepy fucking moments in that movie, man.  Yes.  I'm not a big fan of horror movies. 
[02:28:30]  I don't watch many movies.  Do they not scare you, or do you hate them?  Oh, they scare me.  Yeah, me too.  But I don't switch them out.  I don't know.  I don't find enjoyment in them.  Like, people do, I guess.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I need a story.  Cool story with it.  Yeah.  This one had one.  Yeah, yeah.  But there were certain moments, like the little, the woman's in the, goes in the kid's room,  and the figure goes by outside the window, and then there's some kind of weird shit happening,  and the guy walks downstairs, and his front door is just wide open.  Oh, man.  Dude, fucking, it gave, it chilled me. 
[02:29:00]  Ah, that's scary.  I gotta see it, though.  Yeah, because there was a, the mother's going, because the mother sees some figure walk by the outside  upstairs window, and she's like, there's somebody outside.  The upstairs window?  I think so.  It might have been.  It might have been the downstairs.  But she's like, somebody's outside.  I saw him.  I saw him.  And because the kid kept crying that somebody was outside, and then the father walks downstairs,  and the front door is just fucking wide open.  Dude.  Wow.  It was fucking.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I watched it alone at night. 
[02:29:30]  Insidious?  Insidious, yeah.  But then the movie, there's parts of it that got so douchey, you're like, what are you  doing?  You fucking had me terrified, and now I'm just looking at this fucking awful creature.  Right.  But there were parts of it that were great.  I got a scenario for you.  I think it's based on a Joe Rogan tweet.  Did Joe Rogan go searching for Bigfoot or something?  Or was that a dream I had?  I hope to God it was not a dream you had.  Ice cream.  He's shooting a TV show about that.  Okay.  Yeah.  On sci-fi.  So I read a tweet that I guess had something to do with that. 
[02:30:00]  And I was thinking to myself, I want to throw the scenario out there.  Most of us don't believe in Bigfoot, right?  Sure.  Okay.  So you go way up into the fucking woods.  Plus you go over to the morning mashup studio.  Big twitches.  So you're in the Pacific Northwest.  Yeah.  And you get the locals.  They pull over.  They go, okay, you know, Bigfoot has been spotted somewhere in these woods straight ahead.  It is pitch fucking dark.  Yeah.  Okay.  Maybe they give you a flashlight.  But how far would you walk into the woods before you're completely freaked out and have 
[02:30:30]  to stop?  You're going to be petrified.  How long?  Knowing in your head that you just don't believe in Bigfoot.  And I'm not talking about the other animals and all that other shit.  I'm talking just Bigfoot that you are convinced doesn't exist.  Immediately.  How far would you get in the woods?  One foot.  You'd be totally out of your mind, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Are there guys out there that would go, fuck this and just keep walking no problem?  Yeah.  The big talkers.  The eggs on Twitter. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, the eggs?  Eggs.  The avatar eggs?  Yep.  Yeah.  That's creepy.  You wouldn't last, right?  Do I have my gun?  Yeah.  Even with that, though, you'd be probably like, holy fuck.  A gun would help a lot.  That helps a lot.  All right.  How many feet more would you go with a gun?  Three feet.  Okay, yeah.  I would like to think, you know, I would just, like, face that ridiculous fear and just keep  walking.  Yeah.  Just keep walking in. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  When me and Melinda got lost in the woods that time, at night time came around, I was  petrified.  But I couldn't, you know, I had to keep it together.  You had to try to look like you weren't.  Yeah, I kept it together.  Were you just seeing things everywhere?  Dude.  We were, like, laid down to go to sleep.  We're covered with, like, one jacket.  And I just kept one eye open.  I'm looking like, what the fuck is that in the tree line?  Right.  How lost were you? 
[02:32:00]  I know we've gone over this a lot, but how lost were you, really?  So fucking lost.  You really were.  Had no clue if I would have been walking for another month or we were one minute away  from getting out.  And you saw no lights of houses or a little town?  In the middle of the fucking mountains.  Were you mad at her?  Trees.  I was livid.  Livid.  Oh, we'll go down this way.  No, I'd rather go the way we came.  I'd rather go back the way we came up. 
[02:32:30]  No, no, I know we go down this way.  Instead, it's faster.  How is it faster?  But I listened and wound up lost.  Wow.  Is this it?  What's that?  The Conjuring?  Yeah.  Is that scary, too?  Yeah.  Looks scary.  Wait, can we...  Let's watch the trailer from the beginning.  Well, that woman's in every horror movie.  Yeah.  She's the...  Who farted?  I did.  No, I swear.  Did not.  I'm glad I have a cold.  I heard you.  When have I ever not admitted a fart?  He does admit.  Wow, that's yours, Jimmy.  It is. 
[02:33:00]  I know now.  You're right.  Oh, I'm so glad I have a cold.  What are you pushing out today?  Nothing.  What are you pushing out?  That was more just the whole trial.  I'm just watching.  My body's just getting rid of the whole trial.  The whole trial's been in there for so long, my body's tossing out that trial.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, who's this chick?  Hey, hey, babe.  Hey, hey.  Friend of yours?  Yeah, you know, she wants to be.  I didn't appreciate that nonchalant wave there.  I was just like, uh-huh.  Who is she?  Some broad.  Yeah, Sam.  Sam? 
[02:33:30]  You know why I'm scuttlebutt around this joint.  I'll investigate.  She must be new.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because I don't know her yet.  Still a recon.  That a boy, Sammy.  That a boy.  Oh, I will.  You want to see this Conjuring thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is from the scary part.  Oh, it's a Conjuring?  Oh.  It's an awful happened here.  It's a true story from the 70s about two people that are like paranormal, witch hunter type  people that go into houses and stuff like that.  How old is this movie?  It's coming out like next week.  Oh, okay.  Look how nice.  It's like they wash the color out and everything. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  It just looks scary.  Right.  It's a true story.  And it's horrifying, they say.  Let me see it, Sam.  I'll kiss you.  The Conjuring.  Don't kiss me.  Red.  What is it?  Ah!  Fuck you, you cuck sucker.  Stop.  Jesus Christ.  It takes a toll on her.  A little piece each time.  Oh, my God.  You have a lot of spirits in here.  But there's one that I'm most worried about because it is so hateful. 
[02:34:30]  It's me.  What did she make me do?  Creepy kid.  Ah!  Ah, fuck.  This is yours.  That's not gonna help.  Why would you give yourself to this?  This thing has latched itself to your family.  I don't like to have seen nothing like this.  You hate this?  I don't like this.  I'm coming with you.  No way.  I can't lose you.  Wait!  There's a lady in a dirty nightgown that I see in my dreams. 
[02:35:00]  She's standing in front of my mom's bed.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Do you want to see him?  Yeah.  And the music stops.  You'll see him in the mirror standing behind you.  Look what she made me do.  Oh my god.  Jesus!  No!  I don't like this! 
[02:35:30]  Oh my god!  I hate this shit!  Oh my god!  I don't like it!  I hate this shit!  I just have a little scream.  Ew!  I see you!  My arm hair was standing up!  Yeah, no, I got the...  That was so scary!  That was so scary!  That was so scary!  That was so scary!  Well done!  Your arm hair!  Your reactions were grown men!  The whole show should go!  I'm a father of two for Christ's sake!  Kenny has to go!  Yes!  I guess I have a screening for all of us after the show.  Oh yes!  Today?  The whole show, though.  Well, that's...  Now!  Where'd it go today? 
[02:36:00]  Trident!  Probably at 11 a.m.  I'll only do it there.  What day works for everybody?  July on Teeth is my birthday.  Hello!  Wait, your birthday's right around the corner.  I know.  I'm dumped like the big party's not planned.  When's the dude coming?  Oh god.  We're not going to friggin' on a date, so that's where we're going.  When does the movie open?  Fuck that shit!  Two weeks?  Or no, it might be this week.  I'll go if everyone goes.  But then I know what's going to happen.  We have good intentions, and then I'm the...  Me and Jimmy are the only dopes in the theater.  No, I'll go. 
[02:36:30]  We all gotta go.  Yeah, we all have to go.  On Jimmy's birthday?  No, on Friday.  It's Friday.  I'm flying home on the red-eye the night before.  It's like Wednesday?  You're right.  Was it Wednesday?  We do it Wednesday after the advice show.  No, Wednesday I fly to L.A.  I'm doing L.A.  Tomorrow.  I'll see if we get it tomorrow, then.  Let's do it tomorrow.  I can't do tomorrow.  I can't do...  I can't, because I have construction in my house.  Construction?  Yeah, they're building that shelving unit for me, finally.  You're right.  Levels.  You...  Just levels. 
[02:37:00]  I know, I really did.  Fucking asshole open first.  Backed right in.  Fuck that!  I don't like that shit.  That was so scary, dude.  Who finds that enjoyable?  I love it.  I find it enjoyable, because right after the utter horror, I start laughing at how fucking  gay I am.  Right.  My fucking hand...  The hand on my arm stands up.  Yeah, I got chills.  The way that at the end, that music's going cling, when it stops, and you know there's  only one note left.  Right.  Ding!  Right.  And then she looks behind, and she's like...  But there's nothing, but then in front of it... 
[02:37:30]  But then she puts the music box down, and it's right in front of her fucking face.  Is that a true story?  Yeah.  No, it's not.  It is!  She should conjure some pekka juice out of me.  It's scary.  God.  It's probably good marijuana or something.  Fuck, yeah.  I saw that trailer in theaters.  Were you scared?  The trailer is so scary in theaters when the thing is behind the thing.  Where people, like, freaking out?  Yeah.  And I was like, Jazz, we gotta see that.  And Kenny has to see, because Kenny won't watch scary movies.  Kenny doesn't like scary movies.  Right.  You guys won't know.  It's gotta be this week.  It's coming out.  Look, Roland, if we set this up, we have to have access to our phones. 
[02:38:00]  I know sometimes they put that one asshole in there, even though there's ten of us watching  the movie to make sure we don't, you know, make a copy.  Oh, to make videos?  We gotta make reaction videos.  We don't need to fucking shoot the actual movie.  I would laugh at it.  What the fuck you, ghost?  Because I didn't watch more movies myself.  You're coming.  You're coming, too.  You have to.  You gotta.  I watched some of the rom-coms.  No, it's a fucking horror movie.  It's a scary movie of someone that shows up and does a good job for eight hours. 
[02:38:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Perfect.  That's regular job.  Are we all in or what?  Jim said he can't go this week.  Yeah, because I have.  We'll go next week, then.  It's already gonna be in theaters.  Who cares?  It's good.  They're not gonna set up a screening to promote a movie that's already out.  Why not?  For that second week.  Really?  The second week numbers drop.  Come on.  The second week numbers.  I'll just go see it in a theater with a fuck.  I need a girl, though, to come.  Yo, baby.  Yo.  What?  Shut up.  Why?  And if any of that shit happened in your compound, would you stay there? 
[02:39:00]  Wouldn't you just say, fuck this, and then you go to the local hotel and figure shit  out?  God.  They would never go back into the house.  No, but the family's still in there.  It's 87% rind tomatoes, too.  How many?  87.  Oh, I thought you said 18.  No.  Don't brag.  No, it looks good.  It really looks good.  They said the lady's got a dirty nightgown.  I bet if she was looking for a thing of whisk.  So, Opie and Anthony, will you commit to going?  Yeah.  This week.  Well, we want Jimmy there. 
[02:39:30]  We all want to go as a team, Sam.  You're not gonna set up a screening next week.  Go cock.  What day are you available?  Cock and balls.  He's not.  I'm only available, I mean, today at one point I could probably do, but tomorrow, again,  I have construction and I'm shooting a little TV show.  Oh, wow.  Which one?  John Fugleson has a show on Fuse.  Okay.  No, on current TV.  I'm doing.  Oh, by the way, Friday's, Saturday's Red Eye that I shot on Friday, it didn't air because 
[02:40:00]  of the trial, but it's on tonight.  Or actually, you know, 3 a.m., Red Eye.  It was very good.  Ann Coulter and Buck Sexton.  We had a lot of laughs.  It was a very good episode, I think.  Tune in.  Thank you.  Oh, God, this fucking cold is the worst.  You want to know who I'm on the Tonight Show with?  Who?  You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming. 
[02:40:30]  Really?  No way.  The guy that was at the storage locker.  Absolutely.  Dr. Childress.  Dr. Schultz, whatever his name is.  Yeah, Hopkins is the lead guest.  And the second guest is Ms. Amy Schumer.  Wow.  Damn.  Fun one.  I was watching a special on Johnny Carson.  It's on Netflix.  It was on PBS, I guess.  And it's just kind of a thing, a bunch of interviews with everyone, fucking talk show hosts and whatnot. 
[02:41:00]  Leno.  Sure.  Letterman and guys from his past, guys that worked on the Tonight Show.  It's a great talk.  Well, I'd love to see that.  It's so cool to watch old Tonight Show footage.  I could sit there for fucking hours and just watch him talking to guests from like the 70s and 80s and shit.  With their drinks and their cigarettes.  Dude, it's so fucking...  Yeah.  And the shit they would talk about.  It was less formal. 
[02:41:30]  It felt less formal.  It felt loose.  I mean, these guys, for whatever reason, they can't do it that way anymore.  Everything has to be so polished and perfect.  And those guys, I'm convinced a lot of times they really weren't booked for the show.  And they're like, oh, Bob Hope happens to be...  Hey, how you doing?  Wants to come in and say hi.  And it was a whole documentary on him, really.  His life, Tony's life and growing up and stuff.  His mother was a real fucking cunt.  Oh, what a cunt.  I think I saw that one actually, especially.  Yeah.  Where she wouldn't...  She said something nasty when the reporter was there about his mother. 
[02:42:00]  Yes.  Yeah, like, oh, that wasn't funny.  His mother was a cunt.  And walked up.  Yeah, yeah.  She would just say, like, awful things about him.  And he just wanted our acceptance.  And it was a really good piece on him, though.  And where was this?  It was on Netflix.  Oh, okay.  I'm going to check that out.  Yeah.  It's a documentary?  Yeah, yeah.  A Carson?  Yeah.  Fuck, I'd watch that in a second.  I know.  It's so fucking cool.  That's just...  Well, one might...  Forget it.  So fucking cool.  People know Netflix is the place to go. 
[02:42:30]  Of course it is.  Especially their documentary section.  Yeah, yeah.  Always pick up on a good documentary.  Bunch of that good shit.  Someone's saying we've got to see the first trailer for The Conjuring.  Oh, man.  I already got...  I finally got wound down.  Is there another trailer?  Here's the teaser.  Oh, it's just a teaser.  That was the main trailer again.  It's in my own room.  Oh, really?  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  I told you it's in the room.  What?  It's...  Oh, no.  The mic's in the way.  Five, two, three, four, nine, ten. 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Zombies.  First class.  What could possibly be wrong with this movie?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's just the fun and free 70s.  She's...  Innocence.  Blindfolded, feeling around the room.  Oh, fuck.  The door opened up in the room.  Yeah, it's pretty great.  What the fuck?  I'm gonna get you now. 
[02:43:30]  She's blindfolded.  You're just clapping in the closet.  She's feeling around in the closet.  She's blindfolded.  Pulls the blindfold off.  You took your blindfold off.  I win.  I was in Christine and Andy's room.  All right.  All right.  Nothing happened.  There's nowhere in the closet to close.  That's very creepy.  Then how did somebody clap?  Fucking mirrors in these movies.  God damn it.  I hate mirrors.  Girls, it's way past your bedtime.  She heard a noise.  Oh, boy.  She's going to investigate. 
[02:44:00]  The girls are asleep.  What's making the noise?  Fuck that!  Fuck, watch.  Oh, man.  She's falling down.  She just fell off the wall.  She's walking around the house.  Don't go there.  Don't go there.  Don't go there.  We don't need you to investigate, ma'am.  Oh, no. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, my God.  Why is she doing this?  Don't go down there.  You never go down the basement.  Oh, my God.  Don't ever go down.  All right.  It's just a lot of things covered up.  Who's ever down there?  I'm going to lock you in now.  Good thinking.  Oh, shit.  The door hit her in the face.  Help!  Andrea, help!  She's down in the basement by herself?  Yes, with the light off.  Oh, she's got a match, though.  That's cool. 
[02:45:00]  Is she alone?  Yeah.  But the match can't see too far, but she's going to try anyway.  This bitch is going to burn her face.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  We got to set up a screening.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  No.  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  No.  I don't like that.  You guys got to go.  You guys should be way worse than Jimmy.  We're shot jocks, Sam Roberts.  I can't.  Fuck that.  With the fucking hair on my arms and around my soft penis is standing up. 
[02:45:30]  That was so fucking scary.  Fuck that.  If we set up a screening for tomorrow or Wednesday, can you two commit to it?  When?  Tomorrow or Wednesday.  Yes.  But I want Jimmy.  But he can't go this week.  All right.  But if Kenny goes and Roland goes, I'm still in.  Kenny and Roland have to go.  Yes.  I'm still in.  Fair?  Me?  And they can't do it today?  Kenny and Roland?  Yeah.  I can't go today.  Okay.  So we'll do it. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  But we have to be able to make reaction videos.  Me and Iraq will go, too.  The Conjuring.  The Conjuring.  No, it's cool.  You guys are going.  But for the fucking bit, I want those guys.  No, of course.  Yeah.  Those are the guys that are going to.  Well, we're going to react pretty bad, too, obviously.  I'll be there on the duty of keeping Roland awake.  That's so scary.  Fuck that.  Dude.  That's that shit.  They fucking do it right.  When you get people that can make a movie like that and do it right like that, it's so funny. 
[02:46:30]  You don't know where it's coming from.  You spend the whole movie going, ah, because you don't know.  Oh, is that scary?  You think there's some downtime where it's just some nice dialogue.  But then you don't know of the next second, so you can't ever.  Is there another great groovy 60s song in there?  Oh, yeah.  Anything?  That's like paranormal activity when there's just conversations going on in the kitchen  and you're just sitting there waiting for all the kitchen drawers to open. 
[02:47:00]  And you know it's coming.  You're not even listening to the conversation.  You're just looking around like, all right, where's the cover from?  Yes.  See, the thing, the funny part is, like, they'll cut.  All right, we got to redo that.  There was a problem with the match.  So whoever's hands they were is like, I'm going to run to craft services and grab a fucking.  I know.  I'm going to grab a turkey sandwich with the clapping in the dark hands.  Those hands were holding, were wiping an asshole an hour before.  I know.  I know. 
[02:47:30]  That was scary, man.  Yeah.  I fucking laugh at that stuff.  What's up, Dev?  All right, we're going to take a break.  Is Dev short for devil?  Where's our second breakfast?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What's Jackie doing?  I'm sure somebody's keeping her from bringing it.  What?  Any news on our breakfast?  Last night, she's on her way.  Oh, our little angel.  Be careful.  Well, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, we're going to go with the story of the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  You'd think it might be the George Zimmerman verdict. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, no.  I think the story of the weekend was the fake fucking names on TV.  That's fucking great.  The greatest TV hoax slash prank ever.  Ever.  Nothing can top that.  Tell me something that beats this.  Fed right into them.  Oh, man.  They had no clue.  Don't we have a guest when we get back, too?  Who?  Oh.  I don't know if it's a surprise.  Holy shit.  Are you, aren't we dumb?  Who?  Oh, Christ.  What is the fun? 
[02:48:30]  Yep.  For how long?  Half an hour.  Oh.  Oh.  It's very exciting, huh?  Why today?  I am very excited.  Why today?  Why not?  Why not?  I mean, this is a big guest.  Then we should do this part now.  You got the video, Sam Roberts?  Yeah, we could, but this interview is actually going to take a half hour.  Huh?  You could close the show with this video.  You could take a break, come back, interview the guest, and then play the video. 
[02:49:00]  Let's make sure we have time for this, even though most people have, everyone has heard  it, but.  There's no way you could talk to this dude on the phone for a half hour.  You're not going to do that, are you?  Oh, I could.  Could it be fucking.  What were you doing, Bob?  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to give it away.  It'd be five minutes.  Five minutes.  Yeah.  Five minutes?  Yeah.  I only have a few questions.  All right, good.  Big ya pecker.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM. 
[02:49:30]  See?  Told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to...  The O.P. Anthony Show.  Got a very special guest on our phone line.  A mystery guest.  Ah.  Here we go. 
[02:50:00]  Hello.  He's laughing.  He's laughing.  Hello, sir.  The one who's barely awake.  Are you in Los Angeles?  No, I live in Seattle.  You live in Seattle?  Oh, nice.  That's still West Coast, so you're on West Coast time.  I love Seattle.  I only went once, and I hit perfect weather.  And people are like, oh, look, relax.  Is the rain thing real?  Of course not. 
[02:50:30]  Well, it's all a ruse by the Chamber of Commerce to keep people away.  Does it work?  I'm looking at Mount Rainier right now, and I see an eagle flying.  Wow.  That gives you some idea of the sensibility here.  I would think it was still dark out.  In Seattle?  6.30, man.  Oh, 6.30.  6.30, there.  All right.  Well, I want to welcome to our show the wonderful Mr. Tom Skerritt.  Tom Skerritt. 
[02:51:00]  Everybody's been talking about you for a long time, sir.  There's a room full of you.  Yes, there is a room full of us.  I'm a huge fan of yours over the years.  I keep bringing your name up in various movies and whatnot that you've been in.  And quite frankly, people in the room here and on the show have gotten on me about it.  They say I'm a little obsessed with Tom Skerritt and Tom Skerritt movies.  The word is annoyed. 
[02:51:30]  Annoyed.  They could be annoyed.  A little bit, sir.  They could be annoyed.  Your career spans many years all through television.  I still see shows on the...  You've got Me TV out there.  It's like kind of a classic television thing.  And they play like Bonanza and stuff.  And all of a sudden, I'll look and go, holy crap, Tom Skerritt's on Bonanza.  Who?  Tom Skerritt.  Oh.  He was on...  Did you start doing all those kind of hour TV shows back in the 60s and whatnot? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  I have had that experience of looking at...  Coming across something I did a long time ago that I don't recognize.  And it's...  I've seen myself and looked at that person so long ago.  And wondered, who is that guy?  He looks vaguely familiar.  It's Tom Skerritt.  Definitely.  Do you love being Tom Skerritt? 
[02:52:30]  I would.  Well, I certainly like who I am.  Yeah, yeah.  Hi, Mr. Skerritt.  Chip Chipperson here.  Do you guys ever get together like the old group from like Top Gun and stuff and just  kind of get together for reunions and whatnot?  Chip.  No, I think those things happened 50 years ago when people lived in Los Angeles.  But most of us who don't have to live in Los Angeles live elsewhere.  So it's just that, you know, we're all over the country and we're doing different things. 
[02:53:00]  We have different...  I have a life outside of the business, so...  Yeah.  What do you like to do when you're not acting?  Well, I'm a writer.  And I have a film school we started here in Seattle 10 years ago, which teaches storytelling.  Really?  And in any medium.  Focused on cinema, of course.  But the success of that thing, that particular school, has given us the initiative to go 
[02:53:30]  down to Fort Lewis and teach storytelling to PTS vets down there.  We started a year ago.  It's like the top gun of writing and storytelling.  I think you...  Yeah, that's pretty...  I had never heard it put that way.  Well, you know what?  I'm a huge fan, Tom Skerritt, so I know everything you've done.  He would love to be you, sir.  In depth.  You don't understand.  You don't understand.  He's had a great career.  He was in one of my favorite movies of all time, which, of course, is Alien. 
[02:54:00]  That one, I think, was one of your best movies, sir.  I gotta say.  Thank you.  That was quite a treat doing it.  Yeah, it must have been working with...  And your character, everyone thought you were going to be the hero in that one.  You know, you were the guy, kind of the head of the Nostromo there, and then it turns out  to be Ripley.  You know?  Kind of a big twist back then.  They didn't usually do that back in the 70s. 
[02:54:30]  No, they didn't.  Everything about that was alternative.  I'll put it that way.  Interestingly, I initially had turned that down because it was...  They sent it to me, it had a $2 million budget attached to it and no director.  Wow.  And I just...  And no one else was involved, so I just didn't really see it as being a $2 million and no  director, a very secure position. 
[02:55:00]  Really?  Wow.  Well, they called me a few weeks later and said, and I had just seen Ridley Scott's The  Duelist, and these guys called back and said, Ridley Scott's going to be directing it and  the budget's up to $10 million.  And I said, of course, I've got to work with Ridley Scott, so...  Yeah.  He is quite amazing.  It was more about Ridley Scott than it was initially about the material.  Yeah, and you know what?  Not really name actors in that, except for... 
[02:55:30]  What's his name there?  The Android.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, John...  Oh, John Hurt.  John Hurt.  John Hurt.  Ian Hurt.  Ian Hurt, yeah.  Ian Hurt, yeah.  Two wonderful English actors.  Yes.  It's a nice group of actors.  Nice company of people.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I love that one.  And of course, you know, Top Gun.  A lot of it has been said and made about Top Gun and the, let's just say, homoeroticism 
[02:56:00]  that was in there.  What?  Did you notice that in the script?  Your hero's laughing at you now.  No wonder, no wonder, God, the rest of the guys get annoyed. 
[02:56:30]  See, you see it our way now, sir.  Tom Skerritt's laughing at you.  He's laughing at me.  At you, not with you.  Tom Skerritt's laughing at me.  That's funny.  Oh, man.  I thought I was doing this in-depth question about, no, the volleyball scene was normal.  It was just a normal scene, is what Tom Skerritt was saying.  All right.  All right.  Maybe I overstepped my boundary there. 
[02:57:00]  It's a nice fun game of volleyball.  Why are you looking so deep into it?  Just a movie.  Oh, but Tom Skerritt.  I'm just thinking of it as how it was.  Homoeroticism.  Very, very.  That was the perfect movie for the 80s, too, wasn't it?  Sorry, I mean.  I guess it was, evidently.  Cold War thing, you know, very macho.  Yeah.  You know, if you take away the homoeroticism, I apologize, Mr. Skerritt. 
[02:57:30]  Were they flying their own planes, or did they train them to fly their own planes, or were  they using, like, other pilots?  Chip.  It's a fair question.  No, it's not.  Tom Cruise does his own stunts.  They would never put an actor behind the wheel of one of those things.  That's a $50 million plane.  Did you ever take a ride along?  I have to say, I did go up in an F-80.  I didn't go up during Top Gun, but I went up with the Blue Angels once, and the guy let 
[02:58:00]  me fly it.  Now, that's a thrill.  Wow.  Was it horrifying?  Not horrifying.  I would think it would be horrifying.  I mean, it would be an adrenaline rush, but...  I can't really describe it.  It's somewhat like not being on the moon, but being on the moon.  Yeah.  Something you'll never experience again.  Yeah, I got her, man.  Tom Skerritt, what are you working on now? 
[02:58:30]  Several things right now.  I, as far as the acting is concerned, I just finished doing a film in Virginia called Field  of Lost Shoes, which is a film about the Civil War.  I play General Grant.  Oh.  And writing a web series called Striller Gangs for a company we're starting up here, and  specifically, right at the moment, in about an hour, leaving Fort Lewis, our joint voice 
[02:59:00]  base, Lewis McCord, to begin our next session of teaching storytelling to PTS vets, which  is really the thing I'm really proud of.  Oh, that's great.  Very noble.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  Oh, my goodness.  The Red Badge Project.  Tell your audience that we're welcoming donations gladly.  We have to expand the class to include visual arts, visual storytelling, and music as well. 
[02:59:30]  It's all art, it's all storytelling, every lyrics, poetry, everything like that.  Where can they get that info?  You can go to the Red Badge Project.  Okay.  Cool.  Go look that up.  .com.  It should have the information.  Great.  I got to tell you, Tom Skerritt, this has been a treat for me. 
[03:00:00]  Like I said, huge fan, and best of luck and continued success.  What a great career you've had, sir.  Well, thank you very much.  Great talking to you guys.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  Mr. Skerritt, who did you play in Barnaby Jones?  I just seen that he was in Barnaby Jones.  Did I do a Barnaby Jones?  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't even know.  He did.  He's done so much.  He's done so many of those shows.  I can't remember.  A lot of stuff gets to be, you know, this largely is about people in the places rather  than the particular shows.  Right.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  And in the end, that's what I take away with me, and I don't remember doing a lot of that.  My mother loved that show.  Yeah.  That's great.  Thank you.  Tom Skerritt, thanks so much for spending a little time with us.  Oh, my pleasure, gentlemen.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks so much.  Yeah, take care, all.  Bye-bye.  Take care.  All right.  All right.  There goes Tom Skerritt.  Who is that?  He sounds like he writes poems.  Yeah.  He sounded a little like Eastwood in Play Mystic. 
[03:01:00]  In Play Mystic for me.  Just kind of had that delivery.  My poetry is a great radio show.  Heavy Boston accent.  Like, I didn't...  Was that a Boston accent?  Was it?  It sounded like a really regional accent.  Kind of a...  Kind of a mellow dude.  He's the greatest.  Yeah, I'm Skerritt.  Tom Skerritt.  Oh, man.  He's a great actor.  He laughed for like two minutes straight over your question.  You know what?  I assumed he might have some info on the homoeroticism of Top Gun. 
[03:01:30]  He thought you were probably gay.  Yeah.  Yeah?  He thinks you're gay for Top Gun.  Absolutely.  Yeah, he does.  As do we all.  So why don't we play the...  I'm Tom Skerritt thinking I'm gay.  Let's play the Quentin Tarantino thing.  That's what you were referring to.  No.  Everybody knows.  Well, maybe we should play this for Tom Skerritt.  Do we have that today there, E-Rock?  I'm sure he's listening.  I do.  But do you want the video of it, or do you just want me to play the audio here?  Whatever.  We do a radio show.  You know what one of the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood is? 
[03:02:00]  What?  Top Gun.  Oh, come on.  Top Gun is fucking great.  What is Top Gun?  Do you think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots?  Yeah.  It's about a bunch of guys waving their dicks around.  It is a story about a man who struggled with his own homosexuality.  No, seriously.  That is what Top Gun is about, man.  You've got Maverick.  All right?  He's on the edge, man.  He's right on the fucking line.  All right?  And you've got Iceman and all his crew.  Right.  They're gay.  And they represent the gay man.  Right.  All right?  And they're saying, go. 
[03:02:30]  Go the gay way.  Go the gay way.  He could go both ways.  But not Kelly McGillis, right?  Kelly McGillis.  She's heterosexuality.  She's saying, no, no, no, no, no.  Go the normal way.  Play by the rules.  Go the normal way.  And they're saying, no.  Go the gay way.  Be the gay way.  Go for the gay way.  All right?  That is what's going on throughout that whole movie.  It goes to her house, right?  All right?  It looks like they're going to have sex.  You know, they're just kind of sitting back.  He's taking a shower and everything.  They don't have sex.  He gets in the motorcycle, drives away.  She's like, what the fuck?  What the fuck is going on here?  Next scene.  Next scene you see her.  She's in the elevator.  She is dressed like a guy.  She's got the cap on. 
[03:03:00]  She's got the aviator glasses.  She's wearing the same jacket that the Icemen wear.  She goes, okay, this is how I got to get this guy.  This guy's going toward the gateway.  So I got to bring him back.  I got to bring him back from the gateway.  So I'm going to do that.  I'm going to dress like a man.  All right?  That is how she approaches it.  Right.  All right?  But the real ending of the movie is when they fight the mix at the end.  All right?  Because he has passed over into the gateway.  They are this gay, fighting fucking force.  All right?  And they're beating the Russians.  The gays are beating the Russians.  All right?  And it's over.  And they fucking land.  And Iceman has been trying to get Maverick the entire time. 
[03:03:30]  Finally, he's got him.  All right?  And what is the last fucking line that they had together at all?  Hugging and kissing and happy with each other?  And Ice comes at the Maverick, and he says, man, you can ride my tail in his time.  And what does Maverick say?  Maverick, you can ride my sword fight!  Sword fight!  Sword fight!  Sword fight!  Jesus Christ.  There you go.  There you go.  That's what you were referring to, I believe.  That was.  Tom Skerritt.  I got laughed at by Tom Skerritt. 
[03:04:00]  Look at an eagle flying.  Yeah.  You know what else I realized?  What?  I have nothing to say to Tom Skerritt.  Oh, man.  You've been looking forward to this, Dave, for a while.  Yeah, I have been, you know?  I wish he was around so I could have him sign my alien poster.  I asked him some good questions.  You did, Chip.  That was really good.  They were terrific.  Is the Post really trying to make people think Shark...  Shark...  Wait, it was Sharknado.  Shark Nadal.  Sharknado is possible in New York City?  Come on.  Is that in the paper today?  Sharknado.  Could it happen here?  They didn't do one of those could it happen here bullshit stories, did they? 
[03:04:30]  I think they're probably kidding.  It's probably tongue-in-cheek.  I hope so.  I hope so.  By the way...  Pussy.  Fuck yeah.  Right up the cunt.  Jesus.  How nice are you going to be when fucking A-Rod is just drummed out of baseball?  That's what happened, right?  That dummy's the only one with a shot at the home run record, too.  And he's fucking...  He's going to fall short.  I hate him.  Is that really going to happen there?  I hope so.  Travis.  Travis, I'm a baseball guy.  Choking bum.  What happened?  Swing and a miss. 
[03:05:00]  They're going to kick A-Rod out of baseball, you think?  See, I'm walking down to talk about Shark-O-Cane, and then you guys are talking about baseball.  I think it's Shark...  No, the Post is talking...  What's Shark-O-Cane?  Oh, Shark-O-Cane's different than Sharknado?  Yeah, see, the Post acknowledges that a Sharknado is probably not possible.  But...  A Shark-O-Cane...  Oh, so they have to be accurate with their ridiculous story?  Yeah.  How could they lift...  How could a hurricane lift sharks up?  Well...  It can't.  The New York Post explains it all in their article over the weekend.  Oh, good thing.  And what do they say? 
[03:05:30]  While it's far-fetched, it is possible that sharks could be carried to the city by waves  and then, you know, kill everyone.  There's a photo of the last time that happened.  Yeah, see?  Oh, wow, right around the Statue of Liberty.  See?  Wow, those are big sharks.  The sharks are as big as...  Bigger.  They're way bigger than the Statue of Liberty.  The Statue of Liberty sideways.  That's like a toothpick to the shark.  Yeah, they're big.  Damn.  Those are like 250,000 ton sharks.  You have no idea.  No concept of math. 
[03:06:00]  If a raging hurricane were to strike New York City, it could suck up sharks and other  sea creatures, triggering a Shark-O-Cane.  A horrifying real-life twist on the campy hit flick Sharknado.  Marine biologists, Warren.  Marine biologists?  Yeah.  Biologists.  I'm a marine biologist.  Oh, we have a jellyfish at King.  The sea was angry that day, my friends.  Can we do the Asian name? 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God, yes.  There's a big lawsuit, of course.  Is there a lawsuit?  No, why wouldn't there be?  Well, the airline is saying that this dumb thing that this news station did is ruining  their name.  And I would say, I think what ruins their name is the fact that three people died in  a horrific landing out there in San Francisco.  The fact that your pilot hit the seawall is a lot worse than some wacky, stupid, fake  names.  Yeah, yeah.  This is how it went down.  We got a better copy? 
[03:07:00]  I think so.  This is so bad.  Hit and killed by a firetruck.  God damn it.  You survive the landing, the crash landing, and then you get run over on the runway because  you were thrown from the plane.  Oh, wait.  It's a teen killed in an Asiana crash, was hit by a firetruck.  Yeah, they're still trying to determine if she was dead or not.  Oh, okay.  God, if she was dead.  But she definitely got hit by a firetruck.  Oh, yeah.  That's like a cartoon.  Crazy.  I think we said that last week.  Yeah.  All right.  The coroner is still trying to determine the cause of death and whether she was already 
[03:07:30]  dead when the truck hit her.  We have new information now also on the plane crash.  KTVU has just learned the names of the four pilots who were on board the flight.  They are Captain Sum Ting Wong, Wee Tu Lo, Ho Li Fook, and Bang Ding Au.  The NTSB has confirmed these are the names of the pilots on board flight 214 when it crashed.  We are working to determine exactly what roles each of them played during the landing on Saturday. 
[03:08:00]  No one will...  Investigators will...  Hey, look.  It's all serious.  And investigators...  How the fuck do you fall for that?  What a...  Read the names.  Just read the names.  What was she thinking as she was reading the names?  No one will ever beat that.  No, that's a great one.  Sum Ting Wong.  Sum Ting Wong.  Wee Tu Lo.  Wee Tu Lo.  And she was smart enough not to say fuck and pronounce it fook.  She was probably like, how does this pronounce fook?  Right.  I want to make sure.  How did that make it through? 
[03:08:30]  It came from the NTSB.  I think you should fire everybody.  Everyone gets fired.  Even people that weren't working that day.  Not because it's offensive.  For sheer incompetence.  For just being a stupid human being.  There was an apology?  Oh, yeah.  I would hope so.  I haven't heard the apology.  Very upsetting.  The rest of the media refuses to play this clip.  They won't play it.  But it's all over the internet.  They comment on it, too.  They're like, and we will not be playing the clip.  No, no, no. 
[03:09:00]  But they want to make believe that, what?  We're not on the internet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Let me know what it is.  Holy fuck.  Fuck.  Oh, the same dopey redhead had to apologize there, Sam Roberts?  Looks like it.  All right.  Let's see the apology.  Names of pilots involved in the Oceana Airlines crash.  These names were not accurate, despite an NTSB official in Washington confirming them late  this morning.  We apologize for this error.  Tonight, we want to take a moment and say that we are sorry. 
[03:09:30]  Earlier today, during our new newscast, we misidentified the pilots in the Oceana Airlines crash.  We made several mistakes when we received this information.  First of all, we never read the names out loud, phonetically sounding them out.  Then, during our phone call to the NTSB, where the person confirmed the spellings of the names,  we never asked that person to give us their position within the agency.  We heard this person verify the information without questioning who they were, and then  we rushed the names onto our new newscast. 
[03:10:00]  There you go.  Within the last few minutes, the NTSB issued this statement.  Quote, the National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive  names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots.  A summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed  the names of the flight crew on the aircraft.  We work hard to ensure that only appropriate factual information regarding an investigation  is released, and we deeply regret today's incident. 
[03:10:30]  Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated.  That intern's a hero with his friends.  The NTSB, we want you to know here, we accept full responsibility for this mistake.  Oh, shut up.  Pause.  Gives a fuck.  I hate the full responsibility.  What does that mean, though?  That means something should happen to you.  It was just a dumb prank that got on the air.  You should get an on-air spanking or something.  At least he admitted to rushing on the air.  Thank you.  What a...  At least he admitted to rushing it on the air. 
[03:11:00]  Wait, so the intern came up with the fake names?  Yes.  Again, like the NBC intern.  They're always...  By the way, and I know somebody...  I don't completely buy it.  I believe that people were fired from NBC, and it was not an intern.  That's what I've been told.  It was not an intern who edited that tape.  No.  Of course not.  Yeah, how could you let an intern edit tape for broadcast, and then just accept it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's true.  Standards are low.  Not very.  Here?  High standards here.  What? 
[03:11:30]  Yep.  No.  Let's see if this idiot says anything else.  We're in the new newscast.  We also apologized on our website and on our social media site.  We heard you.  The fact is, we have a lot of good people here at Channel 2.  And on behalf of all of us, on behalf of all of us, I want to tell you that we pride ourselves  on getting it right and having the highest of standards and integrity.  No.  Something wrong.  High standards.  Holy fuck.  We heard you.  On ATVU, we can only offer our sincerest apology. 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  And he's just lying.  You don't have high standards.  You just fell for like a third-grader's prank.  One of the oldest tricks in the book.  How do you have high standards?  Our program director, Mike Hunt, says he's terribly sorry.  Yeah, now to weather with Phil McCracken.  Sports with Haywood.  Haywood, you blow me with sports.  That was Rocco's favorite.  Haywood, you blow me. 
[03:12:30]  Read this name.  I think that's how he did the bit.  You just have interns come in.  Read the name.  Haywood, you blow me.  It's funny, dude.  I think we may have a Conjuring screening today.  I can't today.  It's at 2 p.m.  I can't.  That's just not right.  I've got to go home.  But thanks.  Maybe I'll go today and you guys go tomorrow. 
[03:13:00]  Ooh.  Can we do that?  I don't see why not.  Well, can they do more than one?  I don't want to interfere with the show's screening.  It's so scary.  It is scary.  Well, the boys put a little production piece together to end today's show.  What is that?  Well, the Zimmerman trial is pretty much over.  Yeah, that's it.  And they put together a little I remember you piece. 
[03:13:30]  Oh.  Which we like to do in this show.  We have been talking about this for quite a while.  By we, I mean me.  We've all been chiming in, though.  I know.  I'm kidding.  I was obsessed.  I'm confused by that prank.  But you were...  I'm sorry.  I'm confused by that prank still.  Why?  So the intern comes up with the names, right?  Yeah.  And was just feeding it to all the news stations and only one bit?  Or maybe the intern just took that one call from that news station.  Uh-huh.  And they said, you have the names. 
[03:14:00]  And he said, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got them.  Yeah.  I got your names for you.  Sure.  So I don't think the names were written down ahead of time.  So I think someone just had the goofy names in there.  No.  They had to have them written down.  I don't understand.  You think we'll get to the bottom of this one?  So we'll move forward?  Maybe the people down there at the NDSB were making some jokes.  Whoa.  You know?  And saying, hey, what do you think the pilot's name was?  That's possible.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're making some jokes. 
[03:14:30]  And then the intern heard it.  And when they asked him what the names are, he's like, oh, yeah.  It's...  Yeah.  I need to know more.  Yeah.  I would love to know what the inside scoop is there.  They probably already killed a person, though.  Yeah.  The person's gone.  We'll see him no more.  Nah.  All right.  So here's the I remember you piece.  Aw.  Or I'll remember you.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  I will remember you. 
[03:15:00]  George Zimmerman.  George Zimmerman.  Who?  Will you remember me?  All right.  Good.  You're on the jury.  Don't let your life pass you by.  Nothing?  That's funny.  We've knocked on the memory.  There's a real suspicious guy.  Uh, it's retreating circle. 
[03:15:30]  I'm so tired.  I can't sleep.  This guy looks like he's up to no good.  Standing on the edge of something that you didn't know.  All right.  What is your...  Gunshots.  Gunshots.  You just heard gunshots?  Yes.  I can't say a word now.  We are screaming inside.  You just walking around looking about.  I will remember you. 
[03:16:00]  God, these assholes, they always get away.  Will you remember me?  And what is your decision, sir?  After consulting with counsel not to testify to them.  Let your life pass you by.  And excuse my language, but those were his words, not mine.  We've knocked on the memory.  Fucking punks.  These assholes, they always get away. 
[03:16:30]  We've knocked on the memory.  Creepy ass cracker.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  This is after Opie and Anthony live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:17:00]  Happy Monday.  I suppose.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  You can call in at 866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969.  I'm Sam Roberts.  E-Rock is here.  Jim has been trying to figure out who the guy who just walked into Shave 45 is for the 
[03:17:30]  last 10 minutes.  I found out.  Who was it?  It was not a big celebrity at all.  Who was it?  Someone last named Ross and not Rick or Jeffrey.  I told Roland, because he was trying to get Roland to tell him who it was.  Even though none of us knew.  You got to just say whoever.  Oh yeah, that guy over there is 2 Chainz.  And watch Jim go over.  It probably would work.  I told you.  They've gotten me before.  I'm not a part of that.  It's worth the risk for you.  Yeah.  You don't have to know who these people are.  Alright.  Well, I'm heading out now.  Where are you going?  I have an appointment at the gym to my trainer. 
[03:18:00]  Oh my.  That's right.  You're going to come back looking even better.  Well, please.  What do you think?  This body is a gift?  It's true.  That's the result of hard work and determination.  That a boy, Sam.  Way to go, Jim.  Let's go to 914.  To start after Open Anthony Live.  What's up, buddy?  I wanted to ask you to see the E-Raw comment sign on Money in the Bank last night during  the Brad Maddox segment.  Who's this?  Flea Man?  Yes, it is.  Oh, hello, Flea Man.  That's all. 
[03:18:30]  Just have a good day.  Alright, bye.  Yeah, E-Raw, you're a big star.  They didn't bring it up on the show today.  But we were talking about it on Twitter last night.  I'm watching the WWE did a pay-per-view last night.  And I'm watching it.  And midway through the show, you know, all the fans bring signs.  And they're panning the crowd while this dude, Brad Maddox,  is doing a promo in the ring.  And all of a sudden, there's a giant, a huge sign with big, bold,  unmissable black letters that says E-Raw comment. 
[03:19:00]  Very nice.  Were you excited?  Yeah, because I missed it while it was happening.  I was doing something else while I had the pay-per-view on.  What were you doing?  I was just cleaning up in the living room.  Landscaping?  Yeah.  Oh, did you have to clean up your toys before your wife makes you?  Yes.  Sucks.  Yeah, I just turned away.  I'm allowed to leave mine out.  And I say, because I tell my wife, if I clean up my toys in the morning, is that okay?  And she goes, yeah, but you just have to do it.  I go, okay.  Well, you had yours out so you could readjust the belt system.  That's exactly right.  But go on. 
[03:19:30]  And, yeah, so I just turned away from the TV, and then I came back, and, you know, Brad  Maddox is still talking, but then Twitter started going nuts.  Yeah, I was so, like, I saw it, and so I tweeted, and then my Twitter thing went crazy,  and luckily a couple people grabbed photos of it.  But I think both me, at NotSam, and E-Rock, at E-Rock Radio, tweeted out photos of that.  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  That's not you.  You've had a handful of E-Rock signs at wrestling shows, though.  Yeah, and we've never asked for it.  They just show up. 
[03:20:00]  Well, let me ask you, is the constant bashing and the making fun of you, is it worth it when  this is the fruit of that labor?  Like, you know the reason people make signs for you and nobody else is just because you're,  like, the lovable brother that everybody picks on.  Like, E-Rock comment is always associated with something negative on this show.  It's never like, E-Rock, you look great today, comment.  It's something completely derogatory.  But, you know, now you're a sign on your favorite thing, which is pro wrestling. 
[03:20:30]  Is it worth it?  I don't think it outdoes all the negativity I get on the show, but it's nice that it happens  once in a while.  It adds a little, like, okay, now I remember, this is why I do it.  No.  This is why I do what I do, because every now and then I turn on my wrestling and some  lucky E-Rock fan, little rocker, is sitting there in the audience, chubby little guy with 
[03:21:00]  a big sign that says E-Rock radio, or comment E-Rock.  And then as soon as it makes it on screen, security goes over and makes them take down  the sign.  Yeah, because they hate you.  It's security in every building.  It's like, no, no, no.  It's not a matter of the sign placement.  It's not show related.  Yeah, it seems far too pro-E-Rock.  773, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Is that me?  Yeah.  No, yeah, of course it's you.  No, I just wanted to make a suggestion for a nugget.  Oh, God. 
[03:21:30]  Can you do the Michael Jordan one sometime soon?  Okay, that works as a nugget.  You got it right.  That's a good suggestion, because there's far too many suggestions for nuggets that are not  nuggets.  People just tweet me and E-Rock saying, oh, you should do this.  If it's a shopping spree, that'll be a good nugget.  Right, and it's like, that's a full show length of nugget.  That's three hours long.  That's the longest nugget ever.  That's a full shit.  It's not just, a nugget is that little kernel of feces that just kind of floats around at  the bottom of the bowl.  Okay, it's not like a full dump. 
[03:22:00]  Play the toothpick guy.  Right.  That's a great nugget.  No.  How many E-Rock signs have there been on wrestling TV?  There's been, I know of three, but I only have screen caps of two.  What's your favorite one?  Well, that one now is my favorite, but the one before that was a Monday Night Raw.  It was a big yellow sign that said, we want E-Rock.  It had the wow logo on it.  For no reason.  Somebody make a we want E-Rock sign.  And then what was the other one that you don't have a picture of? 
[03:22:30]  It was years ago.  I don't remember.  It's when, it was probably like 2008.  It was another Monday Night Raw.  That's so funny.  It was a white one.  I remember white and black ink on it, but I never got a capture of it.  And you know that the person who made this sign last night is probably somebody you blocked  on Twitter for needling you.  Probably.  Because when people needle you, you block them, correct?  Plus, no, not when they needle, when they're just being flat out dicks.  Oh.  But when you're in Philly, and this is your time to put up ECW stuff and Rob Van Dam because 
[03:23:00]  he came back and all this other shit, they threw up an E-Rock sign.  They're thinking of you.  They're like, yeah, the pay-per-view is exciting, but even more exciting, it'll be Monday morning  when I get more E-Rock on the radio.  Thank you very much.  I mean, Baskin Robbins has started selling Coke floats in their store.  How old, do you realize, this is the power of E-Rock, that I want you to realize that  you have over people, do you know how many people drive by a Baskin Robbins sign, and 
[03:23:30]  there's a big poster outside that says, we have Coke floats.  Do you know how many people think of you when that happens?  Do you know?  Ah, Coke floats.  And then their wife goes, what's so funny about Coke floats?  Do you know that had nothing to do with me?  That was something, another thing that you started.  Don't get, don't be dumb.  Don't be ridiculous.  But people do send me photos of them drinking Coke floats.  They do.  You must like that.  And I, it's like, I've never had one.  They're delicious.  And I'm sure, I'm quite sure you have.  Paul.  Hi, guys.  I want to request a nugget. 
[03:24:00]  Several years ago, there was a guy that sent a book into the show, and it was about, like,  stuff for boys to do, and I hope he was reading passages from it and just tearing pages out.  That's not a nugget.  That's a bit.  Case closed.  That's why I'd hang up on him.  The nugget is what we put at the end of the podcast.  For those of you who haven't downloaded it yet, it's on iTunes.  And, you know, you can search it out on any of the podcast apps that are available for  the Android. 
[03:24:30]  It's, it, the nugget is the little thing.  We put on a little sound clip at the end of the podcast.  It was supposed to be, like, a secret, unadvertised, you know, bonus track type of situation.  But then Opie, especially, just became obsessed with it, and it was all he was talking about.  Now it's the centerpiece of the entire podcast.  Yeah, how can the centerpiece be ten seconds at the end of it?  Of audio that they didn't do.  They didn't even do it!  Yeah.  Quinn in California.  Hey, Sam, King of All Media.  I was just first to say thank you for the book and missed it. 
[03:25:00]  You got it.  I was wanting to ask, what's your opinion on the Jim and the verdict?  On the verdict?  Well, I think the verdict was probably right.  I kind of fall more in line with a lot of what Jim was saying.  I think the verdict, you can't complain about the verdict because of what was proven in court.  Now, if you're talking about legally, what was the right thing to do in that court case,  or morally, what do you think of the situation? 
[03:25:30]  Sure.  You know.  Well, I think, you know, legally, that seemed like the direction everything was headed in.  I didn't know.  If anything, I thought that manslaughter might come up.  Once they brought manslaughter in as a possible thing, I was like, okay, this is interesting  because that could feasibly happen if the jury started feeling guilty or started, you know,  emotions started to come in.  It's a lot easier for them to make a case for manslaughter than it would be for murder, too.  So, uh, but, because he, I mean, I don't think he can make a case for murder, too. 
[03:26:00]  But, and manslaughter's a difficult one, but if you work with emotions, it becomes much more easy.  Emotionally, I honestly think that, uh, maybe not legally, but on a strictly moral and emotional level,  the chain of events was started because George Zimmerman wanted to be a cop and wanted to be a hero,  and a person died unnecessarily, and that chain of events was started because of George Zimmerman. 
[03:26:30]  Uh, so, that, and I think that emotion is what everybody's going crazy about when they disagree with the verdict.  But, it's a very complicated case.  However, I definitely think that, I think George Zimmerman's an asshole.  You know, I think he's an asshole.  I think it's his fault.  But, as far as a crime on the books, that's a whole different scenario.  Um, Mike in Connecticut. 
[03:27:00]  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster, SQL Server agent on, uh, on Twitter.  Hey, so, I have a quick question.  When you are going to, um, the Gathering of the Juggalos,  will you be calling the main event at Juggalo Championship Wrestling,  kind of, Slabo Slam, between the new natural disasters, Roland and E-Rock?  Slabo!  E-Rock, will you be competing at the Gathering of the Juggalos this year?  No, I will not.  For Juggalo Championship Wrestling? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, he didn't even get that right.  Um, yeah, no, I, I, I would.  Do play-by-play for the Juggalos, if they acquired my services, certainly.  But I think it does look like Troy and I will be heading down to the Gathering of the Juggalos.  Let's go to Larry in Iowa.  Larry, we haven't heard from you in a while.  Well, it has been a while.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster, and, uh, by the way,  world-renowned professional wrestling expert,  and originator of the blatantly stolen, lonely, brutal concept. 
[03:28:00]  Right, right, right.  I really pondered this.  I've worked hard trying to find out why.  I'm thinking in my own brain why this hasn't happened.  How come for all the worst of shows, we never hear the gems from the after show?  Well, because the worst of show is Opie and Anthony's Time to Shine,  and I'm not here to take that away from them, am I?  I understand that, but their show's a four-hour show.  Right.  Give them a four-hour worst of, and then you get your hour,  since you drag them to the finish line every day. 
[03:28:30]  Well, I, yeah.  You have your worst of.  I got my own show, the Sam Roberts show.  It's on Sundays on the weekend, and I put in some after show stuff in there.  Oh, I know you do, Sam.  I know you do.  All right.  Thank you, Larry.  Thank you, Sam.  We'll see you.  All right.  It was a good Sam Roberts show on Sunday.  Colin Quinn was on, and I actually put the video on YouTube already,  but Colin Quinn was on for the Sam Roberts show interview,  and he was a blast, as he always is.  Yeah? 
[03:29:00]  Oh, no.  I was waiting for you to finish.  I didn't want to interrupt.  Oh, and Jason Biggs was on the show, too.  I heard that.  I was pissed because I missed it, but I heard the Jason Biggs interview was good.  Yeah, I didn't know really what to expect from him,  because I hadn't seen Orange is the New Black yet.  Have you seen it now?  Yeah, I watched it over the weekend.  I put on one episode, because I was like, you know what?  I just talked to this dude, because I interviewed Jason Biggs the same day  Orange is the New Black came out, and Orange is the New Black is this new series  on Netflix that's like a female prison drama comedy thing. 
[03:29:30]  I was talking about it last week, but I put on an episode because I just  interviewed Jason Biggs, and over the weekend, I ended up watching the first six.  I'm five episodes in.  It's such a great show.  It is.  It's a really good show.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of it, but the other girl from American Pie,  not Tara Reade, the Natasha Leone, she's great in that show.  Yeah, she's great. 
[03:30:00]  Everybody's good in that show.  It's well cast.  It's well everything.  It's just a sister from the 70s show in it.  Yeah, and you could see her titties in the first episode.  Did you notice that?  Oh, yeah.  Right, right.  Creepon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She gets naked.  Everybody gets naked.  This is why I can't believe it took people this long to figure out.  When you're watching Oz, you're like, this is a great show, because there's something  about prison drama that is just automatically compelling, probably because it's so frightening  to the rest of us that could never survive in a prison, to just be able to watch it and 
[03:30:30]  see these people and their lives unfold, and guys, a lot of guys watched Oz, because it's  an unbelievable show.  They put up with the fact that every episode is just full of penises.  You just look at dicks every episode, and it's okay, because the show is good enough.  It took this, however many years, since Oz came out, for somebody to figure out, why  don't we do a female prison drama?  And you don't have as many boobies as you did penises, but I mean, they show, there's 
[03:31:00]  a good amount of female nudity.  Not every episode.  There's enough that makes it better than regular television.  Yes.  You get reminded.  And there's enough that makes it so it's not like, it doesn't come off as overly fluffy.  No.  Like, we're ignoring the fact that these are women that are living in a prison together.  But, yeah, the lady who created Weeds created that show.  And the way they weave in the backstory for each prisoner is good, too.  And I think, you know what must have happened?  Because this is based on a true story.  Did you know this is a true story?  No.  Yeah, this is the woman who's in prison that the show is based on. 
[03:31:30]  She really went to prison for the drugs and all that stuff.  It's based on a true story.  So what they must have done is realized that female prisons are just full of ugly women.  And nobody's going to watch a show where ugly women get naked all the time.  So they had to wait until they found this story of one good-looking woman who went to jail.  Because then people will watch.  Who's not going to watch?  It was the same thing they did in the 70s with all the, you know... 
[03:32:00]  Blaxploitation.  Blaxploitation and chicks in prison movies and all that stuff.  You weren't going to watch a chicks in prison movie if it was full of ugly bitches.  No.  Certainly not.  Let me go to Henry in North Carolina.  What's up?  Hey, you know, everybody keeps on talking about this, want to be a cop.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to be a cop, is there?  No, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be a cop.  There's something wrong with acting like you have some kind of authority of your neighborhood.  Like, if you just sit at home wanting to be a cop, that's fine. 
[03:32:30]  Like, I sit at home wanting to be a lot of things.  But I don't act like I'm that thing.  Like, I don't try to take control of situations and try to assert my authority over people when I don't have any and all that.  That's where it becomes an issue.  Wanting to be a cop is fine.  I think it's an honorable thing.  If you want to be a cop and then you go through training and then you become a police officer, that's beautiful.  But wanting to be a cop, not getting on the police force, and then just acting like one is not honorable.  Okay, but was he not trying to get to training to be an officer? 
[03:33:00]  I mean, I'm confused here.  Did he not go to school and start trying to shut the education to be a cop?  I don't know what he did, but I know he wasn't a cop.  Well, no, he wasn't a cop.  I mean, that woman, you know, it just keeps on sounding like being a cop is a bad thing.  No, being a cop is a great thing.  Pretending you're a cop is a bad thing.  Okay, well...  The dude's not a cop.  I understand he wants to be a cop, but when little kids dress up as cowboys, they're not actually cowboys. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, yes, I understand that.  And if they start trying to do whatever cowboys do, if they start trying to get involved with shootouts at the OK Corral,  they're going to end up getting themselves in trouble because they're not real cowboys.  Okay, just the way, Kevin, you know what I'm saying?  They want to be a cop, and yet they think that's a bad thing.  Look, if you're a wannabe fireman, okay, and you don't go through training, you just buy a red suit and a helmet,  and you run into a burning building, you're going to get burned alive.  And I'm not going to feel bad for you because you're a wannabe fireman. 
[03:34:00]  If you sit at home wanting to be a fireman and then go through the steps to become one, that's beautiful.  But if you just act like you already are one, that's not beautiful at all.  That's ugly.  Okay, I guess y'all are looking at it different ways than I do.  You feel me?  That's the difference.  It's like, the fact that a person wants to be a cop, that's great.  If they go become a cop, that's even better.  But if you act like a cop before you are one, or without being one, there's nothing good about that whatsoever. 
[03:34:30]  Okay, well, I just look at it the way it's like a bad thing to want to be a cop, the way it was said so many times.  No, I don't think it's a bad thing to want to be a cop.  But I'm glad we clarified that.  All right, thank you, Sam.  All right, buddy.  Pete in Texas.  Hello.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, how y'all doing?  I just listened to y'all's show, and I just picked up a piece about when y'all was talking about women in prisons.  Well, I'm a retired prison warden out of Gatesville, Texas. 
[03:35:00]  I live in Cut and Shoot, Texas now.  Yeah.  I wanted to tell y'all, you'd be surprised how many pretty women are locked up to Texas penal system now.  Were you a warden in a female prison?  Yes, I was.  I started off in the prison in 1982 when I was 18 years old.  Wow.  Came up through the ranks.  I didn't get college educated.  Back then, you had turnkeys.  And back then, we have 126 prison units in the state of Texas, and we house over 220,000 inmates.  And like I said, I started in the mid-'80s, came up through the ranks. 
[03:35:30]  I'm not a college-educated man now.  Nowadays, all these prison wards come out to college.  Now, I came up from the bottom and went to the top.  Started from the bottom.  Now, you're here.  Now, let me ask you, is it terrifying when you're 18 years old to be in a prison and, like, you're supposed to be security?  Well...  Or not security, but you're supposed to be...  You're the guy who's in charge of controlling these, you know, violent felons?  Well, I don't...  Now, when I started off, I didn't start off in Gatesville Women's Prison.  Yeah.  I started off in the McCullough Unit, which was a maximum security prison. 
[03:36:00]  And I was on the host squad.  I was on a horse, toting a shotgun or a .223 AR-15.  Okay.  Took the host squad out every day.  And these, you know, Mexican mafia are down.  Some of the most ruthless, hard killers there was.  And hell, yeah.  I was scared of, man.  Terrifying.  I was scared of a $5 whore on nickel knife.  So, when you start being...  When you're the warden of a female prison, is there sex with the inmates?  Is that possible?  Yeah.  You know what?  I gotta tell you, it does happen. 
[03:36:30]  I'll tell you a story, and this is no bullshit.  Tell me.  Had a guard that's in prison right now.  He was having sex with a female inmate.  Yeah.  After he got done with his business, you know, the old girl wiped her backside.  He put that tissue off to her lawyer.  And now he's sitting in prison.  And yes, it does happen.  No fucking way!  So, she saved his cum and gave it to her lawyer?  She wiped her ass with a piece of tissue.  Oh.  Wrote a letter to her lawyer.  Regular old letter.  Put that tissue off in that letter. 
[03:37:00]  And just thing you know, we got the DOJ coming down in the damn Federal Lakes.  Praise nine kinds of hell, man.  And oh yeah, the hell boys in prison.  But to answer your question, women in prison, they nasty.  They stick their tampons to the damn walls.  They are nastier than men.  They're harder to do.  I'll tell you what.  I'd rather be in a maximum security prison with a bunch of Mexican mafia threatening to  slit my throat than in any medium security women prison.  Dealing with women prisoners, they all bleed at the same time. 
[03:37:30]  They're emotional as hell.  Right, I guess, yeah, because when women live together, their cycles start going on the same time.  And so, I guess, what, every 30 days, you got a whole prison full of prisoners on their period.  Are you there?  Oh, we lost Pete.  Nicole's here.  Who is that guy?  He used to be a...  Oh, he's back.  He's back.  Are you there, Pete?  Yes, sir, I am.  Oh, okay.  I didn't hear you.  We were just talking about all the women getting their periods at the same time in prison. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  And they'll cut each other and cut each other up and this and that.  But now, I was more of a hands-on.  I couldn't stand polishing my chair with my ass in my office all day.  I was out there on the run.  I was out there in the fields once in a while.  Did you ever bang any female prisoners?  Tell me the truth.  No, sir, I haven't.  But I've got knife scars and punch holes in my body from head to toe.  Women cut you?  No, not the women, the men.  I was going to say a woman on her period will definitely cut you.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe. 
[03:38:30]  Now, y'all got to understand.  My last five years, I was awarded to women's prison.  Now, like I said, women are a bit more...  You never even got a blowjob at the women's prison?  Nothing.  Can I tell you a little secret?  My brother owns strip clubs in Dallas, Houston.  So if I wanted to knock off a nut, I'd go over to get one of his clubs and take care of that.  I've never been married.  I'm 51 years old.  I don't have kids and I ain't never been married.  Don't plan to ever get married.  Why buy the cow if you can get the milk for free?  You're a smart hire.  Because I think that should be... 
[03:39:00]  When you're hiring a warden for a women's prison, they would say,  what's the easiest way for you to get a nut off?  And if it's as easy as it is for Pete, I'd hire Pete.  Because I'd be like, well, yeah, he's going to go fuck one of the strippers.  He's not going to waste his time.  Where would this guard have sex with the prisoners?  Oh, man.  Man, let me tell y'all something.  Yeah, please do.  Let me tell y'all something.  Y'all got women trustees who roam around.  You got what's called pipe chases.  You see, unlike the prisons on the East Coast where there's these great big, evil, huge stone buildings, 
[03:39:30]  there's mostly one huge building, like your wall pool in that upstate prison in New York.  They're not like that.  These, you must understand, Texas prisons sit usually on hundreds, sometimes a couple thousand acres.  There's no AC, none of that bullshit.  They're individual metal buildings.  And we've got what's called in the main building is a pipe chase.  So in between these cells, there might be maybe a hundred yards of cells. 
[03:40:00]  In between the cells is the pipe chases.  And as for the sewers, the toilets, and all that,  well, them old boys will run off them damn inmates in them damn pipe chases.  Like where all the shit goes and everything?  Yeah, but it's in pipes.  You ain't gonna smell.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, gotcha.  Those guards get more ass than a city bus, bitch.  The guards do.  Oh, hell yeah.  And it happens on a regular basis.  How else do you think they get their weed and their cell phones and all that other shit? 
[03:40:30]  I know how they do that because I watched the show on Netflix.  And they show the guy, like, he gets blowjobs from the prisoners,  and then he gives them the pills they want.  You know, I mean, my philosophy was this, and y'all forgive me for saying this.  I do.  I didn't give a frog's fat ass what my damn guards did.  So long as it didn't cause static for me,  I don't need the damn attorney general coming down from Huntsville 
[03:41:00]  reading my asshole out with a stool bud.  Right.  I mean, I don't need the aggravation.  The minute, though, that a prisoner is wiping splooge off her ass and giving it to her lawyer,  now you have yourself a problem.  Absolutely.  This is what my problem I had.  These old boys come down from Huntsville.  And I had to go through all kinds of sequesters, all kinds of freak, all kinds of...  Now, they didn't read my ass, but, you know, basically what I had to do, they came to me.  I had to go get that guard.  We arrested him on the spot, stripped him of his badge, stripped him of his cuffs, and all that. 
[03:41:30]  They pretty much took him off.  Now, I didn't get much static.  I read the deposition.  I read the report.  I read all that shit, and I had to sign off on that shit.  And it was pretty much cut dry.  Now, I have to tell you right now, I'll tell you,  in the course of a seven-day work week,  I probably got, on average, 15 to 25 accusations about some old guard-run dick on my ass.  Now, 9.9 out of 10 is bullshit. 
[03:42:00]  Right.  But there is that point, there is that point one...  You got a 10th.  Yes, that's right.  Right.  That's right.  And, you know what, I mean, it happens.  But if I could have done it all over again, all over again,  I would have much rather stayed in a man's high maximum security unit like McConnell,  and sat on top of that horse with my AR-15 or my shotgun,  with my little old cowboy hat on, watching them ho squads turn dirty. 
[03:42:30]  You tell me, is there more lesbian activity in a women's prison,  or more gay activity in a men's prison?  Look, you know what?  What?  That's a real good question.  I got a real good answer.  There is more carpet munching than there is cocksucking.  Good to know.  I wouldn't think that.  I would.  I would.  Oh, dear.  Let me tell you something now.  I got a story for you all.  Yeah.  Well, real quick, what's the carpet munching to cocksucking ratio? 
[03:43:00]  I would say, well, you must understand, I can't speak for any other prison system but Texas,  but the only one that's getting their shit packed in the male prisons is the punks.  Oh.  This shit about, you know, young kids coming in, getting stripped down,  and cracked open like a shot, like a double-barrel shot,  and getting some dick right up their ass.  Those stories.  But, like, a Sam Roberts would probably have a lot of trouble.  Well, I don't know, but I don't know anything about that. 
[03:43:30]  But I just know.  You go to, I mean, and you've got to understand, once you hit a prison, like I said,  a punk is going to get punked.  Sure.  As soon as a white boy comes in, the AB or the AR or one of them white supremacist groups  is going to pick them up, because you have no choice.  I'm going to tell you this right now.  Like, anybody coming into a Texas prison system,  unless you gang up with a crew, let me tell you something,  you should forget them.  You ain't going to lie. 
[03:44:00]  You're going to wind up with a damn Big Ten stuffed up behind your ear.  Oh, Jesus.  So what would I do then?  Let me tell you.  I'm entering a prison, let's say.  Now, I look like a white guy, right?  But I have black person hair.  Yes, you do.  So where do I go?  Well, let me ask you.  What may I show you?  Italian, Irish.  I know you're from the East Coast.  Yeah, I'm from the East Coast, and I'm completely white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.  I'm telling you, French, Dutch, English. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, that's all right.  Okay.  You're Hans 57.  All right.  You're going to get picked up by the ABT or the LR.  All right.  Or the NLR.  Nazi lowriders, Aryan Brotherhood, Aryan Brotherhood of Texas.  You're going to pair up with one of them three.  You're going to have no choice but to pair up with one of them three.  What if I tell them I disagree with some of their political ideologies, but I appreciate  them as people?  They're going to tell you I hope you appreciate me running this fucking big pen right behind 
[03:45:00]  your ears to wipe your eyes through the blood red.  That's right.  That's where they like putting those big pens, behind the ears.  Okay.  Okay.  You know, that's about it.  But like I said, back to your question, there's more carpet munching than anything.  Right.  There really is.  Yeah.  Girls are a lot more liberal with that.  And, you know, it's so rampant.  You know, you get, you know, old girl gets caught going down on her girlfriend.  Me?  I might, you know, I might keep her out the commissary line for a week. 
[03:45:30]  I might take her visitation.  I mean, you know what?  I'm not a hard ass.  I came up to the reg.  I wasn't college educated.  You know, I came up to the reg.  How long are you watching?  You catch somebody, you catch a girl going down on another girl.  How long are you watching before you break it up?  Is she ugly or is she pretty?  She's a good looking girl.  I don't want to let them go.  Well, I might let them go.  I'm going to take them to eat a Snickers bar.  That's kind of you.  Get a snack for yourself and just enjoy the show for a little bit. 
[03:46:00]  Why not?  Who gets off on that of them damn youngsters?  The guards, the new boots fresh coming in.  They get a kick out of that.  But like anything else.  Yeah, but these guys come in, young, dumb, and full of cum.  They're busting on some prisoner's back.  And all of a sudden, that splooge rag is going straight to a lawyer.  It's not safe.  And let me tell you something.  It's not the new boots coming in that are knocking dust from the inmate's ass.  It's the guards that have been there a while who've got comfortable with the system,  who can work the system like the inmate. 
[03:46:30]  It is not.  You get it, Nicole?  Oh, I understand.  Okay.  It is not the new boots.  The new boots are, well, man, them new boots are scared shitless, man.  They're more scared than the Catholic girl on her first date and a handjob with a reach-around.  She would be nervous.  She'd be terrified.  What's the worst thing that happened to you in your time in prison?  Oh, that's a good one.  You know, and this guy, go through when you're a warden, when you're a guard,  the worst thing that happened to you.  All right. 
[03:47:00]  I would say, oh, man.  So many things.  A lot of bad things.  Well, no, there's a few of them in my head running around right now.  Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I was on this unit called the Darrington Unit.  It's outside of Houston, Texas, oh, about 55 miles down there by Freeport, south of Texas.  Now, let me tell y'all something.  That Darrington Unit is old.  It looks like the prisons y'all got up there. 
[03:47:30]  And, you know, there ain't no AC.  There ain't no nothing.  Right.  It's hot because we don't put no AC in it.  Well, a riot kicked off one time between the Mexican Mafia and the Texas Syndicate.  Oh, boy.  And at that time, I was just a sergeant.  And, you know, to be honest with you, they drug test prison guards pretty much.  The only drugs we ever got to fuck with was steroids.  And we liked our steroids because that was the only thing we could do.  Because you got prisoners in there lifting weights, taking that damn creatine, 
[03:48:00]  and that boy's getting big, so the only thing we could do is get one up on them.  Start, you know, going down to Mexico.  Start juicing.  Juice our shit.  Yeah.  Bet that, what was that, that Greg Valentino looked like a damn,  looked like a damn beginner at some point.  Anyway, that riot kicked off.  I caught a fucking screwdriver behind the head.  Oh, Jesus.  I saw on my gut that looks like a, that I got, you know what, they take,  they take a big razor blade. 
[03:48:30]  They get the blade out.  They take a toothbrush.  And they melt that toothbrush, and they set that blade inside that hot, hot plastic on the end of that toothbrush.  Right.  I caught one of them in the gut, probably about 22 inches around.  Looked like a shark bite.  Oh, my God.  And that's just like a shaving razor.  That's right.  Wow.  And I caught one, and I caught that same day, I caught a scar on the leg at the same time.  So you got a screwdriver to the back of the head, a shark bite done by a Bic razor blade, 
[03:49:00]  and then you got caught on your back, too?  That's rough.  Why don't they just tell all the prisoners that they have to have beards?  I'm sorry?  Just tell every prisoner he has to have a beard.  No razors for you.  You can't be trusted.  Well, no, there's a problem with that, Dan, because then you're going to have the life  and everything else.  They don't want to put them in line no more.  No, they got racks now.  But no, the funny thing about it was, I was in the middle of that mix with a bunch of other  guards.  And when this shit was going down, the only thing I had was a billy club and a fucking 
[03:49:30]  fireplace brick that I got my hands on.  Yeah, I shit you not.  How the fuck?  Just hitting people with bricks?  To this day, and it's funny because before I retired, even when I went to the women's  unit, you know, they say, they call me Petey Bricks, and they say, you know, the one  of your Petey Bricks, and to this day, I cannot tell you where that fucking brick came from,  but all I know is about 15 guards, and I would say, man, I couldn't tell you how many 
[03:50:00]  inmates, but it started off with 15 guards, because that's how money was in that block.  And let me tell you something, when that shit went down, when it was all set, I don't  know how I ended up, I had the billy club, because I went in with that.  How I wound it up with that damn fireplace brick, I don't know.  I mean, it came off part of the building, the red brick building, but I'll tell you  what, I was working at, shit, I threw the billy club down, I went down, I had the billy 
[03:50:30]  club off to another youngster, and another youngster guard, and I went to work with that  fucking brick, but when it was all set, I didn't know what the hell happened to me.  It looked like someone staged a fucking cockfight in the middle of this hill, and when I got  done, I looked down, and I was covered in blood, and I didn't think it was mine until I reached  the back of the head, and stuck my little finger finger in that hole, and then when  I had butted my fucking shirt, my insides was filleted like a 20 pound fucking catfish. 
[03:51:00]  Jesus Christ.  Well, Petey Bricks, I'm glad you made it through.  Obviously, it didn't hurt your brain any.  I'll do it all again.  Hell, I retired two years ago and went to work in the oil fields down in South Texas, and  do I miss it?  You are a man amongst men.  All right, Petey.  I appreciate it.  You can call back any time, Petey Bricks.  Y'all take care, man.  I'll talk to you later.  That was an awesome call.  Petey Bricks is the fucking man.  What'd you know about Petey Bricks, Nicole?  That was intense.  Yeah.  I did not know I was going to walk into such a interesting conversation. 
[03:51:30]  All I did is talk about the Orange is the New Black show.  Yeah.  And then Petey Bricks calls in and is like, let me tell you something.  You want to tell me who Petey Bricks is?  He's a guy.  He used to be a warden.  Okay.  In a Texas women's prison.  Okay.  And then he had all these prison stories to tell me.  I've never heard of him before in my life.  I have not either.  Except for today.  But now I know.  Oh, Marshall in Texas wants to represent the great state.  What's up, Marshall?  Hey, Prime James, Sam Roberts, broadcast viewer, professor at Al. 
[03:52:00]  That's right.  Hey, man.  This is giving us a bad name.  Most of us from Texas are nearly this classy.  All right.  Good.  Marshall cleared that up.  He doesn't want everybody to think that everybody in Texas is that classy.  Have you seen Orange is the New Black yet?  No.  I just keep totally blowing it.  But I'm going to watch it.  I have so much stuff to watch.  Well, I hope that a show like this and a call from a guy like Petey Bricks will remind  you, Nicole, from the morning mashup, maybe go easy on the partying sometimes.  Yeah.  Because a girl like you. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  How do you think you would do in prison?  I would die.  You think so?  First day.  I don't know.  You got a little temper on you.  You don't think the violent side of you would come out a little bit?  I mean, I think I'd have no choice for it to come out.  Yeah.  But I think I would be super scared that I was getting eaten alive in every sense of  the word.  Yeah.  I think that I would definitely shave my head before I went in.  You would.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Because that looks like your hair is very friendly right now.  And it looks ethnically ambiguous.  Right.  Which, outside of the bars, is very in vogue right now. 
[03:53:00]  Right.  Inside the bars, not as much.  Right.  Not quite in style.  So I'd shave my head.  I'd try to look as lily white as possible.  Okay.  I would join the Aryans right off the bat.  Wow.  And I'd probably have to give myself to them physically.  Yeah.  Well, you have to.  You need protection.  And I'd be.  No, you know, physically.  Like, give them my flower.  And then you would have their protection because you gave yourself.  Right.  I'd be willing to give it up, like, a couple times.  You'd be their prag?  Yeah.  I'd be their prag for a minute.  I would, too.  I would not be scared to give myself.  But then, you know what we'd do? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  I'd look around, and I'd figure out mentally who was the, like, no offense to you,  E-Rock, but I'd find the E-Rock of the Aryan Nation.  What the fuck?  And I'd be like, I'd start doing my little E-Rock jokes at that guy.  And they'd be like, oh, yeah, Sam, you're right, da-da-da.  Yeah.  And eventually.  You'd get shanked in the shower.  I would start climbing up the ladder until, yes, Aryan E-Rock comes and shakes me in the  shower.  Crazy.  You've got such a plan already.  Yeah, but I think I could do it.  I think I could make my way after I, you know, gave myself to them a few times. 
[03:54:00]  Right.  I feel like I could get at least halfway up the ladder just, you know, by talking and being  stupid.  That's a bold statement.  I think so.  I hope you never are faced with that decision.  But I would have to give myself up.  Yeah.  Yes.  Who does Nicole align with?  Because depending where you go to prison, I can't imagine much of the tribe being in  prison.  Yeah, because I'm ethnically ambiguous as well.  Can you do a Puerto Rican accent?  Let me hear it.  Also, can I be part of your group?  Okay, that is not going to work out.  That's almost Hindu.  Yeah, I think I heard that in 7-Eleven.  I can't do any accent. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  Zero.  It does.  I think, yeah, that is a little bit Apu Nahasapimapetalan.  Yeah.  Well, you do have the new Irish last name.  I do.  So you should be all right.  I don't know, man.  I just would be screwed.  I would just close my eyes and just...  Because you can't join the white group.  I don't know.  Do the girls have the same groups as the guys?  Yeah.  Do you have the same...  I watched Orange is the New Black, and they all have different tables.  You have to side with your race.  It doesn't seem like it's as violent, women's prison.  Okay.  Again.  But it's very clicky.  Because I watch the TV show, so I know. 
[03:55:00]  But it is separated by race.  And you can't hang out with the black chicks, because you're definitely not black.  No.  But I am super brown.  You might end up with The Others.  The Others?  Is there a group called The Others?  Yeah.  There's probably one Indian chick and three Asian chicks and you.  Like when you fill out one of those Scantron things?  Other.  Yeah.  There is a group called Other?  How do you classify yourself?  Other.  I prefer not to.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  When you get to prison, this is how you really make a splash. 
[03:55:30]  Okay.  When you get to prison, they'll say, well, who are you going to be hanging out with?  And you'll say this, I don't see color.  I see people.  Right.  I'm sure that would go over well.  So I'm going to get to know everybody and just see who I have the most in common with.  I doubt that.  I just, I don't even want to think about this.  The fact that you have like a full on plan that you thought out.  Well, I was, first of all, I was obsessed.  I think every guy does.  You have to be.  You know, and you know when you developed it, when Oz was on.  Yep.  Because I was, were you obsessed with that show? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  I was obsessed.  I've never seen it.  With the show Oz.  Sam might be the preacher that gets buried in the wall alive.  Yeah, but for a minute, I would have a nice little congregation for myself.  For a hot minute, I would have a nice little congregation.  You'd have your own little wrestling faction and then they'd bury you in the wall.  You'd be preaching?  Yeah.  You'd be preaching.  I could see that.  You know who that preacher was?  Who?  Mr. Luke Perry.  Really?  That's right.  God, he's so dreamy.  Yeah, I saw his wiener.  In the show?  In the show.  He shows it.  Yeah, oh yeah.  Him and Jason Biggs into showing their wieners.  Yep, yep. 
[03:56:30]  Jason Biggs doesn't show his wiener in this show, though.  No, he doesn't.  It's a female prison drama.  And that's how I was telling E-Rock, it's about time somebody made a female prison show.  Because me and E-Rock, we'd be sitting there watching every episode of Oz over and over  again and just realize, all right, we're going to have to deal with the fact that we're  going to look at a lot of penis.  Yeah.  Now, with the women's prison show, not only do you get prison drama, but it's like hot  women.  Yeah, are you getting, like, I'm going to start watching the show.  Are you getting full-on nudity? 
[03:57:00]  Titties.  Yeah.  You're a lot of titties.  Are they showing a little of what's going on down below?  Yeah, there was a whole episode about a picture of a vagina, and it kept showing the picture.  I've got to watch the show.  It is.  There's a lot to it that makes it seem like, like, when there's stuff like that, like  E-Rock said, in the shows, it reminds you that you're not watching network TV.  Right.  Like, this is like, then you feel like, okay, yeah, this is the real deal.  But are they nice titties?  Because I would imagine in prison you wouldn't see so many nice titties.  You'd see a lot of, like, deflated titties or, like, gross titties.  Well, you got Laura Prepon from that 70s show. 
[03:57:30]  Right.  Who is the redhead in that show, but now she's, like, got black hair.  Right.  And she's got, as they say on the Opie and Anthony show, big and heavies.  Big and heavies.  Nice.  Okay.  And then the girl who's the star, I can't remember her name, the blonde.  Yeah, she's really hot.  Ridiculously hot.  And she shows her.  Yeah, I can't remember.  She was in a Zac Efron movie.  But, yeah, she's ridiculous hot.  And she shows everything.  I don't know if I've seen her vagina.  I'm sure you will eventually.  But I've definitely seen her tits. 
[03:58:00]  But that's the whole premise of the show is that she's like a fish out of water.  Right.  So then there's a lot of unattractive women.  But that's, I think, what they were looking for is figuring out, because it's based on a true story.  So they have to find this story of the good-looking woman in prison.  And then we got on this.  And that's why, what's his name called up?  Petey Bricks called up to say, let me tell you, there's a lot of hot women in Texas prison.  Did you see the show before you interviewed, Jason?  No.  I wish I had. 
[03:58:30]  Me, too.  You know what I said?  I didn't realize that they had already, like, released it on Netflix.  I thought it was about to be released.  And I know they released all the episodes.  I think it was just released Thursday, right?  Okay, but when I was interviewed.  And that was the day we interviewed him, by the way, Thursday.  When I interviewed him, I was like, so I watched the trailer.  And he was like, oh, really?  You watched the whole trailer?  Thanks.  Yeah.  Like, he was legit annoyed with me.  You know what you could have done?  Like, the smallest amount of prep for your interview, and then you would have known when the show came out.  Overrated.  You think so?  We had a great interview.  It was funny.  He tortured me the whole time about it. 
[03:59:00]  Probably wasn't as good as mine.  Probably not.  Mike in Ohio.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I'm, uh...  I did some time out in California.  How was it?  I was rough.  Mostly, you get, uh...  If you're white, it depends on whether you got a cellmate that's Aryan Brotherhood or a Nazi lowrider.  Peckerwoods.  What's a Peckerwood?  You got the...  Peckerwood is a white guy who's down for his shit. 
[03:59:30]  Down for his shit.  Oh, I get it.  Like, he's going to take a Peckerwood.  I don't want to get Peckerwood.  I would get it.  I would...  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  We're running out of time.  I would probably get a swastika tattoo to survive in prison.  Don't say that!  To survive in prison.  Oh, solely for prison.  Yeah.  I mean, it's permanent.  It's permanent.  Whatever.  So you would forget about me in two seconds, the second you went into the glamour.  Oh, you're Jewish.  Thanks.  Yeah, but if it's like, oh, I can either be friends with Nicole or these Aryans could eat  me.  You might have to do it to survive, Nicole.  Yeah.  That's understandable.  I just like to... 
[04:00:00]  Are all guys...  Like, is there anyone who isn't having...  Like, are there people that go into prison and don't have sex anymore?  Like, do you ever go in and, like, not become gay?  Well, that's what the dude said.  He said it happens way more with females.  I'm sure there are men who do not have anal sex in prison, but they're not the size of Sam  Roberts.  Oh, right.  They're men who can defend themselves.  They're a man who, if somebody came up to them and said, I'm going to fuck you, and  they said, no, you're not, they would take them seriously.  Like, if I looked at somebody and went, no, you're not, they'd be like, I'm definitely  going to.  Not in that voice. 
[04:00:30]  No, you're not.  You are not.  You will not.  And then a fist to the face.  Right.  Like, oh.  You will not do that to me.  Actually, they probably wouldn't punch me because they probably like me, like, saying that  while they were doing it.  You have a lot of confidence, Sam.  Keep talking, pretty.  You have a lot of jail confidence.  I'd be the prettiest boy in prison.  100%.  100%.  That smile, those sparkling eyes, that charm.  That's right.  That's right.  Now, I'm actually going to put the Jason, I have a Jason Biggs clip on YouTube later  today.  If you're listening to the replay, it might already be up, so lucky you. 
[04:01:00]  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  What's going on with you, Nicole?  Anything you want to plug?  No, not really.  Just follow me up, mashupnicole.  I just missed you.  I just needed a little QT with Sam Roberts.  I love when you're here.  I love it.  I love to be here.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.
