<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Patrice O'Neal guest-hosting alongside Dante Nero.  The show begins with the typical antagonistic banter between the hosts, filled with fart jokes and weight-related insults. Patrice expresses his skepticism about being asked to fill in, questioning Opie and Anthony's motives. He also observes the frequently contentious relationship between E-Rock and Danny.  A substantial portion of the broadcast is devoted to a discussion about race and racism in America, ignited by Patrice's recent controversial on-air racial tirade.  This sparks a debate on the “plight of the white man,” with callers offering diverse and often conflicting viewpoints on systemic racism and feelings of disenfranchisement.  The conversation is punctuated by frequent use of racial slurs and offensive language from both Patrice and callers.  Patrice connects his experiences playing violent video games like *Call of Duty: World at War* to his views on race and war, noting the lack of diverse war representations in games and its impact on his mindset.  He also links his pornography consumption to his emotional state.  Numerous callers contribute to the heated and often confrontational discussion about race, reparations for slavery, and the role of media figures like Al Sharpton.

The show transitions into a discussion about the Mafia's influence on hip-hop culture, followed by a comedic retelling of the *Scarface* plot.  A black caller expresses concern about the perceived silence of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson on racial issues. The hosts then promote Jim Norton's book and appearances.  A debate ensues regarding E-Harmony's settlement to create a website for gay and lesbian users, leading to a lengthy discussion on the definition of "gay," the gay rights movement, and Proposition 8.  The hosts express their opinions on the issue, comparing it to other forms of oppression, and discuss the perceived aggression of some gay rights protestors.  A humorous segment depicts a fictional Patrice O'Neal takeover of the show, involving the firing of white staff and the introduction of strippers and pitbull fighting.  Patrice O'Neal then joins the show, engaging in a comedic exchange with Opie and Anthony filled with racial humor and anecdotes about his interactions with police. The conversation returns to Proposition 8 and the complexities of race and religion within the black community, with Patrice offering his perspective on why black people may not have voted for the proposition and comparing the religious and homosexual experiences of white and black people. The discussion broadens to include other minority groups, such as Latinos and Asians, and their perceived place in the hierarchy of oppression in America,  including a discussion of internal divisions within the Latino community and a caller challenging Patrice's assertions about Asian and Latino unity. Patrice shares a humorous anecdote involving Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart.  The show concludes this segment with a discussion of useless iPhone apps.

A heated argument erupts between contributors Tony and Pat Duffy regarding their respective contributions to the show and who deserves to be hired first.  Tony emphasizes his behind-the-scenes work, while Pat Duffy highlights his outrageous on-air stunts (stapling his forehead, brushing his teeth with dog feces, confronting a litterer). The argument escalates, involving personal insults and threats of physical violence.  Other studio personnel, including Sam and the hosts, participate by throwing objects at Pat Duffy. The hosts describe the argument as "amazing radio," comparing it to the "Thrilla in Manila."  The segment concludes with unresolved conflict and further verbal sparring, including numerous tangents about other contributors, past interns, and even the reproductive habits of honeybees and robins.

The show features a discussion of the strained relationship between interns Pat Duffy and Sam, with Pat expressing a desire to physically assault Sam, detailing a violent fantasy.  Sam humorously describes how he anticipates Pat's attacks.  The hosts stage a "confrontation" with the security guard, Poe, acting as a buffer.  The tension diminishes, ending in an awkward handshake.  The conversation shifts to a recent trip to Japan by an intern, featuring humorous and vulgar anecdotes.  The segment includes a bit with "Fuck Twat the Clown," delivering crude jokes, and a dispute between intern Lily and Danny over missing water, escalating into a personal confrontation.  Finally, a playful and vulgar discussion surrounds a video shoot starring intern Lily and an asexual photographer.

A dispute between Danny and Lily over missing water escalates into a heated argument filled with profanity. Ron, an intern, confirms Lily's demanding behavior.  The argument shifts to Lily's perceived entitled attitude.  Guests Jay Moore and callers attempt to mediate, with Jay calling both Danny and Lily "fucking fags" and commenting on Lily's attire.  The conversation veers into personal insults, discussions of sexual tension between Lily and Danny, assessments of Lily's physical attractiveness,  a running joke about Lily’s uneven nostrils, and a graphic discussion of Karen Carpenter's death and eating disorder. The segment concludes with more insults, speculation on the pair's potential for "angry sex," and a discussion of unpaid staff members, including Lily, Ron, and Fez. The show ends with a Carpenters song.

[00:09:30]  for hot call of duty for if they want people to love they got to stop making video games where you could  kill like call of duty for now i started and then i realized how i feel as the games i'm playing in  july i was feeling really peaceful and i was into golf i was playing tiger woods golf and uh and quite  frankly dude golf is a fun game i probably wouldn't play it live right but playing it on the game was 
[00:10:00]  very relaxing it was cool it was strategic right you know i had a certain kind of respect for it but  lately i've been playing uh war games and it started out with um i don't know if you remember this game  called uh metal slug no never played that metal slug is a it's a capcom game it's a cheap little  army game remember metal slug and you just you know like you fall out the sky and then a letter h  will fall out the sky for a heavy machine gun and then a letter oh yeah yeah yeah kind of like uh 
[00:10:30]  like like the old contra contra or commando it was a better contra yeah and you know you can upgrade  your machine gun and and when the guys died they kind of went and poofed into smoke yeah and they  made it sound like when they died and then if you get killed they're standing there happy that you  died and then when you you float back down with a with a parachute and then they go again you know  i'm saying so i'm playing that but then i started moving because i stopped playing uh xbox for a while 
[00:11:00]  and started playing uh psp and that was on psp but then i went back to playstation  i mean we're back to uh xbox so i'm playing uh i'm playing this game called brothers in arms  and you played that yeah brothers in arms is interesting it it's a it's a world war ii game  which i don't understand see this country's crazy because i don't understand why no other wars  represented uh but world war one or two no we're on video games only world war ii there's i played 
[00:11:30]  there's no there was a civil war game once it stunk like i never played a worse video game  than the civil war game it just it almost was was fun and i'm like we're and first of all i was like  we're the black dudes well i think the problem with that one i think i know which one you're  talking about it's called civil war well i think it was the developer was the problem with that one  because i think the history channel actually put that one it was the history channel's civil war  war so it was not historically correct but for some reason and they don't have here's what they 
[00:12:00]  don't have either they don't have a korean uh war game they don't have uh eight they don't have any  war we lost they don't have an 1812 and they don't have a revolutionary war with christmas addicts  they don't have they don't have you can play as christmas guy we're talking about this country's war  yeah the only war that's really good war game that's really good i think there was one vietnam  game i played it wasn't great they had a uh i think uh iraq yeah with the swift boats and stuff 
[00:12:30]  like that iraq was represented once that was it was really good that was it was operation desert  storm right no but it was recon no that stunk that was first that one stunk it's one where in the  beginning you get cured you're a hostage and they actually kill you in the in the thing and then  they do this the one where you do the helicopter and you see you know that the helicopter where they  go yeah with the uh and then you see little what's supposed to be little arrows running around 
[00:13:00]  and you just blow them up with the night vision you didn't play that game well anyway that game was  pretty good that game was pretty good but this brothers in arms i played and i thought this was pretty  good okay and the only thing about brothers in arms it was kind of easy because they had a thing on it  where you can hide behind anything the peak behind you can peak and then come out and just sit there  for hours until you just pick off yeah everybody one by one and it was decent and uh it was okay and i i 
[00:13:30]  didn't like it that much in the to begin with because i don't like any game that forces you  to to to look at the story like i don't like any games that force you to look at like you can't just  push the x button right and go you know it's done it's yeah you can't oh you oh you can't hold  the whole story past the right brothers and moms the stories about this magical gun and it's 
[00:14:00]  ghosts and it stinks but then i'm playing call of duty for almost all night and we're talking about  last night dude here's the thing how can you had fought in a war and not been racist how could i'm  playing this game dude you call of duty 4 takes place in a pow camp in japan and the guys escape  that's the first scene dude nips in the wire do if and you you know you can say that not even i'm i 
[00:14:30]  i don't think in the wire ends in the wire chips in the wire i'm just repeating the stupid game  in the wire no no okay i won't say it again then but that asian n-word cannot be said  are you serious all right it was dumped but yeah uh you can say asian n-word 
[00:15:00]  don't you mean no call it it's call of duty yeah don't you mean the new one the world at war  duty world at war yeah because you keep saying four it's the new one it is it's four it's the  fourth one isn't it no it's five it's actually five it's five yeah so okay so call of duty world  at war let me let me apologize so call of duty world war the racism in that game that you get but the  racism you feel as you play in it it it it makes you respect anybody fighting in a war because the 
[00:15:30]  only way you live is to think racist because you're sitting there and they're coming out of the bushes  and you just in the game you say to yourself in the wire  n's in the wire  n's in the wire n words in the wire  c words in the wire g's in the g words in the wire 
[00:16:00]  and you have to you the way you play that game and they keep coming out dude these games man these games  you would think that they can't get realer they got here's this what this game did  that i've never seen any other video game do is as you're fighting your guy next to you say you and  your boy next to you not your boy no no i'm not playing online i'm just playing the game right so you 
[00:16:30]  and your boy that's helping you fight there's 20 uh uh ends in the wire ends in the wire coming  and you're if your boy gets shot in the head you see him get shot in the head right you still got  to deal with 20 of them right it's not like the game adjusts because he's dead right the game keeps  playing as hard as it was playing just like real war dude right and you just sitting there i'm up all  night playing this game and it just it makes you racist just so so to get back to the ultimate 
[00:17:00]  point of this okay is where make video games where i'm counting we're going clouds like i'm sitting  up there upset playing this video game then i start thinking here's where my mind goes where  are the other wars this war we officially won where's the wars that we lost why aren't we playing  any how dirty is that that gets real dirty well who wants that you know the end if you're going to 
[00:17:30]  put out a video game what is the end of world war ii a mystery no but you like the feeling of a win i  like watching a good blowout in a game well i actually think that the video game is not like  in the civil war one that you know if you could play the south if they make a civil good civil war  game yeah okay and my thoughts of a good civil war game is this is if you send someone back in time 
[00:18:00]  somebody's gonna steal it from me if you send somebody back in time with just a desert eagle no  extra guns just one desert eagle just a desert eagle or or maybe some type of uh like a some kind of  ray gun right that you have to find like you charge it by uh gold or you charge it by doubloons or  whatever it's back in 1812 or um slaves or black charge it with slaves  you charge the gun with slave spit 
[00:18:30]  come on cleophus  spitting this gun but i would love to see that actual do you understand why stunt brain i'm so  wired up about certain things man because my mind i'm looking to relax yeah i'm looking to love i'm  looking to forgive i'm looking to tickle so you play war games so but what else is there to play 
[00:19:00]  well you said you were playing golf this summer and you were calm and because and then something  happened and now i'm playing people say you feel the way you feel by by the by the games you play  now and by the porn you watch you know you mean feel there's certain porn you watch when you're feeling  whatever and then certain point when you're feeling you know you're feeling gentle and you're feeling  loving and then certain certain point you watch when you feel your self-esteem is lower when it's  higher like i watch a lot of fat girl porn when i'm not feeling good a lot of bbw porn when i'm not 
[00:19:30]  feeling and nude africa nude africa i do a lot of that and you know like i said i mean i know you don't  like big girls but you know i think it's easier to catch a pig than a parakeet to be honest with you  i will catch you can we say pig yeah i just want to make sure i'm still feeling out what i can say  even in the context is that right anyway look man all right so bear with me today uh you know i'm

[00:22:30]  an email and said patrice hey man i'm you know you're off my top eight uh real emotion i felt the  emotion in the in the in this message yeah like you could feel he was upset like disappointed and  he was like you know i didn't know you was uh you felt like this and i'm really upset with you  and he goes man you know i'm taking you out my top eight and you know what man put yourself  in in the position of the average white guy the plight the plight of the white man is basically what 
[00:23:00]  he was in implying and i you know i try to be fair by the way uh phone number is one eight seven seven  two one two six two six three one eight seven two one two six two six three two and two o and a o a  and d a but if you got a cell phone it's six two six three because there's no letters on a cell phone  so look i try to sit around and think about the plight of the white man and i'm serious about this 
[00:23:30]  one of the plights i think might be something that a white guy never had to do in this world is  actually have a uh an excuse not an excuse but uh when when dealing with a black person  now that he's something he's never had to do ever in history is actually  like have a reason for what he does like in about the 1940s you could just kick a dude in his kneecap 
[00:24:00]  a black dude a black dude in his kneecap and just go and the dude's like ah man shut up  why'd you do that he don't even need to say i felt like it he just you know he could just wink  and just go yeah yeah i feel you um i'm trying to think let me let me think of another thing maybe  and here's the thing i'm really trying to understand this dude i'm really trying to  understand like what the plight of the white man could be now i discredit 
[00:24:30]  anything that everybody else has to deal with meaning taxes no you somebody's gonna take your  house no because somebody's gonna take my house uh your mama got bunions no my mama got bunions uh  you need you know money to get your teeth the the human plight of living in this country every day  does not count because that's everybody anything exclusive to the white man anything that's exclusive  to your plight right what is it that you go through every day like look most black people don't want to 
[00:25:00]  be anything but black but to be black you have to actually stand up and go i'm proud to be black you  have to be defiant to live proud to be proud you have to go i'm feeling good baby right i'm gonna  get arrested for no reason but i'm feeling good i may not get this job but i'm still feeling good  i'm gonna my girl's gonna talk to me because i didn't come on with the proper money she yapping 
[00:25:30]  too much but i can't clock her right upside her head right for yapping too much but i'm feeling good  proud to be this way i'm not going to use no excuses whatever that means i don't even know  black people that use excuses for being black but i'm trying to figure out what is it every day  the pressure of being a white dude maybe having black people accuse you of being racist but that's  almost they don't that that might be a concern now that doesn't even count right for real for real 
[00:26:00]  so please do me a big favor let me know what the plight of the white of the white man is the  plight what's different different different from any other thank you from any other group you can  think of please tell me because i'm i'm really truly trying to understand this please tell me why i  should feel like you're victimized sam and by the way sam you better choose a side because when the race 
[00:26:30]  war happens jack i'm i'm gonna be the first one to put a bullet right through that giant afro well  then i'll pick your side good good yeah because you know you you know i'm gonna tell you when it  comes down to it if it is that wall yeah you are black i know all right they used to in apartheid they  used to stick a pencil in your hair and if it didn't if it could stand up yeah if it wouldn't come  out of your hair then you're black jesus by that definition i'm very black i'm black too i guess yeah yeah 
[00:27:00]  all right really it's a lot of nappy-headed white guys but your hair your hair is more like ronald  mcdonald's hair your your hair is more like gallagher or gallagher too or someone that woke up out of a  coma shocker con yeah you're a white guy daddy yeah you're yeah you're definitely white guy sam  make a choice for the pencil make a choice that's a sharpie it's not even a pencil 
[00:27:30]  hold on here goes somebody with the plight hold on here's somebody here eric hello eric please tell  me i'm serious man the plight of the white man i'm i'm dead up man dude you will never know what it's  like to be white you know how much sunblock i have to put on on a daily basis sunblock you know  enough melanoma melanoma skin cancer but boys i should have been specific social pressure  but that is that is the one thing god did curse you with is tumor no pig skin tumors yeah yeah 
[00:28:00]  definitely the plan of the white guy you know what that's very fair all right all right you know what  that's very fair i will that is something where but that's still i don't know if that's enough  enough to make you like think about being not white is the fact that you may get melanoma no  because sickle cell anemia doesn't make me want to not be black you know what i mean not that and 
[00:28:30]  black people could get melanoma and it's not light very very light it's not it's not often but let me  see uh rich rich yo patrice what's up man hey look i'm glad you're hosting i appreciate you  it's a comic but the real plight of the white man are racist white hating n-words like you  it's the fact wow the reason it's the reason that we have to deal with it's this nonsense we have to 
[00:29:00]  deal with every day all right rich now don't get it don't get it wait a minute don't get into battle  mode let's let's talk about this all right all right all right now don't get into battle mode let me  ask you this let me ask you this let me ask you this go ahead and if you was black would you think  that the the the complaining white race hating black people had a point just to kind of and it's not 
[00:29:30]  you like see this is what i want to inform my white friends it's not it's not you rich it's not uh  uh uh your skin it's not i don't look at you like rich is not the oppressor yeah you're not the  oppressor dude i'm not saying you're the oppressor i'm saying i understand that and i and i don't hate  you as a black man so just to be clear i don't hate you so it's a color thing is what you're saying  right well what i'm saying is is that the guilt that is constantly applied because of racism you're 
[00:30:00]  racist and and look i won't i will not deny that to a certain extent i have racism i have prejudice  i prejudge now is that cause of black people is that cause of of is that cause of black people  you think is that is that everybody no no no no no no no i don't blame black people for being  prejudice i think that's life experience if i saw some uh uh raggedy looking homeless guy i would be  concerned just as i would be for when i see a black person it's it's prejudice it's prejudging 
[00:30:30]  based on life experience that's not a black man's uh i don't blame black people for that  what i do say is that black people uh uh when when you put yourself in the group uh that that wait a  minute hold on though you know that this country puts us in these groups though you realize that  you realize you realize our president you realize our president right the the president elect not  quite the president yet you realize that this country is so racist and racial that sure that we 
[00:31:00]  will just black people will embrace anybody black as black and white people will look at anybody  that's not white as black but absolutely true he's first he's first generation african and white  but the fact that this country is what it is puts him in a position to have to be black i don't see i 
[00:31:30]  don't want to my father's from barbados so my mother says and but i have to take black just like right  now dude what do you do for a living you don't sound like you know you don't sound  a truck driver hey you're a hard-working white boy right but absolutely i've owned businesses and  i decided to get into trucking because it's less stressful all right now ultimately you think white  but you're not really white like like i can't here's a crazy thing i don't really know i don't 
[00:32:00]  really know how what's the statistics on how many people actually own plantations in the country it had to  be five plantations i'm a full-blooded italian okay how can you feel white all of my grandparents  are from italy and that is exactly the point you would not look at me as an italian immigrant or  first generation second generation he's saying that he is his plight is that he's grouped together 
[00:32:30]  with races just because of the color of his skin that's what i'm saying but isn't that isn't that  a country isn't that a country problem and not it's an individual problem no it's you it's you and the  and people that think like you and look i'm not trying to when i say you i'm not being uh derogatory  i'm saying that as a group go ahead man i'm just saying i'm just saying it's a group we all and 
[00:33:00]  we're all placed in these groups uh uh you look at me as a white guy but you embrace that though  i'm basically grouped in with those i don't you know what his all right thanks rich his was his  was interesting okay uh like you you have a lot of people white people that came as immigrants right  and they come to this country and they say well i my my um ancestors didn't own slaves but the  reason why they they became immigrants came to this country in the first place was because this country 
[00:33:30]  had opportunities but the opportunities were with the the reason why this country has the money that  it has is because of 300 years of slavery free labor that able that enabled america to become a  rich nation that it is and so they they embark upon the here's what here's what i know of  white people that i know they don't care sure this is what is the tough thing about this country 
[00:34:00]  is none of us really and and this goes back to the the thing i was talking about about the games  how does this there is no history in this country for us to really know what's going on like this guy  is an italian now he claims that we look at him a certain way but you he by his attitude the benefits  of not that he reaps the benefits he takes the side of the color that this country makes him on so 
[00:34:30]  should he actively work against racism because he should say i'm italian he is my thing as an italian  he can't he's look you can't retake the you can't take the side of the color expect not to get the two  colors that are eternal enemies in this country right i have to take black but i can be specific right but 
[00:35:00]  if the cops do something to me you know i can't go to the half beijing coalition of america i have to  go to somebody black that got a little power because it's the skin color thing and and quite frankly we're  the only two sides that pick a color now whose responsibility is it for us to stop that you  understand 877-212-6263 i'm trying to find out the plight of the white man and i'm dead serious the  plight of the white man and try to make me care don't try to make me don't don't get mad 
[00:35:30]  at me have real dialogue real serious man i'm trying to understand what your problem is  being white please jason in virginia jason yes sir hey i gotta tell you you're one of my favorite  all-time comics you're incredible and i appreciate your honesty in my opinion i think the white man's  plot kind of goes along with the fact that i think most of us feel like we're just losing losing 
[00:36:00]  something you know like like the Boston Celtics they were you know champions for all those years  and we see like it almost feels like maybe we're losing something to other minorities and then you  know get things like affirmative action and stuff like that it just feels like everything's against  but maybe i don't know you know what you know what jason here it makes a lot of sense and i'm  gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you what i feel about that here's what white people are are losing you're 
[00:36:30]  losing this is why my thing is utopian me me and dante talk about this a lot uh thanks for calling dude  you you like it what it is is what it is right like what you get you don't care the black president is  the black president and it has if that don't happen then you can't do the next thing right my thing is  i want a heart change heart change from everybody but i'm not going to be the first one to do it i 
[00:37:00]  ain't taking the heart change high road jack because there's been a lot of people the beat down  exactly there's been a lot of people in this world that said turn the other cheek but ultimately that's  been our thing but black people have forgiven for years we've forgiven the fact that i'm not hijacking  something flying planes into things and buses blowing the fact that i'm not an insurgent  you got to be happy about that my complaining my complaining it should be nothing but i think 
[00:37:30]  white people and again i have to i have to generalize because i can't go stan and jim and bob  white people have never had to deal with not being overtly racist right now it's not  the right thing to be racist this is why obama being president to me is wonderful in terms of seeing it  but in terms of i think in 1940 that it would have been the same amount of people that would have voted for 
[00:38:00]  a black president if it was able to be and i'm gonna tell you why i think it's been the same amount of  good people who are against oppression always forever the amount of people who are who are  against injustice have been the same amount forever but but wait a minute but  back then being racist in 1920 was 1860 that was was the right thing it was involved so if you was 
[00:38:30]  against racism in 1860 that was a big deal that was something where you go you know what i know see  white people who have who suffered this at the same time black people did are misrepresented in  this country because right now it's the wrong thing to be racist so being right there's no  consequence to being right it's just we that's the thing we talked about this is like it's easy to be 
[00:39:00]  gay now it's easy to be out it wasn't be easy to be gay when they was bashing dudes at the stonewall  gay guy in 1925 was a soldier a soldier out gay guy in 2008 you kind of go  i don't yeah really you're going through something you want to be married in 1925 
[00:39:30]  they was gonna smash you in your face yeah we in new york city everybody's skipping around  you go to the village dude it's skipping nobody's walking no one's walking in the village  and if you don't skip you got to go you saw in san francisco they was  gay people were chasing people out of neighborhoods yeah can you can you imagine that straight back so  ultimately what i'm saying is dude my thing why i have this suspicious thing and i can't let it go 
[00:40:00]  whatever it is is that i'm not sure how good you are because you're not allowed to be racist no  more not according to me according to society so you're saying you respect uh 1960 abolitionists  because it was hard to not 1960 yeah fair enough i get what you're saying it was hard to be not  racist it was anybody who it's easy to not be racist right it's easy to do the right thing because 
[00:40:30]  the right thing is right and and it was used to be wrong that's all i'm saying to you so you  understand where i'm coming from please can i take one more uh stop right yeah all right hold on  mike long island mike mike man what up hey what's going on trees big fan i loved you at the virus tour  thank you uh big show man um listen for years i grew up in deer park on long island right next 
[00:41:00]  door to wine dance and i had a ton of black friends a ton of puerto rican friends i'm a white guy all  right and um for a long time you got a little swagger too to you like a little black swagger  kind of yeah you know they called me white boy in a derogatory sense anytime i was in a neighborhood  or in a in a setting like at the at the basketball court or or whatever or a handball when when i  shouldn't be they they felt i shouldn't be there so how would you feel if i walked up to you and i 
[00:41:30]  was like hey black boy and boy being a derogatory statement uh term for for slavery you know what i  mean you would take that as a fence automatically you know what i'm saying yeah that's true because  again what it that's the reason i can say cracker today and i can't say something else that's why  that there's no such thing as the c word but there's such thing as the n word and other n word  and the b word and the g word and this that is because we're looking at uh white people in this country  as the better you know what i mean the oppressor the oppressor as the better that's but but but 
[00:42:00]  i understand what you're saying so let me ask you this what would you like what would you like to  see i think a lot of white people would love to love us and i really like to be called mike and i  call you patrice and that's fair enough so wait a minute wait a minute there's nothing in life there  is nothing in life worse than somebody who takes your respect from you just by using words man 
[00:42:30]  especially when you're a man and you do the right thing in this world today wait a minute  you're saying that you were hurt by white boy like almost subjugated by dudes calling you white  boy which by the way anybody any white boy around my way growing up that we call white boy was our  friend yeah wasn't derogatory let me put it in the context you know look at this white boy what the  the fuck you doing here oh wait a minute yeah go ahead go ahead though yeah you had to how many 
[00:43:00]  dunks was that go ahead man go ahead yeah you can't play ball or whatever meanwhile i got a three-point  shot you know what i mean i'm just as fair you better have a three-point shot  you don't want to be in that paint well you got to get out of here white boy  hey look man uh keep you keep the calls coming eight seven seven two one two six two six three if you  got a cell phone eight seven seven two one two oh and a if you ain't got a job uh we're gonna take  a break man this is on a excuse me opie here anthony there patrice o'neil doing our show and uh 
[00:43:30]  you know it's gonna be a good show uh but you're not gonna get paid patrice sorry  i don't know not a not a nice thing yet not a nice thing  i thought anthony was the racist like  opie's been a real bum on these things and what do they do they take these at some point today and 
[00:44:00]  yesterday and just this is how he really feels yeah  yeah sorry i get up at 5 15. do you understand what a chore that is to get up at 5 15. i think we  know yeah but white people do that anyway y'all work hard and pretty sure yeah getting up at 3 30 in  the morning for the last three years i'm pretty sure so when there's a white guy who's a loser what is 
[00:44:30]  his excuse i see a lot of really mediocre white guys in this room what is your excuse and i think  that might tie into the anger of it like can i have an excuse to stink  you said that racism is not over until a mediocre black guy can rise to greatness that's what i want  for everybody mediocrity every black president can't be god jesus like he can't be african white 
[00:45:00]  spanish with an islamic name black man magna cum laude in harvard 4.9 grade point you can't i want a  average c student black guy to be able to run for president is it possible i want this is what i want  meaty meat black mediocrity to rise to great rise to be able to do great things you can't think of one 
[00:45:30]  black mediocre dude and listen i i already hear you saying i already hear it watch your mouth but let's be  honest don't try to mess with my self-esteem jack but let's be honest like a dude where you go  black dude that's doing black mayors there are i just want enough black people around so that i don't  have to go i don't have to defend anything black just because it's black that's fair is that fair 
[00:46:00]  i'm just saying black mayor it's been enough bad black mayors for me to go  sharp james who's the pimp marion barry marion barry's a junkie he's the original bad black man  some people questioningly question we say dinkins which is i mean that's questionable and that's  that's your opinion but i'm talking about just straight up did some wrong whack stuff uh kwame 
[00:46:30]  fitzpatrick of course was um questionable pimp um cheating stealing money from the government wait  wait wait wait cory booker is so magnanimous he's getting a reality show really this is the guy in  the new newark mayor newark mayor cory booker following him around and doing a reality show on  him he was he was slated to be if obama didn't get in cory booker was slated to be the next  presidential black yeah and him and the other kid uh henry ford howard ford yeah ford ford 
[00:47:00]  that's i don't know if it's henry or howard ford light-skinned republican dude  light-skinned republican dude gray eyes he looks like an obama stunk you're looking some beautiful  beautiful yeah he could like that's another thing i want an ugly black president  i don't want our president to have to be gorgeous somebody look like nipsey russell obama's gorgeous  nipsey russell face i want nipsey russell to be i want a crispy uh black dude with something in 
[00:47:30]  the corner of his mouth that he has to keep wiping if you vote him president then i i might think racism  stop sam cassell president they'll never vote i'm not voting sam cassell i'll be the first  in the look i'm gonna look at sam cassell funny eye uh speech anyway uh welcome back to the show uh  uh 877-212-6263 if you got a job 877-212-o-a-n-d-a-o-n-d-a if you're at home still chilling 
[00:48:00]  uh white plight white plight we're talking about it is there actually the plight of the white man because  i got it again i got an email that on my myspace that said i'm gonna be i'm taking you off my top  paper trees because you're a racist and blah blah blah he was like me now he doesn't and he's like  look put yourself in the position of a white man and i've tried to think really because that's a fair 
[00:48:30]  question right and i'm like what what is what do you have to go through and again i don't want to hear  that my my daughter's dumb that my kids uh uh barely can read my mother has a goiter  my they're taking taxes i don't want to hear stuff plight exclusive exclusive for the white  plight to pecker woods i mean to to can i say that yeah stump brain yeah sure i can say any abusive 
[00:49:00]  white almost wow what's the what's the white thing i can't say white emma effa yeah you can't  but i'm saying is it it's the emma effort that you can't any white slur that i cannot say  i guess redneck we're gonna fight you can say redneck really wow yeah jeff foxworthy made that  okay are you serious yeah wow can you say moon cricket that's what they call us i have never 
[00:49:30]  heard moon cricket oh yeah i learned that in boston i said look it n word is getting old what's the new  one somebody said moon cricket i said damn that's one you say at a party that's one that even if you're  around a lot of white people you gotta look around six times like uh oh my god and i don't even i don't  even porch monkey can you say porch monkey oh that's drawing that's close porch monkey is even 
[00:50:00]  understandable where it could come from which is right you know all the porches i see some old  slave pictures and you're just sitting around looking at you they call you monkey and they're  sitting there i can understand that and a lot of things like that um but there is absolutely  really honestly there's no racial slur that is barred from black people saying about white people  and i think that's unfair because that almost gives you a sense of superiority that's the set  that's the plight of white that's one of the things you can put on your list as the plight i can call 
[00:50:30]  them something that doesn't matter yes when i say that the end this is what i mean about the country  having issues and making issues that have nothing to do with us because the average dude really the  average black dude that thinks is not bothered by the n-word and if we had a decision we go i don't  care man you say what you feel like saying because i'm gonna say everything i want to say because i'm  awful you better be lucky i ain't white i am a racist god i'm awful oh i look if you can see me right 
[00:51:00]  now you just i know faces that can look at people and go ugh i go ugh the best you've ever seen in  your life oof anyway we're talking about the plight of the white man uh pete from the bronx pete  hey morning guys how are you sir hey listen try being uh try being a jew i mean i got people still  blaming me for killing god hey look you know this is my this is very interesting about uh black people  and the jews man i i'm really obsessed with comparing your plight to our plight i really am 
[00:51:30]  and all my buddies from yeah go ahead and let me ask you this let me ask you this sir um you stop me  when i'm wrong i you you jews moved on pretty well that's what i'm looking at because jews you've moved  on pretty well and also and and all not not the stupid poor jews like me but some jews no you've  moved on from your two plights that you i think you have one more plight above us because i i count 
[00:52:00]  slavery as a continuing epic that never stops you know at least in your work camps they let you work  in ours they killed us but okay don't get me wrong now now if i say something wrong it ain't because  i'm trying to be anti-semite but but from 1619 to 1865 a lot of stuff was going on okay i would  say in that particular time let's say just the holocaust that at least it was quick and like in 
[00:52:30]  the in the span of five years it was quick and the thing about the holocaust one it's still a crime  to be a nazi right still a crime it was vilified you know the geneva convention and all that you had  an actual villain that's like if this was a james bond movie and you said i'm gonna write a james bond  movie based on holocaust everything is in place you have the bad guy you have his henchman you have the 
[00:53:00]  the the hero you have the villains everything is so what i mean that you moved on as a jew you are able  to move on because you don't have to look at every german like he's a nazi it's very specific  you know i mean the problem with slavery with black people is that if your kids are born your kids are  slaves that that that was really the worst part of slavery you should say okay you're a slave  but your kids they're free well let's go back let's go back to your brenner days then 
[00:53:30]  when the jews were building the pyramids the kids were born they were free they were actually walking  around the town it was only one generation slavery during during the exodus it was a whole different  thing and also they took care of them like slaves were actually you know part of society so it wasn't  like you know when the jews were building the pyramids it was different you know what white people  kind of learned from that they learned how to really do do slavery big time are you saying that 
[00:54:00]  that they that that this country said here's the mistakes that your brenner made  and we're gonna fix it this time i think these scumbags really perfected it you know this listen  we're gonna get these guys over here and we're gonna build an industry we're gonna we're gonna get  all the cotton break that's what that's why the whole north said whoa whoa whoa whoa they didn't want  to stop slavery because they had a moral problem they weren't making any money off of it right  this is delicious yeah and i'm glad of jews saying it because now they can just doubly hate you 
[00:54:30]  it makes true i don't know how but here's your here's your situation jews stereotype is that they  run the world that's your stereotype is that you you you have connived and found a way to rule  planet earth under under some evil scheme and so ultimately as a people you were able to move on 
[00:55:00]  like i that's what i think is i'm trying to figure out a way to move on and please if you say to me  anybody just love it starts with you man it starts with your heart will you shut up please with that  it starts with i'm a cup is half empty guy so please i i want to go look man and and look it  doesn't wear me out it just is the fact you do it easily that like i say the oj verdict when the fact 
[00:55:30]  that you see everybody cheering and everybody sad will tell you that that's not some taut thing it's  not about i didn't text every black person to say cheer when he got away and i didn't text everybody  see the the the this is interesting because i i my thing is i always looked at the jews uh uh  during the moses time they could be finished because they were free by god right you know you  you know your brenda wanted to kill him hey hold up thanks for calling pete you your brenda wanted to 
[00:56:00]  call him like like to to kill him and he went out to kill you saw the movie yeah i know all my bible  chariots from mdm white moses come in and and he was the whole story right uh uh the pharaoh  made sure all the firstborn because it was a prophecy passover firstborn of this and that and  then lamb's blood on the wall you know but and it's still you still got uh all these holidays based 
[00:56:30]  on that you have a system of living based on that meaning the ten commandments are all really  kind of that's our system of living that's everybody's system of living is the ten commandments  really you kind of base if you're basically good that's how you're trying to follow some of the at  least the you know thou shalt not kill it'd be nice you know a lot of dudes and thou you know  travis thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife that's not working out for me i'm playing with you 
[00:57:00]  so uh but they the jews were able to move on because there was a national like what we talk  about the de-dixification of of germany like they removed the swastikas the eagles everything it  became nationally it became not okay to be a nazi right and that's that's why they're able to i don't  know a a stunt brain is is slavery are you what are you doing playing sudoku no keeping track i'm  posting this on onaradio.com okay is is that was slavery ever uh said to be a criminal act or or a 
[00:57:30]  crime against humanity slavery in america find that out for me i'm sure it is todd todd in new york  how you doing man how you doing i'm going all right i'm trying to figure out the plight of the  white man i'm i'm dead serious man because i want to i want to end this i want to end it  yeah you and me both man i think there's a lot of people that do but what do you want to end 
[00:58:00]  i want to end all of that why what's the point of racism man i'm a 22 year old white male  all right and what's what's the i don't i mean the average white guy has to work just like anybody else  we know that i know see i know that i know that that's see that's the thing you got to understand  black people are not on that that's not our platform and our platform is not that you don't  work hard and that you ain't trying to take care of your family and things like that our platform 
[00:58:30]  is something that the country did to our psyche that doesn't enable us to really truly  love your skin color that's that's what it is that's all it is it's like we're trying to figure  that out you know what i'm saying i understand you're a hard-working dude but it doesn't matter  really because you feel upset and you're just an average working 22 year old white guy but you're  applying my feelings to you which tells you something you should just go ah nah ain't me and i feel what 
[00:59:00]  you feeling black man but it ain't me but you and it it it gets to you you're a young 22 year old and  it gets to you something's going on out there because it doesn't affect me you know what i'm  saying like i look at uh i look at a black man and i'm just like it's another black man there's  nothing wrong with this guy he's possibly doing the same things i'm doing right you know i'm saying 
[00:59:30]  i believe everybody in the country really they don't care about it right you know i mean there  are people that do you know the clan you've got you know white supremacy so what do i do what do i do  about them i i just kind of do the whole turn the other cheek kind of look the other way kind of  love them kind of thing because that's what we always kind of did is we we we took a nice brick  to the side of the head while we're trying to be peaceful and it's always kind of been that way 
[01:00:00]  but i'm feeling you thanks for the call man thank you um i i have the answer to your question what's  that technically slavery was illegal when the 13th amendment was adopted in 1865 so it has been  illegal in america it's illegal to do yes but also it's the holocaust is illegal but it's also  the the act of the holocaust itself was a criminal act i think if the country i'm trying to think of  some ways we can get over it i think if the country actually said that slavery was a criminal act 
[01:00:30]  um i know it's going to mean nothing but i think as a if it's some type of trial the country  committed a crime it's only going to be five people how do you actually are going to you can't  convict the cut you convict a uh uh an idea well there was a for like i said the other day there  was a formal presentation in the congress this past summer where america apologized saying yes what  we did was wrong arrogant that is well any white guy can get up and apologize for slavery congress 
[01:01:00]  is not a totally white institution i don't know if you check congress congress is just stop stump  brain congress is white just stop just stop just senator obama came out of some some blackness  somewhere don't mean it's not we're talking institutional situations here right i'm saying  that the holocaust in itself was a crime right yeah so they didn't scoop up everybody but anybody 
[01:01:30]  that they thought was affiliated with it to this day is a criminal now i'm not saying it's going to be  hard to do that but i'm saying at least where historically black people can go okay these people  let's say you put on trial anybody that owned land at that time plantation or say  listen it becomes the 40 acres and a mule thing once once you do that it becomes financial and then 
[01:02:00]  through our legal system now then people can start to make a movement towards reparations  what what because see reparations will never really make us happy because you know let's be honest  dudes get their reformation money let's be honest you lap dances and some new now uh pomade  45 let's be honest that ain't gonna change we're gonna be in deep trouble if we get reparation  money if we get rep we ain't ready for reparation money because if we get reparation money and still 
[01:02:30]  talk slavery and still talk racism and still talk racial they'll just say all right slavery's back  what's the point because we gonna we gonna we gonna put you up there again and so we can give you  another reparation in five years because there's nothing else we can do you know what i'm saying  hold on now we're gonna go to pat pat and howard beach how are you sir what's up patrice how you  doing i'm good sir so uh i'm i'm howard beach probably the most racist part of new york if you 
[01:03:00]  didn't know that already um i would have to definitely say that our plight is having to deal  with al sharpton we can we can watch the news and specifically or everybody specifically al sharpton  or people like al sharpton people like al sharpton but specifically al sharpton himself i think  not only has he made more people racist but he's he's he's just set people back i can't i you know 
[01:03:30]  everybody the white people conversations with no black people around is all about al sharpton  i don't think i think thank you for your call man thanks i i think um high thinking people are  also a big problem in terms of this racial thing meaning the bill o'reileys of the world who you  can't prove are racist that's another thing can't prove it no more right it's like something you kind  of got to feel but like al sharpton uh bill o'reilly uh sean hannity sean you know uh uh i know the 
[01:04:00]  dude is i'm gonna call him sean you know uh sh it's it's that most people are dumb i mean most  people are only smart enough to listen but not communicate so when you got somebody that you  feel is communicating on your behalf you just let them communicate it's a multiple choice you know  what i'm saying so ultimately al sharpton is really one of the best communicators out there because see 
[01:04:30]  farrakhan is to me the best communicator but he's what he is he's just what he is he's like  i don't even know how to explain it but see al is in the game farrakhan's not in the game farrakhan is  is i think he's trying to really enlighten everybody on some other stuff and but al is in that game and i  think the fact that al is in that game he uses the fact that there's a lot of black people who just love  any black man who could communicate the black plight like and i don't look i my thing is i just want to 
[01:05:00]  see things like like let's you know the michael vick thing i don't want to defend criminals i'm a dog  lover but when white people accuse any black i'll tell you how white black people react when when white  people go after a black dude and it seems like they're going after a black dude black people are it's  a knee-jerk reaction it's just black people are compelled to defend to defend a dog drowner  you know what i mean but white people are never compelled to defend gary ridgeway for chopping up 
[01:05:30]  20 000 hookers you know what i'm saying for order order order uh what's the dude uh the btk guy for  tying up families and killing white because they don't feel a connection to him and they don't feel as  though they have but why do they feel a connection to black people generalizing their skin color  because they don't feel a connection to i mean quite frankly look at stump brain we should be horrified 
[01:06:00]  of him stump brain look like he got people tied up in his house he definitely looks like a middle east  he fits the profile of somebody that murdered some people a couple of hookers dead around him  but i'm not afraid of the dude yeah why is that not the case but i'm not saying this  to say it should be the case i'm saying that this is what it is man you know all right look uh 877-212-6263  we're gonna be back with oh and a uh this is patrice o'neil and dante nero we'll be back in a minute 
[01:06:30]  hey uh you're listening to patrice o'neil as he fills in for the vacationing opian anthony show  not really vacationing but we're just not here uh try to call up and get a word in edgewise  good luck to you good luck 
[01:07:00]  i've been letting people talk i've been very good man this is about your history though this is really  i've been i am a i'm a victim of my own my own past i'm trying man oh my goodness  angelo we blacks emulate italians  your screener there your screener takes a portion he takes a portion of what you tell him and probably 
[01:07:30]  puts that on your board but that's all right he's doing his job what it is is earlier angelo yeah  yeah you say blacks try to emulate italians and look don't it might be true partially at least  partially true we we we do respect here's what we do respect about uh which i always think black  people need a criminal organization we really do need a respect well run and well run well scared  and and and people all the way to the top because it is questionable that the mafia 
[01:08:00]  the mafia killed jfk had something to do with it that is high level gangster you think that's high  level gangster yeah so ultimately look being like a uh it's not a bad thing to feel like you want to  be like a mafia because the mafia is a criminal organization that actually like scared everybody  but no one was scared of them see black fear is more like oh god honey grab your purse and he's gonna 
[01:08:30]  he's gonna kidnap me tie me up and then do something to you it's kind of like yeah but petty mafia  was specific you only killed each other it was it was a beautiful thing so i i mean if that's where  you're going i'm well where i'm going is what urged me to call was your partner for the day i i apologize  for not knowing the name oh dante sorry earlier uh the italian american caller you did throw in a  little comment about how they were able to even though they were immigrants didn't have slaves so they  don't trace the same history as other whites you said that they did take advantage of the color of 
[01:09:00]  the skin where i was calling to say okay when we were when we were coming off the boat and we were  coming in and we were on lines treated like cattle and having the names chopped up and being told  you're just going to have living tight living quarters which are the equivalent of today's  projects i would believe that they decided let's form our own little organization to get respect in  this country yes you know the organization that you're referring to yes sir our own little  organization wait a minute you can't actually say it i thought it was over i used you still can't 
[01:09:30]  really say it they just found bodies in in uh are you serious in long island are they making a  comeback well let me let me say this assume thing we call the mafia i heard about it i don't know if  it exists i'm not sure let me just let me just go back i'm sorry about that go ahead angelo no no  i'm saying and where that led to the emulating italian stains was me saying to the screener how  even today's hip-hop artists you hear the names of junior mafia you hear the names of capone of this 
[01:10:00]  erb erb goddy you could even you could even trace bling bling back to the guidos of the 80s with  baggy jeans and and of course hanging out of their turtleneck it just they tweaked it a little bit  maybe maybe bada bing i mean i won't take that credit away from you if you want it but what i  think is that the that the mob there's just that idea that you could control your own destiny through  crime if you needed to i don't know i i really think we do respect that whole that's why black 
[01:10:30]  people love thanks for the call angel that's why black people i gotta go i'm being pulled over by a  black cop oh you son of a uh you know that's what i'm saying about scarface dude black people love  scarface but that's why i'm telling you stump brain scarface is just it's a story of a guy that just  shot his way to shot his way to the shot his way to the top came across on a boat came came came from  cuba uh uh went to a here's a story in a nutshell came from cuba went to a detention camp right

[01:18:30]  questionable homosexuals segue what's going on uh with this e-harmony situation dude uh the e-harmony  online lighting online dating by the way sorry let me reintroduce you okay this is uh my friend  dante nero my co-host for this evening as i'm as i'm uh filling in for the boys okay on it go ahead  on online dating service e-harmony has agreed to create a new website com uh compatible partners  for gay and lesbian users created as a part of settlement why'd you say that like um what 
[01:19:00]  why'd you just say that like uh did you sound like sulu read that again what users uh compatible  partners for gay and lesbian users users go ahead finish sweetie created as a part of a settlement  with eric mckinley a gay man from new jersey the website will provide services for users seeking  same-sex partners by march 31st really really why but why is that you you were up in arms about this uh 
[01:19:30]  uh stunt i don't look my i don't listen if there's a problem if there is my thing is i'm very my problems  with this i have a distinct opinion about something but it's never based on what somebody should or  shouldn't be doing it's just my opinion uh my opinion about gay people and and what they're 
[01:20:00]  fighting for the platform that they're using like i don't care about this e-harmony thing if you want  to hook up gay people i don't care what difference does it really make to me at all my thing is being  gay is a sexual activity not even activity it's a sexual feeling because being gay has to do with  being attracted to the same sex am i lying you're right who's gay in here okay gay guy quiet gay guy 
[01:20:30]  over in the corner is am i lying that being gay is is strictly a sexual thing right i mean that's what  you're that's what that's the word is it applies to you as a man or you as a woman being attracted to  the same sex that's that's what it is in a nutshell that's what gay is yes right correct engaging in a 
[01:21:00]  relationship with the same sex not just sexual activity not i'm not talking about movement hip  movement no no i'm just saying that sexual activity does not deem you just gay alone you have to be in  a relationship or want to pursue a relationship with the same whoa whoa so wait just actual hip  movement into a place having gay sex doesn't make you gay you're right doesn't make you having a gay  experience doesn't make you a homosexual or having a couple of gay experiences i don't know any straight 
[01:21:30]  guys that would agree with that just that's what people say i agree with you that if you're you  know if you're doing that business then you're a gay guy or that's the isn't that the point that's  what the that's the technical term sit down sissy you asked you asked i know i asked i was curious i  was curious so but that's all i'm oh all i wanted to make sure my point is this i i know gay people  this proposition 8 in california right i know that gay people are fighting for certain things that i'm 
[01:22:00]  not against them having my whole thing is that i don't think anything could be compared to the  plight of any group who's oppressed that can't not be that tomorrow if they don't feel his his but how  do you feel about the fact that this whole e-harmony thing is brought on by the fact of a it was there  was a legal settlement okay by this guy erica mckinley eric mckinley um he got a legal set settlement 
[01:22:30]  and that was the reason for them creating this whole aspect of e-harmony for for for uh same-sex  partners so basically they're forced to right right  i guess if i owned a company i guess it was my company right and i didn't want to that wasn't the  place because here's ultimately what it could do it could interfere i suppose with the clientele 
[01:23:00]  of the original company i was right so so if i'm trying to hook up men and women who and all kinds  of men and women because some some women and some men are very traditional about that so ultimately if  i'm on a site that may get confused with uh a site that's hooking up homosexuals and lesbians i'm  gonna move on to uh site number two match or something like that right i'm gonna move on to something else  so ultimately i i don't if i had a company i don't want you to force me to hook up gay dudes 
[01:23:30]  because quite frankly gay dudes there's enough places to hook up like dumpsters could you not  fight for everything trust me fighting for everything is not going to get you what you need to have you  need to pick a platform and the platform will be this the health uh uh insurance thing the being able 
[01:24:00]  to decide your loved one's situation in the hospital to decide money issues if you have joint accounts  to decide will property things like that but stop forcing gay on everybody because nobody's forcing  heterosexuality on anybody stop forcing me to think being gay is fantastic can i not be into that you you  gotta well you're right i don't think they should be forcing it but i i think what i was looking at 
[01:24:30]  some of the stuff in the news yesterday and that's a lot of the protests and stuff that they're doing  because of prop eight they uh they are becoming violent like they're they're going after people  i've never seen gay people as scary as the ones in whatever area that was what is it sugar loaf farms  what's the area in san francisco the tenderloin but no it's a absolutely it's like a street it's not the 
[01:25:00]  tenderloin the tenderloin is like prostitution stuff it's a like an area like you would call the village  it's it's the village of out there but boy i do not want to have those gay dudes angry with me  yeah you understand hold up wait a minute what am i saying more more on prop eight in the plate of the  gays but first some primetime gossip from sam  we're back and primetime gossip is exploding with breaking opie and anthony news 
[01:25:30]  ona show hosts opie and anthony have abandoned ship they've decided to take an early vacation and  leave everyone's favorite token black friend patrice o'neill with the reins of the show i almost  think it's a setup i i don't trust it however what started off as a happy-go-lucky experiment  has quickly become a hostile takeover upon sitting down in the studio patrice immediately became drunk 
[01:26:00]  with power threatening the staff of the ona show i'd like to thank um sickly little anthony and um  in love opie for letting me do this and and abuse his staff i might have to actually whip these guys  into shape within 10 minutes patrice started restaffing and saying goodbye to many of the show regulars  claiming that there were too many white faces around him i'm gonna fire some brain soon  i'm gonna be a puerto rican e rocks out of here i'm already playing in my cabinet 
[01:26:30]  patrice's reign of power is seemingly unstoppable however if there is any good news to come of this  at least patrice is breaking some of those ugly black stereotypes there's gonna be strippers and  pitbull fighting at this place before you know it how has patrice managed to pirate the opie and anthony  show will ona get it back and who will survive stay tuned as ptg keeps you informed on one of the  most dangerous situations in radio history hi opie here anthony there patrice o'neill doing our show 
[01:27:00]  the very wordy patrice o'neill doing our show today i want to see how they're going to fit commercials  into all this babble  shut up  shut up  with your  with your babble you could have just said this you could have insult me one time 
[01:27:30]  at six o'clock and then had it done  that's a lot of pressure not one  hey patrice man go and get him tiger  that's that's the support that's the support black people get who cares i'm always ready for  the pressure i walk down the street that's why gay parades sick of me because i have a i'm a black  guy parade every day every day i leave the house i should be twirling something in my hand because i  have a parade whether i want to or not your mother 
[01:28:00]  you know what i mean do you understand what i'm saying you feel me stump brain  you feel me you stump brain do you feel me  i feel you  god it's hard to  it's very hard to keep it real  it's hard to keep it real when you got  um police officers as friends  dante  yeah  today he got pulled over and  officer uh toms lee and coin let me go first time i ever got let go let go by black as a by white cops ever in my black truck 
[01:28:30]  no there's no way i swear to god because you're kind of you're easy  no i got a black truck with rims and so we actually we actually have to thank uh the new york city police  yes absolutely uh actually we have to thank them and we have to thank opie and anthony  because ultimately i think you started by saying i'm doing radio with patrice o'neill yeah  and then they went to put the cuffs on you and then i said on the opie and they go oh oh okay go ahead 
[01:29:00]  god speed god god speed young  yo you're one of the negro  one of the cosby's  and they gave you a pat on your head  and a slight  a slight  a fist bump  go get a negro  not even a fist bump  on the chin  go get him buddy  buddy yo  kinda  tap  god it's hard to keep it real  when you got a mortgage  it is hard to keep it real  when your credit score is in the sevens 
[01:29:30]  it's it's really hard to keep it real  when you're upset because the water pressure on your refrigerator  uh water spout  has lessened  so you have to call a white repair man  your crushed ice maker won't work  it's not  it's my crushed ice maker  it's not due  because  i have a party  i have a party  for thanksgiving  that opie's not invited to once again 
[01:30:00]  gotta announce his  uninvitedness  you're not invited  and not because i don't want you there  just because you  you're probably doing something  i think he'll probably be on his honeymoon on thanksgiving  yeah  oops  sorry i keep forgetting  i don't know what he's such a  he's such a spy  i don't know what to say about him  covert  i don't even know what color he says he is  i think opie's asian  anyway  uh  you know  it's tough to keep it real  i want to keep it real  i tell you what 
[01:30:30]  you know  back to the prop 8 thing  is that  here's one of the things that  because they're trying to blame black people for not  for not voting for it  i'm trying to tell you something about  black people real quick  and  and  and  the bible  we're horrified of jesus  for some reason  we are  horrified  of what we think the bible stands for  if you get a real  true  religious black person  they're scared 
[01:31:00]  to deal with the black jesus thing  yeah  or even like  here's how much  here's how fair i am  i don't even say jesus is black  jesus at least  had a  looks like  saddam hussein  is that dangerous to say  could be  that's not dangerous to say  at least  if you got an old  southern aunt  that's  at least  jesus at least  looks like  amajilladada  amajilladada  at least 
[01:31:30]  if not black  if not crispy black  but he  all the stuff  happened over there  where  everybody looks like  it's a lot of sun  blam  yeah  you understand  yeah  so i'm just saying  i'm so fair  that i'm not even gonna be like  oh jesus was a black man  but jesus  he didn't look like  the lead guitarist  for queen  he didn't look like  a wet head  white boy 
[01:32:00]  he did not look like  he was crawling around  during woodstock  with a lighter in the mud  i'm gonna tell you  he don't look like that dude  i'm i'm  he didn't look like that dude  no  and  and  and this is why i guess  what i'm saying gay people  is that  the reason black people  didn't vote much  on that  is because  as a people  we're pretty horrified  one thing  black people don't do  two things  never did  growing up  and i didn't do this  until i started getting  into comedy  and meeting white people  one  we don't joke 
[01:32:30]  about god  right  now one thing  hanging out with white guys  did a little bit  you open your mind up  to travel  opens your mind up  to religion a lot  and uh  i'm not an atheist  by any means  sort of  i'm too afraid  to  to be an atheist  but i believe in something  you don't want to take it  to the hell lotto  so you hedge your bets  i'm gonna tell you  i'm gonna tell you  what  what  what  what  what god is to me  god is the 
[01:33:00]  the unexplainable beginning  it's the beginning  it's like  okay what's before  the before  the before  and the before  that's god  like i can't explain  where  like the big bang theory  had a something  before the big bang theory  all of that  i  that's why i believe in god  i just believe in this  something gotta be  higher power  gotta be  so one thing we don't  we don't do  is we don't play around  with god too much  and another thing  we don't do  we don't play  gay 
[01:33:30]  yeah  black  i didn't play gay  till i met white boys  meaning  little gay things  like holding each other's hand  or rubbing somebody's face  slightly with the earlobe  like i didn't do that  no one did  and i  and i'm not  i play gay games  i'm not even gonna play around  like  and i'm not gay  but white dudes will do  little  we'll call  we'll go like this  me and danny do it  i'll call danny  and go  all right  all right sugar draws  and he'll go  all right butter cakes  or whatever  black people don't do that 
[01:34:00]  so gay is still a very  uncomfortable issue  in the black community  that's why you're not getting  that much cooperation  that's why you're not getting  a lot of cooperation  from  from black folks on it  um  and another reason  is if  is the platform  that  your  what was that  the aristocrat  that had something  that said  gay is the new black  the advocate  the advocate  gay is the new 
[01:34:30]  let me see  where is it at  it's the new black  it's on that screen  over there  gay is the  in big  white  giant white  block letters  gay is the new  black  and  and it says  the last great  civil rights struggle  racism  the last one  yeah  racism  so after we deal  yeah  after we deal  with the fact  you're gonna be able  to wear  uh  pink socks  that's it  if i was another  if i was  first of all 
[01:35:00]  if i was black people  i'd be upset  because that means  that it's over for us  right  but if i was  anybody else  i'd be upset  if i was latino  i'd be upset  because latinos  are the next  oppressed in line  yeah  black  the latinos  can't wait  for black people's  oppression to be over  so they can move  up the oppression  ladder  they're like  good  now it's us  but i'm not sure  i'm ready to vote  for president  rodrigo  and another thing  here's here's why  latinos and asians  are gonna have a tough  time moving up 
[01:35:30]  the slots  i'll tell you  exactly why  why they have  not yet  chosen a color  they're too  specific  do you understand  so whatever  anybody calls you  like if you're  puerto rican  or if you're  mexican  or you're cuban  a lot of people  don't know this  because they  we group them  all into the same  thing you have to  be quite worldly  and you have to  give a damn  to know this  whole latino  situation 
[01:36:00]  first of all  every racial group  if you didn't  notice  has a white  the white  part  the part  that's the white  people  the part that  they don't like  like asians  is japanese  they don't like  that  the average  of all other  um asians  don't like japanese  people  because they're like  the  the high  oppressor  yeah  kind of  really  yes  yeah  ask it  call it  chinese  you can look  look at any  any uh  karate flick 
[01:36:30]  with bruce lee  it's always  these chinese  dogs  and they don't  and the  the samurai  are oppressing  the chinese  people  yeah  kicking their sign  in the air  you know that  did you white  guys  you're floating  above the planet  earth  stump brain  stump brain  with that  hmm  never heard  interesting  negros  and let me  tell you  what stump brain  did  stump brain  is gonna go  and buy  12 books  on the subject  he will never  not know  less than a  black dude  about nothing  stump brain

[01:42:30]  this is what  i propose  because black  people get to  be racist  now we  get to be  the cops  but here's  the deal  i'll sign  i'll sign  this for  you  we are  not to  take  we are  not to  get revenge  once we  take all  the civil  service  jobs  we must  put out  white people  fires  as black  firemen  we  we mustn't  profile white  people  we have to  stop them  if they  commit a  crime  and we  have to  listen to  them  no plungers

[01:44:30]  of reparations  for having  to leave  a trip  to space  which we  now own  exclusively  hold on  Ken  Ken  Asian  is on  the phone  I'm sorry  Ken  yeah what's up man  how are you  I'm sorry  I made a mistake  you said you  disagree with me  as far as what  as far as  Asians  and Latinos  not having  a group  dude I gotta  tell you  I look like  a big ass  scary Puerto  Rican  that's just  tattooed out  I look like  I'll steal  your hardcaps  and rape  your pretty  little white  wife 
[01:45:00]  really  nigga I'm  the nicest  guy in the  world  but let me  tell you  you want to  talk about  getting lumped  in with  everybody else  Carlos  Mencia  said if  you are  not white  in America  you are  a nigger  and he  is not  lying  you can't  say it  anymore  oh man  I'm sorry  that's okay  go ahead  he said  if you're  not white  you're  n-word  in this  country  that's  what  my man  Ken  said  but no  what I'm  saying  Ken  I didn't  say  that  Asians  here's the 
[01:45:30]  problem  with  thanks for  the call  too  here's the  problem  that I  have  with the  other  oppressive  oppressed  groups  who are  trying to  move up  the ladder  okay  gays  are out  and I'm  gonna tell  you why  you're not  the next  up the ladder  because  you are  you can  decide  not to  be that  I don't  care if  you're born  that way  if you  you can  go  I'm not  gay  there's  no one  that can  go no  matter how  they feel  I'm not  what I 
[01:46:00]  am  Asians  can't go  I'm not  Asian  Blacks  can't go  I'm not  Black  Puerto Ricans  can't go  I'm not  Puerto Rican  maybe Puerto  Ricans  there's  some  Latinos  that can  do that  but at  some point  you're gonna  hear that  that long  but your  problem is  why you're  not moving  up the  oppression  ladder  you have  to pick  one  thing  to be  you have  to take  a color  you have  to take  a thing 
[01:46:30]  I don't  know what  you have  to do  but you  can't be  separate  because here's  what I learned  about Puerto  Ricans  all the other  Puerto Ricans  hate them  yeah  Mexicans  Cubans  Commonwealth  they can't  stand  Puerto Ricans  because they  don't have to  swim here  and they're  citizens  they're citizens  automatically  and they  make sure  the other  ones know  it  look at  your wet  fingers  you see  Mexicans  and Puerto 
[01:47:00]  Ricans  you see  the war  they have  in boxing  you see  how hard  they fight  each other  it's  it's  it's  it's a  patriotic  thing  it's  it's  it's  the fight  of the  century  when the  top Mexican  and the  top Puerto  Rican  fight  and you  know who  wins  the Mexicans  have won  that all  the time  you know  why  Puerto Ricans  are getting  soft  because they  are  here  and they  don't have  to fight  to be here  just like 
[01:47:30]  black people  getting soft  we used to  be the  baddest  all we  were bad  in the ring  at some  point I  heard Jews  could fight  yeah  when they  were  any  any good  fighter  comes up  out of  a great  ghetto  I don't  know  I couldn't  believe that  but there  were some  Jews who  could beef  at some  point  black  people used  to be  able to  we ran  boxing  yeah  now we  shooting  but we  used to  be great  with the  fists  at some  point  it's  poverty  poverty  makes great 
[01:48:00]  fighters  that's why  you got all  them Russians  Puerto Ricas  can fight  because you  see the dudes  with the  boxing glove  tattoos  on their  neck  and the  whole  thing  but right  now  Mexicans  are the  baddest  dudes  but let  me tell  you  Russians  too  though  the  next  in  line  Latinos  you're  not gonna  really  get to  reap the  benefits  of full  oppression  till you  join together  and pick  a color  that I  can  completely  put you  all  in a 
[01:48:30]  generalization  rod base  where I  can make  a sweeping  generalization  oh man  hey look  we gotta  take a  break  and when  we get  back  we're  gonna  deal with  Snoop Dogg  and Martha  Stewart  cooking  oh my  goodness  Snoop  I already  know where  this is  going  I think  alright  Obi and  Anthony  yeah 
[01:49:00]  if you're  listening to  the show  and you  don't hear  Obi and  Anthony  it's because  we're not  here  but Patrice  O'Neill  is  yeah  so listen  to him  let me  give you  a little  synopsis  of the  show  bitches  suck  whitey  sucks  whitey  sucks  Patrice  rules  repeat  I guess  the only  thing I  didn't say 
[01:49:30]  is bitches  suck  whiteys  do suck  John  John  in Red  Bank  Patrice  I want to  know  can white  people get  basketball  back  we'll give  you hockey  see  I looked  at  wait a minute  I looked  at what  you  and this  is very  fair  but you  got to  understand  you had  it all  then  and the  ultimate  reason is  you had  to give  it up  because  you wanted  to win  and we  were just  better at 
[01:50:00]  it  if you  really  want it  back  but just  imagine  how awful  it would  be  just three  points  that  would be  the brilliance  of it  just two  hands  and the  music  that's  going  Chuck  Taylor  twisted  ankles  are you  serious  between  the leg  underhand  basket  shot  I tell  you  the league's 
[01:50:30]  free throw  shooting  percentage  will be  98%  it would  be 98%  look  for me  to be able  to get  racism  but I  don't think  we'd be  able to  do  but I  feel  you  but you  gotta  understand  you used  to run  it  and look  what  happened  I got  you  there  but if  you're  gonna  take  cop  and  fire  then  can  we  have  garbage  man  and  traffic  cop  yeah  yeah  you'll  try it  out  I  don't  know  that  you'll  do  cop  and  fire 
[01:51:00]  better  all  I  can  do  is  say  that  we  will  not  not  put  out  white  fires  we will  put  out  we  will  be  fair  to  white  we will  not  get  any  type  of  revenge  that's  what  provision  I'll  put  in  the  contract  save  all  white  babies  and  burning  buildings  let's  clear  these  out  wait  a minute  mark  how are  you  hello  how are  you sir  yes

[02:05:00]  were killing  time  talking about  the most  useless  app on  their  iphone  well  of course  I can't  play that  game  because I  got a  blackberry  you gotta  have  an iphone  and get  your apps  we got  a blackberry  coming out  later this  this season  by the end  of the year  that's going  to take  on the  iphone  there's  too many  great  expandable  things  with the  apps  on the  iphone  the iphone  has got  a lot  of things  it needs  to work  on  but  it's  at the  beginning  of it  it's  just  the second  generation  and  with these  apps  that they 
[02:05:30]  put out  it's  unlimited  I mean  people are  making their  own  they put  them on  there  some are  cool  some are  lame  but  Travis  is like  the app  king  he just  comes  it's like  he goes  I got a  new app  I'm like  what  what is  it  and it's  like  TVI  is that  it  and  you  can  just  punch  in  and see  what  TV shows  are on  whatever  time  it's  ITV  ITV  and then  you just  email yourself  you hit  watch  and it'll  email you  when that  show is on  as a little  reminder  it'll show  you when it's on  again  that's cool 
[02:06:00]  that's cool  so we're talking  about cool  apps that we  have for the  iphone  but then I'm  thinking  what's the  most like  useless app  that you  downloaded  for your  iphone  like  just  the  dumb  ones  and  um  bobby  bobby  downloaded  koi pond  koi pond  it's just  what  what is it  bob  it's  it's  it's  actually  uh  koi fish  swimming  around  in water  but you  can  touch  the  screen  and  it  has  you  can  you  have  crickets 
[02:06:30]  and you  hear  the  crickets  see  when you  touch  the  screen  see  I  didn't  even  go  for  the  koi  mine's  more  useless  than  yours  I  just  have  something  called  liquid  and  all  it  is  is  a  image  of  liquid  on  some  kind  of  background  and  then  I  touch  it  so  what  does  it  do  that's  all  it  does  it  the  liquid  moves  around  with  your  finger  as  it  touches  the  screen  and  it  makes  watery  sound  you  bought  a tub  yeah  I 
[02:07:00]  bought  something  that  might  help  me  go  to  the  bathroom  if  I'm  a little  shy  see  the  whole  thing  about  the  iPhone  that  makes  it  the  best  phone  is  it's  you  know  an  internet  communicator  a phone  and  an  iPod  but with  this  app  it's  also  a  cowbell  right in  your pocket  he's got  a cowbell  could you  please put  the speaker  though by  the thing  and not  the cowbell  wow  that's  he's  tapping  it's a  picture of  a cowbell 
[02:07:30]  he taps  it and  it makes  the sound  of a  cowbell  it's  amazing  I'm  running out  and getting  my iPhone  today  I didn't  know you  could do  all this  great stuff  Travis useless  app  well  you never  know when  you're going  to need  a fake  zippo  it's  a picture  of a  lighter  okay  and what  does it  do  well you  flick it  open  yeah  and it's  a flame  that is  completely  useless  that's  crazy  why would  you have  a simple  lighter  when I'm  at a  concert  now  I don't  have to  waste  my  lighter  fluid 
[02:08:00]  you can  just  hold it  oh  look  hey  wait a  minute  stunt  brain's  got a  little flame  on his  too  he's just  got the  gas  the  Bunsen  Burner  type  flame  I have  the worst  game  ever  all it is  is a  cannon  and you  have to  aim it  either high  or low  over the  mountain  and you  hit a  button  that's  horrible  that's  all it  does  what a  stupid  app  the  virus  negative  202  serious  197  hit me  it's the  worst  of the  O.P. and 
[02:08:30]  Anthony  show  you guys  address  Tony and  Pat's  situation  no  we were  too scared  they're both  in today  they're both  in today  Jimmy  so I think  this is  something  I don't want  it to be  ugly  but you  mentioned  Tony  I hope  there's  Fisticuffs  how are you  where is the  Pat Duffy  I think he's  out there  signing  wow stickers  I don't  Pat  sit down  I heard  we were 
[02:09:00]  doing that  bee thing  earlier  which was  a big  hit  on today's  show  and I  heard  that you  were very  sad  because you  want to  save the  honeybees  well yeah  the honeybees  are dying  at an  alarming  rate  yeah  yes  oh right  he's a  nature  guy  and he  punches  people  that  happen  to  throw  cups  on the  ground  is  that  why  you  had  a  problem  with  that  guy  because  he  littered  right  yeah  Tony  what do  you  think  of Pat  wanting  to save  the bees  I think  it's ridiculous  I probably  and I  meant to  tell you  this but  I haven't  talked to  you since  this weekend  I was  driving  my Tahoe 
[02:09:30]  which is  like 8  cylinders  and I was  eating  Slim Jims  and throwing  wrappers out  the window  I was thinking  of you  the whole  time I was  doing it  of course  you were  wait till  I tell  Duffy  what's going  on with you  two  you alright  now  I'm okay  I guess  I don't know  are these  two okay  I don't know  they still  hate each other  I haven't seen  them since  Kenny you do  realize we're  doing a radio  show right  you're whispering  as we're  trying to talk  to him  would you  like a  beverage  did you 
[02:10:00]  did you  see the  bee movie  no  I didn't  Zink  nice  that was  the good  thing to  say  yeah  that explains  everything  there's nothing  to worry  about with  bees  put my  blueberries  down  thank you  you're  holding them  what you  swear  I mean  what am I  going to do  I mean  there's going  to be no  physical  this is like  a reality  show here  people are  just go  to each  other  to hit  each  other  so they  don't  have  a job  there's going  to be no  physical  violence  I don't see  physical  violence  well 
[02:10:30]  I'm saying  there was  a little  confrontation  I don't think  it's going to  go to physical  violence  but if you  know  in terms of  the  Sam show  it was a  matter of  yeah I felt  like he was  in my  territory  and he  shouldn't have  been there  and he  opened his  mouth  and I  had to  defend  my  turf  that's  how I  felt  the  Sam  show  Pat Duffy's  a big star  in the  Sam  show  he came  to his  first one  the past  one  that's  where the  argument  came from 
[02:11:00]  so the  big argument  is you  guys are  arguing who  should be  hired first  right  yeah  now his  argument  is  what I  do  isn't as  good as  what he  does  and vice  versa  and we  go back  and forth  and  it's up  to you  guys  I don't  know  I'm not  going to  hit him  I eat  asshole  who eats  asshole  that's  that's the  famous clip  from  Thane and  Sam  oh  damn it  what happens 
[02:11:30]  when they're  not labeled  you're not  going to  hit Pat  it's okay  no I'm not  going to  hit Pat  but if I  throw something  on the  ground  he comes  after me  I can't  promise  anything  are you  afraid of  Pat  no  what are you  kidding me  afraid of  Pat  he gets  some rage  going  though  we had him  shaking really  good  Jimmy you  missed this  Robert Kelly  pushed his  buttons to the  point he got  really shaky  and freaked out  he was yelling  at him to get  mad and then  he started  throwing things  at Pat  until Pat  was shaking  uncontrollably  he's got real  problems  oh you didn't 
[02:12:00]  hear the  construction worker  story  yeah I did  oh you were  here for that  I agree with  Pat on that  although his  methods were  a little rough  but I agree  with him  Sam  what's going  on here  with these  two  Sam  please  contribute  well  Tony also  felt like  uh  Than and I  hadn't given  him a fair  shake  because he  felt like  we were  leaning more  towards Pat  Duffy's  side  um  they haven't  spoken at all  like they  don't speak  when they're  here  and they're  trying to  avoid the  issue  because  Tony  Tony says  that he  has done  more  for longer 
[02:12:30]  and believes  that all  Pat does  is shit  stunts  right  shit stunts  are good  whereas Pat  says  but what about  him stapling  his forehead  see this is  my staple gun  that was pretty  impressive  all the stunts  are good for  the show  they're all  entertaining  yeah  but my point  is if you're  hiring for  a position  I mean  really  you could  get like  who's the  kid  Magoo  who drank  his puke  you can give  him like a  t-shirt  and he'd do  anything Duffy  would do  there's no  I mean  like it's  hard to  find people 
[02:13:00]  who are  skilled and  creative  and you  know  can write  like anything  basically  for a show  and you  could get  a fan  give him  something  and he'll  pretty much  do that  so that's  my argument  yeah Tony's  argument is that  I'm a super  fan and that  I only do  things to  impress you  guys  I don't  think that's  true  but Tony  Tony thinks  that he has  the creative  mind  whereas Pat  Duffy is  just kind of 
[02:13:30]  doing whatever  you guys would  tell him  Tony looks at  it like it's  Lugosi and  Karloff  like that way  where Bella  Lugosi looked  at it like  anyone could  do that  but here I  am  I'm saying  I'm just  saying  if we were  both gone  tomorrow  he is  ten times easier  to replace  than I am  all you gotta  do is search  I bet you  one of these  five guys  out here  to get on  the radio  would rub  some shit  on their head  make a shit  happen  I don't agree  with that  yeah it's a tough  one 
[02:14:00]  Pat's  above and beyond  guy  you know  he's no  you know  something  you know Dave  I don't know  he's beating  Dave in the shit  thing  he brushed  his teeth  and shit  with dog shit  which is one  thing  Dave took  shit  out of his  ass  and licked  it off  his fingers  child's play  he brushed  his teeth  with the shit  of another  species  I cross  species lines  Dave  his own shit  is the safest 
[02:14:30]  shit  I think Dave  is great  but your own  shit  is the safest  shit  Dave would eat  any shit  is that a famous  quote  who said that  that was said  in the  revolutionary war  it was  give me liberty  or give me death  and then your own  shit is the safest  shit was overshadowed  because the guy  with give me liberty  give me death  yelled it louder  to a PA system  in the 1700s  yeah  it's from a long  long  so what bits  have you brought  that we've done  because we did  do show theater  you've been there 
[02:15:00]  for two years  right  yeah I mean  there's a ton  of writing  I've since  I mean the first  the first month  I was here  I was getting  stuff produced  I mean  ever since then  to all the way  now  I mean  I just  before I knew  how to do  the actual production  I would give it  to Steve or Derek  and they would make it  and then all the way  up till now  I mean  dozens  you know  and then I pull  audio for  whatever stories  I give it to you guys  I did some Larry King  a lot of  news anchor flubs  over the years  I mean  I don't want to  it sounds  what are some 
[02:15:30]  of the production  pieces  I'd like to know  what are some  of the things  you wrote for  well  all right  let me think  I got the  they did the two  the two douche chill  things that when I  first came here  I wrote  there was a promo  about something  like Dice said  something  I wrote that  I used his quote  and made fun of it  and we wrote  and there was a promo  for that  it's hard to put me  on the spot  I can write it down  and come back to you  in five minutes  you're being vague  though  because hold on  in two years  it's just nervous 
[02:16:00]  well I'm not going  to be able to think  of it  and I'm going to  come off like  an asshole  you know  like tooting my  own horn too  for anything  I've done  Dice promo  when you first  got here  so two years ago  and hold on  two installations  of douche chill  theater  I would say  probably  eight to ten  news anchor  flubs I've done  that have been  played on air  I found them  myself  and gotten them  to there  you could ask  Danny  usually give them  to Danny  and he reads  oh you're saying  usually I give them 
[02:16:30]  to Danny  and Danny  like takes credit  for him  no no no  he's right  that happened  once or twice  all right  once or twice  the CD I gave him  that he played  the one day  he had three on  so I don't know  yeah and like  two we already had  so  Danny's very good  with audio  so I  yeah  he's the best  yeah Danny  that's his thing  he finds it  weird  I'm not discrediting  Tony at all  he's handed  one a couple  of things  but literally  it was a couple  of things  okay  a couple 
[02:17:00]  of things  okay  I'd like to  disagree with that  but yeah  well hold on  let's work it out  that's what we're here for  it's fine  defend yourself  I am  I think it's eight or ten  I probably can find them  in my folder right now  and pull them out  I save everything  Duffy what  are you holding back  any stunts  well I tried to  the last time I was  in this with the thumbtacks  but that was  that was a no go  really  he's got a  he's got a thumbtack  a bit  yeah  what's that one  well I always have  about 400 thumbtacks 
[02:17:30]  in my backpack  at any given time  in case you want to  make a thumbtack bat  or things like that  in case you want to  do something like that  thumbtack bat  why would you just  like  better to have him  and not need him  exactly  spontaneously  who knows why  we would need it  but I have it  you're like James Bond  or something  no he's like a  cartoon character  right  I need thumbtacks  to sprinkle on the floor  yeah  I mean that's just  I don't know  that's just a stunt  I guess  I mean I wanted to do the  I wanted to test out  the pain index  of the stings  I wanted to do each one 
[02:18:00]  let's have him  get stung by something  while we have  EMS here  on the helping  with the honeybees  you can  you can offer  to keep bees  so that you can  raise honeybees  and I was thinking  about doing that  in the city Pat  no I live in  New Jersey  yeah  in Brooklyn  you're gonna raise  honeybees now  I was thinking about it  what the hell's going on  you can't just  decide you're gonna  raise honeybees  why not  cause there's all  kinds of equipment  you need  and education  and  details  and some flowers  details  here you go  shit dicks 
[02:18:30]  fucking pollinate  right there  this is all you need  I'm going to work  so Tony  you gotta defend yourself  better  we got so far  in two years  24 months  two installations  of new shit  like that  a dice promo  two years ago  and a couple of pulls  you say  Danny says it was  a couple of things  and you say it was  ten  you'll take ten  I've uh  two months  a couple times  that I've been on air  I've been on air  for over an hour  the first time  and over an hour  and a half  which gives  a lot of radio  I did all those bits 
[02:19:00]  I wrote  that I read to you guys  in the office  you liked every one of them  I read them on the air  you liked them all  two and a half hours  on air  I'm fucking adding this up  hold on  I want to break this down  by  we have to do this fairly  because we'll go over  W stuff too  24 months  let's just say 10 bits  I'm going to give you  the benefit of the doubt  I'm going to say  Danny's player Hayton  if you can forgive the term  that's one audio poll  every two months  now two and a half hours 
[02:19:30]  on the air  Stan  you want to break out  the old calculator  oh shit  what  24 months  let's just do  two and a half hours  that's 120  150 minutes  150 minutes  and two years  is  24 months  add this on too  we're just doing this  one thing at a time  this is obviously  going to add up  what's that  I can't figure out  my calculator  I know you can't  sweetie  I knew this would be  a problem  that's why I'm opening mine 
[02:20:00]  it's way less than  a minute a day  6.25  what seconds a day  minutes per month  there you go  6.5  minutes per  how much  6.25  6.25  so  6.25  divided by 30  no divided by  4  let's just go weeks  ok  that's  1.56  now divide that by 5  because that's days  uh huh  0.3  so it's minutes  so it's about 30  no  like 20 seconds 
[02:20:30]  yeah  0.3  of a minute  so 20 seconds  20 seconds  a day  ok  20 seconds a day  20 seconds of airtime  a day  alright  put your heads up  I mean you know  boom  alright  smartass  and meanwhile  I got mentioned  three times  on the FM show  today  just  well that's cause  you're sticking  your nose in  every two minutes  am I ever  am I ever  in there  first of all  fucking stunt brain  took my seat  am I ever  in the studio  oh  no  not stunt brain 
[02:21:00]  stunt brain  he's already a problem  took your seat  yeah  I always sit there  you don't like that  well  not really  what are you gonna do  about it  probably nothing  stunt brain's ass  just attack him  so you think  that he's basically  buffalo on his way in  well no  I mean  like  the big thing  was he almost  got into a tussle  out on the streets  in New York  like if every time  I had a problem  at a bar or something  or I smacked  somebody in the mouth  I came in here  I'd be barging my way  on every month  or so  it's ridiculous 
[02:21:30]  fucking tough guy theater  no I don't do it  I don't act like  a tough guy  and throw water bottles  you know  get all upset about it  and I don't bring it up  cause I don't feel like  nobody gives a shit  well I don't like litter bugs  that's alright  see there are certain things  though where you say  like I don't feel like  anyone gives a shit  but Pat Duffy  attacking a construction worker  for throwing a bottle  he realized that's good radio  so  it also makes you realize  that he's unstable  and he probably shouldn't be  well perhaps  you're right  but look around this joint  who is stable 
[02:22:00]  but you also did say  that you smack people  in the mouth at a bar a lot  that's not a sign of stability  well not a lot  I'm saying  it has to come to that  it has to come to that  I don't go around  looking for it  and then I don't bring it up either  Tony threatened to slap me  in the mouth  on the Thannis Ham show  it's for radio  oh okay  are you afraid of Tony?  no  not at all  why do you laugh  when you say that  that's kind of  awkward for everybody  why would I be afraid of Tony?  he's a big kid  he's probably a powerful dude  right  but if you just get a little quicker  then we can't catch up 
[02:22:30]  it's not hard to outrun  a huge  huge dude  huge  I said huge  would you run away from him?  well  depends if he came after me  like it was Cloverfield  coming after me  are you calling Tony  a big monster?  perhaps  listen  sorry  I'm like 8-0  on the streets  Duffy  anytime you want to come at me  maybe take a shot  at the fucking title  you come at me  you want to go punch for punch?  you can't punch for punch  punch in a place like this  alright  what do you want to do?  because it's going to turn into  listen 
[02:23:00]  I don't play fight  if you hit me  I'm going to choke the shit out of you  until you're unconscious  and that's the end of it  I consider it an attack  and I'm going to not stop  until you're passed out  or immobilized  that's the end of it  I don't fight for fun  when I have slap box  no  we might as well run fucking races  you want to do that?  yes  I win  100 meter dash  let's do it  how about a push up contest?  alright  what's punch for punch?  in the face?  why not?  no  in the face?  well I would go for the face  great idea 
[02:23:30]  thank you  the arm maybe  wow that would be over real quick I think  yeah  I don't know with who  but punch for punch  if you just like wound up and hit somebody  I think the first punch is over  there would be one punch  and then there would be a melee  and that would be the end of that  yeah  yeah because you wouldn't go punch for punch  no  if anybody touch it  if you touch me  I'd defend myself  and that would be the end of it  yeah  could kick his ass you think?  if I had to  yeah I could take Duffy 
[02:24:00]  you could take Duffy?  no  the cycle factor only goes so far  Duffy you think you could beat him?  I think Tony could beat me up  but I would stab him  oh so now you're talking like attempted murder  instead of just a gentleman's kind of a fight  well he wouldn't stab him to kill him  we all know that  just hurt him really badly  yeah  like prison shanking  exactly  in the ass like five times real quick  he would stab his elbow  because that would hurt a lot  yeah  Brian from St. Louis  the stars of this show  hate vacuums  walk around the house naked with guns 
[02:24:30]  and pay people to shit on them  where's the fucking stability on this show?  walk around naked with guns  that was so true  no one could even laugh  like that was so accurate  it just hurt all of our feelings  it was  right  I know  how about a dick measuring contest?  oh I'm up for it  they don't call me old ruler mouth for nothing  I'm just kidding  I don't want to suck on his dick  Ricky M from Massachusetts  suggests that  someone's getting excited  this Tony Pat Duffy thing 
[02:25:00]  this is just like Thrilla in Manila  I gotta tell you  this is just amazing radio  well we got some  Tony was giving us a list of things he's done  it's just incredible  it doesn't have to be a fight  this thing is really escalating  right in front of our eyes  I don't know what to do next with this  oh my god  Tony I want to know  because you are defending yourself  you gotta list stuff  I mean but Pat  let me tell you something  on air stuff is hard to top  Pat's done  baby bird  Pat do an on air stunt today  he's done the staple in the head  he's done brush the teeth with dog shit  he's done the fucking homeless mustache with dog shit  would you staple your nostrils together? 
[02:25:30]  yeah  yeah let's do that  that could be fun  what?  why don't we shave that beard off  because everybody hates  and then you can eat that beard  but I like it  yeah but nobody likes in the office  sorry  shave it off  nobody likes it  put it on a sandwich  and you get eaten  no thanks  it's a great stunt for you  oh yeah  riveting  see I'm writing for you  oh thanks  eat the beard  he's frustrated that obviously  Pat does the big stunts  Pat gets the attention  yeah  whereas he thinks he does more and better work 
[02:26:00]  but he doesn't get the recognition  because it's behind the scenes  right  I'm not  I'm not saying what he does on the air  is not good for the show  of course everybody knows  it's good for the show  it's great radio  but I just think  it's not  compared to  the creative side  of radio  it pales in comparison  because other people  could do it  Danny thoughts  well it's  you know  he's right in a sense  because there are two different  there are two different  sides of radio  there's like the stunt boy side 
[02:26:30]  and then there's the creative side  and I think that  Pat Duffy excels  on the stunt boy side  and I think that  Tony  Tony excels  on the creative side  don't I do a pretty good job  for you on Saturday nights  well you do  but I mean  you're not  you're not being creative  doesn't that count for something  you're hitting buttons  alright  I appreciate  I appreciate your work ethic  I think it's fantastic  I've done 15 shows  on a Saturday night  yeah for Than and Sam  when have you come in  for when I need you  on a Saturday  oh  yeah I'm here every Saturday  times are tough 
[02:27:00]  I had to sell  I had to sell my old man's  copper wire  to come here today  copper wire  well I'm just saying  you managed to come in  for every Than and Sam show  so I bet if I asked you  to come in this Saturday  for Laszlo  are you going to come in  I'm busy this weekend  I would  I would  if I wasn't doing anything  case closed  you never ask me anymore  I would  alright well  it's my birthday weekend  and I'm coming in  he barely comes in  for this show  who Tony  yeah he's here like  maybe one  one and a half day a week  well I'm here two days a week  at least this week  I didn't come in  because I didn't have any money  I'm looking for a new job  but other than that 
[02:27:30]  I'm in Tuesday  I'm in Tuesday and Thursday  that's enough time  for me to create  when you can  I know we don't have any interns  I don't know why  I'm not shitting on you  I mean I know you don't get paid  and it's tough coming in here  I mean I was in the same boat  that you were four years ago  I was coming for free  I was picking pennies  out of my chick's pocketbook  so I could get bus fare  you know what I mean  I was in the same boat  so I understand  I know what you mean  but you know  it just so happens  that Pat Duffy can get here  more often than you  and sometimes in that  kind of an environment  unfortunately the FaceTime  wins out over the guy  who's here twice a week 
[02:28:00]  yeah we see Pat Duffy's face  every morning  well I mean  I come over here  I can come to K-Rock  I can come in the studio  I'll do a lap  and then I can come back here  this way everybody knows I'm here  Sam threw his arms up in the air  in his aspirations  it's the ninth time  we've told you  to just come to CBS  so people know you're here  yeah but that's the thing  it's a waste of the company's time  for me to go over there  and walk around for a little bit  and then come  to do something there  no it's not  it's not a waste of time  for you to sit over there  and if Jim needs coffee  then if I gotta wait  another ten minutes  I don't answer to you 
[02:28:30]  don't tell me what the hell  shut your face  everyone else gets to be suggesting  I'll listen fine  but you be quiet  Tony what is it that you're doing here  that you can't do there  well first of all  I did like 200 FU calls today  that's first of all  alright but we have computers there  like you can do stuff there  I can't get on  there's no computers over there  I can do it on  bullshit  there's three different  what did I tell you  fucking  stop to Zito  shut up  I told  I told fucking  wait what did he say  I told Derek  that you know  I'll do the FU calls 
[02:29:00]  or whatever  and he sets me up  and it's done  quick  over there  everybody's booting me  off the computer  cause I can't get in  the FU calls  I don't have the password  what they give you the password  cause you have shit on your head  I don't have the password  I don't have anything  I got nothing in this place  wow  face right there  yeah  that's a bit of a face  a little bit  oh the crowd's still chuckling  Pat Duffy's getting angry  think honeybees  honeybees  I know right  they're so  cute honeybees  you know what I'm gonna do 
[02:29:30]  to them  I'm gonna go home  I'm gonna get a long stick  I'm gonna find like  one of them little nests  you're gonna eat it  springtime nests  I'm gonna knock that  fucking nest out of a tree  and them little tiny  blue eggs  I'm gonna smash them  alright  good for you  maybe I'll eat them  like little blue M&M's  I'll fucking eat them  what the honeybees  have cute little blue eggs  for some reason  honeybees have blue eggs  they're them stupid robins  I know you like them  even more than the bees  gonna kill every robin nest  they see this summer  all for you  so you think that he 
[02:30:00]  could be doing stuff  over at CBS  like on the computers  yes  I didn't know that  there's no reason  for him to just sit  over here and claim  that he can't go over  to CBS  there's plenty of  computers for you to use  over there  I know  but why would I go  to that crowded ass  office and be in  everybody's way  when I got a free  computer over here  three computers  because there's other  shit to be done  over there while  you're doing that work  I've been doing work  getting sandwiches  yes I've been working  for Will Chapman  all year over there  and then Jim needs coffee  I'll go get Jim coffee  somebody else  I got Jim coffee last week  my coffee was better  mixed than yours 
[02:30:30]  fuck you  I never know  who brings me the coffee  it's just delicious  every time  yeah Jimmy doesn't even  know you're alive  that's just the reality  of it unfortunately  no I know Tony  I know Tony  I never know  who's doing my call  but I see Duffy Moore  but that's right  Danny's right  what do you like  better there Jimmy  I've gotten to know  Duffy Moore  but I like Tony  but if I had to choose  on air stuff to me  is extraordinarily valuable  but I have to say  I'm not aware of all  the behind the scenes  shit for real  because I don't do  production  so like for me  audio just magically 
[02:31:00]  appears  I don't see the  hours of fucking  hunting that goes into it  right  so I'm aware  there's a lot of shit  that goes on  that I don't know  how to do  I don't know  how to do production  all I just do  is come here  and I just brighten  everybody's day  I mean I don't  like does the sun  know everything  the sun does  of course not  I shine here  so as much as  I'm partial to Duffy  I can't shit on  what Tony does either  because there may be  very valuable stuff  I'm not aware of  said the wishy-washy 
[02:31:30]  faggot  oh you see that  Derek's coming  with his gorgeous  fuckable boy legs  tattooed  tattooed boy legs  what's up Derek  what do you got on this  what are you guys  actually talking about  wow  just basically  Tony and Duffy  are kind of having  their whole thing again  about who's more  valuable  and who does what  I mean you know  you see it all  when Tony comes over here  Tony helps me out  a lot actually  doing the FU calls  if I'm working on a bit  or something  I need something 
[02:32:00]  pulled from the internet  I can tell him  where to go  and he'll grab me  some audio  cut it up for me  and give it to me  on a CD  what about Duffy  Duffy does the same  thing too  so it's basically  whichever one's around  Tony does a little  better job than Duffy  in doing it  but  who would you rather  see  point Tony  I mean I don't know  why is it up to me  I'm just curious  well it kind of is  just an opinion  yeah  that's perfect smile  I mean  I kind of have to go 
[02:32:30]  with Duffy on this one  Jesus Christ  oh no  Tony what does that  mean to you  I don't know  I guess it is what it is  I figure if anybody  can count on Derek  see Duffy can learn  to do what you do  in production  and stuff  I think  it could be taught  but Duffy  the shit he's willing  to do  that can't be taught  that takes like  a certain courage  and retardation 
[02:33:00]  to be able to  actually do that  yeah bring in the  staple gun  I want to see him  staple his nostril  today  you got a staple gun  what what  I just had a post  it from a fan  and he pointed at Derek  and it said  mandals  I'm not  giving you fucking sneakers man  Jesus Christ  are you wearing mandals  no man  not today  not today  it's a little cold out  it's raining  oh okay  oh he's not even wearing them  no  because you like  making fun of them  oh okay  sorry dude  that's right 
[02:33:30]  I had my hopes up  to see some fucking  some pterodactyl Derek toes  and nothing more  people are suggesting  a new Tony bit  Les A from Chicago  writes  new bit  environmentally unfriendly  Tony  I could do that  you could do that right  start today  bring in something  and just destroy it  in front of Tony  in front of Pat  a Robin's nest  would be a good start  I'm thinking  I'll come up with  something good  yeah something really  heinous to an  environmentalist  or something  yeah  can I say that Derek 
[02:34:00]  didn't say like  fuck Tony  he just said  he thinks  he kind of said  eat a baby seal  with a dolphin  that is fucking  kick ass  wouldn't it  can you like  staple your nostril  yeah I'm waiting  I'm gonna get the  stapler right now  yeah  it's gonna hurt though  dude that's bad  yeah that is really  go get the stapler boy  go get it  go get the stapler boy  what  he said go get the  staple boy  but he said like  you're a dog  but see you're out  out of the studio  so you didn't hear him  say that  oh okay  I said go get the 
[02:34:30]  staple boy  I'm not allowed to  who says you're not  allowed to  I just got yelled at  by a bunch of people  telling me not to  who's the bunch of  people  I just heard Danny  that was the one  voice I heard  Steve what are you  doing Steve  I'm just making sure  he can't staple  his nostrils  he can staple  his nostrils  why can't he  staple his nostrils  because I'm not  taking him to the  fucking emergency  room again  you don't have to  yeah that's actually  what I have to do  when you hurt yourself  intentionally  is take you to the  fucking emergency room  which I am not  doing again  thank you very much  do not staple  your fucking nose  wow  wait a minute 
[02:35:00]  because you  apparently didn't hear  it the first  fucking time you  got told  I have a bit  that might work  how about  this hurt me  when I was a boy  and I don't know  if it'll hurt you  but if you take  freshen up toothpaste  and you take a dollop  and you rub it  in your asshole  alright  I have toothpaste  in my backpack  oh steve's giving us  a thumbs up  thanks steve  that's okay  I have a brush  you can use this  I do  get me stunt brain  he'll bring Pat Duffy  to the emergency room  where's the toothpaste  let's try that  what kind do you have  though  I have some  I don't know 
[02:35:30]  it might not burn  this might be a total bust  but when I was a boy  and I was at Marvin  Schnell's house  and my asshole  was very sore though  because it was raw  so this may not hurt  from a man's penis  no  taking massive dumps  I didn't wipe good enough  that acidy shit  hanging there  burning away  at your asshole  I got a salt and vinegar  chip in between  my boyish cheeks  what do you got  Pat Duffy  I have  Arm & Hammer  baking soda  advanced white  toothpaste  but that's not 
[02:36:00]  as a really  you need that minty  you need mint  alright  well this is what I had  how about someone  goes and gets freshen up  it's got to be  right around the corner  because I'm the only  intern here  or icy hot  that'll work too  oh Jesus  alright let's do  some icy hot  Jimmy  you apply  I will  not because it'll  hurt my dick  swim walk  oh no you didn't  oh shit  you motherfucking  got a dick choking  alright we're just  being ridiculous today  alright well  why not  why not  why not  alright  you're in my  fucking asshole  Tony comment  thank you 
[02:36:30]  see I don't  wait Tony has a comment  though  Tony  Tony go ahead  I'm just waiting  I'm just waiting  for the big  the big thing  that's all  here's the thing  with this whole thing  I don't  I don't mind  doing this  but this just  cements Tony's  point  that I just  do stunts  yeah but people  will be talking  about Pat  fucking Duffy  and in the end  that's all  we're looking for  in the show  it doesn't matter  cementing Tony's  point or making  your point  are not relevant  in the sense  that what we  look for  is what helps  the show more  that's the goal  of all of us  like again 
[02:37:00]  I bring just  my thing  and Opie and  Anthony bring  their thing  everyone brings  their own thing  to the show  so it doesn't  matter if Tony's  point is right  and your point  is wrong  yeah  you understand  what I'm saying  it's irrelevant  it's what  like right now  the listeners  are listening  to the show  right  besides the  battle  of what I'm  saying  they're waiting  to hear something  alright  so Tony brought  in his bit  he put a bit  Masterpiece  Rob Deuce  there  with Fat Bob Kelly  so now you have  to do a bit  as well  alright well  before I can do 
[02:37:30]  a stunt  I did bring  another bit  can we try this  first  can we try this  first  yes we can  which bit  this is a  list of botched  executions  that I found  I don't know  if you want to  read through them  oh he's handing out  freaking  dinners and everything  oh wow  and then I also  have another list  of the top 20  torture devices  but I picked  out my favorites  oh wow  look at this  now I don't  know what you  guys can do 
[02:38:00]  with them  but I felt  that it was  interesting  hold on now  this one  I wouldn't say  this is a bit  as much as I  would put the  asterisk next to  it and call it  a food for thought  it's material  yeah it's just  something to  read through  and hopefully  we are talented  enough to  make it sound  good  yeah you can't  just lob up  softball at the  gifted ones  well what would  you what would  you do with  this  well 
[02:38:30]  for example  like  what I would  do with them  is like  just the  descriptions of  these torture  devices  were enough  to cause  you know  cringe factor  all over  anybody that's  listening  yeah  anyway that  can  go it  you  I can't  I'm sweating  it's you  well I don't  want to read  any  why that's  your bit  it's your bit  Pat  you can't  read  you're not  just a stunt  guy  you don't  just hand  dittos out  did you  I know  but I  but I  didn't  I don't  know  what  enjoy it  seriously  I'm not  fucking  with you  Tony did  his thing  no I'm not  he produced  it 
[02:39:00]  and he did  the thing  so he's  saying that  you can't  enjoy  fucking  whatever  just talk  about it  I just  say  clicking  print  is not  creating  I can  look up  I can  look up  stories  all day  you know  what's wrong  Pat  do that  nothing  there's no way  I'm gonna win  in a war  of words  you want me  to read it  I'll read it  give me that  thing  I'll fucking  read it  what the fuck  are you laughing  at  it's funny  it's a comedy  show  oh shit

[02:43:00]  it's fucking  crazy right  oh  you can like  pick it up  mess with it  and put it  down and then  you forgot  what happened  you're so  right Tony  you're so  right  you know  animals  the animals  that lay eggs  they don't  even have  belly buttons  it's crazy  what  yeah  what's that  all about  no umbilical cord  right  nope  wow  that's a  great fact  oh you guys  you guys  done digressing 
[02:43:30]  I'll move on  I got plenty  of them  I think  these are  factoids  just hit Pat  with another  piece of paper  Sam  no  Pat could  control himself  though  Pat's fine  yeah  do another  one  oh  that's annoying  he's bouncing  around his  fucking head  alright  do one  to Tony  though  I'm kind  of in the  middle  reading a bit  ah  jeez  crazy  Sam  he's a  character  you're like  Sam  he's throwing  stuff at 
[02:44:00]  people  Pat doesn't  like this  he's being  abused by  Sam  with the  paper  and  he's not  like in  the limelight  here  being outshined  by Tony  a little  bit  yeah  this is  fine  but Pat  knows that  he does  crazy  things  and he  loves  doing  that  but he  also  knows  that  he has  thoughts  and he  has  things  that he  wants to  do  that are  not  crazy  and he  feels like  he's not  being taken  seriously  and he  feels like  he brought  something to  the table  bit wise  and he's  being mocked  and shit's  being lobbed  at him  it's a good  bit  we did  this at  AAF  10 years  ago  he feels 
[02:44:30]  like this  is my  lot in  life  it's a  compliment  I'm just  kidding  you feel like  you bring  something in  you want to  at least be  addressed  seriously  on some  level  yeah I guess  I don't  know  this is  really  uncomfortable  for me  why  is that  uncomfortable  because  I just  want to  leave  right now  just get  up  and leave  put something  in your  ass  you'll  feel right  at home  that was  bad  well  no I'm  just trying  to make  it feel  comfortable  I didn't  mean that  like 
[02:45:00]  disrespectfully  forgive me  if I  if you  know  if it  came off  that way  it's right  out of  paper  oh  shit  throw one  more thing  throw one  more thing  let's see  should I  do it  can you  duck  fast  Duffy's  holding a  fucking  time  warner  remote  and I  don't  think he  wants to  change  the channel

[02:46:30]  was  just  rage  pure  rage  wow  Sam  you  are  fucked  man  that  guy  could  rip  you  to  pieces  I  don't  know  what  happened  he  threw  a  stapler  at  Sam's  head  was  that  a  stapler  or  yes  I  don't  know  it was  the  remote  and then  Sam decided  that he  needed to  hit him  one more  time  it was  too  wimpy  of a  throw  wow  holy shit  what did he do  I gotta go talk 
[02:47:00]  to him  I think he's  taking out the  recycling  he just  kicked a  bunch of  shit  I don't  know  Pat's  got like  very short  temper  he certainly  does  very short  tempered  Pat  and I  don't  think  he  can  take  that  kind  of  abuse  yeah  man  I  thought  he  could  go  with  the  bit  other  people  can  do  that  he  takes  it  very  seriously  he  doesn't  play  games  dude  if he  got a hold  of you  I know  you were  getting punched  so bad  in the face 
[02:47:30]  he was  fighting back  trying to get  away from  Poe  like  Poe put  him in  like  a choke  hold  I would  have bled  a lot  oh  yeah  you'd  have been  bleeding  we'd  probably  had to  call  the  ambulance  for  you  Pat  Duffy  I  never  saw  that  side  of  Pat  like  that  he  always  seems  like  a fun  guy  it's  in the  eyes  it's  in the  face  really  yes  I  just  thought  he  kind  of  looked  like  that  he's  a guy  that  doesn't  play  games  but  he's  not  a  tough  guy  he's  not  like  a  shit  head  but 
[02:48:00]  he's  a  guy  that  will  try  to  avoid  confrontation  right  right  I  don't  see  him  as  starting  fights  no  no  no  he's  not  unless  you  ever  seen  him  drunk  no  I  wonder  if  he  like  gets  drunk  and  decides  I'm  going to  kick  that  guy  ass  or  something  you  seem  like  a  problem  like  like  with  anybody  I  mean  when  you're  talking  about  when  drinking  I'm  like  the  nicest  guy  to  drink  with  ever  it  like  I  just  don't  start  anything  I'll  finish  it  but  I  never  start  with  anybody  you  seem  like  a  troublemaker  a little  bit  you seem 
[02:48:30]  like  a guy  that  if  I  went  to  school  with  you  you'd  hit  me  nah  you  could  push  me  really  far  before  I  even  think  about  snapping  yeah  pretty  cool  and calm  collected  they beat  me up  for two  hours  straight  on their  show  and  I  go  with  it  and  have  fun  with  it  we've  thrown  a lot  Tony  in  the  past  couple  of  years  yes  Danny  is there  a report  no  there  isn't  I  just  it  reminded  me  of  do  you  guys  remember  our  old  intern  Craig  oh  yeah  he  told me  a story  once  where  we  got him  so  mad 
[02:49:00]  one  day  that  when  he  got  back  to  his  car  he  punched  his  window  in  a  new  window  we  are  just  a  bunch  of  douche  bags  because  you  know  everyone  wanted  that  to  happen  but  not  to  that  extent  oh  yes  to  that  extent  I  wanted  to  see  Sam  get  punched  in  the  face  why  wouldn't  you  want  to  see  that  it  doesn't  matter  I  like  Pat  enough  where  I 
[02:49:30]  attack  Sam  and  punch  him  in  the  head  as  long  as  there  was  someone  to  pull  him  off  me  before  there  was  any  permanent  damage  yeah  so  it  would  be worth  it  and  Sam  would  be one  of  those  smart  asses  that  would  get  up  with  blood  coming out  of his  nose  and mouth  and then  pick a paper 
[02:50:00]  and throw  it right at  his face  again  I don't  know  about  that  Sam  when's  the  last  time  you  were  truly  decked  I've  never  been  invited  in my  life  that  would  be a  lesson  teacher  oh wow  so when  you're an  asshole to  people  you get  this ringing  sensation  in your  ears  and things  go black  for a  while  I don't  know  yeah  you don't  know  you're  gonna find  out  if you  keep  doing  shit  like  that  especially  Duffy's  meat paw  fucking  roast beef  on a  stick  oh  boy 
[02:50:30]  hopes  back  Sammy  should  took one  for the  home  team  here  where's  he  going  just  taking  one  he  should  have  just  took  one  he's  alright  what do you think  visit to hr  what's going on  nah nah  nah he's fine  he's never  rat right  he goes to another  place man  he's not leaving  is he  no  we talked  him into  coming back  up  he goes to  another place  though  you see it  in his eyes  he's somewhere  else  he's a problem  Pat you can't  fuck with Pat  he's a guy  who's  fucking  he probably  like you said  this happened  his whole life  he's had a lot  of bullshit  and he's just  a guy that  doesn't fucking 
[02:51:00]  he snaps  he has a problem  with you  yeah I know  why though  I don't know  I think he  probably had a lot  of smart asses  that picked on him  he doesn't like  when like  but he really  has a problem  with you  not just  from today  no  he has a problem  with me  from before  because Pat's  like he's smart  but he comes up  with lines  to come back  at somebody  like an hour  after it happened  so he'll be  in the car  and he'll think  of a good line  that could have  come back  so he doesn't  like it  in general  because it's not  like this is  the first time  the jerk store  called  well hold on 
[02:51:30]  wait now  can we have  can we have  Pat and Sam  just talk  no throwing shit  at him  but just  I'm willing to talk  where's Pat  could Pat  would Pat  want to talk to him  if he doesn't  fuck around  I don't want to  see Pat  snap and get in  trouble  he can't take  a ribbing  like I mean  that's the reason  I survived here  a ribbing  but he can take  a lot  I mean I gotta  stick up for Duffy  he fucking puts up  with a lot of shit  I want someone  in between us  so he's gotta be  on the other side  of the room  he won't charge  if you just  fucking  look at Sam  now 
[02:52:00]  the pussy side  of Sam  is coming through  I want him  over there  I know  Sam you alright  a little nervous  huh  no I'm good  yeah Pat's a fucking  you know  facing the tiger  now Pat  we didn't know  you had a problem  with Sam  before obviously  yeah  now what's  going on with that  he reminds you  of what  no it's just like  no matter where  you go in your life  it doesn't matter  what you do  there's always  gonna be one person  that's gonna fuck  with you  and that's Sam  here for me  from day one  Sam's been fucking  with me 
[02:52:30]  but is he fucking  with you like a buddy  fucks with somebody  or is he fucking  with you in a way  that he's kind of  like you think  he's testing your  manhood  literally he's fucking  him in the ass  it's terrible  he doesn't like it  I feel it  I just feel  they do it to me  every guy  like Danny  will walk up  instead of being  like he hasn't  seen me in a week  how you doing  he'll be like  get out of my seat  you fat fuck  you know  like on a Monday  and you know  it's just  that was just  what if the seat  asked Danny  to say something  boo  sorry guys 
[02:53:00]  slow killing  but you know what  some people can  handle that crap  and others can  and I think  it depends on  how you were brought  up  and it seems  like this brings  Pat Duffy back  to a place  that was uncomfortable  for him  but to like  re-array what Tony  said  like everybody else  fucks with everybody  around here  like Danny will say  the same shit to me  or Than will fuck  Than fucked with me  so bad recently  and then  but like when it  comes to Sam  it just gets real  he does it like  he's doing it real  to like actually  insult you  and I can't fucking  take it sometimes  he's just good at it 
[02:53:30]  I think  yeah people think  I'm insulting  I don't care about people  so I'm not insulting  anybody  it doesn't matter  to me  but I just say things  like I do like  to mess with  people's minds  and so like  I will say things  that I know  that Pat Duffy  will take to heart  because he's very sensitive  what is something  he would take to heart  don't say it to him  necessarily  but what is something  he would take to heart  no I'm serious  like not necessarily  like the insult  but is it about  you call him dumb  or you call him ugly  he doesn't have  picked on before  yeah he really doesn't  like it when people  call him dumb  or stupid  like even if you say  that was a stupid 
[02:54:00]  thing to do  or like you know  Pat the word stupid  I think it's some kind  of trigger for him  but he hates being  called stupid  where does that come  from Pat  yeah  I think it comes  from I worked  for this guy  for a little while  and everything  that I did  no matter what  I was fucking  I was stupid  and I don't like  being called stupid  do you feel like  you are  or do you feel  no I feel like  I'm quite the opposite  I'm not stupid  at all  but it's just  it's hard for me  to just say  like I heard him  say before  it's hard for me  to just be quick  on my feet verbally 
[02:54:30]  but I don't think  I come off as dumb  like sitting there  before when I was  told to explain  what I brought  I couldn't  because I just  can't think of  the way to make  it interesting  you know what I mean  and it  yeah  exactly  exactly  like I'm flaring  right now  I'm freezing up  you panic  you tend to worry  about  instead of just  doing what you gotta do  you're worrying  about how it's  gonna be interpreted  stop worrying  about the results  like the results  are beyond your control  when I was talking  to him in the  stairwell  he said to me  I'm sorry  that you didn't  like the bit  and I had explained 
[02:55:00]  to him  it's not even  about the bit  he handed us  because we  had something else  going on  our whole goal  there was to get  you to fucking react  we did our jobs  there  we wanted the big  holy shitty  fucking turn into  Hulk moment  the worst thing  you could have done  was brought a  well produced bit  nobody wanted to  hear that  who cares  not at that  moment anyway  you could have  given us  the greatest  radio bit ever  it didn't matter  because of the  timing of the  whole thing  our whole goal  was to get  some kind of 
[02:55:30]  interaction going  between you  and Tony  or well  and then  eventually Sam  obviously  I didn't know  you and Sam  had a thing  I didn't know  that  we didn't even  look at this  bit because  we're like  yeah alright  it looks like  it could be  something good  for the show  but we were  in the middle  of just trying  to get you  to fucking  lose your mind  and also  I had this  shit on the bit  because when  you look at it  fucking  fucking Tony  we broke down  to 20 good  seconds a day  we don't have to  go back to that  we already did  all of it  we basically  covered the  fucking  you know  the fucking  nonsense  he's been  fucking  passing off 
[02:56:00]  and let it be  known that  out of all  the interns  that have ever  been here  every one of them  hated you  and you hated  them  and what  did you say  about me  I like you  Tony  because I do  it in a  fucking  regular way  I don't even  buzz balls  I just come  and do my  thing  so let it be  known that  whatever happens  I'm the one  you liked  besides all  these other  fucks  all the interns  that are gone  you hated  them  and they hated  your guts  I'm the only  one who doesn't  fuck with you  that's why you  like me  you just 
[02:56:30]  have a hard time  getting fucked  with people  wait so you guys  actually like each  other  I have no problem  with Tony  but if Tony  thinks for a second  that he should be  hired before me  he's full of  fucking shit  if you guys  like each other  how about a  man on man kiss  I don't necessarily  like him  it's just that  I don't  what happened  Jimmy  you don't like him  I don't  fucking hate him  but I don't like him  put it that way  it is what it is  I don't fuck with him  he don't fuck with me  and that's the end of it  on the outside  who would you say  immediately 
[02:57:00]  just on looks  has the more  friendly look  who do you think  Jimmy  it's hard to say  man  because I see  Duffy more  so I know  he's a good dude  Duffy looks way  friendlier  in a way  but he's not like that  he's in another  world right now  I'm with the bees  right now  Tony looks scary  just when he's  just doing his  you know  just walking around  man  I would say  the friendlier  Duffy has an  innocence about him  and I think  that's why 
[02:57:30]  he does the  Amish beard  and everything  fucking else  he's like  trying to  trying to make  himself look tougher  I know you can  rip someone's head off  I'm not even  going to fucking  play  that's obvious  but I think  inside there's  like a  an innocent  a very innocent  boy  just a little  boy in there  yeah  I have no doubt  about it  yeah  so what could  Sam do to make  things like  you know  like I didn't  know you guys  like who do  you dislike the  most  Sam  wow  Jesus  no Sam  Sam's not  going to change  because Sam  is Sam  and Sam  is really good  for the show 
[02:58:00]  and what me  and Sam  shouldn't change  it's fine  but it's not  going to change  do you like  Fan  yeah I do  like Fan  Fan got me  so bad though  recently  sorry  EROC  do you like  EROC  yeah I do  a lot of work  for Eric  I'm not sure  you said  you do all  his work  figures  stop trying to  make up  stop trying to  call back  fun Pat moments  put a nice  bed under it  yeah  you doing alright  now Pat  yeah I'm a lot  better than I was 
[02:58:30]  we don't want you  running out of the  building and  I wasn't quitting  though  no but you're  running out like  King Kong  leaving the  I was going to  attack the first  person on the  sidewalk  yeah that would  have been great  someone walking  in the building  gets strangled  by Pat  probably the same  guy had mustard  poured on him  the unluckiest  patron  no one ever  had mustard  poured on him  are you crazy  that was a hell of a  shot  I thought that was  across the street  never mind  it was wonderful  spraying mustard  on that guy 
[02:59:00]  but Sam just  rubs you the wrong  way  yeah  you think  that he's kind  of shit  like he fucks  with you  not understanding  that the  consequences  are real  yeah like I  don't think  I think Sam  fucks with  everybody the same  like I don't  think Sam  singles me out  but I think  that Sam  I just take  it from Sam  a lot differently  than other people  do  yeah that's  what it is  Pat Tuffy's  the most emotional  of the interns  that's also why  he can't think  of stuff  with a snap  of a finger  because if you  say something  that hurts  his feelings 
[02:59:30]  instead of  just being  methodical  and thinking  of a comeback  his feelings  are hurt  so his  emotions  he's just  got all this  rage in him  that wants  to come out  so when I  start shitting  on him  the rage  comes out  and then he  can't do  anything about  it  because he  can't hit  anyone here  right  I think you  two ought to  shake hands  I say a hug  not a fag hug  finish this  whole thing  a little handshake  I'm thinking  a bare chested  hug  bare chested  yeah what  what  what's wrong  what's wrong  you guys  bare chested  wait a minute  bare chested 
[03:00:00]  okay  yeah what are you guys  a bunch of  homophobes  relax  little bare chested  hug  I'll squeeze  the life out of him  yeah I don't think  you can't hug him  too hard  I would probably  try to break his  spine  well that's why  I don't want to be  close to him  that's why you both  are bare chested  because then it's silly  Tony knows  just a handshake  I don't want to be  close to him  how about just a quick  handshake  handshake's fine  he gets his makeup  like men  what men do  let's see how close  but it's not  I am sorry  I didn't mean to  hold on  I'm not even going  for another reaction  I just want to  for my own benefit 
[03:00:30]  I want to see  you both start  the opposite sides  of the room  and I want to see  how close you can get  before Pat Duffy  can't get any closer  that's all I'm asking  for now  I'm not asking  for a strangulation  or any of that  and Master Pole  will be close  just in case  so everyone is safe  I'll be straight  out of fear  of Sam's safety  I don't want to be  close to him  right now  that's legit  like you don't know  if you'll just clock him  no because if I get  close to Sam  shoots me some  fucking dumb smile  I just  oh yeah  he probably would  that's fair  have you ever  fantasized about punching 
[03:01:00]  that's fair  yes  I would gleefully  break my hands  on Sam's face  I've thought about it  so many times  wow  really  oh my god  you had a lot of  Sam's in your life  growing up  where exactly  would you hit him  first  first  first punch  first thing I would do  I'd hit him right in the chest  so that he got stepped back  and he didn't know what to do  and when he leans forward  because of his chest  I would hit him twice in the face  like that  and then that would knock him down  I'd get him on the ground  I'd put my knees over his  over his shoulders  and I would literally punch  until my fist hit pavement  through his skull  wow 
[03:01:30]  I would fucking kill him  in a second  would you do an American History X  put his mouth on a curb  absolutely  bite the fucking curb  absolutely  wow  wow  actually a little tension between you  I thought about it  a little  might be a little problem  and now what would you do Sam  against Pat Duffy  well if me and Pat Duffy were to fight  I would probably get punched in the chest  and then I would lean my head forward  and get punched twice in the face  that's damn funny  and then I would end up dying 
[03:02:00]  no no no  no I wouldn't kill you  I would beat you to within an inch of your life  so for the rest of your life  the next time you would fuck with somebody  you thought about it  you thought about the consequences  wait wait wait  maybe you could put on  quartering by horses  number 13 on your bed  oh  oh boy  oh this is just ugly  oh no  that's wrong  that was bad  does this worry you  what he's saying  like did you know  that he had this level of animosity for you  yes I did  so why do you still fuck with him  why would you throw papers at his face 
[03:02:30]  I  thought that  we were just getting along  like I thought he was gonna be like  this time  you know  he's finally gonna see  I'm just playing with him  because  I wanna be his friend  like I thought maybe I just  wow that's a hell of a way  because like  I'd throw the papers at Tony  and he's like  oh Sam's throwing papers at me  we're just playing around  Sam's cheeks are awfully rosy today  what's that about  you can't help it  both races fighting to get out  wow  I don't like the way you all left me  hanging on that one  it hurts  you guys 
[03:03:00]  maybe they need to  watch a chick flick together  or something  you guys need to do something  to get this  this anger out  my ways of making friends  is not working  making  friends  Sam take a step toward  Pat Duffy  one step  yeah cause you guys  can't have any violence  towards each other  you gotta work together  you can't  you can't have that  tell me what you're feeling Pat  Sam is taking one step toward you  he's a good  15 to 20 feet away  I'd say 15 feet away  how you feeling right now  I feel  I'm still alright  I'm just waiting for him to do something  that's just gonna fuck with me  the whole time over here 
[03:03:30]  but so far okay  with him a little closer  yeah I'm alright  it's fine  Sam take one more step  one more step  alright now you're about  I don't know  12 feet away from  from Pat  if I freak out though  I can't just  I can't  because  I won't get hired  I can't just freak out  does he embarrass you a lot  that's what  that's what  yes  that's what we're getting at  you can't freak out  I know  this is a lesson  a life lesson  I'm in position to freak out  calm  deep breath  deep breath  deep breath  okay  breathe 
[03:04:00]  breathe  let's see you breathing  I'm fine  I'm breathing  alright Sam  take another step  alright one more step  I'm not doing anything  no paper balls  no nothing  Sam is  you do have paper balls  he's got his hands in his pocket  let it be known  that Sam's a little nervous  right now  alright  Sam's about 10 feet away  from Pat  because he's  just described  what he's gonna do to him  it wasn't good  he wants to kill him  or not kill him  but beat him  believe me  by the way  he'd be dead  I know  you'd be like  oh I didn't mean to kill him  I just meant to beat him  within an inch of his life  but then my ruler broke 
[03:04:30]  how's your fist  gonna get to the pavement  without passing through his brain  yeah  he needs that to live  Pat  thanks for picking that apart  sure  yeah  people are calling  people are calling Tony  the callback king today  by the way  the callback king  sitting in with us  oh yeah  Sam one more step  toward Pat  Pat  what do you feel  one more friendly step  he's within 10 feet of you now  how do you feel  I'm just  I'm imagining the next  10 minutes of my head  and I just  I don't think 
[03:05:00]  I don't think Sam's brave enough  to say anything crazy  he's just walking toward you  that's all that's going on  oh that's it Poe  kick the papers  that he was throwing at his head  I have nothing to lose  you have stuff to lose  you can go to jail  you can lose a job  you got plenty to lose  wow listen how he's threatening you  with legal fucking shit  oh Sam will be  immediately  yeah  yeah  yeah well I'm not going to punch you back  I'm weak  take the phone out of it  I'm weak  alright one more step  one more step Sam  let's see  just one more step 
[03:05:30]  the steps are getting smaller by Sam  it needs to be noted  yes  they were big strides  when this little  little game of chicken started  I was much further away before  Pat how you doing now  I'm fine  I don't like the security coming in as well  no I don't mind that  just in case  for your own safety  how many feet away are you there Pat  uh  I'd say like 8 feet  alright  Sam how about another step  alright I'm going one more step Pat  alright  we're good  oh that was a really small  that was a half  half a step  half a step  that was a 
[03:06:00]  that was a  yeah that was an ST  very good  Sam are you worried  yeah  what are you worried about  how many feet away are they  Yorok  face to face  how many feet  about  6 or 7 feet  for anyone that thinks  that you can't live without a brain  or apparently a footy bag  it was too far away  should we do another step Sam 
[03:06:30]  I don't know  I mean we kind of made the point  Sam what's your fear  if Poe weren't there  I would be a lot more nervous  and I saw Poe very ably  as you know he should  well Poe  take Pat out of the equation  you can stop Pat without hurting him I hope  alright one more  how about we try one more step  we're trying to get  a breakthrough here  because you guys got to work together  on some level  yeah  I would like a handshake  Sam how about another step  one more step  well that was almost a full step 
[03:07:00]  Sam how far away  would you say you are  from death  just out of his reach  yeah probably 4 feet  yeah just out of his reach  I'm thinking about maybe  taking a half step back  no  oh no  this is a lesson for Sam too  I'm thinking  oh Pat's moved his hands now  I don't know what to do  with my hands  wow you look me in an acting scene  yeah  actually put him around  Sam's throat  no you don't have to do that  he's just kidding around  do we have another step in us  I'm wondering Sam  well I'm so close  I mean I don't think 
[03:07:30]  well this is where it's gotta  you know Pat's gotta do  the right thing  Paul what are you doing  he's stepping  let's do one more step  okay we're going  one more step  oh my god  that was close  that was close enough  that was 4 inches  Sam  yeah but now  we're pretty much  within each other's reaches  you've been a wise ass  to this kid for a while  I mean the least you can do  is like be brave enough  to take a step toward him  how do you figure  cause we told Pat  he can't touch ya  yeah but you can tell people 
[03:08:00]  what are you feeling right now  Sam is very close to you  he's less than 4 feet away  from your face  I feel like  Sam's got that  fucking smile on his face  like he's had  I knew he was gonna have it  and I'm just  I'm straight faced  a million dollar smile  I  this is no bit  I think Sam is a little  scared right now  do you think you're scared of me  I swear  I just admitted  that you would kill me  I'm not gonna  I would never have  a physical confrontation  with you Pat  you don't think  Sam is scared of you Pat  no  oh my god  we need to find 
[03:08:30]  a psychologist  just start making  chicken noises Sam  but yeah  you have to understand Pat  on the street  on the sidewalk  I wouldn't  dare fuck with you  but there  there  here  there are levels  of protection  that protect me  from physical confrontation  so the only way  that you would fuck me  is if Poe was  standing in front of you  yes  what if Poe was  looking the other way  or was sick that day  if Poe was  if Poe was sick today  yeah  I wouldn't be standing  this close to Pat Duffy  say Pat  see  does that help you out  a little bit  but that's  why do you need Sam  to be afraid of you 
[03:09:00]  because like  almost like  that's like  because you feel like  you can't battle  with him verbally  so you need some  feeling of empowerment  like he has to know  like Sam should know  that I'm a man  and there are consequences  for him doing this  I want to get this  like it's a press conference  for a prize fight  let's get a little closer  that's comforting Poe  we got the shot  you know  Sam I think you got  another step in you  well if you want to do  the picture  we could just put it  on panorama  and kind of just stay  how about another step  there Sam  what do you think Pat 
[03:09:30]  should we go one more step  go for it Sam  this is  this is  I'm going up to Poe's shoe  there you go  watch his legs  okay  alright what's going on  over there Tony  they're really getting  really close  Poe's got one foot  in between them  I don't think Poe  needs to have a foot  in between them though  he's feeling his chest  Poe back up  a second  yeah Poe  I don't think  Pat you're not  going to charge him  for just  he's not going to  charge him  let's all back up  no no no no  why are you backing up  don't back up  he's not going to charge him  Pat how you feeling now  I'm alright 
[03:10:00]  I'm alright  so you don't always  have to like  solve things with like  fists and punching  and anger  that's why we're doing this  it like shows that  you know  you're a reasonable fella  this humongous  is a reasonable man  Jimmy should we go  for another step  um  well how far apart  are they  I can't really see  they're about 4 feet  I'll say 3 feet  3 feet  very carefully  so you don't scare Sam  put your arm  all the way out  oh  alright alright  we're good  we're good  alright  see Pat's showing 
[03:10:30]  a little humor Sam  Sam almost shit his pants  that was just  screw with him a little bit  Duffy did a big  huge step forward  right into Sam's face  yeah Opie said  arm out  and Pat Duffy said  body out  yes  and went the whole way  but Pat's showing  that look  I can play too  a little bit  he was having a little fun  right Pat  a little bit  a little bit  so Sam  what would you like  to say to Pat  for real  like not  you know  cause you know  you've been fucking  with him  and you see  it's been getting  to him  on a real level  like not a fun level  yes  Pat I have no  vested interest 
[03:11:00]  in hurting you  mentally  I couldn't hurt you  physically  alright  and that's  that's it  Sam now that  you're real close  to Pat  like explain  what your motive is  are you  is your motive  to drive  Pat Duffy insane  or just have  a little fun  or to push  buttons of someone  that  that hair  just drive you  crazy Pat  would you love  to just see  blood coming  out of it  and it would  it wouldn't even  get on the hair  it would just  pour out from  under it  yeah  cause it's an afro  so you'd just  see the afro  and then slowly  the blood would 
[03:11:30]  come down  the sides  of his head  is this on  Pal Talk  people are wondering  if this is  oh of course it is  how about  let's just see  how close we get  and then we just  count out like  10-20 seconds  and then this bit  will be over  okay  alright  Sam  turn your hat around  so you get  real close  alright  thanks Tony  alright Sam  how about your  shoes kind of  touch  as close as that  how about our  shoes touch  master pose shoe  no  Sam you know  what would be  really funny  if you threw  paper at his  face right now 
[03:12:00]  no  you remember  that Pat  like minutes ago  when he was  just throwing  paper at your  face  I blacked  most of it out  how annoying  that was  how about  we get really  close to end  the bit  we don't really  have a good  ending to the  bit yet  Sam  a little step  forward  I got an idea  alright a little  step  here we go  Pat you do  a little step  alright  see nothing  I think he's  okay  you can tell  I'm intimidated  of you  yes Pat  look at that  face  wait were you 
[03:12:30]  taunting him  with that  does that make  you feel good  no I'm making  sure we're all  good  no that made  it sound like  you were being  sarcastic  like you could  tell I'm  intimidated by  you  does that  make you  feel good  like big  man  that's not  what I'm  looking for  what are you  looking for  Pat  you guys are  less than two  feet apart  I never expected  it to get to  this point  I'm not looking  for anything  pull his heart  out  I would love  to  that'd be  great  what could  he do  call him  call him  call him  just like  pull his heart 
[03:13:00]  out  Indiana Jones  Temple of Doom  yeah  yeah  alright they're  not even really  looking at each  other  I can't  I bet you  could left  hand slap  him in the  face before  Poe could  even  no no I  could tell  because it  was slow  motion  you really  could have  gone a lot  faster  yeah  yeah  master Poe  was in  there  I am  master  the master  how about  this  how about  a handshake 
[03:13:30]  yeah a handshake  needs to be done  it's a game  are you  faster  than the  master  that's right  I think  Sam's  reaching out  his hand  will you do  that for me  Pat  will you  shake my  hand  in honor  oh  yeah  oh boy  I guess  that was a  no  oh boy  they're going  for it  so I'll  consider that  friends again  I take that  about you  yeah  wow  Pat why'd you  have to shake  his hand  like that  now I have  a problem  with you  I'm sorry  we'd set this  whole thing up 
[03:14:00]  nice for you  and you  grabbed his  hand and pulled  him toward you  so you could  destroy him  I'm sorry  a nice handshake  I'm sorry  this whole thing  for you  we can't  beat the guy  we can't have  you walking  around  we can have  you hate  each other  but we can't  be worried  that stupid  little Sam  is going to  get physically  beaten up  even though  it would be  fun to watch  I've been  walking around  wanting to  kill him  for a year  though  I know  but you have  to work  that out  let me tell  you what  happens  if we ever  hire you  we can't  have you  be violent  you kill  Sam  there's a  position on  the O.P. & Anthony  show  ta-da  Tony gets hired  that's right  just remember 
[03:14:30]  when you're  shaking his  hand  your new name  in the office  is going to  be newspaper  face for like  three weeks  Tony you're  flipping sides  on me  you don't  understand  what's going  on  just take one  for the team  Sam  Tony what was  that about  a nice  handshake  I need to  see this  give him a  nice shake  a nice shake  smile  good  get him  yeah there  it is  now Sam  tell him  about the  stink finger  you just  gave him  while shaking  his hand  there's no  stink  Paul would  you smell  my hand 
[03:15:00]  there's no  stink fingers  here  and E-Rock  is just  smiling like  a retard  because it's  not him  yeah Pat  don't you  understand  all the  abuse  everyone else  gets around  here  it gets  really ugly  no I know  and I fully  understand that  alright Pat  you gotta chill  man  I'm calm  I can't  freak out  I'm fine  do you talk  to anyone  about this  no  because this  is a real  thing  I've never  seen this  before  I know  I try not  to get  like this  but what's 
[03:15:30]  scary is  if we didn't  have this  on the air  today  people go  well you  provoked it  but that's  been going  on behind  the scenes  and we  didn't  know it  that may  have exploded  at a time  when fucking  Poe was  at court  or not here  and no one  was there  to stop it  that may  have exploded  where fucking  Danny had to  run in  and stop it  so it's like  now we're all  aware of it  because it's  on the air  that would be  a pain  that would be  awful  what a pain  in the ass  that would be  to break that  up  have to pick  Sam's dumb  teeth out of  the fucking rug  and lose Duffy  and that face  is made for TV  well you know 
[03:16:00]  then we'd have  to answer to  his mother  she'd be really  upset  no kidding  she'd have to  mash up fish  sticks and fucking  feed them to  like applesauce  yeah  very happy actually  Sam are you  going to continue  fucking with Pat  Duffy  or is this  kind of like  the  well we can  go ahead and  is this a turning  point  we can go ahead  and put a breather  on that for the  time being  let uh  let the hot  temperatures cool  down a little bit  before we start  doing any of the  jokes around the  office  wow I think 
[03:16:30]  Sam has learned  a little something  today too  just a little bit  I feel like we've  all learned something  about ourselves  I think so  yes yes  you alright Sam  oh I'm good  you're a brave  motherfucker man  he is  no he's not  we made him do it  no I'm not  with Poe standing  there  no I'm not  talking about  this I'm talking  about how he  just takes his  shots  oh that's cause  he's a smart ass  that never thinks  the consequences  I'm not even  I'm not even  kidding  you are the  biggest smart ass  around here  and you just  don't think of  the consequences  like some  animal like Duffy's 
[03:17:00]  just gonna pound  your face in  I will tell you  to Duffy's credit  my ribs may  bruise because of  the shots with  the remote control  the remote control  he wailed it  into you  yeah he really did  wow that had  to hurt  but even Duffy  you gotta give  even though you  don't like Sam  you gotta give him  credit for one  thing is that even  though he's scared  to death of getting  his teeth knocked  out he is Sam's a  funny dude  oh absolutely  and he did actually  in knowing that  your rage was there  he did kind of go  because he's not  challenging you as a  man like I'll kick 
[03:17:30]  you around  he went for the  fucking funny angle  knowing that there  was physical harm  that could come to  him that is the sign  of a fucking funny  guy I gotta say  that for Sam  yeah I won't take  anything away from  Sam I think he's  a really funny dude  but he just  I don't know  what a piece of  shit  yeah he's a  fucking asshole  I'll take them  both  yeah  but it's not even  Sam you're mad  he reminds you  of something  that's what  that's why you  gotta talk to  someone  who taunted you  everybody  when you were  why  what was it about  you when you were  a kid  you sound like  a normal guy  I don't know  you don't ask  to get fucked  with it just  happens 
[03:18:00]  would they beat  you up  yeah I would  beat up a bunch  of times when  I was a kid  just made fun of  fucking constantly  who taunted you  what would they  make fun of you for  what would they  make fun of  you're not a  make funable guy  well that's the  point he made  himself look like  he's not the  make funable guy  he used to be  he's got the  tats he's got  the crazy man  beard  you don't know  who's fucking  with him now  crazy man beard  think of him  without the beard  without the tats  do you work out  or something  no  all right  landscape  landscape  so you're getting  exercise  you know  imagine him a little  doughier  without the facial hair 
[03:18:30]  I was a little  over 300 pounds  at one point  oh okay  so you're a fat kid  hey get a lot  of fats over there  that's pretty much  what you got  his name's tony  what are you doing  I've been fat  since 8  I'm fine  yeah what the fuck  tony I gotta stick  up for you  I'm starting to like  you a lot more  that's a coincidence  you were fat  since 8  you were  ATE  of course  sometimes mine  take a couple  of minutes  you were 300 pounds  yeah  wow  really 
[03:19:00]  yeah  that was huge  in shape pounds  or  no  real out of shape pounds  just  yeah  what name hurt the most  that they would call you  mainly stupid  I don't like being called stupid  did your father call you stupid  a couple times  okay  now this is an honest question  I'm not kidding  were you stupid  I don't think so  oh okay  because there are some kids  that are just fucking stupid  yeah  no I don't think I'm stupid at all  no  I've seen you show us  your intelligence 
[03:19:30]  yeah  I think I'm  somewhat intelligent  you know who's stupid  Sam  is real fucking stupid  what do you mean  because you're fucking  you taunt a jackal  yeah  you just fucking  taunt animals  that can kill you  well it's like being at the zoo  and just hoping those bars  on the cage  don't take  yeah  you're the tiger fucking  guy with the slingshot  yeah  shooting the fucking tiger  dude you gotta  you gotta like size up  the person you're being  a smartass to  I was well aware  of the consequences  of my actions  the quicker you learn  that lesson 
[03:20:00]  the better you're gonna be  trust me  I was hoping I'd have  space to run  oh really  yeah  I knew that Pat Duffy  had it in him  and I'm well aware  that if I get him angry  enough  he will physically  annihilate me  you got a bruise yet  I don't know  ooh  that's for you  that's for pal talk  show it off  you got a bruise  I don't like Sam's hairy stomach  it actually shows  that he's a man  for real  that takes the whole  twink thing out  it really does  Robert Kelly's gonna be 
[03:20:30]  very disappointed  we'd have to nair you  he was hoping you'd have  a hairless body  just like nair all the hair  off you so you're a true twink  yeah I'll shave it  to save the gimmick  that's a gimmick  see there he goes again  oh that's Sam  yeah  Pat you alright  I'm okay  alright Pat's alright  I'm just going over my head  the things that I would have  changed about this already  just things I could have  done better  things I've thought of  now to say  like what  like what  I don't know  give us an example  you panic in those moments 
[03:21:00]  you gotta stop  you worry about  the results are none  of your business  as I was told  all you can do is  spit out what you got  and wherever the fuck  it lands it lands  don't worry about  how it's gonna look  or sound  just save it for the next guy  who misses something  in the trash can  that was  that whole attack  was Sam  I saw Sam in my head  wow  wow  the whole time  he's got a problem  with you  oh my god  that's the first thing  I said to him  when he came in the office  after we all knew  that I was like  you thought  you just pictured  my head on that  construction worker's body  didn't you  and he 
[03:21:30]  yes I did  picture your head  anywhere except  on your shoulders  yeah  pretty much  fuck  he sees an afro  it's over  therapy's going  very well today  eat up Martha  has a great idea  have each staff member  come in and give Pat  one piece of  constructive criticism  oh fuck  who wants to line up  and give him  constructive criticism  than will do it  alright  big tall than  this is constructive now  not  for real  for real  well there's a real 
[03:22:00]  obvious one  do you mean it has to do  with radio production  or just like life  like  mind your temper  hold on  words from Nana  Nana  the Nana and Sam show  oh  mind your temper  that's right  and then put on a sweater  it's chilly in here  settle down  I'm gonna watch my stories  yeah  mind your temper  fucking  anybody else wants 
[03:22:30]  to get in on the  constructive criticism  I see Danny at the door  Danny's making his way in  I was just watching the show  oh okay  anybody else brave enough  to do the  constructive criticism  I'll give him some  constructive criticism  I know that  Pat gets bogged down a lot  doing some other work  and I think that might  take away from  the time that he could be  trying to be creative  which Tony has a big  problem with  so maybe he should try  and take a few minutes  or maybe an hour  or just some piece of time  maybe not even here  maybe at home or something 
[03:23:00]  and try to come up  with something creative  if he wants to  not be known as  stunt boy all the time  I like that he's known  as stunt boy  well  and I don't mind either  because I think it's  great radio  but it's a problem  see 100 stunt boys  like ugh  but like  Pat Duffy's stunts  are impressive  to me that's not even  a bad thing to be  a stunt boy  I think a stunt boy  is a derogatory term  you do shit  that most people  won't fucking do  which is amazing  and I enjoy it  you know  there's a cringe style  to your fucking  performance  which is necessary  he brushed his teeth 
[03:23:30]  with dog shit  but if he doesn't  want to be known  as the kid  that brushed his teeth  with dog shit  you know  try and come up  with another angle  I'm not saying  that you have to  stop doing the stunts  keep doing them  they're great  but at the same time  if it's gonna bother you  to be known as the kid  that eats dog shit  I never said that though  that doesn't bother me  just the whole thing  with Tony saying  that's all that I do  that was my whole argument  because  yeah obviously on air  one of the only things  I do is stunts  and stuff on the air  but behind the scenes  I do a bunch of stuff  yes  all right  very good  I guess that's it  hey this is intern 
[03:24:00]  Pat Duffy  and you're listening  to me desperately  seek attention  on the worst  of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  it's the worst  it's so good  of Opie and Anthony  it's the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show  slide a finger  into me bum  hey  how was Japan  uh  Ronifaz Nuna 3  it was great  oh nice one  yeah  you could come over here  we don't  we don't bite  whose hat is that  Peter Cushing  from Star Wars  oh my god  that is a Star Wars hat  you can drop that mic 
[03:24:30]  in the chair  did you uh  looks good  she's afraid  to come over here  oh I can sit there  is anybody gonna  try to shave my head  no no  not through that hat  okay  that is so funny  it is definitely  Peter Cushing's hat  from Star Wars  did you sample  any Asian penis  no  I did not  she's a size queen  she wouldn't like that  yeah  some Japanese guy  tried to fuck her  she said  tape six of those together  possibly  she's got a Japanese hat on 
[03:25:00]  I do  it makes you look like  a little anime character  well that's good I guess  yeah  what was the best thing  you did in Japan  um  the food was excellent  Chinese food  no I mean  Japanese food  Japanese food  did they have sushi  with wasabi  um  I went to  Mount Fuji  yeah  but it was  monsooning that day  I went to that place once  it was uh  what was that on  Jericho Turnpike  yeah I think so  yeah  great food  oh no the real  oh you mean the mountain 
[03:25:30]  yeah  holy shit  I thought you were talking  about the jeb joint  that used to eat at  no no no  the real mountain  oh how'd that look  I don't know  it was monsooning  and it was cloudy  monsooning  yeah  it was monsooning  is that the right tense  I guess  it was raining heavy  yes  oh okay  can't you just say  heavy rain  well I thought  monsooning was better  yeah it sounds very  um  Japanese  you got an attitude  ever since you got back  from Japan  because they probably  looked up at you  they were probably  freaking out at you  right  because you're tall 
[03:26:00]  they're actually  not as short as I thought  yes they are  no really  they hide in tunnels  they really weren't  I think Chinese  may be shorter  well Chinese are shorter  yeah you're right  Japanese might not  but very clean city  is it  embarrassing to come back  to New York  wow really  really really embarrassing  that's a big deal  they fucking  of course it's a clean city  they all shit in each other's mouths  fucking throw their garbage  on girls in wedding dresses  there's no fucking  where would the dirt go  they use their fucking women  to clean the streets  with their tongues  fucking rotten  world war 2 losers  that's what you get 
[03:26:30]  for fucking starting shit  do they look like  start fresh  with a fucking  nice brand new slate  clean slate  do they all look like  Mr. Potato Head people  they all have the same faces  but their accessories  make them look different  yeah they all do look alike  long hair  short hair  different color hair  I think they would think  the same thing about us  right  well all the girls have bangs  like straight hair with bangs  so they all look  flat asses  and they're all  dressed the same  like black suits 
[03:27:00]  the men all wear suits  really  and the women all wear like  you know  suit  kimonos  with the backs  cut out of the pants  so they can be raped  on the subway  lovely culture  yeah the women  have to wear something  so the men can sneak up  behind them  and pull their skirts up  and rip their underwear off  in some pseudo filmed rape  no I did not  we were watching videos  online the last couple weeks ago  yeah they do that  in Japan  in Japan  the hand can be used  like a knife  but it doesn't work  on this tomato  I don't understand  I got it  anyone 
[03:27:30]  thank you  see there's your hat  that isn't Peter Cushing  but  that's your hat  yes  I think it looks better on me  but  of course it does  Lord Vader  just saying  did you have any  you gotta get some throat lozenges  to put on your chest  as medals  for some reason  they're multicolored  throat lozenges  a lozenge  did you get any Japanese  splooge on your back  while you're trying  to take a subway ride  because they do that too  we hear  they do that too  I didn't see any of this  did you get shoved into a subway  like by a stick  because that's what they do too 
[03:28:00]  they pack them in like sardines  and the men molest the women  and they got  women only trains right  I didn't see that  I don't know  I was in Tokyo  so maybe it's more modern  than the rest of Japan  this is the beauty  of what's going on here  because when people  come to the United States  for the first time  they think we're all  just cowboys  they go back  with their rumors  did you see people  on horses  what  did you see people  shooting other people  because I hear that  happens all the time  in America  I saw footage  where they take sticks 
[03:28:30]  to push people  into subway trains  and shove as many people  as possible in there  and then the guys  splooge on the backs  of women  they jerk off  on women's backs  it's a major problem  there to the point  they started doing  women only subway trains  that's a true story  that's how you know  you're in  to keep the pervs away  you with nice people  and a good culture  when they fucking  can't even travel to work  without sexually  assaulting women  they talk about  fucking our civilization  being shit  fucking just awful  glad you made it back  we kaplooied them 
[03:29:00]  you sure did  we gave them  a couple of kaplooies  here comes one bomb  called the old  fresh start  did you go to  like a massage parlor  I got a massage  in my hotel room  shiatsu  karate chop  I don't know  what that is  shiatsu  you had very deep tissue  yeah  and was it a guy  no it was a woman  it was a woman  strong Asian hands  yeah  did she full release  no  sorry  did she dill you  until you squirted 
[03:29:30]  across the room  how far down  your back did she go  did she do your ass  the top of my ass  really  pretty far up  like the back  of my thigh  really  yeah  they usually  always do that  you do that  I don't know  I don't go for massages  did you ever have this  where they push on the back  really hard  you just shit  I wonder what that would do  to a massage therapist  if they just push real hard  a log or a geyser  either or  throw them a curveball  once in a while  just when they get ready 
[03:30:00]  for logs  you fucking fire  an old yellowstone  at them  did you have water  shot up your ass  to clean out your ass  yes  this is the most amazing thing  they have bidets  on the toilets  yeah  and the little thing  comes out  and it shoots up  and it cleans your  area  did you get off  no I didn't get off  a little drying thing  there's no reason  for this  oh gee  and then  you got Lily's  little naked picture  up there  it's not naked  well it's  it's almost naked  there's no need for it  Than  that's uh  that's you  that's a good picture 
[03:30:30]  what's the problem  Than saw that  well  half maybe  Than did you see boobies  he saw that  without the panties  you saw boobies  I don't know about that  really  is Than a foot freak  he's probably just  looking at the toes  there's a reason  she's got good feet  I do have nice feet  I'll say the video  is very sexy  you're not complimenting  her picture  by saying she has  nice feet  I know  no no  it's like the whole  the whole packet  I'm talking about  why don't you start  with like the face  or something else  before you go  wow you got  really nice feet  it's the obvious  which are way  in the background 
[03:31:00]  by the way  she knows she has  a pretty face  she's very self  conscious about her feet  Lily hates her feet  we've talked  yes  because her feet  have open sores  on the bottom  no that's not true  like tree man's feet  she has little spiders  on her feet  so tell us more  about the water  shooting up your asshole  it was really enjoyable  really  and then heated toilet seats  and then they open  it open and closes automatically  so you don't even touch nothing  no  you don't even need toilet paper  did you check  did you check  just to make sure  they did the job  this machine did its job 
[03:31:30]  no I didn't need to  I'd be checking  you absolutely didn't even need anything  it washes you like a car wash  exactly  for your asshole  exactly  what is this video  we're watching  I mean seriously  that's the video  what is this  what is this  didn't you talk about this  last time  and we didn't have the photos yet  I've been in Japan  is this the video  of you doing your photo shoot  yeah it is  ah  what else about Japan  sushi's fresh  sushi's fresh  the people are very nice  nobody jizzed on me  you go to a sex  like club 
[03:32:00]  no  why not  no I didn't go to the  whatever the red district  where they shoot  ping pong balls out  of their vaginas  yeah  I think they could also  put a pin  or dart in a straw  put the straw  in their vagina  and pop a balloon  with it  they could like  contract  and the dart  shoots out  we're almost  at the point  where Lily  disrobes  disrobes  seriously  there's no reason  for this  well no  there's no reason  but there's no reason 
[03:32:30]  for that  what happened  all of a sudden  it was the video  we were watching  before with the goat  ooh  look at that  taking your best  Lily  what's wrong Lily  I don't know  I just feel  was Earl interested  at all  no he's asexual  ugh  so not even gay  just now we're  going with asexual  no yeah  he's absolutely  no sex drug  look at how  now how did you feel  in front of Earl  dropping that robe  and being 
[03:33:00]  it was like  undressing in front  of my girlfriend  really  it's just  so not  wow you show  him right there  you kind of  did you show  him uh  you showed him  boobs  yeah  and Earl  didn't um  pop wood  or nothing  did Earl pose you  or did you just  come up with  the poses yourself  Earl didn't even  speak  he's so beyond  look at him  just staring  he probably would  have like  come  if he just  talked  hello  could  could you  hello  Lily looks very  good on camera  too 
[03:33:30]  thanks  no very nice  in the video  oh look  you're covering  your bosoms  with a hat  with the little  Frank Sinatra hat  there's a hat  on your bosoms  you get naked  now  we'll pull out  our cameras  no I have my  period  nobody wants  heavy  heavy fluff  never a problem  get on a giant  bingo board  and play  I don't care  nothing  alright  I thought that  was something  it was  thanks fan  I think  I didn't get  enough ears  I couldn't  agree more  I don't care  if the bed  looks like  a scene  out of seven  oh look  a Japanese  flag 
[03:34:00]  redeems himself  oh swim  walk  Jimmy  that's a  swim  swim  walk  we got  Billy Mitchell  audio  we'll have  to wait  for tomorrow  for this  yeah  so where'd  you stay  in Japan  would you  stay in  a nice hotel  or kind of  like a  no it was  a nice hotel  I hear they  just put you  in drawers  like there's  little hotels  I had a little  corner suite  so I was  very happy  when did you  realize it was  a waste of  time to fly  all the way  to Japan  I didn't 
[03:34:30]  realize that  I enjoyed it  very very much  though  and uh  you see monkeys  how was it  monkeys no  monkeys  they have monkeys  roaming around  some of the villages  more like more  south Japan  they do  but I stayed  in Tokyo  my question  wrong country  um  so you uh  were you able to  we talked before  Lily left  about plugging your  laptop in  were you able to  at least do that  on your flights  no  fucking continental  you need like a  crazy adapter  or something  it's called like  an EM adapter  yeah I told you  that  oh you did not  yeah you did 
[03:35:00]  you didn't tell me  for the plane  yeah  why would you  need that  continental  probably keeps it  from burning up  or something  they fly 777  nonstop to Tokyo  how long is the  flight  uh 14 hours  going  oh good god  12 and a half  coming back  good  wow  14 hours  14 hours  it's almost worth  it going the  other way  it's like  wait if there's  24 hours  11 hours  you're damn right  why don't you  go the other way  or just go  or just hover  for 14 hours  go through the  earth  hover for 14 hours  and then bring  the vehicle back 
[03:35:30]  down to earth  and you'll be  going at 25,000  miles an hour  because that's  how fast the  earth rotates  exactly  why did you do  that  about  I'm not a  pilot  no a thousand  miles an hour  what  I'm sorry  a thousand  miles an hour  is it  what goes  a thousand  that's why  one rotation  is one day  the earth  rotates  at  what speed  the earth  rotates  at  what speed  so 14  let me ask you a question  this is an odd question  but 14 hours  on the plane  how many plane dumps  yeah that's a good question  I think I had one 
[03:36:00]  it's not bad  for 14 hours  I didn't really eat a lot  on the plane  so  what do you do  for 14 hours  slept  off the sleeping pill  yeah that makes sense  did you like masturbate  for the hell of it  Dr. Cuckold  Dr. Cuckold  how many  you can masturbate  on a plane  I couldn't  what  why  I just couldn't  keep a rod  under that awful  blanket  the flea infested  blanket  yeah  the person before  well you need  what you need  is a sleeper seats  you need the sleeper seats  then you tip them back  well I'm not a millionaire  so I wasn't  saying it for class  you want to go out with one 
[03:36:30]  you could have  used your dad's miles  that was a no  by the way  she's shy  she doesn't want to  answer in the air  that's okay  it's not a no  she's just a little  Lily's very shy  yeah sorry  no not really  I just you know  I have a boyfriend  you know  yeah no I know  oh that's an easy  that's such an easy way  to get out of something  we touched on that  like fucking months ago  when you were supposed  to stay at my house  when the bet got lost  I did  I knew the whole situation  what you stayed at my house  yeah  it must have been  the night I was  in fucking Atlantic City 
[03:37:00]  and all the shit  was being moved out  well that was when  I was  maybe that's when  you were there  did you help move  any furniture  what would it take  for you to go  sleep with Anthony  what  what  just asking  we're just friends  are you trying to  pimp me out  we're friends  I'm just asking  what would it take  to sleep with Anthony  like dollar wise  massive amounts  of drugs and alcohol  oh yeah  right  he's got that covered  good I could buy that  right  keep going  I won't even take  that as an insult 
[03:37:30]  I take it as  something to do  instead of saying  fuck you  you're like  alright what pills  slowly  yeah what do you need  and spell them  write them down  massive amounts  I think maybe  if I didn't have  a boyfriend  like maybe I would  you know  think about it  what if you guys  were in a  like I am legend  situation  yeah absolutely  alright good  alright so  I gotta hope  for the apocalypse  that's good  that's good  Jesus Christ  you fucked fan  for fuck's sake  I didn't fuck  fan  well you went 
[03:38:00]  out with him  right  yeah  I thought you  guys had sex  I thought you  guys had sexual  intercourse  that may reflect  poorly on  fan the way  you said that  yeah I wanted  to get back  to that  I was trying  to throw him  under a bus  to take the  weight off me  it's almost like  I have to get  her drugs and  alcohol  it's like how  could you not  like me  with no disrespect  when this piece  of shit  exactly  that's true  though  you're right  oh piece of  shit  yeah  wow  at least a six  but that's  alright  100 Tylenol  PMs  going back  to earlier  in the show 
[03:38:30]  will that do it  would that do it  100 Tylenol  PMs  yeah but then I  wouldn't even be  coherent  or like  I wouldn't  pass out  what  this is a bad  day to say  Lily flaps  gums  yeah  oh fuck  I mean  that's not  funny  that's really  mean isn't it  butch  flaps gums  I really think  that was Danny  because Danny  doesn't really  like me  really  why doesn't Danny  like you  why doesn't Danny  don't like you  he doesn't like  women  he's you know  Danny 
[03:39:00]  you don't like  Lily  oh shit  oh shit  must remind him  of his mother  yes  why don't you  remind me of  mother  what's wrong  with Lily  what's the matter  with Lily  I don't know  Lily's just a little  I think she's  she feels like  she's a little  entitled  around here  I don't know  she doesn't even  get paid  I know what  this is about  yeah exactly  she doesn't even  get paid  I know what  this is about  me asking  why Danny  was hiding  water in the  office  and apparently  I was  well it's not 
[03:39:30]  me that's  hiding water  it's just  no it was you  you said  I hid the water  because somebody  from Ronin  says he's  stealing it  yes  oh really  there's a water  problem  are we talking  about regular  water  what the fuck  is the problem  seriously  she's not  fucking  in the middle  of Sahara  we'll go to  the deli  and buy a  six pack  war solved  well see  the problem  is  Miss Lily  who's barely  on the map  as an intern  decides that  she's gonna  come in  and start  yeah  barely on the map 
[03:40:00]  yeah that's right  okay  go ahead  oh boy  okay that's what  I thought  so  oh shit  so she comes in  and she starts  like demanding  things of our  interns  no no no  demanding nothing  demanding nothing  I said  this is what I said  and I can maybe  understand why  he got upset  I said  why is water  being hidden  so I can understand  why he flipped out  yeah and then  and then you said  and I  and you tell me  who told you  to put that water  there  you tell me  that  that's exactly  what you said  no I did not 
[03:40:30]  say that  now you're just  lying  no I'm not  just lying  bitch you're lying  you're lying  I heard what you said  and you were lying  now you're lying  to try to save face  I heard what you said  I caught you  because you didn't know  that I was in the room  right next to where  you were yelling  at Ron  I would say it  in front of you  why were you hiding water  I'm not afraid of you  and then you said  well then  well I want to know  who told you to do that  and then she goes like this  well then you know what  you guys can't use our fridge  well yeah I think that's fair  and I was like  excuse me  get the fuck out of here  with you  I so have this figured out 
[03:41:00]  what  why don't I so have this figured out  okay what  when did she turn you down  never  never  never  I do remember  I don't glorify  sexes  oh shit  oh  I do remember  an instance  maybe in two events  we all took a look  and I'm sure  a bunch of people  around here  took their shot  there was maybe  a couple times  where Danny said  hey do you want to  you know maybe  make out or something  now she's just lying  no I'm not just  fucking lying  you said that to me  like three times  that is a 
[03:41:30]  that is a blatant lie  why would you make out  with Danny  at least I got  massive amounts  of drugs and alcohol  I don't think  you have a shot  and I'm not stupid  enough to ask  what's the hello  all about  I've seen Danny  does quite well  for himself  yeah I mean  just not with me  I don't  you know  I'm not attracted  I never went  I never went  for you  why aren't you  attracted to Danny  Jesus Christ  you can bring  the fucking clown  in now  hey everyone

[03:44:30]  fuck twat the clown  should meet the same fate  as vulgar the clown  it's a very good reference  I don't know  ass raped  ass raped  see yes  wow  uh what  what happened  what  which one is vulgar the clown  there  nevermind  I got confused  okay  well uh  yeah there still seems  to be this issue  uh with um  Danny and Lily  and Lily  uh a little argument  over water  it kind of escalated  into this  uh what I see  as hatred  oh and then  he's  cause he's so mature 
[03:45:00]  so he stole my ID  to get into the building  and he won't give it  back to me  yeah you did  no I didn't  yeah you did  wow there's uh  sexual tension  in this room today  hardly  hardly  oh  Jesus  why don't you just  you guys should just  have sex  and get it over with  man  no  it's obvious  there's a little  tension here  no I just don't like  the way she walks  around here sometimes  like you know  if you wanna  is it a shit don't  stink kind of thing  yeah a little bit  is that what you're  gonna  I mean I don't  I don't really have  so much  you shouldn't talk about  that though  I don't really have  last time I checked  well hey bitch  I get fucking paid here 
[03:45:30]  you walk around  for fucking free  you show up  when you want  you barely do  anything around here  so I don't want  you talking to  my fucking staff  then I shouldn't have to  follow rules right  so then you shouldn't  talk to my staff  like you fucking  like you're the  fucking  like you're the  building manager  wait when did  Danny get a staff  why my boss's  Ron and Feds  didn't have  fucking water to drink  that's why I was  pissed off  so you're basically  saying that Ron and  Feds are less important  excuse me  there's ways to go  about this way  no I'm not saying  that at all  I'm saying that  there are ways to  go about handling  situations that don't  involve being a  massive cunt  so do you remember  who it was  whoa  cunt word doesn't  bother me at all  but do you remember 
[03:46:00]  which intern it is  that I spoke to  because I can't remember  sure it was Ron  it was Ron  he's not here today  unfortunately  I hardly doubt  that he would think  okay well don't worry  next time he comes in  we can hammer it all out  okay that's great  we'll do that  over water  we can do that  no it's over you  being a fucking cunt  and acting inappropriately  no because when my  fucking bosses come in  here at 11.59  and don't have  fucking fresh water  to drink  I get it  okay then  and you know why  we have to hide water  because I don't know  what goes on  on the other show  but there's a lot of  water that goes missing  so we take some water 
[03:46:30]  and we kind of  move it off to the side  that way we have a stash  so when Jim or Oprah  anybody needs water  we have guests that come in  we have a stash  I get it  well I guess we're gonna  have to order some more water  well that's a good idea  order  let's order more water  the point is  I would never  I would never expect  one of my guys  ever  ever  when we need water  to start screaming  at Earl or Dave  I didn't scream at anybody  I didn't fucking scream at anybody  then talking loudly  the way that you did  saying  well then you know what  you can't use my fridge 
[03:47:00]  that wouldn't ever happen  there would never be  there would never be  shut the fuck up  there would never be  any disrespect like that  shown from this staff  so you're talking about respect  he goes  shut the fuck up  there would never be  any disrespect  well this is on the air  this is how I handle things now  behind in that  in that kind of a situation  because this has already  escalated to this point  I mean we already had  our screaming match  so  but the way that  the way that  I would have handled that  in your position  which is not one of power  is to ask nicely 
[03:47:30]  hey is there any water around  and not to fucking threaten  I want to know  who said you should  be hiding water  you can't use our fridge then  who are you  you're really escalating  no I'm not  I'm telling you exactly  how it went down  because I didn't say it like that  I didn't say it like that  so you're calling me a liar  yeah basically I am  or an exaggerator of the truth  I'm not  I think that's fair  I really wish Ron  I think that's fair  maybe we can get Ron on the phone  Ron wasn't there  I don't know  he was there  because he was the one  that you were talking to  line one if we'd like to talk to him  to get to the bottom of the water issue  what happened? 
[03:48:00]  oh Ron the intern?  oh hip hop Ron  is on the phone  let's hear from Ron  Ron wasn't it you  that Lily was demanding to know  who hid water?  yeah it was me  and it wasn't for Ron  it was for her  it was not for me  it doesn't matter really  who it was for  the point is  whose representation  of what had happened  is more truthful  or closer to reality  you're absolutely right  it wasn't you  it was her  she was demanding it  what did she say?  alright I get it  when's the water? 
[03:48:30]  I want water  like stuff like that  this is over water  this is  hip hop really paints a picture  yeah I know  hip hop's  you're great on the air  hip hop  the water's always stolen  when we have cases of water  so we have to hide it  how could the water be stolen  if it's for both shows?  well not really  I could understand  not really  Ron and Fez are like  the stepchildren of 202  yeah  I think we all know that  it's not about  it's not about the way  it's just  it's not about the way  it's just the way  that she went about  trying to just get  a simple task accomplished  and she had to run around 
[03:49:00]  you know  demand  where is the  I want this  well then you can't  it was more about  how she acted  in that situation  than the actual situation itself  it just kind of summed you up  as a person  yes because I asked the question  why  no you didn't ask  you demanded to know  no no no no  I said why  you said I want to know  who told you to do that  no I didn't say  I want to know  excuse me but I'm sorry  but you're not  I didn't even fucking say it like that  yes you did  yes you did  and I would never  Ronnie shut up  that's why you asked me  if you can go buy me lunch 
[03:49:30]  every day  shut up  Ron is that a fact  hold on  let me get him back on  oh  hey Ron  yeah  do you ask  Lily if you could get her  lunch every day  I asked her  no it was once  because when I get  Sam's lunch  she told me  don't tell Sam  and go get me lunch  when next time you go get lunch  come in  it would be nice  see what I'm saying  because you know  she's smart  because I can't leave  at 11.30 
[03:50:00]  to go grab something  and I can't make it  three hours without eating  I'm sorry I can't  so if somebody's leaving  I say here  so why don't you just eat  before the show  because I can't eat breakfast  in the fucking morning  that would be crazy  10.45 is the morning  yeah  it's that early  I don't wake up  at 4 o'clock in the morning  so yeah  wake up 20 minutes earlier  and get your own  fucking slice of pizza  I can't eat  that early  wow  that's a lot of sexual tension  with a lot of different memories  I don't think this is sexual  I think this is just hatred  yeah  but where does this hatred come from 
[03:50:30]  I don't know  Danny definitely doesn't like  Lily's attitude  no women  Danny doesn't like  Lily's attitude  around here  feels that she walks around  but she doesn't even get paid  entitled  and she doesn't like  Danny  for not liking her  I would just  like if I  it's because I'm a woman  if it was a fucking guy  who said that  that's so not true  it'd be like okay  yes you're right  here's some water  but I'm a girl  I was just appalled  that that's how you felt  I was appalled  that you felt  that that was an appropriate way  can you just shut up 
[03:51:00]  no I can't  instead of talking over me  I'm trying to say  that I felt that  it was in that situation  there was no way  to go about that  there was an easy way  to do it  the right way to do it  and then the way  that you handled it  and I would never  imagine if Ron  who is actually an intern here  imagine if he went up  to one of your guys  Ron Bennington is an intern here  no Ron  he does a great show  he'd be like  a fucking intern of the year  right there  radio genius  amazing  but can you imagine  if my intern Ron  went up to one of your guys  Dave or Earl  or Pitsy 
[03:51:30]  and said  I want to know  who told you  to do that  and you know what  you can't use  the front fridge  how do you like that  then I'd say fine  no it would be  completely unacceptable  and you throw a little  cunty fit like you are now  listen we got Jay Moore  on the phone please  Jay help us out here  it's getting ugly in here  guys  you gotta chill out  this is how sticks broke up  that's smart  Dennis the Young  and Tommy Shaw  got in a huge water argument  and then Domo Arigato  was like number one 
[03:52:00]  Tommy Shaw hated it  and they fucking split up  you guys got  it's fucking water  you follow a fuck twat the clown  with a water argument  fuck twat the clown  the only way this show  could be saved  is if in the background  right now  I heard a fucking gunshot  and Dave hitting the ground  yeah  Lily take off your top  don't be a bitch  yeah Lily  just make everything okay  just get naked  no  who gave you lobsters  who gave you lobsters 
[03:52:30]  oh you did Jay  thank you  they were delicious  wow  I don't know  I don't want to see it  more sexual tension  I see  I don't play in the casino anymore  but you can take it off  from my friends  I drive right past  the casino these days  boys  I mean Danny  can we agree  that her Japanese hat  is cute  no  his Kangol hat  is much cuter  look you guys  gotta make up  I gotta hide  a terrible head  and balding  to deal with 
[03:53:00]  I have a reason  that I need to wear a hat  on a daily basis  you have nice hair  that you can do  and crimp  can I tell you guys something  crimp  you can do  and crimp  Jay's got the floor  Jay  you guys are both  fucking fags  yeah  I never thought  a girl could be  a fucking fag before  but the two of you  in this case  are like  if you're both  like my friends  you're both  fucking fags  and you gotta get  out of my car  and if you guys  don't make good here  you know  Ron and Fez  are gonna have to  wait in the mail room 
[03:53:30]  until we walk by  and then they can  come in and do their show  we don't want that  bleep bleep bleep  thank you  the band gets water  that's right  linger longer  don't make a  fucking maniac  out of me  I will slice  like a fucking hammer  alright I love you guys  but these two  you guys are fucking fags  Lily take off your tops  from my friends  I wear a lot of layers  it'll take a long time  thank you Jay  she literally does dress  like a homeless woman  look out of you  dumb fucking shit  whoa sorry  that was the old  that was the old me 
[03:54:00]  sorry sorry  yeah yeah  calm down Jay  you don't play  in the casino anymore  remember  I know  was make sure  everyone gets enough  and you catch more  flies with honey  than you do with vinegar  now I sound like  stalker patty  yeah  you catch more flies  than you do with  yeah  you catch even more  with shit  I don't care  how much water  you guys got  over the pump  to three  open it  and you need  your own water  what the fuck 
[03:54:30]  is Jimmy Norton  what is he  a goddamn  silent partner  I'm just watching  this fucking  unfold  it's awesome  yeah  hey I wonder  what Colin Quinn  thinks of the water  situation  I don't know  you know  I'll tell you one thing  you know one night  wearing a kangle hat  and he thinks he's me  going back to Brooklyn  I don't think so  okay  the lovely Lily  nobody really knows  what race she is  she's got like  an Armenian restaurant  with an Italian father  and a Mexican mother  who knows  she's a kind of girl 
[03:55:00]  she's everything  you throw that  paperwork  on her ethnicity  she has to check  all of them  but I'll tell you  one thing  I can look at that  Lily  I know she's got  brown labia  and I like that  there you go  it's Jay Brown  the incomparable  Jay Moore  remember  he drives by  the casino now  yeah  that is a fucking  funny line  he's fucking funny  alright Lily  show us your tits  and then get ready  for Ron and Fez  that's how  what  I'll get ready 
[03:55:30]  for Ron and Fez  but I'm not showing  my tatas  I'm in agreement  with you  she's very difficult  I saw them on film  and they light up  so you can't really  see them  they might blind you  it's like looking  into the sun  they'll burn your retinas  yeah  yeah Thanos  yeah I agree  silly argument  did it take massive  amounts of drugs  and alcohol  with Ann  lots of alcohol  yeah  oh okay  a fair amount  of boxed wine  from a Chinese restaurant  because I'm classic  can I see that hat  I want to see  what I would look like  in the hat  I remember the first  time I met you 
[03:56:00]  Lily  you were hammered  yeah I was  and it was at a party  and you sat down  and just started  going off  on an ex  oh yeah  how much was it  it was like  60  65 dollars  how many  how much yen  is that  hundreds of thousands  it's like 1 billion yen  6500  how do you carry money  around in that crazy country  a lot of coins  a lot of coins  everyone's jingling  around everywhere  alright we gotta do  the Japanese people  and their silly money 
[03:56:30]  remember when we said  we were gonna get out  of here early  yeah what happened  what happened  we fucked that up  water fight  you know  yeah  alright well you two  are gonna have to  agree to disagree  or you can agree  that you're both  assholes  to each other  I agree it's a stupid fight  but  it is but  and that's not the point  the point is  we don't have to  interact with each other  we you know  so there's no interaction  until you know  one decides to go  the other way  or until you decide  to give me back my ID  then maybe we can  you know work on the truth  Danny you do realize  she's beautiful right  yeah you called her a 6  that kind of was telling 
[03:57:00]  she's like I'll  believe you I'll  trash your chicken  but she's not  she's about a 7  girls can be prettier  or uglier to you  depending on how  you feel about them  yes  so now if Danny  despises her  for some reason  she's not gonna be  as attractive to Danny  as you know  maybe not on a level  where he connects with her  like he might still  hate her guts  but I've seen women  that were really hot  that I was like  ugh I hope she dies  in a fire  but she's an 8 and a half  I mean she's not  you know  I'm not gonna say  that she's  what makes her a 6  she's just  she's an average girl  what makes her average  she's an average girl  I don't see average 
[03:57:30]  she's not ugly  she's not ugly  by any means  but she's not like  oh my god  look at that  like you're not about  to twist your neck  to look at her  when she passes by  the personality takes away  from her hotness  it does a little bit  but I'll just judge  this strictly on  strictly on a physical  you get a lot of looks  when you walk around  um  guys turn their head  yeah a few  you know  she doesn't really  she doesn't really  have any assets  as far as  so I have a fucking  size B cop  what do you want to do  that's what I was giving  well I'm just saying  I get it  remember when I said  you were average  that's part of it too  see  well you know what 
[03:58:00]  I can't change that  I know you can't  but you know  you got a flat ass  I'm a white girl  you got a little boy body  what do you want me to tell you  what do you want me to tell you  she has long legs  I sit here and kiss your ass  and tell you how gorgeous you are  no I'm not saying that at all  but she has long legs  I think you're beautiful  I gotta be honest  and I'm not siding with anybody  in the fight  but I have to  I gotta be honest  and Lily and I  are never gonna fuck  just  she's smoking hot  I'm not even  being polite to her  but  it's for real  it's the truth  and I'm not saying that  to get in her pants  it's you know 
[03:58:30]  well you know  cheap boxed white wine  let's see your ass  no  no  I just  I'm gonna see  I don't think it's flat  Jimmy  oh you mean  in jeans  yeah  I thought you meant  pull my pants down  alright  it's a little bit  it's a white girl  I can't see it  it's not  no it's getting nice  it's not nearly enough  nice legs  for you maybe  but my boyfriend enjoys it  oh no  Thane is now helping daddy out  this can't be good  oh no  are you conspiring  no it's just a joke  because I  I noticed 
[03:59:00]  on our  one and only date  I noticed something about Lily  that no one's ever noticed  a bad smell  and now  and now it's all  I'm ever going to  so thank you  oh no  I know what it is  does it embarrass you  you can say it  no you can say it  I know what it is  she's got uneven nostrils  I do  I do  let me see  holy shit  I'll show you my  bad thought  I may have broken my nose  and that thing goes to  see it  wow  let me see it  you broke your nose  and you didn't know it  go this way  Thane what were you doing 
[03:59:30]  that you had a perfect angle  to see that  I don't know  maybe she threw back  a beer  as I was trying to  funnel alcohol  down her  how bad do you have to  want to shit on a chick  physically  when you go to the  fucking underside  of the nose  she's doing okay  if that's the first place  the eyes are good  the face is good  but the underside  of the nose  is shit  she actually had to  throw her head back  so we could see  a slight flaw  I'm not saying  it brings  I would say  it doesn't bring her  down a tenth of a point 
[04:00:00]  unless you're doing coke  with her  who gives a shit  it's just something  I noticed  there's a bit of blockage  on that one nostril  just something I noticed  and then it's silly  that I noticed that  what else did you notice  about her  just great person  okay  you're gonna turn this around  you're gonna turn this around  keep your chin up  I tend to react  and I'm not saying  Danny and I  are very dissimilar at all  because I tend to react  like I get along well with Lily  but if I didn't get along well with her  I would probably be like  Danny 
[04:00:30]  because I tend to react  much harsher  to fucking hot chicks  not out of a threat  or anything like that  but I just  because  when I see a beautiful girl  I always think  they're fucking  anything they do  that's remotely  fucked up  I take up five levels higher  is that  how Danny  because I immediately think  that fucking bitch is being  I immediately go there  angrily  and it's not because  I want to fuck her  I don't think that you  are sexually repressed  with her or anything  and I immediately take it higher  how Danny  like confronts Lily  like that  is that how you argue 
[04:01:00]  in relationships  are you similar to that  your style  that style  like this is what Danny did  that I would do  in a fucking heartbeat  and you can't see it on the radio  but Lily stared at him  for a second  and Danny stared back  like okay go  like that's the type of thing  like what  what do you want  go ahead  yeah I stare  because I'm very set  in my ways I guess  and like if I just believe  that someone acted inappropriately  like I'm not going to  back off of that  and I just feel that  in that situation  there's inappropriate actions  and I'm not backing down from it  and that's just the way it is  hey listen  I'll be the bigger person  I shouldn't have 
[04:01:30]  I shouldn't have questioned  Hip Hop Ronnie  even though he's a fucking liar  but I'm just saying  that's a bigger person  with an asterisk  a little bit  a little bit of an asterisk  there was a moment  where Dan and I did get along  like we didn't really like each other  in the beginning  it was brief  and there was a brief reconciliation  ten minutes  it was a brief moment  and now we don't like each other again  but I mean  other than the way he speaks to me  I really don't have a problem with him  we shared in the dislike of another  you guys would have  oh  you guys would have great angry sex  would we 
[04:02:00]  would we  yeah I think so  what would it take  lots of  cheap white wine  wow  I don't even need the drugs  I need drugs and alcohol  she has to be unconscious  for you  for me to fucking  and so drugged out  she has no recollection of it  I know  Anthony's like  what do I need  she holds up a picture of Terry Schiavo  whatever she took  yeah 
[04:02:30]  nah I know  that's why I never  you know  made any kind of real effort  I mean I knew I didn't have a chance  and you know  I was going out with somebody at the time  so that might have had something to do with it  I fucking  I relate to that though  to Danny?  yeah  and not with Lily  but with that  there's like  if I'm pissed off at a girl  like say she's done something I didn't like  or whatever  we're arguing  there's this thing  where I'm not gonna allow  a fucking hot woman  to do something  that I think is gonna make a fool of me  because I have my weird shit  with women too 
[04:03:00]  so I take anything they do  and fucking  I get so aggravated  do you find yourself being over analytical too  like I'll do this a lot of times  where I feel that someone acts a certain way  just because  they know that they can get the reaction  that they're looking for  because they're a woman  and because  absolutely  because they look a certain way  so I feel a lot of times  I'm not saying this is Lily specific  but I do feel that sometimes chicks run around  thinking a little more than they are  but they're so used to men reacting  in their favor  that that's just how they act all the time 
[04:03:30]  I've  yeah  I've at times interpreted that correctly  at times I've misinterpreted it  because again  it's my own reaction to women  which historically has been awful  I mean I'm extraordinarily insecure  so it's like  and I'm not speaking about you through me  I mean I'm being about me  and I will react  much more  much more visceral reaction  towards a fucking woman  that just reminds me of  bad things that have happened  really?  yeah man  because it's like this fucking  you're not fucking getting over on me  even if they're not  go ahead  sorry Jimmy  no no I'm saying  even if they're not necessarily  trying to get over on me  if it's an argument that's a three 
[04:04:00]  I'll make it a seven and a half  or an eight  because of other shit  like other luggage  that I fucking walked into the room with  but I'm certainly fucking guilty of that  as long as a certain photographer  isn't stomping all over it  I'm missing something here though  I think Lily might act a little differently  when she's not around us  she seems innocent, sweet  no not at all  maybe Than can shed some light on that  during your one date  hey  yes 
[04:04:30]  yeah  well in terms of our date  that was fine  no I mean  Lily does kind of have like  she likes busting balls  obviously she doesn't really bust  your guys balls  because you have  an elevated status  no  listen  because I'm a woman  I'm held at a different standard  so I can't bust balls  but everybody else around you can  that's the thing  that's the fucking bullshit about it  this is where I will stick with Danny  like when we have new interns  regardless of gender  and they think  the best way into our hearts  is to bust our balls back 
[04:05:00]  they're always wrong  always  like it's never worked once  that's just like  that has nothing to do with  your anatomy  that's just how it is  like if people  I mean we  you know  some of us have been here longer  and you know  some people have been here longer than us  so we just try to show  she just wants to bust balls  like the rest of us  how long have you been here  you've been here for how long  probably  almost a year and a half  yeah but I mean  busting  a couple months  busting balls  busting balls is one thing  but like 
[04:05:30]  making demands  and wanting  you know  just acting in that  kind of a fashion  that's completely different  than ball busting  but here's the thing  I wasn't even talking to you  so like  you know what I mean  yeah and luckily I heard  you being like that  I didn't have the argument with you  following that logic  you should  you should fist fight as well  so just because  just because you weren't talking to me  makes it okay  no I'm not saying  but the thing is  that you're acting like  I was saying it to you  because my intern  isn't going to get in your face  the way I will  okay so  you spoke like that to him  because you knew  that you could take advantage  because he's just an intern  but I didn't even 
[04:06:00]  honestly like  if you asked anybody around here  and if they  if you said  hey is Lily  a really mean  bitchy  cunty girl  and I guarantee you  maybe two would say yes  but most people would say no  why does  because I'm nice to fucking  everybody around here  I really am  why does the Opie and Anthony show  don't like girls  I don't get it  don't like girls  I don't get it  what's wrong with Lily  I love Opie  oh Steve  well Steve of course  doesn't like girls  yeah you like Lily don't you  Lily's cool  yeah  I love Steve  I mean if 
[04:06:30]  I  I don't know if I witnessed  the event that they're  bickering about  no you weren't here  I wasn't there  no  you wouldn't know  what does he mean  I don't know  we wanted to go home early  thanks Lily  thanks Lily  yeah we were doing  line of the day  at like  quarter to ten  that's right  and people were starting to bitch  how many girls would not freak out  while someone was shitting in their hat  she didn't love it  but she did  alright go ahead  shitting it  that's true  that's a year  that's a year and a half  that was teamed up  with that fucking freak show  that's called  the Rana Fez show 
[04:07:00]  I really like that hat though  yeah that was a good hat  it's right there in the garbage  if you want  it's in the garbage  you can get it dry cleaned probably  yeah I can send somebody out  send an intern out  you take my shit hat  to the dry cleaner  that's something that she would do  yeah  that's how you would act  and that's why I'm  being this way  towards you  but there's rankage  so like me and Pepper Hicks  have been here for like  a year and a half  so the interns under us  we do have a little bit of 
[04:07:30]  authority over them  a little bit  I'm amazed that you're  considered an intern  I'm amazed too  believe me  I'm fucking amazed  when I listen to Rana Fez  Ron talks the most  then Eastside Dave  then Lily  and then Fez  so  why aren't you getting paid  we got big tongue  Tony  Tony  I'm just wondering  because I've been here  like over two years  could I boss the whole  Rana Fez staff around  besides Johnny  yeah  you can boss our interns around  absolutely  you've been here  for two fucking years  dude today's the first time  I ever saw you  Tony do you want lunch today  I swear to god 
[04:08:00]  I never noticed you  I gotta go home  oh man  because I would love to have  buy Tony lunch today  and I'd like Lily to go get it  so you buy that check  you did  yeah  nothing  fuck I have no clue  who this guy is  that sucked  glad no one heard it  hey Ann  could you hit that car crash button  okay  thanks  thank you  excuse me  but I can believe that sucked ass  I'll listen on the replay  and I'll see that it was appropriate  yeah just remember  I should be fucking  I should be talking to Trixie  and Ed Norton  since my fucking  Alice crammed in lines 
[04:08:30]  okay Ralph  cunt I am  well we're gonna get Lily paid  she should be getting paid  we gotta get  Pat Duffy paid  yeah Duffy absolutely  has to get  gotta get  you said Dave more money  and Pepper Hicks  I don't know Pepper  no no  Tony's  Tony's standing at the door  and no one's acknowledging  any money for him  I don't even know  Tony don't get paid  no of course not  we're gonna get  Don Wicklund fired  that'll free up a lot of money  these guys have been here for this long  I mean we gotta  you can't  they do a lot of shit for the shows 
[04:09:00]  I mean honestly  I think of you  because I don't listen to Ron Efezel a lot  because I'm in bed  I go home and nap  but every time I turn a show on  you're on it  so it's like  you're almost an on air member of the staff  they should be paying you  XM should be paying you  and Tony and fucking Duffy  he's a fucking animal  how's Duffy not getting paid  and Duffy's an animal  I know you're just throwing Tony in there  because he's sitting at the door  of course I am  but no  Tony's good  he comes up with a lot of great bits  Tony's a fucking  he's a good creator of bits  yeah  no offense to Pat Duffy  but I mean  you're just putting shit all over yourself  I mean  that's a lot  I've been working hard behind the scenes 
[04:09:30]  for two years  that's a lot  not that Deuce Chill Theater  wasn't terrific  hold on  but Tony's onto something  continue Tony  I mean  it's  think about  you're saying it's easy  to put shit all over your face  but what you're doing  I'm living in my parents' basement  I'm 27  you know  it's ridiculous  like I got no money  I'm gonna put shit on your head  and everybody wants you  I went to broadcasting school  for Christ's sake  Tony  what's harder to replace though  let's think  looking for a man 
[04:10:00]  to sit in production room  and come up with bits  looking for a man  who will eat puke  and rub homeless man shit  on their nose  which application  is coming back faster  I understand  you see what I'm saying  you're very valuable  but Duffy is  a different breed  I don't want to get into  you know  who's more good for the show  because I like Duffy  but  yeah  alright  well we  we did a lot here today  yeah that  wow  I think  Danny  do you want to come sit on my lap  and we can make up  aww  look at that 
[04:10:30]  aww  alright  why not  see I'm trying  I'm reaching out  because I'm not  why would I do that  why not  why would I  why would I patronize  wow  her like that  I  I could just sit here  and talk to you  and we could have a conversation  okay  Jimmy sit on the  well I'm trying  I don't have to sit on your stupid lap  don't say that  it's not stupid  no I can't  she didn't ask me  we're not quarreling  you can come sit on my lap  no I really shouldn't  I mean  I really shouldn't  I mean considering the fact  that we're not quarreling  just don't  fart on me  aww  there we go  there 
[04:11:00]  just don't  I feel stupid  if I had to fart right now  I would fucking  I'd  Christopher Reeve her legs  but I don't have to  believe me  I've never wanted to gasser  as much as I did  at that moment  hey this is Isaac Hayes  and you're listening  to the worst  of Opie and Anthem  so here  there's a lot going on  so the Carpenters  sang this originally  you might  recognize this song  here it is  just a piece  I remember this 
[04:11:30]  damn this fat bitch  could sing  fat bitch  fat bitch  get to the chorus  then we'll all know it  for the second show  Jimmy I'm going to turn you on  to another song today  that you'll have on your  your iPod  by the end of the day  this is great  well this  the original's good  but wait till you hear  what Sonic Youth did  I've never heard this  it's nice 
[04:12:00]  she did have a very good voice  she sure did  there was no food  going down there  to fuck anything up  no  just water  and  oh fucking  the vomit  cleansed the vocal cords  yes  the fucking  the acid  the brown back  of the teeth  from the fucking  stomach bile  here's the hook  fucking awful breath  nice horns  from the 70s  exactly  had to have horns  in the 70s right  wow  that's the wind  going through her ears  all right 
[04:12:30]  that's good enough  so that's  so that's the original  on the Juno soundtrack  walking trombone  she sang with her face  in the toilet  that's why she has  that nice echo  those are fucking  lyrics bouncing off  the water  before puke comes out  fucking  like a hearty meal  of a carrot stick  exactly  oh  I'm gonna treat myself  I'm gonna have  a garbanzo bean  garbanzo  microphone shaped  like an index finger  so the soundtrack 
[04:13:00]  which is  oh  smelly knuckles  which is  which is  oh  smelly knuckles  so the soundtrack 
[04:13:30]  which is interesting  getting a little buzz  right there  rolling the soundtrack  yeah  it's not for everybody  though  it's a little  it's a little  indie  a little wimpy  but they have  this song on there  same song you just heard  done by Sonic Youth  listen to the difference  in the song  oh  creepy  he sounds like  she felt  I fell in love 
[04:14:00]  with you  sounds like a serial  killer singing a song  right  yeah  how cool is this  though  this is Juno  off the Juno  soundtrack  I think they did  this years ago  to be honest with you  I'm not discovering  anything new  but it's new to me  you just saw my  musical youth  pass the duchy  that's a good one  the hook is coming up  listen to this 
[04:14:30]  it's just the radio  don't you remember  you told me  you loved me baby  you said you'd be  coming back this way  yeah  baby  baby baby  baby baby  baby  oh  baby  I love you  really do  isn't that wild
