<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts recounting their recent television appearances. Opie discussed his time on "Red Eye," while Anthony detailed his experience on "Late Night with David Letterman," including interactions with the writers and a post-show ride in producer Kenny’s new car.  Their conversation was filled with crude humor and sexual innuendo, particularly concerning their missed dinner plans due to a perceived large distance between their hotels.  They also discussed their frustrations with email services (Opie's issues with Yahoo Mail) and Anthony's sleep deprivation. The segment included anxieties about their professions, television editing, and criticisms of waterboarding and the swine flu, along with jokes about Greg Gutfeld and Andy Levy.  Kenny's unexpected disco DJ appearance on their SiriusXM show became a humorous running gag, further punctuated by speculation about his musical tastes and a near-miss prank involving Jimmy Kimmel's girlfriend.

The show then transitioned to a pre-show anecdote about quieting down other guests,  followed by announcements of upcoming guests: Bill Burr (all week), Al Jackson (first appearance), and Maury Povich (with joking suggestions to skip him due to predictability).  They mentioned an "air scare" and upcoming "Real Rock TV" videos, including a graphic and sexually suggestive "mime video" featuring Anthony. Opie discussed his strained relationship with his mother and Mother's Day plans, leading into a lengthy, comedic ProFlowers ad.  Further "Real Rock TV" video discussions included Opie skateboarding (described hyperbolically), Rocco, Billy Idol, and an IRS-related skit.  This led to conversations about dangerous motorcycle driving, replete with racial stereotypes, and previews of interviews with musicians Deshwala and the Black Crows (with Anthony's experience with the latter being particularly scathing).  The segment was rife with offensive and sexually explicit jokes and concluded with a discussion and critique of a P. Diddy song and a Rochester, New York news story about a Popeye's chicken shortage, focusing on the apparent racial homogeneity of the interviewees. A song about fried chicken was then played and critiqued.

The next segment opened with a discussion of a video showing a woman feeding her children while driving, spawning a nonsensical "Fry that chicken!" bit.  This transitioned into a *South Park* episode mocking Kanye West (repeatedly called a "gay fish"), followed by heavy criticism of P. Diddy's career, musical talent, and name changes.  Audio clips of P. Diddy’s music were played, analyzing his sampling, particularly Led Zeppelin.  A comedic segment featured Kenny attempting a Diddy-esque rap spelling out the hosts' names.  The discussion included Susan Boyle's *Britain's Got Talent* appearance, a supposed leprechaun sighting, and the arrival of guests Bill Burr and Al Jackson.  Conversations covered Burr's stand-up and Jackson's warm-up experiences.  Further critique of P. Diddy's marketing contrasted with opinions on his talent, expanding to critiques of other fashion brands.  The segment concluded with discussions of a low-flying 747 over Manhattan, 9/11, waterboarding, the Mariel boatlift, childhood anecdotes, sibling rivalries, and Maury Povich’s arrival. Povich discussed his show, his age, and a recent paternity test.

A substantial portion of the show focused on the Maury Povich Show, dissecting paternity tests, the dramatic reactions of women, and segments featuring unusual phobias (specifically a woman with a fear of cotton balls and a "Cotton Ball Man").  The hosts speculated humorously about Maury's behind-the-scenes interactions.  Maury Povich himself was a guest, discussing his show's move to Stamford, Connecticut.  Other guests included Bill Burr, Jill (with a fear of cotton), an unnamed woman with a salad aversion, and a recording of a rap song by Kenny was played.  The hosts mocked a previous interview with Dr. Michio Kaku, and the conversation frequently devolved into crude and sexually suggestive humor, including discussions of "teen whores."  Maury's golf hobby was also briefly discussed.

The final segment began with anecdotes about inappropriate sexual encounters witnessed by a teacher, leading to discussions about teacher salaries, summer breaks, teenage sexuality, and sexting.  This transitioned into listener complaints about Bill Burr's podcast file size, followed by a discussion of aggressive telemarketing for extended car warranties.  An interview segment with Keith Evans, a former telemarketing employee, detailed high-pressure sales techniques and alleged violations of the "do not call" list.  Nakia Hill and Jessica Phillips were also mentioned as former employees with similar grievances, as was a defensive interview with Jason Iyer. The hosts discussed various scams targeting the elderly, including water filter scams, pyramid schemes, and romantic scams, with personal anecdotes and a story involving Adam Ferrara and a water filter scam.  The show concluded with extended, highly offensive mockery of "Bob," focusing on his perceived lack of intelligence, particularly regarding politics and the swine flu, and the playing of a rap song.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.  Hello. Hello. Hello, hello.  Oh, hi there. Governor.  I want to do an English show.  Hello, Governor.  Oh, oh. Oi. 
[00:00:30]  Good morning.  Let's just fuck up this place today.  Yeah.  Let's tear it up.  Sledgehammers for everyone.  Ah, like the good old days.  Sledgehammers came in very handy.  A lot of TV being done last night, huh?  Oh, this show is a virtual fucking TV wonderland.  I think I'm about to jump back in, too.  You jumping on ship?  I think I'm jumping back in.  Jump in.  It's fun. 
[00:01:00]  It's all right.  You get in there.  You just, you babble.  You're on television.  People are like, ooh.  That's all it takes.  I didn't know which way to go yesterday.  You're down the street doing red-eye.  Jimmy's doing Letterman.  Well, obviously, you two had dinner afterwards, and it was way out of where I was.  I didn't know you were, I forgot you were, I thought you were doing red-eye Wednesday for some reason.  I didn't think you were doing it last night.  I'm doing it all week.  Oh, all right.  I'm teasing, of course.  No, I'm not. 
[00:01:30]  I'm not that good.  You don't communicate with anyone.  That's why.  Yeah, I would love to.  We would all love to hook up.  Jimmy communicated with me and said, you two, or actually three, we're having dinner.  Right.  So I was like, oh, where?  So I figured it was going to be near Letterman, and I was in Times Square, and he goes, oh,  Harlem, or it was somewhere uptown.  No, Time Warner building, it's on 59th Street.  Yeah, exactly, Harlem.  It was way uptown.  It was six blocks away. 
[00:02:00]  Way uptown.  We were in the middle.  Actually, wait, I got to go with that, because in Anthony's world, that is way uptown.  Oh, yeah, it's giant.  Because Anthony has this hotel he loves staying at.  I know.  And he was doing Red Eye, and I'm like, dude, just stay at the same freaking hotel and walk  the five blocks, six blocks, or take a cab.  He goes, oh, no, that's too far.  First time I broke loyalty.  Yeah, so you had to get another hotel that's closer to Red Eye.  Which I love, by the way.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, do I love it.  So there you go.  It's perfect.  So we were a mere six blocks away from the Letterman Theater, and that's way too far.  But I was six blocks south.  Twelve blocks.  You couldn't go twelve blocks to meet us for dinner?  You know what it was, though?  I assumed, because it was so late also, that you guys were kind of finishing up.  We were at least in the middle of it, I think.  Yeah, I thought, if it was like, hey, Anthony, we're just having dinner.  Why don't you join us? 
[00:03:00]  We're just up the street.  I'd have gone, all right.  See, and that's the difference, too, because there's something in my household called,  are your eyes spinning?  And I go, yeah.  And she knows we've got to go home.  To you, that means that the night's just beginning.  It means more drinks.  After the Letterman taping, Jimmy's like, you want to get some dinner?  And I'm like, oof, if we can make this fast.  It's already nine o'clock at night.  I've got to be in bed by ten.  I was up for probably three hours by nine o'clock. 
[00:03:30]  I went to the hotel after leaving the studios here and slept from probably 11 o'clock until 6.30.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I had a full night's sleep right after the show.  Oh, my God.  It was fantastic.  I woke up all panicky.  I'm like, no, I'm going to be late for red eye. 
[00:04:00]  And then, my email address, Yahoo email sucks a dick.  Sure.  I've got to say right now, and I know you guys have been trying to get me on Gmail.  Gmail rules.  I've been sticking with Yahoo.  People will email me stuff.  I'll email myself stuff and not get it for three hours.  And I needed the notes for red eye.  Yep.  The subject notes. 
[00:04:30]  And I needed to send back, like, my notes and shit.  So, nothing.  I got nothing.  Kenny got an email to him and forwarded it to me.  And I got it that way.  Yeah.  But Yahoo stinks for mail.  I'm done with it.  Done.  I have Gmail, too.  I was with AOL for years just with mail.  Yeah.  And then I went with Gmail, too.  And it's like, it is better.  Although, sometimes it takes a while to send.  I have a lot of times it's a bitch to send it.  But someone cares if I'm sending. 
[00:05:00]  That's true.  I just want to receive.  It's like sex.  I just want to get it.  I don't care about giving.  But a lot of times you've got to send the cockpick out to you and a vagina pick back.  Now, here's the order of which it happened.  You don't want to advertise that you don't give, by the way.  No.  I don't give.  9.26 p.m.  I text Anthony.  How was Red Eye, sweetie?  He texts me back.  Great.  Just got out.  How was Letterman?  I say it was really good.  Out eating with open his girl.  Oh, where at? 
[00:05:30]  Time Warner Building.  Where are you?  Ah.  48th and 7th.  My hotel is here.  I'll just grab it.  I'm like, I'd love to meet you, but I'm lazy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me explain.  That is exactly.  Let me explain for the people that aren't in New York City.  You're right.  Thank you.  Because we feel a little guiltier.  You were a mere 11 blocks away and then maybe one block over.  So 12 blocks.  That's 11 major blocks.  In a cab.  That's a three.  It's Times Square blocks.  Dude.  That's a three-minute cab, bro. 
[00:06:00]  Times Square blocks.  No, those are avenues different.  Blocks are lengthwise.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Also, also, mind you, those are southbound streets.  What?  I got to go to fucking, what, 8th?  No.  Yeah.  Where do I got to walk?  Yeah, you go away.  I got to walk to fucking 8th.  No, you grab one on South.  Dude, you're insane.  You're insane.  You grab one on, like.  Shut up.  Grab one on the 40s.  Are you still drunk?  Yes.  I think you might be.  You grab one on the 40s.  Cab bags are right.  It's up all night. 
[00:06:30]  Goes to 8th Avenue north to Broadway, and you're there.  Wait a minute.  You were up all night?  No.  I could have.  Yeah.  I was up pretty much.  I had a nap.  Anything fun?  Nah.  Just watching.  I watched Red Eye.  And scrapped a load all by yourself on your stomach.  I was like, ooh, I'm good.  Guac.  Guac.  There's nothing worse than watching yourself on TV and jerking off.  It's fucking horrible.  Like, God, I'd let an old lady blow me right now.  It's like anything. 
[00:07:00]  I was actually saying, why isn't Jimmy on?  No.  I was saying the same thing watching you.  No.  I was in front of my hotel.  A big boo to you.  I was in front of my hotel.  And you got the invite from Jimmy.  You should have came by.  No.  You know what it was?  I asked where you guys were.  It wasn't an invite that wasn't reciprocated.  But if we were in the same hotel, I think it would have been, ah, the 8th floor.  You know I'm on the 5th.  You know.  The elevation. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  It was, um, yeah.  We should have planned it beforehand.  I didn't think to plan it before.  That's true.  We should have probably planned it before.  It's hard.  Like, once you're back in your room already, you're ready to get some room service.  I know.  That's what I did.  I got room service.  Everything was dandy.  I had fun on Red Eye.  The show's fun, man.  It's great.  Yeah.  It's great.  A lot of fun.  Greg's an animal.  He really is.  He is one of those guys, though, when something kind of trips up a little bit, ooh, does he  lose his fucking mind? 
[00:08:00]  Ooh, fuck.  Yeah, he's got a short fuse.  I guess the executive producer was out or something.  And, uh, they had someone standing in, and, uh, everyone was saying the show's just  going to be a clusterfuck, and, uh, yeah, there were a couple of little faux pas that  happened during the show.  Uh, something was supposed to happen that didn't happen, and, uh, Greg is just there staring  at the camera for, like, ten seconds straight, and then went, what the fuck is going on?  I just lost his mind. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, he's had it.  Oh, and I'm laughing, because it's just funny to watch someone lose their mind.  It's great to watch someone else fucking unravel.  I just got to kick back and go, I'm waiting for the cameras to go on.  I don't care.  I love when funny people get really pissed off, and then the next thing you know, they  have to go back to being funny.  There's nothing better.  Oh, was he infuriated?  That was great.  Then he's the lovable host in mere minutes.  Then he's like, where are we?  What are we doing?  Okay.  Well, if you pay any attention to what's in the news now, it's like, aha, look, he was 
[00:09:00]  mad a second ago.  Well, Ant, I was on Red Eye last night.  And he talks about the pig flu.  Look what we do for the people.  Wow.  This is like I just did it.  And someone, you know what?  Someone got the swine flu right there in Times Square.  No way.  One person in the Times Square area, one of the big companies in Times Square.  Which one?  I don't know.  Close to you, though.  Really close.  No.  Oh, yeah.  It's in the paper today.  But they're fine.  It's all Mexicans.  But they're fine.  This is like the bird flu. 
[00:09:30]  Just substitute bird, put in swine, major panic for everybody for about a month, and  then it goes away until we figure out the next animal flu.  Well, Opie, I did find out that the swine flu is a combination of the swine flu, the bird  flu.  See?  Ah!  And?  And people flu.  And throw in a little Legionnaires?  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I hope not.  I don't know.  Anthony, you must remember the swine flu.  Oh, yeah, yeah, from way back.  I remember Typhoid Mary.  Yeah.  That's how I'm feeling.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  But in New York, it was people that went to spring break in Mexico, came back and got  it.  Mm-hmm.  And if you go to spring break in Mexico and come back with a flu, count your blessings.  Yeah.  At least your s*** won't fall off.  And also, if you're not drinking enough to kill Ebola on spring break in Mexico, you're  not doing the job.  It is scary, though.  You know, I hopefully, this is where I become serious.  Wait, what did you say that they bleeped?  Dick or balls?  I said schlong, which I thought would make it through, is why I didn't say fat fucking 
[00:10:30]  cock.  Wow.  You should have just went with fat fucking cock.  Yeah, if they're going to bleep it, I should have went with fat fucking cock.  That brings up a pretty interesting comment from a lot of people.  There was a lot of editing and bleeping on last night's red eye.  Yeah, I think maybe they might be getting censored more than they used to be.  Abu.  Now that they're getting more exposure.  Yeah.  Well, we know how that is, though.  The more exposure you get, they hold you back more.  They hold you back more.  That's just brilliant, isn't it?  When you're flying under the radar, you're good. 
[00:11:00]  That's just brilliant, though.  Yeah.  People are starting to dig your show, so let's now make it safe.  Let's f*** it up.  That's so stupid.  You know, we've noticed people are really listening now from what you've been doing,  so keep doing it.  We'll cut it, and hopefully the people will go away.  Right.  No more Asian jokes.  Assholes.  No more homeless shopping spree, no more, here's more red eye with it.  None of the fun.  Hey, Anthony, why would anybody want to do the dirty work that needs to be done when 
[00:11:30]  they know that your government isn't going to have your back when you're doing it?  Yeah, that's your job, and now you might be prosecuted for doing your job?  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Again, Obama should just step in and stop this immediately.  And the fact that waterboarding, I'm sick of hearing about waterboarding and the fact  that it's torture.  The reason it's torture, a lot of the detainees, it's the first time water's ever touched their  body.  And I think soapboarding should be next.  Soapboarding.  Soapboarding. 
[00:12:00]  How about some waxing?  Do we really?  Women undergo that.  They need some waxing.  Women undergo this torture every week.  Well, that's a great angle on the waterboarding.  Who are they?  Because they're savages that don't bathe.  Who is the broad trying to get in there?  Ah, you know, some broad.  Some broad?  I don't pay attention to people's names.  I'm the star.  You have no idea.  Yeah, I know.  I like that, though.  There's a beauty in that.  Totally kidding.  And that waterboarding joke is great.  And that nugget of Anthony Saul right there that you just saw. 
[00:12:30]  I'm so kidding.  I know.  I go in there thinking I'm shit, and I leave knowing I'm shit.  I know.  Believe me.  I hope I eked out enough where people don't just laugh at me.  When the guy introduced Anthony, his low self-esteem, all Anthony hears is garbage.  You're on garbage and garbage in the morning.  Yes, garbage, shit, and now shit.  Here's crap.  Welcome.  You don't remember who the broad was, though?  Like, what did she do for a living?  Comedian.  Politician.  A lot of them work at Fox.  A lot of women work at Fox.  Yeah, yeah, they do.  They work at Fox. 
[00:13:00]  They just bring them in from down the hall.  She's cute, you know.  She's very cute.  Put the peanut butter.  And it talks about effects of Ambien.  I once ate an entire loaf of lemon poppy sea bread.  And have no memory other than when I woke up and I found it all torn apart on the floor.  Your pillow was gone.  My pillow was gone.  Are married men now going to start taking Ambien as an excuse?  Ambien does make you do weird things.  And as an excuse, it is pretty weak. 
[00:13:30]  But something similar ruined my marriage.  I took two Tylenol and ended up in a threesome.  I don't know.  Is that weird?  Yeah.  I did not know about that side effect.  The pain went away, but I had to pay our millions.  So the pain continues, is what you're saying.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, ooh, it's high on fire.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, isn't that almost done there, eh?  I haven't kept track of that lately.  What, the old, uh, old? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ixnay.  Getting close that way?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Next break, I'll fill you in.  What?  What?  Tick a lock.  What?  Tick a lock.  Yeah.  That's when you go on your mouth.  Well, if we whisper, no one else will hear this.  Turn the key on your mouth like a lock.  Oh, what?  Did someone say something?  Yes.  I thought I heard something. 
[00:14:30]  Did an asshole say something?  Everyone was whispering.  It frightened me.  It frightened.  Yeah, but if we whisper, they don't hear us out there.  So what's going on?  Shh.  Oh, God, I can't.  What?  Really?  Oh, my God.  No way.  What?  Hey, Anthony, when you see people who are really, really tanned, don't you immediately judge  them as weirdos?  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like an unhealthy thing to do.  It's great when you talk about a young teen in the bikini on the beach getting tanned, but 
[00:15:00]  by the time they're in their mid-20s, I don't know, that tough skin, that little tramp  stamp looks like a pen exploded on a saddle.  It's like having sex with a lazy boy.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a chair, by the way, Greg.  Did you just say when they reach their mid-20s?  Well, yeah, if they start tanning at 16.  And by their mid-20s, they're looking a little rough? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, yeah, then the tramp stamp looks like a pen exploded on a saddle.  Yes.  Well, that's not girls that stay out of the sun.  Right.  I'm talking about girls that have been, you know, where their tits look like fucking  wine satchels.  But in their mid-20s, they're looking like that.  Some girls tan too much.  Tan too much.  Oh, right, right.  Okay.  You ever see those?  They're all fucking like...  Yeah, I would think mid-30s, mid-40s. 
[00:16:00]  Never heard mid-20s, that's all.  I like letting people know where I stand.  I understand.  You're advertising.  I love it.  Andy Levy asks Ant why he's never been invited on O&A.  Yeah, he wants to be on the show.  He's supposed to be like a...  Ant is funny, man.  He's like a movie critic or something like that, too.  He's very funny, yeah.  Which one is he on the show?  He's the guy that does the halftime report.  And at the end...  He's got like a really weird vibe to him.  Oh, fuck, I love that guy.  Yeah, we should have...  Very sarcastic, very dry wit.  Bill actually wants to come on, too. 
[00:16:30]  They love the show.  I'd love to have Bill, too.  Whoa, Bill!  Stupid douche paper makes me laugh.  I know.  How funny.  It was right next to me.  You saw my shirt whenever it talked.  I know.  By the way, anyone who watches Red Eye, Pinchy is Bill.  Oh, you ruined the whole illusion.  I know.  I didn't know it.  Even when he was sitting next to me, I'm like,  why are you touching the paper?  Oh, you're moving the mouth.  I didn't get it.  I'm an idiot.  I'm slow.  Time to go back to TV's Andy Levy for the post-game wrap-up.  Thanks, sir.  Hey, Anthony, you've had Greg on your little radio show. 
[00:17:00]  How come not me or Bill?  And more specifically, how come not me?  No one knows you.  That is funny because it's sadly true.  I had a feeling it was some kind of technical reason like that.  You do have striking blue eyes, though, I must admit.  Well, thank you.  They come across really well on satellite radio.  Visual.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, that's funny.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I had to give him a jab.  Poor Andy.  You don't know if he's going with the bit. 
[00:17:30]  It really hurts.  Yeah, I know.  I feel bad.  That is a great bit they do with that, what, halftime?  Yeah, a little halftime.  That is really good.  Very nice, Andy.  Good job on the red eye.  It was a lot of fun.  I love those guys.  I'll do it any time.  Yeah.  God felt should have came in here yesterday.  Maybe tomorrow.  I'm doing it tomorrow.  Busy man.  New studio, by the way.  Yes, looks good.  Which is nice.  And they got seats there.  Because I guess they do the, what's that morning show they do over there with the friggin'  Juliet and Mike and Juliet? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, him and her, whatever it is.  The Regis and Kelly show for another network.  And they have an audience in there.  And occasionally, you know, they could bring people in.  I was saying you should bring people in over there.  I don't think he likes that idea.  No?  I don't know.  Greg, maybe Goodfell would go for that.  Goodfell's just thinking.  They should do a live show.  Oh, and any audience members?  Forget about it.  Oh, that would be crazy.  I mean, literally, forget about it.  Never do it.  It's a horrible idea.  Yeah, they're very cool over there, though.  Love Jimmy.  All I hear about is Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. 
[00:18:30]  You know what it's like to go over there as one of the personalities that are going on  the show and have to hear about Jimmy.  It's got to be head.  Jimmy's so funny.  Jimmy's so sweet.  I love Jimmy.  Jimmy does so good when he's here.  I'm like, ugh, enough.  I'm here.  You've got to hear that when you walk into a girl's house.  All I do is concur.  I concur. 
[00:19:00]  Jimmy rules.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  So Obe came last night.  I tape Letterman, it airs Friday.  Anyway, it did not air last night.  You sneaky little shit.  You didn't let anyone know.  I only found out last week that I was doing it.  Yeah, exactly.  Last week.  Nah, but I didn't know if I was ready.  I was, uh...  Ready for what?  It's a talk show.  You go on, you be Jimmy.  That's what I was doing.  He wasn't...  Yeah, and he wasn't sure if he was going to, like, actually go through with it.  I got the call a couple weeks ago.  Okay, can you do it in May?  How many cunts did you, uh...  Four.  All right.  But they said, as long as you act like it's being spelled with a K, it's exemptible. 
[00:19:30]  But I'm like, all right, let me see if I can get the material together.  And then Eddie calls me a few days later and goes, hey, can you do it Monday?  Oh, shit.  This was last Tuesday.  I'm like, um...  No!  Give me a night.  Let me just see if I can put this together and time it.  It was timing out two and a half minutes too long.  So I talked to him the next time.  I'm like, okay, I can do it.  But I didn't say anything because I was like, let me just do it.  I knew it was air on Friday.  I could plug it.  You're afraid of the jinx.  It was too soon.  I was so wrapped up in getting everything together for it and timing it out.  I was just doing sets every night. 
[00:20:00]  It was a last minute booking, really.  Completely last week because Regan had to move his dates.  He's like, look, we got this opening.  Do you want to do it instead of...  They're like, we want to get you on a sweep.  So I'm like, all right, it was great.  And so it was with Keeper Sutherland and the band was actually really good too.  I forget what they were called.  Who was that shit?  A new band.  I liked them.  I don't know who they are.  Back something?  Yeah.  Ting Ting's?  No, not the Tammy.  That's for Lashes.  I love the Ting Ting's.  Kind of had that 80s sound happening.  Yeah, they were good.  That sound is coming back big.  And in the dressing room, there were cookies. 
[00:20:30]  Lots and lots of cookies.  And wonderfulness.  They were so fucking good.  Oak took them home when he brought them in today for the staff.  So the girl, who's our intern?  Jill.  Yeah.  She made cookies once too.  Oh, Jill!  Jesus, man.  She came in and I was talking about the cookies.  I don't know if we're going to be able to keep up with it today.  Oh, we'll keep up.  I was talking about the Letterman cookies.  Oh, my God.  And I'm like, they were so good, those cookies.  And Jill walks in and she goes, really?  And it's like, no one was talking about your cookies, stupid. 
[00:21:00]  We were talking about Letterman's cookies.  Oh, shit.  I was scared to eat her cookies.  Fuck those cow patties she calls cookies.  I'll throw them at her.  Oh, the poor girl.  And they were actually tasty.  And the only reason she brought in the cookies was because she thought she might get fired  because she missed a day.  Why'd she miss a day?  I don't know.  We didn't even know.  But she was a guy.  We didn't even know this.  Would have been fired, yeah.  Yeah, we need Jill around.  Was the string hanging out?  Yeah.  I had one of the cookies.  I was like, what is this?  It's a chocolate clot. 
[00:21:30]  Cookie sauce.  Is this maraschino cherry?  Exactly.  Stop bringing in your fucking, your awful bought cookies.  Where is she right now?  I don't know.  She's right over there.  20 miles down the hallway.  She's over there.  Jesus.  She's behind the curtain, sorry.  Oh, okay.  I can see her from my point of view.  I'll be fucking whore plugging this fucking appearance all week.  When is it now?  Friday?  Friday and Friday night.  Friday.  And I'm on second, not last.  Which is cool.  Why do they tape a show this early in the week? 
[00:22:00]  I forgot.  We were talking about that exact thing yesterday.  I always thought Letterman did two shows on Thursday, because he's another guy that gets  the four-day work week that we're slowly but surely working ourselves toward.  But he tapes the second show on a Monday, so by Friday, even the writers, who are really  big fans of the show, they're like, man, if there's a big news story, we are so fucked.  Well, they actually just...  Wow, yeah.  That's the only thing that is a problem, taping this Friday show so early.  And occasionally they'll have to reshoot the monologue, which actually they'll do. 
[00:22:30]  I mean, I just shoot it like the night before, but I think Letterman, because he had his  heart surgery, so he's probably like, you know, it's probably tough.  He's probably like, fuck it, man.  I just want to relax and have a week, you know.  If they're quadruple bypass, you're probably like, fuck this.  He's a workaholic.  I know.  Everyone knows he's a workaholic, but he just does it in a four-day work week.  Those guys are great, too.  Justin and Eric, the writers, are great dudes.  Those guys rule.  Those guys rule.  But the set was great.  Jimmy did five minutes, and it's going to be fine. 
[00:23:00]  Very energy.  I was very happy with it.  Yeah, I'm very happy with it.  He got an applause break during the taping.  Stop it.  Every horror comic does.  You just try not to pause for them.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Did you put on the sincere thank you face?  Like Rupert Pupkin?  You put your arms out and just go, yeah?  He did the, oh.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, the pause break.  Like, oh, wow.  Jerry.  I didn't see this coming.  I was so happy with it.  This is why fucking Kenny is no friend.  I was so happy with the set.  Oh, did he suck. 
[00:23:30]  You called him six feet of cancer.  He really is.  Oh, no.  What did he do?  I was so happy with the set.  He just ruins everything.  And, you know, I judge things fairly accurately.  I don't ever think I hear things that they call laugh ears.  Like, the Ed Sullivan Theater for a comedian is set up so fucking good.  Because you walk out, and there's no camera.  The cameras are being pulled back.  They're behind the audience and zoomed in.  So, I'm standing there.  You're doing a theater gig.  You're just doing a gig for a bunch of people.  It's amazing for a comedian.  And I come out. 
[00:24:00]  I feel great.  I love the energy in the room.  I felt like they were a great crowd.  And I came out, and Kenny goes, were they a little uptight?  And I'm like, no.  What are you not?  And I don't need to hear you were great.  Believe me.  I don't fucking need that ever.  But it's like I knew how it went from where on the stage.  Yeah.  And I was like, what the fuck?  Why would he say that?  Was he right outside the stage door?  No, he was in the green room.  And he said he couldn't hear that good, which is possibly he couldn't.  Well, because the green room was completely packed.  We saw it upstairs in your dressing room.  So, we got a nice shot at the TV and the audience reaction. 
[00:24:30]  It was a perfect set.  I was very happy.  Even if they were.  And Kenny goes, I don't even think he used stale.  He said some weird word.  Stuffy.  Stuffy, yes.  Yeah, okay.  Stuffy.  Like his head.  Like the fuck, Stuffy.  Shit, his head is stuffed with shit.  Kenny's the worst.  We've said it a million times.  He has no bedside manner.  No.  The guy is the worst.  But I'm happy.  You're out of your mind that you're going to be on that Letterman stage.  And that's not what you want to hear ever.  But I felt completely comfortable and completely relaxed performing. 
[00:25:00]  And like, I just, they were a really good crowd.  Like, you can feel the energy when you walk out.  Like, I've had times where you know what TV laughs are supposed to sound like.  Like, you know when they're like, huh?  Huh?  And you know when they're like, it's like a full laugh through.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You can just tell all your fucking pacing and everything.  And I felt great.  So we'll see how it looks.  I hope I didn't misjudge it on stage.  And I know you're like your worst critic.  Yeah, absolutely.  I've talked to you after gigs when I thought it was amazing.  And you go like, oh, well, yeah, I didn't feel good about this or that. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, you look for what didn't work.  So to feel good and then have Dummy say that they were stuffy.  Were they stuffy?  You want to kill him.  He just wonders why he's friendless.  He doesn't have a soul.  He's a cyborg.  You know, every time I watch 48 Hours, that show with the, you know, they show murders  and then how to solve the murders and how the cops solve the murders. 
[00:26:00]  They always go, well, now we're driving to the family's house.  We have to get an ID and tell these people.  And they always go, you know, this is the worst part of the job.  They always say this.  You know, it's the hardest part of the job is telling people that they've lost a family member.  Every time that happens, all I think of now is Kenny going, your son is dead.  Your mom was shot.  She's dead.  Goodbye.  But the angle on that, if they had a candid interview with Kenny, he goes, 
[00:26:30]  got to tell you, this is the best part of the job.  He'd be driving.  They'd show the camera from the past.  Well, another lucky day for me.  Someone's dead.  He would be whistling a happy tune.  Yeah, he'd love it.  Oh, speaking of whistling a happy tune, after the letterman taping, we jumped into Kenny's ride.  His new ride.  Oh, his new whip.  He got a new whip.  As they say, new whip.  And we're here on SiriusXM.  Everyone knows that by now.  And there is, I don't know, 120-something music channels. 
[00:27:00]  Well, I forget what the advertising is.  Sure.  A shitload.  He was on, we should have people guess what fucking channel he loves.  Dude.  Their Funeral Dirge channel?  No.  We don't even have to go to the phones.  What channel do you think Club Soda Kenny listens to, Anthony?  I'll put it this way.  When he turned the button on, a cock actually popped out of the speaker.  It's not the out cue.  It's not the gay station.  What would I think Kenny would listen to on a platform with hundreds of formats? 
[00:27:30]  I want to say some kind of, that's all I can think of, some kind of, yeah, just some  big Addams Family organ sounding, horrible thing, the Munsters or something.  Is it classical or, no, because you like classical, so that wouldn't, you wouldn't make fun of  that.  I'll tell you, I call it taking a peek. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  But him, I.  I don't know if you want to go away for classical.  So, that fine tuning that XM used to have was a really good station because they mixed  it nice, but a pure classical station, fuck no.  I'm going way off.  80s.  That's not way off.  No?  No.  That's, that's, that's, you're warm.  Is it close?  You're sort of warm.  70s?  No, no.  Does he like a little BTO?  Kenny has no clue as far as rock music goes.  No.  None.  No, why would he? 
[00:28:30]  None.  None whatsoever.  We should get Kenny in here to tell Anthony.  Anthony.  I like.  What?  And does Travis know?  The village people.  Travis can find.  Ah, ah, ah.  I'm going to write the.  Ah, yeah?  Ah.  I don't, I don't.  Gay, uh, pop music.  Mm.  Huh.  Interesting.  Is Kenny around?  Where is Kenny?  Go fetch something.  Let me lumber down the hallway in a lope.  He lopes.  Uh, Kevin, Kevin from Connecticut is correct. 
[00:29:00]  Kenny listens to Howard 101.  Ah.  Blue Heeler, Looney Tunes channel.  It's so weird.  I got in the car and he just screamed Baba Booey at me.  I was like, Kenny, that's uncalled for.  All right, Kenny.  We understand your love for the show, but Jesus.  Kenny's been, and by the way, we parked, we went to dinner, we parked under the Time Warner  building.  Kenny put his fucking brand new 2009 hunk of shit compared to everything else in that garage.  He parked his affordable SUV.  Affordable SUV? 
[00:29:30]  Hey, sensible car.  Jesus.  Drop us off.  Well, he wouldn't even splurge for a fucking touchscreen GPS because it was an extra thousand.  Oh, my God.  I go, Kenny, it's your, I even said, because people, I get a horrendous reputation on the  show, I understand, whatever, but I go, Kenny, your birthday's coming up.  I will buy you the GPS.  Just get it and tell me how much it is.  Put it in.  And then throw the handling charge in there and I'll give you a check.  And then he gets the sensible SUV and it's, it's old school.  I'm like, what's wrong with you?  I can put a Tom Tom on the windshield. 
[00:30:00]  I could get a portable for $200.  Oh, Kenny.  Every new car has an avenue.  So we pulled the SUV, the sensible SUV into the parking lot after Jim, Jimmy's big lemon  tape in.  And we pulled down the Time Warner building is a, a fucking, I mean, you know, there's  just $30 million apartments at the top of that.  It's a Taj Mahal building.  Yeah, huge.  We went into, the restaurants are very nice.  Underneath, uh, we saw two Rolls Royces. 
[00:30:30]  This is like, this is before you get to the security, there's a security guy, they check  under your car.  They don't want you to blow in that building.  There's obviously a lot of money in that building.  Oh yeah, they don't fuck around.  They mirror your car.  They mirror the car.  They mirror.  Wow.  And that's like a type of guys, like, you get guys there that like, like the guys who  have oil businesses that have a second home there, they're $30 million apartments.  It's fucking sickening.  Most of these people that have, yeah.  So it's all money.  They live somewhere else and they just kind of come to New York every once in a while  and check out their $30 million apartment.  So you park under there and there's two fucking Rolls Royces and you know that Mercedes, I 
[00:31:00]  didn't know, I forgot the name already.  The Mercedes Maybach.  Oh, it's a Maybach.  I didn't know it was a Mercedes.  I've never seen it, but it's the one that you have to, I think Trump has one.  It's like a $250,000 car.  You got to be chauffeured in it.  It's a, uh, it's what amounts to a jet.  If you, if you went on a custom jet that just drove on the street.  Yeah.  That's what this is.  It's a, the back seat, I think actually reclines.  It reclines to a bed.  There's TVs in there. 
[00:31:30]  It's all wood trimmed.  Uh oh, it looks like someone has been test driving.  Oh, I went to the car club.  Definitely.  I took a drive in one of those.  Oh, they got one?  Unbelievable.  It has like a first class airline seat in the back, I think.  And, uh, there were fucking three of them.  Three.  Three of them.  In sight, by the way.  Two of them next to each other.  I'm like, Jesus.  Because this garage goes down probably four levels.  The first level had three.  And you forgot about the Bentley.  No, I said two Rolls Royces.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Two Rolls's, three of those, and I didn't even know what else. 
[00:32:00]  Bitumen.  Bitumen.  It's off.  Yeah, it's off, uh, Danny.  Yeah, it's off, sir.  There we go.  Oh, let me see pictures of that.  I couldn't, we kept trying to look in the window like the white trash we are, and I couldn't  see because it was all blacked out.  Oh, were you, were you looking in the window with your hand over your eyes?  Yep.  Did you have your hand over your eyes, mucking up the windows with, with, with, with hand  grease?  Fucking car, Jesus.  Yes, first class, uh, airline seats.  But that's to be chauffeured in.  The back of the Maybach has champagne glass holders. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  TV's in the, uh, seats in front of you so you can watch that.  I'm buying one.  Leg room up the ass.  I'm buying one.  It, well, yeah, yeah.  Well, Trump is chauffeured all over.  That could be about, uh, five, six thousand dollars.  I ain't buying that shit.  How much are they?  They, they gotta go at least a quarter mil.  They're gorgeous, man.  Oh, oh.  At least.  And, uh, strangely enough, power up the ass.  The thing really moves.  For a 12-seller?  Yeah.  Huge.  I, uh, I had a great prank in process, in progress, excuse me, progress, and, uh, I, I 
[00:33:00]  couldn't, I couldn't pull it off because I don't know her well enough yet.  Oh, dude, you should have got her.  I had her so bad.  But this, this, this sensible, uh, SUV pulls up that looks like, uh, Kenny's sensible SUV.  Same car.  It was black, too, right?  So I go, oh, the car's here.  So Jimmy's girl starts walking toward the car.  Oh, no.  She literally had her handle on the, uh, on the, on the passenger side door as a guy 
[00:33:30]  was getting in.  She wasn't looking to see him as Kenny.  Oh, no.  And I'm like, I, I've only seen her a few times.  I can't do it.  So the last second I, I let her off the hook.  I'm like, she was this close to getting in this car.  Dude, and she got in and sat down and the guy was just like, ooh, Merry Christmas to me.  And then locked her in and drove one.  Yeah.  Prank gone wrong.  But I do, I'm like, dude, you should have, you should have absolutely let her get in  the car.  I couldn't, I just didn't know her well enough. 
[00:34:00]  Jimmy's ready to let the joke go the full distance, even though it's his own shit.  Dude, just let her get in the car would have been hilarious.  It really would have been fun.  I didn't know what to do.  How embarrassing is that?  You get in someone else's car?  Oh, I'm sorry.  What do you say?  My friends are assholes.  I would have made it much worse because I would have ran over.  I'm sorry.  She does this a lot.  She's just like, we're fighting and she wants to leave with someone else.  I apologize.  You would have, too.  Oh, without a doubt.  The car's 400,000, people are saying.  Wow.  Look at that thing.  Oh, wow.  It's also 150,000.  A lot of people are laughing at the fact we think it's a quarter mil. 
[00:34:30]  It's closer to 400.  Could be a quarter mil, perhaps.  A few people saying that.  Kenny, finally.  Thank you.  Step up to that microphone, my friend, and tell everybody your favorite or the channel  you had on when we got into your sensible.  Look at the smile on his face.  He's very proud.  First of all, why don't you have a GPS?  They didn't come with them?  No.  It's a whole thing.  Why?  It's a whole thing.  Why did you get it? 
[00:35:00]  Because the trucks either came fully loaded with everything, the DVD, the trailer package,  or nothing.  All you couldn't do is no in-between?  Right.  So you went with nothing.  The way the economy is.  What was the price difference for the fully loaded?  How much more would it have been?  Like six grand.  Oh, all right.  Okay.  What?  Wouldn't it have just been a grand more for the GPS?  No, they wanted two grand for the GPS system.  Okay.  That's a lot.  And then the trailer package and the DVD. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, that's a lot.  How much for the haircut?  Priceless.  $1.85.  He got a brand new haircut.  He sure did.  Okay.  That makes sense.  A lot of money.  I go to a nice, you know, the neighborhood.  The barber.  Yeah, the old Italian guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You get the shave and everything?  Yeah, with that thing.  With that thing.  It's called a razor.  I hear that shave is awesome.  Yeah.  I probably used to get those shaves.  Is it really?  I hear it's amazing.  But how long do they last?  It's like four hours later, you got stubble. 
[00:36:00]  It's the pampering crap.  Is that it?  They got the hot towels and everything.  I guess it's a thing.  I always think someone's going to come in there and say something in Italian and slice the throat.  Yeah.  Scary.  The Wall Street guys are big on that.  They go for lunch and do that crap.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  That's a bit of razor.  I got OnStar free for a year with turn-by-turn directions.  Oh, those are good.  Yeah, and the thing shows up on the radio.  Just like math.  Like the arrow, turn.  Great.  Is it true Alan Iverson has three maid box? 
[00:36:30]  He drives them all himself?  Wow, really?  Does he really drive himself?  Why would you drive it yourself?  It's made to be driven by somebody and you sit in the back.  Yeah.  Why would you?  Well...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Put the cap on.  Put the cap on.  Bring it around.  I'm sure it's a nice car to drive, but Iverson's got basketball money.  When you have athlete money...  Yeah.  You know, what's he make?  15 million a year?  80 million?  Who the fuck...  How much does he make a year? 
[00:37:00]  He's getting close to the end of his career, my friend.  Yeah, but he's made...  Alan Iverson.  For sneakers alone, he's probably worth it a fucking...  Yeah, he's an animal.  By the way, the Lakers are moving on, speaking of basketball, but...  Nice talking to you.  No, what channel did you...  What channel did you have on?  Yeah, which channel?  It's the best disco around.  Oh, no.  Classical dance music, Channel 83, The Strobe.  He doesn't.  I swear to God.  No, he doesn't.  We got into the car, Jimmy and I.  With Joe Causey. 
[00:37:30]  You even know the guy's name?  Yeah, he's a legend, Joe Causey.  What a disgrace you are.  Oh, my God.  Did anyone...  Is this some of it?  Did anyone guess The Strobe?  It's...  Oh, is this it?  Like, you hear stuff like this?  Let's Dance, The Last Dance.  Great to hear him, Boogie Nights.  Let's Dance, The Last Dance, The Last Dance.  Yeah?  Down the summer?  Wow.  Get into it.  No.  Shouldn't William Macy be killing himself to the sun? 
[00:38:00]  You like this stuff?  Yeah.  But we didn't hear this, Kenny.  We heard this...  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  That is down the summer.  Now Casey and the Sunshine Band.  Get down tonight.  Get down.  Get...  Yeah?  You like that?  Yeah, I had it on for...  I programmed, like, every channel.  I got the Boneyard for Jimmy.  Of course.  My favorite fucking station.  This one included is the Boneyard.  I love the fucking XM Boneyard. 
[00:38:30]  Best station on the platform.  Do you program the stations, though, for who's going to be in the car?  It's very courteous.  What do you got for GH?  I've got the New Wave Rock.  I'm not a New Wave Rock.  All Rock?  Yeah, I got...  I did it all.  I got six pages of favorites.  Yeah, he...  If I got in your vehicle, what would you put on?  What do you think I would appreciate?  Ah, that's a good question.  Seriously, Sinatra.  No, you wouldn't.  Why would I listen to that?  Because you're Italian.  Dago.  The sounds of the... 
[00:39:00]  It'd be the fucking...  The Blitzkrieg with music behind it.  That would be like...  Nice German march.  Funeral dirt.  I want some Beer Hall friggin' sling your stein back in for the chance.  What other channels you got programmed and why?  I got the, like, the Hits channel, like, 20, 22, 30.  For the broads, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not broads for you, but, you know, but for, like...  You know what, I want to roll down the window and turn it up and play it loud and impress somebody. 
[00:39:30]  What else?  Nah, like, I got them all.  Like, all the rock and roll.  I even got 67 from my Nubian brothers.  Oh, what is that one called?  Some hip-hop nation.  Some hip-hop nation?  You do not have hip-hop in there.  Yeah.  Why?  Because I relate to those people.  Keep tabs?  It brings me back to my roots, yeah.  Yeah, it brings you back to your roots, all right?  Swinging a phone book in a dark room. 
[00:40:00]  He knows what they're really singing about, right, K?  Yeah.  It's not a pop song, is it?  Penny likes hip-hop.  Does he?  Yes.  The guy used to listen to hip-hop a lot.  He actually likes hip-hop.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you've never been to the ghetto, don't come to the ghetto, because you can't relate to the ghetto.  What an ass.  He rules.  We enjoyed your sensible SUV yesterday.  No, thank you.  It's a nice car.  Just don't have to drive me to that garage with it again. 
[00:40:30]  Rent something else before you take me around three Mercedes Maybachs and two fucking Rolzes.  And Bentleys.  I know.  And that was only like five cars in.  Who knows what else is in that garage that they're hiding down below.  In the bowels.  That they don't want anyone to see.  Ferraris.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, good news.  The Strobe is playing Rick James.  Give it to me, baby, right now.  All right, Rick James.  Maybe we can get you a little guest DJing on the Strobe.  Oh, imagine how great that would be, Kenny DJing.  Would you do that? 
[00:41:00]  I can't hit the post.  We can try.  You should hit an apartment in your new car.  Why don't we try one, Kenny?  What song do you like?  I can wing it.  I'm a pro.  We don't know these classic disco songs.  You just surprise me.  I'll do it.  All right.  We got Travis.  He'll do a good job.  As soon as you hear that music, you go.  All right.  You go, boy.  Wait, is Leno out of the hospital or he just left? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, he's good.  He starts back up Friday, I think.  He's taking the whole fucking week?  I don't know.  What, has he got that swine flu?  Did he get the swine flu?  Jay never takes off.  Oh, no.  He got a lot of swine flu in California.  I'm sorry.  He returned last night.  It's a new story.  One of his classic cars broke down on the road.  Oh, all right.  They showed a clip of him on the motorcycle or something.  The guy's got the dumbest vehicles.  Oh, by the way, I taped for Friday.  You know who was on Monday's episode who taped earlier?  Who?  Matthew Fox from Lost. 
[00:42:00]  No.  I know.  Not that I was crying about Kiefer, but Matthew Fox, I would have.  Kiefer is a big lead-in, man.  Better than Kiefer.  Huh?  Better than Kiefer right now.  Oh, for me, it would have been.  Don't shake your head, Travis, you homosexual in love with Kiefer.  Kiefer's a bigger name than Matthew Fox because he's a movie star.  Not right now.  Yeah, he's a movie star, too.  Not right now.  Let me tell you, he's a slight little man.  I don't know how he's saving the world.  He's not much bigger than Travis.  No, he's very, very slim. 
[00:42:30]  He knocked down a Christmas tree, drunk off his ass, though, in a lobby.  Did he?  Oh, he did.  There's a video of it.  What a good boy.  He throws himself sideways.  He does a cross-body block into a Christmas tree, drunk off his ass, and gets arrested.  What a nice man he is, too.  He was so nice.  Was he?  Yeah, I got Travis' signed 24 movie because he's like a big fucking fan.  Wow, that's nice.  How was the Travis blowjob for that?  Good?  It was fine.  Travis gave me one anyway.  Oh, this is him doing the drunk thing? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, this is him drunk.  That's just in a hotel lobby.  How do you not love that guy?  He jumps into a Christmas tree for no reason.  They arrested him?  Oh, sure.  Why wouldn't you?  Who would you live?  Drunk friends.  Why would you do that?  Why not?  That rules.  All right, let's get to it.  That video's showing for the rest of your life.  Kenny, do you have a radio name?  Yeah, Dodo Bird.  All right, Dodo Bird. 
[00:43:30]  You ready to do this?  Is Travis ready for a Dodo Bird?  Here's Dodo Bird talking up some records for everybody.  So, hit hit.  Good morning, party people.  Let's start the day with a nice dance vibe.  Coming up on your radio dial now, it's give it to me, baby.  So, give it to me, baby.  Let's go.  Give it to me, baby.  Good morning, party people.  What?  I'm the Dodo Bird. 
[00:44:00]  I'm the Dodo Bird.  Oh, he just missed the post.  That would have been good.  Wow, he was doing good, but he kept a little repeating of things.  Yeah, you got to tell everyone who you are.  Tell them who you are.  Tell them what you're doing.  Maybe weather, a quick weather thing.  A humorous anecdote.  There's a big intro there.  You got a lot of time.  Well, maybe just bring people back to the time.  Yeah, more about the music.  Yeah, but you got it.  You got it.  That's just it.  You could be all about the music, but to be a pro jock. 
[00:44:30]  If they want the weather, let them look out the window.  When you could say that.  Yes.  There you go.  All right.  Let's try another one.  If Travis has one queued up.  Of course he does.  He's Travis.  Oh, maybe not.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  The system's freezing.  He said that in my headphone.  I'm hearing things.  Anyone have an iPod?  We could just put the speaker up to the mic. 
[00:45:00]  Why is it taking so long to get a horrid disco song?  That rules.  What?  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  It's just one of the best software.  You know, they're from the 70s.  It takes a while.  Oh, you got to go back.  Oh, I got all the Decades channel, too.  How did I forget that?  50s?  60s?  70s?  No, no, no.  Not 50s.  I got 90, 80, 70s.  Oh, the 60s are pretty good.  You don't even got 60s?  You don't want to hear a little Mamas and the Papas?  A little doo-wop is 50s. 
[00:45:30]  60s is more like Woodstock.  Some cream?  Cream in my pants.  All right, we got another song for them?  All right, here we go.  The Dodo Bird.  Good morning, people.  This is the Dodo Bird.  Coming up on your radio now, a beautiful little song from the Bee Gees.  You love John Travolta in this movie.  Screw the weather.  Screw going to work.  Just turn it up and listen. 
[00:46:00]  Oh!  Yeah!  Nice!  Thank you.  Thank you.  Not bad.  One more?  And then we'll rest this?  No, I leave on a good note.  You happy?  Now you're a cunt.  He touched my hair.  I don't like when he touches my hair.  Cigarette?  Annette?  I'm bored with it, all right?  I'm bored with it. 
[00:46:30]  Hey, Double J.  Kevin from Connecticut is calling you Cousin Douchey.  Cousin Douchey.  Well, let me say hi to Tony in the Bronx, I think.  The Bronx.  Tony!  Thank you, Kenny.  I love the straw, brother.  It's good.  A little job talking by the Bee Gees right now.  I love it.  Thank you, brother.  Thank you. 
[00:47:00]  You see, I'm not alone.  Sending it out to him.  Yeah.  It's nice.  Yeah, have a nice day.  Have a nice day.  You listen to that, though, like casually, on the way home, alone, in your vehicle?  Yeah, I listen.  Yeah.  Just wondering.  Everybody's got their guilty pleasure.  Yeah, guilty pleasure is once in a while.  Like, that's what you listen to.  Kenny's a weirdo.  Like, a guilty pleasure is you listen to maybe, I don't know, lithium, alt-nation. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, not for guilty pleasure?  No, no, no, no.  I mean, you listen to that, and then as a guilty pleasure, you go to some weird channel, and  you hear something and that.  But you listen to that all the time.  Well, not all the time.  I switch it up.  What else?  I got the Decade channels.  So why?  You like Peter Frampton?  I got 1010 wins news so I can be informed.  That's really weird.  I get in his car in the morning, 1010 wins is at a whisper. 
[00:48:00]  What are you doing?  You give me 20 minutes, I'll give you the world.  It's a radio bump.  How about this?  Ah, Jimmy!  Ah!  That's what I do when wins goes on in the shower.  You did it!  Jimmy!  Kenny's slug line would be, you give me 30 seconds, and I'll give you a reason to kill  yourself.  Why did you tell Jimmy that it wasn't a little stuffy?  Oh, it was the worst. 
[00:48:30]  First of all, I'm in that dressing room.  It's a good thing you didn't come down, because they had all the band people in there.  Oh, oh.  You know, they're not paying attention.  I'm trying to watch the TV and listen, and, you know, I was misinformed.  Oh, why wouldn't they?  Why wouldn't they pay attention?  They don't pay attention.  They're getting ready to go out.  They're too big.  I don't blame them.  Oh, they think they're too big.  No, they're nervous.  They're probably nervous.  I don't blame them.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  We were in the dressing room.  I wanted to shush them.  They're going, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, they were warming up?  Yeah.  Well, you can't shush the other guests.  That's different when they're warming up.  Maybe they've got to do that the same.  Yeah, this is Letterman, not a fucking traveling virus gig.  It's not Caliendo in the other room.  It's one of our fucking, or Otto.  I think we were worrying Jimmy because I'm like, Kenny, go shush him.  Go, go, go.  And then I go, Kenny, just join in with the la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la.  I would be the baritone.  You certainly would.  Let's hear a little baritone. 
[00:49:30]  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, you're like Bowser.  All right, get out of here.  Go find it.  Get out of here.  Go fetch something.  Thank you.  You're like, okay, thank you, Kenny.  It's just get out of here.  Just get the fuck out of here.  We're going to take a break, I think.  We've got Bill Burr coming in all week.  We do.  When Bill Burr comes to New York, we give him an open door.  Also, a very funny guy, Al Jackson, is coming in to say hi.  First appearance on our show.  And Maury Povich.  Yep. 
[00:50:00]  Maury's coming in?  Maury.  Maury.  Gee, do we have any pregnant women who want to know who their baby belongs to?  How about we tell Maury to stay home, we go home early, and we replay the Maury appearance  from last time, because it'll be the exact same interview.  Could do that.  Could do that.  Oh, and let's talk about the air scare next.  Oh, yeah, that was a biggie.  Bunch of dummies.  Photo op.  How about you tell some people what you're up to?  We're a little skittish in this city.  You know what, though?  One glance.  Well, we'll talk about it. 
[00:50:30]  We'll talk about it?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if it should.  I don't quite agree.  And we haven't talked about the videos in a while.  It'll be up to Jimmy.  Oh, no.  The mime video is up.  Oh, no, I haven't seen it.  No.  No.  The mime video is up.  I don't want to look.  I don't want to see.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You like the Jimmy?  No.  What's not to like?  Ant in a box miming?  You?  That fucking, fucking do? 
[00:51:00]  What's not to like?  Magic.  No, please.  Oh, this is awful.  You want to watch it for everybody next?  It's a mere 40 seconds.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  That's all it was?  40 seconds of pain.  It's all.  It's like a six-hour miniseries.  Every moment.  What was your favorite part, Jimmy?  When it just stopped because it was over.  It's like when you ask them, what was your favorite part of being raped with a fucking  cheerleading baton at the end of it? 
[00:51:30]  I look forward to it.  All right.  We'll do that next, possibly.  There's some good news, too.  Oh, we got a nice story coming out of Rochester, too.  Gotcha.  Some reporter goes to Popeye's.  Oh, I heard about this one, yeah.  Wow, that is close.  What happened?  Oh, thank you.  Are people crazy?  We'll talk about the air scare next.  Oh, Christ.  They're just stupid.  Hey, Mother's Day right around the corner. 
[00:52:00]  Know what I'm doing for my mom this Mother's Day, yeah?  What, Opie?  I think I'm going to talk to her for the first time in four months.  Jesus Christ.  I was thinking maybe it's time to talk to her.  All right, Eddie.  Didn't expect that one to come.  And then I might also get her some flowers from Pro Flowers.  Ah, see?  Okay, that's better.  ProFlowers.com.  Not a bit.  We've used...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We've used Pro Flowers before for the girls. 
[00:52:30]  The mamas.  The moms.  And they're beautiful.  They're great.  They last a long time.  You'd think you're walking in and go, the flowers, they're dead.  But they're not.  No.  They last a long time.  They gave us flowers, I don't even know, I think close to two weeks ago.  And they're still amazing.  They're still alive.  They're still alive.  Yeah.  Amazing.  And what a great offer they got for our listeners for Mommy's Day.  Mm-hmm.  It's 100 Colorful Blooms for Moms.  What is that about? 
[00:53:00]  A Pro Flowers bestseller for only $19.99.  What the heck?  I'm beside myself.  Am I reading this right?  100 Colorful Blooms?  You get the free glass vase.  Huge bouquet.  Huge savings.  Great deal for you and mom.  Amazing.  Special.  It's only available until Friday.  Don't wait another day. 
[00:53:30]  To get your 100 Blooms for $19.99, here's what you do.  Go to ProFlowers.com.  That's the website.  I'm there right now.  What do I do?  What do I do?  Now, see the microphone in the upper right-hand corner?  It's in the upper right-hand corner.  Oh, my God.  Click it.  Click it.  All right.  I clicked it.  Now you enter the password Opie.  O-P-I-E.  Oh, is that how you spell that?  Yes.  Don't put Greggs.  Put Opie.  I've been spelling it O-P-E-Y all these years. 
[00:54:00]  No.  It's Opie.  Yeah, people do that.  O-P-I-E is Opie.  All right.  Or, for those of you computer-impaired, call 800-PRO-Flowers.  Time out.  Yes?  No one makes phone calls anymore.  Can I text it?  Well, no.  I don't see a text thing here.  Can I BBM it?  No.  I don't see that either.  I just see a phone number.  800-PRO-Flowers.  Pro-Flowers.  And then when someone answers, you mention Opie. 
[00:54:30]  You just go, psst.  Hey, Opie.  And then you get that great deal.  100 colorful blooms.  I'm thinking that's a typo, but it's not.  Oh, you're doing it?  You're calling?  Mm-hmm.  Right now.  Can't be complete as dialed.  All right.  Look, that's probably not a good thing to do.  You must have missed dialed.  Well.  Because if you call 1-800-PRO-Flowers.  See, I told you.  I don't know how to make phone calls anymore. 
[00:55:00]  This is real.  Yeah.  1-800-3-plus-6-plus.  See, that's not.  I swear to God.  That's not 1-800-PRO-Flowers.  What did I do wrong?  You're putting in one of Jimmy's math formulas.  See, I don't know how to dial a phone anymore.  For real.  That's a count sign hatch.  For real.  There was a couple plus signs on my number instead of this.  Plus signs are not numbers.  Is that because I did an alt?  Yeah.  You must have screwed that up somehow.  I'll try it again later.  1-800-PRO-Flowers.  Mention Opie. 
[00:55:30]  You get the special deal.  It's great for Mother's Day.  ProFlowers.com.  Checking out the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes, you are.  A lot more people walking the hallways today.  Yesterday was just like a ghost town.  A-na-na-na-na-na, ghost town.  Anyone?  You know that song?  That's all I know.  Ghost town.  What's your favorite song out there right now? 
[00:56:00]  Right now?  Mm-hmm.  Ah, not into any of the newer songs,  which makes me sound like a fucking fart.  Not really.  But, um, I don't know.  I'm just listening to lithium.  Yeah.  I like the lithium.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, lithium.  Bill Burr will be here at 8.30.  Al Jackson at 8.  You don't know Al Jackson yet, probably.  A lot of people will see me with him.  Yeah, he warmed up for my HBO special. 
[00:56:30]  He's a black comic.  A lot of guys have seen him on the road with me.  Why can't you just say he's a comic?  Because I've used so many different comedian friends with me  that Al's a black comedian,  and a lot of times, let's be honest,  these drunk animals will go,  who is the black dude?  So now they know it's Al, but they love him.  Al killed in front of the O.P. Anthony audience.  He's got...  I know a lot of comedians have their standard penis joke.  Yeah.  Al Jackson's standard penis joke 
[00:57:00]  is probably the best one I've ever heard.  I'll tell you that much.  I don't know if you want to do the line.  Maybe we'll talk him into doing the line.  It's so fucking obnoxious.  By the way, if you ask him to do material  and he lapses into it,  I'm throwing fucking hot coffee on him.  No, not even...  I know.  That's a test.  It'll be on a...  We're discussing it level.  Not okay!  We should be all zoo...  Let's be all zoo crew-ish when he comes in  and play, like, beat the horn and shit.  Oh, let's get him all confused.  Hey, everybody!  Dude, let's be fucking zoo crew-hacks 
[00:57:30]  when he gets here.  Oh, he won't know what to do.  No, he'll be totally uncomfortable.  Al, what do you got?  There's the...  Al, he had the flyover  from the president's plane.  Go!  Let's do that.  Let's put him on a smoke.  Okay.  Let's be dick for it.  Let's just fuck him up.  Has he ever been on a plane?  Al, yeah.  You said he'd get you  into the plane material.  And he's black,  so he doesn't have satellite radio,  so he's not listening right now.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Al's a big satellite fan.  I don't know what that means.  What?  Easy.  What? 
[00:58:00]  I'll be the hole.  Easy.  I want to see this video.  No, you can't.  Oh, my God.  I forgot about it.  I already saw it.  I want to see it.  I didn't see it.  Oh, you should.  It's good.  I have not seen it.  You're actually very funny in it.  Shut it.  It actually looks like  you're really trying to get out of there.  All right, well...  Clam up.  We should ask...  Sam, remind me of another one  that's coming soon.  Oh, which one?  Oh, Hopi.  Me as the skateboarder.  Do you remember that one, Al?  Oh, God, yes.  Okay, good.  That one is really bad.  Maybe Sam could come in and... 
[00:58:30]  Oh, that's douchey.  That one I remember doing.  Yeah, I remember that one, too.  Sam's already running down the hall.  You want to watch this video first?  Look at his feet.  Look at his feet.  I'm running toward the studio.  Look at me.  All right.  Fucking Ronald McDonald's feet.  With his stupid Afro ponytail.  Worse than mine was  in any of these videos.  Sam, you're going to regret  that hair in 11 years.  Why?  Yep.  Because there's going to be video...  Because Sam could regret his ponytail.  It's going to be video of you  and you're going to go, 
[00:59:00]  Why did I do that for so long?  Why did I just cut my fucking hair?  My mom said I look like Shawn Michaels.  Boo!  Oh, all right.  The Shawn Michaels.  The heartbreak kid himself.  Ah.  Did she look at your arms?  No, I think she just met the face.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh. 
[00:59:30]  When she said when I pull my hair back.  How does she know who Shawn Michaels is?  Because she was privy to some wrestling during my childhood.  She had to raise a wrestling geek.  Well, fan.  Fan, sorry.  How embarrassing is that for a parent?  Sam, before we play the mime video that's up right now  on the YouTube account, Opie Radio,  what can you tell Jimmy that is coming in the very near future?  Maybe today even.  Oh, coming up?  Well...  Are we going to do skateboarding?  I was about to say. 
[01:00:00]  That was one that I saw over the weekend that I really enjoyed.  It was good, huh?  Why did you enjoy it?  Well, because of the setup.  What's the setup?  Because you're on top of a half pipe.  That's right.  Getting ready to skateboard.  That's right.  I did some skateboarding back in the day.  And Ant goes,  No!  You can't do it.  You don't know how to skateboard.  Oh, no, I don't.  Yeah.  Please tell me I don't do that.  Can I say there's nothing better than Ant acting?  Yeah.  It is great. 
[01:00:30]  I know.  It is tremendous.  And Opie goes,  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  And Ant tries to discourage him.  Did I do it, Sam, or what?  Yeah.  Yeah, Opie does it and they go to a long shot.  And it's incredible because it's obviously somebody with blonde hair skateboarding.  It's got to be Opie.  Thank you.  We're on the same jacket, I think.  Yeah.  Right?  And then at the very end, it gets back.  He's tearing up the half pipe.  He was destroying it.  I was getting some good hair, right?  Yeah.  I was very impressed.  I had no idea.  You were doing some flippy flip moves? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's what I used to call them when I was skateboarding, flippy flip moves.  I don't think anyone called them flippy flip moves.  Just little flippy flips.  And at the very end, it finally goes back to the tight shot once you're done skateboarding.  And you just see, oh, you fell off of the skateboard at the very bottom.  But after all that, it didn't matter.  At that point, he had proved himself.  But then I watched the whole episode from opening credits to closing credits.  And there's something that, for those who really pay attention to Real Rock TV, the editors added a little something in the credits for us. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, really?  It says something to the effect of, WAAF released a press release stating that Opie would only use his superhuman skateboarding abilities for the powers of good.  Then, skip a couple lines.  Then, and for picking up chicks.  Wow. 
[01:02:00]  I didn't write that.  How cool is that?  Could you repeat that?  Look, I didn't write that, Jimmy.  Well, it starts off by saying WAAF released a press release.  I didn't write that.  That said Opie.  Anthony didn't write that.  Opie would only use his superhuman.  That was stupid Ian Barrett.  His superhuman skateboarding powers for good.  And then you skip a couple lines.  And then it says, and for picking up chicks.  And let me guess, was there an exclamation point after chicks?  I think so.  Oh, picking up chicks. 
[01:02:30]  And for picking up chicks.  Yeah.  That's right.  Well, did you notice that I could barely stand on the skateboard?  After Ant said, you could barely stand on that thing.  I did, right?  See, so that was good that I said that.  It was like intern David back there.  Oh, no.  He's going to fall.  Oh, no.  I can't believe it.  That's skateboard.  What other videos?  Anything else you see?  Oh, no.  We still got to do the IRS one. 
[01:03:00]  I haven't seen the IRS one yet.  No, you wouldn't meet Rocco outside the post office.  Oh, that's right.  I didn't post that, did I?  We haven't posted that.  Oh, that's a gem.  Anything with Rocco as well.  Yes.  Yeah.  Gem.  And I was watching, I watched your interview with Billy Idol.  That one was fine.  But just because it ends, it ends with you saying, so what's the deal?  You got some shows playing, man.  No.  Please tell me he doesn't do that.  How does he say the man?  Are you exaggerating?  No.  He goes, so what's the deal? 
[01:03:30]  You got some shows playing, man.  Why?  He was with the man.  What's the man?  Why, man?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There it is.  Yeah.  Why are you Swedish?  Why are you Swedish?  I don't know.  I don't like.  Look.  Oh, that isn't good.  Look.  When they show the Southern State Parkway with a motorcycle laying in the middle of it,  and they're rolling out a measuring tape measure. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, are they?  To see how long the skid mark was.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's what it is.  Oh, boy.  That guy.  Ew.  That guy.  Oh, is that the guy?  Is that the guy right over there?  Right on TV?  Might be.  I think that's before the blanket got there.  No.  They wouldn't show dead guy on TV, would they?  From a distance.  It's one of them green rice burners.  It's always a sport bike.  I never see cruisers laying in the middle of it.  No.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Those guys are insane. 
[01:04:30]  You know who are really crazy on motorcycles?  Black guys on bikes.  Oh.  Drive like maniacs.  They're insane?  Yeah.  Like rice burns.  Everybody, for some reason, they all think they're Evel Knievel when they get on a motorcycle  for some reason.  I mean, why in the world do you want to pass in the middle of two cars doing 80 and you  want to pass in the middle doing 110?  Yeah.  I have no desire to do that.  Like, I don't know why you would want to do that.  It's ridiculous.  You would just sit and wait.  Yeah.  I sit in traffic.  I don't lane split because it's probably the most dangerous thing you could possibly 
[01:05:00]  do.  It really is.  Why would you do that?  Because it pisses off the people in the cars and they're going to, like, move over slightly.  And it's legal.  Giving you less room to, you know, get by.  It is.  Is it?  You could take a bike between cars on the dotted white line.  Really?  Yeah.  Where'd you hear that?  It's legal.  I don't know if that's the one.  I think that's a hunk of bunk.  If it is, it's definitely not a good idea.  Definitely not recommended by anybody.  It was legal back in, like, 1977.  Welcome to fucking...  Back when you were able to lay on the back of the deck of the car. 
[01:05:30]  The deck of the rear window.  Welcome to old lady radio.  And he didn't have a helmet?  And he was doing what?  A bunch of chest.  You could smoke a cigar in the supermarket.  You could smoke on an airplane.  I love those old videos.  The doctor's doing surgery.  You see an ash hanging over the guy's fucking chest wound.  We found out what it was.  It was a Tarrytown cigarette butt.  Tarrytown.  What are they called? 
[01:06:00]  I'm tired.  Tarrytown.  Tarrytown.  I live in Tarrytown.  Isn't that where Santa lives or something?  I just moved from Salem.  Fucking Tarrytown.  Oh, smoke me.  Tarrytown.  They always had time to smoke.  When we were growing up, they always had time to smoke.  Oh, yeah.  Nothing stopped the smoking thing.  Hell no.  Hey, Sam, so we got, what were you getting at?  Dumb.  Did you see any other Real Rock TV shows? 
[01:06:30]  No, we had the tax thing.  We got the skateboarding thing.  The skateboarding thing.  Might be the next one going up.  But I mean, keep in mind, just because I'm not listing, I still have at least six to seven  full episodes that I haven't even looked at.  The Tickle Me Elmo is the one that closes this whole segment.  That's a biggie.  Yeah.  Whatever that is.  Yeah, that's a good one.  We still haven't found that.  I'm burying for it.  All right.  Well, why don't we, oh, I was going to explain why the man and the yacht and the dude and  the long hair.  Something must happen to a man. 
[01:07:00]  Ann and I were working for a radio station where their main demo was 12 to 24-year-old  males.  Safe to say we were a bit older than that.  So we were attempting to do everything in our powers to look and sound younger than we  were.  They actually told us to do that, too.  Yeah.  Management said you shouldn't come across.  It's like, you're not married.  Yeah.  Hope you're not in a relationship.  Don't talk about wives or girlfriends.  We want these guys to think you're banging everybody. 
[01:07:30]  You're young guys.  So I think that...  Don't mention your age.  Don't mention girlfriends or wives.  And just talk about, like, that you're hanging, man.  And you're like the demo.  You're drinking.  You're hanging with everybody.  Okay.  Skateboarding.  Yeah.  Skateboarding.  Miming.  Trying to be mimes.  Miming.  I got two herniated discs.  I think I finally figured out when that officially happened. 
[01:08:00]  I think it's this video.  When you were skateboarding?  Oh, dude.  I fucked up my back.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah.  Is there a video we should be watching today?  Okay.  Let's go, Jim.  Oh, boy.  It's actually not bad.  So this is the official mime video.  I can't watch.  I have to cover my face.  Not to be confused with all the other mime videos that we did.  Poor Anthony.  I have to cover my face.  Hey, it's WAF's Opie and Anthony.  Welcome to another WAF Real Rock TV show.  You might be wondering what Anthony's doing in the box.  Well, he's practicing to be a mime. 
[01:08:30]  How's it going in there, Ant?  Pretty good.  They say I'm doing it so I can lose the box.  Right on.  Well, you keep practicing, all right?  We got a great show tonight.  We got a couple live performances that you're going to love.  We got Deshwala.  Also, Tree from the WAF Studios.  Plus, Ozone has a really cool interview with the Black Crows.  And we go behind the scenes at Comics Come Home.  It's all on WAF Real Rocks TV.  What?  Real Rocks.  I can't breathe.  Don't worry.  Keep practicing, man.  Let's check out the show, huh?  I don't like the way he... 
[01:09:00]  Oh, and I passed out.  Yeah, because he couldn't breathe.  Yeah.  Did we go back to him and see if he was all right?  Because...  Um, no.  Hope so.  Not later in the show.  I hope so.  Not that I saw.  I had no oxygen in there.  I have a couple points.  Yeah.  One is you say we got a great show.  Uh-huh.  And then nothing you say afterwards indicates the aforementioned promise.  What about Deshwala?  Exactly.  Deshwala.  How about Deshpit?  Fucking Deshwala.  Oh, I never heard of him before.  Give me a little Blue Cars, Travis. 
[01:09:30]  Deshwala can eat my ball bag.  Travis knows the Deshwala thing.  Oh, of course.  Their big hit.  Blue Cars was like a massive hit.  Interview with them.  One of their numerous hits.  Oh, yeah.  Ozone.  Interview with that fucking boring Black Crows who gives a shit.  One of my favorite bands in the last 20 years.  I'd rather hear a fucking toenail interview than the Black Crows.  Ah, there we go.  Here's a...  This is Deshwala.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, an interview with Deshwala coming up.  Never heard of it.  And I think they performed this song live on our show.  Wow, really?  I don't know.  Why don't we get that?  I really don't know.  See? 
[01:10:00]  Who the fuck would talk to these?  This is terrible.  And then we talked to them about, you know, this song.  Do they like being on Real Rocks TV?  Yeah.  Real Rocks TV was the best.  Why couldn't we do a take two?  Because Anthony passed out.  Yeah.  It wouldn't hurt anyone to try it again.  The song implies God is a woman, man.  That's like so, like, cutting edge, man.  Yeah.  He said... 
[01:10:30]  Damn.  Hey.  Oh, Kevin from Connecticut knows Deshwala.  Deshwala, the follow-up hit was Charlie Brown's Parents.  I remember that one.  And it went nowhere.  It was a stinker.  Let's hear some Charlie Brown's...  It's not even in the last...  No.  It's not even in the last...  Deshwala thought with this blue car they were going to be the next Beatles.  Every band thinks when they got that big, huge hit, they're going to be the next Beatles, 
[01:11:00]  and then it never happens.  That right hip is popping out like mad.  Boing.  I touched that.  Did you suckle on that?  I have it on YouTube if you want to hit it.  I bit it.  You bit it?  I bit it.  Something tells me Ant's a fucking complete piece of shit in bed.  In bed?  Everywhere.  All that rage comes out.  You know, Rachel Epideth's in a girl's face.  She's like, but I'm none of those things.  Doesn't matter.  I know, but they cut me off. 
[01:11:30]  And it comes.  You're pissing off all the Black Crows fans.  Do you have a comment?  No, I was saying, who the fuck wants to hear them interviewed?  Actually, Chris Robinson's a good interview.  I'm sure he is.  Look at him making it real.  Just have fun with it.  I'm sorry.  It's not me making it real.  We had him on already.  He was okay.  He wouldn't talk about Kate Hudson's taint, which is all I wanted to fucking hear about.  Couldn't ask him anything about her.  Give her a stick and a duke her.  It's your turn.  What do you do to blow that relationship, man? 
[01:12:00]  I don't know.  Maybe she started fucking looking at Owen Wilson's awful fucking comb over.  That shitty Charlie from fucking Lost comb forward.  Comb forward.  Comb forward annoys the shit out of me.  And his bunghole mouth.  He makes bunghole mouth.  Hands on his hips.  Well, you know, it's...  Bunghole mouth.  The fact that the country finds him charming, we should all just be fucking fucked.  Flushed on the toilet.  If you purse your lips, you can be charming. 
[01:12:30]  And by the way, at the end of this video, I want to see this video again because there  was something that you guys missed.  It was after you go, like, you intro the show, your mouth stays open too long.  And yet, I haven't mentioned the Mr. Microphones.  We couldn't get nicer microphones.  No, it wasn't that long ago.  That is a bad microphone.  Horrible.  Where was this done?  I don't even know.  Mime school.  Mime school.  Watch at the end because let's check out the show. 
[01:13:00]  And the mouth just stays open.  What?  Real Rocks TV.  I can't breathe.  Don't worry.  Keep practicing, man.  Let's check out the show, huh?  Ha.  Yeah, you go.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  And your mouth stays open.  I want to hear Real Rocks TV.  Why Real Rocks TV?  How's it going in there, Ant?  Pretty good.  They say in two weeks, I can lose the box.  Right on.  Well, you keep practicing, all right?  We got a great show tonight.  We got a couple live performances that you're going to love.  We got the Shwala.  Also, Tree from the WAF Studios. 
[01:13:30]  Plus, Ozone has a really cool interview with the Black Crows.  And we go behind the scenes at Comics Come Home.  It's all on WAF Real Rocks TV.  What?  I can't breathe.  Don't worry.  Keep practicing, man.  Let's check out the show, huh?  Huh?  The mouth is open.  Ugh.  I don't know why.  That's fantastic.  Instinct is to close it.  Because I want to cock in there.  You want to cock, right? 
[01:14:00]  No, it looked like you were just hoping someone would love a grape in.  Fucking asshole.  Or a raisin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, why are we passing up the fact that we had Tree in studio?  I know.  That's pretty huge.  What's my Tree fans out there?  Pretty huge.  Will Dollar Bill anyone?  Don't know it.  Travis is-  I know that first song-  Is Travis giving me the thumbs up on Dollar Bill or no?  It's not in the last.  He says they have Cemetery.  Fuck Cemetery.  Dollar Bill-  Let me hear a song.  I don't know who Tree is.  He used to hang with Kurt.  As you can tell. 
[01:14:30]  Kurt probably couldn't-  This sounds like the Real Rock TV song.  Oh, this is a Dollar Bill.  It's not bad, though.  Who's this?  Mark Lanigan?  Something like that, right?  This guy gets nothing but respect.  Yeah, this is good.  In the grunge community, especially.  Really?  One of the OGs of grunge?  Nothing but respect. 
[01:15:00]  Most of the guys think he was the best singer of all of them.  He just never had any commercial success, really.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Tree, they're called?  It's good.  No, I'm not-  You know something?  Kurt's like-  Blows this voice away.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What's the matter?  There's a band called Tree.  Oh.  What?  I've been talking about Screaming Trees for the last five minutes. 
[01:15:30]  Wait.  Who is this guy?  I'm sitting there like, Tree.  I'm thinking, oh, that's how we used to say Screaming Trees, man.  That was Tree.  We just shortened it to Tree.  That was Tree.  That was pretty good.  No, that's Screaming Trees.  What we just listened to.  What we just listened to was Tree.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What?  Now I have Screaming Trees.  Wait a minute.  Let me hear Screaming Trees.  Wait, we don't care about Tree.  Wait a minute.  We always care about Screaming Trees.  Travis, you knew of a band called Tree?  No. 
[01:16:00]  Dilette knew of a band called Tree that had one song.  That scares the fuck out of me.  The whole time, I think we must have just called them Tree instead of Screaming Trees.  Because that guy's voice sucked.  That guy's very nothing.  It was okay, though.  I was enjoying the beat.  Yeah, but it was like nothing.  Do you remember the band Tree when we used to be up there?  No.  I have no fucking idea.  What was their big hit?  Travis Cemetery?  That was his.  I had never heard of him until now.  I remember Screaming Trees.  Yeah, Screaming Trees.  You want a dollar bill?  Yeah, a dollar bill.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear that one.  Sorry, Coke Logic. 
[01:16:30]  This guy's voice rules.  Everything's so grungy.  Yeah.  I said cheer up.  Everything from then is so grungy.  Chip her up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I rolled it up and stuck it between her tits.  Like an old dollar bill.  That's the hook?  All right.  Good enough. 
[01:17:00]  We usually play to the hook.  That's all we need.  That's all we need.  You don't like Jimmy?  It doesn't suck, but I don't love it.  I prefer Nirvana.  Well, this is not really their sound.  They were slowing it down.  They were pretty...  They got it going.  And Tree, by the way, thank you to Take the Wig. 
[01:17:30]  It was a Boston hardcore band.  Oh, really?  Sort of remember them now.  Sort of.  Yeah, that's why.  Goodbye, mama.  We're taking this too far.  It's time to tell you what's going on.  This is so 90s.  Jesus.  You think this sounds dated now?  Dude.  Everything for the 90s sounds so fucking dated.  Fucking old, man.  I mean, it's good and all, but you listen to it, and it's as noticeable that it's 90s as 
[01:18:00]  80s music is that it's 80s.  Well, it's not our fault most of the bands fagged it down the last few years.  It certainly did.  Thank God I never left the 70s.  The thousands sucked.  Oh, yeah.  The 70s.  Yeah, really?  Black Sabbath.  Kiss.  So you listen to Kiss.  This sounds dated because they've been fagging it down.  They're getting rid of guitars and everything.  That's a cool song.  I might have to download this one. 
[01:18:30]  It's amazing how shit just, like, you never notice that a decade really has a sound to  it until it's gone.  Then you listen back and go, yeah, I guess that was the sound.  It's a few originals.  Because now it's like, what the fuck is the sound now?  What is it?  Diddy Bop.  So, so.  Um, Diddy Bop?  Yeah, Diddy Bop.  What's Diddy Bop?  Give me an example of this decade's sound. 
[01:19:00]  P. Diddy's brand new song, Diddy Bop.  I learned it on P. Twitty TV.  No, no, no.  Could you give me a copy of Diddy Bop?  Is it in the system?  Um, Diddy Bop Bop.  I got a CD.  No?  Sam has been moonlighting with Shade.  Oh, I know.  Shade, what?  45 is it called there, Sam?  Yeah.  Hip-Hop Nation, or is that another station?  I don't know.  The other side.  There he goes.  Wow, so I guess.  Fucking duck feet.  Holy shit, the way he runs with those duck feet.  He would be great in the tire race.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  If your company's having one of those, like, company picnics, and you need someone to run  through the tire.  He would be fantastic.  Fantastic.  Here we go.  Look at him running back.  No one looks cool running down that hallway, by the way.  No one.  Everyone looks silly running down that hall.  This is called Diddy Bop?  It's on disc already, you weirdo.  Ugh.  And this is P. Diddy.  Why do you have this?  What did he sample?  What's the matter?  What did he sample for this one?  Smells weird over here.  Oh.  Oh, did Jimmy make...  That's Dan's breakfast. 
[01:20:00]  Did Jimmy make a poop?  No.  No?  Yeah.  This is, uh...  Oh, fucking A.  Wow, okay.  Motherfucker.  He diddy bopped out his ass.  Oof.  That is bad.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  All right.  Oof.  Diddy bop.  Yeah.  Eyes are open.  Swear.  Freshest I ever did.  Do the diddy, do the diddy, do the diddy.  That is the way.  That is the loneliest number that you live.  Is that the one he's sampling?  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  It sounds like the...  That's the loneliest number that you live.  Eyes are open.  Swear.  Freshest I ever did.  Do the diddy, do the diddy, do the diddy, do the diddy.  Light is the wave.  Pi, pi, pi.  Dance, green and the skies, and let it fly.  Do the diddy, diddy, do the diddy do the diddy bop.  Step on the scene, the city style.  Watch me diddy bop.  Diddy, diddy, do the diddy do the diddy bop.  Let me lead her survive.  Watch me diddy, diddy, diddy.  Do the diddy, do the diddy do the diddy bop. 
[01:21:00]  He ran out of a tank full of biggies.  It's gone.  It's gone, right?  Is that a...  I'm daddy.  Yeah, tell us a little bit.  I'm Diddy Boppin'.  This is a joke, right?  He's Diddy Boppin' riding in an Aston Moppin'?  What?  This is a new...  He's Diddy Boppin' riding in an Aston Moppin'.  Martin.  Moppin'.  But he's Diddy Boppin'.  It doesn't rhyme with Martin.  Well, sometimes you can kind of play with words a little bit.  Not that time. 
[01:21:30]  Nope.  You know, Sam, I know you like this type of music.  Is it good?  I'll say that's not necessarily P. Diddy's strongest outing.  I like it.  But he has done better.  That sucks.  Fuckin' asshole.  I'm getting money like a dope boy.  Born in Hawks.  I'm Gucci.  I'm Prada.  Exclusive.  I'm Louis Vuitton.  My suits is European.  My shoes is really a problem.  I like with the product.  Who gives a shit?  It's my Asian bro.  I got a Mets hat.  Who gives a fuck? 
[01:22:00]  There's nothing fucking worse.  It's horrendous.  There's nothing.  I gotta step in.  There's nothing worse in hip-hop music than that fucking product place that shit.  I got a Gucci belt.  He just saved big in cash since he was 13.  He got it.  He gets paid.  Holy shit.  Sing about something nice.  And like acorns.  Fucking pine cones.  What does he mean by Diddy Bop? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  It's his dance when he moves with his shoulders.  It's kind of like Hanson, but not as cool.  Yeah.  Um-bop or Diddy Bop is better.  She-bop?  Is it like She-bop?  No.  He-bop and They-bop?  No.  Diddy Bop is better.  What's some of those other bop songs we got?  Bob-a-bop-a-bang-a-dang-dang.  No, it's not the-  Diddy Bop beats it.  Bowser?  Diddy Bop beats it.  Why do rappers have to fucking prove?  Why is that the only sign of success in the rap community is that you have fucking, 
[01:23:00]  like, a big, a nice car?  Oh, I know.  It's all materialistic bullshit.  It's all nonsense.  How about I drive a Saturn?  You know?  And I deliver mail.  Is everybody just normal?  You know what's funny?  We're playing this song and debating if it's good or not.  It's not.  Oh, maybe it has to be a joke, right?  Boogie Couch writes, I wonder if-  Okay, I wonder if the foxhole is playing Coldplay's latest song and debating on how good it is. 
[01:23:30]  I love how this broad is very famous because her man got swept away in the tsunami.  That's the only reason-  She's pretty, man.  That's the-  Is she so hot?  Is it?  Far Raphael.  She's dating DiCaprio.  Oh, no, that's a different one.  She looks like DiCaprio.  She looks like-  But doesn't she look like the other model that's only famous because her man was swept away  by the tsunami, and that's the only reason she's famous? 
[01:24:00]  She's Israeli.  Yeah, this one's-  Is she Israeli?  This one's different, but it kind of looks like the same model.  So model hot.  I thought we were diddy-bopping.  We're not diddy-bopping.  Fuck diddy-bopping.  You know what I was trying to do there?  Why wasn't she wearing a bikini?  They got a mannequin with a bikini on it behind, kind of next door.  Do the bit!  Do the bit!  Put on the bikini!  Do the bit!  Do the bit!  Do the bit!  Look, she's got to be ten feet tall, this girl.  Diddy-bopping is awful.  Jesus.  It's not bad.  It's fucking-  It is bad.  It's horrendous. 
[01:24:30]  It's not-  It's almost-  It's not up to bad.  It's between horrendous and horrible.  Someone actually said that it sounds like Brooke Hogan's single.  No, it does not.  Brooke Hogan-  What's her single?  She doesn't have a single.  Yeah, she had one with Paul.  My daddy's rubbing my ass.  Yeah.  What's it called?  Daddy's rubbing my ass.  And mommy's fucking the pool boy.  She doesn't-  Brooke Hogan's single.  It's not her.  They don't know nothing about us.  She's like a Johnny Bravo thing.  They just kind of-  This is it.  But she has nothing to do with the song.  Nah, she's good, O. 
[01:25:00]  You like her?  Uh, yeah.  She's a Hogan.  She's a monster.  She's not bad.  She's a monster with boobs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Count it down.  One time.  Yeah.  I got my shoes.  Yeah.  I got expensive pants.  I'd like to eat her big, tall hiney, though.  Can you pause this?  Holy shit.  Uh, I don't know much about the hip-hop community, but if you're supposed to be the star of the 
[01:25:30]  song, and the song starts with the rap guy for the first minute or so, I think they might  be hiding your talent.  Rap guy's supposed to come in after you finish.  Half way through.  And then he comes in and you go like, ooh, everyone knows.  Time for rap guy!  That's what Gwen Stefani did.  Yeah, but Paul Wall's a big star.  Well, then why don't they call it the Paul Wall's song?  Because it's not on Paul Wall's album.  We haven't heard her yet.  She whispered a couple things in the beginning. 
[01:26:00]  Wait till you hear the rap.  How long are we into the song, Travis?  18 seconds.  That's it?  That's it?  No, come on.  It just felt like longer.  It sure did.  All right, get back to that song.  Let's get back to this fucking, this monolith.  Yeah.  I'd love her to sit on my face, though.  Just spit on me.  See, she's not part of this song.  She chimes in, though.  She's good.  Because the commentators are on the side chatterboxing.  Let me do it because she's good.  Holy shit, what's that?  See, Brooke. 
[01:26:30]  It's all perspective.  I ain't a bad ass, though.  It's all perspective.  Hey, long coming out perspective.  Like a horsetail?  She could be two inches tall.  Could be done with a macro lens.  It would look great.  All right.  Where is Brooke?  This is her song.  Paul Wall's the first verse.  Let him have the first verse.  First verse?  Let him have the first verse.  First song?  No, for just...  It's just that whiny, high shit. 
[01:27:00]  There's a million broads out there doing the same thing.  Now I'd be immortal, Brooke Hogan.  You guys missed something.  Wow.  Sam used the word chatterbox.  Chatterbox.  That's what Paul Wall said.  He said commentators are on this side chatterboxing.  What does chatterboxing mean?  It's like talking.  Listen how processed this shit is.  Listen how processed this shit is.  She's kind of sing rapping.  I like the crossover.  Oh, back to the guy with the talent. 
[01:27:30]  Paul Wall.  They both have talent.  She's sexy, man.  She's barely in this song.  Infected.  There she is again.  All right.  Can we get rid of this?  Why?  This is good.  Thank you, Tim.  What's she saying?  Fronting?  Why is she...  Fronting.  Fronting.  Because people...  She sees him fronting.  What does she know about fronting?  And that's the part of the car her brother goes through when he hits something.  I never thought I'd say bring on that... 
[01:28:00]  Paul Wall is white.  Fronting might be what that 19-year-old surfer dude is doing to her mother.  Oh, okay.  Fronting, rearing, mouthing.  He's a white rapper?  Yeah, Paul Wall is white.  White?  That's a white voice.  He's from the south, the dirty, dirty...  Get out of here.  That guy was white?  Yeah.  That rapper guy was white?  Yeah, he makes grills.  Was he white like...  What do you mean he makes grills?  You know, the diamond.  The diamond and gold teeth?  Mm-hmm.  Teethes? 
[01:28:30]  Is he white like you say you're white?  Yeah, exactly.  He's white.  Like you?  I'm white.  Well...  Well...  Like you, right?  That's still open for...  Yeah, I mean, I'm white, he's white.  All right, well, now we don't understand.  Can we hear you on Shade 45?  Any clips of you?  Oh, yeah.  We don't have them ready yet.  Do you mess up your voice?  Do you do any mime impressions, or...?  No, my voice...  Because they, uh...  He probably messes up his voice all of a sudden.  Oh, I bet he gets all ghetto.  I bet he gets all ghetto and shit.  I have tapes, not here, at home, of me really messing up my voice in college. 
[01:29:00]  To play the part, see?  Yeah.  Really?  You know.  Yeah.  Well, I mean...  That's why...  How do you know I'm not messing up my voice now?  Why would anyone want to talk like you talk?  Exactly.  It's a character voice.  You've been doing it forever.  Who brought in the Rochester story?  I did.  Sam.  From Rochester.  What's this all about?  Well, Popeyes ran out of chicken.  How'd that happen?  You can't run out of chicken.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:29:30]  Iran's got a chick skin.  How do you run out of chicken?  They were having a special, and they ran out of chicken before dinner time.  And everyone left peacefully.  Is that what happened?  Well, it wasn't such a news story, except that the news...  I guess it was a slow news day, and this ABC affiliate in Rochester decided they were  only going to interview black people.  Why?  Popeyes chicken.  There's no white people around.  There was no...  Oh, literal Jim.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, am I an ass? 
[01:30:00]  Wait, you were really giving an answer?  Well, I was joking.  No, no, no.  You're just giving an answer?  I was kidding.  Bring in the mind, boss.  I was kidding.  I was kidding.  Fly pelican.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  I was kidding.  Thanks for the info, Jimmy.  I appreciate it.  I, um...  I was rid of old Jim without irony.  I know.  What are you doing, Real Rock TV in 1996?  I do Real Rock TV.  I just...  I'm very tired. 
[01:30:30]  I'm very...  I'm a sleepy boy.  Aw.  All right.  Why don't we, uh, learn about Popeyes and what happens when you run out of...  Motherfucking Popeye.  Chicken.  Let's get all our black stories out of the way before Al Jackson comes in here.  Yeah.  Because we got a preacher that's, uh...  Good plan.  ...begging.  Preacher David Manning begs not to give America to the Negroes.  Then rants about the Kennedys.  It's another terrific story.  Preacher Anthony Ho.  Problem.  Customers at the drive-thru heard this recorded message.  Hi, guys. 
[01:31:00]  It's not an inconvenience, but we are all out of chicken, and we are closed for the rest  of the day.  Thank you, and have a blessed day.  You can't run out of chicken.  What?  They probably had something wrong with the chicken they had.  There's nothing wrong with the chicken.  They had a sale on the chicken.  It was a special day.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that...  You ever see that video?  No.  That's great.  That's a good song, though.  Oh, it's great.  With the old lady.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Yeah, she's making the chicken in the woods.  That's some shit.  What?  Ghetto fried chicken.  Like a video on YouTube, yo. 
[01:31:30]  Where you been?  Where you be at, motherfucker?  See, you're diddy-bopping now.  Yeah, I'm diddy-bopping.  I'm diddy-bopping.  This is a new...  We're very...  Oh, yeah.  We're very progressive to play that diddy-bop song.  I mean, that song premiered on Friday, and we're already playing it.  That ain't the motherfucking video, Danny.  Come on, man.  Oh, diddy-bopping his...  That's it.  It is.  Listen to this, yo. 
[01:32:00]  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're going to fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  You're here, mate.  Everybody want a kiss of my chicken.  Let me try to get in the little kid.  It's way better than that diddy-bop.  It's not very diddy-bop.  It couldn't be real.  Everybody want a kiss of my chicken.  And it's just a young African-American eating chicken. 
[01:32:30]  And dancing to the chicken song.  Something tells me I know where I haven't found this video.  Yeah.  Now she goes.  I got a plan.  Listen.  I'm going to fry this chicken in my hand.  I got some hot grease and a whole chicken.  Go and wash your hands because you're going to be nicking them.  Big old thing of fries.  Fried some spice all on them.  My fried chicken going to take you over.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken.  They just got that fresh hot kettle fried chicken. 
[01:33:00]  Fried and chicken.  This is real.  There's a lady in the woods.  Who wants to eat chicken in the woods?  Bugs on it.  Fried and crack.  It brings a little game.  Why is this program that would use this as like the Nazis used to use those videos of Jewish people? 
[01:33:30]  This is like the equivalent of like David putting up a YouTube video of like him having a money counting party.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Count that money.  What's the next video?  Watermelon.  Watermelon.  She's in a dirt in the fucking woods.  And there's like these people dancing and stomping for her chicken.  She fried her chicken, yo.  What is this?  She's fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Let's learn why Popeyes ran out of chicken. 
[01:34:00]  Who is this lady?  I want to know more.  You'll never know.  She's peaches, by the way.  I mean, peaches.  First of all, who wrote the lyrics to this?  Do-do-do-do.  You got it.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  They can't wait.  Yeah, we got fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  You like the wings.  Yeah.  You like the thigh.  And then they pick it up with their... 
[01:34:30]  Oh boy.  It's very well...  Why?  It's very well directed, this video.  It really is.  Oh, they're hoping for a hit?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going to hit.  You like the white meat.  Love you like the leg.  I'm dancing holding raw chicken.  You like the thigh.  You like the white meat.  Love you like the leg.  You like the white meat.  Everybody wanna piece of my chicken.  Floating by.  Right.  You got it.  It's so annoying.  It's the worst song ever. 
[01:35:00]  But I can't stop watching.  It's all I want to think about.  Everybody wanna piece of my chicken.  Floating by.  This is going to be in everyone's head.  Finger lick.  Baby.  She has on a weird blue fucking...  A weird blue hat.  Yeah.  It's like a swimming cap almost.  And she got gigantic fake fingernails.  Which are really disgusting when she's baking chicken with them. 
[01:35:30]  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  That was a great song, wasn't it?  It's fucking horrendous.  I found that on a website.  I'm out of feeling.  Yes.  I don't think they meant it for the spirit that it was originally made in.  Here's the Popeye story.  Why do they run out of chicken?  Chicken.  And then they go on the street.  Customers at the drive-thru heard this recorded message. 
[01:36:00]  Sorry for the inconvenience, but we have all out of chicken and we are close for the rest  of the day.  Thank you and have a blessed day.  One woman yelled back at the machine.  We were back.  People have kids and they're trying to feed for the special.  And you mean to tell me that we can't feed our kids?  Because I didn't order enough chicken.  I knew y'all was having the special almost two months ago.  And that's warm.  But no one was listening.  The Popeye's on Lake Avenue was closed by dinnertime.  I think that's bad because I'm sure hungry. 
[01:36:30]  No chicken.  No chicken?  They just had a chicken.  I said I'm calling the customer service now to see where there's another Popeye's at.  Oh my God.  Holy shit.  This is the news.  It's not like a joke.  It's not like a...  Is this a skit from a comedy show?  Do these people see a leprechaun?  There's no editing.  There's every...  They talked to many different people.  Yes.  Had many different faces on the news.  Just black people.  Only black people on the news. 
[01:37:00]  Other locations ran out of chicken too.  The $4.99 special, Too Good to Pants Up.  I just left Penfield Popeye's.  They were out of chicken there so I ran to the city to this one and they're out too.  This is ridiculous.  They should have to track the tail out back with extra chicken on ice, you know?  I was trying to feel like what?  They should have a tractor trailer out back with extra chickens on ice out back.  Because then they wouldn't run out of chicken.  Fry that chicken. 
[01:37:30]  Fry that chicken.  Finger lick it.  Damn it.  You want it?  You want it?  I want to say hi to everyone on the Southern State Parkway.  Ah, yeah.  Have fun.  It's a death.  Having a good time?  So you're going to be there for a while.  We're looking at the picture right now.  If you just ran into the traffic jam.  If you're in the back of the traffic jam.  Shoot yourself in the head.  Tell your boss you're taking the day off.  Yes.  You're not.  Oh, and then look at that wide open road.  Hang a Yui and just go home. 
[01:38:00]  Just scrape the remains off the road and get it moving.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  Fry that chicken.  Finger lick it.  Nice, you know?  I was trying to feed my family tonight.  Can't get that bucket in now.  Customers felt duped.  They got to get their stuff together.  You know, they put their advertisements on and then they don't show up for it.  More disappointed than angry.  You know, we've been looking forward to this day.  They got to sign it on national TV. 
[01:38:30]  How you going to run out of chicken?  You know what?  The customers are right.  That stupid Popeye should not have run out of chicken.  A big tractor trailer is not the solution.  That ram's got a chick skin.  That's how bad the economy is.  People are mad about a final on chicken promotion.  Yeah.  Are we going to give them a shame, shame, shame on you?  Some woman is running from chicken plate Popeye's to Popeye's.  Then I went into the city and then I went out of the Popeye's and they was out too. 
[01:39:00]  The tractor trailer is great though.  Yeah.  They ought to have that with fucking carbone frozen on a hook in the back.  I want some fucking Popeye's fried carbone.  Fried wop.  Let's go to Matt in Arizona.  Fried at wop.  Fried at wop.  Matt, what do you got?  I was wondering why Sam wasn't promoting the gatefish song by Kanye West. 
[01:39:30]  I think that's the next one on the progressive scale.  What is that one about?  That's from South Park.  We have the disc somewhere.  They made fun of Kanye West.  And it's on the fish dig episode.  It's not a real Kanye West song.  It's a South Park guy's making fun of Kanye West song.  Oh, let's hear that.  I can't read Steve from Bayshore.  I'll acknowledge Steve from Bayshore's genius humor.  But again, and I said this on a show the other day that I was doing from the compound.  There's 90% of the stuff I could say from Steve. 
[01:40:00]  And then there's a genius 10% that just cannot ever be said on the air.  And that was one of them.  Holy shit.  Is that funny?  Why would Steve tempt Anthony?  I know.  What are you saying, Stephen S.?  Fry that chicken.  Uh, right in Alabama.  Alabama, man!  Alabama, man!  Hey, uh, I watched the video yesterday.  If you notice the first lady that's wondering how she's going to feed her kids, she's driving  a brand new gigantic SUV.  Really?  Just wanted to point that out. 
[01:40:30]  How about you go to the, uh, uh, the soupy market?  You go to the supermarket, buy some fucking chicken.  Because it's not the same.  And cook it for your kids.  It's not the same.  Hold on, guys.  What?  Hold on.  Black eye alert.  Oh, excuse me.  Shh, shh, shh.  Let him pass.  How about that stock market, huh?  Fry that chicken!  Fry that chicken!  Fry that chicken!  Finger lickin'!  He killin' it!  Fry... 
[01:41:00]  Hold on, another one.  Hold on.  Oh, shit, it is.  All right.  And a very large one.  Yes.  Um, so, how's your portfolio looking, Opie?  It's, uh, not looking that good right now.  Is it diversified?  I hope it is.  Because a diversified portfolio of...  Lord over.  Fry that chicken!  Fry that chicken!  Fry that chicken!  Lickin'!  Yeah, meep!  I like our new bit. 
[01:41:30]  It's Cheez-It.  Black guy's coming.  Where's fuckin' Fatso?  Does he have the South Park disc or not?  We want to see people around here.  He's just fuckin' eight heads poppin'.  I have, uh, I have it on YouTube here if you want.  I'll thank God for Danny.  Jesus.  All right.  Yo!  South Park, make fun of Kanye West.  Uh, uh, uh.  Uh.  I guess...  Nah. 
[01:42:00]  Uh, come on.  I've been so lonely, girl.  I've been so satin' down.  Couldn't understand why haters joked around.  I want to do the three with other creatures like me.  And now I got my wish.  Cause I know that I'm a gay fish.  Gay fish.  Gay fish, yo.  Motherfuckin' gay fish.  Gay fish.  I'm a fish, yo.  Coming on a gay fish.  That's all right, girl.  Making love to other gay fish.  Gay fish.  All the lovely nights at the grocery store.  If I'm frozen fish, I'll feed them like a whore. 
[01:42:30]  Cause I wasn't being true.  Even the other one said that I had to make a switch.  Gay fish.  Now I know that I'm a gay fish.  Gay fish.  Gay fish, yo.  Motherfuckin' gay fish.  I'm a fish, yo.  Don't we gonna get fish, get fish.  Yeah, I think it needs a little stuff.  Yeah, there was, obviously,  if you didn't see the episode,  you have no idea what's going on.  On the disc, there was clips from the episode.  They were doing the fish sticks joke that is,  do you like fish sticks?  And then you say yes.  And then you say,  do you like fish sticks in your mouth?  And you say yes.  And then you say, 
[01:43:00]  well, that makes you a gay fish.  And somebody did the joke to Kanye West,  and Kanye West spent the entire episode  throwing tantrums because he didn't get the joke.  And he insisted he was not a gay fish.  Holding press conferences, you know,  of explaining that he was definitely not a gay fish.  And in every press conference,  they said,  Kanye, do you like fish sticks?  And he was like,  yeah, I love fish sticks.  And they were like,  oh, so you're a gay fish.  And he said,  no, I'm not a gay fish.  And then he came to the conclusion  that obviously what they were trying to get across  was that he is indeed a gay fish.  A gay fish. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, a lot of people say,  if you didn't see the episode,  you won't understand.  Now I understand, though.  Nice explanation.  Let's play Diddy Bop.  People are confused  that they're driving all over Rochester  to find, you know,  cheap chicken.  Friday.  You know,  with the whole gas thing,  you know.  Oh, right, yeah.  Wasting all your money on  trying to find the cheap chicken.  With a matter of  defeating the purpose.  And they say,  while supplies last.  A lot of people are saying that.  Oh, it does say,  while supplies.  While supplies didn't last.  That's right. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, have we played Leprechaun,  or Boo Got Shot,  any of those in a long time?  We got,  I think we're going to play  Leprechaun going into break.  Oh, nice.  Let's do that.  We got Al Jackson,  I think, standing by.  Where to go, Dad?  Where to go, Dad?  It's another one  they made a remix of.  You can find that on YouTube.  Al's here?  Yeah, man.  He's scheduled for eight,  so he'll probably show up at nine.  Oh, jeez.  What is this?  What?  Let's play some Diddy Bop  so we can get back  to positivity here.  Diddy Bop?  Diddy Bop sucks. 
[01:44:30]  Diddy Bop doesn't suck.  It's not the best  P. Diddy song ever,  but it's not the worst.  I think his fans are starting  to realize how bad he really is.  He's terrible.  His blogs are fucking boring.  Horrendous.  What a bore.  He, you know what he is?  He's a talentless nothing.  No.  He is talentless.  He fucking took that,  that Sting song,  the police song,  he wrote a little homage  to Biggie.  Biggie Smalls.  He wrote a 30 second rap song  and played the police song.  And it launched him  into the public eye 
[01:45:00]  where he now resides  as if every week  he's putting out another hit.  The guy hasn't put out shit  since that song.  Yeah.  No.  At least.  You know what I mean?  He's a good,  he throws great parties.  Yeah,  that's what he does.  Great parties.  Great parties.  He's got his own dick.  He's also a producer.  He owns a label.  He's got clothing line.  He milked all that shit  out of one fucking song 
[01:45:30]  because his fucking main man homie  died,  got killed.  Yeah,  this is it.  All right,  watch.  The police.  The police.  The police.  Sampling is okay.  The police.  Still the police.  Why didn't the fucking police sue?  Look at what he's like.  Sting was involved with this shit.  Still the police.  I think they performed it together  at the MTV Music Awards.  A little ditty now.  over the police music.  This shit is fire. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Glad you did.  Got me out of the red.  Successful.  Yeah,  what?  All right.  Yeah.  That's a good song.  I mean,  but it's not a song.  Well,  it is.  That police riff is terrific.  If you didn't get shot,  I'd be sleeping on a cop.  Yeah.  Faith Evans.  Yeah,  but this is the police. 
[01:46:30]  This isn't new words.  Yeah.  Same words.  Just same words.  Did the police say,  I'll be missing you?  Oh,  they changed it slightly?  Yeah.  A little spin towards it.  Every time I pray,  I'll be watching you.  All right.  They said,  I'll be missing you.  He ain't missing him.  He was never fucking more popular  than after Biggie died.  Stop already.  Pete Diddy.  Changing his name.  He's Puff Daddy.  He was Puff Daddy.  Remember?  He was Diddy.  No,  no,  no.  He's got three different names. 
[01:47:00]  He started with what?  Sean Puffy.  He was Ted Diddy at one point.  And then he changed it.  Ted Diddy?  Who was Ted Diddy?  Everybody should wear white to my party.  Ted Diddy?  What's up,  Ted Diddy?  Hello,  Mrs. Lopes.  Oh,  I thought you were Davey Lopes' wife.  You're Jennifer Lopez.  I'm an old Dodgers fan.  Ted Diddy.  Ted Diddy.  Ted Diddy.  He's great.  He was Puff Daddy 
[01:47:30]  until that shooting went down  a few years back.  Yeah.  He didn't want the Puff Daddy name  being associated with that club shooting,  so then he just decided he was P. Diddy.  Then he was P. Diddy.  Then he just went to Diddy.  Now he's Diddy.  It's the same guy.  Now he's an asshole.  Asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which one is this?  This is it.  Yeah, boys.  This thing went and taught the police.  That sellout fruit stood there  and sang his own song being butchered.  Of course.  What a douche.  I was waiting for this one.  Oh, here it is.  This is the good one?  Yeah.  All right, let's hear it. 
[01:48:00]  Come on, come on.  Come on.  Sometimes I rhyme slow.  Sometimes I rhyme quick.  I was on 125 in St. Nick.  Chillin' with this chick named Tom DeLeo.  There's a hot girl and everybody wanted to sleep.  When's he gonna talk about what he's wearing?  Only when it's born in the school.  Or owning.  Six figures in campcores.  Six figures are riding campcores.  I mean.  I got Bentley Vincent in the style.  Bentley.  Shut the fuck up!  What happened?  Wait till the hook.  I can't help that I'm an optimist. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, Sam.  Sam.  Sam.  Sam, take it.  Take it, Sam.  The D, the D, the Y, the D, the I, the D.  It's Diddy.  Hold up.  It's Diddy.  What's that?  The D, the T, the Y, the D, the D, the I, the I, the D.  It's Diddy.  It's Diddy.  What is that lifted from? 
[01:49:00]  Is that da-da, da-da, da-da?  That's not his.  That's such an old rap song.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  It is.  That's old rap.  If anybody knows what that is.  New York to Los Angeles.  Talk about more shit you own.  New York to Los Angeles.  Just trying to keep it real?  Get out your seats and clap your hands to this.  Because I came too far for me.  He popped my hands to me.  He told me.  It's a fun hand clapper.  Do you hear what you say?  You say you call it a Bentley.  I call it a blue car.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  Nothing to happen.  Nothing.  Really?  Nothing.  Give him a Toyota Corolla and see if he calls it a blue car.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Does that stink?  He's terrible.  Enough about fucking singing about what you own.  He's not a good rapper.  Oh, man.  A lot of people are pointing out that we shouldn't say that because we've been bragging about the  12 TVs we got in our first week here at Series XM.  You think if we fucking got the boot that we'd be taking these home?  What do you think these are?  Fucking secret Santa prizes?  I will prove we own them.  Give me a hammer. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  If we own them, we can break them, right?  Yeah.  We don't.  12 TVs and two offices.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got 12 TVs and two offices.  Mad headphones.  Kenny, can you spell out our names, please?  Like Diddy does.  Fuck more girls with venereal disease.  Move over, Sam.  It's like the fuck thing.  Kenny's going to do it right by us.  Spell our names out like Diddy does.  Wait.  First, I'll say it's O&A all the way. 
[01:50:30]  That's what I say.  Oh, but that's not like hip-hop.  I know, but I'm an original.  Kenny's head is filled with couch stuffing.  You're retard-y.  It's the O to the P to the I to the E, the A, the N, the D, and the A, and the N, the T,  the H, to the O, to the N, to the Y, it's Opie and Anthony, with the W, I, T, and the H,  and little J-I-M-M-Y, it's Jimmy. 
[01:51:00]  It's the D to the U to the M to the M to the Y, it's Kenny.  Yeah, that's a hit song.  Can you go record that?  That's burning up the charts.  Sam, help him record that, will you?  And you've got to sing about all the shit you got.  I've got a truck with no GPS, I've got a hair with no moisture.  I can't believe you spelled out that.  This fucking truck has an Etch-A-Sketch radio.  Spelled out and. 
[01:51:30]  What a jerk.  God, I hate you.  He spelled the and.  I thought he was going right into the A-N-T-H-O-N-Y.  The end is the chorus.  Oh, okay.  I didn't realize.  I didn't realize.  That is funny.  Can we get him in a studio?  Get a little beat behind him?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll have to write some rhymes for him, though.  Oh, yeah.  No, that's pretty much it.  Maybe just jack that up a little bit.  You just want to have some Diddy music behind it?  Yeah, a little, just give him a little something to do that over. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let's bust that beat.  And he's going to go off the dome.  Wait, did he ruin Zeppelin, too?  Matt and Queensbury.  Did he steal something from them that they stole from some black shot?  He stole it back for the black man, of course.  Yeah.  That's right.  There it is.  Cashmere?  Yeah, don't forget, he ruined Cashmere before he ruined that police song.  I can't hear you, Matt.  The music's way too loud.  Oh, my God.  What's he doing here?  What, Matt?  I said he ruined Cashmere before he ruined that police song. 
[01:52:30]  I had no idea.  He didn't ruin it.  He did it on Saturday Night Live.  Even Jimmy Page bastardized himself and jammed with him on it.  Of course he did.  He did.  He did.  He didn't ruin it, assholes.  Fucking Jimmy.  Fucking I love your guts, Page.  It all started with Aerosmith doing Walk This Way again.  Yeah, they blew it for everybody.  Yeah.  Should have kept the races separate.  Right, Ant?  You know what I'm talking about.  You know what I'm talking about, Antony.  What's he rapping about in this?  Did he own Bentleys yet? 
[01:53:00]  Not yet.  He's been getting cash since he was 13.  You can't rap over an amazing riff and call the song your own.  Do they go into the...  Watch how easy this is.  Give me the beginning of Cashmere.  Kenny, get back up.  He does.  He does.  This isn't sampling.  This is the song.  This is the actual riff.  It's a reimagination.  No, they threw one little track in there.  You can hear the one track to make it more, like, rhythmic.  A little better.  All right, Kenny. 
[01:53:30]  Give me the real Cashmere.  Watch what Kenny can do.  Just like Pete Diddy.  Yeah.  I don't know why he's fetching stuff for us.  We got the next rap star right here in our midst.  You got that very much correct.  All right.  Oh, Christ.  All right.  Give me some Cashmere for Kenny.  Watch him just freestyle.  We don't write shit for this show.  No.  Why would we?  Here we go.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I can't find Cashmere. 
[01:54:00]  I'm sure you're not talking.  Steve from Bigger is two for two on shit I can't say.  That's hysterical.  Is that the actual name of the song?  Yes.  Cashmere?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Led Zeppelin?  What's the...  No, it's not Led Zeppelin.  It's the Beatles, dummy.  I swear to God, it's not in here.  Really?  How are you spelling it?  Zeppelin.  I'm not spelling it.  I'm just doing a search for Led Zeppelin.  What, are you just talking into the mouth?  What are you doing?  It's Cashmere. 
[01:54:30]  Is it spelled with a C or a K?  K.  I might do the K.  Let's go.  K.  Oh, my God.  Did you spell it with a C?  No.  Please say you did.  Oh, you fucking...  Oh, you emo fruit.  You wouldn't know.  You should check your messages in there.  I found it.  Of course you did.  Ugh.  All right.  Will you tell Butcher to shut the fuck up?  Where are we from?  Shh.  Hey, can you tell Frankenstein hair that he's on the fucking...  Uh...  What?  Butcher cut off.  All right.  Here's Kenny. 
[01:55:00]  Freestyle to Cashmere.  Just like Pete did.  Fucking...  Just dopey hair.  Do the O to the P.  I'm a big stupid dope.  There is no hope.  O and A paved the way.  They think my hair is hay.  Because it's the O and A all the way.  That's what I say.  Because you got the O to the P to the I to the E to the A to the N to the D.  You got the capital A to the N to the T to the H to the O to the N to the Y. 
[01:55:30]  And let's not forget little J-I-T-Double-M-Y.  We got Prime Time rocking the mic.  And we got Danny on the beatbox.  I beat you with a fucking boss.  Get down tonight. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, you got to do a little sampling in there.  Yeah.  Even though we got Cashmere.  Sample something else.  A little scratching.  Has Danny ever done a beatbox?  No.  Never.  Only when he was too loaded to talk.  It was accidental.  That's a work in progress.  Yeah, is it?  Yeah, it's a work.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Bill Burr should be here soon.  No Al Jackson?  I don't know.  I've been listening to Diddy.  I think he's here.  Diddy, yo. 
[01:56:30]  All right, we'll...  Diddy, yo.  Oh, we got to do the jet flyby thing.  Yes.  Let's do a little news.  See what's going on out there for everybody.  Keep them informed.  And other things.  But we have to take a break.  Do you know what I mean?  Opie and Anthony.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community.  Many of you bring binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it look like a leprechaun to me.  I got to look up in a tree.  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah?  Yeah! 
[01:57:00]  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears.  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like.  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  It could be a crackhead that got home to the wrong stuff and it told him to get up in a tree and play a leprechaun. 
[01:57:30]  We're going to get down to the bottom of this.  You're still on there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This was all smells right here.  This is the special leprechaun flute, which has been passed down from thousands of years ago from my great-great-grandfather, who was Irish.  And I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree. 
[01:58:00]  I'm going to run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I want to know where to go.  I want the gold.  Give me the gold.  I want the gold.  Opie and Anthony.  Where am I going?  Also, Jim Norton, of course, who taped Letterman last night.  It's going to air Friday.  We've got Bill Burr in studio.  Bill Burr, back on the East Coast, so he'll be doing the show off and on for the rest of the week. 
[01:58:30]  Right, Bill?  We like when you come by for a whole week.  I'm here Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.  Doing a little Caroline's?  Yes, I am.  212-757-4100.  And then Al Jackson, who's a very funny comic, his first appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  Is it really?  I saw you've done stuff with Jimmy, and then you warmed up the crowd for Jim Jeffries for his HBO tape, right?  I did Jim's last one, too, yeah.  Both Jim's.  Exactly.  Okay. 
[01:59:00]  Is that frustrating?  That's why I thought you were on the show.  Just what?  Just warming up?  I was sitting there.  Jim Jeffries is taping his HBO special, and you're warming up the crowd.  There's what?  A couple thousand people there, maybe?  Yeah, maybe two.  Two thousand.  You're killing.  I mean, killing.  And I'm thinking, well, I could watch this on HBO.  It would be nice.  Anybody out there listening, help.  I'm not even kidding.  That's what you think.  Like, well, this guy's really funny, too.  I'd watch this.  And then you have to leave, and then Jim Jeffries comes out.  You're not factoring in the, I don't care, I get hammered anyway.  Like, as soon as he's on stage, I'm already drinking Tall Boys downstairs. 
[01:59:30]  It's got to hurt a little bit, because you're on stage, and you're like, wow, I know I'm  killing.  Yeah.  I'm getting some big laughs up here.  Yeah, the good thing is-  Wake up, HBO people.  Yeah, come on, man.  You know, but it's so nice.  I'll buy my time.  I'm glad you guys brought me on the show with a real comic that has real stuff to promote,  like Bill Burr.  Oh, yes.  He's got-  I'm a carol.  I'm like, I'm doing a one-nighter in Hartford on Thursday.  It's funny bowling.  Thank you.  Well, we tried to spread you guys out, but then we went a little long in the last segment,  so now you've got to compete with the great Bill Burr. 
[02:00:00]  You guys weren't here talking about hip-hop without me, man.  I'm offended.  Oh, my God.  We weren't talking about hip-hop.  We were talking about P. Diddy.  Yes, there's a difference.  Who is not fucking hip-hop.  That guy is so spent.  The guy is just- I don't think he ever had talent, to tell you the truth.  Be honest with you.  I don't think he ever had talent.  He was able to surround himself with people that did.  Yeah, apparently.  He's got a nice clothing line if you want a blazer.  Oh, that's all that- that's like-  The guy-  He's got like $1,200 pajamas you can buy. 
[02:00:30]  He might know how to market himself.  Yeah, because his fans got the $1,200 for the pajamas.  He might know how to market his ass, but-  Some mink slippers.  Sorry, yeah.  Alligator slippers.  Yeah, that's funny.  I got my mink slippers.  I better get something that K-Mart could put in their store.  Yeah.  Relax a little bit, P. Diddy.  I like his- I like a lot of his clothes, but they just got that big, uh, Sean John thing  on it, and then you feel like you're- you're trying to, uh, you're selling out.  Yeah, you feel like you're selling out.  I'm not a logo guy.  Yeah.  It was really silly.  It doesn't have an alligator or a polo on it. 
[02:01:00]  I just feel like, you know-  The worst was watching white guys walking around with fubu shit on them.  That was just like, you know something-  That was right before fubu went to, like, Dillard's and Macy's.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Well, they officially don't sell to the urban market anymore now.  Yeah.  It's all a bunch of fucking young white guys wearing fubu.  Yeah, it's for us.  Buy us, motherfuckers.  You're a white kid from fucking, like, home.  What are you talking about?  Dicks Hills or something.  It comes with your first do-rag little starter one.  My first do-rag starter kit. 
[02:01:30]  They take a mugshot of you at Dillard's and you can show it to people.  You get to print, fingerprint yourself.  Yeah, that'd be fun.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, it just became, like, the Sean John thing and P. Diddy.  You know what?  You didn't like his music, though?  The P, the I, the D, the D, the Y, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D, the D.  You hear Kenny's version?  Oh, yes. 
[02:02:00]  You hear Kenny's version?  No.  Oh, it's going to be a hit.  Oh, okay.  We're going to record it later.  I don't even want to know.  I don't even want to know what it is.  He did the same thing.  It's an abomination.  He spelled our names out.  Can you play that for Bill?  Oh, okay.  So poorly.  Travis, if you can find that the first time he did it.  It's awful.  Look under the folder marked Magic.  That was a great moment.  Horrible.  It's just...  Oh, you know, speaking of that magic or whatever, I finally, like, I didn't see that lady over there. 
[02:02:30]  The girl who looks like she was in a fairy tale.  You see that deck deck?  She looks like Fred Flintstone in drag.  The girl from Scotland who came out and sang that song.  Oh, Susan Boyle.  Who ogre from Revenge of the Nerd.  Dude, I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in my life when I was watching.  I was dying laughing because it was a great thing to see, but I don't know.  They were mocking her.  But it was just something so funny that ugly people can do stuff.  That's what it was.  That's so funny. 
[02:03:00]  Like, she was out there, and as they're questioning her, people are laughing, openly just laughing at her.  And she starts singing, and she's got this great voice, and everyone's like,  Oh, my God!  This fucking freak!  Yeah, but you gotta admit.  She can't sing!  But you gotta admit, that was literally a Hollywood movie.  Like, you'd be like, that would never happen.  Not in real life, right.  You know what's funny was my girl was giving me a rough time just going,  Ah, I'm so sick.  She was basically saying that.  I don't like how everybody's all excited that ugly people can do stuff.  And I said, she walked out. 
[02:03:30]  Did you see how she was dressed with mismatch and stockings?  Like, you walk on stage, you're asking to be judged.  Yeah.  And she's a mess.  That's true.  Those dead ass in her eyebrows.  They fucked it up, though.  They gave her a makeover.  Leave her ugly.  That was her charm as being ugly.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I want to have.  That's what I want to have.  You're uglier.  What, do you think she looks good now?  She's fucking still a one.  That's where the movie part ends.  But that's the problem.  Where she gets the makeover, and she's beautiful. 
[02:04:00]  No, she gets the makeover.  Now she's just ugly with makeup on.  Yeah, they just polished her up.  It's like, leave her flumpy and naturally ugly.  No, I hope they...  I'm made over ugly.  I hope they ruin her hook.  Jim made a good...  Just bow-tocks her trying to make...  She's a one.  She's a one.  You don't see ones very often.  She's a one.  She is a one.  She's a one.  Only because she's alive.  Yeah, you gotta get...  She gets...  A one.  She should be forced to travel with a fucking burlap hat with an eyehole cut in the middle  of it.  Like the first Jason.  My kid.  My kid. 
[02:04:30]  My friend.  My friend.  I'm not an animal.  I'm a fat girl.  Yuck.  Sings like an angel, though.  It would've been great if she...  At the end of her song, she grabbed her chest and just dropped dead on the fucking stage.  They would laugh all the way.  Oh, she was built like a 1970s fullback.  She looked like Greg Luzinski.  Fucking fat monster.  Third and short, they're bringing in Susan.  She's got the one... 
[02:05:00]  She's going off tackle.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Well, we got Kenny's version of the Pete Diddy song for Bill.  Oh, great.  It just went down.  And Al Jackson, you can comment because he said we weren't talking about hip-hop in front  of you.  I was offended.  Horrible.  Here we go.  This isn't hip-hop either.  Don't be here.  Do the O to the...  I'm a big stupid dope.  There is no hope.  O and A paved the way.  They think my hair is hay. 
[02:05:30]  Because it's the O and A all the way.  That's what I say.  Because you got the O to the P to the I to the E to the A to the N to the D.  Okay.  Please shut it up.  Too many places.  To the T to the H to the O to the N to the Y.  And let's not forget little J-I to the double M-Y.  All right. 
[02:06:00]  We got...  That's it, Charles.  That was good.  We should learn on this show to make things longer.  That's the same rep your dad does in the car.  It embarrasses you in front of your friends.  You're like, I'm cool.  Watch this.  You're like, Dad, shut up.  That's beyond old school.  That's just like fucking shit.  That's just awful.  We should play that where it says Danny on the beatbox.  Yeah, Danny on the beatbox.  Danny never even tried.  I never heard Danny even goop doing a beatbox. 
[02:06:30]  You know, I was on YouTube last night.  You know, just couldn't fall asleep.  But I just kept going.  And I ended up getting on to, you know, worst dunk ever.  And like a whole list of those, every one of them was a white dude.  Every one that involved a guy slamming the ball and somehow doing a somersault and landing on his head.  There was like three of those.  And they were all white dudes.  And everyone was writing underneath that this is why white people can't dunk.  And I wanted to get mad, but I couldn't.  It was just 100%.  It's true.  What about the dunk that hits the back of the rim and the ball ends up at half court? 
[02:07:00]  I didn't see that one.  And this is one where people literally were almost going to get paralyzed.  These guys were like 6'11".  They were barely up the ground.  Somehow they'd land on their head.  What is that?  It's awful.  I don't know what it is.  Al, anything?  Can you help?  Do you look at us like we're on the moon and we're still on Earth?  I dunked one time in my life.  And then I swear to God, I think I started drinking like that summer.  And that was it?  That was it, bro.  So that takes all the Irish people up. 
[02:07:30]  Johnny Walker Black.  That was the end of me.  Someone should put up a video, worst dunk ever, and it's Susan Smith.  Back in her van.  Two points.  They just keep playing this clip over and over.  What were they thinking?  The 747 being followed by another plane.  Looks like a little fighter or something.  That would freak me out.  That would definitely freak me out.  That's a big, big story in New York because we're scared shitless of a low-flying aircraft 
[02:08:00]  in New York City.  Yeah.  We've got a reason.  You know, there haven't been any low-flying, real huge commercial planes over New York City,  aside from what goes into Newark and LaGuardia and whatnot, but not over Manhattan.  And then they decided to take Air Force One and let it do that fucking X-Wing fighter Death  Star fucking maneuver through the city or some shit so they could take a photo op. 
[02:08:30]  So they could take pictures of it on Air Force One.  They buzzed the tower.  You two characters.  Come on.  Goddamn, Maverick.  Goddamn it, Maverick.  How many times during that movie?  Goddamn it, Maverick.  You're on Ready 5.  Engage, Maverick.  Goddamn it, Maverick.  Don't buzz the tower.  Maverick, get back in.  Engage.  Goddamn it, Maverick.  That's right.  We get it.  Goddamn it, Maverick.  You're not happy with Maverick. 
[02:09:00]  Again, they're not happy with him.  And that wing dips down, and it was for a photo op for what, postcards or something  that they give out?  I'll suck your dick any time.  Goddamn it, Maverick, you homo.  Yeah, they don't have Photoshop in the White House?  Exactly.  Film the fucking thing in front of a green screen.  Bill Burr's right.  Take a picture of Manhattan, and you fucking put them together.  It's easy.  You can place wherever you want.  Go to fucking that Skywalker Ranch. 
[02:09:30]  He'll hook you up.  Because flying a fucking 747 through Manhattan, it scares people.  There is so much video of that.  And you know, everyone taking it was like, come on, hit something.  I'm going to fucking be rich.  Definitely.  I'm going to be fucking rich on this one.  Dude, I bet the pilots were joking around.  You want to fly it right at the Empire State Building last second?  Last second, we'll fucking move.  We'll freak people out.  I just want to watch those people scurry.  Yeah.  Like ants.  I'm going to scare the shit out of everybody.  Buzz the tower.  Goddamn it, Maverick. 
[02:10:00]  How freaked were those people up there on the observatory,  knowing there's no way you're going to get down to the ground floor?  Oh, you're just done.  Oh, all the thinking is like, I'm the guy that's now going to have to jump.  I'm that guy.  Oh, my God.  I watched it, and now I'm going to be that guy.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's what you call an executive decision when you're like, I'm jumping off this building.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a big one.  That has got to be some heat at your back.  Yeah.  When you go like, all right, look, I just can't take the heat.  No, it's literally your brain's like, just get away from the heat. 
[02:10:30]  I'm going to deal with the gravity situation.  But they were holding hands at the time.  I'll deal with that.  Oh, yeah.  They were holding hands, so at least you had it with one other person, like, look, we got  a, it's really hot back there.  I've never watched that stuff again, and I don't understand why they still show that footage.  I'm like, this is the worst thing I've ever seen.  Why would you keep showing that?  The second I see any World Trade Center shit, I got to turn it off.  Yeah.  I don't even like, like, it ruined movies that were pre-9-11 movies.  I think that's why the movies still tank.  I still don't understand why we don't.  Like, the 93 tanked and World Trade Center tanked. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, because I don't want to fucking, and don't, don't misinterpret this as, I want to  forget, because I remember all this shit.  I love waterboarding.  I love all that fucking shit.  It's not that I forgot.  I just don't want to see it.  Right.  It's because I remember too much that I don't want to see it again.  And, you know, it.  When did they start making Pearl Harbor movies that did well at the box office?  Yeah, when did that happen?  Just out of curiosity, because to me, there goes the Arizona.  Oh, my God, it's cop-sized. 
[02:11:30]  Thousands are trapped in there and dead.  Well, this is great.  Entertaining.  Oh, here comes Ben Affleck.  Oh, it's 1972.  Finally, we can fucking deal with this.  Exactly.  Like, when the fuck did that happen?  Were you like, people aren't going, holy shit, I can't watch this.  I think most people avoid that footage, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I think in New York, it's a lot worse, though.  Because there are people all over the country that never really took it as personally as  we did living here.  And I know just from the calls we've gotten over the years and from talking to people, 
[02:12:00]  like, some people in California should be like, you know, it's fucking years ago.  Get over it.  Get over it?  I smelt burning dead people.  I lived in fucking Brooklyn.  I smelt the shit.  There was fluttering paper on my patio from the building.  Which is true.  So it's hard to get over it.  Yeah, the smell.  They never did that justice.  No.  It was horrible.  Yeah, no, it burned until mid-November. 
[02:12:30]  It was like a big fucking bonfire.  They finally put the fire out in mid-November.  Bill Burr is right.  Over two months.  Yeah, because we used to go down the cellar.  Remember that?  You'd go down the cellar and you could...  Oh, yeah.  It was the smell of burning plastic and death.  Yeah.  That was horrible.  Most news people didn't talk about that.  And you would walk around trying to make believe, like, eh, nice sunny day.  You're trying to go to lunch with some friends or something.  I remember...  Or out for drinks and it was just always in the air, that smell.  Yeah.  It was like days later.  Whatever you did.  Days later, I'm on the BQE and they're playing, uh, fucking, oh my, the Battle Hymn of the Republic 
[02:13:00]  on all the radio stations as, like, a moment of remembrance.  And I'm on the BQE.  I look over to my left and I just see the burning.  Manhattan's fucking on fire.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting there going, what?  And that's when it really hit me.  I'm like, what the fuck happened?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Like, it totally freaked me out.  And that's the shit that, when they bring up the waterboarding and, we got a, well, 
[02:13:30]  the Guantanamo detainer, you should, you know, we got carried away with that.  And we, fuck that.  Waterboard them.  Fuck it.  Hold their head in there until they don't come back up.  I don't even care if they have info or not.  They should be able to type it with their feet as their head is being held under water.  Type the info with your feet.  If you get it in time, you don't drown.  I'm with you on that, man.  I am so with you on that.  Everyone seems to have just, like, given up, though.  You get people, the Attorney General. 
[02:14:00]  Not everyone.  We'll look into it.  No, not everyone.  I got to admit, though, when the Attorney General goes, we're going to look into if anything  illegal was illegal, two fucking buildings falling down.  You know what's funny?  When they closed Guantanamo Bay, that reminded me of the beginning of Scarface.  Yeah, when they were just letting everybody out.  How do you get that scar?  Eating pussy.  For a green cup.  I'll cover them up real nice.  And then a great Democratic president move.  Fucking the Marial Boatlift.  Yeah, that was great.  That was Jimmy Carter. 
[02:14:30]  Very good.  A bunch of hard-working Cubans coming on over.  What?  Criminals?  How great was Castro?  Castro emptied his prisons.  Emptied the jails.  Just emptied the prisons.  What could I do now?  Send them on over.  You think Castro got the best of us that day?  Oh, fuck.  Did he ever?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  It's...  All right.  Watch what I do now.  Well, Wes, the trucker...  We don't even have to really go...  What?  ...because we were talking about this earlier.  He says, how dumb is America to think Air Force One was hijacked? 
[02:15:00]  Now, I don't think a lot of people really know the color code of Air Force One.  You see it a lot, but it's just a 747.  It also looks like a Southwest Airlines plane, too.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, the paint scheme is a little similar.  But if you did know it was Air Force One, you'd be like, all right.  You know, they're probably doing something.  Why is it tough to hijack Air Force One?  If they got Air Force One, we're fucked.  That's pretty much it.  You know, I got reprimanded on a flight.  What did you do, Bill?  Jesus.  And it was...  I was waiting really...  She really just made me feel stupid, right?  And how close did you come to strangling her? 
[02:15:30]  Because I know how you are.  No, I actually laughed.  Because she made me feel so fucking ignorant.  I was on a flight from...  Trying to go to Columbus.  I was going to L.A. to St. Louis.  And it was like one of the few times, like, there actually wasn't a jam-packed flight.  So I had a whole row to myself.  And I was psyched.  I wanted to lay down.  Oh, you're not the best.  So I go...  Yeah, and you know those friggin' armrests that are made out of titanium, right?  So I said to the lady, I said, excuse me, can I get a pillow?  And she goes, oh, we don't have any pillows. 
[02:16:00]  I'm like, what do you mean you don't have any pillows?  She goes, oh, we haven't had any pillows on this flight in a long time.  I go, why?  I go, there's always pillows.  Why?  And she goes, 9-11.  I go, yeah, but I go, why?  She goes, she kept going, 9-11.  So finally, I wasn't even thinking.  I just said, what do you think?  I'm going to suffocate the pilot?  And I literally acted it out like a hacky comedian.  And then she looked at me.  She goes, sir, that's just rude.  And she turned around and walked away.  I felt so...  I really felt stupid.  Why?  You were right.  It was a pillow, though. 
[02:16:30]  You were right.  You were absolutely right.  Yeah, a car.  No, it totally makes sense, Jimmy.  See, a group of terrorists hijacked planes with box cutters, knocked down a couple of buildings.  So now, there's no pillows.  No pillows.  Fucking...  You could distract the flight crew with a nude girl pillow fight.  Oh, there you go.  Which would be...  Who's not looking?  Do you know how many times I'd have to hit the pilot over the head before you even got that pillow headache?  Pillow headache.  Yeah, you did some pillow boxing with your brother's back when you were growing up, huh? 
[02:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  The figure eight was when you really beat on the goof.  No one told us when we were young that you could really do damage with a pillow if you swing it.  You know what?  That's the right way.  Well, not only that, if you twisted it around your fist, we would get like a stretch Armstrong.  I got four brothers.  We had all-out pillow boxing matches where, yeah, people went down.  Oh, yeah.  TKO's.  You know what's funny, too?  In my family, the oldest was eight years older than the younger one.  So it's like, you know, just a toddler just taking away. 
[02:17:30]  We never held back as far as beating up our little brothers.  A toddler?  Never.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Because you felt like you were really...  T-shirt and a diaper.  Just getting a standing eight count.  But it made you feel tough and strong that you could take him out, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Dude, I remember one day we actually just decided that my two younger brothers were going to fight.  We just decided they were going to fight.  So we made a ring with, like, sticks, and then we took the, you know, the brown...  The little rascals?  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  What the fuck is this?  No, we literally, we took, like, we took, like, those brown lunch sacks, filled the 
[02:18:00]  end with newspaper, and just put rubber bands around them, and just told them they had  to go at it.  You know, it was a great thing.  We did it in the front yard, and people drove by.  Nobody stopped.  Nobody gave a shit.  It was a kid fight.  Whatever.  You just reminded me of something.  When we were growing up, my grandma's beach house, my cousin Frank was way too big for  his age.  Way too big.  Like, how big?  Like, he wore a diaper still, but he looked like he could be, like, a two, two-and-a-half-year-old. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  And we had...  Is cousin Frank retarded?  No.  Honestly, doing...  Big cock on the kid.  Big hairy cock by the time he was in third grade.  Cousin Frank drove.  And he was a strong fucker in a diaper, so we had baby fights on the beach.  You just reminded me of this, with complete strangers and their kids.  Well, would you just go punch that kid?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because we were like 10, 12 years old.  Just tell me to punch another kid in the face.  We're like, oh, cousin Frank, we'll take on any of you fuckers. 
[02:19:00]  And there's the kid just trying to play in the sand, and he's got a diaper, and he's  an oversized baby.  1940s fight promoter, yeah.  Come on, all comers.  We'll take all comers.  I forgot all...  Come on down, say the world's strongest baby.  Hey, I forgot all your asses.  I forgot all about that.  He would take on everybody at the beach.  Waiting River.  Waiting River.  Where's cousin Frank now?  He died eating electrical sockets.  Cousin Frank's a fool.  Baby fights are fucking great, though. 
[02:19:30]  I forgot all about that.  If you could hook those up.  We wouldn't want to watch them.  We wouldn't want to watch them.  We wouldn't want to promote that.  Here's one for Bill.  You make your little brother play goalie for you?  Oh, yeah.  They're always little brothers, yeah.  And they didn't want to, and they'd be crying.  Stay in there.  Yeah, but it's funny.  You know, and the toughest kids, the toughest kids at school were the kids who were the youngest  and had four older brothers.  Right.  My youngest brother, I came home from school, he got sent home.  He beat up two kids at once.  It was a joke.  He finally fought, like, kids in his own weight class. 
[02:20:00]  He was fighting people, like, you know, literally 100 pounds heavier than him.  And now he can kick anyone's ass.  No, we used to kill him.  My brother has one of his ribs sticks out from me, I guess.  He said I broke his ribs.  Holy shit.  Dude, we would put my little brother crazy.  We would put Brett, the owner of FH Riley's, not going for the plug, but in goal, and we  would give him pillows and couch cushions, try to pad him up pretty good, but we would  just not hold back.  Oh, you'd shoot it right at his throat.  Yeah.  You know what would be funny was when they would be playing, you'd get some extra, like, 
[02:20:30]  you know, you'd shoot, like, tennis balls and stuff.  Yeah.  You'd get it out there, right?  And you'd get some extra ones, you'd just start pelting them.  You literally would stop playing goal and would just be turning sideways with that one  leg up.  Another question for Bill.  You run out of tennis balls because they go on the street.  Rocks.  Thank you.  Rocks.  He answered the question.  You play with rocks?  Yes.  You go to rocks?  Yes.  Holy shit.  I knew you would come up with the answer.  Just squeak another one out there, Jimmy.  You'd look around. 
[02:21:00]  You would look around for the old tennis balls, softballs, baseballs.  When all the balls were gone, then you would go with rocks.  Yeah, it's starting to get dark out.  You couldn't find it.  You're like, we'll find it tomorrow.  Come on.  It's not going to hurt.  You got on pads.  Little wrist shots with the rocks.  No face shots.  No face shots, people.  No lifting.  No lifting.  No lifting.  You lifted.  Kids bleeding.  I like that when you used to play pond hockey, and there was always the one kid who had  the balls to go out there and see if the ice was thick enough. 
[02:21:30]  You'd start.  You'd take rocks.  It was always rocks.  You'd take rocks, big rocks.  You'd throw them up in the air.  As high as you could throw them.  Have them land on the ice.  That looks pretty safe.  And then you'd have one kid go out there.  Get out there.  Rocks were the tool of the child.  It was.  You could build a whole go-kart with a rock as a hammer.  That's all you needed.  Yeah, no PlayStation.  Use it as a saw.  You'd just fucking chip away at a 2x4 with a rock.  You know what's funny about that?  I was actually talking to DeRosa the other day about how isolated you were before the 
[02:22:00]  internet, and there was only three networks.  I remember the summer Star Wars came out.  I completely missed it.  I didn't even hear about it.  I had no fucking idea.  And then once you missed it, it's over.  Yeah, and I came to school in September, and everyone's talking about Chewbacca and all  this shit.  I thought I'd move to another country.  I'm just sitting there.  What happened?  Well, Bill, there was this movie that made fucking $9 million a weekend for the last 12  weeks.  What the fuck have you done?  And if you didn't see it, you didn't see it.  For fucking years, you didn't see it.  Oh, yeah.  Betamax.  That was it. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  There was no way to see that movie until the 80s.  Seven years later, eight years later, they'd have a censored version on after one of those  awful airport 1975 movies.  Yeah, really bad.  I remember seeing, I think in the movie theater, I saw like Planet of the Apes when I was a  kid.  It was like 1968 or some shit.  And I thought...  You were 26.  I was 26.  I drove.  I drove everyone there.  Just finished my second tour. 
[02:23:00]  And even as a kid, though, I was thinking like, I wonder when I'm going to be able to  see that again.  Because I liked it.  But I would never be able to say, could I go to the movies and see that again?  Like, why?  You saw it already.  I'm not wasting money on that fucking shit.  So I was like, I wonder when I'm going to be able to see that again.  And it was literally a decade later before I saw it again.  It just wasn't...  TV didn't get the rights to those movies from years and years afterwards.  And then it would show up on Channel 11 or something in New York. 
[02:23:30]  It would.  Chopped to shit.  Right after the Money Pit with Tom Hanks.  That came on every Saturday.  Money Pit and Doom.  On something like Creature Feature.  That was one of the greatest, almost funny movies.  You sit there literally believing in it for 45 minutes with your eyebrows up.  It's going to happen.  I'm going to laugh.  And then you find it's like, I forget it.  Yeah.  If I could click, it's over.  I remember I saw Breaking 2 with my mom.  Oh, my gosh.  Electric Boogaloo.  That was very good.  Electric Boogaloo.  And then I went back and, you know, it comes on all the time on TV now. 
[02:24:00]  And Breaking 2, and especially Breaking 1.  Right.  Oh, you forget.  It's like New York, 1980.  It is flamingly gay.  But, like, when you're a little kid, you're like, breakdancing.  And then you go back and there's, like, flamingly gay dudes wearing, like, the red cup.  And, like, you know, they, like, got the leg warmers on here.  Like, oh, my God.  They walk around like that?  Yeah, like, these guys were cool.  You know what I'm saying?  It was like a lot.  Turbo and Ozone.  And they would pop lock.  Yes, they were very good.  Yeah, huh? 
[02:24:30]  What's a pop lock?  It's the way you, it's that thing they do when they fucking, I can't do it.  Lock and you pop.  Yeah.  Iraq, can you pop lock for us?  Pop lock, Iraq.  Iraq, pop lock.  Pop lock, Iraq.  Could you pop lock?  Well, Maury's here already?  Yeah, he's in the green room.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck are we going to do now?  Well, it's after 9-0-4.  We've got to bring Maury in.  How about we do a single break?  Let him do a paternity test on you.  On me?  That's what he does.  Yeah, Maury will probably stay for a little while anyway.  Maury always comes and goes.  He's like the wind, Maury.  That's it. 
[02:25:00]  Except he's not.  Maury.  Let's get him to say, like, real racist stuff today.  And then isolate it.  He gets home and just play it for the news.  Wait, how can he be here?  He's on TV.  Oh, that's impossible.  No, wait, Maury's not here.  His show's on.  Is this woman my dad?  The DNA will tell.  This guy keeps every DNA company in business.  Right.  Maury is amazing.  All right, quick break then.  It's either that or a 14-year-old whore that's fucking everyone yelling at her mother. 
[02:25:30]  We're going to have fun with Maury next.  Oh, yeah.  Bill Burr, Caroline.  Also, hopefully we get to talk about it, but I'm hearing good things about your NHL.com.  You're blogging about the playoffs.  Oh, yeah.  I just was trying to.  For real, people are loving it.  They're saying that they're hilarious.  I was just trying to piss off Canadian fans.  They actually have edited most of the stuff out that I said, which I understand.  Do you got a version that we could read somewhere?  Yeah, on my computer, maybe.  All right.  I'd have to.  Well, you're going to be here all week, so maybe bring it in tomorrow or Thursday or whatever.  And Al Jackson's playing where? 
[02:26:00]  Hartford all weekend.  Funny Bone up there.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  Maury Povich joins the program next.  Is the Funny Bone Hartford?  Yeah, they just opened it.  Maury Povich in studio. 
[02:26:30]  We have way too many people today, which is fine.  We like it like this.  Maury Povich, how are you, sir?  Why do you do our show?  Because as soon as you walked in, you went, oh, boy.  Because I prefer you to all the other satellite radios.  Thank you, Mr. Povich.  I can suck up to anybody.  We were just watching some of your program on there, and apparently there was a transsexual guy  who you were doing a DNA test on to see if he was, he, she, whatever, was the father of one of the children 
[02:27:00]  that a woman on there was, yeah, you're saying, come on, it's your show, though.  Maury, it's your show.  Ever since I became 70, I'm lost.  You just don't, you don't even remember your own shows anymore.  Somebody said to me, somebody said to me the other day, well, aren't you going to work to your Bob Barker's age?  I said, come on, screw that.  Come on, take some time to yourself.  Maury, you're 70 now? 
[02:27:30]  Can you imagine?  No fucking way.  You know what my, you know what my.  Yeah.  And guess what?  My wife befriended a comic, and unbeknownst to me, for my 70th birthday, he showed up and performed in my apartment.  In your apartment.  And then what happened?  You know who the comic is?  Rich Voss.  Louis Black.  Louis Black.  No.  All right.  Yeah, Louis is very funny.  And now he has become a great friend of ours. 
[02:28:00]  And so Louis is very, he says, you know, I've done network television, I've performed all over the world, I've done Broadway, and here I am doing Povich's 70th birthday.  Wow, Louis Black, in your house.  How's that?  Not bad, huh?  He's a friend of ours.  I love him.  Did you keep a DNA sample of him?  And by the way, he's also from Connie.  You never know.  He's from Connie in my hometown.  He did be friends.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You never know when you might have to see if he's the father of one of these children. 
[02:28:30]  See here, Laura, she wants to know if, is this woman my dad?  The DNA will tell.  Oh, boy.  Do you watch?  You know, this is the problem.  This is it.  The guy became.  Yeah.  Became something.  Late in life.  Yeah.  Nothing more attractive than a late in life tranny, right?  You know something?  I've watched my show.  You're making me watch my show.  I've never watched my show.  I hate looking at that.  Oh, you don't watch that crap either. 
[02:29:00]  That's good.  What are you doing?  Don't call me.  I see every wart.  I mean, like my son the other day says, Dad, you know, your nose is really big.  Jesus.  I said, thank you very much.  Now I've got to watch.  There's the guy.  That's it.  That's a guy.  That used to be a guy.  That's a guy.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  It's like he's in Twisted Sister.  You want to know the answer?  I can remember the answer.  Is it?  He is.  He is the father.  He is the father.  And then, whoa, I've got to go backstage.  The woman's freaking out.  The daughter is so upset. 
[02:29:30]  Make sure we get a camera in her face.  You know what you've got to do, Maury, to spice it up a little bit?  You know how whenever it is or isn't the father, for some reason, the women react the same  way.  They get up, start screaming, and run backstage, bear traps in that hallway that lead backstage.  And how about this?  I've had one woman do it 12 different times.  12 times she ran backstage.  And what do you, because usually I see you kneel down next to them as they're crying.  And I wonder what you're saying to them at that moment. 
[02:30:00]  Because I'm thinking it's some kind of, you know, it's okay.  We'll get you back out there.  Exactly.  We'll help you.  Is that it?  We'll be glad to help you.  I know this is not the father.  How could you just bust her?  Trust me, not the father.  We'll help you find the father and come back on a future show.  I'm thinking it's a big smile.  Look at that.  You look so compassionate, but I'm thinking to go, get your fucking ass back out in front  of those cameras.  Or I swear to God, you're going to bleed.  Smile, you bitch.  We have your name on the contract. 
[02:30:30]  Hey, hey, you know that week's worth of groceries we got you?  They can just as easily disappear.  We have your kids.  Oh, no, we have your kids.  Jesus.  Maury, you don't really help these people after the cameras turn off, right?  No, we do.  Actually, they give them a box of condoms and a Maury Povich t-shirt.  You penis, stupid.  When you see these women sometimes, they're working on their 50th man to see if it's their 
[02:31:00]  father.  I'm going to rethink about coming on this show.  What?  Maury Povich.  I'm not even going to argue with you.  When it was the two of you, it was fine.  But now you've got three others.  I know.  Well, there are other guests.  We're thrilled.  We've got a legend here.  Also, Maury, I've got to tell you by another 15 minutes, the other thing I love are the  teen whores.  The ones that want to have babies.  Yes.  And have already bedded 50 different guys. 
[02:31:30]  Yes.  At the time they're 14.  The mother is crying out on stage.  Of course.  And then backstage is the camera of the girl doing some kind of a horrid dance in her little  skirt and pointing and talking crass to the mother.  I know.  I look good.  And then they bring them out and the audience boos a prepubescent girl.  With little nubs.  So what happened one time on that theme was I get this call and a guy calls up and he says, 
[02:32:00]  Maury, I said, yes.  He says, this is Larry David.  I said, yeah, right.  Sure.  Goodbye.  I hung up on him.  So he calls back and it's Larry David.  So he has seen these shows of these teenage girls.  And he wanted to be the father of.  He says, I want to use a clip of your show on my opening of one of the seasons on Curb Your  Enthusiasm.  So I said, come on.  So I sent it.  Now I watch the show.  It comes.  Oh, he's in bed.  He and his wife are looking for houses in Beverly Hills.  He's in bed in the hotel and won't leave the bed because he's watching my show. 
[02:32:30]  And finally, the wife says, come on, Larry, get out of there.  Come on.  Come on.  He says, you don't know me.  You don't know me.  As the little girl's going on.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  Effing that.  You know, giving the finger to the audience and Larry's giving the finger to the audience.  You really get like, I like when you also get the drill sergeants and whatnot. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  You like that.  We're going to take you to the Monmouth County Jam and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Because the girls are all full of, you know, piss and vinegar there.  They want to have a baby.  They want to do this.  And then the drill instructors and whatnot come out and just lay into them.  And before you know it, the show's over.  The girls are crying.  They're hugging their moms.  And they don't want to have babies anymore.  That's right.  All in a half hour or an hour.  We're going to send them to baby boot camp.  Baby boot camp.  Where they have to take care of little dolls.  Yeah.  And you just teach them to shake them. 
[02:33:30]  You're ghoulish.  I know.  We do tend to be a bit ghoulish here.  You know, Ann, you're not mentioning our favorite part of the Maury Povich show.  What?  The cotton ball, you know.  Oh, the phobias.  The phobias.  You love the phobias.  The phobias are fantastic.  Maury, we found a phobia girl that, I'm telling you,  we suggest people from Maury Povich's show.  You have one?  Yes.  Jill, come on in here.  Where's Jill?  Where's Jill?  I don't know if we have...  Jill is...  Because I want you to know, Anthony, 
[02:34:00]  it's the return of the cotton ball man.  This sweeps, period.  Oh, boy, because this...  Somebody is scared of cotton.  Do you have this woman?  No, this one...  No, Jill?  Yes.  Yes.  She's petrified.  You want to add it to the show?  Or did he tape it or anything?  I know it.  She freaks out.  And I found out a lot of people are like this.  Not a lot.  That's not Jill.  That's Sam.  I know you...  There's Jill.  Some people confuse him for a woman, but...  How are you?  See, he gains their confidence.  You see that?  He reaches out to my knees and down.  Jill. 
[02:34:30]  Now, Jill.  Jill.  You don't like cotton, do you?  Here's some cotton!  We have this guy who's covered in cotton balls.  Oh, I love the cotton ball man.  Yeah.  You're a sick fuck, Laurie.  And he chases the woman around that's afraid of cotton.  It's a scream.  See, look at Jill.  See?  Look at...  That's a real thing.  Everybody in the audience thinks that it's all fake.  Yeah.  It is not fake.  Now, why don't you like cotton?  They feel terrible.  They feel terrible.  Yeah.  Can you hear it?  Do you think you can hear it if somebody squishes it? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Oh, look.  She's twitching.  She's doing, like, this neck twitch thing.  Huh?  I don't like it, no.  Now, there's got to be a reason.  What happened when you were young?  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  Come on.  What uncle had cotton balls?  Was there somebody stuff you in cotton one time?  See, look at her.  Yeah, she's freaking out.  Look at how sick, Laurie really is.  She is.  Laurie loves it.  Yeah.  That and the pickle lady.  How about the pickle lady?  Oh, the one that didn't like the pickle.  Yes.  Yeah.  That was great. 
[02:35:30]  Wasn't that the one where you came out chasing it with a pickle out your fly?  Laurie would have screamed.  Laurie, talk to Jill about the cotton balls.  Come on, Jill.  Yeah.  Open up.  I want to know.  Is it just the little cotton balls?  I mean, I can't even walk down the cotton aisle at Dwayne Reed.  You can't?  There's a whole cotton aisle.  Oh, the aisle.  Oh, you're at the Piggly Wheelie.  Take it to the Piggly Wheelie.  Take it to the Piggly Wheelie.  Take it to Dwayne Wheelie.  I'm afraid of the aisle.  Cotton aisle.  That wasn't the last time we did this.  By the way, you can come on our show.  You want to come on the show? 
[02:36:00]  And I'll bring the expert on.  On the Morg Lovitz show?  No, thank you.  No?  Jill.  Why not?  Cotton.  Some exposure?  Yeah, you do it for us so we get the quick opening in.  Cotton thrown at you.  That's right.  You'd love it.  We'll have this hypnotist who'll come on.  He'll hypnotize you.  Oh, there you go.  And by the end of the show, you'll be kissing cotton balls.  Yeah, sure, Mort.  I know.  That's really okay.  Is that what your cameraman's nickname is?  I love it.  Cotton balls.  I love this stuff.  That is great.  See, I'm glad because people think it's a joke. 
[02:36:30]  I know.  They think it's an act.  We learn it's not.  When I saw it the first time, I was like, there's no way somebody is this afraid or just has such an aversion to cotton.  And then seeing Jill here, she's freaking out.  She's getting all sweaty, palms and everything, and she does not like cotton.  She's doing the big A twitch with her fingers.  Do you have a little brother?  No.  Do you have an older brother?  I have an older sister.  Did she used to tease you about the cotton?  No.  No?  No. 
[02:37:00]  Because she's afraid of styrofoam, so I would just come back.  She's afraid of styrofoam.  Yeah.  Not to the extent I am.  Their family's scared of packing products.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Did Sea Everett Coop ever go down on you?  You know, he's got that beard.  My friend's like, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham.  That Sea Everett Coop.  Colonel Sanders.  Yeah.  Could have used that one, too.  You need to get cotton balls, so.  Yeah, where are the cotton balls?  Maybe.  Are we running out to try to get them?  No, don't do that.  Because Maury.  Now, don't do that. 
[02:37:30]  Maury's got about 15 minutes left.  What's the matter?  You're very mean.  We can't do it.  We're just.  Oh, God.  We learned it from you, okay?  We learned it from you.  We have another friend of ours, Maury, afraid of bananas.  Oh.  Deathly afraid.  Well, my sister was, my brother used to love bananas.  My sister hated bananas.  And he used to shove a banana up her nose all over.  Oh, no.  Jesus, Maury.  Hey.  Oh, you scared me.  What the hell?  For a second there, Maury. 
[02:38:00]  Wow.  I thought that was going to be one of those old school stories that now it's illegal.  Back then it wasn't.  No, it was fine back in the day.  Maury called bullying.  Maury called building character.  Maury paused perfectly there.  Yes, he certainly did.  We all stopped breathing there.  You are not the father.  You see, you are not the father.  What?  Running backstage.  Maury, your stats are a little weird.  I'm looking at the sheet here.  Yeah.  A national survey conducted last year revealed that 10% of U.S. kids are with the wrong father? 
[02:38:30]  No way.  Wow.  Is that scary?  The wrong father.  The wrong father.  I'm going to tell you this.  I had a friend of mine that lived in Miami.  She's obviously a girl.  And I was like, how many dudes do you think are raising kids that are not theirs?  And she was like, 20, 25%.  And I'll never forget she said that she was like, Al, there's some dirty assholes out there.  Wow.  But they're not knowing it's not their kids?  No, they have no idea.  They're like, this is my son, Rick.  It might even be Rick Jr.  And by the way, the father doesn't know either.  Yeah, he doesn't know. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, Maury, speaking of phobias, we got someone entering the studio that's afraid of salads.  You're going to meet him in five seconds here.  Now, he doesn't want to come in to help my little joke.  Oh, somebody ordered a salad.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Here's the main meal of the day.  What's going on?  Maury, walk us through this.  This is the cotton ball.  Oh, he bought the cotton ball.  We did this bit recently. 
[02:39:30]  But not with Maury Povich in studio.  So, Maury, how do we really horrify someone that's afraid of cotton balls?  Do you just dump them on her head?  No.  Throw them at her?  Just ask her to squish it.  Put her hand in the bag.  Yeah, you squish it.  You did it already.  Put your hand in there.  Go ahead.  Get our mic and put your hand in the bag.  Come on.  She's wringing her hand.  Touch the cotton.  She's putting her hand into the bag.  No, not really.  Now she's pulling it out.  She won't touch it. 
[02:40:00]  What does it feel like?  Put your hand in the bag.  Squish it so it makes that sound in your hand.  Maury, she's perfect for your show.  Look at this.  Actually, she's not phobic enough.  Yeah, she isn't quite phobic enough.  She's not crying.  Put your hand in the bag.  Put your hand in the bag.  Put your hand in the bag.  She tried batting one around a little bit.  That didn't work.  Touch the bottom of the bag.  That's all you need to do.  All the way through.  Just go right through the cotton balls. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, good.  Oh, no.  She's trying to get her hand around the cotton balls by going in the side of the bag, but  it's not quite working.  Don't make us blindfold you.  You know what happens to you?  Maury, what?  This is waterboarding.  What are you guys doing?  This is water boring.  She's not touching you.  I was going to say, Maury, what would you do on your show to ratchet this up a little bit?  Oh, they're all over the place.  Okay.  They're all over the place.  We would have an entire man covered in cotton balls and try to embrace the guest. 
[02:41:00]  And the guest is completely phobic.  And the guest is running everywhere.  Yeah, completely phobic.  Through the audience, out the back door.  That would do it.  Maury, where do you find these people with these phobias?  They find us.  They find you.  And usually it's a daughter or a sibling that bring them on.  And then they say, yeah.  And they say, oh, my gosh, my mother has never taken us to the park because she's afraid  of butterflies or something.  And then you put them in a big room of butterflies. 
[02:41:30]  Exactly.  I love the lamb.  Send Maury to Guantanamo.  Maury would be great down there at Gitmo.  Just have them laugh like that over the intercom system.  Just know another detainee just got it somehow.  Well, we got Jill on the floor now.  She's laying down on the floor.  Oh, and cotton balls will be thrown on you.  For Maury.  Yeah.  Who's for Maury?  Yeah.  Come on, we'll put it.  My coordinating producer wants to see us. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, no.  You're dumping them on her?  Oh, no.  Oh, that's terrible.  That's kind of hot.  I don't know.  Something very sexy about that.  It's like Disney Bukkake.  Oh, look.  She does not like those at all.  Oh, they're on your neck.  Get her on a pinball machine.  Tell us what you know.  Tell us what you know.  Tell us what you know.  We used to have girls doing all kinds of shit naked. 
[02:42:30]  Are you a VC?  Yeah.  Wow, that girl looks angry, Maury.  Oh, yeah.  And look at Snoop Dogg.  What's he doing up there?  That's what happens on the show.  Because the savvy New York audience knows, as soon as I have three chairs out there before  the segment, everybody gets excited.  You know there's going to be a problem.  If it's two chairs and, you know, a guy and a woman, that's, you know, that's okay.  But three means there's a new girlfriend involved.  There's a surprise.  There's the mother of the guy. 
[02:43:00]  There's all kinds of stuff.  Transsexual.  Who knows what's going to happen?  Who usually brings in the young teens?  Is that the mother or something called up?  Yes, it's always the mother.  There's a problem.  It's always the mother.  I can't deal with it anymore.  You should hire him.  Why?  And then, of course, the girl comes in and tells her mother secrets.  It's like, well, you ask the mother, how many times do you think that she's had sex?  Well, I think twice.  The girl comes out and says, you don't know this, Mom.  I've had sex 53 times.  Whoa!  And 22 different guys.  And most of the times are in your bed. 
[02:43:30]  Whoa!  Yeah, whoa!  With mine!  Whoa!  With mine!  And you should work for the Maury Povich Show.  Recruit some teens for the teen shows.  How am I going to do that?  You could be great talent coordinator.  I was in the junior high school.  Maury, I don't understand, though, why isn't there more anger directed at the mother, the  parent, that is doing a horrid job at parenting?  Oh.  You found our Achilles heel. 
[02:44:00]  Because, like, the kid gets booed and mouths off and speaks horribly with the mother.  The mother sits there crying and doesn't smack the kid and go, if you don't shut up, I'm  going to friggin', I'm putting you in a home.  Right.  And they give the kid in a home, in an orphanage.  It's like the 30s.  It's the little rascals again.  And the mother gets off scot-free as the poor victim. 
[02:44:30]  Meanwhile, she's not parenting.  Yeah, but backstage, we try to...  Oh, you're trying to help out?  I'm not going into this, Anthony.  I just want to know.  I'm trying to help the mother.  You do?  Okay.  I'm trying to tell her that, you know, it works both ways.  Yeah.  That there's to blame here.  She's to blame, too.  Maury, think of this, though.  What's that?  Beat the mother with a primordial dwarf.  Take one of those dwarfs by the feet and beat the mother with it.  We haven't had the primordials on for a long time.  I know.  Why?  I know.  I miss them.  Why?  They're angry at you?  I miss them terribly. 
[02:45:00]  And how you treat them, putting them in cupboards and wastebastets?  When you put women in your garbage can or...  Maybe they're a little angry, Maury.  ...in your office drawer could be one of the best Maury shows I've ever seen in my life.  These primordial dwarfs are two feet tall at most.  You did hide-in-seek with the Maury.  And they call...  They have these voices like this.  They talk like this.  Hi, Maury.  And Maury had them hidden in his office.  And they call us shock jocks.  It was fantastic.  You sick-affed Maury.  It was fantastic.  One is on a bookshelf as, like, bookends. 
[02:45:30]  He goes, there you are, Tiffany.  And this little thing...  We've got to show these guys the video.  ...spore off the shelf.  It was fantastic.  Maury.  Maury.  And this is why...  I'll tell you, Maury.  This is why your show is still on the air.  Mm-hmm.  Because it's things like that.  You're doing things that aren't being done on other shows.  You know that we are the second youngest skewing talk show in the country?  Really?  Behind Oprah?  Beyond Oprah?  Our median age is younger than any show...  Wow.  ...except Oprah.  His show's so good, I just got sucked into the episode with the sound down. 
[02:46:00]  I don't know what just happened, but two girls are...  We've got the guy in the studio.  Hey, Ann, I've got to ask Maury, what are you working on in the Maury Povich lab?  The lab?  I know this guy has a lab.  I know.  This one ain't going to work.  We have a new season starting in August, and I just...  I mean, I've told the guys, you've got to come up with something new.  Yeah, come up with some new stuff.  First of all, we're working on our production facility.  Now, this is interesting.  I want to know how this is going to shake out.  You see, NBC owns me and Springer and the Steve Wilkos show. 
[02:46:30]  Owns them all.  Okay.  And we are all moving.  Springer and Wilkos are moving from Chicago, and I'm moving from the city, and we're all  going to be doing the show from Stamford, Connecticut.  Are you kidding me?  Jesus.  Now, I want to know how these three shows are going to play in Stamford.  Why Stamford?  Well, because the state of Connecticut, God bless them, gives NBC or any production facility  to come there with big TV and movie production a 30% tax credit. 
[02:47:00]  A little tax break there.  So that's why we're still in business, and there are no pay cuts.  Ah, okay.  So now, is there going to be a problem like people not coming to big cities?  No, because we will be bussing everybody.  A luxury bus, instead of landing at Kennedy.  We buss them in now, downtown New York.  You do?  You don't fly them in?  Oh, well, the guests we fly in, a lot of our guests are on planes for the first time in 
[02:47:30]  their lives.  I bet they are.  First class airfare?  Well, it's an airfare.  They're not riding in the baggage compartment.  I mean, they're there.  Now, Murray, in a place like Chicago, where those guys are from, in New York City, you've  got a lot of very colorful characters to fill the audience.  Correct.  In Stamford, Connecticut.  That's why we're bussing them in.  You're going to bus in the audience.  Yeah, but they've got people in Stamford that like our show, and Bridgeport, and New Haven, 
[02:48:00]  and places like that.  Hartford.  Hartford, yeah.  Get some guests from Hartford.  The ferry from Wyndham.  It's going to be very interesting to see these three shows.  In this nice, suburban community.  And now, is that going to be in one facility?  In one facility.  Wow.  That studio is going to be going seven days a week.  Wow.  That is going to just be a factory of freaks.  They're going to unleash animals into that suburb. 
[02:48:30]  I call them freaks sometimes, Murray.  I know they're needy people that need your help and everything.  You should send some of them.  If they don't work out on your show, you can ship them over to Steve's show, and he could  beat the crap out of them.  Apparently, that's what he does.  He yells at people.  They just have to stand out and get a chair.  And Jerry has wrestlers on him.  Yeah.  And Jerry just has...  Now, that is a freak show.  He's got the no-legged guy.  The no-legged guy.  I love the no-legged guy.  There was a goat.  There was a goat on his stage, and the audience was chanting, kiss the goat. 
[02:49:00]  Kiss the goat.  I'm like, what happened to this show?  What happened to this show?  And the woman got out of the audience.  Why was the goat there?  I have no idea.  I have no...  Unless it was Jerry.  I was going to say, yeah, the wheels are spinning right now.  Maybe it was Jerry.  It was an actual goat on the stage.  Does Murray do animal stuff?  Like, people that...  It was Jack Hanna.  That's it.  Jack Hanna.  See, you keep it legit.  No, I'm talking about the people that, like, have relationships with them.  Oh, no, no.  We don't do the... 
[02:49:30]  For legit...  For real, these people are out there, Maury.  You've got to find them.  No little girl is going to reveal to her mother that she's been with the goat.  Oh, damn.  Well, maybe not on your show, but we're proud here to...  Exactly.  And we provide the animals.  Anthony, good news.  Warren in Norwalk, Connecticut, writes, there are very ghetto areas in Stanford.  Trust me, he'll have plenty of guests and audience members.  Well, you really need that energetic crowd.  We don't... 
[02:50:00]  Why are you looking at the black guy before you answer this question?  I saw what you just did.  One aspect of the community.  Well, of course not.  We have guests that...  I mean, I know a lot of Wall Streeters like to come down to my show.  Yeah, it's just you need that energy is what you need.  The people that are willing to get up and point at the people on stage and say,  I'm better than you, and here's why.  Warren, white trash or ghetto, which is worse?  Oh, that's a good question.  That's a good question, really.  Look, we cut across all...  See, this is why... 
[02:50:30]  Brilliant way to answer that.  I could never answer that without getting in trouble.  We cut across all...  We're equal opportunity here.  Notice throughout the years that every race, creed, and color has a certain aspect of their  blah, blah, blah.  One man's white trash is another man's ghetto.  Who am I to say...  We should give Maury a choice.  He can either continue the interview or we can waterboard him.  I think he'd prefer the waterboarding.  I don't know why he does this to himself. 
[02:51:00]  Can I get out of here?  Have I used up my welcome, please?  No.  Maury, you never used up your welcome.  Maury.  Maury's like...  But...  Well, it is...  Hold on.  It's terrible that...  Well, it's Sweeps Week.  He should at least promote what's coming up on...  Well, I'll tell you, today, across the country, your favorite teenage girls.  Oh, I love those.  Oh, the teenage out-of-control girls.  Oh, I love the out-of-control teens.  And tomorrow we have paternity.  And on the paternity show, we got a guy who's praying that he's the father... 
[02:51:30]  Oh, really?  ...of his two children because his wife has been cheating on him for some time.  Oh, God.  See, look at it.  It says he'll be devastated if the DNA test proves he's not the father.  And look, he's crying.  Yeah, all those white trash guys have that Larry Bird mustache.  You haven't noticed that?  Like 18 hairs.  You think they're all from French Lick?  Oh, boy. 
[02:52:00]  I don't think he...  Maury, do you remember this one?  Because I think that's the father.  That baby looks just like that kid.  Looks like that...  I can tell you one thing.  That other guy, he does not want to be the father.  No.  No, huh?  And I'll tell you something.  He's put it on her, too.  Did you see that audience shot?  I mean...  Yeah, yeah.  Cuts across all socioeconomic...  It certainly does.  Look at this lovable...  That lovable loser there.  29 grand and 33 grand.  That angry guy fucked her like she'd never been fucked before.  That's why she got pregnant, because she didn't care that there was no condom. 
[02:52:30]  Look at him.  Look at the private pile stare he's got going.  Oh, he's awful.  That fucking snakeskin blue shirt.  He's terrible.  But you know he put it to her good, though.  Oh, boy.  We have the greatest video.  Hand right on the back of her neck.  We have the greatest video production.  You really do.  The crying, the black and white.  Springer doesn't have that stuff, boy.  He doesn't have all those.  No, look at this.  The grainy film look.  The shaky camera.  The black and white.  The close-up on the kid's face.  Look at her eyes.  The scratchy video effect. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, he's in love with that kid, and his heart's about to be broken.  Do you realize how unbelievable it is?  It's like she's literally kissing that girl, and that came out of some other dude's dick.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Jesus.  I mean, I just want to bring it.  Sorry, Maury.  I'm just trying to take it to another level here.  What level?  You raise a good point.  One of the highlights of these particular segments is when they go to the shot of the baby and the father, and the woman is pointing out how they look exactly alike. 
[02:53:30]  And then, of course, the result comes out, and he's not the father.  It's not.  And you are not the father.  What?  And then there's a big problem.  I think what makes those segments is that the first time we ever did the show, the producer's briefing me, and she comes to the end.  She says, so here's the result of the test.  And I went, you know, I don't want to know.  Oh.  So I don't know.  So you don't know either.  I don't know the answers.  And so all along, throughout the years, I don't know anything more than the guest knows or the audience knows. 
[02:54:00]  And I think it was by pure accident.  There's no way on this one.  That's the guy on the left.  It's got to be the other guy.  And this stupid slob here is just going to be devastated.  Are they going to fight, Maury?  Are they going to fight?  No way.  No, this guy wouldn't fight anybody.  He doesn't have an in him.  He looks like young Captain Kangaroo.  Oh, Anthony, I don't know. 
[02:54:30]  But the kid looks just like the other guy.  Oh, this is going to be a bad one.  I think the two fathers look alike.  Yeah, they kind of do.  Maybe they're brothers.  Are they brothers, Maury?  It's been known to happen.  It's been known to happen, of course.  Anything can happen on Maury's show.  Tune in this season.  Oh, we've had that.  Brothers.  Yeah, you've had that.  Oh, and by the way, we've had brothers up there, you know, and the girl doesn't know whether it's one brother or the other brother.  And it was neither brother.  Oh, boy.  All right, let's see. 
[02:55:00]  Maury's got the envelope.  Oh, no, that doesn't look good.  Oh, he was not the father.  Oh, he's shaking.  Now, Maury, what do you do?  You are the father.  Now, that guy is the father.  He doesn't want to be.  This guy's devastated.  During the break.  During the break.  Show my camera in his face.  Of course, he's backstage.  Maury is comforting him.  Did you tell him to man up?  Yeah.  You're walking away from him, Maury.  He goes, I can't be around this wuss.  How did you make him feel better?  What did you say?  Relax.  She's fat. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, God damn it, Jimmy.  You guys are terrible.  No, I'm terrible.  Why would he hug her?  Why would he hug her?  She fucked another guy and has a kid, and this dummy's hugging her.  That's the exact reason why she banged that other guy.  That's cuckold.  He's not going anywhere.  He's in love.  Maury, I am fascinated that you can watch the Maury Povich show with the sound off.  We are learning that today.  You can see just by their reaction what is happening.  They should show this on airplanes.  That's the definition of a good TV show.  Hell yeah. 
[02:56:00]  We don't even need the subtitles on the bottom.  We watch every day during our radio show.  Close caption provided by nobody.  Leno told me he and his writers can't write their monologue every day until they see who the father is.  They told me they see who the father is.  I'm serious.  NFL quarterbacks have told me they won't go on the practice field until they see who the father is.  What are we going to do with Jill?  Are we going to get her on the show, Maury?  Jill, you want to do a cotton ball show?  She's not scared enough.  You've seen the people on Maury's show. 
[02:56:30]  They've got to be petrified.  You've got to be a little.  You've got to emote a little.  You've got to be petrified.  You haven't seen the cotton balls when we shove it down her bra.  I think if Cottonball Man alone just showed up, she'd scare the hell out of her.  Yeah, that could be a little scary, Cottonball Man.  All right, guys, can I get out of here?  Because I'm beginning to die here.  Maury knows why to make a quick exit.  I just Twittered a picture of Maury watching Maury.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, it's really weird.  You did?  It's the first time I've ever been on Twitter.  It's you watching your TV show. 
[02:57:00]  No, it'll be the second time because I sent my picture ten minutes ago.  No, but yours was Al Jackson watching Bill Burr.  Yours was no good.  Maury, guys, thank you.  No, Maury, you can't leave, Maury.  Maury, you've got to give us your sequel.  You've got a solo flex.  What's the deal, dude?  You do not look anywhere near 70.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's going on, Maury?  What's going on?  No work, no work.  Is that what it is?  No work?  Yeah, no work done or anything?  I'm going to play golf right now.  That helps.  Low golf?  Low golf?  What's your handicap?  1.4 now.  It's getting hot.  I mean, I used to be scratch.  No, for real? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  You used to be scratch?  Yeah.  You see his logo?  What does that mean?  Dude, I have no idea.  What does that mean?  That means he's shooting, like, pretty much a 73, 74 every time out.  He should know.  Tiger.  It means if it's a par 5, he gets a 5.  If it's a 4, it's a 4.  He can keep...  Oh, a great golfer.  Yeah, he can...  No, that's solid.  That's great.  Yeah.  Solid.  And you used to be scratch, and it's bumming you out that you're a 1.4?  Are you one of those guys?  Well, I still think I can get better.  That's the beauty of golf.  You always think you can get better.  You still hit a warm ball? 
[02:58:00]  Oh, not anymore.  Probably, oh, 265, maybe 27.  That's a nice drive.  I guess the job done.  Yeah, that's nice.  That's it, kid.  That's his Mopo logo.  I thought he was a chef when he said a 1.4.  A guy wouldn't have...  What would he have that there if he couldn't play golf?  It would look silly.  I've played a lot of senior amateur tournaments around the country.  Oh, yeah?  I've played in the United States Senior Amateur.  Now we're impressed, Maury.  Jesus, let's start golf next time.  Damn impressive.  You ready to play golf with Maury?  I didn't know that.  Opie's actually really good.  Opie, you like golf. 
[02:58:30]  I love it.  I was a caddie for 14 years.  Oh, were you?  I think that's the only other...  My father was a sports writer for the Washington Post for 75 years.  He got his job at the age of 16 because he's a caddie in Maine for the owner of the Post.  He wrote about football plays with leather helmets and shit.  Exactly.  My father covered Red Grange.  Don't mess around.  Wow.  It's the only other thing I ever did was caddie and then radio for the most part.  And that's all he ever did.  A couple of dumb little jobs, but...  And now I'm not that...  I shot an 89 the other day. 
[02:59:00]  I mean, that's about where I'm at.  But that's all right.  That's about where I'm at.  If I break 90, he laughs at you.  I know.  If I break 90, I'm happy.  The great thing about golf is it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad because it's all  about a handicap system and everybody is shooting his particular effort towards par and that's  the way it is.  If I get a few pars and hit one PGA-type shot around, I'm happy.  That's all I want.  I like knocking the ball off the trees.  It makes a nice sound.  That knocking, clunking sound.  Lewis Black is another addicted golfer and I got him lessons with my teacher who's a fellow 
[02:59:30]  named Peter Costas.  Yeah.  And Peter and I have been together for years and Peter's on the CBS broadcast.  He's probably the finest golf teacher in the country.  I couldn't imagine Lewis golfing.  And now Lewis is going out there.  Nice.  I couldn't imagine him with his temper golfing.  Bill has something.  I got a question.  He says fuck after every single show.  Oh, he must.  He must.  Bill has something because we have to get Maury out.  I got a question.  Who do you think he can do more push-ups?  Maury or E-Rock?  Oh, Maury.  I can tell you.  I do not do push-ups.  No?  Come on, Maury.  I'll work out a little bit. 
[03:00:00]  Let Maury go.  Let Maury go.  Let Maury go.  Free Maury.  Congratulations.  Maury, thank you so much.  I'm glad you're not on the terrestrial stuff.  Well, for us, too.  Because you guys, I mean, that pesky money was really annoying.  You can barely talk on that.  You're right.  That's true.  Say hello to your son, of course.  We know you're a fan of the show.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  About 13-year-old.  Yeah.  Wait, he listens to the show?  Well, when I let him.  When he lets him.  Oh, wow.  That's nice.  What he really does is listen to all those guests that you've had on. 
[03:00:30]  He's the only kid in New York City who's a NASCAR country music fan.  Oh, really?  We just went to the Talladega race.  Oh, you saw that one?  You saw the crash?  I think you weren't sitting in that bad section.  It was great.  We were not there.  Damn.  You saw the guy run across the finish line?  Right.  That's hilarious.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it, Tizzy.  Good seeing you again.  Oh, wow.  My back feels good.  Continued success.  My back loosened up. 
[03:01:00]  Opie, I can play.  See?  Now you'll play well today.  Come on, Maury.  Oh, he might hug Jill.  Oh, look.  Come on.  What happened?  Let's take a picture and send it to Kyle.  Oh, there it is.  See?  The comforting end.  There was comforting.  You'll be okay.  You'll be okay, sweetheart.  Take it easy there, Maury.  Maury?  You've got to love Maury.  Now give her the real hug.  We're going to push your cock up against her.  Maury's nose was leaking.  Yeah, it was towards the end.  I was looking for some cleaners.  No.  And I think Maury wears Al Pacino shoes. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  He's 70.  And he's got a 1.4 fucking handicap.  Jesus.  Maury hates me.  Maury's nose hates me.  And he wears a platform.  He's so cute.  I wanted to pick him up and go, aw.  I choose.  Jimmy, you won the Maury Povich tweet.  I tweeted this, too.  Twit off.  Oh, you got the platform, too?  I Twittered a picture of the shoes.  Yeah, those are nice.  Yeah.  I'm thinking the lips.  Who's the father? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Continue success.  Continue success.  Jimmy, this tweet thing is getting out of hand because you won.  I was panicking because I wanted to get my picture up first.  I have the worst shaky picture.  Shaky cam.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to take a break.  I want to be taller than Springer.  He seems pretty tall, though.  He's wearing the shoes.  Exactly.  He's in the shoe.  I'll totally think it is.  He can't get on a ride without his shoes.  He looks fine. 
[03:02:30]  That's what's being on TV is he probably like the 9,000th person came out.  I thought you were taller.  It just gets in your head.  It just gets in your head.  Because he's not even short.  He looks regular.  God damn it.  He has lips.  Wait, what the fuck?  We're supposed to get Tommy Shaw off.  He was wearing high-heeled Timberlands.  And Kevin Cronin.  I was going to say nothing.  I didn't get nothing.  A little strawberry, too.  You want it?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  We're babbling.  We've got to regroup.  Hey, Dr. Michio Kaku was in recently.  Had a great interview with the guy. 
[03:03:00]  And Steve and Derek reworked the interview and came up with this.  More with Bill Burr and Al Jackson in just a bit.  Three, two, one.  This is theoretical physicist, Dr. Michio Kaku.  And you are, what are you, you are?  Henry C. Matt, professor of theoretical physics is the official title.  This is Opie and Anthony.  And this is Dr. Kaku on the Opie and Anthony show.  What is antimatter?  100% efficiency.  Now, a hydrogen bomb is 1% efficient. 
[03:03:30]  I know because my friends work on this thing.  My friends drink.  What is the M theory mathematically?  It's the theory of membranes that vibrate in 11-dimensional hyperspace.  Holy shit.  I knew that, but I was asking for the audience.  What about cell phones?  What about cell phones?  What are they going to become?  Many futurists believe that the future will look like a Disney movie.  For example, the magic mirror.  You go up to it and say mirror, mirror on the wall.  And it answers any question you want.  That's how he has to talk to us. 
[03:04:00]  That's what we were joking about.  Here's two physicists talking.  What?  I don't understand a word he's saying.  How dumb do you think we really are?  Let's go back to high school.  If this was a lunch table, would you sit with us?  I think twice.  This is theoretical physicist Michio Kaku.  And even I can't explain how bad this show is.  Having a good time today. 
[03:04:30]  We got Bill Burr in studio.  He'll be in and out all week, which is good news.  He lives in L.A., which sucks because we love Bill on the show.  But when he comes back east, he does the show.  What, Caroline's this weekend, Bill?  Yep.  Also, people are saying you've got to check out the Bill Burr podcast on Mondays.  BillBurr.com.  Yeah, Monday morning podcast.  I updated it.  I actually have a microphone, a little mixer, sound quality.  I'm a nerd.  I'm like Ted Kaczynski.  Wow.  You better not brag because you've got to see what he set up.  I know.  He's probably way beyond me. 
[03:05:00]  But I'm actually so bad at computers.  I'm excited I can actually make like an MP3 now.  That is cool.  No, that's good.  That is good.  Two clicks of the mouse.  Like I did not.  It's literally create MP3.  And you click on it like, I did it.  Hey.  I'm tech savvy.  Yeah.  Caroline's is working on my 800 number and running into my house so I could take calls.  Oh, out there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I built the whole studio in my basement.  You know who's doing something like that?  I don't know if you said Adam Carolla. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He got hosed the same way out there.  And he just said, oh, yeah, go fuck yourself.  And he went on the internet.  Yep.  And all his fans went with him.  I'm on like the same server as he is.  Very nice.  I got to check that out.  What is that on?  It's on a mogulist.  Nice and easy to remember and spell.  Mogulist?  I'm going to try.  M-O-G-U-L-I-S-T.  We got titties.  Hi, girl.  No, come on in.  Yeah, come on in.  What are you doing?  For a second.  Just say hi for a second.  Titty Parker came back.  I'm going to get them.  I don't see that.  Hey.  You can't tease us with a titty pressed against the glass. 
[03:06:00]  You know what's so great is the unexpected titty.  Like if I look at porno, I could fall asleep to a titty.  And then the fact that that just happened, I got all excited.  Like I was 12 again.  Like, oh my God.  Titties against the fucking glass.  I'm doing radio and all of a sudden there's a titty.  That was a tease by that Taya Parker.  She said next time she comes in here, Anna, because I saw her in the lobby, she's going  to bring in a shit picture, which is very good news.  Oh, wow.  These guys were in her logs?  Yeah, well, these guys weren't here yesterday.  Everyone was showing Taya Parker their best shit picture. 
[03:06:30]  Yep.  Picture.  Yes.  And also Al Jackson in the studio playing Funny Bone.  Funny Bone and Hartford all weekend.  In Hartford, Connecticut.  Hartford.  What do you guys think of Maury Povich?  He looks good for 70.  Cool as hell.  No, he looks good.  He looks unbelievable.  I love how people go, he looks good for, and then you have the age.  He looks good for 58.  Yes.  For 56, you're not buying it.  Baba.  Oh, my God.  I said, what's your own?  Jesus, I almost smelt that.  He just showed me a picture of, like, how come your shit doesn't curl around like a normal 
[03:07:00]  person?  Because it goes right from my fucking, it begins digesting in my throat.  It's like a mealworm.  It goes straight on it all.  I think I had a parasite.  My shit had a hat on it.  That's the latest trend, Bill.  You've got to take pictures of your duties.  You've got straight duties.  And you get your best one, and you brag, and you show everybody.  Bobby Kelly had an amazing fucking shit picture.  It looked like, it looked like somebody shit in the toilet, didn't wipe, and then 20 more 
[03:07:30]  people did the same thing.  Oh, wow.  Over and over again.  There was so much shit.  That's because he ate shit for five years, and now he's eating salads, and it's all coming  out.  It was amazing.  I couldn't believe it.  And then Danny's got a few winners.  Danny is more artistic.  He'll make pretzels, and the letter M. It looks like a brown McDonald's logo.  Yeah, but Danny will do that with his hands.  He'll mold it.  Here comes Danny now. 
[03:08:00]  You've got to see the one, Bill.  Danny, the first person to give himself one of your shit pictures.  You've got to show.  No, no, I don't.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Just the one.  I don't do this.  I don't do this.  I don't do this, Bill.  No, I don't.  I don't do this.  It eats away at your soul.  No, it does.  It does.  Come on, Bill.  Come on, Bill.  You've got to just look at it.  Just a quick look.  I don't like looking at it either.  I don't like looking at it either.  It's more fun than I am.  It's fun.  Look, it's fun.  No, it is.  I know you guys.  I'm not looking at it.  I know you guys.  Jesus.  You don't like that? 
[03:08:30]  You have to look.  That was literally, that was Dairy Queen.  That was soft serve style.  Oh, my.  The whole bottom of the bowl is filled up like dinting more beef stew.  Wait, which one did you show him?  You just go letter?  No, no.  I don't have that one.  It stinks in here.  Yeah, we did that one.  Oh, you did.  I love that one.  He showed me the final scene of the blob.  When they kill it.  You guys, they got very good news.  Very good news.  What?  Kenny's rap song is done.  That's good news?  Yeah.  That's very good news.  Kenny, how did it go? 
[03:09:00]  You and Derek recorded a little something?  I have something unrelated to report.  Uh-oh, what happened?  When Taya just walked by.  Yeah.  She said she rubbed one out to you last night.  Oh, to us?  To you.  To me?  Wow.  Yeah, and Lainey says that they want to have a three-way with you.  Lainey and Taya?  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  What are you doing Saturday?  You're looking over your schedule right now.  Oh, he's a married man.  That's right, Bill. 
[03:09:30]  Just a reminder.  Sinner.  Okay, Kenny.  How did the recording go?  One take, Kenny.  Perfection.  All right.  Let's take a listen to what Derek did with Kenny's talent.  A man of Kenny's intelligence would have trouble walking through a door.  Here's Kenny, everyone.  Print.  Perfect.  We're hoping this sweeps the nation.  Yeah.  It's Kenny, baby.  I hate it already.  She is. 
[03:10:00]  CSK.  Wait, wait.  I hate it already.  That wasn't bad.  Wait, Al likes it.  She is.  If he's about to say CSK, I'm going to fucking throw my water at him.  Oh, I think he is.  He had a little attitude.  I thought Kenny had a little swagger on that.  He really did.  He really did.  Let's get a goof hit.  It's about time in our careers we get a goof hit.  You know, like the Disco Doc or the, uh, what are some of those other novelty songs?  We should get a novelty song.  Who Let the Dogs Out.  Disco Doc.  Yeah, Disco Doc.  Because I Got High. 
[03:10:30]  Remember that one?  Yeah.  Who Let the Dogs Out.  Margarine.  Margarine.  Oh, chocolate right here.  Why don't you pop up, people are suggesting you pop up the screwdriver video.  Shit.  I'm going to need some more of that song.  That's a weird one.  Here we go.  Yeah.  It's Kenny, baby.  Shit.  CSK.  Retard in the house.  In the O&A hizzy. 
[03:11:00]  Uh-oh.  In the serious hizzy.  202, y'all.  Let me tell you something.  Sometimes I rhyme slow.  Sometimes I rhyme slower.  That's because I'm a bro and not a shower.  Chilling with the chick.  Who I hope don't have a dick.  Because if she do, I'll be out of there quick.  Some G's are ballers, some G's are players.  Me, I just want to ball a player.  Six figures don't mean shit to me.  Because it's too many zeros.  All I care about is Opie, my hero.  Not to mention Anthony. 
[03:11:30]  The coolest guy since OPP.  And Jimmy too, who makes a big poo.  And smells his fart because he's got a big heart.  Yeah.  What?  And their names O to the P, to the I, to the E, to the A, to the N, to the D, to the capital  A, to the N, to the T, to the H, to the O, to the N, to the Y, and let's not forget  little J-I-double-M-Y.  Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy. 
[03:12:00]  Big shout out to Primetime, my producer.  Holy mother of God.  I think it has potential.  I liked it.  What about the beatbox line?  I just like when he's almost, he's almost on the beat and then he just messes it up.  Completely screws it up.  It's like, wait, wait, he's almost in.  Ah, geez.  Nah, he missed.  They wanted to keep it to one verse.  Ah, is that it?  Yeah, you were ready to roll.  The old school show business.  Leave him wanting more.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They always leave him wanting more. 
[03:12:30]  People are saying MP3, that shit, right away.  Coke logic.  Yeah, that's a ringtone, yo.  That's good.  Can you put anything you want on iTunes or do you have to go through a bunch of it?  Crap.  I think as long as they approve it.  As long as that's an original beat and all that.  I'm sure it's a production piece, right?  Although we got a guy that does jingles down the hall.  I wonder if he does a little hip-hop shit.  Can you still make a living making jingles?  Yeah, when was the last one even heard a jingle? 
[03:13:00]  I think the Alka-Sesa jingle was the last one.  Yeah.  The mattress one.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How did that one go?  That one, they have those fucking cows singing it in the street.  M-A-T-T-R-E-S, that one.  Yeah, leave off the last S for saving syphilis.  Syphilis.  One of the fucking rudest things I ever heard was a comedian named Phil Sullivan.  What did Phil say?  It was right after Clapton's son had fallen. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm just telling you what it was.  It was a gig in Jersey, and there was a fucking New York City skyscraper background.  So Phil is on stage, and he's not doing too well, and he points at one of the windows.  And he says, this is the window that Clapton's kid fell out of, and he went, M-A-T-T-R-E-S, leave off the last S for splat.  It was completely uncalled for.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't received well. 
[03:14:00]  They had a problem with it?  Wow, did I laugh.  It was completely uncalled for.  You're laughing.  His ass off, everybody's just horrified.  Am I fucking in my workout pants?  Hey, I wrote down pandemic.  Why?  You wanted to talk about pandemics?  Yeah, the swine flu.  The swine flu.  Which is the bird flu for this year, I guess.  I'm so pro-pandemic.  Oh, you're hoping for it.  Oh, God.  It's the human being's forest fire. 
[03:14:30]  It needs to happen.  Need some cleaning.  We've got to stop.  Yeah, we've got to stop helping people.  Thin the herd.  Thin the herd.  A little bit.  No medicine.  I think the last big one they had, they had a couple things.  Like, you know, 1918 or something, 675,000 people died.  That was a big one.  Influenced.  Oh, can you imagine the fucking traffic the next day, though?  Just cruising.  Cruising to work.  You wouldn't worry about all those dead people after one good commute into work. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, you wouldn't.  Dude, that's what America's about, putting the top down.  Oh, yeah.  Driving in.  Cruising home, yeah.  Yeah, your wife's dressed like a little fucking whore with making some lemonade.  How long before?  Get back to those days.  How long before you forget about the death and destruction?  Oh, yeah.  And how many people do you run into who truly are just inconsiderate assholes?  Yeah.  There'll be a couple of sad ones.  Yeah.  But for the most part, it's just smooth sailing right into Manhattan.  You're on 95 at 6 o'clock on a Friday, cruising.  It could be like the old days. 
[03:15:30]  Hey, you want to go to the Yankee game?  You just walk up and buy a ticket.  Yeah.  As opposed to that's sold out for the year.  Ticket.  Get your program here.  Yeah.  And you buy a program.  You sit down.  Get a good seat.  Apples are a dime again.  Oh, yeah.  Fantastic.  Off the apple cart.  Fantastic.  Oh, I'm just watching this angry teen.  See, it's the sex, the violence, wild teen girls confronted.  This chick looks pretty angry.  Yeah.  When I was teaching, I lived that shit. 
[03:16:00]  Like, I saw 14-year-old girls, and they were loose.  Yeah.  Loosey goose, bro.  Already.  Look at the mothers all crying.  Why don't you do some parenting?  You know, Al was a teacher.  Dude, that's your one.  Oh, yeah?  Did he get kicked out?  I think, well, no.  I told Jim.  I think my first week teaching, I had to take a shit, and the teacher's lounge was blocked  up, so I went to the kids.  There was this girl giving two dudes a blowjob.  Wow.  Four-day teaching.  And doing it well.  Wow.  Well.  You walked in on that?  How long did you watch it?  I was startled.  I actually, my- 
[03:16:30]  Did you use shit with the door open?  I'm like that one senator.  I'm tapping my foot on the side.  I'm next.  I'm next.  Yeah, man.  Wow.  I caught a girl giving an H.J. to a kid during the Florida standardized test.  After the test, she was jacking this kid off in the auditorium.  What the hell?  And I called the mom, and she was not as upset as you would think she would be.  Like, she was just like, well, do I have to come get her?  I had to work safe fucking hard.  Why the fuck would you ever leave that job? 
[03:17:00]  $29,000 a year.  That'll do it.  They'll run you out of it.  You get the whole summer off?  I never understood teachers bitching.  It's like, dude, you get two and a half months.  Right.  You're done by three.  You have no income coming, though.  You got no income at all.  Get a whole bunch of people you can fuck.  Yeah.  There you go.  You got a break.  You get lunch.  Yeah.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  That is something.  Wow.  What the fuck? 
[03:17:30]  I had to work my ass off in school to try to get anything going with girls, and they  fucking just give them blowjobs and handies in the bathroom.  The amount of stuff you can learn on the internet does not stop with learning how to be a whore,  too, you know?  I guess that's what it is.  Isn't that the new thing that the parents are catching them?  Sexting.  Sexting.  It's all about the sexting.  Yeah.  Girls are taking pictures, send to their boyfriend of a week.  And then when the boyfriend ditches them, they fucking take the pictures.  Yeah.  They learn that lesson for the first time. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  God damn.  Dude, the humiliation.  This girl's mother's a little white compared to this girl.  Yep.  Seems like mom had an issue, apparently, with dad at one point.  Yeah.  Be on top of that, though, right?  Come on.  Yeah.  Who ain't fucking that, right?  Yeah, well, the girl in the pink's going to be hot if she stays on the right course.  She's a wild teen.  The two yellow ones, they're going to be a problem.  Right there, right?  Her name is Geneva. 
[03:18:30]  Would you?  At least you know the father named her.  Your white mother did not name her Geneva.  No.  No.  Well, the mother's just sitting there going, oh, what did I do?  What did I do?  Exactly.  My daughter's a whore.  What a fucking thing.  There's got to be, at some point, when you just, you're in the car, you turn the radio down, and you're like, my daughter's a whore.  Yeah.  I fucked up.  You've got to have it.  Just hit it towards the pole.  Can I go back to the Bill Burr podcast?  Because now people are downloading the Bill Burr podcast, and they're not happy with you. 
[03:19:00]  Why?  I will read straight dicks, instant feedback.  I just downloaded Bill Burr's podcast off of iTunes.  Could you make the files any bigger, Bill?  It took 10 minutes to download 61 megs for an MP3.  That doesn't mean anything to me.  I run my mouth for 50 minutes.  They're free.  You can listen to it for free on my MySpace page.  I think they want you to kind of, like, squish the file a little bit.  It takes 10 minutes to download 61 megs.  Do you realize how spoiled this generation of fucking people are? 
[03:19:30]  They get mad when they have to pay for shit, and it takes another five minutes.  Do these fuckers understand how long it used to take to get one lousy picture on your computer?  I know, back in the old days.  You slowly see it being revealed.  Whatever, it's not worth downloading anyways, you dumb fuck.  You're going to get mad at me for the second time when you listen to it.  I'm charging for my new podcast.  I'm not fucking giving it out.  It's $400 for my one-hour podcast.  It's a nice, quick file to download.  Yep, $400 per episode. 
[03:20:00]  I think we're going to do one more thing before we get these guys out of here.  The car warranty scam.  I'm so fucking sick of those calls.  I get waking up by them.  Bill, you don't get them?  What are they?  The car warranty, the warranty on your car is up.  Oh, that call?  You don't get these?  Oh, yeah, no, I love those calls.  You just start interrogating them.  How'd you get this information?  Who are you?  And then they start panicking, and then they get off the phone.  And they have nothing.  They kind of laugh at you.  By the way, best way to get out of it, my advice was true.  I have not gotten one call. 
[03:20:30]  Tell them the person they're looking for died.  Don't be angry.  Don't yell, die, cunt.  That's what you want to yell.  Well, I'm like, oh, he died.  They're expecting the die, cunt.  Yeah, of course.  So you're going to hit him with something else.  So he passed away.  He did it live on our show.  I did it on the show, and not one call since then.  That's awesome.  Well, we speak to an animal, that's what's written here, who worked for one of these companies.  They're out there.  They've got your number.  And they're dialing it over and over again. 
[03:21:00]  You are still eligible to reactivate warranty coverage.  This is the final call before we close the file.  Press 1 to speak with a representative now about your vehicle.  Press 1, and the recording sends you to someone selling an extended car warranty.  Someone like Keith Evans.  All the thing we're doing, and God is my witness, all the thing we're doing, man, is lying.  Keith worked for VP Marketing in Smyrna, one of the many extended warranty telemarketing companies around the country,  using a computer to randomly call cell phones and home phones. 
[03:21:30]  He spent less than a month here, eventually fired for violating company policies, a charge he denies.  In his complaint to the Better Business Bureau,  Keith says the company scares customers into buying expensive car warranties.  Is it true the car warranty is about to run out?  Now, this is the icing on the cake.  We don't know.  We have no idea of knowing.  Why does the government just go, look? 
[03:22:00]  Enough.  Yeah, that's great.  Enough, you fuckers.  We don't know.  That's the icing on the cake.  I thought he was going to say something really profound.  Yeah, that's like, he really said to his icing on the cake.  We don't.  It could be.  We could be right.  We could be wrong.  No idea.  Well, some people don't even have a warranty on their car when these people call.  Oh, I know.  They don't.  But I want to know where they get the information from.  They couldn't just randomly be calling.  Random calls.  Because people with no cars have been called.  I've heard from people that don't even own cars.  Oh, yeah.  I've gotten calls from these people. 
[03:22:30]  My apologies to GM then for the 30 messages I left you.  But if they don't know, how do they sell you an extended warranty for your car?  Well, according to many former employees, customers are tricked into giving up specific information about their car.  The make, the model, even the vehicle identification number.  And if customers don't fall for that.  They used to say, bang on them.  Hang up the phone.  Bang on them.  Yep.  So how much banging went on in that room?  Nakia Hill and Jessica Phillips both left BP Marketing over pay issues. 
[03:23:00]  One fired, the other quit.  They say the company, also known as Safe Ride Warranty, does not solicit in Georgia.  According to their BBB complaints, the two friends say their bosses routinely ignore the do not call list.  They were being called again.  They were being called again, sometimes the same day.  Again.  Even though you supposedly put them on the do not call list.  Mm-hmm.  And they'll go off.  I'm going to tell you, right?  Now, I don't even call my house this many times. 
[03:23:30]  I like when they go, well, yeah, I'm sorry.  So it takes, you know, 14 business days for that to go through the file.  Yeah, why, yeah.  That's amazing.  When I owe you money, somehow that file goes right through.  Yeah, it goes right through the top, right?  Yeah.  Fucking file.  Buy an extended car warranty from a telemarketer, and the BBB says you could be spending more than $2,000,  sometimes with rules limiting where you can actually get your car repaired.  Generally, we're seeing a lot of conditions associated with it that really bring in the question, 
[03:24:00]  are these extended warranties really worth the value that are being placed on them?  This is not legitimate news.  So says the man behind the Smyrna company making those calls.  We caught up with Jason Iyer as he headed toward one of the luxury cars he drives to work.  I'm not interested.  How about the warranty?  Can you talk to me about that?  Is it worth the money that you're charging?  He's really not interested.  I want to make sure you understand that people are getting really ticked off with companies like yours.  Not just yours, but companies like yours. 
[03:24:30]  What are we doing exactly wrong that you're saying we're doing wrong?  You're calling people over and over again with these...  Is that your act when you know that 100%?  Is that what you read?  No, it's totally read.  I've talked to people who've received calls.  I like that guy.  He's got balls.  Jason Iyer, his name is?  Yeah.  He sounds like he's angry.  Yes, Iyer.  Wordplay jokes.  Just total denial.  Wordplay.  How do you know?  That's what I'm doing.  How do you know?  Did you read it?  No, we fucking just know it. 
[03:25:00]  He's like that 60 minutes fucking whoopee cushion sketch on SNL.  Yeah.  Good call.  Good one.  Good one.  When somebody says, take me off your list, you're supposed to take them off the list as part of the do not call wall.  You know that.  If that's what happens, if that's exactly what you're saying has happened, sure.  You guys call people and say the warranty's about to run out.  And so I'm wondering if the warranty's about to run out on that car.  Well, you know, I haven't checked it.  Maybe you, you probably already know, don't you?  You guys seem to know, because you're telling people.  Let's see. 
[03:25:30]  Get your facts together.  This guy's going to follow the facts.  He's got every bit, every fact is right in front of him.  Yeah.  Oh, this motherfucker.  Is that what you're doing?  Well, I guess if you're saying it, then I guess that is what I'm doing, because evidently you know everything.  What?  I hate that snot.  The guy's turned it right around on him.  He's great.  He's practiced this a few times, getting ready for this moment.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Have you talked on a phone call?  Well, here's a fact.  VK Marketing had a sister company called VersaDebt, which offered a lower consumer's credit card interest rates for a fee. 
[03:26:00]  Last month, VersaDebt agreed to pay a $300,000 fine to the state of Missouri for violating the do not call list there.  Good.  Oops.  $300,000.  That's a lot of money.  He probably made quite a bit of money on it.  Jason.  Who?  But off of who?  Who the fuck is actually going?  Idiots.  I'll buy it.  Okay.  My call warranty?  Like fucking old fogies.  Old fogie. 
[03:26:30]  I think he's like...  Yeah, that's who you explain.  All their money.  Yeah.  The greatest generation.  It's not so great when they're sniffing out bullshit.  You're fucking right, man.  Stormed the beaches of Normandy, but couldn't handle a simple bullshit telemarketing call.  Well, if that's the way you're saying it is, it must be the way it is.  But it's not even the way I got called.  It's going to run out, why I ought to...  You got a lot of moxie there, kid.  Congratulations, sir. 
[03:27:00]  You got the 12-year warranty.  23 skidoo.  I can't believe it.  Send us everything you've worked for your entire life in an envelope in cash.  Okay.  All right.  Morons.  As long as I get my warranty.  But it's the black guy that was talking first and when it was scamming him.  Like, that guy's not too good with words.  And he's like, hey, let me tell you something, man.  Your car insurance, bruh.  Let me tell you, bruh.  Hey, hey, son.  I'm saying no.  It's not even the white guy scamming it with the black... 
[03:27:30]  Hey, you went on the icing on cake?  We got you, babe.  All right.  How do you know the warranty has run out?  We don't.  We don't know.  And the other guy is just like, well, that's what you say.  That's what you thought.  Dude, any time they show those people on TV who get caught, it's always old people.  Yeah.  They fall for that email.  Oh, all the time.  I am the cousin of a prince.  And I have $8 million, but you have to send this?  Yeah.  They kept asking me for $10,000 for the million dollars. 
[03:28:00]  So I sent it, but never got the million dollars.  My favorite is the young girl that befriends the old codger, marries him, and then takes  him for a while.  Oh, well, that's always a fun one.  You've got to think there's some happiness in that guy's head, even when he realizes that  it's all been a scam.  When he realizes he could have saved $700,000 just getting a call, girl.  Yeah, just go to the bunny ranch.  They fall for the dumbest shit. 
[03:28:30]  There's that fucking one with the envelope of money or the lottery ticket one.  Yeah, like, did those scams not exist in the 20s?  There weren't women trying to hook up with old guys?  Yeah.  It's that.  You know what I see all the time?  Like, when I go to Starbucks, I don't know if you guys see this, like, the Pyramids  games, and, like, they'll get, like, a young 18-year-old kid, and they're like, hey,  you need to get your buddies to join.  You give us $500, when they join, we'll give you $250, and then when they get somebody to  sign up, you get another $100.  Yeah.  And, like, you see, like, a 16-year-old kid, like, I get $500 for nothing. 
[03:29:00]  It's just like, I just want to walk over there, like, get away from it.  They do that in Starbucks?  Yeah, because they have to, they do it in Starbucks, and they do it a lot in public libraries and  in bookstores, because they need the place to look legitimate, like, hey, you know, this  is a business I'm running here.  And I see it in Starbucks all the time.  Running a business out of Starbucks.  Yeah, the business is Starbucks.  When you're 16, you're like, he's got a laptop.  He's got a laptop.  I met him in a library.  He seemed legitimate.  He steps out one of those London fog raincoats. 
[03:29:30]  They always got the same open mind.  Yeah, and so you don't want, do you want to make some extra money?  Some residual income, they got some, that's how you'd make money.  Certainly.  Yeah, but you got to think, who goes into Starbucks?  I mean, it's mostly drones.  Yeah.  You know, those cubicle fucking people, and it's just, you know, they haven't really,  I don't know, I'm really shitting on probably 90% of the audience right now.  I just don't know how you end up in those things.  I really got a problem with cubicles.  It's just a lot of people falling for me.  When I was, I was in El Paso last week, and I saw, like, one of those pyramid schemes  that rented out a conference room, and they were, they were a bunch of, you know, young 
[03:30:00]  kids in there in effing jerseys and shit, you know what I'm saying?  Like, like, I'm like, look around you.  Do these people look like they're business people?  Like, just that would be my initial thing.  Like, why am I in the room with these morons?  Yeah, moose is usually a good giveaway that you're getting scanned.  Bunch of sweaty Mexicans, and they're like, we're going to get rich.  Nothing beat that goddamn Amway, though.  Oh, that Amway.  They'd rope you in by saying, hey, I got a business opportunity I'd like to show you 
[03:30:30]  in a meeting.  I'm having a meeting this evening, and I'd like to show you this business proposition.  You're like, what is it?  Can't tell you now.  Can't tell you now.  I, I, it's at a meeting, there'll be other people there, this is legitimate, and, and  then, uh, if you, and then they tell you, if you could, you know, please wear a suit,  because this is a business meeting.  So, you go there, you sit down, other people are in these folding chairs, I'm in someone's  living room.  I actually went for, I actually fell for this. 
[03:31:00]  This is, uh, you know, in a sharkskin suit.  Oh, I feel like a horrible, ill-fitting communion suit.  Slick black hair.  There's a lot of clave and white socks showing in the bottom.  Brown shoes.  He's dressed like a Rockwell painting.  A lot of hope in his eyes.  Yeah, I'm like, what is this meeting?  What is this thing?  And, and, uh, I, I show up, I sit down, there's other people just kind of looking at  each other like, I don't know, and there's a big chalkboard, big blackboard up in the  pot of coffee. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, yeah, whatever you need, some, some Snick snacks laying around, some crackers.  And then, uh, this, uh, guy starts talking like, uh, what was it, business proposition?  And, uh, it's, um, uh, wholesale and retail.  And, uh, this man, many years ago, came up with this, uh, system of, um, varying levels  of, of business.  And, uh, it was a truly the American way.  Right.  Which, on the blackboard. 
[03:32:00]  Then you underline it.  Later, he shortened this to, and then he draws a big line to, whoosh, Amway.  And I'm like, oh my God, I'm at a fucking Amway meeting.  Holy shit.  I was bamboozled right up until it was written in front of my fucking face.  Amway.  I'm like, I'm at a fucking Amway meeting in a bad suit with other people.  And you just heard a collective, oh, like a crone.  And then the person goes, no, no, no, no, now, now.  And they're like, oh, you're there. 
[03:32:30]  And now you gotta listen to this fucker try to, you're gonna be hawking soap and fucking  bad, bad soap, bad cleanser.  And only to the people you love.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, you gotta go to your aunt and be like, do you wanna buy some fucking makeup  remover?  You know?  And then they have testimonials from people that like, you know, you don't sell door to  door.  You, you become a wholesaler of this stuff.  And what you do is, you then sell it to the retailers.  It's like a, like a pyramid thing.  Yeah.  They would go, you know, and then the, the retailer becomes a wholesaler. 
[03:33:00]  And then the retailer's gotta kick the money up to the wholesaler, who then, it's like  a, you know, a capo regime.  Yeah, it's really, it's the mob.  Don.  I am the Don of Amway.  You gotta pay tribute to me.  Fucking Amway, yes.  That's what it is.  You gotta pay tribute.  Like in the old country, except now they do it here with Amway.  And there's, there's like someone in the FBI's office, there's a fucking Amway president  and capos and fucking soldiers. 
[03:33:30]  The soldiers sell the soap.  You guys know what a water scam is?  Water scam?  Is this a water filter?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  Vito on Long Island.  Vito.  Oh, Vito.  Okay.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  Tell him it's water, but it's sand.  Hey, you know about the water scam?  No, it's just some freak, the water filter thing.  Oh, the water filter.  I've heard of that.  Yeah, my cousin, my cousin gets involved in that.  He calls us up.  Oh, you gotta come, you gotta come.  So we get down in the night. 
[03:34:00]  We sit through the meeting.  So we find out, you know, where do you keep these water filters?  This is crazy.  You know, we're gonna get in the vest.  We don't know where they are.  Oh, no, we got in the trailer.  They told us where to clip for his big mistake.  We clipped the trailer.  We took their water filters.  We clipped the trailer.  We clipped the trailer.  We went down and rented a tractor off a guy.  We went and got the trailer.  We were selling them for $15.  Fucking Paulie Walnuts on the phone.  I know.  Fell off the back of a truck.  Hey, yeah. 
[03:34:30]  Motherfucker.  Adam Ferrara got caught up in the water filter thing.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, Adam Ferrara, before his little comedy career there,  got into the water filter thing.  And he came over to the house and he's like,  you gotta get one of these water filters there, Anthony.  I'm like, what do I need that for?  He goes, it filters the water.  I go, I don't need filtered water.  It's great.  Long Island water's fucking fine.  And then I go, by the way, how'd you get into this?  What are you trying to sell and why?  And he's like, ah, just, you know, I'm a businessman now. 
[03:35:00]  I'm making money selling these filters.  I go, how much have you, how many have you sold?  He goes, well, not yet.  But I will.  I go, and then what do you, I go, first of all,  he's the least mechanically inclined person I've ever met in my life.  He stinks at anything mechanical.  And I go, how would you, how would you going to install these for people?  He goes, it's easy.  I go, oh yeah, show me.  I go, show me how you install it.  And he, in the air, made this quarter turn motion with his fingers and goes,  all you do is this and there you go. 
[03:35:30]  I go, what does that mean?  He goes, it taps right into the water line.  That's the beauty of it.  And he just kept saying, that's the beauty of it.  That lasted a week.  They taught him the same.  That's the beauty of it.  That lasted a week.  Yeah, but you know what I love about these stories is both you and Adam just desperately  trying to get the fuck out.  How do I get out and not have to have a real job?  I don't want to work.  I want easy money.  Yeah.  You end up in radio, he ends up a comedian.  And then he was also selling, he came over with binoculars once. 
[03:36:00]  And I go, what are you, a binocular salesman now?  He goes, no, I sell fine optics.  I go, what are you doing?  Sounds like that guy in Green Acres.  I got a genuine.  Mr. Haney.  Here's a nice water filter for you, Mr. Douglas.  Mr. Haney, how do you install it?  That's the beauty of it.  Yeah, me and Adam trying to fucking not work.  Well, I guess we achieved it. 
[03:36:30]  That's the beauty of it.  Sales and show business.  That's it.  The only two things, if you have a felony, no one gives a fuck.  Yeah, that's true.  You can fucking double murder.  They'll have you selling Pontiacs.  And that clipped the truck.  Clipped.  Fuck.  Brilliant.  There you go.  Yeah, Ralph Cramden.  That's pretty much it.  All right.  I tell you, it's a win-win, pal.  Why don't we save some stuff for tomorrow?  Yeah, let's get out of here, because I am fucking exhausted. 
[03:37:00]  Do that red-eye thing.  The red-eye taping, and then for some reason I decided I wanted to watch it.  Yeah, I do it.  If the red-eye is over at fucking, they don't tape until 3 a.m., they tape until like 9.30.  I know.  You could be in bed by 11.  Not when there's a bar in the hotel.  Good point.  I had to down a few.  Take the edge off, that's all.  Terrible.  And then I get back to the room, and I'm just like, I think I'll watch me.  I think I'll watch me.  I know what I said.  What am I going to watch? 
[03:37:30]  Well, I'll be doing it tomorrow, and my letterman airs Friday.  Whatever.  If you want to just catch me on TV, just turn the motherfucker on this week.  It won't be like...  A lot of TV appearances this week.  Hey, somebody wants us to play Cake, War Pigs.  They redid War Pigs.  Who did Cake?  I don't like Cake.  You don't like Cake?  I don't know what Cake does.  I don't like Cake.  I never get to Cake.  Go in the distance?  Yeah, I don't like Cake.  What's one of their stuff?  It's like a...  A rhyme with the Air Force One scare.  Shut up.  No, it's the Scare Force One. 
[03:38:00]  Scare Force One, they call it.  A little longer time of need.  Yeah.  Because if that doesn't rhyme, if they don't give it a hokey thing, we're not going to get it.  No.  God, what a bunch of faggots we are in this country.  We get it.  They should have let someone know they didn't.  Move on.  Joey Vegas.  Show the footage.  Yeah, it's...  They're showing I Am Legend footage up there.  Do you see that?  Oh, my God.  What is that?  I Am Legend...  Why are they showing I Am Legend footage?  Because they're assholes.  This is what it's going to...  This is what the pig flu's going to do.  That is scaring other people.  Why the fuck would they do that?  Because they're the worst.  All right.  But they're just showing that to scare people.  They're trying to start a riot. 
[03:38:30]  Why don't they just show shit from, like, Independence Day.  It's what they do.  There's going to be a bunch of Amway people out there.  It's a big riot.  You know what, dude?  The whole thing's a scam, dude.  Here we go.  Pre-planned speech that can handle no interruptions.  Dude, I figured it out.  It's Air Force One.  Yeah, dude, they know they're doing that, dude.  They don't care.  They tell the mayor, but his whole thing...  Why, Bob?  Damn, I'm just going to keep talking, because one question fucks me up. 
[03:39:00]  Fucking...  What a blithering idiot.  Bob is a blithering idiot.  One question fucking wrecks him.  Can you say blithering one more time?  What's that?  I just need to hear blithering.  That's what he is.  He's a blithering idiot.  That's what Bob does.  He fucking rambles on.  I bet you the whole time he talks, Dane is just on a PSP, fucking politely not listening. 
[03:39:30]  You know what, Dane?  The whole thing's fucked up.  You're going to go to court.  You're going to get your stuff back.  Dude!  How do you think?  I don't know, dude.  I just thought out my speech.  No interaction with people.  You can't ask him a question about it.  You can't.  It fucking stops him in his tracks.  Bob's a fucking...  He's a yammering ninny.  Are you trying to say he blithers too much?  He fucking can't stop.  That fucking dumb, juicy-lipped hole in the middle of his face just opens up and shit  tumbles out of it.  Bob is as stupid as you can possibly be. 
[03:40:00]  And still walk on two fucking legs.  I'm telling you, dude.  The whole thing.  They're going to trace it.  But what about the plane?  Like, who...  Hey, you know what, dude?  You know what, dude?  You just fucking...  He has no idea.  That's his home base.  Dude.  Just centers him.  The plane...  Because they got that thing, dude.  It's all worked out, man.  You know, dude.  They got two planes.  The mayor knew.  They want people to leave. 
[03:40:30]  It's the whole thing, dude.  Why would they do that?  There we go.  And he just stops talking like when you unplug the machine?  Yeah.  He just runs out of gas immediately.  Are you saying you can throw him off easy?  That dumb motherfucker.  Try and listen to him talk politics.  It's a fucking...  It's like a day at the movies.  Ask him anything about politics.  What do you think about politics?  Oh, fuck, dude.  The taxes are going to go up, dude.  It's all they're going to do is try to keep on fucking you with your taxes going up.  How much of yours is going to go up? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  He just freezes and makes sense.  Oh, Jesus.  What about the prisoners there in Guantanamo?  Oh, do you know what, dude?  I say waterboard.  What are we supposed to do?  Not waterboard anybody?  I don't understand.  Did you hear, though, that there were some people that knew about it?  Dad, I don't know.  That's blithering, all right.  Oh, he is a goddamn fool. 
[03:41:30]  Holy shit.  I love making fun of Bob.  I can't stop.  My face hurts.  He looks like mini-me.  Now that he lost weight with that stupid bald head.  I'm obsessed with decapitating him.  And ask Bob Kelly about the swine flu, will you, please?  Yeah, what about that swine flu there, Bob?  The whole thing's a scam.  First of all, they named it after me.  Second of all, there's no such thing.  I eat pigs. 
[03:42:00]  But in Mexico, there are dead people.  All right, but in Mexico, yeah.  Fucking Jimmy.  Fucking Jimmy.  Throat hurts.  Oh, my God.  Let's not drop that bit.  Let's bring that bit back.  Why can't they have a character as good as that on SNL, man?  That would be perfect.  Just make them the White House correspondent. 
[03:42:30]  Just ask him a question.  You're a blithering Bob.  So I love that we have something new on him now that he isn't fat.  Oh, I know.  Now that he's not fat, he can just be a blithering idiot.  He's got to find that perfect balance of sort of out of shape and not quite stupid.  And you got one more?  Dad, the thing is, taxes are going to go up, and they're going to keep throwing in all their own shit. 
[03:43:00]  Everybody's got to get their own shit in there.  Nobody cares about what's going to happen.  He's set flat tax.  Yeah, but I am.  Oh, fucking A, man.  He just freezes.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wait.  What happened?  Oh, no.  I hope the phone ain't ringing.  He freezes like the Tin Man when he gets water thrown on him.  Hello?  No, you're just a mean person. 
[03:43:30]  I don't know if this show helps me or hurts me.  Are you listening, Bobby?  I think this show actually helps me not sell tickets.  Who would come see a guy that goes, dude, you know, Obama.  You're just a mean person.  Well, dude, it's not about you.  You don't do it good.  Ask him.  I don't do me good.  No.  It's not about you on stage.  It's just off stage.  On stage, you're fine.  It's off stage where you should be shot.  You think these assholes... 
[03:44:00]  Yes, I'm sorry.  Bob, show them your intelligence.  Talk about politics.  What do you want to know?  I just can't randomly throw my intelligence out on the fucking table.  Of course not.  Who would say it?  Well, how about something that's in the news?  What do you got on the swine flu?  Well, actually, the swine flu is not that big of a deal, to be honest with you.  Most diseases sometimes...  How many people have come down with it?  Well, 60 have died in Mexico. 
[03:44:30]  Nobody's died in America.  More than 60 have died.  You're trying to sound smart.  You're trying too hard.  No, no, absolutely.  More than 60 have died.  Just be quiet.  You'll hear him clicking, Googling.  No one's died in America now, he says.  Yeah, they have in Texas and Dallas.  Yeah.  It's in Vancouver, too.  It's infected.  You can ask that.  How many people in Mexico have died?  I like how he's really trying to keep his voice low right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, what's going on here?  Let me tell you about the swine flu. 
[03:45:00]  The swine flu.  He'll get mad.  All right, dude.  When Bobby Hurst is at home, here's what will happen.  He'll hold in a shit while sipping a coffee and smoking a cigarette, and the dogs just fucking  feign interest.  Poor Diva and Kelby have to listen to him.  You know what, dude?  I'm telling you, you're going to go to court.  You're going to get all your shit back.  There's not going to be any problems.  Yeah, but do you think that will be...  Why don't you...  It's just, you know, it just hurts my feelings. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, dude, you know what the problem is, dude?  You're being too smarmy.  You're getting all caught up in your thing.  Smarmy.  How am I being smarmy?  Because you just...  I don't like that you added a new thing to it, you fucking asshole.  It's brand new and hysterical.  It sure is.  Smar.  I don't know how to do that.  No, but that's you just running out of steam talking.  You just stop in mid-sentence.  Like, you just freeze with your hands up in the air. 
[03:46:00]  I'm not painting you well, Bob.  I have nothing bad to say about you, Jim.  And as a human being on and off stage, you're just an amazing...  Bobby is actually on the road with Dane now doing fucking arenas.  It's great.  Bobby is going to be making some good cash.  Yeah.  Remember that hockey trip I took?  I was telling you, I went up to like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Dane, I think, is playing all of those places. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Dane plays the fucking gigs, like, places I go to watch other, like...  Yeah, when you look at the Celtics' schedule, it's the same thing.  No, no, no, no.  I just realized that I was making Bill's point.  I was going to say where men play sports, and I'm like, Bill just said that, asshole.  Now, I thought I stepped in your life.  No, I was just, like, holding you for support.  I'm just saying the same thing for no reason.  Hey, Louis Black, I'm just going, are you insane?  What's crazy about this? 
[03:47:00]  Louis now thinks everything is crazy.  Louis, close the window.  What are you, insane?  It'll be hot.  All right, so it's a bad choice.  It's not all that crazy.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Bill Burr, Caroline, all weekend long, 212-757-4100.  Bill Burr will be back.  Al Jackson, fine job on your first appearance on the OPN, sir.
