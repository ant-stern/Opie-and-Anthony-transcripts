<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing one host's debilitating cough and its humorous, albeit crude, implications for their female listeners.  Technical difficulties with Sirius XM access, including app malfunctions and poor customer service, were then aired, followed by a particularly frustrating anecdote about one host's father's struggle to subscribe to their channel on his new car's Sirius unit.  The conversation veered into a scathing critique of the New York Knicks, specifically Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire, using highly offensive language, and a racially insensitive comment about Jeremy Lin's glasses. One host also shared a negative driving experience involving an Asian woman.

The show moved on to Mariano Rivera's injury, playing audio of his post-injury comments.  This led to a discussion of a Heineken commercial, an attempt to identify the Bollywood song used within it, and a foray into music criticism, ranging from Jack White (with a description of a concert video), Willie Nelson's Pearl Jam cover, and generally offensive commentary.  Throughout this segment, numerous offensive racial and gender-based terms were employed.

Comedian Joe DeRosa joined the show in studio.  The hosts played audio of a video featuring a man claiming to psychically manipulate clouds and discussed fake photos of Eminem's daughter.  The Kent State shootings anniversary was mentioned, along with the hosts' opinions on using lethal force against protestors.  Finally, they reminisced about a past appearance by Willie Nelson and his distinctive guitar playing style.

Following this, Joe Rogan called in to the show, detailing his mother's recent major surgery and recovery,  mentioning support from fellow comedians like Colin Quinn and David Tell.  The conversation then took a bizarre turn into a rant about the banking system and the Illuminati, before returning to Rogan’s appreciation for listener support. Anthony's sore throat led to the cancellation of his drinking plans with Rogan.

The hosts then launched into a complaint about the annoyance of pennies, particularly Starbucks' policy, escalating into offensive jokes about assaulting elderly people. This segued into a discussion of Bob Seger's music, criticizing his perceived complaining and romanticized portrayal of touring life.  This evolved into commentary on other musicians, including George Thorogood, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, and other artists deemed "douchey." A caller, Scott, shared anecdotes about working as Bob Seger’s tour photographer, revealing details about Seger's weight and dental problems.

The show continued with further criticism of "story songs" and the perceived artifice in many singer-songwriters' work, targeting artists like Harry Chapin, Jim Croce, and Randy Newman for their perceived melodrama and clichés.  The aging and decline of the band Yes was also discussed, contrasting their past success with their current state.

The next segment featured Joe DeRosa in-studio. They played a song-guessing game, leading to a discussion about the decline of bands like Yes and Chicago versus Rush’s continued success.  The dark themes within seemingly upbeat songs were discussed, citing Tom Jones' "Delilah" as an example.  Other songs mentioned included "Owner of a Lonely Heart," "Heart of the Sunrise," "Billy Don't Be a Hero," and "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia," which spurred debate about Vicki Lawrence's character’s role in the song’s murder. A listener inquired about the similarity between Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and Boston's "More Than a Feeling," with a brief audio comparison played.

The hosts and DeRosa reacted to a video of Jada Pinkett Smith's metal band, Wicked Wisdom, deeming it "terrible" and "embarrassing."  They also revisited the "cloud guy" videos, finding the man’s voice and mannerisms highly entertaining.  The "Tan Mom" news story was discussed, debating whether the mother's actions constituted child abuse. DeRosa repeatedly referenced, and eventually played, a specific scene from *Reservoir Dogs*.  He also shared recordings of their co-host Roland's snoring from a recent sleepover.  DeRosa recounted a workplace altercation, and the segment concluded with a sponsored advertisement for Steven Singer Jewelers and Sherry's Berries, along with a discussion of Mother's Day gifts and a video of a lioness reacting aggressively to a child at a zoo.  A poorly produced advertisement by a colleague was also criticized.

The final segment began with reminiscences about Harvey Keitel and his charisma, transitioning into a discussion of Jay Mohr's impressions, particularly a humorous imitation of Keitel advising on fighting a transsexual.  A caller's question about Ashton Kutcher's Pop Chips commercial (featuring brownface) sparked a discussion about racism in comedy and changing standards of acceptability.  This broadened into a discussion of the Wayans brothers' comedic evolution and the perceived decline in their humor.  The show also covered political cynicism, musical plagiarism (citing Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven," Cheap Trick's "The Flame," Pearl Jam's "Given to Fly," and others), and a video montage of Liam Gallagher's antics. The segment concluded with a commercial for Steven Singer Jewelers, featuring a humorous website address: IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.com.  Joe DeRosa was mentioned as being involved in some capacity but it is not entirely clear if this was on the telephone or in studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Fuck, let's do this.  Morning, everyone.  Oh, boy.  It's got no voice.  Yeah, that's good for a radio show.  It is, though, man.  When one of the hosts can't talk.  No, it's good because the ladies will get a little moister today.  Yeah, ladies.  A little moister?  Yeah.  A little more moist?  This is terrible.  I was hacking like a maniac yesterday and last night. 
[00:00:30]  A lot of coughing going on.  Yeah.  It's the tail end of that cold thing that I had.  Yeah.  Apparently from everybody I've heard that has it, you get this bad cough when it's done.  And that lingers for a while.  And now I was really coughing last night and woke up this morning to Kenny's phone call.  And I literally was trying to tell him, okay, I'm up.  And I was like, oh, my God. 
[00:01:00]  Get him.  Get him.  Get him.  It's terrible.  He's getting me some tea with honey.  You want some tea with honey?  Yeah.  Fucking terrible.  Maybe you got the whooping cough.  That cold comes back.  Then you lose your voice for about three days.  That's great.  Perfect for the weekend.  Yeah.  I don't care about losing my voice for, you know, the weekend.  Yeah.  Because who the fuck talks during the weekend?  Yeah.  This is my job.  My voice is perfect by Monday because I don't say a word during the weekends. 
[00:01:30]  Why bother talking?  There's no one to talk to.  People stare at me and go, why aren't you talking?  We listen to your show every day.  But why aren't you talking now?  Because I talk all week.  And I so badly want to tell them all because I talk a lot.  And I just want to not talk.  Wouldn't it be nice to not talk from 6 to 10 in the morning just to not have to talk?  Really?  Like, we have to talk.  We can't just sit here. 
[00:02:00]  Why not?  We've tried everything else.  Let's just try that.  All right.  I like it.  Let's do that.  We should both go silent and see who breaks the silence from us.  Who fucking gets too nervous and starts chiming in.  Isn't there that stupid thing, though, where, like, if there's no sound, something kicks in?  Yeah, that's why we always, in the past, when we play the silent game, we make slight noises to keep the processing going.  I get more complaints from the fans lately than usual about, like, customer service and how I want to turn on my fucking XM unit. 
[00:02:30]  One guy who was hilarious on Twitter yesterday, he was, like, keeping track of how long he was on hold with customer service.  He's like, I was trying to sign up for your show.  They don't know your show.  They didn't know it.  And then he's like, all right, I'm 20 minutes in.  And then I checked my Twitter a little later.  All right, I'm 40 minutes in, and I'm still on hold trying to get your show. 
[00:03:00]  Why is it so difficult?  Why?  Then another guy's like, I rent the same car all the time at XM.  I can't get your show.  Another guy yesterday, the app.  It would have been nice to listen to Brewers' stories, but it was looping every 10 minutes.  I can't get your show.  Can't hear it.  Can't get it.  The app doesn't work.  Right.  I gave up, so now I found a place where I can listen to your show for free. 
[00:03:30]  Well, yeah, see?  There's a whole thing going on, it seems.  I don't know.  There is word about anything we do, like compromising their content.  Yet, they fucking have people running to other content because they can't fucking get the show.  My dad got a new car and hasn't been allowed to sign up for our channel until after his trial subscription has expired.  What?  He can't listen to the show.  Why?  Who's dad?  Your dad?  Wait. 
[00:04:00]  Your dad has a new car?  It's just his excuse.  He doesn't want to listen to you.  Are you kidding me?  I don't want to listen to you and the fucking Broken Lizard guys.  Oh, God.  They weren't bad.  No, they weren't bad.  You did a very good job.  We would have never had those guys on our show.  No.  That's a fair statement.  That's fair.  Fucking never.  Farva.  But Farva was on.  But you're playing this wrong.  Like, Sam's got those parents that are obsessed with Sam's radio career.  With their boy.  They actually have an XM home unit in the house. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, so they must be losing their minds that your dad can't get the show in his new car.  Why can't he?  He got a new car with a...  Yeah.  But we come with XM.  No, he got a new car with a Sirius unit, and so you have to sign up for the best of XM.  Right.  And then he called, and he was like, I'll pay for the best of XM.  I know I have a free subscription right now.  And they said, no, you can't have it.  Wait, people can't sign up for the service until their trial is over?  Their six-month trial? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, man.  That's what he said.  He said they didn't know.  That would be the craziest thing ever.  Why?  He said, they said, I said, why aren't you listening in the car?  Because a lot of times...  And he said, they won't let me.  Because a lot of people, when the trial is over, they're just lazy.  They kind of like the service.  But at that point, they're like, yeah, I'll get to it eventually.  So if they like it.  Yeah, if you've got a guy a week, two weeks in going, holy fuck, I do like this.  I want to sign up now.  Why isn't that possible?  Or once the trial thing ends, he's just going to say, re-up me whatever I have.  Just re-up the thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not going to think, oh, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, let me now get a special fucking channel thing.  I wonder if that's true.  Your dad's a pretty smart guy.  So I would assume that he tried some workarounds.  Yeah, I mean, he keeps that mustache in check.  He's not, you know.  Well, he certainly does.  That's a job in itself.  I saw Sam's dad recently, and I said, look at you ahead of the trend.  All the fucking Brooklyn hipsters are now.  Not only are they growing mustaches, because the mustache thing has been around a little bit now.  Right.  It's come back a little bit in the last year or two. 
[00:06:00]  But now they're going with the fucking fancy, fucking tippy-tip mustache thing with the wax,  and some of them are putting a little curve in it.  Handlebar mustache.  A little bit.  It's being used in the Heineken ads, I think, right?  The Heineken ads where they have the old-timey fight guy, and he's got the big handlebar mustache.  Do you like that Heineken ad with the...  Where the guy's walking in with the chick?  The music's playing?  It's pretty good.  It's so catchy.  What kind of music is that? 
[00:06:30]  I don't know.  Howdy-hoo.  Does he go, howdy-hoo, howdy-hoo?  I don't know.  That is some kind of wacky fucking music.  And I don't even know what the commercial's for, and I finally, because I was watching the stupid fucking Knicks.  Oh.  And that ad came on, and I was so fucking pissed.  I was like, wait, you know what?  At least I could get something out of this.  What is this for?  And then it's the Heineken logo at the end.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Is that where the guy walks in with the chick?  Yeah, and he's like, he-hoo.  And they're walking through everything, and music's playing.  I can't do the impression, but can you find it really fast? 
[00:07:00]  I don't know which one it is.  I don't know how to search.  It's for Heineken.  It's their latest commercial, and it's very ethnic.  It's like an ethnic, I don't know, like a cool dance club, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he's walking through all cool and shit, and there's music playing.  Very cool.  And I fucking love the music.  You didn't watch the Knicks, right?  No, I did not.  This fucking, fucking team.  So frustrating.  What's what happened?  Well, you got Carmelo Anthony.  Do you really want me to break it down for you for a second? 
[00:07:30]  You don't really.  No, you're talking to the audience.  Carmelo Anthony is a very talented fucking basketball player,  but he doesn't really know how to play with anyone else.  He's a fucking ball hog who sucks in the clutch.  I know the Knicks are out three starters, but he just, I fucking wish they could trade him.  And then you got Stoudemire, this selfish piece of shit that punches the fire extinguisher. 
[00:08:00]  And then, if I was him, I wouldn't show up at Madison Square Garden.  He's sitting on the bench in a sling, knowing everyone knows why he's in a sling.  It wasn't because he was doing battle on the court.  It was because he's a little fucking pissy baby and punched a fire extinguisher,  taking him out of the entire series.  They made him show up.  You think?  Yeah.  It's like, I don't give a shit.  You're showing up.  You're fucking sitting on that bench, and you're going to stay the whole fucking game.  Right, and it was funny because there's a lot of hate for LeBron James,  so there were a lot of asshole chants at the game last night and bullshit when there was a bad call, 
[00:08:30]  which is hilarious because the announcers don't even acknowledge that you can hear clear as day through your TV,  asshole, the whole crowd.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking to myself, why don't the fans at the Garden fucking point at Stoudemire and call him an asshole?  Oh, he was wearing a suit, huh?  Because he guaranteed us that we weren't going to get through this series.  He guaranteed us.  And I guess last night proved that point.  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  Just, they almost looked good in the first half and then fell apart, 
[00:09:00]  and then fucking King James, LeBron James, had 30 points for the night  and just fucking lit it up in the fourth quarter.  He had more points in the fourth quarter than the entire Knicks team.  And then he got Jeremy Lin on the bench with those wacky glasses.  All he needs is the buck teeth to look like a stereotypical Chinaman.  Really?  He's looking like a joke?  You didn't see his glasses yet?  Like a joke Chinaman?  You know those glasses that used to make fun of the Asians by having the horn-rimmed black glasses? 
[00:09:30]  Right, yeah.  He's sort of wearing those.  I'm like, well, you might as well get buck teeth while you're at it.  But we're not supposed to say chink in the armor.  No.  Don't make it so easy for everybody.  That's a...  No, those aren't it.  Yeah, that's...  He was on the bench where there's like, I'm just hanging, I need to see glasses.  I mean, you know, the heat were going to be pretty tough to get past.  Anyway, but fucking Stoudemire.  What a fucking...  They're all selfish fucks. 
[00:10:00]  They don't know how to play with each other.  Oh, boy.  Stoudemire doesn't know how to play with Anthony.  Anthony doesn't know how to play with anybody.  Well, that's true.  So, whatever.  You got the picture of him on the...  No, those aren't.  Well...  That's close.  But you can kind of see, right?  Yeah, you can definitely see.  Don't they look like those Chinese glasses you get?  You used to get them at novelty stores years ago when they were novelty stores.  Right.  Well, that's what he chose to go with.  Some friggin' Asian woman yesterday.  Holy fuck, man. 
[00:10:30]  Where?  On the one home?  On the expressway.  Yeah, I'm driving, and left lane.  Someone was stalled in the left lane, which I never understand in moving traffic.  Right.  Like, it caused a traffic jam because they were stalled.  Of course.  But initially, they must have stalled and just stopped in the left lane.  Now, if you're cruising around at highway speed and you're in the left lane and you have a problem with your vehicle...  You have time to get over.  There's plenty of fucking time and momentum to get the fuck over. 
[00:11:00]  Especially the time when you're on the highway.  Yeah.  There's less cars.  Yeah.  Maybe in rush hour, maybe you can't make that move to the right, but certainly when you were driving.  Of course.  There was nothing going on until they stalled in the left lane.  Right.  So, I never understand that.  So, everyone starts drifting over to the right.  I go all the way to the far right lane, and I'm ready to zip past everybody.  And this Asian woman is in front of me.  She literally jams on the brakes in front of me to let someone else in. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  Like, you don't let someone in when we're all merging over and getting...  But you're just going.  Right.  You know, they'll get in when they can.  She jams on the fucking brakes.  I jam on the brakes.  My backpack on my passenger seat goes flying...  Really?  ...onto the floor.  I was cursing that I pass her, and there she is.  Fucking face.  Most accidents, sir, because these people just don't know what the fuck they're doing.  They don't know how to drive.  I would be all for making it really hard to get a driver's license.  It should be very hard.  I'm serious. 
[00:12:00]  It would be a pain for all of us, because you're like, you just want to get the fuck out of there.  You know, you want to answer...  Ow.  Sorry, that's very...  What are you crazy?  That's fucking blazing hot.  That's like fucking throwing lava down your throat.  Great.  There goes my tongue.  Holy shit.  Ah, we'll get to this.  Oh, my God.  Do the Knicks need new coaching?  I don't understand.  If all the players can't work well together...  Ah, Woodson is a...  I think he's a pretty good coach.  I really do.  He has a pretty damn good record, since he took over for the, you know... 
[00:12:30]  But you can't get these guys to figure out their chemistry?  It's all about Anthony and Stoudemire.  See, the whole thing, if you really want to break it down...  The only reason Jeremy Lin had a chance to become Jeremy Lin, he was just a player before  that, was because, don't forget, Carmelo Anthony was out that entire time.  Right.  Carmelo Anthony was out the entire time when sanity happened.  And then when, you know, he came back in, everyone's like, oh boy, how's this going to  work?  And people were like, I don't know, we'll see. 
[00:13:00]  And guess what?  But it didn't really work as much as it did when Anthony was sitting.  Fuck!  Why did I get into this stupid team again?  Because Linsanity...  Why?  I took a decade off.  It was nice.  Linsanity got you.  Everybody was all caught up in the Linsanity.  You can't blame yourself.  And then Stoudemire's just telling people, no, I'm going to play game four.  And the coach's like, really?  No one has told me.  They had to fucking put his muscle back together.  Yeah, he's not going to be playing anytime soon.  Not only was it a severe cut, they had to work on his muscle. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what that means, but, you know, but your boy is down forever.  Well, that's the big sports story today.  That is way bigger.  Mariano Rivera.  Way bigger.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  We got the audio of him in the locker room, really bummed out.  He's pretty bummed out.  We really need to play that today.  ACL.  Well, as they say all over the news, he's shagging.  He was shagging fly balls in the outfield.  The funny thing is, quickly, so many people today go, why was he doing that? 
[00:14:00]  I guess he's done that his entire career.  I did not know that.  Apparently he would do that the whole time.  You know, his whole career, he liked to fancy himself an outfielder, I guess.  I don't know.  But yeah, he went down and it did not look good.  He fucking broke my knee, man.  Broke my knee, man.  Yeah.  And they're saying very well could be a career ender.  Well, because he said this was going to be his last year, I think.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Or he was strongly hinting this was his last year.  So now he's out for the year, so it's kind of crazy to come back next year.  But he might want to try to come back just because I don't think you want to go out the way he did,  you know, shagging fly balls in Kansas City.  One of the greatest closers of all time and then you end your career like that instead of, you know,  getting the last out in the World Series.  Something, right?  Something huge.  Yeah, that's a shame.  So we got the audio of him in the locker room.  He was bummed out. 
[00:15:00]  I am bummed.  Everyone's playing it today.  We should get that audio from here.  Yeah.  It's a big, big story.  Poor little bastard.  You don't have the Heineken commercial?  Yeah, I don't know which one it is.  It's hard to explain.  Yeah.  But it's got to be on YouTube because it's just a cool-sounding fucking song.  Yeah.  Guy has a thing and he's got one of those thin mustaches.  Thin mustache.  Walking through with the bruds.  He's walking through and everybody knows him and, you know, loves having him there.  I don't even know what ethnicity, excuse me, he is. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I'm not sure what it's supposed to be.  Is he Arabic?  Is he...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe Spanish.  I don't know.  Maybe Spanish.  No idea.  Uh, your father's full of shit, Sam.  It's very easy to do.  Oh, it's an Injun song?  Do what he's trying to do.  Called...  What?  The one with Heidi who?  J-A-A-N...  P-C-H-O-N-H-O?  That's his name.  John P-C-H-O-N-H-O.  What? 
[00:16:00]  You put that on the YouTube.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  P-C...  That's like...  If this guy's wrong, I'm bouncing him out of my room.  Oh, boy, that wouldn't be nice.  I don't need that shit.  There it is, I think.  Let me hear this.  That's it.  This stupid thing is catchy, man.  That was the long version of the song, maybe.  Oh. 
[00:16:30]  Very old school.  Sounds like Quentin Tarantino music.  It's a cool beat.  It is old school.  But updated.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Why are the credits rolling?  Where's the guy, though?  Jan P-C-H-O-N-H-O.  Yeah, this is it.  Jan P-C-H-O-N-H-O.  I don't know why I like this.  Jan P-C-H-O-N-H-O.  What is going on?  Jan P-C-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O-N-H-O.  I like it.  What is this for?  Well, they used part of this for the Heineken commercial.  Actually, this isn't the video of the Heineken commercial.  No. 
[00:17:30]  But they used this music.  And they used that one part.  Heineken.  I like it.  That was pretty cool.  Why is this a movie or something?  I don't know.  It's just the video they made.  Yeah.  There's some Mia Wallace shit going on there. 
[00:18:00]  Some chick dancing.  That's all the vocals right there.  That's all you get.  Yeah.  That's it.  What is that?  Bollywood.  Is that Bolly?  Is that Bollywood?  I think that's some Bollywood.  I bet.  Yeah, this is a scene from the 1966 Bollywood movie, Goom Nam.  Is the song that old?  Goom Nam.  I don't know. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, it's an oldie.  It's fucking catchy as all hell.  Yeah.  It got my attention.  Heidi.  I'm liking weird, new, new to me.  Weird, new, fucking.  Yeah.  I'm finding some cool weirdo music.  Like the Cramps.  I know it's an old band, but fuck, I'm all about the Cramps all week long.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Because that one song we play.  I just don't like the name of the band.  The Cramps.  Yeah, I don't like that.  It hurts.  I don't like Cramps. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, we got it?  Yeah.  So this is what went down with, what's his name there?  Oh.  You were shagging that ball in the outfield.  What happened?  Well, I mean, I grabbed myself between the grass and the dirt.  Wait.  And I couldn't pull my leg up and twisted it.  Holy fuck.  I got some luck.  ACL. 
[00:19:30]  Torn.  Actually.  Broke.  And some meniscus also.  Did you know it was that bad as soon as you did it?  No.  I thought it wasn't that bad.  I mean, I was walking a little bit.  Oh, he's bombing.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's torn.  I have to fix it.  You shag balls have been throughout your entire career.  You've always been known for that in the outfield. 
[00:20:00]  You have to have this happen doing...  I think this broad is scarce.  It's going to get punched.  Oh, yeah.  Extremely frustrating.  Well, I mean, I wouldn't say frustrated.  Because, I mean, I wouldn't...  I don't want it any other way.  I mean, if it's going to happen like that, well, at least happen doing what I love to do.  You know?  And shagging, I love to do.  I mean, if I had to do it all over again, I would do it again.  You love shagging.  Nice.  No hesitation.  That sounds funny to people in England.  Yeah.  Reasons why it happens.  You know?  I mean, yeah.  That's like saying, yeah, I like fucking.  Right. 
[00:20:30]  Really like fucking.  Fucking balls out there.  No.  I just have to...  I probably do that in cricket.  Yeah, yeah.  Just fuck balls.  Yeah, stupid cricket.  I'm fucking some balls out here.  I haven't talked to the doctors yet.  I haven't...  They just wanted to cry.  That's why they figured out.  That's the last question.  And that's the somber voice.  Yeah, they're waiting for the breakdown.  So your career is over.  Yeah.  Tell us how you feel about that.  I've managed in Kansas City.  Pray out it'll be.  Yeah.  Before you were shagging balls.  Shag your balls. 
[00:21:00]  When will you fly back tomorrow?  No.  No.  I want to stay with the team.  You know what I mean?  I just want to be here.  Bum everyone else out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they could all look at you and go, oh.  How about you go home?  So we could watch a reliever come in and give up the fucking game.  It's a not easy situation.  As he has his leg up on something.  Right.  How about you go home?  Popped up on a cooler.  How about you go home and hang out with Stoudemire?  You're bumming everyone out.  Physically and mentally.  Well, I mean, there's more mentally than physically. 
[00:21:30]  You know what I mean?  You're at things like that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You let just the team down.  Well, you didn't do that, sir.  Because Sosa says so.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Is he going?  Oh, they finally got him.  Oh, because he's letting the team down.  Yeah, they finally got him.  They finally got him.  One more question.  Who's going to ask it?  Come on, ask it.  Let's go.  Do you think to yourself, why did this happen or anything like that?  No, I never will second-guess that. 
[00:22:00]  You should ask them about teammates.  Or send the Lord.  You know?  What are the teammates' reactions?  Yeah, back for a reason.  What do they say?  They blew it.  They have to deal with it.  Well, do you think he'll come back to pitch again?  Oh, see, there it is.  At this point, I don't know.  Oh, boy.  At this point, I don't know.  Do you feel you're letting your team down?  Yeah.  We have to face this.  All the guys that depend on you.  And don't come home to rehab and all that kind of stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All that depends on.  Oh, boy. 
[00:22:30]  How do you rehab is going to happen?  Oh, boy.  From there, we see.  Any Ted relatives you want to remember?  Right now, during this.  Just anything they're trying.  Yeah.  Anything.  I love Kansas City with two bad knees.  Yeah.  From 18 years ago, I stayed in Ohio.  with two very bad knees.  Yeah.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player. 
[00:23:00]  What happened to that?  That's a tough dream.  I don't know if that came true, man.  Two bad knees?  No way.  No way.  I thank God that the dream came true.  Oh, ow, ow.  Oh, there's the Heineken commercial.  Yeah, let me go back to that.  Yeah.  Go back to that.  Ten, ten, ten, ten.  Ah, yeah.  A couple going into the club.  Asian people.  This looks like Blade Runner.  Everyone's happy to see him as he walks to the kitchen. 
[00:23:30]  Just want some Heineken.  It's a powerful horn section right there.  Da.  There's Asian people dancing around like crazy.  This is a different commercial.  Is it?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Wow.  The whole Asian team.  He helps the guy with his comb over.  Oh, the magician guy.  The creepy magician. 
[00:24:00]  He's a real hipster, that guy.  Hipsters.  When did the hipster become, like, popular?  I don't know.  After emo.  After emo?  If you're emo now, you're really stupid, right?  Emo is so done.  So done.  Jan peh chan ho.  Jan peh chan ho. 
[00:24:30]  Jan peh chan ho.  Jan peh chan ho.  Jan peh chan ho.  What's he saying?  What does that mean?  Goff.  And it's a different singer.  Yeah.  So it must be a really old song.  It is.  That they're lip syncing to.  E-Rock is claiming that that song was used for our Greg and Tony show jingle.  Oh, really?  That's what he's saying.  All right.  I have it here if you want to hear it.  Oh, wow.  It says a lot of things.  Well, she certainly does.  Maybe. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, sure.  It's close.  Similar horns.  I forgot about that lame fucking.  Yeah, we've done a lot of lame shit.  Dr. Norton.  God, we've done a lot of lame shit.  Oh, yeah.  You have not.  That's not lame.  That's funny.  I cannot believe the temperature of this tea. 
[00:25:30]  It is very hot.  It is crazy fucking, like, run a steam turbine hot.  But they used very hot water to make it.  Yeah, apparently.  You could get a lawsuit going, man.  Oh, yeah.  Spill that shit all over me.  Let's just chill out today, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's just.  I'm game.  How do we do that?  Friday chill show?  Yeah, man.  Let's just chill.  Okay.  Oh, you had something on hipsters?  Yeah, what the fuck is it?  A hipster.  You can't be a hipster if you're a hipster.  What?  Do you know what I'm saying?  You can't acknowledge that you're a hipster. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  No, no.  Everything's got to be very ironic.  Because these people walk around, they're like, oh, they're hipsters.  You're not that hip if you're in the hipster category now.  See, some people dress.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I do.  Some hipsters dress like hipsters to be ironic because they don't think they're a hipster,  but they're dressing like a hipster, not realizing that that makes them a hipster.  Hipsters never want to really acknowledge that they're hipsters.  Hipsters hate hipsters.  But now it's a category.  And they're all in it together.  Hipsters hate fucking hipsters.  So now where are the true hipsters going to go with this? 
[00:26:30]  Hipster.  Because, I mean, you go to Urban Outfitters or something, you could get your hipster fucking  outfit now.  Hipster gear.  Fuck yeah, you can, man.  Well, the true hipster is just run off from emo, which was just a run off from goth.  Gotth.  See, that's why I think I was on it.  You know, by the way, who the godfather of goth was?  Oh, oh, oh.  Anyone?  Oh, oh.  Cow Ripken Jr.  No, not the godfather of goth.  Anyone?  I'm going to go with Bear Grylls.  No, not Bear Grylls.  Loki from Avengers?  No.  It was Edgar Allan Poe. 
[00:27:00]  Edgar Allan Poe.  The godfather of Master Poe.  I like John Cusack.  Yeah, he was good.  I thought it was going to be a real lemon.  Let's just play weird music today.  You want to play some strange tunes?  I don't know.  Have you heard Jack White?  We can play Jack White's little new album.  I love Jack White.  Have you heard the album?  Big fan of Jack White.  I haven't heard the new stuff.  No, it's really good.  Have you heard 16 Saltines?  Is that the hit there? 
[00:27:30]  Why don't we sample that?  Why don't we sample that track?  Let's just sample music today, man.  Yeah.  Know what I want to hear?  For real?  What?  Willie Nelson doing that Pearl Jam song.  What?  Because I went to YouTube, and then, of course, they have to have a whole video with a link  to go somewhere else and buy it.  I'm like, just fucking play the stupid song.  Is it Dr. Gay approved?  Because all things Pearl Jam have to run through Dr. Gay.  I'm hearing really good things about Willie Nelson doing the Pearl Jam song.  Yeah?  Which one does he do?  Just breathe, or?  Hang on.  This is the first song.  Oh, kitten cam. 
[00:28:00]  It's Jack White.  Yeah, this is an advertisement, though.  Oh, boy.  What do you mean?  What does that mean?  This will just be 15 seconds.  It's being used for an American Express commercial?  So you'll actually hear the first part.  Don't we have Jack White in the system?  He said, Eric said, I should look it up.  I don't know.  Oh, but you should look it up.  I think we're having delay issues.  What's he busy doing something?  I think we're having delay issues.  Oh, okay.  What do you mean we're having delay issues?  We've been having some delay issues.  We're just hanging today, man.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  I like Jack White, man.  I love Jack White.  Yeah.  He's the greatest.  Yeah.  I could tell.  Like, I've never heard that song.  But I could tell I would like it.  Why'd you hear this?  Like, that doesn't even really have to grow on me much.  Listen to this.  It's great.  Oh, boy.  Dr. Gay in studio.  No, Jack White.  You can't go wrong with Jack White, White Stripes.  Any band he's kind of done. 
[00:29:00]  The raconteurs, even.  Yeah.  Look at these hot girls.  Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?  Well, every morning, I deliver the news.  Black hat, white shoes, and I've read all over.  She's got a big mailbox. 
[00:29:30]  The raconteurs, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?  Oh, it's a flying Negro child.  What a video.  I'm digging it. 
[00:30:00]  It's awesome.  Definitely liking it.  Absolutely.  I will buy this.  You should watch his web stream show from last week.  Oh, yeah?  At Webster Hall.  Oh, really?  Gary Oldman directed it.  Oh, Gary Oldman directed it.  How did we know about that?  It was everywhere.  It was a very big story.  Oh, I'm out of touch.  I would have went to that show.  The whole thing's on YouTube.  I was waiting for, like, the just haters. 
[00:30:30]  It was like, this song is so generic, it's sad.  Who said that?  Is it really?  Enough of the haters.  Just go find something else.  I don't know, fucking music snobs.  You can't just like something because it sounds cold.  It's impossible.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, it's generic.  This is so fucking something.  And then you ask them what they suggest, and they're just going to suggest whatever generic 
[00:31:00]  thing in their genre they like.  Exactly.  I heard the first Raconteurs album.  I liked that, too.  Absolutely.  I like this.  Jack White and Dave Grohl.  Sorry.  Keeping rock and roll.  Right.  That's pretty good.  Hey, man, you got Anthony Kiedis in there, too.  He's trying to keep rock and roll going.  Yeah, well.  And you got Mick Jagger going to be on SNL.  Oh, man.  Hosting and performing.  That's supposed to be the Rolling Stones, but they're not getting along right now. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Keith Richards mad at the inflatable fucking shit on the stage still.  Yeah, well, they got issues, man.  I mean, because it's the 50th anniversary.  In a perfect world, they're supposed to be rolling out a huge tour this summer, but they're  not getting along.  So now they're going to hopefully delay the 50th anniversary, even though that'll be the  51st anniversary.  If that doesn't tell you they're not getting along, you don't blow off the 50th anniversary.  No.  So, you know, Mick's like, fuck you guys.  I'll go on SNL and do the Stone shit without you. 
[00:32:00]  A lot of cash.  But no one's talking about that.  It's so obvious.  Yeah.  That's so obvious that the Stones were supposed to be doing that spot.  Maybe it'll be a surprise and then the whole band will come out, maybe.  I don't know.  No.  If they can work it out.  Woo!  And everyone will scream.  Yeah.  Maybe Keith Richards.  So cool.  Mm-hmm.  Did you ever see the White Stripes live?  No.  Oh, my God.  No, I have not.  Braggart.  Don't be a braggart.  They're not doing it anymore.  You missed it.  Well, no, but, you know, just seeing Jack White would be, you know, good enough for me. 
[00:32:30]  Amazing.  Yeah.  That was fun when we...  Yes, I did.  Huh?  They're good, right?  That was fun when we did that Raconteurs thing years ago.  We're just hanging out with Jack White.  Yeah.  That was pretty good.  That was really cool.  I remember I texted Sam because Sam was...  He wasn't our intern anymore.  Serious.  But I knew that he was such a Jack White fan.  I was like, hey, we're doing this thing.  We can get you in if you want.  What did he brag about?  That he was, what, with Scorch?  Probably.  Yeah, he's like, nah, I got to do some...  I got to do some pretty fucking... 
[00:33:00]  Not some brain...  Fake emails.  I miss Jack White.  God damn it.  Fake emails.  Not one of our best interviews, by the way.  Jack White's a tough interview.  He's a tough interview.  It's too cool for the room.  It was done through K-Rock.  We were in this weird studio.  And we didn't even know how to pronounce the band.  I remember that.  We were obsessed with...  I even said to Jack White, is it Raconteurs?  Is it Raconteurs?  What is this?  And he goes, I don't know.  Yeah, I'd be very intimidated by Jack White. 
[00:33:30]  He's...  Yeah.  He's a tough interview.  But still.  He's very tall, man.  That's not what would intimidate me.  Oh.  No, that's right.  He is tall.  He's very tall.  Very muscular.  Can we hear the Willie Nelson song?  Yes.  Is it...  I haven't heard it.  Dr. Gay approved?  I haven't heard it.  It might be all hype, but a lot of people are talking about this.  Pearl Jam.  Is he doing Just Breathe?  Is he trying to do a Johnny Cash thing these days?  Have you heard the new Eddie Vedder single?  It's pretty good.  Oh, boy.  No ukulele, right?  No. 
[00:34:00]  I think it's an acoustic guitar.  Is it a Pearl Jam song, or is it an Eddie Vedder song?  No, it's an Eddie Vedder song.  But isn't an Eddie Vedder Pearl Jam?  I mean, those other guys could go, no, man, we're Pearl Jam, too.  We're Pearl Jam, too.  But as soon as you hear that Eddie Vedder voice, that's Pearl Jam.  It's called Skipping.  It's very good.  What are we doing?  Yeah, Willie Nelson, Just Breathe, which is an amazing Pearl Jam song.  Eddie Vedder sure loves it.  Oh, sure.  It sings a lot, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm singing it.  Yeah.  Very tiring. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  A little very country-sounding.  Yes, I understand that every life must end.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be Willie Nelson's Hurt song.  Yeah.  At least it alone, I know someday we must go on.  You know what?  Willie Nelson sounds exactly like he did 20 years ago.  Oh, I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love. 
[00:35:00]  I don't think Willie Nelson is a good singer at all.  You know, I never thought he was.  Wow.  He's not a singer.  He just kind of tells a story.  I like Willie Nelson.  I don't like unique voices like this.  Bob Dylan.  He just sounds like a guy that can't sing very well.  Let's just breathe.  Oh, boy. 
[00:35:30]  I'm not feeling it.  You don't like it?  I'm not feeling it.  Well, you don't like when they slow it down.  You don't like slow songs, really, right?  No, that's not true.  No?  I don't like his voice at all.  It's an amazing song.  He's sounding like fucking...  And he better hits this out of the park every fucking time.  There's a rumor that Pearl Jam and Foo Fighters are playing Central Park this time.  Really?  That's just a rumor.  Oh, shit. 
[00:36:00]  How do we go to that show without having to wait in line for eight hours?  These fucking concerts they put in Central Park because they look close.  You've got to see what happens.  People line up two days in advance just to get into the park.  Because they close down all the entrances.  They just have two places to get in.  Yeah, they put up fences and shit where they corral you all the way to...  Where is it going to be?  On the Great Lawn or whatever?  I would assume.  I mean, it's just a rumor.  Dude, it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  How many movies are going to put this song in? 
[00:36:30]  Huh?  Oh, it's already been in a bunch of movies.  This can definitely go on a movie.  No, Eddie Vedder knew what he was doing.  In the end, this could be one of the greatest Pearl Jam songs ever.  Well.  You don't think so, Eddie?  You could certainly put it in my top ten.  Whoa!  Oh, it's in my top ten.  Wow.  Easy.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Difference of opinion.  Whoa.  Whoa.  What do you think of that, Bobo?  What do you think?  That's a good song.  Did you hear Jack White's other song?  What is it?  Love Interruption. 
[00:37:00]  This is the ad again.  Oh, enough with the ad.  You've heard the song.  Hey, can someone fucking burn this shit for me illegally?  I want to listen to the Jack White stuff.  Buy the album.  Gary Oldman.  Because free is better.  Yeah, free is better always.  It doesn't matter how much money you make, free is better.  Now, go get me a free version of this.  Repetence?  Yes.  So, Gary Oldman directed this to look like an old Nirvana video.  No, Gary Oldman directed the live concert that they did last week.  I thought I saw a director by Gary Oldman.  Well, yeah, that was the ad for the concert.  All right.  Pay attention.  Oh, nice. 
[00:37:30]  Does he got kabuki makeup on?  Yeah, he kind of likes that.  White.  White skin.  Look at the black broad.  I think it's this for yourself.  Yeah?  Where do you find these bitches?  He does a...  He's doing two sets per show on his new tour.  One is completely backed by a female band.  One is backed by an all-male band.  Right on.  He loves the aesthetic.  Where do you find these black bitches to sing for you?  It's like being different. 
[00:38:00]  Springsteen had one.  Yeah, he had black bitches.  Springsteen had a black bitch come out.  And, man, they could sing their fucking hearts out.  They teach them.  I don't know.  Where do you find them, though?  There's got to be some kind of warehouse.  You think?  Yeah.  You think there's, like, a special school for the black bitches?  Yeah.  Black bitches.  Black backup singers.  Yeah.  Do they come from the South or Harlem?  Those are the only two places I'm thinking.  Oh, that's true.  Some kind of choir.  I think there's a lot in Mississippi.  They started in church.  Church?  Singing in the church choir. 
[00:38:30]  Wherever there's a church, there's black bitches.  Yeah, black bitches.  Very cool.  All right, man.  We're just going to chill today, man.  We've definitely got to chill.  We're just chilling.  I can't talk.  It's terrible.  Really?  It's getting worse.  Well, no, I could feel it.  But it's also, like, if I start coughing, it's going to feel like a fucking spear through  my chest.  Really?  Yeah, I could tell.  You know what?  No, we should do.  We should do the cloud guy.  Oh, yeah.  I love the cloud guy.  That'll make me feel better. 
[00:39:00]  I love the cloud guy.  The video has to be on our Facebook page by now, right?  It was up there yesterday.  You've got to go to our Facebook page.  Cludes.  Cludes.  This guy.  Cludes.  And then you should watch his other videos.  Squeers.  Squeers.  Squeers.  Squeers.  Squeers.  Squeers.  This is one of the best finds from Danny in a couple years.  Danny, one of your best finds in years.  I'm sorry?  Cloud guy.  Remember yesterday you weren't totally sure about this? 
[00:39:30]  Cloud guy.  This is one of your best finds in years.  Fucking cloud guy.  And you find good shit all the time.  Well, it was funny because me and Travis were obviously going through and looking at his  other videos.  Yeah.  And I guess some of the fans were doing the same thing, too, because I was getting tweets  about somebody making a hue in the clude.  A hue in the clude.  A hue in the clude.  A hue in the clude.  What was that?  A hue in the clude.  Can we play that one?  Is it worth playing? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, we can play it some more.  I don't want to play too much of it because I don't want it to get tired before Jimmy gets  back.  Because he needs to hear that.  Yeah, he needs to hear it.  Give us one more, though, today.  All right.  I'll definitely grab one.  Because this guy is a great find.  Once again, here's the guy with the clude, squeer, squeer, sheep, squeer.  How do you spell squeer?  It's definitely S-Q-W.  S-Q-W?  S-Q-W?  S-Q-E-E-R.  S-Q-E-E-R.  S-Q-E-E-R.  S-Q-E-E-R.  S-Q-E-E-R. 
[00:40:30]  I don't give a fuck if we played this five times today.  There's a lot of A's in it, though.  I don't know exactly how many.  Here it is again.  Joe DeRosa is going to help us out starting next.  Stay there.  This is a weather control, psychic cloud control video by T-Chase.  See this cloud?

[00:48:30]  I don't know...  I liked it  Eddie Vedder's version is...  Or Pearl Jam's version is...  Willie can't sing  Willie's a terrible singer  Yeah  Were you the one that said that?  Yeah  Yeah, it was like...  It sounds like...  It sounds like your dad...  It sounds like when your dad...  Bingo  Waltzes your mom around the kitchen and is singing to her  Does that really happen?  I don't know  My dad would waltz my mom into the walls  At first, man  At first  Fucking Ro  Your mom's name is Ro, too?  Yeah 
[00:49:00]  That's my mom's name  You got a Ro?  Yeah  No bullshit  I'll tell you when...  My dad's name was Asshole  As far as my mom was concerned  Hey, Asshole  We had Willie Nelson in  When we were at WNEW  It was one of our...  I'm telling you  One of my career highlights  Willie fucking Nelson on our show  He's got that shaky voice thing going  Remember he was just getting high in his tour bus  Oh yeah  Waiting for the interview  And he came up  And he had a guitar  That had a hole in it  He's played it so much  And he refuses to change out his guitar 
[00:49:30]  He would fuck it  He would fuck it  Yeah, he'd fuck his guitar  And he had...  Maybe not  He would fuck it  He had everyone sign this guitar  But he still continued to play it  So like...  Just legendary people that signed this thing  You can't even see their autograph anymore  Because he played right over it  Yeah  Huge hole in it from, you know, playing  Where was the hole?  Right where you fucking strum  Oh, from his pick  Yeah, right below the strings I guess it would be, right?  Richie Havens had that in Woodstock  Oh my god  He was playing freedom, freedom, freedom 
[00:50:00]  And he had a big fucking hole in his guitar  But after that I started getting into Willie Nelson a little bit  Yeah?  He was promoting an album I think with Emmylou Harris at the time maybe  Oh boy  Maybe  And I kind of got into it for a few months  Alright  I mean I respect the man  What about always on my mind  You're always on my mind  It's that like crackly, shaky voice  Yeah  Like Joe said  Just like your dad trying to sing a song 
[00:50:30]  It's terrible  Well he's older than all our dead dads  So...  But he's like just horrible  How old is he now?  He's gotta be pushing 75 easy  Yeah  I think he's about 75  Another commercial  You sure find all the commercials on the YouTube  Oh  That was...  I was gonna say that...  That was Willie Nelson  Yeah  I was...  Yeah that...  That threw me off  What uh...  He does...  It's the Bob Dylan thing  Yeah Bob Dylan's another one  I love Bob Dylan  Cannot sing 
[00:51:00]  Not as much lately cause...  Of his voice  But...  Maybe I...  Maybe I...  Could be out of there  He was old back then  Look how old he is there  How old is this?  He's gotta be 30 years old easy  Is it really?  82?  That's 1980 fucking too  I nailed it 30 years ago  And he already looked old  He always did just look like a scraggly fucking...  He just looks dirty  Like he should have one of those... 
[00:51:30]  A stick with a...  A bandana tied to the end of it on a train car  Yeah...  He looks like...  Yeah he should be playing harmonica  Singing Jimmy Crackhorn  Yeah  Look at his hair though  It's like not...  Not all gray  His beard is gray?  His beard is gray  But it's the hair on his head isn't  Completely gray 30 years ago  He had a gray beard man  But he wants us what?  To throw corn oil in our...  In our tanks or something  To drive around?  Are you kidding?  Is he one of those?  Soy, bean oil  Some kind of oil  Corn oil in your fucking car  I'll put your corn oil 
[00:52:00]  Give me gas  He believes in it  And some of those truck drivers  Are fucking buying into it  When I pound down the fucking gas pedal  I want to fucking launch that vehicle  I don't want to sit there sputtering  With fucking canola oil  Falling out of my exhaust pipe  I think the problem is  There's not a lot of gas stations  That are offering this service  Yeah and I'm pumping that out  What kind of oil?  Come on truck drivers  Help me out  You put some of that shit in your tank  I think it is  It's like corn oil  Is it corn oil?

[00:58:30]  Oh great  Diesel fuel  Made out of corn  Or something like that  And that one  Speaking of money  You know we're getting close to getting rid of the penny finally  Yes  Oh it's about fucking time  Pennies are just annoying  I guess Canada is rolling out their last penny today  Yeah  Canada finally realized  Yeah  The penny's stupid  They're going to phase it out  Out of circulation  Within a few months  And they want to do that in America  But I don't know what they're waiting for  They say it makes  It costs more  Yeah  This is why the government 
[00:59:00]  It fucking drives me nuts  They  It costs more to make the penny  Than what it's worth  Than it's worth yeah  They could  The government can't even figure out how to make the penny cheaper  It's so  Literally make the penny cheaper  That's so dumb  It's so fucking dumb  That tells you a lot about our government  Well stop making it out of fucking copper  Or whatever it's made out of  I don't think it is really  What's it made out of?  Like zinc or some shit  Yeah I don't know  I don't even know it's made  It's like no copper in that anymore  Yeah  Make it out of fucking plastic or paper  Paper  Who gives a shit? 
[00:59:30]  Nobody's going to use it anyway  You know  I get  Yeah  I actually get mad when they give me pennies back at this point  I'm like just round it up  Yeah  I don't give a fuck  Round it down  How about Starbucks?  You're not a Starbucks guy  No  These cunts  A tall coffee at Starbucks in New York City  Uh huh  Is two dollars  And one cent  Are you serious?  And guess what?  Oh boy  Nine out of ten times they won't let you fucking slide for the penny  They won't?  No  What the fuck are they doing? 
[01:00:00]  Give a penny take a penny?  And a lot of times I'll take the penny  Take a penny?  I'll take the penny right out of their fucking tips  And I go here's your fucking penny  Oh man  And they'll look at me and I go trust me  I've put a lot of money in your tip jar over the years  I don't want 99 cents back because I  Because you guys have decided to make it two dollars and a penny  Who does that?  That's fucking ridiculous  That's just  They're fucking with you  Whoever works at Starbucks  You call up right the fuck now and tell me why you do that  Because that's so fucking ridiculous  Exactly  And don't call up  Can I just say? 
[01:00:30]  Oh yes  Don't you fucking call up and say  Oh yes  Don't you fucking call up and say  Hey I just work there  Right  It's not my rule  All Nazis march for Hitler  Yeah  I was  I was in Cleveland and this happened  Just calling orders right  The only thing that was open in Cleveland from 6 in the morning until probably 2 in the afternoon  Is Starbucks in the city  So it's 2 dollars and a penny right?  I'm like  I got  I throw the 2 dollars down  I have the standoff  I wanted the guy to ask for the penny 
[01:01:00]  Oh man  Guess what?  The guy asked for the fucking penny  Really?  And I went  I went are you serious?  And he was a cocksucker motherfucker  So I had to pull another dollar out and then I got the 99 cents  That's always good to have a pocket full of fucking change  A pocket full of 99 cents  These sons of bitch bastards  Oh man  These god damn motherfuckers  Oh man  Fucking ridiculous  And then down to the other picture you fuck  There  You fuck  Leave it there  Just go look at her and talk  So  I don't even understand that you justify 2-0-1 
[01:01:30]  I would rather have it 2-20  Jesus  I would rather pay more  Yeah  I really would  Yeah that's just an asshole fucking thing  2 dollars and a cent  If you  How do you even say that? 2 dollars and a penny?  I don't even  2 dollars and 1 cent  2-0-1 I guess right?  If you run a register and you don't let a guy slide any  I  I say this  You gotta let a guy slide up to 4 cents  Wow  Wow  Yeah easily  That's a bold statement  Easily  If it's 0-4  Once it's 0-5  Then it's like sorry dude 
[01:02:00]  Yeah yeah  Well they're saying it's so  There's more money to leave for a tip  It is true  You're not gonna carry that change  It's a cup of coffee  But you're not gonna carry that change with you  I do  You're gonna take the handful of change  Yeah  And then whip it into their tip cup  You won't necessarily do that with a dollar  And I do tip  But it's more the annoyance of the whole thing  If someone makes me something  I give them a tip  This is  This is  This is  This is  This is a fucking problem man  Okay  Yeah  Jesus  Jesus  Juice joint 
[01:02:30]  Juice joint  You're taking this  This thing for me  So of course  Yeah  Yeah  It's like  Grabbing her change  Or looking for change  So she could pay for it perfectly  Oh god  I'm like  These guys are working for you man  Fucking give up the change  Is there anything worse  Than  Being behind  An old  I mean  Oh my god  For old people  But just being behind an old person  Yeah  Yeah  Paying for something 
[01:03:00]  It's  And just  Their questions  It's unsure  28 cents  But now they have to look through that wallet  That has a million fucking pockets  Oh  Their fucking hands are shaking  Their hands are fucking shaking  Their transparent skin  And blue pulsating veins  Their hands are shaking  They get everything  And then they get it  They pay for it  And you're standing there  Now they're repacking  Their fucking  Giant pocketbook  Slowly putting shit back  Right  It takes forever  The whole transaction's done  And it still takes them forever 
[01:03:30]  Are you like me  Where you get close every time  To knocking the wallet  Right out of their hands  Oh my fucking  I've had  I've had these visions  Oh I've had visions  Of how much a jaw would shatter  Just hitting it  Like imagine an old person jaw  You just come around behind them  Bam  Clock them in the jaw  I want to knock an old purse  Out of their hands  So badly  My fantasy is always  Cause they'll just cut in front of you  Like you owe it to them  Yeah  Like it's my fault  You live to fucking 98  Go fuck yourself  Right  They'll just cut in front of you in line 
[01:04:00]  My fantasy is always  Punching them  Punching them  In the soft part  Of the back of the neck  Oh wow  Jesus  Jesus Christ  You know Jesus Christ  And it just splits open  And I see their brains slide out  Oh yeah  That's why I always remember  Everyone's saying  So there's more change for a tip  But it works  The opposite for me  I'm like  You know what  Out of principle  I'm putting the 99 cents  In my fucking pocket  Period  Sorry  That is a brilliant strategy though  I throw that change into that fucking cup  Every time 
[01:04:30]  I can't stand  Carrying that pocket full of fucking change  And you can't do it anymore  Because you got like your iPhone in there and shit  And you can't fucking just like dump change in with the iPhone  It's gonna scratch up the fucking thing  So you'd rather just get rid of the fucking change  I got a special pocket for my phone  Do ya?  Oh yeah  What pocket is it?  It's my left front pocket  It's my phone pocket  My keys go in my right pocket  You ever make a mistake and put your keys in the room  And you're like  Oh my god  I just trashed my phone screen  The other thing 
[01:05:00]  It costs 3 cents to make a penny  This is what our government does  3 cents  They can't even figure that out  Then how about you get rid of the fucking penny  This country just stinks  Well now we gotta  Jesus  Now we gotta choose between Romney and Obama  Lucky us  Lucky us  Romney or Obama  Just two fucking  Lucky us  Two goofy politician douchebags  Like it's  It's  The way I watch people blindly pledge allegiance to both of those men  Yeah  It annoys 
[01:05:30]  The fuck out of me  Like of all the years  I wish they had some fucking  Redneck fucking third candidate coming in from left field  It's this fucking year  Yeah  Yeah  Just somebody else for me to go  I like that guy  You know what I mean?  Anyone but these two  Anyone but these two  I will vote for fucking Romney though  Because  I just  I have that  Much of an aversion  To Obama  Yeah I understand why people are gonna vote for whoever they vote for but  I don't  I just  But it's a lesser of two evils 
[01:06:00]  This great country of ours  And this is what we got to pick between  It's a dog and pony show  It amazes me  Yeah  Candidates?  Really?  It's a dog and pony show  It's  It's a fucking  I love fucking  It's a fucking  Yeah  They tell you to go fucking vote  What do you do?  You go out and vote?  What do they got in the voting booths?  Cameras  They know where the fuck you were  That's how they fucking do it dude  This is Burr  This is the way he sits there  When he's going on a fucking rant  Oh yeah when he's on one of his rants 
[01:06:30]  He leans way back in his chair  Like  He's pontificating  He's holding court  He's holding court  Yeah  You know Dave  You know the star  You gotta go Joe  No no no no no no  I'll cut you off  I'm sorry  I'm obsessing about the Starbucks thing  So seriously  What you were about to say was way better  I was gonna  Because some asshole now is going  Why don't you just carry pennies around?  I don't know when I'm going to Starbucks to get my two dollars  Why would you carry pennies around?  Why would you carry pennies around?  You fucking idiot  I'll also carry some leeches in my fucking pocket for when I get sick  You fucking 
[01:07:00]  God damn medieval asshole  Didn't you  We're all in agreement that we don't like carrying change  So now I'm gonna leave the house on purpose with change in my pocket?  Yeah  My whole goal throughout the day is to get rid of my change  Get rid of the change  That is the game  If I come home with no change I'm so happy  That sounds like a Seinfeld bit  But it's real  That's all every day is  It's getting rid of your change  But I can't justify giving them all 99 cents  So I take the 99 cents  And then guess what?  I actually give more money to homeless people nowadays 
[01:07:30]  Because of the change issue  Yeah  I'm always emptying whatever I have in my pocket change wise  To the first homeless guy I see  I'll take you a step further  I don't like carrying ones  Really?  I don't fucking like it  It is annoying  I don't like when they build up  No  Then they always build up  You need a few ones to make sure you don't get too many ones back  Yep  Yep  This is very Seinfeld-ish  The ones build up  Because every fucking cunt wants to make sure they get a tip  Yeah  Oh sorry dude 
[01:08:00]  All I have is ones and fives  Really?  Really?  So you get a tip at your fucking Wendy's  You asshole  Yes  Yes  How about when you buy something in a tip atmosphere  And they just assume that you're going to tip  So they like break that 10 down to 10 ones  Yep  That's when I don't tip  I'm like you know what?  Fuck you  Yeah  I know I get a reputation on the show  But I really am  But when they play those games  That's when I fucking chisel them back  And go go fuck yourself  Yeah  I've snapped at guys before  When they start handing me like the 10 ones 
[01:08:30]  I go stop  I'm going to give you a tip  Right  Don't give me all ones right now man  Right don't  Yeah exactly  So fucking irritating man  They do that at the strip clubs too man  Where they do like  You get a beer  Well you need the ones  And then they just  Deal all the ones  Yeah yeah  Cause they know you know  You gotta give it to the ladies  To the ladies  Well  At least in a strip club  I get something out of it  Right  It's like if I tip  I get to come in my pants possibly  Like Roland  Where  Roland made cumzies at the strip club  Did he make cumzies?  Twice 
[01:09:00]  Twice  He came twice  And then wanted to go to another strip club  On the way home  From the strip club  He was taking girls back there  Like crazy in Cleveland  How much did he spend?  Uh  He said like three  Was it 300?  Something like that yeah  Something like that  But it's Cleveland  So he got a lot for money  Cleveland you know  Demanding that much cash  To tell you the truth  Cleveland  That just sounds depressing  Doesn't it?  He must have got full penetration  For that money  So you're living in Cleveland  What are you doing?  Yeah I'm dancing  Right  I was in fucking Peoria, Illinois once 
[01:09:30]  Oof  And actually  I had a great time out there  It's actually a very fun town  Yeah  But I went to a strip club  Yeah  And I remember the lap dances  You know  They were like  To go in the room  It was like 20 bucks  Sure  I'm like that's  How much it is in New York  Fuck yourself  That is true  You know like Peoria  It should be like  It should be 750  There is  You are right  But there is no like  There's no difference  No matter where you are  With strippers  It's gonna be 20 bucks a song  Yeah 
[01:10:00]  Shit like that  It's like when in the old days  When you used to just buy a joint  It was a buck  No matter where the fuck you are  No matter how good or bad the weed was  It was a dollar for a joint  You used to be able to just buy joints?  Oh I remember the kid in school  The guy that would deal the weed  Would have his cigarette pack  And it was full of joints  And he would just open it up  It was a dollar yeah  What do you want  You'd look you'd squeeze  And go like yeah I'll take this one  And you'd give him a buck  I was too scared to smoke pot in high school  Really?  Yeah  I was constantly smoking pot in high school  I was too scared 
[01:10:30]  Constantly  I needed to graduate  And get away from my home life  I couldn't fuck that up  I was terrified of it  I knew 18 was coming  I knew I had a fucking split  And I didn't want to ruin that  By becoming a pothead  Pothead  I was such a pothead  Then when I was free and clear  From my mama  Yeah then I smoked pot in college  Delved  Yeah I was terrified of it  But I was terrified of it for like  I like looked down on it 
[01:11:00]  I was like it's disgusting  That people do that  It's so  Oh I wanted it  It's a drug  Yeah  And then after like  A solid two and a half years  From like my  From like late junior year  All the way through senior year  All the way to the end of my  Freshman year in college  Wow  Of every single person I know smoking it  I was finally like  Finally  I want to try this  And I did  And I was like  Oh my I love you  Okay  I smoked it every day  For like four years after that  Now I see why

Look I went to the midnight premieres of all the  All six Star Wars movies and the  You know shit like that  But I wasn't a Rocky Horror guy  I'm just bringing back a bit from earlier this week  Oh what was  We hated Rocky Horror  We finally admitted it to everybody  It stinks  That it was the most overrated thing  When we were growing up 
[01:12:00]  Terrible  It fucking stinks  Alright so you're on our side  Yeah  Well that's the thing  They know it stinks too  You know I mean that's the whole  That's why people like it though right?  I don't know  I don't know man  Some people get so into it  And they're acting out the parts in front of the screen  It's just embarrassing  Yeah  It's the first time a bad movie got that following isn't it?  Um  Wow yeah  Cold following as they like to say  Cold following  Yeah  But they weren't being ironic  Is that the proper use of ironic there?  Yeah  I think they were  I think they were being ironic 
[01:12:30]  I think so  I think it's like oh it's so cheesy and gaudy that it's great  I think  That we can goof on it to make it more entertaining  They figured out a way to make it more entertaining  We just thought they were all a bunch of fucking assholes  You knew you didn't need to hang out with those people  Actually I just knew  Well you guys would know better than me  I'm talking like  Oh cause we're older?  Yeah  Oh thanks  Yeah that's exactly what I meant  I know  The truth hurts  Yeah  No but I'm saying I'm talking like I was there  Like was it ironic at the time 
[01:13:00]  Or was it really people actually were into it?  No they're still doing it to this day though  I think  You didn't have kids in your high school going to Rocky Horror?  No but dude I lived in Norristown, Pennsylvania  It's like  Yeah it's not  It was massive  Yeah  A lot of people went to that stupid ass shit  I come from a very  Not diverse part of Pennsylvania  It was very  Really?

[01:13:30]  Sort of Guido-y dance club kind of bar  Or like the sports bar  That's it  Jesus  Those are your three choices  It's like there's no  Would everyone get off of the mill on Friday  And go to the bar  Bo  Bo  Bo  Bo  Yeah yeah  Exactly  We did a whole Bob Seger thing the other day  Oh you did?  Oh fuck yeah  Oh yeah come on  What was it?  Night moves talking about how firm those tits were  But we all just made believe he wasn't singing about tits 
[01:14:00]  It was  About the points up high  Bob Seger's  Firm  We realize Bob Seger really doesn't like the fact that he got old  He just reminisces about you know going to the woods and fucking girls  Yeah  When he used to hang out and drive his car  Yeah  Shit like that  Dad he makes it all sound so pained  Like  Yeah yeah  Here I go on the road again  He sings it like he's going on a horse  It's like  Oh is it tough in your air conditioned bus with the wine cellar under it?  Why didn't we do this?  You fucking asshole 
[01:14:30]  You're nailing it  Yeah man  And his fans are like real blue collar guys  Losing their fucking appendages at work  Oh my god  Yeah real tough job he got there Bobby  Oh yeah  Bobby Seger  You know what he hasn't seen home in a while  He's on the road  Yeah it's a tough life man  Yeah it's a tough life man  On the long road  Here I go  Fucking these groupies again  Oh these blow jobs are getting me down  Here I go  A million dollars a night  How about we do the song we're talking about E-Rock 
[01:15:00]  Oh that's great  Please  Yeah E-Rock how about I'll turn the page cause you probably don't know  How about turn the page  Holy shit  Yeah  Metallica's version is awesome  But I still enjoy the original  Just as much  It's an awesome song  It really is  But he is bitching a little too much  Strung out from the road  You're driving 16 hours  Oh it's crazy  It's crazy  But why  Hold on let's break it down  16 hours he's sleeping  He's in his fucking nice bed  But break it down 
[01:15:30]  Why is he driving 16 hours?  For what reason?  To play his music man  To play his music and fuck groupies  And fuck groupies  And have maybe a little fucking pot  He makes it sound like he's fucking trucking pig shit around the country  Right  It's the same old cliches  Is that a woman or a man?  A lot of guys saying like  Hey you look like a chick  Alright he's got the lonesome highway  Yeah listen to the pain fucking vocal  Oh boy this is bad  You think truckers love this song?  The engines dude  He's thinking about his tour bus engines 
[01:16:00]  Yeah  You think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before  Right  Fucking some girl  Right  He's fresh off a fucking  Right he's gonna  Back on his bus  He's gonna have a girl to replace that girl within hours  Yeah  The way they always do  Yeah  When you're riding 16 hours  And there's nothing there to do  Oh he just fucked  Literally  Wash your dick  When you ride 16 hours  Let's rephrase that  When your bus driver's driving you 16 hours 
[01:16:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  And you're kinda bored in the bus  Yeah yeah yeah  You turn on the TV  Oh he's on the road again  That means he's very successful by the way  Yeah  There's a lot of bands that wish they could be on the road again  Live version?  On the stage  Wow  Yeah  I've never heard of that  The live version  Yeah what's this like  I've never heard of that before  Russian-y dance thing under it  Good job live version  There's only two live versions in there  I don't want the live version  There's one from back in 72 and one from live bullet 
[01:17:00]  I think the only version is a live version  Yeah  I think the original version is right  But it's the live version we all know  Yeah yeah  It's a little different I think  Hang on  I got a  I got another great one for this ongoing trashing  Wait we should also  What the fuck is  What's this other song  Just take those old records off the shelf  Old time rock and roll  Just called it old time rock and roll  God  Shut your face Bob Seger  But I'm more obsessed with turn the page 
[01:17:30]  Cause you just realize he has an amazing life  Alright  Just take those old records off the shelf  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Today's music  See he's always talking about the past  Today's music ain't got the same soul  He likes old time rock and roll  This guy is like  If you listen to this music  You think he's gonna kill himself  Because he's old  I always think it's hilarious  When these guys from this era bitch about disco 
[01:18:00]  Yeah  Because it always sounds like they're just being like  Get these blacks out of the room  I don't like the way they look  You're right  That sounds so fucking racist  But there's a dance beat in that song basically  I know  That's  You know what I mean?  It's like a  There's a rhythm there  That's a disco beat dude  Absolutely  But they don't want to admit that  They're actually  Acknowledging that disco was pretty fucking huge 
[01:18:30]  Oh my god  I got another great guy to throw on this list of douchey guys  Douchey guys  Wait wait wait wait  I love Seeger  It's funny that we broke down his song  But I don't  I don't consider him douchey  It's  He's the same thing as all the other guys to me  Like Allentown is a great song  But  Shut the fuck up  Shut up Billy  It's a great pop song  Billy Joe I mean you know?  Yeah  It's you know what I'm saying?  It's what we were talking about  It's like they're half  You love them but you're like 
[01:19:00]  Oh Christ  Yeah  Why'd you have to go there type of thing  Yeah  But  This seems like a very basic song  It was a huge hit obviously  Clang  I love this song  But anyone could have sang this  Really?  But he wrote it I guess  Oh he wrote it  Right  Well dude he lived it dude  Oh yeah  Did he live it?  I love that  Yeah  Did he?  Did he really?  Here he's down  Who's the other douchey guy?  Cause we've done the Allentown break  Yeah  Are you ready? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah  Uh George Thorogood  Oh yeah  I'm bad  I'm bad  We get it George  You like to drink  Oh God  But he's a badass  I wonder if anyone ever called him out on being a badass  Said really George what do you got?  Yeah exactly  He just keeps singing in his face  I'm bad  I'm scotch  I'm beer  Yeah  I like this sound though  Yeah  You weren't a big George Thorogood fan?  I like  I like one bourbon one scotch  It's the same  It's the same thing  Yeah 
[01:20:00]  It annoys me that I like it  Can you go to the beginning of one bourbon one scotch one beer?  Cause there's a whole set up story man  The rent is  I like that  The rent is laid  The rent's laid  He's got all sorts of problems  And you know how he's gonna fix that?  By drinking  That's right  He's just gonna drink  Yeah  Even the beginning of this  Bad to the bone  Is ruined  You can never listen to it  Because it's like  Bad to the bone got ruined because like  They did too many cheesy montages to it  It's just pauses  Oh yeah yeah  Like they would do like  They would do like a commercial for the Golden Girls 
[01:20:30]  And it would be like a montage of Sophia  Saying crazy things  He'd be playing Bad to the bone  Bad to the bone you're right  He's just doing Bo Diddley really right?  Right there?  Well George Thorogood's just doing Bo Diddley riffs isn't he?  Yeah  He's not very good  Yeah pretty much  I think right?  I don't think he's very good  What is it with guys with  I don't  Big mouths wanting to play the blues  Him and fucking Stevie Ray Vaughan  Just horse tooth fucking  Stevie Ray Vaughan  Stevie Ray Vaughan  Come on man  I'm not trashing his music  I'm just saying they both  Can you imagine what he would've 
[01:21:00]  Well he probably would've got fucking wimpy  If he'd have been a Wilberry  Who knows  He would stink now if he was still alive  Couldn't stand the weather  You don't like fucking Stevie Ray Vaughan?  No I'm saying if he was still alive he would stink now  How old would Hendrix be right now?  Probably  Not that old  No come on  Believe it or not not that old  Come on  He'd probably be like 55  No way  No he'd be older than that  He'd be  I'd say 70's  I don't think he'd be in the 70's  I think Hendrix is 70's  I don't think so man 
[01:21:30]  Look up Hendrix  When was he born?  1970  He was born in 1970?  No he wasn't born in 1970  I looked like an asshole  I can't just say he was born in  He fucking died  Oh my god  He died in 1970  Holy shit  I wish your mic was on  How old is Hendrix?  When was he born?  1970  1970  42  He'd be about 75  See?  42 is  75  58 plus 70  What's wrong with you?  70?  Oh right  70  Alright so  That's not that old 
[01:22:00]  You know what though?  For Hendrix  I mean fucking  70 year old Hendrix  Do you know how sad it would be?  Do you know how sad it would be?  Do you know how sad it would be a 70 year old Hendrix?  That'd be sad  He'd be all fucking fat and shit  Oh my god  And he'd sit there on the stool  And it would be all like  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun  You know what I mean?  It would be like stock blues music  It wouldn't be good anymore  Tonight it's  Yeah it's some shitty place  It's like  Jimi Hendrix  And you go  And people are like  Yeah man I saw Hendrix last night  Yeah he's kinda slowing down  Is he still good?  He can still play  You know he can still play 
[01:22:30]  He can still play  He's just a legend  Yeah  The greatest guitarist ever  Because he died  Yeah  There's a couple things coming in  The douchiest Seeger song  Anyone wanna guess it?  Douchiest  I only know those two songs  He got way douchier  I forgot about this  Until Jason the Trucker fucking  Like a rock  Oh  It's a movie you talk about a lot  It's in a movie you talk about a lot  Oh yeah?  Or from time to time  Oh boy  Shakedown  Shakedown  Oh yeah?  Oh that's Seeger? 
[01:23:00]  From Beverly Hills Cop  I like that song  That's Seeger yeah?  Shakedown  Shakedown  Shakedown  Shakedown  Shakedown  Shakedown  Oh boy  I like this song  It's pretty bad  Yeah it's an 80's song  It is  You can hear it with that  I never knew this was Seeger  You busted  Oh my god  Look at that picture of Seeger  He looks like the amazing Jonathan  That is fucking hilarious looking  Holy shit  Look at him right there  Oh man 
[01:23:30]  Did you hear that?  He completely changed the sound  Wow  Because it was all around him  Oh my god  Look at him right there  You're right  You would never even know this is Seeger  No  No  He steps it up a little  He has like amazing range in his voice  He looks like a happy  That's also  That picture right there  Where he's wearing this like Nike fucking shirt  That he bought at Foot Locker  It could be a Broncos shirt no?  But like it looks like a jogging sports shirt 
[01:24:00]  Like when there's a guy  That's like  Like a scene  Like a scene oriented musician  Yeah  Like punk  Blues rock whatever  Where there's a look that goes along with it  There's nothing sadder than when they get so old  That they just start dressing like a dad  Oh god yeah  And they're just wearing the sweats and whatever  And you're like  Oh boy  It's so sad man  You're like wow  It takes so much out of the music  You know  Get one of the older pictures of him  Like where he's  Oh god  He's got dark hair 
[01:24:30]  And we got inside info  Look at him right there  He looks like a fucking badass  Oh man  Oh man  That guy was getting a lot of pussy  He was getting some  I'll puss off  Hey I got a guy  We got some inside info on  Oh yeah  That guy isn't late  Scott in Detroit  Go ahead Scott  Yeah I was  I did some tour photography work  For Bob Seger  This last tour  And there was a brilliant issue  With his weight  And with his teeth  If  For example  I shot the tour opener  I took 1600 images  After the show  I went backstage  Production office  We went through all 1600 
[01:25:00]  They approved 10 images  Because if it showed his teeth  Or if he looked fat in the image  They could not use it  And then  And on top of  Wait how bad is his teeth  Slow down  Oh real bad  Bad  Go that one  Go that one  Go that one right there in the middle  I wanna see  Oh shit  Well that looks like he's got the fake teeth there  Does he?  Well you know  They've talked to him about getting his teeth fixed  And he doesn't want to  Because he feels it's gonna affect the way he's saying  Oh  Oh  His teeth are a little weird  You know but I'm sure Anthony you know 
[01:25:30]  I mean you know  When you sing  You're singing from the gut  From the throat  You're not using your teeth  I don't think that would affect the way his voice would sound  Would you think that?  Maybe he's afraid he'll have a lift or something  And he's a little fat these days  Yeah I put on some weight  I told management  I said  Why should he put down a slice of pizza  You know  Instead of eating a whole pizza everyday  Wasn't he  You're bashing  You're bashing him to management  While you're trying to take the pictures  Well he's frustrated  He took 1600 pictures  Yeah  You sound like a real business strategist  10  10 images 
[01:26:00]  That was it  How does he sound?  Sounds great  He puts on a hell of a show  Man it's hit after hit after hit  Right  But he just you know  He's kind of an eyesore  You know what I mean?  Alright  Do some weight  Get your teeth fixed  Wow  He's a pussy again  Scott wants his rock stars to look pretty  Yeah  Yeah  2012  Can I give myself a shameless plug?  What?  Can I give myself a shameless plug?  Yeah please do  Because you're not going to be working for the fucking Seeger tour anymore  In this fucking report  You're not going to be on the road again 
[01:26:30]  It's rockstyleprophotography.com  And actually I just got shot the Bruce Springsteen up on my website  Oh  Everyone has  Everyone's got the Bruce focus  Even I do  What did that sound like Sam?  Thank you Sam  It was hard to hear really  Was it?  What was it?  I want to hear some brand new Bob Seeger live  I want to see what he sounds like these days  Against the wind  Oh yeah he did Against the wind too  That's right  Big old light show  Remember those light shows like that?  Yeah 
[01:27:00]  And the crowd goes wild  Oh  A little deeper  Sounds like me  I can't keep up  Yeah it's slow  Is this someone's phone?  Is this a phone?  Is it a phone? 
[01:27:30]  Is this a phone?  I can't stay in the room  Right?  Ah there's something going on  Sounds like Tom Waits but not on purpose  Right  Like Tom Waits does it?  Yeah, I think  I think those years of screaming out fucking  Going to Katmandu  Let's go to George Thurgood and find out what his problems are  that led him to drinking with that fucking  landlord. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, man.  Yeah. This pompous ass that had  to have the long setup. 
[01:28:00]  This song's setup was so  fucking long.  Oh, do ya?  At this bottom of the day, it says one bourbon,  one scotch. It's like, why would you have a bourbon and  a scotch? And a beer.  It'd be bourbon and... Right, and beer.  Yeah, or scotch and beer.  The song wouldn't sound the same.  Next Friday. Now, next Friday, come on, I didn't get the rent.  Oh, shit. Listen to that awful voice  he's doing. Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  Out the door he went. Terrible.  Now what happens?  What happens?  So I goes to the landlady. So I goes to the  landlady. Yeah. I said,  I said, I said, I said, I  step and fidgets now. I say, I say.  Fucking voice he's doing. Jesus Christ.  Boy's about as sharp as  a sack of wet mice.  I don't want to.  Here you go. Yeah.  Home in the evening.  Say, I got nothing nice to say to me.  Is this with the Delaware destroyers? 
[01:29:00]  No.  Ugh, Delaware.  Exactly.  He should flip those words around  to destroy Delaware.  Jesus Christ.  We're admitted into the song.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  I said, no.  We get it.  You don't have the rent money.  I got no money to pay the rent.  Look at this fat  fucking Biff  Tannen face.  He is Biff Tannen.  Holy shit, he's Biff Tannen.  Yeah, look at that fucking...  Wow. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I said, but I'm tired.  I've been walking all day.  She said, that don't be fun, me.  Who's sitting at a concert  watching this  and be like, yeah,  yeah, I need you to shut up.  Get to the part  that a band kicks in.  He went out the door again.  He doesn't have the rent money.  He's out the door again.  You could have saved  two minutes on this.  But it's time.  It's two minutes in.  It's time.  Got to my good friend's house.  Yeah, what happened there?  I said, look, man. 
[01:30:00]  I'm outdoors, you know.  Can I stay with you  maybe a couple days?  He said, let me go  and ask my wife.  Come out of the house.  I'll tell you, I'll tell you.  I know there was no...  You think, like,  that the people sitting there  in the audience watching this  and they know all the words  and they're like...  I said, I know.  They're talking along with them.  I bet you they're...  Yeah, I bet you  they're all yelling it out  in unison.  Yeah, yeah.  Two and a half minutes in.  So I go back home. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, he's going back home.  I'll tell the little lady.  Little lady.  I got a job.  I'm going to pay the rent.  She said, yeah.  I said, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then she was so nice.  Oh, man.  Story.  And a boring story.  It stinks.  Was she?  Oh, my God.  Three minutes in.  It's three minutes?  This would have been  a song already. 
[01:31:00]  You wouldn't even  start of the song.  It would have been  all the way up  to the guitar solo  by now.  Everyone in blues bands  are always slipping  out the back door.  He's talking like  Anthony Michael Hall  in that weird science scene  when they go to that  black bar.  Right, right, right.  Literally put on.  Yeah, it sounds like  ridiculous the way he talks.  Now he's at the bar.  Three and a half minutes in.  Look, man.  Come down here.  He got down now. 
[01:31:30]  So what you want?  I want.  Yay, finally.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, is that what you want?  Well, I ain't seen  my baby since I was  The song should start  right there.  Right.  Well, I appreciate  this is like  this is the song.  That would be a good  live version.  A little something different.  But not the version  on the stupid records.  It's like  an M. Night Shyamalan movie.  You can, like,  the first time through  you're like,  I don't see what he did.  And then never again. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, you can't watch  his movies twice, huh?  No.  No, you can't.  No rewatchability there.  He's another one  that kind of fucking stinks.  Yeah.  No one's willing  to acknowledge that, though.  That's...  I was really into him  for the first few movies  and then I just...  He lost me with Signs  and then I never...  He never got me back.  Yeah.  You know?  God, that song  is terrible.  Ugh.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Story.  Story songs.  Story songs.  We've done that on our show. 
[01:32:30]  That's a good fucking story.  He's telling a story.  I hate story songs.  That fucking Alice's Restaurant.  Oh, God.  And then I went  and there was Alice  sitting at the restaurant  and I went,  all right,  In real time.  He's telling the story  in real time.  Oh, man.  And that other one,  I rented a hole  in the...  And they cast off  the bow line  and went out.  Wait, but that's...  Edmund Fitzgerald.  No, I thought that was...  Rick of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  I thought that was our boy, uh...  Sundown. 
[01:33:00]  Isn't it?  Another one, yeah.  Gordon Lightfoot.  We like Gordon.  We, I thought...  Gordon Lightfoot.  I thought we were all  on the side with Gordon.  In the room  where you do  what you don't confess.  What's going on  in that room?  Ass sex?  Fucking, what are you,  blowing men?  We don't confess that.  We have more story songs.  Any more story songs?  Stories?  Stories?  How about, uh,  Neek, uh, mine, uh...  Oh, dude,  Tom's Diner? 
[01:33:30]  No, not Tom's Diner.  What's that Susan?  My name is Nico.  Oh, Luca?  Luca.  My name is Luca.  I live on the second floor.  I live upstairs from you.  Guess you  had ever seen me before.  And everybody always goes,  anytime you talk about this song,  somebody goes,  you know that song's about rape?  And it's like,  is it?  Well,  rape is really fucking boring,  apparently.  I thought rape was violent  and terrifying.  It's really slow-paced  and fucking boring.  I thought she just got  fucking, uh, abused. 
[01:34:00]  I thought she was,  like, getting punched.  Like, I thought her family  was, uh,  like, physically abusing her,  but not sexually.  I didn't know it was sexual.  Is that how you talked  about getting abused?  Would you have that  fucking medium pace?  Yeah, yeah.  You'd be like,  I ain't got fucking  punched in the face.  Well, I swear.  She makes it all nice.  My name is Anthony.  I live on the second floor.  My dad's throwing spaghetti  at the wall.  And I have a stomachache.  I hate those songs  that you'd never realize  it was a horrific,  horrific fucking tragic song. 
[01:34:30]  It just sounds so nice  and then someone has to point out  and you realize  what that's about?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a few of those.  James Taylor tells it.  He's a story guy, too.  Yeah, that's true.  James Taylor tells  his little stories.  Can't get into them, man.  So does, uh,  uh,  Paul Simon.  He's a story guy.  But he isn't like,  tell,  he sings it, though,  at least.  Well, yeah.  I'm talking about these guys  that they're,  they're kind of  making believe they're singing.  Oh, that's a good one.  Harry Chapin.  Oh, man.  Harry Chapin is a storyteller.  Oh, he's Harry Chapin.  That motherfucker  will spin a yarn. 
[01:35:00]  What about that?  That film taxi song.  Oh, my God.  Driving in my taxi,  taking tips  and getting stoned.  It was raining.  It was raining.  He just gives us  a weather report.  Oh, he just needed  one more fare.  No, you don't.  No.  Harry, shut your fucking face.  She said,  Harry, keep the change.  Oh, God damn it.  What is their obsession  with the common man 
[01:35:30]  that they abuse  on a regular basis?  What is their fucking  obsession with it?  You don't think  he's giving good tips?  Well, he's not doing  anything these days,  but when he was alive,  oh, my God,  he died in a fiery  fucking car accident  on the long-hour expressway.  Yeah, he lost his head.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Back to trailer versus.  I guess he should have  taken a cab.  Yeah, yeah.  I was driving home.  How old was he  when he died?  That's terrible.  I don't know.  I would guess 42.  I could swear 
[01:36:00]  I've seen her face.  38.  Was he drunk?  He looked a lot older than 38.  He picked up his chick,  his ex.  He picked up a chick  that he used to go out with,  apparently.  And, you know,  she's very successful  and he's just driving  a hack, man.  Yeah.  And, you know,  they had a little chat  about old times.  He's just thinking  about old times.  Who gives a fuck?  I know.  I just picture  every one of these guys  getting, you know,  like a fucking blow job  as another woman 
[01:36:30]  spoons cocaine  into their nose  and they're just  leaning back.  I think I'm going to,  next song's going to be  about taxi drivers, guys.  What do you think, guys?  This whole fucking team  of yes men.  That's fucking brilliant, Harry.  That sounds good to me.  Fucking get out of here.  You don't think  they're just like  the common man?  You don't believe that?  And this is such  a romanticized version  of a cab driver.  He's the white guy.  He had this hopes  and dreams  and this life before,  but somehow  he ended up in a cab. 
[01:37:00]  I told one of the stories  on the air.  I had a cab driver  that basically was telling me  he was going to kill himself  so his family  could collect the insurance money  because his life  sucked that bad.  And he's driving me  and I'm thinking,  are you going to kill me  while I'm in the fucking thing?  Jesus Christ.  Are you going to kill yourself  while I'm in this fucking thing?  It was the most depressing  story ever.  And if you talk to these guys,  they work 20-hour shifts  and then they have to get back  in four hours  to do another 20-hour shift.  Yeah, it's brutal.  And if they take a day off,  they lose their spot.  Being a taxi driver sucks. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, that's right.  He was going to be a pilot.  What?  He was supposed to be a pilot.  So what happened?  Harry Chapin?  His eyes are bad?  He took off to find this guy.  He started smoking weed  and doing drugs.  Oh, boy.  That's what happened.  Oh, I got it now.  Is he going to turn his life around  by the end of the song?  No.  No, she gets out of the cab  and that's it.  They don't have anything  in common anymore.  They don't have those hopes  and dreams.  She made something of herself.  He didn't.  How about, uh...  How about, uh...  What's his face? 
[01:38:00]  Bad, bad Leroy Brown?  I like the Jim Croce.  Jim Croce is another storyteller guy.  Yeah, Croce's one.  But that time in the bottle  will make you fucking  ball your eyes out.  What the fuck is that about?  Time in a bottle.  The first thing that  I'd like to do  is to save every day  till eternity passes  away  just to spend them with you.  Some of these songs  and singers will put you  in that part of your brain  that's just, like,  that area you don't want to visit. 
[01:38:30]  All that, like,  creepy area.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, the carpenters  would put you in that area.  I don't like this.  It's deeply depressing.  I'm like,  ugh, fuck,  I don't want to listen to this.  It makes me feel like  when I was, like,  six years old  and, I don't know,  something weird about...  You're learning about death  the first time  and you just can't even  come close to wrapping  your mind around it.  Like, why do you need  time in a bottle?  Is it time, like, endless?  Yeah.  Don't we...  Oh, wait a minute.  That's right.  Oh, that's right.  This is someone singing  about fucking...  There isn't enough time  to do anything.  Oh, that's right.  He's basically telling everyone 
[01:39:00]  that you're gonna just get old,  forget everybody, and die.  Great.  The cat's in the cradle  and the silver spoon  and all that shit.  Little boy blue  and the man in the moon.  Oh, God.  And the sun turned out  to be just like his dad.  Oh, did you...  Oh, did you...  Awful video.  This is Jim Croce.  What about that, uh,  we had time, we had...  We had joy, we had fun.  We had seasons in the sun.  And that sounds like  a nice little pop song.  It's, like, about a guy dying.  Oh, yeah.  And this is basically 
[01:39:30]  his last fucking day  on earth or something.  Goodbye, my love,  it's hard to die  when all the fucking shit  is in the sky.  What song is that?  This one.  Yeah.  This one's terrible.  It's the same song, I believe.  We've known each other  since we were nine or ten.  You know what I thought  this was for a second?  Together we've climbed  Wonderful Christmas time.  Oh, yeah.  Simply having...  Yeah.  Listen to these words.  He's saying goodbye  to everyone, he's dying.  Goodbye, my friend,  it's hard to die.  Jesus. 
[01:40:00]  This is terrible.  Who is this?  Terry Jacks.  I knew that before  you fucking whispered  it in my ear.  I know music.  All these songs sound like  they'd be the soundtrack  to, like, Harold and Maude,  like that kind of movie.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Very 1970s.  Black comedy,  kind of dark thing.  Like Heartbreak Kid.  You know, all those  old 70s, late 70s,  like, sort of dark comedies.  What about...  What's his face?  Out of time.  Great. 
[01:40:30]  He's out of time.  The guy that sings  Toy Story.  Goodbye, Papa.  Papa, please pray for me.  Yeah, Randy Newman.  Randy Newman.  He's another story guy.  Yeah, yeah, he loves L.A.  Why is this guy dying?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  The cancer.  Why did Jim Croce die  when he was 30?  Plane crash.  Plane crash.  Joe, everyone knows that.  He was another one  of those plane crash guys.  What about Joe Cocker?  He's not really a storyteller,  is he?  No? 
[01:41:00]  I don't know.  I just always...  I'm thinking of him  because of the Wonder Years song.  Who else told  horrible fucking stories  that I think I got?  You know how long  Bruce Springsteen's been around?  Because we were talking  about it yesterday, Ant?  How long?  Guy tweeted me and said,  I was watching  the Wonder Years  and they were going  to a Bruce Springsteen concert.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  And then he goes,  and I checked your Twitter  and you had that picture  of Springsteen  and he realized,  holy fuck,  this guy's been around  a long time.  We all know  he's been around  a long time,  but that puts it 
[01:41:30]  in perspective.  Jesus Christ.  The Wonder Years.  Oh my God.  Who did that song  Run, Joey, Run?  Logan's bringing that up.  Run, Joey, Run.  It was a story  about like,  Joey,  apparently,  what was he,  fucking some chick?  What's the story  behind that one?  Do you have that one?  Got it.  Okay.  Okay, here it is.  You want to pot it up?  Computer.  Computer.  Oh, sorry, sorry.  Computer.  Run, Joey, Run. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know this.  Who does this?  I don't think  I know this at all.  This one.  David.  Daddy, please don't.  It wasn't his fault.  He means so much to me.  Daddy, please don't.  We're going to get married.  Just you wait and see.  Ugh.  I think the father, like...  Every night,  the same old dream.  This sounds super like...  You were saying it earlier  with Tarantino.  This sounds like a Tarantino.  Ha, ha.  You know?  The memory,  the sound of Julie's cries. 
[01:42:30]  She called me up  late that night.  How does the video  have a fucking iPhone in it?  Amazing.  What's going on?  My dad and I  just had a fight.  Oh.  And he stormed out the door.  I've never seen him  act this way.  I think the father  kills him or something.  Oh, my God.  Or he kills the father.  I don't know.  It's a horrible song.  Oh. 
[01:43:00]  Run.  Oh, God.  How awful.  Very dramatic.  And then this whiny piece of shit.  Dude, you want to see  something sad?  I thank you for that.  I can't listen to this anymore.  You want to see something sad?  Huh?  You want to see something sad?  What?  Look at a recent clip  of Yes.  Remember how awesome  Yes was in the 70s?  Yeah.  Look at a recent clip of them.  Bad.  Oh, they're just so old  and they look so fucking lame.  I think it's Steve Howe. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, God.  It looks literally  like a corpse with hair.  Oh, man.  Like the crypt.  Can you pull up?  The crypt.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, look.  Can you pull up a video?  Is that Steve Howe on the left?  Look at how funny.  They were all cool  back in the day.  We need the singer, though.  We need the guy that's...  Aren't they, like, split up  so one is calling themselves...  Oh, fuck.  What do they call themselves?  Oh, with the big keyboard set up.  I think there's the fake Yes. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, this is it.  We need the guy  that actually sang Roundabout  and all this.  Yeah, get a real hit.  Hey, Sam, find one of their hits.  Sam has no idea  who this band is.  Sam, name one Yes song, please.  Go ahead, please.  Except for the one  that you're just fucking on.  You can do this.  No, I can't.  I don't know any Yes hits.  You don't?  Are you panicking?  You do.  They got a big one, buddy.  I don't know.  You know, right?  They got a real big one  that you would know.  I probably know the song.  Ready?  I'll give you a hint.  Ready? 
[01:44:30]  Tom Sawyer?  Tom Sawyer.  That's Rush.  Tom Sawyer.  Rush still fucking rules.  Rush still rules.  I like Rush.  No, no, not Tom Sawyer.  Listen to me.  You're a Tom Sawyer there.  No.  I'll give you a movie hint.  Okay.  The breakup.  I don't know.  Sad.  Oh, God.  Real sad.  What other hints can we get?  Maybe we're just really old.  No, no, no, no.  Maybe we're just old.  Lose yourself! 
[01:45:00]  I mean, I know that song.  That's it.  Yes.  Okay, but that's like a goofy song.  Yeah, because they got really shitty.  Oh, okay.  That was like late 80s.  It's been around a long fucking time.  I mean, they were such a good art rock band in the fucking 70s, and it's like, I've never  seen a band slide off like worse than Yes.  Double album, you'd fucking get the album.  Or Chicago.  All that artwork in there.  Oh, Chicago, please.  Oh, I know.  Owner of a Lonely Heart.  There you go.  I saw Yes in Buffalo back in, I think, around 1990, and John Anderson, and I didn't believe 
[01:45:30]  it at the time, but I saw it with my own eyes, he likes sleeping on the stage, so the  venues would allow him to sleep overnight in a tent on the stage.  That was his thing for a while.  I don't know if he's still doing it.  Why?  I saw the tent.  Why would he do that?  I don't know, man.  That was John Anderson.  Remember he sang for us in Vegas, in front of like 20 people?  Really?  Acoustic.  He was involved with XM in the early days, and they brought him out to CES. 
[01:46:00]  You don't remember this?  Oh, right.  Okay, yep.  Yep, CES.  In front of, I don't know, maybe 25, 30 people, he's singing acoustic guest songs.  I watched a concert of theirs from like 2010, and he literally, he's so old, and he's not  so old, he's just an old, you know, he looks like a dad now.  He's gotta be close to 70 as well.  And he's wearing like this ridiculous robe thing.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's him.  And he's dancing like this. 
[01:46:30]  He's going, he's going like this.  Like during the song, as he's singing, and it looks, he looks like an old woman, like  conducting a church group or something.  Oh, that's bad.  And you're like, you're fucking yes, what are you doing?  You sang Heart of the Sunrise.  What the fuck are you doing right now?  They're old.  Oh, he's 68.  Rush is almost, Rush is pushing 60, and their new album, I heard three tracks from it, is  fucking ridiculous.  A few people have said that. 
[01:47:00]  Amazing.  A few people have said that.  Imagine that, really.  In the last few weeks.  I can't believe it.  Like, it's un-fucking-real.  They still rip, man.  I'm kind of obsessed with these songs that you think are nice, fun-loving songs.  Oh, sorry.  No, it's cool.  And then they're just, you know, there's just nothing but tragedy in the song.  Yeah, yeah.  Tom Jones.  Jay in Staten Island.  What do you got on Tom Jones?  Delilah.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Delilah's, uh...  He's stalking his girlfriend, and he sees her, and he's been screwing around, and then  he leaves. 
[01:47:30]  He comes up and sees the girl, and the girl laughs at his face, and he stabs her.  I like this song.  This is a good song.  Yeah.  He stabs her.  Tom Jones is the shit.  Did you hear that masterful?  That was masterful, the way he said, and then he stabs her, the way you faded the music  in.  Ah, it's perfect.  That was perfection.  Sometimes it happens.  Sometimes we just luck out.  This, uh...  This guy's voice is fucking great.  Did you know that?  Listen to the power here.  Listen to it right here. 
[01:48:00]  He's just got, like, that fucking kick-ass voice.  Oh, Jesus.  He sings the way I always imagined Zorro would sing.  Wow, wow, wow, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  This horns.  Mexican horns.  Oh, what happened?  Yes, my parents had Tom Jones albums. 
[01:48:30]  Yes.  The old stuff is...  I love that old shit.  Oh.  The old Tom Jones stuff.  Great.  I had no idea this was about stabbing a bitch.  Oh, yeah, he comes in later on.  He catches her fucking around.  Yeah.  He goes to the door, and she's laughing at him, and he fucking just stabs her, and then  he waits for the cops, I guess, or something.  I don't know.  Something.  Killed her.  Another story song coming in.  Billy, don't get it.  So we got on the floor with Jesse Dixon. 
[01:49:00]  Billy, don't be a hero.  Billy, don't be a hero is a story song.  And then there's the Billy Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahassee Bridge or something.  Isn't that the Vicki Lawrence song?  Yes, right?  Isn't it Vicki Lawrence?  She also sang The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, right?  Oh, that's the one.  That's the one from...  That's the one from...  You know, it's the first time I realized that she killed the husband.  Right, right.  I thought...  What the fuck does he say at Reservoir Dogs?  What's he saying?  Yes.  No, I thought Annie shot the husband. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Is that the line?  All right.  Whoa, this guy's groovy.  Wow.  Is there any way to find out what he says in Reservoir Dogs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought Annie shot her.  Annie shot her.  No, no, no.  It was the other...  What the fuck did you say?  It was...  Yeah.  No, she was warning him.  Do you remember that, Opie?  Yeah, I really don't.  That Diner Seed?  Yeah.  I'm driving over here.  I'm listening to K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70s.  K-Billy. 
[01:50:00]  The Night Delights went out and Georgia comes on.  Oh, that's a good song.  And they're like, oh, yeah, that's a good song.  Yeah, that's a good song.  Yeah, that's a good song.  That's my first time I ever realized that she's the one that killed...  Whatever the fuck the guy's name is.  God damn it.  That's driving me crazy.  That's the famous...  It's the diner scene.  Fucking scene.  You ain't gonna get that one.  That diner scene is amazing.  Oh, it's the fucking...  Now you gotta watch this movie over the weekend.  There we go.  That's the tip.  That's tipping.  I don't tip.  I don't tip.  Uh, there you go. 
[01:50:30]  Dining with Reservoir Dogs.  King fucking clip on time.  The AV Club travels.  Oh, it's commercial.  Dude, they're the worst with these commercials.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no, that's bullshit anyway.  Oh, it's bullshit.  Oh, boy.  It's bullshit?  It's bullshit.  You're bullshit.  No, no, no.  All right.  Bullshit.  No, this is a...  No.  That's a dressing room.  She's following you.  It was the T-Mobile girl.  She was a so hard commercial.  What the...  I'll give you the tipping part.  Yeah.  All right.  We could maybe get it after the break. 
[01:51:00]  It's break time.  Yeah, we'll take a little break.  Joe, are you promoting anything besides good health for your mom?  Yes.  You are?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Well, two things, if I may.  Well, Memorial Day weekend, I got a lot going on.  There's...  I have three shows at Caroline's that Memorial Day week, the Wednesday before, the Thursday  before, and the Sunday before.  I'm doing headlining shows at Caroline's, so please come out to those.  And the web series pilot that Anthony was in, that I shot, that actually comes out that 
[01:51:30]  week as well.  That's coming out that week.  Nice.  So I'll have more details on that to come, but it's going to be on the Warner Sound,  which is Warner Brothers Records' new YouTube channel.  So that week, there's a lot happening.  So come out to those shows and watch that when it all happens.  Yes.  Very good.  All right.  We're going to break here.  Chop, chop.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel. 
[01:52:00]  SiriusXM.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to go.  I can't hear you.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, yo.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one. 
[01:52:30]  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's late at night.  And I have nowhere to go.  My money's gone and all, so all my friends.  And the cops says to me, hey, you smell bad. 
[01:53:00]  Get out of here.  And he says, and you know I have an angel.  And he said, that ain't you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me.  Shelter me from the falling rain. 
[01:53:30]  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Is that just a little piece?  Sirius XM.  It's the Opinion Show. 
[01:54:00]  Got Joe DeRosa hanging with us today.  Thank you.  And we're just chilling, man.  Yeah, man.  We're just chilling.  Just fucking hanging loose.  Trying to get to the weekend like everybody else, man.  Just ready to fucking get some dick.  I had a great coughing fucking episode there, and I don't even know what the fuck that was.  Oh, wait, what? 
[01:54:30]  I just slid it in.  That was good.  I didn't even notice.  We got the tan mom.  The tan mom?  You don't know about tan mom?  Yeah, yeah.  With the daughter.  Putting her kid in the fucking oven.  Yeah.  To get it tanned.  Yeah.  Burned the camera.  Are they going to be able to prove that the kid went tanning, tanning?  Well, mom's saying that she's just got a sunburn from being outside.  Being outside.  But the kid said, yeah, I went tanning with my mom. 
[01:55:00]  And the mom is a fucking psychopath.  She's got this tan that's just bizarre.  She looks like she got frostbite on her face.  That's how bad it is.  Yeah, she don't look good.  It's not a nice tan.  She says you're all just jealous.  You're all just jealous.  If the tanning salon had no rules against the kid going in, what's the problem?  Exactly.  I don't see how that's really...  I don't know.  Is that abuse?  Because they're...  No, it's not.  People have to stick their fucking noses in everything. 
[01:55:30]  A six-year-old in a tanning bed?  What's wrong with you guys?  Well, listen, I'm not saying...  I don't give a fuck because I don't know these people, but it doesn't sound too fucking  healthy.  I'm not saying it's good to put a six-year-old in a tanning bed, but I'm saying if the tanning  salon didn't stop it, I guess clearly there's no rule against it, right?  Well, it all depends.  You know what?  I might just change my opinion on the spot.  Like, you know, kids are very curious about everything, so you go to the tanning salon,  she gets the full fucking tanning thing, and maybe the kid's like, oh, you know, and 
[01:56:00]  all right, put her in there for a minute.  You know what I mean?  Maybe a minute just so she can check it out.  I could see something like that.  They fucking let the kids run around the beach and shit and get sunburned, you know?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's really no different from that.  They did a whole suntan thing on the news yesterday.  You know, we're supposed to be wearing suntan lotion all year round?  Really?  To be safe?  I don't buy that at all.  And they say that the FDA doesn't acknowledge waterproof tanning lotions. 
[01:56:30]  Really?  That's all bullshit, too?  What does that mean?  The FDA doesn't acknowledge that as a term, waterproof.  Oh, because it comes off.  Yeah, but some of these companies, you know, they make a lotion where they say waterproof or  whatever.  I don't even wear it in the summer.  When I go to the beach, I rarely wear it.  Rarely do.  I just fucking tan.  You're lucky, though.  You got the darker skin, I think.  Yeah.  That's what I got, man.  I've been sunburned once in my life, ever.  Really?  Once.  Why?  Why?  Why only once? 
[01:57:00]  It only happened once.  I don't know.  But you don't wear lotion.  I know.  What, do you walk around in a parka?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  I'm more perplexed by why it happened the one time than why I don't get...  Because that's how much I don't ever get sunburned.  So the one time it did happen, I'm like, that's weird.  Why'd that happen?  You've never had it so bad that you can't take a shower?  Oh, man.  The one time I had it was bad, but I don't know what bad is, so to me, anything would  have been bad, you know?  So you choose not to shower for at least three or four days? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Really?  You've never had it that bad?  No, I only had it the one time.  Oh, it's brutal.  Is it like having, like, poison ivy?  No.  No, I don't mean, like, does it feel like that?  It's like having extremely dry skin.  It's like dry and tight, and if you smack it or scratch it, like, sometimes you forget  at first, and you're like, oh, I got an itch, and you'll scratch your arm, and then, like,  five seconds later, this deep fucking pain just sets in.  It's really weird, that delay. 
[01:58:00]  Jersey State law can't tan under 14.  Oh.  But I'm thinking if it's like a bring your kid to work type of situation where you might  let him try it.  Bring your kid to tan?  You know, I'll just try it out.  Yeah.  Just slightly.  I could see that, maybe.  Well, why'd the salon let the kid in?  We don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  Have they talked to him?  Maybe the mom was saying, like, oh, my kid's going to sit here in the room, but not in  the tanning bed.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  And that's what the mom is saying, that she took her to the tanning salon, but not in the  bed.  And I'm sure we could do a whole bit on people's kids getting them in trouble, because the kids 
[01:58:30]  can't explain themselves.  They don't know how to shut the fuck up.  They can't explain themselves yet.  So they'll say one little thing, and it's like, what?  This kid went into school, and one of the teachers noticed the kid had a sunburn, and said,  what happened?  And the kid went, I went to tanning with mommy.  And she said she went in the tanning booth and everything and got burned.  And then, of course, the teachers call the cops now, and you're in fucking trouble.  They call the cops for everything. 
[01:59:00]  Jesus Christ.  It's ridiculous.  I thank God that, or not God, because I don't believe in him, but I thank whatever, that  I grew up in a different time than this, because I remember my mom.  And she was like, I was going up the stairs, and she was tapping my ass, to speed it up  a little bit.  And I put my hand back, but we were joking around.  I was really young.  And she accidentally broke my finger.  She swatted it by accident. 
[01:59:30]  But it was an accident.  I knew it was an accident.  But I went to school with the cast on, and they were like, what happened to your finger?  And I was like, my mom broke my finger.  Because I didn't know how to say it right.  Yeah, of course.  And that would be enough to call the cops now.  Yeah.  Like, thank God they were like, we know that your mom didn't, you know, they took a minute  and figured it out.  But now, child welfare would be there, and the cops.  So ridiculous.  And you wouldn't be able to explain how the broken finger happened.  No.  So, to anyone looking in, they're like, holy fuck.  Fucking police state.  Your mom sucks.  Miserable people that have nothing better to do but fuck with other people. 
[02:00:00]  They're just fucking miserable.  Well, here's the tanning lady.  Yeah.  She's saying you're all jealous that she looked good.  Why did you?  I would never, never put my daughter in a tanning booth.  Oh, I believe you.  We go out shopping.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  I don't want to hear any more about this.  And anyone that makes, any mother that makes an accusation about me is not a mother because  I'm a great mother, and I would never do that to my child. 
[02:00:30]  Do you think there's some kind of witch out against you?  Yes.  Yes.  Why do you think that is?  There's somebody out there all my whole life that doesn't like me because they're jealous,  they're fat, and they're ugly.  Are you going to stop going to salons yourself, or are you going to keep going?  She sounds drunk, too.  She does.  She's like slurring.  I don't know if she is.  She's a disaster.  That would be the bigger concern to me is that she's possibly fucking inebriated.  Yeah.  She looks, that look is frightening. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, she looks like dog shit.  She's so tanned, but it's not tanned.  It's like, it's leathery.  Yeah.  You see those leathery women at the beach.  Oh, my gosh.  She looks sunburned.  Yeah.  Sunburned.  I think Ann nailed it.  She looks, uh...  Frostbite.  Frostbite.  She had frostbite.  And that wasn't even the darkest I've seen pictures of her.  Are you going to stop going to salons yourself, or are you going to keep going?  We've got a lady clapping, going, you go, girl.  Really?  Someone said that?  Yeah, you can hear what she goes, because they're jealous, because they're fat, they're 
[02:01:30]  ugly.  There's some lady clapping, going, you go, girl.  That's great.  That's hilarious.  That's wonderful.  I know we're moving on from music, but Masks underscore Menace writes, ever hear how much  smells like teen spirit sounds like Boston's more than a feeling?  I've heard this over the years.  Yeah.  Is there any way to go through that really fast?  Is there maybe a YouTube clip or something that kind of compares the two?  That would be nice.  Something like that? 
[02:02:00]  Like an A-B kind of thing?  I'm not feeling it.  I don't think that it sounds like it.  I'm not feeling it at all.  I know Kurt liked Boston.  He was into all that type of rock and roll when he was growing up.  But the story behind smells like teen spirit is they said, they were like, it sounded so  much like a Pixies song to them that they almost didn't want to put it on the album because  they felt like they were ripping off the Pixies.  Oh, really?  And they said when Butch Vig did the mix, it was different enough that they were like,  all right, whatever.  And then it became this fucking ridiculous.  Oh, is there a, oh, what did they do it live or something? 
[02:02:30]  Hold on, what does it go back up?  Is this worth playing or?  This works.  This is a good.  This works.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Kurt.  This is from 92.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's cool. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  You could sing this song over it.  Yeah, I was pretty underwhelmed with it also.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That was underwhelming.  Something there.  Yeah.  You were able to fit the words in, but the music didn't really sound like it.  I want to hear some of Jada Pinkett's stuff.  Do you have that?  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Oh, boy.  This is a rough.  What's the story on this, Joe?  You told us this during the break.  She's got a metal band called Wicked Wisdom, and they go around, and she does not have it 
[02:04:00]  announced that it's her.  You know, like on the clips I've seen, at least, on the late night shows and stuff.  This is from Letterman, and I believe he just says, he just introduced them like this  band.  Really?  Then it's confusing.  You're like, this band stinks.  Who is this?  That singer looks like Jada Pinkett.  And no one knows.  There's also a lot of comments about waiting for about two minutes into the choreographed head  banging.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's really cheesy.  Wow, a lot of dislikes.  But she's like a 40-something-year-old woman, so it's like, you know, I get it. 
[02:04:30]  What's she doing?  Yeah.  Let us see that.  Oh, boy.  What's she doing?  This would get into the Black Rock Coalition, by the way.  Oh.  This is embarrassing.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Something inside of me is pissed.  Oh.  Terrible, right?  Awesome.  Something inside of me is so insane.  This sucks.  It's terrible.  So weird. 
[02:05:30]  When is the choreographer?  Isn't that the chick from The Matrix?  Yeah.  She's, and she's so fucking hot, and it's like, she's like, making herself look so unattractive.  Like, everything she's doing, it's like, are you trying to not look so hot?  She looks boyish, right?  Oh.  It's not even, to me, like, how she's dressed as much as, like, these movements.  It's like, it's, yeah.  What are you doing?  Wow, she's really pissed off. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, the choreographed headbanging.  Oh, man, this is embarrassing.  Jesus Christ.  Oh.  You've got to work really hard to make music shittier than your husband's music. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, I would rather listen to the men in black fucking rap than this.  Marshall.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, this is embarrassing.  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  They're, like, bowing over with their heads.  Now she's, like, jumping around.  All their heads are moving in the same, same motion.  It's so, it's terrible. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, they had, they had somebody there being, like.  They had a choreographer.  Yeah.  Here's what you do, you go up here.  And now they're all shaking their heads.  And they look silly.  And she looks ridiculous.  Yeah, the whole thing is, like, the chorus is just her saying she's pissed.  She's wearing a Seven Dust t-shirt because she thinks that's what metalheads would wear.  It's cool.  And they would talk about being pissed.  I'm just amazed she likes this type of music. 
[02:07:30]  I'm really confused.  I know.  This is all confusing.  But when I heard she had a band, I was like, oh, that's hot, man.  That's going to be really funny.  But what got her to this point where she likes this type of music so much, she tried to do it herself.  That was strange.  I guess she's a metal fan.  She was always, like, she was always, like, had that kind of, kind of, like, metal-y vibe to her.  She always had the tattoos before that shit was cool.  And it's not that bad.  Opie, it's terrible.  It's terrible. 
[02:08:00]  It's not that bad.  Something that's out of bed.  Are you saying this to get a rise out of us?  No.  Somehow I'm not feeling her real anger.  I'm not going to download her.  Sorry.  I'm not going to download her.  She has a tiny little thing, isn't she?  I'm kind of amazed that she almost pulls it off.  She doesn't almost pull it off.  Every part of that is awful.  She's nowhere near the mark.  It's terrible, man.  Letterman would never just put a band on like that.  It's not that bad.  You've got Jada Pinkett.  I know what you're doing.  I'm not biting on this.  I'm not doing any pants.  You're already biting.  You're already nibbled. 
[02:08:30]  I'm reneging my bite.  I'm pulling back off my bite.  You want to hear that guy with the clouds again, but we have a new one.  A new cloud guy.  Did you hear the cloud guy on the way in?  No.  No.  A square-shaped cloud.  No, I didn't hear that.  He makes clouds, I don't know, shapeshift.  Changes shape with his mind.  Oh, really?  He's amazing.  Yeah.  Fucking awesome.  He's stupid. 
[02:09:00]  He looks up and he goes, you change the shape of the cloud.  Who is it?  You've got to see these videos.  They're fucked up.  All right.  Just how he talks, but Danny got another one.  He's got a lot of these.  So he's changing the shape of another clue.  But wait, is he a lunatic or is it somebody that people think is actually doing this?  I think he's got a little thing going on.  A little following?  I think he looks at some clouds, sees what shape it turns into, and then he fucking records 
[02:09:30]  the audio and makes it look like he's actually doing it.  I don't know.  But it's not about that.  It's about his voice.  Dude, I never even thought of that.  I said that yesterday.  I must not have heard it.  I said it yesterday.  Because the cloud he was talking about yesterday actually kind of turned into a square-sheep clue.  That's amazing.  So you keep the ambiance going by leaving the camera out there.  You wait for the fucking cloud to do what it's going to do, and then you record your audio.  Yeah, because why isn't he in the video?  Well, that's the giveaway, right?  He should be in the video saying that.  Yeah.  A good ambiance to clue. 
[02:10:00]  Because I think he wants people to be amazed like he has some kind of weird power.  But we're obsessed with how he sounds.  Yeah.  All right.  Squishy clue.  All right.  Yeah, that would be easy to do.  You know that.  Oh, God, that's amazing.  What?  I never thought of that.  He puts the sound in later, and he looks like a fucking amazing magical guy.  Clued.  All right.  Here is a new one.  We played the square-shaped clue yesterday.  This one has something to do with a hole.  Oh.  This video is being recorded by T-Chase. 
[02:10:30]  I'm recording this.  Recording this in September 2011.  Oh.  This is a psychokinesis weather control video by T-Chase.  Where I'm able to control clouds and wind.  In this case, I'm going to try to attempt to make holes in a cloud by psychic energy. 
[02:11:00]  See, I'm trading the camera now on this cloud.  You can see more on my website on this, but I'm going to try to make a hole in this cloud by psychic power as you watch.  Make a hole in this cloud.  I'm looking at here now.  Hole.  Make a hole in the cloud.  Make a hole in the cloud.  Why is he talking like that?  I don't know.  That's why we play this.  We don't know.  I don't know why he's doing that. 
[02:11:30]  Make a hole in the cloud.  And I don't think he has confidence in what he's doing.  That's why I keep saying the cloud we're looking at now.  That's like subliminal in his mind.  Like, oh, fuck.  You know?  Because I don't think you would say that.  Is that part of his process to start talking like that, I guess?  Yeah, it is.  It's part of his magical process.  We don't know anything about it.  It's part of his magic.  Yeah.  I'm going to try to make a hole in this cloud. 
[02:12:00]  Make a hole in the cloud.  Enlarge in the hole in the cloud.  I'm still breathing.  Yeah.  Make a hole in the cloud.  He's an asshole.  I love this guy.  He's an asshole. 
[02:12:30]  Make a hole in the cloud.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Oh, look.  He's doing it.  Enlarge in the hole in the cloud.  Make a hole in the cloud.  Make a hole in the cloud. 
[02:13:00]  Enlarge in the hole in the cloud.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Enlarge the hole in the cleat.  Enlarge the hole in the cleat. 
[02:13:30]  Enlarge the hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make the hole grow bigger.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make the hole grow larger.  Oh, it's so funny. 
[02:14:00]  Why is he saying that?  Make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat, make a hole in the cleat

[02:20:00]  I taped it because I was like just in case the guys know that he already snores and this is a joke  I want to have this on tape and if it's not cool then I won't do it and then as soon as they said  oh we all fucking know that I was like okay well I have audio my mom recorded me before my brother  so it's like it's oh I'd love to hear it and you always wake up when I'm trying to record you  yeah you're paranoid when you're around me I think he senses me yeah also to wake up and turn his head  real fast yeah who do I forward this to what's your email let me write it in well we might dickbag at 
[02:20:30]  I have four of them but the fourth one is the best one that's the most consistent  let's just go with the fourth one yeah that's what I'm doing cool and you can if you listen  closely you can hear me laughing in the bed uh I stay there really laughing and then I got up at  one point to like try to come in the room to record not come in the room but stand in the  oh wow Joe what's that about uh standing door with a hammer like sling blade yeah a little middle 
[02:21:00]  uh middle of the night visit yeah my pants were down so I couldn't I was gonna trip  what do we got here well why don't you come on in Joe DeRosa rolling taps this corner of the bed  did you wait till the mess is loaded yeah before I go to bed I do my yoga I hear people downstairs  talking I just scream at them to shut up yeah you can't scream if you're doing yoga well that's my  version of yoga you talk he's all angry during yoga you yell crazy things when you're sleeping  sometimes too oh my god yeah I didn't get that on tape night terrors yeah I don't know 
[02:21:30]  what's going on at Roland's house man what's going on in his mind fuck his house yeah he like yelled  out some mumbly shit when he was sleeping and I was like yeah that's what's going on and he also does  like I think you can hear a little bit on here like you snore like the way like the three stooges  snore like when you exhale you're literally like  does he have sleep apnea uh I think you might be a candidate for it but I think you should get 
[02:22:00]  checked man I stepped through it I'm good you got a hard snore because you don't snore  hard snore you don't snore consistently which is what would scare me about it it sounds like  it gets disrupted it sounds like disrupted disruptive excuse me like like you're breathing 
[02:22:30]  and all of a sudden it gets interrupted yeah yeah and then there's like that's apnea that's sleep  apnea yeah that's okay that's good I don't want you to die in your sleep man I won't the alcohol  will preserve me all right well do you have it there yeah I'm just scanning through it I think it's two  minutes but I think there's a good amount on there I kind of like the tension of uh the silence  yeah I kind of want to hear wait the whole track's two minutes forget let's just go with it let's go  with it we'll fill up the we'll fill up uh the dead air because it does it feels like it feels very 
[02:23:00]  ghost hunters yeah yeah okay no it's from the bedroom so it's not that far yeah okay it echoes because  I have no furniture oh okay just  all right waiting yeah it is ghost hunter 
[02:23:30]  where is it where is it it's coming oh man that's ghostly  there's I think there's more

[02:24:30]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  i was just laughing at himself  i don't know that might be it for that i don't know there might be a little more at the end  that was i can't remember that last one was pretty loud from the other room jesus christ 
[02:25:00]  holy this one this this other one i yeah  how did you sleep i didn't fucking sleep with that going on i slept for like 90 minutes  wow that's a racket or or it's like an animal sleeping wow dude holy fuck i slept for like  90 minutes i i just was too lazy to shut the door like i just was like yeah who cares

[02:26:00]  consistent snort yeah that's why i think you should get tested aids  you could use that noise in monster movies yeah 
[02:26:30]  that would literally scare me like i would be scared in the room it's night time you're hearing  frightening  petrifying  yeah and i think there's a little more okay just tracking through roland's snort 
[02:27:00]  are you talking  it's very animal like yeah  i know it sounds like he's talking during the exhales right yeah he's like whispering in tongues or

[02:49:00]  episode and i'm sitting here telling the world he's dumb well what did he do what's he in trouble for  this is you have the audio you have is the abridged version of just the offensive audio so what is it  basically they did like a little viral video type commercial for pop chips that's a mock uh  uh it's a mock dating website uh-huh and ashton's playing a whole bunch of different characters  one of them is an indian character and he's doing an accent and he painted his face all brown like 
[02:49:30]  oh all right now why is that bad because indian people normally have darker skin and if you're  portraying one why wouldn't you use makeup to would kind of make the illusion but we're not  allowed to point out the obvious anymore yeah the indian folks don't like him in brown face  and so pop chips pulled the ad and apologized i love how that's racist but seven years of that  fucking character on that 70s show was fine that fucking immigrant being like man i don't understand  the country yeah that was okay that's fine racist oh wow really that's all it was and black people 
[02:50:00]  in white face like you know that fucking right like white chicks what is that white chicks with  the wayans brothers what example does he have of that i have white chicks the wayans brother  and we can't get past that because we said no to the wayan brothers and i know it's because  they did white chicks i just can't have the guys i don't want that did white chicks on our show  there were three scenes in that movie that made me laugh and i was shocked that it had that many  really all right maybe i can't believe how not funny those guys are anymore it's they were not 
[02:50:30]  funny living color was so funny it's great scary movie one was fucking hilarious and then some god  don't be a menace was fucking hilarious some goddamn switch went off and it's like the whole family  isn't funny just became unfunny wow i mean you might be right though i it's like i i admire them  so i feel bad i'm honestly i'm not trying to be provocative and shit on them i'm just like i don't  understand what happened yeah what happened to the family they get too hollywood nobody is funny 
[02:51:00]  in that they just get too fucking hollywood not taking any chances anymore because you know too  many people you're like oh yeah maybe maybe i shouldn't go down that road yeah i got i watched  the tv land awards when they did the living color right the honored in living color one of the  shows one of the shows i got like goosebumps like seeing them all on stage again together and see  and jim carrey and and and wow you know david allen greer and i was like oh this is so cool the show  was so fucking good and then you're like you think about the last like three movies they made that

[02:56:30]  on the planet i'm nigel i'm seeking higher planes of consciousness higher planes of consciousness  money creates taste and i have lots of both okay go away james so who am i i am dar my name is  swordfish uh i'm looking for something hot and spicy like kardashian he's terrible i would give that dog a  move just that would i describe me i'm an extraordinary lover i can also without even looking tell you whether 
[02:57:00]  you have an innie or an outie belly button so my whole life is detail higher lower he's terrible  i was in a milking contest i love poetry and i won it huh i'm sorry i was holding my breath  to look this is offensive just because it stinks and every character is a rip off of somebody the  fucking white hair guy's deeter from sprockets this is poopoo this is a magical feather that was 
[02:57:30]  given to me by a shaman would you like a jeep poopoo it's okay they are kosher she only is kosher  yes  and i bet they were going crazy that he ate it oh yeah oh wow your waiting room's like a freak show  are we all in the same category life is short well shouldn't get in trouble for that though no  that's that had nothing like i said it's more offensive that it just is horrible and they yanked 
[02:58:00]  the spot yeah more knee-jerk reactions to fucking nothing for nothing what the  fuck there's no reason happening it's fucking up comedy is what it's doing it's  it's fucking ridiculous there's no reason for that so what playing an indian guy in a  a montage of a bunch of shit where he was wearing makeup that's why that's why guys like tarantino  or the shit where they're just i saw an interview with him once where he goes he goes people tell  me all the time he goes i don't understand when people say you can't do stuff yeah because people 
[02:58:30]  say to me all the time i'll tell them what i'm gonna do in my new movie they'll be like you can't  do that it's offensive he goes go fuck yourself i can do whatever i want yeah yeah and he  fucking does it and he operates outside of the system like nobody can fuck with that guy  and it's but then ah that's so tame didn't spike lee say he used nigger in his movies too much the  word yes uh and and he got all like and quentin's like fuck you because you do right gives a shit 
[02:59:00]  makes the movies funny come on that's fucking spike is so hateable that scene with the  fucking animal with the wolf coming over i really uh was like i'm i'm a i'm a fan of a lot of spike  lee's movies uh and i was a big fan of him for a long time but like this whole thing that he just  did where he like tweeted out oh yeah george zimmerman's address it was like dude are you out  of your fucking mind what are you doing anyone else anyone else would get a lot of fucking trouble 
[02:59:30]  for that yes they certainly would have got kicked off twitter at the very least but yeah it's like  spike lee i guess he gets to slide gets a pass yeah regardless of your this is what kills me about  that it's like regardless of your whole what your opinion is in that whole discussion it's like dude  you don't take vigilante tactics yeah that's vigilante shit like that's like we're gonna go find  this guy and pull it's like dude what are you doing yeah what are you gonna find him to and and  have people discuss things with him i'm amazed so for violence i'm amazed it wasn't more outrage 
[03:00:00]  are you really are you really amazed well i guess not after a while you're not but i mean  you should be amazed i guess i mean way more should have happened but i can't take the just the entire  state and it goes back to to what we were talking about early on with with romney and obama it's it's  like the both sides of that coin make me fucking sick yeah on one side it's guilty bleeding heart  white people uh trying to support supporting somebody that that they know isn't effective 
[03:00:30]  in getting done what they think needs to be done or whatever but they're so fucking guilty  yeah uh and stubborn that they're just going to keep supporting this person and then on the other side  is just empty-headed fucking white people thinking that a guy like mit romney is really  on their side or actually gives a shit it's so fucking ridiculous meanwhile both of these  fucking guys have the same exact it kills me when romney goes obama couldn't fix the economy 
[03:01:00]  but i will oh will you will you yeah yeah exactly they all do both sides it's easy to say that  that's what they but that's all so easy you just got to hope you're in office when the economy  swings up right because the president isn't doing shit to help the fucking economy david mamet wrote  an article where he compared the bush administration to the kennedy administration it was un-fucking  believable he was like bush bush gets blamed for iraq uh current war in iraq uh kennedy is 
[03:01:30]  responsible for vietnam bush was in bed with the oil companies kennedy was in bed with the mob  bush stole the election in florida kennedy stole the election in west virginia it's all the same  horseshit yeah none of it matters the only thing that matters is if when you and i meet at the water  cooler we can get along and like work together and respect each other's opinions yeah and it was the  best fucking breakdown i've ever heard of it outside of the carlin thing about how he doesn't vote or 
[03:02:00]  whatever that's a great one but uh it's you know we're we're you know the best president uh in the  that in history might be some guy that's just fucking broke in the middle of fucking nebraska  somewhere but has no ability to become the president not it doesn't have the money doesn't have that but  might be like the best guy for the job yeah we always get the choice of the two guys that have millions  upon millions of dollars to throw away and millions and millions and there's no you know 
[03:02:30]  it's like really the guys have so the prerequisite is you have to be fucking loaded or be able to raise  a fuckload of money to be president i think it's just bullshit it's just so it's so ridiculous the  whole shit now too where the republicans are bitching about and i'm not saying this to attack  the republicans or to attack the the left it's i'm just saying it to say it's just the same poor  shit like the fact that the republicans are going oh well well barack is um he's boasting that he 
[03:03:00]  killed obama yeah he's proud of it it's like that's osama you are you what would i say that the president  killed obama oh sorry i'm sorry i meant to say excuse me the um yeah it's like that's what you guys  fucking do it's it's it's all sides do the exact same thing it's two tattletales yeah yeah i didn't  do it he did it no look what he's doing it's just like when uh zeppelin got busted for stealing  all those songs right and when they would interview jimmy page you'd be like robert said it was fine 
[03:03:30]  they would interview robert planton you'd be like fucking go talk to page he's the one that  same fucking thing yeah they made those songs their own though they  fucking stole and they're thieving fucking limey pricks but i get i love zeppelin as much as  anybody i think back then it was acceptable yeah yeah that's the only argument i have on that  a lot of those guys coming up they would they would listen to the blues they were obsessed with  the blues they'd find these obscure blue songs that mainstream america didn't really know yet and 
[03:04:00]  they would redo them here's the truth of the fucking matter credit in the writing credits gives a  shit and then page also stole songs from the yardbirds his former yeah that's true he just made  some zeppelin songs maybe he wrote them for the yardbirds uh there was a lot of argument that he was  only co-writer i don't remember because i don't know zeppelin's catalog well enough to be able to yeah  i i think you'd have never heard those fucking blues songs anyway no one was ever going to hear 
[03:04:30]  they're fucking that's what i mean some guy fucking i've been a long time since a rock and roll  that's what it doesn't mean it's okay to steal it but i'm saying those no one would it was gone  anyway but if a tree falls and no one's there to hear it oh god no a band like zeppelin brought a  lot of those songs to light that i think that's right they were just completely buried but they  didn't give the guy credit or royalties that's the shitty part what upside is it for them to 
[03:05:00]  say we didn't write this makes you look like faggots and back then yeah the band had to write  their fucking songs makes you look like faggots you know why because you're a bunch of fucking  faggots and that's why i'm angry about it and they should have bought one less castle and and do  the right thing and use that money to take care of the blues guys i don't mean by the way i don't  mean faggot as gay exactly are you sure are you sure we just use that word i'm not a context that  well i used to use it with my friends you know richard how pissed would you be okay now listen i 
[03:05:30]  didn't i didn't love did we play the spirit song for you yet by who led zeppelin well oh boy did we  do that's a great one no what's the spirits oh my god play that play that fucking can you find  that really please play that fucking thing you want to hear stairway to heaven before stairway to  heaven oh oh yeah i've heard this holy fuck fucking see holy fuck it's ridiculous that it's the same 
[03:06:00]  fucking what was the name of the spirit song that came we did this whole bit it came out before um  stairway all right which is there's a hundred different spirit songs oh is that yeah you guys  kind of you guys broke the guy that did this we were kind of um i don't know i i i take pride in  the fact we were the first you know mainstream show that did this do you remember who did it  we did this we did this years ago what was the name of the spirit song somebody help me uh let's  say jesus help me i'm looking i'm looking that's it isn't it help me jesus i'm looking huh this is a 
[03:06:30]  remix uh song similarities yeah oh yeah the song was called taurus i think taurus by spirits and then  it was stairway to heaven yeah okay thank you listen to this okay it's hilarious ten years after  you quit smoking oh boy that's stairway to heaven uh we could all hear it there you go all right  this is taurus by spirit yeah it's ridiculous how do you haven't heard yet huh 
[03:07:00]  plant page said we don't need all this nonsense i know we'll just go to the riff we'll put our own  shit in right stupid uh ron burgundy anchorman flute we're gonna do an hour next time you're  ever we're gonna do an hour on the flute all right all right all right oh yeah flute

Something's on you.  Hilarious.  It's nature's way.  Poor Spirit, man.  No one bought Spirit albums.  It's so funny, dude. 
[03:13:00]  It's nature's way.  It's saving you.  I remember this song, man.  It's nature's way.  You know?  Yeah.  It's nature's way.  It's saving you.  I know you're talking.  Isn't that amazing?  I got a good one.  I think I've actually mentioned this one on the show before, years ago.  Pull up Sister Golden Hair, please, by America.  Uh-huh.  We just need to hear the verse.  Sister Golden Hair. 
[03:13:30]  This is a great tune.  Remember this one, too?  Yeah, I kind of like this song.  Yeah, this is a good tune, man.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Ray Parker Jr. and Huey Lewis.  We know that one.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  That was a big one.  This is another one that nobody...  This one, nobody talked about this one.  Well, I tried to make it Sunday, but I got so damn depressed.  All right.  That's all you need? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  Now pull up Green Day, Scattered.  All right.  No, Green Day wouldn't do this.  Oh, boy.  Not Green Day.  Oh, they did.  No.  I don't know if I ever heard this one.  Let's just wait for the verse.  It's a little heavier.  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  Well, I'm just a scattered picture.  I am on my bed. 
[03:14:30]  I'm on my bed.  I'm on my bed.  I'm on my bed.  I'm on my bed.  I'm on my bed.  It's a rest of my bed.  Wow.  I tried to make it.  That's a little loud.  That's a little more energy.  That's hilarious.  We'll cover it up with, yeah, volume and energy.  Wow.  That's a good one.  Joe Satriani in Viva La Vida by Coldplay.  Yeah.  He sued him over that one.  I think he lost that one, right?  I think so.  Huey Lewis won against Ray Parker Jr., didn't he? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  And then there was a famous one where John Fogerty, what was it?  He had to sue himself because he ripped off CCR when he was in CCR.  But he wrote the song, so it was like.  Yeah, his company.  He literally had to sue himself.  That one was really confusing.  The record label, he left CCR.  Old Man Down the Road, I think it was.  Yeah, he went CCR and went solo.  The record label sued him for saying, you're ripping off the Credence sound.  We own Credence.  You're ripping off yourself.  Because it's him. 
[03:15:30]  We own your old self.  So he had to go into court and defend why his solo stuff sounded different from Credence.  Right.  And he actually brought a guitar into the courtroom and had to show everybody, look, the Credence  songs do this and my songs do that.  Wow.  But he was the creator of both.  Just amazing.  To fucking lawyers.  Fucking assholes.  That's one of those classics like, it was him and his brother and they fucking hate each  other.  Yeah.  That's like an Oasis thing where it's like.  I found a fucking video of Oasis. 
[03:16:00]  It's too long to watch, but.  You find good shit.  Dude.  You really do.  You gotta.  Thank you.  Can you find this shit?  Can you text me?  Yeah.  Because I'm bored at home babysitting.  I tweeted this out.  Help me out.  I tweeted this out.  I wrote, I always thought I hated this guy, but it turns out I actually love him.  And it was just a 12 minute video of the lead singer of Oasis doing like asshole  things in interviews and in public.  I was.  It was a montage.  I was laughing so hard.  Can we get a piece of it before we leave?  Yeah.  If it's good, we'll put it on our Facebook page.  I think Liam's the singer. 
[03:16:30]  Liam Gallagher.  Liam or Noel.  I don't know.  They really are assholes.  And you don't like the band.  Nah, I'm not a big fan of Oasis.  The whiny shit.  Champagne, soup, and yalva.  So type in Liam Gallagher's greatest moments or something like that.  There it is.  Best and funniest moments.  Are you singing so Sally can wait?  No, I walked to him and I said, yeah, I reckon you should fucking sing.  So Sally can wait.  Which is the truth. 
[03:17:00]  Did he write that lyric?  Yes, of course.  Because he fucking did.  And he reckons I was, you know.  But he said, all right, let's just say for argument's sake.  Right.  He alluded to the fact.  They're fucking arguing about who wrote the two lyrics.  The two brothers.  Jesus Christ.  You should do.  So what were you singing at the time?  I don't know, I was singing, I don't know.  I don't know, I don't know.  So which one's the asshole?  I don't know.  The one on the right.  This is the first clip.  Right then, who's first then? 
[03:17:30]  It's definitely going to work.  It's got to be you there with that weird haircut there.  How many haircuts you got there for?  You know.  I'd like to thank all the people who voted for us.  I thought we were going to win nothing, you know what I mean?  To say, you never know these days.  You know, you know, I come because, you know, you get invited, you know what I mean?  And, you know.  And if I want to have won anything, I'd smash the gaff up. 
[03:18:00]  What do you think is the worst fashion mistake someone said?  Have you seen someone that's so, like, ooh, like, so fashionable and it's really doing  your head, didn't it?  It looks hideous.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Who?  You.  Oh, you.  I had The Darkness on my show on Friday.  Whoopee.  And then I asked them if they wanted to ask you a question.  Whoopee.  I have to say, I am a bit nervous because I've seen some interviews and I've seen what he  does to journalists.  Leave it there.  Just you tell me what he said.  With massive Oasis fans, does he like The Darkness?  Do I like The Darkness? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  I like that first song when it come out and then they said something about me.  Nah, I couldn't be arse with him now.  I can't wait to bump into him one day.  Apparently he lives nearby.  Yeah.  I like that silly song that they come out with first time.  Made me laugh.  Made me laugh.  So made him laugh.  And then they got a bit serious and started getting a bit big for the boots.  Started swagging off the boys.  So, no.  What's the next question?  You're being hyped as the best band around at the moment.  It's a fact.  It's a fact.  Do you have to be feeling something every time to act? 
[03:19:00]  I do.  I've got to be honest.  I've got to, I can't write songs about being young and unemployed and being 21 because I'm  not.  You know.  Might be like songs about me.  Been sweating on and very good looking.  There's a lot of bands out there styled and that.  And you can see them a mile off like Coldplay, you know what I mean?  And you know they don't buy their own clothes.  Yeah.  And they should.  They should buy Pretty Green. 
[03:19:30]  What about Coldplay?  Coldplay, what about them?  Do you like Coldplay?  All right.  Just okay?  All right.  Except they don't, they don't, they don't do it for me that much.  They're not rock and roll enough, man.  Yeah.  They're all right.  They live all around the corner from me, so I don't say too much.  They're neighbors.  They used to come around and, you know, give me a paper cut or something.  You should have a paper cut or something.  I suck.  He's bull.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  Jesus.  I'm going to watch the whole thing.  It goes on and on.  No, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  It goes on and on.  It's good for him, though.  Because I think that's how he is.  There's a clip where he wins it.  He's not fucking acting.  No, I love it, dude.  There's a clip where he wins an award, and he's doing it just to piss everybody off.  He's getting booed, and he's fucking wiping his ass with the award to the audience.  And I'm like, that's fucking hilarious that he's doing that.  He knows how to piss everybody off, and he's just running with it.  Yeah.  I mean, he's saying that Coldplay isn't rock and roll enough. 
[03:20:30]  Oasis was kind of one of the times, right?  You know what's funny?  After I saw this, I started going through the Oasis catalog and listening to stuff.  And they were way better than I ever kind of thought they were.  Oh, I like some of their stuff.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I thought it was all ballads and stuff, but it's not.  Maybe I just don't know enough about the band.  Yeah.  The band?  The band.  All right.  It's a fact.  Joe, we're going to start our weekend.  Thank you for coming in today.  Absolutely.  All the way from Philly and sleeping on, well, no, in Roland's bed.  He gave up his bed, had a little sleepover, had to deal with the snoring just to come in here. 
[03:21:00]  And we appreciate it.  Make sure your mom knows we're thinking about her.  Thanks for having me, man.  Seriously, guys.  Yeah, Joe, you're always a fucking pleasure having Joe on.  This was such a welcome relief and break from everything at home.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I really appreciate being here.  Very stressful.  Thank you.  And we've got, what, Caroline's Memorial Day weekend sort of around there?  Yeah, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, I'll be there.  And, uh, Warner Sound channel on YouTube. 
[03:21:30]  Pilot's coming out that week.  All right, Joe.  Yeah.  Uh, remember, uh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  Gold dip roses are all the fucking rage.  Oh, right.  You know what?  They're all the rage, man.  I think that's the move on Mother's Day, isn't it?  I mean, I don't think you should send your mom, like, I don't know, chocolate-covered  stuff.  Oh, well.  Or flowers.  Or some dumb, dumb pendant.  Hey, wait a minute.  I really, what?  But before, you were saying. 
[03:22:00]  No, no, no, no.  But I heard before.  I told all the people what I was going to do.  Oh.  You said an hour later, trust me, it's going to be the shit.  Oh.  Guess what?  It's time for the good shit.  It's time for the shit.  This is the good shit for Mother's Day.  Good shit.  Uh, here's a question, Joe.  What's the most important holiday?  Mother's Day.  You're supposed to guess Christmas.  Oh.  Well, I, you know, Christmas, because I also get things.  Not Christmas.  And then you have to guess Valentine's Day.  Valentine's Day.  Not Valentine's Day. 
[03:22:30]  Father's Day.  Mother's Day.  Mother's Day.  Jesus.  All right.  Mother's Day.  Do you love your mom?  Joe loves his mom.  I do.  Yes.  He's made some sacrifices to make sure mommy's okay.  I love my mom.  It's a fact.  Me, mom.  Fact.  100% fucking fact.  Steven Singer, we're talking about the famous gold-dipped roses, of course.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We like these roses, for sure.  Lots of different colors, by the way, besides the gold-dipped rose.  It's the perfect gift for mom, your mother-in-law, or the mother of your children. 
[03:23:00]  A real long-stem rose dipped in 24-karat pure gold.  The gift lasts forever, and it's only 69 bucks.  That's 69 bucks.  Steven Singer's real long-stem rose comes, shipped in a beautiful gift box.  Yeah, they have a nice display with this thing.  Yeah.  And the personalized Mother's Day card.  Oh, geez, over there.  That sounds nice, dear.  He comes up every holiday with a bunch of them for us, and I pass them around, man, and people  seem to really, really like them.  The gold roses?  The gold roses, but they have different colors.  Joe, you want to know about the different colors? 
[03:23:30]  The gold?  You could choose from violet pearl.  I don't understand.  What does that signify?  I don't know.  By the way, it's a gold rose, but it's not the color of gold?  The gold roses, like, that's one of his main ones, but he's like, you know what, maybe  people don't like the gold-dipped rose, you know, so he's got other colors for people.  But they're gold-dipped, but then he accents them with various colors.  Oh, but I've seen ones where they're just gold-dipped.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he puts colors on after.  Classic gold one.  Gotcha. 
[03:24:00]  Pearl symbolizes admiration.  He decided that, I guess.  He's decided what the colors mean.  It's admiration.  I've never heard this before.  It must be nice.  Fucking fact.  This guy is full of himself.  I love him now.  Fucking fact.  Admiration, you fuck.  But he's full of himself.  Oh, yeah.  All these colors, he's deciding for us what the colors mean.  Thank you, Steven.  Stop.  Peach symbolizes appreciation.  Really?  I didn't know that.  He made it up.  It never has symbolized that. 
[03:24:30]  All right, good.  He made it up.  Steven Singer's a liar.  How about, Steven, they're going to go to your website, and they're going to pick the color  because it looks cool.  That's right.  That's right.  A nice color.  It's like, I like peach, but I don't admire her very much.  I'm in a quandary.  And the classic old gold, which symbolizes respect and eternal love.  Oh.  No, that, no, man.  That symbolizes rich.  That is.  That symbolizes taste.  That symbolizes, I got some of that money.  It's money.  Go roses.  Listen to all of us, please.
