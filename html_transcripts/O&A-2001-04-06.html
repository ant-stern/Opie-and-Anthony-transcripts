<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a review of new, "ambiguously gay" sweepers created by their producer, Jimmy.  The sweepers contained sexually suggestive dialogue and sound effects implying homosexual acts between Opie and Anthony. The hosts debated their use, playing several for the listeners and reacting with amusement and discomfort.  This transitioned into a discussion about Anthony's refusal to return a loaned Lexus, detailing his past success at evading repossession for nine months. A repo agent, Chris, called in to correct their use of "repo man," preferring "recovery agent."

John Valby, a comedian, then joined the show.  They reminisced about past pranks, including a false report of Boston Mayor Menino's death. Valby performed original songs, some containing explicit lyrics that triggered a discussion about the station's delay and censorship policies.  A call with "Darker Patty," a 45-year-old virgin, followed, leading to a sexually suggestive conversation about her lack of sexual experience and fantasies. The hosts jokingly attempted to coach her on sex.

A segment featuring a caller nicknamed "Stalker Patty" then aired, detailing her graphic sexual fantasies involving U2's The Edge. The hosts engaged in explicit questioning, punctuated by seemingly genuine audio clips from The Edge containing vulgar remarks.  The hosts' reactions varied between laughter and disgust.  This was followed by Adam Ferrera and Jay Marco joining the studio.  Marco hosted "Gay Marco's Alternative Lifestyle Radio Program," which included sexually suggestive jokes, discussions of gay pornography, explicit phone calls, a game called "Guess What's in My Crack," explicit musical interludes, and crude comments about Regis Philbin and his new co-host.  John Valby returned, contributing to the sexually explicit jokes and songs.

Gay Marco later played a game with callers suggesting offensive names, including "Ash Nazi," "Sea Dumpster," and "AIDS courier." He then promoted his column.  The show shifted to a discussion about newly released tapes of Richard Nixon and Donald Rumsfeld containing racially charged comments. The hosts and a caller, Chris, discussed the tapes, punctuated by the hosts mimicking Nixon and Agnew with exaggerated, offensive racial slurs and impersonations.

"Jackie the Knife Girl" was then in studio with Rob, who used knives to scratch her body while she reacted enthusiastically.  The hosts and others provided graphic, sexually suggestive commentary on the event.  A call with a Frank Caliendo impersonation of Brian Regan followed.  They discussed Regan's career, interspersed with calls and humor, including talk about a "Kiss Dwarves" performance and politically correct terminology for little people. The hosts discussed avoiding politically incorrect language, and Regan shared an anecdote about an emergency room visit. More impersonations and banter concluded this segment.

The show concluded with a segment where a caller, Lexi, asked for children's party game ideas. The hosts jokingly suggested dangerous versions of "pin the tail on the donkey" and "musical chairs," escalating the descriptions to highlight potential injuries and conflicts.  One of the hosts recounted a confused reaction to an enthusiastic audience response to a joke involving a jugular vein, describing the crowd's reaction as extreme and using the word "retarded."  The segment ended with a joke setup.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  8 minutes of pure adrenaline. It's Ben.  W. Ben E. W. now concludes its broadcast day.  Stay tuned for W. O. N. A. on 1027 W. N. E. W.  O. P. O. P. O. P. O. P. O. P.  Anthony. Anthony. Anthony.  1027 W. N. E. W.  Friday! 
[00:00:30]  Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, Anthony.  This is going to be a little awkward, but we have some new sweepers for our radio show.  New sweepers. We always like the new sweepers.  Those clever little things that are put together by production.  Let's sort of give you a little taste for the show.  It's put together by Jimmy.  Yeah.  And Jimmy does a great, great job. 
[00:01:00]  All those incredible sweepers you hear going in and out of commercials, that's all of Jim's work.  You've heard the ones like the feature of maybe Louis Black talking about how he'll go to court with the girls from the voya bus.  That whole thing, the montage of me, Adam, and Jeffrey Ross imitating Louis, you know, and then put in with the music, things like that.  Well, he's got a new concept.  A new concept.  He has O&A gay sweepers.  Look, they're his ambiguously gay sweepers for the show. 
[00:01:30]  I thought we went that route already.  A little concept that he's been working on.  And, you know, the guy works really hard on these things.  Okay.  We were going to smash him and just move on with the show.  You know, maple sauce works hard, too.  Yeah.  It doesn't make the picture good.  Adam, do you have to leave in five minutes or something?  No, I'll ask you to drive a car.  Five? 
[00:02:00]  Five?  Why are you so busy?  I have to go.  I'm at Town Hall tonight for the Jail of Wilson, man.  I know.  Okay.  Well, what time is that?  The car's going to come get me.  I have to go and watch.  You have to do cars, though?  Jesus Christ.  I don't go to my pal.  Don't talk, Mr. Lexus.  You're going to stop?  Look, it's not mine.  Anthony has to give back his Lexus.  Fine.  I'm not giving it back.  I remember laying under that bug going, the oil's going in my eye.  I have a Volkswagen.  Yeah.  Look.  Look. 
[00:02:30]  Why?  I was supposed to give the Lexus back today.  I'm not giving it back.  I'm telling you, I'm not giving it back.  He refuses to give the Lexus back.  Possession, nine-tenths.  It's mine.  I have it.  I'm used to this.  Remember my Monza, GMAC?  Uh-huh.  GMAC financing.  For some reason, they get a little upset when you didn't send a payment.  Right.  And GMAC turned into, get me Anthony's car.  Yeah.  I hid my car nine months without one payment.  Nine months.  I was like 22.  Did the repo guy finally get it?  Finally got it.  Someone ratted me out. 
[00:03:00]  He had the Philadelphia experiment.  Like, I can cloak this.  I did.  I was trying to do this on a cloaking device.  Wait.  Slow down.  So you had a car for nine months and they finally got it?  I had a-  How did you hide it from everyone?  I had a Monza.  Right.  And I couldn't afford the payments.  But I didn't care.  You know, I really didn't go for-  I had a crappy job.  I was a kid.  And the repo guy came to where I worked.  Came to my job.  I was doing some machine shop work for pennies. 
[00:03:30]  And he said, look, I'm taking your car.  And I begged, pleaded.  I'm just like, look, I will pay you.  You come here tomorrow.  It's where I work.  I will give you a check.  Just, I'm working.  You can come here.  You can get it tomorrow.  But I have a check for you tomorrow.  I then went in and quit my job.  Because I figured I could get another job with a car.  But I couldn't get to the job I had without a car.  So I had to leave.  You had a truck.  So I had a car.  Right.  So I just pictured this big bruiser getting there the next day.  I mean, he made it his mission to get this car. 
[00:04:00]  Nine months I went without them getting my car.  I had a different address.  I would park it in train station parking lots, take the train to my house.  I mean, this is what I was doing to hide this car.  And then someone ratted me out for like a bounty.  Almost like Mafia Mom.  And so they finally got my car.  But how did they get it?  I mean, how did they know where you were parking it?  Somebody ratted me out.  You didn't even have a home back then. 
[00:04:30]  I was great with this.  Yeah, for like a month or two, I was living out of the car.  And it was horrible.  Very, very hard time.  Where did they finally repoed it?  It was in one of the train station parking lots.  Someone spotted me.  That guy, that big bruiser guy had a mission.  I effed him over and he was pissed.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on?  You don't like to be called a repo man.  We are recovery agents, all right?  You don't like to be called a repo man.  No, it's degrading.  We're recovery agents, all right? 
[00:05:00]  Hey, did you hear about the repo guy that took the...  I just heard this in the news.  He hooked up a car when the guy went into a bank to do some of his banking.  And there were two kids in the car.  He hooks it up and just takes it away.  And now he's in trouble, man.  You can't be taking the kids along with the car.  Hey, Chris, next time you have to recover a car, give us a call, okay?  All right.  Recovery agent.  You're a repo man.  It's a guy with a Slim Jim.  They're car thieves that I actually figured out a way to do it legally. 
[00:05:30]  Did you ever see repo man in the movie?  Yeah, it was a little too spacey, a little too weird for me.  I like it a lot.  A little too weird.  Pablo Picasso would never be called a hole.  Look at you doing lines for a movie.  Thank you.  Drink.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  All right, you want to do the gay sweepers, Anthony?  Yeah, what is this now?  They made sweepers.  And based on the ambiguously gay duo theme from...  Yeah, SNL cartoons.  No, I don't want Jimmy insulted, because he does all the production for our show, and  he does a great job.  He really does. 
[00:06:00]  But I don't know if we would just throw these sweepers into the general rotation.  I think it would, I don't know, it would perk some people up out there.  And I don't know if we want to go down that road.  The old dirt road.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, let's give a listen, and we'll all judge together.  All right?  We have to decide if these should go into the rotation.  All right.  Okay?  So listen along.  They're really gay.  Great.  They're extremely gay.  That's a winner.  It's our turn of the barrel, Anthony.  Here it goes. 
[00:06:30]  We weren't even going to play them on the air.  Let's hear what Jimmy put together.  I don't even want to push this button.  I haven't heard this yet.  You've heard them?  Oof.  All right.  Oof.  Okay.  Are you ready?  No, but let's go.  All right, here.  Are you sure?  Okay, here we go.  Give it a try.  I love it already. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Moral?  Yes.  Suck it at you, whore.  What a mess.  The M.A.G. with the gay duo.  1027 WNEW.  That's a winner.  All right.  Look.  Mm-hmm.  What?  What is that?  I don't know.  Maybe Jimmy's mad at us.  He gave them to, like, Ben and Rick and said, here, put these in the rotation. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just let it fly.  It's me sucking O.P.  S***.  All right.  I had to dump out of myself.  Great.  Great thing.  As I was saying, it's me sucking O.P.  S***.  Great.  Great sweeper.  Yeah, that's not real ambiguous.  You pretty much know what's going on.  You're pretty much doing the thing.  Yeah, there's no room for doubt. 
[00:08:00]  That's blatant.  He just wanted to throw it in.  Be part of the rotation.  Rotation?  Without us commenting about it.  All of a sudden, we would go to commercial, and that's what you would hear.  Jay from Nutley.  Um, what?  Joe from the Upper West Side.  Way to suck that sea, Ant.  Woo, that's a winner.  Are you kidding?  There's two more, Anthony.  Oh, there's more.  Yeah.  Gay, gay, gay, three to seven. 
[00:08:30]  People are loving this.  That sucks.  Literally.  Are you kidding?  This guy, that was the funniest effing thing, man.  Oh, yeah, it's funny.  I'm on the receiving end.  Definitely put it in.  Freaking funny.  Hold on a second now, Ant.  We might have a problem.  We might have to put it in rotation.  Max, what's up?  Yeah, Ant, you're not kidding.  You're on the receiving end.  Max. 
[00:09:00]  Those things are freaking funny.  All right, thank you.  Ant, did you swallow?  Yeah, Doug from Springfield.  Doug?  What's up?  You guys are doing your next road show in the city, right?  In the village.  Christopher Street.  Yeah.  That's a great sweeper.  Doug wants to ask Ed if he took it all.  But, Nick.  Stretch your mouth.  A pain is it.  A giant?  Oh, you weren't like that.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  How's that for a chopper?  Oh, oh, oh. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  Well, now you've got to play the other one.  All right, we'll play the other one.  Great.  Kevin?  Oh, listen, then.  You guys have got to keep that indignantly gay duo, man.  It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  All I want to know is who's the wife and who's the husband.  Easy.  See?  See, it's our turn in the barrel.  Oh, and gay.  Three to seven.  How many ribs did Anthony take?  Referring to yesterday's show.  Very good.  Anthony, your Pottery Barn catalog's on the way.  You want to hear the second one?  We have three.  Yeah.  Here's the second one. 
[00:10:00]  It's supposed to just go in a rotation.  Like, it's no big deal.  Okay.  Here it is.  OPM, OPM, Anthony.  The Epic U is the gay duo.  I am not gay.  I want hard C.  I'm terminal fag.  I love C.  Ass nut.  Gay oral.  Try your C in this mouth.  It's an F-fest with bad junk.  Very nice.  Junk.  Man and bloke.  Oral ass penis.  Gag your balls out.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:10:30]  We want your penis.  The Epic U is the gay duo.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  How's that for a chopper?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, my God.  Steve was scared to even play it for me.  You've got to be kidding.  Steve goes, uh, are you in a good mood?  Because I want to play something for you.  Yeah, well, you have to understand, Jim's been working on these for about four months.  These are all the drops and stuff that... 
[00:11:00]  Is he going to get mad?  No.  No, no, this is...  I don't think he's mad.  I think he was just waiting to find out what you guys were going to say about him.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes.  But you're right.  I was a little apprehensive to play these for you this morning.  Well, that one didn't have an act.  No.  Well, there you go.  I'm putting it in perspective for you.  I'm going to help.  Great.  Nick.  Hey, when are you guys guesting on Will & Grace?  Easy.  Next week?  Thank you.  Keith, you're next on ADW.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, dude? 
[00:11:30]  I saw Ron and Fez Ron at noon.  All right, thank you.  No problem.  Any comments about the second one?  Anthony starring in Cabaret next week.  Anthony, do you want to take the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge?  Charles Nelson Ant.  Ant, you still haven't returned your copy of the First Wives Club.  Pitcher or Catcher.  Spit or Swallow.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on?  I want to know if Rowan A stands for oral and anal. 
[00:12:00]  That's funny.  See, we share, and this is what happens.  E from New York.  Not only does it suck, but it also blows.  Yes, it does.  You ready for the third one?  No.  Well, here it is.  O.P.M.S.  O.P.M.S.  The ambiguously gay to go.  Hey, Anthony, let's get naked.  No, never.  Take that shirt off there.  No.  Just go along with it. 
[00:12:30]  You are gay.  I hate Bush.  He loves junk.  I'm pulling out my junk.  Nice.  Now I'm ready for action.  You're obviously a stud.  Let's get naked.  O.P., could you take my pants off?  Yeah.  Naked?  He's just what I imagined him to be.  Yeah.  I'm going to ask like a nine-year-old boy.  Yeah, Anthony.  Screw me, O.P.  Okay.  Dick.  Ass.  Painful.  Dick.  Ass.  Painful.  I love junk.  I love ass.  Grown men jumping all over each other. 
[00:13:00]  I'm going to punch myself.  The M&G with the gay new road.  1027 WNEW.  That's a winner.  You see, okay, now that one.  Why am I taking it this day?  But you know what?  That had a character arc.  You were very coy in the beginning.  I was coy in the beginning.  You were a little coy in the beginning.  And then I opened up to things.  Yeah.  There's a whole little story going on there.  Is your car ready, Adam? 
[00:13:30]  Unbelievable.  I take it in that one.  You took it in two out of the three.  And the second one wasn't easy.  What's that?  Whatever, Ben?  Whatever, Ben?  You're giving us more drops, Ant.  Just keep talking.  Yeah.  I can't believe you're just going, but I'm taking it in that.  Like you prefer to be giving it?  No, no.  I prefer that they not even be made.  But if they are there, how come I've got to take it in two of them? 
[00:14:00]  And then in the second one, it's not like anyone's taking it.  It's just kind of a vague gay thing.  Opie doesn't take it at all.  No.  You're his best.  The first and third one.  Your complaint is Opie's selfish.  Yeah.  All right.  I get no payback.  Oh, brother.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to know when you're going to be on the next episode of Queer as Folk.  I want to make sure I see that one.  I like to, I want to know if Anthony takes a good old.  Hey.  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:30]  So there you have it.  That's awful.  I mean, I understand Jimmy worked on it a long time, which I find a little strange also.  He decides to go in that direction.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, I just want to welcome Anthony to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Oh, great.  And I'm going to head to plane throw down at the Glory Hole, and I want to divide him down for his first drink.  No problem.  All right.  We're getting killed on the phones now.  Tim, what's up?  Howdy.  Hey.  Faggots.  Chocolat starts in 30 minutes. 
[00:15:00]  Get chocolat.  Oh, man.  Fred, what's up?  Yeah, I finally learned on L&A that Anthony has no gag reflex.  That's good.  I'm really enjoying this segment.  My God.  Dave?  Yes?  Hey.  I heard Vaseline is the new sponsor of your guys' show.  Yeah.  Huh.  Congratulations.  Hey, Cindy.  Mike?  Hey. 
[00:15:30]  Hey.  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  Hey, I thought it was great.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, you guys have a great show.  I think you opened up your demographic.  Dave?  Shut up, Adam.  Amongst other things.  Your car is outside.  Dave.  Opened up.  I came to plug, but it has a double meaning now.  Yeah, see?  Hop on, Adam.  Dave, what's up?  Everyone else, dude?  Hey.  You guys should change your name to Neil and Bob.  Well, no.  Good job, bud, Jimmy.  Out of all the clips we've done on this show to put together... 
[00:16:00]  I would guess thousands of clips.  You decide to go in that direction.  I want to defend myself.  All my sound bites came from the Sally the F slut doll thing.  There's no one defending.  You're going to try, though.  Put together like that.  Oh, what do you think?  Everybody's thinking, wow, what show was that from?  They were, you know, banging each other.  They must have hung a mic in the office.  I missed that one.  Because all the clips were put together so smoothly. 
[00:16:30]  Joe, what's up?  What's going on?  I'm just going to tell you guys that the XFL has turned you guys from tight ends to wide receivers.  Ah, that old gag.  Thank you, Bob Nelson.  All right.  All right, let's take a break.  Great job.  You know, suddenly, Hospitaliano ain't so bad.  You know, when it's my turn in the barrel, I can handle it.  Hospitaliano.  Can you guys leave us alone?  We took our turn in the barrel. 
[00:17:00]  Doug?  Yeah, this is what happens when you watch too much Oz.  Oh, that must be it.  Rick Fox wants your number.  Rob?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up, man?  I want to know when Anthony's doing a duet with Eminem.  We're getting killed, eh?  Yeah.  Like you didn't expect it.  Let's play this.  Greg?  Yeah, I just want to know when you guys attend the next game.  What's in my mouth? 
[00:17:30]  Oh, no.  Wow.  All right.  That was good.  All right.  Thanks.  So, I guess the answer's no?  I guess the answer's no.  Oh, very funny, right?  The crying game.  That's good.  Jerry.  What's going on?  What's up, Jerry?  I wanted to know who got hit in the face with more balls, Yogi Berra or Anthony? 
[00:18:00]  Good one.  You got me.  Ass F.  Exactly what we expected, so I guess the answer would be no.  Is 30 Rock a gay bar?  People are so funny.  Savage.  Hey, Chris.  Aaron, are you going to be taping Match Game 2001 tonight?  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho.  How's that for a topper?  Oh, ho, ho. 
[00:18:30]  All right, let's move on, okay?  Good, good job.  All right.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony.  Saturday, 11 to 3.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  A bunch of ladies, you guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take a cheap bar to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Who makes a mitle? 
[00:19:00]  1027 WNEW.  The ONA Show, 212-757-1027.  Goddamn, he looks hammered.  All right, we're trying to get a mic on for you.  Hold on, Josh.  Oh, at least I didn't screw up the piano.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Looks like you just woke up.  I actually did.  I got back to the limo you guys sent me, and I feel like a king today.  You took a nap?  I did a little nappy-doo, and then I woke up with a Budweiser. 
[00:19:30]  Hey, that's the best way.  Let me tell you something, John.  Yes.  We have a lot of guests on this show, right?  Uh-huh.  We never send a limo.  Hey.  We absolutely love you.  Yeah.  Ask him, the limo guy.  We don't send limos for anyone.  Thank you very much.  I feel very special.  You know, can I start with an advertisement?  Sure.  Sure.  My poontang has a first name.  It's P-U-S-S-Y.  My poontang has an address. 
[00:20:00]  It's upstairs at the Y.  I love to eat it every day, and if you ask me why, I'll say,  cause tuna spread, it tastes okay, mixed up with my d**k DNA.  Yeah.  All right.  Someone's got to keep track of all the dumps.  This segment's going to be dumped out more than Otto and George.  Very nice, John. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  John, Valby, and us, we go way back, right, Anthony?  Yes, back to the Boston days.  We're a little nervous to have you in here,  cause Anthony and I have been in some sort of trouble the last three weeks, John.  You have.  And the last time we had you on one of our radio shows,  we were fired three weeks later.  I believe you were one of our last guests.  He was.  You said Mayor Menino was dead.  Right.  Up there in Boston.  Right.  That was April Fool's, right?  April Fool's, they didn't seem to think so.  Yeah, I know.  I don't understand why.  Yeah, they took it a little seriously.  I guess it was all the relatives they called in or something, you know? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, they, you know,  claimed that they didn't know if he was dead or alive.  Yeah.  Because ONA is your news station.  Your news station.  You know, they couldn't come over to WBZ and maybe get the real deal.  Yeah.  Go there for dick jokes.  The funny thing is,  John came back to Boston after we were fired and asked where we were.  Not here anymore.  Oh, they're no longer around, Mr. Val.  We know how that is.  I hear, Opie, we had ourselves fired.  That's right.  Up in Boston.  Yeah.  It's amazing the power we have.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Now, aren't the Long Island crowds amongst the sickest crowds you've ever played in front of?  Yeah.  You know, I'm playing at a comedy club tonight,  so, you know, it's a little more refined and everybody has a seat.  You know, I prefer like Toads in New Haven where everybody's standing up and it's a bunch of animals, you know?  Right, right.  But comedy clubs are good, too.  I mean, it's just a different atmosphere.  But, you know, it's Long Island, so they're a little nuts.  Yeah.  We've got a proposition for you.  Okay.  Anthony and I, we do these road shows.  Ah.  Where 2,500 people show up. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  You would be perfect.  Yeah.  For one of these road shows, maybe in the spring or something.  Yeah.  Let's do it.  We'll fly in, we'll get you the limo again.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  More Budweiser.  A couple of Hummers from some fat chicks or whatever.  Right.  I think we can arrange that.  Well, whatever it takes.  Sure.  Why not?  Who doesn't like the Hummer from the fat chicks?  You want to play us just a little number?  Ah, sure.  She's got the best tongue work that you've ever seen. 
[00:22:30]  She licks both my balls till they're shiny and clean.  And her pink little p***y is as tight as can be.  I know it's the cat, but it feels like a woman to me.  I better stop.  Wait, wait, wait.  John.  All right, John.  I know you've been drinking all day.  But it was the cat.  It was the cat.  You can't say pusky on the air?  You can say it when it's the cat. 
[00:23:00]  Sure.  It was the cat.  It was the cat.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, we found out late in the song.  Oh.  Wait, did they dump out of that?  Because maybe we could redo the song now that we know he's talking about a cat.  Let's, uh, let's, uh, Rick's running down the hall to see if, uh, we can get this song.  They're so touchy with their little regulations.  You know, I, I, I got, I got one that I think could get out of it.  It goes with the snow.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, Rick.  Are we finding out?  Rick?  All right.  Uh, people just heard the beginning of the kid's piano. 
[00:23:30]  That was about it.  But can he redo it now?  Can he redo it now that the dumb guy knows it's about a cat?  Okay.  This song is about a cat.  That's what he said.  It's about a cat.  You gotta help us out with the radio roll.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, right.  She's got the best tongue work that you've ever seen.  She licks both my balls till they're shiny and clean.  And her pink little pussies as tight as can be.  I know it's the cat, but it feels like a woman to me.  She rubs on my leg when she wants to get laid. 
[00:24:00]  I duct tape her eyes when I spray her with rain.  She keeps coming back, but that's all right by me.  My girl or my cat, it all tastes like puss-key to me.  I don't know if that made the air either.  Oh, sure.  You know, I can...  Don't say if that made the air, because now he's talking about balls and... 
[00:24:30]  That's okay.  He meant the little balls that the cat plays with.  What he meant.  We know what he meant.  They're fur balls.  We know what he meant.  Rick, what...  Not as subtle, I guess, as they were expecting.  Both machines, guys.  Have you ever watched that machine just count down?  Yeah.  Now picture, like, four of them just counting down like crazy from two to four to six.  All right.  So far, we haven't had any John Melody songs on the air.  Oh.  You know what, Phil?  We have it so that when it's taped, then we can put the appropriate police thing later. 
[00:25:00]  Right, right, right.  It's unbelievable.  How about the choir sings, I'm not listening, on her lips, I'm not listening, I'm at midnight  mass with my best piece of ass.  She's whacking on my with her hands.  Can you do that one?  Wait, wait, John.  John.  This is great.  Now, can I, can I, Boston, I played every one of these songs in Boston, and they didn't 
[00:25:30]  bleep anything.  There you go.  So, New York, catch up.  Exactly.  I think they might have dumped out of that one as well.  Let me try one thing about, you know, that stuff on her lip.  Okay.  Oh, you're not allowed to say that, huh?  No.  So I'm saying, these are some of the funniest piano intros I've ever heard.  You know, all of them are like that.  Oh, of course they are.  You know, you can use this one later for bleeping. 
[00:26:00]  This is such a good one.  It's really short.  Oops.  I did it again.  Oh, I can't say it.  I know I can't.  Oops.  I did it again.  I came in your mouth and shot on your chin.  Oh, Brittany, Brittany, oops.  I punctured your sh**, now you look like sh**, and you're not that talented.  Oh, God. 
[00:26:30]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Are we in Van Halen yet?  We might be in Van Halen.  You can't say that.  Oh.  All right, hold on.  We got to try to figure something out here.  Oh, God, is that funny?  It was a cute little song about Brittany Spears.  Oh, I got one.  I'll definitely make it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  This one will definitely make it.  This one will definitely make it.  If I'm wrong this time, shoot me.  Do we have enough done? 
[00:27:00]  We got some here.  Yeah, we got about 12 seconds.  Okay, here we go.  Off the road again.  My frickin' Ford flipped off the road again.  Half my family flew out comin' round the bend.  Thanks to Firestone, I'm off the road again.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, I got one on the air.  Yeah.  We got one on the air.  Oh, my God. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Oh, gee, it wasn't that bad.  You sang five songs so far, one day.  I think someone says, I heard a little bit of Ain't Talkin' About Love.  When we run out of dump, they have to turn this key, press a button,  and an old Van Halen song comes on instead of our show.  Oh, my God.  Can you believe how hung up they are?  Someone's saying, do the gangbang song.  I don't think so.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Gladiator.  Gladiator who?  Gladiator before the gangbang. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yes, he is.  Come on, Lona.  When she was younger, and in her prime, she used to gangbang all the time.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Judge Judy.  Judge Judy who?  Judge Judy, not by the size of her hooters, but by the number of wads on her robe.  That's a gangbang.  Yes, he will.  Well, the gangbang.  You didn't see the second bill.  You were younger, in her prime, she used to gangbang all the time. 
[00:28:30]  I'm not, knock.  Who's there?  Stevie Nicks.  Stevie Nicks who?  Stevie Nicks, my d*** with her b**** with her b**** with her teeth.  That's a gangbang.  Oh, my gangbang.  You can't say Richard?  What the hell is going on?  No, no.  Stevie Nicks.  No, Nick and your thing.  Oh, man, that's such a good one.  That one didn't make the air either. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  How about...  The people on hold are getting a good show.  Here's one I did in Boston.  How about knock, knock?  Who's there?  Eyeliner.  Eyeliner who?  Eyeliner bed with Charmin before I humper in the dumper.  And the gangbang.  It's the two of the gangbang.  Oh, yeah, you can do that one.  I can say that.  Can we get an update on the dump?  On the dump. 
[00:29:30]  On the dump.  I mean, dumper.  Come on, you can't say dumper?  You can say dumper.  We have seven seconds of delay left.  You can say dumper?  Seven seconds of delay.  Holy moly.  Oh, my God.  Did that make the air, Rick?  Yeah, that was a good one.  Yeah.  See, we're getting close now.  So you can say hump the dump?  Yeah, you can say that.  Hump the dumper, yeah.  A dumper could be a place, you know.  A dumper is where you put garbage.  It's the hotel up the street.  It's called the dumper.  So you go to Humper and the Dumper.  Sure, I like it. 
[00:30:00]  There's an excuse for everything.  You know, people are calling up now going,  I want to hear the songs on hold,  because if you get to on hold for our radio show,  you get to hear the unedited version.  Right, there you go.  For 12 people.  So you're entertaining 12 people right now.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, man.  I'm trying to control myself.  All right, we're just waiting for the delay to kick back in.  That's okay.  There are plenty of songs you could do, though.  I mean, he hasn't found one he could do.  No, we found like three so far. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I can definitely go back to some really old stuff.  You want to try something?  All right.  Sure.  Was it you that did the pushin'?  Left the stains upon the cushions,  Put prints on the dashboard upside down.  Was it you, you slywood pecker,  Who got into my daughter, Rebecca?  If it was you, you better leave this town.  Reply.  Yes, was I that did the pushin'? 
[00:31:00]  Left the stains upon the cushions,  Put prints on the dashboard upside down.  But since I got into your daughter,  I've had trouble passing water,  So I guess we're even all around.  We need someone to run back and forth  Between the dump guy to make sure  What's going on the air. 
[00:31:30]  I'm positive that was fine.  You think that one made the air, Anthony?  Sure.  You can say that.  You want to try some more?  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  Every time I lick your bun,  It gives me halitosis.  Every time you fart into my face,  It makes me nauseous.  Should I wear a rubber on my tongue,  Or am I overcautious?  I dated Allie McBeal one night,  She said I'd like to moon ya. 
[00:32:00]  She said her bony buttocks smell a lot like a petunia.  I said, alright, I'll take a whiff,  But that don't mean I'm doin' ya.  For that, I'd have to take more drugs  Than Robert Downey Jr.  Yeah!  Ah, well, you want to try one here?  A real risky one?  Super a-hole Albert Gore,  He finally conceded.  Gettin' rid of him and Clinton's  What this country needed.  Hillary wants to be the pres, 
[00:32:30]  But F that liberal bleeder.  George W. is the only Bush  That's gonna be our leader.  He's editing himself.  Look at this.  Let me try to edit this one here.  At the last word, you'll know what it is.  Okay.  Madonna had her wedding day,  A castle and a carriage.  I'll bet the frickin' ceremony's  Longer than the marriage.  The groom's more nervous  Than a honky Harlem train conductor.  He knows that he's the only guest 
[00:33:00]  That ain't already  I think they're on the right track.  God bless America.  John Valby, figure it out.  That's very good.  Holy ass.  A few people want to say hi to you, John.  Sure.

One of our faithful listeners  Gave us Zoloft last night  Gave us a big, like, starter package  Of Zoloft  This is a true story  Now, I don't know what Zoloft is  Patty  I take it to keep from killing y'all  Patty, I know you want to be close to the show and stuff  If you come down here right now and take some Zoloft  Opie, we cannot dispense prescription medicine on this show 
[00:42:30]  Uh, I don't take any kind of Zoloft  We want to give the Zoloft to someone to see what it does to a person  No, thank you  Would you be willing to come down and OD on Zoloft?  No  I don't think we could dispense narcotics  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all  No  Thank God for the Zoloft  So, you will not come down here and take some Zoloft?  No, I won't  Because that would hurt my body 
[00:43:00]  Well, your body's hurting  It's pretty hurting already  What do you mean by that?  Would you be able  Would you actually accept Opie as your first love?  Your first lover?  Your first F?  Now, you're talking nonsense, okay?  She didn't say no  No, no, I wouldn't  Why not?  Isn't he, don't you like his personality?  Oh, I love you both, I really do  Don't you  But not in that way  Wouldn't you like to have him take away that 
[00:43:30]  That blessed virginity of yours?  Haunt it out!  I would rather meet somebody who's unattached  And, you know, somebody that I care about very much, you know  Like in the future  Someday that will happen  In the future  Patty, you're 45, you've never made out with a guy  When are you, what are you waiting for?

No, no  Oh, I thought you meant my background  I come from a church background  And I've been sort of like, you know  In the 80s when I graduated college  I was at work a lot  And I kind of like isolated myself  I didn't get much of a social life, either  Ah, a church background  So you're into young boys?  No  Were you molested by a priest or a nun?  No  It's just that I was living among people

Because you know  Because you know  Where the urge  Is based around  You know what I mean?  Yeah, definitely  It's a physical urge  Right  Puzzah  So, what do you do  To take care of that?  Well, I just 
[00:55:00]  Again, I visualize  Like, maybe somebody  Like, uh  An actor  Or a singer  Or something  I know  And what are they  What are they doing  In these fantasies  That you have  Name an actor  That you have fantasized over  Okay, a musician  Uh, which one?  I've had a crush on The Edge  For, like, 15 years now  The Edge from you two  Yeah, I actually  Love the dance  I have a  You know  I've had a crush on him  For a long time  Because he's cute  Hey, well  We got The Edge right here  On the phone

The Edge just shot himself  Oh my God  Oh no  Mono just took himself out too  By association  Uh, Patty  Yes  Alright, so you're  On your mattress  I assume at this point  Yeah  Are you naked?  Be honest  Well  I guess  You know  Yeah  Yeah, baby  You know  Just like  You know  Like it's just  You know  It's just a fantasy 
[00:56:00]  This is real  And that's what makes it safe  Anuses  Anuses  You know  It's time  Butt check  Anuses  You're a filthy whore  You use your tongue  Perrier than a $20 whore  You know  But don't  You're  Hello  Yeah  Don't get me wrong  I don't have a dirty mind  Or anything  It looks like I'm a wreck  It's in the hose  So what do you  Uh  What do you think about? 
[00:56:30]  What do you imagine The Edge doing  That satisfies some of these fantasies?  Probably making love to you  And stuff  Oh wow  Making love to you  Yeah  So what type of  Like what's the move?  Do you see him at a concert?  He invites you backstage?  What's the fantasy about?  You know  You know  You meet him like a regular person  And a vision going out with him 
[00:57:00]  And whatever  You know  But that's only a chance to see  It'll never happen  You've never seen a grown man naked?  Does The Edge take you out for some ice cream?  Well no  More like Dinner and Roses  It's more like it  All right  Anthony  Through the magic of radio  Yeah  We have entered  Stalker Patty's  Fantasy Month  Right  And I do believe we have audio of The Edge  All right  Thanks for having me  Oh my God 
[00:57:30]  All right  So now you're with The Edge  Yeah  He's making love to you  Is it on your bed?  A familiar surroundings?  Is it a plastic cell?  Actually  I tend to take myself back  A familiar surroundings  And put myself in a hotel  I'm in a nuclear area  All right  So you're in a hotel  With The Edge  And then obviously  You're not just all of a sudden  Naked and making love  With The Edge  From you too  There's got to be  Some kind of a set up  So you're in the hotel  What happens? 
[00:58:00]  Because you don't drink or anything  You're talking  Does he start rubbing you?  How does this  Hey everybody  We're all going to get late  How does this pan out?  Well  It  Pans  What?

How does the sexual part  Of this start up? 
[00:58:30]  Well  I would let him  Take the wave  Yeah  So  Oh and Anthony  With that  I do believe  We have more audio  From The Edge  All right  You're a little bitch  That's right  You're a bitch  And I bet you'd like  To suck it  Wouldn't you?  Wow  You know  Plus you know  I read magazines  Like Cosmopolitan  Cosmopolitan  You know  I get a little  Excited to that  You know  I'm not into  The romance  Type stories  But I like reading  About real life  Situations 
[00:59:00]  Uh huh  You know  And I imagine  Some of those  Situations  That I read about  Anthony  Yeah  More audio  From The Edge  You look like  Two miles  Of man roads  Is it true  That um  They wrote  Sunday Bloody Sunday  About you  No  That was about  A political situation  In Ireland  In 1971  I thought it was  A few days  Before your urges  Oh stop  Okay  Well you know  It's my mistake  I'm sorry  Yeah  So now  He makes the first move 
[00:59:30]  What does he do  To make this first  Sexual move  Toward you?  I don't know  Essentially  We just go right  Into the bed  That's all  Into the bed  Now you're rubbing  Each other  And touching  And he's touching  The uh  Does he start now  Touching your  Naughty parts?  Well not right away  You know  No I know  I know  But we're up to that  And you are  One pathetic loser  So now  Yeah 
[01:00:00]  Now you're naked  You're in bed  With The Edge  Yeah  And you're rubbing  Each other  And you're rubbing  Each other's  Little naughty parts  Well  Yeah  So now  Since you've never  Had sex before  How do you imagine  The act of having sex?  Very gentle and sweet  But I mean  How do you even know  What would be done  If you've never  Had sex before?  I don't  Have you seen it  In maybe some  Pornographic movies  Patty? 
[01:00:30]  Actually  Once in a while  I've watched them  Just out of curiosity  Oh so you've seen  So you've seen the act  So you know  What it would look like  Yeah well  I just  In the pain of my mind  For the most things  So what is it  What is your fantasy  And your urges  And your body  Feel like  When The Edge  Plants one?  How does The Edge  Take you Patty?  Yeah  Does he take you  From behind?  Do you ride him?  Something tells me  You're a missionary  You got that right  Ah  Patty on the bottom  Yeah  The Edge on top 
[01:01:00]  Pulling that wool cap  Over his own face  Because I'm going to tell you  Some of the positions  That I see pictured  In Cosmopolitan magazine  I really don't think  I could get him  Yeah well  Patty  No doubt  There are some wild positions  In Cosmopolitan  Cosmopolitan  I don't understand  How she bends over  With that sweater on  Patty  Do you read those articles  How to satisfy your man?  No I've seen some  Of the weirdest things  With legs up on the table  Oh yeah 
[01:01:30]  That's a weird one  That's pretty wanky  Yeah that sucks  When that happens  So alright  You're doing it  With The Edge  In your fantasy  Missionary position  Missionary position  And it's very nice  And soft and sweet  Now just the image  In your head  And the fantasy  Can't be enough  To satisfy you  Your hands  Now start to roam  A little bit  Right?  Right  Well  It's perfectly normal  That people  People touch themselves  They get  Yeah they get into that  It goes hand in hand

[01:25:30]  You love to get the  You used to have to just  Sit there after the show  And sell tapes  To get it out  Now punch it right out  Working good  You've got a lot of CDs out too  Oh yeah  I think I have about 20 of them  Wow  Is that possible?

Sure  Let's try  Here's a mild one  I know this one will work  Torn between two lovers  My wife and my own left hand 
[01:26:00]  Believe me on my wedding night  This is not what I had planned  Torn between two lovers  But if I had to choose  The sad truth is  My effing wife would lose  Yeah  Yeah  You know I heard your little theme song thing there  The zip zip thing  I got one  I want to  Opie and Anthony on the radio 
[01:26:30]  They're going to make you laugh  With the crazy show  But what I saw today  Made my junk go out  Opie doing Anthony on the lesbian couch  O-N-A  Hey  The king and queen of New York  Wait a minute  Come on  Wait a minute  Where was this set up?  What the hell?  No offense 
[01:27:00]  No offense  Hey well who was doing who though?  Very funny  I've heard about  I just heard rumors of this lesbian couch  No it's amazing  What the hell happens there?  We usually have girls come in  Yeah  We pull the lesbian couch  Which is also the waiting room couch  That you're probably sitting on  We bring it in  And the girls get on the couch  And have their first lesbian experience with each other  On this couch 
[01:27:30]  Wow  We put on some nice music  Dim the lights  Nothing  And just whack  You put this out on the webcast and everything?  Oh yeah  It goes out on the web  Wow  People can spank it right at home  Right along at home  And you were just sitting on that couch  So I would get that white suit  Drive plane very soon  That's ladies  You know  Who cares?  We don't allow guys on the lesbian couch  For just that reason  People have to sit on the god damn thing  You can tell people there were a couple of girls  Munching on it  But you can't say  You can't tell a guy that the couch he's sitting on 
[01:28:00]  Has been spooked upon  You know  We should put the word out  A couple ladies in the neighborhood  Please come down  Yeah  Show John something  You know  We got some favorites here  That are friends of the show  Readily available  That could come in  The regulars  Right  Come on in  Show John a little something  Ready John?  Got another one?  Eddie hit the john to drain out a snake  He finished p***ing and he gave it a shake  He left the bathroom having made one mistake 
[01:28:30]  His zipper was wide open  He left his fly wide open  We had a bird's eye view  Out of his pants was poking  Junk without a clue  Her name was Lisa  She was dressed like a slut  She had a g-string in the crack of her butt 
[01:29:00]  She hiked her dress up to the folds of her gut  Her legs were wide open  She had her legs wide open  At first we thought it was rude  But having her legs wide open  Kept the flies off of the food  Kept the flies off of the food 
[01:29:30]  Yeah  I don't know  I don't know  Frickin' John Valby  Frickin' John Valby  David, what's going on?  Man, does this bring back memories  I remember John Valby playing at Rum Bottoms in Massapequa  Rum Bottoms  I thought he was dead  You thought I was dead?  Get over here, I'll knock you out  You must be a giant fan  Man, this is great  You guys ruled 
[01:30:00]  Alright, a lot of giant fans are listening  Yeah  You know, I have the first half of something I can do  Oh, my name is  Oh, my name is Jim Fossil  And my guarantee has come to pass  The Giants are in the playoffs  And the media can kiss my ass  I can't do the rest until tonight  Because there's no effing way  What a cheese  That's good  You're the governors tonight  You hear the rest of that one  There's no way you can clean it up 
[01:30:30]  Ah, no  It takes the punch out of me  Yeah  Alright, alright  I'm just asking, okay  By the way  Are you thinking the Giants are going to go all the way?  I'm a Jets fan  You're a Jets fan?  Nice  Go Finney  I don't know  I don't know  A lot of the teams that I thought were going to do real good  Like Tampa Bay  Lost  I mean, they lost  Billy  You think he can handle Billy the third time?  I will say  No problem  I don't know  Donovan's dad's coming on pretty good  No problem  You are a big football fan, aren't you? 
[01:31:00]  I'm a super football fan  Your team?  I live in Buffalo  But since I was a little kid  I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan  Oh, Dallas  So most New Yorkers hate me for that  You know, being a Dallas Cowboys fan  Could be the most offensive thing you've said here  To a lot of the listeners  That's why I went to great pains to explain the genesis of this  That's great  They could play with fresh cuff marks on their wrist  Which is good  You've got to give them that  Ah, very good  Look at everyone  God, I loved this guy 
[01:31:30]  Until he said he was a Cowboys fan  Yeah, you better redeem yourself now, John  Anything else we can maybe touch on without dumping?  Well, let me see  I wish I had a pedal for this one  Yeah  Boy, the way the Beatles played 
[01:32:00]  Smokin' pot and gettin' laid  Guys with long hair had it made  Those were the days  My junk exploded like a bomb  When she rubbed it on her palm  Gee, I had the greatest mom  Those were the days  Always alcohol impaired 
[01:32:30]  Men were men and sheep were scared  Mister, we could use a slut like Linda Lovelace again  You always got the second base  Cause women knew their effin' place  In the kitchen or on my face  Those were the days 
[01:33:00]  Now usually I try to make up to the girls for that song with  Well, it isn't long and it isn't thick  It gets hard too slow and it comes too quick  It gets lost in a slot but it's all that I've got  It's a small, small junk don't rhyme with it  I think we know where that went  Someone's asking to hear the syphilis song 
[01:33:30]  I don't know if we can get that on the end  Leprosy  All my skin is falling off of me  I'm not half the man I used to be  Oh, how did I get leprosy  Syphilis  It just started with a simple kiss  Now it even hurts to take a piss  That's enough, I can't do no more 
[01:34:00]  Oh, that's an oldie moldie  I think we've jumped out of that too  Well, you want to do a couple of hay laddies and get out of here?  You got to get out of here?  Well, I don't have to  I don't know what to do  I thought we would hang and stuff  You got to wait for the girls to get here anyway  Oh, yeah, oh, absolutely  Oh, I thought you were just giving me a hint there  Oh, all right  Do you think we have anything else planned today?  No, I don't know  Come to me  Your face looks like 
[01:34:30]  F***ing to me  Wait a minute  I don't know, it should have  I mean, if you can say the first come  You can say the second come  I think the beer's kicking in  I got another one that might make it  All right  Yeah, we're trying to get some of these on the air  Sure  I love this whole time 
[01:35:00]  Holy  She's sweet  I like the big fat bitch in heat  She's roly poly  Stuffed cannoli from fat F street  She cracks concrete  When she waddles down the street  You know, I swear when she backs up  You hear beep  That guy, yeah, yeah, yeah 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah  I think that might have made it  Puff the magic town  This song really pisses girls off  Just so you know  Puff the magic town  Live between her knees  And frolic in that awful mist  In the land of yeast and cheese  Puff the magic town  When he first took the plunge 
[01:36:00]  Made a splash inside her gash  Swelled up like a sponge  Little Jackie's junker  He loved that rascal pup  He humped those little head  Got red  He couldn't get enough  Then one night it happened  Puffy sprang a leak  But don't complain 
[01:36:30]  You sleazy bitch  He's been in your box a week  Puff the magic town  With the clean her knees  And frolic in that awful mist  In the land of yeast and cheese  Puff the magic town  Was thrown in a garbage can  And got recycled  As fiber in  Kellogg's Raisin Bran  Yeah 
[01:37:00]  Alright, someone check to see  If that made the radio  I said I  That was fine  You think that was fine?

[01:41:30]  Pardon me  That was only  Five days ago  To do whatever I feel  A big kiss  Wah  Hello  To New York City  New York  You're listening to  The Gay Marco Show  Here on  1027  WNEW  15 minutes  What a thrill 
[01:42:00]  This is for me  I'm so excited  I'm dripping  And I promise  I won't stay  In the seat here  But I mean  Who would have thought  Little gay Marco 
[01:42:30]  Santangelo  From Geneseo  New York  Who would one day  Be here  I mean I used to play  With my sister's Barbies  Wear my mother's high heels  And then here I am  In this fabulous city  On this legendary  Radio station  WNEW  Extolling the joys  Of man to man  Sphincter stretching  And bodily fluid swapping  But for those of you  Who are not familiar  With the ONA show  I'm a occasional guest  On the program  And I write a weekly column  For FoundingMusic.com  I hate to do this 
[01:43:00]  Because I don't like  Breaking into the show  But we do have  One of Marconi's relatives  One of his ancestors  Marconi the inventor  Radio on the phone  Go ahead  Sorry  Go ahead Mark  Thank you  So I'm really enjoying  The chance to be able  To write for FoundingMusic  It's been a real pleasure  And like I said last week  I feel like I'm Opie and Anthony's  Very own personal version  Of Sarah Jessica Parker  From Sex and the City  Every week  You know I sit in my bed 
[01:43:30]  With my little laptop  Wearing my crop top  Nincing t-shirt  And my shorty shorts  Writing my column  So last week  I wrote a column  Pitching my idea  For my own radio show  And so here I am  So I'm going to  Try to incorporate  No  I'm going to try to incorporate  Some of the ideas  From my column  Into today's show  As well as  Some other fun  And exciting little things  As well  Okay  I'm big dick black 
[01:44:00]  Well squeeze it  Well one thing  I did want to include  Was a co-host  But as you see  I'm going solo today  And those of you  Who read my column  Know my dream co-host  Was Froy  From Opie and Anthony 
[01:44:30]  Message Board  Anyways  We met here in the studio  About six  We met here in the studio  About six weeks ago  And it was love  At first sight  For me  He is so hot  And he's very young  But he's really hot  I don't know how young  He is  And I'm not quite sure  What constitutes statutory rape  In New Jersey  But he's still very hot  And he's straight 
[01:45:00]  He's very straight  But he's hot  And all you single girls  In New Jersey  You know  Look him up  Because he's single  And he's sexy  And he's funny  And he's hung  Did I say that?  Oh no  Excuse me  I am  So I contacted Froy  Asking him  If he would be my co-host  And he said  Unfortunately  He had to babysit  After school  So you know  This made me realize  I know why  I don't date  Younger guys anymore  Because they're always  Too busy  With either their homework  Or band practice  Or detention  So now I only date guys 
[01:45:30]  So now I only date guys  Over 19  So  I decided to  Go to the message board  Because you know  There's a lot of great talent  On there  And maybe I could find  Another co-host  And first I thought  I really like Fez  Not Fez from Ron and Fez  But Fez from the message board  And he's really very talented  And he also writes a column  Got milk  He writes the second best column  On foundrymusic.com  And so I send him 
[01:46:00]  An email  Excuse me  So I wrote Fez  And sight unseen  I have no idea  What it looks like  So I didn't know  What kind of chemistry  We would have  I still wrote him anyway  But he was busy too 
[01:46:30]  So  I kept searching  Through the message board  And finally I came to  Corpse grinder junk  Now I thought  This was very interesting  Because  Hey  He has junk in his name  And I like it in my mouth  So  I thought maybe  We'd have something in common  I'm just a flaming Fez  But you know  His pictures  That he posted  Are just really frightening  I mean  They really  Really scare me  So I passed on him  And I figured  I could go at it alone  And give it my best shot 
[01:47:00]  So here I am  Today  And speaking of  Giving it my best shot  I have to say  I love  Porn  I love porn videos  But  There's only two things  I like about it  I like the money shot  And I like the dialogue  That leads up to  You know  The sex part  So you know  You always have to  Fast forward  To get to the dialogue  But this past Christmas  I got a DVD player  From one of my  Holiday boyfriends  You know  Holiday boyfriends  Are those boyfriends  You just keep long enough  Through the holidays  To get lots of presents from  And then you dump them  Afterwards  You know 
[01:47:30]  You dump them  Actually before New Year's  You tell them like  You need to get in touch  With yourself  And you need your space  And sometimes  You're going to have  Three or four of these  Because you get more presents  But  So I have this  Really cool DVD player now  And last week  I got my first  Gay porn DVD  Saving Ryan's private  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off 
[01:48:00]  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  Turn it off  So I was so excited  I finally  Had a gay DVD  And I could cut  Right to the dialogue parts  And right to the money shots  But you know  It doesn't work that way 
[01:48:30]  They only go right  To the sex parts  You still have to  Fast forward  To get to the dialogue  I just don't understand it  But you know  You really got to love  These flimsy movie plots  When you're telling  These little stories  Here's a good idea  Have a point  It makes it so much  More interesting  For the listeners  Hey  Hey  Saving private  Saving Ryan's private  Is a story  Of a boy from Iowa  Who joins the service  And gets it in the mouth  And in the  And everywhere else  End of story  So um 
[01:49:00]  Now this  You know  This movie is a big  Comeback for Ryan Idol  He was a big porn star  Like years ago  And one night  He did too many drugs  And fell out a window  Or something  And obviously  He wasn't taking  Acting lessons  While he was recovering  But now  For your enjoyment  I would like to reenact  A critical scene  Can we see your stuff?  From Saving Ryan's Privates  You got me  Scene two  Into the office  Of the commanding officer  Walks Private Ryan  Private Ryan Idol

[01:59:30]  I think your show should be regular  Thank you Angela  Love you  No problem  Bye  Bye bye  Speaking of Jay Moore  And some fun  You know it's hard to believe  It was a little over a year ago  I was in this very studio  And Jay Moore was spanking me  And drawing a bullseye on my ass  Many of you don't realize  Our breakup occurred  A few months after that  Yes  While he was on the set  Of that Kevin Spacey film  Jay called me one night  And said that something  Had come between us  And I'm just wondering  If it was someone 
[02:00:00]  Who was on that movie set  But I have to say  That that person did me a favor  And today  Jay C  Is my only true love  Yes  This is the  Gay Marco show  On 102.7 WNEW  And actually  I wrote a little column  This week about Valentine's Day  So be sure to check that out  On Foundry Music  But I personally decided  To remain single  This Valentine's Day  You know swimsuit season's coming  I didn't need any  That could die of the chocolate  And I spent the day  With my friend Steve  And we went down  To the meatpacking district  And had dinner  At Pestis 
[02:00:30]  And we sucked down  Some muscles  And you know  The kind that come in a shell  And I had a few Cosmos  And I would decide  To stroll around town  You know down there  And you know  I didn't realize this  But that's where  All the transvestite hookers are  And I mean  I guess they don't call it  The meatpacking district  For nothing  So anyways  There's this really big  Fag  There's this big fat  Nasty hooker  And she like  Looks at us  And she goes  What are you two  Fags looking at 
[02:01:00]  And I'm like  Well we're not looking at you  You nasty old drag hag  And so then  We went running down the street  Like two little school girls  So this morning  I'm lying in bed  Thinking about this  And I'm like  I can't believe  She called us fags  I mean that's like  The least offensive name  To be called  And are there really  Any names out there  That would truly offend me  And suddenly  It hit me on the right cheek  I still can't believe  I can shoot that far  But so I was cleaning up  While I was cleaning up 
[02:01:30]  I had this brilliant idea  For a new game  The most offensive name game  So call me at  212-757-1027  I want your most offensive names  Besides fags  Alright  I want to hear some  Really offensive names  So if you really  Really offend me  I'll send you  One of my autographed pictures  Of me and Jay Moore  Having sex  And now let me tell you something  Before I explain this  There are some names  That just don't offend me  Okay  For example  Bone smuggler  Alright

[02:09:00]  Well over here  You were talking about Nixon or something  Or George W  Constant search for news  That's what I am  That's the news now  You know Bush  President-elect Bush  He's trying to get his peeps in place  You know  Much like the management here  At any  And he's picked for defense secretary  Donald Rumsfeld  All right  You might not know who this guy is  But he used to work with Richard Nixon  Many many years ago 
[02:09:30]  And they found some tapes  Of him talking with Dick Nixon  And some of the conversations  Wow  A little abrasive  Where the blacks are concerned  Back then  Very turbulent time  Opie  And  Who was it  Agnew  Spiro Agnew  Nixon's vice president  Went to Africa  And while he was in Africa  He started saying stuff like  The blacks in Africa  Are much smarter 
[02:10:00]  And much  Much nicer  Than the blacks that we have  Over in America  That would be pretty much  A career ending statement  Sure  But he went on for a little longer  Until the tax evasion stuff got him  But Nixon then commented  On some of Agnew's comments  And as he did  This guy Donald Rumsfeld  Was in the room  With Nixon  And of course  Nixon had all of his tapes going  Nixon loved to tape record everything 
[02:10:30]  So as he's talking  So there's tapes  Of Nixon saying  Oh yeah  Stuff you're about to say  Oh yeah  Yeah  He was talking  And this Rumsfeld guy  Just kept saying stuff like  Yeah  Uh huh  Like he didn't want to elaborate  On anything  But he was saying  Yeah  Yep  Uh huh  Yeah  After all these Nixon comments  Now a couple of things  Um  He said  Newspaper cited  That it said  Agnew's unflattering comparisons  Between African  And American blacks  Um 
[02:11:00]  Saying that  African blacks were smarter  Too he said  Uh Nixon said  Uh that doesn't help  It hurts us with the blacks  He was always trying  To get a relationship  With black people  And young people  Nixon  So uh  He said  It doesn't help with the blacks  It doesn't help with the rednecks either  Cause the rednecks  Don't think any negroes are good  Oh  So he's coming  And that's when Rumsfeld said  Uh yes  He just said yes  So is he in trouble for like  They're trying to get 
[02:11:30]  And spin something out of it  They're trying to you know  Get something out of this  But to be quite frank with you  I think Nixon's right there  I don't think the rednecks  Like any uh black people  Um  As for the notion that  Black Americans  Aren't as good  As black Africans  Uh Nixon said  Most of them are basically  Just out of the trees  Nixon said that  Oh my god  Nixon said that  That's right  Most of them are  Just out of the trees 
[02:12:00]  Get the F out  Oh  And then he said something like  Well by god  Even the southerners say  Well our niggers is  And then it says  Unintelligible  I'd love to know  A tricky dick said there  About our niggers  Shock damn Nixon  Oh  And um  Then he said 
[02:12:30]  Hell  That's the way they talk  After the unintelligible part  And Rumsfeld said  So maybe he was doing  Some of that gibberish  Maybe  And Rumsfeld to that  Said that's right  And then uh  Nixon said something like  I can hear them  I didn't even know  What he was talking about  Then Rumsfeld said  I know  And then uh  Nixon says  Continues  It's like when our  Black athletes  Uh at the olympics  Are running against  Other black athletes  The southerners  May not like the black  But he's for that  Black athlete 
[02:13:00]  And then uh  Rumsfeld says  That's right  Right  Nixon says  That's for sure  Rumsfeld said  Well enough of that  That's what he said  So  This Rumsfeld guy  Now is getting in  A little bit of trouble  For just saying  That's right  I know  That's for sure  Chris has some more  Info on this  Hey Chris  What's going on  Hey what's going on guys  Hey man  Well he was right  What he said  You know  Like hell  I mean  One minute  They swing it from trees  Next minute  They drive it behind

You know when you get clawed by a cat?  It's all over her belly, all over her legs.  That's what I was saying when I saw her laying it.  They're like just fine scratches all over her body.  Bravo.  How was that, Jackie?  Very nice.  Very nice?  I don't know what else to say.  That was just amazing.  Anthony, what do you think?  That was nice.  But where's the guy that brings her sunglasses?

I love you, but you dick.  What did you do? 
[02:32:30]  It was a perfect ending.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We might have an encore before we get out of here, okay?  Yeah.  I don't know if her body can handle it, though.  This is like scratches everywhere.  Hey, do you ever see the movie Seven?  Yes.  What about that contraption that guy was wearing for Lust?  Oh, yeah.  That was some pretty cool stuff.  You like that?  The big knife on the strap-on thing, and you just ripped the girl in two?  I wouldn't like dying.  No?  No.  I'd prefer to stay alive.  You think you're not going to like the finale of this show? 
[02:33:00]  All right.  Wow.  Everybody loved that, except Big Cat was a little disappointed.  Big Cat said it was sort of like watching a movie and then walking out on the end, because  he's used to maybe plunging the knife into a chest or something.  Right there, Kev?  Yeah.  That's right.  It was a lot neater than unusual.  Yeah.  See?  Should we do like a quick encore?  Yeah.  Quick encore.  What do you guys think?  Quick curtain call.  Have a little left in here or what? 
[02:33:30]  Absolutely.  No problem.  All right.  Are you going to let Shannon do a topless?  I do a little bit.  Ah, yeah.  She knows how to handle the knife.  I'm just going to let her know.  She knows how to handle the knife.  All right.  All right.  Ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  I'll do a topless, okay?  I suggest gloves and a black hat.  Did I move to the couch?  Yeah.  And then give everything to Robert Cargassian.  And then take a plane to Chicago.  That's an OJ, man.  I think Jackie the Knife Girl and Robert Reddy and Hot Wax Shannon topless. 
[02:34:00]  Can she get in a little better position so when she leans over the camera isn't?  No, not you.  Oh, not you.  No, the one with the fine-looking chest.  All right.  Wow.  Now she's got two knives working her body, Anthony.  Yes.  Make a move.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.

[02:41:00]  oh my god  that wasn't me  though  that was Frank  Calliando  no no  I saw you  I've heard  Calliando  but no  that was  oh my god  you were so funny  last night  I appreciate it  made my birthday  thanks  happy birthday  I'm telling you guys  we're going tonight  yeah we say it  every time  Brian's in town  he's got to be good  because we are  really really tired  and spent  after last night  but we are going  tonight  still going  I know  still going  look at that  Rick was saying  you guys had  like a midget  a midget kiss group  or something  yeah  that's a politically 
[02:41:30]  correct  well they don't like  being called midgets  they want to be called  dwarves  dwarves  alright  is that true  yeah  and they were all  in the kids  makeup  dwarves  I don't know  dwarves  kiss dwarves  kiss dwarves  little dwarves  little people  that's cool man  yeah they came out  with all the makeup on  and they were the lip sync  they didn't really play  oh  you know  that would have been  my god  if they played  imagine that  but it's hilarious  they walk on stage  with their little bodies  all dressed in the 
[02:42:00]  kiss makeup  yeah  it was a freak show  last night  I'm sitting here  feeling bad  I said midget before  I didn't realize  it was politically  incorrect  look at you  I'm trying to say  a good thing  about the kiss group  and I come right off  with the wrong terms  how do you know  and then look like midget  midget would seem okay  dwarf doesn't seem okay  dwarf's like a cartoon thing  everything gets switched  everything you say  for a while  then you can't say it anymore  yeah  but I'm always the last  to find out  and you always say  the wrong thing  yes  exactly  dwarf  colored oriental 
[02:42:30]  midgets  you can't say that  remember when oriental  was fine  for a long time  for a damn long time  you can't say that anymore  oriental is  that is an object  can be oriental  we are Asian  what  what the hell  did that happen  it's an oriental  rug  rug  right  but an Asian person  standing on the oriental rug  right  got it  Kevin's going to help  Brian Regan  with the midget dwarf thing 
[02:43:00]  ah good  Kevin  yeah how you doing guys  hey Kevin  good how's it going Brian  good  there's a technical difference  a midget  is someone under  four feet tall  who's perfectly proportioned  they have a regular sized head  regular sized arms  for little bodies  a dwarf  is that little tiny body  with the big head  so basically  doctors differentiate  between the two  got it now  ah  so if these little  kids guys  had those  you know  those big heads  and those funny little legs  then they're dwarves  they're not midgets  they each got their own  different associations 
[02:43:30]  there's midgets of America  there's dwarves of America  so  now the midgets  they don't like being confused  got it  and the midgets  don't get along with the dwarves  apparently not  now the dwarves  get all the attention  you know  but everybody  I mean  you make fun of the dwarves  more but  but  the midgets  you know  they don't get enough  recognition  there's this whole little war  going on  that we don't even know about  you imagine they  you know  both groups book a convention  in the same hotel  and like  they don't know about  the other group  and then  oh no  there's bad blood  in the lobby man  the midgets  and the dwarves  when you're a dwarf 
[02:44:00]  you're a dwarf  all the way  who do you call me a dwarf  I'm a midget  do I look like  I'm in proportion  yeah  do I look like  my arms and legs  are proportional  to the rest of my body  who are you calling  a midget here  oh boy  let's go to Brooks  another girl showed up 
[02:44:30]  to get her pictures done  for the best ass contest  last day that the girls  could come down  oh there's a new girl  yes Brooks what's up  hey what's up ONA  hey  how's it going  hey Brian  when's your next CD  coming out buddy  don't know  I don't have any  short term plans  I'm like lame  at planning my career out  everybody else has  all kinds of goals  and aspirations  I'm like hey  I never even thought  about that  maybe I should do  another one  you just go  do your gigs  do the shows  and fly home 
[02:45:00]  hey you ever thought  about getting on TV  you know  I see these other guys  do it  they seem to be  making a lot of money  I gotta go out  and do something like that  no you're right  man I appreciate  hopefully you'd  want to check it out  so  you gotta write  one of those  wacky comedy books  too Brian  that's right  because we all  download it  I mean bought  the first CD  so we're back  to the second one  Brian was that  ass better than  the one you saw  the last time  you were in the studio  oh man  every time I come  in here 
[02:45:30]  it's a blast  in fact it was  like a little weird  when I came in today  because last time  we were in the studio  there was like  a naked guy  in a swimming pool  that was Ron and Fez  seeing the rat eaters  here  they had  the hemorrhoid touch  hemorrhoid yeah  that was  when we finally  got these sounds  those sounds  Brian was here  watching the guy  administer the  preparation H  I'm a completely  different person  since I started  coming in here  you really are  alright Brooke  thank you  thanks guys  later  well Karen is  the mother 
[02:46:00]  of a dwarf  oh no  ah  well let's give her  some equal time  here Karen  yes  how are you  okay  you know  there's an  organization  called  Little People's  America  oh  yeah  and the  politically  correct term  is little  person  little person  for a dwarf  or a midget  no it's neither  you know  it goes back  in the days  when you're  referring to  but Karen  Karen  I gotta stop you  we had  kiss dwarfs  last night  they wanted  to be called  dwarfs  not midgets  well actually  they were called  mini kiss  weren't they 
[02:46:30]  oh  no kiss dwarfs  yeah they wanted  to be called  kiss dwarfs  so you're saying  that neither term  is correct  no what it is  is actually  because being part  of Little People  of America  it was founded  by Billy Barty  who recently died  he was a dwarf  he had a different  he had cartilage  hair syndrome  what's that  well there's like  4,000 different  kinds of dwarfism  well I'm not going  to memorize the name  for every one of them  well neither am I  some of the people 
[02:47:00]  you know some of them  the most popular form  is what you guys  usually see  is a chondroplasia  you're a mother  of a dwarf  child with dwarfism  dwarfism  don't use it as a noun  when did you find  that out  when did I find  that out  you usually find  it out  either at birth  or a few months  after  how was it  with you  a few months  after  well the pregnancy  must have been  easy  well sometimes  they get diagnosed  later  you know there's  doctors in  university hospitals  I mean your example  you gave birth 
[02:47:30]  and then did you  know right away  or did you  yeah they find out  during the pregnancy  even before the  child was born  oh how long  during your pregnancy  did you find out  they could find out  within like  you know six months  when they're doing  the sonograms  oh and they did  and all of a sudden  they said hey  you know it's like this  you're going to have  a little person  or a child with dwarfism  and you know  it's not as big  as a deal  as people make it  sound out  there's people  did they give you  the choice  pardon me  did they ask you  if you wanted to  you know 
[02:48:00]  be given the choice  you know  you had those options  with any kind of  any mother has that choice  no matter what it is  you know  the choice  the big A  but you never do it  no  if you guys  visited these people  that did many kids  last night  some of them  have families  oh no I know  no no I'm saying  they're great kids  they have kids with  we were loving  kiss dwarfs last night  they were great  and you know  people with dwarfism  because I'm not  going to use it  as a noun  do you know 
[02:48:30]  they can have  normal sized children  yes they can  and that's got to  be a trip huh  all of a sudden  you're towering over  mom and dad  that happens all the  time  how old is your  is it a boy or  girl  girl  and how old is she  six years old  yeah okay  six  wow  how about that  all right Karen  thank you  thank you  see when it's extreme 
[02:49:00]  it's funny  yeah is my  the thing grown  inside me  is it going to  have blonde hair 
[02:49:30]  no  all right I'm done  take it away  take it out  I've had my fill  enough  that's enough  and someone told me  to ask you about  kids books  oh well you know  I've got a boy  myself  he's two years  old and I've been  reading to him  you know  and is he a dwarf  or a midget  he's a person  with height  with height  okay  not that that's  any better than  anybody else  what he is  look at Ryan  he's squareman man 
[02:50:00]  you stay right  on that line man  everyone loves me  I want to continue  that happy feeling  it's like every time  I say something  I gotta like go back  what did I just say  now you know  both shows tonight  it's just gonna be  an hour of corrections  and apologies  right when I first  came in and talked  about stalker Patty  first of all  that was unkind  towards her  so I apologize  about that  then I said  midget  followed up with dwarves  both of them  are politically incorrect  I apologize again 
[02:50:30]  I've got no time  for any jokes  goodnight  and I apologize  that I can't  do my jokes  and I'm so sorry  now I've been reading  to little Christopher  and you know  these books  I don't know  who's writing  children's books  I just want  a piece of the pie  the financial pie  to these big  cardboard clunky books  you know  and I have them  on my lap  and it's like  the clock  and you turn 
[02:51:00]  this big chunky page  the big clock  you turn another page  tick tock  you turn another page  the end  and you look  in the back  twelve bucks  I mean what  are these guys  mingling with other authors  hey I read  I read your book  the clock  that is a real  page turner  you know  I was halfway  into war and peace  and then somebody  told me about this  the clock book  I had to 
[02:51:30]  pick that one up  and give it a read  you guys do books  on tape  my wife got me  books on tape  every once in a while  because I can't read  fast at all  if you got one of those  road trips  it makes the time  go by  sure  and I did it  so I could like  read faster  you know  or whatever  get through a book  faster  but the whole point  was so I could  fit in better  at parties  so I would have  a little bit  of knowledge  which I lack  completely now  but when you do  books on tape  you still get  that cool  at a party  people talking  about a book  yeah that book 
[02:52:00]  I heard that book  that book's a good lesson  because the reading  thing is just  throwing me for a loop  man  they say reading  makes you smarter  if that's the case  then how come  when you read a book  you have to put  the title of the book  on the top  of every single page  does anybody ever  get halfway through  a book  what the hell am I reading  so it's right there  at the top  okay  forget again  oh it's right there  that is handy  you know what 
[02:52:30]  you go to the movies  I don't put the title  of the movie  on the top of the screen  what are we watching  oh there it is  okay  wait  who's that  what  oh there it is  it's written clearly  you know  you don't got to do that  what are you going to do  is peek at your ticket stub  you're not going to be  looking up at no screen  you just take a gander  down at your stub  and you slip it back  in your pocket  nobody's the wiser  that's how you find out  what movie you're watching  reading's good right  you know  it's hard to bad mouth it 
[02:53:00]  you know  nobody could  you never see a  like a crossfire episode  about the benefits of reading  you know  and in the pro side  of reading  it was like a professor  with a bow tie  and in the opposite side  hey let me tell you something  reading  reading ain't never  reading ain't not never  reading ain't not never  um  you  you know what I'm saying  you know what I'm saying  oh yeah  yeah I know what you're saying 
[02:53:30]  Brian Regan  yes  well let me take a break  god damn  very good Brian  so 212-757-1027  we'll be back in just a bit  this just in  Monday afternoon at 3  on 1027 WNEW  it's the return of Opie and Anthony  and the return of WOW  we now return you  to your regularly scheduled stupidity  Opie and Anthony  this is Crash and Burn Radio 
[02:54:00]  enjoy it while it lasts  true syndication  destination now  oh my god  call the lawyers  you want me  WNEW  sorry  and Matt wants to say hi to Brian  Matt what's going on  hey guys what's up  hey  hey Matt  hey Brian Regan  you're awesome  thank you Matt  yo I have kind of two questions for you 
[02:54:30]  the first one is  I haven't been able to find your first TV yet  is it in like power records  I don't know if it's there  if you went to like amazon.com  it would be there  okay  or uh  Napster  oh that's true  my second question is  do you run a website somewhere  yeah you can just get it for free  if you want  you know you can get it on amazon.com  or if you don't want to pay any money  I don't always download it on Netflix  free is always better  well it's our CD 
[02:55:00]  actually you know  we don't even care  it gets our name out there  when people told me that  I was like so flattered  you know what I mean  like the Metallica thing  I can understand their gripe  you know  they have a point  but when I heard that  I was on there  I was like  man that's fantastic  hey do you run  do you run your own website anywhere  like stupidpeople.com  or something  uh not yet  so you may have  I have the domain name  that's the only stuff  I feel  you own 
[02:55:30]  reserve the name  you own brianregan.com  yeah it spent the 75 bucks  or whatever it is  to get the name  and that's about  all I know how to do  it took me like  8 months to figure that out  I'm going to go get  your stuff from Napster then  I don't think you heard  the first part  amazon.com  that's if you want to pay  Matt seriously  Tower Records usually  has it in the comedy section  I've seen it there  many times  and Borders  and Borders  I never thought  to look there  it's a great CD  we play clips from it  all the time  here's a  one of my takes 
[02:56:00]  on Napster  that I heard  it's an upgrade  if you bought vinyl  many years ago  and all of a sudden  they change the format  of the music  and it is now  it's not  it's not modern  the record player  so they put out  new equipment  CD players  why should I have to  then pay again  for the same music  that I already bought  on vinyl  so I am just 
[02:56:30]  getting the upgrade  off of Napster  for the music  I already have  these are like  albums that you've had  since the 70s  that's how I justify it  he doesn't want to buy  the Yes album  I'm also all for food borrowing  you just walk into someone's house  you open their fridge  and start eating  and go  no we're just sharing  I'm file sharing  in your refrigerator  food sharing  oh man  so  Brian was telling us  a little story  about the emergency room 
[02:57:00]  during the break  he was cracking us up  I had to go  myself  I had like  a stomach virus thing  and it was 2 o'clock  in the morning  my wife was watching  Christopher  so she couldn't take me  I almost called  an ambulance  and it's weird  well it's weird  considering calling  an ambulance  for yourself  you know  you always figure  you call an ambulance  for somebody else  what do you say  about yourself  can you come get me  yeah I don't feel  so hot  could you do  the code blue  where you don't  stop for nobody  and just come on in 
[02:57:30]  I'll be sitting  on the couch  rubbing my belly  I'm just looking  at the phone  I don't think  you're allowed  to call an ambulance  for yourself  so I drove myself  to the emergency room  which has to be  a worse option  it's 2 o'clock  in the morning  I show up  at the entrance  and they don't have  any valet parking  at the emergency room  if there's ever  a place  where they should  have a valet parking  stand  if there's ever  a time  we're going to go  can you park this  because I need  to collapse immediately  but now  I've got to deal  with please  take the ticket 
[02:58:00]  you know  when I'm driving  around this lot  hey can I park there  I think I'm going  to die  I'm dying too  ok go ahead  I'll go up  a couple levels  it doesn't matter  if you're driving  yourself  or somebody else  if you're driving  somebody  you still want  to hop out  with them  at the door  you're supposed  to drop  somebody off  while you go  park  ok you go in  tell them you're  shot  ask them  if they validate  you take care 
[02:58:30]  of the bullet wounds  and I'll handle  parking  we'll work it out  50-50  and then you know  I go in there  at 2 o'clock  in the morning  I would think  that that would be  all they need to know  to start doing stuff  the fact that you  show up at a hospital  at 2 a.m.  right  must mean  hey he's here  start sticking tubes  up his nose  what else are you  showing up for  man I'm bored  I saw your lights on 
[02:59:00]  and I was wondering  who's up for canasta  I got a hankering  for some canasta  like you wouldn't believe  but I got to you know  check in  with the question  they ask  it kills me  they throw  they say  what seems to be  the problem  the seems part  is so insulting  what seems to be  the problem  well it seems  it seems like  every hole in my body 
[02:59:30]  is exploding  every liquid  imaginable  that's  that's what it  seems like  but you know  I'm no doctor  until it gets  analyzed  officially  by one of your  medical staff  in my own  delusional world  it seems like  there ain't no  moisture left  inside me  they put you in a bag  in this room 
[03:00:00]  you know  it's like  they do a half room  kind of thing  with a curtain  down the middle  with a mystery patient  on the other side  you know  you just see  the silhouette  over there  what the hell  is the matter  with that person  I'm laying there  and that person  over there  is moaning  you know  I'm like  man  they're never  gonna help me  with him moaning  like that  so I gotta outmoan him  you know  he's like  he's cranking it up  quit moaning 
[03:00:30]  we're all hurting  it's the emergency room  they know this  you know  the nurse  as much as you  run around  holding their ears  it's gotta be  hell to work  in this environment  then they come in  and nurse is like  she asks  how you feeling  and I said  you know  terrible  you know  do you have like  a painkiller  she goes  how would you  describe your pain 
[03:01:00]  what kind of question  otherworldly  I don't know  it's hard for me  to find adjectives  that can cover  this pain  she goes  well how would you  rate it then  how would you rate it  on a scale of  one to ten  with ten being  the worst pain  well you know  saying two  ain't gonna get you  nothing  oh I'm a two  maybe the high ones  if you could  give me a baby  aspirin  and cut it in half  maybe a Flintstone

[03:02:00]  and come hobbling  into my room  who the hell  had the audacity  to say they were  at a level ten  you know nothing  about ten  give me a sled  camera  let me show you  what ten  is all about  Mr. Tummyache  I'm fine now  I ended up  I had the sniffles  ah the sniffles  the sniffles  what the hell

[03:03:30]  how simple  my material  was  I was thirsty  and bought  some water  and drank  it  it was  good  that's funny  I was going to  throw that in  a night  man  wait a second  the real  Brian Regan  would have  done a joke  instead of  just saying  stupid things  like I did  the real  Brian Regan  would have  had a bit  I just  talked  and repeated  what I said  until I made 
[03:04:00]  people angry  the real  Brian Regan  would have  said something  funny  I don't have  that kind  the material  I don't know  about that  man  hey this is  Frank Caliendo  how you doing  Frank  I'm doing  all  I was going to  keep being  used  I blew it  I blew the whole  illusion  how you doing  me  you tore it  down the wall  how am I  yeah  it's like  you're in a play  and you talk  to the audience  hey what do you  think we're doing  pretty good  I gotta get back  to talking  to King Lear  all right

[03:05:00]  how you doing  I'm doing good  listen I was  wondering  how I could  get into  doing some  comedy  I mean I  the other day  I was thinking  about back  to my childhood  and you might  have recalled  oh Al  we're losing  him  but I'd be  really into  it's tough  when you're  driving  you know  what I'm  saying  yeah  we got you  now man  yeah there you  go  you got a  cup of  dirt  that's what  I was trying  to get to  you  guess what  friends 
[03:05:30]  it didn't  work out  that would  blow my  mind  to see  Al Pacino  doing my  cup of  dirt  thank you  Frank  sorry  it wasn't  that funny  it was good  your phone  was crapping  out on us  oh it wasn't  yeah  let's  let's blame  it on that  and I look  forward to hearing  your John  Madden  one day  too  man  I hear  that  oh yeah  go ahead  someday 
[03:06:00]  that guy  see  when you  in that  and there  you go  sometimes you got  a cell phone  that works real good  that means there's a tower  nearby  and if you got a tower  nearby  that's a good thing  and when there's no tower  nearby  that's a bad thing  and good things  as we know  are better than bad things  bad things  aren't as good  as good things  sometimes there's a good thing  that can be a bad thing  for somebody else 
[03:06:30]  and that's not the  that's not the best  kind of thing  for that person  but at least it's good for you  and when it's good for you  and it's not good for them  there's good and bad  and good versus evil  there's the garden of Eden  and you know  that's the Bible  you probably read about that  there  and he ate  what gave the forbidden fruit  there  and  hey  hey Frank  thank you  alright I'll leave you guys alone  yeah come see you soon  alright  alright we'll talk to you later

[03:08:00]  some ideas  for party games  and we didn't know  what to tell them  I don't know  I would think  maybe some  pin the tail  on the donkey  I think that's a great  idea for kids  don't you think it's  kind of dangerous  though  well no  I think  I don't know  what people were thinking  when they came up  with pin the tail  on the donkey  alright we're gonna  have a whole bunch  of kids over  we're gonna blindfold  one  give them something  sharp  spin them around  and let them go  go Bobby  with the pin
