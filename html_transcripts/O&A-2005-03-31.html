<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of World War II-era propaganda songs containing extremely offensive lyrics targeting Japanese people. This led to a conversation about the evolution of political correctness and hypothetical contemporary propaganda songs about Iraq, acknowledging the shift away from overt racism.  The hosts then criticized Fox News's alleged use of euphemisms to describe violence in the Middle East and made disparaging remarks about Arab airport security.  Following this, John and Al, two callers who were in-studio guests, presented a comedic musical parody of *Silence of the Lambs*, including songs like "The Lotion Song" and "Are You About a Size 14?".

A major segment featured Anthony's Tony Danza impersonation, during which he prank-called a listener, Joan (a former *Family Feud* contestant), offering her $10,000 to perform oral sex on him backstage before his show and rush the stage at a specific time.  The show then played several vintage, sexist and racist cigarette commercials, followed by a 1970s public service announcement about LSD featuring a woman's bizarre hallucinatory experience with a talking hot dog. The broadcast concluded with a discussion of listener submissions and the curation of old show content.

A subsequent segment detailed a listener's hallucinatory experience involving a talking hot dog while on LSD, which culminated in a panic-induced run down the street and the discovery of a turkey in a baby's crib.  This was followed by a pre-arranged prank call to a radio station, where Opie and Anthony pretended to interview William Shatner.  The prank involved playing some of Shatner's music, leading to an unexpected call from Shatner himself.  The conversation focused on his albums "Has Been" and "Transform Man," with Jim Norton mediating the playful ribbing between Anthony and Shatner.  Big Kev was mentioned as being involved in setting up the prank.  Another prank call involving Tony Danza was also included in this section.  Bruce Kelly also called in to discuss the show's evolution on XM Satellite Radio.

Another excerpt detailed a prank call where a team member, Eric ("Sex Bagel"), attempted to interview a woman at a Tony Danza show while wearing a show t-shirt.  This resulted in a physical altercation with Danza's security personnel, leading to phone confiscations, threats of arrest, and Eric's escape. The hosts provided a running commentary, speculating about the security guard's actions and potential legal recourse.  This segment also included a call from a listener who created the persona "Donkey Sausage,"  Jim Norton's complaints about his coffee and the resultant punishment of an intern (reading from *Rent Boys*), and numerous anecdotes about Jim Norton’s childhood defecation experiences.

The show also featured a discussion of Jim Norton’s childhood experiences, including vague allusions to possible childhood sexual abuse and a running joke surrounding the "unsolved mystery" of his childhood.  This led into a highly sexualized discussion of Norton's sexual experiences and fantasies, including a fabricated game called "Monster Rain."  A substantial portion focused on playing recordings of Frankie Blue, a former, intoxicated WNEW program director, making on-air blunders.  The hosts discussed his dismissal and WNEW's performance since Opie and Anthony's departure. The show concluded with discussion of their vacations and a successful publicity stunt involving large signs displayed during a *Good Morning America* broadcast.

Finally, a segment began with a call from Jimmy's mother expressing concern about his admission to quitting sex work. This was followed by prank calls to the show's gift shop, supposedly from Ronald Reagan, featuring sexually suggestive and ageist comments about Nancy Reagan and other women, referencing other figures like Ted Kennedy and his own Alzheimer's disease.  The calls involved interactions with several gift shop employees, including a character named Sally. The show then concluded.

[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  So many things rhymed with Jap back then.  So easy to write a song.  You're a sad Mr. Jap.  All right, let's listen to just a piece of Remember Pearl Harbor.  Wipe the Jap from the mat.  Remember Pearl Harbor  When you strike down the bell of your gun 
[00:06:30]  Remember Pearl Harbor  Never stop till you drop everyone  Isn't bomb for bomb  Isn't shell for shell  Fill a hundred maps  For every boy that fell  Please remember Pearl Harbor  Wipe the Jap from the mat  Isn't hell  Brush, brush, brush your teeth 
[00:07:00]  Brush, oh, sorry  Sounded like that  Down on the wide blue sea  A warrior isle of sunshine  Lay so peacefully  Then from the sky without warning yet  The vultures swarmed to attack  Hiding behind their peace talk  They stabbed our boys in the black 
[00:07:30]  Remember Pearl Harbor  Every hour, every day that we live  Remember Pearl Harbor  And the crime we can never forgive  Through the sweat and toil  Through the blood and tears  Keep this battle cry ringing in our ears  Remember Pearl Harbor 
[00:08:00]  Let the song keep us strong  Through the years  All right, enough of that  Remember Hiroshima  Yeah, I think we won in the end  I think I know how that turns out  I think we persevere and remember Pearl Harbor  And barbecue a couple of hundred thousand of them  A little more than that  A little more than that  So it's just amazing  I mean, if you had these type of songs today  All the outrage  I know  You should do that  All right, the next one 
[00:08:30]  Stupid insurgents  What rhymes with insurgents?  Maybe that's why there's no songs  Give the enemy stupid names now  You can't  How the hell are you going to do that?  The next one, just a piece  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap?  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it  Of course he is  Written by Bob Miller  Performed by Carson Robinson  By Carson Rob  Typo, hopefully  Who wrote Slap the Little Jap? 
[00:09:00]  Ed Norton  They were good, I remember they opened it  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it  Yeah  We'll skin that streak of yellow from the sneaky little fella  And he'll think the cyclone struck him when we're through it  We'll take that double crosser to the old woodshed  We'll start right on his bottom and we'll go to his head 
[00:09:30]  When we get done with him  He'll wish that he was dead  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap  Uncle Sam's a man  Who's given a helping hand  To many a foreign land  Don't forget it  But when somebody goes to tromp him on his toes  They'd better guard their nose or they'll regret it  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it  The Japs and all their hooey will be changed into chop suey 
[00:10:00]  And the rising sun will set when we get through it  Their alibi for fighting is to save their face  For ancestors waiting in celestial space  We'll kick their precious face down to the other place  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap  Goddamn Japs  You want to go out and get him now?  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap 
[00:10:30]  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it  Yes, sir  I wouldn't fool you, mister  He can raise an awful blister  And somebody's pants will burn before we're through it  We'll reach across the ocean  And grab that yellow Jap  And turn him upside down right on democracy's lap  We'll blister his axis and do it with a snap  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap  Uncle Sam is mild, as peaceful as a child  But never get him wild or you will rue it 
[00:11:00]  So now they want to fight  Well, they've bit off quite a bite  And Uncle Sam is going to make them chew it  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it  All right, you get the idea there  It goes on forever, but...  Of course it does  I smell bit, Anthony  I smell bit  Yeah?  I think the listeners are talented enough  To come up with some current propaganda songs  Ah, a little few titles for Iraq  Yeah  We're going to have to cracky the dirty little Iraqi 
[00:11:30]  But you have to have it sung in this fun-loving way  Of course it's fun  Like they did back in the day  Back then, they could dance to that  Lovely  I just, I just, I don't know  I just loved it when we were all just openly racist  Yeah  Because we weren't even trying to hide it back then  Who are you kidding?  We're all racist  Every single person that listens to this program  Has racism in their blood  I don't care if you're a black guy listening  A white guy  A trucker 
[00:12:00]  A mom  A dirty little Jap  Or even a dirty little Jap  We are all racist  The problem is that we just make believe we're not nowadays  Back then, it was open  Ah, people didn't care  Man, I used to hang out at the Legion with my dad when he was alive  And man, these guys would just trash each other  Of course  There was a Jewish guy there  A black guy there  A Polish guy  An Irish guy  An Italian  And these guys would just go at each other's throats  They all walked into a bar  Yeah, they had the best racist jokes 
[00:12:30]  That they just would pound each other with  Yep  Pound each other  And my dad explained  This is just how it was when he was growing up  Yeah  The good old days when the Klan just hated colors  Remember that?  They expanded  I remember  What?  See, that's  But that's the problem  That was the problem  But back then, no one hid behind political correctness  Everyone was just openly racist  Even in war now  You can't be racist  Which is hysterical  You're over there  You're killing people  Which is good 
[00:13:00]  But you should at least, you know  Be allowed to write little ditties like this  Yeah  They did it back then  You know, the Japs came over and bombed Pearl Harbor  And they wrote some songs about it  And, you know, it wasn't like  That nice little Asian gentleman needs a talking to  Right  No, it was, you know  Gotta slap the dirty little Jap  Well, we have to be careful with the coverage  We were talking about this a while ago  But it was brought up on TV the other day  Another suicide bomber  Yes  They had a big story about another suicide bomber 
[00:13:30]  And, no, it's called  Yeah  Homicide bomber is what Fox News calls them  No  Are you serious?  Because they don't want to  They don't want to put the focus on the bomber  They want to put the focus on the people that were killed  So instead of calling it a suicide bomber  They call it a homicide bomber  But, meanwhile, any bombing that kills someone is a homicide bombing  Whether the guy plants the bomb and runs away  Or straps it to his body and dies  The thing that separates it is the fact that the suicide bomber is blowing himself up 
[00:14:00]  So a homicide bombing means nothing  Right  A roadside bombing is a homicide bombing if it kills somebody  Fox News trying to be politically correct  Trying to alter your viewpoint a little bit  They don't call marine snipers snipers  They're called sharpshooters  They're called sharpshooters  Yeah  Because sniper has bad stigma to it  And they don't call them terrorists  They call them freedom fighters or something  Well, some of them do  But maybe Al Jazeera 
[00:14:30]  Who calls them freedom fighters?  I don't know  Well, they don't call them terrorists  They call them something  I'll get back to you on that  Don't get back to me on that one  You know, you go in the airport  You get checked by Arabs  Are checking me  Really?  You know, you've never seen at the airport  Oh, I've seen that  You know, they're checking me to see if they have it  You know, what they're going to do  Yeah  We were in L.A. in the airport  They had a sign in American  And then they had a sign under it in Arabic  Why? 
[00:15:00]  I'm not lying  You know, whatever  Don't do this, do that  In Arabic  An American  That was good  Anyone that reads it  You can see who's looking at it  And sweep them right up  Take them in the back  And work them over with a phone book  Yeah, whose eyes are going from left to right  Yeah  See whose eyes are going from left  Or is it right to left  Or how do they read?  Reading that drivel  Ugh  How do you read that?  It's backwards, right?  Oh, they're all backwards  Dirt people  It's right to left  Starting from the bottom  Dirt people  Working their way up  I don't know  And then we'll get back to more of these songs 
[00:15:30]  We've got a few others  We've got Your Sap, Mr. Jap  I like that sap thing  And Goodbye Mama, I'm off to Yokohama  You could use that one  Goodbye Mama, I'm hunting Osama  There you go  Something like that  I'm feeling a bit though  I'm smelling it  I'm smelling the bit  What is Patty doing here?

[00:22:00]  Well, they haven't checked out any of the other stations yet  They're so loyal to us  They just listen to us 24 hours a day  So I guess we should tell them  There are other fine channels on this thing they call XM  Yeah, they could switch over  Hear some music maybe  Maybe some other comedy that isn't us  Sure, have fun with it  They've been pretty cool  I think they got a big kick out of the language  You know, the freedom you get to say certain words  Or just content and stuff  So they were pretty happy with that  I don't think it's that big a change though 
[00:22:30]  As far as the show goes on the whole  You get pretty familiar with it  Nothing really big  Not that big a change  Did you just go for a serious answer to a question?  No  That was a very serious answer  Oh, sorry  I didn't mean to  It's a valid point  We don't really care what our listeners think  Yeah, that's true  We don't even care what anyone thinks in this room  It's all about you  I just care about how late that clock is ticking  We've actually lost a lot of listeners to the 80s channel and Bob Edwards  Dr. Laura and our art and us are going to do a little cross-promotion  Have you seen Bob Edwards?

Well, you know  I'd like one too  One with him in a Spider-Man suit  With that luscious hog  All right, well  That was great  Here it comes  That was really good  Another successful Tony Danza phone call 
[00:37:00]  Can't lose  They love Tony  The worst of O and A  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet  Complete with XM interlocutors  And they ain't body parts  XM's high voltage 202  The virus is now free  Yeah, sure  I know the Opie and Anthony theme song  One, two, three  Do, do, do, do, do, do  Opie  Da, da, da, da, da  Anthony  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da 
[00:37:30]  Da, da, da, da  The guy Jim  Da, da, da, da  Opie  Da, da, da, da  Anthony  Da, da, da, da, da, da  The guy Jim  Da, da, da, da  Opie.  Anthony.  What's the problem?  It's better than Green Acres.  Celebrating the first free week of O&A. 
[00:38:00]  I've heard worse.  Something tells me it's not true.  Opie and Anthony interlocular.  The legendary black earl from the O&A virus.  He's not only black earl because he's black, but because he...  I wear all black.  All the time.  Why's that?  I like the color.  No other reason.  I like the color.  Let me see your underwear.  Here it is.  Black earl is black all the way around.  Black earl, what originally drew you to Opie and Anthony? 
[00:38:30]  Funny.  Just plain funny.  They were different.  They were new guys.  We always welcomed new guys.  It was just something different.  It was just such a vibe thing.  It was like, these guys are going to bring something to the table that we've never seen  before and probably will never see again.  Especially if they get fired again.  Yeah, especially if they get fired again.  You're the sales guy for Opie and Anthony.  You need to sell the rest of the XM nation on the O&A virus.  Everybody who's never heard of them or haven't heard them yet on XM, go ahead. 
[00:39:00]  If you want unfiltered, uncensored, brilliant comedy, brilliant commentary, debauchery, you know, this is the show.  And again, unfiltered and to paraphrase another show, no spin, no nonsense.  It's just, it's what it is.  And it's the truth.  Oh, it is the truth.  For everyone who has XM and has not listened to Opie and Anthony, this is a unique and wonderful opportunity to hear a fabulous show. 
[00:39:30]  It's different.  It's edgy.  It's informative.  It's funny.  It'll probably make you barf on one occasion.  But it's just something special.  And XM listeners are going to be in for something that's truly amazing.  We got it all on tape, that guy.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:40:00]  I'm going to make so much money off these assholes.  Highly underpaid.  Hey, guys, hope you're enjoying the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're going to be back live, I think, April 11th, live from Boston at Bill's Bar for opening day, Sox Yankees. 
[00:40:30]  We're doing the show from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the East Coast, I believe.  It's going to be a crazy time at Bill's Bar.  We're hoping to see a lot of you guys out there.  Maybe some old faces from our Boston days and a lot of new faces.  Wheelchair Fred.  Wheelchair Fred's going to make an appearance.  Yep.  But in the meantime, you're stuck listening to the worst of.  But I think there's some really good stuff that we've been playing the last few days.  Certainly.  This is one of my favorite bits since coming to XM Satellite Radio, I've got to tell you.  It's when Anthony went off on the whole cigarette ad thing.  Oh, right.  I remember that like it was yesterday.  I think Steve found some old cigarette ads, some old cigarette radio commercials. 
[00:41:00]  And Ed just went off on a tangent.  You know, that's the beauty of doing the show with Anthony.  Sometimes you just don't know where he's going to go.  And this is one of the standout bits we've done since coming to XM Satellite Radio.  A brilliant improv.  Check it out.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  So, Anthony, we got the Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  Yeah.  We mentioned this earlier.  A little earlier.  The times they did a change.  They used to be able to have cigarette ads on television. 
[00:41:30]  And even cartoon characters.  Which now, you can't have a cartoon character hawking anything now.  Or else they say you're exploiting the children, harming the children.  But back in the old days, cigarettes.  Who was this?  Winston, I think.  Winston.  Fred and Barney.  They sure work hard, don't they, Barney?  Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard.  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back where we can't see them. 
[00:42:00]  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.  Okay.  How's about taking a nap?  Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.  Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes the big taste difference.  And only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, ahead of the pure white filter,  Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected 
[00:42:30]  and specially processed for good flavor in filter smoking.  Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  The Flintstones have been brought to you by Winston,  America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette.  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  Wilma, Wilma, Wilma, I've got to get to the rock quarry. 
[00:43:00]  They took my throat out.  I got throat cancer from Winston cigarettes.  Barney, Barney, could you pedal the car with your feet today?  I'm weak from the chemo.  Ah.  That cartoon's hawking butts.  They show Betty in one episode having to fill one side of the bra with tissue  because she smoked for a long time. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  Why, Betty?  Why, I'm Betty.  Oh, we're going to the silly zone again.  All right.  Well, there you go.  The Flintstones talking about cigarettes.  That's a little strange.  The voices were a little off, though, right?  Yeah, it almost sounded like fake Fred.  It sounded like...  Hey, Barney.  Yeah, it sounded like Jackie Gleason.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, that cartoon was based on the Honeymoon.  Based on the Honeymoon.  Stolen from.  I hated the Flintstones. 
[00:44:00]  Stolen?  Did you?  I loved it growing up.  Jetsons, too.  Hated it.  I hated the Jetsons.  Loved the Flintstones, though.  God.  I don't like Bugs Bunny because there was a viciousness to it.  Bugs was great.  Probably the best cartoons ever made were the old Warner Brothers cartoons.  But now they cut out all the violence when you see...  Of course.  When you see Bugs Bunny now.  All those cartoons were all about the violence.  It's all about smashing people on the heads with frying pans  and shooting them in the face with shotguns.  And then they cut it to pieces now. 
[00:44:30]  Nice to Bunny.  Hooray.  Bugs Bunny smashing his face on the ground.  Oh.  I loved it.  I loved those cartoons.  Growing up, watched them all the time.  I can't believe you didn't like the whole nastiness.  Never liked them.  Bugs was just a nasty thing.  I loved Bugs Bunny.  Oh, you did?  No, I loved them.  I thought you said you didn't like Bugs Bunny.  No, I hate the Flintstones.  I like Bugs Bunny.  I'm so confused.  No, no.  Bugs Bunny was great, man.  That's like that's the best cartoon.  It is.  Uh-oh.  F-ing idiots.  Peter from Whackbag.com. 
[00:45:00]  What cigarette did Opie smoke?  Chesterfields?  No, he kicked that habit.  Right in the liver.  A lot of rumors flying around.  Yeah.  As far as this show goes.  I don't know why.  What are you giving me, Eric?  People love Lost in Space.  Oh, okay.  I see.  All right.  Thank you.  What did you give Opie?  Just cartoon theme songs.  Oh, what is it?  What are you drinking, Ben?  A little water?  Can we get more coffee?  I'm fading.  Go off.  Get him, Terry. 
[00:45:30]  Opie wants coffee.  Let's go.  Coffee.  All right.  Well, we have the Winston commercials, too.  You want to try a couple of these?  Yeah.  Let's hear some of these olden day commercials.  Oh, no, this is for Newport.  Newport.  Yo, B.  I loves the Newport.  Hey!  Groovy.  Just give me a coffee.  Newport tastes fresher. 
[00:46:00]  Tastes better, too.  I'm decorating.  Newport tastes fresher.  Tastes better, too.  This is just conjure up images of walking into the Copa, smoking cigarettes and drinking  it.  Than any other menthol cigarette.  Walking through the back of the Copa.  Walking through the back.  I think that's about it.  I think that's about it.  Up front.  I think that's about it.  It's just a jingle.  That one's great.  That music's great, ain't it?  And then this one's for Lucky Strike, old cigarette ads. 
[00:46:30]  Lucky Strike, first again with Tobacco Men.  First again with Tobacco Men.  What?  L-S-M-F-T.  L-S-M-F-T. 
[00:47:00]  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Yes, in a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts.  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  So round, so firm, so fully packed, so free and easy on the draw.  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco, Lucky Strike. 
[00:47:30]  And remember, collards, use your own water fountain.  Don't these just all sound?  Yes, Lucky Strike.  Smoke them without Negroes around.  After you've run the fire hose on black people, enjoy the draw of a nice Lucky Strike.  Yes, Lucky Cigarettes.  To be enjoyed without the pain and agony of having black people around. 
[00:48:00]  You could walk into a diner that doesn't serve Negroes and light up a Lucky Strike.  So after you go home and beat your wife, draw on a nice Lucky Strike.  You'll be lucky there are no Negroes in your neighborhood.  Because you're white and live in America.  And you're free not to live near black people.  And smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Ah, the good old days. 
[00:48:30]  That's wonderful.  What do you call a black guy that's smoking a cigarette?  Um.  See, you laughed.  I wanted to tell you the answer there.  What was the answer?  I'm not saying that.  You're wrecking the timing of the bit.  You call him nicotine.  What?  That's what's in the cigarette.  Nicotine.  Oh, nicotine.  That's what I said.  Nicotine.  I mean, okay.  Enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes. 
[00:49:00]  And enjoy your whiteness.  And the whiteness of your neighborhood.  Your family.  Your workplace.  The water fountain.  The buses.  Every place in America.  Lucky Strike.  The official cigarette of the Send Them Back to Africa campaign.  Feel that draw.  The pleasure of smoking and living in a white country. 
[00:49:30]  After you sick the German shepherds on some Negroes, enjoy Lucky Strike cigarettes.  They're wonderful like white people.  They just all sound like that.  You can tell it's old.  Right.  There's something about the sound you can tell.  There's just that sound of rampant racism in it.  Let's try a cigarette spot for Montclair. 
[00:50:00]  Montclair.  Montclair.  Montclair cigarettes.  Montclair cigarettes.  Now, a cigarette that's low in tar and nicotine.  High in menthol flavor.  New Montclair.  Just enough in every puff makes every puff a pleasure.  How much is just enough?  Just enough menthol to please your taste.  Montclair's new charcoal menthol filter does it.  Charcoal granules that are both activated and mentholated release just enough menthol to freshen every puff. 
[00:50:30]  So every puff tastes as good as the first puff.  What's so modern about Montclair?  Modern.  The answer is in Montclair's modern menthol flavor.  Yet Montclair is surprisingly low in tar and nicotine.  But the flavor's still there when you smoke Montclair.  Just enough in every puff makes every puff a pleasure.  Smoke Montclair.  New from the American Tobacco Company. 
[00:51:00]  Mmm.  That sounds good.  More mellow.  Yeah, that's a mellow one.  You want another lucky strike?  We'll try one more lucky strike.  Lucky.  Places all.  All join hands.  Circle left.  Now circle right and listen to me.  L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Elementary corners like swinging on a gate.  To right to your honey with a right to left eight.  Grand right to left around you go.  Lucky strike means find a back goal.  Meet your honey and give her a whirl. 
[00:51:30]  All swing around with your little girls.  Smoke them, smoke them.  Then you'll see L-S-L-S-M-F-T.  Promenade and don't you fall.  Promenade around the hall.  Lucky strike is first again.  First again with tobacco men.  Promenade straight down the pike.  It's time right now for a lucky strike.  Yes, first smoking that you're bound to like.  You just can't beat a lucky strike. 
[00:52:00]  Yes, sir.  They're playing that chicken picking music.  I hope whoever wrote that never smoked and still got cancer.  Swing up, partner, to and fro.  Look around, no black sambo.  Ah, yes, lucky strike's a wonderful flavor.  Taste the draw of lucky strike as you drop your children off at an all-white school.  No negroes here. 
[00:52:30]  The only place you want charcoal is in your filter.  The charcoal filter of lucky strike.  Wonderful.  That's also the only place you want par, baby, is in your cigarette.  Not walking the streets of your all-white neighborhood.  Lucky strike.  What a wonderful cigarette.  Good for dining, dancing, or lynching.  Light up a lucky strike.  You can light it off your Zippo lighter, a match, or a burning cross on a negro's lawn. 
[00:53:00]  Whatever it takes, light up that lucky strike.  You know why lucky strike cigarettes are so good?  Look at them.  They're white.  That's right.  When have you ever saw a black cigarette?  Never.  Because it couldn't possibly be good.  Lucky strike with their wonderful white paper.  Smoke luckies.  Because we don't like negroes.  There it is. 
[00:53:30]  What a time.  What a time we lived in.  I think we have one more for lucky strike.  Lucky again?  I mean, no, let's try a Newport.  Another Newport ad.  These were boring, though, right?  We didn't like the first one.  I don't know.  It's kind of jazzy.  Scooby-doo-wah-wah.  Smooth and fresh is the Newport taste.  Never harsh, never rough. 
[00:54:00]  The smoothest-tasting menthol cigarette.  Wah-wah.  King size and new deluxe 100s.  Little tune written for a cigarette ad, 1936.  You think she had to kill the cigarette because it was talking to her?  That voice.  Do you notice that the menthol ads all have a cool, mellow thing?  Like that was the message that was like, you hang back and have a menthol ad. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  Right.  But the other cigarettes, lucky.  Smoking lucky.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  Of course, Jersey again.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, bitch-ditch?  Hi, John.  I don't appreciate that type of language.  I just want to tell you guys, when Anthony said he was going to stick to German Shepherds,  I almost drove into a ditch.  You guys rock.  This is the part of the program where we allow you to compliment the bitch. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, thank you.  I'm tearing down the third wall for everyone, Anthony, so we can feel a little better about  ourselves.  What's that?  What is that, Eric?  I have no idea.  Eric, what are you doing?  A pack of Marlboros.  You ever heard that theory that the Marlboro box was designed like the KKK thing, the hoods  and the way you do it?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's been around for years, that theory.  Yeah, there are all kinds of rumors like that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I don't think Marlboro is in cahoots with the Klan.  This is the new and improved Opie and Anthony show, so we don't beat things into the ground. 
[00:55:30]  So we'll try not to.  We're going to say cut right there.  All right.  And end the bit.  End the bit.  Bravo to Anthony.  It is over.  Coming up with that on the fly.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for the musical accompaniment in there.  Derek.  The only time you went tar, baby, is in your cigarette.  That was great.  Richard, Jenny, coming up.  No, I didn't live in those times.  I was saying those were some...  The guy's like, how old are you? 
[00:56:00]  No, I wasn't around during those.  Yeah.  That's right.  Sure.  It's called a bit, silly.  All right.  Oh, God.  Yeah, me, Burt Lancaster.  We would go out and smoke.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Whoa.  I thought the voiceover guy was in the room with us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, look, man.  I want to eat lunch.  Thank you.  This is the dropping acid PSA. 
[00:56:30]  Next.  Well, you know what, though?  This is a...  I love this piece of audio, though.  It's something like hippie, trippy chick from San Francisco that was dropping acid for the  first time or something like that.  Yeah, it tells her bad experience with dropping acid and it was supposed to teach the kids so  they didn't do it.  This made me want to do acid.  Really?  You wanted to see a...  Oh, yeah.  Especially when the hot dog comes to life.  Yeah.  Don't ruin it.  Oh.  You spoiler of things.  I'm kind of feeling bad about myself now. 
[00:57:00]  No, now.  It probably hurt anyway.  Yeah, that's true.  Unless you're one of these new shitheads that's just tuning in because we're off the premium  channel.  Thanks, cheapo.  Shinsy fuckers.  That's what you deserve.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  You know what, Ant?  It's really early and I think it would be very effective if we played that drop acid  PSA right away.  Oh, yeah.  I like this one.  Well, every day we're finding stuff that we used to play on the old show.  We forgot about a lot of things because we were off the air for two years and we weren't 
[00:57:30]  able to take any of our stuff with us.  So slowly but surely we're rebuilding the show.  Yeah.  And it's been kind of fun to rediscover things.  I know we hadn't heard them in quite a while, didn't have them, and now they're just turning  up.  What, do people send these in or is Eric finding them?  Well, Eric is amazing.  Sex Bagel does a great job for the radio show and then the listeners are just taking it upon  themselves going, God, I can't believe they don't have this clip and they're not playing  it yet.  And they're sending in stuff all the time.  Thank you.  We've said over the years that the Opie and Anthony show is truly the people's radio program. 
[00:58:00]  Yes.  You know, when we start sucking, that's when the listeners need to do their part.  Oh, I thought you were going to blame them.  Yeah.  Well, in a way I am.  When they start sucking, it's your fault for not sending us stuff.  Well, they participate in the show and, you know, sometimes we need them a little more  than usual, right?  Right.  You know, maybe today we just tell the listeners, hey, this is your show today.  What do you want to hear?  Ooh.  What do you want to do with this program today?  That's really giving them a lot of responsibility. 
[00:58:30]  What would they ask for?  I know what these sick fucks would ask for.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of sex.  A lot of girls playing with themselves, which is just fine by me.  Yeah, so we got the drop acid PSA.  I hadn't heard this in quite some time.  This was something that came out, I guess, in the early 70s, maybe?  Yeah, when they were putting out a lot of PSAs about drugs, drug use.  Can't have your kid doing drugs.  So they figured that if a young person was telling people what it was like to do drugs 
[00:59:00]  and how bad it was, that maybe your kid wouldn't do drugs.  Right.  I think the scenario is this lady is kind of hanging out in San Francisco.  San Francisco.  Is Market Street in San Francisco?  I don't even know.  Yeah, I think so, right?  Yeah?  Anyone?  Bueller?  Yeah.  Anyone?  Anyone?  My brother's giving a thumbs up, so I guess so.  So this is an example of why you shouldn't drop acid.  Right.  Because drop acid was all the rage back in the early 70s. 
[00:59:30]  Dropping acid.  But they also kind of hint that marijuana might be a stepping stone.  Yeah, it starts with marijuana and ends with acid.  Acid.  So this thing made us, I don't know, laugh pretty hard this morning as we were preparing  for the show, and I think it's something you should play real early while people are still  kind of waking up and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's kind of creepy, too, you know, the sound effects and stuff.  The bad 60s and early 70s sound effects.  Right.  Check this out.  Synthesizer. 
[01:00:00]  I first dropped acid when I was 18.  I was over at these people's house one night.  This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.  I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, so I was  curious.  I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it, and I dropped it.  I don't know what I was waiting for, a flash or a rush or whatever, but I kept sitting there  waiting and waiting and nothing was happening. 
[01:00:30]  So I got up and then went to the dresser and put on a pair of pink capris and a green and  brown blouse.  I thought the colors were beautiful.  So we tripped down to Market Street, and I decided to buy a hot dog.  Uh-oh.  Ooh.  She decides to buy a hot dog.  Hippie chicken or pink capris.  Little top.  God damn hippies.  Eh.  With a little hairy armpit.  Oh, you know, she's just a mess.  Going out for a hot dog. 
[01:01:00]  And she's a stringy-haired, greasy, hippie mess back then.  And she leaves the house, and she's probably not tripping that much yet.  Yeah.  Probably thinking, hey, this is not that bad after all.  It's not bad.  It's just a little stronger than marijuana, but I think I can handle myself.  I'm going to hit the streets of San Francisco and get myself a hot dog.  My 70s Earth Mama Muff was pushing out my capris.  Right.  Big friggin' brillo pads.  Looked like I was smuggling a yo-yo in my capris.  All right, so she's stepping out to get her hot dog. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  So far, so good, right?  No problem.  She probably has the munchies from all the drug abuse.  From the pot.  There you go.  And I decided to buy a hot dog.  The flying saucer came down.  Oh, good.  Yeah, it sounds like Ed Wood.  Yeah.  Cut.  Print.  Perfect.  Perfect.  I was very hungry, and I had put mustard and ketchup and relish in the usual, and I put 
[01:02:00]  the hot dog up to my mouth, and somebody started screaming.  I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said, did you hear  that?  Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said, no.  He said, don't be a bummer.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, 
[01:02:30]  That's the sound effect of a scream back in the early 70s or something?  I know.  What the hell is that?  The Moog synthesizer.  I think it would have been much more effective if it was an actual scream, the hot dog screaming  at her.  But instead, they go with the sound effects.  I backed up a little bit.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder.  And it hit me.  No, it couldn't be.  And I looked down at the hot dog, and there was a face on him. 
[01:03:00]  Uh-oh.  What kind of face do you think was on the hot dog?  On a hot dog.  A little smiley wiener face.  What kind of, what was it?  Then I realized it wasn't a hot dog at all.  It was my friend Terry's cock.  I put it up to my mouth, and it spit at me.  You know Terry's having a good time, right?  He's in San Francisco.  Yeah, Terry's a professional.  Summer of love.  He's like, hey, he found a new broad.  Right.  He's thinking, hey, she can handle the acid like me. 
[01:03:30]  Free love.  We'll do a little acid.  We're going to go back to my pad and bang.  Yeah, we're going to eat some hot dogs, and she's going to eat my hot dog.  Right, yeah.  Under the black lights with the lava lamps rocking.  This hippie bitch is ready to screw it all up.  Jefferson Airplane playing in the background.  White Rabbit.  Right, of course it is.  This guy's like, yeah, baby.  Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, man.  But this broad is a buzzkill.  She's a bummer.  She's a real bummer.  She's seen faces in a hot dog.  In a hot dog. 
[01:04:00]  The summer of love.  Come on.  She's supposed to have a good time at San Francisco in the 60s, man.  Right.  Who sees faces in a hot dog?  Except this bitch.  Come on, Terry out.  Eyes, nose, a mouth.  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  Redhead.  Right about now, Terry's like, oh, great.  Oh, boy.  Now I'm going to have to babysit this acid head.  Right.  She's having a bad trip.  I'm going to go to Haight-Asbury and see if there's any other broads that I can pick up. 
[01:04:30]  Nose, a mouth.  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  And he started telling me that I couldn't eat him.  And he had a wife and seven kids at home to support.  And I stood there with this hot dog and asked Terry, do you know this hot dog is talking to me?  And he says, nah, let's get out of here.  What kind of answer is that?  Hot dog is talking to me?  Nah.  Let's get out of here. 
[01:05:00]  Let's screw.  Right.  Let's ball.  That's why he said, nah, let's get out of here.  He's thinking in his head.  All right.  She's ready for some action.  He knows she's just going to ruin everything.  The guy gave her the acid.  So he's like, he had the acid.  Probably used to it.  Yeah.  Knows how to do it and have a good goddamn time doing it.  And she is just wrecking.  You know he looked over and she said, the hot dog's talking and he's, oh, it's a babysitting  session now.  But that's why he wants to get out of there.  He thinks he can get one in before she really cracks. 
[01:05:30]  Quick, let's go back to my place.  We'll ball, man.  And then, you know, everything will be groovy.  Don't worry about it.  And then we'll crash.  Yeah.  And the hot dog admits he has a wife and seven kids.  I wonder if he spoke in a Mexican accent.  And he says, nah, let's get out of here.  He thought I was just faking.  And I told him, look at the thing.  He's got a face.  And he's screaming.  And the guy finally looked over and he got on the same trip that I was on. 
[01:06:00]  Thanks.  And we sat there carrying on a conversation with that hot dog.  Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating.  So I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It turns into a horror movie.  You know something?  Perhaps if you're on acid and your hot dog is talking to you,  even if you realize you're hallucinating and, like, you kind of talk yourself down a little bit, 
[01:06:30]  perhaps you should just write off eating the hot dog.  You know what I mean?  Like, you kind of reach the point where you're like, look, I'm hallucinating.  The hot dog isn't really talking to me.  Perhaps I should put the hot dog down, though, and walk away.  Right.  Not bite it.  You will let me know if that hot dog stops screaming.  God.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:07:00]  I've got to hear the scream.  So it screamed.  Listen to this again.  So I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town.  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  That wasn't a hot dog.  That was Terry's cock.  That was Terry screaming.  Terry screaming.  You weren't standing on Market Street.  You were back in the room.  And the hot dog only had one eye, you ass.  And you only thought it was sauerkraut because he hasn't washed his pubes in a few weeks. 
[01:07:30]  Hippie dirtbag.  Relish and sauerkraut.  I put it in my mouth and bit down.  Yeah.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town.  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  And I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  It was about this time I realized that I forgot about the turkey in the oven at the house I was babysitting the baby at. 
[01:08:00]  When I opened the oven, I was horrified.  I went back up to the crib and there was a turkey in the crib.  Where was the baby?  That old gag.  Oh, man.  I wish I lived during the acid years.  Doesn't that sound like fun?  Sounds like a great time.  Talking hot dogs.  Right.  She bit my hot dog.  Terry punched me in the face and poured hot coffee on my tits.  It's drinking. 
[01:08:30]  Only you.  I realized that I had murdered it.  Yeah.  And I took off screaming down the street.  Scared.  That must have been so funny to watch.  So, this chick, like, dude, you should have seen what I saw today on Market Street. 
[01:09:00]  This chick, like, she was kind of a hot, hippie chick, but she looked pretty fucked up.  And she's like, gets a hot dog and starts eating it.  And then, dude, she's talking to it.  She starts talking to it.  And then all of a sudden, she starts jumping up and down on it, screaming and running away.  It was great.  You should have seen it.  She freaked out.  Well, acid sounds great.  Yeah, it sure does.  And that's how it ends.  Her just running down the street screaming.  Running down Market Street screaming with hot dog on her shoe.  And I guess then the PSA just said, don't do acid. 
[01:09:30]  Don't do acid.  Or something like that.  Is that it?  I don't know.  They have a clever slogan?  Who knows?  I know.  I did mescaline.  That's about the only kind of acid type stuff I did.  Shrooms, bro.  Come on.  Shrooms?  Never did the shrooms.  I was a mescaline guy back, I guess, when...  Back in California?  No, no, no.  No, it was when Van Halen...  I forgot what Van Halen album it was, but it was definitely David Lee Roth.  And I went to the Nassau Coliseum, and I took some mescaline with my friends, and we 
[01:10:00]  were going to watch Van Halen.  And everyone was peeking, dude.  Everyone was peeking, except me.  I'm just sitting through the concert, you know, having a good time and stuff.  And then all of a sudden, David Lee Roth started screaming.  So I went...  I went...  I was the designated driver, because I wasn't...  You're the designated driver, and you're on mescaline.  But I wasn't feeling anything.  Everyone else is laughing their asses off, because mescaline just makes you laugh at everything.  It's very funny.  And I figured, you know, I'd drive, you know, because I drove there. 
[01:10:30]  And I...  Who am I saying designated driver?  I drove there.  I was driving back regardless of how fucked up I was.  We all get to the car, and hop in.  It's raining.  So we start driving out of the parking lot, and I notice the windshield wipers are starting  to really get loud, and I'm really noticing them.  Oh, you're completely focused on them?  Oh, man.  And I couldn't stop thinking about the windshield wipers.  Was it going in slow motion, too?  It started. 
[01:11:00]  Then the taillights of all the cars, because, you know, we're just getting out of a concert.  All you see are taillights everywhere.  And the way they were kind of...  The light of the taillight was being diffused on the drops on my windshield, and the windshield  wipers going back and forth.  And they were kind of going in slow motion.  And now the red taillights in the wipers were making these streamer kind of stretched out  red colors.  And the sound was just really getting...  With the red lights going. 
[01:11:30]  And I'm sitting there, and all of a sudden, I just started going...  And the guys in the car are like, dude, you all right?  I'm like, yeah.  Fine, man.  They're like, oh, Andy, he's fucked up, man.  Don't worry about it.  And I drove home.  It all of a sudden turns into a Cheech and John movie for you.  I was driving down the parkway.  Yeah.  And laughing.  Didn't know if I was doing 80 or 8 miles an hour. 
[01:12:00]  No clue.  Had no clue.  And that was my mescaline time at Van Halen.  But, you know, that kind of stuff, if you don't let it run away on you, it's kind of fun.  It is fun until you see faces in the hot dog.  Yeah, once you start getting hot dogs telling you to have families, and then biting it, and it's screaming, that would freak you out a little bit.  I know I ate glowing French fries when we went back down to the pizza place we all worked at.  And there were French fries underneath the heat lamp in the kitchen area. 
[01:12:30]  And we all came back from the concert, went to the restaurant we worked at because we'd get free food.  And we went into the kitchen.  And the French fries, I started eating them off the rack up top.  It was under the heat light.  And they were glowing like Marcellus Wallace's suitcase when John Travolta opened it up.  It glowed like that.  And I kept eating them.  And that kind of freaked me out a little bit because I thought I was going to have some kind of radiation in my stomach.  But no talking hot dog.  Just glowing French fries. 
[01:13:00]  With a face and seven kids.  Seven kids.  That's hilarious.  I wasn't screaming down Jericho Turnpike with French fry on my shoe.  Well, there you have it.  The drop acid PSA.  Yeah.  It's not all about that.  Nice.  That thing.  Groovy.  Yeah.  That was a trippy time back then, huh?  Have some acid, baby.  Yeah.  John in New York wants in.  Hey, John.  What's up?  Yeah.  You guys are talking about this.  I'm driving in the rain with the rain blowing on my windshield.  I'm starting to go into an acid flashback.  Ah. 
[01:13:30]  Do people really have flashbacks, though?  Who knows?  I don't know anyone who's ever had an acid flashback.  She probably did.  Yeah.  Let's go to...  Every time she eats a hot dog.  Oh, let's go to Montgomery, Alabama.  Alabama.  Robert, what's up?  Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener.  That's what I'd really like to be.  See you, love you.  There you go.  Singing right before she bit its head off with the red ketchup-y hair.  Yeah.  How does ketchup turn into hair? 
[01:14:00]  What does a hot dog with seven kids say?  Don't eat me.  That's what I was saying.  Freaking her out.  I'm just making my coffee.  Oh!  You're almost done with your oatmeal.  I know.  Did it have a little conversation with you?  It said, don't eat me.  I stink.  I'm a gluey mess.  I look like placenta.  Throw me out.  The replacement for nose picking.  Opie and Anthony.  Now free on the satellite. 
[01:14:30]  Behave accordingly.  I'm going to break that kid's legs.  O and A.  Opie and Anthony interlocular.  Wow.  So, okay.  XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly here with another Opie and Anthony interlocular.  The worst of O and A.  Jim, you've been on the show for the whole ride, up, down, all around?  Well, since the NAW, not the entire time, but since here, yeah.  What's the difference in coming from a stage and having to adjust to FM and then coming back with total freedom of XM? 
[01:15:00]  The language freedom is great, you know, and there's less time to eat.  That wraps it up.  What's the difference in O and A 2000, O and A 2005?  Wow.  What's the difference?  That's easier to do the show.  I know what the...  It's just, it's a little easier to touch on certain subject matter.  You know, we still do a lot of the same, you know, we have a lot of the same conversations, stuff that guys like to talk about, but it's easier, you know? 
[01:15:30]  You don't have to sit there beating around the bush for 20 minutes hoping some morons understand what you're talking about because you've got to talk in code 20 times removed from what you're actually talking about so you don't get in trouble.  Now we can just get on and blah, blah, blah.  And we don't have to worry about the bosses?  Yeah.  You know, after every show that we did in 2000, we would be called into some office or the phone would be ringing and blah.  Boys, that break was a little too long.  Well, no, not really because we were a talk show.  It was more like, I don't know. 
[01:16:00]  We like that our listeners can't hear us over the phone.  That's a big difference and we're very happy with it.  That they can't hear a word we're saying because it's so much better to talk and then have the listener talk right over what you're saying.  Fantastic.  That's a big difference.  Yeah, we're on vacation right now, but when we get back, guys, our faithful listeners, every phone call, because they're going to spend about, I think, about a million dollars fixed in our studio in New York City.  So when we get back live, we want all of you, when you get on the program, to say, guys, I still can't hear you. 
[01:16:30]  I still can't hear you.  It'll drive them nuts in Washington.  They're going to have like nuclear futuristic phones in this studio.  They're going to take two weeks and totally fix the studio.  Nothing should be broken.  Yeah, so make believe you still can't hear us.  It'll drive them nuts.  That's the main difference between Opie and Anthony 2000 and 2005 is the equipment here is now behaving like they predicted it would at Y2K.  Look at Jim all proud of himself.  Just proud that he got it out.  I know.  Let him say YK2. 
[01:17:00]  LOL.  It's been a long time since I've used that reference.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony on XM202 High Voltage.  Remember the time William Shatner called in?  My buddy Bill Shatner, as I like to call him, because his close friends call him Bill.  William is so, uh, it's too formal.  It's what rolls in the credits.  But when you're his pal, you can call him Bill Shatner, and that's what I called him.  And remember Jimmy and I tried to throw you under the bus? 
[01:17:30]  How could you, my hero, on the phone, and how could you try to throw me under the bus?  Well, Jimmy and I both knew that you're a huge fan of Shatner and Star Trek and stuff, so we decided, you know what?  Let's make believe that, uh, Anthony just doesn't really get the whole William Shatner thing.  I remember that.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thanks for, thanks for helping.  Man, I can't see why it's not called Norton Friends with that brilliant comment.  That was a good one.  I just, I, I confirmed what you said, and I did it quickly and concisely. 
[01:18:00]  All right, William Shatner called in the show.  This is how it sounded.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I thought William Shatner was calling today.  Hey, what time?  Between 9.15 and 9.30.  Really?  Do you have a CD out or something?  Yeah, he does.  Do we have any songs from it?  Yeah, we have, actually, it's a pretty good song.  Yes.  Let me go get it.  William Shatner has been.  Give me that back.  Produced and arranged by Ben Folds.  How about that?  Actually, the song is pretty good.  Rock Radio is playing it. 
[01:18:30]  Has been?  Mm-hmm.  That's the album.  It's about him?  Or is it like a sarcastic statement about, I wouldn't call him a has been.  He's still a very, very famous guy.  He's all over.  Every time you see him.  Boston Legal is incredibly funny.  Just saw him on VH1 did a whole 2004 thing.  Or was it Comedy Central?  I can never tell.  You can't call someone like that a has been.  The guy is like Americana as far as who he is.  You can't be a has been.  Well, usually he does like the Goop songs, Anthony, you know? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Do we have any of that stuff?  That was years and years and years ago.  He did that like spoken word stuff.  And he was serious when he did it.  Like now it's pretty funny.  Now he makes way if he wasn't serious.  Yeah.  And it's funny to have William Shatner talk on these songs.  But back then, that was all him.  Like really thinking this spoken word thing was going to be huge.  What's this called?  Which one is this?  Lucy in the Sky.  Going to his studio and have the singers do all this. 
[01:19:30]  And then Shatner.  So he didn't do this as a goof originally?  I thought he did.  No, he was dead serious.  Oh, because now he plays it off like he was a goof the whole time.  No, this is all serious.  All right, listen to William Shatner sing.  Very dramatic.  Very dramatic.  Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees.  And some marmalade skies.  Somebody calls you.  You answer quite slowly. 
[01:20:00]  A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  From Rigel 7.  Cellophane flowers of yellow and green towering over your head.  Like the gamesters of Triskelion.  A girl with a sun in her eyes.  And she's gone.  Oh, bad echo.  All right, so that's a sample of that song. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  We've got to play Mr. Tambourine Man.  That's the one where he's really going up.  Mr. Tambourine Man.  Mr. Tambourine Man.  More of William Shatner singing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bill Shatner is his friend's call.  I call him Bill Shatner.  If he calls in, I'm going to call him Bill Shatner like I'm his pal.  He ain't calling in.  Chuck Heston calling in too?  Chuck Heston?  Bobby De Niro?  Jimmy?  We'll add him to the list of people that didn't call in. 
[01:21:00]  Didn't call in?  Yeah.  Oh, Bob De Niro did SNL this week.  Yeah?  My friend got a picture with him.  Oh.  Dean.  There he goes.  Tambourine Man.  Tambourine Man.  Listen, listen.  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man. 
[01:21:30]  I just want to smoke hot when you hear this.  Take LSD.  Out of the village.  I'm not sleepy yet.  And there is no place I'm going to.  Ha, ha, ha.  It's back.  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.  Play a song for me.  Yeah.  In the jingle, jangle morning. 
[01:22:00]  I'll come following you.  Take me on a trip on your magic swirling ship.  Oh, my senses have been stripped.  My hands can't feel to grip.  My toes, too numb to step.  Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering, wandering. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man.  I guess you get the idea, right?  Yeah.  Gaston's love.  Okay.  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard.  Yeah, and he did it not as a goof.  It's not even fun.  It's not even interesting if it's going to be ironic.  Even then, it's not interesting.  He did that as a dramatic reading of these popular songs of the day and thought it was  going to take off, I guess.  Someone approaches him going, Bill, we love your acting style. 
[01:23:00]  Why don't you do a spoken word to these songs?  And he did.  You know, he has that delivery, that very slow and stick out.  Christopher Walken would be interesting to hear, or Nicholson seriously reading a song.  You think?  I would like to hear that.  Walken is not funny.  It would be pretty much just like what we just heard, I think.  Miss Tambourine Man, fire phasers.  Miss Tambourine Man, photon torpedoes. 
[01:23:30]  Anyone else notice that Big Kev is running around panicking and sweating?  Big Kev set up the William Shatner interview.  Oh, he's on the phone.  He's on the phone.  Yeah, look, guys.  They're talking about it on the radio.  Is Mr. Shatner awake yet?  Right.  I need Mr. Shatner on the phone now.  Tell him it's someone who looks like Bert Lahr.  No, I'll accept they sound alike at this point.  Just get me someone that sounds like Bert Lahr.  I need Shatner on the phone.  Warp drive.  Come on.  We're not stupid.  Can he beam him into the studio?  He's in a panic. 
[01:24:00]  He's trying to talk in a calm voice.  It's hello.  I had an interview with William Shatner.  Yes.  Yeah, you and the rest of the world.  Get in line.  His non-working nose is just flailing.  Mr. Shatner was scheduled to do an interview with Opie and Anthony.  Let's see what he says.  I'm wondering if...  Yeah, what is he saying?  With his tussleable hair.  What is he saying, Big Kev?  Is he out of the galaxy?  Why don't you admit that...  Uh-oh.  What does that mean you're working on it?  Who did you just call?  I'm working on it.  Who did you call?  I'm working on it.  He called Lieutenant Uhura, who is trying to locate Captain Kirk in his quarters. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, Kev, what seems to be the problem?  You know he's going to call in.  I hope to God you have a nice bib for all the crow that's going to spill out of your mouth when he calls in.  I'll get him.  I'll get him.  Hold on.  Anthony to Captain Kirk.  Anthony to Captain Kirk.  Please come to the studio.  No?  That didn't get him?  Maybe he's on the planet.  Hold on.  Energize. 
[01:25:00]  Is he beaming in?  No?  Damn, I'm trying everything I know to get him.  Open a hailing frequency.  Big Kev, you look a little uncomfortable and nervous.  Is it going to happen?  I'm afraid I'm going to be fired.  Fired from working for free.  I understand the joke, but is he calling or not?  No.  Is it 9.30 yet?  It's 9.25 and a half.  9.31 and then start breaking my balls.  All right.  All right.  Well, William Shatner off his has-been CD.  This is actually a good sounding song that, quote, regular rock radio is playing. 
[01:25:30]  I'm not sleepy and there's a station I ain't going to called XM.  Let's take a listen to this, okay?  All right.  Brand new William Shatner on the Opie and Anthony program.  She came from Greece.  She had a thirst for knowledge.  She studied sculpture at St. Martin's College.  That's where I caught her eye.  She told me that her dad was loaded. 
[01:26:00]  I said, in that case, I'll have a rum and Coca-Cola.  She said, fine.  And in 30 seconds' time, she said, I want to live like common people.  I want to do whatever common people do.  I want to sleep with common people.  I want to sleep with common people like you.  Well, what else could I do?  I said, I'll see what I can do.  I took her to a supermarket. 
[01:26:30]  I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere.  So it started there.  I said, pretend you've got no money.  She just laughed and said, oh, you're so funny.  I said, yeah.  Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here.  Are you sure?  You want to live like common people?  You want to see whatever common people see? 
[01:27:00]  Do we have to break into the song, Anthony?  We do.  Is this really William Shatner?  Hello?  Bill?  Hold on.  Is this really William Shatner?  Don't break into the song.  We'll just play it again.  I'll call back.  No, we'll just play it again.  We'll play it again after we speak to him.  That's crazy.  You've got to play that whole thing.  People have to know how good that record is.  We love it.  Mr. Shatner, I was telling everyone how great that song was. 
[01:27:30]  We really were.  You know, the Mr. Tambourine and the Lucy in the Sky.  Not really sure what to think of that.  I know you recorded it a long time ago.  But this common people thing is a really cool song.  Well, that's good.  The Tambourine Man stuff was part of another record called Transform Man, which they're re-releasing.  But it was all part of the Transform Man.  It was something that had to be listened to in its entirety. 
[01:28:00]  If you lift a song like Tambourine Man out of it, people have got to wonder, what in heaven's name is he doing?  And I think for the time it came out, didn't it take a little maybe, you know, a little pot or something to really get the full gist of it?  Well, that or a single malt.  But yes and no, I have mixed feelings about the Transform Man.  I haven't heard it in some times.  I don't know how good or bad it is. 
[01:28:30]  It's pretty bad, Bill.  It's pretty bad?  Yeah.  I think it's just become quite humorous.  Like, people play it, and they're not, like, really trying to get into it.  I think it's really kind of a laugh.  I disagree.  I like it.  Wait a minute.  Let me argue that point.  Sure.  Let me argue that point.  No problem.  Have you heard the whole record?  No, I never heard the whole record.  See, that's what I mean.  You're speaking from ignorance.  Yep.  I usually do.  Yeah, and it's a strident voice having no knowledge. 
[01:29:00]  You know what this is?  It's like I am a race that is so below you that I am like a mere bug in intelligence.  And maybe in years and years to come, I will be intelligent enough to be able to communicate with you.  Not if you don't do your research when you have all these millions of people that are listening to you and hanging on your every word.  I understand, Bill.  Wait a minute.  I've got to tell you, it's one of my favorite CDs.  I play it a lot.  Anthony just doesn't get it.  All right, Mr. Shatner, this is Jim Norton, and I'm a big fan, and I happen to enjoy it, too. 
[01:29:30]  And Anthony just refuses to listen to the whole thing, and I'm like, dude, you're not going to get it.  Tell me, just between us, what's the matter with Anthony?  I don't know.  I just, I found it funny, but I guess I've got to listen to the whole thing.  I told you that.  Yeah, we were trying to tell him for like 20 minutes, Mr. Shatner.  Better than that.  Bill, if I will.  Listen to one cut, but one whole cut, because it's a six-minute cut, rather than a three-minute cut.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a six-minute?  Well, it starts with literature and music underneath the literature and segues into a song. 
[01:30:00]  And my whole idea was trying to relate the literature of the past with the literature of the present and using music as a bridge.  Now, whether that works or not is something else, but not to play the whole thing is to do me a disservice.  And it's ignorant of him to, like, judge it only on that.  I'm sorry, Bill.  Judge it by having some knowledge.  I understand now completely.  Told you.  And I will listen to the entire cut.  And as we move forward, William, Bill, if I will. 
[01:30:30]  Moving forward.  All right, let's move forward.  What's the whole Has Been album about?  I've only heard common people so far.  The Has Been album, first of all, it would be a great gift in this late Christmas rush  to somebody who wanted to hear music about love and laughter and life and a piece of my heart.  Yes.  And there is a musical genius called Ben Foles who does some extraordinary work there. 
[01:31:00]  And the notices on the album of Has Been have been unlike anything I've ever been associated with.  Did Ben Sparks do?  Ben Foles.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Ben Foles.  Why the name Has Been?  Why is that title?  Well, I wrote the song Has Been because I saw it attached.  I saw the words attached to my name on my way to Nashville to record the album. 
[01:31:30]  How is that attached to your name?  They called me Has Been.  Now, who would do that?  You're still a pretty popular guy.  Still a...  No, no.  Take the word pretty out.  I'm no longer pretty.  You're a popular guy.  You're Americana.  You're a very popular guy.  Well, maybe.  You don't think you're still attractive to the females out there?  I'm sure you've got girls all over you all the time.  Yes, but they're over 65 and I don't think that counts.  Remember that poster of you when you were covered in triples? 
[01:32:00]  Chicks still feel like cream over that one.  I know, but we're talking about the past.  Yeah, I know.  It's the future.  You know, it happens.  Doesn't time just suck?  Yes, Bill?  You've got to understand, you're going to get old, too.  No, believe me.  I know.  No, we're not making fun of that.  I understand.  We think time is a major drag.  I just think that you're downplaying yourself because I'm sure a lot of girls are still very interested in Bill Shannon. 
[01:32:30]  Maybe, but if that's the judge of popularity, I suppose it is.  The point being, I wrote a song called Has Been and I thought it would be interesting, maybe amusing, to name the album that.  I think it works.  Yeah, I mean, you have to ask me why Has Been and that's good marketing.  Well, I had to ask because I didn't like the idea of you painting yourself in that light because you're not a has been. 
[01:33:00]  Well, if I weren't, then I'm not.  Right.  And if I am, then you wouldn't ask.  Now, how about your return to television, Bill?  On Sunday nights at Boston Legal.  On ABC at 7 at 10 o'clock.  I see a Shatner resurgence.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Now, this is your first full-time TV gig since when?  What was the last one you did?  Probably Rescue 911. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, we like the Rescue 911.  And T.J. Hooker?  And T.J. Hooker.  Yeah, I love that one, too.  Did you watch the show last night?  I don't think so.  No, we have to go to bed real early.  I know.  We do stupid morning radio, so it's a pain in the ass to watch stuff.  I've got to TiVo it, though.  But I...  Did you?  No, I did not watch last night's show.  So, Bill, he doesn't watch Boston Legal.  In actual fact, you guys have never seen Boston Legal.  Yeah, and it's just faking it for the interview. 
[01:34:00]  He's never seen Boston Legal in his life.  And I don't really appreciate him trying to kiss your ass, but I make him believe that he listens to Boston Legal.  I've got to say something here.  I don't want to get off on the wrong foot.  I think I'm getting off on the wrong foot with Bill Shatner here, because he's one of my, like...  I love this guy, and now these people are painting me as if I'm not quite the Bill Shatner fan.  As though you're a Nygdaramus.  Yes.  Well, you don't like his music.  You don't watch him on TV.  I watch him all the time, and I...  And say I'm pretty.  I watch...  Yeah, you're the one who said he's pretty popular. 
[01:34:30]  Not popular.  But the girls love him.  Yeah, but you know what I'm saying.  You did throw in that he was fairly and slightly popular.  No, I say he's huge.  And I'm having a resurgence from where?  Yeah.  Well, no, I mean...  He never went away.  Where did he say he went?  I meant on television.  I'm beginning to wonder whether this whole thing really isn't an insult.  No, yeah.  Anthony?  No, Bill, I'm a huge fan.  This is how you treat your heroes?  I bought every single Star Trek on DVD when it was put out in that goddamn set that you 
[01:35:00]  had to buy, like, two episodes per disc.  Really?  It was a pain in the ass, but I bought every one because I'm a huge Bill Shatner fan.  I bought all the movies.  You've been very disrespectful.  Why don't you just tell him you loved him when he hosted In Search Of?  You've been extremely rude since he called in.  No, that was Leonard Nimoy.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the way you're treating him.  You see Leonard around a lot?  He's a good friend of mine.  Yeah.  He's a great guy, too.  I see you in those Priceline commercials, and it's hysterical.  How do you know he's a great guy?  Yeah, exactly, you phony.  You know why?  Because it looks like you two really have a good relationship on those Priceline commercials. 
[01:35:30]  He might be a complete asshole.  And I'm just taking what I see from that.  Have you guys got a good relationship, or are you somewhat antagonistic?  We have a good relationship.  Do you see each other outside?  No.  No, we used to, but you know how it is.  No, how is it?  Do you really show up at his house nowadays?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Do you go to Leonard's house?  Do you go to Leonard's house for cocktails or a birthday party?  You don't, right? 
[01:36:00]  Cocktails.  Actually, we do.  He does.  Yeah?  I'm hopeful he's coming to my house for Monday Night Football.  And you talk about how bad the episode of Spock's Brain was?  No, we only tell each other how good we are.  Because that episode wasn't too good.  Spock's Brain.  Yeah, Spock's Brain.  Whenever that one comes on, I'm like, oh, that's Spock's Brain.  You see, it's that kind of detail I don't have in my fingertips.  Therefore, I don't talk about it.  You know what I mean, Anthony?  I hear you, Bill. 
[01:36:30]  I know.  You've moved on.  I know.  But you've got to admit, a lot of people are still very into Star Trek.  I guess they are.  And I think it's something you should be very proud of.  Well, I am.  I'm not...  I am proud of it.  What's the opposite of proud?  Ashamed.  I'm not ashamed.  Yeah?  For a moment there, my brain didn't work.  Any truths to the rumors of a return to Star Trek?  Yes, there's a great deal of truth.  Really?  Exactly which rumor are you? 
[01:37:00]  A return to Star Trek.  And who told you this rumor?  No, no.  It's something I read on the Internet.  Yes, well...  Are you a Star Trek geek?  I wouldn't believe everything you read on the Internet.  No?  He's a Star Trek geek, William.  Are you going to maybe be on an episode of Enterprise?  Well, not this year, but maybe they'll ask me next year.  They had asked me to be on, and I had suggested a price for my fee, and they suggested maybe I shouldn't be on.  Wow. 
[01:37:30]  Bill Shatner demanding the big bucks.  As well as he should.  Of course he should.  Because he's a legend.  You know what I saw the other day?  I saw that Twilight Zone episode, the one where...  Not the one everyone thinks of the man on the wing, but the one where you're in that little diner, and you're pulling out the little answer cards from the devil machine.  And you were...  Can you tell me why they keep playing that?  Can you tell me why they do that?  Because...  I don't understand it.  Because it's...  That stuff holds up, those old Star Trek episodes.  Why?  Because you're fantastic in it. 
[01:38:00]  No, no.  There's got to be some...  There's got to be something that appeals to people.  Some fear or some ability or something that appeals to people.  Yeah, I think those are just great stories, all those old Twilight Zones.  And your hair looks fantastic in it.  Say that again.  Who is that?  Sulu?  No, the guy.  I'm going to do a satellite radio network right now.  And I called you guys first to say thank you for playing the has-been and supporting the record. 
[01:38:30]  Are you trying to say you have to leave?  What town are you in?  No, no, no.  Oh, all right.  I don't.  But someone just came up to me.  I'm going to give you a little insight as to where I am.  I'm outside a parking structure in a car on a cell phone.  Oh.  And somebody came up to me and I thought, oh, Lord, he's going to ask me to move.  And I'm talking to you and I'm on the air.  Whereas he turned out to be the guy connected with the radio satellite tour that I'm going to do. 
[01:39:00]  You're not doing them all from inside the car, are you?  I'm what?  You're not doing all of the interviews from inside your car, are you?  No.  Of course not.  Only the better ones.  Now that was an insult.  No, not really.  I cannot convey to you what a big fan I am.  Have you played any other songs from Has Been on the air?  Well, I think we should start with playing Common People. 
[01:39:30]  The hit.  All right.  Common People has done a lot.  There's some good love songs there.  Yeah.  There's a terrific...  Brad Paisley sings a wonderful western country song.  Okay.  Why don't you try that one?  What song is it?  It's called Real.  Real.  I think it's the last song.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Real.  It's the last song on the album.  Bill, I saw you on the Comedy Central special.  How'd that go?  You were singing and dancing at the beginning, and it was fantastic. 
[01:40:00]  With seven.  Count them, seven.  Seven girls, and you totally held your own with the...  Are you patronizing him now?  I am not.  I thought he did a fantastic job.  I am probably the biggest Bill Shatner fan ever, and I'm honored to be on the phone with you.  Singing and dancing with pretty girls swirling around is where the whole showbiz thing is at.  You understand that.  I totally understand.  Everybody aspires to dancing on the stage with seven beautiful girls. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  I think that's the ultimate end of all showbiz.  I think you're right, Bill.  Singing and dancing with these long-legged beautiful girls, all tap dancing and kicking their heels, is really where it's at.  You are absolutely right.  I'm a huge fan.  I didn't want to get off on the wrong foot by Bill thinking I wasn't.  Well, I told you...  It's not that you're off on the wrong foot.  It's just that you're limping a little.  You're limping a little.  Do you like that he calls you Bill? 
[01:41:00]  It's okay.  I'll answer to that.  Well, you know, Mr. Shatner, I had told him many times that he had to listen to...  Bill is okay.  All right, Bill.  Bill is okay.  He had to listen to the whole album, and he just kind of refused, and he judged it very quickly,  and that just kind of bothered me that he wasn't given the original, the respect that he should have.  I mean, he really should, and the Transform Man is the parent of a has-been.  Yes.  If I hadn't made Transform Man, I wouldn't have made a has-been.  And no insult at all, Bill, but you do understand that people have looked at Transform Man, 
[01:41:30]  and over time it has now become something that's more humorous.  No.  They've looked at that one or two songs and mocked that, but they haven't mocked the album.  The album is used in schools to teach.  People have played the whole album.  Ben Folds, who we all agree is a musical genius, would not have made a has-been if it wasn't for the Transform Man, 
[01:42:00]  which he had heard years ago.  Joe Jackson, who sings Common People with me, heard the Transform Man years ago, wanted to be on this record.  Henry Rollins, same way.  Matt Chamberlain, who plays drums, genius percussionist, same thing.  So you're not taking that that Transform Man is a bit of a humorous thing?  No.  I didn't mean it to be humorous.  I meant it, well, humorous, yes, fun, entertaining. 
[01:42:30]  But I didn't mean it to be for Anthony to poke fun at it.  Yeah, because it is about literature and how it was and how it is in modern-day times.  Yeah.  I'm not poking fun.  I'm just saying that that's kind of how it's looked at, I guess, when it's taken out of context.  Anthony, we get it.  You don't like the album.  I told you you have to listen to the whole thing, and you're like, no, I just want to listen.  You can't just judge it by a little piece of the song.  Right.  How about his live performance of Rocket Man?  Was it Mike Douglas or Murph? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, jeez.  That goes on.  I mean, jeez.  Yeah.  That goes on.  That goes back so many years.  Why don't we talk about what he's doing today, Anthony?  I am, but I'm just bringing it up that that was kind of taken out of context, because  it was one song, and that's what people saw.  Exactly.  They asked me to sing a song, so for a gag, I sang a song like I thought Frank Sinatra  would sing the song.  With the cigarette and everything?  I'm a Rocket Man.  Yeah.  I loved that.  It was supposed to be amusing at the time, not 30 years later for people to...  You've got to give it credit. 
[01:43:30]  It's still amusing 30 years later.  There you go.  I bet you.  As long as I can bring a small, sad smile to your face.  Yeah.  All right.  A small, little, little smile, and the thought, what in heaven's name is he doing?  Thank you, Bill.  And actually, I ask the same question myself about twice a day.  What in heaven's name am I doing? 
[01:44:00]  Oh, you rock.  You rock, Mr. Shatner.  Yes.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling today.  We're going to play Common People from Has Been.  All right.  And then play real Brad Faisley, who is one of the number one Western country music singers.  You know what?  We'll give it a taste.  There's no problem with that.  And Joe Jackson is singing this song with you on Has Been Common People, right?  Exactly.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Thanks for calling in.  You have been and always will be my friend. 
[01:44:30]  That's your sentiment, not mine.  Oh, damn it.  Take it easy, Bill.  Bye, thank you.  Great talking to you, bud.  Right on.  There he goes, William Shatner.  I got dissed by Bill Shatner.  I apologize for piling on.  Oh, you threw me under the bus with my hero.  Oh, great.  Good.  Thank you, Bill Shatner.  And Big Kev, thank you.  Yes, Kev.  I told you he would do it.  Bravo.  Big Kev came through.  Good job.  I really did sell you.  I had no idea what he was talking about. 
[01:45:00]  I'm like, I told you, listen to the whole thing.  Left me out there hanging like a red shirt security guy, beamed down to a planet.  It was just so great when you're like, you meant that to be funny.  And then the, well, as soon as that semicolon after well came, I'm like, uh-huh.  You know, bastards.  All kidding aside, listen to Common People.  It's a really cool sounding song.  Yeah, it is.  It really is.  Save Ruth Bader.  He's going up to the big league.  The Boston Red Sox.  O&A return next week for a live broadcast from Boston.  It's still tough.  Come on.  Catch the virus at Bill's Bar before the Sox opener. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, and make sure you remove your eyes.  O&A.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony are overpaid.  But, you know, then again, so is, they are really lucky to have a job.  The worst of O&A.  Hi, Bob Kelly.  He's one of the Opie and Anthony virus freaks.  And they're coming to get him right now.  What's happening, man?  How do you feel O&A now on XM and totally uncensored, totally free? 
[01:46:00]  You're a stand-up comedian.  How does that let you loose here on O&A?  It's fantastic.  I'm so glad they're free.  Now, I just want to know, do I get my two bucks back for the last eight months?  But, yeah, it's fantastic.  It should be free.  More people get to listen to these two gentlemen, Opie and Anthony, get more fans, and then  they can take over the world.  I think that's their plan and be number one in the universe.  Why do you like being a part of the O&A show?  Because they have, they're the best fans in the world.  They have the best fans.  No, I'm just kidding. 
[01:46:30]  They don't.  Their fans are evil, atrocious creeps, but that's why I love them.  O&A, because they're the best.  They're the best.  You get to say what you want.  They're the funniest thing on the radio.  The absolute truth.  You get to say what you want about fucking a sink.  Where else could I tell people that I fucked a sink when I was in Juvie Hall?  What show will I be able to tell that on?  The Today Show?  No.  The FCC and censorship on the radio.  I think that satellite radio is the new cable, you know, like cable television, man.  You finally get to hear what people really think. 
[01:47:00]  And creeps like me get to get on the radio, finally.  There are going to be terrestrial radio shows I've done and had to talk about how my mother  used to hit me as a kid and I actually told one time, I told this story when I was in  Juvie Hall, I used to fuck a sink.  I get a lot of emails now about people and they got it all wrong.  They think I actually fucked the whole sink or actually fucked the drain of the sink, which  is physically impossible.  I actually just lied on top of the sink, put my hand on the edge of the sink, well lubricated, 
[01:47:30]  and then I pushed my mule inside of my hand.  And the sink, all it was, was leverage.  It was just leverage.  It was a place that I could put my hand where it would be sturdy enough.  I could just pump it.  Me pumping the hand instead of the hand pumping me.  So it's actually like you're having sex there and fucking the sink.  So please do it right.  I don't want people getting hurt trying to fuck the drain of a sink.  30 seconds.  Tell me about Opie and Anthony.  These two guys are actually breaking ground, making new radio, making history, along with 
[01:48:00]  Jim Norton.  They're actually saying how they feel about things instead of saying what they, other  people think they should say about stuff.  They're truth tellers.  They're prophets.  They're actually close to Jesus Christ of modern day age.  They give men what they want.  Boobs on the highway every Wednesday.  God bless them.  God bless Opie and Anthony.  Bob Scott, you're great.  Bob Scott, you motherfucker.  It's Bob Kelly.  I'd stab you right in the neck with my fucking pencil right now.  Bob Scott, you stink. 
[01:48:30]  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony on XM202.  High voltage.  Super.  No surprise that we like to run bits into the ground on the Opie and Anthony program.  I believe this is another Tony Danza call it.  Yes, it is.  But this is the one where it goes horribly wrong for our own Eric.  And I think this ended the bit.  Or did it?  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:49:00]  That's awful.  Why can't I do the scary laugh?  I just run out of hair.  Because you're making it one long sound.  You're going, muah.  And you sound like a fucking wildebeest.  Muah.  Muah.  It rubs lotion on its skin.  Muah.  It's the worst Opie and Anthony.  All right, a little surprise for everybody.  Haven't done this in a while.  No, we haven't. 
[01:49:30]  And we can't tell you what it is because we want to get it done before anyone gets in trouble, right?  We've done it in the past.  So let's go to Sex Bagel out on the streets of New York City.  Sex Bagel.  Hey, guys.  I'm out here in a cold, pouring rain with a bunch of Tony Danza fans here.  We have Tina from Philadelphia who is a massive Tony Danza fan.  She would love nothing more to speak to Tony.  Oh, that's wonderful.  All right.  I think Tony Danza is ready here. 
[01:50:00]  Hello?  Hello?  I think we're ready for Tina.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  Okay.  Here you go.  Hello?  Tina.  Hi, Tony.  How are you?  Hey, how you doing, Tina?  Good.  We love you so much.  There's eight of us.  You came all the way from Philadelphia to see you.  Philadelphia.  Hey. 
[01:50:30]  Hey, you know, I'm doing very well in Philadelphia.  That's great.  The show, it taking off.  Getting married.  I am so very excited.  I wanted to hear your CD.  I wanted to purchase one.  Oh, you like that?  Yes.  Yeah, well, I've loved singing for so many years.  And, you know, God bless.  I've been able to pursue that now and put out a CD.  Oh, that's great.  I was a big fan of Who's the Boss?  Oh, Who's the Boss?  And, of course, that other show I was on. 
[01:51:00]  But I still love you.  You're so haughty.  Oh, does that mean Tony might get lucky?  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.  Oh, you can't wait to come into the show.  Right.  And see.  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  Huh?  How do you think I'm doing as a talk show host?  You're doing good.  You're doing great.  Yeah, I don't look like a complete buffoon up there.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  You know, because I'm pretty stupid.  No, you're not.  But you're funny. 
[01:51:30]  You're funny.  It's a great show.  Hey, you watch the reruns of Taxi?  Huh?  You watch the reruns of Taxi?  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  When I was a young guy, you know, my mule was all hard.  Definitely.  And that little guy, the little guy, the little guy on Taxi.  The little guy on Taxi.  It was, um, the little guy on Taxi. 
[01:52:00]  The little guy on Taxi.  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Danny DeVito.  Good friend of mine, Danny DeVito.  Oh.  Yeah, he used to make us laugh so much.  He'd come in, and after a night out banging whores, he'd go, smell my finger.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  A little too risque, I understand.  But, uh, and then the, uh, you know, the, uh, the, uh, the guy that would, uh, that would fix the cars? 
[01:52:30]  Uh, uh.  Fix the cars.  Uh.  The guy with the cars.  Fix the cars.  Uh.  The guy.  The guy.  The guy.  Uh.  Lotka, Lotka.  Lotka.  Lotka.  Lotka.  Yeah, you know, I kind of forget.  I'm getting old in my old age.  Lotka, yes.  Lotka.  You know, he would, he would come in after banging whores and say, smell my mule.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great, though.  I'm so excited to see you. 
[01:53:00]  You know, it's like Dr. Phil says.  You know, when you give something up, you gotta replace it with something else.  Right.  You know, you understand that, right?  Oh, I completely understand it.  Yeah, huh?  So, uh, how long before they let you in?  I don't know.  We're still waiting.  Hey, do you know who's on the show today?  No.  Uh-oh.  I was hoping you'd tell me.  Because I, I, they don't tell me until the last minute.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we all know who's on the show today. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, how big of a Tony Danza fan are you?  I'm a big fan.  A big, big fan?  I'm a huge fan.  We're all huge fans.  We have eight people.  Yeah.  Um, what's got your CD?  Excuse me?  Could you give me a CD?  I will personally give you a CD after the show.  As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, if you, uh, let my, uh, my person on the scene  there, Eric, know, uh, where you're sitting, uh, how would you, how would you like to come 
[01:54:00]  backstage after the show and, uh, hang out with Tony?  I would love it.  I have, I have eight people with me.  Can they come too?  They could all come backstage.  That would be awesome.  But, you know, there's a little, a little trade-off here, you know, a little trade-off.  I do for you.  You do for Tony Danza.  All right.  Uh, do you understand?  I completely understand.  We love him.  Hello? 
[01:54:30]  Here we go again.  Hello?  Do you, do you know the kind of favor Tony needs?  You know, it's, it's pretty, uh, a lot of high pressure, uh, doing a show, uh, every  day like this.  You, you understand?  I, I completely understand.  And, uh, I need to relax a little bit.  You know, I need to relax.  I used to have to relax on a set of taxi and who's the boss.  And, uh, there were people that would help, uh, me relax.  Maybe you could help me relax a little bit is what I'm saying. 
[01:55:00]  I'll, I'll help you relax.  You know, maybe a little back rub.  Definitely.  You, would you like to give me a back rub?  I sure will.  Hey, maybe a little front rub.  Oh my God.  Are you married?  Yeah, I'm getting married in March.  Yeah, well, I'll try to put a stop to that, huh?  Hey, you keep your husband happy, huh?  Yes, definitely.  Hey, you want to do me a favor?  Sure. 
[01:55:30]  When I'm doing my, uh, my monologue at the beginning of the show,  Uh-huh.  Would you come up on stage and give me a kiss?  Oh, I sure will.  I would love it.  You know, I'm starting a new segment on, on the program.  And I like having a, uh, a lovely young lady, uh, come out on stage and give me a little  peck on the cheek.  I would be honored to.  I would definitely be honored to.  Now, uh, we, we need a good, a good time, uh, for you to come out. 
[01:56:00]  Okay.  And give me that little kiss on the cheek.  Okay, definitely.  Now, as soon as I walk out.  Okay.  I'll walk out on the stage.  Okay.  And I want you to, you know, the, uh, the audience is applauding because I'm, uh, Tony Danza.  Uh-huh.  And you, uh, you come out.  Really?  And, uh, I'll be like, oh, here's someone from the crowd.  And just, uh, say, I love you, Tony.  And give me a kiss on the cheek.  Oh, that'd be awesome.  And then you go back to your seat and I'll give you a CD and you come back and give me a massage. 
[01:56:30]  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  I'm so excited.  And so am I.  Thank you.  I won't ruin it by saying anything else.  All right.  I look forward to seeing you on stage at the beginning of the show.  I sure will.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you very much.  God bless.  Thank you very much.  God bless you too.  Bye-bye.  Hey, guys.  Eric.  Hey, um, we have the head of security here.  He's right next to me.  He wants to confirm that, uh, we're, this isn't the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:57:00]  Do you know that it's really Z-100?  Um, yeah, sure.  Okay.  Hang on one second.  All right.  Uh, we have somebody from the company who wants to, if you want to confirm it.  Oh, what happened there?  Uh-oh.  Well, it sounds like somebody's onto this shenanigan.  I knew it.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Someone from the show knows the deal now. 
[01:57:30]  That stinks.  Aw.  Well, I'm still going to have to watch today, and hopefully they won't talk to that woman.  Yeah, they'll talk right to her.  Do you think?  Yeah.  This is another will get it done.  I don't know.  Maybe, maybe Eric, uh, kept her away from, uh, the girl I was talking to.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Boy, they always think it's Tony.  They're so happy to talk to that big, dumb bastard.  Your impression's phenomenal, though.  I think it's Tony, and I'm looking at you.  Big, dumb ass.  Eric's all nervous. 
[01:58:00]  He's down there in his fake Tony Danza t-shirt.  Is he wearing a fake Tony Danza t-shirt?  Yeah, he went down there with it.  We actually had t-shirts made up.  Let's say Tony Danza show staff.  Yeah.  We got, like, Tony Danza's staff t-shirt, a jacket, a hat.  We go all out for our bits.  We do it enough.  One of these days, it's going to happen.  They're probably making an announcement before the show.  If Tony spoke with you, look, if Tony Danza spoke with you on the phone, don't come running 
[01:58:30]  out on the stage, okay?  You fucking roon.  Come out and give me a kiss on my cock.  Duh.  Oh, wow.  She was very happy to talk with Tony.  May have to just be vicious from now on, then.  If it's never going to get on stage, you may just have to keep smashing them with filth.  I know.  You know what's really funny?  She doesn't...  I'm talking to her, and I bring up that Dr. Phil said, you know, if you give something 
[01:59:00]  up, you've got to replace it with something.  You understand?  And she's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, she's just so thrilled to talk with this idiot that she doesn't care what he's  saying.  She's just agreeing with it.  She's agreeing with anything.  We're trying to get Eric back on the line, but...  Where'd he go?  Ben's laughing.  Ben, you can come back in.  The boss thing's over.  Jesus.  Why is Ben cackling?  I don't know, but he's got something to say.  He's in an outbreak suit, Ben.  He's just afraid.  He's being...  They're threatening to arrest him.  What? 
[01:59:30]  Disorderly conduct.  How is that disorderly conduct?  He's the most disorderly guy ever.  Then they grabbed his phone or something.  They grabbed his phone.  Grabbed his phone.  What?  Is this going to be the first person arrested on the new Opie and Anthony show?  Eric.  Why can't I fucking do it?  Hey, what's up, Eric?  Yeah, they're not letting me leave.  They're threatening to arrest me here for disordinary contact and ruining their show.  Eric, run away.  They're not cops.  Leave right now. 
[02:00:00]  Run.  Hello?  Oh, they got him again.  Just run away.  He's got to just run.  They don't understand.  People don't understand.  If they're not cops, you can flee.  Yeah.  Run away.  Oh, Eric's going to get arrested now.  Eric's going to get arrested because he's not running away.  Like stupid Mercurio.  Run away.  Run.  Run.  They're not cops.  You can run from Danza security.  They're not going to put an APB.  Hey, call in all cars.  Call in all cars. 
[02:00:30]  Look for a cute little chubby boy with frosted hair.  Car 54, where are you?  It's the Danza police.  The Danza police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Are you kidding me?  I thought we were pretty sneaky today.  They've been just waiting for us, huh?  Pull over.  Who's the boss?  I'm the boss.  Don't make a move.  Drop the cell phone.  Well, someone has to get down there.  Oh, he's got to run. 
[02:01:00]  I'll give Ben all the numbers for the record label guy.  So I'll go down there.  Well, uh...  Disturb...  What is it?  Disorderly conduct?  That was the most orderly call ever.  Danny's good.  Danny, go run down there with a cell phone.  Don't get caught and tell us what the hell's going on.  Because they took us...  Oh, wait.  Is he back?  Who's this?  Hey, it's Eric.  All right, what's going on?  The guy keeps smacking the phone out of my hand and closing it.  He's like, I don't give a fuck who you're talking to.  He's like, if you...  And he's sitting here trying to take a picture and everything.  Just walk away, stupid. 
[02:01:30]  I'm not...  I've been trying to, but the guy won't let me fucking keep you getting me, girl.  What, is he holding on to you?  Yeah!  He's not allowed to hold you.  That's assault.  Punch him in the face.  Punch him in the friggin' nuts.  I have an idea for you.  I said, no, I just took a cab here.  And he said, well, how would you want to bet if I go through you, you got a lot?  I said, you can't go through me.  I don't know who the fuck you are.  You're not a cop.  He's not a cop.  Run away.  I'm trying to.  Break loose and run.  Break loose.  Break loose.  Use one of those... 
[02:02:00]  Unbelievable.  He was a master phone.  Data security can't tell him not to be on the phone.  Oh, you're right.  Or they can't.  And you can talk to anybody online.  Is our guy going to get arrested with a fake Tony Danza?  You can talk to anybody online with a fake Tony Danza.  You don't want to be at the tombs with a Tony Danza show t-shirt on.  All right, well...  Hey, my thoughts and prayers are with Eric.  Danny can handle this, because we need you for the next segment.  Can Danny handle this, though, or should Steve go?  No, Danny can handle this.  He's good.  Just tell Danny to run there with the phone. 
[02:02:30]  All right.  All right?  I got Steve's strategy.  Steve will go there.  They'll be upset.  Pull the fire alarms, because they'll see a blaze, and he'll be able to make good his  escape.  Yeah, you weren't in Chicago overnight, were you?  No.  No, sorry.  Saw some of your clothes flying out a window.  Doing a little office work at night, were you?  How can this head of security smack his phone?  Who the fuck is this guy?  Tony Danza's security.  He's a bully.  That's all he is.  He's intimidating.  I mean, he's probably...  He's this huge...  I bet you he's a huge black guy that just...  Thinks he can intimidate the shit out of Eric, and Eric's scared. 
[02:03:00]  Wow.  Send Master Poe.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  We really should.  We should send Poe down there.  Send Poe down there.  Oh.  Spin kick the sun.  Go in and just kick ass on the Danza set.  No, but you know what?  If Eric is going to be hassled physically, you can't have that.  It can't happen to him.  No.  The guy could be arrested for assault right there, just holding him.  Yeah, you could just grab him.  Just grabbing him.  He could be knocking the cell phone out of his...  Absolutely not.  You'd rather go online and interview or talk to anybody you want.  Absolutely.  There's no security guy on a sidewalk.  Well, what is...  You can better somebody get Billy Mac or one of those guys on the phone.  Billy Mac. 
[02:03:30]  He's Billy Mac.  Master Poe.  What's wrong?  Eric's in trouble?  Yeah, one of our guys is in trouble.  Yeah.  No bullshit.  He's online with Tony Ganda thing.  He's getting arrested.  The head of security won't...  He was just on the phone.  He wasn't doing anything.  And the head of security is like...  Like every time he tried to call the show, the head of security won't let him go.  And he keeps smacking his phone.  What exactly did he do?  On the phone.  Just with the phone.  Like interviewing somebody on the line.  Okay.  This just in?  He got away?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, good. 
[02:04:00]  Of course.  Is he running?  Yeah, he's running.  I just told him I'm running in the middle of traffic.  That's how he's running.  You could lose him.  What did they do to him?  Oh, I don't know.  Nothing.  Now you're right away.  They knocked the cell phone out of his hand.  Right?  We'll get the phone.  Or when Eric gets back here.  We're getting in contact with Keith.  You can't do that.  Bodily holding him.  No, you can't do that.  That's against the law.  You can't smack anything out of anyone.  When Sex Bagel gets back, we'll find out exactly what happened.  Dude, I really think that if he smacked the phone out of his hand, Eric should file a report.  Exactly.  There's nothing illegal about interviewing somebody on a line. 
[02:04:30]  Of course not.  Why?  Do we have to deal with cops again?  Twice already?  It's not against the law.  No.  Eric's not a disorderly guy.  It's not against the law.  Maybe he can get free tickets for Tony.  And he's a nice guy.  He did nothing.  Oh, my God.  Master Poe's going to lose his mind.  Look at him.  Breathe.  He's taking the legal road.  Breathe.  Thoughts and prayers, Poe.  Breathe.  We've got to get some boards in here that you can break when you just get pissed off.  We should contact Keith, because honestly...  Well, we'll find out.  As soon as Eric gets here.  That's wrong.  Yeah, it's wrong.  I hope he's ditching the Tony Danza t-shirt where Master Poe ditched the bloody gi. 
[02:05:00]  The bloody gi in that dumpster.  That'd work.  It's the evidence.  Eric, if you're listening to us,  ditched the evidence.  How is he listening to you?  He doesn't have...  He hasn't lost his ear.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, we'll find out what happens when he gets here, okay?  Okay.  All right, Poe.  Breathe.  Breathe for us, okay?  Poe's very pissed off right now.  Eric running down the street.  Your mom's mom!  All right.  He got the word in.  Great.  Man, they've been waiting for us.  We've been wondering.  We were being set up. 
[02:05:30]  We were being lulled into a false sense of security.  You heard how sneaky we were.  We didn't tell anyone.  We just went to it real fast.  He's there with the dopey shirt on.  You know that pissed them off.  Too bad.  It's not illegal.  You can wear whatever the hell you want.  It says the Tony Danza show.  But why'd they ask if you were the other radio station?  I guess it's okay if Z100 does it, but not us.  Because Z100 isn't going to say things like Tony needs his cock sucked.  I think it might have been, from what I was gathering there, they think Eric was saying  he was with the Opie and Anthony show, but he was really with Z100, so they wanted to 
[02:06:00]  know who was really at the bottom of this so they could get them in trouble.  So they were trying to get Z100 in trouble, thinking it was Z100.  That's what I think.  There you go.  I don't think they have a relationship with the Z100.  I think they thought Eric was lying and saying it was Opie and Anthony.  I think Eric panicked and said, I'm with Z100.  Oh, you think Eric did that?  Of course he did.  Or a misrepresentation of himself?  Would you say you were with Opie and Anthony on the line?  He probably just went, who are you here with? 
[02:06:30]  You know, some douchebag.  Oh, Z100 guy.  Yeah, he does do that to get out of trouble.  Oh, yeah, and he figures out what's the faggiest radio station, so maybe he'll have some sympathy  for me.  Hey, man, this is Tommy Chong, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Boy, how bad can it get?  All right, so Anthony, wow.  Eric is on his way back to the station.  Yeah.  He had a call up twice for us to tell him to run, though, which gets me...  I'm going to have a briefing with some of these people, Opie, because the prime rule for 
[02:07:00]  anyone out and about that is involved with this show on the street ever, ever, ever...  Is to make sure you get arrested so we get the publicity?  Well, yeah, that's the real thing, but the official line, we tell them, is to run!  Or just walk away fast.  They can't grab you for something like that.  No, but apparently the security guard at the Tony Danza show grabbed Eric and was holding  him, saying that the cops had been called, and that he was holding him there, bodily,  and that would grab his cell phone or smack his cell phone out of his hand. 
[02:07:30]  This constitutes assault, Opie.  Now, here's the problem.  If the cops were called, then the cops will be here, because now they have to get to the  bottom of it.  Good, let them.  Eric can call whoever he wants.  Do you think New York's finest is going to take the time out to come down here after  they talk to a Danza security guard and find out that nothing was happening?  Danny.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Danny.  I just got to the line.  There's no sign of Eric, but there is a big BP security guard I could probably talk 
[02:08:00]  about, too.  All right, yeah, ask him where Eric went.  All right, hold on.  Wait, we're kicking our internet.  Wait, wait, Danny.  Yeah.  Should we do that?  He just wants to ask him, but maybe we should hear from Eric first.  Yeah, why don't you just ask the security guard what happened to the Eric guy?  The guy from G100?  The guy from the...  Hey, was there a guy here named Eric?  No.  Well, I'm looking for him.  I don't see him.  I was just wondering if you might know where he is. 
[02:08:30]  He was interviewing the Tony Danza audience member.  He has no idea where Eric might be.  All right.  I wonder if that's the same guy.  Yeah, I don't know.  It could be a different guy.  Okay.  I'm peeking into the windows looking for him inside.  No, Danny, Eric ran away.  Oh, he did run away?  Yeah, he ran away.  He made like a banana and split.  Yes.  All right, cool.  All right, thank you.  He ran like Bobby De Niro from a Norton photo op.  Oh, God, that hurts.  Thank you, Chief Shee from New York. 
[02:09:00]  Did he say that?  Yes.  I'm not going to say that.  Call up Eric.  I want to see where he is.  We want to...  Ben, Ope wants Eric on the phone.  Get all the details.  Yeah.  So, we've been doing this Tony Danza thing off and on for...  Well, I guess that's only the third time, right?  Yeah, that's only the third.  Is my mic lower again?  I don't know.  Eric ran, man.  Somebody held Steve's hat under his ass.  There we go.  Yeah, from time to time, we go out to the Tony Danza line as they're filing in to see  that stupid show.  And Anthony does a great Tony Danza impression. 
[02:09:30]  And we have a little fun with it.  And we have fun with the rubes that are waiting to see Tony Danza.  Because they're all rubes on that line.  And they buy it every single time.  Every single time.  All happy to talk to Tony.  We haven't been tripped up once.  Do we have, like, the other one all queued up?  Maybe we can play this and by the time this ends, Eric will be in studio.  How does that sound?  This was the dirty one.  This is the dirty version?  Yeah, this is pretty funny, though.  So, you know, finally today they were on to us and they caught us.  And I don't know what's going to happen.  Because they were trying to hold Eric there, the security guard. 
[02:10:00]  And supposedly the cops were called.  I bet they had a big meeting about this a while back.  And they were all psyched that it was happening today.  Probably on the walkie-talkies.  It's going down.  It's going down on the line.  He's out there.  He's out there.  Code blue.  Code blue.  He's on the line.  Big meeting.  All right.  If it happens again, I want some fucking heads busted.  Yeah, you know how he...  Like Dan's in there with a baseball bat.  I guarantee that's how he talks when he's not on his show.  These fucking pricks fuck with my show again. 
[02:10:30]  I want some blood on that fucking sidewalk.  You hear me?  I ain't the nice fucking Dan's in here today, pal.  It's all nasty.  Like when they take the guy back at the casino and he's been cheating.  Oh, in The Cooler?  What was that?  No, no.  I think...  What movie was that?  Casino.  Casino.  And they take the guys that were cheating.  Oh, my God.  In the back.  You could have the money or your hand.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was also in The Cooler.  Yeah, they had a scene like that.  It was?  Yeah, but your casino's bigger.  It's Tony Danza. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, why don't you come back here, huh?  You don't fuck with Danza.  I'll give you the fucking Danza.  No thoughts and prayers to this scumbag.  Thoughts and prayers to your face.  So, Eric, what happened?  We were convinced we were going to get away with it again.  Yeah.  Well, you did to an extent, but as soon as she handed the phone back to me, I turn around  and there's this guy right there.  And he starts going, who are you?  Who are you working for?  I didn't give him a name or who I was working for, right? 
[02:11:30]  So, as I said on the phone, I'm like, this guy wants proof that I'm with, and I said  another company.  Of course.  All right, and he said, and then he takes the phone out of my hand and he closes the  phone like this.  Just slaps it down and gets in my face.  Then he pulls me by my left shoulder here.  So, he did put his hands on you.  He pulled my shoulder, pulled me just, I mean, it wasn't like vicious.  That's all you need.  But it was about a foot away from where the line is, where everybody is.  It's assault.  And he gets right in my face and he goes, I can have you arrested for disorderly contact,  disrupting the show. 
[02:12:00]  And he's going through all this other stuff.  I said, I'm on a public sidewalk with a cell phone talking to another person.  So, he's just getting right in my face and these two other guys come out from the building,  look like cops but not really cops kind of thing.  Dan's a security.  Yeah.  So, they come out there and they're standing there and they've got a list.  They've had some paper in their hand and they're going over the thing.  And I gave them a fake name and they're just shaking their heads because that name's not  on the list.  I guess they researched the show.  They have a list of everyone involved with this program.  He was trying to get me to say I was with Opie and Anthony. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  He was trying.  And I was saying, I'm not with them.  I said, there's another company.  What was this list?  What was in like the book?  I couldn't see them.  They wouldn't show it to me.  But they had it.  They're going down this list here.  I saw a white piece of paper.  It's probably a list with all our faces and our names and all that.  Great.  Saying we've had nothing but problems from this show.  We don't want these people out there.  We've been instructed to get rid of these people or do whatever is necessary to get  rid of these people.  Whatever is necessary.  That's Tony Danza.  Assaulting.  Behind the scenes, probably.  Assaulting our staff on a public sidewalk. 
[02:13:00]  What happened with the phone?  You kept calling in.  The phone kept calling Dan.  The guy kept shutting the phone.  How was he going to do that without touching you?  All right.  At this point, when he pulls me aside and he's telling me, no, you cannot do that, right?  The first time he closes the phone and he's yelling at me, Ben calls.  So I open the phone again.  I'm talking to Ben from maybe...  And he's holding on to you at this point?  No, he let me go.  He just pulled me one quick second away from the line and then let me go.  He wasn't still holding me.  Was he pulling you on your Tony Danza t-shirt?  No, I hit that real quick.  Oh, you hit?  I had the jacket right up there buttoned. 
[02:13:30]  I was like, he's not seeing that shirt.  You pussy.  Hey, we're all on the same team.  We all work for Tony.  So I'm standing on the sidewalk there, right?  Ben calls.  I talk to Ben maybe three to five seconds.  All of a sudden, out of my hand again.  Click.  He's got my phone now.  He took my phone.  He took the phone out of your hand.  Open my phone and starts hitting buttons trying to see what's in the phone.  He's trying to find out where my phone book is on the phone, trying to find who I just dialed and all that. 
[02:14:00]  Columbo, knock it off.  How much, this guy wants so bad to be some type of cop.  A cop, yep.  He's one of them.  He's, now this is his big chance with his book with our names in it and grabbing the phone and trying to get numbers out of your phone.  That's invasion of privacy.  So as soon as he's doing that, I take the phone back and I close it, right?  I said, what are you doing?  And he said, let me see some ID.  I said, I don't have ID. 
[02:14:30]  I took a cab here.  And I don't have to show you.  He goes, how much you want to bet if I go through your pockets right now, I find a wallet?  And he's pointing to my left side here, which is my keys and my other phone.  Big lump.  And I said, those are keys.  And I said, and you're not searching me.  Now this time, I realized I'm standing at the edge of the curb, so I walk into the street.  Now I'm in the street.  He comes right to the edge, but he won't walk into the street.  And he's still yelling at me, the two other guys.  Doesn't matter.  The sidewalk or the street, it's not.  I know.  But Ben just goes, run into traffic.  So I'm trying to get into traffic. 
[02:15:00]  You're going to be a fine parent, Ben.  Yes.  So I'm trying to get into traffic.  There's cars coming, so I'm stuck between that little gap of the street and the actual traffic.  And those other guys are blocking me, so I can't move anywhere.  And then I'm trying to get on the phone again, and the phone just, the last time it crapped out.  There you go.  There you go.  Running across the street.  Just run into traffic. 
[02:15:30]  What's all that racket outside?  I'm trying to do a show.  I've got to be honest.  I don't think there's anything illegal about you being out there talking to people.  There isn't.  No.  And I think that a public sidewalk, we might have to call and say, look, this guy grabbed  you.  He's shutting your phone.  That can't happen.  He grabbed you.  I don't care if he just pulled me a foot.  That's assault.  He kept taking your phone and shut it.  You can't touch somebody else's shit.  And he started going through the phone.  Property is also another charge.  So what was going on with the lady that you talked to?  She was cool. 
[02:16:00]  There was like a party of eight from Philadelphia.  It was like grandmothers, granddaughters, and regular daughters.  There was a whole big family affair because one of them was getting married next week.  So they came up to go to the Tony Danza show.  And they were all excited.  They were having a blast talking on the phone.  They were all sitting there, Danny DeVito.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're all here.  And they're trying to come up with the names of the people that Tony couldn't remember.  And one of the older ladies is tapping around.  He's like, he's got a CD.  Get a CD.  And she goes, oh, yeah.  Can we get a CD?  And of course Tony said yes.  Of course.  A good egg.  What a good guy. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, one of the other things he told me, too.  And he goes, I guess you said, give Tony a kiss on the cheek.  That's how you get in favor with Tony.  And he starts listing these other things, which were never said.  But I didn't hear the phone call, so I don't know.  So I was like, I said, dude, I was standing right next to you.  I did not hear that phone call.  Were they listening?  They might have an XM there.  They have an XM in there.  I guess they like the Open Anthony show.  And the security, probably their job, when that line is out there, to listen to this program. 
[02:17:00]  Well, I did a contest with those guys, too, for a free XM.  Go home.  Just go home.  Jesus.  Just go home.  Can you give me a coffee while you're out there looking for a rope?  Yeah.  Please go home.  Just go.  Walk away.  Play the Hulk music.  Do something.  Get them out of here.  They can't ask you for ID or anything.  You're not running into the building causing it.  You're on a phone.  Yeah.  I didn't give him a thing.  Didn't tell him my name.  Didn't tell him who I worked for.  You took your pinch like a man.  You didn't write.  That's right.  Ah, De Niro again.  Ah.  We can't tell him anymore. 
[02:17:30]  Well, Master Poe is pacing like a mother hen.  Yeah, he's freaking out.  He was human.  He's positioning me outside.  Now, how did he come at you?  What angle?  How did he come at you?  How did he come at you?  That's the real deal.  Master Poe, share the mic with Eric.  Yeah, okay, that was assault, and we should call the cops right now.  That is assault.  Right now.  You were assaulted on a public sidewalk by some stupid security guard.  Well, Master Poe, that's your call, obviously.  You know, Master Poe is very pissed off because he looks on a bus who protects us.  He's like a mother hen.  One of these ducklings. 
[02:18:00]  If that guy grabs you like that, you would have taken that as an assault.  You would have taken and reacted as an assault.  Well, by law, you're not supposed to grab someone, and if someone is attacking you or  if someone is actually trying to grab you, immediately you can defend yourself, so it's  self-defense.  And in his case, I don't know what the guy looks like or what skills he has.  It doesn't matter.  He's supposed to be a professional.  You can't put your hands on anybody.  It doesn't even matter how it is.  If you put your hand on someone's back, like you want to ask him a question, and you 
[02:18:30]  put your hand on his back, once the hand touches somebody, you can be charged with  assault if that person wants to charge.  Like an umpire back in, like Earl Weaver, he used to turn his hat around, because if  your hat touches the umpire, you were thrown out of the game.  Right.  Any type of contact.  Plus, I believe it's also a robbery, because he grabbed the phone out of his hands.  There's something else there.  Absolutely.  I'm not a police officer.  Let's get all the police officers out there to call.  I don't want to tie up emergency lines with that, but we should call a precinct and  do something about that.  You haven't talked to. 
[02:19:00]  I think they need a talking to.  We've got an expert on the line.  Perhaps a bit more.  Keep the cop.  What's up?  Good morning.  I just got a call from Clubby.  He needs to be corrected.  Everything okay?  Hey, Ben.  Our boy Sex Bagel was roughed up a little bit outside the Tony Danza show.  He was assaulted by a Tony Danza security guard.  What do we have here?  What are the facts?  The facts are Eric was on the sidewalk while the line was going into the Tony Danza show.  He gave a woman that was online the telephone, and she got to speak with Tony Danza. 
[02:19:30]  And Eric might have been impersonating a worker from the Tony Danza show.  Right.  An employee.  Yeah.  So after the phone call is done, Eric takes the phone back.  A security guard for the Danza show, I believe, comes up to Eric and grabbed him by his shoulder  and pulled him over to him and started telling him how he wasn't allowed to do that, how it was disorderly conduct, disruption of the show, 
[02:20:00]  all kinds of stuff that could get him, he thought could get him in trouble.  But the fact of the matter is, the only person that did anything wrong was a security guard by touching Eric.  And he kept taking his phone.  Eric's trying to call the show.  The guy keeps snatching his phone.  And the guy snatched the phone out of Eric's hand and started going through his phone book trying to find numbers in there.  After that, Eric just finally got away from the guy and ran back to the studio.  Okay.  All right.  So now we want to, you know, maybe somebody can go over there and speak with the security guard 
[02:20:30]  because I think Eric feels that charges should be filed for assault.  Well, I wouldn't say it's an assault.  I'm going to have to say it's more of a harassment.  Yes.  But this is the angle I'm going to work on this whole thing, and it might work for us.  If we can get Tony Danza to staple his ball bag to his leg,  I think we can get Tony Danza about a million and a half in bail.  You ass.  Why isn't that assault? 
[02:21:00]  Because in the statutes of the law of harassment, it's push, shove, kick, punch.  It really doesn't go further than that.  We're kind of sounding faggy is what you're saying, huh?  Well, no, but harassment is still good, though.  It's still something.  That's a good one.  It is something.  He can't just do that.  He can't just snatch his phone and go through it on a public sidewalk.  We want to teach these talk show line security people that they can't get away with this kind of stuff.  Brown shirts.  Well, you know, I mean, he was talking to Tony. 
[02:21:30]  She was talking to Tony.  I don't know what this guy's problem is.  I know.  She was very happy.  We're making people on the line happy.  That's kind of, you know, out of line.  But, yeah, harassment.  Maybe I could work something with snatching the phone out of his hand.  Yeah.  I don't know how happy they would be over at the precinct.  But, you know, listen, this is a violation of his rights, and it's not.  We just want to know if we could violate someone with a billy club.  That's all we need to know, Keith.  Right.  Can we drag someone down to the precinct and give them the business in the men's bathroom?  We might be able to work something along those lines. 
[02:22:00]  If you can't find anyone, I'll play the part of the prisoner.  Did Ovi say mother hen and baby ducklings?  You guys let me slide on that one.  Not the audience.  I know.  Killer Kitten's like mother hen and baby duckling.  Why not just say elephant with a baby cub, jackass?  That's another time where I start sweating going, oh, please.  They didn't hear that, did they?  The audience catches everything.  All right.  You're ratting me out, Killer Kitten.  Thanks.  Now, what do we do?  We want this guy brought up.  I think after the show. 
[02:22:30]  We're going to just go for street justice.  Well, if we don't go over the street justice, how about after the show, I'll talk to Eric  and we'll see what we can come up with.  Let's do that.  I'll make a couple phone calls.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  A lot of people are calling us a bunch of faggots on the instant feedback.  Why?  They're like, shut up, Sol.  They want to know if Sex Bagel was very injured.  Eric was very injured.  He grabbed me and I was hurt.  Were you physically hurt?  Well, my feelings were very hurt. 
[02:23:00]  And I felt ashamed.  I was standing on the sidewalk and he pushed me and took my phone.  He went through my phone book and realized I have no friends and pointed that out to me.  I was very embarrassed.  He was hurtful.  I just think that if I did get the call and I showed up and Eric told me that he was working  the line to see if any ladies wanted to lick Tony's mule. 
[02:23:30]  And then the security guy pushed me.  It's a little hard to write up in the report.  You know, but I'm going to try and work an angle.  All right.  It's a radio show doing an on-the-street interview.  That's right.  That's pretty much what it was.  Can't touch him.  No.  I have one question.  Yes, Master Poe.  Hey, Keith, isn't there a progression when it comes to, this is for the listeners out  there, because they're saying that, you know, Eric is a wimp, the way he responded or the  way that we're responding. 
[02:24:00]  I think Poe's saying that, Eric.  No, no, no.  No, no, I'm not.  Actually, there's a progression.  If someone is coming at you verbally, that's step number one.  Then they're going to come at you physically.  And in this case, he grabbed him.  All right.  So after that, he's going to throw a punch and hit him in the face.  Yes.  Come on.  You have to draw the line somewhere.  What country are we living in?  Russia.  I mean, where are we?  Where are we?  Canada.  Freedom.  No, I personally think that it was wrong for him to do that.  And that wasn't professional. 
[02:24:30]  It's just that, you know, how wrong was it?  I mean, you know, in the eyes of the law.  Gotcha.  I don't think it's a felony, but I do think that maybe the security guard needs a talking  to, because this way, there's nothing wrong with one of our guys talking to somebody on  the phone there.  That's not illegal, and it's allowed.  Too bad they're lining up for your show.  Stop using a public sidewalk, then, assholes.  Make them line up in the studio.  Oh, we'll be back.  Oh, we'll be back.  Eric is a very willful young boy.  Rather naughty.  Rather naughty. 
[02:25:00]  All right, Keith.  Thanks.  All right.  I'll catch up.  Your son is attempting to bring an outside radio show into this situation.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Bye, Keith.  Yeah.  There goes the party pooper.  And you never even mentioned Oral.  You said just a back rub.  You didn't say.  Of course I did.  Did you?  Not that that makes any difference, but.  And I do believe that ends the Tony Danza saga for today.  There you go.  Yeah.  Danza's a bully.  Danza's brown shirts.  Yeah.  Nazis.  The three strikes law gets tested next week. 
[02:25:30]  Elo's listening right now.  I don't care.  O and A go live before the Boston home opener.  It's baseball.  It's life.  It's.  I got nothing.  O and A.  Now for those who find humor in sadism, then to some strange odd group of people, I guess  it's funny.  Quite frankly, I would love to be teabagged by donkey sausage on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:26:00]  Well, she's a girl.  She can't teabag me.  But you never know with these guys.  Oh, yes.  The virus is now free.  Opie and Anthony are finally free on XM202.  Oh, high voltage.  Oh, my God.  They just won't.  They won't leave that stuff alone.  XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly here with another Opie and Anthony interlocular. 
[02:26:30]  Hold on a sec.  Hold on.  This could be.  This is horrible.  Hello, Ms. Sausage or Donkey or?  Actually, my real name is Corinne.  So where did Donkey Sausage come from?  Well, the origin of Donkey Sausage was the day I happened to call.  They were late on the female callers, and I was calling because I wanted to play What's  in Your Pants.  So if you don't know what that is, you'll have to go to ona.com to find that out or foundyourmusic.com.  But anyway, this gentleman before that called before myself asked for a strange request. 
[02:27:00]  He said, why don't you get some dumb whore or some dumb whore bitch to run around the  room.  Wait, no, wait.  To shit on a plate, microwave it, throw it all over her chest, and run around the room  screaming Donkey Sausage.  So after he had called, I was like the next caller.  And actually, I went under an alias.  My name was Raquel when I called in because I was at work, and I didn't want to get in  trouble for it.  And actually, I quit because of the whole thing anyway.  But needless to say, Opie asked me if I would kindly run around my store screaming 
[02:27:30]  Donkey Sausage.  I said, sure, I can do that.  And Anthony was like, oh, make sure you say it all silly, real silly.  So I was like, Donkey Sausage, Donkey Sausage.  And I'm running around Radio Shack screaming Donkey Sausage.  And Jimmy was like, oh, that's kind of hot.  They were like, there's something oddly arousing by that.  Well, I thought it had to do with swallowing Big Giant.  Oh, well, I mean, I do that, but I do that privately.  I mean, there's appointments involved.  There's all kinds of stuff that goes behind the scenes on that. 
[02:28:00]  I mean, I've got many different aliases, and we don't have to talk about those.  There are plenty of members of the XM Nation who have no idea who O&A are, much less have  heard them.  You are selling O&A.  Oh, absolutely.  What do you say?  What the hell are you waiting for?  Turn on Opie and Anthony every day, 7 to 11.  And if you don't, I'm going to come to your job screaming Donkey Sausage until you get  fired.  How about that?  How about them apples?  That's right.  Yeah.  And ladies, do the wowing. 
[02:28:30]  Do the wowing.  It's good times.  Tell me about wowing.  Wowing?  Wowing is whip them out Wednesday or whip them out whenever.  If you see somebody with a wow sticker on their car, ladies are supposed to do their duties  and show them the breasts, or the boozies, I call them.  We do our part.  What does your significant other think about your membership in the O&A virus?  Well, right now I don't have a significant other because of certain activities I partake  in. 
[02:29:00]  So, you know, certain things that aren't allowed in relationships and I, you know, go over  every boundary that could possibly be put on the ground.  And I've actually had to get written, you know, have to get rid of some bodies when I get  back home today.  Do you have a website?  It's in works.  It's in the works right now.  But you can go to eatabullet.com and check out that website.  If you want to know more about donkey sausage, go to eatabullet.com.  That's a little too cute.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, God.  This started the Diva series, I believe, Anthony.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony worst of thing here.  And I just slurred Opie, my own name, but fuck it.  Just keep rolling tape.  I don't care.  We're on vacation.  I'll never hear this.  Coffee Diva, Anthony.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  That's it?  Well, what happened was, I believe it was either intern number one or intern number three  went to get me, well, fetch coffee for me. 
[02:30:00]  And they know that I like a certain type of a beverage.  And they believe he brought me back the incorrect brand.  And the wrath of Jimmy ensued.  I had to punish the intern.  In a way, I've never seen an intern punished.  In a sexy way.  Oh, was this the intro of that bit?  Oh, yeah.  Well, the only day we did that bit, that's when we have to bring back, by the way.  No, that's okay.  It was a fine punishment.  I know.  This gets a little saucy.  That actually is what happened to Pat O'Brien. 
[02:30:30]  He was just doing this bit into the telephone.  Cock in his hand.  Coffee Diva.  Say, Jim, nice meal.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  What is this?  If someone farts or...  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into this bit with a reading?  What is this?  What's the problem, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Kill him! 
[02:31:00]  I don't know.  But...  Oh, boy.  Derek, why is your face burning red?  Warm up your vocal cords.  You might be reading.  You might have to warm up that...  Where do we get our coffee every day?  All right, what's going on?  No one knows what's going on.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  Exactly.  But if it said Starbucks, you'd know that immediately.  Oh, yeah.  Ben, don't explain what's happening on the air because people hate your voice.  People...  Stop ruining things, Ben. 
[02:31:30]  You're ruining the show, Ben.  I don't like...  This is why...  Two reasons I don't like this coffee.  It doesn't taste good, and I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  Yeah, I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  Yep, you betcha, but at least they're not funding terrorism.  I will not support the savages.  How much money from one cup of coffee, from like a dollar cup of coffee, do you think goes to Al-Qaeda?  I'm not saying necessarily Al-Qaeda, but...  I would say probably 15 cents out of every buck. 
[02:32:00]  You might be right.  Yeah.  And even if it doesn't go to Al-Qaeda, it just goes to a guy who will watch a video of the insurgents and go,  Well, I see their point, and I just don't want him to have my 15 cents.  You don't want to support that, my friend.  Absolutely not.  You're insane.  I'm not insane.  I won't support it.  Did you get that cup of coffee from a raghead?  No, I got it downstairs.  Exactly, the ones that won't let me in.  Sometimes I come in at 5 to 6 or whatever.  Oh, we're closed.  I'm like, can I buy coffee?  No.  That's a normal, like, joint, though.  That's not one of those corner delis.  Whatever it is, I don't like it.  I like Starbucks. 
[02:32:30]  I like the big company that mushes the mom-and-pop awful companies.  Only because their coffee is always stale.  So did you tell him to go to Starbucks and he didn't?  You want to taste this?  You want to taste this and see how enjoyable this is?  Why don't you throw it against the wall, you diva?  I'm not a diva.  I just want Starbucks coffee.  Diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  Why are you picking up your Rent Boys book?  I don't know.  We all...  Look, I like him.  He's a good kid.  He's got a great smile. 
[02:33:00]  But we all...  We all know the rules.  Oh, God.  The show's going to turn gay again.  It's not going to turn gay.  I just pray there's a couple out there that wants to try to become the sexiest state in  America.  When you ask the intern for coffee and they know where you like your coffee from and they  come back...  Yeah, why did you go downstairs?  First of all, he didn't say anything about Starbucks and I haven't been on a coffee run  in like three weeks.  Oh, really?  Three or four weeks.  Really?  Well, I haven't saluted the flag in a little while, but I still know to do it when it's  in front of me.  Oh, God.  Is that valid?  No. 
[02:33:30]  Either way, as your punishment, because you're a fine young man and you work very hard, but  this was inexcusable, there will have to be another coffee run for Starbucks and you're  going to have to read, young man.  It's a very short paragraph from there to there and I want you to read with dignity and  I want you to read proudly.  No laughing.  Hold on.  Anthony, I wanted to explain because there's a lot of new listeners.  This is the...  This is the...  Jim's punishment.  This is the only bit that Jim Norton has officially brought to the O&A show.  Ever.  He contributes very nicely on a daily basis, but as far as bringing bits to the table,  he usually doesn't, but he decided to bring this one to the table. 
[02:34:00]  Brought in a lovely book entitled Rent Boys.  Don't fold it back.  You're bending the cover.  I like that picture.  Rent Boys.  On the cover is a nude man, young man covering his sensitives with his hand and another hand  tweaking his nipple on the cover.  And it's filled with stories of gay sex.  And Jim hands out these punishments to people around here when they do something wrong. 
[02:34:30]  And the punishment is to read from the book.  You have to read seriously.  You can't laugh it off like, you know, make a joke about it because then it just comes  off like a joke.  And what happens if he laughs during it?  Do you want him to pull his pants down and you can paddle him?  No, but if he laughs, believe me, I'll have him reading so much that his lips will be too  tired to laugh.  If he thinks Kaufman did some reading of The Great Gatsby, he will certainly be doing  some...  Love Andy Kaufman references.  Hey, hey, hey.  She gets a mood in here. 
[02:35:00]  It's like a mug Perino show with an intern saying things like this.  Great, huh?  You need a PlayStation young fella.  Dave from Jersey, he says, look, I never went for coffee there, but I know Norton loves  Starbucks.  That's right, Dave from Jersey.  All right.  And I like the fact that Starbucks is always fresh.  I'm not whoring for Starbucks.  I just like the...  It tastes the same every time.  I would rather be like a hip and cool guy and a hip and cool...  That's what you like.  I'd rather support a smaller thing.  Hey, I don't go with the big ones, man.  But the coffee always stinks in these places.  I'm sorry.  Stinks.  It's different every different place you go. 
[02:35:30]  Every place.  You're safe at Starbucks.  I like the flavor.  There you go.  Don't read ahead, young man.  Just be surprised as it happens.  All right.  Let her rip.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  All right.  He withdraws slowly, gently.  He stands up.  I reach over and peel the rubber away, letting it drop to the floor.  I hug him to me and place a now semi-flaccid cock in my mouth.  It no longer smells scrubbed.  I lick it.  I roll over on my back and hang my head over the edge of the bed.  I begin stroking my cock, intent now on my own orgasm. 
[02:36:00]  He bends his hard prick so that it slides easily into my mouth and down my throat.  As he begins to fuck my face, I close my eyes and breathe in the marvelous musky scent of  his sweaty, heavy ball sack.  Turn off.  Turn off.  I begin to cum.  He cannot stop me now.  Turn off.  Turn off.  My pleasure is so intense, I begin to choke on his flesh deep inside my throat. 
[02:36:30]  Smells like...  Oh, he tastes delicious.  Victory.  I will be generous with this boy.  Very generous.  Good job.  Thanks, fella.  Catch some coffee medium with skim milk.  Thank you.  It's going to smell like his musty, heavy sack.  Look, that was harder for us than it was for you.  That was difficult.  I don't like to meet out to punishments.  That was a bad one.  You could tell that was really, really bad. 
[02:37:00]  Dude, I don't like...  Do you think I like handing these out?  I think you do.  It helps people.  We really do.  Young Eric had a misstep the other day and did some reading, and might I say, he has been  in tip-top shape ever since.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into...  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know. 
[02:37:30]  It doesn't taste good, but I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to die against the devil.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  You betcha.  That's Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva. 
[02:38:00]  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  You're checking out the worst of Opiate Anthony.  We're both on vacation, but we're here kind of introing some of the worst of bits.  And who doesn't like a good duty story?  Duty.  This is Lil' Jimmy having a little problem in kindergarten, I believe.  Was it kindergarten?  It was kindergarten.  Kindergarten.  He had a little problem with duty.  Yeah.  Who knew? 
[02:38:30]  You were a stinky little kid, weren't you?  Yeah.  I was a little pants pooper and a real creep.  But I've seen pictures.  You were a very cute little kid.  I was the absolute, the yin and the yang.  I was so molestable, and yet my ass was caked with fecal matter.  Yeah.  So there you have a cute little kid that just stinks like shit.  Oh, what a horror show.  That was your protection.  Yeah.  Like a skunk.  Like a skunk.  He's like a skunk.  If an old man came up and tried to tussle his hair, he'd raise up his butt and just stink 
[02:39:00]  him out.  Yeah.  I'm sure a few snuck in there and tussled my cowlick head and put little Jimmy's face  in a pillow, and then all of a sudden I learned a natural defense.  You can walk it at you with a lollipop, get too close, and run away.  That's hilarious.  Duties.  It's the worst.  There will be an Anthony.  Are we all going to go to the bathroom?  Because I've got to go.  Let's all go to the bathroom.  The show started, and no one was here.  I'll go to the bathroom.  I'm going, too.  All right. 
[02:39:30]  Come on.  Let's all go.  Three men walking, talking.  Where's Ben?  We need an open window in there.  It's only eight degrees out.  Oh, he really.  I'm telling you, somebody scarred him as a child.  You know what it is?  Ben, in his little kindergarten class, went in there, and his little,  fat midget legs were hanging off the ball, not hitting the floor,  and he dropped an atomic log, and it probably reeked and stunk up the whole classroom.  Right.  That's why he opens that thing, because little Ben's duties smelled up the classroom.  Right. 
[02:40:00]  Open the door, and you know those bathrooms when you're in kindergarten?  They're right in the room.  Yep.  You don't go down the hallway.  Yep.  It's in the room.  So you get done.  You hear the whoosh.  The door opens up, and now the smell wafts into the kindergarten class,  and the little children all giggled, chuckled, and pointed at Big Doody Ben.  Well, I'll bet you the girl he had a crush on back then had to go right after,  and her and her little leather shoes went in right after old tsunami colon wrecked the 
[02:40:30]  little kindergarten bathroom, and she came out and started pointing at Stinky Doody Ben  and his messy kindergarten hair.  Gravy dripping down his leg onto his hush puppies.  Did you guys have the girl in grammar school that peed her pants,  and the teacher had to have the spare panties that she had to give her?  I never heard of the spare panties.  Oh, it's hilarious, man.  The janitor would come in with the sawdust and put it under her chair.  Oh, and there was just like the...  What is up with that?  The puddle of... 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, pee, right?  Dude, there was a girl, and we were all sitting in class, and it was very quiet,  and all you hear are the pencils on paper in the classroom,  and we just heard, like, the running water, water running off of a seat.  Yeah.  And we looked around.  Everyone starts looking around, and there she is, the girl,  just sitting there with this yellow stream pooled up in her seat  in her little elementary school plastic chair and dripping onto the floor.  And everyone just starts, oh. 
[02:41:30]  We had one of those, too.  She was just talking.  Her name was Rosemary.  Rosemary?  I won't give away her last name because I don't remember it.  I would love to call her out.  You've got to come over now, and, okay, students, back to work, back to work.  Right, right.  Try to calm the situation.  And then, okay, come here.  And then she's crying.  Rosemary's crying, and then the teacher walks her out with these little pair of panties  because now she's soiled herself.  Oh.  And Rosemary was known as the girl that peed in, like, second and third grade  and also was known as the girl that struck out in kickball.  Oh.  How do you strike out in kickball? 
[02:42:00]  Well, you pee your pants.  Yeah.  And then you see her.  We see her at, like, my high school reunion, right?  She's a hot piece of ass.  Oh, boy.  But she will always be known.  Always.  In this circle as the girl that peed her pants in class and struck out in kickball.  That's what happens.  There were guys that would throw up in class or girls that throw up,  and you're the puke guy, you know, for the rest of eternity.  My first attempt at sarcasm, I was a little boy.  I had a crush on little Kelly Howell. 
[02:42:30]  Remember her name?  Oh.  Oh, little Kelly.  I had a crush on her.  And I had a horrible habit of only being able to go to the bathroom at home.  I could never go in school.  I would always dump in my pants.  Always.  I told you one time I was walking.  Dude, I mean, nightmare proportions.  Wait, how old were you when you were dumping in your...  This is second or third grade.  Third grader, you're dumping in your pants.  Constantly, but I remember...  You have to sit knowing those logs are in there until you go home.  On a side note, before I get back to the Kelly...  Well, Kelly Howell one time, it just smelled like rust. 
[02:43:00]  I'd have been sitting there for hours.  It was like after you do it and you sit and you can feel it cool.  It's cool against your cheek.  Oh, God.  And she was standing behind me, and I was, like, really nervous because she was there.  And she's like, did you go poops in your pants?  And I was like, yeah, sure.  I tried to be sarcastic, although I was honest.  One time I was in sixth grade.  You should never have one story, let alone two.  Dude, I have 50.  Me and my friend Billy D'Angelo used to walk to school together, and I stopped by Bill's 
[02:43:30]  house, and I had one coming on, and again, I could never use anyone else's bathroom.  I don't know where all this shame about my system comes from.  So I tried to break it off and stop, but a piece broke off, and it rolled down my pant  leg, and I kicked it out, and Bill saw it and laughed.  What a guy.  He laughed.  Yeah, I was like a rock cat.  Duty diva.  You're like, that was a defense mechanism for you.  It actually went 40 yards, so too bad I wasn't playing football this weekend.  Yeah, for the Jets.  V.O.B. and Anthony Schell. 
[02:44:00]  Oh my God, there's a part two to the Norton Duty story?  Of course.  I thought that was going to be it.  There were so many unanswered questions in part one, and I'm looking forward to part  two.  Well, it was kind of like a cliffhanger.  Yeah.  Well, all right, the log is half out.  What happens next?  What happens?  Will it fall on our Caped Crusader's face?  I hope this is better than Caddyshack 2.  It's Duty Stories 2.  Yeah, this is more of that.  I'll just shut up and play the tape. 
[02:44:30]  You're right.  Because you're talking during the tape.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, you are.  Opie.  I'm listening.  Shh.  Shh.  Quiet.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Are you bathing?  Learning way too much about Jim Norton during the break.  That was a fun little bathroom trip.  We really just got to bring audio equipment to the bathroom, because that's when Jimmy really  starts confessing.  Did he say he has vivid memories of making it in his pants 60 to 70 times?  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  I don't have 70 memories, but I can remember.  It got so bad.  And I was probably in 6th or 7th grade.  And it was all dumps in your pants?  Wait, 6th or 7th grade now?  Yeah, what I would do is, I hated using public restrooms.  Wait, wait, you were still dumping in your pants in 6th grade?  Not like I just didn't know what was happening, but I would try to hold it, and sometimes a  little piece would come out, but I can remember standing under my sink, my mother's like,  I'm not doing it anymore, and I had the water running and soap in the water, and I was scrubbing  it, cleaning my own white, tighty-whities, like I lived on Little House on the Prairie. 
[02:45:30]  This is 1979.  Going down to the river and beating it on a rock.  I really am an ass.  With a stick.  Oh, that's awful.  Maybe some therapist can call in, because I used to hate going to the bathroom.  I would kind of like just kneel by my bed, and I would hold it for as long as I  could, just kneeling in my bed.  Even in your house?  Oh yeah, I would like just kneel by my bed, and like, I'd be kneeling like I was praying,  but I wasn't praying, I was kind of reading on the bed, and I would just kind of like  zone out, and hold it.  Don't ask me what that means, I don't know. 
[02:46:00]  You can't just, you couldn't just walk into the bathroom in your own house?  No, no, no, it wasn't a fear of that, I just, I don't know, there was something cool  about holding it.  Oh, okay, now it's something completely different.  Yeah, yeah, that was a totally different scenario, that was just a...  Something cool about holding it.  Yeah, it's like the way, it was a weird zone out going through.  Why didn't Helen help you out with this?  I don't know, maybe Jimmy's cape one time got a log on it, and Helen got mad.  But I, now it hasn't translated into now.  What happened to you as a kid, I need to know.  There's a stranger walking around right now, with, you know, because I was a little blonde 
[02:46:30]  boy, I'll bring you in baby pictures, I was a little, believe me, if you like kids, I  wanted to molest myself when I saw baby pictures.  How could anybody not touch me?  Little stomach I had at Avalon when I was a boy.  That's, I need to know what happened.  And I wouldn't even blame whoever did it.  I deserved it.  You did.  Running around with my blonde locks, adorable face, begging for it.  You have pictures of young Jimmy on your website.  Eatabullet.com. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, yeah, it's, I got plugged, this is automatic.  Eatabullet.com has a little...  Little Jimmy grows up.  So you can see little Jimmy's pictures on that website.  It truly is an unsolved mystery, though.  And as you look at his cute little pictures, just think there was probably a steaming hot  load of crap in his pants.  Yeah.  As I force a smile, because it's almost over.  Unsolved mystery.  What's in Jimmy's pants? 
[02:47:30]  Who touched Jimmy as a kid?  Who touched little Jimmy Norden?  We need your help.  Please go to the website and look at his picture.  If it looks familiar, call us.  Let us know if you're the reason he dumped in his pants for so many years.  Unsolved mystery.  Why did Jimmy find it so dramatic to use a bathroom, but now he likes being used as a bathroom?  These mysteries and more must be solved with the help of our viewers. 
[02:48:00]  Cute little Jimmy.  He'll be the cute little blonde boy with a little lump in the back of his pants.  Not to be confused with the messy-haired kid with a big lump in the front of his pants.  It certainly is a mystery.  It all started with a touch somewhere.  Believe me, I'm not...  You really don't know?  No.  I'll tell you.  Please.  I suspect that, too, just because I show all the signs. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  But I really do have no memories of it.  So it's like, I could have been...  Freaky pervert is what you are.  I was a little dirty boy.  I told you I used to act out sexually.  So I'm wondering if it's just one of those things where I was experimenting at that age.  And I'm an addict.  So, like, anything that was, like, weird or whatever, I was hooked on immediately.  Yeah.  I had a sexual addiction from the time I was a kid.  Wow.  It may not have been brought on by an adult.  It may have just been me and some little dumbbell exploring.  I told you I still remember Julie, her ass... 
[02:49:00]  I'm an ass freak.  And I tried to get her to sit on my little second-grade lap, and she didn't want to.  So I'm like, all right, well, here are some sticker bushes.  You could sit on my lap, or you could sit on the sticker bushes.  And she sat in the sticker bushes.  And that set a pattern for old Jim Norton and his relationship with women.  I lost out to sticker bushes, and I wonder why my self-esteem is awful.  Yeah.  Janice, I remember Janice putting her hiney in my face in the woods.  Devil's Creek and Edison.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Help!  If everybody had a porch across the USA, then everybody'd be playing the game of Monster Rain. 
[02:49:30]  You'd see them dropping their trousers.  You know we can't abstain.  A bushy, bushy young scrotum playing Monster Rain.  You'll catch me sucking off Jimmy.  We're sucking all damn day.  But just because we like blowing, that doesn't make us gay. 
[02:50:00]  It's so awesome.  All over my t-shirt, and oozing down the drain.  Everybody is playing, playing Monster Rain.  We're taking off our tighty-whities, here in the pouring rain.  We're waxing down our members, and f***ing out our brains.  All under the front porch, we're gonna leave a stain. 
[02:50:30]  Tell the teacher we're playing.  Playing Monster Rain.  Imagine Jim going to his mom.  Mom, going outside to play Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  Okay, Jimmy, have fun.  So Monster Rain, if the rain hit you, something bad would happen, so you'd have to get out of  the rain, right?  Drink out of this.  It's an antidote for Monster Rain.  Help!  I'm here.  The doctor's here.  Wow.  What a sick, twisted little boy. 
[02:51:00]  Playing Monster Rain.  The three strikes law gets tested next week.  Elo's listening right now.  I don't care.  O&A go live before the Boston home opener.  It's baseball.  It's life.  It's...  I got nothing.  XM Satellite Radio, celebrating the first free week of O&A.  Whoops.  Sorry.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony are overpaid. 
[02:51:30]  But then again, so is Bob Edwards, the XM PR ghoul.  Oh, yes.  The virus is now free.  Opie and Anthony.  Do you ever think about when you were on the air, and you guys were syndicated nationally  before, but that you're truly covering every inch of the United States and Canada and Mexico,  plus, you are now worldwide on XMRadio.com on the web. 
[02:52:00]  Ooh.  Yeah, I just wish we could block out Alabama.  Yeah.  Judging from their phone calls.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  We thought it was a good thing until we took that first call from Alabama.  We don't know if that guy was retarded or if that's how they speak down there.  A whole new country down there.  Does anyone speak Alabama in this room?  Alabama-an.  Alabama-ian?  Yeah.  You know, I don't think you sit here and think about it.  Kind of cool, but I think you crack the mic and go, oh my God, get me a map, a geographical  survey map of where we're broadcasting to. 
[02:52:30]  You know, you see it on the phone, so all of a sudden it'll pop up and you'll get a weird  place that comes up on the phone.  So, yeah, it's cool to be national.  Yeah.  It sunk in for me when I was out in L.A. I had my MiFi and I was listening to, you know,  the show in Hollywood.  I was like, oh, okay, I guess we are doing something cool now.  Yeah.  The potential is there.  It's just going to get bigger.  I mean, every market is going to grow in and it's nice to not have to grovel for those  Viacom jizz buckets and beg for a new market when they have just awful programming already  on them, but they're too afraid that this show is going to explode and cause a problem.  So it's just nice to see that, you know, you're on every market already.  All you got to do is just be good and you'll build up. 
[02:53:00]  End of quote.  It sure clears things up, doesn't it?  The worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's just sad.  Oh, my God.  Frankie Blue, Anthony.  Frankie Blue.  Oh, yeah.  Time for the Frankie Blue audio.  Radio legend Frankie Blue.  Yeah, he was in charge of WNEW, our old station in New York, for a little while. 
[02:53:30]  Had a couple of months there, and he pretty much blew his career there with this little  move, getting drunk and going on the air and being hilarious.  After a Christmas party.  Yeah.  And the best part about this, he was supposed to be the responsible one.  Right.  He's the boss, getting hammered and just saying silly things on the air.  Here's part one.  One.  All right.  Part one of the Frankie Blue audio.  It's the worst.  Opie and Anthony.  So you think this is funny, the Frankie Blue thing?  I do.  I love it.  Anytime you can... 
[02:54:00]  It's very voyeuristic.  Even though it's going out to a bunch of people on the radio, I think this is very voyeuristic.  It's an uncomfortable situation.  It's somebody put in a position they shouldn't have been in.  Well, I guess what happened, our old radio station, WNEW.  Yeah.  There's a curse with our old station ever since we left.  Ever since we left, it's just been in the toilet.  They can't figure out what to do with the station.  And it's just failing miserably.  Ratings are always in the toilet. 
[02:54:30]  They have tried how many different formats?  They've tried three or four since we left.  And the one that did the best was the three months that they played Christmas music last year.  Right.  They started like at Halloween and played it through New Year.  And it did better than any format they put on there.  Well, our old company, they hired this dope John Sykes who was supposed to help the radio division.  And the radio division has been a disaster ever since he took the helm.  And now they're just kind of paying him and he's like in a little office and no one bothers him because he's under contract. 
[02:55:00]  They're going to fire him real soon.  But he had no business trying to run the radio division of Viacom.  Got to bump Joel Hollander up into that position.  He's the genius.  Joel Hollander is an amazing radio guy and he will right the ship.  But this guy, John Sykes, which is just a waste of space.  An asshole.  A two-faced fuck.  You know, he told Anthony and I when we did the Sex with Sam thing, that crazy-haired dick, that we were going to be okay.  He said we were going to be okay.  And then all of a sudden he just blew us off, never talked to us again, and then just hid behind lawyers and his secretary and stuff. 
[02:55:30]  Never could get him on the phone again.  And we find out how he didn't like the show, didn't like what we were doing.  That's the type of executive you want running your radio division.  A guy that doesn't have balls and will tell you to your face what's going on, you know.  Oh, didn't he think it was bad for kids, the show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, he thought he knew what he was doing and we get fired.  And the station has been a complete disaster ever since.  And the radio division, quite frankly, has been a complete disaster ever since. 
[02:56:00]  They've lost millions upon millions of dollars.  And in the end, it was John Sykes' fault.  Simple as that.  Joel Hollander wasn't running the radio division back then.  He just wasn't.  And anyway, it's unheard of in radio history to have a station that has been floundering for as long as any W.  It just doesn't happen.  When that happens at a station, they fix it.  They fix the problem.  Especially in New York.  Right.  It's the number one mark in the country.  Right.  You can't have a radio property just sitting there with one rating. 
[02:56:30]  And a history like any W has.  Yeah.  It's in last place.  There are radio stations that don't even have a signal, a strong signal in Manhattan that are beating our old station.  Easy listening music stations from Long Island beat it out.  Right.  It's ridiculous.  So getting back to the Frankie Blue thing in our old radio station that has just been in the toilet ever since we left.  Falling apart.  Because they really thought they knew what they were doing by firing us and moving on.  Oh, yeah.  They figured they would compete with other stations that are doing very well around New York. 
[02:57:00]  Because, boy, there's a win situation.  Go head-to-head against stations that are just entrenched in the market.  Have great ratings doing what they're doing.  Because people will just change their habits like that for the same thing they could get in the place that they've been for years and years and years.  Now, RuPaul is what?  Their morning person now, aren't they?  It was RuPaul.  Person.  That's good.  Oh, whatever.  Yeah.  Morning guy.  It's a guy.  Morning parental disappointment.  When I...  It's RuPaul the drag queen does mornings over there.  Okay.  When I sit there and you have to listen to some people go, RuPaul, she is so pretty. 
[02:57:30]  It's got a cock.  It's a guy.  Boy, you're a buzzkill.  Fine.  So then the old company gets the bright idea to hire this Frankie Blue guy because he was really good at KTU, I guess.  What was KTU?  Kind of like a dance mix station?  Yeah, kind of like commercial dance music.  Like dance music.  So they're like, well, we'll hire the guy that made KTU great and we'll put him on NEW and he'll have the same success over here. 
[02:58:00]  Right.  Well, so far he hasn't done anything except get drunk at Christmas gatherings.  Oh.  And Earl was there, too.  Yeah, our old pal Earl was here.  Earl.  Was there, I should say.  And Earl did not give us this tape.  I want to go on the record and tell you he did not have anything to do with the tape we're about to play.  He didn't.  Okay.  So Frankie Blue was at the Christmas luncheon a couple days ago. 
[02:58:30]  A Christmas luncheon?  They did a Christmas luncheon and I guess everyone got completely hammered.  I would, too, if I was working over there.  As a matter of fact, I did many times.  He got destroyed, everyone else.  And with the ratings that just came out, I think he had a few extra shots because he's probably thinking, well, my God, I'm a fraud at this point.  Oh, boy.  So then he goes back to the station and he gets into some kind of argument with the DJ that was supposed to go on the air.  Now, if he was a little tipsy at the time, I'm thinking it probably wasn't one of those good, legitimate arguments where you have a point. 
[02:59:00]  I've been in arguments with drunk people.  They don't usually make good points during arguments.  You ever notice that?  What is that?  Why you got to wear that fucking shirt?  There's a good argument.  This one will last about 18 hours straight.  So that's what he does.  He goes over there, gets in a little tiff.  And it's the DJ that's supposed to go on the air.  She pretty much runs out of the station crying or something.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  Oh, boy.  But something happened and she just ran out. 
[02:59:30]  So now someone has to do the radio show.  So who do they get to do the show?  Well, Frankie Blue is the boss over there.  He decides, oh, fuck her.  I'll just do it.  He's going to take the mic.  He's not a DJ?  He's not on air?  He's the program guy.  He's a legendary, quote, programmer here in New York.  Was he ever on the air?  You'll see how legendary he is in a minute here.  And then he goes, oh, fuck, I don't need her.  I'll just do her shift.  And I'll do probably a better job.  Now he's doing it for WNEW.  During this, he's talking about KTU, which is their arch rival in competition. 
[03:00:00]  He's just using the KTU call letters.  He makes a mistake and actually says, you know, on 1027 WKTU.  KTU.  And it's NEW.  Yeah, that's the station they're trying to beat.  Yeah.  Oops.  Oh, they must have been loving this at KTU.  I bet they play this and just laugh their balls off.  So Ben has been playing this all morning in the office just laughing like an idiot.  Like Ben.  I think it's hilarious. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Earl's there.  You know, Earl jumps on the air at some point.  Earl was the producer.  Board op.  Yeah.  He's the board op guy.  The girl that does the show is supposed to do that.  And Earl hits the buttons when she goes to commercials and stuff like that.  He operates the board.  Yeah.  So he had to board op for Frankie, who's all hammered.  Right.  And who's his boss.  And who's his boss.  So Earl, I guess you hear him chime in a couple of times, I guess just out of nervousness.  And, you know, he must have been sitting there going, oh, my God.  This guy's hammered. 
[03:01:00]  He can't even talk.  He's stammering.  He's forgetting words.  Because he hiccups in one word, and it makes the word two words.  Yeah.  And Earl's just like you can tell.  He's really nervous.  And then you've got to understand, too, this is one of those radio stations where you talk  really quickly between the music.  The music's the most important thing.  If you're talking more than 30 seconds, you're not doing your job.  He's talking for about four minutes here.  Oh, I know.  We cut it down.  But, you know, we'll play about two and a half minutes of this.  But he's just babbling about nothing, saying the wrong call letters.  This is the boss of the radio station that was supposed to put WNEW back on the map. 
[03:01:30]  Here you go.  In New York radio.  The boss.  So here, you know, I've got to be honest.  If they got Frankie Blue drunk every day to do a radio show, the ratings would go through  the roof.  I'd listen every day.  Absolutely.  And I hate that type of music.  But that's the type of thing they should do.  Just get drunks on the air.  Drunk DJs.  Drunk DJs.  Uh-huh.  I love this song.  This is the fucking boss.  I love this song.  He's fucking hammered. 
[03:02:00]  And don't think for a second that this is some kind of relaxed, laid-back delivery.  Yeah, this is not radio from the 70s.  No, all the DJs were encouraged to talk like this.  This guy's hammered.  This is the type of station where, you know, your voice has to be way up there.  Like, WKTU.  Yeah, high energy.  Don't forget RuPaul at the Mardhead.  Yeah.  High energy.  Your next chance to win $2,000.  Coming up with RuPaul tomorrow morning, right here.  RuPaul, let's get back to the music.  Right.  The new mix.  W-N-E-W.  That's the delivery you're supposed to have. 
[03:02:30]  Right.  Andy completely messes up.  You're supposed to hit the post, which is stop talking right when the vocals kick in.  Oh.  He goes right over.  Oh, I know.  Listen.  Stomps on it.  And he's the boss.  Uh-huh.  I love this song.  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Wow.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been, um, giving you a chance to win $50,000 
[03:03:00]  in cash.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  That is snotted.  Wow.  Hey, this is Frankie Blue.  This was the guy that was supposed to get N-E-W out of the toilet.  He's taking the record off the turntable.  You think he's going to use the turntable?  Oh, I take pleasure in this.  God.  That dumb station.  They really stink. 
[03:03:30]  Oh.  In the Mix 1027 redo.  And plus win a Toyota Scion.  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's  house like Publishing Clearance. 
[03:04:00]  Publishing.  Why?  Publishing Clearance?  Did he try to say, like, Publishers Clearinghouse?  Yeah.  Publishing Clearance.  Publishing Clearance.  Oh, man.  Hey, I've been snotted on the air a couple of times, but never.  Your station is cursed.  The devil.  Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like Publishing Clearance. 
[03:04:30]  Or whether it's a house or it's a job.  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you.  And we're going to reward you with $50,000 and a brand new Toyota.  And I don't see how you cannot be happy about that.  This is Frankie Blue.  So make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m.  50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner. 
[03:05:00]  What?  I mean, is they're giving away 50 people who are going to win a grand?  Wait.  50 grand prize winner.  50 winners of the grand prize?  Or is it 50 grand prize winner?  I don't know.  Or is it a real drunk guy on the air?  And when you do one of these shows, you know, you have to speak perfectly.  Okay.  I know I speak like an idiot.  My grammar stinks.  But it doesn't really matter.  It's a talk show.  You just go with the flow.  And if I fuck up, you know, someone's going to jump on me and tell me so. 
[03:05:30]  But at these radio stations, everything has to be just perfect.  Right.  And you're not supposed to just babble and babble.  You've got to get back to the music.  Yeah.  As far as I'm concerned, you guys never fuck up.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  Very sweet.  Just enjoy your hustler and let us do the heavy lifting here, okay?  That's funny.  That's right.  50 grand prize winner of the redo contest of the winner of the Toyota Scion.  Come on, baby. 
[03:06:00]  You know you want it.  If you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick the winner.  And I thought he was really going to go for it.  RuPaul's going to dip his fat cock in that.  He's going to put some Elmer's glue on the tip of his big fat cock.  Because that's a guy, you know.  Dip it into the winner and pick out one. 
[03:06:30]  You know, when we were in the bathroom, I was holding RuPaul's fat cock.  This is the boss.  I love this.  Winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick the winner, and we're going to fine you.  Earl Loth is fine right there.  And I don't know if it takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right?  We have the armored truck. 
[03:07:00]  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town.  So why don't you give me a call?  Mike, this is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez.  And telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-MIX-1027.  So give me a call.  Okay, baby?  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, baby.  If you're in your car right now, chances are you're sitting in traffic. 
[03:07:30]  And then he goes back on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we got one more?  This is where he screws up the call letters.  This is really funny.  Which is just probably the biggest radio faux pas you could ever make, is screwing up those  calls, and especially when you screw them up by replacing them with the competition's  call letters.  Right.  He's supposed to, for people all over the country, say WNEW, but it says KTU, which is  their arch rival.  Pick the two stations in your city that battle it out between each other, and picture one 
[03:08:00]  of the jocks being drunk and making the mistake of using the other station's call.  So here's the boss at our old station.  I'd drink, too, if I was the boss over at that shithole.  Completely hammered.  Ratings are in the toilet.  He has to go on the air.  He thought he could handle it.  And this is some more of him doing his little show.  Mix 1027.  The new Mix 1027.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow. 
[03:08:30]  Oh.  He's like all the old Foster Brooks.  I'm so excited for tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Oh.  Tomorrow.  A drunken hiccup comes out of him in mid-word.  Nice buzz, man.  Wow.  That must have been a great Christmas luncheon.  Must have been luncheon.  What time was this going on?  I guess luncheon.  He's on the air at the 7 to 12 shift at night.  So the luncheon was probably, you know, what, noon, 1? 
[03:09:00]  Noon to 3, 4 maybe?  Love the nooners, man.  Pounding them during the nooners.  Here we go.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky and Rue coming in in the morning.  Putting a hand in the big old barrel and picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner. 
[03:09:30]  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo.  Oh, there it is.  Winner of the KTU Mix 102.  Oh, where the hell do I work?  Is he going to start singing Janis Joplin tunes?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  This doesn't sound like just alcohol, by the way.  That's my opinion.  Dude, this sounds like you're fired.  Yeah.  This is a firing offense. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, because this is the boss.  This isn't some stupid DJ that has a coke problem that you're trying to take care of.  What?  She should be fired for walking off the shift.  What kind of the boss?  Dude, did she told her to leave?  Oh, he told her to leave?  It just shows you that the old place is still a fucking train wreck.  Yeah, it is.  It's a dump.  Yeah, smart move.  Getting rid of Opie and Anthony.  The only thing that was happening over there.  Even when you were there, it stunk, except for Ron and Fez.  Those guys did okay.  Well, us and Ron and Fez, we kept the ship going. 
[03:10:30]  Yep.  They were making a lot of money off our show and Ron and Fez.  They should have backed us.  Instead, they got this mess.  Two years later, two and a half years later, they still have nothing.  Some of the most entertaining programming I've ever heard out of that station, though, right here.  I would put this guy on the air every day drunk.  Every day drunk.  I would listen every freaking day.  And he's, quote, a legend in New York radio.  Wow.  A fiery wreck today on our wreck cam.  Boy, that's a bad one.  That is a bad one today.  How embarrassed do you think he is this morning if he's up yet? 
[03:11:00]  Oh, my God.  When you wake up sober and you'll hear it, you'll be like, ugh.  All hungover, shaking, feeling a little nauseous.  Your head is pounding and your phone's ringing.  Frankie.  Yeah, Frankie, pick up.  Pick up.  Yeah, I heard your air jet.  What, are you stupid?  You fucking drunk?  You get a call from Infinity yet? 
[03:11:30]  You will.  Yeah, you will.  Take a couple of aspirin and get your ass out of bed, because I'm sure you'll be in a meeting today.  Can you say fired?  Fired.  Yeah, call up Opie and Anthony.  They'll give you some pointers on what to do during your time off.  You idiot.  And it's not like nobody's heard this clip.  This clip just hasn't been circulating through the radio circles all morning, you know?  It's like, dude, I emailed it to everybody this morning.  Frankie, it's your mom.  Hi.  How you doing?  But Dr. Phil said when you give something up to replace it with something else, so I 
[03:12:00]  was good to see you giving up the N.E.W. call letters and replacing it with the KTU call  letters, you stupid fuck.  I'm your mother, so I can say that.  Come on over.  We'll do shots.  I love you.  Oh, isn't that great?  There's just a little more here.  I hear this.  I've got to hear the KTU thing again.  I hear this is a third clip.  No, no.  This is it.  No, this is the...  Rumor has it there's a third clip.  Well, I think this, at this point, is when he was removed.  After this break, he was removed from the station. 
[03:12:30]  Who removed him?  The general manager.  Oh, that is not good.  The GM came in and took him off the air?  He's the Mac Daddy at every radio station.  Doesn't go much higher than the GM.  Who finished the shift?  I would assume they probably just played music.  Probably just played music and Earl pushed the button.  That's good.  When your big boss has to come into the studio and you're supposed to be in charge of all  your DJs and tell you to get the fuck off the air.  Get off.  You had it.  You are so fired.  Go home.  Fired.  Come out like the manager going to the mound.  Just get out. 
[03:13:00]  Get out.  Do you got the KTU line in there again?  Did you rewind it a little?  I got to hear him screw up on the calls again.  Yeah.  He's supposed to say WNEW once again.  As winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest.  And also you win a Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner. 
[03:13:30]  And then they're going to fight that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 102.7.  He's stepping all over.  He's supposed to be done by the time those lyrics kick in.  That is like the most important thing in that type of radio.  That type of radio?  Man, you've got to hit the post.  It's called hit the post.  Right, exactly.  What did he say?  We're going to fuck the winner?  That sounded like it.  Oh, is that where they thought he cursed?  Yeah.  I didn't even notice that until we just listened to it.  Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull. 
[03:14:00]  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fuck that winner.  Fuck.  What?  What was that?  I think he said fuck.  They're going to fuck that winner.  I think he was going to say fuck and was able to stop just in time.  Fuck that winner.  Fuck.  That's not a word.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel. 
[03:14:30]  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fuck that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 1027 Frankie Blue.  What's happening?  Tries to have the cool little thing like he's out.  Like diamonds just step all over the vocals.  Frankie Blue, what's happening, baby?  All I know is the FCC should hear about that.  Oh, and they're going to fuck that winner.  At least you guys never said that. 
[03:15:00]  Huh?  Right in the asshole.  Frankie Blue, baby.  Da, da, da.  They're going to stick it in the barrel.  And they're going to pull it out.  And fuck the fucking fucker.  Frankie Blue, baby.  On KTU.  W-N-E double.  W.  The Opie and Anthony.  K-N-B-C.  On the Rock of Boston, BCN. 
[03:15:30]  Where am I?  On W-D-R-U-N-K.  Well, this story is developing, but I do believe he's fired.  Fired.  How long has he been there?  Not too long, man.  He was supposed to be the big hire that was going to turn around that crap hole.  That was it.  He was going to be the guy.  At the turnpike, that big fire.  Jersey turnpike.  You know what?  That's got to be doing to traffic. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We have audio.  Ridgefield.  General manager coming in to Frankie Blue.  You're fired.  Do you have the audio of Frankie Blue after he was fired?  If I may.  A little more.  All right.  You're fired.  Wow.  You had to tell him twice.  And trying to console him, I guess.  It's over, Johnny.  Oh.  And then Frankie Blue.  Okay.  We got some Frankie Blue audio here?  Yeah.  Don't you do it. 
[03:16:30]  Don't you.  I got nowhere else to go.  Oh.  I got nowhere else to go.  I love when it's someone else, man.  Oh, it is a treat when it's not us.  All right.  Well, we have to take a break.  These guys are getting bored.  How about this? 
[03:17:00]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I think we got a couple more things to get to before the eggnog drinking contest for the MiFi.  That's right, baby.  How about we start the contest at 8 o'clock so these guys know?  8 o'clock, we'll start the eggnog drinking contest.  8 o'clock, we're starting the contest.  So they got a half hour if they want to, you know, maybe get coffee or something.  Yeah.  They got a half hour to get there.  Let them know, Hawk.  That's right, baby.  All right.  That's okay, baby.  Frankie Blue here, baby.  We're going to have a winner, and we're going to fuck them, and we're going to... 
[03:17:30]  I can play that all morning.  Oh, it's classic.  Ben, good call, by the way.  I wasn't sure if we should go with it.  I love it.  I wasn't sure if it was that good, but it is hilarious.  This is the Opie and Anthony show here at Sirius Satellite Radio.  That's right, baby.  Opie Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:18:00]  Comedy gone too far.  If you're listening right now, I think you just heard the first part of the Frankie Blue audio, right?  So it would be very obvious at this point to just play part two of Frankie Blue.  And why would we have to, you know, explain it again?  Because you should have been listening a little while ago, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So just listen to part two of the Frankie Blue audio.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  THE Opie and Anthony's greatest album. 
[03:18:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Okay, terrific.  That's terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  Okay, terrific.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  All right.  Got a few updates.  Because this show is a soap opera. 
[03:19:00]  We know that.  The saga that is Frankie Blue is over, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Is over.  Hopefully we replayed the Frankie Blue stuff in some of the worst of in the past few days.  Oh, yeah, we did.  We did?  Thursday.  Oh, good.  So a lot of people know what we're talking about here then.  Because we got a lot of new listeners through the holiday.  Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue.  Frankie blew up his spot there at N.E.W.  Blue, you're my boy.  You're my boy, Blue. 
[03:19:30]  Thanks for all the great radio.  Sorry you got fired.  You're my boy, Blue.  You're my boy, Blue.  You're my boy.  I don't have one today.  Oh, hold on.  Well, because I'm using your thing for this.  For the porno.  Hold on.  Now you're back.  You're fired.  Blue, you're my boy.  You're fired.  You're my boy, Blue.  So you want to explain Frankie Blue really fast, Anthony? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, Frankie Blue was the program director, you know, the boss over there at the station  we used to work at, W.N.E.W. in New York.  And they do like, what would you call that music?  Music that gay guys play when they're having sex?  Yeah, you could call it that.  I don't know what it is.  It's like that dance type music and like music that dopey chicks put on in their car all the time. 
[03:20:30]  Just that crap.  What's a good example?  Like a song that they would play?  I don't know.  I'm just trying to like, so people get the grasp of the type of station it is, to know that it's not like this,  where you could come on drunk, people have, you know, and get away with it.  It's not that type of thing.  It's very fast delivery that the jocks give.  And Frankie Blue was at a Christmas party.  He got a little tanked, it seemed, went back to his station and got in a little argument with the girl that was supposed to be coming on the air. 
[03:21:00]  And that's what they're saying he got fired for.  Right.  It's just for the argument.  But he figures now she's gone.  He threw her out of there that day.  Now he was going to take to the airwaves and show the talent that is Frankie Blue, all hammered from the Christmas party.  He gets on just slurring and stumbling through the show that he was doing.  And then I think the worst thing I think that he did, he called WNEW WKTU, which is the competitor of the station. 
[03:21:30]  So it kind of, it really looked bad.  You're not supposed to be the boss doing that.  And at the time, we got a hold of this tape and exploited it to the max.  Of course we did.  And now there's radio guys all over the country that have copies of this and they're playing it for each other.  They think it's one of the greatest things ever.  I've talked to more radio guys that said, oh my God, I'm sending this to everybody.  And all the guys in radio were playing it, listening to it, like it was the funniest thing ever.  Yeah.  Because we love when people screw up. 
[03:22:00]  Especially when it has something to do with our old station.  Yep.  Another program director losing his job at our old station.  Yeah.  They've been through a lot of them since we left it.  It's been an abomination since they unjustly booted you guys.  That is correct, sir.  An abomination in the biggest radio market in the country.  Yeah.  And that station has been an abomination for the last two and a half years.  You wouldn't see...  An embarrassment.  You wouldn't see a station this screwed up in a 200 market. 
[03:22:30]  You wouldn't see it.  And this is the number one market in the country, and it has been just a mess for years.  A disaster.  A legendary station.  After the music went down, they put you guys on, and you're the only thing on the station.  And then Ron and Fez start to do very well.  Of course there's no morning show, because they don't want to compete with Howard in New York.  So they put nothing on in the morning.  It's just an embarrassment, man.  It has been.  And the revolving door of program directors that have gone through there.  If you take that gig, you're insane. 
[03:23:00]  Because you're not going to be the one that straightens it out.  There is no quick fix for that place, and they're not in it for the long haul.  So you're just done.  There's no quick fix.  But they don't want to wait for a longer solution to take place,  so they just keep firing the people that can't fix it quick enough,  or they get drunk on the air.  At least that was an original firing.  The past bosses of program directors that have been through there have been fired  because it just hasn't worked out. 
[03:23:30]  They can't get the station going.  And now they've got some new guy.  I thought Steve had gotten a new job over at NEW when I read this.  It says Martini returns to NEW as PD.  It's Rick Martini, I guess.  I thought they meant Martini Steve.  Yeah, Rick Martini.  A 25-year radio veteran.  Did a lot with his career, obviously.  You know what's wrong with 25-year radio veterans?  He's going to bring nothing new to NEW. 
[03:24:00]  Nothing new.  A 25-year veteran uses all the stuff he's learned over 25 years,  which is the same old crap that no one wants to listen to.  It's not new.  It's not cutting edge.  It's not something people are going to tune into and go,  wow, this is something.  I've got to hear this.  Because they'll hear it elsewhere.  No one's going to switch.  If you could go to KTU, say,  which is the other station that plays this kind of crap,  do we have one of those songs?  Do we actually have one?  They play this?  Are you kidding me? 
[03:24:30]  Isn't this Donna Summer?  This is Donna Summer.  Last Dance.  Hey, baby, it's Frankie Blue.  It's Donna Summer.  And we're going to listen to this last dance.  Last Dance, Earl.  Dance with me, Earl.  You're working my board for me today.  It's Frankie Blue, baby.  Let me tell you something.  We're here at WKY.  W-L-E.  Right.  KTU.  Where are we in the double-dip or double-shit? 
[03:25:00]  W-L-S-T.  Oh, no, that's what I took before I came in.  W.  Give me another drink here.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  W-E-E-E.  Oh, no, that's something else I took before I came in today.  I'm sorry.  Frankie Blue, baby.  You know, this is a Christmas party I won't forget very soon.  A Christmas party that got me fired,  and I didn't even copy my sack and asshole in the copy machine,  and I still got in trouble for a Christmas party.  Frankie Blue, why? 
[03:25:30]  Well, I needed the money.  Oh, that's terrific.  Frankie Blue in there.  Yeah, that's terrific.  Frankie Blue his job up.  Welcome to WH-IV.  Wait, wait.  That's just people that enjoy this music.  Come on.  Let's dance, baby.  Let's dance.  Hey, I just said that.  I'd like to take Donna Summer and fuck Donna Summer.  Donna Summer.  Yeah, here on KCU.  We got our big contest going.  We're going to win it.  Sky on Earth. 
[03:26:00]  What are we winning?  I don't know.  Tune in to Frankie Blue for the next five minutes,  because that's all I'll be here before they throw my drunk ass out.  And RuPaul's going to take his big manly hands and freeze into Donna Summer's box.  I mean, what a mess he was at that.  I'm going to do a little riff, you know, because I'm Frankie Blue.  You know, we got RuPaul in here.  I was in the bathroom.  What a huge horse cock on that black guy.  Let me tell you. 
[03:26:30]  What a huge horse cock.  What?  Are we on the arrow?  Uh-oh.  And you know the station, the on-air talent, did not address it honestly.  You know they didn't goof on it once it happened.  Just don't talk about it.  Just pretend it didn't happen.  Make believe it didn't happen until we fire you.  That's pretty much what radio does.  Well, because we said it earlier.  I mean, they've taken the fun out of radio.  Everyone has taken this whole thing so seriously.  No spontaneity.  It's just radio.  It's the stupidest job in America.  Yeah.  And no one has a sense of humor anymore. 
[03:27:00]  If this happens on your radio station, you've got to go with it.  I agree with you, baby.  Frankie Blue agrees with you.  Corporate people are talentless, humorless faggots,  and they ruin everything they touch that is creative.  Yeah.  Every time corporations get involved with creativity, you ruin it.  Shut up!  Oh, sorry.  Try to soak everybody.  Outer!  Flashback.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, baby.  On the new KTU.  How long has this station been around?  Why do we still call it new?  Cranky Blue here. 
[03:27:30]  Get me another goddamn drink.  Woo, Blue.  You're my boy.  Oh, that's me.  You're not funny.  You're not interesting.  And that's why when things like this happen,  you don't know what to do with it.  You just clam up and pretend it didn't happen.  Fire it.  96 was when they were the new KTU.  All right.  They still call themselves the new.  So there's the Frankie Blue update.  He got fired for the audio we're about to play.  So he yells and screams at the poor girl that was supposed to be on the air,  whatever her name is.  She's some legend, too, I guess. 
[03:28:00]  Whatever.  She still got a job there?  I guess.  Yeah.  I thought maybe they'd just eliminate the entire problem.  You know, sometimes just flush it out, make like it never happened.  We don't have to look at her.  We don't have to think about him.  You know, they kind of do that sometimes.  But I'm sure she would sue.  Oh, yeah.  Probably rightfully so.  Someone says he manhandled her.  I don't know if he did or not.  He shoved her out.  I have some respect for him now.  I would, too.  I'm going to show her who's boss.  Something used to be.  He thought he was big enough.  Show her who used to be boss.  He thought he was big enough to go on the air and do a radio shift. 
[03:28:30]  And we got our hands on the audio.  Yeah, baby.  Here's Frankie Blue blowing up his career, baby.  Here it is.  End of the day.  I love this song.  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been...  giving you a chance to win $50,000 in cash in the Mix 1027 redo and plus win a Toyota Scion. 
[03:29:00]  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like publishing clearance. 
[03:29:30]  And whether it's a job or it's a house or it's a job.  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you.  And we're going to reward you with $50,000 in a brand new Toyota.  And I don't see how you cannot be happy about that.  This is Frankie Blue.  So make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m., 50 grand prize winner. 
[03:30:00]  50 grand prize winner.  That's terrific.  That's right.  That's terrific.  50 grand prize winner of the redo contest of the winner of the Toyota Scion.  Come on, baby.  You know you want it.  If you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul is going to dip his big old hands in there, pick the winner, and we're going to find you. 
[03:30:30]  And I don't care if it takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right.  We have the armored truck.  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town.  So why don't you give me a call?  This is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez.  And the telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-MIX-1027. 
[03:31:00]  You're just a tool.  Okay, baby?  Thank you.  He's the boss.  I can't get past that.  Okay, baby.  And I don't know anybody who would not want to do this.  What a drunk.  Dude, we are really lucky that Earl got us that thing.  That is so cool.  Black Earl.  Earl, you got us the tape, right?  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, he doesn't know anything about it.  Denying it to the end.  All right, Earl.  And then here's the second part that we have where he basically, we're not sure if he wants  to fuck the winner of this contest or if he was hiccuping.  And then he's using the wrong call letters for his radio station and he's the boss.  More fired than fired.  He's so fired.  So completely fired that you are fired before anyone even knows you're fired. 
[03:32:00]  So fired.  This is just all about being so fired.  So completely and thoroughly fired.  And he did get fired while we were in Vegas.  But this is what did him in.  Yeah, I agree with Jim.  We know how they work over there.  The other one, you could get behind closed doors to yell at you like, what are you doing?  You idiot.  We know how they operate over there.  Me and Opie are the pros of knowing when you're fired.  We just know.  We know when other jocks do things, like we'll read it on the internet or something or in 
[03:32:30]  the paper, some jock screws up in some market out in the Midwest.  And me and Opie are on the phone with each other just going, dude, did you read that?  Oh, yeah.  Dude, fired.  So fired.  This guy is so fired.  And you're reading the paper.  No, they just removed him from the air, suspended him.  They said for a week.  And me and Opie are like, fired.  Fired.  Fired.  So fired.  And at the end of the week, fired.  So fired.  We know.  So here it is.  This is what doomed him.  Mix 1027.  The new Mix 1027. 
[03:33:00]  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky and Rue.  Oh.  Coming in in the morning.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Putting their hand in the big old barrel and picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest. 
[03:33:30]  And also you win a Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull,  they're going to put their hand in the barrel,  they're going to pick out a winner,  and then they're going to fight that winner.  Okay, terrific.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 1027, Frankie Blue, what's happening?  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening to you. 
[03:34:00]  Bye-bye.  I can't wait until tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  What was that?  How drunk do you have to be when you're doing the Foster Brooks impression?  Tomorrow.  You know, Dean.  What a mess.  That got him thrown right out.  So that's the end of that soap opera.  Frankie Blue is done. 
[03:34:30]  Frankie Blue.  We've been having so much fun with that audio, too, man.  It's one of my favorite things.  The worst of O and A on high voltage.  Don't stop tweeting.  I don't want to.  XM 202.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lo más mal de Opie and Anthony en XM2.  Zero dos.  Anthony, look who went to the studio.  Jim Norton.  It's Jimmy.  That's right.  We're in the middle of worst of because we're all on vacation.  Yes, we are.  Where are you, Jimmy, on vacation? 
[03:35:00]  I'm in Los Angeles right now.  Ooh.  Filming the pilot for HBO with Louis C.K. and the rest of the crew.  How's it going?  Very well so far.  They're actually thinking of giving me my own series.  My acting has been so good.  Wow.  Yeah.  Congrats.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony, we know you're on a cruise.  I'm on a cruise.  I'm in the Caribbean right now.  Ooh.  And we're taping this about four days before vacation.  Yeah.  I'm just praying that I figured out what I was going to do for vacation.  Oh, you still don't know?  Well, at this point, I'm hoping I know. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, true.  Because I'm doing it.  Right.  You're on it right now.  God, I hope I pick something cool, man.  Because as we tape this four days before vacation, I still have no vacation planned.  Look where you are right now, though.  It's pretty cool.  You think?  Yeah, look.  I'm not in my apartment by myself, right?  Look around right now.  Take a second.  Look.  It's pretty good, right?  No, because I would never go on vacation with you.  No, I'm just talking to you.  Oh, oh.  You're not with Anthony.  Through the MiFi.  Oh, oh.  Like, again, you're listening to the MiFi.  You're on vacation right now as we speak.  Okay.  I'm coming through the speaker. 
[03:36:00]  Okay.  And I'm telling you, look around.  Not now.  Oh, oh.  You're looking.  You're on mic.  You're looking around.  Now, wherever you are, you're looking around going, yeah, this is pretty cool.  Right.  I hope.  You see one chair and a mouse.  Guess where you are.  I'll let everyone know where I went on vacation when I get back April 11th.  I hope I pick something cool, man.  The tease.  It's another assault on the media as you listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This was huge for us. 
[03:36:30]  We just made asses of ourselves in front of Good Morning America.  Right now, Anthony's having a good time on a boat watching an 80-year-old Jew be pushed  off the side in a wheelchair.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Holy S.  I'm having my baby in the microwave.  Wow.  Holy S.  We're getting major exposure on Good Morning America.  Wow.  Holy S.  Opie and Anthony XM.  Oh, my God.  Nice job, Eric.  Eric.  You got it?  Nice. 
[03:37:00]  Keep going.  Keep doing it.  Holy S.  Wow.  Keep doing it.  Hold on.  Wow.  Hold on.  Stay there.  Wow.  More important than the tsunami.  Oh, my.  Bye-bye, old people.  Oh, there they go again.  Wow.  There's two less Christmas gifts.  Holy S.  Those guys are going wow, too.  We just spent an hour of the show just wasting time, but Eric got the job done.  There he is.  Hold it up.  Hold it up.  Right there.  It's perfect.  Hold the other one up.  Anthony, wow, XM Satellite Radio.  Huge sign.  Good job.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Get the other one up. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  There's our stupid faces.  Got our dopey faces.  Oh, Eric is the best.  This is how you do assault on the media.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Now, one of them, you can only see one of them.  Take the other one and put it a little more center.  There you go.  Very nice.  Excellent job.  Great.  Keep spinning the sign.  Keep spinning the sign.  Yeah, keep spinning it just to annoy them.  Major exposure on it.  Good morning, America.  Yes.  Major.  Wow.  Fantastic.  There they are again. 
[03:38:00]  Move over, Lil.  Move over.  There's one of them.  He's got to move over.  Oh, they're trying to move the camera.  Just follow the camera.  Don't let them hide.  Oh, who's this old broad?  Oh, wow.  Right behind.  What has she got?  I don't know.  What does she got?  This is ABC, by the way.  It's 50 years and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Hey, only one sign is in frame.  Move the other sign.  All right.  What happened, Eric?  Police are asking me to take the sign down.  Oh, stop it.  Why?  What is it, terrorism?  The ABC page? 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  Making sure.  It's not illegal.  It's okay.  It's not illegal.  The cops are cool.  He's a big fan, but we've got to take it down.  The ABC people are really complaining to the cops.  But it's not illegal.  Why do they?  How could they complain?  The lady's holding one right there.  Yeah, that's a sign, too.  The cops are being cool.  He's like, hey, guys, I like it.  Could you just be cool and take it down?  I said, can I hold it up?  And he just looked at me.  He's like, no, please take it down.  You know what?  We've got major exposure.  All right.  Good enough.  Good job.  Don't mess with the cop, man.  Just do what he says.  If the cop's a fan and all that, don't mess with him.  Yeah, you can't.  No, no, no. 
[03:39:00]  Like I said, the cop was real cool, so I took it down.  The pit is pissed from ABC.  Good.  The cop was pissed.  Oh, dude.  Stupid ABC.  Good job, man.  That'll be up on our website.  That was major exposure.  It wasn't just a little flash, man.  It was a big part of the TV.  That was huge.  That's so great.  Here we go on Instant Feedback.  Sam from Kentucky.  I just seen the wow signs.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Home run.  Awesome.  Excellent.  Mike from Orlando.  You're on the TV.  Signs everywhere.  It just goes on and on, Anthony. 
[03:39:30]  All right.  We're coming back.  Great job, man.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Bravo.  Great job today, man.  Oh, man.  All right.  There he goes, Eric.  Very good.  The Hawk has struck again, Anthony.  The Hawk.  Good job.  Major freaking exposure.  Jeff from Jersey.  F-ing beautiful, guys.  He knows how it works.  Yeah.  It just goes on and on and on.  Both signs were in frame for a while, too.  I hope the interns learn from Eric and realize how it's done. 
[03:40:00]  Danny's good, too, though.  Danny was part of that.  Yeah, no, I know.  Danny did a great job, too, helping out Eric today.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here, but we heard the radio  show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, the ladies of the evening, which is  a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs. 
[03:40:30]  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour, and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just am thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling. 
[03:41:00]  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother, and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything's falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But, anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But, anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas, and I really hope you can make it.  And, anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie? 
[03:41:30]  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's in my shoes.  Ramone, clean this up.  Gift shop, this is Jackie.  Hello, this is Ronald Reagan.  I was wondering if Nancy was there.  I need a change, and I've got to load my pants as big as the Lincoln Memorial.  You were wondering if Nancy was here? 
[03:42:00]  Yes.  No, not today.  She won't be here until Wednesday.  Oh, geez.  By Wednesday, my depends will be messier than the seat in JFK's limo.  Why don't you talk to my manager?  Hang on just a moment.  Okay.  Hello.  Hello, this is Ronald Reagan.  I'm just calling the gift shop wondering, well, what's the hottest selling item there?  Your autobiography in American Life. 
[03:42:30]  I wrote that?  Uh-huh.  You wrote that.  When the hell did I do that?  I don't know.  When did you do that?  I don't know.  Well...  Uh-huh.  I've met you before.  Was I nice?  You were very nice.  I don't remember.  Did you have a nice ass?  I don't know.  I remember a good ass when I see one.  You know, Nancy used to have a nice ass.  Now it looks like two big heads of cauliflower.  Do you have big breasts? 
[03:43:00]  Uh, no.  Do they look like the top of the Capitol building?  Because I like big breasts.  I like the ones on Ted Kennedy.  Hello?  Wait a second here.  Yes, this is Ronald Reagan.  Yes, you sound just like him.  I want to know if...  Well, my wife Nancy has stopped in yet.  Yes.  Well, maybe you better check...  Let me have you check with our cashier.  She might have seen her.  Jeez.  Old Ron's getting the run around like the Pope in an abortion clinic. 
[03:43:30]  My friend?  Hello?  Hello.  Hi, this is Ronald Reagan.  Yes.  I'm looking for Mommy.  Is Nancy there?  No, she'll be here Wednesday.  One thing good about Alzheimer's, you meet new people every day.  Yeah, I know.  Would you like to talk to Sally?  I want a Big Mac and a large fry.  Oh, you do?  Okay, you want me to transfer you to Sally?  Yes, can I speak with Sally?  Yeah, hang on just a second.  I'll transfer you upstairs. 
[03:44:00]  This is Sally.  Can I help you?  Hello, Sally.  Yes.  Hi, this is Ron Reagan.  And, well, I was just wondering if Nancy was there.  No, I'm sorry, Ron.  She isn't here right now.  We do expect her shortly, though.  Yes, I just wanted to ask her if this year I can hide my own Easter eggs.  Because I probably, well, won't remember quite where I put them.  Yeah, I can pass on that message to her. 
[03:44:30]  Uh-oh.  I'm getting stiffer than Richard Nixon.  Really?  Yes, it's a horrible thing.  Have you seen my daughter in Playboy?  No, I wouldn't see that.  Have I met you?  Mm-hmm.  Several times.  Mm-hmm.  It was a pleasure meeting you.  Did you have nice cans?  I think you're getting a little absurd now, okay?  Absurd?  That's sexual harassment.  I'm sorry.  No, it's Alzheimer's. 
[03:45:00]  This is the end.  What are you talking about?  Of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, okay.  Catch Opie and Anthony live from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. Eastern  with replays throughout the day on XM 202.  Want more?  Go to opiananthony.com.  No. </pre>
