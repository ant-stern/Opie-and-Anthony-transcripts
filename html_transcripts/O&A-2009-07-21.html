<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious reaction to Whoopi Goldberg's questioning of the moon landing.  Opie and Anthony vehemently denied her claims, resorting to insults and vulgar language,  suggesting her skepticism was rooted in racial bias.  They celebrated Buzz Aldrin punching a moon landing conspiracy theorist and even suggested Aldrin should do the same to Whoopi Goldberg. The hosts used the movie *Capricorn One* to further mock Goldberg's stance. This transitioned into a heated internal dispute about Steve, a producer, who had vaguely requested time off on Mondays, leading to misinterpretations and accusations of poor communication.  The hosts and staff debated the meaning of his email, with Steve defending his intentions against accusations of deliberate misrepresentation and the hosts citing the disruption to their workflow. Steve also alleged a hostile work environment characterized by constant antagonism ("Lord of the Flies"-style), while the staff disputed this, leading to a discussion of specific incidents including a cancelled guest appearance and a lack of communication surrounding its cancellation,  leaving the issue unresolved but with an agreement to improve communication.  The missing email concerning the cancelled guest was promised to be discussed later.  This was followed by light banter about Alanis Morissette's appearance.

The show continued with a discussion about the communication breakdown surrounding the cancelled guest appearance, with more criticism of Steve's communication style and perceived lack of responsibility.  This segment also included various unrelated topics such as the leaked Erin Andrews nude video and its ethical implications, Tom Watson's performance in the British Open and potential PGA age restrictions, Brian Kilmeade's racially insensitive comments about interspecies marriage, the firing of Todd and Don for using the term "wetback," a staff member's messy bowel movement, and a listener's call about Lupus and its disproportionate effect on black women.

The next segment focused on recently fired or suspended radio personalities and their apologies.  The firings of Mike Martinez, Pryor and Jeffries, and Todd and Don (for using "wetback") were discussed, along with the suicide of Martin Streak after his firing.  Brian Kilmeade's apology was played and mocked.  A video of a radio station mocking gay construction workers was also discussed, along with the ensuing apologies and controversy.  The hosts debated the offensiveness of "wetback" and expressed skepticism towards political correctness.  They also discussed Phil Collins' song "It's No Fun Being an Illegal Alien," Adam Yauch's cancer diagnosis, Joe Jackson (and Larry King's interview with him), and the construction of Lego figures.

The final segment started with a discussion of insincere radio apologies, followed by commentary on Wendy Williams' physical appearance and the numerous gay men on her show, leading to graphic discussions about male genitalia and self-pleasure.  The hosts heavily criticized a male guest on Wendy Williams' show, focusing on his numerous moles with highly offensive language.  This transitioned to a Bob Dylan clip and a biographical anecdote about a crooked mayor.  They then mocked a Joe Jackson interview on Larry King Live, criticizing King's interviewing style and questioning Joe Jackson's alleged involvement in Michael Jackson's death.  This was followed by further commentary on Linda Carter, renewed attacks on the "mole man," and continued criticism of Larry King, along with highly offensive and sexually charged comments about various celebrities, including Wendy Williams, Lisa Rinna, and Jessica Simpson. The show concluded abruptly with the hosts' departing remarks.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts and staff frequently used vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah  Wowie  Ha  Wowie  Must be sexy Tuesday  Opie and Anthony  Whoopi Goldberg says that the moon landing was fake  What the  I'll repeat  Whoopi Goldberg says the moon landing was fake 
[00:00:30]  What an asshole  On a day  The 40th anniversary of the landing  And this dummy's got to come out  And instead of giving credit where credit's due  To brave men  And  Engineers  And just the will of  Humanity to be able to pull something like that off  The real deal  Not a farce  And she's got to say she  She doesn't believe it 
[00:01:00]  Or  Has her doubts  Or whatever her words were  She's not a smart woman  You know  She just isn't a smart woman  I thought she was smarter than this  Anyone who has their doubts  You could go off on every little thing  The way the flag is  The shadows  There's no stars  There's this that that  Everything's been proven  They've said this is why this  They've always given an explanation  But more than anything else  If you could pull off the biggest scam  In history  Which is convincing the world 
[00:01:30]  That we went to the moon  Why would you then try to pull the same scam off  Six more times  Because we didn't get on the moon the first time  And we now had a  Why would you scam it six more times  Successfully by the way  Yeah  Except for you know Apollo 13  Or five more times  It kept people's minds off  I believe it was fake  It kept people's minds off  The Russians and the situation with the Soviets  It gave Americans something to feel good about  Is that what it did?  The Soviets were doing better in the space race  Yeah  Really?  Yeah  They were at that point? 
[00:02:00]  By 69?  Yes  Okay  They had prettier rockets  The rockets suck  The rockets  The Vostok  The Vostok  The rockets were painted like party hats  It looked fun  It's funny you say that  Because their stupid rockets looked like party hats  Dumb Russians  Our stuff was the shit  It was great  And there were great men behind it  Neil Armstrong is a great man  Of course he is  Buzz Aldrin's a great man  Yes  Mr. Collins is a great man  Yes  I like Mr. Collins 
[00:02:30]  He might be an asshole to Jimmy  But you know you gotta give it to Buzz  Buzz Aldrin  He went there  He likes to punch people  Yeah  I got that clip  A bunch of people that say he should punch Whoopi in the face  Well before the Whoopi thing from yesterday  Because it's an oldie but goodie  Oh yeah  The clip of Buzz Aldrin punching moon landing conspiracy guy in the face  Frankie Buzz  How long ago was that?  I don't know man  Maybe a couple of years right?  Yeah  Or five years  Yeah I don't think it's that foreign to the past  No 
[00:03:00]  You're the one who said you walked on the moon when you didn't  Calling the kettle black if I ever thought of saying I misrepresented myself  Can you get it away from me?  You're a coward and a liar and a thief  And a thief  Buzz just whacked them  A coward and a liar  Who's the little jerk off?  He's another one of these asshole fucking conspiracy know-it-all douches  Oh god  It's disgusting  I'm so happy Buzz punched that guy in the face  Buzz popped him one  He popped him good 
[00:03:30]  No fuck with Buzz Aldrin  Ever  Even that old codger now will still fuck you up  Cracking a head  That kook  Wouldn't it be great if Buzz Aldrin walked onto the View set today and just punched Whoopi  Just punch his Whoopi square in her big fat ugly fucking face  And then there'll be a racist incident  Of course  He'd be held on a race crime  Whoopi on the View wonders if the moon landing was fake  Wonders  How do you wonder something like that?  She's on a national TV show trying to educate broads 
[00:04:00]  And this is what came out of her mouth yesterday  I don't think we're going to be spending money without a lot  But there are also questions to be answered  You know I'm a fan of the movie Capricorn One  Which says and it's just  Capricorn One  You mean the movie with O.J. Simpson?  And Mr. fucking Barbara Streisand?  That movie?  And the guy that does the TD Waterhouse commercials now?  Is she going to get her knowledge from a movie?  Are you out of your fucking bird Whoopi? 
[00:04:30]  God she's stupid  You know how about we say slavery never happened?  Let's then see Whoopi go off  Oh shit  What if we said that?  What if we said slavery never happened?  I don't know I didn't see any pictures  I don't see any photographs  But what are you talking about?  Well she would say you're crazy  Of course she would  But there's a lot more proof that the moon landing happened  Shut up Whoopi you fucking asshole  Whoa chill  Whoa  I'm sorry  Someone forgot to do a little younger this morning 
[00:05:00]  I can't stand when  Ohm  Things like this come up  Oh no oming  Oh a little crazy this morning  Capricorn One  Which says  And it's just a movie  Okay it was made  It's a Hollywood movie  Which kind of puts in question  Whether it happened  Whether the moon walk  Actually did happen  I like the movie  Because I think it's fun to watch  But there are a couple questions  That was fucking  The movie was Capricorn One  And it was going to Mars  And they realized that the life support system 
[00:05:30]  Wouldn't work  Because like  They cut some costs somewhere  And they realized  Look the astronauts  You guys would be dead  Within like a few weeks  So they decided to fake the whole thing  To keep the money coming into the space program  That was the basis of Capricorn One  Not going to the moon  Based on a true story  No  Based on a load of bullshit  And O.J. Simpson the murderer was in it  Oh by the way  I don't think he did it  Shut up whooping  Has she come around and said that too  I'm sure she did 
[00:06:00]  I'm just going to go on record as saying  I'm sure she did  Why because it's her place  As a black woman  Exactly  It's her place  To dismiss white achievements  And just fucking overblow black achievements  I'm sorry  That's her job  Could we get whoopee on the show today  She called us one other time  She should never come back on this show  After we beat her down  When did we beat her down  Over the Imus thing  It was over Imus  Where she  We beat her down pretty good 
[00:06:30]  She hung up on us  Look I know a lot of black people  Are involved behind the scenes  And stuff  As far as the Apollo program went  But for the love of god  It was three white guys  That's why she's upset  Give me a break  Give me a god damn break  If there was a black astronaut on the moon  She wouldn't be saying shit  Another racist  Another race baiter  This view is embarrassing to women  I'm starting to think  There's a lot of dummies on that program  It is  A lot of dummies  It's fun to watch  But there are a couple of questions  That I do have from time to time 
[00:07:00]  Who shot the footage?  Cause you see the two astronauts  They had a cameraman up there  Floating around  You are a dumb  Fucking ass  Is she doing that for like  Like a laugh  Or is she serious?  I don't know  If you heard that from a comedian  It would be kind of funny on a stage  Where was the camera?  Is she going for the laugh  Or is she being serious?  I don't know  We'll find out  But hey dummy  The camera was on a boom  First of all  They had a couple of cameras  That came out of the lunar module  On booms  To catch 
[00:07:30]  They knew it was going to be  A huge moment in history  They knew that  So they had one  Pointing at the god damn ladder  They knew that  Maybe future generations  Are going to want to take a peek at this  Come down the god damn ladder  So they said  Alright you know what  We need to get some cameras  Out there somewhere  And then the other thing  She says is stupid  From what I've heard  I haven't heard this yet  So let me hear what she says  Alright  Cause you see the two astronauts  You never see the  You think the third guy  Would go like  Yeah but you would think  He would have turned around  And gone like this 
[00:08:00]  So we knew it was him  The third guy  Who was in the capsule  And who was shooting  In the capsule  Listen how stupid  These dumb  Fucking bitches sound  There were only two guys  In the lunar module  The third guy  Was flying the command module  Around the moon  Waiting for them  To come back  The camera  Is on a boom  On the lunar module  There's a couple of them  The other cameras  Were strapped to the  Astronauts chests 
[00:08:30]  They weren't movable  They aimed them  By moving around  And looking  And taking pictures  That way  There was no viewfinder  But they had trained  So they knew exactly  How to stand  And where to look  To take pictures  Plus you don't see  How many bad pictures  Might have been taken  Exactly  We're seeing all the  Great ones  And the horrible pictures  These are the ones  They chose  We don't see the ones  Where Buzz is coming  Out of the bathroom  Butting his pants  Where with a half  The half that  Like helmet is in the frame  Yeah yeah  Blurry shot 
[00:09:00]  Something like that  These dummies  Are arguing the point  Because she thinks  There's a third astronaut  On the fucking moon  Wandering around  Taking these pictures  Plus they knew  Where to stand  They weren't going to  Go out of camera range  For the most part  It wasn't important  They trained  To put the flag  In a position  They trained for all this  There's actually  Mission Control  Says  Could you  Get in frame  With the flag  Right  He tells Buzz Aldrin 
[00:09:30]  I believe  To get in there  So they have that shot  The pictures  Were very important  To the mission  The flag  It was very windy  Up there  That day  Yeah yeah  The flag was waving  That's what I hear  Don't you think  This is the thing  If they had a third guy  As a photographer  Don't you think  They would have caught that  Like if it was a big space  And they were able  To orchestrate  All this stuff  And you know  And bouncing it off  Through Australia  Do you think  Someone would have said  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  We have a camera guy  That we're not accounting for  They would have went 
[00:10:00]  Oh golly  That's an excellent point  We never even thought  Now we're fucked  The cameraman  Who took the pictures  We didn't think of that  And there's also a 7-Eleven  In the background  Can you remove that  Oh golly  We didn't think of that  Well dummies  You know there's a special  I watch  A guy who says  About faking the moon landing  And it is very  When you watch it  You're like  Oh my god  It's a really good special  And I can see why  Watching that  Would make you go  What the fuck  Maybe it was fake  Because it was so well done  The special  But then you  When you see the 9-11 shit 
[00:10:30]  You can say the same thing  But then you get a little  Knowledge on the other side  And go okay this is completely ridiculous  You can make anything look like  Holy crap  This is harder stuff  To debunk though  Meaning  Because he's talking about  Photographic evidence  And he has a guy from Kodak  Who's a legitimate guy  Saying I actually don't know  How that was done  There are certain things  We all watch 9-11 happen  This is a more convincing argument  But when you watch it debunked  By people who know  What they're talking about  Then you go  Oh okay that's it  That's what I'm saying  When you get a little knowledge 
[00:11:00]  The other way  I just don't know enough  To debunk it  Yeah when you see it  One side  It's like  Oh wow  Wow real  Really  You learn that half the shit  They're just making up  To make their story better  And then it's like  Wow that worked  The first time  At Apollo 11  We actually did it  Okay  Now let's try with 12  Let's try with 13  We'll throw a disaster  In that one  That'll be fun  Then we'll go 14  15  16  And 17  And we'll fake all of those  And hopefully  No one will catch on  Why wouldn't they just do it once  And go  Oh my god 
[00:11:30]  We got away with it  Well  Scrap it  Well if we did fake it  Where did the rocket go  Until it was time  To bring the rocket back down  Yeah that's  A good question  That's a lot of  Big Saturn  Right  It launched  Everyone saw it  Alright alright  We're going to launch  This big massive thing  And then we're going to  Move into a Hollywood studio  And then we're going to  Like watch it fall  From the sky  Where did they get  David Copperfield's father  To help out  With the fucking  And nobody talked  Conspiracy  And again  And not one person  Nobody talked  None of the light guys 
[00:12:00]  None of the boom guys  Let's look at the  Akele assassination people  No one in the  Dallas police department  Talked  No one  A lot of people died  From JFK  I've also read  That was a myth too though  I've also read  That was a myth as well  When I saw it on TV  For the first time  I believed it  Because there was no one  On the other side  Saying well that was a myth  Yep  Here's Whoopi continuing  Great  Whoopi  And that old tag  Barbara Walters  Kind of arguing  Saying that there was  The guy in a capsule  Taking pictures  The fool  Yes  They went to a photo  March  There was a guy 
[00:12:30]  No the other guy  Was hovering  And going around the moon  Everybody knows that  He was sleeping  Except for these hens  He was the only poor  Bastard  That couldn't watch it  He was probably the only guy  That couldn't watch  The moon landing  Was Collins  He was just up there  They should turn the view  Into a cooking show  Just have these  Dopes cook stuff  For an hour  Michael Collins  They said when he was  Behind the moon  Was the most isolated man  In history  For that time  Because no man  Had ever been that far  From other humans 
[00:13:00]  Wouldn't you jerk off  I don't know what I would do  Jerk off  Why not  My dick wouldn't work  Who's catching you  You're on the dark side  Of the moon  Isolated  You couldn't communicate  With the earth  Yeah  I would panic  That is kind of crazy  They have that  Loss of signal period  Where they can't communicate  Dude you're the most  Isolated man in history  Cut off  It's like walking  Through the woods at night  Yeah  Trying to get to the other side  Where it's light again  He's just like  Yeah  He's just like  That feeling times a million  I'm really far away  Oh my god  I have no contact 
[00:13:30]  With anybody  I'm just going to wait  And hopefully  When I pop out the other side  The world's still there  I bet you guarantee  He was talking  The whole like  Five minutes early  Hello  Hello  Hello  Mr. Control  Mr. Control  Hello  Mr. Control  Hello  And then finally  He hears them  And the relief  He must have felt  Mr. Control  I'm back in contact  Mr. Control  Yeah  Here's Whoopi  Columbia  Mr. Control  Columbia  Whoopi's still questioning  Barbara Walters  Arguing  But you never see  Well then you don't really doubt  That the men 
[00:14:00]  Landed in the movie  I am just saying  That there are wonderful  They don't have to take  There are wonderful  You know I love  Great conspiracy theories  And these  And these  Are better than a lot of them  Because they say  Where  Why is the  The flag rippling  There's no  That fucking flag rippling thing  Annoys the living piss out of me  That's why I just gotta laugh  Yeah like  If you're gonna have a huge  Conspiracy theory  You're gonna  You're gonna  You're gonna forget  The flag thing  The flag 
[00:14:30]  Fucking idiot  We'll put a big fan on them  So the flag stands  Straight out  And ripples  Right  I mean it's  It's on  A lever  The goddamn thing is on  Like an L bracket  Because there's no wind  It doesn't stand out  So they wanted it  To stand out  Because they wanted it  To show the world  It was America  So when they put it in there  It jiggled around  And actually did move  It's moving  Because he's moving it  Right  There's still gravity  There's still forces  Of physics  If you twist something 
[00:15:00]  If you torque the bar  That the flag is on  That other L bar  Is gonna move  And when it moves  It's good  It has momentum  Which it's gonna swing back  One way  And the other  And the other  Until it stops  At some point  But it won't stop in space  Because there's no air  To slow it down  Right  There's less resistance  To stopping something like that  So it'll go back and forth  For a while  But these idiots  You can't just put a limp flag  On the moon  If you're gonna be  The first one there  You gotta make sure  The world sees 
[00:15:30]  What the flag is  So they thought about that  Ahead of time  Unbelievable  It's like if you stand  On the shuttle  Fucking idiot  The shuttle is moving  17,000 miles an hour  And yet you can climb  Out of the hatch  And stand on it  Right  And you don't get blown off  Because there's no wind  You couldn't stand on the roof  If you want a bagel  If it was doing 90  And the guy was yelling  What the fuck  Inside of it  Yeah  They're thousands of miles an hour  And they're just kind of  You know  Hey I'm here  Fixing the Hubble  Yeah  Zipping around the Earth  They just  Oh wait  Which one Ant 
[00:16:00]  Oh that one  Oh  You know  This one  Like there was another word  In his head  Are you crazy  How about this  Whoopi is  Whoopi's  Whoopi has a bunch of  Mal information  About the moon landing  We think  Oh we think  That's difficult  That's difficult for everybody  How about it  Buzz Aldrin  Teabags  Whoopi  That's a good one  That's a good one  What is it  Buzz Aldrin  Teabags  Whoopi 
[00:16:30]  Oh fuck  Alright boys  You heard it  You heard it  Alright let it rip people  Let it rip  Please make this number one  Buzz Aldrin  Teabags  Whoopi  I don't think either one of them  Would like that  Whoopi  Whoopi spelled  W-H-O-O-P-I  Right  Here we go  God that is good  Here's more Whoopi  And these  Are better than a lot of them  Because they say  Why is the  Flag rippling  There's no air  They touched it supposedly 
[00:17:00]  Yes but if it was  Is it  Is it  In a  Is it always in a ripple  Was it starched in a ripple  I don't know  Because it should  Because a flag would be like this  Right  I was just told in my ear  That there have been  Six moon landings  So if you think  The first was a hoax  We've had five  We did  We just didn't care  Thirty five percent of Brits  Do not believe that  That happened  And only six percent of Americans  There are people  Who don't believe  There are people  Who don't believe  The holocaust happened  There are people  Who still are questioning  The assassination 
[00:17:30]  Of John Kennedy  There are always people  Who love conspiracies  And that makes it fun  She just stinks  Well at least the old broad  Was throwing a little sense in there  A little bit  Out of her loony head  Come on Whoopi  You're smarter than that  Whoopi is just  Whoopi is an idiot  I think  I don't even  I don't think she's out now  Denying it  I think she said  I like a good conspiracy  I think people like  To throw themselves  Into these things  They are fun  To look like  You're uncovering  This mystery  That everybody  It's like when you look at it  You almost want it  To be fake  Because then you'll be 
[00:18:00]  On the side  That figured it out  Oh yeah  Yeah well  You know it's not  I think most people  But you're on the side  That like  Is sounding like an asshole  You are  Is what  You're not on the side  That's looking like  Wow look what I uncovered  You're on the side  That just sounds like an asshole  An uninformed douche  Which she sounded like  Even though she  She kind of glazed it over  A little bit by saying  I like a good conspiracy there  But she was actually  Bringing up these points  That perpetuate  The whole fucking thing  Absolutely  You know 
[00:18:30]  I'm offended by you  Whoopi  I'm offended  Buzz Aldrin  Tea bags  Whoopi  There you go  Google bomb  Google bomb  Google it  God that guy annoyed me  When he called Buzz Aldrin  A coward and a liar  Oh god  Really is annoying  That's still annoying me  Just listening to that brat  He got his  Yeah he really did get  A fistful of knuckle  A fistful of knuckle  Good  He's not going to listen  To that crap  God bless him  Garbage  Oh that annoys me  You want to hear it again  Yeah  This guy is everything I hate  About a conspiracy theorist 
[00:19:00]  I like his  Last word  When he gets  Some Aldrin knuckles  He didn't just question him  The bottom line is  He was like a little child  Yelling at mommy  That's what he reminds me  That's what these guys  Always remind me of  He's little babies  Little brats  You're the one who  Said you walked on the moon  When you didn't  Calling the kettle black  If you ever thought of  Saying I misrepresented  My way from me  You're a coward  And a liar  And a thief  And a thief  And a thief  Good  Yeah  I'm a thief  I just stole your dignity 
[00:19:30]  Did that  Yeah there's uh  It's actually videotaped  Yeah  Wow right in the face  Oh does he clock him  One  God damn buzz  Look at him  Bam  A nice right hand  Right to that  Fucking idiot's face  Let's see that again  This is on the video  Oh brilliant  Let's say hi to Rob  Rob you're in Jersey  You're on the  O.B. and Anthony show  What's up Rob  Hey guys  Hey  Oh buzz  What a shot  That is  Sorry  Sorry dude  We can't get over 
[00:20:00]  What a great  Fucking chin  What a chin music  From buzz  Nice  He's got a nice  Right hook huh  Why don't we just  All talk to the same  The guy is taller  Than buzz  Yeah  So buzz  Fucking just  Punches up  What a fucking  Pow  That guy's  That guy's a man  That guy's head  Snap back  Rob it's your turn  Go  Did you guys see  This week  NASA apparently  Lost all the  Original films  Of the moon landing  Yeah what's that about  They digaussed them  And reused them 
[00:20:30]  And when questioned  About it  One of the guys  From NASA  Said yeah  We should have  Had that story  And follow us  Around because  We didn't really  Think that was  Important  Why would you  Reuse  Yeah right  What fucking  Bums  I don't know  I heard  There was some  Tapes that were  Like telemetry  Tapes from  Australia  Things like that  But the film  Itself  I don't know  Is that missing  There's copies of it  But the originals  Are missing  But everything  That was made 
[00:21:00]  Was copied  Yeah  I've heard things  Back and forth too  I'm not sure  What to believe  As far as that  But  Well it came out  A couple days ago  Is it true or not  It doesn't necessarily  Mean that it never  Happened  It was one  They said it was  One of 200,000  Tapes that was  Taped over  And what happens  Is and again  This is not a good  Comparison  But a lot of the  Original tonight shows  Were lost  Like lost forever  There were no copies  Of them  Honeymooners  Never happened  They were taped  Johnny Carson  Was fake  Right  It was a robot  Built by Disney  They were taped  Over to save money  They just didn't 
[00:21:30]  Know any better  Yeah  It's with everything  That's why  Those old baseball  Cards were so much  Because back  Back then  People just didn't  Think it was  Going to be worth  Anything  You know what I mean  History is called  History  Right  Because when it's  Happening  You're not quite sure  It's history  Well I'm sure they knew  It was a monumental  Thing  It probably was  Mislabeled  Or probably just  Got put in the  Wrong bin  Or somebody just  Misread something  And actually  Saw  Okay these are  Just tapes  That are good  No man  We missed something  That Barbara  Walter said  Ian on Long Island 
[00:22:00]  Ian  Hey guys  Happy birthday  Jimmy  Hey  Oh no  Thank you  Start that all over  What member of  Kiss is coming in  Today  Is it Gene  Or Paul  Or Peter  What kiss member  Your birthday  Was Sunday  But we celebrated  Yesterday  And now we can  Continue the  Happy birthday  Jimmy Bith  Yay  Your birthday  Is exhausting  It's my birthday  It's exhausting  For everybody  I'm a birthday boy  Ian go ahead  In that last clip  Barbara Walters  As she was running  Through all her  Conspiracies  Said that the  Holocaust

[00:23:00]  How's it going  Hello  I just wondered  Whatever became  Of Buzz Aldrin  After he punched  A guy in the face  He probably got sued  By that douche bag  I'm guessing a suit  I don't know  But I don't remember  Reading anything about it  If I was Buzz Aldrin  I would have went  Prove it  Prove I hit him  Yeah  I didn't hit him  Look at where the shadow is  You faked that video  The way his head goes back  Yeah  He just made his head  Go back on his own  Yeah  And then when he fell  To the ground  He punched himself  In the eye  You know there are people 
[00:23:30]  That say that  Slavery  Wasn't  As  Horrible  As history  Has made it out to be  I'm all for it  People were well treated  You know  Food and shelter  And stuff like that  What's Whoopi's opinion  On that one  I wonder  There are some people  That say  And there are  Arguments  You can read arguments  About it  On the internet  And what  Because you read them  That's fun  And it's 
[00:24:00]  Something to perpetuate  And speak to other people about  In a forum  That people actually listen  Yours is irresponsible  You're being irresponsible  Can we get Whoopi on the show  Are we trying  She doesn't exist  Where's Steve  Is Steve working today  Yeah he's here  Steve's back  Yeah it's not Monday  It's not Monday  So Steve's back  There's a lot of controversy  Steve's saying  He never said  That he was taking  All those Mondays off  The Steve conspiracy  Is amazing  That conspiracy  Is way better  Than any other conspiracy  9-11 
[00:24:30]  The moon  The holocaust  Anything  The Steve saying  He was taking  Every Monday off  For the foreseeable future  Well he just got married  Conspiracy  Is huge  He just got married  For the second time  And I guess  Instead of a honeymoon  He  He explained  That he wanted  To take a few Mondays off  The staff swears  That he said  For the foreseeable future  And he said  There's a big difference  Between those two statements  And Steve said  He sent an email out  To me  You and Ant  Which I'm not saying  He didn't  He probably did  He said  He sent an email  Saying that  And then we got 
[00:25:00]  No response  Saying it was not okay  So he assumed  It was okay  But yes  It is a big  The puff of smoke  Was out of a white bag  Full of protein powder  The original email  That I did read  I deleted  As soon as I read it  But it seemed like  He was going to take  A few Mondays off  Where is she?  And then it turned into  For the foreseeable future  Can we get Steve in here?  He should be  Why is he not  Trotting down?  Where is he?  The whole staff  Swears he said  Forseeable future  And Steve said 
[00:25:30]  It was just a few Mondays  Well I sent him a text  And then said that  You know  We're believing the hype  From these guys  I sent him a text yesterday  There was an issue  We had here  About a guest  So I said to Steve  Why wasn't the guest  Why wasn't the staff  Told about this  Situation with this guest  Because again  You got to tell the guys  And he wrote me back later  I think  And said they were sent  An email on Friday  By the way  The punch the face guy  Yeah  He later attempted  To use the tape  To convince police  And prosecutors 
[00:26:00]  That he was the victim  Of an assault  However  It was decided  That Aldrin  Had been provoked  And did not actually injure  This douche bag  Good  And so no charges  Were filed  But the incident  Was covered  In the media  So he got  He got off  Good  He was provoked  The guy did  He got right in his face  That's self defense  I like that  Fiasque me  I like that  Fiasque me  I think that was  Everybody looking the other way  Because the second guy  On the moon  Was being shit talking  Dex somebody  Exactly  And he dexed somebody  That's treating the guy 
[00:26:30]  Exactly how he should  Have been treated  Sure  You fucking  You want to call  A man like that  A liar  Hey he's going to  Punch you in the fucking face  He doesn't care  If you got a camera  And a mic  Or anything like that  You think Buzz Aldrin  Has got anything  To fucking lose  At this point in his life  Fuck that  The guy walked on the moon  Don't blow me  And I think he knows people  You know what I mean  Yeah  You know what  You're right  I think he knows people  I didn't even think of that  Yeah  I didn't even think of the people  That he knows  Oh my god  He actually knows Martians  He knows a few people 
[00:27:00]  I bet  He knows everyone  Why do you think  There were no charges  And he didn't have to pay shit  He had to make a look  In the media  But the reason is  Because Buzz Aldrin  He knows people  Yeah  If we could get out  Of a lousy parking ticket  And wear shock jocks  Guess what you could get out of  If you're an astronaut  Walking on the moon  God he knows everyone  You're right  Every fucking foreign  Because it's not just our country  It's every country in the world  Is impressed by the guy on the moon  Every president  Yeah  From Kennedy on  Kissed his ass  And do you 
[00:27:30]  Think about this also  The guy that he punched  That he was talking shit  Well not Kennedy  He wasn't up there yet  No no  No I know all that  But I mean  Did Kennedy meet  Like Buzz Aldrin  And those guys  No  I don't think they were  Decided  No  Alright  No  I was just assuming  A little too much  Kennedy called him  A pussy boy actually  Kennedy insulted him  Buzz Aldrin dropped Oswald  Buzz Aldrin  Buzz Aldrin  I was going to say Oswald  I said Buzz Aldrin  I got nervous  I want to make it perfectly clear  I know that Kennedy was dead 
[00:28:00]  When we landed on the moon  I just assumed the whole thing  Was already in the works  For a few years  And then maybe Kennedy  Met these young  These youngsters  As they were preparing  To do this  It was at the end  Of the decad  I know that  When did they decide  On the astronauts though  It had to be a few years  Before 69  Well the original  Mercury 7  But when did they decide  When they decided  On them  What early  Early 60s  That's what I'm saying  So why couldn't  Tell me to meet these guys  He wasn't 
[00:28:30]  Buzz Aldrin  One of the original  Those guys  Okay  No  Gotcha  Unless you say  Lyndon Johnson  On  Yeah  I'm sure  Lyndon Johnson  Definitely  Johnson  Actually Nixon  Was president  When they landed on the moon  So should we allow Steve  To have his say  Absolutely  Considering he got beat up  Pretty good yesterday  Yeah I think we should  Absolutely  Allow that  Yes  Danny  Why's Danny  Pounding the table  He's telling you  To hold on a sec  Like he's doing something  Like you know  Oh Jesus  It instantly 
[00:29:00]  Just takes off  Here we go  And we're off  Oh by the way  I want to say hi  To Andy P in Atlanta  This is  This is  This is the future  Right in front of our faces  Boys  I've been hearing about this  A little bit here and there  But it's becoming big  Listening to the show  At 35,000 feet  With the iPhone app  And Delta in flight  Wi-Fi  Oh wow  They got that Wi-Fi  Working on the planes  Here and there  But by next year  Two years from now 
[00:29:30]  Every flight will have  Fucking Wi-Fi  That rocks  I think Elo  Was doing a little  Wi-Fi-ing in the air  Joe Rogan tweeted  That he did a little  Wi-Fi-ing in the air  And now Andy P in Atlanta  Listening to the show  35,000 feet in the air  How cool is that  Continental doesn't even  Have laptop plugs  On half the planes  So guys  Get with the times  That's terrible  Yo-cha  Alright Steve  Is that going to make  Flying so much easier  When you got some  Wi-Fi action  Are you kidding me  Without a doubt  Without a doubt  You're just  You're just  Internetting your ass off  You don't even know  You're in the air 
[00:30:00]  For four or five hours  The amount  First of all  I don't know if they'll  Charge you to be on Wi-Fi  If they do  They charge a buck or two  Fine  That's like  Fine  Keep the ticket prices down  But it'll kill  Fucking hours online  I'll just get a list  From Danny  Of sites to visit  So I can just  Jack off  As I'm flying  Through the cosmos  I don't know  Danny's got some  Of the best sites  Me?  I'm just  You know  I'm a man  I know how to find stuff  Yeah exactly  Like red  It's a good list  Steve 
[00:30:30]  There's a big controversy  Here  Conspiracy theories  You're saying one thing  And the entire staff  Is saying another thing  And I mean the entire staff  Oh I know  The original email  You said  I assumed  It was just a few Mondays  But then  It took on a life  Of its own  And everyone is saying  It was for the foreseeable future  Including Steve Blatter  By the way  Who's your boss  Right  And I spoke to Steve  Even Blatter saying  That you said  Foreseeable future  I said 
[00:31:00]  I spoke to Steve  Last night  And I'm going to speak  To him again today  And we're going to  Work this whole thing out  When I found out  How much time  Me and some of the  Other guys had off  I said  Well there's  There's some days off  That we have  And we can't  And we're obviously  Not going to be able  To get  To use all of them  But we can use  Some of them  You do realize  It worked the other way  Too right  All those years  Of taking four  Five  Six weeks off  That was like  Something that  Probably shouldn't  Have happened  Yeah I know 
[00:31:30]  And this is  For me and Ann  Certainly weren't  Going to be  The ones going  Hey you guys  Shouldn't have  As much fucking  Vacation time  As us  Oh absolutely  Absolutely  And  So what's in your  Favor the other way  Too  I understand that  I understand that  And I said  Well there's no way  That we're going to  Be able to use  To be able to use  Some of  All of it  So  But we can  Certainly use  Some of it  Now I got  Married  The other week  And I said  Well in advance  Of this  To my bosses  That I wanted  To take some  Mondays off  In lieu of  Taking a honeymoon  Because the show 
[00:32:00]  Came first  And nobody  Voiced an objection  To it  Now  And I also  Told you  Because it  Seemed like  It was a few  Mondays  And that few  Mondays was  July and a few  In August  That was a few  And it adds up  To about six  I think  That's a little  More than a few  Four in July  Two in August  Is six  Six days  Is that  Five per month  That's a little  Over a week  That's borderline  More than a few  To be honest with you  I'm starting to lean  Into the 
[00:32:30]  Holy shit category  Alright well nobody  Lean into the  Holy shit  Nobody  Holy shit  I wish I could do  That category  Nobody  Imagine it  We could get the  Next six Mondays  Off  Are you kidding me  I can't downplay that  Cherished  I got this funny joke  I do  I'm running for office  And I say  No more Mondays  It's great  Jim  Alright so  You  So if you  Send out an email  I didn't know  The Blue Sound  Rat song  Was about Steve  Carlisi 
[00:33:00]  Do you have a  Copy of the email  Because I'll just  Clear it up  Sure do  Okay there you go  Sure do  Absolutely  Monday Monday  I can't work  That day  Just another  Manic Monday  I prefer Sunday  Absolutely  Just another  Sleep in Monday  That's my  Come day  I'm sorry Steve  You went in  Striking distance  So I brought it  And I of course  Stipulated that if  Anybody else was out  I wouldn't be 
[00:33:30]  I wouldn't be doing that  Which I absolutely did  When Travis was out  I completely stayed in  What about the  Other part of the  Equation where you  Don't even answer  Your phone on a  Monday  Nobody  Everybody's got  My home phone  Everybody's got it  Everyone called you  Yesterday  Nobody called my  House phone  Didn't ring once  Travis  We called both  Numbers yesterday  Yeah you called  My cell phones  You called my cell phones  They were in the  Other room  I didn't have them  With me  Nobody called my  House phone  Everybody's got it  Everybody's got it  Who doesn't have 
[00:34:00]  Their cell phone  Near them though  Come on  I didn't  Yesterday  I was  The entire morning  What time did you  Get up yesterday  About seven  And you didn't hear  Your cell phone  Ring once  Come on Steve  No I didn't  If I'm more than  A foot away  From my cell phone  I have a panic attack  Do you pass these over  Sure  Absolutely  Oh Sam's running  Down the hall  What is this  Anyway  Transcripts  No that's  Who is this sent to  This sent to  My boss's 
[00:34:30]  Steve  Oh to Steve  Rob  Okay  And this was sent  This morning  No  I'm Casey  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  That's not true  That's not true  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  That would make 7  Now we're up to 7 Mondays  Not 6  Yeah but one of these  I didn't take  So  Oh  Thank you  Wait wait wait  Thank you for giving us  That day  Okay  Okay well this is  June 26th 
[00:35:00]  Sure  This was sent out  At 3.53 a.m.  And then it says  That you're taking time off  And so for the foreseeable future  And then it has a bunch of dates  Yeah but listen  And then it goes  And so forth  And so on  There's the word foreseeable  That you told me last night  You didn't say  It's right in your email  Wait wait wait  What is and so forth and so on  Doesn't that mean that 
[00:35:30]  You continue  Right  With the Mondays  That what is and so forth and so on  There's a lot of guilt in your email  This is  Because the key to this whole thing  The key to what we were discussing yesterday  A few Mondays  And I said  I had a problem with the word foreseeable  And the foreseeable is right in the email  You sent to your own bosses  And then Ann also points out  And so forth and so on  Which means  Which means it's going to continue  That's a dot dot dot for the dates  We have 
[00:36:00]  We have  629  7 6  7 13  7 20  7 27  8 3  8 10  8 17  Through 8 24  Vacation days  And then 8 31  And so forth and so on  Which would lead me to believe  You mean  9  Whatever  6  Right  And then 9  Whatever  And just so on and so forth  Right  My intention for saying that  Was only up to  Only through August  It was not going to go beyond that  But what is and so forth and so on 
[00:36:30]  I will  My defense in this  Is that I'm crazy  Alright  And that I don't  You can't plead in Saturday  You can't plead in Saturday  It's not insanity  Everyone's crazy on this show  Everyone is misrepresenting what you're saying  But in your own email  You plead insanity on this show  I'm not pleading in Saturday  I'm not pleading in Saturday  You said my only defense is that I'm crazy  I'm fucking nuts  You said and so forth and so on  And your answer is I'm crazy  You said you didn't use the word foreseeable  Which is right in your original email 
[00:37:00]  And so forth and so on  This is very obvious that you want to take  Pretty much every Monday off  That you possibly can  That's the only way you could read this  But that's not  Listen, that's not what I meant  That's not what I meant  And that's not what I was going to do  You said these guys are  Basically liars  And miscommunicating  And it's getting back to us  And they're working me and Ann  And all this crap  How are they working us  When it's in your own email  That was not my intention  To do that  And so forth and so on  Is the smoking gun 
[00:37:30]  All right, fair enough  But that means you want  Your Mondays off  Continuing  Into September  No, it's not  It's really not  Explain what  And so forth and so on  Means  For real  Yeah  Honestly, that was the first email  I sent out  And I really didn't get  And I didn't get a response  From anybody  But I was only going to do  Through the vacation days  Maybe you sent us  A different email  Do you have the one  That you sent to Ann  I actually don't remember  Getting it  But that's not what it says  But no  So forth and so on 
[00:38:00]  Means you are going  To continue  The thought that you  Put on paper  There's a pattern here  It's every Monday  That's the pattern  And then  Dot dot dot  And so forth and so on  Means  The pattern will continue  How about this  Subject  Monday's off  Foreseeable future  And so forth and so on  Everything else  Doesn't mean shit  That really  Yeah  That really pretty much  Just spells it out  I don't  Reading 
[00:38:30]  Reading  And this is basically  Saying the same thing  That you want  A lot of Mondays off  No it doesn't  It says  It really doesn't  I'll read it  Just so people know  If it's cool  I won't say her name  just so you're in the loop 
[00:39:00]  no no I'm reading  I'm getting married on Saturday  I'm keeping it on the DL  until my girl and I actually do it  but since she's out of town  half the week all the time  I want to use some of my 75 days off  and then in parentheses  yes that's really how much I have stored up  to spend a day with her  and taking off Mondays would allow me to do that  obviously on days we're short staffed  I won't be out Bladder and Cross are already okay with it  but it dawned on me that I hadn't told you guys yet  again I'm keeping it quiet until we do it 
[00:39:30]  but I want you to know that's my plan  as long as you have no objection  some of the guys namely me Eric and Derek  have a lot of an obscene amount of  paid time off that were built up with XM  that we have to use by next June  why don't you acknowledge Danny and Travis in this email  because they're  they have the time off everybody's got it  everybody's got it  and everybody's got their list of how much they have  but the amount of time that the  that those three of us have  is so much so far and gone  beyond what everybody else has 
[00:40:00]  because we've been on the books longer  an obscene amount of paid time off  that built up with XM  that we have to use by June  we probably won't be able to use  anywhere near all of it  but we can use some  you say 51 days in the one email  75 in this one  am I incorrect or no?  no you're not  51 sick days I have  one is sick days plus days off  because we got two different emails  from the HR department  I will say in this one 
[00:40:30]  you do say that you're just checking  to make sure it's okay  as long as you have no objection  it is kind of tough though  and so forth and so on  it does in a way  it's like that does kind of implicate  that you want to do  a lot  this one says taking Mondays off  would allow me to do that  it doesn't state how many  or how few  you are thinking about taking off  the one thing though  where it says  obviously on days we're short staffed  I won't be out  now that leads me to believe 
[00:41:00]  on days that you're not short staffed  you will be out  in that amount of time  again I'm only talking about  in these two months  no  no though  and so forth and so on  it covers the  so forth and so on  it kills your whole argument  I understand that  that covers 51 Mondays  if you ever say  or 75  depending on what it is  so forth and so on  until your days run out  that's like 
[00:41:30]  that's like whenever you go  like okay  let's count  even numbers  2, 4, 6, 8  who do we appreciate Steve  hooray  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12  and so on and so forth  it doesn't end  it just keeps going  until you  you know  so you run out of the 51  6 days  that you list  and so on  it's not  and so forth  until  and so forth  and so on  at no point  did I ever articulate  to any of my bosses  or you guys  that I was planning on  taking a year's worth  of Mondays 
[00:42:00]  I spoke to him  you think we're confused  he was like  look there's nothing  I can do about it  no there's nothing  he can do about it  but he finally  yesterday voiced  his disapproval  but you made it sound  like we all are crazy  and the fact is  you  you  you  you fucked up  this whole thing  from the beginning  with your email  I never fucked up  anything  foreseeable future  and so forth  and so on  I rest my case  that doesn't say  a year's worth  get me a judge  on the phone  let me a jury  we would win 
[00:42:30]  so easily  I understand it  but jumping to the conclusion  that I was going to  take a year off  that's not true  I never articulated that  ever  and I'll go back  to foreseeable future  and so forth  and so on  and I got 51 sick days  that means pretty much  every Monday  that doesn't mean anything  for the next year  I never articulated it  absolutely not  I didn't  I didn't  how are we supposed  I'm not sure  I'll be asking you this  because I don't want to  put words  around and around  and around  how could you interpret  how could somebody  interpret  like when you 
[00:43:00]  listed the Mondays  if you had listed  just the Mondays  through August  then you go  that's August  but how could  somebody have  interpreted  and so forth  and so on  read your own email  and explain  I did  and I have  several times over  out loud  on the show  because I can't  just sit here  Anthony can I have  a copy of Steve's  first book please  it's going to be  almost impossible  for people  to believe  I understand that  listen  and I know  I'm going to get  my nuts smashed  because your own words  kill you  so read  read your email  subject  Mondays off  heads up  go from there  and explain  what you mean  after every sentence  just a heads up 
[00:43:30]  for the next  bunch of Mondays  excluding those days  when Travis  is on a paternity leave  or the days  we need people  to cover  I'm going to  take some of  the 51 sick days  I have  so for the  foreseeable future  and you know  you're right  you're right  that should not  have been in there  but it's my own fault  for using that terminology  and then I list  the 29th  you know  every Monday  through there  some of which  I did not take off  alright  and then I put in  so forth  and so on  again  should not have  put it in there  because it  leads one to  jump to an  unreasonable conclusion  unreasonable 
[00:44:00]  no  that's where  the communication  sucks  it's a reasonable  conclusion  to think  and so forth  and so on  means this  will continue  with the pattern  that I have  stated here  it just  it will continue  that's what  and so forth  and so on  is  absolutely  no objection  between the 29th  or the 26th  of June  and when I sent  you guys  the one I sent  you which was  July 7th  was an objection  stated to 
[00:44:30]  anything that I wrote  at all  Steve let me ask you  a question  now Travis  were you here  during Travis's  maternity leave  yes  what age was that  I don't remember  Steve I'm not gonna  I could read this  I certainly wouldn't  blow up your spot  by reading emails  you don't want me to read  but I could read this  you write  there's a lot  of deliberate  miscommunication  going on  how is it  deliberate  miscommunication  when we read  your email  one way  and you're  swearing it  wasn't meant  to be that way  so these guys 
[00:45:00]  are guilty  of deliberate  miscommunication  are you kidding me  you make it  very gray here  make it very easy  for people  to miscommunicate  to see it  a completely  different way  some of the stuff  that is said  about me  in regards to this  is absolutely  not true  like what  I never said  I was gonna take  a year's worth  that was said  I don't know  who said it  I never said that  I never said  I was gonna take  a year  we said  which is in your email  that you're gonna take  every Monday off  for the foreseeable future 
[00:45:30]  and then I heard  that could be more  than a year  to be honest with you  who knows what  that really means  foreseeable future  means way more  than a few Mondays  I'm sorry  you list eight days here  now you said  unless Travis  is on leave  so you had said  that you wanted  to take about  six days  now which  Travis  what days  were you out  and was Steve  because Steve  might have been out  have I been here  no he was there  I was only out  for one straight week  was that the sixth  yeah  okay so  this is the only thing  that I want to question  at the bottom 
[00:46:00]  it says  and so forth  and so on  but then Steve says  so that's about  eight days right there  obviously I'll let  the rest of my guys know  if it was intended  to be forever  why put eight days  right there  like was  and so forth  and so on  meaning that this  pattern will continue  like if Travis  is out for two or three  days until I take  my six or seven days  no that meant  you know what  in if I'm  if I have to  try to remember  what I was thinking  I was gonna put  those right there  and then play it 
[00:46:30]  by ear for the rest  of the time  you know  and that's fair  that's fair  but you know what  I can't  because you do say  foreseeable future  you do say  my only thing  is you say  I think it's then  going back  and saying so  that's about  eight days right there  that he listed  okay  but then  and so forth  and so on  he didn't include  that in the  so that's about  eight days right there  he's got 51  to begin with  it doesn't really  vindicate him  for the  and so forth  and so on  which  there's another  43 coming  yeah  to be honest  it really does  and you said  you let  you meaning me 
[00:47:00]  man this pissed me off  big time  you let those guys  instigate an entire  line of bullshit  no your own email  instigated everything  that is happening  to you Steve  I didn't let  nobody do shit  no you have  a guy  you have a bunch  of guys in here  that's like this  lord of the flies  mentality  dude when you  write an email  like this  there's no  instigation going  on  but this makes  people go  holy shit  the guy that  is our boss  is taking  pretty much  every Monday  off  my boss  my bosses  were the only  ones who saw  this email  my bosses 
[00:47:30]  were the only  ones who saw  this email  so nobody  was privy  to this  what were they  privy to  the calendars  during our staff  meetings  where it's  upcoming bookings  and shit  that's going on  and then every  Monday  just down the  line  it says  Steve off  Steve off  Steve off  Steve off  and that was  about four  it came up  in a meeting  and I remember  somebody saying  Steve you're taking  every Monday off  and you're like  yeah I was like  for how long  and you said  for the foreseeable  future  for the foreseeable  future could mean  so I'll say  I  so then how  so then if  that's what's  said from you 
[00:48:00]  how is anybody  on this staff  twisting words  no one's lying  we're not  no one's  no one's  we're not letting  guys instigate  an entire line  of bullshit  and then  and you bought  into it  oh I did  huh  nice  when he say  foreseeable future  your email says  foreseeable future  the boss  Steve Blatter  I guess he  he bought into  the line of  bullshit too  because he's like  yeah that's what  I that's what  I read this to be  every fucking  Monday  I told him  last night  I said I never  said a full year  I never said 
[00:48:30]  it never  articulated  I don't think  anybody said  a full year  yeah it's  it was said  on the air  yesterday  believe me  I listened to  that  it was said  on the air  and I didn't  I never said  so there's a  difference between  us saying a full  year and you  saying a few  Mondays  it's obviously  somewhere way  in between  well whatever  it means  it's not  you know  obviously I can't  do it  obviously I can't  do it  you can do  whatever you want  no apparently  I can't  apparently I can't  you got the days  no I  apparently I can't  because  it's just hard to  run a show  when the executive 
[00:49:00]  producer has  decided to  work a four day  work week like  Howard Stern  holy shit  we would all  love that  fucking deal  no but you  know what  nobody voiced  an objection  to anything  I said  all you had  to do was  say I'm not  cool with it  the first email  we were cool  with because it  sounded like a  few Mondays  this one  it makes  foreseeable future  and so forth  and so on  that's all I'll  keep saying  over and over  again  and I  would win  in front of  a judge  every time  we weren't  on that  one though  so  but that  just became 
[00:49:30]  part of  what  what  what is  what was  known to  be  the truth  where's Sam  because you know  you know  you think Danny's  always picking on you  Sam what do you  know about this  he said  the words  foreseeable future  to me  to my face  I said how many  he said I'm  getting married  this weekend  I'm not telling  anybody until  it's done  I'm going  after that  I'm going to  be taking  every Monday  off for the  foreseeable future 
[00:50:00]  the year  thing came up  yesterday  when we said  how many sick  days does he  have  your email  says 51  sick days  that's about  a year  you said  foreseeable future  every Monday  so 51 weeks  could be  a year  nobody said  you are definitely  taking every Monday  for a year off  but  that is a  strong possibility  when you have  51 days  one day a week  that's a safe  assumption  it was a little  vague  but it's an  assumption  nonetheless  and what I  meant by  foreseeable future 
[00:50:30]  was more  accurate assumption  than what you're  saying  well  it's a  moot point  at this  level  because I  can't do  it  I can't  do it  alright  initially  nobody had  a problem  now everyone's  got a problem  last week  nobody had a  problem  with it  now it's a  problem  I'm only saying  that I can  understand  why  sometimes the  staff gives you  a hard time  but I can't  understand why  somebody would  interpret that  as thinking  you meant a  year's worth of  money  it's like when you  read that  it's kind of  hard to not  interpret that  nobody 
[00:51:00]  nobody  except my  bosses  saw  that  initial  email  but  it  doesn't  even  matter  at this  point  because  you  said it  to enough  people  that  foreseeable  future  Danny  heard it  Sam  heard it  Steve  Blatter  heard it  and I think  it was more  like  we started  having a problem  with your  original email  and what  happened  yesterday  because  a few  Mondays  just turned  into a  foreseeable  future  and I  even asked  Steve  Blatter  what's  going on  with Steve  well no  it's pretty 
[00:51:30]  much every  Monday  and there's  nothing we  can do  about it  what does  E-Rock have  to say  about this  E-Rock  did you hear  foreseeable  future  or did  you hear  a few  Mondays  because  they  just  got  married  actually  I didn't  even hear  both  I was  told  I was  told  that  when we  were finding  out about  all these  days  he's  like  you gotta  take  them  off  what are  you doing  oh I'm  taking  Mondays  off  for how  long  well I can  take them  off as long  as I want  I have  the days  is what  I was  told  that's more  than a few 
[00:52:00]  by the way  I got an  email from  Steve on  June 28th  saying that  I will be  out on  Mondays  except for  when Travis  is out  so it's  pretty much  stating that  he was  taking  yeah it's  open ended  it's open  ended  it's open  ended  I wouldn't  imagine it  would be a  year or  something  but it is  open  and my  intentions  were to  make it  very  very brief  I was not  intending to  make it a  year and it  got absolutely  blown out of  proportion  due to  the email 
[00:52:30]  had to be  the email  when I read  that all I  can think is  I'm surprised  they never got  back to you and  said what the  fuck  yeah well you  know what  nobody did  nobody did  nobody said  boo to me  about it  at all  they legally  can't tell you  not to take  the days  they can say  I'd rather you  didn't  they could say  could you  work something  else out  which is what  my boss said  to me last  night  let's work  something else  out  and that  was after  I got my 
[00:53:00]  nuts smashed  in yesterday  so fine  so I'm  going to  you know  what we  got  because we  weren't privy  to the first  one with this  so forth and  so on  the one that  we got  is a little  more  even more  vague  than the  so forth and  so on  one  hence my  response  which is  right here  no problem  Steve  happy for you  guys  yeah  because it  sounds like  I'm just  going to  take a couple  of Mondays  off here and  there  and then when  you hear  you're going  to take a few  Mondays off  of course the  staff's going  to start talking 
[00:53:30]  and then we  start hearing the  rumblings a few  Mondays he's saying  foreseeable future  he's saying every  Monday he's saying  he's got over  50 fucking sick  days he's got to  use up so he's  going to take  Mondays off  well you heard  rumblings you  didn't hear from  me  everyone heard  it  well that's  everyone that's  not me  nobody asked me  my home phone  didn't ring  yesterday  I've never had  fucking cell phone  literally the entire  time you're here  I'm not buying  that you're away  from your cell phone  for more than an  hour please 
[00:54:00]  we tried calling  you all day  yesterday  yeah I know  and I thought  you texted Liam  back  get your point  on the radio  because yeah  it was getting  pretty ugly for you  so we're like  you know what  let's get Steve's  point  so we called  you all fucking  day  well I didn't  see it until  afterwards  I didn't  but you texted  Liam at 930  you texted Liam  on your phone  at 930  yeah because Liam  said I was getting  my nuts smashed  but then how could  you have  not seen the  missed calls  have you had  your phone  at 930  yeah you said  you didn't  see the calls  you just told  Travis  I don't  Steve  what the fuck  what do you mean 
[00:54:30]  what the fuck  you're talking  in circles  I'm not talking  in circles  Travis what did  he say about  you calling  he said he never  saw us call  alright  if we called  your cell phones  50 times  and then you  texted Liam  back while we  were still  on the air  you didn't see  all the missed  calls  you had to have  clicked ok  on 50  and then we're  still on the air  for another hour  hour and 50  we actually kind of  went late yesterday  we went to about  1040 1045  so you had  every opportunity  to defend yourself  yesterday on the show  well calling up  just to get my nuts 
[00:55:00]  kicked wasn't a  priority  no no no no  Steve I also  tried calling you  too because Liam  was trying to get  in touch with you  for 15 minutes  he didn't know  you were off  yesterday and he  was handling ace  and some other  stuff going on  so he finally  called the office  looking for you  and I said  oh Steve's not  in today  whole talent  department has  my home number  whole talent  department  he couldn't  get in touch  with you  then after I  spoke to Liam  I started calling  you from the office  and it just went  right to your  voicemail  so I dealt  with Liam  for the rest  of the stuff  that day  but he had  no idea  and you booked  that whole thing  whole talent  department  has my home number 
[00:55:30]  a bunch of people  screaming and saying  bullshit  he said it on the radio  last week  he said it on the radio  who said what  that you were  that you were taking  a lot of Mondays  off  when did I say that  I don't know  but it came in  a few times  I'm not going to  listen to hearsay  from the audience  they've been known  to lie through their teeth  all I'm saying is  it's something to look  into more than  a few are saying it  there really is  an overwhelming  amount of evidence  anyway  just in the documentation  I like keeping  this illegal  it just  you know  I don't know  the so forth  and so on  kind of got me 
[00:56:00]  that's all  nobody voiced  an objection  nobody  nobody  I'm just doing  a little road warrior  noob  and you're right  in terms of  in terms of continuity  now I will not be doing  I'm not going to do it anymore  I'm not going to do it anymore  I got  I got a wife at home  who cried  because my  because she heard me  getting the shit kicked  out of me yesterday  so that was a fun evening  for me  and you know  are you watching  the wedding video  no video  I'm not going to do it 
[00:56:30]  I'm not going to do it  they can just sit there  and I won't use them  I won't use them  no we'd never say  not use them  no you know what  yeah  you know what  take a week  during vacation  or something like that  or something  that's where you're  insane Steve  to be real  it's not an all or nothing  because we're not saying  it's an all or nothing  but that's certainly  what it sounds like  no  no we just need  we need  an executive producer here  on a steady Monday 
[00:57:00]  100% of the week  instead of 80%  it can't be like  like Mondays  for the foreseeable future  or no  like with no end in sight  for us  we can't go  okay  we just have to  not have an executive producer  for Mondays  for some vague amount of time  well if nothing else  but  if you came up  and said  hey guys  I'm going to fucking  you know  Bahamas  for a week  a week and a half  whatever  we're not going to go  no  we can't do it 
[00:57:30]  without you  we need  no that's fine  that is a beginning  and an end to it  you go  you have the time  you have fun  you take it  I honestly never thought  you'd allow that  it was the vagary  of this long  kind of extended  open ended  Monday off thing  you do understand  taking every Monday off  hurts a lot more  than just taking a week  out of nowhere  a week and a half  out of nowhere  I honestly never thought  you'd agree to that  I never thought  you'd agree to that  vacation  who would say no  on a honeymoon  nobody ever likes  your girl  nobody would 
[00:58:00]  nobody would have  said no to a week  for you and her  nobody  we probably would have  tried to talk her out of it  but nobody would have  said don't go away  for a honeymoon  I never thought  anybody would go for it  that's way  it's way worse  to take every Monday off  for the foreseeable future  well I wasn't going  to take it for an eternity  and I wasn't going  to take it for a year  and I wasn't going  to do any of that  how many Mondays  were you going to take off  even though it says  foreseeable future  and so forth and so on  I was going to stop  as you listed eight  the last Monday  the last Monday  I was going to take off  after consideration  was going to be  the one before vacation 
[00:58:30]  and that was it  so you shouldn't have wrote  and so forth and so on  it does make it  kind of difficult  which makes you so guilty  and you're saying  we're misrepresenting  what you're saying  it implies a pattern  it does make it hard  it does imply a pattern  fair enough  but you know what  again my bosses  were the only one  who saw that  and I'm allowed  Steve stop with that shit  because when you say  something to Steve Blatter  in an email  that says  foreseeable future  a lot of Mondays  listed and so forth  and so on  you don't think  Steve Blatter  is then going to  talk to me and Anthony  that's where it all 
[00:59:00]  yes he did  yesterday  or before then  a while ago  and your response  to that was  and then it all came out  yesterday  and then we try to  get you on the phone  to get your side  of the story  why does nobody pipe up  before then  nobody  why does nobody  everybody was piping up  yesterday  and then it came out  yesterday  yes  because yesterday  was a  Monday  so it was  if you'd rather  I didn't do it  you should have  said so  but nobody 
[00:59:30]  said anything  so we're wrong  because  everyone  I explained earlier  why no one  said anything  because the boss  has got one email  we got another  the boss's email  throws up a red flag  because it's  and so forth  and so on  that isn't as vague  as the email  to us  which said  some Mondays  and like  Obi said  his response  was no problem  Steve happy for you guys  this doesn't throw up  any open ended  Monday red flag  but if they talked to you  months ago  this one does  first of all  you're exaggerating that 
[01:00:00]  your email is June 26  so sometime  between June 26  Steve Blatter came to us  and was like  well  we've got a weird  situation here  and it was developing  and it all came to a head  yesterday  because it was another  Monday that you  weren't here  and Obi does respond  it's almost like  my thing was  when Ope's response  is hey no problem man  meaning he thought  you were going to  take a few Mondays  and was kind of  cool with it  if he had responded  to the list of email 
[01:00:30]  the list of dates  and then said no problem  but that wasn't  the one he responded to  he responded to  the other one  so you know what I mean  where he probably  thought you were  just going to  take a few Mondays  and if you wrote  me and Ant this one  then you wrote  to Steve Blatter  and Robert Cross  we would have  absolutely had  a major problem  with this  and would have said  Steve what the fuck  are you doing  these are two  completely different emails  right the emails  are completely  and then when we get  the and when you  write this one  to the bosses  and then it's  on our radar  like what the hell  is Steve doing  I thought it was  a few Mondays  now I'm here  and it's more  and then we're  trying to get  to the bottom of it  and then it all 
[01:01:00]  came to a head  yesterday  so yesterday  was the only  was the first time  that either of  my bosses  addressed it  with you guys  no  leading up to  yesterday  why didn't you  just forward this  to Ope  I mean  I really  I said myself  to be polite  but really  for open air  why didn't you  forward this one  that you had sent  to a bladder and cross  on June 26th  oversight  to be perfectly honest  with you  and by the way  and like Sam said  technically  they can't argue  the fact that you  have all these days  and you want to  take Mondays off 
[01:01:30]  they can't  it's illegal  they can't  I understand that  I understand that  so it's  so it's my own  so it's my  so you can do  whatever the fuck  you want  yes I know  and I'm not  going to take  every Monday  and I never said  I was going to take  every Monday  ever articulated it  well you can  we don't mind  it's actually  you know  for  after all this  it's like  no it's cool  go ahead  yeah exactly  it's actually  it's actually  endearing  that the shit  hits the fan 
[01:02:00]  when I'm not here  considering how useless  everybody says I am  what shit is hitting  the fan  that you're not here  what shit hit the fan  we had a great show  yesterday  don't insult  no I bet  no that  what shit hit the fan  no the fact that  I got fucking  beat down yesterday  when I wasn't here  no because we noticed  that you weren't here  the day you weren't here  now there's diversion  now you're diverting  what are you talking about  shit hitting the fan  for real  no I'm talking about  the fucking beat down  I got yesterday  why the fuck  isn't he here  what shit hit the fan 
[01:02:30]  you were talking about  the show  and now you're deflected  the show  no I'm not deflecting  you said it's endearing  that the shit hit the fan  while you weren't here  so what does that mean  that I wasn't here  that I wasn't here  what does that mean  it means that he feels  almost like a compliment  that he wasn't here  and things came apart  at the seams  no that's not what I said  Anthony's way more logical  than me  trust me  I'm a hothead  I'm a hothead  that's how everyone heard it  so how did the shit  hit the fan  because that's a direct  insult to us  I think we had 
[01:03:00]  a great show yesterday  I heard it  and it was very good  but the fact that  there was a fucking meltdown  makes me think  that there was a major issue  so alright  so I'm not here  causes a major issue  I don't even know  what he's saying anymore  it's not that you're not here  to cause a major issue  what do you mean by that  I mean that you guys  lambasted me  for a good 30 minutes  on the air yesterday  for not being here  and you had an opportunity  to call the show yesterday  and certainly  or deal with it today 
[01:03:30]  like we are doing  the reason that you guys  were so mad  that he wasn't here  was because obviously  us guys could not handle  the hugeness of the show  and everything that it entails  so the fact that you guys  got so mad at him  was a testament to  how important he is  to be here  I think that's what  you're saying right  yeah that makes sense  yeah  okay well that's not  what happened at all  what's going on you Steve  are you alright  I'm not being a dick 
[01:04:00]  I'm asking for  oh I'm doing great  are you  no I you know  I love the fact that  you know that the  regular you know  ball smashing happens  that's  that yes I gotta say  yesterday  you know I try  sometimes I go after you  sometimes I go to bat for you  but this was a tough one  to criticize the guys on  even though I know  sometimes they fuck with you  but that is a tough one  and if you told Danny that  and you told Sam that  it is kind of tough  to not interpret it as that  you know what  you know what  here's the hard thing  I went to bat  especially with this  days off thing  for the entire staff  I went to bat  for the entire staff 
[01:04:30]  the entire staff  has a situation like this  some more  some less  yeah I appreciate that  you told D-Rock  to take Fridays off  because you're taking  Mondays off  so now we're gonna  you know that makes  it even worse  to try to put a  quality show on the air  for everybody  he's entitled to  he doesn't  and I never implied  to take every Friday off  I really didn't  that's not what they're  saying Steve  the problem that I had  was that  you've been saying  you have these days  you have these days  and I didn't really  want to take them  except when I had to  and I do have to take  one this Friday  why  because I do  but 
[01:05:00]  the point being that  Friday is our busiest day  for most of the staff  so I can't take a Friday off  even if I wanted to  he spells it  F-R-Y day  because someone just  eats fried food  every day is Friday  he sits in his adult diapers  in his living room  with fucking  on a big thing of plastic  like Lethal Weapon 2  and eats fries  until he goes into  a salt coma  honey I'm itchy  he just starts scratching  his body  he gets itchy 
[01:05:30]  hives  he's got like  fucking duck sauce  he doesn't even  fucking use scooper  he just pours it  onto his legs  and wipes the fry  and right leg is barbecue  left leg is sweet and sour  penis and balls  duck sauce  god damn  he lost a few pounds  I was actually  going to say that  I turned around  as you make it all  a fat joke  I'm like  wait a minute  I think he lost a few  no it's the haircut  the yo-yo is back  on the upswing  or downswing  or whatever you want to call it  the pelican neck  isn't as big  you're right  did you listen to me  I'm trying 
[01:06:00]  what are you doing  exercising  oh wow  good boy  how often  it's an exercise  in stupidity  it's exercising  what are you  doing for exercise  the elliptical  okay I do that too  big deal  yeah  so anyway  back to Steve  so  no the problem we have  with the morning  coughing  Jesus  what do you fucking work at  in the tuberculosis ward  why  there's pushups over petri dishes  you've had a cough since winter  what the fuck  we're heading into late summer 
[01:06:30]  at this point  Jesus  it comes and goes  you're like fucking  it's like  it's like Brando  at the end of the godfather  hymen sloth  put the pork rind in his mouth  chase the kid around  hell no I haven't bought that  sorry Eric  back to you  anyway  so  what were you talking about  no  point being that 
[01:07:00]  with the Fridays  can't do Fridays off  it would be easier  for like Sam and myself  to do a Monday  or a Tuesday  where our workload's  a little lighter  but that's not available  because Steve took Mondays  and I really don't feel  comfortable taking a second  taking a Monday off  and having a second staff member  you know down  while the show's going on  so I don't  I can't do Mondays  if Steve's taking everything  and I wasn't taking everything  and I never said  I was taking everything  that's not how  you made it seem  you had it on the schedule 
[01:07:30]  you told us  I had it for  three days  and you told us  in the office too  that you were taking Mondays off  that you were scheduling  Mondays for yourself  so everyone else here  isn't really going to  take a Monday off  because we're already  down somebody  yeah if like  for the next  for the next few  that's fine  that's not how it seemed  well that's not how it seemed  that's not what I meant  but you didn't correct it either  we're like how  Steve you realize  you kept going on  with these Mondays  you do cause your own problems  yeah I'm a little bit nuts  in that department  no you really do  cause your own problems 
[01:08:00]  what's going on with you though man  you seem like  you're holding on  it's like  I'm looking at your face  and you seem like  you're not bothered  by this thing  but there's something  really going on with you  I believe you believe  that what you're saying  but the problem is  how you portray this  to other people  makes it sound like  it's completely opposite  you do cause your own problems  because you don't communicate properly  let me address Jimmy  in a communication  I know that  I know that  people like to think  that I'm  you know  or at least  portray on the air  that I'm useless  I don't do shit 
[01:08:30]  I don't work  I don't do whatever the fuck  but I actually do  a lot of stuff  alright  it comes out  a lot  on the air  staff and hosts alike  whether it's joking  or just ball breaking  I've gone to bat  for the staff  numerous times  numerous times  some have been  well documented  some I'll never mention  but the fact  that there's a  fucking  you know  Lord of the Flies  beat down  every so often  makes me think  that  well what the fuck  am I going out of my way  to be nice to people for  alright let me ask you  why do you think that is  I think that 
[01:09:00]  the environment  that's fostered  by you guys  no disrespect  is absolutely  that  is absolutely  every man for himself  Lord of the Flies  when he's down  keep kicking him  absolutely  so that goes  throughout the staff  right  every man for himself  so like that's why  I'll bust Sam's balls  and throw his face  under a bus  that's why I fucking  I'll punch Travis  in the balls  every day  right  it's  cause it just happens  it's like Lord of the Flies  right  everybody's out for themselves  so  yeah  that's how it is  right  I think on the air  obviously 
[01:09:30]  something like that  is fostered  I mean  we beat the shit  out of each other  on the air  you know  but then  you know what  honestly  there's absolutely  no  there's no off switch  off the air  it seems  and that is  that's what bugs me  well that's a whole  different animal  I think  I don't think  I'm just defending  you know  myself here  the fact that  when we're fostering  an atmosphere  such as that  we do it on the air  yeah  I've never  told anybody 
[01:10:00]  to treat anybody  disrespectfully  or anything off the air  as a matter of fact  I you know  I've said not to do that  in many circumstances  so for you to  say that  you know  we're kind of guilty  for fostering  that atmosphere  is a bit unfair  I think  I think everyone knows  it's very different  off air  I think you know  that we don't  it's not the same thing  often when you and I  talk off air  it's totally different  no when you and I  talk off air  it's very respectful  and it's very funny  you know  it's very difficult  to control  and to  by and large 
[01:10:30]  the staff is  pretty cool  but sometimes  there's just  you know  this relentless  you know  ball busting  that I'm just like  you know  what am I  what am I doing  when is it though  I mean  I know I can speak  for myself  because it bugs me  to hear you say  stuff like that  like you know  off the air  it's like relentless  ball busting  when was the last time  I busted your balls  off the air  dude I  honestly  Dan and I  haven't really spoken  much  in the past  I don't even  know how many months  so it kind of bugs me  because I know  you know  Travis is in my office  Sam's in my office  so unless it's Eric  like I don't know  where it's coming from 
[01:11:00]  I don't know  where it's coming from  I don't know  where it's coming from  but I honestly don't know  because it'll happen  when I'm out of the room  you know  I'll see  and there's  shit messed up  on my desk  there's fucking  people screwing with  things on my desk  and I'm just like  what fucking  kindergarten stuff  am I dealing with  here  the Opian Anthony show  yeah but why  you know  I got shit to do  yeah I understand that  find somebody else  to fuck with  is my point  but on the air though  it bothers me  you said that  I mean  it's only because  like we do  we attack Eric 
[01:11:30]  constantly  well according  sorry  I don't even  I just gotta read  this  Dave C from New York City  Lord of the Flies  and you said Eric  there's no question  who's Mickey  Jesus fucking Christ  sorry you're right  sorry  it's so funny  trying to get a couple laughs  but we attack  Eric relentlessly  I mean  I know  look at Kenny  Kenny's  way more abuse  than Steve  we call Kenny  the big dope  I mean Kenny's  a fucking  a very competent  you know what I mean 
[01:12:00]  it's a different  animal  I think the point  I'm trying to make  is that  it's difficult  for some people  to make that separation  and I'm not talking  about the talent  I'm not talking  about you Jim  or Ant  or Op  I'm talking about  there's a disconnect  between  some of the younger guys  and the fact that  they can't talk that way  off air  but like off the air  E-Rock gets it  way worse than you  have you ever come back  and found your lunch  smashed in the garbage can  E-Rock is the one  who fucks with you 
[01:12:30]  off the air  I have no idea  because it's never been done  when I'm in the room  I honestly couldn't tell you  so then how do you know  it's being done  because it gets done  how do I  I show up in the morning  and every key  on the fucking keyboard  in my office  is completely replaced  one time in six months  no  how about  how about  six times  in six months  okay  let's see  even if  let's go ahead  and just pretend  that that's the truth  for a second  it is  that would be  once a month  it shouldn't be  any times a month  for the foreseeable future 
[01:13:00]  it shouldn't be  any times a month  your keyboard would be  fucked up  the point is  that it's not every month  and maybe it was  one time  maybe  it's one example  out of several  Steve's gonna run around  with a rifle yelling  QWERTY  QWERTY  keyboard joke  of course it is  it's just a keyboard joke  all I'm saying is that  if you want to  fling about accusations  and stuff  just at least have  something to back it up  because I know  that I don't  you know  off the air  we don't have a lot  to do with each other  you know  Travis  we all have our own  responsibilities post show 
[01:13:30]  so you know  if you're gonna go on  and say how  you know  there's relentless  ball busting  post show  and some people  they don't know  how to talk to me  well when does it happen  because I'm not  I don't witness it  I'm not  I have nothing to say about it  for the most part  when I'm in the office  you know  with Sam  and Butcher  and Travis  who I share that office with  it's never happening  so when is it happening  it's just like  if you're gonna say it  if you're gonna say it  back it up  because it just  you know  it just looks like  you're just saying stuff  and we're all shaking our heads  going what the hell  is he talking about  what the hell  I have no idea  who's doing it  so I don't know 
[01:14:00]  who to point a finger at  I really don't  and we all fuck with everyone  am I supposed to like  walk around here  with a stick up my ass  because Danny talks about  fingering my baby  for 20 minutes every day  I honestly don't know  it's not a joke though  yeah but you know  but like I don't  like we're just  we went for the  Opie and Anthony show  like  talking about fingering  old double knuckle Ross  his fucking infant  newborn child  and Danny just  will not stop talking about  how he's gonna finger  his daughter  well you know what  Danny's a good boy  oh Uncle Paul 
[01:14:30]  I told him  that's how you  that's how you loosen someone up  do you think these guys  have an opportunity  with that one  do you think these guys  have it out for Steve  what are you asking me  yes  yes I do  why is that  I have no idea  why would the whole staff  gang up on you  I don't know  because that's what you're getting at  I don't know  I really don't know  I wish I could figure it out  I brainwashed them all  no I don't think  I honestly couldn't tell you  I honestly couldn't tell you  even away from the show though  Travis  Travis was at the party 
[01:15:00]  the other day  and he had his  his newborn little infant there  and he came up to me  and I said  so how's the proud papa feeling  and he goes  good good  and I said  when's he showing up  you're not the right dad  and poor Travis  is just like  I'm the father  sure Travis weighs  eight  that baby weighs  half of what you do  it's a ten pound baby  nothing like that  the only way  his wife got pregnant  was because they had to scissor  the coke logic writes  the wrestling accident  coke logic writes 
[01:15:30]  by the way  the keyboard gag  was fucking genius  so  you gotta love  the keyboard gag  Steve doesn't feel  part of the club  well yeah but  Steve  if Steve were part  of the club  he would think  he was getting  fucked with  E-Rock's part of the club  because we throw  his meals in the garbage  Travis is part of the club  because Danny says  he has sex  with his infant daughter  like how  can we include you  without you thinking  everyone's still  against you  you walk funny  and you have silly hair  and you have flack  Steve was in part 
[01:16:00]  of the club  and then he made it  abundantly clear  he didn't want to be  part of that club anymore  yes  he made it abundantly clear  because you have too many  things to do  exactly  or Nambla  and then when we  don't fuck with you  you say nobody's  talking to you  or you're not part  of the club  no that's not  I've never said that  I never said that at all  I'm quite content  being not fucked with  I'm quite content  being left to my own  devices and doing  my fucking job  absolutely  so then don't think  that everyone's out  to get you  and that we're  conspiring against you 
[01:16:30]  and that we're  feeding these guys  misinformation  it's just not  happening dude  I think everything  that's happening  is of your own doing  I didn't spread a big  rumor around Syria  saying hey  I hear Steve's  taking off every money  no you were  legitimately taking off  every money  the wording  in your emails  the words  at staff meetings  that we have  these are the words  that we're using  so if I say  yeah  I think Steve's  taking off  like every money  for the foreseeable  future  I have news for you  six to eight weeks 
[01:17:00]  is the foreseeable  future  so no one's  spreading bullshit  no one's trying  to conspire  six to eight weeks  that is the foreseeable  future  six weeks  six weeks  foreseeable future  and that's how  I intended it  now that there's  a problem with it  sure  but six weeks  foreseeable future  that's exactly what  that's really what  I was referring to  so no one's saying  anything more than that  absolutely  yesterday somebody  said it was a year  no Steve  you're not listening  what was said  was that  how much time  does he have  and he said  he has a year's worth  Steve taking a year 
[01:17:30]  and he has a year's worth  is two completely  different things  so no one ever said  that  no one ever said  that you were taking  a year's worth  you guys did say it  we said  he could be taking a year  yes he could be  why would we say  no he couldn't be  like would we really say  no he said foreseeable  future which means  six weeks  that's not what that means  foreseeable doesn't mean  six weeks  it means it's open ended  and he has 51 days  and there's 52 weeks  in a year  it's a statement intended  to illicit  even 20 straight Mondays  would be a major problem 
[01:18:00]  of course  and I was never going to do it  for 20 straight Mondays  and then we went  wait  he could possibly be doing it  for a year  no  never  well whatever  there's a major  difference between  what you're saying  and what you wrote  you feel very isolated  from everybody here  absolutely  everybody here  everybody  why is that  like what is it  I have no idea  you know what dude  I have no idea  what the fuck I did  you seem very sad to me  and very  and I'm not saying  look there are times  where I understand  look  you  like I'm listening  to your argument here  I understand why people 
[01:18:30]  thought that email  said what it did  because it was worded  terribly  it was very badly worded  and I see why people  would think that you  meant everyone  I really would  but it's like  you just strike me  as being very sad  and feeling very disconnected  from everybody  everybody here  it's like you walk  into a war zone  every time you come to work  absolutely  but why  I wish I could tell you  I wish I could tell you  I just get  I get  I really get a feeling  that I'm being  like fucking pushed  I've been having that feeling  for I don't even know  how many months  like I'm being  fuck  I'm just being like  I'm really being  like you know 
[01:19:00]  sort of distanced  so I can just say  fuck y'all  I'm out  I'm out  so  and that's really  how I feel  that's absolutely  how I feel  and if I'm completely  unjustified and crazy  and out of my mind  then so be it  but like it was just said  like if we mess with you  there's a problem  and if we don't mess with you  then it's like  why am I being isolated  so like there was a point  where you would fuck with us  just as bad as we would fuck  with you and everyone else  you would walk into my phone booth  and pour salt on my head  because I made fun of you  so 
[01:19:30]  and all of a sudden  that stopped  and  is that why you're losing your hair  who me?  Travis loses his hair  oh yeah  everywhere except his back  what a fucking creep  what he's got a hairy back  it's just disgusting  I hope it falls out  I hope your hair falls out  in two weeks  oh shit  do you have a hairy back  no  I absolutely don't  I hope your fucking hair falls out  like Michael Jackson  after a Pepsi commercial  big dumb scar  that's great  get some follicles  yes 
[01:20:00]  but the cheaper version  where they fucking  they staple them  into your head  fucking Mary  so now what  how does this cute bit  bit end  well it's  cute bit  it's been going on  we all feel this uncomfortable tension  and it's like  it sucks to feel that way  and there's stuff that the people  don't know that went on  that we know  that went on  you know what I mean  it's like between  different people  which I think sometimes  the staff does rise your heart  I think sometimes 
[01:20:30]  you handle things very badly  I mean there's certain things  that I've even told you  I think that was handled terribly  yeah and you've been very honest  and I've really curbed that behavior  in lieu of some of that  I absolutely have  I think you cause your own problems  Steve  I'm in therapy  there's some weird thing  that happens with you  and communicating stuff  because I believe  what you're saying today  but man it wasn't perceived that way  you know  in the last couple weeks  or whatever it would be  and we all do  selfish or self-centered shit  at work  all of us do it  it's a big outlet 
[01:21:00]  for our shitty personalities  and it's very easy  to point it out  in all of us  but it's almost like  when you get called out on it  it kind of  it's like you get very defensive  at times you just gotta go  you know what  I was being selfish  or I was being  fucked up the way I handled that  or I was kind of  putting my interest  you know what I mean  it's like there are times  when it's okay to admit that  I will absolutely admit  that I am narcissistic  vain  selfish  and fucking crazy  in more than one respect  Steve  you fit in perfectly  yeah well 
[01:21:30]  I would think so  but you know  but for some reason  and maybe it's  and maybe it's my own  fucking neurosis  that I feel like  I'm being fucking ostracized  it could be  it could be  or maybe just nobody  talks about it  and you know  there's just sort of like  alright we're done with him  well there were things  even that I tried to talk to you about  which were not as much  connected to me  as to other guys  yeah they're unspoken things  and they're unspoken stuff  and things that were talked about  and that kind of  you know  I felt like  why did they do that  like why did Steve handle it like that 
[01:22:00]  like you know  I wasn't even privy  to all that was going on  but I was like  why did Steve do that  like you know what I mean  like I couldn't find a reason  that made sense to me  why certain things  were handled that way  like I thought like  ah he should have  handled that one differently  do you know what I mean  I'm not attacking you dude  I'm just  I know you're not  I don't hear an attack in that  I just  you know maybe  you know  the communication around here  you know could improve  or maybe it's  maybe it's not going to be improved  I don't know  it's hard  I don't know  it's hard to like  when the staff  rides you hard  I see it 
[01:22:30]  but I also see  when you do something  that I think is  is like  ah  that's  and believe me  I'm not saying  I'm above it  or I'm above it  but when you do something  that's really fucked up  or self-centered  it's like  you got to be able  to be called out on that  and go god damn it  that was fucked up  I put myself before the show  and I shouldn't have done that  like you know what I mean  because then it's a lot easier  to yell at Dan or Sam  or anybody who fucks with you  where it goes beyond  where it's comfortable  where it should happen  you know what I mean  like if those guys are riding you  beyond what is appropriate  for the show  I think you could yell that for it  but it's like  in the same token  when you're doing something 
[01:23:00]  that's putting yourself  before the show  you got to kind of  own up to it  at top when it happens  sure  and I you know what  and I have no problem  owning up to my own  fucking stupid behavior  I really don't  I have no problem doing that  hmm  it's part of being honorable  you have to be  you have to own up  to your own shitful behavior  if that's what you're guilty of  us  oh  oh  Jesus Christ 
[01:23:30]  didn't you got to hear that  for a  there are things that went on  which may be better  for off air  I don't know  I mean again  for the audience  nothing that's you know  you know  no sexual assault  but just things that went on  fortunately  yeah  I mean that would be  much more fun to talk about  we all spit in our hands  and Jack  but I just  I couldn't for the life of me  see why it was handled that way  like why did it get to that point  with you know  with the guys  I mean  I just  I don't  I don't  yeah 
[01:24:00]  I don't want to get into it  I wrote  I wrote an email  once  and it  that was my whole  viewpoint on  the situation  and  I still  adhere to those  thoughts  ideas  and everything  behind it  you know  this is  unfortunately stuff  that will have to come out  in a book someday  but  no  mine  which I'm working on now  I tease of course  it's just  you know  behind the scenes shit  is all it is  but  there has been some  I guess  resentment 
[01:24:30]  things like that  which is made for a  tough working environment  between some of the people  here  so it's  you know  and it's what it is  it's not even  it's  it's  it's beyond  it's water under the bridge  but  you know  it's done its damage  so that's kind of  where it is right now  I have a fine  working relationship  with people here  and  I keep it that way  it's how I  you know  it's how I roll  as I like to put it  it's what I say now  it's how I roll  it's very genuine 
[01:25:00]  I like when you say that  yeah  yeah  it's very genuine  well we gotta take a break  Travis has the clip  from yesterday  in regard to  a year's worth of Mondays  wow  leave it to Travis  he's got the fucking  glove that doesn't fit  what do you got  a Mondays off  started at June 12th  and then he's asking  what about the  fictitious  guest  issue email  I have no idea 
[01:25:30]  remember I asked you  I sent you a text  why wasn't the staff  told about  yeah and they were  I do not have an email  dude I send it to everybody  do you have a copy  of what you sent out  I absolutely do  just print a copy  of it and we'll  keep it vague  but it would vindicate you  if you had one  I do  absolutely  I didn't go into specifics  why because I was told  that I wasn't  going into specifics  but I did specifically say  don't say specific  twice in a second  I don't  yeah  I mean there's three  I didn't get an email  Eric and me were told  about it because we had  to do a thing  we were told about it  in advance 
[01:26:00]  but there was no  email  all I was told was  someone would not  be coming in  yeah  so everyone's  saying they get  an email  I've got it  I've got it  we gotta take a break  anyway  could you have it  printed out  we'll just finish it up  on the next break  real quick  we'll just give it  a quick synopsis  is that cool  everybody  if you just  print it out  and we finish it up  I gotta piss  so what are we doing  I don't know  I thought we were  going to take a break  we're going to take a break  and stare around  uncomfortably at each other  have we been going  an hour and 36 minutes 
[01:26:30]  no  that's silly  the clock is wrong  all of them  not if I turn  a camera on  you're a dunce  I really am a  fucking cunt hat  if you turn a camera on  then see the show  continues  and then it can't be  uncomfortable  when you go to break  see  that works  are we playing  that other clip  I got confused  I tapped out  I can play it  if you want  what clip do you have  Travis  play it  if we said it yesterday  just play it  a year's worth of Mondays  okay let's hear  wait Steve  I thought this Monday thing 
[01:27:00]  was for a few Mondays  no no no  for the foreseeable future  possibly for  a year 52 weeks  possibly  for real  oh yes  he rocked for real  52  he gets a paid  so our executive producer  is now working  four days a week  well that's somebody  else speculating  you know  that's speculative  that's completely speculative  yeah I'll give it that  well the word possibly  was used in there Steve  yeah  but it's also  possibly  he could  he could  use  50  possibly 
[01:27:30]  but possibly  it could mean  you know  8 weeks  when you have  80  days that are  potential  sick days  but I never said that  I mean  and neither did Sam  he just said potentially  because  because that's  because it was so open ended  that for all  anybody knew  it might as well  have been  when someone  if I say dude  I'm going to take  every Friday off  for the foreseeable future  and I have  100 sick days  wouldn't you just assume  that I'm just going to be  taken every  Friday off  until I run out  possibly  the first thing  I would  the first thing 
[01:28:00]  I would say is  it's not a crazy thing  to assume  the first thing  I would say is  if you mean  every day  for the next year  no  does Kenny want in  oh no  there's no sense  to beat a dead horse  I think every reasonable man  can conclude  who's right  and who's wrong  here  alright  Steve talks about  being honorable  what would hurt  to just admit  maybe you made a mistake  I think I did  in my wording  of the original email  make a mistake 
[01:28:30]  make a mistake  by not being  by not being  more  more clear  as to my intentions  the original email  and every time  you spoke about it  after that  what I say  in staff meetings  is pretty much  to get people  off my back  so would it be  reasonable  with regards to this  you do it  to yourself  I'm sorry  wow  alright  so you do it  what do you have to say  and then he'll say  that the staff  is miscommunicating  on his behalf 
[01:29:00]  like dude  what are you talking about  man  no one's saying  anything  besides what you're saying  and then obviously  you sent an email out  in some regards  saying that  blaming the staff  for  mixing your words up  which completely  was not the case  and I have a big  problem with that  Kenny you're  an interrogative  Kenny's pretty much  an expert  at interrogation  anyone who's had  a fucking  lunch with him  knows that  what's your  take on it  no no  Steve just said  that  his intentions 
[01:29:30]  were miscommunicated  is that something  what you just said  yes  alright  so  so what  precisely  was miscommunicated  I should have been  more clear  with regard  to how many  of those  to how many  of those  Mondays  I was going to use  alright  so would it be fair  to say that  your intention  was to take off  every Monday  as long as you could  no  that wouldn't be  fair to say  no  that was not  my intention  and the fact 
[01:30:00]  that I didn't  outline it  more specifically  yeah that's my fault  there's a serious  conversation going on  here  all me and Jimmy  are doing  is looking at  at Clubstone  Kenny's dick  rubbing on the mic  how the mic stand  is rubbing against  his stupid peenie  his little wee wee  and Jimmy just  took a picture  look at this  there's a real  conversation going on  why you're rubbing  your cock on the mic stand  there's an ex-detective  rubbing his fucking  he's dry humping  the mic stand  that's why Kenny's 
[01:30:30]  leaning in so much  I'm sorry  I apologize  that's okay  very funny  Kenny  the only thing  in conclusion  in conclusion  in summation  is Steve agreed  to every point  you guys made  right  but then in the next breath  tried to get some wiggle room  yeah yeah  a little wiggle room  right  alright  that comes from a professional  you know he's been in the  interrogation room  so he was looking for  excuses of convenience  that's all that was  excuses of convenience  correct  I like that 
[01:31:00]  alright  thank you Kenny  alright  I can see that  I don't know  where do we go  from here with this  whatever  just kind of  just kind of go  yeah the email  was a little  I'll  I'll go  in summation  now  the email  that went to  the boss boss  was  a lot more  specific  even though it was vague  than the one  we got  that's why we didn't  turn around and say  holy shit Steve 
[01:31:30]  you can't take every  fucking Monday off  because if we got the one  the bosses got  we'd look at that  and said  holy shit  Steve's taking every  fucking Monday off  for who knows how long  it's open ended  that's why we didn't  complain or say  holy shit  we don't have an EP  for Monday  from now until  we don't even know when  so that  that's what I saw  and if you're saying  that you know  you erred  when you  when you wrote  that email  alright  I'll buy that  happens  that's all 
[01:32:00]  that was my summation  that's what I took away  from the whole thing  what you fucking  savages do  behind the scenes  is none of my  goddamn business  or my concern  I grab my backpack  and I run out of here  and I leave  I leave that  whooshing white smoke  that cartoon characters  leave when they  leave a room quickly  it's true  fuck it's amazing  but fucking  1031 he's  goose stepping  down the hall  then you alright  yeah I would just  you know  if accusations are made  then I just would like 
[01:32:30]  you know  just a little bit of backup  like you can't  I can't just run around  saying whatever I want  and I would just like  it to be the same  for everybody  so if there's accusations  of just non-stop  ball busting  behind the scenes  then at least have  a few examples  because it doesn't  I mean as far as  as I know  and from what I do  and from what I observe  I don't see it  I don't see it  because I can tell you  I used to see it  two years ago  yeah but you and I  don't occupy the same  the same real estate  anymore  okay but and then  80% of the guys  are in my office too  so when does it happen  and who's doing it 
[01:33:00]  I don't know  when it happens  and I don't know  who's doing it  because it happens  when I'm not around  I you know  so it happens on Mondays  but that's it  so if you're  Iraq there's no use  eating a dead horse  I'm just saying  if there's going to be  accusations that  like we pick on you  two you know  every day non-stop  well then just back it up 
[01:33:30]  that's all  because that's what you said  on the air  you do talk very vague  at times Steve  you gotta back up your stuff  because my fucking brain  is like a sieve  well write it down  that would help you out  you do talk vague  and I think you do  cause your own issues  I think I do too  maybe not every time  but  no I don't every time  but yeah sometimes I'm  but I think you do cause  a lot of your own  we all have our foibles  hey that's my word  I know  I used it  that's why I used  Jimmy's voice  when I did it  I used one of  Jimmy's voices  I used Ted's voice 
[01:34:00]  while I stole your line  it's a really confusing  yeah yeah  I used to really fuck  everybody up there  I was being vague  people are saying  people are saying  everything from radio gold  to enough already  so why don't we  and somewhere in between  we can never figure out  you fuckers  I vote for shit  you vote for shit  alright  alright  I think this was  very healthy right  it's always healthy  to get things out  yeah we'll just clear up  that email thing  after the break  and then that'll be that  it's like picking a scab  it's very healthy 
[01:34:30]  see it's not healthy  cause Danny wants to continue  there was no email  what Danny is saying  is  no email  Sam's saying no email  Travis is saying no email  Steve is very adamanty  he sends out an email  Iraq of course  will be on the fence  like he is with everything  exactly  breaking it  absolutely  trying to balance  his fatness  like Humpty Dumpty  Humpty Dumpty  I'm sorry  fucking Iraq  he's losing weight  can you have an opinion  on something Iraq  Jesus Christ  exactly  besides what bacon  tastes like  we all know 
[01:35:00]  your opinion on that  it's Y with a U  and a bunch of M's  fucking guy  Iraq by the way  is indestructible  he really is  he panics  cause he just wants  to agree with  every single person  in this room  I know  Steve just  Danny's point  about the email  is  oh he writes in here  as we kill him  yes  he's been getting  crushed  and he's just  sitting in the seat  I couldn't see him  behind Steve  he's tearing up 
[01:35:30]  at the trans fat story  on channel 5  Iraq can you make  a decision  did you get an email  or not  everyone else is saying  they did not get an email  no  no email  no  and you absolutely  sent it  I remember writing it  of the handful of things  I fucking remember  in my life  I remember writing that  I'm hitting send  alright that's a good  we'll go to break  with this  that's good  we'll read the email  next Steve  fair enough  I think it's fair  fair enough  what's Alanis Morissette  doing

[01:36:30]  shitting there  or pissing  pissing  before she goes on stage  she likes to take  her leak  that's nice  I was saying she's 35  yeah  that's it  come on bullshit  she married  she was engaged  to Ryan Reynolds  but he left her  for Scarlett Johansson  do you blame her  look like she's  taking a dump  in that picture  that really does  that's fucking lovely  nice  I'd be singing  thank you  get it  we'll tie in  her song  that's good  Jimmy  is your wife 
[01:37:00]  still crying  is she alright  no  no upsetting  loved ones  I have no idea  she's probably  she's pissed off  I know that  no upsetting  loved ones  on the program  is she pissed  because you're  misrepresented to her  too  oh my god  he told me  he had every Monday  Jesus age  Christ  I would love  to get her signed  but I  you know  we don't go there  it's fine  that was a joke  Steve  Jesus Christ  no look  I love my wife  I don't like  seeing her upset  yeah I understand that  I could appreciate that 
[01:37:30]  yeah that's where  it gets like  alright  we'll take a break  and we'll read that email  please don't have a date  July 21st  it'll be embarrassing  for everybody  or July 22nd  because that hasn't  happened yet  right  or the 19th  because it was  my birthday  aww  how great  I will agree  if the email  is dated  July 21st  Jim was not  was not included  on the email  because it  included birthday  details  okay that's fine  wait  it's a letter  from Doc 
[01:38:00]  what  he's in the  Old West  when was this  email sent  Saturday or Sunday  and me and  Ann got it too  yep  oh  interesting  when did you  find out  this info  let me see  what's going on  Saturday  sir  Saturday  sorry  we're gonna go  with  check Saturday  or Sunday  Saturday  I don't remember  alright  we're at Sunday  I could search  with my  email  is the title  is the title  of the email  Monday  guests  plus Jim's  birthday  guests  okay  then you  want me  to read 
[01:38:30]  it  oh  shit  that doesn't  sound like  something  you know what  I'll tell you this much  if it was gonna  back up Steve  I don't think  Travis would have  said okay  you want me to  read it  he'd have hit  delete  okay  blank  has been  cancelled  so now  the only guest  for Monday  is Jay Oakerson  who will need  a plug sheet  however  we have  some surprises  for Jim's  birthday  and then it  lists  all of the  surprises  for Jim's  birthday  and then  the email  is over  okay  so it doesn't  say why  he was  cancelled 
[01:39:00]  it doesn't  say anything  that we  needed to  know  I wasn't  I wasn't  I was told  not to make  that information  public  I Oak knew  I think  Ant knew  and that's it  I wasn't told  I was told  not to  to  but you said  that you  emailed  the staff  about it  that  and so that  we would all  know the  details  no I said  Jim asked  me why  I didn't  email  that the  guy was  cancelled  I'm alright  spider  no the  problem  there Steve  is that  my issue 
[01:39:30]  was that  there were  certain info  the staff  had to have  for replay  and all that  stuff  because of  concerns  that were  had  and there's  no way  they could  have known  that  because we  came in  Monday  and I'm  like well  was this  handled at  the end  of last  week  or as  soon as  it was  made  known  and  like how  is the  staff  knowing  not to  have  certain  things  on the  air  if  they  aren't  told  like  according  to that  they would  have  had  stuff  on the  air  all  weekend  hypothetically 
[01:40:00]  let's  say  Travis  pulled  something  I could  have  played  yeah  exactly  so  that  could  have  been  a  problem  and  this  email  that  says  person  has  been  cancelled  that  doesn't  yeah  I was told  he was  cancelled  and I was told  not to give out  the reason  that he was  but you didn't  say  and it  don't  replay  certain  aspects  none of  I wasn't  told not to  replay  certain  aspects  I wasn't  told that  but you knew  there was an  issue  that could  erupt  into  some  legal  cloud 
[01:40:30]  if  the  person  was  on  or  replay  and this  is not  the company  being  paranoid  this is  one of  the  situations  where  it's  like  yeah  I  definitely  got  where  they were  coming  from  no  if  we've  been  bitten  by  the  same  German  shepherd  a few  times  we're  going  to be  a little  leery  of  German  shepherds  and we  have  been  bitten  a few  times  so  we  went  and  dick  first  with  peanut  butter  while  he  was  growling  idiots  the way  I read  it  when I  got it  was  don't  have  this  guy  don't  shit  I don't  even  know  what  I  don't 
[01:41:00]  have  this  person  on  as  a  guest  that's  how  I  interpreted  it  okay  considering  he  was  a  guest  and there  was  audio  and that  audio  was  where  the  problem  came  from  then  the  staff  should  be  told  this  is  off  limits  and  I  would  assume  that  you  were  told  that  some  of  the  audio  was  verboten  as far  as being  played  I was  told  this  guy  was  not  you 
[01:41:30]  weren't  given  a  reason  why  this  guy  wasn't  going  to be  on  our  show  but  I  was  told  that  was  not  conveyed  publicly  that  was  not  made  widely  known  I  understand  but  there's  a  difference  between  explaining  to the  staff  why  he's  not  going  to  be  on  the  show  and  telling  the  staff  look  because  of  certain  things  that  came  up  do  not  play  this  audio  you  know  I  wasn't  told  to  eradicate  the  stuff  but  that's  something  I  think  an 
[01:42:00]  executive  producer  should  put  two  and  two  together  if  the  boss  tells  you  there's  a  problem  that  could  erupt  into  something  based  on  a  guest  and  his  appearance  and  his  appearance  shouldn't  you  know  look  we  gotta  wipe  this  out  like  there  have  been  times  I've  turned  around  and  gone  holy  shit  do  not  play  that  there  was  a  time  I  think  Butcher  played  something  or  it's  oh yeah  and  there's  just  been  times  people  have  played  things  where  I'm  like  oh my  god  are  they  crazy  we  just  got  fucking 
[01:42:30]  bitched  out  about  this  and  they  knew  they  knew  and  you  know  that's  kind  of  the  situation  we  had  I  think  you  could  easily  deduce  that  if  a  guest  was  a  problem  if  there  was  going  to  be  a  problem  based  on  what  he  had  said  in  a  previous  appearance  that  that  previous  appearance  shouldn't  be  played  and  when  was  that  email  sent  to  Travis  that  was  on  Saturday  okay  which  is  fine  but  like  Saturday  what  time  I'm  not  nitpicking  I'm  curious  it's 
[01:43:00]  the  fact  I  think  it's  more  the  fact  that  like  you  know  like  Monday  morning  it's  just  like  hey  should  we  play  this  and  I'm  just  like  yeah  why  not  and  it's  just  like  well  because  of  this  and  I'm  like  I  don't  even  know  that  I  didn't  know  either  that  was  a  big  surprise  so  it's  just  like  maybe  if  the  details  aren't  for  everybody  that's  fine  but  I  don't  think  there's  a  problem  in  saying  hey  let's  all  be  cautious  because  this  happened  can I  ask  why  you  didn't  I  want 
[01:43:30]  to  know  because  I  was  in  communication  with  Steve  Blatter  and  you know  and  stuff  like  that  on  Friday  about  this  became  an  issue  sometime  on  Friday  I  don't  know  when  but  I  have  an  email  text  between  Blatter  and I  at  like  7.50  p.m.  which  was I  think  Chicago  time  so  how  can  we  get  you  should  have  sent  this  out  Friday  night  because  of  possible  replays  on  Friday  night  or  Saturday  morning  I  didn't  know  that's  what  they  wanted  done  I  didn't  know  that's  what  they  wanted  done  I  thought  they  wanted 
[01:44:00]  the  guest  pulled  that's  what  I  got  from  all  the  correspondents  they  wanted  the  guest  pulled  were  you  given  the  reason  why  yes  so  like  knowing  that  that's  what  I  mean  they  wanted  the  guest  pulled  but  they  told  you  why  so  based  on  why  it  should  have  been  known  to  not  replay  certain  audio  it  just  should  have  been  known  that's  something  like  like  two  and  two  it's  six  it's  not  shit  because  what 
[01:44:30]  happened  math  what  happens  is  if  if  the  company  says  look  they've  gotten  this  notice  and  we  still  replay  stuff  that  we  could  have  just  as  easily  yanked  I  mean  that's  a  major  problem  because  that's  like  saying  we're  ignoring  what  the  company  said  and  what  the  outside  party  said  that's  a  big  problem  I  understand  that  but  that  was  never  communicated  to me  and  if  I  was  supposed  to  assume  that  then  I  didn't  I  think  as  you  have  to  on  that  one  that's  a  big  one  it's  something  like 
[01:45:00]  you  know  you  look at  something  and  you  kind  of  think  hey  now  here's  where  I  gotta  go  in  and  tell  my  guys  you  know  I  got  this  issue  that  came  up  and  here's  how  we  have  to  handle  it  and  there's  the  and  there's  been  situations  like  that  before  where  someone  said  get  the  audio  out  get  it  out  now  and  that's  absolutely  what  has  happened  but  this  was  don't  book  the  guest  this  was  don't  book  the  guest  and  it  was  canceled  and  you  know  within  minutes  of  getting  that  I  was  on  the  phone 
[01:45:30]  with  the  but  I  been  through  we're  going  in  circles  based  on  why  the  guest  to  let  these  guys  know  I  understand  that  and  if  it  was  articulated  that  way  I  would  have  I  think  they  want  you  to  not  be  like  just  a  filter  yeah  yeah  you  have  to  you  have  to  know  like  like  if  you're  told  by  the  bosses  you  have  to  be  the  guy  that  knows  to 
[01:46:00]  then  tell  the  rest  of  the  guys  all  right  here's  the  information  I  got  now  here's  what  there's  there's  information  that  you  get  now  you  have  to  take  that  information  and  kind  of  figure  shit  out  and  then  disperse  it  amongst  the  staff  that's  part  of  you  know  make  sure  the  show  is  well  protected  as  you 
[01:46:30]  do  that  yeah  without  a  doubt  man  we  were  a  little  vulnerable  yeah  that  was  we  had  our  soft  bellies  laying  open  for a  while  it  wasn't  terrible  because  a lot  you  I  it  wasn't  like  you  know  crisis  but  it  should  have  been  taken  who  edited  it  which  did  anybody  replay  it  yes  it  didn't  replay  Dave  see  from  New York  city  wants  I  just  like  to  remind  Jimmy  his  vacation 
[01:47:00]  time  of  Tuesdays  between  8  and  8  15  is  coming  up  oh  that  is  what  you  grab  yes  you got  tips  on  that  that's  right  I've  got  a trip  planned  you got  your  vacation  starting  in two  minutes  I  certainly  do  I'm  going  down  to  Del  Frisco's  and I'm  going to  make time  with the  waitress  and then  come back  up by  8 15  I like  to make  time with  the Del  Frisco's  waitstaff  I like  to get  to know  them  is it safe  to say  that sometimes  communication  gets garbled  between you  and the  staff  sometimes 
[01:47:30]  okay so  how is it  that we  have  communication  problems  the  communication  gets  broken down  between  staff and  me  but I'm  saying  if  like  if  the  problem  is  you're  not  communicating  to us  the  you know  even  any  issue  at  all  how is  it  then  that  we  have  a  problem  communicating  like  that's  just  what  I  want  to  differentiate  because  I  get  told  a lot  of  times  that  our  communication  skills  need  work  but  meanwhile  it  seems  like  the  only  times  where  communication  skills  need  work  is  when  the  staff  and  you  are  communicating  that's 
[01:48:00]  why  there have  been  plenty  of  times  where  I  articulate  just fine  what needs  to get  done  and what  has to  get  done  and they  just  don't  do it  what's  that  I  heard  drinking  problem  I  said  it's 
[01:48:30]  like  saying  the  staff  has  a  drinking  problem  because  Danny  drinks  you know  that's a  great  example  there  Travis  you're  saying  that  the  staff  has  a  communication  issue  because  you  have  a  communication  issue  you  just  do  stay  quiet  in  there  silent  partner  you  really  make  things  very  crystal  clear  you  fucking  water  muddier  dummy  Jesus  Christ  your  baby  throws 
[01:49:00]  up  and  is  smarter  than  you  drools  and  it  can't  hold  its  head  up  and  it's  still  smarter  than  you  right  now  he  is  a  terrible  example  oh my  god  it's  example  stink  really  awful  we're  going off  yesterday  on one  movie  throws another  one in there  out of left field  just trying to diversify  you stink  he's doing arts and crafts  he's holding  one of those  post-it  little  what do they call  it  post-it  notes  you look like the  silence of the lambs  guy  you look like 
[01:49:30]  jame gum  oh no  no  you look like  after hannibal  actor hung  the cop  up  he's holding  his arms  open  with a  whole  thing  a post-it  note  it looks  cool though  right  it's like  a kid  he's  sitting  in class  cut it  up  yeah  well  i think steve  could communicate  better to the staff  to be honest  with you  yes  if the whole  staff is saying  like  i don't think  they're  ganging up  on you  i think they get 
[01:50:00]  frustrated because  of the communication  i'm so fucking  tired of the  naked cat  we get it  no i don't even  want to hear this  he's gonna be  running for  the mayor's office  for mayor  good  naked cowboy  for mayor  on a goof ticket  and the news  is picking up  on it  i'm gonna be  the best  hey  she was on  hey  there she is  hey we had her  on yesterday  i got a picture  with her  brooke something  she's into me  with her  debbie gibson hat  kenny suggests  that we make  steve apologize  what  no 
[01:50:30]  kenny wrote it  wow  in fucking  in psychopath  non-script  handwriting  every fucking  you know  everything kenny  writes looks  like a hostage  note  yeah you should  just walk around  with cut out  pieces of magazine  i'm the shark  skin suit  killer  why should steve  apologize  kenny  now that we're  past eight o'clock  without a break  oh my god  kenny  no you're always  good getting 
[01:51:00]  apologies out of  people  jesus steve  i mean kenny  i don't even know  what i'm saying  anymore  exactly  even like  for instance  this last  instant  you know  he  doesn't want  to take  responsibility  for it  wow  yeah you might  have caused  your own  problem here steve  that's true  for real  i'm a self  destructive  individual  it's not that  you're self  destructive  it's that  when you  fuck up  or whatever  it's kind of  hard for you  to go  wow  that was a  tremendous  blunder  you'll say  it like  as a very 
[01:51:30]  casual admission  but specifically  to go wow  i really should  have done that  because that  was a big one  i really do  believe you  weren't going  to take  every monday  off for the  next year  but you  didn't really  communicate that  whatsoever to  anyone until  today  which caused  the issue  that has  been discussed  for well over  an hour now  why didn't  anybody ask  why didn't  anybody see  it came to  our head  yesterday  well don't  forget no one  got that email  first of all  and danny said  you're taking  every monday off  steve and you  said yes i  have the days  when did i say  that 
[01:52:00]  in the staff  meeting  which is obviously  you say things  in the staff  meeting  just to get  people off  your back  which we heard  today  that didn't  help your case  by the way  it definitely  didn't  well because  the staff  meeting is  1% information  90%  99%  91%  but see all  the ball  busting and  stuff is one  thing on the  air  the staff  meeting is  where you  should be  serious and  not just say  stuff to get  everyone off  your back  that's what  you should be  saying on the  air  there's approximately  4% ball  busting in staff 
[01:52:30]  meetings  and what was  the other  percent of  non-ball  busting  work and  discussion  no what's  the number  96  do we go  96  where's there  a gray area  where it's  92 and then  like you know  4%  give or take  a couple percentage  points  you need a  plus or minus  1% is  E-Rock  drinking free  sodas  ah you rock  piggy boy  like soda  well let's  ask Elliot  Ness  shoes  what do  you think  that's  one of  I'm surprised 
[01:53:00]  that Kenny  is kind of  frustrated with  Steve  Kenny  seems to be  frustrated  Kenny's a  facts guy  though  Kenny's an  organized  facts guy  Kenny  and I mean  F-A-C-T-S  not facts  Kenny is a  factual guy  who lives and  dies on facts  and if you've  ever traveled  with him  you know  that's all  he does  he's talking  about facts  with what  Steve's saying  here today  I like  Steve  but you know  he's just  caught between  a rock  and a hard  place now  Kenny also  loves cliches  oh my god  he's a cliche  king  he really is  he loves  cliches  caught between  a rock  and my head  that's right 
[01:53:30]  there would be  no harm for him  to admit  his indiscretions  that's all  I'm saying  because it's  evident by  his babbling  for the last  hour and his  body language  what's the body  language  hold on  what's the body  language  he's been  biting his  lip  he's been  fumbling  with his  foo man  chew  he's been  tapping his  foot  he's been  shuffling in  his chair  and these  are things  that  are these  tells  you're told  you know  mean to look  for  something  yeah  yes  alright  they're tells 
[01:54:00]  what do they  say  he's nervous  and uncomfortable  with what's  going on  I'm nervous  and uncomfortable  in the studio  period  you do this  for a living  then you're  in the wrong  profession  no  it's been  11 years  11 years  actually no  I'm not in  here full time  Kenny  oh  you're a voice  guy  in the radio  in the studio  look behind 
[01:54:30]  in a room  with a microphone  and no windows  I'm great  because I feel  comfortable  but in a room  where I'm put on  the spot  with three guys  with razor sharp  width  where I'm going  to get eviscerated  if I say the wrong  thing  no I'm not  comfortable  alright  so then  what would be  the harm  to just admit  it and get it  over with  admit what  what specifically  would you like  me to admit  Kenny  just tell the truth  I did tell the truth  the truth will set you free  I did tell the truth  another one  oh my god  I didn't lie  at any point 
[01:55:00]  in this conversation  what about the  staffing  two seconds ago  we're not saying  you're lying  but there is  deception going on  yeah Steve  that was a little rough  I mean you want  people  it's hard to defend  you when you say  stuff like  I just say stuff  at staff meetings  to get them off  my back  that's a rough  gorilla  you can't say  that you tell us  things just to get  us off your back  and then say  oh the staff  is lying  and misconstrued  my information  misconstrued  by saying that  90% of the staff  meeting is ball  busting you  is a complete  fabrication  it's complete 
[01:55:30]  that is fab  not even close  no no no  again 4%  would it be  70% maybe  no no no  I would say  closer to 60%  no it's not 60%  Steve's saying  closer to 60%  it's approximately  4%  and then 1%  and then 95%  what's the 1%  is E-Rock  drinking free sodas  so you know  if you're gonna  like I said  is he aware  that you guys  all look at him  every time he goes  for another free sodas  I love that visual  more than anything  right now  he can't help himself  so he has to come  into the room 
[01:56:00]  all slumped over  he's got one of these  pockets  old piggy pockets  is E-Rock  drinking fat free  soda  like low  like diet  you gotta drink  diet Pepsi  good  that shit  cheetos  does Eric know  there's free ice cream  in the green room  oh Eric's the one  that alerted us to him  I didn't know that  oh yeah  what are we gonna  tell us  well we can sum it up  by rat spit  here from pal talk  he just writes  Steve created this  problem  so on and so forth  so  so on  that's true  I didn't mean it  when I wrote  ad infinitum 
[01:56:30]  can we please  please break  I have to pee  really bad  you sure  or are you just  saying that  I swear to god  I'm gonna piss my pants  now we don't know  what to believe  we gotta watch him  piss his pants then  everyone pull out  no we don't  he said it  no we don't Sam  I just said that  to get you off my bladder  I did  speaking of bladder  where is he  uh DC  yeah he's in DC today  what's he doing  I don't know  he's looking at  potential victims  yeah  you out

[02:11:00]  fat he is  and how he  loves his  free soda  and loves  eating  and blah  so we go  to break  why you  with a bunch  of M's  we go to  break  the door opens  it's Iraq  he's the first  one that comes  in during the  break with a  mouth full  of food  he's got a  mouth full  why would you  do that to  yourself  dude his  cheeks were  puffed out  and he's  chewing  with a  CD in his  hand  coming over  to hand  it over  and I  just looked  at him 
[02:11:30]  and was like  are you  eating  and Danny  just goes  why would  you do  that  why would  you come  in and  eating  and he's  like  so I  captured  some of  those moments  on video  I'll pull up  later on  the Hopi Radio  YouTube channel  it's a  mouth full  of carbs  you don't  want to  be abused  like you get  but he  comes in  eating  carbs  you know  that the  thank you  to Kevin  G  you know  that the  Tom Watson  situation  gets worse  no what  happened  a lot 
[02:12:00]  more people  all in  on that  right  with him  blowing  the  British  Open  oh yeah  like you  sort of  cared  yesterday  but I  mean if you  walked around  yesterday  everyone's  talking about  Tom Watson  and how  fucking close  he was  to winning  the British  Open  he's almost  60  I did not  know this  and I  did read  this late  last night  if Tom  Watson won  the British  Open  and it was  an 8 foot  putt  that's all  he needed  to do  or winning  the playoff  they were  going to  allow him  to continue  playing  they were  ready to  give him  a pass  to the  age  restriction  if he  won 
[02:12:30]  oh shit  I guess  the PGA  has some  kind of  age  restriction  where  you got  to bump  up  16  when you  hit  60  you're  done  and Tom  Watson  is pretty  much  two months  away  from  60  but  they're  like  well  if this  guy  wins  this  British  Open  we got  to  blow  that  off  and  allow  him  to  keep  being  eligible  for  the  British  Open  so  Kevin G  writes  did you  mention  the story  about  Watson  screwing  himself  out  of 10  more  years  of  eligibility  for  the  British 
[02:13:00]  Open  by  losing  they  were  ready  to  give  him  a  pass  to  the  age  restriction  if  you  won  love  the  show  fuck  Reverend  Al  you don't  think  they'll  give it  to him  even though  he missed  just one  putt  it was  one putt  away  now he's  going to  shoot 80s  every time  out  that was  once in a  lifetime  everything  was lining  up  except for  the putt  well so  we've  so yes  or no  oh yeah  yeah  yeah  so we've  seen it  I'm trying  to show  responsibility  I haven't 
[02:13:30]  because I'm  the ass  that usually  blows shit  up  Aaron Andrews  was filmed  new  through  a hotel  people  we've  seen the  video  and it's  unbelievable  to watch  Jimmy's  admitting to  it  Jimmy's  fessing  to the  crime  I'm the  video  kid  that's  what I  was doing  with the  sharpie  making sure  we could  go down  this road  and we've  seen it  it's  unbelievable  yeah  yeah  she's  completely  nude  doing  butt  exercises  bending  all the  way  over  she's  doing  her  hair  little  squats  short  squats  she does  and then  she does  this  thing  where she 
[02:14:00]  kind of  turns her  hip  toward the  mirror  and turns  her head  to look  at her  ass  and then  does  these  ass  clenches  and it's  really hot  you kind of  feel bad  that you know  obviously she's  being taped  and didn't  want to be  spanking  out a little  making  cumzies  to it  and yelling  whore  troll at me  unbelievable  where was that  taken  like what  state was  that even  in  I don't  know the  details  but I  mean  she was 
[02:14:30]  obviously  having a  very  private  moment  and it  sucks  and all  that  but wow  I bet you  that was  taken  through  I think  someone said  between the  two rooms  sometimes  there's a  door that  will connect  them  maybe there's  a fucking  peephole  in that  door  oh did  you see  that  okay  but then  she's  got a  guarantee  that she  keeps  that door  open  is there  a peephole  in that  door  or no  maybe  there's  not  maybe  on this  one  there  was  no  this  thing  looks  like  it's  a  it's  an  actual  hole  it  looks  like  a  hole  it  looks  like  a  hole  and  then  you  put  one  of  those  tiny 
[02:15:00]  cameras  in there  yeah  tiny  fucking  pin  camera  right  yeah  through there  the reason  why  we all  know  about  this  isn't  because  she  saw  that  she  was  being  filmed  it was  because  this  guy  decided  to  throw  it  on  the  internet  this  scumbag  it  wasn't  even  labeled  with  her  name  at  first  too  like  I  don't  think  the  guy  knew  what  he  had  oh  really  yeah  it  was  just  labeled  as  some  kind  of  blonde  or  some  shit  nah  I  think  he  knew  what  he  had  who  are  you  just  some  weird  voice  that  comes  out of  nowhere  we're  trying to  do  radio  I  don't 
[02:15:30]  know  you  I'm  sorry  Travis  I  just  heard  it  was  labeled  when  it  first  made  the  rounds  as  blonde  in  there's  a  hell  of  a  link  to  click  on  he  must  have  known  who  it  was  to  fucking  yeah  I  guess  I 
[02:16:00]  and  girls  that  look  like  they  have  certain  things  that  other  girls  wouldn't  have  that's  just  what I'm  saying  sure  why not  not getting  specific  no problem  sunglasses  someone's  going to  explain the  British  opening  because I  want to  make sure  we got 
[02:16:30]  the  details  right  go  Jordan  and  Weehawk  in  New  Jersey  hey  guys  yeah  it  has nothing  to do  with the  age  restriction  so  that  if  you  had  won  everybody  wins  gets  10  year  exemption  all  right  I  understand  that  but  it  was  his  eligibility  just  about  up  but  if  he  won  he  would  have  got  another  10  years  right  yeah  plus  he  would  have  jumped  into  the  top  50  in  the  world  rankings  which  would  have  let  him  play  on  regular  PGA  tour  event  not  just  the  10  shit  he  ruined  everything  by missing  that  putt  that  choke  artist  are  you  a  golf 
[02:17:00]  fan  there  Jordan  yeah  I  am  how much  does it  hurt  and  I  don't  even  give  a  shit  about  Tom  Watson  I  never  met  him  nothing  but  that  moment  was  just  brutal  to  watch  yeah  I  was  rooting  for him  the  whole  way  that  sucked  but  I 
[02:17:30]  the  oldest  guy  to  win  a  major  I  think  was  43  years  old  that 's  17  years  past  that  that's  crazy  I  think  golf  is  one  of  those  sports  where  those  huge  moments  aren't  going to  bypass  like  you know  the Giants  win a  pennant  an individual  Tiger Woods  moment isn't  going to be  the sports  story of  the century  maybe  when he  breaks  all the  records 
[02:18:00]  yes  it's  got to  be  Cinderella  boy  but  an old  dude  winning  the  British  Open  which  is  they  say  is  the  toughest  of  all  the  majors  to  begin  with  because  the  wind  and  all  the  fucking  rain  that  happens  over  there  but  you're  not  going to  get  people  turning  cars  over  you need  rioting  to make  a sports  moment  you hear  what  Brian  Kilmeade  did  what a  name  that's  a hell  of a  name  he hurt  himself  Kilmeade  we know  this guy 
[02:18:30]  his homeroom  teacher  was constantly  being shot  Kilmeade  Brian  you got  it  Kilmeade  he's on  Fox and  Friends  I think  he's been on  the show  who is he  one of the  guys from Fox  and Friends  has been on  the show  I'm not  sure which  one  well he  said that  well he  had to  apologize  for saying  Americans  keep marrying  other species  other species  he still has  a job  who is he  referencing  we're gonna  find out  here's the 
[02:19:00]  original clip  during discussion  of people  who are  married  being less  likely to get  Alzheimer's  on July  8th  I find  this somewhat  different  limited to the  Finns and  Swedes  to come up  with something  don't look at me  pal  because that's  we are  we're  we're  we keep  marrying  other species  and other  ethics  are you sure  you're not  suffering  from some  of the  causes of  dementia  right now  the Swedes  have pure  genes  because they 
[02:19:30]  marry other  Swedes  because that's  the rule  Finland  Finns  marry other  Finns  so they  have a pure  society  in America  we marry  everybody  so we marry  Italians  and Irish  does not apply  to us  amazing deduction  Kelly  he should be  fired  he probably  meant  nationality  he meant  nationalities  and ethnicities  but what he's  saying he really  is kind of  saying  he's doing  a Jimmy the  Greek thing  he's saying  that certain  countries  have better 
[02:20:00]  more pure  genealogy  than the  United States  does  what was the  point of that  discussion  what was the  whether his  staff likes him  and treats him  with respect  oh he said  that 95%  of Swedes  it was a  study that  said  people who  were married  at 40  or so  were less  likely to  have  Alzheimer's  and dementia  when they're  older  but I guess  the study  took place 
[02:20:30]  in Sweden  or Finland  maybe we're  saying where  the genes  are more  consistent  so that  study would  be more  accurate  as opposed  to America  again species  was probably  a misstep  he probably  meant to  say different  ethnicities  and different  nationalities  where the genes  wouldn't be as  consistent  or pure  because  you have  different  it's hard  to say  Italians  Irish  Jews  black  you know  Spanish  mixing in  there's not  a consistency  in the genes  what the fuck  did he do wrong  if that's what  he meant  but why should  that make a  difference  we're all equal  and everybody  is the same  and there's no  difference in 
[02:21:00]  anything  now when it  comes to  genealogy  and disease  and blacks  are at higher  risk for certain  things  oh stop it  you racist  we're all the  same  yes exactly  I was being  sarcastic  Anthony  my new character  and that was me  stupid plow right  ahead despite the  joke Jimmy  why don't white  guys get  why don't white  people get  lupus  white people  get lupus  but not as much  as black people  I don't even know  who lupus is  I think my  grandmother had  lupus  why don't they  why don't black  what's the disease  black people get  sickle cell 
[02:21:30]  sickle cell  what about the  lupus  I don't know  no the lupus  lupus  blacks and whites  yeah yeah  so it's the  sickle cell  yeah the sickle cell  is what black  people  for real or we  mostly black people  get that  no no  more black people  than white people  sickle cell  is absolutely  a black person  but lupus  not so much  that's a  yeah I think  that's you know  pretty  by the way  fuck Ron  Bennington  we'll get to  that later  wow  wow  there's a  showstopper  that is a 
[02:22:00]  fucking tease  and a half  wow  alright  wow  after the break  yes  during your  vacation time  I will come  back from  vacation  to explain  when you take  vacation time  today  we're all  confused  and we're  very concerned  because the show  has to continue  running  I know  it's 847  I mean obviously  I'm way over  my vacation time  so I was thinking  915 to 922  I was taking the  extra two minutes  to go down to  Del Frisco's  and do a little  bit of flirting 
[02:22:30]  flirting with the lady  they're all hot  they're all hot  down there  I've been down  there a few  times  I actually ate  down there  with Anthony  Michael Hall  last week  oh  you might have  heard of him  which one is  Del Frisco's  downstairs  a fantastic  restaurant  oh yeah  that place  rules  and the girls  are fucking  smoking there  you guys actually  ate somewhere  together  yeah  it's crazy  I wasn't I  invited  I think we were  in the middle  of negotiations  we had to be  with each other  we hold each  other like 
[02:23:00]  orangutans  when they're  scared  that's our  negotiation time  we just hold  each other  there's a lot  of love you man  I'm frightened  and then we go  back to  what we are  whatever  Jesus  longest shit  in history  I'm going home  holy shit  really Danny  what the fuck  did you take a  picture of it  to prove that  you actually  shitted  everything has  to be proven  around here  is it a hot one  did you have to  wait for the  radiator to cool  down  before you pop  the cap  it's not so much  that it was  impressive  it was just  there was just  a mess in there  so I was like  I can let that

[02:25:00]  man  you're a gay  man  that's right  I am  and so they  thought I had  AIDS  because both  have similar  symptoms  oh my goodness  oh shit  what like  some kind of  sarcoma looking  Henry  we finally  proved you're  gay  you have lupus  and you're  a black  woman  because black  women are  eight times  more likely  to have  lupus  than any  other  what is  that true  yeah what  is the  lupus  well the  lupus is an  autoimmune  disorder  where your  own immune 
[02:25:30]  system attacks  your own  body  your own  joints  liver  heart  lungs  and so  forth  my god  man  so yeah  it was  pretty scary  stupid body  shouldn't you  be able to  just think  like your  brain should  be able to  go I'm  going to  think  and tell  myself to  knock this  shit off  yeah I'm  the smartest  thing in  this damn  body  stop fucking  thinking you  know your  brain should  be able to  go  what's the  difference between  that and  age then  well age is  when we have 
[02:26:00]  an external  virus that  comes in  starts replicating  itself and  destroying the  body as well  so when I was  diagnosed with a  long time ago  they really didn't  know much  the difference  between the two  did you totally  shit your pants  yeah I was  scared to death  I was on an  AIDS ward  it was terrible  so lupus  does lupus  have the same  kill rate as  AIDS  no because  they're treatments  I mean they  can put you on  cortisones or  cortisteroids and  it really minimizes 
[02:26:30]  it right away  but for women  and particularly  black women  it's very difficult  to treat  sometimes they  have to do  chemotherapy  why is it  difficult to  treat in a  black woman  what's the  difference in  physiology  they have it  so much  their immune  system is so  out of control  that it just  it's literally  killing them  and so as I  said they have  to sometimes  use chemotherapy  to actually just  destroy the  immune system  damn  it's amazing  to destroy the  immune system  you're making  everyone sad 
[02:27:00]  and then you  take a bunch  of drugs  to keep  well  I don't know  alright Henry  so wait a minute  I gotta ask you  one more thing  you just  you fucking  love the cock  right  well yeah  who doesn't  do you enjoy  more being the  one who's fed  by the penis  or do you  prefer feeding  someone  oh I'm the  top  oh are you  oh yeah  well  not bragging  no I prefer to  feed I don't  prefer to be fed  though  do you prefer  twinks  no I like 
[02:27:30]  all ages  ok  you like big  bears  that have a lot  of Mondays  available  yes  available on  Mondays  let's go on  Craigslist  men for men  and see if we  have husky  fellow  Mondays  available  no I don't  supposed to be  at work  no  alright  thank you sir  alright you  little twinkie  take it easy  he said that  he's not a twinkie  thank you Henry  seeking friends  from Mondays  there's a party  in my mouth  wanna come  oh boy 
[02:28:00]  another show  got fired  who  radio show  host Todd  and Don  in Austin  Texas  Todd and Don  show  what did we do  what the fuck  did we say  fired for using  word wetbacks  on the air  oh my god  where are they  from  Austin  Texas  yeah Texas  a little  sensitive  fired for saying  well  if we could get  that story  that would be  great  Todd and Don  I don't want to  issue an apology  to all of the  Mexican Americans  thank you Paul W 
[02:28:30]  in Austin Texas  we should have  said that  what are they  saying today  what are they  they got a  twitter page  oh shit  oh shit y'all  the Todd and Don  show  Todd and Don  information  oh in  590 AM  that's what their  little slug line  is for their show  590 AM  is that one of  Mancow Station  when is he on that  Station 2 AM  to 315 AM  KLBJ  cancels  the Todd and Don  show  that really  annoys me 
[02:29:00]  KLBJ  derogatory  comments made  by host  Don Pryor  on the air  last Tuesday  KLBJ  590 AM  has cancelled  the Todd and Don  show  effective  immediately  the station  made an  announcement  at a news  conference  on Monday  afternoon  Todd  Jeffries  and Don  Pryor  are currently  undergoing  a 2 week  unpaid  suspension  over the  incident  I see  this is a  gag  it's the same  gag  textbook  you're going  to be 
[02:29:30]  suspended  for 2 weeks  and then  they sat  there  thinking  oh we're  going to  be fired  I think  we're okay  we're going  to be fired  I think  we're okay  and then  fired  oh I hate  that  you poor  bastards  fucking  textbook  and the  only reason  they do  that is  they try  to see  who else  they have  to fire  KLBJ  officials  said  Jeffries  will return  as news  director  and be  back on  the air  once the  suspension  over  Pryor  however  will be  reassigned  to off  air  duties  so the  show  itself  was  cancelled 
[02:30:00]  but they're  still  kind of  working  for the  company  what's that  about  you think  I don't know  they probably  have a contract  that they'd have to pay them  to do nothing  and just sit  so they said  fuck it  let's just make them  work  because they didn't  do anything wrong  of course they didn't  during last Tuesday's  one hour show  one hour show  holy shit  fuck is that  how do you get that deal  how do you get fired  for a one hour show  we've already done  three shows this week  yeah  holy christ  can you imagine  that's right  Pryor repeatedly  used a disparaging term  to refer to  undocumented workers 
[02:30:30]  living in this country  immigrants  not undocumented workers  undocumented workers  illegal immigrants  fucking christ  undocumented workers  illegal immigrants  are people who are here  illegally and they  immigrate from other countries  you could be  an undocumented worker  who was born and raised here  let's just say  you never fucking  you never filed for  working papers  whatever the fuck  you do  you never got social security  fucking politically correct  idiots  disparaging remarks  undocumented  blah blah blah  after public backlash  that included statements  from the Austin 
[02:31:00]  Hispanic Chamber of Commerce  how come they can mention  the fact  why are they mentioning  their ethnicity  in that chamber of commerce  title  but yet when it comes to this  you have to say  undocumented workers  like it's this fucking machine  there's no ethnicity  or humanity connected to it  fucking phony society  we are man  Americans are pussies  we're not advanced  we're not these fucking  intellectually and culturally advanced  we are a bunch of fucking  pussy whipped  teenage girls  who like to be offended  it's embarrassing 
[02:31:30]  remember Mike Martinez  Pryor and Jeffries  both apologized  for the incident  oh they apologized to  I guess that guy  they suspended the show  on Wednesday  and a statement  station officials  said canceling  the show was  quote  the right thing to do  for our employees  our station  our company  MS Austin Radio  and for the community  oh shut the fuck up  yeah fuck you  right  in other radio news  they're coming in hot and heavy  now  Mike and Eugene writes 
[02:32:00]  you guys should really check out  Man Cow and Penn and Teller's  bullshit  ah fuck  damn update  hold on a minute  he refuses to say  cunt  because his wifey  wouldn't like it  please give me that clip  and then this for Dan  can we get their apology too  I'd love to hear the  Todd and Don apology  Eric's working on it right now  is he  or was it written  where'd you find Eric  whether it's written or not  I'd love to hear it  at the soda machine  he's working on it  so you guys just leave  post-it notes at the soda machine  for a year  oh shit 
[02:32:30]  that's funny  and then  I think it's Jan in Vancouver  writes a Toronto radio DJ  killed himself  after being fired  left the note on Facebook  and I think we have the link  on his feedback  damn yo  when did he do this  I don't know  we'll find out more  if this is legit  wow he couldn't take it huh  there's a lot of pressure though  when they suspend you  and then you're fucking like  in limbo  and you're wondering  that'll drive you a little nutty  that's good terrestrial radio  you get rid of another guy 
[02:33:00]  calling somebody wetbacks  that's good  it was a politically incorrect term  yeah that's good  so Brian Kilmeade  then  we're going back on road here  he had to apologize for that  what  what was he saying  keep marrying other species  comment that  if you remember  we did about 15 minutes  do we have an apology  yeah here's the second half  of that story  18 minutes before the top of the hour  on July 8th  Steve you were off  while we were discussing  a study on marriage and Alzheimer's  that was conducted in Sweden  and Finland  I made comments  that were offensive to many people 
[02:33:30]  that was not my intention  and looking back at those comments  I realized they were inappropriate  for that I sincerely apologize  America  huge melting pot  and that is what makes us  such a great country  shut up  shut you fucking fake  phony reading that mouth  that is a  written  apology  you could hear him reading it  country of  just  pussies  ouch  just  hypersensitive  fucking  victims  what was so bad 
[02:34:00]  what did he do  that was so bad  that warranted  that fucking  groveling  apology  I don't think he was  bad mouthing anybody  no  Jesus Christ  we are just an  antiseptic  dishonest country  everyone's  offended  he has to come in  with his free sodas  he loves  he actually comes here  on weekends  and they have a  they go in the snack room  and have some pretzels  and soda pop  lounges around  what do you bring in  Iraq  the Todd and Don audio 
[02:34:30]  alright  that a boy  Todd and Don  do they have  phony radio voices  no  they sound like news guys  they sound like news guys  it's an hour long show  how many free sodas today  Iraq  this is number one  a lot more to come  no doubt  he don't give a shit  hi Woody  no doubt  here's the audio  what happened to the  good old word  wetback  seriously  what happened  what was wrong  with that 
[02:35:00]  it was  memorable  number one  inappropriate  was it  yeah  here's how  Wikipedia  defines it  a little research  go ahead  wetback is a  derogatory term  for an illegal alien  of hispanic descent  commonly referred to  illegal alien mexicans  although applicable  to all latinos  which have crossed  the border illegally  the term originated  with those who  entered  texas from mexico  by crossing the rio grande  presumably by swimming 
[02:35:30]  or wading across  and getting his  or her  back  wet  in the process  it is what it is  it's memorable  it was compact  it was  it was economical  easy to say  it was offensive  so they're going to  make it very difficult  here  but we can't say  illegal alien anymore  it's getting too hard  it's getting too hard  according to numbers  USA  they got fired  for that  are you kidding me  that is what 
[02:36:00]  they got fired for  they got fired for that  he read the  Wikipedia definition  of wetback  and then pretty much  said  it's easy to remember  the other guy  kept saying  it's derogatory  regular radio  deserves everything  that's coming  their way  they fucking suck  man  if that's all  he wasn't even  using it  no no  and the other guy  was basically  you know  aware that this  could be a problem  and kind of  kept saying  it's derogatory  it's offensive  it's this  oh my god  fucking pussies  Todd and Don  or whatever their  names are  they got railroaded 
[02:36:30]  I'd love to see  what the management  at that fucking  station is  holy shit  and the community  the community  I'll put your community  he was pretty much  saying with political  correctness  what are we doing  undocumented workers  as a term  stinks  it's dishonestly  antiseptic  you have a shocking  radio  reading out of  Wikipedia  that's crazy  that's unbelievable  let's find out more  on the Toronto DJ  doing a little  radio thing here  Dan in Toronto

[02:53:30]  pretty amazing but  i'm telling you  they're using special  lego no i'm not  buying i have you  played lego's in the  last fucking whatever  years no but when  i was all square  shit how are you  making rounded when  i was at disney uh  they have a whole lego  thing and they're  giant and they're  like made out of  just the square ones  it's like any other  no it's like anything  digital no it's it's  like it's like um  pixels okay out of  pixels you can make  anything and it's the  same thing with uh  lego's it's like  you're using little  pixels impossible yeah 
[02:54:00]  it doesn't match up  no swear nope swear  to god do you know  what my nickname from  one fucking group of  girls was it was so  annoying what i'll go  down and they'd go oh  look flu shit breath is  here  how endearing i hated  that nickname like what  do you mean by that  all right we're gonna  break with the bobo  fucking boner backstage  piece and then uh we're  gonna have some good  stuff after the break  uh i'm looking at the 
[02:54:30]  instant feedback someone  actually wrote that  illegal alien song  sounded a lot like  phil collins  wow i thought so too  yeah it did  that person does know  that phil collins was  the lead singer of  genesis right  there's no clue  real all right and  anthony i got this for  you uh trucker t writes  opi is right i haul 
[02:55:00]  legos and they make  lego sets for different  things well no i know  they do that so what are  you saying they make  like sets for different  things they can you know  you can build a building  right that's a certain  building i think they  misrepresent for all these  years where they say here  get a box of legos and  you can make a human being  like in no fucking way  those are regular square  legos right those are  your regular square legos  but they do make sets  where you can make like  you know like uh uh  carousel and things like  that and those those as 
[02:55:30]  well those are separate  little like i'm saying  they just take that and  they go on a bigger scale  you know you know i think  so those are square  goddamn legos you know  what those are all square  legos it's like a digital  a three-dimensional digital  picture i'm not ready to  let this one go i'm not  ready to let this one go  see you're adamant what  about the guy we saw a  lego person where he's  ripping his own chest open  that was pretty cool that  you're saying you can make  that with just a bunch of  regular i can make it it  would look like shit  every everything i build in  legos looks like a wall 
[02:56:00]  i have no depth perception  with legos because you but  like that's great that's all  square you're trying to tell  me you can make that out of  just no yeah that's all just  how do we how do we solve  this well how would you get  the arms to stay out that far  you probably you probably  credit and then they come  back and i love legos it's  just uh it's it's the way  they it's almost like you  took a digital old print out  of something and just made it  three-dimensional i understand  but how are you there how are 
[02:56:30]  you gonna get them to  interlock they're legos  there no no no no i understand  that but but you need them to  interlock you need to interlock in  in in different ways to get those  shapes not really seen a regular  lego lego i don't know it's just  straight up and down those are  square digital i don't want to let  this one go that's pretty cool man  that's a fucking amazing that is a  good one the guy it's a guy  ripping his chest open and loose  legos it pouring out of the open  chest and he's kind of looking up 
[02:57:00]  he looks almost pained that is  really cool though i hope you're  working out wrong but i don't i  have to throw out a quick  apology i don't really see it  happening i mean you discuss the  whole thing for everybody and  this whole fuck around betting  thing thing is a little rough  jimmy well i have to throw out a  quick apology to the end yeah i  have he and i were discussing  something i have not gotten back  to him it's because i've been  working on something else so i  only think i forgot about you i  did not um but you did and uh no  i i like c to the l and and  can i'll let me let me tell you  why i said fuck around betting  i want the audience to know 
[02:57:30]  uh ron as we know does  interviews the ron betting  interviews and they're very  good he's a good interviewer  they're very good yes and so i  see ron betting is interviewing  marianne faithful uh recently  you're not a fan of hers are you  well i wasn't oh and now i'm  obsessed because of fucking ron  betting phenomenal interview i had  no interest in this old lady you  totally turn it turn this around  why because you said fuck ron  bennington and i thought he did  something bad but you're saying 
[02:58:00]  because he's so good at his craft  that you you are jealous and saying  fuck ron betting no i'm annoyed  because i'm on itunes like a  fucking homo looking for marianne  faithful songs and downloading it  what was the one he played which  one did you uh the one that the  jagger and and fucking uh and  richard wrote uh tears go by her  version of that in 64 how do you not  like it well we gotta listen to it  now jimmy and then there's a version  on youtube where jean-luc godard the  french director uh did a film in 
[02:58:30]  1966 called i think made in the usa and  there's a weird fucking artsy scene of  her sitting in a diner singing it a capella while characters in this french  film look at each other it's really  weird but it's fucking kind of eerie if  you find the youtuber it's fucking  great i think she was a she's  beautiful she was a one-song hack  though no no no she was not at all  she did a lot of big hits what is she  known for um fucking mick jagger i think  yeah that's pretty much it for real i'm 
[02:59:00]  not even trying to make it was that one  right there i know her for having sex  with mick jagger i think they had sex  yeah she was cute man  smiling faces i can see  but not shove a cock in her mouth shut her  up she can see her  i sit and watch as tears go by  my riches can't buy  you don't like it  hope he's making a face 
[02:59:30]  i don't like the fucking french douches  i wasn't sitting around the table  like that  uh-huh-huh  the children say  her voice sounds great  when the truth is gone  to be like  no  that's so funny  i sit and watch as tears go by  the fuck is this about  i don't know it's just a clip from the movie 
[03:00:00]  what i  it is the evening of the day  i sit and watch the children play  all right  hope that solved something  we didn't have to listen to the whole thing  i was just saying  i don't like the fact  no jimmy  now we're listening to it  that's not bad actually  no  i sit and watch as tears go by 
[03:00:30]  i feel like you should just shut up  i feel like you should just shut up  and then the surrender people start talking  the stones did a version of that  that's not that doesn't sound like the version  that became a hit obviously  the stones did a version of that  did you actually just say that  did you actually just say the stones  did a version of that  well they wrote it was written by jagger  it was the first song that jagger  and and richard wrote to each other  that is such a popular rolling stones song  her version is a bigger song than this 
[03:01:00]  no  no  um  it was done  this song was huge jimmy  this is  i'm sure it was  but it was  early stones  they wrote it  yeah  this is a huge song for the stones  this is giant for the stones  i think i've read that hers was more popular  that was a massive fucking hit from mary  with mick  i said her mouth was around his dick  but hers came out a year earlier  even though they wrote it  hers came out in 64  i  this was  i always heard it the other way  that this  this was a massive song for the world  it probably was 
[03:01:30]  massive  it's phenomenal  this is a biggie  yeah this is a good one  i watch these guys  i watch them sing this on the ed sullivan show  watch the clip  it's just mick just sitting there  and richard's just strumming  and you're like  god  mick is a bad mouth  i think i have like  an orchestra  in the background  it was just those two  yeah  and mick is just sitting there  with his legs crossed  and you're like  you bad  big lip motherfucker  mick jagger's a bad dude  nothing better than early stones  i'll tell you right now  fucking 
[03:02:00]  i really do like early stones  early stones  not too early  that's one of those  i'm talking like the 70s  like the early 70s  the mid 70s  and and  holy  a few songs though  you can just throw right the fuck out  i don't like them but  well that  that got into the late 70s  yeah  they sort of  sort of did that like  emotional rescue  and all that right  but fucking bennington  sent me down this road  yesterday  this is what i was doing  because this interview was so good  and then he played her version of  tears go by  and i'm like  i had to go get it  and then i get it 
[03:02:30]  and i realized she did a cover  of working class hero  which she sounds like a smoker now  but her voice is still kind of cool  yeah  and i went and bought her greatest hits  and now i'm looking for fucking  working class hero covers  and now i'm fucking looking  god damn it  am i easily influenced  you really are  but ron made it  so interesting  i mean it was a compelling interview  i was gonna listen to it for 30 seconds  because i met her very very briefly  when i met metallica  because she was in a metallica song  um  she was in a metallica song  yeah  la da da da da  memory remains  memory remains  she was in that 
[03:03:00]  she's the one that  did i know that  she wrecked the song  no she was great in that  she was chilling  she was in the video as well  she was great dude  i don't care about being chilling  i want to get the song  was i supposed to know that  and i forgot that knowledge  you'll know it  no i know the song  and all that  i didn't realize it was her  i thought it was well known  but i'm you know  i'm a big fan  so i just assumed  i saw the rehearsals  brewer brought me  this is 97 i believe  and the metallica was rehearsing  that and fuel  and marianne faithful came in  and uh james was  i think she was late  and hetfield was annoyed 
[03:03:30]  sorry that was me  that's uh  you never have to be worried  uh uh  sorry about that my friend  yeah that's a little metallica  yeah let's see her part  i loved her part in this  aunt didn't like it  that's her  that's very good  i don't think i knew that  i don't need this in that song  by the way this video was so fucking cool  the metallica swinging around  in the room video  yeah it was like dancing on the ceiling 
[03:04:00]  yeah yeah  only cool  yeah it's just weird  i heard a voice in my right ear  left ear  my rear  what  is that travis in one of our ears  yeah it's her  no that's travis  he's saying something  travis is whispering  that's what i meant  she's saying something travis  and she uh  she did a great cover of working class hero  all i wanted to do  is hear fucking covers of that song yesterday  really  that's all i wanted to do  you are obsessive 
[03:04:30]  i really am  yeah  but that's brawny sent me down this road  she did  she did sister morphine too  yes that's her  matt moore from dallas  thank you for that  i did not  her original version of fucking tears go by  stone's version is great obviously  that was a huge shit  but her uh  her version was  she used to  and again this i learned this from ron's interview  she was  um  brian epstein  there's this clip i saw on youtube of brian epstein introducing her  like she used to have with the beatles  she's fucking 
[03:05:00]  she's great man  she obviously gave good head  she must have been a good fuck  dirty teen idol  this is her original version  i've never heard this before in my life  for real  massive hit  i i know that i've never heard this  oh the stones pumped this song up nice for her  yeah  right  she's singing it too fast  oh wait it's her song  no they wrote it though  it's very folky  very  like those old hippie fucking  yeah  tate ashbury fucking 
[03:05:30]  hippie  cunts  she's got a great voice  phenomenal  64 this is  folk singer  she's a folk singer  and then i think she said  she like  when mick and keith saw what a massive hit it was  they probably just like did it  it was their song  wait now i'm so confused now  mick and keith  it was the first song they ever wrote together  they wrote it but they didn't perform it originally  oh she did it a year earlier  why  i think they wrote it either for her or they wrote it and gave it to her  oh come on  it's true 
[03:06:00]  wait they wrote the song but she performed it  yes  even though they were already the stones  a band  i don't know if they were using the stones yet  it was mick and keith wrote it  and she recorded it in 64  her version is from 1964  why would she record it before they did  i think they didn't want  because they weren't stupid  this is obviously a smash  i don't know  i'm quoting from 10 minutes i heard of ron's interview  i know none of this  this is all betting  what do you want from me  we all do that though  but i don't know  we just recite shit we hear  but i know that  she was a good interview man  she was just  that's cool 
[03:06:30]  you know she's like  ronnie did that to me with  ronnie did that to me with  uh warren zivon  some broad he was married to  from i don't know  maybe six months  i'm like i ain't listening to this  and next thing you know  the hour went by  and i i was like  just so into this warren zivon  it's amazing  they've had bookings on there  on well we've had bookings  uh people approach us with bookings  and said no  and like what are you insane  why would we want that person  and then they give them to ron and fez  and ronnie talks to me like  holy shit 
[03:07:00]  how the fuck does he do that  that's why i want to take some of these  because fucking ron is  it's all  but we have to take ron also  unlike you  and bring him in  to interview the person  because we think  no we don't need to do that  because we all know  what seat ron will be taking  we don't need to do that  we uh no  we do pretty good interviews ourselves  absolutely  oh i know we rule  i think he does good research  yeah now ronnie knows how to  it's great  uh thank you matt lafar  we backed this up jimmy  i said it was a bigger hit  for the stones  well as tears go by 
[03:07:30]  i reached number 22  on the billboard for uh  for uh your broad  area  okay  very unfaithful  and number six for the stones  okay  i just read that  i read somewhere  that it was just  it was a more popular version  by her  i just made that out  did you  no  i'm not gonna surprise me  i'm just kidding  hunched over retard  and a cocksucker  i'm just kidding  fucking doyle hargrave  because he said  hunched over retard  and cocksucker  like  no  what kind of joke is that  there's no  there's no  that's not funny

[03:12:30]  hour  you've heard it by now  right  yeah  it's fucking great  didn't they have to  train him to talk or  something  i think that's what the  boys at xm said  but it is a great show  it's one lousy hour  and he makes it really  interesting  you listen to songs  you would never  listen to  i couldn't imagine  he would communicate  like that  and then you're like  alright now i gotta  hear this song 
[03:13:00]  and you understand  the story  jimmy you might like it  the interesting part is  it's called the bob dylan  channel even though  he's not on it  constantly  yeah  why this should be  called the opium anthony  channel  it's a theme time  radio app  same  you do that very well  oh thank you  very well  i try  he did a whole  fucking show on like  summer songs or  something  did he  and that's been  like a theme that  he does  yeah but that's been  done a million times  but he did it like  the properly  like he made it  really really good  fucking guy  what else did he do  i think he did a  whole baseball hour  once  really 
[03:13:30]  yeah yeah  i'm telling you  i don't know when  it's on  all of a sudden  i'm just flipping around  and there he is  maybe i should  you know have a  proper plug  but it's so worth  checking out  so worth it  i think that was  uh lee abrams baby  wasn't it  the the xm guru  oh right  yeah yeah  and i think lee  had to like sit him  down and teach him  how to talk  for the radio  that's that's how  the story goes  that we heard  ah lee  good old lee  remember him  what's he doing  when did we lose him  what what year  did we lose him 
[03:14:00]  uh he was gone  probably  ought what  ought  ought  ought six  ought six  ought seven  ought seven  ought seven i'm saying  but he was one of the smart ones  he saw that the disease was coming  and he said you know what  i'm moving somewhere  where the disease isn't going to touch me  he was able to take a plane  and fly on out of here  fly over the zombies  i miss making fun of him  and his  and his  fucking  pot habit  pot addiction  he's over in the middle east  flying lessons  right  fucking creep  that fucking guy

[03:20:00]  you go to some dive  what  what the fuck is it  the shitty bars in the sky  look at more things  we don't know  that we're just asking  questions  oh we need the apology  story  everyone's getting mad  yes they're getting  very angry  so don and todd  said wetbacks  or something  yep  it was nothing  they read a definition  from wikipedia  uh i guess they  got reassigned  their show got cancelled  and they really want  to be doing their show  and they got reassigned  which is basically  a firing  it's probably some kind  of technicality  yeah  uh but before they got fired  they really tried to  explain their way out of it  ladies and gentlemen 
[03:20:30]  if we could  we want to begin this  they've got to do  with their apologies  and their fake voices  too  yeah  yeah  ladies and gentlemen  let me tell you  ladies and gentlemen  if we could  we want to begin  this show  with a very sincere  apology  about some comments  that were made yesterday  yes  during this hour  about this time  right  uh we do deeply  regret  and apologize  people were offended  by the way  they don't  they're not  sorry  they don't care  every apology  the guy  the guy was impassioned 
[03:21:00]  when he was talking  about  the use of the word  uh wetback  oh yeah  it's definition  um he  you can't take that  kind of passion  and then turn it  into an apology  but what he was doing  was basically  talking about  political correctness  saying why is this  word not used  at least what we heard  it wasn't like he was  talking about  a Sotomayor  or saying something  racist about somebody  or nasty  he reads the definition  he says  I don't know why  this word is not used  it was simple  and uh  then the next day  he gives an apology  and these scumbags 
[03:21:30]  still cancel the show  yeah  yeah  what did the  fucking special interest group  still push  it wasn't good enough  for the fucking special interest group  oh fuck the whole country  I know  I feel the same way  how would you fuck the country  one big giant  politically correct dick  you certainly wouldn't  hold on to Florida  because then  it would look like  you're holding on to a penis  here's what you do  you'd fucking kneel in Canada  because that's where  this fucking racial hypersensitivity  has bled down through  you'd put one palm on LA  one palm on New York  and just stick your big fat  fucking dick  into the middle of the country 
[03:22:00]  and pump it  until it's fucking  honesty and humor leaked out  what part of the country would you fuck  the Great Lakes  that area looks like  soft and nice  you'd dip and dab your dick  you'd dip it in one of the lakes  and then you'd slap the pre-cum  all over fucking North Dakota  you'd rub it through Wyoming  and shoot your jizz  on Pennsylvania  Maine and Vermont  what about some deep dicking  in uh  the Grand Canyon  you would probably  yeah  this fucking monster  has a black wig on  I am sick  of looking at  Wendy fucking Williams  every day she changes her look  she's meatloaf  it's like  it's like the record skips 
[03:22:30]  with our show  Jimmy's in the middle  of a conversation  and we just go whammo  into something else  people are probably thinking  what do they do  no wonder feedback  comes in all the time  it's like  yo the feed just screwed up  it's popping all over the place  no  we just changed something  with a monster  in a red dress  and a black wig  just walked out  dark black wig on  on C-SPAN  she's got some massive  oh no Jimmy  she's got some massive  fucking breasts  giant fucking  you think they look good  if you take the dress off  no  those things sag 
[03:23:00]  I bet you  I don't know  Wendy Williams is a monster  Jimmy you like her look today  she's a huge woman  she's bigger than I like  but I'd definitely fuck Wendy Williams  I'm telling you  absolutely  she has just a  big juicy body  would you lick her ass  why not  yeah she's probably clean  oh my god  stop it  Jimmy  stop it all  for all that is holy  she's too conscientious  of how she looks  in her appearance  I guarantee you  that if she would  probably fucking  she'd shower first  and then put her  dump her right in your face  and teach her lesson  it's gotta look like 
[03:23:30]  I think her ass  has skin tags  looks exactly like  under that wig  would look  just some tufts  some tufts  of really  clipped hair  fuck that  who's that  oh you're looking  for someone else  I'm seeing nudity  apparently there's  a shemale star  called Wendy Williams  I'm seeing nudity  it doesn't matter  what Danny's looking up  it could be something  from Disney 
[03:24:00]  there will be nudity  in it  they're calling it  random topic Tuesday  on the O.P. Anthony show  maybe we could get  the Bob Dylan  I want to hear one break  from his radio hour  did we finish the  apology  alright let's do this  alright let's try to get  somebody  Christ  regret  and apologize  people were offended  and we regret it  absolutely  we understand  the weight of the words  that were used  during this hour  yesterday  on the Todd and Don show  and from the bottom  of my heart  I do regret it  and please  we ask for your forgiveness 
[03:24:30]  we are very sorry  I frequently use sarcasm  and satire in my humor  and the first mistake  I made was using  the term in the first place  if you heard the show  you know what I'm talking about  it's a highly offensive  and a dated term  that should never be used  under any circumstances  and the second mistake  I made  was assuming  that the audience  knew that I was being sarcastic  when I used the term  it was a serious error  in judgment  I can promise you  it'll never happen again  and I want to sincerely  apologize to all  of our listening audience  why is that enough 
[03:25:00]  we should also note  that the things  that were said yesterday  during our show  are not reflective  of management  or ownership  of the station  or sponsors  of the station  we are sorry  but we do want to  move on from this  thank you very much  alright  well move on  alright  right off your  fucking show  you move on  regular radio  deserves everything  that's coming its way  protect management  and your  say  let your management  it's okay  they wrote that statement  and said look  and you're going to say  that we had nothing  to do with this  they made them read that  before they  took their show away 
[03:25:30]  obviously  they  you know  hey go in there  here's an apology  alright look  we're going to have to  suspend you  and then okay  your show's over  that's how they work  that's why  the apologies  they're never sincere  and they want to make  everyone perfectly clear  the company had nothing  to do with that  so they can move on  without these guys  without any other problems  all they have to do  is fight back  against these special  interest groups  and they would go away  you get  the fucking radio  gave these guys  so much god damn  power that they  don't deserve  it's a bunch of  it's unbelievable 
[03:26:00]  it's a bunch of  fucking incompetence  running radio  can one of the guys  and I never  usually come up  with things  work for the guys  I don't like doing that  I like drinking with them  and being their pal  hey  one of you  fuck dicks  I'd love  to get a montage  of all of these  fucking apologies  strung together  so we can hear  how exactly  the same they sound  because it's 
[03:26:30]  exactly the same  apology  and mix and match  you know what I mean  like jump around  I think that's a job  for E-Rock  I think just  someone put a post-it  on the soda machine  for E-Rock  I'd like to apologize  I want to apologize  I want to apologize  insincere  insincere  horrible horrible  horrible  remarks  remarks  regrets  regret  regret  I deeply regret  we deeply regret  did we put a couple  of bars in there  oh fuck yeah  we were phony pieces  of shit  yeah but  we're the first ones  to admit that  when you hear  a radio guy  apologizing  it's a fake apology 
[03:27:00]  and the radio guys  don't mean it  whatsoever  we've never  been sincere  about an apology  ever  there's not another  radio guy  that has admitted  that ever  oh  before  they write  the statement  for you  they say  you are going  to read this  under the guise  that you're  keeping your job  right  and then you're  like fuck  I don't have  a choice  because you know  in the end  you want to  talk to your  radio audience  yeah  and you do it  and then you get  and then you get  you know  you crumple up  the paper  and throw it  so hopefully  the audience  hears that 
[03:27:30]  you try to  like give signals  out there  like you're  a hostage  yeah you're  crossing your  fingers  no for real  though  you kind of  like try to  get something  out there  that Michael  passed management's  dopey heads  and get the word  to your listeners  that you know  that we have to do this  that they're torturing you  just like this  you look  I'm very sorry  I'm not  and what I want  to say  is that  I really think  they're making  me that  and you might

[03:32:30]  Esther Texaco  and flesh blood  and bones  she wants a guy  two arms  two legs  and two lips  to call her own  if she had  six fingers  and three nipples  she'd be more  like Anne Boleyn  the wife whom  King Henry VIII  was trying to unload  he had a plan  if he couldn't  get his divorce decree  he was going to  claim that the  extra digit  and the supernumerary  nipple  was evidence  that she was a witch  a little too much  flesh blood  and bones  on Anne Boleyn  could have proven 
[03:33:00]  her a downfall  holy mother of god  I understood  everything he said  and what he was  talking about  I did too  but why would  you bring that up  Anne Boleyn  who doesn't talk  about her  and her six fingers  and nipples  not Anne Boleyn  Anne Boleyn  is a big blood  from the stone  but it can die blood  even if it's blue blood  this show is for everybody  including the bleeding hearts  John D.

[03:35:30]  until 10 o'clock  why not  bring some soup in  that shit smells good  exactly  Jermaine said  in an interview  that he wished  that he'd been  the one to die  and not Michael  oh shut up  as a father  how do you react  what  as a father  who would you like  to see dance  right  is he actually  gone there  everyone says  that shit  you don't really mean it  why couldn't it be me  I'm glad it wasn't me  yeah no kidding  we're in Caligula  I offer my life  to Jupiter  so that  so that  the emperor  and then Caligula  pipes up  Jupiter accepts 
[03:36:00]  Jupiter accepts  whammo  and you can't say  how do you know  you can't talk to Jupiter  Jupiter accepts  why is he going for  he wants an explanation  for a nonsense statement  yeah  and what's he supposed  to say now  I want to die  and not Michael  as a father  how do you react to that  well I can't  that's Jermaine talking  you know  thank you  how do you feel  when you hear it  well  that's what Jermaine thought  and maybe that's what 
[03:36:30]  his reaction was  but he's living  and Michael is dead  and so  and so  that's the way it is  it's not him  isn't it hard  isn't it hard to accept  except what Larry  oh my god  that your son is gone  of course  thank you Joe Jackson  you're making us like  Joe Jackson  you idiot  Larry King  is the worst interviewer  on TV right now  he just asked  a dead kid's father  is it hard 
[03:37:00]  to deal with  or whatever  it's hard to accept  your kid being dead  and he's like  what  like it's such a ridiculous  question  you have to ask what  your son being dead  no it's pretty easy  as a matter of fact  we really don't care  don't give a shit  at all there Larry  what's with Larry's face  Joe  something's happening  it's like  do you ever see  the invasion  of the body snatchers  with Donald Sutherland  that one  you ever see  right before  they start changing  their face starts  twitching  and caves in 
[03:37:30]  on itself  that's happening  to the right side  of Larry's face  if you're looking  at the screen  well  let me see  what's going on  with Larry  he doesn't look  broken up to me  the dad  he certainly  doesn't look  broken up  he doesn't  yeah well  but Larry  he's probably not  but Larry  asking is just  as  yeah  Larry asking  is ridiculous  completely  you give a shit  about your son  how important  is a heartbeat  in your kid  Larry looks like  Woody Allen  in 1965 now 
[03:38:00]  fucking creepy  narrow head he has  it's a fucking  tack head  a tack  yeah look at him  what a fucking  awful tweety head  on little slit eyes  he can't keep  the one eye open  he's starting to look  like a martian  yeah  what's he talking  about with Joe  alright we'll find  out more  here we go  Joe talks about  putting the grandchildren  into showbiz  down the road  if they expressed  an interest  I mean you  raised a family  they all got  into showbiz  if the grandchildren  wanted to  would you encourage  Larry I know 
[03:38:30]  where you're  trying to go  with that  and I don't  I'm going to try  to go anywhere  I'm asking you  would you encourage  them  no I'm not  I'm not  I'm not encouraging  them to do  nothing  not  they have to be  what they are  kids at the moment  yes  and be raised  properly  so those rumors  that you wanted  to tour the Jackson  3  not true  that's a bunch  of jive  that's a bunch  I wish I could say  what I should say  that's a bunch  of  and you know  why as a sucky  interviewer  and you know  why the rumors  were so strong  right  why  because of CNN 
[03:39:00]  hmm  they did more  covers than anybody  on this  yeah  well they go  they go off  on a rumor  like that  and then treat  it like news  right  I mean we did  but who cares  COPN  I think we kind  of said  we try to  keep it  we blew that up  we're like  there's no fucking  way  we broke  that that was  fake  right  I think we did  who's listening  I don't know  but  we're the best  and the little  girl crying  with them all  on mic  and everything  stop it  I didn't believe  that  it was really  sad to see  Van Damme's 
[03:39:30]  children upset  this next clip  could be good  because it says  Joe talks about  foul play  with the Michael  Jackson death  and confuses  Larry  oh no  oh boy  chicken was involved  do you frankly  think that drugs  were involved  in your son's life  something happened  there Larry  there wasn't  just only drugs  there was just  something else  behind all of that  and what do you mean  what do you  what are you  what are you  thinking  something about 
[03:40:00]  a dress  I'm thinking  that's foul play  yeah that's  what I'm thinking  explain that  foul play  meaning what  somebody trying  to harm him  of course  no  you get into  that role  Larry  Larry  you get into  I don't know  what you said  I'm sorry  I didn't hear  what you said  I told him  to get into  that girl  he knows  all that stuff  about the  you know  what happens  that was the  worst moment  on television 
[03:40:30]  in 30 years  wow  horrendous  how  are the CNN  execs watching  this show  it's  do they know  that they still  are paying  this guy  he gets  nothing  out of  people  are they  scared  to fire  him  what's  the problem  and I think  he just re-upped  for another year  or two  he gets  nothing  out of his  guests  he's a bore  he has  questions that  don't have  any answers  yeah they can't  possibly answer  those  I think  foul play  was involved  do you mean  like harm 
[03:41:00]  no what else  could foul play  mean  you idiot  what does foul play  always mean  problem  someone harming  somebody else  do you mean  suspicion of it  do you mean  he had two  strikes  and he  fouled off  a pitch  and was  still able  to safely  reach first  how important  is a prostate  can I have  Michaels  Thomas  overbeck  from Dallas  Billie Jean  did her lawyers  ever settle  with Michael  right
