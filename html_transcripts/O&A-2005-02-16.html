<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with their signature "All day I dream about sex" bit and a comedic intro showcasing their imagined superpowers.  The show quickly dives into "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," encouraging women to flash drivers displaying WOW stickers.  This is followed by a discussion of a police chase video highlighting the futility of fleeing police helicopters, prompting a tangential discussion of various "Cops" TV show episodes and suspect reactions.

A substantial portion of the broadcast is consumed by persistent technical difficulties with the phone lines.  Opie and Anthony express intense frustration, using explicit language to criticize XM Satellite Radio for what they perceive as insufficient advertising support and poor technical service, referencing a planned national advertising campaign that was ultimately scaled back. A caller suggests hiding in a shopping mall to evade police, which is met with mockery.  Further attempts at phone calls are repeatedly hampered by technical issues.

Regular caller Rich Voss announces his engagement, though the poor connection makes details unclear. The hosts speculate about his relationship and personal life with crude humor.  The technical issues continue, escalating their anger and frustration.  The show continues with more phone calls (many with poor audio), interspersed with music and discussions including the Chris Rock/Oscars controversy, the aesthetic merits of the Central Park gates, listener submissions, and a discussion of a drug-resistant strain of HIV ("Super AIDS") linked to crystal meth use, accompanied by graphic and offensive comments.  Opie recounts making a homemade stun gun and using it on a former girlfriend.

The show then shifts to a focus on the effects of crystal meth on sexual behavior, sparked by a caller, "Sauce," detailing its disinhibiting effects and his attraction to men.  This leads to a discussion on sexuality and whether it's genetic.  Callers contribute anecdotes about meth's impact on sexual function, including claims of erectile dysfunction leading to anal sex and cocaine use for enhanced sexual performance.  A recurring humorous bit about everyone having AIDS punctuates this segment.

The show then returns to Rich Voss's engagement, with Voss detailing his unconventional proposal at a cheap hotel after a diner date. He discusses the ring and his fiancée Bonnie's reaction. Bonnie joins the show, offering her perspective and humorous anecdotes. The conversation involves Voss's children, previous marriage, and wedding planning, including speculation about Jim Norton as best man and Opie and Anthony DJing (which Voss rejects).  The hosts share anecdotes about disastrous weddings, including a guest dying during a ceremony and a best man throwing the ring into a lake.

A significant portion focuses on listener-submitted disastrous wedding stories.  Callers Anthony (an EMS worker), Infected Curtis, and Vinny O’Shea contribute, alongside studio guest Keith Robinson.  A Stephen Lynch song is played.  The conversation shifts to Colin Quinn's success in a celebrity poker game, Anthony's upcoming participation, Bob Kelly's personal life, Rich Voss's engagement (revisited), Jay Moore's raunchy comedy routine, and Keith Robinson's experiences with police accusations of rape.  Mayoral candidate Bernie Getz calls in to discuss his platform and unusual hobbies, including a broken levitating device and his pet squirrel.

A phone interview with Bernie Getz dominates a segment, covering his political platform (Central Park lake cleanup, free school lunches), his relationship with squirrels (including detailed anatomy and affection), and an invitation to his apartment.  Notable moments include his assertion that vegetarian children are less prone to bullying and discussions about squirrel penises.  The hosts discuss helping Getz gather ballot signatures.  The show transitions to discussing the Christo gates in Central Park, O.J. Simpson's brother's involvement in a bus crash (including prank calls to O.J.), and Michael Jackson's trial, including speculation about his defense witnesses. Opie shares a story about an unpleasant experience with pepper spray and a subsequent bowel incident in police custody. Keith Robinson remains in studio throughout much of this segment.

The show concludes with vulgar exclamations from the hosts, followed by a caller, Dan from Minneapolis, experiencing technical difficulties while recounting a car accident.  Another caller, Guinness, reminisces about past stunts, including the "55-gallon drum challenge," detailing its negative consequences.  They discuss transvestite wrestling and other past stunts, with Guinness promoting his upcoming comedy shows.  The show plays clips from an interview with Jose Canseco regarding steroid use in baseball. Jim Norton promotes his stand-up shows, and the broadcast ends with a brief XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites 
[00:04:30]  to fight the forces of evil.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With Opie.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Act, act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards. 
[00:05:00]  Ben looks like curly-spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Whenever Steve yawns, it looks like the back of the Batmobile and it excites.  Pachytosis.  All right, kid, I'm going to cry.  Shut up.  And on with superhuman powers.  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin-trap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place. 
[00:05:30]  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just mixed.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, God. 
[00:06:00]  Ow, ow, ow.  Oh, stop.  Oh, stop.  Oh, I can't breathe.  Stop. 
[00:06:30]  You guys okay?  Okay, dude.  Let's go.  Oh, I can't breathe.  Oh, I can't breathe.  Oh, I can't breathe.  Ow. 
[00:07:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  That worked, huh?  That's a fine how-do-you-do for the day, huh?  Yeah, what a way to start the program.  Damn, people in agony.  On this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Oh, oh.  Yep.  Last Wednesday was a travel day, so we couldn't really promote Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  No.  You can get your WOW stickers by going to opianthony.com.  You throw a WOW sticker on your ride, and if the ladies feel like it, if they're feeling 
[00:07:30]  in the mood, if they're feeling festive, they're going to flash as you're driving around the  highways and the byways.  Sure.  It's like fishing.  You just got to put the bait out there, your WOW sticker, or yeah, the sign or written in  the dirt on the back of a truck, and before you know it, you're just sitting in traffic  maybe, or a car pulls up next to you, you don't expect it, you forgot you even had the  WOW sticker on there, and then a girl is flashing you, and you go, what, why is, oh, oh, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Now I remember.  And a big thank you to the truckers, because they took it upon themselves to start riding  in the dirt on the back of their rigs and stuff.  Right.  That's what that WOW thing means.  It started about eight years ago or so.  I don't know.  Very good.  This police video is amazing.  Oh, yeah.  Chase, in L.A., I guess, some guy's running from the cops on the freeway, and I guess his  buddy is in the back seat and opens the door and tries to jump out when the car's rolling, 
[00:08:30]  and you just see his head smash onto the freeway, falls out on his ass, and just goes backwards  tumbles backwards, and just, bam, hits his head.  His buddy gets out of the car and starts running, and that never works.  Yeah.  He falls down on the side of the road, and the cops just jump on him, and you just see  arms and fists.  It never works, because you can't outrun a helicopter.  No.  That's the best about those chases. 
[00:09:00]  Don't they understand that?  Right.  Like, there's helicopters.  They're tracking you.  They've got heat sensors on there.  They could press a button, and the camera will track them.  You know, they don't even have to do it manually.  It doesn't matter which way the copter's going, everything.  They know exactly where these people are, but they continue to run.  You know what would be a great TV show is the audio from the helicopter pilots.  Just following these guys.  Oh, look at this idiot.  Look at this jackass.  He thinks he's going to outrun me. 
[00:09:30]  He's hiding under the little waiting pool.  Yeah.  The little kiddie pool in the backyard.  One of my favorite cop episodes ever of cops.  They go in the backyard, and I guess the two guys had been doing something bad, and they're  searching the backyard, and the cops notice an overturned little plastic kiddie pool, and  one of the cops kicks it, and the two guys are under there pretty much spooning.  They're together spooning under there, and they don't instantly get up.  They just kind of turn their head like, hey, what?  I love the guys that never want to give up. 
[00:10:00]  They never want to give up.  Wait, no, we were just laying here under the kiddie pool.  Why are you hassling us, man?  That's so true, man.  They catch him dead to rights.  You've got to realize when it's over, Johnny.  You know what I mean?  When it's over, Johnny.  I mean, come on.  Sometimes you get those guys on cops.  They're like, all right, you got me.  Yeah.  I like the guys that run and put the cops through crap, man.  You know, they're hitting them with their car.  You know, just the chase itself is pretty stressful to the cops.  They're putting public in danger. 
[00:10:30]  Then something happens to their car, maybe.  They step out.  They run.  And then when the guy realizes he can't go any further, one guy I saw turned around, kind  of smiled, and put his hands on his head like, all right, you got me, and I gave up.  So now what are you going to do?  They tackled this guy, and just the knee right into the throat.  The nightstick is out.  I mean, they're poking the guy on the side with it.  It doesn't matter.  You can't decide it's over by putting your hands on your head and going, all right, 
[00:11:00]  I give.  It's not a game.  They're still going to tune you up a little bit.  Just a bit.  You got to teach him for next time.  Yeah, show you who's boss.  Right.  Well, the phones have exploded.  We haven't gone on the phones a lot lately, so why don't we start the show?  Isn't there a reason for that?  Some fine, fine phone calls.  Wait, before we go to the phones.  Oh, darn it.  It's not set up right, though.  Oh, oh.  My fault, though.  My fault.  Let's go to the phones, Anthony.  All righty.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[00:11:30]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  We'll start with Steve in New Orleans.  Steve, what's going on, buddy?  It's a...  What?  Oh, Steve.  Vanannular phone.  Yeah, Steve.  Yeah, I'm from Maryland, not from New Orleans.  So who the fuck cares?  Is your name Steve?  Yeah.  Then start the program.  Let's go.  I got a way to get away from the helicopter, man.  You just go into a shopping mall.  They can't find you.  You can break from the cops. 
[00:12:00]  Go into a shopping mall, and then they send cops into the shopping mall.  If it's a crowded mall, they're not going to find you.  Really?  With the description and everything?  That seems like a lame-ass idea.  You cover the doors to the shopping mall so that no one can...  How do they know you're going to the shopping mall, Anthony?  How do they think the helicopter saw you go into the shopping mall?  Okay, they saw you, so the cops follow you.  You're in a crowded mall.  How do they know who's there?  And how are you going to find the nearest shopping mall?  Yeah.  Obviously.  You just have to look at the exit on the freeway. 
[00:12:30]  Your theory stinks, and your city stinks.  You're busted.  Or state of whatever.  Where is he from?  I forgot.  Maryland.  Oh, Maryland.  That is actually the only shot you have, though, is the shopping mall.  He actually makes a point.  The shopping mall.  The only shot you have with a helicopter is to a monstrous mall and just hope you can  run and lose somebody inside, but that's the only shot you have.  Yeah.  It's a long shot.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  By the way, we're not going to complain on the show anymore, obviously, but I just want  to acknowledge that the phones are still messed up.  Yeah, I like that.  Don't want to get anyone pissed off anywhere, but the phones still sound like there's some 
[00:13:00]  kind of underwater thing happening.  What's wrong with the phones?  And I think we mentioned it, oh, just a few times, but don't want to bitch.  Nope.  Nope.  Don't want to get anyone all pissed off because we're trying to, you know, make a better show  here.  Did you see my computer's fixed over here?  Very nice.  Actually, it isn't.  Oh, it's not?  Just figured I'd feel good about saying it like it was.  Well, let's not bitch, though, Anthony.  No, no bitching.  Of course not.  Hey, Nathaniel, can you grab me that thing off my desk in the office?  Your desk? 
[00:13:30]  Oh.  You got a desk?  No, I don't.  I don't do.  But no bitching.  No bitching.  Whatever.  I mean.  Oh, God, that is funny.  I was thinking about it last night.  Yeah.  The reality is, and we've got to start realizing this, this radio show is just not a priority  with XM.  We know that now.  It's just not a priority.  We've accepted it.  We've turned around, put our hands on our head and smiled and gotten our nightstick in  the throat.  You know, it was all pomp and circumstance or whatever they say. 
[00:14:00]  Sure.  When we first got to XM.  Yeah.  And now it's like, we're just not a priority.  I understand that now.  Just one of many, many shows.  Yeah.  We're just this tiny little satellite that is separated from the Washington gang, and we'll  just do our show, and we'll be very successful on our own.  Yeah.  But we're not really a priority.  It's obvious.  Just one piece of the wide array of entertainment you get on XM Satellite Radio.  Remember when Howard signed with the little doggy company?  The first phone call we got was from the, you know, from Elo, I'll say, Elo. 
[00:14:30]  And he goes, hey, we got a little over a year to make you guys bigger than anything  out there.  And nothing has been, they will, they will beg to differ.  They will beg to differ.  Oh, really?  I'm sure.  Remember the national commercial we were going to do?  Well.  And now it's down to what?  A five second thing we're doing?  I think it's a ten second spot.  It's going to run during a traffic report.  And then they wonder why we bitch.  I mean, when, you know, when you're meeting with XM and they have these huge, huge plans 
[00:15:00]  for you, and one of them is to have a huge national ad campaign where we were throwing  around ideas.  Oh, we had a great idea.  Actually, Ope came up with this one.  Remember the movie Brubaker?  Yep.  And it's kind of a cliche to prison movie, so even if you didn't see this movie, it  still worked.  It was, and it had to be done right when we were signed and we were still off the  air, where Brubaker gets out of the hole and comes walking out of the prison and all 
[00:15:30]  the prisoners start to do the little slow applause thing and he's looking up.  I think it would have been, you know, cool to have me and Ope get out of the, get out  of some prison solitary confinement thing, come out squinting at the sunlight kind of  thing.  You know, we're out.  Yeah, we're back.  We're released.  We're back.  But, yeah.  No.  And they thought that was a great idea.  Like, yeah, we kind of like that and we'll...  Sign right here.  We'll get right on it.  Yeah, we'll talk about other ideas for this national TV commercial. 
[00:16:00]  You'll be huger than huge.  Sign on the dotted line.  Well, we're going to be on TV very soon, ladies and gentlemen.  Featured in 10 second spots.  Yeah.  Don't look for your pals either.  Don't look for your pals.  What you're going to see is a Wi-Fi.  And in the window, in the little window of the Wi-Fi, you're going to see Opie and Anthony's  show.  That's right.  And then there's going to be a VO, as they say in the business, of your pals, Ant and 
[00:16:30]  I, doing about five seconds of audio.  Why don't you do the VO, Billy?  Why don't you do it, Billy boy?  And I guess we're going to have a production session tomorrow, because you get so creative  with five seconds.  I can't wait.  Five seconds.  You know, I could pretty much riff for two or three seconds, but five?  I'm lost.  I don't know what to do.  And we talked about this during our conference call yesterday for about 20 minutes. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  It's like, it's five seconds.  You know what you could say in five seconds?  Nothing.  It's, hey, it's Opie and Anthony, we're back, and we couldn't be happier.  Sign up today, XM Salary Radio.  No, you're out of time.  Oh, that was sick.  Sorry.  See?  Yeah.  What?  I liked the...  And it's going to be like local TV and some markets.  So much for that national commercial.  Oh, well.  And then they wonder why we bitch and we're a little bitter.  I liked the idea that some things are going to be written for us.  We could try them out. 
[00:17:30]  See how they work.  Right.  Because I guess they couldn't take a five-second clip from this show.  Because from what I was gathering, what we do here on the show isn't really a good representation of the show.  See, we need someone to write something that represents this show better than, say, the show.  So we have to deal with that.  It's going to be fun.  Yeah, we'll have the outtakes from our production session.  Oh, yeah.  On Friday's show, I guess. 
[00:18:00]  Five seconds at a pop.  Let's go to Doug Out Doug from whackbag.com.  Of course, Doug Out Doug.  Of course.  Hey, Doug, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  How are we doing today?  Pretty good.  Good morning, my postman of football's old cobweb-infested burb vagina lips.  He's calling from...  Hi, Doug with a bad phone.  It's not a bad phone.  This is a problem that's been happening, but we don't want to bitch.  But we've been talking about this problem for a while.  So, do you guys ever watch the news and you see where all the troops get together and they say go to attack Canada and Canada isn't there anymore? 
[00:18:30]  I'm sorry.  I can't get past this Star Wars Death Star transmission sound that's going on in the background.  Every time you talk, I get this weird digital feedback sound.  I'm sorry.  All right.  It's not you, sir.  It's not your fault, Doug.  It's not like you need phones to do a talk show.  Don't complain.  I'm sure it's not a priority.  Did you ever get a bunch of troops together to go attack?  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  And there was nobody to attack?  Okay.  I am your father.  There you go.  Hey, can we have a schedule for a cool guy, please?  We don't know what it is.  I have no idea what Doug said because I'm literally ready to punch my fist through the phone system, which is a computer.  Thank you, Doug.  That should be really funny because the computer has nothing to do with the actual phone system. 
[00:19:30]  I guess what he was trying to say is the assault on cool guy started last night and I guess he didn't do his radio show last night.  I think we made our point so you guys could, like, go about your business, you know?  Yeah.  We certainly made our point.  We're not obsessed with the guy.  We said what we had to say yesterday about him.  Might I add that, of course, I tuned in because I knew all those psychos from Whack Bag were lined up and it was going to be awful.  Yeah.  And he didn't do the show, but the music was very enjoyable.  It was.  Credit where it's due.  Yeah, I couldn't turn it off. 
[00:20:00]  Were you angered by that?  Oh, it really annoyed me how much I enjoyed the songs.  Even the night before when he was trashing me, the thing that hurt the most, it wasn't being trashed.  It was being trashed as he went in to play Sabbath, the thrill of it all.  I've never heard that on the radio.  It was as happy as I've ever been.  I'm hearing myself bashed as I'm tapping my fat feet.  That was very hurt.  That stinks.  The thrill of it all.  You want to hate it.  You just want to hate it so much.  Oh, I'm like, oh, this scumbag.  I turned on his kiss, shouted out loud. 
[00:20:30]  I'm like, ah, I was so happy.  Oh, brother.  That's very funny.  Things were good.  The music channels on XM have gotten a lot better since we got here.  I've noticed a major improvement.  A major.  I was doing my MiFi thing in the park yesterday.  I was skating around, checking out all those.  Oh, the gates?  I wasn't checking out the gates.  You went to check out the gates?  No, I checked out the gates over the weekend, and I admitted that.  And I had an open mind, but I just don't get it still.  With the little bit more height you get from the blades,  can you touch the curb? 
[00:21:00]  You can touch them just walking.  You can?  Oh, yeah.  You can touch the saffron.  Are people jumping up to touch them?  Most people don't have to jump up.  Really?  I mean, someone like Rich Voss would have to maybe get a stepladder,  but I was able to just kind of touch it.  Yeah.  But now, you know, there's a bike.  It's not even a bike path.  They closed the road to traffic, the Outer Loop.  Yeah.  And, you know, I'll do my inline skating.  People are biking.  People are jogging.  And these stupid tourists are just wandering around with dumb maps  trying to find the gates. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, boy.  The gates are all over Central Park, but for some reason they have maps.  But I'm looking for gate 4,863.  They're all the same gate.  They all look the same.  Right.  And people are just wandering in the road.  And, man, you know, the regulars, they're working out, skating and biking.  I mean, there's hardcore guys in there with, you know, all the latest gear and stuff.  I mean, they rock and roll around that Outer Loop.  Yeah.  And people just getting pissed off on their bikes and on their blades and the joggers. 
[00:22:00]  Any time something brings in a lot of tourists, it really is a bitch for the locals.  And, you know, it's New York City, so you're going to get a lot of tourists.  They don't understand.  Get out of our way.  We live and work here.  Please leave.  Put this stupid thing in an Iowa cornfield.  The gates.  Hey, Rich Voss.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up, Rich?  Can you hear me?  Give us a feedback.  A little bit of that feedback going on. 
[00:22:30]  The phone's snaked, dude.  I got a broke early and my fiancé said to give you guys a call.  I didn't say that.  My other one.  I guess we just don't go to the phones today.  That's just a small part of the show we have to cut out.  That's all, O.  This is ridiculous.  Yeah, we can't hear you, bro.  We can kind of hear you, but...  Call me tomorrow morning or I'll come in.  I'll call you guys.  This is...  I'm in a limo right now and I can't deal with it.  He's in a limo? 
[00:23:00]  He just called to say that.  I know.  I know.  He absolutely called to say he's in a limo.  Hey, what about the controversy with Chris Rock and the Oscars?  You know what?  First of all, there are a bunch of babies.  What Chris is doing is so funny.  And they know what they're getting.  And they...  And, you know...  I just want to see Opie throw something.  That's why I'm keeping him on the phone.  This is...  Well, you can't hear it.  Opie...  You know what?  It stinks.  Let's call Sonny Fox.  There you go. 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  Voss's phone is not...  That's two bad phones in a row.  Yeah, that's this phone, though.  That's our phone.  Anytime they talk, it does that feedback thing.  There's something feeding back.  But we've mentioned this over and over again.  Kevin Straley, will you do something?  Stop.  Will you fucking do something?  Instead of, I'll look into this, I'll look into that.  There's real problems here.  You can't do a talk show without phones. 
[00:24:00]  Opie, the tech guys are coming.  You've been in talk radio for many, many years.  Will you do something?  The tech guys are coming.  That's what I heard.  Well, when?  When?  My email said TBA.  Ooh.  So I'm waiting for the big announcement as to when they're showing up.  I even wrote back in a nice way, hey, when is TBA?  Like, is there...  Is it...  I put...  Is it a week?  A month?  Two months?  And you know what I got?  No answer. 
[00:24:30]  TBA.  So, I don't know.  When they feel it's a good time to show up, they'll be here.  Look, if the phone's just crapped out today, then, you know, I don't really have a leg to stand on, obviously.  But if it's something that's been ongoing and we've mentioned on the show, you know, nicely...  Yeah, the phones have been doing this for a while.  I don't know what to say anymore.  Hey, Craig, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Listen, every time I listen to your guys' program, which is actually when they got their back 
[00:25:00]  on the air, any callers that you get in, you can barely hear the callers.  You turn up the volume, you guys get back on the radio, and then all of a sudden, you  guys have powered the speakers up like you wouldn't believe me.  Boy, your ear comes out.  You know, maybe it helps your peers hearing this, but I don't know.  TBA, throw the bullshit again, you know?  Is there something that can be turned down or up somewhere that doesn't make that sound?  Hey, Derek, you got the live version of Freebird? 
[00:25:30]  If you do, play it, because I'm not doing a fucking radio show anytime soon.  What?  What?  By the way, you guys missed the whole thing on Voss's call there.  He just got engaged.  Is that what he said?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  We got engaged.  He said Jim knew, and Jim was supposed to tell everyone.  I didn't want him to tell everyone.  I didn't want him to tell everyone.  I didn't want him to tell everyone.  I didn't want him to tell everyone.  Voss didn't want to break that news for himself.  Well, the phones are crapping out, so we're going to fix the phones. 
[00:26:00]  We're going to reset it all.  Reset it?  Yeah.  When?  How long does that take?  A couple of minutes.  A couple of minutes?  Okay.  All right.  Let's take a breath.  It's awful.  I know.  I heard it.  It's really bad today.  So we missed the Voss engagement announcement.  I heard it, though.  I don't know if the list was wrong.  I heard it in the office.  I heard him say, I just got engaged.  Wow.  Did he say not to you, Jim, or something?  Oh, no.  He said my fiancé.  Oh, fiancé. 
[00:26:30]  No, I didn't.  I thought he was just joking.  Because he's called you his fiancé.  Yeah, yeah.  For a year.  He didn't just be the Paul Mooney as his fiancé.  You know, how emasculating that was?  He really got engaged?  Oh, Giovanni, yeah.  This is serious.  I just didn't want to mention it.  I figured I'd let Rich tell you on the show.  Yeah, he's in love, man.  Isn't he a one-time loser as far as marriage goes?  He's a one-time loser as far as life is concerned, but she's actually very good for him.  They balance each other out very well.  They get along.  Yeah, they're great together.  It annoys me, but they really are.  She's good for him.  She's much too good for him. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  How the hell is he scoring a girl like that?  I don't know.  Wow.  Voss must really be good in bed.  You think?  I don't know.  Apparently.  He'll show you a photo of his junk to prove it.  No, he'll just open his wallet and hold it up after four Levitras.  Oh, how awful is that going to look, seeing her nice feminine hands putting a ring on  that little stump of a finger, little finger of his?  I bet you every time he puts his hand down, the ring falls off and clanks on the floor  because the knuckle really doesn't hold it. 
[00:27:30]  With this ring, I think he's wedged.  Oh.  Oh.  Is he going to?  I wonder if he's going to do it up.  Has he talked to you about this?  A real, like, big wedding?  I don't think he's...  A lot of times the...  Is it her first marriage?  I don't know.  I think so.  Hmm.  I don't know.  Because, like, for him, I'm sure he wouldn't care if he does it up real big.  He's already been married before.  But if it's the girl's first marriage, then, you know, you've got to kind of, you know,  bite the bullet for the chick.  Once we reset the phones, maybe we can call him because he's in a limo.  He's in a limo. 
[00:28:00]  I'd love to know who he's driving.  Where to, sir, with the stupid cap on?  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break so they can reset the phones.  I see it's being reset as we speak.  Is that happening?  Hope so.  So, see if they work.  Well, like, the live version of Freebird's too long, huh?  That might really piss people off.  Not only that, but, oh, to have to listen to it four and five more times on the replays? 
[00:28:30]  Oh.  That's a good point, too.  That's pretty goddamn brutal.  I've noticed a lot of things.  You know, no, I'm not bitching here about anything, but there are certain things that  play, and they play, like, four times a day.  And I know, maybe I listen too much because I'm here for the whole show when we do it,  and then I listen to the replay to hear what it sounds like, and then maybe later on when  it's on in the bedroom or something, I'll walk in.  I'll hear, like, the same thing three times.  Like, oh, shut up.  Shut up.  And I'm talking to myself.  You know, shut up. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, a little crackling noise for the phone being fixed.  That was nice.  Well, that's the beauty of the MiFi, though.  Yeah.  You can listen to it whenever you want.  Yeah.  Well, the parts of the show you want, actually.  Yeah.  All right, well, from the Grammys the other night, here's a bunch of dopes getting together  to sing across the universe.  Is that how they promote it when they brought them all out?  And now a bunch of dopes!  And this was for the tsunami victims, so check it out, and we'll continue.  A bunch of dopes.  Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup. 
[00:29:30]  They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe.  A beautiful wave of love, drifting through my open mind, caressing in thrift for me. 
[00:30:00]  A beautiful day, nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Nothing's gonna change my world. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, images of broken light which stands before me like a million eyes that call me on and on across the universe.  Watch me out and look like a restless wind inside a letterbox.  They tumble blindly as they make the way across the universe. 
[00:31:00]  What a beautiful day, and a good day.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world 
[00:31:30]  Sounds of laughter, shades of light  I find it through my open views  Inside it and inviting me  Living this love, love  Shines around me like a million suns  It goes me on and on  Across the universe  I've been loving you, neighbor  Nothing's gonna change my world 
[00:32:00]  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world  Nothing's gonna change my world  All right, now  All right, now  All right, now 
[00:32:30]  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world 
[00:33:00]  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  You know that, come on  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world  Something's gonna change my world 
[00:33:30]  Something's gonna change my world  I came up with something years ago  Basically it says  Whip them out, well, baby  Big, luscious, juicy ones  Ready?  Wow  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy  Wow 
[00:34:00]  It's Whip them out, what do you say?  The O.B.M. Anthony Show  Yes  Fake country music  The country music of China  That album, you know, didn't sell well  But there were some fantastic country songs in there  Like  Bring me back my bowl of rice, you bitch  This didn't go well  That wasn't a good song 
[00:34:30]  And it was somewhat offensive  And this one  Well, the Yank Sea flooded again  There's blood in my clogs  And my whole family was crushed by giant logs  Well, they're damming the river up in the three gorges  And I might have sex with a pig 
[00:35:00]  That was a weird song  That was a weird song  I don't really understand, you know  I don't think the translation was good, though  It was very bad  In fact  I might have sex with a pig  That's not, you know  Do you like it?  No  I don't like it  And who would?  They never call  And if by accident 
[00:35:30]  They do call  The phone has fallen off its hook at the farm  And they've gotten a duck to poke the numbers  All you'll hear is  They're not good talkers  Pigs  They don't care about your personal life  They don't care about you  They just take, take, take  Yeah  And then we kill them 
[00:36:00]  So they  I guess they deserve all they can  So  XM202  The O.B. and Anthony Show  I've been too tremendous  That from all our eyes  This is the darling of the rest of our lives  On holiday  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony program  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday 
[00:36:30]  Thanks for joining us  I guess we  We reset the phones, Anthony  So we'll see how this goes  Ooh  It's a mystery now  Who knows if they're going to work or not  If we pop it down and hear that sound  Oh, I'm just going to flee to a bomb shelter  I'm going to run for my life  We just want to put on a fine, entertaining radio show every morning  Well, it's hard enough to do without 
[00:37:00]  Without having technical problems, you know  Because we usually don't go to the phones first thing in the morning  But I looked over there  There was a lot of cool little things that we could have riffed on, you know  Voss has given us huge news  And the phone system stinks  We could have done 20 to 30 minutes on the Voss thing alone  No problem  But instead  We have to sit and wait for the phones to be reactivated  Or whatever they  Whatever was done  That was a big announcement for Voss 
[00:37:30]  All right, let's see if they're working here  Max in Dallas  Hey, Max, what's up?  Hey, boys, how's the phones now?

[00:46:30]  Thank you. 
[00:47:00]  Thank you. 
[00:47:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:48:00]  Thank you. 
[00:48:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Come on, what do you got?  No, Mr. Romano.  Please, don't get me out. 
[00:49:00]  Come on, what do you got?  No, Mr. Romano.  No, Mr. Romano. 
[00:49:30]  No, Mr. Romano. 
[00:50:00]  No, Mr. Romano.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Kill him.  Stop whining.  Kill him.  Stop whining.  Kill him.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Ah, sticks.  Mr. Roboto.  Oh.  Oh.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Wow, the instant feedback's coming in.  They love it, right?  Fast Freddy. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, we didn't break the phones.  Stop playing this awful fucking music already.  F you.  What's next?  The Thompson Twins?  Ooh, which one?  Hold Me Now.  There you go.  That's the next one.  Hold Me Now.  Glenn in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  What do you got for the show today?  I just wanted to call and thank little Jimmy Norton for absolutely horrified my wife this  weekend at the Stress Factory.  Oh, thank you.  Now she thinks I'm some demented fuck. 
[00:51:00]  Why did he horrify your wife?  Well, with, you know, his, you know.  His brand of humor.  His humor that he has.  His brand of humor.  Well, thank you for coming, sir.  I apologize for my potty mouth.  Oh, no.  I loved it, but now she thinks I'm some, you know.  Creep.  Serial killer.  Are the phones back working?  How come that's working?  If another call works, don't touch anything else on the phones.  Right.  Let's see if Eric the Trucker has anything.  Eric.  Yeah, guys.  Hey, last night, I don't know if this guy got a signals post about where the 
[00:51:30]  he was supposed to do was attack, but last night around about 7.38 o'clock,  a guy calls up MLB Live, says that he's Jimmy from Houston,  and that he was sitting there talking to Opie, and then he said yeah,  and you said yeah, and everything else.  Then he goes off and he says, well, you can get information about the  Fairwoods deal on www.biteatabullet, and then about that point,  he figured out what he was doing.  That's the new Major League Baseball channel on 175. 
[00:52:00]  As a matter of fact, I think we're going to have Kevin Kennedy call in the  program today.  We love those.  I heard about those, like, they threw in some O&A stuff,  but I didn't hear any of the calls.  Thanks, Eric.  Thanks, man.  Wow.  Do they work?  I think the phones are now working 50 minutes into the show.  So make sure no one's touching anything, because I like when people fix  something, and then they go further to keep fixing it, even after it's fixed, 
[00:52:30]  and then it just breaks again.  So we've got to leave that alone.  Wow.  Some great stuff coming in from AssSuckWillie on Wackbag.  What I just wrote to Kevin Straley.  Dear faggot, Opie and Anthony is the only priority you have, dummy.  So I guess he's going to be getting a lot of those emails.  He'll get a lot of emails today.  Yeah.  He's going to log on and go, oh, I have so many in my inbox.  Let me see who this is from. 
[00:53:00]  Well, maybe he'll finally get the point.  I mean, we've been talking about the phones off and on since we started here.  We really have.  What seemed to be the problem, Ben?  Ben, I'm like, Ben, the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony program.  What was the problem with the mix minus?  There was someone messed with the mix minus in that studio.  I don't realize it.  Perhaps that's a problem with the phones.  We've had this problem before.  Perhaps that problem keeps popping up because somebody's using that studio.  Somebody's fiddling with everything set and somebody fiddled with it. 
[00:53:30]  That's not supposed to.  No one's supposed to be in there to screw with anything.  No one's supposed to.  And I hear tell that somebody was in the studio doing a phone interview yesterday when they shouldn't be.  That's got to be taken care of.  Yeah, we'll fix it.  So, anyway, because I was in the studio with Steve yesterday doing some stuff.  And I know he said, yeah, so-and-so's got to use this studio for a phone interview.  Who's so-and-so?  Just say it.  I don't know what his name is. 
[00:54:00]  The Broadway guy.  I don't know what his name is.  I don't know him either.  The Broadway guy was doing a phoner?  That's what I've heard, yeah.  And perhaps it could happen that somebody turned something they shouldn't have turned and screwed up our phones.  Yeah.  And screwed up an hour of the show.  Yeah, good.  Good.  Next time, we'll just play some Broadway tunes.  Which one do you want to hear?  I don't know.  Something maybe from Oklahoma?  Or Don't Cry For Me, Argentina.  That's a favorite of mine.  How about something from Jesus Christ Superstar?  Or West Side Story? 
[00:54:30]  The classics?  How about Bye Bye Birdie?  Or something from Rent?  Rent?  Or how about just a song on Broadway?  Play something from Rent, do some crystal meth, and have ass sex.  Spread that high-speed AIDS.  The great AIDS, yeah.  Wow.  All right, we could start singing into a real show, I guess.  Oh, right.  Super AIDS hit New York.  Super AIDS!  It hit Boston.  Yeah.  And now the paper is reporting. 
[00:55:00]  Yes, it has hit California.  It's in California?  Officials are trying to identify and find a San Diego resident who tested positive.  for a form of HIV similar to the aggressive drug-resistant strain discovered last week in New York City  that turns into full-blown AIDS in just months.  How handy that AIDS is.  You don't have to sit around and wait for it.  Yeah.  It's the Express AIDS.  The excella of AIDS.  So Super AIDS has made its way to California.  Came down from the Fortress of Solitude. 
[00:55:30]  There it is.  AIDS, my son.  Go down and infect the planet.  Big A on his shirt.  Flying fist first into man's asses.  And then in part two, three of them come,  Houston, we're here to sodomize you.  Kneel before Zod.  And suck my dick. 
[00:56:00]  Zod.  Zod.  Zod.  Zod ruled.  Yeah.  Super AIDS is out there.  Now it's in New York, Boston, and San Diego.  And San Diego, California.  And the mayor of New York City has a great way to keep Super AIDS under wraps.  Yeah.  Super AIDS.  He's going to be under control.  It's a kryptonite.  It's a city council.  Oh, I thought it was the mayor.  City council has gone to the mayor and asked him to do something about this before it gets 
[00:56:30]  out of control.  And their answer is, mayor, you have to crack down on the crystal meth problem.  That's what they're blaming for this Super AIDS.  They're saying that crystal meth leads to this promiscuous, unprotected, gay sex.  I don't know about that.  So if a straight guy does crystal meth, next thing you know he's going to be getting banged 
[00:57:00]  up the rear?  I'll admit, back in the 80s, I did a couple of toots of crystal meth.  Are you insane?  I have never in my life had a yearning for man-ass after doing that.  Never.  Crystal meth?  You did crystal meth?  A little crystal meth.  I was checking it out during my cocaine days.  My cocaine days?  Everyone had some cocaine days, didn't they?  Except Jimmy.  Jimmy didn't do no drugs.  Did you do coke?  Are you kidding?  I used to smoke it.  Did you?  Yeah, I loved it. 
[00:57:30]  I think I'm sober at 18.  Yeah.  Jimmy figured out very early on that the drug thing wasn't for him.  I got off the drugs about, stopped doing anything back in, like, 86, I guess, around  there.  Yeah, about 86.  It was a short-lived period in the 80s that I was doing some coke and, yeah, smoking it,  free-basing it up.  And, yeah, and then my brother would, like, bring home some crystal meth.  Oh, let's check that out. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, it burns.  All of a sudden, you're wired out of your gourd for, you know, the whole night.  Compared to coke, what does it do to you?  It just gives you that speedy buzz.  It's not that euphoric kind of cool, no matter what you say is cool, cocaine buzz, you know.  You do coke, you get that speedy type thing, but you're also feeling pretty good.  Crystal meth, you just do it and you're like, you have all this energy and you need to choke  a hooker or something, you know, you're out of your mind.  And it burns. 
[00:58:30]  It doesn't cut up into lines like coke either.  It's like rubber cement.  It just burns.  Does it look like crank?  Yeah.  I've done crank.  You did crank?  Like the same thing.  In high school, yeah, sure.  Yeah, crank and crystal meth are the same thing.  Oh, it's just a different word for, oh, I hadn't heard, I didn't realize it.  Okay.  Crank.  Yeah, good stuff.  Good stuff.  Let's try it.  Oof.  Yeah, and then it just got to the point where it was, you know, you just know it's bad for  you.  It's bad for your wallet. 
[00:59:00]  It's bad for everything.  And then I just went, you know something?  I'm not doing this anymore.  It wasn't one of those, you know, and then I hit rock bottom and had to, it was just,  you know, you assess the situation and go, I'm sitting in my apartment doing coke wondering,  you know, hey, where can I get a little more?  Or, you know, you kind of look at the carpet and notice a big pretzel salt fell on the  floor and you're kind of eyeing it like, I can put that in the pipe and see if it melts  into the screen.  And you go, ah, you know, I think I've had enough of this stuff. 
[00:59:30]  So is this quick cold turkey?  Yeah, because it wasn't.  Never really had the urge again?  No, no, not at all, ever.  It was that, but the girl I was with at the time was still doing it.  So that kind of broke up that relationship too.  She wouldn't stop.  And I hadn't become like one of those, and you will stop doing it.  But I'm like, you know something?  I tried instilling my wisdom on her saying, you know, maybe you shouldn't be doing this.  It's really not good.  It's, you know, you're spending your money on it and stuff.  And she said, all right, you know, I'm not going to do it anymore. 
[01:00:00]  And then she'd come home and her jaw is going a mile a minute and her eyes are all open.  And she's trying to say she wasn't doing it.  So I'm like, all right.  Trying to move on.  Same chick I hit with the homemade stun gun.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Carrie, her name was.  Why did you hit her with the stun gun again?  I forget this story.  I want to see if it worked.  I had gotten a schematic.  You went to Radio Shack or something, right?  And made your own stun gun?  Yeah, I got a schematic to build a stun gun.  Yeah, okay.  You know, so I went to Radio Shack. 
[01:00:30]  I was bored.  I bought a bunch of the, you know, resistors, capacitors and stuff and a circuit board.  A couple of prongs that I got, I guess, from Larry's Hobby Shop.  They were actually two axles for model airplane landing gear.  I got the plastic case from Radio Shack, the little blue cases and the buttons and stuff.  And soldered it all together.  And I guess I didn't have the contacts close enough together where they would arc when you hit it.  Because, you know, a stun gun goes bzzz, bzzz.  So it wouldn't arc. 
[01:01:00]  So I didn't know if it worked or not.  So she was sitting on the couch.  And I was sure if I built it, it wasn't going to work.  And I kind of just touched her leg with it and hit the button.  Oh, bam!  She down.  She just went down.  Did she flop like a fish?  No.  It didn't have the real power of a professional stun gun.  So she didn't go out or anything like that.  But it shocked the shit out of her.  And she was pissed.  She starts crying. 
[01:01:30]  I felt all bad that I hit her with this stun gun.  That's insane.  But, you know, there was this little bit of pride that I had that it actually worked.  Of course.  That I soldered it together myself and it actually worked.  What a tool.  Ah, then we did more coke.  Ah, the good old days.  You broke out the bag of coke and everything was okay, right?  Yeah, then everything's fine again.  That solved that fight.  Sure.  Anthony from Oceanside.  What's up, Anthony? 
[01:02:00]  Anthony.  Anthony.  Hey, jackass, humming to yourself.  Anthony.  All right.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Opie.  Opie.  Anthony.  Jimmy.  I can't hear you guys.  Anthony.  I can't hear you guys.  You can't hear us?  Hey, jackass, humming to yourself. 
[01:02:30]  He's turning over.  I can't hear you guys.  I can't hear you.  Anthony.  You can't hear us?  Hello?  Anthony.  Can't hear you guys.  Opie.  Can't hear you.  Opie.  Can't hear you.  Yeah.  I can't hear you.  Hello.  Anthony.  Yeah, now I can hear you.  Jesus Christ.  What happened?  What changed?  Yeah, all I heard was, like, they were going to pick up my call, and that was it.  I guess they're still screwing with stuff. 
[01:03:00]  Well, I'm so glad the phones are working.  Anyway, what do you have for the show?  Listen, crystal meth?  I'm a druggist.  I'm a pharmacist.  It was invented by the slanty-eyed Jap fucks in World War II.  We could thank them for all the super-age due to the fucking crystal meth.  Thank the Japs, those pricks.  Wait a minute.  The Japs?  What do the Japs have to do with crystal meth?  In World War II?  In World War II.  Can you listen?  Yes, I can.  The Kamikaze pilots and all those crazy fucking warriors, they had D-methylamphetamine, which 
[01:03:30]  is the chemical composition of crystal meth.  Yeah.  What do you think?  They just, for love of country and fucking rice, they were slamming into boats and buildings  with those planes?  No.  They were all crazed.  They were stoned out of their fucking minds.  Look it up, man.  They were all hopped up, having ass sex, and then going out and crashing into planes and  into boats.  And when they come into the pharmacy for fucking needles to shoot that shit up, they look like  a fucking train wreck.  All of them.  Ah, give me two swinches.  Ah!  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right.  Anthony sounds like he's on it.  But I don't get the connection between crystal meth and ass sex. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, see, that's what the city council, that's what they were saying.  Maybe we could get a brave homosexual to call the program and explain why crystal meth  makes you want to have ass sex.  A homosexual?  I don't think we'll get one of those on our show.  Why not?  Just change your name and explain why crystal meth makes you want to have anal sex.  Or why you wouldn't ask the guy to put a bag on just because you're a little bit rushed.  I think what it does is if you are gay and you are enjoying the man-ass sex, doing some 
[01:04:30]  crystal meth will make you just that much more aggressive and horny for it.  You know?  If you're speeding out, you're kind of, you know, it gets you horny, too, I would gather,  you know.  And I think it's just they act on that.  Get into that.  Not thinking about, you know, they're all hopped up.  They're not thinking about rubbers or anything.  So you have the unprotected sex. 
[01:05:00]  Get the AIDS.  Get the super AIDS.  Get the super AIDS if you have, you know, 70-plus partners.  Let's go to Jim the trucker.  Jim?  Hello.  Hey, Jim.  Am I on?  Yeah, Jim.  Okay.  I can barely hear you guys.  Yeah.  Kevin, you're doing a great job.  Thanks.  Thanks for all the help, you ass.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  San Francisco now has the super AIDS virus as well. 
[01:05:30]  Well, welcome.  Welcome to the family, San Fran.  How do you know that San Francisco also has the super AIDS?  Ah, there was a write-up in the newspaper about the gays in San Francisco  are suing the public recs department.  They're saying that they're getting AIDS from toilet seats.  After further investigation, they found out they were sitting down  before the other fucker was done.  That old gag. 
[01:06:00]  All right, we might have an old hack joke.  We may have a homosexual.  Sauce, what's up?  Hi.  I'm calling about.  I'm gay, and I live in Miami, and I know about the connection between  dextromethamphetamine.  I'm going to be a nurse, of course.  And, well, basically, it lowers your inhibitions.  So, you're going to fuck anything that moves, and that goes for straight people, too.  Oh, even straight people, if they do some of this crystal meth, 
[01:06:30]  they will just be drawn to madness.  No, they're not.  Well, it just lowers your inhibitions, whether you're straight or gay,  meaning if you're a straight guy doing crystal meth,  you'll take chances with your straight sex as well, right?  Exactly.  Oh, I thought he meant you'd turn gay.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I didn't mean that.  I mean that you may go without a condom.  You may go without, you know, you'll just do it.  I mean, it's crazy. 
[01:07:00]  It's like you lose your inhibitions completely.  And injectors are also more prone to infections such as hepatitis C, et cetera, et cetera.  Well, we all know that.  Do you do the crystal meth?  No, when I was a kid, I experimented with it.  And sex was awesome on it.  You were drawn to the man-ass?  Yeah.  What is it about the man-ass? 
[01:07:30]  What is it about the man-ass?  I don't know, but I guess it's in my DNA.  Do you like everything about it, the smell of it?  Well, I don't want to get into that detail, but vagina kind of doesn't do it for me.  Oh, my God.  You know, that's what I don't get.  Because you place a picture of a vagina right next to a picture of a man's ass.  Yeah.  It's not even close.  No.  It's not even close.  It's not.  Not any decision-making there at all. 
[01:08:00]  I mean, try to, like, somehow have an open mind and just look at the two pictures.  It's not even close.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Sauce.  Sauce.  I tried.  I tried.  I'm not a man's ass.  I tried, but I couldn't do it.  I couldn't do it.  Oh, I was going to ask you, have you ever had straight sex?  I had a threesome, and I tried.  That's why I believe that the homosexual thing is in your genes, because to look at a man's  ass and go, that's what I want.  That's what I want.  It's like, look, man.  I mean.  Yeah, I mean, I asked a straight guy, I'm like, okay, now think about it this way. 
[01:08:30]  Could you possibly go, you know, gay?  I mean, could you possibly go, you know, rim a guy's ass?  No, you can't.  That's the answer.  Did you try it with a girl?  Yeah, I tried.  Like you put it in and everything?  The flag didn't go full staff at all.  No, huh?  You are so gay.  Yeah.  You just look at those things and boing, if you're not gay, you know? 
[01:09:00]  All right, Sauce.  Well, thank you for helping us out with this connection thing.  Okay, thank you.  And thanks for listening.  We appreciate it.  Patrick in New York.  There was a gay bartender that worked at one of the comedy clubs.  Yeah.  And he said that he went to Fire Island and this gay other guy got picked him up and was  eating his cheeks, but was blowing into him like, so he would fart in the other guy's  face.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, Jim.  That's true.  That's what he was telling us.  We all could not stop listening.  Ah. 
[01:09:30]  Patrick from New York.  Hey, how are you?  We're good, Patrick.  What's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to add that the guys who are doing the crystal meth, one of the things  that the ass sex becomes appealing to them is that they're horny, but they can't fuck  because their dick is soft.  So they end up wanting to take it up the ass because they're horny, but they can't get  their own dick hard, so they look for someone else to fuck them.  Wait, so if you're on the crystal meth, you got a softy? 
[01:10:00]  So you're going to be a bottom.  Right, exactly.  All right, well, we got the, we're figuring out the connection today, Anthony.  Yes.  Mike from New Orleans.  What's up, Mike?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Same thing.  Definitely with the meth, you are not getting a rod.  There's no way.  Any kind of amphetamine usually makes you, makes it so you, it's very hard to get a rod, but  once you do, it's the whole frigging night.  You might as well be on Viagra. 
[01:10:30]  I never understood how guys said they would take Coke and rub it on their mule to stay.  I could never, it would just, it would have deadened it for me and I would have had no  desire to have sex.  Who's wasting Coke on their mule?  Tony Montana's got a mountain of it on his desk, you'll flop it in there.  Oh yeah.  You usually have a little vial, but who's rubbing it on their mule?  Oh, I've heard stories about people have done that so they can have sex longer.  And does it work?  Apparently it does.  I mean, for me it wouldn't, I'm so weird that I would do nothing from it.  Seems like it wouldn't numb it through your skin, but.  All right, man, why don't we take a break?  We're starting to get the show back on track here, okay? 
[01:11:00]  Back on track?  We're talking about man-ass.  Well, I understand.  Super AIDS has hit New York, it's hit Boston, and now it's hit California.  Everyone has AIDS!  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  Everyone has AIDS!  And so this is the end of our story.  And everyone is dead from AIDS. 
[01:11:30]  It took from me my best friend.  My only true pal.  My only bright star.  He's not AIDS.  Well, I'm gonna march on Washington.  He's a fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us.  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS.  My sister, AIDS.  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  The gays and the straights and the whites and the spades. 
[01:12:00]  Everyone has AIDS!  My grandma and my dog are all blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  The Pope has got it and so do you.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  Come on, everybody.  We got quilting to do.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS!  We're gonna break down these barricades, everyone.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Welcome to the open and...  Hello?  Hi, Ma.

[01:14:30]  Now, this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little controversy,  because it feels so empty without me.  I'm saying this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need  a little controversy, because it feels so empty without me.  La, la, la.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  He was trying to tell us something about an hour ago.  Max, what's going on, buddy? 
[01:15:00]  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Faithful listener of the program, by the way.  I recognize Max's voice.  What's up, Max?  Yeah.  I was listening to the replay of Russ Martin down in Dallas last night, and I guess he's  got, like, two websites, a free one and one you've got to subscribe to, so you guys  can probably get the audio from it.  But somebody sent him an air check of Ron and Don, and they were making fun out of it,  and they were talking about all the people that's trying to get his time slot down there,  and I guess Ron and Don was one, and somebody else, somebody else, and he said, oh, yeah, 
[01:15:30]  Opie and Anthony.  And he said, somebody from your show or one of you guys or something sent him an email  like you were trying to make friends with him and took your name off of it or something  or other, and he said he found out it was from your show because of the web domain or  something.  And he's, I can't remember exactly all it said, but more or less, like, he's pissed off at  you guys and that you're pussies and he wasn't going to talk to you or something like that. 
[01:16:00]  Did he mention our name?  Yes, he did.  There you go.  Another guy that's got the virus that's going to help us get huge in radio again.  It's a big show about halfway through the show, so if you guys want to have your man  there, check out the website.  Dude, this guy is obsessed with our program.  I'll tell you what happened.  We were syndicated to the same station he was on in Dallas, and he claimed that I was writing  emails to him trying to be buddy-buddy with him.  Anthony knows everyone associated with the show. 
[01:16:30]  We just don't do that with other DJs, you know.  If we become friends because it happens, like, Ron and Fez are great friends of ours, then  great, but we don't go out of our way to make friends with anyone.  If it happens, no problem, okay?  So he claims that I was writing him over and over again emails trying to become his friend,  and then when he didn't become my friend or something, then I started trashing him and  saying, well, you're next, buddy.  We're going to take you down, and we're going to take your time slot.  It never happened.  And then the pussy program director at the time, who has since moved on to a much smaller 
[01:17:00]  market because the guy didn't have what it took to program at Dallas Radio Station, you  know, took Russ's side and claimed that I was lying and stuff, and then the general  manager got involved, and then Ken Stevens got involved, and it just didn't happen.  Another phony and another fraud in this stupid business.  I don't go around writing other jocks' emails.  Well, except for a cool guy.  No, he wrote me, and then, yeah, that exchange happened. 
[01:17:30]  You're right.  But I don't go out of my way to go, hey, we're new to Dallas, want to become friends?  Be my pal.  I could care less.  Russ Martin is a one-market jock.  I don't know him.  He's on in Dallas.  He's a douche.  He does afternoons in Dallas.  He's boring.  And he's successful in Dallas.  Great.  Congratulations.  But that's all he does.  One market.  Great.  Well, I think we've been a little more successful than that.  But that was raised back in the NAW days, and it was a dress, and you're like, no, we're 
[01:18:00]  not even on the guy.  And then the program director is calling me, and is like, you know, this is not cool.  I'm trying to have a synergy on this station.  And I'm like, buddy, I didn't do it.  And then he didn't believe me, and then I had to talk to the general manager, and then  Ken Stevens got involved.  And then we had Scott Colombo, who was the computer guru at NAW.  Great guy to this day.  We still love the guy.  And he actually did a whole report proving that all these emails were not coming from 
[01:18:30]  me.  Personally, I think it was Russ Martin, you know, doing a little something, something.  But I can't prove it.  But with the IP or whatever Scott did, he proved that the emails that were written to this guy  did not come from me, and they still didn't believe me.  Conspiracy.  They still didn't believe it.  Hey, guys, can I make a suggestion?  Yeah, maybe.  What I was wondering is, the way your interns screw up, like bringing Jimmy the nasty apples 
[01:19:00]  and all that shit, you guys ought to have like a dartboard of punishment, and let your  interns throw darts, and they've got to do the punishment.  Thank you, Max.  All right, he's back.  Rich Voss.  Hey, what's going on?  That's better.  Voss, an hour ago you were on, but the phone was so awful, and we were just losing our minds  that we had no idea what you were saying.  Are you trying to say that you're now engaged?  I'm not trying.  I am engaged now.  Well, yeah, we got confused, because you've called, you know, Norton, your fiancé, for 
[01:19:30]  many, many years.  So when you said my fiancé, I was just assuming you were talking about Norton.  No, Norton is, he's a fiancé.  Because you said my fiancé told me to call in, and I thought you had a conversation with  Norton, and then, you know, that's what that was about.  But you got engaged to Bonnie?  Yeah.  Congratulations, man.  Thank you.  We did a, not Valentine's Day, like early, like 3 a.m. in the morning at some crappy  hotel.  I did it.  Wait, not what day? 
[01:20:00]  It was, when was Valentine's Day?  Okay.  Monday.  I heard Valentine.  It was like Sunday at like 2 a.m. in the morning.  Well, that was officially Valentine's Day.  Yeah, but it wasn't like your typical thing.  We did it at, I did it at like a real crappy hotel, you know.  That is pretty typical.  And I gave her, I gave her a ring.  I go, you don't have to say yes if you don't want to.  I don't love my self-esteem.  How low is her?  She said yes.  All right, wait.  What?  I dreamed of this little girl. 
[01:20:30]  Uh-oh.  She dreams of it, though, since she was a little girl.  But it was nice.  And she said to me, when I gave her the ring, she goes, yes, I dreamed of this ever since  I was a little girl to become an American citizen.  Wait, walk us through it, though.  2 a.m., what happened?  Hold on.  Let me, hold on.  Hello?  Yeah.  All right, so.  Are you on the speakerphone now?  No, no, now I'm on the regular, you know, just, I pick her up at 2 a.m.  Yeah.  Well, I pick her up at 12 a.m. at the airport.  She's flying in from L.A.  All right. 
[01:21:00]  So then we go get something to eat, right?  Uh-huh.  Uh, and I time it right.  I take, uh, you know, half of my blue pill, and, uh, we go back.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, boss.  Blue pill.  Do you really have to take those pills all the time?  I don't have to.  No, I don't.  I don't have to.  Well, you were talking about that guy that put that, you know, uh, stuff on his penis  to keep it, you know, the Coke.  Yeah.  I did that once, not with Coke, with some stuff I bought at the store, and it numbs  it up, and then, like, I was doing it, I couldn't feel it, and then when I was done, it was 
[01:21:30]  all black and blue.  I broke, broke, broke, broke, blood, I can't, I, I broke blood then.  Ah.  You know what, what is the, hold on, what is the name of that stuff?  Because we used to talk about it on one of our old shows.  Uh, I don't know, Novocaine?  No, it has.  Stamina X?  I forgot the name of it, but.  I don't remember.  It's, supposedly, it's kind of, yeah, it just numbs up your rod.  It's horrible, it's horrible.  So, anyhow, so we did, so we go eat, and then we go back to that.  Where'd you eat, where'd you eat, knowing that you were going to pop the question?  At, at a diner on 22 and 30. 
[01:22:00]  Jesus, dude.  What a romantic you are.  Don't you know you gotta sit up nice, you gotta, like, go out to the really nice, it's,  it's, you know, Sunday, go out to a nice dinner, then to the nice hotel, and then pop  the question.  You started the evening at a diner.  All right, then what happened?  We went to the diner, and then we, uh, I made reservations, and we, uh, check into the Best Western.  Uh, oh, you're, you're a network star.  What are you doing?  Well, because I got a deal.  We were only staying there for, like, three hours, because we had to fly the next morning, 
[01:22:30]  so I got it for under 100, so I wanted to take the Best Western, right?  Right.  Uh, and I also got a deal on the ring.  I bought it for my friend.  Uh, so, we go to the Best Western, right?  So, well, first, earlier that night, I picked up the ring, right?  Picked up the ring for my friend.  Uh, he, he was in the bar, but he didn't.  So, so.  Secondhand ring.  And then once I had the ring, I already bought her diamond earrings for Valentine's Day,  but now I have the ring.  I'm thinking, well, can I, you know, bring the earrings back, because I don't want to 
[01:23:00]  give her too much stuff, you know?  Uh, I want to bring the earrings back, but then I'm thinking, ah, what the hell?  So, you know, now I got the ring, uh, then, you know, I picked up, we go to the diner,  we check into the Best Western, uh, and then, uh, I give her, uh, you know, she gives me  some Valentine's stuff, some nice stuff, uh, and then I give her the, the, the earrings  first.  And she looks at him, and she's kind of, like, happy, but you could tell, like, she's like,  ugh.  Why, was she expecting, uh, an engagement? 
[01:23:30]  Oh, she was probably, yeah, she was, all girls were expecting an engagement.  How small?  How small?  You weren't expecting it?  Hold on.  How small were the, the diamond earrings?  What's that?  How small were they?  That's why she went, ugh.  No, they weren't small.  Well, they're like, you know, they were like, uh, they're almost like a quarter carat a  piece, the earrings.  That's small.  Did you know they were small?  Did they just look big in your hands?  They looked like the Hope Diamond.  Yeah.  I mean, most women would say that that's small.  What, a quarter carat a piece? 
[01:24:00]  You said almost a quarter carat.  What's that?  You said almost.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Voss got him in that mine with the six other dwarfs.  Like a twelfth of a carat, whatever.  All right.  So she's like, oh, whatever.  Why?  She was kind of expecting that you were going to pop the question?  No, she was scared I was going to ask her, you know, but she figures, and I figure, you  know, she figured, well, I got this TV show with him, so I can't, you know, let me say  yes to the ring.  Well, anyhow.  So then I gave her the earrings, and then, uh, and then I said, oh, here, I got something 
[01:24:30]  else.  And I hand her a box.  You know, the, it's really a nice case, but it was, it had a couple of tips on it, because,  you know, I got it from my friend, the wooden, where the ring comes in.  You know, it would be really a beautiful ring case if it didn't have those two tips in  it, uh, you know, the dense or whatever.  So I give it, I open, she opens it up, and I go, you don't have to say yes, because I  was kind of nervous.  Well, uh, we got, we got Jamie, uh, from Whackbag saying, he had to tell Bonnie she didn't 
[01:25:00]  have to say yes, and then in quotations says, I'm going in to take a nap.  When I wake up, if the ring's on your finger, I'll know I have a partner.  If it isn't, I'll know I don't.  So, uh, no, we were, we were, we were, uh, destined, because, you know, we get along great.  She's, she's cool, she's funny.  Now, now, Rich, is this her first marriage?  Yeah, it's her first marriage.  Her first.  So this, you don't understand how special this is.  What's that?  You obviously don't understand how special this is. 
[01:25:30]  If this was, like, her second marriage, then the, the little motel and the cheap diner  and stuff is, you know, that's fine, but this is her first, and girls do think about this  when they're little girls and stuff, and this is the culmination of that, is Voss and a diner  and then a motel?  A Best Western.  A Best Western?  Yeah, but it was three stars, first of all.  What's the big deal?  I mean, you know.  It's not a big deal to you.  You've already failed at it once.  Yeah, so?  It's a big deal to her.  It's not a big deal to her. 
[01:26:00]  Now, she gets to become an American citizen.  She's from Canada, so, I mean, that's an extra bonus, too, you know.  So she's got a, you mean she's really not a citizen, and she has to deal with all those  things of not being a citizen?  I don't know what she deals with.  She had no problem.  We went to Canada a couple weeks ago and came back.  It was no problem.  I guess she's a semi, I don't know.  Then what?  Then you guys just banged to celebrate?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was great, too.  So, you know, and then we are.  You know, you've got to see this ring. 
[01:26:30]  It's beautiful.  It's so nice.  Can we talk to the unlucky bride-to-be?  What, do you want to say hi?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Bonnie.  Yeah, hold on.  Hello.  Hi, Bonnie.  Hi, Princess.  Hi.  So, how are you feeling today?  Good.  Are you happy about the chain of events here that have taken place?  We heard his side of the story.  Let's hear your side of the story.  Was it a little?  No, yeah.  It was very nice. 
[01:27:00]  It was unexpected.  Was it a little more romantic than Rich just made it out to be?  No, which was perfect because if it had been, I would have.  I'm not.  Oh, you would have.  Oh, okay.  It's too much.  It's gross.  Really?  Yeah.  So, you didn't want to puke or anything?  Yeah, exactly.  You're in love with him and you're getting married.  Yeah, and I knew he was perfect when we were at a radio station and this girl wanted a picture  with him. 
[01:27:30]  And he said, okay, but put your arm around my shoulders.  And the girl did and he goes, okay, now squeeze my neck.  And she did and he farted.  That's fantastic.  Are you going to be, I'm hoping that they have kids.  Yeah.  So Voss could be a, how old is Voss now?  55 or something like that?  Like Tony Randall he'll be.  The doddering old fool with young kids. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  I have a feeling that they're going to have a kid together.  Voss, I think Voss is going to raise another kid.  He's going to get on medication and he's going to be able to get it up and we're going  to make it work.  We're going to make it work.  Is this going to be a Jewish wedding?  No.  No?  He's not going to make you wear a yarmulke or something or him wear the yarmulke?  Doesn't he have a tattoo that says never again?  Isn't that about being a Jew?  I think that was about getting married. 
[01:28:30]  At first I thought it was about no more tattoos.  Oh, never again.  Wow.  So, now you guys, apparently you weren't really surprised so you've talked about this  before?  Oh, yeah.  No, he's, you know.  You didn't force him into this, did you?  Because I know some girls do that.  Now, Voss was talking about this on the golf course a long time ago.  No, I didn't do some other girls and stuff.  I can't get rid of them.  Hey, did you like the earrings he gave you?  He said that you kind of looked a little disappointed when he gave you just the earrings.  Um, no, well, he gave me a little box, so I did think that was, I mean, it looks like 
[01:29:00]  the size of a ring box.  Oh, okay, okay.  Oh, so you thought it was the...  Oh, then when I opened it up, I was, no, the earrings are beautiful.  So you really, uh...  It's really good.  The ring is gorgeous.  The earrings are gorgeous.  How many carats is the ring?  Um, well, Rich loves to talk about the ring, so you should, you should have skills.  Of course.  Yeah, I'm sure he got a great deal on this thing, knowing Rich.  Oh, please.  Jesus, what did he promise the guy?  He told me to tell people it was $7,000. 
[01:29:30]  For low cost.  He did tell me that, too.  Really?  Yeah, of course.  Seven grand.  He told me the night that he called me back.  I don't know the real cost.  $7,000.  He whispers a thousand.  Yeah, someone's on the line, uh, hoping that when Rich handed you the ring, you went,  When the midget handed over the ring to you.  It's a little inside joke on our show.  All right.  Congratulations, Bonnie.  Yeah, congratulations, Bonnie.  Thank you, guys.  Congratulations.  Norton, I hope this doesn't, you know, put a wedge between us. 
[01:30:00]  No, I understand.  It was a long time coming.  He has to for his kids.  He has to keep up appearances, so I'm happy for you.  Appearances.  Well, he can't talk to you anymore.  Do you get along with the...  I'm like the ex.  Bonnie, do you get along with the girls?  What girls?  You know, his grown-up daughters.  His grown-up daughters.  He has daughters.  No, I love them.  They're great.  They're so funny.  Aren't they close to your age?  Yeah, they're just a few years older than me.  A few years older than me. 
[01:30:30]  That's funny.  Ah, Bonnie's very funny.  Yeah, Bonnie brings, uh, brings the funny into this relationship.  He's learning.  All right.  Thank you, Bonnie.  Thank you, Bonnie.  Congratulations to you guys.  Thank you, guys.  Here's Rich again.  All right.  Hello?  We love her.  She's very funny, Rich.  Isn't she?  Yeah.  She is funny.  And, uh, now, when's the date?  Oh, we haven't thought about that yet.  No, huh?  No, I don't know.  When do you do it?  I mean, it'll definitely be on a Sunday. 
[01:31:00]  You know, because this way comics, you know, won't be working.  And who's going to be the best man?  Uh, Norton.  And, well, Norton's going to be made of honor.  He can play both.  Wear something low cut with a wonder bra.  Nice cleavage.  Norton'll be best man.  I'll get Patrice to bartend.  You know, of course.  And if you say you want Anthony and I to DJ, I'll freaking punch you in the face.  There you go, DJ.  Because that's what I get every time someone gets married in my family. 
[01:31:30]  Hey, Hope, you can be the DJ.  I won't make you guys sit in the mouth.  Heard it a million times.  Hey, how about we hire you to be the DJ?  All right.  I get it.  Shut up.  Yeah, so, you know, we've got a lot of planning to do with that because she lives in L.A.  I live here.  Yeah.  Her family's from Canada.  I don't know what to do.  All right.  Who's moving where now?  You've got to live together, right?  We're going to keep two places.  Oh, look at you.  Two places, but where are you going to predominantly live? 
[01:32:00]  In Jersey.  I'm not going to leave my kids.  Oh, boy.  I'm sure she loves that, having some guy that the top priority isn't her.  It's the kids.  Well, some guy last night when we were working the other night, Monday, Valentine's Day, he comes on stage and he asks, you know, the girl to marry him, right?  Yeah.  Which is, I would never do that.  So he sits down.  I go, how long have you been going out with her?  He said, two months, right?  And he has three kids.  So he's going through a divorce and she's just, you know, gaining weight, you know, and codependent. 
[01:32:30]  And it was so creepy, but me and her had been going out a while and we get along great.  You know, I don't know why I told that other boring story.  I thought I'd be able to make a connection, but I couldn't.  It didn't quite work.  It didn't quite work.  That's okay.  We didn't want too much funny with, you know, Bonnie really did a good job.  She was making us laugh and, you know, we didn't want to laugh too much.  That's why she put you back on the phone so quickly, I guess, with that great story.  Hey, dude, I've never been a best man.  I'm nervous.  I don't want to screw that up. 
[01:33:00]  What, being a best man?  Yeah.  How are you going to screw it up?  You just, you know, you hold on to the ring.  You keep it, you know, in your bra or something.  And try not to, during the toast, try not to tell the jerk-off story about the loser gets  to fuck her story.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to come and he smells cat shit in the bathroom and he's going, ah, ah.  The horrified guests looking on.  Jimmy does the worst toast ever.  I don't have any nice stories about Voss.  Yeah, Rich and I have done a lot of gigs together and he's funny. 
[01:33:30]  Cheers.  Best of luck.  All right, well, listen, we've got to get on a plane.  All right.  Congratulations to you guys.  Come in and see you soon, all right?  All right, thanks a lot.  All right, there he goes, Rich Voss.  See you, sweetie.  Going back to newly engaged, California, it looks like.  Rich Voss.  That's going to be a problem where they live, I think.  She's like California, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she would never move back here?  I don't know.  I think they'll find a way because they're both used to it, the travel and stuff.  She's a comic, he's a comic.  Yeah.  But it's not foreign to her or him to have to travel and fly all the time to see each 
[01:34:00]  other.  Yeah.  They don't see each other much, it seems.  Every time you talk to Rich, she's flying in from somewhere.  No, they're in love, though, man.  Voss was telling me all about her on the golf course a year ago.  Yeah.  He was telling me, I'm going to marry this one.  Before or after he made out with the old broad?  Oh.  The grandma.  I love her so much.  Come here, granny.  I think that was before Bonnie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was.  No, it was before Bonnie.  He's actually been faithful to Bonnie.  And I'm not listening right now, he doesn't have an XM portable. 
[01:34:30]  He has been totally faithful to her.  He really is in love.  It makes me sick.  He's really happy.  Nothing wrong with that.  Took you out of the mix, though, right?  You two were like bosom buddies.  I was riding his kid.  Every time he'd get laid, I'd get to jack off and watch.  You know how awful this is for me?  Could selfish Voss think of me?  Ah, that bastard.  I'm lonely.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break, Anthony?  We'll continue.  Uh-huh.  In honor of Rich and Bonnie.  Yeah.  Getting married.  Yeah.  We'll play this. 
[01:35:00]  You're getting married.  No, no.  Here's Anthony from the Oakley & Anthony Show to help you plan the perfect wedding.  I'm talking to you.  Are you listening?  First, you must carefully choose a wedding ring for your gal.  I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station, and I think I spent, um, 300 bucks on it.  Right.  Well, you should also make sure your betrothed gets along with your dear, sweet mother.  Your son is a scumbag. 
[01:35:30]  Eh, maybe not.  Your wedding night, on the other hand, should be a magical one.  I believe, uh, I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of regret and sorrow rolling down the sides of my face.  Just follow the simple steps, and you'll have the perfect wedding.  Just like...  Eh, I got nothing.  I was shocked.  I was horrified.  I was broke.  Hopeless. 
[01:36:00]  What did I get myself into?  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave.  Never marry a lot!  I was a broken, beaten man.  And I had been married for six hours.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into, uh...  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know, um... 
[01:36:30]  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages...  Savages!  ...that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch it, this.  You want to taste this?  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Wow, that's really nice.  What, what, what?  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not down against the divas.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva. 
[01:37:00]  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  God forbid they should put a few radio stations anywhere between here and Salt Lake.  City, for God's sake.  You hit your scam button.  It's like playing roulette without the ball.  It just spins and spins.  Get a choice of static or national public radio.  Let me flip a fucking coin. 
[01:37:30]  Ugh.  We're now listening to national public radio.  And I'll go live to Liechtenstein for a concert from a cafe where  Jans Choskohanovanovanovanovitz is playing the dulcimer strung only with scrotum hair.  This is national public radio.  Don't fall asleep at the wheel.  I blew a speaker in my car today.  That sucked. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, he was a motivational speaker.  Left a bad taste in my mouth, but I feel a lot more positive.  It's the weirdest thing.  I am.  Oh, my gracious.  You know what I hate?  The one thing I hated growing up more than anything else, I hated being tickled.  Tickling is the worst.  Because it started off fun. 
[01:38:30]  Right?  Tickling started.  Tickling.  Let's tickle.  Started fun.  Ended horribly.  Didn't it always escalate the same way?  At first, you'd be like, I can't breathe.  I can't breathe.  Cut it out.  Stop it.  I'm going to throw up.  And they couldn't stop.  They were like, I don't care.  I had to punch my grandmother in the chest to get her off me. 
[01:39:00]  I had to punch my grandmother in the chest to get her off me. 
[01:39:30]  I've got some instant feedback, Sophie.  Does Voss's friend run a jewelry store at Penn Station?  And did Voss propose on Valentine's Day or Swallow's Day?  I always get those two confused.  Very funny.  A little inside joke.  And then a quarter carat apiece for the earrings.  I'm unemployed and got my fiance a five-carat tennis bracelet for Valentine's Day. 
[01:40:00]  And how cheap is Voss?  He got engaged on Valentine's Day to save on the gift.  Yeah.  The old engaged on a holiday.  Christmas.  Valentine's Day.  Birthday.  Very thrifty.  Carol from Wisconsin.  Voss has the romantic charm of Robert Blake.  And JG from Jersey.  Voss owes his friend two grand for the engagement ring and he's dodging them.  I'm sure they'll be very happy. 
[01:40:30]  I can't imagine getting married a second time.  Can't even fathom it.  And you're having to shovel over more cash if something doesn't work out like that?  Yeah, but you're in a good relationship now.  That's exactly it.  Might be time.  I'm in a fine relationship.  A little prenup action.  Great relationship.  Fantastic.  And I am not ruining it with wedding vows.  Stupidly.  Yeah, this is great.  You know what we really need?  A legal binding contract to say that it's great.  To say how much in love we are. 
[01:41:00]  That's it.  Have some guy draw up a contract that we can sign that'll hold somebody legally, financially binding if this thing falls apart.  Yeah, that's a great idea.  Marriage.  Stop it.  Never again.  Tattoo that on my arm, too.  Never again.  I'm thinking maybe someday.  Nope.  It ain't gonna happen.  I'm thinking maybe someday.  Really?  Yeah, why not?  Ain't gonna happen.  Give it a shot.  I'm not getting married. 
[01:41:30]  Why?  Because I want to have kids?  You still do that.  Oh, you?  Yeah, I'm thinking someday, maybe.  Talk about Tony Randall.  I don't think you would actually get married for quite a while.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, you like the whole, I think you like the whole idea of it.  I know you want to have kids and stuff like that, but I don't know.  It just doesn't seem, it seems like you're the kind of guy that would just keep putting  it off, keep putting it off, keep putting it off until you're like, I think I want to 
[01:42:00]  get married.  I'm thinking someday.  You think after the whole radio thing?  I don't know.  So if you don't have to deal with this crap anymore?  I mean, I was in a long-term relationship and that broke up, so.  But I'm thinking someday.  Yeah.  Someday I might have another shot at it.  Sure, why not?  Another shot?  Another shot?  Keith Robinson's here.  What is he listening to?  His music.  What was that old TV show where they had the big headphones on? 
[01:42:30]  Tattletales or?  Tattletales.  No, what was it?  It was Tattletales.  It was Tattletales?  Yeah.  It was like celebrities that would sit at their little, there were three of them, three  little podium things they would sit at.  And then there was a TV screen where their wife would be on in a soundproof room and they'd  be wearing the big goofy headphones so they couldn't hear the questions.  Yeah.  Wasn't that the, what was the marriage one, right?  Yeah.  That was it?  No, it wasn't the Newly Way game.  It was called Tattletales.  It was Tattletales with Burt Convy.  And they would show like, they'd show the spouses all listening to music while they talked 
[01:43:00]  to their, you know, their significant other.  It was always Steve Garvey and his wife and Bill Shatner and his, uh, his scuba-neating  wife.  Did they show her with the headphones on or a mask and snorkel?  That would have been great.  Have her on the TV.  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Shut up on it.  If your wife is at the bottom of the pool, do you call 9-1-1 immediately or mow the lawn  and then call the other?  Bill Shatner, your answer.  Let's clean up this wedding talk before we move on to the gates again. 
[01:43:30]  Uh, Jim in Illinois, what's up?  Hey, hey, uh, this is for, uh, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, I got an idea.  We, there was, I was at a wedding, my best, one of my best friend's wedding and the best  man, when it came time for him to give it, give the ring to the grooms, uh, they were,  they had their wedding around a, uh, a lake and he goes, I can't let you do this, man.  And he throws the wedding box in the lake.  The wedding box?  And it's like, the, the, the, the bride's tears dried up like that. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, she was like, he sighed herself, like, what the, and nobody knew about the preacher  and the best man.  That's the only two people that knew in the whole wedding.  It was hilarious.  Then he finally gave him the, the real ring, but.  Oh, the ring.  Oh, it was a gag.  I gotcha.  So the ring was actually in his pocket or whatever?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's kind of cool, though.  Yeah.  Because I'm really bored with the whole wedding thing.  Yeah.  As far as going to them, they're the same crap.  They're so cookie cutter.  The same crap.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  There's no real creativity as far as, uh, the weddings you go to. 
[01:44:30]  The goofy DJs that just do the same crap.  Oh, they play the same dopey songs, make the same, do the dopey dances and everything.  Ugh.  Chicken dance.  I just sit at weddings.  I hate weddings.  And I just sit there and, and drink my drink and watch and just go, oh, look at this.  Oh, again, they're doing this.  The New York, New York with the kick line.  Oh, here's the conga line. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, they bring out props.  Some of these DJs, the inflatable saxophone.  And they'll play a song and the inflatable guitar and, and, uh, the, the whole bride groom  or the, the, the wedding party gets out there and jams with the, enough already.  God, stop it.  Nothing original going on with those things.  I'll tell you the most fun I have at a wedding is just to watch the old people dancing and having fun.  Just hoping one of them dies on the dance floor. 
[01:45:30]  All you see is them, they make some kind of a face and then they just go head first into the cake and spoil it for everyone.  Your wedding is forever marred by the death of that selfish loved one.  Your anniversary is just ruined.  Yeah, you got to go to the, go to the grave with flowers and then kiss your wife on the cheek.  You deserve it, stupid.  You're making a good point, though, because every wedding I go to, you see the, the older gentleman, uh, hitting the dance floor with their, quote, young bride.  A little too vigorous, like they're a little too vigorous, yeah, and you'll, and you're hoping the DJ's going to slow down the music 
[01:46:00]  because you see his face getting red and breathing a little heavy.  You're like, uh-oh, is this the wedding that, uh, it finally turns tragic?  You're going to ruin this wedding for everybody.  Yeah, just some uncle or grandparent that would just, you know, just, like they'd all be trying to have fun and the paramedics have to come in.  Oh, God.  How perfect would that be?  Let's, uh, say hi to CJ in Florida.  CJ.  What's up, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi, CJ.  Good morning.  Good morning, Cupcake.  How are you?  I'm good, CJ.  Um, Jimmy, as the best man, I wanted to know if you had any, uh, terrific plans for the, uh, bachelor party there. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, that's right.  That is the best man's responsibility, Jimmy.  Oh.  You've got to plan the bachelor party.  Uh, well, I guess I could find some transgendered friends.  That's the type of bachelor party I saw, Voss.  Oh, God.  He played Voss?  I know Voss.  He's not big on strip clubs or lap dances.  Rich is a weird guy.  He'd be happy just to go out to eat with a bunch of friends.  He would want to go play golf.  Yeah, or something like that.  He'd want to do something awful, which is fine.  Yeah.  I don't want to do anything dirty.  Yeah.  It would be a boring bachelor party, probably. 
[01:47:00]  Just a bunch of us eating.  Eating and maybe playing golf or something.  We'd sit in the smoking section.  Because Voss smokes.  Those, um, those sex type bachelor parties are the worst.  I went to a couple, uh, a couple of these things that were, um, at, at people's houses and stuff.  And, uh, the hooker arrives with the big, like, Dago Wop guy that's got to protect her.  Yeah, the driver.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey, don't touch the girl.  Don't do the, you know, unless there's enough money, uh, going around.  And then guys will go in the room and get the head and, and they have wives or girlfriends. 
[01:47:30]  And it's just a, it's a, it's not even a fun scene to be in.  You know, it's just like.  It's like creepy dirty.  It's creepy.  It's these little secrets going on.  The girls are just skanky.  Like, really.  You're talking skanky.  It's Long Island hookers, you know, that come to these, uh, Long Island bachelor parties.  Awful girls.  One did a pretty good dildo act, though, once.  It was, uh, she was using this dildo. 
[01:48:00]  It was, it was called the, I remember it was called the Anal Destroyer.  Dude, it was the biggest dildo I've ever seen in my life.  It looked like a, it looked like one of those shells you blowed into a howitzer.  It was like that big around.  Hence the Anal Destroyer name.  Destroyer.  Not intruder.  The Anal Destroyer.  It was, yeah.  Not the interrupter or the slight damager. 
[01:48:30]  Destroyer.  You open the box, her uncle jumps out.  And she went at it.  Right when she took this thing out of the bag, the other girl, uh, everyone was just going,  there is no way she was going to be able to use that.  And she did.  So that was like the most entertainment I ever had at a bachelor party.  How, how, I mean, how did she use it?  Uh, it was the Anal Destroyer, so she, did she put it, uh, a helper?  Not a loop.  She had a girl helping her and slowly, like, pushed it, uh, into the back door. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, you know, we're freaks because we like to see stuff like that.  Yeah.  Then we'll, uh, give a standing ovation.  Yeah.  We're just standing by, like, oof.  And then I get all freaked out, like I can't touch anything until I wash up.  Really?  Yeah, because just the thought of, like, because I know other people were touching the girls,  and then they're, like, grabbing beer, and then maybe getting, giving me a beer.  So I'm, I know the beer can I'm holding was in his hand, and his hand was on the chick, 
[01:49:30]  and, yeah, I'm a little weird like that.  I used to do a gig, I forgot, until you said the bachelor party, I remembered.  Me and Florentine, it was, like, in Pennsylvania, right when you go over the border.  And I, this guy loved me, and he would have these parties for guys, maybe he would just  hire hookers.  And I would just do the comedy for 15 to 20 minutes, and then just go into a stall  and get blown for 40 or 50 bucks.  Wow.  It was a great gig, and I'm glad you reminded me of it.  I don't know how I screwed that one up.  Great gig.  Hey, we must go to the phones here.  John.  Yo.  Morning, boys. 
[01:50:00]  Hold on.  What was your wedding song before you tell your little story?  Oh, actually, I wasn't, it wasn't my wedding.  I'm actually one of those guys you're talking about.  I'm a wedding DJ occasionally.  Okay.  What song was playing?  I honestly couldn't tell you.  All right.  I don't know.  I'm sure it was a very lovely love song, perhaps.  Oh, I'm sure.  You know, it was a big one.  It was amazing or something just awful like that.  What year was this, sir?  This was two years ago.  Two years ago?  What was the big wedding song of two years ago?  Some sappy.  Oh, my gosh. 
[01:50:30]  They go with the Celine Dion all the time.  They go with Shania Twain.  All right.  Which Celine Dion song?  Help us out here, John.  Oh, my gosh.  You know, I'll give you the Shania.  How about Still the One I Love?  Ugh.  Yeah.  Just wretched.  Yeah.  Wait, Shania?  Yeah, Shania Twain.  All right, because Derek has all the Celine Dion songs and Dillette ready to go, and now  he has to go to Shania.  Shania.  Very nice.  That Still the One I Love is atrocious.  You know the song?  You're still the one I love. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, that one.  It stinks.  Oh, wow.  That's a good rendition.  Yeah, I mean, I'm a little rusty.  I haven't sang in a while.  Can he find it?  Oh, he's got it?  He's got it?  He's good.  No?  One minute?  One moment?  Wow.  He's usually really quick.  No, he was ready with the Celine Dion.  Yeah, but if you throw him a curveball, he should be able to just nail it.  He's a little slow today.  There's something going on.  You think it's the computer?  No, I think it's John's fault.  Now, fans looking over his shoulder like he can fix the problem. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Sit down.  Now they're just pointing at the screen, giggling at each other.  There it is, right?  There it is.  This song, John.  All right.  All right.  So what happened at the wedding you were DJing at?  A couple days.  At the wedding I'm DJing at, a lot of older relatives were there.  And all of a sudden, this is just after dinner.  They're just about to start dancing and everything.  The groom's great aunt, who's like a million years old, just collapses. 
[01:52:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  And in about five, ten minutes, the ambulance is there.  They wheel her out.  They've got the oxygen hooked up to her and everything.  And she had a respiratory problem.  We found out later that evening that she had died.  That will ruin the wedding forever. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Try to keep a rod on your honeymoon.  All you think is that fat pig collapsing in the corner, being hauled out.  As they wheeled her out, everybody's like, oh, how terrible.  And then ten minutes later, everybody's up and dancing again.  Dancing again?  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, I'm playing it by ear, keeping it soft for a little while,  and then the bride comes up.  She's like, let's get everybody going.  Oh, she didn't care.  It wasn't part of our family, right?  Even the wedding pictures are ruined because even though the woman isn't in them, 
[01:53:00]  you can kind of see off to the side the glare of the ambulance red light in the lens.  She's actually in the photo.  She's laying on the floor with one shoe off.  You know, I'd like to toast the beautiful couple here today.  You know, I knew these guys.  You got that, right?  And, you know, let's all raise our glass. 
[01:53:30]  Where am I?  A weather in London?  Where am I?  That says fire truck, you ass.  Damn limeys.  Damn limey wedding.  And I just wish them all the best.  As a horse rides through the reception.  Why don't I just...  I would like to propose... 
[01:54:00]  No, that's what's going to be heard when Norton's doing his speech.  Someone said his speech is going to be,  Yeah, one time me and Rich hung out and saw this girl and I said,  Rich, she's hot.  And he went, yeah.  All right, let's take another one.  Jay in Jersey.  What song was playing before you tell the story?  Honestly, boys, it was actually in the church, which kind of made it even much worse.  All right, hold on. 
[01:54:30]  Do we have any church music, maybe?  Church organ music?  I used to have that Ave Maria.  They play that, too, in the church.  Ave Maria.  I had that Gregorian chant CD.  Really?  I'll do this, maybe.  Let's see.  Yeah?  Yeah, okay.  Is there any real one, though?  Yeah, I got a good one.  Yeah?  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try. 
[01:55:00]  That's do you think I'm sexy?  That's not serious.  He sits alone, waiting for suggestions.  He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions.  His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding.  Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking? 
[01:55:30]  If you want my body, and you think I'm sexy, come on, children, let me know.  The theme song for the Catholic priest.  This is Father Shanley's music.  Jesus.  Derek, do you have something better than that?  Maybe.  Oh, he's working on it.  He's grabbing something for you, buddy.  There's some control in there, isn't it? 
[01:56:00]  Isn't that great?  All right, well, Jay?  Yo.  Jay from Jersey, why don't you tell you a little story?  No problem, boys.  I'm a medic in the city.  A couple years ago in Queens, we had called for a church.  During the wedding ceremony, while the bride and the room were up on the altar, the bride's  father collapsed and died.  We get there, we start working him up, and the bride starts yelling at her father.  Please, please, you have to survive, because you have to see Jimmy Norton at the Houston  Improv.  What an ass! 
[01:56:30]  That is great!  I hate you all.  That was a good one.  You have to survive.  You have to see Jimmy Norton.  I hate Norton and all his friends.  Oh, damn, that is a good one.  He got me.  I get gotten every day with that.  So did I.  Believe it.  Can we make a rule that we only do like 10 a day, please?  Oh, that was perfect.  That was perfect.  You've got to give it to me. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  But it's so weird that she would say that to her dad.  I mean, I guess that that was important to her.  I know, you know, people handle stress and sadness in their own way, and her to blurt  out, you know, your plug.  Yeah, but the Houston Improv, I mean, but I guess that was what she wanted her father  to live for.  Right, right.  All right, why don't we say hi to Derek.  Derek?  Hello?  Derek.  Hey, what's going on?  Hi, man.  What's the wrong with you?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jesus.  Oh, he held on and left. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  Where'd you go, sweetie?  Tom from Long Island.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Great to have you back.  Oh, thanks, Tom.  I'm at a wedding in Rocky Point, I don't know, about eight years ago.  What song was playing?  Hold on.  What song was playing?  It's a lot better when the music's playing.  Oh, God.  It was eight years ago, man.  I don't know.  Hit me with your best shot?  Eight years?  That was a long time ago.  Eight years.  We could almost figure that out.  It's like 1997-ish.  97?  Trying to think of...  Yeah, probably around there. 
[01:58:00]  Hit me with your best shot.  All right.  So it was Jose Canseco's wedding?  Maybe that Brian Adams song.  Which Brian Adams?  That's older than that, but people are still using it.  Oh, Brian Adams?  Yeah.  Everything I Do.  Everything I Do.  You know what that might have been that wedding song?  I Do For Love.  All right.  Let's try it.  Everything I Do, I Do It For You.  I Do It For You.  Yeah, one of those.  All right.  Here it is.  That's a good song.  Thank you, Dick Wedding.  Derek was quick on that one.  Go ahead, Tom.  All right.  So we're in the reception, and one of the bridesmaids gets in a fight with her husband. 
[01:58:30]  He punches her dead in the face.  The videographer catches the whole thing.  The guy freaks out, smashes the camera, beats up the videographer, and is taken out of  the wedding in handcuffs.  Sonny Corleone.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  God damn bridesmaids don't respect nothing.  Wow.  A fight at the wedding.  That says Long Island.  My friend was actually back.  Fucking out, guys.  My friend Barry did videos for a living.  I remember years ago hearing this. 
[01:59:00]  He said he was videotaping in the church, and the best man and groom at this fight, actually  in this ceremony in the church.  It's many years ago, but I remember hearing that.  He probably saw a lot of those great things.  Later on at the reception, I heard, because I know that wedding you're talking about, I  heard that what happened was the groom told everyone to flip their plates over, and on  the bottom was a photograph of the best man and the bride having sex.  Oh, because the one I heard...  But it really happened.  The one I heard, there was a picture of some guy who took a picture of his Levitre heart 
[01:59:30]  on and showed all his friends.  That's what I'm going to put under the plates at Voss's wedding, his Levitre heart on photo.  Oh, my God.  You should do that.  You should do that.  If he didn't have kids, I would really be very happy to do that.  But no, the thing is actually a true story.  It's not an urban legend.  My friend actually shot that, yeah.  Yeah, we tried to do this a long time ago.  Thanks, Eric.  Hit the floor and then the elevator.  Thanks for reminding us.  I heard they were on their honeymoon also, and tragic, their hotel room got robbed, and they 
[02:00:00]  stole every bit of their possessions, except they left their camera and their toothbrushes,  which they found was a little odd.  But at least that was a couple of things that they had still.  They went back home, sent the film off to be delivered, and went about their life.  And then when they got the pictures back, they were going through the pictures, and what  did they see?  The guys that robbed them with their toothbrushes, pictures of them, the guys that robbed them  with their toothbrushes shoved in their asses.  So they had been brushing their teeth with the toothbrushes that the guys had put in their 
[02:00:30]  ass.  See, that's not an urban legend.  That happened to me, and it was my own toothbrush in my own ass.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  You just snapped a few off?  Yeah, but I did it on purpose.  I wasn't even pretending I was robbed.  You know what was odd?  There was another picture, because they had gone into the bathroom.  It was Bob Kelly fucking the sink in their hotel room.  Let's see on Anthony on Long Island.  Anthony.  How you doing?  Good.  What was the song playing? 
[02:01:00]  I believe it was Fly Me to the Moon by Frank Sinatra.  Seriously?  Fly Me to the Moon.  All right, hold on.  That's it.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Give Derek a couple seconds here.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Derek.  Jesus.  Calm down.  Gets the chairman of the board on there real quick.  Nice.  All right, go ahead, Anthony.  Tell you a little story.  All right, well, I work EMS in a city near a city, and I was at a wedding where pretty  much everybody knew me.  During the cocktail hour that song was playing, one of the cocktail waitresses has a grand  malsicia, lands on top of the table, food goes all over the place, and across the 
[02:01:30]  room you hear, Anthony, screaming for me.  Oh!  I'm running over.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Well, what happened?  I'm off.  That's the last thing I want to do.  Well, they got a cool ambulance.  The ambulance came in and left you at the Westbury Manor.  Ranchers had a seizure.  No, grandma's seizure.  But did she live, or did she put a wallet in her mouth?  What did you do?  No, no.  She lived.  She lived.  Don't put anything in the mouth when they have a seizure.  That's all white now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But, you know, I might tell you, I'm about to go and do what I usually do for a living, you know? 
[02:02:00]  Well, thank you, Anthony.  Thank God it all worked out.  Let's go to Infected Curtis from Wackbag.com.  Go ahead, Infected Curtis.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi.  Well, basically, I had a friend who I grew up with, and he was a big football player,  and they were all out in Chicago for a fellow teammate's wedding,  and these kids were like 6'6", large gentlemen, two of them.  They must have picked up some bad shit on the street because they kind of ruined the wedding. 
[02:02:30]  Two of them were found face down in their hotel room, like a car crash, maybe?  Well, what happened?  He's begging for the car crash to get out of this.  Did you hear how nervous he was?  Car crash, maybe?  I guess they must have snorted like Comet.  I don't know.  They just picked up some shit off a dark cellar in a taxi out in Chicago, a place they didn't know anything.  They didn't know anybody.  But two of them, I mean, like 200-pound kids, just face down, dead. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, they died?  Yeah, the night before the wedding, after the bachelor party.  I guess everyone, you know, was calling their night.  These guys were on their way back to the hotel, and, you know, a little this, a little that,  and they were found face down, blue.  Well, where did they get the drugs from?  People they knew?  No, no, no.  They were out in Chicago, like just from random taxi driver acts.  Oh, good.  So what happened?  They both, either one of them made the wedding, or were they sick?  Uh, no.  Neither one of them made the wedding because they both died. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, that stinks.  They're both big guys, and they probably just bought bad stuff, like bad dope.  Exactly.  I mean, these kids kind of knew what they were doing.  I mean, they did a lot of drugs, you know?  Did they catch who gave them the drugs?  No, nothing ever happened about it.  I mean, just kind of like a, just a black mark on that hotel.  It was a little write-up in the paper, and kind of ruined the wedding the next day.  I mean, these kids were in the wedding, too, both of them.  Both of them in the wedding, so they both died, and you don't know where they got the drugs from.  Nobody knows.  Right.  Big guys, right?  Well, I had a rumor that they got him in Houston at the Improv, 24 to 26, 713, 333, 8800. 
[02:04:00]  He's trying everything, man.  He's trying everything.  He's trying everything.  All right, there, pally.  All right, well, thanks for wrecking the bit.  We greatly appreciate it.  We could have rode that bit for another half hour, but you killed it.  I said, sent the film to be delivered?  People point out everything.  Vinny O'Shea, terrific, from Port Jeff, is saying, hey, Ann, sent the film to be delivered?  I meant developed.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's just a little slip of the tongue. 
[02:04:30]  A little slip of the tongue.  All right, a little Stephen Lynch as we go to break.  When Grandfather dies, life will be strange.  When Grandfather dies, my whole world will change.  When Grandfather dies, I'll scream and I'll yell.  Cause I'll be f***ing rich as hell.  So Grandfather die, don't keep me in suspense.  So Grandfather cough of that inheritance. 
[02:05:00]  So Grandfather don't hold on another day.  I love you to death, but I've got bills to pay.  A stroke would be nice.  Disease would be cool.  I'll scatter his ashes in my new swimming pool.  I'll party with Hef.  I'll dine with the Queen.  So what say we unplug that machine?  Oh Grandfather die, before the fiscal year. 
[02:05:30]  Oh Grandfather I, wish Kevorkian were here.  Oh Grandfather fly, just take your final vow.  Oh Grandfather die, family hates you anyhow.  For God's sakes you must be as old as the sun.  Your social security number is one.  You're deaf, dumb, and blind, and an amputee.  You donate your blood every time that you pee.  Your arthritis acts up whenever it rains. 
[02:06:00]  You're so old, your penis has varicose veins.  Why don't you die, Grandpa?  Why must you fight?  You old mother f***er.  Just walk toward the goddamn light.  Walk toward the light, old man.  Walk toward the light, old man. 
[02:06:30]  It's all over now.  My granddad is dead.  A mysterious blow to his wrinkled old head.  Before I collect a small oversight.  But everything should work out all right.  I'll start working on my grandma tonight.  I just love a drive in the country, laughing with Opie and Anthony.

I know.  Now that tough crowd is canceled, they're all coming our way. 
[02:10:00]  I saw Colin last night on TV.  I was watching him on the Celebrity Poker on Bravo.  And he actually won.  He won the whole thing last night.  Table of six, I guess.  And he was playing some of the worst poker I've ever seen anyone play.  The guy would not lay down a hand.  He would not fold for nothing.  He was playing like 8-3 offsuit against Ace King. 
[02:10:30]  And he would win.  The flop would come out and give him two pair.  And he's betting like a madman on the crappiest hands.  And the last card flips over.  And it's one of his goddamn cards.  And he just kept eliminating people left and right.  Playing like a complete idiot.  And he wins the whole thing.  And they said they couldn't figure out what he was doing, if he was bluffing or not.  They said because he always just has this miserable look on his face.  And they couldn't tell if he had a good hand, a bad hand. 
[02:11:00]  Because he's just always got that face like he's smelling something bad constantly.  And he's the only one.  I've been watching that show for a while.  And everybody, all the celebrities that show up there, they must tell them, yeah, well, there's going to be a camera on your hands.  Because, you know, you're looking at your cards.  And everyone's perfectly manicured.  They've got these beautiful nails.  Colin picks up his cards once.  The camera goes right on his fingers. 
[02:11:30]  Because I swear to God, the homeless guy that I pass every morning, his hand wrapped around his gin bottle had better nails on it than Colin's last night.  Cuticles all ripped up.  Dirt under his fingernails.  They were all chipped up.  What the hell is that Irishman doing?  He's finished.  That's what he's doing.  After tough crowd, he ought to get a gig loading ships at the dock.  Yeah, he is.  This goddamn guy is a mess.  He is a mess.  He'll be fighting screeching and celebrity boxing next week. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, man.  He is finished.  God damn.  He had a great run.  He had a great run.  Hey, are you ready for next week, Anthony?  I am ready.  We're going to L.A.  Anthony's doing the poker thing next week at the World Poker Tour.  The World Poker Tour in L.A. next week.  We're broadcasting live.  What?  Invitational.  Wednesday and Thursday?  Yep, Wednesday, Thursday.  I'm in the Invitational.  Celebrity and Poker Superstar is going to be playing, and I'm in it.  Are you practicing?  I've been practicing every night. 
[02:12:30]  I'm online, gambling away.  It takes a lot of patience to play that game.  It does take a lot of patience.  I don't have that patience.  I'm sitting there because I want to do stuff.  I want to talk.  I want to yap.  I'm the worst bluffer ever.  Because as soon as I get a good hand, yeah, I bet everything.  I'm the worst.  It is a game of patience, man.  It's one of those things where you spend a lot of time folding.  If you have bad hands time after time, you just fold the goddamn things.  You start thinking after you fold to eight, ten consecutive hands, you're going, maybe I'll 
[02:13:00]  play this one because you just want to get into it.  But you've got to be very disciplined and stuff, and that's like last night watching Colin.  It was hysterical.  The guy is playing crap just to play.  And then someone will come on top of him and go, you know, raise him like thousands of  dollars.  And he just makes his face like, why not?  Slides his money in.  He's got crap.  And then that last card flips.  Boom.  It's his.  It's the card he needed. 
[02:13:30]  We need to get him on the phone.  Oh, it was hysterical.  He could give you some advice for next week.  If I play like him, I'd be out in a second.  Believe me.  Do you have your gimmick yet?  I don't have a gimmick.  We need a gimmick for him.  I don't have a gimmick where I'm going to wear like the, I'll wear the spring on the  eyes and the, what am I going to do?  Wear a beanie with a propeller on it?  How about Colin's gimmick of Abe's hands?  Maybe that was his gimmick.  I didn't even figure that out.  But he can't tell what he's saying.  You know, he's saying a hole, but he's got to keep it.  Give him a card. 
[02:14:00]  Give him a card.  Dumbling, muttering.  Dumbling, that idiot.  The guy was probably telling everyone what his hand was.  I would have told him.  Two, seven.  Hold.  Hold.  He's on his hold.  I guess I'll play, you know.  You know, President Bush, you know, he's still doing some.  I'm staying here, stupid.  I love him. 
[02:14:30]  Love him.  But, yeah, he won the whole thing.  But I'm very, I think my strategy is going to be really sit back and really wait for the  good hands.  That seems to work.  I've been playing in a lot of the table games online.  Not the cash games either, like the ones where you pay a fee to get in, get the chips that  aren't real money.  It's just chips.  And then you see how long you last.  And I made it.  I won quite a few.  And I'm in the money most of the time.  Well, there's professional poker players. 
[02:15:00]  How do you know?  Like, if you enter the room, can you figure out who the professional is?  Like, you walk in.  The guy with the big stack of chips in front of him.  I don't know if these sons of bitches are like fucking Kreskin.  They know exactly what you're doing.  These guys will know if you're trying to put one over on them.  They'll know if you have a good hand.  And they fold out of nowhere.  I've seen guys.  Like, last night, I came up on a hand where the flop comes out.  All the cards are out on the table now.  And there's a chance that someone could have a flush. 
[02:15:30]  I have three aces.  No way I'm laying that down.  And the guy hits me with a big bet.  So I'm thinking, he's probably got the flush, but I don't have the discipline to throw down  three aces.  So I saw it.  Boom.  He turns up his flush.  I'm out, you know.  I blew it.  But these guys know, they can sense this shit, that that flush is there.  The way the guy's betting, the way he bet from the first card that came out, they know  that that flush was there.  I wonder, was that Texas holding that they were playing back in the old western movies 
[02:16:00]  where they had the pistols, you know, and the guys would cheat?  Was that Texas holding that?  Apparently not.  It was just stud.  Five-part stud or something.  No numbers on them.  You have to count the shit.  Like, five parts.  No.  Because everybody cheated back then, so I didn't know.  No one played Hold'em, except for the pros.  Up until recently, no one ever heard of friggin' Hold'em.  Everyone, let me get together with your buddies.  What are you playing?  Seven cards stud.  No offense nigger in the woodpile.  Come up with these dopey ass games.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[02:16:30]  No offense nigger in the woodpile.  Hey, none taken.  You know what the hell, Anthony?  It was a game, huh?  You could have paused that for the no offense, man.  I didn't really mean it.  You should have just said it.  Yeah, don't give me the no offense just to cut so you could say it.  And see what kind of reaction you could have.  And then you could have moved forward a little more gingerly.  Jesus.  You should have said, no offense, stupid nigger in the woodpile.  I'll just slip this one right back. 
[02:17:00]  You play your dopey games with your friends, but no one ever heard of the Hold'em Up until  all this crap on TV.  Since it's been on TV, Fat Bob Kelly is trying to start these gambling tournaments.  Oh, is he?  Because he's such an empty addict.  He has nothing.  Oh, what an idiot.  And he wants to invite couples over for meals.  What a lonely jackass.  Couples over for meals?  Yeah, he wants, hey, I'll get another couple to come over.  So he's trying to fill up his stupid, empty life.  That fat idiot.  That poor bastard.  He really, oh, he annoys me.  Sorry, sink fucking son of a bitch.  I'm going to see prostitutes for the rest of my damn life. 
[02:17:30]  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm never going to stop seeing prostitutes.  I'm going to be happy.  I send a prostitute chocolates and flowers for Valentine's Day.  I love them.  They're the only women I ever will love.  And he seems to have a problem with that.  He has a problem.  He wants to stop all, you know, because he thinks his karma is bad.  That's all he's doing anything for, that idiot.  He seems to be very spiritual.  Well, that's not going to help your career, Bob.  It's not going to help, stupid. 
[02:18:00]  I was under the impression it was just another schlep comic that didn't care how many hookers they screw with.  No.  But this guy really had this problem.  He came in here and talked about how he wants to get his life together, get a girlfriend, be in a real relationship.  But he's got these demons that he can't seem to get out of his mind.  We all have them.  And they don't go away, stupid.  They don't just go away with proper eating diet.  He thinks if he eats right, his whore fetish will go away.  I have more respect for the guys that embrace it, understand what it is, and just live with it. 
[02:18:30]  I embrace it.  I borrow money from women just to buy prostitutes.  He really is filth.  You guys are all from the same mold.  It's just amazing.  I know they're just...  Keith Robertson, Jim Norton, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss.  We've got some news about Rich Voss.  Have you heard yet?  That idiot.  You heard?  I want to see him try to find a ring for that small finger on his head.  Little baby hair.  Voss called in to tell us that he got engaged.  Oh, what a...  Valentine's Day. 
[02:19:00]  Even though he's claiming it wasn't Valentine's Day because it was two in the morning.  Oh, he got that Valentine's Day.  2 a.m. at a Best Western after eating at a diner.  Oh, at a diner.  No joke.  He ate at a diner, then went to a Best Western, and then proposed at, what, two in the morning.  Yeah.  At a Best Western hotel?  Yeah, because they had to fly the next morning.  So he picked Bonnie up at the airport.  They went to a diner, and then the Best Western.  So it was like an airport hotel, basically, right?  Yeah.  Fucking Ted Bundy proposed at a Best Western. 
[02:19:30]  One of those bad wood-paneled rooms.  It was actually the place where Henry Lee Lucas committed that last murder.  He had a suitcase with a cadaver in it.  Room next door, the pilot's banging some stewardess, and there's Voss proposing.  And it's going to make me happy when she takes all his little Last Comic Standard money,  because she can use that as an excuse for the propositor at a Best Western.  When she dumps his dumb ass.  Oh, two-time loser, Voss.  It would be really sad to be around.  Really sad.  Oh, boy. 
[02:20:00]  My wife, my ex-wife.  My ex-wife, she left me.  I don't know why.  She said something about a Best Western.  Best Western.  That's his honeymoon.  The Best Western sweets.  Hopping to their twin beds when they're done.  And right in front of her, he's bragging that he got a good deal in the ring.  Oh, yeah.  He's just a man.  Really busting apart those Jewish stereotypes.  Yeah, I got a bargain on the ring.  His friend was going to get married.  Voss' friend was going to get married, and Voss actually bought the ring from this guy, 
[02:20:30]  because it didn't work out.  Get out!  That's when he got the ring.  That's why he said the ring box had chips in it, because the guy he got it from was going  to get married, and I guess decided not to.  And threw it on the floor.  Oh, my God.  Threw it on the pavement.  That's not like a bad sign.  Or maybe the girl threw it down on the pavement after this guy gave it to her.  Voss is the kind of Jew that in 1941 would have actually took gold fillings out of other  people's teeth and made a ring out of it.  He really is scum.  Never again will we waste so much gold.  Got in a box of chocolates from a local drugstore. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Tried to hide the ring and went, oh, idiot.  Yeah, the little box of chocolates in the Red Heart from the pharmacy.  That last-ditch effort when you forgot on your way home that it was Valentine's Day.  What's that awful brand?  Brax.  Brax.  Brax chocolate.  Brax chocolate.  The awful stale chocolates in there.  Yeah, that really says, I love you.  He's a fool.  He is a fool.  No one shows up at his wedding.  None of his friends.  We all just told him we're too busy. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, Megan, I got gigs.  What are you going to do?  He said he's doing it on a Sunday, so the comedians, I know I'm going to have one of the  highest-paid gigs ever, and I'm at the camp, so to be the best.  Of course you are.  I'm going to be very resentful and not really into it.  Are we getting married in L.A. or Jersey?  Probably L.A.  Come on.  Yeah, he'll do it somewhere.  He'll do an L.A. wedding so he can tell everyone.  Because he thinks he'll get all the celebrities to go there.  Yeah, the stars will come.  Since he's doing the Oscars, he thinks somebody will stop through Denzel and some of his new  friends.  That fan and fatty. 
[02:22:00]  Ralphie May will just be sitting there at a table with no one but himself, eating without  utensils.  It really is going to be an awful wedding.  Jay Moore will be throwing up something that smells like Vicks VapoRub in the corner.  Oh, boss is finished.  Jay's in the paper today.  For what?  What did Jay Moore do, Anthony?  Yeah, that's a cute little story.  The headline is Granny Heckler. 
[02:22:30]  Jay Moore's raunchy comedy almost raised an extra $25,000 for charity on Saturday when  an outraged grandmother offered to pay that much if Moore would just shut his dirty mouth.  At a Minneapolis fundraiser for kids with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the last comic standing  star, joked about how well endowed he was and how he wanted to bag the female auctioneer.  The fed-up granny finally had enough and shouted to Moore that she'd donate $25,000 if he'd 
[02:23:00]  shut up.  He didn't stop and thanked Grandma before he left the stage.  That's the whole story.  Is he well endowed?  I'm trying to remember when he was banging that black hooker in the next room.  Was he?  Legitly?  The black hooker chocolate.  Chocolate, yeah.  I think seven and a half I've heard, Jay, is about seven and a half.  Seven and a half?  Yeah, I guess that would be about right.  I'm impressed with that.  Keith is in his laughter.  I doubt he is.  He laughs at seven and a half.  Seven and a half.  No, you can't do that.  Seven and a half is small. 
[02:23:30]  Small, huh?  I knew Keith would laugh at that.  Jay always said he was a grower, not a shower.  Right.  Which is what he always said.  A grower, not a shower.  Yeah, like if you just pull it out.  Yeah, some guys have, you know, it's a nice presentation.  It's happening already.  And other guys, you know, you're hung like an acorn, but it grows to a massive thing.  Maybe years ago, Florentine and the Wilde used to pull trains with Keith.  I knew Keith, but not as well as I do now.  And Florentine, he'd go, the guy is so abusive to women, all he does is hit him and pull their hair.  It's beautiful. 
[02:24:00]  It's beautiful.  All he would talk about.  It's disgusting.  No, Florentine, all he would talk about was how big Keith's mule was and how it hooked to the  left and how he liked to hurt girls with it.  What else do you have?  You've got a big penis, you hurt women.  Oh, my God.  You won't turn down a nice guy the next time, will you, bitch?  Jeez.  Wow.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Well, they were always goofing on you, making those allegations. 
[02:24:30]  I don't know, but I never heard the story on Last Comic Standing, Tough Crowd, about your  problems with the law and some rape allegation from years ago.  Rape allegation.  What is the story?  Well, you know what happened is this girl, we're in the bed, you know, and I'm pleading  like a son of a bitch, you know, because we're naked in the bed.  You're naked in bed.  Yes, butt naked. 
[02:25:00]  And she was just like, you know, I'm like, come on, let's do something, please, you know.  And she's like, okay, I'll let you do something.  How'd you get her naked in bed if she was not into doing anything?  Just how psychotic some women are.  Women are out of their damn mind.  And she's like, okay, put it halfway in, no pumping.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  So I could just go halfway in and then stop.  Just like that.  She was torturing you.  She was torturing you.  And, you know, of course I pumped. 
[02:25:30]  I pumped like no other man.  Of course.  You can't even help that.  You've got to pump.  You can't help that.  I was off to the races, man.  It's just like, you can go to jail for this.  You know this is rape.  I'm like, how is it rape?  How the hell is that?  How is it rape?  That cannot be rape.  It's been like seven of the times of being accused of rape.  I don't know.  Put it in and don't pump.  No pumping.  That's a true story.  Do not pump.  Halfway in, no pumping whatsoever. 
[02:26:00]  And you pumped?  Of course I pumped.  Of course you did.  Why would I not pump?  And then what happened?  I pumped and I tugged her hair the way I usually do.  She went to the cops?  Well, she said, you know, she called me on the phone like, you know, you raped me.  I'm like, how the hell did I rape you?  You said put it halfway in.  And I figured that was all the way in, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was, she, they were just psychotic.  I'm a vagina's half full kind of guy.  Jesus.  He was clipping.  He's fine.  Oh, yeah.  It was, it was just, you know, where you go.  Women are, I think women are just not, just with that whole rape thing. 
[02:26:30]  It's just, it's too much now.  How did, how did it, how did it get resolved?  I mean, well, you know what, she just never did anything.  The other girl, this one girl who, man, there's too many rape stories.  I know.  Maybe it is me.  Who even has one rape story?  Jesus.  I've never heard someone debate rape in the middle of sex.  You're raping me.  Look, I am not raping you.  He's going over like court reform and legal precedence.  Right.  Court reform. 
[02:27:00]  No.  Oh, my God.  One girl, she was like, I put a passion mark on her.  A passion mark?  Yes.  You know, and her boyfriend's saying.  A hickey.  Yeah, a hickey.  Don't you call a passion mark, you know, according to what neighborhood you're from.  I got you.  And she was, she called, she told her boyfriend's saying, and she called the cops.  Uh-huh.  And told, well, she had to tell him that she was, she had been assaulted by me, you know.  Oh, boy.  So I go over there, my dumb ass go over to the store the next day looking for more, you know, 
[02:27:30]  like, hey, I gave her a good time.  I'm going to go back and cheer the next day.  And she's looking at me mean.  And I'm like, what the hell?  All the store employees are looking at me.  They're surrounding me like, yeah, he's the guy.  That's the rapist.  Yeah, that's the rapist.  Oh, God.  You walk in all happy thinking you're getting laid again.  Yes, I'm thinking some good stuff is going to happen.  And the cops, they pull me over in the parking lot because I finally leave.  I'm telling the rest of the guy, go to hell.  Yeah, I want to fight.  Let's go fight then or whatever.  So I go outside.  I'm walking to my apartment.  The cops pull me over, take me to the police station. 
[02:28:00]  Now, I have to fill out everything that happened, you know, and it's embarrassing.  At first, I tweaked a nipple a little bit.  Every detail, huh?  Yeah, every little detail.  Wow.  I kissed a thigh.  I did this.  I sucked one toe.  Not that toe.  And they're like, okay, they just let it go.  Yeah.  You never had to go on trial for it, though.  No, I've never had to go on trial.  Well, I have one pendant, so I can't really talk about that.  No, from all the way, they brought it up on Tough Crowd all the time. 
[02:28:30]  It sounded like, you know, like Kobe in there, getting that ass, tapping that ass.  It's just, it's hard, man.  I've been with Keith one time when we got pulled over together.  It was, when you lived in Woodbridge, it was me, you.  I don't know if it was Little Kev.  There was four of us in the car.  And we were just kind of sitting, like, we were all just talking in a parking lot.  It was dark.  It was kind of creepy.  We saw the cops, like, hey, what's going on?  You guys all right?  And he's just saying, why are you asking us?  Why?  Oh, no.  And I'm in the driver's seat.  I'm like, shut the fuck up. 
[02:29:00]  I'm going to tow my car.  Yeah, that's another thing I've heard about you.  Not very respectful to the cops when you get pulled over.  You know, it's a Philadelphia thing, man.  It's a black thing, my friend.  You know what?  I swear to God.  And black guys love to talk about when white guys get pulled over, how, you know, it's a big party.  We pat each other on the back, goof on the black guys being pulled over, and, you know, drive away.  But you all whip up that card that you get.  The white card.  The white card.  There you go.  Here's the card officer. 
[02:29:30]  You don't get those cards?  I've never had a card.  Oh, my God.  I get two a week.  What, the PBA cards?  Yeah.  Black guys don't get the PBA cards?  Every white guy has a card.  He must give it to you at birth.  There's a birthright for white guys.  Dude, I got, like, you want one of mine, I got, like, four.  Give me a PBA card.  Look how many he's got.  I'm not kidding.  I got, uh...  Jersey ones, New York.  What, uh, yeah.  Sergeants, lieutenants.  Look at this.  I'm telling you.  I got the one.  Every white guy in this place is pulling out their PBA cards.  Wait, hold on.  I don't even know this one. 
[02:30:00]  I got a sergeant's card.  That's two.  I got two with me.  And usually what happens, as soon as I get a better one, I throw the other one away.  Look at all these cards.  Here's my sergeant's.  Here's my jersey's.  I only got, I only have two right now there.  Me too.  Sergeants and jerseys.  State trooper.  So, you got two as well.  You have three?  We all have two.  Look at that.  Bragging about your cards.  Bragging about all whitey cards.  Your white cards.  You're playing a white card.  That's hilarious.  I just assume the black guys got them, too. 
[02:30:30]  They don't even work.  We had one.  They would just tear it up.  Who did you get this from?  What white guy did you steal this from?  What do you use this for?  Jimmy and open doors?  You know something, though?  I rarely ever even use it.  I don't even remember using those things.  What happens, when I get pulled over, I instantly turn on the dome light.  I pull over immediately.  Turn on the dome light.  Roll the window down.  And put my hands up on the steering wheel until the cop gets to the door. 
[02:31:00]  It relaxes him.  He doesn't have to worry.  He can see in the car the whole time he's walking up.  And then I turn and go, hello, officer.  Good afternoon or night or something.  And continue being respectful.  Let me see.  Do you know what he's doing?  What?  You see what you're doing?  What?  Sneaky.  You're trying to, like, tell me how I should be doing it.  Like, I just jump out of the car and knock the cops out of them.  Can't kick them in his nuts.  I watch cops.  I see out of that windshield camera.  They take you around back.  And when they're looking at you.  He's trying to politely tell me, you blacks are out of hand. 
[02:31:30]  Here's what I do.  Here's what I do as a white person.  As a law-abiding white guy.  I just, any time I'm watching cops, you guys always got that I'm ready to run look.  They're always, like, ready to bolt.  And the second that cop turns around, hey, hey, you.  There they go.  Off like a shot.  But it's surprising.  Those cop shoes, they only show the cops that catch them.  That's true, yeah.  Those fat basses can't catch them. 
[02:32:00]  Those fat guys running brand new sneakers and stuff.  You're not catching them.  Forget that.  Oh, man.  That's very respectful.  So what you're saying is you're respectful when they pull you over.  Like, if they tried to cuff you when you were with little Kev one time for shushing people  out the window, you'd probably be very respectful.  No, no, no.  Shushing.  Yeah, that's what he was doing.  Is that illegal?  Well, the cop, they just stopped me because I'm like, shh.  And the women, they see me, you know, from the car, shut up.  I'm yelling, telling the girl to shut up.  And the cop, they pulled me over.  Well, I wasn't even driving. 
[02:32:30]  Little stupid Kev, Kevin Hart was driving.  And he didn't have a license, that little midget.  Oh, boy.  And the cop is like, well, where's his license at?  He said, well, you know, you're in trouble.  I said, well, this is my car.  I'll do the driving.  He's like, shut up.  Like I said, this is my car.  I'll drive.  He said, what?  Is your car?  Yeah, it's my car.  Get out the car.  I'm getting out the car.  Next thing I know, I'm in a wrestling match with a cop.  Oh, no.  And the thing about it is we're wrestling.  I'm pushing the cop around.  Why are you wrestling? 
[02:33:00]  I can't help it.  What?  I can't help it.  I had some new moves I wanted to try.  I can't help it.  It's instinctive.  I was just watching a Bruce Lee marathon.  I tried some of these out.  What is wrong with you?  If a cop, if I ever got out of the car and the cop wanted to cuff me,  it would probably be the easiest cuffing he ever had in his life.  I would put him back.  I'd be like, officer, give me.  I'll cuff myself.  Well, Courtney, you wouldn't have the handcuffs on.  I would cuff myself. 
[02:33:30]  I could not imagine fighting with a cop who has a gun and a nightstick.  I'm wrestling with, like, five and six cops.  Oh, man.  We're wrestling five and six cops.  And, you know, I end up just like, oh, what the hell am I doing?  I end up thinking to myself, what am I doing?  A little moment of clarity.  Yeah.  I put my hand.  It was too late then.  But I put my hands behind.  They cuffed me, put me on the ground.  They whip out pepper spray.  And me, movie guy, for some reason, a movie theme came to my head.  I'm like, fuck pepper spray. 
[02:34:00]  I eat pepper spray.  Oh, no.  And he made me eat it.  I started crying like a little girl.  He emptied the can in my eyes.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy.  Wow.  You're insane.  And you still like this with the cops?  Yes.  It's just, we all, in Philadelphia, we used to fight cops like they were civilians.  So, you know, it's just, I try my best to just click off that cop thing that's in my 
[02:34:30]  head so I don't get a nice, tasty bullet.  How often do you get pulled over?  I haven't been pulled over for a minute.  I haven't been pulled over for a minute.  It's usually, I use, my first ever arrest was looking at prostitutes.  Yeah.  You would go there looking at me and my stupid cousin.  And the cops tell us to get the hell out of the, just go.  And I'm mouthing off, go.  What about that white guy?  He's getting a blowjob right there.  Oh, boy.  So, I'm going to be Malcolm X with prostitutes.  Look at the white guy.  How about the white man?  Stop him from getting a blowjob before you mess with me. 
[02:35:00]  So, they take us to the jailhouse, to the police station.  And my cousin, he's running his mouth.  He's like, where's the brothers at?  Huh?  That's what I want to know.  Where's the brothers at?  So, the cop point him to a brother, like, there's a brother.  Call him a brother.  And my cousin said, oh, I didn't say nothing.  I start laughing.  The black cop threw me against the wall.  He must have smacked me 72 times in a row.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't like that either.  Oh, it was just, you know.  So, that, you know, cops and me and cops never get along. 
[02:35:30]  No, no.  That's hilarious.  Keith Robinson in studio.  Anthony, we've got to take a quick break because Bernie Getz wants to say hi.  Oh, Bernie's on the phone.  I hope he doesn't get too paranoid and hang up during the break.  A real short break, and we'll talk to Bernie Getz next.  Stay there.  Dude, what happened?  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass. 
[02:36:00]  Jesus Christ.  What an anticlimactic piece of crap that was.  Hey, he shoots.  ACC basketball.  It's the ACC today.  Tie your shoes nice and tight because ACC basketball is breaking you down.  You better box your man out because we're grabbing the boards.  Round ball, baby.  It's the ACC today on XM Satellite Radio.  Cut off the ricochet.  It's Wednesday, the 16th of February, 2005.  I'm Ari Bikowski with the ACC today. 
[02:36:30]  Well, part of it is we didn't have all of our guys in rebound.  We had five guards in at times.  So that, and then with our big guys in foul trouble, sometimes you're not as aggressive  in some of the things you do.  You're playing cautiously.  And, you know, if you're not fouled out, if you have a lot of foul trouble, you, it changes  the tenure, the tenure of the game.  You know, I mean, there's just, it just changes the game.  And that's Duke head coach, Mike Krzyzewski, after the overtime loss to Maryland over the 
[02:37:00]  weekend.  And if you saw the game, Williams, Randolph, Melchione, and Ewing all fouled out.  And that's, well, take some air out of your tires, to say the least.  Duke will try to bounce back against Va Tech and Blacksburg tomorrow night.  Check the action out on ACC channel 191.  Yes, I did say 191.  We've changed our location on your XM radios.  All college sports will occupy channels 191 to 199 from now on out.  So please make sure you change your settings on your radio so you don't miss your favorite  ACC teams. 
[02:37:30]  Go at it.  And by the way, tip-off for that Duke and Virginia Tech contest is set for 9 p.m.  Eastern.  Now to some football news.  Important announcements coming from Greensboro as the ACC has announced that it will use instant  replay on an experimental basis beginning with the 2005 season.  The proposed 2005 agenda was presented by the league's athletic directors and was approved  unanimously by the faculty representatives at the conference winter meetings.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:38:00]  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Program.  Keith Robinson in studio.  We were just talking about his iPod.  Did you steal that?  No.  There was an article in the paper the other day that, yeah, the thieves are stealing iPods  left and right.  Oh, they're taking them off of people? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Whitey's walking around with the white cords and they're getting ripped off.  See, I need to know that information, man.  Because I walk around with my Bose headphones and my iPod.  And I didn't know that they were taking iPods now.  Yeah, but they're not going to take yours because it looks like you're listening to a cassette  play or something.  No, what gives it away is the white cords, I'm telling you.  You've got the white cords dangling from your ears, you know, the stock earbuds that come  They pretty much said the homeboys are ripping off the iPods from the white kids, the white 
[02:39:00]  students.  The white students.  Is that it?  Well, easy pickings.  It's Black History Month.  At a stop.  After this month, it's a short month.  We've got to get to that last story, but I don't want Bernie Getz to hang up on us, so  let's go to Bernie real fast.  Bernie!  Hey, good morning.  Good morning, Bernie Getz.  It's the subway vigilante.  Are you enjoying Black History Month, Bernie?  I don't pay too much attention to it.  No, huh?  I don't pay too much attention to a lot of things. 
[02:39:30]  I'm more interested in squirrels and electronics.  And vegetarianism.  Absolutely.  Of course.  Bernie, I hear you have changed some of your platform on your run for mayor?  Just rearranged it a little.  Rearranged it a little?  What are some of the changes?  Well, just, you know, the order, making it more business in terms of the finances of the  city, emphasizing more the rebuilding on Ground Zero and things like that.  Well, that was in your platform before, though.  I remember reading that.  That's correct.  Also, I figured it's probably the right thing to back up the mayor on the West Side Stadium, 
[02:40:00]  even though I think the West Side Stadium and the Olympics are much less important to  the economy of New York City than rebuilding the old World Trade Center site correctly.  Well, Ground Zero could be a cash cow for New York City if it's rebuilt correctly.  Bernie, as far as education is concerned, my friend was saying that they definitely got  to get somebody in there who's going to, you know, do it.  And I'm like, yeah, but what about, you know, what's been going on? 
[02:40:30]  You're talking about the New York City school system?  Yeah, because I think that what's happening there is just the education is, well, you know,  I mean...  Well, the education always has been bad.  And Bloomberg stuck his foot in his mouth a little bit, saying, judge me on how I, you  know, handle this New York City school system.  Now, around the world, they found...  Something Daryl Kavey can't do, put his foot in his mouth.  Well, you know, the greatest indicator, the greatest indicator by far of how students perform 
[02:41:00]  in school doesn't have to do with race, doesn't have to do with the money spent in the school  room, it has to do with family background.  Now, Bloomberg inherited...  Oh, God, Norton spit his water out.  Sorry, yes, Bernie.  Okay, well, Bloomberg inherited the situation that he got.  Rudy Giuliani was a good mayor, but the biggest mistake Rudy Giuliani made was when he got  rid of Rudy Crue.  Yeah, there's puking water everywhere.  And Rudy Crue was, you know...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, education.  Bernie, what about this invention? 
[02:41:30]  You were supposed to come in with your inventions.  Uh, well, I make the world's best levitator.  He doesn't want to really discuss it, I hear, Bernie?  Well, no, no, I do different things, but I make the world's best levitator.  It actually broke two days ago.  I have to fix it again.  How does the levitator work, Bernie?  Okay, two things.  It's a servomechanism.  Right.  You lift an object with an electric magnet.  Yeah.  That's the first thing, and how you control the magnet. 
[02:42:00]  The second thing is you detect the magnetism of the object being lifted.  Aha.  And therefore, you have invisible lifting, and you have invisible detection of the position  of the object.  And you have the thing simply floating in air.  Floating in the air.  Yes.  That's something.  But it broke on you, huh?  Yeah, well, these are electronic devices, and I'm doing general work on it.  Yeah, well, perhaps the armature sprocket is causing interference, which in turn is blocking  a flow with a Dynaflow. 
[02:42:30]  I wish I knew.  What's the heaviest object it can lift?  About two pounds.  Okay.  Two pounds, just in case you can't lift up two pounds.  Yeah.  That's about the weight of a gun, I believe, huh?  Well, yes.  You could use it as a display to levitate a gun in the air.  That would be interesting.  That's a rather good idea, actually.  A gun levitated next to you as you're maybe getting on the subway, and then if the cops  come, you say, hey, it's not mine.  It's just floating next to me.  Okay.  That's correct.  Anyway, Bernie, what do you think about the gates in Central Park? 
[02:43:00]  Have you seen them?  No, I haven't seen them.  My neighbor went and saw them on Sunday, and she said it was very nice.  She said it's a great thing to see, and if you don't see it, you'll wish you had and  whatever, but I'm not into that type of thing.  I don't think I'm going to go up there and see it.  She said it changes color continuously as time goes on, and it was very nice.  I think it's kind of...  He lives with a bunch of kooks.  Bernie, the gates stink, and it's a waste of time, and they're not changing colors.  They're orange, and they're staying orange. 
[02:43:30]  Well, she said it's the sun change.  She liked it, but anyway, I think it's a waste of money.  Also, if they're going to do an outdoor display like that, it's a little early in the year.  They should have waited another month or so when the weather's better, because I know  we had a good day.  We had some good weather, relatively good.  Well, I think if it would have snowed, then it would have been very cool, the contrast.  Bernie, I have a question for you.  As mayor...  That was funny. 
[02:44:00]  Vegetarianism.  A lot of people are saying that it probably should be in mostly of the school for the menus, and what do you, you know...  Yes, I feel strongly about that, that the children in school in particular should have vegetarian options.  You can offer them both.  And vegetarian options, it doesn't mean like...  A lot of times you hear the authorities in the jail say, well, people can be vegetarian, they can eat more vegetables.  But that's not enough.  You have to offer real soy alternatives for meat alternatives. 
[02:44:30]  You need a balance of, you know, fat, protein, and carbohydrate.  You have to go about it seriously.  Also, I feel wherever the kids...  The kids have Snapple drinks available all over the schools.  And I feel there should be something better than, you know, water with corn syrup in it.  Wherever they have Snapple soft drinks, they should also have soaked soy milks.  Oh, let's choose that over a Snapple drink or a Snapple.  Oh, that's a tough decision. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, but do you really like...  I mean, if they're going to have a vegetarian...  Do you think that soy milk, though, is going to be, you know, as popular?  Well, I like it better than regular milk.  I don't know if you've ever tried the silk soy milks, but they...  One of their brands called Enhanced Silk Soy Milk has flaxseed oil in it, which is crucial for vegetarians.  And they also have another flavor called Very Vanilla Soy Milk. 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  And what I do is I mix maybe 20%, 30% Very Vanilla Soy Milk with the...  You actually sit there and mix the milks together?  No, you don't mix.  You just...  I have two half-gallon containers in the fridge.  Boring!  And I pour in some Enhanced Silk Soy Milk, and it tastes good, and it's very good for you.  And the kids would drink it up like, you know, they'd like it as much as pot.  You can just interrupt.  All right, yeah, I just want to ask you a question.  Now, there's a problem with fat kids in the school.  Yep.  What will you do about them?  Because they breathe real hard and they disturb the whole room? 
[02:46:00]  Good question.  Having a good diet, vegetarian alternatives, would really help that a lot.  There's an excellent movie out.  I think it's been pulled, so you can still rent it, but it's up for the Academy Awards.  It's called Super Size Me.  Yes.  And most people have heard about it.  It's about this guy who has an experiment.  Didn't you put out a movie called Paralyze Me?  No, no, no, no.  The, um, uh, uh, uh, but I think that this guy... 
[02:46:30]  That was a movie also about overindulgence.  A lead diet.  Okay, Super Size, he eats nothing but McDonald's for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 30 days.  Right.  And he actually gets quite sick.  And it's, it was very revealing.  Yes.  They didn't expect that things would turn out the way how they did.  And I think that it's very educational for anyone to see that movie, even if they don't eat at McDonald's.  What about the squirrels?  You said, you know, you're into squirrels. 
[02:47:00]  What about them?  Uh, yes.  I have a, I have a little, uh, pet squirrel.  That talks.  Who's nice.  Your pet squirrel talk?  He took already and brought him back.  And, uh, I'm probably looking for another one.  He's, he's very nice.  He's not destructive.  But we don't love each other.  And I think it's important.  You don't love your squirrel?  Uh, no.  No, no.  We, we get along and we play, but there just, um, there just isn't love there.  I'm, I'm actually looking for another one.  We gotta, we gotta continue with the squirrel love thing.  Are you saying, in a weird way, that the relationship is lacking in some sort of intimacy? 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Now, now, have you loved a squirrel before?  Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  And the squirrel has loved you.  And how did you know that the squirrel was in love with you?  You just know.  You know, when, love is a very, women feel it much more easily than guys.  With guys, it's unusual.  When, when you love someone or something, you actually get a warm feeling when you see them.  Are you seeing other squirrels?  Well, I go feed the squirrels frequently, but I, uh.  Now, Bernie, you could, you know how you could tell if the squirrel loves Bernie? 
[02:48:00]  Bernie walks around and looks like he sat on Daniel Boone's hat.  That's how you know it's true love.  You, you, you know, you know, uh, if you're, if you love something.  And it's, but it's not something to be lied about.  Bernie.  Most people BS about it.  Do you get the hard-ons, though, from the squirrel love?  No.  No.  It's not that kind of relationship.  Now, when you're out looking at squirrels, right?  What?  When you see them, you go feed the squirrels.  If a black squirrel comes up, do you shoot them?  Uh, no.  No. 
[02:48:30]  I, I, they all get, they all get treated the same.  They all, they try to give them all avocado.  So at least he treats the squirrels the same.  Yeah.  I imagine the black squirrels get a little less avocado.  No.  No, they don't.  They, they, uh, they probably, uh, they generally actually eat it a little bit more.  They get the avocado, but through a slingshot.  He gives them, you know, the squirrels, he just doesn't want the squirrels coming up  and asking them for five pieces of avocado.  They eat it from my hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you were, you were in love with the squirrel. 
[02:49:00]  That's very fascinating.  Yeah.  Anyway, let me plug my website.  Oh, of course.  Okay.  It's called bernieformayor.com.  That's all words.  B-E-R-N-I-E-F-O-R.  Wait, wait, wait.  Uh, B-E-W-W-U-R.  We're not going to go through that again.  bernieformayor.com.  All right.  Uh, oh, oh, uh, F-O-R-E.  Bernie for, no, number four.  Normal, normal, wait, four.  And it has links to all the other.  F-O-U-R?  Bernie.  Don't forget.  And cut it out.  It has links to all the other mayor, mayor, mayoral candidates' websites. 
[02:49:30]  Who else is running, Bernie?  Well, there's, uh, I will just, uh, click on my thing here.  Charles Barron just dropped out.  Yeah, he stinks.  And that's because we don't, well, all of them do.  Hey, is it true you're going on vacation up in New England there?  I go there regularly, yes.  Not a little vacation business.  You're still looking for that gun?  No.  Chris Brodeur is planning on running the independent somewhere in the Democratic primary. 
[02:50:00]  Fernando Ferrer is running.  What do you think of Chris Brodeur?  What?  What do you think of Chris Brodeur?  He is intelligent, very conceited.  Oh.  Hey, Vijay from Rhode Island wants to know if you play with the squirrels' nuts.  No.  I play with the squirrels, not with their nuts.  Bernie, can I ask you, I heard Ben had told us you had some plans for Central Park if you're elected mayor?  Well, what I noticed, not really, I think Central Park has been pretty good, but one thing. 
[02:50:30]  Probably really large fences.  The water in the Central Park.  At the north end?  At the north end.  The water in the Central Park's lake.  And a moat around it.  I'd like to see recirculating microfilters or aerators in there.  Wait, wait.  To try to make the water in the Central Park lakes clear.  But, you know, by Belvedere Castle and the boathouse.  You want to clean up that water?  Yeah, but the water, instead of being dark and...  You hate dark, man.  And full of algae.  The water should be clear.  You know how many accountants would be visible at the bottom of that lake if they cleaned it up? 
[02:51:00]  I think that's hiding a world of hurt.  Hey, Bernie, when do we get to go to your apartment?  Why do you want to go to my apartment?  I mean, why...  Ben says that you've invited us over for lunch or something.  Well, you can come over one day.  To check out some of your inventions and things like that.  Okay, that's at the office.  You can come...  Well, actually, it's fine for you to see it.  And I told...  I bumped into Ben Sparks a few days ago on the street.  Yes, you did.  It was working then, but I have to fix it.  He's got a big squirrel in his pants.  I thought he was chasing a squirrel in his pants. 
[02:51:30]  In front of Ben's pants.  He's in love with Ben's squirrel.  Ben's like, dude, what are you trying to feed that for?  Dude, it's not the same.  By the way, my squirrel licks honey off of my fingers.  Oh, your fingers?  If I put honey on my fingers...  Really?  Way to break him in, Bernie.  I thought he said his squirrel licks honey.  Apparently a bunch of thumbs are running.  You know, as what you would expect for mayor.  Yeah.  And it'll be a rather crummy, you know, low-life mayor's race, which is what you'd expect from New York politics. 
[02:52:00]  Of course.  I generally think that New York is some of the worst politicians in the country.  I agree wholeheartedly.  Yeah.  I think Bloomberg has been responsible.  And I think that Hillary Clinton, Schumer, and Pataki, they're all garbage.  Hey, that's a good idea.  Yeah, just get rid of the rest of the candidates and you'll be mayor.  Yeah.  Let's say they asked you for five bucks.  No, but I think it would be great if the public here would get rid of Pataki and get rid of our... 
[02:52:30]  Ernie, how do you express the love to a squirrel, though?  Just usually by...  Because when a man and a woman are in love, they do certain things.  They go to your diners and chick motels before flights.  Yeah, you can't just say you're in love with a squirrel and that's it.  There's got to be some kind of exchange of emotion.  Well, yes, with affection.  It has to do mostly with gentle touching and stuff like that.  Genital touching?  Gentle touching.  Oh, he's not genital touching. 
[02:53:00]  That's a lot different.  Sorry, Bernie.  I was trying to make him funny.  I know.  Yeah.  So gentle touching and then the squirrel that would love you is receptive to this touching.  The squirrel that doesn't love you is not receptive.  Clawing your eyes out.  Well, squirrels are not aggressive.  They run from a fight.  But they let you know if they are unhappy about a situation.  And usually squirrels do not want to be around other animals.  They're very timid. 
[02:53:30]  So you're gently touching the squirrel?  Yes.  You stroke it, right?  Yes.  So you get it to lick honey off your fingers?  Sure, sure.  I pull on his ears a lot.  From the back?  No, he eats from my hand normally, but it's just something I started the past week or so.  The squirrels...  It turns out he likes honey.  I tried it with the squirrels in Union Square Park in Peter Cooper Village, but they didn't like the honey.  No, I wouldn't think so.  Well, would a squirrel lick honey off your mule if it didn't trust you?  That's correct.  That's correct. 
[02:54:00]  If it gets close to you, there is a degree of trust.  Well, how long before...  Like, you've had the squirrel for a while.  How long before it would actually finally lick honey off your mule?  Because I know it's not a new thing.  Off my finger?  No, I only started that a week ago.  It's too good for you.  Now, you stroke it, right?  And then, are you able to kiss the head?  So what?  What's the big deal about that?  I'm just wondering if you kiss the head.  Occasionally, sometimes I touch my fingers and give them a little kiss or something. 
[02:54:30]  That's no big deal.  Hey, Bernie, we're joking around, but I really need to know this.  Have you ever seen a squirrel's penis?  Of course.  How big is it?  How big is it?  It varies on the squirrel.  Some squirrels have bigger ones than another one.  The black ones are bigger, right?  No, no.  I would call it...  No?  A myth.  Who knew?  It might be on the outside.  Normally, it might be about a little, maybe half an inch long, and maybe a little bit smaller in diameter, 
[02:55:00]  half the diameter of a pen, that type of thing, or two-thirds the diameter of a pen.  No big deal.  I mean, now that you...  I know that you want to know.  What color is it?  Now you know.  Maybe you want to dream about it.  Who knows?  Oh, no, no.  Is it pink like a dog's?  No, it's the same color as your skin.  Which is like a...  What color is that?  Well, it's just whatever it is down there, gray, white. 
[02:55:30]  Gray?  I...  Have you ever seen it?  If you...  Have you ever seen it...  Should I take a picture and send you a picture?  Oh, yes.  Yes, definitely.  Have you ever seen it like erect?  You can put it in your computer and your, you know, and with all your other pictures.  Or your ear.  Bernie, I would like a picture of that.  If you want to send a picture of that, my email address is kevin.straley at xmradio.com.  I'm not going to send you a picture.  So, anyway.  But, anyway, with the city, there are some things that are important.  Oh, right. 
[02:56:00]  And the rebuilding of ground zero is important.  Hold on.  We've got some questions, you know, from the public.  You're a candidate from the public.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Jersey.  Jerry, you're talking to Bernie Getz, the subway vigilante.  Oh, hi, Bernie.  Hello.  Hi.  Bernie, you seem to have some really creative ideas for the public school system.  Thank you.  I was wondering, how would you fix the Negro lunch money-stealing problem?  Well, I think there should be free lunch.  I also think...  Oh, that would fix it.  ...which there is.  I think there would be less bullying in the whole society, and particularly in the schools, 
[02:56:30]  if more kids were vegetarian.  You think vegetarian...  The vegetarian kids would do less bullying.  All right, let's go to...  All right, let's go to Steve on Long Island.  You made your point.  Steve?  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hi, Steve.  Morning, Bernie.  I was just wondering, do the black squirrels like their avocados deep-fried with grape soda?  No.  No.  All of them like their food raw.  All squirrels.  Raw.  Of course.  Everybody knows that.  I don't understand where that crazy question came from. 
[02:57:00]  Except, sometimes squirrels, they're like a baked potato.  They might prefer a potato if it's just baked.  Really?  Do they have an intern wash the potato first and only handle it a certain way?  No, no, no, no.  I just throw it in the microwave, and they'll eat, they'll eat it.  Potato, diva, squirrels.  Other food they prefer.  They prefer...  Well, they'll eat broccoli that's cooked a little bit, too, but they prefer it raw.  Yeah.  All right, Bernie.  Well, when are you coming in again?  I don't know.  I'm just busy.  I'm behind on things.  I have to earn a living.  Yeah.  And with the various projects I got in, I just get behind. 
[02:57:30]  Bernie, what do you do for a living?  What do you do?  What pays the bills?  I buy and sell industrial electronics.  You buy and sell industrial electronics?  Yep.  Where, like on eBay?  I do a fair amount of contacts from eBay.  I buy a little on eBay.  And like what?  If somebody needs...  What kind of electronics?  The type of equipment you might use in your studio.  RF equipment.  Or the things they would use to check out your transmitters and receivers.  And high voltage equipment.  Things that utility companies would use. 
[02:58:00]  I got you.  All right.  All right.  Very good, Bernie.  Okay.  You want...  We're looking forward to you coming in, though, again.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  We have more questions from the public, Ope?  Well, another question?  Do we have more time?  I know you're a busy guy.  No, I've got time.  And now's a good time.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tony in Jersey.  Tony, you're on the phone.  Yeah.  Mayoral candidate Bernie Gess.  Hello.  Bernie, how do you feel about ebonics?  Ebonics?  Don't know much about it.  I think people should be well-spoken, though.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:58:30]  That answer to his question.  Okay.  Pretty much stop that, Dan.  Okay.  Glad we went to that last one.  I know.  I know.  All right.  Okay, guys.  Well, you know, it's business with me, so...  All right, Bernie.  So, anyway, if people want,  they can look at my website  and, you know,  and look at the miserable politics of New York.  Bernieformayor.com.  Thank you.  Oh, I thought it was  youdon'tlooksobad.com.  Oh, yeah.  I'll be remembered for that. 
[02:59:00]  Have another dot-ness.  Not a lie.  Like Mantanya at the end of House of Games.  Thank you, sir.  I have another.  Well, very good.  What party are you running under, Bernie?  I'll be running as an independent.  I might seek the Libertarian Party nomination.  Do you want to play a good song there?  What is it going to take to get your name on the ballot?  Oh, a lot of running around and hassle and begging,  and I may not even be able to get on the ballot.  It's very hard to get on the ballot.  Well, what do you need?  Signatures, right? 
[02:59:30]  Yep.  How many?  Well, you need 7,500 as an independent.  Dude, we can get you those signatures in no time.  You could, but they have to be signatures of New York City residents.  Yeah, we can do that.  Yeah, how do we do this for you?  We'll help you out.  I would love to see Bernie Getz on the ballot.  Would I love that?  How do we do it?  Well, you usually have people on the street just asking the public to sign it.  And the best line, what we tell people is,  this doesn't mean you're voting for me.  It just means it helps me get on the ballot. 
[03:00:00]  And people just like to hear a simple line like that, sign it, and go on their way.  All right, Bernie.  Well, we have interns that might be able to help with that.  It's a lot of work.  It's probably the political people, you know, people running for city council and other things.  That's probably the way to go about it.  Okay.  Well, Bernie, it's always a pleasure.  Okay.  Did you want to hear a song today, you were saying?  Yeah.  Why don't you play that song?  I think it's called by Brother Phelps.  It's called Let Go.  By Brother Phelps? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, you know, let go.  Let go?  I thought you hated the brothers.  Not that brother.  You know, Ben, do you know there's Ben there?  Ben?  He knows the songs pretty well.  He's outside.  He's got his cock on a hand truck.  Okay.  Well, whatever.  Whatever.  Squirrel nesting in his hair.  We don't have Brother Phelps, Bernie.  You don't?  We don't have Brother Phelps.  Do you know the library of songs we have at the XM computer?  No.  And it is millions, and that song isn't in it. 
[03:01:00]  How about Fly Like the Wind?  You don't?  Fly Like the Wind.  That's the music.  You ever hear that?  How about Can You Keep Your Mouth Shut by Paul Shanley?  Oh, I wish I had heard that 20 years ago.  It's action.  All right, Bernie.  Okay.  Okay, guys.  Have a good time.  See you soon, Bernie.  Thank you.  Good luck with your mayo race and your levitation machine.  And my squirrels.  Thank you.  And your squirrels.  And your squirrels.  Bye, Bernie. 
[03:01:30]  Bernie, Bernie.  Yes.  Yeah?  I shoot faster than that, guys.  Oh, wow.  He's getting all cocky.  Speed is everything.  Speed is everything.  That's right.  There's Bernie Guts not going off half-cocked.  We love it.  Bernie, thank you so much.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes, Bernie Guts.  Boys, as nutty as a fruitcake.  We can't get enough of Bernie Guts.  I love Bernie Guts. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, man.  Squirrel love.  I would love to see him be the mayor.  I would love to see him just get on the ballot, that the news people would have to acknowledge  that Bernie Guts is on the ballot.  We don't have to get him the signature.  We really need to get him the signature.  I would just love to see him molest a squirrel.  That would make my day.  What is going on over there?  What goes on in that head of his is just stunning.  There's squirrel love.  There's shooting black people.  There's running for mayor.  He's a busy guy.  Vegetarianism.  Vegetarianism and how it's going to save the world. 
[03:02:30]  No one would get their lunch money taken if it was all vegetarian because vegetarian food  sucks so bad.  Nobody would want to get beat up.  No one would want it, right.  Nobody would punch you for money to buy it.  He said something that was very obvious.  He said the vegetarians wouldn't go around bullying people.  It's obvious they don't.  They're the ones that get beat up in school.  They're the little emaciated people.  You've never seen a vegetarian bully.  No.  You have no protein in you.  You're too weak to fight.  I'll put this carrot in your chest. 
[03:03:00]  Give me your broccoli, man.  Give me it.  It doesn't happen.  Keith Robinson in studio.  We'll continue in just a sec here.  Oh, there's another killer in the OJ family.  There is.  We got the story next.  Another?  He was never...  When you call this effing show, there are four words that you must know.  Learn to punch out.  I'm punchin' out.  I'm punchin' out.  Punchin' out.  Punchin' out.  You're gonna be great.  Hey, you ever do that language?  Where are you going on?

Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  XM 202.  Everything you say to me.  I need one step, one step, one step, one step.  And I'm up on the break.  I need another room to break.  I need another one step, one step, one step, one step.  And I'm up on the break. 
[03:05:30]  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  We're back already?  Yeah, we're back already.  Your ink is all over your hands.  Well, I had to go wash them, yeah.  That's because you tap the pen and the ink splats out of it.  And you get it all over your hands.  And then you wipe your face and you got, like, ink on you.  I think you have ink under your eye.  Oh, that's great.  You look like one of Keith's date's black eye. 
[03:06:00]  I'm a fidgety mess.  Keith Robinson in studio.  Jim Norton wandering around.  That's what sucks.  We think we could actually take a little break from the action.  No.  And we all go our separate ways.  Separate ways.  And next thing you know, we're wondering where Jimmy is.  Back on the air.  Jimmy's like, we're back.  Is this nuts or what?  I took a leak in the back of it.  How long of a break is that?  I think that was at least 45 seconds.  Old pigeon bladder.  Didn't you take a leak just last break? 
[03:06:30]  Dude, I am awful, my bladder.  That was something else we've been trying to work on and getting nowhere.  We need, like, longer breaks to go to.  Yeah.  I hate going to the comedy clips.  Nah, those are awful.  Everyone's heard them a thousand times.  Frustrating.  You're in the bathroom.  You're just getting to know someone.  All of a sudden, I hear you guys back on the air.  Got to zip up and get the number on the way out.  Keith, did you check out the gates in Central Park?  Yes.  I've seen the orange.  It looks like a construction site.  It's awful.  It is. 
[03:07:00]  And I'm so glad the press is finally catching on how awful and stupid this thing is,  and now they're all trashing it.  At first, they thought it was the greatest thing.  It's putting a lot of money into the economy of New York, but besides that, it's just awful.  You know what it is?  You don't want to come off looking stupid, is what it is, and uncultured.  So, at first, everybody was like, oh, this is great.  It's this new art thing they're doing.  You never want to bash art because you look like a savage.  You're uncivilized and uncultured.  And so, everybody was kind of like, yeah, this is going to be interesting. 
[03:07:30]  They put it up.  You walk around, and it's like, I have no idea what this means.  Are they trying to get more people in Central Park?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not enough people.  Dude, it's working.  Hundreds of thousands of people have made their way to Central Park so far.  And I saw yesterday tourists walking around with T-shirts with the gates on them.  That's just going to get more tourists robbed in Central Park.  There you go.  Yeah, they're too busy looking at the stupid gate.  Look at the pretty orange colors. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  And then people are walking around with maps.  It's like maps.  If you've seen one, you've seen them all.  So, if you want to put up gates in Central Park, keep it at the north end, all in a row,  with some chain link and maybe some barbed wire on top.  That's the type of gates Central Park can use.  Well, the letters to the editor, they're just going nuts now.  People are writing in like crazy about the gates in Central Park.  Let's see, this one.  Ian writes, what is this nonsense in Central Park?  I've heard people say it's poetic and adds to the flow of the park. 
[03:08:30]  Look, the park flows well all by itself.  No one has the guts to question the great Christo.  Oh, that's a question.  No one has the guts to question the great Christo.  No one wants to be the first to say it's baloney.  Well, it's baloney.  Baloney.  Wow.  He showed him.  Martha from Seaford, Long Island.  The Central Park gates look like something sponsored by Home Depot.  Yeah, we had said that.  We said that on the show.  And finally, Robert writes, thank goodness the city didn't have to pay for the gates.  What a horrible investment.  They actually make Central Park look like a giant orange car wash. 
[03:09:00]  It's a car wash.  Yeah.  Something else we said on the program.  That's interesting.  Did you read the one letter that said that they're really beautiful and they add a lot  to the park by Big K from New Jersey?  That ass.  And then Big Kev helped put it up.  He was part of the construction group.  Friend of the show here.  Big guy.  And then our buddy, our pal, good old Tony Danza.  They got a bunch of pictures of him in the Daily News.  Yeah.  He's rollerblading under the gates with a camera, I guess, filming something for his 
[03:09:30]  stupid show.  Got a camera.  And the dummy hits the gate with his right rollerblade, falls down hard into the gate,  and the camera goes flying.  Like, this is no bit.  That is fantastic.  Just looking like a complete idiot.  They got four pictures in the Daily News today.  Here's what it looks like.  It looks like his foot went into a grate that's on the sidewalk there.  And his feet go right out from under him. 
[03:10:00]  He face plants into one of the poles, and his broken camera is now laying on the sidewalk.  And I don't know.  You think they'll show that on his show?  Is it supposed to be today, maybe?  I'm sure they'll show it.  If they can get a fell.  Yeah.  Let's see that.  My big fat mule just got in the way, and I tripped over it.  All right?  That guy doesn't make you just feel like an idiot to be Italian.  There are some Italian guys that just like...  Why do people just hate this guy? 
[03:10:30]  This is a guy that is certain celebrities that people just hate.  Yeah.  You know, why do you just latch on to certain celebrities and go, ugh?  You know, I think because he's a phony, I think it's all an act, and he's not that nice and cutesy in real life.  Yeah, there have been stories about Tony Danza that weren't really that cute and nice, you know?  And he comes up, and now he's a talk show host that just has droves of these rubes from the Midwest.  These women come in and just adore him.  And, you know, he's playing the part well. 
[03:11:00]  Seems to be doing all right.  But he's one of those guys that, like, as an Italian guy, you look at him, and it's just dripping wop.  You know, that whole thing.  Just be an American guy, you know?  He's always, hey, we're cooking some pasta today.  My grandma's meatballs are going to be fantastic.  We're going to cook that up.  I'm going to wear a red, white, and green hat and a little curly mustache like on a fucking pizza box.  It's like, and when I see stuff like that, all I can think of is how a black guy would feel if it's like, 
[03:11:30]  Lord and Lord, we got some fried chicken and woody melon today.  It's the same way I look at that.  It's like this, you don't have to be overly ethnic.  It's ridiculous.  He's a stereotype of an Italian guy, as I talk with my hands.  And you were watching the Deli Show?  I got the clip.  Is this worth playing?  Well, Stephen Colbert, they went to him as the senior art correspondent, whatever it was, for the Daily Show. 
[03:12:00]  And he really summed up in great sarcasm what these gates are all about.  Yeah, you guys got to understand, in the rest of the country, how ridiculous this looks in Central Park.  It's, you know, front page.  And if you think it's art, that's fine, because a lot of people are emailing me going,  hey, you don't know what you're talking about, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But it really looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  It's not, I don't see it as art.  I see it as a construction project.  This is something, I think art has to be done. 
[03:12:30]  I can't define art, but I think a good rule of thumb is something very unique that only you can do,  and somebody really can't duplicate it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It can't be, you can't take the Mona Lisa and paint it again.  It's, you can't, this project just looks way too simple.  Yeah.  Way too simple.  You have enough money and people with wrenches.  You know, you could bolt this thing together. 
[03:13:00]  That's, to me, that isn't really art.  How many gates were there?  Like 7,500 or something like that?  7,500.  All looking the same.  Yeah, so I don't, I don't see it as that, but.  And they're calling it saffron.  It's just, it's just, it's orange.  Home Depot orange.  And it looks very cheap, too, by the way.  It's just very cheap looking.  Yeah, so this is what The Daily Show had to say about it.  It's pretty funny.  Simply put, the gates is a triumph, John.  An artistic milestone that may finally put New York on the cultural map. 
[03:13:30]  I don't want to get ahead of myself here, John,  but I think this may do for the Big Apple what the West Wing has done for Washington, D.C.  Or what the band Asia did for that continent.  John, the gates is a triumph of contemporary installation art.  Each gate redefining its section of the park as not a public place for private reflection,  but a private place for public reflection. 
[03:14:00]  Juxtaposed with the barrenness of the midwinter,  the gates posits a chromatic orgy.  This riot of color achieves a rare re-defamiliarization with the nature of place-time,  the what-ness of our where-ness.  No longer framed.  I'm sorry, I've run out of crap. 
[03:14:30]  As our conceptual art, I mean, is this great art?  Yes, John.  Because like all great art, it challenges what we thought we knew about the world.  For instance, I used to think $21 million could be used to achieve something noble,  like, I don't know, build a hospital wing.  But the gates has forced me to recontextualize my notion of what $21 million can be used for.  In this case, redecorating a bike path. 
[03:15:00]  So you believe that shrouding these walkways and these orange curtains will somehow change our lives in New York?  You know, it's happening already, John.  Just today, I saw an installation artist take a sandwich and wrap it in a paper-like substance,  almost waxy in texture.  And he kept wrapping it, and obviously I'm not doing it justice here, 
[03:15:30]  but he kept wrapping it until he had visually achieved not-sandwich.  Then, and this is the genius part, John, at the last minute, he cut it in two in a final act of re-sandwichment.  So, so, so, you had lunch at a deli?  Okay.  Fine.  I was at a deli ordering lunch. 
[03:16:00]  That's how you need to think of it.  John.  They do a real good job on that show.  Stephen Colbert is very funny.  He is.  The whole gang over there, man.  That daily show is great.  Perhaps the best door slam I ever got at Tough Crowd was Colbert in the middle of talking.  Really?  I asked him a question, he starts talking, and I slammed that door so hard, I knocked lights out of the fixtures.  That sounds like a great gag.  He was one of the guys that laughed the hardest at us. 
[03:16:30]  So, you would be in what, the green room or something?  Everyone.  These guys do this gag all the time.  Yeah, they ask you a question, and then you're like, oh.  You start answering the question, and then you just walk out.  Nice door slam.  Slend the door.  I'm going out as the person tries to answer your question.  Who is it?  Hal Sparks' name?  Hal Sparks.  Oh, he hated me for it.  He didn't get it?  No.  No.  He's pompous.  He was in the middle of some, you know, stupid thing.  I'm like, yeah, I don't know.  He's like, wow, wow, wow.  He was furious. 
[03:17:00]  He sat there licking his lips.  Pissed off?  That's fantastic.  He was annoyed.  A good door slammer.  Nothing's better.  Well, guys, there's another kid.  I would not laugh at that.  I don't get it.  Jeff Garland got annoyed, too.  Wow.  There's another killer in the Simpson family.  Uh-oh.  You say another, like O.J. killed somebody.  There's a couple things happening in this story.  You'd think O.J. would take care of his family.  What?  I'm broke.  Well, now he's broke, but he had money for many, many years, and it seems like his brother 
[03:17:30]  was doing this job for many, many years.  Broke?  He's still...  O.J.'s loaded.  He's loaded.  The guy gets that pension money from the NFL that they can't even take money from to pay  his court bill.  Why can't they?  They're not allowed.  They cannot...  You know, he owes millions to the family.  And he cannot pay them.  He is not...  He doesn't have to pay them.  I'm not obligated to pay them with the money from his pension.  I'm an ex-football star and a wife murderer living on a pension.  I'm an ex-football star. 
[03:18:00]  I'm an ex-football star.  So O.J.'s brother crashes this bus and a passenger was killed, Anthony.  O.J. Simpson's older brother was the driver of an airport shuttle bus.  He's driving the shuttle bus.  That's like one of the worst jobs ever.  That's one of those things where they load the baggage in and take you to the terminal from the nearby hotel.  Yeah, pretty much, right?  So it crashed on a freeway, killing a passenger.  Did you know that O.J. had a brother?  No.  I didn't see him at the trial.  This is the first I've ever heard of O.J.'s brother. 
[03:18:30]  It's Melvin Leon Simpson, 58.  Melvin Leon.  Melvin Leon.  He may have fallen asleep.  Sounds like one of the temptations.  And now, Melvin Leon Simpson, live at the Apollo.  Melvin Leon Simpson, 58, may have fallen asleep at the wheel before the bus struck a guardrail Friday  and veered into a concrete support column, according to the California Highway Patrol.  Simpson was near the end of his eight-hour shift and suffering flu-like symptoms  when the 21-seat van crashed, killing 57-year-old Lynn of Phoenix. 
[03:19:00]  Wait, are you showing us his brother?  Because O.J. gave all Nicole's family jobs, and he didn't give his brother a job.  He didn't give his poor brother.  He didn't give Melvin Leon.  He didn't give Melvin a shot.  Melvin.  Poor Melvin.  Couldn't Melvin have been...  He should have been Kato, you know?  Yeah.  He let Kato live in his freaking house.  And Melvin's driving passengers from the airport.  And Melvin's crashing a bus.  What a scumbag.  Even Fred Goldman got a job as the little guy on the Monopoly cards.  Don't pass go. 
[03:19:30]  Don't say hi to your son on his birthday.  Wow.  No one ever went to, you know, Melvin Leroy Simpson.  Nobody ever said, you know, at the trial, you never heard anything about Melvin.  Never called him as a character witness?  Nothing.  Boy, they must be really on the outs, man.  Melvin might be a little slow.  Maybe Melvin did it.  Melvin.  Melvin.  Ah.  It could have been Melvin.  Oh, the whole time they could have pinned it on Melvin. 
[03:20:00]  It's Melvin.  Melvin Leon.  He showed up just to pet her hair and she screamed, give off me, retard, so he stabbed her.  Wow.  Oh, this is your football great brother.  Even back in the days, you never heard of Melvin Leon.  No one ever heard of Melvin Leon.  Wow.  Well, we've got to segue into this little thing.  We love this.  The OJ montage prank phone call thing that Kid Cristian.  Oh, I remember that.  This thing is hilarious.  Kid Crist, sort of a friend of the show, kind of. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  He got OJ's cell number and he called them many, many times.  And he put this together.  Yeah.  Oh, Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's this?  This is AC.  Let's go kill somebody tonight.  Bye.  Juice?  Yeah, hello.  OJ.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if he could help me kill her. 
[03:21:00]  What do you say, champ?  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say, you and I go kill the Spice Girls?  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing.  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk. 
[03:21:30]  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer.  OJ.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Yeah?  Juice, what's up?  Who is this?  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody?  Yeah.  Hi, OJ.  It's Kato. 
[03:22:00]  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them.  We can hold them underwater or something.  How'd it go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, OJ.  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  Yeah.  Gone.  I love that.  Isn't that the best?  OJ is laughing all the time.  The fact that he's always laughing.  He's always laughing, making, you know, oh, those are funny me killing people jokes. 
[03:22:30]  You know, I got a few myself.  God damn.  OJ, you want to kill some people?  Ha ha.  Yeah, that killing people thing.  That's the opening episode of the new show, Juice, that they're doing, which is kind of  like punked, where you go to pick up your sunglasses and you get a throat cut in the pathway.  Gotcha.  You've been juiced.  Oh, yes, I have.  You win some Bruno Mali shoes. 
[03:23:00]  No one even knew about those things.  Did you know about Bruno Mali shoes before that?  No.  Of course not.  What advertising?  What advertising?  Opie goes by, sees the shoes, throws a chocolate-covered strawberry at him.  All mad.  Anthony, remember the other day, moving back to the art thing, we were talking about what  real art is instead of the stupid gate thing?  Yeah, I made a little joke about that.  And we were talking about the dogs playing poker.  Poker playing dogs.  You've seen this thing, right, Keith?  No.  You could buy those at Walmart.  Yeah, it's a very famous painting. 
[03:23:30]  It's known as trash art.  If you're white trash, you put this in your trailer, you hang it up, the dogs playing poker,  the velvet Elvis, stuff like that.  The weird little kid-looking things with the big sad eyes, that kind of art.  That's, you know, white trash art.  Crap.  And someone asked us, you know, what we think is art, and we said, well...  I said the dogs playing poker.  That's a joke, but the original was just sold for $600,000.  $600,000 for the dogs playing poker. 
[03:24:00]  Wow.  I wouldn't pay that much to watch real dogs actually play poker.  I watched it last night.  Colin, his little hands looked like claws.  Little dog paws with those nails.  His pads were all chafed.  It was painted back in 1903.  Wow.  It's that old, huh?  And it just fetched $600,000.  That's funny.  Yeah.  But that's real art to me.  Something you look at and you can enjoy.  You look at the wall and go, look at that, his dog's playing poker. 
[03:24:30]  One's looking one way, one's looking the other.  Guy in the middle.  And then the other story we forgot to talk about today is Michael Jackson.  Ah, the front page story on the Daily News.  Yeah, the Daily News, the headline, boo-hoo, he's got the flu.  But Mike actually believes in his sick little mind that he could call in sick for court so he won't have to show up.  You know what I mean?  If he's sick, that nobody, you know, okay, forget it.  Mike is too sick.  We'll hold it off another year. 
[03:25:00]  Mike is really nuts.  He is absolutely crazy.  I think he's right when he says that he believes he's a child or because of that missing childhood that he now lives as a child.  Because this is a kid.  When you were a kid and didn't want to go to school, I have a stomachache.  I don't feel good.  That's what this idiot is doing now.  That's exactly what he's doing.  I got the flu.  I don't feel good.  I've been sniffling.  And if I blow my nose too hard, it comes off.  So I don't want to risk that. 
[03:25:30]  He's got the flu, he says.  But the fact that he's been showing up in the court, you know, going to court and he's posing, he's doing a moonwalk.  Oh, yeah.  Mike, you're on trial for touching kids.  No, him, it's an appearance.  Yeah, he thinks he's showboating.  These lunatic fans show up in front of the courtroom.  They're behind the barricades and everything.  One actually fainted.  They had to get emergency services to pick her up.  That was outside the hospital.  Oh, really?  Yeah, when Rainy Jackson was leaving after seeing Michael.  It's crazy, right?  It's like a priest showing up with communion stuff, trying to get communion out of his court here. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, like Father Shanley up there for his child molestation, handing out wine and communion wafers, shaking his mule with people, like blessing them with it.  It's the same thing.  It is.  You're on trial for that.  You put your head down, you look solemn, you walk in the building.  You don't moonwalk.  Faggot has his own umbrella carrier, he's dancing, he's taking his hat off and flipping it over like he does on stage.  You're not Jimmy Durante, you're a child rapist. 
[03:26:30]  It's like, what are you doing, man?  Jesus, at least look sorry, you know, just have something.  Look concerned that you're on trial.  No, he's posing, he's doing all sorts of moves.  Robert Blake walks to his trial, shoves spaghetti in a woman's mouth and shoots her in the head.  Yeah, why not?  But most of these, a lot of these celebrities, they're nuts.  They really are nuts. 
[03:27:00]  I don't know what it is, if he thinks he's innocent, he thinks that this is perfectly acceptable.  I said before, I really think he has this thought in his head that he is so out of place in society.  He is, you know, he went through that period of time where he was the biggest superstar ever, couldn't walk around, can't function in society.  That he believes that when he's at this Neverland, since it's within his gates, laws don't apply.  Well, he's still, he's walking like he's still a king of pop.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  You know, Thriller was how long ago? 
[03:27:30]  83.  That's a long ass time ago, Mike.  You know, maybe then you could get away with sucking a little kid off, but, you know, times they are a change.  Thriller, yeah, come on, man.  The last album is not going to get you a little boy.  No, the last album is going to get you thrown in jail.  After his story, you should start blowing 18-year-olds.  Oh, man.  So he's got a few days off on the trial. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  He thinks they're going to forget about it.  You're going to walk out.  That's what he believes.  Yeah.  I'm sick, guys.  So sick.  Sick.  Oh.  Did you see the list that the defense has?  Oh, man.  People they're going to call?  They have Kobe Bryant.  Yeah.  Kobe, they were going to call as a witness.  And Kobe, they interviewed him and said, what are they going to ask you?  And Kobe was dumbfounded.  He was just like, I don't know.  He has no clue why he's being called.  These are the well-known people that the defense are going to call.  Kobe Bryant. 
[03:28:30]  Quincy Jones.  Larry King.  Larry King.  This is a crazed person's defense.  Wow.  Diana Ross.  Strike the jury.  I want Diana Ross on there.  He wants like this.  He thinks it's a party.  He's actually sending out invitations instead of subpoenas.  He's having a Grammys party.  Yeah, it's a party.  We're going to have some champagne.  It's going to be so much fun.  He's going to hold up his little trophy.  It's an eight-year-old with tears on his face. 
[03:29:00]  Kim.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I just wanted to call in and say that I was watching the news this morning, and I heard  that they moved Michael Jackson to the fourth floor of the hospital, which also happens  to hold the pediatric unit.  Is this real or a joke?  No, this is real.  This is what I heard on the news this morning.  Roll me into the children's room.  Well, thank you, Kim.  Oh, I was delirious with fevers while you found my mouth on his little hog. 
[03:29:30]  All those sick children will turn over on their face and just take their temperature rectally  while they do little cancer coughs into a pillow.  Oh, my God.  A little shallow coughs.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  He's holding their little bald heads.  Not because of cancer, because they're too young to grow hair.  He's holding them at the soft spot.  Also on the list, Elizabeth Taylor.  Of course, Liz has to make an appearance. 
[03:30:00]  But he's got all finished celebrities.  Yeah.  None of them are doing anything.  Stevie Wonder as a witness?  What did he say?  Nothing.  I didn't see nothing.  When Michael was around children, did you ever hear lapping sounds?  I arrest my case.  Stevie Wonder?  Oh, man.  Let's see.  Is Webster on the list?  No.  Webster was a good buddy of his.  Also on the list, David Blaine, the magician.  Please make this all disappear, David.  Just go away. 
[03:30:30]  I'm going to close my eyes and tap my heels three times.  Make it go away.  You think Mike is going?  You think he's going in?  No.  I don't know.  You don't think he's going in?  He's a rich celebrity, man.  It seems so like you could never imagine him in Oz, you know?  You can't imagine him in prison.  How much money would you pay to see Mike in the weight room?  Oh, would that be great?  I'd have a penitentiary.  Just walking around the prison weight room, playing hoops in the yard.  I think this is the thing that would revive his career. 
[03:31:00]  A good stint in prison would, I think it would be the one that helps his creativity.  Yeah.  Comes out, a new man, all buff.  Buffed up.  Yeah.  Pumped up.  Some prison tattoos.  He's black again.  You're like, oh man, Mike is back.  Here's my new album, motherfucker.  I'm Michael Jackson.  Yeah, deep voice.  Whoa.  Y'all bitches think I'm playing?  Also on the list is that, how do you say his name? 
[03:31:30]  Deepak, Deepak.  Deepak Shakura, whatever.  Chopra.  Yeah, Chopra.  Shakura.  What are these people called for?  What does that do again?  Tupac?  No, no, no.  This is the guy who's a...  Spiritual.  Chopra.  He's big in LA.  Chopra.  Right, right.  Also, Steve Harvey.  Steve, yeah.  Steve likes that Mike a lot.  Wow.  Nick Carter.  Not from BCN.  No, Nick Carter.  Of the Backstreet Boys.  Maury Povich, Anthony's on the line.  Maury.  What is Maury going to say? 
[03:32:00]  Bring Michael some progeria kids.  Most of these people are like 70, 80 years old.  Get the kids.  Get some kids that can testify for it.  That'll help them more.  Yeah, where are the kids that were at Neverland?  Come on.  Well, this is for the defense.  Yeah, the prosecutor's going to parade a few of them.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying get the kids who can, you know, vouch for some celebrity kids.  Prosecution's witness list looks like Romper Room.  Bob McAllister's going to be the judge.  Little joke, can you put the rattler down? 
[03:32:30]  Speak into the microphone.  Lawyer just goes up there with a mirror with no glasses.  I like to call Billy, Johnny, and Petey, and Bob.  Every question is going to be answered.  How many times did he rape you?  This many.  And then finally, Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino owner.  What the hell is he going to be?  I don't understand his witness list.  It's ridiculous. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's a witness.  He's gone.  He's going to jail.  Mike is gone.  It's awful.  What about Geraldo?  His biggest fan these days, Geraldo Rivera.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Fox News.  They have him on all the time.  And the reason Fox is doing it and Geraldo is doing this is for ratings.  They know people are going to tune in because Michael's very candid when he goes on Geraldo.  But Geraldo's actually defending him.  Michael, when I see you with the children, I understand that that's the real Michael Jackson.  Yeah, that's why he's going on trial. 
[03:33:30]  That is the real Michael.  But the thing is, Mike, he acts like a guy who couldn't help himself with the kid sleeping in his bed and all.  That's how you know he has a problem because he couldn't help himself.  It's like, I got it.  I got it.  But he will never say that.  He thinks there's nothing wrong with it.  He's trying to say, by inviting sick children to Neverland to go on these rides and look at the animals, he's being a great guy.  That's fine.  If he was just doing that, that is a great guy.  Any of these accusations that came up, you'd have things in place that would protect you. 
[03:34:00]  You'd have chaperones.  You'd have guards, whatever it is, to protect yourself against something like that happening.  But that's not the case.  No.  He's helping a bunch of kids out, but he's picking the ones he likes, bringing them up into his secret room.  The weak little weak kids.  I'm like a lion on a plane to the Serengeti.  I see a limping zebra.  I've got to stick my mule in it.  Well, you know what happened was the kid said, only put it in halfway and don't pump.  And Michael had a pump. 
[03:34:30]  He had to.  He had to.  He had to at that point.  Oh, God damn.  Hey, getting back to that, what was that other story you were telling?  I don't want to give away the punchline about...  Oh, he didn't finish the story about when he was in lockup.  Yeah, no, you told the story when we were in commercial and we were laughing really hard.  After the McDonald's?  The McDonald's.  Oh, oh, when the cops had me on the ground.  Is this another story?  No, this is the same story.  I just forgot when I said, you know, to hell with pepper spray. 
[03:35:00]  I eat pepper spray.  They emptied a can of pepper spray in my eyes.  And then another cop gave me a nice cop boot right in the gut.  I had McDonald's earlier.  My stomach was rumbling.  You know how you have that little rumbling and little light farts?  And he kicked poop right out of my head.  So I'd go in the cellar with the other, you know, guys in the cellar and be like, who stinks?  Man, did you shit yourself?  Oh, you were the guy that shit himself in lockup. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, man, that was bad.  Yeah, they wanted me out of there, man.  And the cops hated me so much, they wouldn't let me wash up.  Of course not.  That's gold for them guys.  Oh, they took me to the hospital.  Making you sick your own crap.  They took me to the hospital, and the most beautiful, you know, nurse, she was like,  ooh, he stinks.  I could hear her as she left the room.  This guy stinks.  You know, no shot.  If you stink of crap because you've crapped yourself, you pretty much ruined your shot with the chick.  Yeah.  I'm in cuffs and I shit my pants, but I'd love to take you out when this is over. 
[03:36:00]  That's great.  Keith, you're hilarious today, man.  I love it.  Should we take a break, I guess?  Yeah, we'll take a quick one and then come back.  Yeah, maybe we can take a long break.  So maybe we could, yeah, take some leaks and stuff.  Kevin Kennedy was supposed to call in.  Is that happening today?  Kevin Kennedy.  From, you know, the new channel on XM, Major League Baseball.  I forgot the name of the channel already.  Home Play 175.  Home Play 175, that's right.  How can you talk about, what's his name? 
[03:36:30]  I think they had Jose Canseco on yesterday, right?  Yeah.  We've got to talk to Kevin Kennedy.  He's ratting everybody out, man.  But he's lying like a champion.  You think he's lying?  Yeah, he's exaggerating a little bit.  Maybe exaggerating, but I don't think he's lying.  Because the guy kept asking him, referring back to his book, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that.  Yeah, okay.  Like he didn't remember anything.  Oh, the 60 Minutes interview?  Yeah, the 60 Minutes interview.  He kind of tripped him up.  He said, yeah, there were a bunch of times that he shot up, what's his name, McGuire in the ass.  McGuire, yeah.  In the ass with the steroids. 
[03:37:00]  Shot him in the ass.  McGuire's big red ass.  Oh, God damn.  Speaking of Mark McGuire, where do I get the steroids is all I need to know.  You see his wife?  If this is what you get when you do steroids, where do I begin?  There's a picture of Mark McGuire with his wife in all the papers in New York today.  This woman is perfect.  She has the big, tall, blonde, big boobs.  She looks like a stripper.  Unbelievable.  You think he shot her in the ass with steroids?  Yeah, give her some of it. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, I'd like to do something to you.  I learned it in a men's room bathroom with Jose Canseco.  I'm changing my opinion, though, man.  I think steroids are good.  Look what you get.  Look what you get if you're on the steroids.  I guess they're going to be in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.  Because they do that every year.  They get the athletes with their hot wives in there.  Wow.  She sure fits.  A couple shoots.  It's depressing.  Athletes and their stupid wives.  Why don't they show comedians, hookers, and fat girls? 
[03:38:00]  And Bonnie.  Stop it.  Bonnie's hot.  But you want to see the fat pigs that come to the cellar and just want to hang out and look at us at the next table over?  Oh, yeah.  They just show up and just look.  And it's just a sign of my pitiful career.  All these years of the business, I get a fat girl just staring at the table.  That's what they do.  Comic groupies are really bad.  They're awful.  I've seen my buddy Adam Ferrara.  You know, and Adam's a good-looking guy.  Women really seem to be attracted to him and stuff. 
[03:38:30]  He was playing out at Governor's.  And we all go back to the bar afterwards, have a couple of beers.  And the line of girls that came up.  And there were hot girls in the place.  Not one of them.  There was a line of fat chicks waiting to get an autograph.  Can I kiss you on the cheek?  And Adam's just standing there like, you know, oh, God.  I could get, you know, looking at the girls walking out.  Her, her, her.  And look at the slobs that come up. 
[03:39:00]  And he's so nice and, you know, cordial to him.  Hey, thanks.  And they walk away.  Oh, slob.  They're wearing tube tops to her back.  Looks like a sharpie's neck.  Big pieces of fat you can just hold on to and move her head up and down.  Move her shoulder blade fat right down to the middle of her back.  Back up to her head.  All around.  A little mess.  That's what it is, man.  Unless you're like Jim Carrey level. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, you've got to get your superstar level.  That's movie star, though.  You're not just a stand-up anymore.  That's, you know, movie star, but.  You've really got to get to another level.  Got to get out of the cellar, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Oof.  In a big way.  Host the Oscars someday.  That's a good sign.  Chris Rock's doing it.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll finish up the Opie and Anthony program next.  Thank you. 
[03:40:00]  That's the real deal.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  That's the real deal.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  Dance, motherfuckers. 
[03:40:30]  Dance, motherfuckers.  Dance, motherfuckers.  Dance, motherfuckers.  começate, motherfuckers.  Dance, motherfuckers.  I want to hear some music, man 
[03:41:00]  Shut, shut, shut your face  I want to hear some music, man  I want to hear some music, man  Shut your face  I want to hear some music, man  I know  Who is this party?  Who is this party?  Who is this party?  Who is this party?  Hey! 
[03:41:30]  Ah!  Oh, okay, terrific  Hey!  Oh, okay, oh, okay  Ha, ha, ha, ha  I like it 
[03:42:00]  Give my mind off me  I like it  I like it  Give the fire to me  I like it  I like it  Give the fire to me  Take it in  That's the real deal 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, that's what we do  That's the real deal  That's the shit  That's the real deal  Yeah, that's what we do  That's the real deal  That's the shit  That's the real deal  Yes, that's what it is  That's the shit 
[03:43:00]  You, you, you, you  We'll be right back. 
[03:43:30]  And they do this, of course, because having everybody drive the same speed on the same road just doesn't make sense. 
[03:44:00]  I'm surprised they make them drive the same direction.  How about you?  I couldn't spell when I was a little kid.  I couldn't spell.  So my parents got all concerned. 
[03:44:30]  So they went down to the toy store.  They bought me a little red box called Speak and Spell.  You remember that?  Speak and Spell?  They shouldn't have called it Speak and Spell, but they should have called it Speak like the Devil.  Remember the voice?  A-E-I-L-O.  What was that?  A-B-C.  That thing was evil.  A-L-A-N.  That thing would wake me in the middle of the night, like two in the morning.  Play with me.  Get up. 
[03:45:00]  I want to spell right now.  I'm eight years old.  I spell great.  I talk like a freak.  I'm like, Mom, something is wrong.  Something is W-R-I-N-G.  You are...  Mmm.  Mmm. 
[03:45:30]  XM202.  Dan in Minneapolis.  What's up, Dan?  Eh, I just wanted to say you guys are doing a hell of a job.  Like, uh...  Thanks.  I got into a little accident.  You got to...  You got...  You got...  I have no idea what you're saying, because he's not really playing along here.  And he's still talking, and we're trying to help him out. 
[03:46:00]  This isn't Marvin Luther, is it?  I don't know.  Got into an accident?  He's still talking.  Marvin Luther.  And we're talking over him.  What's that name?  What's OJ's brother's name?  I couldn't explain it.  Melvin?  Melvin?  That's every...  Melvin?  Melvin Leon.  Leon?  Marvin Luther?  Marvin Luther?  Marvin Luther Simpson Jr.?  Melvin Leon King.  It's a holiday.  First Monday in February, you flip a bus and kill someone.  Dan, I don't know what you said, so... 
[03:46:30]  I think you like the program, though.  He likes the show.  Thanks, Dan.  All right.  Well, that was a waste of time.  And then we got this idiot.  We always had these idiots.  Guinness, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, little Jimmy.  Hi, Guinness.  Hey, I want to know when you guys are going to get some women up there and have a good  little contest, like a wiffle ball bat, a 55-gallon drum challenge.  Ooh, remember that one?  Oh, I used to love it, man.  I remember you guys back in Boston.  That stinks, though, the 55-gallon drum.  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  Remember how bad the studio smelled?  We actually had to take Vicks and put it under our nose like there were dead bodies in the  studio.  Yeah, that was awful.  The smell was horrendous.  And then we almost got in trouble because a girl, a cricket, went in a girl's ear.  And what we did was we used to take about five or eight 55-gallon drums.  It started out as the serial killer challenge, by the way.  And then it turned into the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Then you had the girls running across the street to the hotel, which looked like a crime  theme.  Well, we would take girls, put them in 55-gallon drums, seal the top up. 
[03:47:30]  They'd be in bikinis.  Or no, their underwear.  It was their underwear.  And then we would just take the most heinous stuff and throw it into these barrels.  Living insects, living eels, snakes, food products made out of just bellies of cows,  intestines, lungs.  We invented hissing cockroaches.  The big hissing.  We were the first ones to use the hissing cockroaches.  And they hissed.  They became a staple on Fear Factor.  But we found the hissing cockroaches a long time ago.  A bag of crickets.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's what got us in trouble. 
[03:48:00]  That's what got us in trouble with that goddamn event.  You know what we should do?  Maybe tomorrow, if it's not too hard, get some of the reactions when we're dumping stuff  into the 55-gallon drum.  Yeah, the screams that would come out of these barrels.  If it's too much work, forget it.  But the screams that would come from these barrels.  Remember the big eels that were flopping and hitting the barrel and we're trying to  get them into the barrels and they're just losing their minds or whatever?  A girl's screaming in horror.  You get a girl screaming in horror with that muffled, echoey sound of a barrel.  It's fantastic. 
[03:48:30]  Pig's blood.  Yeah, we'd pour pig's blood in on these girls and then we poured the crickets in.  One cricket crawled in a girl's ear and wouldn't come out.  She couldn't get it out.  So she had to go to the hospital to get it taken out.  Meanwhile, we take her out of the barrel.  She's covered in pig blood and in her underwear.  Now, the emergency guys come upstairs, put her on a stretcher to take her down because  I guess that's just standard procedure.  They're trying to get the cricket out of her ear.  Couldn't, so they decide they're going to take her down to the hospital.  They didn't know what was going on.  They were ready to call the cops.  Well, they bring her through the lobby of the building and here's this girl head to toe 
[03:49:00]  covered in blood in her underwear coming out of our studio.  Hi!  Yopi and Anthony show.  Enjoy!  That really did not bode well with the security of the building.  No, man, she must have smelled too stuff on her.  Awful.  It was a great bit.  Like she got kicked in the guts with a stomach full of McDonald's.  I'll get another question for you.  We'll try to get some audio of that tomorrow, but before you go on to the next question,  something that is pretty good for the new listeners, instead of us redoing that show, 
[03:49:30]  you go to oavirus.com and Ed over there, FedEx, whatever.  He does a great job updating that site all the time with a lot of the bits we talk about.  So I'm sure if you do a quick search, you can find the 55-gallon drum challenge shows.  And when you know we had a bad show one day, maybe go to oavirus.com and check out one of the old shows.  Sometimes it's not worth trying it again.  That's what it is.  If the situation comes up where we get a bunch of girls that want crap poured on them,  maybe we'll do it again. 
[03:50:00]  But sometimes you can't get them through Master Pose security checkpoint anyway.  Yeah, well, a lot of the great old shows are on oavirus.com, some classics.  Did y'all ever have transvestite wrestling?  Transvestite wrestling?  Yeah, I think that's a new hint of something.  I've been involved in it, but not in a radio base.  Put a lipstick camera in Jim's car.  You were trying to get your money back when you made a gender error?  A gender error. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  I didn't lie, motherfucker.  You made the assumption.  Hey, guys, I was surfing around the Internet last night,  and I came across this website, eatabullet.com,  and I saw Jimmy's playing in Houston this week.  But when's he going to come to, like, Providence or Boston?  I'm doing Boston.  Tickets, I think, went on sale today.  The Comedy Connection in April.  I have to find out.  Actually, I just booked Boston.  I just booked Atlantic City.  So I will let you know tomorrow. 
[03:51:00]  But I think Boston went on sale today at the Comedy Connection for April 8, 9, or if one, too.  I think it's April 8, 9, in Boston.  All right.  Thanks, Guinness.  Hey, have a good night.  Pops out.  Thanks.  All righty.  Silence.  Yeah, I know.  I was reading.  It was kind of nice for a second.  Isn't that good?  Sometimes it's just a moment of reflection.  All right.  I guess we can start playing.  What did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show?  I was hoping to talk to Kevin Kennedy.  What happened with that? 
[03:51:30]  We're going to have to reschedule, I guess?  Yes.  We had that big interview yesterday on the debut of the Major League Baseball channel with  Jose Canseco.  I want to see what that was all about.  What did Jose say?  Did he say anything?  Well, we got clips that we can maybe play really fast.  I don't know.  Is there anything on here that looks interesting, Anthony?  Well, the benefits of steroids?  You know what?  Interesting.  I was always like, okay, you always hear about the superstar players on steroids.  What about the bum players? 
[03:52:00]  The players with a 122 average?  Nobody ever busts the bum players.  No one's saying, hey, you're on steroids.  They just skip through.  Imagine how much you'd suck if you weren't on steroids.  Little League.  You're catching brain cancer for a 180 average.  That has got to be the worst, you know?  That's great.  Old raisin nuts for nothing.  You know there's somebody out there like that.  I just want to find that guy.  Why is this working for me? 
[03:52:30]  You sneeze, a little brain matter comes out of your ear.  Old pudding skull.  So you can say, go touching your ass for nothing.  He shot me the ass.  I got nothing to show for.  Okay.  Play with the fact that people viewing story too negatively.  Yeah, he's being called on the carpet because he's kind of saying steroids are good in some cases.  And the kids might get the wrong idea. 
[03:53:00]  Well, I think they're great.  I do too.  After seeing Mark McGuire's wife, I have a whole new appreciation for the steroids.  So if you're listening, kids, feel free.  Steroids are okay.  Mommy and Daddy are wrong.  Take them as soon as you can.  Steroids endorsed by the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  We should pump some steroids into this show.  No, I don't think we need it.  Pump it into the phones this morning.  Yeah. 
[03:53:30]  Well, listen to the replay.  You're going to love that.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, have fun with the first hour of this mess.  It's us bitching about the phones.  And if that isn't bad enough, you'll hear Mr. Roboto at the end of it all.  But I guarantee that the show gets more good after the first 50 minutes.  So just bear with the first 50.  Or go to, I don't know, go do an errand or something.  Start listening around 7.  Oh, wait, we have to do the other thing.  Oh, we can't do that because then it's like time zone all over the place. 
[03:54:00]  Whatever.  You'll figure it out.  50 minutes in.  50 minutes in, you can start listening.  It gets better.  Keith Robinson killed.  Oh, man.  He's still here, but we can promote that Keith Robinson killed on the show today.  I had a good time here, man.  It was great.  A lot of fun, man.  It's Black History Month.  It's one of my funniest in Black History Month.  That's why you're here.  You think you're coming back next time?  No, I won't be here.  See you guys next February.  Next week.  March, it's done.  One month a year, we humor you guys. 
[03:54:30]  The other 11 are for Whitey.  Whitey.  Well, I don't know.  Should we try to get into these clips?  We've only got a couple minutes.  I just want to, I don't know, I guess.  Which one do you want to hear?  The one on benefits of steroids?  Benefits of steroids.  What track number?  That'll help Derek in the booth.  Is it 15?  There's so many numbers on it.  15?  All right, let's listen to this.  It's quick.  When you're injured, you can recuperate a lot faster from steroid use.  And it's a great confidence booster.  You're actually stronger where a season is 162 games. 
[03:55:00]  Then you've got spring training.  Playoffs and World Series.  You talk about well over 200 games.  So one of the major factors is fatigue and muscle wear and tear.  And steroids done properly can cut that down in half.  Hey, he's doing a commercial for steroids.  Telling the truth.  That is great.  Let's go to track 16 because this is what I was wondering, why he would name names.  It makes the book more viable, more interesting.  It makes it real.  I named myself also in there. 
[03:55:30]  It's a true story of my life and everyone that was involved in it.  And I think that the public, the fans, they want to know who was involved.  Hey, Anthony, we can have the exclusive interview with Jose Canseco.  Oh, you want to do it the way that they actually use these guys?  There are radio guys.  Mancow is very guilty of this.  Really?  These are the type of things like they do the basic interview.  And then these hack jocks from all over the country will get the sound bites and then make believe they interviewed them.  They cut themselves in.  They cut themselves in.  So you would ask the question, and then Jose Canseco gives the answer, and it sounds like you're doing the exclusive. 
[03:56:00]  Now, Jose, people are – this is track 19.  Got to play with that.  Yeah, you better tell them what track it is to ask a question.  He's just – Jose, people are viewing your story a little too negatively.  What do you have to say about that?  These players do not try to hurt the game.  They do not try to hurt any individuals.  If anything, worst-case scenario, if they're doing these steroids improperly, they're hurting themselves,  but they're not hurting anyone else.  They're just trying to set up their families financially as much as possible. 
[03:56:30]  They're trying to create more longevity in the game for them.  They're trying to become more of a well-known athlete.  They're trying to help their team win by becoming a better athlete.  So I think people are just looking at this too negatively.  Oh.  Well, that didn't work.  Can I try one?  Yeah, you try one.  All right, track 13.  I'm going to cue that one up.  Okay.  Jose, aren't you afraid by naming names in this book that people are going to come out and maybe sue you? 
[03:57:00]  I truly believe these individuals do try to sue me.  I think they're going to be making a monstrous mistake because the truth will definitely, definitely come out then.  Yeah.  They don't want to push me to the wall.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Jose, a lot of this stuff goes behind closed doors, right?  Major League Baseball itself isn't really going to do anything,  and a player association isn't really going to do anything until Congress comes and steps in.  Congress will have to do a major investigation and put a stop to that. 
[03:57:30]  And the once responsible, everybody wants to blame the player.  You're calling me out to drive, you bastard.  It's track 14.  Let me try this again, you son of a bitch, Derek.  Are you about to track 14?  That was the Congress thing.  Track 14 is what Lady Di's husband was standing on.  Nice call, man.  Jose, we're hearing a lot of this stuff goes on behind closed doors.  It's part of the game. 
[03:58:00]  These are things that are kept in-house, never really spoken about outside the clubhouse.  I mean, how many things go on back there that, believe me, fans and managers sometimes,  they have no idea.  Hey, can I ask a question for track, oh, no, track 8?  Okay.  Hey, Jose, a lot of people say that you're a dirty Puerto Rican.  Why don't you talk about Sosa and Mac?  Everybody wants to blame the players and this and that.  But, you know what, the owners knew.  They all turned their heads to it.  They didn't care.  As long as they weren't making money, Players Association knew. 
[03:58:30]  Don Fear and all these guys, they all knew what was going on.  They just turned a blind eye to it and said, hey, you know, the game's developing again.  It's growing.  You know, the Sammy Sosa, Mark McGuire show.  They were both juiced.  No way for much about it.  04, track 4.  Jose, when you're slugging your wife in the face because of steroid use,  is there another way to go about using the steroids so you don't do that?  There is a right way and there is a wrong way to do steroids. 
[03:59:00]  If you're going to do steroids, please seek professional help.  Obviously, this stuff is illegal.  You have to get prescriptions for it.  You have to get medical supervision.  You have to have the right doctors.  You have to have the right blood testing.  Do not go behind closed doors with your friends and use dirty needles and start injecting yourselves  and start guessing at what dosage your body should use.  That's what I thought.  That's when you get into big trouble.  Yeah.  I think the steroid issue has, you know, been so misunderstood and left behind closed doors. 
[03:59:30]  Oh, one more thing.  Program complete.  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  I'm John Lewis.
