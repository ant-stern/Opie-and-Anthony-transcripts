<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Opie's infamous "sports curse," a running gag where his sports predictions consistently lead to losses for those who bet on them.  Numerous callers recounted significant winnings from betting *against* Opie's picks, with amounts ranging from $200 to $4000.  Audio clips from previous shows highlighted Opie's confidently incorrect predictions.  This segment transitioned into enthusiastic listener feedback on Jim Norton's HBO special, "Monster Rain," with Norton himself present in the studio to react to the praise and discuss the upcoming DVD release.  Other briefly touched-upon topics included Opie's purported proximity to Kathleen Turner, speculation about Don Imus's possible radio return, extensive, vulgar commentary on paparazzi photos of Britney Spears, and a listener's anecdote about being woken by a leaf blower.  The $1000 daily contest was promoted throughout, interwoven with ongoing discussion of the "sports curse."

The next segment began with humorous, crude comments on E-Rock's appearance and performance, followed by Opie's graphic account of a sewage backup in his bathroom, fueled by speculation, including the possibility of Kathleen Turner's involvement.  The main focus shifted to a rumor from the New York Radio Message Board, posted by "Alan Sniffin," that the show might be dropped from WYSP in Philadelphia.  The hosts speculated on the reasons, focusing on the new program director's lack of communication and criticizing the over-reliance on research in radio programming.  A recurring listener contest to identify a sound resulted in aggressive, mocking interactions with callers deemed "contest pigs," particularly Bernadette, who faced extended teasing for her repeated failures.  The segment included discussions of Doug Stanhope's upcoming shows, Don Imus's return, and news stories involving nooses and racial slurs, sparking debate on their interpretation and classification as hate crimes.  A humorous "mother update" from staff member Dan concluded this section, followed by a discussion of a Star Wars-themed trumpet player video.

The following segment started with crude humor regarding a previous segment about nooses, delving into discussions of hate crimes, free speech, and the subjective nature of hate.  The conversation moved to a negative trick-or-treating experience, contrasted with those of underprivileged children, then to a viral video of a terrible Star Wars-themed trumpet performance.  Doug Stanhope joined in studio during this portion.  Further discussion covered a dentist accused of groping patients who claimed breast massages were a legitimate dental procedure, Don Imus's return, past show controversies, a listener's negative experience at a classic rock concert, and a lengthy anecdote about a past encounter with Sting and The Police, promoting their underwhelming projects.  The segment ended with continued discussion of The Police and a caller's preference for 80s thrash metal.

A later segment focused on a rambling discussion about 80s music, particularly the perceived "gayness" of various artists and music videos.  Opie, Anthony, and an unidentified co-host offensively critiqued videos by Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Whitesnake, Journey, Billy Squire, the Pet Shop Boys, Mick Jagger and David Bowie, and Right Said Fred.  The conversation unexpectedly shifted to childhood discipline and ADHD, including a phone interview with Dr. Adam Cox, author of "No Mind Left Behind," about over-medication.  This discussion was punctuated by sexually explicit jokes and tangents, mentions of Wonder Mike (of the Sugarhill Gang) from a past TV appearance, and audio clips of 70s "audio porn."

The final segment featured a continuation of the phone interview with Dr. Adam Cox, which remained highly sexually explicit and offensive, frequently targeting Dr. Cox and making light of Down syndrome.  The hosts questioned Dr. Cox about "super kids" and the hypothetical prevention of ADHD children, and discussed parenting styles, ADHD medication, and the prevalence of ADHD.  The call was chaotic due to interruptions from other callers, who also used offensive language.  The segment concluded with a song about a child with special needs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Testing 1, 2, 1, 2.  Poe, Poe, Boo, Boe, Banana, Nana.  Banana, Fanna, Foe, Foe, Fee, Fi, Momo.  Poe!  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were partying with?  Steelers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff, and they just threw him in a dumpster in London. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left him there.  I think it's pretty funny.  No one wants to get rock star.  This is where entertainment is going.  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one, to feel his manhand  holding your head like the sweat of a manhand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst.  The worst show I saw.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Rock and roll.  Good morning.  Hi.  What's up, Anthony?  Let's begin another week of hijinks.  Ah, that's what we do.  Fun and hijinks.  Oh, my God. 
[00:02:00]  Easiest money that could ever have been made.  I certainly hope everyone took my advice, took the kids' college money, took the mortgage  money, the car payment money, the money for the wife's surgery, whatever, no matter how  important that cash was.  I certainly hope you took my advice and put every single penny on the Eagles over the weekend because, my God, it was an absolute lock with the points. 
[00:02:30]  The sports curse, the sports curse, it was a complete bloodbath for me, for me over the weekend.  I picked nine games.  I picked a few football games.  I picked the playoff baseball game.  I picked the hockey game.  I was two for nine.  And the two games I won, I don't even know because it was part of the football picks and they were throwaway games. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I'll take the Chiefs.  Yeah, it wasn't.  I'll take the Packers.  Nothing you cared about.  Just because I kind of like Brett Favre.  Who cares?  Brett Favre.  But the other games, I had passion behind.  I had a reason why I was picking them.  Yep.  I lost all of them.  Who is not believing in the sports curse at this point?  Anthony put down a thousand bucks on the Eagles.  Oh, yeah.  He told all of Philly to do the same.  I told everybody in the country. 
[00:03:30]  It had to just be, I mean, look at this.  Misfit is saying, I made four grand.  Thanks, Opie.  People made money.  Look, here it is.  Mike in Queens, what's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Me?  Yeah, let's go, Mike.  Yeah, Mike Jersey, doesn't matter.  All right.  Hey, this is Mike from Sussex, and I just won $1,000 courtesy of the Opie's sports curse.  Wada-doodle.  People, I pleaded with you.  Brooklyn.  Yes. 
[00:04:00]  Brooklyn Ace, Faith Wissner.  Congratulations, Anthony.  I knew on Friday that you had it.  I was the last one to tell Opie not to do it, and he had to.  But what are you going to do?  Thanks, Opie.  I really appreciated that yesterday.  It wasn't one of those things where no matter what team he says, they're absolutely going  to win or lose or anything like that.  But when you were so passionate about the Jets, and they're your team, and you said that they 
[00:04:30]  were going to win, that I knew.  Well, Jets at home need a big win.  They need any kind of win at this point.  And it wasn't like you were saying it like, oh, I want to show you how this sports curse  works.  You legitimately wanted the Jets to win.  Yeah.  You had them picked to win.  Yeah.  And that's when I just knew.  I sensed it.  It's time to strike.  Wait.  You know, here's actual audio from Friday's show. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, okay.  This is audio from Friday's show.  Don't be confused.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  Check this out from Friday.  Got to take the Jets over the Eagles.  I'm sorry.  You have to.  Sorry, Philly.  Jets at home.  Got to do it.  Why would you do that?  I have to.  You bet with your heart.  It really is.  All right.  All right.  Look, look, look.  I'm suggesting to everybody right now.  Got to take the Jets.  Right now.  Got to take the Jets.  I don't care if all you have left is money for your children's food.  Bet against the Jets.  I'm just telling you.  If it's your mortgage payment, your car payment, I don't care what money you have socked away 
[00:05:30]  somewhere for the most important thing in your life.  Take it and bet against the Jets.  You won't regret it.  That was from Friday's show.  That was Friday's show.  We are back live.  That's how absolutely sure I was of this sports curse and Opie with especially the Jets.  And for the most part, when we talk sports, Anthony kind of just hangs.  Yeah.  You know, you jump in when you can, whatever.  But for the most part, you just kind of hang. 
[00:06:00]  Sports, you don't have that same passion as you have for like Hitler.  No.  I'm not a big sports guy.  Nice choice of comparison.  But for the most part, we all have what we're passionate about.  Sports, you know, you can hang with anyone talking about sports, but it's not your number  one thing.  Right.  But when it came to the sports curse and me picking teams on Friday, you jumped on it.  I had to.  Going back to Friday's show, more audio, talking about, you know, putting as much money as  possible down on the Eagles over the Jets. 
[00:06:30]  Here's from Friday.  Philly still hates me because of the Philly, you know, curse.  Yes.  The sports curse.  But I really did want the Phillies to win it all this year.  So this was a tough decision here, and I have to go with the Jets at home.  How do I bet on football?  I swear to you, I got to get into that.  I got to bet against the Jets.  Go $1,000 right now.  I'm going, I'll go $1,000.  Go $1,000.  I would absolutely bet $1,000 on Philly.  I might know a bookie or two.  How much you got? 
[00:07:00]  Give me, I'll give you a grand.  All right, give me a grand.  I want one G.  Give me a grand, and I'll make sure the bookie gets the money.  One G on the Eagles.  Absolutely.  All right.  Absolutely.  How many points?  How many points?  What's the spread?  I think the Eagles are favored by three, if I'm not mistaken.  All right, that's three and a half.  No problem.  I bet $25.  Wow.  You're going to bet $1,000?  I'm good for $1,000 on the Eagles.  And we're back live on this fine Monday morning.  Anthony won $1,000.  It couldn't have been easier.  And the Eagles did, you know. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, they covered.  They covered the spread there as well.  And then we move on to Brad in Boston.  Brad, what's up?  Opie.  Yeah.  I love you guys.  Love the show.  Could you just do me a favor?  Maybe please say, like, go Cleveland one time in the broadcast.  Oh, no.  Oh, did I watch that game.  Oh, did I enjoy that 11th inning.  Let's not forget, I also was all about the Sox this weekend.  Yeah.  You can't just change it.  See, Brad thinks you could change it just by saying, Opie, root for the Indians. 
[00:08:00]  Opie wants Boston to win.  Don't you understand this?  He's not rooting for a team because he wants them to lose.  He actually likes Boston, loves the city, loves the people, and wants the team to win.  Me being more of a Yankee fan, I don't like Boston, the Red Sox, and I don't want them to win.  I see them just come apart at the seams in that 11th inning and watch every pitcher just coughing up these great pitches that are just flying out of the park. 
[00:08:30]  It was 13-6, the final after 11 innings, and after, what, five and a half hours of baseball?  Oh, yeah, it was a lot of baseball there.  Where people had frostbite at the stadium at Fenway?  Yeah.  You see how cold they looked up there?  They certainly did.  But it was a Red Sox loss in extra innings.  I hate the Yankees.  My Mets are out, obviously.  And then, you know, my second favorite National League team, the Phillies, out.  So I got to go Sox. 
[00:09:00]  Said it on Friday.  You know, they did win, what, Friday?  Yeah.  But they should have taken two at home.  They won, yeah.  And then Saturday, 13-6.  Yikes.  Yeah, that was a little rough.  And it was tied up at the beginning of the 11th.  And then, oopsie.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's go to Kelly in Boston.  Kelly.  Hi.  Hi.  Thank you so much for betting against the Pats.  I really appreciate it.  You're a big Pats fan?  Huge Pats fan.  Yeah, congratulations.  Because I did pick the Cowboys at home. 
[00:09:30]  And the Cowboys came back for a little while.  I was starting to not even doubt the sports curse.  I wasn't.  I didn't doubt it.  I absolutely knew.  I was watching that game going, I knew two minutes in that the Cowboys were going to lose.  I had no doubt.  You've got to be kidding me.  It is uncanny.  If you don't believe me, here's some more audio from Friday's Opie and Anthony show.  This is from Friday.  Don't be confused.  Here's the biggie.  Here's the biggie.  You've got the Pats and the Cowboys both undefeated. 
[00:10:00]  We all know that.  We've got the Cowboys at home.  Jimmy's team.  Oh, here's another one.  Jimmy's team.  Here's another one.  Not America's team.  Jimmy's team.  Before this pick goes down, I would like to apologize to the city I'm not really fond of,  the people from, Boston.  I just have.  Go ahead.  Say it.  Say go, Pats, go.  Come on.  Say it.  I actually am going with the Cowboys.  Whoa!  Sincerely.  Yes, look.  It circled and everything.  Why?  Wow.  Okay, he did. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  Good luck for you.  Cowboys at home.  That's the advantage right there, my friend.  Boston.  Cowboys over the Pats.  Mm-hmm.  Bank on it!  Nice.  Bank on it!  We'll see how I did on Monday.  I was actually saying Patriots against my own team, hoping that you would.  Yeah.  And here we are back live on Monday, and I said Bank on it, and Ed knows usually I would  go Pats.  That's why I was sure you were going to say Pats.  I was feeling good about the Cowboys at home.  I was stunned when you said the Cowboys, but then once you said it, I'm like, all right, 
[00:11:00]  Pats win.  Pats win.  And E-Rock has this from Friday as well, let's not forget.  By the way, go Sox go.  I haven't forgotten.  Let's go Sox.  It's something.  Dude, I was actually hiding in my apartment yesterday.  It was getting creepy.  Because the only two games I did win, I'm not kidding, they were throwaway, I flipped  a coin, basically.  I took the Chiefs, and I took the Packers. 
[00:11:30]  Who cares?  No passion for the teams.  I don't care about either one of those teams.  Yeah.  And then let's go to Marcus in Montana.  Marcus, what's up?  Hey, thanks, Opie.  I won 200 bucks on the Flyers-Islanders game.  Well, let's not forget hockey.  Why would we want to forget that?  Opie's the Islanders.  Yeah.  Oh, I can't believe the money that's rolling in.  Opie's picks.  The mob is going to kidnap Opie and throw him in a room and just ask him who he thinks 
[00:12:00]  is going to win certain games.  Well, it is true.  It is true.  I traveled down to Philly Saturday for the big Flyers home opener.  I was in the box with the fine staff.  Goodness gracious, Opie's in the box.  I was with the WIP crew down there in Philly watching the Islanders and the Flyers go at  it.  It was a really, really close game.  But the Flyers prevailed, won their home opener over my Islanders.  I did pick the Islanders as well. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  By the way, I picked a lot of home teams and a lot of home teams lost over the weekend.  Obviously, the Islanders were on the road.  You know, that one, the Flyers probably should have won.  I don't know.  But, you know, I went with the Islanders.  Ugh.  Wow.  And then, of course, it continued with the Dolphins.  I took the Dolphins.  Yes, you did.  I know they're having a horrible year.  They haven't won a game in like nine losses in a row going back to last year. 
[00:13:00]  But for Big Ken.  What were they home?  They were home, too?  I'm not sure if they were.  I don't think.  I'm not sure if the Dolphins were home.  I don't know if they were home.  Oh, that's right.  You took it for.  For Big Ken.  Right.  For the future father-in-law.  Yeah.  He wasn't happy with me when we were hanging out yesterday.  I wouldn't be either.  Jesus.  Wow, this guy made a lot of money.  Which one?  Max from Dallas.  What's up, Max?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Ope.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  Gigi Rock. 
[00:13:30]  Got me four grand on that past Dallas game.  Max won $4,000.  I'm so glad, like, the sports curse is at least turning in my favor.  Like, I'm feeling good.  I made a lot of people a lot of money over the weekend.  Usually Monday is a lot of phone calls going, F you, stop rooting for my team, go F yourself,  go to hell, go this, go that.  But now people are winning money.  Everyone's happy.  Yep.  Let's say hi to Dan in Pennsylvania.  Dan, what's up? 
[00:14:00]  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey.  Opey's like a retarded Biff from Back to the Future with a sports almanac.  I hope he got the wrong sports almanac.  Oh, that's good.  Let's go to Tim in Wisconsin.  Tim, what's up?  Yeah, Ope.  I just wanted to tell you, your sports curse doesn't only affect the outcome of the game.  You actually poison everything sports-related when you open your app.  I work nights.  I'm a local truck driver.  I've got 16 hours into the day trying to avoid the score of the Packers game so I can go home 
[00:14:30]  and watch it on TiVo, and here, with an hour left to go, your mongoloid ass comes on the  radio and tells me who won.  Oh, really?  Yeah, thanks, bro.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you figured it's safe to listen to Opey and Anthony, and they're not going to talk  about the Packers.  Yeah.  You really had no idea the Packers won until we told you five minutes ago.  I snapped at people, they were talking about the score, and I fill up gas stations, they're  talking about the score.  Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  I'm ignoring TVs. 
[00:15:00]  I listened to your replays for 16 straight hours because I knew nothing sports-related  could come on on 202.  All of a sudden, you guys come up live, and in the first five minutes, they're better than  the Packers, they won.  So thanks, dude.  All right, man.  Sorry about that.  No problem, bro.  All right.  Let's go to Sean in Cincinnati.  Sean, what's up?  Ope, Ope, the Bengals need to win bad.  How much do you love the Jets at Cincinnati, please?  I got to wait. 
[00:15:30]  I got to let it stick in for a few days.  It's a little early.  Because now this guy's chomping at the bit, though.  Look at him.  Oh, please, you love the Jets, don't you?  Oh, God, my God.  Now I'm just feeling the pressure to pick the right team.  Because he can, like, he throws a curveball in there, because I was sure he was going to  go with the Pats.  I was sure you were going with the Pats over the weekend.  And then you said Dallas.  Were you kind of amazed over the weekend just watching these teams?  I was stunned.  And it really has gotten my interest up in watching some of these games. 
[00:16:00]  Because I was watching the Dallas Pats game.  Yeah, because you were sending out an email immediately.  I'm like, wow, Ant's watching football today.  That's a little different for him.  Oh, my God.  Because, you know, the Pats were winning.  And then Dallas, wow, what a nice little comeback.  They pull ahead.  And then it's, I just knew.  I knew that they couldn't just hold it.  And they were going to lose.  Well, I was two for nine. 
[00:16:30]  Two for nine.  Over the weekend.  And that's with a Kansas City Chiefs pick.  I don't even know who's on the team, to be honest with you.  I just circled that on my sheet.  And I went Packers.  Packers was probably the only game I cared enough about to know the outcome.  So there you go.  As far as football picks go, wow, I was two for seven in that.  And then I went with the Sox, and I went with the Islanders for a two for nine weekend.  Travis still in the lead as far as the football picks go. 
[00:17:00]  But Steve was the weekly winner.  This is all courtesy of what?  Dish Network?  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  It was a lot of fun hanging out with a bunch of bitter Yankee fans watching that Sox game, though.  Because it was just having a few beers and just applauding.  What happened in the 11th inning?  I hadn't watched it.  Oh, my God.  The Sox, you know, obviously extra innings.  So they were tied 6-6 going into the 11th inning. 
[00:17:30]  Had they blown a lead going in, or had they caught up in going to the end?  Earlier in the game?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not sure how that went.  I was in transit.  I think the Indians came back, yeah.  Yeah, because the Red Sox were winning that game for the most part.  And then the Indians came back, tied it up.  And then, you know, stupid me, I went to bed at 1 in the morning thinking this thing.  I started thinking that I could go to bed at 1, get up at 7, 38, because I'd wake up early on weekends 
[00:18:00]  because of this stupid morning radio we do.  Yeah.  And I was convinced that the game was going to still be on.  I was convinced of it.  But it lasted another inning and another hour.  That's why baseball is just killing itself.  It really is.  Yeah, with the late games.  Obviously, a lot of people in Cleveland and a lot of people in Boston are going to watch  a 5, 5 1⁄2 hour baseball game.  But how do you get the rest of the country involved in that?  You get 5 1⁄2 hours to watch it. 
[00:18:30]  You get bitter Yankee fans.  Maybe it wasn't 5 1⁄2 hours, but I think it was pushing 5 hours for a baseball game?  Holy crap.  Yeah.  Yeah, apparently, I guess they had to say the Indians caught up and passed them in the  11th.  So, they had it locked up.  Oh, that sports curse is great.  Let's say hi to Bill on Long Island.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Opie, I want to buy a new Jeep.  Who's winning the Giant Falcon game tonight?  Give it to me, baby. 
[00:19:00]  Maybe I should pick that one.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  You're a god, by the way.  Oh, thank you, Mr. John.  Maybe a little later on.  Who's winning the game tonight?  I've got to wake up still.  It's still early.  All right.  I'll hang on and listen to you.  All right.  Thank you.  Let it sit and fester for a while.  Let's go to Brett in Rochester.  Brett, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Bopey?  I just wanted to say, you know, just stay away from Buffalo.  You screwed me last year, guys.  I mean.  Yeah, I was going for the Sabres all the way last year. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  It didn't work out too well for the Buffalo Sabres after the Islanders were knocked out.  So, no, this sports curse goes back to our NEW days.  This goes way back.  We just kind of mentioned it every once in a while, but lately we've been talking about  it, and it's just been working like a charm.  The Phillies was just amazing.  Three and out after I threw my support behind them.  All right, Brett.  Are you listening on the edge?  I hope so.  No, I'm listening on CKG online. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, CKG online.  Well, that feed's going away soon.  All right.  Thank you, Brett.  I'm going to join it while it lasts.  All right, cool.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We've got lots to do today.  877-212-O&A.  Are we giving away another $1,000 today yet?  Of course we are.  We give it away every day.  What's the sound that these dopes have to listen for today?  Well, if I recall, let me pop this up here.  This is the sound.  Not now.  Don't call now.  The sound is between 7 and 7.30. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  If you hear this.  Oosh.  That's the sound.  Between 7 and 7.30, you give us a call at 877-212-O&A.  If you're the 10th caller, you'll win $1,000.  Yes.  All right.  Speaking of which, RPI, faithful listener of the show.  Remember we gave the listeners a homework assignment?  They're still working on them?  Yeah.  To come up with some kind of production for this contest?  Or a sweeper? 
[00:21:00]  Right.  This is RPI's attempt.  Hi, who's this?  We have come up with the simplest contest you can do.  It's so easy.  Oh, it needs a fancy name.  It's the Opie Anthony Prize Pig Extravaganza.  Hi, who's this?  Here's the deal.  O&A tell you the sound that they're going to play between 7 and 7.30 a.m. Eastern Time.  You'd be the 10th caller at 1-877-212-O-AND.  That's 1-877-212-O-AND. 
[00:21:30]  You better try it right now to make sure it works.  I just wanted to kick out the right phone number.  And you guys thought we were joking about people being stupid.  I just put a big loser on my head.  I just called the number to make sure that it was the right number for the contest.  I hate you.  If you're the 10th prize pick to call in, you win.  A grand-a-roonie.  The cool grand.  A thousand-buck-a-roon.  So then, you'll not only be a prize pick, you'll also be a goddamn-a-roonie. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  There you go.  Very good job by RPI.  And by the way, can I get a witness?  Can I get a witness?  You testifying?  I'm testifying.  Can I get a witness?  What's up?  Look at the phones.  You told them not to call.  Not to call.  I said, do not call.  It was a direct order.  I'll never understand it. 
[00:22:30]  We just got to do poopy jokes for four straight hours.  Never understand it.  That'll get the job done.  Why are they calling right now?  What possible reason do they have to call?  Stupid.  Every line is ringing right now.  And they don't want to talk about the sports curse that much.  All right.  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  We'll continue in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony with little Jimmy Norton. 
[00:23:00]  A lot of people calling about Jimmy and HBO.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Guy in Brooklyn.  Guy, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hi, Guy.  First thing, I just want to let you know that my wife was in labor for less time than a commercial break.  Oh, jeez.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Yeah, Opie, stay away from the Giants.  Just don't even take the game.  And Norton?  Yes.  That show was incredible. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, thank you very much.  I don't know what was better.  The brutal honesty, the quality of humor, or the reactions on the face of my wife and her girlfriend?  Oh, it was classic.  Were they not happy?  I don't know.  They were happy, but, you know, they were in awe.  Oh, thank you, sir.  It was good stuff.  You're awesome, Jimmy.  Just so honest and to the point and not afraid to say whatever you got to say, man.  You're the man.  Thanks, man.  Thanks to all the people that supported it and the nice MySpace messages. 
[00:24:00]  You know, it was very nice, man.  I read them, and it meant a lot.  Thank you.  All right, frunkers.  All right, Guy.  Yeah, talking about Jim Norton's HBO special.  I watched it down there in Philly with the Philly crew, and then we all called you, Jimmy.  Yeah, it was like it.  Y'all were screaming into the phone for you.  Yeah, it was very happy.  We were very excited, and everyone was just, they loved the whole hour.  The whole hour was amazing.  Let's go to Ray in Rhode Island.  Ray, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Jimmy, love Monster Rain.  Fantastic.  Thank you very much.  Nice to hear something so different for a change. 
[00:24:30]  Thanks, man.  Somebody actually speaking their mind.  Did you notice, like, a dope, when I said, thank you.  I love that.  Nothing beats you trying to describe to that lady in the first row exactly what Monster Rain was.  Yeah.  Yeah, they, uh, I tried to find a girl.  I wish they would have got a better shot of her, because there was another girl during the first show who I think I had described.  Whatever show it was, but she wasn't the Asian girl they showed.  Yeah.  They might have flipped from a different show.  I don't know.  They just showed a different girl. 
[00:25:00]  Why was she left crying?  That's all that matters, right?  Of course, sir.  Thank you.  I was trying to point that out to people.  Just, I mean, I caught myself dragging that out.  Mick Jagger.  The nerve in me.  The nerve.  Like, I'm a British rock star.  Like, it was Giant Stadium.  Thank you.  It's there forever.  Yeah, right.  Hopey, go Sox.  Go Sox is right.  Yeah.  Do not bet against the Pats again, please.  Call your brother.  No, I mean, if you're a Pats fan, you did well. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, very well.  Ray's getting confused.  Have a good one.  Punch it out.  Of course he is.  He doesn't know how it works.  By the way, Jim Norton's HBO special is going to be on DVD starting tomorrow, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's on sale tomorrow.  Extra material and stuff.  Just in case you missed it Saturday night.  Let's go to Justin in Dallas.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wanted to call and say, Jim, I'm a trucker, and I took the day off just to  get a hotel room so I could get on HBO and watch your special.  I thought it was great, and I thought it was really classy how you got O&A to stand up 
[00:26:00]  and acknowledge it, man.  That was very, very cool.  Thank you, man.  They actually didn't show up.  I had to superimpose them.  We had two actors, and I just put open hands in.  Yeah, of course, man.  I'm very happy.  I love when they come to my shows.  It's not to be polite.  Go ahead, you talk.  Sorry, sorry, Jim.  No, it's all right.  My explanation was getting boring and long-winded, and you stepped in and you said...  Hey, Opie, I hope you get colon cancer.  Stay away from the Cowboys.  See you, boys.  All right, take care.  Why?  I pushed my business.  What else?  Ford's curse is making people want you to get colon cancer. 
[00:26:30]  What else do you want from me?  I picked the Cowboys at home.  That was a good freaking pick.  It's also not his fault.  I don't know what it is.  It's not his fault that he does it.  He picks teams that he wants to win.  It's just a poor guy wanting his team to win.  Let's go to Rob.  And they lose.  Rob in New Hampshire.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Congratulations, Jimmy, on Monster Rain.  It was excellent.  Thank you, man, very much.  That K said space food gag.  I didn't hear a thing you said five minutes after. 
[00:27:00]  I was laughing so hard.  Thank you.  And you can thank Anthony for the space food reference.  No.  Oh, Jimmy knows how to take it and run with it.  Oh, you bet I did.  Anthony dropped a bag of money out the window, and I picked it up and invested it properly.  And that insult thing you were doing is excellent, too.  If you remember when that commercial first came out, and then the first guy would be like,  you know, are you gelling?  And the second guy was a black guy saying, well, I got a felon.  Yep.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  That lasted about a week and a half before they changed that.  They pulled that ad.  Exactly.  All right, Rob.  It was seen as not an ad, but a public service ad.  Yeah.  Well, take care, guys.  I listen to you every day.  I've been listening to you since AF.  Thank you, Rob.  We appreciate that.  Yeah, everyone very, very happy for Jimmy today.  You know what?  I remember us talking after the special was filmed, because it was filmed, what, three  months ago now?  Yeah, in early June.  And the only thing that we were kind of nervous about was some of the material, if it would  still hold up.  And I'm watching on Saturday night, like, wow, I'm still in the news. 
[00:28:00]  And Nicole Smith, that case is reopened.  The book coming out.  Yeah, the book coming out.  Controversy with that.  And they what?  They just arrested her old doctor or something, or they're looking into what she was doing  for Nicole Smith in the last days of her life.  Yeah.  And all the material was still very current.  Yeah, I tried to.  It's weird with topical stuff, because you're kind of giving away when it was shot.  But Imus, of course, is good.  Even if Imus had been rehired and back on the radio.  Imus is coming back.  He's going to make an announcement that he's signed a five-year deal any day now. 
[00:28:30]  That would be nice.  What?  What did I just say?  Wow.  Rumors in the paper that there were people going to ABC.  I mean, whether it's true or not, who knows?  But that stuff's going to be, it's major stories.  Right.  Britney's going to be famous for a long time.  Yeah.  Yeah, that wasn't going away.  It wasn't like, what about the Britney guy?  Yeah, but.  Can I leave her alone?  Like, that's the guy who comes and goes.  Yeah, but Britney is still just so hot still.  Yeah.  I mean, as far as, you know, the media goes, you know.  Is that the new picture?  Yeah.  That's the new one?  That's the new one? 
[00:29:00]  A new oopsie?  Oh, no.  Can you zoom in on that?  And let's see the oopsie?  All right.  There we go.  Well, that still looks a little Barbie doll-ish.  It doesn't look.  I don't know.  It always looks like part of it's being hidden.  Yeah.  On the leg.  It's like, can you make up your mind?  Well, she's got that thigh fat that kind of gets in the way of the oopsie.  And what's this?  That is kind of a nice one.  What's that stuff?  That's like five o'clock shadow stuff.  Get in there.  See when you get.  Okay, that's more of a.  That's kind of nice. 
[00:29:30]  What is she doing, man?  What is she doing?  She just loves showing that.  But she won't show it.  She's trying to get her kids back.  She's always naked.  What is she trying?  Her defense is, look, they came out of here.  What is she?  I should have them.  Exactly.  Stop showing the kids' first house off.  But who knew that Britney would still be.  I mean, she's even hotter since you filmed the HBO special, you know?  In the news.  These bimbos come and go.  Remember, it was all about Paris for like three or four months. 
[00:30:00]  And, you know, she's still out and about.  But Britney never went away since the taping of the HBO special.  That's great.  You got Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan.  And they're pulling the oopsie.  And, I mean, you could see it.  It's clear as day when they do that move to get out of the vehicle.  With Britney, she's got that thigh fat going.  So it's kind of hidden.  She gets hidden by the thigh fat.  She's really got to like, you know, her knees have to be, oof. 
[00:30:30]  She has to do a V and then a headstand if she wants everybody to see it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  How many oopsies does she have now?  There's a whole, like, montage of Britney oopsies on the way.  There's another one.  Wow, that's a long one.  Oh.  Zoom in.  Zoom in.  That must have...  What?  Wow, what the F is that?  What's going on there?  It's just thighs.  Look at her breast hanging on either side without them being held up.  Wow.  That's like a fake oopsie. 
[00:31:00]  They look like basset hound ears.  Just kind of flopping left and right.  Let's go to Coke Logic.  Oh, she's turning into a fat mess.  I love her.  Yeah.  Just a slob.  Coke Logic, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Congratulations, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  Very much.  How's Chicago, buddy?  Hey, I just wanted to point out how great it was that when you said my fat friend bugged  me about poker, everyone knew it was Bob Kelly.  Oh, yeah, and it was, too.  That is the idiot who plays poker, is stupid Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  Congratulations, Bobby, on getting married.  Yes. 
[00:31:30]  We're all very happy for him and his fiancée, now his wife, Dawn.  And I missed the wedding that was online because I couldn't get online.  I couldn't get to the site.  He goes to Hawaii, has his wedding, lets all his friends watch it online, and I couldn't  get it, but I hear I can watch a replay of it.  Oh, good.  Up on the site.  I want to see if I couldn't hear it.  Are you kidding?  Oh, I absolutely want to pull some of that video and just do some Photoshop magic to it.  You got to see him there standing, because he's wearing like a white shirt. 
[00:32:00]  You know, Dawn looks really good.  She's wearing like, you know, a wedding gown.  She looks really very pretty, but Bob just standing there in his stupid white shirt.  Look, he's like some kind of an extravagant Coke dealer on the beach examining what it  is.  He's like a stupid bald head.  He's awful.  He's like the mayor of a small island.  I want to bullwhip his legs.  I want to bullwhip Bob Kelly's legs.  Let's go to Matt in Allentown.  Living here in Allentown. 
[00:32:30]  Well, is it that Allentown, though?  I don't know.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  I love you.  You're great.  The only problem is, you got to stop doing the girls shaving their stuff area jokes, because  you cost me a 45-minute argument about why I wanted to shave it.  Oh, well, dude, I talk about, you say, certain body parts being easier to see when certain  things are removed, because I like it.  But you got to be firm, sir. 
[00:33:00]  You can't ask, hey, could you take care of that?  Here's some cream and a razor.  You got to just say it.  Do it.  Or you're standing outside in the cold.  Unless you're hoping for a date with Brother Elmo, and then you just leave it alone.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's awful.  He just likes it.  Just keep watering it, man.  That's what he wants.  That's a mess.  Sorry, buddy.  All right, Matt.  Thanks, guys.  Love it.  Oh, error.  We had your thank you.  But we have a little error on the disc here.  Thank God the disc was throwing up.  Maybe take two.  Thank you.  I love that. 
[00:33:30]  I want to hear it 80 times.  That's never good when a member of the staff is just crossing their fingers, hoping it works.  All right, we're out.  That's not going to work.  Damn it.  Let's go to Chris in New Hyde Park.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Love the show.  Doesn't like Britney Spears and all these girls in the news remind you of the girls you went  to high school with that were cheerleaders that just got strung out on drugs just because  they were cute and they were cheerleaders?  Like, is this really news at this point?  I mean, I know it's funny and everything, but I mean, if you live in Long Island, this 
[00:34:00]  is going on, like, down the block.  Chris, I wouldn't know.  I couldn't get close to the cheerleaders.  I wasn't allowed in that group of people in high school.  I stalked a cheerleader.  You stalked a cheerleader?  Oh, I was a stalker for this cheerleader at John H. Glenn High School there in Elwood.  She had red hair, like strawberry blondish hair, and just looked great in her little cheerleader  outfit and didn't, you know, didn't know I was even in the same friggin' school. 
[00:34:30]  It was one of those deals.  But I would watch her practice.  I'd watch her do cheerleader practice.  And I was like, ooh.  Then I saw her years later.  Ah, it is balloon.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Had about three kids, I guess.  And really plumped up.  Good.  Really plumped up. 
[00:35:00]  Well, you see, what I did, guys, is I got her in between that point.  I got her in between the point of having me, you know, graduating from high school and  then having that kid.  I had that, like, when she was fucked up but still looked good, like, six months before  Britney collapsed.  Right.  Like, I had her just in that point.  But, I mean, you know, that's when you gotta grab him.  But I, she fucked me up.  She got me in fucking jail.  Please.  How about we stop cursing a little bit so, you know, twice as many people can listen 
[00:35:30]  to your story?  Yes.  I apologize.  We would like the regular radio listeners, not just the XM listeners, to hear you, sir.  You lose half your audience if you start cursing, that's all.  It's up to you.  If you want to curse, who are we to say?  But, you know, if you want more people listening, then you gotta clean up a little bit.  To hear your point.  She got you in jail?  Well, what happened was, she was, uh, she was all messed up on, uh, you know, she was  doing drugs, and that's how me and her...  The uppers or the downers? 
[00:36:00]  The downers.  Was she doing the yellow jackets?  Right.  Smoking the reefers?  No, really.  A lot harder than that, guys.  A lot harder than that.  Huffing, huffing glue?  Yeah.  Was she doing horse?  Yeah.  Was she smoking Mary Jane?  Mary Jane.  It's a horse, fella.  Was it some of that Mary Jane?  Mary Jane.  Was she on coke?  Old man ways and saying drugs, my father used to say, you're not on coke, are you?  On coke.  No.  Awful term screw-upper.  But, uh, yeah, no, she, uh, she got me all hooked up on that H. And then I got arrested 
[00:36:30]  copping, uh, you know, copping for us, but, uh, anyway.  He just gave the, anyway, could you please hang up on me?  All right, we'll do that.  Let's say hi to Nick in Philly.  Nick, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  I just want to tell Jimmy, I watched that episode, uh, the show on Saturday.  HBO.  When you said the, uh, the woman makes your face a bumpy thing, the eye almost fell off  the couch laughing at that. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, how they use us.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  They certainly do.  A bumpy thing.  She was looking at me like she knew I wasn't laughing anymore, but just because I thought  it was funny because I knew it was true.  Oh, of course it is.  She just stopped laughing and looking at me like, oh, no.  And I was like, oh, man, that's funny, man.  That's so funny.  Thank you, bud.  You're the animals.  That is funny because you would, you wouldn't bash your face against anything else in this  planet like that.  No.  Like you do.  Imagine just walking up to a wall and doing that with your chin and your cheekbones and 
[00:37:30]  your nose.  Nose.  Whatever else you're using.  And your brow.  Whatever it takes.  Your forehead.  It looks like someone took just a filthy paint roller and rubbed it over your face.  A slimy, filthy paint roller.  You know, if you don't mind, I dip this in cod oil.  I'm going to paint your face.  All over your cheekbones.  Your chinny chin chin.  You never think of doing that.  Your earlobes.  That's what the rookies don't understand. 
[00:38:00]  Have you named every part of the face?  Do you get the bit, do you?  It is really funny, though.  You're right.  There's nothing else you would rub that face against.  Like that.  Against.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  London.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Altamont Speedway.  Get off of my cloud.  Thank you.  We're going to do paint it black.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:38:30]  Thank you.  I'm a deuce.  Ladies and gentlemen, Keith Richards.  I'm a deuce.  I'm a deuce.  I'm a deuce.  Hello, Emily.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What a fool.  All right.  I think we have tomorrow's sound.  Thank you.  People are calling.  They think it's the sound.  Speaking of the sound. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, we do have to acknowledge a couple of things.  First of all, Cody in Indiana, faithful listener of the show.  They're replaying Bob's Wedding on Animal Planet at three, six, and nine today.  That's good.  That's funny.  Watch the talking otter, led to beautiful American girl.  And we got to acknowledge Jill TV.  Wow.  Jill Nicolini.  Wow.  I think she lost a bet yesterday because she's showing a lot today. 
[00:39:30]  She's got her big breast dress on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the big booby dress.  What she wants to show a lot.  So let's say hi to Randy.  She's a girl in South Hold.  What's up, Randy?  Listen, I'm trying to get this sound bite, and it's not going on.  I think you're playing tricks on me, and I hear for tomorrow it's going to be,  thank you, thank you.  But I don't care about tomorrow.  I care about today.  All right, but don't make it sound like that thank you clip is done by a fool. 
[00:40:00]  Well, there's a lot of fools out there, especially my husband.  He's the biggest fool because...  Thank you.  You're talking like Sonny Wartick's wife in Dog Day Afternoon.  I said, is he going to shoot me with the sound clip and dump my body in the river?  He says, get on the ride, you fat pig.  No, I want to tell you what my husband did to me.  You know when you have that wake up your wife kind of thing?  Yeah.  He did it to me with a leaf blower right in my bedroom.  Know what the beauty is?  He didn't even call our show.  That's just how he feels about you.  And he made a mistake.  He thought it was a shotgun. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, usually when they wake up their spouses on our show,  they're both fans of the show, and it's annoying, but then later in the day,  everyone's happy.  But with you, he's just so annoyed.  That's how he wants to wake you up every day with no one listening.  Maybe you had leaves on your face.  No, because he just wants you know what.  He thinks he's going to get it after that.  Oh, he wants you know what.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You know what that is.  Because when a guy wants to get a little action from his girl,  that's the first thing they're thinking.  Go get the leaf blower from the shed and then wake her up. 
[00:41:00]  Well, I'm on strike.  I told him.  That's it.  Arya.  Arya on strike.  Arya life.  Is he in the doghouse?  Is he?  Well, we have five kids, so, you know, we have done it a few times, right?  Five kids?  How old?  What's the age range?  17, 15, 9, and twin six-year-olds.  Oh, all right.  God almighty.  Every time you renovate the room, you wreck it again.  Well, yeah, we're always in the process. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, so you want to win $1,000 today?  I think I need a couple of that.  A couple of $1,000.  All right, and you're looking for what today?  Just a soundbite.  It's close to seven already, and I don't even know what it is.  Oh, you need to know what the soundbite is?  Yeah, that would be nice.  All righty.  Well.  I don't know, man.  It's 25 minutes up.  It's not even.  What are we supposed to do?  Do individual phone calls play them the soundbite?  Right.  You'll know when the soundbite's coming.  Let's say hi to. 
[00:42:00]  I say we don't play it again until it's got to be played.  Yeah.  Great.  Maybe we'll give it out to a faithful listener today.  Yeah.  These big concert pigs.  Prize pigs.  Prize pigs.  Leo, Long Island, what's up?  How's it going, man?  Hi, Leo.  I just want to tell Jimmy you had a great show the other night.  Thank you, buddy.  I laughed my ass off.  I didn't laugh harder than that in I don't know how long.  Thank you, Leo.  The ratings must make it huge, Jimmy.  I hope so.  I don't know.  It's like a lot of people checked it out.  A lot of people, and it's going to be available tomorrow on DVD for the people that missed out 
[00:42:30]  on it.  Apparently ratings don't mean anything for HBO, though.  They do have a way of tracking it.  No, I mean, it doesn't mean anything, because, you know, a show could have ratings and still  be, you know, taken off.  It certainly can.  Bastards.  Or it doesn't have to, and it can stay on second year.  Fly to the Concords.  It doesn't have a lot of viewers, but it's great to like it.  Go ahead, man.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Jimmy, you coming to Long Island at all?  Eventually, sir.  Not for a while.  Oh, good.  I'm working on a new hour.  Thank you, buddy.  I'll be in Danbury, Connecticut this weekend at the Treehouse trying to work on my new 
[00:43:00]  hour.  Danbury.  Danbury.  Danbury.  And then I'm doing Queensbury.  Queensbury.  Queensbury.  In two weeks.  Yeah, Matt's from Queensbury.  All right, yeah, we gotta take a break.  I was excited.  I thought you were handing me something fun.  Just the break sign.  Yeah.  Just the lousy break sign.  Oh, tape.  He's handing his roll of scotch tape.  Oh, I love playing with tape during the show.  I like taping my pointer and middle finger together sometimes.  I don't know why I do that.  Yeah?  Like, it's one big finger I could just poke in the eye of someone. 
[00:43:30]  That's silly.  That is silly.  I do.  I'll tape my pointer finger and I don't know why.  And then I'll just try to separate my fingers.  Yeah.  And then like Britney's fat legs, it just won't come apart.  So you can't see the little crook of skin in between my fingers.  The little oopsie.  Your finger oopsie.  Hey, uh, uh, you know, every once in a while you just gotta do it.  So, uh, I hope they're paying attention down the hall.  I am just gonna read this.  Alrighty. 
[00:44:00]  Uh, Gut Shot Drew from Howl writes, you know, the leaf blower girl with the five kids.  He uses the leaf blower to move her bunt to take a look.  It's fun.  Sure.  Absolutely.  Maybe it made the radio, maybe not.  What did that sound like?  Just flapping.  Like a basset hound sticking his head out the window while you're driving down the highway. 
[00:44:30]  Like blowing up a toupee.  It looks like that old footage, that slow motion footage of someone going too fast in a wind tunnel.  Yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  Jimmy, they're still calling about the HBO special.  I just want to acknowledge that.  We could take calls all morning long for Jimmy.  He, uh, absolutely killed on HBO Saturday night.  We're all very excited.  Yes. 
[00:45:00]  And so was Jimmy, because he thanked everybody.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Hey, hey!  Oof.  Hey!  Oh!  Oh!  Let's go!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Stop me up!  After I said that, somebody should have come over with a baseball bat with a shepherd's pie on  the end of it and smashed it into my face.  Thank you!  Thank you!  You should get scurvy.  I really should.  Oh, what an F.  All right.  We'll, uh, yes. 
[00:45:30]  We're going to give away $1,000 after the break.  I know that much.  Yeah.  And we're going to talk about some other things.  We're going to talk about something that, uh, prevented me from sleeping last night.  Oh, okay.  It can't be homeless people, um, defecating outside your window, because you don't live  there anymore.  It can't be rats.  Better not be rats.  Oh.  It can't be roaches.  No.  It can't be...  No, I'll tell you what was happening in the apartment on Friday, though.  Yeah.  Um.  Hardcore, uh...  And I think it might have something to do with, uh... 
[00:46:00]  I haven't even...  Have I mentioned that I live either below or above, uh, Kathleen Turner?  Really?  After all the history you've had with her over the years?  Do you hear anything?  I actually live either above her or below her.  Do you hear any sexy moaning?  No.  Ugh.  No.  Ugh.  Ugh.  With her man voice now?  And the only...  She's cultivated.  The only reason I bring that up today is just keep that in mind when I tell you what  happened in my apartment yesterday, okay? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  A little radio tease for everybody, but we don't need the radio tease today because we got  a thousand dollars we're giving away next.  You hear this?  From, uh, her apartment?  Ugh!  Ugh!  And that's her.  Yeah, that's her.  I'm trying to put her shoes on.  That's her.  Here she is.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's the noise she...  Yeah, exactly.  We all got one.  I want to get mine in.  That's the noise she made when someone suggested maybe she eat a carrot. 
[00:47:00]  Really?  Oof.  Wait, that was the noise.  When he heard that noise, her husband ran in and said, honey, the plunger.  Well, funny you should say that.  Oh, yeah?  That has something to do with my little story that I'll tell next.  Oh.  Well, uh...  Oh, oh, did you hear more sounds from her?  We'll get into it next.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:47:30]  Ah!  That's I do in sea cow talk.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife.  Ah!  Ah!  I guess that's I do.  Ah!  I don't know.  I don't have the English to fat ass translation book.  They said you may kiss the bride and when it was her turn they said you may feed the groom  a fish.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:48:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Thomas and Paul's stupid Bob.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh we got to get him something too.  Yeah!  I know.  Oh.  Ah!  That's why he did that Now we all have to get him something so we're invited to his...  Yeah.  Ah!  It's like going to the wedding without actually going, but he makes out because you got to get him 
[00:48:30]  a gift.  Ah!  Ah!  We usually have to pay for the wedding by going there.  Pay for the food that you're eating.  What do you get when you're watching online?  Get them something virtual then.  How about some recordable DVDs?  We'll get them that.  There you go.  There you go, stupid.  Take Barney Miller to hang yourself.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ah, the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:49:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie.  Anthony.  Jim Norton.  HBO Star.  Yes.  His special will be on DVD tomorrow.  Let's go to Jennifer.  Jennifer, what's up?  I'm Arch, what's up?  Hey, Jennifer, how are you?  Yuck.  Anthony.  Yuck.  Absolutely fabulous, isn't you?  I feel it.  I'm real good, but Anthony hates your name.  Yuck. 
[00:49:30]  I know he does.  Your name sucks.  And I'm one of the good Jennifer's that hate phone call Thursday.  Yeah.  Ew.  Yeah.  So why are you calling, Jennifer?  I thought I heard the sound during the commercial.  Jennifer thought she heard the sound during the commercial.  Oh, cool.  What sound is that, Jennifer?  What?  The sound of what?  Uh-huh.  She heard this. 
[00:50:00]  You heard.  What?  What sound?  Oh, my God.  Look who the caller is right under her.  Yeah, I know.  Jesus.  It's tripped down memory lane.  What is it?  X day?  Thank you, Jennifer.  You did not win.  We haven't played the sound yet.  We're going to play at any moment.  Or we're going to milk it all the way to 730.  I don't know.  We haven't decided yet. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Love you guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Ant, you love her?  No.  No.  No.  Jennifer, I don't love you.  I never really did.  All right.  It's chill, man.  She's just a caller.  I'm talking to a caller.  Oh, okay.  I was doing this.  Let's go to Dominic.  Dominic?  Jesus.  Dominic?  Thanks.  What the hell is this?  Jesus Christ.  It has a bit inside, but the names on the phones right now are a little weird. 
[00:51:00]  They're killing me.  There's a couple X's up there.  There's a lawyer that's killing somebody.  Great.  You go from a call from Jennifer to call it Dominic.  Sorry.  What's next?  Bank of America?  How come you don't talk about E-Rock anymore?  What?  There's really not much left to talk about.  He's fat.  He's stupid.  He's stupid. 
[00:51:30]  He's not competent at his job.  He's late all the time.  He has a flesh inner tube around his head and neck.  What do you want us to say about him?  He's a good boy.  Yeah.  What do you need?  It is E-Rock.  Children's closing.  Closing.  Closing.  He can talk.  I can't.  I stink.  Closing.  So on Friday, I had a lot of workers in my place.  Getting some things done with the new pad.  And I get home from work and my fiancée. 
[00:52:00]  Fiancée.  My fiancée.  I hate that.  I don't hate that.  I'm getting married.  Fiancée.  I hate that word.  It just is awful.  Here's my fiancée.  Here's my fiancée.  Fiancée.  Fiancée.  Fiancée.  Fiancée.  Fiancée.  Fiancée.  She's like, you better get in here.  I'm like, what?  And we go into a bathroom, right?  And I know what you're thinking.  You're going to think it's the workers, but they're not in this part of the apartment whatsoever. 
[00:52:30]  It's closed off.  It's the little area we're living in as they do some renovation.  Yeah, you've got to find refuge in your own place while they're ripping everything apart.  Right.  So I'm like, what's the deal?  And she lifts up the lid.  Oh, no.  And it is filled to the brim.  Get out of here.  With other people's lunch.  Other people's you-know-what.  They actually have been using your facilities. 
[00:53:00]  Who?  The workers.  I said it's impossible.  No workers were in there.  I'm telling you.  They had to be, dude.  Dude, they had to be.  No.  What?  Do you know what's happening then?  Have you put some investigative-  Let's just put it this way.  We could break the flushing mechanism in that bathroom and make everyone use the same bathroom  for the next two to three days, and it wouldn't equal what I saw.  No way. 
[00:53:30]  That's what I'm saying.  To the brim.  Well, where did it come from?  I believe there's a little backup going on in the building.  Oh, so you think it's coming up through-  Whoa, that's creepy.  And I think it might be Kathleen Turner.  Kathleen Turner?  You think Kathleen Turner is just backing up everybody's toilets?  She's quite a healthy woman, I'm thinking.  Oof.  Oh, is there a Roger Rabbit DVD in the bowl? 
[00:54:00]  No.  Was she in that?  Yes.  Oh, I don't even-  No, no.  She did the voice.  Yeah.  Okay.  Didn't she?  I really don't know, to be honest with you.  But-  It's on the movie years ago.  She said Romancing the Stone.  All right, good.  Yeah, yeah.  Romancing the Stone.  Right up to the brim, though.  Right up to the brim.  And I guess there was a bit of a backup going on.  How did you get rid of it?  I call it downstairs.  I don't know how you deal with that.  With a shovel.  Well, maybe like, yeah, like an ice cream scooper or something. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  A little pail and shovel like kids use at the beach.  Yeah, but right up to the brim.  Had to deal with that on Friday.  And then last night, just before I go to bed there, I start checking out some websites.  And a lot of people are like, should we talk about this?  Should we not talk about this?  I don't know.  I think we should at least address this a little bit.  Address?  There's a bit of a rumor out there, courtesy of the New York Radio Message Board, which 
[00:55:00]  has been pretty accurate over the years as far as what's going on with us.  Some stuff.  He does pretty well, that Alan Sniffin.  Unless he was predicting the comeback being faster than it was.  Follow the money!  Yeah, yeah.  Follow the money!  We get it, stupid.  The money is followed.  We're sitting to 26 months.  Follow the money!  He knows how to sniff out a good rumor.  There's been rumors, though, that we were going to be gone from regular radio when we  were on NEW for six months. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  It's like, oh, I hear after we were there six months.  Well, I know they're not going to be there much longer.  And then we end up blasting another two, oh, two, five years ago.  Yeah.  Something like that.  But this is being reported on the New York Radio Message Board, and I just want to know  what the F is going on.  Either way, it's posted by Alan Sniffin, so it's not even one of these douches that is  just bitter.  And there's a lot of guys that are just bitter that go on the New York Radio Message Board  and just start all sorts of crap because they have no business being in radio anymore. 
[00:56:00]  So they want to ruin it for everybody.  Or they're not in radio, or they were years ago, and yeah.  Or they never got out of college radio, and they're just bitter that their talent was  never discovered.  They don't like anybody who has any bit of success in radio.  So Alan posts this right around the time I'm watching the Cowboys loss.  It says, I'm hearing O&A may be out at WYSP in Philly.  Really?  A lot of people in Philly looking at their radios right now. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, this is what's being reported on a message board up here that's pretty popular with people  in the business.  I'm hearing O&A may be out at YSP in Philly soon.  That's significant in that Philadelphia is almost as close to their home station as K-Rock  in New York.  Instance-wise?  And then he continues to write, it's not looking good for O&A on CBS radio these days,  and I don't say that with any happiness.  I really wanted them to get the AM drive slot on Free FM two years ago and predicted big success.  And you all know how much I love to be wrong. 
[00:57:00]  But he is hearing things.  He is hearing that we might be out in Philly, that YSP might be dumping the show.  And then I'm hearing that Kid Chris is making some hints that he might be going to mornings.  Oh, yeah?  He's starting to take little shots at some of the morning shows down there in Philly.  I know this much.  They got a new PD just before they went back to Rock.  They dumped the Free FM format that kept us and they kept Kid Chris.  And they went back to a rock station, something they should have done a long time ago because Philly loves YSP and loves their rock. 
[00:57:30]  And we met the new PD, John Cook, here in New York.  He actually drove up with the GM, sat us down.  This is what's happening.  We want you to be a part of it.  We're very excited.  Yeah.  And that was a day or two before he went down there to broadcast live for the virus show and stuff.  And he said he was going to bother the hell out of us with emails.  And, you know, he really, really likes the show, big fans, blah, blah, blah, and just wants to send a lot of emails.  So we're well informed as far as the Philly market goes. 
[00:58:00]  Yep.  And we like when PDs do that.  So we feel like we're part of the city that we're broadcasting in.  That was right around September 1st, somewhere around there.  And we haven't heard from the guy since.  So that's why I'm like a little suspicious.  I mean, this is a rumor, but I want to get to the bottom of it.  Maybe he's busy.  Busy doing what?  I don't know.  Maybe he's busy.  The point was raised that they flipped formats.  So maybe just trying to get things together with the format flip and get the right music. 
[00:58:30]  Busy doing what?  It's a jukebox.  I was down there this weekend.  Well, you'd hope it.  The jocks aren't allowed to talk that much.  They got the Eagles football.  I heard a few promos for our show.  Different music than is playing on other stations, you hope.  So maybe they do research.  What kind of research do they do?  Who do they talk to?  Have you ever been asked a question about music on the radio?  Never.  Research is like, do you like hearing the Red Hot Chili Peppers after Pearl Jam or after Metallica?  Do you like hearing Muse on your radio or do you like just hearing that on your iPod? 
[00:59:00]  Does it seem like people who program stations, and this is all radio stations,  they don't let people just kind of go with their intuition.  It just seems like they're obsessed with research and obsessed with it, and it seems to fail a lot.  Instead of just kind of going with your gut as a good programmer.  That's what they used to do.  Right?  They would, right?  Yeah.  Stuff that they liked.  They'd have a little bit of freedom to play.  Yeah.  Not a playlist.  You'll turn on any station in the city.  It's the same crap.  I know.  Yeah.  So, I just wanted to address that there is a rumor out there that we might be dumped  from YSP in the very near future, and I would like to know what the F's going on. 
[00:59:30]  I hope it's malarkey.  I know the PD's pretty much avoiding us, so I would like to know what that's about.  I like Philly.  Maybe he's busy.  Maybe he's busy, Ant.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe he's busy.  You say he's busy.  I say he's avoiding us for some reason.  Maybe he's been busy.  Because I even talked to corporate about it.  I'm like, why is he avoiding us?  What's going on?  What could it tell us?  I don't like talking to corporate.  Huh?  I don't like talking to corporate.  I just go to a building, and I talk to the building, because that's like corporate to 
[01:00:00]  me.  You get more done that way.  You get just talking to a wall.  Wow.  A big granite wall.  Hello, sir.  They never tell you the truth, either, because that would be stupid, I guess.  I guess.  I don't know.  It's the nature of the beast.  So that's all we know.  They say.  There's a rumor out there, and I don't know how true it is or how false it is.  Maybe it's ridiculous, but that's being reported today.  Follow the money. 
[01:00:30]  To where?  Let's get ahead.  To a nice seat on the bench for over two years?  I predict they'll be back on by October.  Follow the money.  What?  To a molar that needs to be filled?  You're a dentist.  Follow the electrical outlet cord to the end of the drill and do that.  Yeah, it should be pointed out, the guy that did start the, just for the rest of the country,  the guy that did start this rumor, and he says he has a very reliable source.  Excuse me.  I can't get into that right now, but he says he has a very reliable source. 
[01:01:00]  He is a dentist full time.  He's a dentist.  So maybe we should take it with a grain of salt.  I think he waits until people in the radio business come in, get down in the chair,  and then he just gives them nitrous and asks them questions.  And they go, uh-huh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-huh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.  Oh, really?  Speaking of dentists, we got a naughty dentist that we'll be talking about next.  Very naughty.  And a naughty priest. 
[01:01:30]  We got two really good stories after the break.  But first, Andrew on Long Island.  What's up, Andrew?  Andrew.  Hey, gentlemen.  What's going on?  Hey.  I was calling just to piss Opie off.  I know that you haven't played the...  Tony on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, Opie.  I thought I heard it before when Anthony made his oof.  The clock there?  When you guys are talking about the plumbing.  What happened?  Nothing.  Because the clock was broken that Ant and I look at.  I was going to look to see if it was contest time or thereabouts. 
[01:02:00]  And I went to look at the clock that was there seconds ago.  And I looked and it was gone.  Oh, really?  So I thought I was either going crazy or it broke and just fell on the floor and I didn't hear it.  There's a blood test for Alzheimer's?  They are reporting that they can now do a blood test and find out if you're going to get Alzheimer's  within, like, six months to a year.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's happy news.  You bleed and, like, if the person looks at it and goes, there's red pen on me, they know you're a blithering idiot. 
[01:02:30]  Or if they go, when are we doing the test doc after it's done?  How do I suck?  Good one.  At least you know when to get those wills signed and things like that.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Hey, Grandpa, sorry in these forms.  They said the only previous way to test for Alzheimer's was through an autopsy.  They said that on the news.  That's wonderful.  They were testing the coroner.  Like, if you cut the skull open twice, you had it. 
[01:03:00]  Let's go to Tony.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I thought I heard the song earlier.  The word.  Jay, what's up?  Song.  The word.  Chris, Boston, what's up?  Chris.  Yeah, I heard the word.  I heard it.  Mary, Massachusetts, what's up?  Hey, I kind of sworn I heard the sound.  Go away, concert pig.  Go away.  Are you people insane?  Go away, concert pig. 
[01:03:30]  It's a very distinctive sound.  Carmen, Jersey, what's up?  I heard the phrase.  What did you hear?  What phrase?  I heard, oh!  What did you hear, concert pig?  Concert pig?  Why am I saying, er?  You heard, er?  Yes, I did.  It didn't go like this.  Er.  Er.  Er.  Er.  It went, er.  You heard, er.  It's not the sound, dummy!  The sound is not, er, miss. 
[01:04:00]  That'd be stupid.  You're a contest pig.  That's right.  And a concert pig if you're watching music.  Geez, why did I say concert pig?  It wrecked my whole bit.  All right, Carmen, thanks.  You're a dummy.  Let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  Good morning, boys.  I heard the sound of a...  Uh, Jack, Massachusetts.  What's up?  Jack.  Jack, what's up?  Jack.  Yeah, what's up?  Jack?  Oh.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, Jack?  Yes, uh, the word is boost. 
[01:04:30]  You looking for?  Are you, are people crazy?  Am I, could I, could I jump out that window?  The word is boost?  Who told you to call up and say the word is boost?  Yeah, who, who, how did you figure?  What, what did you hear that led you to call to think that we want to hear that the word  is boost?  Go.  Well, I'll tell you, I know everything about all three of you.  Does that help you? 
[01:05:00]  I know more about you than the FBI.  How's that?  Well, that's all fine and well, sir, but I'm talking about this contest.  Yeah, why did you say the word is boost?  Yes, that's, well, I, I listened to the radio and that's what I heard the word is.  I can't do any better than that.  But don't you, do you know what the rules of the contest are?  The rules are between 7 and 7.30.  If you guys say a sound and I know it, I win.  Say a sound.  But we, we, we, we said we're going to play a sound between 7 and 7.30. 
[01:05:30]  And, and, and if it's the sound that we said we were going to play, like on Friday, we played  it and said, this is the sound we're going to play Monday.  And then if we play it, then you call in, but we, we never played it.  I wrote, I know, but I wrote it down Friday, what you were going to say.  So you thought you would just call randomly and hope we had just played it?  But he's, he's waiting to hear boost, boost. 
[01:06:00]  But he knows more about us than the FBI.  That, that raises some interesting questions.  Can you track what websites we all belong to, sir?  Nothing, sir.  All right, thank you, Jack.  Let's go to Bernadette from Wayne.  Bernadette.  Oh, Bernadette.  Hi.  Hey.  Hi.  I heard you go, wuss.  You heard us say, wuss.  Another contest pig on the line.  Oh, no, that's not true.  Are you an Opie and Anthony show fan, madam?  I love you.  I'm, I'm sitting in the car laughing. 
[01:06:30]  You're, you're just, you know.  What?  Name.  Hold on, hold on.  Name one thing the Opie and Anthony show did, not counting today.  There's so many things.  Where do you want me to be?  So many.  All right.  Well, okay.  Any one.  We just want one.  Because I'm so happy I got two, I'm blank with Alzheimer's.  Geez.  Name one thing.  And I've been broadcasting for, I think, 13 years. 
[01:07:00]  Name one lousy thing we've done on the radio.  You contest pig.  Two people screwed at St. Patrick's.  No, no, no.  Anybody knows that, miss.  That was big news.  They know that in Thailand.  We got, we got news clippings from all over the world.  Something in the last six months.  How about name something we did on the radio last week?  Yeah.  One lousy thing we did on the.  You're killing me.  You're killing me.  Could be a guest we had on the show.  It could be anything.  Prove you're not a contest pig.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  Prove it.  You have a rock star guest on.  Oh, I can't think of a name.  What did you think?  A rock star guest.  That's good, considering we're on a lot of rock stages.  What did you think last week?  I feel like I have friggin' else.  What did you think last week of our George?  I'm on the radio with you.  All right.  You keep talking.  I was trying to help you.  What do you think of the George Clooney interview we did last week?  I can't think of anything.  I'm blank.  I'm blank.  All right.  Good.  You're a contest pig.  Give me my echo.  I'm not a contest pig.  I love you guys.  Don't do this to me.  I don't know.  Wait.  Bernadette. 
[01:08:00]  Bernadette.  Don't do this to me.  You say you love us.  Name one thing we've done on our radio show.  Prove you're not a contest pig.  Oh, girl.  You know what?  I feel like a friggin' contest.  But I'm not one.  I'm not one.  I listen to you all the time, but...  You're not listening exclusively just to win this prize.  No, that's not true.  That is not true.  So you were listening Friday.  I was listening Friday when you had the guy on the rock star.  I can't think of his name.  Isn't this a lot of fun? 
[01:08:30]  We had a rock star on Friday.  That's right.  I don't know.  No, you had a really good show.  You always have a really good show.  What am I?  You know.  You're a contest pig.  No, I'm not a contest pig.  Don't say that about me.  Sometimes...  You are a contest pig.  You guys are big.  Everybody listens to you.  Contest pig on the line.  No, not true.  You are a contest pig.  No, I'm not. 
[01:09:00]  No, I'm not.  Don't say that.  Go away, contest pig.  I don't want to go away.  Piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy.  On the line.  Oh, that's not true.  It's March of the Contest Pig Monday.  No, that's not true.  Don't say that.  So long, contest pig.  No, that's not true.  Oh, by the way, this is the sound you need to hear today. 
[01:09:30]  I heard the sound.  There you go.  Guess what?  You're not going to win, dummy.  See, that was it.  Huh?  That was the sound.  It wasn't wuss or uh or ah or bus.  I guess it's bus.  Bus, bus, bus.  It's a bus.  Bus.  Jen, New Jersey.  How are you today?  How you doing?  Hi.  What's up, Jen?  Jen.  Hello. 
[01:10:00]  Hi.  What can we do for you?  I've just fallen in for the word of the day or the free of the day.  Don't even know what to call it, do you?  Because you're a contest pig.  You're the first caller.  Thanks for checking in today.  Caller number one.  Hi.  Who's this?  Good morning.  This is Rob from Melville.  Hi, Rob.  Rob from Melville right out there on Long Island.  How are you guys?  Very good.  Melville is also, I believe, the home of mankind.

I'm a working stiff on my way to work.  I work for a fucking party department.  Hey.  And he's got a potty mouth.  You got a potty mouth.  Yeah.  Yes, I do.  I am sorry.  I'm on my way to work.  I haven't had coffee yet. 
[01:11:00]  You're working stiff.  I'm not a contest pig, but I'm a money pig because I don't make enough money.  And I heard the contest pig say that you're waiting for wuss.  Well, you better try to get some overtime.  You lost.  Let's go over to the next caller.  Hi.  His dream's up in flames.  You better call his buddies to put it out.  I'll live you.  Hi.  Who's this?  Uh, one, two, three.  That's official right there.  That's four.  Of course it is.  Hi.  Who's this?  Chuck.  Hi, Chuck.  How are you? 
[01:11:30]  We're doing pretty good this morning.  How are you?  I'm good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are we, uh, the phrase that pays today?  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  Hi.  Who's this?  Jack.  Hey, Jack.  You lost Jack.  I'm sorry.  Hi.  Who's this?  Got a cat named Jack.  Jack.  Steve from a short game.  Hi.  Who's this?  Yeah.  You're seven.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is Mike.  Mike.  You want to win a thousand dollars? 
[01:12:00]  Mike.  It'd be great, but I'm sure I'm calling number nine.  Uh, actually you're number eight.  Oh, that's gotta hurt.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hi.  This is Bernadette.  I can't give up.  Perfect.  Oh, that is, it couldn't have worked out better, Bernadette.  You are not gonna believe this.  Do you know what the odds are, first of all, of you even getting back through when all the  phones are ringing, Bernadette? 
[01:12:30]  Do you know?  Oh, my God.  Do you have the, uh, station number on speed dial?  Oh, my God.  This is perfect.  Bernadette.  Bernadette.  Don't hang up on me, please.  No, listen, do you know the odds of actually getting through again when all the lines are  busy?  Oh, I don't, but this is meant to be.  Do you have the number on speed dial?  No, I just try to get through again.  I'm on my way to taking my kids to school.  Well, let me tell you something.  You did indeed get through.  The prize has not yet been given away. 
[01:13:00]  We have been through many callers, uh, you know, caller one, caller two, caller three,  caller four, all, all these, uh, callers, five, six, and, uh, you've gotten through.  What caller do you think you are?  I wish I was caller ten.  Caller ten is that big number.  That's the caller that will get $1,000 in cash.  $1,000.  That's a lot of money, Bernadette. 
[01:13:30]  Bernadette, what would you do with $1,000?  I would be so happy.  I'll remember everything you guys say.  What would you do with $1,000?  I'd freaking listen every day.  Look, you don't need money to listen to us, uh, on the regular radio.  What would you do with $1,000?  Probably go to the dentist for this frigging toothache I have right now, listening to you  say what you know.  This is going great.  Pretty sad, huh? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, if you gotta spend it on the dentist, I would spend it on something a little more  fun, maybe the kids, something you like.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  Are you ready for this, Bernadette?  Don't bust me.  You are caller number...  Nine!  Nine!  You missed by one! 
[01:14:30]  You get nothing!  You lose!  You better lose.  Aww.  She hung right up, by the way.  Yeah.  She's trying to call back and be the next caller.  So long, contest pig.  So long.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Mark.  Hey, Mark.  Where are you calling from?  From Bloomfield. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, you just won $1,000.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  All right.  Hold on a line.  All right.  Thanks.  That's today's winner right there, line two.  Yeah.  We'll be back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Rock and roll!  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we'll do the dentist story in a minute or two here. 
[01:15:30]  Also, we've got to set up the contest for tomorrow.  Another $1,000 tomorrow, right, Am?  Yes.  Another $1,000.  I want to play this again.  RPI sent this in.  We're looking for the listeners and their production as far as the contest goes.  Trying to come up with a clever name or just some silly production pieces revolving around the fact that we're giving away $1,000 a day for the next month.  Indeed.  I think we've got another month of this contest.  This is what RPI submitted over the weekend. 
[01:16:00]  Hi, who's this?  We have come up with the simplest contest you can do.  It's so easy.  Oh, it needs a fancy name.  It's the Opie and Anthony prize pig extravaganza.  Hi, who's this?  Here's the deal.  O&A tell you the sound clip.  They're going to play between 7 and 7.30 a.m. Eastern Time.  You be the 10th caller at 1-877-212-O-AND.  That's 1-877-212-O-AND. 
[01:16:30]  You better try it right now to make sure it works.  I just wanted to kick that at the right phone number.  And you guys thought we were joking about people being stupid.  I just put a big loser on my head.  I just called the number to make sure that it was the right number for the contest.  I hate you.  If you're the 10th prize pig to call in, you win.  A grand-a-roomy.  A cool grand.  A thousand-buck-a-roomy.  So then, you'll not only be a prize pig, you'll also be a...  There you go. 
[01:17:00]  There you go.  It's amazing how most contests that radio stations run are meant to get the listeners  and make them happy with the station and the show.  And we just use it as a vehicle to bash.  To bash contest pigs.  I have a shot.  Well, you know why?  I'll tell you why.  Because the reason we are doing this contest, yes, you get people, maybe you get new fans.  New listeners.  Absolutely. 
[01:17:30]  And, you know, that will be accomplished.  Some people will tune in just because they know we're giving away $1,000.  And something will hit them where they're like, wow, this show's kind of good.  I'm going to start listening a little bit to this show.  Yeah.  But there's also contest pigs.  They will never listen to this show.  Never.  No, they're here for the purpose of winning that money, and that's it.  That broad Bernadette will never listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  No girl named Bernadette will listen to this show.  She'll listen for the next month, hoping to get $1,000, and then after the contest is 
[01:18:00]  over, she's going to find the next radio station that has some kind of contest going  on, and she'll listen to that show for a while.  She probably looks like one of the Abbott and Costello pig mice.  Remember the little mice?  Hey, Babbitt!  Yeah.  That's probably what she looks like, just a little fat mouse.  And I think RPI has her in the sweeper, the promo we just played.  It sounds like the single Bernadette we just messed up.  So she's called before.  Yeah.  Braxton from Cleveland. 
[01:18:30]  You guys have got to be the only show in the history of radio to spend three minutes on  the losing call and ten seconds on the winner.  Jay from Boston, I'll say it again, that this contest is the best radio contest ever, not  because some loser wins $1,000, but just the way you guys present it.  I'm not trying to be funny or add to the show.  I'm just giving you guys props.  Props?  Who says props?  He writes.  Propellers.  And Chris Cox there from L.A., loving what we did to Bernadette.  Classic.  I'm crying.  That was so effing fun.  I'm absolutely crying over here. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, why are the phones all lit up?  It just doesn't end.  It doesn't end.  Does it amaze you at this point?  No.  No.  Now I'm not even amazed anymore.  So you want to use Jimmy for the sound tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy had a great HBO special over the weekend.  Yep.  A great hour this past Saturday night.  Nothing but props.  Thank you.  Great reviews coming in.  And it's going to be available on DVD tomorrow.  Tomorrow, yes.  So in honor of that, tomorrow, when you hear this. 
[01:19:30]  This is called the greeting of a horse's ass.  When you hear this tomorrow, between 7 and 7.30, here's the sound.  Yeah.  Now what's wrong with this, though?  No, that's not it.  All right.  Hold on.  This sound.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jim Norton.  Thank you, Ro.  Thank you.  The sound.  It's Sal.  Thank you.  When you hear that.  Where's Joseph? 
[01:20:00]  When you hear that between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow, that's when you call to try to win the $1,000.  The phone number is 877-212-ONDA.  And we'll take the 10th caller tomorrow.  When you hear this, between 7 and 7.30.  Not now.  Thank you.  Eastern time.  7, 7.30, Eastern time.  You have to say that because somebody might be with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Chicago.  Chicago.  Indeed.  There's your buddy Ben Affleck on TV there.  Is he going to be on the CW11?  Why couldn't we get him in here? 
[01:20:30]  Maybe we can.  Maybe we can.  I got to ask you about that.  I saw the show.  Saw him on Leno.  Is he a little, I don't know.  Was he in a party atmosphere?  I don't know.  He appeared to be a bit...  Sauced.  No, I wouldn't say that.  Sauced.  He popped into my dressing room for a second. 
[01:21:00]  With no pants thinking it was his?  Exactly.  No, he just asked me if I wanted to audition for my next movie part.  Or first, actually.  Next, like there's been six El Zilcho.  No, we talked during the break, and he seemed like he was a little, like, you know, kind  of just cool, happy, you know?  Yeah, because he came out, and he was talking to Jay, and he seemed a little happy, and like  he's telling his story, and he did a good job, but he was just a little... I've seen 
[01:21:30]  that before, in the mirror.  I know what that looks like.  What does it look like?  Like he looked.  A little, you know, your eyes are a little at half-mast.  You're kind of talking a little weird, you know?  What is it, booze, pills?  What is it?  I don't know.  Look, it could have been a few drinks.  And maybe it's over-the-counter cold medicine. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  But Jimmy's not talking.  No, I couldn't tell, actually.  Jimmy's not talking.  I was too busy whoring this show.  I was like, you've got to come on the radio show.  Good boy.  I was telling him on the break, I'm like, look, the publicists will never put you on.  They're afraid of us.  I'm like, talk to Kevin Smith.  You're friends with him.  You know, he comes in at 6, he hangs to 11.  I'm like, we'll give you a great interview.  We'll have a good time.  He's a fun guy.  I mean, he'd probably be great to interview.  He's not uptight.  No, he was great.  How long do you think it took him to forget that he even talked to you? 
[01:22:30]  Before we walked over to see the band.  Although he was chit-chatting with me, I kept losing him.  Oh, no.  He would talk to me.  Here's the way it works with somebody that famous.  When they talk to you, your basic job is to go, yeah, okay.  Or to add one thing that will segue them into what they want to say next.  When you try to, like, add something, basically their head just turns.  They just walk away.  I have no charisma with famous.  I really don't.  Geez.  I don't.  No.  Because they're not real people.  That's why.  Well, no, I just don't have any.  You got charisma when it comes down to regular people, Jimmy.  And that's how it should be. 
[01:23:00]  Screw those asses.  He was being polite.  He was very cool.  But then all of a sudden, I guess I might get carried away, though.  Like, I may talk a little more than I would with a regular guy.  And that just turns them off.  Like, they're like, oh, yeah, he's not in the club.  Little things give away, you're not in the club.  Yeah.  Besides the fact they've never seen you before.  That's one indicator.  Do you really want to be in that club?  Yes, I do.  The actual club of hanging out with people?  More than anything.  Sure do.  Bennifer and Jim, whatever my girl's name would be.  Oh, right.  Really?  Yes.  Wait, what kind of girl name would I have? 
[01:23:30]  Jim-a something.  Jim-a something.  Jim-a.  You know?  Jim Annie.  Jim Annie.  Jim Bob.  No.  I know.  I understand.  That's just hurtful.  Yeah, of course.  It would be fun to hang out with those people, even though most of them are stiff.  But you don't know how to communicate with them or anything.  I don't.  No.  Sometimes you get it on a much lower level, because we have some notoriety, and you get 
[01:24:00]  it on some lower level, and it kind of gives you a little bit of an understanding.  I definitely appreciate, last night, I was at the Outback, last night, local, and their  chicken is pretty good.  But I'm at the Outback, and I'm sitting there with a mouth full of wild rice, and some guy  comes over and goes, are you on the Opie and Anthony show?  And I turned with a full mouth and went, not right now. 
[01:24:30]  And he just gave me the love to the show and everything, as I'm trying to swallow my  rice.  And when I got there, I was just like, thanks a lot.  Thanks for listening.  And then he said, oh, sorry for bothering you.  I just wanted to say hi.  I was like, oh, that's cool.  And then he left.  But it's kind of odd to be sitting there with just a mouth full of food and have someone  appear at your table to talk to you.  I had a psycho one down there in Philly at the Flyers game, walking around a little bit, 
[01:25:00]  and a girl comes up to me and goes, do you like turtles?  I like turtles.  Oh.  And I'm like, yeah, I like turtles.  You like turtles, right?  Yeah, I like turtles.  Yeah, I thought you liked turtles.  I like turtles, too.  And it kept going back and forth.  I'm like, all right, I get it.  You get the game.  I get it.  You're a fan of the show.  Right, you know that bit.  Yes, thank you.  Was she 100% sure it was you?  That might have been her code word to not make an ass out of herself and go, hey, are you  Opie?  Or she probably thought she wasn't blowing up your spot. 
[01:25:30]  I think it had something to do with the boyfriend saying that that was me and she didn't believe  it, so she went up.  Yeah.  I don't believe this.  And that was her way of trying to figure out if it was me.  I don't know.  But it was just a turtle conversation for like 30, 40 seconds.  And it was just like awkward for both of us.  Sounds hideous.  And then I grabbed some peanuts and went back up to my seat.  Hey, big boy made a duty, didn't you, Dan?  Sure did.  Dan's back.  Wow.  Oh.  Dan said he needed five minutes.  But he did tell us.  I've been waiting for this day. 
[01:26:00]  Let me tell you.  For at least a month.  Maybe longer.  Waiting?  You've been asking.  Dan has a mother update finally.  I ask him all the time, how's mother?  And he says he doesn't know.  But finally today, he knows.  Right?  Well, because.  He doesn't know because.  They have this rift that's been going on for quite some time.  Quite some time.  A beef.  A beef.  Sorry, I just got to bounce another Arab jacker.  Oh, God. 
[01:26:30]  I love these guys.  Yeah, there's been a beef with his mom ever since, I guess, the divorce with dad.  Yeah.  Maybe even beforehand.  Because she, Than likes and appreciates his dad.  And his mom apparently, from what we've heard Than say, does a little of that bashing.  Which is like the worst thing divorced parents could do.  I mean, believe me, you got to, you can't be that selfish where you bash the other person in front of the kids. 
[01:27:00]  It's nothing but self-serving.  It's trying to make you look better in front of the kids.  And all it does is F the kids up when they have to hang out with the parents.  Because all they're thinking is the awful things you said.  So, you know.  Well, let's be fair, though.  Than also blames mother for the divorce.  Mother.  Yes.  Yes.  It's not mommy or mom.  It's mother.  Mother.  Which is downright creepy.  The last person to use mother was Norman Bates.  And we know how that ended. 
[01:27:30]  Right.  With the wig.  Let's get a mother update from Than.  M is for the million things she gave me.  This is your mother's song.  Oh.  Who means only that she's growing old.  Growing old.  Not fast enough.  T are for the that fed me.  And C is for the door that I fell out of. 
[01:28:00]  What are we up to?  E.  E.  E is for the ears that dad used to hold.  And R is for the retard they aborted before me.  R is for the ripe plum tomato.  That was to be my brother.  All together let's have a mother. 
[01:28:30]  Oh.  Would that mean the world to me.  Not enough of the mother song.  Is this Shirley Temple?  Who is it?  Sounds like some guy.  Like a young boy or something.  Young boy.  Oh dear.  I don't know who that is.  What do you got?  It's young E-Rod.  Good call.  That's little Bobby Breen from the 1940s. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  That's good.  And that was little Bobby Breen.  Let's give him a big hand here on the RCA radio network.  That's back when older black men would call little white kids Mr. and Mrs.  And that's a good one.  Miss Shirley.  You done good Miss Shirley.  Mr. Bobby sings fine.  Oh my goodness.  Yes.  Up next little Bobby Breen will sing about father.  F is for the  Mm-ing asshole.  Oh dear. 
[01:29:30]  It's very hard to do when you're doing curses without the peeps.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's also for the FCC, pal.  It's true.  All right.  Let's get a mother update.  Happy last night here too.  Dan?  What happened with the mother?  Well, I still haven't talked to her.  But...  Well, the last time you talked to her, you were in Nantucket having one of those nice meals.  Yes.  In Nantucket with mother.  I called her a sociopath.  And she walked out and said, I hope you have enough money to pay for this really nice dinner  we were having.  Mm-hmm.  And it must have been a pretty expensive dinner. 
[01:30:00]  It was $400 or something like that?  Yeah, at least that.  Yeah, at least $400.  That's definitely going to hurt.  So you haven't talked to her since.  So what's up?  So I went through my sister as my liaison, and I said, how's mother?  How's mother?  And she said, this is the update.  Mom is okay.  She is very bitter about what happened with you guys.  Oh.  Bitter? 
[01:30:30]  Wait, or sad?  Wait, she's bitter?  She's not like sad or never giving?  Bitter is different.  That would imply...  Or taking responsibility?  No, that would imply a capacity for remorse, which is vacant.  Oh, there's no capacity for remorse.  No.  That's one of my big points of attention.  So she's bitter.  She's bitter.  She's spun it like she gave up a potential career to stay home with you. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  Like to raise you?  Yes.  What was the potential career?  And then in parentheses, she was in night school getting her MBA when she was pregnant  with you.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Mother's rough.  Mm-hmm.  I hate when mothers use that crap on you.  It's like you had a choice in the matter.  Absolutely.  Look, man, you took the you-know-what in your you-know-what.  Could have had a career, Norman.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:31:30]  She's using a bit of that guilt, huh?  Yes.  And then the final sentence is, and that she should have just gone to work.  Oh, wow.  She shouldn't even bother spending time with me.  Yeah.  Because apparently as an emotional investment, I haven't paid off in love.  Oh.  Oh.  That's my own editorializing.  You're down for the year.  Yeah.  Are you the one person in the family who kind of calls her on being that way?  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Like everyone else kind of kowtows to her and tiptoes around her moods, and you're basically  like you're a sociopath who's devoid of anything.  Yes.  Okay.  That's probably why she has a problem with you.  Yeah.  I don't know why I thought I'm a psychologist figuring out that obvious.  Yeah, right.  Right, Sigmund Freud.  Good one.  I know.  Sigmund dope.  So that's the mother update right there.  Mm-hmm.  Whew.  And this was through a second party, of course.  Yeah, this is through an email through my sister.  Oh, okay.  So now what happens? 
[01:32:30]  Well-  Do you reach out?  You got to respond to that.  I, what, directly to her or through my sister?  Through your sister.  Through the, yeah, sister.  Yes.  Sister, older?  Intermediary.  Older sister.  Older sister.  How would you respond to something like that?  Then why'd you have me?  Yeah, why did you take the, you know what?  That seems like the answer of a, no offense.  A child.  But that's the answer of a child when, you know, they're like, you know, what are you  doing?  Why, you know, you're aggravating me. 
[01:33:00]  Then why'd you even have me?  But what else is he supposed to say?  But she's being a child by saying, I shouldn't have had you.  That's kind of asking for it.  He had nothing to do with this decision she made.  Oh.  Yeah, it sounded like I was three and I was like, thanks for hanging out, Mom, but don't  you think you should pursue your dreams?  Right.  Right.  She made the big sacrifice and the choice there.  Yeah.  It didn't turn out for her, that's all.  I wouldn't respond to her.  She has a lot of regrets.  No.  No response.  Well, my poor sister's like, do you think you guys could patch things up by Thanksgiving? 
[01:33:30]  I want to have everybody over.  Oh, please patch it up just so we can have a fun hour on the radio.  Well, does your sister agree with your analysis or no?  Yes.  Okay.  So why does she kiss her ass instead of just saying?  She's actually the middle of the road.  My oldest older brother, he tends to be my mom's friend the most.  My sister's in the middle and I'm the sworn enemy.  But does your father, does you and your older brother get along?  Yeah.  And does your older brother like your father?  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  So there are some siblings that are able to have relationships with both parents.  But only by being like ostriches and, you know.  Oh, okay.  And eating even a minute.  You know, sometimes you just got to let her be her.  Oh, I see.  And you're not going to like.  No.  No one gets a free pass.  Wow.  I like the way you think.  Yeah.  You got to earn.  That's ballsy.  Other people's respect.  Yeah.  You're not going to sit there and just BS yourself.  No.  By sitting there and taking that kind of crap.  I have a weird feeling that he's more like his mom than his dad, though. 
[01:34:30]  And that's where the problem is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's why they don't get along.  Right?  You're more like your mom.  Absolutely.  Wow.  He'll admit that.  Yeah.  But I do recognize when I mess up.  I hope.  She doesn't.  Oh, okay.  And you probably got that from your father.  Yeah.  Wow.  All he did was wrong, apparently.  I love the mother update.  There's Than in the mother update.  All right.  We got Doug Stanhope.  He's joining the program next.  Hey, we got Star Wars Trumpet Girl.  It's more a video, but... 
[01:35:00]  Oh, this is our video of the day.  We've been watching this and just laughing our asses off.  Yeah, we'll play that next.  And we'll also talk about the dentist that has an unusual thing he likes to do to relax  the women in his office.  Yeah, as long as it relaxes them.  Yeah.  And what else?  Oh, the priest.  Yes.  Saying he wasn't gay.  The priest spy.  He was doing what?  Research or something?  Of course he was.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get into that story next.  A couple of really good stories still to do today on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:35:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Doug Stanhope, everyone.  Good morning.  Stopping by to say hi.  All cheery and ready to go, are you?  Yeah, I am.  I actually...  You're dressed for winter, I noticed.  What is winter?  Oh, it is cold.  It's not cold.  This isn't cold.  It's like 50-something.  He lives in New Mexico, right?  Arizona.  Yeah, for Arizona, it's cold.  At night, it gets cold out there.  Yeah, yeah.  It gets cold.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  But you don't go out at night.  Oh, hold on.  Outside.  Yeah.  I'm in a bar.  Yeah.  They say it's out, but it's in.  Yeah.  I'm going out tonight.  Not really.  Just going.  Drinking.  To a bar.  Yeah.  Are you playing Vermont, though?  I'm playing, yeah.  Like all the New England states this week.  Nice.  The New England tour.  Yeah.  Tonight is just in the Weathervane Music Hall in Brattleboro, Vermont.  Brattleboro.  Nice.  Just go to the weathervanemusichall.com for tickets.  Stan Hope tonight at 8 o'clock.  Where else are you at this week? 
[01:36:30]  Worcester, Boston, Narragansett, Rhode Island, and Manchester, New Hampshire.  Wow.  It's all on my MySpace or my website.  There you go.  You don't have to plug in.  And you got the easy MySpace, Doug Stan Hope, on MySpace?  Very good.  See?  There you go.  MySpace, I have a lot of friends, sorry.  Yeah.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Imus returns December 3rd on WABC.  Oh?  Drudge is reporting it officially that Imus is back.  We kind of got an email today.  We know what's happening. 
[01:37:00]  But now Drudge is reporting.  So it looks official.  He starts December 3rd.  Yeah.  The black journalists were coming out again instead of that they should stop talking.  They think a year is for a year.  It's good.  What a year?  What do they have?  The power of sentencing people now, too?  They're just guessing how long he'll live.  They figure a year I'll be dead.  It's like, what?  He'll be dead.  They not only feel they have the power to remove people, but then they can judge how long someone 
[01:37:30]  should be exiled.  Go screw yourself.  These are already people who've decided that they should be in charge of black people.  So why would they not say what they pass sentences for whatever?  They already deem themselves leaders of black people.  I'm sure most black people are going, I don't want Al Sharpton speaking on my behalf or any  of these clowns.  That's kind of the feeling we get.  Because they're not elected or anything.  We go out there and talk to the brothers and the sisters.  They're like, the brothers.  He don't represent me. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  That's what like everybody's saying.  I hear that a lot.  You know, there's this thing going on right now.  There's a lot of this in the news, the racist stuff.  They're saying that this is racism.  A lot of nooses showing up now, and they want that considered a hate crime.  And by the way, the noose hanging on the doorknob that happened the other day.  Columbia University.  University, yeah.  Columbia University, yeah.  That cannot be considered a hate crime.  Because for some reason, only swastikas and burning crosses are actually symbols that 
[01:38:30]  can be considered a hate crime that you can convict people for putting on.  Why not add a noose to that list?  Well, that's what they want to do.  But then, where does it stop?  Because a noose can mean anything.  It really can.  A noose doesn't necessarily mean a hate crime.  Do not disturb.  Yeah, exactly.  It's hanging on a doorknob.  Exactly.  Do not disturb.  Baby on board. 
[01:39:00]  I want to kill you.  But not for anything racial.  It's not associated with a race.  Like the swastikas against the Jews and the burning.  Why am I explaining what they are?  But of course, the lynchings of past, that kind of conjures up that image.  But the noose hasn't been used exclusively for that.  The noose has been around since before black people.  Right.  For Pete's sake.  They were executing people with the noose for quite some time.  Could just be you tied your shoes well.  Right.  It means they have a bunny over your shoes.  And then there's the N-word, which I just hate saying, was scrawled on a bench during 
[01:39:30]  a football game.  The visiting team comes in.  They're from a predominantly black school or from a few black schools.  And they're playing away.  And their bench, the visitor's bench, had the N-word on it.  The fact that that's news, that some idiot goes and does that, why is that news?  And scratches it in the...  You know what?  It was scratched into everything. 
[01:40:00]  So was every other racial slur.  So were swastikas.  So were Jewish stars.  So were everything.  It was what you did in school.  You scratched things in things.  You didn't even know what it meant.  Yeah, you didn't know what half the stuff meant.  You know, hatred was funny.  It was a joke.  It was something you just did.  I feel sorry for the white football team.  So they got their asses kicked is what happened.  Of course they did.  It just all I could think of was fast times at Ridgemont High.  Way to motivate the visitors.  Where they pissed off...  Oh, boy.  What's his name there? 
[01:40:30]  Forrest Whitaker.  Forrest Whitaker by crashing his car.  Yeah.  Pissing off Idi Amin.  I bet you that was actually the visiting coach who carved it in his own team.  Oh, this one got him all riled up.  So they removed the bench.  And the team had to stand up the whole game.  Oh, that would piss them off to the point that...  Yeah, they were really annoyed.  They're annoyed.  And then another incident was a swastika drawn on the inside of a toilet stall.  Now, if you...  Again, a stolen symbol that you... 
[01:41:00]  I forget the origins, but...  It was by a lot of people.  The American Indian used it.  Certain Asian cultures used it.  And it was a symbol of peace.  But, you know, I guess Hitler thought it looked cool.  He also thought the mic...  You turned it a little bit.  And where else for a symbol of peace but on the inside of a toilet?  Yeah.  And let me also tell you another thing about the inside of toilet stalls.  If that is not the last bastion of free speech, to be sitting there doing your business and actually remember that you have a pen on you, and then to just scribble something on the wall. 
[01:41:30]  That is real free speech.  What the hell rhymes with here I sit broken hearted?  I love saying gang graffiti in toilets where you go, do you claim this rest area toilet as your turf?  You want to lay claim to this?  I don't even want to put my feet in this.  Can't be a popular gang, that's for sure.  There's so much interesting stuff written on those walls. 
[01:42:00]  And occasionally you will get the racial slur and the swastika will be there.  But to then call in the cops and call it a hate crime is so beyond reality.  It's not a hate crime.  A hate crime should be kept to what it is.  A crime based on hatred of somebody for who or what they are.  I enjoy the sketches of male genitalia. 
[01:42:30]  Who doesn't?  Especially when you go in there, there's such...  Wow, you must know a lot about this because the detail in this one is just horrific.  You get the primitive ones, but then you get the guy that, man, he's in there for a while making sure he gets all the detail right.  Yeah.  I like the stick figure with the giant one.  Right.  I love those.  Giant hanging ones.  Yeah, giant.  It looks like it's probably about like a foot long and the stick figure is like six inches high.  It's like that's the way it should be.  You know what else happened recently? 
[01:43:00]  The defense department building from the air, they noticed.  And because of Google imaging, they noticed it was shaped like a swastika.  This building complex from the ground, you can't see crap.  It looks like buildings.  Right.  But from the air and these Google searches that people find a bunch of really cool stuff, noticed, oh, my God, this building looks like a swastika.  And they told the defense department, who then spent, I don't know how much money, redoing it so it wouldn't look like a swastika from the air. 
[01:43:30]  It's symbolism over substance at that point.  You're spending money to change a building that had nothing to do.  No one knew or cared that it was shaped like a swastika.  Jewish aliens care.  That's why they haven't landed.  Coming on their ships.  You realize we have Doug Stanhope here today.  Jewish aliens.  He understands the alien culture.  I didn't think about the feelings of Jewish aliens. 
[01:44:00]  I'm sorry.  You are right.  And you never will because they'll never land now.  Now they're all PO.  They were probably flying.  Look, we got all these secrets of eternal life.  Let's give them to this.  Oh, look.  Oh, Murray, look at that building.  How inhospitable.  Let's go to James in New Hampshire.  James.  I'd just like to stop the show so that we can all bask in Obie's line of the day.  Oh.  It was glazed over.  The noose can also mean baby on board. 
[01:44:30]  Commendable.  Wow.  Doug kind of chuckled.  I was just talking about other things that could be a felony if you had them, like baby  on board.  It really wasn't that good, sir.  Well, the center cog of the show would definitely be noticed.  Why did I go to your phone call to make myself feel better?  I love when they point out things.  I had some guy that pointed out a bad hack joke I made the other day.  He's like, you missed a great line from Anthony.  I was like, no, I'm trying to cover that up.  Stop it. 
[01:45:00]  It was a juvenile attempt at humor that failed miserably.  Here's the noose story, by the way.  While the NYPD Hate Crimes Unit continues to investigate two other incidents that happened  last week, state lawmakers are calling for action.  You may recall last week a noose was hung outside a professor's door at Columbia Teachers College  and another on a pole outside a firehouse near Ground Zero.  A proposed bill would make hanging a noose in a public place a felony.  This noose represents an underlining crime and our underlying stupid clear and strong message 
[01:45:30]  that it is unacceptable and it won't be tolerated.  And if you do it, we want you to go to jail.  Now, please do not believe the discovery of the two nooses last week are related.  You know, I blame the media also here because now you're going to see swastikas and nooses  and all this stuff all over the place.  How could you make hanging a noose somewhere a felony?  First of all, how can you even do that?  It's not a hate symbol. 
[01:46:00]  It really isn't.  It all depends on the context.  If you hang it on a black person's house, then perhaps you mean something else.  How are they continuing the investigations?  They said we're continuing into this week.  Following on fingerprints from the news.  Even if you find it to be a hate crime,  don't you think there's enough crime in this city that should be investigated by a limited  police force that you would say, all right, hey, that's bad.  Stop doing it.  But stop investigating it and get on maybe in a jail deduction or something. 
[01:46:30]  Can you do that?  We have really figured out how to get around the Constitution, man.  Now you got hate speech.  You got hate crime.  Hate speech is the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.  When you have a Constitution that ensures the free speech of people.  Even if it's an awful speech.  Yeah, and it doesn't matter what you're saying or who you're hurting.  You can hurt people's feelings.  It's not – hate speech is speech. 
[01:47:00]  You say whatever you want.  Hate speech is the liberal's way.  And the conservatives have religious nonsense.  Hate speech is the liberal's way of saying, I don't like what you're saying and I don't want you to say it.  That's all it is.  That's all – I don't like it and I don't want you to say it.  Yeah.  It's a way around the Constitution, my friends.  Hey, a lot of –  Okay, so if you hate on an individual basis, like I just hate you.  Right.  Like the guy you were talking about in the green room, I hate his guts.  Yeah.  Would you not –  It has to be somebody of the same race as you.  There has to be two or more before you – 
[01:47:30]  I don't think a white –  Yeah, I don't think a white person can hate a black person just because he's an ass.  Like you can't just like that guy is the biggest dummy jackass.  And then all of a sudden –  Why?  What does that mean?  No, he's just a jerk.  Yeah, it's like you can't not want to sleep with a girl just because she has no legs.  Right?  All right, then. 
[01:48:00]  Exactly.  I get his point.  No legged women rule.  No resistance.  No running away.  You're mean if you don't want to sleep with them.  Oh, because I have no legs?  Well, no.  Maybe I just don't like you as a person.  But don't the legs mess it all up because it's like a dog pushing a biscuit across the kitchen floor.  No, you put baby oil on her finger so she can't claw away off the one.  You need some –  I think those legs serve a purpose during sex.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Keeps everything anchored down.  A lot of people, Halloween displays and nooses.  Are they going to get arrested now?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happens.  Halloween, a lot of nooses go up.  It's a display.  It's a boo, scary kind of a thing.  I think there will be more problem with black people knocking on suburban doors in masks at night.  Believe me, that's nooses.  I have that story when I was living in Great Neck out on Long Island, a lovely Jewish neighborhood. 
[01:49:00]  I love living amongst the Jews.  They're wonderful people.  Nice lawns are well kept.  The streets are nice.  Everything's wonderful amongst the Jews.  They really know how to keep a nice property.  So I move right in.  I'm the only one with Christmas decorations.  Not a lot of good conversations.  No, I don't care about that.  I just, I whipped the frigging garland around columns and light Christmas lights and Santa Claus  and they just drive by like with a little menorah in their window.  Dude, can you go real obnoxious this year? 
[01:49:30]  I know last year you went pretty obnoxious, but this year you got to go.  This year I am.  You got to have one of those houses where everyone finds out about it and there's like a line of cars  driving in your neighborhood to check it out.  They do that already, believe me.  Anatomically correct reindeer.  Yeah.  Swing.  I had a guy the other day dropping off from one of the grocery delivery services and he  was writing the demo.  So he comes to the door and he's kind of looking at me.  So I sign the thing and give it to him. 
[01:50:00]  He goes away.  The truck comes back 10 minutes later.  He's already made the delivery and I've signed for it.  Transaction done.  The other guy, his buddy that was in the truck, comes to the door and goes, we just wanted  to make sure it was the right street address because my buddy thinks it's the cross street.  I was like, no, it's the street address.  He goes, oh, okay.  Just check in.  Like his buddy went, dude, that's Anthony. 
[01:50:30]  Get out of here.  All right.  We need a good excuse.  Why should I go to the door?  We'll say it's the wrong street.  Like I had it all figured out and then it gives you exactly why he can't, he looks at  you a little too long and I just shut the door.  Wham, go away.  But I was living in great neck for a while and it was Halloween and my girlfriend bought  a lot of candy because it was the first time we hadn't lived in an apartment.  We live in an actual house in a nice neighborhood and she's like excited to have little kids  come by and give them candy and look at their little costumes and stuff like that. 
[01:51:00]  Well, we got this candy.  And the festivities start, hear the doorbell ring.  Apparently, what goes on is a lot of underprivileged urban families will drive or take the bus to  nice neighborhoods to get good candy.  So we opened the door and there were about, I would say, five to eight little black kids 
[01:51:30]  coming to the door, all fighting each other to get to the door.  So my girlfriend comes out with it and she's got a huge bowl of just assorted candy and  they're grabbing at it.  One kid took his bag, put it on the ground, tipped the bowl over and took his arm.  He did a swipe move with his arm and took half of it and then like ran off.  I've seen that same move on YouTube in jewelry stores.  And the jewelry, it is, it's the jewelry store wife. 
[01:52:00]  Oh my God.  I always wondered where they, you know, practiced that move.  We shut the door and started laughing our asses off.  We were laughing hysterical.  And I think about 80% of the kids that came to the house that night was the exact same  thing.  I can't remember the last time any kid has come to any place I've been on Halloween.  Like I live in a small town now, but I haven't been there for Halloween yet.  I'm going to be there this year. 
[01:52:30]  And I was talking, I mean, kids actually go out and do that still?  Yeah, I think it's kind of a nice thing and then they go out with their parents.  Now it's safe trick-or-treating where you like take your kid trick-or-treating in the  local town or like on a local block.  With a big group.  With a big group.  Parents.  Or at the mall.  My buddy Greg shows up in Alaska and they'll have like a high school gymnasium where all  the like local shops will set up like fake like house fronts where they take the kid  to the gym, you know, the gymnasium and they go. 
[01:53:00]  It's all safe stuff.  Yeah, it's all fake.  Yeah.  It's plumbing, it'll have a little display, a fake house and give out candy and stuff.  And children, if you go around the back of the house, you'll realize there isn't really  a back of the house.  This is what we call a facade.  You are now going to see, oh, is this Amity Island?  Yes, you're going to see the shark from Jaws any minute now.  One of those horrible leave it to beaver houses.  We got to take a quick break.  When we get back, we got to play Star Wars Trumpet Girl. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  The video is great if you want to play along.  If we don't talk about the dentist, then we just aren't, we're just not doing our job.  Shirking our responsibility.  Don't stand hope in wherever the F you are tonight.  I don't know.  Go to his MySpace page, please.  I have to mention something I forgot.  He gave us 12 dates to plug.  New England all week.  How about that?  Find it.  Yeah, find it.  I'm everywhere in New England.  At least he said new.  Yes, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  I forgot to mention, tonight I'm at the Gotham Comedy Club.  I'm not performing.  I'm doing an interview show. 
[01:54:00]  This guy, Ray Allen, it's called Late Night with Ray Allen, and Richard Belzer's on the  show.  It's just an interview show.  So if you're around Gotham, come tonight.  You don't even have to do comedy anymore.  No, but I'm just saying.  You just show up and do interviews.  You're becoming a huge, huge star right in front of our eyes.  I'm still a nobody.  Oh, shut up.  You're going to be huge.  That HBO special is going to take you to the next level.  Everyone knows that now.  It's going to galvanize me into 200 seaters.  Hey, speaking of Jim Norton, before we go to break, this is the sound you've got to listen  for tomorrow if you want to win $1,000.  Tomorrow.  Don't call me out.  This sound right here. 
[01:54:30]  Thank you.  When you hear that tomorrow, between 7 and 7.30, if you're the 10th caller, you're going  to win $1,000, courtesy of us.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony.  All right, let's talk about Star Wars, girl.  Playing the trumpet here.  It's more of a video.  Yeah, it's a visual thing.  Well, it is a video, but it's more something you should watch the video instead of listening  to it on the radio.  But I think a little taste isn't going to hurt anybody. 
[01:55:00]  By the way, it's Opie and Anthony.  We'll throw this up on onaradio.com.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  He's doing the show rundown.  We'll make sure this link is up there so you can check it out later.  But basically, it's what?  Some kind of beauty pageant?  Yeah, it seems like there's some kind of real local beauty pageant from...  I mean, do you got any clue of what year this could be, Tham?  It looks like maybe the late 70s, early 80s.  Oh, really?  Well, look at the hair, man.  I'm thinking, why would you do a Star Wars thing if it was...  I thought it was recently.  Probably 80s. 
[01:55:30]  Really?  I'm going to go...  I'm going to go Ozzy in the Shot in the Dark video.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to go mid-80s.  Wow.  Yeah?  Well, it could be.  I mean...  I'm going to go 80...  It's pretty bad.  I'm going to go right at 85.  Yeah?  You're going to keep it in the middle somewhere around there?  Yeah, right at 85.  Whatever.  I'm going to slip slide with an 88.  Ooh.  I'm going to go early, though.  I was going to say 84.  Ooh.  I haven't seen it.  I can't guess.  Oh, Doug.  Way to be responsible.  Just guess.  Just guess.  I'll go 96.  It doesn't really matter.  96.  Very good.  It's grunge.  Because in the end, who gives the ass? 
[01:56:00]  Who cares?  The real treat of this video, and it's up on YouTube, just put in, what, Star Wars Trumpet  Girl, and it'll come up.  Well, we wanted to get people to go to Steven S. from Bayshore's show rundown.  It'll be there, too.  Oh, it'll be there, too.  ONAradio.com.  It's like the ONA Basics there on that website.  They'll go there and see it.  Okay.  But this girl, she's apparently in some kind of a pageant.  I don't know if it's a beauty pageant or some kind of talent thing, and she's in an awful 
[01:56:30]  80s dress, awful 80s hair, and her talent, apparently, is the trumpet.  She plays the trumpet, and she's playing along with the Star Wars music, the famous Star Wars  song.  And the trumpet is nowhere near in the right key for the background music that is playing.  So it just sounds horrible.  And in between, if you get a chance to watch this video, in between her actually playing, 
[01:57:00]  she's doing dramatic moves from the movie, using the trumpet as a blaster, kind of lurking  around corners like Han Solo would.  And that's what's great about YouTube and Break.com.  This stuff, someone just filmed this.  Oh, yeah.  Showed it to their friends, maybe 10 people.  20 people might have saw this over all those years.  And maybe even the woman, maybe the girl that's in the video even saw it, was like, oh, God,  who would ever see this?  And then technology changes, and now we get to see all this horrific stuff from the old 
[01:57:30]  days.  Dude, this video has over 600,000 views.  It'll go over a million today.  It is too good.  Well, here's the taste.  Guess when she comes in, by the way.  You can't even see it.  It's seamless.  Because people are like, why are you playing this?  It sounds great.  No, you'll know when she pops in.  It's so incredibly bad. 
[01:58:00]  It sounds like a car horn.  She plays the car horn.  It sounds like a marching band, like tuning up before the parade.  Oh. 
[01:58:30]  Now, look.  She's using her trumpet like a blaster.  She's acting out the Princess Leia role.  Yeah.  Because she's not playing right now, so she had to do something.  Okay, here it comes back.  All right, now she comes back on, right?  Wonderful.  Is this the greatest video?  You have to see the moves she makes, the dramatic moves, and she pops it up to her mouth.  Oh. 
[01:59:00]  Right back in.  And right back into the most out of key.  All right.  No, she still probably looks back at this as her shining moment.  Oh, yeah.  Well, now it's openly mocked on the internet.  This was huge for her.  Yeah.  She probably rationalized it, too.  Like, no, I know it's, like, off-key and everything, but I'm really there with every note.  Yeah, she probably won't watch the video because she doesn't want to spoil her bogus, whitewashed memory of the whole thing.  Right.  Oh, now, look. 
[01:59:30]  She does a little dance now during the cantina scene music.  Oh, my God.  This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Dude, look at this dance.  It's horrific.  It's almost like a river dance thing.  Now she's kicking her feet up in that I just quit smoking click your heels thing.  Oh, and then she did kind of like a Charlie Chaplin, like, silent movie dance there.  And then she...  This looks like community auditions in Boston, Massa, with Dave Maynard.  Do you know that show? 
[02:00:00]  Star of the day, who will it be?  She looks like Nancy Allen.  Yeah, actually.  Yeah, a little bit.  Blow out and dress to kill.  Oh, here's the big finish or no?  And they crank the music during this just to drown her out a little more.  Well, the big finish, she doesn't even play.  She's doing a lightsaber move.  Yeah.  She does a spin.  And she's done.  And a bow.  And she's done.  And walks off to what appears to be no applause whatsoever.  No, no.  Should be a round of machine gun fire. 
[02:00:30]  The link for that video will be up on onaradio.com later today when Stephen S. from Bayshore does  his show, Rundown.  In the middle of that, she should just be instantly served with a subpoena from George Lucas.  Absolutely.  He should come out on stage and just slap her with a subpoena and walk off.  He should tape it to his fat face and his weak chin and then yell at her because she's  not a kid's toy that he can market.  Headbutter with that giant head of his. 
[02:01:00]  He's just awful.  Hey, Matt W. from Connecticut.  Is this the talent show from Napoleon Dynamite?  Is that a train from Staten Island?  Sounds like a dying elephant.  Let's go to...  Speaking of which, we got to get that Bob Kelly audio from the wedding.  Yes.  He got married.  Our friend Bob Kelly.  Online.  Online.  We got an invitation and everything.  It was this big invitation.  You open it up and it goes, we'd like to welcome you to the marriage of. 
[02:01:30]  It's got everything like a real invitation.  Then it goes, log on to www.blahblahblah.  You log on and you got to put in code words and click on links and then it gives you a little  video window and you watch the wedding that way so they can go to Hawaii and you can sit  in your house.  That's nice, though.  They didn't waste your time.  You didn't have to show up and act like you care and dress up.  You're right.  It would be nice if it wasn't Hawaii because you're like, why couldn't you fly a few of  us then?  I mean, if it was your friend getting married in Staten Island, it would be perfect.  Exactly. 
[02:02:00]  You don't have to waste your time going to Staten Island.  You can watch on the internet.  Then, Doug, it would be perfect.  I mean, you fly yourself to Hawaii and not have to waste a whole Saturday doing something  boring watching people make out.  Come on.  You do have a point.  Yeah.  Hey, let's go to Tracy the trucker.  And if we don't talk about the dentist, you know, we're running out of show here.  Get the dentist story for me.  Tracy, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Love your show.  I thought it was Tracy a girl.  No.  You know better than that, Opie.  You tried that crap on me before. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  Wow.  What else is he trying?  I'm trying some crazy crap.  I see Tracy on the line and I think, girl, I'm sorry.  Opie, you're just a madman.  Boy, I'm outrageous.  I'm a shocker.  Shocker.  I'm going to be in really big trouble.  They passed that law because I go by hangman on the radio.  I got one hanging from my key ring, one from my turn signal.  Oh, a noose?  Oh, the hangman.  His name is.  Yeah, this guy loves the noose.  You got the hangman with you?  This is the hangman.  We got a smoky report.  Yeah.  Can you even play the game hangman anymore? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, no, you can't even play that.  N blank, G, G.  Hey.  Six letters.  Let me think.  God, sir, could you repeat all that?  We didn't hear it.  Yeah.  Why don't you keep running over the comedy as you barrel down the road?  Go ahead, sir.  Crystal meth.  Go ahead, sir.  Jesus.  What am I going to do when they passed this law?  I'm going to be screwed.  Why is that, buddy?  I'm kidding, sir.  We heard you the first time.  We get it.  We like nooses. 
[02:03:30]  Thank you, Tracy.  That's right.  You should get it.  Yeah, really.  A CB is more of a symbol of racism than any nooses.  Just having a handle, no matter what it is, means you're a racist.  Take the...  If you...  Yeah.  If you own a...  Breaker 1-9 is hate speech.  Hate speech.  That is funny, dog.  If you own a CB radio, take the racist quiz.  I think we're going to get a winner every time.  I never used to hear...  I was into CBs back when there was a huge CB craze. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, sure.  And never heard many brothers on the CB.  No, no.  A few truckers and stuff, but never many just recreational CB users.  Listen, this...  Yeehaw!  He's mounted down.  We can get into the CB talk, but this dentist story is...  Yeah, we got to get to the dentist.  Dentist claims breast rubs appropriate.  All right.  I see no problem now.  I'm going to...  You go into this with an open mind.  Dentist claims breast rubs appropriate. 
[02:04:30]  Very fair enough.  I think people in a lot of walks of life would say that they're appropriate.  Yeah.  A dentist accused of fondling the breasts of how many, you think?  One, two, four...  How many breasts?  Because then I got to double or divide by two.  Oh, boy.  Well, I got an odd number here, so we got a problem.  Nine women.  Okay, then it must be the women and not by the breast.  Okay.  Hopefully.  Unless he liked one better than the other.  I'm going to stick with 96 is my guess. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  It's got to be an odd number.  You would think after two, maybe three, all right, it's up.  You know, he's busted.  No, he was able to do this 27 to 27 female patients.  He gets too high, Doug.  Well, here's the thing.  If you're going to do that and say, hey, this is to help, you've got to do it to everybody  if you're going to have your story stand up.  You know, well, why'd you just squeeze the nice woods?  I didn't.  I squoze all 27.  Even if it makes your story a little more legit.  Yeah.  Even the old grandma coming in for a root canal. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  Yeah.  At least keep your story in check.  Keep them off your scent.  Right.  I'm even feeling up grandma.  You think I want to do this?  That's what I'm getting at.  A dentist accused of finally in the breast of 27 female patients is trying to keep his  dental license by arguing that chest massages are an appropriate procedure in certain cases.  Mark Anderson's lawyer says dental journals discuss the need to massage the pectoral muscles 
[02:06:00]  to treat a common jaw problem.  Come on.  Wow.  That's reaching.  That is reaching.  It's in a journal.  Tempo mandibular jaw disorder.  The jaw, the muscles.  See, I'm trying to.  Like, I'm straining my jaw as much as I can and it pretty much goes to the clavicle area.  It doesn't really go past that.  That's because you don't have the same problem that these poor women had that this heroic  doctor helped them prove.  Heroic. 
[02:06:30]  Heroic.  You know, they frown on all the Eastern medicines.  It's the HMOs that want you to believe.  Yeah.  All these drugs they advertise on TV when just a little herbal tea and a breast massage will  cure a lot of things.  You know, how come it takes Doug coming into the studio for me to realize, like, you know,  why am I against the dentist doing that?  He's absolutely right.  Why should I get in the way of his, you know, work? 
[02:07:00]  Am I?  I'm not a doctor.  I didn't go to medical school and dental school.  Maybe there is something that's to that.  I say you should squeeze him so hard her shoes fall off.  They got recorded phone calls from the dentist.  He said he didn't treat, yeah, TMJ, which caused his neck and head pain.  Attorney Robert Zaro told administrative law judge, blah, blah, blah, at a hearing Thursday  that he should let Anderson keep his dental license while disciplinary appeals proceed. 
[02:07:30]  Anderson would be supervised by two assistants and would no longer do the chest rubs.  My girlfriend went to get a mammogram and they scraped her teeth.  But you don't see that in the news.  You see?  You don't see that in the news.  There's no reason this guy should be touching a woman's breasts in the dentist's chair.  I know.  It might help TMJ.  Listen to this.  You squeeze him and she goes, hey, and her mouth opens real wide.  You got cured.  The lawyer is saying his dentist friend there that he's trying to defend needs to keep seeing patients 
[02:08:00]  so he can feed his seven children and pay for his defense.  So he still needs to work so he can pay the bills.  Lou suspended Anderson's dental license last month.  He was charged with two misdemeanor counts of battery and sexual battery.  YOLO County prosecutors are investigating complaints from more than two dozen women  who were groped in the examining chair in the last five years.  Now, here's what I want to know.  Are they anesthetized at the time they're groped?  Is there somebody, a nurse, a female nurse in the room when this is happening? 
[02:08:30]  And are they informed beforehand that he will be touching their breasts during this procedure?  If that's the case, then it's still completely wrong, but at least he has some type of defense he can mount in court.  And if there was something to this, wouldn't he maybe show on his own body and go, well, do this, it might help a little bit?  Yeah, or you massage it, or you have the female, like a hygienist, she massages it a little bit, or the husband comes in and does it. 
[02:09:00]  Anyone but him alone in the room with a knocked out patient.  When they're drilling your teeth, you ever have a dentist where they say, you know, like squeeze between your thumb and your index finger?  That's like a technique.  Do I look like I've been to a dentist in the last 20 years?  A technique to, you know, take away some of the pain.  A pressure point.  A pressure point.  Really?  So they'll show you, and they don't do it for you, though.  They go, look, if you do this, it might help a little bit while we're drilling away here. 
[02:09:30]  Three new complaints, including one from a 31-year-old woman who said Anderson fondled her at least six times over two years.  How does she wait two years and let him do it six times?  She took to, and this is how the story ends.  It's terrific.  She got fondled so many times.  She took to wearing tight shirts with high necklines.  How was she going back to the guy who was fondling her?  To try to get rid of the jaw disorder.  She took to wearing armor. 
[02:10:00]  Right.  It causes the jaw disorder because when you say, what are you doing, he punches you in the face.  I'm ready for this.  So she took to wearing tight shirts with high necklines, and Anderson would still get in under her shirt and bra, according to a picture point.  Oh, so, all right.  This guy was like, he really believed in this technique.  I didn't know it was under the bra.  Under the bra and everything?  See, that's, this guy really doesn't have much of a defense.  I know, but just that he could con 27 chicks into that?  But the funny thing is, like, you just, you gotta, no, no, go ahead. 
[02:10:30]  You just gotta respect his pitch.  I mean.  Yeah.  And if they're keeping their mouths shut for so long.  Yeah.  Jeez, two years, that woman.  A lot of people are saying, you gotta tell Doug about the perv switch.  I don't know if we have time today.  We're running out of show, and I just want to mention this really fast.  You go to Drudge Report.  It's official.  Imus is coming back to radio.  Yeah.  The resurrection of Imus returns on.  I'm coming back as a dentist.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:11:00]  Jerk.  He's gonna be, his home station's gonna be ABC here in New York City.  In a dramatic and dazzling career, rebound, controversial radio host Don Imus has secured  a deal returning him to the airwaves on December 3rd, this time on the nation's most listened  to talk station.  Imus in the morning will make high impact, will make high impact resurrection on ABC.  We'll have him on a standard 40 second delay.  Don is rested, humbled, and ready for war.  Specific terms of the deal will not be released. 
[02:11:30]  I'm just trying to read through this real quick.  Okay.  The stunning comeback is a defeat for those who protested and picketed Imus earlier this  year.  It absolutely is.  Yep.  The pushback has been gone.  Continue.  Come on, E-Rock, give me some more text.  What are you doing?  Imus is said to be particularly incensed by Senator Hillary Clinton's shameless exploitation  of the Rutgers situation.  The Senator, who Imus has called Satan and the Devil, traveled to Rutgers in April to praise  the women's basketball team for its response to the controversy in a campaign email. 
[02:12:00]  Hillary called Imus' comments small-minded bigotry and coarse sexism.  Hillary, prepare to meet your maker.  A source close to the host joked early Monday.  Station executives are still tinkering with the new schedule at ABC, which will likely  see current morning jock Curtis Lewa paired with late morning's John Gambling.  What are they sending Ron Coolby to do?  Defend more murderers?  Was Coolby going to be out?  Was Coolby going to be out?  This stupid beard?  Out there on the streets.  Good.  Defending people that just belong in the electric chair. 
[02:12:30]  How much does it help?  When you guys got tossed off the last time, how much did the publicity help, honestly?  It was great.  Does the music say this is the wrong time for a question?  You know, in the end, it really helped your radio show, that publicity, getting your face  all over CNN for, you know, two straight weeks.  It absolutely helps, as long as you keep your job.  The problem in the past with us, we F up, and they always fire us so you don't get to  reap the benefits of all that publicity you've got.  You don't get to bask in the publicity when you're sitting at home going, when am I going 
[02:13:00]  to work again?  But Imus is coming back, and we couldn't be happier here on the Opie.  You always have the CB.  How are you going to XM with us, man?  Coming over to XM?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  And Doug Stanhope on MySpace for all his dates.  He's playing all over New England.  Doug's great.  Absolutely.  I was burping there, but Doug is great, and go to MySpace for all his tour dates, but  he's doing New England for the entire week, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  All over the place.  Worcester.  Worcester, Mass, Saturday night.  Let's just plug that one.  That's my hometown.  Where's that? 
[02:13:30]  Worcester, Mass?  I know where.  Ralph's Chadwick Square.  I know where Worcester is.  Yeah, Ralph's.  Ralph's, okay, cool.  All right, guys.  If you're not joining us over at the other joint, have a good day.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's showtime. 
[02:14:00]  Ah.  Hey, Doug Stanhope made the walk.  Good morning.  For the filth-ridden portion of the show.  Yeah, some people, they say they're going to make the walk, and then all of a sudden,  they just, like, um...  Bail.  Make a quick left on 6th Avenue, and...  Where'd they go?  We don't see them until next time.  Do I have your mic on?  I don't hear them.  I don't hear them.  Check, check.  There he is.  Hey, there's Doug Stanhope.  All right.  Ah, here we go.  What's wrong, Anthony?  What's wrong?  Oh, nothing.  I'm just making sure everything here at Mission Control is working. 
[02:14:30]  Who's actually skipped out on the walk?  Ooh.  Otto and George?  You know what?  Otto likes to be dirty.  You know what?  I don't even...  Shock that cock.  Wow.  Cock sucker.  Jimmy has, uh, many times, um...  No, I've only...  Jimmy left.  I've only skipped on the walk when I had a flight to catch.  All right.  Sometimes I'll say I have a flight to catch the cock.  I was basically talking about Jimmy.  Oh, okay, but, uh, you didn't say, I'll be right there and never show up.  No, no, no.  Then I just pretend I got lost. 
[02:15:00]  There has been.  I can't remember who it was, but there have been a few people.  Very few, but it's happened where we've gotten here and gone,  wait, I thought they were going to come over for this part of the show.  No, they had enough.  We love naming names.  I just can't give you one.  I don't know.  I can't remember.  I'm not trying to protect anybody.  Oh, Paul Stanley, right?  But he did the walk with us to give away, like, his new CD.  He was a fun interviewer, too, but then he just hopped right into a limo  from the heat.  He stopped at the door.  Of course he did.  Hops in a limo and leaves.  Shicks on his cock.  What about the drummer from the police there, Stuart Copeland? 
[02:15:30]  Oh, I didn't...  I think he took the walk and then he took a walk.  Oh, did he?  I'm not sure, though.  I don't remember.  I know that fucking Andy Summers was up here.  Yeah.  Nice guy.  We get it.  The riff got stolen.  Dude, we are the worst.  We heard you.  I'm obsessed with the police and what they did to us.  They raped us good, man.  Jimmy and I had to go watch Sting perform the lute, and we did it partly out of a little  bit of interest because it's like a sting. 
[02:16:00]  Not because we wanted to hear the lute, but it was like, wow, we get a chance to see Sting?  Cool.  We'll do it.  But we're also thinking, all right, there were rumors about the police getting back together.  Maybe we'll start a little relationship.  He'll come on the show and talk about the police reunion, right?  So we did that.  Then we had Stuart Copeland.  He was plugging his DVD from his police years where he videotaped from behind the drum kit.  His shitty fun for everyone DVD that didn't show any fucking arguments, just a bunch of  playfulness.  Just a bunch of fun that the band was having. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, he was one of those guys that always had a camera with him the entire time.  So he had like a shitload of film, actual film and video of the band, and he threw it  together, and it was all just the uninteresting stuff.  Yeah.  If you're a hardcore fan of the police, there's an interest there, but in general, but he was  fun to talk to.  I mean, it was the tourgasm of rock and roll, but then we did that. 
[02:17:00]  Stuart and Sting and driving go-karts and Bob Kelly.  And Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  Breaking his leg.  So we did that thinking, same thing, police reunion.  This is our end.  We'll kind of like help him out with a project that is going to be a tough sell.  And then we did the Andy Summers, all within a week, week and a half.  So obviously something was up, and Andy Summers was plugging some awful fucking book.  The book is called One Train Later, and it was about if he had a... 
[02:17:30]  So you listen to all that boring shit, hoping that they would...  Do the right thing.  Hoping for the...  Yeah.  Quid pro quo.  These guys, the way it works, these guys lost our number faster than anybody, man.  Ever has lost our number.  No different than the intern who brought me a cup of coffee just now, hoping that I would  sotomize him.  Oh, right.  Really?  Right.  Nothing.  You get nothing.  Yeah.  So I'll go through with it, though. 
[02:18:00]  I'm no Sting.  No, you're not.  You're a mouth fucker to the end.  That's why we love you.  That's a throat clogger.  Let me say.  This happens...  But let's just say...  This happens to us all the time.  I figured...  Sorry.  I was just going to say that...  I got a theory on this.  Not a theory, but an observation.  Let's just say he's a mouth fucker.  Doug?  Yeah.  Yes.  And I just want to know, what would that sound like if, let's say, he grabbed a girl and  just fucked her mouth, Jim?  Well, the thing that Stanhope was legendary for doing is, and he don't want any fuck you 
[02:18:30]  from...  This is what it sounds like when I cum.  Give me a cigarette.  Well, he'll pinch the nose, and then he grabs the back of the head.  So she's straining.  That's when the cheeks puff out like she's playing the fucking Dizzy Gillespie.  That's when you get the old nose pinch and the cheeks pull it out, because the cock is 
[02:19:00]  at the back of the throat, and air cannot leave the nose.  The nose has been clogged.  It's fantastic.  Air has been told to go back.  Just to finish up the whole police thing and observation, when we get a huge star, we're  like, what?  He actually agreed to call our show or come in?  Nine out of ten times, the project he's promoting sucks.  It's dog shit.  It's so bad that they want to try to promote it everywhere possible. 
[02:19:30]  That's the observation I finally figured out.  Hence why the police came on as individuals, because they were plugging crappy projects.  Well, Stuart had to...  I mean, he talked a little bit about playing the drums and the...  Yeah.  I love that.  I love that.  Look at Jimmy's head, it's completely down on the microphone, isn't it?  Like, the microphone's a pillow.  But you know what it is, though?  It's like, we've not only been talking to those two, but then we go and we watch Sting,  and we're like, all right, we'll watch the guy. 
[02:20:00]  I mean, he's trying a new project, and it was interesting, because he was talking about  like, the lewd.  The fucking lute.  You fucking snore-fest threesome.  You want to see Sting, and you don't want to see him play the fucking lute.  I wouldn't want to see Sting.  You want to hear the lute?  What the hell is that?  This is a hit song from Sting and his lute.  There have been instruments invented since the lute.  The songs of John Dowling.  Oh, John Dowling was a cunt.  Oh, is that it?  How do you remember the name?  Because he said it, John Dowling, when he was 25 years old. 
[02:20:30]  These are the songs of John Dowling.  I bet you he's not breaking out his lute during this police reunion tour, because he knows  that it's the way of this shit.  That ain't where the money is.  And he's reading little bits of John Dowling's writings, and they're fucking awful.  This 16th century dullard.  How would you know?  In the middle of it, you were...  I couldn't catch it.  I'm in, John Dowling.  Like me when he's singing Roxanne.  Fucking shut up.  He would read the writings of John Dowling. 
[02:21:00]  What were they about?  Who knows?  We slept through them.  Love.  And the era.  Oh, God.  Oh, what a fucking...  Where did you lose your...  And that fucking Gerard Depardieu fucking fat man, he had playing the lute with him.  Dude.  He looked like Gerard Depardieu, and I hope he's dead as I speak.  I hope that guy was killed drunk driving.  Because if you were expecting Stink to do all the heavy lute playing, who knew that there 
[02:21:30]  was actually...  You could get much better with the stupid lute.  You had to get a session loudest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  And dude, the guy...  My favorite moment in the whole fucking thing, the lute...  Is doing a lute solo, and it sounded like it was over.  So everyone starts applauding.  Stupid us.  Because it was like six, seven seconds of dead air.  Like, just silence.  So we're like...  All right, I guess it's over.  So everyone starts applauding.  He dramatically lifts his hand up in the air, like...  Like the trumpet girl.  Oh, yeah, wait.  No, he's like, wait!  What are you doing?  Done yet? 
[02:22:00]  And then goes back into playing the lute.  Don't you know this song?  It's from 1413.  Right.  How can anyone not remember?  How dare you wreck the works of John Dowling?  I actually...  And now a hit from John Dowling.  Yeah, where are they?  This one comes out during the bubonic plague.  We come up with excuses to bring up the lute and Sting.  We can't get enough of him, John Dowling, the lute, the fucking, the lutist session player.  I tapped my feet more to the luting during Katrina. 
[02:22:30]  During this fucking shithead and that fat Gerard Depardieu fucking pederast.  Me and Jimmy were cracking...  Me and Jimmy were trying to make each other laugh to the point where we would wreck the whole performance.  We're like, the lines that were going back and forth between Jimmy and I, like, holy shit.  Now, was this in studio or you went to...  No, it was a big performance.  It was at the Jazz Center where all the greats play.  And all these phonies, including ourselves.  Of course. 
[02:23:00]  You guys were phonies.  I've never wanted to meet Patrice more than my life.  See, that's the honesty of this show.  At least we'll admit that we were as phony as everyone else in the place.  Because everyone's, like, politely applauding after every song.  They didn't even know what the fuck they heard.  Patrice would have just wanted to talk about it the next day.  Patrice would have looked puzzled for a second and then just unloaded.  He would have went, ah!  He would have done one of those.  Why aren't you playing Roxanne?  I said, what are you doing?  Loot! 
[02:23:30]  Oh, is this it?  Here it is.  This is the songs of John Dowling.  Listen for the hook.  To feed you delight  To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die  That's to die?  Who says to die?  Hey, you guys make fun, but fuck, that's good loot.  Yes.  Yeah.  He's kicking ass.  That's good loot right there. 
[02:24:00]  If you were going to propose to a fair maiden.  Yeah, this is the Renaissance festival music.  What the fuck?  You should be eating one of those big turkey legs and watching fake jousting.  Right.  All right, let's...  We gotta...  Yeah, keep going.  We gotta get to the hook again.  His voice sounds great, though.  You gotta give him credit.  The voice...  You can't hide a bad voice.  His voice sounds amazing.  But listen to how he says to die.  To dorm my sight.  I weep.  I fage.  I die.  What a deadly pain.  And it'll squeeze a heart. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, there you go.  That's what we get.  Sting and loot.  Instead of like Roxanne.  Can't you do Don't Stand So Close To Me?  He should have said that to the lootist.  He attempted to do some...  He did two police songs.  Do we have those?  He did Roxanne, which was very good.  But we didn't know until it was half over.  Not Roxanne.  Message in a bottle.  Message in a bottle.  We didn't know until it was half over.  And that message is put the fucking loot down and pick up the guitar.  Listen to the message in the bottle.  And I think if this is the one, I'm not sure.  Thank you. 
[02:25:00]  Thank you.  Like right now, no one knows what he's playing, right?  Yeah.  And listen to how long it takes.  And then the audience goes, oh my God, message in a bottle.  We got to start applauding.  Watch.  You have no fucking idea, right?  No, the king is passing judgment on the jester right now.  Right.  They're all picking airplane bottles of J&B out of their purses and just cough them down. 
[02:25:30]  He's very gentle.  Wasn't this playing in my headphones when I fell asleep?  Just to cast away.  Now they know.  Now they know.  Oh, I know what this song is.  All right.  Enough of that.  I like that version, though, because Sting, that fucker, his voice sounded amazing.  He's got a great voice, but he's also got a great attitude.  They're saying he sounds amazing on the tour.  They sound just like the albums, you know?  Yeah.  But what a pompous ass. 
[02:26:00]  We were talking about when he would do that or fucking Neil Young.  I hope he went to see Neil Young.  And you go to see Neil Young, you want to see him do his fucking hits.  If you want to do some kind of a self-appreciation evening, do it in your fucking living room.  Or write on the ticket.  You're not going to hear anything you know.  Yeah, let everyone know what they're not getting, which is the shit that they've all heard on the radio and stuff.  And Neil Young got out there and just did.  It's one of my favorite concert stories ever.  A bunch of shit. 
[02:26:30]  I treated my brother.  Treat us out.  Me and my brothers growing up, we were big Neil Young fans, you know?  Powderfinger, all that fun stuff.  Welfare Mothers.  I mean, and I go a little deeper than the average Neil Young fan.  I do.  So we go to the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden.  We sit there.  And the first three or four songs, completely unrecognizable.  But everyone was like, oh, Neil Young, man.  Awesome.  It's got to be getting some good stuff.  And then you can feel the whole crowd changing.  Like, what the fuck is he?  What the? 
[02:27:00]  And everyone starts looking around like, do you know this song?  And everyone's like, no, I don't know.  Self-indulgent douche.  You're looking around like, and then there's, of course, one dude somewhere like, oh, all right.  But for the most part, the crowd is like clueless.  Was he doing Mr. Roboto?  Right.  Oh, that's a good one.  And there's a guy sitting behind us who's got to be like just the uber Neil Young fan.  And his excitement, like, I can't believe we're here.  We drove from Jersey.  Look at our seats, you know.  And he's turning and turning.  And all of a sudden, you start hearing him talking under his belt.  What the fuck is going on? 
[02:27:30]  We spent $75 a ticket.  Where's the fucking Neil Young songs?  What the fuck?  And then another one.  You can hear him like, oh, another one.  I don't know.  Right.  Finally, the guy is completely quiet.  He stands up and he goes, hey, Neil, how about one for us?  The place went fucking, like, just lost it laughing and clapping.  Like, yeah, this is what we're all thinking.  What are you doing?  He's up there appreciating himself.  How about one for us?  Oh, I hate that.  If you can find a concert that's quiet enough that you can, yes. 
[02:28:00]  Right.  That you can yell something out like that and get a laugh?  There's a problem.  Oh, man, it made my night.  And then he ended up playing, I couldn't even tell you which two you knew.  So he finally, like, turned on and gave us, like, a card of gold or something.  And Doug raised a good point about Mr. Roboto.  I like it at the end where they're just kind of like, uh, domo.  Domo.  That's my favorite part.  Mr. Roboto.  Domo, domo. 
[02:28:30]  Domo, domo.  Somebody bleeped out the H, which is what you should be saying for that fucking song.  Home, homo, homo, homo, homo, homo, homo.  Dome, homo, homo, homo, homo, homo, homo, homo, homo.  Mr. Roboto.  As somebody spits, like, backwash snot and saliva into your pubes.  The whole nose pitch.  The whole Dennis DeYoung's nose.  Yes, Mr. Roboto.  Oh, what an awful time.  And they would act it out on stage or something? 
[02:29:00]  Yes, it was a huge thing.  And trust his robots, Jimmy.  Fucking assholes.  I am.  I love.  So affected.  They had to change the name of the band to Stinks.  I got a secret.  Yes.  Not anymore.  Please don't tell mother.  Right.  Do you have a secret?  You're the last to know.  Can we turn this up?  Touch me under where my bathing suit covers.  Secret, secret.  Modern man.  Modern man.  Fucking Tommy Shaw.  One of the greatest guitar players ever. 
[02:29:30]  How to play this shit.  No, you don't.  And Tommy Shaw was annoying, too, though.  It was during Renegade.  He was fucking all peppy.  Oh, he certainly was.  He loved the Renegade.  With his lisp.  Yeah, it was a bad lisp, too.  Yeah.  When he sings that one song.  I'm sitting on his bar, talking like a damn fool.  Got the 12 o'clock news blues.  So you got the Red Hot Chili Peppers guy.  Yeah, he's got a little bit of a lisp, too.  He's got a bad one, yeah.  Anthony Kiedis.  Yeah.  Hey, I got to beat myself up.  This guy's absolutely right. 
[02:30:00]  Opie, when you treat someone to a concert, you don't go on the air and tell everyone.  You're absolutely right, instant feedbacker with no name.  Treat yourself.  Mike in Columbus.  What's up, Mike?  What's going on, guys?  How you doing today?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Kabal this summer, we went to Styx, REO, and Def Leppard here in Columbus.  Styx was badass.  REO comes on, plays two songs, and then he gets on there and says, hey, we're going to 
[02:30:30]  play all kinds of new stuff now.  The whole place went, and everybody sat down.  It was fantastic.  No one goes to see REO Speedwagon.  First of all, no one should go see REO Speedwagon.  That's a given.  That's the first mistake you made, Mike, by going to see these bands.  No one should go.  At one point, it's your critique.  No one's going for new shit.  Believe me.  I would still see Def Leppard.  I've seen Def Leppard after they were through their prime already, and it sounded great.  I think they're terrible, and I wish I liked them, because they have so many hits. 
[02:31:00]  I like bringing on the heartache.  It's the only Def.  Dude, you don't like pour some sugar on me?  Hysteria is one of the greatest freaking rock albums ever made.  It's like party rock, man.  I don't like, because it's all like big fucking choruses.  Yeah.  I don't like that style.  No?  Like.  Guys, you got to remember where we're at.  This guitar is.  It's, you know, doesn't hold up to the test of time, but.  Come on.  This song I like.  We're in Ohio is no excuse. 
[02:31:30]  Go to the car show, pick one, and fucking leave.  You got it.  This is.  I'll pick you up.  Have a good week.  This isn't off Hysteria, by the way.  Are you just playing for Jimmy?  This is what I like, yeah.  All right.  Play what I don't like.  By the way, like, to these bands that think that we want to hear their new shit, first  of all, we don't, obviously.  What they should do is, if they think they got a song that's really good, let radio have  it for about 10 years, and then finally bring it to your stupid concerts.  Yeah.  See how, see how the people like it. 
[02:32:00]  If you're a classic rock band, does radio even work like that anymore?  No.  Can you do that?  Nope.  No.  Put it on the internet.  That's why these bands are as big as they are, because the radio was just stupid for  30, 40 years.  Bunch of faggots who won't play new songs.  They got to do research.  You look at the playlist.  Fucking uncreative faggots.  That's what you get.  Buh-bye.  Buh-bye.  Yes, but we didn't play last season.  Let's only play War Pigs. 
[02:32:30]  Jesus, Jimmy.  Fucking cocksuckers.  Most stations don't even play War Pigs.  They give you crazy train.  That's it.  Nobody is saying they play Starry to Heaven.  I think the people won't like that.  Take a real risk.  Fucking assholes.  Take a real risk here.  I think what radio did to Led Zeppelin is the biggest thing ever.  I know you would argue Black Sabbath, but fucking Zeppelin has, I mean, they pretty  much didn't put out a bad song until they came out with Coda, and half that shit never  made the radio. 
[02:33:00]  Not a Zeppelin fan.  I'm not a music fan.  Yeah.  I don't like music.  Yeah, Doug's just like, fuck all these people.  Why aren't you a Zeppelin fan?  I just was never into Zeppelin.  I was more a Who guy.  Yeah, I like the Who, too.  More Who than Zeppelin.  Zeppelin was just too fake sounding.  They sold sex.  Yeah.  Sex appeal.  Bob's playing a lot of sex appeal.  Yeah, squeeze my lemon.  With this big fucking cock in his pants out on stage.  How do you not look at that thing?  Yeah, man.  It's flowing blonde hair.  Exactly.  Like a tranny.  Squeeze my lemon.  You didn't know how to tuck. 
[02:33:30]  Squeeze my lemon until the juice runs down my leg.  Come on.  Yeah, no shit.  Hey, what is he talking about there?  Ah, let's see how to...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Thanks for picking a Zeppelin song that sucks, by the way.  Prove him, my point.  He rock badly.  Just sucks.  He rock means well, but it isn't only his look good songs.  Oh, oh, oh.  He rock eats well.  That's about it.  Let's say hi to Keith in D.C.  Keith. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, Opie.  How's it going?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  I just had to call because you said Hysteria was one of the greatest rock albums.  You were such a girl, okay?  Because that is like a girl rock album.  That's the album you play when you're out trying to get laid.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  When did that album come out?  What year did that come out?  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  87.  87.  88, maybe?  Let's say 87, 88.  Keith, what would you consider 87, 88 like to be a really good song or band back then? 
[02:34:30]  Back then, I was listening to probably That Would Have Been So Far, So Good, So What by Megadad.  I was more into the thrash metal stuff.  All right.  See, thrash metal was an acquired fucking taste back then for sure.  Everyone wasn't into it.  For regular rock dudes, you didn't have a lot to pick from in 87.  I mean, especially the fucking thrash rock guys were not into anything that ended up  on the radio.  You guys were not into one fucking song that was radio friendly. 
[02:35:00]  Guns N' Roses had what, 87, 86?  No.  Later than that, I think.  Fucking sucked.  Fucking song.  I remember the first time I heard Welcome to the Jungle.  It had to be 86 was Welcome to the Jungle, right?  I thought it was closer to 90.  Am I wrong?  That fucking record was amazing.  Yeah, later 80s, I think.  Okay.  Yeah, I should have picked Appetite for Destruction.  You're right.  Yeah, that's one of the best ever.  But, Keith, my point is simple.  Like, in the mid to late 80s, we didn't have a lot to choose from. 
[02:35:30]  You had to go, like, old school, like The Who or Zeppelin or Sabbath.  There weren't a lot of great new bands coming out.  Material Girl.  Madonna.  Yeah, I was listening to Zeppelin and all that.  I mean, you had Guns N' Roses.  The old brothers and all were into when they were kids.  Seriously.  All right, really fast.  Who else came out around 87?  Guns N' Roses.  Metallica was still on the ground.  You know, Master of Puppets.  No, Metallica was doing well.  No, they weren't.  I saw them in 86.  Dude, but you were ahead of the curve. 
[02:36:00]  I'm telling you.  Metallica.  Dude, 80 fucking four.  No, I saw them in 86 opening for Ozzy.  But I'm just saying, Metallica didn't get Airplay until they came out with the Black Album.  And I was in freaking Buffalo.  So that was like, no, one was.  One, one, one Airplay.  One Guns N' Roses.  Yeah.  It's not a lot, man.  Dude, it was all over MTV.  It was all over.  Their videos were all over MTV.  One?  One was the one.  Remember that fucking creepy one?  Yeah.  Johnny got his gun.  Yeah, yeah.  That was fucking scary.  Oh, don't forget Whitesnake.  Wasn't Whitesnake 87? 
[02:36:30]  Whitesnake, yeah.  Okay.  A lot of hair bands and shit.  I was completely into Whitesnake.  Were you?  Yeah.  I mean.  Because I saw them with Motley Crue in 87.  That was a good score.  Yeah, that's what you had.  A lot of those bands.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  But like.  All right.  As far as.  But that was kind of.  And if you go earlier 80s, you had nothing but.  Like, believe me.  There were guys that thought Journey was a fucking cool rock band to listen to.  Yeah, I used to listen to Journey.  Fucking Journey. 
[02:37:00]  And now you listen and go, Journey?  Early 80s.  I was listening to that.  Everybody.  In the 80s, they tried to like, retire the guitar, which was a sin.  Yeah.  No one was playing the guitar in the early 80s.  And synthesized drums.  Right.  That was going to be the wave of the future.  The little pads.  Remember Sugar Hill Gang?  They thought rap was going to be popular.  Yeah.  Those dummies.  All right, Keith.  I actually did a TV show with you.  The big surprise guest was Wonder Mike.  Geez.  Wonder Mike?  Yeah, look at that. 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  Keith, I suck.  You're great.  Oh, you told me about that that time.  You don't have that picture on your MySpace.  That was that pilot that you did with the, oh, no, that was Mikey.  All right, shut up.  Well, there's my help.  No need.  You're right.  I don't care.  I'll ring it anyway.  And someone's calling me queer because I liked Cinderella.  Fast Freddy.  No.  I'm not a fan of Cinderella.  The band or the story.  When she gets that, goes to the ball.  She didn't have a very good life.  It worked out nicely. 
[02:38:00]  Glass slipper.  I think Cinderella was one of those bands that got fucked by grunge.  They were a pretty cool, bluesy band.  They were mixed in with too many other bands that were a little better at it than they were.  If you were listening to Cinderella, by that point, what was wrong with the Motley Crue?  But Cinderella got swept out when fucking Nirvana hit.  Cinderella was like, I hated that fucking singer too.  Tommy, was it Tom's key for something?  It always looked like he wanted to fucking give a blowjob to one of the bandmates. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, because they all had to look like that.  They all were wearing the makeup and teasing their hair and shit.  Not a Cinderella fan.  Sounds like Wasp.  Like Blacky Lawless.  It was good.  They had one good song.  Big saw blade on his cock.  What was his one good song by Wasp?  Oh, fuck.  I don't know.  I don't know Wasp.  What a corny name.  Yeah.  Blacky Lawless.  I'm Blacky Lawless.  I'm so bad that I have a fucking table saw blade embedded in my cock. 
[02:39:00]  Are the feds after you, Blacky?  Because he's lawless.  He certainly is.  He don't pay attention to the rules.  Loose cannon.  Loose cannon.  You're right.  But they had one big song.  I don't expect Eric to find it.  He'll probably find the acoustic version.  I think they did in 596.  Steve's in there helping.  I remember.  Let me slip in Foundry's Pendulum while I'm at it. 
[02:39:30]  What was the...  Watermark, watermark, watermark.  People are saying, what about Billy Squire?  Billy Squire was huge at one point.  And that was what you listened to.  To that video where he's dancing like a 14-year-old girl.  Yeah.  That was really bad.  But Stroke Me and that shit.  That was...  Dude, let me make this perfectly clear.  But Billy Squire came in when I was doing radio in Buffalo.  Yeah.  And I have no idea.  No fucking idea. 
[02:40:00]  This is my opinion.  I don't want to be sued.  Blah, blah, blah.  Wow.  Did he seem like he was the gayest guy alive.  Did he?  Holy shit.  Wow.  Interesting.  You can't get sued for that.  I have no fucking...  That was a precedent.  I went to the Supreme Court and they say, well, you can't sue someone for saying you're  gay because there's nothing wrong with being gay.  There's no slander there.  Why is it a slam?  There was...  Yeah, I went to court.  It was...  I don't know if it was a Supreme Court or it was a state Supreme Court somewhere.  Yeah. 
[02:40:30]  That was a...  Yeah, a couple of years ago.  There was so...  And you're gay.  I only know I got sued for defamation once.  So I watch all these...  You can't get sued.  Now, just for talking shit about some guy on my website.  But I said something that was like criminal.  Like I called him a crackhead or something.  Shit.  Yeah, I think through the case, I didn't lose.  Like it didn't even get to court.  It got dismissed.  Yeah.  But I got to pay a fucking lawyer to...  No shit.  Yeah, well...  So yeah, I made note of that.  Next time, call him a fag. 
[02:41:00]  And I already get shot down in court.  I have no clue.  But man, when he came in, I'm like, this is the same Billy Squire with all those MTV  videos?  Holy shit.  What is this about?  Who was he fooling?  Yeah, well...  A lot of people, if you watch the videos.  That one video where he's dancing like a girl.  Yeah, he really looked bad.  All right, good point.  And that evidently killed his career.  I saw it on some VH1 thing where they said, yeah, rock me tonight.  You know that?  Yeah, he's dancing like a girl.  Yeah.  Priest was huge. 
[02:41:30]  Judas Priest.  Yes, they were.  That was big in the 80s.  They were big in the 70s too, though.  Were they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Like, you got another thing coming, which off...  I want to say Screaming for Vengeance was the album name.  With an electric eye and stuff.  I think that was very early.  Screaming for cock?  Was that what it was off of?  No, his asshole was screaming for vengeance.  Like, could you get the guy back who fucking opened me this big...  And fucking didn't close me.  I'm gaping.  Prolapse me.  I'll prolapse you, sir.  Screaming for stitches. 
[02:42:00]  Breaking the law in certain southern states.  Yes, you were.  Who's this?  This is Billy Squire.  Yeah, this is Billy Squire doing his dance.  I guess now it's pretty obvious if you look at this whole video.  Oh, what a fucking family.  What is that?  Look at the fucking balls he's got going on.  I know, you gotta respect that.  Wow, quite the set of balls on him.  He came back out on one of these tours with...  Oh, my God.  What's he doing?  Maybe it was obvious.  Freddie Mercury was laughing at him. 
[02:42:30]  Is he trying to be cool?  He looks gay.  Maybe I didn't know what to look for back then.  I was just a kid when this shit came out.  He's trying to get the chicks.  Look at this.  Right?  Yes.  And by chicks, I mean guys.  What a cock, though.  I know.  He's all ball bag, I think.  He sure is.  He's got nothing but ball bag.  Look at that ridiculous move.  What a cock sucker he looks like.  Wait, where's the one where he does the...  Yeah, that's a video.  This is like concert footage.  The video that...  That's...  All right, we'll try to find it. 
[02:43:00]  Find the hot one.  Find the hot one.  Find the hot one.  Find one that's yankable.  Exactly.  That's something I could jack to.  I used to jerk off to Crimson and Clover by Joan Jett.  That video, because it showed her ass.  Really?  Yeah, we jerked off.  Here we go.  This is so unsexy.  This is the one.  Her ass is the fucking man.  All right, here's Billy Squire.  Sweet.  Yeah, he's in bed.  The satin sheets.  The blood on the satin sheets from his ruptured spinter.  There's a horse head. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You put on those PJs.  What is he doing?  He's getting all dressed.  What a fruit.  Hey, your sleeves are ripped.  Hey, what happened to that sleeve?  It's not all the way ripped off.  What is he doing?  Oh, my God.  Fucking good call.  Doug's down.  Oh, Doug.  He is doing the gayest little dance.  Oh, my God.  Can you explain what he just did? 
[02:44:00]  I can't even explain this.  He's snapping his fingers and swinging them from side to side.  What he did was the equivalent picture sucking a dick, but you're not sucking a dick, you're  snapping.  Everything you're doing while you're sucking a dick.  Wow.  Two snaps up.  Wait, you're saying this?  In living color.  You're saying this is the video that fucked up his career?  Yes.  Because then people were kind of onto him.  Oh, my God.  He's crawling.  Now he's crawling on the floor.  Like everyone realizes he's a dick.  Crawl for dick.  Now he's just laying on the floor, writhing around, looking for a big hairy cock. 
[02:44:30]  What the fuck is that?  Give me the gayest video that he didn't know was gay.  He's rolling around.  I think this is where everyone couldn't.  I remember when I was like 12, I didn't know the village people were gay.  I didn't either.  Yeah.  But then you figure it out.  This is where everyone figured it out.  Look at this dance.  He looks like fucking, what's the name, from Flashdance.  Yeah.  He's doing like.  Yeah, he's doing the Flashdance dance.  He's like, he's like dancing on air. 
[02:45:00]  Now he's got a pink fucking.  He goes through a lot of shirts because he's tearing them off of himself.  He's got a pink girl shirt on right now.  He's, I can't describe the dance he's doing.  He's like snapping left and right and squishing his hips.  Yeah.  Take me on your ass.  God, what a faggot.  It's like what a wham would do during one of their little dances.  Wow.  Yeah, but see, I don't know.  I was either like clueless or too young to know that this is a pretty gay thing going on right now. 
[02:45:30]  This is the video that caused AIDS in 1983.  It came right off of this video.  The government released it.  They said, we have to get rid of these people.  This is unacceptable.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  She looked gay.  Wow.  I've, I've never, I defy you to find a gayer video.  Find a gayer video by a guy that most people thought was straight, I guess. 
[02:46:00]  I, I defy you to find a gayer video.  Who the fuck watched this?  Don't make us get the Frankie Goes to Hollywood videos.  Not as gay as that.  Dude, the guy is, is gay, but that, that, that, not as gay.  This is the gayest video.  He's prancing in a pink shirt and rolling around in a silk bed and on the floor.  He's like, he's running around.  He's all but skipping.  He's running around like if Steven Tyler was gay. 
[02:46:30]  He's trying to do like Steven Tyler type moves, but it just comes across really.  Now he's all exhausted.  He's curling his lip like Billy Squire.  I mean, like Billy Idol.  Billy Idol.  Yeah, he's doing the snarl.  Who thinks this is cool?  Did he really watch, they have to watch this in post and go, good.  And there you go.  No, no, go closer on that one where I spin.  Oh, too late to pick up the guitar.  Put it up his ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you going to play on the elevator?  You're not going to be cool.  Oh, now he's with his band rocking out, man. 
[02:47:00]  God, what a tool.  Oh, what the hell were people thinking?  Oh, he's wearing the little tank, the pink tank top with a white sleeveless t-shirt under it.  So was that supposed to mean that he left his bedroom, walked back into the closet, and  now he's with his band?  Back in the closet.  He came out of the closet for a second.  Oh, Mike.  The 80s were awful.  There's a guy with the fucking, the brim hat like Hannibal Lecter at the end of fucking  Silence of the Lambs.  Yeah, playing the drums.  How terrible.  Wow, that was pretty bad.  And I think that was really bad. 
[02:47:30]  Great find.  And I think the gay, back in a lot of these videos from the 80s, you blended in because  everyone else was wearing that weird shit that if you were gay, you blended right in.  Everyone kind of looked the gay.  Right.  The gay gets kind of lost.  Yeah, so you kind of thought, wow, they were just kind of being cool.  Right.  Because a lot of these guys in these bands, especially the hair bands, very feminine,  feminine moves and look, and that was supposed to be cool.  There really hasn't been a look for the last 20 years. 
[02:48:00]  There's no look.  Yeah, Grunge had a look.  I can't believe in 2000, I had a normal haircut and wore that t-shirt.  Grunge had a look in the 90s.  Like, that was a definite look.  Fucking the stupid hunting hat with the ear things on him.  All right, but it was still, mostly it's a flannel shirt.  Yeah, flannel.  Torn jeans.  Grubby and torn jeans.  But that was kind of a look.  Now, it's fucking like emo shit.  You got to have straight hair that's combed over one eye. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  But that's the extreme.  But walking down the street, nobody, I don't know.  Hey, someone is saying, check out the Pet Shop Boys video where the guy is nude jumping  on a trampoline.  All right, that could be gay.  What's the name of the song, though?  The Pet Shop Boys.  What's the name of the fucking song?  Faggot?  I don't know what could possibly...  All right, let's get into Joe in Albany.  Joe?  Yeah, I went to see Billy Squire back in like the late 80s, and I was always a big fan.  I went to see him, and I just got this vibe, like, that people were grabbing my ass. 
[02:49:00]  Nervously, everybody was talking with a lisp, and it was like just the weirdest.  Did a security guy with that?  I threw away all my Billy Squire albums.  Did a security guy with a headset come up and tap you on the shoulder and go, Mr. Squire  would like the pleasure of your company backstage after the show?  No, but the same concert.  The keyboardist, his longtime keyboardist, I thought it was a girl at first.  What, until it squealed?  It's very guttural. 
[02:49:30]  Until I saw the cock.  See, this brings up something that we could discuss, and maybe I'm off here, but he hate  me, he writes from New Jersey.  Couldn't figure out that Squire was gay.  Remember, this is the same guy that put out The Stroke, where there were a bunch of guys  chanting stroke.  Stroke me, stroke me.  But there's...  Stroke men, stroke men.  You kind of thought he was talking to, like, the girls.  Which is actually gayer.  Yeah, stroke men, not stroke me, the actual lyric.  But this could bring up a good conversation.  Some of the stuff we watched on TV and stuff, growing up, you had no clue. 
[02:50:00]  No.  That there was a gay character or something.  You just thought it was...  Like, Halford was supposed to be a badass.  You'd watch, like, the Priest videos and be like, wow, he's a badass.  He's all in leather.  He's wearing the leather biker stuff.  And the little hat, like, the Village People guy wore.  But then you look later on and go, oh, goddamn, was that obvious?  But the point I'm making is, like, the Billy Squire video, a lot of us saw that. 
[02:50:30]  And we just didn't have enough knowledge to realize, holy shit, that is really gay.  Yeah.  And then you get older and you look back at some of this stuff you used to watch or something  and go, wow, I had no idea.  Like, did you know Paul Lynn was gay when he was doing, like, Bewitched?  Yeah, yeah.  See, I had no idea.  No, I'm kidding.  I didn't.  Yeah, five years old.  He was just a funny guy.  But that's what I'm saying.  You just thought they were funny guys?  He was the funny uncle guy that used to, like, come into your room at night.  But again, you go back to the whole Liberace thing where housewives wouldn't believe it. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, they loved Liberace.  Yeah, they wouldn't tolerate anyone saying he was gay.  And there he is pulling a candelabra, putting it on his piano and playing.  And talking like that.  And people are just like, oh, he's great, Liberace.  Rock Hudson was, like, the manliest guy.  But, all right, there's a good example.  You go and watch some of his old movies or old TV shows.  Would it be very obvious now?  Like, holy shit, of course he was.  Rock Hudson kind of covered it up pretty well.  But you could see kind of occasionally when he'd look at John Shuck's ass in Macmillan and Wife. 
[02:51:30]  John Shuck.  Remember Macmillan and Beard?  Macmillan and Beard.  By the way, everyone's coming in with Right Said Fred, I'm Too Sexy, gayest video ever.  Yeah, but that was covert, like, or overtly gay.  Yeah, okay.  That was like, you knew it was gay the second you saw it.  It wasn't like...  What about Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go?  Is that gayer than the Billy Squire one we just saw? 
[02:52:00]  No, I don't know.  She's pretty gay, but...  Well, that's pretty bad, too.  A lot of people are pointing out this one.  The Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Dancing in the Street.  Oh, horrid.  Horrid with the way they're, like, almost making out with each other.  And there was a rumor that they had suck each other's necks.  Bad dancing and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Yeah, this is really bad.  Talk about some gay dancing. 
[02:52:30]  The Mick is really tearing it up.  Almost...  Calling out...  Ah, thank you!  And then David Bowie has never been really that masculine.  Oh, my God!  What does he do?  He's traipsing!  He's traipsing!  Oh, he's tough.  David Bowie fucking stinks.  He has one good song.  Oh, I love Bowie.  And then they're, like, right...  Yeah.  They're in each other's faces, like, prancing and... 
[02:53:00]  Modern love singing to each other.  Just imagine you and your pal doing that.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  That's when you...  Oh!  Look at them.  They're going to kiss.  Come on.  Come on now.  What the fuck is that?  They're...  They got their...  Foreheads touching.  Oh, my God.  And Mick has a mullet. 
[02:53:30]  That was awful.  He still has that hair.  I bet they both smell chlorine as they're singing to each other like that.  Exactly.  They both have buddy booth breaths.  Oh, by the way, people are pointing out the obvious.  We all watched Brady Bunch growing up.  Now, when you watch the old episodes of Brady Bunch, is it obvious that Mr. Brady's gay?  Not at all.  That's what I'm getting at.  But some of this stuff you do look at, you're like, fuck, wow, of course.  There's one moment, though, where every house he designed looked like a cock. 
[02:54:00]  Why do they all have silo rooms?  Oh, I see.  That's all he designs is silos.  Where the grain gets shot out the top.  It's stored in two huge bulbous little things at the base of the...  Fuck you.  I was trying to figure out what the hell it was.  That's right.  The ladder's like a big vein going around.  You know balls.  Bulbous.  Bulbous things that would...  All right.  We'll take a break.  Doug Stanhope on MySpace for all his dates.  He's playing New England. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, yeah.  For the next week.  Worcester, Mass Saturday.  I'll just push that one.  But everywhere else.  All right.  Cool.  When we get back, we got the Hall of Fame of the 8-Track Porn thus far.  Oh.  We got the great lines from that one.  We should play that for Doug, though.  You fucking god.  Oh, we got Dr. Adam Cox calling in today.  Dr. Cox is calling in today?  Dr. Adam Cox.  And what is his specialty?  Yeah, Sam.  What's his specialty?  Understanding and fostering executive control. 
[02:55:00]  Fair enough.  All right.  All right.  So, we want our audience to participate in this interview.  And, guys, we know how you guys can be.  So, we want serious questions only.  Right.  You know, don't goof around.  Serious questions only.  The book's called No Mind Left Behind.  What does that mean?  Understanding and fostering executive control.  The eight essential brain skills.  Every child needs to thrive.  Hmm. 
[02:55:30]  Okay.  Needs to thrive.  That's good.  Oh, here's a picture of him.  Mm-hmm.  Again, serious questions only, people.  Don't be goofing around.  Why the richest kids don't get ADHD.  Mm.  ADHD.  Wow, this book looks really good.  Fucking slap across the face.  That's what my old man would say. 
[02:56:00]  Hey.  A smack across the face will cure that.  I'll get your attention, you little fuck.  Oh, boy.  Hang the strap on the doorknob at night.  Oh, Anthony and Joe, they're talking a little too much.  I'm trying to watch Ronan Martin's laughing.  Anthony and Joe are in the room, and they're yapping.  They're talking too much.  Well, I'll go in with the belt, smack him a few times,  and then hang the belt on the doorknob so it swings  and the buckle kind of glistens in the light.  That's a hate crime. 
[02:56:30]  And then let me tell you something, though.  No ADHD.  There was an attention deficit at that point.  My attention was fully on that fucking belt  and the not wanting it to hit my ass again.  Well, you didn't have that much.  In those days, you didn't have that much trying to get your attention.  The fucking news with the 10-minute ticker  and fucking your iPod and your text messaging.  Do you think that's attention deficit?  Well, I'm just saying, there's so much bells and whistles in this world. 
[02:57:00]  It's like cool shit.  I call it cool shit.  I know, but you can't pay attention to any of it for long without...  Ah, then the father should take it away and smack the kid in the head.  All right.  What are you doing?  You know what my dad would do if he was here right now?  He'd smell bad because he's been dead for 10 years.  That's right.  Uncomfortable.  And he'd throw something against the wall and little Anthony would get a tummy ache  and yell to mommy,  I have a stomach ache.  Please pay attention to me and my stomach ache 
[02:57:30]  so you would stop fighting.  But they wouldn't.  I would sit there with a tummy ache the whole night.  Fake tummy ache?  Fake tummy ache.  Yeah.  Because I just wanted to say that I had a tummy ache  so that way my mommy would have to take care of me  and they would stop fighting.  But did they stop fighting?  Selfish.  No.  The spaghetti hit the wall anyway.  Another thing is...  How many times meatloaf ones too?  Kids aren't paying attention to shit that they don't want to fucking...  Like history...  You know, half the shit they're learning in school.  Of course they're not paying attention.  Yes, because it's fucking boring and pointless to learn. 
[02:58:00]  Teach them fun, exciting stuff.  World War II.  Yeah, just the same way beating them with a belt.  You know, entertain the fucking kids.  Give them something interesting and maybe they'll pay attention.  Hey, I had a lot of good times going out to the bar.  I don't give a fuck about 1492.  Columbus sailed the ocean blue.  See?  Yes.  I remember the pledge of allegiance and all this pointlessness.  Oh, my kid's not paying attention.  There must be something wrong with his brain.  No, maybe there's something right with his brain.  Maybe he's fucking smart and you're trying to dumb him down. 
[02:58:30]  Give him something.  Ooh, I like that.  Give him some lithium.  That'll slow him down a little bit.  So then I'll be with the rest of the class.  That's what I think when I give those psychotropic drugs to kids.  It's like this kid could probably be a genius.  Right.  If Benjamin Franklin went to public school right now, he was trying to harness energy from  the sky.  It's like a string.  God, the kid's going to kill himself.  Kid's all like pumped up. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  He's interested in lightning and shit.  He's fucked up.  Well, here you go.  Give him these.  Give him this.  Give him this.  That makes a great fucking sleeping.  That's a really good point.  What are you doing, Ben?  Inventing something?  Nah, I'm fucking tired.  I'm just going to sleep, man.  Ben, you were in buckled shoes and high stocking socks.  Are you a cock sucker?  No, Father.  I'm just going to fly a kite with a bow in my hair.  He was cruising.  He wasn't trying to discover electricity.  A bow in his...  That was the smoke signal for other faggots to show up. 
[02:59:30]  Wow.  Ben Franklin's flying his kite again.  And then he's like, holy shit, I invented electricity.  Exactly.  That was the...  I just wanted to suck a cock.  That was the equivalent of a Craigslist post glory hole open.  They'd see that kite and they'd come from miles around and get their dick sucked by bending  the stocking shoes.  A little reach under my paunch.  There's a little something for you.  That was a little tapping buckle shoe underneath the toilet stall.  Shiny buckle shoe and stocking feet.  Your two buckles clank together as the feet hit. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, look, the kite's up.  Get those balls ready.  Ben's sucking.  Get my stagecoach.  That Franklin boy is sucking again.  And then he fucking got zapped by lightning and the next thing you know, everything changes.  He's like, yeah, I meant to do that.  He was embarrassed.  And then he was in the public eye so he really couldn't cruise.  The police are like, are you here sucking cock again?  He's like, no, I was trying to discover something magic.  Electricity.  Wait till you see what this shit does.  Absolutely.  And Franklin loved cock. 
[03:00:30]  Worshipped it.  It's being boring.  Watch out, boys.  Bukkakying on his bifocals that he invented.  All the cum getting caught in that little crease between the two lenses.  What'll I do?  That's why that fucking, who is it, Magellan or whichever one of those guys found that telescope?  That's what it was.  He was trying to watch his neighbor jerking off behind the shrubs in 1612.  His fucking, the neighbor boy was retarded and had a big retarded boy's cock.  Galileo? 
[03:01:00]  Oh, was it Galileo?  Oh, yeah, Magellan was a fucking sailor looking for cock all over the world.  He wanted some more unclipped dick.  He wanted black dick.  He couldn't get it from where he was from.  That's right, Galileo.  His fucking neighbor would stroke his big retarded neighbor dick behind a fucking, a juniper berry bush.  And he couldn't get enough of that fucking kid.  The kid was 15 and he had curly pubes with a big retarded dick.  The boy was scared.  He would try to hammer his own penis off in the barn because it was so big he thought it was the devil's work. 
[03:01:30]  Galileo had to peek at it.  I don't get it.  Oh, fucking Jimmy.  Wow.  Hey, we got the gay video up on one of the flat screens.  Oh.  A skid veg, Greg.  Oh, come on.  Where'd this come from?  I came from Newcastle in the north of Harrison. 
[03:02:00]  What the fuck is this?  It's man-ass.  Coming out of the water.  They play this on MTV?  I don't think so.  What is this?  It's like pixelated.  It's a nude guy jumping on a trampoline for a Pet Shop Boys video.  Oh, Pet Shop Boys?  Are the Pet Shop Boys gay?  This is gay porn for 1952.  It's with a dog.  I hope the dog bit his dick off.  Or just grabbed his bag because he didn't know there was peanut butter on it by accident. 
[03:02:30]  He just jumped over the dog's snout.  Nude.  Oh, my God.  It's just nude men videos?  Is the guy just a nude?  Shaving his chest?  There's a chick in the tub, but...  I know.  She's laughing.  Why am I in this video?  Yeah.  What the fuck am I doing here?  Yeah.  What do you need me for?  She's laughing at the irony.  I don't get it.  All right.  Well, that's pretty... 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, that's pretty...  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Right.  That's what we were going to do about 20 minutes ago.  Yeah, yeah.  I couldn't help it.  We just got sidetracked.  I love your theory on...  I'm right.  Believe me.  I can prove it.  I'm going to go piss around.  I'm going to smoke and read up on Dr. Cox.  The devil's word.  Alexander Graham Bell, what do you think he was doing?  He just wanted to talk to guys who had bigger cocks all over the place.  And he got sick of yelling out the window and being stoned by his neighbors.  Who's got a big cock? 
[03:03:30]  And the rocks would come flying up in the window.  He'd invent the phone.  Exactly.  So he had to talk through a can with a string.  How big's your cock?  And the guy went, oh, nothing.  He's like, oh, perfect.  No one threw rocks at us this time.  Town crier for cock.  Paul Revere.  Please, the British are coming.  He meant that literally.  It wasn't a warning.  It was a call to all faggots to run out with their mouths open.  The British and their fucking two-gallon capacity ball bags are coming. 
[03:04:00]  Open up.  Open up.  I love that, you know, it's not good enough that they just come running out of their houses.  They come running out of their houses with their mouths open.  Right.  I'm going, we've got to get the British are coming.  They're wanting so much.  Yes.  That just the thought of them running out of their houses isn't good enough.  They're running out to get cocks.  No, not only are they running out to get cocks, they have their mouths open already.  Because they don't want to waste a second.  The British are coming.  And what was happening at that time is that you'd go, look at all that come. 
[03:04:30]  And while you said it, it was being spilled worthlessly in the dirt.  So they learned that if you ran out with your mouth open, you'd catch more of that fucking  big seed.  Hey, Jimmy, what do you think Ponce de Leon meant by the Fountain of Youth?  Will he ever win that war?  I don't, I kind of know who he was, but I'm not sure.  He discovered the, yeah.  I was just setting you up with a softball on Fountain of Youth.  Discovered the Fountain of Youth, apparently.  Okay, well, apparently that was, he was a, oh, Ponce de Leon, he was a babysitter. 
[03:05:00]  That's right.  The Fountain of Youth.  That's right.  I forgot the whole controversy with the Jenkins boy.  Yes.  The Jenkins boy.  The mother walked in and said, Ponce, why do you have your head in my boy's lap?  And he said, it makes me younger to drink this.  It's the Fountain of Youth.  That's right.  From your boy's hairless faucet.  Your boy's pigtail, smooth, hairless faucet.  It's the Fountain of Youth.  It's the Fountain of Youth. 
[03:05:30]  Ponce, you at it again.  Should we take a break?  We got Dr. Cox.  Dr. Cox is falling in.  We'll get more from a little Jimmy Norton with Doug Stanhope.  Stay there.  It's O&A.  Lovely Nordic nymph, jiggly Jimmy Norton.  Know that paltitude is real.  It's real.  Smooth, amoeba-like skin.  Smooth where it counts. 
[03:06:00]  Shaved like a booksum baby.  As hairless as a toad.  Too much for one man.  Without a bad policy.  I hope it's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  On XM 202.  Go fire it.  My heart can't stand it.  My blood's getting cold.  It can change me into something that I'm just getting thrown away.  You see me come and let's get out of my way.  The best of love is swaying back the other way. 
[03:06:30]  Oh yeah.  Talking about gay videos.  Here's one from Foundry.  Our own Steve C. on lead vocals.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Doug Stanhope in Hay House.  Good morning.  Good morning to you, Doug.  How are you today?  I'm pepping up.  So you got a show this weekend.  Tell us about it.  Yeah, I'll be all over the New England states.  All of them but Maine. 
[03:07:00]  Fuck you, Maine.  Wow.  No problem with Maine, do you?  No, I just don't have it on the schedule.  Oh, okay.  On the old schedule.  Fuck them anyway.  Dr. Cox.  Meriden, Connecticut.  All right.  There you go.  Dr. Adam Cox is calling in.  Any moment now?  His book is called No Mind Left Behind.  This is something that our listeners are very, very interested in.  Are they?  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  They are.  It's a fine book and has a lot of tips for your children. 
[03:07:30]  Let's say hi to Dr. Cox right now on the Opie and Anthony show.  Dr. Cox.  Yeah, hi.  How are you?  Good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I'm glad to be with you guys.  Yeah.  We see that your book is called No Mind Left Behind.  Right.  What would you say the basic gist of the book is?  The basic gist of the book is that there are millions of kids being diagnosed with what's  called ADHD, which is almost a very outdated concept. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  The idea is that, you know, a lot of these kids are really having problems with things  that go beyond hyperactivity.  And one of the problems in the United States is that we got so many kids being over medicated  with this psychiatric medication.  And if you're a poor kid in the United States, you're a lot more likely to be medicated with  this stuff than if you're lucky enough to come from a wealthy family.  Well, that's easy to say, doctor.  But do we have hard numbers?  Well, I think that the numbers are coming in. 
[03:08:30]  And I think that what it's all about, the reason for that is that if you come from a  wealthy family, there's a good chance you either go to a private school or at the very  least your family has access to expensive doctors who can give you the kind of information  and guidance that maybe limit the amount of medicine that you're on.  Yes, but Dr. Cox, Dr. Cox, I understand that, if I may interrupt.  But isn't that just survival of the fittest?  Shouldn't the most wealthy of the families be the ones that really do get... 
[03:09:00]  I mean, you know, the world needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  Well, I certainly hope that's not the case.  And let me tell you, to be honest, I was one of these expensive doctors for a lot of years,  and I just got sick and tired of the double standard in children's health care.  I get sick and tired of seeing so many kids unnecessarily on this medicine when there were  things that schools and families could do to help these kids get their brains wired in  the right direction.  So, Adam, is it really possible to immunize a child or teenager for STD? 
[03:09:30]  I really have no idea if it's possible to immunize a teenager for STD.  Oh, immunize, immunize.  What's that word again?  Immunization?  Immunization.  Yeah, immunization.  You might remember from way back when you got a shot when you were a kid.  Sure.  But the deal is, is that there are things that you can do.  It's like, you know, it's like a parent or a teacher is the conductor of an orchestra.  There are ways that we can intervene with kids to actually rewire their brains to limit 
[03:10:00]  the extent to which they have problems with focus, with problems with self-control.  Adam, if I may, not to interrupt, I don't like to, but it sounds good.  But I have to take issue with you here if you have, again, our experiences may be different.  Page 148, I call your attention to, emotional obstacles to living the considered life.  Now, you say here some kids have trouble applying the skills they possess in high-profile situations, 
[03:10:30]  performing in public.  And the example you give, Adam, if I may, Moira finds an excuse to drop out of a play  at the time last minute because she hasn't learned her lines, yet she knows the lyrics  of approximately 200 songs by heart.  Eric is halfway through his college application but hasn't written his essay on time to apply  to his top school.  Eric says he forgot to check the deadline and besides, their football team stinks. 
[03:11:00]  Elaborate, if you would.  Well, the deal there is that a lot of kids have anxiety and they freeze up at moments  when they really got to perform.  Hey, guys like you don't understand that because you guys are so good at this.  Exactly.  And from wealthier families.  Yes.  And from wealthier families.  Everyone at this table.  I have noticed people from wealthier families are just a nicer people to hang around with.  And shouldn't we, I mean, if it's going to make a dish digger, just like Aldous 
[03:11:30]  Huxley's Brave New World.  Yes, yes.  You know what?  Medicate the dumb.  You know, if they're going to, if that's their lot in life is to pump my gas, why not  give them pills that make them happy?  To make them happy doing just that.  Yeah, do you want their brains rewired so they're hyper aware of their lowly lot on this  planet for 70 years?  Doctor, what do you think about giving drugs to people just to make them happy in their  misery?  The same way beer makes a baseball game good, should we not give them drugs that will make  a life of servitude? 
[03:12:00]  Doctor Stanhope's making a good point here, sir.  Well, I think that the critical issue is that no matter what your job is in life, you want  to have a sense of confidence and a sense of, you know, that you have found your way and  you're feeling satisfied with what you're doing.  So, you know, the medicine is not necessarily always a bad thing, but the point is, is that  there's a lot of ways that are healthier to get to that same point of feeling like you  can focus and feeling like you can perform up to your ability without being dependent upon  that medicine. 
[03:12:30]  But you're saying sometimes the medicine is okay?  Yeah, I think it's ridiculous.  Ah, you're being glib.  You're just being glib.  You know, demonizing medicine is like, you know, not a good idea because the medicine  helps some people.  And I make that point in the book as well, it's just that if we do things for kids before  they reach that critical age, and guys, it's age 12, and let's be also clear that it's  boys that are the target of this because boys get diagnosed with these problems four or  five times more frequently than do girls.  Well, that's because women are really still second-class human beings. 
[03:13:00]  Men are still the people getting stuff done.  If a girl's not concentrating, all she needs to concentrate on is feeding a baby.  Let me tell you that one of the big things that science has contributed to understanding  why boys are on this medicine is that if you look at the brain of a boy while he's paying  attention in class, it's doing fine when someone's talking directly to him.  And why would you look at the brain of a girl?  Who cares?  That's true.  Girls are icky. 
[03:13:30]  Girls have a knack for listening so much better than do boys, and it makes a huge difference  in terms of how they perform in school.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Why is that?  I don't even see how that could be.  Aren't we all the same?  Imagine it this way, guys.  And it's not just listening, but it's memory.  Right.  If you had to give somebody a list of 12 items that you wanted to get at the grocery  store, would you rather that person be male or female?  It didn't matter as long as they didn't have Down syndrome.  Well, that could be true, Dr. Norton. 
[03:14:00]  They're going to do a much better job of remembering because guys, we guys remember almost only  things that are important to us as individuals.  So we guys are like computers for sports scores.  Yes.  All this kind of, you know, our favorite snack foods, but it's a problem in school.  So if we're going to the tranny store, you send Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Dr. Cox, we've got a lot of parents listening to our show right now.  Let's get to the very important question here from your book.  What should parents do if their child's teacher or family doctor says the child has an STD? 
[03:14:30]  Well, it's not an STD.  It's ADHD that we're talking about.  Of course.  And if somebody says that your child has ADHD, the first thing you should get is ADHD, guys.  Oh, what's that?  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Oh, that makes this a little different.  You might have heard of it.  It's been in the news a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  What has?  The first thing you should do is get a professional evaluation because some kids have food allergies 
[03:15:00]  or a learning problem or something else going on.  Right.  And that can make them seem stupid.  And the second thing you should do is make it easier for kids to focus and remember.  Like if they're in a classroom where there's a lot of distraction, if they're near a window,  if they don't hear, if they're having some other kind of problem,  you've got to make sure that these kids have some way to focus that's easier for them.  Doctor, doctor, doctor.  Yeah.  I understand.  But what about a good old-fashioned, raised in the 50s and 60s, smack in the face? 
[03:15:30]  Absolutely a bad idea.  Why?  Let me tell you something.  I know how I was raised.  I know how generations of people were raised in this country.  It was called discipline.  It was called discipline.  It was called getting the strap.  It was called getting a backhand across the face if you didn't shut up.  If you were hyperactive or had attention deficit.  Let me tell you.  If my attention wasn't on something that it was supposed to be, I got a smack across my face.  All of a sudden, I'm paying attention to what I was supposed to pay attention to. 
[03:16:00]  It's called discipline.  Doctor, discipline.  Comment?  Yeah.  Discipline counts.  But here's the thing.  Oh, shut it.  We moralize about these problems.  Yes.  And we say, hey, this kid isn't trying hard enough.  He doesn't care enough.  He doesn't feel it, you know, deep enough.  And it's bony because the problem is that he's got a brain problem.  And if we don't do something to help his brain work in an optimal way, all the discipline  in the world, that's going to scare him.  You may contain him for a few minutes, but you're not going to get him to really improve.  Let me tell you about the brain. 
[03:16:30]  My dad got to mind by having it shaken up against my skull a few times.  And I seem to be a normal fucking guy.  I guess the jury's still out on that.  Hey, you want to take a few calls, Doc?  That's cute.  Come on now.  Let's keep it fair.  Let's keep it fair.  If you only do, Doc.  Can you take a few calls from our listeners?  I'd be happy to.  All right.  We got Mike in Houston.  You're on with Dr.  Dr. Cox.  Adam Cox. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, Adam Cox.  I forgot.  I'm sorry.  Mike, go ahead.  I want to talk to the large Dr. Cox.  I got this problem.  I go to a public toilet and I freeze up.  And as soon as I get out, I shit myself.  And it's so embarrassing.  And I just wonder if it has anything to do with my dad, like, peed in my mouth a couple  of times.  Oh, that's not a real question.  Boy, I don't know.  I think that's a complex problem.  It can't be unraveled on the air in just a few short minutes.  I think we were just goofed.  I think we were just goofed.  I think we were.  Sorry. 
[03:17:30]  I believe we were goofed there.  Oh, Dr. Cox.  I think that was one of those listeners in one of those shock jock stations.  I apologize.  Let's go to Barry in Seattle.  Hey, Doc Cox.  I have a chubby little son named Eric, and I want to know if STDs play a role in his  diet as far as eating mayonnaise a lot than his thinner brother.  Again, that goes beyond my expertise because I'm a psychologist.  Thank you.  I know about ADHD, but not STDs. 
[03:18:00]  ADHD he was talking about with his little fat kid, Eric.  ADHD is the virus that causes STDs.  Right.  Oh.  That's a link I'm unaware of, but I suppose there's a possibility.  What is the ADHD?  What is that?  Advanced Human Immune.  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Didn't it just used to be called ADD?  Yeah, but we've done away with that term now.  The American Psychiatric Association now just uses this term ADHD, 
[03:18:30]  and basically uses that as the term to describe people who are just inattentive  as well as those people that are not only have trouble focusing,  but also are like very hyperactive.  The American Psychiatrics.  Why would you listen to a group of crazy people and what they say?  Exactly.  On the phone we got Paul.  Paul, you got a question for Dr. Cox.  Hello, Dr. Cox.  Doctor?  Hi.  How do you feel about spanking a child? 
[03:19:00]  Like you pull down their trousers and you slide down their underpants  and you put them over in your lap and you give them a good spanking.  It's a bad idea generally to spank kids.  Why?  But it feels good.  It humiliates them, and usually it's boys that end up getting spanked,  and one of the worst things we can do with young kids is humiliate them.  But we all got spanked as children, Doc.  Sure.  Well, you know, sometimes you give a very young child a short, light spank  when they're going to do something like run out into the street  where they could really be at risk. 
[03:19:30]  But when we spank kids that get older than three or four years old  and we do it in a punitive way and we humiliate them,  and unfortunately we grow up to resent the people that spank us like that.  Did the senior Mr. Cox spank you, Doctor?  I think when I was a very young child I probably got a couple of spankings.  And you grew up to be a successful psychiatrist.  Are you a psychiatrist or a psychologist?  Psychologist.  Ah, so you can't prescribe any drugs, right?  That's right.  Oh, damn.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  We really don't need to continue with this call.  I was hoping to get a contact.  I'm teasing, of course.  The humor is part of the program.  Dr. Cox, ADHD.  What does that stand for?  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Now, I got an observation here.  It seems like you know a lot about this subject.  What are you going to do with all this info?  Well, what I've been on is a crusade across the United States  talking to schools and families, communities, about how we can intervene. 
[03:20:30]  Now, when you say crusade, are you trying to wipe out Muslims?  No.  My crusade is against a pharmaceutical industry that has committed itself to over-medicating kids.  Well, why travel the country when you can write a book on the subject?  Well, I've decided to do both, so it's really working out well.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on, Dr. Cox.  He's got a book on the subject.  Oh, cool.  I think he said he's working on it.  I just want to make sure we get this out.  Oh, he's working on the book?  You're working on a book as well, Dr. Cox? 
[03:21:00]  Well, the book is out.  You've got it there.  No Mind Left Behind.  Oh, this?  And the eight essential brain skills every child needs to thrive.  Wait, this is yours?  Hey, and by the way, guys, if somebody actually wanted to find out what these eight brain skills  were and whether their kids were up to snuff or not, on my website, DrAdamCox.com, D-R-A-D-A-M-C-O-X.com,  there's a checklist.  You can check it out and find out for yourself if your child might be having a problem with  one of these eight skills.  Yeah, but if they are, are you suggesting that we try to raise super kids? 
[03:21:30]  No.  I'm so glad you asked me that because sometimes people say, yeah, are we trying to raise these  kids who are like, you know, super productive and super efficient?  Well, not really, but if we don't try to...  What's the number one reason these kids are prescribed medication?  It's because they have behavior problems.  And how should someone handle a teacher who insists a child should be on Ritalin?  Ritalin.  Ritalin.  Yeah.  Hey, I mean, have you guys heard of the concept?  Are you suggesting we try to raise super kids? 
[03:22:00]  What's that?  Are you suggesting we try to raise super kids?  I am not suggesting that.  Is it too late for teenagers?  Can we still build their brains?  That's an interesting question.  We can still build their brains.  How should some teachers handle a teacher who insists a child should be on Ritalin?  I believe that was asked earlier.  Well, we've gone through a bunch of things.  Right.  But the main thing is to find out exactly...  Doctor, if I may, what practical things could a parent do immediately to make a noticeable 
[03:22:30]  difference?  Call or you're on the air.  Please answer in 30 seconds or less.  Well, some of the things...  When you're talking about building capable kids, what do you mean?  What I mean are kids that can focus...  Are you suggesting we try to raise super kids?  The bottom line is that...  Is ADHD a real problem?  Why is it so common these days?  Well, it's common because...  Why do boys get diagnosed with STD so much more frequently than girls do? 
[03:23:00]  Right.  You know, it's very tough for kids to step up to the plate and perform...  I'll tell you who tried to raise super kids.  Hitler in 1939 attempted to raise super kids the way you are.  You know, in the early, mid-30s to begin with, and then the later 30s, there was a gentleman  that was trying his own plan of raising super kids.  And if we hadn't a cock blocked him, he might have succeeded.  You know who that was?  Maybe you can succeed too, Dr. Cox.  I think you know who that was, Dr. Cox. 
[03:23:30]  You know how that was?  No, I don't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, on page...  I wish everyone could be as successful as you guys, but some kids need a little bit  of help.  Right.  Dr. Cox...  His name was Mitch Kumstein.  On page 205, it says...  Don't scan.  Find where you want to be.  Can these super kids leap over buildings in a single bound? 
[03:24:00]  Right.  But super kids are also kids that are super efficient, super productive.  You got it.  Yeah, Paris the Thoughtwe have some of those.  Yeah.  Tweakers.  What's that?  Yeah.  Super efficient and super productive like tweakers.  We got a call coming in from Don the Trucker.  Don, you're on with Dr. Cox.  Dr. Cox.  Good morning, gentlemen.  I have it here somewhere.  It's Dr.  Hi, Don.  You're on with the good doctor.  Good morning, gentlemen. 
[03:24:30]  Good morning, doctor.  I just wanted to know, doctor, are you actually endorsing withholding medication from  children with STDs?  Hmm.  Oh.  Hello?  Oh.  Well.  That didn't go well.  Oh.  What was he on about?  What was his...  What was...  What was...  Yeah.  What did he have to say?  I don't... 
[03:25:00]  He wasn't being...  Don't really get to his point.  That didn't go well.  What happened?  What happened to the caller?  The caller, like, asked a real question.  And he hung up.  I...  Stumped the doctor.  Yes.  You know what?  I don't think he'll ever finish his book if that's his attitude.  Yeah.  He really seems to be a little lazy.  I know.  Sounds to me...  No discipline.  Go ahead.  Sounds to me like the old doc needs a dose of stick-to-itiveness.  Yes.  What happened?  He probably has ADD.  I'll say. 
[03:25:30]  What's that?  I think it's HD...  A-D...  It's STD.  HDTV.  HDTV.  He's got high-definition television.  Yeah.  Is that a problem?  Yeah.  It takes your attention away from book writing.  Wow.  That's right.  Yeah.  Are you suggesting we try to raise super kids?  How many fucking times?  Oh, God.  Fucking authors. 
[03:26:00]  We are just the worst, man.  Why'd he hang up?  I don't know.  He had had it.  I'll tell you why.  Because he was being stumped with some tough questions.  Yeah.  And they don't like to be called the test.  See, we put them to the test.  We do.  The test stations just gloss over these things.  They ask them the questions.  They give the answers.  Sure.  We give them impossible questions.  They could never be answered.  Right.  All at the same time.  Right.  Right.  Right.  It was fun.  Right.  Right.  Right. 
[03:26:30]  I actually stole that.  I'll tell you where I got it from.  Bob Kelly played a prank phone call for me one day.  It's a guy pretending to be an older black gentleman.  And he's calling up to have his VCR repaired.  And the VCR guy is trying to talk to him over the phone.  The guy keeps going.  Right.  And he curses too much.  The guy.  This is like.  Let's bring it in.  That sounds funny.  It's before the jerky boys I think.  But the guy is like.  And the motherfucking RCA of VCR.  And the guy would try explaining it.  And the guy would go.  Right.  That sounds funny.  Oh dude. 
[03:27:00]  It's a very funny prank call.  If anybody out there might know who it is.  That's why I'm saying that.  Yeah.  All right.  We got this.  Now push your ass in my face and let me tongue fuck you.  Let me clean your head out with my tongue before you watch it.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Right.  These are these clips from.  It was actually called audio porn.  Back in the 70s they came out on 8-track.  And you'd listen to these instead of watching porn.  And it's not audio from a porn movie. 
[03:27:30]  They went into a studio and poorly did these.  Well that's right.  Phone sex.  The 976 numbers you'd call listening to the recorded stuff.  You remember those?  976.  Yeah.  A telemarketing job where I just dial for free.  Yeah.  Put it on the company bill.  We used to go into the job trailers.  When they're building a new development the trailer is there for the job super and stuff.  We'd go in there and pick up his phone and just call sex lines.  It must have been hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Yeah.  But it was before live stuff.  Oh yeah. 
[03:28:00]  This is recorded stuff.  This is recorded from the Anal Queen.  I'm Carmen the Anal Queen.  And we're keeping track of all the really great lines from this audio porn.  And the acting is horrid.  This is like.  This woman sounds like this.  I can't believe you're fucking me.  Lick my cunt.  Yeah lick my cunt.  Like Mrs. Howell is getting bagged by the professor.  They get the organ music from the old radio shows.  Yeah.  The old radio serials.  You're licking my pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Wonderful.  Wonderful. 
[03:28:30]  Roll over dammit.  Not on your life baby.  You left out the best part.  Put your tongue up my asshole and start licking.  Start licking.  See.  Right.  Right.  Come on Gidget.  He's a man who means business.  Certainly does.  Right.  Oh.  Oh.  Uh.  Dr. Cox calling back.  What happened?  What?  What happened then?  It got dropped right?  Oh.  By who?  I love that.  What? 
[03:29:00]  I think he hung up.  Oh.  What happened?  Why don't we uh.  Try to get him back?  Yeah.  Let's get Dr. Cox back.  Bite me.  Fuck me baby.  Fuck me.  Bite me and fuck me.  Put your hands under my ass and shove your cock up into my belly.  Oh baby you big baby.  Oh.  I think that's a fantastic example of ADHD.  Bite me.  Fuck me.  Bite me.  Fuck me.  She can't commit.  She doesn't know.  Put your hand under my ass. 
[03:29:30]  What do you want?  What do you want?  To be.  Do you medicate her or fucked?  So she just wants to be bitten or?  Yeah.  Bite me.  Fuck me.  Hey baby this is heaven lover.  Oh.  Oh.  You sure as hell are a boy and cock.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's a foley guy there with two coconuts.  Hello?  Hello.  Is this Owen A?  Hey Dr. Cox.  No no no.  Hold on.  Hello? 
[03:30:00]  Hi I'm here.  What happened?  I don't know.  I think something happened on your end.  No.  Who's this?  This is Dr. Adam Cox.  Oh.  Dr. Adam Cox.  Why are you calling the show today?  Well you guys asked me to call you back.  We just talked to you.  Yeah.  Is that the guy we?  Who?  You were just talking to me.  That's right.  The book No Mind Left Behind.  What?  No.  It's over by you.  No Mind Left Behind.  Oh that's a.  What's that book about? 
[03:30:30]  I don't remember.  It's a book about helping kids avoid this problem we call ADHD.  See what you got to do is get you got to get another idea because if you keep writing  the same book over and over again.  We just talked to an author ten minutes ago who had the same idea for a book.  Isn't that a coincidence?  Yeah.  It certainly is.  All right.  So what can you tell us about this STD thing?  Well you guys I think by now we've established it's not STD.  No it's HDTV which is fantastic. 
[03:31:00]  You watch the game on it?  No.  No?  It's clear as a bell.  It's a wide screen and you feel like you're right on the field.  Built for super kids.  Exactly.  HDTV.  Love it.  Hey on page 261 why did you thank Marano Estroff?  Why did I thank her?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's an editor at Psychology Today who has done some good work. 
[03:31:30]  Doctor being a psychologist how do you feel about testing pregnant mothers for the possibility  of Down syndrome?  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  I don't know why you're laughing at Down syndrome.  As a psychologist I don't really have an opinion on that guy.  Why would you laugh at Down syndrome?  That's not funny.  Well no it's not funny.  Why would you laugh at Down syndrome?  I don't know if we could continue this conversation.  That can show if a child's going to have Down syndrome. 
[03:32:00]  And I'm wondering how you feel about that as somebody who's dealing with medications  in children with learning disabilities.  I'm starting to get the feeling that you guys are like you know the guys that I should  have helped with my book many years ago because you're so distracted.  Let's see.  You could have benefited from this stuff.  If we could prevent these children from even entering the world wouldn't that be preferable  to you having to treat them and write books when you could be out having a nice time?  That would not be preferable.  I need a lot of help.  What could you help me with?  Well yeah.  Nature or nurture doctor? 
[03:32:30]  Nature or nurture?  It's always a combination of both isn't it?  ADHD.  ADHD wise.  Do you think there could be a test in utero that we can see if there is and then maybe  you know pull out that plum tomato before it grows into a burden?  Well you'd never want to do that but of course you're right in that there may be a test one  day that will then allow us to start helping these kids very early in their lives.  Perfect race.  So you're thinking of dropping a few Xanax into a vagina so the child can actually maybe 
[03:33:00]  have them before he comes out?  No I wouldn't be thinking of that.  No?  So you're saying that planned parents should have a dumpster full of Pete Rose wigs?  What I'm saying is that parents can do remarkable things if they start early in their lives.  Why are you laughing at that joke?  That's horrific.  So you're saying that it is the parents responsibility for the ADHD and perhaps they're the problem?  I don't think that parents cause ADHD.  Of course not.  But I think parents can do a whole lot to minimize the effect in a kid's life. 
[03:33:30]  And there's nothing so bad as getting to fifth or sixth grade and not having had any help  and then suddenly you feel overwhelmed because that's the age when kids, especially boys,  turn about 10 or 11 and they haven't had any help.  They're in way over their heads because school gets very complicated by the time you get to  fifth or sixth grade.  Now how come some kids can hack it and others are slackers?  Well that's just one of the differences.  Why do some kids play football and some kids can't? 
[03:34:00]  It's just the way that we're all a little bit different.  Well that's more physical.  Race?  More physical than mental.  Yes, and race does come into play in certain aspects of that.  But that's more a physical attribute than mental, sir.  Doctor, I'm thinking it's all in the upbringing.  I'm thinking, and is this predominantly an American disease?  Oh, that's a great question.  I know it is.  I asked it, Anthony.  It is more of a problem in America and the reason for that is that we live at a crazy pace.  The pace of our culture is so hectic and we push kids so hard to be productive, to be 
[03:34:30]  efficient, to be super kids.  Uber, are you suggesting we should try to raise super kids?  That's asked and answered, fellas.  When you raise this breed of the master race, what will the world look like in 100 years?  Good question.  I have no idea because I'm not involved in that plan.  Yeah, because you're against raising super kids.  We found that out. 
[03:35:00]  That's right.  I just want to know, what would be the problem with a race of super children?  Do you see kind of a children of the corn scenario?  Yeah, that's right, because it just escalates and there's no end to it.  And I'm just afraid that, you know, we would have a bunch of kind of, you know, robots out  there performing up to like some kind of super high expectation and we would lose the flavor.  If Bobby Fisher couldn't concentrate on his schoolwork because he was just playing chess  all day, what would you medicate him with?  Great.  Great. 
[03:35:30]  I don't know that I'd medicate him with anything.  Let's go to the phones.  Matt from Queensbury.  Oh, hi.  I'm glad you got the doctor back on.  I had a question for the doctor.  Yes.  You're on with Dr.  Adam Cox.  Oh, hi, Doc.  Oh, hi, Adam.  Welcome to the program.  I have a son.  He's eight years old.  He's in third grade this year.  And some things he's really advanced on.  And other things he's kind of more, you know, average, middle of the road.  And I'm pretty much okay with that.  But it seems like you're suggesting that we should be building super kids. 
[03:36:00]  And I'm just wondering if that really falls into something I should be looking at.  Hmm.  Well, I certainly don't think you should be trying to raise a super kid, but you might  want to give your son a little bit more of an edge.  Yeah, thanks for the question, Matt.  Billy in Connecticut.  Yeah, hi.  Dr. Cox.  Hello, Bill.  With perfecting all of these flaws with every child at such a young age, are you suggesting  that we raise super kids?  Break it!  Are we back from break it?  Oh, we're on the air. 
[03:36:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Super kids.  Dr. Cox, comment.  Let's go to Chris in the Poconos.  Chris?  Hey, guys.  I'm very interested in this.  I've got a couple kids.  Both of them have ADHD.  Sorry to hear that, sir.  And I went to the website, and it was appalling.  It was drcox.com.  It was nothing but porn.  Dr. Cox, comment.  Is there maybe a website that's close to your website?  Yeah.  Because he's saying that...  Well, you've got to think, drcox.com would have a lot of cox on it. 
[03:37:00]  Oh.  How did you spell cox?  C-O-X.  C-O-X.  Oh, C-O-X.  Oh, C-O-X.  Oh, C-O-X.  I can distribute lots of valuable, useful information for parents.  All right.  I got it.  And especially you guys.  You guys ought to be checking out my website, because there's a ton there that can help.  Absolutely.  Yeah, you should have been really upfront about the spelling ahead of time.  Yeah, that would have helped.  Dr. Cox, are you suggesting we raise a race of children that go to super cuts?  No, I'm not suggesting...  No? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, bad haircuts there.  Right.  It's cheap, but it looks like a bowl was on their head.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jamie.  You're on with Dr. Adam Crutch.  Hello?  Jamie?  Hello?  Yes?  You're on with...  Dr. Dix.  Hey, doctor.  First of all, I want to ask you, how can you even use a fucking term like...  Watch your language.  Dropping a Xanax in somebody's vagina that's a child.  And for all you pompous asses that think you know something about children, you've got 
[03:38:00]  to have one before you know what's going on with children.  Very good.  Yeah, which makes me kind of wonder, does anybody there have kids?  I do.  I have three children.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You fucking doctor, you fucking said something like that.  What kind of fucking term is that?  Hey, hey, hey.  Language.  Language.  We understand if you have a disagreement with his...  Yes.  But...  I know a lot of people are upset about you suggesting that we raise super kids.  Yeah.  That's... 
[03:38:30]  Fuck you, man.  It's preposterous.  Fuck you.  Hey, hey, hey.  How do you even use a term like that regarding a child?  Dr. Cox.  Dr. Cox language, please.  Are you saying you don't want to raise super kids?  I gotta...  I hung up on him.  Doc, I do have three kids.  You do?  Yes.  Good.  And only one out of the three has HDTV, so...  Yeah.  How many...  We're talking about technology here, right?  How many children do you have, Dr. Dix?  I have one.  Okay.  One child.  A perfect super child, I suppose. 
[03:39:00]  So, Harry...  That would be great.  Harry.  Harry.  His name is not Harry Cox.  Stop it.  Stop with the juvenile humor.  Yes.  Yes.  Can I help you?  It's Anita on the phone.  Anita.  All right.  We're on the air in three, two, one.  Anita.  And go.  Anita.  Anita Cox?  So, Black.  Black.  Is your book out now, or is it coming out? 
[03:39:30]  The book is out.  No mind left behind.  Is it in libraries?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can get it at your local library.  Frankly, I don't care where you get it, as long as you read it, because I want you  to help your kids.  Well, yeah, I have a hard time reading, because my mind jumps around a lot.  Is there an audio book?  Hey, I gotta ask the good doctor, if this book is about ADHD, right?  Yeah.  Why would you...  How many pages is this thing?  Why wouldn't you just, like, put a lot of information on the first two pages and keep  the rest of them blank? 
[03:40:00]  They just keep going back anyway.  Simplify.  Simplify.  I tell you, if someone had helped your parents with you guys, we wouldn't be...  This conversation would sound very different.  Isn't it the worst?  I know.  What's wrong with this conversation?  Hey, man.  Right.  We're getting some nice...  If this isn't a distraction, I don't know what it is.  We're getting some info out there.  Yeah, the doctor we talked to before you a few minutes back, that went quite smoothly,  so maybe the onus is on you, sir.  Yeah, let's go to Jay in Philly.  He's got a good question for...  All right.  Hey, guys.  Adam, that's right.  Adam, that's right. 
[03:40:30]  Adam.  Does Doc Cox have any kids of his own?  Yeah, he has one, I believe.  Yeah, one child.  Oh, so he's raising...  No, he has three children.  No, he has one.  Oh, that's you.  You have three.  Dr. Norton.  No, I have children.  I'm sorry.  I forgot.  Dr. Norton has...  A three.  I'm looking for a caller with...  We have so many calls coming in with just fantastic questions.  It's amazing.  A lot of people want to talk about this.  Wade in Minnesota.  Wade, you're on with...  Yeah.  Wade. 
[03:41:00]  Wade, you're on with...  Yeah.  Yeah.  A doctor.  Yeah, doctor.  I got a problem.  I'm wondering if I might be a little ADHD because, you know, I'm trying to count the cars  and I keep...  You know, we keep a good count of the cars and every time I go through to try to count  them, I come up a little bit short.  And I got this plan, see, and I can't really put it together.  Wondering if maybe going through the good doctor and maybe he might be able to prescribe  something.  Because I keep kind of going in different directions.  Do I need a wood chip or any? 
[03:41:30]  No.  It sounds like you may have a problem with distraction or you may just have a problem  with counting.  I think you're asking the question of the wrong person.  You should be talking to a doctor.  This is a writer we have on the phone that's written a book about doctors treating ADHD.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  We keep good count of the cars.  We got them.  Yeah.  We got them off.  Yeah.  Well, those are some sweet numbers.  It's a hell of a plan there.  Have you always wanted to be a writer?  Yeah.  Have I always wanted to be a writer?  No. 
[03:42:00]  Yes.  For many years I was an artist.  I became a doctor by accident.  Oh, an artist.  A painter or a sculptor?  A painter, yeah.  A painter.  What's your fascination with doctors?  What's your fascination with doctors?  Then what's your fascination with Cox?  When I was an artist I ended up teaching young kids how to paint and draw.  I came to the realization that that was my calling.  I work with kids and I've spent my life trying to help kids become as good as they can be  without putting them in a situation where it was.  So, Doc, when did you realize you had the ADD? 
[03:42:30]  I'm blessed.  I don't have ADD.  Good.  Good.  Thank God.  Then how could you possibly write about it?  Yeah.  Did you guys...  Well, because I spent over a decade working with kids that do have that problem.  Excuse me.  Lover of...  Lover of...  Lover of...  Is this your first book or is this your second book?  Second book.  Oh, what was the first one about, sir?  It was called Boys of Few Words.  And that was about autism.  You can't communicate.  About boys who have trouble communicating and expressing themselves. 
[03:43:00]  Of course.  Not you guys.  No, no, no.  I would assume that was about to.  I grew up old school.  My dad, if I had trouble communicating, he'd smack me in the head and say,  get the cock out of your mouth and speak, motherfucker.  And that's...  How do you react to that type of...  That's a horrible...  It seems to explain an awful lot.  That's a horrible thing that he should probably look into now that he's older  and perhaps you'd benefit from some type of psychiatry.  Eat a lot of...  Psychologist.  Yeah.  Hey, Craves Unclipped, what would you say is the greatest mistake parents make? 
[03:43:30]  That's a good question.  What would I say is the greatest mistake parents make?  The single greatest mistake, yeah.  Wow, that's a big question.  The biggest mistake they make about what?  About raising their children, of course.  And doing things that will foster an attitude or an atmosphere that would be conducive with ADHD.  But, like, what is the best way, would you say, if somebody wants to kind of step in and circumvent that, like, without it? 
[03:44:00]  Right.  Well, the number one thing that they can do is to try to...  That question is brought to you by Sammy's Aluminum Siding.  Sammy's Aluminum Siding, 4-2-3-3-1-1-2.  Sorry, I just had to get that in.  Hey, ADHD or AD Blu-ray?  What do you think the future holds?  Man, I don't even know what AD Blu-ray is.  Yeah, see?  It's like beta.  Which is easier to treat, a 720p or a 1080i? 
[03:44:30]  Again, I'm afraid I'm not an expert there, guys.  I'm sorry.  Thomas the Trucker, you got a question for...  Hello?  Hey.  Hey, Thomas the Trucker.  You got a question for...  Dr. Adams.  Adam.  Yeah.  Dr.  Yes.  I heard Dr. Cox saying spanking's a bad idea.  I was wondering if he had any other suggestions for discipline.  Well, there's a lot of different ways that you can discipline.  Not fucking work.  Not fucking work.  Oh, my goodness. 
[03:45:00]  I'm sorry?  My goodness.  You don't want to hear that, sir.  That was obviously a prank caller.  I'm really sorry about that.  But he did, yeah.  I don't know where these people come from sometimes.  I have noticed a lot of drug commercials on, doctor.  Over the past 10 years or so, we just seem to be inundated with these drugs.  Like, for the slightest problem, we're supposed to go ask our doctor about this.  How do you feel about that?  I think you're right.  I think that's an excellent point.  Thank you. 
[03:45:30]  Yes, Anthony again.  I'm over-dependent upon medicine for all kinds of things, including when we kids have  like a...  Hey, baby, this is heaven lover.  Oh, you sure is how I am born, copsman.  Oh, I love it this way.  Oh!  That's how I feel.  I would care about your answer if I just hadn't had so much Xanax today.  But that's a good answer to a great question.  I'm glad you think so.  Yeah.  Have you ever been on any type of psychiatric drugs? 
[03:46:00]  Well, I'm not sure how that's relevant to our interview here today.  Oh, that's a yes.  Because it would almost give some validity to the anti-drug stance you're taking.  Yeah.  Well, the important thing is not what medicine you guys have taken or what medicine I may  have taken, but the important thing is that young minds...  My child has what they call leukemia, and they try to push a lot of drugs on us, chemotherapy, 
[03:46:30]  radiation.  And I say, no, we're doing this all natural.  Right.  It's a very different situation.  Herbal teas, ointments...  It's a life-threatening situation, and you need to use...  In that case, of course, medicine is going to be the best option.  Well, let's see.  But what we're talking about, guys, what the book is about, what we call options of first resort.  Options of first resort.  Right.  Now...  The medicine should be an option of last resort, and what I'm writing about are the options  of first resort.  What should you do before...  Tommy Westchester, you've got to imagine. 
[03:47:00]  Gotcha.  Dancing with gay guys is on Springer.  Hi, guys.  Yeah.  Listen, I'm trying to raise a super kid.  Yep.  And he's 11 years old, 142 IQ.  We went into the bedroom where he was supposed to be studying, and he says to us, he's in my  wife's dress, he says, I like to wear nail bottles, and watch werewolf movies.  Isn't that young...  I remember your call.  His name is William, right?  His name is young William.  Yeah.  So what do I do?  I tried my best, and he's wearing ladies' dresses, and... 
[03:47:30]  Let him do as he pleases.  Right, doctor?  Yeah.  All right, William.  Come on out, William.  Come on, William.  Talk to the doctor.  Uh, doctor, um...  William, please.  All right, thank you.  I think William's queued up.  Uh, doctor, are you a fan of, uh, yellow discipline?  I'm a fan of what?  Yellow discipline for kids that are suffering from ADHD.  I don't know what that is, guys.  I don't know what yellow discipline is.  Oh, okay. 
[03:48:00]  A child that's, uh, afraid of monster rain, say.  Uh, where that's something he really should be taking part in.  That's true.  That freezes up right before the monster rain.  Yeah.  Uh, that's not something I know anything about.  Another thing that, uh...  Hmm.  So you think these drug companies are, uh, making a big bucks off of our, uh, children  when this can be treated in the home just by parenting and, uh, lessons that can be learned  from your book? 
[03:48:30]  Absolutely.  Now, the five things you must do if they say your child has, uh, STD.  I would say to the teacher, uh, probably something, excuse my language, but I'd say,  bullshit, you're the one that's screwed up.  And then I'd grab my kid by the arm and pull really hard and get him out of that school.  Right.  Yes.  Let me ask you guys about this because here's one of the five things you should do is like,  you should be a coach rather than a boss.  Coach?  Everybody hates the voice of a boss, but people kind of like and respond to the voice of a 
[03:49:00]  coach.  You know what I mean?  It's more of a, a boss is talked down to you.  Yeah.  A coach or something is more talk you up.  Motivate you.  Right.  And our boss is a drunk.  Yes.  That's exactly the difference.  Yes.  And also, again, Anthony, Anthony, my name is Anthony Cumia, by the way.  I like to think of myself as the Bobby Knight in my son's life.  Well, probably a bad coach to take an example of.  Well, it's effective.  It's effective.  You choke your kids. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  That's not what a coach does.  No.  But a coach can be very demanding.  Hey, you guys watched football yesterday.  There's a lot of very demanding coaches.  Certainly did.  Made a bundle.  They're hard on those players, but the players play up to their ability because they're not  talking to them like they're a boss.  They're not talking down to them.  Yeah.  And they all shower together at the end.  And that's what.  Colleen Miller.  That's what made Bill Parsons great.  The spinning hope people.  So shower with your children.  Donuts in the snow.  Donuts in the snow.
