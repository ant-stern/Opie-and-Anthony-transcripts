<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a barrage of topics.  The hosts mocked David Blaine's stunt, contrasting it with supposedly safer, radio-show-inspired equivalents.  They heavily criticized the Mets' performance and Tom Brady for shopping during a game.  Anthony detailed his recent breakup, including a humorous "hostage exchange" of belongings with his ex-girlfriend.  A caller corrected Jimmy's memory of a post-Thurman Munson Yankees game. The demolition of Yankee Stadium and the sale of its parts (even shower doors and carpet!), along with a lawsuit over the last home run ball, were discussed. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominations sparked debate, with Jeff Beck's inclusion and Kiss's exclusion being particularly contentious.  This segment also featured a previous guest appearance by Michael K. Williams ("Omar" from *The Wire*).

The show continued with a discussion about music, featuring Edwin Starr, Eric Burdon and War, revealing some inaccurate musical knowledge from the hosts. A caller offered a brief history of War.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was again criticized, with homophobic slurs used to describe Bobby Womack,  while Run-DMC received praise. A snippet of "Where Have You Been, Billy Boy?" from *Bill* was played.  The bulk of this segment centered on a discussion of the unexpectedly hilarious movie *Bill*, with detailed descriptions of scenes, focusing on Bill's unhygienic behaviors.  The hosts discussed other unexpectedly funny films.  The conversation then shifted to *Dancing with the Stars*, specifically Jeffrey Ross's participation and Cloris Leachman's profanity.  A caller suggested the show's popularity among middle-aged fathers, which the hosts entertained. Peyton Manning's impending call-in was mentioned.

Peyton Manning then called in, discussing Eli's career, Tom Brady's injury, Super Bowl predictions, and his DirecTV commercial campaign.  He remained diplomatic.  The conversation continued with further commentary on the Mets, the Emmy Awards, a bizarre Microsoft commercial anecdote, and Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up show.

The show then transitioned to a scathing critique of a poorly-received Seinfeld/Bill Gates commercial.  This led to a discussion of Dog the Bounty Hunter's show, criticizing its perceived lack of diversity among arrestees.  Jerry Seinfeld's comedic style and need for a supporting cast were debated, along with a humorous anecdote involving Bob Kelly and a dollar bet. The hosts replayed the Seinfeld/Bill Gates commercial, reiterating their dislike. A very rambling segment followed, discussing potential job losses at XM, interspersed with crude, sexually charged banter with a lone fan in the studio.

A musical guest, Gray Wolf (a previously homeless man with a troubled past including jail time), was introduced.  He performed an unfinished song and shared his story, seeking help from social services to prove his homelessness. He mentioned selling Andean music CDs on Avenue J. The hosts made several unsuccessful calls on his behalf to secure housing.  Gray Wolf subsequently set up his belongings in the studio, with the hosts engaging in more crude humor.

Gray Wolf continued to be a major presence, setting up his makeshift performance area with pan flutes and other instruments. He discussed street life, strategies for protecting belongings, and performed several songs.  Jay Mohr called in, promoting his CBS show, engaging in banter with the hosts and commenting on Gray Wolf.  The conversation included off-color jokes.  The intern’s unusual noises were also mentioned.

The final segment was chaotic, featuring discussions about NYC traffic (56th street specifically), listener "lines of the day" (including one about a "monumental floppy"), and further antics from Gray Wolf, whose behavior was described as "shitty" after a belching incident during a song recording.  The hosts joked about a burka, Peyton Manning, and the presence of the President and the Iranian leader in the city. Gray Wolf discussed a hand truck home improvement project.  The broadcast ended abruptly.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Hi.  I'm embarrassed to be a New Yorker today.  David Blaine is hanging upside down somewhere.  Getting all sorts of coverage in the newspapers for another hack stunt.  God, do we hate this guy.  Now there's rumors that he could die or go blind.  And Anthony made a good point just before we turned the mics on. 
[00:00:30]  That's David Blaine starting those rumors.  He's got to bring some excitement and danger to the hanging upside down stunt.  For the rest of America, God, I hope they're not covering this dumb stunt in your city.  He's hanging upside down for 50 hours, 55 hours, 60 hours.  60 hours upside down.  And then he's going to do what's called the dive of death. 
[00:01:00]  Well, does he die?  Then it's not the dive of death.  What is he doing?  Like diving into a thing of Jell-O?  What is he doing?  Seriously, what is he doing?  Anything David Blaine do, Bruno do better.  I will jump into a wet sponge on my head yet.  Can we find out what the dive of death is?  I'm so scared for David Blaine.  The dive of boredom. 
[00:01:30]  It's embarrassing.  And I don't know why this city allows him to do a stunt every year.  It's another dumb stunt that most morning zoos have done.  For some reason, yeah.  They allow this because they think it brings revenue into the city.  People are coming in going, I got to see this.  Yeah.  We got to leave Ohio and drive to New York so we can see David Blaine upside down.  Well, he's getting the tourism dollars up here in New York City.  Is that what he's doing? 
[00:02:00]  I guess.  Jimmy, didn't you go see him when he was buried alive?  Which amounted to, listen to this.  And there was a company, I was discussing this with Stump Ring because he goes way back  in this radio thing.  There used to be a company that would come to your town and they would bury your morning  zoo alive in front of a car dealership or they would put the morning show in a block  of vice and they're all just dumb stunts that are very, very safe.  And David Blaine is now doing these stunts. 
[00:02:30]  They're hacky radio kids.  And no one is calling him out on how hacky and ridiculous this is.  If it's something a morning zoo did, it's not that impressive.  Right?  Absolutely.  And I think those were failed morning show guys who knew all the marketing stunts.  Right.  You know, they put you in a box on a billboard and you had to guess what was in the box and  they'd unveil it.  Well, there's been a box.  Yeah.  No, there was a company that wanted to bury us alive when we were up there in the Worcester  area.  Yeah.  And basically they put a camera in there and you're just hanging out bored. 
[00:03:00]  There's nothing going to happen to you.  And people come walking by all day long and see you on a TV like, hey.  Buried alive.  I'm six feet below you.  I'll be coming out on Monday.  So have a good weekend.  It's like looking at a guy in a basement apartment.  Of course.  In a very small basement apartment.  And oxygen.  Of course.  And the ice stunt drove.  We were yelling and screaming when that went down.  Yelling and screaming that there was all.  The hardest thing he had to do was not eat and not sleep, obviously, and stand on his 
[00:03:30]  feet for a few days.  Yeah.  The ice.  He was warm as could be in there because it's like an igloo situation.  Yeah.  He wasn't touching the ice.  There was space between him and the ice, which means he was in a very comfortable environment  and everyone bought into it.  Oh, my God.  He's in the middle of a block of ice.  No, he's not.  No.  Actually freeze him in a block of ice.  That would be impressive.  Right.  You can stay in an ice hotel.  Right.  In Finland.  Yeah.  You can actually rent a place like that. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  We should come up with some dumb stunt.  Go to the mayor of this city and go, look, this is what we want to do.  He'll say no.  We want to, like, do handstands.  I'm going to take a nap on a big pile of fake rubber duty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, at the end of the challenge, David Blaine will take a plunge.  Exactly how he will do this dive is not being revealed.  He'll be lowered down to the street.  And then he'll do the dive of death and then he'll have to get up like, oh, God. 
[00:04:30]  He'll do the dramatic thing.  Oh, God.  And then make his face.  Right.  Make his patented David Blaine face.  I like when he does that street stuff.  Yeah.  Street musician stuff.  The close-up magic he does.  It's amazing.  When he does close-up stuff, it's incredible.  I'll give him that.  But these dumb stunts he comes up with.  Man, the papers, they eat it up.  They're lame.  And they say he has a catheter in there.  I don't know if he went that far. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, he's had a lot of catheters in.  Yeah, yeah.  Must be a mess.  I think he enjoys the catheter.  Yeah, put the catheter in.  Why aren't we putting the catheter in?  I love catheters.  Catheterer.  I know.  Just catheters.  Catheterer.  I've got to say it that way.  Let's say hi to Nick in Buffalo.  Nick.  How are you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  You're talking about David Plain.  If he wants to perform some magic, he should do something and get the Mets the wild card. 
[00:05:30]  Oh.  The Mets are doing exactly what they're supposed to do.  Choke.  Punch it out, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Well, now one game up for the wild card spot, which they could easily just.  At least we could get the wild card.  Right, guys?  Right?  Right?  Oh, Billy.  They lose a couple of games.  Billy Baroo.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  This is a biggie.  Oh, they just are tanking again. 
[00:06:00]  It's a replay of last season.  The Phillies are now two and a half games up.  Yeah.  We were just up.  I don't know.  I've got to go back a week or two.  What happened?  We had a nice, cushy little lead there.  Now we're fighting for the stupid wild card with the Brewers.  Again, they're blowing it.  That annoys me.  He's not even a Met fan.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Speaking of baseball, Jimmy, you were bringing it up.  We're all over the place.  We're just kind of giving the round up.  Clemens was left out of the ceremonies. 
[00:06:30]  It's like I could see not having him there.  What are you going to say that the guy didn't help you win championships?  It's stupid.  What about the steroid scandal?  Big D, don't show Billy Martin because he was a drunk and he had fistfights with Thurman  and Reggie in the dugout.  We're going to show half the guys.  They didn't face blacks.  I mean, you know.  Did they show Joe Torre?  No.  They didn't show him.  They had to have.  I don't think they.  They had to have shown him.  Maybe I tuned in late.  Did they show Torre, Travis? 
[00:07:00]  You were watching the.  We're talking, of course, the last game in Yankee Stadium.  And they did it like a montage of some of the great players at every position.  And they did a whole pitching thing and they didn't show Clemens whatsoever, which is kind  of silly.  Absolutely.  It was silly.  They didn't show Clemens, but I'm pretty sure they showed Torre and Mattingly when they did  the first baseman.  Oh, okay.  But yeah, there was no Clemens when they went through the pitchers.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Just show Clemens.  What are you doing? 
[00:07:30]  Why do you have to overthink everything?  There's no one in George's box.  Well, Steinbrenner wasn't there either.  No, no.  Something's going on with Georgie.  Georgie.  Georgie's been a little screwy for years now.  Yeah.  But good decade.  Something's been wrong with that guy.  When he was crying in the locker room.  Best team in baseball.  His mouth was all.  Got his crazy Eddie turtleneck on.  Yeah.  Just looking like an ass. 
[00:08:00]  They're starting to sell all the stuff from Yankee Stadium.  Yep.  But there was something, I guess, I think they said something like 18 people were arrested.  One guy almost got away with it, man.  He got on the field after the game, blended in with the grounds crew.  Yeah.  And just picked up third base.  Like, ah, I'm picking up third base.  You know, game's over.  And he almost got away with it.  They said this guy blended in so well, but at the last second someone was like, wait a minute.  And checked him. 
[00:08:30]  He had third base.  Supposedly he had dirt.  He had all sorts of stuff he was able to get.  Well, I thought you could just come down.  And what were you saying, Travis?  No, I noticed that after the eighth inning, they took home plate and put a new home plate in.  Oh, they did.  Just in case.  They wanted to have that home plate.  Yeah, but now the new home plate.  But the new home plate is the new home plate.  And that's more valuable than the one they took away because that's the last one.  That's the last one.  What are they doing?  They just made another home plate famous. 
[00:09:00]  More valuable home plate.  It has to be.  Dude, this is the last home plate that was in Yankee Stadium.  I don't know what paper, because they're all just nonsense to me, these rags.  But one of the papers has a list of the stuff you could buy from Yankee Stadium,  including, like, shower doors.  Yeah, what do you want that for?  You could buy a locker room shower door, glass shower door for, like, $2,000, something like that.  Does it have a logo on it?  I mean, unless it has a logo on it, what the hell are you going to do with it? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, you know what?  If you have a glass shower door, just say, hey, I got this at Yankee Stadium.  No one's going to know.  Yeah, this is the one.  This is it.  This is it.  Did I pay through the gills for this one?  And then, oh, here it is.  Okay, you could buy a clubhouse shower stall.  For $2,000.  Old stall, huh?  You could get the Yankees clubhouse carpet for $10,000 with the New York logo on it.  All right.  You could get some chairs and whatever.  Yeah, they like selling those chairs. 
[00:10:00]  Plenty of them.  Mostly junk.  And then they have a list of what the Yankees own and what the city owns.  Yeah, who knew?  Because there's a lot of money to be made.  The Yankees own the dirt, the turf, the lockers, the dugouts, the benches in the dugouts, and the bases, including home plate, the backstop, the scoreboard.  That's what the Yankees own.  The city owns the seats, the foul pole.  Why do they own the foul poles?  We own the foul poles.  The city owns the public bathroom fixtures, all the signs, the water fountains, the light fixtures, the elevators, the ticket counters, the ticket booths, the flag poles. 
[00:10:30]  The stadium letters on the outside is owned by the city, not the Yankees.  See, now that would be something.  Imagine getting the Y, the big Y from Yankee Stadium.  Or the bat.  Or the, what would you do with the giant bat?  Put that in the backyard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's also Seinfeld memorabilia.  A lot of shots of that bat.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  And then finally, there was a guy, the last home run was hit at Yankee Stadium.  I don't even know who hit it because I, I couldn't, I think.  All right.  Because I couldn't be bothered watching.  Well, lean on.  I watched the opening ceremonies, but I couldn't.  Total recall.  I couldn't be bothered watching the entire game, right?  So, the last home run is hit, and there's, I think it was a black dude.  He, there's a net, so the fans can't get the ball.  Yeah.  So, he just grabs the ball through the net.  But he can't get it through the net, so he's just holding it. 
[00:11:30]  Like, I got the last home run ball.  This is the weirdest story going right now.  Was it like a monkey with his fist in a hole trying to get some food out of there,  but when he's got a fist, he can't pull it back out?  Is that what the guy was saying?  He had the baseball.  Well, the guy's actually holding the net and the ball at the same time.  That doesn't mean you have it.  There's no way you can pull the ball through the net.  I would ask for a pocket knife.  I said, look, it's the last freaking game.  Who cares if I cut this net?  So, the guy's just holding it.  I don't know for how long.  And the security guys come along and go, look, you've got to let the ball go. 
[00:12:00]  And the guy goes, what?  So, they force him to let go.  So, he lets go of the ball, and now it rolls off the net, and another guy catches it.  So, now that guy's like, I got the last home run ball.  Yeah.  Security guards go to that guy and say you have to give it back to the guy that was originally holding it through the net.  So, now the guy who caught it after it rolled off the net is suing.  Of course he is.  Because he's saying, I got it.  Wow.  Wow.  Well, security, like, is that their job? 
[00:12:30]  To determine who gets a ball that could be worth a lot of money?  Well, that's why there's a little, you know, a little controversy today.  Anyway, they're even brawling over the last home run ball.  Yankee fan Paul Russo says he is the rightful owner of the ball smacked by Molina.  Very good.  Over the left center field fence during the historic final game.  I was a part of history, and it's making me sick, said Russo, 31 of Manhattan.  The soaring shot landed on the netting.  He caught a hiss to me.  It's making me sick, said Russo.  That covers his seats in front of the famed Monument Park. 
[00:13:00]  He's doing a very good job on Sirius XM, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  The Mad Dogs show is very good.  Another fan identified only as Steve grabbed the ball through the netting,  but he let it go, and it bounced down into Russo's hands.  When security guards told Russo to give the ball back,  he thought they were going to help him get the valuable piece of his blah, blah, blah.  All right.  I thought they were helping me out, said Russo, who teaches that, blah, blah, blah.  The next thing I know, they handed it to the other guy who was holding it originally.  So now there's going to be a little lawsuit over this dumb last ball. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, Juan, the guy stopped being a dick.  The guy who had it through the fence had it, through the net had it.  Oh, and that guy wasn't letting go.  He held it for a while.  Like, what am I, you know, someone help me here.  This is my ball.  But he didn't really have it.  Why not?  It's like if the ball is on the other side of a wall, and it's touching the wall,  and then you touch the other side of the wall and go, well, I'm touching the wall.  Yeah.  So the ball's mine.  It's not his.  If it was his, he would have had it.  If it's through the net, and you can't get it through the net, it's not yours. 
[00:14:00]  That's it.  He should have, if he was there with somebody, he should have had them hold the goddamn thing.  He runs down where it would have popped off.  It would have been a fight.  And then, yeah, then at least it would have been a fair fight.  All right, well, let her go.  I like memorabilia, but is it really that big of a deal that that stadium is finally done? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  You think?  For, you know.  Because the one they're building right next door looks exactly the same.  Like, what are they doing?  What a waste of money.  Couldn't they just, like, refurbish the damn place and do what they needed to do?  70s, they did that.  Yeah, I know, but they showed a picture of the new stadium.  Man, it looks a lot like the one they're destroying.  It's nice.  It's all about those luxury boxes.  They're going to make millions off all those.  For the corporation.  That's it.  The new one over by Shea looks real nice, too. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  That one passed by there the other day.  They're doing a little Camden Yards.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, well, everyone's doing the same style.  Looks pretty cool, though.  Yeah.  I've got to admit.  I'm psyched, because that was...  It's been in a big blue toilet bowl that's been there for years.  Yeah, that was it.  It's just an awful-looking stadium.  A crap hole for so long.  Mikey, what are you doing, man?  I just want to tell you guys, there was dopes yesterday collecting paint chips off the side  of Yankee Stadium.  It was ridiculous.  Paint chips?  Feed them to your children.  It was funny, because five minutes later, there was no one there. 
[00:15:30]  Like, people were just like, oh, someone's getting something from the side of the stadium.  I've got to get two.  Five minutes later, there was no one there.  It was ridiculous.  I guess it's like this big panic, people running around.  I've got to grab something off of the stadium.  I guess I would want a seat.  Yeah.  I'd take home a seat.  What else would you want from there?  Like, something that is...  Jeter's locker door.  Well, I mean, something...  Oh, there you go.  Something obtainable, though.  Like, a seat.  Like, what else, really?  Some dirt?  What do you do with the dirt after a while? 
[00:16:00]  You put it in a little jar.  You label it Yankee Stadium dirt.  Hey, get me...  Warning track dirt.  Stunt brain.  Give me some Yankee Stadium dirt.  Pitcher's Mound dirt.  I want some Joe Pepitone used toilet paper.  Yeah, there you go.  Joe Pepitone.  We might have to break out an old character today, huh?  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  Maybe we should do some writing today.  Yeah, maybe we should jot a few things down.  Want to do some writing today?  Why not? 
[00:16:30]  Break out an old character?  Why not?  This is the warm-up break.  We're going to...  Paint chips.  I think we're going to do some writing.  Yankee Stadium paint chips.  A few of these were sold years ago to a governor up in Alaska.  Very dangerous.  Dangerous paint chips. 
[00:17:00]  It's amazing how that got tied in.  Of course.  And speaking of which, Blue Heeler, he's good for a few, from Kentucky.  He writes, Opie, please tell me you're going to talk about Clinton.  Clinton said voters would think, I like that little Down Syndrome kid.  One of them lives down the street.  They're wonderful children.  They're wonderful people.  Did Clinton really say that?  On The View?  I don't know.  Try to find that.  Bill Clinton said that?  Yeah.  He was on The View yesterday.  It's not outrageous.  Didn't he do a Tonight Show as well, or no? 
[00:17:30]  That's an old one.  It might be.  Oh, here it is.  Clinton said voters would think, okay, I like that little Down Syndrome kid.  One of them lives down the street.  They're wonderful children.  They're wonderful people.  And I like the idea that this guy does those long-distance races.  Stay in the race for 500 miles with a broken arm.  What kind of a...  My kind of guy.  What?  That's the husband.  The hubby with his snowmobile racers.  Snow machine racers.  He rode a snowmobile for 500 miles?  Yeah.  He does those long-distance, massive races.  I've driven back and forth to Buffalo on a weekend. 
[00:18:00]  I'm a snowmobile.  But you had a car around you.  Same thing.  What kind of endurance is it, really?  Chris, West Palm.  Two days in a row.  What's wrong with you, Chris?  Nothing.  Wrong Chris.  Good morning.  I didn't know you were here today.  Happy birthday, Yimmy.  Hi.  Hey, listen.  You've just glanced over the fact that a guy named Stevie had his hand through the net  holding a ball.  We love you, Steve.  Love you, Steve.  Bye.  And he's not here today, so... 
[00:18:30]  Where is he?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's in court.  He's in court?  He's in court?  Oh.  No.  Why is he in court today?  He's having his own fun.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break, then?  And then I wanted to, when we come back, just how bad memory is.  Like, you think you remember something a certain way, and you're sure you remember it a certain  way, and you don't.  Like, whether it was season one of The Wire or season two?  Kind of.  Oh, my God.  I heard that.  How funny was that?  I heard that. 
[00:19:00]  Jimmy, for the people that didn't hear, we had Michael...  Michael K. Williams.  Michael K. Williams.  Yes.  Omar from The Wire on Friday's show, and Jimmy was arguing what season a certain scene was  in with the guy.  And the guy's like, no, that was season two, and Jimmy's like, no, no, I remember it as season  one.  No, no, I remember it as season one.  He could be wrong.  It's like, no, he did it.  He did it.  He's not going to be wrong.  I did acknowledge the silly goose-ishness of me debating the man who did the scene.  You were debating it.  It was so funny. 
[00:19:30]  I kind of was with you, though, Jimmy.  I still think it was season one.  It was the, what up, bird?  Yes.  And I thought that was season one, too.  But Omar swears it was season one.  What up, bird?  Wait until you get to, what up, bird?  What up, bird?  Anthony's going to...  Sink the guy for life.  Anthony's going to start watching The Wire.  Put the thing on, the closed caption thing.  The thing!  Yeah, because, you know, it's street language at times, and you get a little, you're going  to want to do some reading.  I noticed that they, I watch the first 48, you know, where they take a crime, a murder, 
[00:20:00]  and within the first 48 hours, you really got to get a good lead, or else chances of catching  the guy are pretty slim.  Sure.  So, I was watching that, and they put subtitles for every black guy that talks on that show,  because you cannot understand one goddamn word coming out of their mouth when they're  being interrogated.  Unbelievable.  It's come to that.  Fix that!  It's wrong!  Fix that! 
[00:20:30]  How do you fix that?  It's English, you shouldn't need subtitles.  But how do you fix that?  Yeah, education.  Just fix it?  The two parents that teach the kid how to speak properly.  It's funny, the concern is not that some guy shot another guy.  No, he's speaking.  He's not speaking eloquently.  He's not speaking the king's English.  With that, we got to take our first break.  We're off to a fine start here.  Phone number for the people that don't have it, 877-212-01-DAY.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:21:00]  Like I'm on a cruise.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We got to mention that the Jets, they're playing like the Jets should be playing, by  the way.  Even with Brett Favre.  Ah, yeah, you had all that hype in New York when they signed Brett Favre. 
[00:21:30]  And this is exactly how they're supposed to be playing.  Yeah.  They're 1-2.  Chargers kicked their ass last night.  48-29.  That's a high-scoring game.  Ah, they started off nice and then, you know, then the Chargers did what they were supposed  to do.  Chargers are a very good team this year and they needed a win desperately, so there you  go.  Jets will be lucky to go 7-9 this year.  But everyone's excited. 
[00:22:00]  They ran out and got their Brett Favre jerseys.  They'll have two mediocre seasons for the Jets.  And then retire as a Packer.  Retire and go into the Hall of Fame as a Packer.  As a Packer.  And he'll forget that he even played for the Jets.  That's how that always works out in the end.  Yeah.  With these superstars at the end of their careers.  Goodness gracious.  And then in the Boston paper today, there's a little outrage because while the Patriots  were getting their asses handed to him, Tom Brady was shopping with his kid.  So there's a lot of sports fans up in Boston really mad that Brady wasn't sitting in 
[00:22:30]  front of a TV watching his team.  Why?  They care.  Why are people in Boston never happy?  The guy did nothing but win for you.  Yeah.  He's hurt.  He's probably depressed.  And you're mad that he's not sitting there at Bill's Bar with you?  Leave him alone.  Watching the game.  Stop worrying about who he's banging or what he's doing.  He did nothing but win games for you.  Yeah.  Shut your faces.  And I'll tell you that November 15th when I'm up there doing my show. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, Jimmy!  Hey!  Oh, no.  Dude.  Wow.  I didn't even see that coming.  By the way, not boo for your comedy.  Yeah.  Boo for your horrendous plug.  It's not even about me at the Wilbur Theater.  I'm not plugging it.  You use your tongue, Bertier, and a $20 whore.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, please.  Ticketmaster is schmicketmaster.  This is about Tom Brady.  Yeah.  And them worrying about what this guy's doing with his free time.  Who cares where he is?  Would you want to sit there and watch the game if you can't play all season? 
[00:23:30]  He doesn't buy the jerseys.  He doesn't buy the hats like you guys do.  He's the team.  He's hurt.  Yeah.  He's the guy.  He's the guy.  He's a bit depressed.  That's about loyalty.  I don't know.  You watch the game.  You wear the stuff.  I don't know if you were paying attention, but he had a really, really, really tough loss  last year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a bit depressed, and all he wanted was to get back on that field and go, let's erase  this memory, march toward another Super Bowl, and then, what, 16 plays in, he's out for 
[00:24:00]  the season?  He's got to be out of his mind.  Yeah.  He's got to be out of his effing mind.  Like, you've got to be kidding me.  I can't play?  And make this nightmare go away?  When you go to your job, and maybe you get injured on the job, and you're on workman's  comp for a while, do you grab a lawn chair and set it up at work and watch everyone  else work?  Hell no.  And do your job?  A guy do your job?  Yeah.  Watch some other guy do your job?  Hell no.  These star athletes are just like you and I, man.  Opportunities to not work and not have to go to the job? 
[00:24:30]  Exactly.  Enough of sports fans.  That Bleach Giant Blue!  I hope you do.  All over the inside of a windshield.  Oh, enough with that.  Loyal, we get it.  The dumb Giants are 3-0.  You love the team with it.  Anyone, we know.  I'm suffering here.  Yeah.  Got the Mets falling apart.  Someone was keeping track, by the way.  The Mets were three and a half games up 13 days ago. 
[00:25:00]  Ah.  Now they're two and a half games down.  And we were saying on this show, there's no way they could do this two years in a row,  have the complete collapse.  They're trying their best, though.  They're barely holding on to the wild card position.  They're one game ahead of the Brewers.  Yeah, they could lose that in no time.  I'm dying with the Mets.  I'm dying with the Jets.  And hockey season right around the corner.  Yeah, get with your Islanders, please.  I just got my tickets in the mail because I'm a season ticket holder.  Half season.  Does it come with an apology note right at the beginning of the season? 
[00:25:30]  Well, here are your tickets.  We're sorry.  You know what?  You're not too far off because that's what I'm getting at.  I do a half a season because I can't go to all the games, you know, getting up to do mornings, right?  And they're giving me, like, coupons for, like, 20% off at this restaurant and this thing and this thing,  like, at the top of the ticket.  I want good hockey team and you give me coupon?  Almost like, yeah, I'm sorry that you're a season ticket holder  and you're kind of going to have another mediocre year. 
[00:26:00]  So here, maybe this will help.  Yeah.  Some coupons and stuff.  And then they're like, we gave you every great game.  We gave you all the Ranger games, all the Penguin games.  We never do this.  And I'm sitting there at home going, oh, boy, how bad do they think this team's going to be this year?  Are they trying their best?  So, Jimmy, you were talking about your memory.  What's that about?  I just realized yesterday I was – the Yankees are doing this cool thing  where they're showing old games, Yankee classics.  And this one was from 79. 
[00:26:30]  It was the first game back after Thurman Monson was killed.  And I vividly remember this game on television.  I remember my Uncle Joe and I watching it.  And I remember Reggie crying on the outfield.  It was like an 11-minute standing ovation if I remember correctly.  I missed that part during this replay.  But it was a long emotional ceremony.  And I swore to God that they lost that game 1-0.  I mean, I would have bet – I literally would have bet my apartment on it.  Wow.  And I remembered that they lost that game, I believe, to Oakland, 1-0. 
[00:27:00]  So, it was on yesterday.  And I realized, no, it's not Oakland.  It's Baltimore they played.  And I'm zipping through it.  And Ron Guidry was pitching.  I didn't remember that.  And it turns out that all of a sudden I see the score is 4-3, Baltimore.  And the Yankees won in the ninth, 5-4 on a Mercer single.  And I'm like, how did I remember that?  Differently.  But I knew – I remembered it.  That's why eyewitnesses suck.  Like, I knew. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You would have – yeah, bet anything on it and just been, this is how it happened.  I was as convinced of that as I've ever been about a sports fact in my life.  That they lost 1-0 the next day.  And I remember, like, yeah, they couldn't.  They just couldn't because they were depressed about Thurman.  They couldn't.  You know what you should have done is probably have found Biff, grabbed the sports almanac,  and looked up the score before, you know, the game was played.  Because he could have done that with the sports almanac. 
[00:28:00]  Because that's what Biff did.  That's how he built his empire, Biffco Industries.  And see, then you wouldn't have to guess, or depend on your memory,  you would have had the sports almanac.  Yeah.  Or I could have just grabbed a computer chip and then done some reverse technology  and invented that 10 years before anyone else did.  Well, that could have been done, too.  Yeah, why didn't they – well, you know, the time machine can't be used to make money. 
[00:28:30]  That's crazy.  That's a sports almanac.  Well, that was a mistake, obviously.  Marty was going to do that, was going to bring it back and make money himself.  And when Doc found out, he got very angry and very lazily threw away the sports almanac  and let Biff get it.  Silly.  Just very irresponsible.  Yeah.  Doc was very irresponsible with that time machine.  I think Marty McFly goes back in time now just to have a coffee without scalding his wrists. 
[00:29:00]  i should have gone back in time and gotten a fire extinguisher  oh well hey hey yeah they made the daily news yeah uh anthony got david hinkley decided for  once not to write about this radio station wfuv we don't even know what what is wfuv for the rest 
[00:29:30]  of america we got a guy david hinkley he's he's supposed to write about radio and i guess he  technically does yes yeah he has this on the radio column that he does almost every day in the daily  news but he writes about stuff no one gives a crap about there's like some real big you know radio  stories happening and he he avoids all that and goes for the obscure like he talks about this  station wfuv what is it it's uh fordham university's radio station what it every day yeah he's got 
[00:30:00]  comments about it in his column i don't know if he's getting a kickback or what really every day  all right except today well today he needed a little room for a little story today he's finally doing  like a real radio story he writes one of the great pleasures of radio comes right after anthony cumia  of the morning show at uh krocket xm has a bad breakup and recounts it on the air  as he explained last friday with ron and fez then again yesterday he tried to stash one girl in the 
[00:30:30]  closet when his then full-time girlfriend channel 11's jill nicolini made a surprise appearance  like stash one girl in the closet that's a story that if i read it as a radio guy i'd be all over it  oh yeah but wait he called it the morning show yeah i think because i beat him up so much he  doesn't want to yeah what happened that's okay he didn't mention the opian anthony show did he i don't  need my name in the paper no he didn't actually it's weird that's that's that's a shot because we 
[00:31:00]  anthony of the opian anthony show that's a shot because we uh we beat him up pretty good on this  show yeah we do passive aggressive there he's always talking about fuv  mm-hmm but uh yeah he well he hit that one he uh you know i didn't stash a girl in a closet though  well she went into the closet or on her own accord to get dressed get it straight  i was hoping that the door wouldn't be opened but it was 
[00:31:30]  but he throws it at the end of the art what's he doing yeah much more and then and then he has a  pig this is how dumb this david hinkley is that's a big radio story for new york that would have been  a good one i think a story i think when it comes to radio stories in new york uh the anthony jill  saga is the biggest thing going on right that's scandal intrigue sure mystery sure guns guns fire  fire fire it's got everything cool in it's like an action movie yeah so like jimmy says uh here yeah 
[00:32:00]  it's it's just uh an almost an afterthought at the end of his column a little tiny little blurb  and then they got a picture of vic latino i don't even know who vic latino is and we work in  uh he was in my uh new york radio but they have a picture of him and so that means that vic latino  is the most important story according to david hinkley and is on the radio column and the reason  they have a picture of vic latino instead of you anthony and yours is so skinless it's it's perfect  scandal is because this vic latino guy i guess is uh putting out a compilation cd today with songs 
[00:32:30]  from rihanna and madonna on it pu what is that who cares it's his like 15th cd what is it and he  programs a dance station out off exit 63 great what is it it's a it's a stupid cd of dance music  that does he remix it or is it just like just a little bit oh my god david hinkley wake up who gives  a crap no one does a picture should have been anthony's today that should have been anthony's 
[00:33:00]  picture should have been my spot together right there's plenty of those yeah jesus  wow yeah that was kind of silly but it does sound really funny like if i read that and didn't know  anything about the situation i'd be like what the hell is he up to the hell of a story and and people  tuning in every day just for the update now please tell me it's officially over i know the relationship  is but as far as the ties to jill are is it over did the hostage hostage exchange take place 
[00:33:30]  well oh uh keith my liaison uh between the two keith yeah uh was over the house yesterday supervising  some uh construction okay and um he reminded me of the situation i uh got some cash i forked it over  to him and uh apparently keith is gonna take care of the exchange when it's gonna be a pure cash for  goods exchange at this point wow it's just uh yeah when though today he'll show up and she'll go who the 
[00:34:00]  hell are you give me the money ah fargo ah loves that one with beshemi like steps out of the car  who are you i want my daughter is it going down today uh uh uh it could i i don't know now now it's  all in keith's hands well keith is pretty responsible so i would imagine yeah yeah he would get this done 
[00:34:30]  immediately for you now that you've committed to yeah i mean he's got he's got the goods yeah um now  it's just a matter of going over there and uh doing the exchange all right can we cover it uh  i would think that might be a little intrusive yeah let's say hi to bill in jersey bill oh  hey bill the uh game that you're thinking of jimmy yeah the game that you're thinking of is 
[00:35:00]  thurman actually died the day played that night was the game they came back from thurman's funeral  oh okay that's right they said that uh bobby mercer eulogized him yeah oh did i remember it right  then yeah you know the game yeah the game you're thinking of is the game that he died the game they  played the game of thurman's uh funeral state flight from canton ohio the yankees actually played  the same day that thurman died with the first game after started they charred the flight back from 
[00:35:30]  the funeral from ohio oh so at the first game back was that oakland the last one nothing  it was no the game that you're thinking of is the day that he died okay but that's what i'm saying  so the yankees played the same day thurman months and died yeah they chartered a flight from canton ohio  why would you play the same day as uh one of your star players dying yeah they have to i guess right 
[00:36:00]  well no you don't have to the game you watched last night or whenever you watched it is the day  that his funeral was that that i that is true because they said mercer uh gave the eulogy and  then won the game with the head but i think what that caller was trying to say is that the game you  remembered was from the day that he actually died okay i'm sure was that a one what i'm saying is  is my memory correct about that was that actually a one nothing loss to uh oakland i'm gonna find out 
[00:36:30]  i have not looked it up i'm obviously probably because i am that smart but you know uh we moved  on way too quickly booby man for book uh brooklyn writes construction at your house anthony what are  you building another closet building a hidden closet a hatch a secret a false wall in the back of the  closet that can be opened up with a press of a button ah nice that would be handy i might have 
[00:37:00]  to build one of those are we ever gonna know by the way and lost what the hatch was for ever gonna  know what the numbers were being the push of that stupid computer i don't know uh apparently they say  they got the storylines all spelt out everything's done all right all right yeah look how big d snyder's  head has gotten jesus like what what is he doing i don't know sitting with elton john promoting  something he's on uh seems to be on cw 11 uh twisted sister i don't know it's probably plugging some 
[00:37:30]  halloween thing oh jj french and he's plugging his hair they do everything wow what is that about jj french  has a beast on his head he sure does yeah i think they do some kind of halloween show yeah hey i  finally got a picture of uh our waiter from the park meridian it's up on onaradio.com we uh we've  been going to park meridian for years uh-huh to have like meetings and stuff with super agent bob and 
[00:38:00]  every once in a while we'll go over there and there's a waiter that's been nice to us forever  but he has this thing on his head it is the most horrendous thing we've ever seen in our lives  and he just he just goes about his life like it like there's nothing going on with his hair  yeah and we finally got a picture of it and it's up on onaradio.com i kind of feel guilty because the  guy's so nice to us but it had to be done should have blocked his face out and then just put the  hair and then not said where he worked supposed to all this a little late a little late good point 
[00:38:30]  but uh the uh yeah i had a little uh run in with somebody at the parker uh now i stay there a lot  um you know it's kind of my home away from home when i'm here in manhattan and i well it is i know  but uh when obama was staying there everyone knew it uh the security there was there was a police one 
[00:39:00]  of those um mobile outposts that they wheel around and and uh cops all over the place everyone knew  obama was staying there so we talked about it on the radio show because kenny came in and said yeah  obama's staying across the street so uh we talked about it on the air one of the guys from the park  walks up to me and goes you know uh mr cumia we don't appreciate you uh giving out any information  on guests that are staying at our hotel i just want to let you know so that there's no problem in

[00:40:00]  room maybe we'll get that story out someday we'll but no you should definitely bring it up with  somebody man i know you're you're a very good customer i am i'm a preferred guest and what's  funny about that story like and said you it was obvious that obama was everyone knew it was so  obvious yeah they weren't like keeping it on the qt people saw him coming and going and the paper  would report it yeah and the news would report it yeah so it's not like you saw some guy in the  hallway and then set it on the air so this guy was at the parker just basically threatened you and 
[00:40:30]  said that you can't get a room if you talk about the fact that a guy who might be the president was  staying there on a radio show yeah meanwhile you know george bush is in town and where does he stay  the parker the no the waldorf stays at the waldorf everyone knows that what am i gonna get yelled at  for uh for that too was he in town today and then i'm a digit rod i'm a digit but i'm a big head guy  from iran or a guy who hates our country man he enjoys the uh loves he enjoys the pleasures of

[00:42:30]  fans like motley crew ted nugent deep purple the cars journey alice cooper stevie rayvon neil diamond  ozzy osbourne and kiss not in the rock and roll hall of fame ridiculous this year the nominees are  metallica that's a no-brainer right then you got the stooges  what the stooges as in iggy and the stooges yeah because look if you're really into music

[00:43:30]  i could not name one stooges uh song and i'm proud to say that by the way and i know a lot about uh  music a lot this is uh too cool for the room uh crap that they voted in well yeah yeah because  they want to be too cool they're all like look at what i voted for man and now people are going to  come out of the woodwork i know they were influential and all i know all that stuff but  still shut it just shut your mouth the same mentality as rolling stone magazine which always 
[00:44:00]  sucked the magazine sucked if you're a metal fan sucked i enjoyed uh rolling stone over the  earth stunk jackson brown i really had fruity music it was terrible i really enjoyed how their  articles went on and on and on and on and on right how much can you write about it in small font and  it you know it's five pages and then the article would continue on page 78 then you go to page 78  and it goes from 78 to 82 and then after 82 it goes well this article continues on page 128 you go 
[00:44:30]  to 128 it goes for half a page and then cover and then it goes well now go back to page two because  we finished the article on page two and then you have to go into the classifieds to find the ending  of this they're ridiculous horrible what you get your no no i say this is only nominations to this  does not mean they're going in no no oh they have to fight it out or something like a battle royale  yeah they voted on oh all right so here are the here are the uh bands they're going to be voting on  this year metallica the stooges jeff effing beck jeff effing beck what what has this guy done in

[00:46:30]  really and uh he wasn't uh nominated no i'm not the biggest of bon jovi fan but you you gotta admit  the guy has had some longevity in the business you can't argue about his success yeah the guy  saying i like that wanted dead or alive though you know uh you know wanted dead or alive i'm more  living on a prayer kind of guy dude i gotta tell you i was at a wedding in scranton with the philly  crew sorry and they yeah thank you it was a good time scream but it was scranton and it's all about 
[00:47:00]  the office up there yeah because done done yeah exactly it's everywhere because that's a claim to  fame up there but i was at a wedding and and the dj was trying to get something going in the room  and the philly crew they don't need anyone to get anything going for them but the dj was trying  bartender yeah uh what i said you said they don't need anyone to get anything going oh except the  bartender yeah philly crew likes their their bruce uh so the dj's playing uh living on a prayer that's 
[00:47:30]  why i'm laughing and you know the part where it goes oh yeah he he goes everybody he turns the song  completely off as as it's cranking in the in the hall and everyone's into it hoping the whole crowd  was gonna do their sing-along yeah it was that's great but it should have been it this guy bombed so bad  and being a dj oh is that good he was waiting for that moment where everybody the old people the 
[00:48:00]  young people the bride and groom all we're gonna be handing out the uh shades no no shade and uh  you're gonna be singing uh that uh bob seger song yeah no old time rock and roll no they didn't go  there no god we're gonna hand out the blow-up guitars and uh everyone's gonna do a little air  guitar lead all right now everybody roll up roll up your uh pant leg yeah so we could do a 
[00:48:30]  a kick line weddings just you're describing your brother's wedding you know that yeah your brother  had that of course he did one of those very very very very rare kumia weddings yes yes extremely  uh rare in your family just got it just got worse from there that that wedding the marriage uh no  heart is not in the rock and roll hall of fame another band that's been very influential they 
[00:49:00]  are but not a huge heart fan but come on you know crazy on you a little magic man it doesn't hurt  anybody to hear that every once in a while how is kiss not even nominated it's so stupid so then you  got wanda jackson we don't know crap about we do we do what do we know about wanda jackson we uh just  checked her out she's not gospel she was considered the first lady of rock and roll  what back in the 50s i'd never uh heard her before but maybe she's the oldie nomination  she went country later did she they all go country to save their careers that's what that 
[00:49:30]  this is the rock and roll hall of fame nominee  does sound like a little gospel he's smiling down on us he's talking about jesus  does he he knows how hard we're trying does he give us all his love as he pushes a boulder off  the side of a mountain and makes it careen into a bus full of church goers is that all his love 
[00:50:00]  i beg to differ  all his love as he has a child come out of a womb that has three arms and no nose and suffocates  right there on the delivery table is that all his love with anthony i don't think god give all his  love i don't think he's giving all his love i i do believe god tries but he doesn't give all his love  not all his love he misses a a few couple of times people aren't getting all his love if you 
[00:50:30]  were getting all of jesus's love yeah you'd be set yeah there's been some horrific people that have  walked this earth that didn't get uh yeah god's love i don't think someone like let's go john  benet ramsey was getting all of jesus's love as she was being choked to death oh i don't think that  was all jesus what about the latest uh baby killer i forget her oh yeah yeah what's her  name uh katie or whatever yeah whatever had no problem doing something with her baby and just 
[00:51:00]  going about her life like nothing changed i don't think lacy peterson got all of jesus's love  as her lifeless body and the lifeless body of her unborn child was thrown into the ocean  i think jesus was looking away he was giving all his love to someone else that day you think susan  smith was playing wanda jackson as she was like back in that car into the lake my kids all their love  hey mommy that was all my glove glove glove glove glove glove yeah he's not shining down on 
[00:51:30]  everyone i don't think he's shining down no no no yeah there you go i don't think jesus was giving  me all his love when uh that closet door opened no he could have influenced that he's jesus he was  just showing his sense of humor he could have jammed up the door jesus can act as a doorstop  where were you jesus in my time of me who are you i saw one single set of footprints and they 
[00:52:00]  were jills going toward the closet why did you abandon me jesus in my hardest time there were one  set of footprints he said it was those times son i was standing on the balcony laughing at you  as i look back at the hardest times of my life i see one set of footprints and they're all staggering  footprints it must have been danny downstairs going sideways into the bathroom puddle of warm liquid 
[00:52:30]  some vomit i don't know uh let's get through this crap he gives us all his love yeah thanks uh  listen to jackson right sounds like jackson no listen to uh william wanda jackson wanda jackson  listen to williams listen to williams has that same type of style but she's a new broad  we're a new yeah a newer broad uh compared to wanda jackson yeah wanda goes back to the fitties 
[00:53:00]  i'm just going obscure for a few people out there anthony sure hey uh then you got little anthony and  the imperials oh i don't mind these old groups going in like they got to go back and grab them  you gotta grab one or two yeah i mean they kind of started a lot of it grab them by their toupees and  drag them into the rock and roll hall of fame and little anthony little anthony and the imperials  like something maybe from uh your neighborhood i bet it was really i don't know do want music is  it do up i think it is what do you got on that here we go yeah yeah do do do

[00:54:00]  how we make believe it was an innocent time and there was no finger popping going on back there  shut up an innocent time when they were fire hosing negroes right and uh yeah and everyone  was suspected of being a commie yeah what innocent great times the good old days they called it women  don't vote i love when the news back to a time of innocence yes innocence when we all were wondering 
[00:54:30]  when the hydrogen bomb was coming from russia like no one was getting in and getting it in the  fart box during the innocent time of course they were you had to send them off though to the uh  convent yeah once they found out they were uh they had a bad reputation didn't call them sluts  back then she has a bad rep and you knew you could get a little off of her maybe a little reef of  madness you gotta think that there were size queens back in the innocent time period oh hell yeah

[01:04:00]  i used to love it  oh i used to love it  homer doesn't like him no he doesn't  i guess he was influential to someone yeah whatever and then finally this is this is the  one well run dmc and then you got uh reverend run yeah but you know they did the they did the  rock rep thing yeah one song that they collaborated with aerosmith uh on and and that puts him in the 
[01:04:30]  rock and roll hall of fame well technically rock box had like guitar in it too they i'll say run dmc  was of all the very really all right jim influential crossover stuff i kind of liked uh  run dmc when i was uh growing up yeah yeah they're a rap group by what else they're like  christmas yeah i'm kind of drinking myself all right and then you got uh this is the one that should  drive jimmy crazy the most uh chic what 
[01:05:00]  freak out yep that's who they nominate over kiss or rush now that is a one hit wonder wonder disco  era band stunt brain what was the second song chic did well it's not about chic's hits i think  it's about nile rogers did a song called it's not about oh nile rogers so why didn't they just  nominate him secondly you know songwriter producer he's been on a hundred hits but  oh freak out just stuff but not chic jeff beck yeah the play shocked me listen to ace play it was much

[01:06:00]  where have you been billy boy billy boy where have you been starling  i've been down to the farm didn't do no harm can you make a cherry pie darling billy  purple  oh with his dirty fingers all over the harmonica  wow  oh what a dope 
[01:06:30]  he was  i know  where have you been billy boy hopefully in front of a bus  where have you been starling billy  i have been down to the farm and i didn't do no harm  can you make a cherry pie  with the pigs who are smarter than you  billy boy that was pretty good  that was pretty good i look i like your version better by the way and 
[01:07:00]  it's been singing that song for years god billy boy billy boy  mickey rooney is 88 years young mickey rooney of course the star of the movie uh bill  yeah uh where that song came from he was singing with uh dennis quaid  who played the young uh uh filmmaker hoping to capture  retarded bill in his documentary which he did  then they made don't confuse it with bill on his own  because that sucked  yeah  the original is just called bill and it is a scream a hoot 
[01:07:30]  anthony turned me on to this movie years ago and it's one of those  movies that's not supposed to be funny but is hilarious to us  all i remember is sitting on the cat when it first came out  i'm sitting on the couch with my girlfriend at the time i'll never forget that little lisa  lisa messina yeah in smithtown and uh we're sitting there and i am  crying laughing so hard and she's punching me for laughing at the retard uh unbelievable 
[01:08:00]  it was so goddamn funny though there was no not laughing at this  oh boy oh chicken oh he gets  dennis quaid invites bill over to his parents house he befriended the old he befriended the guy  as he's making this documentary he just started out to make a documentary and then he realized  that he was going to befriend him and he also realized that he probably shouldn't have been 
[01:08:30]  institutionalized when he was a kid and he spent all these years in an institution he's an old man now  and that's what made him really retarded was no interaction with you know normal people  uh but he was completely out of his mind retarded so he comes over the uh the house he  dennis quaid brings him over and he's got these hoity-toity parents that live in like  connecticut and stuff like greenwich or something yeah yeah and he brings them over and they're like oh  hello bill the mother's all condescending the father just doesn't want to hear it he just wants 
[01:09:00]  to go play he's like why aren't you you know getting into the family business and stuff like  that he's all uh pissed at him for being a filmmaker and then uh they're having chicken  so the mother brings out or actually i think the maid or something brought out this giant platter of  chicken which sits down and bill just goes oh boy chicken and takes his hands which you know have been  down his pants up his nose down the back of his pants and just starts grabbing all the chicken from  the platter and putting it on his plate and dennis quaid is going no bill that's enough and bill's 
[01:09:30]  not even listening he's just going oh bill loves chicken and they show his snotty fingers all over  the chicken and then and then uh dennis quaid yelled at him put that back bill and bill went oh and  got up and went into the corner and started crying where dennis quaid should have started punching him  in the face we just taped him in the area say they're stupid while we eat dummy now we've done the  bit uh movies that weren't supposed to be funny that are hysterical we have done that right maybe 
[01:10:00]  we could do that after the break some other movies that weren't supposed to be funny oh my god but we  are we've argued the about schmidt thing because i thought that was hilarious yeah and other people  are saying it was kind of supposed to be funny really but i was like i didn't know we were laughing  at i was laughing with the the vacuum cleaner vacuum cleaner with the skew shoe yeah i was laughing just  because at every turn everything goes wrong for jack nixon's character and he's telling all this 
[01:10:30]  stuff to a kid named nabutu or whatever he's writing a letter to right right about his wife  and he hates her scent i mean it was a dark comedy i love the movie i love it all right maybe we could  come up with a couple other movies that weren't supposed to be funny that are hilarious i make coffee at  the school that's what they got him a job doing because because then his buddy barry yeah his  buddy had to uh move to get a better job and they had to leave bill uh you know like two thousand miles 
[01:11:00]  away so they got him a job making coffee at wild bill's coffee shop uh in the school they made a big  kind of big opening and there was bill making coffee making his snotty finger coffee was he wild bill he  was wild bill oh was he wild he actually is because he probably throws the hot liquid all willy-nilly  probably bites people i'm a dumb bill's dumb bill's coffee toilet 
[01:11:30]  oh boy and then oh another favorite is when he's trying to call barry uh and he goes he calls the  operator and she goes number please and he goes uh three five three two nine seven six four three  twenty five seven the wheels fall off nine he just kept and she's like that's too many numbers  no okay six five three two nine seven three six five eighty two eight nine 
[01:12:00]  yeah it's like boss barry just wants to bang his wife without that moron voice on the phone dummy  always calling for help we had dennis quaid on the show my doctor kicked me in the guts  talk about how the doctors at the hospital abused him and i was hysterical  and then they pushed me down the stairs we had the great dummy we had the great dennis quaid on our  show a year or so ago and uh he was promoting something we could have talked about anything 
[01:12:30]  with the guy we refused to talk about anything but this will be bill he was laughing hard though  because i started going bury my body my body and he started cracking up like who remembers this piece  of crap that was supposed to be like a movie that just goes it's really hard to find yeah is it  it's uh it's a movie that's really hard to find you've never seen it i have yes sure okay  bill for short i remember bill for short my name is uh william bill for short didn't he say i'm bill 
[01:13:00]  yeah i'm bill for shorter and you went to grab and go it's the same name adult no we have to take  a break yes we do uh so mickey rooney whatever happy birthday wild bill you got jason alexander 49  today and you got bruce springsteen we should roll insane springsteen for springsteen's birthday  hopefully hope so let's get that done before we get out of here uh springsteen 59 today  it's the opian anthony show 
[01:13:30]  i just got a google alert that's  oh god the google i call the google i know we try not to go down this road as much as we used to but  this stupid citadel and uh parade  he used to be our friend and then uh something happened and he took us off all of his radio  stations because he can't afford us and we were pretty damn cheap and and we're not sitting here 
[01:14:00]  crying uh poverty i i want to make that perfectly clear but it was ridiculous what he did to us in  this radio show and we loved uh being on in buffalo and uh we're we're now replaced uh officially  by uh bull and he's going to be doing a lot of local content and uh a lot of music and a lot of  bills coverage so i guess that'll get the job done for farid and and this dumb radio company of his 
[01:14:30]  that's the answer to everything these days is uh uh the executive saying hey local content that'll  do it that'll get it done will it mm-hmm yeah whatever all right and i pay attention because i'm psychotic  since we've been off uh buffalo the ratings drastically dropped last month and i mean drastically  so another great move by uh by our old pal farid we were doing good let's say how to adam in south  dakota adam yo i can't believe how awful jeffrey was on dancing with the stars last night i don't 
[01:15:00]  care if he was one-eyed and that polyester outfit but the fattest man in polyester good job tv show  you know what you're you're uh you're absolutely right adam um i had to watch this dance with the  stars last night because our pals on it jeffrey ross he's been on our show a million times we all know  yeah seven years my wife's been watching it the first person that interests me in the slightest  and he's got one eye and he's awful he has to be awful he's a comic he's not gonna be a good dancer 
[01:15:30]  i am uh i imagine a lot of on a people had to check out dance with the stars for jeffrey ross i've  never seen this show now i haven't even seen a highlight i refuse no and i'm like all right jeffrey  ross is uh on i gotta watch and i i had to keep going between the jets game and dance with  the stars and they put them on late in the show so i'm stuck watching some of these these dance  routines like who would watch this crap for real who cares but then i'll be the the geriatric 
[01:16:00]  old woman did better than he did uh cloris leachman yes she's 82 and uh she was i gotta be yeah fair  she was hilarious last night yeah she's wearing this thing with her cleavage her 82 year old  big boob cleavage showing yes i'm imagining they have to be implants or something because  an 82 year old broad showing off cleavage like that and almost getting the job done  almost was a little weird and then if her gut wouldn't have stuck out farther than her breast 
[01:16:30]  she's been fine and she uh she cursed three or four times and uh the audio went dead but on the last  one she got the s word out oh yeah i wonder if there's gonna be some controversy because you know  dancing with the stars it's a it's a pretty big show and they're and they got an old broad saying the  s word she's got a pretty big show too but i don't think even the ona fans can save them  punching out if we got an if if an s uh word slipped through we would be fired yep but dancing with the  stars it slipped through it happens nothing will happen with cloris leachman or that show radio is 
[01:17:00]  holy hold the holy land for some reason are we supposed to vote for jeffrey ross try to help him  and keep him on this uh dance with the stars yeah in a way i want him to go away so i don't have to  watch this every week we should but he's dead last right now he scored 12 points 12 points he was  what out of like out of 30 is it though i don't even know really i guess they go from one to ten or  something he got poked in the eye uh at rehearsal and had to go to the hospital so his eye was all  messed up who poked him scratch cornea the the hot bra that was on our couch whatever her name 
[01:17:30]  was she just poked him in the eye to get out of uh having a dance with him i'm trying to lean in for a  kiss for a real moment i want to get him on the show because what they're doing with this  is they're showing the first meeting you got the the real dancer and the and the celebrity whatever  and they meet for the first time and then they show them live last night doing their dance thing  and what you notice is everyone lost a tremendous amount of weight except for jeffrey ross he's the  only guy that i think gained weight dancing 12 hours a day or whatever the hell they're doing 
[01:18:00]  tonight is your first chance to see our stars as they unveil their inaugural routines earlier today  jeffrey ross was injured when he was uh accidentally poked in the eye during rehearsal he was rushed to  the hospital doctors said he has a scratch cornea they advised him not to dance but in the spirit  of a true entertainer or just a reckless human being he decided the show must go on it's stand-up  comedian jeffrey ross and his partner edita slavinska scratch cornea huh scratch cornea yeah 
[01:18:30]  and uh and you know you haven't totally made it when they have to say stand-up comedian first  yeah you know yeah you don't hear like you know an actress phyllis we know she is yeah floris leachman  you know you know god bless jeffrey ross it's a great hit for him for his career but it's such a weird  weird like it's just a weird thing to have him involved in why would they pick jeffrey ross yeah 
[01:19:00]  unless they're doing like the wacky factor this is the judges after he danced let's see what the  judges have to say carry and let's start with you come on baby well the the flirting was good  and uh the it's hard because you're i know you injured yourself and i've had that injury and it's  very very painful so i admire you for getting out there it's difficult to look at the lights but  the form was bad the musicality was off and i just didn't feel like you're having a great time i mean  to that song you gotta get into it yeah okay good job all right bruno jeff i haven't seen such an 
[01:19:30]  ungainly carnage since clover feeling 3d he's just you know nothing really worked the begging at the end  that was good and by the way i think jimmy pointed this out last week or the week before  every show has to have the english douche yes just like ugh the proper english douche douche joke  yeah that has to be over critical yeah because people have this vibe that british people aren't  hokey or stupid and they are why does every one of these shows have to have the english person 
[01:20:00]  len honestly i respect your opinion the most because you're a legend you've been judging dancing with  the stars since it was a radio show let me have it what i'll say is this i think everyone that comes  on to dancing with the stars is a winner because of the commitment that well done jeff thank you 
[01:20:30]  there you go nicely said shut up can anyone explain why this show is pretty much the hottest show in  america yeah middle america i i because because of ross i watched a little bit i'm like okay what's  the appeal here why would you watch this i think chicks watch it it's got to be just all chicks yeah  yeah oh and then they had one of those moments that we talked about last week uh one of the dancers  is so like there's no effing way he's not and they kind of had like a comment like wow look how lucky 
[01:21:00]  you are because you're dancing with and i forgot her i think it was uh uh brooke that that model  brooke uh help me out here somebody please i don't i don't watch it so much that i have no clue  spokesperson she was on mtv brooke uh burns brooke what hogan shields huh brooke brooke  bird thank you and and the backstage judge looked at the dancer that has to be like oh you are look 
[01:21:30]  you are so lucky that you get to be with brooke and i'm like oh are you are you insane so uh baby  you and brooke settle down for a little while uh you never know what's gonna happen perhaps uh wedding  bells well i don't think so regis um i really don't think she's not really my type not your type she's  gorgeous look at that nice supple breasts yeah i don't really like those what are you crazy 
[01:22:00]  just a little little spend a little time together i'm sure once you get to know each other better  you'll fall in love and get married like gelman  another fruit yeah it was one of those moments oh god regis is the worst for that i know it's just  so obvious like just leave the stupid dancer alone yes it's obvious he's not into what you're 
[01:22:30]  claiming so when did you start dancing right well i've always danced ever since i was a small child  small child i bet that got a lot of the girls right you know it how to dance yeah whatever  stupid regis can't can't see a gay man when he looks one right in the eye it's like  regis get gay glasses or something he needs gaydar right and then finally this i feel uh you know i 
[01:23:00]  don't know i i wish i didn't get hurt you know but the doctor said not to dance i was born to dance  i'll go blind dancing if i have to my one thing is that i can only see out of one eye i can only see  half of kim kardashian's booty there'll be more chances potentially for that let's get your scores  jeffrey and edit up the judges have their scores carrie ann in arbor four yeah  len goodman four yeah bruno tomioli fall 12 but you don't seem to have spirit stamper no i feel 
[01:23:30]  really good where do you see my rossa nova i think jeffrey's uh done i think our pal's  going to be voted off tonight i think they vote off tonight right and then i'll be done with this  show two more nights two more nights so he'll have three nights at least on the show how could you do  worse yeah all right she's right stood there this is jeff uh let's say hi to john in boston listening 
[01:24:00]  on bcn john good morning bubba boys hi hey hey uh the reason that the show does so well is middle-aged  dads my father loves this show because of the sequins and the cleavage loves the chicks on the show  the chicks are hot you can't deny it just look at porn though who cares about sequins yeah this day  in age you could go anywhere to right you know hot pics but the cuckolded dads and stuff like  that that can't get the access to the porn and you just got to get it on with the wives afterwards 
[01:24:30]  they dig this stuff it's like they're safe porn i don't know man all right you might i don't know  it's not the tony orlando and dawn special it's like yeah that 1978 all right let's go to jared  jared with the sandwiches uh i have an observation anthony your uh your gay dancer sounds an awful lot  like uh mondo topless when i'm doing the tablets doing the tablets you know it's a thing when i'm doing 
[01:25:00]  the tablets it makes me feel so free there's just something about the tablets  oh should we or should we not i know right we we could do that we get yelled at by uh the hardcore  yeah yeah i know enough about the mondo topless right hey we got roland singing uh some bruce

[01:37:30]  The big high one here.  Boo.  Ha ha ha.  I didn't hit no time.  Boo.  Ha ha ha.  Boo.  Happy birthday, Bruce.  59 years old.  I got to reprimand an instant feedback.  Chris C. from Virginia, no, that was not the Travis Barker tribute. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  O.P. and Anthony.  Having a good one today.  O.P. and Anthony.  We got to go right to the phone.  We got Peyton Manning calling in today.  Ooh.  Look at us getting a little respect.  Slow down.  I'm sure we'll blow it.  Mr. Manning. 
[01:38:30]  Mr. Manning.  Peyton.  Mr. Peyton Manning.  Hmm.  Mr. My brother won the Super Bowl last year.  Ha ha ha.  Hello.  Hello.  Uh.  Hello.  Yep.  Mr. Manning.  It'd be funny if he's playing a silent game.  All right.  Mr. Manning.  Peyton.  Hello.  Do you have something in the background? 
[01:39:00]  I like your commercials.  Mr. Manning.  Can you hear me?  Oh, I heard that.  Wait.  I think we might have a contact.  Peyton Manning.  I'm here, guys.  How you doing?  There he is.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  How are you, sir?  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for having me.  Doing okay.  I hear you're promoting DirecTV or something.  Well, that's what I'm doing today, obviously.  Eli did this a couple months ago.  Who?  Who?  I don't acknowledge Eli because I'm a Jets fan, sir. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, is that right?  Well.  I'm not into the big blue thing.  I'm not a big blue guy.  Well, it's.  And I'm.  But I'm also an honest guy.  I don't think Brett Favre is going to get the job done for the Jets like everyone thinks  here in New York.  Well, it's still early.  At least that's what I'm sticking with right now.  Both Jets and the Colts, both one and two, still love the ball to be played.  Peyton, you don't have to be nice.  You could trash the Jets.  You could trash Brett Favre.  We all know he's going to go into the Hall of Fame as a Packer, and this is just kind 
[01:40:00]  of like wasting time.  I don't know.  It's still early.  It's still early.  I like you.  Very diplomatic, Peyton.  Well, that's why, you know, everyone loves him.  We could learn something from Peyton Manning.  Yeah.  Be diplomatic and lovable instead of insufferable.  Ass like you are.  All right.  Let's try another tact here, Peyton.  Tom Brady.  This year, in general.  Well, Tom Brady, do you feel bad for the guy? 
[01:40:30]  I mean, he had a, you know, obviously he loses the Super Bowl in that just amazing game that  your brother, you know, had.  And you've got to think, well, you're a quarterback, so let's ask you.  Now you're sitting out the whole offseason.  All you want to do is get back on that field and erase that nightmare that happened to you,  right?  And then you go down and you don't even get to play.  He's got to be going out of his mind.  Well, it's certainly disappointing for me to see any quarterback get injured.  But Tom's a friend of mine. 
[01:41:00]  I know how hard Tom works every offseason.  So to get hurt in the first game of the season, as a matter of fact, I can't even watch the  video when they show it.  You know, the TV stations will kind of tease the injury coming up.  And it's just one of those things you want to see.  As a quarterback, you certainly know what that's like.  Guys falling around your feet.  So I know Tom will rehab and be back in half the time, they say.  But as a quarterback, it's kind of a unique fraternity, believe it or not.  Obviously, when you're playing against a guy, you hope he doesn't have a great day. 
[01:41:30]  Maybe you're not pulling for him on that day.  But overall, you hate to see a fellow quarterback get booed, get pulled out of a game, or get injured.  But Peyton, us fans don't want to think that you guys actually get along.  You're in the same division.  We like to think that you guys hate each other.  Well, it certainly is competitive.  Don't get me wrong.  Obviously, you're doing whatever you've got to do to help your team win.  But I think somebody's got to kind of stick together as a quarterback, Ernie, because 
[01:42:00]  it's a pretty unique group.  In fact, you're dealing with a lot of other things that other positions and other people  in sports aren't dealing with.  You're dealing with a lot of pressure.  And so there is somewhat of a fraternity.  The guys do kind of pull for each other and stick together.  And especially when it comes to injuries, it's something that you hate to see.  Well, Peyton, it's Jim Norton.  Basically, you guys bond because you're the guy on the field that everybody wants to kill.  I mean, you're the focus of every play is that they want to, you know, the whole other  team is trying to attack you. 
[01:42:30]  That's probably where your bond comes from is you guys are the targets.  Absolutely.  It's a unique position to be in.  Obviously, you have your hands on the football every single play.  In fact, they always say three things can happen when you throw the ball and two of them  are bad.  Can you explain something to Boston today?  There's a story.  A lot of people are mad because Brady wasn't watching the game this past weekend and he  was shopping with his kid.  And a lot of people are saying, well, even though he's injured, he should be supporting the team 
[01:43:00]  and showing that he cares and he should have been in front of a big screen TV somewhere.  Flat screen.  Yeah, I certainly haven't heard that.  Believe me, we have plenty of problems right here in Indianapolis.  We're trying to deal with right now, trying to get out of this one and two record.  So it's hard for me to comment on that.  It's still early.  It's still early.  Do you think the fans sometimes, though, like, because the guy, Brady's hurt.  He's obviously, nobody wants to watch.  It's probably depressing to watch the game when you know you should be in. 
[01:43:30]  But do you think the fans sometimes just kind of, like, overrate it, like, expect you to  be as into it as they are?  When you're hurt, you just want to kind of get away and do your own thing?  Well, hopefully it's something I really haven't had to deal with in the regular season.  I was injured some this preseason, which is different.  But a knock on wood, hopefully I can keep it that way and always be playing.  But I know it's a tough time for guys that are hurt because you want to be out there playing.  And it's just a different experience to deal with of not being out there, 
[01:44:00]  being on the field with your teammates.  All right.  Hey, make believe the Colts don't play in the NFL for this next question.  Who wins the Super Bowl this year?  Peyton Manning.  Make believe the Colts don't play.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, who would you say?  If not picking the Colts, who would you pick?  Yeah, because you would obviously have to pick the Colts if we ask that question.  So we make believe you're not in the NFL.  Who wins this year?  Well, you've got at age 32 as much as I used to be, maybe when I was like seven. 
[01:44:30]  So I sort of deal in the reality.  And hopefully the Colts can get on a little hot streak right now.  But it's kind of all the teams that you think.  I still think in the AFC, it's a lot of those.  It's Pittsburgh.  It's New England.  It's San Diego.  Of course, Denver's playing great.  Buffalo's playing great.  I mean, I know I've been saying it the whole time, but it is early.  And I think that's what's great is that every fan right now thinks their team has a chance.  Right.  And I believe it.  You know, unlike basketball or baseball, where teams can kind of separate themselves early 
[01:45:00]  and sort of run away with it in football, it's sort of anybody's game every single Sunday.  So it's going to be competitive, both NFC and AFC.  It used to be so one-sided AFC.  And now, you know, with the Giants back and the Cowboys back and the Packers, it's really up for anybody's grabs.  Yeah, Packers doing all right without Brett Favre.  And a lot of people picking the Cowboys this year.  Yep.  And you said you feel bad for, like, a quarterback when he gets hurt or something.  You definitely empathize. 
[01:45:30]  Can you think, like, what's the worst you've ever felt for another player?  Whether you were playing or not, just watching a guy either make, just say not even injury-related,  but just an on-field make an ass out of himself or a blunder.  Like, for me, it was probably watching Leon Lett kick the football against Miami when he slid in the snow  and he kicked the ball and gave them possession in that Thanksgiving game.  I remember that one.  That was quite a play by Leon that day. 
[01:46:00]  Certainly you have games, sure, where you feel bad, whether it's a teammate that maybe dropped a wide-open touchdown pass.  I've had plenty of those games, believe me, where the ball is just not going where I want it to go.  And as a quarterback, you feel pretty alone out there.  You know, you sort of sit down on the bench and your receivers and linemen sort of just gradually separate from you  and the cameras are zoomed right there on you.  So that's why you play the game.  You play the game knowing you might have a great game, you could have a tough game.  It's kind of how you respond to it.  So those are not games that you want to have, that's for sure. 
[01:46:30]  Do you guys want to kill the kicker when he misses?  I always wonder, like, you guys always show camaraderie as teammates.  But when he misses the extra point or he just shanks a field goal, do you guys really want to kill him?  Well, I tell you, we have kind of a unique kicker in Vinatieri in that he's truly a football player.  He hangs out with the linemen, drinks beer with the quarterbacks and the receivers.  I mean, he's truly one of the guys.  And he's made so many big kicks in his career that if he misses one, you sort of let it slide 
[01:47:00]  because you know it's not going to happen again.  So he's earned that reputation.  Yeah, you don't have one of those soccer fruits kicking the ball for you.  They don't even know what the game's all about.  They just go out there and kick field goals.  Hey, DirecTV there, Peyton.  What are we pushing today?  Well, I tell you what we're doing right now this season, we have a contest that DirecTV is sponsoring  called Ultimate Displaced Fan Search.  And we're looking for the most ravenous, craziest, diehard fan who doesn't live in the city of his favorite team. 
[01:47:30]  He's got to be 100 miles out.  They can send in an essay, a video, a blog as to why they're the most diehard fan of the New York Giants  if they live in Chicago or of the Bears if they live in Philadelphia, whatever it may be.  And so they can send it in to DisplacedFanSearch.com.  I know there's a lot of fans out there.  I know we see a lot of Colts fans when we play in other places.  We see a lot of Packer fans when the Packers come here to Indianapolis.  And so we're looking for those diehard fans who live outside their city. 
[01:48:00]  Send in your essays, your blogs, and tell us why you're the best fan.  All right, very good.  What can they win?  Yeah, what can they win there, Pete?  They can win two tickets to the Super Bowl down in Tampa.  They can meet a player on their favorite team, and they can meet your not-so-favorite quarterback, Eli.  It's funny, as a Dallas fan, I'm a Dallas fan, so I don't like the Giants.  But I was really happy.  I don't know why I wanted to see the Giants win because they're rivals.  But it was just so nice to see people in Boston that upset about something. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, I don't know.  That's how you look at it, Jimmy, because I was pretty depressed that the Pats lost that Super Bowl.  I really am.  But, you know, in all fairness, Eli Payton, man, this town was killing him early on in his career,  just destroying him, saying he can't get the job done.  And look what he turns around and does.  I was real proud of the way Eli's handled his whole career.  He's been very humble.  He's taken responsibility, and he's just been very even-keeled the whole time, 
[01:49:00]  which I think is a good attitude in that market.  It's served him well, and he's off to a great start again this year.  I'm real proud of him.  Now, if you and your brother are in the Super Bowl, right, who is Archie going to root for in the end?  Everyone wants to know.  He's the baby in the family.  They'll pull for him.  We all...  Really?  That's a real answer?  That's funny, man.  And the press and I, Indianapolis, man, they're not as bad as they are here, right?  They're probably a little easier to deal with here, because they really are kind of despicable in New York.  Well, certainly in New York, it's a different market. 
[01:49:30]  There's so many more outlets, and it's a bigger place, a lot bigger fans.  And athletes that go there know what they're getting into, and I think it's all about how you handle it.  It's being accountable when you don't play your best, and it's, like I said, not getting too high after a great game  and just sort of keeping that even-keeled attitude.  I think that's really served Eli well.  It's served, you know, Derek Jeter well, Phil Simms, whoever it may be.  And it's important to be able to handle that.  All right.  So we've got DirecTV.com. 
[01:50:00]  You can go to the NFL Sunday ticket page, and there's a link for Ultimate Displaced Fan Search.  And it's a trip for two to the Super Bowl in Tampa.  But they have to...  What did you say they have to do?  A video or photos or a blog?  Like, some type of submission that shows why they're the ultimate displaced fan of a team  that they live at least 100 miles away from the city of.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And so it's going to be a contest, and just sort of see who gives us the best reasons  why they're the most displaced, crazy, die-hard fans.  So it ought to be a fun contest. 
[01:50:30]  It goes up until November.  Okay.  Hey, Peyton, I'm feeling like you and I could be friends.  You want my number?  Yeah.  Send me your cell after this interview's over.  You know, just text me.  Seriously?  Yeah.  This guy is just a politician right to the end.  Yeah, he's a nice guy.  No, Peyton, right on, man.  Thank you so much for calling our show.  Hey, guys.  Thanks for having me.  All right.  Good luck.  Peyton Manning, everyone.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, you get two tickets to the Super Bowl.  I mean, it sucks if your team's not in it, but it doesn't suck. 
[01:51:00]  I can't say it sucks.  It's just not as good if your team's not in it.  How do we not get Tom Brady or Brett Favre or Eli Manning?  Those are teams that are key to, like, our radio show.  But we get Peyton Manning.  Well, it's not a bad thing, but I'm just saying, though.  Well, it is nice to have him on the phone and it's exciting radio that you could just  sit there and listen to.  Well, it's still early.  That was so funny.  It's just like, well, some people are like, yeah, that's why he's playing football and 
[01:51:30]  not on the air.  But some people say that he was hilarious on SNL.  Looking for a displaced fan.  And then Jimmy's got to go, what do they win?  Oh, yeah, tickets.  Yeah.  He doesn't even want to do what he's doing.  I know.  We could have got away with that one easy.  He's smart, though, because he's a spokesman, so he doesn't crap talk.  He's not a dope.  The guy talks, he's a sprint, and he's probably making millions.  Yeah.  I'd be polite, too, if I had millions on the line. 
[01:52:00]  That's why they don't have defensive linemen on the phone.  Yeah, of course not.  You know, Madison.  Oh, man, I'll bite his mama's face.  You know what, though?  Madison Avenue loves this guy.  Oh, hell yeah.  He's got the Oreo commercial.  What else?  What are some of those other commercials that he got?  With the Williamson.  Oreo cookie commercial's good.  How's he doing, Gail?  All the kind of cookies they got.  Nilla wafers.  McDonald's.  Nutter bun. 
[01:52:30]  Nutter bun.  Famous.  Famous.  Famous.  Malamore.  Malamore.  All right.  Should we take another break?  Four newtons.  Very newtons.  They taste pretty good.  Yeah.  Those famous famous cookies are pretty damn good.  Oh, before break, we could squeeze this in.  We started the show by talking about David Blaine. 
[01:53:00]  Said it earlier, I'm embarrassed to be a New Yorker.  The Mets are crashing again?  Is that why you're embarrassed?  You know, I'm being quiet about that whole thing.  I don't want anything to do with that Mets collapse this year, because I was bragging last year and all hell broke loose.  I'm keeping quiet on this one.  You just would think it would kind of be nice to have a little postseason action at Shea Stadium, but da, da.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy. 
[01:53:30]  I don't know.  They got one game ahead of the Brewers right now for the wild card.  Now we're hoping wild card.  Yeah, so if they lose.  A mere 12 days ago, we were thinking we're going to win the division.  If they lose and the Brewers win, there goes that game.  I just wanted to introduce myself to him, let him know my name.  That was so funny, man.  Hi, Jimmy Norton here.  I'm Jim Norton.  Oh, Jim.  That's all you want.  Oh, Jim Norton? 
[01:54:00]  Wait a minute, I saw you.  That's all you're looking for.  He just needs the love and attention and adulation of celebrities.  I really knew that it wasn't coming to.  It never does.  It only has once.  It always knows.  Once?  Happened more than that.  On the phone, I'm saying.  Oh, on the phone.  Yeah.  It's never going to happen.  Who was it on the phone?  Edward Norton.  Edward Norton, yeah.  A little actor named Edward Norton.  That's the only reason I wanted to ask that question is to say my name.  I got a correction.  Chester's Liver.  Yes, I do know that the Jets and the Colts are not in the same division. 
[01:54:30]  I made a mistake.  Same conference.  Oh, there you go.  I do know that.  But when Michael K. Williams did that, I was at home, like, kicking myself.  I know.  I saw it, and I wanted to vomit.  Because me and Jimmy are such huge Omar fans, and it turns out that Omar is a huge fan of  Jim Norton.  That was...  I couldn't handle it, to be honest.  He was like, oh, man, that's you.  And then Jimmy's trying to downplay it.  Oh, that's you.  Yeah, you know how it is.  You hug each other.  A couple of men who admire each other's work. 
[01:55:00]  Did he get up and hug him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  I wish he was there.  Their video?  Yeah.  I got it.  Let's hope so.  If not, someone's fired.  Yeah.  I was taping something else.  My deposition.  So I'm keeping quiet about the Mets saying.  I really am.  Because last year, I was doing a lot of bragging.  It was one of the worst collapses in baseball history.  Yeah.  Officially the worst, they're saying?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:55:30]  They're having a hard time.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  To say the least.  Christina in New York.  Christina.  Hey, what's up?  I'm a cardiovascular technician in New York.  And if a person was hung upside down for several days, like in foreign countries where  they torture prisoners and whatever, torture soldiers, you would die of a massive nosebleed  because the veins in your head can't take that sort of pressure.  Dead in like three days.  It's impossible. 
[01:56:00]  But David Blaine knows all that, so he's only doing it for like, I think he's doing it  for a couple hours or something.  60 hours.  60 hours?  I thought he was up there for a couple of days.  60 hours.  I have a question for her, too.  No.  Can I break this down for everybody?  Because I've heard that a lot, that if you hang upside down for 60 hours, that, yeah,  some of this crazy stuff could happen.  Yeah.  You know that David Blaine is in ridiculously good shape, right?  Do you know what this guy actually is going to be doing when the lights are off in the 
[01:56:30]  middle of the night?  He's going to be doing some crunches.  He's going to get down.  Yeah, some crunches.  I saw him swinging around before, like, and lifting himself up a little bit.  Right.  He's going to do crunches and make sure his head is pretty much upside.  Above his, yeah.  Right.  Feet.  Right.  Dizzy doing that, though.  Huh?  Yeah, Dizzy.  He's not him.  He's in ridiculous shape.  That's what he's going to do.  Because if he did just hang, like you say he's going to do, yeah, it would be very dangerous.  And, Christina, how do you explain people that live, like, in Australia? 
[01:57:00]  They're upside down all the time and nothing happens to them.  Ha.  Yeah.  What about bats, bitch?  Bats.  Basically, Christina, we're saying go away with your knowledge.  Yes.  Wait, if you keep your smartness to yourself.  Is it true headstands are supposed to be good for you to do, like, a two-minute headstand  every day?  Ah, they say.  It's supposed to get the old oxygen into your head.  Comment? 
[01:57:30]  Are you a who?  I don't think she liked the bat bitch line.  The bricks, I'm stupid.  Hit the bricks, sister.  I love when you say hit the bricks, sister.  It's so awful.  Hit the bricks, sister.  All right, we're going to do something next.  We don't even know.  That's what we do today.  Opie and Anthony.  Ooh.  Well, that's where Wolf Mother got that song from. 
[01:58:00]  How'd you think?  Wolf Mother has kind of this sound on a couple of their songs.  National Accomat, Mike Longstreet.  There you go.  Opie and Anthony heading toward the finish line.  We got Jim Norton here playing the Wilbur Theater.  I want to make it smooth this time around, Jimmy.  November 15th.  You got a third show on sale right now, right?  Yeah.  I know it was over half sold by Monday.  I don't know how it is now.  Are you kidding me?  A third show?  Yeah, it's doing good.  I'm doing the late show.  It's the only one that was available.  That's the last one I will be doing in Boston for 30 years. 
[01:58:30]  Who's doing the early show?  I don't know.  I don't know if they have another show.  I heard it, Mike.  Should I say?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  I better shut up.  I think it's a friend of the show, though.  All right.  I don't want to get about misinformation.  877-212-0&A.  Yeah.  Emmy ratings down.  Whatever.  Good.  You know why I was never even nominated for an Emmy?  The Emmys, like, house and the same corny shows. 
[01:59:00]  They are so irrelevant.  That's Anthony's show.  House.  He's a huge, huge quarry fan.  It gives me the heebie-jeebies.  I can't even watch the trailers for it.  It's just I don't like it because I get that.  I never liked hospital doctor shows because I always think I got it.  You know?  I don't like that.  It's like they come in and they're like, doctor, I have a headache.  Oh, okay.  How long have you had it?  And then they're like convulsing on the floor, bleeding from every orifice.  And house must find out what the mystery illness is. 
[01:59:30]  I kind of hate you because I was a big ER fan back in the day until you did that break  on our show.  And then I started watching ER and I'm like, damn it, this Anthony's right.  I think I got that.  Stupid little things.  You got an itchy ear and you're thinking, ah, it's just an itchy ear.  No, it's some kind of tumor.  It's a staph infection that's going to go into your brain.  Right.  What?  So I don't need to know.  Yeah.  I don't like this at all.  I like cop shows. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  We got, uh, we got, this is a weird story.  Microsoft uses a Mac.  What's this about it to do there?  I'm a PC ad.  Yeah.  To do there.  I'm a PC.  Yeah.  They, uh, you were using a Mac in order to, uh, put the piece together because everyone  knows Macs are much better suited for, uh, editing video, uh, putting together films,  short films.  A lot of people that make them, make them on the Macs and even Microsoft realizes, Hey, 
[02:00:30]  you know, we'll use a Mac to make this ad saying that you should buy Microsoft computers.  Is this, is this bad?  Is this bad for the company?  Uh, it looks a little bad.  Yeah.  I'd say it looks kind of silly.  Uh huh.  Uh, their ads are pretty much saying, uh, buy Microsoft.  So will this hurt the stock?  No.  Oh, okay.  Not at all.  This is not good then, right?  The Jerry Seinfeld ads will hurt the stock. 
[02:01:00]  I still want to hear one of them.  I heard they were terrible.  Dude.  Mmm.  Dude.  It's four minutes ago.  Well, just a piece of one.  I want to, they're not both that long, are they?  It's so bad.  But, uh.  Do we have any that are short?  Like, it looks like a commercial, right?  Dude.  I got one right here.  Is it really bad?  Oh, my God.  Oh, I'm surprised.  Oh, my God.  It's like the worst buddy movie ever made.  Oh, no.  Well, hold on.  Let's play this.  It's like 30 seconds here.  The, uh, Microsoft using a Mac thing.  I had a stunning admission from Microsoft. 
[02:01:30]  The computer software giant admitted yesterday to using Mac computers and software to create  its new high-profile ad campaign to keep Microsoft users from switching to Macs.  In a statement, Microsoft execs said, quote, a wide variety of software and hardware was  used, including both Macs and PCs.  The new TV spots parody the popular Mac campaign where a nerdy guy represents the B.C.  I switched to the Mac.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  Oof.  The, I love, love.  The banter.  No, the end of the story uncomfortableness because they try to wrap it up with some kind  of, something witty or something.  Yeah.  They just fail every time.  Jimmy.  They're trying to pawn it off like, ah, we use a lot of stuff around here.  Yeah.  If you're Microsoft, uh, you shouldn't be using Mac stuff.  No.  Especially if you're parodying, uh, the Mac.  Right.  Jimmy, do you want to hear the, uh, Seinfeld Gates commercial? 
[02:02:30]  I do.  Is it more of a visual though?  Yeah, I think so.  Is there any audio on it?  I just, I heard they were off.  I'm surprised because, you know, Seinfeld's usually got taste and, you know.  There is audio, but you have to see it because it's, uh, Bill Gates is doing visual jokes.  I'm starting to think that, uh, Jerry needs his, uh, I don't know.  He needs his gang.  What do you think?  It's been, what, 10 years now?  Something like that?  God has it.  No way.  I think it's been 10 years.  Wow.  I think, I think Jerry might want to go back to having people around him. 
[02:03:00]  Having a supporting cast.  I'm just saying.  They were showing some highlights of Seinfeld during the Emmys the other night.  Man, did he keep a straight face ever on his own show?  No.  Laughing and smiling and being uncomfortable in every scene of Seinfeld.  That's kind of funny though.  Because, you know, he wasn't an actor.  He's not an actor.  He's a comic.  And I think he did a pretty good job.  It's still one of my favorite shows.  I'm starting to think he should maybe start hanging out with the racist again. 
[02:03:30]  Or, uh, or Jason.  Or Jerry.  You know, I think he needs the gang around him.  The s*** Jerry.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  Laughing.  The Kramer meltdown.  God.  Good times.  Good times, indeed.  And he just fell off the face of the earth after that.  That was it.  You won't see him no more.  No.  It's over.  There you go.  They gave Dog the Bounty Hunter his show back, though. 
[02:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  And that seems fine.  But apparently any...  I haven't watched...  I don't watch the show.  I'm not a fan of it or anything.  Um, but I have been flipping by, and any time I see him getting somebody now, they're all  white people.  I don't think he's allowed to bring in black people anymore.  It just doesn't look good.  So it's all these white trash, uh, people that are, you know...  What is he just going...  Skipping out.  Is he going out and getting corporate guys now?  Ooh.  Yeah.  He's just getting the white-collar, uh, criminals now. 
[02:04:30]  The AIG people.  Him with his stupid big can of mace.  Yeah.  Because he can't carry.  Because he's a felon?  Yeah.  You know, it's funny.  I was watching an old, tough crowd.  As a matter of fact, uh, I think the one I was on with Carlin, because one of the stories  we were doing was about a guy, a bounty hunter, and I think it was actually Dog before  he had a show.  Yeah.  He went and arrested somebody, and they were like, should they be allowed to, or should  he be charged criminally?  Whole story.  Yeah.  I didn't say it was a barn burner.  No, no, you didn't.  And it wasn't. 
[02:05:00]  I didn't expect it to be the monumental dud that it was.  That would be a bad thing.  Wow.  Well, it's going to get better, because we're going to play the Seinfeld-Gates thing that  we think is awful.  Oh, yeah.  It's itches.  Well, it's going to get more.  I don't really understand, because someone has to, you know, watch this before they show  it to people and go, yeah, yeah, let's put this out there.  Yeah, it's good.  They didn't think just because Jerry's in it.  I think that's what they think.  It's going to be good.  You got Jerry, just throw it out there. 
[02:05:30]  It doesn't matter how bad it is.  Jerry isn't the Jerry from Seinfeld, by the way.  He's not that guy.  That was more Larry David than Jerry Seinfeld.  Right.  Jerry's kind of a weird guy.  I love Jerry.  He's just completely, he's completely, there's something really regal about him, because he's  so brutally honest.  He is really, and brutal is the word.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  He's going to let you swing uncomfortably.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Great. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, it's not like the fun Jerry from the show.  Bob Kelly would tell the story better.  Not the not used to, but another one.  Bob had something with Jerry where he bet him a dollar, and Jerry won the bet.  And so Bob comes back weeks later, everybody goes, dude, I owe you that dollar, but I got  to tell you this story about it.  And Jerry goes, if I let you keep the dollar, will you not tell me the story? 
[02:06:30]  I love it.  That's fantastic.  Yeah.  Let's see if this translates, because Jimmy's never heard it, or saw it, the Seinfeld Bill  Gates commercial.  They're working at a shoe store.  Sure they are.  What, Seinfeld is the owner of the store or something?  No, they're shopping.  Oh, they're shopping together?  What, Danny?  No, it's Bill Gates is actually, he's in the shoe store, and Jerry kind of sees him through  the window, and then he decides to go in to talk to Bill.  Right on.  Shoe circus quality.  Shoe's at discount prices. 
[02:07:00]  Why pay more?  Bill Gates.  Jerry Seinfeld?  True.  I'm good.  The left one's a little tight.  They'll stretch.  They'll stretch?  Is that your toe?  No.  What is it?  Leather.  It's a conquistador.  They run very tight.  You get the other one.  You know what I do?  I wear them in the shower.  Ever wear clothes in the shower, Bill?  Never.  You're dressed, and you're clean.  Open the door, go about your business.  He's a 10.  10.  See how that feels.  Better.  That's a 10. 
[02:07:30]  Is it the conquistador?  Guess what, Bill?  You're a 10.  They're pressed.  Are you a Shoe Circus Clown Club member?  Platinum.  What do you get with that card?  Big top points.  You know, I imagine over the years you've mind-mouted your Magnum Jupiter brain to those  other Saturn ring brains at Microsoft.  I have.  Just wondering, are they ever going to come out with something that'll make our computers  moist and chewy like cake so we can just eat them while we're working? 
[02:08:00]  If it's yes, give me a signal.  Just your shorts.  Oh, I knew it!  Oh, good Lord!  That is horrible.  I don't get it.  I didn't hear it.  What were they going for?  You didn't hear it.  My headphones are broken.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:08:30]  Just drivel is coming out of them.  What were they doing?  I don't know.  I didn't get what that was.  That was $30 million going on the pipes.  Wow.  Only one thing to do.  Got to save this show.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Rolling singing, I'm on fire again.  What?  It has to be rolling.  I won't save it.  It will.  He doesn't even know the words, this dope. 
[02:09:00]  He's supposed to be a big Bruce fan.  Yeah.  We're going to head out of here.  We're going to go over to the other joint.  Yep.  Curse and stuff.  Yeah.  We got a little blue over there.  A little risque.  I want to thank Peyton Manning for calling the show today.  We leave you with Roland singing Bruce, I'm on fire.  Some fan.  There's a blithering idiot out of the words.  This is like one of his big hits. 
[02:09:30]  He's seen him a thousand times.  You'd think he would know.  He'd know one of the lyrics.  Let's just leave this crap on and walk out.  Let the listeners deal with this.  We're out of here.  We're out of here.  I'm on fire.  I'm on fire.  I'm on fire. 
[02:10:00]  Ooh, I'm a fire  Ooh, I'm a fire  Ooh, I'm a fire 
[02:10:30]  But enough of this palaver 
[02:11:00]  Let's get the show on the road  Here we are, XM  Ah, see, it's the loyalty, Jimmy  That's why I do it every day  Plus XM sounds right  I'm a loyal XM guy  It's XM, serious XM  Even though I think we're the only ones that haven't been fired  Well, yeah  I mean, of course Ron and Fez haven't  I'm just saying, like, you know, behind the scenes people are long gone  They fired a lot of people? 
[02:11:30]  I can't even, like, check my email on my Blackburn  Oh, Blackburn  Because every day it's another depressing email  Of some guy saying, well  Well, I'm gonna go explore new opportunities  Yeah, it's a new challenge  It's a new challenge  I'm gonna go, uh, yeah, exactly  All that corporate horseshit  Yeah, basically  Amicable split  Basically, I got fired  I'm not happy about it  I just want to say goodbye to everybody  But no, you're right  I've decided that I need to go explore some new opportunities 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, new opportunities  As opposed to the steady paycheck  I want to thank people like Lee Abrams  And, uh, and Eric Logan  They thank people that are long gone  Because they saw the writing on the wall as well  And left  It's just  Ah, it's depressing  But exciting  As well, right?  Of course  Sure  Love it  Sure  Want to say hi to the, uh, the fan  The fan  That's what happens 
[02:12:30]  Monday  We have, like, nobody  Uh-huh  And Tuesday  We have one person  Uh-huh  Wednesday, maybe a couple  Thursday, it starts getting where, you know  There's five, maybe six people on the bleachers  And then Friday has an all-out  Just not enough  A standing room only, as they say  Right  But, uh, on this Tuesday, yes  One  One  One  Person  Lonely fan  Why don't we let her sit in the big comfy chair over there  You want to sit in the big comfy chair?  She's not going to bother her anymore  Yeah, right there  You know, why does she have to sit on the cold bleachers? 
[02:13:00]  That's crazy  Hey, uh, I don't mean to start, uh, I don't mean to start the message board's chatter, but  You might want to come see the live show in the next, uh, few weeks  Why?  Because that part of our, uh, show might be going away  Really?  Just saying  You never know  Until we figure something else out  I don't know  We're entering a new phase  Aren't we?  Hope so  Yeah, because, you know  Do we?  Well, because they 
[02:13:30]  Will we?  I hope so  Because they, you know, because  Because they want us to  And  See  But I also am under the impression that  When  And then  It would  And then the time  You think?  Left  Right  But with that  But  Not with, you know  With us and stuff  As it is currently  Wow  Well  When they make us  Because this  Well, we'll see how much they make us 
[02:14:00]  Because  When we talk  Right  Gotcha  And then  Yeah  But see, I don't even  It's all Greek to me  Because I haven't  Yeah  Oh, Jesus Christ  Jimmy  Alright, I'm making a call right now  Yeah  I want, um, Jimmy Norton  Mm-hmm  Uh, fired  I don't want to be fired  Then what will I do?

Who?  Who?  Uh, Gray Wolf  Who?  Gray Wolf  Who?  Oh, there he is  Yeah, Gray Wolf 
[02:21:30]  We have Gray Wolf's song  For the big introduction  Because Gray Wolf  Comes to us  Because he needs our help today  What happened?  Well, let's play his song first  I want to know  We need the hit  Here it is  Gray Wolf  Singing about Ziggy  Who is now dead  No, he was singing about  Tippi Tom  Oh, he was singing about  Tippi Tom  This is a story about a man  And he always was so lonely at night  But his voice is rowdy  You can hear it all through his train station 
[02:22:00]  And I'm going to sing this one  This is about Tippi Tom  Let's go  All we go  All we go  All we go  He slayed that night  And now he had nowhere to go  Our money's gone  And off  For all my friends  And the cop says to me 
[02:22:30]  Hey, you smell bad  Get out of here  And he says  And you know I have an angel  And he says  That angel  Shelter me  From the falling rain  You have bombs  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain  Shelter me 
[02:23:00]  Shelter me  From the falling rain  You have bombs  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain  And just a little piece  Little piece  That's right  We never got the whole piece  We had an effing fucking hit  On our hands  We still could if he could ever piece it together 
[02:23:30]  We tried everything  That's why I don't like playing that song anymore  Because just to know that we had gold  That would have been played on radio stations across America  So why can't he still do it?  Who knows?  Maybe he's up for it  We tried  We could try again  Yeah  I have no confidence in this Gray Wolf anymore  I'm sorry  No?  But Gray Wolf comes to us with a problem  A problem  Where's Gray?  He's right out here  Bring him in  Bring in G to the W  Hiya Gray Wolf 
[02:24:00]  Mr. Wolf  How are you?  What's going on?  Hi Gray Wolf  You got his mic on?  How about you talking to a mic?  Yeah  What's up Gray Wolf?  You got this  Oh  I got the cans  Now the last we heard from Gray Wolf  You did the homeless shopping spree two years ago  Almost two years ago  Yeah  And you were like banging some broad 
[02:24:30]  And you were living the high life  Well at a moment  But it's like  I wasn't living with her  I was like hanging around  The next thing you know  I was like making good money on Avenue J  And Kings Highway  Avenue J  Isn't that like where you get the H?  That's not only that  Everybody calls Avenue J Jewtown  And my father-in-law Kenny  Which is a Jew  He says  You won't make a dime  They're cheap  The thing is  I proved them wrong  I was paying rent  With like $70 a week 
[02:25:00]  $10 a day  Well slow down  What goes on on Avenue J?  What were you selling on Avenue J?  The CDs from the music of the Andes  You know those CDs I brought over  I saw I got in with a couple of bands  And I you know made a couple of hits with them  And  Wait you got a hit record?  Well  Was this after the song you recorded for us?

[02:27:00]  This thing needs like oil  It's sticky  How funny was it  Jizz  When Tippi Tom was  Playing your flute  Oh I know  Gotta get me all new stuff  God that was really funny  Yeah  We should know about that bit  I'm gonna play the flute  You know yesterday  I was sitting in front of the Times Square  Of course  At the corner of east  Southeast corner of 42nd and 7th Avenue  And here comes  Was it really important to say the southeast corner? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah because  You know why?  Because it was  That corner is like very famous  With many things that have happened to me there  Like what?  Blowjobs?  Cops  Cops  Ah  So here comes the 7th 9th precinct  Come out from New Jersey  From Brooklyn  And he says  Sir  But very politely he told me  Sir  You can't sit here  Thank you  I got up and I left  And the next thing you know  When I checked  When they left  And they got in the car  And left  He forgot one of the things 
[02:28:00]  And I caught it  Right away  One of the things?  I have a 79th pin  From his  Oh from his shirt  His 79th precinct pin  Yeah right  So I said  Oh he left me  I got a souvenir  You certainly do  So I was holding it  To see if I see him  I give it to him  Maybe I'll make a friend out of him  Like I did with Keith  He's the only cop  That tells a person  Hey what happened to you  Go east  I'm noticing that  We had you all on the right track 
[02:28:30]  Yep  You almost like had a hit record with us  You were  I remember  You were like  You were picking up girls at the mall  During the homeless shopping spree  Oh man  And you pretty much had a place to live  And now you're ripping off cops  Pulling pieces of the  Of their uniform off  Of their uniform off  Getting souvenirs  Are you drinking?  No I stopped  It's a  Thanks to Keith  I've saved my life man  This is  Oh yeah  I did like 191  Detoxes  They counted it on me  In Staten Island University 
[02:29:00]  And  That other hospital  Bailey Seton  He told me  You know  You've been through  About 125 times  Wow  You really have?  Yeah  Wow  In all the years  Can we bring E-Rock in here  For a second?  E-Rock  While E-Rock's coming  And Keith had an interesting story  That he told me last night  Apparently this black gentleman  Was screaming  In the middle of the street  Screaming  Bloody murder  And 
[02:29:30]  When they get there  He said  It's in me  Oh my god  I got  It's in my ass  It's in my ass  And  He was taking his hands  And  Ripping his asshole open  And  Like  Sticking his hand in there  And trying to pull  And he's pulling blood and shit  Out of his ass  And saying  See  It's in me  It's in my ass  It's in my ass  And  Of course  They had to get  You know  Emergency services over there  To take care of it  But  He was just stretching 
[02:30:00]  Oh my god  With two hands  Like he'd stick  Stick fingers up there  And with two hands  Pull his asshole apart  And apparently  He ripped his asshole open  I bet he had a fucking  A bug up there  Or something  A bug up his ass  Something's up there  Seriously  Something crawled up there  Or he had a fucking herpy  In his ass  I think he's crazy  Or that  And thought  That maybe  The aliens  Planted something in his ass  And he had to get it out  I'm okay  I'm thinking  He needs a little fiber  In his diet  A little fiber  So it comes out a little easier  To rip your asshole open 
[02:30:30]  Wow  He has colon cancer  He has a bad itch  He can't come off  Ah I got that itch  Hey  Hi E-Rock  E-Rock  Could you go near  Grey Wolf  Grey Wolf  Could you breathe  Into E-Rock's face  Please  Grey Wolf doesn't smell  No we want to see  If he's drinking  Yeah  What does he smell like  Cigarettes  Nice  Coffee  Cigarettes  Right on  So  You're on Avenue J  Right now

[02:36:00]  the website they went they said so if an indian was here we're buying the place yeah um kevin from  connecticut you're right this isn't gray wolf this is colin quinn colin decided to stop by and uh hang  with us today okay so gray wolf how long are you homeless how many years well in 1985 when i came back  out of jail i just bounced off from one whoa jail for what i was used to hang out when my mother died in  1981 i just went berserk i lost uh contact with reality i had a uh what you call a shock i didn't 
[02:36:30]  cry anything after that i i just end up uh losing my mind i went from there to hanging out with  drug addicts and drinks and uh motorcycles gangs and stuff and i got into a little trouble what was  the violent i don't i i imagine it was more than a little trouble yeah why did you go the joint well i was  uh what do they accuse you of it's on my paperwork it's uh i copped out to a one of three on criminal 
[02:37:00]  negligent homicide which i didn't commit but i thought since i did 18 months and right because  i might as well do this on the next six months and be out of there and then wait wait did he say  homicide yes criminally negligent that means that they believe that i knew something but i won't talk  about it homicide homicide so what happened i like the way anthony comes back and what happened after  punch on something is well the thing was um what do you know about this homicide i didn't i didn't know 
[02:37:30]  anything about it i was i was in my early stages of drinking so i didn't know how to drink at the  wet time ah i will get a bottle practice makes perfect small shots i will fill a whole cup and drink it  one shot that and how you do it no no i didn't know so i passed out when i woke up i was being  arrested and when i really woke up i didn't even know how the hell i got there about a three weeks  later i found out what was all happening about with them and that's when i decided you know what 
[02:38:00]  happened though yeah somebody got killed and uh well i assume but uh how did they get killed  a gang related thing oh no gunfire knife something like that the thing is that i kept my mouth shut  that i got through it i went back and i kept your mouth shut you didn't rat nah that's why my face  stays cute thing is that uh i've you know i learned an early stage of my my own business you know something 
[02:38:30]  that doesn't that's it i just don't pay no mind m-y-o-b you know those things that they say good  samaritan and then they end up getting himself killed right fuck being a good samaritan he should  have mind his business can you um you never know what's going on uh-huh so you come to us with a  problem today well i have um these guys are trying to help me right to get myself together but they  have a doubt that maybe they don't think that i'm homeless or that i haven't been homeless i've seen tons 
[02:39:00]  of people that died homeless while i was living with them in the streets when i started being  back together and trying to get my life together that's when the shows that you know when you guys  brought me in it's like kind of like it opened the door in my my own understanding and i said i gotta  do something to stay up and these guys are cool they did this this for me and i don't want to let  them down i want to be able to we did it for ratings yeah i know but the thing is in the process 
[02:39:30]  we helped when i went when i went into rehab i was up in syracuse uh in saragnac lake and uh  that's saint joe's the holy mountain and the counselors there says man you you're in a rehab  you're not in a college and i says well listen it's like killing two birds with the same stone because  i didn't know how to read or use the dictionary and you guys are giving me all these pamphlets about  educating me about my alcohol uh alcoholism and my disease that i have to write these things out 
[02:40:00]  so i'm learning how to read and write again and actually i'm learning how to use the dictionary  to find these words and it's actually helping me so they didn't understand that they were ready to  kick me out of the place because i was taking advantage of what i but to me it was like a great  help because i never knew how to use the dictionary all right why why did they kick you out of the place  they didn't kick you out of the place because you're excited about learning about words no they  actually something else is going on and another thing a lady there one of the wait wait you're 
[02:40:30]  you're blowing up why did they really kick you out no they didn't we need some honesty today no no one  kicks you out because you're like wow i'm trying to get a uh they didn't kick an iq here listen to this  they didn't kick me out at all they they kept me on and this woman she said i went i wanted him out  of here because i didn't know how he talks until i saw this program about native americans passing an eagle  feather and they think quietly before they speak and they make sure that that way they don't offend  anyone in the group so when she found that out she apologized to me they kept me i went to syracuse 
[02:41:00]  to one of the guest house and from there i started you know learning how to budget my money  i went to work i learned how to make resumes so that process all took place since keith sent me east  right you heard the phrase go west my son go west yeah he takes me to the borderline of the west and  he says go east it's the opposite it's crazy from that moment on i kind of like i didn't want to  let him down i says i promised him i would say stay uh away from the from his priest in the sixth 
[02:41:30]  prison for six months and the thing was i went into a rehab holy therefore two years man i went i  will get the longest term i can and i did find out a lot about myself i found out that i really can  function but in new york city it's so hard to get a job and try to build when you make better money  when you sell records and you can now work with the with the bands in the street but it's been kind  of slow and since i they don't want to try to put me on most of the time because they said well 
[02:42:00]  people see you sleeping on the subway they see you sleeping on the street and then they had you  selling records with us and they thought well what's going on with this guy give a guy a break  well these these guys from common grounds they uh they want to see if it's really true that i'm  sleeping on the street so they they're from brooklyn they're not in manhattan group they haven't come  by to see me so i thought well if i could get some of the people in new york city and around you know 
[02:42:30]  that know me and can see for themselves they could call up to this guy and tell him listen  we do know this gray wolf has been homeless he's doing that so give him a break because that way i  could get and they started to live somewhere right get an apartment what do you want to call like  eroc fans well my friends they're the ones that my my caseworkers i would like you know all right  well you got the number yeah all right eroc come in here we'll have eroc call yeah eroc we'll listen to
