<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast opened with a furious recap of their ongoing feud with WAAF radio in Boston, focusing on a recent prank where they disrupted a blood drive with a bullhorn.  They played audio of the confrontation, gleefully detailing their plan and anticipating potential legal repercussions. A caller from New York complained about the excessive airtime devoted to the Boston antics, prompting a crude and sexually charged retort from the hosts.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to a discussion of "Mr. Tools," a man who received an experimental artificial heart.  Opie and Anthony mocked his appearance and the press conference surrounding the event, employing racial slurs and offensive language while playing audio clips of Mr. Tools' unusual voice.  The conversation veered into unrelated tangents, mentioning Richard Pryor, Muhammad Ali, and *Logan's Run*. Jim Norton was present in the studio throughout this segment.


Next, a caller named Mark, heavily intoxicated and claiming suicidal ideation after a breakup, phoned in. Initially treated as a joke, the hosts offered Tool concert tickets in exchange for his location.  However, the situation escalated when Mark revealed his location (Haddon Heights, NJ), prompting listeners to converge on the scene.  Callers provided live updates as police, fire, and EMS arrived.  The initial urgency waned as Mark appeared increasingly coherent, eventually leading to his apprehension by police. The hosts speculated whether the entire event was a hoax for Tool tickets, debating the legality of the situation for both Mark and the responding listeners.  Dan, one of the first listeners on the scene, recounted the events. This whole sequence unfolded with Jim Norton still in the studio.


Mario Cantone then joined the show in studio.  The conversation shifted to breakups and coping mechanisms, interspersed with Cantone's anecdotes and impressions.  Sponsors for Vermont Teddy Bear and Optimum Online were played during this segment. Big Mike, a representative from a game company, called in to promote their services after their Ms. Pac-Man machine was interrupted by the earlier events.  Cantone continued with impressions and humorous remarks.

The discussion then turned to a bizarre recap of the film *A Patch of Blue*, with the hosts and Cantone exhibiting faulty memory concerning details of the plot and cast.  Cantone proceeded with a series of impressions, including Julia Child on cocaine and Marlon Brando, followed by anecdotes about his work on the children's show *Steam Pipe Alley*. More impressions followed, including Stone Cold Steve Austin, Joan Crawford, and *Sex and the City* characters.  The segment included vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments, along with several caller interactions and personal anecdotes. The segment concluded with a news story about a Peruvian man who castrated himself in a job protest, triggering further crude humor and impressions from Cantone.


The final segment opened with further discussion of the Peruvian workerâ€™s self-castration, comparing it to the John Wayne Bobbitt case.  The show then fielded calls, many from Sacramento (due to the time delay of the broadcast), with callers struggling to understand the context of the conversations.  A group of Irish students in Boston called in, engaging in humorous, heavily accented banter with the hosts. Mario Cantone addressed a caller's question about his sexuality. The conversation drifted into discussions about sexuality and gender roles, laced with vulgar humor from the hosts and Cantone. Numerous listener calls followed, including submissions for the "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, which highlighted absurd and unrelated details from the show, often with crude humor.  There were further discussions about the attempted suicide call and the Peruvian news story. The show concluded with advertisements for Sam Adams beer and Planet Java iced coffee and further banter among the hosts and guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  One, two, three, four, hit it!  Hold, naked girls. Hold, naked girls.  Turn, turn, turn it on.  Turn, turn, turn it on.  Hold, porno. Hold, porno.  But, it's not good for you.  But, it's not good for you.  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time?  A stupid program called the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back with the O&A show. 
[00:00:30]  Relax.  What's wrong, man?  People get upset because, I guess, our new strategy here is to stay on time with commercials and stuff.  So they get upset like it's 3.13 now, and they get pissed off that we're not yapping a little sooner.  We've been on the air 13 minutes, and we gave you six minutes of hilarity.  That's not too bad.  Relax.  A couple phone numbers, Anthony, if you're in New York or the New York area, 877-692-1027. 
[00:01:00]  Anywhere else, including Boston!  And Washington, and Philly, and Cleveland, and Columbus, Chicago, Dallas, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Sacramento.  I think I got them all.  Rochester!  Could I forget Rochester?  I got my damn starter, Rochester, on the Brother Wee's morning show. 
[00:01:30]  Anyway, the phone number for anyone that's not in the New York area, 866-277-4WOW.  God!  Yeah!  Lots to do today.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Yeah!  Snort Norton himself.  You're the second Norton I worked with.  My whole life I was called that.  Worked with a DJ named Snort Norton.  Pathetic.  Horrendous.  Horrible radio. 
[00:02:00]  That sounds wacky.  Snort Norton.  But he had some really good promos.  Ho-ho!  I think he's in Buffalo.  We'll be in Buffalo soon.  That's a terrific city.  He's horrible.  Is his real name Frank?  Awful.  No, I don't know what his real name is.  Usually, you know, their real name's Frank.  Larry.  Larry?  I think Larry Norton?  Larry Norton?  Snort Norton?  I don't know.  He's awful.  Sounds like a real dullard.  Awful.  Dullard.  Anyway, where do we begin? 
[00:02:30]  You want to talk about the Hart guy?  Yeah, that was...  Or do you want to talk about, you know, people trying to get us arrested because they can't  fight back?  Again.  That's funny, man.  Yeah.  Maybe we ought to just take care of this.  Get it out of the way?  Yeah, get it out of the way.  So we can move on with the real radio show?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Well, you might remember the fun and hijinks we had yesterday.  We never learned.  People always getting arrested because of our radio show or... 
[00:03:00]  With our little battle we're waging up in Boston, a reclaim the top spot, the airwaves  and afternoon drive radio against our old station, stupid Schlocko and Maddie over there  at AAF, where we used to work and we got fired.  And three years later, we're back.  And no delay, no waiting.  We are making their lives a living hell.  Of course.  Because payback is a bitch.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And some people are bitching that we're spending too much time talking about Boston.  If you guys can't understand how important this is to us, I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah.  This is going to be some great radio that comes out of this.  Like Scott, this tool on Line 8.  We forgot about New York.  Is that what we did the other day when we went out to the bar and hung out?  Hey, Scott.  Scott.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  What's up?  It's nothing, man.  You know, it's all for you guys being syndicated.  You know, but ever since you guys did, it's like you played every other city but us.  What do you mean?  But we're here.  We go out and hang with New York.  We just partied with you guys Thursday for four straight hours. 
[00:04:00]  Ant and I were one of the last ones to leave Hooters.  You know, I should take a step back.  Because it's not so much Anthony as much as old.  All right.  I'll agree with that.  Well, it definitely is.  Hey, because I'm off the hook.  You know, you guys play the same bits before.  Like, you know, when you replay all your old stuff.  What?  I don't know.  You just kind of, like, ease into it a little bit more.  Scott.  Pretend they ain't there.  Scott.  Scott.  Yeah, I'm listening.  No, you're not listening.  We've been doing some great radio shows since we've been having a kid.  Fun?  Come on.  Now you're just trying to cause trouble. 
[00:04:30]  I mean, we do a ton of stuff for New York.  We were out partying with you guys last week.  And last Thursday for five straight hours.  All right.  Well, maybe I'm causing a little bit of trouble.  What about six?  Maybe there's a little truth to what I'm saying also.  Scott.  What about Sex for Sam?  I just do a great radio.  All right.  Well, that was all New York.  When it was good, I'll tell you the first play has been really good.  But it's just, you know, like, we were the guys that have been behind you.  We're the only.  That's why.  It's still there.  And that's why we are here.  And, uh.  Scott, that's why it should be a lot of fun for you to listen in on. 
[00:05:00]  We've talked about it.  But that's also why, you know, you get a little taken back when it's like, you know, they're  always recognizing all the other cities.  And it's like New York.  Well, let's just suckle off our teats.  That's cool.  That'll make you feel better.  We'll bend you over the console and give you a nice tooling.  And don't dump out.  It's T-E-E-T.  You know what you're missing?  Is he still on the line?  Oh, he's gone.  It's like when a chick dumps you and you want to go back and show off the new hot chick  you're with.  Well, New York is the new hot chick.  Hey!  That's what it is.  New York is the hot chick that the ugly one dumped you for. 
[00:05:30]  None of the cities have to worry.  We're having fun with everyone, aren't we?  The Boston thing is a special case.  We're not doing that for every city because we have a vengeance.  A vengeance.  To strike in Boston.  Correct.  And I think everybody that has listened to this show and has been involved with it understands  that.  I think there's just a few that kind of get pissed.  Just screw it.  Just relax.  This is how it has to go.  All right.  But it's mean-spirited, guys.  Yeah.  Wait.  That's nothing.  Just wait. 
[00:06:00]  So, go ahead, Ann.  Why don't you recap what happened yesterday?  Well, Schlocko was out at some blood drive thing.  You know, getting blood.  Tainting it?  Tainting it, yeah.  And we had a couple of people go over there, a couple of fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  And that kind of voiced their opinion on who should reign supreme in Boston.  And it totally took them off guard.  It was really funny.  We've listened back to what they said on their airwaves about 20 times. 
[00:06:30]  And we just laugh our asses off at the unprepared babble and silence that ensued.  They were smart enough to remain silent as our guys are yelling O&A and cursing on their airwaves.  On their airwaves, right.  It was really funny.  You can find that clip on foundrymusic.com.  Very funny.  Laugh along with Schlocko as he shows that he can't battle it out.  Right.  So, now, Opie, criminal charges could be brought. 
[00:07:00]  This is what I'm reading here.  Pussy!  Criminal charges could be brought as a result of two former Boston radio DJs' decision yesterday  to celebrate their show's syndication back to the state by exacting revenge on the station which once fired them.  Isn't that full of drama?  Come on!  People are investigating allegations, alligators, that an employee of WBCN-1041-FM assaulted a disc jockey from WAAF  in the parking lot outside the Crowne Plaza in Natick during an AAF blood drive yesterday evening. 
[00:07:30]  The employees, BCN employees, were sent to the event as a prank by DJ's Greg Opie Hughes.  Oh, got my real name.  Greg Opie Hughes is coming back.  You're too good.  And Anthony Cumia.  Great reporting.  You got my real name.  And the confrontation was broadcast live during their controversial afternoon radio show  and on the AAF broadcast before it was pulled off the air.  Before it was pulled off the air! 
[00:08:00]  With utter surprise and just the most unprofessional sounding cut off the air.  Here's what it sounded like.  You hear Schlocko going,  Hey, what's going on?  I'm here to blood drive.  And then you hear our guys yelling in the background with a bullhorn.  And at that, Rocco just starts going, Oh, here they come.  Here they come.  And you hear Maddie or somebody that's with him going, All right, cut it off.  Cut it off.  Cut it off.  Turn it off.  At which point it just goes silent, except for our guys.  So they decided they're not going to say anything. 
[00:08:30]  So now you can really hear our guys going, Oh, and they rule Rocco if you suck.  F you.  They like curse.  And then there's another about eight to ten seconds of pure silence.  Because what happened was they had to get a record on the air.  Yeah.  That's how they fight back.  We'll fight back with a Led Zeppelin song.  Little brown eyed girl for you.  I could see like, I could see Dave Dickless just running into the studio.  Quick, grab a record!  And he gets some Zeppelin and they went into a Zeppelin song. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  It just sounded like we destroyed the break.  Because we did.  Of course we did.  We're just getting warmed up too.  But now they're trying to get us arrested.  You can be actually because it's a felony to point out a fat man's lack of talent.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  During their afternoon drive time, BCN radio spot, Opie and Anthony admitted instigating the episode  but insisted they had done nothing illegal.  That's right.  It's not illegal to go out there and voice your opinion that the guy that's broadcasting in front of you sucks. 
[00:09:30]  And then the beauty of the rest of this newspaper article, it talks all about us and our show.  Yeah.  They're playing right into our hands.  They don't know when to shut up and just take their beating.  Talks about the show.  Talks about how the cops were called.  That's it.  You know what's so funny?  AAF loves to think of themselves as this rowdy, gorilla, kind of underground, hip, cool, we rock kind of thing.  The second it got a little too wavy for Schlocka, what happened? 
[00:10:00]  Hey, call the cops!  Shut down the show because I can't fight back and someone called the cops.  Shut it down and call the cops.  And then make up, and then listen to Dave Diklis make up some kind of a lame radio bit.  Like a boxing match.  Like we listened to Dave, like we were going to listen to Dave when he came up with the pie throwing idea when we worked there.  You think we're going to listen to Dave now when he feeds Schlocko his idea of some kind of a fight? 
[00:10:30]  No, we battle here.  We battle here, not with Dave Diklis.  On the air, Schlocko.  This is a, oh, you didn't hear it, Jim.  No, what's right?  This is what they want to do.  This is their retaliation.  Let's do a boxing match for charity.  Why for charity?  Because that's Dave Diklis' idea.  See, Rocco doesn't come up with these ideas.  Dave Diklis, his boss, pulls all the strings.  Pull the strings! 
[00:11:00]  And Rocco dances.  Well, what does that have to do with that?  Mike Tyson's a great fighter.  He's not a funny radio guy.  Because they don't know what to do.  So Dave Diklis, in his knee-jerk wisdom, comes up with a boxing charity thing.  Like, we're going to bite on that, you dick.  With witty ideas like that, can't understand why you guys aren't syndicated all over the country.  Just the beginning, Schlocko.  The whole country needs to hear radio like that.  Maybe in the middle of the boxing match, people could throw pies in. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  That stinks.  It's charity boxing matches.  Douche.  The BCN employees had left the hotel by the time the police arrived.  It was over before we got there, said Natick Police Sergeant Brian Grassi.  The person who grabbed the AF disc jockey could face an assault charge.  And then, uh, talks about the war of words starting up between the stations.  You know what the difference is?  When you come up with ideas like, uh, you know, boxing matches for charity and all that crap,  it just shows you that, you know, radio's just a job to you. 
[00:12:00]  You know what I mean?  Today at night, this is our lives.  You know, you get it?  This is our lives.  We enjoy this.  When we heard, I swear to God, when we heard the break they did yesterday, um, after, uh,  we totally destroyed their little, uh, remote, um, all I wanted to do was more.  I wanted more right then and there.  They're down, I wanted to crush their heads with my boot.  But I like the, uh, boxing match and everybody who comes should bring a new unwrapped toy. 
[00:12:30]  Or a can of corn.  Or a coat that you don't need anymore.  What are you, stupid?  Creeps.  What are you, stupid?  You think we're going to sit there and go, yeah, let's do that.  It'll be a charity event and everyone wins.  Yeah.  No, you lose.  You lose in this one.  You're sitting there and you know there's nothing you can do about it.  We are going to roll over you like a steamroller and you know there's nothing you can do about it. 
[00:13:00]  Because this is our lives.  Enjoy.  Have fun.  You had fun for three, you had three good years when we weren't there.  Three years to do whatever the hell it was you were doing.  Uh, it's over.  Look back with fondness.  Keep punching the clock because it's just a job to you guys.  Just a job.  What does Dave say now, Schlocko?  What does Dave say to do now?  Puppet.  Puppet.  Instead, we'll just make your lives a living hell.  There you go. 
[00:13:30]  We have just begun.  That was nothing.  It really wasn't.  It was nothing.  It was just a little tease.  Tim, what's going on?  What's up, Puppet?  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Tim was one of the bullhorn guys yesterday.  Well, being first-hand and all of us being there, when we first showed up, we came running  out.  We stopped 10 feet before those guys did.  Rocco actually came over and put his arm around one of our guys.  Hey, you're a wanted man.  And then the second thing was that the guy with the tongue ring came over and was pushing 
[00:14:00]  people.  So, if there was any assault, they laid their hands on us first before we laid their hands  on them, which I'm not, you know, being a baby about it.  Because we wanted to just go over and fight them.  We just would have gone and fight them.  But that would be no fun.  Yeah, those are animals.  We're just going to slowly, like, just take away his radio career, just ruin them with  our voices.  We just wanted to go beat them up.  We could have done it in four seconds.  Yeah, without it.  No problem.  Dude, did the guy with the tongue ring...  That's not the point.  That's not the point.  We were there to ruin their radio show. 
[00:14:30]  We weren't there to send them to the hospital.  Did the guy with the tongue ring work for the other show?  Yeah, he's a little gay, little homo.  But he had a tattoo, too, huh?  He's got two earrings in and a tongue ring, and he's running around like he's tough.  It's like, dude, you don't get paid any money to work for a guy.  A crappy radio station.  You know what I mean?  What's he make in a year?  Ten grand, if that?  And he's trying to get in a fight with us?  It's like, come on, dude.  We've just begun.  You should see what we have up our sleeve.  Yeah, it's going to be fun.  Oh, by the way, real fun.  By the way, a little, because I know they listen to us every day now. 
[00:15:00]  There's a spy in your organization.  Did I say that?  Oh, no.  Oh.  Guess who the spy is?  Good luck.  Play Guess Who the Spy Is.  And guess which great information is being passed on.  All right, Tim, thanks for the help yesterday.  Anytime, guys.  You just call in the soldiers in Boston.  We'll be there for you anytime.  And a big thank you to all the people that threw their AAF shirts back at them yesterday.  Very cool.  See you guys later.  All right, man.  What did they think?  We did a great job for that station when we worked there, and everyone there was going to hate us? 
[00:15:30]  And three years later, no one was going to cooperate with Opie and Anthony and give us information and little things and whatnot.  I don't think there's people in your organization that pass along very good information to us.  This is going to be so much fun kicking your ass.  Blue Nod Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I want to apologize for some of the crybaby New York callers complaining that you spent time on Boston.  Listen, exactly revenge, take all the time you need. 
[00:16:00]  There's nothing better than aggravating people, and you two are probably the best at it.  No, we're the best at this.  We wrote the book on this type of crap.  I know.  Just don't.  Because we don't care.  We will get arrested.  We have been.  We've been arrested.  We've been fired.  Not fake firings.  Not fake arrests.  It's all real with us because this is our lives.  It's not a stupid job where people are like, oh, my God, it's my cushy job.  I can't do anything too crazy because I don't want to get fired.  I know.  Then my wife will yell at me. 
[00:16:30]  And then we'll have to grab the kids out of school, and we'll have to move somewhere,  and the kids will have to start all over.  Yeah, well, don't worry about the few New York crybabies.  Hey, guys, I've got one idea for you.  Yeah.  Can you get like a wow blimp, just a circle of building a broadcast from?  It'd be like a chicken hawk circling a dead carcass.  In time, my friend.  Great.  In time.  Thank you.  Rock on, men.  AAF sucks.  All right.  See, it's going to be a lot of fun.  And let me tell you something.  Listen, I think for the other cities that are listening and maybe don't totally understand  what's going on, you will eventually. 
[00:17:00]  But I think when we finally emerge victorious in Boston, we just got to have a big blast up  there where we invite people from other cities.  We'll invite people from all over the country.  We could fly some people in and just have a huge party up there.  And by the way, if we can't get a wow blimp, can we paint wow on Mendy's shirt and she can  jump off the AAF roof?  Nice.  A lot of fun.  Just wait.  There's more to come.  More to come.  And we'll make it interesting.  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  All right, Schlock.  I don't think we're going to talk about you all day because we do a radio show.  Oh, you want to talk about the artificial heart guy?  We have time to get into that.  Wow.  All right.  What a surprise.  You know, first of all, there's a guy in July 6th or 7th, I think it was, he had his  heart taken out and had a mechanical heart put in.  You might remember years ago, Barney Clark.  Remember him?  Sure.  He had a big pneumatic hammer in his chest with pipes and tubes coming out to compressors. 
[00:18:00]  And he lived a little while, but it seemed very inconvenient that you got to roll around  huge, like, nitrogen tanks with you to run your heart.  This thing, brand new, it's all self-contained.  The heart and the power source, it's kind of outside.  It's a little belt with a battery that picks up a sensor that's under your skin to recharge  the battery that's inside you.  So, it's virtually self-contained, just the charging units outside.  And this guy's had it in there for just almost two months. 
[00:18:30]  They never expected him to live more than a week or two.  Now, he was diabetic and he had a heart failure.  Major heart failure, obviously.  So, they weren't going to give him a new heart because he's diabetic.  Right.  Can't do that.  So, like, well, we got this experimental heart thing, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, so they'll pop it in and see how long he lasts.  Well, he's still ticking.  And first, they go to the hospital.  The doctors start talking about it.  And then they're showing you graphs and charts and drawings and showing you the machine and 
[00:19:00]  how it's hooked up.  And all the people watching and all the press that are there, what do they want?  What are they waiting for?  Bring out the freak.  That's what I was saying.  We're sitting in the office.  They're showing doctors.  And the doctor's like, okay, this strap's here and this goes here.  No one cared.  We wanted to see the guy.  Roll him out.  We want to see the freak that's still living without a heart.  Without a heart.  And no candy bars.  With something that goes.  It doesn't even have a heartbeat.  That's what he hears.  It whirs.  It just whirs. 
[00:19:30]  Doesn't thump, thump or nothing.  So, we're waiting, waiting, waiting.  Finally, they go to the guy.  Here he is.  It's this skinny guy in his 50s.  A black guy.  Looks like Richard Pryor.  Looks like Richard Pryor now.  Looks like Richard Pryor.  Nice.  Like the CP Richard Pryor.  Yeah.  Really bad.  Yeah.  And his name is Mr. Tool.  Mr. Tools.  Tools.  Mr. Tools.  Mr. Tools.  And so, he's sitting there with the two doctors around him. 
[00:20:00]  Best last name ever.  Mr. Tools.  And the press is all, Mr. Tools.  Hey, you tool.  Are you a tool?  Yes, I am.  I'm one of the tools.  And he sounded like black girl from the future.  He sounded like one of those old, let me tell you about my artificial heart.  Then they went to Dr. Twatto.  And his eyes.  Oh, my God.  His eyes looked like the episode of Little Rascals when Stimey saw the spook.  Remember that?  His eyes got like, whoa. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, the eyes like the guy in Caddyshack when the boat's coming at him and he's fishing.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  I swear to God.  I think they need to turn the pressure down in that heart a little bit.  His eyes are ready to pop out of his head.  But he's answering all the questions.  A little less pressure for the fake heart.  He talks like Christopher Reeve.  He's on a ventilator, I guess.  He didn't do too bad.  For some reason.  And they had him in a suit and a tie.  This guy wasn't supposed to live a week after they did this procedure.  They dressed them all up.  It was something.  They dutied them all up.  Gussied them up.  Hearts, don't fail me now. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And they're talking about the battery pack.  Get this.  The internal battery, the one that's planted in him, has to be constantly recharged with an outside battery pack.  So the battery outside charges the one inside.  That way you could switch over batteries without dropping dead.  So the internal battery can last 40 minutes without being charged.  You've got 40 minutes.  The other ones, I think they said it lasts an hour per pound of battery.  So you could wear this big utility belt of batteries. 
[00:21:30]  For every pound of battery you have, that's another hour of life you have.  Wow.  They're like, so if you're going to go to the ball game, you might want to bring more batteries with you.  Now, this isn't about not having a flash when someone hits one out of the park.  Then you might want to bring, you may want to bring some extra batteries if you have this fake heart thing and you go into the ball game.  Like, holy ass.  Yeah.  No, I think I would be near a plug all the time. 
[00:22:00]  Because you know what else?  You think about it.  You have a heart attack with a regular human heart.  That thing seizes up on you.  You know it.  You're like, bah!  You know?  That thing shuts off.  You just all of a sudden, hey, how the...  You're just gone.  You're just gone.  You're not going to feel any of the pain or anything.  What the hell is that?  We'll see in a second.  Steve Austin.  That's not.  A man barely alive. 
[00:22:30]  I'm barely alive.  Give me my artificial heart.  We can rebuild him.  We have the technology.  But they picked him.  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man.  Yes.  With the bionic heart.  Remember this, Steve Austin?  Steve Austin.  Will be that man.  Yes, he will.  Sure.  Mr. Tools will be that man.  And then...  Better.  Faster.  Stronger.  Faster.  Faster.  Run to your batteries. 
[00:23:00]  And I'm like, is there some kind of an alarm?  Can I go off on that?  A stupid tangent?  Yeah.  Remember, like, the $6 million woman with Lindsay Wagner?  And she would lift cars and stuff.  But she was wearing high heels?  Like, why didn't the high heels collapse?  Because they were bionic children.  Yeah.  That never made sense.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  I never got that either.  And keep in mind, when you see her jumping off a building, it's actually done in reverse.  Oh, God. 
[00:23:30]  You want to do it through the tour guide, Bullhorn, Mr. Universal Studios?  No, that's okay.  For those of you that aren't familiar.  That's how they did the effect in the Austin Powers movie, too, with him in the pool.  See, they filmed it in reverse.  Yeah.  Rick, for everybody that doesn't know, Rick, our producer, was a real tour guide at Universal Studios.  Ladies and gentlemen, you might recognize this house on the right.  It is the house of the Cleavers.  Beaver Cleaver, Ward, Wally, Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver, right here on this house. 
[00:24:00]  But as we drive around, you'll notice, hey, there's no back to the house.  This is what we call a facade, which means false front.  Thank you, Rick.  Thanks, Rick.  You have one minute to imminent death.  Please replace battery now.  Yeah, does that battery pack start beeping?  Wow.  You have 20 seconds till you die.  Sucks.  And what do you do at the ball game? 
[00:24:30]  We're in traffic.  You've got to plug.  Yeah, you're in traffic.  You know how that works?  Excuse me.  My heart's ready to stop.  It's an Asian lady doing three miles an hour in front of you.  Funny you, and you've got ten minutes left on your heart.  That's how you got to pop the hood.  That's a lot of technology.  You want to hear this guy?  Yeah, he kind of sounds like it.  At a press conference with the fake heart guy.  I wanted to ask you, why did you decide to go public, and why now?  Well, people were doing my neighbors. 
[00:25:00]  What?  To my home.  I'm trying to find out who I want.  Ouch.  It's not sad to take away all the mystery.  Have it.  Ouch.  Okay, brother.  Okay.  On your radio dial.  Okay.  You're the lady that has the question.  Okay.  Okay.  Looking around the room like, is someone going to translate this for us? 
[00:25:30]  Did somebody.  Where's the translator?  I need to write this for my local paper.  Anybody bail me out?  The audio on Neil Armstrong's moon visit was actually clearer than that hospital recording.  You know, if you've heard Richard Pryor lately, though, it sounds just like Richard Pryor.  Pryor, though, he should have been dead so many years ago because of the drugs and stuff.  So, you know, good for him.  He's still alive.  I love Pryor.  All right.  We'll try another question to the fake heart guy.  You were staring death in the face.  How does it feel to now have a second chance at life?  Feels good. 
[00:26:00]  You realize how serious things are until you get to that point.  Once you get to that point, you realize you don't want to leave here.  Feels good.  And they all laugh at you.  Yeah.  You're a funny man.  You use your...  He's not trying to make a joke.  It feels good to be alive.  That stupid voice.  Yes, Cartman. 
[00:26:30]  Stupid pandering press.  Giggle along with the man.  Yeah, they're like...  It feels great.  Oh, yes, it's great.  Oh, my God.  He's a freak!  He's a monster!  Oh, sorry.  So, what are you going to do?  Tell us a little bit about how you and your family made this decision.  Well, I was dying.  Reporters are so stupid.  They really are dummies.  How'd you come to this decision? 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  I was going to be dead in a couple days.  It was either this or, you know, planned for a funeral.  Idiots.  That's why they have me in a suit.  Tell us a little bit about how you and your family made this decision.  There was no decision to make, really.  I mean, I had a choice.  I could sit at home and die or come here and take a chance.  I decided to come here and take a chance.  And my family went along with me. 
[00:27:30]  We all decided that it's better to take a chance than sit and do nothing.  Of course his family went with him.  Was there one guy in the family that said, well, I'd prefer just to watch you die on the couch?  Yeah.  All right.  Die on the couch.  There's always one in every family, though.  He does sound like Pryor.  He sounds just like Pryor.  Wow.  Or Muhammad Ali, Kevin is saying online.  But Pryor, the voice is Pryor. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Kevin!  Hey, guys.  You're breaking up.  You sound just like the guy.  Don't come on, Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Dude, it sounds like Southern person passing out in the hot sun.  Yeah.  Somebody should have bum-rushed him with a taser.  Maybe I would have juiced him up a little bit.  Taser.  Dang, you a little better than yesterday?  That was good.  You made a comeback today, Tony.  Punching out Maverick anyway.  Hey, Tony, you like the Boston crap, right?  Oh, bitch sweetness, bro. 
[00:28:30]  Isn't it funny to watch someone get bitch slapped?  Ooh, yeah, nice.  All right, Tony.  Very nice.  We're not bitching about it.  We love that, man.  We don't want to second guess ourselves.  Great job, baby.  Great job.  We think it's interesting crap.  Maybe we could have a charity boxing match and you could punch me in the fake heart.  Oh.  That was like Michael Jackson.  Hi.  All right, let's, uh.  Where's the Chichens?  Yeah, more questions for the fake heart guy.  You're, uh, the tool.  No, that wasn't one of the questions.  That was Tony Soprano. 
[00:29:00]  Chuckle Paquette.  A Moulignan.  No.  Me Crab.  No.  Yeah, we should get Black Earl in here because he was outraged that they're experimenting  on the black guys.  Yeah, yeah, big whoop.  No one cares.  He was completely outraged.  Is he mad that the other guy has more energy and charisma?  No.  Isn't that the truth?  Yes, Ben.  I don't know if he's more outraged about that or the doll of himself that's going around the  office.  I know.  We'll talk about that a little later, Phil.  The Earl doll.  All right, here's another question from, uh, one of the reporters. 
[00:29:30]  If you had any second thoughts about having the surgery, was that part of it, the fact  that you would get such, uh, notoriety?  That is my problem.  I said, fuck.  We're about, am I going to make it?  I'll make it?  I'm not going to make it.  Oh.  Oh.  Peaceful has always been there.  No matter where you go, people scrutinize who you are and what you do. 
[00:30:00]  Um.  I'm big dick black.  What the hell is the guy saying?  Does anyone know?  No.  All I know, all I know is when you listen to it, you kind of hear the reporter almost like  she's laughing, like.  You know, these reporters are so stupid.  All these questions are, your decision to do this, based on, you had no, there was no  decision.  There's no decision.  It's like, okay.  Someone says you're going to die within a month, or we can put this thing in your, in your chest.  Not even a thing in your chest.  We'll hook you up to a 63 Buick LeSabre.  Whatever.  You're giving it a shot.  You're going to do it.  It could be, we're going to tie this rock to your mule, and you would go with it. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  Idiots they are.  Poor, you stink.  Joe, what's up?  Joe and Nate.  Hey, Joe.  Norton, what's going on?  Hey, Joe, what's up, buddy?  All right, listen, I got a question real quick.  When this guy has sex, what happens to his heart?  Well, they said that when he gets active in any way, physically, or if he's moving around,  the sensors on this thing actually start speeding the heart up.  Really?  But then, it takes more juice out of the battery.  Yeah, but I wonder if it shoots like a bullet, though. 
[00:31:00]  If you think you're dying because your battery's running low, you would start getting all upset,  and the heart would go faster, and it would burn out quick.  It's kind of like, you'd lose your rod.  It's kind of like kicking up the A.C. in your car when you're low on gas.  It's like, hmm, do I suffer until I get to a gas station, or do I take a chance?  All right, fellas, you guys are great.  You have five minutes of battery, three minutes, two minutes, 30 seconds till imminent death.  Earl representing the community? 
[00:31:30]  Earl.  Are you outraged that they're experimenting on the black guys with the fake hearts?  I don't know if they were, did he volunteer for this?  No.  Isn't this like the Tuskegee?  They just did it?  Isn't this like when they gave a bunch of black guys in Tuskegee the clap?  Remember that one?  That's true.  What?  That's absolutely true.  Wait, what?  Years ago, they gave a bunch of black guys in Tuskegee.  Actually, they didn't give them the clap.  They came in to various clinics with syphilis, and yet they didn't cure it.  They said they were treating it, but they didn't, just so they could see the effect of untreated syphilis and gonorrhea on people. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, the Tuskegee experiment.  Tuskegee, also the home of the heroic P-51 fighter pilots back in World War II.  So are you outraged, Earl?  Syphilis flying P-51 Mustang pilots, wasn't it?  Didn't they drop syphilis on the Nazis?  No?  No.  I might have my stories confused a bit.  No, I thought the guy volunteered.  He did, of course.  Well, he's alive.  No, anyone's going to volunteer in those circumstances. 
[00:32:30]  Of course.  Does it feel weird to be like, because you know, as a black guy, they say, oh, they're experimenting on black people,  but like, in your case, when they went in and removed the personality.  I mean, does that feel...  Yeah.  Now, Earl, they just completely removed any personality whatsoever.  I'm kidding, Earl.  We do have some audio.  He's trying to look tough over there, but he's cracking a smile.  Look at him.  We do have...  Your dimples are coming out.  Very lovely.  Very striking. 
[00:33:00]  Very striking.  You're always a very kissable mouth.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  I'm not gay or nothing, Earl, but...  The joke would be on you, because I'm not gay.  Yes, Anne.  At one point, Mr. Tools did show people the battery pack when the press person asked them  to take the battery pack out.  Let's listen to Mr. Tools now.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  And the reporters got scared because he was going for something else.  Of course, whip something else out.  Here he is when he first came into the hospital asking for the artificial heart. 
[00:33:30]  Mr. Tools.  Oh, oh.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  I thought that was when he was running low on batteries.  And here's the delicate operation that was taking place at the time.  And one of the doctors, very upset because somebody bumped his arm, I think.  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it.  Now, that's awful.  Richard Pryor wrote that line, right, Earl?  Ouch.  He wrote most of Blazing Saddles.  Yes, he did.  Genius.  All right, here's another question from one of the reporters, Anne. 
[00:34:00]  Take heart, guy.  My question for you would be this, sir.  How has this experience changed your feelings about mortality?  Because you were very, very close from what you tell us.  How has this changed your thoughts about life and death, sir?  I realize that death is inevitable.  But I also realize if there's an opportunity to extend it, you take it.  And that's what I did.  You sounded pretty good there. 
[00:34:30]  He said, I realize death is inevitable.  Is inevitable.  It would be funny when the guy said mortality if he said, don't call me names.  Here's what he said right after he regained consciousness after having the heart attack.  All right.  Hey, where are the white women at?  All right.  Sounded spunky there, didn't he?  Brian, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm 24.  I drink.  I smoke.  I eat red meat every single day of my life.  Yes.  They've got, like, 25 years to work this thing out and perfect it because this is going to save my life. 
[00:35:00]  Because I'm definitely, like, going to die at 50.  I got to tell you, they're doing pretty good already because this guy wasn't supposed to last more than a couple weeks.  It's been a month and a half, almost two months.  This is the greatest invention ever.  All right.  Well, it's only going to get better.  You know, you look back at it with Barney Clark and that big pneumatic heart he had.  It was horrible.  And now, you know, the advances in that 20 years, pretty big.  But, dude, it's frightening.  Like, Logan's Run where they would kill you at a certain age.  It's going to happen because once all diseases are, like, worked out, people are going to live to be 180, 200. 
[00:35:30]  So they're going to have to just start wiping you out at a certain age.  Yeah, that's what everyone says.  They also said by the year 2000, we'd have our flying effing cars, which we never got.  You're right.  We're behind schedule.  But I was saying it's, I like the trade-off.  We have pornography at the touch of a goddamn keyboard button.  I'll take the trade-off with the flying car.  But eventually, I want, you know, you pack it up in the briefcase and you're done.  Crazy yid.  Hey, what's up? 
[00:36:00]  Hey, man.  How you doing?  This tools guy, did he get an artificial heart or an artificial testicle?  Why, his voice?  He's talking like something kicked in the nuts.  Yeah, he does.  All right, man.  It sounds like decon foregone.  Muhammad Ali for decon foregone.  You got roaches?  Isn't that awful, Muhammad Ali, like when his career was done, boxing?  Decon foregone approaches him and says, hey, we got this roach spray, right? 
[00:36:30]  We want you to hawk it for us.  And they were saying that part of his disease was the chemicals in decon foregone from all  the testing and things that he was there during.  And it effed him up.  I don't know.  I think it was the 20 years of being belted in the sky.  Punch in the head by Joe Frazier.  Yeah.  And Ken Norton and Foreman.  I remember I was the thriller in Manila.  It was smoldering Joe Frazier.  I float like granite and sting like cotton candy or something like that. 
[00:37:00]  I had a saying back when Muhammad Ali, I was a what?  We got one more question from the reporters.  Roaches.  Decon foregone.  Fake heart guy at the press conference.  Sir, could you describe your feelings and thoughts and what you first did once you awoke from  the surgery?  I was happy to wake up and see people. 
[00:37:30]  The new ones are gone.  And the new that I got that far.  Yeah.  That's pretty funny, Mr. Tulls.  Because if you woke up dead, you'd see the face of the Grim Reaper just standing over you,  cutting your head off with a signal.  Figures, ooh, did I say too much?  I think it was more like, holy ass, I'm alive.  I'm alive.  Oh, my God.  I'm never going to get past this whirring sound in my chest.  Pandering female reporter cackling. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  We have to take a break.  We're running out of time here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Phones are lit, so we don't have to give out that number.  More on the way.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  As we go to break, some more Muhammad Ali.  Muhammad Ali is going to speak.  Float like a cinder block and sting like foam rubber.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I want another fight with Smolder and Joe Frazier.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  The Thriller and Vanilla and Chocolate.  What?  Too many.  I did too many of those decon foregone commercials.  All right.  Muhammad.  Set off the decon foregone in the room.  The bomb for the bugs.  Remember he was doing those commercials?  Oh, decon foregone.  Knocks them down.  Knocks out the bugs.  I know.  You didn't get it right.  Set off another one.  Decon foregone.  Bugs be running out.  Oh, Muhammad.  No, we didn't have the light right.  Okay.  Set off another one. 
[00:39:00]  That's probably what did it.  Insecticide.  I would knock it out by DDT.  I get like a boat.  I float like JFK Jr.  And I sting like a marshmallow.  Oh, that's quality stuff.  I am the green.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is? 
[00:39:30]  It's a mix between curious amusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Filth and smash.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny.  Anthony, New Jersey Cure.  Listen up.  New Jersey drivers, a lot of insurance companies, have low premiums.  You have that first accident, and then they nail you.

[00:41:00]  Thank you, thank you, thank you for checking us out today.  We were talking about the fake heart guy before break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Michael writes, 40 minutes, because we were talking about the batteries that he has to  use to stay alive.  They only last 40 minutes.  He writes, 40 minutes?  The battery lasts 40 minutes?  I can't remember to charge my freaking cell phone, and he has to recharge every 40 minutes?  I know.  Could you imagine that?  Your life is depending on a battery.  If it runs out, you die. 
[00:41:30]  That's like a sci-fi movie.  Keep the battery charged or you die.  What happens when he is sleeping?  Do they just plug him in and you hope that your life doesn't go out in the middle of  the night?  Yeah.  You know, he's at the hospital, so he's all hooked up.  They also have this little sensor thing with a readout, and it gives them an accurate  look at exactly what the heart's doing.  You know, like when they inspect your car, they hook it up to that machine, and it gives  a little oscilloscope thing going on.  Yeah, like that.  So they kind of know what's going on. 
[00:42:00]  One of his kids uses the microwave while he's plugged in.  He dies.  Well, you know, something tells me this guy isn't going to be going home and to work  and swimming and biking.  He's in the hospital until that thing seizes up.  You ever see that little puff of smoke that comes out of your RC car sometimes?  He's like a friggin' battle bot.  All of a sudden, that puff of smoke goes out.  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  He can't get out of the corner!  It's over. 
[00:42:30]  You give a little...  A little electronic smell comes out of your mouth?  I would apply for robot wars, though, if I was that guy.  Battle bots.  You probably could.  Or the new ones, robot wars.  Robot wars?  Yeah.  Taking it to the next level.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Yeah, you're talking about flying cars in the future?  Yeah.  I mean, how realistic is that?  I mean, people have trouble driving in two dimensions.  Imagine having that third one.  Oh, no.  Wouldn't that be great?  All of a sudden, now people could crash down on top of you.  Yeah, and where exactly would you fly? 
[00:43:00]  I mean, would you fly over the Empire State Building or go buy the Chrysler?  Do you think you'd see a bunch of cars getting skewered by the pinnacles on top of the World Trade Center and stuff?  Yeah.  You know, they really haven't figured it all out yet.  And I think before they get to that, they've got to get to the point of having a flying car.  They don't have them.  I keep seeing Popular Mechanics every month.  They send it, and there's always some little thing about how they almost got them.  They're almost there.  Please. 
[00:43:30]  Then you'd have people, yeah, slamming into buildings.  I'd rather have futuristic roadways.  Nothing.  Same exact road since 1950.  Nothing new there.  I want a pay lane.  A lane that you pay to go in with stiff penalties if you're caught in there and you don't have your permit.  Like, I mean, they take your car and crush it right there in front of you.  So you can pay, because I'd rather just pay a little more and get where I'm going, point A to point B, quickly.  Well, here's the problem with the easy pass, right?  Yeah.  Why is every lane not easy pass with one full service? 
[00:44:00]  If you don't have easy pass, you deserve to sit and travel.  Wait on line.  And stop stopping at the easy pass.  Slow down and go through it.  Nobody knows how to drive, man.  It's so irritating.  Imagine drunks in the flying cars.  That would be good.  Do we?  Because you've got to land these things.  I mean, it ain't happening.  It ain't happening.  Anytime soon.  We're never getting our cool Mylar suits or nothing.  We've been gypped.  Totally gypped. 
[00:44:30]  Fake heart and felony not included.  Caroline.  Hey, how are you?  What's up?  Well, first I wanted to mention that Alien Ant Farm song you were just playing.  Yeah.  The remake.  Have you seen the video for that?  Of course.  It's amazing.  It's a great song.  It's catchy as hell.  It really is.  And I like how they just put a little subtle Michael Jackson things in there.  Yeah.  But what I wanted to mention is that the Little Bronx Bombers just won again, and they're  in the semifinals now.  They just crushed some little suburban team from Seattle.  Yeah.  Our local team is making their way into the Little League World Series. 
[00:45:00]  Ooh.  They were interviewing some of the players on the Today Show this morning.  Do they speak English?  No.  Half of them don't speak English.  No.  They're all from Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic.  But the funny thing is on the bottom of it.  And why they represent them.  How is Little League?  They're from the Bronx.  Their parents all moved to the Bronx.  It's amazing.  They're representing the United States, New York in particular.  Representing.  Representing.  And they don't even speak English.  Yeah.  Then they're representing accurately. 
[00:45:30]  Well, they have a little thing of them.  You see that pitcher that pitched a perfect game?  Yeah.  He played center field today.  A lady.  Yeah.  And they have the little things that say like their height and their weight and all  that.  And then the bottom, they'll say something like, for the Seattle team, it says favorite  book.  For one kid, it said the Andromeda strain.  And then for the Bronx kid, it said favorite hobby, cleaning his house.  I swear to God.  That's his favorite hobby.  Well, they are a culture of cleaning people.  I mean, shouldn't it?  Well, it's true.  Shut up.  You never hear, hello, housekeeping. 
[00:46:00]  Hello.  No, but shouldn't baseball be his favorite hobby?  Housekeeping.  Housekeeping.  Don't you think baseball should be his favorite hobby, though, at this point?  He probably doesn't consider it a hobby.  Of course.  Yeah, that's his profession.  The cleaning house is a hobby, I guess.  You know, we need to be more sensitive on this show.  There was an article in the paper that one of the moms couldn't come to America to see  her son in the Little League World Series.  Yeah.  I openly laughed when I read that in the paper.  As you should.  At another radio station, they had a fundraiser to bring the... 
[00:46:30]  To try to drag her over here.  To bring the mom to America.  How much does an inner tube cost?  Seems to be the mode of transportation.  It's really not that much from Puerto Rico to come to America.  Exactly.  We just saw it.  It's $99 on JetBlue or something.  There you go.  JetBlue is not flying to Puerto Rico yet.  Not yet?  No, I don't think so.  Great airline.  CEO now, Opie.  You know their flight schedule?  I fly the JetBlue.  They got it figured out.  You flied it?  That's good.  Did I say flied it?  Yeah, I flied JetBlue. 
[00:47:00]  I flied JetBlue.  Flied it, is it?  Flied it.  All right, Caroline.  Okay, take care.  JetBlue, more gooder.  Yeah.  Just seeing where we want to go.  There's so much going on here.  Oh, yeah, this guy needed...  Mark, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up?  What's up, Mark?  Yeah.  I just want to let you know that I'm drunk right now, okay? 
[00:47:30]  Is this Mr. Tools?  What?  The artificial heart?  You're drunk.  I'm drunk.  Yeah.  And I took relaxers.  You took what?  Some muscle relaxers.  Some muscle relaxers?  I took 10 of them.  10 of them.  All right.  Please tell me you're driving.  So you're trying to kill yourself, sir?  Yeah, more or less.  That's a pretty good way to do it.  And I'd like to talk to you guys before I die.  What's the matter, dude?  Why do you want to do that?  Well, girlfriend left me. 
[00:48:00]  Well, I've got dumped, too.  So what?  You just move on.  It sucks, but you move on.  Your girlfriend dumped you, so you decided to take some muscle relaxers?  Dude.  Dude.  When you last a couple of minutes on earth.  I know that.  I listen to you guys every day.  Yeah, don't curse.  I mean, you're going to ruin your life.  Don't ruin ours.  What'd you take?  What'd you take, really?  I drank a cup of vodka.  Yeah.  I had four shots of black house.  Yeah.  And I took ten of these muscle relaxers that I got prescribed to me a couple months ago. 
[00:48:30]  For what?  Uh, my back.  Read the label.  What's the actual name of the drug?  You want me to read them?  Go ahead.  Let me turn off my air conditioner, because it's, like, too noisy.  Hey, we...  Nah, you don't want to stink.  If no one finds you, leave that AC blasting.  All right.  I...  Read the label.  Read the label.  It says, may cause drowsiness.  Alcohol may intensify this effect. 
[00:49:00]  What's the name of the actual thing?  Methacarbamol.  What?  Methacarbamol.  Methacarbamol.  Spell that.  M-E-T-H.  E-T-H.  O-C.  O-C.  A-R.  A-R.  B-A-M-O-L.  All right.  All right.  Let me say that.  And where do you live, Mark?  Rick?  I live in Hodden Heights, St. Jersey, right? 
[00:49:30]  Philly.  You live in where?  Hodden Heights, New Jersey.  All right.  Right out of Philly.  Right out of Philly?  Yes.  All right.  And what's your last name?  Mark?  Yeah.  What's your last name?  I'm going to give my last name.  Yes.  What?  I don't think I should give my last name.  Ah, then you're cool.  You don't want to die.  All right.  How long were you dating this chick for?  How long were you dating this chick for?  Yeah.  How long were you dating this chick for? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mark?  Are you falling asleep?  No, but I'm sick.  Mark, you...  What are you on?  Your cell phone?  You're on a cell phone with Brent.  Which means you're in a car or something.  Mark?  I'm in front of my house.  You're in front of your house?  I'm in front of my house.  What?  All set.  Cell phone.  Hold on.  He's got no cell phone in his house.  Should we save his life or let him die?  Well, I got distracted because our Ms. Pac-Man machine arrived. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, thank God.  All right.  Screw this.  Woo!  Think I'm kidding?  Did you see that guy wield a Ms. Pac-Man machine past the studio door?  We're going retro around here.  Thank God.  We got the foosball table?  Oh, is that dedicated to our little friend on the phone?  Is he still here?  Hello?  Mark?  Yeah.  You're full of crap.  You're on a cell phone.  I know I'm on a cell phone.  All right.  Why are you on a cell phone?  Because I don't have a home phone. 
[00:51:00]  You don't have a home phone?  No.  I owe Verizon too much money.  All right.  Is that why you're going to try to off yourself?  Well, dude, this girl, just like, I was doing bad.  I was in a poor living situation.  And this girl gets me into an apartment and got me a really good job.  And now she wants to leave me.  What's the, um...  I thought you said she left you.  She's leaving me.  She's in the process of leaving me.  How long are you dating her?  Six months.  Six months and you're going to kill yourself for some broad of you nuts? 
[00:51:30]  Six months?  I love her.  Don't stop it.  I love my ex-girlfriend too.  Who cares if she's living or dead?  How old did you say he was?  How old are you?  Um, I turned 21 on Saturday.  Ah, geez, dude.  That's a little too young to off yourself.  Look at Mr. Tools.  He's still hanging on to life with his artificial heart.  He sees value in it.  Dude, if you're a Met fan and you kill yourself, I almost understand.  But if some broad after six months dumps you, come on, stop.  Well, I guess I should die because I am a Met fan. 
[00:52:00]  All right, well.  We think you're full of crap, man.  What's the...  I know you...  Okay, listen.  I know you guys...  I'm just...  I'm out here for an intention getter.  But the whole thing is, if I do die, I don't know if I will die.  Yeah.  I just wanted to talk to you guys because I think you guys are totally awesome.  All right.  All right, Mark.  Well, maybe you should, like, tell us what street you're at so we can save your life.  Yeah, save your life.  And, dude, you're not 21.  It's illegal for you to be drinking. 
[00:52:30]  I am 21.  Oh, okay.  I turned 21.  Hey, Mark.  I'm on August 18th.  Mark, if we save your life, we will give you tool tickets.  They're coming to Philly.  You want to do that?  We'll trade your life for a pair of tickets.  How's that?  Cool.  It seems pretty cool.  Yeah, right?  All right.  What do I got to do?  All right.  Hold on.  And then we're going to need your address to send you the tickets, though.  All right.  You promise me you'll send me tool tickets?  We promise we will give you tool tickets.  Yeah, but we have to give you our address out so someone can save your life, and then 
[00:53:00]  we'll give you the tool ticket.  See?  See how that works?  All right.  I just don't want to give my address on the air, though.  All right.  Give it off the air.  All right.  Who do I got to talk to?  But we need to send someone over there.  Just get his town name and call them.  Yeah.  What town are you in?  I'm in Haddon Heights.  And you took, what, 10 muscle relaxers?  Yeah.  And you have lots of alcohol in you?  Well, I drank about a...  Oh, you keep breaking up, dude. 
[00:53:30]  We want to save your life, but we've got to make it sound good for the radio.  All right.  Do you hear?  Don't make it work for it.  Right.  This isn't Rich Voss, is it?  You almost hear him talking over the big teeth of his.  Yeah.  Who's in the studio right now, bro?  What?  Yeah, it's Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's in the studio.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Mark, all right.  Who can we call to, like, save your life, and then we'll give you the tool tickets?  Because we've got to be able to save your life to give you the tickets.  Someone is saying this.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Rachel wants it on this. 
[00:54:00]  Rachel.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  You tell me.  Nothing.  I want tool tickets.  The kid's not going to die.  Oh, he's not going to die.  Look at this.  Now there's people going, he's not going to die.  Give me the tool tickets.  See that people trying to take your life for tool tickets.  That's so great.  Mark, I might have to give the tool tickets to someone's door.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to curse.  They'll get it down the hall.  You don't sound as close to death's door as you would if you drank so much vodka and took ten muscle relaxers. 
[00:54:30]  All I know is I just want this, like, emotional pain to go away.  All right.  Give out your address on the air.  If a guy stops in front of your house and sees you in the car on the cell phone and can verify that it's you, I'll give you tool tickets.  That means I have to go outside, then, because I'm inside my living room.  You said you were outside the house before.  I said I'm inside.  Oh, all right.  You're breaking up.  Well, yeah.  I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  You go outside on your front lawn.  You give your address.  First guy that shows up that can verify that it's you, then we'll give you the tool tickets. 
[00:55:00]  Then you get the tool tickets.  All right.  Hold on one sec.  All right.  Are you there?  Yeah.  What do you got to do?  And if you don't want people to know you're dressed, then, like, go to the, you know, go to the corner and give us the, you know.  Give us the corner you're on.  Right.  All right.  What corner of?  What?  Ron.  He's going to give the corner.  I'll have a better reception in a minute.  Wait a minute.  He's going outside.  He's going outside?  He's going outside?  I'll have a better reception.  Could you get a new cell phone planned before you die? 
[00:55:30]  This stinks.  My cell phone sucks.  Never buy a Motorola.  All right.  So where are you going now, Mark?  I'm going outside and have better reception.  What?  He's going to buy a Motorola, he said.  Ron, I know you're ready to drop dead and all, but we're doing a radio show here.  Snap it up.  Right.  Don't sound so depressed.  If we're going to save you, we've got to save you before the commercial break.  Yeah.  Yeah, this isn't sponsored, you know.  Yeah.  This guy's suicide.  Sponsored by Sam Arnie Goatweed. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  That's a great ad for Sam Arnie.  Hello?  Hey, Mark.  All right, where are you?  Hey, can you guys hear me?  Yeah.  Now we can hear you nice.  All right, because I'm outside now.  I'm by my truck.  All right, you're by your truck.  What street are you on?  Well, I don't want to give my exact address, but I'll give you the cross street.  Give the cross street.  Here's how it's going to work.  You're going to give a cross street.  Someone that's in that area is going to drive by.  Then we will talk to that person and talk to you, and you get the tool ticket.  And guess what?  The person that shows up first to save Mark's life will also get tool tickets. 
[00:56:30]  How about that?  Mark?  I am on the corner of the Black Horse Pike.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  It crapped out.  Say it again.  I'm on the corner of the Black Horse Pike.  Black Horse Pike.  Uh-huh.  Black Horse Pike is the name of the street?  Yeah.  Yes.  Also known as Route 168.  Okay.  And Narbeth Avenue in Haddon Heights.  And Narbeth Avenue. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  First person that gets there and saves his life and gives us a little lowdown on what's going on.  Gets tool tickets and you get tool tickets.  And you'll get tool tickets as well, Mark.  Unless you're dead already, then we are not obligated to give you the tool tickets.  All right.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say I do die.  Yeah.  You're not going to die.  If you just gave out those two streets, you're fine now.  Why?  Honestly, I want to die because I just want the pain to go away.  Oh, it'll go away. 
[00:57:30]  Tool is great.  I just...  Dude, you know what's going to happen?  You know, don't...  In a year or two, not even you're going to look back and go, God, was I a dick.  If we give you the tool tickets and then you off yourself before the tool show, there's  going to be a lot of pissed off people there.  Pretty pissed.  Yeah.  Because then, you know, someone else could have gone to tool.  All right.  Did you really give those streets?  What's that?  Those were the real streets?  I swear to God.  Black Horse.  Black Horse, Pike. 
[00:58:00]  You better watch out when you're slamming right now.  Black Horse, Pike.  Yeah.  And Narbeth Avenue.  I'm standing right on the corner.  All right.  Know what sucks about this?  There's a long delay, so it's going to take a while before people get the air.  Yeah, it's going to take a while for Philly to get out there.  I know.  You guys have a...  It's about a five-minute delay.  Five minutes outside Philly?  All right.  Oh, by the way...  Yeah, I'm about ten minutes outside Philly.  All right.  Hold on.  By the way, Tool's going to be at the First Union Center Thursday, September 27.  Tickets go on sale this Saturday at 10 a.m.  I love this show.  Through Ticketmaster.  Hold on.  I want to see if Sean's close. 
[00:58:30]  Hold on.  First person that shows up will get Tool Tickets, and Mark will get them as well.  Sean.  Dude.  Are you close to where he's at?  Yeah, I'm on King's Highway.  I'm heading up towards Black Horse, Pike.  I'm about two minutes from Black Horse, Pike.  All right.  First person there will get the Tool Tickets.  All right.  Cool.  Hey, do me a favor.  Yeah.  Ask him if I make a right or a left on the Black Horse, Pike.  I can't remember him.  Mark?  Are you coming from Del Mar or Haddonfield?  Haddonfield.  He sounds pretty lucid now. 
[00:59:00]  You're going to make a what?  Yeah, you are.  I'm going to make a what?  Is that you right?  Yeah, yeah.  Someone just pulled out.  All right.  Hold on.  A little red escort.  Uh-oh.  Someone pulled up in a Volkswagen right now.  All right.  Well, then, Sean, we'll have to let you go.  Yeah, I can do one of those loose bags.  Someone else showed up already.  All right.  Don't clear.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Go back to Mark, who is sounding very lucid now.  What's going on with that?  Hey, Mark.  Mark, you sounded a lot more effed up before.  Okay.  Yeah, someone just showed up on the corner here. 
[00:59:30]  Is it a Volkswagen?  Yeah.  All right.  Give them the phone.  All right.  They want to open up.  They want to talk to you.  All right.  No.  Drive away with his phone.  No.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  What's your name, man?  Hey, this is Dan.  Dan.  How effed up does this guy look?  I have somebody else just pulled up.  What's up?  Does this guy look effed up?  He looks pretty whacked.  He looks pretty whacked?  Yeah.  His eyes are all messed up.  Are they?  Ask him to show you the bottle of pills. 
[01:00:00]  You got the bottle of pills, man?  Hey, you got the bottle?  What's that?  They want to see the bottle.  I got to run up to my apartment.  All right.  You want to wait while he runs up?  I'm going to pull up to his parking lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can do that.  This is who you want to send in your life, too.  Some retired O&A listener.  Hey, Dan.  I don't know.  There's some other guy here, I guess.  I don't know.  There's going to be a lot of people there in a few minutes.  Dan.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Yo.  Are you a huge Tool fan?  Yeah, I sure am.  You were the first person on the scene to save Mark's life, so you got a pair of tickets 
[01:00:30]  to see Tool at the First Union Center Thursday, September 27th.  Tickets go on until Saturday.  How do I collect those?  You'll stay on the line.  Can I give you my cell phone number, too?  Because this guy is terrible.  Yeah, hold on.  We'll figure it all out, but we just want to make sure this guy is going to be all right.  Let's go through some of the overdose symptoms of methicarbomol.  All right.  If he's not whack, do I still get the tickets?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, severe weakness, fainting, breathing 
[01:01:00]  difficulties, irritability.  He just kind of looked like he was sweating.  Seizures.  Feeling of paralysis.  Profuse sweating.  Is he sweating?  Yeah, he just...  I wouldn't say profuse.  He was wearing, like, a black T-shirt and stuff, though.  He was out here sweating.  Some other...  Some guy just ran up with him.  He looks pretty effed up, though?  Uh, not really.  I mean, I wouldn't call, like, 911 if, you know...  Right, right.  Wow, you wouldn't believe...  I guess you probably wouldn't believe how many people are out here.  He better be dying. 
[01:01:30]  Wow.  Yeah, they hate to think we saved somebody who didn't need to be saved.  These toll tickets are very valuable for our radio show.  Yeah, and we're just giving them all right.  Oh, wait.  So there's about 10 guys in the apartment.  Oh, he won't let anybody out.  Oh, here he comes.  All right, he's coming back out?  All right, he's got the bottle of vodka.  Does he have the pills on him, though?  You got the pills on you?  Let me shoot out of the phone real quick.  Let me talk to them real quick.  Cops here.  Hang on, hang on.  Oh, the cops are there.  Yeah.  Good.  Let me talk to them.  I want those toll tickets. 
[01:02:00]  Now I got the police here.  Ah, there you go.  Well, good.  I guess they want the phone.  That's fine.  Make sure you get me back for those tickets.  Hang on.  All right.  We got to take care of Dan and Mark.  Hey, police guys.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Hello.  You cop?  Hello.  All right.  We got the cops there.  Hello.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, why don't we just do a road show in that neighborhood now?  Yeah.  Sounds like a lot of fans in that neck of the woods. 
[01:02:30]  We got enough people there.  Hey, what's going on?  Somebody better tell us what's happening there.  Hello.  Well, I don't think he's going to die.  Wouldn't it be great if we could get his ex-girlfriend and hit a wow?  Ah, that's awful.  Wouldn't that be nice?  All we can find was the last number, isn't it?  Yeah, I wasn't.  I'm trying to listen in at Chris calling.  All right, listen.  Who's got the phone?  Yeah, no one's talking on the phone. 
[01:03:00]  They're just holding it up.  Who's got the cell phone?  Hello?  Hello?  Someone with a cell phone in the area.  Please give the show a call.  Hello?  Hi.  Hello?  All right.  Hello?  Hello, officers.  No?  Mike says, just tell him to J.O.  That might help.  Can't hurt.  Can't hurt any situation.  Ever. 
[01:03:30]  Ever.  Why did they grab the cell phone and they're not talking to us?  I don't know.  Officer?  Officer?  I'm feeling really good about the fact that, you know, a new city, Opie, and the cops showed  up so quickly.  That's good.  I'm feeling love.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hello?  Oh, this guy's 21.  Is anyone there?  Where's your idea?  What's the fuck out of the house?  Now they're rousting them.  Where's your idea? 
[01:04:00]  Who was on the phone with YSC?  I was.  You were.  You're the one, right?  You're the one, right?  You're the one with your girlfriend?  Yeah.  Okay.  Come on over here, Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Bob, what do you think, LT?  You think he's going to make it?  What do you think, Bob?  Always time for a platoon reference.  You don't want to make sure, okay?  All right.  I understand, okay?  If you need some help, we'll get you some help.  Okay?  Yeah.  All right? 
[01:04:30]  All right.  Hold on.  You came, brother.  I'm fine.  All right, Mark.  I'm going to have a seat in the park.  Sean.  Yo.  What's happening?  Yo, man.  You would not believe how many cops are here, guys.  Really?  You would not believe.  There's got to be about 10 cops here.  You're the one on the phone with YSC, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, Sean.  What's going on?  You have to be our eyes.  Well, they pulled the one guy aside, and they pulled the guy who showed up first aside,  and they're, like, questioning both of them.  And I don't think that guy, Mark,'s messed up at all, dude.  Well, he is now.  Jesus.  Now he is. 
[01:05:00]  What's that?  They hung up the other phone.  Sean, you still there?  Yeah, I'm still there.  All right.  They hung up the other phone.  So you've got to describe what's happening.  Yeah.  How many?  Well, you've got about four or five undercover cops here.  You've got three marked units and detectives.  What they're doing right now is they're questioning the guy who showed up first, and he's sitting  here in a silver Volkswagen. 
[01:05:30]  They pulled him out of the car and are questioning.  Oh, that poor guy just showed up.  The guy who called in, and Mark, I guess, he's, like, nowhere around.  I don't even know where he went.  Well, when they got out of jail, they're going to tour.  I think the guy was joshing you, man.  They put him in the car, I think.  No, the guy that originally made the call and said he was killing himself, is he there?  I think he is, because what I heard on the phone.  I don't see him, though, dude.  But I think they took him in the car, because what I heard from the other cell phone was  the cop asking him, are you the guy with the girlfriend that originally called YSP? 
[01:06:00]  And he said yes, and he goes, okay, Bob.  All right there, Bob.  Get in the car, Bob.  Why are you killing yourself?  Jewish?  What do you think, Al P?  Sean, that's what I thought.  That's what I thought.  Sean, how many cars are there now?  Hold on a second, hold on a second.  I've got a bad feeling about this one, Bob.  I was just showing up to see if this guy was, like, telling the truth.  I live right down the street.  Okay.  And I was just listening to the radio show.  What did you see?  Nothing.  I just saw the guy over there in a silver car, and he was talking to the guys on the radio,  and the guy came out, and you guys showed up. 
[01:06:30]  Where did he come out from?  He was over here on the right-hand side.  He was over in there?  Yeah.  Like I said, I don't know.  I have no idea whether he was in a vehicle or not.  Like I said, I just pulled up, like, two seconds before you guys came out.  Yeah.  I live in Haddon Heights, so I figured I'd just come on over and see what was going on.  Did you guys hear that?  Yeah.  See, I can see what's going to happen here.  It seems to me like the cops are going to start to think maybe we, like it was a bit.  No, there's no bit.  The guy called up out of nowhere. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, boy.  Right.  I think they're actually going to arrest this guy.  How could they arrest him?  He called up.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, they're looking to see if he was driving, to see where he lived, or...  Why, is being a horse's ass illegal?  I mean, you've got firefighters, EMTs here.  Well, you know something?  The guy calls us up.  He says he drank vodka, Black House, which is really good, by the way, and took 10 muscle  relaxers.  Well, you know, I think it's our civic duty to, well, let him die. 
[01:07:30]  Make sure the guy isn't BSing.  You have to.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  There you go.  If he's being a tool and calling up a report like that to us, I don't know what legal ramifications  there are.  Can you look it up?  Hey, is it like hooking you guys up?  Can I get the tool tickets anyway?  I love you guys, man.  I listen to you like every day.  Well, yeah, I think we got some, don't we?  Yeah, hold on a line.  Because Mark might be busy the day of the tree.  You guys are so cool.  Thanks, man. 
[01:08:00]  How many people are there now?  Well, we got one, two, three undercover.  A couple detectives.  One, two, three, Mark cars.  Don from East Meadow saying he should have hid under the kiddie pool on the lawn, like  that guy did in cops.  You never hide under the kiddie pool.  He hid in some apartment above a business.  Really?  And now there's a couple of them going inside to see what's going on, I guess.  Glad to see that the cops listened to us in the Philly area.  Steve, what's up? 
[01:08:30]  I think actually somebody might have called him.  Steve.  No.  Steve, you in the area?  Steve, what's up, man?  Yeah, man.  Across the street.  All right, what's going on?  Steve was talking on the phone, calling you guys.  Dude, he looked fine, man.  I think he was just being a tool trying to get some tickets.  He sounded out of it.  I mean, I think you should take his tickets, and he's kind of inconvenienced me because  I'm late for work now.  Right.  Give me the tickets, too.  A lot of people in the area right now?  About 10, 15 people.  Yeah.  Okay.  I mean, it's not that bad.  I mean, bad time to do it, though, you know what I mean?  All right, Steve.  Well, the thing is, it wasn't a ticket giveaway. 
[01:09:00]  Like, we didn't even mention that we were going to give anybody anything.  We just said, if you get the information, we'll, you know, give us some information.  It was a way to get him to get out his name.  We'll give you a tool ticket.  Hey, Sean, can you see the guy?  Yeah, I saw him.  He was wearing, like, a black shirt.  They got him in the back of a squad car right now.  All right.  And they're questioning the guy that pulled up first in that Volkswagen that got there first.  Working him over with a phone book?  Yeah, they're questioning the guy that pulled up first.  Wait, the guy that pulled up first?  Just sitting there, like, around, like, everyone just standing there. 
[01:09:30]  Wait, who's this?  Who's this?  Kevin?  Yeah.  You're checking it out, too?  Yeah.  All right.  If the cops are listening to the broadcast, the first guy that pulled up was just pulling  up to make sure this guy was okay.  They'll get to the bottom of that.  All right, all right.  It's not like these are the same people that run around throwing bombs into buildings.  Dude, it looked like they're actually tearing him in a new way.  Come on, I'm kidding.  What are they doing?  They're tearing him in a new way.  They're yelling and screaming at him in the back of the patrol car?  Well, they got one of the head firefighters.  He's in there, and he's like, and he looks like he's tearing him in a new way. 
[01:10:00]  It's like, what the F is wrong with you?  The guy that called first is walking towards us right now.  All right.  Get him on the phone.  Tell him you're on the radio with us.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  They want to talk to you.  This is so funny.  Dude, what happened?  Is this Dan?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  You're the guy that pulled up first to see if this guy was BS or not.  What's up?  Run us through everything.  You want it.  All right.  Run us through everything that just happened.  All right.  Hold on.  Because there's so much going on.  Kevin and Sean, you're still on the line, but just don't say a word. 
[01:10:30]  Let Dan talk.  Dan.  Yes.  All right.  Tell us what happened after you gave the phone to the cop.  After I gave the phone to the cops, they took Mark, and they're talking to him right now.  I'm going to pull up.  And what do they say to you?  Well, at first, I don't know.  At first, I thought they were going to jack me up or something.  They didn't know what was going on, but they're cool now.  They just took my knee down and then we were here with these guys.  You want to come up?  Got to the bottom of it, huh?  What are they doing with the perp? 
[01:11:00]  Dan.  The perp.  I don't know.  There's a bunch of people on the phone around here.  Yeah, I know.  They're all calling us.  They're helping us out here.  I hope you got a lot of cool figures.  No, no.  Hey, Dan.  Yeah.  Now, does it look like this guy's effed up or not?  Yeah.  Now that I've looked at him a little bit, he does.  He definitely looks effed up.  He's a little too relaxed.  We're getting in the back of the police car.  Are they going to take him away, you think?  The ambulance?  I think so.  You think they're taking him away?  I think they're trying to get him help.  I don't think they're... 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  Even if you're goofing around like that, you know, maybe you should talk to somebody.  Yeah, it was stupid.  I mean, they have to do something with him.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Hold on, everyone.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's getting crazy.  Let's go to Gary.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, Gary.  Hello?  Gary.  Hello.  What's up?  This is Johnny.  All right, Johnny.  What's up?  Nothing much.  I don't know.  The guy didn't look that fired up.  I think he was just trying to get some tickets out of you guys.  Yeah, but it didn't start with us giving away tickets.  Yeah, it started with him calling. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  It was just our way to try to get this guy to give out some info so we could see if he was effed up or not.  That's all.  Well, I mean, he was trying to get something out of you.  I don't know, but...  It wasn't a ticket giveaway.  He was a little fired up when I walked up.  He was staggering.  But if he took 10 pills, I would think he'd be like...  By now, if he took 10.  He could have been laying on the carpet out in the middle or in the middle of Black Horse Bike by now.  And then vodka and Black House.  He should be pretty effed up by now.  Well, he came walking out.  When I pulled up, he was coming walking out of the building, the apartment with a bottle of Black House in his thing. 
[01:12:30]  And he said, and he was coherent enough to go, oh, man, it's the cops.  And he put the bottle down.  So, I don't know.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I hear you.  You know, but this is a fiasco out here.  At least it was a Black House bottle.  No, let me count the cop cars that are here just now.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  There's eight, unless there's one up in the parking lot.  And four of them are, like, undercover. 
[01:13:00]  This guy, I hope he doesn't have to flip the bill for this.  He'll be paying forever.  They're still questioning him in the back of the car there?  Yeah, they still got him.  All right, Johnny.  Thank you.  All right.  Hey, where's my tickets?  We got to give it to Dan.  Hold on.  Oh, Dan.  Where's Dan?  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, we should take a break.  Hey, Matty, let's do a fake guy taking pills cop thing.  This is how it happens.  It just comes out of nowhere.  What the hell is this?  It doesn't get much realer than this today, folks. 
[01:13:30]  Am I the only one that now understands why his girlfriend dumped him?  Smart move.  What a coincidence.  For tool tickets, a tool like him calls up.  All right, here's the deal.

We had a, what do they call it, a situation.  It's a major situation, and we got an update.  And so, really quickly, well, we had some guy call us up.  What the hell was his name? 
[01:15:30]  Mark.  Mark, and say he had taken 10 muscle relaxers and drank some vodka and Black House.  And he was killing himself because his girlfriend of six months that he was deeply in love with had dumped him.  So, we told him we would give him tool tickets if he told us what his address was or where he was going to be.  So, one of our listeners maybe could drive by, scope it out, see if he was indeed effed up, trying to kill himself, whatever. 
[01:16:00]  Just going to do a little recon, see if he was serious about this.  And he, guess what, he was into tools, so he gave his address.  The cops showed up.  A whole bunch of them.  Cops, fire trucks, ambulances.  Which is kind of a good thing, because you don't know.  You've got to take these things seriously.  Sean.  You.  What's going on?  Well, they brought him out in handcuffs after they went up in the apartment.  They brought down a yellow bag.  They put him in the back of an ambulance.  Oh, they did?  And I think they might have taken him to the hospital, probably detoxing. 
[01:16:30]  Well, that means something was going on, because if they were going to take him away and they didn't think it was serious,  they would have just thrown him in the back of a police car.  Yeah, pretty much everybody else is clearing out, though.  The cops are pretty much going around.  So, the ambulance arrived, and is he in the back of the ambulance right now?  Well, they just left.  The ambulance just left.  Can't we get a statement from one of the cops?  I don't know.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, ask one of the cops.  Why'd they cuff him?  Oh, so he doesn't hurt himself.  He didn't have a...  Why'd they cuff you, Norton? 
[01:17:00]  Criminal.  Hold on a second.  I'm, like, chasing, like, all of them here.  Excuse me, officer.  Can I talk to you for a second?  One of the guys running the radio show, I want to talk to you guys.  Excuse me, maybe you give a statement?  No.  No.  He's going to be all right, though?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  He said he can't give a statement.  All right.  Yeah, NYPD would have given us one.  Yeah.  Come on.  Philly's finest going to have to work on the relationship with the L.P. and Anthony show.  NYPD would have completely taken care of us. 
[01:17:30]  Maybe they didn't get a rubber dolly in the show.  This effing jack-off was such a tool.  We threw him in the back.  By the way, the guys love you guys.  That's NYPD, Philly.  No.  No statement.  He's fine.  All right.  So, Sean.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, pretty much it.  Everybody else, everybody's leaving now.  All the cops are leaving.  All right.  So, they pulled him out of his apartment, put him in the back of an ambulance.  He was handcuffed, and they have left the scene.  Right?  Sean? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  I can't hear you.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  All right.  No problem, man.  All right, bro.  Well, how about that?  They've taken him away, and I guess they're going to check him out.  Let's see what Dan's saying.  Dan?  I wonder what was in that bag.  Hey, Dan?  Yeah?  What's up, man?  This is Kevin E., and Dan's talking on another phone.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So, is that pretty much what happened?  Anything else, Dan?  Yeah, we slowly drove by, and we looked into the back of the ambulance, and he was actually  strapped down.  Like, he was on his back. 
[01:18:30]  He was strapped down pretty good?  Yeah, they were, like, talking to him.  Like, I saw flashlights going.  I guess they were looking at his eyes or something.  Right.  Um, most of the cops are gone.  And he was taken out of his apartment in handcuffs?  Yeah, he was in handcuffs.  They put him in the back of the car.  The one cop looked like he was, like, about to beat him the hell up.  He was really cursing at him.  Like, what the hell is your problem and stuff?  Right.  And then, uh, basically, he's just in the ambulance right now.  All right.  And they took off, right?  Uh, yeah.  I wonder what, uh, hospital they're going to.  We should get some reporters on the scene at the hospital when the ambulance arrives. 
[01:19:00]  I kind of want to, uh, I kind of want to know what happens here.  I think most likely they'll take him to Cooper.  All right, man.  Well, thank you.  No problem.  All right, bro.  What about the tickets?  Did you get, uh, the tickets?  All right.  Hold on the line.  I don't know how many tool tickets we gave away.  I think we gave away all our tool tickets.  Andy, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  You tell us.  What's going down?  Oh, this is nuts.  I got a couple of things to say.  It's the greatest radio I've heard yet.  Oh, you like him?  And what an effing fool this kid is. 
[01:19:30]  Should have just let him die.  I love you, see what I said, guys?  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right, thank you.  Now everyone's calling up saying they just got turned down by a girl.  I want to die.  Can I have tool tickets?  Yeah, we've all been turned down.  Come on.  Steve.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good.  Yeah, it looked like a bomb hit over there right before it all cleared out.  It looked like a bomb scare.  Yeah.  So they took him away in the ambulance?  Yeah, they're probably going to take him over to Cooper in Camden. 
[01:20:00]  Well, let's get someone down to the hospital.  All right, I'm getting off work now.  I'll see if I can take a ride down there.  All right, thank you, bro.  Sticky rules.  Sticky rules.  Yes, he does.  Yeah, he really does.  Just a couple more and we'll move on with other things.  Lance.  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Hey.  Yeah, actually, I was driving past there coming home from work and I noticed I just moved  from Philly to New Jersey.  Yeah.  He was in Haddon Heights, which is about five blocks long.  Okay.  And when you're driving down the road there, Black Horse Pike, it's called 168. 
[01:20:30]  The police district's right there.  Yeah.  So I thought it was pretty stupid of me calling from Haddon Heights when the police, it's only  about, you know, the radius is only about five blocks in diameter.  But, you know, anyway, so when he called up, I got on the phone with the police and they  had me holding the phone up to the radio.  Oh, really?  They're asking me what station is he on.  But, you know, these guys are real strict.  The police, I'm sure they didn't have, they don't even have radios in their car. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  But they're like state troopers.  They really bust your balls.  I drove past there about ten times.  I got pulled over five times for no reason.  So right away, I knew they were going to come down on this guy.  So I didn't care if he was faking it or not.  I got on the phone with the police and, you know, I told him what was happening.  He was telling me where and he was listening to you, Opie, asking what kind of pills they  were and all that.  Yeah.  And he was listening in throughout the whole conversation.  But he more than likely asked me just to put the phone up to the radio and he was listening 
[01:21:30]  that way.  All right.  And that was the dispatch guy.  All right.  Cool.  And this is all in Jersey, obviously.  Yeah.  It's Jersey.  It's like the border of Jersey.  Yeah.  Right on the border.  Okay.  Thank you, Lance.  All right.  Bye.  Mike checking in saying he knows inside the yellow bag was O.J.'s knife.  How about that?  Finally, after all these years.  So they dragged him out of his apartment with a yellow bag?  Yeah.  I missed that.  Maybe the booze and pills were in there.  Booze and dope.  Booze.  Dope.  Ernie.  Life isn't too pretty through the bottom of a shot glass, is it? 
[01:22:00]  Ernie.  How's it going?  Pretty good.  I'll tell you what.  This guy's in for it the next couple of weeks.  He's not going to make your tool show.  I bet on that.  Yeah.  That's why we gave his tickets to someone else.  Boom.  My God.  Are you drinking Black House?  Hey, don't care.  No, no, no, no.  And that was shoot, by the way.  Oh, we didn't want the tickets to go to waste, so we gave them to someone else.  All right.  That's cool.  Yeah.  They're going to take him to Cooper.  He'll probably spend about a week there at the psych unit, and then he goes to Hampton  Hospital.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  If he doesn't make it, you got any more tickets? 
[01:22:30]  No.  We ran out of tickets.  Everyone loves tool.  All right.  Thank you, Ernie.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  We definitely ran out of tickets.  Uncle John.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Uncle John.  Great radio.  Thanks.  Hey, Ope, I just wanted to say, you were talking about being more sensitive?  Yeah.  The last time I heard you being sensitive, you were having a period.  Your nipples were sore.  Easy.  Catch you later, Matt.  Thanks.  Well, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  Switching gears in the studio, one of our faves.  Yes. 
[01:23:00]  Mario Cantone.  Hello, boys.  How you doing?  I didn't know I was walking into the Valley of the Dolls.  Yeah, I know.  Jesus.  Who knew?  Christ.  The guy just calls up and decides he's going to tell us that he's offing himself.  He's been dumped and hurt and bruised and kicked around and rejected.  Stiff upper lip.  Yeah, what do you do?  You keep your balls up is what you do.  You get dumped.  You get dumped and you just go on.  You go through it.  You could drink and you could take some drugs, but only to the point where it makes you feel 
[01:23:30]  better temporarily.  That's right.  And you don't do it during a show.  No.  And you don't call up and say you've taken so much that you're going to kill yourself.  That's right.  Because before you know it, the cops are there.  That's right.  You leave that stuff for Patty Duke.  And then you go out with your friends or whatever, and before you know it, you're calling  her a slut, whore, C-word, and you don't care about her anymore.  And then your whole goal is to get her back.  You have to get angry when you get dumped.  That gets you through it. 
[01:24:00]  Get pissed off.  You get angry.  Christina, mommy, is angry.  Look at jumping Janet Jackson on the cover of the Daily News.  Yes.  She's holding her breasts, and it says, Jumping Janet.  Jumping Janet.  What?  Did we talk about it?  She's jumping.  She's jumping.  She's good.  Yeah, she's nice.  Her voice is about this big.  That's about how big her voice is.  Chris, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey, buddy.  What's happening?  Hey.  My mom just gave me a call. 
[01:24:30]  She's over at Cooper Hospital, right?  Yeah.  She heard the radio in the background.  They were listening to it over there.  They're taking that guy into Cooper.  They're taking him to Cooper.  Yeah, they just got the call in over there.  I just want to...  I'm going to get her to give you guys a call over there and tell her what's going on.  Yeah, give us an update from Rampart.  All right, man.  Thank you, Chris.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Squad 51.  Engine 51.  What's Cooper?  It's a hospital, obviously, for...  In the Philadelphia area.  All right.  And they were yelling at him.  You never would have seen Randolph Mantooth yelling at anybody when they put him in the 
[01:25:00]  back of the ambulance when...  Squad 51.  There it is.  Squad 51.  Engine 51.  Some dopey ass just took some Black House and vodka and pills.  You don't yell at the guy.  He's in pain.  Well, this guy, I think...  There's no sensitive cop in Philly, I don't think.  We're like, just get in.  Give me a head.  You know.  We really don't know if the guy's in pain.  We don't know if he was making it.  That's all about...  We'll get to the bottom of it.  In the middle of the whole thing, the guy that brought the Ms. Pac-Man machine got pushed 
[01:25:30]  to the side.  So, we want to thank you for bringing the Ms. Pac-Man machine.  Yeah.  Pull that mic up a little bit.  No problem, guys.  What's your name and where you're from?  Big Mike.  JC Video Games.  JC's statement.  You are the official game guy of the O&A show because I'll tell you, we're going to be  getting a few games and we need somebody that knows about these things.  Maintenance and whatnot.  Whatever you need, we'll take care of it.  Now, the machine you just dropped off, what is that?  It's a Pac-Man Gallagher.  It's a 20th anniversary.  They combined the two games together.  It serves the tri-state area. 
[01:26:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Gallagher.  They're combining the games?  Yeah.  I can still play just Ms. Pac-Man?  Yeah.  Okay.  Ms. Pac-Man, two people, or Gallagher, two people.  All right.  Is it Ms. Pac-Man, the one that looks like Rosemary on Dick Van Dyke?  Yeah.  The little bow in her hair.  I love the Ms. Pac-Man.  She's got the little bow in her hair.  Yeah.  And she just goes around.  Yeah.  And you do this for a living?  Yeah.  This is our business.  All right.  Give the phone number something in the company.  718-497-7070.  And the name of the company?  JC Equipment or the game company. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  I got an 800 number.  Sure.  Hit it.  That's in front of you.  I'm sorry.  It's 1-800-MISS-PAC-Man.  Or 1-866-MISS-PAC-Man.  It's a 1-800 number, but it's, yeah, 1-866-MISS-PAC-Man.  Sweet.  MS, right?  MS.  She's not married.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Ms.  Yeah.  We service Boston, all the way to Philly, Jersey, Connecticut, and wherever you  these guys are.  Give me another quarter. 
[01:27:00]  I love this guy.  He looks like the Iceman.  You do look like the Iceman.  All right.  We have to take another break because we went really long with the suicide guy.  Not really, but we've got to get out there and try out the new game.  Yeah, that's true.  And we're going to hang with Mario Cantone.  Very funny guy.  He's playing Sunday, August 25th.  Caroline's here in New York City.  Is that 25th?  The 26th.  What is that?  It says Sunday, August 25th.  Oh, is that the 25th?  I don't even know where we are.  Oh, oh, oh.  Come on, figure it out.  Is that wrong?  I think it's the 26th, isn't it?  It's Saturday.  Whatever the Sunday is. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, oh.  Yeah, that Sunday.  This Sunday.  This Sunday.  Is that the 25th or 26th?  I think that's the 26th.  How about this?  I think it's the 26th.  You are performing this Sunday at Caroline's.  This Sunday at Caroline's at 8 o'clock.  Good.  8 o'clock says 10 o'clock.  That's right.  26th is Sunday, by the way.  And I want the studio at 58 degrees or I'm leaving.  Do you plan on throwing ashtrays at women or hitting them with microphones?  No, I don't do things like that.  As AJ Johnson did.  Well, you know what?  I don't know him.  I don't know what.  But you know what?  Keep booking them. 
[01:28:00]  Good idea.  Keep booking them.  It doesn't matter if they fall down drunk on the stage.  It's ridiculous.  You know, everybody loves their drinks and drugs.  But what we do is we wait for the run to be over and then we go to Amsterdam.  That's how you play it.  You don't do it in front of the audience.  They're paying a lot of money for you to make them laugh.  You know what?  I might rather like seeing people fall down drunk on stage.  Yeah, I know.  As opposed to a very funny act sometimes.  It is really painful to see it. 
[01:28:30]  You know, John Barrymore was a great actor and he was an alcoholic and really couldn't  remember his lines at all.  And I had to feed him his lines, putting them on magazines and newspapers and desktops.  He was really an alcoholic.  Truthfully bad.  So was Gary Merrill, my third husband.  That's Betty Davis.  I would rather see Judy Garland go through that drunken rambling version of Over the Rainbow. 
[01:29:00]  I have tape.  You do?  Sid Luff was a thief and a gambler and he stole my...  Lorna, get the candy in the drawer.  The orange was right.  And Sid Luff stole my money and he's half a homo and I love him.  He's half a homo. 
[01:29:30]  Isn't it a sin?  He's half a homo.  What would you do is half a homo.  I never knew.  That's my half a homo song.  Because she was married to about nine of them.  We have to take a break.  We're just getting started.  Get your balls out.  See you later.  Come on back.  Oh, wow.  Okay. 
[01:30:00]  What did you learn on the show today?  Uh, really not too much, dear.  Not anything useful, anyway.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned absolutely nothing.  I actually lost brain cells.  What did you learn on the show today?  What I learned today?  This bit still sucks.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, Anthony, Optimum Online from Cablevision.

[01:31:30]  Disturbed.  Down with the sickness.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show in the studio.  Mario Cantos.  Yes.  Please stop that rock and roll.  What's wrong with the rock and roll?  I like the rock and roll.  You know who I like?  I like the cold play.  The rock and roll.  I like the cold play.  The cold play.  The cold play.  You know, I'm more of an R&B boy.  I like the cold play a lot.  Why do I like them so much?  The cold play.  The cold play.  They're pretty great.  Stick with Judy Garland, Mario.  The rock and roll. 
[01:32:00]  I like the cold play.  You don't even sound believable.  You know, I kick it with the homies and I smoke the punts.  I just want you all to know that.  Rock.  Mario, you don't even know how to bang your head.  I can dance, though.  Kind of elegantly.  I'm an elegant dancer.  I can R&B.  I got best dancer in high school, okay?  You did, did you?  I got the best dancer award in the high school. 
[01:32:30]  Don't you love that?  He's got the cancer.  The big casino, Tony.  I got the big casino, but thanks to Dr. Kennedy, he's curing my ass cancer, Tony.  This chemo's knocking the crap out of me, Tony.  But, oh, thank God for Dr. Kennedy.  Don't say anything bad about Dr. Kennedy.  He's good, Dr. Kennedy.  Remember that?  Tony had to send the guys to rough up Dr. Kennedy on the golf course, so he'd call him back.  I'm a soprano. 
[01:33:00]  It was great.  That's right.  You stepped out of my Sinatra, actually, though.  That was pretty good.  Well, he had the ass cancer.  I don't know what he had.  They all did.  I have a thing on my head.  Oh, all the Italian dads did.  My father did.  Hey, Mario, we're back in Boston.  I know.  I'm from Boston.  I'm from Boston.  Get your balls out.  Slap your ass up.  Pinch your scrotum.  It's today.  Yeah.  I had to do that for Paul Ian Lawrence. 
[01:33:30]  Everyone requesting that song.  I know.  I got to do it.  I'm like, all right.  I feel like I'm like Barbra Streisand.  I'm like, I don't want to see people anymore.  Yeah.  It sounds like the Coldplay.  And he was all yellow.  I love the Coldplay.  The Coldplay.  I love the Coldplay.  And he was all yellow.  I wrote a song.  I love the Coldplay.  I wrote a song for you.  And everything you do.  And you're all yellow.  And then up.  And he was all yellow.  You got to do Shelly Winters. 
[01:34:00]  Just a little taste of Shelly Winters.  Is that chicken?  Is that some chicken?  Can I get a bucket?  A bucket?  A bucket?  I used to look.  Before the Poseidon event.  I used to look like Marilyn.  I used to look.  They modeled Marilyn after me.  And then I came to waiting for that picture that I should have won an Oscar for. 
[01:34:30]  But I used to look like Marilyn.  And then they modeled her.  It's not like she's struggling.  Al Pacino is my friend.  I screwed all my leading men.  What did happen to her? 
[01:35:00]  I screwed everybody.  She was quite the little vamp back in the older days.  She had a bit of a tramp.  She was a B-A-L-P.  A vamp.  And then all of a sudden she blew up.  She did.  That was it.  She said she gained weight for the Poseidon event.  Even though she said she wasn't fat before that.  No.  She was.  Did you ever see her in a place in the summer Montgomery Clivens?  She's in the boat.  She's like, you don't like me anymore.  And he's like, shut up.  And he gets up and the boat tips over and she drowns. 
[01:35:30]  Every time Mario's on, he mentions movies I've never heard of before.  A Place in the Sun?  I've never.  It is based on a classic novel called an American tragedy.  You will be educated, Mr. Opie.  Culture and...  I bet your girlfriend's very happy that you met me because she knows...  We come from two different worlds, Mario.  And we can still get along.  You know what?  I got an interview the other day with a paper and they were like,  you think you guys would clash?  I said, let me tell you something.  They give me the respect I'm entitled to. 
[01:36:00]  And I said, you don't clash.  I said, you know what?  People think that you're big, you know, fag bashers.  I'm like, they're not fag bashers.  They're not.  I'm more of a fag basher than you guys.  I'm like, you know, Siegfried and Roy with the tiger who's gay than the both of them.  Please.  Growl.  He's like, growl.  How old are those guys?  Please, but they're stretched out, bronzy faces.  It's like, ugh.  In the Vegas weather, like, all the time. 
[01:36:30]  Just wind sandblasting them.  It's hard.  You ever see the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous?  They actually did on them.  It was so weird.  It was like, this is why they live together in their palatial home.  And they live together because rehearsal is of the utmost importance.  And Las Vegas is so spread out.  It was like, what?  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, they're sitting there like, this is my tiger.  Yeah, this is my tiger.  Isn't he beautiful?  And come to the house.  Come over and come to my home. 
[01:37:00]  Look, look at my pussy, guy.  My white pussy.  I love my white pussy.  I do the worst accents.  I can't even do them.  I love my white pussy.  We had a Siberian tiger in the studio a week ahead ago.  And what happened?  It was a little guy.  He was about the size of a medium dog.  And was it good?  It was pretty good.  Yeah, it was cool.  I walked past him and he grabbed my leg and bit it.  No way.  I'm like, I got a tiger on my leg.  How cool is this?  Ow.  Ow.  This could be funny.  Johnny?  Hey. 
[01:37:30]  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Mario, can you do me a favor?  Why, Johnny?  Can you do Shelly winning swimming?  I just did Shelly winning.  I just did it.  I just did it.  You missed it.  You're here in a goddamn time, Worm.  I'm back.  Get your balls out.  Isn't this...  Isn't that bad?  Did you just tune in?  Where have you been?  Who is this?  Johnny?  He's asking for all the hits.  I hung up on it.  All the hits.  What is his name?  He's asking for all the hits.  What is his name?  I think it was John.  Oh, Johnny.  Where have you been, Johnny? 
[01:38:00]  I was looking for you, Johnny.  Come back, Johnny.  Johnny Guitar.  Remember that movie with Joan Cromwell?  The rest is directed by Nicholas Ray, who also directed Rebel Without a Cause.  And she's like, I'm Vienna, and this is my saloon.  Now get out.  It's awesome.  Another movie I need to write.  That's actually a big straightaway film, you know.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Guys like that film.  Martin Scorsese loves that film.  A Patch of Blue, a fine Shelly Winters movie.  When I did that picture...  A Patch of Blue?  Yeah, with Cynthia Poirier.  Yeah.  I screwed him, too. 
[01:38:30]  Wait a minute.  Shelly Winters was who in A Patch of Blue?  Apocalypse Now, yeah.  Oh, the horror.  The horror.  I got too many roles in my stomach.  Who was Shelly Winters in A Patch of Blue?  She was...  Mother.  She was the mother.  And was the daughter Carrie Snodgrass?  Why is it Carrie Snodgrass?  I don't know.  She was blind.  That's an interesting...  If it was, I rule.  Then you rule.  If it was, you do rule.  Was she the blind one?  I don't know if it was Carrie.  It might have been.  Please call in.  If you know, it was Carrie Snodgrass. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  She was in...  Are you guys, like, speaking another language?  You really...  That was a good movie.  Poor Opie feels left out.  He's on the other side with a axe.  We love you, Opie, but you must learn how your culture...  I want you to write a list of my films 622 times over and over and over.  She's still alive.  She is.  I'll never die.  Never, never, never, never.  I've always been ahead of my time.  No, it's Elizabeth Hartman.  Oh, it was.  Then you...  Selina. 
[01:39:30]  Elizabeth Hartman.  Who's that?  Remember the...  Wasn't it Shelley Winters called a Selina?  Your name's Selina.  I haven't seen it in so long.  And Sidney Poitier was like, no, your name is beautiful.  It is Selina.  Selina.  He knows.  I did see that movie.  You saw that film?  Yeah.  A patch of blue.  She was a black...  I get this.  She's blind.  She's in this small town.  She meets Sidney Poitier.  Now, she's blind.  And she touches his face.  She's so handsome.  Blah, blah, blah.  She decides to bring him home to meet the parents.  Oh, boy. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, my God.  And she doesn't know.  Fun ensues.  She doesn't know he's black.  No, because he talks like Sidney Poitier.  Until she goes to turn on the stereo and it's missing.  And, you know...  Oh, God.  No, I...  No, I...  You're awful.  And the poster said...  Awful.  He's black.  She's blind.  She's fat.  Wait a minute.  Change that poster.  Wait a minute.  Ivan Dixon from Hogan's Heroes was in that.  How about that?  Joe, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show with Mario Canto.  Oh, and hey.  How you doing, fellas? 
[01:40:30]  Doing all right.  Doing all right.  Hey, Mario.  Hey, Joe.  What are you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm good.  What are you doing?  Listen, stop trying to talk like me, first of all.  You know...  Hey.  You know you remind me of that pal?  Oh.  You remind me of Julia Child on frigging Coke.  No, she did the Coke.  I can do Julia Child on Coke.  This is a lovely souffle that we're doing, and we're going to just bake it in an oven  at 350 degrees, and then we're going to take it out, and you don't want to shake the  oven because it could fall, and then it won't be good.  And then we're going to do...  We're going to do a nice cheese souffle, too, to go with the chocolate souffle, and then 
[01:41:00]  we're going to do stuff for turkey.  Someone looks like she fell over the years.  You see it now?  Her neck is coming out of her breast.  And, yeah, her neck comes right out of her cleavage, and her boobs are down to I don't  know where.  She's Miss Chokes on Dick.  Yeah, yeah.  Miss Chokes on Dick from South Park.  Yeah, she is.  She's got the big hunch.  She's like Quasimodo cookie.  She is very, yeah.  She's still like the Sasquatch footage from 1967 when the guy fell off the horse.  In California, yeah, that's what she's been like. 
[01:41:30]  But she's a great chef, and she was the first to do it.  But they don't even trust her with the sauce anymore.  She has to stand by and watch.  She doesn't cook anymore.  She watches.  She just watches.  And she's like, that's lovely.  She wants to get her hands in there.  It doesn't seem to be more and nodding long enough.  More and nod.  When Martha Stewart was on, she made a big Christmas tree made out of sticky balls.  If hers was nice and straight, mine looked like the leaning tower of Pisa.  It's always funny when she'd be like, now roll the dough into balls. 
[01:42:00]  Take your balls and roll them in your hand.  Roll the balls in your hand.  Did you know that my hump is a block of Pecorino Romano?  I could grate it onto your pasture if you'd like.  Oh, that's good.  That would be convenient.  Yeah, I don't care what.  David, what's up?  David.  David?  Question for Mario.  What's up, man?  What is your obsession with all these old films like this?  I love old films. 
[01:42:30]  Have some culture.  Have some culture, David.  David, there's a great Joan Crawford movie where she's obsessed with a guy named David.  And she searches the streets for him.  And it was the first film ever about a schizophrenic.  And the opening scene is her walking along going, I'm looking for David.  And this bus pulls up and the door opens and she goes, is David on this bus?  Mario, I saw you one time at Jimmy's Comedy Club.  You were working as the emcee many, many years ago.  Where?  Jimmy's Comedy Club in Bayside. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, that must have been about 9,000 years ago.  Because you know I don't leave this island anymore.  Well, once upon a time.  Once upon a time.  Wow, that's a long time ago.  Yeah.  All right, David.  Thank you.  Good luck.  David, I'm glad.  Thank you.  That's Jimmy's.  I only put Jimmy's on my ice cream cone.  What movie was that?  The David movie?  Possessed.  Possessed.  He did two movies called Possessed.  There were two completely different movies.  One was pre-co with the movie.  She was a hooker being kept by Clark Gable.  She's the most masculine man I've ever known.  He was the king. 
[01:43:30]  He had balls.  She said that on David.  Was that before the snake bit?  I think Olivia de Havilland.  Olivia de Havilland.  That was before.  Oh, that was a good one.  But the second Possessed was around the same time as Snake Pit.  You ever see the Snake Pit?  Oh, a woman goes in a loony van.  We're going to put Opie in a room.  You're not going to Greece.  You're going to go in a room and just like, you know.  You know when I saw all these movies?  It was years ago on the old Channel 5 here in New York.  You mean Bowling for Dollars?  It was, yeah. 
[01:44:00]  The same channel.  Dialing for Dollars?  Those movies?  Yeah.  And you'd watch it, you know.  No, the million dollar movie.  On Channel 9, that was the million dollar movie.  But all those local channels, they play all these ancient black and white movies.  They're great, too.  They're great films.  The Bad Seed.  Did you ever see The Bad Seed?  I love him.  I love him because he's just innocent and pure.  I watch Caddyshack once a week.  I like that film.  See, I have a real cross culture.  I love that stuff.  But then I love the Scorsese stuff. 
[01:44:30]  Sit down, Danny.  Did you see American Pie 2?  Not yet, no.  It's very, very, very funny.  It is.  Very, very funny.  Yeah, it's really funny.  I loved it.  I thought it was pretty great.  Well, I was waiting to get a lousy review from you.  I loved it.  No, I loved it.  I think it's really funny.  I laughed a lot.  And, you know, I like my toilet humor.  Don't.  No.  Don't forget to bring a towel.  Mario.  Yes.  Please, just do one guy imitation.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Could you do Stone Cold for me? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  I really do.  Yeah, Stone Cold.  Maybe Stone Cold.  Do you do any male?  Yes, I do.  I do.  I do a little Brando.  No, no.  Who does great?  Oh, well, I'm sorry.  I didn't.  Go ahead.  What thing?  The Mario.  The Carmen.  I don't know.  The Carmen.  My balls, son of a bitch.  Mario.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Please do Brando.  Can you please read some of that as Brando?  That's my favorite article ever.  I've heard of the Patricia Biles for us.  It's going to be publishing a biography.  It's going to be my Viking called Marlon Brando. 
[01:45:30]  It's about me.  And let me just tell you that when I was quoted about Hollywood, they start by seducing me.  And these producers, they're stupid pricks.  You know, I'll take my money and that's it.  And, you know, there's certain films, you know, some of these films I've done, they make as much sense as a rat screwing a grapefruit. 
[01:46:00]  You know, you see, these cookies are made of salicornia, which is a tree that grows salicornia.  And if you eat it, you won't get fat.  It's a good thing.  Can I get a ring ding, please?  Is Opie going to finish that blueberry muffin?  Because, you know, I'm balding.  I'm middle-aged. 
[01:46:30]  I'm a failure.  I've tried everything.  Squirreling, smoking, drinking, eating salicornia, working.  Not a little mean anything.  I want God to hit me in the head and say, wake the hell up, Mr. Brando.  Stop.  Is that a Yodel over there?  Can I get that Yodel?  Could you bring me that Yodel?  Because I like the thing.  You know what I like about the Yodos?  They twirl.  They have that nice little curl in the cream in the middle. 
[01:47:00]  I like the cream.  I like cream.  I like cream in the middle of things.  I like cream coming out of things.  I like cream going into things.  I like cream.  But salicornia is a weed that grows.  And you can make paper out of it.  You can make clothes out of it.  And you can...  This is what he does.  He goes on talk shows and just rambles.  But you know what?  If you really follow him, he makes sense.  Get out of here.  It does have a through line.  Believe it or not.  I think he's brilliant.  He's the greatest.  He's the best.  He's the best out of the soul metal.  They got Sonny on the causeway. 
[01:47:30]  I like...  Okay.  Wait.  Did you ever see Streetcar Named Desire?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Opie.  Awesome.  Kiss me on the mouth like a woman.  Sweet.  No.  Okay.  Streetcar Named Desire is great because you got...  I got an open mind, but that's a little too open.  I know.  No.  Okay.  I won't kiss you.  I don't want to scare you off.  All right.  You want to make out or something?  That's right.  I do want to make out with Opie.  He's here.  He's...  You know, I told you.  Opie's got this whole new contract and whole new look going on. 
[01:48:00]  He's looking pretty good.  Get your balls up.  No.  Okay.  Shut the Brando frigging...  No.  Get a little Streetcar Named Desire music.  Vivian Leigh, Marlon Brando, and she was like...  When he was like, there's a thing on the wall that's called a Napoleonic Code.  What belongs to the wife belongs to the husband and vice versa.  And then Vivian Leigh goes, Ma, but you have an impressive judicial ill.  Could I have a line of yours here?  Could you button me up, Stanley?  See, I can do the woman and the man, so kiss my ass. 
[01:48:30]  And I don't care.  I know I do more women.  I don't have to prove myself.  Right.  Kiss my ass.  I'm more talented than Cindy Adams.  Katie, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  Mario, just to let you know, I'll be there on Sunday at Caroline's.  You know...  I'm going to find cheering you on.  What's your name?  Katie.  Katie.  Katie.  Just like my name, Katie.  I like that.  A girl named Katie.  The women come out to see me in droves, and I love you for it, and I appreciate it. 
[01:49:00]  Really?  I enjoy it.  Let me tell you, you were fantastic on Sex and the City.  Thank you very much.  I loved you in Sex and the City.  I got a new one.  You really made my...  That was the day.  When I saw you, you really made my night, because I was having a really crappy day.  That's great.  I'm going back on in January.  They're saving the last six for January, so I'm on the second one.  Yeah, they did the summer finale, but it's really not the season finale.  The season finale.  They're saving the last six for January, and I'm on the second one there.  What was your character?  I play Anthony Marantino, who was for... 
[01:49:30]  Go ahead, laugh.  He was the wedding stylist for Christian Davis' character, Charlotte, and I'm picking on  her wedding dress, and the wedding woman's like, look at this beautiful one, and she  doesn't mind.  I'm like, she hates it!  That's all I can say.  She hates it!  So, and then, I was on the season premiere this year, and they tried to fix me up with  the bald guy, Sanford, who was played by Willie Gerson, and it's a disastrous fix-up.  She tells me he looks like Ed Harris, and then I meet him, and he's like, I'm like, yeah. 
[01:50:00]  Like Ed Asner.  Try Ed, I have no Harris.  And it's a great episode.  It was a great episode.  It's a great show.  I'm very...  Ooh!  Saucy!  Saucy!  Don't get fussy with me, Bernice.  I wasn't able to get into that show, though.  Oh, it's a great show.  I know you think it's a good show.  I have...  Last night, I did a gig at...  I did an evening at the Sag Harbor Theater, Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, Hamptons,  and Kim Cattrall was there, Alec Baldwin was there, and Christian Davis was there last 
[01:50:30]  night, so that was pretty cool.  Are you taking requests?  I don't know if this will work.  Let's just try.  What?  Vito.  Hey, Mario.  What, Vito?  What's up, buddy?  What are you doing, Vito?  Hey, how you going?  I love that name.  How you doing?  That's a good name, Vito.  Yeah.  As long as you don't kiss me on the list.  I'm going to kiss you on the list.  You can tell me, but don't kiss me.  No, I'm coming over there, Vito.  I'm going to kiss you when you call.  Could you imagine that?  You made a guy like this.  How you doing?  You know what?  I think you're really high.  I want to kiss you on the mouth.  Come on.  Pull down your pants.  Let me see.  Come on.  Show it to me.  Let me see. 
[01:51:00]  Let me see.  You know, there's a few homos like that, believe it or not.  Yeah?  Yeah, there's a few.  Get your balls out.  What?  Alisha, I got a request.  African queen.  That's really funny.  I want the boat scene.  Okay, wait.  I don't know the exact dialogue, so I'm just going to have to make it up.  You can make it up.  I will.  Oh.  Watch out for that.  Watch out for that big rolling rapids over there.  We're going to tip the boat up.  Shut the hell up, bitch.  I know what I'm doing. 
[01:51:30]  I know how to steer this goddamn boat.  Send your bag to the boat, son of a bitch.  Just shut your big ass.  You son of a bitch.  Don't you dare.  Don't you dare tell me to shut up.  You don't know how to row a boat to save your life.  What the hell?  Shut that up, bitch.  I'll kick you.  All right.  That's enough of that.  That's what I would want to say.  That's good.  All right.  That wasn't too bad.  If I knew the dialogue more, it would have been better.  I apologize.  And there goes Vito.  Well, Vito, you know, I knew people in the mafia named Vito, but I know that Vito was really 
[01:52:00]  legitimate.  Let's go to Jack.  Jack, what's up, man?  Jack.  Hey, Jack.  Hey.  What's up?  Yo.  Yo, Jack.  Jack?  How you guys doing?  We're hanging with Mario Cantone.  He's playing Carolines in the City Sunday.  Hey, Jack.  Yo.  Yo.  Why don't you do a little Brett Summers, Charles Nelson Raleigh while you guys are there?  Brett Summers.  That's really funny.  I don't do it, but I do do a little.  Oh.  These.  Oh.  Big banana and crayons.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:52:30]  Remember he used to do the big banana and crayons?  You two.  Oh, my God.  The big banana.  Oh.  These.  Oh.  Oh.  I just remember him.  I said.  How's that for a chopper?  That's from Lidsville.  Lidsville.  Awesome.  How's that for a chopper?  Oh.  Mrs. Muir.  He hated doing that show.  Oh.  He hated it.  He used to walk off the set, supposedly.  Really?  Just like you on Steam Pipe Out?  That's right.  I walked off the set because it wasn't at 58 degrees and those little monsters were chewing 
[01:53:00]  at my legs.  Was that just in New York?  Yeah.  Well, it was on, it was actually at the time, Channel 9 went across the country to about  150 markets.  Oh, right.  It was like the first try in a super station.  It was like a little, it was a, they called it a passive super station.  Yeah.  Which made it like a screwing up the ass.  Which made it was a bottom.  So, Mario did, for people outside of New York, a few years back, did a kid's show.  Yeah, five years.  On Steam Pipe Alley.  And you'd watch, and I swear, I didn't know you at all back then, but I'd watch and go, 
[01:53:30]  this guy cannot like sitting there with these goddamn kids.  I told him, I said, get back, you are merely props to me.  And you do like impressions of everybody that you do here on the show.  And the kids are like, looking at you like deer in headlights.  Had no idea.  It was unbelievable.  And I would slide down that pole every Sunday, which was my idea, by the way.  Insert joke here.  Excuse me.  Yeah, really.  That was my idea.  Go ahead.  Give it to me.  I deserve it. 
[01:54:00]  And I would do my little opening monologue to the kids.  They had no idea.  And then I would do these sketches.  And then the obstacle, we had the Mommy Dearest Obstacle course every Mother's Day.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  The Mommy Dearest Obstacle course.  Yeah, we did.  We did that.  What were some of the things they had to do?  Well, they had to, you know, take all the wire hangers off the bed, go into the trash, get the raw meat, put it on the plate.  And like these kids knew what the hell was going on.  And I was like, no.  And I would do it like, and now you have to get all the presents and throw it over to the orphanage and keep one for yourself. 
[01:54:30]  Go through the living room.  Say hello to Barbara Bennett from Red Book.  Barbara, please.  Go to the toilet paper.  Scrub the toilet seat and scrub the bathroom floor.  And then it was like.  And you know what?  I would get pissed off.  I'm starting to remember this.  I would get pissed off watching because the kid would clearly not win on time.  I would let them win.  And you'd go, yeah, you won, you won.  I'm like, Mario.  The kid would.  I know.  He didn't even cross the line.  The clock's been at zero for 10 seconds.  That's true.  I always let them win.  I couldn't bear the fact that they lost.  Chrissy.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up? 
[01:55:00]  I used to love watching Mario on Steamside Valley.  Oh, Chrissy.  See the tricks.  I was a little kid.  I used to love it.  I used to beg my mom if I could go on.  Did you come on?  You didn't come on there, Chrissy?  No.  Oh, I know.  I'm from Philly, so, you know, we never made the trip up to New York.  The ladies are so good to me.  The gals.  Thanks, Chrissy.  There's a guy on the line.  He's saying that he won the obstacle course.  Jesus.  All right, put him on.  Jim.  Oh, hey.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Jim.  Mario, I was on your show.  It was the first one taped in 1990. 
[01:55:30]  My God, I still have the videotape copy of it.  It was the first one taped in 1990.  You did this god-awful sketch of the hunchback in Notre Dame pulling on the bell.  God, yes, I remember it.  He was the hunchback, like, trying to get a job, and he was like a stenographer.  You had to do it, like, for an hour, going over and over the sketch.  It was, oh, were you like that?  Oh, my God.  Cut to it again!  Well, you know, when children were working with me, they were unprofessional, untalented children.  Mario, listen, you had this musical chairs game, right? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, we'd pump the gas, yeah.  You ate the beams, you're pumping the gas.  You ate the beams, you're pumping the gas.  I was Luciano Pavarotti, and they played musical chairs with whoopee cushions, and the whole  thing was, I ate the beams, I'm pumping the gas.  It was so ridiculous.  This 200-pound kid named Chris won it.  He won it?  This 200-pound kid named Chris, he pushed his little girl off the final chair, and he won  it.  And he won it?  And I really...  Dude, wait a minute.  You have a tape of this?  I have a tape of it, yes.  Dude, what was the theme of the obstacle course that you did?  It was, okay, I had to mix up some Chinese food. 
[01:56:30]  Because I had to leave an oil slick underneath a bed.  I had to find a cheese in a garbage can and give it to Heidi.  What was the theme?  That sounds like some...  That's not a theme.  Well, maybe we didn't have a theme.  Oh, Around the World in 80 Days.  Oh, that's what it was.  Around the World in 80 Days.  Yes, and I did my David Niven impression.  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  No, I actually didn't.  I didn't do David Niven.  Dude, you've got to get us this tape, because I would love to get some sound clips of Mario  off of this.  I'll kill you all.  I will come bombed. 
[01:57:00]  I don't care.  No, no, you're fine.  But I'm glad you were on the show, and I'm glad you won.  Did you legitimately win, or did I let you win?  No, I had 21 seconds left in the class.  Right on, baby.  I was the record holder for the best of time.  Yes, sure.  Because Anthony said that I let a lot of kids win, which I did, because I don't want you  to lose, but you did win, legitimately.  Good for you.  Yeah, I won a Head Start Explorer computer.  Wow.  They were the worst games.  We gave away the worst games in the country.  And I won three Nintendo games by Tengen.  Hey, sweet.  I love the Tengen. 
[01:57:30]  You ever meet Bob McAllister in Mario when you were doing that?  Bye, Jim.  Thank you.  You never claimed that you were ripping him off or nothing?  He was New York, right?  What was he on?  Wonder?  He was Wonderama on Channel 5.  That was here.  We didn't get that.  We had stuff like Romperum Bozo in Boston.  Rex Traylor, who now owns Travel Age.  Zoom.  Zoom.  But Zoom was pretty national, even though it wasn't in Boston.  But Boomtown, Major Mud was another one.  This astronaut.  Oh, we had the most ridiculous.  We had a really ridiculous game. 
[01:58:00]  What was the Wonderama thing?  Kids are people, too.  Wack-a-doo.  Wack-a-doo.  Wack-a-doo.  That stunk.  We read some stories about Bob McAllister after he died.  He finally just died a few years back.  Did he die?  Yeah, lung cancer.  The guy was smoking like crazy.  He would smoke between the taping segments.  His kids are coming up to him, and he's blowing smoke in the face, like, get away from me.  He was the most miserable son of a bitch.  He didn't like kids.  I like kids, but then again, I don't like kids.  You know, it's like people.  You like some, you don't like some. 
[01:58:30]  And you don't want to work with them like that.  You know, I would, after each take, I'm always nice to the kids.  I would sign autographs, but after each take, I would go into the control room, and I'd be like,  keep them out of the control room, out of control.  And at the beginning, they used to come in classes, so they were all friends, and they went insane together.  So then, when it was individual, you'd rev them up on ice cream and stuff?  No, they would be, like, out of control.  I wanted to get a wire hanger and do some whipping, but I didn't.  But then, after a while, it was people who would send them tickets, and it was people,  the kids that didn't know each other, so they weren't as rowdy. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  When they were class, it was like, go to the Museum of National History.  Get out of here.  Joe, what's up?  You're next.  Hey, Joe.  Joe.  Joe, or whatever.  Joe.  Joe.  Tommy, what's up, man?  Tommy, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Mario, I've got to be honest with you, man.  Growing up, me and my brother hated you.  And?  Oh, no, but now I listen to you in 018, and me and my brother, you crack us up, man.  I'm glad that you turned around, Tommy.  That's great.  I've got to take a lot of marijuana, but, I mean, growing up, I'd be like, dude, how annoying 
[01:59:30]  is this guy?  But now, like, Judy, all impressions.  I live with my gay uncle, bro, and two of us who just laugh.  Well, I've never in my life ever heard a Judy gone impression like you do.  Oh, thank you.  You crack me up, man.  You know what?  You know what it does to me to hear that from a guy like that, from, like, this straight guy?  Hey.  I think that's the most, that, that, that, that does it all for me.  I sound like Pat Cooper now.  That's the best.  That does it all for me.  It does.  It does.  It does.  Tommy, thank you, buddy. 
[02:00:00]  Tell your brother I said hello.  Thanks, man.  And your gay uncle.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Mario Cantone in the studio.  Do you remember this, Mario?  Very quickly, I was picked from the audience to be young Mario Cantone, and you had me introduce cartoons.  Did you used to pick out a young Mario Cantone?  There was no young Mario Cantone, just like there was no young Betty Davis.  We were always an old soul.  No.  There was one kid on the show, though, named Steve Monteford that used to play my son in a sketch when I used to do Angelo, the tough guy.  And, see, another guy. 
[02:00:30]  Thank you very much that I do.  And I can butch it up with the best of them.  I can fool you all.  And I have more women coming to see me than any of you know.  But, unfortunately.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Call an ambulance.  Ooh.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got to.  Hey.  Hey.  Mario Cantone playing Carolines this Sunday.  We highly recommend you go see him.  I'm staying.  You'll laugh your yam back.  Hell yeah.  I'm not going.  I know.  I know.  We're just saying, you know, giving you a little plug there.

[02:02:30]  Some.  I told you I like the cold one.  Is that what they're called?  How about that?  I don't even know.  I like the cold one.  It's no Celine Dion, I understand, but.  She blows.  I hate her.  Celine.  Oh, she's ridiculous.  She hits her chest like she's pumping her pacemaker.  She's, I love my husband.  I don't, I'm not a big fan of her.  Husband.  Okay, can we talk?  What was the last, uh, the last CD you bought? 
[02:03:00]  I'm digging the room.  And Renee.  The last CD I bought, uh, the last, well, there's a couple of them that I'm not, Alicia  Keys, that new girl, Alicia Keys, the blacker.  A lot of people are digging her.  Hey, she's hot.  She's all right.  A lot of people are digging her.  She's good.  She's good.  She's a little young.  Yeah.  Um, she's good.  Uh, the, the one, there's, there's a group called Lucy Pearl, R&B group, the, the girl  that left En Vogue, um, uh, the, one guy from Tribe Called Quest.  Isn't she in Destiny's Child, though?  No, no, no, no.  No, see, you're mixing them all up.  And then this kid from Tony, Tony, Tony, Lucy Pearl, that came out in January of 2000. 
[02:03:30]  I don't know how I missed it.  Saw the video in Amsterdam.  I went, they're awesome.  I got the CD and I love it.  And then I also got Bilal, who I think is a nice voice, but I'm not crazy about the material.  And Mariah Carey had her nervous breakdown because she saw a screening of her new motion  picture, Glitter.  Uh-oh.  I can't wait to see that movie.  I am going first day because I need the material.  I can't wait.  What made her think she could act?  She can't act. 
[02:04:00]  She's conquered everything.  Do you, you don't think it was authentic in that video when she was on the roller coaster?  I would really think she was on a roller coaster.  Oh, wait.  She was on a roller coaster.  What do I know?  She can't even act in a video.  No.  You know, she.  Why is she trying to act when she will only show the right side of her face?  Is that true?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  She only, that's a big thing with Mariah Carey.  Why is she dressing like a hooker?  She will never let you take a shot of the left side of her face.  Mariah Carey?  Yep.  Why is she dressing like a hooker?  She could be a classy young lady.  Because she knows.  Because she just got, she got the breast implants and she wants to show them off. 
[02:04:30]  She's ridiculous.  She was, uh.  She could be a class act and she's ruined herself and she had a nervous breakdown because  she wants to do movies and the two that are coming out, the word is they're hellacious  and she's.  Mariah, do you find her hot though?  I don't.  Oh, yeah.  And a skanky sort of way?  Yeah, I do.  I really want to like, you know what I want to do?  Let's talk like guys for a minute.  Okay.  Oh, let's do that.  Come on.  Let's do it.  But I can't be, like, I don't like the way she's changing or anything like that.  Like, I don't buy her albums or nothing like that.  But I want to take her.  I want to like open her up.  I want to change her.  I want to plow her until next Tuesday like the Amish plow the fields. 
[02:05:00]  I want to like, I want to do her like there's no tomorrow.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the H, fellas.  The H.  When they put the word dot in front of that, I was like, that's genius.  Mariah, yeah, she lost her mind.  And did you see the picture they had of her?  And, you know, every lunatic, everybody that loses their mind, it looks kind of cool.  Like, you get to hang around in your PJs all day.  She was in her pajamas just sitting around.  It doesn't seem like that bad a life. 
[02:05:30]  Shut this up.  And I hear you kiss alone.  It's a place to carry on.  And you move.  Do you know what she sings?  Look at her eyes.  She's very unfocused.  They flash like Frank Vangelis.  And she can't.  And she looks like there's the fear of God in her eyes.  She's horrified when people say.  Nice.  You look at her and her eyes are all over the place. 
[02:06:00]  When I first heard Vision of Love, I was like, who is this girl?  She can say.  Then I heard her sing it live.  It was like, what happened?  There's no connection.  She's not emotionally connected.  Whitney Houston, on her worst day, blows her away.  Oh, well, there's somebody who's a little screwy in the head right there.  Let me tell you something.  Whitney Houston.  The Bobby Brown guy.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I love my Whitney Houston.  I think she's so talented.  She's not a bad actor.  She's a pretty decent actress.  She doesn't embarrass herself as an actress.  She's not, you know. 
[02:06:30]  She embarrasses herself in real life.  Well, you know.  With that Bobby Brown.  You know what my sister said?  Hey, I'd like to do her.  Me too.  I would like to take her.  I would like to do Whitney Houston.  I really would.  You know, I'd like to do Bobby Brown too, maybe one day.  I'm sure you would.  This is my guy.  I would.  I think he's kind of sweet.  You know, he's a little bloated and retaining lately.  The Bobby Brown.  Yeah, the Bobby Brown's a little bloated.  Let me tell you something.  Bobby Brown in his day, if he, I don't know what his problem is, but he, I saw him.  I think it's a lot of drugs.  No, wait.  Whenever I saw him on that first album tour, his second album, my brother, he was thrilling. 
[02:07:00]  He was one of the most thrilling live male performers I've ever seen in my life.  So was MC Hammer.  Shit.  No, I never liked MC Hammer.  Hammer time.  Oh, he was ridiculous.  With his Aladdin pants.  You didn't like that when he spun around and his pants went out?  Oh, he was, he should have passed.  He looked like a flying squirrel.  Ah, Finlay.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Mario, how you doing?  How are you, Finlay?  I used to work in this place called Christopher's, Marine Park, Brooklyn. 
[02:07:30]  Mario, I don't know if you remember that place?  Christopher's, a Marine?  No, I don't.  You played it once or twice?  I did.  I was working there, and they were like, you know, we were discussing who was coming  in for the night, and they were like, Mario Cantone's coming in.  I'm like, Mario Cantone, the Steampipe Alley guy?  Oh, God.  And everyone was thinking the same thing.  They're like, Steamp, what is he going to do here?  Mario came in and killed.  The place was hysterical.  Yeah.  Nobody could believe how raunchy he was.  Yeah.  It was like, wait a minute, this guy used to hang around with kids.  Yeah.  Yeah, he kills on stage.  It's like Caroline Sunday, man.  He was awesome. 
[02:08:00]  Well, thank you.  I guess you're going to go fast.  I'm telling you.  I got one other thing, though.  Go ahead, man.  I'm a New York City fireman.  You are?  We were ordered not to put WOW stickers on our rigs.  I want you, like, to put out there to all the girls out there that they are allowed  to flash us.  Just because we don't have the WOW sticker doesn't mean we're not listeners.  Almost every fireman I know listens to us.  How about this?  You WOW stickers, but we're also putting another sticker out that means WOW.  It's called Keep Back 200 Feet.  There's that one.  That's a new WOW sticker. 
[02:08:30]  Excellent.  Can I just say one more thing before you go?  New York fireman rule.  Thanks, man.  Rule.  Thanks.  All right, calm down.  Can I just say one more thing?  Shut up.  I love them.  Okay, wait.  I don't mean to sound like...  Shut up.  Did you ever see...  Did you buy the calendar?  Shut up.  Christopher...  Shut up.  I will.  Christopher Lowell.  Christopher Lowell.  You know Christopher Lowell, the gay guy, the gay interior designer who gives gay  men a bad name?  Oh, my God.  That guy.  He's the worst interior designer in the world.  We love the guy, though.  He's hilarious.  He's uber gay. 
[02:09:00]  Didn't he retire?  No.  He had his last show, I thought.  Get out of here.  He did.  All I know is he had a fireman on one time, and he was like, so, what's it like to be  a hunk on a fireman's calendar?  And then the guy was horrified, and then he was like, okay, we're going to make seat  cushions today, and you can carry them around with you all the time.  You take some corks, and you staple them to your ass, and then you take some upholstery  and some cushion, and you push that in, and then you upholstery it, and you staple  it, and it's permanently straight to your ass, and you can just carry it around all day.  He's ridiculous.  The best one I ever saw him, because we used to watch that all the time. 
[02:09:30]  It was on before I had to leave to come in to work.  Was it the sailor one?  Yeah.  He goes, today, we are doing a nautical motif.  And then he walks in the room, and it's all nautical.  He goes, permission to come aboard.  What?  I lost my mind.  I lost my mind.  Like, this is the funniest guy.  And then he'd get the guys in there like other interior decorators, but sometimes he'd  get, like, a carpenter would come on to discuss that.  And it's like, uh, yeah, like, macho guys.  Oh, yeah.  He's got his tool belt on.  And he's looking at this guy like, oh, my God. 
[02:10:00]  Unbelievable.  This is the gayest human being on the face of the earth.  It's the best juxtaposition I'll tell him.  Yeah, yeah.  When that fireman was on, he had, like, a whole fireman birthday party thing.  And he was like, okay, we're going to have a little fireman with a truck in the middle  of the cake with a ladder that goes all the way up to the candles.  It was like, what?  And the fireman was horrified.  He's like, what's it like to be a hunk on a fireman's calendar?  He was like, yeah, it's all right.  It's good.  We would watch it.  I like your hose.  Yeah, bags off.  He's making window treatments out of, like, old supermarket bags.  And you know something? 
[02:10:30]  It looked great.  See, that's because you're straight.  He's the worst interior designer in the world.  He's so bad.  He can't do it.  Oh, God.  He can't do it.  He's so, it's embarrassing.  You know what's so funny?  I didn't get that, Gene.  I'm a bad.  I can't.  Really?  You know, some people are going to be like, poof, throw a pillow.  It's great.  I can't.  I'm like, put the pictures on the floor.  We'll put them on the wall.  How about the people that would take a picture of the room?  And then he would put the picture up on the screen.  And with, like, a telestrator, he'd go, I'd go with some blue curtains here. 
[02:11:00]  And it would look like a bad Winky Dink episode.  You couldn't possibly tell.  Winky Dink, Reverend.  Nice.  You couldn't possibly tell what it would look like.  It looked like a kid drew on a picture.  That's classic.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, I got some Wonderama clips for you.  You do?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  All right.  Hold on one quick second here.  Just tell me if this thing is overmodulated or not.  Okay?  Hold on.  All right.  Here it comes. 
[02:11:30]  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Good news.  One, two, three.  All right.  I lost my teeth.  I lost my teeth.  You did, yes.  On Monday, I got a trophy.  Oh, that's the one.  Safety poster content.  Sorry.  Great.  Yeah.  I got a new bike.  I got a new bike. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, man.  I'll have to read it.  Oh, this is bad memories.  All right, Dan.  Dan, we got it.  All right, Dan.  Dan, we got it.  Thank you, Dan.  You're taking me back to a very bad place.  You know what this was?  He would go around.  He'd sing the song, go to the kids in the audience, and ask them what the good news was.  And here's these kids all hopped up on chocolate and ice cream, looking like they're doing the pee-pee dance, you know?  They got to go.  And they got their hands up to be picked.  And he'd come over, and 90% of them would go, I don't know. 
[02:12:30]  I'm on Dorama.  But we got this.  Ow!  Oh!  Ow!  Come on!  David, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  David.  Hey, man.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  We're having fun with Mario Cantone.  Now, you've got to remember this guy, the stoner man himself, Bob Ross.  Of course.  Of course.  He died, didn't he?  Yes.  He died of cancer.  I died of a happy little tumor.  But everybody needs a friend. 
[02:13:00]  It was right about here in my liver, is where that was.  Right about here.  I remember him, yeah.  All of a sudden, my healthy pink lungs, which I'm taking a little pink, I mix some liserine crimson  in with some white and make healthy pink lungs.  And I put them right about here.  But look, here comes ugly Mr. Cancer.  I'm going to dip right into the black and just put some nice tumors all over my lungs.  There they go.  And now I'm going to take some of this green, mix it up with the yellow, and look what I'm  hacking up now.  This is a color I don't even have on my palate. 
[02:13:30]  It's Bob Ross.  He did.  He had the big afro.  Yeah.  And he would talk about, I remember he would talk about happy things.  Because, and one time, because he's always mellow, he would go, and I paint happy things  now because I was in Vietnam.  I saw a lot of bad things over there.  He did.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm just like, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  If you look in that bush I'm painting there, look, you can see one of those hiney hats  in the B.C.  Right about there.  That's it.  I'm going to go in with a flamethrower in this little cave and burn out every little 
[02:14:00]  dink I could find, and, oh, maybe I shouldn't be saying this.  Okay.  We'll just paint happy things like a rabbit.  Linda.  B.C.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  So they'd have the energy to kill my buddies.  Hi, Linda.  Where'd she go?  Hi, Linda.  I just want to tell you, I love you.  It's not the funniest thing you ever saw.  Linda.  If you ever want to switch teams, honey, call me up.  See?  Look at this. 
[02:14:30]  See?  Thank you, Linda.  Boy.  I'm stating your love.  I love you.  You're hysterical.  Ah, thank you, Linda.  Well, we never get calls from guys like that.  Hey, you ever want to switch teams?  Let me tell you something.  Believe me, there's a few that would call you.  What would it take?  What would it take, Mario?  To what?  You know, to have me with a woman?  Well, let me tell you.  We got some NSYNC tickets.  This is my NSYNC.  We had a gay Marco.  Oh, gay Marco came in.  Come in, never even touched a woman, never made out one, nothing.  Didn't even know what kind of body parts she had, for the most part. 
[02:15:00]  Who's gay Marco?  He's a...  Gay Marco's a guy who comes on the show.  Oh, okay.  Yes, yes, yes.  I thought you was.  I was like, he's not an NSYNC guy.  We love the gay Marco.  Is that the new NSYNC guy?  No, he wanted the NSYNC ticket so bad.  So we said, look, if you have, let's just say, oral with a woman for the entire NSYNC song,  we'll give you the tics.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something right now.  Screams of horror that came out of him.  Yeah, well, let me tell you something.  Look, let me just say that there are more women that come to see me than any, anybody. 
[02:15:30]  And straight couples.  And straight guys come, too.  And very, there's not enough gay men that come see me.  Really?  And it's like, they don't come out to see me.  It's like, some do, but there's, I think Gay Pride Week, Carol, I thought that it was...  Because you're not doing gay jokes.  Because they don't like my sensibility.  Let me tell you something.  If I was a lip-syncing drag queen, they'd be out there in droves.  And it pisses me off.  Because when gay men do come see me, I always like, oh, thank you for coming out, boys.  I appreciate it.  They're like, where are the guys?  I'm like, I don't know. 
[02:16:00]  Where are the guys?  Where are the guys?  There would be a meat factory.  I'm like, let me...  I don't know where they are.  I wish they were coming to see me.  They're actually at my shows.  They're going to see Norton.  Yeah, well, they should, I make a plea to all the homos out there to come to Caroline's  and see me more.  The women come in droves.  And you know what?  Let me tell you something.  If I was great, the chicks that I would get...  The girls dig you, right?  I love, and I love women.  I just, you know, I can't do it.  I just can't do it. 
[02:16:30]  Here's Marco saying impossible when we put the challenge up to him.  Impossible!  Oh, my God!  There he is.  Yeah.  Marco goes, woo!  Woo!  Woo!  That's Marco too, right?  The ooh.  Why isn't Marco calling us?  And then Marco, hey.  Yeah, what is a Marco call?  Woo!  I'll tell you one thing, though.  That's a winner!  I, I, my, my best friend is a girl named Kim Sia who actually comes on stage with me  and we do this Judy Garland, Barbara Streisand thing.  Her Barbara Streisand's brilliant.  I've made out with her many times.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  I make out with her.  Anything there?  Nothing.  No, but I make out with her.  I mean, you know, we were at an Eric Bonet concert and we, like, just were making out.  And we were, like, drunk and making out.  You know, I love her.  She's got great lips.  She's a very sexy woman.  Yeah.  And, you know, I, you know, I love her.  She's my best friend.  That's disgusting.  No, it isn't disgusting.  I like...  Like, you could just go out and make out and just hang out and make out and have some fun.  You know...  Takes all the pressure off of the girls, see?  And also, you know, it confuses people.  We've got to get to this story before we get out of here. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, the testicle guy.  Yeah, we should take a break.  Man chops off testicle and job protest.  The story's next.  Hello, this is Joan Crawford.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.

They're a great awards ceremony.  Toadies.  Oh, Toadies.  Toadies.  A little band from Texas.  Yeah, I like them.  But you know, I love the Coldplay.  The Coldplay. 
[02:19:30]  Name this song.  What is it?  Possum Kingdom.  Possum Kingdom.  Possum Kingdom, you guys.  Don't forget to bring a child.  We're getting more requests, but I think we put our Godfather music away.  Are they what, Godfathers then?  Well, they got...  Here, I'll tell you.  We got to get the music queued up for you.  Hold on a minute here.  Then we'll get to the story about the guy chopping off his own testy couch.  Which, this guy wants you to do the Godfather smacking around Cartman. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  Can I smash it?  Can I speak to you, please?  And...  My parents, when they struck me...  My son.  Come here, my son, little piece of crap.  Come to me.  Sit down.  Your parents will ask to come.  My parents will ask me. 
[02:20:30]  Godfather.  Can I please?  Can I please sit on your lap?  All right.  So, I'm on my lap.  Ow.  You just pulled down to my knee.  Godfather.  You're my friend.  I really love you.  That son of a piece will ask me.  That piece of crap.  I kicked a square in the net.  My mom.  I walked into the room.  And you know what she had?  She had a big black man plowing her. 
[02:21:00]  She had a big black man plowing her.  She had a big black man plowing her.  And what did you do?  I tried to stop him.  I tried to push him out the bed.  Kick him in the balls.  And you know what happened?  His balls were so big.  They didn't even hurt him.  My son.  What do you want me to do about this?  I want to go kill that son of a bitch.  I want to kill my mother.  I want to be alone.  I hate everybody.  My son. 
[02:21:30]  Let go of the cat.  Stop plowing the cat.  Go with the cat.  Please.  Get that thing out of a cat's ass, please.  Ah, it feels good.  I like it.  Come here, pussy.  Sweet.  Pussy.  Bring it back, pussy.  Bring it back.  I'm taking it.  Bring it.  Ow.  Jesus Christ.  I can show all my face.  I think we're out of dumps.  Yeah, we probably had it dumps there.  Yeah, sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Sweet.  It's all gooey.  Bear racket. 
[02:22:00]  Bear racket.  That'll be really funny when we replay it with all the bleeps in it.  I know.  We're really sorry about that.  That's all right.  I get you guys in trouble.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to swear like that.  Mario Cantone in the studio playing Caroline's this Sunday.  Highly recommend you.  Ten o'clock show.  All right.  Man chops off testicle and job protest.  All right.  What?  Yeah, I don't even know what this is all about.  A Peruvian man.  Yes.  From Lima, Peru.  Yeah, it's real because it's on Reuters.  Roto-Reuters.  But last year he sliced off his penis? 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  Yeah, we'll get to it.  A Peruvian man who last year sliced off his penis to draw attention to his jobless plights  on Monday chopped off one of his testicles in front of the parliament building.  All right.  Who's getting that feeling in the undercarriage?  That tingle.  Ow.  All right.  Sliced off one of them.  One of them.  That's...  You've got to be a little more calculated to just get one.  Both of them, you could do it in one clean sweep.  If you're going to slice it, wouldn't you just get rid of all the junk? 
[02:23:00]  Ow.  No, but why would...  Read the next sentence.  Next sentence.  It's only going to hurt you, my friend.  I mean...  He says, I'm doing all this to protest my lousy situation.  Oh, God.  Eduardo Valiz, 36, told doctors after his dramatic stunt.  Well...  It's too bad we're not hurt in Peru.  We could offer this guy, you know, tool tickets.  Tool tickets.  Yeah, see?  Free a mule for tool tickets.  If only we had tool tickets and we were on the air there, we might have saved...  Cool.  Cool.  He said now he's a poorly paid laborer. 
[02:23:30]  He hacked off his penis last September outside Parliament after failing to meet the Congress  head to ask for work.  Oh, God.  What a subhuman.  It was successfully re-implanted.  It was?  They reattached his penis.  They did a jogging penis.  He bob it on him.  Yeah.  Yeah, on himself.  They found it, wiped it off, and put it back on.  You've got to know, with the doctors down there in Peru, it must just be a bang-up job 
[02:24:00]  they did down there.  You know, when John Wayne Bobbitt did it, I'm sure they had some pretty good surf to  just get the stapler out.  The old swing line.  You ever see that silver tape they put on a plane wing?  Yeah.  That's exactly what the problem was.  Just tape it?  Maybe duct tape?  Let's see.  Witnesses said Valise shouted at the door of Congress that he wanted to see the president,  Carlos Ferraro. 
[02:24:30]  Carlos Ferraro.  When he couldn't see him, he got out a sharp knife and cut off his testicle.  Sweet.  A policeman, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.  I bet you Carlos heard him calling and then probably getting his friends like,  I'm not going to come out, but watch this.  Watch what he does.  I remember this guy.  Firefighters rushed over to Valise, who was bleeding heavily,  and took him to the hospital,  where doctors said he suffered a traumatic castration of the right testicle. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  Go ahead.  He's a laborer.  Last year, he was asking for work.  This time, he wanted a pay raise,  because he says he earns a paltry wage.  Oh, paltry.  Paltry.  Um.  Fight some even.  Draw them in the air.  It's today. 
[02:25:30]  Despite his mutilation, a hospital spokesperson said,  Valise could still enjoy a normal sex life.  Yeah.  After a little healing.  If you're hacking off your testicle,  you're never going to have a normal sex life,  because you're a nut.  That's a great way to get laid, though.  If your wife is, like, not in the mood,  you just hold a knife.  If you don't swallow, it's coming off. 
[02:26:00]  Good boy.  Hey, see.  Ah, Lucky.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  Hey, Lucky.  Hey, this is the difference between a civilized country like ours and savages down there.  Here, if we're not paid well enough, we just steal from our employers.  Exactly.  A little pilfering.  That's all.  You don't have to go cutting off testicles.  That's right.  I would sing it instead of actually doing it.  I would sing it.  You know it was sweaty and dirty when he cut it off.  Oh, sweet.  Ow.  Yeah, cheese ball, you guys. 
[02:26:30]  Cheese nut ball.  Those are good parties.  Put them on crackers.  They're real good.  I love a cheese nut ball.  They're kind of pink and sweet.  Put nuts on them, and they're kind of smelly like cheese.  And they cut them in half.  And just slice it to see if it's going to work.  Because cheese nut ball doesn't hurt as much.  I'm in pain.  I'm just thinking about this.  Douchebag.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, why do you bastards always have to say stories like this for dinner time? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, sorry.  I just finished eating steak, and now you're talking about junk getting lopped off.  Lopped off.  At least you didn't have meatballs, man.  Oh.  Ma'am, can I have a cheese nut, please?  Sure, hon.  Let's go.  Dermis.  Dermis.  Dermis, yeah.  Dermis.  Dermis.  Dermis, yeah.  What the ook?  Oh, yeah, exactly, man.  What the ook?  We got some three friends came over from Ireland there to start a June on a student visa.  We're staying in Boston.  And since you boys come on WBCN in Boston, we've been listening to you every day, man. 
[02:27:30]  This stuff is just a business.  Unfortunately, we're going back in like three weekends.  There's no such radio like this would ever get played in Europe.  I tell you, man.  This is crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Car bombs, yes.  But this type of radio, nay.  Man, shooting your neighbor for being a Protestant, that's one thing, but...  Dermis.  Dermis.  Oook the Queen.  Oook the Queen!  That's just what I'm saying, man.  Oooker!  Are you in Southie? 
[02:28:00]  Pardon?  Are you in Southie?  No, no.  We're staying in Alistair in Boston.  Don't let us down in Southie.  We're just too Irish in order to come to the Southie.  Too Irish for Southie?  Too Irish for Southie?  No.  Crazy?  Crazy.  Never.  How many...  I love it.  How many beers have you had today?  Pardon?  How many beers today?  36, but I can't count past that number, sir.  We went to a St. Paddy's Day in Southie, me and Opie, and going home, it was like vomit  hopscotch down the street.  You are...  No, no.  What are you saying?  It was good.  That's normal, everyday behavior.  It's not one point in midday or something wrong. 
[02:28:30]  Everyday?  Dermis.  Southie in Boston is the place to be on St. Paddy's Day.  What are you doing in the USA?  Money for weapons?  Money for weapons.  That's exactly it.  We're trying to snuggle guns back in our bags.  I think we're going to get away with it.  The FBI aren't listening to this, because I could be in trouble.  No, it's not like we get people, they get police sent over to their house and have them  arrested.  Oh, wait.  Yes, that just happened.  Are you going to cut your testicle off if you can't play for Notre Dame?  If it means to bring a few guns home, maybe I could do it. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  All right.  Right there.  The Irish government, I'm not getting back into the country now.  I've got three weeks left over here.  They're just going to stop me at the border.  Nah, no one knows who you are.  Could you say that faster, sir?  Could I say it any faster?  No.  It's really hard to understand.  We've got like two words of that.  You like Guinness?  Do I like Guinness?  Of course I do.  Of course.  You like a black...  You like a good scone?  Scone.  You like Black 47?  Sure.  But I don't like those uken English muffins.  That's what I'm telling you, man.  With those nooks and crannies.  We'll hide. 
[02:29:30]  We'll hide in your nooks and crannies and blow your asses up.  You uken English muffin.  I'd hear a sweet poison stick is laughing here.  This is crazy.  Ukraquane.  Ukraquane.  Ukraquane.  Ukraquane.  That's exactly it.  Come on.  Thank you.  Yes.  All right.  Our new Irish friends, Darmus.  Give us a call from time to time.  Thanks, Darmus.  Okay.  Good luck.  Take care, gentlemen.  Good luck.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  That's a great accent, man. 
[02:30:00]  It is a great accent.  That's the best friggin' accent.  And look how kind he was.  Mary.  Cleaned.  What's up?  Hey, Mario.  I think you're awesome.  I have a question for you.  Sure.  Were you born gay or do you choose to be gay?  I never knew if guys are gay.  Are they born gay or they choose to be gay?  What do I think?  What do I honestly think?  What?  I think it's, well, I think people discover the difference.  Me?  I came out of the womb with a quarter on my neck singing Swanee.  So, do you know that I was actually born with a quarter on my neck, too? 
[02:30:30]  When I heard that, I was like, I was like, it's marvelous.  I'm going to sing a little Old Man River.  No, I was born.  I was born.  And you want to know something?  I was out when I was 12.  You were out of the closet at 12.  How did that happen?  Are you not saying?  No, it's about telling yourself.  It's about going, this is what I am.  This is how I am.  And then you can slowly tell a few friends and family members.  It's not about announcing it to the world.  Believe me.  You know what?  There are many people in this business that do keep it a secret and don't want to announce it to the world, which is fine. 
[02:31:00]  There's nothing wrong with that.  When they lie about it, that's a whole other thing.  That pissed me off.  At 12 years old, what happened?  You're 12 years old, and what did you do?  What did I do?  I mean, yeah, you know, what was the moment that all of a sudden you said, that's it, I'm gay?  No, I just knew.  I knew.  I knew when I, I knew, you know, it's not a choice, and you just, you know.  You just feel it.  When you were growing up, were you playing with Barbie dolls, or were you playing with Army men or cars?  Oh, it's too good.  They dumped out. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, too bad.  They dumped out of that.  Hey, Matt, you're the best, and I'm glad I got through.  Well, I'm glad.  Thanks for the question.  We're having sex with each other.  Man.  If you had mushrooms, would you sit on one?  Boy, this is getting deep today, huh?  Caroline.  Hey.  Or is it Carolyn?  It's Caroline, Brian.  Sweet Caroline.  Your time never seems so good.  Love on the rush.  Ain't no surprise. 
[02:32:00]  Neil, please sing the E.T. song.  Internet porn.  I spanked until the night became a brand new day.  Nice comb over.  Sorry, Caroline.  Oh, sorry.  Caroline.  Neil Diamond, always funny.  Good.  Good Neil Diamond, too.  What's up, Caroline?  I never thought that there would be an area of universal humor between Jim Norton and Mario  Cantone, but you guys found it.  I love Mario.  Very excellent.  We have no problems with Mario.  Hey.  Nor should you, but they just seem like such disparate types of humor. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, well, you know, when you respect each other, anything can mesh.  You know, we mesh.  We mesh.  I think it's the small-minded people that get their impressions of what we're about, what  you're about, and think that you can't just hang out and joke around and bullcrap together.  I have a, most of my, I have a posse of straight men that I hang out with. 
[02:33:00]  A lot of, I have.  They're a six-pack away from gay.  That's, they're, they're, you know what they are?  They're half a homos.  That's what Marco said.  My half a homos.  Didn't Marco say that?  That every straight guy is one six-pack away from a, yeah.  That's, well, well, my hairdresser said every, every straight guy is one beer away.  That, well.  I don't know about one beer.  And then Rick said, I don't know.  I also think, I'm, you know, and Rick's over there.  His sod is a pearl necklace. 
[02:33:30]  Let me tell you something, Rick.  You got that body on you.  You better stay away from 8th Avenue.  Good night, everybody.  Is he nicely built?  Is he strapping?  He's a great-looking kid.  Yeah, look at him.  He's like a little body.  He's a little fireplug.  Come on, everybody.  Come on, everybody.  Kick your ass.  Come here.  I'm going to kick your ass.  Come on, I'll wrestle anything.  I'll wrestle a fire hydrant.  I'll wrestle anybody.  Come on.  I'll use my name and plug in the same time.  Plug, plug, plug, Rick, plug, plug, plug, plug.  Caroline, you got anything else?  Yeah, also, I just wanted to let Anthony know. 
[02:34:00]  I think he was doing a Scottish accent to the Irish guy.  Well, they could all appreciate hating the queen.  Yeah.  Right?  That's a difference.  Still a great accent, though.  Hey, Caroline, where are we going to meet you?  You call the show a lot.  I've actually met, I met Rick.  And I actually said hello to Anthony one time at Bar 9.  Oh, cool.  Come on by and say hi to me.  Just tell them that we're having the affair, Caroline.  Tell them!  Okay, Mario.  Come on!  All right, Caroline.  Thank you.  Bye, darling.  Are you going to be at Bar 9 tonight? 
[02:34:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  All right.  We got to fly, right?  Bye.  Bye.  I'm going to be at Bar 6-9.  Uh, Travis.  Shut up, ya oon.  Travis, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  We're punching.  I like it.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Travis.  Hey, Travis.  Hey, man.  I was just going to let you guys know.  I can't hear the show.  I'm hearing the show three hours ago right now, but I just got to let you guys know that  the other cities love hearing about you guys tearing Boston up.  Oh, cool.  Isn't that funny?  Sacramento.  We need some loud stickers out in Sacramento, man. 
[02:35:00]  Sacramento is just listening to about, what, a half hour of our show so far?  Uh, no.  We're getting all four hours, but we got one.  No, no, no.  I mean, how much?  It doesn't come on until three out here.  Yeah, right now it's 3.30.  So I get to hear the first hour while I can still call you guys.  This guy just heard the first half hour of the show when we ripped a rock hole in our  old station in Boston AF and UA.  Yeah, yeah.  See, I didn't get to listen yesterday, but I was hearing about how you sent those guys  down there to F them up, man.  Oh, yeah.  Like, yeah, no doubt.  How's Sacramento digging the show, man? 
[02:35:30]  Uh, yeah, take it easy, guys.  Uh, he didn't answer me.  He doesn't want to.  Did you ask him for the show?  I said, how is it going?  Are people talking about it, or?  Man, there's a few people talking about it.  It seems like everybody's talking, but not enough people are listening, man.  Yeah, we'll get it.  We'll get there.  It takes time.  Did they find that killer?  Yeah, yeah, I'm supporting you guys, man.  I hollered everybody I know.  Let me tell you something.  My favorite syndication t-shirt.  K-X-O-A.  Yeah, and they say to accentuate the X.  They've got some X-Girl competition right now with some chicks getting naked on stage and whatnot,  so...  Did they find that killer yet? 
[02:36:00]  Huh?  Did they find that knife guy yet?  The knife guy?  Yeah, the guy that stabbed him.  Five people.  Oh, the Russian dude?  The lead story everywhere.  Yeah, like Nikolai or something like that.  No, they didn't find him yet, man.  And they're looking hard, though.  He killed, like...  Five.  He killed, like, his...  Five people.  His whole family.  His whole family.  His, like, two of his nieces or something like that.  Nieces.  Like, little eight- and ten-year-old girls, man.  Yeah.  Foul.  Foul.  People are crazy out here.  The whole place is on fire.  I'm telling you, God hates California, man.  All right.  Well, and rightfully so.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, pretty much, man.  Everybody out here is so ridiculously flaky.  It's bad.  I'm not even from here.  I'm from down south.  Well, good for you.  We can hear that.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Where from the south?  Where?  I'm from Tennessee.  Okay.  All right, Travis.  Thank you.  I was born a coal miners.  Don't be nice.  Hey, you guys.  Take it easy, man.  All right, Travis.  Yeah, bye.  Bye.  That's cool.  All right, cool.  There's another guy from Sacramento.  Oh, God.  That's...  You want to go to Terry?  Great that they're listening.  Terry.  Terry?  Yeah.  What's up?  You're on the radio live. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, are you doing...  What did we learn today?  Sure, why not?  Now, you've just listened to the beginning of the show, right?  Yeah, so I've listened to the first half hour.  Okay.  Yeah, he's from Sacramento as well.  Go ahead, Terry.  What did you learn on the show today, even though you only heard a half hour of it so  far?  All right.  I learned that for every 13 minutes of show, we get six minutes of hilarity.  Wow, remember that?  That seems like days ago.  Hey, Terry, right on.  That's funny.  Thanks.  Cool.  All right, thanks.  Take it easy, man.  Bye.  Peace out.  He'll get to hear that three hours from now in Sacramento. 
[02:37:30]  Poor Sacramento.  We'll try to get on a little better schedule, maybe.  I don't know.  No, this is...  You like it over there like that?  This is an afternoon drive show.  It is true.  It makes sense to listen to the show on the way home from work.  That's the only way you should listen to the show.  At least they can understand that they can call up at six o'clock, six thirty when they  start hearing the show.  Even though we're not on yet, call us.  We'll interact with Sacramento.  But now they're not going to be able to do that until tomorrow.  Because by the time they hear this, we're home. 
[02:38:00]  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I don't know.  This is my first time listening.  Really?  Where are you from?  What I learned today?  I learned that you guys are ten times better than Howard.  Oh, how about that?  A lot funnier.  Yeah, man.  You guys are hilarious.  I just started listening to you.  My friend just told me about you.  I just put you on around twenty minutes ago.  Yeah.  You guys are funny.  Twenty minutes ago.  You guys are unbelievable.  Boy, you missed a lot.  Let's go back.  Ninety-eight.  Yeah.  We got here.  Oh, we should have told the guy from Sacramento that we saved someone's life today on the  show. 
[02:38:30]  Oh.  We could do a whole Back to the Future thing with Sacramento.  I don't think we saved someone's life as much as we did.  Get someone arrested.  Get someone arrested.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  You saved his life.  Here's another guy from Sacramento calling in.  Chris.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  You're from KXOA.  I'm from KXOA.  All right.  Just hanging out, listening to your show every day.  I get to hear it in real time.  Yeah.  Cool.  So I know what's going on.  I just want to let Sacramento know, we got some WOW stickers coming.  Okay.  Nice.  I actually made them myself.  Oh, man. 
[02:39:00]  That's a great...  So they got our logo in the center and stuff.  And it says, wow, I've got your guys' names on there.  Oh, sweet.  That's a grassroots effort.  How do they get them?  Well, we're looking for somebody to sponsor them right now.  Oh, man.  So...  All right.  Well, let's...  It's that kind of BS right now.  Let us know what we can do to help, all right?  All right.  Hey, man, and that killer, dude, that was right down the street from my house.  What, the guy that killed all the...  The guy?  The Russian dude.  And they still haven't found him?  I guess not.  How do you stab people and just walk away?  Yeah, how?  I know.  My whole family.  Why haven't they found him?  Well, he's driving away quickly, I imagine.  He's not stopping. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but they blocked...  All right, Chris.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Late.  We have to take a quick break, and we'll play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony  Show today.  Mario Cantone killing today for us.  He's playing Caroline's this Sunday.  Highly recommend you go.  Someone save my life tonight.  Opie and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel up your sister, feel up your sister,  feel up your sister.  Opie and Anthony.  You guys are awesome.  It's like, I gotta listen to you.  It's like a drug. 
[02:40:00]  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Mm-mm.  Sam Adams.  Summer may be winding down.  Do you want to do it in a Scottish accent?  No, I'll do it like Jim Cook.  Hi.  I'm the brewer of Sam Adams.  You know, if you're one six-pack away from being gay, make it a six of Sam.  Sam.  It's got a long neck bottle.  Maybe the both of you can enjoy.  Sam.  Sam Adams.  The Summer Ale, the number one selling summer beer in the U.S., possibly the world, and according 
[02:40:30]  to Jim Cook, in the entire universe.  Sam Adams.  Summer Ale won a gold medal at the 2001 Mons Selection, an international beer competition  held in Lisbon, Portugal.  Still, this guy's going all over the place for beer competitions.  Imagine being that guy, Jim Cook.  He just drinks.  That's his job.  We love it.  As I drink.  Hey, he just drinks.  Ain't it great?  Sam Adams.  Pick one up.  Wherever you are.  Sam Adams.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:41:00]  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Taylor from the Pooh Fighters, OD.  What?  He's all right, though, but they had to cancel the tour, the rest of the tour.  We would have given him pool tickets.  What is he, crazy?  Hey, I want to thank Mario Cantone for stopping by today.  I want to thank you for having me.  Yes.  I had a great time, and I'll see everybody to Caroline's, hopefully August 26th.  Oh, that's Sunday.  10 o'clock, Sunday night, Sunday night. 
[02:41:30]  And if you can't go to Caroline's this Sunday, it's going to be at Caroline's September 9th,  which is another Sunday.  We're all going to go to that show, because we'll be back from vacation.  You made our jobs really easy today, Mario.  Yes, I greatly appreciate it.  Always fun.  I appreciate it.  I had a great time.  Real quick, what did we learn today, Anthony?  Yes.  Ernio writes, new bit.  What would you do for tool tickets?  Also, I learned Mario Cantone does more women than men.  Who knew?  Oh, wow.  What a surprise.  Damn.  Uh, Jinx writes, I learned Muhammad Ali floated like a cinder block and stung like foam rubber. 
[02:42:00]  He also learned blind people don't know their rubber is black until they go to turn on the stereo and it's missing.  And then he writes, Norton rules in parentheses.  And IRA members hide in the English muffins, nooks, and crannies.  I get ya.  Ah, let's see what Vincent has.  Vincent, what's going on?  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Yeah, my, what did I learn today?  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  If we can't have flying cars, at least we could have internet porn.  Yes.  Yes.  We had to put our research and science into something.  Yeah, I was going to call you before about a website that you should check out for flying cars.  But then that stupid suicide guy called up and just screwed everything up.  I know, that guy.  He wrecked everything.  We don't even know what happened to him.  We just know that they took him away in an ambulance.  I'm sure he's fine.  Yeah, well, maybe we'll get an update tomorrow.  Thank you, Vincent.  No problem.  That was really fun radio, though.  Yeah.  Philip, what's going on?  Hello, is this me? 
[02:43:00]  Philip, you're on the radio.  Is this me?  Oh, I'm on.  Yeah, you're on.  Okay.  Hey, I'm in Sacramento.  I just wanted to tell you guys about an article.  It's a letter to the editor here today.  Okay.  Actually, first, let me say it to a long-time listener.  Anthony, I think you're the funniest guy I ever heard.  You're unbelievable.  Thank you, my friend.  And Opie.  I mean, bye-bye, that son of a bitch.  Wilson learned, I learned that black girl has lovely dimples and a very kissable mouth. 
[02:43:30]  Jersey Gary.  Gary, I learned you should never be far from an electric plug if you have an electric cart.  If the cops are after you, to never, ever hide under the kiddie pool.  And Rosemary from the Dick Van Dyke show looks like Ms. Pac-Man.  Yes.  Yes.  Let's see what Steve has.  Steve, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, boys.  Great show.  Thanks.  I learned if I threatened to kill myself, you guys would give me cool stuff.  True.  We gave away a lot of tool tickets.  I got another quick one, Opie. 
[02:44:00]  I also learned that Opie thinks getting someone arrested is the same thing as saving their life.  Stinky rules.  All right, man.  Stinky rules.  We didn't think the guy would get arrested.  We just wanted to make sure he was all right today, right?  Yeah.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Good.  How are you doing, Paul?  I learned today that there's a new wow sticker out, and it's proudly displayed on the back  of my fire truck.  Sweet.  Keep back 200 feet.  I'm a fire captain in northern Jersey, and please, wow it all over the place, wherever 
[02:44:30]  you can hear our voice.  Any fireman, I'm sure, and firewoman will appreciate it.  All right.  Let's whip them out Wednesday tomorrow.  We can't wait.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, Paul.  All right, have a good night.  All right, West Coast Dave from San Francisco.  Today, I learned that Tuskegee Airmen dropped syphilis on Berlin.  Got a couple of stories mixed up there at the beginning of the show.  Derek.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Today, I learned that the radius is five blocks of the diameter. 
[02:45:00]  Boy, you people are listening.  You guys listen way too closely.  All right, let's see what Dave has.  Dave, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that I ricked one beer away from being gay.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  And on the Rick theme, West Coast Dave again, I learned Rick was a complete tool for Universal  Studios.  Yes, he was.  Let's go to Columbus.  We have not forgotten about Columbus.  On the big wazoo.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You're representing Columbus.  The only call we've taken from Columbus today. 
[02:45:30]  What do you have?  Columbus rocks.  All right, go.  I learned that today, all you got to do is take a suicide to get free tool tickets.  Yeah, true.  Yes.  That only works once, though.  We're not believing anyone else that calls us.  Thank you, man.  Stinky rules.  All right.  God, the stinky rules.  The love for stinky is amazing, isn't it?  Sean, what's up?  Yeah.  Yo, guys, what's up?  Hey, y'all.  I learned that if you're going to commit suicide, don't call Illinois, otherwise I'd ruin it.  Yeah, we wrecked a good suicide.  We ruined suicide today. 
[02:46:00]  Is stinky letting through all the stinky rules calls?  Is that what it is?  Probably.  Tina.  Yeah.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned today that Opie and Anthony's show is real and that Rocco has fake O's.  Rocco has a lot of fake stuff.  Yeah.  Hey, shut up, bitch.  Yeah, and you know what?  I'm going to put a good word in for Mayam and Eno that you guys saved someone's life today.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, that might help out our situation in Boston.  Who cares about the man?  We miss you guys up here.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  All righty.  All right. 
[02:46:30]  Slut, you bitch.  Ass whipping.  All right, let me edit the phone call now and I'll make it sound like I really laid into her.  Hi, Rocco.  Yeah, bitch, what do you want?  All right, that sounds good.  You're a slut, right?  Um, yeah, maybe.  You're a slut?  Um, yeah, maybe.  Fake calls that he edits to make it sound like they're real.  Swacco.  It's the end of the show, Swacco bashing. 
[02:47:00]  It's like, wow, the anger.  I'm liking it.  No, no one's angrier than me.  We're going to kick his ass and he's going to look really stupid when that happens.  See, radio is like our lives.  I know.  And for the people that are working at our old station, it's just a job to them.  They don't really care.  I learned.  Oh, Mario learned something?  Yes.  Yeah?  Mario.  I learned.  I learned.  I learned that straight boys like Judy Garland, too. 
[02:47:30]  Hey, Matt, make it fast.  We've got to get off the air.  All right.  Go.  I'm just glad you guys are back from Marsden.  Oh, thank you.  And today I learned God hates California.  Uh-huh.  And then I learned that Dermis is too Irish for selfie.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a little weird.  All right.  What the hell is that?  We've got to cut you off because we're out of here.  Mario, thank you.  We'll see you at Caroline's on Sunday.  Sunday night, 10 o'clock, Caroline's.  Goodbye, boys.  I'll see you.  Have a great vacation.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And if you can't see Mario this Sunday, September 9th, Caroline's, same deal.  A lot of us are going to that show. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Peace.  Bye.  Anthony.  Hey, we're just on in New York right now.  Hey, New York.  Hey, New York.  What's up?  You know we love you.  Yeah.  Bastards at the beginning of the show.  I know.  They gave us all kinds of crap.  Just go with it, man.  We're having fun.  Come on.  Come along for the ride.  All right.  We've got five pairs of tickets.  Bricks.  Just for New York to see Blues Traveler at the Brookhaven Amphitheater in Farmingville,
