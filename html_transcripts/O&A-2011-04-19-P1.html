<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-topic.  It began with Anthony describing a brutal workout, likening it to S&M, and comparing male and female trainers. This transitioned into a discussion contrasting the bizarre sights in NYC parks (like mothers incorporating strollers into their workouts) with the more mundane suburban childhoods of the hosts.  The hosts then critiqued the movie *Little Fickers*, highlighting perceived inconsistencies in its production.  This was followed by a discussion of chimpanzee violence, including cannibalism and attacks on humans,  prompted by a nature documentary one host had watched. A caller then shared a story about teenagers surviving Golden Gate Bridge jumps, leading to a morbid discussion about suicide methods and a performance artist's fatal self-stabbing. Another caller promoted a website filled with videos of chaotic and violent events, including fights and accidents, some featuring nudity.

The show continued with Jim Norton detailing his Twitter feud over his dislike of Bill Murray in *Stripes*, sparking a broader conversation about Murray's filmography and the general inability of people to have reasonable online discussions.  This segment also included a lengthy, rambling discussion about Lady Gaga's "Judas" and the Catholic League's reaction,  a brief interview with news personality Jeff Field on the same topic,  a tangent about the disappearance of Holly Bobo, and a chaotic phone call with a caller named Bobo, who performed several impromptu radio characters and a one-man band routine with pots, pans, and a kazoo.  Mad Season's "River of Deceit" was played in tribute to Layne Staley. Profanity and disparaging remarks about various people and institutions were frequent throughout this segment.

Next, the show featured a "Most Annoying 30 Seconds" contest with a $2,000 prize, showcasing various sound effects and repetitive phrases.  The hosts' demonstration of their new Apple TV went awry, accidentally displaying inappropriate photos from their phones, including genitalia and a depiction of oral sex. The hosts discussed this mishap openly.  A caller discussed rumors of radio host Rover's potential firing.  A debate followed about increasingly restrictive rules on classic children's games like kickball and dodgeball, leading to a conversation about lawsuits and the legal profession.  The hosts shared anecdotes about dangerous childhood games they played, including "Kill the Guy with the Ball" (also known as "Smear the Queer" and "Maul Ball"), "sucks" bargaining, "Hot Bean," "Undie Flip," and "Peenie Flip." The segment concluded with further Apple TV discussion, musings on technological advancements versus societal decline, and additional listener calls.

The final segment began with a discussion about handball and its "asses up" punishment, transitioning into a Jackass stunt involving oranges.  The hosts then engaged in graphic sexual descriptions and a humorous anecdote about semen. The conversation shifted to the government crackdown on online poker, prompting complaints about governmental overreach.  A caller shared their frustration with the online poker ban.  Brief discussions about hockey and basketball playoffs followed, before a shift to images from Mars, including the "face on Mars" and a sunset photo, referencing Richard Hoagland and space exploration.  The hosts humorously calculated how far their voices had traveled since 1994, venturing into discussions about John Lear, moon structures, extraterrestrial life, the sinking of Japan, Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, and physicist Michio Kaku. Dr. Taco corrected their earlier calculations regarding radio wave speed. The show ended with a discussion about a baseball player arrested for shoplifting, a lengthy conversation about a beekeeper and his YouTube videos, including the concept of a "bee beard," and concluding advice from Dr. Steve on beekeeping and sting avoidance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do this.  Good morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony's.  You, how's everybody today?  There you go.  That's good.  Good to hear.  Hi, I'm kind of mad you didn't see the little fuckers.  No, I was the first workout since two weeks of vacation.  So, I was a little drowsy yesterday. 
[00:01:30]  Did he squeeze the alcohol out of you like I told you he would do?  Oh, God.  He was without mercy.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It was one of those things where it was like, I was hoping for like a little, all right,  maybe we'll lighten up on that a little or not do that or something.  No, no.  See, I don't understand trainers because you're paying them.  So, can't you just go, hey, asshole, I'm paying you.  We're going easy today.  I could.  But it's one of those like things where if you do that, then they're just like, ah, you 
[00:02:00]  fucking pussy.  What?  Really?  Should I even show up then?  How long was it?  Like an hour and a half.  Ah, just lifting and so fucking tiring.  But like I was, I was doing it just like this fucking is, is painful.  But you're missing the angle.  You pay the guy.  You tell him to relax or he's going to lose a client.  Yeah, well. 
[00:02:30]  And then, and then your workout, halfway through your workout, you guys are just sipping tea  watching SportsCenter or something.  That doesn't quite work.  That's just it.  But it's a weird balance.  It really is.  If you think about it.  Because at any moment you could go, fuck you.  I'm not doing this.  But the whole thing is he's supposed to beat the shit out of you.  Right.  That's like, that's the job.  Right.  So he's doing his job, you know?  And the second I start squawking about it and bitching about it to him, it would be like,  you know, he'd be, oh, really? 
[00:03:00]  Is this, is this it?  Right.  Because like, he's told me stories of people that like, they hire him and then there's  just a complete lack of dedication and shit.  And, and, you know, I'm not, I don't want to be that guy.  First of all, you got to get rid of the male trainer.  Why is that?  You got to get a female with a really nice ass.  Ah, distractions.  And when she's working you too hard, you go, relax, I'm paying you.  We're going to take it easy today.  I have a friend that's doing the boot camp one.  Ooh.  And they were talking about how.  What's the boot camp?  Where, I guess you make believe you're in the army for three months. 
[00:03:30]  And some of these places, they actually make you wear fatigues and stuff.  And this person goes, someone was acting up in class.  So the guy says, fuck that and turns off the music and makes them run up and down like  10 flights of stairs over and over again.  That's what I would go.  You know what?  I'm going home.  Yeah, that's a little over the line.  I'm going home.  Like, how do you agree to be in some kind of weird boot camp, but you're not going to  be deployed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where am I going? 
[00:04:00]  If I'm going somewhere, that'd be good.  They do the army crawls and all sorts of shit.  You know, you train for something and then you deploy.  And then I'm deploying to.  And then I go into the park and the new mothers have some kind of weird workout where they  like do shit around their, um, their baby carriages.  What?  Oh yeah.  And then they leave their babies at the bottom of the steps and they have to run up and down  the stairs and then they grab their baby carriages and move on to the next section.  You are seeing a portion of life that I have not a clue about. 
[00:04:30]  Well, that's the difference between New York and the suburbs.  You see some weird shit.  That is like.  You don't know about that?  Never heard of the.  That is definitely in every city.  The new mommies doing their workouts in the park.  Oh yeah.  And they jog along with their carriages and they stop at stairs and run up and down and  then like, you know, like the kind of like guardrails or whatever.  Yeah.  Then they do these weird pushups on those.  That's fucked up.  My mother, when she was raising me and Tracy, my sister, she couldn't go out.  She used to jog around our house. 
[00:05:00]  I forgot about that.  And my father was a marathon runner.  So my mom.  Your dad was a marathon runner?  Oh yeah.  He ran.  Was he good?  Yeah.  I mean.  Not to interrupt you, but that's.  Called him a marathon kid.  Yeah.  He was the marathon mean kid.  He wasn't like a guy.  He didn't win marathons, but he always finished them.  He did for years.  Did he do Boston?  Yes.  I'm sure he did the Marine Corps marathon.  He did a bunch of them.  Wow.  How many do you think he did?  I don't know.  I'll ask him.  But to me, just growing up, my father just ran.  That's what he did.  He just shrugged.  So then your mom ran around the house.  She ran in the apartment, in the house when we lived in North Brunswick.  She would just, she had this little weird pattern.  She would go like around the living room and then around the coffee table and down the 
[00:05:30]  hall and into her room and up and down.  It was so bizarre.  Why did she run outside?  Because I think my sister was too young and she would nap.  I don't know.  It was so bizarre.  I thought when you said she ran around the house, I thought actually outside, around  the house.  Inside.  Yeah, it was psychotic.  My mom was jogging around our coffee table.  That is psychotic.  Because you didn't have a giant house.  No, we had a few bedrooms and it was a normal suburban house, but not a good track. 
[00:06:00]  How obnoxious is that as you're trying to watch TV?  You're just running in front of you every two seconds.  Out of my way.  So the trainer beat you up though, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a good beating.  A sound thrashing.  Doing these kettlebell weights.  That's the latest thing.  Shit.  God, it's just a pain in the ass.  Tell them no more kettlebells.  Nah, because it works.  No more kettlebells.  It really gets you going, you know?  It's like, because you swing them around to the point where it's good for cardio because 
[00:06:30]  your heart really gets going.  And the weight itself is like, I think you're doing squats with them and moving your arms  back and forth between your legs up.  It's just, it's crazy.  Crazy.  How long have you been seeing a trainer?  You've really stuck with this guy.  Like, Anthony will leave and go, I got the trainer and he fucking really sticks with it.  It's like a year.  Wow.  It's been a big year.  Good for you.  Oh, it's fucking nuts.  It's just, but you pay, when you realize you're paying somebody just to beat you up. 
[00:07:00]  That's what I'm getting at.  It's the weirdest thing.  Yeah.  You agree.  Okay.  I'm going to hire you to beat the shit out of me.  It's sadistic.  It really is sadistic.  It's S&M shit.  Yeah.  Come on over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You tell me to lift that until it hurts me.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  But it was a, it's, you know, I normally don't mind it.  It's great.  The guy, the guy, uh, really figured out a great routine.  He knows, and he could, he could tell the instant something gets a little easier for me 
[00:07:30]  because then it stops and, and it gets to something more difficult.  He's a good trainer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy really is attentive and shit, but the, the fucked up part is after two weeks of  being off and on a cruise where you're just having fun, a lot of eating, a lot of drinking  and shit like that to get back into it.  Oh yeah.  And he thought I had gotten back on Sunday.  So he texted me and was like, so am I coming over tomorrow?  Wednesday. 
[00:08:00]  And I was like, I didn't think about it for a second because if I did, I just said, Wednesday.  So it's just like, come over Monday, you know?  Yeah.  So that was, uh, I work out, I work out in this gym and the trainers are always trying  to get new clients so they come up to you and stuff, but I watch how they train everybody  else.  It's a joke.  Really?  It's usually middle-aged women that literally are in the gym with their pocketbooks and  they go from machine to machine with their clip, you're not a clipboard guy, right?  No, no.  And they're just like checking off that they did this at this weight. 
[00:08:30]  That's...  And then the trainer, uh, is just having chit chat with the person while they're doing  reps.  I'm like, yeah, I want to yell at both of them, say you're doing nothing.  Yeah.  You're not...  If you could chit chat with the person, they're not working out hard enough where it's going  to make any difference in their life.  Very difficult to chit chat.  Right.  And then they have to pick up their pocketbook and move on to the next machine.  Wouldn't you as a trainer go leave your shit in the locker first of all?  Yeah, put it in a locker. 
[00:09:00]  And we're not going to chit chat?  We could talk on the way up to the machines and on the way back down to the locker rooms.  And it's not about checking off something on a list.  It drives me nuts.  A little...  They just check off that, uh, you know, they did that particular exercise and what weight  they were at.  But, uh, I...  I'm just at the point where, uh, especially yesterday, uh, when we were all done, he leaves,  I'm just like, oh, I'm exhausted.  And all I'm thinking is, ah, I don't have to do that tomorrow. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then there's Wednesday.  Good for you, man.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, the weather finally broke, so...  Pool's open.  Pool's open.  It's 47 degrees, but, uh...  Well, what's up with the heat?  Don't you heat that baby up?  Yeah, it's a little early.  It's a little early to start the burner up, I'll tell you, uh, that'll take...  That proves that you don't want to talk about it, but you took a hit on that fucking cruise.  No, no, no. 
[00:10:00]  Because that sucker would be up to 80 already.  Not even.  Because I could heat the jacuzzi up.  That's no problem.  But to heat that entire pool from 47...  The water temperature is 47 degrees.  It's got to...  The outside temperature has to be consistent, at least in the mid to upper 60s, before I can even start heating it up with a heat pump.  It's not going to work.  At night, when it dips down, it's still really fucking cold and shit.  Is the water crystal clear and ready to go?  Yeah, yeah.  All ready to go.  Have some people jump in, then.  Really?  Yeah, get some videos. 
[00:10:30]  Polar bear type people?  Get some videos going.  Some fucking heart-stopping episodes.  Tell some assholes that the pool's nice and warm and let them jump in.  Oh, it's heated.  Just jump in.  Oh, it feels like a bathtub.  I just got out of there.  It's unbelievable.  With the cold spring air, but the pool's warm, you're going to love it.  Oh, it's fantastic.  See, that's the crap I would do.  Louie had a funny skit.  Remember Louie's...  Did you see Louie's video last year when he was promoting Louie?  It was like he just talks into the camera, and then he just gets up, and he walks into the pool with his clothes on.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  And he just disappears.  Like a psychopath.  It was really creepy.  It really was.  Yeah, that was a little strange, but definitely kind of interesting.  You've got to see Little Fuckers.  Yeah, yeah.  I will.  Like I said, I was going to hit it.  This isn't a replay.  The movie, yeah, has come and gone, but I finally saw it the other day.  It's the whole thing.  I want to see how they injected the actors that were only on set for two days.  I want to say it again.  Dustin Hoffman, obviously, what we learned yesterday, I think he was signed after the filming of the movie. 
[00:11:30]  After the movie was filmed.  Because he only had one scene with Ben Stiller.  Yeah.  And he didn't interact with any other characters in the entire film.  Yeah, I guess.  And then at the end of the film, they show a Christmas scene where they finally got everyone together for a quick two minutes.  But that's basically when the credits were rolling.  Yeah.  And then I remembered something else where the mom, Ben Stiller's wife, she had the flu for a few days in the movie. 
[00:12:00]  Why would they do that?  Where all of a sudden she's like, take care of the kids.  I'll be up here in bed or whatever.  And she's blowing her nose.  And I'm like, there's no reason for her to have the flu.  What that's all about is she had something to do.  So she couldn't be on set.  So they just give her this flu character.  Right.  Like, unless it's part of the storyline, it's a movie.  Yeah, I was telling you.  They're not really sick.  So you don't have to write them as sick.  Right.  Yeah.  Usually there's a buildup to the reason why they're sick.  And the buildup is funny enough where now they show the person sick in the movie. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  She's just sick in the movie.  It doesn't make sense.  But it allowed Ben Stiller to do some acting with the kids without her around.  Because obviously she had something else to do.  Holy shit.  Please see this movie.  I have to say it.  Please see this.  It sounds like a complete catastrophe.  Everyone is kind of separate from each other.  And they try to make it look like it's one movie.  It's not.  That's great.  It sounds awful.  It sounds like shit.  9% positive reviews from the reviewers. 
[00:13:00]  I wish I saw the movie when it first came out.  Because then this would all make sense to everybody.  What are you going to do?  I think people have delayed anyway.  Now it's on demand and shit.  Well, that's why I grabbed it.  I think more people have seen it now.  I saw it on demand and said, what the hell?  I want to see what this dumb thing is all about.  Yeah, the on demand is the shiznit.  Yeah.  I don't watch anything anymore.  Just regular.  That's actually on at any given moment.  I don't think I watch anything that is really just on.  There's no reason to. 
[00:13:30]  Everything on demand.  There's really no reason to, right?  Yeah.  That or unless it's one of those, you know, Discovery Channel shows and shit like that.  I was watching some show on chimpanzees the other day.  Boy, are they nasty motherfuckers.  We've talked about it in the past too, but they, and we've talked about how in captivity  when they just grab a human and just start fucking them up, biting thumbs up.  And they had a couple of trainers that this one woman, her fingers are gone. 
[00:14:00]  Really?  They go right for the fucking fingers and the genitals and shit.  And she's just like, yeah, this thing grabbed her out of a spot on the cage.  It was like six inches on the bottom that was open.  And this fucking old male chimp was just waiting for her.  Bam!  Grabbed and just started chewing her fingers off.  But then they switched to them out in the wild.  And they are just fucking violent and nasty things.  Holy shit. 
[00:14:30]  They go and they eat meat.  They love eating meat.  They're vegetarian.  You know, they eat vegetation and shit.  But if they see meat, they're not passing it by.  They run up into these trees where there's monkeys, little monkeys in the tree, holding  the little babies and shit.  And they're tossing the males, monkeys, out of the tree, just throwing them out of the  way.  Not to kill them, but to get them out of the way so they could go for the females and  the babies.  And then they just rip them apart and eat their guts and shit.  Jesus. 
[00:15:00]  And they're just there like, wow, wow, and them fucking fangs and shit, looking all nasty.  And then they go out in these hunting parties, like five or six males will just go out real  quiet, walking in complete single file, and they're just real quiet, and they find a  male in their territory, and they walk like the perimeter, and they find a male in their  territory and beat the living shit out of them.  99% of the time they kill him, or it dies later on.  But they punch him, they bite his testicles off, and then things just lay and they're all 
[00:15:30]  beaten up, neck is ripped out, and you realize these fucking things are the nastiest, most  vile creatures.  And they were stealing babies there in Africa, just walking into these huts and grabbing  children.  Human babies.  Yeah.  And running off and eating them.  Holy shit.  It was fucked up.  I was watching this show like, fuck, these things are nasty.  They go for the extremities, like they go for your Achilles, your feet, they're fucking  anything you can't use to defend yourself or reproduce.  Yep, disabled immediately so you can't fight back, and then they just go in for the kill. 
[00:16:00]  And they have this group mentality also, where they will just stomp the living shit out of  one little chimp sitting there.  Is this your new angle?  No, I actually saw this show.  This is your new angle.  No, it was cool.  Another way to talk about you-know-what.  Not at all.  It was a great nature documentary.  This is your new angle, isn't it?  Yeah, okay.  No, but I'm just saying. 
[00:16:30]  Do you know, as I was pulling up this morning, I thought of that chimp attack in Connecticut.  We were stopped by like a cart, and I was meant to make a left onto 6th Avenue, and I'm  like, if that chimp dragged me out of this car, I was just thinking of the normalcy of  New York City and how-  That would be very odd in New York City, but-  But how nothing would frighten the chimp off.  And I'm like, what would it take to stop the chimp from biting me?  I don't know why I thought of that.  No, you'd be done.  There's nothing you can do.  You can't punch a chimp in the head.  No!  Like, he's not even going to give a shit about that. 
[00:17:00]  Dude, a 200-pound chimp or a 150-pound chimp?  They're fucking strong, man.  Real strong, fucking just nasty, one-mission.  Chimp noise.  To bite your face, fingers, and testes off.  Yeah, yeah, a big mouth with the fucking teeth.  Holy shit.  Right for the fingers.  Exactly.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, yeah, it was just-  But that's all I watch on regular television in real time, are documentaries and shit.  That's it.  Nothing better than a good documentary. 
[00:17:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah, there's plenty of good ones out there, too.  It's a great genre.  It really is.  I think it's taken off in recent years because it's so available now to everybody.  Because it's cheap.  To make, yeah.  It's all about cheap programming.  Some of them suck, but for the most part, you can find some good ones.  But you know what it is?  It used to be, you used to have to go to, you know, I'm going to watch Channel 13, you know, public television or whatever.  And catch a documentary every so often.  But there's so many now.  HBO's got a fuckload of really good ones. 
[00:18:00]  Good ones.  And all those, Discovery ID, History Channel, Smithsonian, all those have just great fucking documentaries now.  Someone wants to know if it was BET, this documentary.  No, it wasn't.  It was on the Smithsonian channel.  They have their own channel now, too?  Yeah, it's great.  It's like some cool-ass shit.  I love Fios, by the way.  Thanks to Anthony.  It's fucking rule. 
[00:18:30]  Dude, I've had one moment ever since I've gotten it.  It happened for a half a second.  It's fucking great.  They're going to freak out like, what the fuck?  No, I figured it was just like a little blip.  And it was nothing.  I don't have Fios yet.  Dude, you crazy.  Cable sucks.  The second you get it.  I love resetting my internet every day.  I love it.  Not having to unplug.  It's part of my day now.  Plug in the box again.  Get a big stool and climb way up high and reset my internet.  I love doing that every day.  Can you fucking...  It's part of my routine now. 
[00:19:00]  I don't know what I would do if I wasn't allowed to do that every day.  I got another call from Cablevision.  Really?  Another call just last week.  Are they trying to make you CEO so he can come back?  Believe me, it's that close.  Right.  They were begging.  This one woman is like, can I ask why you left?  And is there any way we can get you back?  And they're asking about money.  Like, we'll give you this for free, that for free.  I go, you don't understand.  I go, it's not about the money.  It's the product. 
[00:19:30]  I go, I could buy something for a lot cheaper and not be happy with it.  And that's what Cablevision was.  Ask for stock options.  Yeah, give me some options.  Give me some options.  On your shit fucking thing.  And then they're trying to tell me about new technology that they have planned.  Well, they have to.  Well, you know what?  How about I already have it with Fios?  Right.  This is a perfect example of a company that took advantage of its people for the longest  time.  And then a new technology comes in and you have no loyalty.  You're like, goodbye. 
[00:20:00]  And I didn't have loyalty, but I had fucking ignorance for so many years.  They had a monopoly and all technology.  And now they're getting fucked by it.  If you lived on Long Island, you had Cablevision.  Period.  You had no choice.  That was all you had.  Or you were going to get a satellite dish or whatever, you know, then they got that.  But now then I heard shit about that.  So all I was like was like, all right, I'm moving or I'm getting a house.  I'm getting cable in there.  Who do you call?  You call fucking Cablevision.  And then I realized, wait a minute.  Why the fuck am I putting up with this when there's another company out there that all 
[00:20:30]  I'm hearing is good things about?  So I check it out.  It's fucking fantastic.  There's no fucking way I would ever go back to Cablevision.  Well, I'm going to start researching.  It's great, dude.  Every time I see somebody in my building, I see like the Verizon truck outside.  I'm so happy.  Aren't you happy for someone?  Boy, are you going to love this.  Yeah, you want to tell people like, it's great.  I've never been so happy with a fucking product that I want to like actually say it. 
[00:21:00]  This isn't a paid endorsement.  This isn't it.  I'm just happy with the fucking product.  I just like it.  Will I be able to reset my internet every day?  If you want, you can.  All right.  See, but you won't have to.  Yeah, but it's part of my routine now.  I like doing that.  Isn't that great?  It's like, why am I not online?  Oh, there it is.  Let me unplug my fucking router for a while.  And it's nice and convenient.  Way up high.  Oh, yeah.  Wherever it is.  I'm on a rickety like step stool ladder thing. 
[00:21:30]  You get them to yank it.  It's the best thing.  I'm going to throw it at their feet.  Dude, those cable boxes when they're not in your fucking house.  It's got, again, on the iPhone or on the iPad, you can fucking program.  You can do your DVR.  It's great, man.  All right.  If you're away and you realize, oh, fuck, I didn't program that in to record.  Yeah, it's just one of those things that worked out very well.  Is there HBO On Demand on there?  I couldn't find that.  Yeah.  I couldn't find On Demand.  Okay.  It's all there.  And some of the sporting events aren't in HD. 
[00:22:00]  But that's about it.  On what?  Fios?  I think some of the local guys.  Well, that's because Cablevision owns the Knicks.  Yeah.  A couple of the teams.  So they were like, we're not giving that to you.  Wait, they won't.  There's no, you can't get the Knicks and HD on Fios because that's scumbag Cablevision.  Because they own it and they hold you hostage.  Like, yeah, that's what we're giving you.  But they don't say that in the commercials.  All they say is, oh, you're going to miss out on News 12 Long Island. 
[00:22:30]  It's like, oh, wow.  So they'll sell it to other cable companies.  Like, you know, the time war.  But just as long as you're not in competition with them.  How is that legal?  I know.  None of this is legal.  It's all one of those conflicts.  Well, I'll get the files.  Let's go to Steve in San Francisco.  This is a big story out of San Francisco this morning.  What a coincidence.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hello.  Hi, Steve.  What's up?  Not too much. 
[00:23:00]  Greetings.  It's real early here.  But I have now proof that we are, in fact, raising a generation of super kids.  Yeah.  What do you got, man?  We've got two separate teens tried to jump.  Well, they actually did jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.  Obviously, they saw boats down there and have survived.  Boats down there.  Great book.  Exactly.  Yeah.  What's going on?  The other one lives.  They both live the double tail.  Yeah.  What's going on with the Golden Gate Bridge?  People are starting to survive that a lot more.  What are they doing? 
[00:23:30]  It's a 16-year-old girl is the latest.  Did she jump on?  Was she trying to kill herself or was she being a crazy teenager?  They think that this one was a suicide attempt.  The kid, a couple of weeks ago, he was just doing it for kicks.  Wow.  For kicks.  What is this?  The 50s?  Balls, man.  For shits and giggles.  That's right.  And in Germany, another story.  Yeah.  You guys might have already heard about this one.  I just found out that Ron and Fez talked about this a couple years back.  But, Jim, do you know who Kim Petras is? 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  Never heard of a shit.  Can you guys get, please Google image her.  Why?  And just, I'll let you know that before anybody gets too excited, but I don't know, maybe Jimmy.  Jim, Kim was born Tim.  Oh, she's trying.  I never heard of her.  Oh, right, right.  That one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's that hot fucking.  This hot blonde was a guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's pretty.  I remember seeing that.  Did we do this already?  Oh, yeah.  I can see that.  You can see it?  Yeah.  Where? 
[00:24:30]  In the middle of the face.  I mean, but then again, I do know.  If I didn't know, I would not instantly know.  But now that I do know, it's not surprising.  Really?  Yeah, no.  That's pretty good, though.  I'd let that suck my dick.  Just saying.  That's all I got, boys.  Thank you.  Let me see another picture with the breasts or something.  Yeah, is there something like a...  Because I don't think she's...  I think she's cute, but I don't think she's beautiful.  Things are being hidden there.  Did she chop off her...  What's that one?  I don't know.  Her penis?  Let me see that one with the...  That's kind of convincing. 
[00:25:00]  That's kind of convincing.  They always have man calves, though.  They always have fucking, like...  Man calves.  Transsexuals have...  It's hard for them.  There's certain things they can't do with the backs of the legs, which are just masculine.  It's really hard things.  That's like skinny kind of legs there.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't see the man calves there.  No, I don't.  That one either.  That's kind of...  I think if you just saw that picture as you were trolling through a bunch of pictures,  you would never fucking...  You wouldn't say that.  No, you're right.  I used to be a boy.  I would not know, no.  But that one picture, I wouldn't be surprised. 
[00:25:30]  Maybe a little bit.  Hey, good job there, Steve in San Francisco.  She looks like Ozzy in, like, 1975 there.  Yeah, the fucking...  Of the volume four years.  Ozzy.  We got another kid jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge and surviving.  Yeah, what is that?  Yeah.  You've never been to the Golden Gate Bridge, have you?  No, I've never been to Frisco, the Barbary Coast.  You've never been there?  No.  Even...  All right, so you're depressed as a teenager, an adult, and now you go to the middle of the  Golden Gate Bridge, and now you have to jump. 
[00:26:00]  I don't know what it takes to actually let go, even when you're in that state.  That'd be crazy.  Because it's horrifying.  Yeah, it's scary.  Can you imagine going out on that fucking...  On the edge?  And then you have to let go.  It's horrifying.  From that film that they had with the people...  The people that kill themselves, yeah.  They all will look very tentative.  Like, even though they want to kill themselves, and they do, some of their phases are kind 
[00:26:30]  of like they hang for a little while, they move forward, then they kind of pull back  a little bit, like, ah, boy, this is it, huh?  I don't understand the people that do, you know, suicides like that.  I mean, if you're going to kill yourself, there's easy ways to go.  Peaceful, almost.  Some people set themselves on fire and kill themselves.  Right.  That's just angry.  I saw a video of a guy on the 20th floor.  He fucking set himself on fire and then threw himself out the window.  It was like there was no way he wasn't dying.  What a performance, Doc! 
[00:27:00]  What a performance!  But I can only do it once.  Well, what's that about?  Because if you want to end it, you can kind of just go to sleep.  Yeah.  You know, get your car in a garage somewhere.  That's a lot less painful than sitting on the edge of the Golden Gate Bridge and trying  to get yourself to fucking move forward.  I don't get it.  I couldn't do it.  What about that fucking performance artist kid that killed himself in front of that crowd?  What was this?  He played a little number. 
[00:27:30]  Played a little ditty.  Yeah.  Called something like Sorry About the Mess.  Uh-huh.  He played it.  And then he gets up.  He grabs a knife and just starts stabbing himself in the chest.  What was this?  And people are like, yeah, this is cool.  This is awesome.  Performance art.  No, he was stabbing himself and killed himself right there in front of people.  Where was this?  It's just happened the other day.  What city?  Trying to think of what city that was.  Better not have been Central Park.  No, no.  It wasn't New York.  I'm going to get to Portland or someplace weird.  It probably is one of those weirdo fucking jerks. 
[00:28:00]  It has to be a cloudy city.  That's a cloudy city.  But he was, yeah, he played this Sorry About the Mess.  Is the song a hit?  And, uh, I don't know.  How great would that be if the song becomes a hit?  It, uh, yeah, Oregon, right?  Yeah.  It is.  That was a guess.  Yep.  Good job, Jimmy.  Give yourself a bell.  Oregon, really good.  And he looks like the type.  He's got the wool hat on and, you know, man, I'm so fucking cool, man.  Teenager stabs himself to death on stage at open mic. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, wow.  In front of shocked crowd at a coffee shop.  That was all the features.  He looks like a young Ashton Kutcher.  Yeah, he does.  He's just depressed.  That sucks.  He played his little ditty, and then, uh, he just started thrusting a knife into his  chest, and people thought it was part of the act.  Is there a video of this?  This is fantastic.  Someone had to have got some video.  Someone, well, yeah, wouldn't somebody have, you know, pulled out a phone or something?  Wow.  It's a video of everything. 
[00:29:00]  There is video of everything.  You really can't do anything.  I also spent, uh, last night, all I did was watch, for about an hour, I watched fights  at McDonald's, Burger King, um, uh, KFC, Popeyes, uh, Waffle Houses, uh, Chuck E. Cheese, um, numerous other restaurants.  I, I just, all I did was watch fights. 
[00:29:30]  And it's people with cell phone cams just watching people, irrational people, beating the shit out of each other for no real apparent reason.  It was great.  I like the one-punch knockouts, seriously, those, when they show those, those sites, it's like a one-punch fucking KO.  Oh, yeah.  That would be a great website.  I like when the chairs go flying, and the, and dishes, and, and there's just yelling, and children, it's fucked up.  That would be a great DVD.  Remember, Bum Fights? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fast Food Fights?  Mm-hmm.  One DVD?  That would sell really, really well.  It's, there are so many of these.  I, I, I stopped before I finished.  Just, just so many of these fights.  Hey, would you do, uh, would you do this?  We got Chicago checking in.  Mikey.  Hey, Chicago.  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Hi, Mike.  All right.  You know, um, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a fighter fighter outside Chicago, and I'm sure some of my New York brothers have got stories like it.  But, you know, when people, like, you know, act themselves, you know, you see weird stuff. 
[00:30:30]  Guys hanging themselves along the corner and stuff like that at work.  And, uh, one of the ones that sticks out is, uh, was, uh, wasn't on my shift, but was on the shift prior to mine.  Uh, I had a 16-year-old kid walking down the train tracks.  According to what the, uh, the engineer said is, he was just walking, took a big squig of Jack Daniels, laid down face first, so his head was facing the train, and it just chopped his head to clean off.  Holy shit.  And that, that takes balls to sit there, hold your, your head on the track, and just let the train go. 
[00:31:00]  That depends if your head is facing the train.  Really?  Yeah.  That makes a difference?  Yeah, if you're facing the other way, it's nice and peaceful.  Yeah, but, you know, you'll feel the tracks start to vibrate, and you'll be like, when's it, when's it hitting?  When's my head coming off?  Is that harder to do than jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge?  Fuck yeah.  Really?  You have to lay there.  It's the moment of decision for the bridge is one moment. 
[00:31:30]  Joe, and you're gone.  But the train, there's that, you have to keep laying there until it hits you.  Very good, Jimmy, you're right.  The decision to stop is constant right up to the point where your head's chopped off.  Yeah.  The decision to stop with the bridge is right up until you jump, and then, you know, it's, it's out of your hands.  You only need one, fuck it, moment for a bridge, or a pistol, or, or, or, or standing in front of, like, you know, or jumping in front of a car. 
[00:32:00]  But if you're there with your head on the track, at any minute, you'd be like, fuck this, no!  You could actually start humming, like, you're gonna be dying, and you're like, am I actually humming?  She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes?  I saw, oh, there's a funny video on this site of a woman getting hit by a train in India.  She's walking to work, and the train, just take a look at that, see if you can Google that site.  It's, and, and, and the train hits her from the back, and as she's, as she's walking to work. 
[00:32:30]  It's a great, does she just get creamed?  Oh, is that that, uh, that's not that classic video of that woman trying to cross the tracks?  No, no, no, no, she's, you know what I'm talking about, right?  Where she goes flying into the camera?  She goes to follow, where it looks like a guy is gonna cross the tracks, so she thinks, oh, well, if he's going, I'm gonna go, but then he goes, I don't have enough time.  Right.  And he kind of takes a step back, but she keeps going, just walks right in.  No, this is a woman who doesn't see the fucking train coming.  Ugh.  And by the way, can I, can I address the, oh, oh, oh, oh, there it is, uh, go down, you just, just look for it, you'll see a woman hit. 
[00:33:00]  Jimmy knows all these sick-ass sites.  This is not, this is not a violent video, though, this is just a funny one, keep going down.  It's funny.  It's in the funny section?  Yeah, it's more done.  It's in the hardy, har-har section.  You might have to, it might be on a different page, Danny, you have to flip through a couple, but it's not like the, you know, page one, one, two, three, or four.  Or five.  Yeah, I don't, I saw it recently.  Yeah, possibly seven.  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  There's some horrible ones on this site, but, uh, I don't know how you go to these sites. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because everyone figures out where their line is.  That's where mine is.  It's a woman on a train.  I can't see the beheadings and all this stuff.  Keep going down.  People on fire and all that.  Accidents.  There it is right there.  Can't do it.  This one, it's called Train Hits Oblivious Woman.  It's a pretty good site.  Yeah, but, but first you got, uh, no, no ads.  Oh, here we go.  It's in India.  Oh, that looks like a nice little fucking freighter.  Big heavy choo-choo train. 
[00:34:00]  And, um, oh, why is she?  Oh!  She fucking smashed her.  That had to hurt.  From the back.  Oh, that had to hurt.  She's walking towards us and the train is on a bit of an angle.  Yeah.  And it fucking smashed her right in the back.  She's dead as a doorknob.  You think she's dead?  Come on.  That smacked her in the head.  Right in the head with a train.  She made it.  You think she makes it?  She was struck by a train. 
[00:34:30]  Look at them.  They're all blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They don't know what to do.  No, she's alive.  Put some leaves on her.  She's interviewed after it.  No way.  She is right there.  Holy shit.  She's a little groggy.  Yeah.  How did she fucking get hit with a train and she's walking?  I don't know.  Knocked her shoe off?  Of course it did.  Why do they always take your shoes off?  All that nasty bit.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She's talking.  Oh, that explains it then.  I thought it was the other thing. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, I didn't realize.  Yeah, they show it again.  Here it comes.  Oh, wow.  I guess it clipped her left arm and back then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like her shoulder.  That's kind of hurt, though.  Her shoulder plate.  That's why she survived.  It didn't really hit her in the head.  It looks like she gets run over, though, because of the angle the train kind of, the overhang  of the train goes over her.  Do you want to promote your new website?  Well, it's called, yeah, sure. 
[00:35:30]  It's called Chaotic, K-A-O-I-T-C.  I forget how I saw it.  Or K-A-O-T-I-C.  There's some nudity on there, too.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  K-A-O-T-I-C.  Yeah, I just, I stumbled on this one.  Yeah, there's naked girls on it, but it's mostly these horrible videos.  But there are some funny knockout videos on there.  Yeah.  Some really good fucking, like, one-punch K-O.  Some of them aren't as violent.  This looks like a very literal funny or die.  Yeah.  You know what?  Literally.  Very good.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:36:00]  It's not as bad as the other one, which has the beheadings.  This, I don't think, has beheadings on it.  Yeah, that's, I can't watch that.  I've been to some of these sites, though, where they've had nudity, and you're like, oh, cool,  you know, I'll watch this chick.  And then you're going through the little thumbnails.  Oh, dude.  And it's like, wait a minute, there's a chick, and she's getting a cum shot in the face.  This looks like a good video.  Oh, there's a half a person in the road.  Oh, there's fucking somebody with their heads split open from a machete wound. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I really didn't mean to.  What happened?  What a fucking war I started on Twitter yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Was that hysterical?  Oh, yeah, I meant it.  But I didn't, I didn't, it's funny how people reacted.  I wanted to jump in and just bash you.  Why are you saying this?  I don't like him.  I never liked him.  You don't like Bill Murray?  Never liked Bill Murray.  But I don't, I don't think Bill Murray, like, I have to, he's obviously a good actor, and  he's good at what he does.  I just never enjoyed him.  I think I jumped in your Twitter fight halfway through, so I was really confused. 
[00:37:00]  So walk us through this.  I watched Stripes yesterday, and I, and I, at first I was like, this is terrible.  And then I'm like.  Isn't the first half of Stripes good, though?  That's how I remember it.  The whole movie has hilarious parts.  Like, that's why I didn't use Twitter, Stripes sucks.  I actually began to write, like, I forgot how bad this movie was, and I'm like, no,  no, no, everybody's good in this, except for Bill Murray and fucking Harold Ramis.  I didn't like them.  Yes, yes, sir.  That, that's, you know, he goes, uh, John Larroquette was great, when he's like, well,  we're on our way to Bingo Parlor, and Larroquette goes again, shut up.  Shut up.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir. 
[00:37:30]  Well, when the fucking Russians come up to the back of the truck, and they all have guns pointed  at each other, and John Kennedy goes, here you go, bye, all right.  All right, bye, pass it forward.  Pass it forward.  Pass it forward.  Candy rules.  Fucking laugh out loud, but I always fucking never liked Bill Murray.  I didn't like him in Caddyshack.  I know that's sacrilege, but I never liked Bill Murray.  You didn't like Bill Murray in Caddyshack?  Did he have a couple good moments?  That's where he moves me.  Yeah, but I hated that whole fucking gopher storyline.  It was stupid to me. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I hated it.  Yeah, they just needed something to tie that movie together.  It was all just about goofing on fucking country clubs.  Lost in Translation I thought was boring.  People keep naming these movies I didn't see.  A lot of people are naming this one, that one.  I didn't see a lot of them.  The artsy Bill Murray movies that he's put out later in his career, I can't fucking sit  through.  Yeah, I agree with you.  I can't sit through those fucking things.  The Azuzu one?  Oh my God, what the fuck was that about?  Azuzu.  Ugh.  I don't know.  I'm trying to remember. 
[00:38:30]  I remember liking Stripes.  I'll tell you why.  This stupid little thing annoys me.  He plays himself in a lot of the earlier movies.  He does.  And can he be funny?  Yeah.  Because in Ghostbusters...  Hated.  I'll tell you right the fuck now, we've said it on the air, Ghostbusters does not hold  up.  I'm sorry.  I saw it recently.  It's a pile of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a pile of shit.  That's a movie, and it goes against something else we talk about on the show a lot.  I wouldn't mind if they remade Ghostbusters, which makes me hypocritical.  Is Harold Ramis in that? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  He is.  I hated their combo.  Dumb voice.  That movie is horrible.  It is.  You don't like his Kermit the Frog voice?  No.  He's fucking not charismatic.  Again, he's a serviceable actor, but he's not...  And then people get...  It's amazing, and maybe I do the same thing, but I said I don't like Bill Murray.  And people are like, he's funnier than you.  I'm not saying I'm funnier than Bill Murray.  Yeah, that's not the argument here.  I just don't like him.  Yeah, exactly.  People don't know how to argue properly.  And people unfollow like that's a punishment? 
[00:39:30]  Go fuck yourself.  Unfollow.  Hey, I will not read what you write.  Who gives a shit?  I'm not paid by the person on Twitter, you faggots.  I don't give a fuck.  Unfollow.  Unfollow.  Why don't you really protest and fucking hang yourself with my picture hanging up?  There you go.  You fucking jizzbags.  There you go.  Oh, I love when they think they're punishing me by not...  Don't even tell me.  Just let my numbers dwindle. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  Oh, God, that's great.  But it's amazing how...  Your day's going to be ruined because they are unfollowing you.  I literally...  Get the fuck out of here.  It is an impossibility for me to be less concerned than I am.  I could give a fuck.  But the fact that people get so mad was funny to me.  Like, they really are mad.  So, you were watching Stripes, and then you had a tweet that you just didn't like.  Because I always...  I'll tell you one thing that drove me nuts, and this is not Bill Murray or Howell,  Ramis' fault, is when they all get their crew cuts, how everyone gets a crew cut, but  those two still kind of keep their hairstyles but shorter. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  That fucking drove me nuts.  You're right.  They can't commit.  They can't commit to the movie role.  Oh, it drove me nuts.  I wish you would have texted me.  I would have watched Stripes just so I could be more in this conversation.  Because I remember the movie being pretty good the first half.  There's a couple of moments where...  I know exactly what Jimmy's talking about.  There's a couple of moments.  I like when they went to the recruiting center, and they were asking the questions, like,  are you gay?  And he's like, you mean flaming?  Yeah, yeah.  A couple of lines like that.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  The push-up thing was kind of funny, because he couldn't fucking do one push-up.  But, yeah, this...  Harold Ramis finally realized, I'm not quite the guy that really needs to be the actor.  Yeah, I'm going to go behind the camera.  Yeah.  And watching these two, in those fucking horrendous scenes with Sean Young and fucking P.J.  Souls, those fucking terrible scenes where these two fours are fooling around with the  fucking hot MPs, go fuck yourself. 
[00:41:30]  Who's going to answer my treatment?  Stupid stroke mouth.  Ha ha ha ha!  He's got a special under her hiney!  Oh, fuck you, you nerds.  You fucking Bill Murray nerds.  I'm not mad if you like Bill Murray, but the ones that were so fucking defensive of Bill  Murray, just fucking crush up glass and eat it.  They really were defensive, too.  Oh, it's fucking...  Bill Murray's had a really strange movie career.  Yeah, he's had an amazing career, pretty much.  I mean, Caddyshack is a great movie.  Yeah, Caddyshack, I loved him. 
[00:42:00]  He was okay in that.  I just didn't...  To me, Ted Knight was great, and fucking...  And Rodney.  And that's another movie where Bill Murray is detached from the entire movie.  Like, his scenes are all a separate movie.  Yeah.  Because we're going with the little fuckers theme.  It's another one where it's almost like, did they film that after they filmed everything  else?  Just drove me nuts.  How fucking...  You know what's funny?  When John Larroquette walks in and the fucking...  And the RV is gone, he goes,  Who the fuck's my truck? 
[00:42:30]  Like, I'm glad I didn't bash the movie, because there were some fucking, like, moments that  still made me laugh.  But most of them were John Candy or John Larroquette.  Like, John Candy is one of the funniest guys ever.  Yeah.  What about the whole, lighten up, Francis?  Ah, fucking Warren Oates was great.  Yeah.  The fucking moron.  Guys call me the cruiser.  Oh, God.  Cruiser.  Yeah, just a dolt.  No, it's customary for you to make my bunk.  Now, if I was in Germany, I'd have to make your bunk, because right away, it's your bunk.  And I still, whenever I trip over something, like an idiot, I always turn around and point 
[00:43:00]  and say, have that removed.  Fucking hell.  And then I'm going to bed last night, and Young Frankenstein's on, and Gene Wilder, one of  the...  That movie was hilarious.  But people just got so mad.  Yeah, I thought you lost your mind yesterday.  No, I just...  I'm not a big...  Because, like I said, I got in the...  I was late to the party.  I wasn't in that bad a mood.  Jimmy's losing his fucking mind today.  People are like, dude, why are you in such a bad mood?  But I'm like, I really wasn't. 
[00:43:30]  And then I saw fucking the BlackBerry, that fucking tablet, and it just made me angry all  over again.  And I just attacked people who use BlackBerry.  And it's like, I'm attacking you guys.  Why?  Because I feel bad for you.  Like, you're being fucked.  No, that's the iPad killer.  I loved your battles yesterday.  It was so much fun to read.  Yeah.  It really was.  But I love when people...  There were some guys that smashed me and that were really funny.  And I actually retweeted them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But guys are just being cunts, like, unfollow. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Well, Bill Murray's one of those guys.  He's just, like, beloved, I guess.  He's like...  What were you doing back in 1980?  Exactly.  Nothing.  Same thing I'm doing now.  Hating Bill Murray.  Didn't we do this recently?  We're trying to figure out the last good movie he was in.  And you go way back now.  Yeah, it's quite a ways back.  Groundhog Day, I never saw all of it.  What I saw was pretty good, but...  I liked Groundhog Day.  But he played a straight guy in that, really.  A straight man.  He didn't have a lot of jokes in that movie, did he? 
[00:44:30]  I don't remember.  Not really.  Kingpin was hilarious.  That was very funny.  He was great in that.  Right the fuck off.  Somebody mentioned that, and I was like, yeah, he was really funny in that.  I liked that Groundhog movie.  I don't know.  I just didn't like him.  I liked his hair and stripes, the fact that he wouldn't get a crew cut.  It's going to be fucking crazy.  He was already losing his hair, and he was probably scared it was never going to grow  back.  He was good in Ed Wood.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Was he more serious than that, or he played a gay guy with him?  Yeah, yeah.  He played kind of a gay guy and stuff.  It was one of Ed Wood's cronies. 
[00:45:00]  That was good.  Yeah.  The fucking movie's fantastic.  I forgot he was in that.  I didn't say Bill Murray has no talent.  He just annoyed me in fucking stripes.  You've seen What About Bob, right?  With Dreyfuss?  Yes.  It's been a long time.  I don't know.  I like that movie.  Yeah.  I haven't seen that one in years.  People kept mentioning movies.  I was like, oh, yeah, that one.  Oh, yeah, that one.  There were some ones I forgot about.  You had a bunch of hits, Jimmy.  Yeah, I know.  Let's go to Darren in Canada.  Darren.  Hey.  Hey, I just was going to mention, I kind of know why Bill Murray was acting the way he 
[00:45:30]  did on Caddyshack, like for that character, Carl.  Yeah.  He just did Where the Buffalo Roll, where he was playing Hunter S. Thompson.  And if you watch that and then watch Caddyshack, you can pretty much see where that Carl character  kind of came from.  All right.  All right.  So he took a little something from that other movie.  Yeah.  It kind of messes a guy up when they play Hunter S. Thompson.  Like, look at Johnny Depp. 
[00:46:00]  He did that for Fear and Loathing.  And then look at him as Captain Jack there on Pirates.  Same kind of thing.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you, Darren.  Even growing up, I never really found Bill Murray.  I remember my ex-girlfriend many, many years ago would talk about him.  I'd be just like, I just don't like him.  That's like the late 80s.  I never loved Bill Murray.  You don't like him on SNL?  I don't remember him on SNL.  He'd be all swarmy and shit.  I mean, look, I'm sure he had some funny.  Well, he didn't.  Oh, that was Aykroyd and Steve Moore that did that. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't say he.  I never liked Aykroyd.  In the Blues Brothers, he was great.  And he was good in Neighbors.  He had some with Kathy Mallardy and Belushi.  I was never a huge fan of his.  Early SNLs, man.  Aykroyd was pretty fucking funny.  Yeah, I agree.  When the writing was really cutting edge and funny and shit, and for the time, they gave  him some good shit.  But then when he moved into movies, not so much.  No.  He had a couple, absolutely.  Oh, God.  What movie was that? 
[00:47:00]  Nothing But Trouble.  That was horrible.  Nothing But Trouble.  That was horrible.  Where he had the dick nose.  Who's that?  They put Dan Aykroyd.  They put the dick nose on him.  Trouble is never.  Trouble is a ruiner of movies.  Like, if that's in the title, your movie's probably going to be fucking heinous.  Trouble.  Who's in it?  Nothing But Trouble.  Demi Moore.  Oh, John Candy.  Okay.  Fucking Dan Aykroyd and Jerry.  Young Frankenstein.  That Gene Hackman scene as the blind man. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, come in.  A friend.  Is fucking hysterical.  Yeah, that is great.  He's fucking pouring soup on his dick twice.  And the fucking creature just wants a fucking glass of wine.  And the camera's set up.  And fucking Peter Boyle is holding his coffee mug.  And he says, oh, toast.  And he fucking smashes his glass.  Oh, I fucking laughed out loud watching that alone.  Yeah, that's hysterical, man.  That was a funny movie.  So how did your Twitter battle end? 
[00:48:00]  I'm sure it's still going on.  I finally took a nap after a little while.  I was so tired yesterday.  But, yeah.  Boom, chugga, lugga, lugga.  We got it.  Yeah, he didn't like that part.  Yes, I do like when he goes, well, army training.  That part I like.  However, that's a fact, Jack.  Really?  Yeah.  Boo.  Didn't like the way they train themselves.  The 35-minute scene where they're doing the funny chants.  Fuck you.  Fucking nerds. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, Bill Murray.  Really?  All right.  You like him.  I don't.  I don't follow you.  Why?  Unfollow.  That's the greatest.  Goodbye.  Unfollow.  It's like, I'm not your fucking mommy.  What, are you going to hold your breath till you turn blue?  I don't fucking.  If you said, put my head in an oven, I would literally make sure I plug the oven in for  you.  Give us a fuck.  Yeah, who cares if you're unfollowed?  I mean this as sincerely as I've ever meant anything. 
[00:49:00]  Those of you that unfollowed me, I honestly mean this.  If I found out that a couple of them killed themselves in the tub, it would affect me more  if this coffee dripped on the fucking console.  You're irrelevant to me.  But they unfollowed you, sir.  That's what, it's like, who gives a fuck?  Like, there's nobody I follow right now that could state an opinion that would offend me  so much, I wouldn't follow.  I just don't get it.  People think they're hurting you by kicking and screaming. 
[00:49:30]  It's like, I don't give a fuck.  Very funny.  All right, there you go.  But I was surprised by how people reacted.  Bill Murray had a bunch of hits and then a bunch of weird movies.  I forget how it even started, honestly.  I just, I just, I happened to choose.  Watch Ghostbusters again.  Wow.  I wouldn't be bothered.  That's a rough one.  Um, fuck.  I mean, I just find the...  Couldn't be bothered.  The first one.  Oh, this was, one guy wrote, uh... 
[00:50:00]  Wow, you have a lot of opinion about actors.  Your mother must be so proud.  Ooh.  What does that mean?  I just wrote...  It's not even mean.  I just wrote, good one, Nana.  It's like, what a fucking horrible slam that is.  I don't know when you call someone Nana.  It's because they always deserve it.  What a terrible...  Nana.  It's a terrible comeback.  I can't find...  Oh, goodness.  All right.  Uh, I know it's, uh... 
[00:50:30]  Well, figure it out.  We'll, uh, we'll read some of those after the break.  Get a couple of the good ones.  This is the first one.  I can't...  Oh.  Oh, sugar.  Yeah, don't worry.  Don't...  You're panicking.  I really am falling apart.  We'll read a couple of, uh, tweets that came in for Jim Norton after the break about Bill Murray.  How's that sound?  Watching Stripes, not a good movie, John Candy rules, but Bill Murray stinks.  I know, I know.  Sacrilege.  Yeah.  That's what started it.  You knew it was coming.  Yeah, and actually, I will stand correct.  I should not have said not a good movie. 
[00:51:00]  I kept watching it after I wrote that, and it was very funny.  Yeah.  Except for him.  I was distracted by the kickball story we're doing after the break.  What did you just say at the end?  I was saying that I did actually say I shouldn't have written...  If I could read you that tweet...  What movie was it again?  Stripes.  Okay.  So you started enjoying Stripes after you wrote that?  I was watching a Bill Murray scene just going...  And John Candy wasn't embarrassing in that movie.  He was hilarious.  He was hilarious.  John Larroquette was very funny.  John Larroquette, underrated as far as...  P.J. Soule.  How good he was in that movie.  And her dumb fucking lusterless hair. 
[00:51:30]  The answer, my treatment.  Watch that.  Somebody watch.  I know I stink.  Well, sorry, for the record.  Got it.  And Sean Young is awful in that.  She's fucking horrible.  Her and horrendous Harold Ramis.  I'm supposed to have interest in these two fucking zilches?  You know when she was great?  When Gene Hackett was throwing her off the fucking balcony and no way out.  That was...  That's when she was great.  When she was fucking falling to her death into a fishbowl.  That was the omen.  Sorry.  All right.  We'll break. 
[00:52:00]  I should have told D-Rock ahead of time.  Can we play Elaine Staley's song?  They found him nine years ago today.  Nine years?  Yeah, he died like two weeks prior, but he shut everyone out of his life to the point  that it took that long to find him.  Lead singer of Alice in Chains.  I want to go Mad Season, though, today.  River of Deceit.  Really?  Yeah.  We did Nutshell Unplugged last time.  But it's still good.  It is still good.  And it's still good.  Wood is not good.  I just said River of Deceit. 
[00:52:30]  Ooh.  E-Rock just goes is Wood good.  No, I want River of Deceit from Mad Season.  Your song I like off that record, fucking Wake Up.  You play that here.  I actually bought this.  That's a great tune.  It's really slow, but it's a good tune.  I would love to play Wake Up, but I think we put a lot of people to sleep with that one.  It's a long, long song.  It is a long one.  I mean, search it off on your own, man.  Wake Up by Mad Season is a great fucking song.  But we're going to play one of the hits today going into break.  Lane Staley found nine years ago today. 
[00:53:00]  He did a little something with Mad Season.  A little side project when he wasn't doing Alice in Chains.  So we'll do this today, and we'll be back.  And we'll be back.  We'll be back.  Thank you. 
[00:53:30]  Thank you. 
[00:54:00]  Self-chosen  At least  So the prophet says  I could either burn 
[00:54:30]  Or cut off my pride and buy some time  A handful of lives is a way tied to my waist  The river of the sea falls down 
[00:55:00]  The only direction we fall was down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down 
[00:55:30]  My pain  Is self-chosen 
[00:56:00]  At least  I believe it to be  I could either drown  Or pull off my skin and swim to shore  Now I can grow a beautiful child 
[00:56:30]  For all to see  The river of the sea falls down  The river of the sea falls down  Yeah  The only direction we fall is down  Down, oh down 
[00:57:00]  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down 
[00:57:30]  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  Down, oh down  There's a virus, SiriusXM  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony  Yeah!  Woo!  Alright! 
[00:58:00]  Yeah!  Woo!  Alright!  Yeah!  O.B. and Anthony, Lady Gaga, causing controversy.  Really?  Can she do anything else that is like Madonna?  Is it a religious thing?  Yeah, she's got a new song called, I think, Judas.  Is it called Papa Don't Preach?  And it's angry in the Catholics.  Or is it the other one with the fucking... 
[00:58:30]  I'm a Catholic.  Where she's kissing the black Jesus?  I'm a Catholic.  I'm not bothered by any of this stuff.  Is this another fucking...  Again, fuck the church, but is this another corny attack on Catholicism by these fucking non-rebels?  How about you go after the one that really is roughest on women right now, you fucking cornballs.  Would you have respect for Lady Gaga if she did the Muslim thing?  She wouldn't dare.  She would never.  And neither would Madonna.  They won't fucking dare. 
[00:59:00]  Get her talent out there.  And that's the problem.  If she has talent, which she does, is to have singing talent, just use her talent to sing.  She doesn't need to go out and offend Christians.  But do you like Lady Gaga's music?  Do you listen to it in your house?  Don't listen to it.  I personally don't listen to it.  My wife listens to it.  Your wife listens to it?  My wife listens to it.  There's some songs that I can bop my head to.  I got to tell you.  I know.  Right.  Let's hear a little bit of the beat.  The beat in this song is positive.  Go.  Roll it.  Roll it. 
[00:59:30]  Matt.  Yeah, listen to that.  This is the intro.  And when the words start, you know, I don't know.  I can't follow the lyrics in those songs.  Can you?  Even our favorite songs will do the first line and then we'll kind of trail off.  Right.  Exactly.  So what's the bottom line?  Exactly.  That's exactly what he deserved on that show.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, just asking her to be more sensitive to Catholics and Christians.  You know, if she was to release this song in August, it wouldn't be that big of a deal.  Oh, come on, Jeff.  You wouldn't have anything to say in August?  We've got you on speed dial. 
[01:00:00]  It's the timing.  That's the most offending part about it.  It's the timing of this release.  Did you hear what he just said?  We understand.  Jeff Field, thank you very much for being here.  And that's where everything is wrong with the news.  Thanks a lot for having me.  We got you on speed dial.  New York seems like a no-brainer.  Doctors shouldn't.  They call these guys to get a reaction to create the story.  The media tries to create a story.  We got you on speed dial.  Why would you?  There's so many problems with that minute of audio.  We just played the guy saying that she's talented.  She doesn't need to do that.  But artists have been doing that since art began. 
[01:00:30]  Of course she's going to do that to get everyone talking about her.  And it got everyone talking.  And then you go to Jimmy's point, which they should have went with, the news.  You know, why doesn't she go after Muslims?  That's a great angle to take on this whole thing.  And that's one thing I like about Donahue, even though I don't like the Catholic League.  But he does raise the one really good point.  If you did this about Islam or Martin Luther King, there'd be a major outcry.  But because it's Catholics, it's safe.  And I don't care if people shit on Catholics. 
[01:01:00]  Fuck them.  But I don't like the fact that they think they're really being rebellious.  You're not.  It's not 1960 anymore.  Yeah, wow.  Nobody gives a shit.  Look what she's doing.  She's wearing a cross on her crotch.  Well, no, people give a shit, though.  Everyone's talking about it today.  And that's exactly what she was hoping for.  Yeah, but it's the easy thing you can do to get attention.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like Jimmy said.  But she's not stupid.  She knows the news is going to fucking grab this and run with it.  Wear a burqa and then have a fucking Muslim guy punch her in the fucking face and sing about that. 
[01:01:30]  And what she's doing, she knows show business won't punish her for that.  The business won't punish her for that.  Like the business is punishing Mel Gibson.  The business will not punish her for that.  Is it the business of show?  The business we call show.  Yes, I say that a lot.  And I say that with what I'm like.  I want to hold a cigarette and say that in somebody's face, but I don't smoke.  Here's the official news story.  We just jumped in in the middle there.  This YouTube video shows Lady Gaga playing her newest release, Judas, for a cheering crowd. 
[01:02:00]  Sounds great.  But some Catholics say this time Gaga's gone too far.  The lyrics say Jesus is my virtue, but Judas is the demon I cling to.  She goes on to sing about loving the man.  Hey, man, Judas has his fans, too.  Yeah, you know.  I mean, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  That's not even that bad.  He had followers?  He would have done well on Twitter. 
[01:02:30]  He would have done great, Judas.  Loving the man who betrayed Jesus.  If it involves the Bible or Jesus or anything, someone's going to be offended by it.  I mean, that's somewhere where you're treading into very thin water.  The Catholic League was quick to respond, writing Gaga off as, quote,  increasingly irrelevant and lacking in talent.  Spokesperson Bill Donahue goes on to say,  Lady Gaga tries to continue to shock Catholics and Christians in general.  She dresses like a nun.  She gets raped. 
[01:03:00]  She swallows the rosary.  She has now morphed into a caricature of herself.  Put them up her race.  That's a good point.  I mean, and again, I don't find what she does offensive at all.  I like her.  I really do enjoy her music.  But stop thinking you're a fucking maverick by only attacking.  You want to attack the church?  Fucking go ahead.  Brutalize them.  But I think it's hilarious.  She knows how the media works.  She does.  And why go all in when you know you can do something safe and get the attention?  So safe. 
[01:03:30]  So I see it both ways on this one.  Look at South Park.  And I'm not even a fan of that show.  Fuck, South Park rules.  It does.  I just don't watch it.  But those guys, fuck it.  To me, that's perfect comedy.  It's because they attack everything.  They fucking brutalize the church.  They brutalize Muslims.  They brutalize Jews.  Yeah, Scientology.  Yeah, Scientology.  Race they make fun of.  It's like everything is fair game with those guys.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course.  Yes.  Mike Farrell.  Yes. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  It's just one of those things.  It's been done.  It's been done.  Yeah, she's fucking.  It's catchy.  It's everything.  She's getting attention.  But, again, it's so fucking safe.  Don't make it sound like, oh, boy, look what she's doing now.  She's upsetting the Catholic Church.  Really?  Who doesn't?  But that's the media's problem.  They should call her out on and go, wow, that's really brave.  You know, wow, that hasn't been done before. 
[01:04:30]  That's the angles they should be taking.  Madonna did this, and she's going after an easy, quote, easy religion.  Because the Muslims wouldn't stand for that shit.  And it seems like the J wouldn't accept that shit either.  Ask any of these people why they wouldn't attack the Muslim religion or goof on them  or put them in a song and make them offend them.  Right.  Ask them why they wouldn't do that.  Why doesn't the news ask that question?  Would she say something like, well, the Catholic Church has been doing this and that's why I'm doing it? 
[01:05:00]  Well, the Muslim religion is violent and heinous.  They're still stoning women in certain areas.  They're stoning people, yeah.  So what's your hypocritical fucking comment back at that question?  That's the angle I would take if I was doing the news reports on that.  Ask any of these people.  Yeah, fuck the, wow, what are you doing to the Catholic Church?  Say, so, what are you doing about the Muslims?  You doing anything on them?  Why don't you get real brave?  Yeah.  They won't do it because, again, it's like, make some real statement about the burqa. 
[01:05:30]  Be on stage in a burqa.  Do something that they would find, make a statement, and that they would find very offensive.  Well, Lady Gaga understands how dangerous that really is,  and she knows that all she has to do is this easy thing to get everybody, including us, talking about it today.  And, I mean, how many years ago did Sinead rip the picture of the Pope on SNL?  Well, they didn't know she was going to do that, Ant.  They didn't know she was going to do that.  It was outrageous.  It's like, really?  It's 2011, and you're still thinking that's outrageous? 
[01:06:00]  You know what I always think when, so Sinead O'Connor rips that up, right?  And I just wish there were cameras rolling after she leaves the stage because it had to be so awkward for her and everybody else.  Yeah, just to hear click, click, click of her walking away, her shoes.  I always just wonder that part of the story, how just incredibly awkward it was, and how did she get out of there?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  The fact that people got offended at that, it's like, who gives a fuck?  The Catholics really are annoying, too. 
[01:06:30]  They're fucking obsessed with their own image, and if you badmouth it, the problem with the church is there's been so many problems in the last decade or 12 years with ass-fucking and diocese paying off.  And the fact that they've shipped ass-fucking child rapists from fucking place to place to place.  From radio station to what?  But they almost have fucking no leg to stand on.  I mean, that's why the Catholic League can go out and fight for them, but they can't even stick up for themselves with the way they behave.  Of course they ship them around.  You got to. 
[01:07:00]  When you have a left-handed prospect, you don't just give up on that.  Oh, jeez.  You ship them somewhere else.  You ship them somewhere else.  Another team.  And get something for that.  Maybe send them down to the minors.  Right.  Literally.  You can't just let the left-hander go, man.  No.  Well, that's very valuable to an organization.  Yeah, you're right.  So we got that going for us today, which is nice.  And another beautiful white girl is missing, and her last name is Bobo. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, I hate seeing it on the news because it's like, search for Bobo continues.  And it's like, no, it doesn't.  I don't care.  And then I realize, oh, it's this hot blonde girl.  Jesus Christ.  Where's she from?  Details on that story.  Apparently, she was coming home from school, and her brother said she saw some guy in camouflage  pop out of the woods and grab her. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, that's just crazy.  And drag her into the woods.  How old is she?  And 20 years old, nursing student.  Every parent's name there.  Holly Bobo.  Her name's Holly Bobo.  Holly Bobo.  Holly Bobo is so fucking hot, it's retarded.  Can I see a picture of Holly Bobo?  Look at the pictures of Holly Bobo.  Yeah.  That's a goddamn shame right there.  They're going to find her in that shallow grave with the fucking...  Blonde blue eyes.  Dr. Bodden investigating the larvae on her to see how long ago she was killed. 
[01:08:30]  That ghoul.  Terrible.  Yeah, the blondes with blue eyes rarely come back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Rarely.  I hate when you see that.  Oh, that's her Facebook page?  Not anymore.  Well, not anymore, huh?  What is it, a little tribute?  Is that her boyfriend?  Is that the guilty party?  I'm sure she'll never update it again, so...  Yeah, probably not.  Did they find her or not?  No, she's still missing.  Yeah, but obviously it's someone close to her.  That's...  It's usually the way, but sometimes, especially Tennessee, if it's some guy just popping out 
[01:09:00]  of the woods, it could...  And she's a pretty girl, it could just be a guy that, you know, the switch went off in  his head.  Nah, nah, let's make a bet.  What are you thinking?  Someone very close.  A boyfriend, something like that?  A boyfriend.  Who was she with when it happened?  She was coming home from school, and her brother saw a guy grab her and drag her into the  woods.  And that was like it.  So how old's the brother?  Well, that's just that they haven't dismissed anything as far as...  They won't rule out the brother or her boyfriend. 
[01:09:30]  Of course not.  Why didn't the brother try to do the best he could?  I don't know.  Maybe he didn't like it.  Maybe she was...  There's some shenanigans going on here.  You think there's shenanigans?  Yes.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It usually is.  See, I'm betting against the odds here, because it usually is shenanigans.  But when you get a girl like that, you know, people look at her.  They stalk her.  Maybe the brother might be psychotic. 
[01:10:00]  Maybe the brother did it.  Maybe, but, you know, who knows?  I don't think they're any closer to finding her.  Such a hot daughter.  Bobo case.  Investigators need help in the Bobo case.  That's the thing that annoyed me.  It's like she's hot, but I have to look at the name Bobo whenever I look at this story.  Let's go with this.  I say brother did it.  You say brother?  Yep.  I'm thinking brother.  That brother would be weird to do it, especially a 20-year-old girl.  And I don't know how all the brother is, but...  A guy in camouflage? 
[01:10:30]  That sounds like a weird fucking...  Maybe boyfriend.  That's a weird alibi.  I saw a guy in camouflage jump out of the woods and grab her.  I'll poke a hole in that right now.  If the guy was in camouflage, how did he get seen?  Ah, that's right.  See?  He would have just said, I just saw my sister, like, fly into the woods.  I'm calling Bravo Sierra.  Yeah?  See, he's got...  I'm saying boyfriend.  He's got too much details involved.  Yeah, you would just say some guy came out of the woods out of nowhere and grabbed her.  You wouldn't say in camouflage.  I think he was Asian. 
[01:11:00]  Asian.  They found some blood, too.  Oh, she's dead.  Yeah, she's so dead.  The blondes with the blue eyes are never catching release.  Never.  There are pictures of her and her brother both wearing camo three days ago.  This guy says he's going 75% brother, 25% boyfriend.  I'm going to go 26-74%.  Oh, well, what are you...  Price is right rules.  Well, she's another hottie, you know, missing. 
[01:11:30]  That's too bad.  That is terrible.  Oh, wow, look at that.  Yeah, look at that.  That's the brother?  That's the brother?  He's guilty.  That's the boyfriend.  That's the boyfriend?  Oh, boy.  Boyfriend's so guilty.  Yeah.  I'm saying, and I am not a law enforcement at all and have no say in this whatsoever.  You're speculating.  I'm making allegations.  Peculiar.  I'm alleging that the boyfriend...  I would go with the boyfriend. 
[01:12:00]  But apparently he's got an alibi.  What is that?  Who cares?  All right.  Let me say hi to Tennessee.  This guy's been following...  The whole state?  Yep.  The whole state checking in.  What's up, sir?  Hey, man.  Hey.  What's up, Marcus?  You're on the show.  See, go.  Joe, you're on.  Joe, what's up?  Tennessee.  This is Ben.  Yeah, right.  Whatever.  What do you got?  All right.  Hey, man.  No, love you guys.  I listen to you all the time. 
[01:12:30]  No one gives a shit.  Yeah, whatever.  This chick, she is hot.  I guarantee you.  She is super hot.  But it's a really bizarre case because you wonder, Jim Woods, has this guy been stalking  her out?  But they don't think it is the brother.  He found blood on the front step of the house.  He thought it was her boyfriend outside with her.  Saw him walking off into the woods.  He thought it was kind of an innocent thing.  Then when he went outside, saw the blood.  And that's his story.  Oh, so.  Where was the blood on the porch? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, like on the front part of the house there.  Yeah, they probably had an argument.  He probably fucking elbowed her in the mouth or whatever.  Whoever took her.  Oh, boy.  Dragged her off.  Stalking her.  And then came up to her and said, I'll kill you and your brother.  Because obviously, if he knew he was home, the parents were out.  It's just sick as all get out.  She's a gorgeous girl.  You know, parents are like.  We really do care more about the hotties.  Dude, look at the front page of the fucking Daily News and the Post.  There's some blonde.  Cops say the suspect in the murders of mom fled to Russia. 
[01:13:30]  A hot blonde gets killed.  I really do understand why blacks hate us.  What?  I really do on some level.  This is why they're fucking.  This is why we're not liked by black people.  It's your own news network.  All right, Chris.  Cover those stories.  Let's go to Chris in Tennessee.  Tell me.  Chris.  Hey, this is Chris.  I went to school with Holly's aunt.  Bullshit.  Have you been questioned?  I would question you.  You sound guilty as shit.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:14:00]  No, I just tell the family.  And I was going to tell you, she was on her way to school and not coming home.  All right.  On her way to school.  Well, that solves it.  Yeah, well, in the morning after her mom and dad, they left for work.  Oh.  Her mom's a teacher there.  What does the dad do?  Yeah, what does the dad do?  So just, it's a small rural area.  The place where they are, there's four wheelers, you know, ATVs and stuff everywhere.  Do you know her?  Do you know her?  Like, did she go to school there?  Because the school couldn't phone her. 
[01:14:30]  She had to take the first step.  I didn't know Holly.  I knew her mom and her aunt.  I mean, I know the family.  I'm from the area.  So you have nothing to add.  Exactly.  You just got excited because you knew somebody that was related to her.  Well, what I was going to tell you is that the area there, the camouflage, I mean, people hunt all in that area.  So it's not uncommon for a guy to be there and camouflage.  No, it's someone close to her.  Stop it already.  Do you think?  Everyone just relax.  It's somebody that knew when her parents were leaving. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  I think that, too.  Yeah, for sure.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Wow.  All right, here.  Where's the fugitive?  Is he around?  Blair is bobo.  Wasn't he bitching yesterday on fucking Twitter that he's not on the show again?  Bitching?  He was on hold.  He's out of control.  He was on hold for three hours yesterday because he wants to, I guess, invite me to a Mets game or something.  You got to let him invite me.  You got to go.  That's good. 
[01:15:30]  You got to.  I would probably go.  Sit way up top.  I'd probably go.  No, sitting there, there's fucking, why I'm tied, there's fucking nothing but seats available.  The Mets are horrible this year.  Oh, come on.  It's so early.  What's their record?  Anyone know?  No.  No.  No.  No, I don't really follow the Mets these days.  What's up, Sam?  No.  Sam has something on Bobo?  Not the pretty Bobo.  No, no, no.  All right.  The even prettier Bobo.  That's right.  On Friday, when, you know, we weren't on the air, all day, he was calling people who work here. 
[01:16:00]  Mainly me.  Yeah.  But he was literally on the, and he kept calling Liam, too.  The talent booker, asking why he can't be booked on O&M.  The talent booker?  Yes, he keeps, like, and I'm going Bobo.  Now, how would he get the talent booker's number?  Well, because once Liam got him an XM subscription or something like that, I don't remember what  it was, and Bobo saved his number.  Very clever.  He calls him constantly.  Bobo's smart for a retard.  Very clever. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, for a retard.  But he, like, he doesn't understand, I go, Bobo, you have to, you know, there's lots  of people who want to come on the show, we're doing a show, you can't just say, well,  I want to come on and start yelling and crying and expect to come on, you have to actually  have something, but he doesn't, I mean, that's not his way of thinking.  Well, doesn't he have characters?  Yeah.  I've seen every time he's been sitting out there in the hallway, never coming in the  show, but sitting out in the hallway, I walk out, and Bobo has just a multitude of new 
[01:17:00]  characters.  Well, we've been brainstorming characters with him on the phone so he can come in with  some new stuff.  What is, give me one character.  One character was Daniel Curlin, the gay abused car salesman.  Daniel Curlin, the gay abused car salesman.  It's a different Daniel Curlin, it's just a coincidence that they have the same name.  That they have the same name, right.  All right, we'll interview him as characters.  Yeah, just characters.  But we need three, tell him.  There was another one.  Fuck it, he just found it way back on the show. 
[01:17:30]  There was one guy, who was the guy who was afraid of the post office?  He created this character who was afraid of the post office, and we went through some  improv exercises.  How'd it work out?  Well, the guy was afraid of the post office, because he thought that somebody was sending  him mail bombs.  And one day, as Bobo and the character, he got a package, and he opened it, and it turned  out to be a mail bomb.  And it was a mail bomb.  So that character died, so he won't be on the air. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, he won't be on.  That's ironic, by the way.  What was his name?  That's what Danny's looking up.  We can't even remember.  But his mother is now a character.  So Bobo now portrays that character's mother.  Wow.  Wow.  Nice.  Wow, he's a weirdo.  As he was jabbing a fucking coat hanger into his crotch.  Oh, fuck.  He has to come on and do this.  Well, as characters, yes, I would say that.  I would accept that.  Mr. Amos uses character.  Hey, a lot of people wondering where Voss is, because Voss is an FBI profiler. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah?  Something we learned while you're on vacation.  Yes, he is.  Voss, when he's bored on the road, will tell people he's an FBI profiler.  When he's playing golf.  Because he's such an unfamous comedian.  He can get away with that.  So when they ask him on the golf course, what do you do for a living, sometimes he'll say,  I'm an FBI profiler.  I'm an FBI profiler.  And then we called him out on it, and it was horrendous.  He stinks at profiling.  It was horrendous.  Oh, so he couldn't, even the simplest of things, he couldn't profile.  Picture Voss trying to explain, you know, wow, I really know it's a male. 
[01:19:00]  Great point.  Well, that would be a white male, age 35.  He says, when they're on a case, they have lookouts.  Lookouts?  He told some guy on a golf course, you know, when we're hot on a case, we have lookouts.  How does he leave without a fucking seven iron wrapped around his neck?  They feel sorry for him, I think.  They know he's lying.  They humor him.  Oh, God.  Oh, imagine that.  They're probably just like, oh, this poor guy.  So this guy last comic standing a few years ago, now he's pretending to be a profiler. 
[01:19:30]  A serial killer is his expertise, too.  Well.  He's into the serial killers.  Is he profiling the one in Long Island?  Oh, it was terrific.  Yeah.  Yeah, I bet he's right on the money on that one.  He's convinced they're on the East Coast.  A black female.  62 years old.  What a dope he is.  You almost adulted me.  I almost did, but I saved that word.  You're back.  You don't have the list? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I just remembered what the character is.  Oh, did you?  It's Mullet Man.  Oh, it was Mullet Man.  Mullet Man.  It was Mullet Man.  Mullet Man.  Mullet Man was the guy who was afraid of the post office who died.  So now Bobo's other character is Mullet Man's mom.  Oh.  Let me say hi to, uh, wow, this is Holly Bobo.  Holly Bobo.  Yes, this is Mullet Man's mom.  Who the heck took that bomb there? 
[01:20:30]  He was so wrong.  Wait a minute.  Now something happened to your son?  Yeah, he put a mail bomb.  A mail bomb?  Yeah, it's right.  Now wasn't he afraid of a mail bomb for so many years? 
[01:21:00]  And then what happened?  And it blew up?  Hello?  Is he getting in trouble for doing characters?  He's like, I'm doing his character on the show.  Oh my God, look at Anson Williams. 
[01:21:30]  Uh, so, hello?  I'm sorry about that.  My mom was a mother.  Mullet Man's mom's mom.  Mullet Man's great grandma.  That's Mullet Man's grand.  What happened?  What happened there?  She was asleep.  Well, I can't hear you.  Talk louder.  Speak up.  Yell.  She was asleep.  We didn't want to wake her up.  Well, we can't hear you, so if, if, if, uh... 
[01:22:00]  I don't want to wake her up.  We can't hear you.  You got to speak louder.  We cannot hear you.  You got to speak up.  I didn't want to wake her up.  Oh, okay.  You didn't want to wake her up.  Uh, where is Mullet Man now?  Six feet under.  Oh, he did die in that explosion?  Yes.  We can't hear you.  You got to be louder.  He did.  Yeah?  What'd the explosion sound like?  What'd the explosion sound like? 
[01:22:30]  I can't hear you, ma'am.  You're on the radio right now.  You have to be louder.  Yeah, come on.  It just sounds like wind.  Yes, wind.  Now, uh, uh, Mullet Man's mom.  Hello?  Yeah.  Um, I'm sure you were very, very distraught when the police came to the house and told you  that, uh, he was dead, right?  What did that sound like? 
[01:23:00]  Please recreate entirely and at full volume.  What it sounded like when you were informed of your son Mullet Man's death.  Go.  Uh, yes.  This is the NYPD.  We got terrible news.  What is it?  Uh, your son just died in an explosion.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I only told him to take him a package that he was excited about getting. 
[01:23:30]  I finally told him that he said in his med jacket he always wanted.  Med jacket.  You got to be louder and you're upset.  You got to cry and scream like, oh, my baby.  Oh, no.  I'll be dead, idiot.  Like those idiots in a terrorist country. 
[01:24:00]  I'll beat him up like a, like a MMA guy.  What?  I'll beat him up like an MMA guy.  Like an MMA.  I, I, I don't think I like this character.  I don't think I'm digging this character.  It's too quiet.  It's too quiet.  I can't hear it.  I can't hear it either.  People are complaining.  People are on the radio and they want to hear a loud person. 
[01:24:30]  How about this?  Yeah.  How about, you know how all the, uh, car salesmen have those commercials where they're  very, like, sort of boisterous about the cars they have in the lot for sale?  What if?  $500!  $500!  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What if Daniel Curlin, the gay abused car salesman, uh, uh, was doing, did a commercial  right here?  That would be good.  Uh, Daniel Curlin, the gay car salesman.  Abused.  The gay.  Gay abused car salesman. 
[01:25:00]  Sell us a car.  Make like it's a commercial.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  I just remembered something.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the angle with the car salesman was that it was, he was trying to always sell you  a real piece of shit car.  Ah.  He was pretending like it was the best deal ever.  Oh, now that's the angle.  And if you were a guy, he would flirt a little bit.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  What an angle he's got.  Okay.  Now.  Hey, you gotta check out this fabulous car.  It's got massive stereos. 
[01:25:30]  Keep, keep going.  Keep going.  How many, how many stereos?  A nice purple paint job.  Nice glittery purple.  Fabulous.  I can't hear ya.  I can't hear ya.  Tell us when.  Do you make it like a car?  You ever see a car commercial, you dummy?  Do the whole thing.  It's gotta be like a minute long.  Go.  This car is fabulous.  It's great.  It's only got 5,000 miles on it.  And it's fabulous.  You gotta take a big glittery wheel.  It's right there. 
[01:26:00]  On the other corner of Grand and 50's, dink.  Don't actually tell people where you live.  It's a made up address.  It's a made up address.  It's a made up address.  Maintain the character.  Maintain the character.  Come on.  What are you doing?  It's on the other corner.  Up on the other corner of Grand and 59.  You gotta take it out.  It's fabulous.  You gotta be getting a nice glittery car.  You gotta take out this nice gold and lavender. 
[01:26:30]  Ugh.  The brakes and the wheels.  Hey, son.  Hey, it's fabulous.  Hey, Daniel Curlin.  What if a cute guy comes in to buy a car?  Ooh, I gotta spank that.  You gotta spank that.  Hey, you spank that and I'll hand you the keys now and spank that.  It's only 500 bucks for you.  You know what you should do?  Because people sleep on car deals.  You have to start the commercial by yelling, wake up. 
[01:27:00]  Because that's what people have to do to get these new car deals.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yell, wake up, wake up, wake up.  Just yell.  Come on, wake up there, you bitch.  Come on, come out here.  It's only 500 bucks for this car.  Wake up, bitch.  Come on, I'm a slut, dude.  I got you the keys right now.  Hold on, I need the keys right now.  Is it the gay black?  No, abused.  Just abused.  Oh, just abused?  What kind of abuse did you suffer? 
[01:27:30]  I got raped by my brother.  I got raped by my brother, he said.  And his name's Daniel Curlin, but it's not him.  It's a different Daniel Curlin.  It's a different Daniel Curlin.  I have this motherfucker.  There was also, there was one other character.  One other character.  All right, let's go.  One more character.  I can't remember the guy's name, but I do remember that he sold fruit outside of Mets  games.  Oh, that's right.  What's, what's, what?  Hey, are you the guy that sells fruit outside the Mets games? 
[01:28:00]  What's your name?  Yeah, Misa Papi, yeah, that's right.  I sell, I sell fruit in front of Citi Field.  What's your name?  My name is, uh, my name is, uh, I'm trying to remember, my name is, uh, Pedro.  That wasn't it.  What was his name?  I don't remember what it was, but it wasn't Pedro.  Hey, I, I forget, I forget the name.  You forgot your own name?  Yeah, I don't know. 
[01:28:30]  I'm bad too much running across the border.  What?  Are you, why, are you Mexican?  Yeah, that's right.  I can't remember running across the border.  That sounds like Bob Dylan.  I freaking just started throwing food at the.  Bob Dylan.  Bob Dylan.  Bob Dylan.  Bob Dylan.  I threw food at everybody.  Yeah.  And I also got food thrown at me for once selling vavuzulas.  Ah.  That's right, he also sold vavuzulas.  Oh, all right.  Fruit and vavuzulas.  Okay, well that sounds, uh, great. 
[01:29:00]  Um, why don't you tell us about, uh, your fruit and how much it is and.  Oh, oh, it's fresh.  I, I, I grew up with my own little special liquid.  What?  Yeah, I grew up with my own liquid.  Your own liquid?  Yeah.  Is that it called pre-cum that seems to drip out of your dick every time you fucking see a girl?  No, it's a yellow liquid.  Drinking a lot of water.  I don't know.  Okay, okay.  Okay, I'm not feeling these characters. 
[01:29:30]  There's one that's more topical.  That he, well, he said that he was tired of going on the bullshit after show.  Right.  He wants to come on the main show.  The main show, right.  The bullshit show is not for him.  No.  Uh, but while he was on, he said that he was working on a more topical character.  Oh.  Called Bobo Charlie Sheen.  Bobo Charlie Sheen?  Yes.  Hello.  Hello.  What you doing here?  Drake, you're talking to the gnarled, gnarling pin himself.  Winning. 
[01:30:00]  Duh.  You can't get that me.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Gotta do more.  Yeah, this is real topical.  I can tell you these damn, damn warriors after me.  Damn haters.  Oh, these damn trolls.  They don't know.  I'm full of tiger blood.  And now there's only one other person who can handle Charlie Sheen's drug besides me.  That's me.  And I can also handle a drug called Daniel.  Daniel.  A drug called Daniel? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  And I also handle a drug called Anthony Cumiya.  That's a lot of drugs.  Don't bring my name into your stupid fucking skits.  What other drugs do you handle?  Uh, I also, I also, I also handle any drug named after a guy that died.  Drug abuse.  What?  No, I'm gonna be evil.  You can just handle it.  I can just drop on my mind.  I can just get those tickets right now with my mind. 
[01:31:00]  Tickets?  Where's your mother?  Uh, she, she, she's, she's, she's asleep.  I cannot hear you.  We have to hang up on you.  You're not being loud enough.  Bye, Bobo.  She's asleep.  Bobo.  Do you know, Bobo, do you have a, do you have two pots in the house?  Like a pot and a pan?  Uh, I do, I do, but my mother is not, my mother.  But what about a character that we don't care about, your mom?  This is you. 
[01:31:30]  We need this for the radio, Bobo.  Do you understand?  Bobo, the one man band.  Yes.  Our character we need, and this is to get back on the show, is Bobo, the one man band.

You work on that for tomorrow, okay?  All right, believe me, I'll be working on it tomorrow, all right?  All right, it's going to be very early, though, tomorrow, okay?  Don't tell anyone that you're doing this.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, I got to have some work from my mother, all right, to calm her down right now. 
[01:39:30]  Is she mad?  Well, why don't you talk to her right now?  Yeah, why don't we talk to her?  You really want to talk to her?  Well, let's hear you smooth things over with her.  Go ahead.  All right, Mom, all right?  They want to talk to you briefly, all right?  I just want to talk to you briefly.  What a nice wake-up call.  Hi.  We don't know what your son was up to.  That was weird.  Was he being loud? 
[01:40:00]  No, just a little, like the neighbors upstairs and the dogs started barking.  I heard the dog barking.  We're asking him to keep it down.  Now we can get evicted.  Well, he had a character that he wanted to show us for the program.  What character was that, being annoying?  No, Bobo the One-Man Band.  Yeah, Bobo the One-Man Band.  Bobo the One-Man Band is the character.  I like it, though.  It's a good character.  It is a good character. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, Daniel, they love it so much, you cannot go to their house and wake them up.  And you know how he loves being on the show, and I think he's found a new inn.  Bobo the One-Man Band.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We know he loves the show, but God damn it.  People need to sleep.  I was trying to tell him that, but he just insisted on playing his instruments.  Yeah, he wanted to keep playing it.  Oh, he wanted to blame it all on him.  No, no, not blame it on him.  It's just it makes him happy.  So we're like, yeah, go ahead.  Do it.  It's fun.  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Are you being sarcastic?  I think she is. 
[01:41:00]  I love you guys, but God, you guys are such pain in the ass.  That should be on a poster.  Yeah.  I might as well make shirts with you guys from my pain in the ass, and I'll have all your  pictures on them.  All right.  I hear you.  All right.  Well, I'm only kidding.  You know, you guys are great, but hey, come on.  Let me put the pain in the ass back on the phone.  All right.  Hello?  Yeah, Bobo.  Great job, by the way.  Bobo, could you tell your mom to get in the kitchen and make you some fucking food? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, I'll get in the kitchen and make me some fucking food.  Oh, please.  It's going to be an interesting day at the curling house. 
[01:42:00]  Exactly.  She's in the mirror just booing her vagina.  Wow.  How you doing, Bobo?  I'm doing good.  Yeah, okay.  Is she cooking for you now?  She is.  She's getting the pancake mix.  Really?  Oh, you're going to have some pancakes.  Yeah, some pancakes and some sauces.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, some pancakes and what?  It's sausages.  Oh, okay. 
[01:42:30]  It's a linger longer.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, linger longer.  Can you tell your mom, I don't want any fucking pancakes?  Hey, yo, mom.  I don't want any fucking pancakes.  Hey, yo, mom.  I don't want any fucking pancakes.  Holy shit.  Oh, God damn.  This guy's hysterical. 
[01:43:00]  I got one for you.  Yeah.  Bobo, will you do this one?  And I swear you'll be back on the show.  All right.  Go, mom, I need to know.  Did you fucking drink when you were pregnant with me?  Oh, boy.  Mom, I need to know.  Did you fucking drink when you were pregnant with me?  I know.  I can't even do it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What's she saying, Bobo? 
[01:43:30]  No, she's just because she says, no, I didn't.  I think I did coke.  Holy shit.  Oh, fuck.  All right, Bobo.  Hey, I got one.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-oh.  You should say, with the potholders and the drugs in them.  What?  What?  Shit.  With the potholders and the drugs in them.  What?  You are. 
[01:44:00]  That's good.  You're great, Bobo.  Thank you.  I don't know.  I think you're in.  We'll check back with you tomorrow for Bobo Curlin.  Bobo, Daniel Curlin, the one-man band.  It's going to be great.  Keep it simple.  All right.  I'm going to listen to the song right now to try to get the song right.  Yeah, yeah.  Get the song down.  Yeah, but don't tell anyone you're doing this tomorrow.  All right.  Don't worry.  I won't be telling you. 
[01:44:30]  You'll just get to hear it.  I hope you're kidding.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, Bobo.  I'm sorry.  Of course.  All right.  You have a good day.  All right.  I got to go eat.  Yeah.  Bobo got to eat.  There he goes.  All right.  Holy shit.  That's hilarious.  He's getting yelled at.  Pots and Pans are taken away from him.  See, he had characters.  He finally has a character. 
[01:45:00]  I kind of like it.  Mr. Imus, he's got characters.  Yeah.  That hour of the morning, bashing Pots and Pans and singing Meet the Mets.  That's a fantastic character right there.  It was a slow build, but there was an ending there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you kind of work on this.  You've got to kind of feel your way around.  That's what makes me wonder how people cannot like Bobo.  Like, he just banged Pots and Pans around.  I was sick of the Mets song.  And he's a grown person.  He's not like he's 17, 18.  He's like 28 years old.  He just told his mom, I don't want no fucking Pans face. 
[01:45:30]  I'm just thinking of his family.  It's like, there's a retard banging Pots and Pans.  Like, I'm trying to sleep.  And this retard is banging Pots and Pans.  Because Bobo, he's like, he's functional, but he's not.  Like, he gets to go outside by himself and ride the train and shit, but he probably shouldn't.  Yeah, yeah.  He's kind of out there.  I've seen people that are just as Bobo.  And they need 24-hour care.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:46:00]  God damn, that's something.  All right, we'll break here.  Stay right there.  Bobo, the one-man band. 
[01:46:30]  And getting some good feedback on that.  I loved it.  Oh, loved it.  I loved it.  I loved it.  We're doing our Most Annoying 30 Seconds contest.  Yeah.  What do we got?  What's the big prize on this, Travis?  It's $2,000.  Wow, wait.  What?  Courtesy of Steven Singer.  Oh, wow.  And they got to get their entries in, right?  By Friday at noon. 
[01:47:00]  By Friday.  Eastern.  At noon Eastern time.  That's when we can't take any more entries.  No more.  Okay.  All right, you bastards.  You heard the fucking rules.  And I see we got four of them in front of us today.  Yeah, you got some real good ones.  Well, you know, good considering.  They're ones.  Yes.  There's your four ones that the staff has decided is fit for air.  Yeah, these people that have taken certain audio from the program and used it in some type  of mix to make it really annoying. 
[01:47:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  All right.  We got Ray Juergens, it looks like.  Made the cut.  Ray Juergens.  These are good ones, Travis?  Because sometimes we like to play the bad ones.  Well, no.  Yeah, these would be considered good.  We listened to them yesterday and everybody laughed and said, hey, that's a good one.  Okay, so here's the first one from Ray Juergens.  The most annoying 30 seconds.  Is this it?  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow. 
[01:48:00]  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  That's annoying.  I think that'll grow on me as being really, really annoying.  Well, that's based on Ronnie B.  Ronnie B said that everyone makes a very different machine gun sound. 
[01:48:30]  Different machine gun sound.  Yeah.  Why am I looking at a ball bag on TV?  We're trying out our Apple TV.  Those aren't just any balls.  Those aren't just any balls.  I don't know if you know.  Those are the Derek balls.  That's D-Boy's ball bag.  What a way to try out our Apple TV.  Well, we have to test Apple TV instead.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  Look on the screen there, Jimmy.  There's our Apple TV.  Those are Danny's balls.  No, those are Derek's balls.  Oh, that's right.  My balls are way bigger than that.  You got big balls.  They are tiny balls. 
[01:49:00]  He's got a tight nutsack.  It must have been in the winter.  Yeah, it's a little tight.  A little tight.  Derek has giant balls.  So that was Ray Juergens in the most annoying 30 seconds.  I didn't hear it.  You want to hear it again?  I do because I had to tinkle.  Remember when Ronnie B came in and said that everyone makes their gun noise differently?  Yes.  Like, what's your gun noise when you were growing up?  It was like...  I did like a silenced kind of, you know...  And mine was pow, pow, pow, obviously. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Surprise, yours wasn't...  I did pow, pow, pow.  Black, black, black, black, black, black, black.  Jimmy, what was yours again?  A boom.  A boom.  That's not...  A boom.  No.  I think...  I think I did a...  I don't like a drum solo.  Too, yeah.  I don't like...  Yeah.  We also did like...  I went cartoon for Ronnie.  I went pow, pow, pow.  What about...  Peter Griffin? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  So this is the first one.  You missed Ray Juergens.  We're playing some of the most annoying 30 seconds.  Okay, cool.  To see where we're at with the contest.  You got to get your entries in by Friday, once again.  This is the one you missed when you were in the bathroom.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow. 
[01:50:30]  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  That's fucking horrendous.  That's really annoying.  It's not going to win the contest, though.  I don't think so.  No, but it's a good one.  It's good.  Christopher Colangelo. 
[01:51:00]  Colangelo?  That's an odd product line.  It's Colangelo.  Is that young Sam sucking dick?  Are these your photos?  This is how we try out our Apple TV.  Really?  This is the perfect reason why I don't delete any picture on my phone.  You never know when you need it.  You just never know, right?  That's Sam sucking some dick?  Yep.  There's no other way to look at it, man.  What the fuck? 
[01:51:30]  Wow.  I have way too many photos that I can't have up here.  What?  Yeah.  Put it up there.  Oh, no.  Put your camera on, and then you can hit a picture, and then you'll see a different icon.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy's a little too scared to turn his fucking phone on right now.  Jimmy's petrified right now.  Just don't hit the right button, and then you're fine.  You don't have anything to worry about.  Pow, pow, pow.  All right, here's Christopher Colangelo and his most annoying 30 seconds.  Chip, Chip, this guy, what's it about? 
[01:52:00]  Well, I'm not.  You know.  I don't know.  What is it?  He's fixing.  Stuff like that.  Nothing.  People say I'm a sensation. 
[01:52:30]  That's funny.  Was that the best audio contest?  Something like that.  People say I'm a sensation.  This is hysterical.  Oh, that's cool.  Can you scroll through it?  Wait.  Hey, hey, it's fixed.  Will it just scroll your pictures?  Well, you have to scroll, scroll.  You must scroll.  How do you decide on which one to be shown?  Well, that's just it.  You got what?  You could pick them out separately.  Is there a safe zone of your camera roll?  But if you scroll your pictures, then they will just all scroll. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Because I don't want to accidentally upload my girlfriend's pussy.  I'm doing a couple things here.

[02:01:30]  adorable right here  look at this  look at this one  how cute is that  i got  oh that's a good one  it's a little  it's it's  when when my  little nephew  warren was a little baby  wearing a luftwaffe hat  jesus  he's adorable  what's the matter with you  what he's adorable  he's wearing a little  luftwaffe hat  it's authentic  wow  oh they're closing the curtains  oh they're closing the curtains  for our personal pictures  let's say hi to zach 
[02:02:00]  out of cleveland ohio  it is zach  what's up zach  hey guys  been listening since 9-11  i'm a really big fan  oh wow  that's a long time ago now  i know  well you guys  when 9-11 happened  and i listened to your guys  because i was so disillusioned  with everything else  and i was a man  anyway  um  listen  so in cleveland  you know rover  i know you guys have  some sort of relationship  with him  i don't know if it's good or bad  i always liked rover  i mean he's had me on  and i've always got along  with him  rover was always alright  in our book  yes 
[02:02:30]  you know he  he really did have a good show  for a long time  unlike maxwell  who's long gone  so that's good  i thought he got  i thought maxwell was back  uh he came back  but i mean  he has to play music  during his show now  it's it's beyond bad  oh okay  if you could take something  and make it worse than it was  i don't know how he did it  but he did it  congratulations to him  but anyway  so rover  started some beef  with this other radio guy  mike trevis  i know i don't know  if you ever heard of him  don't know  but  but he started some beef  like a week ago  and he's been on best of 
[02:03:00]  for the last week  he was on vacation  three weeks ago  so it doesn't seem like  he should be on best of  this week  and uh his wrote  his twitter feed  is very uh  cryptic right now  and i called the radio station  yesterday  and the other afternoon show  wouldn't tell me anything  so i'm thinking rover  might have gotten fired  or he's in some sort of trouble  so if you guys want  let me tell you something  for rover to get fired  rover didn't get fired  rover would have to  shit in his hand  and throw it at the pd  his fucking ratings  are pretty big there man  they're not firing rover  he does huge numbers 
[02:03:30]  if they're playing best of  he didn't get fired  right  so as you get fired  they yank everything  they yank everything  and they make believe  you never worked for that station  that's how that shit works  hey jimmy really quick  that's what i thought  but then i thought  what happened to you guys  in 2003  whatever that was  and uh  oh too yeah  you guys were so on top  and what happened to you  was such a travesty  so i think it could happen  to rover  even though  but hold up  they weren't playing best of  right  oh  and the difference by the way  is rover had an argument 
[02:04:00]  with another dj  this show  had somebody  ass fucking  in a church  allegedly  it was  yes allegedly  we started this lady gaga shit  it was a  well all i'm saying is  if you guys want to come back  to terrestrial  start in cleveland  now is the time  fuck no  is that it  jimmy look  i saw you in cleveland last year  i know you  i know you kind of  bash this  i know you like cleveland  but i know you guys  all kind of talk trash  a little bit  but um  at the same time 
[02:04:30]  you know  you guys need to come back  because  why would you say it that way  jimmy loves cleveland  i do love cleveland  we make fun of  we make fun of cleveland  of course you got to  but we we love the  fucking people up there  lunatic  the lunatic chicks  out of there  yeah well we we guys  miss you a lot  are we still talking about  cleveland  i know  but please anyway  check out what happened  to rover  because uh  okay  right  and anyway  have a good show  and uh  keep rocking  when you're longer  all right  i'm sure rover's fine  up  yeah i'm not firing rover 
[02:05:00]  for that  i mean if rover did  something really fucked up  but then they're not  firing him  for an argument  with another on-air guy  it's not happening  four-year-old served  a mudslide  at a chili in chicago's  at a chili's in chicago  whoops  what happened  a little four-year-old girl  was served a mudslide  you know  an alcohol drink  at a chicago chili's  she probably thought  it was tasty as hell  they didn't  yeah uncle paul  you like uh  giving them a  oh you go 
[02:05:30]  here you go  sippy sippy  oh you got a tote  take  you rub a little  whiskey on it  whiskey  parents actually did that  i know  rub whiskey on their  kids teeth  for a fucking  that's brilliant  my teeth get dry  i like whiskey on it  very dry  yeah  rover broke his arm  i'm on vacation  i guess  oh did he hear himself  so he's not back yet 
[02:06:00]  and then  speculate speculate speculate  yeah  rover's fine  we had the same agent  i'm sure i would have  fucking heard  if rover was fired  rover and i tweet each other  cockpicks  nice  what a couple of men do  i could show him on our  apple tv  absolutely  nothing wrong with that  two guys doing a little  fucking  a little  yeah a little fucking  time zone comparing  yeah why not  all right  hey uh  when we get back  we gotta talk about  the kids games  that are being banned 
[02:06:30]  huh  yes  yeah  spin the bottle  bottle  kiss the uncle  yes they're banning  so or or i think they  want more supervision  they just want to  more more stepping into  the lives of uh  they just want to  control you and your  family where  whereas years ago  it was fine  now of course  it's very dangerous  we'll explain after the  break because people 
[02:07:00]  have a lot to say  about this one  and it'll bring up  some of the games  we all played as kids  oh yes  this is the opian  anthony show  the virus  sirius xm  do do do do do  classic kids games  classic kids games  like kickball  yes  deemed unsafe  by state  in effort to  increase summer  camp regulation 
[02:07:30]  now they're  now they're  getting their  grubby little  hands into the  fucking summer  camp  yeah  bullshit  what the  fuck  man  i don't  get it  this is the  world we live  in now  my  and we're  old enough  to remember  we're old enough  to be around  to watch this  whole thing  change  remember all  the uh  the good  fun games  that were  uninterrupted  state bureaucrats  have identified  a potentially  deadly hazard  facing our  children this  summer  freeze tag 
[02:08:00]  freeze tag  this is what  they're fucking  doing with their  time  what the fuck  why is freeze tag  a hazard  that's right  officials have  decided the age  old street game  along with  wiffle ball  kickball and  dodge ball  poses a  significant risk  of injury  really  what the fuck  are they supposed  to do at  camp  sit around and  be sexually  abused  right by the  camp counselor  that's fine by the 
[02:08:30]  creep camp counselor  yeah that's  there's significant  risk of injury  there  they don't want  the kids playing  wiffle ball  or kickball  what a fucking  pussy nation  football i almost  get because you  can get paralyzed  you know  i almost  a football  you get your leg  broken but  kickball  yeah  you fucking  parents i don't  understand this  like i don't  understand why the  parents don't you  know have an  uprising  i'm a parent now  man i this is  what scares the  shit out of me  when my kid gets  older and i have  to put them into  a school system  and know what i 
[02:09:00]  went through as a  kid and what  they're not gonna  be able to do  you hear about the  the easter egg  thing they're now  called springs  spheres how dare  you say easter  springs  they're not even  eggs  the spring  spheres  they're called  springs i can't  even say this  fucking word  springs  i believe so  it certainly  doesn't say easter  anymore so it  might be spring  eggs or spring  someone help me  out a parent out  there  now you can't  even do easter  eggs or say 
[02:09:30]  easter eggs  did some jerk  off actually come  up with that  like spring  spheres i  believe  because easter  is you know  a religious  holiday  by the way  this is why  but see  half these  fucking  things aren't  aren't  aren't  religious  holidays  anymore  i don't  i haven't  thought about  jesus  during easter  for years  i see the  bunny  the chocolate  the eggs  i don't know  what any of that  means  this is why  american culture 
[02:10:00]  i don't think  christmas is a  religious holiday  at this point  american culture  is such shit  because we're  constantly  fucking  cowering and  backing off  from things  that became  very familiar  it's silly  we do this  break probably  once every  couple of  months and  the parents  are outraged  they're so  uprise  it's a minority  that is uh  thinking this way  it's not the  majority  they win all  the time though  the minority  i know that  the majority  is too busy  working and  just talking 
[02:10:30]  about their  lives  so wiffle ball  kickball  dodgeball  pose a  significant risk  of injury  and classics  like capture  the flag  steal the  bacon  does anyone  know steal  the bacon  you really know  what steal the  bacon is  i don't know  that one  we used to  play that  in my school  back in the  day where  it was like  uh you had  it was typically  in the gym  you'd have one  line of kids  on one side  one line of  kids on the  other side  and usually  like some  shitty teacher  would like  throw their  keys down  at some  designated  spot in  the middle  and everybody  would have  assigned a  number  so you would  pair up  with somebody  and they 
[02:11:00]  would call  a number  and the  first one  to steal  the bacon  would get  a point  nice  you had to  make it  back to your  line without  getting tagged  or something  i forget  what the  words  it's not  what it is  oh  what's  steal the  bacon  it's when  you all  don't start  laughing  it's when  you go out  and steal  kevin  kevin  bacon  put them  in your  pocket  or something  that's  impossible  chif  classics  like capture  the flag  steal the  bacon  and red  rover  are also  deemed  dangerous  and new  state  regulations  for day  caps  red  rover 
[02:11:30]  can you  tell me  what the  status is  on red  light  green  light  one  two  three  i bet  it's  but you  know what  it is  the kids  have probably  gotten hurt  and this  is where  parents bring  i guarantee  there's been  lawsuits  oh yeah  my son  skinned his  knee  and i'm  so it's  almost like  as much  as the  state  sucks  parents  they're not  going to  uprise  because most  of these  shitheads  are responsible  for fucking  suing  the lawyers  have  destroyed 
[02:12:00]  any  type of  entertainment  or fun  in this  entire country  and you can  see it  just by  looking at  over the  past  10  15  years  how many  of these  fuck  commercials  come on  for lawyers  every two  seconds  you'll see  a drug  commercial  and then  right after  the drug  commercial  is a  commercial  from a  lawyer  saying  did you  take a  certain  drug  call me  and  the  fuck  is  going  on  they  are  scumbags  but you  know what  it's easy  to throw  the lawyers  under the  bus  but they  do not  exist  in a  vacuum 
[02:12:30]  they exist  because people  use them  to sue  they made  it easy  they did  now people  in general  have a  basic human  nature  to try to  get something  for nothing  and if  something  happens  they are  instantly  going to  go  I want to  sue  but if  you had  a legal  system  that said  no get  out of  here  stop it  it's a  frivolous  lawsuit  they  wouldn't  be so  apt  to  try  to  sue  now  it's  no matter  what  happens  I  want  a  lawyer  get 
[02:13:00]  me  my  lawyer  and  they're  readily  available  on TV  you can  pop it  on and  find a  lawyer  in two  seconds  but if  you  didn't  have  a  country  of  pigs  who are  obsessed  with  grabbing  for more  than  their  share  in  greed  then lawyers  would  maybe  just use  the law  properly  so it's  kind of  you can't  let the  public  off the  hook  either  so  summer  camps  are  going  to  be  pretty  boring  I  wonder  if  you're  still  allowed  to  lezz  out  I  think 
[02:13:30]  they'll  be  lezzing  out  at the  summer  camp  down at  the  canteen  significant  risk  of injury  if you  lezz  out  you  could  pull  a  jaw  muscle  as  you're  lapping  another  girl's  clitoris  well  we got  a law  student  we got  more  to this  story  it gets  even  better  but first  a law  student  Tyler  New Hampshire  lawyers are  a product  of what  society  demands  of us  man  Tyler  what's up  Tyler  yeah  how's it going  hey  yeah  yeah  I don't 
[02:14:00]  like lawyers  in general  but  maybe  maybe  there's  maybe  some  young  lawyers  are coming  up  that'll  change  the game  a little  bit  because  without  them  we're  fucked  what's up  Tyler  how's it  going  hey  go ahead  buddy  I agree  I mean  I agree  I mean  really  what happens  is  you know  we go  into law  school  the debt  load  that it  costs  to go  to law  school  I'm paying  close to  60 grand  a year  after three  years  you're looking  at close  to $200,000  in debt  when you get  out  you're looking 
[02:14:30]  for clients  and people  hire you  for anything  and you take  it  and you need  to pay  those loans  back  within 10  years  so I mean  it's what  society  has developed  us into  a bunch  of  you know  money hungry  society  you said  society  wrong  we can't  allow that  on this  show  it's  society  wow  you know  he brings  up a point  when they  do  put him  in debt  so quickly  out of  school  that they're  just trying  to fucking  find anything  to make  a few bucks  right 
[02:15:00]  all right  binder  I mean  look  without the  lawyers  though  I mean  look  before  the  Miranda  rights  you know  it's  now  that we  get annoyed  because people  lawyer up  and they're  like  you know  yeah  you didn't  read him  his rights  but before  that  you know  you literally  were fucking  doomed  if you got  arrested  criminal  and civil  two different  things  and I'm  going out  on a limb  here  saying that  I understand  if you go  into criminal  law  you got to  protect  your client  civil 
[02:15:30]  lawsuits  and shit  like that  it's a whole  nother game  these fucking  scumbag  lawyers  know  that this  fucking  scumbag  money hungry  piece of  shit  is just  trying to  fuck someone  over  for free  money  the lawyer  gets a  great share  of it  and  you know  the parties  go away  happy  because  usually  some kind  of insurance  will pay  the part  of the  defendant  and  then you  know what  we all  end up  paying  don't  we  well the  insurance  companies  are pieces 
[02:16:00]  of shit  because their  whole thing  who's not a piece  of shit  in this  that's the point  you know what  everyone's a piece  of shit  the fucking  insurance companies  are garbage  and they're built  on taking your  money  betting  against you  getting fucking  injured  and then trying  to fuck you  out of your  benefits  but then again  people are always  trying to fuck  insurance companies  out of as much  money as possible  to by lying  so they have  to have  investigation  everybody is  a scumbag  in this  here's a great  thing I heard  over the weekend  was it what I 
[02:16:30]  just said  yes it was  exactly it  verbatim  a couple of  insurance companies  will give you  and here's how  they present it  which is great  again  something being  presented to you  as good  as something  that will save  you money  or give you  a freedom  they usually  present things  that will fuck  you in the end  but that's not  the real reason  right  the insurance  companies  a couple  of them  are saying  we could put  a sensor  in your vehicle  that will let 
[02:17:00]  us know  how fast  you're going  and based  on that  we'll give you  a lower rate  if you don't  speed  now doesn't  that sound  like alright  look I don't  speed  give me a  lower rate  and you put  this thing  in my car  and they'll  know how  fast I'm  going  who doesn't  speed though  everyone in  front of  me  the Asians  don't  speed  no the Asians  don't  speed  the Asians  don't  Asians  should  use this  you're the  goody two-shoe  people  yeah  but they are 
[02:17:30]  in the left  lane all the  time which is  weird it should  be in the right  lane not speeding  but whatever  but here's the  thing on this  one  Garen  fucking  teed  they used  that  in an  accident  case  to see  how fast  the person  was going  and then  deny him  any fucking  money  because you  were  irresponsible  hey  not only  were you  saving money  or not  saving money  whatever  you put  the sensor  in your  car  it's going  to be  used in  court  of course  so the  insurance  company  doesn't have  to pay  you 
[02:18:00]  because  you  were  breaking  the  fucking  law  guaranteed  their  fucking  that's  their prime  directive  yeah  their whole  goal  is not  to pay  out  fucking  cases  you know  it says  somewhere  that if  you're  breaking  the law  that takes  away our  responsibility  to cover  you  but then  again  are they  scumbags  for doing  that  because  the people  if you're  doing 65  in a 30  zone  you're not  going to  just admit  that if  you don't  have to  you're  going to  lie  so you  could be  fucking  the insurance  company  insurance  companies  in general  are scumbags 
[02:18:30]  they are  but you're  paying those  motherfuckers  top dollar  to insure  you  regardless  of what  happens  or doesn't  happen  as you're  driving  so you  feel you're  getting  fucked  but then  you're  fucking  the insurance  company  they're  making  plenty  of  fucking  money  we do  have  this  great  society  where  we  just  what  it's  based  on  everyone  fucking  each  other  society  society  it is a  fucking  but we  stand in a  circle  and everybody  points to the  right and  says you're  the scumbag  until it gets  right back  around to  you  none of us  want to  just say 
[02:19:00]  it is a  fucking  everybody  is fucking  greedy  and out  for themselves  and everyone  wants to  exonerate  themselves  and act  like hey  I don't do  that  I'm  the  good  guy  and  we're  all  shit  Carlin  said it  better than  I'll  ever  say it  he said  garbage  in  garbage  out  as far  as  politicians  that's  the  best  we  have  to  offer  hey  let's  get back  to this  though  so the  classic  kid  games  like  kickball  deemed  unsafe  by state  in Africa  to create  summer  camp  regulations  so we  continue  with the  story  here  classics  like  capture  the flag 
[02:19:30]  steal  the bacon  red  rover  are also  deemed  dangerous  and new  state  include  more  perilous  pursuits  like  archery  scuba  and  horseback  riding  in response  to a  state  law  passed  in 2009  what about  snoober  dude  is  snoobering  in there  boom  you got  your  snoober  I was  in  juvie  growing up  I stole  a  gumball  machine  so what  you  fucking  saying  boom 
[02:20:00]  so how  do you  think  it  should  be  changed  bob  you  know  what  you  gotta  change  it  boom  he'll  just  say  nothing  you  know  what  boom  you  don't  change  it  you  change  it  what's  the  difference  well  bob  the  difference  is  it's  either  changed  or  not  changed  yeah  whatever  dude  just keep  being  smarmy  what  bob  what do you  mean  smarmy  with technology  he's a genius  though  that's the beauty  of bob  kelly  how  we're  coming  with the  first thing  out  the first  day  it  comes 
[02:20:30]  out  yeah  damn  look at  this  app  it zaps  you  to  moon  wow  really  yeah  so if you go to a summer camp  you can't even do archery  no archery  why  horseback riding  that's like commonplace  why the fuck would you go to a summer camp  exactly  what are they gonna do  sucky so there's boyish penises in the cabin  obviously  now you're talking  what else is there  tight clamshell ball bags  under the new rules  under the new rules  any program that offers two or more organized recreational activities 
[02:21:00]  with at least one of them on the risky list  is deemed a summer camp  and subject to state regulation  ah  state regulation  so what the state wants to get a little piece of the action  a little more of the action  yeah they want to be able to put someone in there  she said the list  which labeled frisbee tug of war and sack races as safe  well sack races are hard  tug of war was never fucking safe  sack races  sack races weren't safe  no  not at all  no  exactly  you try to race  like you start with your balls on someone's forehead  and you try to drag your sack down to their chin 
[02:21:30]  so your assholes over their nose  oh I thought it was something else  what  I thought it was like  okay  that one's black  that one's hispanic  he pulled through  guess the race  sack race  oh  god am I dumb  guess  guess the race  oh  but you have to do it by scent  yeah  smells like cocoa butter  black  this broad 
[02:22:00]  this broad Diane Mathis  from the health department  that's sexist opie  she stressed that  not every program will need to hire medical staff  what's this about  so if you have these events  you have to have medical  yeah medical  like some kind of nurse or something  on site  so it's going to cost you a little more  to send your kid to summer camp  and that was for an indoor  this is for indoor camps  which was kind of  they said was a loophole  the outdoor camps  that have these sports  they do have  and have had to have 
[02:22:30]  a nurse  now the indoor ones  they're saying  you need a nurse  if you're going to be playing  kickball and dodgeball  so what is this really about  the health department  getting more money  yeah yeah  they're going to get one of their peeps in there  and it's going to cost you a little more money  and they're going to have to oversee it  Susan Craig  a spokeswoman for the city health department  said the new law is not expected to have much impact  since most city programs already meet the state requirements  you're right  okay and then you got parents like this idiot  kids these days are kind of brutal 
[02:23:00]  so I could see those games being dangerous  really  said Wainwright who has a five year old  I agree with it  you're the idiot  I remember  playing  you know dodgeball  yeah if your kid can't handle dodgeball  or any of these other activities  then you know what  write a note and say  my kid's going to be sitting out  exactly  when they play wiffle ball  what was that  oh no  there was a game  when I was growing up  it's still around I'm sure 
[02:23:30]  but it was football  but without those pesky rules  it was just the fun part of football  it was called  kill the guy with the ball  we called it smear the queer  smear the queer  we played smear the queer  and we didn't even know what queer meant back then  eh whatever  but I'm sure now you would be  found out by the end of the game though  sure  oh  the uh  yeah kill the guy with the ball  was just pretty much  uh  keep away  with a football  and whoever had the football  you'd fucking just smash him  in our case  if you had the football  you were the queer  you were the queer 
[02:24:00]  and you got smeared  but that didn't make sense  no  it just rhymed  because if you were brave enough to have  the football  you weren't queer  now were you  you weren't being queer  right  oh  maybe it was meant in an odd sense  you're the guy with the ball  so you are different  than the rest of the  when you played  uh  kill the guy with the ball  were you brave enough to grab the ball  oh yeah yeah  but I was one that would toss it off pretty quick  if  yeah yeah yeah  you know five guys are bearing down on me  you always had an animal that you grew up with  that were on the ball  and he would fucking take it to the limit 
[02:24:30]  I was more like you  I would  I would  I would  I would grab the ball  and become the queer for a little bit  I'd  isolate that  but I would uh  I would certainly get rid of the  rid of the ball  and allow someone else to be the queer  I'd have it long enough  when things got a little too dangerous  I'd have the football long enough  for where I wasn't looked at  when the game was over  like yeah  that guy doesn't touch the fucking thing  he doesn't fucking grab it  pick it up  yeah and then uh  you know  but I'd off it the second  people were coming after me  I would keep offing it off  and go 
[02:25:00]  I'm no queer  don't smear me  what did that mean  we had uh demolition derbies  on our bicycles too  sometimes on a weekend  you'd  you'd go out  and all ride your bikes  and just smash in each other  right  it was funny  right  like oh man  look I nailed that fucking guy  his wheel is all fucked up now  and it was just kind of fun to do  it was a fun game  what's that  jacks  it sounds very dangerous 
[02:25:30]  it certainly is  you've got to be very careful  I offer all sorts of options  at Ted's Jack's Emporium  oh  what kind of options  are there to jack stuff  oh there's a bunch of them  you go  and then you pick them up  sometimes I have like  a little glass playing surface  and a cube hall  but that uh  how do you bounce the cube  you don't  that's why I sell so many of them  they're breaking all the time  but how do you play the jacks then  because you've got to bounce the ball 
[02:26:00]  yes you do  yeah and then you pick up one  and then you throw the ball  but instead of bouncing it  it crashes through your playing surface  and then you're like  oh sugar  and the bucks start rolling in for me  you sure have a lot of schemes  yes I do  how much have you grossed this year  $1.78  but that's before taxes  oh okay  hey uh  this guy wants to know  a status on another fine game  that was played at summer camp 
[02:26:30]  oh summer camp  let's go to Alex in Chicago  Alex  what's up guys  hello Alex  I just want to know  does it say anything about Monster Rain  Monster Rain  let me see  we need a nurse on site for that  let me see  Monster Rain is still okay to play  yes it is  yeah that's safe  under the porch  a nice safe activity for the kids  under the porch  no teeth please  oh the government  has just  got to stop  with their bullshit  roll up and off shit  so you called it  kill the guy with the ball 
[02:27:00]  kill the guy with the ball  with the ball  I called it smear the queer  someone else is saying  it used to be called  maul ball  maul ball  that's uh  as in  as in  M-A-U-L  yeah  you didn't play it  in an actual maul  no  it was mauling someone  like a bear would maul you  how great would that be  to play smear the queer  in the maul though  go long  and then just  fucking plow into  a kiosk of scrunchies  Greg  in New Hampshire  you guys called it  maul ball  yeah  I used to call it  maul ball 
[02:27:30]  there used to be like  30 kids playing that game  after school  or like during recess  and uh  holy shit  it used to get ugly  a lot of bloody noses  a lot of scab knees  and elbows and shit  classic old school  playing  in recess  that's like  growing up though  you know  you'd play those  fucking games  I'll tell you  we were playing  I'm trying to remember  I think it was  smear the queer  to be honest with you  and it was the first time  I saw some shit go down  Billy DeCandito's  fucking  broken  broken arm  bone through the skin 
[02:28:00]  shit  yeah  and we were just  I don't even think  we were 12  first time you see  shit like that  it's like Vietnam  for a kid  oh my god  it's like you get  fucking post-traumatic stress  dude people just  started screaming  for their mommies  man  yeah yeah  there's Billy on the ground  no one's gonna help him  cause we've never seen  shit like that before  you're just losing  your fucking mind  good for him  he lived pretty damn close  so he grabbed his own  fucking arm  and ran home  we had this dumb kid  but we were horrified  yeah dumb kid in our  backyard was uh 
[02:28:30]  jumping from the  tree fort  to another plank of wood  that was in a tree  but the plank wasn't  nailed down  yeah  and he just grabbed it  and the thing went  seesawed  nice  and he fell  and snapped  his fucking leg  snapped the uh  the front one  what is that  the tibia or something  and it came  right through his shit  the bone came through  right  yeah  and we were just  in the backyard  like  like oh my god  we just felt like  like Vietnam  you wanted your mommy  you felt like  yeah  you didn't help him  no  what are we fucking  gonna do  who the fuck 
[02:29:00]  would help  put some leaves  on it  love that Brian  put some leaves  on it  run  but that's  you know  that was some  scary shit  back then  but you can't  I don't think  you could really  stop that from  happening  or can you  I don't know  they've made it  so you can't  fucking do  anything anymore  we've talked  about this  in the past  you used to  you know  you used to  ride your bike  around  or just fucking  walk around  hang out with  your friends  you don't see  any kids  out  playing anymore 
[02:29:30]  doing anything  you know  they're supervised  at a playground  or something  but you don't  just see them  riding their bikes  down the street  or something  it's really strange  it's frustrating  I've said this  living in the city  you see  you see  babies  in strollers  and you see  little kids  you see little kids  being held  by their mommy  by the hand  yeah  and then you see  17 year olds  yeah  like where are  the kids  between 2 and 17  that are 
[02:30:00]  yeah  just riding bikes  and I always  wonder if it was  a city thing  but you're saying  you see the same  thing in suburbs  you just don't  see kids out  you don't see them  I think it's  all fucking  computers  and Xbox  I think it's also  you know  all the top  parenting  they keep them  inside  it's very dangerous  out there  they're now called  play dates  instead of  get the fuck  out of my hair  and go find  something to do  now it's got to  be organized  ahead of time  just fucking  ride our bikes  from like  8 in the morning 
[02:30:30]  until fucking  10 at night  you'd come home  and just  and your parents  didn't know  where the fuck  you were  remember when  you were brave  enough to just  ride to the next  town  oh yeah  that was the  long ride  that was the  long ride  you felt like  you were getting  something done  fuck man  I've been here  but in a car  with my mommy  I never rode my  bike this far  well like when  me and my friend  Eddie rode our  bikes to New  Brunswick  and there was  some  we had our  fucking  Kango  black kid  hats on  and there was 
[02:31:00]  some black kids  outside the store  that were going to  beat us up  so I had to  call my dad  to come get us  and he had to  put our bikes  and he had to  put our bikes  in the car  oh no  like two girls  oh those  those darned  black kids  ruining your day  yeah they were  right though  we should have  had our  fucking white  asses beaten  were they  were they  why were you  in like a bad  neighborhood  or something  or  George Street  New Brunswick  it's right by  the stretch  factory  it was a lot  worse than  though  yeah  yeah  it's fine  and what'd you  think  you were gonna  ride with your  Kango hats 
[02:31:30]  and be all  badass  yeah we figured  we'd be kind  of down  like I never  realized when I  would hang out  black kids  would kind of  walk away from  me when other  blacks were  around  they'd be  embarrassed  of course  why do I have to  feel stressed  just because I go  into that factory  I never understood  the name of his  club  yeah what is that  you literally  I was like  what factory  I'm just going to  the stress factory  thing  I always feel  just stressful  going into the  doors  why am I  coming here  because it says  stress right on  the fucking  billboard  stress factory  why do I have  to feel stressed  probably because  you know you're  going to have to  talk to Vinny 
[02:32:00]  which is just  uncomfortable for  everybody  watch him do  his phone bit  on the stage  because he's  doing stand-up  for 20 years  and he still  has fucking  rough hands  so what do you  do in your  spare time  what do you  sleep with your  fucking hands  out the window  you're fucking  creep  he leaves his  hands on the  porch when he  goes to bed  he runs a  great place  but I always  feel stressful  walking into  that place  says it right  there  this is the  stress factory  what about  the game  hot bean 
[02:32:30]  I guess we're  talking about  kids games  now  this guy  hold on  before hot  bean  you're going  to have to  wait  because there's  no way this  guy really  played this  game  Paul in  Jersey  go ahead  I need to  know if  you're just  fucking  trying to  get on  the radio  or if  you actually  played the  game  no I  played the  game  I grew up  in Jersey  City  where there  was a lot  of Indian  kids  so we  would go up  on the roof  every Friday  because that's  when we got  allowed  we used to buy  a whole bunch  of tennis balls  we used to go  up on the roof  of my house  and we used to  hit as many  Indian kids  as we can  we called  a Hindu  sniper  body shots 
[02:33:00]  were two  points  head shots  were three  points  and if they  cried  you got a  two point  bonus  well that's  very racist  it is man  that's like  cool  that was  fun  it was fun  as a kid  it sounds like  it could be  sure  as an adult  we get  tolerant  my friend  fell off  the roof  so we had  to stop  yeah  well thank you  sir  does that  article mention  anything about  the status  of undie flip  and or  peenie flip  oh  undie flip 
[02:33:30]  or peenie flip  peenie flip  is still okay  to play  wow  what about  undie flip  and undie flip  did not make  the list  as well  sir  Travis  you're okay  you can still  I can still do it  now as a 30 year old  you can still play  your queer games  well I don't think  they're queer  you want to play  some undie flip  in my house later  why do we have to  wait till we get  to your house  good point  okay  can you reenact  undie flip  just for the radio  absolutely not  why  come on  I'm not gonna  get nude  in front of you  because there's  no ceiling fan  here  oh  we could have  Bobo reenact 
[02:34:00]  undie flip  I'll do it  in my house  with a pot and  pad  do you know  it was a fun game  I would play  with my friend  I imagine  it won't be popular  with this group  no  I don't even  want to look at  dick sucking  you know what  it's an excellent  guess Dan  and we would  we would count  the sucks  like if you  would give him  ten and he  would give you  ten  like one  two  really  yeah  and you owe  me three sucks  you had a  yeah you had a  you did not  play this  I most certainly  did  and believe me 
[02:34:30]  we kept count  because you never  wanted to be  gypped on sucks  everyone wanted  to be the receiver  you certainly  nothing worse  than someone  trying to  gyp you on sucks  who went first  that was like  the lucky one  that got it first  because then you  could just go  I'm going home  did anyone ever  gyp anyone out  on all sucks  that would suck  I don't remember  honestly  it's so  it's in Edison  I live there  I would assume  if you sucked  one more  than your friend  then you would 
[02:35:00]  be gay  no we didn't  we just knew  it was dirty  if it was equal  sucks  then you just  knew it was dirty  yeah we knew  we knew what gay  was but none of us  but that's not gay  no  you weren't having  emotional feelings  no we didn't  hold hands  you just wanted  to get sucked  hey I want  10 sucks  I'll give you  10 sucks  I'm with you  it's not gay  how many sucks  am I going to get  how many are you  going to give  would you play  that today 
[02:35:30]  would you bargain  back and forth  like that  I don't remember  like 10 sucks  15  alright  what if  15  what if you made  cumzies before  the 10 sucks  no one made  cumzies back then  he couldn't  cum  I don't remember  erections  I didn't know  if we got erections  I remember  the first time  I saw an erection  I didn't know  what it was  like my friend  would get it  but I wouldn't  and I had no  idea why  what happened  to that thing  I didn't know  what it was  it's like  I'm only giving  fucking one suck  for every two  you gotta give me  with that thing  I would go for  two for one deal 
[02:36:00]  if he had a boner  well I didn't realize  that bargaining  was a possibility  for playing for sucks  did the 10 suck game  end when  your friend got a boner  that's a different  friend  that's a different  friend  he was like a  year older  ah  one year older  he was getting boners  yeah  boners  so why don't  so why don't you  want to use the  Apple TV again  Jimmy  oh I don't know  I just  it just seems  like let's see  when you play music

[02:37:30]  the kid game  thing is stupid  yeah we played  what is it about  tax dollars  you think  taxes  revenue  you know  that's part of it  I think part of it  is also just  these dopey  fucking politicians  and shit  wanting to make  it seem like  they're doing  something  and the parents  look at it  like oh good  they're protecting  our kids  I bitch to  parents  that have  small children  and none of  them are  into what's  going on 
[02:38:00]  with their  kids  so how do  you change  it back  to sort  of how  it was  you don't  you just  deal with  it  yeah  we need  a complete  revolution  I think  in this  country  unfortunately  I hate  saying it  but the way  things are  going  I had that  discussion  too  we're absolutely  heading toward  that  some type  of major  revolt  has to be  done  but is it  though  here's what I  was thinking  as we went  to the bathroom  you played  that CeeLo  thing on the  Apple TV  and I kind  of forgot  like yeah  I kind 
[02:38:30]  of like  that tune  I just  went to  my iPhone  and I just  went and got  it from iTunes  and I was  listening to it  on the way  to the bathroom  and I'm like  how fucking  amazing  can you imagine  in 1950  if you told  someone that  you were literally  going to hear  a song and  just pull it  out of thin air  it's like  you're pulling  shit out of  thin air  and they'd say  is it a  colored person  yes  and they'd say  no I don't  want that  you'd say  it's a CeeLo  and he was drinking  out of the same  water fountain  but it's  almost like 
[02:39:00]  as much as  it's annoying  what's happening  in this direction  it's fucking  amazing  what's happening  in the other  direction  you're right  so there won't  be a revolution  the technology  side of it  is amazing  our financial  and social  part in this  country  is a fucking  disaster  technologically  yeah but that's  worldwide  technology's worldwide  you could pull  fucking music out of  the air in England  India  wherever the fuck  you are  Japan  yeah maybe  Japan  Denmark  yeah there

[02:46:30]  sticking  their  fucking  nose  in  everybody's  business  again  they don't  give a  fuck  if you  gamble  they just  want to be  able to  control and  get their  share  that's what  that's  about  they don't  care about  the  individual  how dare  them  they don't  give a  they think  casinos are  going up  all over  the place  now  they don't  care  if people  bet their  life savings  but what  they do  care about  is not  getting their  taste  absolutely  right  and that's  all that's  about  yeah  don't make  it sound  like you're  helping society  motherfuckers  wasn't this  offshore shit  yeah  and they found 
[02:47:00]  a loophole  because the  offshore people  were making  way too much  money without  our government  getting a taste  yeah  they said  that they  were making  their money  and claiming  it as  well they made  a law that  said that the  banks  the american  banks  couldn't do  business with  these  offshore  banks  and that  wasn't good  enough  because they  found a way  around it  meanwhile they  do fucking  business with  libya  and other  countries  the fucking  nerve of  that  why am I  being so  indignant  it's just  nervy  of the  government  to do  that  it's  infuriating 
[02:47:30]  is what  it is  they don't  give a fuck  if you  destroy your  life gambling  they do  business  with countries  that  sponsor  terrorism  and they  eventually  put them  on a list  and don't  do business  with them  but who  the fuck  we do  business  with china  china is  just  notorious  when it  comes to  fucking  with people  whose human  rights  record is  despicable  their  fucking  their  environmental  record is  despicable  we do  business  with them  we won't  we won't  do business  with somebody  that's  helping  somebody  decide  if they  want  a  third  ace  that's 
[02:48:00]  not  our  business  I made  my point  I'm repeating  myself  shut up  get online  and play a little  poker  and it was always  just  it was fun  man  I'd get online  and you could  go online and play  for no money  for fake money  really can I  so when I'm  fucking betting  my fake  one thousand dollars  or one thousand  chips  when I bet  my fake  one thousand  chips  and another  guy calls me  because it  doesn't cost  him anything  what does that  mean 
[02:48:30]  it's not  playing real  poker  real poker  you have to  have money  backing it  because that's  the only thing  that shuts  people down  and yeah  they got me  for you know  I had a few  bucks in there  nothing over  not even a  so why are they  taking everyone's  money on top  of it  they froze  the account  seizing the  account  are they going  to give  everyone their  money back  of course not  illegal activities  you're taking  part in  so you're not  getting shit  back  my pal  brother  we must be  on suicide 
[02:49:00]  watch  that's all  he did  that's all  he did  when he wasn't  doing radio  but you know  what the other  thing is  I bet you  the government  sets up their  own online  poker sites  they do  there's too much  money in it  you play the  stock market  I was just  going to bring  that up  fucking  e-trade  you sign on  to your  e-trade  account  and trade  stocks  it's  it's worse  than online  poker  as far as  money going  back and  forth  opening bell  by the way  there it is 
[02:49:30]  the market's  open  looks like  here's Paul  Paul's very  upset we lost  the online  poker  Paul  PA go  hey that Paul  hey it's  actually Andrew  how you doing  hey quickly  the Flyers  they win last  night  you know  I'm just  driving through  I'm actually  from New Jersey  I love how  these guys  just don't  watch their  sports from  their town  it's the  weirdest thing  where's  not from  there  oh you're  just driving  through  where are you  from  I'm sorry  your phone  was a little  fucked up

[02:50:30]  dude you're  right about  them wanting  their taste  because  they know  every fucking  dollar  you make  or lose  from the  stock market  they don't  you lose  the government  never stepped  in  when you  people have  lost their  life savings  how many  people lost  money a few  years ago  when the  market crashed  and committed  suicide  yeah hey  we ought to  maybe stop  people's  ability  to trade 
[02:51:00]  like that  and all  that weird  shit was  going down  a couple  years ago  they were  aware  they knew  that shit  was happening  they're gonna  make it legal  but it's gonna  take a minute  two years  they say  and you know  first of all  they're gonna  lose interest  but you know  why ban it  until you're  ready to go  live with  the regulated  poker that they  can collect  taxes on  yeah whatever  you said  if your phone  wasn't fucked  up  yeah we  I could  what did  you say  you have to  call back  now his phone  is really  bad  we're gonna  give up  on him  all right

[02:53:30]  to be looking at  Portal  Portal 2  actually yes  please  we're looking at  the face on Mars  I was kind of  hoping it was  real  I know it's not  there aren't  Martians  no no no  but there was  supposed to be  what is the  thing that looks  like a man  made or  creature made  tube  there's something  on there that  looks like a  glass tube  like a long  tunnel or something  that was constructed  a water slide 
[02:54:00]  one kind of  like a slinky  a slinky  Richard Hoagland  is such an asshole  he's the guy  that's obsessed  with this fucking  Sedonia thing  oh yeah  but it really  has been proven  to be fucking  mountains  I almost said  fake  mountains  as real as  you can get  well the  yeah the shadows  and the way  that the angle  of the photo  was taken  made it look  like a face  on Mars  and then when  you look at it  from different angles  and lighting  you realize  it's just mountains  it's a little  mountain chain  did you see  the sunset  on Mars  I did not 
[02:54:30]  no  it came out  yesterday  is it nice  it's really nice  looks cool  it's just creepy  because it's so  crystal clear  it looks like  the sun  looks like the sun  setting in a desert  but it's Mars  how the fuck  do they get that  it's pretty cool  I was watching  part of Colin's  special last night  oh my god  like the last  half hour  fucking great  I was watching  that and laughing  is that the sunset  on Mars  there's a ton  of these  because we do  have equipment  that's there  that's one of the  rovers took that  I guess  I thought he was 
[02:55:00]  fired  somebody  somebody so  lived there  do you think  at one time  do you think  it's a planet  on its way  that's the one  I saw  look how fucked  up that is  the sun's  pretty far  the sun's  far away  well it's a little  further away  right  yeah  you can't breathe  on Mars  or is it a little  closer  there's an atmosphere  but I forget  how that works  yeah  you gotta put your  hand in the  thing  but first  you have to  open your  mind  open your 
[02:55:30]  I got  Jimmy  I don't think  Jimmy's seen  Total Recall  yes I  get your  ass to Mars  can we play  our Total  Recalling  song  that picture  looks fucking  cool as shit  man  which one  that's amazing  it is amazing  is Mars  closer or farther  yes  that's right  from the sun  farther  by one  by one  we had to  give up on  that planet  move forward  yeah Mars 
[02:56:00]  ain't shit  there was some  shit on these  planets  you think that  like is going  out and that's  that's the one  that's like was  earth and now  we're earth  like you know  and then and  then Venus  will step up  laugh if you  will we came  from somewhere  else  well you know  they said  laugh if you  will  I think Neptune  and Uranus  they say  Uranus  that's how  we say that  now  what happened  to Uranus  I don't know  now kids can't  make the jokes  over the years  Uranus  they really say  Uranus  Uranus  yes Uranus 
[02:56:30]  they were just  sick of 12 year olds  making fucking jokes  they'd rather make it  a piss joke  than an asshole joke  that's what happened  Uranus  they switched orbits  I forget  they just know  shit  that they switched  a couple of the  planets switched orbits  probably because of  collisions with  meteors and stuff  that sounds very scary  yeah  yeah  but they fucking  switched  it's so far away  how far are our  voices right now  you think  I'm sorry  our voices are way  out there now  when we first  what broadcast 
[02:57:00]  yeah  I think  Hitler was like  the first  was the huge  first video  broadcast or no  no I'm talking  about us  oh like  when we  now  like when you're  a kid  say you're  nine years old  with a walkie  talkie  does that count  no  no  right now  like how far  wait  I'll tell you  there's a satellite  right with the  Sirius XM  yeah  so isn't our  voices way up  there right now  to come back  down here  speed of light  what year did you  start together  94  bullshit 
[02:57:30]  17 years  speed of light  that's what I'm  doing  yeah  17 years  speed of light  that's where our  voices are right  now  yeah  and then you  just say  where  what  102 trillion  miles  is where our  voices are right  now  from 94  Jimmy's lying  it was too fast  I would have  believed you  if you  spent a little  more time  but we've done  these math  problems  previously  and you've  never gotten  one that fast  I challenge  anybody 
[02:58:00]  to correct  my math  how about  this one  there are  structures on  the moon  as we do  the math  problem  type in  John Lear  do you know  John Lear  yes I do  at his moon  structures  I interviewed  him  we just  go home  John Lear  moon structures  into YouTube  102 trillion  miles  your voices  since 94  have gone  sure  I'm looking  for John Lear  I said  and don't 
[02:58:30]  make me come  over there  for you too  tough guy  he makes  jets  oh Lear jet  it's very good  John Lear  I met a  football player  oh  here's  moon secrets  revealed  can we put  this on  John McCain  oh man  isn't that  great  you know  we can see  you going  around  while they're  mining the  moon  this is seven  minutes  going to  Mars  I'm bored  already  billions of  dollars  billions of  dollars  does he 
[02:59:00]  supposedly  have like  moon bases  or something  structures  on the moon  there's no  structures  on the moon  no one  lived there  no one  did anything  we went  there  we were  there  we put  things there  yeah but  they were  there before  us  nah I think  we just  put shit  there and  there's  nothing  there  but  craters  there was  other  stuff  light  travels  180,000  miles a  second  I believe  right  so I  believe a  light year  is six  trillion  years  I've  done  the  math  or  I've  read 
[02:59:30]  it  so  17  times  six  is  102  trillion  miles  you had  the math  so what  is 102  trillion  miles  away  from us  your voice  is  because  you're  I want  to know  how far  it is  like I  can't wrap  my mind  around that  I gotta  know  if we're  swinging  around  I'll tell you  what you've  passed  in 17  light years  all you need  is the number  17  you've passed  I believe  alpha and  proxima  centauri  were the  nearest stars  I forget  which one  is the  nearest  one  so we've 
[03:00:00]  passed  some stars  and shit  4.2  light years  I think  is the  nearest star  so they're  right now  they're hearing  hey  masturbator  no they've  heard that  13 years  ago  it's old  hat to  them  there are  pests on  fucking  proxima  centauri  wow  so why don't  we do  this  where's  alpha  for the  people  we apologize  remember 17  years ago  hey  masturbator  we're sorry  for that  we're sorry  for that  that way  in 17  years  they're going  to get  their  apology  we get  it  right now  on the 
[03:00:30]  planet  someone is  going  who's  OJ  what did  he do  and someone  else is  going  he's a  you know  what  and the  guy's  going  oh  oh  on the  planet  Murfner  no you're  saying it  wrong  you sound  stupid  when you  say it  oh I'm  sorry  it's  planet  Murfner  you're not  straining the  left side of  your neck  you're doing  it wrong  Murfner  no you're  not turning  your head  you're going  Murfner  that's a  mockery  it's  planet  Murfner  that's as 
[03:01:00]  good as  you're going  to do it  you just  can't speak  Murfner  is Japan  really  sinking  what  no they're  radioactive  yeah  and are  they sinking  how could  they sink  Japan  is sinking  at a rate  of two  feet  a year  you just  don't know  what to  believe  why would  I make  that up  because  you just  make things  up  fair enough  I did  I don't  know  it's more 
[03:01:30]  than two  feet  now  right  some  places  is it  Kissin  Studio  working on  a new  album  oh  god  Arnold  Schwarzenegger  says he  said he's  not young  anymore  oh  the  governor  why  did he  does he  regret  wasting  his time  as the  governor  and not  making more  movies  I don't  know  enjoying  his life  he enjoys  life  he could have  squeaked out  a couple more  action flicks  he'll do other  movies now  he'll do  fucking dramas  where he'll play  the guy  Michukaku  check it out  finally  oh really 
[03:02:00]  god I have the  worst timing ever  with that one  the day before  the tsunamis  we fucking  hung up on that  motherfucker  and then he  did every  TV show  after that  yeah  but what  was he  really  saying  we didn't  know  you know  oh by the  way I saw  him on a  special  on discovery  or something  where he was  talking  he was doing  physics calculations  because they're  talking as we  all know  I'll be very  quick  yeah  we all know  that the theory  of relativity 
[03:02:30]  Einstein  and quantum  mechanics  has trouble  marrying  that's the  problem  is quantum  mechanics  can't figure  gravity  and theory  of relativity  can't figure  like little  teeny teeny  teeny things  so they're  trying to  marry it  through string  theory  old hat  we all know  but I saw  him doing  quantum  physics  like calculations  where he was  saying that the  problem with  Einstein's theory  of relativity  is it breaks  down  it's like  it comes to  infinity  times infinity  and woo  was he a  smart fuck 
[03:03:00]  when he was  doing that  shit  didn't figure  that into  it  go ahead  see  that's the  answer  right there  Anthony writes  x2c  equals  24.1  times z  in parentheses  which means  if you have  two cookie  people  and one  is chocolate  Anthony  will not  eat it  right  that's what  that means  boy I had a  great idea  for a joke  I'll say
