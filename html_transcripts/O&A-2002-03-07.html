<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a song about killing kittens, followed by production woes and a discussion of the *South Park* season premiere, specifically its portrayal of AIDS and Jared from Subway.  The hosts then promoted the upcoming “55-gallon drum challenge,”  detailing plans for a Titanic slide for a future event and discussing Earl’s proposed “Black Rock Coalition” radio show, debating artist inclusion across genres and races.  Jim Norton called in, discussing his disastrous *Cribs* episode showcasing his squalid apartment.  Lewis Black also called in, sharing his opinions on video games like *Grand Theft Auto 3* and *State of Emergency*.  The show heavily promoted the 55-gallon drum challenge, including a Wrestlemania giveaway and a bizarre new sponsor commercial, with mentions of “12-year-old Gary” and other individuals playing minor roles.  

A humorous, sexually suggestive commercial for “Dream Cream” followed, with the hosts discussing having various people, including studio guest Steve from FoundryMusic.com and Jimmy Norton (in a female role), perform it. Rick James then arrived in studio.  

The in-studio interview with Rick James covered his legal issues, drug use (freebasing vs. crack cocaine), time in Folsom Prison, relationships with women (including Linda Blair), career, songwriting, and the success of "Party All the Time."  The conversation was highly sexually explicit and offensive, including racial slurs and stereotypes, and references to his *Behind the Music* episode.  Callers like Joe (mentioning Monsoon) and others contributed to the conversation.  The segment also touched upon a perceived lack of change in "ghetto life" across generations, shifting drug use and fashion. Rick graphically detailed his first sexual experience at age nine, sparking further calls, including one from Mary mentioning his upcoming book, "Confessions of a Stupid Freak," and Dave comparing his sexual conquests to Wilt Chamberlain's. Ozzy Osbourne called in, engaging in a bizarre conversation with Rick James about drug use. Several callers shared anecdotes and banter, with Malik recounting losing his virginity while listening to Rick James’ music and requesting to be a guest.  Another caller discussed a supposed U.S. Army invasion of Asbury Park, jokingly attributed to Rick James and his "crack posse."  Ken shared memories of James' lavish lifestyle, followed by Kevin, claiming to know James and his family. Numerous other callers contributed brief, often profane and sexually suggestive conversations.

The show revisited the 55-gallon drum challenge, offering $2000 to the winner and discussing Jim Norton's acting struggles. Mona phoned in, engaging in a sexually suggestive conversation with the hosts.  The “Dream Cream” commercial was replayed, followed by a humorous re-recording by Jim Norton and Steve C, presented as a gay couple. Further promotion of upcoming segments concluded this section.

The broadcast then featured a segment involving a disgustingly filthy studio toilet, culminating in a female guest, Steph, licking the inside of the bowl while Norton held her hair.  Following this, news stories were discussed: a heart surgeon killed by a metal plate from a truck, and a nurse's aide who left a man impaled in her car for two days before dumping the body. The "What Did We Learn Today?" segment followed, featuring sexually suggestive and vulgar calls, including a teen’s "queef" sound.  The show ended with further promotion of the 55-gallon drum challenge, including women participating in bras and panties, and the Wrestlemania trip offer.  The broadcast was rife with profanity and sexually explicit language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Show blows monkey ass.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I'll do this one for all the animal lovers since they like gerbil so much.  Uh-oh.  It's a sing-along too, so everybody feel free to... 
[00:00:30]  Join in.  A little bouncing balls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting  It helps a lot if you kill a kitten  Mark my words, cause from where I'm sitting  You can't go wrong if you kill a kitten  Look at those balls. 
[00:01:00]  There's no crime that you'll be committing  I know the law, you can...  Everybody!  Kill a kitten  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting  You'll get plenty when you kill a kitten 
[00:01:30]  Feed it turpentine  Or break its spine  Crush it with your shoe  As long as long as you kill a kitten  Kill a kitten  Listen up  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten  She'll like you better when you kill a kitten 
[00:02:00]  And I'll quote the Bible  Cause that's where it's written  If ye loveth Jesus  Ye must kill a kitten  Throw him at a train  Make him snort cocaine  Drown him in a lake  Bake a kitty cake 
[00:02:30]  Flush him down the can  Hit him with your van  Stick some tea and tea  Up his cut booty  Do what you must do  As long as you  Kill a kitten  Kill a kitten  Meow  Kill a kitten  She got to kill a kitten  I feel like me  Alright 
[00:03:00]  Killing kittens isn't easy  And if the thought makes you feel queasy  Grab a pitchfork from the shed  And kill a puppy dog instead  Kill a kitten 
[00:03:30]  You got to kill a kitten  A little furry kitten  You got to kill a kitten  You got to kill a mother  You got to kill a son  Kill a little  Kill a man  To 8-6-7-5-3-0-9  To 8-6-7-5-3-0-9  Reel  Steven Lentz everyone 
[00:04:00]  Our buddy  Our pal  We haven't played that one  In a long time  Nair  That one gets the animal rights activist going  Ho ho  Where are my templates?  It's not their brand of humor  Is this your brand of humor?  We're plugging in machines as we speak  To start the O.B. and Anthony show  The most unprepared radio show in America 
[00:04:30]  Yeah  Almost ready to broadcast  Some days  Some days it's easier for our guys to get in here  And set everything up beforehand  You know what I mean?  Nope, yeah  And other days it's like  We got to come in at the last minute  Because, uh  I don't know  There'd be a brawl or something, I guess  A brawl  Not worth my time  There's a whole list of people 
[00:05:00]  I'd rather punch in the face before that  Hooray for AIDS  Hooray for AIDS  Hooray for AIDS  Hooray for AIDS  Hooray for AIDS  That's awful  Yep  Yep  Uh-oh  I think this is a bad idea, fellas  I feel woozy  My bad 
[00:05:30]  My bad  I love when we get new clips to play on this radio show  Especially a brand new South Park clip  Oh, I'm getting steamed now  Butters  Butters rocks  I don't know about this, fellas  Man  Oh, gee whiz  I'm not watching television, Dad  I'm just laying around jacking it  That was Cartman's impression of Butters 
[00:06:00]  What a hysterical South Park last night  The season premiere  And Kenny apparently is just dead  He's done  They're gonna bring him back at some point, maybe?  Of course  Yeah  Something's going on with that  God, that was funny  Oh, come on  Japanese girls do it  Eating his vomit  Hoo-hoo, sorry  You're gonna give children AIDS? 
[00:06:30]  Chef  Yep  Yeah, they totally did a great spoof on Jared and Subway  On South Park  Stupid blubber butt  I don't know about you  But I cannot take those goddamn Subway commercials  You're looking good  Damn it, Butters, keep eating  Or else I'll kick your ass till you're deader than Kenny 
[00:07:00]  Dude, that isn't cool  You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead  Enough time hasn't passed  So how long until we can joke about it?  22.3 years  That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny  That's a long time to wait  That was the whole issue at last night  AIDS, finally funny  You're finally able to joke about it  Because enough time has passed by  You know, I don't want to play the rip-off game  But I kind of sound a little familiar  Hoo-hoo, go break your thumb and shut up  We've talked about that many, many times 
[00:07:30]  I know  I've never heard it discussed before  Enough time passes  It's been written in some of the articles we have done in the last six months or so  Things just become funny  We have said many times on the show  If enough time has gone by  It's okay to joke about something  Well, that's pretty much the Titanic slide  That we have discussed many times on the show  That we want to get for some event  In the future  I think next big outdoor event we do  When the weather gets nice  We are going to rent that goddamn Titanic slide 
[00:08:00]  Because that seems like the most fun you could have  With a huge disaster that killed thousands  But we'll have girls topless sliding down it  Yes  Just to give it that  That Opie and Anthony angle  And like Jack  I'm going to sketch the nude women  As they slide down the deck of the Titanic  How great would that be?  Hold on  It's amazing how slim you can get with AIDS  I bet you can  I bet you can  I bet you can  You're looking good 
[00:08:30]  Jared eating the sandwiches  Do you want to hear the Philadelphia?  Yeah, this is really funny  South Park did a great job last night  They really did  But Jim's not happy about that  What's wrong, Jim?  I thought it was actually very funny  Again, if you're a cartoon  You can say anything you want  But they, you know  Don't make fun of this  Don't make fun of  Comedy Central really makes me sick  So you're saying Comedy Central  Because they allow South Park to get away with all that stuff  To do anything  And I don't want to hear  They air late  Stupid  And then they edit your act 
[00:09:00]  No, no  You can't talk about Butcher  Not just mine  Everyone  What line  A lot of it  It's just annoying  Every time I hear South Park  I want to vomit  It's a very funny show  But, you know  They better make fun of prosthetic legs  And the woman's telling me  Of course, a woman  You can't make fun of prosthetics  Even though we all know they're hilarious  There's nothing funnier than someone with a fake limb  Falling off as a fire breaks out  And of course, what a funny thing 
[00:09:30]  That one of my age lines showed up on South Park  Now this thing that you guys have talked about  Showed up on South Park  That's a real coincidence  How's your thumb?  It's not broken  Okay, just wondering  What happened?  Well, how come?  What's wrong with me?  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys  Watching it last night  And the age joke that kept running  I was getting sick  I thought  It was just a horrible joke  Why don't they just shut up  And move on with it?  And then they brought him a dead horse  And it was just  These guys are brilliant  I've got to tell you  Oh, when Jerry was beating the dead horse? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, the whole joke was that  He lost weight with the help of AIDS  But the little side joke  Was that he got a couple of guys  Who were his AIDS  That helped him exercise and eat right  But they just kept pounding the joke  Into the ground  And right when you started  Really getting annoyed with it  They show Jared beating something  On the ground  And you don't know what it is  And then they pull the shot back  And you see he's beating a dead horse  That was really brilliant  All right, Joe  See you, bud  Bye 
[00:10:30]  Boy, those cartoons sure are edgy  For me, for AIDS  See, Jim  For me, for AIDS  You know what you're doing  You're getting mad at South Park  No, I'm not  You should get mad at the people  Of Comedy Central  I have no problem at South Park  Especially when, you know  Because we love Matt and Trey  They've been on the show many times  We have a love-hate relationship with them  Not anymore  When was the last time we spoke with them?  Oh, I am not very happy with those two  Huh?  It's bad  Yeah, it's kind of bad  Why is it bad?  I don't know  They're still upset  At what? 
[00:11:00]  At the K-Rock thing a couple of years  When we hung up on them  Whatever  Really?  Are they mad enough that they wanted to take your concept  Of, you know, it's okay to make fun of it  After X amount of time  They don't seem to mind that  But they couldn't be too mad at you  Obviously listening to your show  Or someone who writes for them is  Alright, calm down, Jim  I'm over in South Park  I'm tired of it  Wow  We're back to having fun  And being in a happy mood  We're in a happy place  I'm in such a happy place  We're in a happy place  Fun to come in  Alright, we have lots to do today  Yes  We have Rick James coming in at 4 o'clock 
[00:11:30]  Nice  Rick James  We have to talk about the 55-gallon jump challenge  Which goes down tomorrow  Tomorrow  I can't wait  And the contestants are talking smack  Already  Already with each other  So we're going to get some of the contestants on the line today  Maybe we could get Rick James' opinion  And some pointers on imprisoning girls  While we torture them  Hey, that's a good idea  That's interesting  He has a little experience at that, right? 
[00:12:00]  Maybe he could  Can we burn them with a hot glass pipe bowl?  I was going to say  Maybe he could, you know, help us out  And give us one of his crack pipes  We'll burn Olympic rings on the girls' arms  With a hot bowl of the crack pipe  Yeah  Why not?  Mr. James should be allowed to explain his side of the story first  I am thrilled to death that Rick James is coming in today  I want to hear everything  I'm fascinated with the story of Rick James  Is he going to talk, though?  That's what I'm hoping  If he doesn't talk open and honestly  Because, quite frankly, you know 
[00:12:30]  It'll be nice if he does talk and open  And then he can get his plugs out for whatever album he's got  Do you have an album coming out?  I don't know  I don't either  So it would be good for him if he was able to do that  I'm assuming that he's pushing an album  But I don't want to hear it  Unless he comes clean  And really opens up and discusses  I want to hear about the torture with the girl  I want to hear about prison life  I want to hear about his time in prison, yes  I want to hear about that  Buffalo's own Rick James 
[00:13:00]  Buffalo?  It's a little local reference here today  Wow, how about that?  I believe he grew up on the fruit streets  I want to hear how he  A section of Buffalo  How he fouled Linda Blair  I want to hear that  I want to hear that  How Linda Blair went from little Reagan  In The Exorcist  To squatting on that baby's arm  Clutching an apple  I got the fact sheet in front of me  Oh, you do, do you?  Some of the things we could talk to Rick about  Born and raised in Buffalo 
[00:13:30]  His mother ran numbers  I don't know how he feels about that  His mother ran numbers for the Italian mob  Really?  He joined the army at 15  15  He formed his first group in Canada  With Neil Young, Anthony  Who saw that coming?  And then all the stuff you obviously mentioned  Yes  And he had a stroke  In late 1998  Someone addicted to crack  Having a stroke after a while?  I'll stop it  The one thing I have to say  Have you guys ever seen Earl 
[00:14:00]  As excited for any guest  We've ever had  Coming into this radio station?  Earl's a big Rick James fan?

[00:28:30]  There's so much mold  And stuff in the bathroom  Yeah  Is because  The landlord  Had never fixed the shower  So it leaks hot water  At night  And you can't  I mean you turn it  Until your hand hurts  And it's still leaking  Like a steady stream of water  Oh really?  So there's constant moisture  How long has that been happening?  Yeah that explains the shower area  Yeah  What about the holes in the ceiling  That drips water  When it's raining outside  While you're trying to watch TV  I'll tell you what the rest  Or what about the black mold  Behind your pictures  That are hanging 
[00:29:00]  What about the powder puff stuff  The Barbie doll chocolate bars  Or whatever you have  I can explain  What was the Kleenex  The Barbie Kleenex  What about the  The book on sexual predators  On sexual predators  I can explain all of it  And I know this doesn't look good  Right  To some people it looks great  I think  You know  Ant and I have been working  With Jim for a long time now  Yeah  It really has been a long time  Well over a year  Dice introduced us  To Jim Norton  I think yesterday 
[00:29:30]  Ant and I finally hit our  Hit our limit with you  I looked at Ant  When all of a sudden  Rick or Steve said  Yeah and we found this book  On sexual predators  Like oh boy  Ant and I looked at each other  Like we thought we heard it all  With this guy  That scared us a little bit  No I'll tell you  I'll explain  All the  Oh yeah  The chocolate  The Barbie stuff  That's all my roommate's girlfriend  Who I live with  Oh sure  I live with a guy  With you know  Jim and his girlfriend  The mold on the walls  Is because it's a piece 
[00:30:00]  Of garbage apartment  And the water leaks in  There's nothing you can do about it  Except clean  Which I'm not going to do  No mold in my bedroom  I'm not saying my bedroom's clean  It's a disgrace  But there's no mold in it  And the book on sexual predators  I love stuff like  On serial killers  Who doesn't  It is a fascinating subject  Bad whacking material  Yes  I love reading about  Edmund Kemper  And Bundy  And all those guys  All those fun guys  Yeah  So that's why I have that  Was it a  Times bestseller 
[00:30:30]  This book  I don't even know  I just got  Can you find it in  You know  Barnes and Noble  Or do you have to go  Into those special  Little bookstores  I got that from a girl  I had been seeing  Who had the book  What as a birthday gift  No no  She had it  And I was like  Yeah let me borrow this  A while ago  Yeah  And I just never gave it back  And then we stopped seeing it  Why did she have it  She's a good girl  What was the name of the book  I honestly don't remember  No  It was on the floor  And what about the mail  That's piled up a foot high  Dude I was worried  About anthrax 
[00:31:00]  That's weird  That's a little weird  But there's bills in there  I paid a lot of my bills  But I mean some of it  It's just like old foam  I mean I paid them  But it's just  I panicked  You just during that time  When it was going around  The anthrax  You figured best  Better safe than sorry  I panicked  I just  That old bag in Connecticut  The  What was her name  Oglethorpe  Oglethorpe  Something Oglethorpe  She caught it  You know  When she was 90  Yeah  She wasn't a target  So I mean  I'm a 36 year old  33 year old actually  You know comic 
[00:31:30]  I know I'm not a target either  But  Alright  We're also wondering  What you hid  Before the cameras got there  Nothing  Did anything  Absolutely nothing  Did you look around  And go  Alright they're coming  Let me just get rid of this  Yeah  Because I think we all  Would do that  If they were coming  To my place  To film a cribs  There's definitely  Things I'd be like  You know what  I don't want to share  This or this  Or that  Yeah  But with you  You didn't hide anything  Absolutely not  Everyone's got something  Nothing  No  The videos I was showing  I only pulled out  I don't actually own  That many pornos 
[00:32:00]  I own some  But not that many  I don't watch  Porno mags or anything  There weren't any  Porno mags in your house  In your apartment  Not really  No  Wow  Alright  Alright well  It'll be up on  Foundrymusic.com  I hear it's going to be great  Jim Norton's Cribs  Absolutely  Coming soon  To Foundrymusic.com  You'd have stuff though  Around your house  That you would go like  I think everyone would say that  Yeah  Maybe  Not even that weird  But just stuff like  Stuff you just don't want  People to see maybe 
[00:32:30]  Boy  If they see this  They're going to call me a fag  Oh wow  That's  That's going to be tough  To explain  It's like the bit  Of fag  Really  What item is that  I don't even know  Seriously  I don't even know  But I mean  If I looked around  It's like the Bill Hicks bit  About if he died  Right then and there  What his parents would do  If they came over  And just started looking  Through his old things  And gathering up stuff  And opened his closet  And just saw all the  Pornography that was in there  I think a lot of people  Probably have things  Laying around  You know 
[00:33:00]  I wouldn't be too proud  If my mom came over  And saw some  Japanese animation porno  That sucks  That stuff sucks  Not because it's dirty  Or anything  Because it's poor quality  Porn that's horrible  Mom would probably  Want me to have  Some better pornography  What's wrong with him  There are no facials in this  Oh it hurts  Don't put it there  No  The twisted part  That's all that porno is  There's brother sister  Stuff in that  Oh please  Oh brother  I've never had it 
[00:33:30]  No  Oh brother  You have grown  That's right  Now lay down on the bed  And I will show you  No  Oh  It hurts  That stuff sucks  It was the worst  You know how hard  You know what  Can you bring that in though  Yeah  Because the audio  Is worth playing on  We will  And there's definitely  Some stuff that  We could play  Where you know  Oh yeah  Without worrying about  The SEC  You can even just  Bleep a couple of things out  If it's hardcore  Because the voiceovers 
[00:34:00]  Are so bad  Because I guess  Originally it was done  In Japanese  And then for the  American market  They went with the English  And it just doesn't  Translate as well  And it's pretty funny  It would definitely  Be worth checking out  Horrid pornography  Alright  Anthony before Rick James  Gets here  We got to play  Louis Black's  Back in Black segment  From the Daily Show  On Comedy Central  Yeah well  We have him on a lot  Good friend of the show  He got arrested for us  Once with the  Voyeur bus incident  And he was talking  Last night about  Video games  Now we've had him  On the show  While we were 
[00:34:30]  Discussing video games  He's clueless  The guy is clueless  When it comes to  Computers  Or any kind of  Gaming system  So his take on  This whole thing  Is really funny  Because it's a guy  That just knows  Nothing really  About video games  And he's talking  And he's talking  About things like  Grand Theft Auto  And State of Emergency  Games that are  Just pretty much  Go out  Kill everybody  I'm going to go  Out on a limb  And I don't think  Louis Black understands  The youth of America  And how we  We  I'm going to make  Leave on the youth  Hello 
[00:35:00]  But how they think  Right  I think I understand  How they think  I've always said  And I said this  In the office  The other day  Hanging out  Drinking a few beers  Stinkies back there  I go  I definitely am in  Some state of  Arrested development  Yeah  Like I think  If I was  Let's say  20  Right now  And my mental age  Was the same  As it is now  I mean  Back that far  By that many years  I would be considered 
[00:35:30]  Retarded  He has the  Yeah he's 20  But he's  He's got the mind  Of like a 5 year old  So he's completely  He's profoundly retarded  You know  The drooling type retards  You know what  The reality is  Opie and Anthony  Never had to grow up  We need to admit  That to everybody  The fun thing is  Don't get me wrong  It's a pisser man  And a fun  But people that come in here  They hear what we do  On the air  But then when we leave  The air  When we're done  It's pinball  It's drinking 
[00:36:00]  It's stupid  Video games  It's that  Or it's going back  Into the office  And throwing things  At each other  It's third grade  If we ever lose  This radio show  We are so effed  In the real world  It's not even funny  I don't know  How to function  In society  With people my own age  Like what would you do  I don't know  I don't know  Radio show ends tomorrow  What would you do  What would we do  I don't know  I would have to  What  Go back to  Knocking 10  Know what I would do  Seriously  I would go right back  To the Huntington Crescent Club 
[00:36:30]  And caddy a little bit  Tell people stories  About how you used to be Opie  Oh yeah  Oh god is that sad  Until I figure it out  I would do that immediately  But after that  I would be dead in the water  I don't know  I could see me up  In a hot attic  Banging away on  Some sheet metal gun  Do you remember  Opie and Anthony show  Yeah  Because this is it  You know  I used to be Anthony  We're not working  Toward anything  Like if this ends  It's like all the skills  We brought with us  The last eight years 
[00:37:00]  We've worked together  Done  It means nothing  In the real world  Nothing  Well I can  I play pinball  I'm up to level 46  In EverQuest  If that's  One of my resume stuffer  And I can drink beer  And throw things at people  I could review video games  Yeah we can do that  We could talk about  TV shows  And movies  I could tell you  How to make  I am picky  Very happy  When do I start  When do I start  My job  Here  I'm not qualified 
[00:37:30]  What happened  I was qualified  For a pretty good job  And then  With this  In radio  You know  On top of that too  Let's try  Let's say we try  To go legit  Let's say the radio show  Ends tomorrow  And we try to go legit  Like hey  We want to go into  The corporate world  Get this job  That job  You know all the crap  We've said the last eight years  Is going to come back  To haunt us  Done  We would have like  This amazing resume  That we'd have to fake  Obviously  And then they would  Pull out tape  Like yeah  Yeah we were thinking  Of hiring you  But remember  Back in the year 2002 
[00:38:00]  And all the stuff  You said about the Zeeks  Yeah  Yeah that wouldn't be  Good for us  Any aspirations  To politics  Have been completely  Wiped out  Oh yeah  His  No that's a pretty  Good idea  He has for the state  If he wants to  Run for that office  Isn't it true  You used the word  Jigaboo  Did I  What was the context  What was the context  Of the term  Jigaboo  When you heard me say it  Right  I don't believe  This should interfere 
[00:38:30]  With me running  For this office  And I was doing it  In character  And waddle doodle  I apologize  We have a videotape  Of you guys  Doing something called  The  Wiffle ball  That challenge  Yes yes  Oh  Oh that  That  Yeah  How will this affect me  Is there an office  I could run for  Against Gary Condit  Because I think  I might have a shot  Against that feller  We didn't kill anyone  Message to Gary Condit 
[00:39:00]  Tell us where she is now  Yeah you lost  He'll never  He's a worm  You have lost  So it's time  To tell us  Where she's buried  He's not a worm  You don't think so  I love him  And he shouldn't have won  What do you think  He did  You know he was involved  With the disappearance  Of that girl  Yes he was  He knows more  Than he's telling  Of course he does  He's probably involved  It's time to tell Gary  No let him go  Let him  Let him go  Alright so we were  Talking about Louis Black  And we got him on hold  And he's a very busy man 
[00:39:30]  So let's play his  Back in Black segment  From last night  Yes  It was hilarious  Talking about the video games  Yeah gaming  Grand Theft Auto 3  And other things  Check this out  Reality  If you're like me  You spend every waking moment  Trying to escape from it  And recently  I've discovered something  That's better than reality  Video games  Okay so I'm 25 years too late 
[00:40:00]  At least according to my calculator watch  Look at this thing  It's a watch  And it's a calculator  This is amazing  PlayStation 2 has made  Tremendous progress  In digitizing my fantasy life  For example  Here's Britney Spears  Dance Feet  In which you audition  To be one of Britney Spears  Backup dancers  Come on now  That's right 
[00:40:30]  The best you can do  Is become a backup dancer  It's the perfect game  For people who disappoint themselves  Even in their fantasies  Now  Even though dance  Is my first love  I was looking for a game  With a little more panache  And by panache  I mean this  This game is called  State of Emergency  It's high-minded premise 
[00:41:00]  Puts you to work  Taking down a fascist  Multinational corporation  That controls the country  And how do you do it?  By walking into a shopping mall  And shooting anything  That moves  You see  One person can make a difference  And nothing sticks it to the man  Like taking out a Cinnabon 
[00:41:30]  Now if senseless bloodshed  In the name of anti-corporate activism  Seems a little too goody-goody  For you  Then how about  Senseless bloodshed  In a moral vacuum  This is Grand Theft Auto 3  The object of this game  Who cares?  I'm too busy  Randomly hitting  An old lady with a bat  Carjacking a station wagon  And running over people 
[00:42:00]  Or my personal favorite  Running over the person  Whose car I just stole  With the car I just stole  Now this is a video game  Rescuing the princess  Is for pussies  Thanks to PlayStation  I can kill, maim, steal  And still have time  To be a Britney Spears  Backup dancer  It's a good time 
[00:42:30]  To be alive  God damn Lewis  Hey Lewis  Hey guys  That was hilarious  I watched that last night  I was dying  Your reactions to  The clips they were playing  The Grand Theft Auto 3  That old woman's getting  Beaten over the head  With the baseball bat  Have you played that one?  It's one of my personal favorites 
[00:43:00]  And I have it in my game console  PlayStation 2 at home  And it is so good  To come home from work  And after you've been in traffic  And play that game  Yeah, my favorite is  The picking up the hooker  And then choosing whether to kill her  Or to sleep with her  Yeah, you could have sex with her  Oh no, no, no, no  Lewis, you don't get it  You could sleep with her  And then you could kill her  And take her money  And then take your money back  That you just paid her  Well, that's good  Isn't that fun?  You guys are good  I could barely get the guy  Into the car, okay? 
[00:43:30]  Now, you actually played this game  I played that game  Then, the sickest thing  Was this  We went up  I went over there  The other afternoon  And Paul Mercurio and I  And Rory, who produces it  Were standing there  They were going to see if I could  You know, they were going to  Put one of the pads out  We were going to end with me  Being a Britney Spears backup dancer  Yeah  I was completely  It was like watching a child  With some sort of a  Motor dysfunction  I was pathetic  I wanted to pee on the mat  You did, did you? 
[00:44:00]  I wanted to  Lewis, it seems like  You don't get gaming  I do get gaming  I love gaming  I'm just terrible at it  You know, you're talking about  The guy who was on  Ben Stein's Money  And didn't get a point  But he couldn't operate  The little  The sticky thing  But it seems like  You don't really get  Grand Theft Auto 3  Oh, I love watching it  But I can't do it  No?  No  You've got to practice  At it a little  It's so much fun  Once you get the hang of it  And you're just flying  Through intersections  T-boning cars  Oh, I know  But I was like  You know, you've got to realize  I'd only played 
[00:44:30]  Half an hour  And then most of the time  I was just, you know  I was basically spending  Time jumping from car to car  Because I was destroying  My own car  I'd kill a couple of pedestrians  And I'd have to jump out  Because my car was smoking  But then I'd like sit there  And watch it blow up  Which is the best part  Yeah, that is the best part  Did you walk around  And just beat up pedestrians?  Oh, yeah, of course  Yeah, that's a lot of fun  When you just punch them  And start kicking them  Until they bleed  Did you get the sniper rifle  And just go in the park  And just kill people?  No, that would require  More motor control  Than I'm good at  No, we'll give you 
[00:45:00]  Some cheat codes  Yeah, once you get  The cheat codes  And get the sniper rifle  You just hang out in the park  And you shoot people's heads off  You forget  You forget what the  You know, the  The reason why you're playing  Grand Theft Auto 3  If you get the sniper rifle  You don't really  You don't really care  If you complete missions  And stuff at that point  You just  Just random killing  You just want to kill people  But I've been traveling around so much  I didn't realize  How huge a game it is  Oh, yeah  Did you hear the applause it got?  It went nuts  I was in complete shock  I was like  No!  No! 
[00:45:30]  You're applauding a game  Where you just kill  It is by far  The hottest game  Out there right now  I had no idea  They can't keep it on the shelves  Oh, man  They really can't keep it  On the shelves long enough  How long  What's the longest  You ever played it?  Oh, my God  Hours  We've had many hours  Of discussions  About the game  On this show, Lewis  Yeah  Yeah, because  Well, Rory  Who does the  You know, helps us  You know, does the clips  And stuff  And is basically  The kind of producer  Of the segment  Who got the game  And took it home  You know, because  We were going to  Then it was 
[00:46:00]  Seven hours later  He said  Yeah, oh, yeah  He said  Took him  Once he hit the streets  Two hours  To realize  That he still wasn't  In the game  Yes  You start thinking  You can do that  That type of thing  When you're driving  Your own car, you know  Yeah, I know  And that's the thing  That I'm really  Looking forward to  Yeah  When I come on the show  To discuss that  Yeah  Yeah  So much fun  Is this from the game  Oh, yeah  They all got radios 
[00:46:30]  In the car, Lewis  I know  That I could work  All right  That I could do  Remember years ago, Lewis  When you were younger  The video games we had  Where it was like  A little bit of pong  A little pong  Then you and your friend  Would turn the game off  And you both just  Spit in each other's hands  And help each other out  I don't remember that part  But sure, why not  And I can't believe you  Norton  Sits for going  Condit's okay  Dude, he's a classic  You completely lost  Your moral grip 
[00:47:00]  Lewis, he handled the situation  What do you mean  He handled  He handled  Well, in Norton's world  He handled the situation  Dude, you see how  You see how these girls get, man  They want to talk about it  You know, they do you  A little favor  Now they're going to talk about it  So Gary said  Well, you're not going to  Talk about it  And wreck my political career  Little blabbermouths  Yeah  They're little blabbermouths  I bet you  She learned her lesson, though  Yeah, I just, you know  Suck  And then keep your mouth shut  Exactly  Yeah  Gary needs to tell us  Where she is now  And I don't think 
[00:47:30]  You guys have to worry  If actually  If you guys went off the air  Because of Norton  You would have to be hired  To do something  Norton's the bottom line  As far as I'm concerned  Yeah  We can't have him  But you two  Come on over here  Yeah, right on  Somebody to pitch hay  To the horse here  At Central Park  Hey, Lewis  Are you still living  In the same place?  I won't say what street  The same place?  Yeah  Oh, I'm right down  The street from you now  Are you really?  I'm moving into New York  Everyone's moving  Into New York City

I've been fascinated with the life of Rick James  I've got to tell you  Oh, don't hear me out of Rick  Not many people  Rick, you've got to be  I mean, please  Not many people have gone through so many things in their life  As you  You know?  Hopefully they don't  Well, yeah  Well, some of this stuff is great  I mean, I love the whole thing  Especially when that song was popular  You know  From what I could see  You were knocking them down left and right 
[01:05:30]  You know?  A lot of girls  Hot chicks  Of the day  Just clamoring over you  Yeah  And you were living the life  Yeah  And then all of a sudden  Living the high life  All of a sudden  All of a sudden what?  This story comes out  Behind the music  Yeah  This story comes out  That  Here's a guy that's getting chicks all over the place  Then a story comes out that  Have to force a chick to have chicks  Right  And I'm like  Now, come on  Think about that  I want you to  I want you to think about that one  Exactly 
[01:06:00]  It's like  Why would Rick James  Who is getting chicks left and right  Then have to  Force someone who loves drugs  To do drugs  There you go  Something is not wrong with this picture  Exactly  It seemed a little off  Well, see that's  You know  That's one of the things  Behind the music  Failed to mention  I think  I was pleased with it  Behind the music  You were?  Other than the fact  I was pleased with it  Yeah  Other than the fact that  A lot of the stuff that went on  That was sealed by the judge  The DA didn't  And the DA's are bribing witnesses 
[01:06:30]  And giving witnesses  Drugs and TV  Really?  Things  Oh yeah  A lot of stuff went on  It did  Yeah  And I mean  Anyone in the right mind knows  I really  I really have to force a woman  To have sex  Yeah, I really have to do that  For some reason  And I really  And I really have to force them to  To  I really have to force  Girls who have been kicked out of  States because of their drug addiction  To do drugs  It seemed to me like  I have to do that  It was people 
[01:07:00]  It seemed to me like it was  Just a group of people  That enjoyed doing some drugs  And having some sex  Got together  And all of a sudden  She freaked out  Well, no  What it was was  She came to my house  She came to my house  With his other girls  Six in the morning  I guess she told the jury  She came to a cocktail party  I always have them  At five in the morning  She's right  And um  And we  And we were  You know  We were hitting it  We were on the floor  In the closet somewhere  In the first half an hour  Anyway, she stayed for like 
[01:07:30]  A month and a half  A month and a half  And I  I guess  A long ass cocktail party  I guess when she finally  Went back to her  The hell of a party  Yeah  When she finally went back  To her pimp  Or her man  He was a little pissed off  And uh  And she came out  With the story  Yeah  And uh  You know  It was much more to that  I mean  I got a book coming out  Called Confessions of a Super Freak  When we're going to expose  A lot of the stuff  That the judge hit  And um  A lot of that stuff  There were a lot of stories  Of uh  Like torture though  That were  Yeah, right  I'm Marky Desai 
[01:08:00]  Right  I torture every woman  Sure  Let me just believe  That it's true  Because you're my idol  Sorry  You know  I love the concepts  You know  I mean  Yeah  Marky Desai  One of my favorite characters  In life  The images  That's the Bugs Bunny  And uh  Yeah  Every woman  I think I've ever had sex with  I think I've  Tortured, maimed  Cut, stabbed  Yeah  The images  That it kind of  That's why there were  So many lined up  Around the courthouse  And uh  Right  Rick James  Just going nuts 
[01:08:30]  And uh  Torturing a woman  The images  It kind of  Was like  Wow  Oh I have to torture me  What the hell is going on  With this one  Look  Before we make love  They have to get tied up  And tortured  And stabbed  And poisoned  Now that makes sense  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That sounds like  Norton's date  Yes  I don't spank  I don't spank butts  I just  I brand them  Is that it?  So there was no torturing?  Uh  Sorry for all of you  Essendon freaks  Who lying out there  With your whips and chains  Nah  I'm sorry  Now they  You have to go see Prince  For some reason 
[01:09:00]  The jury didn't buy this  No they didn't  And they sent you  Away  Well  Really  Now you were doing  At the time  You were into  Doing crack  Is that what  No no  I don't see  That's another thing  I hate to say  I really  I hate to say  I don't do crack  I don't do crack  And didn't like crack  I free-based  Of cocaine  You know something  A lot of people  That free-based  The coke don't like  When it's called  Doing crack  No no  It's much more  Free-based and cocaine  A lot more civilized  Than doing crack  So I'm politically  Correct  To say free-based  It sounds cooler  It sounds cooler 
[01:09:30]  It's a lot more  It's sure  I'm free-basing  For those out there  Who think crack  And free-based  Are the same  You're a fool  Yeah right  Yeah that's why  They cost to say  That's why you  Go buy a crack  For ten dollars  And a hundred dollars  Free-based  Very refined  You go out  You get your ether  Ammonia  You mix it up  See there you go  Going back to the old days  Reliving those times  Reliving those old feelings  Rick I gotta say  I partook in a little  Free-based cocaine  Myself back in the 80's  I partook in a lot  Of free-based cocaine  And I'll tell you one thing  You're here to talk about it 
[01:10:00]  It did make you feel good  But it didn't  Yeah  And as soon as you did it  You wanted to burn  And torture someone  Didn't you  Well yes I did  And I captured a lot  Of people  And tortured them  And were sent up  And they're still  In his basement  Did you ever get high  With Richard Pryor  Did you ever get high  With Richard Pryor  No matter of fact  When I sang  With Richard Pryor  He used to do that drug  That's what made me  Not want to do it  Yeah  See for a long time  I was totally against  I mean we used to  The storm cocaine  In the 80's  All the time  Who didn't Rick  And at every session  Every time we recorded  It was like 
[01:10:30]  It was like the end thing  To do  You hang out  Studio 54  And you know  We'll play them  And you  Or Paris  Wherever you go  And you snuggle cocaine  But I used to watch  People really change  And Richard was one of them  Man  Richard used to get  Really weird  Off prebation  And girls would like  Take out all these  Bottles  And baking soda  And ether  And all this stuff  And I never understood that  So for a long time  I was down on that  Yeah  I really cursed  The day that I started  I went from spending  Like  Who showed you  The rebase 
[01:11:00]  Who showed you  Well what happened  Was I was sorting  And I was spending  Like I don't know  Two or something  Thousand  Housie  And writing it off  Jose Coco  Some strange name  Well write off  Right  And then  And during the street  So we went to Chicago  And I don't want to name  The organization  But you know  They were a political  Organization  So the guy came in  And he had this  Big  Case  And it opened up  Like four ways  Right  And  These pipes 
[01:11:30]  And all this stuff  And he says  Have you ever done this  And I said no  And then he closed  The case back up  I said what are you doing  He said well  I'm not going to be  The first one to turn you off  I said  I was just kidding  I was just kidding  I've done that before  I've done it before  I was just kidding  And he opened it back up  And I had  One of my security  It was about six foot six  And he said  He had tried  And he lied to  And so they made  This stuff up  And he took a hit of it  And he fell flat  On his back  Yeah  And I says 
[01:12:00]  I gotta have that  Everyone remembers  That first big  Puff of freebase smoke  And I never quite  Got an outfit  But I did hire someone  To go on the road  And cook it up for me  Yeah  And all these groups  Used to steal him  Because he would cook so good  He was the good cook  Why are you making me  Remind me of all these  All the guys  Because it's interesting  Wait  So there was just a guy  That followed you on towards  And that was his  And he cooked  And that was his own job  Yes  Yes  And his job was to cook 
[01:12:30]  Molly Crue told us  That they had a drug deal  That would just fall  Matter of fact  He was so good  He was so good to cook  He would cook up the coconut  And the water would be invisible  And he would go in the room  And bring back another rock  Oh man  How about that  He was very good  What did he use the eyedropper  And get this stuff out  And put it on a slate  Or something  He was just  He was just a really good  Cooking thief  And he was just  He was just a really good cook  And all of these  Rock and roll groups  And people used to steal him  Didn't you realize 
[01:13:00]  Rick after the first hit  You'd never get  Quite as good a buzz  The whole rest of the night  You know what  I couldn't understand the high  You know  It was like  It was like  When I first  When I first rebased  I didn't understand that high  No  It took me three  Four or five times  To really get it  I don't understand  I've got to get a grasp  No really  Because when you  Sort it  I mean bam  You know what it's like  Okay  But when you  But when you start smoking  And you don't understand  Something  You're trying to say  Well what is the big deal  Yeah  And the next thing  You're spending five or six thousand dollars  A week on the big deal  And you wonder 
[01:13:30]  Then you know what the big deal is  Yeah yeah right  It's called addiction  A little serious addiction  Wow  So you were going through  A lot of cash  Yeah  And kind of got you  Into a little bit of trouble  I guess  Well you know  Well that happened really  All the trouble was  It came forth  Like my mother was  I was on California  And I brought this house  And Mickey Rooney's there  And it was a beautiful place  As a matter of fact  I was going to say  It took me like four months  To realize  I had this beautiful rose garden  On the side of the house  I got to just stay to my 
[01:14:00]  You know my mother was dying of cancer  At the time  And I really didn't care about  Living and dying  So I brought a lot of  Degradating people around me  And I didn't really care about  Who hung around you know  And it was mostly  You know a lot of women  And there was a lot of degradation  A little self-destruction  Yeah and it was  You know I didn't care  So I brought a lot of people around  You know I was  I was cruising for a bruising  You know  Yeah  I was headed straight forward  I didn't really care  So when all of that went down  It really saved my life  I mean you know 
[01:14:30]  Because really it was  It was a curse  Turning to a blessing  Because  Well sometimes stuff like that happens  And you end up dead  Instead of  I mean the judge  The judge wanted to  You know  The judge wanted to give me  Like three lifetimes  And I was like getting high every day  And snoring  And going to sleep  Three lifetimes  How do you do three lifetimes  Will you like die  And come back  And do like another lifetime  If you were able to come back  You would have to go back to prison  Yeah he was calling me  All these names  Charles Manson  And I'm on the other side  How much time did you get  Well really what I got was 
[01:15:00]  I got five years  But it was suspended  Into like eight months  At a drug thing  But when I went to the drug prison  I didn't know that the  The head of the prison  Was allowed to exclude you  If you had violence  You know  And there was violence  On my record  You know  And so she excluded me  Which means  She put me out of that  And I'm kind of glad  Because I  Had I done that eight months  I would have been on parole 
[01:15:30]  Probably  For the rest of my life  Damn near  Yeah  So she said  So I went to  She excluded me  And I induced for five years  And I did close to three years  At Folsom Prison  Three years  In Folsom Prison  Which was fantastic  Believe it or not  Really  Yeah  What's the experience  I just want to hear  What your experience was  In prison  Oz  God damn Oz  Give a lot to Oz  Oh man Oz is kindergarten man  Oz is  Oz  Oz  Oz is kindergarten man  Oz is kindergarten 
[01:16:00]  What does Rick James think now  When you  You're brought into Folsom  Now here you are  A guy that had a hell of a  Freaking career  I was the last one  And I was the last one  Off this bus  Right  And all these guys  Are shackled  Being dropped off  In prison  And I'm the last  I got this little bag  And the cop tells me  He realizes I'm Rick James  He says  Wow  If I knew it was you  I would have gave you  An extra bologna sandwich  And I said  Well you know  Thanks a lot  And I get off the bus  And these 4,000 guys 
[01:16:30]  Are in this yard  And all of them  Stop and come over  To the fence  Uh oh  And I started yelling  Yeah Rick Mary Jane  We'll be with Mary Jane girls  Come to my cell  And I'll rob rob rob  I said uh oh  Like who do I hook up with  Oh what's really going on  But you know what  It was an experience  Because  Um  I grew up  Uh  I got a chance  To kick  Kick the drug  Um  I got  I wrote  Most of 300 songs  When I was there  Uh 
[01:17:00]  I always said to myself  I needed like  2 or 3 years  To clean out  You know  And I could have  Gotten high in prison  I mean there's  There's plenty of drugs  In prison  Uh  But like you really  Want to get hired  With a bunch of dudes  Around right  I'm used to get hired  With 4 or 5 women  Drinking Cristal  In the sauna  And laying in the pool  Butt naked  That's the thing  You're going from that  To now you're  You know  Those bars slide down  Yeah  Bubba and everybody  Next door  You know  What was going through  Your mind  Did you go like  Oh my god  Where the hell  Did I F up  You know what 
[01:17:30]  It took me  I had  It took me a while  To sober up  Really  And by that time  I was like  On my way to Folsom  I mean  No  I had gotten out  Of the CRC  Which was that  Narcotics prison  And I was on the way  To Folsom  And reality  Said  Because Folsom  Is like  A bestia  Or it looks  Like an old castle  It's a very famous prison  They sent me to  Yeah  They sent me to  The very worst  Well let's send me  To the worst place  We can  Because that's  For the world  And Folsom  Was it  But  And the seals

[01:19:00]  And they  They would ask me questions  You know  And I worked in the library  And you know  Put a lot of them down  On reading and writing  And it became an experience  Man  It became  It became a really nice experience  What did you do  To satisfy yourself  You make up one of those  Wash claws  With a glove in there  And we heard about that  What's it called  Man  You know  Black people  Don't do that kind of stuff  What's that  What was it called  Do you remember  I forgot  No no  What is it  You should have a good grip on it

[01:20:00]  Hey do they bend over  On the other side  Of the bars for you  No they open the bars up  And then they bend over  I think it's more erotic  If you do it through the bars  So far fright  You want a little piece of this  I had a cellmate  We had to kind of  Keep it cool  Yeah  But no I mean honestly  What did your cellmate do  While you were getting banged  He wasn't around  They'd tell you  They would open up the cell  And they would tell me  To come to a room  Oh so it's like  You're going on  Official business somewhere  Yeah  You know  In the middle of meetings  Exactly  And then the room would come up  And go drink some wine 
[01:20:30]  And have some steak  And you know  Eat a few other things  Get some  Yeah get a little bit  God damn Rick James  How much did they charge for sex?  Huh?  Were they charged for the sex?  No one even  Charged  Charged  Charged  It's Rick James  It's Rick James  Yeah  Charged  They're just doing it  To get some of the Rick James  No what it was  Was there were  There were a lot of  Folsom had a lot of like  Lieutenants that were female  And sergeants  Yeah  And they had clobber  You know  So if they wanted me out of my cell 
[01:21:00]  Two in the morning  Or three in the morning  They would just come  And you know  Say we want to talk to them  In private  And never do that  But you don't think I  You don't think I played?  Wow  Did all the other  Guys in the prison  Asked to smell your fingers  When you got back  From the meetings  Or anything?  Because that would be like  Rick  Rick goes  Put the fingers out  I gotta sniff that digit  Where they use the dream cream  You would have been  Watching eyes too much  Yeah  You eyes out  That show scares  The bejesus out of me  I would never even  Want to go near a prison 
[01:21:30]  Forget about it  Everyone seems to be  Getting it in the can  Somebody told me  Yeah because of that show  We're not going to be  Torturing any girls  Anytime  No no  No way  I was up for a part in Oz  And the people  Told me  Everyone that does  A part for that  Has to appear nude  That's what it seems like  Right?  No well that's what it is  Yeah  And I say  Really?  That's totally ridiculous  I mean it never happened  But I mean  I really didn't want to  Go through that  Prison experience  Again  Are you too shy  To be nude on TV  There Rick?  No but they're going  To pay me more money  Than what they were offering 
[01:22:00]  He has a legendary  Oh my god  We've all heard  The stories  No but you  But you guys  Are the first guys  That really  I mean  Well I just told you  It was the truth  That happened there  Yeah  You guys are the very first guys  That never asked me that question  Really?  I never got into that  Well you'll be asked tomorrow  It's where ridiculous  Because what happened was  And you know when I left  These two lieutenants  Who threw me like this  Kind of like a little party  They got fired  Which was really sad  Oh jeez 
[01:22:30]  Right after I left  Because of what they were doing  No because one guy  Came in  He was taking  One guy who was  Supposedly  He was a CEO  And he was kind of  Taking pictures of all of us  You know eating pizza  And partying  And it was the night  Before I left  And that was really  The saddest part of those  You had a pizza party  Yeah I had a pizza party  Before I left  That's right  I ate pizza  That's right  What do you expect  Rick James  What do you expect  I'm supposed to be in there  I'm just thinking prison Rick  And I'm thinking you know  Prison is prison man  And if you got  You know if you got  What you got  You get what you get 
[01:23:00]  I know it from Oz  I'm thinking Rick James  In the weight room  Looking for someone  I keep telling you  That's kidding  Here comes the Aryan Nation  Look out  They're trying to  Shank Rick James  Dive in front  Dive  You know I had one fight  Man  You did  In CIC  It wasn't in Falsam  Against some  Russian type Aryan dude  You choked him  With your mule  No but I  You know what I did  I whooped his ass  You did  In the bathroom  Yeah I did  Yeah  He suckered me  About something  Me and him  Were having it out  And that was dormitory living  And he would give me  A sucker  And I stood up 
[01:23:30]  For myself man  I'm not punk  Like I said  If I would have  Went in there  Acting like a punk  I would have  You know  They would have  They would have  Taken for your side  Yeah  Well there you go  Rick James in prison  Rick was banging in jail  I also want to ask you  About Linda Blair  Linda Blair  I mean that was  Something that  Came out of nowhere  It was like  All of a sudden  Rick James and Linda Blair  We really going there today  We are really  Touching this up  I gotta be honest  With you  I've been fascinated  What about Linda Blair  I'm fascinated with your life  I'm fascinated with  How did you hook up 
[01:24:00]  With Linda Blair  Today Rick  How did you hook up  With her  All right  Me and Linda met  There was a magazine  Called Wee Magazine  Remember that  I remember that  Oh yeah  Okay  Wee  That was good spanking  Good jacket material  Yes it was  Yeah  You do a lot of spanking  Man  You gotta  Let me get you  An old lady  At the show tomorrow  Man  Wee was a lot better  Than anything else  At the time  Especially because  They showed the  The roast beef shot  Wee  The roast beef shot  You know what I mean  The chewed hubba-bubba shot  The chewed hubba-bubba  What the  Looks like you chewed up  Some of that big pink bubble gum 
[01:24:30]  And threw it on a barbershop floor  Oh that muff  Right  Oh okay  I like that  That vertical mouth  It was good to get jacked  Into that magazine  I don't think Rick  Has ever jacked in his eyes  No man  Oh please  The guy  You just gotta ring the bell  Oh ladies  Hop the knob please  Rick when did you start  Getting away  Super freak  No but  Back to that Linda Blair  She had done a layout  In Wee Magazine  Now the only thing I knew  About Linda Blair  Was I was scared to death  When I saw Exorcist  Yeah  I'm not gonna lie about it  I'm not gonna sit here  And try to be macho  And I'm sure it did 
[01:25:00]  Everybody who was back  At that time  Yeah  And um  Linda did a layout  And she was like  It was cold blooded  I mean she was like  Bam  Oh those  Chans she had  Oh yeah  Beautiful  Yeah  Layout  And they asked her  And along with it  Like the four or five  Page colored pictures  Of her  Laying by his pool  And all this  And all this other stuff  They asked her  If there was one man  That she had to be with  Who would you want to be with  And she said  Rick James  This is an invitation  For Rick  In a god damn 
[01:25:30]  Wee Magazine  Yeah exactly  Pretty much  But you know what  In the old days  That's how actresses  And actresses got together  Really  They would just say  Something in an interview  They would drop in  How long did it take you  To drop the magazine  And pick up the phone  Well my family came to me  The guy who was working  For me came to me  He said  Look Rick  Read this  And I sent her some roses  And I ended up doing  A wee lay out too  And we met here  Right in New York  With Mark  Over at Mark Feiserman's  Yeah  Hotel  And we met  And um  Hit it off  Yeah we became really close 
[01:26:00]  Wow  That's  And then what  What happened  With the relationship  Because you guys  Were together for how long  We were together  For off and on  For a few years  We're still very close  Are you?  Yeah  That's cool  What happened to the  Was it something that  Did the drugs play a part  Or  Uh yeah  I was  Yeah she was trying to stop  I mean she had  Virtually pretty much stopped  I mean she was still  Drinking a little but  It's kind of hard  To hang out with a guy  Who's  Out of control  Well no  I mean she  Did she give you  Any of that exorcist talk  That F me 
[01:26:30]  F me  You mean  Did she roll her head around  And something like that  Screaming the  F me  F me  No  Y'all gotta get Linda in here  See I won't talk  No no  I can't  You guys will get her in here  I'd love to have her in here  She's a very pretty girl  Well you're sure  She's a very very sweet person  Without any detail  I'm not gonna ask you to  You know  Tell tales like that  I'm not gonna get her in here  But there had to be some point  Especially the first time  You did get intimate  Where you're like  Screwing the exorcist chick  It's like I'm gonna 
[01:27:00]  Holy Jesus  No no no no  No  No no no no no  See you with your ego  You're probably like  She's probably thinking  I'm screwing Rick James  That's cool  That's cool man  I'm not even gonna touch it man  Yeah  I'm not even going  I'm not going there  I hear you  She'll hear about it  She'll never speak  Grabbing some gravy  Or whatever  Mule  Yeah I hear you  It's a Fifi  That's good  A Fifi 
[01:27:30]  A Fifi  A Fifi  Yeah  The prison vag  Is called a Fifi  Oh a Fifi  The homemade vag  The homemade thing  Nah  What  They called it a Fifi  They called it a Fifi  In the joint  Some guys can't just  Ring up the guards  And bang them  In another room  They gotta make a Fifi  Well you know  Hey everybody  Ain't RJ  You know what I'm saying  I hear you  I get the stuff  That's for sure  What you think  I'm gonna go in there  And let George  Or Bubba  Drill me  Like I said  My only knowledge 
[01:28:00]  Of prison is Oz  And that's all  I wanna hear  I never wanna get  Any closer to prison  Than my television set  And sometimes  That's too much  When they're showing  The guys doing each other  Who needs that  You know what  I never saw  A whole Oz  No  Never saw a whole Oz  I see little bits and pieces  Every time I see that  I kinda laugh  Because it's always  Over dramatized  Yeah  I mean it's not really  Like well  Where I was  I mean you have your sex  You have your Aryan race  And you have your Mexican mom 
[01:28:30]  And you have your  That's enough for me  To not wanna go  And everybody does  Sit in their parts  You know  In the kitchen  Or whatever  But uh  You know  And sometimes  Fights break out  And people get shot  But I mean  Yeah whatever  You know  It's not  It's prison dramatic  Because uh  God damn  You know  Yeah it sounds  You know something  It's Scared Straight  For me  Remember that show  Scared Straight  Where they scared the kids  By taking them into prison  Matter of fact  Don't they have a woman  On there  Who's like  Who takes stuff  From Jews  Like whatever she wants  Or something  And she's kinda like 
[01:29:00]  I'm taking you  Oh one of the guards  Yeah  She comes up  And just  Much like Rick  And then the guys  Refuse sometimes  Yeah well  She's a heifer pig  Who cares  When you do her 25 years  You don't care  If she looks like Prince  You don't  That's right  Can I ask  The question  That everybody's been  Afraid to ask Rick  What  Did you or Eddie Murphy  Write Party all the time  No  I wrote Party all the time  Yeah did  Poor Eddie  You wrote that

[01:31:00]  Bring the mood down at all  But I do have to ask you  Is it true you had a stroke  In late 98  Yeah I did  About two and a half years ago  I did  In Denver  Yeah  Wow it must have been minor  Thank God  No no no  No  No it was  I broke two blood vessels  In the back of my neck  Cerebellum and medulla  I was in the hospital  Seven months  Wow  Damn  I wasn't able to walk  I wasn't able to see straight  I wasn't able to write  And I did five months of rehab  It was a very humbling experience 
[01:31:30]  I must say you know  Wow  And I can't say where it was from  The doctor said I moved  I moved my neck  Maybe  I moved my head too much  Don't say that  I'm not even going to move now  See  No one's going to be  Making everyone scared  Yeah because we all wake up  In the morning  And kind of  You prick the neck a little bit  And you can't move all day  Now I'm going to worry  I'm going to have a stroke  But you know  It was very hot  At this place  And you know  Denver is pretty high up 
[01:32:00]  Oh it was in Denver  Yeah  It was in Denver  But yeah I did  And it was like  It took me five months  You know just to be able  To catch the ball  Or just to be able  To write my name  Wow  Rick walk us through it though  You wake up in the morning  And all of a sudden  You know something's wrong  I mean  No I went off stage man  I went off stage  And I felt fine  And I went back to the hotel  And a guy who works for me  Named Tom  I asked him  You know  I asked him to rub  You know  My neck started  I said would you like  Trying to get that out  And then he touched it  I just didn't even want  To be touched 
[01:32:30]  So I went to the window  And it just seemed like  I had drank  I mean I never had  But it seemed like  I had drank  Forty bottles of bourbon  So the whole room  Just went  Top you know  And there was  No  Yeah  And then  I went to the hospital  And I walked out of the hospital  And the next morning  I like couldn't  Why they misdiagnosed it  Yeah they sure did  What did they say  You pinched a nerve  No  They said I had  If you believe this  I laid in that  I laid in that hospital room 
[01:33:00]  For about five hours  They said I had gastritis  Gas  Jesus man  Something very close  Right  And they gave me  This bottle of stuff  To take  And I walked out  And I walked back  To the hotel room  And I was fine  I mean  I took the car  Back to the hotel  Then the next morning  I like  The right side of me  Crater's  And I like  It was just  Weird  And  When my old lady  Picked me up  In LA  She said she didn't  Reckon  I was in a wheelchair  And  I couldn't focus 
[01:33:30]  The whole room  Was still moving  All around  And  She wanted me  To go to the hospital  Then  But I said  Well I'll wait  Till the morning  Till the morning  It was the same thing  They took me  And the doctor  Really  She brought me  Right in the nick of time  It was  It was a bad scene  I didn't ever think  You know  That was  Did you do anything  About the first  Doctors you saw  You know  I really felt like  Suing them  And going through  All of that  But  I don't know  What  A friend of mine  Told me  Even if I did 
[01:34:00]  It would only be  So much money  There's a law in Denver  Yeah because  They really  I mean  They really didn't  Give me the EKGs  And they didn't  Maybe if they got  A little earlier  It would have been  So long  I'm going to tell you  You know  The honest thing  About it was  The way I felt  The way they  Threw me on a gurney  Was like  Here's this drug  Rock musician  And it was  A drug thing  And here's this cat  And the hell with me  The way they took me around  Wow  You know  I felt really  Almost racist overtones

[01:36:30]  Hey we got a  We put together a fact sheet  You know we all got together  And then tried to figure out  What we want to talk about here  Is it true your mother ran numbers  For the Italian mob  Yes she did  She ran numbers for the gangsters  And she fed eight  She raised eight children by herself  From it  From running numbers  From running numbers  And I'm proud to say  She also played numbers too  I am  What you know that is  You go to sleep  You dream  And you wake up  And you play a number  And you hit  Well she did that too  And she hit off all of us  And all  She made a very very lucrative 
[01:37:00]  Sent my brother to Georgetown University  Top law school  Sent my sister to the  Top county school for CPA  She did very well  Yes she did run numbers  I'm proud to say it  Numbers runner  Nice  Yeah my family did that too  But I'm Italian  So it was the law  No we had to pay y'all  That's it  Hey John you're next  With Rick James  What's up  Hey how are you doing Mr. James  I was wondering  What do you think about  M.C. Hiram  Make all that money 
[01:37:30]  With his son  Well number one  He didn't make  As much money as you think  When someone does a song of mine  They have to make a deal  With my administrator  M.C. Hiram  Did about an 80-20 deal  Where he made his money was  When he was touring  I make the majority of the money  When they do a sample deal  Okay  But what he did wrong  Was buying helicopters and guns  For the Oakland police  And horses for 500,000  Man that guy knew how to spend his money 
[01:38:00]  He was a total fool  And really the thing  I'm really pissed off about  I'm not  No he paid  No I got paid very well off that  And  But the thing I'm really mad about  He never ever really once said  One time  That you know  It was a Rick James song  He never  Because he won awards  For that song right  No we won  No we both  No we won a Grammy together  Because he put himself in  As one of the writers  And he  But he never said  You know  He said  I read one magazine  He said  I took a Rick James guitar lick  What? 
[01:38:30]  You know  But yes  He paid very very well  And he got very very broke  I say  Another great behind the music  Was him  Now he's a preacher  Buying that god damn mansion  That he bought  And  Now he's a preacher  And brought the Oakland police  Guns  And help  Yeah  Hey here's something  You're going to kill some more blacks  Oh wow  We know you need help  I know you need help  So  You can't touch this  Go kill some more of the blacks  In Oakland  Here's some  Helicopters and guns 
[01:39:00]  That I made off  A Rick James record  Go kill  Holy  Seems like you're holding  A grudge there  Well you know  Hey God bless him  Like I said  He's  You know  He's preaching now  They all go to God  When they get broke  Even in prison  Everybody gets very religious  Yeah  They all become Muslims  And Christians  And when they get out  You son of a  You probably  You know  Got a little more spiritual  But you didn't go  The whole route  Right  Well you know  I was born Catholic 
[01:39:30]  So I got  Messed up  My head was messed up  From the jump  You know  Now I mean no  Bistbuckle spirit  So I was at all the point  Right right  I'm a true spiritualist  You know  I truly believe in God  And I try to  I try to stay taqwa  You know  God conscious  Everything I do  You know  And I just try to be  A good person man  I think everybody was expecting  After your hardships  For you to come out  And have the collar on  And just start preaching  The words of Jesus  Hey  Hey yo  No  No  No 
[01:40:00]  No  If anything  I'm just preaching  For people man  To have fun man  And just do each other better  Man  Love each other  That's what it is  See  A lot of the Rick James songs  Are just all purely about effing  Which I think was great  No  You know  That is totally wrong  Yes  Come on  No  That is totally wrong  Man  I've written songs about  MXRs  ICVMs  And missiles  I've written songs about  Dropping nuclear  Everyone knew  You know what that missile was  A big slong  Rick  I've written songs about  Mary Jane  I mean 
[01:40:30]  Mary Jane slang for that  Every song  I know where you're coming from  In other words  What you're saying is  Every song I've ever written  Has to do with  Poongang  Right  Poongang  You are so sick  And I thought I was really doing  Writing some politically  You know  People that want to just  Scratch the surface  Might see that  But you look deep like me  You realize everything's about  Effing  And his hog  Right  That MX missile  That's your mule man 
[01:41:00]  Is it  You're going to go crash  Into some vads  Even the Mary Jane girls  Right  Now my house  Okay  Yeah  That was  I wrote a song  My house  My house  That's a vagina  The house of your missile  Which is  Yeah  No that's  My house is a vagina  Right  And the key that unlocks the door  That is the  Pannery  That's lubricant  Exactly  Alright  So you know  In that case  Yes  Where are you coming from  Exactly  Because her lover wasn't home  Probably someone like you  Whacking the hoop  Bitsing the meats  And pulling the grog 
[01:41:30]  Yeah  Jack  At the fee fee  Yeah  This is a lot of fun  Rick  I got to tell you  Let's go to  John  John  What's up  Hey John  My name's Mark  What's up Mark  Rick James Geronimo  Mr. James  You and I had met  At a party one time  Do you recognize my voice  No I guess not  Oh yeah  It's deep  I know that  At a party  Were you tied up in a closet  Being burnt with a crack pie  No it was never like that  It wasn't like that  Everybody's got a misconception 
[01:42:00]  About bass and crack  Believe me  Tell them Geronimo  You know what  It's so hysterical  I got to bring this up again  The freebase people  Just look down on the crackheads  Because crack is garbage  And freebase is real cocaine  I didn't spend a million dollars  On that crap for nothing  Tell them Geronimo  We learned something  In our addiction  Didn't we  The thing is  It's like driving  Into a brick wall  At a hundred miles an hour  With a Rambler  Or a Lexus 
[01:42:30]  You're still dead  Crack is the  No hey  But no  A little more style  On the way into the wall  Crack is the poor man's freebase  Yeah  Okay  Mr. James  Yes sir  You came out great  I mean  Out of prison  And everything like that  But when we  Partied together  It was years ago man  Many years ago  The drug situation  Everybody thinks  When you take that one puff  That's how high  You're going to get  That's untrue  It's all in reference  To the person doing it 
[01:43:00]  And I'm not  Saying people should do it  Or shouldn't do it  It's up to them  That's true  In reference to torturing  It's man  A girl who gets tortured  After doing crack  She must be bugging  Her brains out  There's no such thing  But you're a great guy  And they just twisted  Things around  I knew it wasn't true  About you  Thank you very much  I just hope that  Thank you man  Yeah I'm cool too  But uh  Hey Florentine  Where'd you party  With Rick James  What'd you say to me  Where'd you party  With Rick James  What was the first word  What'd you call me  Florentine 
[01:43:30]  Florentine  You sound like a  Like a guy  Yeah that we know  My name is not Florentine  No  My name is Geronimo  From Westchester  Alright  Thanks bro  And he's not going to  Tell you where we party  Together  What do you think  He's going to tell you  Chris has a question  From Rick James  Chris  Hey what's up Rick  How's it going man  What's up Chris  I have two questions  First question is  Is it true that you  Give it to Aretha Franklin  In the back door  What  Is that a rumor  Is that actually a rumor  You know what  Didn't I tell you  This boy was gay  When I  When he got all  Didn't I tell you  He was going to  Give me some kind of 
[01:44:00]  Listen  Listen to me  What is this back door  Stuff with you  Okay  What kind of fetish  Do you have  With this back door  Be proud  Listen  Be proud of your  Homosexuality  Okay  No I mean that  Be proud of it  Okay  Whatever you are  Whatever you are  Be proud  Stand strong  Come out of the closet  Wave your freak flag  Hi boy  But don't call me up  Asking about Aretha Franklin  In the back door  Next question  Give me somebody  Give me somebody  With some pride  Wait wait wait  Rick  Relish your gayness  He's talking about  The balloon nut 
[01:44:30]  And dude  She still walks  So obviously  He didn't give it to her  I would love  You know what  I would love him  To get with Aretha  And ask that  Yeah she'll kick his ass  Right  Have his ass rolling  All over here  Did you show Aretha  Some respect  Alright what's the next question  What's the next question  Alright  I don't know if he's  Having fun anymore  Well you said he had two  Yes he did  I'd blow him off for you  Oh well  Yeah  Oh Joe's been waiting  An hour to talk to you  Joe  Joe what's going on bro  Hey what's up man  Hey Rick man  You like  You one of the  My biggest idols  Growing up  But are you completely 
[01:45:00]  Clean now  As far as I mean  I drink a little wine  Every now and then  How about some weed  What are you offering  You got some marriage aid  You got some good marriage  We Mongo outside now  You got some good marriage aid  You gonna have out in the front for me  Well hey  We got a stairwell Rick  That was like  We take it out to the stairwell  How do you feel about  All these new rappers  Like taking your gimmick  And getting on  Casey Kasem Countdown  I never heard you on that  I've been on Casey Kasem Countdown before  Well now it's like  Every other song 
[01:45:30]  Is like  Like a rap song  You ever heard them  I'm gonna go smoke some free bass  With Rick James  Hi I'm Casey Kasem  No I don't really know  What's going on with Casey  I mean you know  The things have changed man  In 20 years  You know right now  Rap and hip hop is happening  And  What do you think of  It's all good  What do you think of today's music  It depends on what  Today's music we're talking about  Who you like  And who you  Come on Rick  You know it's all whack  My man  Welcome back to the countdown  After watching his best buddy  Notorious B.I.G. 
[01:46:00]  Get smoked and assassinated  P. Diddy  Continued and forged on  With his bad boy family  Exactly  So here's  P. Diddy and Rob  Black Rob  In at number 10  Come on man  You're a real master  You know  Okay well let me just put it  Let me just put it like this  There's some rap out there  That is positive  But when rappers get out there  It needs to be word  And the n-word  And when they talk about  Shooting each other  And they talk about AKs  That I completely frown down on  Okay  Totally 
[01:46:30]  So I mean  There's probably more  Negative rap out there  Than there is positive  See what they'd say  We're just keeping it real  Yeah well they can say  What the hell they want to say  They're taking it from the streets  What they grow up with  Yeah well you know what  And then putting it on  You know what  Most people that say the n-word  Has no idea what it means  Because it has nothing to do with  Black or ignorant  Or anything  They have no idea what it means  A nigger means foul fish  In Swahili  In a world translation book  It means foul fish  It has nothing to do with  We used to call ourselves that  Out of an endearment thing  White people took it as a derogative thing 
[01:47:00]  Number one  So they don't know what the hell they're saying  Number two  Every woman to me is not a bitch  My mother is a one  My sister is a one  My lady is a one  And I hate to hear that word  That one that says  You're kidnapped  There's one  You could call her  She's the only bitch I know  Call her a C-word  That one  That's the only bitch I know  But the bottom line is  Is that black music  Is where it is  Is basically one reason  Is because the government  Has taken musical instruments  And stuff out of schools  So these kids  Don't really have a way to go 
[01:47:30]  So what do they do  They sample  And they do the best that they can  I wish that lyrically  They would  Start singing about mules again  Take it to another level  But hey  They'd argue with you  That like  You know Rick  Maybe you're just not in touch  With what's going on  These things  You know what  There's nothing more going on  Than what it was before  There's still a ghetto  There's still poverty  There's still drug addiction  There's still racism  You know it's the same thing man  Ain't nothing changed  Ghetto life is the same  Okay  Now it ain't Mary Jane 
[01:48:00]  Now it's in no and chronic  Now we don't pull our pants up  Now they're sagging  You know  I mean what the hell  I mean there's no difference man  There's no difference  It's all  You know  Now there's Michael Jordan  Okay  And now  Instead of Temptations  You've got NSYNC  I think there's a far cry  Between them  Yeah I mean you know  White music  And Latino  Thank God too  Because Latino  I mean I'm glad to see  So many Latins  Finally making it  But I mean  White people  Have basically 
[01:48:30]  Taken over R&B  I mean R&B  On the back here  Just that wimpy stuff  Like NSYNC  NSYNC  And Blackstreet  And Britney Spears  Rick no one's listening to that  People do  That's selling millions of records man  You know  To 12 and 13 year olds maybe  Well you know  But we were 12 and 13 year olds  At one time  And you were having sex right  I was having sex  When I was 9 years old  Man I was knocking it out  You know  9 years old  Wait slow down  We've got to hear the story  9  You didn't lose it at 9 
[01:49:00]  Yeah I did  Holy jeez  To who?  A girlfriend of my sister  I wrote a song about  Godhead Life  You know what's interesting too  His age matched  How many inches  He was packing at the time  Which is so disturbing  For me as a white guy  You know what  It's funny  Because a lot of guys  A lot of guys  Talk about their first time  They act like they're Don Juan  The first time I ever had sex  I put it in every orifice I could  I didn't know what hole to put in  And then when I thought  His big climax was coming  I leaped up out  And ran to the corner of the basement 
[01:49:30]  And thought I was going to the bathroom  Nothing came out  So I went back in  And that is the living truth  God damn it  That's funny  That's true man  Look I don't know what they dumped out of  We will replay that  You didn't know  Well he didn't know  The sensation that was coming up  Was him getting ready to finish  Well it's not  So he like got out of the bed  Ran away into the corner  It wasn't a bed  It was a human being man  There you go  There you go again  There you go again 
[01:50:00]  I was just trying to clean it up a little bit  Go with that muffin and move again  The fee fee  The fee fee  The fee fee  So he thought he had to do  Go to the bathroom  No she was a friend of my sister's  And it was really  How old was she?  She was 14  And she was a friend of my older sister  And it happened in the projects in Buffalo  And you know  Fruit Street  Maybe that's why I've always had a thing for older women  I don't know  Yeah  Yeah  Muffin the move  Muffin the move  Slappin the  Jacket  Jacket  And Mr. Meoff  Rick James is playing BB King Blues Club

[02:16:30]  He wasn't being one of those people that don't talk  I hate when people come on a talk show and refuse to talk  You know  Stick around Linda  There's like a 30 second piece that didn't make the radio  I must have been completely dumped out of the show  Rick  I don't know what was going on in his head but he lost his effing mind  I think you know what happened  He said the F word once  And we didn't dump out here  Right  Because we know they were dumping out down the hall  We want to save this dump  We figured Ned Flanders would get it 
[02:17:00]  Right  Ned Flanders down the hall would get it  So we have our dump button here  But we were saving this dump for a little later  Because we kind of knew he might curse  And when we didn't react to the first one  He just assumed you could say the F and S word on the air  And kind of spoke accordingly  There was a few combos  Yeah  Impressive combos  The F's and S's  And I think New York might have gotten his treat  He did a  Today  He did an F-S combo that was  Yeah 
[02:17:30]  Very good  Very good  All right Linda thank you  Thanks  All right  Bye  It's not like this is satellite radio  Where you can say whatever you want  And never lose the signal  Ha ha  Are they done with the commercial?  Then  Find out where they're at  We have a new client  I guess we can start setting it up  I don't even know where the spot is  Yeah my acting is so bad  You know what  That's not what  That's not what we were going for though  We thought it would be funny to hear two guys doing the same read  Right  I want to hear  We got to hear the original first 
[02:18:00]  Why don't we set it up  Because I think they're just about  Almost ready?  Yes  We have a new sponsor to the show  A lot of our sponsors you may have noticed on this show  It's not like we used for example  Before Rush Limbaugh  His syndicated radio program  Has sponsors with such names as Chevrolet  You might have heard of that  Ford  Things like that  Huge restaurant chains  Stock brokers  Things of that nature  The Opie and Anthony show 
[02:18:30]  What do we have?  We love our sponsors too  Don't get us wrong  We have F potions  We have F potions  Little elixirs that help you F  And more F potions  F potions  More F potions  And  Dr. Philidoff  And  Stuff that keeps you awake all night  Right  So you can have some more  So you can have F potions  Makes you F more  If you take the F potion  Right  Things like that  Some of the things keep you awake all night  And you can F with them  Jim what the hell?

The yelling outside the studio  That probably you guys didn't hear  You know the funniest thing is  We're sitting there  Because you're waiting for it to happen  And there was kind of a long delay  From the time she said okay  Till the time it happened  So I'm listening real close  Because maybe I'm going to hear something  That's barely audible

[02:27:00]  Tomorrow night and Saturday  West 42nd between 7th and 8th  You know what?  We just did a great interview with Rick James  Ah, he was great  Came in here with his olive oil charm  What was that?  What was the line?  His olive oil skin and his guinea charm  And his guinea charm  And she ran off just to make me look ridiculous  A man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous  And the topic of Eddie Murphy came up 
[02:27:30]  Yeah  Because Rick James wrote Party All the Time  And we were like, this is Party All the Time  Big hit, though  Oh, I know, huge hit  You see the video?  I'm sure Eddie Murphy wants that buried  So, it's ridiculous  It's ridiculous  So I think Rick James was feeling very comfortable with us, Anthony  Yeah  And he pretty much went off  So he didn't hear this during the interview  Because we had to dump out of most of it  Most of it got dumped out of him 
[02:28:00]  Yeah  So check it out, Rick James  I know you guys  Eddie was already a multi-millionaire  Yeah  He wasn't doing any interviews  He didn't want to talk to you guys  You guys were always trying to get him  He was going to talk to you  Yeah, he was saying to hell with you  And y'all didn't want to play that record  But people kept calling up  You know, those little old women who live out there  Who don't seem to f*** with y'all  I mean  Obviously, y'all don't have the same thing going on  Because y'all think what the f*** y'all want to say  And you get away with  No, no, y'all do 
[02:28:30]  Y'all get away with  Okay  Anybody else  No one else can get away with  The f*** y'all get away with  Can't  Nobody in the f*** world can get away with  The f*** y'all get away with  Wait a minute, Rick  Now you're going to believe me  Hold it, Rick  We're out of dump now  We have ran out of delay  That's hilarious  Yeah  We ran out of delay  Yeah, Rick took up all the delay  With his f***ing and s***ing  We've got to make a promo out of that  What a great guy he is  That looks fun  Alright, on to the next thing 
[02:29:00]  It's a potpourri of things happening here  Potpourri  Potpourri  Dream cream  Swear to God  There's a brand new sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show  And we played the commercial earlier for free  So they don't bitch and complain  This is all for free  For dream cream  So we want to play the actual commercial  And then we had Steve from FoundryMusic.com  And Jim Norton go into the studio  And record the exact same spot as a gay couple  Because the acting I don't think is really up to par on the real spot

[02:35:30]  Yeah  One person tomorrow that brings down something really, really crazy will win a trip to WrestleMania  Does that say it all?  Yeah, that says it all  All right  So let's bring her in  She's got nice bags  Yeah  She's got nice boots  Yeah, she's sexy  Hey, how you doing?  Hi  Wow, you're going to lick stuff off of the toilet bowl?  That makes it even hotter  What's up, Norton? 
[02:36:00]  His hand's in his pocket and he's working it  Take that as a compliment  You know, most people would be offended by a guy looking at you, shoving his hand in his pocket and fooling with his mule  It's a compliment  It's just like if he would have said to you, wow, you look lovely  Yes  That's his way of saying it  That's my way of saying, what did you do to your hair?  Yeah, exactly  Does your boyfriend allow you to wow?  Mm-hmm  Oh!  Can we see?  Can I say hi to him?  Yeah  Hi, Ian  Yes 
[02:36:30]  And how old are you?  23  Whoa, wow, there you go, that's deceiving  That's why we call it wow, one has a little door knocker  That's a little deceiving, I thought they were going to be smaller than that  Really?  Based on what she's wearing  Nice  Yeah  Oh yeah, Steve C needs it for foundrymusic.com  Oh, well, that won't make it on the radio  Boy, how about that, we can't even say that on the air  My bad  That's okay  It says T-T  Yeah, T-T  Yeah 
[02:37:00]  Alright, how long are you dating this guy?  Five and a half years  Wow  Yeah  How about that?  He's a good kid  Yeah?  He's a good kid  Alright, so you want to do this for the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Yep, let's do it  Wow, have you ever licked anything from a toilet bowl before?  We usually ask like, have you ever done, and then whatever they're going to do  We've been nervous  Like the lamb brain thing, I said have you ever eaten lamb brains before to the girl  But, yeah, that's kind of silly even asking  We've been preparing the toilet bowl today 
[02:37:30]  Oh, really?  I haven't flushed once during a week  We had, did Pete  We had a crunch marathon today  Did Pete have his morning dump today?  Yes, he did  I was, I moved my bowels at approximately 11.30  And I left it sitting there  Until it broke apart and looked like just oatmeal  Oh, God, dude  Alright, where's Ricky?  I guess he's got the microphone  I think I can do this 
[02:38:00]  Ricky, you ready?  You ready for this?  Come on, he's sexy  Alright, we're filming it from foundrymusic.com  Can we get some stills, too?  We'll try and get some stills  We'll get them here in this way  Because, you know what?  People bitch about our show  They say, you know  I don't have the good system  I would rather just see stills of some of the things you guys do  It's tough to, you know, download all the video  What the hell year is this?  That's what they tell me, Ed  Back in the older days  It used to take a long time to download  And it used to  The quality sucked  Nowadays, it doesn't take much of a system 
[02:38:30]  To view quality video on the internet  Why don't you just send in envelopes  And we'll mail you still photos  Don't say that  You want still photos?  Not to you, because you won't open them  If you want still photos  Go to a crappy site like eatabullet.com  So what's that got to do?  I don't like that jabs at April 18th at Town Hall  I don't want to hear any of those stuff  I don't like it  When is that show going to sell out?  It's a big venue  Yes, it is  Yes, it is  Come on, people  Help us out 
[02:39:00]  Just buy the goddamn tickets  Yeah  That means more fun radio for you  Shut Norton up  Buy tickets  That's right  There you go  That's what your commercial should be  I really am worthless  Alright, let's go into the  Through the magic of radio  We're going into the  No crunch zone  How dangerous is this?  She wants Norton to hold her hair back  So it doesn't go in the toilet  How tempted is he going to be  To shove her face in the water  Until she's dead?  I heard a scream already  Yeah  What's the problem?  She probably didn't like the  Look of the toilet 
[02:39:30]  And the bathroom  It's disgusting  And no joke  We haven't flushed it in hours  Yeah  Why does it sound like the weather broadcast channel  From a hurricane?  Because they're moving the mic around  Rick?  Yo  Alright  Alright, I'm going to cover the toilet now  With what?  Oh, with the chocolate  Hey, Rick  Yeah  Yeah, it's got to be a ring  What are we thinking here, Ann?  An inch above water?  Yeah, as close to the water line as you can get  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do  Where her time might actually have to go into the water 
[02:40:00]  I already left a drop in here  And it just looks vile  Oh, good  Yes, just smear it  And how long?  Should it go around the whole bowl?  I'm doing the whole bowl  Yeah, okay  Then she's going to have to do one lap around the bowl  One lap and lap  One or three  What?  One lap around the bowl, right?  Yeah, one good ring of chocolate  Alright, I'm covering 
[02:40:30]  I've got at least  I've got at least an inch thick  I've got to see this  Ring around the bowl  Tell, I mean, take a look, Opie  And then when you're done, come back here  Entertain the crowd  And I will go and take a look  Because I've got to see this  Toilet bowls are friggin' disgusting  And it doesn't matter how much you clean them  It doesn't matter that you're flushed  I can't imagine the bacteria  Anthony? 
[02:41:00]  Yes  I can barely hear you  But I'm looking at the toilet  This is really, really rank  Everyone knows this is probably like the bathroom you'd see at a crack house  I was thinking more bathroom you'd see at like Penn Station  Yeah, okay  A bathroom and a train station, right  It has kind of a Silent Hill look to it  If you've ever played Silent Hill  It's dirty  And you can never imagine it being clean  This, it looks like the guy that might have used the bowl had a real problem 
[02:41:30]  You know when you open up the stall in a bathroom, say at Grand Central Station  Or someplace like that  And you get surprised when you look in  Yeah  And you see that log that's been there  And it completely broke apart  So the water just has a color to it  That's what we're looking at  You're making me sick, dude  You want to check it out?  Yes, definitely  Alright, hold on  I'll be making his way back  I want to see what this looks like 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  And when you come in here  You're going to see that the  Now the water on top  It's got like an oil base to it  Oh really?  It's like an oil slick?  Whatever residue was on the sides of the bowl  Yeah  Has now melded with the chocolate  And there's some kind of chemical reaction going on  You know what happens too?  The water will leach up the chocolate  I'm back in the studio  It's disgusting  Go check it out  Let me look  Let me take a look  Ann, just stay there for the bit  Ann, Ann, Ann  Yeah  I got to give you a little  Little  No, look  No, I can't say it  Oh, okay 
[02:42:30]  When  She's doing  All right  I got you  Alright  There goes Ann to go  I'll wait a little while  Yeah, I understand  All right  We're filming this for foundrymusic.com  Let's take a look-see  Ann's in the no crunch zone  Oh, that's  Wow  Yeah  That does look like the bathroom  That you see at a train station  Yeah  The one you just open the stall and go  Oh my God  Slam it  Right  Hmm  All right  Well, I can't hear Opie either  Huh? 
[02:43:00]  No headphones  No, you can hear  Oh, there you go  I wasn't saying anything  A little monitor in here  I wasn't saying anything  Oh, okay  Well, that's why I thought I couldn't hear you  I don't know what to say when you're not in the studio  Are you  Are you ready, Steph?  I feel like I should be playing records  Let's just do this  She's getting a little  Aren't you getting a little  You're getting a little leery of this now, right?  Yeah, but I can handle it  You can handle it, though?  All right  Hey, Ann, what's the  Norton's going to hold your hair  And your head under the water  And we're going for one lick around the whole bowl, right? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, hold on  Yes, Opie, yes  We're going for one lick all the way around?  One lick around the complete circumference of said turlet  And she'll be in  That's okay, take your time  She'll be in the 55-gallon drum challenge  All right, Ann, we're ready over here  Okay, and Steph, if you would  Start licking the inside of that toilet bowl  Norton's holding her hair back, Opie  Okay  She's in the toilet  All right  Oh, my  Oh, no  No, that ain't helping  That ain't working  Her hair is getting in the chocolate 
[02:44:00]  And in the water  She can't get to the  Opie  Yeah  She cannot get to the back part of the toilet  You know the part that really gets stained  When you blast an ice one out  Uh-oh  Is she gagging?  Are you okay?  You okay?  Her head slipped  Your head slipped  And your face went right in the toilet water, didn't it?  The chocolate  How is it, Steph?  What does it taste like?  Chocolate syrup  And toilet?  You got chocolate on my hand  This is disgusting  You got toilet on my chocolate  You can't get back there? 
[02:44:30]  You can't bend your head?  What if we hold you up by your legs?  Go ahead  Ann  Hey, she's got a tat on her ass  How about if she takes her finger?  It's a jap  What is that?  Jap writing on your butt crack?  You know what that says in Japanese?  Toilet liquor  I'm teasing, of course  Hey, Ann  Yes  Have her take her finger  And get the back side of the ball  Oh, you could scoop some with your finger  Opie, what a great idea  Why didn't we think of that?  There she goes  She's taking her finger  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:45:00]  Oh, she just did it  Now get your face in there  And get that part  See the back?  Oh my God, Opie  That was the sickest idea  But it worked  And is it time?  Yeah  Okay  Alright, here we go  He just scared her  Rick flushed the toilet  Alright, Steph  I gotta say  You've accomplished your mission  You qualify  And you will be one of the contestants  For the 55-gallon drum challenge tomorrow 
[02:45:30]  And if you think this was bad  Wait till tomorrow  We torture you worse than Rick James did  Allegedly  And Rick might even be here for it  Alright  Bravo  Thank you so much  I'm gonna stay in there for a second  Thanks for the paper  Oh, man, that was an even bright  There was something really sexy  About a girl putting her head in the toilet  Yeah  Really sexy  She started licking  The front side of the toilet 
[02:46:00]  You know, the side closest to you  When you're standing  And taking a leak  Yeah  And she slipped  And her face went right into the chocolate  Water  And then she's trying so hard  Bending her head  And twisting her neck  And contorting herself  To get the chocolate  On the back part of the toilet  That part that really gets bombed  When you're hung over  And have been drinking cheap beer all night  Did it look like she  Completed a rusty trombone in?  Yes  When she popped her head back out?  In the worst way 
[02:46:30]  On a cancer patient  Yeah, and then when you came up with the idea  That she used her finger  She went around the entire toilet with her finger  And then  Put the chocolate in her mouth  Well, get her back in here  Oh, man  She's pretty hot now  And Norton's packing and working it  All right  Hey, how was that?  I got like a chocolate film in the back of my mouth  Yeah, that film is something from the toilet, I think  That ain't chocolate  Whoa 
[02:47:00]  That ain't chocolate  Yeah  Wow  That's film  That is really commitment to the contest and this program  We're very proud of you  All girls have to do it in their bra and panties tomorrow  You know that, right?  Yeah, I heard that  Okay, that's cool  You wear thongs?  Yes  All right, Jim  You see the barrel?  See one of the barrels?  Yeah, I actually went in the barrel  Oh, you did?  Yeah  How did it?  To see how comfortable  How did it work out?  It was comfortable  A little tight?  I think I can take it  Yeah?  In what position?  Were you crouched?  Yeah  Knees and boots 
[02:47:30]  Knees into the chest  Yeah, just these barrels  Chest  They're not that high  And we do throw the lid on these things  Yeah  You know, that's something else that goes on with these barrels  Some of the girls can't crouch down for that long  For that long  Your feet will fall asleep  You were a catcher?  I was a catcher  Yeah  Well, I'm a pitcher  Put your own joke in wherever you want  Insert jokes  I've been in those relationships  I'm a catcher for 12 years  I got it  You were a catcher on the girls' softball team?  12 years  Yeah  Got it  12 years 
[02:48:00]  You ever have a foul ball come back and hit you in the lip?  Mm-hmm  What?  A foul ball hit you in the lip  No, no, no  Who's talking about softball?  All right, Ant  You know what?  Yeah  We got to shove a few more things down our listeners' throats today  We got a lot of good stuff  Yeah  We got to play What Do We Learn Next?  Wow, look at the time already  And here's the rusty trombone song  We'll be back  A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore 
[02:48:30]  She'll reach around and get you off with her hand  All the while she'll lick your spot  By your tiny balloon nut  Hope you didn't eat too much bread  A rusty trombone may not be moral  While I think this sounds kind of gay 
[02:49:00]  I'd rather get some oral with the finger up my butt  But that's me  What the hell  I'm a nut  Come on, honey  Start the music  Yeah  You play that well  Up next  What did you learn today?  The O.B. and Anthony Show  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show  We got the Queen  We have three stories we didn't even get to 
[02:49:30]  He died today  No  Another guy died on the L.I.E.  A famous heart surgeon  This happens like once or twice a year  It's like unlucky lottery or something  Oh, that is unlucky lottery  And it sucks to be you  It, um  Man, how many times do you drive down a major highway  Every day  For your commute to work  And you see things on the road 
[02:50:00]  You go, oh, what's that?  Oh, let me get around that  Maybe it's a piece of metal or wood or something that fell off a truck  This thing was, uh  You know the tractor trailers?  When they unhook the trailer from the tractor  And they crank down those legs  And on the bottom of the legs are those big metal plates  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  One of those  One of those fell off?  One of those fell off  It was sitting in on the Long Island Expressway  Tell me a car popped that up in the air  A car's driving by  Hits it  Now, you've seen how those things are shaped  They're kind of like the front of skis on the front of it 
[02:50:30]  You know what I mean?  It kind of slopes up a little bit  The car must have hit this thing perfectly  It flies up in the air  And goes right through the windshield of this doctor's car  And through his head  And out the back window  I heard it fell off a truck  Yeah, fell off a truck  This happens, uh  Like I said, once or twice a year  Unlucky lottery  What are the odds of that happening to you?  You know who's even in worse shape?  The guy that was laying there waiting for him to show up 
[02:51:00]  And operate  Oh, yeah, he was a heart doctor  There's some guy who he was probably supposed to see that day  That is now  Oh  Where's your doctor?  All right  That's unlucky lottery  Because the odds  Yeah, I know  And I hold in my hand  Is this the version I want to read?  Yeah, okay  Possibly the worst story ever posted  This is unlucky lottery  Sucks to be you  And the bitches  It's the bitches that'll get you  It's all in one  It's a combo platter? 
[02:51:30]  Combo platter  All three in one  Fort Worth, Texas  It's off the AP  So it has to be true  Right  A prosecutor in Fort Worth, Texas says  Maybe we've just redefined inhumanity  Listen to this  This comes after police arrested  A 25-year-old woman  A nurse's aide  In a man's hit-and-run death  Police told the Fort Worth Star  Telegram that the victim  Was trapped in the broken windshield  Of the car that hit him  For at least two days  Two days  Begging for help 
[02:52:00]  Before he finally died  Of blood loss and shock  Yeah  So I guess the guy's what?  On the side of the road  Walking or whatever  This nurse's aide comes flying by  Hits him  He gets trapped in the windshield  Yeah  She said she was drinking  And using drugs  Using drugs  And she hits the guy  Yeah  And his body  Head first  Head first  Goes through the windshield  So now he's stuck in the windshield  So he's stuck in the windshield  His front half  Is in the car  Through the windshield  His legs  Are on the hood  Of the car  Right  She continues 
[02:52:30]  To drive home  To drive home  With him through the windshield  A police statement says  She panicked  And with the man still  Lodged in the windshield  She drove a few miles  To her home  Parked in her garage  And ignored his police  For help until he died  He's in the garage  Going well  Help me  Hello  His body was later dumped  Yeah  Police say the woman  Told them she occasionally  Went into the garage  Apologizing to the victim  Apologize  Water doodle  Apologize 
[02:53:00]  I'm so sorry  I hit you  While you were walking  Now you're in my windshield  Waddle doodle  I'd offer you a bone dry  This ends with  But I might get in trouble  This ends with  The impact had hurled him  Head first through the windshield  His broken legs  Sticking out onto the hood  So all he had  At the time  Was just broken legs  Waddle doodle  No wonder they drive around  With them stuck in their windshields  Holy ass  What?  He couldn't get out though  He couldn't use his arms 
[02:53:30]  He couldn't  Well the guy was  Hit by a car  And thrown through the windshield  He's got broken legs  Basically he was stuck  I was very injured  It hurt me  I was sticking through the windshield  She did nothing but apologize to me  And I was very injured  I couldn't crawl out  My shoes were on the hood  And my glasses were inside  I couldn't reach them  She should just be shot  She um  Let's see  There's other things too  She uh  You know how they got a line on this woman? 
[02:54:00]  She would  Go out  And start talking about it  To her friends  And co-workers  That's uh  They're saying  They got a line on it  And uh  Some acquaintances  The woman helped remove the body  Put it in the trunk of another car  Dropped to Cobb Park  They dumped it  And uh  Two men found the body  He and uh  There was one other little tidbit  The car seats were removed  And found in her backyard  One of them burned  So she's trying to get rid of 
[02:54:30]  Any evidence  And uh  Here's something  The guy  Was a homeless guy  Poor little homeless guy  Walking around the streets  Doesn't that all of a sudden  Make it that it isn't as bad?  I mean it's a terrible  Terrible thing  Cause it's a human being  It's a human being and all  But for some reason  You know  I'm guilty  Of thinking  It's like  Oh okay  It was a homeless guy  That just took  Every ounce of annoyance  Away from me  If he wasn't sticking 
[02:55:00]  Through the windshield  He would have been  Washing it with a dirty rag  Probably happy for the ride  That's horrible  At least he was  Warming the garage  Not outside in the cold  Mike  And here's the attorneys  Again stepping in  The woman's attorney  Shantae Mallard  Her name was  Guilty  Yeah  Yeah  You know how those  Foul fish are  What?  Wow  What did I say? 
[02:55:30]  That's a callback  I don't think I said anything  Quite frankly  I think I'm stupid  But that's a callback  Well this shyster lawyer  Says the woman's arrest  On murder charges  Was premature  What would you call that?  That's murder  She hit the guy  He's in the windshield  To drive home  And then come out  And apologize  Every so often  That's like  Murder  And cruel  And inhuman treatment  How could he not use  His arms to get out though?  I know  You would think  You would do it 
[02:56:00]  He was probably like  Hey  Whoa  I'm hurt  Real bad  You know  He was probably  Homeless drunk guys  Couldn't move  I don't know  I wasn't there Jim  That's a sick story  But for some reason  He couldn't get out  Let's play  What did we learn  On the Opie and Anthony show  Oh you want to hear  The queef real fast?
