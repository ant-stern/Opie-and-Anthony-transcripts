<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing themselves with self-deprecating humor, referencing past controversies and FCC violations. They recounted a humorous snow day, detailing staff struggles to reach the studio due to a blizzard.  Anthony then graphically described his fall down a marble staircase after yoga, including his ER visit, the loss of his shoes, and the resulting pain, punctuated by numerous off-color, racist, and homophobic jokes.  They then reacted to an American Idol segment featuring a contestant and his brain-injured fiancée, dissecting the performance's emotional manipulation with more crude jokes and commentary.  They promoted upcoming guests: Bobby Lee, Vinny and Uncle Nino from Jersey Shore, Russell Peters, and Brooke Shields, before the segment abruptly ended with Anthony's pained cries as something fell on his injured foot.

The next segment opened with a humorous political ad for Anthony Cumia as a Democrat, followed by a comedic interview with Alan Alda by Jim Norton, which included a joke about Alda having AIDS.  Discussions touched upon the relative fame of celebrities (Alda vs. the Beatles), Obama’s Super Bowl prediction avoidance, the New York mayor's "douche-chilly" Super Bowl bet, and the lack of clear information regarding the Egyptian protests.  They discussed proposed legislation allowing the President to shut down the internet.  Ricky Gervais's *The Office* cameo led to a conversation about comedic boundaries and potentially offensive jokes.  They analyzed China's use of *Top Gun* footage in military propaganda, playing a humorous parody of the soundtrack.  They speculated on Gallagher walking off Marc Maron's podcast, and a caller revealed Obama's alleged 2008 Steelers support. The Super Bowl, James Cameron's *Sanctum*, and base jumping were also discussed, along with Tracy Morgan's offensive joke about Sarah Palin on TNT and the subsequent apology.  The segment concluded with discussions of Charlie Sheen's hospitalization, a walking silverback gorilla, and a call to Sam's mother, Bobby, about promised pies, focusing on pie preferences and baking techniques.

A subsequent segment featured a phone call with Sam's mother, Bobby, who agreed to bake an apple pie.  The hosts discussed pie variations, including a pie made with Sam's hair, and tangents about Martha Stewart and Sam's perceived favored family status.  Comedian Bobby Lee then joined the studio, engaging in discussions about his pornography preferences, detailed descriptions of specific pornographic scenes, drug use and recovery, and anecdotes from *MADtv*, including incidents involving defecation and flatulence.  Upcoming guests Casey Jordan, Vinny and Uncle Nino, Russell Peters, and Brooke Shields were mentioned.  Bobby Lee discussed his Hollywood experiences, recounting a humorous anecdote about a successful comedian who ignored him.

The following segment began with a discussion of New York street scams and a "falcon punch."  Opie recounted a robbery in South Africa where two Black men stole his BlackBerry, expressing reluctance to involve the police.  The conversation included discussion of the N-word, with Opie stating he only used it when not directly addressing Black people.  Audio clips of porn star Casey Jordan recounting a party with Charlie Sheen were played, detailing heavy drinking, cocaine use (including Sheen smoking cocaine through a pipe and blowing it into her mouth), and a large quantity of cocaine delivered by an unknown man. The discussion included graphic descriptions of Casey Jordan's vagina and Charlie Sheen's drug use and sexual exploits.  Vinny from Jersey Shore and Uncle Nino then joined the studio.  Uncle Nino's boisterous personality dominated the conversation, filled with stories about hitchhiking to Florida, acquiring a Ferrari and Harley Davidson, and a seven-month Miami stay fueled by a relationship with Johnny Carson's mistress.  The segment included further discussions of Vinny's life, punctuated by Uncle Nino's interruptions and off-color jokes.

A subsequent segment focused on Vinny from *Jersey Shore*, filled with sexually explicit jokes and boasts about his sexual exploits, fueled by alcohol.  Russell Peters joined as a guest, with Bobby Lee briefly reappearing.  The conversation was filled with unflattering, sexually charged jokes about Vinny, contributed to by guests and hosts, with frequent mentions of "Uncle Nino."

The final segment included a surprise appearance by Brooke Shields. While initially polite, the conversation continued with crude humor, leading to awkward interactions and an inappropriate atmosphere for a celebrity guest. The segment concluded abruptly, with unfinished conversations and promotions for upcoming Russell Peters and Brooke Shields events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit. This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love. That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  Yes, we are live.  Live nationwide.  Actually, live all over the world at this point.  I want to say hi to David in Israel.  He listens every freaking, I want to say morning, 
[00:01:30]  but to him it's probably the middle of Saturday or something.  I don't know.  I can't figure out that crap.  Halfway around the globe.  Friday, January 28th, just to prove we're here live.  Live.  We all kind of took a snow day yesterday.  Yeah, kind of a...  It was a perfect storm to take the day off.  Actually, the only ones that were able to get in here yesterday were me and you.  And, of course, Jimmy.  Everybody else was calling starting at 4.30.  I got a flat tire in Jersey. 
[00:02:00]  My train's not running over here.  My car is in a snow bank over here.  No trains were running, so that kept anybody that takes a train from coming in.  And then how much money does Mars make?  What does he make, $7 an hour or something?  He goes, my bus isn't going to make it in today.  He's the only guy that has to take a bus to this joint.  The bus.  No bus service yesterday.  Yeah, I understand a lot of people have to take buses to go to work,  but I'm telling you, he's the only one at SiriusXM that takes a bus to work, 
[00:02:30]  and it's because he's a Puerto Rican.  Yeah, I think so.  They just like the bus.  It's like, upgrade.  I'm sure you're making okay money.  You got to take a bus every morning?  The bus.  Because my bus isn't running.  How old are you?  We're big boys now.  Look, here he comes running.  He's on the bus.  Mars.  He takes that bus every day?  Mars, I noticed you're the only person that works here that takes a bus to work.  Everyone else takes a cab, has a ride. 
[00:03:00]  Or trains.  You're absolutely right.  You're the only one that takes a bus.  It's a good argument for a race.  Oh.  I think you make enough money where you can blow off the bus, though.  I really do.  I think you're being a little cheap with your money.  Yeah, a little frugal.  Well, actually, at the time that I have to come in, there's no trains by my area.  Is that what it is?  Ah, okay.  So it's not purely a financial thing.  Absolutely not.  It's a distance from the train station.  How far do you live from here?  Well, don't say... 
[00:03:30]  25 minutes?  By bus?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, actually, by car.  Yeah.  The bus probably takes you twice as long as that, right?  The bus is a big car.  Yeah.  Not really.  By wheels.  A bus stops every block.  That's got to be the biggest pain in the ass.  Blah.  But I'm not...  Blah.  Blah.  I hate the sound of the bus.  Blah.  Blah.  And then when it's, like, cruising and it's rocking back, it goes, blah. 
[00:04:00]  Blah.  Oh, shut up.  I hate the bus.  Anything worse?  You would really love to hear that and the Canadians talking all the time on the bus.  Canadians?  What are they doing on the bus?  Got a lot of Canadians on the bus.  Why?  It's New York.  Why?  Because they work at UPS.  Is Canadians a euphemism for...  Oh.  Oh.  You racist son of a bitch.  I thought about the Canadian word.  You would think a Reekin wouldn't be as racist as an Anthony.  If you think it... 
[00:04:30]  You know something?  I'm just thinking Canadians and I'm thinking Canadians.  Canadians.  Wow.  Why so many Canadians?  I thought they were called Mondays, huh?  I got you now.  God damn the racism is alive and well on this fucking show.  Even the Reekins got a little streak in them.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't like that.  It goes absolutely.  See, that's the beauty of the whole thing.  So every single person listening right now has a bit of the racism in them.  Of course.  But they don't want to admit it.  We all do.  That's what I just said.  We all do.  Everybody. 
[00:05:00]  Everybody.  Everybody has a little racism and a little hypocrisy in them.  There you go.  A little bit of that hypocrisy as well.  I got a lot of racism.  No hypocrisy.  No hypocrisy.  You're right.  You're the only man alive that has no hypocrisy.  You're amazing to all of us.  I got both.  But anyway, so no one could get here yesterday and then we said, you know what?  Oh, fuck it.  We're such great radio fucking stars.  We should take a day.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And do a little of that relaxing. 
[00:05:30]  We got, what, another 19 inches of snow in Central Park.  That's where they officially measure it for New York.  Yeah, 19 inches there.  Out on Long Island where I was, even more than that.  More than 19?  Perhaps more than that.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  North Shore, middle of Long Island got hit pretty good.  Right.  But, you know, it snowed more in New York than, where the fuck did they say?  Fargo?  Was it Fargo?  I don't know.  I think it was somewhere up there in Alaska.  Yeah.  They said, we're getting more snow in New York City than Alaska for January. 
[00:06:00]  It's my deal here, see.  36 inches in the month of January for New York City.  That's, I can't express how insane that is for the people listening elsewhere.  We don't get that much snow in New York.  Some winters we get, what, a dusting here and there, maybe a couple inches total for  the whole winter.  We had a few of those in a row.  Yeah, there have been storms where you get like two inches of snow and then it warms up.  That melts.  Right.  You don't see snow for a while.  Then you get a dusting and then maybe you'll get another three inches and everybody will 
[00:06:30]  go, oh, that's crazy.  This has been, since the first time it snowed, it hasn't been warm enough to melt that snow.  Right.  So it just keeps piling on top of each other.  So you get these giant drifts, these big snow plow piles in the parking lots.  Right.  They're mountainous.  You go to a mall parking lot, it's around the perimeter, mountains of snow.  See, I love all that.  It makes the winter go by a lot faster when it's snowing.  Yeah.  I kind of like it. 
[00:07:00]  What I don't like is the single digit crap, which we haven't really had.  We've had maybe one day of that.  That's what I can't fucking stand.  Yeah, the blasting cold sucks, but the snow is cool.  It's 30 degrees right now and a lot of snow out there.  It just makes the days go by a little faster.  Yesterday I decided, all right, I'm up.  Right.  I was ready to go.  I'm not going to go back to sleep.  So I just got online, started up a fire in the fireplace.  Nice. 
[00:07:30]  And did a little fireside chat with some people.  Oh, very good.  It was fun.  It was nice.  Got to talk with some listeners and shit.  Sounds awful.  Hung out.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Oh, what a day.  You can talk with some listeners.  What a day it was.  Actually, I listened to them talk.  I opened up the mics for them and, oh, God, do they have nothing to say.  Do they all talk at the same time?  Oh, no, thank God.  Only one at a time.  Oh, that's good.  But it's just one idiot at a time.  Right.  Well, I was up as well, Anthony. 
[00:08:00]  Were you?  And I decided that I needed to go to the emergency room.  Why?  What happened?  I know what happened.  I just have to say that.  Wait till Jimmy hears this one.  I decided that I'd been a bit stressed out lately.  How did you fall onto a football trophy like that, though?  Because I've heard the story.  A ladder, I'm changing a light bulb.  Right.  It's just.  Look, man.  The x-ray is fantastic. 
[00:08:30]  I fell sideways into a doorknob.  I don't know what happened.  So I got my doorknob ass to the ER.  And I decided to go back to, like, yoga.  Yoga.  And do some.  I thought you'd smile.  And do some.  Yeah.  Just kind of mellow out.  Relax.  Yeah, I've been a little fucking.  Chillax, as they say.  I've been a bit high strung for the last couple of weeks.  So I said, you know what?  It's time to get back to some yoga.  So I go. 
[00:09:00]  And I had a fine yoga session.  Really nice.  And I was, like, so fucking chill.  If you do it right, you feel like you're high or something.  Nice and relaxed.  Yeah, it relaxes the shit out of you, right?  I know I'm embarrassed that I'm even admitting that I do a little yoga here and there.  But I did.  Physical activity is nice.  So then I decided, as I was leaving the yoga studio, I don't need to put my shoes on all the way.  Why would you need to do that?  So what did you do?  Just shove your fucking feet in there with your heels hanging out of the back? 
[00:09:30]  Exactly.  Exactly.  I do that sometimes.  We all do it.  So, and it already started snowing.  You know, the big snowstorm already started.  But I'm pretty close to my house.  So then I hit the marble stairs.  The marble staircase.  The marble staircase.  And I'm doing well.  Yeah.  And then halfway down, all I know is I'm on my fucking back.  This is the second time you've fallen down steps.  Because I got, because my back is a little fucked up. 
[00:10:00]  So I'm a little, I'm a little unstable on my feet.  That's the only reason I didn't put my shoes on because my back was fucking hurting.  Another reason why I'm going to yoga.  And so I'm like, you know what?  I'll tie my shoes at the bottom of the staircase.  That makes sense.  You certainly will.  Right.  Is it the one that's a couple blocks from us?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  And I made such a fucking noise.  And they're all upstairs still.  They had to have heard me.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  And I'm like, I just went from this peaceful fucking state.  Nice.  To this, holy shit, I think I broke my foot within seconds.  Within seconds.  And my hand.  My hand, my fucking left foot.  I think that was about it.  Because then I wanted to protect my back when I felt the famous banana slip.  That's what it was.  Kind of.  Oh, yeah.  Your feet came out from under you.  So I quickly put my hands down and slammed this one into the.  That'll get your wrist.  Into a stair.  And then, I don't know how this happened.  This is what made Ant laugh really hard when I told him. 
[00:11:00]  My shoes went flying.  My shoes fell off.  I fell down the stairs.  And my shoes came off.  I was very hurt.  Very hurt.  My shoes went flying.  Because you know what it is?  After all said and done, that's the degradation.  Yeah.  Like, you've hurt yourself.  You're laying there.  And your shoes are off.  Yeah.  It's like degrading.  Because now, you've got to put your shoes back off.  They went flying.  The noise I made. 
[00:11:30]  And I know, like, I don't fit in with the yoga people.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  And I know they're still upstairs.  And they heard this racket.  And I'm like, I already don't fit in.  I don't want them to know that the weirdo in the class,  that obviously doesn't belong here,  you know, just fell down the fucking stairs after meditating.  Sue everyone.  So I got up and immediately went, holy shit, I just broke my foot.  Holy fuck.  The pain was unbearable.  Was your head bashed upon?  I protected my head. 
[00:12:00]  But I had to find my shoes.  They went flying.  I couldn't even see them.  I lost my shoes and my LASIK surgery.  One of my shoes was around, like, bottom of the stairs, around to the left.  So you had to look for your shoes.  Oh, even more degrading.  And then I had to walk down the rest of the stairs.  And then my socks are getting wet.  Because obviously everyone ran upstairs with wet feet.  That's probably why you slipped.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the buildings in New York, they lay down that rubber and shit. 
[00:12:30]  Because, I mean, the lawsuits from people slipping is just through the roof.  I could easily sue this building, but I certainly will not do that.  Oh, God.  So then I hobbled home.  And because I'm kind of in a still sort of meditated state, I said, you know what?  I'm just going to go to bed.  So yesterday morning I woke up and, you know, the show was canceled.  Not because of my foot, by the way.  But I woke up and it was just fucking throbbing, throbbing, throbbing.  I'm like, I got a fucking broken toe or a broken foot. 
[00:13:00]  So I'm like, you know what?  I'm up.  It's 4.35 in the morning.  I'm going to go to the emergency room.  Emergency room.  19 inches of snow out there.  Yeah, yeah.  So I put my shoe on, which made it way the fuck worse.  Yeah, once you take the shoe off and then put it back on.  Just imagine, like, stubbing your toe really bad and then putting on a tight shoe.  Yeah.  Just imagine the pain that would cause.  I think we would have all jammed our toe at one point.  It just is a fucking pain.  You know the deal.  Pain.  So then I get outside my building.  I'm looking for a cab.  There's no cabs to be had. 
[00:13:30]  So I decided logically, because this makes sense, I'm awake.  I need to get this checked out.  I'm going to fucking walk to the hospital.  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of going to the hospital?  Jimmy knows how far the hospital is from us.  I'm going to walk.  So every step is like, holy shit, holy shit.  I'm hopping.  I'm walking on my heel.  I'm doing whatever I can to get to the fucking hospital.  Now, the cabs are out.  But they decided, because it's such a horrible snowstorm, they don't want to have to, like, bring someone to a god-awful place. 
[00:14:00]  So they all have their out-of-service lights on.  Yeah.  And it's obvious I'm hobbling.  I'm like, will you give me a fucking break and pick me up?  Because it's not that far.  It's far enough, though.  So no one would pick me up.  And then I got to the hospital.  I was there for three fucking hours.  How long did it take you to walk there?  Probably a half hour.  No one ever goes to the hospital.  With every step being, oh, God, I don't want to put my foot down.  Just planning that foot.  No one ever goes to the hospital.  I was 10 minutes.  No.  I had 10 minutes. 
[00:14:30]  I was in and out.  But I, yeah, and that's why I never get my shit checked out, ever.  Because I don't want to deal with the waiting bullshit.  It just takes too long.  Right.  I would rather have a broken toe.  I would rather have a fractured hand than actually go to the emergency room.  Because you're right.  Yeah.  Why does it have to be three or four hours?  It's all that paperwork and bullshit.  Well, I walked in, and there was no one waiting.  So I went right in.  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, wow, you guys are slow.  And they're like, yeah, because of the storm and because of the hour. 
[00:15:00]  They're like, well, you imagine it'll be crowded in the next few hours.  So I got my paperwork done in seconds.  I'm in a room in seconds.  They finally come in an hour later.  Then another hour, they're like, yeah, we got to get x-rays.  And then another hour, they come back finally and go, yeah, you could go home.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Even though the first doctor said, yeah, that is definitely broken.  But it turns out it's not.  It's contusions or whatever.  The fuck?  Contusion.  Oh, it's swollen and black on the bottom. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I just showed.  Oh, God.  It looks like a dead toe.  Would you think less of me if you holding your foot up like that gave me a pounding erection?  It looks like a dead toe.  It's dark blue and purple.  So, and then guess what?  I had to walk back home.  Still no cabs.  Hobble.  Hobble.  So, that was my morning, but I fell after yoga class and my shoes went flying. 
[00:16:00]  My shoes.  But I don't know how I did that with my shoes on.  That's what I don't understand because I didn't hit nothing.  Yeah.  So, I guess maybe the heels of my feet twisted.  I don't know.  I don't know how I did it.  It's very hard to walk with just your toes in the shoe because it feels like you're wearing high heels.  Right, right, right.  You're doing that wacky walk.  Yeah.  And then go down.  Because we all know how it feels wearing high heels.  Yes, we do.  It makes you feel pretty.  You probably just panicked and kicked your legs and made like, ah, and just kicked your shoes off. 
[00:16:30]  I have no idea.  Wet marble stairs with fucking your shoes half on.  Yeah, that's good.  With an unstable back.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's good.  People are saying they'll chip in and get you a hover around.  You could drive your hover around.  Fuck.  That sucks.  So, I didn't enjoy my snow day.  You had your nice fireside chat.  Nice fireside chat.  And I'm in the emergency room for four hours.  It was just under four hours.  Just under four hours.  I'm like, I know this isn't a major emergency. 
[00:17:00]  I even said to the lady, I'm like, I'm not the type of person that comes in here and I probably shouldn't even be here.  I just want to make sure the foot's not broken.  Because you know when you break a toe, there's nothing you can really do.  No, they can't put a little tiny toe cast on there.  They tell you to do a buddy splint.  Ew.  That sounds like something with docking.  Yeah, a buddy splint.  Yeah, let's do a buddy splint.  Me and you.  They suggested a buddy splint for the next few days.  That's something you hear whispered through a hole in the fucking stall door at the bathroom.  Buddy splint? 
[00:17:30]  Buddy splint?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's when you rub poppers on both sides of your cock for the other man to smell it while he services it through the dirty hole.  A buddy splint.  It does sound gay.  Yeah.  It's like while you're sucking the dick, you put your one nostril closed and you tilt towards the ball.  And you breathe in.  I can get as graphic as you need.  Wow.  That's terrific.  That's a great name for a character, isn't it?  Detective Buddy Splint.  Buddy Splint.  Let me say hi to Striker Striker. 
[00:18:00]  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Oh, where was the idling vacuum cleaner in Jack Nicholson when you were late?  Oh, your shoe was askew.  Yeah, exactly.  You're at the bottom of the stairs.  You never want to fall and have your shoes come off.  Shoes coming off is very embarrassing.  Humiliating.  But at least my shoes were on halfway.  When you see, like, all of a sudden a shoe just laying in the road after an accident, you're like,  how the fuck does a shoe that was tied on tight go flying like that?  Fully tied tight.  It's just, it's physics.  It's that old, you know, an object at rest. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  And for most of the time at the hospital, the old lady next to me was screaming bloody murder  that she needs someone to get her water.  I don't even know what her deal was.  Delusional old bag.  Just screaming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was a lot of helps.  Help me.  Help me.  I need water.  Can you get me some water?  No.  And the funny thing is, not one person even fucking jumping for her. 
[00:19:00]  Why would they?  They all just ignored her.  Shoes in the middle of the road.  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  Perfectly tied gentleman's dress shoes.  Yeah.  Just in the middle of the road.  Both of them.  He knocked right out of his shoes.  And you know what?  You go to the ER that early?  A lot of homeless guys.  Really?  Just warming up?  Just warming up.  I don't know how they, they have figured that one out.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It can't be denied.  They're in those like, you know, those examination rooms that, you know, and they're just hanging 
[00:19:30]  out, snoozing.  And then by the time I left, one of them left too, and they were fine.  So I don't know how they are able to get, you know, get the ride to the hospital for  the night.  I think they go in there and say like, ah, I'm injured.  Right.  And they can't be turned away.  And they know it's going to take forever, so they'll get a nice snooze out of it.  Yeah, they get a snooze, and then they get up and leave when they're thrown out.  Better than the snowy sidewalk, right?  I guess so.  I bet, I bet you they have all the scams down.  They probably know, though.  They know all this shit.  It's like, oh, look, here he comes again. 
[00:20:00]  You were here last night.  Right.  You're fine.  We need the beds for paying customers.  Yeah.  So that was, that was my fucking morning.  But the good news for me, I'm sorry to the people that hate me that I don't have a broken  foot.  I'm going to be in pain for the next four to six weeks.  The fact is, the toe is just fine.  I was very hurt.  My feelings were hurt.  Oh, boy, were they.  I was mortified.  Looking for your lost shoe.  I couldn't find the left one.  With your swollen toe and holding your wrist, looking for your shoes. 
[00:20:30]  What a pathetic scene.  Poor little piggy can't even eat roast beef because he's too sore.  Oh, man.  Can't wee, wee, wee all the way home.  Every step just excruciating pain as I'm hobbling to the hospital.  Ow.  Yeah, that'll fucking hurt.  Yeah, that's a good day off for you.  Yeah.  I was in the emergency room.  It was terrific.  You know what's interesting?  It's like when you realize how easy it is to fall.  I didn't fall, but I was in the shower, and I heard a noise, and I thought someone was  breaking in my apartment. 
[00:21:00]  I just get paranoid sometimes.  As I'm walking back in, I step.  You know how you ever step in the shower, and one foot's out, and then your inner foot  in the shower goes, and you slip, and I just smashed my leg a little, but I'm like, that  was an inch away from being paralyzed.  You're falling right when you're fucking back.  Cracking my spine on the fucking, on the tub thing.  It's so easy to hurt yourself.  You're in the shower.  Yes, I was.  You're, uh, you're, uh, soaping up.  Ooh.  And, uh, you hear something you think is an intruder. 
[00:21:30]  What would you do if it was, Jimmy?  You're naked.  You're soaped up.  You're, you're in the shower.  You probably have no weaponry around.  I'd probably just try to turn him on with my seductive, my lathered up body.  Did you think, like, oh, I heard something.  Did you, do you start thinking, like, in your mind, like, okay, what can I do?  Do you look around for something?  Like, I have, I have no comprehension what you would do in that situation.  I think, I really do think, I feel like someone's gonna break into my bedroom, because you walk  into my, my apartment, and then you go to the right, and there's my bedroom, and in my 
[00:22:00]  bedroom is my bathroom and shower, and I, I feel like, like, if I don't just look, all  of a sudden, the door's gonna be kicked open by somebody with a pistol.  And your, and what, what do you mean, you'll just shit your pants?  Yes.  I shit my shower.  Right.  Wouldn't be the first time.  I don't know, it's irrational, but it's like, you know, you just check.  No, it's not.  You just check.  I do the same thing.  Like, especially.  Do you have a waterproof gun that you shower with?  Actually, I do hang, hang the belt and holster on the towel rack right outside the shower 
[00:22:30]  door.  Sure, that's good.  That's not childhood trauma.  I mean, that's totally rational as an adult.  But that way, if you hear anything, you know, you're not caught off guard.  You're right there, wet, naked, but ready to rock.  Jesus.  How awful would it be if you broke in to commit a rape and you see Anthony naked and dripping with a pistol?  What a buzzkill.  That would be.  Dripping with a pistol and a gun in his hand.  Oh, jeez.  I have two guns.  Oh, this is my rifle. 
[00:23:00]  This is my gun.  Oh, speaking of that joke.  What?  This is for fighting.  This is for fun.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Wait, what was that?  What happened?  Bad tape day.  Well, we're not doing bad tape day because Anthony can't find his bad tape.  I got it.  We were supposed to do that two days ago.  Joe Curry has the cassette, but he's out of state.  That bastard.  Well, we fucking promoted his stupid gig.  Tell him to get the damn tape to you.  I know. 
[00:23:30]  He's at some holly place or something tonight, I think.  He's in Michigan in the middle of nowhere.  Michigan or something.  Really fast.  Brenda in Jersey.  Go ahead, Brenda.  Listen, Opie, I had broken my foot over in June, and when I went to the hospital, they  told me, oh, no, it's just this brain.  They took the x-rays.  It took me a week to get back to another doctor before I found out I had fractured my foot  and was in a cast for two months.  So I would definitely get an MRI done.  Nah.  It's not fractured.  I'm done.  I did the right thing. 
[00:24:00]  I walked in the snow to the ER, and they say it's not busted.  I don't think the foot's busted anymore.  I mean, the toe hurts like the worst fucking stub toe ever.  Yeah.  And even if they missed it and it is broken, there's nothing you could do.  So I'm going to fucking buddy splint it.  Buddy splint.  And mellow out this weekend, and hopefully by Monday I can start doing some of the shit  I usually do.  Let me tell you that.  All right.  Brenda.  Hold on.  Ant's got something.  No, I'm just saying, Brenda is a perfect example of what happens on this show when anything 
[00:24:30]  happens to one of these staff.  Yeah.  You talk about it, you say what happens, and then they call up with a ten times more horrific  thing that could be wrong with you.  It never fails.  It's like, oh yeah, I fucking slammed my finger in the car door, and god damn, look, it's swollen  and stuff.  And then you get the call.  The guy will be like, it's anal cancer.  Dude, I swear, I did that once, and a piece of the paint chip from the door got into my  bloodstream and gave me blood poisoning, and my plane died, and they brought me back, and 
[00:25:00]  I got fucking, yeah, my finger hurt.  Shut up.  Right, exactly.  With your fucking.  Hey, Brenda's just trying to take care of me, and I appreciate it.  I am.  I appreciate it.  I didn't want to add in the part about six weeks later, I ended up with a blood clot in  the same leg.  See, now you lost me.  Blood clot.  Now you lost me, and I was sticking up for you.  You gotta go.  You gotta go.  Fucking listen to them.  You gotta go.  With their awful stories.  Chad in Massachusetts. 
[00:25:30]  Chad.  Chad.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Ready for this one?  I'm on vacation with my son, right?  And we're in a swimming pool.  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  I'm all fucking wet.  Right?  Yeah.  So they go, uh.  Will you stop snapping your fingers?  Exactly, we get it.  It's not 1950, Bowser.  Go ahead.  He has a weird stutter.  He has to sing his call.  Right.  Dup, duh, duh, duh, duh.  I fell down the steps.  All right, go ahead, Chad.  So they have some lacquered stairs, right, that went up to a, it was a spiral staircase 
[00:26:00]  that went up to this thing.  So my kid says, hey, let's go up there.  And I said, I really don't want to, you know?  And then I said, you know what?  We're on vacation, so fuck it.  Let's go.  So we start going up the stairs.  And I'm fucking cool.  All I hear is him snapping his fingers.  That's all I hear, too.  I don't even know what he's saying.  Do you still get residuals from the opening of the Addams Family?  That was him.  Go ahead.  Sorry, sir.  Sorry.  Something about a staircase, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, then I tell him, take it easy, you know?  Don't fall down the stairs.  Don't fall down the stairs. 
[00:26:30]  Right?  So we get up to the top, and there's absolutely nothing up there.  We got to the top.  Absolutely nothing up there.  Right?  So on the way down, I'm telling him, hey, make sure you're careful, right?  It's over.  I can't.  I'm lost.  My foot goes in the friggin' bars and splits the webbing of my toe.  In his foot, went in the bar.  But, but, but, but.  Whoa.  Wait.  I heard one thing, though, that just fucking skeeves me out.  The webbing of your fucking toe split?  Yeah, my toe went in the rail.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh.  And I fell down to the bottom, and there were these ladies eating lunch underneath the stairs. 
[00:27:00]  And I'm fucking trying to get up.  You know, I'm friggin' hurt bad.  And the ladies are like, are you all right?  And I'm like, no, I'm fine.  You know, no problem.  Fucking embarrassed as hell, right?  Heck yeah.  So I get outside, and my kid's like, let's go in the pool.  And I'm like, fucking room now.  With the ticking and talking going on.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I literally.  Thank you, Chad.  Yeah.  No, no, Chad.  It's all right.  But you've officially called with the worst story I've ever heard. 
[00:27:30]  I don't even know if he was back, because he was just snapping his fingers the whole time.  Oof.  Let me go to Monica in Pennsylvania.  Monica.  Yes.  What's up?  I just wanted to ask a question for Opie.  How come you had to walk to the hospital?  How come you didn't have a ride?  How would I have a ride?  You didn't have a ride?  No, I tried to get it.  Kenny had a flat.  Yeah, Kenny had a flat in Jersey, and I tried for a cab, plus there was 19 inches of snow 
[00:28:00]  on the ground.  Is that how much we got?  Yeah.  Basically, from where me and Jimmy live in our area to the main roads here in New York,  let's say, they weren't plowed yet.  It was a path.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Are you okay with that answer?  You're right?  Anything there?  Yeah, that's okay.  Yeah, that's good.  I thought that.  Do you think that I just have a car waiting for me at my beck and call?  Because that's so not me.  It would be nice.  It would be nice, but it's not me. 
[00:28:30]  Kenny picks me up.  The only reason Kenny picks me up is because he's driving in from Jersey, and he swings by  and grabs me.  That's the only reason, or I would be cabbing it every day to work.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you, Monica.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Hey, speaking of brain injuries, did you see this idle thing?  I heard tell of it.  I think we should play this to see where we're at emotionally as a show.  Is this hilarious, or does it get a tear flowing? 
[00:29:00]  Funny or sad?  Yeah.  Or gay?  You've got to throw gay in there.  Of course you do.  It probably won't be, but yeah.  Actually, it'll test everyone's soul out there.  Yeah?  Some people will feel themselves getting a little moisture in their eyeballs.  Would Bob Kelly cry at this?  Oh, yeah.  And others are going to just laugh openly.  Let me toughen up.  Give a ball.  Go ahead.  I don't care about anything.  No emotion.  Push it down.  Push it down.  American Idol's so desperate without Simon Cowell, they decided we need someone with 
[00:29:30]  a brain fucking injury to get people watching.  That's what I think.  My name's Bobo, and I want to sing a song.  That's what I think.  Why else would they have this on TV?  I have enough problems in my life.  I don't want to have to deal with your problems now that I saw you on TV.  Exactly.  And because she was on TV, they're getting all sorts of donations, and I'm happy for them  as far as that goes.  But I don't want to see this on my TV when it's supposed to be an easy little show to 
[00:30:00]  watch.  Now, what type of injury?  Is this a visual?  Can you look and say, oh, there's a problem.  Boy, is it visual.  Yeah.  Let me just play the first clip.  Chris talks about his fiancee.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is supposed to be a light show that you just throw on before you go to bed.  I mean, it wasn't a contestant.  It was his girlfriend?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I didn't understand that.  But he wheels her out.  Why would he do that?  I don't know.  Wait, wheels her out?  Wheels her out. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, no.  Wheels her out.  Is this it, Dan?  All right.  You want to, can I start the, let me start the audio.  Yeah, yeah.  Danny will catch up.  Are you married, dude?  No, I'm engaged.  I'm engaged.  Your girlfriend, though, you're here?  She, yes.  Is that her ring?  This is her ring.  Aw.  Tell us about her.  Oh, no.  The music.  I hate the guitar.  Tell us about her.  Tell us about her.  Here comes a story.  And then they did the blurry fade to, uh-oh. 
[00:31:00]  Wow.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Oh, no.  She's doing a montage of them together all in love.  She's kind of hot and everything.  There's him, uh, proposing at her Starbucks, I guess.  I guess she works.  Looks like a Starbucks.  He's fucking patty.  He's fucking kissing her.  She's.  All right.  Pause before we get to the fucking money shop.  She's pretty and stuff.  What happened?  She's really pretty.  Oh, no.  And they're young.  And they're in love.  This is going to be bad.  She's a man.  Fuck you, American Idol, for making me feel. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Juliana and I, we have been together for eight years.  We've been engaged for two.  Oh, no.  Going on three.  She says, wake up, it's no use breaking down.  You know, after we got engaged, we kind of made it a promise to get married two years  after the engagement.  Uh-huh.  But on October 2nd, 2009, she, uh, she got into an accident.  Oh, no.  Everything changed.  Cold tires.  We're still not here.  We're still not here.  We'll die inside. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, no.  Did they just say die inside in the song?  Oh, no.  She's wearing the fucking socks from the Wizard of Oz.  Yeah, I know.  They're terrible socks.  Curl up under the house.  I'm probably missing the point of the piece.  Maybe you are.  It's not about her socks, Jimmy.  What do you mean, terrible socks?  I wish I had those socks on right now.  My foot is aching.  I need some nice, soft, thick socks.  Yeah, but they're just, I need cushy Christmas socks right now.  They look like fruit-striped gum socks.  They really bother me. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, no.  Got into an accident.  Everything changed.  We're still not married.  We'll die inside these arms.  Know why they're still not married?  Because he doesn't want to marry a monster.  I don't know.  I haven't gotten a good look at her yet.  So they wheel her out?  She suffered a traumatic brain injury.  Even though the doctors were saying that she wasn't going to make it,  I believed 100% that she was going to.  I just felt there's no way she's not going to wake up. 
[00:33:00]  I didn't know what to expect after that,  but I certainly knew that she wasn't going to die.  And a month and a half later, she woke up.  What does this have to do with singing?  A month and a half later.  Jesus.  I know.  What does this have to do with singing?  He doesn't even get to sing.  He just tells a story and they go,  I'm going to have to say no, dog.  You're bumming me out, dog.  Yeah, you're bumming me out.  She woke up a month later while I was knee deep in a hooker's anus.  The phone rang while I had a girl named Destiny shitter on my nose. 
[00:33:30]  A month and a half later, she woke up.  Both her mother and I are her caretakers.  I was about to make vows just two months from the exit.  Oh, that was...  She was sick and thin until death do us part.  And sickness and health were better or worse.  What kind of guy would I be if I walked out when she needed me the most?  Smart.  Because that's what I would do.  I would be the worst boyfriend. 
[00:34:00]  I'm going to sing a breaky...  Pause that for a second.  I would fucking...  I told my girlfriend, God forbid you ever get fucking burned.  Because I'm telling you, I'll be out the door while you still have bandages on your face.  On her face.  I thought you were going to say on her hand.  On her left hand.  I'm the worst person alive.  Terrible.  Oh, she was like fucking all full of life and all pretty.  And then, oh, now she's just shaking in a wheelchair.  Oh, life stinks.  God, stop even believing. 
[00:34:30]  Wouldn't it be great if you were saying how guilty he felt now that he was dating a girl who stars in her own pornographic web films?  She stars in a lot of blacks and on blondes and videos.  She's my new girl.  Oh, God.  I had to leave old Lump of Coal behind.  I still haven't gotten a really good view of her here.  Well, just wait.  So, I mean, what do you think?  That American Idol goes down this road.  This has nothing to do with a singing competition.  This is such typical...  It's supposed to be a nice, light entertainment show. 
[00:35:00]  No, no.  Not anymore, right?  Typical, American, let's get the sob story in there thing.  Get everyone talking.  Get the guy.  Oh, he's the guy with the girlfriend.  Oh, I hope they don't vote him off.  Right.  Yeah, that's what they're looking at here.  Well, Chris performs.  Wait, so is he the singer?  So he's the singer.  So he's dragging her out to make his chances better.  Does he do Head Like a Hole? 
[00:35:30]  Oh.  What is he saying?  What is he saying?  No?  I thought he did.  I love that song.  What is he saying?  That opens up.  She's got legs.  Oh, my God.  There we fucking go.  Oh, my God.  Train's leaving the station.  Jump aboard if you must.  Well, she has a brain injury.  She's in a wheelchair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Brain damaged by Pink Floyd, but that might be a little obscure.  Rolling on the river.  Walk like an Egyptian.  All right, there you go. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, no.  There you go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Brain stew.  Oh, no.  Brain day action.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Can't think of any really popular songs to tie in with brain injuries.  Oh, God.  I'm going to sing something from The Wizard of Oz.  I was driving down the street. 
[00:36:30]  I can't use my feet.  I just sit here like a slab of meat if I only had a brain.  Well, I hit my head.  Now I just lie here in bed.  Oh, no, this is terrible.  I don't think it's terrible, though.  If they're going to do that to us, then we should be able to joke about it.  This is how we deal with sadness.  We're very immature. 
[00:37:00]  We are very.  We can't take it.  I'm very sad about this.  I'm very sad about this.  The creeps.  But the guy drags out his girlfriend in the wheelchair, right?  Yeah.  And I guarantee I don't watch the show.  I don't know how this ends.  They move him on to whatever stage they're at.  So he gets to move on because of this story.  Yeah.  I would assume his voice is average.  Well, let's see.  Chris performs for the judges.  All right.  Let me see some of her there.  I'm going to sing Breakeven by the script.  Go for it.  All right. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, I'm still alive, but I'm barely breathing.  Sounds like our phone call.  Just pray to God that I don't believe in.  Oh, and I got time while she got her freedom.  Because when her heart breaks, no, it don't break even.  Even.  Oh.  What am I going to do when the best part of me was always you? 
[00:38:00]  And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're okay?  Yeah.  I'm falling to pieces.  Yeah.  You missed that.  I'm falling to pieces.  I'm falling to pieces.  I'm falling to pieces. 
[00:38:30]  When a heart breaks, no, it don't break even.  Yes, he does.  Nice.  Nice.  So, you know a little bit about singing.  Is that worth moving on?  Definitely.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Whether he goes, you know, how far he goes, but that's definitely a, you're going dog.  Yeah.  Whether he wheels her out or not, I think.  I think he should have saved her for a later competition where it was a little more, a little tougher.  He pulled her out too early.  Yeah, he pulled her out too early.  When the competition gets tougher, that's when you bring out the vegetable. 
[00:39:00]  He played the vegetable card.  Oh, my God.  Look, he missed a note, then you hear, wheel it in.  Yeah, right.  Look, before you make your decision.  Yeah, hold on, hold on.  Open that curtain, please.  If I don't go on, she's going to pay for it.  He balls up his fist.  Oh.  I hate when they force this shit on you, though, man.  I don't want to.  He was good, though.  He was good.  Abdul in Jersey, what do you got?  Boom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, his next song should be, I used to love her, but I had to kill her.  Let's say hi to Mike in Boston.  Mike.  Mike.  Good evening, boys.  Hey, Mikey.  I think his next song should be Dave Matthews' Crash.  Well, that's not bad.  That was a huge song for Dave Matthews.  It definitely fits the bill.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Let me go to Jake.  Jake, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Jake. 
[00:40:00]  Can you wake my kids, Jake?  This show came out, what, Wednesday night?  And my fucking wife is still pissed at me from Wednesday because she asked me the fucking  question, would you stay with me if that happened?  And I'm like, are you fucking kidding?  I'll go to the supermarket and never come back.  Jake's a heartless fuck.  That's, yeah, it's certainly a tough question.  Certainly is a tough question.  I mean, I guess if you could get a little side, you might stay in that. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then the next day, on Thursday, she's watching that fucking Access Hollywood, whatever.  Then they show a clip of what he proposed to her in the fucking Starbucks.  They showed the video of that.  And that, again, started it up again on Thursday.  Oh, wow.  American Idol is smart because everyone's talking about this moment they had.  Oh, God.  Getting the fucking ratings up there.  Well, are you ready?  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Sean, or whoever that was.  Okay.  The judges finally meet Chris's fiancée. 
[00:41:00]  You ready to go, Danny?  I got to see this.  I don't want to.  Get your girlfriend.  You got to bring her back and introduce us to her.  We got to meet her.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, please.  Oh, my God.  That would make her day.  They want to meet Julie?  I got to tell you, man, I am so happy right now.  Ten miles from town.  Song again?  Yeah, that's Chris Daughtry, one of the big idol rock stars there.  What, Danny?  This is just...  Danny said.  I just can't believe that they're making a big reveal out of the handicapped person. 
[00:41:30]  A big reveal.  That's exactly what it is.  It's like, hey, look.  Here it is.  Because the reaction is going to be like, holy shit.  Everyone watching is going to be like, holy shit.  And sure, some people are going to have some tears in their eyes.  Of course.  This is a modern-day version of...  Ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  Hey, behind the curtain for a single nickel, you can see the freak.  The freak in the chair.  Right.  This is what they're doing.  We learned over the years, because we're all about the freak show.  We've always admitted that.  We're about the side show.  We love that shit.  And everyone listening loves that. 
[00:42:00]  I'm sorry.  Everybody does.  But in today's society, you're not allowed to charge 50 cents and show some freaks behind  a curtain.  No.  But if you do it in this way, then it's okay with the world.  That's fine.  Then it's okay with the world.  But Danny's right.  Wait, there's a big reveal, because it's a freak show about to happen.  Yeah.  We don't know this person.  I could care less about her and her story.  But now they're going to make you.  When you used to get to see Pinhead, you didn't give a fuck what that person was all about.  You're like, holy shit, look at this fucked up head. 
[00:42:30]  Fucking, you're a pinhead.  This was so worth 50 cents.  You're a big fat woman.  You got a beard and you're a lady.  Right.  But now TV has figured out how to continue the sideshow and continue the freak show in  a way where no one's going to yell and scream.  Ah.  Hi.  Hello.  How are you?  Hey, you.  Oh, they're talking like she's a puppy.  Yeah.  Hello.  Oh, no.  I'm Randy.  Hi.  How are you? 
[00:43:00]  Why do they have to walk over and touch her?  They're talking to her like she's a puppy.  Oh, she's shaking, causing a ruckus, misbehaving.  Those that are faint of heart, please do not enter.  You know, I just got fucking.  I just got really sad and I got a little moisture.  Did you get sad?  This doesn't make me.  I got sad.  I feel bad for her.  I can't for him.  I can't front.  I'm right in there with the jokes of everyone else.  But it's fucking brutal to see.  It doesn't make me sad because what they're doing.  And then they all get up and they're. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God.  They're petting her hair.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  I'm Randy.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  I'm Jennifer Lopez.  She's holding her IQ.  Hi, girl.  Steven Tyler.  I just heard your fiance sing.  And he's so good.  You know, because he sings to you all the time.  I could tell.  I love that.  That's why he sings so good, because he sings to you.  He's so bad.  I feel so bad.  So, Richard and Chris, you got three yeses from Steven, Jennifer, and myself. 
[00:44:00]  We discussed it while you were outside.  We discussed it when you went out to get her.  Dude, you're going to Hollywood.  We're going to Hollywood.  We're going to Hollywood.  We're going to Hollywood.  We're going to Hollywood.  Yeah, yo.  Yeah, dog.  Two tickets, and we'll see if we can get that room that you need in the hotel.  One with the wide bathroom door and the handles.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  Honestly, in the end, it made me really fucking sad.  Of course it does.  She was hot.  I can't fucking front. 
[00:44:30]  Like, she's moving around like Angus Young.  Oh, Jesus.  She looks just fucking.  Like something's going.  She's got GoFundMe eye.  You know how bad I'd feel for constantly cheating on her?  Oh, Jesus.  Because that's what I'd be doing with my American Idol fame.  You'd have to.  Believe me, while they were throwing her in the van, I'd be getting blown in the parking lot.  You'd hear that thing going up in the van.  Get Lumpy McGillicuddy on the fucking van.  I'm going to get a fucking Hummer here.  I'm going to dump a load in this starlet's mouth. 
[00:45:00]  This is terrible.  The end of that clip.  Oh, no.  Look how she used to.  Oh, God.  She's all made up.  That guy was probably like, I am so out of my fucking league with this chick.  He's got the potential of being fat.  But, and, and then he had this hot girl and now she's fucking.  Right.  She probably didn't want to go to American Idol, but he probably made her.  He's probably, look, this is going to be my ticket to the next round.  He probably took her feet and firmly planted them on the thing.  Don't move. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And you see, you see Tyler's jeans at the end of that?  He's got eyeballs on his fucking ass.  Let's not about it.  Tyler is a weirdo.  When people see him, he's making faces and he's just a weirdo.  Oh, geez.  Why don't they get her an electric wheelchair?  Exactly.  Like, it'd be more, I don't know, fun.  Maybe she can't use it herself.  Oh, oh, maybe someone's got push.  John in North Carolina.  Go ahead, John. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, John.  Mimi.  Hello.  Fellas, did he do his own tribute of walk this way to Stephen Tyler?  All right, look.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  All right.  It's a good question.  Great.  It's a great question.  You know I'm never going to walk this way.  Oh, no.  Oh.  All right.  Fuck.  That is a downer.  It sucks, dude.  Fucking sucks. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  But, I mean, come on.  All right, whatever.  We'll take a break.  We got Ricky Gervais on The Office last night.  Fucking doing something that we've been yelling and screaming about for two years now.  Yeah, people could do those things.  It's unbelievable.  And God bless them for doing it on The Office last night.  You've got to think JV and Elvis are smiling somewhere.  We'll explain next.  And also, you've got Tracy Morgan saying something about Sarah Palin at the Knicks game yesterday.  Certainly did. 
[00:47:00]  You've got Obama doing a Super Bowl pick.  And, of course, Charlie Sheen.  Do we have an update on Charlie Sheen?  Charlie Sheen.  Yes, he's awesome.  Yeah, he's awesome.  He's awesome.  He rules.  He's awesome.  Yeah.  We got a porn star.  Do you know Casey Jordan?  James Pitt.  I know the name, but I do not know her.  I know the name.  I can't place the vagina.  Can I see her vagina?  Oh, yeah.  They talked to Casey Jordan because she's... 
[00:47:30]  Oh, Charlie Sheen.  Oh.  I mean, the aquatic is going to break.  Oh.  I do know who she is.  Yeah, yeah.  You really know her?  Yeah, I loved her sunshine band.  She's skinny, but she could take a fat cock.  She's taking a fucking bat right there.  Wow, she has a big vag.  Yeah.  Can I see more of her meaty vag?  Yay, Casey.  Yeah, she's all right for a...  Wow, Jesus Christ.  Can she fucking...  Jesus, is that not my cock? 
[00:48:00]  Oh.  That's like when I try to pull the Escalade into my garage.  I had to pull the mirrors in.  That's what it looks like, that cock going to that vagina.  You have to tuck the balls in?  Yeah.  Like mirrors?  Very small.  Yeah, all right.  Well, we got a lot to do.  And we have so many people stopping by today.  Holy shit.  A lot of guests.  Well, some of the guests that were supposed to be here yesterday are coming back today.  All right.  Let me give you the list.  We got Bobby Lee, who's always awesome on the show.  He's great.  Bobby Lee rules.  He'll be here at eight.  You got Vinny and Uncle Nino in studio. 
[00:48:30]  Vinny from the Jersey Shore.  Do you watch the Jersey Shore?  Have you seen his uncle before?  His uncle's nuts.  I've seen clips.  You can barely understand him.  I haven't really seen the show.  But Vinny promised he would bring his uncle by, and that's happening today.  And that Jersey Shore is doing like eight million a week.  Wow.  Eight million viewers a week.  And Vinny becoming a friend of the show, that's pretty damn cool.  Russell Peters, a massive comic for the world.  He's famous all over the fucking world.  He'll be in here.  He's doing the Prudential Center, and he has a book out. 
[00:49:00]  Jesus.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  I saw him at Radio City Music Hall last year, and it's unbelievable.  He does comedy for the world with local references for the world, if that makes sense.  And then Jimmy booked Brooke Shields.  Really?  Your friend?  Yeah, I haven't seen her in a long time.  I wouldn't say we're friends, but I do like her.  She's actually really nice.  She hit it off with you and Patrice.  Yeah.  I remember you guys telling her.  Yeah, she was great.  You both have told good stories about her.  Yeah.  We'll have her in as well today.  Of course, she does Reg.  Oh, she's doing Reg first?  Come right here.  Nice.  Oh, no. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Right, right, right, right on my fucking foot.  Right, right, right on my fucking foot.  That fucking thing.  That fucking thing fell again right on my fucking foot. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Right, right, right, right on my fucking foot.  Fucking foot.  That fucking thing.  That fucking thing fell.  That fucking thing. 
[00:50:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:51:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show, damn it.  On the Virus Sirius XM.  This is the Virus Sirius XM.  Time is running out.  Tick tock.  The American middle class is shrinking every day.  You know the people that are hard-pressed, we have to help bring them up.  These economic challenges call for strong leadership, but not everyone agrees. 
[00:51:30]  Some people are starting to go like, hmm, does this guy know what the fuck he's doing?  Senator Nagel says Anthony Cumia is the Antichrist.  Of course.  Chairman Teff says Cumia will destroy us all.  Nope.  Chief Justice Roberts proclaims Cumia will wipe his ass with the Constitution.  Enough already.  Wise, benevolent, and even-tempered, Anthony Cumia has the solution to our nation's economic crisis.  Just tax the shit out of everybody. 
[00:52:00]  Liberal-minded philanthropist Anthony Cumia will restore balance to our nation.  It is like the old communist method of everybody gets a piece of the pie.  Say no to discretionary income.  Say yes to a mountain of costly social services.  This fall, vote for Anthony Cumia.  That's what I am.  Tax and spend Democrat.  You got it.  Paid for by the United Negro College Fund in cooperation with the NAACP.  Yay!  And now Jim Norton interviews legendary actor Alan Alda. 
[00:52:30]  Sorry, Alan, I just cut a guess or in your face.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Listen to that.  So, let's get to the meat of the issue here.  You had AIDS.  How long did you have AIDS for?  I think about six months.  I was really lucky.  I must have had a light case.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Alan, you were a bit of a disappointment.  Thank you very much.  It was fun talking.  You guys rock?  Yeah.  Who's this?  I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at anything in my life.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call 866-1211. 
[00:53:00]  That's 866-969-1969.  I want to say happy birthday to Alan Alda.  That's why you heard that little ditty.  How old is Alan?  He's 48.  48 years old, Alan Alda.  I ain't buying that.  75.  Holy shit.  He looks great, too.  Like I said, I see him walk around the neighborhood and no one gives a fuck.  You see him walking around and I never see him.  Were you here when I was talking about that? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  By time on it, right?  No, outside the pizza joint on Columbus Avenue.  Just walking by and not one person noticed it was Alan Alda.  Puts everything in perspective.  If enough time goes by, we won't even care about the Beatles.  Well, he's probably happy.  How many years will it take where we don't give a fuck about the Beatles anymore?  That's going to take a while, obviously.  I think we're getting close.  But there used to be a coffee slash dessert shop in my old neighborhood.  I'll tell you exactly where I lived.  On 71st Street and Columbus Avenue. 
[00:54:00]  And there was a little joint where Yoko and John used to go every day.  It was a major Beatles place.  When people wanted to check out all the Beatles shit in New York City, they stopped at this joint.  Yeah.  And there was a picture of John and Yoko in the window of them sitting at this particular table.  And then they put the table in the window.  And then it was a big deal when a hardware store decided they needed that space.  And they ripped down this historical Beatles place.  It was a biggie, right?  But on the walls in this joint were old opera stars from a long fucking time ago, from all 
[00:54:30]  the famous people in New York City around the turn of whatever, the 1900s?  I don't know.  And I remember walking in there looking at this wall going, there was a time when these  fucking people probably couldn't walk around New York City.  And I'm looking.  I didn't recognize one fucking name on that wall.  Good old days.  And it made me think, how long would it take for people to not even care about the Beatles?  If you think about old Hollywood stars and all that, there are people that used to be 
[00:55:00]  so famous that no one gives a fuck about and probably wouldn't even know the name anymore.  Ida Lupino.  There you go.  What?  Is that really one?  Yeah.  Oh, he said he nailed it.  It just popped in my head.  He fucking nailed it.  I was watching Twilight Zone last night.  But there's probably a time where he couldn't walk around, right?  Or it's a she.  Oh, a she.  See, I don't even know.  Thank you.  Exactly.  That proved the point.  You know what it is?  They didn't get the type of visual.  Well, like, Chaplin is amazingly famous considering.  He's still very famous.  I mean, you know, you could go on YouTube and check out Chaplin right now. 
[00:55:30]  But those people you can't watch in reruns and stuff.  Right.  I think now you stay famous longer because of the way people can kind of pass you along.  Like, Beatles can be, like, Beethoven had to be transcribed by other people.  No one's ever actually heard Beethoven.  But eventually, will that be part of the internet that no one really goes to anymore?  Maybe.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  It's just a dumb thought.  Who cares?  Obama.  This is why I hate politicians.  Right the fuck here.  What do you do now?  Obama was asked who he wants to win the Super Bowl. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  And this is what fucking drives me nuts about politicians.  Fucking pick a fucking team.  But they don't want to piss off, what, their people?  Yeah, they don't want to piss off the other team's people.  So this is what Obama said.  One of the most serious questions, according to some people, who Mr. Obama thinks will  win the Super Bowl, Pittsburgh, or Green Bay.  I bet you ducks.  I already took a hard time.  How did the Bears have lost?  I've got to stay neutral.  No picks.  I've got to say absolutely neutral on this one and may the best team win. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Why, Obama?  Can't he just have a fucking opinion as a guy?  That's why I don't like politicians in general.  I will.  They're all bullshitters.  I'm going to stick up for him on this.  Why?  Because it's a fucking do-nothing subject.  That doesn't really matter.  So I'll stick up for him so people can say that I actually did.  No, I really will, though.  Why?  Here's the deal.  Who cares if he pisses off voters?  I'd rather have an honest politician that could fucking make a decision. 
[00:57:00]  He's being honest.  You think he's really being honest?  For once.  Here's the deal.  The Jets lost.  Right.  I personally don't care who fucking wins the Super Bowl.  He said, since the Bears are out, because he's a Chicago guy, that he doesn't care.  It doesn't matter.  What team do you want to win the Super Bowl?  Not what team do you think.  No, no, I understand.  What team do you want to win?  Everyone knows I'm a huge Jets fan, and they're out, so honestly, I'm kind of in the same boat.  I don't care.  See?  But if someone asked me, I'm like, yeah, it would be kind of cool if the Packers win.  In the end, I don't care, though. 
[00:57:30]  There's no, like, passion for it.  But why can't he say a team?  He did.  He said the Bears.  Yeah, I guess.  You might have won this one.  In this case, it's not as bad.  I think you might have won this one.  It's not as bad as a Hillary Clinton fucking Mets-Yankees bullshit.  That's why I told him to pull the clip, because it brings me back to the Hillary Clinton,  where all of a sudden she was fucking switching baseball hats depending on who was doing well at one point.  Terrible.  Remember all that shit?  But really thinking that people would vote for you, because that's why people liked Rudy,  because he's a diehard Yankees fan. 
[00:58:00]  And no one gave a shit.  No one gave a shit.  And no one gave a shit.  But fucking Hillary had a, she spent time in Chicago, so she was what?  I don't even remember.  A Cubs or a White Sox fan?  That's important.  I think a Cubs fan.  And then all of a sudden she's wearing a New York Mets hat, but then she had to wear her Yankee hat.  It was all like, will you just stop?  Like, ah, I want to win here in New York.  Get the votes.  Yeah, I respected Giuliani that he stuck with his team and he wore his Yankee hat everywhere.  And even if they booed him in Shea Stadium, he understood what it was.  Like, it was the spirit of just getting... 
[00:58:30]  Oh, he'd wave.  Yeah.  He'd, like, wave.  Like, yeah, okay, whatever.  He's still the mayor of the city.  Thank you, man.  Yeah.  But he's being treated in that moment like an ordinary citizen.  Right.  And I think that's what people liked about him.  I think Ant's right on this one.  Yeah.  I think you're right.  He's a huge...  Now, if the Bears would have won and he said that, then it would have been horse shit.  Forget it.  Right.  But I think he honestly probably would have said...  Everyone would have expected him to say the Bears anyway, so...  Do we have the mayor's bets?  Are the mayor's bets in for the big Super Bowl? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, God.  Let's see.  Pittsburgh is betting an I-beam.  Right?  Yes.  We'll give you one I-beam.  And Bloomberg has promised to blow somebody, regardless of who wins or loses, because even  though his team's on that...  I was wondering where you were going there.  Yes.  He's going to go to Pittsburgh and Green Bay and put potted plants where cars should  be, and then yell, I'm a sissy, and spin with an umbrella.  Fucking idiot.  You blithering three-term sissy idiot.  He really is.  The Bloomberg mayor bet was so douche-chilly. 
[00:59:30]  I guess because the Steelers did beat the Jets.  Because Bloomberg has to hang a terrible towel on a New York monument.  Oh, no.  That was the bet.  Like, people would walk by like, oh, my God.  Like, a terrible towel.  Give the fuck.  The terrible towel was what he used to clean up with after sex.  So brown.  So crusted.  There's shit on it because, you know.  Exactly.  Maybe he can blame healthcare reform anti-people for the bombs over what's going on in Egypt.  Fucking asshole.  I wish I knew. 
[01:00:00]  We don't know what's going on in Egypt.  I was just bringing up a point that, like, the news really fucking does blow.  They talk about this protest and outrage that's going on in Egypt and Mubarak, they're pissed  at him, President Mubarak, over in Egypt.  But I can't figure out why they're mad.  Nothing, nothing I've read, no reports on the news have explained to me what this outrage is,  why they're angry, what they want, what Mubarak's not giving them. 
[01:00:30]  Like, there's no information.  They just like showing rioting and guns and saying, more unrest in Egypt.  Tell me what the fuck the unrest is about.  I'm going to guess it's because he's not hardline Muslim enough.  I could be wrong.  That'd be great.  But I'm going to guess it's because he's considered more friendly to the West than he should be.  I don't know.  And younger people that use the Internet and shit like that want a more restrictive Islamic government? 
[01:01:00]  I don't know if that's right or not.  That's just it.  I don't know if that's right or not.  I really don't know.  We should be able to know.  Okay.  Someone could call up and tell me what they need.  I just don't know.  It's the youth.  Young protesters want to end to Mr. Mubarak's authoritarian rule, which has used heavy-handed  security to crush dissenters.  Who complained about unemployment, inflation, and corruption, which has created a huge gap  between the rich and the poor.  Oh, there you go.  It's nothing like that.  I was totally wrong.  Yeah.  It's like Algeria and Yemen. 
[01:01:30]  The total opposite.  To demonstrate that led to the end of Tunisia's President Zine al-Abadi.  What's scary about this Egyptian thing is the fact they just shut down the Internet.  So these kids can't communicate with their Facebooks.  So they shut it down and they're not going to be able to have pillow fights and stuff.  Yeah, they shut down the Internet in Egypt and cell phone service, too.  They learned from Iran.  Remember when Iran was protesting and, man, their info got out through the Internet and 
[01:02:00]  through all the social networking sites.  And, well, Egypt and the rest of the world, I think, learned from that and said, fuck that.  If it gets a little too ugly, we're going to pull the kill switch.  And they can't do that.  And they're talking about doing that in America, right?  Yeah, I'm against that.  Yeah, they want some kind of legislation, though.  They're not just going to do it behind your back.  They want legislation that would give the president the power to pull the plug on the Internet.  Yeah, it's –  But that goes against what our country is all about. 
[01:02:30]  You should be able to protest and kind of get together and kind of, you know, crush some skulls if you have to.  This is supposed to be under the guise of national security where it's like if somebody hacks into something and it's sensitive.  That's all bullshit.  That's not why you're doing it.  But what this does and why Egypt pulled the plug is it's so easy now to get a large group of people on the same page than it used to be with word of mouth or flyers or mail or whatever the fuck you used to do.  Now you tweet something.  Right.  And you could get thousands upon thousands of people in one area of the same mindset, and that's more dangerous, I think, to any government than some kind of outside – 
[01:03:00]  It scares the shit out of them.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want the people to have too much power.  You don't want the people to be able to communicate in large groups.  But that's how our country was put together.  The people had all the power.  Yeah.  Not no more, though.  No, now it's, you know, oh, it's all about not being represented properly and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right, well.  Assholes.  Where's all the civil liberty people and the privacy advocates and the – where are all those people who would be screaming if it was the other way around? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, well, they're waiting for a Republican to do it.  Oh.  Ecto guy on Twitter said that Obama picked Pittsburgh in 08.  Steelers won in 08, right?  Did he?  I don't know my Super Bowls that well.  Well, I mean, they've won two with Roethlisberger, was one of them in 08 because this guy's saying Obama picked Pittsburgh in 08.  That was before he became the president.  I wonder if that's true.  Maybe he didn't like that he picked him. 
[01:04:00]  Who knows?  Hey, moving on.  There's so much going on today.  We've got a lot of guests.  But Ricky Gervais had a little cameo in the English office, which it made me watch.  American office.  I mean the American office, excuse me.  It made me watch last night.  It was like 10 seconds, right?  Him and Carell, it was a good scene to start the show.  A little exchange?  Absolutely.  Can't hate on Carell.  He did a good job with Ricky.  Yeah.  And you want me to just play it?  Yeah.  I want to hear this.  Okay.  I thought he was going to do a little more than this, but this was all of Ricky Gervais' cameo from last night. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, they're waiting for the elevator, obviously.  And Steve Carell is going to work, right?  Is that the setup?  Steve Carell's going to work?  Oh, is this the whole thing on, uh, you got it on.  Oh, okay.  They never really say, uh, where they're going or whatever.  You want to do it here?  Yeah.  Might as well.  Sorry, Mike.  Oh, sorry.  Mike?  Excuse me.  What are you doing? 
[01:05:00]  English.  You're taking the Mickey and you picked all the wrong person.  No, no, no.  I'm not picking on you at all.  You're English, correct?  Yeah, big time, yeah.  I'm working on an English character.  Would you mind, it's called Reginald Poofta.  Oh, David Brent, my liege.  How are you?  Michael Scott.  Oh, yeah.  I do characters as well.  I've got a Chinese fella, not politically correct, but he's called Holy F***.  That's not what it sounds like.  No, no, no.  And people don't understand that it has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality. 
[01:05:30]  No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself.  That's what she said.  Oh, girl, hugs him.  Pleasure to meet you.  Where are you working?  Dunder Mifflin.  Any jobs going?  No, not right now.  Just let me know.  All right.  See you around.  Bye-bye.  What a nice guy.  There you go. 
[01:06:00]  That was it.  What a nice guy.  That was it.  But doing the Chinese accent, they got J.B. and Ellis and others fired.  I like what he goes to.  Because you can't make fun of the Asians.  That's what she said.  Yeah.  What an awful...  That's exactly what he should have said.  That's just what adults would say.  It is context, though, because they're playing dummies that wouldn't realize that that  is a horrible thing to do.  Is it horrible, though?  I still question that part of it.  No, no.  I'm saying that...  No, it's not.  I'm just saying, like, the people that do think that's horrible. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  They would look at that and go, oh, he's pointing out that these two ignorant people are saying  this and don't even realize how awful it is.  That's what makes it acceptable.  Yeah.  Where are the Asian-American groups still protesting and all that stuff?  Where are they?  Yeah.  You know, herro, herro.  Yeah.  Where are they?  Did that offend Mr. Liu, John Liu?  I don't know.  Where are they?  Asshole.  Let's see in a few minutes when we fucking talk about Top Gun in China.  We're going to second that, but really fast.  So what do you think?  You think Ricky does more? 
[01:07:00]  Or is this it?  They obviously want you to talk about it and wonder.  They want you to speculate because Correll's leaving, right?  Yeah.  Correll's leaving and he asks, is there any jobs over there?  Yeah.  So they obviously want you to think that maybe this isn't a one and done.  That he comes in.  But Ricky's the type of guy, he's not going to tell anyone if he is going back there.  He'll deny, deny, deny until all of a sudden he shows up on there.  I wouldn't be surprised if they offered him a lot of money to do it.  Fucking lot.  And if he does maybe one season and says, all right, I'll do it for one season for you guys. 
[01:07:30]  Because he's not the type of guy that's going to do a Correll and do it for the next 10 years.  He definitely wouldn't do that.  One season.  Imagine one season.  One American season is fucking like three.  Three of their seasons.  But imagine one season with him.  The ratings on this fucking show.  Yeah.  I mean, it obviously does well already.  I'd watch it.  The only reason I'd watch.  I've never seen the American version.  I just want to see it for him.  I would be all in.  No problem.  But it does lead to the other thing that's happening that Ant saw on the TV.  I don't know this one.  The Chinese. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Well, there seems to be a little controversy going on in China.  China is building some jet aircraft, some military aircraft.  They unveiled one recently.  And they're very proud of him, I guess.  And they were showing some footage of one of these aircraft in action.  In action.  Right, right.  Which is pretty cool.  But the media, the pesky media did a little investigating and looked at the clips of what 
[01:08:30]  they said was some planes being shot down by their new fighter.  And side by side, frame by frame comparison, you will note that it is a clip from the movie  Top Gun.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  That their military is trying to pass off as actual footage.  You're kidding.  Of their planes.  They are fucking.  It's exact. 
[01:09:00]  I'm looking at the site.  Yeah.  It's the same fucking thing.  Which one is supposed to be the Chinese plane?  They're the same.  Fighter on the right, probably.  Well, the ones.  No, I understand the same picture.  But which one are they claiming?  The left, I think, is what China is saying.  Yeah.  Is them.  And the right is the actual.  The right is the HD version.  And the right is from the movie.  It matches up perfectly.  That's hilarious.  I mean, perfectly.  The blown out parts of the plane.  It's not even close.  Yeah, it's exact.  To being.  And they're trying to pass it off as, this is our plane. 
[01:09:30]  Very good plane.  Don't at all.  Hey.  That music might tip some people off.  Uh, this is our time playing.  Requesting a fry-bye.  Request denied.  Okay.  All I know about it.  Don't do the fry-bye.  Okay.  Oh, I love this song.  Gets you all geared up, doesn't it?  Oh, it sure does. 
[01:10:00]  Now, look at our plane.  Very powerful.  Also, we play a very good game of volleyball.  Watch us with no shirts.  We're very powerful volleyball players.  Except for Chang.  Now, Chang won't take his shirt off.  I don't know what that's about.  I hear he has three nipples.  I can look at it.  Goose is injured because someone is choking it and fucking it.  Oh, no.  Rice Man is winning.  Chopgun.  My partner and my real name here, he is Goose and Broccery. 
[01:10:30]  Where is Kerry McGirris?  His rust is edge.  His rust is edge.  What about when it slows down a little bit, the movie? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, when I take my breath away.  Oh, when I kiss your lips.  This I try to pick up garden bar.  And there's no tenderness like before in the fingertips.  Peeps.  I drive my Ahari Davidson.  You can be my chicken wingman any time. 
[01:11:30]  You've lost that roving fearing.  Oh, that roving fearing.  Oh, those wacky Chinese.  Now we'll get some complaints.  Fuck them.  Now they'll come in.  Well, they deserve to get beat.  Take my breath away. 
[01:12:00]  For using the Top Gun clips.  Yes.  That's fucking ridiculous.  Is that real?  Like anybody can't tell.  That's real shit going on?  Old fucking model airplanes being blown up with an M-80.  But one guy is like, wait a minute.  That looks way too familiar.  I got to go get Top Gun and match it up.  See the matches.  We are fly upside down.  Take a picture with the Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Polaroid.  Well, they didn't get away with it here, but I'm sure they're people. 
[01:12:30]  A fry-bye.  A fry-bye.  More fry-bye.  Yeah.  Take my breath away.  God, what band was this?  Berlin.  Berlin.  Berlin.  Jimmy, a fan?  I like this song.  And I did Marc Maron's show, Nevermind the Buzzcocks, with Wonder Mike from the Sugar  Hill Gang and her.  Oh, really?  She liked me, too.  I was really rude, and I thought that she was going to hate me. 
[01:13:00]  Does she still look kind of cute?  She looked okay, yeah, but that's probably like 10 years ago.  Oh, wow.  Speaking of Marc Maron, on his podcast, he had Gallagher.  Gallagher walked off.  Why?  So, uh, Marc Maron's getting a little, uh, a little talk going on.  Why Gallagher walk off?  Wow.  I don't know.  It's hard to get Gallagher to walk off the show.  If Marc Maron's up, maybe he could call the show and tell us real fast and plug the,  what the F, uh, or WTF podcast that he does.  I'm thinking because what?  He walked off halfway through the interview with Marc Maron.  Was he sensitive about that?  What do you mean, why did he walk off?  We've had him on two or three times. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, he's never walked off.  Yeah, but it seems like at any second he could.  For some reason, he just didn't.  Oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on.  Isn't Gallagher very, uh, conservative?  Uh, maybe.  I think politically, uh, Gallagher.  You think it was a political thing that made him walk off?  Probably.  I would bet it would be.  We love when Gallagher's on this show.  He's nuts.  He's fucking nuts.  He's fucking batshit crazy.  Uh, has.  Let's just, okay, let's go to Rob in Florida. 
[01:14:00]  Rob.  Hey there, Rob.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Hey, Anthony, I remember this.  When Barack made his comments about guns and God,  about the people of Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  Well, he got old man Rooney to help him win Pennsylvania  for the presidential election.  That's why he was back in the Steelers.  Said he made Rooney the ambassador to Ireland.  Ah, a little, uh.  That's how he got behind the Steelers in 2008.  Ah.  Political, you know, it was all political thing.  Now, I don't know who he's going for this year, but. 
[01:14:30]  But he really, uh, picked the Steelers?  Oh, yeah, he was back in the Steelers.  My friend who's a representative in Pennsylvania  watched the game with him at the White House.  But, yeah, he went with the Steelers  because Rooney helped him win PA  to get the presidency after his guns and God comments.  Mmm, ah, shenanigans.  Yeah, it was all for his own interest, you know,  because he's a Bears fan.  Oh, there you go.  Whatever.  All right, we got a little more info on that.  I just still don't think it gives a shit.  I don't give a shit who wins the Super Bowl. 
[01:15:00]  That doesn't matter to me.  That doesn't fucking matter to me.  Nah, but we'll watch, right?  Yeah.  You gotta check out the commercials.  I'd like to see the Packers win.  I don't want to see the fucking, uh.  Gotta watch the commercials.  I don't want to see what you want to call it.  The Waffles Burger.  Yeah, I don't want to see Pittsburgh get another one.  I'm going to start rooting for, um, whoever's winning.  That's smart.  Like, I'm not going to pick who I want to win until halftime.  And then I'll be like, oh, yeah.  Go, go, go.  I just clap for whoever looks better in their uniforms.  Oh, tight.  Yay.  I'm not gay, but I just respect and shade people. 
[01:15:30]  Boo.  Boo.  There's nothing to see here, folks.  Move along.  Let the voicemail from Aaron.  Yeah, I want to see what that Gallagher thing was about.  Uh, so the Chinese, they're doing that.  Yeah.  Top Gun clips.  That's their new weapon.  Right.  And their people probably are, like, fascinated and amazed by it.  That's hilarious, though.  They keep their people so dumb.  Fucking dummies.  That's fucking hilarious, though.  They didn't think that anyone would catch on.  That's probably going to be their fucking downfall. 
[01:16:00]  You know, Top Gun did win Oscars for their cinematography.  They did.  For all the, uh.  For all the aerial footage that was shot.  That was one of a kind of stuff.  No one had really done stuff like that before.  Back then, it was really cool, because they were using real jet aircraft.  That was all real.  And doing that.  No models.  The explosions, the blowing up planes were models.  Like the ones that blew up.  But the flying and shit, those were real fucking good.  If you're going to rip some shit off for your flight video, might as well take it from  some Oscar-winning performances.  Speaking of movies, that James Cameron movie, is that coming out today? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  That cave diving thing?  How is that going to be a good movie?  It's going to look very claustrophobic.  Because it looks very claustrophobic.  Visually, it's going to look great, but it seems to me that it's going to be a very claustrophobic  movie.  It's that, I forgot the name of it and where it is, but it's this huge.  Mexico.  Mexico?  I think so, yeah.  It's this huge hole in the ground that drops down and people fucking...  Do they go spelunking?  Oh, they do all that shit.  They skydive into...  What's it called?  I know.  I forgot the fucking name.  Base jumping. 
[01:17:00]  They base jump into it and there's water down there and then underground caves and all  that shit and James Cameron's making a movie about it.  They showed some clips where people are in like scuba gear and they're going around  these like thin little caves.  I couldn't imagine being in a small cave that is filled with water and you're like swimming  through there.  How claustrophobic would that be?  How do they get out though?  Exactly.  Is there steps?  You suppose...  Steps.  I would love... 
[01:17:30]  I have no idea, but that's a great, great question.  How much should you build steps?  Or an elevator?  Or the old Eska?  I've done a lot of scuba diving and I would love to go into a fucking cave.  I would want to be with people that know what they're doing.  Because I'm not that good, certainly.  But I would love to check it out.  If you're with people who know what they're doing, they'll be outside the cave.  No one who knows what they're doing goes in a cave.  It's just death waiting to happen.  They show somebody just barely at the top of this cave trying to breathe through this 
[01:18:00]  little air pocket.  Oh, right, right, right.  That would...  Yeah, fucked up.  And there's so many scenes like that that just look like, ah, it's sanctum.  So it's not a movie for you?  I'll see it, definitely.  I think I want to check it out too.  I don't know how they're going to make the story interesting.  And they're doing a Poseidon thing too, because all of a sudden...  What?  In the preview, they go, well, I'll see you on the other side.  So obviously they're going to have to do the big...  Oh, they're going to have to go under and over.  Obviously, something's wrong with their gear, I'm assuming, and they've got to hold their 
[01:18:30]  breath.  And of course, Fatso's going to fucking fuck it up for everybody.  Yeah, there's always one fatty that gets stuck in a cave.  Yeah, move.  And you're behind them.  Great.  How does the trailer look?  It looks really cool, but I don't know what the story is.  It's just people in a cave trying to survive.  He'll probably do a cool...  It'll probably be a cool 3D movie, though.  You look like you feel like you're falling in a cave and there's bats in you all over.  Hey, bats.  Oh, look out.  Whatever else is in a cave.  I haven't seen one 3D movie yet.  Really? 
[01:19:00]  I have not seen a one.  Well, I saw them in like Disney.  I saw Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.  Fucking jackass in 3D and you missed out, I'm telling you.  That made that movie way fucking better.  Oh, there's a little...  They actually go in there with equipment?  These rocks.  These caves.  Where else can you shine a light where no human's been?  Patty's Pussy.  You are out there with a time to explore. 
[01:19:30]  Elepids.  It is the last unexplored territory in the world.  It's a big fucking hole.  It's a big fucking hole.  The mother of all caves.  Trust me, you're gonna love this.  What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?  Some come for fame and fortune.  You're not gonna set any records without me.  Oh, God.  The act is horrible.  Others to chase history.  Your old man is the most respected explorer in the world.  Because he's got nothing else.  He's a good kid, Frank.  You need to go easy on him.  That's exactly what I don't need to do. 
[01:20:00]  I will kill you in a heartbeat.  But one mistake in Earth's inner sanctum.  My God.  Would you look at that?  And no one will ever know.  You are even here.  Whoa.  Water.  Get him around.  What the hell was that?  Pull the team out now.  The storm has turned into a cyclist.  Dad, the cave is bloody.  Do you think?  You're gonna find another way out.  We're heading back down.  I can't do this. 
[01:20:30]  I'm not a diving.  You can do this because you have to do this.  I don't want to die down here.  I gotta get out of here, aren't I?  We follow the river all the way to the ocean.  Yeah.  This way.  All the way out of the ocean.  That was flat again.  Nope.  I'll see you on the other side.  Could have picked a better choice of words.  Give me a hand.  Oh, no.  We're going to find another way out.  Running out of time.  Might be a cool 3D movie, though.  Yeah.  But this is the Poseidon adventure. 
[01:21:00]  Completely.  Only the boat's made out of rock.  Right.  Exactly.  Just stupid.  And now they're underwater.  Look at this guy's running out of air.  No matter what happens, you never, ever give up.  Oh, man.  That's claustrophobic.  I gotta breathe.  Obviously a visual.  I'm sorry.  I sucked up the last bit of air.  I had that happen one time.  I went into a cave with my friends.  It was like that.  Yeah.  I had to get out. 
[01:21:30]  It's just boom.  You know.  Exploring.  Climbing.  Climbing and exploring?  Yes.  Crazy.  We were like, Chip, where are we going to go?  I'm going to just shut up.  No fucking way.  Roland says he pitched this months ago and offered screeners, but he said no.  Roland must have pitched it as a rom-com.  Yeah.  Shut up.  We would take a fucking cave diving fucking Tahrir shit movie.  Walk down the hall right now with my screener.  I'll fucking watch that shit.  Can I?  I want it in 3D.  Yeah.  I don't want to see it in not 3D.  No, I don't care.  I got a 65 on TV. 
[01:22:00]  It's good enough.  I'll see it not in 3D.  It looks like The Abyss meets The Poseidon Adventure.  Let's roll it.  I can email everybody if he wants to see it.  There is no way.  Do you have an actual copy?  I could have got it, but nobody responded to me.  I responded to him.  Go get him.  What?  What?  Go get him, and then we'll have some of these actors in.  Okay.  Because they're all nobodies.  Trying to make it in Hollywood with the Sankta movie.  If you would have explained that that was the movie.  I put James Cameron's Spectrum.  Who cares James Cameron?  It's not a-  I hated Avatar.  And thank you.  It's not a James Cameron movie.  They're using his 3D technology that he invented for Avatar, so they had to slap a producer 
[01:22:30]  credit on it.  Yeah.  So he doesn't really have much to do with this movie.  But he gets the money.  That's what I'm hearing.  I'm not sure if that's true.  Yeah, he gets some cake.  Oh, he didn't direct it.  Thanks, Adam.  But his crew, though.  But how did you describe the movie?  I said by the skewed, I put the links and everything on there.  So you guys can see.  A link schminx.  I don't like links.  I need a good slug line at the beginning.  What did you write?  Your email was like, James Cameron, produce, and then I snoozed out.  I said, in the world of darkness. 
[01:23:00]  He's actually recorded a trailer.  Because I would have watched that.  I'll get that one.  Okay.  I'll go email that.  I don't see it in my old emails, but I'm sure you did send that.  Yeah, we want to see that.  Absolutely.  Hey, Oscar in Cleveland can tell us about, it's called the Swallows.  Not Swallows.  Swallows, Oscar?  Where are you, fuck?  Oscar.  Oscar, what's up?  Oscar.  Oscar.  It's the cave of the Swallows in Mexico.  Swallows, okay. 
[01:23:30]  They do face jumping trips there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every year.  So we know that much about it.  That's what Jimmy said, and he's never been there.  How deep is it?  Like 800 feet or 750 something.  Okay.  It's about 300 feet wide at the bottom.  Ooh.  That's big.  Can you imagine jumping into a hole like that?  How do people get out?  They use a gas-powered winch to haul people up.  Oh.  Or some water.  There's no underground rivers or anything else down there.  Oh, there's no rivers or anything? 
[01:24:00]  No, that's something they did for the movie.  Is there other caves down there, though?  I don't believe so.  It's just a bunch of rocks, and there's about a 30 by 30 landing area where you can land a parachute.  And it's just a big hole that people jump into?  What assholes?  It's like a manhole.  Guess it's the ultimate thrill, like jumping off of a tower at night.  Yeah, I've seen some specials on this place, and it looks unbelievable.  How many people have smashed into the wall?  I'm sure a few.  I'm sure. 
[01:24:30]  It happens.  What happens?  If your chute doesn't open, you're in trouble, right?  What do you think?  Yeah, well, if your chute doesn't open anywhere, you're in trouble.  I'd say no.  I think it's fine.  Yeah, I think it's fine.  You'll be fine.  The rocks are very soft in that area.  Yes, cushy.  Very cushy.  The base jumping canopies are really reliable, and they open really fast.  Would you ever base jump?  No.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I've seen footage of one not opening.  Guy jumped off a bridge, and he threw up his thing, and it was like...  Flutter, flutter.  And boy, did he make a splash-a-roo, and the fucking guy's like, I hope he's all right, 
[01:25:00]  and it was real, and he jumped after him.  Were you here when we showed the video of the guy jumping out of the plane without a parachute?  Yes, I've seen that.  And he did it on purpose.  It was, you know...  It's crazy.  They're daredevils, and the guy's like, well, watch what we could do as a group.  And the guy jumps out of the plane without a fucking parachute.  Then a few seconds later, a couple other guys jump out, and before they hit the ground,  they put a parachute on the guy, no big deal, and he lands safely.  Get the fuck out of here.  But to jump out of a plane with no parachute on, regardless of what they tell me is going 
[01:25:30]  to happen afterwards.  Right.  I can't even play that game of trust where you go, okay, trust, and you fall backwards  into your group.  Okay, trust.  The group makes you trust the people that...  Oh, yeah.  I can't even do that.  If this guy's, like, trusting these fucking assholes, they just wave to him, bye.  Right, fuck you, we hated you.  From the plane, the plane turns.  He just watches the plane flying away, and he's like, ah, you motherfuckers got me.  Yeah, it was just a big joke.  It was like he was punked for real.  That would suck. 
[01:26:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Uh, oh, Tracy Morgan, that's right.  Tracy Morgan.  We were leaning to Tracy Morgan.  There was a big basketball game in New York yesterday.  The Knicks versus the Heat.  Fucking A, you know.  And the Knicks won.  Fucking A, you know.  Ah, because I heard it driving in this morning.  Well, Bosh is...  Not like I gave a flying fuck.  One of the top three is hurt, though.  Bosh is hurt, so...  Ah, Bosh is hurt?  Yeah, I told you.  So, uh...  Well, you know, one of the Knicks...  It's going to be the All-Star game.  First time in 17 years, I think.  That in Nick, he's been an All-Star? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  First time in 17...  What?  That's what I say.  That can't be possible.  I think it is.  First time in how many years?  17.  Nah.  Or nine.  Or seven.  Amari Stoudemire.  Yes.  He's the first Knick in an All-Star game since Patrick Ewing in 1992.  Ah, see.  92 is...  A basket.  They call me Tony Basketball.  They call me Tony Basketball.  They haven't had a Knick in the All-Star game in almost 20 years?  Oh, a Knick.  Or the last Knick to start an All-Star game. 
[01:27:00]  So maybe there was one...  Start, yeah.  ...that was like a reserve.  Because they try to throw one from every team, unless it's hockey.  Oh, try to get me.  And they don't acknowledge that the Islanders have any players that are All-Star material.  It's better that way.  No Islanders in the NHL All-Star game going on this weekend.  Or in a couple days, whenever the fuck that is.  But Tracy Mooring was at the game.  He's the only one who can send it.  I guess with the...  You know, they did the courtside interview.  Courtside, the celebrity.  Hey, we got Tracy Morgan here.  Yeah, the audio is just okay, so listen closely.  He's the only one who can send it. 
[01:27:30]  Shoot.  Tina Fey or Sarah Palin?  He can't get fired, man.  No, I'm just telling you.  Listen, both of them...  Let me ask you one question.  Sarah Palin's good looking, isn't she?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Thank you.  Tina Fey's good looking.  Yo, let me tell you something about Sarah Palin, man.  That's just good masturbation material.  Oh!  Glasses and all of that.  Great masturbation material.  Hey!  What do I...  What do I thank Tracy Morgan for stopping by? 
[01:28:00]  I'd like Tracy Morgan for stopping by.  Come on, come on, come on.  They're panicking.  Come on, come on, come on.  I love how they were being fake edgy, like with Tracy Morgan.  Like, come on, let's have a little fun here.  And Tracy's like, all right, I'll show you some fucking fun.  And then they're like, whoa!  I'm going to do some Tracy Morgan stuff.  Right, who was that?  I don't care.  Was that Barkley?  Yeah.  That's one time I can actually understand why they were nervous.  Yes, because you know that's going to catch some shit.  You're talking about the vice presidential candidate being good masturbation material.  She's just a fucking...  She's a joke at this point. 
[01:28:30]  She's a Tinder box, though, if you say anything about her.  Right.  Like, someone is going to fucking say shit.  What network was that?  TNT.  Oh, okay.  Here it is.  The apology.  It had to happen.  It's unfortunate Mr. Morgan showed a lack of judgment.  Wait, wait, wait.  Who's apologizing?  TNT.  They kind of have to.  It's unfortunate Mr. Morgan showed a lack of judgment on our air with his inappropriate  comments that Turner spoke in Jeff Pomeroy or something like that in a statement.  Did Tracy apologize?  He ain't apologizing.  I don't apologize for nothing. 
[01:29:00]  You know what you're getting if you have Tracy Morgan on live TV.  Yeah.  Then don't go there.  First of all, you're kind of stupid for having Tracy on live.  He's going to say something.  He's going to fucking say something.  I don't think it's that big of a deal.  No.  Well, the thing is, it's not that big of a deal, really.  But it's a perceived big deal.  With who, though?  With people that love Sarah Palin because they look for people that say bad things about  her and then make a big fucking thing about it. 
[01:29:30]  Now they'll raise the point, which I would raise, too.  Like, what if it was, let's say it was another comic and he's like Nick DiPaolo and he was  saying about how Michelle Obama is great masturbation material.  Just look up there.  Oh, boy.  That's a nice ass.  Racism.  Let's see.  Shit.  Oh, my God.  I always wonder if some people are watching the same channels we're watching and then when  stuff comes on, they hear us laugh and know we can't talk about it, but they know what 
[01:30:00]  the joke is.  Fucking Cairo's a mess, man.  It sure is.  Holy shit.  This is supposed to be the biggest demonstration yet today.  All over a pyramid?  Yeah.  They want to turn it upside down on the pointy edge.  But people say, that ain't going to work.  You can't do that.  And other people say, yes, yeah, we can make it work.  So we get to Charlie Sheen, rushed to a hospital for severe abdominal pains after partying with 
[01:30:30]  five women.  So supposedly he was on a 36-hour bender.  TMZ reporting that he had a briefcase of cocaine delivered to his house, meaning just  bricks.  TMZ is pretty accurate.  So if they're running with the fact that it was a briefcase full of cocaine, then it's  got to be close to the true.  How fucked up is this guy?  It's amazing.  And how many years has he been fucked up and able to hold a fucking gig?  I think the problem is, though, he's dumb because eventually he's just going to die. 
[01:31:00]  It's like, you've got a great career, man.  Like, he has a great...  For a while, he didn't do much.  And then he got this show, and it's a fucking massive hit.  And he's the king of the network.  It's like, dude, just don't do fucking blow all night for three nights.  There was a rumor that CBS stock dropped yesterday when this news hit.  Really?  I don't know if it's true.  I did read that.  Yes, Sam?  I was going to ask Travis a question. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  Yes, Sam?  You know we're broadcasting.  It's a secret, though.  You guys can't know.  We're not broadcasting, though.  Hey, well, yeah.  I know.  That's why I wasn't going to...  We're broadcasting.  What's the question?  It was show-related.  It's probably going to be, hey, Travis, are you a queer?  I am.  All right.  Awkwardly ask him.  Go ahead.  On the air?  Yes.  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know the bit, Stalker Patty, intercourse with Jim Norton?  Yeah.  What is that?  I think that's when Jim pretended to have sex with Stalker Patty.  I think she might have been hypnotized. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, is that what that was?  I think.  Eric?  Yeah, we hypnotized her into having her first real orgasm.  Yeah.  Oh, I remember.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  This is the kind of fascinating stuff that goes on behind the scenes, right?  Unbelievable.  Why did you need to ask that question?  Behind the scenes.  Because we're putting together our next Worst of special, set of specials, and I need  to write down some things for certain people to voice.  Oh, I have a question.  Yes.  For Sam. 
[01:32:30]  What's that?  Where's my fucking apple pie?  Oh.  Ooh.  And my key lime pie.  That is true.  What the fuck happened with fucking Bobby?  Bobby, your lovely mommy, was supposed to bake us some pies because she's such a...  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  The jokes.  Oh, God.  The jokes.  That is fucked up, though.  Wow.  How is that possible?  Here's what we're looking at.  There's a silverback gorilla, and he walks like a man upright in Kent in the UK. 
[01:33:00]  What the fuck was that?  Look, he stands up, and he's just like...  Look at his big pot belly.  That is fucked up.  My finger's on the dump button, by the way.  Do you know how bad that...  For me.  Do you know how bad that fucking thing could smash you if you were just walking...  Look at it.  It's just walking like...  Walks across the lawn or whatever.  It's walking like on its highway, and I know...  It stands up near the gate.  They occasionally stand up and do some shit, and maybe take a couple of steps.  It's almost like a chicken flying. 
[01:33:30]  Like, they could get a little bit.  But this thing is walking around like...  Like, it's nothing.  Silverback gorillas are fucking powerful animals, man.  Just like...  Like, if you got in a fight with one, you would...  So...  You'd try, but you'd realize instantly that there's nothing you could do to this thing.  I'd rather fight a silverback than a fucking chimp, because chimps, to me...  Chimps are squirreling.  They're much more vicious.  They bite your balls off.  They bite your fingers off.  They do.  That's what they do.  They go for you.  They bite your balls. 
[01:34:00]  I don't know.  They're horrible animals.  I don't think there's been as many gorilla attacks as there have been chimp attacks.  Exactly.  Because people have chimps in their house, and gorillas, there haven't been that many  around.  Like, people don't have pet gorillas.  But I think a gorilla more would smash you.  Not allowed.  Yeah, yeah.  A gorilla would fucking...  But a gorilla would smash you and fuck...  I think a gorilla could do so much more damage than a chimp.  But a chimp bites and gouges your eyes.  Like, they're fucking...  And leaves you alive all fucked up.  They're dirty fighters.  They bite your nose off.  I think Jimmy's onto something. 
[01:34:30]  I think a silverback would kill you quickly, where it wouldn't hurt as much.  Yeah.  Fucking, uh...  Yeah.  A chimp just picks you apart and eats your balls.  Exactly.  They love eating your balls.  You're alive while he's munching on your fucking ball bag.  That removes your ability to fucking appropriate.  After your eyes are removed.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the ultimate fucking defeat.  Yeah, that's the fuck you.  And they fucking, uh...  And I think with a chimp, you could...  With a gorilla, you could probably play docile, and it would work better.  What's up with the silverback walking, though?  That is fucked up, man.  That's gotta be really rare, right?  Yeah.  I would say... 
[01:35:00]  I never saw it walk that far.  I want to pet one.  That's for sure.  I want to pet a big silverback.  No, you don't.  I would love to.  Chimp would scare me more than a big silverback.  Hold on.  I just gotta get this out of my system.  And then...  There.  Thank you.  Uh, we got Bobby on the phone.  Sam's mom.  Bobby.  Jesus.  Hey, how are ya? 
[01:35:30]  Well, hi, Bobby.  Anne's got a question for you today.  Bobby?  Yeah?  Hi, I hope you're having a good day, and the snow wasn't too inconvenient for you.  Oh, thank you.  I'm so glad you care.  No, I really do.  I'm the...  I'm the nice one.  I'm trying to bribe her a little more for the...  Uh, is there any way, because I know your baking prowess is second to none, uh, is there  any way you can make me an apple pie?  What are you talking...  Where is Anthony's apple pie? 
[01:36:00]  Why are you asking again?  She only said she was gonna bake an apple pie.  Back off.  Back off.  All right, sorry.  Is there any way I could get an apple pie baked by you?  Because I heard they're really good.  I absolutely can bake you an apple pie.  Let me tell you this little thing.  You know, we talked about this before.  So I went out to the store, and I was looking for the right ingredients.  And you know what the holdup has been?  Because I believe it was Opie asking for a key lime pie.  Yes.  I'm holding up the baking, Bobby. 
[01:36:30]  Yes, you are.  Well, I was gonna bake them.  Maybe your lunch date is.  I can't find key limes right now.  Oh, see, key limes.  That's why I didn't bring it in, because I didn't think it would be fair.  Also, my mom had a concern.  What?  She said that the pies that she makes, she wants them to be served fresh and doesn't  like the idea of me bringing the pies in a day later.  Well...  Don't tell her to get up at two in the morning.  No, she can't do that.  It's okay, because I think...  It's true.  ...not enough time will go by to do anything to the pie. 
[01:37:00]  I mean...  Yeah, you're not gonna leave it on top of the car overnight.  You're just gonna bring it in the next morning.  Now, I understand the problem with the key limes, but are there apples and stuff?  Because I really would...  I mean, I don't think Opie would mind if you made my pie, and I got the apple pie.  Can I pick another pie?  Does Opie say that?  Is it alright with...  Bobby, can I pick another pie?  Can you make a...  Oh, he's picking another pie.  Can you make like a chocolate pudding pie?  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  With whipped cream on top?  That's not one of her specialties.  Oh, what's your specialties?  Let's hear it.  I like...  I do pecan pie.  Boo.  Hey, pecan pie.  Oh, no, with vanilla ice cream.  Hey, pecan pie.  She serves it.  Of course it is.  Do you make a good rhubarb?  Pecan pie rules.  Strawberry rhubarb pie would be terrific.  It is good.  I like a rhubarb.  That would be terrific, Bob.  I never ate rhubarb pie, nor will I ever.  I hate the name, but I love it.  Strawberry rhubarb.  It reminds me of rebar, which is much different than rhubarb.  Wait, we did the strawberry rhubarb thing. 
[01:38:00]  We brought a piece in.  It was unbelievable.  You have to try it.  You wouldn't love it.  I don't know.  I don't believe in strawberry rhubarb.  Those two together.  I don't know what it does.  It exists.  Bobby, what's the deal with strawberries and rhubarb?  Why do they go well together?  I don't know, because I'm not a big fan of rhubarb.  She's not a rhubarb fan.  Whoa.  Not a rhubarb fan.  I don't like the pecan pie, though.  We got a problem here.  Anthony's got his apple pie.  Pie wars.  I got...  How about...  All right.  How about a fresh lemon meringue?  I can do that, sure.  Wow.  Lemon meringue.  Now, that takes a little bit more work, doesn't it? 
[01:38:30]  Well, a little bit, but that's okay.  Do you hand whip your meringue?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the only way to do it, really.  Of course.  Folding in the sugar.  I don't want lemon meringue.  You must fold it in.  If you whip it and stir it, it'll shrink down and turn liquid.  How do you know this?  I bake all the time.  It's one of my secret hidden hobbies.  Do you make good carrot cake?  I like carrot cake icing a lot.  Why do you like crappy cakes?  Yeah, you make carrot cake rules.  You and your pecan, and your freaking carrot cake. 
[01:39:00]  Carrot cake rules.  Apple pie is sweet and nice and cinnamon.  If you have a piece of Morton's, honestly, carrot cake, it could be one of the five greatest  things ever.  Nope.  It's giant.  It's giant cake.  Bobby, I got it.  Peach cobbler.  Yuck.  Peach is good.  Are peaches in season?  No, they're not.  It's not 1840.  Could you make me a mint julep while my slaves do the work outside, too?  Could you preserve some prunes for me in a mason jar?  Yeah.  May I make an observation?  Yes.  At least our pies are made out of a fucking fruit. 
[01:39:30]  Watch your language.  Bobby's on the phone.  Oh, sorry, Bobby.  I apologize.  When you said peach cobbler just now, a certain producer in the other room.  Involuntary grown?  Just jumped up and threw his arms up in the air.  You like peach cobbler?  Hold on.  Peach cobbler.  Hold on.  I got...  Our guest today is the very obese and clumsy Eric Nagel.  Eric, please tell the audience what you did wrong now.  It's Jerry Springer.  Jerry!  Jerry! 
[01:40:00]  Jerry!  No, Frankenberry hair.  What do you...  That haircut is horrendous.  It's called hat head.  Hat head?  Jesus.  It's called hairpiece head.  Hat head.  Really?  Hot belly.  I never understood why he looks like he has a hairpiece and he doesn't...  He's got a great head of hair on him, that kid.  He has all his own hair, but it looks like he's wearing a hairpiece.  Bizarre.  He reacts to cake and pie like Oliver Twist.  Please, sir, can I have 20 more?  So you like cobbler E-Rock served how? 
[01:40:30]  It was a little vanilla ice cream.  How's your diet going, honestly?  Is your diet going okay?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Which means non-existent.  Exactly.  E-Rock and me went out to lunch the other day.  Oh, what do we have?  Remember where we went?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We went to Wendy's.  Wendy's again.  Wendy's again.  That's great.  All right, we've got to figure out the pies where everyone is happy.  Cherry pie is good.  I'm allergic to cherries, Bobby.  Don't you dare.  How about cheesecake?  Cheesecake.  Cheesecake's good, but you could get good cheesecake in New York, like in a lot of places. 
[01:41:00]  I want fresh apple pie.  That's something you just don't think she can make.  Just say it.  You don't think she can make good cheesecake.  No, no, no.  I know she can.  I have the utmost faith.  I have the utmost faith that you will make the greatest apple pie.  Our goal is to take out Martha Stewart with Sam's mom, Bobby.  You laugh, Bobby, but...  She probably should have her own show here on...  Channel.  ...XM Satellite Radio.  She sure should.  Her own channel.  What other pies do you make?  I'm not...  No to the peak, Han. 
[01:41:30]  Bobby 203.  I do.  I do pumpkin pie.  I like pumpkin pie with whipped cream.  It's not Halloween.  Pumpkin pie is pretty good stuff.  I'll give you that.  Yeah.  But it is seasonal.  Yeah.  Can you make...  Here's what I would like.  Can you make a pie?  It's going to be like...  Kind of like a fruit pie or a fruitcake, but with Sam's hair in it.  I want Sam's old hair in a pie.  Sam's hair pie?  Wait a minute.  No, it's got little strands of it sticking out.  So it looks alive and gelatinous. 
[01:42:00]  How about banana pudding?  Yeah.  Ah.  Banana pudding.  Banana cream pie.  Banana cream pie.  Banana pudding.  Oh, I can do you guys the banana pudding.  But you know what?  You guys, I might have to come into the studio and bake because I...  Oh, how great would that be?  The lawyers wouldn't allow it.  She wants to.  You could tell the way she does.  Yeah.  She wants to.  Tell the fucking lawyers to green light this fucking...  Blue sky, whatever the hell they call it.  Green light.  Throw it in the bucket of things we could do.  They would...  Get this done.  I want Bobby baking on our show one morning as we're telling dick jokes.  There's no ovens here. 
[01:42:30]  Hot plate.  A hot plate.  Bobby can't be with two hands tied behind her back while she's baking.  How does Martha make her horse shit?  She does it in a TV studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's here.  She's a...  Never seen her.  Bobby?  Yeah?  Yeah.  About the apple pie?  Yeah.  Just a ballpark about when I would be getting this.  Ballpark.  Like next week?  Yeah, I can do that next week.  Early next week?  Yeah, I can do it early next week. 
[01:43:00]  Like Monday-ish?  Ish.  Because I'm really so psyched.  Martha Stewart has cooking shit in her studio right now.  No, she doesn't.  I swear to God.  There is no way there's an oven in her studio.  Travis, talk to the guys and say, we want Bobby to come in and bake an apple pie for us.  Troy's going to look right now.  I wouldn't trust them.  They might, you know, like play a trick or something and mess up.  That a boy, Bobby.  Never trust them.  Never trust them. 
[01:43:30]  You're right.  People always ask my mom for recipes and she gives them the wrong recipes.  Like she screws up ingredients.  Ah, that's cool.  You know what?  That is so not true.  Although both Sam and his dad claim that that is not true.  She's like a little too much salt.  She's very defensive.  I mean, the cookies never taste the same.  It's like, oh boy, Bobby's come out so good.  Yeah, they're just a little different.  I just can't get it right.  Yes, I'm just not a baker.  Troy?  And then Bobby turns to an imaginary camera and winks.  Who are you winking at, Mom? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, you know.  Troy, what do you got?  They cook over there all the time.  What?  What?  The hallway smells all the time like food.  When are we going to get some of that food?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  E-Rock's lunch.  That's just E-Rock's coat right now.  Yeah, I mean, I don't see why it would be a problem.  Well, fuck, we got to make friends with the Martha Stewart broads.  Oh, good luck doing that.  Yeah.  I think I'd talk to one of them.  Yeah?  I think.  You'd think.  They're weird.  Kenny tries to talk to them all the time and they just put their head down.  Well, that's Kenny.  Exactly.  They're totally normal.  I think he ruined it for everybody over here.  How would you feel if the Loch Ness Monster just started chatting with you out of water? 
[01:44:30]  That standing silver bag starts talking.  Hi.  You thought it was a statue until it spoke?  Yeah, when they're cooking stuff, I'll let you guys know.  We got to make friends with them.  We want to taste their goods.  Yeah.  All right, Bobby, you figure it out.  It's an apple pie, whatever you want to make.  You figure it out.  Yeah, Bobby, just keep me in mind.  Apple pie.  I could probably do it for Monday.  That would be great. 
[01:45:00]  We're only celebrating my sister's birthday on Sunday, so there's not too much going on.  That's okay.  It's an apple pie.  Throw it together.  You don't even have to do your best at it.  I know your worst apple pie is everyone else's best.  And what did you say?  Sister's birthday?  Yeah.  Even Bobby knows she's the third favorite.  Oh, it's not like Sam.  If it was Sam's birthday, then there'd be a major problem getting the pie house on Monday.  Sam has what's called birth week, I bet.  Right.  It's birth week, and it's like a whole thing that leads up to your birthday.  And Sam's sister gets an hour, and then they go back to worshiping Sam.  They don't even remember. 
[01:45:30]  Nah.  It's like, what?  How many candles on this thing?  Yeah.  We don't even know.  She doesn't like as many fun things to celebrate like you.  Yeah.  I like fun things, so it's fun.  Bobby, do you wish that you only had one child and his name was Sam at this point?  No, I wish no such thing.  She wishes you had three children all like Sam.  You wish I had triplets that day.  Imagine three Sam's.  Three Sam's.  I rule.  You might make big trouble for me with this stuff, you know.  I know.  Yeah.  We know it's true.  It's okay.  But you know, I want to know something. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, I don't know why you guys wouldn't have the Martha Stewart people running over with  food for you all the time.  I mean, you guys could charm the pants off anybody.  Whoa.  Watch out, Bobby.  Thank you so much.  It's all about you, Bobby, though.  We're back in Bobby.  We're Team Bobby, not Team Martha.  What has she done in her career?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Just ripping off other people's recipes and putting it on TV.  Has she produced a Sam in her career?  That's right.  Oh, my God.  Exactly. 
[01:46:30]  No, absolutely not.  No one has.  Only you.  All right, Bobby.  I made such a sweet boy.  Safe to say you're going to be staying up all night Sunday so the pie's nice and fresh  when Sam picks it up in the morning.  Yeah, that's probably what I'll do.  How else do you think it's getting here, Sam?  I thought I'd pick it up in the evening.  No.  She doesn't want her pie to be too old.  So she's going to stay up all night, and you're going to get there around four and pick  it up.  Oh.  Right, Bobby?  That's how it's going to work?  I think so.  I think so.  We're making moms stay up all night to bake an apple pie. 
[01:47:00]  Bobby, whenever you have the time, and again, apple for me, Anthony, I would definitely  appreciate it.  Because, and it really is just a tribute to you, this whole thing.  I could go out and, look, I'm a wealthy guy.  I truly could go out and buy an apple pie.  You could buy two.  I could probably buy two.  You could buy the goddamn bakery.  I probably could.  But I know that yours will be of a caliber I could not purchase. 
[01:47:30]  This is something money can't buy.  She makes the crush from scratch.  Yes.  Damn.  Exactly.  That's what I mean.  Well, I appreciate all those nice words.  That's really, really nice of you.  I cannot wait.  Why don't we hang up on Bobby before it gets ugly?  All right, Bobby.  Let's keep it all nice today.  Let's keep it all nice.  Have a great day.  Have a great day and a great weekend.  Thank you very much.  And cut some fresh flowers for Monday, too, so this place smells nice.  I'll do what I can do.  Some fresh flowers.  Whatever's in season. 
[01:48:00]  Whatever you can find out there.  I don't know what's in season.  Want to make a potpourri?  Yeah, a little potpourri for the studio.  Yeah, some kind of centerpiece.  A centerpiece for our pie.  Yeah, let's dress this up a little bit and make it a thing instead of just an apple pie.  All right?  Let's make a whole Martha Stewart thing on Monday.  She does like to decorate.  All right, good.  I'll keep it all in mind, guys.  All right, you got a lot of work ahead of you, Bobby.  Bobby, thank you so much.  All right, there's Sam's mom, Bobby.  There she goes.  Okay, it's a pleasure, guys.  Good day, madam.  God, I love your mom.  She's great. 
[01:48:30]  I was trying the Eddie Haskell approach from Beaver to Beaver, where you're just nice and  everything.  And not that I have any reason to not be nice.  Right.  But, you know.  But then you get a pie out of the deal.  You get more pie with sugar than you do horse shit.  You know what, though?  Oh, I get it.  See?  She said you could charm the pants off of anybody.  Oh.  I think you know what that means.  Yeah, it was getting weird.  Oh, my.  That was.  Was that weird for you to hear?  Yeah, and then Obie was like, we're on Team Bobby.  And it's like, now it's getting flirty.  It's getting weird.  Yeah, that was odd. 
[01:49:00]  What?  The whole thing got weird.  Ah, I just want a mother figure in my life.  That's all.  I know.  I don't want to have sex with your mom.  Hey.  Okay.  Well, I really don't.  I just want a mother figure.  I want to suckle a little bit.  Suckle?  Suckle a little bit.  The breastfeeding thing again?  Just a warm boob on my cheek would be nice.  I know.  I know.  You want your little head held.  Yeah, my little head held against your mom's pussy.  While your tummy gets rubbed and perhaps a little lower.  Oh, God.  While you get your tummy and legs rubbed.  Just because she's not on the phone anymore doesn't mean she can't hear.  Exactly.  We're on the radio.  I want to make it perfectly clear I don't want to have sex with your mom, Sam. 
[01:49:30]  That's sick.  Well, now you're being rude about it.  That's insulting.  It's a motherly stuff.  Yeah, you're being very rude about it.  She's a very attractive woman.  Thank you.  Yeah, but I respect Sam's father and his handlebar mustache.  Thank you for the respect.  I respect your dad and you, Sam.  I appreciate that.  Bobby Lee is here, so let's take a quick break.  We're going to get Bobby Lee in here.  We're going to talk about Charlie Sheen and the porn star she's talking, Casey Jordan.  She had a little party with Charlie Sheen the night before he was rushed to the hospital,  so we got a few clips from her. 
[01:50:00]  Rumor has it Brie Olsen was in the house, too.  We know Brie pretty well.  Haven't seen her in a while, but she's done the show.  Some know her more than others.  Sure.  And then later on, we got Vinny and his uncle.  Later on, real soon, Vinny and his uncle from Jersey Shore.  That's right.  Uncle Nino.  Yeah.  If you're a fan of the show, he was on one episode, I think, last season, right?  Miami?  Yeah, Miami.  And he was the star of the show.  He loved JWoww.  He is a mess.  You can't understand him, so we'll have fun with him.  And then you got Russell Peters, one of the biggest comics in the world, and also Brooke Shields. 
[01:50:30]  Very busy day.  Yes.  And we played that because Lady Gaga's in the news.  Is she?  Ugh.  She's got a new perfume she wants to make, and she wants it to smell like blood and semen.  Yeah.  Because she's different.  I'll give her my sheets.  And with that, we say hi to Bobby Lee. 
[01:51:00]  Hello, Bobby.  Hello.  I tip my hat to Jim Norton, who was very close to coming out with something.  No, I just, I like yours.  I Twittered yesterday, but I like yours better.  Oh, you did, please.  She wants it to smell like blood and semen.  In other words, her underwear.  I actually prefer yours.  I'll give her my sheets as fire.  I hooked up with this girl once, and her Nana, can I say it?  The Nana smelled like hot blood.  Hot blood.  Like, it was not just blood, but it was, like, heated, like, you know what I mean, that you  would see in the first 48. 
[01:51:30]  Fresh.  Like, curdled.  Like, curdled blood.  You know what I mean?  I still did it anyway, you know, because I'm a warrior.  I can't fucking check on the rag, man.  You can do that?  I can't do that.  Oh, I can do all that.  I can do that.  I'm a warrior.  All the time.  All the time.  Get right in there.  Yeah.  I watch all kinds of porn now, too.  It's like, you know how, like, over the years.  I thought you were trying to avoid all that stuff.  No, I'm back in it.  I'm back in it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I'm back in it.  Thank God.  Because, you know, I'm 40, and, you know, I'm about to die anyway, you know what I mean?  So might as well go for it.  Never know.  You're over the hump.  Yeah.  You said, fuck it.  Well, you know how, I used to do crystal meth when I was younger. 
[01:52:00]  I'm sober now.  You know that, right?  Yes.  And when you masturbate while you're on crystal meth, you can't think of just breasts.  You have to think of crazy stuff.  You know what I mean?  And that's where I'm at now on my porn.  You know what I mean?  The crazier the better.  The crazier the better, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't just look at a naked picture and jerk off.  No, like, you know Japanese porn?  Oh, my God.  That's the past.  They're fucking crazy.  Because the men are aggressive, right?  They're, you know what I mean?  They make the noises, and the girls are crying.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know why. 
[01:52:30]  I don't know why.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And that makes me, you know what I mean?  Like, make me feel good.  Makes you cum real hard.  It makes me cum real hard.  I could never fucking get into that shit.  I've watched it, and it's like, anime porn.  I like that, too.  I like that.  The guy's like, oh, do you know what I mean?  And he's got this glowing yellow dick for some reason.  And sometimes an octopus will come out and, like, make love to nine girls at the same time.  You know what I mean?  That's fucking awesome.  And they're all going like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like that.  They're in the little schoolgirl thing. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, schoolgirl, yeah.  And they like that.  Yeah.  I like that noise.  I like that noise.  With animated tears.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're crying.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  They always cry.  It's because they got nuked.  I'm telling you.  It's a culture that has their balls cut off, and they want to fucking reclaim their masculinity  and their strength as a culture.  Yes, Germany's the same way.  They're bizarre in their porn.  You think because of that, though, when you lose a world war, is this something you're  into?  Well, that's a little too much.  That's real. 
[01:53:30]  Is this something you're into?  That's not a cartoon.  That's a little too much.  That's a little too much.  Danny, can you explain what you're looking at?  No.  No.  What is that?  I love it.  Danny just goes, no.  You can't explain it.  It's live-action tentacle porn, basically.  Who wants to fuck a tentacle?  I don't know.  It's chasing women through the hallway.  Is this an actual category?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is this a category tentacle porn?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That's my mom.  This looks great, though.  This looks great, though.  This is like anime.  Look. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, my God.  But they pixelate the pussy.  The pussy.  I don't know why.  Even though all this other crap is going on.  That's a little too much, I think, for me.  Can you show us something that you're really into right now?  That's crazy.  Maybe a video that really gets you off.  Well, no.  I mean, because the stuff that I have, I have it on DVD, because I'll tell you why.  You want to be able to destroy it as quickly as possible?  No, what is this?  What is this?  What's going on?  No, no.  I was just telling you I had to close the curtain, because we're watching.  Oh.  What happened?  Oh.  No, that's good.  What happened?  Whenever you do that, though, Jimmy, it makes me scared.  Oh, no.  No, because I remember the first time, so I don't want to say it.  Oh, yeah.  What happened? 
[01:54:30]  No, we're going to get it.  There's no tricks.  We're going to play this legit today for you, Bobby.  Okay, good, good.  Finally, we're going to have a normal appearance with Bobby Lee.  Yeah, everything's fine.  Everything's fine.  Everything's good so far.  No problem.  I'm here just till Monday.  Okay.  He's promoting Caroline's this weekend.  Two shows tonight, two shows Saturday.  Oh, and one show Sunday.  Nice.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4100.  The tickets should fucking sell real well for you.  Well, let's hope so.  Let's hope so.  Bobby Lee is hilarious.  Oh, thank you so much for saying that.  Show us something that you're really into as far as porn goes.  Or at least as a category.  Okay, the truth be known, okay? 
[01:55:00]  There's this college girl site that I have.  I have to have my iPad that I can direct it to through my email.  Because it's these college girls that submit, you know what I mean?  They're porn, and they get $5,000, right?  I just like it.  Let me tell you something.  I'm going to be real with you.  Be real.  All right, slow down.  Brie Olsen, is she coming in?  No.  No, no, no.  Because I just did a scene with her in a Pauly Shore Showtime thing, right?  That doesn't turn me on.  What turns me on is if it's a girl that's not in the business, but she has to do it. 
[01:55:30]  And in their eyes, you have to see them go, Mom.  You know what I mean?  Like that switch in their mind, like why?  You know what I mean?  Like I shouldn't be doing this.  I thought this was a good idea.  What road got me here?  Yeah.  And does that make me evil?  No.  No, that's kind of hot.  No, no.  I think it makes me evil.  No, you just get bored with the fucking same old thing.  Well, I have a girlfriend, so, you know, I love her.  Does she watch with you?  No, she doesn't like anything about that.  Does she know what you like?  No, I don't even.  I just don't even be saying that.  You know what's worse? 
[01:56:00]  What?  You ever watch that show, I Survived?  It's like a show.  It's on a, what channel is that?  A&E or Discovery or one of those fucking shows now that just show death, murder, crime shows.  And sometimes I get these women that were abducted or accosted in their homes.  I've seen that show.  And they're describing like this sexual abuse.  And I'm watching kind of going, I don't know why.  I'm not jerking off.  I'm not getting that hard on.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm going like, this is kind of hot.  Yeah, yeah.  And I feel like a real creep.  That's the kind of stuff I like. 
[01:56:30]  That it's hot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like it's so bad.  We're back to anime.  There's a movie called Irreversible.  Have you seen that?  No.  That rape scene is the worst scene ever.  Really?  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.  Oh, you like that?  It made me physically ill to watch that.  Oh, yeah.  It made me physically ill to watch that.  Although the rape scene in Clockwork Orange was pretty damn high.  That's nothing compared to Irreversible.  Oh, really?  It's a five-minute tunnel rape scene.  And it's so realistic.  You can't really jerk off to it.  It's so.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so realistic.  But you tried, right, Bobby? 
[01:57:00]  Yes, of course.  Really?  Yeah.  It's so fucking brutal.  I don't know this one.  And you feel so bad for the girl.  See, I don't like that.  Yeah, I don't like that.  Or the pinball machine in The Accused.  You can't jerk off to that either.  Nah.  Well, because she's not hot.  Oh, that's right.  It's Jodie Foster.  She likes women.  That's why you know.  You know what she likes.  It's an anime inside the vagina cum shot they just showed.  The big, giant green eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, those speed racer eyes.  Speed racer eyes.  Exactly.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's not a Japanese do.  I'll tell you that right now. 
[01:57:30]  That's the thing.  It's like these girls cry in these porns.  And it's like Japanese do.  They have small penises.  Yeah.  So what are they crying about?  Well, that's why they do the porn like that.  They're trying to make their cocks look bigger.  They want their cocks to have prowess.  They want to be these things that help make babies that no one is threatened by.  That's a lot of juice.  They're fans of giant breasts, too.  Giant breasts.  And then the women, in reality, have the smallest kiwi fruit titties.  Yeah, yeah.  But the anime, they're perfect, nice, big, perky.  Yeah.  I think it has to do with the nuclear thing that happened. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  So Jimmy's got a theory, man.  You have a theory.  I like Jimmy's theory.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, is he going to put it in her ass now?  Because they're really artsy, too.  And they have no military now, the Japanese.  Right, yeah.  They put all their energy into art, maybe.  Into art, and anime porn.  And leisure.  Tentacles, fucking women.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is he doing now?  Oh, my God.  Putting a band-aid on it.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Because he bruised it up real bad.  Yeah, it looked like he dug up a vagina with duct tape.  He put a band-aid.  That's really nice of him to do that, too, right?  When I bruise it up, I just leave it.  You know what I mean? 
[01:58:30]  Bobby's back in.  All the girls look the same in these.  Because we're trying to show you some stuff over the last couple years, and you're like,  eh.  And you run out of the studio.  Well, you showed me a guy, a human being, that was in the studio with his heart on,  and then you guys made me spit on his penis.  Oh, Bobo.  So that's a little weird.  That's Bobo.  Bobo?  That's the rape scene in Irreversible.  Yeah, that's it.  He's like, she's fucking her on her stomach.  I think I saw this.  He's got his hand over her mouth, but it's a brutal sodomizing.  That's five minutes.  Five minutes of that.  Yeah, I think I saw this movie.  It's brutal.  It's brutal.  That is fucked up.  It's brutal.  And what's he saying to her? 
[01:59:00]  I don't know.  It's in French.  But it's not good.  Makes it worse.  It's not good.  They don't even show the part where he gets up and kicks her in the face.  Oh, right.  He kicks her in the face.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How did I?  I can't even remember when or where I saw that, but I know I saw that movie.  You probably heard about a great rape scene and then went and done one.  Yeah, I got to get that.  I only saw this section.  I bought it and I just fast forward.  Just that and then fucking throw the movie away.  Bobby, what else is up with you?  It's been a while, man.  No, I was here like a couple of months ago.  That's a while.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  We've done probably 200 shows since you've been here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You've been to 200 shows?  My career is at a downward slope right now.  I did Harold and Kumar 3.  Did I talk about that last time?  No.  Yeah, downward.  No, it's a great.  I love John's show.  I love those guys.  You know what I mean?  It's a great art piece.  And then I had two lines in a movie called.  Oh, yeah.  We talked about Ken Jeong, where you should be Ken Jeong and you're not.  Right, but you know what?  Daddy's coming back a little bit, I think.  You know, I'm getting two lines again in movies.  Oh, okay.  I'm in a movie called Paul with Simon Pegg.  Oh, Simon Pegg.  And I know Chelsea every other week.  She saved my career, bro. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, I do it.  Yeah, she's great.  Chelsea Hamlin.  I'll tell you why.  Because she doesn't really think that I'm funny, I don't think.  I don't think she thinks a lot of people are funny.  But the thing is, is this, okay, when she came to the comedy store in the 90s, I was  like really nice to her because she was, I thought she was very funny.  And we were friends, you know what I mean?  And so she just helps out people, which is great, you know?  Oh.  A lot of people, they make it and they fuck you.  They fuck you, man.  They don't remember you.  They do, right?  Yeah, they fuck you, dude.  They don't even, they don't even return your phone calls or you see them and then they 
[02:00:30]  don't even like, you know what I mean?  What's up, bro?  And then they'll walk away.  Oh, the fake fist pump?  I mean, there was this one guy, there was this one guy, I'm not going to tell you to say  his name, but he's on a hit show right now on NBC, okay?  Look up NBC.  Is he a stand-up?  Look up NBC.  Is he a stand-up?  I know exactly who he's talking about.  No, you don't.  You do not.  No, I won't say it, but I do not.  But let me tell you something about this guy, okay?  The first day he moves into town, right, I'm with him and Bonnie McFarlane.  You know Bonnie.  Of course.  I'm friends with Bonnie.  Poor Bonnie.  We call him poor Bonnie.  Poor Bonnie, right? 
[02:01:00]  So, you know what, this kid comes to us.  Lost a bet, Bonnie.  He's young, right?  So I'm like, you know what?  Who is it?  I'm going to take him to a club.  So I got him to this club called LaDue, and then we went to Joseph's, which is at the  same, it was a really hot, you know what I mean, night.  You know, the doorman knows me.  And you're fucking showing, you know, you're the guy.  I'm showing him the LA guy night, right?  You're the man.  I'm a comic, you know what I mean?  Right, right.  So, you know, I buy him drinks, we dance, you know what I mean, do dancings, right?  And then, you know, next thing I know, six, seven months later, maybe a year, he's huge, 
[02:01:30]  you know?  And I saw him, you know, at a party.  He locked eyes.  He goes, it's you.  Gave me a pound.  I walked away.  You know what?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That's, I don't need that in my life.  Who is it?  I'm not going to tell you.  And you know.  Because I'm already on the outs with Hollywood.  I can't rat people out.  And remember what Patrice said the last time I was here?  I talk too much.  Yeah, he did say that.  Yeah, I talk too much.  Yeah, you got to watch what you say.  Yeah, you don't want to burn bridges like Patrice, though.  Oh, can I at least write it down?  Yeah, you write it down, and I'll say it. 
[02:02:00]  I'll say it.  If I got it?  He's young, but he's on a show.  I know exactly.  Okay, write it down.  Yep.  That's it right there.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see.  That's what I was thinking.  Let me see.  That's what I was thinking.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Yep.  I won't sit.  No.  Wow.  No, no, no, no.  Very close, though.  Very close.  He's younger.  Same show?  No.  He's younger.  He's younger.  Are you lying?  Joel McKeown.  I swear on my sobriety, I'm not lying.  And that's deep, bro.  No, it's not. 
[02:02:30]  See, people even hear who's saying that.  Everyone's saying the same thing.  It's not Joel McKeown.  It's not Joel McKeown.  It's not Joel McKeown.  I think he's a sweetheart.  He's Joel.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Different show.  Yeah.  You know what?  Forget it.  I don't even go to...  No, because...  Bye, bye.  At the end of this road...  At the end of this road, there's...  No, no, no, Bobby.  You didn't say...  In my life.  Bobby, you didn't say anything bad.  You just said...  At the end of this road, there's pain in my life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I know what you're going...  I'm not playing this game.  Let's move on.  Honestly, all you said was that he just gave you a fist pump at a party and you were annoyed.  That's fair.  Yeah.  That's fair.  You didn't trash him and say he sucked. 
[02:03:00]  You just said he gave you a fist pump.  No, he's a talented guy.  If we guess it, I swear I won't say it.  Okay, if you guess it, I'll tell you what it is.  Come on, fucking pal.  Okay.  You guys don't...  I'll give you another hint then.  Okay.  It's a hotter show than Community.  I know exactly.  And it's a remake.  It's a remake.  Oh, no.  It's a remake.  It's a remake.  Okay.  It's...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  So we got this.  So we got this.  He got... 
[02:03:30]  He got...  He got...  He got...  Is that it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He got it already.  He got the show.  We got the show.  Is this it?  No.  Not him?  No, no, no.  Okay, good.  He's not on that show.  I don't know the show.  Oh.  Is it...  No, no, no.  Is his first name...  Is his first name this?  No.  Oh.  Yeah, okay.  What?  What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  His first name is...  Lucky?  Anybody made the blowjob motion?  Lucky Magoo.  What?  Oh, wow. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Motherfucker.  But you know what, dude?  It was a...  You know...  Okay.  But can I say something?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  It was one night.  I'm not friends with him.  You know what I mean?  He wasn't on my top friends on MySpace.  Still not.  And let's move on.  But what I'm saying, though, is that...  Oh, okay.  How about a hug?  Right.  You know what I mean?  Daddy needs a hug sometimes.  You know what I mean?  How about a little more than a fist bump and a walk away?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about that?  But you know what?  Maybe I'm a guy who's...  Yes.  I have no idea who he is.  Yeah.  Maybe I'm a guy who's just jealous and I live in this like... 
[02:04:30]  You know, I'm like a ronin.  You know what a ronin is?  You know what a ronin is?  A ronin?  You don't know what a ronin...  You know why.  You know they're laughing.  Wait, wait, wait.  Ronins are this, okay?  I'm a ronin.  The master's dead.  No, no, no.  Yeah, that.  And I'm roaming free.  And now you're free.  I'm free in the streets.  But you're like a renegade.  Yeah, sometimes people go, will you carry this bag of rice, please?  You know what I mean?  And I go, okay.  Right?  And I do it.  Or will you kill this guy? 
[02:05:00]  And I slice him up, you know?  Right.  But I'm a loner.  I'm like Sanjuro.  You know, you ever see that movie?  Kurosawa movie?  Ah, no.  Yo-himbo?  Yo-himbo?  I didn't see that one.  Okay, well, he's like a ronin, you know?  A ronin, though.  I know a ronin.  Yeah, yeah.  The master's dead.  I'm enjoying you.  I enjoy you.  We love Bobby.  God damn, man.  Wow.  Okay, so it's him.  I'm just thinking about shitty.  I'm just getting annoyed for Bobby.  I don't even know who this comic is.  I don't watch that dumb cornball show.  But I don't.  Whoa, awkward again. 
[02:05:30]  Got it.  Got it.  But I fucking, I just hate, that's what I hate about Los Angeles.  And it'll happen here in New York, too.  But that really annoys me.  Oh, God.  I imagine he's quirky.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We did that bit.  Oh, that's so funny.  A little quirky, a little quirky.  I hate those fucking...  Now, were you, you know, you were on a pretty successful show there, Mad TV.  Yeah, it got really successful.  Well, I said pretty...  Nine Mexicans watched it.  I said pretty successful.  It got your name out there, Bobby.  Sure.  You were the funniest part of that whole show. 
[02:06:00]  Well, thank you for saying that.  And no, I'm not just saying that.  When you went out, or were you like, hey, I'm on fucking Mad TV?  Well, I was, when I was in, on the show, I was a little nuts.  Yeah.  Because no one watched it.  We're kind of under the radar, you know what I mean?  And I got to behave.  They weren't going to fire me.  Because I was, I slid in on the minority program.  Right, right, right.  This lady named Wenda Fong, who's the head of, I spit on you.  That's okay.  Head of diversity at Fox, right?  Head of diversity?  Diversity.  She goes, you're the only Asian at the time on any show.  We have to keep you on the show. 
[02:06:30]  Wow, you're in.  So I pooped in somebody's office, a producer's office.  And I pooped in one of the actor's dressing rooms, because I got mad.  Ike Barinholtz.  And Stephanie Weir, one of the actresses, saw me do it.  Saw the actual poop come out.  And then, you know, I went to rehab on the show.  You know what I mean?  Oh, here's another story.  I did.  Oh, I almost got sued by another actress named Krista Flanagan, who later was on Mad Men.  For what?  The first day of work, I didn't know who she was.  It was early in the morning rehearsals.  And she was sitting on the couch eating yogurt. 
[02:07:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And so I didn't know who she was.  And at the time, I've been there for five years, right?  So I'm not the guy, right?  So I grabbed the back of her head and I farted in her mouth.  Did you really?  Yeah, I farted in her mouth.  And then she started to cry.  She started to cry.  Which is bullshit.  Yeah.  For a lot of fucking chicks.  My fart might be pungent.  Right?  But it doesn't cause tears.  You know what I mean?  She started to cry.  And then this Canadian actor, Ron Peterson, physically assaulted me.  He started throwing punches.  Wow.  While Mike McDonald put him in a kimura or like a headlock. 
[02:07:30]  Did you know him?  Yeah.  Mike's a friend of mine.  No, no, no.  The guy who was assaulting you.  Yeah.  He was a friend of mine, too.  And then later, I had to meet with my lawyer and I had to explain to them what happened,  which was really awkward.  I bet.  Because you're in a room with lawyers and they're like, tell us what happened.  Then they don't understand.  Well, she was sitting there eating yogurt and I, I don't know, I grabbed her head and I  felt farted in her mouth.  And then there's like that 10 second like pause of like, I'm trying to like, go why?  You know what I mean?  Why would you do that?  They can't understand that. 
[02:08:00]  Did you ever think that she had to go home and people were like, how was, how was it?  The guy farted in my mouth.  And then what I did was this, this is what I did because I'm a, I'm a weasel.  I bought a $500 gift certificate to Burke Williams, which is a massage place, which is  a full day massage.  It's great.  You should do it if you're ever in LA.  And then I put her in a big sketch that I was doing that I, you know, at the time  there was a character named Tank.  I brought her in there.  You didn't need to do it.  She became, no, I did because you know what I mean? 
[02:08:30]  Oh, you were trying to, she wanted to get out of the show.  Yeah.  Like she hated it that much.  And she was on Mad Men?  And then later she became out, got on Mad Men.  Did you become friends with her?  Yeah.  Very close friends.  Really?  Like whenever I have a birthday party every year, she organizes it.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm a dream weaver.  I am a dream weaver and people really love me.  And the second thing is, is this, I say this, she was on the cover of, um, Playboy  magazine like four or five months ago.  Oh really?  Oh really?  Yeah.  Krista Flanagan.  Yeah.  Because of Mad Men, not Mad TV.  Can we look her up?  Kim Jong-il farted in my mouth while I was eating yogurt. 
[02:09:00]  You know Connie Chung, right?  Yeah.  The guy that plays him.  Fuck, I know her.  Let me see.  Wow, you farted in her mouth?  Wow.  I can't see her tits.  She's like your sister.  Wow, very nice.  Let me see her in her big juicy nipples.  Look at how pink they are.  She should have farted in her tits.  I farted in her mouth.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were trying to do your own anime porn there.  Did people laugh when you did it or no?  Oh wow.  No, no one laughed.  She has like a 60s body.  Yeah, she looks like a 60s chick. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, right on.  And they're gone with that look right there.  She's a great girl.  She's very talented.  Yeah, she looks great.  Yeah, she's great.  But anyway, farted in her mouth.  Oh.  And then what else happened?  Oh, look at the panty pit.  That's very funny.  You had to talk to the lawyer.  That's classic.  For that.  There's nothing worse than sitting in front of lawyers and having to explain something  so stupid and indefensible, yet it was perfectly fine when you did it because it was under  the guise of just whatever it was.  It's not like we're on a Nickelodeon show.  Right.  You know what I mean?  I mean, this is like a late night comedy show.  Yeah.  I mean, you just assume that there are things like that that go on, like pooping and stuff. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  It gives people stories until years later.  Sure, sure.  It's not like what happened there on that wild show you guys used to do.  Nothing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You need shit stories.  Yeah.  Like what Artie did.  Right.  You know what I mean?  For what?  Well, he was on MADtv.  Oh, that's right.  You know what?  I don't remember.  I don't associate him with Artie Lang.  Yeah, Artie Lang was on MADtv.  What did he do when he was on MAD?  Well, he was on the table where he was dressed up as a pig, right?  Did cocaine, ran out of it.  Police arrested him.  You know, that whole story.  Oh, I didn't even know that. 
[02:10:30]  It was crazy.  He was a maniac.  Yeah, he was a maniac.  Have you seen Artie lately?  No.  What's he doing these days?  He popped up for a second or two at the cellar.  He did a spot at the cellar, but I was out of town.  I haven't seen him since, huh?  I don't know.  I hope he's doing well.  Is he healthy?  I don't know.  Well, we saw, he popped up at the comedy cellar and he looked like he was doing very well,  but then people haven't seen him since, so I don't know what's going on with him.  Let me ask you, these comics that still use and stuff, I mean, how?  I don't know.  I never did comics.  I was three years sober when I first tried stand-up. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, because I was 13 years sober, you know what I mean?  When I got on MAD, I relapsed and now I have eight years.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, and I, like, I know that I wouldn't be alive if I was still using, you know what  I mean?  How long did you relapse for?  Yeah.  For a couple years, you know.  And how did you relapse?  Like, what was the first thing you did?  Well, when I got on MAD, you know, I'm excited and stuff, and one of the producers literally  looks at me in the eyes and says, listen, I was there doing your auditioning and I just  want to let you know, I just don't think you're right for the show.  Oh, so you had it.  Because I'm not going to be campaigning for you. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, I'm sure you're a great stand-up, whatever, but.  Oh, you're shitting.  So I, and then, you know, and I acted for a couple weeks, you know, I wasn't getting  in shit, you know what I mean?  And I just said, fuck this, I want to get out of this situation.  And they wouldn't hire me because of that diversity fucking bullshit.  You know, we need a gook, you know what I mean?  They wouldn't fire you.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  That's what they, you know.  Wow.  Every show needs a gook.  Why can't I say gook?  You can.  You can.  I just did.  And then so.  Because you are one.  Yeah, I am one.  You're allowed to say that you are one.  I'm a pan-faced gook.  I take it to the next level. 
[02:12:00]  You know what I mean?  If you are one, you're allowed to say it.  I look like I did a 100-yard dash in a 90-yard gym.  Another joke.  But, um.  Jesus.  You heard that.  That's funny.  Yeah.  So anyway, so I took, I couldn't sleep, so I took Valiums at first.  Oh.  Which is considered a relapse.  And I talked to a friend that was in the program because that was a relapse.  So then I started taking Vicodin.  And then literally in months, within months, I was taking 30 Vicodins a day drinking.  Holy Jesus.  For two years straight.  And then they finally fired me. 
[02:12:30]  Then I got sober.  And then I stayed on the show.  Can I be the stupid one?  How does that not kill you?  30 Vicodins a day and drinking.  Brett Favre and Rush Limbaugh did more.  Really?  Yeah.  Were you not shitting?  Because Vicodin, you can't shit when you do Vicodin.  No, no, no.  I did not.  No.  30 a day, though.  Wow.  But did you, did I ever tell you the story about my last day of relapse?  Oh, no.  When I, last day I used?  So Fox gives me an intervention.  Okay?  They say you either get sober or you're out.  So you know what?  In my insanity, I go, I'll get sober.  Right? 
[02:13:00]  So this comic in LA, Duncan Trussell, comes to my house.  He takes all my Vicodin the day before my last day of a live shoot, right?  So I show up at the live shoot and they wrote me a Connie Chung sketch.  Okay?  So I'm dressed up as Connie Chung.  And in the makeup chair, I can see that, like, little squirts of poop are coming out of  my hole.  Like, you know how you squeeze real tight, but still it's coming out?  Like, it's nothing.  And I feel...  A little marble pops.  A little marble, yeah.  And you think it's going to be a huge log.  And my organs feel like they're, you know what I mean, hitting against each other. 
[02:13:30]  I'm sweating and I'm shaking.  I'm scared.  Okay?  Wow.  So then I show up at the set, a live audience, right?  And I know it's going to...  I can't remember a line because I'm dying.  Okay?  The lights come on and I hear, action!  And I look in the camera and I go, good evening.  And shit comes all the way down my stocking.  You shit your pants?  I shit my pants on television.  Right?  But it's pre-taped.  Is this available somewhere?  No, it's pre-taped.  Okay?  So then I hear, cut! 
[02:14:00]  Right?  And then the producers run up, right?  Dick Blasucci yells in my face, right?  This 60-year-old SCTV veteran, right, who used to live with Bill Murray.  You know what I mean?  Like, you know what I mean?  These old-timey, you know what I mean?  He goes, you're doing it!  You're going to finish it!  Right?  So now the wardrobe is cleaning the poop off my stocking.  And I'm sitting there sweating.  Is the audience howling?  No, you can hear grumbling.  I'll show you.  You know what I'm talking about?  Do they know you were just shit?  Was that obvious?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They didn't know.  They didn't know, but they knew something went on because women are taking wet naps 
[02:14:30]  and wiping poop off my stockings, right?  Oh, man.  Were you embarrassed?  What?  Were you embarrassed?  Are you kidding me, dude?  I'm like, how do I get a gun?  I was going to kill myself.  That's not even funny.  I was going to die that night.  Here's the worst of it.  Here's the worst of it.  I finished the sketch, right?  Barely.  Okay?  They're not going to air it.  I know they're not going to air it.  It's the last night.  I know I'm fired.  Okay?  So I'm packing up my dressing room while everyone's having a party.  It's the last show.  You know what I mean?  They have the party. 
[02:15:00]  I'm packing.  I'm in boxes.  I walked to my GT.  I had a Volkswagen.  What do you call it?  A GT.  Anyway, a car.  A little car.  A little car.  A little car.  And I put my box in there.  No one says goodbye to me.  I get in the car.  I'm crying.  And I'm driving.  That's not funny.  Oh, no.  It's not.  I'm sorry.  It's the saddest thing.  It's not funny.  It's hilarious.  So I drive.  The next day, my manager drives me to a place called the Optimum Health Institute.  It's not a rehab. 
[02:15:30]  What they do is they feed cancer patients wheatgrass to get them healthy.  Right?  And they do wheatgrass colonics where they stick wheatgrass in people's assholes.  Right?  Wow.  To flush them out.  The fuck?  I don't even know what happened.  Two days later, I'm in the bathroom, naked, on the ground, with a tube in my ass, with  blood, wheatgrass, and shit all over the floor.  Right?  Shaking.  And that was my bottom.  Yeah.  I hope so.  That was my bottom.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it was.  And I had a divine intervention. 
[02:16:00]  Did you get back on meds to the internet?  What do you mean divine?  What happened was this.  And, Jake, this is the miracle of life.  And this is why I believe there's a God.  And I'm not even lying.  All right.  Okay?  What happened was, about five days later, because I couldn't eat wheatgrass anymore.  And they also put, like, beans, like, organic, raw food.  Right?  And there was a fucking In-N-Out, maybe through a forest.  Down a forest, about half a mile away, there was an In-N-Out.  Right?  So it wasn't a lockdown.  Right?  So I had some money.  So I ran through the forest late at night and escaped. 
[02:16:30]  I went to the In-N-Out.  And then I went to the Vons next door to get an apple.  And when I was at the Vons, it was like 2 in the morning.  I don't know why I'm whispering, but this is really deep.  Yeah.  I get a tap on my shoulder.  And it's this guy named Will.  He was my first sponsor when I was 16 years old.  No way.  Yeah.  And I go, he goes, what are you doing here?  I thought you lived in L.A. and whatnot.  And I go, I told him my story.  I go, what are you doing?  He goes, he was driving from a meeting in, like, Arizona, right?  To San Diego. 
[02:17:00]  And he, something told him to pull over to that Vons.  So then he gave me all my old A-Numbers, right?  I put them in.  Check it out, bro.  I got out of that Optum Health Institute.  And then I got out.  I did Harold and Kumar, the first movie.  Then I did, I started headlining or whatever.  And one of the producers, a man who I didn't even know was sober, saw me at a meeting.  And she told Fox, you know, he's doing great.  He goes to meetings every day.  They gave me, like, a three-month trial.  And then I stayed on it for six more years.  Six more years.  Watch it, man.  Yeah.  Whoa, man, that is divine. 
[02:17:30]  That's a great story.  I mean, you know what I mean?  You wanted to laugh.  Let's clap it out.  You wanted to laugh at Danny.  Let's clap it out.  But there was a spiritual moment at the end.  That is divine.  I'm not going to make fun.  It was a divine intervention.  What are the odds?  It was certainly divine, Bobby Lee.  What are the odds?  Guy's going from fucking Arizona to San Diego.  He stops.  Yeah.  He's been downhill since then.  You were skating.  No, you're doing great.  How long sober now, Bobby?  Eight years.  Eight years.  God bless you.  Great, man.  Bobby Lee's going to be at Caroline's.  You've got the two shows tonight, the two shows tomorrow, and then one show Sunday.  Bobby Lee's hilarious, obviously.  A very entertaining guy.  You've got to see him at Caroline's. 
[02:18:00]  A very funny guy.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  We should take a break.  Okay.  I think you watch the Jersey Shore?  Yeah, I love them.  Are you just saying that?  No, I've seen the first season.  Well, they're up to the season eight.  Yeah, I saw the first one, though.  Okay.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  We've got Vinny from the Jersey Shore.  Yeah, I'm going to watch.  Can I stay and watch?  Yeah, you're hanging.  Yes.  No, we're here.  We've got Brooke Shields coming in today.  I did a pilot with her once.  She won't remember me.  I had like three lines.  All right.  And Russell Peters.  I know Russell.  Yeah, Russell's funny.  I love Indians.  Can you hang for the rest of the show?  Yeah, I'd love to.  We're not going to mind fuck you today, Bobby.  No, this has been brilliant. 
[02:18:30]  It's been great so far, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  So, I think Vinny and his uncle will be on the show next.  If not, more with Bobby Lee.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Serious.  Next time.  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  We've got Bobby Lee in studio playing Caroline's this weekend. 
[02:19:00]  Bobby, what are you on Twitter?  Hello?  Is it Bobby Lee Live?  Bobby Lee Live.  Twitter.  But I only do it like once a month.  I Twitter one thing.  You're a good guy to have on Twitter, though.  I Twittered something this morning.  That's it.  Oh, same.  What happened was I walked into my hotel room and this big black man with tattoos on his face  asked me for a cigarette and I gave him the whole pack.  Are you there?  And ran?  No.  I gave him the whole pack and I'm like, why did I give him the whole pack?  Because I was so scared.  You were scared.  Yeah, yeah.  And now I have no cigarettes.  That might have been a ploy, though, to like blindside you and like pound you on the 
[02:19:30]  side of the head.  No, I know.  But then since you gave him the whole pack, you probably went like.  And that's why I'm crafty.  That is crafty.  And that's why I'm a survivor.  That is good.  That is good.  I like that.  Because a lot of times you're like, hey, could I have a cigarette, man?  And then you go to look down to grab your cigarette and you wake up and if it's the summer, you  wake up and Christmas music's playing.  Right, right.  Or if it's around Christmas time, you wake up and it's hot out.  Yeah.  Then you're the guy in that movie Irreviscible.  You don't need to be over it for five minutes.  Exactly.  But the classic one that we finally told people about, they, the people that will do you wrong, 
[02:20:00]  will ask you for directions on the streets of New York.  And Anthony came up with this and you go, let me see, which way is north?  And you look in and they want you to turn around like, I think it's.  They want you to turn like this.  Like they know which way your face.  So they go, yo, which way is north?  And then you turn to look and boom.  And they falcon punch you.  So if that ever happens, I know what to do.  Do not.  Look straight.  Look straight ahead.  I don't know which way you're north.  I don't know what north is.  I don't have a comment.  Just do your broken English.  I don't know what north is. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Korea, Vietnam.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you ever done broken English to get yourself out of something?  No, that's a good idea though, right?  That is.  I think I love them.  That wouldn't work.  They just think easier Mark.  Right.  He's not going to be able to get a description.  When I was in South Africa, I was there four months ago with Pablo Francisco and Ian Bagg and  a bunch of comics.  Sorry.  I walked out of my hotel room and two black guys pushed me into the ground and they stole  my BlackBerry.  No.  And I didn't go to the police.  You know who Ian Bagg is?  Yes.  Yeah.  I didn't go to.  I was with.  I later I saw Ian and then he goes to go to the police. 
[02:21:00]  I'm not going to go to the police.  Yeah.  Two black.  You know, you can't say two black guys.  You'll end up fucking arrested abroad.  Yeah.  Arrested abroad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In prison.  So I just let them take my BlackBerry.  Wow.  Two black guys in South Africa.  Yeah.  Frisk everybody.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I mean, if it was a Samoan, then I would say it was a Samoan guy and they'd go, oh,  we know who that is, but.  Ain't like playing Sun City anymore.  But it was during the day though.  It was during the day.  Two o'clock.  Brazen.  Outside my hotel room.  Brazen.  How did they know you were on your BlackBerry? 
[02:21:30]  Are you using it yet?  No, it was in my pocket.  They threw two big black guys, pushed me to the ground.  They went through my pockets.  That's all they could find was my BlackBerry because I keep my wallet in my front pocket.  Did they say anything to you or no?  No, no, no.  They just ran off with it.  They didn't hurt you?  Well, no.  They hurt me emotionally.  It kind of hurt.  But I mean, they didn't punch you.  No, no, no, no, no.  Threw you to the ground though.  Did you want to drop the N-bomb?  No, no, no.  You can't do that there.  Why?  I've never.  I thought that was like an American word.  I've never dropped the N-bomb in front of black people.  Only behind their backs.  Yeah, let me try.  That got me thinking like, have I ever done that like in front of anybody? 
[02:22:00]  But only in a joking matter.  I never did it in a hostile way.  Like, F that N.  You know what I mean?  I don't think I, I really don't think I have.  But with my windows rolled up, I am all man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I will say anything driving.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Really quickly because the show's going to get very busy.  Charlie Sheehan, you know, in the hospital.  Yes.  And Casey Jordan was a porn star, is a porn star, excuse me, that was partying with Charlie  Sheehan. 
[02:22:30]  And these clips are great.  Yeah.  There's three quick clips if.  Yeah, that's true.  You want to hear them?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she's the blonde, right?  She's little.  She's juicy, man.  She's pretty juicy.  But yeah, her vagina, I don't like her vagina at all.  I like a fat pussy.  I don't like it.  I like it like a flower when it opens up.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  You like a flower?  Yeah, yeah.  I like it when it's slit and then when you do magic to it, it opens up and says hello.  I want it to look like Nagasaki.  But when it's already sticking out like that, I don't like it.  No, Jimmy likes that.  You want to be the reason it opens up, Bobby.  Exactly.  Okay, I got you.  I'm a dream weaver.  Jimmy likes it when you ever leave a slice of London broil in the microwave just a little 
[02:23:00]  too long and it goes, pfft, it just explodes on you.  Jimmy likes it to look like that.  Yeah.  I want it to look like a fucking exit wound.  Like an IAD just went off or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, Casey Jordan is talking about partying with Charlie Sheehan.  Here's the first clip.  We ended up all going over to Charlie's house.  When I first saw him, he was just fucking wasted in his mind, which I was trying to get  to that point too.  Trust me.  So you guys started drinking or what?  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  And I said, I can beat you.  I'll beat you in drinking.  And he's like, bulls**t.  And I just made myself like an all vodka drink, just all vodka with a splash.  And he grabs it from my hand.  I love the guy, right?  He f***ing grabs it and just starts, he chugs it in like three seconds.  I'm like, he's like, don't ever, don't ever test me again.  I was like, and everyone was like, don't make him another drink.  And I'm like, I won't, I won't.  This one's for me if he doesn't drink it.  Okay.  So anyways, the drinking, like eventually it was like too much.  And it was that time of night where everyone was too drunk. 
[02:24:00]  So there was a phone call for the drugs.  She has a pussy the size of an elephant.  It's a big, long pussy.  That is a giant pussy.  Like from, from the, the, the top of the, like tailbone to the ass hole is a good, like  eight inches of pussy.  I would just have that on my face.  That's a perfect vagina.  You like that?  I don't like it.  Yeah.  It's a little too big, a little too much action.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's fucking Oprah's pussy.  You know what I mean?  You imagine Oprah had it.  Oh my God. 
[02:24:30]  That's gotta be a lot of pussy.  I'd never fuck her like that.  That's gotta be a lot of pussy.  What?  Like what?  Well, that guy's fucking her well.  Silly me.  I thought you meant like from behind.  I can't even, I can't even do that position.  I can't either.  My dick would wilt like fucking, like somebody pinched it.  No, I'm like missionary and then a top is good too.  God, look at that big fucking clit.  She's fucking amazing.  I hate it.  I definitely do a private with her.  There's just too much going on over there.  I know.  I love that.  It looks like when I was a kid and used to put a whole pack of hubba bubba in my mouth.  True. 
[02:25:00]  With a big dick going in and out of it.  That is a fucking perfect, fat, meaty pussy.  You like that meaty pussy?  I love it.  Love it.  The fucking, the dick is squeezing shit out of it like a Play-Doh Fun Factory.  Yeah, but you don't know what the parts are.  No.  Is that a part of the labia?  Is that a part of the skin?  I don't know what that is.  Yeah, there's a few extra parts there, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's too complex.  So Casey Jordan went over and challenged Charlie there.  They're doing a lot of drinking and then this is what happened next. 
[02:25:30]  Uh, some, some guy came over with like, like a side bag.  It was really nice.  Like, I think it was a Gucci.  The satchel.  Satchel, like, comes in, you know, all professional.  Nice guy.  He sits at the kitchen table, just dumps out like, like five A-balls.  Huge.  The size of my fist.  We're talking Coke.  What a rat.  Holy shit.  Why is she riding on Charlie?  I wonder if she's still drunk.  She's such a rat.  She's telling like, it's like, oh, and then I went in and they had a pinata and they said  surprise.  You don't fucking talk about Coke showing up. 
[02:26:00]  She's going to end up dead.  Oh my God.  Five.  That guy with the briefcase.  He's going to kill her.  Yes.  Yeah.  Charlie's not going to kill her.  It's going to be this guy going, what the fuck?  That was great.  Some kind of Mexican cartel guy came in.  His name was Juan.  Five A-balls as big as your fist.  Yeah.  But Charlie's also a part of like a Hollywood, you know what I mean?  A family.  And also his show is number, like in the top show.  Yeah.  CBS.  I wouldn't know.  CBS executives will kill this broad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just to keep the cash cow, you know, doing his job. 
[02:26:30]  Whew.  Coke.  We're talking like 20 grand, I swear.  Coke.  Like just like all on the table.  And I'm like staring at him.  I'm like, oh my God.  Oh.  So really do this stuff.  And so he gets it, the guy leaves or whatever, and then the drugs begin.  Who is she talking to?  Obi-Wan Kenobi?  Like who fucking got her to say this shit?  Right.  Like what the fuck?  We can't get anyone to say anything on this show.  We suck.  Like he's waving his hand or something.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like how much cocaine was that? 
[02:27:00]  That was a very good Obi-Wan, dude.  Give it a try.  Just got to be nasal.  What?  Who is this?  Like who is the guy?  I don't want to guess TMZ, but I don't know.  I have no idea.  That's amazing.  He always gets stuff out of people, that fucking guy.  Joe Shirk.  Huh?  Joe Shirk.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  I love him, Jimmy.  That was acting.  That was good.  Thank you.  But the name is a little much.  Joe Shirk.  Shut up with Shirk.  It's an awful name, right?  It is Joe Shirk.  More from porn star Casey Jordan. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  And then, you know, rolls into the morning.  Yeah.  This green pipe.  It looks like a bong, like for weed, but like, I don't know.  He just like took a chunk, because these are huge rocks, to slice it off.  And then he like shoved it right into the pipe and was smoking it, smoking the Coke.  And I'm like, I've never done that before.  Oh, blah.  He comes over like, come over and give me a kiss.  And he blows it into my mouth.  And I'm like, oh my God.  So I'm like, I don't mind.  Like she's a dog. 
[02:28:00]  She said Charlie was doing that?  Yeah.  Oh, that's crazy.  He's smoking Coke.  Oh, he's free base.  He's a dead man.  He's going to die.  He's on the number one fucking show.  Do you understand?  Eventually.  That stupid show is huge.  Huge.  Eventually, this will get him fired, because the advertisers will eventually get pressure.  Like, this guy is so overtly behaving fucked up.  They'll have to wait for the ratings to drop just a little bit.  The ratings are so fucking big, this guy is untouchable.  He can do whatever the fuck he wants.  Let's not forget about the hookers at the Plaza Hotel. 
[02:28:30]  That was only a month or two ago.  But how do you show up to a table read?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, you know what I mean?  You show up.  You know what I mean?  How do you work?  Yeah.  You have to read things.  Your timing has to be there.  But the weird thing is that fucking, what a blabbermouth.  Yeah.  We got Vinny and his uncle from the Jewish show, but I just want to play this last clip really  quick.  Okay, sure.  And then we'll get those guys in.  Casey wraps up here.  Casey Jordan, the porn star that was partying with Charlie Sheen.  What happened after you did the drugs?  I mean, did you guys go and watch anything in the theater or what exactly? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, we did.  Okay.  We watched porn.  Okay.  We sat there for like two hours and I sat there.  That's like us going home and listening to radio shows.  She's a porn star.  She has to sit there and watch porn with Charlie Sheen.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  I bet she was doing more than just watching.  I think she was sucking his dick.  His cocaine little fucking needle shriveled dick.  And he probably, he was probably just chewing his lip just going, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Suck.  Suck.  Chewing his lip. 
[02:29:30]  Trying to pucker his ass to make his dick a little harder.  Yeah.  Just anything.  Yeah.  And it ain't working.  He's just coke drunk fucking dick.  He has to do push-ups into her mouth so it fucking has.  Some stiffness.  Oh, forget it.  This guy's not yourself.  The shaft and his dick look like Estorol's neck.  Coke dick is hideous.  What's worse than coke dick?  It's like a wet pig knuckle.  This guy's not going to make it out of his 50s alive.  Nah.  Is he still in the hospital?  I don't know.  They said he was diagnosed, though, with a hiatal hernia. 
[02:30:00]  That's because he's got a great rep.  Because he was laughing so hard.  He was laughter.  He's got a rep that will spin anything.  It is amazing.  Yeah.  That's got to be a tough job in Hollywood.  Repping Charlie Sheen.  I sat there.  And I'm sitting there.  I'm like, because I do porn.  I'm like, oh, I know who that is.  I know who that is.  We're just going through all the porn.  He has so much porn.  He's a huge theater.  I think that's all he does is probably sit there and watch porn.  What did he do while you guys were watching porn?  Ah, good question.  He wasn't doing anything. 
[02:30:30]  He was just f***ing.  He just had his little green pipe with him the whole time and just kept hitting it.  This was the whole plan.  I was supposed to get.  Well, he already got apparently another girl, Bentley.  And he's like, well, what do you want?  Because he's like, I'm going to retire.  You know, he's like, I'm just going to go f***ing crazy.  We're going to get this house.  It's like a $20 million house.  Like 27 rooms.  And we're trying to like, you're like the missing puzzle piece.  We don't have a blonde.  And you're my blonde.  Are you in?  Are you not in?  Are you not?  And I'm like, of course I'm going to be in.  I want a blue Bentley because the other girl got all in.  It's a blue.  I had to leave because if I didn't leave, I'd probably be in the hospital because I couldn't 
[02:31:00]  keep up.  I called my driver.  I said, you need to get me out of here.  She has a driver?  I don't want me to leave.  But I was really shooken up.  I like had an anxiety attack.  I feel really bad.  I hope he is well.  And I hope.  Hooker's got a punch out.  I bet you here's why Charlie Sheen's smart.  That's one smart thing he does.  He has a Bentley pick them up or take them because A, it's very important looking.  B, they feel amazingly chauffeured.  And C, they're not getting loaded and driving home. 
[02:31:30]  So you're not going to be held liable for some chick killing herself driving.  That's actually a smart move.  Because he's so responsible.  No, but I'm saying with that one, he's smart.  I'm sure nothing in that is him thinking this is something smart.  It's an ulterior motive of just, yeah, it looks good.  Doesn't want her there in the morning.  He doesn't want to depend on the driver bringing him and being like her driver and being late.  Like, go pick these bitches up.  I need them now.  Right.  Like, that's all he's thinking.  He's not going, well, as long as everyone gets home safe, I'm feeling better about myself. 
[02:32:00]  Dude, if that's not the fucking, just sitting there hitting that pipe, fucking watching those movies.  Watching porn with the fucking chick right there.  But you're just sucking the fucking green glass dick.  He makes $600,000 a week on that show.  Whatever, whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  Why would you do that?  Because you're making $2 million.  Have some frozen yogurt and get blown.  And his dad is a respectable actor, right?  His dad's sober, too.  Martin's sober, too.  Yeah, but he doesn't call him like...  Marty.  No intervention? 
[02:32:30]  Nothing?  I don't know.  Maybe he gave up?  I don't know.  But, you know, you say, it's like, yeah, why don't you just have some yogurt and stuff like that?  I know.  This guy is so far fucking gone.  I know.  He is.  So far gone.  And he's been in and out of rehab over the years.  Yeah.  Back when his father used to do shit, when he was a kid, he'd put him in rehab and talk  about, like, yeah, my son's having, you know, troubles or whatever.  But now, it's like, hey, you're a grown man.  You know what?  I feel like Emilio.  Poor Emilio.  Yeah, Emilio. 
[02:33:00]  He's a good guy.  He's probably the good...  He gets shit.  He got nothing.  He's supposedly a really nice guy.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  And he gets, like, yeah...  He gets nothing.  He gets, like, two lines on some Nickelodeon show.  That's it.  Let's get Vinny from...  Yes, bring Vinny in.  Vinny from the Jersey Shore and, of course, his uncle, who was great on one episode of Jersey  Shore, Miami.  There is some rioting going on in Egypt, by the way.  Vinny!  I am not fucking happy.  What's going on, Vinny?  Bobby. 
[02:33:30]  You know Bobby Lee?  Jim Norton?  I don't think you guys...  You're my favorite one on the show.  You're the nicest one.  What's up, Vin?  The nicest one.  All right.  Take a seat.  Step on up to the microphone.  You're the one that my girlfriend and I, when we watch, we go, aww, when you come on.  When you have the little single camera.  I want you to look at me.  Oh, yeah.  Hi.  Why would you look at me?  Mr. Needy.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, shit.  Hold on, sorry.  Oh, when they sit in the little booth thing and the one camera on the face.  Yeah, when they look at the thing.  This guy's so likeable.  You're like, aww, right? 
[02:34:00]  The thick one.  You know the gorilla-looking one?  Ronnie?  Ronnie.  He seems sweet.  You don't like Ronnie?  Yeah, but he just looks...  The little neck.  You know what I mean?  What's your girlfriend look like?  Is she cute?  Oh, my God.  That's rude.  Oh, shit.  I'm kidding.  She's Mexican.  You wouldn't like her.  What do you look?  You never know.  You like Mexicans?  Remember the last girl?  Yeah.  That chick fucking...  There was a girl who was just walking by and fell in love.  This is Uncle Nino.  This is Uncle Nino.  Hi, I'm Bobby.  Bye.  What's up?  Uncle Nino.  Fucking Uncle Nino rules. 
[02:34:30]  Anthony, and that's Gregorio.  What's up?  What's up, buddy?  Look at him.  Complete with a pinky ring.  Nice.  No idea.  Yeah, I do.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me, I do.  I'm Jen.  I got a few of these.  Uncle Nino, come over.  Everybody has one.  They got a seat.  What they got?  They got a seat.  Sit next to me, Uncle El Nino.  What does Uncle Nino smell like?  Everyone smell their hand.  What does that smell?  Smells good.  Smells all right.  Smells like America.  Well, he brought you guys some homemade wine. 
[02:35:00]  Homemade wine.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  He makes his wine.  In Pellegrino bottles.  That's nice.  A little homemade wine.  My God, if he doesn't resemble the Dapper Don.  You really do.  You got a resemblance to the Dapper Don.  I'm fucking, hey.  Fucking fucking drunk.  I love this guy.  I told you it would be great.  Vinny knows.  Vinny knows.  Perfect for your show.  Vinny knows, man.  No other show. 
[02:35:30]  This guy's going to have his own show on MTV within a year.  I'm telling you.  Those pants are amazing.  It's like made out of Snuffleupagus.  You kill Snuffleupagus.  You like me?  They look warm.  I love this guy.  You like him?  That's a good thing.  He likes you.  I hope you like you.  Anthony, all right.  Hey, Jimmy.  Any relation to Anon?  No, but he has a brother named Jim.  When we met, he sent that to me.  Really?  And then he walked away.  So what's your story there?  What do you do?  I do as least as possible. 
[02:36:00]  That's good.  He just kicks you in.  Fucking just over it.  Oh, God.  I'm going to eat this fucking thing.  You've got to buy you.  He's breaking mics.  The mic just broke.  Just threw that to the corner.  We'll try this one.  Uncle Nino.  We'll try this one.  Uncle Nino's like crazy over here with the microphone.  All right.  There we go.  You put it back a little bit. 
[02:36:30]  I feel like I'm talking.  I'm trying to fall on my...  No, back.  We've got to hear you.  We've got to hear you, Uncle Nino.  We've got to hear you a little bit.  Someone tells me we won't have any trouble hearing you.  No trouble at all.  Perfect.  That's perfect.  Perfect view.  Not for me.  You guys were stuck in traffic, Staten Island?  For two fucking hours.  What was the problem?  Staten Island.  Whoever designed the Gowanus, the HOV lane,  it has barricades, so a bus broke down,  and there's nowhere to fucking go once the bus breaks down. 
[02:37:00]  Then you're stuck.  You've got to drive through the barricades.  Retard.  Oh, so they've got to go tow the bus?  Yeah, they've got to tow the bus.  Whoever designed it, because...  And then, like, you're sitting there like an asshole.  You're thinking that you're going to be flying through the HOV,  and then the regular traffic's going 80 miles per hour.  This guy got his shit in the back.  My name for hours got this fucking ice.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  There's ice on top of the fucking car.  Yeah, it blows up.  It starts hitting your windshield.  He's got a ski rack, and there's ice up there.  Pull over. 
[02:37:30]  Take the fucking ice.  Take it off.  He did that.  When we got to the city, he did that.  Exactly.  And Uncle Nino.  Fucking ice off the top of your car.  We went to the city, he's fucking...  He's like jamming on the fucking gas,  jamming on the brake.  I got shit.  You had a shit.  Did you do it already?  I don't know.  Yeah, I got fucking awesome.  Blow up a toilet.  I got fucking awesome.  By the way, this is what's with this...  I got fucking awesome.  What's with this fucking toilet?  It's like fucking permission.  Yeah, I lost all the toilet.  No, I fucking...  I sat down.  Well, I'm little.  I'm little.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, it's for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you like a nice high, thrown-like toilet?  I sat down on my fucking knees with my fucking mouth.  I swear to God, what the fuck is it?  You like a nice, big...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like this chair.  I wish you'd be comfortable on this chair right here.  Yeah, give it a try.  Let's make it comfy.  Love you.  This would be a goofy.  For the people that don't know, when they were filming Jersey Shore in Miami,  Vinny, you know, had Uncle Nino stop by.  Yeah.  And he fucking took over the house, and he's flirting with all the girls.  Yeah, yeah.  I was a fucking...  Did he get any action down in Miami, Uncle Nino? 
[02:38:30]  I'm actually...  I mean, when I'm with these kids, I'm living in my 20s again, you know?  Yeah, uh-huh.  I bet.  He actually got J-Woww and Snooki in the hot tub for the first time that season.  They wouldn't go in at all.  Really?  Vinny told me they haven't been in five, six weeks.  They haven't gone in the hot tub yet.  So you got him in the...  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, girls.  Come on.  So they come.  I was in fucking jail.  I was in the jacuzzi.  I said, J-Woww come up.  I have fucking boobs, and I became a fuck.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:39:00]  No, you can curse.  You can curse.  You can curse.  She looked down.  She's gorgeous.  Oh, you want to be a little more gentlemanly?  Yeah, J-Woww.  Vinny's a little nervous.  Vinny's so nervous right now.  It's like, hey, don't fuck up my gig.  You're going to blow up my whole spot.  Don't fuck up my MTV gig.  Listen, no, I got to say something.  Yeah.  About a couple of months ago, after that Miami show.  It's got to be good, bro.  Miami show.  So we're going to do an appearance in Delaware. 
[02:39:30]  So he takes me up there.  He says, come on, come on.  That'd be nice.  So we're up there, and there's like 500.  The place is like 1,500 people, 1,800 people in the place.  There's about 400 or 500 girls that pay like 200 hours to take a picture with him.  Right.  And with Uncle Nino, because I just was on the show.  So they took him to this room to take pictures.  It's like fucking 300, 400 girls lined up.  So I was like helping him.  And they would come on the other side.  So I said, come on, come on. 
[02:40:00]  Uncle Nino.  Vinny, we love you.  Uncle Nino.  I'm going to go take a picture.  So the guy told us, the ones that got the green bracelets, you know, take a picture with them.  So I'm like helping him up on stage.  Come on, come on.  Vinny gives me a dirty look.  He goes, Uncle Nino.  At the end of the night, he goes, Uncle Nino.  He says, you're a celebrity.  You got to let them come to you.  I said, well, I got fucking this over.  I want to get this over with.  That guy, he asked people to take a picture with him.  I want to get it over with.  What the fuck?  Anthony, I want to get it fucking over.  Let's take three, four fucking hours.  Let's take the pictures, man. 
[02:40:30]  Let's go fucking have a good time.  You know what I mean?  What the fuck?  Get it over with.  Come on.  I hear you.  It makes sense.  He's got this bodyguard, you know, Terry.  Terry's fucking good.  I know him since he's like 17 years old.  He was as big as a house when he was 17 years old.  Now he's in his 40s.  He's as big as a fucking building.  He's tremendous.  So we went to the teacher.  He hosted a teacher party a couple weeks ago.  So Terry came with us. 
[02:41:00]  So he says to me, the guy says, Uncle Nino, be good.  You're on probation, you know?  You're on probation with your nephew, you know?  You got to be good.  So this is Terry.  I'm on probation with my cousin with my nephew.  Fuck.  As long as I don't have to work back on to prison.  I've been on probation for years.  With my nephew, that's okay.  I can deal with it.  You're on probation.  There he is.  Just like there he is.  There he is.  He's going to kill me.  Is it your mom's brother or your father's brother? 
[02:41:30]  My mom's brother.  It's not his fault.  He was born, he was born.  They're all born in Sicily.  It's not my fault.  I was born and raised in Sicily.  And my father always told me, if you're somebody's guest, don't ever go there without a gift, you know?  That's why I brought the wine.  Yeah, I see the homemade wine, huh?  You're going to bring a rabbit, a chicken, a piece of bread, a fucking goat, a goat, whatever.  Bring anything.  That's his old world.  I like it.  Chicken.  That's what Asians do.  God only knows when my father was in all the real old time, you know? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  And when Vinny was born, he's got his first fucking...  What did grandpa give you?  It's over your bed.  My first birthday, I got a shotgun.  A shotgun.  I got a shotgun.  First birthday.  First birthday.  His first.  Hanging over my bed.  And he's got it over his bed still.  That's hysterical.  That's pretty cool.  My father was beautiful.  He was beautiful.  Oh, that's great.  He loved Vinny over it.  If it didn't, it would just sit him on his lap when he was like a year, two years old.  He's not like that. 
[02:42:30]  He fed him more fucking rabbit brains and fucking rabbit balls and goats balls.  I swear to God.  What happened to the rest of the rabbit goat thing?  You got to eat the balls.  It is really good.  I remember that as a kid.  Those are special.  Like, they just sit there and, oh, the brains.  The brains are the best.  The brains are pretty good, though.  I don't like the bed.  No.  That's fucking hilarious.  I was like, Roland, you left me in the fucking bed.  I used to come out of bed.  I waited for you for like 15 minutes.  I said, what the fuck, Roland? 
[02:43:00]  He told me he was going to bring me back to the fucking room.  I came up the hallway.  I said, wait a minute.  Sorry, because there's this guy.  What the fuck?  This guy.  I said, buddy, it was an open entry show.  Go down the hallway to your fucking left.  I said, all right.  Thank you, bud.  Thank you.  That's all right.  Got a little Dangerfield in him.  A little Rodney in him.  Do you get a little nervous, Vinny, where it's like, oh, boy.  With him?  Yeah.  All the time.  Really?  Is your mom like this, Vinny?  No.  Because you're so quiet.  No one's like it. 
[02:43:30]  We're the complete opposite.  We're calm.  We're whatever.  That's not my fucking fault, dude.  But on the show, especially, because we're filming, you know, and the producers, and who's  black, who's Spanish, who's this, who's that.  You never know what this guy's going to say.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Let me fucking talk.  And these three come up to me. 
[02:44:00]  And he's like, there goes all my fucking money, everything, guys.  What do you give me this fucking water for, this guy?  Roland gave him a bottle of water, and he's like, what do you give me this fucking water  for?  Water makes rust, my father's dad.  Water makes fucking rust.  What's your poison?  What do you like to drink?  I'm going to have two bottles of wine.  You're a wine guy?  Hey, if you want to, you know, open up the wine.  Jesus, at 9.30?  You got to come up?  Open up the wine.  Well, we got to try the homemade wine from Alino, man. 
[02:44:30]  We got to try that shit.  We're going to relapse, Tim.  We're going to relapse.  Today's don't count.  Today's don't count.  Bobby, don't relapse on this shitty homemade wine, man.  It's so dark.  Buddy, I don't know what I call it.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  You want me to put this in?  No, you want it, you open it up for him.  Oh, you want me to open it up for him?  No, no, that's right.  No, I took a sniff.  I almost got sick.  No, no.  He almost got sick on the water.  Fucking, it was announced that Jersey Shore is going to continue in Italy. 
[02:45:00]  Mm-hmm.  You get another season, Vinny.  Yeah, well, it's just like the first ripple, you know, the first thing they send out there  like, shut up.  What's the best thing that comes out of a penis?  The fucker wrinkle.  Right?  The wrinkle.  I don't understand that.  Nothing else going to come out.  Let me get those wrinkle down.  Yeah, Jersey Shore in Italy, they sent it out there to see, you know, hopefully. 
[02:45:30]  When are you going?  It goes through.  If anything, it will go like the spring break season, like April.  Jesus.  May, and then hopefully come back to the summer, like at the Jersey Shore.  Another payday for Vinny.  Congratulations.  When I come to that, I tell my nephew, take my picture and put it in your pocket, you  know?  So I'll travel.  I'll be all over with him.  Don't forget my picture.  Is the show on over there?  Yeah, it's all over the world.  Why don't you ever be there?  Not too much.  I've never been there.  My mother's born there.  We have a house there, but I've never been there.  Why is Bobby born?  Why is everybody?  Don't drink it.  I'm not going to drink it. 
[02:46:00]  Don't drink it.  It's like Jeff, you.  What the fuck?  This fuck, I don't know if I'm going to bite this one.  It's good.  I don't have to.  I've been drinking all fuck a week.  Man, no shit.  Some open, Sam.  Sam, don't be rude.  Be fucking mad.  Have a...  Yes!  I'll try it.  I'll try it on Tomino's wine.  You're fine.  You're fine.  It's not fucking good.  It's got a sweet taste to it.  Mmm.  Sweating.  Nice, huh?  Anthony?  Yeah, that's good. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, chintan.  Chintan as well.  Oh, hand nose.  Have some, Sam.  Thank you, Bobby.  We'll make a toast to the crack that never heals.  The more you rub it, the better it feels.  If you scrub it from here to hell, you never get rid of that fishy smell.  Nice job.  I do.  I thought it was an asshole until the last line.  Then I realized vagina.  I actually want to write that down.  What is it again?  I want to write it down.  You got to write it down.  Oh, shoot. 
[02:47:00]  I finally, you know, years ago, I got it.  The most I ever got, the first I ever got was a, that was a model.  It's not bad.  Yeah, it's delicious.  This wine's not bad.  Yeah.  It's not bad.  Yeah.  It's no, this is the juice of life.  You know what I mean?  It's why it's the juice of life.  It's life juice.  This beats Dr. Steve's shitty wine.  He's.  Dr. Steve don't know how to make a wine.  What kind of fruit do you use in your wine?  Ah, grapes.  What kind of fruit?  Just grapes.  Grapes.  That's it.  You don't fancy it up with any other shit, right? 
[02:47:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  It's just straight grapes.  Old school way.  Damn, that's not bad.  How long does it take you to make it?  Uh, takes two days to make it.  28 days to ferment.  And 28 days to become wine.  So it's about two months process.  Oh, okay.  Depends on the weather and the climate.  He's a new bobo.  I told you.  I love this guy, man.  Fucking holy shit.  You all right, Vinny?  I'm good.  You're hanging in there.  This was your idea, you know?  I know.  Vinny just sits smiling, shaking his head like, I'm clinching. 
[02:48:00]  He's clinching.  You can tell he's clinching.  That's fantastic, man.  What, uh, where does he live?  Where does he live?  I don't know.  All over Staten Island.  All over Staten Island?  All over the streets.  He's right on the street corner.  Yeah.  What?  What?  You've been to Staten Island, like, for a lot of years?  Uh, most of my life.  Yeah?  Since I was 12 years old.  Oh, okay.  From Sicily right to Staten Island.  Wow.  How old were you when he went to Florida?  Uh, fucking...  Everything is 1976. 
[02:48:30]  What time in 1976?  He went down to Florida with $5 in his pocket and hitched a ride.  He came back driving a fucking Ferrari with a hot model next to him.  And a fucking Harley Davidson.  Harley Davidson.  There you go.  He does shit like that.  Yeah.  I went there for seven days to rest, you know, to chill out, you know?  Yeah, yeah, you got it.  I know what rest is, yes.  For seven days.  I went there for seven months there.  Really?  Wow.  Seven fucking months.  I guess it worked out well.  I was there for seven days.  I didn't meet a friend of mine at the airport.  My brother's friend, Peter. 
[02:49:00]  He said, me, I'll meet.  You're going to stay with Peter, huh?  So I went down there.  Peter wasn't there.  So I was hungry.  There's this girl eating at the restaurant.  A nice blonde.  So I went to sit down.  So I sit down.  You dinner with her?  In my bags in the lobby.  Hey, you dinner with her?  I went, I believe what the fuck?  Peter never showed up.  I never seen Peter.

The last day I was there.  Best seven months of my life.  The last day I was there, gee.  The last seven days.  So she says to me, she says, oh, Ed, you open.  Yeah.  She says, tonight, I'm going to take you to the best club in North Miami.  I mean, she's, so I said, all right.  So it's the best club in Miami.  So it was called Facades. 
[02:50:00]  This is 1990.  1990.  So I was, she's a hairdresser, you know.  She was shown three beauty salons.  Great, great.  She had about 30, 40, 50 guys.  Oh, mostly gay, which I don't mind, you know.  Almost, if I say almost, I say whatever.  Fuck, don't mind.  I'm into, I'm into sexual.  Into any fucking thing.  So I go, I mean, I walk in the place.  I got my fucking little beach outfit on.  It was like tuxedos, limousines in front of places, Ferraris, fucking, whatever. 
[02:50:30]  So I walk in, it was a big, it was like 3,000 people in a fucking joint.  I walk in and this fucking girl walks by with two old men and they walked them up to the  VIP room.  And she was dusting the fucking big, like, shoot that Linda Carter, Wonder Woman, you  know, with two old men next to you, you know, walking, fucking guys opening, fucking making  this room for him, seven bodyguards in the back of them.  And she kind of looked at me, like, I was at the bar, I was, cracked, you know, I was  fucked up. 
[02:51:00]  So anyway, so.  Hurry up, bro.  Oh, it's all right.  Oh, it's okay, man.  It's fine, it's fine, believe me.  It takes me two hours, like 16 minutes.  Slow down, man.  The fuck, hey, she rushes me.  The road you rush me, the road you take me.  Anyway, by the way, I was there seven fucking minutes.  It wasn't seven minutes.  Anyway, this girl comes over, she walks up to the VIP room.  I'm talking to the guy at the bar, the bartender, he happens to be from Jersey, his name is Joe  from Avenue.  So I'm talking to him, how you doing, how you doing, how you doing, how you doing, how you  getting along great.  All of a sudden, I lean over, and I pick myself up, and the fucking tit is on my fucking back.

She goes, oh, you speak Italian.  I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, see, see, see, see.  By the way, make a long story short.  That night, I went up, the girl that took me to the club, I'd never seen her again.  I'd never seen her again.  So that was my last night in Miami.  It was supposed to be.  So I met this girl.  She comes over, I took a ride. 
[02:52:00]  She introduced me to the owner.  We borrowed his car.  He had a Pantera, brand new Pantera.  Remember, I was gone for three fucking days with this girl.  Three days we were gone, whatever, we went up in the shop, whatever, in the keys or whatever.  Anyway, I was there for seven months.  This girl turned out to be Johnny Carson's mistress.  If you listen to me, I love you, whatever.  Judy, God bless everybody.  Who gives a fuck?  Anyway, that was the girl that I was there for story.  Wow.  She was banging Carson?

So she was with me for five, six months, and she'll never be the same.  And I said, fuck, a rehab.  And I showed her fucking rehab.  Shows her fucking rehab.  Yeah, because I kind of fucked up.  Doesn't that show you how fucked up women are, though?  You give a chick a half million, you say, take a nice vacation, and she bangs a guy for  three days.  I grew up all fucking rehab for me. 
[02:53:00]  I saved a couple of hours, but I was a thousand.  So I bought me a car and a motorcycle.  Anyway, that was that.  He's nervously texting before in the corner.  I can't understand that today.  I was a fuck.  We were driving.  We went to the fuck.  Oh, I love it.  We went to Atlantic City last week.  You know, my mother came.  I mean, his grandmother.  It was a great time, great time, great time.  I see my mother.  My mother danced on the floor.  It's a freak like in the water.  She was a 75-year-old lady.  She was riding a ball with all my sisters.

But anyway, driving down there, we were in the car in the limousine.  There was 10 of us.  Who was on fucking computer?  Who was on the radio?  Who was texting?  Who was on Blueberry?  Who was on Blackberry?  Blueberry!  I swear to God, I said, oh, what the fuck?  So I talked to Doug next to him.  I said, Doug, what happened?  He's young.  He's like 35 years old.

[02:54:30]  I was making some, I was doing some kind of a deal with a friend of mine.  The deal went sour.  So he owed me some money.  So I took this 30, 30 years, 1975, whatever, how many years ago?  1975.  So the fucking deal went sour.  So he owed me money.  So I took his fucking phone.  He owed me 35 years old.  Who's a fucking briefcase?  A briefcase.  You could fucking pull over.  You can't talk about it.  You have to pull over, plug it in.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Vinny, does Uncle Nino make an appearance on the Jersey Shore again or what?  What happened?  You have to wait and see.  Oh, shit.  All right. 
[02:55:30]  We got Uncle Nino.  I hear that because we did go visit, but I don't know if they're going to show it or  not.  So it might happen later on.  Believe me, they will look at that and go, yeah, I think we got to put this in.  Exactly.  I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.  Is it television?  Yeah.  We got a few of them in here.  I just bought a beautiful car.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  Are you going to text him, too?  No, I'm actually Twittering a photo of you as my new favorite person.  He has Twitter. 
[02:56:00]  He has Twitter.  Oh, what's your Twitter?  I have no fucking clue.  He has no real Uncle Nino.  I started it for him.  Real Uncle Nino.  But are you doing it or is he doing it?  No one does it once in a while.  I look at one.  It's one word, right?  He has little fucking minions on Staten Island.  He makes them follow them around.  Minions?  Videotape them and tweet for them and shit.  Oh, I'm talking about my friend Peter.  Peter.  What are you doing?  You listen to Peter?  Another Peter.  Peter, he's talking about you, Peter.  After Peter, he never saw it.  No, the other Peter.  Oh, by the way, Jimmy.  Yes.  Jim.

No, I just bought one.  I just like...  All right, so you're not taking one of these home with you.  No, I just bought a color TV.  It's black and white.  Yeah, I can't fuck you.

Anthony, he holds a big poker game.  Does he?  Yeah, big poker.  We just did one.  He doesn't have money to play.  But, I mean, he'll play.  He's one of the celebrities at the table.  There you go.  We're going to try to get another one together.  Oh, I stopped gambling.  I stopped gambling.  Oh, you did?  You want to make a bet?  Oh, I'm so...  What's that saying? 
[02:58:00]  I'm so broke, I can't even pay attention.  I'm so broke, I can't even change my mind.  He's the fucking master.  This guy's a star.  I got to say something.  Yeah, I got it.  You got to say something to what else is new.  It's not time to say something.  Yeah, exactly.  See, that stomach ain't coming up.  You know, fucking...  That old shit took me, straightened me right out.  As long as it...  Yeah, a shit sometimes will make...  If you got to take one, then you sit there and that's all you can think about.  That's right.  But the other thing...  You'll be comfortable over there.  I see it, I understand. 
[02:58:30]  What do you say?  I was sitting on the fucking floor.  On the short toilet, Bobby.  Yeah, but I was sitting...  Yeah, but I'm Asian.  We're small, we're small.  Oh, okay, so...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They should put down Asians or whatever.  Asians only.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Have a tiny condom dispenser.  Oh, I says, I was with this girl.  I says, Annie, is it in?  She says, yes.  Well, start walking towards me now.  I ask this guy, I says, buddy, have you ever seen the numbers on the condoms? 
[02:59:00]  He says, what numbers?  So I guess you don't have to roll it back that far, you know?  Bobby, right, Bobby?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  First time I had sex, I was so scared, I was all by myself.  I don't even understand him.  I don't know about him.  Oh, Bobby, I've heard every one of these jokes three hundred times.  What's the difference between a nanothamometer and an oral thermometer?  What's the difference? 
[02:59:30]  What?  Why them taste like shit, you know?  All right, take a break.  Take a break.  Oh, everybody knows about the story with the wolf with the three little pigs?  Yeah.  Right?  No, no, no, no.  No, he's got to tell it now.  He goes up to the house.  He goes up to the pigs.  He says, if you just don't come out, we'll blow the house down.  The pigs don't come out.  So he blows the house down.  He goes to the next door.  There's three more.  This town, there's a lot of pigs.  He goes next door.  There's three more pigs.  He says, if you just don't come out, we'll blow the house down. 
[03:00:00]  Two little pigs come out with machine guns.  They blow them away.  There's a guy walking by and says, Peter, what kind of pigs are those?  Those are guinea pigs.  That's the fuck out of here.  Switch.  Switch.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Can I keep going?  Shut up.  No, no.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I go for hours.  Vinny's killing.  Come on.  It was on a roll.  Once he bombs, then he is.  You're going.  Do you have racial jokes? 
[03:00:30]  I want to hear some racial jokes.  No.  No.  No.  I'm Asian.  No.  I'm Asian.  I'm Asian.  What do you call a fetching?  What?  Chunk.  How come only brothers could play basketball?  Why?  Because you got to know how to steal, run, and shoot.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Vinny is freaking.  Vinny is freaking the fuck out.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Vinny is saying his.  All right.  Put my hands in my pocket.  Shut up. 
[03:01:00]  You can do Asian.  You can do Asian.  That's it.  Yeah.  You can do Asian.  I love a rental woman.  I love a rental woman.  Yeah.  I love them.  Every time I go down, I get dizzy.  You're looking from side to side.  The old sideways.  I get dizzy.  It is horizontal like that.  Oh, my God.  I love black, white, black and white.  I don't give a fuck.  I love all kinds of people.  I.  I.  Women.  Yeah.  I love.  I love.  Commit.  I love black women. 
[03:01:30]  I always take a shot in the dark.  I say, buddy, I take a shot in the dark all the time.  I said, I'm done.  I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, he's having a fucking nervous, nervous break.  He really is.  You got value.  You got capital value.  The microphone fucking fires up his ass.  Oh, God.  God damn it, man.  Oh, no.  Fucking Uncle Nino.  I was with this guy.  I said, miss, did you ever have a 16 second orgasm?  He says, no.  He said, you got a fucking minute?  How many times did you hear that one, Vinny? 
[03:02:00]  That was 1993.  You guys have like the typical, you know, Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve dinner and stuff like that.  Every Sunday.  Every Sunday.  Every Sunday.  Every Sunday's Thanksgiving.  Oh, so you like, you say that.  And it gets very loud at the table.  Very loud.  He's not even the worst one.  There's other ones.  Oh, really?  We'll bring them all in one day.  Who's the worst?  Tell me.  Uncle Sal.  Yeah, he's good.  He's squirted.  He's quiet, but when he talks, he's deadly. 
[03:02:30]  My family, they're the bottom of the barrel.  Like, nicest people in the world.  Most genuine, good people.  But when it comes to women and partying, some low motherfuckers, man.  Just a little.  Like, there's ants.  There's ants.  There's ant shit.  And then there's my family.  Like, my uncles and my family.  Tom.  Bobby.  Yeah.  You want some more wine?  Bobby, get busy over there.  Bobby.  Hey, wait.  More wine, everyone.  I want some more wine.  I'm scared.  Wine, wine, wine, wine, wine, wine.  No, I'm bringing it back. 
[03:03:00]  Holy shit, man.  I was, that was, no, but because of my nephew, I was saying before, hold on.  He's like, hold on, take a sip of wine.  You put a dad on the...  Okay.  Oh, my God.  I'll breathe.  I'll breathe.  I'll breathe.  But, uh, I forgot what I was going to say.  I had a good memory, but it's fucking short.  You know what I mean?  I'll come back.  Oh, no, I'll come back.  So, what do you, Vinny, uh, for, for a couple of seconds, we'll talk to Bobby. 
[03:03:30]  Vinny can get a couple of seconds in.  So, what do you, what have you been up to?  What I've been up to?  Yeah.  Uh, I, I travel every weekend.  I do, like, club appearances for the show.  Those are pretty good, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did, like, last week, I was in, uh, you know, a couple different cities, and that's  really it.  You know, I've been trying to get into more of, like, a comedy, um, acting, like, that  kind of community, like, doing, like, classes during the week, and then doing the appearances.  Like, the appearance is, like, my waiter job, that's what I say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to set up, make some moves now for my future, you know? 
[03:04:00]  You want to be able to segue into some money instead of gigs.  My nephew.  My nephew.  My nephew.  Can you shut up for one fucking time?  No, apparently not.  Uh, you know what?  Go ahead.  No, one thing I have to say about him.  I'd love to be his company.  He's a total gentleman, and it's an honor to be with him.  Totally an honor to be with him.  Who?  Uh, he's great.  He's the best.  He's the best.  Yes, yes.  Did you do stand-up?  Yeah, you know, you gotta sit down.  He's afraid I just, like, anyway.  But the one thing I have to say about him, this fucking instant fame or overnight fame, 
[03:04:30]  it didn't go to Z, you know?  Maybe 10% went to Z.  10%.  Which is good.  Which keeps him alert, keeps him, you know, focused wherever he's at.  Then 91 went to his fucking cock, you know?  He's banging everything inside.  This comes from Terry.  He shows me pictures like he's banging people in the state, out of state, out of the country,  and God bless.  That was Uncle Nino 35 years ago.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You gotta get Russell in.  We're running out of show, and we got more and more people. 
[03:05:00]  I'll let Russell.  He's a friend.  Russell, come in.  Hey, he's doing it.  Russell Peters, what's up, bro?  Hey, I'm done.  Hey, man.  You stay here.  You stay, you stay, you stay.  How you doing, man?  What's up, Russell?  Good to see you, bro.  I love this guy.  I'm a big fan.  Oh, you know Russell?  Yeah, I'm a huge fan.  Yeah.  Russell.  What's up, man?  Huge fan.  Really?  Huge fan.  Fuck you, I'm a big fan.  I like when you make fun of Italians.  Bobby Lee's leaving?  He's just leaving?  Oh, he's doing it.  Bobby!  Anthony!  Bobby ran over here.  He's got his fucking back to this. 
[03:05:30]  Who is this guy?  Bobby is leaving.  Bobby Lee, Caroline, this weekend.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  Bobby Lee killed my mom.  That's his show.  I love you.  Thank you, Bobby.  I've been here all morning.  What am I, two Asians?  No, no, no, no.  Very good.  Where are you going?  That's the way he does theaters, and I do clubs.  Bobby!  Bobby!  Where are you going, a thing of shit?  No, you're going to take a shit off of an Asian tournament.  You're going to take a change in time?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got a loud fucking chick.  He's got a loud voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm fucking kidding.  He's got a chicken. 
[03:06:00]  He's a loud voice.  Yeah, my God.  You fucking just shook me up by fucking shit.  Hey, Bobby.  Hey, Bobby.  Hey, Bobby.  All right, Bobby's out of here.  Russell Petersen.  I don't know how he could do that much cocaine in the morning.  That's obviously old school.  That's Vinny's uncle.  Uncle Nino.  That's what I love about the old school.  They call it as they see it.  Yeah, they don't mean it in a bad way.  They don't know what PC means.  They just say what they see.  My dad said the same thing.  Oh, man.  That's why I'm fucking so fucking...  Because they don't know.  I know.  I'm a fucking FCC. 
[03:06:30]  What's his name, Russell?  Yeah.  Russell.  You know what my father always told me?  What do you tell you?  The best part of me ran down his leg.  Nice.  You sit around the table, though, with your family, and shit that comes flying out, you're  like, if anyone else heard this, I'd be persona not graphed up.  I have to say one last thing.  I'll shut up.  I'll shut up.  You did one last thing the past fucking 30 years.  When I hear like, Augie, Augie, and Anthony, Anthony, Augie.  Augie, Augie.  Hey, Augie.  Hey, Augie.  It's the Mexican guy, Augie.  Really?  No, like, I can't hear it at all. 
[03:07:00]  I was just fucking flashback of the Toilet Brothers.  Iron and urine.  Did you ever meet the Toilet Brothers?  Iron and urine.  Iron and urine.  They come from Flushing.  If you have me as a guest, they'll come as a guest, your guest, they'll have a lot of  shit to talk about.  I'm dying.  If you want, give me more wine.  Give me more wine.  Give me more wine.  You got it in Pellegrino, Bob, to keep it real.  Yeah.  Keeping it real.  Russell, homemade wine.  Russell, homemade wine.  I'm good.  You know what?  I got an empty stomach.  Hey, that's going to fill it up.  No, it's got vitamins.  It's got everything in it.  It's got everything. 
[03:07:30]  It's got everything.  Minerals.  Yeah.  There you go.  When you say water makes me rust?  Water causes rust.  Causes rust.  You don't need that.  It's true.  Yeah, you don't need that.  What about the rusty water?  How come Popeye's penis is never rusty?  What?  Because it's always an olive oil.  You're right.  The old school people call it like they see it.  That's the fucking beauty.  There's no...  It's just honesty.  This is how it used to be.  You punish for honesty now.  You punish for honesty now.  It's just honesty.  It's not mean.  Hey, look, the chick is short.  Good point. 
[03:08:00]  It's just funny.  If I said that, it would be all the news to get about.  You, you got it.  You got it.  You got it.  The spotlights up your ass right now, Vinny.  The judge says, 30 years.  The guy gets up and says, well, you're on.  It was an accident.  The guy gets stabbed in the back seven times.  It was a fucking accident.  Bop, bop.  Fuck it.  Russell tried to get in.  I don't know.  I'm just working in.  I'm working in.  Don't worry about me.  He took over the room a half hour.  I like it.  No, sir.  You got the same televisions over there?  What are you watching over there? 
[03:08:30]  I got a little news.  There's TV's all over the place.  What are you watching?  I'm watching the feedback, the phone calls.  You got no fucking video games.  No, no, no.  I shut the fucking thing off.  I pulled the plug.  That kind of gives a shit to him.  Bro, you're back, bro.  I miss you, buddy.  The more I see, the more I get to like.  You know what I mean?  Before, I don't like it too much.  I like it downstairs.  You know what I mean?  I want to come in.  I thought I was going to see a friend of mine, right?  It's a fucking ID, this and that.  I have to lift my ID off.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's a lot of security down there.  What do you got?  You got a luggage? 
[03:09:00]  A couple of bottles of wine.  You got to put it through the fucking thing.  You got to put it through the extra machine?  Yeah, be careful.  Don't spill.  It's fucking on me.  The black...  Vinny took his mic away.  Vinny just tapped out, man.  Vinny just tapped out.  So, Peter, it's got a lot of your life.  It's not going to be fair.  You know, in all fairness, it's not like he said to Tony.  He said something else.  That's it.  That's it.  Uncle Lino's done. 
[03:09:30]  He's done.  What's going on, guys?  Uncle Lino just got cut out.  Come on, Uncle Lino just got cut out.  Vinny took his microphone away.  That was great.  The Jersey Shore is doing great.  What are you doing tomorrow, Vinny?  You want to come to the show?  Yes.  Do you?  What's up?  It's at the Prudential Center.  I might go to SNL, but if I don't...  You can do that any weekend.  You got to get all the stars.  SNL, the Prudential Center.  Oh, definitely.  Are you guys coming?  Guys.  I went to the Radio City Music Hall last year.  It was awesome.  Oh, my God.  I was amazed.  I don't leave my compound out all night.  I know.  I heard.  I just stay out there.  How big is the Prudential Center? 
[03:10:00]  How many seats are there?  Guns, girls, and booze.  We scale the effect.  It's only 10,000.  I'd love to go watch my friend work in front of 10,000 while I'm doing...  No, because I'll hang myself on the way out.  Keith Robinson's going to come and hang out.  Keith Robinson should watch people succeed.  He couldn't be a bigger failure.  Wow.  Yeah, and he's, you know, one of those...  Wow.  Look, Uncle Nino's dying over there.  He wants to see himself.  Shut up, bro.  You put a mic in front of me.  Hey, Vinny, you'll be okay.  The show ends at 10.  You can go back here.  Yeah, Vinny, no excuses.  You're live.  It's Saturday Night Live.  Right, right, right. 
[03:10:30]  What time's your show?  8 to 10.  Oh, okay.  I'll definitely go.  I'm a big fan, man.  I'm telling you.  Really?  Yeah, I don't really...  I'm not saying this because he's my favorite guy on the fucking show.  No, I'm good.  He really is like one of those, like...  Sammy and Ronnie are a couple of retarded people, but...  They really are.  A lot of people say Vinny's the favorite because he's kind of an all-around guy.  He's the normal guy.  Yeah, he is the normal guy in the house.  Yeah, but I'm not mad at Paulie and my ancestry, though.  I'm not mad at them.  No, no.  They're good.  I like the situation.  I like the situation.  It's a lot of validation. 
[03:11:00]  I'm sorry.  Mike came in and he turned out to be really fucking cool.  He was great.  All he does is show his stomach and bang chicks.  That's what I did, too.  He loves himself.  He loves himself.  It's just not as impressive.  Yeah, exactly.  But Vinny's got the big cock.  Oh, you call him?  That's what I'm doing.  Nino, that's the Italian tuna can.  You know he's young because he was able to fuck Snooki.  He's seen the numbers on the condom.  He's seen the numbers on the condom all the time.  I had some difficulty with Snooki.  Oh, were you fucking struggling a lot?  Blame the alcohol.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Not me. 
[03:11:30]  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Trying to get it in.  Yeah.  You couldn't get it in.  You couldn't spit?  Oh, it was too small.  Wow.  And she fucks everything.  Nah, I think he was too big.  She's very compact.  How about the back?  Compact?  Hey, did you hit...  How about the back?  Did you hit Dina?  How about the back?  Did you hit Dina?  Nah, nah, nah.  How about the back?  How about the back?  It was like going in the back.  Hey, how was Angelina?  I don't want to know more about Dina.  Damn.  Did you beat Dina up?  Angelina, I did one night.  I saw that episode.  I wasn't proud of it.  I know, but was it your performance or just her?  Nah, just the whole thing in general.  You know what I mean? 
[03:12:00]  It wasn't like, you know, fun.  What's it like when you fuck a chick and she goes, ow?  I would love to just hear that one time.  I was on her elbow.  On her hair.  On her hair.  Get off my fucking arm.  Then shave it.  It's a great feeling.  I love that feeling.  I love that feeling.  I'm all balls.  I'm all balls.  Are you all balls?  Are you all bag?  All bag.  No cut.  That's the worst.  They expect so much.  It's just like false advertising.  You must be like a hooga bird, eh?  You must be like a hooga bird.  You know what a hooga bird is? 
[03:12:30]  What's a hooga bird?  Hooga bird.  They're about this big and their balls hang this low.  Sometimes they're like, hooga, hooga.  You got a big ball.  I saw that one coming.  I just wanted to hear it.  I actually didn't see it coming.  What a non-comedian I am.  It's to be expected.  I'm talking with my hands now.  What did you do?  I know.  Everyone just turns completely.  Come on.  You know, my middle name is Dominic, so I'm going to use that right now because that's  how I'm feeling.  Hey, Dominic. 
[03:13:00]  Everyone's welcoming our family.  We're not racist at all.  No, no, no.  We're going guys from jail, like, to dinner table.  That's another way of saying that they weren't white, Vinny.  Hey, not even guys from jail, if you know what I mean.  That's Nino Dunson.  Jesus, Vinny.  What's wrong with you?  Has Uncle Nino done some time?  I've been on vacation a couple of times.  You did a couple of vacations?  No, no, no.  Big no, no, no.  No, nothing.  No long trips.  Little appearances.  Yeah, a little appearance.  No long trips. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, you're in there.  A couple of weeks.  A couple of weeks.  Right.  Whatever.  Right.  Right.  They gave me a choice.  They'd go, oh, I'll go to rehab.  So I went to a fucking rehab.  So who cooks?  Is it your mom cooks on the weekends?  Everybody cooks.  My grandmother, my mother, my mother.  They all share.  Oh, I'm a cook.  You tell them I'm a cook.  That must be fucking great.  I'm going to give you a good salad, this guy.  Anthony, no, I would just say I'm a cook.  I used to work in a nut house as a cook.  I used to have soup to nuts.  What the fuck? 
[03:14:00]  Allie.  You've got to love him.  Best job ever had.  I worked in a drugstore once.  I had a part-time job in a drugstore.  A lady, an old lady, comes in.  The service says, you have cotton balls?  I thought, what the fuck do you think?  I'm a fucking ragdoll.  Cotton balls.  What the fuck?  Cotton balls.  What the fuck?  I like that he just takes really old jokes, but just makes them dirty, and it's fun.  I think if you say it aggressively, it's the work.  Exactly.  He can say anything.  It's the way he delivers it.  What am I, a fucking rabbit, you bitch? 
[03:14:30]  It's the lemon and soup to nuts.  Holy shit.  What?  What am I, an ocean?  You're a fucking whore.  Let me tell you, Vinny.  Never take that for granted, because someday, they're all going to be dead, and you're never  going to eat good again.  I won't.  I swear to God.  You're never going to drink good again.  All my relatives, they die off, and they get too old, and you don't get to eat good  food anymore.  It sucks.  I do this old man every morning.  This old man every morning.  He used to read the newspaper in bed.  First thing he read, he used to read the obituaries.  He used to look for his name.  If his name was in our name, he used to get out of bed. 
[03:15:00]  What the fuck?  Every time I hear the N syllable come out of his mouth, they fucking clench.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't like the fuck.  Are you going to fucking take it away again?  The N syllable.  The N syllable.  It's amazing.  Oh, Augie, hello.  It's amazing how people die not for medical order.  Isn't that amazing?  Out on the sidewalk, I found a nickel.  I was in England.  I wore knickers.  Oh, you like salt and vinegar chips? 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  I like Nipsey Russell.  Not a chink in the armor.  He has racist material, though.  It's okay, because it's coming.  I could go down.  Russell.  Oh.  There goes the mic again.  Vinny just took the mic away.  I was going to play Let's Name a Group and see what Uncle Nino's got.  Vinny's got dreams, hopes, and a future that can just completely be destroyed in one 
[03:16:00]  word.  He's got actual dreams before he has to cash in on his cock.  Before porn.  You guys have been around a long time, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Since 1975.  That's what he said.  He used to listen to them.  We're on the way to Bronx.  Back in 75.  On the way to the Bronx, back in 75.  I can only imagine what he's doing in the Bronx.  Hey.  Before Lindsay fucked up this city. 
[03:16:30]  Picking up nickels.  You guys got a nice Opie and Anthony.  It works good.  I'm stuck with this.  Odie.  Ogie.  Ogie and Anthony is pretty good.  Ogie and Anthony.  You take David and Goliath.  Yeah.  Or Samson and Delilah.  You can't change it.  No, no.  None of those guys want to beat Delilah.  No, no.  Sonny and Shea.  Sonny and Shea.  Sonny and Shea.  That's a good one, too. 
[03:17:00]  Peter and Paul.  Peter and Paul.  Another.  How about Mark Anthony?  Mark.  No.  That was one guy.  Cleopatra.  No.  You can make it Mark and Anthony.  Mark and Anthony was one guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was one guy.  Mark and Anthony.  Mark and Anthony.  Listen to me.  Stop pulling.  Let me finish my fucking thing.  Mark and Anthony.  I went to the doctor.  I went to the doctor.  Oh, please.  I went to the doctor.  Dr. Vinnie.  I was there for fucking five minutes.  I was there for five minutes.  He says, you know, it's nothing wrong.  We have a split personality.  Split personality.  I said, Doc, what does that mean?  He says, it's like two different people, you know? 
[03:17:30]  Two different people.  He says, they're like two different guys, you know?  He gives me an $80 fucking bill.  He says, I got $40.  I said, Doc, it's $40.  He said, I got $40.  That's the $30 fucking guy.  What should I pay for both of us, you know?  What the fuck?  I hear you.  I hear you.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Hey, fuck it, right?  Russell, you got to add that to your delivery.  At the Prudential Center.  If you're not taking it, I will.  It really is the fail safe at the end of every one.  What the fuck?  What the fuck, right?  When you see Russell tomorrow night, the Prudential Center. 
[03:18:00]  What show?  I do comedy.  Where?  I don't know.  You're an AM guy or PM guy?  I'm a PM guy.  These are AM guys.  You're my type of guy.  You're my type of guy.  I'm a PM guy.  He's all over the world.  He does comedy all over the world.  He's one of the biggest comedians in the world.  Yeah.  For the world.  Yeah.  So I don't see you.  You don't miss nothing.  You're missing nothing.  You're missing nothing.  Until I start adding in, what the fuck, you're missing nothing.  Does he talk about black and white?  Oh, no.  I say I talk about black and white.  He doesn't say I don't do it. 
[03:18:30]  I like the way you do it.  Let me.  Let me.  I like the way you do it.  Let me.  I don't.  You know, one person's black and the other one's white.  What the fuck?  That's how you do it.  One time me and this, wait a minute.  One time me and this black guy walk into a bar.  It's 1976.  What the fuck?  So they bust his head and troll him out.  What the fuck?  You missed the punchline. 
[03:19:00]  He fell asleep and left the truck parked where the cops could find it.  What the fuck?  Oh, stacks.  Stupid stacks.  Stupid stacks.  Jamie, I don't hear enough of you.  What's that?  Are you Irish?  I'm mostly Irish, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, an Irish guy walks out of a bar?  Yeah.  It's possible.  I got Russell going.  Are we really having Brooke Shields today, Tim? 
[03:19:30]  Oh, I know.  What's your background, Russell?  My background is Indian.  You're Indian?  Okay.  Yeah, Indian.  Again, Uncle Nino.  Indians, you have the real head.  I have a feeling.  I have a feeling.  Nino's pointing his phone at you.  At least you don't die, you know.  At least you don't die, you know.  You know, because you're not a woman.  She could go with his fucking thing.  Oh, am I the fucking PA, bro?  Oh, it's B8.  It's B8?  No, no, no.  Nino needs his own roadie.  No, no.  Dude, Brooke Shields is on her way up.  Oh, no. 
[03:20:00]  This is not good.  We said that would be a nice, normal environment today.  Yeah, it'll be good.  Oh, it's good.  We got Brooke Shields coming to say hi real quick.  Jimmy did a movie with Brooke.  Oh, there's no shit.  Yeah.  She could sit on my lap, you know.  I'm taking the mic away when she comes in.  This is not good.  She's going to change him to panty shoes.  Wasn't she in that movie, Blue Lacoon?  I don't know why that beat didn't happen.  Fuck it.  It's right on the edge. 
[03:20:30]  What are you going to do?  Could be the worst day for Brooke Shields to show up.  It couldn't be worse.  It couldn't be worse if the Wu-Tang Clan was in here.  We're going to sit on the degenerate couch.  Wow.  That is.  She just wants to combine and say hi.  Yeah.  This is pretty fucking cool.  Yeah, she just wants to talk.  I got it.  Yeah.  Jimmy did a movie with her.  And, yeah, and she wasn't going to come in, but I emailed her.  And she said that, yeah, she'll come in.  Because I'm like, it'll be a nice, normal.  We'll have a good time.  And one of the reasons is it is a little. 
[03:21:00]  When she comes in, it's warning me now.  When she comes in, Dallas Marconino is the mute.  That's all.  Hey, look, look, look, he's.  I fucking grew up, though, with this exact same thing.  Uncle Nino, I swear to God.  It's fantastic.  No, I didn't say not.  I swear to God.  It is fantastic.  So fucking take the mic away.  No, no, no, no, no, Julie.  It was just where I'm going to breathe.  You got that big gold crucifix.  I love it.  It's a gold chain in the crucifix.  Yeah, I know, yeah, I know. 
[03:21:30]  Where's your Gorno over there?  No, no, no.  You call him a Gornuto?  No, Gornuto.  He said Gornuto.  Where's your Mama Luke?  This Indian nose.  This Indian nose.  This Indian nose.  And look at this Indian nose.  Hey, fash of the cats over here.  And look at my nose with the nose nose, Julie.  That's all the cats over here.  Oh, shit.  I had this Indian nose.  This is a Sicilian Indian.  Hey.  I'm a Sicilian Indian.  Hey, my computer's broken.  Can you help me? 
[03:22:00]  Holy shit.  Where are I?  Actually, is that Prudential?  That's got to be sold out, right?  Jesus Christ.  Is Prudential sold out?  Can you come tomorrow?  I can't do anything tomorrow.  Actually, tomorrow I got the cash.  Ah.  Good, good, good.  This is not good.  It's great.  Hi, Brooke.  Hi, Brooke.  Hello.  Oh, my God.  It's Brooke Shields.  Give us.  Hello.  Hi, I'm.  How are you?  How are you?  Vinny.  Nice to meet you.  Vinny.  And Uncle Nino.  You're better.  Uncle Nino.  That's Uncle Nino. 
[03:22:30]  Easy, easy.  Uncle Nino.  Easy, easy.  Easy.  Uncle Nino.  Oh, you're ready for a second kiss.  Uncle Nino.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  I said I was Italian.  Part of me was Italian.  Yeah.  Just this part and this part.  Now both cheeks, right?  Because Uncle Nino is very, very respectful.  And Vinny goes, yeah.  That's what I heard.  That's a creepy event.  Don't worry.  How are you?  Vinny goes, don't worry.  That means he's the one worrying the most.  He goes, don't worry. 
[03:23:00]  So this is the preemptive we apologize.  You tried to apologize to me yesterday.  I emailed Brooke like a nice email.  Like, oh, it'll be great.  It'll be nice and normal.  And then yesterday's show got canceled.  So we have everybody from yesterday and today.  And not that we wouldn't be happy to have Uncle Nino in.  Uncle Nino.  But it couldn't be Dino.  We got leftovers today.  Dino.  No, no.  We have everybody from yesterday today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So how are you?  I'm good.  I'm very good.  I was enjoying our emails, our texts.  We were both trying to be very polite. 
[03:23:30]  And I was like, come on.  Who are you kidding?  I thought he was lying when he first said that he was emailing Brooke Shields.  We've had a relationship for a while now.  Yeah.  And then he told me about QWERTY.  Yeah.  I got him.  I totally got him hooked.  She did get me addicted to it.  That started such a fight with me and my girlfriend because she saw your email address on my dresser.  My old email used to be sleep with me.  Oh, really?  Well, I wouldn't blame you for not giving me that one anyway.  No, that's the one I think I gave you.  Because my daughter used to say, Mama, just sleep with me two minutes.  So I thought that would be a really good, very intelligent email to have. 
[03:24:00]  You didn't think of the other direction that could go in?  I was a bit naive.  Yeah, a little bit.  That's where I've been all my life.  But then you changed all that.  Working with you changed all that.  Well, we emailed a little bit and my girlfriend got so annoyed because she's like, what is this for?  And I'm like, why do you have her email address?  I'm like, oh, we're just going to play QWERTY.  And she actually got threatened that we were going to play QWERTY because that was supposed to be like our special thing with me and her.  That is really funny, though, the thought that it's your special thing.  That's our special thing. 
[03:24:30]  But like, you know, you're playing it with Brooke Shields, which is nice and everything.  And she should understand.  How do you tell your girlfriend, like, look, we're just friendly.  And if she wanted to, I'd kick you down the steps, honey.  How do you tell your girlfriend?  There's no way to express that nicely to your girlfriend.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't talk.  Shut up.  We told her to be on his best behavior, Brooke.  They start talking about technology, emails and things.  It causes trouble, right?  Exactly.  You're right.  Oh, back in the old days, you just had to worry about a little lipstick on the collar, right? 
[03:25:00]  You know, right?  Or a matchbook.  Matchbook.  Or a napkin.  A cocktail napkin.  Or whatever, whatever.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  It's not even what time he went there.  I know.  He went there.  Yeah, yeah.  Why do you want?  Do you want wine?  Oh, there's homemade wine, if you like.  He brought in alcohol.  Yeah, that's great.  Homemade wine in a Pellegrino.  That's fancy.  I feel like I have to.  I've been a little under the weather.  Do you think it will help?  Nothing says wine.  Nothing will get you above the weather than this.  Like a twist-off cap. 
[03:25:30]  Did you make it?  Is it in your, like, you did see?  Yeah.  See?  Brooke, do you want some?  I will.  Yes, please.  Yes, she's going to have some.  I'm going to have some.  It's made in a different bathtub than they dismember people, and so it's okay.  Don't worry, fellas.  I'll pour.  And it's wine, right?  It is wine.  It is wine.  I actually have some.  Because it's red.  I've had some.  It's wine.  How do I know?  It's not that it's very...  It's very fruity.  Oh, no.  My cup is there already. 
[03:26:00]  A fresh one.  No, a fresh one.  No, no.  A fresh one.  I'll give you a fresh one.  It's delicious.  It is fruity.  It's sweet and fruity.  And it's not a cousin of yours or anything.  I looked at you the wrong way.  I looked at you the wrong way.  Come here.  We knew you wanted to take a bath.  You know, Brooke was on one of my flights once when I was flying to Indiana.  It was me, you, and Babyface were all on the same flight.  You knew that one wasn't going down, right?  I have a little wine. 
[03:26:30]  And I knew if that plane went down, nobody would have given a fuck that it was on that plane.  I should have a little wine.  She'd be flying with you today.  Hey.  You're the, what they call, passengers and crew.  You'd be in those numbers.  I'd be in some other guy.  Yeah.  You always feel a little more confident, though, when there is a celebrity on the plane.  I always feel like, oh, if there's somebody, like, famous or if there's, like, a man of God.  Like, if, you know, if you'll see somebody with a collar or, you know.  Well, maybe not some religions.  I don't know, but certain things you don't feel so comfortable. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, you're right, because no celebrities have died in plane crashes.  What are you talking about?  It is the dumbest thing, but it does give you this sense of, like, like I was saying the other day.  At least if we go down, it'll be worth something.  Yeah, at least it's going to be one of those newsworthy kind of things and not just anonymous people.  I always feel comforted if I see somebody singing Peggy Sue as we take off.  Hello, baby.  Or Bamba.  Love La Bamba.  Yeah, come on, boy.  I get nervous when I see celebrities on flights.  I really do. 
[03:27:30]  A, I know I'm going to bother them for a photo.  And B, I know this plane could go down.  Think of how they feel when they see you.  Not sexually inspired, I'm sure.  So you wanted to get a photo, but you didn't?  I didn't.  I got one with Babyface.  They were, like, having a power summit in their seats.  And I was like, this dorky guy going, holy shit, there's Brooke Shields and there's Babyface.  I don't know who to talk to.  And then someone said, could you just go back to the girl, so I'll go to Babyface.  You're not really allowed on this side of the curtain, sir. 
[03:28:00]  I was in there with you guys, too.  That was the worst part.  I was sitting right behind Babyface, and I was like, I held my iPod over and go, look what I'm listening to.  I wasn't really listening to him, but I pulled up all the Babyface shit I had on my iPod.  Huh?  See, that would have been worrisome if you had something.  of me to show, like, who knows what they had to do.  That would be too creepy.  But that's never going to be good, you know.  That would be too creepy.  Hey, look.  And it really happens.  I have it on my iPhone.  Exactly.  Really.  You're my screensaver.  Oh, great.  Oh, wow.  That's not awkward. 
[03:28:30]  Not awkward at all.  Do people say creepy things to you, trying to be charming, or just because they don't know what else to say to you?  They're, you, like, no.  I'm right here.  I'm right here.  I know.  He's still in the room.  God.  They say all sorts of things.  Because it's normally people get really nervous, and they'll sort of say something like, oh, my God, you're my biggest fan.  And you're kind of like, yes, I love your shirt.  Because they reverse things, you know what I mean?  Or, like, oh, my God, you are not half as pretty as your pictures.  Holy shit.  And you're like, I know you're trying to compliment me, but you don't. 
[03:29:00]  Well, they think they're saying it, but the word's going to, or I hope, anyway.  Sorry.  Is that a front-handed insult?  Exactly.  Wait a minute.  And Patrice wanted to come in today, too.  That's what you wanted.  I wish he was here.  Yeah, but he couldn't because of the weather.  I think he got stuck somewhere.  He couldn't come in.  I guess we've got to believe you guys.  Oh, like, no, he and I have a...  Okay, here's the...  Did you tell him how I taught him how to dance?  No, I actually did not.  Okay.  I taught Patrice to have rhythm.  Which is terrifying.  I had a rhythm on Patrice's couch. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, I could just see Patrice rolling his notes on the ground.  I broke him down.  I broke him down.  I got smiles out of him.  You see, at the end of that trip, he smiled.  He liked me.  Really?  I wore him down.  I absolutely wore him down.  You're pretty cool for a skinny, you know, white girl.  It took a while to get to that point.  I'm sure he didn't say girl.  No, no, no.  I'm sure he didn't.  Do you think...  No, it started with a V.  Yeah.  Do you think he was a little ornery when he first got there?  He was very ornery.  That's why I told him, I was like, you got to knock off the attitude.  Just knock it off.  I was like, take a direction. 
[03:30:00]  Do it or don't be here.  God damn.  Only you could probably do that, too.  Because you don't listen to anybody.  No, he doesn't.  But, you know, he's just his worst.  He's his own worst enemy.  Like, he does it to himself.  You figured him out so fast, didn't you?  It doesn't take long.  It doesn't take long to figure out that.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Because he's a good guy.  Bridge burner.  Please rules.  He's got to cross him before he burns him, though.  Yeah, that's true.  That's the problem.  He burns him before he even gets to cross him.  He really does flamethrow while the enemy is coming behind him.  It's like, could you get across it first, stupid, and then burn it behind you? 
[03:30:30]  Not while you're standing on it?  No, but it was funny.  I mean, I did get away with a lot.  And not disrespectfully, I don't think.  So I was sort of, you know.  Oh, but she was so much meaner than anybody thought, which was great.  Like, I was standing there.  Like, literally, I was just standing there.  And I was just kind of slumped over like I'll do.  And she stood behind me.  She's like, how do you get your body to do that?  No, I thought it made a character choice.  And I was like, that's genius.  I was like, God, you know what?  I've got to be more physical in my hair. 
[03:31:00]  Some physical acting, yeah.  I was like, that's amazing.  It was perfect for the character.  And he was like, I had, like, scoliosis when I was born.  Yeah, I got it.  I was like, how?  Oh, that is funny, though.  Yeah.  I would have thought you guys would have all hung out and got along.  Yeah, well, her and Brendan ate with the crew.  They were very cool, man.  Everybody was really down to earth.  Like, that's a big deal, eating with the crew.  But I wouldn't if I was in your position.  Believe me, I know, I'm scum.  I would not eat with the crew at all.  I guess there's a misconception about you that Jimmy kind of broke open when he came back. 
[03:31:30]  And talked about it.  From that and talked about it.  But I think a lot of people look at you as, like, very standoffish.  I think what happens is when you're labeled things like America's anything, like sweetheart or  celebrated virgin that has a tendency to put a damper on your social life.  I guess so, yeah.  I think that there is this perception that that is.  I mean, being a New Yorker, a native New Yorker, you can't be that way.  You have to be ready to go with anything. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, you're in with the people no matter where you're going.  You're just, I'm born and raised in Manhattan.  I think it just is a different sensibility, you know.  But also, the guys were so great.  Everybody was such a great crew and such a great group of people.  And so, you get a bunch of comedians together, like, you've got to figure out where your  place is and how you can hang with them.  You define who you are pretty quickly.  Yeah.  And then that's your thing.  You know what I mean?  Like, you're all sitting at the table and everybody's vying for something because everybody's  doing a little bit of their thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And they'll smash you.  And then you kind of just find your place, whether it's self-deprecating or the butt of 
[03:32:30]  someone's jokes.  Like, you choose that position and then you're in.  You know when you say something, too, and you just gave them fuel to just beat you up.  And I'm that girl.  Like, I'm the straight guy and you could just, it's fodder.  And I've been that way forever.  Did she just say that?  Uh-oh, here it comes.  But you've got to do, like, a real good straight man.  I mean, I used to work with Bob Hope forever.  And that was, I was never given the punchlines.  I was always given the setups.  And, you know, you learn to appreciate that.  Well, we actually. 
[03:33:00]  They're saying Brooke has to leave.  Oh, God.  That's up with my wine.  I know.  We've got to plug, what is exactly your, um, you're doing a Feinstein's at the Regency.  Why are you here?  Just saying.  Why are you here?  I want you to plug what you're doing because it's called In My Life where you're going to  share stories about your life.  I've been asked for years to do a cabaret act.  It's not something I'm comfortable doing.  It's not something being, like, front center as me.  I'm much better being, like, a character or somebody else.  But they asked me so nicely so many years that I thought I'm scared, so I have to say yes. 
[03:33:30]  So I'm doing a, it's a, I mean, it's like doing stand-up except song is, and stories.  And they're, it's stories and songs.  But it's also a lot of my Broadway stuff.  But it's stuff that people haven't heard me sing or tell stories.  It's very, you'll have a field day with it.  Are you nervous about it?  Yeah.  I'm, like, throwing up.  Really?  Like, because it's very intimate, you're in a very small room, and you're just you.  You know, and who really wants to, like, come on.  It is a lot easier.  We know, but everybody right now, even hiding behind these microphones, are a caricature of 
[03:34:00]  themselves to a certain extent.  And that's the safety in it.  Except for Nino.  Except for Nino.  That's the real deal.  Nino is.  He's on his best behavior.  I'm on probation.  He's on probation.  He's got man probation.  He's on a lot of talk.  So anyway, it's February 1st to the 12th, and it's a good night out.  It's actually a really fun.  It's one of the most established, sort of, oldest venues in New York.  Oh, absolutely go see that.  It's cool.  Yeah, we'll check it out.  I'll definitely go see that.  Well, let's get her up.  Let's get her up. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, they're all panicking.  They're going crazy.  Brooke's got to go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll probably see you at UCB soon.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  You know, we'll just do a picture when we're on a flight.  Well, actually, it was a.  Okay, yeah.  Just come up and sit right on my lap.  We'll see each other.  We got it.  Why don't we end the show?  It's not even 10, and I just had a whole glass of wine.  I know.  Isn't that great?  Russell Peters is going to be at the Prudential Center tomorrow.  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night.  Some tickets available.  Brooke, you can get at Feinstein's at TheRegency.com for tickets, and Russell's one of the biggest 
[03:35:00]  comics in the world, as everybody knows.  Yeah.  And I got tickets on sale for Vegas and all that stuff.  And Vinny for the Jersey Shore will be banging chicks all over the country.  I'll find a casino in any street corner.  Right.  No casino.  And we're out.  He doesn't remember meeting me.  That's it.  Very cold.  But that's okay.  Yeah, we should end it here.  See my noch shields and Vinny and everybody else.  Bobby Lee earlier.  Holy shit.  Have a great weekend. </pre>
