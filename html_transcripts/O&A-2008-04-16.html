<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an introduction of Leslie Nielsen, who shared a humorous childhood anecdote.  This was followed by a discussion of "Whip them out Wednesday," a long-running segment promoting their "WoW" stickers and its surprising success across other radio stations.  A substantial portion focused on the documentary *King of Kong*, with the hosts repeatedly calling Billy Mitchell a "douche" and criticizing his arrogance and refusal to compete in modern tournaments.  Audio clips of Mitchell were played, highlighting his self-aggrandizing statements, contrasting with discussions of other players like Steve Wiebe.  The show then shifted to a discussion of a New York City subway groping epidemic and the ambiguous definition of "jostling," clarified by a caller who identified as a police officer as pickpocketing.  The Pope's visit to the US was briefly discussed, touching on meeting etiquette and the church's sex abuse scandal, alongside a woman airing her divorce grievances on YouTube. The hosts also mentioned their participation in a Rochester radio competition, urging listeners to vote for their competitor, Brother Weez.

A caller, Tricia, detailed her tumultuous divorce from her wealthy husband, Philip Smith, highlighting a prenuptial agreement allowing his eviction after 30 days and his infidelity.  She also claimed they never had sex due to his alleged high blood pressure, despite finding Viagra, porn, and condoms.  The hosts and callers reacted with varying degrees of disbelief and outrage. This led into a broader discussion on divorce, prenuptial agreements, and the financial implications of marriage, with callers sharing their experiences.  A heated debate ensued between a caller and the hosts regarding the conflict between religion and science, resulting in a strongly worded exchange filled with insults and accusations.  A humorous segment featured audio from Tippi Tom, a recurring homeless character, and a prank involving a female staff member's hat and a Rickroll.

The show continued by jokingly acknowledging their belated participation in the Rickroll meme, followed by listener emails about gay wrestling.  Discussions included New York Governor David Paterson's blindness and audio of his first pitch, mockery of Al Pacino's movie "88 Minutes," and a discussion about Dr. Michael Baden and his involvement in high-profile autopsies.  Jack Cafferty's apology for controversial comments on CNN was played and debated.  The show touched on the FX show "The Riches," and the politically correct term for "gypsy."  Jimmy, a show contributor, briefly left to film a movie, mentioning a forthcoming appearance on *Good Morning America*.  More audio from *King of Kong* was played, along with a preview of Willem Dafoe and Morgan Spurlock as upcoming guests.

Further conversation included the Obama/Osama name confusion and a mock apology; the hosts' political views and non-voting stance; and an analysis of George Carlin's comedy on voter apathy.  Studio guest Rich Voss showed a CAT scan of his abdomen, leading to humorous speculation.  The show discussed Francis Ford Coppola's criticism of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, a programmer's video game marriage proposal lawsuit, and concluded with more jokes and insults directed at Rich Voss. The hosts acknowledged the show's offensive nature before ending with further off-color remarks.

A phone call with Karen from Melbourne, Australia, requesting a 21st birthday message for her son, Mick, devolved into a highly vulgar and sexually charged conversation, including a game of "Guess What's in My Pants," involving Karen rubbing her vagina against the phone. This segment included discussions about Karen's perceived laziness, hemispheric differences, and John McCainâ€™s response to a question about Hillary Clinton. More Billy Mitchell clips and celebrity impressions by Rich Voss were featured. The hosts ended the segment expressing exhaustion and exasperation with Karen.

A later segment heavily featured Billy Mitchell, with the hosts and possibly a producer, Dan, repeatedly mocking him using vulgar and homophobic language.  A video clip of an elderly woman being assaulted was played repeatedly, with the hosts using highly offensive and demeaning language to describe the event.  Jimmy provided various impressions, interspersed with Billy Mitchell segments and the video clip discussion. Rich Vos also participated, sharing anecdotes.  The show mentioned upcoming appearances by Jimmy and Rich, and concluded abruptly due to time constraints, leaving some conversations unfinished and mentioning sponsors such as AshleyMadison.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Best of Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Intimists, DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Did you play Drunk or Stroke?  Ha ha ha.  Okay, Stroke.  Opie and Anthony.  My first time sort of touching a woman.  I don't know what words were you gonna use.  First time you picked a girl's nose.  What happened?  Her parents come home, so we break it all up, 
[00:01:00]  and the dog runs over, and he's just licking, licking, licking my finger.  This is where entertainment is going.  Are you Chris Hansen?  I am.  Have you seen the show?  I thought you were real funny on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listen to me on Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That's a plug you don't really want.  Unbelievable.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's booby day. 
[00:01:30]  It's booby day.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Hi.  Are you ready to broadcast?  Yes.  By the way, I've seen a lot of stickers on the way home.  The wow stickers?  Yeah.  Yeah, something's going on with that.  I think people are finally understanding the concept.  Yep.  I've seen a lot of them.  Fans.  I saw a few tractor trailers displaying the wow prominently. 
[00:02:00]  You know how those truckers love seeing women topless.  And I mean by their torso being cut in half and thrown into a ditch.  Into a shallow grave.  Horrid people.  Behind the rest area in those scary woods.  That's where you should start digging.  Right.  If the authorities are listening.  Yeah, it's Whip them out Wednesday.  We love Whip them out Wednesday.  We came up with this.  God, I don't even know at this point.  Well over 10 years ago.  That would be 30, 40 years ago.  I'm thinking it was about 12 years ago. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, that long?  When we were broadcasting up there in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Worcester.  Worcester, Massachusetts.  Get the wow.  Get it on your car.  It stands for Whip them out Wednesday.  Yes, it does.  Basically, it's Whip them out whenever.  I mean, there are women out there.  They don't want to wait until Wednesday.  We just acknowledge it on Wednesday.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Bring it up.  The wow stickers are great when you're going to the beach.  They're great when you're going to a concert.  Mm-hmm.  Those stickers are great when you're going to a sporting event. 
[00:03:00]  Yep.  Anywhere where there's a lot of traffic, where people are going to have fun.  You're stuck maybe in a line of cars, two cars next to each other, carload of checks, carload of sorority girls.  Right.  Where's that happening?  On the way back from spring break.  Oh, you know.  On the way back from a bachelorette party.  Yeah, you got to pump it up a little bit.  Loose women coming back from spring break.  So I think a lot of the radio stations that we're on, they're finally getting a little more proactive. 
[00:03:30]  They're starting to realize some of these radio stations we're on.  You don't just flip a switch at 6 a.m. and that's it.  You got to work this show.  You got to make it sound a little more local.  Got to make it fit in with the rest of the programming you're doing.  If we're talking about Whipping Out Wednesday, you, the program director, should have a light bulb go off in your head.  Yep.  Where you go, you know what, maybe I should get some of these WoW stickers. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe I should, like, develop sweepers and promos and get the WoW stickers out there.  Occasionally, when we're not being funny, at least you put a little horn in the background, which helps our punchlines.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you're a PD, you should just keep your mic on the whole time and just pump up some of this crap.  Make it sound funnier with some fine production.  Thanks, Steven Spielberg.  Over-the-top production will hide a lot of the mediocrity that happens on this radio show.  We should do that one day. 
[00:04:30]  One day, just completely overproduce the hell out of this and just have just very average material at best.  I know, because right now we have that just without the overproduction.  Yeah.  We're just setting up the show, Jimmy.  We're just setting up the fact that it's Booby Day.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  And we should celebrate that.  Right, ladies?  It's going to be 70 today, too.  Huh?  It's going to be nice.  I heard double sixes, Jimmy.  Well, you know, don't get crazy with this 70 thing.  I heard 68, actually.  I heard double sixes. 
[00:05:00]  Cooler by the shore.  Oh, really?  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  The news is just all over the place today in New York.  They're just coughing through every story.  One of the broads looks like Farrah Fosses.  I don't know what the hell she's doing with her hair.  Farrah hair.  Just awful, awful, awful.  I hear that E-Rock has joined the King of Kong Club, a movie I'm obsessed with, and  E-Rock finally saw it.  It's King of Kong, what?  Fistful of Quarters? 
[00:05:30]  Quarters.  Yeah, trying to get the mouth working still.  My God.  My God, I'm out of here.  And did you like King of Kong, the documentary on the arcade games from back in the day?  Liked the documentary.  Hate everybody that's involved with that movie.  Wow.  Every one of them.  Even Steve Wiebe?  No, except for him.  He's the only guy who you can actually like in this movie.  Yeah, because he doesn't really fit in with the rest of the geeks.  And Steve Wiebe, he lost his job.  He had a couple years to kill, so he decided to go for the Donkey Kong world record. 
[00:06:00]  Uh-huh.  And so he's like the normal one.  And I use that term kind of loosely.  He's the normal one in the bunch.  He's the non-douche.  Yeah, the non-douche.  Did he like Billy Mitchell?  No.  Billy Mitchell could be the biggest douche.  Oh, Anthony saw a part of this, too, right?  The biggest douche.  Yeah, I saw a lot of it.  I saw a lot of it.  What's wrong with Billy Mitchell, Ant?  He's just so...  He's acting like the guy that cured a horrid disease. 
[00:06:30]  Uh-huh.  And how people should look at him like that.  You played a video game, and you did very well.  He set the record back in 1982.  Yeah.  And the record stood for easily 25 years, I guess.  Yeah, it's because he had a good run on the game, I guess.  And no one really cares about setting that record.  So he's had it for all these years.  Yeah, everyone else discovered the Wii, PlayStation, Xbox, so they couldn't be bothered with playing Donkey Kong anymore. 
[00:07:00]  And I love how one of these traditionalists was on there saying how today's games don't match those old games in hand-eye coordination and the skill and talent it takes.  You ever play that boring-ass game?  I mean, at the time, yeah, it was, you know, that was the game.  But you look back now. 
[00:07:30]  With the Atari 6 noises that they made, 6 sounds, it was horrible.  Yeah, the games from the past were...  The problem with the games from the past is you could just memorize the patterns.  That's what it was.  It was pattern memorization.  You can't memorize patterns for the most part in these games today.  Did you see the Ms. Pac-Man little segment there?  And the guy is running through a pattern and just missing the ghosts and everything. 
[00:08:00]  And he doesn't, like, pull back on the stick when he sees ghosts coming at him at an intersection because he knows he started at the right time and all he's got to do is go forward and he'll just miss.  Right.  It's a pattern.  It doesn't even, it's, there's no skill in the gaming.  There's skill in the fact that you have to memorize a long pattern, but so what?  So what is right?  Billy Mitchell is a douche.  I gotta be honest.  You like Billy?  Don't say you like Billy Mitchell.  I'm not going to say I like Billy Mitchell, but I don't, I have a weird thing with him.  Like, I hate him. 
[00:08:30]  Do you have the same agent?  Billy Mitchell once spoke nicely to me at the cellar.  It's like he was, I kind of feel for him because it's like, I know it's stupid, but that's like the only thing that separates him from everybody else.  Like he felt really, I stupid, but that was his whole claim to immortality was being the best at this one stupid, meaningless thing.  And it's the only reason I wanted somebody else to get the title is so he is number two and it's over, Johnny. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Because he set the record when he was a kid.  They show pictures of him.  He's a kid.  Yeah.  I don't think he could set the, reset the record if someone beats him.  I don't think he was more than like 17, 18 years old tops when he set the record.  Yeah.  He looks like a stoner.  Yeah.  Now he's like, he's just creepy looking.  Yeah.  He, what, invented some kind of hot sauce.  He lives in Hollywood, Florida.  He's got a restaurant and when he goes to these conventions with these old school gamers,  he's like, he's like the, the big get, they all, they all, they all freak out when Billy 
[00:09:30]  Mitchell shows up, gather around to watch him play.  The great Billy Mitchell.  And if you watch King of Kong, he refuses to like, uh, uh, he refuses to play Donkey Kong.  What?  Live in front of people.  Cause he probably sucks.  He refuses to be part of the competitions that they have every year.  Yeah.  So you want a little audio Billy Mitchell?  Oh yeah.  Oh, sure.  I want a video in here.  Even though people can't see him, he's just rules.  Yeah.  Well, there's definitely some clips up on YouTube if you don't want to go out of your way and  watch the movie.  But, uh, here we go. 
[00:10:00]  Billy Mitchell's interview.  I'm often asked by people, you know, somebody wants to become a world champion.  What do they do?  And the very first bit of advice I give them is forget it.  I say, um, you don't become a world champion.  It's in your DNA.  I did not love that guy.  He's an ass.  Of course he is.  He played Donkey Kong.  It's such a, it's Donkey Kong, you dunce.  He didn't win the decathlon or something in the Olympics.  It's, it's stupid Donkey Kong.  It's Donkey Kong. 
[00:10:30]  And, and the whole thing where he's like, you, you know what three letters I use?  No three letters.  And, and he wouldn't say it.  Right.  And, and then some, uh, I guess a reporter or whoever it was, documentary guy was like,  all right.  And just goes with his initials.  He goes, no, no.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  Really?  USA.  You know, because if you get the high score, you got to put your three.  Your three initials.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Three initials.  Yes.  Iraq. 
[00:11:00]  But he, he gets upset because he wears patriotic ties.  So that's what you're supposed to know.  What his, uh, his three, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had a statue of Liberty tie on at that point.  He flips it a little and goes USA.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  No, who's worse than Billy Mitchell in this movie is Billy Mitchell's father.  Ugh.  His parents were awful too.  Oh yeah.  Just God awful.  How would you feel if you were his poor parents and you realized you're pumped out of zilch?  Like, wow, that was the highlight?  82?  That was it. 
[00:11:30]  After that, nothing.  He thought he had politician written all over him.  You pumped out a, a Donkey Kong grand champion.  In 1999, it was a race.  It was a quest for what they called the holy grail of video games.  Whoever could do a perfect game on Pac-Man.  Let's start to finish.  Never miss a dot.  Never miss an energizer.  Never miss a prize.  Never miss a blue man.  Two hundred and six years.  Miss sex with women. 
[00:12:00]  And you would achieve a perfect game.  And on July 3rd, after six hours of play and not losing a single man,  became the first person that ever did a perfect game on Pac-Man.  Oh, that's another record he has?  See, these guys, you know, take pride in these weird records.  Yeah.  Not weird, I guess, but they all get together and they're like,  you know, I'm the, I'm the, uh, Qbert world champion.  I'm the, uh, guy, uh, Centipede.  Centipede, that's me. 
[00:12:30]  I, uh, hold the world record for Centipede.  I think he did at one point also.  Oh, Centipede record too?  Yeah, I think he had the Centipede record.  And the other guy that was the liar, he had the record for Donkey Kong.  Who's the liar?  The, the, the blonde haired guy, when they were kids,  he said that he was the Donkey Kong thing.  So they played head to head.  Yeah.  And, uh, he creamed them.  Uh-huh.  Uh, what's his name?  Douche.  Yeah.  Steve Sanders.  Steve Sanders was the, the blonde haired guy.  And, uh, he lied.  And he's the one that hates Billy Mitchell?  He's upset.  No, he's like hooked up with him now. 
[00:13:00]  It's like, he's almost like his agent or manager.  Who's the other guy that hates Billy Mitchell and he's been obsessed with Billy Mitchell  since 1982?  Everyone hates him in the world.  No, that's the steroid dude.  Oh yeah, that guy.  That guy, that started hanging out with Steve Weeby because he knew Weeby could possibly  take out, take out Billy Mitchell in Donkey Kong.  This is the dumbest thing to watch because they're so into it.  Dude, the movie guy, like 96% positive reviews though.  Because no one likes watching idiots, uh, more than we do. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  It's, it's great to, to watch these people and go, oh my God, this was their, this was  the highlight of their life and they're still living off of it.  Absolutely.  Uh, Billy talks about being famous.  This is famous.  I love the, can I say the one thing I love is that he goes, people say to me, what does  it take to be a world champion?  No one says that.  No one.  No one.  Do you think there's one person that ever walked up and go, what does it take to be  a world champion at Donkey Kong?  No, he's like Bob Kelly.  He rehearses those conversations in a mirror. 
[00:14:00]  I say it takes, you know, dude, the heart of a lot.  Shut up.  It takes a lot of quarters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Quarters.  A mullet and no chicks.  It takes a lot.  Yeah.  It takes a lot of quarters and, and, and women not being interested in you at all.  I noticed 14.  I noticed the real lack of women in that documentary.  Maybe it was when I was nodding off a little bit because I did, uh, fall asleep during it.  You didn't see the old broad?  Uh, no.  The grandma that was attempting to set the Qbert world record.  Oh, that, I see. 
[00:14:30]  I missed that part.  Damn it.  See, but there's more goodness for me to watch.  She, uh, they've got her on her plane to, to play in this, uh, competition.  Uh, what was it?  Fun, uh, fun zone or something like that.  Right.  It's in New Hampshire, I believe in the middle of nowhere is where these people hang out and  try to set these records live in front of people.  Oh, well, when Weeby went to that place and they had the signs up on the machine.  Steve Weeby?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it was just like, oh, how pathetic is this?  The little signs. 
[00:15:00]  It was like, uh, setting the Donkey Kong record.  Yeah.  You know, an attempt to set it and I guess they're real, real proud that it was going  to happen at that arcade.  Yeah.  It was little index cards that said like Steve Weeby versus Billy Mitchell.  Yeah.  It was just so, so sad.  Douchey.  Here's Billy Mitchell talking about being famous from the King of Kong.  In the early 1980s, video games were all the rage.  I mean, arcades were everywhere.  Whenever we went somewhere, it was the equivalent of a rock band showing up. 
[00:15:30]  No.  Imagine the publicity of the greatest obsession in the world at the time, video games.  And supposedly the best players in the world were coming.  They were coming to your town.  It was, uh, it was something where there were groupies.  There were groupies?  There were not groupies.  It was not like a rock band.  This guy's got such a distorted memory of what was going on at the time. 
[00:16:00]  Groupies?  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Sean.  How much do you want to bet this douche Billy Mitchell has game over put on his headstone with these guys?  Yeah, he's already got his headstone made up.  Game over.  It's so profound.  Man.  Someone on Instant Feedback.  It's the roadhouse of video games.  This movie.  That's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he's like stupid Swayze being the bouncer that everybody's looking for. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  I want him in studio.  He's the greatest.  Oh, you got to get him.  He, um, rules.  Shuns the press.  Well, Roland, when this movie came out, we all ignored Roland.  And we really should start listening to Roland more.  No, don't get carried away.  All these people were available.  We could have got him on the show.  We decided not to watch the movie when he handed out copies to all of us about six to eight months ago.  And, uh, Billy Mitchell refuses to do interviews because in his mind, he's still the world champion.  Well, I think that we backed Billy Mitchell and should make that point. 
[00:17:00]  Uh, I think that he should know he has a national forum to come on and make that valid point.  All right, let's get Billy Mitchell on.  I get him on.  Now it's all about getting Billy Mitchell on this radio show.  And then finally, he talks about, uh, being famous a little more here.  It was incredible.  It was everywhere I went.  I'll walk somewhere.  People say, hey, Pac-Man.  I'll say, that's Mr. Pac-Man to you.  It brought me more media attention than I had imagined. 
[00:17:30]  I don't think there was a network that didn't call me.  How do you not love this guy?  How do you hate him?  He is so full of himself.  Years later.  Yeah.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Dude, he thought that was interesting that that's Mr. Pac-Man to you.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Uh, that's Mr. Douche.  My favorite character, not character, because these are real people.  Oh, are they?  In King of Kong, you had Billy Mitchell, right? 
[00:18:00]  Uh, all these dweeby geeks just looked up to.  And when they had these competitions, like the, the, uh, the, the public didn't come to the competitions.  No.  They were playing among themselves.  Yeah.  That was it.  And maybe a couple people that stumbled into the arcade.  No one cared.  Because they'd maybe just want to play, uh, uh, an old school pinball machine or something.  Uh, but the disciple of Billy Mitchell?  Oh.  Brian Kuh.  Uh, Brian Kuh.  Billy's prodigy.  This guy would go to the arcades wherever Steve was playing. 
[00:18:30]  Steve Weeby.  And then he'd go to a payphone and, like, he was spying on him and say, oh, he's up to this.  He's still on one guy.  And he'd check in every 15 minutes with Billy, giving him status reports about how he's doing.  Just obsessed.  Uh, and, and, and just loves Billy Mitchell.  And when the Steve Weeby guy was trying to get his record, yeah.  He was just watching over him like a hawk.  Uh, kind of starting, like, uh, little, little conversations with him to maybe throw him off.  Throw him off his game.  Wow.  Oh, that guy was just a creep. 
[00:19:00]  A total creep.  A bunch of asses in this movie.  Yeah, you gotta watch the rest of the movie, Ant.  You gotta watch the end.  Jimmy loves him.  That's Mr. Pac-Man to you.  And he told that like it was an interesting aside.  Yeah.  He's, he's, uh, he's, uh, David Bent.  He's Ricky Gervais from The Office.  Oh, wow.  He's an ass.  A complete ass.  You think he's got a little Ricky Gervais in him from The Office?  Yeah.  A complete horse's ass.  You might be turning me around a little bit.  Dude, he doesn't, he's not mean or hateful. 
[00:19:30]  He's just trying to hold on to this little stupid thing.  I have a weird thing.  He's a fool, but you gotta feel for him.  Yeah.  That's Mr. Pac-Man to you with a red, white, and blue tie.  And he means it, too.  He's not even joking.  No irony whatsoever.  None whatsoever, Jimmy.  You're right.  Billy Mitchell's a god.  Oh, he rules.  Phone number 877.  You just turned me around in 20 minutes.  877-212-0&A.  Just getting started here, but, uh, highly recommend this King of Kong.  It's on demand for the most part on most, uh, on, on most cable, uh, systems. 
[00:20:00]  What do we got, Sam?  Billy Mitchell reads his fortune from a fortune cookie.  Oh, my God.  Sam, just get me more and more Billy Mitchell freaking clips.  Stupid Billy Mitchell.  That's your assignment today.  Have you seen the movie yet?  No, I've seen it on the clip.  Yeah, you really got to see this movie.  I will.  Here's Billy Mitchell, the, uh, world record holder of, uh, Donkey Kong, and they're, they're  interviewing him in this documentary, and, uh, he, he opens up a fortune cookie.  Does this have my name on the back or something?  What does it say? 
[00:20:30]  It says, you have a yearning for perfection.  What, what happened?  It's got my name on it.  What did he say?  Does it have my name on the back of it?  It's got to have my name on it, because I have a yearning for perfection.  Hey, Sam!  He saved it.  Put it in his wallet.  Of course he did.  He's carrying that fortune.  He shows people, you know, my fortune, uh, said today, my fortune cookie.  Yeah.  Read this.  You read it. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Get, um, get Billy Mitchell's, uh, parents talking about how great their son is.  Now, all parents will talk, uh, very highly of their own kids.  You gotta pick, uh, the good thing, and then really kind of just go off if you're a parent,  I guess.  But these parents just take it as far as you can, as far as bragging about your own son  or daughter.  With his awful title.  Yeah.  All right, uh, we're gonna take our first break.  What about when they all had the gamers' lunch at Billy's Restaurant? 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah, Billy, so Billy Mitchell has this restaurant, and it's just a hole in the wall  in Hollywood, Florida.  You're a crap hole.  It's a what?  It's like a Hooters.  It's like a...  Why wouldn't it be?  It's like, yeah, it's like a Hooters without the hoots.  And he, and he, he thinks he walks in there, and it's like, hey.  Oh, my God, Billy Mitchell's here.  His big entrance.  And he sells his...  That's him.  He sells his awful hot sauce that he invented.  They showed footage of him going through, like, supermarkets and Walmarts, pushing all  the other hot sauces into the back of the shelves and bringing his to the front. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  That's perfection.  But I think he's in maybe, like, two stores or something.  Of course.  Yeah.  Anyway, so they had this big gamers' convention in Florida, because now they're getting together  to try to set the Guinness Book of World Records mark for some of these games.  You gotta see the movies for more of an explanation, whatever.  So then they, the gamers all decide they're gonna have lunch at Billy Mitchell's restaurant.  So they all get together, and they push some tables, you know, together, whatever.  And then they freaked out when Steve Weeby, the guy who's trying to take out his record, 
[00:22:30]  shows up out of nowhere.  And all of a sudden, these dweebs and geeks are like, who invited him?  We didn't invite him.  What's he doing here?  I was like, Billy, I swear, he just came on his own.  No one invited him.  I'm sorry, Billy.  They should all just perish.  And then Billy Mitchell, because this guy Steve Weeby was there, hid in the back for  the entire lunch.  He doesn't want to face this guy.  But they're all sitting there.  The one guy's sitting at the table on the cell phone while Billy's hiding in the back 
[00:23:00]  of the restaurant, just telling him what's going on for the whole lunch.  His disciple, right?  Or whatever.  It's not that important.  His protege.  This is not that important.  That's the brilliance of this movie.  Instead of just coming out and talking to the guy and making it a gentleman's thing,  he just hid in the back.  Yeah.  He's a fool.  And there's an official website.  Could you find that?  It's something Galaxy or something, because we'll probably get some good info off that website 
[00:23:30]  as well.  Twin Galaxy.  Twin Galaxy has all the world records.  So you can look up the game and say Q-Bert once again.  I just like saying Q-Bert today.  And then it'll tell you the world record.  Centipede.  And who holds it.  And this one guy, this one guy who works for Twin Galaxy, this poor guy, all he does is  watch video games of people playing these games.  And then decides if they're setting a true world record or not. 
[00:24:00]  Really?  And how he explains all the boxes he has to go through in one week alone.  It's hilarious.  He watches videos of these video cameras on the screens of arcade games just to make sure  that the game is being played.  Yeah, legit.  It's the worst job.  It has to be horrible.  Guy that cleans cesspool with own toothbrush is a close second.  It's the worst job ever.  Yeah.  Let's go to Ted in New Hampshire.  Ted, what's up?  Hey, the Billy Mitchell skit sounds like something from Will Ferrell or Ben Stoker's spoof on MTV. 
[00:24:30]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.  It definitely is like Will Ferrell or, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Or what's the other one we said?  Help me out.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a Christopher Guest type movie.  It does come off like a Christopher Guest parody.  You're waiting for the big...  Mockumentary, if you will.  Yeah.  You're waiting for the big reveal in this whole movie.  Like, okay, this is a goof, right? 
[00:25:00]  They're going to finally admit that it's a goof, and it's never said.  Thank you, sir.  Ted in New Hampshire.  Oh, E-Roc's got a little something.  At the very end of the movie, they go through and explain what everybody's doing now since this movie was shot.  Yeah.  And it says how the old lady still goes around the world competing in Q-Bert competitions.  She's dead.  Yeah.  And then it follows up with her obituary.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Quack, quack.  I'm sorry.  I thought you had the info wrong.  It's kind of how the movie ends.  The old bra that was trying to set the Q-Bert record died before she could do it. 
[00:25:30]  As she should have.  Yes.  God love her.  Yeah.  A little arthritic hand working the controls.  All right.  Taking our first break, I want to say good morning to Boston.  Wow.  They got something going on up there, and we'll explain next.  Here she goes.  Arrivederci.  Yeah.  They got something going on in Boston, and that's all we'll say for now.  But I want to say hi to everyone listening on BCN this morning. 
[00:26:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Q-Bert.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  You got that onaradio.com.  We put a lot of visuals up there for after the fine radio show.  Indeed.  Let's not forget, it's also Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Get those Wow stickers on your cars and your trucks.  Whoa.  Oh.  Is that good or bad?  That sound was never good.  No?  You don't think so? 
[00:26:30]  Maybe you're falling to another board?  I never played Q-Bert.  No.  Boy.  That sounded like someone got a little Q-Bert.  In our lifetime, we went from Pong to Grand Theft Auto.  Coming out, what, next week or something?  Yeah.  The latest installment's going to rule.  Yeah, it looks great.  All right.  Let's move on to other things.  Let's say hi to Greg in New York.  We noticed this as well, Greg, but go ahead.  Greg.  Bring it to everyone's attention.  Good morning, bubba boys. 
[00:27:00]  Good morning, Greg.  Hey, what about the new governor last night, throwing out the first pitch?  What was that all about?  Where did that pitch go?  Once again, for the rest of America, our governor here in New York is legally blind,  and he threw out the first pitch at a baseball game last night.  How does he do that?  Now, in the paper, it looked like he had good form and stuff.  Where did the ball end up, though?  They didn't really explain that.  It looked like it went to the bullpen. 
[00:27:30]  I mean, he had to wind up the pitch, and then it was, who knows where it went.  If I knew that was going on, I would have taken a look at that game last night,  but I'm just imagining that the first ten rows just all ducked just to be on the safe side.  Did he have somebody yelling, throw it over here?  They had to point him in the right direction.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Get him up there, point him, and just go,  All right, throw the ball.  See, I would have just let him out there on his own. 
[00:28:00]  All right, you figure it out.  Thanks, Mike.  Juggie Green!  Juggie Green!  Bunch of catchers all up and down the baselines.  Just everywhere.  Yeah, from first to home and from third to home.  Catchers in a complete circle around here.  Yeah, just in case.  Why not, man?  You're running the state.  You should be able to figure out how to throw the ball toward home plate.  I want to say good morning to Boston.  We were just talking about this awful behavior that goes on in subways, on buses, mostly in Japan. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  In Japan, there's a lot of groping and guys that like to just rub up against women.  Yep.  And to the point where they have special trains in Japan for just women, so they're not harassed.  The trains are so packed over there, too, that it's very easy to kind of rub against somebody.  And not be noticed.  Yeah.  Well, the MBTA in Boston launched an ad campaign, or they're going to, this coming Monday, to crack down on harassment. 
[00:29:00]  MBTA writers, especially women, especially women, only women, by the way, when you understand the next part of the story,  have long complained of a not-so-subtle form of sexual harassment on crowded buses and subways.  Why would they have to say, especially women?  I don't know of one guy that complains about this, unless it's another guy rubbing up against them, I guess. 
[00:29:30]  But if a woman decides to rub up against you on your way to work, how many guys really are going to complain about that?  What about a fiatty?  You're not going to complain.  Even that, you wouldn't complain about.  What if she's stinky?  You're not going to complain.  Stinky fiatty.  I don't know what it would take for a guy to actually complain that a woman is rubbing up against him on a subway or bus.  Yeah.  Yeah, you wouldn't complain.  You'd just be like, hey, pig.  No, I think you would just let it happen as a goof.  I think.  Jimmy, would you?  I don't know, man.  A big sweaty fatty might be a violating. 
[00:30:00]  I might use that as a chance to act sexually indignant for the first time ever.  Like, what are you doing?  That's just not a stopper.  Hey, I have to file a complaint.  Yeah, please.  Well, now T-officials are trying to clamp down on the unwanted physical contact with the new ad campaign.  Here we go.  One ad show a young woman standing on a bus or train squeezed between two larger anonymous bodies opposite the words, rub against me and I'll expose you. 
[00:30:30]  That's kind of double entendre.  Yeah, absolutely.  I get it.  Another ad features an image of a security camera in the words, flash someone and you'll be exposed.  First, while a third shows a woman riding the MBTA alone with the message, I'm not the one who should be ashamed.  Ah, shit.  Oh, yeah, that's going to get to the guy.  Well, you got to do it.  And then the guy will go, you know, I bet the girl feels a lot of shame when I do this.  I better not do it.  Because they're thinking sensibly the whole time. 
[00:31:00]  Right, exactly.  That they're whipping it out and rubbing and doing horrid things.  Well, we talked about this.  I think this story goes back at least a year now.  We had a guy on the subways here in New York, and he was getting away with murder.  He owned two or three restaurants.  Yeah.  The guy was a pretty good businessman, and he exposed himself.  Yeah, a real creep.  And this woman, he was alone with this woman on a train, and the woman pulled out her cell phone, took a picture.  Took a picture. 
[00:31:30]  And that picture ended up on the front page of the paper here in New York.  And everyone that knew this guy knew who it was, and they found him, and it kind of ruined his business.  Yeah.  Did it really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it did.  And then we have here in New York.  Would you order the bisque right there?  Sure wouldn't.  Yeah, you would have to get rid of all cream-based suits.  Ranch dressing.  There's a story in our papers today about two brothers that are kind of doing this crime. 
[00:32:00]  Really?  And the one brother's going away.  He got caught like 50 times.  50?  50 times.  He might do it once as a goof.  How did he get caught 50 times?  I don't know.  They're not in prison.  The cops here in New York said they were well aware of these two.  So his brother's already serving jail time for the exact same thing, and now they're finally putting this guy away as well for the same crime.  Unbelievable.  I didn't realize that.  Oh, here we go. 
[00:32:30]  About two weeks after he was released from prison, Freddie Johnson boarded a crowded subway train in Manhattan and illegally rubbed up against a woman, authorities said.  Johnson has been arrested.  Johnson.  Yeah, exactly.  A staggering 53 times, the majority for groping women on the subway, police and prosecutors said.  In his latest arrest, Johnson was being followed by plainclothes officers who recognized him from police photos.  He was charged with persistent sexual abuse, and if convicted this time, he could be sent away for life?  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow is right. 
[00:33:00]  That's a hell of a thing to go away for.  They're calling him, I don't know this word, R-E-C-I-D-I-V-I-S-T.  Recidivist?  Thank you, Jimmy.  Oh, there you go.  Transit Grinder.  That's what they're calling him.  Transit Grinder.  Basically being called a Transit Grinder.  That's a great name for a message board right there.  Johnson, a registered sex offender, has been convicted at least twice of persistent sexual abuse within the last decade.  Lengthy rap sheet with 30 arrests. 
[00:33:30]  30 arrests for sex abuse.  13 for jostling.  Jostle.  You know that takes place on the upper half.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I think jostling.  You need something to go like boing, boing, boing.  So I think he's jostling women.  He's grabbing a breast, perhaps.  I don't think that's a fondling could be.  I would say fondling.  Well, jostling means he might be like just. 
[00:34:00]  You think that's himself?  Playing with the dice.  Like he's jostling?  Getting ready to roll the dice.  What do you think jostling means?  We need to know what jostling means.  As far as a sexual predator like this on a subway.  Do you think he's grabbing a woman's breasts and jostling?  Or is he doing that to himself?  Is he jostling his goods?  I don't know.  That's a very interesting question.  Maybe we could get a lawyer.  We need to know what jostling means.  How is he used again in this?  Well, he's got 30 arrests for sex abuse and then 13 for jostling. 
[00:34:30]  Jostle.  So I don't think he's touching anyone because that would fall under the sex abuse part, I'm thinking.  So jostling must mean he's just like kind of.  Oh, he's jostling.  He's kind of.  I think he's.  Like I said, he's getting ready to roll dice.  He's doing the old Captain Queeg.  Yeah, there you go.  Strawberries.  I knew there was.  Who took more portions?  He called me names like Old White Stain.  This guy was released. 
[00:35:00]  This is the New York story.  From prison on March 25th after serving four years for persistent sexual abuse, the state  attorney's general general's office had argued that the 49 year old should be confined under  the state's civil commitment law for sex offenders, whatever, which went into effect.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  Well, that's about it for the story.  But they got him and he's going away for a long time.  And this is such an epidemic that obviously Boston is doing something about it with this  ad campaign.  But you're not going to shame one of these guys from doing it. 
[00:35:30]  I think jostling is pickpocketing?  Stop.  Cheryl, Brooklyn, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, yeah, I'm a cop in the city.  Jostling is like another word for like messing with somebody's pockets, trying to get their  pocket.  Really?  Yeah.  Boy, I wouldn't have picked that.  I thought jostling had to be something sexual.  But is he pickpocketing or is he kind of like, you know, going for the grope through  the pickpocketing scheme? 
[00:36:00]  No, no.  It sadly has nothing to do with sexualness.  But I would like to think it's more of a teabagging thing.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Maybe a Trojan War helmet.  Yeah, there you go.  Thank you, Cheryl.  I appreciate it.  All right, guys.  Thanks for listening.  Hey, what do you got there, Thin?  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  Well, it says traditionally, it's the, you jostle somebody and then somebody else goes  into their purse or wall or whatever.  Oh, okay.  The old bump and whatever.  So they're making a few bucks out there while they're also getting themselves excited. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  They just got to eat.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  Hey, why not?  Guy, whatever.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Rob?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I was just listening.  It's kind of scary because anybody who's been on the subway knows if you don't pay attention  and when the train takes off, you're going to go for a dive.  And all it takes is just some self-righteous, insecure pig to say, oh, my God, he rubbed up  against me.  And now you're screwed for life.  You think?  Oh, when that train takes off, you do kind of, if you lose your footing.  Everyone kind of jumps backwards a bit.  I think that's obvious. 
[00:37:00]  You don't grab onto two cans while you're trying to regain your footing.  You're going for the extreme.  I don't think there's a lot of people in jail for falsely being accused of rubbing against  a girl.  I understand the train just took off, sir, but I'm not a bowling ball.  I love your visual.  Just grabbing boobs.  Oops.  No way.  I was going to hit my head.  Thanks.  I thought it was the emergency stop handle.  All right. 
[00:37:30]  Thank you, Rob.  I had no idea this was an epidemic.  No clue.  Dan in Ohio.  What's up?  Good morning, Cleveland, by the way.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, how are you doing?  Good.  You read the guy was arrested for illegally rubbing up against a woman.  What is the legal way to do it?  Yeah.  Well, that's what it says in the story.  Yeah, exactly.  Is there a legal way of rubbing up against a woman?  Maybe there is.  I would say yes.  Maybe they have to explain that.  It's the way to do it without getting caught.  There you go.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:38:00]  Hey, thank you.  Fun shot.  All right.  We got a call from the Mediterranean Sea.  Pat, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to call up and do a faraway phone call.  I'm in the Navy on a ship right now out of the Meds.  Really?  I just wanted to call into that.  Nice.  Look at that.  That is a faraway phone call.  Can you see land?  We can see what we think is Italy, but we're not sure.  Or at least I'm not sure.  You might be seeing Italy. 
[00:38:30]  That's the Staten Island.  Right.  Don't be like garbage scale.  We're going into the Adriatic Sea right now.  How about you don't give away where you are?  And what are you doing?  How about that?  That's probably not smart.  What's your job on the ship?  I'm an electronics technician.  I care of the communications and navigation radar.  And you guys listen to the radio show on the ship or just you?  Yeah, I try and get it patched through every so often through XM Online. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  Through Arms Forces Radio.  You guys are awesome.  What I have is I've got probably like three or four months saved up of episodes on my iPod.  Oh, boy, you're going to be disappointed.  We appreciate that.  Fire off a cruise missile or something.  Yeah, give us a sign that you're actually on a ship.  We're loaded up with Tomahawk missiles.  That's all we got. 
[00:39:30]  Great.  He's telling the position what they got.  We got ships all over the world, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  This is just one of many.  Pretty color.  Pretty color.  Yeah.  Thank you, Pat.  All right, guys.  Keep it up.  All right.  You too.  That's good.  Ship full of Tomahawk missiles.  Is that bad?  They're pretty good, Tomahawks.  Carry nukes on those things.  Hey, the Pope has hit land.  God, am I getting irritated reading this?  Why? 
[00:40:00]  What are you reading?  About the Pope, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Why are you getting irritated?  The Pontiff?  The Pope?  Oh, just enough already.  What to do if you meet him?  Oh, I read that.  That irritated me, too.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  It's on page two of the Daily News.  What to do.  A little advice if you meet him.  Because, you know, he's been making a lot of public appearances.  You can just run up and say hello, I'm sure.  Yeah, right.  If you're lucky enough to meet Pope Benedict.  Well, can I go with that for a second?  Yeah, like they're not handpicking the people that he's going to meet for his entire visit  in this country. 
[00:40:30]  Don't grope him, I would say.  He's going to be online in front of you at Starbucks.  So just in case that happens, they got rules that you got to follow.  It says, this is the etiquette.  Wear conservative dark clothing.  I guess much unlike his.  He's dressed like a dove.  Yeah, he's dressed like a dove, yeah.  He wants us all to dress like the devil as he dresses like an angel.  That's great.  And this is what drives me nuts.  Address the Pope as your holiness or most holy father. 
[00:41:00]  Look, I'm not particularly...  That's what you're supposed to call God.  You're not supposed to call the...  He's not the most holy father.  He's a man.  I'm a man.  My name's Fred.  I'm a man like you.  It drives me nuts.  There is no God.  I would so mess up that rule.  I would easily call him sir or dude.  Sir or dude is not what you call him.  I would mess up, though.  I'm not saying I would go out of my way.  I would be like, oh, I would just panic. 
[00:41:30]  Your holiness?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Because that's how you should address a guy.  Yeah.  You know, the same way you talk to God.  If you're Catholic, you must bow and kiss the ring on the pontiff's right hand.  That's germs.  Imagine the germs hanging out on that ring.  Yeah.  Can you purel's that ring?  I don't think so.  If you're not Catholic, you should still bow and shake his right hand.  But kissing his ring is not required.  Don't offer the Pope a bagel, a slice of pizza, or any other kind of food. 
[00:42:00]  His holiness does not eat in public.  Like, yeah, well, you don't want to see him with something on his mouth.  Of course.  I was saying that Christ did.  He said, no, no, I'll do this when I get back to the hotel.  Thanks.  Sure.  Same thing.  Your holiness.  I get it.  You're perfect.  We're not.  You definitely don't want a picture of the Pope like the poporazzi will take a picture  of him and have, like, a pizza on his cheek, and he'll look ridiculous, as opposed  to when he wears that hat.  Well, they're afraid of being poisoned, obviously.  Oh, is that it, too? 
[00:42:30]  I'm sure it is, yeah.  Hey, have some of this, huh?  Yeah.  Hey there, Father.  Some guy with a hummus cart.  Of course, they're worried about him being poisoned.  Yeah, that rules.  He should be worried about.  Yeah.  Don't offer him a falafel.  Yes.  Anybody wearing a winter coat in June saying the name Allah should be kept away from the  Pope and not allowed to kiss his ring.  Hey, is he acknowledging the priest's sex abuse thing?  Oh, yeah, big time.  Finally?  Before he even got here, he was, I'll say that for him. 
[00:43:00]  He's being pretty vocal about that.  What is he saying about it?  He's finally at least acknowledging it?  Because the church would kind of, like, sweep that under the rug for the most part, right?  Well, yeah.  He's saying it's disgraceful and that he's ashamed and, you know, he wants them out.  But, again, the survivors are saying, big deal.  Like, until you start attacking and going after the guys that shield the Predators.  Like, of course you get rid of the Predators, but you've got to go after the higher people  in the organization that shield the Predators. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  But, you know, he is addressing it.  Yeah, he was quoted as saying he's deeply ashamed of the clergy sex abuse scandal that  has rocked the American church.  Rocked?  Not just the American church.  We've just been most vocal about it, I'm sure.  I'm sure this was going on all over the world.  Well, his quote was, this is unacceptable no matter how cute they are.  That's good that he's finally acknowledging that. 
[00:44:00]  That's a biggie.  Yeah.  For the Catholics.  Kind of nice.  For the Catholics.  All right, we've got to take another break here.  Dude, they've got no choice.  Two billion dollars they've lost.  Two billion?  Two billion in, uh...  That's just a scandal.  Me a bag of shells.  Me a bag of shells.  It really is.  It's a lot of money.  Just dole out the cash.  They don't care.  They don't care.  It's like, uh, Elliot Spitzer.  You know?  They're willing to pay money.  It's prostitution money.  If you really think about it, they're just paying off people to have sex with children. 
[00:44:30]  Lovely.  Let's see if there's anything else in this story here.  Crowds greeted the Pope yesterday when he landed at Andrews Air Force Base.  Later this morning, thousands are also expected to welcome in, in an elaborate White House ceremony.  That's where the Pope is expected to discuss immigration and human rights with President Bush.  Yesterday, he said he was deeply ashamed of the church sex abuse scandal.  It's difficult for me to understand how it was possible to be a priest betrayed in history. 
[00:45:00]  It's a mission to give healing, to give love of the God to these children.  We are deeply ashamed, and we will do all the possible that this cannot happen in future.  This evening, the Pope will address U.S. bishops at the largest Roman Catholic church in America.  Is it just me, or does the Pope talk a little weird?  Yeah.  Well, he's got this accent.  Who does he sound like?  He sounds like every wedding planner in a Steve Martin movie. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, he's got the German accent.  But he's also got a little...  He's got another accent in there as well.  He's got a little lilt in there, you know?  It's a little...  All right, well...  You're holy...  Most holy father?  Most holy father?  I would call him brother man.  How about just God?  Let's just get it over with.  Hey, God.  Yes?  Hey, Lord of lords. 
[00:46:00]  Isn't this kind of against...  Also, kind of against what the whole thing is?  You're not supposed to idolize these people.  And there's going to be this lavish, expensive dinner and appearance at the White House.  He's going to New York to just be...  He's coming to New York to be just revered.  Yeah.  Where he'll go through the streets in the Popemobile, and ooh, they'll love him.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to do that. 
[00:46:30]  Catholic religion is not about idolizing.  Yet, there he is.  He's a celebrity.  He's a rock star.  Oh, they want to take a peek.  They want to take a peek at the...  Well, when you want to take a peek, you're supposed to make a pilgrimage to the Vatican  and watch him come out on the balcony and wave his hand around.  Where you have to, like, squint your eyes and go, I think that's him.  Yeah.  That's it.  Is that him up there?  Because it's not supposed to be about pride or anything.  This guy is like, hey, I'm the Pope.  Come check me out. 
[00:47:00]  I'm on tour.  I don't know.  Pope's dates are all sold out.  Yeah.  They're all fighting for the tour like Live Nation wanted it.  The Pope couldn't get the beacon because somebody was already there.  He's got Kenny announcing it.  Tickets are on sale now for the Pope.  Tickets.  Tickets.  Tickets.  I can't find it.  That would be perfect right now.  See his holiness.  And they have, like, souvenirs. 
[00:47:30]  Did you see the list of souvenirs you can buy?  The Golden Idols, you mean?  Of course.  That's what we're talking about here, aren't we?  Just melt them down and make a calf out of it.  So I can cast upon thee the Ten Commandments.  Damn you, I'm dead.  Let's say hi to Mike in Pennsylvania.  He might have it.  Excuse me.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I hope it sounds like Dr. Strangelove.  It sounds a little bit like Dr. Strangelove.  That's very good.  Very good.  Thank you, Mikey.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  We've got to take a break here. 
[00:48:00]  Anthony, you brought this to our attention.  I did.  I don't really know this one.  Trisha Walsh-Smith makes a YouTube video about her divorce.  Yeah, it seems a little nasty divorce going on.  And she took to YouTube.  I think this is something you're going to see happening a lot also.  People that are pissed at a divorce, I mean, it gets you angry.  Voicing their opinion, which you usually can't do in court, and most people don't have a radio show. 
[00:48:30]  So you get on YouTube and just start bashing your adversary.  And we got the audio.  Yeah.  We'll play it next.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate that.  I got a communique from Brother Weez last night.  My boy Brother Weez is really, really appreciating what we're doing for him.  Rochester is doing some kind of radio competition with a bunch of radio shows. 
[00:49:00]  And we made it to the final four, and we're up against my mentor, Brother Weez.  Yeah.  And I begged, and it didn't work too well.  It's sort of working, but not really.  But I begged our listeners to take us out of the competition and vote for Brother Weez.  Just take us out.  Because I have no desire to be in a competition with Brother Weez ever.  Ever.  Yeah.  And the guy's out of work, and he needs a little bump.  Simple as that.  He needs a little positive attention. 
[00:49:30]  And this would bring some nice attention to Brother Weez, who's sitting out for like, I don't know, ten months.  He can't do a radio show for ten months.  That's a long time.  Not two years, but it's a long time.  It's a long time.  So the race is still close, even though we're begging the listeners to just vote for Brother Weez and take us out of the competition.  And then vote for Brother Weez to win the whole thing.  And then the paper has to write about him, and it keeps his profile up there. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  While he waits to do his next radio show, which will be sometime in the fall.  Love this guy.  And I'm begging the listeners to just take us out of this competition.  It means nothing to us, but it will mean a lot to him in the end.  And where do they go there, Iraq?  Rochester or what?  Rochesterinsider.com.  And vote for Brother Weez.  It's down to four radio shows, and we want out.  We want out.  And someone said, well, how do you know he wouldn't beat you guys fair and square?  Point is, I don't even want to be in that position. 
[00:50:30]  I don't care.  I don't want to be competing with him in any way.  Plus, he would have a tough time winning this thing, because he doesn't have a show right  now to promote the damn thing.  That helps.  So for the listeners that have listened to my request, I greatly appreciate it.  So 877-212-ON-A.  Anthony brought this to our attention.  We got the audio.  Once again, this Tricia Walsh-Smith.  Do we know anything about her personally, Anthony?  No, I don't know who the hell she is, but she's decided she's going to voice her grievances 
[00:51:00]  against her future ex-husband.  They're going through a divorce on YouTube, which is kind of a new thing.  Yeah.  You get there and just, you know, you can't talk in court.  Right.  And like I said before, a lot of people don't have a radio show, so you can't really just  go on like I have in the past.  But YouTube, I mean, it's open to everybody. 
[00:51:30]  So you could bash your formerly significant other.  And they said she might have a problem in court with this.  Like, I'm sure they're going to bring it in and go, look, she was bad-mouthing the guy  and it might not go over too well with the judge, things like that.  But emotionally, I think it helps to be able to just vent.  Are you trying to say a judge is going to see it the guy's way in a divorce case?  No, no.  Are you insane?  I don't see that happening. 
[00:52:00]  Every time we talk about divorce, we get one woman.  Every time, the phones will just light up.  Every guy talking about how they got so screwed over in their divorce.  And then one woman going, well, I was screwed over.  It's like you're the exception to the rule.  Yeah.  So she's taking her case to YouTube.  This is terrific.  And we got the audio.  Trisha explains her situation here.  So my husband is 25 years older than me and his daughters are around my age.  So I signed a prenup and he paid for the lawyer that did the prenup. 
[00:52:30]  And apparently there's some clause in this prenup that he's got a thing that he can throw me out in 30 days.  But he has to have grounds for a divorce.  So he has no grounds for a divorce, but he's still trying to throw me out of our apartment in 30 days for no reason.  How about?  I don't know why.  But if he doesn't like you.  Yeah.  How about you just suck now?  How about you're a bitch?  How about plenty of reasons?  Grounds for divorce. 
[00:53:00]  Well, you need some legal grounds.  Oh, boy.  And she had, you know something?  She had signed a prenup.  Yep.  Get out.  She signed the friggin' prenup.  And it says in the prenup he could throw you out in 30 days.  There you go.  End of story.  End of story.  I hope he makes his YouTube video.  Figured I'd phone it in.  So I did.  End of story.  And, you know, so it looks to me like this woman had no recourse because of the prenup, but to go on YouTube and bitch about the guy. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  I said, Philip, would you please check out my prenup?  Because when he dies, I get a pension, half a million a year for the rest of my life.  And I get our apartment in Florida.  So I said to him, what happens to my pension if you have a stroke?  And he said, it kicks into my bank account.  And I said, well, your daughters will be controlling the bank account because they get this apartment, the nine-room Park Avenue apartment, and they get all his $60 million estate. 
[00:54:00]  So I said, would you please make sure it kicks into mine?  Anyway, he wouldn't.  How much do you hate this woman?  This bitch!  Boo-hoo!  What if he has a stroke?  Why should you get it and not his daughters?  Yeah.  What did you do?  $60 million.  There's an apartment on Park Ave. 
[00:54:30]  This guy's loaded.  $60 million.  Yeah.  Huge place on Park Avenue.  This guy decided to get a young broad.  Younger broad.  Wow.  Wow.  She shouldn't get it.  Get out of the apartment, you squatter.  Beat it.  Hope this isn't me from the future.  What do you mean?  No.  No, she's 25 years younger.  You'd never come that close.  Trisha talks about their sex life. 
[00:55:00]  Uh-huh.  So I went off to London.  I tried to start my life again, start my career again in London.  He wants to give me nothing.  This is the president of the Schubert Organization.  I'm an idiot.  I am the biggest effing idiot in the world.  Oh, another thing.  We never had sex.  He said it was because he had high blood pressure and he was older than me and I accepted that.  Then last year when we went through this, I found Viagra, porn movies and condoms.  So maybe I should call him up and ask him, just tell him we're filming and ask what he wants me to do with the condoms. 
[00:55:30]  Condom.  Condom.  Yeah.  A condom.  He was banging broads behind your back.  Yeah.  Oops.  You don't watch porn and use condoms at the same time.  Yeah.  You do that when you're...  Figure it out.  Your awful wife can't get the job done.  Surely he tried a few times.  He's like, wow, she's a lot younger, but boy, she stinks at this.  Too much teeth, Nazi voice.  Was it London?  Yeah, English accent or something.  You're a Nazi who lives there now. 
[00:56:00]  He's snuck in the 40s.  You think this guy liked, I don't know, sushi?  Sushi?  Sushi.  He might have liked some sushi.  With wasabi?  With the powerful wasabi.  Wow.  Oh.  What a bitch.  So she goes to England to get her career going again,  and she's all pissed because I've got nothing.  I've got nothing.  Well, that's what happens. 
[00:56:30]  Where's this...  What's this entitlement to getting something?  I don't get it.  I don't either.  I mean, you've been through it, unfortunately.  I don't get it.  Why do you have to take care of the broad for the rest of their lives?  Because the marriage fell.  I don't get it.  And she wants the crap after he's dead.  Especially in the year 2008.  After he's dead.  She wants a half a million dollars a year for the rest of her stupid life. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  And she wants this and her...  Why should you get anything?  It should kick into my account.  For what reason?  Why?  The marriage is over.  You even said you didn't have sex, so it wasn't even like,  all right, well, you gave that up for him.  That's like having a...  So what did she do?  Oh, that's like having a roommate because they didn't have sex.  It's like having a roommate.  It doesn't work out.  Roommate leaves and now wants you to take care of her head.  Like, I'm going to take my milk crates and shelves and half a million dollars. 
[00:57:30]  And the shag rug.  The shag rug.  That I found on the side of the road.  I'm taking the big electric company spool we used as a table.  Oh, God.  Die already.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, I was just listening to this lady babble.  This is the reason that husbands kill their wives.  She is the ultimate reason why.  No doubt about it.  It's the reason why guys kill their wives.  It's the reason why guys stay married and just cheat for decades. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Because they don't want to lose half of everything because the marriage didn't work out.  That's the saying, cheaper to keep her.  Exactly.  So you do whatever you can on the side and you stay married to the pain in the ass.  Wow.  That's the choice men have in the year 2008.  You get married and now it's a lifetime commitment.  You know?  And this is with a prenup, people.  This is with a prenup.  Yeah, but she's not getting away with anything.  She's got a YouTube video.  It sounds like the guy's going to do just fine in the end. 
[00:58:30]  She's still got to pay for her court costs.  I mean, is this just a big waste of money that has to go down?  What does this broad look like?  She looks pretty good, actually.  Does she?  Yeah, she looks all right.  Yeah, she's good looking.  He's probably in his 50s.  Yeah.  All right.  Philip's on a conference call.  Yeah.  Listen to what this bitch does next in this YouTube video.  Her name's Tricia.  She calls her husband Philip Smith's secretary.  I don't really understand what they wrote here. 
[00:59:00]  Tricia calls her husband, Philip Smith's, and then his secretary, maybe?  Maybe there's a three-way here?  Oh, yeah.  Let's see what this is about.  Betty?  All right.  Philip's on a conference call.  Yes.  I'm filming at the moment.  We're doing a video for YouTube.  I don't know if you know, but you know, Philip and I never had sex, but he's got Viagra  and condoms and stuff here and porn movies.  Just ask him what he wants me to do with them.  Would you?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hmm?  You want me to ask him just now? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just ask him what he wants me to do with the condoms and the porn movies and the Viagra.  Does he mind?  Does he mind what I do with his condoms and stuff?  We're just talking about, you know, the fact that there's no sex life.  Okay.  And that he's trying to throw me out of the apartment.  She's trying to get to him with that?  Yeah.  The guy sounds like a rock star.  He's an older guy.  He's got Viagra.  He's got condoms.  He's got porn.  She's grabbing his clothes.  He's actually a younger broad somewhere.  He's just, he's living the life. 
[01:00:00]  She's grabbing his straws.  And it's so great.  He's way older than her.  Yeah.  Can we picture them together, Irog?  Right there, huh?  Oh, my God.  She's got kooky eyes, too.  What do you mean kooky eyes?  Look at her eyes.  Is she a little crazy?  Well, you can see the entire white.  Oh, right.  Okay.  So she's a little crazy.  That's supposedly a sign of kookiness.  You don't have it, Jimmy.  I know.  I have cute eyes.  I was looking, though.  Let's say hi to Brett in Wisconsin.  Brett, what's up? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Right in the beginning there, how come she laid claim right away that limey bitch said,  my half a million dollar pension?  Yeah.  Yeah, she looks at it as her pension.  Hers.  What the F?  What'd she do for it?  What the F?  Who the whatsy?  Yeah.  Right on.  All right.  Over out.  All right.  She just sounds...  I think this YouTube video just kind of backfired on her, right?  Makes her look silly.  Because when you were telling me this story earlier, I'm thinking, oh, man, this poor woman 
[01:01:00]  pleading her case.  She's...  No.  She's making herself look like the big C right there.  She's another one.  And then she wraps up her video with this.  So that's basically it.  This is my home, or was my home, which I'm being evicted from.  In 2008, can you believe?  Yes.  My husband has no grounds for divorce, and he's trying to evict me for $750,000. 
[01:01:30]  I live...  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Then he tried to hack my computer.  I had to get the computer out of the house.  I've had a really, you know, horrible few years.  Oh, I bet you have.  I bet you had a horrible few years living in the lap of luxury.  Jesus Christ, this, this, this...  Look at her.  She looks like a kook.  She looks crazy. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, Brian in New York writes, and I got a correct...  Not even correct.  I got to explain myself.  Opa just said marriage is now a lifetime commitment.  Wasn't it always supposed to be one?  Yeah, but I think there was a day where you could kind of get out of marriage.  How important is the lifetime commitment?  Without losing half of everything you got.  Yeah.  That's what I...  I mean, if you talk to people that are in miserable marriages, they'll tell you, I can't get a divorce.  I'm stuck with this woman for the rest of my life because I can't afford to be divorced. 
[01:02:30]  The thing is, the prenup says he can throw her out in 30 days, and that's what he's doing.  Sorry, you signed it.  Exactly.  Goodbye.  Should have got a lawyer friend to do it for $1,500, just take a quick peek.  Yeah.  See if there's anything in there you didn't like.  Yeah, you could have said, why can you throw me out?  And you have to say condoms properly.  Condom.  Yeah.  Condoms.  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike, what's up?  What's up?  Mike. 
[01:03:00]  What's up?  I was probably saying that he probably kicked her out in 30 days because he's tired of getting  woken up by the woman from 1984.  Smith!  487 Smith!  Wow, nice reference.  You get reference of the day, my friend.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Lynn listening in Buffalo, the home of Shred and Reagan on the Edge.  What's up, Lynn?  Hey, guys.  You guys are awesome.  I'm just calling because you know what?  I'm going to do the same thing right now, and I was going to give him everything. 
[01:03:30]  All I wanted was joint custody.  I'm entitled to maintenance.  I'm going to tell him a half of everything, but I wanted nothing because when you get  married, you marry people because you love them.  It didn't work out, and he had to be a dumb a-hole and not do joint custody.  We're both good parents, so now I am going to court and spending all this money for no  reason.  It's retarded.  I see.  Kids.  That's what woman gives me on everything.  I wanted to give him everything.  I didn't want the house.  I guess you do all right for yourself. 
[01:04:00]  The other thing that I've learned, talking about people that go through divorce, is that  they spend a ridiculous amount of money on lawyers because their emotions get in the  way.  If you start adding up all the money you're spending on the lawyers, it's like, wow, we  should have probably just figured this out ourselves.  No, but there's spikes.  All I had to do was sign the paper, have joint custody, no child support, no nothing, and  be done with it.  Yeah.  But no, now he wants to fight because he's mad because I'm leaving him, and it sucks. 
[01:04:30]  I agree.  Mm-hmm.  It does suck, but you know what?  He could have had everything.  He didn't have to give me nothing.  Well, now I'm going to go to court, and I'm going to try to get half of what it is because  it's been 13 years.  You cannot go through one of these divorces without emotions taking over common sense.  Common sense would dictate you would sit in a room with the bitch or the bastard that  you were married to and try to hash out a reasonable settlement between reasonable people. 
[01:05:00]  But the lawyers get your ear.  It doesn't work.  The lawyers get your ear.  Once a lawyer is involved, then the other party has to get the lawyer, and then you're  not even allowed to talk to each other anymore.  The lawyers love just cha-chinging up the fees, and you end up looking back going, oh  my God, I've spent that much on lawyers.  There's not even a light at the end of the tunnel.  It's ridiculous.  Are you allowed to or want to tell us how much you've spent on lawyers for your divorce? 
[01:05:30]  A ballpark figure?  I don't think I can.  Or is that too personal?  I don't think I can.  I'm not sure.  And that's another thing.  You can't even talk about stuff.  Was it more than $500?  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Safe to say it was quite a bit.  It was a lot of money.  Let's safely say that it was more than probably 99% of the people in this country make a year.  Yeah.  $40 million?  Exactly.  You hit it right on the nose. 
[01:06:00]  Let's go to Melanie in Boston.  Melanie listening on BCN.  I don't know what the hell you were listening to, Melanie.  Listen to this lady.  Go ahead, Melanie.  Hey, I'm all about equality, however.  I mean, the dude kind of deserves it.  Go for somebody your age that's got more maturity.  See, that's not good because then the body is all ravaged.  Hey, there's nothing wrong with older women.  No, see, you need an ass like a snare drum.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:06:30]  We're taking a look at this guy, and his picture will be up later on onaradio.com.  I'm trying to see the female equivalent of that guy.  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  Yeah, he really is a mess.  I can't even imagine the female equivalent of this guy.  He's got turkey neck.  Like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, he definitely went for the trophy.  Yeah.  But again, you know, the prenup was in there, so he probably knew, hey, I'm getting this trophy. 
[01:07:00]  I could take her around.  And it all depends on the woman, too, because a little something about me, I got a little crush on Lauren Hutton, and she's in her 60s now.  Sorry, Jimmy, to disappoint you, but I really do.  So, you know, you get a little older, and your wife's looking like Lauren Hutton.  That could be all right.  That wouldn't bother me as much as if you said Timothy Hutton.  That's great.  You take her to bed, you think those rosy cheeks are from her enjoying the sex, and it's just hot flashes. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, God.  Back the KY truck up.  Let's say hi to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I just turned on my radio, and I thought you were talking about me.  I just divorced a woman two weeks ago from England named Tricia, and it just kind of freaked me out.  Oh, really?  She tried to take every bit of my money.  So, yeah, stay away from the English ladies, boys. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, they're big trouble.  Thank you.  We got Stephen Boston.  A lot of calls from Boston today.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to ask you a favor.  You know, all the beef you do on the show with, you know, the language, which, you know,  most people probably wouldn't find offensive, but the stuff you let through, like, you know,  taking the Lord's name in vain, I was wondering if you could do me a favor and try to avoid that,  because that's usually when I have to turn it off.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  When do we use the Lord's name in vain?  Are you being serious, Ed?  No, God damn it. 
[01:08:30]  I'm not being serious.  Jesus Christ.  You're like that.  Come on.  Why the hell would I give a flying F?  Are you a churchgoer, Anthony?  What?  The magical zombie god?  We have...  That came back to life in three days?  We have churchgoers that enjoy this show.  Sorry.  Why do you have to say his name?  If you don't believe in him, why do you have to say his name?  Because I could say Jesus...  You wouldn't take your mother's name in vain.  What?  I wouldn't take your mother's name in vain. 
[01:09:00]  This is a test of the emergency alert system.  This is only a test.  This concludes this test of the emergency alert system.  If this had been an actual emergency, the tones you just heard would have been followed by additional information or instruction. 
[01:09:30]  We now return to your XM programming, already in progress.  The faith with anything else, so I can't buy it.  Hold on.  Science is just as much of a religion.  No, science is science.  It's based in fact, not faith.  Stop it.  It's a religion.  You put your faith in it.  No, you don't.  You put your goddamn reason and logic into it.  It has nothing to do with faith. 
[01:10:00]  What?  You believe in black holes?  No, that is a theory.  Yes, it's a proving.  It's also a, it's not a proven, it is still theoretical.  They have photos of the energy around what is a black hole, so they know they exist.  And if you can't see the difference between, no, no, I'm not going to let you jump over that.  How about evolution?  If you can't finish the, if you don't know the difference between believing in a God that is possibly existing and a scientific thing like a black hole, you're just reaching for argument points.  Yeah.  Do you believe, do you believe the earth is billions of years old? 
[01:10:30]  Yes!  Prove that.  Prove it?  Prove that.  You put your faith in scientists.  With, you're a, you're a religion.  I've put my faith in, in, in scientists' facts and research that they have done and proof.  There's no proof that, that shows your religion or anyone's religion is true.  There's no proof whatsoever.  Okay, but if you believe in that, and other people believe in this, you know, let's, let's call it, okay.  No, where's your facts? 
[01:11:00]  Show me one fact that, da, da, Jesus was the son of God and rose after three days after his crucifixion.  Show me one fact.  Okay, Our Lady of Fatima appeared in 1917 in Portugal.  70,000 people saw the sun moving around in the sky, and, including skeptics.  What?  70,000 people, look up, Our Lady of Fatima, 70,000 people, including skeptics.  The sun moved around in the sky?  The sun moved around in the sky.  Do you understand that, that, it does, it can't happen? 
[01:11:30]  The sun doesn't move around in the sky?  It's set there in space, and we revolve around it once a year?  It was a miracle.  That's why it proved the Catholic faith.  You sound like a child.  No, you do.  You're, you're buying a, watch Lord of the Rings.  Watch Lord of the Rings, and take that as, as gospel.  Why don't you believe in Zeus?  Why don't you believe in Zeus?  Nobody saw, nobody saw the creation of the earth billions of years ago, but you believe it.  They're taking photographs of it back in time.  They're going back in time with the Hubble telescope, taking photographs. 
[01:12:00]  What about?  And they're theorizing about it.  What about dinosaur, what about dinosaur bones, fossils?  Yeah, dragons.  Every, every culture has had, talked about dragons.  Wait, wait, dragons?  No, no, they're talking about legitimate prehistoric animals that lived on this planet millions of years ago, my friend.  Millions of years ago.  You put your faith in scientists to believe that.  Yes, they've, they've tested it with, uh, uh, carbon dating at first, and now they have more accurate ways of testing how old something is based on, based on the molecular breakdown that they know how long it takes for, for, uh, things to break down on an atomic level, and they can get the date and, and tell the age. 
[01:12:30]  They can say, they can get the date, they can know.  What are you talking about?  You're talking about a book that, that's, uh, a second, that's written by people and then taken and retranslated 80 times, and you take that as, as.  You're talking about your faith in the holy scientists of your science. 
[01:13:00]  Not the holy, don't try to turn science into religion, you dummy.  It is a religion.  It is not, douche.  You're trying, you're trying to discount it by putting it into the same fantasy world as religion.  That's what you're doing.  It absolutely is.  It is not, dummy, it is not.  Science is based in fact and, and proving theories, proving theories through experiment and research and coming up with fact, and your religion is based on nothing but complete faith, period. 
[01:13:30]  It's fact, 70,000 people, I mean, that's.  Stop with fact, it isn't, show me a picture.  Show me anything that would prove that the sun could move around the sky.  You sound, you do, like a child.  Like a child.  It's some fantasy from a goddamn science fiction movie.  Wait, you want to fact, you can go look at the incorrupt bodies of saints that haven't corrupted, defied.  Oh, like King Tut?  Because they mummified it?  Who cares?  Go look at the bodies yourself, you ghoul. 
[01:14:00]  Nobody wants to go, the saints, what, the miracles they performed?  Stop it.  Oh my God.  Stop it.  I want to believe in dragons.  Don't take the Lord's name in vain.  You just said, oh my God.  Yeah, the sun was bouncing around the sky.  And dragons.  Was there a man with a sled and reindeer in front of it?  I want to believe in, I want to believe in dragons and Harry Potter myself.  Dragons?  I like dragons.  Yeah, that's what dinosaurs were.  Dinosaurs were animals that lived on this planet before they were driven to extinction and replaced by other animals. 
[01:14:30]  That's how this planet is, that's how it works.  That's how it's been inhabited.  What's the science priests have told you?  The bottom line is this, don't try, dude, I see what you're trying to do.  It's not working.  You're trying to take science and turn it into this fantasy world that religion is based on.  If you want to have your faith, I have no problem with that.  But don't try to turn science into this fantasy world that you believe in. 
[01:15:00]  It's more of a fantasy world.  No, it isn't more.  How is it more when there's not one thing, there's not one thing in religion that can be based in fact,  and there is plenty of instances in science where research has led to fact-based conclusions?  Not by you, but by the science priests.  Science priests.  Shut up with the science priests.  Don't try to put it in the same category.  You're an idiot. 
[01:15:30]  This is how religious people, by the way, because you've gotten your ass kicked in every argument you've ever had.  Right.  Because there's no proof.  So what you try to do is you try to put them on the same playing field.  Science priests, you know the difference.  Anyone in organized religion knows the difference.  You're being disingenuous by saying that.  You know it's not a religion because they're constantly disproving theories and revamping theories as well.  The Catholic Church hasn't changed anything in hundreds or a couple thousand years.  So stop it.  Stop it.  Do you believe there are planets? 
[01:16:00]  Why would it change anything?  Do you believe there are other planets?  Other planets.  Yeah.  With life on them, not with people on them, no.  No.  Okay.  Well, I won't even get into that because it can't be proved.  And you think the Earth is 6,000 years old?  But you think the Earth is 6,000 years old?  The dinosaurs are dragons.  Absolutely.  Of course.  How?  Of course.  How can you believe the Earth is 6,000 years old?  Because there's no recorded history before that.  Because a lot of scientists have said that, have recorded that throughout history.  No, they haven't. 
[01:16:30]  No, they have not.  Don't you look at...  How about sedimentary rock?  How about fossils in sedimentary rock?  How about fossil fuel that came from organic material that needs a lot more than 6,000 years to produce oil?  How...  Like, these are things that are fact.  According to scientists.  How do you know they need more than 6,000 years to produce that?  According to the scientists, what they've told you?  Jesus.  Because it has been theorized about and then proven, and the theory is...  Hold on, hold on. 
[01:17:00]  I'm answering your question.  Because it's constantly tested and retested by people that don't philosophically agree,  and they're all coming to the same conclusion.  You can take scientific...  Hey, dude, let me answer your question.  You can take scientific equipment and prove that organic material needs a certain amount of time  under pressure and heat to turn into fossil fuel.  It's proven!  Oh, so you know people who have proven it...  Yes, scientists that put out research papers based in fact, not a Bible, 
[01:17:30]  with stories written thousands of years ago by people and then translated second and third  and 80 hands down the line by human beings, not holy people, about magic.  It's a magic book!  It's a Harry Potter book?  It's a Harry Potter book, the Bible.  Yeah, yeah.  God is into wizards?  Dude!  Voted on by that group 300 years later. 
[01:18:00]  Jesus was a wizard.  They were practicing wizardry, sir.  I want to believe in dragons.  What's that?  What?  Hold on, the Bible is not one book.  I know that's stupid.  It means many books.  A bunch of stories voted on.  I know that.  Right.  It's written by a whole bunch of people who recorded a whole bunch of things.  All right.  Yeah, they voted on the most popular readings 300 years after Christ's death,  and they made it a book.  We get it.  We know that.  Okay, so the thing is, you can't point to it as one book and say dismiss it.  It was recorded by a whole bunch of people. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And that's always been accurate, sir?  When a whole bunch of people get their hands in something and translate and interpret things?  They lied about the color of Christ.  Look, I'm...  Don't you say Jesus was black.  I'm going to get on this guy's side.  I'm going to solve this whole argument.  I'm going to use my powers.  I am going to let everyone know how old the universe is.  I'm just going to be looking at a black hole,  and I'm going to read the age by looking at the taint of a black hole. 
[01:19:00]  I've never heard of a taint of a black hole.  I want to believe in dragons.  I believe in dragons.  Imagine Jurassic Park if it was about dragons.  Dragons.  How old that movie would have been.  Can I have a sound of a dragon or a monster?  How old are you, dude?  Yeah.  See?  Yeah.  I'm 38.  Oh, and you brought the church and CCD your whole life,  and you grab onto everything they told you,  and doesn't it bother you that, like, Muslims and other groups are as strong in their belief as you are, 
[01:19:30]  and one of you has to be wrong?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I know I'm right.  Of course you do.  How do you know you're right?  Of course you do.  But how do you know you're right when everybody else in all these other religions actually believe?  That's it all.  And only the Catholic Church.  No, how do you know you're right?  Yeah, how do you know you're right?  Have you ever read the Koran?  Have you ever read the Torah?  I wouldn't bother.  It's kind of, it's crap.  What about the Torah?  But following your logic, you're using the same technique with my pal Anthony here.  How do you know the Koran is crap if you've never read it? 
[01:20:00]  It was every other book.  It doesn't matter.  No, it does matter.  You can't just throw that to the side.  How do you know you're right?  You haven't done your homework, little boy.  How do you know your religion is the right one?  I'm using your logic against you.  Like, you can't just say it's crap if you've never read it.  It's the same thing with people that say, we live in the greatest country in the world,  and most of these people have never been anywhere else to prove that we live in the greatest country in the world.  Yeah, how can you say that, sir?  You can't just say that we live in the greatest country in the world. 
[01:20:30]  I want to hear this guy's answer.  You've never read it.  I want to hear his answer.  Why do you think your religion is right?  Because it stood the test of time.  It's the oldest religion.  It has all the truths.  I mean, you test it, and it's true.  Test what?  How do you test it?  How do you test it?  What do you need to test it?  You said you test it.  How do you test it?  You say it stood the test of time.  What?  It's the oldest religion in the world.  Have you seen miracles? 
[01:21:00]  I've seen incorrupt bodies of saints.  Yeah.  What the hell is that, by the way?  And they look like they're sleeping.  They're not mummies.  Well, they are.  They're dead.  They're not sleeping, so they're dead.  Have you seen the Virgin Mary in a piece of toast yet?  No.  Oh.  All right.  Has it feel that the same people are teaching you all this and that you're believing it  are the same ones that are covering up and paying out $2 billion to molesters?  No, no.  I'd like to know, honestly.  Huh?  Those people, they're not Catholic.  Yes, they are. 
[01:21:30]  And why is the head of the organization addressing it?  Right.  He's not the head of the Catholic Church.  That's a new religion that was started in the 60s.  It's a different church.  Groovy.  The Pope is the head of a church at the start of the 60s?  You don't pay any attention to what the Pope says?  He's not the Pope.  It's a different church.  Then who's the Pope?  I follow the new church with the new mass, traditional Catholic, Latin mass and all that.  So what do you follow? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, where's the other guy?  Like, what church do you go to?  Where's the other guy?  Where's your Pope?  Yeah, who's your Pope?  We don't have a Pope right now.  The last Pope died in 1958, Pope Pius XII.  Oh.  And since then...  What about Harry Potter?  Oh, you like one of those...  He's got a shot.  Are you like a fundamentalist?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  What are you doing listening to this show and getting offended, dude?  It's silly.  Yeah, Steve, go away.  You know what?  You guys are funny.  Why would you tell us...  Go away, Steve.  We make fun of everything.  And we say, God damn it, you don't like it.  Don't you think you're being a bit of a self-righteous ass? 
[01:22:30]  No.  Do you remember how I started off the conversation?  I asked you nicely.  Could you do me a favor?  Yeah, we said no.  Yeah, and I'll say nicely, no.  I'll keep saying, God damn it, and Jesus Christ, and stuff like that.  We have to take a break.  God damn it.  All right, Steve.  All right, Steve.  All right, Steve.  All right, Steve.  All right, Steve.  Who cares?  All right.  Go ahead.  I didn't even have a pope.  Who needs you?  Steve, we got to go.  We're late.  We got to take a break.  Talking about religion is not as important as playing commercials.  Just listen to us until rapture, please. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We're not doing it for you.  God damn it.  What do you say to that?  Okay, I asked you nicely.  And we said no nicely.  Thank you, Steve.  Jesus Christ.  But I love...  Show yourself with a pistol.  The one thing I love about Steve is I really do want to think that dinosaurs were dragons.  Were dragons.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Godzilla.  Whoa.  There he comes.  Look out.  I believe in something.  I think I turned him.  I believe in something.  I just don't know what yet.  Really?  Yeah, I think I want to...  Good luck to you.  I want to start studying other religions. 
[01:23:30]  Well, you have fun with that.  Fantasy world.  Science priests.  Science priests.  So you believe in your science priest?  Yeah.  That's right.  I'm playing EverQuest.  It's like real life EverQuest.  I pray to the atom bomb myself.  That's good.  Planet of the Apes 2.  Yes, yes.  Beneath the Planet of the Apes.  Sure, sure.  And you asked really nicely.  Yes, and we disregarded your request.  Yeah, sorry.  All right, we are 25 minutes late for a break.  Hopefully a miracle will happen and time will go back.  That's right.  The sun will go around the sky and we'll be on time with the sponsor. 
[01:24:00]  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  Lamehole.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're fired up now.  Let's say hi to John in Virginia.  John, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  How are you today?  Pretty good.  I'm just calling up to talk about the guy who was just on the phone. 
[01:24:30]  I understand.  Look, I'm a Christian too.  Here's the situation.  If you believe in an all-powerful God, why the hell can't you believe that he would use  evolution to create the world?  But why wouldn't he create the world with an apparent age or with black holes or any of  that other shit?  I'm sorry, guys.  I'm sorry.  It doesn't make any sense.  You know, if he's going to believe in a God that can do anything, why wouldn't he believe  that God could do all the things that scientists observe? 
[01:25:00]  Why can't God be the ultimate scientist?  You know why?  Because when they wrote the Bible, no one had any of those ideas.  There hadn't been research on space, black holes, dinosaurs.  So that when scientists came up with these things, and they were theories at first, and  then they were proven, it was against what the Bible said.  So they couldn't change their opinions and beliefs and go, oh, yeah, well, God made the 
[01:25:30]  earth and used evolution as a way to populate it.  They have to stick to their guns and say the earth is 6,000 years old.  No matter how ridiculous of an idea that is, how insanely ridiculous that the earth could  be at the state it's in now, from creation to right now in 6,000 years.  And wouldn't it take dragons more than 6,000 years to go from dragons to birds?  That's a big jump in 6,000 years. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  But what if God had all this knowledge and he didn't want to share this scientific knowledge  with anyone, because then he wouldn't be God.  Yeah, he's got to be.  Because then a lot of people would have the same knowledge.  Right.  Guys, I completely agree with you on the fact that the problem is people did not understand  when the Bible was written.  Human beings were writing these books.  Whether or not they were inspired by God to write these books, they were still using  whatever knowledge they had.  So they didn't understand what they really, what they were observing. 
[01:26:30]  Okay?  So what I'm saying is, maybe the problem is the Catholic Church has been interpreting the  Bible one way and needs to rethink.  You know, look at the Bible.  The Bible even says that God has no concept of time.  One day to God is like, they use a metaphor, one day to God is like a thousand years.  So even the creation story you can't take literally, because if one day to God, you know,  is, it could be essentially infinite, then each step of evolution could be one day in  the creation story.  Yes. 
[01:27:00]  And the reason that Anthony was right, they didn't have certain knowledge, and the reason  that science makes a lot more sense, because they update.  Like, when theories are seen to be, like, incomplete or incorrect, science proves, disproves,  proves, they test, test, test.  Religion has stuck by the same story and does nothing but try to find ways to justify why  their story is correct, whereas science will always prove and retest theories, and different  people who are not connected will always go out and retest theories. 
[01:27:30]  Religion is simply based on stories that are told over and over and over and miracles in  the past that cannot be seen.  Yeah, how do you take, you have to take an example like the earth was the center of the  universe, everything revolved around the earth, until science figured out that, no, that  wasn't the way it was.  And they proved that.  It's proven.  We know that the sun is in the middle of our solar system, and we as a planet revolve around 
[01:28:00]  that sun with other planets.  It's been proven.  But how did we prove it?  Like...  We proved it through telescopes, and then spacecraft, and there's plenty of ways that science has  proven that.  Yeah, but the religion can't rewrite history.  They're not going to say, oh yeah, the ark was there for three days, and so, you know  what I mean?  They can't rewrite it, because then people are, you know, that's the facts from back  then, supposedly to them. 
[01:28:30]  You see what I'm saying?  Well, the thing that is just, it's so irritating, is the way that guy was arguing is because he's  had this argument so many times, and he knows he can't win it.  He can't prove it.  So what he does is he begins to doubt anything that resembles proof.  Like, well, how do you know?  Did a scientist...  That's almost like saying, because I don't understand the concept of electricity, I shouldn't  have faith that the light is actually coming through.  Maybe God's beaming it right through.  Like, that was this...  Exactly.  Let's argue the whole concept of what proof is.  People hop in their cars on a daily basis and have no concept, whatever, whatsoever, how 
[01:29:00]  it works, yet they know, they turn the key, they step on the gas pedal, and it goes, and  that was brought to them through research, engineering, science.  But to that guy, it's all in the same category as religion, which is hysterical.  Can it be a little of both?  I mean, can it be evolution, and there's some historical fact that some of the stuff did  happen back then?  The only, even remotely religious thing I'll accept as, not even fact, but the only thing 
[01:29:30]  I'll accept is that something had to start the whole ball rolling.  I don't know what that was, but that kind of...  I think that's beyond human comprehension, to tell you the truth.  So you just...  What?  The Jews?  You're hysterical.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss, the Jew.  It's a Jew. 
[01:30:00]  Make my bed, Jew.  We were getting way too intelligent on this show today, so I want to thank Voss for stopping  by.  Voss was right, though, maybe.  To dumb it down a little bit for everybody.  He made a great point that I made two minutes earlier.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't hear...  What are you talking about?  You made a...  All right, listen, let me say hi to Pete in Florida.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to tell you, I just went through RCIA, which is Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults.  I'm 28.  First thing that guy has to know, or you guys could help, too. 
[01:30:30]  Most people that are Catholic in a lot of religions are baptized at birth, and they don't actually  learn about what they're talking about, so they have really no foundation in what they're  saying.  And when I was talking to my director about some of these things, and this topic was  one of them, was the creation.  If you guys remember the movie Inherit the Wind, and the first day could have been a million  years long, whatever.  They weren't...  I was never taught that, you know, stuff about dragons or something else wacky like that.  It was, hey, we're not saying it might not have taken a long time. 
[01:31:00]  We're not saying there's no such thing as dinosaurs.  But we are saying that God did it, and that's all.  So I never heard once some stupid argument like that guy had.  Well, the guy really blew it by bringing up dragons.  It's just...  He really blew it on that point.  I like the dragon thing.  I want to think that there were dragons.  I was cracking up, too, because I might have been one of the only people who heard you  in the background going, like, I like dragons.  I do like dragons.  I want to think that's possible. 
[01:31:30]  So, I mean, I don't know.  That's the problem, I think, is that all these people have these beliefs that...  But, you know, and even tell you, if you're going through RCIA, that you probably know  more now than 99% of Catholics, because 99% of Catholics didn't become Catholic in their  late 20s or 30s.  They were born that way, and they never were taught anything.  They were just, hey, you're Catholic.  Their greatest fear, religion's greatest fear or greatest discomfort, is that science  is going to disprove what they have no way to come back with. 
[01:32:00]  Like, you know, when Kaku was talking about possibly the way the universe was born through  other universes, religion and a lot of that, that really does kind of upend religion.  All these things that science has shown has just put doubt on what the Bible says and  what religion says, because we had no modern science then.  And they fight that.  They fought evolution being taught in schools.  They completely fight any kind of, like, progressive thought in that area. 
[01:32:30]  And they say they don't, but they do.  Did you ever believe in God, Jimmy?  I still do.  You do believe in God?  Of course.  Just in a different way?  It's a different concept.  I find that.  That's kind of where I'm at.  I don't know if we, I don't know, we haven't really been told everything.  We never will be told everything.  There's a power greater than you, because people, as parents, God is a fearing object  that they put into you as a kid.  Or fearful.  Yeah, fearful.  And what's the difference?  You said fearing.  That means God's a scaredy cat.  Well, sometimes he is. 
[01:33:00]  I never once used it to say that science is worthless now, because how can you say that?  When you use it and you live with it every day, and then say, oh, that's your religion, not mine.  Because he's had this discussion too many times, and he knows that science will trump him every time,  because there's constant testing and retesting, and he has to go back to some broad in the 1700s,  and 70,000 people saw the sun bounce, did they?  Yeah, do you know any of those 70,000 people? 
[01:33:30]  Of course he did.  It was probably a sun flare.  Could be anything back then.  That's what it is.  They thought the lights, what are the lights of Aurora, what have you said?  Yeah, yeah, the northern lights, Aurora Borealis.  People thought that those were.  They probably burned them all as witches, too.  Yeah, then they killed the 70,000 people.  What did you see?  The sun bounced around the sky.  We must kill you all.  We will kill everybody.  Okay.  Yeah.  Scientists also had their own agenda, too.  Yeah, you know, some of them, sure. 
[01:34:00]  They wanted to try harder to prove something than really get the facts,  but, I mean, as far as science and religion go,  I think science comes a little closer to what's reality.  Because they try to retest it, and there's always people proving and disproving,  and usually they come to some kind of a general consensus, like on gravity.  All scientists pretty much agree on the principles of gravity,  because enough of them have tried to disprove it.  And you don't have to say, well, we've got to stick to everything we knew in the year 1430. 
[01:34:30]  Right.  Anything after that we can't prove or disprove or anything like that.  No, constantly.  2008, they're still working on stuff proving and disproving things.  But there is facts of people that their lives have been saved from prayer or different things from prayer.  No, there is, in fact.  No, there isn't.  What if they didn't pray?  You don't know.  They might have been fine, too.  They don't know why they were officially saved.  But there's religions that won't use doctors, that won't use, I don't know. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, and you usually read about the kids dying.  And there's ones living, too.  I mean, it's something that you can't prove.  And science, we were listening to a Jew with tattoos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just wanted to make that tattooed Jew.  The tattooed Jew.  Hey, can I throw it?  Going against his own religion, but he's going to tell everyone else about religion.  That's, first of all, that whole tattoo.  You shouldn't have tattoos if you're a Jew.  That's not true, because.  A Jew.  That's propaganda.  A Jew.  A Jew. 
[01:35:30]  Why would you tattoo a Jew?  Why did you put it on your claws?  Listen, you're pissing off the guy that killed your lord, so stop it.  Exactly.  Hey, Anthony, do you believe in God?  Or did you ever believe in God?  I don't.  Where are you at?  I don't know.  Like I said before, there's probably some friggin' weird Star Trek-looking fuzzy cloud  thing out there that just knows everything.  But as far as this God with a white beard and his son Jesus and this friggin' guy in the  robe that's going to F up traffic in Manhattan and all that organized religion crap and 80,000 
[01:36:00]  churches and brick and steeples and all that happy horse crap, stained glass windows with  fake people from storybooks in it.  Is that a yes?  That's crap.  I would.  Yes, it's a yes.  I believe in all of it.  I would believe in Jesus a little bit more if they would update his look and say, all  right, obviously he was a Middle Eastern.  Yeah, exactly.  He was from that area of the world.  He's not a white guy that plays in the Black Crows. 
[01:36:30]  Maybe took after his father, God.  Scientists don't keep you guys out.  Who, of course, is white.  Just darken his skin a little bit and give him some more Mediterranean, like Middle Eastern  features.  And then I might believe a little more.  That's where he was from.  He was not a white guy.  Look, I don't believe in him, but if I did, he was white.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Don't want to mix your racism and your religion, right, Andy?  And my things I don't believe in, too.  We got to take another break to catch up.  We really do. 
[01:37:00]  Did you have a final point, Jimmy?  Yes.  If you really love God, this Thursday through Sunday, you'll be free with it.  Oh, Jimmy, no, you didn't.  Because the Lord wants me to succeed in Caroline.  He has spoken to me.  You did not just do that, Jimmy.  By opening acts with dragons.  Ooh, I'll be there.  They'll be breathing far.  And we will see James Norton at Caroline's.  I'm looking at a picture of Jesus right now.  I got to tell you, he looks a lot like Billy Mitchell from King of Kong.  He doesn't play Donkey Kong as well, though.  According to Billy.  I have some great new Jesus material myself. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Voss is going to be at the Cinema Draft House in Arlington, Virginia.  But I do.  April 18th and 19th.  That would be this weekend.  I'd like to read a letter now from Jim Norton to the Corinthians.  Show up at Caroline's.  Yes, or I won't make bonus.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  So says the Lord.  So says the Lord.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  We're going to change gears a little bit, a little bit, because we've got Jack Cafferty 
[01:38:00]  in trouble, saying some awful things about the Chinese, or China in general.  And we've got more King of Kong audio, and we've got Rich Voss showing off his tumor or  his cyst to everybody today.  We've got a kidney cyst or something.  We'll get into that.  And I want to go to break with something that Derek put together.  Tippi Tom was in here, our homeless friend.  His videos are up on YouTube.  They're terrific.  Proves there's no God right there.  I recommend the Sophie's Choice viewing.  Tippi Tom.  Favorite clip.  Homeless guy crying as he watches. 
[01:38:30]  Sophie's Choice.  That video's now up on YouTube.  No!  And also, he's definitely bisexual.  He may be homosexual.  Yeah, who knows.  And last time he was in, we lined up the guys and allowed Tippi to take a look at some  butts to see which one he liked the best on staff.  Derek took that audio and made this.  You want to hear a song?  Yeah, let's hear a song.  A little tune.  All right.  Give me time.  It's about a song.  Hey!  Pull your bass down.  Come on. 
[01:39:00]  Hey!  Pull your bass down.  Hey!  Pull your bass down.  Let me see your ass.  Hey!  Pull your bass down.  Hey!  Pull your bass down.  Hey!  Pull your bass down.  I want to shoot like the nicest ass.  Check out the honey.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  That's a booty.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Eh, eh, ass.  Damn, that booty.  Booty.  Damn, that booty.  Booty.  Damn, that booty.  Booty.  That's a real ass.  Check out the honey.  Oh, God, oh, that's real ass. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, God, I want some of that.  Oh, God, oh, that's real ass.  Oh, God, oh, that's the best ass I've ever seen.  My God, hold me back.  I'm an ass man.  Tell me am I very far. 
[01:40:00]  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Talking about religion today because I guess because the Pope is in town.  And when I mean town, I mean the United States of America.  Where is he today?  In New York.  He's not in New York today.  You would know if he was in.  No, no, he's in Washington.  He's in D.C. for a little, you know, adulation down there. 
[01:40:30]  And then he gets his adulation up here in New York and striving Jimmy nuts.  Jimmy saw the Pope on TV.  He's like, look at him just standing there getting his adulation.  The ghoul, the ghoulish Pope.  I don't mind him being respected and treated with respect.  But what I hate is the Holy Father crap.  That's the way you're supposed to address God.  You're not supposed to address a guy like that.  The Pope is God's right-hand man here on earth. 
[01:41:00]  He's been good.  Treated with a tremendous amount of respect.  But don't address him the way you address God.  That drives me nuts.  He's a head CEO in his religious circles.  Yeah, that's what he is.  He works his way up to Pope.  Leave it to the Jewish guy to make it a business thing.  Well, I'm saying he didn't start off as Pope.  He works his way up to Pope.  Shut up.  We're laughing.  Yeah, we're having a good laugh at you.  This show is still trying to get laughs out.  Shut up.  We're laughing.  Yeah, it's really.  That's a really good line, man.  You're just babbling with your theory still.  Shut up. 
[01:41:30]  It has a great line.  You're like, no, it's not because I'm Jewish.  That's right.  It's just happening to you.  You become logical.  Right.  Listen, sometimes confident voice is logical.  Oh.  You guys want to move on to other things or what?  I mean, we could do the God thing.  I want to applaud you guys on your arguing skills, by the way.  That's much more accurate than me.  I can't be bothered with a lot of arguments.  I can't be bothered when it comes to arguing about religion.  I can't be bothered when it comes to arguing about abortion, which is the right way, because 
[01:42:00]  you never win.  It's just ridiculous.  No one ever wins these arguments.  I do.  You do?  Always.  In your head or just like?  Because I'm right.  And politics.  Democrat versus Republican crap.  Well, there is a God.  Scientists do not make Lisa Lampinelli famous.  That's good.  It was good for the hundred people that know who Lisa Lampinelli is. 
[01:42:30]  It doesn't matter.  You get this today.  Oh, no.  Yes.  You've been rickrolled.  Yes.  You've just been rickrolled.  Yes.  That's right.  You've been rickrolled.  You've been rickrolled.  I believe, um, I believe, uh, Sam, while I was trying to rickroll people yesterday.  Really?  What happened, Anthony?  He sent out an email saying that, um, Lily's, uh, video was edited from yesterday when, um,  when Dave, uh, took, uh, a movement in, in her hat. 
[01:43:00]  Her brand new hat that she got while.  From Japan.  While visiting Japan.  Yeah.  It's not like a hat you could get, I don't know, on 57th Street here in New York.  Jimmy said it looked just like Peter Cushing's hat in Star Wars, which is hysterical.  It looked exactly like it.  Yeah.  She really, she really should have been, uh, condemning someone to death with firing on,  what was it, Altoon?  Alderaan.  Yeah, whatever.  We just, I didn't know that.  Lily's never been on this side of the radio show.  We just, we just suck.  We're women haters because she's beautiful. 
[01:43:30]  And what do we do?  She gets back from Japan with this really nice hat that she thinks is, uh, looking good  on her.  Mm-hmm.  And we have a guy do his thing in the hat.  Make, uh, yeah.  So what happened?  Uh, Sam, uh, got the video and he, uh, how did he rickroll everything?  Well, he put the link up, uh, on it, in an email and sent it to everybody.  He said, here's the link.  Click here and you'll see the video.  So, and, uh, you click and it took you right to the, um, yes.  Oh, Sam, you did it.  The video of Rick Astley.  Sam, you didn't do that. 
[01:44:00]  And then he sent me.  What was it?  A very, uh, provocative email.  And what was that?  Sam, uh, saying that perhaps, um, he could replace Keith in my house.  What?  And there were, uh, offers of sexual favors involved.  I think Sam needs, uh, to explain himself a little bit.  You're getting an attitude, young man.  No, I have no attitude.  The problem is I might have accidentally left my email open when I left the office.  Oh, oh, yeah.  And you think that the staff here would be rude enough to use your email and send out erroneous 
[01:44:30]  emails?  Uh, the Anthony Houseboy email was expected as, uh, when a staff member leaves their email  open, it's a time-honored tradition to send a homosexual email to Amp from their account.  Uh, one time he also sent me an email saying that he wanted to, uh, gay, uh, wrestle with  Gay wrestle?  How do you gay wrestle, Sam?  I don't know.  Why don't you explain how you gay wrestle with someone?  I don't know how gay wrestle with someone. 
[01:45:00]  You sent the email.  You freak.  Anytime you wrestle.  You sent the email, my friend.  Very good.  The email was sent from my account.  Well.  But it was sent by someone.  And you enjoy a little gay wrestling, huh?  Never.  Never?  No gay wrestling.  As a goof?  Not even as a goof.  You don't gay wrestle as a goof?  No.  You sure?  Doesn't he look like a doctor?  It's not gay if you're goofing.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, no, I didn't.  Ah, you've been rickrolled, my friends.  Oh, boy, what happened?  Rickrolled. 
[01:45:30]  Somebody is saying that we're way behind the rickroll thing.  But that's why we're doing it.  Yeah.  Understand the stupidity of this radio show.  And the over-the-top sarcasm as we play.  Never gonna give you up.  Never gonna let you up.  Don't even worry about it, people.  See, if I have to take you inside the show, we were very aware of the rickroll thing.  But we didn't think it was important enough to actually bring to the radio show.  Until, of course, it got overplayed.  So now we're doing it with a lot of sarcasm involved. 
[01:46:00]  And the Mets, when they had the web vote on the song that they would be playing at the stadium.  Yeah.  And they were rickrolled.  They were?  That's kind of when it, yeah.  Oh, they sure were, Jim.  Yeah, they had song choices up.  Or you could write in a song.  And they were rickrolled.  And Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up is the song they had to play at Shea.  Are you kidding me?  No.  All right.  That's the song those idiots have to play is Rick Astley.  Yeah, they got rickrolled.  And they're trying to get out of it somehow.  Yeah, they're trying to.  Thank you, Sam. 
[01:46:30]  Thank you for your thoughts on gay wrestling.  And thank you.  But I don't think Anthony wants to have gay sex with you anytime soon.  Just stop emailing me those emails.  They're uncomfortable.  I don't think it's professional for you to be emailing me with such things.  And I might have to go to Human Resources.  Tsk, tsk, young man.  I don't think my point got across.  Anyway.  Hey, the governor of New York, we were saying earlier, he's blind.  Legally blind.  That's right.  He's a what and a what?  Yeah.  He threw out the first pitch at Shea Stadium. 
[01:47:00]  And, oh, my God.  We have audio.  Oh.  We do.  Right.  We're the only radio station with audio.  No, he is blind.  Of the blind governor throwing out the first pitch.  Yeah.  I wonder how that went.  At Shea Stadium.  I'll bet it went without incident.  Yeah, it probably does.  That's why we're playing it.  Here comes the blind joke.  Presenting community outreach with the governor of New York, David Patterson.  In today's edition, the new governor throws out the ceremonial first pitch at Shea Stadium. 
[01:47:30]  Hot dogs.  Get your hot dogs here.  Hot dogs.  Oh, no.  I think he's a hot dog guy.  Somebody call an ambulance.  I like to know that these guys would go to a baseball game when they're not working for the show.  Hey, I got tickets to a game. 
[01:48:00]  I want to go.  Oh, so do I.  Let's go to the game.  He only can pick one of us.  Oh, no.  He hates it.  Oh, it's awful.  All right.  And can I say that Al Pacino has jumped the shark?  Why?  Just a while ago.  Yeah.  Know what you mean?  88 minutes.  Jack Grimm has 88 minutes to solve a murder. 
[01:48:30]  His own.  Damn it.  Wait, what?  What's the premise of that?  How does this look stupid?  How do you solve your own murder?  I don't know, but Jack Grimm will.  Jack Grimm.  Do we have a name or Jack Grimm?  Pacino stinks.  Can we get the trailer for this movie?  And how do you solve your own murder?  Does he come back as a ghost or something?  Solve my own murder.  That's stupid.  I'm going to kill me.  You know what's funny?  If he was in the front row at Catalyze this weekend, you would do everything in your power to get a picture with him. 
[01:49:00]  I would do it during the show.  Well, you have to.  I would do it during the show.  Yeah, of course.  He would blow off his own show just to get a picture.  Yeah.  He caught me.  Of course I would.  Got to solve my murder.  Yeah.  Ugh.  You caught me.  What happened?  What is he playing?  That board game with the thing in the kitchen.  The clue.  Yeah, clue.  I'm playing clue.  It's Colonel Mustard.  Right.  In the parlor with a candlestick. 
[01:49:30]  All right, we'll have the trailer.  I didn't even know that he had a movie.  Yeah.  The trailer.  Hoo-ah.  Hoo-ah.  Hoo-ah.  Hoo-ah.  What happened to the soft-spoken one?  I think he's a bad cop.  We got people on the papers, don't we?  To this.  What happened?  I don't know.  He yells a lot.  He's doing theater acting.  It's like, we have cameras, Al.  Don't worry about it.  There's a mic in front of you.  And Voss really caught me.  That ass Pacino for a picture.  Oh, you got me good. 
[01:50:00]  I did Fox Red Eye last night with Dr. Michael Bodden, and I got a picture with him.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The creepy pathologist.  He is a creep.  You did it with that ghoul?  From what show?  Fox Red Eye.  No, no.  What show is that guy in?  Well, he's a very famous...  Oh, I know.  Oh, you're talking about, okay, from autopsy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, sure, sure.  He rules.  Wait, wait.  He's done famous autopsies, or he's on...  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah.  He's touched every famous dead body.  Kennedy?  If they re-dug him up. 
[01:50:30]  I mean...  Yeah?  That was 63.  I might want to say he might have been involved in something with Kennedy.  He also did the OJ.  He testified for the defense, actually.  But, yeah, my...  88 Minutes is being released over a year after it was released on DVD in Brazil.  Oh, that does...  Oh.  This has got to be a good one.  Oh.  He has 88 minutes to solve a murder.  Oh.  His own.  He's only got 88 minutes, Sam.  To solve what?  His own.  His own.  Don't we have to break it? 
[01:51:00]  No.  Okay.  Mmm.  I don't want to do it.  Gypsy!  I don't want to do it.  Gypsy, you haven't been on our show in a while.  How do you solve your own murder?  Yeah, how do you do that, Gypsy?  Maybe Sam will help out.  Yeah.  Sam will find all the evidence and then fix my little corn-on-the-cob teeth.  I have throat cancer.  You've got to solve your own murder. 
[01:51:30]  Get my members-only jacket, Sam.  I'm going to talk to the punk rockers.  Punk rockers.  All right.  Well, now we've got to play the punk rockers.  And then he's going to go to his boat.  Hold on.  This is-  And relax.  This is actually Quincy talking to the punk rockers that Jimmy just referred to.  I mean, Jimsy just referred to.  Jimsy.  You think we're all zombie killers?  You're the killers.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  Very genuine dialogue.  We're just your lousy escape goat. 
[01:52:00]  Escape goat.  Yeah.  Where's Quincy's speech?  Where's Quincy?  We like the zombie punk rock dudes better.  If I could talk to them.  Hey, if I could just get on stage and talk to them.  The music stops immediately.  I love-  You think we're all zombie killers?  It's like a parody of the worst dialogue you've ever seen.  I've never heard worst dialogue.  That's horrid.  I want to touch my girlfriend's ass.  It's flat, Sam.  Kind of like your face.  Very nice. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, we got another broadcaster.  Another broadcaster in trouble.  Yeah, what happened?  Jack Cafferty.  I don't know if I like him or hate him.  I don't know.  He used to be a local guy here in New York.  He's a big deal on CNN.  Doing his Cafferty file.  He seems like a grouch.  Yeah.  Like a grumpy old bastard. 
[01:53:00]  But unfortunately, Jack Cafferty, I say unfortunately because we just got to stop this crap.  He said something and he had to apologize.  We got to stop apologizing because you're giving every special interest group out there power.  And they don't need power.  Oh, please.  Jack Cafferty said this.  As we continue to import their junk with the lead paint on-  Okay, thank you.  Setup is, he's talking about China.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  So far, so good from what I just heard, though. 
[01:53:30]  The Chinese are common.  They're junk.  Remember that.  As we continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poison pet food  and export, you know, jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollar a month to turn out the stuff that we're buying from Walmart.  So I think our relationship with China has certainly changed.  I think they're basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last 50 years.  All right, Jack.  Stand by.  I want everybody to stand by.  Hey, we have a lot more to talk about.  Oh, Wolf Blitzer.  I already knew there was a problem with that. 
[01:54:00]  You could hear it in his voice.  I don't disagree with what he said.  There's no problem with what, Jack.  That's his opinion.  And he's talking about the Chinese government, not talking about individual Chinese people that are working or being oppressed over there.  He's talking.  They are a bunch of thugs.  The Chinese government is a bunch of thugs.  In what way?  Explain.  They have one of the worst human rights records in the world, especially for a country that is supposedly part of the civilized society. 
[01:54:30]  You know, they're not considered one of these throwaway countries that we don't do business with.  We do huge amounts of business.  China's holding a hell of a lot of our money and just horrid human rights record.  Well documented.  Yeah.  They're known for oppressing their people.  There's no freedoms of information.  They cut people off from the Internet, which I truly believe brought down communism in Russia. 
[01:55:00]  I think information, getting out and getting in there once we got satellite television, things like that.  You know, that's not even â€“ I completely agree with that.  And when we went into Iraq and Afghanistan and all that, I made the suggestion that we just start handing out â€“ well, I'll update it now â€“ iPhones to everybody.  And we'll turn those people like that.  Yeah, take a look at what's out there.  We'll turn those people in a second. 
[01:55:30]  Technology will do that.  That's what happened.  You know, people started getting a glimpse of â€“ they heard their government talk about what the West was all about for so long,  and then they got a firsthand look at it through the technology that's out there, the media.  Completely agree with that.  And went, hey, wait a minute.  I think these guys are lying to me.  Yeah, there's another way to look at the world here.  But China's been doing a great job of keeping their people in the dark and oppressing them.  But we still deal with them.  We still deal with them.  And like Jack Hafferty said, we buy their crap that is tainted. 
[01:56:00]  Everything's got lead on it over there.  What the hell is going on in China?  Everything's full of lead.  And then they send it over here.  Dirt cheap.  We use their labor.  Dirt cheap.  And we get what we pay for.  Poison.  And the government is still the same bunch of thugs that was running the place years ago.  What did he say that was so bad?  Who's coming after him?  It's so obvious what he meant, too. 
[01:56:30]  Of course.  But it's a bunch of sniveling little just sissies, which is what our society is,  who say he's talking about Chinese people.  But he wasn't.  Them hosting the Olympics is a joke, too.  And why does he have to apologize when his whole job for CNN is to kind of editorialize?  Yeah, he's not a newscaster.  He's not a newscaster.  Right.  Yeah, he's not there as an anchor.  You want to hear his apology?  Probably not.  This is so depressing when people have to apologize, read statements with a gun to their head. 
[01:57:00]  Sorry.  Just kind of remembering back about a year ago.  Here we go.  Before we get to the question, a clarification.  Last week during a discussion of the controversy surrounding China's hosting of the Olympic Games,  I said that the Chinese are basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they have been for the last 50 years.  I was referring to the Chinese government and not to Chinese people or to Chinese Americans. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, man.  He's pissed that he has to do that.  I think there was a nice argument in the offices at CNN.  He did not want to do that.  A clarification like that is fine.  That's not a groveling.  But it was pretty obvious.  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.  But he just said, this is what I meant.  Fine.  He's not saying, I apologize.  This is what I meant.  Everybody knew what he meant.  I got to tell you one thing, a little observation.  I'm good with the observation.  Jack Cafferty, sounding a bit old since he had that hit song. 
[01:58:00]  No, that's not Jack Cafferty.  What?  That's John Cafferty.  Oh, his brother.  Oh.  And the Beaver Brown Band.  Oh.  Is it John Cafferty?  I opened for those.  Oh.  You opened for them?  Oh, it's John Cafferty.  I thought, oh, his brother sang that song.  I didn't know.  You were talking about special interest groups.  I was watching that show with Eddie Izzert, and they're basically gypsies, and they call  themselves travelers, because they won't say gypsy on TV. 
[01:58:30]  And I didn't even know gypsies have a special interest group now.  Travelers?  Yeah.  Okay, Gypsy Woman.  What show?  The one Eddie Izzert's on FX.  He's got...  It's a pretty good show.  The Riches.  The Riches.  Get a mic, Eric.  I can't hear you.  Give me your tears, Gypsy Woman.  The Riches is a very good TV program.  I'll help Rich Voss out a little bit.  Yeah?  But I'm just saying, Spencer, you're not allowed to say gypsy.  They call themselves travelers.  Travelers, right.  Travelers.  Hey, this is actually right. 
[01:59:00]  There is a very high who cares factor with your comment, but you are true.  I die with it on my lips.  I never take it off.  The who cares factor was quite high.  It really was on red.  But who cares factor.  But the knowledge was definitely there, Rich.  We're talking about special interest groups.  You know, I'm just trying to add to it.  The gypsies? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's call a gypsy anything.  We got the Al Pacino trailer for this.  88 minutes.  He's only got 88 minutes to solve a murder, but I don't want to give away whose murder  he has to solve.  Oh, God.  Go to the table.  All right.  I'll do that, Jimmy.  Yeah.  You have 88 minutes to live.  Who the hell is this?  I received a threatening phone call.  You better turn on MSNBC.  I find it hard to believe that Dr. Jack Graham can be psychobabbling innocent people into the  death chamber.  What's going on?  Dale Morris was murdered.  They found evidence that implicates you. 
[02:00:00]  Who's a murderer now, Jack?  Can't you see this as a frame?  Did I fire bullets at myself?  Did I blow up my car?  It's genius, isn't it?  I'm going to find you.  88 minutes.  Rated R in theaters this spring.  Well, we know the movie won't be an hour and a half.  That's horrible.  I guess hour and 41 minutes doesn't sound as good.  I apologize in advance to the interns.  Boom.  Sorry about that. 
[02:00:30]  That was close.  But why?  He's got to solve a murder.  Would I fire bullets at myself?  You should have when you saw that script.  Al, what are you doing?  Making horrid movies.  What is De Niro doing?  You know what?  God bless, oh God, Coppola, who blasted both of them.  He said, I don't know what they're doing, but it's not acting.  Wow, did he?  Oh, yeah.  Did he really say that to me?  Yes, he did.  And I think he said Nicholson, too.  I don't know what they're doing.  Yeah, Nicholson, too.  But especially those two, it's like all they're doing is just cheesy cop movie. 
[02:01:00]  What are you guys doing?  Real bad, predictable, dreck.  Stop trying to be action heroes, man.  You guys are brilliant.  An action hero.  You're not.  Yeah.  You're not Al either, I'm sorry.  I've talked to you like you were.  Yeah.  I disagreed with you, but as Al.  A lot of people are just very confused that Jack Cafferty would get in trouble for that  comment.  It was obvious.  It was so obvious.  It was obvious that it didn't need clarification.  All right.  Hey, we might need to get Sam back in here. 
[02:01:30]  Anthony in New York.  Not.  Oh, yes.  Hey, Anthony.  Listen, Anthony, I know you were looking for a religion to look into.  How about you look into McMahonism?  What the hell was that?  Eric.  Vince McMahon.  It's his religion.  He's the god.  Does he want me to break into some kind of...  No, I know.  That was pretty subtle.  Sam, but Sam, did Vince McMahon used to have his own religion?  Yeah.  He did.  Take your time.  What was it based on?  I don't know. 
[02:02:00]  Sauntered.  Jesus.  Saunter away.  A lot of wind resistance in that hair.  He was running.  I love the saunter as we have just tremendous pressure as we're live across America.  We need something quick, and we watch the saunter.  The saunter.  He's like to keep on trucking things.  Swinging his thing in front of him.  Taking a casual stroll.  What do you got, Sam?  McMahonism is the religion in which the god you worship is Vince McMahon.  Please get me audio.  And did he...  What did he do as a god?  He shouted... 
[02:02:30]  He never had any specific actions, but he went into a church.  Oh, there he is on...  I'm looking at him.  With his granny glasses on.  How long ago was this?  Reading from the Bible events or something.  Not terribly long ago.  No?  Yeah.  He's there with Shane O'Mac.  Yeah.  Probably like a year and a half ago, two years ago.  All right.  Well, you have to get audio of that.  What do you got in your hand there?  More Billy Mitchell stuff.  Oh.  Oh, now I like you again.  Billy Mitchell.  Just stay away from that gay wrestling, Sam.  That's not going to be good for your image.  I don't do any gay wrestling.  Anyway, we got Rich Voss in the studio today. 
[02:03:00]  He's playing the Cinema Draft House in Arlington, Virginia.  What?  Friday, Saturday.  Friday, Saturday.  ArlingtonDraftHouse.com.  Tickets available right now.  And Rich, just hilarious on a comedy stage.  Rich is hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  No, Jimmy.  No.  After the break.  After the break.  Jimmy has a huge announcement.  He's leaving the show.  He'll give you details next.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:03:30]  Jimmy has left the show.  Where the hell did he go?  With no explanation.  I told you he was leaving the show.  I thought he at least would explain to everybody.  Oh, that was quick.  He's back already.  Came crawling back.  He never failed.  Yes.  I was going to shoot a movie, and then I walked out and realized, oh, I have an audition  for what I booked on.  I better come back and apologize.  The thing about you, scum die.  I didn't mean it.  Good improv, Jim.  You scum die.  Great. 
[02:04:00]  Exactly.  And you're going to be on Good Morning America tomorrow?  Yeah, but it's the third hour, because I'm doing Caroline's Thursday through Sunday.  And Caroline, who's her club, has a segment.  But I think it's in the third hour.  However, I know I leave here at 9.45, or I get there at 9.45, and I'm back late at  10.30, so whatever.  Is it going to be on TV?  I don't know.  What's that?  It's with Kathie Lee, the third hour.  I honestly don't know.  I know it's from Caroline.  No, that's not true.  Yes, it is.  Is it?  The third hour.  Are you going to be on Good Morning America or the Today Show? 
[02:04:30]  Oh.  Good Morning America.  One of them has Kathie Lee.  Yeah, exactly.  One of them.  That's what I was getting at.  Yeah, because Diane sort of wanted me.  That would be the Today Show.  Diane sort of wanted me, but I'm like, I was too busy.  I'm like, I can't die.  I'm like, Diane, I can't, you know.  Yeah.  So that's kind of cool, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Not what you just said, but I mean, the fact that you're going to be on TV tomorrow.  What I just said was words that were devoid of interest or humor.  I actually could have just said stool, table, chair.  Right.  And it would have had the same humor value.  Yeah, I'm doing that.  I don't even think I get to talk to her, the black lady who had... 
[02:05:00]  I talked to her at my smoothie place recently.  I don't forget her name.  I forgot her name.  I don't get one.  Robin.  Robin.  No.  Robin.  The black broad from Good Morning America.  Exactly.  Are you allowed to say that?  Black broad from Good Morning America?  What's her name?  Robin?  I don't know.  She just did.  She has cancer or she had cancer.  She just did the...  Yeah.  She walked down the runway without a wig.  She was totally bald.  I guess like just showing that she's doing okay.  Obviously, you saw her, didn't give her a good luck bro at the smoothie place. 
[02:05:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  The worst part of watching her on the runway, it wasn't the wig being off.  It was the awful non-model walk she had.  It was like watching LT walk out for a game.  It was so funny the way she thugged her way down.  That would be Robin Roberts.  Thank you, E-Rock.  I don't get her a dancer, I think.  Give yourself a gold star today.  I'm talking to Caroline.  That's cool, man.  I know, but I don't want to talk to the boss on TV.  She's the...  Oh, she has the segment?  I think she does, yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  I think she might do it herself. 
[02:06:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Yuck.  I don't know.  She's been around long enough.  I'm sure she makes a good go.  It'll be good TV, I'm sure, Jimmy.  Yeah, I know.  That's pretty cool, man.  Hey, we got more King of Kong audio of Billy Mitchell.  We can't get enough of this guy, but it's going to have to wait because we're running  out of show here.  So we'll start teasing for the next show, right?  Damn.  Willem Dafoe tomorrow.  Yes, he's in at 8 o'clock.  And Morgan Spurlock is over at XM at like 9 or whatever.  So we have Willem here at 8 and Morgan... 
[02:06:30]  Willem Dafoe.  We go way back with Morgan.  And his latest movie is about him going and trying to find Obama, right?  No, Bin Laden.  Finding Obama is not hard.  Yeah, it's easy.  Well, now you've got to apologize now.  What?  What?  Now you're going to have to apologize.  Every time that happens, the person has to apologize.  Well, that's an easy mistake, Obama-Osama.  No, people don't see it as that.  They see it as a calculated move to try to link him with a known killer terrorist.  But I...  So now apologize.  No, but I like... 
[02:07:00]  Apologize to Bin Laden.  No, I like Obama.  I'll do this today.  Obama, who do I like?  Osama or Obama?  I think you like Obama.  Obama?  Yeah.  All right, well, um...  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  All right, let's do this then.  This is my apology.  Mm-hmm.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock.  But rock around the clock tonight!  This is horrid.  Have some fun when the clocks rush, when we're gonna rock, around, we're gonna rock tonight! 
[02:07:30]  We're gonna rock, rock, rock till broad daylight!  We're gonna rock, gonna rock, around, we're gonna rock tonight!  Are we?  Yeah, we're trying to.  Oh, really?  Yeah!  Most of us.  You are gonna vote for Obama.  No, I'm not gonna vote.  Oh.  Hey, don't drive me crazy.  No, I don't vote.  If I voted, I would, actually, at this point.  Yeah, I really...  I tell you because I like McCain a lot.  I think he's a sincere guy.  I just think I don't want any more pro-war right now. 
[02:08:00]  I just think, ugh, I'm sick of hearing about it.  I'm sick of the money being wasted.  I don't care if they kill each other.  And I hate Hillary's guts.  So I like him of the three.  And I love the people that say, if you don't vote, you shouldn't have a...  What do they say?  You shouldn't have a voice or something.  It's like, no, I'm making my statement by not voting.  I do not vote.  I will vote.  The next time I vote will be when there is a legitimate third-party candidate.  You'll never vote, then.  Well, that's my thing. 
[02:08:30]  Can I point out the genius of Carlin, once again, is that he did a bit...  And you are all disease, which is one of the greatest stand-up specials ever.  And he's talking about how people say that you didn't vote, you don't have the right to complain.  That's it, yes.  And his brilliant point was that, because I didn't vote, I have the right to complain.  You made this mess.  I didn't.  And it was such...  Wow, that is good.  He is...  He makes me sick to my stomach.  He is so good.  When it comes to observational humor, man... 
[02:09:00]  I mean, a lot of people talk about Seinfeld.  Forget that.  I mean, Seinfeld, obviously, is what he is.  But I mean...  Yeah.  I got the George Carlin box set.  I'm going through it, slowly but surely.  It's just brilliant.  His stuff is just brilliant.  And holds up, too.  Holds up.  I'm watching some of his HBO specials from, what, 20 years ago?  20-some-odd years ago?  And it's relevant to what's going on today.  Yeah, he's just...  He's really brilliant, man.  It's...  Him and Pryor are just the two greatest ever.  Absolutely.  I agree with you, Jimmy.  Rich, how's that assist?  You showed us this picture. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, God.  What were you showing us?  A CAT scan?  An MRI?  What do you got there?  CAT scan of the...  We're going to put it up on onaradio.com.  And Rich had EROC put this up dramatically on all the screens here in the studio, and you  didn't get much of a reaction, did you?  Well, I was just showing it to you.  I was like, what do you want to...  It's as big as an orange, it looks like.  Yeah.  What kind of reaction?  I don't want you to do backlit.  It's a perfect circle.  How do we know if that's really rich?  I mean, because your science priest told us that that's your insides. 
[02:10:00]  Well...  Isn't that amazing?  Anything that could look that detailed into your guts?  That's creepy.  And how do you know that's...  It's not an x-ray.  That's like...  Were you at Shea Stadium yesterday?  That's the pitch.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's not a assist.  You think the blind governor pitched a baseball into Rich's kidney?  Well, it's a perfect circle.  It's the size of a baseball.  It's perfect.  On the side of it, it says McGregor.  You know something, Rich?  The cyst thing on there isn't the most disturbing thing. 
[02:10:30]  It's the intestines?  It's the intestines full of whatever garbage you ate.  And then you can see also your dirty bits, as they call them.  The root.  Your nasty bits.  It's the root.  Oh, really?  That's not the root.  That's the whole thing.  It's as if a cross-section was taken of Rich Voss.  Like, they chopped him in half.  Right.  So you saw his insides.  Oh, isn't that...  Look how...  Those are nice muscles, though, in the legs. 
[02:11:00]  All right, Rich.  I didn't realize that.  Everyone, when you look at a thing like this, has muscles in their legs.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It's a CAT scan.  Because we all have muscles.  The problem is the fat that hides them.  We all have muscles that look like that, for the most part.  Especially in the legs, because you use your legs every day.  Exactly.  Is that an extra, like, extra storage for, like, saliva, and it's not really a cyst?  That's right, stupid.  He's calling you drooly.  Deal with it. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  I didn't know that was you talking without your finger.  Look at that log.  All right.  So I got to let you know.  I've acknowledged it.  So I slobber.  Everybody's acknowledged it.  The two of you should just go on tour together.  I know.  And she knows.  Hire Harry Chapin to drive the car.  I couldn't have picked the worst driver more topically.  Don't make us start talking about our travels again.  We'll bore the hell out of you some more.  All right.  Yes, he did, by the way.  Coppola dissed. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, really?  Pacino, De Niro.  Oh, I thought that's what you were grabbing.  No, I was going to go with this dumb story about a programmer.  Well, but you started that earlier, Jimmy.  I don't have much here, to be honest.  It was a GQ interview, and he was basically saying that they haven't done anything interesting  in a long time.  You know what he means by a long time.  What's Coppola done lately?  What's Coppola done that's so big lately?  I don't know.  He hasn't done a film in 10 years.  He just did something recently.  Well, then, who is she to talk? 
[02:12:30]  The guy who directed The Godfather.  The big deal.  And The Godfather, too.  And those were the guys.  But those guys were in The Godfather.  And Apocalypse now.  That's when they were good.  And The Departed.  Yeah, here's what he said.  Which he just won an Oscar for.  No, that was Scorsese.  Oh.  Yeah, Scorsese.  Oh, my God, sorry.  Here's what he said.  Oh, no.  Oh, I'm heating up really bad.  Why?  Oh, you're getting...  Oh, you're getting...  Oh, good morning, bear man.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Get it, you shot.  Get it.  Get it. 
[02:13:00]  I'm sorry.  Corbett!  God damn rich horse.  What's wrong?  Try again, dumbass.  Bah!  Come on, you're f***ing out of my beer time.  Oh, wow.  That's all right.  No, that's a biggie.  You can't make that mistake ever.  What he was saying for is...  Thanks, Iraq.  He was saying, I think this is...  He did a bunch.  He kind of crap-talked all of them.  He said, I think if there was a role De Niro was hungry for,  he'd go after it.  I don't think Jack would. 
[02:13:30]  Jack has money and influence in girls.  I think he's a little bit like Brando,  except Brando went through some tough times.  And he goes, you know, even in those days after The Godfather,  I didn't feel that actors were ready to say,  let's do something really ambitious.  He's like praising Javier Bardem.  He's saying that he's ready to go out and try different things.  He just didn't think Pacino and De Niro.  I think when he said De Niro keeps playing the same bad parody of a sociopath.  It was great.  Who's Javier Bardem?  No one acknowledged he spoke. 
[02:14:00]  Let me see.  Seriously?  No one acknowledged he spoke.  I would hand you the paper, but you wouldn't know.  You'd say, and how about this guy, Javier Bardem?  No, he was the guy in No Country, Small Men.  With the creepy Prince Valiant haircut.  You would have known who he was without that movie?  No.  No, but that was his breakthrough movie.  Now everyone does know who he is.  Oh, not everyone, but a lot of them.  I didn't.  Apparently not.  Well, that makes it better.  I stand corrected. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, of course.  I know we have to wrap up really fast.  Programmer pops a question on Girlfriend's Video Game.  I wanted to get into this for a bit, but running out of time.  Hiding a ring in a bouquet just wasn't enough when a computer programmer decided to pop the question.  Bernie Peng reprogrammed Tammy Leigh's favorite video game, Bejeweled.  So a ring and a marriage proposal would show up on the screen when she reached a certain score.  Uh-huh. 
[02:15:00]  Leigh reached the needed score and said...  No.  And said yes.  Ah, damn it.  Well, this wouldn't be a story.  The reprogramming was a tricky task and took him a month.  The couple planned to marry over Labor Day weekend.  He's now being sued by the gaming company for reprogramming their crap.  This Grand Theft Auto.  Like when the pimp caves in the hooker's head and steals her car, a ring fell out of her dead mouth.  See, then you would have a good story for the AP. 
[02:15:30]  Not bejeweled.  Right, and the company is going to supply copies of Bejeweled to hand out his favors to the wedding guests,  which is such a nice thing.  It was Donkey Kong.  Big gift.  And then when she hit a certain level, Billy Mitchell showed up on the screen and shot himself with a ring in his mouth.  And said, I am an ass, aren't I?  I'd like to see that.  Mullet-wearing idiot.  Douche.  Rich, it was a pleasure seeing you.  Thank you.  Thank you for having me.  I'm glad you're okay.  Yeah, you're going to be at the Cinema Drafthouse in Arlington, Virginia. 
[02:16:00]  Highly recommend you go see Rich Voss.  Yes.  We confuse a lot of people out there because we beat you up pretty good on this radio show, don't we, Rich?  It's fun.  Yeah.  But I wouldn't take a shot at you while you're doing your comedy thing.  No.  No way.  Voss is an animal.  Colin pegged you best.  He was just saying, you're kind of a savant, like, it's rare that such a dumb guy is so quick and funny.  Colin pegged you absolutely right because he pointed out the fact, Colin's the first one to point out the Voss is a dumb Jew, which is a monumentally rare thing. 
[02:16:30]  He's a very intelligent people.  Sure.  But not him.  And it's rare for a dumb guy to be so brilliantly quick on saying it.  One of a kind.  That was a compliment, Rich.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Who's Colin?  ArlingtonDrafthouse.com for tickets.  And Jimmy's going to be at Caroline's here in New York City starting tomorrow night.  Two of the shows are sold out.  I don't know which ones.  It's Thursday through Sunday, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  And tomorrow we've got Willem Dafoe on the show.  I'm very psyched.  Yeah, we're all psyched.  We've got to go watch his movie tonight.  Yes.  So we're well prepared. 
[02:17:00]  I hope you're having movie night.  I saw a good porn.  Wow.  A couple of men.  I saw a great porn last night.  The Kite Runner.  We're out of here.  Oh, okay.  The last time I saw a pair of jugs, that big two hillbillies were blowing on them.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's M202.  Before you get pissed off at us, man, we have nothing to do with this. 
[02:17:30]  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what?  I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  Off the air.  Let's say racist things to each other.  Hold on, hold on.  And really turn them off. 
[02:18:00]  Excellence in broadcasting.  Our anus.  What?  Again?  Oh, oh.  Our anus.  What?  Stop.  Enough about the anus.  Ah, this is hurtful.  This is hurtful.  No one wants to hear this on their radio show.  Come collapse on our floor.  It's just potty mouth day.  You may feel shame, but all the same, you are in pain.  You guys ready to laugh? 
[02:18:30]  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  But enough of this palaver.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I just don't want to be here.  What?  Oh, hi.  Can't say that.  No way to start the program.  No.  Here we are at XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  Hi.  Mediocrity about to begin.  I disagree.  Mitch Voss in studio.  Oh, now I agree.  Oh, that's nice.  No, honestly, I wasn't even going there.  I swear to God, I wasn't even going there.  I really wasn't.  I was just going with my hack line, and then I was moving on with the show.  I swear to God, Rich.  We were talking about golf and everything on the walkover.  We're pals.  I know that.  People don't know we're pals when we're not killing each other on the air.  It doesn't.  What's wrong, Jimmy? 
[02:19:30]  Oil.  I mean, oil's at $114.53 a barrel now.  That's right.  But keep our relationship with the shitty fucking Saudis.  Just squeeze your hair and then get.  Are you saying Anthony has greasy hair?  Greasy?  Greasy hair?  You're greasy Dago.  You've also said this is like the greasers in the Celtics.  I'm sorry, Rich.  That was very mean-spirited, Rich.  I know.  We don't do that type of humor on this show.  We do feel-good humor.  That's right.  Because when we do it, we give a little wink like, look, we're just kidding. 
[02:20:00]  Do we?  A little wink.  Uh-oh, there's a conversation going on over there.  Oil.  That is a lot of money.  What?  You know, can we just open up Alaska?  Fucking Jimmy's quick.  Start drilling.  Just start drilling in Alaska.  Can we do that already?  No.  Who's using that place?  I'm a nature guy.  I like my nature.  I'll never-  Have you ever been there?  No, I know.  Then who cares?  No one uses Alaska.  Because I like to think that it's there. 
[02:20:30]  Doing its nature thing.  A lot of these people think, oh my god, Alaska.  We really need Alaska.  It doesn't matter.  It does, though.  I like to think it's just there.  No, we can't afford to have it just there.  We need ch-chunk, ch-chunk, ch-chunk, big friggin' boil pumps there.  Windmills.  No, we just need to-  What?  Windmills?  We need to give up on our dependency for oil, Anthony.  It's time to move on to new technology.  It's not wrong.  Unfortunately.  It's the new technology. 
[02:21:00]  That's all.  Unfortunately.  And then nature gets to do its nature thing, and we get to drive cooler stuff.  Nature's the coolest stuff?  My friggin' cars run on gas, and a lot of it.  Here's the deal.  But here's the deal.  He's just a dick.  My dick.  You're absolutely right.  He's just a dick.  I use a lot of gas.  Get the price down.  You bring up a really good point.  You would be perfect if this was-  You would be like- 
[02:21:30]  You need to be like I Am Legend.  You would be so happy-  I would be so happy in a post-apocalyptic world.  I would be.  I would love it.  Because then it would be-  I think that's your perfect scenario.  Me, and then I could shoot people.  No, you and the world shoot zombies.  Yeah, that'd be cool.  Hey, by the way, on vacation, I didn't bring this up.  Did anyone ever read I Am Legend?  No, but I loved the movie.  You loved that movie?  Loved it.  Hold on a minute.  I read-  Ridiculous.  I Am Legend. 
[02:22:00]  I picked it up at the airport before I went down to this Caribbean island that I like  to go to quite often.  Oh.  Oh.  They might be having some problems right now with sexual abuse.  Haiti?  No.  The Turks and the Caicos.  Oh, really?  I guess the big guy in charge is Naughty Naughty Boy.  Naughty Boy.  But anyway, I have a question for you about the book, though.  Was it based on the movie, or was it written before the movie?  I have not seen the movie yet, which is kind of strange. 
[02:22:30]  I like reading the book before the movie.  Just the opposite.  Really?  Really?  You like to go the other way.  Oh, God.  We should have our own talk show on TV.  Well, we could discuss-  Before and after.  Jimmy, I suggest you come over a little early tonight before we do official movie night  so we could discuss some of these things.  Okay.  And rekindle our friendship that is not doing too well these days.  I think it's doing great.  We were just very busy.  Actually, it is doing great because we don't hang out as much.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  I think that we have a very nice friendship.  Don't forget, we're in a position because literally we are creatively collaborating together 
[02:23:00]  for over five hours a day.  That's a very-  No one hangs out with friends for five hours a day.  And it feels like ten.  Absolutely.  What kind of sandwich is that?  It's turkey and American on white toast.  White toast.  Because I didn't have-  Because I like white bread.  White bread.  White bread.  What?  Can I see that?  No.  What?  Your white snot on it.  I know you.  You like the superior race bread.  So-  Hold on.  We're starting too many things.  I am rekind.  Okay.  And the other problem is that Jimmy and I are officially like neighbors. 
[02:23:30]  So, you know, there's a lot of looking the other way and running when we see each other.  Yeah.  That's completely not true.  Oh, that's just one side of-  Yes.  I've always happened to see you or your chick walk-in.  I would always come over and say hello.  But never run the other way.  I am legend.  So I pick up the book.  I guess it's a legendary author.  It's Richard Matheson or something like that.  And he wrote science fiction, right?  And I am legend, they tricked me because I pick up the book from my plane ride and I'm 
[02:24:00]  reading I am legend.  And it was unbelievable.  It was a great read until the book just ends, even though there's another hundred pages in  the actual book.  And I turn the page and I start reading another short story by the same author.  Oh, that's fucked up.  And I had to read the entire story where I finally realized, wait a minute.  This isn't part of the book.  This guy is a schizo.  What happened to the story I was reading?  Turns out I am legend is only like a hundred pages. 
[02:24:30]  The story, the original story is only a hundred pages or so.  Wow.  Maybe a hundred and ten.  And the book I bought was about 240 pages.  And it's just getting really good.  And the book ends.  It just ends.  How does it end?  Don't tell him.  Make him watch it.  No, I don't care.  I watched the movie.  Didn't you love the movie?  No, I liked the movie.  You loved that movie?  Loved it.  It was ridiculous.  The book sucked.  When do you think they built that big fucking wall around the town in Vermont? 
[02:25:00]  That's where Rich has his big problem.  When did they have time to build that big wall in Vermont at the compound at the end?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll explain.  Maybe the big wall was built when they knew things were falling apart.  Maybe in the three years that he had been in New York, maybe they built the wall then.  Then how come those zombies weren't getting in there in those three years killing the people?  Because maybe they were somehow protecting themselves the way he was.  There's a wall.  He couldn't protect himself.  They came in through the...  You see how he tried to protect himself and how vulnerable he was? 
[02:25:30]  Because they followed her.  Yeah, but they were vulnerable to bullets.  And when they opened the fucking door to the gate, you have two military guys.  They had guns.  There was a society there that could protect themselves.  I mean, some of it was cool.  I mean, but some of it was so far-fetched and hokey.  You know, the fact that Will Smith was the last living man in New York didn't bother Rich.  It was the wall in Vermont.  What is the matter with you?  What didn't you like about Close Encounters?  The fact that Dreyfuss got too much mileage on his pickup truck?  That's another one, too.  That bro that drove up from fucking wherever, Virginia. 
[02:26:00]  From Maryland.  Yeah, well, I got to see the movie.  Hopefully the movie's a lot better than the book.  This book, in my opinion, just ended.  It was like, come on.  You just developed a really great story, and then it just ends.  And then there's like seven or eight short stories that you get to read by the same author.  But they don't tell you that on the front cover of the book.  They just, you'd think the whole thing's I Am Legend.  Right.  Well, I got my esteemed colleague, Kenny.  I said, you got to see this movie.  I loved it.  310 of Yuma was the best this year. 
[02:26:30]  The best movie.  Kenny, what did you think of I Am Legend?  You didn't even listen to that.  I didn't know there was a wall around Vermont.  I saw the alternate ending.  Okay, don't tell me.  Thanks.  There's an alternate ending?  Yeah, it's on the TV.  Don't tell me.  I haven't seen it yet.  And Jimmy insists that I watch that scary monster movie.  I gave him the wrong version.  I gave him the alternate ending version.  But the fucking thing is, he goes the next day, he watched half of it, and he goes, it was  a monster movie.  A monster movie.  What is this, 1950?  It's more than a monster movie. 
[02:27:00]  It was scary.  There were monsters in it.  He's a fucking big Frady Cat.  Kenny can't watch scary movies.  You're right.  Good for you.  Those Exorcist or Devil movies, I wouldn't watch any of them.  Do you watch those?  What are you, a fucking homo?  No.  Oh, that's me.  Well, how come you don't like the fuck it up?  You watch that kind of shit, the devil, and all that Sixth Sense and all that bullshit.  Sixth Sense was brilliant, yeah.  It's too creepy, man.  The Exorcist is amazing.  Yeah, that's what made me stop after that one.  The Ring's scary.  My chick won't fucking watch scary movies either. 
[02:27:30]  I hate it.  It's like, don't you love being scared?  It's fucking fun.  Like, her favorite thing is that I scare the shit out of her all the time.  My girlfriend's like, what do you give her a blood test?  Oh, boss.  Nice.  That was a good one.  Mark that one.  She's actually the easiest person to scare, because whenever she leaves the room, I'll  kind of, I just lurk, and when she walks back in, I'm still.  I don't jump out at her.  I pose, and my mouth open, like, and when she walks in, all of a sudden, she just looks,  and I'm there. 
[02:28:00]  That's scarier than jumping out and going, boo.  She screams every fucking time.  Can you get that on video?  I tried to.  The one time, I waited outside the bathroom.  She didn't have any fucking metamucinus system.  It was quite a trip, and fucking, she finally comes out at three in the morning, and I  got my fucking camera with video on, and I'm in scary position.  She went, I'm like, could you have made a fucking noise the one time I'm taping?  Oh, she didn't.  And I ate a box.  Why don't you get under your bed?  When she goes to the bathroom at night, put, like, pillows like you're sleeping, and then  crawl under the bed and reach up and grab her. 
[02:28:30]  Why don't I just walk around the bed?  Why would I crawl under the dusty fucking bed?  She's sleeping.  Why don't I fucking build a hovering machine and float over and drop my asshole onto her  nose?  You know, it's a really scary scene in movies that they do is, let's say somebody's sitting  on a couch or in a car or whatever they're doing, and the camera kind of follows them  down where they tie their shoe or pick something up off the floor, and then they sit back up  and the camera follows them up, and there's someone just sitting next to them then instantly 
[02:29:00]  like that.  That scares the shit out of me.  Halloween did that a lot.  Yeah.  That's brilliant filmmaking right there.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Hey, so going back to the car thing, Anthony, like, we don't need oil anymore.  We need to find other ways to, like, drive around, and the reason most people don't buy  hybrid cars is because they're a bit faggoty.  Yeah.  They're coming out with a whole new line of hybrid cars that are a little less faggoty.  If we put all our attention to, like, hybrid cars and stuff, you're talking about spaceships  you're going to be driving around in. 
[02:29:30]  Like, just cool spaceships with wheels.  Bless you.  With all sorts of cool gadgetry in them.  I like muscle cars.  I like fast cars.  All right.  Maybe they'll develop that.  I don't want to be driving the same car with the same technology that we had fucking 20  years ago, 100 years ago at this point.  I don't know.  I just know there's a lot of oil still that we're just not digging up.  We're not refining it.  They shut down a bunch of our refineries.  I mean, because environmentalists say, you know, we've got to shut this down. 
[02:30:00]  We can't have this many things.  What about the...  I'm with Anthony.  Just start pumping oil.  Yeah, but I don't want to drive the same old thing.  How are you going to switch the whole...  The only difference is we've got GPS now.  That's it.  After 20 some odd years, we've got some fancy gadget in there now.  The internal combustion engine has been very good to people.  How about just go with, like, how about hovercrafts?  It's a little bigger.  Hovercraft technology could be cool.  How are we going to get hovercrafts?  Why not?  Yeah, that'll save on repairing roadways.  You don't have to worry about potholes and stuff. 
[02:30:30]  There you go.  That's true.  It's like everybody plays bumper cars on the way to work.  That's fine.  Get the bumpers.  Make them big or something.  Because the flying car is never going to happen.  Because people are too stupid.  No, you can't trust people.  Society in general, we're just a bunch of dummies.  Fall out of the sky.  Hovercrafts, though.  Like you said, bumper cars.  We can handle that.  Do you know when those will happen?  Huh?  We will eventually colonize the moon and probably one of the moons of Jupiter.  Maybe by 1975.  No.  That passed, Anthony.  Yeah, what movie was that in? 
[02:31:00]  I was, you know.  I Am Legend.  I Am Legend, yeah.  In the book.  Oh, really?  In the book, yeah, it was supposed to be something like that.  Once we colonize and there's no gravity, then the flying cars will take it.  It's just an impact.  Oh, so then we can't fall.  Yeah, I mean.  But then you could, like, wing on out into space and be lost.  No, they'll fight me in a car.  What's that?  There's no gravity.  You don't really need a car.  You can just kind of float.  You can kind of just take off on your own.  All right, whatever.  You're right.  You're right.  Maybe that's right.  I can't believe I fucking came up with that.  Here's the thing, too, about the oil.  It's just cars.  You can't change the whole system in a whole country. 
[02:31:30]  Everything runs on fucking oil.  Just because of cars.  The whole power system.  Everything runs on oil.  You're not going to just change the whole fucking world.  And then you spoil it.  You know, of course you can't change it.  No, you can't.  That's what change is.  It might take some time.  It does take time.  It takes time.  We get a lot of power.  DVDs in four years.  You have to.  The bottom line is ExxonMobil.  And I'm not some of these conspiracy things.  But their interest is for us to use oil.  All the oil companies who are extraordinarily powerful.  Their interest is in keeping it. 
[02:32:00]  And Hellman's interest is for us to use mayonnaise.  Okay, so big deal.  Well, the difference is Hellman's isn't depleting our natural resources  and fucking deep-dicking the environment  like it's a fucking passed-out fat girl at a party.  Yeah.  It's a reality.  The environment is kind of shitty.  I wish you ain't enough for the environment.  We get a lot of power, too, from waterfalls.  Yeah.  So we ought to put a little power plant on Rich's chin.  Yeah.  I was agreeing the whole time with you.  Okay.  Dude, we have the fucking sun.  We have these ways of harnessing power, 
[02:32:30]  which we're not smart enough to do yet.  We're looking for gas.  We have to drill into the oil and liquid shit.  We have a fucking star we could use.  Jimmy, it's not that we're not smart enough.  To put a star in your gas tank.  Economically, we're not willing to use the sun as a power plant.  They have electric cars, but for whatever reason,  you're right, they are too faggy, but they do exist.  Yeah, what's the electricity run on power?  Fucking oil.  I don't know what electricity is.  Electricity. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, that's where it comes from.  Fucking oil and power.  But no one says that oil should be just never touched.  Gabby Voss is right.  No, Gabby Voss is not right.  Yes, he is fucking right.  Do you not think that...  And how dare you talk about sun, you no-pigment douchebag.  You know nothing about the sun.  Yes, I do.  It causes kidney tumors.  Fucking...  You do get a lot of sun, right?  And jizzbag.  You're obsessed with the sun.  You look like actually Christ would look.  Fucking hold you up at a concert, you gloated dark douchebag. 
[02:33:30]  What concerts do you go to?  Fucking Leonard Skinner's dead.  Nothing.  I was trying to think of old men concerts, but Leonard Skinner, I like.  I had no sincerity in that.  I'm sorry, Rich.  I'm glad you're okay.  Hey, I got it.  I'm going to say hi to Karen.  You motherfucker.  Karen in Australia.  Karen, how are you?  Oh.  Hi, darlings.  How are you?  Pretty good.  What's up, Karen?  What I wanted to do, I didn't want to make it this morning.  My son has actually been in the States three times in the last 18 months. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  And he's done the walkover with you guys.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  Oh, we know him.  We know him.  Yeah.  He's his Aussie boy.  Yeah.  He's what?  The boy from Down Under.  Yeah, I know.  He's a good mate.  We like him.  He's a good mate.  He's a good bloke.  And what I wanted to do, I was going to ask you guys, he actually celebrates his 21st birthday  on the 30th of April. 
[02:34:30]  So in two weeks.  Goodbye, McKay.  He's going to be 30 on the 21st?  Even though he has been out drinking with you guys before he was 21 in the States.  Don't know anything about that.  Never heard of that.  It makes it a bit illegal.  Yeah.  What are you going to do about it?  You're in Australia.  Like the Road Warrior.  Great movie.  What I was hoping to do is because Mick downcast the radio that you show every day, I was hoping 
[02:35:00]  you'd send him a happy 21st birthday.  Where are you from?  Melbourne?  I'm from Melbourne.  Yeah, of course.  I am.  We like your son.  And he will hear the show tomorrow morning.  Hold on, Matt.  And he'll bloody...  What a nice mom.  He's going to hear the show tomorrow morning, which is what?  Saturday for you guys?  Yeah, what the hell is it?  No, no.  Tomorrow morning will be Thursday.  And you're heading into winter?  What's wrong with you guys over there?  Why can't you just follow the rules?  You know what?  I was ready to...  The rules of the Northern Hemisphere.  I've been trying to get through the... 
[02:35:30]  You can't even figure out the fucking toilet thing.  You guys got to have the water rotate the other way, don't you?  Hold on, miss.  Let me ask you a question.  I like her.  She's calling for her son because she's a good mom.  Now...  I'm a good fucking mom.  Hold on a second.  I've got to listen to you fucking guys.  All right.  Shut up, you fucking bloody...  By the time you get done, it'll be his 22nd birthday.  I want to ask a question.  Yeah.  What would you be willing...  Are you asking me questions?  What would you be willing to do for us to wish your son a sincere happy birthday? 
[02:36:00]  Jimmy, now you're talking.  Because we would.  We want full snatch activity.  Have six at St. Patrick's Cathedral?  No, but would you be willing...  Six.  We don't know what six is.  Six.  Would you be willing...  I would do that.  One-third of the numbers on your head.  How about...  How about...  Yes, and your entire IQ.  How about we...  Here's another one, guys.  How about I would be...  I would actually be willing to replay Red Eye, the Suckerman with fucking Jimmy Norton on it. 
[02:36:30]  Thank you.  Would you be willing to perhaps...  Pugging mouth.  Maybe masturbate a little bit on the phone.  Yeah, a little masturbation would be good.  No.  Why don't you...  No.  No.  Why not?  Why don't we...  No, Nick said...  Why don't we play our favorite game...  Listen, Karen.  Karen, shut the fuck up.  Karen, hold on.  You're crazy.  The only reason we haven't hung up on you yet is because you're from the other side of the world.  Listen to me.  And we like your son.  Let's play our... 
[02:37:00]  Shut up for a second.  Karen, we're trying to...  Go ahead, Karen.  Go ahead, Karen.  I'm just letting you know...  You can't shut up, can you?  No.  No.  No.  I have to go...  I have to get up in six hours to go to work.  You're asleep now?  Six hours.  Get up in six hours.  That's what I'm called sleeping.  I know.  Yeah.  Why are you so fucking lazy?  Everyone else is working already.  So, all right.  Karen, I was asking you a question.  I can acknowledge they have different rules over there.  You're a lazy mum.  Yeah, I know.  Mum. 
[02:37:30]  Me mum.  You're lazy.  I want to play our favorite game called Down Under.  Okay.  Come on.  We'll play.  I'm ready.  All right.  It's called Guess What's in My Pants, also known as the Down Under game.  Down Under.  Yep.  Yep.  Ready.  Ready and willing.  G'day.  All right.  What are you wearing right now?  Oh, um, a bit of a little, um, I had my nurse's uniform on today.  We had, we had, um, vaccinations at work.  Nurses uniform.  We had flu vaccinations at work today, so I've got my nurse's uniform on. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  Not all the sexy talk at once.  They're still dealing with the flu over there.  We're out of flu season.  Karen.  All our rules.  Big thermometer.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Where are you?  I'm in my house.  Oh, are you?  Okay.  I can just picture a guy walking in and smashing him in the hill with a hammer.  Where am I going to be?  10 to 12 at night.  I'm not a word.  Wacky country.  Here's what you got to do.  Right.  Okay. 
[02:38:30]  Here's how we play Guess What's in My Pants.  Also known as the down under game.  Here's how we play.  I've got to.  You take.  You shut the fuck.  Note to self.  Punch her son in the face next time he comes to the States.  It's the closest we'll get to this.  Can I.  Can I.  Can I talk to you for a second?  You can go.  Okay.  Just try to try to keep a little quiet and listen to what I'm saying.  Okay.  Thank you.  Here it is.  You're going to take the telephone that you're talking in right now.  And when instructed, you will rub it on your vagina. 
[02:39:00]  Now, don't tell us your hairstyle down there.  Don't even hint to it right now or anything.  But just from the sound it makes, we are going to guess what type of hairstyle you have down there.  It's either a full triangle, a landing strip, a Hitler mustache, or a JonBenet Ramsey.  Oh, poor JonBenet.  Yes.  Now, do you understand how the game is played? 
[02:39:30]  I do.  Okay.  And could you take your pants?  What?  Hey, hey, excuse me.  What's my prize?  What do I win?  We're going to wish you a happy birthday.  You get to talk to radio stars.  Your son gets a happy birthday.  That's your prize.  And you get to be a radio star down under for a day.  And you're a cool mom.  JonBenet Ramsey, does that mean her pussy's dead in the basement?  No, it means her pussy has a cowboy hat on the cliff.  It's like Garrett tied around.  It's Libya.  He's going to die tomorrow when he's going to die. 
[02:40:00]  You're gone?  Wait, no, let's do it.  Okay.  All right, hold on.  Ready?  What?  No, no, hold on.  We run this.  Jesus Christ.  Not your show, Elias.  Here's how it works.  We will play the theme song.  You will sit there and be quiet.  Then we will instruct you to rub the phone in various ways, shapes, and forms.  Then we will guess.  And then you will tell us.  Remember, I've got to bring the phone up again so I can hear it.  I've got to mobile phone. 
[02:40:30]  Right, right.  Don't worry.  Oh, my God.  No one's ever screwed this up.  No one's ever screwed this up.  You could be the first.  Wait, you have a mobile phone.  How are you going to hear it?  Oh, Jimmy, shut up.  Don't get us started.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, you're the only smart one, right?  How am I going to hear it?  I don't know.  How long do I rub before I bring the phone back up?  Stop being a fucking cunt.  Don't be a cunt.  So how are you going to hear us if you're on a mobile phone, though?  Exactly.  Food, all right.  Jimmy, Jimmy, how long do I have to rub before I bring the phone back up?  Hold on.  Five minutes.  No, no, no. 
[02:41:00]  Just a couple of times, like up and down, three times or something.  I'm amazed you're still trying.  I get it.  You're insane.  Hold on, hold on.  I just love being annoyed.  That's why.  You're insane.  So just hold on.  We're going to play the song, and then you're going to...  Up and down, up and down, up and down.  Don't talk.  Don't talk yet.  Right.  Okay.  I'm not going to talk.  Don't talk.  And here comes the theme song.  Go.  Wait, wait, wait.  No.  Sharon?  No, don't. 
[02:41:30]  You suck.  No, shut up.  Hold on, Sharon.  Jimmy, shut the fuck up.  Jimmy, shut the fuck up.  Karen, look here.  Look at me.  Karen.  Karen, that's all we had.  No, we're going to...  I was thinking.  I want to play the song.  Oh, no, no.  Karen, Karen, Karen.  I was watching the replay of Red Eye.  No, forget about Red Eye.  What is Red Eye?  Red Eye.  We want to talk about Brown Eye. 
[02:42:00]  I'll give you a pink sock, you fucking...  Listen to me.  Listen.  Yeah, I'm listening.  Be quiet while the song plays.  Why are you trying?  Okay?  No matter...  No, no, no.  Karen, listen to me.  Listen to me.  Please, please.  Two seconds.  No matter what Jimmy says...  I love the right news.  Please say, Karen.  Holy mother of Christ on a pony.  Hey, lady, die.  Yeah.  Say, Karen.  It's lady down under.  Listen to me.  Say, Karen.  Please, Karen, listen to me.  Karen.  Karen, listen.  Please, please. 
[02:42:30]  Just be quiet while the song plays.  Don't listen to Jimmy.  If he asks you anything, just remain quiet until the song's over, okay?  Thank you for watching Red Eye.  And here comes the song.  Did you like it?  It's something you planned for.  No!  You shut the fuck up.  No, you gotta shut up.  Karen.  We haven't played this song in over a year.  People want to hear the song.  Karen, did you hear me say...  You don't want to hear it.  No, did you hear me say don't talk? 
[02:43:00]  Remember?  Do you remember?  No.  Like two seconds ago...  Remember, there's a 35-second delay between New York and Melbourne.  Yeah, but not over the phone.  Listen to the phone, not the radio.  Just shut the fuck up.  So listen, listen, listen, listen.  Don't talk.  We're gonna play...  I'm gonna...  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  I wanna...  I wanna...  I wanna kill her.  I wanna kill her.  Karen, take her...  I wanna kill her.  I wanna fucking kill her.  Listen to me. 
[02:43:30]  You're lying because I couldn't get through, right?  Karen.  Why couldn't you?  Karen, shut up, Jimmy.  Karen.  Karen.  Karen, please.  Please, Karen.  Please, listen to me.  Can you listen, please?  Please, Karen.  Okay, listen to me.  Listen very closely.  I'm gonna play...  No!  When someone says listen,  you don't go,  I'm listening.  You just listen.  Just, Karen, Karen, listen to this.  Now, please, listen.  We're gonna play the...  I'm gonna stand, God.  Karen, Karen.  Will you shut the fuck up?  Karen, listen to me, please, for a second.  We're gonna play the...  Holy shit.  We're gonna play the 
[02:44:00]  Guess What's In My Pants song.  Now, that's an intro to the game  that you're gonna participate in.  Now, while the song's playing,  you can't talk, okay?  All right?  Please?  Well, how do I know  what's in my pants?  No, no, hold on.  Right.  You can't hear you.  No, Jimmy, don't...  And don't listen to Jimmy.  Jimmy's trying to...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I can't...  She's right.  Remember once I said,  I want to go to Australia?  Yeah.  I never, ever want to go there.  Of course not.  Listen to me, Karen. 
[02:44:30]  Karen.  Hey, darling,  you want to come down here?  Karen.  Karen.  Listen to me, please.  Don't...  Don't talk during the song,  no matter who asks you anything.  Okay?  Okay.  Now, we're going to play the song.  Let's play the song.  All right.  Here comes the song.  You know what, though?  You guys,  we love you guys, Jimmy.  Thank you.  We're playing the song.  Oh, my God.  Could you just...  Karen, please don't talk.  Okay, please don't talk.  Okay, play the...  Now, just let the song...  Karen.  He says, don't speak, don't speak. 
[02:45:00]  And I think, why?  Karen, Karen, Karen,  don't say anything.  Now we know why your son comes to the stage  just to get away from your fucking house.  Karen, don't say anything  while the song's playing.  Okay.  Okay, all right.  From right now,  don't say anything.  Please say it.  From right now, okay.  No, no, that means just...  No, no, no.  She was doing it.  Don't say anything.  All right.  I'm not, Jimmy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Karen, don't talk from right now  until you hear my voice again.  No matter who talks, okay?  Right now, don't say anything. 
[02:45:30]  Play the song.  Thanks for watching.  Do you like this song?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  This one's in my past.  Place my receiver.  Karen.  Upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  No.  No, we got 15 seconds into the song.  God damn it, Jimmy.  No, Karen, I told you. 
[02:46:00]  Don't answer Jimmy.  Why did you answer him?  I said, don't talk until I say something.  My head hurts.  He told me not to fucking talk.  I'm not talking.  But you started talking during the song.  You'd have to fuck her head between a mattress and a box.  No, I didn't.  It was Jimmy.  It was Jimmy.  No, it sounded like you, Ant.  I'm only seeing Pleasant.  We won't ask you.  Oh, my God.  Let's try this again.  Okay.  I'm going to have some nice...  Okay.  Karen, Karen, Karen. 
[02:46:30]  Don't talk until I say, okay, Karen, we're ready to play.  Okay?  So don't talk until you hear that.  I'm going to play the song now.  Don't say a word.  Can I still put something?  Can I still put the fun in my pants?  Yes, but not yet.  Wait until the song's over.  The song is the intro to the bit.  So you have to be quiet.  Okay.  Don't say a word.  And don't listen to Jimmy at all.  Wait.  Until what, Ant?  Until I say...  No.  What?  Karen?  No.  No.  Until I say...  Right.  What? 
[02:47:00]  We're ready to play the game.  Okay.  All right.  We got it.  Let's play the song.  Don't talk until you hear Anthony say what?  We're ready to play the game.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  All right.  No, don't talk to Jimmy.  Don't talk to Jimmy.  Let me play the song.  Be quiet.  Here comes a song.  No.  Here comes a song.  Be quiet.  Be quiet.  Here we go.  Play the song.  What?  Thanks for watching.  Jimmy.  No.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Shut up.  Why are you talking?  What, Karen? 
[02:47:30]  Karen.  Jimmy.  Karen.  Jimmy.  Karen.  Jimmy.  Yes.  Jimmy.  Karen.  What are you talking to Jimmy for?  Are you out of your mind?  You're, oh, you're drunk.  Let's play what drunk she's on.  Look, I love Opie.  I love Anthony.  I love you guys.  But he's coming to Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  I've got a signed t-shirt of you.  Karen.  Oh, she's got a signed t-shirt.  Karen.  We've got a signed t-shirt. 
[02:48:00]  Karen.  It's all about us.  Karen.  Karen.  Yes.  We want to play a game called Guess What's in My Pants with you.  Right.  Okay.  You've got to tell me what my prize is.  Are you going to fly me over to New York?  Listen.  I'm pretty hot.  I'd like to fly you.  I'd like to fly you to L.A. on Oceanic.  Flight 8.  Fucking, what's the flight number?  815.  You fuck.  Listen to me.  Listen, I have a nurse's uniform, and I can fly over there, and I can see Jimmy. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  Listen.  No, you've got to listen.  Try to listen.  Try to listen.  Okay.  Try to listen.  All right.  We're going to play the game.  I'll listen.  It's time to play the game.  Okay.  We're going to play the song.  Right now.  You are going to be quiet during the entire song now, no matter what anyone.  You want me to put my phone on?  Yay.  No, not yet.  Play the song, and then nobody talks during the song.  That means you, Jimmy, no one talks.  What?  No, he was evil.  Don't listen. 
[02:49:00]  Just let the song play.  Let the song play.  Let the song play.  Put on a room with six high school girls.  Just let the song play, Karen.  Please be quiet.  Please.  Please.  I'm begging you.  I'm begging you.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Now, don't say.  Only because I love you all.  All right.  Thank you.  Don't say another word now until you hear me say, all right, Karen.  Okay?  And Jimmy, shut up. 
[02:49:30]  But don't.  Don't.  Yeah.  Don't listen to Jimmy.  Don't answer anybody.  Just let the song play.  Jimmy's in the background.  Don't listen to him.  Karen.  Stop it, Karen.  All right.  Sorry.  All right.  Calling me.  Karen, be quiet.  I'll listen.  All right.  Listen to the song.  I'll listen.  Here we go.  Okay.  Be quiet.  Song playing now.  Be quiet and song.  Okay, Karen.  No.  Holy fuckaroni.  I told you don't listen to Jimmy.  Don't talk during the song. 
[02:50:00]  You're ruining everything.  Why do you do this?  Why are you doing this?  Karen.  He's going to be in one floor over the cuckoo's nest with just a bunch of dicks.  He started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  Jimmy, you're obviously lovely.  I hit him back.  I'm really angry.  I did walk with you guys.  Keep out of it. 
[02:50:30]  You don't know how I feel.  Karen.  Listen to me.  Karen.  Karen.  We're going to play the song.  We're going to play the song.  Okay.  All right.  Don't talk.  But nothing right now.  It's the easiest part for you right now.  Nothing.  Because you're to do nothing.  Explain everything.  Don't talk.  What do I win?  Right.  We'll give you.  I don't know.  We'll find something in the prize closet.  But just listen to me.  Explain everything.  Explain the Jimmy part.  I'm really trying to.  Jimmy's trying to throw her off.  Yes.  Yes.  Jimmy's fucking with you. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Now, when the song is playing, Karen.  Put Jimmy on just for one minute.  No.  Oh, Karen.  Hey, I'm Chris.  I'm right here.  Oh, God.  What hon?  What hon?  Jimmy.  All right.  Let her get it out of her system.  Tell Jimmy what you want to tell him.  Go ahead.  Jimmy.  Yes, baby.  Go ahead.  Jimmy, I love you.  Thank you.  I've seen you.  I watched you on Red Eye tonight.  Right.  We know.  I love you from afar.  Right.  I've always adored you.  I've got all your DVDs.  I wish you loved them from a coffin. 
[02:51:30]  You're telling me, when you talk to me, I'm not allowed to answer you.  What's going on?  I don't know.  It's just crazy.  What is this?  Okay.  All right, Karen.  You got it out of your system.  All right.  Good.  You got it out of your system.  We're back.  You got to listen to me.  We're back.  I'm going to play some music.  Oh, thanks, sweetheart.  You have to be really quiet during the song.  Don't say one word.  But you're talking to me, and I answer you.  No, Jimmy talks to you.  He's trying to screw you up.  No matter what you hear during the song, do not answer it.  That's the object of the first part of the game.  If you don't answer it, you've won the first round, okay? 
[02:52:00]  A night with Jimmy?  You'll win a prize if you don't answer anybody, and let the song play through without saying  a word, okay?  Red eyes aren't enough straight.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, George.  Here it comes now.  Don't say a word.  Don't say a word.  Okay.  Play the song.  It's time to play.  It's time to play. 
[02:52:30]  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pass?  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  God damn it.  Why did you talk that time?  Why did you talk?  Even Jimmy was behaving.  Why did you talk during the song?  I didn't talk.  You did.  You said, oh, my God, what's that?  Or something.  What?  It's that fucking lady when you ring and you ask for a phone number in Melbourne, Australia. 
[02:53:00]  It was her.  Right.  No, it wasn't.  It was you.  It was her.  I didn't say anything.  You did, too.  I did not.  All right.  Maybe she did.  Maybe the...  All right.  Let's try it one more time.  Don't say a word.  This is it.  We'll play the song.  Don't say a word.  That's right.  Starting right now.  If you want more air time, you've got to listen to Anthony.  All right.  Play the music.  Here we go.  T-T-T.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to play.  Karen?  Yes?  I think what's in my pants.  No.  There was two words left.  My pants.  My pants?  No.  Why did you talk?  Karen.  I did talk.  Yes, you did.  I did talk.  You said fucking something.  I did not.  No, Sharon.  I did not talk. 
[02:54:00]  Now you're a lying cunt.  You did say something.  God, it must take her a month to give head.  All right, Karen.  You talked.  You talked during the song.  Do you know why I talked?  Because I've...  Do you want to know why I talked?  Why, baby?  Why?  What date is it today, guys?  What date is it today?  What date?  Hopefully Armageddon.  Who knows?  It's Australia.  It could be Saturday for all we know.  Now, listen.  I am a believer, right?  I am a believer. 
[02:54:30]  I emailed all of you.  We got it.  I sent my email to everyone, and you all said you all read your email.  I've copied it.  I sent the email for the last 30 fucking days, and I have not received a reply.  Right.  I don't believe you, guys.  Well, what happened was, we had replies ready, and the power shut off because I had a long  two-page email reply written to your question, madam.  Tell me you've got a few fans.  I don't know.  That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
[02:55:00]  You are the most annoying bitch on the face of this fucking earth.  Oh, please.  You're not...  You don't shut up for a second.  How are you still alive?  What?  Why didn't your husband kill you?  She's not in New Zealand.  She has a beautiful party.  I would choke you.  I wouldn't even do anything like a shooting.  It would have to be so personal.  I would choke you and bite your nipples off so that when the police showed up, they'd go, 
[02:55:30]  wow, this is really personal.  Somebody really hated her.  This is someone that really hated, like, and I would pose you.  I'd pose you in a death position so the police would show up and go, wow, this psychopath  hated this fucking woman.  I'd bite your fucking vagina out.  I'd bite it out and spit it down your fucking throat.  That's the game.  Because you won't shut the fuck up.  That's the game.  Guess what's in my mouth.  And you made me shut up in that one.  No, I didn't.  I couldn't make you shut up.  He tried.  You wouldn't shut up. 
[02:56:00]  Are we saying goodbye to this broad?  No.  I want to know what's in her pants.  Let's play the theme song.  Just don't talk.  You know what it is?  No.  Just don't talk.  Are you naked yet?  Yes.  There you go.  And we don't have beavers in Australia.  We don't have beavers in Australia.  We have platypus.  Oh, my gosh.  Is she making jokes now?  Because she had a talk during the pod that says, place the receiver upon your beaver.  No, it's a platypus.  It's a platypus.  Because you can't shut up.  All right.  You're getting one more chance. 
[02:56:30]  And then I swear to God, I'm lunging over the board and hanging this fucking phone up.  Listen to me.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  This is it.  Don't talk.  This is it, right, Ann?  That's right.  This is it, right, Ann?  She's waiting.  This is it, right, Ann?  No talking or we'll kill your neek.  I'm coming over there and I'm ripping your pubic hair out.  I shave mine.  Oh, don't talk.  No, you'll ruin the bitch. 
[02:57:00]  Holy shit.  I shave everything.  You don't?  No, don't answer.  Because it's part of the game.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It's Guess What's in My Pants.  We got to guess what's in your stupid fucking pants.  Listen to me.  Don't talk during the song, okay?  Hopefully a Wolverine.  Oh, and another one of these fucking...  Tasmanian devil.  Okay, go on.  All right, listen.  Don't talk.  Here comes the song.  Let's...  Don't talk.  Song.  Go.  But what if Tim talks to me?  I won't.  No one's going to talk to you. 
[02:57:30]  No matter what you hear, it's not for you.  That's right.  Your job is to remain quiet during the entire song.  I won't talk to you.  Don't talk to Jimmy, motherfucker.  Holy shit, do I hate you.  Okay, go on.  All right, don't...  Don't...  Don't talk, okay?  Go.  Here comes the song.  What am I supposed to do?  Just sit there and be quiet for the length of the song.  Which is a mere 30 seconds.  Holy shit, the song's 30 seconds.  Something like that.  Fucking long.  Just shut up for 30...  Just be quiet, okay?  I will talk to you. 
[02:58:00]  Listen to the song.  Be quiet.  Do I have to talk at any stage during the song?  Not during the song.  After the song.  After the song, you talk all you want.  But right now...  How will I know when the song ends?  I will say, okay, Karen, it's time to play the game.  Unless you hear that, don't say a word.  All right, we can...  Until you hear...  Unless...  Until you hear, okay, Karen, it's time to play the...  Wait till we're done with the song and I'll tell you. 
[02:58:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  That's tricky.  That's being very silly.  People are crashing our cars.  What do I get if I win?  Oh, my God.  I want to fucking choke you.  I want to rip out your fucking voice box  and shove it down your throat  so it's where it was when I ripped it out  and rip it out again.  Do you want to rip out her pubic hair, Anthony?  Oh, through her asshole.  From the roots at the front.  I want to reach through her asshole 
[02:59:00]  to the front to her pubic mound  and grind away at it  until I find little pubic hair roots  and then pull them in.  Into her fucking...  Into her fucking...  And out her asshole.  Remember I told you I was Nurse Cody today  because we had our influenza injections?  I'll actually ask you...  I don't give a...  I hope you fucking inadvertently  poked yourself with 10 AIDS needles.  I hope you fucking got AIDS today.  Why don't you shut up?  Up! 
[02:59:30]  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up!  for a fucking song!  Could you shut the fuck up,  you cunt!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Holy mother of fuck!  Shut up!  Holy shit!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[03:00:00]  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut up!  Anal thermometer!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Come on, Jimmy.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Okay?  Hey, Jimmy.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  What is the difference between  an anal thermometer  and a...  Oh, my God.  Anal thermometer.  Oh, my God.  I want...  I'm going to jump out the window.  She's beating me.  I'm going to kill myself.  I say we play the song 
[03:00:30]  and she'll be quiet for it.  Have some faith.  Karen!  I'm playing...  I'm playing a song.  Be quiet during the song.  Please.  Don't answer anybody.  Okay?  Go.  Go.  Song.  No!  God.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Oh.  Shh.  We'll talk after the song.  We'll talk after the song, Karen.  After the song.  Go.  Here's the song.  And go.  It's time to play. 
[03:01:00]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Shut up, you fucking asshole.  Shut up.  Right.  Why don't you understand this?  Why don't you understand what's going on?  Because you guys are too nice.  You haven't nuked us yet.  Jesus.  What?  We think we've got a...  We think we've always got a second chance.  You haven't nuked us yet. 
[03:01:30]  That's right with the war and stuff, right?  What the fuck are you talking about?  I don't know, man.  Listen to me.  I just want to...  You know, you haven't come over and nuked us, so...  Oh, nuked us.  We can, you know, make you laugh a couple of times.  Why would we want to nuke Australia?  It's so out of the way.  Oh.  What are we going to take from your...  All right.  Play it again.  What am I playing for, though?  Is this like Jeopardy?  Right.  Yeah, it's just like Jeopardy.  Just wait till the song's over. 
[03:02:00]  Karen, it's really not...  I wish you were raped by the fucking Mohawk guy in the Road Warrior.  Nice.  All right, Karen, it's not funny anymore.  Just shut your fucking mouth.  Just shut your fucking mouth.  Just shut your fucking mouth.  You've got to shut up.  Just shut your fucking mouth.  It's not funny anymore.  It's not funny anymore.  Shut your fucking mouth.  Shut your pie hole.  It's not funny anymore.  It's not funny anymore.  Shut the fuck up.  I'd like to silence her. 
[03:02:30]  Shut up.  Please.  Like that big German silenced that Jew in Saving Private Ryan.  Yeah, trust us.  It's not funny anymore.  It was funny for a while,  but now we want to play the fucking game,  so shut up.  No, seriously.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You don't get it.  Shut up.  It's not funny anymore.  Let us play the fucking song.  Shut up.  It was funny for 15 fucking minutes,  but it's not funny anymore.  It wasn't even funny for 15 minutes.  It was extremely annoying.  Let's play the fucking song. 
[03:03:00]  Shut up.  Be quiet.  Here comes the song.  I love it.  I love it.  I'm getting my own back.  Come on.  I'm ready.  I'm ready for you guys.  Come on.  Throw it at me.  What do I have to do again?  Be quiet.  Put the drink down.  Just be quiet.  All right.  For how long?  Till the song plays.  Okay.  Okay.  Thanks.  Is that even if Jimmy talks to me?  Yes.  I won't talk to you.  Don't.  Don't talk.  Go.  Here comes the song.  You're not going to talk to me, Jimmy. 
[03:03:30]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Guess what's in my...  I can't believe it.  I know what you're doing.  Guess what?  It's not funny anymore.  Now it's annoying.  I don't think she's trying.  It's not fucking funny.  We get it.  As soon as the song plays,  you're going to start talking.  Shut the fuck up.  It's not even funny anymore.  Don't you get humor at all?  I do. 
[03:04:00]  Then shut the fuck up.  We've just had the Melbourne Comedy Festival.  Shut the fuck up.  Dude, she honestly isn't...  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy, shut up.  Who books that?  She isn't even doing this on purpose.  See, she didn't know her in the beginning,  and then she realized somewhere along the line,  so then she decided,  okay, I'll talk every time they play the song.  Guess what, Karen?  We're at the stage now where it's not fucking funny,  so shut up.  I don't think she is.  I think she's retarded.  Just shut the fuck up.  Okay.  I am retarded. 
[03:04:30]  That means shut up.  When I say shut the fuck up,  that means shut up.  Okay.  All right.  Shut the fuck up.  Hey, guys.  We'll find another...  I'm really sorry.  I didn't mean to be on the show  because I was retarded.  I'm sorry for sending my retarded son over to the state.  She's drunk.  Even though I did send him over  when the dollar was really, really low,  which was great.  He got a really good return.  The cunt the size of a Foster's can.  And if you can find it in your hearts, 
[03:05:00]  I know you can't  because I've really pissed you off tonight,  but the young lad turned 21 on the 30th of April.  Can we know?  Which is Wednesday, the 30th of April,  your time and our time.  We were going to wish him a happy birthday,  but you blew it.  He's going to actually...  You blew it, Mom.  You blew it.  We were going to wish him a happy birthday,  so he'll hear all of this.  And if you don't wish him a happy birthday,  I think he might come over and retaliate.  You blew it.  I hope he dies on his birthday.  You blew it. 
[03:05:30]  We were going to do it, but you blew it.  Hey, guys.  I hope you get a phone call in the middle of the night.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, guys.  What was his name?  It's his first birthday.  He's dead.  Nick Cody.  How dare you not remember him?  I don't remember him.  He's probably from down under.  Oh, so he's from where?  Florida?  He had to go to the other side of the world  to get the fuck away from you.  The Aussie boy that did the walkover  three times in 18 months.  Rub the phone on your pubic hair.  And he did all of that.  He's the boy from Australia.  Ram the phone down your fucking...  Right now, Travis and Danny  look like the lucky ones. 
[03:06:00]  But, hey, listen, guys.  Nothing.  See?  They don't have mothers.  Oh.  I'd like to say,  I do love your show.  Can I do this?  Do you love your humor?  Simon?  Things are great.  And, um...  She'll probably ramble on for hours,  let's say.  And you enjoy.  And, you know,  you're ready to go home  and enjoy your day.  It's now 12.30pm  here in the morning  and I've got to go to sleep  to get up 
[03:06:30]  to get ready for work  in four hours.  Boo-hoo?  Did I hear a boo-hoo?  Good night, guys.  I could have talked to her  for a week.  I thought we did. 
[03:07:00]  She's...  Holy shit.  She's arguably  the worst person ever.  The worst person ever.  You know,  I was going to say,  like, caller  or a thing.  But you're right.  She is the worst person ever.  What the fuck was...  Oh, my God.  She wouldn't shut the fuck up.  That was interesting  on so many levels.  I feel beaten down.  I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  Stupefied?  I can't...  I'm so angry.  But are you stupefied? 
[03:07:30]  I feel refreshed.  Yeah, I'm like tired almost.  I'm going to go take a look.  It's like I had a massage.  It's true,  but instead of by two relaxing hands,  it was by the vocal hordes.  Vocal hordes.  Yes, there are many vocal cords in there.  What kind of massage?  Full release?  Yeah, full release.  That's what I feel like.  I feel like,  oh, I'm tired now.  With a gentleman's finger  in your backside?  Mm-hmm.  That feels really good  and then extremely uncomfortable  as soon as the load is up.  It's amazing how fast that turns.  Oh, God, that feels good. 
[03:08:00]  I can't...  I can't...  I like the voice of experience  over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so hot.  It's so hot.  As soon as it's on your belly,  pull your shit finger out of my tuchus  and go fucking scrape  under the nail  under the sink  and we'll both avoid eye contact  and hit the bricks, brother.  Sister.  I know.  No, brother.  Because there's a guy.  I get gross.  Oh, all right.  But it's just annoying  because it feels so good.  Yeah.  It feels so good.  There's always that moment  where you think you're in a shit,  but you don't.  Really?  What's the biggest thing  you've had in your ass? 
[03:08:30]  Your tongue.  All right, let's all take leave.  I'll give you the biggest thing  I've had in my ass  in order of size.  I've had the pinky of a baby,  a strand of grass,  and then your cock.  A strand of grass.  I love that.  I thought I felt grass in there. 
[03:09:00]  All right, let's just say a blade.  A strand of grass.  Glass.  Grass.  What?  I have no idea.  Oh, she beat me down,  that fucking woman.  Oh, she better not show up  at the fucking Arlington  fucking super draft house  in Virginia this weekend.  Happy birthday, Nick.  She fucking...  She earned it.  Yeah, she certainly did.  All right, let's take a break.  Let's go make tickles.  Great bang.  Hello, is this Australia?  Is Corey there?  I'm trying to call a continent. 
[03:09:30]  Who would you like me?  His name is Corey.  Do you have a last name?  No, but he's the guy  from the news clip.  Huh?  Corey, the man on the computer.  He has delicious,  delicious nipple rings  and a smooth chest.  Like me.  Could you please  connect me with him?  Oh, hello.  This is Corey.  It's him.  It sounds...  He's got an accent.  Hi, do you have an X, Sam?  Huh?  Okay, good.  Could you talk to Opie and Anthony?  And that's how you executive produce. 
[03:10:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony,  Jim Norton,  Rich Voss.  All trying to entertain you today.  Rich Voss playing a comedy club  in Arlington, Virginia.  Cinema Draft House.  What is it?  Arlington Cinema and Draft House.  Draft House.  Cinema, yeah.  Beer and movies type of thing? 
[03:10:30]  I don't know.  It's pretty cool.  I looked at their lineup.  They've got some pretty cool comics  that work there.  Kindler worked there.  Paul Tompkins.  A college student asked McCain  about the Hillary Clinton  drinking video.  Oh, we're on the air.  More knowledge,  but the who cares factor  is way up there again.  I actually didn't hear  what you said.  Let's give me my new bit.  The who cares factor.  Sorry, Rich.  Nothing bothers me anymore.  What'd you say?  I don't remember. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, you asked me  who plays here.  Who does?  I don't remember.  No, you do, though.  Colin or something, you said.  I'm asking who works there.  Why is that weird?  Yeah.  I just said it was a good club.  No, I know.  You said some good comics  worked there.  I said who, and you didn't tell me.  I said Andy.  Who?  I heard you.  You know, the thing to do  would be having a really hot girl  on the phone to officially play  Guess What's in My Pants,  a game we haven't played  in a long time  that we attempted to play today.  We'll really do it.  That would be beautiful. 
[03:11:30]  A college student asked McCain  about the Hillary Clinton  drinking video.  I'm sure that you saw  one of your Democratic opponents,  Hillary Clinton,  recently drinking whiskey shots  with some potential voters.  Now, I was wondering  if you think that she's finally  resorted to hitting the sauce  just because of some  unfavorable polling.  And I was also wondering  if you would care to join me  for a shot after this.  I did not see the clip of it,  but I certainly heard about it. 
[03:12:00]  And whatever.  Are we to believe  that John McCain did not see  the clip of Hillary Clinton  doing that shot of whiskey  and sipping at that beer?  Why would he say that?  Like, because if...  I didn't even try to find that clip,  and I probably saw it a hundred times.  It was all over.  Probably a hundred times.  You'd have to be out of touch,  which that kind of...  What does he have to gain  by saying that he didn't see the clip,  but he certainly heard about it?  Is that like being on radio  and saying that you don't know 
[03:12:30]  what show some other show is?  Howard does that a lot.  I mean, we've been kind of  giving him props here and there lately,  but Howard does that a lot.  Makes believe he doesn't hear  any other show.  And other guys,  you're like stupid fucking Maxwell there.  Nat Finney!  Nat Finney!  I don't know those guys!  Maxwell's a monumental nobody's failure.  We gave up on that whole thing  a month ago,  but man, the pests are still obsessed  with fucking with him.  The pests are still at it.  Just giving him a hard time.  I just want to acknowledge 
[03:13:00]  that I do know you guys  are still fucking with him.  And deep down,  not even deep down,  right on the surface,  it makes me feel really good.  Really good.  Because we haven't mentioned  his dumb name in what,  over a month?  But every day,  the pests have a new  fucking little jab at him.  All right, more of them, McCain.  I did not see the clip of it,  but I certainly heard about it.  And whatever makes  Senator Clinton happy is... 
[03:13:30]  John McCain said later  that it was one of the toughest questions  he'd gotten all night.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  That's really tough to answer.  How about how you're going to  maybe polish up things  over there in Iraq?  That's a tough one.  The tough question for McCain  would be,  Mr. McCain,  how would you actually do a shot?  Because those arms  don't really move up too high.  That would be the tough question.  Do a jumping jack. 
[03:14:00]  Get your arms over your head  and make the whirly bird noise.  Pretend you're a helicopter.  Hey, he's a war hero.  Oh, he is.  I have tremendous respect for him.  All right, I just want to make sure  because when we go down this road,  people go, you know,  he suffered.  He wasn't a war hero.  He fucking caved in after five years.  Give me the watch.  Should have been able to last  at least seven, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, of course.  Be damned.  All right.  King of Kong, 
[03:14:30]  Billy Mitchell,  you want to end with this today?  Yes.  Are we obsessed with Billy Mitchell  or what?  I actually do a great Christopher Walken.  Oh, let's hear it.  Do you?  Because Jay does it,  I won't do it.  I used to do it with my act.  Did you?  Yeah.  Because Jay does it,  you won't do it?  I mean, that's his thing.  If Jay does it,  then you know it's not original,  so you can do it anyhow.  Oh, you know,  Jay Moore listens to this program now.  He listens to shit.  My friend.  He listens now.  So he'll know that Rich Voss  just called him a rip-off.  Yeah, why not?  Big deal.  It's going to be worse.  No, he started to call our show again. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, he did?  Yeah, he's realizing that.  What are you talking about?  Jay London?  Jay Moore.  Oh, I was talking about Jay London.  Oh, Jay Moore.  You are such a load of shit, Ross.  Get out of here.  You didn't say last names.  You said Jay.  I didn't know what Jay was talking about.  I said Christopher Walken.  Who did you think we met?  Leno?  I'll do the Walken.  Hey, little man.  Wow.  Wait, let me close my eyes.  I thought, yeah.  I got this watch.  Little man.  Oh, my God.  It's in my ass. 
[03:15:30]  I thought it was in the room.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I'd open my eyes and make sure he wasn't here, Jimmy.  Yep.  I do these impersonations.  That's fucking good, man.  Yeah, do you?  Yeah.  I wish I could find that one.  I do them all day.  Suicide Kings.  You don't even do lines from the movies?  You just mention the movie title?  Thanks for doing Denver.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people. 
[03:16:00]  How about like a, oh?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, that's dice.  Oh.  Why are you doing dice?  Because I do, I was just throwing in a montage of all my impressions.  Oh, dice too.  All right.  Yeah, I do them all.  I don't want to outshine Anthony with impersonations, so I just, I hold back.  All right.  Thank you for that, too.  Can we get Billy Mitchell on the air?  A little more Billy Mitchell for the peeps?  Billy Mitchell?  That tool?  From King of Khan?  Why?  Billy Mitchell.  Play it.  Play the clip.  Whoa.  Could you get, I thought he was in the studio. 
[03:16:30]  It's amazing.  We got some good clips from this guy.  He compares himself to a fighter pilot in World War I.  I mean, this guy's just terrific.  That's a...  You want to explain Billy Mitchell really fast, Dan?  You're really good with a quick explanation.  All right.  Douchebag.  Yes, douchebag.  From King of Khan.  Yeah, he set the record for playing Donkey Kong back in 81, I believe it was.  82, stupid.  Oh, jeez.  Pardon him, wall. 
[03:17:00]  In 82, as I've been corrected.  Very delicately.  82.  NY was different.  Very delicately.  Yeah, Hunter.  He just mentions movie titles.  That's the best impression ever.  It's beautiful.  It's simplicity.  I like how you correct people, too, Jimmy.  It's very, very comforting.  I was in The Shining.  Oh, wow.  That's that guy.  That was the guy that invited Nicholson up. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  And told him about the job.  No, it was Jack.  Of course it was.  The golfer?  I was kidding.  If it's so good.  I'm not going to bash your brains in, Rich, because you don't have them.  Here's dummy.  Oh, little Matt.  I carried this watch in Rich's head because there was nothing in there.  So I put a watch in. 
[03:18:00]  You all right, Rich?  Well, I was just looking at fucking Bush and the Pope.  Yeah.  And?  Yeah.  Pope and the dope.  Look at them.  Wow.  Boo!  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Cuck me.  Nothing but cock me.  Don't try to ask real questions in the middle of your humiliation.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[03:18:30]  Wow.  You know, was you talking to me when you said that?  Was you talking to me?  Oh, wow.  I'm a raging bull.  It's De Niro.  Wow.  It's just like you.  The guy does a De Niro.  It's amazing.  That's right.  Can you believe he's talking to me?  I'm a taxi driver.  Wow.  From Taxi Driver, I think.  Mm-hmm.  All right, let's do...  That's great.  Put the clip on.  Do it.  All right, we're doing Billy Mitchell.  So Billy Mitchell... 
[03:19:00]  He goes back and forth, too.  Held the world record for Donkey Kong.  Set in 1982.  I held the world record for axe killings.  Nicholson.  Of course.  From The Shining.  Yes.  Go on.  It's Cameron Crothers.  Oh, that's all good.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  I was...  And this documentary, King of Kong, is all about that geek culture and this guy, Billy  Mitchell, who's a tool.  A douche.  And a guy named Steve Beebe.  Self-important ass.  Who's not as much of a douche trying to set the world record, taking Billy Mitchell's record 
[03:19:30]  away from him.  Yeah.  Hence the controversy in this film.  The guy's just had this as his shining moment in life, and that was it.  And he can't let it go.  30 years.  Well, here we go.  More Billy Mitchell.  I had somebody draw an analogy for me once that I always remember.  The top French pilot in World War I shot down 24 enemy planes.  A top American pilot.  You don't know his name, do you?  Nobody does. 
[03:20:00]  But it's Eddie Rickenbacker.  Shot down 26 enemy planes.  The German ace, the Red Baron, everyone knows who the Red Baron is.  That's because he shot down 87 enemy planes.  I mean, he was the best.  There's just...  There's a level of difference between people.  And it translates into some games.  Yeah.  That's a great analogy.  Wait, hold on. 
[03:20:30]  I think Jimmy's...  Oh, oh.  One of his great impressions.  Cool.  We're very privileged to have...  Robert De Niro here.  Oh, see?  Wow.  I like how he gets that right out of the way, so there's no questions.  You knocked me out.  Raging Bull, I knocked me out.  Well, let's see.  That's not that good, though.  Let's see what my friend Joe Pesci's doing.  Oh.  There you go.  Play that clip, you prick-stuttering, you.  Play that clip, you motherfucker.  Well, Bob Kelly. 
[03:21:00]  Dude, I broke my knee and my cancer wing fell off in JFK, dude.  I was stuck in Tommy Lee Jones' cock at a party and they had pictures of it.  It was a mystery wrapped in 500 pounds of fat in an enigma.  JFK, Bob.  Just fucking kill yourself.  There's no you at the end of...  All right.  Billy Mitchell's parents speak up now about how great their son is in this next clip. 
[03:21:30]  He's a winner.  Billy Mitchell is absolutely a winner.  It's sort of like being in a maze, but everything you see is actually sauce.  The all-around most seasoned person in the hot sauce chicken wing industry.  Yeah, for sure.  Me.  There's the production end of it.  There's the preparation.  When there's the sales end of it, there's not somebody who encompasses all of those areas like me that I've ever met. 
[03:22:00]  I forgot.  He's great at chicken wings.  Yeah, he's got like a barbecue sauce.  Yeah, he's very great in the chicken wing industry.  He wants to remind people that he's great at that, too.  I will tell you one thing that annoyed me is the fact that he does even have that going.  Like, I was hoping he would have nothing.  Except for the old world record?  Except for an almost 30-year-old record.  For Donkey Kong.  Yeah.  So it depresses you that he actually might have done something with his life? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, that he actually did something.  You were hoping he was still living with his parents in their basement or something.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Working at a deli.  Yep.  Just telling everybody.  Well, he is telling everybody who he is.  It's really kind of sad.  Mm-hmm.  His dad didn't even say my son.  His dad said his name.  Oh, I know.  They're all full of themselves.  It's far more difficult when you're on top, anybody who's on top, to stay on top.  On my phone, it says never surrender.  If somebody beat his record, he'd have a...  Someone's reminding me, best quote from King of Kong, Mitchell says he's more controversial 
[03:23:00]  than the abortion issue.  As he should have been one.  And what does he mean?  He says never surrender.  That's all he did when the new guy came to town.  Yeah.  He's high behind an apron in the fucking kitchen.  Yeah, that's pretty much the theme of the movie, how he avoided Steve Wiebe.  Hold on, I'm just watching Richard Woodward.  Oh, you got that, Clark?  Oh, it's a pope.  Oh, wow.  And I want the sexual stuff to stop because it's so bad for me.  Look at him.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah. 
[03:23:30]  Surrender.  If somebody beat his record, he'd have a plan to beat it back.  I'm sure.  The worst thing that could happen would be to give somebody the credibility of a score  that doesn't deserve it.  But even far worse than that would be to deny somebody the credibility when they deserved it.  What?  If I'm not there, I don't know.  Huh?  Is this over a fucking game? 
[03:24:00]  Donkey Kong.  A game that...  Donkey Kong.  Donkey Kong.  A game maybe 100 people still play.  Yeah.  And he played it the longest, that's it?  You sound like a high score.  Big fucking deal.  That's what we're getting at.  What's the whole bit, Rich?  Even the next...  That's the most sensible thing I've heard Rich ever say.  Right, welcome to the bit.  Even next...  No, but I'm just saying, now I'm getting really fucking...  Really mad.  The next day, they should have said big fucking deal.  I know how your audience feels.  Welcome to the bit.  That's what we're getting at.  How ridiculous this guy...  Oh, okay, I'm just confirming it.  ...and how full of himself he is. 
[03:24:30]  We know!  That's why we're saying it.  Oh!  Wow, you can even do it with food in your mouth, Jimmy.  I like to eat in true romance.  Right, you were in that.  I'm an asshole.  Here's that abortion clip, I believe we found it.  Oh.  No matter what I say, it draws controversy.  It's sort of like the abortion issue.  If you're for it, you're a son of a gun.  If you're against it, you're a son of a gun. 
[03:25:00]  I'm not God.  I don't have all the answers.  So I have to be careful how I share my opinions.  That's true.  You're a son of a gun either way.  But if you played Donkey Kong for hours on end, you're a cunt.  Yeah.  You're not a son of a gun.  You're the son of a douche.  No, if you're against it, you're a son of a gun.  If you're for it, you're a splat in a dumpster a gun.  If you're for it, you're a stewed tomato of a gun. 
[03:25:30]  If you're for it, you're this.  Why are you showing everyone Jimmy's omelet?  It's a visual.  If you're for it, you're a half-eaten omelet of a gun.  Ah, you splat of a gun.  You vacuumed-up innards of a gun. 
[03:26:00]  Bio-waste of a gun.  Oh, you 30 years later still regretting it of a gun.  You, I should have kept him and given him up of a gun.  Oh, I can never stop it.  Ah, yes.  You stuck to a hanger of a gun.  You left hanger abortions on anyway.  You back alley procedure of a gun. 
[03:26:30]  That guy's an asshole.  No kidding.  It's like fucking, it's sort of like the abortion issue.  Oh, what, you talking about your Donkey Kong record?  This guy is so fucking full of himself.  I love him.  I love Billy Mitchell.  This guy's a fool personified.  He really is.  He's a Ricky Gervais character, like Jimmy mentioned earlier.  Here we go.  Billy thinks about who else has done what he's done.  The people who could get, besides myself, that have been seen getting to the end of Donkey Kong. 
[03:27:00]  Gee, now that I think about it, I don't think anybody has.  Hey, gee, now that I think about it.  What about the fucking creator of the game?  You know what letters I use?  USA.  USA.  That's the next clip.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  I thought we should do that.  That's good.  No, that's, wait until you hear him say it.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't mean to ruin it.  God damn me.  Sorry, guys.  I'd love to see this guy in Mexico getting raped by a donkey.  What?  What do you mean?  How they have the donkey shows in Mexico. 
[03:27:30]  A lot of people didn't get it.  I didn't mean I got it.  Colin Quinn, I was just wondering.  Colin Quinn impression.  I'm so embarrassed.  Buffalo wings.  Come on, Gordon.  You gentlemen.  That's a good voice. 
[03:28:00]  Wings, buffalo wings.  This is actually a very good impression of Colin.  All right.  Because he eats a lot, Rich.  You're a little slow today.  I'm just trying to help you out.  I'm not slow.  I've had some great lines today.  You have had some great lines.  Name me 17.  I know my role today.  Just throw some stuff.  You guys are on a roll.  All right. 
[03:28:30]  Here's more Billy Mitchell.  I often have people ask me what my handle is, what my three initials are.  What's the last?  I mean, come on.  I tell people, look at me.  What do you think my three initials were?  If you don't know, you're not looking hard enough.  ATM.  DCH bag.  The guy is such a pompous douche.  He thinks that you just can look at him and go, USA?  A-S-S. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  A-S-S.  G-A-Y.  F-A-G.  You're not looking hard enough.  T-I-E?  No.  Which one was I wearing yesterday?  America.  USA.  USA.  USA.  So I had Latin friends and I had Canadian friends and I always had to keep the Americans  on top.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[03:29:30]  Thanks for that, Bill Mitchell.  We really appreciate you.  You're looking out for all of us.  Right on top there.  You play Donkey Kong with a bunch of nerds.  Thank you.  That's our fucking name, our country.  On the top score, a fucking gorilla rolling barrels down at a little ginzo.  How about you keep America on top by, I don't know, maybe going over to Iraq and fighting  with the boys?  Yeah, doing something.  Right.  Not that I'm doing anything to help the cause, but if you're going to mention that you're  trying to keep USA on top.  He's kept USA on top by holding a record of a game since 1982. 
[03:30:00]  Right.  And not even holding it, just setting it and then not defending it or anything.  He didn't have to defend it.  No one else gave a shit.  They forgot about the game.  They forgot about the game.  No one gave a shit.  They're now trying to beat this record because of the movie.  Just to fuck with him.  Right.  Because he's such an incredible douche.  People are actually going out of their way to buy a Donkey Kong game, put it in their  house, and practice like a motherfucker to beat this guy.  Not to even set the record, but just to beat him.  And all you have to do is videotape it and send it in.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  The funny thing is, he's held the record for 25 years.  The first two people probably went, oh my God.  Wow.  And then 23 years of, who gives a shit?  As they're just hand trucking the Donkey Kong machines out of every fucking bar and arcade  and everything else.  And he's just like, hey, you know, I set the record on that thing.  Oh yeah?  Yeah, great.  As they just throw it in the back of the truck.  Yeah, great buddy.  But can you move out of the way?  I got 10 more of these to collect today.  Yeah.  Go away.  And then some dopey college kid decided he had an idea for a movie and now he have to 
[03:31:00]  deal with Billy Mitchell and his dumb record again and talk about him.  This dumb show.  It's Jimmy Dumb Impressions.  Dumb Impressions.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  My friend Jack Nicholson wouldn't agree.  I'll bash your fucking brains in, Anthony.  Wow.  Where is that from?  I flew over the cuckoo's nest.  Oh, that's right.  I like how he personalizes the impression. 
[03:31:30]  I'm not the only one.  I have other friends like my friend Al Pacino had some thoughts.  Oh, that's your Al.  Does he?  Yeah, Al.  That's Mr. Haney.  Mr. Haney.  I don't know who Mr. Haney is.  He's the guy from Green Acres.  You've got two on the truck you could have.  Well, Mr. Douglas, I brought you your mattress.  I didn't order a mattress, Mr. Haney.  Well, then I'll take it back for a nominal fee. 
[03:32:00]  He was like the Jew of Hootersville or whatever.  Green Acres.  Green Acres.  The Jew of Green Acres.  Always a Jew.  If you wonder why your show isn't going to be picked up on Comedy Central, it's because  you've been Jew smashing.  Someone threw a penny in the glove compartment to get me out of here, Mr. Douglas.  Now, I'm doing bad impressions.  What happened?  Two more Billy Mitchell clips.  Ah.  When you want to put a score up and you want to have a title of world champion, you're competing 
[03:32:30]  against everybody in the world.  You want a title for your own living room?  Man, I'll send you that title.  Your own arcade?  Man, I'll sign it and I'll make up a paper and I'll send you a plaque.  You want your name in the Guinness Book of World Records and then the Twin Galaxies International  Scoreboard?  You have to earn it.  I have to earn it.  There's a lot of scores I've gotten.  And when the time comes and the pressure's that hard, I'll have to do it in a public forum,  as I always have. 
[03:33:00]  There's not a hint of sarcasm.  No.  This is amazing.  Is he a motivational speaker?  I want that plaque he was talking about.  Yeah.  Let's make him send this one.  Yeah, come on, make it.  He said.  Well, I want to see Estelle Getty.  She's on television.  Oh, wait.  Oh, no.  That's not Estelle Getty.  Sorry.  Well, nice to see she healed after being punched by that black guy in the hallway with  the walker.  And she got her hat back, too.  She got her new hat.  That is exactly.  That's that big white hair that went flying in that cliff. 
[03:33:30]  Where's the cliff?  Show us that fucking cliff.  God damn it.  Hold on.  I don't want to be a party pooper, but we have to be at the other place by 11 o'clock.  I know.  That's why.  We've got a huge meeting over there.  That's why we did 45 minutes of bonus show yesterday.  Even longer, I think.  Billy Mitchell checking in.  So don't fucking give a shit.  Have you seen this?  Billy Mitchell checking in.  He writes, check the Twin Galaxies website.  I beat the high score again.  I really want to talk to the real Billy Mitchell. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Show the video.  I got to see it just once.  Got to see it.  Just once.  Just once.  But you guys can never see it once.  I watched the light as she's falling.  But you can never see it once.  I want to see her fall now.  No, you can't.  Here's the funny part.  As she's falling, you can almost hear her go, whoo-hoo-hoo.  You can't just see it once.  That's the problem.  She whoopsies.  Play it, Dan, before I fucking come over there and cut you.  Where is it?  Oh, you can't put it there?  It's above your head, Jimmy. 
[03:34:30]  I want to see it over there.  I can't watch it above my head.  Watch it there.  Oh, here we go.  Okay.  Now start it from the beginning.  Now guys, just once today.  Start it from the beginning.  Just once.  It looks like the Pope.  It's the Pope.  Give him one play.  All right.  Look at this.  One play.  Watch the hair go poof.  The old hag.  Watch her hair.  We love the way the hair poofs.  This is the video of the 101-year-old woman getting punched in the face of the black guy.  A couple of pops.  She's attending a hat removal seminar. 
[03:35:00]  He's not kissing the ring.  He's taking it.  There she goes.  Watch.  Watch the way.  Watch just how clumsy she is when she falls.  She can't.  She has hair like Taylor Hicks.  It's just not right, man.  Oh, one more time.  No, you said one.  You said one.  You said one.  You said one.  Now I know what to look for.  Now I know what to look for.  One more.  Now I know what to look for.  One more.  One more.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  One more.  Are we in agreement?  One more.  Yeah.  All right.  One more.  She gets all wobbly and tips over.  Down goes old lady.  One more.  That's it, though.  It's like watching Frasier get knocked down.  I love it.  Just one more.  This whole broad goes down, doesn't she?  Oh, she fucking...  I hear me.  The hat removal ceremony has begun.  Look how wobbly she gets when she falls.  Oh, it's classic. 
[03:36:00]  He's assaulting Phil Donahue.  Let's look at the puff of hair and the fall.  Here it comes.  You guys are not right.  You guys are not right.  All right.  Let me...  Look at the wheel.  You're not right.  You're not right.  Funniest internet clip ever, ever.  Oh, shit. 
[03:36:30]  It's the way the body goes down.  It's so...  Oh, it's so wrong.  She turns sideways.  Her arm goes out, but you know, it can't support her.  Oh, does she go down?  We have to leave, unfortunately.  All right.  The last Billy Mitchell clip.  Video games are meant to be played in a competitive environment, under pressure, organized, where you have to perform literally on demand.  Have you ever seen your husband compete head-to-head in video games? 
[03:37:00]  Never.  Never.  My stomach hurts.  Oh, I know.  I can't watch that without just...  I would hate to watch that with, like, fucking executives in the room.  I would have to blurt out something about hat removal.  Because she didn't mind her manners and remove her hat when she was in the room.  I like how Jimmy put it as the hat removal ceremony.  It has begun.  It's a whole ceremony that ends with her clumsily falling to the floor as her walker wheel spins. 
[03:37:30]  It's a sign of respect for the elderly when you remove their hat quickly with a fist.  You should have put it on tighter.  Everyone's asking where we can find the video.  What's the search on that, man?  I don't know until I see it again.  Old lady mugged.  Old lady mugged on YouTube?  That fucking walker wheel is like James Caan's tire in Misery when he goes off the road.  It's just...  After tragedy, the wheel is just kind of still spinning. 
[03:38:00]  The wheel thinks it's supposed to keep going.  Right.  It doesn't expect its owner to be fucking collapsed by a fist on the little end.  Laid out by a giant mitt.  Well, it's so funny watching Gary Busey get fucking knocked down.  I love it.  Just watch it.  Tim C. from Cleveland.  I think it's hilarious that you guys find that clip funny, but when it first happened,  he wanted to have a race war.  Yeah, they changed their whole take on things.  That hair tufting going...  It gets me every time.  Line of the day brought to you by AshleyMadison.com. 
[03:38:30]  If you're looking for a little something on the side and don't want to get caught, do  yourself a favor and check out AshleyMadison.com.  You like this website, Rich?  Yeah.  What's wrong, Rich?  You're not laughing along with the guys today.  You all right?  I'm...  I was fucking laughing.  What's wrong?  I'm offended by that video.  Why?  Because that happened to my grandmother.  It did not.  Yeah.  They broke in the house and tied her up and kicked my dog.  She should have had a gun.  Dummy.  They kicked what?  They tied her up to the chair, smacked her around. 
[03:39:00]  Uh-huh.  And then what happened?  I came.  That didn't happen to your grandmother.  Yes, it did.  What happened?  I just told you, fucking dummy.  No, we didn't hear the last part.  Tied her up what?  Tied her up and then what?  Went, smacked her around and robbed the fucking house.  Oh, Rob.  Nah-uh-uh.  I want the rent.  Did she have a hat on?  Knocked her teeth out.  False teeth.  No, I didn't.  Teeth removal ceremony.  False teeth, yeah.  Knocked her false teeth out of her head.  How does the mugger not just start laughing when that happens? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, that's not that big.  That's not that big of a deal, Laura.  Come home and see your grandmother tattooed show with no teeth in her mouth.  Yeah, but false teeth falling out.  That's whatever.  That's true.  You could glue them right back on.  They punched her teeth out, and then what happened?  What happened?  They just kept chopping.  That's what Dan said.  Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.  That's all right.  He wasn't on mic.  It's your joke, man.  Why are you giving me the evil look?  I thought we were talking.  I was going to answer what happened.  They robbed her, and they left the house and kicked my little dog.  They kicked your dog? 
[03:40:00]  Frisky.  They kicked Frisky.  Did they kill it?  They kicked Frisky.  Did they really?  How did they not?  Did they kill it?  Huh?  Did they kill it?  No, but they kicked it very hard.  I hope he still holds that record.  They gave Frisky a boot.  Good Frisky.  What kind of dog was Frisky?  Huh?  What kind of dog, besides not a protective one?  Let me think.  A Jewish grandmother.  It was a fucking poodle.  No, it wasn't a fucking poodle.  No, sorry.  It was half a...  I don't know.  It just had a...  A judo?  It was a boot-dented dog. 
[03:40:30]  It was awful.  A judo?  It was a Jewish poodle.  Now we got it.  Yes, of course.  Thanks for explaining it.  Now it's funny.  I had to actually work it through my own head.  A judo?  Oh, because my black neighbor had one.  He had a noodle.  I had one.  It was a droodle.  Why? 
[03:41:00]  Right?  Why?  You should have one.  Hi, fly boy.  He collected a field.  Here's that joke.  Going back, it may be playable.  Yeah.  Can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Yeah, raw.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  Oh.  I thought, sure, he was unable to reach it.  Yeah.  Yeah, that happens, though.  Listen, line of the day.  We got to go.  We really do have a big meeting.  Cock meat.  Nothing but cock.  What?  We were supposed to be out of here 10 minutes ago.  I know.  What the fuck?  So technically, we're doing bonus show right now.  This is bonus show right now, people.  They don't really understand, but it really is, because we were supposed to leave at 1040 
[03:41:30]  today.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  You're not allowed to say gypsy.  They call themselves travelers.  Travelers.  Travelers.  Hey, this is actually right.  There is a very high who cares factor with your comment, but you are true.  I die with the top of my lips.  I never take it off.  Right to the next runner-up line of the day.  I'm afraid of being poisoned, obviously.  Oh, is that it, too?  I'm sure it is, yeah.  Hey, have some of this, huh? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Hey there, father.  Some guy with a hummus cart.  That was a very good line, Jimmy.  Jimmy's going to be at Caroline starting tomorrow night, and he's going to be on Good Morning  America on Friday.  No, tomorrow.  When?  Tomorrow sometime.  Good Morning America tomorrow?  Yeah, like 945.  It's like 30 hours.  945, little Jimmy North.  Are you going to be doing any of your impressions on Good Morning America tomorrow?  Yeah, I'm going to point out, I'm going to make them watch that video and show Diane  Sawyer her hair looks like the old lady's. 
[03:42:30]  How it puts out.  You know what version's on YouTube?  YouTube, it's you guys making fun of the video, is the audio.  No, it's not.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  What did I just say?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Is it really?  Yeah.  You got to watch it.  It's on YouTube.  Under what again?  I don't know.  With the commentary, I don't know.  It's just old lady mugged if you want to see the video.  Oh, wow.  Really?  There's a version where there's the commentary.  Oh, nice.  Okay.  Over and over again.  The video was just being played.  Really?  Yes.  Play-by-play of the hat removal ceremony. 
[03:43:00]  Commence with the hat removal ceremony.  Ba-ba-ba-ba!  Pomp and circumstance.  And then a big animal comes in and just bashes her head.  Fucking Kong just got her.  Fucking hat off her entitled head.  Throwing barrels down at her.  He's got the world record.  Bitch, take off your hat indoors. 
[03:43:30]  Another runner-up line of the day.  Are you going to fly me over to New York?  Listen.  I'm pretty hot.  I'd like to fly you to L.A. on Oceanic Flight 8.  Fucking what's the flight number?  Flight 815.  Fuck.  Couldn't remember the flight number.  Still good, though.  That's great, dude.  Jesus.  One more runner-up.  Go.  It's like, don't you love being scared?  It's fucking fun.  Like, her favorite thing is that I scare the shit out of her all the time.

They're going to give you this shitty fucking public person story.  No, I'm getting a personal fucking tour of the White House.  From the White House.  Who do you know in the Secret Service?  Excuse me.  I can back up his story, because when Rich and I were hanging in Arizona, which is a different  story from the one when we hung out in South Beach, Miami, we hung out with Secret  Service.  Okay, buddy.  Yeah, a friend of mine used to be...  One of the guys used to be a Pennsylvania or a Philly cop, I believe. 
[03:45:00]  And then he moved right up to Secret Service.  And they're huge fans of the show.  There are guys that actually...  Yeah.  Actually, what's the word?  Protect the President?  Guard the President.  Guard the President that are fans of this radio show.  And they listen to the little earphones.  Yes!  When they're supposed to be listening to...  Well, that's funny.  The guy I was talking to yesterday was listening to his program.  Was it the same guy?  No, it's the Noam.  He listens to his program all the time.  We couldn't believe it, because we were walking by, and didn't he recognize you or something?  I hate to...  Yeah, a lot of people do.  And you asked me his name. 
[03:45:30]  Why would I give you his fucking name?  He's Secret Service, you dummy.  He's a secret.  Ah, remove your hat in YouTube, I believe.  It's called Remove Your Hat.  Yes.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I'll give you the biggest thing I've had in my ass in order of size.

That's the video right there.  Remove Your Hat.  Check it out on YouTube.  Remove Your Hat.  How long is the video?  Like, that's what the whole thing was about.  We took this...  It was just an aside that happened to this poor old woman.  Her hat falls off, and we call it Remove Your Hat. 
[03:46:30]  Wait, what's the commentary?  It's 12 and a half minutes.  I know, hold on.  12 and a half minutes, I'm just...  We're gonna, uh...  Just for a second, we gotta hear some of it.  You sure?  Her fucking Frank Vincent wig.  Look at that.  Oh, there it goes.  This tape is called...  This tape is called Rich Vos trying to get paid a governor.  Right, right, right.  It reasons it's...  We 100% sure this is real.  This isn't...  Oh, it's a little real.  The guy got arrested and he's everything.
