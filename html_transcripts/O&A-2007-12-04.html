<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion contrasting the perceived expectation of "nice" radio with their own shock jock approach.  This segued into a conversation about the frigid studio temperature and their building's heating system, sparking anecdotes about personal temperature preferences, including Anthony’s lavish Christmas decorations in his Jewish neighborhood, and further tangents about Nazi action figures and lawn jockeys.  The show then shifted to a news story about a woman impaled in the eye by a coat hook, prompting a cascade of increasingly graphic injury and survival stories from the hosts and callers.  Listener calls included accounts of a snake bite to the eye, a pink Detroit Lions jersey for breast cancer patients, and a near-fight over a stolen hat.

A segment followed focusing on a woman found dead in her apartment after two years, discussed with dark humor.  This transitioned to “Pinky the Cat,” a YouTube video of a cat attacking a sheriff, juxtaposed with a news story about a boy killing a kitten with a hammer.  The segment concluded with Steven Lynch's "Kill a Kitten," discussion of Jimmy’s New Year’s Eve show, and a clip of a financial analyst's on-air breakdown, as well as a story regarding Artie Lange's nightclub altercation.

The next segment opened with discussion of an unseen individual’s panic attack, then moved to Randy Taylor ("the Jimmy Dean guy") and circulating audio of him. They recounted their appearance on Don Imus’s post-firing return show, describing themselves as “loose cannons” and Imus as nervous.  They mentioned Imus's guest "Bo Deedle" making a gun gesture towards them.  Levon Helm’s music was also briefly discussed.  The hosts launched into a harsh critique of Linda Stasi, a New York Post writer, for her alleged bias regarding Imus's return and perceived hypocrisy in her reviews of Imus’s apology and Dave Chappelle’s comedy. They expressed intense dislike and even wished her harm.  Further audio from their Imus appearance was mentioned, with the hosts defending their support of him.  The conversation shifted to poorly designed movie covers, including *Cops and Roberson* and *I Love Trouble*.  A caller inquired about scheduled guests, leading to a discussion of Anthony's high health insurance bill.  Comedians Jeff Ross and Bob Saget were confirmed as guests. The segment largely focused on Jeff Ross's anger at his perceived lack of airtime the previous day due to a long Ken Burns interview, culminating in a discussion about show logistics and guest handling, ending with promises to give Ross more airtime and a continuation of "Guess the Sound."

Bob Saget and Jeff Ross joined the show, promoting Saget’s Broadway play *The Drowsy Chaperone*. Saget discussed theater versus television, sharing anecdotes and jokes, as did Ross, including a story about Steve-O at a Gene Simmons roast.  The hosts discussed Ross and Saget’s shared agent, Heidi Feigen, and their rider requests.  A substantial portion involved the viewing and explicit discussion of an Amy Fisher sex tape, with detailed descriptions and quotes from the tape.  The hosts, guests, and callers discussed pornography, celebrity culture, TMZ, the Olsen twins, and Liza Minnelli’s appearance.  A brief mention was made of a call from Joe Francis (Girls Gone Wild), in jail, discussing allegations of abuse.  The segment concluded with promotion of Saget’s show and Ross’s appearances, interspersed with further commentary on Liza Minnelli.


Joe Francis, creator of Girls Gone Wild, was a guest, detailing his legal battles in Panama City, Florida, claiming fabricated charges and a corrupt judicial system. He described 71 initial felony charges (reduced to four), totaling 335 years in prison, following a federal lawsuit victory against the city.  These charges, he claimed, were manufactured after the win and involved false accusations of cocaine on his plane and later contraband (prescription medication) in jail, resulting in eight months without bail.  His lawyer, Dave Houston, corroborated this, adding details of alleged prosecutorial misconduct, including the distribution of what he claimed was child pornography.  Francis described alleged abuse in jail. He mentioned the website meetjoefrancis.com for support and investigation.  The discussion touched on the age of participants in Girls Gone Wild videos, with Francis insisting on legal age and consent.  The conversation shifted to the brand's success and the controversy's impact on sales. The hosts reviewed the Amy Fisher pornographic video, interspersing sexually explicit language and jokes. Patrice O’Neal promoted a comedy show, and Ross and Saget promoted their appearances.  The hosts also advertised an upcoming appearance by adult film stars. Sexually explicit jokes and vulgar language were frequent.

A segment focused on a graphic, sexually explicit viewing and commentary on the Amy Fisher sex tape, with highly offensive and vulgar language describing the sexual acts.  Crude jokes and detailed descriptions of bodies and sexual performance were prevalent.  The hosts frequently fast-forwarded, highlighting moments and using the recurring gags of “money shots” and “dribbles,” with one position compared to “skydiving into her pussy.”  They watched "Two Girls, One Cup," showing the reactions of Bob Saget and Jeff Ross (Saget expressing extreme disgust) and Lily from the Ron and Fez show (reacting with revulsion).  Jim Norton’s purported Broadway audition tape was also played.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Let's go! 
[00:00:30]  Screw!  Radio bad boys.  Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities.  Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs.  Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot jobs.  Opie and Anthony.  Testing one, two, one, two.  Po, Po, Bo Bo, Banana, Nana.  Banana, Fanna.  Fo-Fo.  Fi-fi, Mo Mo.  Poe! 
[00:01:00]  This is the worst, the worst show I've, this is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, good Lord.  Okay, terrific.  Boo!  This is great iced tea. 
[00:02:00]  Where'd you get that, out of the hamper?  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  That's the place to be.  Of course it is.  Right here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, this is the place to be.  Very good, Anthony.  Yes.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Wake up!  I know, we're all in our winter coats in here. 
[00:02:30]  Because for some reason, they don't turn the heat on in the morning until a certain hour, I guess.  This building's all automated.  Yeah, they don't think much of shock jocks because the heat goes on at 7.  Yeah.  That doesn't really help us out now, does it?  No, not for the first hour.  If you're watching us on Pal Talk, we're in winter coats trying to do a radio show.  That makes sense.  You know, they just, these buildings are like, they're alive.  They're all programmed and you can't just walk up to a thermostat on the wall and hit something and have heat come out anymore. 
[00:03:00]  It just doesn't work like that.  The building, like, is set up where it knows when the heat is supposed to come on.  So we sit here with our coats on.  And wait for that to happen, which will be about 7 o'clock.  Yeah, so we'll just bundle up.  Bundle up till then.  You know, I haven't even had to turn on the heat yet in my house.  What about you, Jimmy? 
[00:03:30]  What?  I have not had to turn the heat on in my house.  Now, there are people listening to us in warm climates right now, but we're in New York and we're, you know.  It's windy and cold.  We're in the beginning stages of winter here and I still haven't had to turn the heat on.  Matter of fact, I still have the windows open in my apartment.  No, you don't.  I swear to God.  Why?  And I still, my bedroom, windows open, blankets pretty much off.  Sleeping with a sheet.  Okay, what's, how is that possible? 
[00:04:00]  It's what happens in New York if you live in New York, if you live up high in New York.  Why?  It's still cold up there.  I'm getting everyone's heat rising, I guess.  Oh, you're saying like the heat from the whole building.  I guess.  It's rising up.  I don't know what the deal is.  I'm not trying to save money or anything.  I just don't need to turn the heat on yet, which is so bizarre to me.  I hate the heat.  I hate it.  I like air conditioning all year when I sleep.  I can't sleep.  But my building is set up where I can't make it that cool because once the building switches  over to kind of... 
[00:04:30]  Oh, I hate when they're in control.  I hate that.  I hate it.  How it used to be.  I turn on the cool like all the way and then it just kind of blows like average chill air.  Not even cold, like lukewarm air.  It's so irritating.  I like it being like a refrigerator in the bedroom.  Bedroom's the only place I like it to be cool in the winter because you go to sleep,  there's nothing worse than pulling those covers and being all sweaty and sticky.  But the rest of the house, I like heat.  I want heat. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Well, there you have it.  And I started to utilize my lovely fireplace.  Ooh.  That's right.  I go on Pal Talk at night, you know, sometimes and pop it on and in the background's a crackling  fire.  Exactly.  It's wonderful.  I just sit there sipping a glass of wine, perhaps, with a nice crackling fire in the  background with Steve from Bayshore making Nazi jokes about what the fire's used for. 
[00:05:30]  Horrible human being that he is.  We were showing each other our Nazi action figures last night on Pelt.  It's actually Nazi action figures?  Yes.  He has some kind of German soldier and I have the Fuhrer himself.  What are they doing?  Running away from the Ehrenberg trial?  I'll be hung.  Yeah.  You know, you got to play with your action figure.  Where do you get Nazi action figures?  I don't know.  Somebody gave it to me.  And on the box, it said, you know, this is not glorifying what was done. 
[00:06:00]  There's a whole disclaimer on the box.  Oh, okay.  But yet, you take him out and he's got his little swastika armband and his little hat.  And then I was pulling his pants down and showing Hitler's butt on the camera.  I was undressing Hitler.  Does it look like Hitler?  Because a lot of these action figures...  Oh, it looks like really just like him.  A lot of action figures don't look like the person.  Oh, no.  This one looks...  It's the spitting image.  Really? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, people get a kick out of that.  And my little lawn jockey...  Well, that wasn't me.  Keith decided when I was away one year to put one on my front lawn and leave it sit there while I was on vacation.  So when I came back, I look and there's a lawn jockey on my lawn.  Much to my neighbor's chagrin, I'm sure.  Do they still sell those?  I guess they do.  Yeah.  I guess they do because I had one.  You do realize you live in a Jewish neighborhood, right? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Very liberal neighborhood also.  So things like lawn jockeys, I don't think they're tolerated very well.  But Keith, oh, there's a load of laughs.  And you don't talk to your neighbor anymore?  Well, I haven't seen him in a while.  He tried, though.  He was coming to your front door with some desserts.  What am I going to say?  He made the effort.  His family made the effort.  I'm just a douche.  When it comes to making friends in the neighborhood and stuff, I don't know when I'm going to be home. 
[00:07:30]  When I am, I'm going to lock myself in my house.  I'm almost sitting at the computer just doing something.  I don't have time for a, hey, how you doing kind of a thing.  I'm terrible like that.  It's my fault.  Are you getting your Christmas lights and your huge Christmas wreath this year?  Yes, I do believe in, what's the date?  Let's make this perfectly clear.  Anthony lives in a Jewish neighborhood.  He's the only non-Jew. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Safe to say, right?  Safe to say.  And not only does he display his Christmas lights, he also displays a, what, was it 10, 12 feet across a wreath?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a giant.  I have a company that actually comes over and has to decorate the house because they need a cherry picker.  They need one of those machines to get things up high and put lights and stuff, and then they decorate the trees and everything.  It's very festive.  It looks very Christmassy.  But I'm the only lights on the block. 
[00:08:30]  Pretty much the rest is just menorahs in the window.  I know why that makes me laugh.  It seems like yesterday that I drove up to your house and saw your car on blocks.  Yeah.  In the weeds.  Yeah, that was back before radio.  Before we were heading to Boston to start this radio thing, and that seems like yesterday to me.  And now, fast forward a few years, and you got a cherry picker putting up a 10-foot wreath. 
[00:09:00]  Putting up a giant wreath.  On your house in a Jewish neighborhood.  Not only that, but then, like, my house has columns on the outside by the front door.  How tall are the columns?  Big columns.  They got to be 30 feet high, maybe.  Something like that.  25 feet high.  And they get wrapped with the green, like, you know, what would you call that?  Garland, I guess.  Yeah, I guess garland.  And then on top, there's huge red bows. 
[00:09:30]  That's what it looks like.  Big candy canes.  You should make them into candy canes.  Yeah.  Looks like big candy canes.  And then there's lights, and my trees get lights on them.  How long do they stay up for?  They stay up until a little after New Year's, I guess.  That's it?  You seem like the type of guy that would, bah, February, March, really.  I don't do it.  The company comes and takes it down.  They store it for you.  And then next year, they take it out, and they put them back up again.  Because I'm not Mr. Get-on-a-ladder guy and start tacking lights up anymore. 
[00:10:00]  I've done all this.  Everything.  Let me assure you.  Everything I hire people to do these days, I've done a thousand times myself in the past,  and I've grown to hate it.  You decided never again.  Never again.  I, you know, if I have a problem with the air conditioning unit in the attic or anything,  or something as simple as changing filters.  But that's a quick fix for you.  I ain't doing it.  You were in the business for so long.  That would be like a ten-minute job.  Dude, and I was in the business too long. 
[00:10:30]  And I don't want to do it anymore.  That's just what it is.  As far as that stuff goes, I'm not down to earth.  Like everybody, hey, you know, you go out to a bar, Ant's hanging out, we're drinking beers.  It was pretty cool, you know.  He'll buy the beers.  He'll hang out, talk about stuff, whatever.  But when it comes to doing things that I did a thousand times and didn't like them, I am not down to earth. 
[00:11:00]  I'm an elitist snob when it comes to doing things that I don't enjoy doing.  One of which is any type of work that need be done on a house or a car.  I've done it too many times, and I've had it.  That's it.  I'm a snob.  There you have it.  Fancy.  No, not fancy, man.  Just sick and tired of doing things like that.  Man.  Yeah, man.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:11:30]  Taking a lot more phone calls these days, so if you have something to add to the program, give us a call.  877-212-ON-A.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  The Staten Island woman survives freak coat hook impaling.  Oh, yeah, we got that.  We were watching this on the news this morning, and it just makes your eye hurt.  Your eye will hurt when you hear the story.  I had to rub my eye because I couldn't imagine the pain that this would. 
[00:12:00]  The pain's got to be incredible.  Well, here's the story just to get everyone on board.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  A woman survives a freak accident after a hanger hook plunges into her eye.  Now she's thanking rescuers who saved her sight and her life.  It was three weeks ago.  Geraldine Ribeiro slipped and fell into a door.  A coat hanger hook punctured her eye, penetrating deep into her head.  The doctor and firefighters who removed the hook had to saw off a section of the base while Ribeiro was awake, 
[00:12:30]  and she didn't have any pain medication.  You said, pumpkin, if you just stay awake with me, if you just let me get this thing off your face,  then I promise you we'll be able to give you anesthesia, and I remember him coming at me with that drill.  The hook was completely removed.  Ribeiro is expected to make a full recovery.  It's amazing how your body is, like, how many things can kill you and then how many things you can survive. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  A hook.  How do you get a hook in your eye and then still have your sight?  It had to have slipped into the socket, like, on the side of the eye.  I think if it went right through her eye, she wasn't seeing crap anymore.  And the front of your face, there's a lot of room.  You can get a lot of things in there.  In there, in the front of your face, and you're going to survive.  It's not going to be pleasant.  I thought at first it was, like, a wire hanger or something like that,  but it's one of those, like, a coat hanger that you screw to a door. 
[00:13:30]  Sure.  And, you know, you hang your coat on it.  And she slipped and fell into the door.  Her eye smacked right on the hook part and just went right in there.  And then...  Was it behind her eye, you think?  Yeah, it probably hooked in behind her eye.  And she couldn't have anesthesia while they were taking it out for some reason.  I don't know, Dr. Mengele decided he was going to try a little experiment.  And then they had to cut it before they could take it out. 
[00:14:00]  So she said she saw him coming toward her with some kind of drill apparatus or whatever it was.  Was she still standing?  Like, did she fall into the coat rack and then go, uh...  And then they had to open the door with her attached to the door?  Probably.  No.  Probably had to remove the door.  Oh, is that horrid?  But you know what I mean?  How did they get her off?  Did she have to just stand there and go, there's a problem?  Yeah.  The whole bathroom stinks because she just used it?  Let's see.  Oh, an eye injury story?  Okay.  I was just going to go into, uh...  Because, like you said, there are things that people can survive and it's just horrific. 
[00:14:30]  There was a guy that was trying to climb...  I think it was a kid.  Trying to climb a fence.  A wrought iron fence with those spikes on top.  I love the fence stories.  Slipped.  I think this was Boston.  Yeah.  Slipped.  It went through his...  The bottom of his jaw.  Uh...  You know, the soft part under between, like, your jawbone.  Threw that up out his mouth and was sticking out of his mouth. 
[00:15:00]  So he's hanging by his jaw.  And they had to saw that off and take him to the hospital.  Thank God for the saw.  Like, you imagine if that happened, like, with the electric...  In Roman times?  What would they do?  They'd just, uh...  Hack your jaw off with a battle axe.  They would just, like, probably tickle your face with parsley.  There's nothing they could do.  Right.  Why would you do that?  Because there's nothing else to do.  There's nothing else you can do.  They would just saw your jaw off. 
[00:15:30]  Does someone have some parsley?  No, then how would they get the...  Because there's no electricity back then.  How would they get the fence?  Because I think you need an electric saw to cut through a wrought iron fence.  Yeah, it would take a while without a hand saw.  They were always, like, you know, chopping wood.  So they would chop your jaw off.  They'd probably hack your jaw off.  And they would give you a handful of leeches and send you home.  And then you'd be the guy that roams around town with half a jaw.  Right.  In pain.  Yes, I remember him.  Let's go to this.  Chew this root of hickory. 
[00:16:00]  What?  This root of hickory.  There's nothing for you?  Of course not.  I'm in pain.  Can I have a little hickory root?  See the alchemist.  I used to go to a dentist.  He would give me all that natural stuff.  I'm like, how about...  Get out of here.  How about the stuff that works?  Your rugs.  I wish I knew the names, but it was like, I would have to go to one of those herbal pharmacies  and I was, like, getting, like, plants in a pill thing.  I'm like, this isn't going to work.  Plants.  Let's say hi to Space Trucker. 
[00:16:30]  What's up, Space Trucker?  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Space Trucker.  It's about time someone acknowledges Jimmy's birthday.  It's very hurtful.  I forgot that it was not your birthday.  All right.  What's up, Space Trucker?  I just wanted to linger longer there.  No, years back, I was in rural Georgia, down south.  It's about four in the morning.  I'm eating breakfast in a basically empty Waffle House.  And my waitress had this big bandage over one eye.  So she brings me my food, and I'm starting to cut stuff up, and I'm going to chit-chat. 
[00:17:00]  I said, oh, you got an infection in your eye?  And she says, no, snake bite.  She got bit in the eye by a snake?  Snake bite.  I was speechless.  I don't want to say to that.  Not much.  That's one of my fears right there, getting bit by a snake.  Yeah, well, I don't hear you. 
[00:17:30]  I don't think that much.  But, you know, you do a little hiking in L.A.  We did the hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and back up.  And we're on the lookout for the rattlers.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's one of my fears right there.  Let's say hi to Joe in Brooklyn.  Joe, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thanks, Joe.  I just got to say, no more wire hangers for that bitch.  No wire hangers ever.  Ever!  That's a terrible thing.  Yeah, I don't think anyone's going to beat that story today. 
[00:18:00]  We're hurt in a lot of cities.  We'll see.  Maybe another city has a better story than that.  Chris, Connecticut, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  How are you?  Yeah.  Oh, I just find it very amusing that last week you were wincing over pulling a hook out  of a fish's mouth.  It's too early for that linger longer.  Makes me laugh, though.  Hey, which 80s New Wave Tuesday?  Number 10 we haven't played?  All right.  You're in ancient Rome, and maybe a horse has done something like chew your crotch, and 
[00:18:30]  they don't know what to do for you, so they rub a mint leaf on it.  They didn't know what to do.  They had no idea.  I had a full paw at the bank the other day.  Yeah?  Some guy walked in, and he was wearing a surgical mask, and I had no clue why, but it was one  of those things wearing a bank, somebody wearing a mask.  It was kind of like that.  Yeah, you don't want to see that.  Yeah.  You don't want to see anyone with a mask in a bank. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, so I kind of made a joke.  I was like, making a withdrawal, are you?  You know, like a bank robbery joke.  Sure.  And then the guy turns around with the mask on, and I noticed he's also got his hand  bandaged up.  He goes, no, I had stem cell implants, and they seem to be taking, but my immune system  is really weak.  So I'm like, oh my God. 
[00:19:30]  I wouldn't have said a word if I knew I was going to get this speech on how this guy's  almost dead.  You thought he was like...  I thought he was actually coming in maybe to do some work, and it was a dusty atmosphere  where he was going to be working or something.  Well, maybe he just didn't want to get the flu.  You see those people walking all over the joint these days.  Yeah, he doesn't want SARS.  Was it really that?  I had stem cells implanted, and they seem to be taking, but my immune system is very weak, 
[00:20:00]  so I have to wear the mask so as not to get infected.  Can you please step away?  Yeah.  This is very dangerous for me.  Don't breathe on me or look at me.  Sorry about that, dude.  Oh no, you just touched me.  That could be a big problem.  I'd be dead in 20 minutes.  I knew I should have taken a chance and left my house. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, we could play, you know, embarrassing story time.  I wanted no part of that.  I told one a thousand times about the big seatbelt thing when I got in the passenger seat and  had a buck on my seatbelt, and it was huge.  I said, who's the slob that was sitting here?  And the guy goes, oh, my mother's a little overweight.  It was out to the end.  It was the end of the seatbelt.  You're too nice.  When the guy started the story, like, let's just say, I'll be Anthony and you be the guy.  All right.  So, you're making a withdrawal? 
[00:21:00]  No, actually, I had some stuff.  You're boring me.  You should have walked away from him.  Yeah, I should have walked away in mid-explanation.  What's he going to do?  Chase me?  Doubt it.  Oh, sir.  You should have chewed on the bark of an elm.  That would have helped you.  Hey, let's go to Long Island.  You need some Piccadilly, Root.  Let's go to Long Island.  A hotbed of Opie and Anthony activity.  What's up, Chris?  I was down in Aruba two weeks ago, and some woman was walking by one of the pools with 
[00:21:30]  a Detroit Lions jersey, but it was pink.  So, I made some comment, like, oh, would you throw it in the wash with the bleach by mistake?  And he goes, no, you have to have breast cancer to get one of these.  Oh, boy.  What a buzzkill.  That's a bad one.  Now, you got to do it this way now.  No, I got it because I have breast cancer.  Breast cancer.  What's wrong with you?  Do you have any heart? 
[00:22:00]  With a Lions jersey?  Yeah.  I mean, how would he know that?  Yeah.  I hate the pink jerseys in sports, and it's not all for breast cancer.  It's just the girly thing to do.  And I blame Boston.  I think Boston started with the pink Red Sox hats, and now every...  I think so.  Now every team has to have the pink version of their jersey or their hat.  Yep.  I hate that.  For the girls.  The best is, I think it was here in New York, some of the Yankee logos were, like, 
[00:22:30]  gang symbols or something.  You read that story, huh?  Oh, yeah.  They were selling Yankee hats in Bloods and Crips color.  And if you bought one of these not knowing, you're going to put yourself in a lot of danger.  You walk into the store like, hey, you're just thinking, hey, that will look cool.  Yeah, it looks cool.  You know what it was?  It was blue or red, but it had the bandana kind of pattern on it.  Yeah.  So it was absolutely made for gang members.  And if you're wearing that and you don't know where you're walking, you'd just be dead. 
[00:23:00]  And you know what?  I have no problem with that.  Just let us know that that's a hat maybe I shouldn't be picking out.  Yeah.  That's all.  That's all I want.  Exactly.  From the store.  You or I wearing that hat, Crips and Bloods are not going to think that you and I are the  Crips or the Bloods.  No.  I don't think they would bother us.  They'd probably go, look at that idiot hat.  No.  They wouldn't give us a beat down or nothing.  No.  Of course not.  They know you're not in the gang.  Our phone number, 877-212. 
[00:23:30]  How about we take that chance?  How about you?  Oh, boy.  Just shimmy up in some colors.  And we send you uptown a little bit.  If you dressed in all blue and then walked into a Bloods neighborhood being purposefully  mockful.  Right.  But if you obviously just had a blue hat on that you bought you some dumb tourist with  your fanny pack.  I bet they would knock it off your head.  Maybe.  Or to take it off.  And then you'd have to grab it back real quick and then say, if you wanted to see my  hat, you could have asked.  Oh, God.  In high school would he snatch my tango off? 
[00:24:00]  He took a piece of my scalp, too.  You've never seen a hat grabbed off a head.  But, boy, I was like, I grabbed it back.  He's like, oh, you want to fight me?  And all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, boy, you're in this.  Oh, no.  I'm real close to a fight.  No, to a beating.  We're walking to the fight area.  And that's when I said, if you want to see my hat, why didn't you ask?  Oh, no.  His hat-borrowing etiquette needed a little bit.  He should have just tapped me and requested it.  He should go, take it for a test drive. 
[00:24:30]  You were walking to the beating?  Yeah.  And something happened.  And what happened in between?  Did he find somebody more worthy of a beating than you?  No, I gave him the out that he needed.  He didn't really want to get into it, either.  I think he was surprised that I was aggressive back at all.  And he probably figured, what's he going to do?  Don't try to make yourself sound tough in that situation.  Not at all.  But then, figuring he was going to have to give me a beating.  Yeah.  Like, I think he was surprised that it came to anything at all.  And then, like, now I've got to beat this guy's teeth in.  And then I gave him the out he wanted.  And I think that just kind of ended it.  He went away.  Oh, okay. 
[00:25:00]  No, no.  He wasn't.  He would have...  What a wuss he is.  I'd have punched you square in the mouth.  We were in school, though.  So he probably just didn't want to get thrown out.  All right.  We've got to take our first break.  We've got a lot to do today.  Doing in school.  Phones are lit.  I had to act like I didn't want to get suspended either.  I'm like, yeah, I've got to be careful.  I don't want to get suspended.  Yeah, if we know what we know now, who cares?  Get suspended, kids.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  Enjoy your time off.  Enjoy a day or two off.  It's not going to make any difference when you get older. 
[00:25:30]  No.  E-Rock, you awake today?  Good.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to say good morning to Boston.  Wow, what a game last night.  The Pats.  Squeaked by the Ravens, huh?  Still undefeated.  That was a nail-biter, that one.  I didn't get to stay up for the whole game, so as soon as I saw Kenny this morning, I'm  like, what happened?  And then Kenny doesn't know.  Uh, well.  Just tell me, did the Pats win?  One of the teams won. 
[00:26:00]  Well, it was close.  Came down at like the last minute or so.  Who won?  I want the Pats to go undefeated badly.  Yeah.  And I want the Dolphins to go winless.  Yep.  And I want the Jets to continue to be mediocre.  And in the Super Bowl, you want the Cowboys to upset the Patriots.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I mean, I think that's...  What?  Well, that's what I want.  Are you talking about?  That's what I would like to have happen.  I hate the Cowboys. 
[00:26:30]  No, you don't.  They're America's team, bucko.  Are they?  The Braves are America's team.  Ugh.  And Turner tried to get that going.  Yeah, with his superstition.  He wanted everybody to like the Atlanta Braves.  Sorry.  F the Atlanta Braves.  Couldn't do it.  The problem was they didn't win anything.  That's why.  They could have.  They had a shot, but they were so exposed.  But it's like you keep...  I like to say whenever there's a big game, I like to say if you keep getting to the big  dance, but they wouldn't win. 
[00:27:00]  What did you just say?  Instead of the big game, I call it the big dance.  It makes me sense.  The big dance.  But they would never win.  Cowboys won.  You know Hollywood Henderson?  I read his book years ago.  Defensive player for the Cowboys who had a notorious drug problem.  And he said that during the Super Bowl with Pittsburgh, where they lost 35-31, Super  Bowl 13, he was sniffing a vixen inhaler, but he was doing coke.  During the game?  On the sidelines.  Wow.  During the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Yeah, so Thomas Henderson was doing coke out of a vixen inhaler on the sidelines of 
[00:27:30]  the Super Bowl.  Is that wonderful?  That rocks.  Wow.  Millions of Americans watching.  A ballsy move.  Yeah.  Love those old Cowboys.  Bunch of thugs.  No.  Starback was a goody two-shoes.  Good old number 12, tip of the cap.  Right.  There's the defensive player.  Yeah.  That's great.  That team was all over the place.  Just a bunch of druggies.  All right.  We got lots.  And lots to do today.  We got guess the sound.  We got Pinky the Cat. 
[00:28:00]  We got...  Pinky the Cat.  Pinky the Cat rules.  Woman found dead at home after two years.  What?  We got a little taste of audio of us on Imus' first show back yesterday.  What does that happen?  What?  What?  The two-year dead in a house.  That is a person that no one liked.  No.  We're apparently a bad conversationalist.  No one noticed.  We keep walking in.  She smells and says nothing back.  You're like, ah.  All right.  I'll see you next week.  You need anything?  No.  Was it like a radish?  I ran your neck so the smell stops.  I don't even know if that would help. 
[00:28:30]  I just thought it'd be funny to say.  Coffee sip.  Well, it was.  Coffee sip.  What do you call it?  Swim walk.  Swim walk.  Oh, yeah.  A little swim.  Hey, Ranger Rick wants to say something.  Go ahead, Ranger Rick.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  The Islanders suck.  Oh.  That was hurtful.  That was hurtful.  Stupid Bruins.  That wasn't...  I'll acknowledge the stupid Bruins.  3-1 over the Islanders last night.  All right.  A woman found dead at home after two years.  Here we go. 
[00:29:00]  Dead inside her apartment for two whole years.  How is it possible no one found a woman in all that time?  CBS2's Hazel Sanchez, live now in East Flatbush, with more on this tragic discovery.  Hazel.  The mail was piling up.  No one was answering the door.  While the woman's body lay inside her home behind me, neighbors say they called the city  for help.  But their calls went nowhere.  For months, Ruby Fulmer says she worried and wondered about what happened to her next-door  neighbor and friend she identified as Christine Kopman. 
[00:29:30]  Did she go to Trinidad?  Friend?  For some friend.  Some friend you are.  Good friend.  Some friend you are.  Dead for two years.  I like how they say no one was answering the door.  Well, of course.  Of course not.  She's dead.  How could they have been?  There was a body which ironically answered the door every fifth or sixth time someone  came.  Right.  They just, the news is just, they're just idiots.  I love that.  Well, this local resident at least has something to add to the story because she tried calling  the cops.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:30:00]  So that makes sense.  ...door neighbor and friend she identified as Christine Kopman.  Did she go to Trinidad and stay forever?  Did she drop dead in the street in New York?  Is she dead somewhere?  Is she a hospital somewhere?  We didn't know anything.  A 65-year-old Kopman lived alone here at 9 East 92nd Street.  She was widowed, had family in Trinidad, and was estranged from her in-laws in New York  when she seemingly disappeared.  Wow.  Seemingly.  Wow.  I just love that. 
[00:30:30]  You know, that happened one night.  God, my two years.  And then two years of, what, again, the TV on?  Two years of just the sun shining through the window.  Yeah.  And then not shining.  One day after another, just...  Just day after day after day after day.  Pitch blackness at night, perhaps, when they shut the electricity off. 
[00:31:00]  Well, the relatives finally found her dead.  No, she's dead!  That's the relatives right there, I guess.  Yeah.  One of them.  Finally, after nearly two years, Kopman's nephew and sister-in-law showed up.  Met the police here, and finally went into the house.  And found her in the upstairs hall, fully dressed to go out.  Moans.  As Kopman's mail...  Oh!  ...says she and other neighbors reached out for help. 
[00:31:30]  What is the mailman doing?  You put mail in, the door's halfway full of mail.  You steadily put mail in.  What about your light bill in the gas bill?  Police came to the house six months ago, but never went inside.  I had called 311, 911, housing and development and all kinds of people.  And it was nobody's business.  The medical examiner will be performing an autopsy on Kopman to determine her exact cause of death. 
[00:32:00]  But police say so far, it does not appear suspicious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen...  Yeah.  Goodness gracious!  Bones in a nice little outfit to go out with that night.  Oh, man.  Just a skeleton wearing a dress.  I hope she had her best outfit on, too.  Oh, yeah.  Not in the town plan.  She was gonna go out.  So just bones were left?  Just bones.  That's how fast it goes?  I guess.  Two years?  Depends on the atmosphere inside the apartment. 
[00:32:30]  Get some humidity in there.  It's all over.  You're rotting pretty quick.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, that's pretty creepy.  Just that thought of the skeleton, the skull, and the jawbone just kind of...  Like Indiana Jones.  And then in that dress.  In her little party dress.  Where was she going if she didn't know anybody?  Where did it go out?  You think the shoes were on little bony feet? 
[00:33:00]  Or had they fallen off or cracked?  One was a bit askew.  Yeah.  Just a little askew with some toe bones coming out of it.  Her, like, open-toed shoes.  And it's just toe bones with big, long toenails growing out of them.  I can just picture it.  It's a horrific scene.  And where in the house was she?  Like, what was she doing?  I hope she was...  Like, I hope she was on the phone making a proclamation.  And, like, they had found her dead with the phone in one hand and her finger pointing in the up position. 
[00:33:30]  But to make an important statement, she died.  Why that song?  All right.  Play it.  I don't know.  Huh?  Okay.  But this is cancer music.  Yeah.  This is you're still alive, but you're ready to die music.  Yeah, this is cancer music.  This isn't, you know, your bones are laying in a dress on the floor.  Hold on.  I have to nominate the runners-up for worst music selection during a bit ever.  Yes.  Yeah.  And the winner, open this up, is... 
[00:34:00]  What's the category again?  Category, Jim?  It's the worst musical selection for a bit ever.  It's...  E-Rock!  It goes to E-Rock for cancer music where it had no place being played. 
[00:34:30]  Pretty much shutting down the Opie and Anthony show.  Again.  All right.  Pinky the Cat, Jimmy.  What's this about?  Well, my broad sent me a link to it.  And I detest links.  But when you're sleeping with someone, you tend to open them.  Click on one or two.  I love forwards.  I love when it's a big, funny thing and your name is attached to 80 other people that now 
[00:35:00]  have your email address.  And it's just some funny thing.  Oh, a little saying or pictures or patriotic things from the troops.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah.  Sure.  But Pinky the Cat.  Pinky the Cat.  Big hit on YouTube.  Yeah, it was...  I had never seen it.  Apparently, it's been bouncing around for a long time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's this sheriff holding this really cute cat.  And I think it's Pet of the Week.  Looks like Jack-Jack.  And he's giving it away.  And I don't... 
[00:35:30]  Sam got the audio.  I don't know how the audio will translate, but he said it sounds pretty funny because the  video is wonderful.  You want to just play the audio?  I would say, yeah.  Pinky is a little douche.  Pinky is just completely ungrateful.  Yes.  The audio is good.  Pinky is up for adoption.  He goes...  Well...  Yeah.  Cats don't like leashes is what it is, too.  And Pinky's on the leash.  That's not smart.  And the sheriff's holding Pinky.  But then when Pinky wants to maybe wander around a little bit, he's just on the leash and 
[00:36:00]  doesn't like the leash.  And this is what happened.  This is Pinky.  He's a male cat.  Domestic short hair.  He's available for adoption.  He's pet of the week.  Watch your county animal shelter.  He's a very loving cat.  Pinky.  Pinky.  Pinky.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  We got a wild cat on our hands.  Dude.  Watch it.  He's cut up a minute. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's disconnected from the dead.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  What happened was, Pinky's on a leash and not at all happy to be on a leash.  So, Pinky, he's holding the leash, trying to, like, hold this little video presentation  together.  And the cat's jumping all over the place.  Yeah.  And then they're trying to put a box on the cat.  And then the cat wraps around his leg, and that screaming is when the cat crawls up the  sheriff's leg, and those claws go right under where the soft skin would be hanging. 
[00:37:00]  Dig into his groin and upper thigh area.  That scream is fantastic.  And his scream.  We got a follow-up to that story, Pinky the cat.  Oh, really?  I didn't even realize, but we do.  Here it is.  He come in the house, told me, don't have to worry about shit on the floor no more.  I took care of it.  What Charles White says his son Lonnie did to a kitten from this black cat's litter may  sound disturbing.  The thing was, he couldn't hold his head up.  He was shivering. 
[00:37:30]  He was shaking, you know.  He took, I had a hammer.  Deputies say what Lonnie White did to the kitten next got him arrested.  First time he hit it, he missed it.  He hit it in the body, I guess, or something.  He was crying.  White says his son wasn't finished with the hammer.  Then the next time he hit it in the head, he didn't put it out of his misery.  White says his son threw the dead kitten in the woods, later burying it in the backyard  at his request.  I mean, he's not a damn serial killer or something.  He tells NBC2 the events that led up to the fatal blow were never told to deputies.  I had a chair up like this. 
[00:38:00]  I went to get up.  Sounds like him.  Like that, I heard a squawk.  Had a broken neck or a broken back already.  White says if anyone is to blame for the dead kitten, it's him.  I did it on accident.  I got...  I was trying to make a...  Yeah.  A silly segue with an old news story, but it didn't work.  Pinky the cat.  Buried him in his shoebox.  He had back.  Mm-hmm.  The great thing about the pinky video is that the cat's on a leash, and it wraps a couple  of times around his leg, almost like a barber pole.  Yeah.  So the cat is really embedded. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  There's nowhere else for him to go.  And it's like, why would they...  First of all, the cat's just being angry by doing that.  You're not going to climb any higher.  Oh, the cat knows exactly where to dig his claws.  And then just dug his claws in, and that sheriff, the screams, please, I just have to hear the  sheriff's scream.  You know how many suspects he's arrested that have never made him make that sound?  I just had fights in bars.  Stupid Pinky.  Pinky the cat.  And just tore down the whole house.  And people are also noticing that they love the tweeting birds in the background. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, it sounds like a very peaceful scene.  Yeah.  This is Pinky.  He's a male cat.  Domestic short hair.  He's available for adoption.  He's pet of the week.  Blaster County Animal Shelter.  He's a very loving cat.  Oh, you've got to pull those little claws out. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah!  That was like an ape scream.  That's like evolutionary.  Yeah!  Oh, is that fantastic?  Isn't it amazing how stupid Pinky... 
[00:40:00]  Certain things just make your social graces go, and a claw in the groin will do it every  time.  Absolutely.  We'll link that video up on onaradio.com.  Pinky the cat.  Also, on onaradio.com, if you're a big fan of CokeLogic's animations, he's got a brand  new one for you to check out, okay?  Everyone, everyone has, I think, had the episode where you're holding the cat, and it wants  to get away, and tries to climb over your shoulder. 
[00:40:30]  And when you try to hold it there, it just takes those claws and digs in to your shoulder,  and all the way down your back, as it tries to just get away from you.  You've just got to let go of a cat when it's trying to get away from you.  Yeah.  Just let him go, because he'll win.  Cat claws are awful.  Oh!  Pointy little things.  Yeah.  Those teeth, too.  Can we play Steven Lynch's Kill a Kitten into break here, or what?  They can dump out of one line?  Yeah.  Of course. 
[00:41:00]  Can't we clean it up so they don't dump out of it, so it'll be too long of a beep?  Why don't we take it out and reverse it?  Wow.  It's a song we've played hundreds of times, and now they beep out.  And look at the line they beep out.  That's ridiculous.  Ah, why get mad, right?  Yeah!  Who gives a crap, right?  Screw it.  Why care?  That's not that long of a beep.  You want to try it?  Try it.  All right, we've got to try it.  I mean, you know, this is a perfect spot to play Kill a Kitten by our old pal Steven Lynch 
[00:41:30]  on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's a sing-along, too, so everybody feel free to join in.  Follow the bouncing balls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting,  It helps a lot if you kill a kitten.  Mark my words, cause from where I'm sitting, 
[00:42:00]  You can't go wrong if you kill a kitten.  Look at those balls.  There's no crime that you'll be committing  I know the law, you can, everybody, kill a kitten 
[00:42:30]  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting  You'll get plenty when you kill a kitten  Feed it turpentine  Or break its spine  Crush it with your shoe  As long as you  Kill a kitten  Kill a kitten 
[00:43:00]  Listen up  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten  She'll like you better when you kill a kitten  And I'll quote the Bible cause that's where it's written  If he loveth Jesus  He must kill a kitten  Throw him at a train 
[00:43:30]  Make him snort cocaine  Drown him in a lake  Bake a kitty cake  Flush him down the can  Hit him with your van  Stick some tea and tea  Up his cat booty  And do what you must do  As long as you  Kill a kitten  Kill a kitten 
[00:44:00]  Meow  Kill a kitten  You got to kill a kitten  All right  Killing kittens  Killing kittens  Isn't easy  And if the thought  Makes you feel queasy  Grab a pitchfork  From the shed

No  I was in the club  With the Philly crew  And we were actually  Partying with some of the Eagles  They were in town  For the weekend  And I saw Artie  Knock this guy  Out  Cold  Knocked him the F out  It was one of these club posers 
[00:47:00]  And this guy  We're like near the railing  And we're all looking down  At the partiers  Down below  Just rock and rolling  Just people watching  Having a good time  Having a couple cocktails  And Artie doesn't drink  But this section  Was set aside  For like VIP  And all that  And one of these  Party dudes  Comes up  And looks at Artie  And accuses him  Of stealing his bottle of vodka  You know  You buy a bottle of vodka  For five, six hundred dollars  And Artie's like  What are you talking about?  I don't even drink  I didn't take your bottle 
[00:47:30]  And the guy insisted  That Artie took the bottle  And got it in Artie's face  And then the bouncers  Came over  And I saw Artie  Reach around  The bouncer  And knocked this guy out  Cold  Cold  Right on the ground  And then  Cold  And then all his friends  Came running over to Artie  Artie picks up a freaking  Who else was there?  I was the only one  I'm looking around  Yeah  I was not  I heard about it after  Artie picks up a chair  Like a lion tamer  And he's like  Back, back, back  Fending off the crowd  Fending off  This guy's  You know

[00:53:30]  Have to  Pay attention  To the fact  That retailers  Are obligated  To pay  The rent  They're obligated  To pay what  Retailers are obligated  To pay rent  To the retail REIT  Which means  That  Which means  That  Are you okay  Bob  Okay

[00:54:30]  But  Yeah  I think he started thinking  Oh my god  People are watching me  Right now  Yeah  Or something  Oh my god  There's a lot of people  Watching this  Yeah  He just decided  Oh god  I  Ah  The  The  Investors  Would  I believe the investors  The  That's what he sounded like

[00:55:30]  Among the retail reasons  Which is the  Area that I follow  I think the area  Has been hard hit by concerns  About  Slowing consumer spending  And slower retail growth  While we do expect  Retail growth  To slow in 2008  I think investors have to  Uh oh  I think investors have to  Uh oh  Uh oh  I think investors have to  Um  Uh oh  Pay attention to the fact that  Retailers are obligated to pay  The rent 
[00:56:00]  Uh oh  Oh no  They're obligated to pay what?  Retailers are obligated to pay  Rent  To the retail rates  Which  Means that  Which means that  Are you okay?  Bob  Uh  Okay uh  Jim  Bob will come back to you  In just one second  Jim are you with me?  Jim are you with me?

[00:57:30]  Making the rounds too  Huh  That uh  Audio  Oh yeah  It's all over the sites  That's a biggie  Everyone loves it  Hey uh  We cut out early yesterday  Went to see uh  The iMans  Mr. Imus  Do his first radio show  After being uh  Fired  Uh huh  And uh  He put us on the air  For like two minutes  Was it two?  I thought it was about 58 seconds  I don't know  I think the iMans  Was a little nervous  Having us on  Could have picked two worse people  To put on his first show back 
[00:58:00]  I know  I know  Just loose cannons  What's the matter  Did John Valby cancel?  We're just idiots though  We  Valby  Yeah  John Valby  John Valby  Valby  Oh  John Valby  Okay  John Valby  John Valby  Um  I'm an us  Us  We just figured that someone  In radio  Needed to be there  To support his uh  His comeback  I think we're the only ones 
[00:58:30]  Yeah  We just felt like  It was the thing to do  You know  Yeah  So we went down to town hall  And uh  We just showed up  Just to show a little support  And then he threw us on the air  Which like you said  I think he was very nervous  To have live mics  In front of us  Yeah  And boy  We were thinking of some doozies  Apparently  I read  I read that um  Bo Deedle  Said something like uh  Hey Al Roker  Says hi  And um  I almost kind of looked at him  Like you know  Ugh  Don't do this to me  Yeah  And then gestured with his finger 
[00:59:00]  Like it was a gun  And he was pulling the trigger  Oh really  Yeah  Like  Knock it off  Idiot  Who's Bo Deedle  He's one of his uh  Uh  Guests  Yeah  One of five of his friends  An investigator or something  That guy who played music was good  What was his name  Leon something  Or  Levon Helm  I liked him  He was  He's from the band  You ever hear the music from the band  No  Yeah you have  I know you have  Take a load off  Ranny  Take a load off  Ranny 
[00:59:30]  Up on Cripple Creek  Any of that stuff  No  Up on Cripple Creek  She  Why would I know that  No  You know what  I didn't even know that  Until you just said  That that was the dude from the band  Yeah  Yeah he's the drummer  He also played  He's the drummer  He was the drummer  But he's also singing  They all sang  He also played  Um  I believe the father  In Coal Miner's Daughter  Oh no kidding  Yeah  Oh you know everything  I think that was  Levon Helm  Alright well we got audio of us on Imus  It's quick 
[01:00:00]  And uh  You know  We felt like  Someone had to be there  So we  We stopped down  A lot of people were like  Yeah  Surprised that we stopped in  But  We started supporting a fellow radio guy  That you know  Got into some trouble  Got into touch  If anybody should support that  It's you know us  It was a good day for radio in general  Black white  Whatever  Yeah  It was a good day for black radio hosts  But they don't want to acknowledge that  But it's good to know  That you could come back  From something  That you see on the radio  An oopsie  When you're just trying to entertain  Your listeners 
[01:00:30]  And Linda Stacey  Or Stassi  Whatever  She's just disgusting  Just a self-righteous  She's a writer for the New York Post  She's an ultra-liberal woman  And uh  Which is fine  But she's just such a biased  Hyper  Oh yeah  She's a hen  She's everything you hate  I don't even have the article in front of me  I just hate her guys  Well let's try to get her on the show  She would never  She hates the show  Well let's give her a call  She won't come on the show  Give her a call  Let's see if she'll come on the show today  Well let's try  But she just hated the fact that 
[01:01:00]  Imus got to  Of course she did  Come back  And what'd she say about a leper  Oh the leper refuses to change his spots  Leper  Leper refuses to change his spots  She's basically saying that the Rutgers women  Shouldn't have accepted his apology  Stop  You know she's just  And meanwhile  When Chappelle released his  The Lost Episodes  Or the Comedy Central  Yeah  It's the greatest review I've ever seen  Oh I know  She gave it this  Four stars  Magnificent review  It's funny  Cutting edge  Which is again  Fine  It is  I'm not taking anything away from Chappelle  But it's like 
[01:01:30]  Just  It's amazing how people judge  Certain forms of humor  Differently  She's just  She just  Sucks  And she's not a funny writer  That's her greatest curse  Yeah  She's not a good writer  She's horrid  Don't try to be funny when you're writing  If you're not funny  No  She actually said  I put my seatbelt on  While I was watching  Because I was going to fall out  Did you  Does she have seatbelts in her couch  At home  I hope so  I hope she hangs herself with him by accident  While she's  While she's looking for something to eat  In between the sofa cushions  Stupid bitch  Hater  Well here's our very brief appearance

Well because of  Some problem with  Insurance  Yeah there it is  Yeah  That's when Bob  When you talk to me  Hello  Anthony  It's 
[01:09:30]  Oh god  I was talking with  Some people  And  There's just  You guys  Have gotta do something  It's getting really bad  I'm so sorry  I had to talk to him  Because  I got my  Insurance  Thing  You know  My health insurance  What's that?  Health insurance  You know  You pay  You get your health insurance  The bill comes in 
[01:10:00]  You pay  So I got the bill  And it was  A ridiculous amount of money  And apparently  There's some gentleman  On my policy  Yeah  That I'm paying for  What is he getting  Like a lung transplant?  I have no idea  But his premiums  Are through the roof  It's this guy  I don't even know  What his name is  Please don't say  Greg Hughes  Please don't  No no  His last name  Is like  Roberson  Or something 
[01:10:30]  And there's  Social security numbers  Right there  And everything  I should just  Give it out  On the internet  So people can  Do identity theft  On him  How long  Has he been  Paying for him?  A month  It's a month  But the thing is  With stupid insurance companies  You can't just write  Because the first thing  I did was  I circled his name  On the bill  And wrote  Don't know this guy  He does not belong  On this  Blah blah blah  And you expect  The people to  Acknowledge your  Exactly  Your scribble  On a bill  That's your first mistake 
[01:11:00]  I know  I'm thinking  It's like 1950  Where some old guy  Is going to open it up  And go  Well let me read this  It all just goes  Through a computer  No one reads crap  You know what that guy does  Stamp  And just throws it aside  Exactly  And then I get  A bill  Which says  You know  You got to pay this  Or we're going to  Cancel your insurance  So now  I got to pay  This outlandish  Amount of money  Why is his insurance  So high  Do you have any  I have no idea  What do you think  How much higher  Is it than yours  Twice  Twice  Twice  Wow  Bill from Waterford

[01:20:30]  Me and Jimbo just did a big show together  I was really pumped to be here  And then you know  It's like Blue Ball  Comedy Blue Ball  For an hour and a half  It was a bad timing  So I come in early  They asked me to come in early  You know figure  You know of course  I'll come in early  Holy crap Bob Saget is here  Awesome  Awesome  That I'm cool with  Because he's my pal  I love Saget  And he has a normal hair  Oh were you telling a story  And by the way  I saw his Broadway show  And it's awesome  Yeah 
[01:21:00]  The drowsy chaperone  Yeah  You can't walk around Manhattan  Without seeing advertising  Yeah  Oh I know  There's posters everywhere  He's worldwide  He's big time  Yeah we like Bob Saget  But it was just one of those things Jeffrey  No no no that's not good enough  It has to be good enough  At least it can be a proper introduction  Or something  It has to be good enough  I just thought you were like  Taking me for granted  You know like when you're at a party  Can I tell you what happened  You're having a good time  At your birthday party  And then somebody famous walks in  And suddenly you ignore your family  And your friends  I'll be completely  That's what that was  I'll be completely honest  Really is this what this is  I'll be completely honest with you 
[01:21:30]  We were thinking that  We were going to say no to you  Not because we had a very busy show  That would have been polite  No but  Two days of my life  But you're a friend of the show  So like alright  We'll try to figure out  How to make it work  And then it didn't work obviously  And Ken Burns  You know  Likes to talk a bit  But his stories were  You know  They were interesting  Hey Jeff  You've heard of  Of a documentary  You've made a documentary  Something to work me into  And didn't even know  You were in the room  I know  He had his back to me  Like he was inside 
[01:22:00]  The actor's studio  And he ran the interview  He was running  The Ken Burns interview  That was  I gotta say  I understand where  Both parties are coming from  Because as a comedian  I've gone to other radio shows  But here it is  It really wasn't anything personal  Because no one said  I didn't take him personally  I was just like  These schmucks are still  Not producing their own show  They're double booking me  And it's like  Out of politeness  Either tell me not to come in  Or get me in and out before  Or have me at least introduced  A minute before  Dude honestly 
[01:22:30]  We thought  Hold on hold on hold on  Because we do produce our show  Secondly  I didn't mean it like that  I meant generally speaking  Secondly  Secondly we thought  We thought we would get  15-20 minutes out of Ken Burns  This is where we sit  You never know what's gonna happen  Hey do you mind sticking around  For a little while  Yeah you're really  Well no  Because at that point  We wanted to continue with him  If you want to get into this  I'll get into this  There is some times where  Opie will say that  Where it's like  Uh oh  No no no  We don't do that anymore  But not  Yeah  We knew he was  He was getting the job done 
[01:23:00]  The phones were lit  And at that point  15-20 minute segment  With Ken Burns  Where we decided  We should probably go along  With this guy  He's doing well  I'm not saying  It wasn't interesting  I'm saying  And then I'm looking at you  Like ah crap  How do we  You didn't need to have me here  Is what I'm saying  Well but you know what  We didn't know that  Until it happened  You know  He's still pissed man  I was pissed  I left Sunday morning  I left all my friends  Left the sunshine  To fly here  To come three days early  To see my pals  Obviously didn't book 
[01:23:30]  Any other media  Because why would I  If I got the best show in town  On my schedule  What would be the point  Of like running around  To other shows  So now I'm  You know  Got my  In my hand  For two days  Going what the hell  Would I come here for  Oh wow  In the freezing cold  By myself  In my lonely apartment  It was lame  I leave here at 9am  With nothing to do  No one knows  I'm in town  Were you angry  All day  I told everybody  I'm going to be  In an O.A.  I didn't even say hello  Were you angry  All day yesterday 
[01:24:00]  Oh it was horrible  I never ever  Get like that  That makes me really happy  I hate that side of me  I went to the gym  From here  And just beat a bag  Anthony didn't even  Know you were here  Don't blame it on me  I was conducting  An interview  Because me and Jeff  Jeff Ross  Had some  You know  Eye contact  You could have  Carried on  A great conversation  With Jeff  You were in position  I even said  Before Ken Burns  Came in  I'm like  Ant this is yours man  You're a big war guy  You're really into this 
[01:24:30]  You saw the documentary  I had respect  We all jumped on your back  And let you carry us  And it was your responsibility  To work Jeff Ross  Into the show  My god  Look at how he's  He's right  And by the way  Thank you Jeff  You were half asleep  Darn it  What?  No I wasn't  You were bored  I'm not a big war guy  But I thought  It was pretty interesting  He was very interesting  And his letters were beautiful  At the very least  You know what  It's not like I'm here  Promoting butt plugs  I made a documentary  There's a way to transition 
[01:25:00]  And go  Jeff do you have a question  For him  Jeff have you guys  Ever met  Jeff have you seen  Anything at all  To be a good host  Do you have anything  You'd like to ask Bob Saget  Yes  I'll tell you this much  I thought I was  Going to be bored  By the whole thing  And Anthony did a great job  And when he started talking  I really got into it  I thought it would be like  Ah whatever  Ken Burns in and out  Some people will find it interesting  But he really  He brought the whole audience  Together yesterday  He's a storyteller  It's what he did  When I heard he was coming  I thought it was cool  To meet him  He was very nice  Why didn't you make fun 
[01:25:30]  Of his hair in front of him  I was so pissed off  I wasn't going to give you guys  The benefit of a gem  Of my comedy  I was not going to interrupt  To try to get a barb in  You know like  See Anthony  I'll say this for you  Because Anthony  Is a big big  Ken Burns fan  It was like a long time  Coming getting him in the studio  I understand  Ken loves him  And it was one of those things  Where in a way  You're right about  It is like when  You got your friends here  And you ignore it  When the famous guy  Right  But it's not  But it's not  That's kind of the way  The show is  It's not done to be scummy 
[01:26:00]  It really is  It's like well  You're Jeff  You're a member of the family  Like that's kind of the way  It's looked at  Almost like one of our  Okay I respect that  That's all that was  And you're watching  Ant just conduct an interview  With a guy he loved  I hardly said anything  Ant didn't know  I was in the room  And I just watched him  Talking to Ken  And he was like  What about when you do this  And what about  Like Ant was like  Unloading all these questions  He had been wanting  I was so worried about  Getting a good interview  That I don't think  I had it in me  To go the back and forth thing 
[01:26:30]  Where I would then  Turn my seat around  Did you even realize  That Jeff Ross was in the room  I knew Jeff Ross  Was in the room  You instigator  What's wrong with this seat  Could have two of us here  Well we don't like  Having two guys on the couch  It's a little weird  Well then you should have  Moved me to a different time  Or told me to come  A different day  That's all I'm saying  Yes and that isn't  My responsibility  All right well there you go  Work on that  Yeah we'll do that  I was taking it for granted  I love you guys  I'll sit here and watch you guys  Do a show any day of the week  But if I'm booked  It's just like at least  Say Jeff's here 
[01:27:00]  It was like  You didn't even say  I was a comedian  You were like  Jeff Ross and Ken Burns  And then it was just like  The last time you mentioned me  That was embarrassing  You know I'm going to have  To listen to some of that audio  My family was listening  It was so embarrassing  Hey I'm coming to town  You want to eat me from  No I can't  I'm going right to ONA  From the airport  I haven't been on in forever  So much to say  I'm so excited  And it's just like  What?  If we could pull  Any references we made  Yesterday  Some kid wants to open  For me at the stress factory  So he emails me  Very funny on the radio yesterday 
[01:27:30]  I knew he was lying  I knew there was no way  He heard it  I want to hear  I want to hear  Any little references  We made to Jeff yesterday  During that segment  And hear how insignificant  They were  You have to spend five years  At the National Archives  To find those references  Digging through  The National Archives  We found an extra second  On each end of the shot  Really?  My hotel got hit  With a mortar explosion  You queer  Could have said this  To his face there Jeff  Yeah I don't want to  Interrupt the genius 
[01:28:00]  Interview  Anthony never would have  Talked to me again  Oh  So when you pan across  The picture  Does that take  That takes a lot of skill  Woo  It's a technique  That I appreciate  And thought it was  Very clever  When you have  Something like  The Civil War  It's called  The Ken Burns effect  There Jeffrey Ross  Oh right  And this is  The Jeffrey Ross effect  An angry Jew  You are steamed  I sound like  Pat Cooper  Really  I deserve respect  Oh god 
[01:28:30]  I was so mad  I hate that  You marched right out of here  And I was  Well I didn't  Actually I calmly  Put my coat on  Looked around  There was nobody around  They were all like  And I was just like  I remember thinking  I went out in the hall  Took a leak  Came back  Everybody  I left  I remember thinking  Am I going to walk around  And go thanks for the opportunity  To listen to that  For a close up  I do remember thinking  I remember thinking  At the end of the show  Where's Jeff Ross  And I went  Oh well  You should have thought that  During the show  I was like  Oh well  It's my turn  For a picture  With Ken Burns  I know 
[01:29:00]  I was like  Hey could you sign  My father's Christmas present  Right  I would have vomited  Hey where's Jeff  Ah  It's my turn  For a photo op  Yeah  What can I tell you  It happens  Photo with Ken Burns  You know what  You should get that photo  And pan across it  Real slow  Here dad  Here dad  It has the Ken Burns effect  You made a documentary  So you should appreciate  Ken Burns  And what he does  For documentaries  Well I would have appreciated  With some  He made it possible  For people to watch documentaries  Before that  No one was watching these things 
[01:29:30]  I'm not giving him credit  He's amazing  What he's done  I mean  He did so much  For the Civil War veterans  He really gave them  The respect they deserve  Nobody ever remembers  Anything about them  Well the families appreciate it  It was mostly  World War II stuff  We were talking about  It was awesome  I'm not saying  He's not awesome  The Daughters of the Confederacy  Yeah you'll get a lot of fans  A lot of new fans  From the Daughters of the Confederacy  Will be knocking down your door  Alright  I'm just saying  It wasn't polite 
[01:30:00]  Alright where are you  Going to be whining  This weekend  Oh jeez man  Where's your plug  I don't even know  Where are you going to be whining  The Stress Factory  Stress Factory  Vinny's Club  Vinny Brand's Club  And then the Improv  In Irvine all weekend  Wait you're only  At the Stress Factory  One night  Yeah  When tomorrow  Tonight  Tomorrow  Tomorrow night  732-545  Ha ha  4242  Because Vinny puts a laugh in  So you can remember  What you're supposed to do  With the club  I changed the number 
[01:30:30]  To wah wah  This weekend  You're even admitting  I'm right  I thought I handled  It pretty well  I will certainly  Admit you're right  But we're in  One of those situations  That happens  Not a lot  To be honest with you  But when you know  Good radio  You gotta continue  With the good radio  Perhaps I'm not  Talented enough  To carry on  A dual conversation  Like that  As soon as I knew  That Anthony  Had his back to you  I knew that was  Gonna be a problem  I'm not saying  A dual conversation  But you know what  Take two minutes  And go Jeff  Thanks for coming by 
[01:31:00]  No the studio  Is not set up right  There are times  You gave me a joke plug  As the show was ending  It was like  Well you know  It is actually  An awkward studio  To do something  At the XM studio  It's just the nature  Of the way the console is  You have Ant  All the way to the far left  And then you have  An empty mic  And then you have myself  Which a lot of people  Consider an empty mic  Oh  Snams himself  And then you have  And then you have a mic  To my right  Which is empty 
[01:31:30]  And then around  The kind of thing  Faces  So it's actually  To have five people  Sitting there  Actually kind of works  Like a bunch of guys  That are around  These are all great excuses  But the point is  It's true  Coming at 730  I left at 9  And didn't say boo  Wow is it that long  Yeah  So what are you trying  To say today  I'm happy to be here  Alright good  That's what I want to hear  Stress factory  Tomorrow night  Jeff Ross  Just you know what it is  You get mad at somebody  Who you don't care about  It's like who cares  It's so busy  You walk out of here  You never go back  But when it's your friends  You go really 
[01:32:00]  Is this what that was  It sucked  It sucked  But you  You're smart enough  To realize  I'm feeling bad  But you're smart enough  To realize  We weren't  What I am  Go ahead  We weren't dissing you  On purpose or anything  It was just one of those things  Which sucks  And I apologize for that  But it wasn't like  You were taking me for granted  As if I was here  Half no man  There are times  That what happened to you  Happens for real  Because we're like  Ugh this guy stinks  And we gotta focus over here  Well maybe I thought that too  That wasn't the  You know that wasn't the case  If we were a professional show 
[01:32:30]  I would say that  That was unprofessional of us  You are a professional show  No  It's time to own that  And man up to that  Oh Jesus  The show's huge  Yeah but we're  We're hanging on  By the skin of our  Friggin teeth here  Is that true?  Just  Yeah you know  You conduct an interview  With someone on the couch  And my back is to  The comedian behind me  Jeffrey Ross  I felt like I was  An actual booked guest  Sorry  I was stopping by  With muffins  You know because of you  We're gonna have the  Jeffrey Ross effect 
[01:33:00]  We're gonna have to like  Redesign the studio  I like that  It's a slow pan over my  Suicide note  Angry face  Anthony decided not to do  A slow pan to his left  Not once  I kept focus  Anthony decided  Who was more important  In the studio  I don't even start that  Well I do  Only because I know  He's a genuine fan  Like if it was Ozzy  Sitting in that thing  I wouldn't care  Who was in that chair  I would just  And I've done it before 
[01:33:30]  And I just  I focus only on the couch  Well clear the room  And make it work  But you don't  But you don't think of that  And I'm  I've been in both  Again I've been in both  Sides  Like I've certainly been  In Jeff's position before  I've gone to radio shows  And you're like  Jesus I feel kind of stupid  Just sitting here  It is embarrassing  But then being here every day  I do kind of see like  You know once in a while  It just happens  And it's never  Any bad reason  And with the  Yeah  I'm sorry  Someone is saying  Someone is saying  You had the best question yesterday  Yeah  Carl go ahead  That's what I'm trying to say  I have made a similar movie 
[01:34:00]  And gotten similar mail  Carl go ahead  I'm not saying  I want to conduct the interview  I'm not saying  I'm as accomplished  As Ken Burns  But I'm saying  I'm sitting here  But I pointed  I'm booked  I kind of gave you a look like  Like try to jump in  Not my style  This is Anthony's interview  And honestly  You know like the times  That I've been here  With other huge guests  Have been the best times  The Rock and stuff like that  Put me next to the guy  I'm not going to interrupt you  I'm not going to  Honestly  Hold on hold on  We thought you would be uncomfortable  That couch is not 
[01:34:30]  Big enough for two guys  No I'm serious  For the most part  We do exactly what we did yesterday  But you know what  It might be fine  Between Ken Burns and his ego  The couch was full  Did his barber  Was he here too  I like the fact  That he's now  Taking it out  On Ken Burns  I'm so mad at him  I'm not going to watch  The last nine hours  Of his documentary  Hey Carl  Go ahead  Jeff Ross in studio  Talking finally today 
[01:35:00]  You asked a good question yesterday  You asked him  What can we learn  About this world  That we learned  From past words  And I thought  That was very  That's true  Yeah that was a good  Yeah so much for your  Great interview Anthony  I know I missed that one  What did we learn today  That Jeff Ross  Has better questions  Than Anthony  Yeah  I appreciate that buddy  I should have sat behind you  Unless you  It proves a bigger point  That it was a very interesting guest  You did a great interview Anthony  Thank you sir  I'm just saying  There's another level there 
[01:35:30]  Of just simple protocol  Of like  You're going to book somebody  I didn't ask  I didn't show up at the door  And like watch  I was like  I was booked  I had an agenda  And on top of that  I was really excited  To come in  So the whole thing  It's kind of like  Letterman though  Like someone gets bounced  Then they don't get on  Then they don't get on  Then you leave me out there  He doesn't bring the author on  To just sit there  And then go  We would have talked to this guy  But we ran out of time  We bounced you  We still brought you 
[01:36:00]  Out on the couch though  So we'll have you back  At a later date  But no that's a good point  Letterman does do that  Letterman doesn't  From what I understand  But Letterman has  Bumped comedians before  He at least gives them  A dinner and a limo  For tonight  But at least you're in the  But you are in the green room  Like he does keep you  For the whole hour  And at least  Letterman would never  Book like the next day  He'd say oh sorry  About that just coming back  Alright listen  We gotta take a break  Bob Saget's gonna join the program  We'll try to make sure  The time is equal  Between you two  No no no I'm good  I'm good  It's all about Saget now  This is his night  I crashed today  I respect that  I have my moment  I love Bob Saget

[01:41:00]  Good call back  Alright sir  Hey where's the sound  Hey hey  We're trying to figure out  What this is  Boss sagen is losing it 
[01:41:30]  That's when  After Jeffrey Ross  Left here yesterday  That's what he did  to a lady in his hallway.  Ken Burns is making a documentary about it.  It's going to take six years to complete.  Oh, gosh.  He sounded like the laziest.  He's like, an assistant gave me these letters,  and I sent an assistant to the National Arch...  What?  Are you upset about something?  The guy makes brilliant documentaries. 
[01:42:00]  All right, well, when I have four months to kill,  I'll watch one.  You know, Jeff made a documentary, too.  I know, I saw it.  You can't believe more people don't ask him about it.  Bob is the worst.  You were good in it, by the way.  Thank you.  Patriot Act, Amazon.com.  It was about vaudeville, right?  Yeah.  Bob, that's all we need.  Another instigator.  I love Bob.  He just likes to poke, poke, poke.  We're working together in Vegas.  He's doing a half hour...  Yeah, at the joint,  and he's going to do a half hour complaining,  and then I'm going to come out and entertain the people. 
[01:42:30]  I do a warm down.  That's right.  I hear they set the mic up for you,  and then he just gets behind you.  Well, they hook it up for me,  but then he can't unscrew it to lower it for himself.  It's about 20 minutes just that.  Why the heck the mic hooked up for Saget?  I can't...  What, do I need a step stool for this?  Stop, stop.  Didn't they know I was opening?  What the hell's going on?  After you leave the stage,  they turn off the mic.  I forget to turn it back on. 
[01:43:00]  When are you guys at the joint?  Sometime in the summer.  I don't know.  Jeff will try to change it.  That date doesn't work for me.  I got cartoons the next day.  You got a bar mitzvah or something right after you do that, right?  Yeah, we can't hang out, but we'll do the one night.  I was telling Bob Saget off mic,  I'm like, you're on a roll these days.  He goes, I'm the star of the drowsy chaperone.  I'm like, no, I know that,  but your career is rocking right now.  I have a wiener problem.  I'm like Jeff.  If you get me started on where I've been 
[01:43:30]  and how much I've suffered in the trenches.  What do you see the show, fellas?  What do you see the show that he's on?  We were supposed to before he came in here,  but I figured, you know what?  The long strike is what happened.  Bob is a really, really good friend of our show.  I love you guys.  Never has to wait.  I really love you guys.  We love Bob.  You would never have cut me off like you did.  No.  Our first meeting with Bob was not good.  Our first time with Bob.  No, that's true.  What happened?  It was on the phone.  I was working some hell hole.  It was a great place in Jersey, 
[01:44:00]  and I called in, and you guys,  I was late,  and I thought you guys were pissed at me,  and you weren't.  I don't think.  I don't know.  Maybe you were.  Bob thought we were...  Oh, we never really got to you.  This was years ago.  Yeah, no, I remember.  They were a douche in them,  and then I saw them at a Caroline's thing.  Same thing.  For the aristocrats,  I said, hi, Bob,  and I talked about the Opie and Anthony show.  He goes, oh, yeah, those guys,  they blew me off.  I'm like, no, they didn't,  and I explained what happened,  and then you wound up coming in.  And I saw you on the plane like the next day.  Yeah, that was kind of weird.  Which was really coincidental.  And I proved to you that I had my little XM tuner,  so you knew I was listening.  Yeah, well, I couldn't really get a word in edgewise 
[01:44:30]  with a male stewardess  that was trying to pick up on you.  Yeah, he knew that one day I'd be doing theater.  Wait a minute.  Was I trying to take credit for our friendship with Bob,  and then Anthony just stole credit?  Oh, yeah, completely stole credit.  No, Anthony walked through an airport with Bob Saget once,  and he came back with a full report  saying this guy can't walk anywhere.  He walked through an airport.  It's amazing.  They tag me.  And then he just drops the C-bomb  on mothers with children.  They're asking for it, right?  Of course they are. 
[01:45:00]  They're mothers with children.  No, that's not nice.  Let's give Jeffrey a chance to jump in here.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Oh, God, now you're going to play that.  Jeffrey, do you have something to say?  I saw the Drowsy Chaperone opening weekend,  and it's phenomenal.  Bob Saget is a star, and the best thing,  well, no, I mean, it's an awesome, awesome show,  but seeing Saget in a Broadway show  doing a starring role is something that I'll never forget.  It was very inspiring as a comedian,  and I was really happy for him as his friend.  That's very nice.  And what is the show about? 
[01:45:30]  What can we learn about this war?  The show is nine hours long.  It's like Showa, the documentary about the...  There's some slow pans over your face.  Yeah.  There's a bedpan over my face.  Because, you know, I like that whole thing.  I'm into that.  I'm a scatological.  But this thing is a Tony...  It won five Tony Awards,  and it was written by Bob Martin,  who's a great comedian from...  Writer, improv, brilliant guy.  I love getting a bunch of guys together,  and we sit and watch the Tonys.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:46:00]  Get a drink, and chips, dips.  Did you see the parody of the insult dog?  Did you see that whole thing  where he talked to all the people in the Tony line?  It was really...  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I don't think I've watched the Tony Awards show  in my life, ever.  I saw a great show last night,  the Farnsworth invention,  this thing with Hank Azaria,  this great thing.  Let me talk about my show.  Are you Mr. Broadway now?  I'm completely theater queer.  I don't know what to do.  I came here,  I want to put on like a Rip Taylor wig 
[01:46:30]  and just a Joanne Worley outfit.  She's in the play.  She's in Drowsy Shabro.  Is that it?  Because I saw her on a talk show the other day.  Yeah, The View.  She was talking about the...  Is it just me?  Or the Today Show.  She was on Today Show.  Or makeup or something?  Or does she look like she did like years ago?  She looks the same to me.  Yeah, she hasn't really changed.  No.  She's a Joanne Worley.  Hello.  Who is the next boutique?  Joanne Worley was like a...  She was a Pounder.  She was a Pounder Martin's Laugh-In.  Yeah, she was a Laugh-In.  Whoa. 
[01:47:00]  She's a good comedian.  How old is she?  I don't know.  Maybe 40.  I don't know.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  I think she has an eyelash that's 40.  But she's a nice...  She's great.  She's great in it.  The cast is like amazing.  And you sing.  And Beth Lebel won the Tony for playing Drowsy Chaper.  I'll just tell you what it is.  Yeah, I can't really tell about singing.  Because if people want to see it...  This is the kind of thing that your listeners who I...  Well, by the way, I'll go to the tour in a minute.  But that was like one of the greatest summers of my life. 
[01:47:30]  Doing the thing with you guys.  This is the opposite of that.  But this can entertain those people too.  I think Jeff would back me up on that.  I think it's an all-American sort of night out.  I mean, it's a good chance...  I don't know if you're going to bring your buddy.  It's not...  I mean, it's not the first...  You could if you're doing it.  I mean, I did.  It is the theater.  You know, if you're wearing real shorts.  Like short shorts and a fleece.  But to bring your family or to bring kids or to bring a girlfriend, it's a great, great date.  It's awesome.  I'll bring the whole...  You bring the what? 
[01:48:00]  I'll bring the whole family.  No, no.  Just bring the...  That's great.  Just bring the broad.  Does this thing have...  Is it like Venus de Milo or does it have all the parts?  I wouldn't know.  Right.  I just...  I just realized I was on the 3FM.  He just sees the part.  It's a sick pack.  And it's emotional.  Yeah, fam.  Yeah.  You're talking about...  So this...  I just wrecked everything.  This show is...  Sorry, man.  It's my fault.  Bring it.  No, no, no.  I was going somewhere that was filthy.  Well, you could say it.  You could probably...  Well, he had to just stop.  He had...  All right.  All right.  It's fine. 
[01:48:30]  Hey, Bob, I noticed on the sheet here really fast, too, that they're bringing back one  versus a hundred.  Yeah, on January 4th, it comes back.  I think I might be the biggest fan of that show.  I don't understand why it's not as big as a deal or no deal.  I think you're like the nicest person in the world.  I think it's because they gave you Friday night.  They should give you like another night.  I think this show could be huge.  It's a...  I think it's a hit show, too.  It's going to go on Fridays.  You lose the Jewish population because Friday night's a holy night.  Yeah.  And that's my crowd, you know?  Right.  So people are real busy. 
[01:49:00]  And as the host, you make that show work.  Big time.  Well, thank you.  Points to fellow Jew and goes,  Yeah.  You set me up for a Jew joke.  You know, they're going to do a documentary about game shows if you want to be part of that.  You could do a Ken Burns effect over my ass.  One versus a hundred.  That was me here yesterday.  I found an extra two seconds of Groucho Marx footage from You Bet Your Life.  It's fantastic.  It's pixelated.  We were trying to find an extra two seconds of Jeff Ross's appearance yesterday. 
[01:49:30]  Jeff, do you want to be on One Versus 100?  They're still looking in the OA archives.  Jeff's going to go on One Versus 100, but we're not going to have time to talk to you.  You were supposed to get us on One Versus 100?  We're going to.  With the listeners.  They wouldn't let me bring in my people because we did them really fast and hit the ground  with them and did eight of them, like Hanukkah, and then they're all going on every Friday.  Another empty promise for a week.  No, no, no.  I'm good for my stuff.  That's what I see.  No, don't.  Don't.  You love the show. 
[01:50:00]  You belong there if you want to go.  I can't acknowledge the show anymore.  I'm sorry.  No, please don't let it go like that.  Too bad.  Jim, I'll put you on.  You can bring your hole.  Oh, I like that.  One Versus 100 holes.  Ken Burns had, like, I actually didn't know that there was one piece of footage.  It looked like a second and a half, but then somebody...  You know, a lot of people suffered during the Civil War.  Was it Civil War or did you go into World War II?  All of them.  All of them.  He did all of them.  Civil War, World War II.  War of the Worlds. 
[01:50:30]  He took 10 minutes on the Huey Long documentary he did in 1985.  I wanted to plot.  He's doing a musical about the War of 1812.  This guy does everything.  That's fantastic.  He was talking about wars that haven't even begun yet.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did the North Korea movie.  He's halfway through it.  He's talking about projects.  Seriously, he was plugging projects.  He's like, our next one, it'll take five years.  Yeah, Vietnam is going to take seven years to do it.  Well, it took 35 minutes to complain about yesterday.  Okay, I didn't even say, can I just answer what the Drowsy Chabron was about? 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  My producers are listening and stuff.  And it's a 1928 fake musical written by this guy, Bob Martin, who's brilliant.  And he won a Tony for the script.  I keep, people always say, nobody really gives a crap if people win stuff, if it's a great  show, right?  Yes.  So when I did the documentary on the making of the Drowsy Chabron.  But it's a guy that's like a shut-in, agoraphobic, pseudo.  Your character.  Right.  I said, how can I play a guy that's like, maybe he's gay, maybe he's not.  And, you know, he lives alone, doesn't talk to anybody, never really had sex with anybody. 
[01:51:30]  And people went, you're perfect.  Yeah.  I went, what?  And he's in a cardigan sweater again.  You were on TV doing that for years.  And I'm like Danny Tanner, but like three levels of psychosis.  It's very different than Danny Tanner.  Yeah.  It's a character.  And it's an amazing thing to play.  But he is alone in his apartment, never leaves it.  And he starts telling this audience.  He plays a long-playing LP and describes this 1928 musical that he's in love with.  And then the audience is my acting partner, really.  And he's all alone. 
[01:52:00]  And the play starts coming out of the walls.  Right.  So all the people he's talking about in this 1928 musical, it's like a drug trip, really.  But he's kind of nuts.  And it just unveils itself.  And it's kind of tongue-in-cheek.  So it kind of makes fun of itself constantly.  It's always saying, I hate this scene.  You're not going to like this.  And that makes you want to watch it.  And it's like people spitting water on each other.  Old vaudeville combined with some great, great music.  Had you ever done like, because to me, theater acting seems terrifying.  I have problems on camera.  Just acting frightens me. 
[01:52:30]  How about stage acting?  Is it horrible?  Well, I love it.  And it's a whole different muscle, you know.  It's my gay muscle, which is obviously I'm sitting on.  But I was, I did, sorry.  Squat and pick up a golf ball.  Right.  It's in between.  Suction is the whole key to this business.  But I did a play three years ago called Privilege, an off-Broadway thing.  And I was terrified at first.  And you did see that.  Sorry, I see everything you do about it.  You're my theater host.  Wait, you guys are friends, huh?  Yeah.  I'm starting to get that impression.  We went to Astro Burger drunk one night in Hollywood. 
[01:53:00]  How did that original play that you did?  You wrote all my Pam Anderson roast jokes, remember?  I did.  I came up with those.  We were so wasted.  You wrote the whole thing in five.  Did you really?  I was going to goof on him a little bit.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, no, now the time has passed.  I came up with one of your ace questions.  Did you know what I was going to?  Where was it yesterday?  He wants to know.  This is amazing.  Look at that.  Two people at the same time.  You're really coming into your own, Anthony.  I conducted a fine interview yesterday.  They just turned you into Ed McMahon yesterday. 
[01:53:30]  That's what happened.  They waited for the appropriate time for you to speak.  He's just happy that we're all paying attention to him today.  We're all looking at Jeff.  It's all about Jeff.  And he's killing.  I'm in my glory.  Stress factory tomorrow night.  Jeff Ross.  There you go.  Sit in the front.  I'll make fun of you, too.  I'll complain about your life.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Bob Saget, Drowsy Chaperone.  What was it going to say?  It's in one theater.  I was going to say theaters.  Right.  That would be impossible.  It is playing.  It's on the road with a guy named Jonathan Crombie in Philly. 
[01:54:00]  But the Marquee Theater here in Manhattan.  Yeah, yeah.  It's an amazing space.  And you can't walk around Manhattan without seeing advertising for it.  Yes.  Which is good for you.  It's a beautiful theater, too.  Is it?  It's the second biggest in the city.  Well, third biggest in the city.  I guess Wicked is in the biggest in the Radio City.  Have you seen that?  The Rockettes?  Could you give me Wicked tickets?  They stink.  I might be.  The Rockettes.  Will you come see my show first, though?  Really?  Look at him.  He's asking for tickets to another show.  I really want Wicked, Bob.  I know we're here to promote the Drowsy show.  He is being a bastard. 
[01:54:30]  Let's wheel and deal.  I need Wicked tickets.  All right.  I can help you out.  When are you coming to me?  When are you going to see Drowsy, though?  Well, when you hand me the Wicked tickets with the Drowsy Chaperone tickets.  Do you have the tickets?  Do you have the tickets?  All right.  Give me Wicked.  I'll go see your Drowsy.  Wait.  What night's a week do you do it?  I do it every day, but Monday.  We have a Tuesday night, and then Wednesday matinee, and then Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Just go to DrowsyChaperone.com for all the show dates.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  Jeff Ross at Stress Factory tomorrow night. 
[01:55:00]  Thank you, Bob.  And we still have Club Soda Kenny singing the German version of 99 Red Balloons.  It's awful.  It's got to be played before we get out of here today.  O.P. and Anthony.  Broadcast program.  Saturday Night Virus.  Black Phillip returns to the Saturday Night Virus.  This Saturday from 9 to midnight on XM202.  The Virus.  When you need to know something, call O.P. and Anthony.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  They will give it to you like it is. 
[01:55:30]  Cell phone and PDA users send your message to feedback at O.P. and Anthony.com.  Everything is happening now.  O.P. and Anthony has it for you.  Radio Shock Jog.  O.P. and Anthony.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Busy day.  We got Jeffrey Ross playing the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey tomorrow night.  And we got Bob Saget on Broadway.  The Drowsy Chaperone.  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  At the Marquee Theater here in Manhattan.  Are you there all the way through the New Year?  Yeah.  I was going to go to like February 2nd, but because we had the strike, I think I'm going  to extend a couple weeks.  Because I just love doing it.  It's an amazing thing.  You want to come see it?  I can't New Year's Eve.  I'll be in Long Island at the North Fork Theater.  I know you do.  Yeah.  That's a great place.  Yeah.  Old Westbury Music Fair.  That's New Year's Eve.  But I mean...  Right.  New Year's Eve is a great place to go to the North Fork, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's in the round, isn't it?  No.  Not when I do it.  No.  Curtain it off. 
[01:56:30]  I told the in the round story with you.  Right.  Bob Saget did that same theater, and I went to see it, and he was making fun of this older  lady in the front row, and then he wanted to do a call back to the old lady, but because  he was slowly spinning, he was pointing at some dude, like, where the hell did she go?  Yeah.  The microwave popcorn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's now behind you, but to you, it looks like the audience isn't, you know, you're  in the same spot.  I thought she turned into a man.  Right.  I wanted her either way.  You start pointing, and then you would look just very...  Where is she?  Well, yeah, that's what happens when you've had, like, a hit show and stuff. 
[01:57:00]  You do the theater in the round, but when you're languishing in mediocrity, they curtain  it off, and you do half the theater, which I kind of like better.  I think you'll be surprised in the years, if you're Jim Norton.  I think it's going to be pretty packed.  That's my guess.  You guys should have seen Jim at the Gene Simmons roast.  Yeah?  Jeff got me that, by the way.  I love Ross.  He called me, and he goes, we're roasting Gene Simmons.  You gotta come.  That's cool.  It was one of my idols.  It was amazing to roast him.  You and me both.  You were the last...  You know, when they came back, you and I drove down to Philly, and I was like, I'm not doing 
[01:57:30]  this without Jim Norton.  You had the greatest joke ever.  There's like...  The dais is like all Kiss fans, who are not necessarily the best-looking people in the  world.  It's like Carrot Top, and Danny Mataducci, and Andrew Dice Clay, and me, and you, and  Lampanelli, and Jim Norton goes, look at this place.  It looks like a...  It looks like a...  The lineup?  The lineup for...  No.  Oh, it looked like a lineup of...  The villains from...  The Dick Tracy villains, yeah. 
[01:58:00]  Squash head.  I said, look at this.  It's like the cast of VH1's The Worst Week Ever.  Yeah, it was good, man.  It was really nerve-wracking, though, man.  And Steve-O was on the dais and supposed to do something, and I didn't know he was behaving  as badly as he was, but they literally had to remove him.  But you saw him at rehearsal, smoking pot on stage.  He took his nutsack out, you know, on the red carpet.  We had...  Oh, he stapled it to the seat just so he would sit still.  He exposed himself. 
[01:58:30]  But he kept jumping up during the other roasters and like pulling his stuff, his junk out.  Yep.  And finally, we just like, we got to take this guy out of here.  He's not part of the team.  He actually honestly did this.  And I didn't know this until after.  Let's just say, we have to phrase this carefully.  He used an empty water bottle, stood up, and filled it on the dais.  Wow.  In front of an audience.  Oh, wow.  And I went over after the show to talk to Paul Rodriguez, who I didn't know, and I saw  the closed bottle under like one of the seats. 
[01:59:00]  He left it on the dais.  But what do you expect him to do, though?  But I mean, not that bad.  No, I know, but that's Steve-O's thing.  At least he didn't poo in a thermos.  Steve-O was there.  He's an animal.  Hot lunch.  He had prepared material.  He came to rehearsal.  He wanted to show a different side of himself.  Okay.  He wants to do comedy.  We all have the same agent.  I was supportive of it.  I pushed for him because I was the roast master.  And then he just mucked it up.  Can I ask the question?  Where was this story yesterday morning on the show?  Yeah, really?  I would have liked to have heard this.  We were waiting for you to bring it to life. 
[01:59:30]  We could have learned a lot yesterday.  By the way, a Bob Saget roast would be the highest rated show in history.  Yeah.  That would be one versus a hundred.  That would be great.  My father would come back from the grave to trash me.  That's a nice thing to say.  Yeah.  I remember my dad.  He would.  I had to bring that up again.  He's a good guy.  Awkward.  What do you mean?  Walk away.  Awkward for everybody.  Deceased.  Your own.  Stop.  He was a funny woman.  Let me tell you that.  Has Gene Simmons ever been on this show?  Many times.  Oh, yeah.  He has the worst personality. 
[02:00:00]  Just hawking things.  That's all he does.  He likes the ladies.  He's a very flirtatious man.  Yeah, and he talks to guys, like regular guys, like they should be living his lifestyle.  Right.  And meanwhile, he's Gene Simmons from Kiss.  He's got the money, the fame, a rock star thing.  And then he's talking to like, you know, deli clerks saying, you know, you should have  as many girlfriends as you need and, you know, you shouldn't be bogged down to one  woman.  Why would you do that to yourself? 
[02:00:30]  It's like, no, I'm a working Joe.  Sorry, I don't have eight billion dollars.  He's got a family and everything, though.  Because he's a rock star.  It's like, Gene, do you think that you'd have this if you were just a right?  He's wearing Darth Vader's helmet.  Yeah.  The thing on his head is silly.  He's very walk.  He's very disappointing when you meet him.  That's what I said.  Because he markets the hell out of himself in Kiss, which, God bless him, but it's like  boring.  I said, Gene.  And we've called him out on this, by the way.  We're not talking about his back like we did you yesterday, Jeff. 
[02:01:00]  No.  But then there's Paul Stanley.  He's a cool guy.  Oh, yeah.  You also had a great joke about Paul Stanley.  Yeah.  He said he broke his hip falling out of the closet.  Yeah.  And with Gene, while I said it, because Gene was like, and Gene looked at me and he goes,  it's not true.  I'm like, I know.  I'm just.  I know.  He doesn't like the gay jokes about Paul.  Of course not.  They're not true.  And, you know, but it is pretty.  Paul's a kid.  He does sound hilarious.  It is hilarious.  I said, Gene Simmons.  What a life.  Ninety-eight million records, 4,300 women, two friends. 
[02:01:30]  I have to tell a quick Jeff Ross story.  Sure.  The night before I opened here on the Broadway, Jeff and I and Jamie Kennedy, we did University  of Maryland.  Right.  We're in the field house, Cole Field House.  It was 5,000 people.  So, Jeff complained for a half hour and then Jamie went on and did his set and then I did  an hour.  And then, so backstage, you got your green room stuff, you know, and you have your stuff,  your agent.  And Jeff and I actually have the same agent, your fabulous Heidi Feigen. 
[02:02:00]  We love her.  And William Morris.  So, and Jamie's got his people and you have your table, you know, your accoutrements.  Jamie's got Subway sandwiches made of vegetables.  He's got all kinds of like cute little Nutri-Grain bars and a coffee thing and tea and other candies  that he likes and milk duds, all these weird, wonderful things for, I don't know, maybe he  lures people back and gives it to them.  He doesn't eat them.  And then, and soup, he's got like soup.  He's got on the thing.  I've got like a bunch of stuff.  I like my little, whatever, I don't know, salads or whatever.  Sure.  Fruity stuff. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, your girlfriend went, you had plenty of food and refreshments.  Right, right.  You look at Jeff's table.  I'm not kidding you.  A round plate with chopped up vegetables on it.  It's just like a six inch pie pan.  From 7-Eleven.  Garbage.  Just garbage.  The table took pictures of it.  It was pathetic.  They treated me like a rabbit.  He was sitting there alone.  I said, put it in your rider.  He doesn't know what, and he's complaining about it, of course.  Look at your table.  Look what I got.  I got nothing.  I'm new at this.  I'm a behind the scenes guy.  You've been doing this for 20 years?  I've never ordered vegetables before. 
[02:03:00]  You know, I've been on the road lately.  I'm learning.  I'm learning from you, buddy.  You're a powerful comedian.  The table full of goodies like everyone else.  My rider, I have certain things I might need, like Alka-Seltzer.  I don't have anything crazy on it, though.  Kenny, do I?  No.  You have Imodium on it?  You're crazy enough.  Alka-Seltzer is a little crazy.  Not if you feel nauseous.  I need Alka-Seltzer.  You might get nauseous before a show.  Sometimes you eat something, you've got to settle your stomach right before you go on.  That's the only way to do it.  I've taken Imodium before I go on, because I was just, you know.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Is it in your rider, or do you just personally have it with you?  It goes through my stomach and out my colon.  What do you mean?  I guess it's a rider for what comes out.  It's kind of a sleigh ride.  I remember in Guantanamo Bay, we were about to go on, me and Jim Norton.  And he's about to go on.  The warm-up act is on.  And Jim is demanding to be driven back to the barracks to get an Alka-Seltzer.  Was I really?  It was like a 40-minute drive back across Guantanamo Bay.  Oh.  I guess my stomach was unguzzling.  On taxpayers' money.  This guy's being tortured like 200 yards away using an Alka-Seltzer. 
[02:04:00]  This guy's in real pain.  Jim, oh, my tummy hurts.  Some guy getting a truncheon to the bottom of his feet.  Are you filming all this?  Do you have footage of him?  I did shoot it, yeah.  I do have it.  Because you're a documentary filmmaker.  Yes.  More people don't ask you about that.  No, not enough questions about your documentary.  I think my documentary's better than his.  Wow.  I love this side of Bob Saget.  He knows how to poke.  I'm very impressed.  I like this, Bob.  Well, I like... 
[02:04:30]  More poking.  The Jew comedian is very easy to prod.  Yeah.  Hey, you're not a fan of TMZ, you were telling me?  Well, they came up to me, which is all good.  I don't really...  You know, if people want to film you, it means they give a crap.  Right.  So people complain.  When people complain, sometimes you don't know where it's coming from.  Am I right, Jeff?  That's right.  Bob, when you walk out of a restaurant or a club or something, you're happy when you  see people there to shoot you, right?  Right.  I don't understand the celebrities that are like, oh, God, leave me alone.  Get away.  Yeah, I don't either.  When Brittany did her MTV extravaganza and her lip sync, loop sync, and then I come out 
[02:05:00]  and TMZ was standing there and he goes, hey, what do you think of Brittany?  And I was out of the Ivy in L.A., you know, that fabulous meatloaf restaurant.  And they go, what do you think of her?  I said, I don't really talk about people.  And he goes, oh, so really?  So what about the Olsen twins?  I'm like, hey, dude, how's your mother?  I'm looking into the camera.  And he goes, what?  What?  Wait.  I said, how's your grandmother?  How's she doing?  She doesn't call me.  You know, I don't hear from her.  And then my car pulls up.  He goes, what did you get that with full house money? 
[02:05:30]  I said, yeah.  And I took your grandmother for a spin.  I'm just like zooming on his mom and his grandma.  Bob Saget will.  Didn't end up on a TMZ.  You're very protective of the Olsen twins.  I love them.  I noticed that about you.  Have you read about their dating habits?  I was actually, it was in the thing.  I was out when supposedly all that dating stuff.  Anthony Hopkins, right?  Wasn't it Anthony Hopkins?  Well, no.  Mary Kate did a movie with Anthony Hopkins.  So they did a, they have a kiss scene in it. 
[02:06:00]  Wow.  No, not Anthony Hopkins.  Ben Kingsley.  I'm sorry.  Ben Kingsley.  I have a one scene with Anthony Hopkins.  Yeah, yeah.  You get to kiss.  But then Hannibal Lecter's me in the lower area.  And they were claiming they were actually dating.  I don't know about that.  That I actually do not know.  That's the other thing.  I'm protective because I don't really know that stuff.  But I'll go out and see them.  They came to my show already.  Hey, could you get them in here?  If we were very respected, we promised to be nice.  You could be here.  Seriously.  I don't.  You can ask them.  They would be very nice to them.  I will ask them.  They do love you.  I've seen them around you.  I love them.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, they're like, you know, they were nine months old. 
[02:06:30]  And now they're billionaires.  That is interesting.  You want to come in that day, Jeff?  Do you think they might have more money than you?  I was just going to ask that, dude.  Actually, honestly, God, do you think they have more cash than you do?  Of course.  Oh, I would.  Way more.  I didn't sell them.  No, I'm serious.  Way more.  They're an industry.  They're legendary.  But I wouldn't compare my money to anyone's but Jeff right now.  But no.  Why?  You didn't make little detective movies.  I did, but I only made one.  And I did it.  I just showed it to my friends.  You couldn't solve the case.  I was in a raincoat, and I had a lunchbox with my face on it. 
[02:07:00]  Jimmy, Bob said it.  They're an industry.  They're an industry.  And you know what?  It happened.  They have a clothing line.  They got just everything.  And they're good at it.  They're very, very smart girls.  I love them a lot.  I've been actually talking to all of the Full House cast members.  We've been emailing each other.  I don't think the Brady's email each other.  Except, like, please stay away.  How much does he weigh today?  That was the last email they sent.  It is kind of crazy. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, that's just not good.  Obviously, when you see Saget on Broadway, you know.  Wow.  What was that?  I missed the last one.  Just awful.  Where should I send the wreath?  Oh.  It's just awful.  It's a story.  Yeah.  That's not good.  There was another story going on there.  You can't finish any of these things.  You can't start these subjects.  Hey, Tom wants to say hi to you, Bob.  Cool.  Tom from White Plains.  Tom.  Hey.  Hi.  Hello.  I noticed Jeffrey was in the middle of a story and was just cut off. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, really?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm noticing now today.  We don't want to do this two days in a row.  I'm noticing now today.  I'm very attentive to you.  Tom, we'll get to you in a second.  It's not important.  But the point I was making was that you see Bob Saget in Broadway.  It's one thing.  You see him on the TV shows.  It's another thing.  It's a pretty amazing difference.  You see him at a college or live on stage with college kids wearing like Full House and  Danny Tanner t-shirts with five million people screaming.  It's something that you'll never see an equivalent in show business.  I did it with these guys.  These guys helped me do it with their Opie and Anthony tour. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That was great.  I sowed new seeds and eggs.  Girls lift their shirts.  Men lift their shirts.  Show me their boobs.  People really show up to your shows, though, with Full House shirts.  Me and a bouffant hairdo on their shirt.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Just vomit.  Do they know you're dirty, though?  Honestly?  Yeah.  Now they probably do.  It's starting to get out there, right?  Yeah, it's out.  So they come and bring their children.  By the way, congrats on Forest of the Penguins.  Thank you.  It's doing like crazy amazing. 
[02:09:00]  It's a mockery of March of the Penguins.  Are you in that, Joe?  Yeah, I'm in it for a couple minutes.  It's hilarious, man.  It's very funny.  Thank you.  It's on iTunes now.  It's a good stoner film.  Thank you.  Because I was not stoned when I made it.  Because you can't really be stoned when you make this crap.  But Sam Jackson narrated it.  And I should have had you guys in it.  Yeah.  I directed the thing.  I do good voices.  You're hilarious.  I screwed up.  I'll do it next time.  Do a voice.  That's hilarious.  Sounds like a penguin. 
[02:09:30]  Exactly.  Do it again.  I love it.  All right.  Let's go back to Tom in White Plains.  This is Tom from Is Tom Alive, by the way.  Get out of here.  I thought you were dead, Tom.  No, no.  I wasn't feeling too well, Friday.  But besides that, the Philly show.  I met you, Bob.  And it was really nice meeting you.  You too.  I'm a big fan of yours. 
[02:10:00]  And Jimmy, I...  Hold on, Tom.  I'm watching Austin Powers.  Oh, no, wait.  That's Liza Minnelli.  All right.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Don't tell me she's singing New York, New York again.  That stupid fat Botox face.  Can you stop with Botox?  Just look old.  I thought it was Ken Burns.  She does look like Ken Burns.  She's singing Old York, Old York.  A Yorkie just dropped out of her pants leg.  How old is she?  105 in the freeway.  She's going to set it back. 
[02:10:30]  She looks terrible.  She looks like David...  She looks like Vincent Minnelli.  What was her ex-husband's name?  David Gass.  It was David Gass.  That's so mean.  We should stop this.  No, we shouldn't.  She should just age gracefully instead of having her face blown up with air.  She looks horrible.  Just drink like your mother.  She looks like Mario Cantone.  Jesus, enough already.  Jesus, Anthony.  That was the meanest of all the things that were said.  I feel better.  I was trying to top it.  It was truthful.  And just end with pure evil.  That was the bit closer.  Yes.  There's no place like home.  By the way, Tom, if you can't figure it out, no one really cares. 
[02:11:00]  No, go ahead, Tom.  I apologize.  I'm sorry, Tom.  I apologize, Tom.  No disrespect.  We just used up like 30% of his life.  Yeah.  What's up, Tom?  I just want to say hi to Bob, Jeff, and Jimmy.  I got a great picture of you and myself.  It can't be a great picture if you're in it.  Do a slow pan over it.  I remember meeting you, and I got SARS that night when I shook your hand.  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:30]  Is that mean?  The guy's got six months to a year long.  No, that's not true.  Oh, yeah.  He's pretty much done.  We get a call from him every week to see if he's still alive.  Tom, I didn't know.  Tom.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  I just said that I shook your hand and got something.  I feel terrible.  You should.  You probably really did.  You're not catchable, are you?  Why is Bob on TV and here?  That's kind of creepy.  Oh, that is creepy.  By the way, we're watching Bob promote Drowsy Chaperone on TV. 
[02:12:00]  Look at you on TV.  Bob, look how nice you look.  Yeah, I know.  What happened?  They cleaned me up so the daughters trust me.  Who'd you bring with you, Bob?  Bob, who'd you bring with you?  You didn't introduce your friend.  Oh, that's my buddy, Mikey.  He seems bored.  What does Mikey do?  Mikey, all right?  He does.  We tool around.  Look at the guy that beat up Linderman in My Bodyguard.  No, that's not possible.  Nothing on that one?  No.  Oh, damn it.  That was conflicting that I was on television just now.  Moody's bike.  Moody's bike.  All right.  Hey, Tom, are you still alive? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, good.  Is there a chance that you can pull through this, buddy?  No.  Not right now.  I'd like to believe in the positive that you are going to make it through this.  He's definitely going to die.  You're going to have...  No.  We're all definitely going to die.  You want to give him a lung?  That would help.  I'd give you a lung.  Can you do with an animal's lung?  Like a sheep or a lamb or a goat?  A goat's lung?  That's good.  All right.  Oh, I feel so bad right now.  I love it.  But not bad enough to not promote the drowsy chaperone. 
[02:13:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  What's the theater on Broadway?  It's the Marquis Theater at the Marriott Marquis at, you know, Broadway and 45th.  Great show.  Bob Saget, of course.  Go out and support that here in New York for the holidays.  Thank you, Jeff.  Jeff Ross.  Thank you, Jim.  Tomorrow night at the Stress Factory in New Jersey.  This weekend at the Improv in Irvine.  Well, Stress Factory in Jersey, you have a better...  Because this is his first Jersey show in 10 years.  So go out and see him.  And then Improv in Irvine if you're in California.  Thank you, brother.  Or if you want to go to both of you, you're a big Jeff Ross fan.  And my stupid New Year's Eve show at North Fork, we're not going to talk about it until tomorrow. 
[02:13:30]  No, it's going to be sold out.  It's irrelevant.  I think they should fill it, go 360 with it.  That's what I'm telling everybody listening.  He's nobody funnier than Jim Norton.  Why would people on Pal Talk call Jeffrey Ross' show the drowsy audience?  Oh, that's not true.  Come sit in the front and see what happens.  It's a bit of venom.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Fat-faced little short Liza.  Look at her.  Wow, how short is she?  Tiny little thing.  She's just a little thing?  Is Jeff on the show tomorrow?  What show? 
[02:14:00]  Jeff, that's your show.  Is he on the show?  This was the make good.  Can I just say, this was so much fun.  I'm so glad you pissed me off yesterday because today was so fun.  Liza's tiny.  All right.  With a big head.  You want to acknowledge that Jeff Ross said something to me?  Yeah, of course.  Blow him off at the very end.  I just can't stop looking at that fat face Liza.  At that tiny little thing.  Little tiny with a big, wide, fat, punchable face.  Hey, we're off to XM.  Have a good day.  Yes.  Bob Sag, Jeff Ross.  Thank you so much. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you.  Happy Holidays.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  The virus.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.

[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  I was looking at the front cover, which Bob interestingly pointed out, they put little 
[02:18:30]  stars over her nipples and the front cover.  But then you turn over the case and on the back is Amy Fisher sucking a giant cock, a big  bent one, and then another big bent one inside her.  You thought that was a giant cock?  Well, it kind of looks, from the look of her sucking it, I guess I don't know how much is  in her mouth.  I was trying to make a, I have a big cock joke, but...  Oh, it opens up. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, it opens up, but it fell flat.  Yeah, yeah.  It fell flat.  She don't look too bad.  What is this exactly?  She made it on purpose?  It looks like it.  She's saying that someone got the tape, you know, that old gag, but...  No, it's got too much footage in it.  Yeah, just how it's shot.  It looks like they really thought this out ahead of time.  There's close-ups and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's put this on our DVD.  Oh, pop that right in and kick it over.  This is XM Satellite Radio.  Take a little look.  She's really sexy, man.  You want my copy?  Do you know what always disturbs me is the glossiness of the outside of these DVD cases. 
[02:19:30]  There's something that makes me feel like there's goo on it.  That sometimes...  It's made as a laminate.  It's made to wipe off with a washcloth.  So you don't have...  It really feels like someone already came on it.  Your jizz hands.  That's what I'm thinking.  Getting all over it.  Well, this is obviously...  I mean, she's posing.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I'm a little confused.  It looks like they decided to make a sex tape and then make believe it was stolen or something.  Holy mackerel. 
[02:20:00]  She's really doing it here.  That is a holy mackerel.  It certainly is.  It's a red snapper.  Saget, you're in your element now.  Yeah, I feel very comfortable.  She's the snatch of the day.  Can we do a bunch of pussy fish metaphors?  Yeah.  Are we allowed?  You could just go right for it.  Could she get her boobs done?  Yeah.  Yep.  I'll just take my dick right in her bass.  I fucked her for the hell of it.  Nothing. 
[02:20:30]  Right?  None of it matters.  A nice boob job Amy Fisher has here.  Yeah.  She actually looks good.  I mean, she looks...  She looks very good.  We were quiet for a while, so we're looking at it.  So how old is she now?  Let's see.  When did that happen?  This was 15 years ago, right?  92-ish?  92.  The one who invited her to your show tomorrow?  She was underage, so now she's about 30 or something?  She's probably about 30...  I would guess 32.  I'm going to go with 32 on the Amy Fisher.  At least she did something with her life. 
[02:21:00]  Look at the old Joey Buttafuco lookalike, licking her snatch.  Her last name has the word fish in it.  Have you noticed?  Yes.  Why can't we get the DVD playing?  That's why we're kind of sitting here waiting.  What's going on?  It's moving.  I've never seen such a beautiful studio, by the way.  You guys are...  It's gorgeous.  Yeah, they like to take care of us over here.  So the stuff doesn't work, but it looks great.  Yeah.  As long as it looks good.  Mars, we've got to look...  I like the round table.  You could never possibly ignore anyone in this room. 
[02:21:30]  You know, you're absolutely right, Jeff.  They'd have to be sitting under the table for you not to see them.  Ken Burns should do a documentary about this studio.  Well, he could do a slow pan, right?  Yeah.  Across the whole studio.  He actually shot that Amy Fisher video.  Ah, yes.  It says Ken Burns.  It took him 15 years.  He gave the Ken Burns look to her pussy.  Well, anyway, this is fun.  It was a fish pan.  A knish pan.  No, we're just waiting for the video to start, Jeff. 
[02:22:00]  Anyone have an iPhone charger with them?  Boy, this is riveting.  iPhone charger.  The DVD doesn't work.  Anyone have an iPhone charger?  My phone's about to die.  I don't have the charger.  Your phone, it's dying.  I had to replace mine.  I took it to the store, the Apple store, 24 hours.  I went there like four in the morning, drunk, and they replaced it.  Really?  They're open all night?  Yeah, and they're all drunk.  We were talking about how great Apple is.  They just know how to do business.  Genius bar.  And it has the word bar in it, so I'll go there.  Yeah.  Don't you feel like you should belly up to it and get a drink? 
[02:22:30]  They should have booze in there.  Yeah.  Some kind of elixir.  They have a DJ at like 11 at night.  There's a guy that spins records.  Seriously.  Just booze.  That's all they need.  Yeah, I know.  I play with this thing all day long.  It's replaced my dick.  Oh, boy.  Ah, the iPhone.  That's wonderful.  They should have people blow you in the Apple store.  It...  Let me see.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Who is that? 
[02:23:00]  Ah, just...  Just a guy.  All right.  I won't worry about it.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  All right, where were we?  Lars, what happened?  Let me see.  You don't know?  I've got to get a fun camera angle.  I think camera five.  What are we doing?  That's what I'm going to pick.  Oh, so they're playing the DVD.  You know, you can't just hand us the Amy Fisher sex tape and then...  Expect us to...  Just do a regular radio show.  We've got to take a look at this.  But we're on the air now, correct?  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Believe it or not.  I just want to be clear on this.  Believe it or not.  So people are listening to the...  Believe it or not.  I don't think that's...  A relaxed moment.  I don't think that's ever good when the host...  The host...  One of the guests have to ask, are we on the air?  It's like, we're on the air.  You're actually putting this over as a show.  I've been trying to do a lot of vagina fish Amy Fisher stuff.  Yeah.  And then the dead air cut me off.  Well, we have Joe Francis calling in today, too, which is in the same theme.  Oh, wow.  He's in jail still, right?  Yeah.  He's calling from jail.  This is his one call.  He calls here.  I guess so.  I don't know how he's going to swing that. 
[02:24:00]  Criminals love us.  They love calling from jail.  They love calling us from jail.  He's got all kinds of allegations of abuse in jail.  He's been abused.  By the guards.  All right.  We got the Amy Fisher.  Here we go.  All right.  Where?  Now push your ass in my face and let me tongue fuck you.  You can't get out with my tongue before you lie.  That's not her.  That's from Wicked.  That's not her.  Let me tongue fuck you, baby.  Roll over, damn it. 
[02:24:30]  Not on your life, baby.  You left out the best part.  Put your tongue up, my asshole, and start licking.  This is the audio porno.  This is stuff that used to come out in the 70s.  And he's cutting up a whole new version, but this is like the greatest hits.  You would buy it on an 8-track, and then I guess in your big console at home or in the  car, you'd pop this in and listen to porno.  There's no visual here.  And they're acting, and it's so bad. 
[02:25:00]  And the woman's like, let me see your cock.  She's just horrid.  Bad acting.  It's Canterbury Tales porn.  Yeah.  Bite me.  Fuck me, baby.  Fuck me.  Bite me and fuck me.  Put your hands under my ass and shove your cock up into my belly.  Oh, baby.  You big baby.  That was a chaperone at the theater. 
[02:25:30]  Like, what the fuck is that?  Is Bob allowed to be here?  Probably not.  I'm in a family show, right?  That's what they did, man.  Probably should get the fucking out.  They sound like a family.  They sound like a mother and her son.  Hey, baby.  This is heaven.  Love her.  Oh, you sure as hell are a born coxman.  Oh, I love it this way.  A born coxman.  What do you think?  I think the bleachers aren't full for a reason.  Yeah, people get off on this.  Bad idea or they don't?  It's such bad acting, though.  It is so bad. 
[02:26:00]  I disagree.  I think it's hot.  There is nothing hot about it.  Yeah, it's good.  It's believable dialogue.  The dialogue's believable, but the acting is over the top.  You're such a douche.  You're a born coxman.  Coxman.  I like that.  That's the inflection I like to hear him think.  It's like a woodsman.  Kill, you fucking whore.  I like that.  That's good.  That's a nice greeting.  Trystale from the Beverly Hillbillies.  Jethro, you fucking whore.  Trystale.  Bill, yes, your story made me a little horny, you know? 
[02:26:30]  I got a hard one.  Yes, Doctor.  No.  The hack, psych voice.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the psychiatrist.  He's probably the producer of this whole thing.  Yeah.  And he's all like, well, let me see.  Do you have a problem with this?  What?  It's a cartoon.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I feel that picture.  It was all the way up.  Oh, babe.  I think it's coming out my asshole.  I think I'm coming. 
[02:27:00]  She thinks it's...  How did she not know where it is?  Yeah, if you think it's coming out your asshole, it's not.  Maybe she's not sure which hole is which.  She's sucking a dick on the cover of this thing.  Let go of my ears.  Fuck you, cunt.  I'm going to come down your throat.  Why is she talking?  He's all in there.  Yeah, fuck you, cunt.  Hey, hey.  She's a man, Joe.  And you better damn well swallow it, see?  I love his sexy way of putting it.  Fuck you, cunt.  Fuck you, cunt, see?  I'm a cunt, see? 
[02:27:30]  Meh.  The frog.  Danny's working on a new episode.  This is just like quick clips.  This is my favorite one, I think, out of all the greatest hits here.  What the hell is going on?  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Well, dumb dumb.  Well.  Most indubitably.  Those two Warner Brothers chipmunks.  After you.  No, after you.  I'll come first.  Or the other guy.  Well, Mr. McGillicuddy. 
[02:28:00]  It was all supposed to be the great Gildersleeve, the Jack Benny's guy.  Yeah, yeah.  You again.  Well.  He was on the Flintstones all the time.  Yeah, but it was taken from the Jack Benny show.  It was one thing on there once where he went, you remember the Jack Benny show?  No.  You do, right?  No, no.  Oh.  He goes, this is Jack Benny.  I don't do a good impression.  He goes, this is a one-way ticket.  I asked for a round trip.  He goes, you can't blame me for trying.  He wants him out of town so bad.  Oh, he's so nasty. 
[02:28:30]  He will.  I remember when they used a voice on the Flintstones.  Fred brought back the bowling ball.  And he goes, well, yeah, my fingers don't fit in it.  And he goes, perhaps if you'd watched them.  I was always just an obnoxious fuck.  I was full of the top, officious.  So funny.  You can't blame me for trying.  Trying.  It's great.  All that stuff on the Jack Benny show, all of the lines were the jokes.  And he was just setting them up.  Yeah.  And reacting.  He was the setup, you mean?  Yeah.  That's what I love.  It was just so good. 
[02:29:00]  In Rochester, it was all, he gave them all the jokes.  Jeff, you saw that stuff, right?  I've seen clips.  Documentaries.  I think we're made.  I saw a documentary about it.  Have you ever filmed yourself having sex with someone, Jeff?  He parts of me and all of them, but not my, like, you don't see me like walking out of  a bathtub like this.  But you're saying you've done like, you've.  I love videotaping girls and taking pictures.  It's so fun.  With their knowledge or no?  Of course.  Oh, God, boo.  No, I would never.  I would never do it the other way.  What are you, a rookie?  Hidden camera?  I made a Viewmaster once out of a girl. 
[02:29:30]  Remember Viewmaster, how cool they were?  3D?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're like, what kind of scenes do they have in Viewmaster?  Because I can remember looking at them.  A lot of the Disney stuff.  Scooby-Doo.  Do they have some Superman superhero ones?  Yeah.  They were fucking cool.  And it was 3D.  I guess we're not going to see the Amy Fisher side.  I have a tape of Bob Saget and Joanne Worley.  No, the VCR.  The DVD players being brought in.  Yeah, we're working on it.  All right, we're working on it.  That's cool.  He's pretending it's laughing and he's sticking his face in a box.  Here's another clip from the best of the 8-track corner so far. 
[02:30:00]  Gee, my lollipop is all gone.  Would you like something else to suck on, I mean?  Oh, sure.  Do you have another lollipop, Doctor?  Well, not a lollipop, but I got a...  At least the doctor is believable.  Yes. 
[02:30:30]  My favorite part is probably,  Veldecession is over.  Yeah.  Velde.  She's like, do you have a lollipop?  He's like, well, I have a...  I just can't think of it.  Right.  Amy Fisher caught on tape.  So someone broke into her house, set up lights.  Shoved a cock in her mouth.  Brought in a whole film crew.  She's like...  Her and Buttafuco should have made a fuck tape.  That would have sold a lot.  Yeah.  That would have been massive.  So you liked it, did you, huh? 
[02:31:00]  Baby, you're a real fucking prick-hound.  A prick-what?  A prick-hound?  A prick-hound.  You're going to bury his dick when they're done.  Yeah.  Wait.  Let me stick my tongue up your pussy so I can remember the taste.  He's got good recall.  Remember the taste.  I can remember the taste of a pussy in a second.  I remember it was 68.  I was in Da Nang.  You haven't watched this pussy since 1974.  He remembers every pussy. 
[02:31:30]  You want to smell a pussy, you rub your tie against it, then you just keep wafting it up to your nose for the rest of the day.  Tie?  Yeah.  What the hell are you, Darren Stevens?  Oh, honey.  She was right.  It's beautiful.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Oh, poor guy.  If only we've done that line better.  Stop talking.  Stop sucking.  Stop sucking and start sucking.  Was that a clip from March of the Parse of the Parse of the Parse of the Parse of the Parse?  Rachel, you've come back. 
[02:32:00]  This one is pretty brutal.  Exit stage left even.  It's just horrible.  Snaggle puss.  Where's the new one?  Danny's working on it.  Oh.  He's cutting it up.  But he finally admitted that you had fucked and sucked him earlier during his lunch break.  Now I'm sitting here with a banana up, my hungry cunt.  I remember I went to a theater with two guys I was on the road with, Jeff DeHart and Fred Raker, on the Comedy Store College Tour, and we were in Pittsburgh, and we got a bottle of booze under a bridge and went to a porn theater. 
[02:32:30]  This is 25 years ago.  So, walked in, there's four people in the theater and us, and they're in Raincoast whacking it, and we're just sitting there, and they have the coming attractions that I had never seen.  I had never been in a movie theater to watch porno.  I don't even think there was a VHS.  I don't know what the fuck it was a million years ago.  And they start the thing, and the guy goes, you've never seen such great acting.  You've never seen so many beautiful people.  You've never seen so much fucking sucking. 
[02:33:00]  It was like the perfect announcer moment, and this woman was like rubbing a cock all over her face in a circular motion.  And I remember my friend Fred was like, oh my god, I gotta get out of here.  But we watched the feature.  Of course.  What's wrong with Fred?  Can we find old...  No, he's a good guy.  We gotta find those...  He's a downer.  He's a decent human being.  We gotta find the old porn trailers.  We got any?  Yeah, those would be great.  Let's see if RedTube or YouTube, one of those have those.  I've only been in a couple of live theaters.  It was just too creepy.  I was in one in Bayshore. 
[02:33:30]  The internet.  I just went to cheer my friends on, you know, because they were working.  Mom, are you done?  Also, DVDs, VHS tapes.  Yep.  Kind of ended that.  Why are you gonna go there when you can pop a tape in?  It's crazy.  Jack it, pop it back out.  It sounds creepy to say you were in a theater, but we did the same thing in high school.  Drank a few beers and piled into...  You'd always go out with a bunch of friends or something.  That's the only way you could see porn back then.  Yep.  The guys that went alone were really creepy.  But if you go out with a bunch of your friends, you were just laughing at everything. 
[02:34:00]  Why the raincoat, though?  Why does it have to be a raincoat?  Yeah, because it's easy access, I guess.  Probably got a hole in the pocket.  So Giuliani gets credit for cleaning up Times Square, but it also is a factor of the times.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah, people...  You got it wrong.  You're not gonna give me a blowjob.  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  Ah, there's a difference, you know.  Semantics.  Oh, deal or no deal?  Oh, damn, lover, I'm coming! 
[02:34:30]  Okay, that's it, pussy.  Get the cloth and wash me off.  I gotta get going.  Dice.  Send him like an inus.  Get the cloth.  Get the cloth.  The cloth.  I'll say you're done.  Get a mop.  All right, one more.  Don't worry, I'll be around again sniffing your pussy.  Next time I'll eat your asshole out until your nose bleeds.  Now you've got me wondering what it would be like to whack my dick off in a bitch's face.  House ghostly.  Oh, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho.  House Samantha. 
[02:35:00]  It sounds like Barry Katz, actually.  Oh, my God.  An excited Barry Katz.  Lick your pussy.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Tell your nose bleeds.  One more real fast.  What are you going to ask, Scott?  What about the cheeks of my ass?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, honey.  Oh, that's great.  Now, lick my sweaty balls.  I could listen to that more.  Oh, I know.  It was just such a great romantic tape.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  We're going to get a...  I'm confused.  I thought Drowsy Chaperone was a musical.  That is not from the Drowsy Chaperone.  Listen, we've got lots going on.  We'll have brand new audio.  Brand new 8-track porn audio.  But first, we've got to say hi to Joe Francis.  He's in the joint.  Oh.  Joe from Girls Gone Wild.  Joe.  Yo.  There he is.  The founder of Girls Gone Wild.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  I got my attorney, Dave Houston, on the phone with us, too.  Ah, just in case.  You always got to keep the attorney there.  Now, I've been reading about some allegations being made of abuse in jail. 
[02:36:00]  Can you talk about that?  Well, yeah.  Well, I mean, first of all, I'm calling you from jail.  I've been in jail for eight months.  Eight months.  And that's not because I'm convicted of a crime, but because I've been denied bail by  a small little Florida town who is intent on getting even with me.  Wow.  Denied bail.  There are people that kill people, and they get to go out on bail.  Let's put it this way.  In the same jail in Florida where I was held in Panama City, where I was denied bail, this 
[02:36:30]  guy Herman Harmon, who was one sellover for me because they decided that I should be  housed with the murderers.  He shot a guy in the head with a .38.  He was facing the death penalty.  He escaped from the cell.  He took a guard hostage.  He escaped from the jail.  And then the next day, they gave him an $85,000 bail, and he got out.  Why does someone have such a hard-on for you that they want to just, they're just obviously 
[02:37:00]  trying to ruin you?  Why?  I mean, you know, they claim to be zealots.  This call is subject to monitoring and recording.  Yeah.  There's a little gem there.  It's from our side.  But they claim to be zealots.  And, you know, it's definitely not a moral town.  Panama City, Florida is not a moral town.  I mean, there's nine strip clubs and 25 adult sex shops in a town of 7,000 people.  So, you know, they've claimed to have taken a moral stance against me and Girls Gone Wild.  But it really started in 2003 when I sued these guys, when they told me I couldn't come 
[02:37:30]  film Girls Gone Wild on spring break.  And I sued, you know, the mayor.  I sued the sheriff.  I sued the police.  Oh, yeah, that might have done it.  That might have done it.  But here's the worst part is I won.  And I sued them in federal court in Tallahassee.  And I said, I'm coming anyways.  Now, two weeks after I was successful and I beat these guys, they charged me with 71 felonies,  totaling 335 years in prison. 
[02:38:00]  And, I mean, I've never, guys, I've had a traffic ticket.  That's my run-in with the law of my entire life.  And then they seized my plane.  They sent out a press release saying a quantity of cocaine had been found aboard Joe Francis'  plane.  This was in 2003.  All total BS.  Total made up, fabricated.  That's since come out.  It came out, you know, later.  I got the plane back.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  And they admitted to lying.  The police officer, this guy Richard Bagwell, said I made it up.  Wow. 
[02:38:30]  And, I mean, nothing happened to him.  Now I'm in a lawsuit.  I've been in a lawsuit with the sheriff's department for four years now.  And made up the charges against me.  Admitted lying.  Okay.  So they dropped 67 of the 71 felonies.  Still cost me about $20 million in legal fees, you know, to fight these guys.  Well, you've sold a lot of tapes and DVDs.  I mean, you know, but this is, guys, it's like, now I'm sitting in jail and you know how  I got here?  Yeah, how? 
[02:39:00]  Same town.  Same people.  The judge put me in jail on a civil lawsuit.  The judge told me to settle or go to jail.  Now, this doesn't happen.  This is in the United States.  You know, I wanted to go to trial.  And I said I had the right to trial.  He told me to shut up.  And he said that I no longer have the right to trial.  He took that away from me.  And the guy who was representing the people suing me was his ex-law partner and the guy's  best friend for 35 years.  And the guy who gave the speech when the judge got confirmed. 
[02:39:30]  I mean, this is just a mess.  And I've been in jail for eight months, guys, without bail, because this guy put me in jail  from a civil lawsuit.  Didn't at one point, though, you actually made a deal to settle and cop a plea?  And then at the last minute, you decided not to?  No, we never.  Guys, I was in a meeting.  Okay, and that's a really good question, because it needs to be clarified.  I was in a mediation, a confidential mediation at the Marriott Hotel with lawyers. 
[02:40:00]  You know, a court-ordered mediation.  I had to be there.  I mediated with these guys for five days.  And they wanted $70 million, and they wouldn't come off that number.  This call is subject to monitoring and recording.  Why am I going to pay money when I know I'm going to win a trial?  I told the lawyers I was going to bury them.  Okay, and then they went back to the judge, and they said, well, he's threatening violence.  He told us that he's going to bury us.  Oh, brother.  You know, it's just ridiculous.  It was a confidential mediation.  They never should have taken anything out of that.  And they involved the judge into it. 
[02:40:30]  Guys, I've been in jail since April because of this.  What exactly do they say they're holding you on?  Are they content?  And there's another great question, because there is still no legal basis for putting me in jail  for not settling a civil lawsuit.  The judge has still not given a legal basis for it, period.  Now, the reason why they're holding me is upon entering the jail when I surrendered to an illegal order,  I had my own prescription cholesterol pills and Lunesta, which is a non-narcotic sleep aid, 
[02:41:00]  which I lawfully possessed, and cash.  They, meaning the same officer who charged me with 71 felonies four years before, charged me walking into the jail  with two felony introduction of contraband to a detention facility charges  and refused the judge to give me a bail hearing on that  and have been holding me on these ridiculous charges without bail ever since April.  So, that's why this is absurd. 
[02:41:30]  So, what are you doing there to bide your time?  Ken Burns documentary?  You know, talking to reporters on the phone.  You know, it's awful, man.  And, you know, right now, I've set up this website, meetjoefrancis.com.  And, you know, I'm trying to get people to go there, and there's a button called Help Now.  And I'm trying to get the governor to open an investigation into these guys,  because it's just, it's gone too far.  Is it true that...  This is Dave Houston.  We actually went public with this, because for four years, Joe maintained silence. 
[02:42:00]  We had the law enforcement authorities in Panama City, Florida, issuing false press releases.  They admitted they were false, but then wouldn't take them down for a year.  This call is subject to monitoring and recording.  Shut the fuck up.  We were able to get Joe transferred into the federal system because of this tax indictment.  Once we got him into the federal system, within one hour, a federal judge reviewed everything, 
[02:42:30]  including the Florida cases, and made a decision he should be out on bail.  We got him bail.  Within 24 hours, the Florida state court revoked his bail in this 2003 case,  and then the 2007 case involving his prescription medication,  the judge made a decision that she wasn't even going to grant bail in that case.  And when he told you the story of Herman Harmon, that occurred at the same time she made the decision that Joe  shouldn't get bailed because he possessed his own prescription medication. 
[02:43:00]  So we've definitely got a fight on our hands.  Well, is that because she was a woman?  You think she was more uptight about the girls gone wild?  I think it's because, guys, it's a small town.  There's kind of a good old boy network.  You know, they're all in on it.  They're all corrupt.  I mean, look, it even gets worse.  This guy, Steve Meadows.  I don't know.  Are you guys familiar with this boot camp case where they killed this 14-year-old kid?  Yeah.  Same place.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, they have videotape.  And the same state attorney who covered it up, and then he went out, and then he called, 
[02:43:30]  you know, and then the governor tried to fire him.  The same guy that's prosecuting me was the guy who called Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden,  and Jesse Jackson, Jesse James, and then for some reason didn't have nine months of email  and covered up the boot camp killing.  I don't know.  I mean, that's a long story.  But now what this guy has done to me is he, you know, has shown that this tape of child  pornography that he alleges of these 17-year-old girls that stemmed, that was the whole foundation 
[02:44:00]  of a 2003 case that a cameraman shot who wasn't directly working for Girls Gone Wild, and  he showed it to Martin Brashear, which this guy alleged was child pornography.  So the guy's, like, committing felonies now trying to prosecute me.  When Martin Brashear went down to do the interview for Nightline, he didn't, well, let's put it  this way.  Steve Meadows didn't do well on the interview.  And at the close of his interview, he takes Martin Brashear and his production crew back  and then shows him this piece of film that he calls child pornography. 
[02:44:30]  The reason I say that is because we have not seen it.  They would not give a copy of it to the defense attorneys.  And the reason they wouldn't do that is the state attorney said, well, we can't.  It's child pornography.  If we were to give you this, it would be child pornography.  But yet he's showing it to an ABC News Nightline crew.  Then he sends ABC News in New York a copy of this tape, all for the purpose of swaying  the editor's opinion about Joe Francis so they would do a negative piece on Joe, which is 
[02:45:00]  clearly something a prosecutor should never do, let alone the fact he's disseminating child  pornography and displaying child pornography.  These are the type of people that we're up against and they will literally do anything  they can do, whether it's lawful or otherwise, in order to try to destroy Joe Francis' life.  Sounds like, oh boy, I'd like to see that lady's tits, whoever she is.  Sounds like Joe's fucked.  Joe, that really, I mean, that's disgusting that that's happening to you. 
[02:45:30]  Like, what is, I mean, I'm trying to clear up all the misconceptions, you know, out there,  but like, what, I mean, you guys have heard a completely different story probably about  what's, why I'm in jail and why this, I mean, right?  Did you guys have a different story?  Yeah, well, there's a few stories.  The one about the girls that were only 17 and then the, some kind of a tax problem.  There is a tax issue, which I do have bail on.  That's correct.  Oh, okay.  But I'm not in jail because of the tax issue.  I'm in jail because of Florida. 
[02:46:00]  So you never, you never filmed girls underage, right?  Naked?  No.  The, the allegation of the 17-year-old girls from the 2003 incident when they charged me  with 71 felonies because two 17-year-olds took a shower and I wasn't there is ridiculous.  They, um, an independent contractor shooting footage that he sells to Girls Gone Wild filmed  two girls that lied about their age, that presented false identification, that, that signed  written release forms, by the way, all of this is posted at meetyourfrancis.com. 
[02:46:30]  You can read their written release forms where they, you know, lied about their age.  They lied about their age on camera.  They admitted lying about their age and they, uh, did a shower scene for this cameraman.  I've never seen the tape.  I wasn't there.  I have.  And they felt because I owned the company that I was liable somehow.  Now, what does this all mean for Girls Gone Wild Island?  Well, Girls Gone Wild is, you know, you know, people buy Girls Gone Wild because it's hot  naked chicks, you know, people don't buy Girls Gone Wild as much as I'd like to think for 
[02:47:00]  Joe Francis.  Um, Girls Gone Wild, you know, thrives.  And the funny thing about it is, you know, controversy, you know, sales have gone up.  I thought you were...  And it continues to be, you know...  I thought...  That's free action for you.  You don't have to pay for it.  It's, you know, come on.  That one, uh, have you gotten heat from, from that?  Because the commercials are pretty risque.  Not for me.  I would like to see, you know, internal examinations, to tell you the truth. 
[02:47:30]  But, uh, you know, the, the, the Girls Gone Wild logo over the, uh, nipples and, and, uh,  vagina and, and it's barely showing and the chicks making out.  You get a lot of, uh, complaints about that?  I mean, we don't, I mean, they have to, they, they're vetted through standards and practices  of, of the majors, you know, so...  Yeah.  I mean, we, we go through a lot.  I mean, you should see the versions that I want to hear that, uh, that, that are pre,  they're pre-S&T. 
[02:48:00]  Hey, uh, what, what kind of abuse in jail?  Did you talk about that yet?  Oh.  Here, hold on.  I'm going to call that kid.  Talk to Dave Houston here for a second.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for using Evercom.  Wait, we actually have to talk to a lawyer for a few minutes?  So, Phil?  Are you kidding me?  Look at that way.  Hey, what kind of, what kind of abuse was, uh, he, he called in jail?  You know, in the Panama City facility, uh, let me just give you a list of it.  Uh, first of all, they'd put his food outside of his reach.  They'd come by later and they'd say, oh, looks like Joe Francis doesn't want to eat today.  Well, we better make a note of that.  They'd take the food away. 
[02:48:30]  They'd put him in a cell they could cool down and they'd keep it at about 60 degrees and  wouldn't give him a blanket.  They also had him in a cell with what amounted to a street light that they kept on 24 hours  a day.  And we're talking a small area lit up by what amounts to a street light.  And one of the other major league hits was when they would take him to allow him a shower,  which was infrequent.  They'd put him in shackles and belly chains and then handcuff him to the belly chains while  he was in the shower. 
[02:49:00]  Now, that just gives you a kind of a preview of the sort of treatment that he was receiving.  Well, exactly.  Did he film the wrong girl?  Like, is there a chick that he filmed down there that's related to the sheriff or the  judge?  No.  What really happened was in 2003, Panama City Beach, Florida made a decision.  They wanted to start changing their image.  They want to get rid of this spring break phenomenon they live off that they created.  When Joe Francis made the decision he was going to do a spring break in Panama City, Florida, 
[02:49:30]  they told him straight up, you're not coming here.  And publicly, they announced that he was scum-sucking trash.  And if he tried to come to their town, he'd be arrested.  Joe made the mistake of enforcing his First Amendment rights.  He went through the federal court process to do it, which is appropriate.  And when he won, you heard the rest of the story.  Two weeks later, he's arrested for more felonies than one person has ever been charged with  in the state of Florida at one time.  Well, so what's going to eventually happen?  What's his next legal step?  How long is he going to be trapped there for?  We have a writ, which is simply an emergency motion. 
[02:50:00]  It's our way of saying to a federal judge, judge, you need to review what the state of  Florida is doing to this guy.  They're perverting your order where you allowed him bail.  They're perverting the Constitution because they're taking away all of his due process rights.  They're out on the airwaves trying to poison the public against him so they can prejudice  a jury pool.  So we're asking a federal judge to get involved and tell Florida, I'm not going to honor your  hold.  I'm going to allow Joe Francis to bail out, and he'll be free up until the time you give 
[02:50:30]  him a trial.  Wow.  What kind of ramifications will there be for the, I don't know, the prosecutor, but the  judge or the sheriff?  What kind of ramifications are they going to face?  We've asked the governor of the state of Florida, and this is something your listeners  can help us with, and the attorney general of the state of Florida to open an investigation,  not only into this whole matter as it concerns what they've done to Joe Francis, but as well  the felonies that we allege the state prosecutor committed when he's showing child pornography 
[02:51:00]  to Martin Brashear.  If the governor, and we have no doubt, listen, this isn't an indictment of the entire state  of Florida.  This is one small county.  We're asking the people of Florida through the governor and the attorney general's office  to get involved and to cure this problem because obviously it's out of control.  If that happens, if your listeners are willing to do so, they can go to this website.  MeetJoeFrancis.com.  They can click a button that says Help Now.  That button will then take them to a place where they can just put their email name and 
[02:51:30]  address.  That then auto-generates a letter to the governor and the attorney general requesting they get  involved in an investigation of this county.  Good.  So basically, if you like tits, you should go to that website.  Absolutely.  If you want to see tits in the future.  Hey, Joe, is it true that you're making Guys Gone Wild tapes in jail?  Well, Joe Francis goes wild.  You know, the truth is, we own the Guys Gone Wild brand and I just can't make it.  How about Prisoners Gone Wild on Joe Francis' ass?  We've seen some of the infomercials. 
[02:52:00]  Subject to monitoring.  Of course.  Are you guys interested in starring?  Is that why you're asking me or?  No, some of those infomercials are like, hot college guys.  And you go, you know, it's the same format, but somehow it's...  You would have had to be watching the Logo Network because I think we're only...  I don't, you know, I don't...  I love Logo.  Great.  So what you're saying, Joe, is that you're having a good time.  Um, why have you guys never been out with me on a Girls Gone Wild shoot before? 
[02:52:30]  I don't know.  Uh, because you never invited us, Joe.  We don't want to go to jail?  We don't want to go to jail.  Dude, as soon as you get out.  Yeah, right.  Because we like our freedom.  But, you know, spring break, I think we can go out and have some fun.  Um, how about jail break?  When are you looking at getting out?  Do you know?  Yeah, would you guys come get me?  Yeah, we'll just bust you out.  Are you aware of our Whip Him Out Wednesday promotion, Joe?  Tell me about that.  Uh, we do a little tit thing, too.  You know, but we stay out of jail.  We try to, anyway.  Yeah.  Uh, you had Doug Stanhope help you once, right? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he talks about that.  I think he was...  Why were you laughing?  What did he say?  Because he was stoned the entire time, and he had no clue what was going on.  I saw the commercials for it.  I mean, that was basically the entire time he worked for us.  Yeah.  He just stoned a drunk.  He was just drunk off his ass, and when I saw the infomercial for that one, I was like,  oh my god, Doug does not know where he is.  He's slurring through the commercial.  Not the time he really doesn't know where he is.  Hey, Joe, when is your writ going to be answered by the judge, or however you phrase that? 
[02:53:30]  This is Dave Houston, guys.  We're trying to get a hearing this week.  Yeah.  And we're asking the federal judge to look at some supplemental information we filed last week as well.  There's absolutely no reason that justifies Joe Francis as far as this continued incarceration.  It's crazy.  And I've done this for almost 30 years.  I've never seen a case like this.  I've never seen one this abusive that's based on less of a charge.  And a lot of times people, I tell them this story, and people say, hey, okay, well, what's the other side? 
[02:54:00]  You've got to be leaving something out.  So when we created this website, we made sure to support everything with court orders, transcripts, articles, documents.  And this isn't our side of what's happening.  This is what's happened.  And it's so hard to get people to believe it because it is so outrageous.  And that's really our biggest hurdle, even in the federal court system.  Florida seems to have this moral thing where they really are all about tits and ass, the majority of the state, for spring break. 
[02:54:30]  And they love the fact that people are down there in bikinis just fucking and going crazy.  But then they try to clean up every once in a while.  Like, they arrested Luther Campbell, I think, was in Broward County.  Lenny Bruce, too, right?  Yeah, they really are full of shit done in Florida.  Well, you know what the mayor said?  And this is really telling about spring break.  He said it was time to, quote, take it in the backyard, dig a hole, shoot it in the head, and bury it. 
[02:55:00]  And that's what they want to do.  They want to shove it out of the way because now they want to sell timeshares.  This call is subject to monitoring and recording.  And the problem is Joe Francis didn't create spring break in Panama City, Florida.  He just went down to film what they created, and that's why they wanted to shut him up.  Now, is the company still running with you in jail?  Yeah.  Look, there's a very talented president of my company, Scott Barber, runs the company.  You're like a Don in jail running things. 
[02:55:30]  The what?  You're like a Don in jail still running things, though.  You know, we're in 15 countries.  We'll be in 30 countries by the end of next year.  I mean, you're not going to kill Girls Gone Wild.  You know, I know their goal was to kill Girls Gone Wild more than Joe Francis.  And, you know, but Girls Gone Wild is Girls Gone Wild.  You know, it's not going anywhere.  Well, Joe, you're a martyr for everyone who likes jacking off and hang in there. 
[02:56:00]  Meet Joe Francis dot com, right?  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  So we'll encourage the listeners to go there.  All right, man.  Good luck to you, Joe.  Guys, hey, thank you so much, man.  It was cool hanging out with you guys.  All right.  Take care.  Later, man.  Thanks.  Man, that shit makes me so angry when I hear about the legal system abusing a guy on a moral level like that,  just for showing tits, that is enraging.  If that's the story.  Girls that lied about their age and they were 17.  Of course it is.  It's a little attack. 
[02:56:30]  Fuckheads in Florida.  Especially if they were 17.  It's like, come on, man.  Not a 13-year-old girl.  17.  But I have three daughters, so I get a little...  I'm both a perv and I'm also a dad.  You're just disappointed that they haven't been asked?  Well, you know, I've been with, you know, 60 to 70 underage girls and filmed it.  But Jeff made a full documentary, a 20-hour documentary.  Yes.  This guy should not be in jail.  And girls gone wild.  He should not be in jail for that shit.  That is enraging, those fucking hillbillies. 
[02:57:00]  I'm sure him going on your radio show really helps us cause...  It absolutely does, though, because it's like...  It does.  You get people calling...  He's a douchebag.  Doesn't help.  Doesn't matter.  He still shouldn't be in jail for eight months.  Showing off and bragging from jail.  I think he should be in jail for being in the videos.  Stay out.  Horse's ass he may be.  He should not be in jail for fucking eight months because those fucking hillbillies don't  like what he's doing.  That makes me sick.  But censorship is what it is.  It is...  Go, Bob.  Finish it down. 
[02:57:30]  I don't know.  I didn't talk during it because it's an awkward...  He's completely right.  If what he's saying is true, I'm not saying...  It's karma.  He's a douchebag and they're...  You don't like him?  Every time I see him, he's bragging and cocky and...  I've met him and he's been nice to me over the years.  But you're Bob Saget.  Everybody's nice to you.  You didn't have to work my name into this, did you?  Everyone's a name dropper.  I kind of wanted to keep it under the radar.  Bob wasn't even in here the last half hour.  He just came back into the studio.  Hey, Joe may be a total horse's ass, but legally they cannot fucking lock a guy up without 
[02:58:00]  bail.  You're right.  I agree.  For eight months.  You're correct.  Fucking sickening.  It's unconsensational.  Fucking disgusting.  Meet Joe Francis dot com.  We gotta take a break.

[03:00:00]  Opie and Anthony, Jeffrey Ross, Stress Factory, tomorrow night.  Yeah.  Bob Saget, Drowsy Chaperone, the Marquee Theater here in Manhattan, almost every day of the week.  I guess every day except Monday.  Go to DrowsyChaperone.com for ticket info.  Jim Norton, New Year's, North Fork Theater, Westbury, Long Island.  Tickets on sale now through Ticketmaster. 
[03:00:30]  Do you actually, will you be on stage at midnight?  How does that go down?  No, it's an 8 o'clock show done by 9.30.  I've done those, but I know a lot of times people want to be out and drinking, and I want it to be somewhere else.  Like maybe FH Riley.  Seriously, you're somewhere celebrating, just having fun.  FH is maybe 20 minutes from that theater, maybe.  Maybe even 15.  No, no, because you've got to get off the expressway.  That's the pain in the ass part.  20 minutes.  So you get some cheesecake.  Yeah.  For New Year's, Jimmy.  A piece of Oreo cheesecake.  You can like celebrate the big night with a piece of cheesecake for my sister.  That's an easy drive. 
[03:01:00]  I did that place, and Jim Norton is the person you want to see on New Year's.  I would actually, that would be hilarious.  I'm there.  We got the Amy Fisher DVD.  Yes, it's all queued up and ready to go.  My sister's having her holiday party this weekend, so Anne, if you're on Long Island this weekend,  stop on by and say hi.  We will be playing the Amy Fisher tape during the Christmas party.  Oh, wonderful.  That's a guarantee.  That's a good family moment.  So here we go.  The video.  It's Amy walking up the stairs.  He's walking up the stairs.  Amy walking up the stairs. 
[03:01:30]  Up the stairs.  Up the stairs.  Up the stairs.  Up the stairs.  Up the stairs.  Up the stairs.  Up the stairs.  What's wrong, Patty?  That's one of those echo things.  Is that like two mirrors in a barbershop?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Feeding through something.  All right, here we go.  Red Light District.  There she goes.  Amy Fisher coming up the stairs in a towel.  In a towel.  When was this?  Red Light District presents Amy Fisher.  Now she's soaping up her snitch.  An exclusive presentation.  Taking the towel off.  Now she's in the shower.  Ew.  All right, now she's laying back on the bed with a dildo going to town. 
[03:02:00]  Amy Fisher caught on tape as she's riding a car.  Whoa.  And she's getting.  Wow.  Her husband has good cheeks.  Oh, man.  She's got to fucking shave her asshole.  Holy shit.  Now she's kind of in bondage.  Jack Waltz is eating her ass.  Jack Waltz.  There she is nude in a pool.  This is just the opening montage, I guess, where they're showing.  They gave the whole thing away, though. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, his dick looks like a fucking.  He saw that.  His dick looks like Play-Doh.  He's squeezed.  What vegetable did that look like?  It looked like a yam.  It looked like a rhubarb.  It looked like an onk.  You squeeze it and the ears come out.  All right, here you go.  Amy teasing her hair.  She looks better here than she did in the preview.  She's putting a little hairspray on her hair.  She's topless.  She's got panties on.  She's looking in the mirror.  All of a sudden, she's in the bathtub soaping up her boobies.  Is that Mickey Mouse on her stomach there?  I don't know what the fuck that is.  She's got an awful tattoo around her belly button.  Yeah, it's like three things. 
[03:03:00]  She had two kids, by the way.  You can't really tell that she had a few kids.  She's not a good, sexy soap-er-upper.  She looks like she's taking a rape bath.  I'm glad she did this.  It's a hard time she got shot in the face.  Yeah, she's very awkward with the soaping up of the body.  Yeah, she doesn't know how to do it sexy.  She looks like she's just washing.  She's going out and has to wash.  She's soaping up her ass crack.  The ass needs a little cardio, just a little.  She cannot work. 
[03:03:30]  That's the worst fucking ass shake I've ever seen in my life.  And how about this other actor, Joe?  I'm going to butt-fuck you in the butt out.  Yeah, the guy fucking her is her husband.  Can we hear the audio of this?  That's her husband?  Yeah.  Really?  He's a Joey Buttifuco look-alike, this guy.  And he's an actual husband?  All right, wait, wait.  Let's listen to Amy.  Oh, I got to watch this.  Oh, Jesus.  Sterling Hayden is getting his dick sucked.  Sterling Hayden.  I'm a little cranky. 
[03:04:00]  Look at him sucking his gut in.  That's her real husband?  Yeah, but they love each other.  Listen to the awful Long Island accent.  But they love each other.  That's nice.  Listen, listen.  Come on, my breasts.  I'm going to fuck you in the five pounds.  Go ahead.  Come on, my breasts.  Come on, my breasts.  Come on, my breasts.  Come on, my breasts.  Come on, my breasts.  I'm going to rub it in my knifes.  Can you not mention any of my credits now?  Come on, my breasts.  Bob Saget is up the building.  This is the worst dirty talk ever.  And it's the awful Long Island accent. 
[03:04:30]  Whoa.  There's a money shot right off the bat.  Can you rub it in your shirt?  Can you rub it?  How could she rub it on anything?  You just drooled out of your dick.  That is the unsexiest dialogue I've ever heard.  I had nothing.  Oh, she's awful.  She's sexy.  Oh, a little taste in my daddy's cum.  Oh.  Ew.  Jesus.  Did you say taste in my daddy's cum?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Okay.  Now there's an ass shot.  You want to spank me a little bit?  Everybody watching this does. 
[03:05:00]  I feel like I was a bad girl.  Well, you kind of are.  You shot a woman in the face.  Yeah, you should get more than a spanking.  You are a bad girl.  Oh, I like that a lot.  She likes her daddy.  I'm going to touch my pussy.  All right.  She's going to touch her pussy.  All right.  Yeah.  Look at those old mechanic's hands.  Look at the crooked dick.  Oh, he's just got nothing going on either.  He was jacking a car, but it fell on his penis.  Looks like something in the case of Zabok.  There's nothing going on there. 
[03:05:30]  You want to try the herring?  He's a mean looking fuck, though.  Yeah, I don't think we should be talking about him.  I really don't.  He's like, I love looking at it.  They love each other, by the way.  Yeah.  Apparently.  He's good.  He's a big, long man.  Listen to him.  He's a mechanic?  A Long Island Yenta.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Next stop, Hicksville.  Hicksville.  Next stop, Hicksville.  Jamaican station, transfer in Jamaica.  By the way, this is good for the selling. 
[03:06:00]  This broadcast is good for the selling of this DVD.  Is it not?  Yes.  This helps this.  Look at us promoting.  She has a great pussy, though.  You like that?  Yeah, I do.  She just showed you again.  She's blowing him now.  Lifting her leg up in the air so you can see her rubbing her snatch.  This all started.  This guy doesn't move, though.  He's like a dead person.  He just lays there.  When he was coming, he was just like, oh, yeah, rub it in your tits.  You look like someone perusing the library.  Yeah, when he was improv.  Not perusing the library. 
[03:06:30]  Fucking unfunny.  Is that, do you think that's an original, that painting above the couch?  Yeah.  Very nice.  By the way, Mary Jo drools better than this guy comes.  Oh, God.  That's a good fix.  Oh, a little mouth fucking.  He's got a brown bag.  I like this guy.  Brown bag.  He shaved his scrotomy.  He's got a fucking brown bag.  It disappears.  I think he took a pie pan and cut the center of it out when he sunbeds.  That's a suck it. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, this guy's good.  That's a good girl.  This guy's like 80 years old.  You are good.  What do you think they met?  What do you think they met?  I don't know.  Hopefully I'm going to.  She's going through the insert.  There we go.  The cock.  Now there's some fucking going on.  They're the worst dirty talkers.  The cock is so bad.  This rules.  I like that.  Yeah.  I was going to take a nap after this.  I think I'm disturbed.  Oh, I like that.  Where are the kids when all this is happening? 
[03:07:30]  Holding the camera.  They have kids?  Holding the camera.  Do they have kids?  She's on top sideways.  Don't worry if it gets.  What?  What?  Don't worry if it gets.  Gets.  What?  Soft?  Soft.  They have kids?  Yeah.  There's some better lighting there.  I think the sun was going down.  Who do you think is running the camera, Jeffrey?  Like the aristocrat.  Dysfunctional family.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, that dick's going to bend.  Oh, don't bend. 
[03:08:00]  Fuck that pussy.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, I am.  It's going to be sexy and literal.  Can you rewind that a little bit?  Fuck my pussy.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, I am.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I am.  I'm just asking, are we adding time to this now?  Yeah.  Now listen to this great dialogue.  Oh, fuck my little pussy.  Oh, I am.  Power of suggestion.  Yeah.  It's little, remember?  Come on my tits. 
[03:08:30]  I heard you.  Come on my amazing tits.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, feel my ass.  Oh, take me to the drowsy shop.  Feel my ass.  Please do not mention my credits ever again in this next hour.  You got that Bayshore accent.  And it's awful.  I can grab my tits and she goes, yeah, touch my tits.  Take me to Jim Norton on New Year's.  Take me to Jim Norton.  I want to see him at the North Fork.  North Fork my pussy.  The guy's ready to drool again.  Here we go.  North Fork me.  Another drool shot. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, you think.  Oh, maybe not.  That's a good move.  He's straddling her with his foot, his leg propped up, and she's laying below his leg,  and she's leaning up, sucking his dick.  More cumming on the tits.  How about the face, you non-trooper?  Oh, my God.  What the hell is that?  This dick cums.  It looks like my hand when I'm holding an ice cream cone in August.  It fucking just kind of bubbles over uneventfully.  I've never seen a cum shot shoot backwards before.  That's awful. 
[03:09:30]  What the fuck?  He just came out of balls.  He did.  He just rolled out his own balls.  He's like, come on your balls.  Come on your balls.  Now he is rubbing it in with his indented play ball.  I want to take this moment to make sure people know that Bob Saget will be...  Please do not.  No, no.  I can't even believe I'm in the building.  Jesus.  Oh, now she's in the bathtub.  Yeah.  Oh, the jacuzzi's running.  The jacuzzi, sure.  Yeah, she's got to clean the triple.  He's taking a shit right now.  Here's more sexy tick washing. 
[03:10:00]  He's got a little sponge there, and she's going over herself.  Again, very utilitarian wash job.  I've seen people wash a truck sexier than she washed on her own clothes.  This is horrendous.  Jim, you did the kid wine?  I'm being called out on it.  I had no idea.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  She, uh...  She's a nice vag.  And a great little big size.  She does.  She don't look that bad.  Nice juicy little ass.  I mean, I would definitely fucking put my face in there and smell.  Nice breast implants.  Way to wash her ass crack, though.  Look at that. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, that's sexy.  Yeah.  Why don't you just hang a fucking...  You wash that ass crack.  Hang a little vanilla thing to her teeth when she's finished.  I like how there's an extra tile that just sits kind of out in the open there.  That matches the stuff around the molding of the window.  This is fucking awful.  Yes.  What are you guys looking at?  I've seen people clean the assholes of cancer patients.  I think Bob's doing the wrong stuff in this video.  The caulking is really good around the tub.  Why don't you look at...  Look at the girl, will ya?  She has a big clit.  She fucking rules.  I have a tub similar to that.  Oh.  Her clit is bigger than my dick. 
[03:11:00]  She has a nice fucking...  She seems to not know how to shave very well, though.  Now, she's a little chafed.  I want to take this moment to remind people that we have a Broadway star on our show today.  This is the end of a career.  Oh, no.  Broadway as in homeless.  Here comes Mr. Personality in the tub.  Great.  Oh, no.  He's back.  Is this you and Joanne Worland?  No, please.  I want to get your pussy all nice and clean for later, so...  What?  My son.  For later for the company.  My son.  We put the muscles out. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to put a glass egg on your pussy and look at it.  This is fantastic.  He's not fingering her as he stands up.  Kiss me.  They're all soapy, and he's fingering her as she stands up.  She likes Daddy's cock.  I didn't think it'd be this quick to ruin a career.  Did you guys really make it fast?  Hang with us, man.  There he goes.  Hey, this is wonderful, huh?  Fuck my pussy.  Go ahead.  This is like good calamar.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  The guy's face is much tanner than the rest of his body. 
[03:12:00]  I love this guy.  All right.  She's in bed now on her knees wearing little boy shorts.  I think his idea was.  Is this her idea or his idea?  Quickly come down.  All right.  The panties come off.  They need to pay a few bills.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  This nice place was leaked out.  Please.  Let's make some porno.  No, but they'll make some money on it, right?  Sexy talk.  Come here.  Do they make some money on this?  Do you know?  Yeah.  They will now.  They're promoting amyfisher.com right in the box, so they don't have a problem with 
[03:12:30]  this.  Yeah, I love it.  Yeah, yeah, I love it.  Yeah.  I love it.  It's up there with apple pie and baseball.  Her clit is the size of the five towns.  I feel like I'm stuck in the Holland Tunnel right now.  Look at the size of that asshole.  I love a nice, deep, dark ass.  Yeah, well, see.  I do.  I like a dark asshole.  Why is that?  I don't know.  It's just fucking deep and cavernous.  I love that shit.  It looked like she was set up for an ass fucking.  What happened? 
[03:13:00]  I don't know.  If an asshole is very...  It's the old guy's arthritis.  And it had a fucking Abe Lincoln hat on it.  He forgot to put a windscreen on his cock.  He's got a shotgun cock.  That's my dad.  That pussy's a hurt.  That's like my dad.  What'd he say?  That pussy's a hurt.  Looks like an elephant's ass.  Yeah.  My daddy's cum.  That's so hot. 
[03:13:30]  Ew.  So, Bob, please don't.  She's fingering herself pretty quickly.  Can you actually call me something else now?  That's not that sound.  Sidney.  So, John.  We got John Stamos in the studio.  That's right.  Put it up your ass.  Come on.  Oh, God in heaven.  Come on.  I'm actually pinching my shaft.  This is pretty fucking good.  That's good.  Look at that deep, dark asshole.  You like that?  That's hot.  She's got...  You make it sound like Hershey's chocolate. 
[03:14:00]  Dude, she's got the...  Hold on.  She's got the start of an ass cave.  If I run for the exit, you guys will talk about that forever, right?  Yeah.  All right.  I sit here.  There's nothing I can do.  You're going to have to sit here until at least we screen and get your reaction for  two girls, one cup.  Bob, why don't you talk about the duvet or something that you see in these shots?  Actually, there's a lovely...  The fireplace has a really great metal grating.  Yeah.  Oh, that's the widescreen.  What is that?  Is that another painting? 
[03:14:30]  That would be an asshole.  And that would be a marital voice.  That's not a widescreen.  That's an asshole.  There's a mirror on the wall, yet I can't see the camera.  Good technique.  I love that she loves old cock.  It turns me on when she wants daddy's cock in her.  What a dirty girl.  Can this guy smile once?  He's not happy here.  I've got to get down at a job site and make sure the concrete's being poured properly.  This is how he does his work.  I mean, he's very methodical about it.  I have a feeling he was forced into making this sex take.  I think this is all her idea. 
[03:15:00]  He has the tannest head I've ever seen.  I think it's her idea also.  Yeah.  Look at his tan head and his pale body.  He's got a catty tan.  Big dildo now going in her pussy.  Vibrating dildo.  What's the show you guys have after this?  Is it really dirty?  The next show?  Ron and Fez.  Oh, Ron and Fez.  It's just the filthiest show ever.  Just filthy.  Unbelievable.  See, we could just sit around and talk about a porno movie that we watch. 
[03:15:30]  Wait, hold on.  I'm going to watch it.  It's just relief.  Fuck this woman.  Right now she's riding the...  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Sam.  Give me that what it deserved.  The hearty chuckle.  Please, more dialogue.  Could you jerk off to this, Jim?  He's doing it right now.  Oh, are you?  I got like five and a half going.  Yeah. 
[03:16:00]  At this moment, I wanted to borrow my...  Oh, there's a cameraman.  I just saw the cameraman in the mirror.  I was wondering.  Is it him?  I don't know.  Wow, she's very sexually putting the vibrator.  You know, it's awkward in here when Bob Saget's turning down a plug.  There's one in her vagina.  Yeah, it certainly is.  Very sexy the way she's using it.  Jeffrey Ross Stress Factory tomorrow night.  Heather Mills is sexier.  Please, no credits.  No credits at all.  So, Bob, one versus... 
[03:16:30]  How fucking hot is that sound?  We're looking at one versus four.  One versus 100 goes on January 4th.  All right.  And for eight shows straight.  You just don't want to mention...  No, you can't mention the Broadway show here.  Oh, that's good.  She does have a little frankentit going on.  Her pussy looks really red, too, and angry.  Yeah, she's sore.  It's angry.  It's like her...  Looks like Mary Jo's eye socket.  Oh, God.  Her mouth. 
[03:17:00]  Mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  She's getting shot in the eye.  Dope.  Wow.  Can we fast forward through this fucking...  I want to see fucking...  I want to see McCluskey fucking her again.  All right.  Ernie Borgnine?  I've fucked enough of you women.  Come on your balls.  I know.  She's a war hero.  Captain, hold her up.  Get some more backdraft.  Uh-oh.  What does he got?  He spanks her.  He's got a paddle.  He looks like Paulie Walnut and...  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Paulie Walnut.  And Soprano's daughter.  What's her face?  Meadow.  Meadow.  It's Meadow and Paulie Walnut.  Oh, shit.  Oh, hey.  Fuck you.  I'm going to spank you.  I'm going to just take control of you.  You're so beautiful.  Oh, he's great.  This guy's a natural.  He's great.  When I'm done, a turd's going to shoot out of your ass.  That's fantastic.  I can't take control of you.  He's from the fucking bohemian school of acting.  What we're going to do here, we're going to put some undercoating in. 
[03:18:00]  The person you made for me, wasn't it?  It's creative for me.  I'm going to check under the hood.  You, Joey Butterfugo, whoever.  You're all right?  Yeah.  I'm going to hit you with my shoehorn, and I'm going to put on a size 12.  I'm going to get you a job with the union.  I love the fact he has a Bob Barker hairdo.  You should have been there for me.  I could have been somebody.  She's on her hands and knees, and he's caressing her ass and spanking her.  Yeah, and he's really slacking her.  He loves her.  He has a nice ass.  This guy loves her. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  He's like really...  And he's licking his fingers.  I can't watch this.  I don't want to see him eat chicken, I'll tell you that.  There he goes.  There he goes, Bob.  Look at that asshole.  Look at Sandy Duncan's eye socket.  He's fucking staring at him.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  It's his hands labyrinth.  It's looking like an ass cave, man.  That's right.  I like that.  Put your nose in the mouth.  If you've ever wanted to watch Leslie Nielsen eat snatch, here's the opportunity.  Fuck someone else.  You ever see the nuts when Barbra Streisand killed him? 
[03:19:00]  I want a nice bubble bath.  And no matter what we say, you know it's going to get back to them.  They were like...  They were plugging our video on Opie and Anthony.  I hope so.  I don't want that.  I mean, they love each other.  They're very lovely.  Of course.  Oh, what the fuck is going on?  Happy birthday.  She's putting on a blindfold.  Blindfold.  Ooh, I guess.  It's magic.  She has her lines taped on the inside of her.  That's going to be magic.  Well, the guy put his pants on, thank God.  Just trust me and relax.  Okay.  Now he slowly goes off and brings in three guys from Wine Danch. 
[03:19:30]  How does that feel?  It feels good.  She's the unsexiest blindfold.  She looks like Elvira sleeping.  Oh, I love me so much.  I like that they're in a different room now.  Yeah.  A whole different motif.  It's like they're in some tiki room.  Booby Man from Brooklyn is saying he hopes that he fucks Amy with a muffler.  No, this was not filmed behind FH Royale.  I'm going to get you.  Oh.  First, I've got to get you to relax. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, relax.  Huh.  We'll have some scogeal later.  It's coming in a lot of people saying he sounds like Master Pope.  Hey, gentlemen.  Amy.  How could she relax?  The guy with three hits under his belt.  He's fucking blindfolded and was playing with her pussy.  The Iceman's fucking her.  Yeah.  Oh, now she's chained up.  Oh, boy.  How's she going to get free?  How old do you think this guy is?  A hundred. 
[03:20:30]  He's an older gentleman.  That was a very funny line by Broadway sensation.  Please not.  Don't mention it.  She's wearing shackles.  His cock's a dog leg left, by the way.  She's indeed wearing shackles around her ankles and wrists, and it's all chained up.  Oh, she's got a spanker, too.  My big cock feel good.  The average cock's there.  If you notice those chains, the key to the bathroom's hooked onto them.  Oh, we're losing your buddy, Bob.  I know.  He's smart. 
[03:21:00]  He wants to have a career.  I told him I want to live vicariously to him, so he should leave.  She's drinking champagne.  Bob, take a look at the video.  Amy's drinking champagne.  That could make her a little drowsy.  You should be your chaperone.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at those Fred Flintstone feet.  Come on, dude.  We're going to put some ribs on the bed.  He'll tip over.  Jesus.  It's a really nice comfort, though.  Oh, so wrong.  Yeah, I like that.  His feet are horrendous. 
[03:21:30]  You're right.  Look at them.  They're giants.  Oh, something happened to them.  The one on the left's been hobbled.  Look at it.  His toes are broken.  They're sewn back on.  A transmission fell on his foot.  What happened to his toes?  She shot him.  His toes shot him in the foot.  That's fucked up.  All right, now she's riding on top.  I'm obsessed with his toes.  Yeah, I know.  It's like caramel corn has replaced them.  Uh-oh, here she goes.  Here she goes. 
[03:22:00]  Here she goes.  Come on.  Ride that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Ride that.  Yeah.  You know, he doesn't even know what it is.  Ride that thing.  Ride that.  You know, he's in pretty good shape.  What is it?  Yes, he is.  He's got an old man body shape.  Oh, what's with his toes?  Oh, fuck it.  That's why he's putting him out of frame.  He hears that the only thing he's upset about is that we trashed his toes.  Yeah, hey.  Come on, huh?  I didn't mind the ball.  You gotta get these two in here.  Tomorrow, I'm gonna teach you how to be the best porn star. 
[03:22:30]  Wow.  He's gonna be a porn star.  Yeah.  A porn star.  I'm gonna have the right material out there.  He do.  He do.  I'm gonna kill a bod.  Kill a bod.  It's so hot.  He's horrid.  Yeah.  I wanna fuck you in every borough.  I wanna fuck you on the Long Island Expressway.  Oh, there she goes.  The BQE.  For a honeymoon, I'm gonna fuck you in Yonkers. 
[03:23:00]  They don't have any filler.  You gotta give them that much credit.  No filler in this sex tape.  It's all action.  Can they zoom in a little bit?  Jesus.  There we go.  Give me a little clip.  Give me what I like to call the old exit 52.  Is that an LIE joke?  Of course.  That's terrific.  That's a little local, but fuck them.  Yeah, why not?  Wow.  Just insert an exit around your home.  A popular exit.  Yeah.  Where some real white trash lives.  Something happened to the lens.  Yeah, what happened? 
[03:23:30]  That means, is someone filming this if all of a sudden a daylight lens hit it?  Oh, that's color correction.  Speaking of production value, when you're the star of a Broadway show...  Can you do me a favor?  What?  I'm not, you know, I'm a different person today.  Oh, okay.  That's it.  Yeah, that's it.  Broadway stars can't be even watching this crap.  I think this guy's changing, like, the white balance.  Yes.  During, uh...  Yeah, there's someone filming this, man.  Probably.  Yeah.  Broadway stars do watch this crap, but it's two of that guy.  Oh, my chest.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  That's the only difference.  And on Broadway, you can actually see these shops.  I mean, there's a lot of this.  Sure.  You can probably get this video, probably, right near where the theater is.  What theater would that be?  Marquee Theater, but I don't really want people that...  You're crazy.  I don't want...  Why would I mention that?  I don't know.  I couldn't help it.  What happened to our audio?  I don't know, but that was fucking...  That was pretty salty-ass, pretty salty talk.  All right.  Yeah.  You want to wait for one more drooling, or are we done?  Oh, money shots.  One more drool. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, touch my...  Oh, touch my what?  Was that really a money shot or, like, a chain shot?  Yeah, it was nothing.  Oh, blow-drying.  Oh, please be in the tub.  Oh, sweetie.  What's she going to say?  Do you want that?  Yeah, we got to hear her talk, because she's got that awful long-handed accent.  The one line she has is with a blower going.  Sweetie.  So sexy.  Yeah.  Hmm. 
[03:25:00]  Maybe I should just do you instead of my hair.  Oh, my hair.  I am.  She didn't say blow.  That would have been the joke, right?  Right.  Oh, man.  That was the line in the script.  She fucked it up.  She got the lines all wrong.  Oh, hey, baby.  Oh, this was the plan.  Ah, this view.  Man.  The old POV.  He's standing, holding the camera.  She's doing her thing.  Oh, God.  What is...  I think he closed it in a drawer.  I think he accidentally slammed something out of it. 
[03:25:30]  What are you talking about?  That's his left toe.  He's cock-toed.  It is dick, but where his toe was when it was severed.  This is a very popular point-of-view shot.  Oh, it tastes so good.  She's a cock-hack.  You little cock-hack.  Ken Burns could learn a lot from this tape.  Yeah.  I know.  There's an extra second on each side of the show.  Yeah.  We're never going to get out of here tonight.  I'm in here.  Get out of here. 
[03:26:00]  We're never going to get to see Queensryche at the...  Down at fucking Baby Huey's.  At Frank Cariola's joint.  We have to be at Rum Runners Oyster Bay.  For Thirsty Thursdays.  Oh, boy.  What is she doing now?  She's saying goodbye to the camera.  Walking around the house.  I love you.  Went down to the road.  She loves him.  Yeah.  That's what this is all about.  Take more daddy's cum, though.  That was hot.  That's what it's all about.  Love.  What is that tattoo, by the way?  This was so fun for a bigger audience, by the way. 
[03:26:30]  This is not a homemade set.  That's why they're nervous.  It's so awful.  Yeah.  Suck that chair.  You want to come fuck me?  All right.  I am.  What is it?  But with the promise of fast-forwarding, we keep going through.  We kind of tease me with it.  You know what sucks about fast-forwarding?  It never goes that far.  You always fast-forwarding, and they go, oh, stop, stop.  Let's see what that is.  Can you rewind that?  I have to hear what Mr. Second thought. 
[03:27:00]  Spread it with your fingers.  That's it.  Spread it with your fingers.  You should never talk during this.  Oh, it just extends it.  I missed something.  Will you back it up?  I hear this.  Yeah, Mr. Dialogue.  Oh, baby, I miss you.  You want to come fuck me?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:27:30]  You looking at my pussy?  I love you, pussy.  That was a good call, Jim.  That was a good call.  That sounds like it was dubbed in after, overdubbed.  He's talking through Darth Vader's helmet.  I love you, buddy.  Let's go to David in New Orleans.  David.  That little girl's clit.  Yeah, y'all glanced past Jimmy's great line when she turned on the hairdryer.  He said, please be in the tub.  Oh, shit.  Do you hear that?  Little girl's clit.  They role-played daddy little girl.  That's fucking hot.  Yeah, they're sick. 
[03:28:00]  Little girl's clit.  Yeah, you see those beautiful nipples that I love.  Play with those nipples.  Nipples.  Nipples.  Big nipples.  Squeeze those nipples.  All right.  Yeah, squeeze those nipples.  I'm going to lick your baby clit.  Come here.  Let me lick your preemie tits.  Come here.  Put that fetus mouth all over my cock.  Give me your unborn asshole.  Yeah, I'm going to rub my bent cock on your umbilical. 
[03:28:30]  Of course, John.  God, fuck me.  He's got his little finger in there.  I think he's accusing it or something.  He's looking for his car keys.  Not polite to point at my uterus.  So tight.  Let's touch me together.  I like that.  Let's touch me together.  Someone's in front of the camera.  Someone is pointing out that he sounds like thoughts and prayers.  Jimmy, thoughts and prayers.  You're in front of the camera.  Am I?  Oh. 
[03:29:00]  Of course, I want to examine this pussy.  Yeah.  That's sexy.  What itemizing.  You know what I like.  I would have.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Johnny Fontaine never licks that clit.  First, I would have rust-proofed it.  At the end of this thing, he comes and, like, air comes out of his car.  Ah, I hear that.  The old backyard.  Hey, Roland. 
[03:29:30]  What do you think of the tape?  We got Roland in the studio.  Grab a mic.  Have you seen some of this tape now?  What do you think of the Amy Fisher sex tape, Roland?  Yeah, I think so.  Get on mic.  Get on mic.  Right in there.  Oh, it takes the top off.  What?  Just like porn.  Showing her boobies and stuff.  It's on the way now.  Look at the raccoon statue on the left there.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Mm-hmm.  You know, it just can't be her house.  I think I'm going to have to use that one. 
[03:30:00]  This is the same neighborhood Aunt's mom lives in.  Yeah.  Yeah, they live right there.  Fast forward.  What did she...  What do you got there?  All right, she's putting lotion on her boobies and stuff.  All right.  She is.  Are we done?  Oh, yeah.  That was some damn good chatter, though.  One more money shot.  Yeah, we got to see one more...  One more shot.  One more dribble.  Yeah.  One more draw. 
[03:30:30]  It looks like his dick has a broken jaw.  Is this...  Try to eat fucking...  Cream of barley soup.  Is this a...  This is very long, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.  It's like crazy long.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a major motion picture.  Oh, boy.  And there she is coming up the stairs in her towel.  That's the beauty shot from the front credits.  And she goes into the bathroom.  Wouldn't it be funny if she was walking over a rug and she just started shitting like a horse?  She's in the shower doing that unsexy washing again. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, it's horrendous.  How dirty does she get?  They really don't have many...  Just a wash off after being in the pool.  Her foot up on the toilet.  It's fucking awful.  Nice.  That's sexy.  The little red boy shorts.  She's wearing a little red thing.  Yeah.  And here he comes.  Oh, great.  Here comes the animal.  Here he comes with his great...  Here comes George the animal steel.  What is he wearing?  A diaper.  What the fuck?  He's got a diaper on.  Holy shit.  There you go. 
[03:31:30]  All right.  It's a different room.  They really got it.  They had a bed and breakfast they live in.  It had to be one of the kids' rooms.  Oh, he's got nothing going on.  Oh, that can't be the kids' rooms.  He's got nothing going on.  There he goes.  We're zipping through old red face.  This guy's fucking head rules.  We've been here before.  You have to get this just to watch this guy.  He's a classic.  Oh, the old 69er.  Yeah.  God, it looks like he's gasping for air.  He's about to cum snot.  69 is flattering for him.  Here he comes.  It's a money shot.  It could be a money shot. 
[03:32:00]  Another money draw.  Another dribble shot.  That's a nice...  Come all over your balls again.  It's like a lava flow.  What's he doing?  I don't know.  I guess he gave up.  What's that gaping asshole again?  He can only cum once a month, so...  He's an older man.  Oh, why that shot?  Oh, God.  Look into my ass. 
[03:32:30]  It looks like a gavagool.  Hey.  Hey, you want a little sozeech?  I'm going to vomit.  Well, we're just waiting to...  Wow.  ...for an ending here.  It don't look like he's going to...  I don't think this thing ends.  We just fast-forwarded through five different sexual positions.  It never ends.  It's a loop.  It doesn't seem like this thing ends.  This is the longest thing I've ever done.  This is a good takeout.  This is a good takeout.  You get yours money's worth.  Oh, I just like this peacock.  He's packing, though. 
[03:33:00]  You've got to give him credit.  Where's Roland?  Yeah, she's very complimentary.  Did Roland run away to go puke?  This is not the best angle on her.  Roland.  No, no.  Yeah, he's packing.  I've got to give him credit.  I was wrong before.  Roland, give us some commentary.  What are you seeing right now?  I'll turn down the audio a little bit.  Okay, so stiff.  You know what I'm upset about?  You can't see his toes in this one.  Yeah, I want to see those toes.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  Backward cowgirl.  All right.  Roland, what do you think?  Eh, I mean, is this better?  What do you give it? 
[03:33:30]  I mean, you were doing impressions of Steve watching this, I heard?  Me?  No, I just went around.  It's nice.  That's better.  Is this weeks of production, you think?  Oh, yeah.  This is not a couple days.  No.  No.  So they're at other places.  They're at his place.  No, they live together, right?  No, what do you think?  They had the crew for two months?  It was like one day, you know.  We're living with a light.  That's why his cum shots look like grandma spinning up.  Drool on my face. 
[03:34:00]  My toes look like I have the diabetes.  Get your medical supplies from Liberty.  Hi, I'm Wilford Brimley.  And I'm fucking this bitch with diabetes.  Oatmeal comes out of his cock.  Diabetes cock.  You guys got gout.  Yeah.  All right, we're fast forwarding to it.  There he is.  The old fucking saggy ball shot.  His porn name is cockabetes.  I got the cockabetes.  Cockabetes.  I have to put my ball. 
[03:34:30]  Whoa, what the fuck is he doing there?  Oh, no.  That looks ridiculous.  I can't explain that.  I can't explain it.  He jumped off a building and landed in her pussy.  He's got one leg bent and all the way up in the air.  She's on her back with her legs back, and he's fucking her, and he's got one knee down.  Sky diving.  Sky diving.  It's a good thing.  Or it looks like he's doing a frog stroke in a pool.  Your pussy caught my fall.  His leg looks like he's making, and he's showing off his bicep. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, he's mighty mouth.  He's mighty mouth.  He's doing strongman arms with his legs as he's fucking her.  That looks so silly.  Now I'm glad I stuck around.  Oh, does that look silly?  Look at the severed.  Yeah, look at his stupid toe.  His foot looks like a fist.  That is dumb. 
[03:35:30]  Who fucks like that?  She loves it, though.  It's her favorite statue.  It's the only real scene in the whole movie.  That's a good...  He loves her.  She's a good fuck with her.  Oh, why?  All red forehead again.  He's on his back now.  Squeezing those tits.  How many dick pills is this guy on?  It looks like blood is going to shoot out of his other eyes.  Oh, yeah.  I bet you he is on my eye because his head's so red.  His head's all red.  You like daddy's cum, little girl?  This guy fucking rules.  Love that. 
[03:36:00]  All right.  She's falling out of the...  Skydiving into her pussy.  That's great.  Because it did kind of look like...  Yeah, man.  That going on.  He's acrobatic.  Yeah, he's...  Ah, shit.  I played high school football.  All right, that's...  Well, he's not a yoga guy.  Works out a lot.  Yeah, he does work out.  Yeah, well...  Oh, look at his toes again.  Dude, it's fucking...  Oh, God.  Something happened.  It's gout, maybe.  Disgusting.  Oh.  All right, here comes a...  Him and his good abs.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[03:36:30]  He's ready to drool again.  I think...  Oh.  What is that?  Oh, God.  It looks like a leaky pussy.  Dude, that didn't fucking...  He has to bring the cum to her.  That got zero distance.  Wow.  It didn't even fill up her belly button.  It fell out of his dick and went straight down.  It looks like fucking packing peanuts.  That's it?  That's it.  I guess that's it.  I think we're out of cold cream.  Wow.  There you go.  Play it again.  Play it again. 
[03:37:00]  Play it again.  Play it backwards.  How about...  It's like last week...  Yesterday I was pissed I wasn't on the show.  Now I just want to get the fuck out of here.  I just feel dirty.  Before we say goodbye to everybody, our own Jim Norton is doing a little Broadway himself  there.  Yes.  Tell me.  I got a little tape of him doing some Broadway shooting for you.  That's going to be good.  I can feel it.  No, it's really good.  I'm not familiar with this.  Yeah, ready?  Here it is.  For Bob Saget, the star of the Drowsy Chaperone, our own Jim Norton. 
[03:37:30]  Still doesn't feel right to say it.  For Broadway.  Coming soon to Broadway, Jim Norton of the Opie and Anthony show stars as that lovable red-headed  orphan in the new production of Annie.  The sun will come out.  Come on, Jimmy.  Tomorrow.  You got to lay in bed and die of cancer tomorrow.  Like Yul Brynner.  Oh, you used to be fun in the sun.  But now you're shitting in your bed.  And your head is full of mush like Lyle Alzado. 
[03:38:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Could I not have come up with a better rhyme than this?  Very funny.  Okay, one thing we got to do, though, before we wrap this up.  I think we need a reaction from Bob of Two Girls, One Cup.  He's just going to wind up thinking it's silly.  But we have every celebrity's...  I like everything you guys do.  Jeff, have you seen Two Girls, One Cup?  We'll do a double here.  Yeah, we've had every single celebrity's reaction to this.  Don't worry, there's no... 
[03:38:30]  I understand.  There's no smut.  No, you will...  It's just your reaction.  It's just your face.  That guy will not be skydiving into my mouth.  There'll be no porno that they see along with your video.  It's just your face.  I promise.  Try to get both of them in the shot if you could.  Jeff, do you want to sit here?  You might just come over here.  Maybe Jeffykins can sit here.  I've got to put it on this TV.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  And this goes...  This could be Bob's thing.  I don't care.  People can see my reaction to this.  Yeah.  It's sweeping the internet.  It really is.  Reaction shots.  Reaction videos to this.  And you do it with all your guests. 
[03:39:00]  It's a real sensation.  Not all, but most of them.  Yeah.  Everyone is making it.  I remember Ken Burns doing this.  Well, yeah, we should have done that for Ken Burns.  Two wars, one cup.  I've got the image of that video that we just saw in my head forever.  This will probably take it out.  This will cleanse the palate.  Really?  This is our first Broadway star to see this, too.  True.  Yeah.  True.  What?  Former Broadway star.  I wonder if I'm going to get shit for having done this today.  Come on.  Come on. 
[03:39:30]  Joey?  You're promoting your show, dude.  Joey Butterfugo?  Do you think he's going to be upset about this?  Joey Butterfugo?  No.  I bet you Joey's all cock.  Joey's pissed that it wasn't him.  Joey's probably got a fucking...  Joey's probably got a nine by six.  You need to get those two in here.  Yeah, we're trying.  That's why fucking...  We'll try.  That's why Amy banged...  I bet you Joey used to call her his little girl.  We ready?  Oh, daddy, when she was 17.  Maybe your dad used to call her that.  Yeah.  Keyboard decided to stop working, so...  Yeah.  It happens.  It's a messed up world. 
[03:40:00]  We'll have to type in.  We going to the friars for lunch?  No.  No, I got to go.  I got to go.  Nothing.  What?  I have to go because I got...  You're giving me a copy of this DVD, right?  No.  No.  No.  No.  What do we do?  What happened?  Do we start with line of the day?  We've always been able to have access to that wonderful video.  Oh, yeah.  It's just my keyboard's not working at all.  Your keyboard's not working.  And I need to type in that old URL.  Is it a wireless keyboard?  No.  No.  Hmm, that's what you need.  I don't know. 
[03:40:30]  That'll change it, yeah.  All right.  Should we do line of the day in the meantime?  Oh, I don't know what to say.  Line of the day brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  Free life scoring stats, bios, and news that will help you win big this season in fantasy  football.  All at BodogFantasy.net.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  I've never seen a cum shot shoot backwards before.  Jeff Ross, Stress Factory, tomorrow night in Brunswick, New Jersey. 
[03:41:00]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  The old POV.  He's standing, holding the camera as she's doing her thing.  Look at his bed things.  Oh, God, what is...  I think he closed it in a drawer.  It's one of my few comments that I've wanted to have today.  Broadway sensation Bob Saget with the runner-up line of the day.  I promptly stepped on your lap like a fucking rookie.  Drowsyshopper.com.  No, I did that to you today.  I apologize, Jimmy. 
[03:41:30]  You didn't?  Yeah, I did it.  A couple things you said were really funny.  I'm not going to get over it.  It happens, Bob.  I didn't even know it.  It happens.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night.  7-3-2-5-4-5-HA-HA.  Probably too funny.  Because Vinny puts a laugh in so you can remember.  Yeah.  What's he supposed to do with the club?  I changed the number to wah-wah.  Oh, that's good.  We're good now, Jeff. 
[03:42:00]  That's awesome.  That's hilarious.  I had a great time today.  Yeah.  Before line of the day, we got the camera, we got the video.  You guys look right over here.  Okay.  These two screens, okay?  Jeff, look over there.  Sam, you got a good shot, or is it too far away?  No, I got him.  You sure?  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  Two girls, one cup for Bob Saget and Jeff Ross.  Good, right?  Huh?  Nice.  Oh.  Oh, no. 
[03:42:30]  I can't.  Come on, Bob.  It's a little too poo.  Open your eyes.  I'm not a poo guy.  Can't do it.  That's your reaction.  Can't do it.  No, open your eyes.  Come on.  Can't.  Come on, Bob.  Can't do it.  Look, it's great.  Can't.  Now open your eyes.  I'm quitting show business.  I'm quitting.  I'm not going to do this.  Jeff, are you looking at that?  Wipe that shit-eating grin off your face.  I cannot believe.  That was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  Well, no.  Keep watching.  Keep watching.  Come on.  It's almost over. 
[03:43:00]  Well, they're going to puke.  That's what they always do.  You think Ken Burns found another second and a half?  Here we go.  Watch.  The music does work for me, because that's all I can do.  Oh, here we go.  Just to make it a little better.  No, no, no.  How do you guys watch it?  How do you not?  How do you?  I'm just not into, I'm not a poo guy.  Well, none of us are liars.  What's in a police girl?  This night I knew was going to happen.  A bus token?  Yeah.  Well, it's bulimic. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  All right.  Well, I think they have an eating disorder.  Yeah.  Is what I think.  I wonder if they scooped that out first.  As a dad.  Right.  As a father.  The director said, all right, look, don't puke into the shit cup too soon.  That's the climax.  Now I'm supposed to, like, go on with my life?  Hey, by the way, someone brings up a great point.  Bill Kaye from Philly writes, hey, oh, sure, he can tell scat jokes on the aristocrats,  but can't watch it?  No, but I was told to do that, and I stayed.  I don't like, I like talking about shit, but not talking, not seeing it. 
[03:44:00]  Really?  I think poo is, yeah, I do, I agree with what he's saying.  I understand what he's saying.  I don't agree, but I mean, I think it's funny to have a family going, dancing and shit.  But if I'm watching that, I can't watch it, because I'm just kidding.  You went from the aristocrats to the drowsy chaperone.  No, no, please.  I went from the aristocrats.  That was the worst thing I've ever seen.  Wow.  That was really bad.  That was depressing.  How do they talk them into doing that? 
[03:44:30]  Lily, you were gagging?  I was gagging.  You've done lovely Lily.  I've never seen it before.  You've never seen that?  Oh, yeah, Ron and Fresno in 3.  Never in my life.  That's the most vile shit I've ever seen.  Wait, wait, where did you see it?  Oh, I was watching from there, and Danny was forcing me to watch it.  Do they?  You look very good today, by the way.  Thank you.  You're dressed to solve a mystery.  It's that hat.  She's got her cute little detective's hat on.  It's my Annie Hall hat.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Now, did you have a good view of it? 
[03:45:00]  I did, yeah.  You weren't looking at it from the side or nothing?  Yeah, they forced me in there, and so they were making me watch it.  Oh, okay.  What was the worst part of it for you?  Um, the shit.  And the girl.  Why was it green?  Oh, turn around.  No, no, no.  Just take a look.  Just turn around.  Turn around.  Do you like the cup?  No, no, I can't.  I can't.  No, no, take a look.  Please turn around.  Just take a look.  Just look.  Oh, my God, it's everywhere.  No, no, take a look.  Take a look.  We got it on all 12 screens right now.  Oh, my God, it's disgusting.  Just look at the girls that they're doing. 
[03:45:30]  Look at it!  It's not that bad.  They must have put some sugar on you.  Ron and Fez, 12 to noon, look at it!  12 to 3.  I mean, 12 to noon is a very brief show.  Oh, that's everywhere!  It's everywhere.  You can't turn around anywhere.  Oh, my God.  It's on every screen.  I can't look at it.  It's two girls, one cup, in the round.  In the round.  I know, I can see it.  It's everywhere.  Open your eyes, Lily.  Take a look.  Oh, she's gagging.  Oh.  Don't gag.  You're okay, Lily?  Ron and Fez, 12 to 3.  Look at it for the vomiting of the shit.  Do it for Ron and Fez.  Do it for Ron and Fez! 
[03:46:00]  Do it for Ron and Fez!  Come on, baby.  Oh, your eyes are tearing.  All right, this part's the best part.  Watch.  Yeah, watch this part.  It's cute.  Watch.  They both just look so uncomfortable.  She's gagging.  They got big mouths full of shit.  The best part is they woke up and put makeup on, saying we got a big day.  We got a big shoot today.  How do people like that?  Well, they're interns.  I think it's more for the comedy.  That's more for the comedy.  That's Brazilian porn, man.  Wow, her eyes are tearing.  Poverty-stricken, they do anything for a few dollars.  Is that Brazil?  It's Brazilian?  Yeah, of course.  MFX?  Yes. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, poor Lily.  Her eyes are all tearing from gagging.  Disgusting.  Well, you know what you could do?  You could just puke into your hat.  Easy cleanup.  But I like my hat.  Rio Diarrho.  All right.  Lily from Ron and Fez.  Noon at 3.  Noon at 3.  Anything special on Ron and Fez today?  I will.  What?  What'd you say?  Did you say hello?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I said, is there anything special on Ron and Fez?  And she went, I will.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  I've never seen you.  Tell Ron and Fez hello.  You know Ronny's got to fire you now.  Oh, but I'm not hired.  That was your big opportunity to really plug the show. 
[03:47:00]  Wait a minute.  What's your job on the show?  You don't make money yet?  No.  Well, not for Ron and Fez.  I don't.  What is going on?  I do other things for XM and I get paid.  Okay.  Everyone is pretty much executive producer on that show.  But Earl, you know, he doesn't like people.  How did you get Earl to fall in love with you?  I don't know.  Black guys don't really like me.  I don't get her.  Who wouldn't fall in love with her?  Well, no.  I know that.  It wasn't a plan against you.  Believe me.  We're not looking at an ugly broad here.  But Earl, like, Earl's pretty much gay. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  He's pretty much.  If not, he's asexual.  Yeah.  But he didn't just think you were, like, an attractive girl.  He fell in love with you.  Right.  Black and white photos, the whole deal.  Yeah.  He actually photographed me in this hat.  Of course.  Yeah.  Did he?  Special.  And I was just wondering what you did to him.  Like, was it conversations?  Did you ever go out to eat with him?  Yeah.  We, like, hung out.  But we used to hang out in groups a lot.  And then we hung out once alone. 
[03:48:00]  But it was like, hey, let's go watch a movie or something.  Well, where'd you go to watch the movie?  Like, Times Square.  Lots of people around.  Oh, so you went to a movie?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Just you and him?  Well, not a date.  Like, I never.  But it was just you and him going to a movie?  Yeah.  Yeah, he definitely saw it.  The Amy Fisher thing?  Two girls eating poo.  I can't even remember what movie it was.  But I remember we watched the movie.  That means you guys were making out a lot.  No.  I saw that in the theater.  He took her to see Amistad and cut a hole in the bottom of the cup.  Fucking creeper all is. 
[03:48:30]  You shit in his mouth and called him the drowsy chaperon.  Please.  I don't know what to do.  There was a special.  I never had anything happen to me like this.  I'm so confused.  I might puke.  I might puke in a minute for that video.  Yeah.  Just get it out of your head.  I'm glad I didn't eat anything.  All right.  Well, let's.  Hey, Lily, did he hit on you or no?  No.  Earl's really asexual, I think.  So he never.  I never knew that he actually liked me because he doesn't have that sexual drive that I think  most men have.  He doesn't have any drive.  He doesn't have sexual work ethic. 
[03:49:00]  He doesn't drive a car.  He does drive a car.  He's got no drive.  None whatsoever.  What are his toes like?  I've never seen those.  They're probably like macadamia nuts.  They're like those hazelnuts and Brazil nuts.  We saw that in the Amy Fisher video.  They're the toes of the guy.  I'd rather see Amy Fisher's husband wearing flip-flops for the next video again.  All right.  Thank you, Lily.  His toes are flip-flops.  Thank you.  Ron is at noon to three.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Lily.  Or noon to 12.  That is a hat.  Lily has a hat on. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  She dresses so cute.  I like hats.  She is a cute girl.  But Jamie also has a hat on.  Huh?  Is that an Earl picture?  Yeah.  That's Lily in her hat.  That's actually a really good shot.  It's from the Earl collection.  She looks like she's six in that picture.  Is there anything you guys can show me?  That's a really good shot.  She looks like she's six.  But she looks like...  Could you click back on that one, sweet fan?  You got it.  She looks like a six-year-old girl in that picture.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, Jeff Ross.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:50:00]  I've never been to the Friars Club.  Let's go.  We have a meeting, though, first.  That hat.  Let's go tomorrow for lunch.  That's all I think of.  Is that a hat for lunch?  I was looking at the loons.  Do I have to wear a sports coat?  I got lost.  You're my knight in shining armor.  That's what the hat is.  She's got a totes rain hat.  It's an early lunch when you're done here.  All right.  How can you guys say lunch after that video we watch?  It makes you hungry.  What, are you going to have the chocolate mousse?  The pudding?  Wow. 
[03:50:30]  Push it all over my face.  Do you have anything you can show me that's not like a shit infested or a bent cock with  rotted toes?  You and Jeffrey Ross can make out with a big mouthful of pudding?  We can show you a commercial for the drowsy chaperone.  No.  That says nauseating at this point.  You're going to get the pate tomorrow, aren't you?  How much advertising does a Broadway show need?  That hat makes me want to watch Get Smart.  That video made me want to eat chopped liver.  I'm so sick over that.  That was green. 
[03:51:00]  That was green shit.  It wasn't color corrected, but you could tell it was...  And everybody loved how fast it came out in the cup.  It was like when at Carvel, when they fucking goose that thing and just fill the cup up  in a second.  I wonder, is that what it looks like for real when people...  Does it come out that fast for a person?  That, to me, honest to God...  It looks like an animal.  That's the one where you've got to clean the bottom of the toilet seat.  I shit like that when I eat almonds.  Almonds?  I swear to God, almonds give me fucking light as air fluff shit.  When I eat enough almonds... 
[03:51:30]  Like it's whipped shit.  That's exactly what it looks like.  It's like whipped cream, but that type of a consistency?  That's a Metamucil shit right there.  Yeah, probably.  Something's wrong with them.  There's something wrong with them.  They're both grain fed.  Why don't we do the line of the day and get the fuck out of here?  That sounds like an idea.  SmodogFantasy.net, thank you.  Here's your line of the day.  Here.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:52:00]  We've been emailing each other.  I don't think the Brady's email each other.  Yeah.  Except like, please stay away.  How much does he weigh today?  That was the last email they sent.  Oh, God.  It is kind of crazy.  Oh, that's not good.  Oh, obviously, when you see Saget on Broadway, you know, what did you say?  What was Bob's line? 
[03:52:30]  No, it was the ant tag.  Oh, where do I send the wreath?  Oh.  All right.  Hey, tomorrow, really fast.  Got to get this in.  Adult Stars, Brie Olsen and Caden Cross are coming in courtesy of AdamEve.com.  They got a special running right now.  If you go to AdamEve.com slash wow, you get 50% off almost any adult item.

Dr. Schoen.  Great.  Oh, you like my hair?  And I'd like to thank you guys.  Goodbye.  All right, Dave, listen.  We got to, we got to, I have a funny thing I say at the end of the show.  I'll say, you don't have to go home, but you can stay here.  You know, everybody laughs. 
[03:54:00]  They're practicing being cruel and unusual.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. </pre>
