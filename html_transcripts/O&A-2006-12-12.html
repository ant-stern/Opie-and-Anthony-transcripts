<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a vulgar, sexually suggestive bit involving a virus metaphor, featuring James Norton. The hosts then launched into a discussion about the perceived lack of New York Post radio coverage and their competition, transitioning into anecdotes about check-writing mishaps and alimony.  This segued into a darkly humorous discussion of a deceased couple found in a swamp, which further fueled morbid jokes and reflections on intrusive thoughts.  They promoted their upcoming Tonight Show appearance and their annual "Homeless Shopping Spree," detailing its chaotic nature and featuring a man with severe facial disfigurement nicknamed "Half a Hulk Face."  Listener calls contributed to the show's off-color humor, focusing on funerals and inappropriate thoughts.  A significant portion was dedicated to the controversy surrounding the removal and return of Christmas trees at a Seattle airport, prompting discussion on political correctness and religious sensitivities. The show concluded with a discussion of Santa Claus and a humorous audio clip of Opie telling a child that Santa doesn't exist. Throughout, the language was consistently crude and sexually suggestive.

The next segment focused on Nigeria's anti-gay legislation and various scams. The hosts expressed disbelief at the harsh punishments, while detailing common scams such as Nigerian email scams, counterfeit merchandise, and ticket scams. Callers shared their own scam experiences, including counterfeit camcorders, fake tickets, and counterfeit cashier's checks; one caller, Rotten Randy, even admitted to participating in scams.  The hosts also discussed phony job offers, lottery scams, and phishing. The segment featured the "MacBook Karaoke" contest, won by Tina Law, much to the chagrin of another contestant, Dave Calabria.  Finally, the hosts criticized New York City Councilman John Liu for his reaction to Rosie O'Donnell's comments about Danny DeVito, suggesting he focus on more pressing issues like the slave trade. The segment concluded with an interview with Tina Law.

The following segment centered on Rosie O'Donnell's "Ching Chang Chang" joke and John Liu's reaction, with a discussion on the double standard for public and private figures.  The conversation moved to celebrity mugshots (Nicole Richie, Mel Gibson, Yasmeen Bleeth, Rip Torn, and Nick Nolte) and a discussion of suicides shown on live television (including Bud Dwyer).  Callers Craig and Hillary contributed to the conversation, with Craig commenting on O'Donnell's hypocrisy. A significant portion involved an unscripted interaction with "Half a Hulk Face," a homeless man with a large facial tumor. The hosts engaged with him outside the studio, made light of his appearance, examined his tumor and ear canal, and offered him a spot on the "homeless shopping spree," discussing potential fundraising for surgery.  The segment ended with further discussion of "Half a Hulk Face" and graphic media clips.

A subsequent segment featured "Half a Hulk Face" as a studio guest, discussing his neurofibromatosis in a vulgar and sexually suggestive manner.  The hosts devised a plan to have him solicit money for photos on the street, using increasingly outrageous and offensive marketing tactics.  Their efforts were largely unsuccessful.  A caller discussed bad Verizon customer service, and another reported a radio station stealing the Opie and Anthony "Fatty Pig" contest.  A significant portion focused on a caller's story of a Verizon customer service representative struggling with basic arithmetic.  The segment concluded with "Half a Hulk Face" having his penis placed in a jar of peanut butter, followed by an intern eating it, and included several improvised sexually explicit songs.

The final segment detailed a street stunt involving "Half a Hulk Face," using increasingly aggressive and vulgar tactics to solicit money for his plastic surgery.  Insults such as "you cunt," "you asshole," and "I hope you get cancer" were repeatedly used.  The hosts and "Eric" encouraged various expressions and poses.  The stunt raised only $29. The hosts discussed their lack of success and mentioned a future "money snatch" event. The segment concluded with casual conversation and banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  Here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim until there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with pure rage, and then eventually everything just stops. 
[00:00:30]  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failures, the most annoying thing on two legs,  what a war fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee.  Opie.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance. 
[00:01:00]  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him, but with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And...  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Mom!  I'm not going to load.  I have to do this now.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Ah!  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  there you go some radio gold for you yeah montage totally lucked out on that one 
[00:02:00]  razzle dazzle razzle dazzle if anyone should be tasered  wake up with whooping razzle dazzle  fanny porter another one should be tasered  sounds like her hey good morning welcome to the opian anthony show the o-n-a virus spreading  across america on this fine two for tuesday what it is a tuesday i don't know about the two for part 
[00:02:30]  twice the laughs on the opian anthony show today ho ho our phone number one eight six six three  one three free one eight six six three one three free  god just a quick observation this is so stupid and it's but it's fast new york post they don't  really write about radio anymore because the guy that used to write for radio for the new york post 
[00:03:00]  now kind of runs the station we're on in new york city yeah john minelli so the guy like uh this guy  michael star that kind of writes about radio uh-huh and the best he could do the best he could do  we're in the number one radio market new york city new york city so you would think there's a lot of uh  great radio stories out there to discuss every day there must be some stellar story whoopee's got 
[00:03:30]  to be up to something apparently not uh uh uh uh uh well i can't even name another air personality  that's broadcast in new york city no you know we got our pal imus yeah we don't even know who we  compete against in uh new york no we really don't no clue and it's so broken up into races and  you can't even tell who you're broadcasting to yeah like there are some people we supposedly compete 
[00:04:00]  with yeah that their listeners would never ever listen to us not even on a chance because they  wouldn't understand what we're saying and vice versa do we compete against jim kerr i don't think so  how do you compete against the led zeppelin song early in the morning that's pretty much what's going  on over there jim kerr's a juggernaut juggernaut do we compete against uh scott and todd um i don't  think so they're doing the whole way hold on i'll compete against them personally all right  it's wacky it is wacky when you hear this sound you know i'm bringing the funny and i don't mean 
[00:04:30]  bringing with a g bring in and then a little comma the funny the funny that is another show  they don't even speak english i don't know if we're competing against them i don't even know if  they're talking bad about us they could be they could be who knows i didn't take spanish so i don't  know anyway uh i guess there's not much going on in new york radio because michael star decided 
[00:05:00]  that this item was so important it had to be in print this morning it just had to be there for  everybody must be important uh he writes it's no secret that q104's ken dashow is a huge beatles  fan his breakfast with the beatles show is a dead giveaway on the show this past sunday beatles  every radio station in america does that every every classic rock station in america does the  beatles gotten cheaper over the years it sure has well what i meant he said the bill's gotten cheaper 
[00:05:30]  over the years breakfast with the beatles two empty chairs one with pudding in front of the  i'll pick up the check now uh his breakfast with the beatles show is a dead giveaway on the show  this past sunday yeah he mentioned how last friday december 8th he wrote a check yeah and accidentally  dated it december 8th 1980 oh the day john lennon was murdered stop it he just didn't do that that 
[00:06:00]  is such a made-up thing i hope it was for his mortgage and he lost his house  check that just did not happen no it didn't but the radio uh bullcrap but that's the best thing  you're right about as far as new york radio goes today here in new york city that some dude that's  been just spinning records for 30 years wrote the wrong date on a check great yes on the anniversary 
[00:06:30]  of lennon's death i did something similar to that recently i wrote uh i wrote just 40 to uh commemorate  the death of caligula ah that'll happen just a big 40 on the date i uh i have a similar story  yeah i was writing uh one of my alimony checks to the ex-wife and instead of putting jennifer in  i put the c word it just  and i sent it out and might have signed it after i gave myself what is called the stink finger 
[00:07:00]  oh so it could happen oh you should do that oh i please i just stay out of trouble oh i'm one of  those guys i'm i'm like uh you know i'm like a shawshank i'm just doing my time trying to just  get through get out so i could hang myself and carve my name in a beam oh you should do is just  sign a bunch of checks yeah and and then just you know and then let uh good old bob just have bob 
[00:07:30]  send them out so you don't even know you're sending them anymore nah because there's little special  treats every time like i told you she's been writing things on the back right little messages  like under protest she writes on the back i guess so that when there's this gravy train  finally pulls into the station last stop last stop last stop uh ladies and gentlemen this is the last 
[00:08:00]  stop for the gravy train we're asking everybody to please uh leave the gravy train it's uh going into  storage uh this line will never be used again ever ever ever ever ever ever good luck to you good  luck to you hope you've been saving so i'm just thinking uh that's being written on the back  because you know who knows you might decide to do some kind of thing afterwards to keep uh keep things  going uh so i i write on the front of the check one day i just get annoyed at looking at this month after 
[00:08:30]  month or so i write on the front dear bank teller if under protest is written on front of on back of check  do not cash so so written on the back is with prejudice no i'm not kidding you she is nuts 
[00:09:00]  i don't understand under protest and i understand because because i i guess some lawyer and her lawyer  being dominic barbara uh decided what you could do is sign it and put under protest because  the just mere act of cashing the check would lead somebody to believe that you are accepting it  in good faith if you write under wait i gotta eat something hold on 
[00:09:30]  wait i gotta get married again hold on oh wait i gotta get divorced again hold on  yeah so i guess by by writing that it even though you're cashing it you're saying hey  i don't agree with this so later on she doesn't agree with the whole shenanigans oh to get more  to get more money perhaps oh my god she doesn't agree with the amount that you're giving her every  month no holy crap no holy crap and i've been i've been you know letter of the law here with 
[00:10:00]  this thing i've been really good believe me better than i could be tell you the truth without getting  into uh details because there are you know things in the uh settlement that i'm not supposed to talk  about but without getting into details i've been better with this than i'm even supposed to be  so you know someone could be in for a rude awakening if an assessment is done let's  just say that how much time is left uh let me see dude you got divorced like a decade ago oh it 
[00:10:30]  was forever ago it has to be uh well let me see i got seven years ago i think 1999 right the whole  shindig got started and then uh three and a half years later nine years nine years something like that  what do you mean nine years i have to deal with it for nine years oh okay i was like married for nine  years so you're getting there yeah getting close but you weren't officially divorced of like two  years after the the whole process started it yeah but it doesn't matter it was like right when it's 
[00:11:00]  the whole thing started oh so you're almost there yeah it's getting close believe me less than two  years yeah yeah yeah oh my god do you realize i know thank god do you realize the raise you're gonna  guess oh do you realize the raise you're gonna get out of nowhere oh believe me i realize oh do i  realize how nice that first you're gonna be skipping down the sidewalk la la la la la la la can i suggest 
[00:11:30]  that the day you're done with that you want to get a limo and you and your chick ought to drive  in front of her house and bang in the limo in front of the house and drive away perfect idea  why do it in a limo in front of the house when i've done it in the house  just throw a little trash out the window how do you think this whole thing got started  ah well yeah that'll happen she allowed it though what the hell throw a few dollars out the window 
[00:12:00]  ask her to come out and just throw a pittance of cans here you go here you go hope you don't  have to get up for work early remember work anyway the big uh story today the uh the missing couple  in north carolina oh wow found this coming found dead in a swamp you're kidding how did this happen  does everyone know the story by now that i was just talking to yeah this was a national story yeah  this couple uh decided they were going to come to new york what to see that dumb christmas tree 
[00:12:30]  no is uh they they visit visiting their family for the holidays in queens for the holidays yeah  for uh for for uh hanukkah hasn't hanukkah started i don't happy hanukkah i think it started i'm not  sure i don't know what uh denomination they were all right i don't know what religious background  well they came up here early so what it was a it was a a husband and wife and a little girl  no i just heard husband and wife a couple oh okay uh coming to see their their adult children  or their adult daughter or whatever and they would they would do it every year and then like 
[00:13:00]  they just didn't get in here from by the next day and they're like there's a problem yeah and you  knew they were dead i mean there's no way you you know for this north carolina or south carolina  here's 12 hour drive well what else could happen now you know and then and and they she said her  father everything was like clockwork with him and uh you know always making phone calls to them to  let them know how things are going and well they didn't get too far no they started myrtle beach and uh they  found them in a swamp off i-95 in north carolina yeah so they didn't get too far they uh were only  a few hours into the drive i always think of such morbid things too like my mind is morbid when when 
[00:13:30]  i can't look at morbid pictures or anything but my mind will just concoct these morbid scenarios  and and all i could think of was they didn't make it too far so there had to be points what happened is  they went off the road it must have been sleepy right sleepy whatever it was they they veered off the road  uh over a little embankment into a swamp where the car was submerged and they died in the car  uh drown or whatever uh and i'm thinking it was so soon after they left that there had to be a point 
[00:14:00]  where the daughter is sitting there just going you know looking at the clock on oh they must be in jersey  by now they must be in jersey and then all all the reality is is that that eerie underwater scene  of two people bobbing in a front seat of a car you know just kind of  just bobbing there for hours the cell phone they're trying to call like floating against the roof of the car 
[00:14:30]  probably ringing little fish little fish swimming around pecking just they're just pecking doing their job  just getting a taste like this yeah as they you know how they kind of look at things fish and then  bink bink bink and and she's probably should be any minute now i should have called though what's the  just hands gently gently with the current bobbing up and down glazed over eyes looking into the water 
[00:15:00]  through the windshield you're a creep man it's just a horrible thing i know what you mean like you're  like are they like where are they i wonder what part but they're dead they're already dead it's  dead just dead it's horrific that's the end of that story think of that too at funerals i get like  these morbid thoughts when they they you know open casket you look and they fix them up and everything  and then you wonder how long it takes before what i call the jaw drop where you see you see it in all 
[00:15:30]  the awful zombie movies and and and like movies where they got to open up a tomb and the jaw isn't  nice and shut like it was at the funeral it's like crooked and dropped down to the neck it's like when  did the jaw at some point in that casket the jaw just went drunk you know like broke away and kind  of the jaw drop even better as you're describing that yeah someone's jaw dropped someone's jaw just  dropped in a hole somewhere in the ground could have been buried in 1960s whatever could have 
[00:16:00]  been i don't know a month ago something happened their jaw just goes and they have that now horrific  monster look for the for the rest of time for eternity for eternity you know creeps people out of  the wake if they're all looking at the body and you go oh they look so good if you look at all them  and then jam your hand down the person's pants and go yeah they feel good too oh jeez what the hell  is wrong with you it's horrid you just get morbid thoughts like that i don't know why what happened 
[00:16:30]  if i tip the coffin over yeah you ever get those stupid thoughts of what if i did this and they say  the line between sanity and sanity is is that sane people think that but don't do it and insane people  will do certain things that are crazy but sane people do think that you think most people think  yeah yeah it's i don't know if it's a way of dealing with it or it's just part of human nature  to to you know that we have this intelligence that animals don't have and part of that intelligence is 
[00:17:00]  coming up with these strange imagined scenarios at funerals weddings things like that i've been at  weddings where i have you know loved the couple and thought what would happen what would be the  follow-up if i walked up and punched the bride in the face as hard as i could and just  laid her out right there and started laughing like would they just look at me with with the  groom start beating me up with the best man with what would the mother of the bride would she start  crying like i just play the whole scenario out i i do i'm bored crapless i do that on the streets 
[00:17:30]  of new york like i'll all of a sudden get the urge to just just punch someone really hard in the face  but it's never really anything more than an old lady or something it's not like i'd punch that guy  in the face and start a fight it's something so out there like you see a fragile old lady and go  i bet i could crack her jaw right off her head in one punch her jaw would be on the ground you ever  like have those thoughts and then and then think to yourself thank god no one can read my mind right 
[00:18:00]  now because you're like i'm i'm freaking insane crazy i'm thinking about cracking that old lady  over the head right right in the head just as hard as i could i want to i want to pop her in the face  and then as quick as you think that it's gone the thought's over and now you're walking into starbucks  to get a i don't know a cappuccino and throw it in someone's face right it is i don't know where  they come from but it's not always hurtful like i went to a party like my girlfriend did a a set last 
[00:18:30]  night she was performing at a just awful christmas party and it was really uncomfortable and i'm in  the back and she's like you know i didn't want you to watch and you know whatever and i'm thinking  what would happen if i just walked up and stood right in front of her and smiled oh god while she  was performing and made her uncomfortable what would unfold after how angry at me would she be  yeah it's like playing it out what would happen and then you get embarrassed yeah yeah it's like oh  would that be awful oh that was so hard why do you put yourself through that i don't know i know  my sister used to do uh in school she used to have a little dance recitals and she'd be all you 
[00:19:00]  know dressed up in her little uh stuff that she'd get up on stage with and do a little dance recital  with the rest of the class yeah and i would think even back then as a kid what would happen if i ran  up on stage and did a goofy version of their dance in front of everybody and and i would just sit there  thinking it and going and then you get all embarrassed like oh my god people just freak out and think i was  retarded and i think every person listening to us now they have those uh these thoughts 
[00:19:30]  yeah some are a little crazier than others but in general you just want to just disrupt  yeah yeah disrupt disrupt things a little bit disrupt someone's day or just embarrass yourself  or just be an idiot patrice is a very funny bit on it and then the term he's using it is called  intrusive thinking oh you see his bit on that it's not very good though intrusive thinking and he's  done it before but he said he's holding a baby and he goes and there's a part and then all of a  sudden i'm just going slam the baby on the floor or however he phrases it but he's holding the baby 
[00:20:00]  and he's like i have to give the baby back it's a really funny bit but it's like man that is the  absolute truth slam the baby on him or spike the baby i think it was something like a football  reference i forget what it was because i have to hand the baby back to the lady  you can't be you can't get this wrong people it's not like i would ever do anything  it would never get done and everyone's agreeing yeah everyone's agreeing you ever have a crazy  one like one time i was uh i was at a wedding and i said eat the salad with the dinner fork 
[00:20:30]  crazy person you know how silly you'd look yeah silly this is what we're gonna do phones are just  lit people are yeah so we'll go with this a little longer hanukkah december 15th at sundown thank  is it what's the date and uh speaking of hanukkah we got an update on those uh trees at the seattle  airport oh remember they took down the tree yes at the airport uh we got some good news to report  on that after the update it's the opie and anthony show opie and anthony will be appearing on the

[00:28:30]  normally think of something and this guy took it to like you know and then i could do it and he had  dialogue written down you know it would be uh good but if you don't have material it wouldn't be funny  i had blocking and everything like like i was gonna walk up to the blocking punch bowl to the punch  bowl at the at the wake and like have him take a bath and sing and do all this other sort of stuff  and i started chuckling and my wife turned to me and said what's so funny i'm like that kid is a  ventriloquist dummy and she just looked at me like i'm the worst person in the world well she  probably didn't understand what you were saying sir yeah very good thank you bill lunatic you know 
[00:29:00]  what i think of every day and uh because i've seen photos of people who try to stop elevators like  when you try to stop an elevator door yeah i've once in a while they will close on you so never do  that i saw a photo of a guy who had been caught in the elevator and the elevator just took him up and  ripped him in half and there was a woman on the elevator that had to ride with half of his body oh yeah  and um i don't think she was joking no no no she was talking to the head making little wacky jokes  where's your body huh on floor but i uh i always think like i want to put my leg out in the elevator 
[00:29:30]  door when it closes like what would happen as it's closing on my leg if the elevator started going  up i'd fall backwards would i would i kick my one foot against before my other foot got ripped off  i keep i have to like actually walk to the back of the elevator now because i want to put my leg in  it you and but then you have a contingency plan just in case it happens no i don't i would get  my leg ripped off oh i thought you would kick it out i'll try but it wouldn't work that's the same  type of stuff like when you're you know up high and you get that feeling you just want to jump and 
[00:30:00]  stuff and it creeps you out that you even have that feeling and you're like oh my god what i don't  want to jump any of these ideas you have the actual power to do them right there's nothing that  stops you physically uh from doing these things it's just your own mental state that keeps you  from doing it but you get that creepy feeling like oh my god i think i almost i think i almost jumped i  don't want to die i i had i i almost did it i can't even control it it's just that it's it's 
[00:30:30]  horrible because it's possible yeah you can go up and tip a casket over right rob on long island what's  up hey i'm when i'm driving my wife to the morning commute like i just think what if i just pulled  the emergency brake yeah and like uh just ended our lives yeah it could happen that easily something  you do as a kid though in your car i've done that first couple of cars you own you just wailing down  the highway and pull your emergency brake what happened just go skid you go skidding down the road 
[00:31:00]  just usually locks up your rear wheels wow and then you just skid you did it on a highway not on a  highway no side streets you know you get up to about i don't know 35 40 and then and then pull it i  would never do it at like 60. what happens if you put it in park when you're driving i don't think you  can i really don't think you can you'd hear such a grind  i don't think you'd be able to do it i've thought of that so many times just put it in park  i won't do it because we need to stop that fast yeah well it would be funny to just stop no skidding 
[00:31:30]  let's go to jared in boston jared what's up hey boys stinky rules you guys have been playing  far far far too much grant that data you know yeah where you're able to do all these things it's funny  you say that because yesterday the video of the day was that guy that decided to steal the uh the uh  garbage truck yeah and then he kind of crashed it into a little pond or something a little lake  yeah lake after a big police chase i'm watching that video going wow i did that exact same scenario 
[00:32:00]  on gta recently yeah you just grab that or a big bus right just because you can and see what it could  do they're throwing spike strips at you you don't care let's go to jeff in philly listening to us on  wysp jeff what's up all right hey did jeff the big setup and you're not there jeff jeff from philly  all right we're moving on hey uh that airport in seattle with the christmas trees well that rabbi  we were on this story yesterday's stupid rabbi didn't see a menorah saw a lot of christmas trees 
[00:32:30]  and and started bitching and complaining and wanted equal time or else he was gonna sue and the airport  got rid of the christmas trees in seattle the rabbi did say in the news he said that he didn't want  the trees it wasn't to get the trees taken down yeah but the thing is he said it wasn't to get the  trees taken down it was to get a menorah put up the airport's version was hey if we put a menorah up  we're going to be open to all kinds of different cultures wanting their symbols up and we're running  an airport here we don't have time for you know to to worry about uh individual cultures and the 
[00:33:00]  holidays so they said the easiest solution because then the rabbi threatened to sue was look we can't go  through litigation we got to remove these christmas trees and no one will have anyone  yeah well the rabbi got a lot of hate mail i'm sure he did he got a ton of hate mail his lawyer  saying look he like uh jimmy said uh you know he didn't want the christmas trees mel signed mel kipson  he wanted a menorah added to the uh the airport and uh his lawyer said we're not part of the war on  christmas the war on christmas yeah this war on christmas thing started yeah with the happy 
[00:33:30]  holidays instead of merry christmas all that crap all we asked for was inclusion and now we're getting  hate mail and angry messages well today uh seattle airport brings back the christmas trees  good yay bringing back the christmas trees but the rabbi's people called you all right look we're  getting death threats could you throw the trees back up we'll shut our faces exactly they probably  were there's some uh crazy uh catholics and christians out there i looked walmart is finally doing uh 
[00:34:00]  a merry christmas this year again because uh i mean the catholic league gets irritating sometimes but  they boycott i guess you get people just get tired of the political correctness of happy holidays  yeah and it really is all just about political correctness there should be you know a a limit  if you have a if you you represent a certain percentage of the population then you're allowed  if you're just this little group then go screw like the menorah that's fine put the christmas trees 
[00:34:30]  up put a menorah up there are plenty of jews in this country uh that want to participate put the  menorah up fine but then if you get some friggin group that's out of from out of space somewhere  that wants their symbol hung up yeah go screw you don't represent enough of this country they want  they want a display of uh like clean sneakers hanging yeah those the uh behind the spaceship  behind the comet people that's right yeah yeah no they're all gone they're all gone yeah thanks god  kwanzaa and like islam it's i mean islam is a really old religion kwanzaa is kind of new i don't 
[00:35:00]  know anything about it but like when you guys have when there's fun presents associated with  those things yeah people wouldn't mind seeing it's an enjoyable holiday right when it's hacking  people's heads off well ramadan they don't eat it's like it's like i don't know what they're like  christmas equalism in in islam but it's like it doesn't seem like it'd be a fun present oriented  thing does anyone know what that is i'm sure is it fun well i doubt it i don't know is there a 
[00:35:30]  muslim equivalent to christmas like there is the jews have hanukkah like and that because i want to  know like jimmy brings up a good point is it fun because i've i've not heard of one muslim holiday  that includes anything fun it's all about yeah suffering fasting and suffering and and hitting  yourself and you know i and giving yourself bad knees yeah you gotta kneel down i gotta tell you but  but you can stretch out your lower back nicely yeah that seems to be what they're doing muslims 
[00:36:00]  equal good yoga i mean no one's arguing but what what and kwanzaa is the same thing and every other  religion that nobody wants to acknowledge like in the airport like that yeah there's nothing fun  associated with it well there i don't think there's a kwanzaa um symbol like like you know you got  christmas you got the christmas tree and santa claus things like that uh hanukkah of course the menorah  uh i don't think kwanzaa has like this symbol that uh you know you can hang up i don't know that'll 
[00:36:30]  say oh that's kwanzaa i don't know i don't know either who cares uh they're not uh there's no uh  plans to put the menorah in the airport no as of now but the christmas trees are back in seattle  thank goodness what's this fun what's after menorah i mean i don't wouldn't mind them putting  menorah up because yeah what's like the third religion yeah like the chinese is a million  chinese here but like i don't know what they're i mean chinese new year gets a lot of is it a stupid 
[00:37:00]  dragon and firecrackers well they don't seem to mind though they have their own new year they just  want to run down the street and cause a ruckus once a year firecrackers at their feet oh it's the year  of the turtle is it yeah what's that all right let's do this today what's that on my calendar what's the  top five christmas displays christmas yeah we got the christmas tree we got i'm or around the  christmas holiday because they you know like hanukkah starts on the 15th i would say the christmas tree  is number one yeah uh yeah has to be but sorry to all the jews out there is santa claus santa claus 
[00:37:30]  well all right i'm just talking about one symbol per like religion basically basically christmas  christmas tree christmas tree lit up you know it's christmas menorah for hanukkah what's that what's  what's in third place i don't even think we can get to five there's a big drop off right there  i i know kwanzaa does something i think is it a bush i don't know is it a bush right is it a bush or  something is it an afro bush afro you're shaving the chia pet shaved into a big link from the mod squad 
[00:38:00]  afro let's go to jeff in fort lee jeff yeah what's up hello jeff what's up kwanzaa's uh kwanzaa  it's almost it's almost like menorah all right what's associated with kwanzaa gift wise and fun wise  i didn't hear you what happened oh goodbye 
[00:38:30]  maulid al nabi is that the um celebration of muhammad's birth  includes um what do they do though includes sermons gift giving and a feast muhammad's birth  is that around christmas time when does that be a hell of a coinkydink when's muhammad's birth when  is it uh it's on uh anyone know fan uh yeah it's uh uh december um um can't be 
[00:39:00]  just can't be well someone said christ is over the summer anyway technically he was born like july  or august or what blaspheme blaspheme it's not it's december 25th christmas day that's right  the little drummer boy right i have no gifts to bring  that's fit to give our king  the stupid kid gives him a song he didn't even give him the drum 
[00:39:30]  he gave him a song you know something he said he's got nothing to give you got the drum  that's right give jesus the drum he wanted to play for christ right he's like can i play mary nods  the ox and the lamb kept time which is silly tapping their dirty hooves in their own waist  cloven hooves you ever see a lamb try to tap its hoof in its own waist it's not very musically helpful 
[00:40:00]  other people are giving uh gold frankincense and myrrh yeah and he's giving a stupid what is some  myrrh when was the last time you unwrapped and went oh myrrh oh thanks thanks grandma  it was on my list and you got it for me i got some myrrh i didn't get myrrh this year  shiny myrrh got some underwear socks look myrrh the answer's not food stamp by the way  you asses you racist asses the big brick of government cheese 
[00:40:30]  greg of long island what's up how you doing hey  the uh the symbol for uh kwanzaa is a sideways handgun  it's not the sideways why during this festive holiday season do we have to resort to such hatred  can't we all just get along uh david smithtown what's up  merry christmas everybody merry christmas happy holidays  kwanzaa symbol which he just took my thunder was a black man in a ski mask  stealing a hanukkah sign from a jewish person 
[00:41:00]  oh my god what is wrong with you guys  it is not  inappropriate bell is gonna get all worn out today  yes we know christmas is a national holiday not just a religious holiday we know that  yeah by the way they do it uh in uh they make they pc up the little drummer boys song too  because a lot of versions is baby jesus but another version is little baby  really yeah like they don't want anybody i don't know why that would be offensive to somebody  baby jesus yeah oh i'm looking at some myrrh 
[00:41:30]  you wow is a red brown uh resinous material the dried sap of the tree comifora merah  what is little jesus to do with that native to somalia and the eastern parts of ethiopia  oh the sap of a number of other comifora and balsam modendron species are known as myrrh  i got myrrh one time oh wait yes i opened up a package it was gavin mcleod  myrrh is uh constituent of perfumes and incense 
[00:42:00]  was highly prized in ancient times  myrrh  i'm giving myrrh  myrrh  myrrh  mary  i'm giving you myrrh  loo  loo  here's some merloo  with some merlo  merloo  merlo  okay pookie  did you get that ow  okay give him the mer pookie

[00:43:00]  oh so the gold was like third on the list  yeah i guess  what about frankincense  what is that  some type of incense  a scented candle shaped like john kerry  let's say hi to matt in boston matt what's up  no i'm like dude um i think the ramadan thing is just like kwanzaa except it's like a wooden like menorah and they light like green red and black candles 
[00:43:30]  it's still clear and pointless though  is there some type of like almost menorah thing to it  they said it's like wood  ah  so they sit when people are having christmas and getting gifts they carve a thing out of wood  all right  when other people are having fun  yeah right  they're carving wood  can we get one lousy shwoogie to call us and tell us what's uh what's up with kwanzaa and what the symbol is for kwanzaa  jesus  uh rob in long island what's up  jesus

[00:48:30]  but you get deeper  there's like seven video clips up on opieandanthony.com  from money snatch 2002  good representation  uh yeah six and seven are really really good  basically we get very  uh we get uh desperate girls  that need money  really badly  so they can get their christmas gifts  holiday season  and then we get them uh completely naked  and then we throw them  in the studio  among other naked girls  and they fight for money  that's all over the studio  kind of like the bank vault game 
[00:49:00]  that the dumb morning zoos do  but we do it with our own twist  they have to be naked  and fighting amongst each other  and they pick up as much money as they can  and then they uh  at the end of the allotted time  they get to keep the money  that they were able to gather up  but oh yes that's right  they can't be carrying the money in their hands  when they leave the studio  right  also we have a leaf blower  i was just watching a video  and leaf blower is hilarious  and then there's another clip  with uh money attached to jimmy's cross  what was that 
[00:49:30]  i don't remember  did you do that  i'm sure  so go to opieandanthony.com  and uh i guess you gotta click on  tuesday's links  and then you'll see  uh the money snatch video clips  okay  symbols of kwanzaa  they have many  is what it comes down to  and it kind of looks like a menorah  yeah that kind of  kind of looks like a menorah  it has the uh candle holder  with seven candles  it has a cup  a cupeth  it has uh  it has the crops  which are the mazao  mazao  makeka

[00:50:30]  axed  this is a terrific story  before we move on from  talking about the holiday  a primary school  sacked a woman teacher  for telling heartbroken  nine-year-olds  there is no father christmas  oh father christmas  must be uh  uh english story  why  because that's what they call him over there  father christmas  instead of santa claus  oh wait  father christmas  yeah yeah  yeah right  the kinks right  oh yeah you're right  yeah 
[00:51:00]  so they call it father christmas over there  the thing is they're so stiff over there  they can't even have a fun name for them  like sanny claus  sanny claus  they gotta call it father christmas  then  santa claus  hello  is a creep  it came from saint nicholas  saint nicholas  saint nicholas  saint nicholas  oh  just kind of  bastardized into santa claus  oh  that was the best job i ever had  was a mall sanny claus  yeah uncle paul 
[00:51:30]  yeah  you're bouncing on your knee  wait one for christmas  and they would tell you  yeah  get their addresses  stop it mister  you're not supposed to be taking down children's addresses  well you want to get the right kids the right gifts  oh is that your reasoning  okay  creep  a primary school sacked a woman teacher  for telling heartbroken nine-year-olds 
[00:52:00]  there is no father christmas  parents were furious  when tearful youngsters went home  saying they had also been taught  elves and fairies did not exist either  well not elves  especially in england  jesus  half the country  speaking of fairies  get that nigerian story  the story  oh yeah  we'll do that in a second  we have a lot in common  what  we have a lot in common with nigeria  apparently  well  based on the story  we're part of it  it's good to know we still have some freedom still in america 
[00:52:30]  yeah a little bit  just when you think all our freedoms are being taken away  you get a nice story out of nigeria  we'll get into that in a second  the supply teacher  you owe me money by the way  I got an email  I don't want to let the cat out of the bag  but a few million coming my way from nigeria  enough said  you're going to be retiring soon  yep that's right  you don't need to do this anymore  the supply teacher in her 30s  had her contract terminated  after complaints to the head  mum  Amanda P.O. Vassana  30 said her daughter was shocked to be told 
[00:53:00]  you are old enough to know there's no Santa or fairies  if you ask your parents  they will also say there's no such thing  good for her  are you kidding me  no  Amanda said it's taking away the magic  the mum of another pupil  at Boldmere Junior School  in Sutton  Codfield  West Midland  said  everyone is disgusted  and head  Diane Thomas Wood  confirmed  we have followed up the matter  with the agency  all crying 
[00:53:30]  dressed like  what's his name there  from ACDC  Angus Young  just like Angus Young  all crying  running out of the school  mom  a classroom filled with Angus Young  teacher said there's no Father Christmas  there there  there there now  little velour suits and hats  the little hats that all it needs is the propeller on it  little knee high  slacks  nickers  little nickers  tell me there's a Father Christmas mum

[00:54:30]  like there's  eight or nine days  it's like  and there's a Kwanzaa song  I can't remember the name of it  it's like  kind of like a  soulful hip-hop song  it's like a hip-hop  soulful  it shouldn't be hip-hop  Christmas song  is it true  Bob Marley invented Kwanzaa  no  no that's not true  but it is a  it is a  it is a holiday of the harvest  and it's kind of like  you know  African harvest  and it's kind of not really  an African holiday  it's more like  you know  the most liberal  parents of the holiday  yeah why the hell 
[00:55:00]  did you guys invent that  only a few years ago  Christmas wasn't good enough  nah Christmas too white  definitely too white  and you don't give gifts  that's what the whole thing is  yeah it's around  too much commercialism  and stuff  and  you get together  and then pretty much  you just like  you don't give gifts  because you're too busy  stealing them  oh  that isn't  it's the holiday  time of year  Opie  only in Nassau County  yeah  uh oh  alright Bill

[00:59:30]  it was the wife  in the background  doing a yeep yeep yeep yeep  yeah she did  now that I remember  she was getting  a little ragged  you tell him  a little ragged  alright  going back to the tape  alright  where's Jeffrey  I'll get him.  He don't really talk much on the phone, but...  What's your wife saying in the background?  She wasn't too happy about it when I told her.  She wasn't listening, but...  Wait, wait.  Chill out.  Chill out.  Okay, hey, Jeffrey, somebody wants to talk to you on the phone?  Those guys we were listening to on the radio? 
[01:00:00]  I'm on the floor first.  He's got a measuring tape.  He said he's measuring the floor first.  And your wife is mad at me for doing that?  I better talk to him and then smooth it over.  Okay, well, here he is, okay?  I'll give him the phone, but I don't know if he'll talk.  All right.  Okay, here he is.  Here, Jeffrey, listen.  Listen to this guy on the radio.  He wants to talk to you.  Here.  Jeffrey, take it.  Come here.  Wait, let me get him on my lap.  Jeffrey, come here.  Come here.  Just listen to what this guy has to say to you. 
[01:00:30]  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  It's your dad.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Homeless.  I've been saying no like that for years now, and I forgot where it even came from.  Look, the reality, that kid is like 15 now, so don't get too pissed off, please. 
[01:01:00]  That is true.  Wow.  Where's little Jeffrey to come here and punch you in the head?  That's got to be at least 10 years old, at least.  Yeah.  At least.  Yeah, so relax.  Please relax just a little bit.  But she was yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.  Yip, yip, yip, yip.  And how stupid were the parents?  Oh, morons.  How stupid were the parents?  Morons.  Because we've always had this edge to us, so they knew what the show was about.  Oh, you're not going to do anything, are you?  Why would you take that chance?  What did they expect?  Hi, Jeffrey.  Yes, I was only playing around and stuff, and Santa's coming to your house, and everything's fine. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Now, that's something Matty Siegel would do.  Good old Matty Siegel.  Oh.  That's a Boston reference for the rest of the country.  What's up with Nigeria?  Well.  They don't like the Fagulas, huh?  No, apparently they have some of the same issues going on over there.  Who would know that we have here?  Lawmakers in Nigeria are debating a bill that would ban same-sex marriages.  So they have a lot of these same issues going on over there. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  End any form of association among gays, even sharing a meal at a restaurant.  Wow.  Can't they just ban certain foods?  How about no two people enjoying the same hot dog?  Big sausage.  A few in Nigeria's deeply closeted gay community have publicly opposed the legislation.  Yeah, you come out, and they throw you in jail, which proposes penalties of up to five years in prison, and is widely expected to pass. 
[01:02:30]  So it looks like everyone's happy in the end.  It's a way to keep homosexuals away from each other.  You put them in prison.  Put them in prison.  That'll work.  Engaging in homosexual acts is already illegal in Nigeria, with those convicted facing jail terms in the mainly Christian South.  And execution in the mainly Muslim North.  Hard to believe.  Again, showing how their tolerance and how it's nothing but a loving religion.  A wonderful religion.  It's based in love. 
[01:03:00]  And please, you know, execution.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  And the cops breaking the door down.  And you're like, ah.  Just hack your head off.  Especially if it wasn't a good one.  Let me hope for that.  I was aging.  Pack in three.  I'd die for that.  Great.  Other activities prohibited under the proposed law includes belonging to gay clubs, reading books, watching films, or accessing internet sites that promote homosexuality. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, Jim.  Why are you arresting me?  I'm only doing my job.  I'm a webmaster.  Look, this is foundrymusic.com.  It's found...  No, no.  It's not homosexuality.  Stop it.  Grr.  Grr.  How did your homos die?  It's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You can't put that in your mouth.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Oh, boy. 
[01:04:00]  Horana Yerima.  Horana Yerima.  A member of Nigeria's House of Representatives said he supported the proposed ban.  Social contact between gays should be limited, he said, because it might encourage behavior that is against our culture, against our religion.  And, wow, attitudes towards gays in Nigeria are typical across the continent.  I guess Africa doesn't like.  In neighboring Cameroon, Amnesty International says accusations of homosexuality and anti-gay laws have been used as weapons against political opponents. 
[01:04:30]  I guess they say, you know, they support gay causes and they get ousted or never elected in the first place.  Wow.  Not a very nice place.  Maybe they ought to go after the scammers over there in Nigeria.  Although, who the hell has fallen for that?  Who the hell has fallen for the Nigerian thing?  Has everyone gotten those? 
[01:05:00]  I want to see a show of hands.  Who has gotten the Nigerian scam emails?  Just about every person out there.  Everyone that has an email account.  Yeah, of course.  Who falls for them?  All right.  The first couple of times.  I'm sure there's a few.  There are people that actually go over there.  Go over there to collect their money.  Dopes.  And they bring money.  There's this misconception that the whole thing is based on email and you're supposed to email them your bank account, but that isn't even it. 
[01:05:30]  Like, they try to get you to send them actual cash saying that you've got to pay certain taxes or we need to arrange the shipment for the money that you're going to get.  There's these millions that you're going to get, so please send us, like, $100,000 so we can send you $10 million.  And people just send Nigerians $100,000 of their money.  I have no.  They shouldn't even be put in jail for that.  No.  I think the government should just track you, and if you're caught doing that, you should just be smothered.  You should be executed, right?  You have nothing decision-wise. 
[01:06:00]  How stupid are you to fall for some of that stuff?  And children have just found out that their parents have blown their entire life savings on these scams.  Have you ever fallen for a scam?  Never fell for a scam.  Came close once out of my own, like, greed and being naive at the time because it was right when camcorders first came out.  Well, I was falling for a scam.  We were here in the city.  I didn't fall for it, though.  Somebody that was with us did.  Oh, okay.  We were here in the city, and a black guy comes up with this box, and it looked like a camcorder box. 
[01:06:30]  And he goes, $100, man.  It's brand new.  It's right off the truck.  So this guy we were with goes, okay, all right, all right.  And everybody else in the group is like, oh, man, I wanted it.  So he couldn't get the money out fast enough.  And this guy gave the guy $100.  He hands over the camcorder, and it disappears.  This thing is wrapped in this plastic wrap that is so – it's like a tarp.  It's that thick.  So it took him really a long time to even open this and then realize that the pictures of the camcorder on this box, it was a box that was wrapped in like blue wrapping paper. 
[01:07:00]  And then I had pictures that were clipped out of the Wiz flyers, flyers from the Wiz, an electronics store.  And taped on there and then plastic wrapped over.  So it looked, and it was dark out, and it was kind of in a dark area, you know.  And this guy handed it over, and inside were rolled up New York Times, like a bunch of rolled up newspapers. 
[01:07:30]  Just to make it feel heavy or whatever, right.  Yeah.  And he was like, oh, man, I just got screwed.  You know what part of the problem is you want to believe?  Like it brings me back.  This is my most embarrassing moment, and, you know, I fell for a scam.  My college roommate, Buzzy, came to New York City for business or whatever, and Jordan just happened to be in town.  It's like, oh, wow, the Knicks and Jordan, let's go.  We didn't have tickets.  Like, hey, why don't we just freaking scalp?  Sure.  You know, so we go down to the Madison Square Garden, and they're all over the place, these guys. 
[01:08:00]  And we find a guy, he's offering, like, tickets, you know, relatively good seats for $100 a piece or whatever.  We're like, ah, why don't we splurge, man?  It's Jordan.  How many times are you going to get to see Jordan in your life, right?  So we're like, let me see the tickets.  So he brings us into, like, a bank area, like an ATM area.  Yeah.  To look at the tickets.  And I look at them, and I just wanted to believe, like, I saw the tickets.  It's embarrassing to say, but the printing was a little off, but I'm like, ah, you know, well, maybe the printing machine smeared a little bit. 
[01:08:30]  Ran a couple off a little wrong.  I think I knew that they were just counterfeit, but I wanted to believe we hand over the freaking money.  We're getting all excited for Jordan and the Knicks, and we get right up to the gate.  We're going through the turnstiles.  The guy takes the tickets.  He actually rips them, and at the last second, he looks at them and goes, ah, these are fake.  And then goes, come with me.  I guess there was a guy standing by, and we had him march down to the catacombs of Madison Square Garden in this little room with undercover cops, 
[01:09:00]  and they had a whole wall of pictures of guys and, like, which one?  Which one?  Which one?  Which one?  And we knew exactly, like, oh, it was him.  And then they had a name for him, like Scratchy or whatever the hell his name was.  He would have gone, ah, when are we going to be able to see the game, sir?  I'm missing the game.  I was thinking that.  I was thinking that, you know, that they felt sorry for you.  Scratchy. 
[01:09:30]  So they at least gave you, like, nosebleed seats or something.  Oh, no.  Or because we went down to the catacombs and we pointed out the guy, we're going to at least get our money back.  So we point, yeah, it was him.  And they're like, oh, Scratchy's still at it.  And they made a note, like, all right, we got to, you know, take Scratchy out again.  Keep an eye out to Scratchy.  And then all of a sudden they just showed us a door.  We opened the door thinking, I don't know, we're going somewhere to get our other ticket.  Meh, meh, meh.  It's just outside.  Dude, we walked around, man. 
[01:10:00]  I mean, I wasn't making much money back then.  Buzzy wasn't making much money back then.  We were so depressed, man.  $100 is so much freaking money.  What bar did you go to?  We went to a local bar.  Of course you did.  Right around the guard in some awful bar and just watched the game and barely talked to each other.  We were so bummed.  But we wanted to believe it.  I think that's part of the scam.  That is a total, that's all the scam, is people want to believe that this is the thing that's going to make them rich.  Did you wonder why Nix was spelled N-I-X? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Dude, you know, someone could have made a mistake.  Honestly, now that I look back, it was so bad.  I'm like, why?  So obvious.  Why did we do that?  It almost looked like a typewriter.  I'm not even kidding.  I like to, you know, make it sound like, oh, wow, they really got me.  Great job.  Because I'm tough.  It was like, it was.  Like Scratchy's in a clean room with laser printers.  Right.  With a mask on and gloves, printing up these perfect replicas.  No, he just.  He's there with the typewriter.  A typewriter that doesn't even have the K that works anymore. 
[01:11:00]  There's white out on it.  Right, right.  Seats that don't exist.  Just awful.  You ever get scammed there, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, you did.  You don't get your money back either.  No.  Okay.  You're wearing a dress.  Oh, gee.  Finish up.  I don't know if I've ever been scammed.  I don't know.  I think that's the only one I could think of.  I don't think I've ever been scammed with any of that other stuff.  I'm very savvy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a doubting Thomas. 
[01:11:30]  You're naive people, though, that really want to believe.  I earned those tickets.  Those tickets.  Thank you, Sean, from PA.  But I want to see Jordan.  Jordan.  All right.  Oh, MacBook karaoke.  We got some terrific ones today.  Yeah, good entries.  Yesterday was pretty funny.  Yeah.  We'll get to today's entries in just a bit here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:12:00]  Coming soon to a snooty mall, maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas  presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless  shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right! 
[01:12:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  What's up with everybody?  Hope you're enjoying the show today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Taking over the world slowly but surely.  Your job, if you like the show, tell somebody about it.  Start some of that water cooler talk.  Oh, you had to be listening to Opie and Anthony this morning. 
[01:13:00]  You're not going to believe what they did.  Yeah, fuck a bunch of girls with their clothes on.  All right, we got some phones here.  Yes, we got Fernando in Jersey.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  Fernando, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, what's up, boy?  Hey.  Hey, yeah, I got scammed a couple years ago, man.  Remember when VCRs, like when they're first coming out, that was like $300, $400?  Yeah.  Man, I remember me and my boys, we was walking down the streets of Jersey, and this dude, 
[01:13:30]  he had like these boxes, and he had a VCR display and outside and everything.  And he was like, yo, $50, $50.  And we was like, oh, man, man, we got to get this, we got to get this, you know?  We got it.  And stupid of us, we didn't check out the box until we got home.  We opened the box, there was rocks.  Rocks, bricks.  Rocks.  Yeah, bricks piled in there.  Yeah, that's a famous one.  Yeah, man, I mean, we was pissed off, because one of my boys even bought a movie before  we got home. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, not all excited to watch his movie?  Yeah, we bought, I remember it was Lethal Weapon 2 when it first came out on video.  Yeah, oh, that sucks.  Yeah, man, we were like, oh, yeah, man, this is supposed to be the best Lethal Weapon ever,  you know?  We got home, rocks.  Oh, that's a bummer.  All right, Fernando, thank you.  I got beat buying drugs a couple of times, but that doesn't, that's not, I don't count  I thought it was a scam.  Yeah, that just happens.  That's just what happens.  Yeah.  Yeah, I never got scammed, though.  Like I said, I came close. 
[01:14:30]  If I would have been able to get my hundred out faster than the other guy, I would have,  you know, probably would have got it, please.  Holding those newspapers.  You got scammed.  I do.  Yeah, that's true.  I got scammed.  I'm still paying.  You fell for the biggest scam of all, marriage.  Hey, Rotten Randy.  Hey, how you doing?  Is this you, Rotten Randy?  I love you, Jimmy.  Hi, thank you.  What's going on?  Hey, Ope, Andy, Rotten Randy from Linton, Indiana, man. 
[01:15:00]  All right, what up?  Hey, listen, man, I was riding freight trains with the FTRA, all right?  And you might have seen me on Most Wanted.  Yes.  But anyways, partners, listen now.  Is this the gold rush?  Jesus.  I was smoking that crack out there in California, right?  Yeah.  And got in with the black dudes, right?  So anyways, we was wrapping up doggone DVD players with nothing inside of them, but a bunch of rocks. 
[01:15:30]  And it was just an empty case.  And then we'd sell it to the Mexicans, and they'd give us a bunch of rocks for them.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right, Rotten Randy.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  It's the same scams coming in.  We want to hear from some other ones.  Steve in West Palm Beach, what's up?  Hey, Owen.  How you doing, guys?  Pretty good, Steve.  Got a good story for you.  Put a boat for sale on an online boat selling organization. 
[01:16:00]  Guy contacts me from England.  He's a boat buyer.  He offers me $50,000 full price for the boat, plus sends me $4,600 for his buying agent to come and get the boat.  He gives me a Commerce Bank cashier's check.  I deposit the check at another major bank.  They clear the check.  Send the dues $4,600.  Two days later, they find out the counterfeit check, and they kick me out of the bank, freeze all my accounts.  Holy crap.  And it's going on right now in West Palm Beach, and I'm suing Wycovia Bank. 
[01:16:30]  What do they want from you?  They want the $4,600 back, and they want me out of the bank because they said I was in collusion with these Nigerian scammers.  Oh, they were Nigerian?  Apparently, because they traced it back.  I called the FBI in West Palm Beach.  Take care of Les.  They said it's not an FBI agent.  It just happens too much now with the Internet.  I wouldn't do anything.  When I buy stuff off the Internet, it's pretty much things like Best Buy, Circuit City, Amazon, things like that. 
[01:17:00]  I'm not getting some kind of a weird thing from eBay where you've got to send the funds to Nigeria.  You feel pretty good that it's safe, right?  Yeah.  I mean, everyone's doing their holiday holiday.  Jesus, I'm even saying their Christmas shopping online.  Yeah, online.  A lot of people.  I've been doing it for years.  Do holiday shopping or any kind of shopping online.  Anytime I'm buying videos, DVDs, things like that, I do it on Amazon.  Just go there and buy them the next day or two days later. 
[01:17:30]  It's right there at your door.  How can Nigeria pull off all these computer scams and yet they can't seem to get a vehicle after 1960?  Everything they drive is 1960 or before and yet they're all computer geniuses.  Yeah, computer geniuses.  They're able to spam like millions of people every day with these scam emails.  How about you figure out a way to feed people who live there?  How about that? 
[01:18:00]  Why don't you start there?  Who would fall for this one?  This is a phony job scam.  Scammers are increasingly responding to job seekers posting their resumes online, like career builders, places like that.  So they find these people and offer them a job on the spot as a courier.  They're instructed to receive a large check and deposit that check into their personal account. 
[01:18:30]  So now your boss tells you, yeah, you're going to get a check.  I want you to put it in your personal bank account.  How large?  $10,000?  It could be any amount.  Could be any amount.  Could be any amount.  So if the boss hands you the check for, let's say, $10,000 and says deposit in your own account.  I doubt they hand them the check.  They probably like mail it to them.  There's probably no real, like you never see these people.  Okay.  So deposit it in your personal account. 
[01:19:00]  Then they're instructed to wire the money to an account out of the country.  The checks, of course, are counterfeit, but they aren't exposed until after they've deposited it and the victims wired their money.  And it's their own money at this point because the bad check, once it bounces, it comes out of your account.  And you're out that money.  You're screwed.  Why would you do that?  But there's another scam, like this lottery ticket scam, where people come up to you and say they're illegal aliens or they're – for some reason, they won the lottery, but they can't cash the ticket because they don't have a social security number. 
[01:19:30]  ID or whatever, yeah.  If you – it's for $10,000, so if you could give me like three grand or something – because usually they have other people working with them.  So they'll gather up like five people, let's say, and four of those people are in on the scam.  One person isn't.  So they'll say this is for $10,000 and could you help me out? 
[01:20:00]  They go, I got – these four people that are going to go to the bank, give me $2,000, and then I'll give you guys the ticket.  You could cash it and split it and people – or usually it's for like $20,000, so they're making more money.  And since they see other people are involved and it looks on the up and up, they go, withdraw two grand, give it to this person, and that's it.  You never see any money.  You get this lottery ticket that isn't worth anything. 
[01:20:30]  It's the fake ticket?  Yeah.  The old fake ticket gag.  Yeah, that one's been around for a while.  But like you're saying, and I can't believe people are actually falling for this stuff.  People fall for it.  You got what, the top 10 scams of 2006 or something like that?  The top 10 scams.  Some of them I've never heard of.  Some of them involve like the stock market, things like that.  And they say, you know, if it sounds too good, that old gag, too good to be true.  You know what one that's getting people a lot, and you got to be careful of this too, is when you get a link from PayPal. 
[01:21:00]  Okay, my PayPal account or AOL.  Phishing, they call it.  That says, yeah, phishing, where it says, you know, click on this link because there's a problem in your account.  Always look up in the – I never do that.  Yeah, where your URL turns up because if it's not the official site of like PayPal, usually it will say like www, and then you'll see like a number 2 and a dot, and then it will say something else, and then it will say PayPal. 
[01:21:30]  So it's not a real site.  Do what I do.  I just X out of it, and then I just go to PayPal.com, and I log on regularly, and there's never been a problem in my account.  No, and they tell you.  They send you emails that they will never ask you for your name and password.  It's like it's just not done.  I was halfway through filling out one of those forms, and then I got to a mother's maiden name, and I was my – you know, started tingling a little bit, and then social security number.  I was like, okay, they don't need my entire social –  What the hell is this? 
[01:22:00]  Then I look up at the address bar, and it's just an IP address.  It's not even anything.  It was just numbers?  Yeah.  Oh, you almost got screwed.  But they're getting away with it.  People are doing it.  People are doing it because it looks – the email has like the graphic in it.  It's got the PayPal logo, and then you click on it.  It takes you to a whole different site that looks like PayPal, and you're there putting in your info, putting in your passwords, your name, everything they ask for.  You get too trusting.  That's one you got to be careful of because even if you're savvy with most things, that's not out of the realm of possibility. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  A company would contact you and go, look, we got to ask you some questions about your account.  You go right to the site.  Let's say hi to Sean in Rockland.  Sean, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Yo, my dad's a New York City retired firefighter.  Back in the day, I remember we used to get these huge boxes.  We'd put all our garbage in it, wrap it up in a nice-looking – like it was a gift.  Bring it down to the city.  We'd sit inside the firehouse and watch him steal it out of the back of his truck.  You would just do it as a goof?  I swear to you, dude.  It was one of the funniest things ever. 
[01:23:00]  They pull up in vans, cars.  We do it three or four times a week.  That is a video you could do for YouTube right there.  Where would you put all the stuff?  In the back of the fire truck?  No, he used to commute down to the city in a pickup truck.  Oh, pickup.  Like a pickup truck.  So in the back, it looks like it's some nice electronics, but they set it up ahead of time.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, I would set up a video and get that on YouTube.  That would be hilarious to watch.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Awful racial epithets inside.  And there's such a, believe me, I can think of some really bad things that you could put inside a box. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, God.  What's in the box?  Yeah.  Robert.  You're stealing it.  In Texas.  What's up?  Hey, morning, gentlemen.  Hey, buddy.  I work with a guy that has been scammed twice.  These online dating websites, you know, you put your information in and they match you up with somebody.  Yeah, match.com or something like that.  Sure.  I don't know which one. 
[01:24:00]  Whatever.  I'm just helping you along here.  You know, you got a contact from pictures and everything from supposedly a girl from Nigeria.  And they chit-chatted online for a week or so.  And then she wanted to come over here and get married and start a family and all that.  He sent, oh, I don't know.  He sent about three grand over.  Texas is slow.  She wrote back and she needs to go. 
[01:24:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah.  He definitely needed to be taped.  Ah, Pat in Deer Park.  Wake up.  Yeah, what's up, Pat?  Yeah, you're on, man.  What's going on?  Hey.  Um, when I went on my honeymoon, two old guys came up to me when my wife was away and  they took me for $1,000 in cards.  What do you mean?  What happened?  What happened is that I saw these people playing cards and then my wife walked away for a second. 
[01:25:00]  When they saw that I was all drunk and looped, they said, do you want to play some cards?  I said, sure.  So we went to the dining room area and they let me win the first hand and then they set  me up with a full house.  And I bet almost all my money.  I was banking, you know, banking the pot.  And then they, uh, some guy had a higher full house than me and I'd sign all my travel  checks away to these guys.  How much?  $1,000.  Uh, and it was all a fixed game, huh?  It was a big scam, yeah.  Well, it was just a quick game, though? 
[01:25:30]  Or it sounds like...  No, it was like the third hand and they took me.  My wife...  Third hand's pretty quick.  My wife's a ghost and she was a hysterical client.  And I still owe them more money.  Wow.  What'd you do?  Did you pay him?  Huh?  Yeah, I signed it off.  All right.  During your honeymoon, that's...  Nice.  Good job.  I'm sure your wife thought she made the right decision there.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So I told her, I said, what's better, a lousy honeymoon, a great wedding, a great marriage,  or a shitty marriage and a great honeymoon?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, bud.  You got more scams there, Ed? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, this one's pretty good.  It's called the Grandparents Scam.  This is a particular vile scam aimed at senior citizens who get a lot of scams, I think.  Perhaps the most vulnerable scam victims.  An elderly person is targeted by the scammer who calls and says something like, it's me,  grandpa.  The elderly person will respond thinking it's one of their grandchildren.  So you got to get one that's a little, you know, a little loopy, maybe prescription medication  or a little senile. 
[01:26:30]  You got to do some fishing with that.  I'm sure it takes a few.  Yeah.  The scammer then tells a tale of woe, saying they're in trouble and need some money, and  please don't tell mom.  The grandparents obligingly send a few thousand dollars, thinking they're helping a grandchild.  Investigators say it works more than you might think.  Well, how do you get it?  Where do you send the money to?  Is it a check?  It's probably wired through, you know, like one of those wire services.  Yeah, but if the grandpa's a little loopy, he's going to be able to figure out all that 
[01:27:00]  stuff, too.  I need to send money to my grandson that I don't ever have.  I've never had one, but he's called and he's in trouble.  Oh, he needs help.  These are the top scams of 2006.  Yeah.  It just seems like who would fall for this stuff?  And the phishing scams, which we just talked about, the emails.  There's also something called vishing with a V arrived on the scene.  Instead of asking the spam recipient to click on a link, they are instructed to call a toll-free 
[01:27:30]  customer service number, which seems more a way a financial institution might do business.  When they call, an automated system instructs the caller to enter account numbers and passwords,  which are then recorded by the scammer.  So it's the same thing as the website, only you're calling an 800 number and giving your  information.  Seems more official.  Yeah, that way it'll seem like, you know, because who hasn't just done that?  Put in your account number now.  Because I think most people are suspicious of the internet still, even though you're doing 
[01:28:00]  a lot of online shopping, but you're used to maybe calling a 1-800 number and giving  some of that personal info, right?  Yep.  I got a call.  I get these things in the mail once in a while.  I don't think it's a rip-off scam, more just to get you interested in real estate.  I think they're just trying to rope you in and sell you crap.  You have won.  And so I knew I didn't win.  So I called just to see what they were doing.  And they're giving me this nonsense on the phone.  And I said, look, I want you to stop contacting me.  And they go, well, sir.  I said, all right, let's make this clear. 
[01:28:30]  I'm on a national radio show.  If I get one more piece of mail from you, I'm going to give this number out on the air  and you will rue the day you ever sent me this.  Oh, yeah.  Buster, who's going to call?  They didn't say that.  Oh, no.  It stopped coming.  I guess he's not rueing the day, Mr. 1955.  They did not send me anything else.  Just like yesterday, I happen to have a problem with a certain computer company.  I will say it's not Apple.  Honestly, not Apple. 
[01:29:00]  And I had a problem with it, and I wasn't getting what I wanted.  So I said, I'm going to break this new computer on the air.  Wow.  I'm going to bring this in.  I'm so frustrated.  I said, I'm going to take a hammer, and I'm going to break it live on the air, and then  smash your company and be honest about it.  And they said, well, sir, let's get a supervisor.  And I immediately...  Oh, and then you talked to somebody that wasn't from India.  All I wanted...  No, they're never from India on this one.  Oh, really?  I just wanted what I wanted.  And you got it, right?  Yes.  But I didn't want anything that wasn't doing me. 
[01:29:30]  Just what is broken.  I am just looking for what is mine.  Speaking of computers, we'll be giving away a MacBook next.  Oh, wow.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[01:30:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  La la la.  La la la.  La la la.  Opie and Anthony show.  La la la.  Welcome back.  La.  That's how we're getting brought back from now on.  I like it.  I do like it.  I'm a professional.  We've got an update on John Liu.  We're going to do that in a minute here.  Oh, he's terrific. 
[01:30:30]  We're on that story pretty much.  But first, let's give away a MacBook.  We're doing MacBook karaoke.  Wouldn't it be funny if we just, or of course a coincidence, if we just entered stuff and one of our guys coincidentally won every week?  Every single week.  Or every day this week.  Until everyone has a MacBook.  Right.  That works for the Opie and Anthony Show.  It'll be highly illegal.  Is that against the law?  You can do something as illegal as giving away the MacBook.  Ow.  MacBook, Al.  What do you think, Al? 
[01:31:00]  Can we give away MacBook to people on staff?  Don't be a tattletale, Al, and tell Tom we're just joking.  Ow.  Al has to be the seer.  Ow.  Ow.  Down the hall there.  Speaking of Tom, I heard he was actually arrested in Nigeria for his tie.  He's getting braces.  He was telling me yesterday.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's got to be rough. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  On the outside?  On his legs.  He's going outside braces.  On his legs.  Jesus.  Like tiny Tim.  All right.  He wants to stretch and be a little taller.  We'll get into his braces on another day.  I'm sure he's running down the hall to get some air time.  Go back to your office, Tom.  We don't need you right now.  We're busy.  Go find Photoshop cleavage in the newspaper.  Oh, yeah.  What the hell?  Explain that really fast because now that's way too inside.  Yesterday he came in during a commercial break and prefaced the whole thing by saying, 
[01:32:00]  I don't do this all day.  But he opened up an advertisement.  But he made it perfectly clear that he does look for this on a regular basis.  Yeah.  It wasn't an advertiser.  It was a story, some woman fashion thing.  And a poem.  And showed her in different dresses.  And in one, she's kind of bent over and she's got a cleavage.  And in the rest, she's kind of flat-chested a little bit in some of these dresses.  And Tom goes, look, they Photoshopped the cleavage here.  Give a look. 
[01:32:30]  I'm like, yeah, I guess they did.  Oh, great.  Well, keep it up, Tom.  Whatever you do back there.  Good job.  I'm glad you're using your time wisely.  You missed it an hour later when I was talking to him.  But he brought me over to his computer and he showed me a photo of a nude tranny.  And he goes, look at this penis.  It's superimposed.  All disappointed.  Yeah, you could see.  It was like, wow, that was just good computer work.  All right, let's give away a MacBook.  We got three finalists today. 
[01:33:00]  Yesterday's finalists were just terrific.  Oh, yeah.  Which way will we go today?  Because it says the best in quotation marks on the website.  Best.  Well, the judge's decision is final.  And we're the judges on this.  Right.  May you and old Jimmy Norton.  Of course.  I'm judging things.  Who will be playing the Borgata New Year's Eve.  I forgot about that.  New Year's Eve at the Borgata.  And my friends Opie and Anthony will be there.  That's right.  Celebrating.  I'm not going.  I want you to go.  Nah, I'm not going there. 
[01:33:30]  I was going to get the girls a room and then me and you were going to be like a boys' night out.  Nah, nah.  Oh, mancation.  Absolutely.  Get a little tent in the room, we laugh.  All right.  Three finalists.  We got Dave Calabria doing more than words from Xtreme.  All right.  Now that I try to talk to you and make you understand, all you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hands. 
[01:34:00]  Let it play till the hard part.  Touch me, hold me close.  Don't ever let me go.  More than words is all I ever needed.  I needed you to show that you wouldn't have to say that you love me because I don't let it know. 
[01:34:30]  Boring.  Well, we do have an expert here, though.  Anthony knows vocals.  So, Ant, what do you think?  I think the guy did a good job.  Yeah.  Hit the harmonies and everything.  Yeah.  Very good.  He was good.  All right.  I thought he was good.  He's a good singer. 
[01:35:00]  Good singer.  Well, now we got Tina Law.  She's a finalist today.  Tina Law.  And she did Mr. Jones.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Cut up, Maria.  Show me some of them Spanish dances.  Is this the girl from yesterday?  No.  No.  No.  No, believe it or not. 
[01:35:30]  Believe in me.  Help me believe in anything.  Blow your nose.  And I want to be someone who believes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mr. Jones and me.  Jones!  Tell each other fairy tales.  Oh, no.  We stare at the beautiful women.  She's looking at you.  Oh, no, no, no.  She's looking at me.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  She's smiling in the bright light.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[01:36:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Is she out?  Mr. Jones and me.  Getting busted in Nigeria.  I just wanted a meal.  No, it was a misunderstanding.  I happened to have a blood sausage, and I was enjoying it and feeding it to my friend.  You can't even share a meal?  Not even share a meal with another homosexual in Nigeria.  What is all that?  You can be executed in southern Nigeria for that. 
[01:36:30]  It was just a mistake.  We were in Stewart's having a hot dog, and I took it and slapped his face with it, and we laughed.  God, all I wanted was some sushi.  I would have been executed if I did that in Nigeria.  Watch it.  Back in the day in N.E.W., who knew that I could have got executed for having sushi with the boss?  Oh, my God.  We were just having a California roll that hadn't been cut.  All right, are we saying goodbye to Tina?  Tina didn't make the cut, right?  I don't think so.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:37:00]  All right, because we got Joshua Marsik, or Marsik, I don't know, M-A-R-C-I-K, you pronounce it at home.  Joshua.  Hello.  Joshua.  Let's just call him Joshua.  Joshua did separate ways.  Oh, separate ways.  So Tina's out, so now we've got to decide if Joshua is better than Dave, okay?  I don't know.  Here's Joshua.  I don't know.  Someday, love will find you.  And break those chains that bind you. 
[01:37:30]  And one night will remind you.  Drunkus.  Wow, we got a tough choice today.  That kid's good.  That kid's good?  Yeah, he's good.  Wow, that is awful.  Playing off Jim Norton's and bit, yes.  The pauses were at the right time.  Drunkus.  For the new listeners, it's in the show opener, actually, Jimmy's little and bit. 
[01:38:00]  Get up early for once, and you'll hear that.  And Jimmy does it on the show as well.  All right, what do you want to do?  It's between Dave doing more than words pretty good, or Joshua just goofing around.  What's the actual rules of the college?  What was the request?  What was best, in quotations, that means we decide what was best.  That could mean it's something god-awful or something really good.  And what is it, two out of three?  Yeah.  That's what it goes.  I, in good conscience, I cannot vote for Dave. 
[01:38:30]  More than words?  No.  No.  What?  I would have to vote for Dave more than words.  Because he actually sounded good.  It's a faggy song, though.  It's a faggy song, but how many songs did he have to choose from?  Listen to the words?  And it's a very hard song to sing, because there's a lot of weird harmonies going on in  there, and he did a very good job.  You're getting soft, man. 
[01:39:00]  Soft?  What happened to you?  Am I supposed to vote for a frunker?  The guy didn't even do a second verse.  I might have given him a little more leeway if he would have done another verse.  I think he was on to something, but I think...  He was on something.  I hate to admit it.  I think I've got to agree with you, Ant.  He was on to something, but he didn't bring it home.  He came up short.  He didn't bring it home.  Look, I'm willing to vote for the goof factor.  If there's something just so god-awful or really funny, I'll vote for it.  But not just for the fact that he tried something and it fell on its face. 
[01:39:30]  The frunkers during separate ways?  Wait a minute.  Now, I have to speak up on this.  All right, Jimmy.  He had his own interpretation.  Interpretation?  Interpretation?  And I feel that he was a boy with gumption.  I like the Mrs. Jones woman better.  Really?  All right.  Than him.  The kid was stopping the mute.  You know what?  He was involved. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  We know that Dave did a pretty good job of more than words.  Let's...  All right.  So now we're knocking out Joshua in a separate ways.  He just missed with the goof factor?  Yeah.  I think he just missed.  I just want to hear Tina again.  Just a piece.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  She's awful.  Cut up, Maria.  Show me some of them Spanish dances.  She almost sounds retarded, too.  Mr. Jones.  Yeah.  Mr. Jones. 
[01:40:30]  She doesn't sound like she could even turn on a Mac.  Believe in me.  Help me believe in anything.  I love the yeah part coming up.  And I want to be someone who believes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's my favorite part.  Mr. Jones and me.  She's got a little list.  And she says, please.  Mr. Jones and me.  All right.  What is there?  Is there any info on these people?  She's cute.  Like, how old is she?  Yeah.  If she's like 45, it's really sad. 
[01:41:00]  It's okay if she's 15.  If she's 15, it's kind of cute.  Right.  No, I think she's over 18, but she's not very much over.  Not very much.  Is she a waterhead?  Not that I'm aware of.  Just a few droplets of water in there?  A few droplets.  She sounds a little off.  Just a little bit.  Not just singing.  Anthony, I'm going to give my vote to you.  What?  You decide.  It's between Dave doing more than words or Tina Law doing Mr. Jones really bad.  Remember, it's best in quotation, so you can go either way, Ann.  What do you say? 
[01:41:30]  All right.  I'll tell you something.  What do you say?  Tina did.  She was really trying.  And you've got to give her something for that.  Like I said, the more than words, that sounded very good,  but the guy sounds like he can do that, and he's done it before.  You know, it's a pretty good job.  He probably gets laid a lot because he can sing good. 
[01:42:00]  I say Tina gets it.  What?  What, what, what, what, what?  Sorry, dude.  Who saw that coming?  She sounded cute with her little lisp.  All right.  Get Tina on the phone.  Tina Law.  Yes.  Oh, man.  Is Dave pissed?  Dave's got to be pissed.  Well, Tina Law, congratulations.  You just won the new MacBook, sleek and sexy,  and has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities.  Head to the Apple store. 
[01:42:30]  A lot of creative possibilities.  Exactly.  Or Apple.com to check it out.  When it comes to creative possibilities, she's got all of them.  You can cover her creative possibilities with an Etch-A-Sketch.  Poor guy belts out a good tune.  He could probably use a good, a good Mac, has photo stuff he needs done.  You know what?  He was showing off.  We don't like show off.  Yeah, you're right.  This guy's good.  He's a good singer.  He's got something going for himself.  He'll do good in life.  He's a ringer.  He'll do well.  Let me give you a little advice, my friend.  Yeah.  See, she gets a MacBook.  You get some advice. 
[01:43:00]  Write some song parodies.  Send them into radio stations.  Get a cool job.  Wow, man.  Very good.  I like the twist there.  The twist there.  I vote under protest for Joshua.  Wow.  Screw stupid Joshua.  Joshua.  I vote under protest for Joshua.  Honestly, the guy didn't even have enough of the song to work with.  He was a good boy.  The cheapskate.  He had a great concept.  He just needed to just bring it on home.  A little more of it, and he probably would have walked away.  Less and more frunkus. 
[01:43:30]  A little more frunkus.  Another MacBook on the way tomorrow.  We're also doing a video contest.  It's more of an XM thing, but if you don't have XM, you can still check out the videos  that are coming in on openinganthety.com.  There's a really funny one we saw this morning, Bob Kelly puking.  Bob Kelly, our pal from Torgasm, the HBO show with Dane Cook, and he's been doing our show  for years.  It's very easy to make him puke, and we did this whole thing in studio where we had Pat  from Menaki, who's the star of the Baby Bird video, kind of open up a part of his 
[01:44:00]  body that you normally wouldn't open up to another man.  Right.  Especially if you're in Nigeria, because you would get executed.  So he does this, and Bob starts puking.  It's a terrific bit we did.  Well, the guy animated it into square people.  Little box people.  Box people, and there's something about it that is really, really funny.  Yeah, the way the camera pans around the room is done very well.  The little box figures, they're like stick figures, only made boxes. 
[01:44:30]  Square little boxes.  Yeah.  And they even kind of resemble us in some weird, archaic way.  If they go to opianthony.com, is it very easy to find?  I don't know.  Who knows?  I don't know, because they also have an Uncle Paul animated video.  Jimmy's character, he does.  And what's the other big one that is making the rounds?  There's another one that's pretty good.  I can't remember.  What's the other video?  Anybody?  Anybody?  Nobody.  Nobody.  Of course not.  Does it link to Foundry?  All right.  It must, first it must bounce off of the server that I have on the moon, and then it comes 
[01:45:00]  back to the space station.  I want to know on Foundry music, what is that big, it's like a metal sphere.  It's a cog.  It's a cog like a machine.  That's right.  Because it was a foundry, and it's made of steel in the foundry.  It's a cog.  Oh, I thought he just spelled.  That was our logo.  He didn't mean to write cog.  Cog.  Yeah, a few letters got mixed up.  Where's the videos for the video contest on opium? 
[01:45:30]  Your video's being served.  They're all linked up.  They're all linked up in the latest headlines.  Very easy to find.  It's very easy to find, so if you click on Headlines, Tuesday.  They're all linked up right there.  All right.  And what are the videos?  We got an animation of Uncle Paul, the bit that Jimmy does.  Uncle Paul.  There's the Bob Kelly one.  Square people.  It's hilarious.  There's one that just showed up today featuring Sam.  Sam.  Sam with his camera.  Which Iraq has right over there. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  And what was the other one?  There was another one that was really good.  Frankus.  No, not that one.  Dancing Jimmy.  Oh, that's right.  The Dancing Baby Jimmy.  Dancing Baby Jimmy, I like too, yes.  Okay.  Dancing Baby Jimmy.  So you can go over there.  All right.  Thanks, Steve.  Hey, before we take a break, we got to get an update on this stupid John Liu thing, man.  We're trying to get him on the phone to talk some sense into him.  But Rosie got in a lot of trouble on The View.  Please tell me she didn't grovel on the phone.  We also have Tina on the phone, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah, our winner.  Wow. 
[01:46:30]  Tina.  Yes.  Hi.  You entered the MacBook karaoke contest?  Yes, I did.  Where are you from?  I'm from Flushing, Queens.  How old are you?  I'm 25.  What grade are you in?  I'm a junior in college.  Now, you sing professionally.  See, I wasn't far off.  A junior in college at 25.  Well, you know, I've been through a lot. 
[01:47:00]  Been through a lot like what?  I have a baby boy.  He's two years old.  Where's Baby Daddy?  Oh, Baby Daddy's next to me.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe you didn't know.  Yeah.  All right.  And do you sing karaoke?  Only when I'm drunk.  Oh, so you were drunk?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a hell of a rendition, I must say.  Well, Tina, I got to inform you. 
[01:47:30]  You actually won today.  Oh, my God.  I'm so happy.  What are you going to do with...  My laptop's all broken, so I'm really grateful.  All right.  You got the MacBook.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You won because of your great singing.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Did you ever hear that song before you tried to sing with it?  Not really. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, because you were yelling the words out after they were actually said in the song.  I know.  I know.  I was off.  It would.  Yeah, you were a little soft.  Cut.  Perfect.  Print it.  One take.  A man of his size would have trouble walking through doors.  All right, Tina, we're not going to get much out of you, but you got the MacBook, all right?  Oh, that's wonderful.  Merry Christmas.  Thank you so much.  Congratulations.  Hold on a line.  There's Tina.  You have a gift.  She does sound a little off.  Yeah.  She won MacBook karaoke.  Hey, so John Liu, yes. 
[01:48:30]  Danny DeVito, drunk on The View.  Yep.  And Rosie went on The View and said that this news is all over the world.  All over the world.  And she said something like they're talking about it in China, and this is what she had  to say.  Pretty innocent.  It really is.  All right.  The fact is that it's news all over the world.  You know, you can imagine in China, it's like, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, Danny DeVito,  ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, Gronk, The View, ding dong.  Comes down to this, no one has a sense of humor anymore.  Not in the Asian community, it seems. 
[01:49:00]  No one cares that she did that.  No one really cares.  Stop it.  Well, John Liu does.  John Liu cares about everything.  He's a publicity-seeking hooah.  He's obsessed with his own Asian-ness.  Yep.  That's all the guy, I never hear him in the paper unless it's something involving Asians.  How about just helping people?  How about just people?  You're a, you're a, what is he?  Jackass?  Congressman.  No, is he?  Assembly person?  Is he a pedophile? 
[01:49:30]  Hall monitor?  No.  No.  A alcoholic?  Selectman?  Silly goose?  Councilman.  Councilman, no.  I don't know what he is.  No, he is a councilman.  What is he?  City councilman.  City councilman.  That is such a low rung on the political ladder.  Your vote barely counts.  He is doing his constituency a grave injustice by just concentrating on these things that people  don't really care about and doesn't matter.  Do something in your community that's going to really help. 
[01:50:00]  Not this symbolism garbage that you're passing off as helping your people when all it does  is get your name in the news to try to further your political career.  Hey, John, how about this?  Stay away from freedom of speech stuff and just get something done.  How about that?  Yeah.  Do your job that you were, what, elected or what?  You just got to step in and say you're a, whatever he is, hall monitor.  We gave him an idea yesterday.  Go after the illegal slave trade. 
[01:50:30]  There you go.  That's a biggie.  Your people are being brought over here and enslaved until they pay a debt off for being  brought over here illegally.  How about your work on that?  The poster of the Daily News did a whole thing on it recently.  Start opening up shipping containers.  Showing how they come over in shipping containers, like 20, 30 of them in one shipping container,  living among their own waste.  And a bunch of them don't even make it.  They open these containers and there's a lot of dead Chinese people in there.  And then the rest are in the slave trade right here in Manhattan. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you take that on, John?  Prostitution.  No, but don't take that on.  Take on Rosie O'Donnell for making a joke.  A quick goof joke.  The Chinese language kind of sounds like that to people that don't understand it.  Why won't anybody, especially a guy like him, he seems dumb.  If you can't tell the difference between somebody being just being humorous and being vicious,  if someone's being vicious, that's when you should step in.  Yeah, the guy's not qualified to hold any office because he can't distinguish when people 
[01:51:30]  are angry and being vindictive and hateful.  And when they are purely doing something out of humor.  Like, you lose all credibility when you're just that much of a self-righteous ass.  Like, why don't you complain about the fact that the City University of New York has a  little room named after this cop killer, Chesimar.  Why don't you worry about that?  Yeah.  There you go.  If you're going to nitpick, why don't you do something at least that means something?  And that's representative of all people.  That's offensive to, or should be, to all people. 
[01:52:00]  But no, he's very limited to only Asian causes, which is, you know, racist if you ask me.  He's trying to turn this into a Kramer thing.  There's nothing there, John.  Move on.  But he loves seeing his name.  Saw all the press.  He loves seeing his name in print.  He loves seeing his face on TV after he tapes these things.  To further his political career.  Does anybody else smash him?  No.  Anybody else smash this guy?  Everyone's scared crapless of this guy.  Terrible.  When he barks, everyone backs down, and I'm sick of it. 
[01:52:30]  Let's get him on the phone.  We're trying to get him on the phone.  John, stop hiding.  We want to talk to you on the show, either today or tomorrow.  Well, this is what John Liu had to say about the Rosie thing.  He's still on the Rosie thing.  Of course.  The latest audio.  Top show host Rosie O'Donnell has set off a firestorm of criticism.  This is what some call...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Firestorm?  The news is inaccurate.  The news is lying again.  This isn't a firestorm.  It's one guy.  It's one guy.  It's a bottle rocket. 
[01:53:00]  With a bad fuse.  Place on ground, light fuse, getaway.  Damn it, I had to lie to three times to get this thing going.  It's nothing.  It's a firecracker that John Liu should be throwing a bunch of in a scene in Boogie Night.  Picture him while a man in a robe dances to Jessie's Girl.  That's right.  It's an Asian joke.  What do you think of them apples?  What do you think of those pomegranates?  What?  That's what they eat. 
[01:53:30]  Chinese apple.  Is it?  They used to call them when I was a kid.  What?  And they also called those hazelnuts something too, but we won't get into that.  What do you used to call them?  Jimmy, talk for a second.  Um, um, uh, I think they used to call them, actually, they used to call them f*** toes.  What?  Oh my god, I got it.  Jesus.  The big, um, yeah.  All right.  There you go.  What the hell's wrong?  Hey, pass me one of those f*** toes.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  Here's, uh, here's, uh, John Liu over the Rosie thing.  Talk show host Rosie O'Donnell has set off a firestorm of criticism, this after what some  call racist remarks on The View.  Now a city councilman is asking for an apology.  World.  But you know, you can, you don't call Danny DeVito.  Comedian and co-host of The View, Rosie O'Donnell, made those comments while describing how Chinese  people were reacting to actor Danny DeVito's apparently drunken appearance on the Daytime  Talk show.  Almost immediately after the show aired, New York City Councilman John Liu's phone began 
[01:54:30]  to ring.  I, myself, like many others, we grew up with those kinds of taunts, and it brings back the  worst memories, and the problem is that it never ends at the taunts.  He's now writing a letter to Barbara Walters and co-executive producers and co-hosts.  Of The View.  Ugh. 
[01:55:00]  The taunts.  Can everyone get over the trouble they had in school?  Can everybody please just get over that?  Because everyone took crap in school.  Kids are vicious.  It's what happens when you're in school.  It's part of growing up and toughening up a little bit.  Yeah, everyone got teased because of the way they looked, the way they talked, the way they  dressed.  Everyone got teased in school.  Do you honestly think that the majority of the people that now are adults and go to 
[01:55:30]  work on a daily basis are still taunted like that?  Sure, it happens, but on such a level that you need an advocate to stop it?  Yes, it was a Brazil nut.  Thank you, Cindy.  I said hazelnut.  Yeah, well.  Brazil nut's a cold f***ing toast.  There you go.  But, I mean, we got to get over this whole thing.  When you're little children, kids are very cruel.  Get over it.  And how about Asians just be funny and tease back? 
[01:56:00]  How many people remember a class clown being Asian?  It's just not their nature.  You don't see a lot of really cut-up, hilarious Asian guys.  Don't you?  John Liu's making, like, Asian people look weak.  I'm a fan, won the last comic standing first year.  Funny guy.  Yeah, no, no.  I mean, he's obviously...  Sorry I said that.  Margaret Cho, terrific comedian.  Do you believe that, though?  When someone, like, starts talking for a whole group of people and makes that group of people  kind of look weak?  Look silly and weak.  They need someone to protect them. 
[01:56:30]  Like, they can't protect themselves.  You need a helper.  And they got all that, blah, blah, blah, stuff.  Right.  Now it's been doing it to women for years.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Make them look weak and needy and helpless.  Yeah, National Organization of Women has kept women down and in need of help for years.  That's the first thing I think when you get a John Liu spewing like this on the news.  You're like, man, you're making your people look like they're weak and they can't defend themselves  and they're inferior to everybody else.  It's not the joke itself.  It's what you're doing after the joke. 
[01:57:00]  No one cares about Rosie O'Donnell going Chang Chang Chang Chang.  Well, here's more, Lou.  People expect a very high standard from her.  No.  I certainly don't.  First of all, they don't.  Why?  Why?  Not the new Rosie.  Maybe the old Rosie.  They respect, you know, the new Rosie's all about being a little edgy.  I love how when your voice or your image is transmitted over the airwaves,  that all of a sudden there's this extra special thing you have to be. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, right?  Once they bust up your picture or your voice and beam it somewhere and then reassemble it,  you're all of a sudden this special person that has to uphold these standards.  How about this, John?  Maybe people should change their expectations.  Yeah.  Why should she change who she is because people have expectations, you dope?  Why?  Maybe people expect Asians to have a better sense of humor.  How about that?  And in the end, it's just a silly, silly show in the mornings for, you know, mostly, you know, housewives. 
[01:58:00]  It's not like it's Katie Couric on the, you know, the evening news or something.  Doing the Chang Chang jokes.  Ching Chang Chang.  And do you think Rosie O'Donnell's sitting there wondering how she can offend a group, an ethnic group?  No, she's making jokes.  She's just sitting there trying to make some people laugh.  A very high standard from her.  And I just wanted him to be aware that the Ching Chang bit that Ms. O'Donnell put out on Ms. Walter's show 
[01:58:30]  was offensive to Asian Americans and that we'd like it not to be repeated.  Speak for yourself.  The controversy was even debated on a national cable program last night.  This whole Ching Chang bit, it hurts us.  Okay.  I take it personally.  Meanwhile, Lou is awaiting a response from Rosie while making her this offer.  Ms. O'Donnell would like to learn Chinese.  I'd be happy to personally sponsor a class for her to learn a little bit of Chinese and understand what it sounds like.  That'd be great.  I think you just get on a curse of mouth. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  On the website, a bell says she didn't mean to offend anyone.  Oh, come on.  Rosie, you don't have to say anything.  You don't have to explain yourself.  You might have just said that sarcastically.  Look, I didn't mean to offend anyone.  She might not be apologetic with that.  She doesn't seem to apologize.  It wasn't an apology.  It was pretty much her saying, I don't mean to offend.  But that isn't even necessary.  It's obvious you didn't.  It's obvious to any thinking human being that you didn't mean to offend anybody.  And that was a nice version.  Look, to most of us, that answer yesterday, Chinese, that's how it sounds to us.  You order food? 
[01:59:30]  It's not pleasant.  We don't know.  It's a very strange-sounding language to people that don't understand it.  It's odd to me that anyone can understand it.  But they do.  And we don't need to understand it in America.  Maybe if all of a sudden we got a job in China, it's like, oh, man, I better understand this language.  What's up?  Video of the day?  Great car crash chase thing on Fox.  What happened?  Who called his office?  Which one of us, Dan?  Danny, we're trying to get him on.  What was the response?  His office is closed right now, but we're trying to get him on. 
[02:00:00]  Closed?  But maybe we could get him on tomorrow or later this morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The 2006 Eggnog Challenge will replay on Friday, December 22nd, the day after Opie and Anthony's appearance on The Tonight Show.  For a video of the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, including the infamous Pat Fumunaki Baby Bird video, go to opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREAT.  Craig in Queens.  What's up, Craig?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to sound off about this whole Rosie O'Donnell-John Lue thing.  Yeah.  I totally agree with what you guys are saying about people needing to lighten up and take a joke, but do you really think Rosie O'Donnell is the one to defend? 
[02:01:00]  Well, you're right.  You're kind of right, I guess, but...  Especially over this whole thing with Clay Aiken that just broke a couple weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  Well, she's a hypocrite.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  So I think it's...  Well, she was kind of pissed off at Kelly Ripa because Clay Aiken was on, and Clay Aiken then, what, tried to cover Kelly Ripa's mouth,  and Kelly Ripa was saying, hey, I don't know where that hand's been, and Rosie thought that was very insulting to the homosexuals.  Rosie assumed, here's what she assumed, is that she meant that his hand was somewhere awful, like maybe, you know, down someone's pants in some fashion, 
[02:01:30]  and then putting it on her face was, you know, not very, not very sterile.  It's kind of like the pot calling the kettle black, you know?  Wow, you make that up?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I'm going to jot that down. 
[02:02:00]  I went to school for seven years for that, gentlemen.  I'm going to work that into my rap tomorrow on the show.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Wait, wait.  Dude, what does the pot say?  It's like the pot calling the kettle black.  Black, okay.  Why is that bad if the pot just states the obvious?  Like if the kettle is black and the pot goes, you're black, and the kettle goes, and?  And now what?  Now what happens?  Any way you want it, Jimmy, I'll agree with you.  I believe the kettle advocacy group is very angry at this.  All right, Craig. 
[02:02:30]  And he goes, yeah, yeah, I guess they are.  Maybe the pot is white and the kettle is black, and the pot's parents don't like the association.  I don't think that makes a good point there, you know?  Rosie's kind of hypocritical.  Yeah, but.  He is.  Absolutely.  But John Liu's got to relax.  He's been on this whole making fun of Asian thing way too much.  He's just an ant.  Way freaking too much.  I really want to talk to him badly on this show.  I'd like to know in San Francisco if they're actually going to cut the part of the show  where we're critical of somebody Asian. 
[02:03:00]  Those dopes.  Who knows?  The terrified Asian people in San Francisco, because they might write letters.  Make up a lot of the population.  For what?  Nicole Richie was arrested.  Do we care?  Vicodin.  Vicodin and pot, though?  Vicodin and pot.  D-U-I, right?  Under the influence of drugs, not alcohol.  Right.  But no, not so much.  I don't really care about that when celebrities get D-Wees and stuff.  She started looking hot again, by the way, because she's gaining a little weight.  Does she get a little weight back?  Just a little bit, yeah.  Rumor has it she had her stomach stapled to lose the weight. 
[02:03:30]  Are you kidding me?  And you shouldn't do that unless you're really, you know, a big person.  Grossly obese.  So that's why she went into major anorexic mode, because you just can't get enough food in.  That was the rumor.  And then when she went into, recently she went into rehab or something.  I don't remember the exact story, but they were saying she was actually getting the procedure reversed.  Do you know anything about that there?  No, I just, I saw on the news that she went in for, just for the food thing, not drugs or anything.  Oh, that's right, yeah. 
[02:04:00]  But they said, no, she isn't going in because she has anorexia.  She's actually going in to get this procedure, you know, reversed, so she could start gaining a little weight back.  That was the big rumor in the stupid rag magazines.  Doing a little Vicodin.  And she's, her mugshot is what got my attention, because she's making like a sultry look, which seems to be the Hollywood thing to do.  Right.  Mel Gibson's last mugshot, people were talking about how he should use it as a headshot.  Yeah, there, she's kind of, she's got her head down a little bit. 
[02:04:30]  She's looking up through her hair a little bit.  That's the way to do a mugshot.  She kind of, you could tell she's wasted.  Oh, yeah.  You could absolutely tell when somebody's crime has been Dewey, because they kind of almost got a smile on their face, like,  da, you got me, da, you got me.  Let me just, I want to look sexy.  I want to, can we do another one?  Can we, one more.  Look at what I'm going to do, baby. 
[02:05:00]  Look what I'm going to do for you.  So she's kind of looking a little sultry.  Mel, all glassy-eyed.  We're looking at the mugshots right now.  Mugshots are great to check out.  Mel's a little glassy-eyed, but he's got that nice little spit-curl thing coming off the front.  His hair is brushed back very nicely.  He doesn't look a wreck.  He looks very Hollywood.  You know how depressing, him being arrested for drunk driving, you couldn't Photoshop me to look this good.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  And he's wasted and just went on some anti-Semitic tirade.  Yeah.  By the way, Nicole Richie was listed at 85 pounds when she got arrested.  85.  And it looks like she's gained weight recently.  What do you say?  Let's get Fatso on the phone.  Call her Fat.  All right.  Hey, uh...  Now, um...  What's her name here?  Is that Yasmeen?  Oh, yeah.  Yasmeen.  Which one is that?  Yasmeen Bleeth.  Yasmeen Bleeth?  Or something like that.  Wow.  From Baywatch?  That's a tough mugshot.  She, uh...  It looks like she's been punched in both eyes. 
[02:06:00]  And, uh...  Her lips look swollen.  Was this from a Dewey?  I believe so, yeah.  A domestic.  I believe it was a Dewey.  Yeah, Dewey?  Yeah, yeah.  Because she's a mess.  This must have been like they put her in the cell to, uh, dry out a little bit and then  brought her out.  You gotta take your mugshot, too, right away if you're a star.  Right away.  Because you're only gonna look worse when they put you in that cell and you sleep a little  and now you're hungover.  That's when you get the, um... 
[02:06:30]  That's when you get the, uh...  What was this?  Rip, uh...  Rip Torn.  Rip Torn's mugshot.  Is that Rip Torn?  Yeah.  That is Rip Torn.  Wow.  He, uh...  He got arrested for drinking and driving in 2004 and then, what, about a week or two  ago now?  Again?  That's just a terrific mugshot.  I think that's one of the best ever right there.  This is almost Nick Nolte.  Yeah.  Oh, actually...  Horrible.  Nick Nolte's still gotta be the best mugshot ever.  That's the greatest mugshot ever taken.  Yeah.  Um...  Combed his hair with a tsunami. 
[02:07:00]  Mess.  Uh, Robert Downey.  He, uh...  He's now gotten to the point he's been arrested so many times he just smiles for the camera.  Oh, yeah.  This looks like a shot with a fan.  He's doing like...  He's holding the little plate with his name and number on it and smiling like a fan  has his arm around him outside a club.  Can I take a picture, uh, Robert?  Yeah, sure.  Come here.  Come here.  And, uh, there's the Nick Nolte.  The famous Nick Nolte.  Hair just all over the place. 
[02:07:30]  What was he doing?  Was he drunk driving?  Yeah.  This one was, uh, a drunk.  Wow.  Uh, but apparently he was also doing a part in a movie here.  So his hair was all long.  But, uh, the greasy part I don't quite get.  I don't think he was filming as he was driving drunk.  No, no.  Maybe a little, little shampoo.  It just added to the nice look.  And then lastly, I'm looking at the Rush Limbaugh mug shot.  And this is, uh, a radio head shot.  Well, yeah.  I mean, he wasn't under the influence when they, uh... 
[02:08:00]  When they photographed him.  They caught him finally and they dragged him in and that's the shot they got.  For what?  The pills?  Prescription, uh, medication he had on him that wasn't, uh, in his name or...  The Viagra?  Oh, no, that's the one.  Remember that he had Buzz with Viagra too, I think.  Yeah, but it was like back pain medication.  Wow.  That he was addicted to.  He got away with murder.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hey, there's another great story that we got to get to before...  Before we get out of here.  Wow.  That lucky devil.  Well, this is unbelievable. 
[02:08:30]  You talk about making a statement.  Watch this.  Suicide attempt on live TV.  It's in Italy.  This is a father.  He's fighting for the rights to see his son after a 12-year separation.  Right now, he is dousing himself with gasoline and he wants to light himself on fire.  Well, they struggle with him to keep him from doing this.  It all happened on the current affairs show, 10 minutes.  The show's host and the man's 18-year-old son watched in horror as he poured that gas on himself  and then threatened to light the match. 
[02:09:00]  The crew finally wrestled the match away and took him off the stage.  Oh, just let him do it.  That's got to help with the custody hearing.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really going to further his cause.  Yeah, that'll put you right over the top.  I think he's incompetent.  He's going to set himself on fire.  All right, give him the kid.  Should let him do it, man.  Yeah.  That clip's up on YouTube and everywhere else, right?  Is it good?  I haven't seen it yet.  Yeah, he just kind of douses himself, but a little scuffle would have been better, you 
[02:09:30]  know.  Quite frankly, it's horrible, but it would have been for better viewing if he would have  actually lit himself up.  That's a hell of a way to go, man.  No.  Who wants to burn themselves up?  Man, you've got to be feeling some pain to want to do it that way.  It's like a protest thing to do.  Who does that?  Hindus?  I don't know.  I think they light themselves on fire in protest.  It's all a pain thing.  Make sure you're accurate or we'll get a letter from John Liu.  I don't think he really cares about the Hindus. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, well, make sure it's the Hindus and that's what I'm saying.  The Hindu version of John Liu, maybe.  Yeah, then we've got to deal with him.  John Hindu.  Our Bud Dwyer, though, is the best ever as far as suicide on TV.  Public?  Probably the only one, right?  I don't think there's ever been another one where someone killed themselves live on TV, right?  Not that I know of.  Not like that.  Wow, that guy was a close-up, too.  That was terrific.  They showed it all.  That was terrific.  Lunch baggie with a pistol in it.  Guy calls a press conference.  Do you know he actually had to leave the house? 
[02:10:30]  He had to get the baggie and he had to put the pistol in it and then roll it up like you would a sandwich?  Like it's lunch.  Yeah.  Is that video on YouTube or any of the other sites?  I'm sure.  That is just the most amazing.  He pulls it out of his lunch bag and he's like, ah, making sure no one rushes the podium.  I don't want to hurt anybody.  Stay away.  No, Bud.  They're all going, no, no.  No, Bud.  And then he gives that look around like, uh-oh, they're coming after me.  They're coming at me.  I'm going to have to do this.  I got to do it now or never.  And then, blam.  What a set.  He looks like Joseph Goriab from Champion Bank. 
[02:11:00]  Your bank says no.  Do this.  Blows his brains out.  And the twist to the story, he was going to be found innocent.  He was found innocent in the end.  Not in charge.  There was going to be nothing that would have happened to him.  Then that was just a bad prosecutor because there's no sign of guilt like blowing your  head off with a pistol you've packed like a lunch.  That's never a sign of I didn't do it.  That's true.  You'd be fighting for your innocence.  Yeah, I didn't do this.  Yeah.  All right.  It's his innocence like your brain's all over the podium. 
[02:11:30]  I rest my case.  Hillary, California.  What's up?  Hey.  What up?  I'm awake and I'm listening to you guys live for the first time.  Okay.  Oh, hi.  I've listened to you guys for like six years and I'm actually just purchased XM and I'm  hearing you live and I love it.  Oh, good.  And I just wanted to say hi and I love you and I love Jimmy.  I saw him last October at Cobb.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, you're San Francisco.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, actually Napa.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:12:00]  You rocked, baby.  Why are you up?  Awesome.  Why are you up, Hillary?  Mama couldn't sleep.  Well, you've been on the...  She's been on hold for two hours.  I don't have kids.  I don't have kids.  But no, I just couldn't sleep.  Then don't call yourself mama.  It's disgusting.  I love it.  I'm sorry, sir.  There is nothing worse than guys calling girls mama and girls calling guys like Poppy or Daddy.  I suck.  I have nothing.  All right.  Thank you, Hillary.  Thanks for calling.  All right. 
[02:12:30]  Well, you into that at all, Jim?  What's that, buddy?  Oh, mommy, daddy thing?  A little.  I mean, like...  No, no, no, no.  Don't get it.  Can I say that?  Yeah.  Like, do this for daddy?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Why?  Why?  Because it's filthy.  It is.  But it's filthy.  Why?  Because it's emotionally healthy.  Because it's dirty.  It's filthy in such a way.  Yeah.  Why do I spank?  I love to spank.  Why?  Why do I die?  Do you ever hold somebody's hair and just spank them?  That's a very parental thing to do. 
[02:13:00]  Hmm.  What a point.  I like a bare-bottom spanking.  I like an over-the-knee spanking.  Not even during anything else.  I'll put a girl over my knee, spank her through the jeans, slide them down, and then you discipline  through the underpants, and then perhaps a bare-bottom reddening, just to straighten  out.  Picture you in a black-and-white picture with your crew cut over someone's knee, getting  a good spanking like it's 1956.  The schoolmaster.  Yeah.  But I always say, like, really stupid things.  Like, I spank them for no reason. 
[02:13:30]  Like, it's never sexual.  I always spank them and go, why is there violence in Islam?  I'll just kill the sexual vibe.  And she turns around with a look like, I don't know.  I don't know why.  Stop hitting me.  I'm going home.  Well, you better give me an answer.  All right.  Well, I guess that's how we end today.  Yeah.  What the hell?  It's a good place to leave us.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  And don't forget about the homeless shopping spree.  Bye, you all.  All right.  We'll have more info on that tomorrow, okay? 
[02:14:00]  Bye, you all.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Take care.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming this Saturday, December 16th from 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[02:14:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show is going to bring a busload of homeless degenerates to a snooty  mall, maybe one in your town, and give them some money and take them shopping.  Golden buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless  shopping spree this Saturday, December 16th on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  It's Danny again.  Bill Burr finally called me, and apparently we were wrong. 
[02:15:00]  His Saturday night show is not called the Ass Licking Cock Rings and Pre-Comp Show, but  instead, Uninformed with Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa.  I guess we misheard him.  Our bad.  While the subject of cock rings and tushalingus might not be the focal point of Mr. Burr's  show, it's entirely possible that the subject may come up.  Some of us were hoping it would.  No cock rings?  Fuck!  So stay tuned for Uninformed with Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa this Saturday, December 16th  from 9 to midnight. 
[02:15:30]  Put an EQ on me.  I want to be bassy.  Make me sound like Don LaFontaine.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Outside 3FM in New York City.  Small crowd.  Put a nice crowd out here taking pictures.  I see an old face we haven't seen in a while.  Half a whole face.  I told you guys I ran into him at Union Square over the weekend.  Ran into him.  How are you all doing?  Still on a train.  How are you, bro?  Not dead yet. 
[02:16:00]  Not dead yet.  Yeah.  And I noticed you were smoking when you were working the other day.  You're like, what the hell, right?  You had nothing else better to do.  Why not?  And you're working for Tower Records?  Just until they close next week.  Right.  So what is it?  It's ear wiggles.  Does that give you a little extra dime?  What do they pay over there?  They don't pay me hardly nothing.  Really?  It's shit paying.  But it's a few dollars in my pocket.  That's good.  Get you a bite to eat. 
[02:16:30]  It's ear wiggles.  Do you notice that?  With a little wiggle.  I didn't notice that.  Yeah.  I've never seen him before.  Yeah.  No?  I've never met you before.  You've never met him at all.  I was away.  Holy shit.  You were taping Lucky Louie.  I was Lucky Louie.  Yeah, I was away.  Wow.  Yeah, that's Jimmy Norton.  Hi.  What's up, man?  How are you?  I'm all right.  You know Jimmy?  I've heard your stuff.  Yeah.  Last week, the eggnog challenge, the most disgusting thing I have ever heard on the radio. 
[02:17:00]  Wow.  I know.  That's coming from half old.  You know something?  You're right.  For me, it was too.  It took 30 seconds.  I went online and actually saw the mama for a ship.  It actually made me puke.  Really?  Yeah.  It was wild.  But it was good, though.  It was entertaining.  Well, is Leno going to take a walk over with us?  Yeah, we've said that too.  Yeah, yeah.  We used the Leno joke.  Well, you've been out of the loop as far as half a Hulk phase goes.  I have been. 
[02:17:30]  So the baby bird made you puke.  Half a Hulk.  Hey, is the tumors getting bigger?  A little.  They look like they might be a little bigger than what I remember.  I'm hopefully going for surgery sometime next year, but don't have the money.  It's starting to become noticeable.  How much does that cost you?  It stays paying for most of it, but I've got to find better living arrangements.  Better living arrangements?  Because I'm going to be bedridden for at least a good two, three months. 
[02:18:00]  Wow.  Having no money.  And you've got to stay off your face, right?  Yeah.  That's kind of a joke.  Oh, I wish I had my machine here.  I deserve something.  You don't sleep on the right side of your face, right?  Oh, you do?  It doesn't hurt or anything?  No.  You don't feel any pain?  Well, right now it hurts because, you know, the weather's cold, you know.  Right.  Since there's no feeling on the right side hardly, you know, it just hurt a bit.  Is it soft tissue?  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  What happens if you squeeze it?  Nothing.  Oh, oh my goodness.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  That's like rubber face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to be doing the whole shopping spree with us on Saturday, right?  Yep.  Yep.  Huh?  I can't hear you.  Touch it.  Touch it.  Can I touch it?  Go ahead.  That's pretty interesting.  Ant?  There, Jimmy, why don't you touch?  I don't know him that well.  Just touch.  Go ahead, man.  I don't give a shit.  Squeeze the tumor a little. 
[02:19:00]  I feel like he's a boy on Christmas, and I was just giving him a little...  You gave him a little touch.  It's really...  It's softer than I thought it would be.  I thought it would be like a hard mass in there.  It's like coagulating rice pudding.  That's a good...  Holy mother of God.  It's soft.  I've never heard that term before, but all right.  That works.  I got to know...  What if you have just put a pin in it and squeeze?  It hurts.  Did you hear it, Anthony?  It's hard to hear.  You just put a pin in there and squeeze it like a zit?  No, but I can show you guys something else.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, shit. 
[02:19:30]  What?  What?  All right, let's go.  Well, my ear canal is slightly bigger, so...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He put his whole pinky in his ear.  Oh, my God.  And now he's cleaning it.  All the way up to like...  All the way up to almost like...  The knuckle.  ...where it meets your head.  Holy shit.  Wait, what's that?  That's your ear canal?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  His ear is...  You could fuck that.  No, it's...  You pretty much can't.  Yeah.  He actually listens to XM without owning it. 
[02:20:00]  No.  I can't afford XM.  You should get something for that.  A good car crash?  No, that was good.  I did.  Hey, half a Hulk face.  I got an observation.  Your attitude's a lot different than the first time we met you.  You were angry at the world when we met you.  You seem a little...  A little happier.  I just don't give a shit anymore.  That's all.  That's good.  You know, there's freedom in that.  Absolutely.  You're just past that point where you say, fuck it.  Why don't we get him on the learning channel or something where they could do the surgery  like they do that before and after thing? 
[02:20:30]  They walk through it.  Wouldn't that be great?  Yeah.  Yeah, we should try to do something for half a Hulk face.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We won't tell him what we're going to do is we'll have another tumor put it on the other  side.  Yeah, now it looks...  Oh, oops.  All right.  Why don't we start the walk?  Come on, half a Hulk face.  That'd be great.  I haven't seen him in a while.  Got to use a hubcap as an earbud.  You got to describe it, Jimmy, because that's the first time you're seeing him live for the  new listeners out there.  Well, the right side of his face is like there's a fibrous mass in his face, and his ear is 
[02:21:00]  hanging down, like you said, almost to his neck, and the ear hole, it looks like a child's  pussy an inch away from his ear, and he looks like...  Half his face looks like a Leno, and the other half looks like not Leno.  It's just awful.  But how big is the tumor?  I mean, people got to understand.  This thing is...  Yeah.  Like a meatloaf.  It took over half his face.  Picture a meatloaf in half of your face.  Oh, and look who else is here.  It's Andrew. 
[02:21:30]  I think...  Hey, handsome.  Hey, handsome.  Hey, guys.  What are you doing?  Andrew, how are you?  Who's this looker?  Hey, fella.  How are you all today?  Good.  How are you?  I'm all right.  Very good.  You ready for Saturday?  I'm ready for Saturday.  Yeah.  We're going to try to get you some glasses and get you some clothes.  10 o'clock in the morning?  What time?  I don't know.  Yeah, we'll set it up.  10?  Good morning?  All right.  We'll find you.  Stay in this area.  You ever meet half a Hulk's face?  Pardon?  A fellow homeless guy.  He's not as homeless as you, but he's half a Hulk's face, we call him. 
[02:22:00]  Good job, man.  How are you doing?  I'm all right.  How are you?  I'm all right.  I earned all the money.  Gives us day-to-day strength, right?  Of course.  And we got to live with the Lord.  Always.  All the time.  Yeah.  The Lord is the most beautiful thing in the world.  Well, a house would be.  Exactly.  But the Lord would come in a close second.  Without the Lord, we cannot even survive.  What?  A lot of these people walking in the day who are here, you see, they cannot even realize 
[02:22:30]  how we live.  If there's two people that should really hate the Lord.  You know what?  They don't know any better, so if they knew, they would understand.  Yep.  You're a good man.  I do my best.  I think you brought me the right one today.  Well, he's going to be joining us, too, on Saturday.  All right.  Good.  God bless.  God bless.  So you two could shop together.  Yeah, we're going to have a nice crew on Saturday.  All I need is my glasses.  We'll try to get you those glasses you need. 
[02:23:00]  Keep this one of your hats.  I don't need no money.  I just need glasses.  Just need glasses.  Cool.  Then you'd realize who you're talking to and not be so friendly.  I'd be so happy.  God bless you.  God bless.  God bless there, Andrew.  We'll see a homeless shopping spree.  On Saturday.  On Saturday.  Could be the best one ever.  Could be the best one ever.  Have a Hulk face.  That's something that shakes up the people, though, a little bit as they walk down the sidewalk.  Oh, absolutely. 
[02:23:30]  Have a Hulk face.  They're all staring.  Yeah, have a Hulk face.  Why is he behind us?  They're all staring.  Yeah.  Tell them to walk in front of us.  Yeah, lead the parade, half Hulk face.  Lead the parade, sweetie.  His tumor is getting bigger, and his face is now, his mouth is now sideways.  Yeah, it's on the side of his face.  Yeah, it's really starting to droop.  Come on, handsome fella coming through.  Operation.  Yes.  What kind of operation?  How do they take that out? 
[02:24:00]  Hopefully one of the Kevorkian oversees.  If I was him, I'd walk on the right side of the sidewalk.  So would I.  All the time, right?  All the time.  Yeah.  I wouldn't attempt the left side of the sidewalk.  I would always wear things on the left side of my body that drew attention.  Like my left leg would always have cymbals on it.  Sha-cha-cha.  Sha-cha-cha.  Sha-cha-cha.  I'd have a tambourine, a fucking lime green tambourine in my left hand.  I'd hold it away from my body.  Ar-ra-ka-ta-ka.  Ar-ra-ka-ta-ka. 
[02:24:30]  All right, let's go this way.  It's a lot colder today than it was yesterday.  I'm not enjoying the walk today.  I didn't put my gloves on.  I thought it was supposed to be warm today.  It's very hard for me to look at and have a Hulk face and complain about anything.  Exactly.  That big droopy ear.  Oh, I know.  Keeps his ear to the ground.  Ow.  Jesus.  Oh.  What?  He's got like a duty or something.  You know what?  How much tobacco can he chew?  Oh, my God.  Is that crap in his pants? 
[02:25:00]  I don't know.  I think it's just his pants are dyed a little bit.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  He's just going.  He has no idea.  He stopped.  Yeah, he has no idea.  We're turning.  He keeps walking straight.  He doesn't know any better.  He doesn't know.  If he knew any better, he'd have that thing taken off.  Last year, he was very angry.  This year, he doesn't seem as angry.  No.  Oh, my goodness.  His head's a mess.  Yeah, that is a fucked up head.  Holy cow, his big dumb ear. 
[02:25:30]  One of the greatest finds ever.  Oh, he's just awful.  Where is he?  He's on the other side of the street, just walking away.  He's going in a strong rock.  Holy shit.  You ever see a fucking head droop like that?  It looks like half his head is on Earth and half it's on Jupiter.  But it does look like half of it's turning into Hulk, right?  Yeah.  It's like some kind of superhero.  Who named him that?  That sounds like a pretty strange term.  Who was that?  Was it Patrice?  Yeah, I figures. 
[02:26:00]  Half a Hulk.  Half a Hulk face.  You look like a half a Hulk face.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, if it continues like that, people are going to start to stare.  You know, you do want to get that taken care of early.  Now he's walking, now he's across the street walking back the other way, trying to find us.  Is he trying to find us?  Can someone get him?  He should be the spokesperson for this show.  I can gather him up.  What a mess.  You dropped something, miss. 
[02:26:30]  Perfect.  She looked right down at it.  Okay.  Speaking of...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Someone took the Hulk's tumor out.  Yeah.  And it's a big, massive tumor that someone dropped their tie on.  Why?  Sitting behind the desk.  Yeah.  Why is there a tumor with a tie on it?  Just lurking.  Hi, sir.  Happy holidays, as they say. 
[02:27:00]  See the Christmas tree in a menorah and her wreath in a very politically correct building.  We'll see you upstairs.  Opium with the XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:27:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Opie.  I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[02:28:00]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, why is the window open?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Did we find half a Hulk face?  Or is he gone?  I'm still wandering the street. 
[02:28:30]  We should get some new pictures of him and throw them up on opianthony.com for the new  listeners.  Because he hasn't been around in about a year.  And I just happened to run into him over the weekend in Union Square trying to make a buck  or two for Tower Records.  You know what he should do?  Huh?  You know what I should do?  Huh?  Plug in your headphones?  Um.  He should.  He should.  He.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Um.  He.  He.  He.  Hello?  What's up, buddy? 
[02:29:00]  What's wrong?  I don't know.  What is that?  How can you hear, Anthony?  With no headphones.  Somebody plug him in.  What is that?  Did it break in there?  Did it break off in there or something?  Probably.  I don't know.  Half a Hulk face should go down to where the Phantom of the Opera plays and put a Phantom  of the Opera mask on and take pictures with people for money.  We can make him a lot of money.  Yeah.  How can he do that?  He could slap his face for a buck.  Hey, man.  Is he still around? 
[02:29:30]  Let's go grab him.  We should have people just line up outside.  Yeah.  We should start our own little freak show.  Uh-huh.  Starting with half a Hulk face.  Hold on.  You come up and take a picture with half a Hulk face.  People would want a picture with this guy.  I'm telling you.  Picture with half a Hulk face.  How much?  $300.  Got to keep it like...  We just need one taker.  A couple bucks.  $10?  That's pretty expensive.  $5.  This guy is poor, though, man.  $5?  $5 for a picture with him, and you get to do this. 
[02:30:00]  To the tumor.  You get to squeeze.  Dude, everyone...  Oh, yeah.  You get to scratch it like it's an animal.  You get to go...  Right under his little big chin.  Why not?  Not by the hair on my chinny chin, bro.  I don't know why I saw that really funny.  Thank you.  Kenny, yes, I will have a smoothie.  Me too. 
[02:30:30]  Under these conditions.  Right.  Yesterday, too much strawberry in that motherfucking thing.  Yes.  It was red.  Yep.  And it tasted like strawberry with a little banana taste to it.  I like more banana than strawberry.  You want it more banana-y.  Right.  Banana-y.  So the color of it is more of a banana color with a pink tinge.  You want it to look like his tumor drained into a cup.  Exactly.  As a matter of fact...  But cold.  Can I have a tumor drained in a cup smoothie?  That's right.  With a little protein powder in there, Ken. 
[02:31:00]  Can I have some disinfectant?  Why?  For clutching?  Squeezing the tumor really freaks me out.  I don't know how you do that shit.  Not much freaks me out, but that kind of got me a little like, ooh.  I like the same thing, Ken.  Because I didn't expect it to be kind of like mushy like it was.  I thought it would be kind of like a solid mass in there.  Oh, you'd be licking your fingers if it was solid?  There's something about it being mushy that really bothered me.  Did you notice when you squeezed it, his little foot kicked out a little?  You squeezed it, and his left foot went, meh. 
[02:31:30]  Squeezed, meh.  I noticed his ear went up a little bit more.  I can't believe you've never met him.  I've never met him at the Hulk face.  God, man.  You miss some stuff when you're being a Hollywood star.  He stuck his pointer finger all the way into his ear canal up to the knuckle.  And it wasn't even like he had to force it in.  It just went right in.  Right in.  Everything is just pulling down like, yeah, there's too much gravity.  Someone is saying we should do Chubby Bunny with Half-Hulk Face.  Where is this guy? 
[02:32:00]  Is he gone?  He was walking down the street.  We lost him.  I told the guys to go find him and bring him back.  Put on an ATV.  There's so much we could do with him today.  It's going to be hard to find him.  Everyone's looking for that special MySpace picture.  We got it.  Oh, yeah.  Show up at XM.  You know, pay your $5 to $10, and you get a picture with Half-Hulk Face.  You throw it right on your MySpace page.  And he's fun to Photoshop, because you can make whole Hulk Face or no Hulk Face.  We got him?  We got him, yeah.  All right.  You just split his head in half on Photoshop and then put the two good pieces together and 
[02:32:30]  put the two Hulk pieces together.  Right, right.  Want some meat?  No, I'm going to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for everybody today.  I won't be having any.  Yes, I am.  I hate peanut butter.  Yes, I am.  I despise peanut butter.  What else do you hate?  Mom and apple pie?  What else do you hate?  Peanut butter is disgusting.  I like peanuts.  I don't like peanut butter.  Peanut butter is my favorite food.  I can eat that every single day.  You know what's good?  It gives me the worst farts, so I got to kind of... 
[02:33:00]  You know what's good?  I'm going to tell you this is good.  My ex-girlfriend got me to buy it.  It's $12 a little bottle.  Almond butter.  Ugh.  Almonds.  Almond butter is really good.  Is it?  It's totally natural.  There's nothing in it but crushed almonds.  Nothing in it but almonds.  Isn't that just like peanut butter?  No!  Peanut butter has all kinds of things the Jews put in it.  Hey, we're on to something.  Someone has to bring back the freak show.  Every once in a while, someone kind of tries, but they don't really succeed. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Look at this.  Brad in Jersey.  Go ahead, Brad.  What's up, guys?  If I can come by Friday morning, a buddy and I just plan to come by for the walkover,  I'll be with half a Hulk face and pay $20 for a photo with the guy.  $20?  $20 for a photo with half a Hulk face.  Now we're on to something.  If it helps the guy out, why not?  All right.  Keep listening to the radio.  We're going to try to set it up.  We're trying to get him upstairs and then we'll talk to him, see if this is...  Of course it's feasible.  This guy needs money.  Yeah, what else is he doing?  All right.  We should put him in a silly outfit, too.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Something silly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something freak show-ish.  An elf.  Like an...  Yes.  Something Christmassy.  God damn it, Stan.  Good point.  Maybe some type of a little elf hat.  With curly shoes.  Curly shoes and a green felt outfit.  Yes.  A little green felt vest.  And he shouldn't be allowed to talk.  Whenever you talk to him, he should be forced to go,  I'm too little-y, too little-y, too little-y, too little-y, too little-y, too little-y, too little-y, too little-y, too little-y.  His face looks like a melted candle. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  It's just, you know, when you get a candle and it's not placed just right, so the right side is all collapsed.  Oh, my God.  He's like three Vincent Price movies.  Jesus.  It's gotten worse, too, man.  It's gotten worse if you haven't seen him lately, because his pictures are all over the Internet and all.  But he'll be part of, you know, the homeless shopping spree on Saturday.  Can't wait.  Can't wait is right.  Let's say hi to Eric in Iowa.  Eric.  Yeah.  Hey, you guys were talking about people shooting themselves. 
[02:35:00]  There's a clip.  I don't know if it's on YouTube or not, but I seen it on TV a few years ago.  This lady's being interviewed by a news reporter, and her ex-husband comes up behind her and just starts shooting her.  And the fucking news reporter and the cameraman just take off running.  Of course.  Wouldn't you?  Oh, I think I did see that.  Didn't she live or did she die?  No, she's dead.  I don't remember.  I think she lived, because I don't think the show I've seen it on would show a snuff flick, but it's a trip, man.  The dude just comes up from, like, out of the picture and just starts unloading on her. 
[02:35:30]  And the news lady and the cameraman take off running.  Now, that was the whole gist of the clip, is because she didn't live.  No, she's dead.  See?  Yeah.  Victim of the morning age.  Poor, poor girl.  Yes.  She got shot.  One of my favorites of all time of watching somebody get killed on television is the guy that they're bringing through the courthouse hallways. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I forgot about that.  And he had molested this man's son.  He was a karate instructor.  Yep.  And they're bringing him through, cops on either side of him, and there's a guy at a payphone.  And he's just kind of, you know, standing in the little payphone cubicle thing on the side of the hallway.  And when they bring this guy past, he spins around.  The guy at the phone spins around, points a pistol at the guy's head, boom, pulls the trigger, blows his head right off.  The guy goes down.  The guy drops the gun, puts his hands up. 
[02:36:30]  The cops grab him.  Yep.  And then they tend to the guy on the ground for like a second.  And they just know.  They look and go, oh, fuck.  And then they're all looking like, oh, my God, am I screwed?  I was supposed to be watching this fucking guy.  You can see it in their face.  But the guy just wanted to kill the guy that molested his son.  Dropped the gun.  Didn't put up any fight after that.  He had kidnapped the guy's son, too, I think.  He deserved to absolutely be executed like that.  Oh, yeah.  And the guy was acquitted on justifiable homicide.  Yep.  He was acquitted, as he should have been.  My favorite.  I mean, you could kill a cop doing that, so you really shouldn't do it. 
[02:37:00]  Just so you don't accidentally shoot like a marshal.  Yeah, I know.  The guy, that must have been planned.  You know what that guy must have been feeling right at that moment?  Oh.  Every pedophile should get that.  Yeah.  Just a shot to the head.  After your trial, if you're guilty beyond a shot to the head, and you're done.  I'm glad it worked out that way, too.  He killed him instantly.  Didn't hit any of the cops.  And just dropped the gun and put his hands up.  Said, okay, my job's done.  Now I'll let the fucking justice system take over.  It's great. 
[02:37:30]  My favorite one, but the guy didn't end up dying, but that stupid lawyer trying to hide  behind the tree, and the guy's just...  Oh, the guy's shooting.  That was like a Keystone cop.  But the dumb lawyer is poking his head out.  Kept poking his head out from behind the tree.  Giving him a target.  This gruntled client chasing his lawyer around a tree, shooting him.  And the lawyer's trying to hide behind the tree.  But he's kind of poking out to see where the guy is.  And it was the same tree.  Right.  Like, it was like a comedy.  What did the guy do?  Did he approach the lawyer, or did he hide somewhere else? 
[02:38:00]  He was hiding somewhere else, and he pulled out a gun and shot him.  And the lawyer ducked behind a tree, and the guy chased him up to the tree, was on the  other side of the tree, like doing a ring around the rosie trying to get him.  As part of that video, he unloaded his gun, and then just kind of puts the gun away and  walks away.  Yeah, walked away.  Kind of peacefully, just kind of walks away.  Did he hit him with the gun at all?  Did he shoot him?  Yeah, he did.  Oh, yeah.  The guy's survived, and pretty much is fine.  But he got shot a few times.  He hit him a couple of times, like in the hand. 
[02:38:30]  Someone should put that video to Benny Hill music.  Oh, would that look funny?  And fast motion, because fast motion makes everything funny.  If someone does it, you know, bring it to our attention, I don't know.  Are you really making peanut butter and jelly today?  Mm-hmm.  You're not kidding, raspberry jelly.  I like raspberry jelly.  I bet you do.  Ah!  Oh.  Here it is.  Hello.  Here it is, Jimmy, look.  Oh, there it is.  That little ass tree.  Oh, there's a tree.  Look, look, there's a tree, and the guy comes out.  No, he's done shooting already. 
[02:39:00]  Go back.  Yeah.  The shooting part's really fascinating.  It's on YouTube.  It's under Man Shoots at His Lawyer.  What a little tree.  Watch, watch.  There it is.  Look at him hiding behind that little tree, and he's shooting every time.  He's shooting a tree, this asshole.  Look at this standoff.  Look how he just casually walks away.  And he's like, ah, all right, you'll get my bill.  You know he's saying, oh, go fuck yourself.  And the guy is walking going, hey, excuse me, I'm shot here.  And no one cares.  That's the beauty of the whole thing.  He's like, uh, excuse me, I was shot.  Does anyone notice this? 
[02:39:30]  Look at this fat, homicidal maniac.  But he wasn't really trying to kill the lawyer.  He would have, there's no way he could.  He was trying, he was shooting around like he kept missing.  And there's this little, it was, it was, the tree had to be eight inches in diameter.  Is the, I, I've seen cocks, like this guy could have hid behind better.  Oh, there they go.  And then the cops take the guy down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The whole thing was videotaped because the cameramen were outside the court because it  was a pretty big case at the time.  And now they wrestle him.  Oh, is that great?  That's unbelievable.  Hey, uh, half a Hulk face. 
[02:40:00]  Come in here for a second.  Half a Hulk face.  There's half a Hulk face.  You only get half the music.  That's all we give you.  How much money does Tower Records give you?  Um, I make, uh, like.  I make 60 a day.  Really?  60 a day. 
[02:40:30]  You got headphones on.  You might want to pull the right side down a little more so you can hear.  There you go.  Can you hear out of that ear?  Um.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little muffled probably, right?  Yeah.  After they do surgery now, they'll have to tighten the skin a little bit because the skin  is, is, is plant.  Will they, uh, whose water is this?  Was that mine?  I don't know.  It's mine?  Okay.  This here's?  No.  Okay.  Um, the, uh, no, I didn't know if it was the water.  Now, will you be able to hear it for full, like, and get feeling back?  Um, their plan is this surgery. 
[02:41:00]  They want to go, the doctors are saying that they can actually go in and remove the whole  tumor.  Oh.  But, when they do that, they're going to have to break my jawbone to reset it because  growing up, you know, the tumor caused my, the right side of my face to become disfigured.  How long have you had that?  All my life.  And no one ever said, let's fix this?  I've had, since I was a kid, I've had about 12 surgeries.  Jeez, what would it look like now if you didn't? 
[02:41:30]  I would have been dead.  Really?  It just keeps growing back?  Um, yeah, because it's, it, the tumor itself is, it's on my nerves.  So.  Yeah, it would get on my nerves, too.  Oh, you mean literally.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sorry.  I thought you were figuratively speaking.  Growing up, the doctors told my parents that I would not live to see the age of 16.  If I, you know, if I didn't.  That's horrific.  You know.  That's horrific.  If I didn't have any of the surgeries I did.  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  They were saying that one reason why they didn't want to go in as a kid and remove the whole tumor,  they were afraid that they would have pinched some of my facial nerves, which would have caused me to be paralyzed on the right side of the body.  As I got older, doctors were like, those nerves have been dislodged, dislocated for years.  So, they could have done it then.  Ah.  Last, well, the two last surgeries, last one they did, what, two years ago, to prepare, to prepare me for this one is they removed all my teeth. 
[02:42:30]  They removed all your teeth.  You have no teeth?  Can you open your mouth?  Oh, what a hummer.  Wow.  And the surgery before that, they tried to do something, but my blood pressure dropped on the table.  I died for about 20 seconds.  Jesus.  Oof.  So.  St. Peter said, holy shit.  Send him back. 
[02:43:00]  Wow.  No teeth.  Nope.  What do you eat?  Just a lot of applesauce and softer foods?  No, I eat.  It's a pain in the ass, but, you know.  How do you chew them?  I'll bet.  It all comes out whole.  Yeah.  That's funny.  These chips and stuff, are they going to put new teeth back in for you?  That's the plan.  Cool.  Yeah, but now, when are you going for the surgery?  It all depends when I find better living arrangements, because I'm renting a room at a hotel now, and roaches, mice, you know. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, they'd be picking at things.  Yeah.  Uh, roaches and mice.  So, so, like, how are you going to get better living conditions if, you know, you only make  it 60 bucks a week over there?  A week?  60 a week?  A day.  Oh, 60 a day.  Oh, okay.  But, you know, eating, you know, I pay, like, $120 a week for the room, so the money I make 
[02:44:00]  on a weekend, it all goes toward that.  Wait, 120 a week, is it a good room?  No.  It's the size of a cubicle.  Do you share a toilet with people?  Toilet and shower.  Now, are there roaches?  Well...  Yep.  How many?  I mean, there's a lot?  Yeah.  Infested.  Do you see them?  Yeah.  Are they crawling on you when you sleep?  Yeah.  They crawl on you while you sleep?  Well, I can't, well, I don't give a shit, so...  Well, you got bites?  Yeah.  Are those roach bites or no? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Cockroaches bite?  Holy God.  Yep.  They bite.  Cockroaches bite.  There was one, my girlfriend and I were at a restaurant last night, and we saw one,  she was sitting there, and all of a sudden, right behind her...  No, no, here's why.  Right behind her, a roach starts crawling up the wall, and I go, uh, don't move back.  And she goes, why?  And she goes, uh.  So we called the waitress over, and we just moved to a middle table away from the wall.  Because it's a restaurant I eat at all the time, every restaurant has them.  You can't... 
[02:45:00]  It's in New York City.  Oh, I'm never eating a kid.  Again.  Every one has a roach.  I mean, Morton's, I don't care who you are, you're occasionally gonna get a roach.  So, you see one, you can't freak out.  Filthy.  Nah, the roaches are bad, but...  I hate roaches.  What kind of bites they gave me to you?  Oh, my God.  Um, just little bites, you know.  I love bites.  Yeah.  Love bites.  Hello.  Is that the only tumor you have, by the way?  Um, I have small little bumps, like these. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Uh...  You got two belly buttons, too, I noticed.  What's that scar from appendix?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I painted, uh, appendix burst at 2,000, nearly died from that.  Mine burst when I was seven.  Wow.  My Dr. Halavopoulos had to go in there and fish him out behind my little intestines.  Mm.  They burst.  Mm.  All right, so...  Let me see your tumors again on your stomach.  You had, like, a bunch of...  What exactly is that, uh...  What's that called?  That's a tumor?  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  That's a tumor.  Aw.  Those are tumors.  They're cute.  The medical term...  It's freaked out.  What's it called?  The medical term for it is, uh...  Yikes.  ...neurofibromatosis.  Is that what the elephant man had, but he had it much worse?  No.  Oh.  What'd he have?  Smartass.  Um...  No, I'm not even kidding.  Um, he had, uh, calcium buildup on his bones.  On his head?  Jesus.  Yeah.  How much milk did he drink?  Hey, elephant dude, slow down with the homogenized.  Have a soda.  It was one of those...  Might be lactose intolerant. 
[02:46:30]  It was one of those rare cases, so...  I mean, come on.  That's all right.  It's one of those rare...  Yeah, he was...  He really...  His head was all big and shit.  I was like, whatever with this dude.  People are gonna look at him.  Hey, have Hulk face.  Have you ever...  Big hat?  Have you met other people like yourself?  Um, once.  Yeah.  You know, I go to the, um, the national website, which is nf.org.  Nf?  Nf.  That's short for...  Never fucks?  Can we get that?  Well, neurofibromatosis.  But you just go nf.com? 
[02:47:00]  nf.org.  Dot org.  Dot org.  Dot org.  And we get to see people like yourself?  Um, no.  It tells about it.  Basically...  Oh, screw that.  We need photos.  There's two types of NF.  There's NF1, which is what I have, which is hereditary.  And the sites show that one out of every 4,000 people have what I have.  Wow.  One out of four grand?  Yep.  That seems kind of common.  I mean, you would think you would see more in New York City, then. 
[02:47:30]  Well, I haven't seen...  A lot of people here, you know.  I haven't seen no one in New York City with that.  Hey, uh...  What's the other one?  What's number two?  Yeah.  Um, NF2, that's the more rare type.  One out of every 8,000 people have that.  What is that?  Um, that's just a mutation, you know, in a gene.  Now, you have you...  How old are you?  32.  Okay, and you've had this your whole life?  Yeah.  Have you ever been laid?  Yeah.  Okay, how do you get laid?  Do you go to hookers or do you just girls bang you?  Girls bang me.  I've had girlfriends, been engaged, you know. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  Was this in between surgery, like when the surgeries had just happened?  Yeah, I was engaged a few years ago until the bitch cheated on me, so...  Ah...  What did she look like?  Oh, she was...  She was good looking.  It was when I was living up there in Canada for a few years.  Now, were the tumors gone then?  No.  Yeah.  Just like that?  Yeah.  I had to meet, you know, even then.  You must have a hell of a personality.  You know, a big cock.  Or a big cock.  Big cock.  He's all cock.  This kid's all cock.  He probably has a cock with bumps on it, you know?  Nope, don't have that.  That's good.  The Elthaman didn't either. 
[02:48:30]  God is not that fucked up.  The Elthaman's dick and his left arm were terrific.  He had a fuck...  Actually, he had an exemplary left arm.  And his dick was a thing of beauty.  And he had good thighs.  John Merrick had thighs to die for.  I mean, I'll say that for that kid.  I don't know so much about that.  I've seen nude pictures of him.  How do you not look?  Hello.  What?  Seen nudes of him?  He went to the ballet.  They were all nice to him because the fucking queen liked him.  But deep down, they were all like,  All right, sit down, stupid.  No one's...  I like when John Merrick gets the little fucking shaving kit 
[02:49:00]  and he dabs a little cologne daintily on his finger  and then throws it back on his big neck.  Holy mother of God.  What is that picture?  What is that?  Looks like the skin is boiling.  That's nervous.  That's definitely noticeable.  You ever look at guys like that and go,  Fuck, at least I'm not that bad.  Oh, that's Frank.  Well, that is a bad cane.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  You know how hard it's got to be to fucking shave your chest? 
[02:49:30]  Get your asshole eaten by a girl?  It's impossible.  The guy, he looks like...  Exactly.  It looks like boiling skin.  Like there's little boil marks all over his skin.  Everywhere.  Looks like his skin is bursting.  Like a lizard band.  Hey, what's that?  Oh, this is a guy who's got even worse tumors than...  It's called Saving Face.  From Shock Magazine.  Masked by his own flesh.  He has a...  This guy's a mess.  He's Asian, so his eyes are even fucked up naturally. 
[02:50:00]  And he has a tumor.  He looks like a fucking giant Sharpay.  Let me see.  A homosexual should be walking this guy.  Oh, my God.  That guy's alive?  Yeah.  He can't even see where his features are.  He's actually a hand model.  Well, have a Hulk face.  We want to get you some money.  Would you do photo ops?  Of course.  Like if we invite the listeners.  Where do you want to do this, Anthony?  Here?  Over there?  On the street?  On the street could be good, because then we could get other people. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  We could maybe get like a bullhorn or something and try to call people.  We need somebody else down there with him.  Yeah.  With like a sign.  Maybe a bullhorn.  You want to try today?  Poor guy.  That'd be good.  All right.  Give him some bucks.  Danny!  Danny would be good at this, right?  But then how are they going to get the picture?  Get a Polaroid camera.  You need a Polaroid?  Camera.  Buy a Polaroid.  Oh, yeah.  Damn it.  Polaroid camera. 
[02:51:00]  I think they're cheap.  You could buy them at like Dwayne Reed.  You want to bring them down to the street and see if we can make money?  You would be on the bullhorn going, step right up, get the photo op with half a Hulk face.  Five bucks and you keep the shot and it all goes to you.  And we'll do it on the homeless shopping spree, too, because...  Yeah, well, we'll start it today.  We've got to work it out in the lab and then we'll develop it further.  Here at the Institute.  Here at the Institute, right.  The Opie and Anthony Institute.  Sharpie.  Can we get a Polaroid camera somewhere? 
[02:51:30]  Dwayne Reed?  All right, let's get that done.  Any money?  How much is a Polaroid camera?  All expensive.  All right.  All right, let's get that done.  All right, for the people in the area, right outside XM, you can get pictures with half a Hulk face for five dollars a shot.  If you want to give them a little more, that would be very nice.  It is the holiday season, after all.  Stupid Tower Records only paying them $60 a day.  What, what, what?  What?  I'm going to use the bullhorn.  Yeah.  Well, Danny's going to use the bullhorn.  Okay, give me some Lysol.  I'll disinfect it for Danny, and then he can do the same for me. 
[02:52:00]  What is fucking Pacino doing?  How much work has Al Pacino had done on himself?  Paper towels, tote, please.  Will do.  Is he doing that?  Oh, my God.  What?  Let me see.  It doesn't look like Al Pacino anymore.  Can I ask you something, Jimmy?  What is this magazine?  It's called Shock Science.  It's pretty, oh, Shock.  It's pretty cool, actually.  I like this.  Let me see if it's Pacino. 
[02:52:30]  Let me see if it's Pacino.  Let me see if it's Pacino, yeah.  It's a funny thing.  They have look-alikes.  They have Pacino over Rue McClanahan.  That's a pretty funny look-alike.  Pass it along, Sam, before you get a kiss.  Come on, Sam.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What is with Pacino?  I don't know.  He looks like a Hepburn in 64.  Whoa.  Is that a bomb if you're met by human indifference?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That went beyond a bomb.  Yeah.  Like, it was almost like I spoke in a vacuum of space, and it didn't hit anybody's eardrums. 
[02:53:00]  The sad part is someone was laughing out there.  No, they weren't.  They enjoyed it.  I actually realized that not one human who heard that left.  All right.  Why don't we regroup here?  So, Half Hulk Face is hitting the streets of New York, right outside XM.  If you're in the area, $5 a shot with Half Hulk Face, okay?  We wish you had a Santa hat or something, just to make it festive.  Well, get him a Santa hat, Hope.  I think that the Opie Anthony Show can afford that.  I got him over there, Dwayne Reed.  Yeah, get him a Santa hat at Dwayne Reed.  And photo ops with Half Hulk Face. 
[02:53:30]  And we're going to try to raise some money for him starting today.  We'll do it tomorrow.  We'll do it Friday, if you're in the area.  Screw Tower Records.  We'll make you a lot more money than they'll pay you.  Absolutely.  Those chislers.  Oh, yeah.  And then Homeless Shopping Spree.  He's going to be part of that on Saturday.  But this is the deal.  If you're in the area, XM Studios here in New York, 111 West 57th Street.  Yeah, Half Hulk Face will be on the sidewalk with Danny.  Right.  And Danny will be yelling through the bullhorn to see if he can get any takers.  Okay?  Perfect.  We'll break and we'll continue in just a bit.  Thank you. 
[02:54:00]  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Network, it's the Jim Norton No Request Show.  That's me, Jim Norton, folks.  Play some Grateful Dead, man.  Jerry Garcia sat on a stool.  He was awful.  Dude, can you play some Winnie Crabbit?  Come on, stop.  Walks around with his dumb shades and he's a hipster and he's snaked.  You'll request it.  Chances are, he hates it.  Other bands are boring.  Nirvana.  Shut it, you dope.  Led Zeppelin.  Garbage.  You too.  I hate bandwagon bands like you two that are going to sit there and preach politics. 
[02:54:30]  It's all Ozzy all the time.  One of the best live performers on earth.  He's dyslexic.  It doesn't matter.  He's a maniac on stage.  That's the beauty of him.  Remember, if Ozzy didn't sing it.  One word answer.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  You stink horrible.  My boyfriend's going to kill us both unless you play Limp Bizkit.  So what?  Let him do it.  Oh, brother.  Weekday mornings from 3 to 3.15.  Fine.  I don't care.  Hey, it's the O.P. and Anthony Shoe. 
[02:55:00]  Have a Hulk face.  He's going to hit the streets of New York to do some photo ops for people.  People are already bitching.  Oh, look.  I don't want a Polaroid.  We understand that.  We've got to start somewhere.  When we do it tomorrow or Friday, you can bring your own camera.  Yeah.  Bring your own camera.  For the next couple of days, right?  You'll be hanging with us? 
[02:55:30]  Have a Hulk face to collect some money?  So we're...  P-B-N-J.  P-B-N-J.  He thinks I can read his lips.  Are you insane?  Yeah.  First of all, you have to turn your head sideways, and then maybe I can read your lips.  P-B-N-J.  P-B-N-J.  Someone's enjoying his P-B-N-J.  P-B-N-J.  And then someone is suggesting DJ ain't a light bulb.  He's good for one every day.  Yeah.  You should take Have a Hulk face to glamour shots during the homeless shopping spree.  Oh, my God.  Glamour shots.  That will happen. 
[02:56:00]  Macho time from Massachusetts.  What's up?  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  All right.  All right.  I got a little Christmas song just for Jimmy.  All right.  All right.  It goes to the tune of Silent Night.  Okay.  Go.  Ready?  Yep.  Golden showers, 500 an hour.  Jimmy seeks yellow treats.  Soft, young ebony, tender and sweet.  Might be a tranny. 
[02:56:30]  Look at them feet.  Seeking ebony's pee.  Seeking ebony's pee.  Jimmy lies in the tub.  Gives his manhood a tug.  Oh, my God.  She dropped a log.  What can he do but grin and bear it?  Smells so stinky.  The neighbors can share it.  Seeking ebony's pee.  Drinking ebony's mule. 
[02:57:00]  Um, not long enough.  It's the holidays.  And I also have a response to you.  It's, uh, in the form of the little drummer boy.  All right.  You stuck rump-a-pum-pum.  Does anybody have done the last thing?  You know what?  I gotta do something to bring the funny back into the show.  Oh, come on now.  I have to do something to bring the funny back into the show.  You gotta celebrate Ramadan.  Oh, God. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I brought in the peanut butter to share with everybody.  I was making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for everybody.  Oh, God damn you.  Jimmy just pulled out his cock and laid it into the jar of peanut butter.  And then the jelly.  You missed the jelly.  Oh, the jelly, too?  Oh, they're both wonderful.  Now they are yours.  I brought in a whole loaf of bread. 
[02:58:00]  No one else is having peanut butter and jelly now.  I wanted everyone to treat themselves to peanut butter and jelly.  Treat yourselves.  He just fucking laid his dick right into both jars.  Oh, my God.  Who needs $10?  One scoop of peanut butter, $10.  I am so glad I hate peanut butter and jelly.  It's the first thing I thought of when I saw those jars.  What a great place for my dick.  You're an animal. 
[02:58:30]  You're just an animal.  Holy shit.  Put your cock in my peanut butter.  My stomach hurts.  I'm so happy with myself.  Did Danny hit the streets to get the Polaroid and all that?  He's getting the supplies.  That is...  Oh, you ready to go?  Funny.  What happened?  He what?  What?  He...  Come in.  Danny's, like, making, like, sign language or something.  What's up, Danny?  Hey, Danny.  I just got to open it and get it ready to go. 
[02:59:00]  Good boy.  It's in one of those packages you need, like, scissors.  Now, they seal everything in plastic now to the point where you cannot fucking open it.  You need, like, a razor blade or scissors.  A razor blade or scissors.  And you're really in danger of fucking yourself up.  Absolutely.  Because not only is the implement you're using to open the plastic sharp, but the plastic  itself, where you have cut it, becomes razor sharp.  So, if you try then ripping it open, you're hurting yourself.  Then once you do that, there are eight million twist ties tying things, fastening it to the 
[02:59:30]  plastic that it is encased in.  Is this necessary?  No.  Thank you.  Hey, someone must eat a peanut butter...  Peanut.  Peanut.  Or...  He said it that way.  Someone must eat a peanut butter and Jimmy Cox sandwich.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Nice.  Pick a big hair out of there.  Craig would probably...  A big hair?  Oh, of course.  Not off of my crotch.  Not off of that cock.  Who would do it? 
[03:00:00]  Craig, probably?  $10 for a scoop of peanut butter out of the...  $10.  Hey, look, I'll put my peanut butter...  What is this?  Fucking Taiwan?  I'll put my...  Vietnam?  I'll actually put peanut butter on my dick and let a pretty girl lick it off.  I'll sacrifice.  Wow.  Craig, would you take a scoop of the peanut butter now that Jimmy put his cock in it?  If you really want me to.  We do.  The guys that you got working here are amazing.  They really are good eggs.  I'll pay him because I wasted about $10 worth of food. 
[03:00:30]  I'll pay him.  They're too eager, these kids.  I know.  He actually suggested I do that first and then came in and ate it.  Swing and a miss.  No, it was very funny.  We enjoyed the whole game where we have to convince you.  We don't have to convince anybody anymore.  No, they're easy.  They just want the job so bad.  Right.  They take his fingers.  Two fingers?  Everyone's saying you're ripping off Eastside Dave.  What do you mean, oh yeah?  I don't...  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  You fucked a jar of jelly. 
[03:01:00]  Well, let me explain some of you.  All right.  I know who Eastside Dave is.  Yeah.  Rest assured, I never heard that.  And I certainly wouldn't just...  I didn't fuck the jelly jar.  I just dropped my dick in it to be gross because it's my friend's peanut butter.  Now, how is it...  What exactly did Eastside Dave do?  He became erect and had sex with a jar of jelly.  And I had sex with a jar of jelly.  I don't know if it was a good thing.  And how is that in any way, shape, or form ripping off...  Or us ripping it off when Jimmy put his dick in peanut butter and one of the guys are going 
[03:01:30]  to now eat some of the peanut butter in the jar?  Yeah.  How is that in any way ripping off Eastside Dave fucking a jar of jelly?  I didn't say it was ripping.  That was not me who suggested it was...  You sure chimed in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was just...  You went like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, yeah.  They said, what does that mean?  And then I said, this is what happened.  He's not ripping him off.  No, I would hope not.  I can tell you in 100% honesty, I have not heard that.  Of course not. 
[03:02:00]  And if I...  Let me ask you a question, anyone out there.  Does anybody think that I would hear that and then steal it on the show where right before  them?  There's two shows on XM, us and them.  I would have to say yes.  You're right.  But I want to know if anybody else thought that.  All right.  No, actually, it's a very old...  You know where I got the idea to do that from?  Baudsville.  A John Fox joke.  Years ago, John did a very funny joke about him and his roommate, and he had milk, and  his roommate said, the milk's...  Something about this is my milk, and the roommate put his dick in the milk and said, the milk's 
[03:02:30]  mine.  And I went, you can count on that, poncho.  It's an old John Fox joke, and I saw that peanut butter, and I thought, what a place for  my cock.  Put your cock right in.  Absolutely.  Now, Craig is studying the peanut butter.  If he doesn't do it now, I'm going to throw a cowbell at him.  Jimmy, you have to do it again, though, in front of him.  Well, we got the video camera rolling.  Jimmy doesn't put his dick on a camera.  Yeah, I don't put my dick on a camera.  I don't want the dick on camera, but just the...  Oh, like from a back shot?  Right. 
[03:03:00]  You're going to direct it like softcore hotel porno?  I just got to be very discreet about this.  Of course you do.  I don't love...  Just get from behind me.  What are you doing?  You're not trying to get in the front.  Put his fucking...  Look at him on his knees like he's...  T-Roc's got his I Love Peanut Butter shirt on.  All right.  Walking right in front of you.  Yeah, and fucking...  Fucking...  Bill's got his glasses on.  He's squinting.  Easy in there.  He looks like Dahmer right before he smashed that boy and dragged him back into the house.  All right.  I just...  I got to be very careful what I do on camera.  He's got a bar of chocolate in his mouth.  He's hoping to do a Reese's commercial. 
[03:03:30]  Nothing.  All right.  The dick is going into the peanut butter.  Oh.  There's a helmet marked in there.  All right.  There's a helmet.  All right.  All right.  Get the spoon.  There's a helmet marked in there.  Oh, God damn it.  Jimmy got some of his pee hole because he's white.  Oh, fuck.  Hold on.  Oh, that is not right.  Erick, can you spit on my finger?  Nothing.  Is there really a helmet?  Let me ask you a question.  What?  I got my car bell here. 
[03:04:00]  How does a joke bomb when I'm on my pants down and I'm rubbing peanut butter off of my dick?  How do I bomb?  Wow, that's happening.  All right.  Where's the spoon?  We got to do this.  Can I use a piece of bread?  Did you get the helmet print?  Film the helmet print.  That wasn't there.  That's the helmet print?  Yeah.  There's a helmet fucking print.  All right.  Where's the spoon?  Where's the...  Good.  Could someone get a fucking spoon?  We have ten people that work for this show.  Get a goddamn spoon. 
[03:04:30]  All right, Iraq.  I'm not going to rip off them, so you take this back where it was.  Get at it.  Butcher, thank you for the spoon.  There you go.  Only Ronnie can do that right.  I missed it completely.  Jimmy, you get to scoop out the peanut butter.  Scoop out the helmet print.  You bet I will.  There you go.  There's the...  There's right where you...  There's right where you're...  No, I'm going to feed it to you.  That's gay.  Exactly.  That's right where the...  You know what?  ...dick print was. 
[03:05:00]  Put that back in.  I don't like this kid's attitude.  Oh, wow.  I don't like this kid's attitude.  Are you going to feed him the peanut butter?  No, I'm not.  He's putting it on his ass.  That's fucking horrible.  He scraped it on his ass.  Oh, I can't...  No, I can't...  He farted in it.  Oh, you farted right in the jar.  All right, now give him a scoop.  There you go.  20 bucks.  Same scoop.  There you go.  There it is. 
[03:05:30]  There you go.  I gasped right on it.  You smell that, Iraq?  Enjoy it.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Holy fucking stink.  Oh, my God.  Wow, it stinks so fucking bad in here now.  Go ahead.  Have some peanut butter, son.  It's good for you.  Here's Craig.  Go ahead, Craig.  I gasped right on that, too.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, his dick print was in that.  And then he farted on it. 
[03:06:00]  I didn't like that kid's sass.  Yeah.  I like you, Craig, but you had to be straightened out.  Wow.  Anybody gives him water, they're fired.  That is amazing.  Is it sticking to the roof of your mouth?  Yeah.  Dude, I fucking gassed right into that jar.  The places that cock has been.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Wow.  There you go.  Ooh.  How's the peanut butter?  It's pretty good.  It tastes like peanut butter.  It just tastes like peanut butter.  It doesn't taste like a fork.  With a dick print in it.  All right. 
[03:06:30]  Wow.  There's no, you don't have to talk him into it anymore.  No.  Let's say hi to Holly in Delaware.  Holly, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to let you know that I'm from Delaware and there's a radio station here that's  ripping off your Fatty Pig Pet Fatty Contest.  What are they calling it?  I don't think they really have a name for it, but they just, they announced any large women  to come into their studio and get weighed and the largest would get the money.  But they only did a dollar a pound. 
[03:07:00]  Dollar.  So they had a dollar.  They were pretty cheap about it.  Yeah.  And so they had a 540 pound woman come in.  Yeah.  Very good.  And so there are some hacks that I just wanted to let you know.  Well, is that the, I don't know if it's a ripoff or not, to be honest with you, because  I mean, it's like, are we the first ones to ever weigh people?  Yes.  You're right.  Well, there's an old.  Of course you are.  There's a bit that a lot of morning zoos did.  It's called Fat Tuesday.  And they have fat girls come in on Tuesday and then the fattest girl wins a prize. 
[03:07:30]  All right.  It's not right.  Well, we stole it.  So everything's ripped off anyway.  All right.  Thanks, Holly.  You're welcome.  Punching out.  Let's say hi to Charles in Georgia.  Charles?  Oh, and hey.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  You know, I never would have called y'all guys shock jocks until today.  It's the only word that will describe turning on your radio.  The first thing you hear is the dick prints going into the peanut butter.  It's leaving a nice print. 
[03:08:00]  My God, guys.  What the hell is going on today?  It's called sexy, sir.  Get used to it.  Bringing the sexy back to the show.  We keep it hot here.  Only you, Jimmy.  Wow.  All right, Charles.  All right.  Hey, let's go to Chris in Michigan.  Chris?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Chris.  Yeah.  Jimmy's dick and the intern eating the peanut butter.  Gay or funny?  Funny.  Yeah.  Funny, yeah.  There's really nothing gay about that.  Yeah, I didn't have a rod.  I wish I had a rod.  I would have dug it fucking six inches deep into that fucking jar. 
[03:08:30]  Big fucking mine shaft in the peanut butter jar.  And then maybe we get Patty in here to lick it off and lady die.  Oh, we could play a round of gay or funny.  But that was definitely funny.  You're lucky, Chris.  I wouldn't do it if it was gay.  All right.  No.  Thank you, Chris.  I'll point it out, boys.  All right.  Wow.  Can I take a moment?  He really took no coaxing whatsoever.  All right.  Is Danny ready to go outside with half a hog face?  Oh, there you are.  I'm sorry, Danny.  Hey, Danny, what's this about before you leave? 
[03:09:00]  Because we're going to play this as you get set up.  The Verizon thing?  Oh, yeah.  Basically, you know how you guys like to talk about just, like, terrible customer service?  Well, this is audio of a guy who's basically trying to resolve a dispute on his bill.  They keep quoting him a roaming rate of cents, and he got charged in dollars.  And he goes through about three different customer service people explaining it as clear as day,  and they still can't get it right.  The customer has this right.  Yeah, absolutely.  And the customer service cannot distinguish dollars from cents, no matter how much this guy tries to explain. 
[03:09:30]  Because they're dealing with, like, fractions here.  So, you know, the idiot customer service people just have no idea how to even fathom this.  This is Verizon?  Yeah.  Oh, that's beautiful.  All right, get outside and have Hulk face.  Will do.  Let's try to make him some money.  Make sure you've got the bullhorn.  All right, yeah, so let's check this out.  Customer asked Rep if he understands the difference between $0.002 and $0.002.  Rep says no and then says it's the same. 
[03:10:00]  Wow.  I love it.  Looks like you're questioning the kilobyte usage that was done while in Canada.  Well, let me just start out with a basic question.  Okay.  Do you recognize that there's a difference between $0.002 and $0.002?  Do you recognize that there's actually...  $0.002?  Yes.  Do you recognize there's a difference between those two numbers? 
[03:10:30]  No.  Okay.  Is there a difference between $0.002 and $0.002?  Well, yes, there is.  Okay.  So is there a difference between $0.002 and $0.002?  $0.002 and $0.002.  Yes.  Is there a difference between...  They're both the same if you look at them on paper-wise.  No, they're not, actually.  If you look at them on paper-wise...  Well, wait a minute now.  Like $0.002 looks the same as $0.002. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  But if it's dollars...  How do you know if it's dollars, though?  I'm only...  I'm guessing on his bill it probably said something like that.  Where would you see...  But I'm not good at math.  Where would you see $0.002?  Probably be $0.002 with a dollar sign before the point.  I don't understand how...  I'm sure the guy's right, but I don't know how he's right. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, but why is he saying that anyway?  That's what the dispute is?  I am really lost on this.  Yeah, me too.  Is that the whole thing?  No, it goes on.  Let's see if we can understand this.  Maybe someone can help us.  I'm thinking maybe it's like he should be getting charged $0.002 for some kilobyte of usage thing.  Right.  But he's getting charged $0.002.  So his bill is 100 times more than it should be.  100 times more?  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, okay.  So we probably noticed that.  Yeah.  It's not like you can...  All right.  Let's continue.  Let's take 100 times.  National roaming access coverage in Canada is $0.002 per kilobyte cents.  Can you say that again?  It's $0.002 cents per kilobyte.  $0.002 cents per kilobyte.  So you just quoted me again.  Your price is $0.002 cents per kilobyte. 
[03:12:30]  Correct.  Okay.  So now I'd like you to translate my 35,893 kilobytes into dollars for me, if you would.  Okay.  So if you take .002 cents, remember, if it's cents, times $35,896 is $71.79.  No, that would be 71 cents.  Wait a minute.  Oh, boy. 
[03:13:00]  Wait a minute.  Oh, boy.  I'm lost.  It's math.  It's $0.002 a kilobyte.  It's .002 cents a kilobyte.  Oh, I'm lost.  It's not even two cents?  No.  It's .002 cents?  Yeah.  It's a fraction of a cent per kilobyte.  Oh, okay.  That's where I was lost.  Okay.  And the guy is charging him a fraction of a dollar.  Right. 
[03:13:30]  Wow.  I was lost.  Is this even worth playing?  Yeah.  I feel like I'm back in, like, 11th grade.  It is because what happens is when you deal with these phone companies, and I've had problems  too, it's like they're impossible to deal with.  Because the people don't even understand what they're talking about.  And they don't give a shit.  That's why it's great to embarrass them publicly.  Then they do something.  What does the .002 represent?  Cents or dollars?  Cents, sir.  Okay.  .002 cents.  So, basically, you're paying two-tenths of a penny per kilobyte. 
[03:14:00]  Two-tenths of a penny would be .2 cents.  You quote it to be .002 cents.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Two-tenths of one cent would be .2 cents.  You quoted me .002 cents.  That's correct.  There's a difference between .2 cents and .002 cents. 
[03:14:30]  They're 100 times different.  So, which is the real rate?  .002, sir.  .002 what?  .002 cents per kilobyte.  Holy crap.  See, there's a major confusion here as to .002 being the number and .002 being a dollar amount.  Like, one dollar would be 1.00.  .00, right.  And then he's looking at 1.02 would be .002 cents, and then a dollar and two cents. 
[03:15:00]  And then 1.002 would be $1.00 and . . .  Two-one-hundredths.  Yeah, two-one-hundredths of a cent.  Chris in the Bronx.  What's up, guys?  Yo, this is harder than Chinese algebra.  Oh, God.  Is that a funny joke?  I'm the master.  That's funny. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Take it out, boys.  Thank you.  Dude, I'm getting that feeling, though.  Do we have to continue?  I want to know how this is involved.  I love to see the phone companies.  This is Andrew.  I'm the manager on the floor.  How can we help you today?  Hi.  I think we've got a terminology and mathematics problem going on here, and it seems very basic  to me, but I think we're just having a problem because of the numbers involved.  Okay.  Just to summarize, I was quoted, before I entered Canada, I was quoted .002 cents per kilobyte.  Okay. 
[03:16:00]  .002 cents per minute is what's quoted to me.  My bill reflects .002 dollars per minute.  What do you mean, .002 dollars?  Oh, no.  Okay.  I think I have to do this again.  Do you recognize that there's a difference between $1 and 1 cent?  Definitely.  Do you recognize that there's a difference between half a dollar and half a cent?  Definitely. 
[03:16:30]  Then, do you therefore recognize that there's a difference between .002 dollars and .002 cents?  No.  I have no idea what's going on.  Oh, my God.  He's saying two one-hundredths of a penny, two one-hundredths of a dollar is two cents.  Right.  Two one-hundredths of a penny is what he was quoted, so they are a hundred times a fraction.  Yeah, they're a hundred times a fraction.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no .002 dollars. 
[03:17:00]  Of course there is.  It's two.  Of course there is.  This is what you're quoted, and that's what I do show that you paid, or that, you know,  you're paying for the kilobytes you said.  Okay.  I don't know a better way to express this.  .002 dollars is the same as .2 cents.  Okay.  Well, how would you, what would .002 dollars look to you?  I would be a dollar is one decimal zero zero, right? 
[03:17:30]  So what would a .002 dollars look like?  I don't know.  I've never heard of .002 dollars.  .002 cents, that's not a full cent.  It's just, it's just math we're talking about.  It's not a full cent.  That's right.  And, that's right.  And .002 cents is also not a full cent.  My point here is .002 dollars, if you do the math, is .002 cents.  It's one one-hundredth difference. 
[03:18:00]  There's a hundred cents and a dollar.  But you were quoted .002 cents, not .002 dollars.  That's correct.  But what I was charged...  .002 cents is .002.  Dollars?  .002 cents.  .002 cents.  She doesn't get it.  There's the math part of it and the dollar denomination part of it. 
[03:18:30]  You got to look at it as math.  As like .002 out of a cent being...  He's not doing a great job of explaining it, though.  He's getting confusing, too.  But he's getting so aggravated that the way he's like, oh, how am I going to do this?  Oh, my gosh.  He's so annoyed.  All right.  Now the floor manager starts to talk to the customer like he's the idiot.  I'm teaching math here.  And I, I mean, I'm trying to get what you're saying here, but it's just not... 
[03:19:00]  Here's the...  Let me cut to the chain.  I already talked to a few different people.  Let me cut to the chain.  Well...  ...to you that you're being billed .002 cents.  And I mean, you take...  I'm not being billed...  ...on your calculator.  It shows you that it's...  No, it doesn't.  I can do...  We never said that you're going to get billed .002 cents.  That's right.  You said I was going to get billed .002 cents per kilobyte, and I'd be happy to pay that. 
[03:19:30]  Now, why don't you bring up your calculator?  Yeah.  Take .002, and we're talking about cents, right?  Right.  .002.  If we multiply that by the amount of kilobyte usage that you have...  3, 5, 8, 9, 3.  3, 5, 8, 9, 3.  That comes out to what you paid, $71.79.  Which is...  Which is...  No, it's supposed to be $7 or something like that.  Or 70 cents.  71 cents. 
[03:20:00]  71 cents.  It should be 71 cents instead of $71.  Oh, my God.  Right?  Yep.  I don't think the company knows what they're charging or how to word it.  Who knows?  That's confusing.  What happened?  Wow.  Is that the end of it?  Yeah.  What was his number?  I'll do the math here.  No, don't do the math.  I want to.  It's 35,000-ish.  Yeah.  That's how much.  35,000.  Units.  Units of...  Of things. 
[03:20:30]  Things.  Of widgets.  Of widgets.  35,000 widgets.  Each widget is .002 cents.  It's a fraction of a cent.  It's a fraction of a cent.  Not the dollar amount.  So how many .002s make a dollar?  Which would be...  How do I move this around?  I don't know how to move my BlackBerry.  .001 would be a pound.  Two.  Why does anyone say, please put this audio file on the site?  That's not that great, is it?  This has been getting downloaded, dude, like crazy. 
[03:21:00]  Why?  I don't get it.  It's people love hearing customer service people.  Being dumb.  For some reason, people enjoy it when it's not them, because it's them so much that they  love hearing when somebody's wrong.  It would be .002 of a dollar.  Maybe that's what he meant.  .002 is two one-thousandths of a cent.  Yes, that's correct.  What am I doing?  How does this fucking work? 
[03:21:30]  Ah, Jimmy's free.  I can't even get the calculator to work.  I don't know how to move things around on my BlackBerry.  I don't know how to operate my BlackBerry.  It's a BlackBerry.  Oh, we were out to dinner last night.  We were having fruit, and she had, my girl had a fucking bowl full of fruit, and she had  some blueberries, so I took them on my fork.  I was taking some of hers, and I went, blueberries.  And she snatched my fork, and took her fingers, and scooped the blueberries onto the table and  threw the fork, because I said blueberries. 
[03:22:00]  I didn't get any in my mouth, because I said blueberries.  So you had to order more fruit?  I was punished for saying blueberries.  She just grabbed it, and she took her hand and went, fruit!  And like six blueberries fell off onto the table, and then she threw the fork down and  spoiled my mouth full.  She's going to smack you in the face.  You know, I talk to a lot of people about this show, and they really think we smoke pot 
[03:22:30]  because of these dumb conversations we have.  Good for them.  That we just giggle by saying, I see.  Blueberry.  You got it figured out, Jimmy?  Oh, did you?  I don't know yet.  I'm doing the best I can, for Christ's sake.  $35,000?  I hate math now.  Oh, I don't like mathematics.  It's very difficult.  Where's the time sign?  Especially when you can't convey it to somebody on customer service.  So he got charged $71, and he should have been charged...  $0.71.  Where's the time sign?  Are you sure it's that easy? 
[03:23:00]  It should be.  All right.  It should be.  All right.  Although, doesn't $0.71 sound pretty cheap?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think the guy was getting away with...  But the problem was, he was being quoted.  He's quoted a certain rate.  They didn't know how to quote him the appropriate rate.  Yes.  So they fucked up by...  And he was just trying to take advantage of it.  And he's taking advantage of it.  And by all rights, he should have, because they were quoting the wrong rate.  Yeah, you're quoting the wrong rate.  $0.002 is how many?  That's not two cents.  $0.002, no, is...  What am I doing? 
[03:23:30]  ...two tenths of a cent.  Correct.  It's two tenths of a cent.  They need five of those to make a cent.  Right.  Right.  But that's different than even what he was saying, right?  I don't know.  Yes.  Some stupid...  Because he's talking .002 of a cent.  Yes.  Which is even smaller.  Yes.  That's a ridiculously small amount.  Is it?  It is.  And I think they knew what they were... 
[03:24:00]  How did they fucking work?  Well...  That takes, like, a lot to make up a cent.  Yes, it takes 500.  .002 of a cent takes 500 of those to make a penny.  Wait a minute.  35 is...  Instead of .002 of a dollar, which takes only two to make a penny.  Five?  Five to make a penny.  I can't operate my fucking BlackBerry calculator.  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Jimmy can't work his calculator.  I don't know how to use the BlackBerry calculator. 
[03:24:30]  Is that a BlackBerry?  It certainly is.  How come there's, like, a phone-like now?  They're not flat and wide.  That's not a newer one, either.  They're thinner than that now.  Yeah, I know.  This is not the newest one.  I like this one.  They're even thinner than that.  How do I...  Where's the fucking...  Stan, can you find the multiplication sign?  I'll give you a nickel.  As long as you stop yelling.  All right.  All right, can we take a break?  I think we need one.  Guys.  Oh, I think we need one.  I gotta go and I gotta take a leak.  Take a leak.  Why don't wipe the peanut butter off? 
[03:25:00]  It's pee-pee time.  Where's Danny?  Why isn't he calling in?  Is he ready?  You know what that is gonna...  You know your underwear is going to have peanut butter stains on the front?  Yeah.  Which is really embarrassing.  You better drive and walk around so safely.  Because God forbid something happens to you and they pull off your underpants and you have brown shit-looking substance on your cock in front of your underwear.  Who gives a crap about that old wise tale?  And they'll squeeze my cock. 
[03:25:30]  They do.  They don't, man.  A little peanut butter will come out.  And they'll see the raspberry jelly and they'll think that I buggered someone.  Buggered someone.  Jesus.  They'll think I buggered a gentleman and got butt jelly.  That's, by the way, what they call it in porn.  Belladonna was telling a story to Naomi, the two chicks before they did the scene, about someone doing some ass fingering.  And she's like, yeah, and he was fingering the ass and some butt jelly shot up.  Butt jelly.  Let's go down the street.  Danny's down there with half a Hulk face.  Danny, what's going on? 
[03:26:00]  Hey, guys.  Well, we're just on the side of 57th, right in front of the XM Studios, waiting for people to show up who would like their picture taken with half a Hulk face.  Are you asking strangers?  I'm sorry?  Strangers.  Okay, I'm going to do that with the bullhorn, although I think it's illegal.  Do you have a sign?  No, well, I think half a Hulk face is pretty much the sign himself.  The sign?  Yeah.  We need a sign.  Yeah, I think a colorful sign would work better.  But, yeah, you've got to be like a carnival barker with the bullhorn.  I can try and do that.  And say, take a picture with half a Hulk face. 
[03:26:30]  All right, hang on.  Step right up.  Step right up.  Take your picture with half a Hulk face.  He's an oddity.  Look at the tumors on his face.  Here's your chance to have a picture with the half a Hulk face.  Only $5.  Wow.  How's that?  Not bad.  Not bad.  You sound very carnival barker-ish.  Should I say hear ye or something?  Yeah, hear ye, hear ye.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Ladies and gentlemen. 
[03:27:00]  Children of all ages.  Yes.  Shwoogies of all ages.  The children.  I can't say that right now.  No.  Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages.  Step right up.  It's your chance to have your picture taken with half a Hulk face.  He turned English.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry.  Look at his giant tumor and have a Polaroid snapped with it.  Yours for only $5.  Any takers?  No, people are very uninterested. 
[03:27:30]  What costs $5?  Say for the price of, you know, a couple Starbucks coffees.  How many kilobits is that?  Wait, 0.02 per Hulk face photo.  So, if, uh, yeah, for the cost of a cup of gourmet coffee.  For less than the price of a gourmet Starbucks coffee, a picture with half a Hulk face can  be yours for the mere price of $5.  Sir, less than a pack of cigarettes can net you a picture with the half a Hulk face. 
[03:28:00]  Only $5.  Sir, would you like a picture with half a Hulk face?  No, thanks, man.  Sir, would you like a picture with half a Hulk face?  No, thank you.  But look at his face.  It's half a Hulk.  Dumb, Danny.  God.  Got no takers.  Would you like a picture with half a Hulk face?  Only $5.  When else are you going to see with a guy with tumors in his face?  No one.  Miss.  I can't even get anybody to look at me at this point. 
[03:28:30]  This, you know, we have a good charitable idea.  I'm getting yelled at by the building.  I've got to walk down the building.  Oh, the stupid building.  Building.  Which guy was yelling at you?  Your favorite, Jimmy.  Who is that cocksucker behind the desk?  Or the jerk off who looks like Mr. Whipple with bloody child's underpants in his pocket?  No, it's your favorite.  It's the abortion with a tie.  One guy behind the desk.  That's why I hate him.  You can't even use a bullhorn to have tumor face photographed.

Hey, someone's suggesting that you yell pro-choice. 
[03:33:30]  This is why you should be pro-choice.  Miss, miss, miss.  This is why we should have pro-choice in this country.  Do you agree?  Would you like to contribute $5 to the Save Golf Ball Face charity?  No, thank you, she says.  Did we get the one picture taken so far?  Yes, and he contributed very nicely to the fund.

Aborted fetus face.  Nobody is amused.  No.  Not one.  Plastic surgery gone bad, make-a-wish foundation.  Miss, $5 to have your picture taken with our newest Calvin Klein model. 
[03:34:30]  Only $5.  Miss, can I interest you in giving to charity?  Give this man $5 to have the golf balls removed from his face.  Golf balls.  I guess the feedback is not working all of a sudden.  All right.  Miss, would you like to have your picture taken with this here aborted fetus?  Only $5. 
[03:35:00]  Sir, would you like to have your picture taken with our newest Calvin Klein model?  No.  I like the people's reaction.  No.  No.  No thanks.

Miss, would you like to have your picture taken and make yourself look good with this 
[03:35:30]  guy?  $5.  No, thank you.  He's our new Calvin Klein model.  Would you like to have a picture with him?  No.  This guy?  Yeah.  What do you think about him?  What does he look like?  That guy over there.  He looks weird.  He looks weird.  Why?  I don't know.  Are you a relative of Borat?  Yes.  Do we have to sign away our lives now?  Yes.  She's trying to be funny.  Tell him to take a picture with this man.  His face is full of cunt meat. 
[03:36:00]  I'll do it if I can get through it without laughing first.  Go ahead.  All right.  Shut up!  I'm doing a radio show here.  Ladies and gentlemen, $5.  Have your picture taken with this gentleman.  Whose face is full of cunt meat.  Miz, can I interest you in a picture with old cunt meat face? 
[03:36:30]  Oh, my God.  $5.  We've jammed the answer feedback.  People are loving it.  Oh, shit.  We can't get it to work.  Holy shit.  Any good ones coming off Pal Talk?  Because I can't help Danny out.  I don't have any answer.  I might have to go.  There's a cop making a U-E.  Cunt meat.  Is he really making a U-E?  Yeah, actually.  I'm just going to start casually walking the other way.  Yeah.  Maybe run.  Yeah. 
[03:37:00]  If you have to throw half a Hulk face at him.  Wait, is the cop gone?  Yeah, he was just making a laugh.  I thought he was coming all the way around.  Ask him.  Say, hey, flat foot.  Now he's gone.  All right.  Let's just put this.  A lousy screw.  We've got to get him more money here.  We'll have everyone bring their digital cameras tomorrow.  Miss, we're trying to raise money to get this gentleman plastic surgery to remove the cancer from his face.  Can I interest you in a picture with the man for $5?  $5.  No.  Hey, Danny, I've got a new one. 
[03:37:30]  Sure.  Do the same pitch you just did, and when they say no, just freaking curse him out for being bad humans.  And go back to your rosy life, selfish.  It's five lousy fucking dollars.  What's that to you?  Yeah.  Look at this man.  He's scaring children.  Yeah, exactly.  As you could imagine, people are trying to avoid me at all costs.  All right, you'll get another group coming your way.  Old Play-Doh face.  Miss, we're trying to raise money for this gentleman to have all the cancer removed from his face. 
[03:38:00]  He needs plastic surgery in a terrible way.  Can we take a picture with him for $5?  I'm a turist.  You cunt.  Oh, my God.  Damn it, me coming.  God damn it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I had to run away.  I couldn't even look her in the face. 
[03:38:30]  All right, that works, though.  Let's try another way.  Oh, is that good?  Holy over the top.  But really, just be really disappointed.  Like, I can't believe you can't give this guy a lousy $5, you cheap bastard or whatever.  Sir, we're raising money.  We're trying to get this man some money so he can have plastic surgery.  Half a Hulk face.  Why don't you got to look over his stupid...  Sorry, we're trying to...  Forget it.  Forget it on that one.  He ran away.  Fucking half a Hulk face is watching the TV in the bank. 
[03:39:00]  He understand.  He's got to look at the people.  Yeah.  Miss, we're trying to raise money for this gentleman...  Oh, she's speeding up.  We're trying to raise money for this gentleman to have the cancer removed from his face.  Only $5 to have a picture.  He just needs plastic surgery to have the tumors removed.  Have a good day.  You asshole!  Tell, uh, have a Hulk face to frown.  To help his cause.  He is.  Oh, yeah.  Have a Hulk face.  Can you try and look more...  Sad? 
[03:39:30]  Sad.  I know it's tough, but...  Can you try and do that for us?  Alright.  Like, frown and kind of make, like, the eyes, like, you're pathetic.  Alright.  Alright, do another one.  I love when you just change attitude.  Hang on.  Oh, yeah.  You could ask for, uh, $5 to touch the tumor.  Miss, we're trying to raise money to get this man some plastic surgery so he can get the tumors removed for his face.  Only $5 to touch his tumors.  I don't want to touch him. 
[03:40:00]  Only $5.  Touch the tumors.  Please, only $5 to touch his tumors.  No, thank you.  Fine, go back to your beautiful lives, then.  In your towers.  In your towers?  I don't know.  There was some, uh, some dude that looked like he could have kicked the shit out of me.  Ah.  Hence no C-bomb there.  Yeah, you gotta look for the helpless people.  Yeah, I didn't realize they were with him.  People are suggesting that, uh, we take some, uh, ONA shirts and stuff them over, uh, under his shirt by his shoulder.  So he looks like a hunchback also. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, that's a great idea.  And he can hunch over a little bit.  Just really fuck him up.  All right, maybe someone could run down some t-shirts.  We could definitely pull that off.  I think someone wanted to say, uh, take a picture with the real Mr. Potato Head.  I'll get this stupid iPod person.  All right, here we go.  Miss, only $5.  We're trying to raise money to get the tumors removed from his face.  We have the real Mr. Potato Head.  Can you just please take a picture?  Only $5.  $5?  Yes.  I don't think it's $5. 
[03:41:00]  You don't have $5?  I don't have any cash.  You have an iPod.  You don't have $5?  I don't have cash.  That's the good one.  Take debit?  No.  I gotta get the one.  All right, thanks a lot, you cunt.  Holy shit.  I know, I'm a one-trick pony, but this is kind of fun.  Oh, my God.  It's a hell of a trick, Dan.  It's a good trick.  You cunt.  Dude, wish cancer on them if they don't help you.  Yeah, oh, that's good.  From King of Comedy.  Yeah.  I hope you get cancer. 
[03:41:30]  You should only get cancer.  You can't only get cancer.  If we're trying to raise money to get this gentleman plastic surgery to get the tumors removed  from his face, can we interest you in donating just $5 to help him out?  I hope you get cancer.  Eric had to run away from that one.  No, Danny, you gotta say it like this.  I hope you get cancer.  You should only get cancer.  All right, I'll do that.  I hope you get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  You should only get cancer.  She was not happy.

Could we interest you in just donating just $5 to help him out?  No.  Oh, you should get cancer.  You should.  You should.  No, you're doing good.  I'll try not to get the shit beat out of yourself.  You don't have to yell it.  You have to go like this.  As they're walking away, you go, you should get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  All right. 
[03:42:30]  Remember.  Miss, we're trying to raise money to get this gentleman some plastic surgery so he could  have the cancer removed.  She's running.  So he could have the cancer removed.  Can you help us out?  Just $5.  I hope you get cancer.  You should get cancer.  Cancer of a uterus.  Oh, God damn.  I really thought I'd be summoned by now.

Come on.  Come on.  Oh, I think he's German.  He's used to these type of experiments.  He's seen a few of those gone wrong.  Oopsie.  I was just going for blue eyes.  Trying to get blonde hair.  I could, if you want, I could play the Lala game with some dude on his cell phone with 
[03:43:30]  the bullhorn.  Oh, yes.  I got it.  What is it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's at the bus stop just waiting.  All right.  I'm just going to be really annoying about this, I guess.  He called me an asshole.  I heard it.  Half a Jay Leno.  Sir, can I interest you in a picture with half a Jay Leno face? 
[03:44:00]  No.  What are you saying, Eric?  What does Eric say?  I think he wants me to curse out a four-year-old.  That's good.  Don't do that.  Why?  He's wearing the same clothes as Eric?  Don't curse me.  I just hit him.  Dude, all right.  Someone's got a good line.  You do your basic spiel, and when they tell you no, you go, so I guess a blowjob is out  of the question.  That's Douche Nozzle from Wagbag.  Oh, boy. 
[03:44:30]  All right.  Looking around, looking around.  I can't believe people are avoiding this side of the street.  Gee, I wonder why.  To be perfectly honest with you, there is no one.  No one?  There's no one right now.  Walking down the street?  Nope.  57th in Manhattan.  You're lying.  It's empty.  There's a lady walking down, but it's going to take him about 30 seconds for her to get 
[03:45:00]  over here.  All right.  Half a witch of the West face.  I'll start pitching her.  Mez, could I ask you to contribute just $5 to this man's plastic surgery?  His face is full of cancer.  Do you think that you could help us out with just $5?  Not enough.  Well, then, I guess the blowjobs out of the question.  Wow.  Oh, he has fucking big balls. 
[03:45:30]  A set of fucking balls on this kid.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know how much longer I'm going to feel like pressing my luck out here.  Danny?  Yes.  All right.  What guy at?  Someone's suggesting old catcher's mid-face.  Yes, Jimmy?  Oh.  How about $5 a punch?  We still have the right side of the face.  That's okay. 
[03:46:00]  Ask them if they want to have a photo taken with this man so you can use the money to have  the chewing tobacco taken out of his cheek.  But say tobacco.  Miss, could I ask you to contribute just $5?  Look at this guy over here.  We're trying to raise money.  He needs surgery to get all the tobacco out of his face.  His chewing tobacco face.  I don't have $5.  Oh, shut up.  Well, wait.  She has two.  Because we're really trying to raise money to get this guy some plastic surgery.  Thank you very much, miss.  You have a fantastic day.  Would you like a picture? 
[03:46:30]  We can get you a picture with a little tumor face.  Nope.  All right.  Hey, Danny.  Yeah.  That's too much.  Tell people you're taking money to have a photo taken with him so he can get a prostitute.  All right.  Hang on.  Look this way, dummy.  Look this way.  Miss, we're trying to raise money.  You see this gentleman over here with the cancer in his face?  We're just trying to raise money.  I'm from Rob Wanda job 2 and I'm really tired.  I know.  But we're just trying to get some money so we can get a prostitute.  Can you help us out?  He can't get laid on his own.  Look at his face. 
[03:47:00]  I'm not amused.  People are suggesting that you have half a Hulk face scream, I'm not an animal.  That's a good one.  Will he do it?  Let's see.  Half a Hulk face, would you be able to say and scream, I am not an animal?  No.  Tell him it'll help him get some money.  But it's going to help you get some money, though.  How loud do I got to scream this? 
[03:47:30]  Just that people, when they walk away, say, I am not, I am not an animal.  I'll pitch him with the bullhorn and then as they walk away, you scream, I'm not an animal.  All right, sure, why not?  All right, good.  All right, good, there's some old ladies coming this way, too.  All right, here we go.  Hi, excuse me.  I'm sorry.  We're trying to raise money to get this guy some plastic surgery for the cancer in his face.  Do you think you guys can help us out today?  Just $5.  You can even get a picture with him, too.  No, thank you.  I'm not an animal.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, my God.  Bravo.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, wow.  What do they do?  Oh, they did what everybody else does, just pretend it never happened and keep walking away.  Walk away.  People, oh, some people are suggesting you ask people if they want to bob for tumors in his ear.  Someone get me a portable, I want to go to the window and watch.  And then a portable headset. 
[03:48:30]  All right, hang on.  Hilarious.  Oh.  Hey, sir, we're trying to raise money.  We're trying to raise money to get the cancer out of this guy's face.  We're charging only $5.  You can go bobbing for tumors inside of his mouth.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  No?  You want a picture with him?  We'll give you a Polaroid for $5.  Thanks, man.  S.  S.  S.

Yeah, and then he threw his MetroCard at me like it was going to magically slice my neck open.  Have Hulkface yell that line again about I'm not an animal. 
[03:49:30]  Hang on.  Next person that turns you down.  People are saying you have the biggest balls ever.  Can you scream I am not an animal again?  I'm not an animal!  Ask somebody who says no.  All right, well, let me get somebody.  You got your headphones so you can check it out?  Let's see.  All right, here's one more.  Excuse me, miss.

[03:50:00]  Do you think you could help us out and contribute?  No humble English.  No humble English?  Fuck you.  How about that?  I bet you understood that, huh?  All right, I'm running away.  I'm definitely running away now.  Oh, why?  Is someone threatening you?  Well, no, there's just people around.  All right.  Nice.  Someone's also disappointed we're not going to 11.59 with this so they can get Ronnie when  he comes in for work. 
[03:50:30]  11.59.  You have to wait until 12.02.  12.02, right.  Oh, is it 12.02?  Have a whole face.  Face!  Whole face.  Have a whole face.  Anybody else?  Why can't...  Well, I'm waiting for this one lady to come down.  Can we get a headset for Jimmy?  Yeah.  All right, we're waiting for a woman?  Excuse me, miss.  I was wondering if you could help us out here.

[03:51:00]  And you get a free Polaroid.  Get the fuck away from me now.  Okay.  I am not an animal.  He was too far away.  I don't chase her down a boat.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Get the fuck away from me, she says.  What a potty mouth.  I love her.  I like when Danny says it, but it annoys me when some bitch says it back to Danny.  Yeah, I know.  I don't like Danny being treated rudely.  Right.  Gene from Jersey.  Tell them that the photo will only cost .002 cents.  And then tell them it's $5.  Wait, there's a guy. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, damn.  Someone is suggesting, you say, beat the New Year's rush.  Get your picture taken with Dick Clark today.  Oh, my God.  That's Matt Lafarge.  Oh, is that a good one?

Okay.  $27, I'm sorry.  Oh, wow.  We'll do better tomorrow.  Hey, wait.  We have a taker.  Sir, what's your name?  Shadow812 from FullBallNames.com.  Would you like a picture with half a Hulk face?

You think someone dropped a dirty bomb in front of XM, though?  Make sure I have a Hulk face really shows off that face of his. 
[03:54:00]  Anthony, this is beyond hilarious to see it from above.  Oh, I wish I could see.  There's some old people.  I'm stuck in the studio.  There's old people about 20 feet away.  Excuse me, I'm sorry.  We're trying to raise money for this gentleman right here.  He's got cancer in his face.  Super funny.

And tell him, y'all, I am not a Cucaracha. 
[03:54:30]  Danny has the biggest balls.  Anthony, he follows him right down the sidewalk.  He's not pussing out whatsoever.  He's right behind him with the microphone every single time.  All right, there's no one coming.  There's a lady on a cell phone.  That's a little annoying her.  All right, there's some lady on a cell phone is approaching.  And she stopped.  I think she saw me with the microphone.  Stopped.  Ask this lady with the hat.  Yeah, with the Russian hat.  Hey, diaphragm hat.  Excuse me, diaphragm hat.

All right.  Well, I think you did good, son.  You did a bang-up job.  Thanks, misters.  We got some good video, too. 
[04:06:30]  Sam was down there with his camera.  You got any good shots, Sam?  Sure.  Sure.  I got good shots.  With my camera.  I take pictures.  I move.  With my camera.  With my camera.

[04:07:00]  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll do line of the day, and we'll get the hell out of here.  That was good.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony Show scream-along.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Okay.  Terrific.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's say hi to Christy in New York. 
[04:07:30]  Christy, what's going on today?  I got to tell you, that was the funniest shit I ever heard in my life.  And you need to do it every day.  I got to tell you, just listening in on it was really, really funny to me, but then 
[04:08:00]  when I went to the window to check it out live, it was unbelievable.  He would chase him down the...  I can imagine.  I'm tired.  All those comments were said right to their face.  I know, yeah.  He would chase him right down the sidewalk.  He was relentless.  And I would give him like $100 if I was there.  Oh, cool.  Thank you, Christy.  Danny is baldy.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Can we do line of the day and then get the hell out of here?  Yep.  We have line of the day, sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  It's a fine website.  The Americans are taking on, what, the Russians? 
[04:08:30]  Yes.  In some kind of a...  In a...  About?  Mixed martial arts.  Mixed martial arts.  Docu-reality.  Yeah.  So they're fighting and living like the real world, I guess.  And it's kicking ass.  Sounds pretty cool, actually.  It's all about kicking ass.  Bodogfight.com.  One winner, that's it?  No runner-ups?  We were under...  Yeah.  Understaffed.  I'm hoping that the winner was Young Danny.  That's just my guess.  Oh.  Am I saying?  Okay.  Wow, no.  Well, yeah, well... 
[04:09:00]  Understaffed.  Well, let's hear.  Well, here's...  Song makes it.  This kid's good.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  I better understand this language.  What's up?  Video of the day?  Great car crash chase thing on Fox.  What happened?  Who called his office?  Which one of us, Dan?  Danny, we're trying to get him on. 
[04:09:30]  What was the response?  His office is closed right now, but we're trying to get him on.  Closed?  But maybe we could get him on tomorrow or later this morning.  Yes.  That was it.  Do they deliver?  I don't know if that means it.  Because he's Asian.  Thank you, but I don't know.  Oh, what's the matter?  What's wrong?  You're refusing to accept?  I don't know.  Because of the plight of the American Indian?  No, no, no.  I'm actually going to throw more garbage because I thought his crying was hilarious.  I think Danny should have won. 
[04:10:00]  But when the woman walked away, he went, you cunt.  Yeah, that was a good one.  But I know they're understaffed as Stan said.  It's late in the show.  It makes it a little tougher.  Oh, hey, no.  You know, you're preaching to the choir.  It's just a controversy.  Well, we're going to...  I'm humble.  We've got a meeting and coffee and stuff.  Peanut butter, uh...  Penis in the peanut butter.  Very impressive today.  Yeah, that was good.  That was funny.  Thank you.  Slap this dick right in that jar. 
[04:10:30]  Bet I did.  Nice, like a man.  You bet I did.  Oh, by the way, should we start plugging that we're going to do fucking money snatch?  Huh?  Someday?  We're going to do it Tuesday.  Oh, are we?  We need desperate girls to run out naked and get money.  I don't know if we're going to do it.  Oh, I think we absolutely have to do it.  XM's only giving us $500.  We need...  Maybe we sell, like, spots to check out the show live that day.  Oh.  500 bucks?  Come on, XM.  That's it.  I think the last time we did it, we had a couple thousand. 
[04:11:00]  Damn.  500 bucks?  500.  That ain't going to get you.  Between how many people?  What are they doing?  No.  10 people.  Nothing.  Oh, that's fucking awful.  Yeah.  Usually about 10.  What is that, 71 cents?  And Aunt and I are sick of doling out our own money for bits.  I didn't hear you.  Yeah.  .002 divided by what?  Times what?  That's really, um, silly.  All right, listen, we got to go.  We're just babbling.  All right.  I'm old-faced, thank you.  Start the show right there.  20 bucks for this, kid.  We'll see you, uh...  I'm alright. 
[04:11:30]  Yeah.  I'm alright.  Our duties do do do do.  Our duties do do do.  Our duties do do.  Have destructive power.  You think it stinks now.  You should have seen it a month ago.  The Anthony Show.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.  If you'd like to vote on any of the weekly show polls, go to iliketolisten.com. </pre>
