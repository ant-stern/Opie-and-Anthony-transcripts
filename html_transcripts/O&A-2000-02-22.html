<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of the "Psycho Mark" incident outside the David Letterman studio.  This involved a physical altercation between Psycho Mark and news crews, resulting in a "cluster F" of tackling and a reporter being unintentionally injured.  The hosts discussed their damage control efforts with their boss, Jeremy, and encouraged listeners to continue creating disruptive signs for live TV, albeit more creatively. A listener whose father worked for NBC News confirmed Psycho Mark's notoriety and the networks' attempts to stop him. The hosts then shifted to discussing David Letterman's post-heart surgery return to his show, playing clips of an emotional Letterman and a rambling Robin Williams.  Speculation followed on the Grammys, including Carlos Santana's revelation of childhood molestation and Britney Spears's upcoming performance.  They also discussed various musical acts, Carson Daly's awkward encounter with NSYNC, and a scheduling conflict preventing Adam Ferrara from appearing on Letterman.  A call with Adam Ferrara himself, however, did take place, though he remained evasive about his New York trip, leading the hosts to speculate about a multi-level marketing scheme.

The show continued with one of the hosts detailing a heart condition ("blockage") using graphic humor.  The hosts then discussed the deteriorating health of Bob Hope and the impending deaths of other celebrities. This was unexpectedly interrupted by the arrival of two underage listeners, Nick and Colin, who brought beer to the studio. The hosts interviewed the boys about acquiring the beer and their fake IDs in Times Square before confiscating the alcohol. A caller, Chris, further detailed the ease of creating fake IDs. The conversation then moved to upcoming changes at WNEW, including the departure of Mason and Kalinsky, and speculation on replacements. A call with Paul confirmed some of these rumors.  Opie and Anthony then officially announced their move to the morning show, outlining the new station lineup.

The show further explored the popularity of *The Sims*, focusing on an unofficial website's uncensored nudity patch. Steve from the website and a caller, Nick, discussed the patch's installation.  Jay Moore, a guest leaving for Las Vegas, joined the discussion, sharing a story about Stephen Lynch and a minibar incident.  More discussion ensued regarding Jay Moore's departure and a humorous fan encounter at a Stephen Lynch show.  The hosts then frantically searched for a guitar for Lynch's upcoming appearance.

With Jay Moore and Stephen Lynch now in-studio, the conversation shifted to Lynch's past stage experiences, including a controversial lyric at a Special Olympics event.  A significant portion of this segment consisted of sexually explicit phone calls and discussions, with callers Cindy and Carmen providing graphic advice and anecdotes on oral sex.  The hosts, along with Jay Moore, contributed to the explicit discussion with instructions and jokes.  The "Hummer Tuesday" theme was used as a running joke relating to oral sex, alongside advertisements for Fidelity Diamond. The hosts mocked Vince Scalza and his radio show.  They again announced their upcoming move to the morning drive time slot. Stephen Lynch performed his song "Kill a Kitten," sparking further discussion about its controversial nature. The segment ended with an advertisement for Rockaway Bedding.


The final segment heavily featured the creation and performance of the song "Full-Blown AIDS," written by Mike Dinacola and Jay Moore, with Stephen Lynch providing the musical arrangement.  The segment largely revolved around the hosts' attempts to get Lynch to perform the song, which he initially resisted due to not having written the lyrics. The song itself was highly offensive, containing graphic and vulgar language about AIDS and prostitution.  There was a lengthy discussion about the song's authorship and offensiveness, followed by Lynch's reluctant performance.  Numerous listener calls reacted to the song, ranging from outrage to amusement. The hosts discussed the potential for controversy and a Guinness World Record. Listener calls also touched upon other controversial topics, including a Yankee player's failed drug tests. The show ended with humorous banter between the hosts and Stephen Lynch (the only explicitly named in-studio guest during this segment), referencing various songs, events, and inside jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is debauchery mania.  Prostate exams for everyone.  1-1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  And we're back. Phone line 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Hey, fax line 2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9.  It's the O&A show.  Hey man, we were talking about music while the commercials were playing.  And Grammys are, what, tomorrow? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Oh, we couldn't fly out to L.A. this year and talk to all the musicians like we usually do every year, Anthony?  What's up with that?  We haven't done that in the last couple of years now.  Why don't they send us on any of those things anymore?  Those used to be fun.  And at this point, we're lucky to have a job. Shut up.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, they used to send us to those things.  Now it's best to keep them in the studio, locked behind doors.  And that's dangerous, too. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  As we found out Friday.  Oh, ho, ho.  Yeah.  When is that clip going to be on the unofficial website?  Steve is still hunting for the tape of the wowing on CBS.  I want to see it again.  It is so freaking funny.  Now that I know we're most likely not in trouble.  God, is that one of the funniest things ever from Friday's show?  I was distracted from the news guy getting, like, checked, as you said, because I was watching the melee in the background of Psycho Mark and a couple of listeners with their wow sign. 
[00:01:30]  Well, I was on the phone with our new boss, Jeremy, all weekend long, doing damage control.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he asked me, because he left early Friday, our new boss, Jeremy, who we love.  We really do like this guy.  He's really high on the show, and he's allowing us to be ourselves.  And he left because of the snowstorm Friday, so I had to, like, call him over the weekend and make sure he knew exactly what would happen.  Of course, we're talking about Psycho Mark. 
[00:02:00]  He was outside the Letterman studio Friday with another wow sign.  And there was checking involved.  The reporter got checked.  There was a fight.  There was a melee.  There was a tug-of-war over a wow sign, all live on TV.  It was just a freaking cluster F.  Yeah, the CBS News trailer, where they keep their staff during the live shots and everything, just emptied out.  And a foot chase after Psycho Mark and a couple of his cohorts ended with a little bit of a brawl.  A little?  I didn't know what to look at.  It was in the live shot on TV. 
[00:02:30]  I didn't know what to look at.  So we'll have the clip on the unofficial website, hopefully, in the next day or two.  So I got Jeremy on the phone because he's back in Washington.  And I had to start the story four separate times because I was laughing so freaking hard.  He's like, all right.  I got to see that.  He's like, all right, explain to me what happened.  I'm like, okay, well, you know how Psycho Mark likes to cause havoc with these live shots?  And now he has his psychopaths.  And every time there's a live shot, you know, we encourage the listeners to get a wow sign on TV and stuff. 
[00:03:00]  He goes, yeah, of course, you know.  I'm like, all right, so they're live outside the Letterman's studio.  And all of a sudden, they go to the reporter, Maury, who's like 70.  He's got to be over 70.  Got to be.  He's an older guy.  It's icy.  It's snowy.  It's a miserable night.  And all of a sudden, you see Mark in the background.  And he just kind of lifts up his huge wow sign.  We've seen it many times in the past.  Mark has been kicking ass with that wow sign all over TV.  And I go, and then, Jeremy, well, at that point, you see, like, three guys jump out of some kind of truck and pretty much tackle Mark live on TV. 
[00:03:30]  Classic.  And then I just start freaking laughing.  He goes, what's the problem?  Well, I go, well, that was only part of what happened.  And you see, while they tackled Mark, then two of Mark's psychopaths come running toward the camera with another wow sign.  And they swear, they swear that they slipped on the ice when they checked him.  On his live shot.  On his live shot.  So I'm laughing so hard.  I'm like, so one of the psychopaths, yeah, they kind of slipped and checked Maury. 
[00:04:00]  He almost fell over.  And then the psychopath tried to run away, but his arm or something was caught with the mic cord.  And then he spun Maury around a little bit.  And I'm laughing so freaking hard.  And he's like, calm down, dude.  I need the facts.  I'm like, I'm trying, Jeremy.  I'm trying.  I go, well, at that point, then you look in the back again.  And now they're having a huge tug of war over this wow sign.  Remember, people, the guy is trying to do a live shot here.  Yeah.  We completely disrupted the whole newscast.  Yeah.  And then I go, well, then Maury hears all the commotion in the background. 
[00:04:30]  So he turns completely around.  Now his head is to the back of the camera to see what's going on.  And then he had to tell the cameraman, OK, focus on me.  And then they start the report.  And then Mark runs away.  Oh, my God.  I was laughing so freaking hard at it.  So now we, I guess we're OK for now as far as this episode.  Well, no one has talked to us yet today.  So I think we're going to be all right.  But that was, it was touch and go for a while. 
[00:05:00]  Bless you, Anthony.  Thank you.  I'll pay.  Bless you.  Let's, hey, Glenn.  Yo.  What's going on?  Yeah, my father works for NBC News.  He does courier work, actually.  And they stand there by the cameraman and make sure nobody sticks their fingers up so they  can get the live shots out, you know?  Oh, really?  Let me tell you, Psycho Mark is the buzz.  They either want to kill him or just break his arm.  But I think next time that they get a good close shot on him, I think they're going to  take him out in some physical way.  Well, it's like the most wanted on the most wanted list. 
[00:05:30]  They just want to break his little neck.  Well, that's obvious, because CBS tackled him live on TV Friday.  Yeah, NBC as well.  They're waiting for him.  I mean, it's like they've got an all-points bulletin on his anus.  You know, at this point, though, it's too late.  There's too many psychopaths out there now.  Yeah.  We've got Mark, and then we've spawned a million psychopaths.  Maybe syndication now.  And let me tell you, this isn't just somebody coming behind the camera.  You know, when the reporter's out there and some people just get behind the camera, start  jumping and waving and smiling.  We are talking in front of the reporter attacks. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  That's what this is all about, people.  We've had three or four the last week alone.  It's one thing to do something behind the reporter.  When you cross that barrier, when you cross over, and now you're in front of the reporter,  now you are the prime attention.  You know, we were going to talk about this later, but you know what?  We might as well, you know, continue the discussion right now.  I mean, the wow sign's all good and dandy, and I encourage you to continue getting the  wow sign on live TV.  Yeah.  But other signs that are associated with this radio show would be pretty good, too. 
[00:06:30]  Absolutely.  Like a quick, rusty trombone sign, or a map of Hawaii, anything.  A map of Hawaii.  Get creative with your signs, you know?  I don't think Psycho Mark's going to be allowed out for a while, so he needs his psychopaths  to take over.  Yeah.  His cover's been blown.  You see a live shot anywhere in the tri-state area, get a sign and get yourself on TV.  You've got to be creative, though, because they're watching out for us at this point.  You must have, like, pictures of you, Psycho Mark, up in all the trailers when they 
[00:07:00]  go out to do their live shots.  Look for this man.  If you see him, tackle him.  Good.  I hope they break my neck.  I swear to God, they can go F themselves.  Every one of them.  He's on a mission.  Yeah, he's cocky now, but I got him good over the weekend.  I should have taped that, Ben.  You got it on tape still?  I got it on tape.  I called Ben, right?  Yeah.  Because I don't know Psycho Mark's number, so I go through Ben.  Thank God.  And this was after I talked to Jeremy, our new boss, and he's got all the facts, and he's  pretty much like, I think we're going to be okay, guys, okay? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  So I'm like, all right, I better call Ben and get to Psycho Mark, because I knew when  you left Friday, you were freaking, right?  Yeah.  And he's still freaking.  So I call up Ben, and Ben and Mark were in Boston this weekend.  Yeah.  So I got Ben's answer machine, and I go, oh, Ben, dope, man.  Oh, no.  Psycho Mark's fired, man.  Oh, no.  What did I say?  He's fired.  You said, like, he's fired.  It's over.  It's over.  He's fired, man. 
[00:08:00]  And he repeated it, like, five times.  Oh, my God.  You suck, man.  You suck.  And then there was a pause, and then I go, ah, just get it, man.  Have Psycho Mark call me.  Oh, you suck.  Ben hands me the phone, right?  Sweat is dripping down off my face.  My heart just fell right down to my nuts.  I was like, oh, my God.  That's my life, you know?  That's my life.  That's what being associated with the show is all about.  You never know if the next day you're going to be fired or not.  Yeah.  That's just the way it is.  That's the environment we have here on this show. 
[00:08:30]  So get aboard, man.  And I have been suspended three or four times in the past, fired once.  There are so many times we leave the show like, hey, take care, man.  Take care.  Yeah.  I don't know if I'll see you again.  Might be it.  And everyone around us, they're the ones sweating because they haven't been through it yet.  But if you don't get the boot, it's damn good radio.  And it's fine.  He said fired me three times.  See?  You fit the profile to be part of this show.  But I got him so bad over the weekend.  Oh, man.  It's not looking good.  He's fired.  I think he's done. 
[00:09:00]  He's fired.  He's done.  I just talked to Jeremy.  You're fired.  You are.  Jetson.  Go try working over at Codswell Cogs because you're fired.  Hey, Don, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Great.  How could they possibly fire a guy who's been crowned on national television?  Yeah, they have.  You won't miss him out of his business.  So we're over at Fox News there, Fox and Friends.  Hey, Don, what's going on?  What do you do for them? 
[00:09:30]  I'm one of the technical managers there.  Oh, you guys took care of us.  Yeah, well, we like you guys.  You've got a lot of fans over there.  Not only did Fox and Friends allow Psycho Mark to be all over their shots with the wow sign,  they interviewed him.  And put the crown on his head from, what, Miss USA or whatever?  Miss Universe?  That's right.  Yeah, cool.  So it was a good deal.  Anyway, they can't possibly fire him.  He's been crowned.  All right, Don, thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  I must say, Fox and Friends is the only cool station so far.  Everyone else has a problem with Psycho Mark and the Psycho Pass.  I don't understand it. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  It adds a little excitement.  The best is when they put masks on.  God damn, those guys from Friday were hilarious.  Except for the fact that they checked the reporter by accident.  But to see what?  He had a mask on?  Yeah.  And it looked like his face was melting?  I've got to tell you, after you left Friday, we sat in the office for about a half an hour  rewinding that tape and playing it over and over again.  Wait, which one, though?  There's so many.  The one, Channel 11?  Channel 11.  Yeah, the Channel 11 one.  10 o'clock news, yeah.  We played it in slow motion, where you see the guy with the mask and the wow sign coming 
[00:10:30]  up behind him.  First, you see this ominous shadow move behind the guy.  You know he's coming.  Right.  Then you see the guy with the wow sign and the big, like, burnt-up gorilla mask.  I don't know what the hell it is.  Yeah, it looks like his face is melting.  Comes up behind him, and then right next to him, and puts the sign in front of the reporter's  face.  Completely in front of the reporter's face.  The reporter horrified.  You see it in the slow-mo of his face.  It could have been O.J. with a big knife coming at him.  That's how scared this guy looked. 
[00:11:00]  It was hysterical.  Yeah, the shadow, it reminded me of, like, a shark in the water.  Yeah.  Like, you see it kind of under the surface.  What's that?  You see this ominous shadow, and then all of a sudden, there he is, the kook with a wow  sign.  And the horrified reporter.  We were laughing our asses off.  Remember what he was saying when he put the sign in front of the reporter's face?  He mumbles something.  He's like, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy with the mask on the wow sign.  He's like, ooh, wow, wow, or something. 
[00:11:30]  I don't even know what the hell he said.  It was the funniest damn thing.  Mark and the psychopaths have pretty much taken over live TV at this point.  We have hit every station, I think, now.  We've gotten two.  We've got four.  We've got seven.  We've got Fox.  And then we've got the...  P.I.M.  Yeah, P.I.M.  We've got Channel 11.  They did Channel 13 this summer at the Bruce show.  Right.  Well, we'll see if anyone strikes today.  You never know.  Where are the live shots today?  Now I can't wait to see if anyone strikes today.  I smell Good Morning America on Wednesday. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah?  Really?  All right.  All right.  And what happened with entertainment tonight?  Oh, that's right.  When Regis walked into Dave Letterman's...  Regis, on Friday.  On Friday.  To tape his show.  He's back from his heart surgery.  Get me a heart patient and a heart disease.  He was walking into Letterman's Theater and I had the wild sign, so I stood behind in front  of all the paparazzis, you know, showing the wild sign.  And John the Dump Guy said that he saw me last night when Regis was walking in on Entertainment 
[00:12:30]  today, right?  Meanwhile, I was screaming, you know, hey, Regis, how's Capulee's fun back?  This is fantastic.  I can juggle with them.  They're like two hacky sacks.  Oh, man.  I said that that made it as well, son.  That's classic.  Cool.  Another bonus.  All right.  We'll see if it's getting all over.  We'll see if anyone strikes today.  That would be good.  Continue with the wild signs, but you could get creative with other signs that have to  do with the show. 
[00:13:00]  Ah, yes.  Because then if you're home, I mean, and you're a fan of the show and you see, like, I don't  know, Spaz is an idiot or something, you'll laugh pretty hard.  All right.  And we've got to take a break.  We want to talk about the Grammys and Carlos Santana, what, his uncle was a kid toucher?  I don't know.  Yeah, he came out.  Now, it's his first time getting a Grammy and, I don't know, has he ever been nominated  for a Grammy?  And now I think he's pulling this whole thing where he's trying to get the sympathy vote  by saying somebody touched his little schween.  All right, let's get into the story next. 
[00:13:30]  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Grown men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  107 WNEW.  AnthonyPriceline.com.  Yes, saving people money saved us plenty on hotels and airfare, and now groceries.  How about that?  You know how much it costs to, like, shop for your household?

[00:15:00]  Coal Chamber?  Yeah.  Check this out right here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That makes me want to take crowbars to people's heads.  Oh.  That rocks.  Coal Chamber rocks.  They're coming to town with Typo Negative, Anthony.  Yeah?  March 14th, Roseland.  Typo Negative's a great band to check out, too.  Yeah.  Hey, Finn. 
[00:15:30]  Wow, I love that.  Sorry.  Very loud.  Do you know anything about Foo Fighters, Chili Peppers?  They're playing in Albany.  They're coming around.  New York City area.  They're playing in the arena up in Albany.  They're not even playing in Boston.  That's really weird.  Yeah, it is weird.  Like, I would go to that in a second, but who the hell wants to go to Albany?  Yeah.  Foo Fighters and Peppers.  They'll probably be back in the summer, though.  Foo Fighters were on Letterman last night.  Letterman called the Foo Fighters his favorite band, and he had them play his favorite song. 
[00:16:00]  You like the rock and roll, kids?  In honor of his comeback show last night, they played Everlong.  Oh, yeah?  For Dave.  Did you see that last night, the David Letterman stuff?  No.  No, I missed it.  Oh, man.  Man, that was intense.  Yeah?  I gotta say.  What was it?  First of all, welcome back to Dave Letterman.  Seriously, no jokes here.  Welcome back to you, Dave.  Godspeed.  He looked really thin, though.  Did he?  And he was looking, like, kind of thin anyway.  He looked like a scarecrow in that suit last night.  I was a little worried there.  Yeah.  But it was pretty funny.  He was talking about how, you know, he was away for a while, and he had a quintuple bypass, 
[00:16:30]  and he got a haircut.  He's a pisser.  But most of the show last night was pretty serious.  I mean, he had a lot of funny jokes about the experience, but then he brought out all  the doctors and the nurses and all the people that...  He brought all the people out.  Oh, yeah.  One by one.  Went with his, like, regular physician, then a heart specialist, then he had the surgeons  that, you know, did the operation.  He even had, like, this fat nurse that bathed him after the operation. 
[00:17:00]  Uh-oh.  And it was pretty...  I got to admit, it was pretty intense, because my dad went through that whole thing about  six, seven years ago.  Yeah.  So, in a slight way, I could understand what Dave was going through, because at one point,  you know, he announced them all, and then he choked up.  When was the last time you saw David Letterman choke up?  Never.  He's never serious.  Never.  But he almost cried last night on TV.  Oh, no, not Corky Letterman.  Come on, man.  But there are certain people...  Do we have that clip?  It's getting out of control.  We have that clip.  Get Rick.  What happened to hiding your emotions? 
[00:17:30]  Hold it back until you turn it into a goddamn serial killer.  Man, it's not getting out of control.  He had a quintuple bypass, man.  It turns out that he had, like, he described it as a grenade in his chest.  He could have died at any minute.  A grenade?  That's what they're saying.  I mean, the left artery there?  Yeah.  One of the main ones there?  Yeah.  He calls it the con-ed of the body.  The con-ed?  Yeah, you need that one.  The aorta?  He says that...  The doctor said that it could have pretty much burst at any day. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, that's wonderful.  And the morning before the operation, he ran six miles.  Because he didn't know that he was going to, you know, have this surgery.  So he finally, you know, introduces all the doctors and stuff.  And then he basically said, I want to thank these guys for saving my life.  And he was all choked up.  Hey, Rick, we got the Letterman clip.  Wow.  Corky Dave.  What do you got in the other room?  Corky Letterman. 
[00:18:30]  No.  Where is it?  You ready?  Yeah, hit it.  So it was five weeks ago today that these men and women right here saved my life.  And, uh...  But the deal...  No, no, no.  I don't want to...  But the point, that's not the big deal. 
[00:19:00]  They do it several times a day.  They do it hundreds of times a year.  And when you're going through this, you think to yourself,  I'm never going to be able to get through this.  But you do get through it.  And the reason you get through it is because these people get you through it.  If you ever have to have this surgery, by God, I hope you're blessed enough  to go through it with people like these.  It's your joke!  Really?  I can't get the gig, right?  Why do you need to do it?  Why do you need to do it? 
[00:19:30]  That was pretty much it.  Wow.  It was all choked up.  That's not...  These people hate it.  I don't know why you had to have Robin Williams on last night, though.  Oh, he's like the court jester.  He has to just be funny.  It's like he's there to cheer Dave up and make him forget that he even had the surgery,  I'm sure, by his fantastic comedy.  He was dressed up as a doctor, and he was making no sense.  Oh, look, I'm a doctor.  Oh, stethoscope.  Look.  Hello, hello.  He's in his own little world. 
[00:20:00]  Look how hairy my hands are.  Well, yeah, he made some hairy jokes.  Yeah, look, I'm hairy.  Because Letterman said, you know, they pretty much shaved you completely down there.  They need a weed maker for me.  Yeah, right, right, right.  Basically, that's what he's saying.  Look, I'm a doctor.  Here, here, here.  It took him two days.  One more clip?  No, no, no, no.  Is this the clip of Robin Williams?  Yep.  Ladies and gentlemen, Robin Williams.  Oh, yeah.  The incomparable is so funny.  Before we begin the penal reduction. 
[00:20:30]  All right, Dave, everything you okay?  We just bought this in case something happened.  Huh?  Things are okay?  People at CBS are tracking you.  It's still beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  What?  I got some stuff here.  Hold on, let's see what we brought for you.  A little goodie bag.  Hold on one second.  Got to open this thing.  Hey, wouldn't this be great in an emergency?  I can't help you.  Wait, Michael Jackson, the old nose.  Yeah, oh, wait.  Oh, we got another thing in here.  Oh, some sperm from David Crosby. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, wait.  Okay, let's put that down for a little.  Wait.  And one of Shear's ribs.  Whatever you want to do.  Thank you very much for coming in.  It means a lot to me that you would do this.  It's just nice to have you back.  Thanks, Dad.  That'll wear off.  I know.  I don't see this at the surgery.  Hey, Dave, it's me.  They just started being real funny. 
[00:21:30]  Hold on.  I'm over here with the anesthesiologist.  Give me that.  Boy, that guy.  That was amazing.  You had all those doctors up here.  Not a single beeper went off.  It is.  I got to go.  I got to make the tea.  I got to make the tea.  And Arsenio's sitting at home going, damn.  He's back.  I asked you, Lord.  I asked you.  Oh, not the preacher thing.  I have a doctor who's a combination of proctologist and urologist. 
[00:22:00]  And it's a little scary because he says, turn your head and fart, which is sick.  You know.  For those of you playing the home game.  I mean, I haven't had any.  Closed captioning.  Now.  Closed captioning.  In May, I'm having.  Save me back.  Save me back.  So they just said, what did you get?  A Quinella?  No.  I got a.  You had an Angie Dixon. 
[00:22:30]  Angie Dixon.  I said, why did we do five bypasses?  And he said, hey, let's just throw an extra one in.  We're running a special.  Hey, come on.  But they shave you up like a lab monkey.  Oh, they go.  Oh, yeah.  It would be two days with me.  I see the eight guys working around the block.  I'm sorry, Mr. Williams.  We're going to have to take a lunch break.  The surgeon, the guy's got a fart on me.  I didn't mean to make it. 
[00:23:00]  I told you, he's taking these off too.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  There you have it, Pete.  The very unfunny Robin Williams.  Kind of wrecked the show yesterday.  God.  I enjoyed the rest of the Letterman show last night, but Robin Williams. 
[00:23:30]  And the whole crowd is laughing.  They think everything he says is funny.  Well, he comes running out, and he's so full of energy and so manic.  It's amazing.  And people just think anything out of his mouth is funny, so they'll laugh.  What was that?  What did you have?  Hey, what?  What?  What did he say?  Oh, I better laugh.  Everyone around me is laughing.  Woo, Robin.  This guy's a genius.  Remember Young Comedians special in 1978? 
[00:24:00]  God, he had me rolling.  What do you do after that?  My stethoscope.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Shazback.  Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  Look, I'm a penis doctor.  And then, like, he won't do it with, like, I don't even know what that means.  It was stupid.  Michael Jackson and Cher jokes.  How dated does he sound?  He had a little cooler.  You know, the coolers they use to, like, transport hearts and stuff.  Uh-huh.  He was making believe there were body parts in there, and he thought that would be funny.  Yeah, but it's funny.  Like, Michael Jackson and Cher jokes. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, those are a little dated.  It's like, you know, hey, how about that Madonna?  Rah.  Hey, huh?  Hey, look at this here.  It's Barbie Benton.  Rah.  I got to tell you, boy, I love that Barbie Benton.  Hey, how about that Brooke Seals?  You know, it's like Michael Jackson.  He's done.  Why couldn't Letterman's heart be okay and Robin Williams have the heart problem?  Oh, look.  Look, I'm dying.  No, no.  Shazback. 
[00:25:00]  I'm taking my own temperature.  The old-fashioned way.  Now I'm going to grow a beard and be serious.  Yeah.  And he gets an acting job.  I'm buying it, Robin.  You grow the beard when you have a serious role.  Serious role.  We'll grow the beard.  Figure it out for yourself at home, kids.  Awakenings?  Beard.  Beard.  All right.  What was the one with...  Mrs. Doubtfire?  Mrs. Doubtfire.  No beard.  No beard. 
[00:25:30]  Good Will Hunting?  Beard.  Beard.  Mork and Mindy, of course.  No beard.  Hatch Adams?  No beard.  Hatch Adams?  No beard.  Paul from Inwood, he's writing on the Instant Feedback.  I think Dave banged the fat Puerto Rican nurse.  He was really, really nice to that lady.  Yeah?  Well, because she had to, like, you know, bathe him after the operation.  You think Leno was bummed in just a little way?  If it wasn't for that hot doctor, I would have been number one for sure. 
[00:26:00]  You know?  I mean, you've got to think there's something in him going, Hatch, he would have died, you know.  No, it wouldn't have been a fight anymore.  You know, I've got to say something.  You know, when we go after Howard, we're called, you know, we're not team players and stuff.  You don't know the crap we take.  It's amazing.  If we mention Howard too much on this show, we catch crap from the upper echelon of the CBS Corporation. 
[00:26:30]  Because Howard goes right to the big boss and talks about us.  And cries.  That's a fact.  And then we get in trouble and, like, things are taken away from us and our syndication deal is put on hold and stuff because we're told we're not team players.  And I don't care.  All the Howard, like, you know, we listen to Howard.  We've talked about this in the past.  That's great and everything.  And if you're one of those hardcore fans that just want to bash, fine.  Feel free.  Who cares?  But this is fact.  This isn't some made-up thing in our own head. 
[00:27:00]  This has happened.  We talk about him.  We get crap because they call us up.  Usually when we talk about him, it's because we're defending ourselves because, you know, he makes fun of us and stuff.  So we fight back and then we get in trouble with the company, right?  Because we're not team players.  Not team players.  That's the key phrase.  David Letterman's biggest night of his career last night.  And Howard goes on Leno.  But we're called, you know, not team players.  And starts bashing him.  And bashes Letterman. 
[00:27:30]  CBS is a big late-night franchise, The Late Show.  And Howard's on NBC bashing.  And we're called not team players.  But we catch hell if we do one.  Boo-hoo-hoo.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  That's right, Robin.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I see they didn't fix the phones.  Yeah, what's up, Jay?  Oh, what's going on?  That Letterman show last night, you know, usually that trivia, you know, when people come back and stuff, it's pretty gay. 
[00:28:00]  But that was awesome.  I think this is definitely going to be the turning point when he steals back the ratings from Leno.  You know what?  I'm going to be watching every day this week.  Definitely.  And he's got the fill-in host on Tuesday and Thursday.  Well, they got Cosby hosting tonight.  Yeah, that should be a disaster.  That would be fun to tune in to.  No, my pal Adam is supposed to be on tonight.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  We just found out Adam Farrar, Anthony's childhood friend, good friend of the radio show here, is going to be on Letterman tonight with Cosby as the guest host. 
[00:28:30]  Some good friend, the bastard doesn't even call, say he's going to be on because he doesn't want us to jinx it.  Oh, is that it?  He does know us too well.  But I guess Adam Farrar is going to be on Letterman tonight.  Yeah.  When you see Leno last night, though, it was the return of Corky Stern.  I know you don't want to talk about him or anything.  Nah, whatever.  I thought Howard's appearance on Leno was pretty boring.  Yeah, he's done much better in the past.  Yeah, what happened to the old, you know, Howard would go on the shows and it would just take over and it was kind of cool and stuff and funny. 
[00:29:00]  And this one was like Hollywood Howie pitching his new TV shows.  Yeah.  How happened to that guy?  But watch Letterman tonight, Adam Farrar.  And then Thursday, the guest host is, oh, God, Kathie Lee.  Oh, no.  Kathie Lee Gifford.  Oh, no.  Is guest hosting Thursday.  That's going to be a disaster.  But I thought Dave was all bitter.  What happened?  Why do we have to sit through Kathie Lee?  Dave's going to be back tomorrow night, though.  Yeah.  With Julia Roberts. 
[00:29:30]  So what is he, just stop in once a week?  He's going to do either two or three nights a week.  But they're not really sure.  That's pretty cool.  He might do Friday show as well.  I like the guest host thing.  Like they used to do with Carson years ago.  Remember that?  But they've got to have good guest hosts.  I mean, they can't get Jon Stewart.  I think Comedy Central will understand if Dave needs Jon Stewart to fill in one night.  They would absolutely not let Jon Stewart do that.  Well, instead they get Kathie Lee Gifford instead of Jon.  Jon Stewart's been doing very well for Comedy Central.  You think they're going to let him even get a taste of network TV? 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  You put Jon Stewart on there.  They've got to keep him down.  You put Seinfeld on there.  Keep him like a beaten dog.  Not Kathie Lee Gifford.  Yeah.  She promises a great show Thursday.  Yeah.  She promises something that has never been seen on network TV.  She's going to show her gash.  Now that would be something to tune into.  See where?  Cody came sliding out of that goddamn wet and wild is what that thing is, I bet, at this point. 
[00:30:30]  Giff's old prune making the rounds on that thing every week or so.  Oh.  Opens up like a slip and slide.  Speaking of Cody, I've got to admit, I watch Regis and Kathie Lee every morning so I can yell at the TV.  Of course!  No, I yell at the TV.  I can't take this whore!  And Sandy takes the remote and changes the station because I just yell.  Because I hate Kathie Lee.  You see, Regis gets so pissed.  I know everyone hates her and it's so, you know, it's so weird to hate her, but I truly hate her.  Well, there is a reason why everyone hates her.  And Regis will sit there. 
[00:31:00]  He'll tell a story about, you know, how I was at Notre Dame this weekend.  It was fabulous.  I got pictures.  You know, and he'll go through a story and stuff and it's mildly entertaining.  And then Kathie Lee comes on and starts talking about her kids.  Regis, you see him.  He goes right for his coffee cup.  It's like a crutch.  And he looks away.  He looks away, grabs his coffee cup, and you just know he's thinking, oh, this twat!  I'm on one of the most successful TV shows in history!  Who wants to be a millionaire? 
[00:31:30]  And I still got to deal with this twat!  Gelman, get me a new twat!  I've had it!  I can't take it anymore!  It ain't babbling about those two retards!  Those two Mongoloid children!  And that old bad husband of hers!  There's going to be some good TV watching on Friday, though, because Cody's going to be a reason that Kathie Lee is playing the piano.  Oh, my God. 
[00:32:00]  Is she out of her mind?  They haven't had Cody on since he dressed up like a patriot and sung.  Is he like, what is he now, 22?  Is he 22 or 23?  Did you see the show when he came out to sing and he forgot the words and he was dressed up like a little gay patriot?  Oh, my God.  He's coming back Friday.  That is some great viewing when he comes on that show.  She's beaming, and Regis just rags him the whole time.  He couldn't remember the words!  He's a little Mongoloid!  Look at him! 
[00:32:30]  He's a Todd!  And you know, Frank is wishing there was some testosterone in his son.  Oh, my God, I know.  Frank, the big football hero, is praying that his son's going to be a football player.  Well, with the coddling that he gets from Kathie Lee, he's destined to be a homo.  I was going to say, you know, if he does play football, the only position he's going to play is wide receiver.  Kathie Lee!  Look, you've got yourself a little Potterpuff!  He's a marshmallow, a rope swallower, a faggler, a butt pirate! 
[00:33:00]  Look at him!  Let's go to Mike.  Mike!  Hey, how you doing?  You guys are going to hear this all afternoon long, when the phones suck.  Someone around here will get the hint and then tweak the phones and make them work again.  Mike!  Wake up!  You are!  I was watching Good Morning America this morning, right?  Yeah.  And Kathie Lee's sitting there, she's like, oh, my button popped.  Then she buttons up her pants, she's like, oh, there it goes again.  Oh, yeah.  Expecting the penis to pop out or something. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, the button on her pants was, uh, kept unbuttoning.  Yeah.  It's probably because of that huge Montana crotch rat in her pants.  Can't hold back that, that Jiffy Pop popcorn thing.  Look at that travel!  Oh, gal, man.  Got growing in her panties.  Hold up like a sleeping bag, and I guess the tie broke or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, she probably doesn't keep it, uh, well-groomed down there.  All right, Joe Lyons from Comedy Central.  Hey.  Joey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Why isn't Jon Stewart, uh, guest hosting Letterman? 
[00:34:00]  I don't know, I guess I would have to ask him.  The guy's brilliant.  We would let him, of course we would.  I think you guys would let him.  That's great PR, man.  I don't know.  You guys keep him down like a dog.  Not at all.  You know something?  He had a taste of, uh, regular network television.  He, uh, did very well.  I thought he was hysterically funny, but the show got canceled.  So you guys used that to your advantage to get him to do this show under the safety  of cable television, where ratings are secondary.  And then he, he's doing very well now, and I think he could successfully make the jump 
[00:34:30]  to late night, uh, network television.  I don't disagree with you.  You keep him on a tight leash, don't you?  He had a deal with Worldwide Pants for over a year.  Really?  Yeah, he had a development deal.  Yeah, he was there for a while.  He had a development deal with Letterman's Peeps.  So, hey, uh, what were you going to say, Joey?  Oh, on, on the CBS site, on the CBS Late Show site, it says that it's Dane Cook, not Adam.  Really?  In the paper today, it says...  It says Bill Cosby with Heidi Klum, Vince Carter, some Dr. Mahone, and Dane Cook.  How come in the newspaper it says Adam? 
[00:35:00]  I have no idea.  Dane, Dane Cook...  I'm just, I'm just pointing out the difference.  Dane's funny, but I don't know.  Dane Cook is really funny.  We had Dane on our show.  Yeah, he's not my pal.  But in the paper, it's saying Adam Farrar, so it's...  Yeah, I know, and I was looking at an online site, too.  They might have changed at the last minute or something.  But, all right, call Adam.  Get him on the phone.  Thank you, Joe.  Before he was even booked.  He's bumped out of the paper.  Poor bastard.  We've got to get to the bottom of that.  Yeah.  We have Adam's phone, uh, home number, right?  Yeah.  Let's give him a call.  I think we could call him up. 
[00:35:30]  All right, and we've got to take another break.  Yeah.  If you want in on the radio show, I'm just looking at the phones.  Nothing to really go to right now.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  We'll regroup, and we'll be back.  Stay there.  All right, here he comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie's worse than Hitler.  We're up to a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhuman Show.  1027-WNEW.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:36:00]  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't fix him.  There's such a problem.  Hey, stop.  1027-WNEW.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Korn playing April 1st at the Continental Arena.  April 8th, that's Nassau Coliseum.  If you've never seen Korn, you've got to check them out.  Unbelievable live show.  I've been jamming the Issue CD.  Yeah.  In my CD Walkman on the train. 
[00:36:30]  I've been playing a lot of the Kid Rock.  That one.  Devil without a cause, I'm going platinum.  You like the Kid Rock, yeah?  Yeah.  I really like that Kid Rock album.  I like it.  I don't think he's got much longevity in the biz, let's say.  But I like the sound of the album.  Why would you say that?  I don't know.  It's the type of product I don't think you could consistently pump out album after album of. 
[00:37:00]  You know?  Well, that's the curse of being in today's music.  Yeah.  You're only good for a couple CDs and you're done.  Yeah, there's no like Zeppelins or The Who's or anything like that.  Where every year you're pumping out an album that sells as good as the last.  Well, Korn's showing a little longevity right now.  A little bit.  We'll have to wait and see what they pump out next.  You know, the Peppers.  The Peppers.  Foo Fighters.  Foo Fighters.  Foo Fighters.  Big time proving themselves.  I thought that was going to be a one disc and they're out of here. 
[00:37:30]  What?  Nirvana's drummer?  What?  Yeah.  And now look.  Yeah.  He's more popular than he ever was.  Big man on campus, yeah.  And Foo Fighters getting to that point where they're more popular than Nirvana ever was.  Yeah.  Getting there, I said.  I know that's a debate we could argue for the next two hours, but I'm down.  I'm down.  Okay, Mr. Push-Ups.  But, yeah, the Kid Rock thing, like I said, love the album, but I don't think, I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That stuff, it could get old real fast. 
[00:38:00]  You know what I mean?  Speaking of albums, Michael Hutchins' solo album comes out today.  Oh, really?  I hate.  How's he doing?  I hate listening to dead guys.  Isn't that sad?  It really bothers me.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm a huge Nirvana fan.  I have a tough time listening to Kurt.  Yeah.  I have a tough time.  I still do it.  I mean, you can listen to the Hendrix and, you know, like the old school, as they like  to say.  But, I don't know.  Like Michael Hutchins.  I mean, his body's barely cold and he's got a new album out today, a solo album. 
[00:38:30]  Dude, you know what's worse, though, than listening to old Nirvana, is when you tune in SNL  and Nirvana was on, you watch Saturday Night Live and see, like, Kurt singing and stuff,  that's hard to watch.  That's kind of creepy and stuff.  It's like, ah, you ass.  It's a bummer.  You blew it.  I wonder what Nirvana would have been if Kurt would have survived.  Man, well, speculate forever.  I'm sure Dave Grohl doesn't care.  Your buddy Kid Rock's going to perform on the Grammys tomorrow. 
[00:39:00]  My buddy.  He's not my buddy.  We like the Kid Rock, right?  Yeah.  And Carlos Santana, Anthony.  Carlos Santana.  We wanted to get to that story.  What, his uncle was a kid toucher when he was growing up?  I don't know if it was his uncle.  Well, what does it say?  I just said that.  He just said he was a molester.  Of course, the song that's up for a Grammy, a few Grammys.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Sweet.  I'm CBS FM.  Yeah.  I could give you a little echo if you want to do that.  It's too late now.  Past the post.  All right.  But, um, yeah, so he's coming.  I don't know why he picked now to come out and say that he was molested as a child, but  he said he had counseling and he's free from guilt and shame.  And he's up for, uh, ten Grammys.  Ten Grammys. 
[00:40:00]  And he's coming out with this now.  I think.  It just seems the timing's a little odd.  Now, what's the story?  Why didn't he come out, like, on the stage of Woodstock and say this?  You know?  What's the story, though?  Someone touched his pee-pee or what?  Uh, it just says he was molested.  As a child.  Yeah.  For a couple of years when he was a kid and, uh, it makes him feel uncomfortable and,  but he's, he's over it.  It doesn't say who, what, where, when, or anything.  Yeah.  Someone, uh, had instant feedback when we talked about it earlier, uh, says, is he Cuban? 
[00:40:30]  Because that's just part of their culture.  And, uh, no.  I don't think so.  It took him 35 years to get nominated, Anthony.  Yeah.  He's going to sweep the Grammys tomorrow.  You watch.  You think so?  He is the favorite.  Everyone says that he's going to take it all.  He's going to win everything tomorrow.  Him, the song.  He didn't write that song, though, you know.  Uh, did Rob Thomas write it?  He's part writer in that, yes.  Yeah.  With another guy.  And then it's, I love when the Grammys come around because you, you realize what phony some 
[00:41:00]  of these people are.  Like, uh, what the hell, Ricky Martin.  Living La Vida Loca.  Uh-huh.  He's not on that.  He didn't write that song.  And you realize when the Grammys are around because, okay, best song.  Living La Vida Loca.  Written by, uh, it's like, what?  That's not Ricky Martin.  He didn't write the goddamn thing.  Uh, yeah.  That's up for record of the year.  There's a couple of them like that.  Album of the year.  It is just pathetic what music has become today. 
[00:41:30]  Album of the year.  Backstreet Boys.  Ugh.  Dixie Chicks.  The Chixie Dicks.  Diana Kroll.  Don't even know who she is.  I have no clue.  Santana and then TLC.  Britney Spears is up for one.  Isn't she, Britney?  Did you see her little Sunday layout in the, uh, in the Sunday Daily News, uh, TV section,  I think it was?  Or one of those, like the magazine section that they have in the Daily News?  I missed that.  Special bonus poster.  Yeah, special boner poster, maybe. 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  She's got those big cans of hers out.  Her lips are just like, it looks like, I swear to God, it looks like she had just been with a guy.  She's got her lips.  Hummer lips.  She has, they're all engorged and just glazed over with some product.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  She's got, of course, the belly showing.  I love Hummer lips.  God.  Is that the biggest turn on, the big, full Hummer lips?  And then she's telling, you know, she's 18 now, Opie.  I know.  Just had her birthday.  She's totally legal now.  We could get her in Playboy, officially. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, things that she collects.  You want to feel old?  What?  She was born.  1982.  1982.  Oh, my God.  You feel old?  It's only three years before my girlfriend.  That's nuts.  Yeah, she says, she says in that article, she, uh, collects diamonds.  Well, there's something any 18-year-old can relate to.  Right.  She's collecting diamonds.  Fantastic, Brittany. 
[00:43:00]  And then she also says she, uh, she will never pose in Playboy.  Someone asked her now that she's legal age.  Let me tell you something about Britney Spears and Playboy.  If that next album comes out and it tanks, she'll be naked in Playboy.  Absolutely.  Guaranteed.  She'll be hoping for Playboy.  I'm praying that the next album tanks so we get her in Playboy while she's still nice and tight.  Yeah.  Because she'll be in Playboy eventually.  I hate when they do that.  Yeah, they're 18, 19 years old, don't want to do Playboy.  All of a sudden, their career is gone. 
[00:43:30]  They're in their 30s and they decide now they're going to strip?  Yeah.  Take it back.  I hope her album tanks so bad, Playboy passes her right by and she's got to go right to swank.  I want to see her in swank.  I want beef curtains.  Yeah, let me give you a swank.  I'm going to give you a swank pose.  Not the swank pose.  Ah!  I hate when you do that, man.  Leg up on the console.  Ugh.  The swank pose.  The swank pose.  Right to swank.  Right to the let's see what Britney had for lunch pose. 
[00:44:00]  Can't wait to see her on the Grammys tomorrow, though.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Is she performing?  I would think so.  That's probably a big attention getter.  I would assume so, sure.  Well, actually, Ben gave me the list of performers at the Grammys here.  Let's run through them, Opie.  Oh, wait.  Where's the performers list, Ben?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Britney's got to perform, right?  She is.  She is performing?  With her little headset mic on.  All right.  So she can massage her cans while she's singing. 
[00:44:30]  Rubs her belly and stuff.  Yeah.  God, every time I had that remote control and I passed by the Nickelodeon channel, got  to stop.  Yeah.  They show the Britney Spears concert like four times a day.  That was the one with her nips popping out.  No, this is the other.  Oh, it wasn't?  No, she still has the belly shirt and stuff.  I thought it was from the Nickelodeon, that award show where she went on and she's performing  in front of a bunch of 10-year-olds and her nips look like pencil erasers. 
[00:45:00]  Like two thumbs.  That's classic.  Billy Barty's fingers.  Yeah, Britney Spears will be performing tomorrow, man.  Oh, cool.  I'm trying to see.  God.  What about the Backstreet Boys or NSYNC?  Of course they're performing.  The only one I want to see tomorrow, there's only three people I want to see perform tomorrow.  Backstreet, no, just kidding.  Sting, Santana.  What's Sting going to be doing?  Kid Rock and Britney Spears performing. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, they don't tell you what?  Well, Sting's latest album is doing really, really well, so yeah, he'll probably perform  one from there.  Has Puffy copped any lines off of his new music yet to change it to millions of dollars for  Puffy?  Give him a couple more months and he'll have something going on with that, I'm sure.  Ben from Jersey, I saw the poster for about two seconds before I put a map of Velasco on  it, talking about the Britney Spears in the Sunday paper, so that thing rocked.  Very good.  Keep the instant feedback going.  We finally figured out a system where we could read all the instant feedbacks. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  It got a little crazier since we've gone all talk, you know?  Yeah.  So, speaking of Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, kudos to Carson Daly this weekend on MTV.  He was right, yeah, and believe me, I don't give him kudos very often.  He was doing this lame-ass win-a-date with NSYNC and he had to deal with these little teeny  boppers who'd come running out on stage and answer questions and tell why they want to go  on a date with all five NSYNC band members.  For what, a gangbang? 
[00:46:30]  An NSYNC gangbang?  Ow!  I thought this was going to be fun!  It hurts!  It hurts!  So, Carson, inadvertently...  I thought we were going out for ice cream or a little rollercoaster.  I thought we were going to play air hockey and get a float!  I thought we were going bowling!  Oh, you seem like such nice boys in the magazines!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I'm bleeding!  Oh, my Lord! 
[00:47:00]  Why?  You don't know from where.  You don't know if I'm going to play air hockey or anything like that, but Carson calls them  NSYNC.  NSYNC?  NSYNC, right on stage in front of them.  And the whole crowd's like, boop, boop, a bunch of little teeny boppers.  And he's like, what?  It was a slip.  I made a mistake.  And then NSYNC starts giving him, starts razzing him back, calling him NSYNC.  He's like, ah, you be quiet.  You want your next song to be on Total Request Live, just shut up. 
[00:47:30]  You can tell he just did not want to be there and deal with that.  Like, he's buddies with Kid Rock and stuff.  And then Kid Rock calls up and goes, ooh, how was NSYNC?  Were they fun to hang with?  Or like totally razzing his ass?  You fag.  Did you get one?  I want to stay with NSYNC.  NSYNC?  Oh, this is great!  I thought we were going out for ice cream!  Why are you playing cards in my bag?  Ow!  Why are you grabbing at my little knobs?  The doctor never put anything in there!  Oh! 
[00:48:00]  Yeah!  I'm so wrong.  I look like I could play as Donut!  That's a stupid contest, though.  It really is.  They all come running out on the stage.  I was hypnotized by it.  Like, I turned it on.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  They go, okay, and now from Buena Park, California, it's candy!  And she comes running out.  Just screaming and jumping.  Her pigtails are flying.  I would be, I love a dick, and I would go to a dick.  I don't, what the, what, what do you think is going to happen?  And they all proposed to me. 
[00:48:30]  We're all living together in a big house.  The five of them just me.  It's great.  They don't have sex with me, but I got the money, and I got all the pictures, and it's retarded.  And I go, yeah, yeah.  Adam Farrar, not on Letterman.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello.  Adam Farrar, everyone.  Hey, Adam.  Hi, you guys.  Hey, pal.  What's happening, champ?  I don't know.  Where are you?  I'm in L.A.  All right, then it must be a misprint.  Unless you're on Leno. 
[00:49:00]  They actually called me to do it, but I have to go test for something, so I couldn't do it.  What are you testing for?  Hospitaliano?  The sequel to the Olive Garden commercial for all the unsolved questions?  I cannot wait until I get another job so we can move the ball breaking up to a new level.  What are you testing for, pal?  I'm not telling you.  I don't want to jinx nothing.  Yeah, that's a good thing on this show.  Don't tell us crap.  How are you doing?  I am doing good, my friend.  How are you?  Very well. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah?  Having fun.  Doing well, Adam?  Yeah, you made the paper today, man.  It says that you're going to be on.  I know.  Well, they called me, and I would love to do it, but I've got to go do this other thing,  so they're going to reschedule me.  The word on the street is March.  Wouldn't have been with Dave, anyway.  It would have been with the Couser.  With the Couser.  The Couser's doing the standing for Dave's heart is a little flatter.  I understand you had some blockage.  Too much jello pudding.  And the blockage.  My wife, Camille, told me about blockage. 
[00:50:00]  We had to clean out the blockage.  What you don't want, Dave, is blockage.  It's like his heart was trying to pump jello pudding through the veins.  That's what it was.  I told Albert, you're too fat.  You're going to get some blockage.  Yeah, a very special fat Albert.  Fat Albert gets a quadruple bypass.  On a very special class.  With the doctor. 
[00:50:30]  Albert, I've told you I've eaten the pork arise.  Look at your cholesterol.  Your cholesterol is like a char with mayonnaise.  We can make a new heart out of this radiator.  And a bicycle pump.  Bounce the bell.  Bounce the bell.  Bounce the bell.  Hey, hey, hey.  It's handioplasty. 
[00:51:00]  Handioplasty.  This ain't no place for you.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  They're going to take my arteries away.  Hey, hey, hey.  All right.  And I'm going to sing a song for you.  A little ventricular tachycardia.  Albert, you've got junk in your able order.  Get the jaws of life. 
[00:51:30]  We've got to crack his chest.  They got to crank open my ribs.  Who said ribs?  How much more ribs?  All right, you're best.  If you're not on, huh?  No, I'm not.  I'm actually, what are you doing the weekend?  This weekend?  Yeah.  You're going to be in New York?  I've got to come in late Thursday, so I'll be around.  Where are you playing?  I'm not playing.  I've got to go in for this other thing. 
[00:52:00]  What other?  The thing I can't tell you.  Italians don't like to give away information.  Oh, it's one of these things you're testing for.  Sure.  Sure.  LA, New York test ad.  It's not a water filtration system sales pitch, is it?  No, it's not.  But let me ask you something.  Did you know cleaning products are a very lucrative issue?  I'm coming in for an Amway meeting.  I've got to come in, and I want to talk to you.  Someone's going to show me the program.  Now, people don't plan to fail.  They fail to plan. 
[00:52:30]  You dick.  Let me tell you something.  Banks crash all the time.  People will always need water.  They always got to eat.  I got to drink, and I got to clean.  Ah, you ass.  Hey, guys.  The financial system falls.  It's Germany before Hitler, and nobody wants that.  Well, if you're going to be in New York, we'll hook up for something.  Yeah, I want to get a hold of you, and I got to talk to you off the air.  I want to hear what this is so I can blab it out over the air.  I know you.  Nah.  All right, pal.  Hold on. 
[00:53:00]  What it's like talking to you and telling you to keep it secret?  What?  Remember the Blazing Saddles when the old woman came to deliver the pie?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's a good case not to speak about this to others.  That's so true.  All right, Adam.  Hold on the line, all right?  All right, pal.  Adam Farrar, everyone.  Oh, yeah.  Live from L.A.  He will not be on Letterman tonight.  No.  A little misprint in the paper.  He had to back it out of that.  He would have been funny.  Yes, he would have been.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  I've been away for a while. 
[00:53:30]  While I was gone, I had quintuple bypass surgery on my heart.  Plus, I got a haircut. 
[00:54:00]  Letterman from last night, of course.  I still think they should have sent out, like, a 90-year-old man in a wheelchair just  to roll out.  Now, David Letterman and just have him, like, ee, ee, ee, ee.  They should have got Bob Hope.  He's not doing anything.  Have Bob Hope in a wheelchair?  He looks so bad.  He's on all the tablets now.  They're saying that it's just a matter of days before Bob Hope joins every friend he's  ever had.  They've been saying that for years with Bob Hope. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, but you know something?  When they end up in the Enquirer and stuff...  The Enquirer is always right.  He's usually right.  You think they just write a bunch of BS stories, but they're always right when it comes to celebrities  dying.  Remember Dean Martin?  They had the picture of him when he was crapping himself and everything, and said it would  be, like, a matter of days.  What happened?  Like, a week later, boom.  Dead.  Done.  Well, Jimmy Stewart.  There's another one.  Goodbye, everybody.  Goodbye, Emporium.  Goodbye, savings and loan. 
[00:55:00]  And there he was.  Dead.  Dead.  Without his wig on.  They showed him the last shot they had of him, coming out of his house after he fell  in the bathtub.  That's what happens to all the old people.  With the big, huge liver spots on his head.  Yeah.  The big liver spots on his head.  I swear it was that ass-head alien from Star Trek head.  It was that size, full of liver spots.  That's not how you want to remember Jimmy Stewart, though.  No, you know?  I want to remember him.  It's a wonderful life.  And Charles Lindbergh's story.  Which way?  I don't know. 
[00:55:30]  Hey!  I didn't know you could do Jimmy Stewart.  I didn't know.  That's classic.  And then, uh...  Who else died like that?  George Burns.  Can you stutter like Jimmy Stewart?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't know.  George Burns.  Yeah.  Same thing.  He slipped in the bathtub.  They all slipped.  Old people, don't bathe.  We don't care if you stink.  The second they hop in a bathtub, it's the end for them.  Their hips crack like graham crackers. 
[00:56:00]  It's horrible.  So you're seeing Bob Hope very soon, huh?  Yeah, I would think so.  Well, he looks like Mr. Freeze right now, so...  My eyes have got chapmeet contact lenses.  His eyes are so red.  Yeah.  He's got, like, rat eyes now.  It's not even a joke.  Hey, it's Bob.  I'm a rat hole.  For Texaco.  How do your eyes get that red?  Like his eyelids are, like, turned inside out or something.  I look like someone pumped Texaco gasoline in my eyes.  Grr.  I can't tell Chiro from Butch Hill. 
[00:56:30]  By the way, we are live today.  I think people think we're still on a long weekend.  Is that what it is?  It's Tuesday.  Yeah.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Fax line 212-957-9639.  You know, every day, Anthony, it's gotten to the point with our radio show that people  just kind of show up.  Yeah.  To say hi.  Yeah.  And they try to get into the studio, Ant.  Yeah, they do.  Well, Rick's upstairs with a couple guys. 
[00:57:00]  I don't think we can let these guys in.  Why?  We'll explain in a minute.  Hey, Rick.  Guys.  What's going on?  What's happening?  All right.  Rick's upstairs.  I'm upstairs with the two guys that just kind of strolled up.  I guess our high school kid's on vacation this week or something.  Yeah.  It's winter break.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  That explains Nick and Colin showing up.  All right.  One's from New York.  One's from New Jersey.  I guess they're buddies or whatever.  And they brought us some gifts.  Gifts.  What kind of gifts?  Can I say what kind of gifts?  You know what kind of gifts.  A beer?  Several. 
[00:57:30]  Pot?  And how old are these kids?  They're beneath the legal age.  Oh, great.  Who sold them beer?  Jeez, man.  Put them on the phone.  I want to see.  I've kept them behind the glass for right now until I got clearance from you guys to let  them in.  Come here, guys.  Let's just talk to them on the phone.  I want to see how a 17-year-old kid gets beer these days.  Who bought the beer?  Because we used to have to hang outside like 7-Eleven and hope one of those cooler, older  kids, because the drinking age was 18 back then, would get us the beer. 
[00:58:00]  Was it you or him?  Okay.  Colin, come here.  Here's Colin.  He's the guy who says he bought the beer.  What's up?  Colin.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got you on the air, man.  Hey, what's up?  How'd you get your beer?  I walked into some shop.  I just paid for it.  Did they know you were underage?  No, I had an ID.  Ah, the old fake ID.  You got the fake ID working?  Yeah.  Where did you get it?  Somewhere on 8th Avenue.  It's a little decrepit shop.  God damn, they're still doing that in Times Square area? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  And what was, obviously, the person behind the counter was not an American.  No, he was Bindi.  That is hilarious.  We used to get our fake IDs in Times Square when we were growing up.  No, I didn't get the ID in Times Square.  That's where I got the beer.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I borrowed the fake ID from my friend.  Remember all those shops when we were growing up in?  You could get the fake IDs and stuff in Times Square area.  They never worked, though.  No.  All right.  Well, do you look 21, I guess, or the guy just didn't care?  I don't think the guy, I mean, I could pass, maybe, but the guy really didn't give a crap. 
[00:59:00]  Well, everyone on the phone lines is saying, let the kids in.  I think you should let us in, too.  God, we'd get screwed, though, man.  You guys brought beer.  You're underage.  Yeah.  Maybe that.  We walked.  Do you know how far we walked?  This one kid's got a, Nick's got, like, a broken leg.  And you guys walked with beer through Manhattan?  We walked through.  My back is killing me.  All right.  Well, leave the beer upstairs, because I swear someone will try to crucify us.  All right.  Trust me, if you're at my place, we'd share beer together, you know, but they have rules around here. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  All right.  Get Rick.  All right, Rick.  Yeah.  All right.  Just leave the beer upstairs and have them come down and say hi.  Okay.  All right?  Yeah.  We'll get screwed if they bring the beer down here.  You got it.  Look at us showing responsibility.  The boss is out of town.  Yeah.  What the hell is wrong with you guys?  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  We could easily pull this one off today.  You know why?  We just don't want them drinking the beer, so we have more for us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rick, I think you're going to have to confiscate their beer.  Yeah, definitely. 
[01:00:00]  Confiscate the beer.  Put it in the evidence locker in our office.  Yeah, the food fridge.  It's marked food and beer fridge.  And what's in the food fridge?  Oh, beer.  Right.  What's in the beer fridge?  Beer.  Right.  All right, Rick.  We'll see you in a bit.  All right.  See you in a bit.  All right.  Guests always trying to stop in.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  How are you?  Good.  You could make a fake ID on the PC.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, the way PCs are now and printers.  Oh, my God.  They're amazing what you can do.  Yeah, you just get the scanner. 
[01:00:30]  You scan your regular license in.  Mm-hmm.  You take out the power that says under 21 and change the date.  Yeah, you can change around the date, the names, pictures, everything.  You can manipulate everything on those.  Yeah, it's great.  It's amazing.  Does it look really good?  Yeah.  Yay.  And the only thing, you can't touch it, but the looks are great as long as they don't  pull it out.  As long as they don't pull it out of the thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, you just flash it in your wallet or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  God, we didn't have that when we were growing up.  I knew some guy, Ope, some guy that actually printed out $100 bills on the printer. 
[01:01:00]  Some guy, wink, wink, some guy, some guy, some guy, fronts and backs on a piece of crap printer.  And obviously, you know, if you handle them and look at them closely, you're going to tell.  It's not a real $100 bill.  So, but in certain circumstances, there are those in pants.  Get over there.  Look at these clowns.  Hey, guys, what's up, man?  Look at this.  Guys just stopping in, singing hi.  All right, call for school, huh? 
[01:01:30]  Thanks, man.  Bye.  What school you got?  Samir's?  Yeah.  Catholic school, guys.  Catholic school.  Always the first with the beard.  That must suck, huh?  Catholic school, yeah.  Is it a boys' Catholic school?  Yeah.  Oh, man, what do you do?  I got girls.  My parents wanted to throw me into one of those.  I'm like, no way.  St. Anthony's or whatever, whatever the one near Huntington is?  Yeah.  I'm like, screw that.  That's crazy.  It is crazy.  What do you do for chicks during the school year?  All Catholic schools.  Like, just all girls.  Yeah?  But you don't go there during the day. 
[01:02:00]  All day long, you don't look at girls?  No.  It's horrible.  Dude, that's crazy.  What, do you look at, like, nuns and stuff?  That's all you look at?  I don't have any nuns.  There's no girls.  There's, like, no two teachers.  Whoa.  That's got to suck.  But you have these dances, I guess, and stuff, and they hook up the girls' school with the  guys' school.  I guess.  And then, yeah, there's no way to really kind of meet girls or anything.  No, it's horrible.  That's like torture.  That was the whole thing of going to school.  It was like, yeah.  I'm bumping into some girls today. 
[01:02:30]  When you're 17, you're just popping all left and right all over the place.  So what do you do besides girls?  Is it helping your studies any?  I guess you're both very good in school.  I got girls in my school, so I don't pay attention.  Oh, you don't?  Yeah.  Do you make fun of him because he doesn't have the girls in his school?  No, not really.  I make fun of him because he's with us, girl.  Ah!  You can beat us in my head.  This is great.  I love it.  What's the cough button?  That's if you have to cough.  You hit that and it doesn't go out over the air. 
[01:03:00]  But we don't care.  We like our coughs.  I'm just going to keep hitting it.  All right, guys.  What's like the cough button or something?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like going to hit it and keep hitting it.  Where's the sneeze or fart button?  So you brought some beer, huh?  Yeah.  Which one of these has the fake eye day?  Yeah, I figured that.  Let me check out the fake eye day.  You got a couple of years before that passes, dude.  Yeah.  You got any hair on your ass or anything? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I see none on your face.  Nothing.  You couldn't get away with buying beer.  Let's see that one.  He doesn't even look like me.  No.  I told you.  The guy didn't even care.  Wait, let me see.  That's not you.  Let me see that thing.  He's like white and this guy's like Dominican or something.  Look at this.  It's like the same nationality.  That's horrible.  Dude, that's sick.  Someone sold you beer with this?  Yeah.  And what about this guy?  Where's he?  I have no idea who he is.  You just had this made up? 
[01:04:00]  No, I got it from my friend who got it from somebody.  It's probably been passed down for generations.  This poor guy's like probably dead.  Wow.  You don't know who this guy is?  No idea who that guy is.  That doesn't even look like you.  Don't even come close.  That's hysterical.  Some Indian guy sold you beer?  Yeah.  That's great.  I'm glad we confiscated that.  So these two can't get in any kind of trouble.  Isn't that hysterical?  Take your hat off.  It's not a bouncer, man.  It's not the same color hair.  He's bald. 
[01:04:30]  Did you get into clubs with that thing?  No, I only used it today.  Really?  And it was.  You're batting a thousand with it.  It's like a picture of a black girl.  I know.  It's like the furthest.  It's nowhere near to it.  It's great.  Wonderful.  All right.  All right, guys.  Well, thanks for stopping in.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks for the beer.  It's always appreciated here at the show, especially after the show.  Yeah.  Because, you know, we can't drink during the show anymore.  All right.  Just shots.  What's up, Mark?  Did they bring any weed?  We'll go back out if we need it. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, right.  Let's get some underage guys to cop some weed for you.  That won't get us in.  We haven't been in enough trouble last week.  Oh, man.  Could you get some crack?  I think we need some.  Hey, Kerry, what's up?  Hey, what's happening in ONA?  Hey, you're going to tell us how you get your beer?  Yeah, yeah.  During the summer, we have 50 kids in Rockaway, New York.  We all gather down on one block, and we get together, like, the list of what everybody wants.  We call up the taxi service.  He told them to drive us down to the beer place. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Then we kick out the taxi cab driver and make him get us all the beer.  And just back in, and we meet down the beach.  And what?  Do you just pay him real well?  Yeah, yeah.  We get together a nice little tab for him, and we just abuse the crap out of him  until he does.  Yeah.  All right.  He'll eventually get out of the car and just get us our beer, you know?  All right, Kerry.  Yeah, these guys are saying you're lying.  You're lying?  Yeah.  You're a liar.  Why am I lying?  You don't kick any taxi cab out, the guy.  No, you just tell him to get the beer. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We give him all the money and give him the list.  Oh, hey, mister.  There's no difference.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He does it.  I swear to God.  Oh, yeah?  That's how you get your beer?  Yeah, why wouldn't he do it?  I don't know.  It doesn't seem like something somebody would do.  Yeah, well, you just get a couple of kids and you need to grab that little guy.  All right.  Yeah?  You don't go to the car and get the beer.  How about that?  There he is.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that kind of hurt. 
[01:06:30]  Goddamn.  You see that one shell ripped right through his thorax?  He took out all of his internal organs.  Oh.  And there goes the Apache toward the horizon.  That never gets old.  Let's go to Paul real fast.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, Dumpy, what's happening?  Did you check out the article?  It's your biggest fan, Paul.  I love this guy, though.  What's up, Paul?  Well, let me try to get a clear signal here.  No, you got a clear signal.  All right.  Did you read the article in today's paper? 
[01:07:00]  Which one?  The daily news.  There was a couple of them on each page.  No, the one in the back there says Mason and Quincy's gone.  They're bringing some other douches up in Florida?  Well, they don't have all their facts together in the paper.  Let's just put it that way.  But it's good to see that Steve is going to move on.  Well, I hear he's becoming an intern for Scott Muti at the other station, no?  Steve's a nice guy.  Susan, a nice girl.  But they really need to leave at this point.  Right.  And I also say that they're getting rid of Tom Likas or Lovelines. 
[01:07:30]  They don't know which one's got to go.  But we're voting for it, right?  Come on.  Paul, stay tuned.  You got it.  Hey, W, be good.  I'll catch you guys soon.  All right, Paul.  Later.  Paul loves you, man.  There will be some changes.  The remodeling continues here at WNEW.  But, yeah, I guess Steve's saying he's going to be out by the end of March.  Yeah, the radio message board just going crazy with the stories.  Like, how could they keep them on the air?  Like, you never hear about radio personalities giving notice or anything. 
[01:08:00]  Usually they're just gone.  Yeah.  And that's what happens.  At this point, they can't hurt us any worse.  So you just might as well keep them there.  Like, they usually do that with personalities on the air that have an audience and they can do damage.  Like, if you know you're being fired and you're on the air, you could get on, lock the studio door, and just do the F show all day long.  Just say the F word over and over again.  We're hoping Steve and Sue does the F show before they leave because then people at least will check it out.  It might bump that up to a .6 by the time they leave.  I mean, at this point, if they decide not to show up for work because they know they're leaving and there's just dead air in the morning, that will get more ratings. 
[01:08:30]  Do you think dead air would get more ratings?  Oh, yeah, because people would tune in at WNEW and go, oh, my God, dead air.  Something's going on.  That's cool.  I'm just going to keep the dead air on until I find out what the hell's going on over there.  You know what they should broadcast, maybe?  Maybe the sounds of a waves or a brook.  So you could put that on your radio in the morning and it, like, helps your sleep.  That's not a bad idea.  During the morning.  That might work, too.  I give them a lot of credit for leaving.  Well, you've got to give them some credit.  To save the ship. 
[01:09:00]  Because we only have about a year left.  I'm telling you right now.  Oh, we do?  Well, we only have a little over a year left in our contract.  Yeah.  And by the end of that year, they're going to definitely reevaluate this place and decide  what the hell to do.  Isn't it amazing?  We've been here 27 years.  Or it just feels that way.  But honestly, I think we only have about a year to turn this place around.  And then I'm telling you, they'll make some drastic decision after that.  N-E-W, polka, all day, all night.  So I'm glad they're leaving.  So they'll give us a shot at trying to turn this place around. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  I wish them the best.  Everybody's speculating.  Again, Opie.  Will Opie and Anthony go to mornings?  No.  Will they go to mornings?  I'm now saying yes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Why not?  Just mix up a little.  All right.  Let's say this.  Let's say now, yeah, we are.  Because they like to quote us on the Internet and in the papers.  Starting in a month, we'll be doing the morning show.  Opie and Anthony, mornings, N-E-W. 
[01:10:00]  Radio Chick will be doing middays.  Don and Mike from Washington will be doing our shift right now.  Afternoons.  And Ron and Fez will be doing nights.  Nights.  That's the new official lineup of N-E-W.  Starting in a month.  There you go.  You've got it.  Run with it.  Be the first to write about it in the paper.  You heard it here from Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, mornings.  Radio Chick middays.  Don and Mike afternoons.  Ron and Fez nights.  There you go.  There's the lineup.  There's the lineup. 
[01:10:30]  They finally got us.  They offered us so much money, we couldn't turn it down.  Yeah, we were just holding out for the big bucks.  That's all.  Of course.  I'm going to be clearing, I think, 30 grand.  30 G's.  Yeah.  Nice.  I'm psyched.  Nice.  All right.  Well, guys, thanks for stopping by.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  What kind of beer did you bring?  What?  You rock.  I love my butt.  We like the butt.  Cool.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Someone wants to talk about who wants to marry a multimillionaire. 
[01:11:00]  Great little story in the paper today.  Guy turns out to have a restraining order against him.  Yeah.  We'll get into that next.  And whatever else you want to talk about.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  O-B.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yo, Paisano.  Oh, I was there last week, Anthony. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  God damn, I forgot how good the food was there.  It's great.  I took a couple months off from Paisano for no real reason.  I just...  A couple of people in the neighborhood looking for you.  Maybe you didn't want to go down there, Ophie.  No, I've just been really, really busy.  Finally got down there last week.  And I'm like, man, why ain't I eating here every night of the week?  It's great.  Great food made from old-world Italian recipes.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  Yeah.  And I believe Joey's doing something right, because we're walking down Mulberry. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  And all those guys are outside.  It's like 15 degrees out.  Trying to drag you in, right?  They got their menus and their special board out on the sidewalk.  And they're like, come on, come on, come on, half price, half price, or whatever, right?  Yeah, they try to usher you into their places.  And I'm like, no, I'm going to Paisano.  Oh, the look of disgust on their faces.  They get so pissed off.  So if you are going to Paisano, make sure you say that to all the guys as you walk into Paisano.  You walk past them, and you hear them under their breath.  Damn, Joey Paisano.  Damn, damn, damn. 
[01:12:30]  I'm so sick, everybody goes to Paisano's.  And all the other restaurants where, I'm not exaggerating, completely empty, I get to Paisano,  and there's a little festive atmosphere in there.  Nice crowd, not too crowded, not too empty, just right.  It was during the week, and we had a great, great dinner.  Once again, great dinner.  That fried ravioli that you like, that you put me on to, that ruins my dinner.  Because I eat so much of that, I get full, and then I've got to take dinner home.  Because it is so good, you just pack out on that stuff. 
[01:13:00]  Fried ravioli, try it.  I want him to name it Anthony's Fried Ravioli.  Could you do that, please, Joey?  And the best part, Joey's got a new service, too.  Anthony's thick Italian sausage.  Joey started...  Joey started like a taxi service, too, man.  What?  If you're there, and you're having a fine Italian meal, and you need to go somewhere after dinner...  Wait a minute, Ovi, this might just be for you.  Oh, it's just for me?  Oh, I thought he was doing it for everyone.  What, did he personally drive you somewhere? 
[01:13:30]  Oh.  Yeah, see, I don't think he does that for everybody.  Oh.  I wish I could talk about Joey's ride.  Hello.  Oh, nice.  Oh.  Wow.  Sure.  Yeah, so I had a great dinner, and then I'm like, hey, Joey, I need to get to the Mercury Lounge.  I'll drive you.  He drove me there.  Well, I wouldn't try that.  But if you do, if you do tell them that Ovi and Anthony sent you, you'll get a free glass of wine.  Yeah.  Which is good, so then you drink the wine, and you drive yourself home.  All right, ask Joey about his taxi service. 
[01:14:00]  I'm really not sure.  His taxi service.  I don't know.  What are the rates for the first mile?  He's that type of guy, you know?  All right.  Well, you ask him that.  You see him in the restaurant.  Say, Joey, I'm going somewhere.  Can you drive me?  I didn't think he was doing me a favor.  I really just assumed this is what he does for all his, uh, is there a meter in his wine ride?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  All right.  All his customers, he drives in places.  Okay, well, try it.  Let's try it.  Call Joey.  Oh, boy.  And Joey's, uh, oh, I guess we can't announce anything yet. 
[01:14:30]  Joey's going to be a father soon.  Oh, yeah.  Soon.  We'll announce it on the radio when it happens, and then you can congratulate him when you  go down there, okay?  Right.  It's Paisano, Mulberry Street, in the heart of Little Italy.  We really love this place.  Give them a call.  965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  O.P.  Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:15:00]  Goddamn, I'm wired.  Have you had some coffee today, huh?  Yeah, I don't drink coffee very often, okay?  You know that.  I had a large, light, and sweet.  I'm like, I'm flying.  I'm like on The Sims when they go to the espresso machine.  What's your dealer out of town?  You couldn't get the crystal meth before the show today?  Yeah, that's it.  I couldn't cop any crank.  It's like, hmm, crystal meth or coffee?  I guess I'm going to have to settle for the coffee.  For the coffee.  Well, Anthony, secret's out. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah?  We're going to mornings.  Yeah, just hit the New York radio message board.  Radio message boards.  And they're very smart to report on that because I'm just tired of the speculation that keeps  being knocked around on the Internet and in the newspaper.  So we figured, let's clear the air.  I mean, Mason and Kalinsky pretty much announced they're out of here.  Yes.  March 31st.  31st.  At the latest.  I guess they're going to pay him for a couple weeks.  It's just, they ain't going to last until March 31st. 
[01:16:00]  And there's speculation as to who will be coming into NEW, which positions are going  to be jockeying around.  And we have the official lineup.  We're setting the record straight.  It was in the Daily News today.  They were commenting about the rumors and stuff.  Mm-hmm.  And the lineup will be Opie and Anthony.  It's the mornings.  Got to get up early.  Oh, no.  Radio check, middays.  Mm-hmm.  She's keeping the same hours.  Don and Mike doing afternoons.  Godspeed, guys.  We leave you our work over the past year and a half of building an audience here in the 
[01:16:30]  afternoon.  Very popular duo from Washington.  Yeah.  They do real well down there.  We'll see what they do up here.  Yeah.  And Ron and Fez from Florida doing nights, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  There you go.  That's the line.  We're announcing it on our show today.  Where do I fit in?  Come on!  Come on!  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, you're next on NEW.  What's up?  You got it.  How you doing?  Good.  I just want to let you guys know how you're going to bury Howard when you move to Mornings. 
[01:17:00]  Well, believe me, you don't stare at Mount Everest and go, hey, boy, that's an easy little  hill.  Let me just crank up there to trot.  Yeah.  Let me take a nap before I start climbing.  All right.  When you're halfway there, though, the top is closer than you think.  All right.  Halfway.  Halfway will be nice.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  All right.  Good luck.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  So there's the announcement, Anthony.  There you go.  All right.  We got Steve from the unofficial Opie and Anthony website in the studio today.  Hey.  www.foundrymusic.com. 
[01:17:30]  You spell Foundry, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y, music.com.  I always thought that was an easy word.  Evidently, it's not.  Oh, it's a nightmare.  Steve, I'm gaining respect for you by the day.  You are like a pioneer, like Jonas Salk finding a vaccine.  You actually found.  Now, but get this.  There is, you know the game The Sims that we've been into playing a lot of?  Simulated families' lives that you place in houses that you build, and you have to guide 
[01:18:00]  these people's lives or they might die.  Or you could just kill them.  Yes.  Or you could just have fun and kill them.  It turns out you play God, basically.  Yeah, you play God to these people.  Yes.  Well, when they get naked in this game, their bodies are cubed out, you know, digitally  cubed out, so you don't see them naked.  When they're taking a dump or showering or taking a bath.  Yeah, yeah.  Which kind of pisses you off.  Or changing clothes, yeah.  You buy the game, you're an adult, and you've got to look at this cubed out thing.  So, I heard stories that there were these patches, little program fixes that you could 
[01:18:30]  put into The Sims program, where they will be naked without the cubing.  Steve researched this for, I think, 28 years.  It was.  He was researching this.  And from all the info he got, he said, there is no such patch.  Maxis, the people that put the game out, denied there even being a patch.  But you did say, until someone comes up with one.  Exactly.  Amir, two days later.  Two days later, my email mailbox, like 45 messages with attachments. 
[01:19:00]  Found it, Steve.  Found it.  Here's the patch.  So, on the unofficial website is the patch to see The Sims naked.  Very nice.  And I installed it, checked it out.  It works perfectly.  Yes, it does.  Had our little couple take a bath, and there it was.  One thing troubling for the guys, though, no stuff.  No junk.  They're junkless.  The girls have little boobies.  Yes, they do.  And the guys are junkless.  Oh, like a Ken doll, huh? 
[01:19:30]  Yes.  Very much so, like a Ken doll.  Poor guy.  No genitalia to read.  That was the most sought-after patch, though.  And Steve found it.  Yeah.  It's on the unofficial website, www.foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  You're like Magellan or something.  I tell you, you know, since we started talking about The Sims, all the computer stores are sold out of this damn game.  We have people around here that have the game on order and stuff.  They've been searching, like, four or five different places.  They can't find the game.  I'm at the point now where I built up a couple, and I don't want to play it anymore because I don't want to wreck it. 
[01:20:00]  Like, they're doing very well, and I'll feel all guilty if they fall apart at some point.  So I haven't even touched that particular couple.  I did make one because you can download skins off of this thing.  I downloaded a Captain Kirk skin, and it looks just like Captain Kirk walking around this neighborhood for some reason.  And I put him in a one-room house where the bathroom is right next to the bedroom, and there's no refrigerator.  And you know what he does?  He keeps knocking on the door of the couple next door to get food.  It's the funny thing.  I'm hungry. 
[01:20:30]  I need food.  Please, anything.  So I'm sorry I'm brandy.  Anything.  I'm famished.  That's classic.  And we've heard from people that are trying to make skins that look like the people here on the show.  Like you guys, yeah.  Because you can download a program where you can make your own characters and even make the looks of them.  So if you know what the people on the show look like from the pictures on the website, you can make your own skins.  And since we've been talking about the Sims, the funniest discussion we've had is that kid on Friday, the normal kid,  that was like, what, 18, 19 years old, who is a serial killer in the Sims world? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  God, I was talking about that with my brothers and friends this weekend.  We were laughing so hard.  You make a little death room.  Right.  And then you invite the people in the house.  You call them over into the death room.  You leave and then block the door with something and let them starve to death.  And then you get a little tombstone.  All you have to do is get them to walk out into the yard somewhere and pause the game and you wall them up.  And they're like a little two-by-two.  And they just sit there and they pee themselves and they cry and they die. 
[01:21:30]  There's another version of that.  I was reading an email before the show today.  A guy, he has the death room upstairs.  The death room.  And so he walks the people upstairs and as soon as they get up there, he erases the stairs.  That's right.  That's a good one.  So they're like peeking over the second floor and they can't get downstairs to eat and stuff and they die.  Yeah.  I've done that.  I've got one house with one guy left in it and a whole bunch of tombstones out in the yard.  There's ghosts that show up.  Yeah.  Every couple minutes because so many people have died.  This game is great. 
[01:22:00]  It's like a little death room with just urns and garbage in it because these people just, they go in, you know, you stick a fridge in there and then you erase the fridge.  So they have nowhere to go to the bathroom and nowhere to throw the trash.  You know, we've all blown off our games to play The Sims.  Yeah.  And it's a huge half-lifer.  I've been spending some time with the Tiger Wolves, Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods PlayStation game.  Yeah.  And now I'm blowing it all off to play The Sims.  Yeah.  I guess you're, man.  I got the kid the other day.  Oh, you did?  What?  Dropped off a kid?  What a pain in the ass.  You got to, like, take care of it for three straight days and then it turns into, like, a regular child. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  I was crying all the time.  Yeah.  So I had shifts going where one was sleeping, one was up.  It was a pain in the ass.  You can't imagine doing that in real life.  They took mine away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did they take it away from you?  Uh-huh.  Irresponsible bastard.  I know.  You can't even care for a digital kid.  I was too busy watching the big screen TV.  I was playing with the electric train.  Exactly.  Hey, Nick, what's going on?  Yeah, I downloaded this patch.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  And I can't get it to get on my computer.  I was called to see if you guys could tell me what I need to do, man.  Do you know where to put it?  Uh, no.  Not sure.  Uh, did you read the readme file?  Yeah, that's right.  There's a file in that little zipped package that tells you exactly where you have to put it.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, do that, man.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes.  I called in before.  I told you I'd get the ghost.  Did you get it yet?  Yeah.  Well, what's the, you, um, yeah, explain that again because that's kind of cool.  You kill them, right?  Right.  And then you take the urn outside before anyone has a chance to mourn it. 
[01:23:30]  That's right, yeah.  And then a ghost appears.  And you get a ghost in your house.  Cool.  And you can make, uh, characters of people you know.  Like, I got my roommate and my friend made.  And I'll have them come over.  And I'll be like, yo, Darren, check this out.  They'll be like, what?  And I'll make them tickle my roommate and stuff and he freaks out.  Jesus Christ.  I'll be like, look, dude.  You're going to hug Jim now.  You're going to hug Jim.  And he'll be like, no, no, don't do it, man.  I'm like, oh, yeah, look, I'm going to make him fall in love.  Freaks out.  You can have Stiles and Earl fall in love, man. 
[01:24:00]  That's not what I was saying Jesus Christ about.  Hey, turn around.  Did I need to see that?  Nick, I got to go.  All right.  Jay Moore is showing his junk to everyone in the studio.  Jay Moore is like, thanks, guys.  Jay Moore pulls his pants down.  That's great, Jay.  Thanks, man.  We got to take a break.  We're going to talk to Jay Moore.  His last day in New York, he's going to leave us for a long time.  Going to Vegas.  Going to Vegas.  Vegas.  We'll talk to him next.  Stay there. 
[01:24:30]  What did you learn on the show?  I learned I'm a functioning idiot without a high school diploma to get a job on the radio.  Now, Obie and Anthony.  Theater of the Mindless.  1027.  W.N.E.W.  Get your head out of your ass, Dad.  Douchebag.  Yeah, Dad.  Get your head out of your ass.  Did you see Rushmore?  Yeah.  That's a great movie.  He goes, I'm going to invite that kid to the party.  He goes, the guy's a dork.  Yeah, Dad.  Get your head out of your ass.  Don't worry.  It's Axeman in the car. 
[01:25:00]  Jay Moore back in the studio.  I have nothing to plug.  I'm here.  You're done.  I'm here out of just love for the Obie and Anthony show.  Boy, thanks for finally throwing us a bone.  Way too long.  Yeah, he threw me about 130,000 bones.  100 plugs does one show for free.  That's not bad.  You don't have any other gigs in New York, the area, Jersey, nowhere.  Unless they're going to cover charge at the United Terminal.  Okay, tomorrow morning.  You're leaving tomorrow morning?  Vegas.  And you're going to call them doing this movie, pay it forward, and they go. 
[01:25:30]  That's not a plug, by the way, because I didn't even start filming it.  It'll be a while before it's out.  Yeah, so, and it's straight to video.  My luck, you know.  Jay Moore, great rental.  That's my head.  Saturday, wanted to rent a movie.  I went for Suicide Kings.  Gone.  They only have one copy of Blockbuster.  Why do you rent from Blockbuster?  They edit out the masturbation scene in Bad Lieutenant because they don't think it's appropriate.  Really?  They do their own editing at Blockbuster?  I've never heard of that.  They're big Christians.  Right?  Get on the mic.  That sucks.  Mike DeNicola. 
[01:26:00]  They, yeah, they edit out the offensive scenes, and the guy who owns it also contributes to Operation Rescue,  the people who blow up the abortion clinics.  Well, so do I.  I support the time.  The politics is out.  And they have no porno.  That's the big one.  Yeah.  And I don't go to Blockbuster.  I don't feel good about walking into a video store that doesn't have that curtain, you know.  Oh, and swinging.  Over 21 only.  Oh, bless.  It's like a wild one.  Woo-hoo!  Wild one.  You walk in there, fight a few rounds in the ceiling.  I'm like, where's my porno?  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Q-ball rag with an afro.  Do you have to get a few legitimate videos before you go in there?  No.  No.  No.  The son tells me Jay Moore.  Now, Jay Moore runs in and just goes right to the front.  Where's the effin' section?  Yeah, Jay goes right for it.  Where's Rocco, stiff and red?  I'm so shameless.  When it comes to the porno.  I need teenage assholes.  Yeah.  Not as good as the book, by the way.  No, it's so easy.  I hope you got a little hairdo.  I thought you got my hair.  A little hairdo? 
[01:27:00]  I like it.  Is that right?  Guys aren't supposed to notice other guys getting haircuts, Jay.  Well, we know how gay I am.  You know what?  I swear to God, you're the first guy that noticed.  Rick, no one said anything.  No, we don't notice.  You know what happened?  I was just in, you know, this is what I noticed.  I was at Paisano's last night with a friend of mine.  Yeah.  I was there last week.  And I saw the picture on the wall of YouTube.  With the swath.  You like the swath lip?  Yeah, swath lip.  And you had really long hair.  Yeah.  And then when I came in, your hair was noticeably shorter.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Okay. 
[01:27:30]  And it looks like you got your eyebrows done, too.  Actually, she trims my eyebrows.  Maybe I am, Jay.  Dude, why did I just notice that?  What is up with that, though?  I don't know.  Why did you get your eyebrows done?  Hey, Stephen Lynch.  Hey.  Look at his knocking.  He wants to look at you.  What are you doing out there?  Stephen Lynch and me were in Boston together in a hotel room.  The guy cleaned out my minibar.  The good news is Stephen Lynch is here.  The bad news is I don't see a guitar.  Oh, God.  Hey.  No, it's getting tuned up for the big show on Thursday.  That's right.  Thursday.  He's doing a whole lot. 
[01:28:00]  Tuned up.  What are you, send it out?  Yeah.  He's going to send it out.  I don't know how to do it.  I've got to give it to somebody.  I'm retarded.  I can barely play the goddamn thing.  You have no guitar here?  No, I don't.  I don't.  You know.  No.  What are you going to do?  Just talk?  Yeah.  He's going to talk about the controversy.  He's going to hang out and drink beer.  How are you going to sing half a man with no guitar?  I'll do it acapella.  Play Opie's eyebrow.  Jay, shut up.  The controversy that is Stephen's new song, Stomp on a Fetus.  I love that one, right?  Jay, what was the suggestion you had for me? 
[01:28:30]  Full-blown AIDS.  Yeah, let's say, uh, what's going on the new album?  Pretty funny.  Should we be out soon?  I told him, he's in my hotel room in Boston.  We were both doing this thing for college.  It's like a college conference.  And, uh, he goes, I did my show and I brought him up on stage second show Friday and, uh,  he killed.  It was great.  It was awesome.  It was like when you guys came up.  So awesome.  Yeah, wasn't I pumping them to hell out of there?  And then somebody goes, they suck.  I go, F you, you suck.  They called the guy out, some salty Irishman from Southie, right? 
[01:29:00]  You're doing your clean bit from Southie, your non-X-rated bit at the college thing.  Yeah.  And a girl stands up and goes, oh, put the map on the...  You've got to set it up, though.  Go ahead.  This NACA conference is National Association of Campus Activities.  They inducted me into their Hall of Fame.  Hall of Fame.  It's me and, like, Carrot Top.  Good company.  I think I'm going to be there after, uh, my showing this weekend, by the way.  It's Anthony Clark and me are the two members.  But it's, you have to be completely...  Once you get to the college, you can just do whatever you want, because the check's there,  they flee out, they're stuck.  Right.  They already paid you. 
[01:29:30]  But there's, like, 1,500 people in this theater, and it's all the kids who don't care, but  there's always the advisor, or if it's Texas Christian University, it's the priest, or if  it's all the ministers.  Oh, boy.  Clean act.  Yeah, totally clean.  I didn't even say damn, hell, nothing.  So you're trying out your act, so these colleges will hire you, obviously.  Right.  You know, that's where you make the money.  Right.  You get, like, 30 grand a pop, and they fly in.  It's like, you know, you get five colleges.  Wait, you only get 30 grand?  Yeah.  Funny, Steve.  I get $122 for 30 bates.  That's 30 grand that you took out of my mini bar. 
[01:30:00]  So I'm doing it completely clean, and I'm, like, going, so, you know, my dog, and I'm  doing, like, the clean set, and this girl goes, make a map of a lot of you in my back!  And I do, like, a quad-octumple take, and I go, what?  And she goes, make a map of Hawaii on my back, please, Jerry!  2,000 people don't know what she's talking about.  They start a fly. 
[01:30:30]  And I want to say, I'm, like, but I'm, like, oh, lady, you know, easy.  I gotta, I gotta work clean, you know, and, uh, everyone's, like, what is he, what's so,  we're so bad about that?  Yeah, map of Hawaii.  Yeah, that's funny.  And it's just so strange, like, this college girl from, like, wherever.  You know, and then after my show, uh, Lynch kills, he does half a man, and, uh, if I were  gay, and, uh, he did the guy for Smashing Pumpkins if he lost his car keys.  That's one of my favorites.  And then, uh, they're, like, let's go to the club next door, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:31:00]  I gotta save my voice, because, you know, I'm a big girly, and I lose my voice.  And, uh, so I'm, like, no, I'm just going back to my room, you know, I'm gonna drink a  bottle of NyQuil and pass off for 15 hours.  And they're, like, no, let's go out.  It's him and Mark Tyke, his buddy, Mark.  So we finally get back to my room, and literally 12 beers, two, you know the little bottles  in the minicar?  Yeah.  Two bottles of Glyn Fittich, two bottles of Jack Daniels, a couple shots of NyQuil, and  he's asking me for Klonopin. 
[01:31:30]  It's, like, complete, and the more he drinks, the more he knows how to play.  I'm, like, going, play, uh, you know, in the white room.  It's just, like, the more he drank, you know, and he was sober, he's, like, I don't really  know that one.  I'm, like, dude, Block Star by Radiohead.  He's, like, dude, I don't know what he's drinking.  We're just trying to get it out.  I didn't even know you were going to be at the conference, and I show up, and there's  this picture, you know, showcase tonight, Jay Moore.  Yeah.  So I have my little backstage pass, and I'm, like, I'm going to go meet him, man.  I feel like, I feel like Luca Brasi on the, you know, Connie's wedding day. 
[01:32:00]  Practicing, I am a big fan of yours, and, uh, I am too on the Opie and Anthony show.  I hope your first child will be a masculine child.  What are you saying, Ted?  So what are you, I switch to Sam Adams now, or there's no more Bud?  That's what happened.  He switched to Sam.  That's funny, man.  My hotel bill was, like, fully paid for, except for the mini Bud was $190.  I swear to God, that's not a joke.  It was a $190 mini Bud. 
[01:32:30]  Hey, you don't drink.  No.  I'll pay you, man.  I'll pay you, man.  And all, like, the chocolate.  That's, like, five drinks.  Yeah, I know.  You could ring up a tab pretty quick in those things.  It was a privilege.  I had a bottle of water.  I went up to the, I just had a tab going for Corvette and the boys.  And then I go up to the bar, and I go, uh, let me just get a bottle of Avion.  But let me drink it out of the bottle, because I'm not allowed to let you do that.  I'm like, I'll stand here.  Just let me drink it out of the bottle.  She goes, what are you, like a weirdo?  I go, yeah, I'm a weirdo.  I'll drink it out of the bottle.  I enjoy it that way.  She goes, that's $9.  And I thought she was teasing me, because I was a weirdo. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  She was.  It was $9.  $9 for water.  Jesus Christ.  They're buying water, Norton.  Chalk it up.  Chalk them up.  He's buying water.  We got a guy that was doing Jay Moore chants at your show.  Scott.  Yo.  Hold on.  You better go get Pawn a Guitar in a hurry.  You were doing chants at Jay's?  Somebody's got one.  Bring it down.  Me and my buddy were up there on the second show Friday when Stephen came up.  Yeah.  And, you know, Jay's doing his bit, and about 25 minutes to the show, he stops and he goes,  and he'll listen to Opie and Anthony.  And at that point, me and my buddy and two other guys just go nuts. 
[01:33:30]  That's right.  Are you the guy who wants to be an intern here?  No, that's my buddy Jason.  Oh, okay.  I met him after the show.  Right.  Yeah, that guy said he would do anything.  I said, they might ask you, like, take a dump in a wastebasket and film it.  He goes, I don't care.  I'll do it.  So, tell him to get off my back.  Did you have to dump that?  No, that's fine.  I just see you hitting the buttons.  I don't know if you're done.  No, no, no, no.  So, I told the guy, he goes, put in the word for me.  So, there's the word.  Now, let's get going.  We were waiting at the bar for you. 
[01:34:00]  But, anyway, we're yelling Bush Expert, and he yelled out Ingrid.  Oh, cool.  I told you.  Somebody yelled out Ingrid.  Somebody yelled out Ingrid in Boston.  That's cool.  Nobody knows what we're talking about.  All of a sudden, we yelled out.  Jay Moore, Bush Expert, Buddy Hackett.  He went on a whole 20-minute bit on Buddy Hackett.  I don't know where it came from.  It just came out from me and my buddy yelling.  Oh, awesome.  You guys helped me out.  And Stephen was awesome.  It was a really unbelievable show.  All right.  Cool, man.  Thank you, Scott.  And tell your friend they put the word in for him.  All right.  Appreciate it.  All right.  Thanks for coming to the show.  That was a good show. 
[01:34:30]  I had a really good time.  We had a great time.  We've got to get a guitar for Stephen Lynch.  I know.  What are you thinking?  Mine's in the shop.  I've got to, you know, get it set up.  In the shop.  In the Jeep?  Chelsea guitar.  This is Jay Moore's going away party.  He's leaving us tomorrow.  We're the horse, Norton.  No.  We can get you a guitar.  Okay.  I don't have a guitar.  I don't know where.  Where's Vince Scalza's eight, 12-string?  Any faithful listeners in the area with a little acoustic guitar?  That's pretty good.  Wait, Mark, you got one?  Well, I mean... 
[01:35:00]  You got a, what, a cheap one?  There's a couple in the prize closet, but they're autographed.  The one made out of a goddamn cigar box and a twig.  Get it out of the prize closet.  Take the one that's signed by Aerosmith down off the wall.  Jay, you really got to leave tomorrow, right?  We're having our huge road show Thursday.  I know.  Believe me, I know.  People would freak if you walked down on stage.  Stephen Lynch is doing a whole set or whatever.  He's doing 20, 30 minutes for us on Thursday.  You got to play Special Olympics today.  You love the Special Olympics?  Yeah, but he won't play it because he can get boot off stage or anything.  You get boot off stage now? 
[01:35:30]  I have been.  Come on.  I know, seriously.  Where are you playing it?  The Special Olympics?  You know, opening the song, the opening song of the Special Olympics.  He got that one lyric where he goes, I know I'm going to hell, and I go, that lets you  up the hook.  I'm getting to the audience that what you're doing is wrong.  Yeah, yeah.  You saw my act.  Look at me.  I whipped a gay guy, you know, come on.  The whole Rascal's West Orange, everyone's like, bag, bag, bag, bag.  And I told the guy he would fight.  Oh, man.  All right, let's try to get him a guitar. 
[01:36:00]  Let's take a break here.  We're doing the road show this Thursday at Mulcahy's in Wontaw.  If you stick around for like a minute, we have all the details, okay?  As we go to break, it's Stephen Lynch on tape.  This is the song called If the Guy from the Smashing Pumpkins...  Wait, how's it going, Steve?  What if that guy from Smashing Pumpkins lost his car keys?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Where the f*** are my car keys? 
[01:36:30]  They were right here in my hand.  I had him just a second ago.  Did I leave them in the kitchen or underneath the cushions of the couch?  I can't find them anywhere, any...  Oh, here they are.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off. 
[01:37:00]  Okay, you'll open it.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  All right, we're trying to get Stephen Lynch a guitar.  Do you want an acoustic or do you want to try something with the electric?  We only have an electric.  Who is that signed by?  I'm just hoping that maybe Stephen will sign it.  Someone's got to be...  Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Someone's got to be close to the station with the good acoustic guitar.  We'll let you into the studio if you've got a guitar for Stephen Lynch, okay? 
[01:37:30]  You've got to get here immediately, though.  If you're close, please help out the show.  Acoustic guitar, here's the studio.  There you go.  All right, real fast, we've got to talk about Fidelity Diamond, Anthony.  Ah, yes, the engagement ring specialist.  You might have missed Valentine's Day, didn't you?  Well, you could have a plan.  You missed Valentine's Day.  She was expecting it on Valentine's Day.  That's why you didn't give her the engagement ring on Valentine's Day.  Now you give her the engagement ring.  Oh, now she's totally surprised.  She freaks out.  That's how to do it.  And where do you go?  Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist. 
[01:38:00]  And if you do get the engagement ring at Fidelity Diamond, your lady's going to give you a...  A Hummer.  A Hummer, guaranteed, man.  She's going to hob your knob if you go to Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist.  Diamonds equal Hummers.  Now, is that a guarantee from Fidelity Diamond, or we're just assuming that the ladies will  hob some knob if they get their ring from Fidelity Diamond?  I don't think it's on the bottom of your sales receipt, you know, guaranteed Hummer.  I wouldn't think so.  Maybe on the bottom of the box, you could go, you know, now hob my knob or something. 
[01:38:30]  How romantic.  Honey, will you marry me?  Yes.  Turn over the box.  Hob my knob.  All right.  The big news about Fidelity Diamond, you will not get ripped off there.  Oh, they educate you about buying diamonds.  Most people don't know about buying diamonds.  Step by step, they'll walk you through it.  Yes, you buy it loose, like you picked out your girl.  Loose.  And you could check out the diamond.  The top, the bottom, the sides.  They educate you about diamonds. 
[01:39:00]  Cut, clarity, carat, all that stuff that you need to know.  And then you pick out your setting.  And they put it together right there in front of you.  There you go.  And if you buy your diamond engagement ring at Fidelity Diamond, you're going to get a platinum engagement ring setting for free.  That's a $500 value.  Fidelity Diamond, located at Route 17 South in Paramus, just minutes from Manhattan in Rockland County.  And to give them a call, Fidelity Diamond, 201.  Just minutes.  Just minutes.  201-261-6555, you ask.  201-261-6555 for Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist. 
[01:39:30]  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Okay, you got Anthony.  Yes, yes.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  My motto.  You recognize the bowie, huh, Jake?  A little wonder, a little wonder, a little wonder, a little wonder. 
[01:40:00]  I'm getting it.  It's going to be a father.  It's his electrical.  Uma.  Yeah.  Pregnant or whatever.  Emon.  Emon, that's right.  Uma.  Emon.  Emon.  Emon.  Wouldn't you get her pregnant?  I don't find her hot.  Really?  I think the Tyra's hot.  Tyra's got those big breast disease.  Totally fake.  No, they're not.  Oh, stop it.  They're not.  Just stop right now.  Tyra Banks?  I don't think they're fake.  Tyra Banks.  I don't think they're fake.  Gotta be fake.  You're questioning?  They're big. 
[01:40:30]  You're questioning my pimp hand?  Yes.  This, I gotta question you.  No way.  Tyra Banks, gotta be fake.  They're hanging down.  They're jumping a little longer.  She's got that big, huge forehead, though.  Tyra Colax.  Like a beluga whale.  Oh, my God.  Beluga whale sonar head.  So do I.  Let me see.  You got a five head?  Not like, no.  No, you don't got the Tyra Banks forehead.  Well, she got the short A head.  Yeah.  The hairline starts at the top of the head.  You're getting a hummer.  It's like I'm getting a hummer from a bald guy. 
[01:41:00]  How is that, Jay?  It's all right.  Uncle Pappy.  We got a couple good phone calls here.  Cindy, you're next on the radio show.  What's up?  We got Jay Moore in the studio and, of course, Stephen Lynch as well.  We're going to have a lot of fun today.  Cindy.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  What do you have to add to this mess?  Listen, I need to ask you guys something.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm kind of embarrassed.  All right.  Be careful because I see what you want to say on the screen.  You've got to kind of talk in code so they don't dump out of our show.  All right.  All right.  In honor of Tuesday night, hummer night, you know, you guys, you're a whole big hummer 
[01:41:30]  thing.  I hear kids in the back.  That's a big time.  Are those your kids?  Yeah.  It's like walking in deer hunting.  No more.  Get the kid out of the room.  It's just a little baby.  It's just a little baby, nothing.  Oh, the kids are a little baby.  Then bring them over here.  So, anyway, I could take the start, but I can't finish going all the way.  All right.  And I need tips from your guys' listeners.  They should swallow the chowder.  What's the tip?  I will if I get that far, but I get bored and there's nothing else to do. 
[01:42:00]  Well, maybe you don't do it well and it takes too long.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  She's talking about hummers with a kid in the background.  That doesn't work.  That's even too sick for us.  Damn.  Thank God.  I just swallowed my chew.  Yeah, Jay's gagging.  Just settle my stomach.  Is it your husband, we're assuming?  Yes.  Anybody, it takes a long time to finish?  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  That usually means, with all due respect, you're not doing a very good job.  Are you using the hand?  Oh, nice.  I try.  I don't know.  It gets sloppy.  Are you?  Well, the sloppier, the better.  The sloppier, the better.  Listen, when you go up with your mouth.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's okay.  We don't even know what we're talking about.  Well, I just want it on the air.  Yeah, I know.  It'll be in the air.  At least you're talking about eating a popsicle.  Yeah.  When you're eating a popsicle, Cindy?  Yes?  Okay, shut the kid up, because I will vomit if I have to talk to your kid. 
[01:43:00]  It's like walking and deer hunting.  The prostitute and the kid's tending her.  No, no more.  Not the kids.  No more.  Get the kid out of the room.  No, no more.  No more.  And she's like, no, come back.  No, you come back.  No more.  No.  No more.  Oh, come on.  Is he on the phone now?  Oh, she hung on.  But you can still explain.  What you were going to say.  Isn't that horrible?  So gross to have a kid. 
[01:43:30]  Explain it.  So then you take it and you grab the shaft.  It's a pebble.  It's a flea stone in the background.  There's only two parts you have to worry about.  The head.  That's why it's called testicles.  Picture like a big apartment building.  Leave everyone in the middle of apartments alone.  Let them sleep.  It's either the penthouse or the boiler room.  And when you come up with your head, you're, all right, all right, I'm going to keep this 
[01:44:00]  all in the air.  Yeah.  Your hand should be attached to your mouth.  So far so good, right?  Very good.  Very good.  We don't even know what you're talking about, Jay, at this point.  When you come up with your head, you have to take your head completely away from the Popsicle  so that your hand now is at the very top of the Popsicle so that there's actually like  a masturbatory effect.  And then you go back down into the mouth.  Bravo.  Oh, goodness. 
[01:44:30]  Now, let me ask you something.  Jay, will you come to the bathroom with me, please?  No.  Jay, when you say the hand, you don't mean the little ring, right?  You're talking about the hole in the face.  Yeah, that's a very good point, Steve.  Because that's annoying, too.  Let's break this down.  It's like De Niro and Kate Pierce.  Well, let's break that down.  Yeah, ladies, don't do like the ring as Stephen Lynch is doing.  No.  You are funny without the guitar.  You've got five minutes.  You've got a new five minutes right there.  Don't do the thumb and pointer finger ring going up and down. 
[01:45:00]  It's like that makes us feel like, you know, pretty thin and stupid.  Get your whole hand on it.  I think the ring technique is for our own use only in quick situations.  Yeah, yeah.  And the free hand should either be on our ass or on yourself.  In plain view of us.  Look how much I'm enjoying doing this that I'm actually touching myself.  And we go, wow, she's a little freak.  There you go.  I agree.  Hummer tips from Jay. 
[01:45:30]  That's great.  On this Hummer Tuesday.  Bravo.  I forgot it's Hummer Tuesday.  Yes, it's Hummer Tuesday.  That's such a crazy day.  I forgot all about it.  Oh, man.  So that was good, right?  Yeah, that worked.  Very informative.  You guys are going to remix this for the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  It's going to be like Jay Moore giving a gay guy.  You're going to mix in Marco going, really?  Really?  We'll have the station voice.  More proof that Jay Moore's gay.  On N.E.W.  Vince Scalza, this is a very interesting guy. 
[01:46:00]  Jay Moore, the original band, talking about how this is.  Scalza, that's a great show.  You know what his show is like?  I love his show.  Do you watch Apocalypse Now?  You've seen the movie.  Yeah.  The Marlon Brando character.  That is Vince.  He is on the station.  No one knows what he does.  It's way in the wee hours of Sunday or something.  We're trying to build a station here, but we don't even care what he's doing over there in the corner.  Someone has to just, I don't know, execute him with something. 
[01:46:30]  No way.  Terminate with extreme prejudice.  I am pro Vince Scalza.  It's great.  N.E.W.  I can't believe I'm still at N.E.W.  No.  All right.  R.J., what's going on?  R.J.  You mean Andre?  Whatever your name is.  That's all right.  Bez does it every time.  All right.  One thing that Jay didn't mention.  By the way, Jay, I love your work, man.  You're the best.  Thanks a lot, pal.  One thing that nobody ever mentions is that, I know I'm going to get dumped. 
[01:47:00]  Well, just talk in code, man.  All right.  We can get anything.  Now, that's an example of what not to say.  Thank you, Jay.  We had a dump out of that one.  That was just for the people on hold.  Sometimes we've got to do a show just for the people on hold.  Anthony tells me, I want to do a show just for the people on hold.  Yeah.  Sometimes I've just got to say that.  Then you go to the phones, and they're just laughing uncontrollably.  Great.  We just entertained four people.  All right.  So what do you got for Jay?  All right.  Big thing. 
[01:47:30]  The hand cannot actually leave the skin.  If there's rubbing, you know what I mean?  The difference between...  Oh, like grabbing the skin on a Sharpay or something.  And then moving it back and forth.  Moving it back and forth.  Your hand isn't actually moving on the skin, but you can move from head to tail on that damn dog.  I think the key word here is friction.  Right.  Friction.  Yes.  Well, there could be a certain amount of lubricant involved.  Right.  Because if you did that to a popsicle, it would break in half. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  Exactly.  Let's keep that in mind.  Nobody ever mentions that, and that's like the biggest...  There are different techniques for different circumstances.  You can use the rub technique if there are some byproduct of the act, maybe, regardless of where it comes from.  A little viscosity.  A whole lot of byproduct.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  In a motor oil commercial.  When her hand breaks down viscosity, it could cause an injury. 
[01:48:30]  Don't let this happen to you.  All right, man.  We're going to let you go.  All right.  Yeah, don't pull on it to a lever to a cigarette machine is what I mean.  Slide it up and down.  Slide it.  Yeah.  You don't want to throw a rod.  That's true.  Yeah.  Carmen, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  You're sexy.  I had phone sex with Jay last time you was in.  Oh, you had phone sex with Jay.  I was on the phone.  I was on the phone, and you did it.  Yeah, you guys, you came to visit for a while, and I had phone sex with you, having to use whale  knots and all that booboon.  Yeah, I was in L.A. 
[01:49:00]  I was in L.A.  Exactly.  Whale knots.  You got a kid in the background, too.  Oh, my God.  What are you guys doing?  What are you, roommates?  What are you, Cindy, roommates?  What?  Are you and Cindy roommates?  You got a kid in the back, too.  No, not roommates.  I'm a married woman.  All right, Carmen, what do you got for us here?  Now, proper technique is make sure that you lick the inside of your hand first so that  we have that lubricant.  That way, so you have connection with the lips. 
[01:49:30]  And especially these times, you have to get around the tip of the head.  All right, Carmen.  Hold on, baby.  I got to lube up the hand.  There we go.  It's like that prison rape scene.  What were you, having sex with Thorpe from The White Shadow?  Hold on, baby.  Thorpe from The White Shadow.  Wow, what a reference.  Wow, where did that come from?  Who's giving you a hover?  Is it Haywood?  I don't know.  Hold on, baby.  She sounded like an African woman. 
[01:50:00]  I was just doing the stereotypical African woman voice, Jay.  I don't even think anyone heard Carmen in Radioland.  Why?  She was dump central, man.  They dumped out of all that.  Really?  Why?  Spit on the hand?  What'd she say?  I didn't disagree with that technique.  Spit on the hand?  Yeah.  Oh, that's like a prison rape thing.  I don't know.  Spit, lick.  It's like, how romantic.  Come here, baby.  Quack.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Huggy bear.  Huggy bear.  Dwayne, Wayne, what's happening?  Hey, hey, hey.  Quack.  Oh, God.  Thanks, Rick, for the assistance.  Hey, rerun.  Dwayne's with your girl.  Quack.  Mike, what's up?  Shirley Hemphill.  Quack.  The late Shirley Hemphill.  Oh, what, Jay?  Why?  You can't make fun of Shirley Hemphill because she's dead?  Give her a month.  Jeez.  She's still rotting.  Hey, Mikey, what's up?  She's still rotting. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, guys.  Carcass will be rotting for a while.  What's up, Mike?  Question for you.  You guys are opening up a whole new realm here.  It's a whole new world.  Don't you dare close your eyes.  How about the gas lightning technique?  What's that?  Yeah, and they make the same face at the end as I do when the gas hits me in the face.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You know that face.  Pah.  Pah.  Pah.  Pah.  Pah. 
[01:51:30]  Pah.  Then there's the no friction but lots of noise technique.  Yeah.  All right, Mike.  We're going to let you go.  The gas siphon.  That's thermal breakdown.  That was a reference to women not finishing, I guess.  Yes.  Now, you know, I do that whole joke in my act about women not finishing.  I'm trying to remember it now.  It was like, why would you ever put it there if you don't?  Yeah, that's right.  You don't stare into the garden hose.  You don't stare into the garden hose because your friend might turn it up. 
[01:52:00]  You don't put it in your mouth and play with the knob.  You know, ever go to a friend's house and he takes his gun out to show you, but you're  not expecting it and you're like, whoa, hey, hey.  Did you take somebody to surprise?  You're like, whoa, I can go off.  Put that away.  You don't put it in your mouth and massage the trigger.  Nice gun.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Licky, lick.  Bah.  Hey, you said you wouldn't shoot me in the face.  You can tell Jay's got no more dates here in New York.  He's doing his whole act today.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  That's okay.  We ain't going to see him for a while.  I saved the best stuff for you guys.  Hey, did we get a guitar that works to the board?  Mm-hmm.  Are you drinking a beer over there?  Hell, no.  There's no beer allowed in the studio.  Steven Lynch, baby.  Oh, wow.  He does?  All right.  Do you have full-blown AIDS down here?  I'm working on it.  He'll be there tomorrow.  Oh, you mean the song?  Yeah.  That's Who Do You Love.  He started on that day.  Keep playing that. 
[01:53:00]  Nice.  I did a hell of a job tuning this.  Yeah, Who Do You Love.  Who Do You Love.  Unplugged.  Jake Moore.  147 miles of barbed wire.  Got a corporate stake for a necktie.  Right on top of the bed at a human skull.  Come on, take a little walk with me, baby.  Tell me who do you love.  Who do you love, full-blown AIDS. 
[01:53:30]  Full-blown AIDS.  Let's see if we can get a song out there.  Full-blown AIDS.  I'm down to my fighting weight.  I'm down to my fighting weight.  Full-blown AIDS.  All right.  What do you got over there, Steven?  Oh, yeah.  Somebody requested that Harry Chapin song.  You remember that one?  Ah, yeah.  I like this one.  It's funnier when he gets drunk,  or so somebody get him a shot of something. 
[01:54:00]  Way ahead of you, man.  All right, this is about it.  Here, drink my dip cup.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Mmm.  You know, one of our listeners...  The trick is you can't just take a sip.  It all goes down in one piece.  One of our listeners did.  Let's get one of our listeners to drink out of your dip cup.  They'll do it.  Oh, dude.  Come on.  What do we got to give away?  They'll boof, right?  They will boof the second it hits their mouth.  You come down and drink out of Jay's dip cup,  we'll set you up with some prizes today.  I'd rather see triangles and mohawks 
[01:54:30]  if you're trying to give them prizes.  All right.  Yeah, this is Jay's kind of going away party,  so it's your lady with a mohawk.  Come on down.  I like when you guys...  I was listening earlier when you guys slammed Slayton.  He's like, you got Jay Moore,  you went to the Jay Moore show,  and you go, you know the difference between you and Jay Moore?  He was here yesterday.  I had five lesbians on the couch.  What do you got?  What are you going to see?  You got CDs.  You heard that?  That's great.  That was awesome.  I like Slayton, though.  All right, Lince, let's go.  All right.  He's going to ruin your song. 
[01:55:00]  I know, I already feel it.  It's going in the morning.  He's not going to let you get through it.  Believe me, I'm letting everybody know  what the title of the song is.  I flaked him down at the corner  and he picked me up at the light.  I told him where I was going 
[01:55:30]  and we drove off into the night.  How's it going, my friend?  I asked him.  Slowly he turned his head.  The taxi driver looked at me  and this is what he said.  He said,  What do you want me to tell me 
[01:56:00]  I can take late in the night  to be sad?  I mean, it's close  and I don't get changed  to the 22nd and let's say  that's the nature.  Okay, we all have a good day.  Now I know that's a receipt.  Okay, good night.  Goodbye.  Reminds me of the controversy  of the first time  we had him play that song.  Remember that?  Yeah, 25 minutes  before I could play it.  Before it was cleared  by our NEW censors.  We got new bosses though.  Now we're allowed to  do whatever we want again.  Write the twat song. 
[01:56:30]  We can let it roll.  Stephen Lynch  is going to be  doing our road show  this Thursday.  Okay, yeah.  I'm so jealous.  That's going to be fun.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  That's going to be well over.  They're always a lot of fun.  Yeah.  You know why Stephen  likes it the most?  Booze.  Yeah.  Booze.  Booze.  You're going to be in Vegas.  You'll be like  eight naked chicks  in front of Stephen  and be like,  is that beer?  Look over their heads.  It's beer.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We'll be back.  It's Jay Moore  and Stephen Lynch  hanging out with us today. 
[01:57:00]  Jay Moore  leaving for Vegas  tomorrow morning.  Leaving for Vegas.  So you think Spacey  is going to win?  He better.  Yeah.  That'd be great  for your movie, man.  I know.  Yeah.  Ellen Hunt just won the Oscar  to Little Kids  and the Three People nominated.  There you go.  She's got a big forehead, huh?  But I'm in it  so that's the kiss of death.  CDRecordable.com.  Yeah, this is great, man.  Wave of the future.  People are making  their own CDs  recording on CD recordables.  My brother has joined the rage. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  He's got a burner  and I believe he went  to CDRecordable.com  to get the cheap CDs  and he's making  all his Buffett CDs  at the house.  That's what it is.  You make your custom mixes  of music  if you want to do that.  If you're a band,  it's a lot more convenient  to make a CD  than a tape.  A lot of radio stations  don't play tapes.  Correct.  You need a CD.  You want to back up data  off of your computer.  You have all those  video files  from the unofficial website  that you've downloaded  onto your computer.  What the hell  are you going to do with them?  They're taking up space  on your hard drive.  You could dump them all  onto CDRecordable  and store them that way. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  They'll be at your fingertips.  You could trade them  with your friends.  Now, there's two things  going on with CDRecordable.com.  First of all,  you could get the CDs,  the recordable CDs  at a very cheap price  because you're not  dealing with the middle man.  You're going right  to the manufacturer himself  pretty much.  Not dealing with overseas either.  What do you want?  You need a CD recordable?  Wait a minute.  We will have that  shipped out to you  in eight months.  That junk is leaving Korea  right now.  Burn up CD recordable.  Yeah, and of course  you need a CD burner 
[01:58:30]  if you're going to make  your own CDs.  Yes.  And CDRecordable.com  can take care of you  as far as that goes  as well, okay?  And they have  cool different colored CDs.  Yes.  I think that's pretty neat.  You could color code  your music or your data  from your computer.  Whatever you want.  Color code it.  There you go.  Log on to CDRecordable.com.

Should have potted that mic 
[01:59:30]  up a little sooner.  When I was cursing?  Yeah.  O-F-O-S.  Click.  Hi.  I was talking the NBA  with Jay Moore, Anthony.  A little sports break.  Rick Petit.  So you got to curse so much?  Because I was trying to remember  It's guy talk.  Yeah, I was trying to remember  one of the Boston Celtics' names  that got traded.  Yeah, Mercer.  Thank you.  1027 WNEW.  Doesn't matter to anyone else.  Jay Moore.  Steve Lynch at the studio.  Are you guys going  to Sue Kalinske and friends?  No. 
[02:00:00]  It's something we talk about  a lot on the show  is women of comedy.  Judy Gold's on the show.  Ah, who else?  Jay, we got an announcement  to make.  I don't need an announcement.  Steve and Sue are leaving.  They're leaving the 31st of March.  Of March, if not sooner.  So when's my slot?  New lineup here at WNEW.  Opie and Anthony doing mornings.  Morning drive.  No way.  Radio Chick doing middays.  Mm-hmm.  Don and Mike doing afternoons.  Who's Don and Mike?  From Washington.  Don and Mike. 
[02:00:30]  And Ron and Fez doing nights.  Where's my slot?  You want a slot?  No.  You're part of our slot.  I know it.  Yeah.  And that's why I would never  take a slot.  Are you really doing mornings?  You're going head to head?  Mornings.  That's going to be...  Well, there we go.  It's in all the papers,  so we figured we'd make it  official.  Everyone's speculating.  There's rumors all over the place.  So, sure.  We just gave out the lineup  for the new WNEW.  I can't stand opening up the paper  and you read all these boneheads.  They can't get it right.  Who's staying?  Who's going?  Who the...  Opie and Anthony.  To mornings?  No.  Yes.  What?  Spell it out. 
[02:01:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  We're doing mornings.  They finally got us.  A week ago, you guys were going,  we're not going to mornings.  No way.  We were just bumping out  for the big bucks.  Yeah.  You know how negotiations work.  You know how negotiations work.  Did you get a bump?  We got a bump.  Did you get a door deal?  Yeah.  We're getting the door.  We get the door deal.  Any door deal.  I'm the only white guy  to get the door.  Hey, Tracy, what's up?  Hey, I know Jay knows  probably a little bit more  than I do as far as Hummers,  but I give one at least...  Wait, what's that supposed to mean?  What's that mean? 
[02:01:30]  No, I mean receiving.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Because I'm a man.  I like heterosexual sex a lot.  I do this at least  four times a week  to my boyfriend.  All right.  I never need to use my hand.  No?  No.  You're a double amputee, right?  I know.  Use your feet like a monkey.  Use your feet, Jackie.  No.  If you cut the popsicle well enough,  you don't need to use  any other thing for friction.  Really?  How far away from the studio are you? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, we could try out your technique.  I'm Stephen Lynch.  So what do you do?  Juggle in the meantime?  So if you can get him off,  you know you're good.  What time is it now?  5.30?  I don't know.  All right, Tracy, thank you.  Wait, wait, hold on.  So what is it?  You just keep sucking the popsicle  and you don't need your hands at all?  Well, I mean, I can't.  Crazy.  So you got a great mouth  is what you're saying.  I've been told.  What's your nickname?  Hoover?  Yeah.  What does it do?  What's the magic?  I like that one. 
[02:02:30]  What's the magic  that you don't need hands  that you could entertain  your husband with card tricks  as you do it?  No, no, I didn't say that.  It's just that I enjoy it so  and I just said...  That's the key, ladies.  She enjoys it.  Maybe it's one of those  quick drama draws  that, like, the second  something happens, it's over.  Do you give them the look?  Do you look up at them?  Oh, a lot?  Yes, I do.  See, I don't like the look.  How come?  I don't know.  I'm thinking of somebody else.  I love when they play  I love when they play  Point of Star.  No, Jay, they got to make 
[02:03:00]  those eyes like those  old paintings.  I just came from privilege.  I'm thinking of the Chinese girl  with fake boobs.  And then my wife  locks eyes at me  and I'm like,  oh, it's you again.  I mean, you're beautiful  and I married you,  but, you know.  Well, are you looking  down watching?  Yeah, of course.  I get the hair out of the way.  But I'd rather look at it  in the mirror  and make pretend  I'm in a porno.  But then I realize  like halfway through  that I'm only looking  at myself.  I'm only looking  at my abs and triceps.  Jesus Christ, man. 
[02:03:30]  I don't want to see  because those guys,  you know,  I want to make sure  I'm in shape.  It's one day.  I'm going right into it.  You're lucky  you were late today  because Jay Moore  walked into the studio  pretty much naked.  Yeah, with his pants down.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that before.  Don't worry.  Oh, yeah.  You showed him  your junk pill?  No, I showed him  my vagina.  In Boston,  we were in the hotel room  and it was him  and his buddy  and I go,  you guys want to see  I have a secret.  Oh, no.  You pulled that one  where you stick your junk.  But the thing is,  no, no, no.  He told us to come up.  When we come up  the elevator,  the door's already half open.  We open it up 
[02:04:00]  and he's on all four.  That's right.  That's right.  All fours was.  I smelled Rusty Penny  before I even got  through the door.  I opened it up  and there he is.  How about all fours  giving him a brown eye?  Oh, man.  Jesus.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Look.  Come on.  We're on the radio.  A million people are laughing  and a million people are vomiting.  It's all about the radio, man.  You invite the guys up.  You're completely naked  in your room  on all fours.  It wasn't naked.  I had just taken a dump  and I was coming out  of the bathroom  and I was all clean  and then the door 
[02:04:30]  was, you know,  across from the toilet.  So I dropped...  That makes the story  much better, right?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  So I dropped his shorts  and I just gave him  the whale eye  and then they walked...  So they'd have to, like,  walk in and just  look right into it.  Yeah.  He actually stayed that way  for about a half an hour  and we just tried  to chuck M&Ms in there.  No, I waited  for you guys to finish.  I waited for both of you  to finish like a gentleman.  That was sweet.  Anything else, Tracy?  No, guys.  That was it.  But you guys are great.  I'm going to miss you  in the afternoon.  Yeah.  Well, listen to him  in the morning. 
[02:05:00]  What else are you going  to do in the morning?  I'm going to give  my hummers in the morning.  All right.  Well, as you're doing that.  All right, Tracy.  Thank you.  See you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Taking over the .5 rating slot  in Morning Drive Radio  here at M&W.  A lot of mixed feelings  about us going to Morning Sand.  I know.  All right, let's go to...  A lot of controversy.  Oh, a very famous person  on the line here, Anthony.  Bridget from  Let's Make Bridget Cry.  Oh, we remember her.  Bridget.  My boyfriend dumped me.  You can't say that, Jay. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, she's a pig  and she gives hummers.  Am I wrong?  She's a little pig.  I would have done  the same thing  right after I...  Ugh.  Ugh.  Disgusting.  It's absolutely disgusting.  I'm still trying to make her...  Hey, Bridget,  is the bump  on the back of your head  healed yet?  Yeah, it's fine.  I'll give you a new one.  I would have thrown you  so you cracked your head  open on the oven.  Jesus.  That is so disgusting.  You got what you deserve.  So, you're sad  that Jay's leaving, huh?  Well, I'm a little less sad now. 
[02:06:00]  I was just playing the band.  I know she's a big Jay Moore fan.  I was just playing  Make Bridget Cry.  Hi, Bridget.  How are you?  I'm fine.  When do we get to play  Make Bridget Cry again?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  All right.  When do we get to play  Make Bridget Shake  Like a Car on Bad Gas?  That's a secret code  for orgasm.  All right.  So, you're sad, Jay.  Bridget, I was only 
[02:06:30]  playing the game.  I don't want anybody  to think that I'm  really just that mean.  But everyone  thinks I am anyway.  I'm still going to  miss you, Jay.  I'm sorry.  I'll be back, honey.  Okay.  I'll be back.  Call Rascals and say,  when's Jay Moore back?  Okay.  All right.  Give him the door.  All the door.  All right.  There goes Bridget.  Thanks, Bridget.  Bye.  I feel bad now.  I'm like making him cry.  I'm just calling to  wish me a safe flight  and I'm on the charcoal  briquette halfway  over at Denver.  Jay, what's going on?  I'm right here.  What do you think?  Jay, what's up?  All right. 
[02:07:00]  That old gag.  The old one right here.  Hey, Jay.  What?  The guy on the phone.  Who are you?  Hello?  What is that?  He's got a guitar.  Is that Jay?  Hello?  Wait, no.  Yeah, he's got a guitar.  Is that you?  Is that this Jay?  On the phone.  All right.  Who's on the phone?  Hello?  You're on the air.  Or Steven.  All right.  He wanted to talk about  the multimillionaire  who married on Fox  last week. 
[02:07:30]  Oh.  Didn't you have some info  on Rick Rockwell there, Jay?  He was on Star.  He was a star star trying to run.  He lost to like Sinbad.  And now it's three and a half stars.  Metalog Lemon gives you one star.  Guy's judging your whole life.  The parrot from Beretta.  Two and a quarter stars.  No, I remember he had a suit  and the suit was printed like money.  The whole suit was dollar bills.  And he goes,  you know,  I've been on the show  for consecutive weeks. 
[02:08:00]  I guess you can tell him  I'm putting my money  into my wardrobe.  I remember watching  Mr. Leonard.  Well,  I like a Rick Rockwell.  Every city you go to,  you do morning radio.  Like when I'm promoting these gigs,  they all got,  it's not like Mr. Leonard.  They got like,  you know,  Mr. Bob.  Mr. Peebles.  Mr. Someone.  It's always been just someone.  And it's some guy.  It's just some douche.  I was doing radio in Cleveland  with Barry Sobel  and he brought me along.  Barry Sobel's hilarious. 
[02:08:30]  He's funny.  He's still around?  Yeah.  He burned a lot of bridges.  That's right here.  It's the,  it was the  We'll Never Play Here Again tour.  Ah.  Is what he named it like  half joking  and then realized  he wasn't half joking.  We're on the radio  and it's like,  we're in Cleveland  and it's the number one  like morning hacky show  in Cleveland  and let's talk to Mr. Bob.  And it's like a normal guy.  Like,  he looked like the partner  on Home Improvement  with the beard.  Right.  And the guy goes,  well,  as you can tell  we have a snowstorm coming  and Sobel just goes, 
[02:09:00]  whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  Why are you talking like that?  Well, what do you mean?  And he goes,  whoa, whoa.  And they had like drumsticks  and Sobel takes him away  from the guy  and like hides him  like a child.  He's like,  dude, dude,  what are you doing?  Why are you talking like that?  Why are you talking like that?  And the guy goes,  well,  I,  well,  took him out of his,  like,  and then they go to a commercial  and they pull him aside  and like,  Mr. Bob,  is one of the most popular figures  in all of Cleveland.  You have to understand.  He's an icon.  Yeah,  it was literally like 
[02:09:30]  they completely freaked out,  they kicked us out,  and they,  Mr. Bob,  Mr. Bob.  Oh,  and then I,  then I had my own Cleveland scud.  Hey,  Lynch,  how about a song,  man?  Yeah.  You got another little,  you know,  salty Irishman over the corner?  What do you want to hear?  Full on AIDS.  It's not done yet.  I'm down to my target weight.  Lynch playing our road show  Thursday,  Mulcahy's in Wontong.  Oh my God.  How about,  Doors of the West?  Doors of the West?  Doors of the West.  Doors of the West.  Special Ed?  You never heard half,  you never did half a man here.  Yeah,  I did that. 
[02:10:00]  Oh,  special ed?  Special ed rocks.  You told me you didn't do half a man here.  No,  I did do half a man here.  The first time I played here,  I did that.  Every,  every so often that,  uh,  special ed will just be in my head.  You know,  you wake up in the morning,  it's like,  God damn,  that's Stephen Lynch.  It's stuck in my head.  I like the part when he gets hit in the face with the brick.  Little twist at the end of the hotline.  You didn't expect it.  Is it a Rod Serling written?  Yeah.  It's a twist,  and then the twist.  Like,  you know,  Willoughby Mobile Home. 
[02:10:30]  Willoughby Funeral Services.  A pitiful portrait of a macabre musician.  And his retarded friend.  A special ed.  What else you got, man?  You can write like a song a month.  What is this?  Hey,  hey,  you're being generous when you say that.  I got the CD sampler at my house.  I'm playing it for my roommate.  My roommate's like,  no,  I heard that too.  I'm like,  how do you know this song?  What do you want to play?  I don't care.  Play Freebird while you're at it.  Jeez.  Oh,  oh my.  Wow.  What do you know?  Jay totally laying in. 
[02:11:00]  Well,  it's like,  you know,  you come on the show,  I have the new bits.  Jay's protecting it.  Jay's like spraying,  it's like a tiger spraying the walls.  Yeah.  My territory.  No,  it's everyone's territory,  but you,  I mean,  Louis Black had a whole joke about the sharper image.  He comes in,  he lays down the new stuff.  He didn't show up just so he doesn't have to drink beer in the cold.  Hey man.  What?  Hey man,  I'm a musician.  I'm not a comic.  God damn.  You are a comic. 
[02:11:30]  You're one of the funniest guys I've ever seen in my life,  man.  You just keep writing.  Down to my target weight,  sarcoma has popped out all over my face.  I think you're writing the next one for me.  That's like the Nicole who wrote that down.  A little Jackie Marley.  How do you guys feel about going head to head?  Mornings against the Sternmeister. 
[02:12:00]  You excited?  I think excited like the guy that's waiting to climb Everest,  you know,  you're looking up there.  You're like,  I could die up there.  They leave the bodies up on Everest,  you know.  You're like,  Jesus Christ,  base camp is 12,000 feet.  What am I doing?  Names flash across my eyes.  Danny Bonaduce.  Gary and O'Toole.  Gary and O'Toole.  Gary and O'Toole.  Oh yeah.  Stephen Lynch.  Stephen Lynch.  Oh.  Rocky Allen.  Rocky Allen.  Yeah,  well.  Ouch. 
[02:12:30]  Ophie and Anthony.  Stephen Sue.  Stephen Sue.  God,  they didn't even get out of the tour bus.  Ophie.  Did you feel like?  That was a good one.  Nathan's in the back with like a game of Tiger.  He's like,  let me just save the game.  I'll be right out.  God.  It's already canceled.  Can I keep the bus?  Lynch hit us, man.  Oh my God.  They didn't even put on their North Face jacket.  It's over, man.  I don't even know who you guys are talking about. 
[02:13:00]  Game over.  Stephen Sue.  Oh,  they did mornings here for the past year and a half.  That's a good sign.  Driving a 1.5 down to a .5.  That's like when people go,  when were you on Saturday Night Live?  And I go,  exactly.  That's why I left.  You would always be out at the end waving.  Yeah.  Good night,  everybody.  Good night.  Good night.  Good night.  Good night.  Good night.  That and the Andrew McCarthy and the,  uh,  the Welcome Back Hotter,  uh,  Walkin'.  Walkin' selling Skittles.  Doing a Skittles commercial.  I'm good for you.  And cover great flavors.  Lemon, lime, 
[02:13:30]  grape.  Look,  you should get Skittles.  Cause,  without water,  melon,  passion fruit,  Skittles,  there's many in a bag.  You don't get just,  you don't get one.  I need Skittles.  Stephen,  play something.  Come on.  The Fender still has the power.  Yeah.  A rainbow of fruit flavor.  Huh. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  It's a rainbow of fruit.  Forget it.  Come on,  you salty Irishman,  play a song.  Play the song,  I'm so drunk,  I don't know what the plane is.  That's your big closer.  What a drunk.  You know,  my hotel boat was $195  and it was a free hotel.  They're drinking the wine.  They're like,  oh,  there's no more beer.  Let's get to the red wine.  The refrigerated red wine,  like cheap Italians.  Oh,  with the screw top. 
[02:14:30]  The cold red wine.  Ah,  the screw top.  The screw top.  It was in a box.  I love this.  The box.  The wine.  Box of wine.  Come on,  Gallop.  All right,  let's hear Stephen Lynch.  What do you want to hear?  I still don't know what's going on.  Special ad.  You think a hole comes out of his thing?  What do you guys want to hear?  Only the kinks did that.  Kill a kitten.  Yeah,  kill a kitten a lie.  That's pretty timely.  Ah.  Really?  Yeah.  Very controversial.  With the good ending.  He's getting so much hate mail,  it's not even funny.  Hate email.  I know.  They told me in Boston,  in between vomiting. 
[02:15:00]  Holy smoke.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting,  it helps a lot if you kill a kitten.  Mark my words,  Cause from where I'm sitting, 
[02:15:30]  you can't go wrong if you kill a kitten.  There's no crime that should be committing.  I know the law you can kill a kitten. 
[02:16:00]  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting,  you'll get plenty when you kill a kitten.  Feed a turpentine or break its spine.  Crush it with your shoe and know the shoe. 
[02:16:30]  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  But if the one you love isn't quite as sweet a tongue,  she'll like you better when you kill a kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, 
[02:17:00]  cause that's where it's repentant.  If he'll kill a kitten.  If he'll love it, Jesus,  he must kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Drown it in a lake.  Bake a kitty cake.  Throw him at a train.  Make him snort cocaine.  Hit him with your van. 
[02:17:30]  Flush him down the can.  Steak some tea and tea.  Up his cat poutine.  Do what you must do.  As long as you.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten. 
[02:18:00]  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Killer kitten, little furry kitten 
[02:18:30]  Killer little kitty got to kill him  Like you got to stab him with the kitty  Got to hang him with the kitty  Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine, nine  Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine, nine  Wow!  Yeah, Steven Lynch, everyone.  Jaymore backing vocals.  Has anybody ever heard that song on your show? 
[02:19:00]  Poor Steven getting pounded because of that song.  What's Jay doing?  Will you be performing that live Thursday?  I'm okay.  He's on that.  Very good.  Steven Lynch playing our road show Thursday.  What's he making deals on the phone during the show?  He's talking to his manager.  100% of the door.  100% of the door.  It doesn't work for anything less.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Hello.  Yeah, I thought I checked it on.  Tell us to the conversation here.  That has no place on this show. 
[02:19:30]  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNAW.  Anthony Rockaway Benning.  Yes.  We love it.  Hey, hey, Steven.  You know rock, rock, rock, rock, rock and roll high school?  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock.  Yeah.  No.  Maybe you can play that on the guitar.  Ramones?  Is that this?  You know?  Yeah, I'm going to...  No, I don't know. 
[02:20:00]  I don't care about mattress stains.  Rock, rock, rock, rockaway bedding.  They'll haul it away.  Give me a steel bed frame.  Rock, rock, rock, rockaway bedding.  My Rockaway mattress is so thick.  It doesn't hurt her when I bang my chick.  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rockaway bedding.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Thank you.  Rockaway bedding.  The Ramones, ladies and gentlemen.  Over 130 stores throughout New York.  That's a lot of stores.  New Jersey.  Brand name mattresses.  Brooklyn, Queens, all over. 
[02:20:30]  A lot of stores.  At up to a 65% below department store.  Regular prices.  More than half of them.  Rockaway bedding is the only major area mattress store that offers you frills.  Friel.  Frials.  Free steel bed frame.  I don't know what that means.  Free delivery and free complete removal of your old, stained, lumpy, crappy mattress.  Who wants that?  No, you don't want that outside.  People know your business.  Definitely don't want that.  Scrape DNA off and clone you.  Yeah.  Well, that's, you know, maybe your name is.  Rockaway bedding guarantees you a better night's sleep with your new mattress purchase.  And a better night's sleep is the most important reason for your new mattress purchase. 
[02:21:00]  You can shop in one of Rockaway bedding's area stores or call 1-800-TRYABED.  Spell that.  1-800-T-R-Y-A-B-E-D.  Try a bed, right, man.  Try a bed.  Rockaway bedding.  The best and friendliest place to get your brand name mattress.  Right, Mr. J?  I have a queen-size bed in my apartment from Rockaway bedding.  Yes, I opted for the king.  It is truly a Titanic-size mattress.  It's got the mother of all beds.  You can do that when you live in Queens. 
[02:21:30]  I don't.  I live in Brooklyn.  Yeah, well, you get a bigger apartment.  Hey, come on, huh?  I'm in Manhattan.  You know, I could take a dump and do it at the same time.  You often do.  Yeah, apparently.  Yeah, we learned that today.  Rockaway bedding is the official provider of mattresses for Anthony and Jay Moore.  Opie.  You scum.  What changed you into such demonical little bastards?  1-0-7.  Kick-ass.  W-N-E-W.  Kick-ass.  Kick-ass.  Steven Lynch in the studio. 
[02:22:00]  Jay Moore in the studio before he flies out to Vegas tomorrow.  Hey.  We're kind of screwing off.  It's his last show for a while with us.  It's rock and roll, Jay.  Hey, look to your right.  Look at this.  You're such an idiot.  I'm sure you guys are coming to the morning.  Dude's got the big Howard wig on.  I found it in Psycho Mark's drawer. 
[02:22:30]  I was looking at the girls of Opie and Anthony on the web.  That is a pretty hot sight, my friend.  That's cool.  What do we only have to compete with?  A 10-share?  No, it's funny about...  That's not bad, right?  No, it's funny about...  We've got to work from a .5 up to a 10.  No, that's cool.  Number one.  No, it's funny about the Howard wig.  Steve Mason has been wearing it for the last six months, hoping that would change his luck  in the world.  No, he's wearing it so nobody would recognize him.  I think we've got a song over there, Lynch.  All right, hold on.  We've got Chris on the line.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:23:00]  How are you doing?  You like that killer kitten song, huh?  Oh, man.  What is wrong with you people, man?  What's the problem?  Man, I don't know what the hell's going on.  Yo, Steve, you still there?  Yeah, I'm still here.  What's wrong with you, man?  What the hell are you talking about a freaking killing a kitten?  You know very well if you kill a freaking older cat, they give you more of a fight.  Oh, I see.  See, opiate was like a turnabout thing.  Oh, I gotcha.  Like it.  Yo, it's the couch guy.  All right.  What's going on?  Thanks, Chris.  All right.  We'll see you Thursday at a road show.  You got it.  All right, man.  Later.  Road show.  Okay, he's going to talk. 
[02:23:30]  Doors open at 7.  We'll be there right after the show at 8.  Hell, yeah.  So what are we going to do over there?  Jay, did you write a song?  Jay just wrote a song.  I didn't write that.  I think he wants to perform it.  Come here.  Look at him.  Look at Jay.  He's a ghost writer.  Here he comes.  Is he going to perform it?  Is this full-blown AIDS?  Yeah, where's his guitar?  Oh, sorry.  All right, man.  Here you go.  Well, the Kill a Kitten song was so controversial.  I guess these guys figured out. 
[02:24:00]  No, wait.  I was going to say, wait.  We have nothing to do with this.  These guys figured out.  I don't have anything to do with this either.  We're holding the guitar.  All right.  Come on, Beck.  What are you giving me the mic for?  Take the heat off of the kitten thing by writing a song that may be a little less offensive  called what?  Full-blown AIDS, this is called?  I think Crush a Fetus would have been better.  You've got to ask the author of the song, Mike DiNicola.  Yeah, Mike, you come sing the song.  You don't really want me to sing it.  You want to hit Mike sing?  Sounds like someone's going to get it.  I'll take the hit for the authorship. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, he'll take the hit for the authorship.  It's his song that you're going to sing.  I'm not singing.  I can't sing.  Oh, yeah.  He's singing like a bird every note that Stephen's playing.  I can't sing.  It's like the Harlem Boys Choir.  Sing a song.  Harlan?  You are drunk.  Come on.  It's like the Harlan.  If I sing this song, my plane is going down tomorrow.  There's no way around it.  I'm on an MD-80 from L.A. to Vegas.  MD-80? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Those things are going down like a $5 whore.  Come on.  It's the safest planes you can get on now.  MD-80?  7.67, Bob.  That's when I'm taking to L.A.  Those rules.  And then I get to Vegas.  Oh.  He's not going to sing it.  And you should sing it.  Why would you sing it?  You sing Special Olympics.  I don't know.  You make fun of retarded people.  I don't know.  They've been working it out, doing commercials and stuff.  They've been rehearsing.  I thought Stephen Lynch had stones.  I guess I was wrong.  Oh.  Come on.  Come on. 
[02:25:30]  Who's walking away?  Come on.  Sing a song.  They wrote the song.  He wrote it.  Sing it.  You and Mike wrote it.  Me and Mike.  Look.  People like Casey are so offended.  Every time Mike wrote a line, he'd pass it to Jay.  Jay would read it and start laughing and staring at all.  It's a funny song.  So?  All right.  Mike, come here.  Sing the song.  Why won't you sing it?  Mike really can't sing.  I really have a bad voice.  That mic's not on because it's Mike saying something.  Voice moise.  It doesn't matter.  Come on. 
[02:26:00]  Sing the song.  Stephen, why won't you sing it?  Because I didn't write it.  It's not my song.  I would sing it, but I don't know the...  I've never heard how it goes with the music.  I haven't either.  We're just making it up.  And take a look at it.  I know you could...  No, no.  Stephen had it before.  He was singing it during commercials.  Stephen was working it out.  He already had the chords down.  He worked out a bridge.  Oh, my God.  You got a whole song written.  Somebody say something.  There's people listening to the show.  Oh, we're just reading it. 
[02:26:30]  Ed's looking at the jugs on her.  Look at the girl in the corner.  No, Ed's looking it over.  It's okay.  We're going to morning drive.  We don't care about this slot anymore.  We're going to try to leave afternoons at a .5 before we go to morning.  Well, Lynch is helping you on that.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Come on.  It's your song.  You won't take credit for it.  You just called here to tell me about my flight information.  He said, that Stephen Lynch guy is really funny.  Tell him to call me.  All right.  That's what he said.  And this will put you over the top, man.  Oh, yeah.  Right over the top.  He won't answer my phone calls if I see this. 
[02:27:00]  Steve, booby, baby.  This will put you over the top.  No, wait.  Not now, darling.  Not now.  Look, you're very talented.  I don't know what you do, but I'm never wrong about these things.  Come on, Mike.  I don't think so.  You wrote it.  You wrote it, man.  Sing it.  Martin.  Stephen, why don't you just do it?  I can't do it, man.  Why?  Because it's not my song.  I didn't write the song.  No, I just tuned.  You're not my tune.  You wrote the music.  It's called Live My Love Pump.  All right.  Stephen Lynch.  You guys, when you're at the tour stop in Mulcahy's, you can just heckle.  Every song you sing, you can just start screaming, FBA. 
[02:27:30]  FBA.  What does that mean?  Full-blown AIDS.  Full-blown AIDS?  Oh, I'll do it there.  No, I'm kidding.  Why don't you do it now?  Come on, I understand.  You wrote the song and now you don't want to sing it?  That would suck.  Like, everywhere you go, people start shouting full-blown AIDS.  It's like, Jesus Christ, man.  For the people that don't know why, they're shouting it.  It's like Peter Golenbach in Sparky Lyle's book.  It's like a Spinal Tap song.  Come on.  Well, Stephen.  All right.  Instead of arguing for that. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, no, we're not softening it.  Dino's like, Dinacola goes, we'll soften it.  No, you can't soften it.  No compromising.  It's either.  All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll play the music.  I'll read the words that are in front of me.  How's that?  Oh, he just sang it.  All right.  What a beautiful boy.  She's telling Jim Buckley for crying out loud.  It's called Full-Blown AIDS, and it's not written by me.  Yes.  What's it written by?  It's written by Mike Dinacola.  Just in case the Grammys are listening and want to know who penned it.  You know, Mike wants his ASCAP money.  He'll be at Caroline this weekend if you guys want to protest. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  We're here, Rick.  We're here.  You're dead.  We're going to kill you, Mike Dinacola.  Everyone's saying on the phone lines, don't be a pussy.  Sing the song.  Oh, they're calling you.  They're talking to you, though, not to me.  I'm not the guy with the guitar.  The guy comes in with a 12-pack.  This guy has a guitar.  The scary part is he's got the music worked out.  I know.  He does.  He comes in with a 12-pack, forgets his guitar.  You're a guitar act.  All right.  This is called, what is this called again? 
[02:29:00]  Authors of the song?  Jay?  Jay, what's this called?  It's called Full Blown AIDS.  Down to my target weight.  Sarcoma has popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth in all my friends.  Looks like I'm nearing the end.  No use tellin' a lie or even a film.  When you're lyin' in bed, countin' all your ribs. 
[02:29:30]  You try to kill for blood, but you showed me the door.  Well, I went to stand up when I fell on the floor.  It's full-blown.  Damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  I said, damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  All right. 
[02:30:00]  That was Jay and Mike.  Steve, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Jay and Mike.  I can't believe you would play a song like that.  That's probably the most offensive thing I've ever heard in my life.  Jay and Mike.  Just reading what they wrote in front of me.  Yeah, and everybody knows who wrote Living La Vida Loca.  I left.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That could be the most offensive song I've ever heard in my life.  Worse than Special Ed. 
[02:30:30]  Special Olympics.  No one's calling us.  No one's calling.  They just quietly turned off the radio.  They blacked out.  GLAAD is massing in front of the building.  What's GLAAD stand for?  You don't know, do you?  Gay and lesbian action.  Don't try it.  Don't try it.  GLAAD is like a movie award you get.  All right.  No, it's a gay and lesbian.  What does the AD stand for?  Action.  Anti-defamation.  Oh, that's good. 
[02:31:00]  No, that's GLAAD-al.  Don't go.  What are you talking?  GLAAD is a gay.  You should know that, Jay.  Action won a GLAAD award.  Huh?  Action won a GLAAD award.  Yeah, gay.  Yeah, one because it's gay.  I'd much rather have that than kiss a guy.  All right.  You kissed a guy in that.  No, not kiss a guy.  No video.  On action?  No, not on action.  Oh, on action.  Okay, I was thinking of go.  Oh, so it's different?  Hey, and let's...  It's different that it was a movie or a joke?  I'm a billionaire. 
[02:31:30]  I'm a billionaire.  All right.  If they say go kiss that guy, here's your check.  And we got the lyrics.  Let's put the lyrics on eBay.  What?  Oh, we're going to auction off the handwritten lyrics?  Let me sign it first.  Hey, Jay, could you sign that for me?  I didn't sign my handwriting.  Get it here, Mike.  Sign it, because we're going to frame it and put it in our office.  Here you go, Mike.  The most offensive song.  You could be in the Guinness Book of World Records for writing the most offensive song ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Song was great. 
[02:32:00]  Song was a pisser.  The song is bad.  Most offensive song ever.  The reviews are coming in.  Hey, Lynch, you want to play If I Were Jay?  A lot of people suggesting.  Well, I'm going to play something nice, like Daisy Hill Puppy for you.  No, no, this is good.  You know what song, If I...  Well, play If I Were Jay.  We got one more from Steve.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Well, the only reason we did that is to take the heat off Killer Kitty.  All right.  Well, yeah.  He's going to sing a special song for you, Jay.  No one's even thinking about Killer Kitty right now.  No.  But he's going to sing a special song about you, Jay. 
[02:32:30]  Check this one out.  I did not write that song.  And by the way, the true writer of that song will be at Caroline's this weekend, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  That show I was supposed to do.  Okay, listen.  Don't we have a relationship?  He's got a...  Here we are, dear old friend.  You and I, drunk again.  The laughs have been had and tears have been shed.  Maybe the whiskey's gone to my head.  But if I were Jay, I would give you my heart. 
[02:33:00]  And if I were Jay, you'd be my work of art.  And if I were Jay, we would swim in romance.  But I'm not Jay.  So get your hand out of my pen.  Oh, keep going.  It's not that I don't care.  I do.  I just don't see myself in you. 
[02:33:30]  Another time.  Another scene.  I'd be right behind you.  If you know what I mean.  Cause if I would get Jay, I would give you my soul.  And if I were Jay, I would give you my home.  And if I were Jay, we would tear down the walls.  But I'm not Jay.  So won't you stop cupping my bones.  We've never hugged. 
[02:34:00]  We've never kissed.  I've never been intimate with your fist.  But you have opened brand new doors.  And over here, I'll drop your drums. 
[02:34:30]  If I were Jay.  Even I enjoyed that.  That was funny.  All right.  Offensive like the other ones.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to, you know,  put a sense to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  O.B. and Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible. 
[02:35:00]  We refuse to be responsible.  1-0-2-7.  W. N.E.W.  Fran is 84 years old.  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No, anal is okay.  Trainwrecked Radio.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Oh, man.  Turn Dinicola's mic on.  Dinicola's got offensive.  Hey, Dinicola, get in there.  We're short of mic. 
[02:35:30]  He's got to share one or the other.  Come on.  You share my mic.  So offensive.  You've got to get on mic.  Don't get in here and run away.  Mike Dinicola.  Wait, let's get on.  Mike Dinicola was at Caroline's all weekend.  So if you don't like that song, you can protest him at Caroline's.  Let's tell him how you feel.  Colin Quinn's there, too.  Colin Quinn at Caroline's is Mike Dinicola, the author of Full Blown Ares.  Sarcoma is a word I never knew until it came out of his pen.  I never knew that word.  Come on, Mike.  Well, the reviews are coming in for the song.  Let's go to John.  Hey.  John, what's up?  Hey, this is the Huffalo. 
[02:36:00]  We're cops in Jersey.  Yes.  I was listening to it.  I had to call my lieutenant to call me up the road.  I almost crashed my patrol car.  Full-blown age.  I almost crashed into the back of a bus.  I wrote it, then.  That's hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  It's real funny.  Jay Moore is a sick individual.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Oh, God.  You didn't know you wrote it, Jay.  I wrote it.  You didn't know you were a pedophile.  I'll tell you exactly what lines I wrote, too, if you give me the piece of paper back.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  We're handing the lyrics back over to you.  Everyone claiming responsibility now, like a terrorist bombing, the claims of responsibility  coming in.  Let me take this time to not claim responsibility for any of the lines, all right?  Someone picked up the guitar, and it just rolled right off their fingertips.  Oh, look at you.  I'm a professional.  That's why.  Look, he's even got the song ready.  Don't come over the bridge.  It's such a popular song, and no one wants to claim it.  I'm amazed.  It was not exactly all along the Watchtower.  Get us book a World Records call, though. 
[02:37:00]  It's the most offensive song ever penned.  Down to my target weight, sarcoma has popped out all over my face.  Mike DiNicola.  Is that you?  Mike DiNicola.  The penmanship.  All right.  All right.  Where's yours?  What's your line?  I lost three teeth, is Mike DiNicola, my line, and all my friends.  Oh, that's it?  Looks like I'm...  And then he wrote, his handwriting, looks like I'm nearing the end.  That's Mike DiNicola.  I said, no use telling a lie or even a fib when you lie in bed counting all your rams.  Okay.  See, that's pretty bad. 
[02:37:30]  That was a zinger line, too.  Well, it needed a punch-up.  You can't...  Sarcoma...  People can't laugh when they're breathing in.  I tried to give blood.  They just showed me the door.  I went to stand up, fell on the floor.  It's full-blown AIDS.  Mike DiNicola.  And I wrote, damn that whore, damn that whore.  I kept it heterosexual, even.  Oh, yes.  I kept it a heterosexual AIDS case.  That's good.  DiNicola, he left the studio.  It's good.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's official.  He's outside Caroline's with a rainbow flag. 
[02:38:00]  It's official in case the Grammys are listening.  Full-blown AIDS.  Lyrics by Jay Moore and Mike DiNicola.  Music by Steven Lynch.  Yeah, that's it.  That's fine with me.  I'll take the music.  But you have to write written in 15 seconds.  Maybe there's an award for that.  The most horrible song written in that short amount.  That's why it was so bad.  Because we didn't have time to, like, think it out.  Yeah, yeah.  It'd be really clever.  I played a man dying of AIDS in Playing By Heart.  You did?  And I did a very sensitive job, and I did a good job.  All right.  Let's talk to Danny.  Danny, what's up?  Yeah, try to back it up.  Yeah, you guys think AIDS is an effing joke, man? 
[02:38:30]  It's not funny, man.  Guys having to eat freaking all sorts of medication, man?  Wait, you guys aren't 57th and 7th, right?  No.  I'm going to be waiting outside so I can shake your head.  That was a freaking...  I like it to you, you bastard.  Spaz, you retard.  I got through.  Twice I called.  I scammed you, you Spaz.  Thank you, Danny.  You guys ruled syndication yesterday, man.  All right, bye, Spaz.  Oh, that doesn't even matter, syndication yesterday.  Billy the cop, what's up? 
[02:39:00]  Billy.  La Machine.  Hey, man.  Hey, Billy.  La Machine.  That's La Machine, my buddy.  That's one of the gorillas.  If you're sick, you're the funniest man in the world.  Mike DiNicola wrote it.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, no, I'm still playing it.  That's your name all over it, brother.  How many times have you heard so many people calling up to compliment something they hear  on this show, and everyone goes, was it me?  I don't know.  I read you the lines I wrote.  I wrote, you can't tell a lie, can't tell a, no use telling a fib when you're laying in  bed counting your ribs. 
[02:39:30]  That, that's Jay Moore's number one fan, right?  Jay Moore is genius.  Jay, if they only knew the greatest things you ever did for people, man, if they only knew  the greatest side of you, brother.  All right, Billy.  Thanks, Billy.  Okay, have a safe trip back.  I'll see you in Phoenix.  So, Billy, you're saying even though that song may be insensitive, I act incredibly sensitive  and kindly to others?  It's very philanthropic off the air.  That God ever put on his planet, my brother.  All right, Billy.  All right, I'll see you later.  See you in Phoenix, brother.  La Machine.  Bye-bye.  Hey, Jay. 
[02:40:00]  I've got to tell you, though.  We're doing the road show Thursday, bouquet is a wanton.  Did you hear the shirts that we got made up?  Oh, please tell me.  Is this a good surprise?  We're going to, you've got to give us an address.  We'll send you a couple.  Yeah.  I want the Opie and Anthony Express.  Is that a train?  We got those, too, but we got the map of Hawaii on the front.  Opie and Anthony, WNW.  That's unbelievable.  No explanation for the map whatsoever.  No explanation.  But is it an accurate map?  Accurate map.  We had to write Hawaii really small just so people...  Hawaiian Islands.  Just says Hawaiian Islands, like on any map that you say. 
[02:40:30]  No, we should have had, like, you know, which islands, which.  Yeah, I wanted to have, like, all the islands.  Yeah.  No, just saying Hawaii kind of, you know, puts it all together.  I hope you didn't forget Kauai.  All right.  You always got to squeeze out Hawaii.  Hawaii always ends up coming out.  It goes out at Mulcahy's Thursday for the show.  That is awesome.  Doors open at 7 and we'll be there at 8.  Who do I have to make a call to to get you guys indicated?  Who's your buddy Hackett to make a call?  I don't understand why those guys aren't nationwide.  You're really funny.  I'm in trouble staying out of trouble in New York.  Do you have a sheep in the car? 
[02:41:00]  Do we want to talk to everyone that's pissed off about the song?  Yes.  Wait, let me just say something here.  Rick is over here trying to write the second verse.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  If Rick's trying to write it.  As if there were a remote chance that it was going to get played.  If Rick's going to write it, it's really bad.  Psycho Mark will have it.  Rick is probably the most offensive person on this show.  What do you write, Jay?  Isn't he horrible?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. 
[02:41:30]  No, let me see.  But it's got like a Gimme Shelter vibe to it.  It's like it's a short...  Because my lyrics and Mike's lyrics are longer.  Yeah.  Like longer sentences.  His are like clipped.  Like Gimme Shelter.  Oh, Mike.  Well, I...  Read it.  Read it.  I'm not reading that.  Rick, once again, completely over the top.  Like when he took my picture with the who...  The strippers.  It's totally not...  It's not even the least bit subtle.  Oh, my God.  Like that last one was so in your face.  I can't even read it.  The first verse.  This one, like, so bad. 
[02:42:00]  But at least the last one ended with damn that whore.  Like, you know...  At least there was some comedic...  There was a...  No, there was a reason to it.  Almost a message.  Yeah.  It was like damn that whore.  Don't have sex with an intravenous...  A message.  ...prostitute.  You can look at it as like a PSA.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Let's take the hate calls.  Well, we got the Rainbow Coalition on line 11.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Hi, Scott.  Actually, I'm not from the Rainbow Coalition.  I got through SPAZ, so...  Did he ask you, what's the Rainbow Coalition? 
[02:42:30]  There's a leper...  There's a leperton on the line from the Rainbow Coalition?  There's a...  There's a SPAZ.  There's a unicorn on three.  Hey, Jay.  Yes, sir.  I got a question for you.  Virgo.  Hey, Jay.  Yeah.  Yes, go ahead.  I got a question for you.  You said that.  You got a mohawk or a...  Or you got a triangle?  I'm, like, all over the place.  I just shave it so I don't pull my hair when I masturbate.  Yeah, you redeemed yourself.  I thought you were a real pussy there for a minute, and you weren't going to own up to 
[02:43:00]  writing the song.  No, I wrote...  I read exactly what I wrote.  Writing the song.  He does.  I wrote Counting My Ribs.  Hey, you should be...  I was at your show with Rascals the other day when O&A wouldn't come up to the stage.  Yeah.  A couple pussies there.  No, we came up the second show.  Yeah, the first...  Oh, the second show.  Oh, thanks.  So the boos didn't kick in.  Yeah, we had a few more buds.  He didn't do some good age.  Oh, so we should have booed you then.  Wow.  Or give us more Budweiser.  We would have been on the stage.  Oh, okay.  Lickety-split.  No, the beer kicked in for the second show. 
[02:43:30]  We got to loosen up a little bit, yeah.  All right, Scott.  We got to let you fly.  Syndication now.  All right, man.  Syndication.  Bye-bye.  Look at Rick whispering.  I got an idea for you.  Oh, my God.  All I got to say to people, if you thought that was offensive, what Rick wrote, I can give you buzzwords.  All right.  Let me see that lyric sheet, Rick.  Rick writing the song.  Rick, the guy that...  I'm not done.  I'm not done.  The guy that penned Latin baseball during baseball season, which was probably the single most offensive song ever played. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  It starts out, all right.  Intravenous feedings every day.  The AIDS football.  God, please help me.  I'm fading away.  I don't know why.  Sounds like Metallica, doesn't it?  I don't know why.  Yeah.  See, mine was a heterosexual.  Our version was heterosexual because we're damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  Yeah.  Well, a guy could be the whore.  Right.  Damn that little whore.  That's you thinking of that.  I don't know why.  Yeah, sure.  And then this is Rick.  What's your last name, Rick? 
[02:44:30]  I'm not telling you.  All right.  Rick, who is uncircumcised, by the way.  We asked him if he was circumcised, and he goes, no comment, remember?  No comment.  And I go, that means egg roll.  No comment is directly transplated into a...  Yes.  I don't know why.  Hey!  That's Marko.  Is that Marko?  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Y-M-C-A.  Macho!  Macho!  Hey!  Hey!  I can't even read this.  I don't know why.  Can I read this?  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[02:45:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  It sounded like pay.  Keep hitting it.  It sounded like you're saying pay for that ass.  All right.  Hold on.  It goes from hey to pay.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  All right.  Anthony, read the last verse.  You're the sickest one here.  No, I'm not going to read that.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  Let Rick read it.  Yeah, Rick!  He wrote it.  Let Rick read it.  Rick will read anything.  Come on.  Someone has to read it.  I'm not going to read it.  You read it. 
[02:45:30]  We got cops in Jersey on our side.  We'll get Rick.  I'm going on an MD-80.  Someone's going to bomb my plane.  MD-80, don't worry about those tail hydraulics.  I'm sure they all took care of that.  You mean the line that says, now blood and pus is all eye cream?  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Now, look.  I'm on this mic here.  I moaned at the same time so there could be no confusion as to it wasn't the game.  Right.  Rick, man.  What's the line before that?  Why did I dump that, please?  Jesus, man.  That's got to get dumped.  Come on.  That's just bad. 
[02:46:00]  You know, you brought everybody down.  DeNicola left.  DeNicola's canceling Caroline right now.  He's like, maybe I can get the governors.  Maybe I'll emcee.  Strawberry, what?  Is this true?  What?  Hold on.  Strawberry failed another drug test?  No way.  Kenny.  You.  Is this true?  Yes, it is.  I was just watching Channel 2 News, guys.  Somebody else calling in with it.  I'm going to give you a little what I learned early today.  Strawberry tested positive for cocaine again?  He did.  What is with that guy? 
[02:46:30]  Who knows?  He's done.  I got two words.  Ricky Lede.  Screw you guys.  That's what I call for.  I'll talk to you later.  Thanks for the update.  Wasn't he going for Howe's record?  He's so done.  The coke machine.  Bro, he goes in the coke machine.  The coke machine.  The coke machine.  How many times did he test?  Like eight?  Nine?  I think that's four now.  He's halfway.  No, I mean, but Howe was like nine?  Howe's seven.  Seven.  Or eight.  Seven or eight.  So what do you think Steinbrenner is going to stand behind him this time?  Or that's it?  I have a theory like this.  And it boils down to the John Rocker. 
[02:47:00]  John Rocker's thing did not get reduced, correct?  Correct.  Right.  Bud Selig knows he'll never win salary arbitration and they need revenue sharing in baseball.  Right.  It's such a strong union.  He'll never cave into that.  Uh-huh.  Like football, the Green Bay Packers, there's like six people in freaking Green Bay.  And they can afford like Reggie White and Brett Favre.  But baseball, the Royals are always going to suck.  Everyone that's a small town is always going to suck.  So anyway, so he knows he's not going to win revenue sharing or salary cap.  So anytime anything like this happens, he's going to shove it so far up the rest.  Like Rocker, he was like 30 days a lot for saying queers with AIDS while we're on the subject. 
[02:47:30]  I think John Rocker wrote that song.  That's right.  That was it.  Penned by John Rocker.  Oh, Dina Cola.  He's back out of the studio.  He liked Dina Cola at Rascals.  He will be performing full-blown in before he introduces Colin Quinn.  Dina Cola, you can run, but you can't hide.  I'm giving out your phone number over the air.  Hey, Peter, what else you got on Strawberry?  That's all I got.  I just figured I'd give you the heads up.  How'd you like the song?  All right.  Did you hear that song?  That song's brutal, man.  Yeah, it was brutal. 
[02:48:00]  Well, so is full-blown AIDS.  It's very brutal.  Yes, it was a message.  I don't want to get that again.  Damn that whore.  All right, Peter.  Damn that whore.  Anthony, when you come to Bay Ridge, you know, we're patrolling around here.  You better not have Massachusetts place because we're going to have to find you eventually.  Ah, come on.  Come on.  I'm a good guy.  If they don't carry?  You got it.  What's that?  Every listener carries a piece.  This guy's a cop.  Every listener's a cop.  Yeah.  The cops love us.  We support the cops in this damn town.  Peter, thank you.  Hey, when I come back in the summer, it's going to be Opie and Anthony, Stephen Lynch, and Jay Moore to be continued. 
[02:48:30]  We're working it out right now.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Hell, yeah.  If we're still around.  No, you'll be around.  You'll be around, and we'll do, like, we'll just stay there until they kick us out.  We'll do, like, a week straight.  We'll see my sellout streaks.  We'll go for the Allman Brothers record.  That's right.  We'll do, like, 30 dates.  I think we should.  We'll just set up a couch on the stage or something.  I'll take a month off.  Set up a couch on stage.  We'll have Lynch come out.  Dina Colo will sing full-blown eggs.  Lynch will come out and go, what do you want me to sing?  What do you want me to sing? 
[02:49:00]  What do you want me to sing?  What?  I don't know.  What do you want me to sing?  I did that one already.  I write four songs, and I do them all twice every time I come out.  Oh, my God.  Hey, that's how it is.  Hey, look.  He hasn't heard half of the song, so you can hear.  Well, neither is the audience.  Joseph.  Hello?  Yeah, Joseph.  You guys are just asses.  Okay.  Come on.  Yes.  Making a friend of gay.  Have you ever seen a man die of AIDS?  Yes, I did.  I did extensive research when I did Plank My Heart.  What the hell is so funny singing your song, Jack?  Because you're gay anyway. 
[02:49:30]  Bullseye on men's asses.  First of all, you sound like Joanne Worley.  Yeah.  Second of all, I didn't sing the song.  Third of all...  Who sung it then?  This guy is for real.  Stephen Lynch.  That's funny, right?  Stephen Lynch sang it.  Wait, Joseph, is that your real voice, or are you trying to listen?  This guy's not for real.  He's not.  Joseph.  Hello?  Stephen Lynch sang the song.  I don't think he's for real, though.  Who's not for real, bitch?  Yeah.  Okay.  Baba Booey.  Baba who?  Bob on this, bitch.  Come on.  Give us your real voice. 
[02:50:00]  There's no real voice.  Here's his real voice.  All right.  That's your real voice.  The one potato, two potato down the village, bitch.  All right, Stephen.  I'm the one that's not making fun of you.  This is Jay Mort.  What is your primary anger here?  Because it's not funny.  It's awful.  Yes.  It is awful.  You all need to go to an AIDS clinic and see someone dying and deteriorating of AIDS.  I worked for a month at AIDS Project Los Angeles when I prepared for my role,  and I visited many, many, many, many sick people.  Do you want to be ashamed of yourself for even being part of it?  Part of it? 
[02:50:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Anyway.  Joke.  Yeah, that's me, Joseph.  You're a bitch anyway.  Yeah, that's me.  I'll come down there and bitch smack you.  No, I don't think so.  Yeah.  I've seen you staggering around the village a couple of times.  Yeah, sure you have.  Shaking through the park a lot, walking on a cloud like a little bitch.  Yeah, sure you have.  How do you recognize guys from the radio?  I know.  What are you, a martian?  I've seen them on the website.  That was Jay Mort.  I left a map of Miami on the screen.  All right.  Thank you, Joseph. 
[02:51:00]  What's that noise?  Joseph?  Is there a train?  All right, bye.  You got a jump track.  He jumped off the track.  I never saw anybody escape the train.  I know.  It's very hard to escape the train.  At least you said it.  At least you said the catchphrase.  Yeah, really?  O.P. and Anthony, you're looking for a catchphrase.  We have a dopey catchphrase.  Is that a train?  What is Nicky?  Chick wants O&A to play what CD?  She's got a CD.  What?  Is she in there?  She's got a single called Full Blown Edge. 
[02:51:30]  I'm naming plagiarism.  All right, we got to take a break.  No, not on the words.  And the music, she's playing pictures.  I'll grab them and get sued.  Like, Kill a Cat is 867-5309, really.  And then he thinks he bails out of it at the end by singing it.  Like, hey, see everybody?  I know what they do.  Tommy Teuton's in the village with a needle hanging out of his arm going,  I had the number one song.  What happened?  I can't believe he refused to sing Special Olympics when he played that one today. 
[02:52:00]  You played full-blown eight.  Hey, the only reason I did that is because it's not my song.  That's it.  Hey, we're not taking the heat for it.  My friend, it's on mine.  It's all on tape, my friend.  All right.  That's all right.  It'll be on the best of.  We got to take a break.  I want to hear Special Olympics.  And we got to say goodbye to Jay next, I guess.  Well, I write three lines of an eight song.  Are you kicking me out?  Kicked out.  My flight's in the morning.  Can we play the Special Olympics on CD?  Sure.  Stephen's saying no. 
[02:52:30]  Instead of live?  Yeah.  If I can't play it live.  I need a capo for that song.  Get ball.  All right.  We'll be back.  I need a capo.  We'll be back.  Stephen Lynch says he has a nice song for us because he was listening to Corky Steinbrenner  a little while ago.  I want a corn dog.  This just reminded me of a song.  All right.  Special Olympics.  It was a little something like this.  Corky?  I got it.  Watch them run. 
[02:53:00]  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Oh, boy.  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's diving.  At the Special Olympics. 
[02:53:30]  You're searching, Penny.  And I know full well that I will burn in hell.  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball got to be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life.  At the Special Olympics.  Special Olympics. 
[02:54:00]  Take it, Corky.  And I'll pay.  Say the Olympics.  Oh, yes, I'll sing, Penny.  You can sing at my wedding when I get married.  Oh, my God.  John.  Oh, ho.  That's right.  Unemployment line.  Here we come.  Hello?  I thought I'd object a little intelligence to this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Hopi and Anthony.  More stupidity.  On the way. 
[02:54:30]  1027 WNEW.  Stack or two.  The world's strongest fat burger.  Yes.  Aside from full-blown AIDS.  The best way to lose weight.  Stack or two.  What?  What?  What?  I thought we were all having fun.  What?  What, Jay?  We were talking about strawberry.  Yeah.  I think it's a drug test.  Yeah.  Okay.  I said, every time something really bad goes wrong with the Yankees, they do really well.  And Hopi said, yeah, now someone's going to get cancer.  Oh.  And as soon as Hopi said it, Dina Cola grabbed the pen and went, that's a good one. 
[02:55:00]  Look at him right now.  He just wrote, look, he's writing.  Mike Dina Cola, Caroline's Comedy Club.  Holy smoke.  Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burger.  Who's the guy you don't recognize?  There's a woman that used Stack or two, Anthony.  Yes.  Lost a hundred pounds.  Come on.  Come on.  Using Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burger.  Hit it with a U-lock.  It does three things.  It burns the fat.  Mm-hmm.  Crushes the cravings to snack in between meals.  Are you talking about fat maker?  And it gives you a boost of energy.  No.  Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, Stack or two's better than that.  Absolutely is, Jay.  Yeah.  You can visit them on their website, www.stack or two.com.  You know who lost a lot of weight on Pat Stacker?  What?  The guy who shot.  All right, listen.  Or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Start now and look great this spring with Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner.  1-800-LIGHT-LINE or stack or two.com on the Internet.  Stack or two, the world's strongest fat burner. 
[02:56:00]  Thousands have proven it works.  Hey!  Hey!  Train, Craig, and Rick.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  All right, we only have a few minutes left in this train wreck we call a radio show.  Yeah, fun today.  Got to thank Stephen Lynch for coming in today.  Hey, thank you.  He'll be at our road show this Thursday at Mulcahy's and Wontalk. 
[02:56:30]  I'll be there in spirit.  Jay Moore will not be there, blowing us off.  Thanks, Jay.  Oh, come on!  Screw the movie.  What's more important, a movie or your pals Opie and Anthony?  You guys are, actually.  I could retire on my rascal's money.  What kind of part is this now, movie?  Good, juicy part?  With full blown eights?  Come on!  That's what I...  Hey, you know, I was reading the website.  Instant feedback, yeah.  Yeah, instant feedback.  And a lot of people are complaining that it's not 18 and over. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  And my message to them is, sneak in.  What are you, retarded?  That's what we say.  Yeah, sneak in.  Get a fake ID.  Get the doorman 20 bucks.  It's the computer age.  Yeah, sneak in or whatever.  I'll print your own IDs these days.  Bobby!  I'll almost print your own cash.  Bobby!  Open in!  What's up?  What's going on?  You got a question for Jay?  Jay.  Yeah.  I'm going to Vegas.  Six in the morning.  Where are you going to be at?  Why?  Come on, buddy.  Let's hang out.  He liked your technique. 
[02:57:30]  I'll actually be at a wardrobe fitting that I don't know...  Oh, you're not doing any shows over there?  No, no.  I'm doing a movie.  Oh, that's no fun.  With Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt and the little kid, Haley Joel Osmond from Sixth Sense.  He's going back to his real life.  This was just a little detour.  This is my day job.  No, man.  This is the best.  Yeah, so you're going to do afternoon driving?  Am I going to do it?  Yeah, come on.  I might have to because these guys are going to mornings.  All right.  Take care, Dreamweaver.  All right, Bobby.  Dreamweaver.  10-4.  Okay. 
[02:58:00]  Every day.  Every day.  We can't get through a show without one idiot.  Kathleen.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Kathleen.  What's up?  Hi, Jay.  How you doing?  Who is Dreamweaver?  Dreamweaver was some big fat girl that...  Hold on, Kathleen.  Yeah, sure.  I went to take horseback riding.  I met her on the CB out in California.  You've never heard this story?  Oh, it's classic.  I met her on the CB, Dreamweaver.  All I kept hearing was like the song Dreamweaver.  And you thought she was like a real hot piece of ass?  Yeah.  So I get my horse and I get another horse, pack it up. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, I'm like paw angles.  You're packing her.  Yeah.  I swear.  I pull up with the horse, like in tow.  The horse that she was going to get on looked at me pissed.  I swear to God.  She was pretty huge.  She rode the lawnmower around college.  Hi, Kathleen.  All right.  Let's go back to Kathleen.  She was Dreamweaver.  I was the Wrangler.  Hi, Kathleen.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  Oh, my God.  That was embarrassing. 
[02:59:00]  What?  Go ahead, Kathleen.  I just wanted to play what I learned today on the O.P. Anthony show.  Sure.  I learned that if you give Stephen Lynch enough Jager mice, that he'll say acid flashback  to medicinal.  You could almost hear the big train brake lever.  I know.  I'm waiting for you.  Sparks are shooting out of the wheels.  I didn't understand what you said.  I didn't either.  I said, uh...  Hey.  Never mind.  Hey.  I can't train wreck me anyway. 
[02:59:30]  We wouldn't dream of train wreck.  Oh, no.  Christopher Reeve just fell on her.  I've never heard that dead silence like that.  There's this many guys in here.  I know.  Amazing.  Like, she just shut everyone up.  I haven't heard silence like that since Dina Kohler's last time at Caroline.  Well, he'll get quite the ovation during the performance of Full Blown Ace. 
[03:00:00]  I tell you, Mike, you once day, anybody who listens to O.P. and Anthony, and they're going  to scream like lunatics, and you say, I wrote Full Blown Ace, and they're going to...  I'm not even joking.  I just did 20...  We're at 23 now, consecutive sellouts, and every show, O.P. and Anthony!  I'm in Miami, they're yelling at me.  People on vacation.  Anita.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  You've got to make it fast.  What's up?  Okay.  I learned since you guys are going to go in the morning, now we have to listen to Wolf  and Dorcas, and you guys, the past four weeks, great radio. 
[03:00:30]  Great.  I loved it.  The chicks love it.  Thank you.  Love it.  Thank you.  You guys are awesome.  Rock on, syndication last week.  All right.  All right?  Make sure you practice safe sex.  Thanks for being here.  If I'm practicing.  Bye.  Bye.  I'll be right over.  Well, we know Anthony doesn't have high standards.  He's screwing Dream Waver the horse.  Dream Waver.  That was back, way back when.  Come on.  That was when I was in California.  Did you hit it?  To be honest.  Hell no.  Oh, shut up!  You saw it right on the horse.  Jank, swear to God, she got on the horse. 
[03:01:00]  We rode around.  I had this horse, both horses packed.  It was like the little rascals, like that swayback horse.  But I had the horses packed out for a full night of camping.  Like I was going to bring her up with saddlebags, like a little house on the prairie.  I mean, I was going to hunt for her.  Jank, thank you all.  Bringing back the memories.  She lost 2,000 pounds on fat tracks.  And like after an hour of riding around, I just said, oh, look at the time.  Got to go. 
[03:01:30]  The horse that she was on was like foaming, like it just won the Belmont Stakes.  I figured I was going to hunt for her and stuff.  I had a gun and everything.  I was going to shoot like a rabbit and feed her.  Then I realized that I'd have to beg a moose.  You're dead injured?  I was ready to, yeah, I was ready to do some hunting.  You know?  Is that Stephen Lynch?  Down there, Stephen Lynch.  Listen.  Waiting for full-blown eggs.  Watch it more.  Am I going to come?  You got the order back. 
[03:02:00]  I can't take away my water.  No, I didn't.  Why did I even pay for the horses?  It was my own horse.  Like I used to have horses.  What?  Out in California.  Oh, is it a question?  My dream weaver.  Yeah.  Dream weaver, this is the Wrangler.  You got your ears on?  You're still set?  You got your ears and your stomach on, don't you?  That big ass.  I can put my hands in my pockets when I'm naked. 
[03:02:30]  She's fat, I tell you.  Poor thing.  Is that her or the horse?  I need an update.  I would love to get in touch with Dreamweaver now, but I don't even know her name.  Have her on the show.  When do you get on your little ham radio?  Dreamweaver?  Dreamweaver.  Oh, Wrangler, I've been waiting for you.  20 years.  What are you, 60? 
[03:03:00]  20 years?  No, it was like 20 years ago.  I was a kid.  I was like 13.  It was quite...  No, I was like 15.  You're driving an 18-wheeler?  No, it was...  It was a desert.  No, it was a CB radio, like in the house.  It was in the house.  There's no cool way to...  No, believe me, I know.  Don't worry about it.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Mikey?  Yo.  You're on the air, let's go. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, I just want to tell you guys, I learned today that you guys are devoid of all class,  morals, and common decency, just what you want on a radio show.  Yes.  All right, thank you, Mike.  Thanks, guys.  Peace.  I think we have to leave.  We didn't write it.  You played it.  Clear the field.  Come on.  Yeah, we got to leave.  I got to do a show.  Yeah.  Tubby Tom's coming in?  Tubby Tom like it.  He only has a few left.  We should let him start on time.  I conquered New York.  What?  Hey, Stephen Lynch, you got any other songs for us? 
[03:04:00]  Psycho Mark's like writing down lines for the cancer song.  Why are there racial slurs in it?  Smoke.  With racial slurs in it.  Oh, no.  No, why?  Because he's from Southie.  Oh, where is he?  He's in New York.  He's in New York.  Is he?  Tom's in New York?  Oh, what is that?  Tom, ah!  Bring Tom by.  He used to, like, broadcast from the next studio.  Yeah, when he was in New York.  We trashed him so much, now he's scared of us.  He goes to the Westwood One Studios.  I go to the Westwood One Studios.  Now, guaranteed, he'll get on and start ragging about us. 
[03:04:30]  But, Tom, we're still going to be here.  Have fun.  Who won that battle, Mr.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  What helps when you have a high-powered act like Stephen Lynch and Bobby Slayton?  Hey, wait a minute.  I'm being completely serious.  Oh, my God.  That was a complete...  Wow.  You are so bad.  I'm full blown-aids.  That's not very nice.  I was being completely serious.  That's been so serious.  Slayton this morning was very funny.  This morning, what time did you get up?  Thanks, pal. 
[03:05:00]  Thanks, pal, Jay, my friend.  Can you believe the way Jay's just lambasted you at all?  He's pissed because $191 barbells.  Barbells.  How do they round it to $191?  Glenn Fittich, all their quarters add up.  You've got to refill those bottles and put them back in the...  You know you drink a lot when you have to switch beers twice.  You went from Bud to Heineken to Sam Adams.  He's like, I guess I'm on Sam now.  Jay, in Stephen's defense, I know you don't drink, but Jesus Christ, not everything comes in a pill.  You know? 
[03:05:30]  Come on.  Okay?  Sometimes you've got to crack a bottle or a can or something.  I'm jealous.  I know.  I did it too well.  I just don't.  He drinks.  He drinks the NyQuil.  NyQuil.  That stuff's kick-ass.  I know.  That's why I wake up at 2.  I don't know if it's the bed or the NyQuil.  I got a new bed.  I thought it was the bed, and then, you know, it might be the NyQuil.  And the Klonopin.  You're mixing that stuff?  They better not find you like Farley, man.  You'd be in your Rockaway bed covered in vomit.  No.  God. 
[03:06:00]  Well, come on.  Well, why not?  They'll come and they'll clean it up.  We could take away, they'll take away Jay Moore.  If I die in your bed, they'll come and they'll clean it up.  Imagine now you call a Rockaway bed and tell them all the way a dead body in your bed.  Jay Moore died in my bed.  I want a new bed.  It's about the foamy green NyQuil.  They'll do it.  They'll do it.  They'll do it.  They'll do it.  They'll do it.  They'll do it.  He took a few too many.  It looks like he coughed up a watercolor set.  I think it's when he tried to gargle with the Listerine. 
[03:06:30]  Wow.  All right.  We've got to wrap this up.  Yeah.  We've got to get out of here.  I want to thank you guys for helping me sell out those shows, Jay, any time.  And when you get back in New York, you've got to come in.  Yeah, we've got to play the second round of What's in Your Pants.  Well, just make sure Rick gets a hold of me.  How long are you going to be filming for, Mr. Moore?  Twelve weeks.  Wow.  Keep us updated on Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt and stuff.  Let us know any fun stories from the set.  I'll get the little kid on the show and all that.  Yeah, do that. 
[03:07:00]  That could be cool.  I want to hear him say, I see dead people.  That's his big line.  You know what you wanted to say?  Yeah, I wanted to say it on the phone.  You're listening to old me and Anthony, I see dead people.  Yeah, that's our goal.  That's all we need the kid to say.  Hey, you know what?  I don't promise many things.  Yeah.  You'll get it.  All right.  I don't doubt it.  Did I deliver Hackett?  Hell yeah.  How many whores in the last two months have been in this room?  Well, we could do that ourselves.  Yeah, but that's not that hard.  Anthony, the other day he goes...  I'm more impressed with the buddy Hackett, trust me.  Anthony goes, relax, you're strippers.  And I go, yeah, for free. 
[03:07:30]  If you're munching on each other, no one's...  You didn't dump that.  No, I'm sorry.  I just ain't hitting buttons.  No, it's way over here, I swear.  No, I would never deny the pimp hand.  All right.  Absolutely.  That's what I learned today.  You know what I learned today?  Opie and Anthony's the best damn radio show in the entire country.  All right.  See you more.  Okay, have a safe flight, okay?  Back to his Hollywood life.  Thank you very much.  And Lynch, we'll see you Thursday at the Roadshow.  Okay, he's in Watton.  See you there.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow, too.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:08:00]  It's a Kevlar kind of day.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
