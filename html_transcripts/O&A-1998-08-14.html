<pre> 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, the Dave Matthews Band Day.  I want backup singers for our show, just to stand in the background and go...  That would be pretty cool.  Yeah, set up three mics and have them dancing.  You want backup singers and we can't even get anyone to work on our show.  Who are you kidding?  That would be great after we just say something, hey, NEW. 
[00:30]
 Saturday night, beginning at 10pm, NEW presents the Dave Matthews Band in concert from the  10 spot.  That's something to look forward to this weekend.  Hey, our listeners are starting to figure it out here.  What?  Wow, look at that.  All 12 phone lines ringing at one time right now.  Nice.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  We first started coming around the NEW studios.  Hello?  Hello?  Is anyone out there?  Yeah, we had to sit in the studio so we could learn this whole system and we looked at the 
[01:00]
 phone lines.  Is that broke?  Yeah, one person called in four hours.  Now we got all 12 lines ringing before we even gave out the phone number.  That's a good sign here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you, Jesus.  We also got to say hi to Jackie, Steph and Laura, the multi-generational group.  First Facts of the Day, 212957 W&W is the Facts Line.  You see what's going on at Times Square today? 
[01:30]
 I just saw a crowd.  What are they doing down there today?  Yeah, Sonny and Cher auditions for the Sonny and Cher TV movie.  That great thing they're putting together.  That's going to be another bomb.  What a freak show.  Yeah.  These people come out.  I guess they're all pumped up that they might have a shot.  Yeah.  Some of these girls, old ladies that came out to meet Cher.  Oh my God.  They could have been like the Wicked Witch. 
[02:00]
 Really?  Had the long hair and that was about it.  They got the Paula Jones nose work and they look like Cher.  Yeah.  And then Sonny, one guy, he looked like Sonny after he hit the tree.  I swear to God.  If you're going to do a movie about Sonny and Cher and you hear that there's going to  be these auditions, don't show up if you look like the old Sonny and Cher.  I think they want the young Sonny and Cher.  Yeah.  We'll age you.  The people in charge of the movie, they'll age you.  They'll age you over the years.  With makeup.  Sure. 
[02:30]
 It's pretty impossible to turn a 60-year-old guy going, I got you, babe, into the young  Sonny of the 60s and 70s.  It was that bad, huh?  It was horrible.  The one guy that I saw was wearing this big furry outfit like Sonny used to wear the caveman  outfit.  Sure.  And one guy looked like a bum they just pulled off the street.  I swear to God.  I don't even think he was trying to audition.  They just, like a news crew was down there, shoved a mic in his face.  You're trying to audition to be Sonny?  Do you have some change?  We should go down there and audition. 
[03:00]
 Oh, yeah.  Why not?  We have a better shot than anyone else.  Who would you be?  I'll be Cher.  You got that right.  You got me.  I didn't say anything.  Well, what were you going to do then?  There was only two choices.  No, I'm going to be Chastity.  Yeah, you can do that.  Yeah, I can do that.  Speaking of Chastity, later on we've got to talk about this revelation in the paper.  Eleanor Roosevelt.  Yeah?  Lesbian.  Oh, yeah.  Lesbian.  Don't you read the history books?  It wasn't in the history books. 
[03:30]
 No?  No.  Well, they got letters or something to prove that she was a lesbian.  Yeah, there's a bunch of letters.  Did you ever see a picture of her?  No.  Did you ever see a picture of her?  What?  Oh, yeah.  It's just, I don't know, you just never think, you know, Eleanor Roosevelt was doing that.  No?  No.  Okay.  We'll get into that a little bit later.  All right.  And we got the instant feedback set up and ready to go.  Between 3 and 7 you can go to the WNYW website and click on the instant feedback that sends  your emails right into the studio so we can read them.  We have a lot of good stuff here.  between three and seven you could go to the WNW website and click on the instant feedback 
[04:00]
 that sends your emails right into the studio so we can read them immediately especially  if you got something that we're talking about.  A little angle on it alright.  On the way we got Van Halen who's coming to the beach tomorrow night.  We'll do some Van Halen with David Lee Roth and Green Day is next.  Stay there.  Hey let's say hi to the ladies at Nielsen and a fax from Roland coming in.  It says Dear Anus and Mandy, you guys rule but who will take over the show when you go  back to the sixth grade after summer vacation. 
[04:30]
 Very nice.  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW where Rock lives Van Halen and Kenny Wayne Shepard playing the beach tomorrow night  and the PNC Arts Center on Sunday.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Rick is sending me a fax here.  Get those two idiots off the air, Opie and Anthony.  Ha ha.  They suck.  Ha ha.  Oh ouch that hurts.  Still here.  Ha ha.  Oh that one hurt.  Boy I don't think I can go on with the show now. 
[05:00]
 Yeah.  Ouch that hurts.  Let's cash it in.  Ha ha.  Hey we got a ton of email overnight about the road rage thing we did yesterday.  I want to play it one last time before we put it in the archives for a while.  Call it what you want.  It's not road rage.  I don't think it really was road rage.  Basically it's a look into our commute into the radio station actually.  Me and Anthony taped the last five blocks of the ride in.  Anthony was driving.  He didn't know I was taping.  So in between him cursing out all the other drivers on the road we were making comments 
[05:30]
 about all the people we saw on the sidewalks.  The only people that don't curse at drivers are the people that are being cursed at.  That's it.  Plain and simple.  And that's all I was doing.  Okay.  But I think the comments between the curses is just as enjoyable to listen to as well.  So yeah you got to do something while you're driving so you look at the people and you  comment.  There you go.  The first comment that you'll hear on this little tape live from Anthony's car is when  we drove by a correctional facility.  Check this out.  Check out all the kids going to see daddy. 
[06:00]
 You're rocking out a Friday afternoon with Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW where rock lives.  Can you just imagine that old broad mounting that old broad?  That is...  Whoa, whoa.  1027 WNEW the rock of New York.  That's the latest from days of the new.  And the downtown...  Who turned around the mic?  It's Opie and Anthony.  I guess a lot of people have seen the story in the post today.  This is a huge story if you ask me.  Mrs. FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, lesbian love letters exposed. 
[06:30]
 Heed me words.  To an ex-reporter.  They found all these passionate love letters between Eleanor Roosevelt and this reporter,  Lorena Hickox.  You said Hick.  Well, oddly enough, Eleanor in the letters always called her Hick.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess that the second part of the name was... 
[07:00]
 I don't even say it.  It's something she couldn't swallow.  All right.  You know, Eleanor's lover there?  Yeah.  She looks like George Washington.  Well, look at Eleanor.  She looks like Jimmy Carter.  Doesn't she?  She looks like Jimmy Carter with a wig and her lover looks like George Washington.  Oh, and they're doing the nasty bumping walkers.  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  Just think, during the height of World War II, FDR's carpet bombing Berlin and she's carpet  munching in Washington. 
[07:30]
 Come on.  What?  FDR was in a wheelchair before the days of Viagra.  Probably all frustrated.  And there's Eleanor.  All found a little jaunt.  Yeah.  Here's some excerpts.  Okay, go ahead.  My pictures are nearly all up and I have left you in my sitting room where I could look  at you most of my waking hours.  I can't kiss you, so I kiss your picture good night and good morning.  My dear, if you meet me, may I forget that there are any other reporters present or must 
[08:00]
 I behave?  I shall want to hug you to death.  I can hardly wait.  You see this one?  Most clearly, I remember your eyes with a kind of teasing smile in them and that feeling  of that soft spot just northeast of the corner of your mouth against my lips.  Wow.  Oh, geriatric lesbian love going on there.  Who knew?  Who knew?  Come on. 
[08:30]
 A little bit of scandal there.  Yeah.  Where did these letters come from, though?  I never even heard that rumor.  It's going to be in a new book?  Oh, these are in George Magazine this month.  Oh.  It's going to be in a new book, more of these letters.  It's just from the late 20s to the mid-30s, I guess.  Right.  And later, actually.  Yeah.  She was having a lesbian affair with this reporter.  Yeah, that's just great.  I didn't think there was lesbianism back then.  Well, they really had to keep it secret.  That was right after, you know, because that was a whole time, you know, you didn't think 
[09:00]
 about it.  Right.  They were still using terms like gay was fun.  Remember that in the Flintstones song?  We'll have a gay old time.  That word sure changed, huh?  Sure has.  Sure has.  Used to mean happy.  Not anymore.  No.  It means something totally different.  All right, 212-757-1027, if you've got something to add to the program today, the factions are 
[09:30]
 coming in like crazy.  We'll put your name on the air.  Give us a fax.  212-957-WNEW.  We got the talking heads and Harvey Danger next.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York with the verb.  It's Opie and Anthony after the show tonight.  Don't forget the Giants take on the Jacksonville Jaguars at 7.05.  We'll get going right here on NEW.  Do you want to take a complaint call?  All right.  Well, aren't you, you know, a radio personality and you're also upper management here at NEW? 
[10:00]
 Yes.  Okay.  I'll take that deal.  All right.  So handle this complaint call for us.  All right.  NEW complaints.  Yeah.  Hi.  I want to complain about these two idiots you have there in drive time.  I've been listening to the station since the day it came on the air.  I want to work with you, sir.  What seems to be your problem with these gentlemen?  They just had a woman on the phone who called us to complain about foul language and they're  telling her, and they're telling her, don't worry, you'll keep listening and we'll keep  pissing you off.  What kind of, what is that?  And you don't think that's right for them to put on somebody that wants to voice a legitimate 
[10:30]
 complaint.  To put them on the air.  To put them on the air like that.  Woman that calls to complain about, about language.  You feel it degrades them.  You feel it degrades the caller and makes them seem stupid.  It absolutely does.  And not only that, I mean, forgetting for a minute about the...  Right.  Yes.  Continue, sir.  This station has gone downhill.  That's it.  Could you tell me what you think of Opie and Anthony?  They're stupid.  Suck.  What a joke.  Could you tell me what you think of Opie and Anthony? 
[11:00]
 They're stupid.  Suck.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from 7 Marry 3.  That's over your shoulder.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Heading toward quitting time and if you're looking for something to do tonight, tonight  is WNEW night at Rye Playland.  Will we be on hand at this event?  Hell no.  I don't think we'll be there.  Sorry.  No.  I don't think it's safe to leave the NEW studios yet.  No, no, not yet.  I'm hoping eventually it'll be safe enough to go out there and meet some listeners of  NEW. 
[11:30]
 We can bask in the light of day.  But with the phone calls we're getting today, no, it's definitely not time yet to get out  there and shake some hands and stuff and drink beers with you guys.  It goes in phases.  Yeah, it does.  Today we're having a real bitchy day.  And people are just calling and complaining.  Yeah, they've had it with us.  But if you're heading to Rye Playland tonight, Ken Dashow is going to be there from 8 to  10 tonight.  He's got complimentary samples from Ben and Jerry's and plenty of WNEW giveaways.  Speaking of complaints, what do you got on the answer feedback? 
[12:00]
 Anything?  Say hi to Melissa in New Jersey.  She loves us.  Oh, Melissa, please go.  Ten of your friends that you like us and maybe we could get ten new listeners through you.  Elise, she loves us.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, please tell your friends.  Okay.  Rob Bloomfield, he loves us.  Oh, I'm feeling love.  Thanks, Rob.  Thanks, man.  Well, this lady on line seven doesn't like us.  Hello, N.E.W.?  Yes, hi.  Hi.  We just wanted to let you know that because of these two idiots you have on in the afternoon,  we no longer listen to WNEW. 
[12:30]
 We're very upset to hear that.  No, I'm sure you're not.  Is there anything we can do that maybe can change your mind?  Yeah, you can get these morons off the air.  You want us to fire them?  I'd like you to get them off the air or give them a lesson in humanity.  What did they do that seems to have gotten you so agitated, miss?  It's just a lack of disrespect.  Lack of disrespect?  Yeah, sir.  Everything and everybody.  I know you'll want them, so it doesn't really matter to me.  Oh, she's on to me.  Oh, wow, yeah, you're pretty smart.  Usually these are a bunch of dopes that call up. 
[13:00]
 They're people who live in these places.  What do you do?  Well, they're all over the place.  I thought Mayor Giuliani was shutting down the whorehouses.  Sir, that's your mother's job, honey, not mine.  Oh, hey, look at the mouth on you.  See, you're a hypocrite.  You're a hypocrite.  You talk like that all the time.  You just called my mother a whore.  Listen to you.  You just called me a whore.  Hypocrite.  You just called me a whore.  You eat what the hell you are.  No, you could be the receptionist at the whorehouse.  You could be the squeegee girl.  You're going to squeegee the rooms out.  I would much rather be a madame at a whorehouse. 
[13:30]
 You're the splooge mop girl.  You're the splooge broad.  I would much rather be a madame at a whorehouse.  You listen to your radio station.  All right.  So listen to you morons.  Wait, can you say that again?  Because we need that for a promo.  Go ahead, say it loud.  Say it nice and loud.  You'll be part of our show.  We're getting some good ones today.  You know why you're getting good ones today?  Because you really are not deserving of having a radio show.  Yeah, obviously.  OK.  So keep listening.  In six months, tell us how much we suck.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. 
[14:00]
 Listen to the vulgarity.  Bye-bye.  You're a vulgar woman.  You're vulgar.  Come on.  Let me go.  You're down with old feet and that's the thing.  You're down with old feet and that's the thing.  You're down with old feet and that's the thing.  You're down with old feet and that's the thing.  Man, I don't know about you, but I need some smack.  1027WNEW, where rock lives, foreigner.  It's OP and it's Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's up?  It's Friday, quitting time coming.  Who's doing the celebrity traffic today?  Is it Reverend Al Sharpton? 
[14:30]
 I believe Reverend Al.  Reverend Al today?  Yeah.  OK.  Because Charlton Heston is a little under the weather, so we have to give him a week  off, I guess.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.

That's off.  Yeah, that's off.  All right.  Yeah, right there.  We're going to go to the closet.  That's off.  And that's on.  No, it just kind of lightens everything up.  All right.  Get around the light.  What are those guys doing outside the studio?  I just kind of found them when I was doing the laundry.  I just kind of found them when I was doing the laundry.

[20:00]
 And I just, they sort of came along for the excitement, I guess.  Okay, great.  All right.  Security.  Do we have security here at any W?  No.  No.  Well, that didn't work.  Okay.  Damn.  Great.  Well, thanks for stopping by for your Van Halen tickets.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  Okay, and Anthony?  Yeah.  You guys are really hot.  Yeah.  Well, thanks.  Thank God there's radio.  Thanks, pretty much. 
[20:30]
 No, I say what I mean.  I'm telling you.  And so do I.  Oh, wait.  Look who's coming into the studio here.  Cybertraffic.  Thank you for stopping by.  I really appreciate it.  Hey, everyone.  It's Al Sharpton.  Traffic.  I have been vindicated.  No justice, no peace.  No justice, no peace.  Traffic is a product of the white man.  Why should I care if there's?  Traffic is a product of the white man.  Why should I care if there's?  Traffic is a product of the white man.  Traffic is a product of the white man.  Traffic is a product of the white man.  Why should I care if there's traffic on the White Stone Bridge?  My brothers and sisters, we must boycott the GWB until they rename it the George Washington 
[21:00]
 Carver Memorial Peanut Bridge.  Why do you think the roads are made of blacktop?  That's so the white man can symbolically drive over us.  White folks right now are clogging up the LIE like my calling at the government G-Satel.  Oh, come on, Al.  They're all late for their KKK meeting. 
[21:30]
 All the easy path lanes are moving today.  Why?  Because the powers that be want us to buy their easy path to tag us and track us.  I am pleased to announce that traffic is heavy at the Reverend Al Sharpton toll booth in front  of the Palo Theater.  Give your change to your pal Reverend Al.  When you drive on through, slip me a buck or two.  Give your buddy Al a hand. 
[22:00]
 I owe Steve Pagone 65 grand.  No justice, no peace.  No justice, no peace.  I have to give you change.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Obey and Anthony.  I'm going to have nightmares.  Whose idea was that to bring that chick in here?  I said I just wanted to see if this damn camera worked with the, it's supposed to be X-ray.  I haven't seen the night vision on.  I haven't seen a chick naked in weeks and I have to see that.  Does anyone have any mouthwash?  I've got to get that teeth out of my mouth. 
[22:30]
 Hey, I like some bacon with my eggs.  Oh, my gosh.  Maybe I don't like girls anymore.  I see a little lacking in the breast area.  Howard gets playboy models and we get skank hoes.  What the hell is wrong with us over here?  Geez.  Hey, great bet.  Great idea, man.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  I just want to see if the camera works.  Thank you.  Will you?  1027WIW is over there.  I want to see if you can get it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[23:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  1027WIW, the rock of New York.  Hit the poster, baby.  1027WIW, the rock of New York.  Bad case of loving you, Robert Palmer.  It's opiate, Anthony.  Rigging Sodom and Gomorrah in here today.  I love it.  Well, I finally got that image out of my head.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Anyway, what's going on?  Oh, tomorrow night, Saturday night, beginning at 10 p.m., NEW presents the Dave Matthews  Band in concert from the Ten Spot.  That's going to be very exciting.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.

I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there. 
[24:00]
 I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there. 
[24:30]
 I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there. 
[25:00]
 people call their moms and play the game, Hi Mom.  They tell them horrible things.  Yeah, in this case it was, Hi Mom, I'm gay.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, semi-sonic and closing time.  You too before that from the Joshua Tree.  It's Hopi and Anthony.  You know, I want to go on the record and I want to applaud this cop in Yonkers for giving  that guy the ticket for not speaking English.  Yeah, I never knew that was against the law, but I guess it is.  No.  No commercial vehicle.  I'll tell you the details. 
[25:30]
 This guy was driving a huge truck, right?  Commercial vehicles.  Commercial vehicles.  And there is an obscure law that if you're driving a truck that is as big as the one  he was driving, they ask that you speak English.  Right.  It's just part of it.  There's a lot of signs, I guess, and things they have to know.  You have to be able to speak the language of the land.  Yes.  Well, this guy is claiming discrimination and all this crap.  And I just want to applaud the cop for giving this guy the ticket.  Simple as that.  And I'll tell you why.  Because this is America. 
[26:00]
 What is happening to America?  I only ask one thing.  We have a lot of people coming into the country on a daily basis, right?  Right.  The one thing you hear is, your ancestors came over here.  That's fine.  But when my ancestors came over here, they learned the language.  Every time you turn around, it's getting harder and harder to communicate in this city.  I understand.  I think that's why no one communicates. 
[26:30]
 Do you realize that the number one radio station in New York is a station that speaks half  Spanish and half English?  What is that saying for our country?  At the same time, it's confusing.  Pretty much at the same time.  In one sentence, they'll do half the sentence in Spanish and half in English.  It's a lot of it together with a mother in square garden.  Right.  Have you tried to get a pack of cigarettes?  Yeah.  Have you tried to ask for directions at a gas station?  It's impossible.  Not here.  You go to an ATM machine and you have to tell the damn machine what language you speak. 
[27:00]
 I ask one thing.  You come into this country just learning the language.  It's America.  What happened to America?  I don't know.  It just doesn't seem to be catching on.  Call me a racist.  Call me whatever you want.  But it's really starting to be annoying.  Like I said, number one station in New York is the Spanish station.  They had a thing in the paper last week or the week before that they're starting a Spanish 
[27:30]
 news station.  Right.  The news is going to be completely in Spanish.  It sort of takes any initiative you might have for learning the language.  We just keep placating to this.  Our forefathers fought for every inch they could get.  Right?  Sure.  You ever try watching the Yankees lately when the only broadcast they got on is the Spanish 
[28:00]
 broadcast?  How frustrating is that?  It is.  I agree.  I am completely serious here.  This is no bit.  No, I agree.  That's why I think everybody is so unfriendly when you go into stores.  When you used to go into a store and buy something it was, hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Next day, blah, blah, blah.  Now it's just whatever.  They're unfriendly because they cannot communicate.  People cannot communicate with each other anymore in this country.  Simple as that.  I agree.  This guy is up in arms because this Yankees cop decided that this guy might be a hazard 
[28:30]
 to the roadways because he's driving this huge vehicle.  It's the law.  You've got to read the traffic signs especially if you've got like a five ton truck or something.  That's dangerous.  You've got to know that you're heading toward a low bridge or something.  What is that?  You see a sign, low bridge.  Right.  This guy is all ticked off.  You're in America.  Learn the language.  I don't want to take your heritage away.  If you still want to speak Spanish that's great too.  I don't care.  But learn the language.  I think it's just bad when you see the kids in the store too sometimes and they're just 
[29:00]
 speaking Spanish or whatever.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, or whatever language.  Don't you think the kids should be able to speak English?  Yes.  Okay.  And learn English?  And for the Spanish people driving trucks, I bet you two of them won't be able to speak  English. 
[29:30]
 Oh, that's just great.  That's what I need to hear.  But you know something?  If you were, I said something like that.  Oh, you know, I bet two out of five can't even speak English.  Oh, my God, how could you say that?  I'm getting way too politically correct.  You know, what if this guy, you know, he's driving a commercial vehicle that weighs about  five tons.  What if this guy, you know, plowed into, you know, a family of five on the highway because  he didn't read the sign correctly because he doesn't know that language?  Then I think people in this city would understand.  Yeah. 
[30:00]
 We got some email on this.  I think that's discrimination.  I was given my test, my driving test in Spanish.  All right.  I'll give it.  I'll give him this much.  This guy is a 61 year old guy that's been driving this truck.  He's been in this country since 1984, hasn't learned the language yet.  He goes to the Department of Motor Vehicles and because he doesn't speak English, the  Department of Motor Vehicles doesn't send him home and say, you know, why don't you  learn the language before you come back?  They give them the same exact test in Spanish. 
[30:30]
 Right.  The roadsides of this country are in English.  I like what I see.  What is he in like third grade?  They just going to show him two little symbols and say, hey, that's a stop sign.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Shapes, shapes and colors.  You have to learn shapes and colors now in this country to get your license.  Great.  Exactly.  Now that's lovely.  What is the instant feedback saying?  Randy said, I wish I spoke Spanish.  I'd get two more stations on my TV.  That's good. 
[31:00]
 Which is true.  The other guy says, hey, United States is a melting pot.  You're supposed to melt a little.  Guess he means learn the language.  And then I believe we're being cursed out in Chinese.  Chinese.  I can't tell.  I don't know where they got this font.  It's like hieroglyphics.  Wait a minute.  That font's not on my computer.  Let me see that.  Oh.  Is that what it says, Anthony?  I don't know.  I don't read hieroglyphics.  But you seem to have made a stink.  Well call me whenever you want.  But I think if you're coming over to this country, we don't ask for much really.  We really don't.  It's just one language. 
[31:30]
 Picture this if you would.  Picture in your head.  You move to France.  You're moving to France.  You live in there.  Everyone's speaking French.  So you're going to be here and you're going to be there.  So don't you ever go to that country that will ask to speak French.  It's a good thing they have that.  So we're learning French here.  We are learning French here.  Which is why we're going to the next teacher.  Isn't that what you're saying?  I don't know.  I don't know English.  I don't know English.  It's a lot.  You move to France.  You're moving to France.  You live in there.  Everyone's speaking French except you.  What are you going to do?  Would you start going, �Hey, Frenchie, I'm going to speak English and you're going to 
[32:00]
 hire me and I'm going to work and I'm going to take my test for license or whatever and  you're going to give it to me in English.� No.  You would probably learn the language because it would be easier that way.  Or you can get right back on the Concorde and get back home to America.  Simple as that, right?  Yeah.  Hi, Andy W.  Yeah, Opi and Andy.  I agree wholeheartedly with you guys with this guy.  He's here 14 years and he can't speak English?  14 years. 
[32:30]
 14 years he's in this country, he can't speak English.  I mean, people from Brooklyn can speak English better than this guy.  Think about it.  You know what you've got to blame?  You've got to blame the Motor Vehicle Department.  They gave him the test in Spanish.  That's it.  Yeah, they gave him the Spanish test.  That's it.  When my grandfather came here from Italy, they told me, �Do you learn English or you  go back home?� Right.  Everybody's got to learn English.  Make it the American language.  Yeah, but everyone is too busy wondering if freaking Clinton splooged on that damn dress. 
[33:00]
 I don't understand.  Why don't we get some English classes going and screw the Monica and Bill?  And as far as the poor Joe Joe?  How do you say splooged in Spanish anyway?  Does anyone know?  El sploojo.  El sploojo.  Great.  That's what the problem is.  Our priorities are all screwed up in this country.  People in English lessons.  All right, bro.  Okay, take care, my man.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  Hey, Phil.  I was just listening to your show.  I'm stuck in traffic on a belt parkway. 
[33:30]
 I agree with you.  I want to give that cop a thumbs up on giving that ticket to the guy driving the truck that  didn't speak English.  Yeah.  I was in a Kentucky Fried Chicken the other day.  It's in Long Island in Oceanside.  And the two women that were there couldn't even get your orders straight because they  couldn't speak English.  I got nothing against people that don't speak English, but they shouldn't be dealing with  directly with the public in a capacity like that.  You've got to put an order in.  They don't understand what you're talking about.  They get the order wrong.  I think if you're taking orders from people in English, speaking the language would probably 
[34:00]
 be a good idea.  It's probably a plus for your job.  Right.  Yeah, it's got to be.  I think, like you said, you're not prejudiced or anything.  We didn't say we're not prejudiced.  We said we don't care if someone calls us prejudiced.  But you're in the United States.  You go for a license to drive or even a license to run a business, you should speak the language.  Well, motor vehicles have a Spanish test.  I know, they do.  That goes to show you everyone is so PC and sensitive these days that instead of saying 
[34:30]
 learn English, they said, oh, we'll make a Spanish test.  Right.  So you don't have to learn English.  What you said about your ancestors or whatever coming over to the country, my descendants  came from Italy to this country years ago and they didn't speak English.  But my father spoke English.  They taught him English.  And all of my other family, second generation, spoke English because they knew they needed  the language.  Of course.  What are we doing here?  Survival of the fittest in this country. 
[35:00]
 Come on.  I love your show, man.  Thank you.  Take care, bud.  Bye.  The New York Giants take on the Jaguars right here on N.E.W.  I can't remember.  I'm glad to be what I don't know.  I can't remember.  Buenos Dias.  Muchachos.  Los Borregos del Mundo.  United States of America.  Estados Unidos. 
[35:30]
 Oh, that's right.  Los Estados Unidos.  1027W, N.E.W., the Rock of New York.  That's Fuel and the song is Shimmer.  We're practicing our Spanish because we found out recently that the number one station in  New York is a Spanish station.  Yeah.  So we're hoping if maybe we could be bilingual, we'll get more listeners here at N.E.W.  I'm going to try my hardest to learn the language.  Yes.  Or el languijo.  We need to learn some good curses in other languages if we're going to continue with  our show.  Hey, tune in on Monday when we're on because we're on right after Clinton gives his testimony. 
[36:00]
 Yes.  I don't know if anything will leak.  Well, he's going to admit it.  He leaked.  He's going to admit it.  You think?  Yep.  He's going to admit it.  I'm reading here.  Clinton might say, I don't know what he's going to say, that his previous denial under oath  on a definition of sex could be because certain areas don't mean sex to him, including oral 
[36:30]
 sex.  So what they're saying is he was under oath saying he didn't have sex with her and he  got on TV, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.  Well, his definition is so now he might go in there and say that he said that because,  oh, sex, oh, it doesn't include sploogen on a dress.  No.  He's not going to be able to do anything about that.  And then he'll walk away.  And you ladies out there, you ladies, you love this guy.  You love them six and a half years ago. 
[37:00]
 You love them.  How old was Monica when that happened?  What is she now?  Twenty-five?  Yeah.  Or was it like twenty-two, twenty-three?  Twenty-one.  Twenty-one, whatever.  So here he is, the guy in his late forties.  There's a 21-year-old intern and he's getting oral favors in the White House.  And the women love him.  Yeah.  But if that was, let's say, say it's a teacher or something or, you know, a boss at a regular 
[37:30]
 job somewhere, oh my God, there'd be an outcry.  Get rid of this guy.  Regardless, and that isn't even an issue of if he said anything under oath or this or that.  That would just be ethics.  Yeah.  It's ethically wrong that he has an intern and he's using her for sex.  He's going to get away with this one too.  You watch.  Sure he will.  You watch.  I will go on record here.  He's going to win it one day.  He's going to say his definition is different and that he did not lie but he did have, you  know, well, he had oral sex with Monica or he got oral sex with Monica, I should say. 
[38:00]
 Prize dress containing the patch of presidential porridge.  All right.  It's time for our only sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show.  Been on the air two months and we got one new sponsor.  Great.  Here it is.  N.E.W.  Where Rock Lives With the Who.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got to step aside here because the Giants are coming our way in just a bit here.  One of the Jaguars tonight and you can listen to it right here on N.E.W. 
[38:30]
 We'll be on the radio again Monday at 3.  Thanks to our faithful listeners for tuning us in.  Yeah.  All week long.  We really, really appreciate it guys, seriously.  So they got a little brutal there, huh?  Yeah, that's why.  We gave some people some hell back today.  I'll bite.  Yeah, I thought we were able to defend ourselves a little bit better today.  Well, I'm feeling a little more comfortable because we have people that are on our side  now a little bit.  A little bit.  You know, they're starting to come out of the woodwork.  Not many, but they're coming around and they're starting to tell people about the show and  hopefully we could build something here. 
[39:00]
 So it's a little more comfortable when these people call up and they don't have an open  mind and they don't want change and they start giving us hell to turn around and go, you  know something?  F you.  Very good.  You want to end the show on the light note here?  No.  All right.  Okay, why?  Well, we've been getting a lot of, you know, people emailing and they're requesting bits  left and right.  And we're going to break one out from about a month ago, actually.  We've had a bunch of requests for this and we'll give it to you now.  The time the lady called up and complained because we used the word pussy. 
[39:30]
 Poo-ha.  The wrong way.  Poo-ha.  And in the middle of the call, like she's still on the line as we're trying to go back  alive on the radio and stuff and it was yelling.  It was pretty entertaining.  This will lighten the load.  All right?  All right, man.  All right.  Stay tuned for the Giants, but here's the call.  It's going to be on the NW. </pre>
