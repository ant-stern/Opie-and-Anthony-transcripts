<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts boasting about their increasing popularity, evidenced by jammed phone lines.  They then launched into a satirical bit about disastrous Sonny and Cher audition attempts in Times Square, describing the participants with harsh, judgmental, and crude language.  The conversation shifted to newly discovered letters revealing Eleanor Roosevelt's lesbian relationship, which the hosts discussed using graphic sexual language and crude jokes, reading excerpts from the letters aloud. This segment was followed by a flurry of listener calls, ranging from positive feedback to furious, obscenity-laced attacks directed at Opie and Anthony. One particularly heated exchange with an angry female caller devolved into a mutual volley of vulgar insults, a clip of which was considered for use in a future promotional spot.

Next, the hosts played a recording of their commute, featuring Anthony's profanity-laced tirades at other drivers and their commentary on pedestrians. A contest winner then visited the studio to claim their Van Halen tickets. This visit involved a humorous, albeit potentially insensitive, segment where the hosts attempted (and failed) to use a purported x-ray camera on her, culminating in an accidental flash and their subsequent comments.  Al Sharpton then joined the show via phone to deliver a comedic traffic report riddled with racial slurs and politically charged commentary. The broadcast concluded with further discussion about the listener response, a repeat of a previous segment featuring a caller complaining about the hosts' use of the word "pussy," and a final discussion about Bill Clinton's impending testimony concerning the Monica Lewinsky scandal.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York, the Dave Matthews Band.  Day.  I want backup singers for our show, just to stand in the background and go,  That would be pretty cool.  Set up three mics and have them dancing.  You want backup singers and we can't even get anyone to work on our show.  Who are you kidding?  That'd be great after we just say something, hey, NEW. 
[00:00:30]  Saturday night, beginning at 10 p.m., NEW presents the Dave Matthews Band in concert from the 10th spot.  That's something to look forward to this weekend.  Hey, our listeners are starting to figure it out here.  What?  Wow, look at that.  All 12 phone lines ringing at one time right now.  Nice.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Remember when we first started coming around the NEW studios?  Hello?  Hello?  Is anyone out there?  Yeah, we had to sit in the studio so we could learn this whole system, and we looked at the phone lines. 
[00:01:00]  Wait, is that broke?  Yeah.  One person called in four hours.  Yeah.  But now we got all 12 lines ringing before we even gave out the phone number.  That's a good sign here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you, Dave.  Hey, and we also got to say hi to Jackie, Steph, and Laura, the multi-generational group.  Smart.  First facts of the day, 212-957-WNEW is the facts line.  You see what's going on in Times Square today?  I just saw a crowd. 
[00:01:30]  What are they doing down there today?  Sonny and Cher auditions for the Sonny and Cher TV movie.  Come on.  That great thing they're putting together.  Oh, that's going to be another bomb.  What a freak show.  Yeah.  These people come out.  I guess they're all pumped up that they might have a shot.  Some of these girls, girls, old ladies that came out to meet Cher.  Oh, my God.  They could have been like the Wicked Witch. 
[00:02:00]  Really?  Had the long hair and that was about it.  They got the Paula Jones nose working thinking they look like Cher.  Yeah.  And then Sonny.  One guy, he looked like Sonny after he hit the tree.  I swear to God.  And if you're going to do a movie about Sonny and Cher and you hear that there's going  to be these auditions, don't show up if you look like the old Sonny and Cher.  Yeah.  I think they want the young Sonny and Cher.  Yeah.  We'll age you.  You know, the people in charge of the movie, they'll age you.  They'll age you over the years.  With makeup.  Sure.  It's pretty impossible to turn a 60-year-old guy going, I got you, babe, into the young 
[00:02:30]  Sonny of the 60s and 70s.  It was that bad, huh?  It was horrible.  The one guy that I saw was wearing this big furry outfit.  Like Sonny used to wear the caveman outfit.  Sure.  And one guy looked like a bum.  They just pulled off the street.  Swear to God.  I don't even think he was trying to audition.  They just, like, a news crew was down there, shoved a mic in his face.  You're trying to audition to be Sonny?  Do you have some change? 
[00:03:00]  We should go down there and audition.  Oh, yeah.  Why not?  We have a better shot than anyone else.  Who would you be?  I'll be Cher.  You got me.  I didn't say anything.  Well, where were you getting that, then?  There was only two choices.  No, I'm going to be Chastity.  Yeah, you can do that.  Yeah, I can do that.  Speaking of Chastity, later on, we've got to talk about this revelation in the paper.  Eleanor Roosevelt.  Yeah.  Lesbian.  Oh, yeah.  Lesbian.  Don't you read the history books? 
[00:03:30]  It wasn't in the history books.  No?  No.  Well, they got letters or something to prove that she was a lesbian.  Yeah, there's a bunch of letters and everything.  Mm-hmm.  And horrible?  No.  Did you ever see a picture of her?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's just, I don't know.  You just never think, you know, Eleanor Roosevelt was doing that.  No?  No.  Okay.  Okay.  We'll get into that a little bit later.  Yeah.  All right.  And we've got the instant feedback set up and ready to go.  Between 3 and 7, you could go to the WNEW website and click on the instant feedback. 
[00:04:00]  That sends your emails right into the studio so we could read them immediately, especially if you've got something that we're talking about.  Mm-hmm.  A little angle on it, all right?  On the way, we've got Van Halen, who's coming to the beach tomorrow night.  We'll do some Van Halen with David Lee Roth, and Green Day is next.  Stay there.  Hey, let's say hi to the ladies at Nielsen, and a fax from Roland coming in.  It says, Dear Anus and Mandy, you guys rule, but who will take over the show when you go back to the 6th grade?  After summer vacation. 
[00:04:30]  Very nice.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW, where rock lives.  Van Halen and Kenny Wayne Shepard playing the beach tomorrow night and the PNC Arts Center on Sunday.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Rick is handing me a fax here.  What?  Get those two idiots off the air, Opie and Anthony.  Ha-ha.  They suck.  Ha-ha.  Oh, ouch, that hurt.  Still here.  Ha-ha.  Oh, that one hurt.  Boy, I don't think I can go on with the show now. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Ouch, that hurt.  Let's cash it in.  Hey, we got a ton of email overnight about the road rage thing we did yesterday.  I want to play it one last time before we, you know, put it in the archives for a while.  Call it what you want.  It's not road rage.  No, I don't think it really was road rage.  Basically, it's a look into our commute into the radio station, actually.  Me and Anthony taped the last five blocks of the ride in.  Anthony was driving.  He didn't know I was taping.  So, in between him cursing out all the other drivers on the road, we were making comments about all the people we saw on the sidewalks. 
[00:05:30]  The only people that don't curse at drivers are the people that are being cursed at.  That's it.  Plain and simple.  And that's all I was doing.  Okay.  But I think the comments between the cursing is just as enjoyable to listen to as well.  So, yeah, you've got to, you know, do something while you're driving.  So, you look at the people and you comment.  There you go.  The first comments that you'll hear on this little tape, you know, live from Anthony's car, is when we drove by a correctional facility.  Check this out.  Look at all the kids going to see Daddy. 
[00:06:00]  You're rocking out a Friday afternoon with Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW, where rock lives.  Can you just imagine that old broad mounting that old broad?  That is...  Oh, whoa.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  That's the latest from days of the new in the downtown.  Who turned around my eyes?  It's Opie and Anthony.  I guess a lot of people have seen the story in the post today.  This is a huge story, if you ask me.  Mrs. FDR.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:06:30]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Eleanor Roosevelt.  Lesbian love letters exposed.  Teeny words to an ex-reporter.  They found all these passionate love letters between Eleanor Roosevelt and this reporter, Lorena Hickok.  You said Hick.  Well, oddly enough, Eleanor, in the letters, always called her Hick.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess that second part of the name was... 
[00:07:00]  I don't even say.  Something she couldn't swallow.  All right.  You know, Eleanor's lover there...  Yeah.  She looks like George Washington.  Well, look at Eleanor.  She looks like Jimmy Carter.  Yeah, she does.  She looks like Jimmy Carter with a wig, and her lover looks like George Washington.  Oh, and they're doing the nasty bumping walkers.  Oh.  Jeez.  Oh.  Just think, during the height of World War II...  Mm-hmm.  FDR's carpet bombing Berlin, and she's carpet munching in Washington. 
[00:07:30]  Come on.  What a...  FDR was in a wheelchair before the days of Viagra.  Mm-hmm.  Probably all frustrated.  And there's Eleanor.  All found a little jaunt.  Yeah.  Here's some excerpts.  Okay, go ahead.  My pictures are nearly all up, and I have left you in my sitting room where I could look  at you most of my waking hours.  I can't kiss you, so I kiss your picture good night and good morning.  My dear, if you meet me, may I forget that there are any other reporters present, or must 
[00:08:00]  I behave?  I shall want to hug you to death.  I can hardly wait.  You see this one?  Most clearly, I remember your eyes with a kind of teasing smile in them, and that feeling  of that soft spot just northeast of the corner of your mouth against my lips.  Wow.  A little geriatric lesbian love going on there.  Who knew?  Who knew?  Come on. 
[00:08:30]  A little bit of scandal there.  Yeah.  Where do these letters come from, though?  I never even heard that rumor.  It's going to be in a new book?  Oh, these are in George Magazine this month.  Oh.  It's going to be in a new book.  More of these letters.  It's just from the late 20s to the mid-30s, I guess.  Right.  And later, actually, yeah.  She was having a lesbian affair with this reporter.  Yeah, this is great.  I didn't think there was lesbianism back then.  Well, they really had to keep it a secret.  That was right after, you know, because there was a whole time, you know, you didn't think 
[00:09:00]  about it.  Right.  You know, they were still using terms like gay was fun.  All right.  Remember that in the Flintstones song?  The meaning of that word sure changed, huh?  Sure has.  Sure has.  Used to mean happy.  Not anymore.  No.  It means something totally different.  All right.  212-757-1027. 
[00:09:30]  If you've got something to add to the program today, the faxes are coming in like crazy.  We'll put your name on the air.  Give us a fax.  212-957-WNEW.  We've got the talking heads and Harvey Danger next.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York with the verve.  It's Opie and Anthony after the show tonight.  Don't forget the Giants take on the Jacksonville Jaguars at 7-0-5.  We'll get going right here on NEW.  Do you want to take a complaint call?  All right.  Well, aren't you, you know, a radio personality and you're also upper management here at NEW? 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  Okay.  I scored that deal.  All right.  So handle this complaint call for us, all right?  NEW complaints.  Yeah, hi.  I want to complain about these two idiots you have there in drive time.  I've been listening to this station since the day it came on the air.  I want to work with you, sir.  What seems to be your problem with these gentlemen?  They just had a woman on the phone who called us to complain about foul language.  Right.  And they're telling her, don't worry, you'll keep listening and we'll keep pissing you off.  What is that?  And you don't think that's right for them to put on somebody that wants to voice a legitimate complaint? 
[00:10:30]  To put them on the air.  Put them on the air like that.  A woman that calls a complaint about language.  You feel it degrades them.  You feel it degrades the caller and makes them seem stupid.  It absolutely does.  And not only that, I mean, forgetting for a minute about the call.  Right.  Yes.  Continue, sir.  This station has gone downhill.  That's it.  Could you tell me what you think of Opie and Anthony? 
[00:11:00]  They're stupid.  It sucks.  We'll see you.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  The latest from 7 Mary 3.  That's over your shoulder.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Heading toward quitting time.  And if you're looking for something to do tonight, tonight is WNEW night at Rye Playland.  Will we be on hand at this event?  Hell no.  I don't think we'll be there.  Sorry.  No.  I don't think it's safe to leave the NEW studios yet.  No, no.  Not yet.  I'm hoping eventually it'll be safe enough to go out there and meet some listeners of NEW.  And we can bask in the light of day. 
[00:11:30]  But with the phone calls we're getting today, no, it's definitely not time yet to get out there  and shake some hands and stuff and drink beers with you guys.  It goes in phases.  Yeah, it does.  Today we're having a real bitchy day.  And people are just calling and complaining.  Yeah, they've had it with us.  But if you're heading to Rye Playland tonight, Ken Dachau is going to be there from 8 to 10  tonight.  He's got complimentary samples from Ben and Jerry's and plenty of WNEW giveaways.  Speaking of complaints, what do you got in the instant feedback? 
[00:12:00]  Anything?  Say hi to Melissa in New Jersey.  She loves us.  Oh, Melissa, please go.  Tell us 10 of your friends that you like us and me.  We like that.  Maybe we could get 10 new listeners through you.  So, Elise, she loves us.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, please, don't feel your friends.  Okay.  Rob Bloomfield.  He loves us.  Oh, I'm feeling love.  Thanks, Rob.  Thanks, man.  Well, this lady on line 7 doesn't like us.  Oh, hello, N.E.W.  Yes, hi.  Hi.  We just wanted to let you know that because of these two idiots you have on in the afternoon,  you no longer listen to WNEW. 
[00:12:30]  We're very upset to hear that.  No, I'm sure you're not.  Is there anything we can do that maybe can change your mind?  Yeah, you can get these morons off the air.  You want us to fire them?  I'd like you to get them off the air.  We'll give them a lesson in humanity.  What did they do?  That seems to have gotten you so agitated, miss.  It's just a total lack of disrespect.  Lack of disrespect?  Yeah, for everything and everybody.  I know you're one of those, so it doesn't really matter to me.  She's on to me.  Wow, yeah, you're pretty smart.  Usually these are a bunch of dopes that call up. 
[00:13:00]  They're people who listen to the conversation.  What do you do?  I thought Mayor Giuliani was shutting down the whorehouses.  No, that's your mother's job, honey, not mine.  Oh, look at your mouth.  Look at the mouth on you.  See, you're a hypocrite.  You're a hypocrite.  You talk like that all the time.  You just called my mother a whore.  Listen to you.  You just called me a whore.  Hypocrite.  You just called me a whore.  Hypocrite.  What the hell you are.  No, you could be the receptionist at the whorehouse.  You could be the squeegee girl.  You're going to squeegee the rooms out.  I would much rather be... 
[00:13:30]  You're the splooge mop girl.  You're the splooge broad.  You're the splooge broad.  You'd much rather be a madam at a whorehouse.  Don't listen to your radio.  All right.  Listen to you morons.  Wait, can you say that again?  Because we need that for a promo.  Go ahead.  Say it loud.  Say it nice and loud.  You'll be part of our show.  We're getting some good ones today, huh?  You know why you're getting good ones today?  Because you really are not deserving of having a radio show.  Yeah, obviously.  Okay.  So keep listening.  In six months, tell us how much we suck.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. 
[00:14:00]  Listen to the whole, Gary.  Bye-bye.  You're a vulgar woman.  You're vulgar.  Come on.  Let me go.  You got an old Pete and that's the thing.  You got an old Pete and that's the thing.  You got an old Pete and that's the thing.  You got an old Pete and that's the thing.  Man, I don't know about you, but I need some smack.  1027 WNEW, where rock lives, foreigner.  It's Opie and it's Anthony.  Ha-ha.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's up?  It's Friday quitting time coming.  Who's doing the celebrity traffic today? 
[00:14:30]  Is it Reverend Al Sharpton?  I believe Reverend Al.  Reverend Al today?  Yeah, okay.  Because Charlton Heston's a little under the weather, so we have to give him a week off,  I guess.  Sore throat yelling, damn, damn, damn, like that all the time.  Yes, he can't do that too many weeks in a row.  For a man of God, he sure says that word a lot.  Yes, he does, doesn't he?  Teresa in Brooklyn.  Got to say hi to her.  She gets the point.  Okay.  Thanks.  There's a weird thing happening on our show.  What's up?  That we should acknowledge.  There's like three groups of people. 
[00:15:00]  Okay.  The people that have been listening for a very long time that just hate our guts and can't  wait for us to get fired.  Okay.  And this isn't an age-based thing.  No.  No, no, it's not.  Because then there's a bunch of people that have been listening for a very long time.  They got an open mind.  They hated us at first, and we're starting to grow on them.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And then there's a whole S-load of brand new listeners coming in.  Yeah.  By the day.  We keep getting a lot of emails from people going, I just didn't listen to the station.  Yeah.  But everyone is like fighting it out.  I don't know which group's going to win. 
[00:15:30]  Will we be fired?  Will we be successful in New York?  Does anyone care?  I like the long-time listeners that hate us are the funniest ones.  Yeah.  Because, man, they got opinions.  Yeah, and they just don't want to change.  That's fine.  They want their jukebox back.  They want their jukebox back.  They've been wearing the same shoes for 30 years, and they just don't want those brand  new Nikes.  There's plenty of people that have been listening a long time that, you know, enjoy some change,  a little different, shaking some stuff up a little bit in here in the afternoon. 
[00:16:00]  But it's a three-way tug-of-war going on.  It's very fascinating.  Because we got this instant feedback in the studio.  Mm-hmm.  And Anthony will read like four in a row that say, you guys are really great.  You're livening up my afternoon.  And then the next three in a row are, you guys suck.  You get off my radio.  I hope they fire you.  When are you leaving?  And then you have a few after that saying, you know, at first I really didn't like you  guys at all.  But you're starting to grow on me.  Like mold.  Like mold.  I know.  But at least we're growing on them. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  So.  I think this was the bit of the week.  What do you got?  We're up to that point.  I don't know.  We had a lot of cool things this week, actually.  But we got more email on the Donna Summer call than anything else.  Lady out of nowhere calling us trying to win Donna Summer tickets.  Yeah.  Pretty embarrassing.  Even N.E.W. isn't that bad.  Wrong station.  We wouldn't give away Donna Summer tickets.  She had the wrong station.  She had the wrong station.  Yes.  1027 W.N.E.W. 
[00:17:00]  Where rock lives queen, especially for the Yankees.  That's an easy request, huh?  Oh, please.  88 wins strong.  Eight in a row.  Playing the Rangers tonight at the stadium.  Mets playing the Diamondbacks tonight at 10.05.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  And who are you?  My name is Patricia.  Patricia.  She came to pick up Van Halen tickets.  Yeah.  I'm a lucky winner.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Where are you going?  Saturday and Sunday.  Both days.  Well, Jones and PNC. 
[00:17:30]  But I'm Jonesing with you guys.  Cool.  With that sexy voice of yours.  Well, thank you.  Yes, for you.  You know, let me tell you, Opie and Anthony.  Let me just breathe, okay?  Because you are just making my wildest dream come true.  Because this is my desire, my dream, my destiny.  And when I put my heart, my mind, my soul to something, I get what I want.  All right.  Well, we brought her in here today because I want to check out if this camera thing works.  Hey, you got that filter? 
[00:18:00]  Well, you know what it is.  I have a Sony Handycam.  Yeah, explain this.  And in the news, it said that if you have one of these Handycams that have this night spot,  it's like an infrared lens on it, that if you put it on a girl, or anybody actually,  for me it's a girl, you can see through her clothes if you don't use it at night.  So I figured you'd be a good model.  We'll put some lights on you.  I'll flip this on, and I'll see if I can see you.  What are you wearing under there?  Under that shirt. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yuck.  She just flashed.  Don't touch me.  She just flashed us.  Were you in a boating accident?  No.  You're not being very nice.  You've got a boat.  You're not being very nice.  Well, you are.  What the hell was that?  I'm horrified.  Oh, my God.  Thank you very much.  Can I see that again?  No.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't like that.  It was quick.  It was like an illusion.  Yeah, it was a big illusion.  We need David Copperfield. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  Thank you.  Opie, you're bitter today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's the first girl we've had in the studio since we've gotten this gig here at NEW,  and you're berating her?  I'm not a sidekick.  I'll be like in the middle of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Let's see.  Stand up in that beam of light right there.  Let's see if this works, or if this is just a bunch of...  Can you put a shadow on?  Let's see.  Hold it.  Hold it.  All right.  That's with it off.  Okay.  I'm seeing...  Let me see.  Hold on.  Let's see.  Okay. 
[00:19:30]  I see, like, those little points poking out of the black shirt.  Now I'm going to turn it on.  Okay.  Turn it on the filter.  Doesn't work.  Well, wait a minute.  Can you...  What do you think, Rick?  That's all.  Down under the light.  Yeah.  That's off.  All right.  Yeah, right there.  Okay.  We're in the closet.  That's off.  And that's on.  No, it just kind of lightens everything up.  All right.  Get around the light.  What are those guys doing outside the studio?  I just kind of found them when I was leaving another... 
[00:20:00]  Picking up other tickets, and I just...  They sort of came along for the excitement, I guess.  Okay, great.  All right.  Security.  Security.  All right.  Do we have security here at any W?  No.  No.  Great.  Well, that didn't work.  Okay.  Damn.  Great.  Well, thanks for stopping by for your Van Halen tickets.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  Oh, Pete and Anthony?  Yeah.  You guys are really hot.  Yeah.  Wow, thanks.  Thank God this radio.  Thanks.  Appreciate it.  No, I say what I mean. 
[00:20:30]  I'm telling you.  And so do I.  Oh, wait.  Look who's coming into the studio here.  It's time for traffic.  Thanks for stopping by.  I really appreciate it.  Hey, everyone.  It's Al Sharpton, Traffic.  I have been vindicated.  No justice, no peace.  No justice, no peace.  Traffic is a product of the white man.  Why should I care if there's traffic on the White Stone Bridge?  My brothers and sisters, we must boycott the GWB until they rename it the George Washington Carver Memorial Peanut Bridge. 
[00:21:00]  Why do you think the roads are made of blacktop?  That's so the white man can symbolically drive over us.  White folks right now are clogging up the L.I.E. like my calling at the government cheese sandwich.  Oh, come on, Al.  They all late for that KKK meeting. 
[00:21:30]  All the easy path lanes are moving today.  Why?  Because the powers that be want us to buy their easy path to tag us and track us.  I am pleased to announce traffic is heavy at the Reverend Al Sharpton Toe Boots in front of the Pirlo Theater.  Give your change to your pal, Reverend Al.  When you drive on through, split me a buck or two.  Give your buddy, Al, a hand. 
[00:22:00]  I owe Steve Pagona 65 grand.  No justice, no peace.  No justice, no peace.  All right, there he goes.  Al Sharpton, everyone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Obi and Anthony.  God, I'm going to have nightmares.  Whose idea was that to bring that chick in here?  I said I just wanted to see if this damn camera worked with the, uh, it's supposed to be x-ray.  I haven't seen it.  With the night vision on.  I haven't seen a chick naked in weeks and I have to see that.  Does anyone have any mouthwash? 
[00:22:30]  I've got to get that taste out of my mouth.  Hey, I'd like some, uh, bacon with my eggs.  All right.  Oh, God.  I'm hard to find it.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I don't like girls anymore.  Well, she was a little lacking in the, uh...  A little.  ...rest area.  Howard gets Playboy models and we get skank hoes.  What the hell is wrong with us over here?  Jeez.  Hey, great bit.  Great idea, Ann.  Thank you.  I just wanted to see if the camera works. 
[00:23:00]  Thank you.  Do you?  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York.  Hit the post here, baby.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York.  Bad case of loving you, Robert Palmer.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Rigging Sodom and Gomorrah in here today.  I love it.  Well, I finally got that image out of my head.  Thank God.  Oh, my God.  Anyway, what's going on?  Oh, tomorrow night, Saturday night, beginning at 10 p.m.,  NEW presents the Dave Matthews Band in concert from the 10 spot. 
[00:23:30]  That's going to be very cool.  Something to look forward to this weekend.  We got Van Halen at the beach tomorrow night and then at the PNC Arts Center on Sunday.  And also, what are we doing tonight?  All right, Ken Daschow's doing NEW night at Ride Playland tonight.  We would love to go.  I would love to get out there and meet some of the NEW listeners,  but we just simply don't think it's safe yet.  No, not yet.  We've still got too many people that just hate us.  Hate us.  Maybe we could get some type of, like, armor or something and go out there. 
[00:24:00]  A Popemobile.  Yeah, that's what we need.  Let's get a Popemobile and we'll meet the NEW listeners.  You know, an armored personnel carrier.  That would be cool.  Yeah.  All right.  But, yeah, Ken's going to be up there from 8 to 10.  He's got complimentary samples from Ben & Jerry's and plenty of WNEW giveaways.  So go say hi to Ken tonight at Ride Playland.  All right?  Yes.  Want to go to the phone and see what's going on today?  All right.  NEW, what do you got?  Not much.  Listen, I was just listening to you talk about people loving and hating you,  so I figured I'd call throw my two cents in if you guys want to hear it. 
[00:24:30]  Sure, go ahead.  I actually have been listening to NEW forever,  and I'm probably one of those guys who didn't like you at first.  But yesterday afternoon you played a tape of that Mom, I'm Gay thing.  Yeah.  I was absolutely friggin' hysterical.  I was dying.  It was excellent.  So is that the bit that finally won you over?  I think so, yeah.  Hey, thanks a lot, man.  All right, no problem, guys.  All right.  See you later.  That's cool.  Maybe we can win over another listener.  We've got to play that.  We have one more play left in that thing, don't we?  All right.  Our game that we like to play, we did this this past Mother's Day,  where we have people call their moms and play the game Hi, Mom. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And tell them horrible things.  Yeah.  In this case, it was Hi, Mom.  I'm Gay.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York, semi-sonic and closing time.  You two before that from the Joshua Tree.  It's Hopi and Anthony.  You know, I want to go on the record, and I want to applaud this cop in Yonkers for giving  that guy the ticket for not speaking English.  Yeah.  I never knew that was against the law, but I guess it is, a commercial vehicle.  Now, what are the details? 
[00:25:30]  This guy was driving a huge truck, right?  Commercial vehicle.  Commercial vehicle.  And there is an obscure law that if you're driving a truck that is as big as the one he  was driving, they ask that you speak English.  Right.  It's just part of it.  There's a lot of signs, I guess, and things that you have to know.  You have to be able to speak the language of the land.  Yes.  Well, this guy is claiming discrimination and all this crap, and I just want to applaud  the cop for giving this guy the ticket.  Simple as that.  And I'll tell you why. 
[00:26:00]  Because this is America.  What is happening to America?  I only ask one thing.  We have a lot of people coming into the country on a daily basis, right?  Right.  And the one thing you hear is, your ancestors came over here.  That's fine.  But when my ancestors came over here, they learned the language!  Every time you turn around, it's getting harder and harder to communicate in this city.  Mm-hmm.  I understand.  I think that's why no one communicates. 
[00:26:30]  Do you realize that the number one radio station in New York is a station that speaks  half Spanish and half English?  What is that saying for our country?  At the same time?  It's confusing.  Pretty much at the same time.  In one sentence, they'll do half the sentence in Spanish and half in English.  Oh, that's right.  We're going to talk about the Madison Square Garden.  Right.  Have you tried to get a pack of cigarettes?  Yeah.  It's impossible.  Have you tried to ask for directions at a gas station?  It's impossible.  Not years.  You go to an ATM machine, and you have to tell the damn machine what language you speak. 
[00:27:00]  I ask one thing.  You come into this country, just learn the language.  It's America!  What happened to America?  I don't know.  It just doesn't seem to be catching on.  Call me a racist.  Call me whatever you want, but it's really starting to be annoying.  Mm-hmm.  You know, like I said, the number one station in New York, you know, is the Spanish station.  Okay?  They had a thing in the paper last week or the week before that they're starting a Spanish 
[00:27:30]  news station.  Right.  The news is going to be completely in Spanish.  It sort of takes any initiative you might have for learning the language if we just keep  placating to this.  Our forefathers fought for every, you know, inch they could get.  Right?  Sure.  You ever try, you know, try watching the Yankees lately?  When the only broadcast they got on is the Spanish broadcast? 
[00:28:00]  How frustrating is that?  It is.  I agree.  I am completely serious here.  This is no bit.  No, I agree.  And that's why I think everybody is so unfriendly when you go into stores.  When you used to go into a store and buy something, it was, you know, hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Next day, blah, blah, blah.  Now it's just, you know, whatever.  They're unfriendly because they cannot communicate with you.  People cannot communicate with each other anymore in this country.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  All right.  I agree. 
[00:28:30]  So this guy is up in arms because this Yankees cop decided that this guy might be a hazard  to the roadways because he's driving this huge vehicle.  It's the law.  And you got to read the traffic signs, especially if you've got like a, what, there's like a  five-ton truck or something?  Yeah.  That's dangerous.  You got to know that you're heading toward a low bridge or something.  What does that mean?  You see a sign, low bridge.  Right.  And this guy's all ticked off.  You're in America.  Learn the language.  I don't want to take your heritage away. 
[00:29:00]  If you still want to speak Spanish, that's great too.  I don't care.  But learn the language.  I think it's just bad when you see the kids in the store too sometimes and they're just  speaking Spanish or whatever language.  Don't you think the kids should be able to speak English?  Yes.  Okay.  Learn English.  And for the Spanish people driving trucks, I bet you two of them won't be able to speak  English.  Oh, that's just great. 
[00:29:30]  That's what I need to hear.  Now that, but you know something?  If you or I said something like that, ooh, you know I bet two out of five can't even speak  English, oh my God, how could you say that?  Right.  Well, this world is getting way too politically correct.  You know, what if this guy, you know, he's driving a commercial vehicle that weighs about  five tons.  What if this guy, you know, plowed into, you know, a family of five on the highway because  he didn't read the sign correctly because he doesn't know that language?  Then I think people in this city would understand. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Well, we got some email on this.  I think that's discrimination.  I was given my test, my driving test in Spanish.  Yeah, what?  All right, I'll give it, I'll give him this much, this guy.  He's a 61-year-old guy that's been driving this truck.  He's been in this country since 1984, hasn't learned the language yet.  He goes to the Department of Motor Vehicles, and because he doesn't speak English, the Department  of Motor Vehicles doesn't send him home and say, you know, why don't you learn the language  before you come back?  Mm-hmm.  They give him the same exact test in Spanish. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  The road signs of this country are in English!  Oh!  Oh!  I like what Randy...  What is he, what is he, in like third grade, they're just going to show him, shoot little  symbols and say, hey, that's a stop sign.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Shapes.  Shapes and colors.  You have to learn shapes and colors now in this country to get your license.  Great.  Exactly.  Oh, that's lovely.  What is the instant feedback saying?  Randy said, I wish I spoke Spanish, I'd get two more stations on my TV. 
[00:31:00]  That's good.  Which is true.  Another guy says, hey, United States is a melting pot, you're supposed to melt a little.  Guess he means learn the language.  And then, I believe we're being cursed out in Chinese.  Chinese?  I can't tell.  I don't know where they got this font.  It's like hieroglyphics.  Wait a minute, that font's not on my computer.  Let me see that.  Is that what it says, Anthony?  I don't know.  I don't read hieroglyphics. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  But, you know, I don't know.  You seem to have made a stink.  Well, call me whatever you want, but I think if you're coming over to this country, you know,  we don't ask for much, really.  Mm-hmm.  We really don't.  Just learn the language.  Picture this, if you would.  Picture in your head, you move to France.  Okay.  You're moving to France.  Yeah.  You're living there.  Mm-hmm.  Everyone's speaking French.  Mm-hmm.  Except you.  Right.  What are you going to do?  Wouldn't you want to, would you start going, hey, hey, Frenchie, I'm going to speak English, 
[00:32:00]  and you're going to hire me, and I'm going to work, and I'm going to take my test for license  or whatever, and you're going to give it to me in English?  No.  You would probably learn the language, because it would be easier that way for you.  Or you're going to get right back on the Concord and get back home to America.  Right.  Simple as that, right?  Yeah.  Hi, Andy W.  Yeah, Opie and Andy.  Yeah.  I agree wholeheartedly with you guys with this guy.  He's here 14 years, and he can't speak English?  14 years. 
[00:32:30]  14 years he's in this country, he can't speak English.  I mean, even people from Brooklyn can speak English better than this guy.  Think about it.  You know what you've got to blame?  You've got to blame the motor vehicle department.  They gave him the test in Spanish.  That's it.  Yeah, they gave him a Spanish test.  That's it.  When my grandfather came here from Italy, they told me that you learn English or you go  back home.  Right.  Everybody's got to learn English.  Make it the American language.  Yeah, but everyone is too busy wondering if freaking Clinton splooged on that damn dress. 
[00:33:00]  I don't understand.  Why don't we get some English classes going and screw the Monica and Bill?  How do you say splooged in Spanish anyway?  Does anyone know?  El Splujo.  El Splujo.  Great.  That's what the problem is.  Our priorities are all screwed up in this country.  And Paul Jones never said it.  Get out of the way.  People in English lessen.  All right, bro.  Okay.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  Later, man.  Wow.  Hey, Phil.  I was just listening to your show.  I'm in fucking traffic on a Belt Parkway, and I agree with you. 
[00:33:30]  I want to give that cop a thumbs up on giving that ticket to the guy driving the truck that  didn't speak English.  Yeah.  I was in a Kentucky Fried Chicken the other day, and it's in Long Island in Oceanside,  and the two women that were there couldn't even get your order straight because they  couldn't speak English.  I got nothing against people that don't speak English, but they shouldn't be dealing directly  with the public in a capacity like that.  You've got to put an order in.  They don't understand what you're talking about.  They get the order wrong.  I think if you're taking orders from people in English, speaking the language would probably 
[00:34:00]  be a good idea.  That's probably a plus for your job.  Yeah.  It's got to be.  I mean, I think, like you said, you're not prejudiced or anything, but...  We didn't say we're not prejudiced.  We said we don't care if someone calls us prejudice.  But you're in the United States.  You go for a license to drive or even a license to run a business.  You should speak the language.  Well, Motor Vehicle has a Spanish test.  I know.  They do.  They're right.  That goes to show you, everyone is so PC and sensitive these days that instead of saying 
[00:34:30]  learn English, they said, oh, we'll make a Spanish test.  Right, right.  So you don't have to learn English.  Yeah.  And, you know, what you said about your ancestors or whatever coming over in the country.  I mean, my descendants came from Italy to this country years ago, and they didn't speak  English, but my father spoke English.  They taught him English.  And all of my other family, you know, second generation spoke English because they knew they  needed the language.  Of course.  You know, hey, what are we doing here? 
[00:35:00]  Survival of the fittest in this country.  Come on.  Hey, I love your show, man.  Thank you.  Take care, buddy.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, don't forget, coming up at 7 o'clock, the New York Giants take you on the Jaguars right  here on NEW.  I want to be happy with you.  I don't see anything.  Good day, guys.  Los Vargos del Mundo.  United States of America.  Estados Unidos. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, that's right.  Los Estados Unidos.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York, that's Fuel, and the song is Shimmer.  We're practicing our Spanish because we found out recently that the number one station in  New York is a Spanish station.  Yeah.  So we're hoping if maybe we could be bilingual, we'll get more listeners here at NEW.  I'm going to try my hardest to learn the language.  Yes.  Or El Languijo.  We need to learn some good curses in other languages if we're going to continue with our  show.  Hey, tune in on Monday when we're on because we're on right after Clinton gives his testimony. 
[00:36:00]  Yes.  I don't know if anything will leak.  Well, he's going to admit it.  Except for Clinton, he leaked.  He's going to admit it.  You think?  Yep.  He's going to admit it.  I'm reading here, Clinton might say, because I don't know what he's going to say, that his  previous denial under oath on a definition of sex could be because certain areas don't  mean sex to him, including oral sex. 
[00:36:30]  So what they're saying is, he was under oath saying he didn't have sex with her, and he  got on TV, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.  Well, his definition is, so now he might go in there and say that he said that because,  oh, oh, sex, oh, it doesn't include splooging on a dress.  No.  And they're not going to be able to do anything about that.  No.  And then he'll walk away, ha, oops.  And you ladies out there, you ladies, you love this guy.  You loved him six and a half years ago. 
[00:37:00]  You loved him.  How old was Monica when that happened?  What is she now, 25?  Yeah.  What was it, like 22, 23, I think?  21.  21, whatever.  So here he is, the guy in his, you know, late 40s, there's a 21-year-old intern, and  he's getting oral favors in the White House, and the women love him.  Yeah.  But if that was, let's say, say it's a teacher or something, or, you know, a boss at a regular 
[00:37:30]  job somewhere, oh, my God, there'd be an outcry.  Get rid of this guy.  Regardless, and that isn't even an issue of if he said anything under oath or this or that.  That would just be ethics.  Yeah.  It's ethically wrong.  Yeah.  That he has an intern, and he's using her for sex.  He's going to get away with this one, too.  You watch.  Sure he will.  You watch.  He'll admit it.  Sure he will.  I will go on record here.  He's going to admit it one day.  He's going to say his definition is different, and that he did not lie, but he did have,  you know, well, he had oral sex with Monica, or he got oral sex with Monica, I should say. 
[00:38:00]  Prized dress containing the patch of presidential porridge.  All right.  Hey, it's time for our only sponsor to the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  Been on the air two months, and we got one new sponsor.  Great.  Here it is.  102.7 WNEW, where rock lives with the who.  It's Sophie and Anthony.  We've got to step aside here, because the Giants are coming our way in just a bit here.  Playing the Jaguars tonight, and you can listen to it right here on NEW. 
[00:38:30]  Mm-hmm.  We'll be on the radio again Monday at 3.  Thanks to our faithful listeners for tuning us in.  Yeah.  All week long.  We really, really appreciate it, guys.  Seriously.  Today got a little brutal there, huh?  Yeah, that's why I...  We gave some people some hell back today.  Oh, bye.  Yeah, I thought we were able to defend ourselves a little bit better today.  Well, I'm feeling a little more comfortable, because we have people that are on our side  now a little bit.  A little bit?  You know, they're starting to come out of the woodwork.  Not many, but they're coming around, and they're starting to tell people about the show, 
[00:39:00]  and hopefully we could build something here.  So it's a little more comfortable when these people call up, and they don't have an open  mind, and they don't want change, and they start giving us hell to turn around and go,  you know something?  If you...  Very good.  You want to end the show on a light note here?  No!  All right.  Okay, well...  Well, we've been getting a lot of, you know, people emailing, and they're requesting bits  left and right, and we're going to break one out from about a month ago, actually.  We've had a bunch of requests for this, and we'll give it to you now.  At the time, the lady called up and complained because we used the word pussy. 
[00:39:30]  Poo-ha!  The wrong way.  Poo-ha!  And in the middle of the call, like, she's still on the line as we're trying to go back  live on the radio and stuff, and it was...  Yelling.  It was pretty entertaining.  This will lighten the load.  All right?  Yeah, man.  All right, stay tuned for the Giants, but here's the call.  Hi, N.E.W.  Is this open? </pre>
