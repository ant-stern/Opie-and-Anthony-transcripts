<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and highly offensive affair, marked by rampant profanity, sexual innuendo, and erratic shifts in topic. The show opened with sexually explicit comments from Opie and Anthony, along with Rich Voss, in a classroom-like studio plagued by microphone issues that formed a recurring comedic element.  They reviewed films like *Julia*, *Inglourious Basterds*, and *Ironweed*,  disagreeing on Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson's acting, and expressing dislike for subtitles.  Crude jokes about Tiger Woods' infidelity were also featured, interspersed with musical interludes featuring Pete Correale and Jimmy's attempts at playing guitar and singing. A caller challenged Voss's story about a costly car repair, sparking further vulgar exchanges.  A significant portion focused on the impending arrival of homeless individuals for a planned segment, with Keith, a police officer, tasked with collecting them, their eccentricities and hygiene described in detail. Voss recounted anecdotes about tipping mechanics, car troubles, and a near-toilet accident.  The hosts also shared personal hygiene stories.

A later segment featured major sponsor Stephen Singer and his assistant, Leanne.  Voss recounted a noisy hotel radiator and taking Singer to an Islanders game (which the Rangers won).  The conversation devolved into anti-Semitic jokes targeting Singer, including jokes about fake $100 bills with anti-Singer messages.  Their contract negotiations and studio renovation plans were also discussed, alongside inflammatory comments about Obama's climate summit and personal attacks between the hosts and guests.  A live audience, introduced by Sam,  provided further opportunities for off-color jokes about porn shops, strap-ons, and homeless people. Jim Florentine joined the show, and Intern David, in an awkward interview with Singer, concluded the segment by singing the Dreidel song. Bobo also made an appearance.

The "Homeless Talent Show" segment featured Jim Florentine, Rich Voss (experiencing graphic constipation), and Sandy Kane.  Several homeless individuals performed, including "Pops" (who had a vulgar exchange with Kane), Mustard (performing Radiohead's "Creep" and The Cure's "Boys Don't Cry"), his friend Boris, and Sandra (who rapped).  The hosts made crude jokes and offensive remarks throughout, repeatedly mentioning sponsors PennyStockChaser.com and IHateStevenSinger.com.

A subsequent segment continued the chaotic interaction with the homeless guests, including Sandy Kane and Mustard.  Sandy Kane's claims of being picked up, cleaned, beaten, and having sex with strangers dominated the conversation, along with discussions of discarded food, Sandy's genitals, and her body odor, which E-Rock even smelled. Sandy attempted a song but struggled due to technical issues. Opie accidentally broke Sandy's guitar, leading to an angry outburst and negotiations. The segment concluded with a poorly executed Christmas carol, further body odor discussions, and a forced kiss between two guests for money.  Jim Florentine made brief appearances, plugging his stand-up shows.

The final segment involved a foot-related stunt with Opie and E-Rock, culminating in a kiss between Opie and another person. Mustard participated, placing his foot near Opie's face for E-Rock to smell.  A discussion about a donation to the homeless followed, with Steven Singer present and actively participating.  Singer was thanked profusely despite Opie's expressed dislike. The show concluded with a Burton snowboard giveaway, bizarre interactions with Singer ("Pop" was revealed to be Singer), and further discussion about the money donated to the homeless.  Vulgar language and sexually suggestive behavior continued throughout this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, devious.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of death.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.  Hi, I'm the Opie and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Test, test, test, test.  Good morning.  Sounds weird.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Live from the fishbowl.  This is the fishbowl.  We're still tinkering.  Hi.  We're still fiddling about.  Fiddle about.  There's some fiddling going on.  Can you hear me?  Oh, you sound weird.  Yeah, my mic sucks.  Well, it's just mics.  It's just mics. 
[00:01:30]  We don't really have to worry about that today.  Oh, no, we do.  Huh?  No, not really.  I want to welcome everyone to Radio 101.  It looks like we're in a classroom.  It does really look like a classroom.  The seat's set up.  And we're sitting kind of at a desk.  Like we're ready to give a seminar.  Yeah, I'm creeped out.  I haven't been in a classroom in years.  Yes, we're giving a class on how to make a company hate us.  I haven't been in one since the eighth grade.  What's that?  Are you even on?  Are you mic on, Rich?  Rich Voss is here. 
[00:02:00]  You've got to get right on these mics.  Huh?  You have to eat these mics.  Exactly.  Pretend it's coming through a hole in a restroom.  Pretend it's coming through a hole.  Rubbing it all over his face.  I like how they've set this up with, we have respirators and Lysol right in front of me,  as a matter of fact.  Well, you need it the most.  Of course I do.  I need volume, because I'm deaf.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we on a master control with the headphone machine.  Master.  Oh, no, no.  Let me see what this...  Does this do anything? 
[00:02:30]  Way too loud.  Wow.  Does this do anything?  It's way too loud.  It does.  But Jimmy is number...  Are you number four?  No.  No.  Sweetie Pie.  Are you number five, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do this.  Do this.  Talk.  Can you hear this?  Is it low?  It sounds the same to me.  Okay, then that's not it.  Let me try this one.  Is this you?  Yes, I don't know.  No, it sounds the same to me.  No, it's got to go up or down.  It's not doing anything.  My hearing's impeccable.  Don't fuck with me.  How about number four?  No, no, no.  Don't do...  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Turn it down!  Oh, what about three? 
[00:03:00]  Oh, I'm three.  You're three.  Okay, let's try two.  How appropriate.  I'm number two.  Are you two?  Turn it down.  That's off.  That's off.  I can still hear myself.  Are you number one?  How about this?  Can you hear yourself?  No, number...  I can't hear myself, Ant.  Now can you?  I can hear it too loud, Ant.  All right, now you're number one.  All right, cool.  So get every...  Opie, get comfortable with your volume.  Did Artie Lange shrink?  Wow, that is a good one.  Oh, visuals on the radio.  That's wonderful.  I'm going to make you guys laugh.  The guy who came in looks like Artie,  and that's what he's... 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, but we don't feel like having to explain your jokes  after the big...  I'm joking with you guys laugh.  Can you turn mine up a little bit, Ant?  Yeah, let me turn Jimmy up.  Yeah.  Here we go.  How's that?  I think that...  A little louder.  A little louder.  Oh, that's good.  That's good?  Yeah.  All right.  Everything's set up pretty good here.  I'm good now.  What about Rich?  I don't...  What?  You sound fine to me.  I sound fine?  What about Rich?  Rich?  Where do we start?  Where's my electrical?  Rich sounds very low in the mix.  I mean, trust me, we don't mind that whatsoever, but...  Yeah, believe me.  The audience doesn't either. 
[00:04:00]  Just in case someone with...  Listen, first of all...  ...skills wants to use that mic,  we want to make sure they have a good mic to use.  I'm fucking skilled.  I'll say.  I'm fucking skilled.  And...  Huh?  Well, these guys fiddle about it.  I got to go to Rich right away.  He went and saw Julie...  No, I rented Julia...  Julia.  Oh!  Why would you rent that?  You fruit!  What an asshole, asshole.  Why would you rent that?  Well, one, I love Meryl Streep.  God.  Why do you love Meryl Streep?  Okay.  I don't know if she's a good actress or stuff, 
[00:04:30]  but this one I think she's a little over...  She's not a good actress.  She's not a good actress.  Did you see Iron Weed?  She's not a good actress.  No, and Nicholson, very overrated.  Tom Waits.  Not a good movie, but I mean, she's very overrated.  Very overrated.  Are you kidding?  Compared to who?  She's very overrated.  I mean, she's no Parker Posey, but she's Meryl Streep.  Well, we know how much I love your Parker Posey.  Meryl Streep is not overrated.  She takes a character and...  Rich, I was kidding.  I don't care if she's a good actress.  That was the worst description of a great actress by Sonny in show business. 
[00:05:00]  What did I say?  She's a great actress because she takes a character and just...  I mean, you just ran out of steam.  I said makes it believable.  Exactly.  It's an awful...  That's great.  That's the way my aunt would describe Meryl Streep.  I know, and I always try to get her out of the house before she does it.  Why'd you rent the Julia movie?  Because the night before we saw a violent movie,  and the next night we wanted to watch something...  No, you wanted to watch Julia, Julia.  I have no doubt in my mind. 
[00:05:30]  Bonnie probably wanted to watch the violent movie,  and then you said, it's my turn.  Let's rent Julia, Julia.  Julia, Julia.  Did you tear up at the end?  Yeah.  When she was making a flamb√© and her clit fell off?  Did you grab one of your...  Huh?  When I looked over at my wife, I started tearing up.  You're awful to Bonnie.  Yeah, so you grabbed one of your tampons and wiped your eyes?  What was the violent movie?  What was the violent movie?  Yeah.  Inglourious Bastards.  Oh, see?  It was too much reading. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, there were a lot of subtitles, so that must have annoyed him.  You didn't like the fact that the Jews were kicking some Nazi ass?  Well, because it's like a good movie that's based on a true story.  It's a fantasy?  What?  That's based on a true story.  Yes.  Defiance.  But this is...  Oh, that was good.  And that's based on a true story.  Tough Polish Jews in the woods, okay, killing people and surviving like we've been doing.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Okay, so we were in the woods before anybody else.  So now this one is not based on a true story because Hitler dies. 
[00:06:30]  See, he ruins the movie right there by kind of saying that.  I'm all leaking.  I think everybody knows.  Hey, can I ask you about this movie, though?  Why the subtitles?  I understand it's German.  Why can't they get people with German accents?  Well, there's...  I'm a fan of that, where instead of doing the subtitles, you're like, oh, he has a German accent.  That he's one of the bad guys.  Well, there's parts that are German and then parts that are English without the subtitles and things like that.  They kind of...  I've always enjoyed German movies, Nazi movies especially, that I could stop it right there. 
[00:07:00]  I've always enjoyed Nazi movies that have subtitles because you like hearing that authentic German language.  It's very mean and nasty sounding.  Right when I heard it, I ran and hid under the bed.  Did you hear me?  He could have stood under the bed.  He packed his bags and got on a boxcar.  Did you see the movie?  Yes.  The guy that played the SS interrogator was great.  He was a hard-ass one.  He was fucking great.  The initial scene where he walks into the guy's farm and... 
[00:07:30]  I didn't see it.  It was one of the...  He is...  He'll sell it on the plane.  He is a real prick.  I know.  He was...  How come...  And some of those guys that had some of the great German accents, why didn't they get them to play Valkyrie instead of...  Oh, it was all English accents.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Heil Hitler then.  All right then.  Heil Hitler.  Didn't Cruz not do an accent for that?  Yeah, he just said fuck it.  I wonder if that's because he figures when you speak German, you don't hear a German accent,  so this is how you would hear it naturally if you were German.  Is that the...  Why wouldn't he do an accent? 
[00:08:00]  Then how come all the other Germans were speaking in an English accent?  It was so distracting.  That's really terrible.  It's ridiculous.  He really was the only one?  Well, he was the only one speaking in a regular American accent, but then the Nazis were all  speaking in English accents.  It's like watching Coach Carter and they're speaking correctly.  You know what I mean?  It just completely throws you off.  Coach Carter?  I don't know.  What old man fucking reference?  Yeah, what that?  It's a basketball movie.  Is that like the White Shadow?  It's a basketball movie with Samuel Jackson.  It's a really lame basketball movie. 
[00:08:30]  The White Shadow was a terrible fucking show.  Oh, wasn't it?  They show them sometimes Ken Howard stinks.  He'd have been knifed and robbed.  Let's be real.  The nerdy black guys in Salami.  Oh, please.  Yeah.  What a horrible show.  Phony show that is.  But why don't we let him off the hook?  What's Julia Julia about?  Yeah, yeah.  Julia Julia.  Now, I'll give you the synopsis and then we'll see what he says about it.  You just say...  It's that stupid movie where some chick cooks all of Julia Child's recipes.  Yeah.  Great.  Why do you have to watch movies together as a couple? 
[00:09:00]  There are some movies that I'm like, you know what?  I don't want to see this movie.  So my girl goes and sees it with a friend of hers or something.  Because, one, if I watch a movie with Bonnie, I say that's quality time.  Quality time.  If she cries, I can rub her a little bit and say I was...  No, you wanted to watch the movie.  Did you enjoy it?  Because you said you liked Meryl Streep.  I do like Meryl Streep, but I didn't really enjoy that movie.  What was it about?  It was about food.  Because Julia Childs. 
[00:09:30]  Julia Childs.  It's just Julia Childs.  Huh?  It's just Julia Childs.  It's not Julia Childs.  I actually thought it was Julia Childs, too.  Is it Julia Childs?  Really?  Is it Childs?  It better be now.  Hold on.  I don't think it's Julia Childs.  I think it's Julia Childs.  It's Childs.  I think Childs.  If anybody should know about young girls, it would be you.  I just know that child, Julia.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I'm mistaken.  Hold on.  I think it's Julia Childs. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Let's look it up.  Let's talk to the fucking semi-retarded guys and listeners who are Julia Childs.  Hey, retarded listeners.  Just perk this up.  Someone says Child.  All right.  That's one.  Child.  That's two.  It's Child.  I see.  Children.  Shut up.  No, I think it is Julia Child.  I don't think it's Julia Childs.  You're right.  Julia Childs.  There you go.  Thank you.  Why would Anthony?  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  I wish our students were here in the seats so I could have taught them how to handle a misstep 
[00:10:30]  online like that.  You see this audience?  This is what I look at every fucking weekend.  I'm sorry.  In case you were going to smash me again.  I'm sorry.  By accident, I cut you off.  I'm sorry.  All right.  It's officially Julia Childs.  I went to Julia Childs.  I went to Julia Childs.  Okay.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  What were you saying?  Why would you side with me?  That's what you were saying.  No.  Over Anthony.  Why would I side with anybody over Anthony on a point like that? 
[00:11:00]  I know.  Just do your stupid empty comedy club joke.  Oh, no.  It's not.  I feel bad for you.  Jesus.  Talk about the empty seats again and how every weekend you play to the blah, blah.  This is not how we broadcast.  I just want to.  I'm not going to bitch today because it's the last day before.  This is fine.  This is fine.  I don't mind this.  We don't want chairs like this.  You just have people in the corner standing.  You know what?  It's too organized.  Standing, though, dude, they'll be all fucked up.  This is OCD shit.  They'll be all fucked up.  At least they had bleachers at the other place. 
[00:11:30]  This is going to be interesting.  I think they're all going to turn their seats a little bit.  Of course.  Then there'll be somebody sitting behind somebody that's tall and not be able to see anything  because there's no incline on the seats.  There's no audience that's tall.  They're all going to be wide.  What's going to happen is you're going to have to space those seats out.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  They're much too close together.  Those are my two seats.  I was going to say, I think the audience bought two seats ahead of time. 
[00:12:00]  They surrounded us with these signs.  I understand that we're going to do something unpleasant, but they could have one of the  signs gone while it's just us broadcasting with our fans.  So we can just kind of see something?  Are they linked together?  I don't know.  At least there's the Opie and Anthony show.  There's like an Opie and Anthony show sign so they know what's going on.  It's facing us.  That's kind of nice.  So we know who we are.  Yes.  So I know who you are.  No, whatever.  It's whatever.  It's actually a good little facility to broadcast in.  By the way, there's a guitar here, and it's signed, and I want to know, are we going 
[00:12:30]  to have bums playing a signed guitar?  Yes.  Who signed this?  Bums.  I don't know.  Pick it up.  See if you can recognize the signature.  Oh, Paul Bond.  Rock forever.  Paul Bond.  John, rock forever.  Paul McCanty.  Paul McCanty.  If that's a Paul McCanty.  Hold on.  John Lannan.  Roberto Plunt.  See? 
[00:13:00]  I suck at making up names.  Let's just keep going.  Aussie Osborne.  Jimmy Kendricks.  Get it?  What happened?  What?  It happened.  What do you think of Tiger Woods there, Rich Voss?  You're a golfer.  Ah, why aren't people tired of it already?  Leave the kid alone, so he banged a couple white girls.  What's the difference?  Exactly.  Exactly.  They're the sinners.  That's right.  How could you not?  If you're a girl, too. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, those coal burners.  That's what they call.  Oh, it's terrible.  That's what they call white girls that are into black guys.  They call them coal burners.  I call them sellouts and traitors.  I call them my daughters.  Wow.  That was a good one.  Wow, he's right.  Hey, I was enjoying Jimmy strumming the guitar.  That was kind of nice.  Pete Correale.  Could you give us a little something?  Pete Correale is trying to play guitar. 
[00:14:00]  Pete did the funniest fucking joke.  Because he's trying to play guitar.  He goes, playing guitar is so hard.  If I didn't see other people do it, I wouldn't think it could be done.  Fucking death.  All right.  Jimmy's going to...  That's a funny observation.  I think everyone's tried at some point to play the guitar.  And then it's just...  Look how he holds the guitar.  You're holding it like Jose Feliciano.  Exactly.  I mean, he was blind.  He didn't know any better.  He could do a lot worse.  Yeah.  Jose Feliciano.  I could point it like that, like Johnny Cash would do.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  That's all I do. 
[00:14:30]  You just do an open...  Yeah.  Listen, I...  And then I stop and I talk.  That's how I do my whole act.  That's good.  Guys who have, like, musical instruments and don't play them.  You should do that.  Just strum along, man.  I wish I could play the guitar.  I would just sing to my girlfriend all the time.  Serenade her.  Don't be such a cunt.  It's only 6 a.m.  He's writing a fucking nagging text on the way to work.  He didn't say goodbye to me.  He didn't say goodbye to me.  Sorry. 
[00:15:00]  I'm not going to Vietnam, shit.  Don't be such a cunt.  It's only 6 a.m.  He didn't say goodbye to me.  Bye.  Hey, shit.  This is Christ.  Sorry I didn't fucking turn you over and kiss morning breath on the teeth.  Oh, you're lucky I didn't smother you with a pillow.  You cunt.  On 6 a.m. 
[00:15:30]  You didn't say goodbye to me.  You didn't say goodbye to me.  Oh, that is...  I'm going to work.  I don't have a fucking suitcase with me.  I'm coming back.  In a mere couple of hours.  And then meanwhile, if I turn over by, she'll say bye, and then I'll get a text an hour later.  I'm still awake.  Oh, really?  Maybe I should have made you a cup of coffee before I left, and you could have fucking sipped that,  and you could have texted while I was in the cab, and then you could have dozed back off.  Why are you giving up on your song?  I haven't thought that my fingers hurt already. 
[00:16:00]  They really do.  Yeah, I can't.  I don't know how guys...  I'd hate to be fingered by a guitarist.  They get calluses that build up, but before that, you're like, your fingertips bleed.  I don't know.  I got city hands from counting money all my life.  Exactly.  I got to play guitar.  That's right.  You're strumming like a blind Puerto Rican, Mr. Hooper.  Play me some classical music.  Yes, change the Star Spangled Banner.  They're going to kill you and dodge your stadium, Mr. Hooper.  Oh, that can be the biggest laugh of the week.  That's a good one.  Oh, my God.  That's classic.  So, Steve, we have audience? 
[00:16:30]  We sure do, Jim.  Oh, what's going on on the audience front?  I know the bum front is pretty good.  Yeah, we got some...  I think we're chock full of bums.  Give me an update on that.  Keith was able to round up some people.  He is a homeless wrangler.  Did he get mustard?  Yeah, he got mustard.  He got...  Is mustard all fucked up today?  Or do we get a good mustard or a bad mustard?  Homeless, and he's a drunk.  He's got to be.  It's hard to say.  He didn't really give me an update as to their status, but he did say that one of their names  was Crazy Motherfucker. 
[00:17:00]  Crazy Motherfucker.  Well, it's spelled with a K.  That's the original Nordic.  Okay, that makes sense.  Nordic.  Because, of course, I've got to put all of their names into the security system to get  them all up.  Crazy Motherfucker has to be put in there.  So, Crazy Motherfucker is in the security system.  I hope he has ID.  Yeah, he does.  Plus one.  It's Crazy Motherfucker plus guess.  But, uh...  Damn ID.  It's his schizo personality.  Nutty cunt will be along later.  You know, she's having a latte and she's returning a library book.  It's so fucking cold out this morning.  You'll know if they're homeless. 
[00:17:30]  How cold is it?  What, you think you're dealing with rookies?  It's so cold my slobber froze.  I get icicles on my teeth.  Take that shit to an improv.  We're doing real shit here today.  I was just saying how cold...  How do you rephrase that without you fucking douchebags?  With my mouth, I turned an icicle into a snow cone.  Well, how cold is it, Ray?  How cold is it, Ray?  How cold is it?  How do I follow that? 
[00:18:00]  How do I follow you three fucking stung eggs?  How cold is it?  It's so cold, I had to put on a child's jacket from the ghetto in 1999.  That jacket makes me sick.  I want to throw eggs at it.  Yeah, apparently he brought in a deaf comedy jam...  What's this deaf comedy jam jacket?  Jacket that...  Fat Farm.  Fat Farm.  It's actually a nice jacket.  Thank you.  And Opie put it where it belongs.  Opie just hurled it onto the floor.  Now we have an audience member.  Oh, Rich. 
[00:18:30]  Wait a minute.  Oh, you know what?  Come on, Rich.  What are you doing?  All just having fun.  The day before a big holiday.  Rich picking up his jacket.  You have a hat like Sean Connery in The Untouchables, and I hope you have an ending like he does.  What?  That jacket sucks.  For you, it's not nice.  I don't like it.  It's too old school.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  I was...  How about a mic?  Yeah, Rich.  You're just yelling into thin air.  School school.  I didn't want to bring my rabbit for a hoodie, because I thought you guys would hurt it. 
[00:19:00]  We would make fun of it, too.  So...  And nerve you to dress like fucking...  This is my second warmest coat right now.  You hear, Rich?  So how cold was it?  Mm-hmm.  Whew.  Cold.  Very good.  I tipped the guy that fixed my car.  Are you supposed to tip the guys that fix your car?  No, you're not.  Yeah.  What, do you throw the Jiffy Lube guy at 50?  No, my...  They've...  I got a new engine.  My whole...  What are you doing?  Exactly.  I got a new car at that point.  I know.  Well, I didn't have to pay.  I had the fucking extended warranty. 
[00:19:30]  Let's get...  It would have cost $18,000 for the engine.  What are you...  What are you fucking driving?  The Challenger?  Fucking Hyundai.  18 Gs for an engine.  Well, the whole...  For a Porsche, that's what it is.  What happened to it?  I was driving...  You needed the entire engine repaired.  Well, no, I need to replace...  You replaced it.  How many miles?  What?  Did you push on it?  My engine or your girl?  No, my girl has an endless amount of miles, but I mean the Porsche.  There was 65,000, and I was driving...  When you got it?  No, when I was clunking, and then all of a sudden I stopped, and oil started pouring out. 
[00:20:00]  Right?  I thought I was fucking squeezing your hair.  It just started pouring out, and then all of a sudden they rebuilt the fucking engine.  So it would have been $1,800.  $18,000.  How much did you tip the guy?  I gave one guy $60,000, $140,000, and $130,000.  In order of what?  Ethnicity?  How did that work?  Yeah, really?  What do you do?  Well, the main guy there, I gave him $60,000, and then the other guy that helps him, I  gave him $40,000, and the guy behind the counter that writes up the bill, I gave him $30,000. 
[00:20:30]  What did they say happened?  They said something blue in there.  Your CD?  Oh, damn.  We should take up a collection and get him a car.  Are you kidding me?  I have a brand new fucking engine.  Oh, great.  Now your transmission's going to go.  I hope so.  I hope so.  When did you buy one of those, like, what year is it?  It's a 2003.  So you must have bought an extended warranty. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, I said I bought the extended warranty.  I said I bought the extended warranty, and I guess you upped it by going, I must have.  I didn't, I wasn't listening to what you were saying at that point.  I bought the extended warranty, and it was up to 75,000 miles, but then when I talked to the guy on the phone, he knew me, so he bumped it up to 108,000 miles.  But I mean, I still would have been covered.  Yeah, I'm hoping the trans goes.  Then the rear end will go.  What's that?  Then the rear will go.  You ought to just buy a new car. 
[00:21:30]  Guys, we got our first Rich is an Idiot phone call.  Oh, cool.  And we can see if the phone works.  What's up, Bonnie?  God, you're on the phone.  What's up, Bonnie?  God, you're on the phone.  That's good.  And Bonnie is good, too.  Brian in Utah, what's up?  Or Utica.  Utica, Brian.  Utica.  Okay.  Good evening.  Good evening, Brian.  Yeah, Rich, man, you're a freaking idiot, dude.  A freaking?  I'm going to say it caused 18 Gs for a Porsche motor, man.  Come on, dude.  I sell Porsches up here in upstate New York. 
[00:22:00]  But it don't cost 18 Gs for a new motor.  No, you fucking.  First of all.  My buddy has tractor trailers.  He's got his own business, all right?  He turns them over.  He builds new ones every three or four years.  He trades his old motor in for a brand new five-year remanufactured motor.  The motors for a tractor trailer, we're talking 600 horsepower diesel motors don't even cost 15 grand.  What are you smoking, you freaking horse-tooth faggot? 
[00:22:30]  First of all, am I talking to a lady in misery?  You can curse, you freaking idiot.  It would have been probably 18 or 16 with all the work and everything.  But it doesn't matter.  It didn't cost me a penny because I had a warranty.  You fucking sold me.  The guys at Porsche could have said, hey, this costs $50,000.  It doesn't matter because I didn't pay anything.  So who's the idiot?  Hold it.  We just crossed the who gives a shit mark in this conversation.  Yeah, I know.  I just know.  But you're the one who just crossed over it.  You're the one who lets this fucking idiot through. 
[00:23:00]  I didn't.  We just wanted to test the phones.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we didn't give a shit about his caller.  We realized that the phones had to be turned up a little.  I believe they did it inside on the board.  You fucking guys are pros.  Yeah, of course.  We just used you and that caller.  Well, you didn't use me.  I'm here anyhow.  Are you?  Where's Keith the cop?  Is he coming?  Yeah, he's on the phone.  He's got the homeless downstairs.  What does E-Rock have?  E-Rock?  Nothing.  You don't have anything?  He's stricken with a case of obesity.  Oh, shit. 
[00:23:30]  Poor E-Rock.  I'm sorry.  Chicago's quarterback hairdo.  Thanks, Mitch.  Don't make the joke if you don't know the guy's name.  Chicago's what era?  What's his name with the dead eye?  David Patterson?  Oh.  I said eye, not eyes.  You're going back to McMahon?  Yeah.  Sandy Duncan?  Forrest Whitaker?  Going back to, he just did a McMahon joke.  Well, what's wrong with it?  Sandy Davis?  It wasn't a crack.  It was a compliment.  The Chicago Bears have probably had 15 quarterbacks since then. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, since you're right.  Jim McMahon reference?  Jim McMahon reference.  You best not be doing a Jim McMahon reference.  That's exactly what he did.  Are you doing a Super Bowl shuffle era reference?  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  Wow.  Who's this guy?  I think he is.  William the Refrigerator.  Boo.  Ah, boo.  Wow.  Look at his Bart Star hair.  You leave Dick Buckus alone.  No one knows who Dick Buckus is.  What happened?  There's a tea in there.  Exactly.  It's actually pretty good, because Dick has a haircut like that, too. 
[00:24:30]  Yes, he does.  Very good, Rich.  Oh, my God.  Let's attack Voss.  I'm not attacking Voss.  I'm not attacking Voss.  I'm not attacking Voss.  You looked at him, Rocky, and he said he looks like the guy from Chicago.  No, I didn't say that.  Dennis Franz?  Yes.  What pill are you popping?  He just got nervous and pulled out a pill or something.  Are you all right?  What is this?  What is that?  Is it nitroglycerous?  It's a sialis.  That's funny.  It's a sialis so his tongue hardens.  He doesn't tip on his words.  He just got nervous and pulled something out of his pocket.  What was that? 
[00:25:00]  Nicorette gum.  Nicorette gum.  Who's Nicorette?  Would he be really jonesing?  Blow a smoker.  When you want to quit smoking, chew gum for 10 straight years.  How long has it been since you smoked a cigarette?  Three and a half years.  And you've been on this gum for three and a half years.  It's great because you could fall asleep with it in your mouth.  Oh, that's good.  Do you?  Sometimes.  Wow.  And you wake up and it turns like green on a pillow so you think your face has syphilis  because I drool on the pillow. 
[00:25:30]  I don't doubt that.  Of course not.  You drool everywhere.  You drool on the circuitry.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  It's so good.  Yeah.  It's not good.  I hear every piece of that gum say, why me, when it goes into his mouth.  You should get off the gum.  Well, you know.  I should what?  Get off the gum.  I mean, I'm on.  Yeah.  That's a new habit.  Yeah.  You just traded one habit for another, Rich.  Yeah, you absolutely did.  And is nicotine healthy for you like that? 
[00:26:00]  I mean.  Oh, yeah.  All the athletes are doing it.  I mean.  Before a game.  But you're trading.  I understand it's better than the smoke.  Yeah.  But isn't it still harmful?  I would believe, you know, nicotine, as much as you have it in the gum every day, it's  got to be harmful.  A little bit.  These are four milligrams a piece.  So say I do 12, 12 a day.  That's 48 milligrams.  I have no idea what that means.  One cigarette has nine milligrams.  And I was smoking three packs a day.  That's 60 times nine is 540 milligrams. 
[00:26:30]  I was taking them nicotine a day.  Was that right?  As you're talking, your head should explode like scanners.  Did you see him pause?  Nothing comes out of it.  It's like a balloon popping.  It's confetti.  You guys missed the best part, though.  After he did that little...  What?  Did he leave?  After he did that equation, he paused because he thought we'd be impressed that he was able  to multiply.  At his math skills?  65.  I saw what you did.  90.  Yeah.  You pause like that.  I'm good.  Nine times 60 is 540. 
[00:27:00]  By the way, Sherlock Holmes is now a movie.  Sherlock Holmes.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, I'm not really into that.  What about Avatar?  Robert Downey Jr.?  Those kind of movies do nothing for me.  A movie like Avatar.  What?  Oh, really?  A science fiction movie with flying monsters?  Really?  That would be good.  It's 3D.  It might be done.  If it's done well, it'd be great.  Three and a half stars.  It's cutting edge.  Amazing.  Why don't you stop trying to be so realistic?  You're not realistic.  I saw Star Trek and I thought it was okay.  It was.  It was great.  It wasn't good.  And because the guy from Heroes was in it, that's what made the movie Spock. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  You know.  That's it.  You know, I see a lot of movies.  I bet you do.  I do a lot of movies.  Hey, uh...  I put them on my iPhone now.  Oh, that's good.  That's what you want to do.  Fucking watch a movie that's made for the big screen on a fucking stamp.  That's good.  I have a viewfinder.  I zip through them.  What's the matter with Joe?  That big laptop.  Hey, any of our guys here?  Like Bobo or Stalker Patty?  Oh, sure.  Pat from Minaki.  Yeah, we could get a few of our regulars in.  I saw a few in the back. 
[00:28:00]  Like there was a...  Oh, here's Sambo.  Oh, Sam.  Sambo.  I'm glad we still get to see him run.  Hi, Sambo.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  How are things?  Very well.  How about you guys?  Good.  Good.  The show sounds like a million bucks so far.  Great.  Well, Jay Thomas.  Jay Thomas, everybody.  Jay Thomas, right there.  There's Jay walking past the studio.  Fucking Mork and Mindy.  Yeah, he was in Mork and Mindy.  No, he wasn't.  Yes, he was.  Yeah, he was.  Was he?  Who did he play?  Who did he play?  Jay Thomas.  In Mork and Mindy?  No.  Why don't you ask him?  He's right there.  He was in Mork and Mindy.  I didn't know that.  I remember the show.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  I believe something Janus was in there.  He was on a few.  Wasn't he on Cheers also?  He certainly was on Cheers.  Yes, he was.  I think he was on Murphy Brown, too.  Murphy Brown, the guy.  Oh, a little show called Murphy Brown.  I didn't know that.  Is he an actor or do you play a radio guy?  No, he's an actor.  No, he's like, yeah, he does.  Sam, but what do you got?  Well, so far, the only real main talent, as far as our guests go, Bobo is here.  Of course he is.  Stalker Patty, Big A, and my special booking have not arrived yet. 
[00:29:00]  Your special booking?  Yes.  Are you keeping this secret?  I mean, it's a big surprise.  Wow.  I can only imagine what wrestler it is.  It's not a wrestler.  No?  Nick Foley.  All right.  Oh, wow.  So, all right.  So, they're coming.  Where's Keith and where's the audience?  The audience, most of the audience is here.  They're right outside.  Okay.  We'll keep them there.  Keith and Danny are still en route.  Okay, they're coming.  Yes.  With the homeless.  Yes.  How hard is it to just, I could just see them in a van pulling up, opening the door, 
[00:29:30]  just grabbing them.  Hey, would you help me with this couch?  Would you?  You want to get locked up or sing for money?  All right.  Exactly.  Just sweeping the city.  It is now, yeah, we should start.  Yeah, we're going to take a break.  And what about audience members?  Are they being processed as we speak?  Yes, they are being processed.  I like that word.  Are we going to have all 24 seats taken?  Not yet.  Are they all being processed? 
[00:30:00]  So far, we will have 15 of the 24 seats.  It'll fill up by the time.  This is just some lazy guests.  And that's because we weren't allowed to overbook, right?  You know what, though?  Let me tell you something.  If 15 seats are filled and there's another 10 that can be filled, I'm sure if we just go, hey, come, that we'll find 10 people.  There's three people in the standby room, too.  Oh, okay.  Which is your studio.  Standby room.  So we do have standbys.  We have three in the standby room and 15 on the main list. 
[00:30:30]  It's early yet.  It's very early.  It's early.  Settle down.  You're not going to get a problem from me today.  Have some breakfast.  A lot of your audience doesn't get up yet.  No, they're up.  What do you think this is?  Hot 97?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a black joke.  The morning show is starting at noon.  I'll be explaining this.  Richard's going to be my muse today.  Do you like Muse?  The movie? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, forget it.  I watch it every night.  It keeps me informed.  What's down in the stone?  No, there's a band called Muse.  I don't know.  I've never heard of them.  You should check them out.  They're pretty good.  Will they play this week at Scotty's in Springfield with me?  Oh!  Springfield where?  Springfield, New Jersey.  Yeah, there's plenty of Springfields all over the country.  Oh, I know Springfield.  I really know Springfield, man.  Rich Voss is coming to see us.  Springfield, New Jersey.  I know there was a Springfield, New Jersey. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  I know there's a Springfield, Massachusetts.  One of your workers lives right by there.  Who?  Well, I don't want to give his name and his location, but one of your workers lives right  by.  Why?  Because it's going to be a Beatles workers situation where everyone's going to be.  Is it communism?  Chasing them down the fucking street?  Who?  Your audience doesn't chase people.  What are you kidding me?  No, they flee me.  Who lives in Springfield, New Jersey?  Hey.  What's it?  I'll tell you off the air.  He can't remember the name.  What is it?  The guy from Chicago.  So, at Scottie's this weekend. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, write it down.  I sit in the area.  No, because if I write it down, you're going to snitch.  Why are you pretending?  What is this guy?  A mobster?  He is.  He's a snitch.  What are you doing?  Isn't he part of our show?  Yes.  So, who?  What the?  I think Danny Ross is in the building.  Ah!  Is that your special booking?  No, no, no, no.  We bring the homeless in after the listeners.  That's obvious.  Richard, are you giving up? 
[00:32:30]  Ah, there's Danny staggering down the hallway.  Danny doesn't look happy.  What's the matter, Dan?  You're right, Dan.  We're in a good mood.  Everything go good?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just tired.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  We're in a pretty good mood.  We got some homeless.  We got quality homeless.  There's one guy.  He's like this crazy Filipino guy.  He's just been talking to himself in the van since we picked him up, and there were some  instances where Keith had to leave the van, and I'm just left in the van with this  psychotic.  Oh, good.  He's talking to himself.  He's talking about going to the moon, being in outer space, and he's just giggling. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, great.  Yeah.  I really like this guy.  It's going to be great to be homeless.  It's near Armstrong.  Yeah, this guy does never care in the world.  Yeah.  What do you call him?  I can't remember.  It's made fun of him.  Scuzz Aldrin.  It's got to be good to be homeless, man.  Not a worry in the world.  Like Danny was saying.  You can just talk to yourself.  He's laughing.  No, buzz all day. 
[00:33:30]  Buzz all day.  Alan smells like a wet German shepherd.  All right.  It's long, but it ends with shepherd.  What happened?  These guys just got here.  Keith has them all rounded up.  We got mustard?  We have mustard.  Mustard.  We have mustard and mustard's boyfriend.  Puss.  Puss Grissom.  That's good.  Kevin from Connecticut.  I like that one.  You guys forgot that mustard blew everyone away with his music.  Yes.  And he came back today with his boyfriend, Boris. 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  Apparently, he's in an alternative relationship.  His boyfriend's name is Boris.  Unlike Voss, who is Boris, it's very close.  See?  Get it?  Voss, would you lick a homeless guy's ass for Coke?  Would I?  No.  I never thought about that.  Lick a homeless guy's ass.  Back in the old days, you probably would have.  No, I wouldn't.  No.  What if the line was right on his tailbone?  Yeah.  I smoked him.  Pussies snorted. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You got to do both.  Can we do homeless gay sex today?  Snort?  You smoke?  Snorting is reading a book backwards.  Snorting was fun.  Numbed your whole face up.  Right?  Fuck.  Like that?  No.  Once you smoke it, you don't step back and snort it.  That's like reading a book backwards.  What the fuck?  How would you know?  Wow.  Just nonstop.  Holy shit.  He makes it easy, though.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So the homeless are here.  Any other observations as you guys were driving around picking them up? 
[00:35:00]  Well, how did you find these guys?  In what state?  And what about...  Were they on sidewalks?  What about odors and stuff?  They stink.  Oh, okay.  They really do stink.  The second mustard and his boyfriend got in the van, it was over.  Why?  All right.  Here's what's going to have to happen then, and I have to say this immediately.  I will need my sandwich ASAP.  Yeah, I agree.  Before the homeless come in here, because I will not be able to eat in that stench.  Can I get some food?  You know, we were in Beverly Hills last week. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, were you?  Oh, it sounds like a sitcom waiting to happen.  I saw a homeless guy there.  Like, a homeless guy in Beverly Hills is like having an apartment in Albany.  You know what I mean?  This fucking...  They were doing pretty well.  There was homeless guys there.  We understand.  In fucking suits and stuff.  Pretty goddamn well, that's all I'm saying, when I was at the Beverly Hilton last week.  Yeah.  And not only that, when I was at the Beverly Hilton, one night they were honoring Steven Spielberg  downstairs, and they had all these celebrities and fucking Katzenberg and Drew Barrymore and 
[00:36:00]  the guy that sang Adam Lambert and tons of them, and I went down to meet them.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You didn't tell us you were working as a waiter.  That's right.  Whoa, whoa.  Oh, my God.  Look who's having them now, too.  I've had a few races.  That's not fucking bad.  All right, so you went to meet them, and what happened?  And then I went upstairs to change, and I laid down, and I fell asleep and missed the  whole function.  That's what I'm saying.  I knew there was a bad ending to that story.  I missed Spielberg and all of them.  Greatest setup with no ending right there. 
[00:36:30]  What do you mean I would have gotten near him?  What are you kidding me?  I'm Rich Fox.  Exactly.  Then some guy came up to me, and he's talking.  This is a true story.  And he's asking me questions.  I go, what are you doing here?  He goes, I'm with some other fucking, you know, what do they call it when groups get  together?  You know, a convention, right?  He's with some convention.  Dave's talking.  He asked me what I do, and I told him.  He goes, oh, my sister's a comic.  So his sister is a comic.  She emails me, and I find out her brother was security, and he was sizing me up. 
[00:37:00]  He wasn't with the fucking convention.  He was like a fucking...  Like Secret Service almost.  Yeah, he was like a Secret Service dude.  Fucking with you.  And I was just fucking standing there, so they thought I was undesirable.  Like Travis Bickle.  That's what you...  See?  That's how it was.  You talk to the guy, you think he's your pal, and he's writing your name down.  What?  Well, there you have it.  You lost two out of three guys.  You know that, Rich, right?  What are you talking about?  Jimmy phased out, and so did I.  What happened? 
[00:37:30]  To what?  Exactly.  What were you talking about?  Getting a new engine.  Oh, okay.  Let's get back.  That's where it all started.  I think it's time to take a break.  Here's Keith the cop.  Maybe Keith could give us an update before we break.  Keith.  Hi, Keith.  Morning.  You were in my house.  You left a little hit message.  God damn, man.  What happened?  I fell asleep on the couch yesterday when I got home.  Yeah.  And I woke up, and there's a note that says, bang, you're dead, and I raped your corpse's ass. 
[00:38:00]  I said, why?  He's got a great relationship.  I know.  I came over.  Do you want to sing a song to him?  A linger an hour ago.  I was throwing the garbage out and everything, and then I looked through the window, and I  saw your feet, so I wanted to make sure you were at least alive.  I came in.  You didn't hear me come in at all, so I just wrote, you know, and I wrote, bang, you're  dead.  I stole all your shit, and I fucked your dead carcass.  I know.  I felt very violated.  Yeah.  Good thing you put in that security system. 
[00:38:30]  Doing wonders.  I know.  Was the door unlocked, too?  I think it was.  Jesus.  And then, oh my God.  And then, here's what else happened.  Yeah.  I don't even know what time it was.  I was on and off sleeping from like noon until 2.30 this morning.  Wow.  On the couch, just, you know, I'd change the channels a few times.  So, the doorbell rings.  It's dark out.  I don't even know what time it is.  So, I look up at the door, and I see an African American at my door standing. 
[00:39:00]  You know, I can see it through the glass.  So, I'm like, all right.  I got to answer the door.  I don't want to see my...  I go, just a minute.  I went upstairs.  I came to the door.  Like, I was going to open the door and be lazy, and just go like, all right, what are the odds?  You know, I'll just open the door and stuff.  But I thought better of it, and I made him wait at the door while I locked and loaded.  Good.  And I opened the door. 
[00:39:30]  It was a UPS guy.  He was delivering clubbies present to me, and I had to sign a little computer thing he held,  and he said, thank you, happy holidays.  And I'm like, okay, thank you.  You almost took one.  You know, you got to watch yourself, though.  That's a prime example of just kind of, you know, flugging out.  If he was white, would you have done this?  I absolutely would have.  I just brought up the fact that anyone that rings the bell that I don't know is going  to be greeted at the door by me, perhaps, you know, protecting myself. 
[00:40:00]  That's all I'm saying.  How's Mustard and the gang?  They're sleepy.  A little groggy.  If you had a good night's sleep in three years, you'd be a little tired.  We got one guy, in all honesty, I don't even know what the fuck his name is.  He's just an absolute lunatic.  Is he the guy, yeah, because Danny was telling us about the guy that talks to himself?  Oh, yeah.  So he's just in outer space and stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  I love this guy already.  I mean, it took him 25 minutes. 
[00:40:30]  We sat there while he crawled out of his, you would have never found this guy.  Like, he had three of those big orange construction things in front of this box that he had up  against the wall.  Because I'm standing on the corner, and I'm talking.  He has a cell phone, though.  So I call him on his cell phones.  I don't know.  And I'm talking to him, and he's telling me where he is.  And I'm standing on the corner, and I'm like, I don't see you.  I don't.  And he goes, no, in the box.  In the box.  That is the oddest thing.  What a world we live in.  I'm looking around, and I see the three. 
[00:41:00]  And it was very neat.  You would have never known that there was a...  And I think there was a...  A neat box?  A neat box.  And it took him 25 minutes to get dressed, and...  Did he lock his door?  He set his alarm.  With a magic marker.  Yeah, he drew a lock.  Oh, that's horrible.  He did have a...  He has a bicycle, and he wanted to bring the bicycle.  I said, you can't bring the bicycle.  Bring the bike.  Oh, I hope it's still there.  He did have a lock, but it wasn't chained to anything, and he just put it on the bicycle,  and he's like, okay, it's good. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, that bike's so gone.  Oh, you know it is.  All right, cool.  Why don't we take a break and meet the homeless guys next?  Wade, no, I want to eat first.  All right.  Can we have the audience ushered in?  Yeah, we'll have the...  And then talk to some of them, maybe?  Yeah, all right.  And then the homeless...  Sure, why not?  Because if I don't eat before they come in here, I am not going to be able to fucking eat.  Why not?  Because they stink.  They smell bad.  You're eating in front of my career.  All right.  Self-deprecating truth.  I also want to ask you guys if you ever had a worse your underwear in the sink because 
[00:42:00]  you were embarrassed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I'm not the only one?  I actually do it in the shower.  Like, if I'm...  You take off your underpants?  If I'm disrobing before a shower, and I notice, like, oh, today was a little rough, I'll go  into the shower, and I'll take, you know, some soap and do the old Laura Ingalls down by  the river scrub thing.  I scrub it right in the sink.  I wring it out and just kind of throw it...  All right, good.  What the fuck is wrong with you two chimps? 
[00:42:30]  My asshole's immaculate.  It's because you're fucking, like, crazy about it sometimes.  Sometimes, if you're taking, like, a dump and things don't go well, you know, you might  have a little residual.  Never!  I'm not talking, you know, fucking pudding, underwear full of pudding.  I'm just talking...  Sometimes you'll get a little mark.  A little mark?  Mine look like an...  I mean, it's an old term, but a shoeshine rag.  A shoeshine rag.  It was horrendous, and I was embarrassed, and I was the only one home, and I was embarrassed.  You've never had any mark on the back of your drawers. 
[00:43:00]  I almost never, no.  Almost never.  Well, that's what I'm talking about.  It's not a daily occurrence that I'm laundering.  But you take it into the shower.  You make an event out of it.  You in the sink.  No, it's not an event.  It's because I notice when I take my undies off, sometimes you're like, I was a little  cranky today.  If you don't stick our fingers up our assholes.  Yes, exactly.  That's another thing.  I'd rather go in the shower with my underwear once every blue moon than shove my finger up  my ass with a tissue on it.  My asshole's immaculate.  I don't doubt it.  You could eat fucking potato salad out of my underpants.  Why would you?  I'm sure it's been hard.  I have, and it's delicious. 
[00:43:30]  I think Rick's just trying to say something.  What, Rick?  With Bob Levy's act?  I fucking...  Right, with the act.  You're so off mic.  No one's listening.  What do you mean, Bob Levy's act?  You said, eat it out of my ass.  First of all, if you guys are millionaires, throw out the fucking underwear and buy a new  pair.  Who gives a fuck?  Done that, too, my friend.  I fucking almost shit, I shit myself before I went on stage once.  Wait.  I fucking ate buffalo wings, and this one, I had a girlfriend years ago, and I fucking  got blown between shows, and I ate buffalo wings, and then I'm getting ready to be introduced, 
[00:44:00]  and I farted, and all of a sudden, I hear squirt, right?  And I got like fucking, all of this hot girls looking at me as I'm telling stories how I shit  myself.  How do you do that in front of her?  She's like a 12.  Oh, yeah.  That's age.  And I fucking ran in the bathroom, fucking took them off, and threw them in the garbage,  and went on stage with like fucking mushy ass, you know what I mean?  Like the fucking harmless.  You didn't clean up in the bathroom?  It was as quick as I could, but not like I liked to.  We called it swamp ass. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah, swamp ass.  Everyone understands.  Oh, Jimmy's got a song.  No, no, I don't.  No, Jimmy, you got a song.  I'm highlighting Rich's story with this.  No, Jimmy, you got a song.  I see.  You want to play the guitarist.  Highlight it with a jackhammer so we can't hear him.  Can you improv a song about Rich, please?  We just need to take a break, I think.  Yeah.  Jimmy doesn't give you much.  Just a little piece of his talent in his songs.  Just a little bit, a little something about Rich.  All I have. 
[00:45:00]  That's fucking, that's a good song.  Thank you.  Yeah.  What about washing your underwear?  What can I say about that?  I'm actually just disgusted with the twoiest.  He doesn't do it.  I don't do it.  My underwear's immaculate.  It's once every fucking blue moon, like I said.  Once in a while.  Once every brown moon.  Once every brown moon.  Speak for yourself.  I don't know if it's every other day because I do a lot of biking.  Oh, I have to wash shit out of my underwear, but it's in the front.  All right.  We got to take our first break. 
[00:45:30]  It's already seven o'clock.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yes.  We're only doing another hour.  Sandwich stat.  Stat.  Stat.  We'll get the listeners in.  We'll get the homeless in.  We'll fuck around for a little bit, and then we leave you guys for a couple weeks.  Stay there.  Oh, this is pleasant.  Did we hit the button?  What?  Hi, everybody.  Opie and Anthony show.  It's the homeless talent show that we're doing here. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, it's all right.  It's the Friday before vacation.  Who cares, right?  Kenny is bringing us sweet treats.  Oh, Kenny.  Look at Kenny.  He's like a waiter.  Yes.  What have we got?  Chocolate chip cookies?  Oh.  Where'd they come from?  Just worried about you.  That's why I'm worried.  Where'd they came from before I eat them?  Thank you.  I'm welcome.  Hey.  Hey.  Rich was bragging about his hotel room, and he was playing audio of the... 
[00:46:30]  Oh.  What'd you say?  The radiator?  Yeah, the radiator.  Did we say radiator or radiator?  I happen to think that it radiates heat, so it's a radiator.  I say radiator.  It doesn't radiate heat.  Yeah.  But...  It goes either way.  Oh.  I'm not going to nitpick.  So listen to this.  Oh, now it doesn't work.  Could you basically...  Bottom of the phone to the mic.  Yeah.  You do understand the sound on an iPhone.  Algonquin.  Algonquin. 
[00:47:00]  This is me.  This is what I have to listen to right next to my bed trying to sleep.  Here's the heater.  Listen.  That's nice.  All night.  So I call the front desk.  Yeah.  I call the front desk, and I'm going, I can't sleep.  The guy goes, I'll send up earplugs.  It's a four-star fucking hotel.  They're used to the complaints, so they got a lot of earplugs.  I'll get earaches if I see you. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, that sucks, Rich.  What did it have?  An old steam radiator?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, fucking cooling system guy.  I don't fucking know.  Oh, you don't know if air blows out of a grill in the ceiling or the wall?  No, it was a baseboard.  It was a baseboard.  Then you weren't at a good hotel, then.  It's a four-fucking-star hotel.  It's got to be forced hot air coming in, or else you're going to hear clank, clank.  It should be just blowing in.  Was there a fucking red neon light that said, you know, bar, grill? 
[00:48:00]  I looked out the window, and I saw Lee Remick walking down the street.  And this guy, I have a reference that is earlier than maybe 30 or 40 years ago.  Lee Remick.  It was rattling like rosebud.  God, Rich.  You're just always cutting corners.  Really quickly, I just want to let you know.  You've got a hair like Mary Pickford.  I want to let you know that I did the right thing yesterday, 
[00:48:30]  and I took Stephen S. from Bayshore to an Islanders game.  Oh, he didn't sit with me, but I did get him to the Islanders game.  Why?  And I didn't let him drive with me.  Why didn't he sit with you?  I called him up last minute, and I said, good news.  You're going to the Islanders game.  And I sat him with my brother, the owner of FH Riley's.  Oh, okay.  So he had someone to sit with.  He wasn't just alone.  But we almost went to a game together.  I could see him across the ice.  Oh, you could?  Yeah, he was on the other side of the Coliseum.  So I just want to let you know, there's your update.  I did the right thing. 
[00:49:00]  Who won the game?  So we got Stephen Singer.  All right, Rangers won.  Stephen Singer's here with a beautiful assistant.  I know.  Yes.  Leanne.  What's her name?  Leanne.  Leanne.  I look at him, and I go, I'm a Jew, but he's like a Jew.  You can tell.  Like, if you go to those, like, Nazi training camps where they shoot at pictures of Jews  and blacks.  If.  Like, and I mean, there's nothing wrong with it, but he's definitely like, he's like a 
[00:49:30]  Jew to the third power.  He looks like Dave's dad.  What do you think you, you.  I don't look, I look like a fucking tough guy.  No, you don't.  Ew.  Stop.  Yeah, you look real tough.  He goes, stop.  I flicked my head.  He goes, stop.  He goes, stop.  All right, tough guy.  Instead of doing some kind of MMA move, he goes, stop.  Stop.  He looked tough eating that cookie.  Do I?  He's eating the cookie.  What are the odds that the Jew has fake $100 bills?  What are the fucking, that's a brilliant idea. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, how do you think I pay my serious bill?  They are.  Apparently so.  That's it?  I think other people have taken your lead.  That's why the stock is 60 cents.  He's got these fake Stephen Singer, like, $100 bills.  You don't know it's a Stephen Singer thing.  Yeah, you know, it looks like a $100 bill laying on the ground, and then you pick it up.  It really does.  And you unfold it, and it's not as long as a $100 bill, and it's got a little message  inside.  It says, I hate Stephen Singer.  I hate Stephen Singer.  It's driving Philly nuts.  Yeah, these things.  You should throw some of these around in New York.  Oh, yeah, we got them all over.  Oh, all over? 
[00:50:30]  We got people putting them all over the street.  Stephen Singer is a...  I would have to say our biggest sponsor at this point, right?  It's fucking great.  I think Stephen Singer is the guy.  He is the guy.  Well, can I tell you something?  We are so thrilled to be back on the air with you guys.  This is great.  Now that you guys are here, and you've got a home, even though they've got you trapped  here like a rat in a cage, they've got everything plastered up so nobody can see you back in  here.  It's a home, but it's like, I don't know, it's like Joan Crawford's home.  It's like an adopted child.  But listen, you're here.  No, we're going to do some renovation in 2010. 
[00:51:00]  And then this place will become our home.  These guys were the biggest thing in Philly, where I'm from, and they were kicking ass  and they were just too revolutionary for regular radio.  Oh, who are you talking about?  Stephen Singer was telling me off air, he's like, I was always frustrated by you guys  because I was into it.  The momentum was there, it was working, and the next thing you know, you guys are gone.  Every time something good happened, they pulled the plug.  And then you'd come back and the same thing would happen.  So now he's just paying attention to how long our contract is. 
[00:51:30]  That was how we negotiated the deal.  I asked him how long the contract was, and I said, that's how long I want my flight.  I booked the flight for that.  I said, if they're not here, I'm not here.  I said, don't screw me up again.  Now how am I supposed to hate Stephen Singer?  Oh, you'll hate me.  No, look, don't worry about that.  Spend the weekend with him.  That's it.  He's not a likable guy, you can tell, within five minutes.  Yeah, nobody likes me.  That's why I brought my hat assistant.  You should go further.  Insufferable prick, Stephen Singer. 
[00:52:00]  Mean, addictive prick.  That bastard, Stephen Singer.  As a Jew, do you have any tattoos?  No, no.  Rich does.  He's not a real Jew.  He's like a Jew who wants to be a Dago.  It's a tattoo of a Star of David, which is like completely against.  Gary's a message.  Exactly.  All I can tell you is, I'm in this industry group.  It's a real high-line industry group.  There's like 850 members, not just in the United States, but all different countries, Scotland, England.  And I got a text.  They were listening.  I said, listen, I'm one of these guys.  They're great.  They used to be in Philly.  I said, we just signed a real long-term deal. 
[00:52:30]  We just started going back with them, and I'm really excited about it.  And so he's listening this morning.  He's on the Internet.  He's listening.  He goes, Ethan, and they're talking to you guys.  They're talking about cleaning your ass out.  Whatever.  He goes, you must be so proud.  You know what I mean?  I love your affiliation.  I said, yeah, that's great.  That's exactly what my parents say.  I'm trying to ‚Äì I'm saying, oh, no, you don't understand.  They're really great.  You're going to get into it.  They've got this funny comedian.  It's a really good show.  It's this and that.  It throws on you like mold.  It's kind of a mistake we do.  Every once in a while, and there's a feedback.  Somebody will write, we didn't stop talking about washing out your underwear. 
[00:53:00]  I'm trying to turn people on to your show today from work.  Well, the good thing is that my headphones keep going on and off.  It's just like regular terrestrial radio.  Nothing works, and it's good.  You know that group you belong to?  Yes.  Anthony belongs to a group that wants to put an end to your group.  I am not a Nazi.  I am fascinated with the whole World War II era.  I have certain collectibles from all of the Axis and Allied powers.  We're just going to test your loyalty big time, Stephen Singer.  You have no idea.  He's got the Hitler mustache. 
[00:53:30]  Why not?  He has a camera.  You have no idea.  We're going to test your loyalty.  I hate old Jews.  I'm a self-hating Jew.  He likes the Germans and the nosy Americans.  Those pesky allies.  Those put-in-skied allies.  Absolutely.  Are you kidding me?  I love Obama.  He's a big fan of Israel.  He's terrific.  Yeah, I like the fact that he's over there at the climate summit thing that's going on.  What a joke that is. 
[00:54:00]  I'm sorry.  I think Obama is a blithering idiot.  Really?  Well, he's presented as being very intelligent.  But to entertain this climate summit, which amounts to nothing more than pretty much China  and India can keep pumping out whatever the hell they want, and then all the other industrialized  countries, including the United States, which of course will be at the forefront, have to  pay money for damages we've done to the environment while China and India pump out coal and produce 
[00:54:30]  more crap that we're buying than any other country.  It's unfair.  It takes away American jobs, and it puts financial burden on us again and leaves no burden on China  or India.  They could pump out whatever the hell they want.  We have to clean up.  He shouldn't have even gone to this thing.  Hillary is another idiot that shouldn't have entertained this thing.  Like England said, it has turned into a farce, a farce, this summit thing.  By the way, coldest time that they've had, where the hell are they? 
[00:55:00]  Not in Denmark.  I keep thinking Denmark, but it's not.  I don't know.  I was watching this.  Somebody will get me.  The summit on TV.  It's in Copenhagen.  Copenhagen.  I'm watching the summit on TV, and this couple from Virginia is walking through the summit,  and they weren't even invited there.  And they got right past security to get in.  Not a bad reference.  Shut up, dry hair.  Okay?  Dry.  You know how much glue I got on my hair to make it look like this?  Oh, my God. 
[00:55:30]  Your hair makes his hair look moist.  Yes.  You see something about Mary?  Shut up, cactus head.  Jesus.  He's our biggest sponsor, Rick.  I hate Rich Moss.  I don't want to make it out of it.  All right, listen.  Here's what you guys are forgetting.  Listen.  We have bums.  Hold on.  I want to hear what else.  I want to hear what else Rich has to say about our biggest sponsor.  Nothing.  There's nothing.  He thought I was here for the homeless contest.  He thought I was one of the homeless.  He had AIDS.  Shut up.  It doesn't even make sense.  No, it doesn't.  He looks like Lou Ferrigno. 
[00:56:00]  He was green with no hearing.  Good one, Rich.  What are you talking about?  I don't know, but he's laughing, so shut up.  That's all that matters.  You're like his assistant, right?  She's fucking hot.  Believe you me.  Are you married, girl?  You're dating?  I'm 22, right?  How old are you?  25.  How long have you been with the...  That shit's got to be as tender as veal.  Shut up.  You can cut that shit with a fork.  You know what I'm saying?  You don't even need a knife to cut that.  I don't know how long you've been with a boyfriend.  You can save some and have it the next morning in an omelet.  You know what I'm saying?  That's how tender that is.  What are these black preacher jokes?  You can chop her up with a biscuit. 
[00:56:30]  How long have you been with your boyfriend?  Less than a year.  Less than a year.  Are you two?  That's good.  I didn't know.  No two.  She's off the room.  She's one eighth.  Oh, she has an account somewhere?  And what do you actually do for Stephen Singer?  Yeah?  She's my media buyer.  Eye candy?  She's your media buyer?  Right.  Maybe she should start buying you some hair conditioner, too.  I'm an ugly Jew, so she gets me in the door because she's good looking.  Maybe when she's getting some media, can you throw in some VO5? 
[00:57:00]  I like VO5.  Cut down to VO4.  Mark down to VO3.  It's like a hair helmet.  He's our biggest sponsor.  No, he's your only.  Oh, my headphones just went back when I can hear him now.  That's good.  You carry around an Aryan girl with you.  Exactly.  It's wonderful.  All right.  Let's get the audience in here.  Yes.  Let's do that.  I want to thank Stephen Singer for stopping by.  Jimmy took the glass cookie.  I had two cookies.  I have to go with this.  You had three cookies. 
[00:57:30]  I had two chocolate chips.  I had two of these.  I had five cookies.  But there were four chocolate chips, and I had one.  I had two.  Rich just knocked the cookie out of my hand.  Anthony's cookie out of his hand.  You ass.  Thank God there's another.  Wow.  Away from you.  All right.  What are we doing?  We're bringing in the audience first?  One by one?  I'm like with these.  Here comes the audience that was hand-picked.  Could someone bring another cookie for Anthony?  No.  Chocolate chip?  It's okay.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Jesus.  Who's this?  Anton LaVey from the Church of Satan? 
[00:58:00]  We got a wallet.  Look at this.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Why don't we get a mic, and we force the listeners to introduce themselves before they  come in.  Can you get a mic right next to the door, please?  How about Sam?  Wow.  That's a good one.  Sam's good with the audience.  Sam.  Yeah.  I want you to work the audience as they come in.  Okay.  Make them say their name, where they're from, and what do they do?  And how old were they when they were touched?  And basically have them say how great we are.  By the way, White Trash Voss, as he made that remark, is putting a tin-foiled half 
[00:58:30]  a bagel into his fucking coat pocket.  It's not a half a bagel.  What is it?  Okay.  It's a fucking, it's a muffin, all right?  Oh, what a zilch.  Well, I'm not going to eat a muffin in a radiator at the same time, all right?  Keep it for later.  Yeah.  What should I do?  Throw it out?  It's a brand new muffin.  All right.  You're slowing down the show.  You're a shitty Porsche.  You fucking did.  You're slowing down the show now.  We're ready to introduce the audience.  Trading for papers to get out of the ghetto. 
[00:59:00]  That's what you got to do, is ask everybody in the audience, do you have your papers?  Are you papers?  You should use your headphones.  All right, Sam, you know what you're doing?  Yeah, should we start?  Yeah.  Yeah, so they have to introduce themselves.  You got a mic?  Wow.  Does this mic move?  Here comes the audience.  No, I'm getting an extension cable.  Why don't the mics move?  Don't they understand we're going to have to move?  Why don't you just take one out?  Can you take one out?  It's all right.  Yeah, they didn't plan.  I think it's short cable.  Give them all one of these as they come in.  Give them a, I hate Steven Singer, $100 bill.  They'll approach this mic until we get an extension.  All right, yeah, put the burden on them. 
[00:59:30]  But force them.  All right.  Force them to say something nice about us.  Here's a lady.  This is Heather Height.  I know, but I'm just saying it like an audience member.  Oh, for the audience, I'll say something nice about Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm Heather Height.  I work at a porn shop and do stand-up comedy.  Oh.  Oh.  And Opie and Anthony are my heroes.  How long have you been doing?  All right.  How long have you been doing comedy?  For three years.  Go get me a coffee. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, Rich.  She's actually, Heather's good, man.  I know I met her a couple times.  I like her tattoo.  I want to talk about the porn shop a little bit.  Let me see your tattoo.  Let me see your tattoo.  That's fucking nice, man.  She got a tat on her tit.  It's so great to have pale fucking...  Oh, wow.  You went all in.  Because of the comedy.  The comedy angle.  Oh, yes.  Microphone with...  Comedy and microphone and...  Comedy.  That's what you want to see when you're sucking nipples with fucking an open mic. 
[01:00:30]  Fucking one of the March brothers.  That's good.  All right, ladies and germs.  The porn shop is Expressions in Long Island.  I work at the one in Lindenhurst.  Expressions.  Make it sound all nice.  Yeah, what's the expression?  Ouch.  Coming out of a girl's ass.  Depends on what you're into.  Or yuck.  You should pull the beads out and there's liverwurst on them.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Heather Hyde, everyone.  We got to move on.  We got to meet everybody here.  We got an extension cable.  So where do they sit? 
[01:01:00]  Go all the way to the end there, Heather.  That would probably work.  Courtesy of Mars.  Mars Salino.  He's working like a maniac today.  All right.  Now, Sam, you can really work the crowd.  All right, great.  There you go.  It needs something to touch.  See, the magic is building.  Yes, slide down to the end.  Yeah.  Don't take a middle seat.  Sam, go ahead.  Okay, next.  Please state your name, what you do for a living, and what do you like about the Opie and  Anthony show?  Oh, I like that.  Well, my name is David.  I'm the owner of the Joker's Wild Comedy Club in Plainview. 
[01:01:30]  And what I like about the Opie and Anthony show is the hilarity and honesty and, of course,  Anthony's appreciation of national socialism.  Thank you, sir.  He also likes strap-ons, this guy.  Yes, he does.  Yes, I do.  Oh, damn it.  Heather Hyde.  You mean wearing them or getting fucking banged?  Heather Hyde.  Heather Hyde.  What am I, a faggot?  I let that redhead fuck me in the ass.  Heather Hyde.  What am I?  Well said, sir.  Heather Hyde bangs him with a strap-on.  Get out of here, will you?  Absolutely.  It's the best thing ever. 
[01:02:00]  She bangs you with a strap-on?  Absolutely.  Is that why your eyes are all popped out of your head right now?  They certainly are.  Fucking.  Get the fuck out of me.  Sir, what's your name?  Why?  Florentine just walked in.  Did you say something nice about the opium?  I pulled trains with them.  Jim Florentine has entered the fishbowl.  Jim, do you want to sit between me and Ed?  We always have got someone said, there's cookies for you.  Florentine.  There's cookies and cake.  We're having fun over here.  It's like a party.  Anything else with this guy that likes strap-ons? 
[01:02:30]  We're all good with him?  Yeah, very good.  Let's go.  Let's move on, sir.  Next, please state your name.  What you do for a living, and what do you like about the Opie and Anthony show?  My name is Janine.  I'm a makeup artist, and what I like about the show is the opportunity it gives us to  make some really nice friends and all the charitable work that they do.  That's fantastic.  You know what she doesn't like about the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, more about Anthony is my slippery floors when she's completely intoxicated. 
[01:03:00]  She fell down my stairs.  She fell down my stairs, and then I have, like, marble tile floor, and she slipped on  that and banged her head against one of my Roman columns.  What the hilarity that happens at my house.  That saved you time.  Did I just hit my head?  Is she fucking me?  No, believe me.  That hurts.  You fell right on it. 
[01:03:30]  And she likes making balloon animals.  Are you going to make any balloon animals for us today?  I am not.  Boom.  Oh, come on.  Boring.  Boom.  All right.  It's one of your talents.  Thank you, Janine.  All right.  Usher in by the butt-fucking Nazi over there.  I know.  Next, your name, what you do for a living, and what do you like about Opie and Anthony?  My name is Kim.  I'm an accountant, and I like the live events with the fans.  Ah, haven't had one in a while.  I know.  This is very nice that we're able to bring live people in here.  I'm very happy to be here.  You have nice bosoms.  Thank you. 
[01:04:00]  They're not, like, tits for her.  They look like just bosoms.  You know what I mean?  But no.  They're bosoms.  No one knows what you mean.  They're lovely.  They're lovely.  For a cookie, will you show us one?  No.  Oh.  Scram.  All right, Sam.  Move on.  All right.  Next, what's your name, where do you work, and what do you like about Opie and Anthony?  He cooks food.  Didn't you bring the food for the homeless people?  Yes, he did.  What?  We couldn't get enough people.  Here's the beauty of dumb voice.  For a cookie, her boyfriend brought the cookies. 
[01:04:30]  Would you have picked the worst person?  Could you thrash your tits for a cookie that he gave you?  How about a corn muffin?  It's the homeless bag.  It's courtesy of Artisan's Brew Pub and Grill.  It's formerly Basil Teas.  He brought food for the homeless people, and I shoved five of those bums cookies in my face.  They were delicious.  Wait, what happened to Basil Teas?  We changed the name.  Why?  Why?  Because we've been confused with the restaurant of the exact same name in Red Bank for many, many years now.  Yeah, but we pushed your Basil Teas.  Now we've got to start all over. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  He is also the official caterer of the compound.  Yes.  It's gold.  Have people been in touch with you about Christmas?  Yes.  I just spoke to Ange the other day.  You are wonderful.  See?  I heartily endorse, heartily endorse the food there.  It's amazing.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, fellas.  All right.  Moving on.  Hopefully, I'll get a discount.  I don't know.  Payola.  Thanks.  Here's a guy who used to show up to the 57th Street studio all the time.  Cool. 
[01:05:30]  Leonard Lawrence.  Thank you.  A UFC fighter.  What's your name, occupation, and your favorite thing about Opie and Anthony?  My name is Jason.  I'm unemployed.  For his hockey.  And I enjoy when Jim Norton plays the Borgata music box on Martin Luther King weekend.  Thank you.  I'm only doing two nights.  Wow.  I'd be lazy.  What's the call for tickets?  I don't know the number, actually.  I should know.  But thank you very much.  I'm going to that one.  Are you?  I have a dream of making some money. 
[01:06:00]  Gambling.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Thank you.  Occasionally, I like opening the bomb bait doors and letting a little weight off.  We didn't say hi to Jim Florentine yet.  Hey, Florentine.  Jim, any observations yet?  I'm here because I'm a big Rich Foss fan, and I like his corny lines like scram and bosoms.  You like that?  Yeah, I feel like I'm 1950s.  Like I'm watching Little Rascals.  When Foss was a teen, scram.  Scram.  He's on fire today.  He'll tell you.  I wish.  He'll tell you later. 
[01:06:30]  When he makes all his cell phone calls to all of us.  Who's next, Sam?  We've got another female next.  What's your name?  Oh, cool.  Hi, I'm Karen.  I work in logistics.  Logistics?  And I like GME because we went to the same high school.  Oh, what year did you graduate?  I'm not going to say.  Oh, lady never tells.  That's what happened.  Oh, good gravy.  So you went on to start a shortscarf.com.  Yes.  Obviously.  You're wearing a very short scarf.  Oh, my God.  I don't think you even have to be told, but that is a short little scarf.  I graduated.  I actually dropped out in 86. 
[01:07:00]  I was class of 86.  Same gym teacher.  Oh, Mr. Young?  Yes.  He died.  Yeah, I liked him.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  I don't know, but I hear there was powdered sugar in his mustache.  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  But he was a good guy.  Oh, that's good.  Logistics.  That's nice and vague.  What's next there?  Next is some guy with glasses.  What's your name?  Abby Hoffman.  Abby Hoffman.  Mike.  Cool.  It's Kirk Hammett, 1980s.  Yeah.  There's another one.  Mike, where are you from?  What's your occupation? 
[01:07:30]  And what do you like about the show?  What was the first one?  Where are you from?  All right.  This guy.  And I like Opie's boyish good looks.  Oh, all right.  Lucky you, Opie.  That's the one I wanted.  Well, welcome to the show, sir.  Yes.  Cool.  Take a seat.  Yes.  We'll be handing out brushes in a little while.  Chicago 7 right here.  All right.  Next, what's your name?  That's fine.  I know.  I'm not even working there.  Mike Spano.  And I was Muhammad Atta's roommate. 
[01:08:00]  Come on.  What do you do for a living?  I'm an estimator for a construction company, and I live on downtown 22nd.  Does your little brother know you're wearing his sweater?  Jesus Christ, you have a high-water sweater.  How does that possibly happen?  How hot is your dryer?  Your belly button must be cold.  I don't know why when Voss was bombing with the sweater jokes, I jumped in and tried to  help him out.  Yeah.  And what's your favorite part of the Opie and Anthony show?  I guess the convenience factor, because I drive out east every morning, 6 a.m., so 
[01:08:30]  it's...  Yeah, man.  It's very convenient.  I feel like I'm a miss issue.  Welcome to the show, sir.  Yeah.  We have to sit him in the...  Some people have to go sit in the back, too, because...  All right.  Who's this?  Oh, and look, everybody.  It's Bobo.  Oh.  Oh, hi, Bobo.  What's your name?  How's everything going?  Happy holidays, everybody.  How's everything going?  Yeah.  Bobo spent the week taking phone calls from Danny, letting Danny know that he would make  out with him. 
[01:09:00]  What?  He kept calling asking for it.  Sounds like what a rapist says, you know.  He's asking for it.  Believe me, the whole thing was giving me nightmares taking those calls.  Really?  But are you going to make out with him?  He said he'd do it for $50, and he'd also touch his dick for $50.  $50?  You do understand that's solicitation.  Prostitution?  He offered.  He said, I'll do it for $50.  Would you make out with a homeless guy for $100?  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  I like those DSLs on him.  I know.  It's juicy.  It's money.  Well, it certainly is, and it's kissing a homeless guy.  I know.  Should we ask him what's in the bag there?  What do you got there, Bobo?  That's just candy canes I was handing out to everyone.  They're the shittiest candy canes anybody's ever eaten.  The cheap, like, every candy cane is the same.  Candy canes suck.  Yeah, they're the worst.  Every candy cane pretty much tastes the same.  That is true.  Yeah.  They look the same, too.  Yes, they do look the same.  They all look the same, and they're shiftless. 
[01:10:00]  Voss actually just threw his shoulder out, breaking a candy cane.  But he's a tough guy.  Let's not forget.  It's like Voss's hips.  All right.  Who's next there?  Thank you, Al.  Real quick.  I have just a quick issue with Bobo.  Bobo, do me a favor.  Lose my fucking phone number, too.  Oh!  What happened?  Oh, Keith!  Halloween.  This fucking moron called me.  Had to have been which...  I don't know which asshole on the staff put him up to it. 
[01:10:30]  One of you guys.  At least a dozen times to get picked up from the train station to come to the compound  for the Halloween party.  Like he was invited.  Like he was invited.  He called me.  I'm at the train station.  Pick me up.  And I keep fucking ignoring him.  I'm at work.  I'm trying to work.  And this guy non-fucking...  Did you guys make him take the train all the way out to Long Island?  Travis did.  Travis did.  So you went all the way out to Long Island from Jersey.  Get on mic, Bobo.  And you never were invited to the party. 
[01:11:00]  I live in Queens.  Oh, Queens.  Okay.  What happened?  By the way, Keith, that phone number has been deleted from my phone.  Ooh.  Oh!  Oh!  He doesn't want any part of you, Keith.  Oh, Jesus.  Why?  Was it long distance?  Your mom told you to take it out?  He just talks over everybody.  Yeah, yeah.  He plows right through.  It was deleted.  It's what?  It was requested, so I deleted it.  What's the fugitive voice?  No one believes it was you.  It sounded so different.  I think I did it underneath a tissue. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't that head look perfect in a scope?  Yeah.  Just like with the crosshairs, right?  I could just see a paint mist flying out of it.  Where's fucking Lee Malvo when you need him?  Bobo, what are you doing for the show today?  I'm going to be playing the kazoo along with when the homeless are singing.  Yeah?  How are you going to be doing that if you're going to be kissing them?  Yeah.  Well, I'll do that after.  We secretly painted a homeless guy's cock to look like a kazoo. 
[01:12:00]  No, I actually brought a kazoo.  Oh, I'll rhyme like he's explained.  No, no.  I won't be having the filleting a hopeless man.  You understand.  You brought a kazoo.  Great.  The next lucky audience member, what's your name, what's your occupation, and what do you  like about O&A?  Dave from Hoboken, and I just came to see the talent we have on the streets with the  homeless.  Not O&A.  And O&A.  O&A Party Rock, of course.  O&A Party Rock.  Ouss. 
[01:12:30]  Rape.  There we go.  Oh, look at this.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't call.  You can't call?  Hold on.  Bobo just answered his phone with, I can't call right now.  Bobo answered the phone, yeah, and just said, I can't call right now.  Who was that, Bobo?  I don't know.  Some wrong number.  Can I see your phone for a second?  No, it's a wrong number.  I bet it was a wrong number.  Bobo's phone number was...  What is that, a razor?  Can I...  Can I...  There you go. 
[01:13:00]  No, don't do it.  Why would you do that?  Oh, my God.  Sam, you can't let you do that.  Oh, my God.  No, keep it away from him.  Keep it away from him.  Keep it away.  Bobo, do you want a cookie?  You want a cookie, Bobo?  What?  His phone number was leaked on Twitter.  Your phone number couldn't drip out.  His new phone number?  Hold on to...  Take the brown one.  Take the good one.  The brawny guy's coming in now.  Right.  Another reference from the 70s.  Exactly.  It's funny.  Hey, look, it's Madge's hands. 
[01:13:30]  Fucking oldie.  That one worked well.  That one worked well.  That looks like the bad guy in episode 27 of Macmillan and Wife.  Rockford Files.  Who was the bad guy?  The broken condom?  Did you call it Robert Files?  No, Rockford.  All right.  I just want to make sure.  Macmillan and Beard.  Sir.  What's your name, occupation, and favorite thing about Opie and Anthony?  Justin, I'm a truck driver and entertainment in endless hours behind a fucking wheel. 
[01:14:00]  Welcome to the titty twister.  The truck driver.  That's it?  Watch the movie, Bob.  Don't give me that look.  All right.  Let's move on.  All right, Cole.  He's a bore.  Let's feel that.  Oh, Jesus.  Leave a prison guard haircut alone.  All right, cool.  Chris Angel.  What's your name, occupation, and favorite thing about the show?  My name is Chris.  I'm an illustrator, and I've actually never heard the Opie and Anthony show before.  Wow. 
[01:14:30]  You and most of the country.  That was very hurtful.  Oh, shut up.  We've got our biggest sponsor here.  He doesn't want to hear that shit.  This man has a tattoo under his hair.  Does he?  Yeah.  What's the tattoo?  From the looks, it's very soon to be very visible.  Yes.  What is it?  A chemo?  Wait, let's see it.  What is it?  A chemo.  Small dragons on both sides.  Small dragons on both sides?  It's a sign of how bright I was when I was younger. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, you did it?  You shaved your head, and then it grew back in?  And it's above his neck.  Fortunately.  When you get a tattoo above your neck and your head, you're just saying, I never want a real  job in my life.  Star David tattoo on your arm.  Exactly.  You have a tattoo of Jesus with boo written next to it.  You can't cover it from your Lord.  I can't cover it from what?  From your Lord.  He hasn't shown up.  We're waiting for him there.  That's it, because once you die, you can't go to wherever Jews go with a tattoo on.  Oh, I really?  When I'm dead, that's not my fucking problem.  No faith?  No faith in your Jewish religion?  I have a lot of faith.  No, you don't. 
[01:15:30]  Apparently not.  You tattooed yourself.  You don't care what happened to me yesterday.  I could have a Jewish star, at least, didn't I?  They're not going to like that.  They don't like it.  Or a Catholic cemetery.  You're going to.  Here's the next guy.  All right.  Hi, sir.  What's your name, occupation, and what do you like about the show?  Matt, I am a valet.  A valet?  Yeah.  Wrestling.  Please.  It's a wrestling thing, right?  What?  No, like valet cars.  Oh.  Oh.  You're a valet parking guy.  I thought he was between two mountains.  Hold it.  He's wearing a.  That is a wrestling sweatshirt, right? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And he did say valet, so I just want to back up.  I didn't know.  My fact.  A valet could be a few things.  Right.  You could be a personal valet to somebody, and that's a pretty good job, or your job.  Or somebody could put.  Right.  Or somebody going to bed at night could put wallets on you.  Can you go home?  Holy shit.  We have a room full of people that had no clue what you meant.  You have no.  That got no laughs.  But it was clever.  It wasn't clever.  It was fucking clever.  Okay, so one does work out follow with something better.  All right.  A valet. 
[01:16:30]  You put your fucking stuff on it, on your dresser.  No one knows that, old lady.  I know.  I do not.  No one knows.  Hold on.  Let me go to the try.  Did you know what a valet was?  I put it on my chest of drawers.  Exactly.  What are you talking about?  We're standing in the parlor.  Rich, you've got to pace yourself.  Pace yourself.  You don't know what a valet is.  No one does.  Not in that context.  You're fucking dumb.  Steven Singer, you don't know what that is.  No, I put it on my night table.  And if Steven Singer doesn't know.  I put my wallet on my night table. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  A little fucking valet.  No one knows what that is.  Club Zodacani, do you know what a valet is?  Yeah, it's me.  See, he's got to laugh.  That's stupid.  All right, valet.  Valet.  Pilfering people's fucking glove boxes.  Cool.  This gentleman.  I'm so special on you.  What's your name, occupation, and your favorite thing about the show?  I'm Ralph.  I'm also a valet.  And I don't know.  It's just a funny show. 
[01:17:30]  How do you guys treat the cars?  Do you fuck with the cars or not?  You steal our quarters, don't you?  Me personally, no.  But people I work with, yes.  They steal?  Who's the guy behind Patty?  What's up?  Oh, God.  Black guy.  That's a blank joke.  So.  Jesus.  All right, so.  What an asshole.  There are people that steal out of the cars?  Yeah, other companies do.  The other company I work for, most of them don't.  You ever.  Most of them.  I mean, some do.  I mean, I'm not going to lie.  Do you ever jump in a car and there's a gasser in there? 
[01:18:00]  Because I leave them for the valets all the time.  I've actually gotten in a car and there's somebody passed out in the bed of a  pickup truck with their face kind of snatched together.  They didn't play for the bagels, but that scared the hell out of me.  Wow.  Very good, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Ouch.  Very good.  Too soon?  Let's get the audience in before 10 o'clock, okay?  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Name occupation and favorite thing about the show.  Matt, I'm an investigator.  Look everything except your half-assed talent.  That's it.  Oh.  You pointed to boss.  Fucking gargoyle ears. 
[01:18:30]  You should be hanging on a fucking library.  Hanging or sitting over the doorway of one?  Either one.  You should be sitting on a valet.  You should be wearing a doily.  Gargoyles don't have it.  Just tell Miss Graham.  What do you investigate?  Money laundering and terrorist financing.  Really?  Oh, really?  You want to look at this?  The Stephen Singer dollar?  Stephen Singer's got some money laundering.  You might want to talk to that man.  Do you utilize the Patriot Act at all?  All the time.  Okay.  Now, is it overblown that people are paranoid that regular citizens are going to be hassled with this? 
[01:19:00]  It's like people are going after the strip club owners.  It's just a paranoia around the Patriot Act.  I believe it is a paranoia more than anything.  It's not being used to target regular citizens who just have honest lives.  Absolutely not.  No.  My friends go to Atlantic City every weekend, get an eight ball of Coke, and talk about it over the phone.  They're not getting busted.  They're not.  I like how you said you're friends.  Yeah, exactly.  Good one.  He's an investigator.  He's not stupid.  All right, cool.  Oh, the guy that lost the way from Subway.  I know. 
[01:19:30]  What's your name, Occupation?  This is our Make-A-Wish kid.  I know.  Oh, gee, I just want to laugh one more time.  Yes, I just want Prince Harry's cheeks.  Welcome, sir.  What's your name?  No, what's your name?  No, you don't get...  Martin.  Hi, Martin.  What do you do?  He looks like Tommy John.  Go back fucking how many years.  You're not joking, all things flying at the same time.  What do you do?  Just rich headphones. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's smart.  Yeah.  What do you do?  I'm an accountant.  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah, exactly.  The most thrilling job of the room.  Sit next to the singer of the room.  That's why I listen to the show.  I have to have some thrill in my life.  I hear you.  All right.  It's not your busy season, is it?  April's coming up the wow.  Oh, boy.  There is a high instance of alcoholism in accounting, though, so that's why I thought it was good  for me.  How did I miss that?  I know.  We should have been an accountant.  Exactly. 
[01:20:30]  Thank you, sir.  Wow.  Oh, and look at this foxy mama coming in.  Oh, here she is.  It's Stalker Patty.  Everything.  How did you know?  She hasn't said her name yet.  Hi, I'm Stalker Patty.  Oh, Jesus.  Hello.  Well, we all know who I am.  Your sweater matches your teeth today.  Oh, my God.  I'm just wearing it.  Very funny, too.  The amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat she's got on.  Oh, that's great.  It looks like the age quilt.  Well, I am age. 
[01:21:00]  No.  He said age.  Actually, I'm not old.  I'm ripe.  He said age, you dummy.  The age quilt.  Not age quilt.  Age.  That's what I said.  No, Patty, you're right.  You're right.  You're not old.  You're ripe.  That's funny.  It was still better than Boss's Valet Joe.  Yeah, but I'm not aged.  I'm ripe.  What do you mean by that?  Yeah, what do you mean?  Yeah.  We all need to know.  What, you're on your third day?  I don't wipe after a jump.  I'm ripe.  What do you mean, ripe?  Well, like I said, I'm not old. 
[01:21:30]  I'm ripe.  No, what does that mean?  No, she means she should be riped.  We could do that for you.  It means I'm still full of life no matter how old I am.  It means you're fucking bruised soft and ready to be thrown out.  Stop it.  Actually, that's when fruit is at its sweetest.  Oh, yuck.  The older the chicken, the better the soup.  Shut it.  Stop it.  I'll take a little one that goes peep, peep any day. 
[01:22:00]  Exactly.  Oh, really?  I'd rather fucking eat a chicken and have bad soup.  Patty, you bring gifts or anything today?  Yeah, you always bring Christmas gifts.  What are you doing for our big show today?  What?  What are you doing for the show today?  I just came.  Did you?  Wow.  Boy, isolate that, by the way.  We need that clip isolated for every instance ever.  I just came.  I just came. 
[01:22:30]  Little Drew Boogie gets a hold of that.  My dick just went in.  All right, Patty.  Go sit next to the garbage.  Your teeth look exceptionally gummy today, if I could say that.  They really do.  Are you grinding your teeth at night?  You know what?  Just sit there.  Yeah, with a Black & Decker grinder.  Those little chicklets.  They look like the ones that attacked Sigourney and Weaver at the end of Aliens.  The ones that came out of them.  We got it, Jim.  All right.  Good God.  Your son.  All right.  Your son.  All right.  Perp number seven.  We all know who this is.  Hold on. 
[01:23:00]  Hold on, Rich.  Once again.  Let it be known.  No one laughed.  That's okay.  I've already got...  I'm fucking two for...  You don't think that guy can kick your fucking ass?  I know he can.  Yeah.  You don't know who this guy is?  I know he can.  Look at him.  You know what's he got to lose?  That's Chuck Milligan.  He fights in the UFC.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  Sam, I noticed all our chairs aren't going to be filled up.  For real?  Oh, they will be.  Because my mystery guest still hasn't come in.  Mystery guest.  You've got a mystery guest.  Fantastic.  What's up, sir? 
[01:23:30]  Sir, how are you today?  What's your name?  My name is Carlton.  I'm a stagehand.  Mm-hmm.  And...  Why are you so serious?  I don't fight in the UFC.  I don't think so.  What do you like about Obi and Anthony?  Not much, right?  Just to see that droll face.  That droll look on your face.  Yeah, you.  Are you talking to me?  Yes, Rich.  He has a problem with you, Rich.  Why are you upset?  Relax.  I'm upset.  He has a problem with you.  You heard what Rich said.  He said.  He has a problem with me.  Show him your skills.  Get up, Rich, and show him your skills.  No, I don't have any skills.  Get a kick.  Show him your kick, at least.  That's fair.  Show him a kick.  Show him what he's going to be doing. 
[01:24:00]  I've got nothing.  You guys want to see Rich Foss right now.  They want to see him.  Take my boots off?  No.  Foss, show him your skills in front of the room, please.  A fight.  A fight.  Carlton and Rich.  What did he say?  Don't worry about it.  Show your karate kick.  Get up there and show a kick.  It's fucked up.  What do you mean your back is fucked up?  I threw out my back.  Wow.  Oh, I was hoping you said your act.  Just show him.  I thought he did.  This is a photo op, guys.  Rich Foss will show you his karate kick. 
[01:24:30]  Come on, Rich.  Come on, Rich.  Oh, come on, Rich.  Oh, Rich.  Come on, Rich.  Come on.  Get up there.  You actually can kick.  Yeah, it is pretty amazing, actually.  Put a few pounds on, but you can still kick.  Yeah, we all see it.  Oh, no.  We all see it.  It's a nice act body.  Abs of steel wool.  Will you show him the kick?  Oh, good.  You almost tripped.  That's right.  All right.  You kick Bobo in the head.  Go away, Bobo.  Oh, shit. 
[01:25:00]  You don't want him to fly off.  Oh, Christ.  Rich will be good in the middle of a fight if you take your boots off and get ready.  Yeah.  I like to see that and someone just step on his toes.  What do you have on the top of your socks?  It actually says feet.  It says left and right.  All right, here's Rich Foss.  Oh, damn.  Could you kick it?  That's pretty good.  That's not bad for a 58-year-old man.  It's not bad at all.  Mars, you want to show him how it's done?  Kenny, is that good?  Because Kenny takes karate.  Does he have any form?  No, it's good.  No power.  All form.  No power, though. 
[01:25:30]  Mars does, too.  Hey, you guys want Mars on the radio?  He does a great job on the radio.  Yeah, Mars is always radio gone.  Mars, what do you think?  Mars, your observations so far?  The big show before the holiday?  Oh, it's happening.  It's banging, man.  Everything worked out today.  Technically, everything was good to go.  Thank you, Mars.  That was an excellent addition.  Good to go.  So what do you got today?  Well, the plugs are all working.  Boo.  All right.  Carlton, you want to sit down?  Sure.  Just follow the yellow brick road.  Put it in the back of the room.  Put it in the back of the room, please.  Holy shit. 
[01:26:00]  He is short.  He's stocky is what it is.  Leave Carlton alone.  He's got a riddle for you.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, you're far away.  Thank you, Carlton, everyone.  All right.  Yeah, take it.  And now...  Oh, come on.  Let him sit up front, for fuck's sake.  It's not a buzz.  Why is he sitting next to the beautiful girl?  Oh, yeah.  That is disturbing for me to watch.  Yes.  Don't worry.  We won't tell your father.  Yes.  That's what the Civil War was about.  All right.  So... 
[01:26:30]  Seating.  And now the mystery guest.  Mystery guest.  I'm very excited.  We got some empty seats in the back, though, Sam.  Yeah, why don't people slide the fuck down?  Slide down, people.  Oh, please.  Yeah.  Carlton, you two.  Why couldn't we have just made this open call to let people come?  Well, now we don't have...  Since we can fucking lie.  I think there's a few standbys, right?  Yeah, there's some standbys.  All right, go ahead.  Every seat will be filled.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  And one seat will be filled by our special guest.  Please welcome Intern David, everybody.  Oh, my God.  It's Intern David. 
[01:27:00]  Wow.  Oh, he's getting booze and a lackluster...  You're not going booze, you're going Jew.  Jew, Jew.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  It's like Jew Piniella in the 70s for the Yankees.  Now, David, wow, this is amazing.  How long has it been?  It's been like three months.  And now, what have you been doing with yourself?  You used to be an intern for the show, for those of you new to the show.  He is the most Jewish guy you'll ever, ever, ever see.  Steven Singer, is he the Jewish guy you've ever met?  The Jew... 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a real Jew right there, not Rich Voss.  He's every poster from 1938.  He looks like Dan Natterman's brother, right?  Yes.  Now, what have you been doing?  You left the Opie and Anthony show to pursue bigger and better things.  What are you doing, David?  I'm still trying to pursue bigger and better things.  But what are you doing yourself?  It's been three months.  How do you spend your days?  What do you do?  Pretty much just hanging out, working part-time, looking for a better work. 
[01:28:00]  What have you been doing for work?  Give us a couple of examples.  I'm still working at the same job that I had part-time when I was interning here.  What was that?  The movie theater.  Yeah, movie theater, yeah.  Your assistant to the assistant manager.  Yeah, assistant to the assistant to the assistant.  Yeah, like...  Oh, the movie theater?  No, it's not the way it goes.  Yeah, pretty much.  Hey, he does good interviews.  Bobo, can you put your thing on there?  You want him to interview Steve Singer?  Oh, yeah.  Interview Steve Singer.  Steve Singer.  Our biggest sponsor right there.  Biggest sponsor, Steven Singer Jewelers.  It's IHateStevenSinger.com.  Show everybody your interview skills. 
[01:28:30]  There it is.  Maybe a radio love.  Maybe a radio broadcaster's listening right now.  Feel the love.  We'll give you a job for doing this.  Show your interview chops.  Go ahead.  I'm former intern David, and I'm here with...  Steven Singer?  All right.  Hello, Mr. Singer.  What do you do for a living?  Thanks for listening to this show, you dummy.  I'm a jeweler.  Okay, and you're sponsoring the Opie and Anthony show today?  You have a tremendous grasp of the obvious.  Yes.  Ooh.  What kind of jewelry do you sell? 
[01:29:00]  Like watches or necklaces or anything particular?  Diamonds.  Oh, diamonds.  Okay.  See how they connected?  I see.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, diamonds.  Sounds like an angel.  I know.  You remember the same club.  This is great.  Diamonds.  Yes.  Keep going, David.  If I may ask, what's your most expensive piece of jewelry that you sell in your shop?  That's a good question.  About $55,000.  $55,000.  Wow.  How much is that expensive? 
[01:29:30]  I don't know.  You tell me.  Oh.  $59.  Wow.  Oh, a diamond for $59.  I think I could afford that.  Now, that's good if you want to give your girl a diamond on a budget here this Christmas.  What kind of a diamond is the $59 one?  To be surprised.  The diamond that's $59 is perfect.  That's for a girl you take out, you make it look like you like her, you just get a finger  of her once and throw her out of the car.  That's good.  David?  Yes.  Continue.  And the most expensive piece of jewelry, what kind of a diamond is that one? 
[01:30:00]  Big and nice.  Yes.  Does it have a name?  Yeah, the Tiger Woods special.  Well, why don't you ask for a job?  You're a Jew.  Oh, Jesus.  Well said, O.  Wow.  All right.  Heinrich Handler.  Have you ever sold, like, your most expensive piece of jewelry to a customer?  No, because...  You wouldn't still have it.  Yeah, you wouldn't still have it.  Yes, he just resells it.  What's the most expensive you've ever sold? 
[01:30:30]  A couple hundred thousand dollars.  Really?  Could you get the domain name, I feel sorry for Steven Singer?  Because I hate David.  Yeah.  You're awful.  You're not going to ask for a job?  You need work.  Think a little history.  How'd you get started?  Think just something interesting out of you.  Store hours, you know?  Ask him if he gets laid, man.  Yeah, things like that.  What made you decide to become a jewelry store owner? 
[01:31:00]  Well...  Besides already having the first...  Radio, circus clowns were filled up, so I became a jeweler.  Was there any history in the family?  It's like fucking jewelry.  There's history in the family, but nobody was in a jewelry store.  Oh, I gotcha.  This is really fucking horrific.  It really is.  Can I get a copy of this interview?  Oh, please, yeah.  I think it's being burnt as it's...  Write that one down.  I mean, literally burnt.  All right, let's...  Thank you, Steven Singer.  All right.  David, anything else?  I should be literally burnt.  Hey, Sam, what is intern David doing for the show today?  Intern David... 
[01:31:30]  Since this is such a Christmas-themed show, intern David will be singing some traditional  Jewish songs for us.  You guys want a traditional Jewish song before we go to break?  Get him in the front of the room.  All right, David.  To the front of the room.  I got to take a breather.  Maybe I should think before I talk.  I'm bombing.  I can't wait to hear it.  I'll be listening to the replay today. 
[01:32:00]  All right, guys, we got intern David.  He's going to do a traditional Jewish song.  Is Hanukkah over?  Over?  No, there's two more days.  Why would the mic work?  That would be stupid.  Try again.  No, there's two more days left of Hanukkah.  All right, so you're going to sing us a traditional Jewish song?  Sure.  I certainly will.  All right, what song is it?  I'll sing the Dreidel song.  That's the only one that comes to mind at the moment.  No, we all know the Dreidel song.  Yeah, we know that one.  Sing us something with some good... 
[01:32:30]  Sing us a good old Hebrew work song.  You got it, David.  I don't know any other songs.  Sing Hitler wasn't a bad guy if you knew him.  Oh, right.  Come on.  Boss.  No.  All right, just do the Dreidel song.  Oh, Christ.  Just do the Dreidel song?  Yeah.  All right.  Ready?  No.  Oh, Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel, I made you out of clay.  And when it's dry and ready, oh, Dreidel, I shall play. 
[01:33:00]  Hey.  There's more to it than that, right?  That's all I know of it.  God, if this doesn't feed into anti-Semitism, nothing else could make people hate Jews worse.  Are you mad that Bobo's the big star from the David and Bobo team?  Yeah.  You're like the other guy from Wham!  Hey, I heard all about him.  You heard all about him, huh?  I heard all about him.  I heard all about him.  He's getting a lot of air time.  It bothers you, doesn't it?  He's like thousands of followers.  What?  Bobo?  Thousands of followers.  What? 
[01:33:30]  He said he has thousands of followers.  Yeah.  You're like Garfunkel.  Are you lying?  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  Look at my stats.  Oh, his catchphrase.  Look at my stats.  I'm not lying.  You got it.  Just stats.  I think it's time for a break.  Yeah, we should do that.  We're going to meet the homeless guy.  Oh, wait.  Sandy Cain's here.  You want her now?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you got to bring her in.  It's like a lineup from Special Victims Unit.  I wish it was.  Sandy Cain.  God, am I fucking fat? 
[01:34:00]  This way.  No, no, no.  You know what?  We'll do it after the break.  Fuck it.  She ran away.  Yeah, she's lost.  Do we need to say anything?  No.  We're going to meet the homeless guys next.  We've got Jim Florentine here, Rich Voss, our listeners, homeless people next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Spring.  Hey, Opie and Anthony's Homeless Talent Show is presented by PennyStockChaser.com and  sponsored in part by IHateStevenSinger.com.  We are live from the fishbowl with Jim Florentine.  And Rich Voss is still in the stall.  He has a really hard one that he's trying to get out. 
[01:34:30]  What?  He was telling Jimmy and I, he goes, you ever have a hard shit where it makes you cum?  Oh, he's in that shit cum?  No.  I tried to shit.  No, I haven't.  And then there was a homeless guy in there that was, maybe he got to Rich, maybe that's  the deal.  Homeless guy just wandered into the bathroom while Rich was in there.  Where's Rich, though?  I'm going to give a, oh, but a Voss, if you want to see Voss New Year's Eve, Treehouse  Comedy in Harborside, Stanford, Connecticut.  And for Florentine, Saturday, January 30th, he'll be where I'm going to be tonight. 
[01:35:00]  The Bolton Center in Bayshore, Long Island.  The same gig I'm doing tonight.  You can see Jim, Saturday, January 30th.  And then December 18th, 19th, Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant.  Um, I'm getting urgent communiques that the homeless are getting very, very antsy, very  nervous.  Okay.  We could even lose a few, is what I heard, if we don't, uh...  You think they'd be happy that they're warm?  I know.  They're going to make money.  What the fuck?  It's freezing outside.  They're going to make money in here.  Where are they antsy to go?  What do they got to do? 
[01:35:30]  I just want to share what I've been doing to Rich the whole time, writing some notes while  we're broadcasting.  I want to punch you in the face.  I hate you.  Wonderful.  Those are lovely.  Those are things his fucking subconscious says to me.  All right.  What do you want to do?  Bring in the homeless.  All right.  Sam, you got the mic.  Where are we going to go?  Yeah.  Get stupid Sandy Kane.  Well, we got Big A out there, too.  He's a big star.  He should be.  Bring A in here, then.  All right.  Big A, come on in here real fast.  Give him three chairs.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Big A.  Big A.  Hi, Big A. 
[01:36:00]  Big A.  There he is.  There's Big A.  Let's spin this.  And we also have Rich from the bathroom.  You guys want Rich real fast?  Hold on.  Why not?  As we get the homeless, guys.  Rich, is that you?  Yes.  When are you coming back in here?  I can't stop.  What do you mean you can't stop?  I'm fucking pinching a loaf.  And I'm telling you, I'm so...  I can't tell you.  I must have lost three pounds.  I can't stop.  How many came out?  It's unbelievable.  It's just one big pile.  It looks like a big fucking shit tumor in the toilet. 
[01:36:30]  This is more good stuff you could be proud of.  Is it sticking out of the water?  It's out of the water.  It's sticking out of the toilet.  It's retouching me.  It's fucking unbelievable.  I want to take a picture of it.  It's a masterpiece.  We'll do that so we can all...  Does it have a little twirl at the top like an ice cream?  It looks like Steven Singer's hair.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, boy.  We got some scary...  All right.  We got some...  Get in here.  Rich.  Yeah, get in here.  All right, guys. 
[01:37:00]  Thank you, Rich.  Rich is still taking a shit.  All right.  Yes, Sam?  Now with Big A?  Yes.  Yeah, I guess.  Big A, we'll get back to him in a little bit.  You want me to grab Sandy before you bring in the homeless?  Yeah, just have her walk in.  We don't need to say hello.  We know her.  Well, I wanted her to work the crowd, though.  Oh, you wanted her?  Yeah, she's great at working the crowd.  Sam, tell her to work the crowd.  Take the mic in.  Sandy, come on in.  Sandy, this is what we want you to do.  I can tell her.  Sandy King, come here.  Take this microphone.  Go into the front of the audience.  Holy fuck.  And work the crowd a little bit for us, okay? 
[01:37:30]  Work the crowd.  Yeah.  Work the crowd.  You know, comment about what you see and all that.  She's got abs like Voss.  And she's younger.  Even a dollar would be good, folks.  All right.  All right.  All right.  And we'll see what happens.  Yeah, work the crowd a little bit.  Work that crowd.  Well, I knew that's all I would get.  Sandy, be the eyes of the listener and work the crowd a little bit.  I know that's all.  As I say, Candy Cane.  I'm Sandy Cane.  Oh, there you go.  Hello.  So how's everyone today?  I'm so excited to be here.  Christmas ain't Christmas without O and A. 
[01:38:00]  That's all I've got to say.  Oy vey.  And I'm so excited to be here.  I was supposed to, you know, I was supposed to...  Die?  Hey, Twano's in the house.  So what happened?  You stood up in the corner, freaked out?  What do you mean?  So anyway, Twano, hello.  Okay.  Yeah, we got it.  Well, Twano has a lot of fans, you know.  And work the crowd.  How's everyone today?  Any dicks in the room? 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  Will the dicks rise?  All right.  Let me...  Okay.  It was a bad idea.  All right.  All right, cool.  Sandy, sit down and enjoy the show.  Let's start bringing the homeless.  Take a seat next to David.  Yeah.  Here, Sandy.  Atta girl.  Would you sit the fuck down?  No one wants a lap dance.  There you go, Sandy.  No one wants a lap dance.  All right, cool.  Lap dance.  All right.  You don't want to pop you a colostomy bag if you give me a lap dance.  Oh, look at that. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Sam, time for the homeless.  All right.  Thank you.  You look better in person.  That's okay.  The moment you've all been waiting for.  And here we go.  We need the names.  We brought your own stool.  It's Pops.  There's a guy from The Shining.  What was his name?  Catman Brothers.  Catman Brothers.  Your son.  All right, Sam, why don't you talk to him?  What's his name?  Pops.  Pops is here.  Hi, Pops.  Oh, Pops got a candy canes.  Candy, no.  I got no teeth.  We got candy canes. 
[01:39:30]  Ham.  You missed the line, though.  Oh, I know.  He got no teeth.  He got no teeth, Pops.  At the bottom.  Bottom?  Excuse me.  Yeah.  Is it on?  It's on.  It's on.  You're broadcasting to the world right now.  Excuse me.  My name is Pops.  Hey, Pops.  Hey, Pops.  I'm homeless person for 35 years.  35 years?  That's a long time.  He's working the crowd better than Sandy.  Yeah, I know.  And Rich.  Is Rich back yet?  Oh, really?  How are you doing, Miss Lady?  Move your head down a little, Sam.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:40:00]  That's right.  How are you?  He's been homeless for 35 years.  Yeah.  How are you?  Can I come in your tent with you?  No.  Someone mic her.  How about we work out?  Why not?  Because you've got to be a young lady for me.  Oh, I'm too old for you?  That's horrible to say that to a woman.  Yeah, we kind of need two mics.  You never say that to a woman.  Whoever's producing the show today.  You know, and that's...  Oh.  I ain't old as you.  Oh, my God.  See, we're missing all the great lines because we don't have Pops.  Come on, baby.  You look kind of over the hill.  No, I'm... 
[01:40:30]  You look over the hill, honey.  No, ma'am.  Yes, baby.  No, Miss Lady.  So you're...  What?  I'm only 25 years old.  Uh-huh.  That's all.  25 years old.  This is the deleted scene from The Shining where Superman Brothers talks to the lady in the tub.  He's only 25 years old.  Who is this guy, y'all?  Yeah, motherfucker.  I'm Anthony.  He's the star of the fucking show.  I'm Anthony.  That's Opie.  What's up, Pops?  I knew him.  Jim Norton.  We met in the bathroom.  Hello.  He tried to touch my penis. 
[01:41:00]  I said no.  I'm Sandy Kane, the naked fucking cowgirl.  How about you...  Move the mic away a little bit.  I definitely don't want to know you.  Oh, what?  Come on.  Oh, no.  Pops doesn't want to know you.  You know, you remind me of my ex-husband.  You don't have to get so close to the mic, Sandy.  It's not a cock.  Pops, have you ever...  She's remembering her old days of working, girl.  Pops, have you ever had a white girl before?  Pops, you ever have sex?  Tiger Woods.  You ever have sex with a white girl before?  Tiger Woods in a house.  Yeah.  Pops, what do you think of...  You're looking like this, though.  No.  Hey, fuck you, ass. 
[01:41:30]  I look what you look like.  Ooh.  At least I got a home.  Ooh.  I'm not homeless, baby.  Ooh.  Shit.  All right, baby.  Look at him.  Oh, damn, yo.  Hey, would you kick her out of your box?  Look at him.  You would kick her out of your box, wouldn't you?  Pops, you're not going to take that shit, are you?  You're not going to take that shit.  No.  No.  You know what?  Go ahead, Pops.  You're right, dear, Miss Lady.  Oh, Miss Lady.  Oh, that's right.  Say it again.  God, I've never been more insulted. 
[01:42:00]  At least you have self-esteem, I'll tell you.  Yeah, well, I was born like that.  Oh, right.  Well, it's cool.  Where do you live?  Where don't you live?  Oh, good.  That was a good one.  Bite him with your bottom teeth.  Where don't you live was a good one, man.  Here's my book.  Oh.  He's got a stool, and then he lays down on the leg of the stool.  That's where...  That's good.  Jesus.  What do you, at work?  My pillow?  Yeah.  Now, Pop.  So the stool is your pillow.  As long as you're not there.  So where do you go to the... 
[01:42:30]  As long as you're not there.  She'd give you nightmares.  Okay, all right.  She won't give me nightmares, but I'm not fucking right there.  So, Pop, Pop, you'd rather lay on the street in the cold weather than lay in bed with  her?  Yes.  Yeah, we're talking to that Mike thing.  Yeah, Pop, please.  I think we'd probably get hard.  Probably get...  We wouldn't get hard.  Can it still get hard at your age?  Oh, yeah.  Trust me.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Just look at the rape records in Manhattan.  Oh, boy.  You want to see...  Come on.  Let me go in the bathroom. 
[01:43:00]  I'll show it to you.  Oh, damn.  Okay.  Yeah, come on.  Come on.  Oh, Jesus.  This is your first time for both of them.  This will work out well.  We got the men's room or the ladies' room.  Don't make a difference.  I'm kidding.  Okay.  Just go in the corner right there.  Go in the corner.  No, you can't go in the bathroom.  Go in the corner, turn around, and then, yeah, because you can't go in the bathroom.  Go in the bathroom.  Whatever.  Well, they say Black Mountain may have big dicks.  Holy shit.  Do they say that?  Tyga Woods does, I hear.  Hey, know what I noticed?  He has an XFL fucking sweatshirt on.  Oh, does he?  Hold on.  Pops.  That's where they went.  Pops, open up your jacket. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's an XFL Hitman sweatshirt.  That's a Hitman sweatshirt.  From the default XFL.  Wow.  God.  It's probably one my ex-wife threw away.  Hey, Pops, you got a skill?  We got a little talent show going on today.  What do you got for us?  What do you do?  What do you do?  Yeah, what do you do for us as far as the talent goes?  Besides taking a gig out.  For a little entertainment.  I'm sorry, but I ain't getting that for y'all.  Can you punch white girls in the face?  Watch your mouth. 
[01:44:00]  Watch your mouth.  Watch your mouth.  Watch it.  Watch your mouth.  Watch it.  You got a filthy mouth, sir.  That's okay, but there's teeth in them.  And there sure is.  You look terrible.  He said that to Sandy.  And he's homeless.  I know, a homeless guy saying you look terrible.  Look at you, honey.  How can you talk? 
[01:44:30]  Look at that outfit you're wearing.  What was that safety pin over there?  That's my good luck charm.  That's my good luck charm.  What kind of good luck charm is that?  You have it on backwards.  I'm mind if I take it and piss something.  He bought that for my age, Steven Singer.  So you're a good lover, huh?  Yes.  So you're fucking an asshole.  What do you like?  Oh.  I like the front.  The front.  They made me a young girl.  Okay.  How old do you like her?  Twelve. 
[01:45:00]  No.  He's a pedophile.  Excuse me.  Excuse me, Miss Lady.  Yeah.  I'm not a, what you?  Pedophile.  You don't even know the word.  Okay.  That means, okay.  Yeah.  How old do you like women?  Oh, twenty-five.  Okay.  So that's you to the third power.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Is she, Pops, is she a little too old for you?  Is she a little too old for you?  Hell no.  You'd have to fuck her from behind so you don't look at her.  Yeah, do it for me.  Yeah, do it for me.  Yeah, do it for me.  Yeah, do it for you.  Look.  Ugh.  He's turned away.  Sandy just lifted a skirt up and he's wincing. 
[01:45:30]  And he's out of a dumpster.  I know, I know.  He sweeps and pukes.  Do you have any shit stains in there?  Let me shit stains.  Yeah, you shit stains, you girls.  Is that all you think about when you see a woman's ass is shit stains?  Yours.  What do you think about?  I say.  I say, you know.  You have a dirty mind.  Yeah.  And a body.  And you got a dirty mind.  Hey, Pops.  Pops, $100 to have sex with her.  $100 cash. 
[01:46:00]  He's a bit my dick first.  You'll beat your dick first.  Really?  Yes.  Hey, Sandy Kane, you want to show him Twotto?  You want to see something, Pops?  We can't, though.  I just, I'm going to flash it.  Pops, you missed it.  Pops, look.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Pops, look.  I do see today.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Pops, look.  Show him.  Show him, Sandy Kane.  Come on.  Don't just flash it.  Lift it up.  Lift it and leave it up.  No, no.  Lift it.  Come on.  I want to see that.  Lift it and send me.  You want to say anything like that?  It's like Santa's beard down there.  Lift the damn thing up.  Ow.  Ow. 
[01:46:30]  Lift the damn thing up.  Okay.  So you like the front?  Huh?  I have a very big twine.  Ugh.  I do.  I haven't heard a girl say that before.  It must be coming out of your mouth, but it's short.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, you're terrible.  Man.  Your face is just stuck.  When was the last time you got laid?  Yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Yesterday.  Young girl.  Yeah, I bet.  Oh, she looks much better than you do.  That's a goddamn talk. 
[01:47:00]  What highway is she laying off of?  Who would fuck you?  Okay.  I have a second.  Who would fuck you?  Come on.  Let's get real, baby.  Anybody who fucked me, give me some money.  I've got damn money.  Let's see.  Give me some damn money.  Oh.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  This homeless guy with cash.  Jesus Christ.  He's got a MetroCard.  Yeah, I know.  Cell phones, credit cards.  Yeah.  Oh, that guy.  20 legs of lamb.  Yeah, 20 legs of lamb.  You've got to fuck your mouth, too. 
[01:47:30]  No, I don't.  I don't use profanity.  He does have a filthy mouth.  You do, sucker.  Don't fuck your mouth.  Smack that motherfucker.  I don't use profanity.  Hey, smack him.  You know where he got his money?  Hit him in his chin.  Hit him in his chin.  I can't do that.  Huh?  I'll go to jail.  No, hit him in his chin.  If you can find it, go ahead.  No, I won't do that.  I mean, I respect him, man.  There you go.  All right.  That's okay.  That's nice.  That's Pops, everyone.  Pops.  We've got a lot of homeless guys.  Yeah, we've got to get to a few other homeless guys.  What do we have, Pops, in the talent show as? 
[01:48:00]  I guess a little spoken word comedy.  Yeah, we're going to have to think about that while we introduce some of the other guys.  He's taking his stool, which is pretty funny.  It's ironic that he carries around a stool.  What do you mean?  Shut it, Jim.  Yeah?  Ooh.  Oh, damn.  Why don't you go out there, turn it over, and find three friends?  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, you know that old joke.  Oh, come on.  What? 
[01:48:30]  I'm rubbing your glue.  What the fuck is that?  Let's go find three friends.  I'm rubber, you stink.  Wait.  Can we give him money?  He's got money, right?  We give him something?  Oh, please.  He'll be back.  He's got more money than us.  Yeah.  Well, you know what happened there.  Hey, Pops, come here.  Wait, we've got to give Pops something.  Oh, hell.  Give me a Hyundai.  What?  Bring Pops.  Pops is going to be tough to follow.  Bring Pops.  Hold on.  We're just giving them money as they go.  Oh, here we go.  Pops.  Hey, Pops.  Bring back in Greer Barnes.  Merry Christmas, brother. 
[01:49:00]  Merry Christmas.  Thank you.  $100 bill.  Oh, it's legit.  That is real.  Yeah, it's real.  He's checking it.  He's checking it if it's real.  That's real.  Yeah, Pops.  That's real, my brother.  He's having one for my health care.  Yeah, you want one, Rich?  Yes, I want one.  Spirit of taking advantage.  Come on.  Be a fucking...  Here you go, Rich.  Rich took it.  We were in my hotel last night.  All right.  Hello, miss.  How are you?  Hi.  My name is Sandra.  Hi, Sandra.  What's up, Sandra?  I'm 45 years old.  Yeah?  And I always want to do this rap in front of people.  Oh, damn. 
[01:49:30]  Okay, here we go.  Wait, wait.  We want to know about you a little bit.  We need a little bio about you.  We need a little bio.  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Are you wearing a bra?  I've been hanging around Port Authority for like 15 years off and on.  Why are you homeless?  Did you do drugs?  Well, I did drugs at one time, but I've been clean now for like eight years.  Get out real.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm on my way to hopefully being unhomeless.  Are you sober?  So you could be clean?  I'm sober as well.  Good for you.  You're clean now because you have gambling to fall back on, right?  Oh, yeah.  I love Empire City.  I can't do any work. 
[01:50:00]  Empire City is great.  You didn't.  That's my favorite place.  Okay, so we're in Port Authority, hang in Port Authority, and you want to do a rap in  front of people?  Yes.  Okay, Sandra.  Wait, wait.  One question.  You ever do time at Rikers?  Oh, plenty.  Fuck.  For what?  For what?  Drugs.  Yeah, yeah.  Right on.  Yeah.  All right, here's Sandy from the Port Authority doing her rap, everyone.  From the time I was only six years old, I never forgot what I was told.  And with the best advice that I ever had, it came from my wise and dear old dad. 
[01:50:30]  He said, sit down, girl.  I want to talk to you, I want to talk to you, and don't say a word until I'm through.  There's a time to laugh.  There's a time to cry.  There's a time to break.  There's a time to chill.  To act civilized.  To act real ill.  Where do white women at?  Whatever you do in your lifetime, you never let an emcee steal your rap.  So, from six to six to this very day, I always remember what he had to say.  The thing that separates you from me, that is called originality.  That's what I'm saying.  You use your tongue, Vernier, and a $20 whore. 
[01:51:00]  And you people at home don't even realize she gave birth as she was singing that.  Do you have implants?  These are real lives.  Do you have implants?  Good question.  Wait a minute now.  How are we going to do this?  We have other talent to judge.  It's a talent show, so we have some different people to bring in.  Is it really right?  So you're going to stick around, right?  You can't leave.  Don't leave.  We have to bring some other people in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hang out backstage.  Here you go.  That was very good.  That's just for participating. 
[01:51:30]  From all of us, you get $100.  Just for participating.  Rich, give me that $100 back.  I gave it to you, and I want it back from my hotel.  All right, here.  Here, take this $100 right here.  Stop it.  Who's next, Sam?  Oh, this gentleman we met last week.  Oh, yeah.  How you doing, man?  Good morning, everybody.  How you doing?  How you been?  Good?  What's your name for the audience?  Good morning, Joe.  Joe?  Yeah, that's Joe.  What's up, Joe?  Mustard's friend, Joe.  Joe was in with mustard.  Yeah, I remember that.  Here you go.  Happy holidays, Joe.  Thanks.  Happy holidays.  He's giving him a candy cane. 
[01:52:00]  That's what he wants, Bobo.  All right, Joe.  So, Joe, where do you stay?  On the street, you know, Penn Station, Varric Street, you know, Varric Street is kind of  windy, so I ain't been sleeping there lately.  It's cold.  What do you do to keep warm in this awful 18-degree weather?  Just layers?  Layers.  Basically, you know, but it's still cold.  What can you do, you know?  Nice trench coat, though.  Yeah, this one.  Yeah, actually, I got this at Mike's station. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, uh-huh.  I got this at some motherfucker in the face.  Do you have family up here?  Right now, there's a lawyer shivering with no clothes.  Do you have family up here?  In the city?  Yeah, in New York.  No, I have family in Jersey and down south.  I want to thank Rich for the serious question.  No, I'm saying, why are you heading to Florida, man, to Miami?  What the fuck?  Everybody says that.  A lot of people say, go where it's warm at.  I mean, you know, basically sleeping on the street, whether it's warm or cold, is really  not a good thing. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, how do you make a few bucks every now and then to keep yourself in food?  Sometimes I work.  Sometimes when I'm laying on the ground asleep, you know, somebody just might give me a dollar  or two, but, you know.  Yeah, that's pretty decent.  What's the most money you made in a day, do you know?  Remember?  Working?  No, just getting...  Some people.  Some people.  Twelve hours.  That's it.  No one's ever given you a 50 or a 100?  Nah.  You don't panhandle?  You don't solicit money?  Nah, you know, like, I'm not going to say I never ask, because I have.  Yeah.  But I basically tell somebody, ask somebody, buy me a coffee. 
[01:53:30]  I get frustrated.  Like, excuse me, you got a quarter, you got a tight.  So I just take that home.  The Rich love the score.  Yeah, yeah.  I get mad at myself.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, Joe.  I'd leave it alone.  Now, you know this is like a talent show, or you get...  Nah, I didn't know, but now I know.  Oh, you didn't know?  Nah, uh-uh.  Nah.  It's like a little...  It's a...  Everyone does a little something, and there's prize money, and you know...  Okay, so can I strip?  No.  Now you can do whatever you want.  You can punch her in the pussy.  Joe, what do you think of her?  Yeah, what do you think of this mess in the front row? 
[01:54:00]  Wait, get a mic up.  Hold on.  Hold on, Teddy.  Somebody fucking help us out here, please.  Joe in the fucking house.  Thank you.  I just...  Why don't you go to Welfare and get money?  I got Medicaid.  I mean, Welfare, they don't give you that much.  That's cool.  They give you enough.  They do?  How much they give you?  Enough to...  I mean, I've been there.  I've been on Welfare and...  Wow, really?  ...hotels and got raped.  Whoa.  She says it like it's a plus.  I know.  Get out of here.  No one would rape you. 
[01:54:30]  That's what he's saying.  Yeah.  He got raped by a black guy.  I think the guy was raped.  And he climbed through in my window, and he raped me.  His name was Melvin.  Then the cops...  He even told you his name.  You know his name was Melvin, Sam.  Oh, you whipped it on him, and he just...  He had a nice dick, too.  Melvin?  But anyway...  Anyone else catch that Melvin?  No, he jumped on top of me, and then I called the cops, and the cops wanted to rape me,  too.  So, it wasn't...  She's fucking delusional.  Must be some good stuff.  I don't know.  Where was this? 
[01:55:00]  Blindville?  Blotter, Ashton Town?  All right.  I didn't really mean where was it.  Did it prior rape you?  Didn't you say...  It was called the St. Moritz.  Yeah, she's totally...  Right now, Melvin is talking somewhere.  I snuck into a window and had sex with a skeleton, and it talked.  Yeah, he doesn't consider it rape.  A lot of times.  Hey, Joe, would you have sex with her?  Oh, look at his eyes.  You don't have to be polite.  You don't have to be polite.  She can take it.  I'm not drinking and drugging right now, so... 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  Yeah, that's what it was.  You can take, right?  With that, Joe.  Just for coming by, you get a Hyundai.  Yeah, just for hanging.  Merry Christmas.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Don't worry about it.  It's cool, man.  Joe wants to say something.  Joe wants to say something to everybody.  I just want to let y'all know that I appreciate y'all letting me come up here again.  Yeah.  But actually, yesterday I was kind of mad because I didn't know what was going on.  Yeah, we were too.  But he explained it to me about the mall thing, you know, because I was looking forward  to maybe getting some food and coat and stuff like that. 
[01:56:00]  But I guess I can get some boots, you know, so...  No, we might give you more, too.  I appreciate it.  Stick around.  Don't stick around.  Stick around.  We'll hook you up with something.  All right.  Yeah, see, these homeless guys really were counting on this.  Yeah, they were counting on the malls.  And remember, super fucking malls.  Meeting makers make it.  All right.  Who do we got next?  All right.  All right, cool.  I need a coffee.  Somebody's working their way in here.  Okay.  All right, good. 
[01:56:30]  This is...  Oh, my God.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Bob Kelly.  Jesus.  Wait a minute.  I thought it was a bitch, Gerald.  I was kidding myself.  Excuse me.  Oh, yeah?  I'm a man, especially the elementary junior.  I'm a rebel without a clue to open your mouth.  A rebel without a clue, too?  Yeah, without a clue to open your mouth.  Once you get over there in front of the crowd a little bit, and let's get a little interview 
[01:57:00]  thing going on.  Danny, is this the gentleman?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do I think?  I don't know.  So, sir.  What are you guys doing?  Sir?  Oh, man.  He's fucking dumb.  Oh, they're doing good.  I don't know.  What's your name, sir?  Prospero D.S.  Lamando Jr.  Oh, okay.  I was born in Roa City, Capes, in the Philippines.  Oh, in the Philippines.  Yeah.  I'm not exactly sure.  It was 48 hours.  That was a long time ago.  Oh, we were 17.  I was in Chicago, Illinois.  You went to Chicago?  Oh, my destination.  I put, or entry was Hawaii. 
[01:57:30]  We were terrible.  They won't let us out the plane.  Like, we were...  A lot of a plane?  Wrong island.  Wrong island?  Yeah, because, okay, you go to Japan, they would not let us out the plane anymore.  That's a Japanese call where I live.  Wrong island.  Because it takes too long.  I feel like I'm watching usual suspects.  I'm a man only, I guess.  Sir, how long have you been homeless?  I don't remember.  When, uh, I think when my brother lost his job and had to move to Houston, because he's 
[01:58:00]  got a job in Grand Bar, Texas, you know, for some reason I got into, uh, he was a draftsman.  He turned into an electrical engineer.  So how did that end up with you being homeless?  I don't know what to talk about that.  Come on.  I'm just wondering.  I'm sorry.  Just wondering how you became homeless.  I don't know.  You don't know?  One day you had a home, and the next day you didn't.  It's kind of like, uh, it's like meant to be.  Meant to be?  Yeah.  I started, like, hearing things. 
[01:58:30]  I mean, assaulted.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, you hear voices and stuff?  I didn't realize I'm the one making those noise.  Oh.  My God, my God, man.  What the hell is this, you know?  What were the voices saying in your head?  No, it's not voices.  It's like, yes, uh, no, I didn't know voices.  Voices.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do they tell you sometimes?  I go straight to the point.  I don't know what you're trying to talk.  All right?  Hey, all I'm talking about your voice, right?  You're the only voice.  Oh, okay.  Have you ever heard of Jim Florentine? 
[01:59:00]  What's wrong with the psychiatrist?  What's wrong with the psychiatrist?  Over and over and over.  What did the psychiatrist say?  I don't know.  He asked me a stupid question over and over.  How many times do I have to ask that question?  Oh, my God.  What question?  I said, same question.  They ask whatever, like, for example, I don't even remember the question why.  It's, for example, like, you're hearing voices.  Yeah.  After a while, yeah, I mean, you keep hearing your voices.  It's annoying because it's the same question.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  You know, it's like one time I went to detox in New Orleans.  Boy, you've seen the world.  I know.  I like to travel.  World traveler.  So you went to detox in New Orleans.  Man, I want to be a rebel without a clue.  I heard that.  That's his catchphrase.  It costs money for my medication.  Do you do any singing or any musical instruments?  Oh, no.  No?  I don't know.  Do you have any talent?  Like...  I mean, I...  Can you tell us a joke?  How about a joke?  Who do you like working better with?  Wesley?  Wesley. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, Rich.  It was funny.  I don't mind.  I think, no, I know what I look like.  I could be a comedian, but...  Oh, yeah?  I'm late, all right.  Well, let's hear a joke.  It's never too late.  How old are you?  I'm for free.  You got a joke?  You got a joke?  Maybe tell a joke.  Oh, yeah.  I'm joking right now.  Tell a joke to the people.  This really could be John Leguizamo doing a character.  It really could be like a one-man show.  I know.  I was trying.  I think I saw this on Off-Road.  I know.  I'm with the United States of America.  I was going to vote for Obama, but, hell, no. 
[02:00:30]  I'm not going to be a city.  You want to put your hand in the scriptures and then please the region, I mean, like religion.  Oh, yeah.  I hear you.  I'm going to get rid of him.  Anyway, I want to change the name of the country before I...  To what?  It's too long.  To what?  I mean, yeah.  What do you want to change the name to?  I'm sorry?  What do you want to change the name of the country?  I don't know.  America or Antistatum America or Antistatum America or Antistatum America or Antistatum  America.  Who cares?  I don't know.  That's what I say.  Because it's a lie to me. 
[02:01:00]  United States of America.  Yeah.  I mean, especially how they get this country.  I mean, the city.  Yeah.  I mean, it was written in English and German over there, but, you know?  Then what?  What does it say?  I mean, straight to the point, really.  Then what happened?  No, it was a lie.  What was the lie, though?  How they get this country is they trade these gold beads.  Oh, for beads.  Yeah.  Yeah, they get the Indians beads and then we got the country.  Fair deal.  That's how Steven Singer works.  The treaty about the American...  Give him some beads, he gives you diamonds, and then he goes, why am I broke? 
[02:01:30]  Okay.  That's breaking the casinos, the Paxwood version.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Let's...  Now you're talking.  There's a treaty for the American Indians.  American Indians got their own welfare system, right?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Where's the American Indians there?  The slaves.  No, they're making a lot of money with the casinos.  I don't know about that.  I mean, they...  Oh, they're making a lot of money off of me, you know.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  What the hell are they doing over there?  There's a treaty.  They're breaking a treaty.  I hate to tell you, but I dumped about 50 large there once.  No, I'm talking about... 
[02:02:00]  Maybe I should have told him that.  What the casino may go to American Indian, a new welfare system.  All right.  Well, that's wonderful.  I'm understanding a moron.  Yeah, I know.  Yes, of course you are.  We have so many more homeless guys, so we got to...  All right.  What was your name again?  What's your name?  Barrow makes grace, right?  And what's your catchphrase?  What do people call you out on the street?  Sparrow or Johnny.  Sparrow?  Sparrow.  What?  It's Johnny.  Can I name it?  Captain Jack Sparrow?  Sparrow.  Johnny Brook?  Bing.  My nickname is Bing Bing B-N-G.  Bing Bing Bing Bing.  Bing Bing, yeah. 
[02:02:30]  All right.  Okay.  I don't know.  Give him a hundred and...  Yeah, there we go.  You're giving him that hundred?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, I want the one with...  I want the one with...  I hear you.  All right.  I was just saying, but I hear it.  All right.  Give the guy...  Let's bring in...  Let's bring in the next gentleman.  The next gentleman.  Come on.  Don't leave.  Let's take it too long.  Come on.  Let's go.  I'm trying to do something.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You got...  All right.  Here's your...  Here's your hundred, sir. 
[02:03:00]  That's...  Oh, shit.  Well, here's your hundred.  Thank you for coming by.  What?  It's a dollar.  Boy, he's very lucid now, isn't he?  A hundred.  A hundred.  There's a hundred.  I was trying to give him a dollar.  That's legit.  Boss will take it.  That's a hundred dollars.  Oh, man.  He's very happy.  It's like the price is right.  Yeah.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Now he hates America.  I know.  What the fuck?  Now, isn't that a fun person to be stuck alone in a van with?  That's the guy...  Wow.  That's exactly what he's saying as he walked away from you. 
[02:03:30]  That guy was drunk.  His liver was big and swollen.  I think we should take...  He was bad-mouthing management.  We should take a break and get to the rest of the homeless guys.  Yeah, we got to do that.  I know they're restless, but let's take a quick break.  We got restless.  I don't want to watch some of them OD.  Yeah, I don't want to lose that.  Why, Rich?  Why?  All right, quick break.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show, Rich Voss, and Florentine, and a bunch  of our listeners.  Scotty.  Scotty's in Springfield.  Stay right there.  This is terrible.  Opie and Anthony's Homeless Talent Show is presented... 
[02:04:00]  Is it the talent show?  ...is presented by PennyStockChaser.com and sponsored in part by, of course, IHateStevenSinger.com.  That's right, Anthony.  And wow, what a show we have today.  Unbelievable.  Just beating up Sandy Kane during the break.  Just a tad.  Just a little bit.  Sandy, are you enjoying the show?  Well, you know, I'm into S&M because you guys keep me in fucking stitches.  Hey, Intern David, what do you think?  What's your observation so far? 
[02:04:30]  It's a good show so far, but I want to see the homeless people actually do a real talent.  I'm looking for that.  Yeah, well, we were looking for that out of you for the whole time.  We didn't get it.  Oh, no.  You don't have the disappointment.  Yeah, you don't have a talent.  What do you want?  You have nothing, right?  Right.  All right.  You want to meet more homeless people?  Of course.  He just gets down on himself.  It's all right, David.  So what?  It's all right, David.  Everybody's not meant to be good on the radio.  That's right.  Or in anything else in life.  Why'd you have to do that? 
[02:05:00]  That was just plain mean.  Yeah.  Jesus.  We happen to like David very much, and we don't like you.  Let's meet the next.  David, do you need $100?  Nah.  I'm good.  Yes, you do.  Hanukkah money.  Can I pay for my hotel room?  Give David $100.  Dave, would you like $100?  You are holding us.  Yeah, give it to him.  There you go.  There's $100.  Oh, thank you very much.  No problem.  What are you going to get with it?  Put it right in here, baby. 
[02:05:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Look, it says, I hate Steven Singer inside.  Don't you feel like a cunt?  You had it and you lost it.  Like your foreskin.  It's Jewish.  Like terrestrial radio.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  What did you say?  Like what?  Telestial.  Say it.  You actually had it.  Like testicular radio.  Say it.  You actually almost had it.  You had it.  Say it again.  Terrestrial radio. 
[02:06:00]  Terrestrial.  Terrestrial.  Terrestrial.  What?  Whatever the fuck it is.  No, you almost had to say it.  Uh, fucking regular.  No, say it.  Terrestrial radio.  Say it.  Terrestrial radio.  Let's hear it.  One more time.  What the fuck?  One more.  Terrestrial radio.  Ah, there we go.  Wow.  Is that it?  He put a K in terrestrial.  Why don't we bring in?  We only have two more homeless guys?  Terrestrial dystrophy.  Oh, fuck.  We're up to the star of the show.  Yeah.  And, uh, and his boyfriend.  Ladies and gentlemen, uh, they're cute.  Wow.  This guy came in about a week ago. 
[02:06:30]  He did, uh, his version of Creep.  Radiohead's Creep.  Damn fucking video went viral without us even pushing the damn thing.  Uh, it's Mustard, everyone.  Mustard.  Here he is.  Or Eastside Dave from the future, as we like to call him.  Looks like Zach.  What's up, Mustard?  How are you, brother?  Looks like Zach Galanavkis.  What the hell is his name?  He's Galanavkis.  Oh, look at that.  He's got a sexy look with the pants.  Easy access.  Yeah, right.  No, I need new pants.  Come on.  What happened?  Yeah.  Last night, I passed it on the Q train, and somebody took all my stuff. 
[02:07:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  I have nothing.  I have never.  I took all your shit?  And I have ripped pants.  Wait.  Doesn't that suck?  What did you have?  Like, that they took?  That was like.  Clothes, mostly.  A big bottle of vodka.  I'm really busted up.  Oh, shit.  Because I'm way too sober right now.  Yeah.  Hey, Mustard.  Now, obviously, you came in and just blew everyone away with your musical talent.  You've seen the videos online, I hear.  The response online has been amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they're all just all about you right now.  Yeah.  They're just praising you. 
[02:07:30]  I've got like almost 200,000 hits on YouTube.  It's crazy.  And can you explain to everyone that wasn't your fucking guitar?  I'm sick of it trying to explain it on the video.  Everyone's like, oh, good.  It wasn't my guitar.  It's like, oh, really?  You're like a homeless guy with a tailor?  Oh, with a guitar.  Yeah.  When I came here, I had a fucking $1,000 Takamini.  That got stolen like the second day I was here or something.  You shouldn't fall asleep so much.  I know, man.  You've got a lot of hospital bracelets.  And I've lost many.  I've had many, many more.  What, do you just collect them?  Yeah.  Try to collect all of them? 
[02:08:00]  Well, I collect, you know, just stuff.  And so I started collecting the hospital bracelets, too.  And you want to introduce us to...  This is my friend Boris, my boy.  He also plays guitar, but he broke his thumb.  And he's a man of few words, so I doubt he's going to say a whole lot.  That's it, huh?  But he's got a really cool story.  He's got a very interesting story.  Really?  What's your story there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Kind of looks like Jimmy Fallon a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Oh, wow, yeah, yeah.  You remember Yakov Smirnoff?  Remember the comedian?  Yeah, sure.  He's a cross from Yakov Smirnoff and Jimmy Fallon. 
[02:08:30]  Right?  And are you guys an item?  We're like partners.  You know, we were all on the streets together.  We watched his back.  Although he was not watching my back last night.  Apparently not.  Son of a bitch.  Damn.  How long have you been on the streets, man?  He's been on the other since I was a kid.  Yeah, like four years.  Really?  Yeah.  And how'd that happen?  I was homeless when I was 15.  So I was like 18 the first time.  And then recently since 08 till 8.  So I'm still homeless.  Yeah, yeah.  That's got to suck. 
[02:09:00]  Homeless.  Where are you from originally?  How many homeless do you?  Oh, Ukraine.  Ukraine?  Yeah.  Yeah.  From Kiev.  Oh.  Hey, comrade.  Yeah.  So, Buster, everyone wants us to produce like an EP for you.  Please do.  Yeah?  That would be good.  I would enjoy that.  You can keep your shit together enough to get this done?  Yeah.  Because Anthony doesn't think it's possible.  No, who was saying that?  He doesn't really want me to take on this project because he thinks you'll eat my face.  No, someone else was saying that. 
[02:09:30]  Who else was in here that day?  Patrice.  Oh, Patrice.  Yeah.  The only one I bite is him, actually.  Wow.  Wow.  Show him your thumb, yeah.  You bit his thumb?  Well, he tried to bite my thumb.  I hear you're a biter.  Yeah.  Like, I've heard you just like, argh.  Well, apparently I bit a cop, too.  I don't remember, but a cop train.  And I'm supposed to record you.  How much?  I don't get that wasted anymore, to be honest.  I was going through a really, really bad time.  Even worse than now.  We've got to get some kind of EP out there, a little iTunes action, and get you some money, 
[02:10:00]  man.  I don't need any of the money.  That would be great, man.  But let's fucking figure some out.  How many songs can you do?  I can do 50 songs.  I've written hundreds of songs.  What would be the smart way to go?  A little EP with a little sample?  Five or six songs, maybe?  You know, like, the four songs I did the last show.  The four songs you did were on iTunes.  I got another song that I'm going to do, a totally different song.  I got a couple other covers I do.  What other covers do you do?  Do you have any songs about being homeless?  Yeah, Trenches.  Yeah, I do.  I do a Britney Spears cover.  Which one? 
[02:10:30]  Hit Me Baby one more time.  Oh, fuck.  I would kind of like to hear that.  I don't remember it, though.  I was supposed to go online and look up the chords, and I can't remember them.  But I'll do it some other time.  We'll record that one.  No.  All right, we'll record that one.  Today, I'm going to do...  I guess I'm in on this now, Ant.  Where are we recording?  You're in.  I'm holding you to it.  You know, and that's a lot of what they're saying on the internet.  They're like, make sure Opie lives up to his word.  Make sure Opie lives up to his word.  Plus, there does go online.  Sandy, have you checked the P.S.  And they won't let you in the library anymore.  I think you're down a few pounds. 
[02:11:00]  Look at that.  You might have a leak.  Are you talking to our kids?  No, they're kind of like...  They're really flat today.  Look, look, Liv.  I need some work done.  Believe me.  Much work done.  I need some implants.  You're like an undertaker.  So I need some new shit going.  You're right, man.  I admit it, man.  Mustard.  You're depressed, aren't you?  Would you fuck her?  I need some breast implants.  No.  Mustard, you wouldn't fuck her?  We've met before.  We've met before about two years ago in a bar on the Upper West Side. 
[02:11:30]  Isn't it great that nine out of ten homeless people would not fuck Sandy Cain?  Didn't I blow you in the bathroom?  I don't remember.  You might have.  Who knows?  You were definitely blowing people in the bathroom.  Didn't I blow you in the bathroom?  How many times have I heard that?  I thought he looked familiar.  I thought he smelled familiar.  Oh, and I do smell.  I do smell.  That's for sure.  No, you smell good.  I like you.  Well, fuck, I want to hear Mustard.  What's the other cover you do?  Cure.  Cure of Boys Don't Cry. 
[02:12:00]  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  See, one of the first shows I played in New York when I first came to New York was a cover  show by a DJ called Xerox.  And the idea is to do covers that you wouldn't necessarily expect to do.  So I did Britney Spears.  I did Oasis.  Which Oasis?  Wonder?  Yes, Wonderball.  Nice.  Cure.  But I can't remember how to play any of them anymore.  Because I haven't played them for songs.  You sober the fuck up.  This is like three years ago.  I want to hear this shit. 
[02:12:30]  It's a little black guy, the Puerto Rican black guy.  No, no, no, no.  He's a little...  Oh, you guys want to hear Mustard play something today?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, can I sit down?  Wait, can I sit down?  I got to sit down.  Yeah, yeah.  Get a chair or some shit.  I'd rather sit on the ground, to be honest.  Well, wherever you want to sit, man.  I'm feeling home.  Yeah, wherever you're used to sitting, man.  We got to hook this guy up in some pants and shit.  Jesus Christ.  Get us some money.  Make sure...  Those things will go hand in hand, by the way.  Some pants and shit. 
[02:13:00]  Some pants and shit.  Make sure, you know, somebody's got to go and make sure he doesn't buy all vodka with  it.  This is something that we've grown accustomed to.  All right.  We got a mic.  Get a mic down.  Mustard has decided to sit on the floor.  Yeah.  His guy, Boris, is over there.  It's something I've grown accustomed to.  I do a lot of sitting on the ground.  I see a lot of babies, dogs, and shoes.  All day long.  Shoes.  Oh, yeah.  Shit, too.  Did Sandy say?  Yes.  Why?  Are you on the ground there, Sandy? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, I'm sure Sandy's been on the ground a few times.  Yeah, on her back.  All right.  Which way?  How should this go?  Let's go.  Wow.  I bet her tits could pick up colored comics in the paper and just squeeze them down, peel  up Dick Tracy.  As well as colored intruders.  I look at them, I'm hungry for pancakes.  Yeah.  So you feel in the latest distraction 
[02:14:00]  And you feel like you feel, but you don't know  Why is it real or just an overreaction  To watch your heart so close  And you forget how to see it clean  Pushing with the intersection 
[02:14:30]  Pulling out in all directions  Sorry to go on a search  But I mean that much  So you deal  In a regular fashion  With the fear of the fear that you fear the most  And you feel the same old normal reaction  I couldn't come too close  To watch you on it to  Be so real 
[02:15:00]  Pushing through the intersection  Pulling out in all directions  Sorry to go on a search  But I mean that much  And if you wanna feel the sunshine  You got to get out of the rain  But by the time you finally  That time to be mine  I'll be looking to unclutch a touch  Cause I mean that much 
[02:15:30]  So you deal  Right here  So you deal  In limited information  And you peel through the street  But you don't know  Is it real or just a hallucination  Like the Holy Ghost  Like the Holy Ghost  I got nothing left  To reveal 
[02:16:00]  Pushing through the intersection  Pulling out in all directions  Sorry to go on a search  But I mean that much  Sorry to go on a search  But I mean that much  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Sorry to go on a search  But I mean that much  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Oh, my God  Mustard, everyone 
[02:16:30]  Goddamn mustard  I'm way too sober  I'm totally shaking  Listen, I'm totally shaking  You're shaking?  He's shaking  Because he's a little too sober  Tell me I know that feeling  What do you think, Martin?  That was great, eh?  Not bad  Amazing  Really funny  Yeah, you really are shaking  You all right?  You all right?  You're shaking pretty bad  I think it's because he's at eye level  Of Sandy's crotch  That's why I'm shaking  Why are you down there?  Oh, jeez  Her tits are awful  I'm like, for instance 
[02:17:00]  They really are  Mustard, would you go down on Sandy  For a recording contract?  You would have a contract with like  With Warner Brothers  Warner Brothers  You put an album out  But you have to eat a box  For a half hour  Wow  I'll give you 20 minutes  How's that?  Then that's only an EP then  He'll take the EP  That's the contract  With Satan Records  Making a deal  You got one more in you, you think?  I'm going to hear that cover, maybe 
[02:17:30]  All right, let's hear this  I would say I'm sorry  If I thought  That it would change your mind  But I know that it's too late  I've said too much  Now I've been too unkind  And I try to laugh about it  Cover it all up with lies 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I'm gonna try to laugh about it  Hiding the tears in my eyes  Cause you know boys don't cry  Cause you know boys don't cry  Boys don't cry  Boys don't, boys don't cry  I would break down at your feet  I would beg forgiveness  I would play with you 
[02:18:30]  But I know that it's no use  There's nothing left that I can do  And I'll try to laugh about it  Cover it all up  Well, I'm gonna try to laugh about it  Hiding the tears in my eyes  Cause you know boys don't cry  But I'm  Boys don't cry  Na-na-na 
[02:19:00]  Boys don't, boys don't cry  Boys don't, boys don't cry  It's been a long time since I've played that sound  You have to excuse me  And I play it as a boy who actually does cry  I'm a crybaby  They know me at the 6th Precinct as the crybaby  That's what they call me  Why do you cry a lot? 
[02:19:30]  I got like 50 fucking reasons to cry  You want a list?  Well, for starters, I'm homeless  You know, I got beat up as a kid  I got abused a lot  You know, people like to pick on me  You know, some of the cops at the 6th Precinct  Walk around telling people that I'm a crackhead  Just to fuck with me  One of your officers threw me on the ground one night  I'm McDougal  No way  Cause I asked his name  Really?  I asked him his names  Yeah, right, he's looking around later 
[02:20:00]  Did the guy say Keith?  No, it wasn't Keith  Keith is very nice  No, he's not  Well, you're right, you're right  He's just nice to me  You know what?  Your beard looks like my pussy  Oh, Jesus  There's no bugs  Non-sequitur  I don't think he could have chlamydia of the mouth, though  Yeah  Honestly, my face kind of does look like a pussy  I'm just trying anything, Jimmy 
[02:20:30]  I'm hurling  I'm just catapulting shit out there  Hoping it hits something  It's just fuck  Cause we're on satellite radio  So we can say things like pussy and fuck  We're just going to say it as much as we can  Mustard  Have you ever eaten anything bad  Like off the street?  You saw some food just laying there  And you're like, I'm hungry  I'm just going to eat it  People often leave food out for us  You know, like this morning  There's an air vent where we sleep often  That spits out a little bit of warm air  Where Keith picked us up 
[02:21:00]  And there was, you know  Like four bags of food  That people just leave  But have you ever seen something laying there  You go, I'm hungry  I'm just going to eat it  I've taken things like  You know, off the top of the garbage can  But like, you know  Not just food like random  That was pretty tough to eat  No, you just got to be drunk enough  So what would be worse  When you're drunk enough  What would be worse, Sandy's pussy  Or the thing you ate off the top of the garbage?  Sandy's pussy  No difference  I'm sorry, Sandy  When was the last time you got laid? 
[02:21:30]  Oh no, I get laid a lot  It's actually quite amazing  Every once in a while  Somebody picks me up off the street  Takes me home  Cleans me up  Beats me and fucks me  Really?  Yes  Get out of here  I'm serious  You believe that?  You believe that?  Yeah, we believe that  Sandy  We don't believe that you get it  It doesn't happen to you  Sandy, my boy here  He hasn't had any  He's in like seven years  He needs it  Really bad  Damn  What are you doing later?

[02:41:30]  Oh, shit.  $300.  Give me my fucking money.  $300?  $300 for a new guitar?  What about the stickers?  That's got to be another $50.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So give me $350.  I'd say $350.  Here's $300.  We were doing a fucking who thing.  Yeah.  We were doing a fucking who thing.  No one told you we were doing the who thing?  I'm not a fucking comic.  I'm a singer-songwriter.  You're not the who.  You're the what.  Yeah.  You're not the fucking money.  Come on.  Be nice.  Come on.  Why aren't you being nice?  No.  Because you took my fucking guitar and fucked it up, man. 
[02:42:00]  Be nice and apologize for being mean to me.  Mean to you?  It's about fucking time, Opie.  Well, your song's stunt, though.  I was just...  And so does my ass, but you didn't have...  I was just pumping up...  You want us to bash that in, too?  I was just pumping up the song a little bit.  That's all.  Just be nice to me and apologize for yelling.  You are being rude to me.  Because it is the holiday.  Apologize.  He makes me apologize.  You know, it would be like...  But it's only fair you apologize.  You are being rude to me.  Okay.  Give me my fucking money.  I apologize.  No.  No.  Hey.  I wasn't sincere. 
[02:42:30]  You were motherfucking me.  That's not nice.  It's the holiday.  Christmas right around the corner.  Fire up, man.  That's my...  Be nice.  Apologize.  I apologize.  All right.  I'll give you 50 for the apology.  No.  Give me...  No.  I want a new fucking guitar, man.  Is that a good apology, Jim?  I'm going to slam it.  Absolutely.  It's my baby, my fucking guitar.  Is it?  An acoustic guitar does not cost $300.  But hey, what the fuck do you know?  You're a fucking commie.  Ooh.  Take it out of the room.  Hey.  That's me.  You know what?  She got me.  That's your opinion. 
[02:43:00]  Florentine didn't do anything.  Florentine was being nice and didn't do anything to you.  Not yet.  It was Opie who scumbagged you.  No.  Opie, fuck you.  No.  Hold on.  Florentine told Opie to do it.  All right.  But Opie was the guy that did it.  Oh.  Florentine's...  Well, give me the fucking money, man.  Well, Jim did not give me the fucking money.  Please, don't say any more mean things.  But it was Jimmy's idea.  Hey, Sandy, you've got to apologize to me because you just said something very bad.  A lot of apologies.  Very hurt.  You need to happen at this point.  Very hurt.  Well, I'm fucking angry, man, because all you fucking comics, you really put down music  and everything. 
[02:43:30]  No, we like your music.  I love music.  We like music.  I love your music.  I'd love to have heard some out of you.  Yeah.  Rich was just saying that you should have...  Sandy, can I tell you what happened, really?  Rich was telling me to smash a guitar.  I'm like, I can't do it.  Yeah, leave it to him.  I can't do it.  I've been friends with her for a long time, and he said, just do it.  It'll be fun.  You know him.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  Yeah, he said it'd be fun.  You give me the $300, man.  Yeah, boss, stupid.  Yeah, come on, man.  Exactly.  You want me to give it to you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  $300, all right?  I'll give you $400.  $400, all right.  Yeah, you're going to get $400.  No, no, come on. 
[02:44:00]  Give me a fucking break.  Give me my fucking money, man.  You didn't apologize.  Give me a fucking apology, man.  Give me that fucking money, man.  You got me all nervous and stuff.  I thought we were having fun.  Three, hold on.  I'm going to give her $400.  Oh, my God.  Hey, you can give away ice in the winter.  You're from Jersey.  How good could you be?  Give her...  Ooh.  Zip, so it begins at zero.  Right, she got you.  That was...  Give her the money.  Just give her the money.  It's not money.  Come on, I want the real fucking shit.  These people know the real money.  Come on, man.  They've seen that shit on the screen. 
[02:44:30]  Well, boss is unfolding it right in front of her face.  Yeah.  Give me my...  President Singer.  I apologize.  Give me my fucking money.  Do you still love us?  I always will love you.  Aw.  Why don't you get the guitar and see if you can play it still?  Yeah, if we don't do Sandy, it's not total, baby.  It's not broken in half.  That's not a bad idea.  You know, if you just pass your bumper up on a car, you don't pay someone for a car.  It's not a bad idea.  Give me the money, man.  It's not a bad idea.  I'm going to get a new one.  I'm Geico for guitars.  Huh?  I'm Geico.  I say take the guitar and I see if you can still play it.  No, give it to her, Iraq. 
[02:45:00]  Give it to Sandy.  She's the artist.  Let's see if it at least plays.  Try playing it.  Just try it.  Now it's a weapon.  Let's at least see if it's...  There's still money in there, Sandy.  You can remember who says we'd fuck that hole.  It only has a hole, man.  Give me my fucking money.  I once saw Willie Nelson's guitar and have a hole in it.  Oh, it sounds great.  Opie and Anthony, they fucking suck.  They always fuck me up and I love them still, though.  It's Christmas time on ONA. 
[02:45:30]  And all I can fuck and say is fuck you ONA.  Hey, all I can say is fuck you ONA.  Everybody.  It still sounds fine to me.  Fuck you ONA.  All I can say is fuck you ONA.  Happy New Year.  Merry Christmas.  Well, it sounds fine to me, Sandy.  Yeah, exactly.  It sounds perfect.  It looks like JFK now.  So what? 
[02:46:00]  Go, Sandy.  God bless O and fucking A.  What would Christmas be?  How much did you give her?  I gave her 50.  All right.  New fucking guitar for Christmas.  Yeah.  Hello, Sandy.  Sandy, you know I did you a favor.  That's a shitty guitar.  Piece of shit.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you, Anthony.  Piece of shit.  He's talking to the guitar.  Nah, this is a great guitar.  My Yamaha.  I'll make it even 400.  You thank that guy, Steven Serra.  You want a lap dance? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, I don't want no fucking lap dance.  I'm just bummed the thing didn't shatter.  That was a hard guitar to fucking break.  You weren't putting it all in, is it?  Because I had to grab.  Right on the floor.  If you were to hit that floor a few more times, yeah, that'd come apart.  See a guitar come apart like that?  That's how the guitar creeps.  Let's do the whole music store.  Hey, fuck you, baby.  Ow.  Ooh.  Oh.  I didn't do nothing.  Yes, you do.  You're a great singer, too.  Hello.  Oh, I know.  Oh, it's fantastic.  You know what we need to make this better?  Put my money, baby.  Thank you very much. 
[02:47:00]  Thank you.  There's Sandy Kane.  There's Sandy Kane.  The mood here has gotten very sour.  Hey, Sandy, can you take one of those 50s and wipe your ass with it?  Ooh.  The room reeks.  Oh, she's going to do it.  Now I know never to put money in your mouth.  Okay.  Watch.  Yes.  Oh, no.  She has.  Someone's getting that.  Poor Sam Ash.  Watch Ben Franklin frown.  Poor Sam Ash.  She's wiping her ass with the money.  I can't believe they wanted to put curtains up. 
[02:47:30]  Hey, I used to do this in the strip clubs.  Let's see it, Sandy.  Are we good?  Now you can smell it.  We good?  E-Rock, smell the bill.  I ain't smell it.  E-Rock, just see if it's bad.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Smell that money.  Smell the money.  Smell that money.  Count the money.  It was right by my hemorrhage.  It was right by my hemorrhage.  You see how he repelled my hemorrhage?  You see how he repelled my hemorrhage?  He recoils.  It's like a smelling salt.  You can't even look at me, right?  It smells so bad.  All right, what do you want to do, Jimmy? 
[02:48:00]  Not the sense of sight.  I think that E-Rock has been great.  And I think that as a reward for his excellence, he should be given some of Voss's ear gunk.  Oh, wow.  That's not a bad idea.  I really think so.  Yeah.  You got to get the camera.  I don't know if I have any.  You always have some.  He always says that.  I don't know if I have any.  Yeah, tumor head.  Fucking dumpster juice.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  No, it's not that bad.  Oh, shit.  We have to smell her ass.  I know.  That's true. 
[02:48:30]  Because the receptors are a little numb.  Should we take a break and then we'll...  Oh, man.  We should take a break.  What a letdown.  Yeah, we'll take a break because we got some business to do.  Business to tend to.  Let's hear it for Sandy Cain.  She's old man and me and now she gets a better guitar than that piece of shit that she brought in today.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Are we back?  I think we're back.  All right.  Back.  I want to talk to the guy that has never heard of us before. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, right.  He got dragged in.  Who was it?  It was Tattoo Guy.  I want to know the observations of a guy that has never seen or heard of us before.  And it's good that he didn't just listen.  He got to actually see what goes on and everything.  Now, what's your name, sir?  My name is Chris.  Chris, you were dragged in by your friend, right?  That's correct.  What's your friend's name?  He's a big fan.  Justin.  Justin, okay.  Justin.  Now, you sat here for the last two, three hours. 
[02:49:30]  What's some of your observations about the show?  Everything I dreamed it could be.  Yes.  Ah, yes.  Are you now a fan?  Absolutely, yeah.  Okay.  Wow, that worked.  Cool.  All this and we got one new fan.  That's good.  Well worth it.  I'd tell two friends, but I don't have any.  He's already here, so we're good.  Cool.  Nice.  He's really enjoying himself.  That's good.  At least, you know, we got a little litmus test there.  Rich, where are you going to be? 
[02:50:00]  Let's get one good solid plug.  Ah, darn.  All right, wow.  This weekend at Scotty's in Springfield.  But come tonight because it might snow tomorrow, they say.  Friday and Saturday, Scotty's in Comedy Cove in Springfield.  Next week at Caroline's.  How do you fuck up the plugs?  Next week at Caroline's.  This is your livelihood.  I don't fucking know.  You know, Christmas Eve, Christmas, around there. 
[02:50:30]  Hold on, hold on.  For real, for real.  Comedy Cove this weekend.  Next week, Caroline's.  And New Year's Eve in Danbury at the Treehouse.  I'm not fucking around.  Get some people there.  Florentine's plugs are, I'm doing the gig in Lowell tonight.  It's sold out to Bayshore.  It's, where is it, Kenny?  It's the Bolton Center.  The Bolton Center.  You're doing much better, dummy.  No, no, I know that, but I'm already.  The Bolton Center.  And Florentine is going to be there on January 30th.  Saturday, January 30th.  The night before New Year's Eve. 
[02:51:00]  So you can catch Jim at the same place I'm going to be at tonight.  And he's also going to be Uncle Vinny's December 18th and 19th.  That's in Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  It's a 10 o'clock show each night.  And you can go to UncleVinny'sComedyClub.com.  Nice.  And my only plug is New Year's Eve, Fort Lauderdale Improv.  But wait a second.  I have no idea where anyone's going to be.  You said January.  No, but nobody.  People who live in the locations will know.  Yeah, they'll figure out.  It's January 30th, Bolton Center.  Did I say you said?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I said the night before New Year's Eve.  Oh, my God.  God.  I don't know when anyone's.  Okay, here's where Jim is.  Jim Florentine only. 
[02:51:30]  December 18th, 19th, Uncle Vinny's Point Pleasant.  That's tonight.  Paul Uncle Vinny.  Tonight, tomorrow.  He's a good boy.  And January 30th, which is a month after the night before New Year's Eve.  Oh, my God.  You can go to JimFlorentine.com to catch Jim's dates.  He'll be in the Bolton Center in Bayshore, Long Island, January 30th.  Will you read mine?  Yes.  We did yours already.  New Year's Eve, I'll be in Fort Lauderdale.  We'll do it again in a few minutes.  So, if you're in Florida, see me.  If you're in fucking New York, see Florentine. 
[02:52:00]  And if you're in Connecticut, see us.  Good news.  Sandy King got a talking to, and now she's behaving finally, so that's good.  Good.  You're back with us?  After your outburst.  Yeah, a big outburst there.  Yelling at the Canadians.  A lot of apologies.  Yeah, well, I am very bitter.  Why?  I bet.  Maybe that's why I smell bad.  You know, I'm very bitter.  All right.  What are we doing now?  Get the homeless people in here.  Let's bring the homeless guys back in.  Yes, let's do this.  Let's bring these lovely folks back in.  I want a grand finale. 
[02:52:30]  We have to split all the money between them.  Grand finale?  Yeah.  A big Christmas number.  Here's Mustard, everyone.  Mustard.  And Boris.  And I believe Joe.  Sandy.  How do we even remember their names?  I don't know.  Papa.  This guy's great.  Papa's great.  Papa rules.  And I couldn't figure out his name, but.  And this, like.  Wow.  This guy's insane.  Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods. 
[02:53:00]  Mustard.  I can't believe.  Is this on?  Yeah.  I can't believe you smashed her guitar.  I know.  I can't believe you did that.  There is a relationship a musician has with her instrument.  And that was, I think, a little over the top.  That was a bit.  I got to agree with that.  I didn't like it either.  And the look on your face when you turned around and saw, oh my God.  But she's got to be a musician for her to have.  That's true.  You said a musician has with an instrument.  She's not quite a musician.  I've heard available terms.  I'm available terms.  Mustard, for example, I wouldn't smash your guitar. 
[02:53:30]  I've never been so happy not to have a guitar.  That would be a shame with her.  It's a public service.  What's he doing?  All right, wait.  Papa wants a mic type.  I was better last time.  How y'all?  What's up?  Good.  Was he good?  Oh, he kicked ass, man.  He kicks ass.  He's very good.  You're the winner, sucker.  He's very good.  He's much too good.  I didn't.  Not you, Grandma.  Not you.  You don't get it.  Him and Sandy are at it again.  Oh, Sandy had a good one.  What, great-grandfather? 
[02:54:00]  That's terrible.  Oh.  Talking about you again.  But look at you, baby.  Damn.  Look at you.  Look at you.  Look at you.  Look at you.  How about we get some lights on these.  Uh-oh.  Grady's going to hit us.  Whatever you do.  Grady.  Don't help me show that to me.  It's about to fall to the ground and love will come back up.  He's talking about your tits, Sandy.  That's what real titties do.  No.  Real bad ones.  That's what real bad titties do.  Pops.  I'm feeding them.  Pops, I'm sure there's some stuff on you sagging, too.  Come on.  They're dick, too. 
[02:54:30]  Jersey Shore her.  I think Santa Cain's a racist.  Someone give Pop a mic.  Somebody get them a room.  How about we get both of these guys?  Hold on, hold on.  They both need a mic.  That's for sure.  Give him this mic.  Yeah.  With the cord on it.  With the cord.  The relationship a musician has.  All right.  He's going.  Okay.  Yes.  We can hear you.  All right.  What, Sandy?  The bad titties.  No.  I mean, he's probably had low balls.  Yeah.  Do your balls say pop?  Well, you got to talk into the mic.  Everything.  There you go. 
[02:55:00]  Everything on me stands up until you is falling down.  You're going to stay down.  You have a hard on right now?  Not yet, but if you're talking about it, we'll get there.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he's very erotic.  Yeah.  Oh, he's very erotic.  Oh, he's my type.  Yeah.  Let me see what that say.  Let me see.  Naked cowboy should have been naked, ugly cowgirl.  He should have been.  Well, a lot of people gave me a lot of money in the last two years being a naked cowgirl. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, my.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of fucking people.  Oh, excuse me.  Yeah.  Where was I standing when they were telling me all this shit?  Where was I standing?  I'm 46th Street and Broadway.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Here I am, motherfucker.  You must be.  I've seen her perform.  Yeah, there it is.  That was 25 years ago.  Look at me there.  I can't fucking stop it.  Look at my ass down.  Come on.  That's.  You're looking at a picture of her.  That's 25 years ago.  You look cool.  What do you know?  He looks terrible.  She looks terrible.  All the ugly men call me George Clooney like me. 
[02:56:00]  Sandy.  Sandy Kane, show him your ass.  I think you guys got off on the wrong foot.  Show him your ass.  Okay.  Show him your ass.  No, I think you got on the wrong foot.  No, look.  You got to look at it.  Look, it's not bad.  No.  Oh, you're looking.  Good Lord.  What's wrong with her ass?  Have a room with her ass.  Have a room with her ass.  Stand up.  But damn.

Hey, please.  Hey, don't touch a little bear with you.  Hold that shit up.  Okay?  Well, it's just a bad brassiere.  No, dude.  It's a bad fucking brassiere.  Is that because you're scared to spend your money on some good shit?  Well, it's a holiday costume shit.  Everybody sit on.  It's a holiday costume.  What's up, Victoria?  You look like a germ.  Go, go.  Sit down.  Look, he's talking, baby. 
[02:57:00]  You look like a germ.  What happened to your head?  You look like a germ.  He gets good head.  No, no, no.  Why don't you shine it at me?  I give a good dick out, and you won't like it.  A good dick, and you won't like it.  Yeah, all right, baby.  It's probably working hard anyway.  All right, Jesus.  Wow, these two.  I smell sitcoms and a lot of other things.  Don't get up.  If you get up, your jam, I won't walk with you.  I love you, too.

[03:03:30]  Why don't you eat that pussy?  Yeah, what's wrong with the pussy?  Because it's not tasty.  That's why.  Well, maybe hers isn't.  Oh, shit.  If a man don't eat pussy, he ain't a man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit, Pops.  Pops, what are you going to do?  Oh, shit.  What are you going to do?  It's been my heart.  Pops, you're saying you're not a man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's grabbing a Sharpie.  Yeah.  Man?  How you doing wrong?  He's drawing something on her breast.  Shit, what are you doing?  Oh, do you. 
[03:04:00]  Shit, shit.  Oh, I don't know what that is.  Do yourself.  He's a plastic surgeon.  Do you eat out?  No.  Do?  What did you write on her tits?  He wrote, do you.  Do you.  Do you.  Do you what?  You know what that means?  No.  No.  What?  No.  Do herself.  Oh.  I can definitely do it.  Do you.  My middle finger is like I'm married to it.  I've never seen anybody bomb with a marker.  Definitely.  Prom comic.  Get out of here.  What are you?  Demetri Martin?  I'd rather have a vibrator than you.  Well, once again, keeping true to form, the Opie and Anthony show just reaches the finish 
[03:04:30]  line and dies a horrible death.  Peters out at the finish line.  Yeah, we just.  What do you say that for, Pops?  There's a bunch of 20s in there.  Let's divvy up some cash.  Make sure.  Hold on, Danny.  You pop some money.  Guys and girls get some.  Oh, oh, oh.  I'm being reminded that Bobo did say he would make out with a guy today.  A homeless guy.  For $50.  Anyone want to make out with a. 
[03:05:00]  Wait.  For money.  For money.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's trying to kiss Pops.  Pops.  $50.  Pops will fucking pop him.  Oh, $50.  He's just pissed off Earl Monroe.  $50 if he makes out with you.  Mustard has volunteered.  Mustard has volunteered.  Mustard has volunteered to make out.  Bobo and mustard.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  We're not filming this?  Not yet. 
[03:05:30]  Not yet.  Clear the field.  Yeah.  Not yet.  D-Rock, get a good vantage point.  Not yet.  All right.  Get in there.  Danny.  Yep.  If you could move a little bit to one side.  This is a real.  Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  Okay, guys.  The big kiss between Bobo.  There's got to be some tongue.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to make out.  We must have been tested, right?  Yeah.  Mustard has been tested, right?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Come on. 
[03:06:00]  50 bucks.  Does it not a kiss?  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Yes, Bob.  Excuse me.  What the fuck was that?  What the fuck was that?  The worst kiss I've ever had.  We got a bad kiss?  Mustard.  What was that like?  Was it bad?  No, I couldn't get it. 
[03:06:30]  We made no contact the first two times.  Come on, Bobo.  You suck.  I had to, like, pull him in.  Bobo's swallowing candy canes.  Hell no.  Mustard.  How much do you give me a kiss?  Mustard, show him how to kiss.  Show him how to kiss.  Come on.  Show him how to kiss.  Teach him at least.  Come on, Bobo.  Learn how to kiss.  Come on, Bobo.  I didn't see any tongue.  Bobo.  He sounds like he's throwing up.  Come on, Bobo.  He's got a mouthful of candy cane with his awful Bobo breath.  Bobo, be good.  Oh, awful. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, look at his face.  Yeah, there you go, Bobo.  Talk to her.  She's freaking out.  What's her name?  Sandy?  I think I made a person who scard him.  I'm not sure.  Hey, ma'am.  Get her on mic.  Danny, get her on mic.  Get her on mic.  Yeah.  What did you think of that?  Horrible.  It was bad.  Disgusting.  Why was it disgusting?  I thought it was touching.  All right, Bobo, what's up?  Bobo has a hundred candy canes in his mouth. 
[03:07:30]  Why are you eating candy canes?  Bobo.  It's better than shit.  Bobo.  Bobo, why are you eating candy canes?  Because he doesn't like kissing that.  About breath.  Your breath is bad?  No, I have bad breath.  Why are you kissing a guy when you have bad breath?  Who has bad breath?  I do.  You do?  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Oh, wait.  Let's have E-Rock smell Mustard's breath.  I don't believe it's not.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  No, you don't smell my feet.  That's really sick.  E-Rock.  Wait, Mustard said you really must smell feet. 
[03:08:00]  All right, but E-Rock has to judge what's worse, Mustard's breath or his feet.  Get over there.  All right.  Come on, E-Rock.  Mustard's a trooper.  E-Rock, get over there.  Breath first.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me get this.  Mustard, you put your foot on the table.  Hold on.  Breath first, though.  I am working in the city.  You can hold your eyes.  Breath first.  E-Rock.  You can hold your feet on the breath.  Good.  You can hold your feet on the breath.  Wow.  What's the matter, E-Rock?  Now, get right up there. 
[03:08:30]  Get right on that foot, E-Rock.  Mustard, put the foot on the table.  Oh, shit.  Put the foot on the table.  Put the foot on the table.  Good.  Those are not new socks.  All right, E-Rock, get up there.  Get in there close.  Get in there.  What are you, queer?  Get in there.  You got it.  You got it.  You got it.  You're a foot away.  Wait, now, hold on. 
[03:09:00]  No.  Hold on, Mustard.  Mustard, put it back up.  Mustard, put it back up there.  Mustard, put it back up there.  No.  Bare foot.  Bare foot.  Bare foot.  Bare foot.  No.  No.  Come on, E-Rock.  Get up there.  Bare foot.  Bare foot.  E-Rock, get up there.  I really sucked that hard if I took it off.  All right.  Well, E-Rock, one more whiff.  Come on.  You're not doing a good job here, E-Rock.  Come on, E-Rock.  Get close.  I want to say, Sandy pointed out that although my socks are filthy,  there's no holes in them.  No holes. 
[03:09:30]  No holes.  Go, E-Rock.  Come on.  Get close now.  And more.  Come on.  Get in there.  Come on.  No, right on it.  Right on it.  Right on it.  You're still six.  Come on, E-Rock.  Take a whiff.  E-Rock.  Take a whiff.  All right.  You guys are fun, you crazy people.  Oh, E-Rock.  I can't believe they pay you for this.  I know.  They don't pay me for this.  Oh, you're an intern, right?  They abuse you.  I mean, I can't believe they pay them for this.  Wow.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Hey, Pop.  What the fuck? 
[03:10:00]  What's wrong with you, Pop?  You're about to fall out.  What the fuck is wrong with you, Gracie, motherfucker?  What's wrong with you?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  All right.  We've got to wrap up.  We've got to wrap up.  We're going to give the homeless a little bit of a...  We're Steven Singer.  He fucking sponsored this piece of shit, Joe.  I'm getting extra for that kiss, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this is...  I hate Steven Singer.  The guy responsible for the money.  By the way, for the homeless, a very easy target. 
[03:10:30]  He's got a lot of diamonds in his back pocket.  You might want to say hi to him when he hits the streets of New York.  Steven, what did you think of the show today?  I can't...  This is one of the proudest moments of my life.  I can't tell you.  Isn't it?  This is just terrific.  What was the highlight for you?  You know, when Sandy was dancing, that was terrific.  But then the kiss just eclipsed it.  Put it right over the top, right?  It was just like...  You like man-on-man kissing, right?  This has just been absolutely phenomenal.  How much are you giving them? 
[03:11:00]  I don't know.  We got more?  We're just passing it around.  Yeah, we're just passing it around.  Split it.  Whatever it is.  Yeah, we are.  We are.  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  It's being evenly distributed.  Steven Singer is talking.  Oh, okay.  I want to make sure the guys are getting their money.  That's fine.  Get yourself some goddamn warm clothes and shit.  Not all vodka.  Except mustard.  You grab some vodka.  Mustard likes vodka.  You get a...  Right.  Thank you, Steven Singer.  Let's hear it for Steven Singer.  Great job.  I hate stevensinger.com.  Thanks for having me, guys. 
[03:11:30]  Have a great vacation.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  And I guess that's it.  And thanks to all the...  Thank you to the homeless people for coming in.  How about a hand for the homeless?  Yes.  Also got to thank PennyStockChaser.com also.  Thank you.  Wow.  Is that mustard's feet?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that is...  Pop wants to say one more thing.  Oh, Pop.  Pop, you have the final word on the show.  No, no.  We have to give away that Burton snowboard real quick.  Okay.  No, you don't.  Where's the love board?  And what's the plug line for the snowboard? 
[03:12:00]  The love board.  All right, guys.  Listen.  Can we give it to someone in the room?  Does anybody snowboard?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Big A, do you need something to eat Italian ices with?  Why don't we do a quick raffle?  Just, I don't know, hand out numbers and we'll do the numbers and that.  Something.  We got a snowboard.  Not on the air.  What?  No, but I got to get the plug in.  Someone's going to win a love board from Burton snowboards here in studio. 
[03:12:30]  Check out the latest gear and find your local dealer at Burton.com.  Believe in snowboarding.  That's Burton.com.  We'll give away the snowboard to somebody here in a couple minutes.  Yes, Pops.  Yes, Pops.  Where's that microphone at?  Right here, Pops.  Who in the fuck are you?  Steven Singer.  Who?  Steven Singer.  That's Steven Singer.  He came up with the money.  Yeah, he's...  Thank you, sir.  There you go.  A little fist bump for him there.  I don't know where the fuck to get on and kiss it and shit. 
[03:13:00]  I found another star.  This guy's got to come back.  I love Pops.  You lost your goddamn mind.  I think I just found my new spokesman.  Look at Keith's looking like a proud papa.  And you're the same.  You're the same.  All right.  We're going to get out of here, guys.  Yeah, let's take off.  Everybody, thank you so much.  Great having another live crowd.  It was a hell of a year.  Good seeing you.  2010, CNFC on this, everybody.  Yeah! </pre>
