<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic, highly offensive, and wildly varied affair.  It began with a discussion of Mel Karmazin's departure from Sirius XM, eliciting mixed feelings of gratitude and resentment from the hosts.  This segued into rampant speculation about Donald Trump's anticipated announcement, fueled by rumors of a supposed Obama divorce.  The hosts then launched into an angry and profane discussion of recent violent crimes, expressing outrage over the perpetrators, the parole system, and what they saw as societal failures.  They briefly touched upon other news items, including the World Series, Carlton Fisk's DUI, Kurt Schilling's financial woes, and Antoine Walker's bankruptcy.  A bizarre story about a children's film being mistakenly replaced by a horror film at a movie theater was also mentioned.  Pat Cooper was announced as a later guest.

The show continued with seemingly nonsensical, racially charged and offensive ramblings before unexpectedly transitioning into a studio performance by Chubby Checker with Sabra Cadabra, performing "The Twist."  The hosts recounted the negotiation process, highlighting Checker's initial exorbitant fee demand.  The conversation then shifted to Bill Wyman's birthday, age, and retirement from the Rolling Stones, followed by vulgar and offensive criticisms of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's soda size restrictions and perceived hypocrisy regarding other unhealthy foods.  They discussed wrestling, specifically Bubba Ray Dudley, including a story about one host getting carsick in Dudley's limo, and further criticized Bloomberg's bike lane and traffic policies, along with a billionaire's donation to Central Park.

A significant portion was dedicated to "Jocktober," mocking other radio programs, particularly a $5,000 fugitive contest on Vermont's 97.5 Eagle Country.  The hosts played listener-submitted content from the station's Facebook page, filled with racist and sexually explicit material, expressing disgust and disbelief.  The upcoming appearance of the RZA was also mentioned, alongside complaints about microphone issues.

The next segment began with a discussion of poorly made t-shirts sent by Magic 93.1, a radio station that had previously featured the show in a news report. This led back to mocking the Eagle Country fugitive segment, playing phone calls from the fugitive and highlighting increasingly ridiculous clues.  The hosts noted the deletion of Facebook pages by several radio stations involved, including Magic 93.1 and Eagle 97.5, and discussed Facebook's stock price and fake Jocktober profiles. This transitioned into anecdotes about Jim Chandler, an old colleague, and other inside jokes from their early careers.  A listenerâ€™s story about his much older girlfriend was discussed with crude and sexually suggestive humor, followed by humorous interactions with an employee named Iraq, who was oblivious to the ongoing segments, and stories from his work at Disney. The fugitive's identity was eventually revealed via photos on the station's website. A bonus track from Scott and Todd was interrupted, followed by a promotion for Jim Norton's live show.

Pat Cooper's guest appearance dominated a large portion of the show, focusing on his long-standing feud with Howard Stern.  He recounted numerous instances of insults and confrontations using highly offensive language, detailing alleged bullying, spying, and unfair treatment of interns by Stern.  Cooper also criticized other celebrities, including Joy Behar, Chevy Chase, and Donald Trump, often with similarly harsh and offensive language.  He discussed Stern's wealth and perceived lack of generosity and digressed into critiques of *America's Got Talent*, personal anecdotes, and animal sexuality in National Geographic.  The segment concluded with promotion of Cooper's own comedy show.

The final segment featured Cooper's continued unpredictable commentary, directed at various targets including Jim Norton, Joe DiMaggio, and A-Rod. The hosts reacted with amusement and bewilderment. The show concluded with Sam Roberts interviewing Sal's mother, who expressed her intense fandom for Barry Manilow in explicit detail, even describing her masturbatory fantasies involving him.  The segment concluded with Sal's mother's live on-air masturbation.  The show ended with the announcement of D.L. Hughley's book, "I Want You to Shut the Fuck Up," being given away as a prize.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started. 
[00:04:00]  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O and A every day.  That's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed, and conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I wouldn't eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  Why doesn't it smell too bad?  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover.  The transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:00]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Oh, you want to hear the greatest of all?  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  Whip-em-out Wednesday. 
[00:05:30]  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  Show your tits.  Show your tits.  I don't remember that.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Still see an occasional schticker around?  A schticker?  That used to be huge, huh?  Yeah, it used to be.  I do recall.  Do we still mail out WoW stickers?  We do?  Yeah.  Wow.  Do we promote it?  No. 
[00:06:00]  What about war bonds?  Do we mail those out?  Anything like that?  I don't know.  I think the WoW thing is timeless.  Nixon's the one?  Bumper stickers?  Any of those?  I don't know.  Whip inflation now?  Remember the win buttons?  Do we send those out?  I think WoW's timeless.  I heard a call on the FU line where a guy was all fucking annoyed because he was sort  of negotiating with some broad in a parking lot, I think it was.  Oh, Jesus.  And I think his call was, look, if you're not going to show your tits, I'm out of here. 
[00:06:30]  Great.  So it started as WoW.  Now it's just called sexual harassment.  Oh, he was annoyed.  He wasn't, like, forcing it.  But he felt like he was waiting around a little too long and he needed a decision by this woman.  Yeah, make up your mind.  Because supposedly she had the WoW sticker or he...  Wait, no.  He had the WoW...  Do you have the call?  Because now I've got to hear it again.  Nothing to be chuggled.  He had the WoW sticker.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then a girl acknowledged the WoW sticker and he's like, yeah, well, you know what that  means if you're acknowledging it. 
[00:07:00]  And then it's something like, you know, I'm not going to wait around here anymore.  Nothing sexier to a girl than a guy going, shit or get off the pot.  Yeah, exactly.  Show your tits.  Come on, show your fucking tits.  You got that?  It's in the string.  Yeah, just find it.  Whatever.  It's all good.  It's all good.  I guess Mel Karmazin is leaving our company here at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  You're kidding.  Stepping down in February.  What happened?  Liberty Media is about to take over the whole operation here. 
[00:07:30]  I hear it's Black History Month.  He's boycotting it by stepping down.  Oh, man.  He said he won't have another month of that celebrated at this company.  Well, do we blame him?  We got Liberty's clip of his announcement.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Oh, Jesus.  Everyone's asking for our opinion on that.  I know.  I don't care.  I go, we. 
[00:08:00]  I and we.  We all go back with Mel Karmazin.  Way back, as they say.  But I don't know.  He became a guy that just took care of one guy.  So I don't know.  I don't know how to feel it.  I wish him the best.  I don't know.  It's the unknown.  The unknown coming in.  He did right by us, and he also fucked us pretty hard in our careers.  Over the years.  We had a topsy-turvy relationship.  On again, off again, what'd you call it?  Yeah, we were.  Topsy-turvy?  We were on top of the radio world, and then, you know, in the end, he made the call to fire 
[00:08:30]  us and put us on the beach for two and a half years.  And then, all of a sudden, he hires us again.  It's very strange.  Yeah.  Very strange.  A wacky business.  Quite frankly, I only saw him once in the last two years.  Yeah.  That's not the Mel I remember.  No, I don't think he had the ability over the past few years to be hands-on around here.  You don't think so?  No, I think a lot of it had to do with the board that's here, and I think they limited  his power, I guess you could say. 
[00:09:00]  But, you know, it's what it is.  They know more than I, as far as what this company needs as a business.  I'm all for another company taking over.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Throw some fucking fresh blood in here and see what happens.  Fresh blood.  It could be the worst thing.  I mean, when a new company takes over, especially in this business, it's either, well, this is  going to sound dumb, obviously, but it's either really good or really bad.  But I'm willing to take the chance at this point.  Rolled, rolled and bones, right? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, because we need new carpets.  We need a new paint job around here.  Remember when this place was all shiny?  People need raises around here.  It's dingy now.  It's getting a little fucking weathered.  I don't know how I feel because it's like, Mel has never, like, he's never been mean to  me, but, like, he's never been nice either.  Not to your face.  No, no, but I mean, like, I'll say hi, and he would kind of ignore me, or he would acknowledge  it if he saw me, but he never went out of his way to say hello to me once, but he hired  me.  Like, you know what I mean?  It's like, eh.  He's always been that type of guy.  He's not really personable. 
[00:10:00]  Last time I saw him, he was getting in the elevator.  He goes, hey, you still work here?  I'm like, oh, gee, thanks.  I saw him at the McCartney show, I think, was the last time I really saw him.  And?  Yeah, I talked to him in the aisle there.  What did you say, though?  I said, hey.  Let's break down the conversation.  Hey, Mel.  It was like, hey, how are you doing?  He shook my hand, and then I said, um, nothing, and walked away.  See, that's.  Good show.  Yeah, man.  Big night.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of those.  One of those in-depth conversations. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, horrible.  I don't see Liberty swooping in and going, you guys, you know what you need?  New rugs.  Right.  True.  I get scared of companies.  You think this bean situation?  No, I don't know if it's that bad, but I mean, I always get scared when companies come  in.  It happened at fucking, at the Tonight Show.  I hear.  But they can't strip this.  Comcast took over.  They can't strip this down anymore, can they?  Oh, you watch.  They have stripped down this place.  You watch.  People haven't had raises.  The very talented ones have left a long time ago because they couldn't deal with this shit  anymore.  That's why we're still here. 
[00:11:00]  Well.  The very talented ones left.  Exactly.  We're the silt at the bottom of the bucket.  Yes.  You know, I mean, to be honest, we kind of, you know, and it pisses off a lot of people,  but we kind of made the cut.  Very few shows made the cut and everyone else has to suffer.  That's a fact.  Personal interest in seeing you suffer.  We made the cut.  Yeah.  That's, that's the, that's what happened there.  I'm just hoping the new company doesn't deal with, you know, all the bullshit from,  you know, oh, oh, down the hall. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're going to do over there.  We'll see enough of that.  Should be interesting.  I'm hoping a new guy has fucking very good glasses so he could see clearly.  Should be interesting.  I'm hoping to maybe a sit down with a few of the players.  Oh yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Sit down with a few of the big players coming in and, you know, have a little meeting,  let them know who we are and what we do, where we stand.  Yeah.  Uh, our, our dedication to, uh, the company and, uh, uh, the fact that I'm, uh, what they 
[00:12:00]  call a company man.  Yeah.  Sure.  You're that guy now.  Sure.  I'll put my ass kissing fucking, my ass kissing suit on, kiss a little ass.  So, you know, I want to, I want to thank Mel for hiring us, um, firing us, hiring us again.  Indeed.  And, uh, I wish him all the best.  He's still young.  He's like 69.  He'll, he's, he's not going to retire.  Is he 69?  Yeah.  He'll, I thought he was really younger than I did. 
[00:12:30]  He'll move on.  He'll move on to something else.  He's not going to fucking sit on.  He's one of these guys.  He can't sit out.  He's going to.  No.  He'll turn around and do something almost immediately.  I would assume.  Absolutely.  If that guy's pulling in $300,000 a year, he has no need to work.  Oh, you know, he was, he, uh, said in an article recently that he's one of the most  underpaid, uh, executives in history.  And then John Malone kind of said that's laughable.  So thus then why there was a problem.  Oh, right, right, right.  Oh boy.  There was people banging heads. 
[00:13:00]  They're having that, uh, in the press discussion where one guy says something and then somebody  responds to it in the press.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know his exact quote, but he thought it was laughable.  What Mel said about being underpaid.  My boy.  Well, I would love to be underpaid like that.  That's all I would need in life.  He's here until February though, right?  Yes.  That's, uh, which means he can still fucking put our heads in a fucking face.  I don't think we're saying anything bad.  Everyone's talking about what you're going to do. 
[00:13:30]  We're going to both.  So we got that going, which is not, oh, stock dropped a little bit yesterday.  I wonder if it's a buying opportunity.  Well, uh, Apple's a dollar 80 a share again.  Jesus.  The market took a giant shit yesterday.  Giant shit.  Why?  Because of, uh, Donald Trump's announcement today?  Yeah, that must be it.  What has Donald Trump got?  Donald Trump.  I hear divorce papers.  Apparently.  Rumor has it.  The Obamas were going to get a divorce back in what?  2000 was it?  2000.  2001.  How does everyone know before the announcement? 
[00:14:00]  Because somebody that, uh, the Donald was talking with, I gather, spilled the beans.  Really?  Allegedly.  I'm not sure if this is even his announcement, but people are saying this is probably his  announcement, is that the Obamas, the Obamas, perhaps, were, um, drawing up the old divorce  papers.  And then what happened?  I don't know.  Maybe they got an inkling of, uh, political, uh, future and what that would mean and decided, 
[00:14:30]  you know, hold off.  You can't have a divorced guy as a president, right?  How cool would that be, though?  We would actually.  Where he just has dates for all these functions?  All, I mean, believe me, there's plenty of presidents that are technically and were technically  divorced without the paperwork.  Clinton.  Fucking Clinton is a prime example.  FDR.  Of a guy.  FDR, really?  Yeah.  Eleanor Roosevelt, right?  Eleanor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was a looker, that one.  No, she was not attractive.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Oh, I thought she was.  They were both, uh, you know, I think that she was, wasn't she a lesbian or something? 
[00:15:00]  Ah, they, uh, they have said.  John and, uh, Jackie.  They had their inklings.  John and Jackie.  What are you talking about?  Oh, the fucking that was going on.  That's royalty.  Royalty.  You can't mess with Camelot.  I was watching, um.  But, uh, just really fast, the Donald Trump thing with the divorce papers, and I, you  know, most people would say, what's the big deal?  You know, couples have their issues all the time, but, but the, the wow today is going  to be why they were getting divorced.  Right.  Oh.  Supposedly.  What's in the paperwork? 
[00:15:30]  What's in the papers?  What's it?  What is it?  There's something in the papers.  Is it just irreconcilable differences, or is it adultery?  Is it, uh.  People are saying there's a wow in the papers.  Cruel and inhuman, uh, uh, punishment, uh, whatever.  Getting blown in a limo by a man.  Oh, in carny.  Oh, in gurney.  Gurney, right.  Gurney.  Oh, Jesus.  That's right.  Well, there, there, there's been those rumors over the years.  What is it?  What is it?  Well, Donald's going to tell us, because, you know.  The Donald will inject himself into this. 
[00:16:00]  When he's ready.  When Donald Trump's ready.  Yeah.  When Donald J.  Trump is ready, he'll let the world know.  He'll let the world know.  When is he going to be ready?  Do we know yet?  Yeah.  What the fuck time is this?  And is it going to be on our watch?  And supposedly it's on his Facebook.  What?  He's trying to get some likes today.  He was on, well, on Fox News, he was plugging his Twitter hard.  He loves Twitter.  He loves the Twitter.  I think he loves Twitter more than us, and that's kind of crazy.  He says, uh, probably today.  Probably.  He said, it will probably be Wednesday on, and he said on Fox News anyway, that he would 
[00:16:30]  do it on his Twitter.  Ah.  I heard he was doing it on his Facebook.  Oh.  So he's changed to Twitter now.  Maybe he's got the next one.  He realizes Twitter is better than Facebook.  Oh, of course it is.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, who knows?  Who knows?  Well, it wouldn't surprise me, because Barack Obama has not released quite a few things  that people wanted to get a look at.  Any of the evidence that he went to these colleges that he said he went to, any of his  transcripts from these colleges are just sealed up. 
[00:17:00]  But how can't you get that paperwork?  I don't know.  You'd think you could, but you can't.  How?  No one has it.  How?  And everyone is speculating because the incendiary content of these things, his socialist writings  and anti-American shit would be all over these papers.  Well, we're obviously a socialist country because he's been in office for the last four years,  so it's gotten crazy.  I have to wait online for bread every day now.  Exactly. 
[00:17:30]  Exactly.  And goulash.  Exactly.  I give my family bread and goulash every day because President Obama's been in office  four years.  Yes.  Yes.  There's crazy times now.  Crazy times.  You look at nighttime photographs of the country and you see Mexico and Canada is all lit up  and the United States is pitch black at night because we can't even keep the lights on.  No, it's because we have to get up for work in the morning.  In Mexico, they're all down there laughing, having chalupas.  The guy who doesn't know what he's talking about.  He's making up reasons as I go along.  Well, here's Donald Trump teasing his big Obama announcement. 
[00:18:00]  All right.  This is a big day for the Donald.  Hey, before you go, we have sources, Donald, who tell us that you have a large, bordering  on gigantic announcement this week.  I do.  What is it?  It's going to be announced probably on Wednesday, but I have something very, very big concerning  the president of the United States.  Give us a hint.  I won't do that.  Just a little hint.  I won't do that, but I will talk to you probably on Wednesday.  I kind of like his fucking... 
[00:18:30]  He makes...  I kind of like his asshole attitude.  He is such an ass.  I kind of like him in a weird way.  He's such a pompous dick.  Just a little hint.  I won't do that, but I will talk to you probably on Wednesday.  That's probably what I'm going to announce.  That's what I'm going to announce.  Uh-oh.  And I announced it on at Real Donald Trump, the Twitter, and I will be announcing it sometime  probably Wednesday, and it's going to be very big.  Sounds like a radio promotion, right? 
[00:19:00]  He's going to announce it while he's on a sign on the highway, standing up there until  he's not going to come down, until enough money's been raised.  Sometime in the 7 o'clock hour.  Yeah.  I am the fugitive with a special announcement concerning Obama.  A dog came up to me.  I would say, a dog came up to...  Whatever happened to that guy?  Is he still around?  The Bobes?  Yeah.  He didn't want to do the show anymore.  He said hi.  He said hi.  Yeah.  He sent a picture or something of Uncle Paul's restaurant or something. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  He thought it was hilariously funny and said, why can't he be on the show?  Oh, very good.  And it's going to be very big.  Very big.  I know one thing.  You will cover it in a very big fashion.  Well, will it have changed the election?  Possibly.  Wow.  Is it personal, or does it have to do with how he governs?  It's all in one, everything.  It's very big.  Okay, so...  Bigger than anybody would know. 
[00:20:00]  Get the announcement at Real Donald Trump on Twitter, and maybe we'll have him back on  Wednesday.  Oh, my God.  This is the world.  We will have him back on Wednesday.  That is possible.  Just the world we live in.  Give up my sports cash.  All right.  This is how a possible presidential candidate handles things.  Oh, that's right.  This is the world we live in.  This is the world we live in.  I forgot about that.  That's how a guy who wants to run the free world acts, wait till Wednesday on my Twitter  and hear what I have to say.  On my Twitter.  What's Kimmel got?  I don't know. 
[00:20:30]  That's hot.  It looks funny, though.  I know.  Kimmel's hilarious.  That's an old video.  Was it?  Why were they showing it?  The two kids, like, the two 18-month-olds having a conversation?  On the elevator?  You've never seen that?  No.  It has literally, like, 200 million views or something.  Holy shit.  They're chatting?  Yeah, it's like...  Is it cute?  It looks like it.  Is it adorable?  Oh, I think so.  Let me see.  Then again, I sort of like kids.  Oh, no, no.  I think it's adorable.  I just don't want them running around my house.  Yeah.  But, you know, videos, stuff, Charlie, Charlie bit my finger? 
[00:21:00]  Come on, that's hilarious.  You have a lot of kids that run around your house.  All the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the Donald Trump thing.  What time, though?  Seriously.  Yeah.  It's going to make us wait all day.  No time or anything.  It's not going to be on our show.  Why?  Why?  Why?  What do you think it is, Ant?  I think it's this fucking divorce thing.  But I think you got a point here as far as not just the divorce, but the reason.  Well...  That would be big.  Supposedly it's something to do with the actual divorce. 
[00:21:30]  What's in the papers?  That's probably alleging an affair.  It's...  I guarantee it's a fucking non-issue.  Well, it's coming from a guy that's been divorced a few times, huh?  Yeah, but that may be...  Yeah, but that may be...  That may be it.  Filed for divorce over allegations of infidelity.  Give us a fuck.  Mr. President, you're fired.  Yeah.  You're fired.  We should look at him in November and say, you're fired.  You're fired.  I can't do it as well as you, but I love it. 
[00:22:00]  I can't do it either, but it's fun just to capture the dickishness of us.  All you have to do is purse your lips and you can have fun trying to do it.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  Ooh.  Get that on a shirt.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Jeez Louise.  We got the World Series starting tonight.  What?  Giants-Tigers.  Baseball.  Who's fucking paying attention to that shit?  Well, that's your sport.  What?  That's your sport.  You gotta go Tigers.  Not now.  Gotta go Tigers.  What, the D?  I'm not supporting Detroit in any way, shape, or form. 
[00:22:30]  You have to.  Fuck the D.  They need something.  They need something nice up there.  Yeah, a fucking carpet bombing.  San Francisco's good.  They're all set up nice with their city.  Don't misbehave if they win in Detroit.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't know.  Burn some more shit down that doesn't need to be standing anymore.  It's fine.  Oh, my God.  And then you got Carlton Fisk driving into a cornfield.  He rules.  What happened?  You didn't hear this story yet?  No.  Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. 
[00:23:00]  Little DUI.  And they arrested him in a cornfield.  Oh, boy.  That's where the car ended up.  Yeah.  In a cornfield.  Oh, look at the mugshot.  That doesn't look good.  He looks a little confused.  What do you got on this?  Anything else, Sam?  That's pretty much it?  Yeah.  He walked out and drove into a cornfield.  Cornfield, no field of dreams for Carlton Fisk.  That's the headline.  Oh, that's kind of clever.  Get it?  Yeah, it's clever.  Because there was that baseball moment.  Right.  And I think that was in a cornfield.  So it's kind of cool.  To be a good thing he's not a pedophile. 
[00:23:30]  They would have said, no children of the corn.  Ah.  There was a, he passed out in the truck.  Like, they just found him passed out in his truck in the middle of a cornfield.  The truck had a flat tire and there was an open bottle of vodka in it.  What happens to these guys?  Whoops.  I think it's tough to, like, retire at an early age like that.  Yeah.  Because then what else do you do?  You can only tell your baseball stories long enough and go to these, you know, car dealerships.  And I'm sure he was doing a little more than that.  But I don't know, man. 
[00:24:00]  It's got to be tough for an athlete.  Yeah, you just got to fucking, you know, drive around and drink.  Pretty much at 40, you're completely.  That's about it.  But at 40, you're completely done with your whole career.  Now go fucking do whatever you want to do.  I think we started at 40.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You can start a video game company and go bankrupt.  Who did that?  Kurt Schilling.  Schilling.  Oh, good old Kurt.  Oh, my God, yeah.  They were talking about him selling his bloody sock.  You're right.  I don't know.  That's fucking.  But how is he broke?  He fucking put all his money into video games. 
[00:24:30]  He fucking put all his money into video games and took so many loans out and everything.  He's just fucked.  Is he really broke, bro?  Totally broke, bro.  Lost all his baseball earnings.  Every penny gone.  Come on.  He's got something left.  Nope.  They really were.  Not only not money, he's in such debt.  Really?  It's insane.  They were saying he's going to, like Anthony said, sell his bloody sock.  Sell the bloody sock.  And then what do you get for that?  A few thousand?  I bet he gets...  30,000 maybe?  No, more than that.  No way.  I would get a bunch of white Hanes. 
[00:25:00]  I don't think so.  A bunch of white Hanes.  You put them on and a pellet gun.  And then you just shoot yourself in the ankle.  Take that one off.  Shoot yourself in the ankle.  And just make a bunch of bloody fucking socks.  You know who's really hurting, too?  Our old pal from Boston.  Who's that?  I didn't realize we were going to talk about this.  Albert DeSala?  Oh, oh.  Antoine Walker?  Antoine Walker is...  Sorry, I didn't hear you.  I'm sure it was funny.  No, you said Albert DeSala.  Oh, sorry.  I enjoyed this one.  I was too busy trying to come up with this stupid name.  Yeah, Antoine Walker is hurting bad. 
[00:25:30]  There was a time that guy had money to burn.  Who is he?  Yeah, he was a Boston Celtic.  He was well on his way to becoming one of the better players in the league.  Made the All-Star game and all that.  And then, man, it just went bad for the guy.  He was playing in the D League and the NBA, trying to get his career going again.  Making shit money in a shitty city somewhere.  And they said he is broke as well in a bad way.  I think his problems... 
[00:26:00]  He might have had a gambling thing, right?  All right.  That's different than trying to open or get your video game company off the ground.  I say our pal because we had inside info on the guy.  He had a lot of hanger-ons that he was taking care of.  Love chicks.  That shit.  You can't do the MC Hammer.  You can't take care of everybody around you like that, assuming the money's going to always be there.  Yeah.  There's two bloody socks.  There's one in Cooperstown, and he's got one.  So you know he's on the phone.  Both ankles were bleeding? 
[00:26:30]  No, he was in two games.  Oh, come now.  No one remembers that.  Yeah, man.  They remember the one where they zoomed in on it.  As a matter of fact...  Wait, maybe there's...  No, he must be trying to get...  The two are the one in Cooperstown and the one he left in the Yankees' garbage can in their dugout.  Wow, he threw it out?  Yeah, but he threw it on top so the Yankees could see it.  Did someone get it?  Someone's got to have it.  If they have it, Kurt needs it back.  You talked to my old pal, Kurt Schilling? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, no, none of the listeners of the Sam Roberts show bought his game.  He blew me off years ago.  Did him nothing.  But we kind of started together.  Kurt was a big EverQuest guy.  He played EverQuest crazy and decided he was going to make the next EverQuest.  So he dumped all this money into it and people were like, no, play EverQuest or fucking then World of Warcraft.  But can't you get that money back if it doesn't...  Oh, boy.  No.  Oh, boy.  No, he...  He needs some plat and some gold and some copper and silver.  His game looked dumb. 
[00:27:30]  The sword's going all witch-away and swinging and who the fuck wants that?  I didn't see it.  Witch-away?  Jay Leno barely escapes a motorcycle crash?  It's from a year ago.  Oh, what are all these fucking videos from way back, Machine?  What do you mean barely?  I'm commenting on videos that were fucking done years ago.  But what do you mean barely?  He didn't even know that that happened.  He was ahead of the crash.  Look.  There's Jay, right?  He has no idea that just happened behind him.  Well, it's wonderful.  I'm just driving and all hell is breaking loose behind him. 
[00:28:00]  Nah, it's close enough, though.  Sure.  Oh, a little sigh of relief for myself, that was.  Oh, jeez.  So, Kurt Schilling's in trouble.  Carlton Fisk is in a cornfield.  Carlton Fisk is fucking...  We had a situation outside of New York City yesterday that is driving everyone nuts.  Some fucking animal killed two people.  You know, I was thinking today as I was preparing for the show, you know, social issues, like, 
[00:28:30]  you could argue with people.  The abortion thing, this and that, sure, we'll discuss it.  But that's one where I don't even see the other side.  When some fucking guy is just minding his own business and he's pulled out of his fucking car...  Shot in the head.  And shot in the head and left dead on a highway.  Yeah, you explain to me why we shouldn't have the death penalty.  Kill the guy.  And in this case, that wouldn't even be a death penalty case, which blows me away. 
[00:29:00]  And this was a guy, the guy who did it was on parole after serving time for...  Well, yeah, that's...  Attempted murder.  That's the big fucking ticket item that I was talking about.  For the people that don't know, we lost a cop and just a regular Joe driving probably home from work or what have you.  Second NASA kind of cop to be killed in a week.  In about a week, yeah.  It's just crazy.  I guess this guy was involved in an accident.  The suspect, 33-year-old Daryl Fuller, yo. 
[00:29:30]  And he was involved in an accident.  He then was pulled over by a cop, Officer Lopez, a 29-year-old Nassau County police officer.  And just pulled a gun out and shot him right in the chest as he walked up to the car.  Unfortunately, he wasn't wearing his vest.  I don't know why a cop would not wear a vest in this day and age, but I'm not going to blame the victim.  And then the guy drove off, hijacked or carjacked this other guy, this Jamaican father and brand-new grandfather, working guy, drags him out of his car, shoots him in the head, and takes his fucking car. 
[00:30:00]  He was found a few hours later with self-inflicted gunshot wounds, but he wasn't dead.  Where did he shoot himself?  Probably in the leg.  Fucking pussy.  Oh, is he alive?  I thought he was dead.  No, he's still alive.  He's still alive.  He didn't finish the fucking job for everybody.  But here's what gets me infuriated and started me on a tear on Twitter last night that lasted hours. 
[00:30:30]  And again, I was called racist, of course.  The fact that the laws are there already.  The laws are there.  This guy obviously didn't have a legal gun.  He was getting a gun anyway.  Just stop.  No laws are going to keep this fucker from getting a gun.  And he's a criminal.  And the fact that he was paroled after an attempted murder rap, this guy was obviously not one of these people that you can look at and decide, all right, he could be paroled. 
[00:31:00]  He won't be a danger to society.  The reason that this guy was out of prison is beyond me.  It's fucking beyond me.  And those are the things that need to be addressed, not the fact that I need more legislation against me for guns and legal gun owners need more legislation.  And we've got to get guns off the street and guns, guns, guns, guns.  It's fucking savage animals like this fucking cock that goes around and just kills people without any thought process, without any fucking guilt, no respect for human life, nothing. 
[00:31:30]  And this fuck should be put to death.  Yeah, who decided that he should be let out of prison?  Who?  And paroled.  Who?  This guy wasn't going to turn his life around?  No, just stop.  Attempted murderer?  What are you?  I mean, that's crazy. 
[00:32:00]  I would love to know the details of why they paroled him.  Did he do five years before they paroled him?  I perused the story.  Five years ain't fucking long enough.  No, it's terrible.  This guy should fucking be.  And of course, that wasn't his first.  Look at this fucking cocksucker.  Ah!  You make it real difficult, you motherfuckers.  Boy, do you make it difficult.  Yeah, you do.  Sorry.  That, the fucking nice white 12-year-old girl gets fucking killed by two savages that 
[00:32:30]  was stealing her bicycle?  Yeah, stupid.  You cocksuckers.  What was it?  It was the neighbors, right?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Kids in the neighborhood?  One was 15, one was 17.  They wanted her BMX, and she's been missing.  And they strangled her.  And threw her in a dumpster.  Yeah, and then sold parts of her bike.  Spin that around.  Yeah.  Two white fucking boys killing a black girl.  You'd fucking see marches and outrage and all kinds of shit.  There's such a problem.  Such a problem that no one wants to fucking address. 
[00:33:00]  No one wants to talk about.  The big, deep, dark secret.  Like the retard you keep in the basement.  Right?  I do.  But, no, it's just, it's infuriating.  Infuriating.  No one wants to address this.  The second you do, they can't fucking type racist in fast enough.  I know.  Ah!  Hate it.  You're right?  Yeah.  I get all fucking...  No, no, no.  No one on his podcast yesterday had Alan Combs.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  I thought of you guys.  I didn't see him, but I heard it was kind of a heated debate, but race came up.  With Alan Combs?  Yeah, well, he's ultra, ultra left.  No, I know that, but he's not.  He's so far left.  But he's a pushover.  But I heard one of the lines that he used was, like, they were talking about race and  something, and he said to no one, he goes, like, what do you think, black people are  lazy?  Like, but that wasn't what no one was saying.  Oh, God.  And you throw that out.  Like, you can't address race with some guilty white guys without them thinking that you're  being a fucking Klansman.  It's frustrating.  It's the easiest way for the left to completely derail an intelligent conversation about race and 
[00:34:00]  crime and whatnot is just to call someone a racist, even hint that you're being racist,  and it totally derails the conversation.  We're a bully.  You're a racist bully.  It makes the person all of a sudden get defensive about being called a racist, so the actual subject  matter never gets discussed.  That conversation's done.  That's why I fucking don't even care. 
[00:34:30]  Call me whatever the fuck you want.  Look at that.  Look, look, look.  Ah, Jesus Christ.  Look at that little white girl killed by two animals.  Ugh!  Look at this.  For a stupid bike.  Yeah.  For a bike.  I will say this, though.  Their mother turned them in.  Oh, good.  Well, she saw some weird Facebook posting.  Good.  How dumb are people?  Do you not know that Facebook is public?  Pretty dumb.  What do people do?  Well, the one kid updated his Facebook. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  His status was murdered.  I just, I'm disgusted with the whole thing.  I was trying to get a little conversation about it last night on the Twitter.  A little conversation.  Nice little conversation.  A few answers.  A few answers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It goes south so quickly.  Just some answers.  I put the questions out there, and I want the people to maybe give a few answers.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I got some answers.  I'm apparently a racist.  And it seems that some people can't handle the four hours of bullshit that I spew on the air. 
[00:35:30]  Never mind the shit I spew on Twitter.  Was that a tweet you got from Jim Norton and Opie Radio?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Chill out a little bit.  Oh, God.  Well, that's another thing I got with people going, Anthony, you live in a nice neighborhood.  Why don't you relax and just enjoy yourself?  This doesn't even involve you.  And then I'm like, doesn't it involve me?  A police officer from the county I live in that is paid by my tax dollars to serve and protect me and my neighbors and whatnot was killed yesterday by one of these fuck animals. 
[00:36:00]  And it doesn't involve me?  I'm not allowed to discuss it on Twitter or I should relax?  No.  Why did the guy kill?  Because he's a fucking animal with no sense of...  We haven't found out any reasoning yet. 
[00:36:30]  He wanted to get away.  And he had no qualms about killing people doing it.  Maybe a stolen car or an illegal gun or whatever it was.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Whatever it was.  Drugs in the car.  I'm sure.  Something.  Yeah.  I'm sure if the cop questioned him, he was going back to prison.  Didn't want to go back to prison.  And like a lot of these fucks, they just have no concept that the person on the other end of their gun is a living being with family, friends, people that love them, people that they love. 
[00:37:00]  Because they have no concept of what that's like, being an animal.  How do you yank that guy out of the car?  Shoot.  Right in the head.  You know that he's not armed.  Right.  He's just a civilian.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because that guy, he could have easily got his car.  Right.  And some attorney will fucking try to twist it that he was just scared.  He was scared and running from the racist system that was after him. 
[00:37:30]  That's the fucking angle they'll use.  These cocksuckers.  That's really sad.  There's got to be a fucking answer to this.  And the answer isn't legislating against law-abiding citizens.  It's not guns.  It's not.  There's a fucking problem that's bubbling below the surface that no one wants to look at or address.  They kick it under the carpet.  They fucking...  They close the door on it.  But no one wants to actually address the real fucking problem. 
[00:38:00]  And what's going on with the New Jersey girl?  With those guys?  New Jersey girl!  She was fucking killed.  No, I know that.  But I mean, what's going on with those two kids?  Yeah, they were arrested.  But, you know, 15 and 17.  I'm sure there'll be some liberal cunt-faced judge and lawyer and social workers that'll say,  You know, why sacrifice these two young lives in prison and just make them worse when, really, we need to just educate them.  And then within a couple of years, they'll be out in public, killing, raping, maiming, and doing what they do. 
[00:38:30]  Shut it!  I would say that the 17-year-old will be tried as an adult.  15-year-old, I don't know.  I guess it depends on what part one had.  Well, I mean, maybe they will.  Yeah, of course.  The 17-year-old, you almost know will be.  Just killed.  Killed.  Had it.  It didn't surprise me when I heard what the crime was.  When I heard it was killed for a bike, I'm like, Eh, that's not really a white teenager crime.  No, no. 
[00:39:00]  No, if it was rape and murder.  That could have been anybody.  That could be a white person.  That could be anybody.  Oh, that's for sure.  Whitey loves rapey murder.  I tuned into local news yesterday because of this cop shooting, and it was one story  after another.  It just got worse and worse.  Didn't it?  Then I had a bunch of people over my house yesterday, like, Hey, let's throw on Spongebob  for the kid.  I don't want to hear this shit.  I mean, a cop thing, obviously we do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And this situation, obviously. 
[00:39:30]  But then there was someone else that was murdered, and the kid was kidnapped, and it's just like,  what the fuck?  It's just awfulness.  They just search out the worst stories every day, right, for the news?  Yeah.  Dog, do you hear about that?  Speaking of that, like, put on Spongebob, that in, I guess, the UK, they were supposed  to be playing Madagascar 3 in the movie theater full of kids, and they put on Paranormal 4,  Paranormal Activity 4, which they say started with the clip from an earlier Paranormal Activity  movie, right away, where a bloody woman's body gets thrown at the camera, and the kids 
[00:40:00]  were crying and screaming, parents trying to calm their fucking hysterical children.  That's hilarious.  Hilarious.  I took my kid to a pumpkin patch, and they had the big, tall scarecrows.  Yeah.  You know, they were about 8 to 10 feet high, and I was fucking with them a little bit,  trying to, you know, get a little, get them scared a little bit.  Yeah.  Then on the way home, in the dark, he was convinced that giant robots were chasing the  car.  And we couldn't figure it out at first.  I'm like, oh, he saw the scarecrows. 
[00:40:30]  He thinks those are giant robots, and now he thinks they're chasing the car.  Why would he think they're chasing the car?  Because he's too.  Was he upset?  No one changed.  Was he upset by it?  He wanted me to make sure the giant robots weren't chasing the car anymore.  How did you assure him that they weren't?  Well, after laughing openly.  Of course.  Then we said, don't worry, there's no giant fucking robots.  Did you tell him they don't have feet?  They're just straw things meant.  Explain the crops to him.  Right.  And say that the crows come and destroy the crops, and therefore these things frighten 
[00:41:00]  them away.  Just their brains, what they come up with.  I thought it was just a silly little scarecrow in a pumpkin field.  That turns out to be a giant robot that's chasing them now.  Yeah.  Fast forward 20 years, he's in therapy, and it comes out, and that's what it is.  Yeah, right.  That's the problem all along.  The day Dad brought him to the pumpkin patch to have a little Halloween fawn.  Yes.  So do you know what it is?  That fucking thing had a hat on!  A giant robot chasing the car. 
[00:41:30]  Like, wow.  I thought I had a smart one.  Giant robot.  Well, I mean, technically, it's not a bad assumption.  I mean, the thing's not moving.  No, of course.  You know?  Yeah.  Robot's probably a smarter way to go with it than to think that it's alive.  That's true.  Than a monster.  At least he acknowledges it's not a living being.  Right.  Yeah.  I went on a tractor ride and all that, and I guess business is way down at this pumpkin  patch, so they're turning the whole place into a huge Wegmans. 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Kind of sad.  That is sad.  Farmers can't hold out anymore.  Nah.  What the fuck?  Farming.  What is it?  1850?  Well, it's sad, because, you know...  Just listen to me.  I'm bashing farms for no reason.  I used to, like, driving out east on Long Island, but those farmers couldn't hang out anymore,  so they're, like, selling their land and track housing in and all that shit, because, you  know, it's too lucrative for them.  Hey, is there a haunted house in New York?  I want to go.  Oh, they're all over the place.  I want to go to a good one.  Oh, my God.  Sam, where's a good haunted house? 
[00:42:30]  It's up in Ulster.  Oh!  The problem is, the lines are, like, fucking two, three hour way.  Are they really?  No.  For some of these places.  Oh, nerds.  The one, if you go at the right time.  Yeah, if you go, like, 11 a.m. in the morning when it's nice and sunny.  I want to go at night.  They'll get you right in.  Yeah, you can go at night.  Where's the one where the guy would come, he came in a few times?  That's Ulster County.  How far is that?  Six, nine hours?  No, it's not quite that far.  It's, like, from here.  An hour.  Obviously!  Probably about two hours. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, it's two hours?  Jimmy ain't going two hours to a haunted house?  Well, it's maybe a little less than that, but it's probably about an hour from me and Westchester.  Who would I go with?  You can come with me and Jess.  I'll go, too.  She just doesn't dislike you at all.  She does.  Well, she dislikes you.  I do want to go, though.  I'll go, yeah.  I want to go.  But I want to bring, I don't have any lady friends to bring.  I like to bring a girl who goes, ooh, and cuddles against me, and then I grab her tits and go, monsters.  Giant robots are chasing us. 
[00:43:30]  The mother of the kids who killed the girl, she was trying to get the reward money?  Is that true?  And that's why she turned her own kid in?  Oh, Jesus.  Who knows?  I wouldn't be surprised.  It doesn't seem like she was much of a mother.  I don't know for sure, but I can guarantee you this much.  My kid's not going to fucking murder somebody over a bike.  Because guess what?  Parenting is a lot of work, and I know I'm going to have my own special issues with my kids, but guess what? 
[00:44:00]  I guarantee that my kid's not going to fucking chase down some little girl on a bike and murder her.  I can guarantee the world that.  They lured her into their house.  Because I realize parenting is a lot of fucking work, and it's hard.  Yeah.  I can guarantee that.  Other things, I can't.  I don't know what kind of acting up he's going to do in his life, but I can guarantee that.  But what are you thinking when you're 17 or 15?  If you're nine, that's one thing.  But how do you choke somebody to death? 
[00:44:30]  How do you think you're getting away with that?  My point is, someone in their dumb little lives saw the signs and did nothing about it.  There's savagery going on.  There's signs that are right there in front of your fucking face.  I saw the swings.  And as a parent, or whoever the fuck was raising those two kids, that's your responsibility.  Look out for the signs and then try to figure out what you can do.  There's such a problem with illegitimate kids, no parents in the household. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, you could sound like, you know, and then you get these people that just accuse you of being a right-wing nut when you say, like, a family structure.  Right.  No, there is a family structure.  Right.  And it does have an impact on what your kids do.  And when the mother might be there, don't even fucking, don't even imagine there's a father in the mix.  The mother might be there.  It's usually the grandmother who has no, absolutely no say on what the kid does.  Or just, here's the grandmother's job, to sit there after the kid kills someone or is killed and cry over the fucking coffin and say what a good chow he was and how he was fucking turning shit around. 
[00:45:30]  More bullshit.  Such a disproportionate number of criminals.  It just, it's infuriating, Jimmy.  I know.  It's infuriating.  Oh.  God.  You need to be cheered up.  Oh, no.  No.  No. 
[00:46:00]  Not Valley.  You know, everybody is the same.  Oh, God.  What a lump of shit that is.  We're all the same.  No, we're not.  Ever.  Let's go to Mike.  He's a retired cop.  Mikey on Long Island.  O.P.  What?  I have a mouthful of water.  Sorry for your loss there, sir.  Ah.  Yellow.  O.P.  Anthony, what's up, man?  Hey, man.  What's up, Mike?  Listen to my NYPD. 
[00:46:30]  Anthony, they're animals.  Just get a giant gas chamber and put them all in the chair at once.  Eh, there's a, you know, a guy that's had to deal with it.  What, 20 years?  20 plus.  20 plus years.  He had to deal with it.  You must have seen a lot of shit.  I think you're a good judge of what's going on out there.  You're, you know, you're the one that was kind of put out there by the people.  Hey, help us. 
[00:47:00]  Keep these fucking problems away from me.  So you get to see the scourges of society.  And, you know, but no one wants to listen to you, of course.  Because you're, you know, you'd be a horrible person if you just spoke the truth.  The truth is the new fucking thing you're not allowed to talk about.  It's amazing.  Fucking amazing.  It's a disgrace.  It really is.  All right, Mike.  If we don't get our guy in November, this country's finished.  Oh, well, we'll see.  You know what?  If Romney is elected, here's another fucking issue. 
[00:47:30]  Have you seen the amount of tweets?  And boy, what a bunch of dumb motherfuckers tweeting about the fact that they want to riot.  And then the assassination tweets about Romney that are coming in from a lot of people in the black Twitter community.  That are just saying, I'ma, and this is how a lot of them are written, I'ma assassinate that motherfucker.  And it's like fucking, the Secret Service is going crazy trying to keep tabs on the unbelievable amount of tweets like this that are out there. 
[00:48:00]  But the threats of rioting, the threats of death and destruction is amazing if Obama does not get elected.  That seems to be the mindset here.  I'm sure when Obama was elected, there were problems on the other side, though, where people...  No.  Not a rioting.  Not a rioting.  Not the rioting.  No, no.  And assassination threats?  Yeah.  Probably by very extremist groups, but not just your normal, everyday fucking blog post or tweet. 
[00:48:30]  That's the problem.  People love equating things that I point out with other things.  You know, things that, I guess, white people do.  Oh, the Catholic Church.  Oh, boy, them and their kids.  Yeah, okay.  I'll give it that.  Sure.  Oh, abortion clinic bombings.  Oh, wow.  The five of those that have happened in 20, 30 fucking years?  As opposed to the absolute racial holocaust that's going on in this country. 
[00:49:00]  Bowling for behave.  Bowling for behave.  They should just behave.  It's my follow-up, too.  Have, haave.  They should just behave.  And the follow-up never catches on.  Yes.  You know, why don't they just behave properly?  Why don't they behave properly?  Stolen bikes.  Killed through a bike.  It's not going to be. 
[00:49:30]  It's going to be a minority.  It's going to be them.  Why don't they behave properly?  It doesn't even charge.  It's the same version, sideways, kind of.  Or it could be your funky cold Medina.  It could be.  It could be the follow-up.  I think it's going to be more like my Let's Twist Again like we did last summer.  I actually like that one better.  What?  You like Let's Twist Again like we did last summer?  I do it better.  Then, come on, baby.  I like that one.  It's the same song.  Yeah.  But I like Let's Twist Again.  You just added a couple of extra words. 
[00:50:00]  Which one is this?  Come on, everybody.  Make your hands.  Is this Let's Twist Again?  Oh, you're looking good.  We have this guy on, right?  Yeah.  Sing my song.  It won't take long.  No.  We're going to do the twist, and it goes like this.  Come on, let's twist again.  Like we did last summer.  Yeah, let's twist again.  Wow, these days are long gone, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, all you had to worry about was twisting the right way.  Not twisting.  Right.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:50:30]  This sounds like an innocent time.  Yeah, doesn't it?  With the loss of the hairy pussy, we got bullets.  Oh.  Round and round.  Oh, yeah.  I like this.  This is a good one.  Yeah.  I'm going to twist in my chair.  Yes.  Twist again.  Oh.  Yay.  This sounds fun.  These are the racist remarks coming in on Peltong. 
[00:51:00]  Apparently, some people should have known their place, I guess.  Oh, what an innocent time.  It was an innocent time.  Well.  Yeah.  Well.  For some of the country.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  What are you going to do?  You know what?  Whatever.  It was a much more innocent time.  All right.  Why don't we take a little break?  Oh.  Make love.  Sure.  Where's our food? 
[00:51:30]  I don't know, but we should break, because we've got a very busy show.  Come on, baby.  We've got Pat Cooper coming in here, so we're done at nine.  We say hi, Pat Cooper, and next thing you know, it's ten o'clock.  What the fuck?  You know what?  It's about dignity.  Dignity.  I had to pee to Chris.  Play the fucking drums.  Shut the fuck up.  You play the fucking drums.  That's what we're going to hear.  Yeah.  Nine o'clock.  It's going to go nine to ten.  I play the bass. 
[00:52:00]  You play the guitar.  You play the fucking drums, and shut up.  Pat.  Anthony.  What are you talking about?  Oh.  I ran.  Hope he's over here.  He's talking.  Yeah.  I ran into him on the streets of Manhattan with my young family.  Unfortunately, not with your car.  With my young family.  Trying to pick up my wife, saying he's got a chalet in Italy.  Oh.  And he loves beating up Howard Stern.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't offer that.  He's not a fan. 
[00:52:30]  I swear I didn't offer that up.  He's not a fan.  He's like, you notice?  You notice he still plays me.  He still plays me.  Still plays me.  I was a star.  For a guy that hates me, he still plays me.  Still plays me.  Is there a Jocktober?  People wondering if there's a Jocktober today.  Yeah, there's a hidden Jocktober.  Holy shit.  The paper on the disc is upside down.  You can't even read the content.  Oh, Sam.  Sam, what's this about?  It's very mysterious.  This took two days of no Jocktober. 
[00:53:00]  Put together.  Can I even read any of this?  There's one thing I can read, but the rest I cannot.  It's folded over.  You know what?  Even that is a little too much of a clue.  I feel like this one, we'll just announce the station when it's time.  Okay.  And then we'll play the first track.  I got a tree on my house.  That's right.  And there is...  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.

There's some bonus Scott and Todd on the end of that disc.  Oh!  I mean, if you want to just...  Oh!  Okay.  Very good.  We could maybe squeeze into some Jocktober before...  I would like that.  Before the Donald make his big announcement, because I think we're going to have to play  off that for a little while.  Of course we will.  Ooh, the Donald.  Shark attack in California Beach.  What?  Deadly shark attack.

[00:59:00]  Yeah  That's all right  Yeah  Twist or not  Twist  Wow  There it is  Wow  Talk to me, talk to me  That is a legendary performance  Wow  Chubby Checker 
[00:59:30]  With Sabra Cadabra  That was a great day on the Opie and Anthony show  Chubby Checker playing Twist again or Twist?  Which one was that?  The Twist  The Twist, right  That was the Twist  With Sabra Cadabra  That's right  And I do want to tell the story really, really fast  Chubby Checker came in because of Jill Nicolini, right?  Yeah  Wow  And we were celebrating Jimmy's birthday, I believe 
[01:00:00]  Because Sabra Cadabra was in  And Chubby had some kind of new song that no one gave a shit about  Obviously  Yeah  Yeah, it's a few years later and we don't know that song  And also I'm like  I said, hey, how about you do the twist?  We got the band right here  And then either he or one of his people said  Well, Chubby only sings that song for $10,000, $20,000  $10,000  $10,000  So then I looked right at Chubby and I went  Well, then I guess we're not playing the new song today 
[01:00:30]  Next thing you know, there's a lot of whispering  And then Chubby said, alright, I'll do it  Chubby  As long as you play my new song  Hey, Chubby  What was the new song?  I don't know  Oh, the jump  Let's jump again  But we saved 10 G's that day  Anyway, I want to wish Bill Wyman a very happy birthday  The only reason I'm wishing Bill Wyman a very happy birthday  His age is deeply disturbing  He's 76 
[01:01:00]  Is he really?  Wow  He was older than those guys  Yep  Wow  Because Mick and them, what, they're pushing 70  If not 70 at this point  Yeah  But Wyman was that much older, huh?  76 today  Do you have any pictures of him updated?  Bill Wyman  And he retired a long time ago  80, 1980, right?  Is it really that long ago?  Why did my voices do that?  He was a weirdo  Wyman  He looks good for fucking 76  I'm sure that picture's 10 years ago  You never know when you Google image this shit 
[01:01:30]  Right, right  What year these pictures are from  Can we see what year he retired, Sam?  Instead of perusing fucking albums like you're his nephew?  Looking at pictures  He retired really in the 80s?  Early 80s?  Is that really true?  Is that possible?  I think so  Yeah  Is Donald making his announcement yet?  We're still waiting?  Not until later  He's going to take his time?  Yeah  Alright, fair enough  As soon as Donald makes his big announcement on Obama 
[01:02:00]  We'll bring it to you  I kind of love him, though, in a weird way  You want to hate him, but he's so pompous  He's just a joy for everyone  He is a delight  He really is a delight  Thank you, Jimmy  What's a delight?  Oh, there's the mayor, hold on  Just the two of us  Just the two of us  Who set up our studio? 
[01:02:30]  Melody of acid in the sky  Just the two of us  Who sings that?  You and I  As an economist, I mean  Who was that?  Who was that?  Just the two of us was done by  They just put it up there  Grover, Washington  Grover, Washington  I would have never got that one  Grover  I tried to pop on the news real fast  Because the mayor was there with his stupid tiny little soda  What was he doing?  Doing a shot of coke?  I don't know  Well, he's getting sued  So maybe that's what that was about  Good  It might have been some B-roll  But it was Mayor Bloomberg 
[01:03:00]  The mayor of New York City, of course  And his tiny little soda  His little soda  What an idiot  Yeah, he really is a cockat  Yeah  He's just an idiot  How about you worry about fucking animals  Getting out of prison a little too early?  He's very proud of that fucking soda thing  I think  What is it?  D.C. is going to adopt that now?  Or some shit?  Washington, D.C.  Because they all have to fucking  They gotta follow suit  Fucking idiots  Sure  And look, I don't want them banning anything  But when you have a tiny little soda  And some dude is drinking a 24-ounce beer right next to you 
[01:03:30]  Just looking like that  Don't you think there's a real problem there, Mayor Bloomberg?  You dope  The problem is you could never tell people they can't have a giant beer  They'll fucking  They'll go crazy  No  You know who you can't tell is the beer companies  Yeah, that too  Sure  They're more powerful than the soda companies  The soda lobby  That's what that's all about  Yeah  He knows he can't take on the beer companies  Yeah  So instead he does this silly thing with soda  And I don't want him taking on the beer companies  No  I'm not that guy 
[01:04:00]  But you can't tell people they have to have a tiny little soda  When you know that this shit is going on as well  Yeah  That's ridiculous  Ridiculous  Damn it, this dumb little soda  Yeah  I mean, everyone laughs at him  But now you're telling me Washington's gonna do the same shit  Yeah, D.C. is looking to do the same thing  What's wrong with these people?  I don't know  People love  Trying to stop people from misbehaving  Instead of just letting them do what they want with their own bodies  So  Love that  That's what the government's job is 
[01:04:30]  It's an easy thing to do  Look how stupid that soda looks  That looks crazy  That's so small  And when they say  Who's holding up that soda?  You, Sam?  Yeah  You've got animal hands  Well, no, they're not  They look like talons  Oh, God, look at that fucking thumb  Yeah, it's like Paris Hilton's feet  They look bigger next to the soda  How stupid does the soda look now?  Because, I mean  It's horrible  It's children's size  And then Jess goes to take a sip  And half of it's gone  Yeah, when I  Calling her fat? 
[01:05:00]  What did you just say?  Get a Diet Coke  It's a small soda  Is it a Diet Coke or Coke?  Regular  That's what you get  What is it?  Is it a Starbucks cup?  It's, I think  Yeah, I don't know  Is it like this?  No, it's smaller than that  Smaller than this  You know what?  And I didn't think about this  It's really small  Smaller than a grande cup at Starbucks?  I hate this fucking thing  He's an idiot  I hate him  I didn't think about it  At a concert  You know, it's not like  Oh, well, just buy more  You know, you go into a deli  And you want to buy  Like, bottles of soda  You buy two bottles 
[01:05:30]  Instead of the one big bottle  Alright, you can even deal with that  But when you're in a concert  Or something  You can't be  Look, give me five  Of these small little sodas  With ice in them  And all kinds of shit  That you gotta  Oh, what's that, E-Rock?  They only sell you two  What?  What?  You're only allowed to buy two at a time  What? Why?  That's what I was told  At the Barclays  What a fucking  You're totally more bucks each  You can't tell someone  They can only have two little sodas  What the fuck?  What happened to America?  Oh, what's going on  This is what the government does  That's why I laughed at people  We're really free  Hilarious  We're not free in America anymore 
[01:06:00]  You idiots  That went away a long fucking time ago  You can't buy more than two  This fucking pussy boy mayor  Just can't legislate enough  This fucking nanny cocksucker  It was so much more pleasant  To go to Jersey  I went to Jersey on Monday  For wrestling  And got a giant souvenir  32 ounce cup  32 ounce, right?  Delicious and refreshing  Oh yeah, they can't even make  Souvenir cups anymore  No, who wants a tiny little souvenir cup?  Give me a big cup of soda  Sprinkle some coke in it 
[01:06:30]  It's a little rockin' that Stone Cold ET  Yeah, it really was  Yeah, it was alright  Yeah, that's true  Stone Cold  He's gotta get more of a gritty sound  That fucking Big Show, by the way, yesterday  Talking about Stone Cold  Was fucking hilarious  I loved the Big Show yesterday  God, was that great  Mumbling through calling stuff  Yeah  He was really open  I liked him a lot  Yeah, yeah  I think we made a new friend  That's good  Oh, by the way  I never puked in  What's-his-name's limo  Because he was tweeting about that yesterday  One of the Dudleys 
[01:07:00]  Bubba?  Bubba Ray Dudley  For some reason  I was on the radar  Of a lot of wrestlers yesterday  Oh, because I retweeted CM Punk  Because CM Punk was pissed  That he wasn't on our show yesterday  Right  Of course  He could come in any time he wants  He doesn't have to go through his people  If he's in New York  Just stop by  There was some kind of misunderstanding yesterday  So I retweeted saying  Hey, we would love to have you, obviously  And then I guess Bubba Ray follows CM Punk  And then Bubba Ray writes me  He goes  Hey, you wanna puke in my limo again?  I never puked in his limo, though 
[01:07:30]  I wanna set the record straight  I got very carsick in his limo, though  Oh  And I might have puked on the side of the LIE  Oh, okay  You're just lucky the thing didn't explode  You know how limos are  Oh, my God, right?  Wrestling limo  Bubba Ray's a Long Island guy  He did our show  At NAW  And he's like, hey, I'm going home  I'm like, well, I'm taking the fucking train  Like I do every day  And he goes, do you wanna ride?  I'm like, fuck yeah  That's fucking awesome  So the next thing you know  I'm in Bubba Ray's limo  When he was fucking huge  Yeah  He was like the guy 
[01:08:00]  I would love to get taken  With the Dudley brothers  I would love to take a car ride  With Bubba Ray Dudley  Would you really?  Yeah  And then we're, you know  We're getting along  And talking to Long Island guys  And I'm getting so fucking carsick  Because I had the side seat  Side seats and limos  Are not good for the opster  I got a weak stomach  When I'm sitting on the side  Oh, do you?  The side seat in a limo  Yeah  And I'm pretty certain 
[01:08:30]  That I got picked up  Right at LIE  And Deer Park Avenue  Right there  Because I think he used to live  In that area  And I had to go north  And so I got picked up  At that point  And I do believe  I was fucking puking  On the side of the LIE  You did get to the point  Where you had to puke  Yeah, but I wasn't gonna  I wasn't gonna puke  In his actual limo  That would have been  Fucking nuts  Did Bubba laugh at you?  Oh, yeah  Yeah  He's a man's man  That's why I took him yesterday  He really is  I gotta get back to him  What is he up to?  He is  He's doing really, really well, actually  He's in TNA 
[01:09:00]  He's one of, like, the top heels right now  I didn't know that  Yeah, he's doing really well  I'm good for him  Always liked that guy  Very cool guy  He's lost a ton of weight  He's all, like, muscular now  Yeah  Yeah, he's doing great  Well, you should have him back on the show  I'll reach out to him  But why did we mention this?  The big show  Stone Cold E.T.  Well, because I was talking about small sodas  Oh, small sodas  Thank you  No, I was gonna say  The shit that's going on with Starbucks  And this guy's worried about soda  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  What's going on with Starbucks?  The calorie count in those fucking drinks 
[01:09:30]  And you can get the venti cups  Right  Which are massive  And once again, I swear I don't want any of this banned  But you gotta point this shit out to this stupid man  Yeah, it's a hypocrisy  After these dumb sodas  When there's all other things happening  Or is he hoping that it's gonna go to all industries?  Probably  He's the same jerk-off  He's the same jerk-off  Who, I hate Bloomberg  Because, not because of his fiscal policies  But because he, like, he wants the bike lanes 
[01:10:00]  He doesn't give a fuck about people driving cars  You hear about the new one?  They want 42nd Street  Closed  Just pedestrian and bicycle traffic  From river to river  They want 42nd Street  Oh, that's not gonna happen  For the whole  That'd be impossible  Yeah, yeah, yeah  This guy is just a cop-sucking motherfucker  That's fucking crazy  He really is  I said it years ago  And it's getting there  They're gonna close down Times Square for traffic  The whole fucking thing  Yeah  They're pushing those pedestrian lanes more  Oh, yeah  They're squeezing, man 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, they want him to be uncomfortable  I don't know what the traffic pattern would be  That would make sense  But you watch  Another few years  That will be closed  And that'll be just an open-air mall for people  Well, I like to walk  That's all it is  I, with my state trooper bodyguards  Enjoy walking around  And enjoying 42nd Street  That's what I enjoy doing  And when you're a spoiled cocksucker billionaire  You can do things  And pretend that you understand  What regular people deal with  Sounds very feminine  Listen to Bloomberg Radio  My ascot  I like what my ascot blows 
[01:11:00]  When I'm walking down  Fuck you  That's what he calls his friend Scott  His ass Scott  I really  I hate him  He's proud of the soda thing, though  Of course he  He doesn't see that everyone's laughing at him  He loves all those fucking laws  That he puts in place  Yeah, he's a sickening guy  It's not gonna stop people from drinking soda  That's a fact  Sorry, but it's not gonna happen  Speaking of idiots  Really fast  Because I know we're moving into Jocktober  But I saw this in the paper  You got a billionaire here in New York City  Yeah  He's got a hundred million dollars 
[01:11:30]  That he wants to give  Oh, this asshole  Wants to give  Did you see this?  This asshole  Now, you know, God bless him  That he's willing to give a hundred million away  But there's a lot of issues here in New York City  Where the school system alone  Could have used a hundred million dollars, okay?  He decides to give it to Central Park  Really?  What a douchebag  For what?  Exactly  Parts of the park, you know  Are being overgrown by plants and such  That aren't 
[01:12:00]  It's a park  Indigenous  Indigenous  So they want to rip all that out  And fucking, you know  Get other plants in there  And they want to fix up a couple playgrounds in Central Park  Does he like the park?  He loves it  Apparently so  He wants to have better strawberries  So men can hide behind them  He's tired of the leaves blowing away  Yes  He can't hide anywhere  Billionaire gives a hundred million to New York Central Park  What a fuck  I mean, usually when you hear about a guy giving away a hundred million 
[01:12:30]  You're like, what a wonderful human being  Yeah  I have to say, what an asshole  What a fucking asshole  There's so many things you could do with a hundred million in the New York area  Exactly  He gives it to Central Park  Which, by the way, is in pretty good shape  They've been fucking, you know  Putting Central Park back together for a while now  So  Wow, that's  Gotta match me  Give away a hundred million dollars  Just give it away  There you go  What's in the article that I don't know, Sam? 
[01:13:00]  I'm trying to see here  Did we nail it?  Yeah, pretty much  Mayor Bloomberg said  Paulson's gift will ensure that the park remains a peaceful oasis in the middle of the city  So the mayor's all for it  Well, of course he is  More trees  That's what we needed  More trees  Five years for attempted murder  But then more trees  Yeah  What a jizz bag  I do  I do my loops in Central Park  And  I'm here to say Central Park's not hurting 
[01:13:30]  No  If it was a shithole  Then I would go  Okay, that makes sense  But it's in really good shape  Central Park's in really good shape  It's not the 70s anymore  The lawns are all mowed  Nice  Mowed  How about you give the fucking park a couple of rakes?  That's what the park needs  Get the leaves up  Here's a leaf blower  Do we know anything about this idiot?  Giving away a hundred million to Central Park?  Just that he's  Hawaii Central Park  What is the answer to that?  Oh, no, no, no  That's not 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, I need to know  He loves to park  He loves to go to the park  He loves to play Frisbee  You know how I love to park  He loves to play Frisbee  I think so  What a douche  Frisbee  Yeah, I think so  He could buy me a nice apartment for two million  A hundred million, man  We got firehouses being closed down  And teachers, you know  Can't play Frisbee in a firehouse  Come on  People would argue the teacher thing  But I really do believe a lot of teachers are underpaid  And got shitty neighborhoods  But he wants better trees in Central Park 
[01:14:30]  I'll let him play Frisbee right by my building for like 15 grand  If he just gave that to me  Wow, that's a fucking discount right there  Not bad  That's saving some cash  Yeah  All right, let's do some Jocktober  Jocktober  Very psyched  It's Jocktober  A celebration of all things shitty in radio  That's not very nice  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions  That's so bad  Wow  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid 
[01:15:00]  Jocktober  O-M-G  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys  This isn't funny  It's time for Jocktober  I got a tree on my house  I got a tree on my house  Iraq, why is the Jocktober intro so loud?  Why, Iraq?  It's so  Everything we play  Why?  It's so fucking loud  That's just how it's built  I'm sorry, I'll write it lower 
[01:15:30]  It's alright, because over the air it sounds fine  I love that excuse  Great  So I'm going deaf  But as long as it's over the air it's fine  Yeah, I would like to have a conversation with my kids someday  Yeah  The hearing's going, man  Fuck  You won't even know if he's afraid that big robots are chasing  Robots  But we can figure it out  Usually you can figure out where this shit comes from  I'm like, why does he think giant robots are chasing the car?  And I went, oh, the fucking scarecrow, thanks  By the way, I didn't mention the place because it was just shitty 
[01:16:00]  Was it really?  I think even my almost two and a half year old was bored with it  Oh boy  They just had the pumpkins all organized in a little area  Remember when we were growing up, you fucking went out into the fucking  Yeah, you gotta go out and  Pumpkin field and searched out a little bit  Find a pumpkin  It was all corralled into this little area of the farm  Speaking of pumpkin  Oh, here's the soda thing again  Gangnam style, now getting into the Halloween spirit  Fuck, we keep missing the soda story 
[01:16:30]  What's the update on the soda story?  I don't know, I wanted to hear about Gangnam style  Reverend Al looks like a shrunken head  Yeah, it's hilarious  It looks like a shrunken head  An apple?  It's like one of those fucking shrunken heads  You leave outside too long  Yeah, yeah, a rotted apple  Apple and then you make a face on it  His head's like a shrinky dink  It fucking just shrunk down  Look at him  Why are you on TV, you scowling ass?  He just is the worst  People that are on TV are supposed to look kind of inviting and friendly 
[01:17:00]  Look at this idiot  Like those guys  As one that is not a conservative  I'm working 19 hours a day  Because if we get one more of those guys  The last half century  Of civil rights  And women's rights  It sounds like we're about to go into hyperbole  Hyperbole like  Let me get there first  Let's imagine  I mean, the last half century of a lot of things could be at risk  Shut up  I mean, you've got a lot of stuff that people like me grew up fighting 
[01:17:30]  That could get wiped out  In the next couple of sessions  Let's talk about a group fighting  I don't think  I don't think  Section 5 of the voting rights act  Is ever going to overturn it overnight  But there certainly would be a chipping away  And it would be moved more towards a state's rights issue  Affirmative action  Right  Get rid of affirmative fucking action already  I mean, the last decision  The gutter decision  Made that race could voluntarily be effective  We may see this where it could even be considered 
[01:18:00]  Now, could even be mentioned  Which would have ramifications  Not only in higher education  Then it could be carried over in employment  And in contracts  He's just valueless  He stinks  What a fucking race-baiting shit fuck he is  Enough of him  Remember Tawana Brawley?  Remember that fucking shit?  Remember the Greek homo line that you said?  Remember all that?  Reverend Al  Now MSNB  He's with the pride of MSNBC  What a terrible network  Don't fuck yourself  It's a horrible network 
[01:18:30]  They put him on every single show  Crown Heights, yes  Every show he's got to be paneled  He must have something on the MSNBC  Oh my god  It's got to be pictures  Something  The game is a dumb little show  But then he's paneled on everything  Everything they do  They include him  They drag him on there  To fucking bring his race-baiting into it  Uh, Jacktober  Why is this folded over, Sam?  I don't want to blow the mystery here  Blow it?  I think we should just  We're heading to 97.5 Eagle Country 
[01:19:00]  Oh  And beyond that  Why don't we just start with  The Eagle!  Let's just play it  Eagle!  Why don't we just start with the first track?  Let's just play the first track  All right, this is  Kenny Chesney  Don't even  Look at that  All right, but there's a lot of  There's a lot of Eagles  In radio  So it's the Eagle in  South Burlington, Vermont  Right  I'm Brad Paisley  I'm Keith Urban  They got a nice little montage 
[01:19:30]  Of fucking country stars on  Rascal Flatts  We're looking up to Midday Jocks  Toby Keith  We're going on a Station Exploration  Station Exploration  You just want me to play this  Like the sound of that  You'll be all right with it  All right, here we go  Jacktober, everyone  All right, welcome to 12 noon  On your Thursday  It's Eagle Country 97.5  And Nate Logan  And the phone is ringing  And you know what that means  Let's go to it right now  Eagle Country 97.5  Hello  Hi, Nate  Can you believe that the smallest 
[01:20:00]  And the  Come on  I can't do this this year  I told you  I can't do this this year  We're not doing this  Come on  There's an emergency  Come on, we can't do this  Oh no, did somebody get something  The tickets  What happened  Well, here's what happened  Come on, please  Oh, no  And this is why we have to listen  To the Midday Jock  You don't want to do Jocktober anymore, do you?  We have to listen to the Midday Jock  And the Morning Jock  Come on  I really don't want to do this  Because  I want to know what happened  If something was stolen 
[01:20:30]  I want to know what it was  Is there a spin here, at least?  Here's what happened  The station wanted to give away $5,000  Oh no  Somebody, somehow  Got their hands on the money  I don't  I really don't want to do this  You just can't  You don't have  There's so much we can be talking about  And this is why we attack radio  People are like, why do you do it?  Because they're fucking unoriginal  Just carbon copies  All over the country  And they're shitty  Oh, is that terrible?  I don't know who took the money  Oh, please, Sam 
[01:21:00]  Oh, he's disgusted with this  I beg you  But  I'm all for the Jocktober thing  But this could be the last year of Jocktober  But what, Sam  Here's the twist  What?  What's the twist?  Every morning  Oh, no  At 8 noon and 4 p.m.  Oh  Come on, please  The fugitive  Wow, a fugitive  A fugitive  That's what this person's calling  Why does he call in at a certain time, though?  Why is this folded over?  Is there a surprise?  No, I just didn't want you to see all the fugitive calls  Oh, no  Oh, no  I gotta hear  No, no, Sam 
[01:21:30]  Dude, I wanna know what's going on here  Let's get to the bottom  I thought that maybe we could all solve the mystery of who the fugitive is  Because if you can figure out who it is and find them  Yeah  And you walk up to them and say  You have to say, though  Are you the 97.5 Eagle Country fugitive?  Then they'll give you the $5,000  Oh, no  Why?  You know what?  Let's just listen to the first clip and see if we even wanna continue  I wanna know what's going on here  If this thievery is happening 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  This person has not been caught yet  Who thought this was a great radio bit that every fucking station has to do?  Oh, no  Oh, boy  You allow one dopey station to do it and then you go, you know what?  That stinks  Let's go back to the drawing board and figure something else out  They got a, um  They got a Facebook page or not?  What's their names?  97.5 Eagle Country  Join us on Facebook  Let me click here  Oh, that's nice  Click there  Okay, I'll log in  Might as well take a look  Yeah, take a look  Why not?  Hi, Nate 
[01:22:30]  Oh  Can you believe that the smallest and the biggest are only 23 miles apart?  There's that fat lady again  I'm going to snap her picture and then I'm off on another sea-faring adventure  From shore, of course  This is a biggie with ties to the Lake City  But don't worry  There's a sign nearby  Come say hi  I am the Eagle Country 97.5 
[01:23:00]  $5,000 fugitive  Yeah, there is that fat lady again  But more importantly  I'm thinking about this one  The biggest and the smallest are only 23 miles apart  Does size matter?  I don't know  This is crazy  This is why I've never, ever in my career  I've been doing radio since 18  Have respected a fucking radio programmer  Yeah  I'm fucking mad right now  It's terrible  It's not even fun 
[01:23:30]  Because it's like you can't think for yourself and figure out your own shit  How do they have that meeting and bring this to the table?  I'm fucking mad  Oh, it's infuriating  I will say there is a twist this year  Oh  The fugitive is also a rapist  Why?  One guy actually speaks up and goes, this is stupid?  Because that's the shit me and Ant used to do  Because they would shove these dumb things down our throat  And we would turn around and go, no, this is dumb  They don't go as far as to speak up and say that  But, you can tell, that's the midday jock that we just heard 
[01:24:00]  For the noon phone call  Right  The morning guys obviously hate this bit  Because they don't include it in their show at all  They literally just, after a song, they go right to the phone call  Let the fugitive hang up and go to commercial  They don't talk about it at all  The radio guy, the radio programmer is fucking pathetic  That he would bring this to his stupid station  Yeah, yeah, that's probably  That's pathetic  Eagle Country, 97.5, hello  I'd love to be a seafaring fugitive  But it's not fair to you 
[01:24:30]  You'd never be able to catch me  At least I can see where they were made  Not much to look at  But I'll scratch around anyway  Coffee in my starboard hand  Camera in my port side  Find me and say  Ahoy!  Are you the Eagle Country, 97.5, $5,000 fugitive?  $5,000?  $5,000 lousy dollars  Boy, they're one of the cheaper ones  Yeah, you're going to waste your entire programming on your 
[01:25:00]  Yeah  On $5,000?  $5,000 smacking  No one gives a shit in your audience  To try to figure out stupid riddles  I'll tell you who does give a shit  What?  There's pictures of people shitting on their Facebook  That's hilarious  Good  See, their listeners don't want this either  Lyle Chipperson is posting some very nasty stuff  There's a Travis on my house  There's a Travis on my house  Oh, no  It's two black gay gentlemen giving oral 
[01:25:30]  That's terrible  There's a guy on my penis  Dude  Oh, no  Do you like figuring out riddles, Sam?  You know what?  I don't mind it  Oh, Jesus, Sam  Sam, why would you be doing that?  That's a forgery  Oh, is it?  We got someone on the line here  Hello  I am the  I am the serious  Well, not so serious  Fugia Chip  The Fugia Chip  The Fugia Chip is back 
[01:26:00]  Oh, boy  The Fugia Chip is calling up  The biggest and the smallest  Are 23 miles  Miles apart  And they're not rulers  Oh, and they're not rulers  Wow, this is  I can't  Oh, boy  Another riddle  We need more clues now  They will be on my boat  And you gotta come up and say  Chips Ahoy  Chips Ahoy  Fugitive  Are you Lyle Chipperson? 
[01:26:30]  No, I'm not  You piece of cocksucking shit  It's obvious  It's very easy to find you  Definitely Lyle  We know who you are  How much money did you take?  He's gone  Oh, shit  He's just gone  He got pissed off  That I figured out who it was  He did get mad  I think Fugia Chip got mad  That you figured out who it was  Can I do a Scott and Todd bonus  Track here?  Just to  Break it up  Yeah, we gotta break it up  Ah  Cleanse the palate a little bit 
[01:27:00]  That is just  Horrible stuff  These pathetic radio stations  And these pathetic fucking shows  They deserve this jocktober  You know, I felt bad for a little bit  With the Terry Clifford thing  Over the weekend  I don't feel bad anymore  All these shows deserve this shit  You felt bad for Terry Clifford?  A little bit  I'll be honest with you  But they deserve it  Like, how do you  How do you go on a radio show  And then just have your show  Handed to you by some  Some prep service  Or some idiot radio program  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:27:30]  Scott and Todd  Bonus track  And then we'll get back  Into the Eagle Country thing  They're doing the fugitive  That's wonderful  But first, Scott and Todd  This guy had a 1,000 pound bomb  That he bought from an undercover FBI agent  They didn't really identify themselves  No, they waited  You don't like it  They waited  That's not right  You didn't tell me who you were  Trick me  We don't trick each other in Bangladesh  What the fuck?  We don't trick each other in Bangladesh 
[01:28:00]  What happened there?  I don't get it  He was just telling a story about some guy  Who  I don't get it  Bought a bomb that didn't work  What a terrible little anecdote  No, terrible  There's nothing there  And Scott  I mean, yeah  Scott Shannon just  Oh, you tricked me  You tricked me  That's the same guy  That discovered Beth by Kiss  Oh boy, wow  That flipped that record over  And the rest is history  That was pretty amazing  That's the same guy, right?  Yeah  Alright, back to Eagle Country 97.5 
[01:28:30]  In South Burlington, Vermont  They're in the middle of  I would say  One of the worst radio bits  Ever  Ever thought up  If it's that bad  Why does everybody do it?  Good point, Sammy  That's why I don't hang out  With radio people at all  They're idiots  They stink  It's literally like two  Brother Louise and Ron Bennington  I think that's it  I think  Am I missing anyone?  Jerry Shepardini  Get a phone call from the future  Imagine that  Who else? 
[01:29:00]  Who else do we  Who else?  Who else is  Who else indeed?  There's some guys on the road  That are funny  But they're usually  Who kid?  One market guy  Yeah, DJ Who kid  DJ Who kid  Ah, he's a gangster  Spider nigga  Yesterday was hilarious  Did you see the picture?  Ha ha, yes  He was in a Spider-Man outfit  He walked in in a Spider-Man mask  And proclaimed himself  Spider nigga  Because he was  Slinging web on hoes  Yeah, on hoes  And that's  That has something to do  With the opening after the show  I'm confused  No  Doing an after show 
[01:29:30]  After show  It's turned into just a  What the fuck  What the fuck is this shit?  It's turned into a melange  He's just my guest  Yeah, but what did that  Have to do with our show?  Good point  Aren't you doing the post game?  Yeah  I'm very confused  How did Who kid become part of  Our show when we've never  Really had him on?  I think we had him on once  A long time ago  It's a good appearance  We did play the  E-Rock Army jingle for him  That's a little bit  Infusion for you  And he's like  You guys creep  Come on now 
[01:30:00]  Lil Wayne kissing guys  Yeah  He's a troublemaker  He is a troublemaker  He just starts rumors  He's talking guys  Surprised he doesn't have  The big announcement today  About Obama  He'll take credit for it  Yeah  Midday Jock excitedly  Talks to the fugitive again  You hate me, right?  No, I'm fine with both of you  You know I fucking hate this  I think we did this last year  Yeah  And bailed  Because we're like  No, we can't do it anymore  And then a year later 
[01:30:30]  They're still doing the fugitive out there  This is literally  We forget  Happening now  I'm trying to  Alright, it's 12 noon  Phone is ringing  Let's check that out  Eagle Country 97.5  Hello  Hi, Nate  Is Nate short for Nathaniel?  No  Definitely not  Too bad  We both have similar names  Three of these  In a name  Is somewhat rare  Hey, speaking of threes  How about three names?  I'm heading to just  I know the answer  Pause it  It's a religion  Three names  John Wilkes Boat 
[01:31:00]  Give me the fucking money  You cunt  I would just blow up the guy's fog  I'm going to look  Just keep the stupid money  It's $5,000  You don't think that's a big prize?  Well, then you get the idiots  You know, for some people  $5,000 is a lot  I heard you on the radio today  It's at $5,000  $5,000  You guys are making fun of it 
[01:31:30]  As far as having your whole radio station taken over  No, it's not a lot of money  For weeks  For weeks  I'm sorry, it's not  You don't think that they get mad when you say it's a lot of money  Yeah, of course  Of course they do  When I was coming up in the business  We would laugh at $5,000  We wouldn't give that away  And we wouldn't spend weeks  This would be a throwaway  Right  Like a quick weekend contest, maybe  Right  They used to give away trips to see U2 in Ireland  For all expense paid 
[01:32:00]  Such a place  It's a religion to some  And this place is kind of a shrine  Lots of trees around  Even on the streets  Come and get me  But don't forget to ask me  If I'm the Eagle Country 97.5  $5,000 fugitive  Are you the Eagle Country 97.5  $5,000  $5,000 fugitive 
[01:32:30]  Exactly  That was actually  Exactly  That was the last thing that guy said  Before he was yanked out of his car  Right  Oh shit  Exactly  Oh Jesus  Yeah, in this day and age  You're not supposed to talk to strangers  Yeah  Hi, are you the $5,000 Country Eagle 97.1 fugitive?  Right  No, I'm not  I'm the bull who's fucking your wife  Oh  The bull, yes  Oh sorry, I'll keep looking  I'll keep looking  See in their heads  You gotta figure out a dumb riddle  Really?  People just want to get to work  We play the fucking country song 
[01:33:00]  In their heads  They're really thinking  That people are going to go up to like everybody they know and ask them  And when they ask them the proper way  Word of mouth is going to spread like wildfire about this station  Here's the brilliance  Or these radio wizards  This is how they think  They think there's going to be such a frenzy in their market  With everyone just talking to everyone  Spreading the call letters for them  Right  And guess what  In the end  You got five idiots that are very lonely that'll do this  You hear about the fugitive that worked 
[01:33:30]  The 97.1 Eagle fugitive  No one's talking about your dog shit promotion  This is brilliant marketing  I mean we're going to get our own listeners to promote the station throughout the area  You think people are asking their co-workers in the cubicle next to them?  Of course not  Excuse me, are you the 97.5 Eagle Country fugitive?  Wouldn't you be the...  You would laugh at that person  You're the idiot  You're the idiot that's actually paying attention to that horse shit  Yeah  I would lie and say I am  But you have to suck my cock first  Then I'd get sucked 
[01:34:00]  I'd lie  Well that was weird  Three of these and a name is somewhat rare  And it looks like they're heading somewhere with a lot of trees  We'll get this clue posted up to Facebook  You can kind of ponder through it  Get in on the discussion  And more importantly  See all these little key little phrases  In on the discussion  Of course  They want people discussing  Oh boy do they ever  Three of these and a name  Right  I know the answer  You don't rarely 
[01:34:30]  You rarely have three X's in a name  Think about it  We'll be right back  Think about it  And that's what they're hoping for  Think about it  Is that Facebook page  I want to see that Facebook page  Is there a lot of discussion  Let me see what the discussion is like  There's probably a lot of...  Wait  Well what happened  There's a picture of a blonde kid  Who they're naming  Hudson Hughes  2022  Saying dad I don't want to go viral  With birds eating at him  That is funny shit right there 
[01:35:00]  That's a racist one  And look at this one  It's Adolf Hitler  But he's dressed up like a 90s rapper  And it says  How much did the holla cost  Wow  Oh grandma  An old lady grabbing two black cocks  What's she doing  Well that's what you should be doing  With your elders  Oh wow  I would assume she's enjoying that  There's a tree on a person's house 
[01:35:30]  With dicks all around it  With the big black ones  Like hovering over the house  Oh my god  Oh my god  Is this a discussion  That these people are having  There you go  Apparently this fugitive  Has done a lot of damage  Yeah  Who's that?  Anthony Kumi  A circuit 76  Child of the 80s  Is that really you?  No  I never owned a Datsun 280Z  That's a cool picture  Did you have one of those  See through t-shirts like that?  No  I would never have worn one of those  Oh god  I hate that one 
[01:36:00]  I had the snot in the mouth  What type of  Wow  That's a terrible cigarette right there  Nigga boy king sized  Licorice cigarette  Licorice cigarettes  Was that ever really  An acceptable product?  It looks like  Ever  Jesus  It looks like it  Oh no  Gary Sinise  Who's that lady?  My fat wife Susan  She's a fugitive  Someone  I am a fugitive  And I stole  I stole a metal  Titanium legs  And a fat Asian woman  Oh come on  Some tar soap  We all know 
[01:36:30]  Here's the clue  That came from  Oh god  She looks like Buddha  And she's heavy  That woman  That woman has a penis  Wow  What a good girl  This is a picture of Harley from Lost  Harley from Lost  I thought that was Big Jay Oakerson  Oh god  Tiny little penis I guess  That's a sad sad penis  Nice cliff  Oh there's another  That's hot  I mean that's  Another lady with a penis  Jimmy  Oh no  Facebook  You can kind of ponder through it 
[01:37:00]  Get in on the discussion  And more importantly  Get out there  And ask everybody  You've come across  If they're the Eagle Country  97.5  Ask everyone  $5,000 fugitive  That's what they're hoping  That's what it's all about  It's get a buzz for the station  It's not going to get a buzz  $5,000 isn't going to get people  Asking fucking strangers  Do you think  Everywhere in Vermont  People go  They keep hearing  About this fugitive  No  No  Because what happens is  Every time you say  You're the $5,000 Eagle  97.1 fugitive  The person goes  No I'm not  I make maple syrup 
[01:37:30]  Either that or  No  No I don't  I sell pine cones  That's all they do  In a dumb state  Picture a gym  In some white boxer briefs  That's a hot shot  That's 2003  Opie was there for that picture  But this caption  Yes I was  That's 2003  Yes or 4  No way  The caption says  Cutie sweater boy  That's not what they called you  No no  You called me sweater boy cutie  Sweater boy cutie  That's what I thought  Yeah sweater boy cutie  Were those your underpants

[01:38:30]  Right  Yeah  Why don't we play another clip here  And then  Other fugitive clues  I'd love to read some fugitive clues  Yeah maybe you guys could  I wish the fans were putting up fugitive clues  Yeah  Fans of their  Yeah their fans are putting up  Fugitive discussion clues  Right  That's what they want  Like riddles  Oh here's  Riddles  Here's the morning show  Taking a fugitive call  I have hope for this show  I don't even know their names  Because they take the call  But it's obvious  They don't want it to be part of their show  Right  Oh wow  This is just coming 
[01:39:00]  Straight out of a song  They do a discussion  They do their breaks  But then this is just coming out of a song  Eagle Country 97.5  Yeah hello  It's Friday  Time to kick back  Let loose  And get ready for the weekend  My day involves shopping  And lots of it  I may need some help  Reaching the top shelf though  Someone will  I know the answer  Oh oh  The fucking fugitive

Well I was going to come in here and say that Rizzo was next Thursday not tomorrow  Oh okay  But as far as I know  They were waiting on a part  I think that's what Rob said last week  And they were supposed to be on  It applies to the microphone  They were supposed to be on Monday  And now I hear it's going to be a little later 
[01:46:00]  That's terrific  That's terrific  A little later huh?  I'm making a list that I'm handing over to Liberty Media  I'm not that bitching guy anymore  But I'm going to make a list  I think you're bitching  And I'm fucking handing it over to Liberty Media  I'm going to get in their good graces  The unnecessary voice  Why?  That's a surfer voice  I kind of like that you think I'm bitching  Why don't you go to the Clues store and buy a bunch 
[01:46:30]  They did that with Clues School yesterday  Yeah why don't you go there and get one  Nice  They don't give things out at schools  Yes they do  They do  Hopefully they give out green flannels  What do you like money or something?  What does that mean?  I don't like what you say  I don't like the voice  Yeah well why don't you go to the like store  And buy a little like  And then you'll have some  Don't give too much of this away  SNL will rip this off  It's too good 
[01:47:00]  It's too good  Why would I go to a place that's giving out shirts  Very similar to the one I'm already wearing?  I don't know  Maybe you should ask yourself  That question  I hate Valley  Grody  I hate Valley  Fugitive  Can I ask you  What borough of New York do you live in now?  I live in Queens  What's happening Fugitive? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah what happened Fugitive?  No nothing  I actually  The dog just walked a little bit too  The dog walked a little bit too  This is the Opie and Anthony channel  On Sirius XM  In this country  Prosperity has never trickled down  From the wealthy few  Prosperity has always come  From the bottom up  From a strong  And growing middle class  This is not about a few people doing well 
[01:48:00]  But it's about giving everybody the chance to do well  Just because you have an individual right to bear arms  Does not mean the state or local government  Can't constrain the exercise of that right  I think that people are blind  If they don't see that he's been trying  And he's just sincere about it  And we can only hope for four more years  Of Obama that's for sure  That's what the American dream's about  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show 
[01:48:30]  Doin' uh what?  Jocktober I guess  There is an update by the way  An update?  What do you mean?  Hopefully some discussion on this fugitive  What's happening?  We were talking about the  Fugitive clues on  97.5 Eagle Country's Facebook page  Phase 4 achieved  There's no Facebook page 
[01:49:00]  There's no Facebook page?  It's gone  What happened?  I don't know  Their listeners must have gotten carried away  The fugitive might have stolen their Facebook page  Maybe  I stole your Facebook page  And put up Black Hawk pictures  Also we have  I don't know if you want to get right back to the fugitive  Or if you want to get an update on a previous Jocktober  Well I got an update on one too  Well  Terry Clifford Station still hasn't put up the Facebook page  I think they're waiting until November 1st  We're such idiots

[01:54:30]  Wow  And Eagle 97.5 country  The station that's been  Taken over by a fugitive  Who we're profiling today  Their Facebook page  No longer exists  It was taken down  So  Jesus  We're doing Facebook  A favor  Clearing out a lot  Of those pages  Sure  Yeah we are  Clearing out some  Server space over there  For Zuckerberg  We're pretty good  Actually I guess  The stock went up  Facebook  Stock  Must be  Because they know  There's so much  Free space  That must be it  Yeah I guess  Their advertising money  Is up  Nice 
[01:55:00]  Good for them  Some shit  Yeah up  Wow  Facebook up  $4.07  In aftermarket  Yesterday  Pre-market today  What is it up to  23 how many guests  23  And what was the  23.51  I bought like  30 or 29  So I'm still  Bumper  Yeah bully me  It's not  I bought 2 billion shares  2 billion shares  Maybe their stock  Is up because of  All the new  Facebook users  Because of all the  Fake Jocktober profiles  That were opened  Let's get back to Jocktober  Eagle Country  97.5  In South Burlington 
[01:55:30]  Vermont  And we're in the middle  Of another dumb station  Doing that dumb  Fugitive bit  Come on Ope  Let's give it a chance  Somebody took 5 grand  From the station  Why would they  How come no one  Stocks the same fugitive  Everywhere and they  Never get arrested  They're never prosecuted  They give their money back  So I think it's like  You know  You scratch my back  Type of thing  And uh  Well the midday guy  Not only is all in  With the fugitive bit  He's teasing  That a phone call  Is coming soon  Oh no he's not  I love when they  You can't tease 
[01:56:00]  A phone call  Is coming  If you're gonna do it  Then try to at least  Do it like the right way  An anonymous phone call  Right  And you tease  That it's coming up  Eagle Country  97.5  It's Nate Logan  Is it closing in  On noontime  On your Monday  Is it closing in  On noontime  I was just gonna  Is it closing in  Closing in  What happens  When we close in  On uh  Fucking lunchtime  On your Monday  Oh  Radio guys  Fucking stink  On your Monday  Your Monday  Why don't they just talk 
[01:56:30]  Yeah  Logan as we close in  On noontime  On your Monday  And got another call  Coming in  In just minutes  From our Eagle Country  97.5  $5,000 fugitive  Now 8 o'clock this morning  She called up to tell us  Well  Having a good hair day today  But she says  Her dirty blonde locks  Don't require a lot of work  To keep them looking good  So that tells us a little bit  I know who the fuck  A few Jim is  Oh there's some lady  With fucking cancer  Oh get me that  Fucking thing  You maple syrup cunt  Holy shit Chip  Chip takes the fun 
[01:57:00]  Out of everything  I kinda like it  I'm supposed to be the guy  That does it  But  I'm in  We gotta get a collection  Together and send  Jimmy up there for a week  Just bothering locals  As Chip  Are you gonna fuck  A fugitive or what  Fucking snorting  Don't require a lot of work  To keep them looking good  So that tells us a little bit  She's dirty blonde  She's probably short  As we figured out from  I think it was our Friday clue 
[01:57:30]  And obviously a female  So  Yeah  I guess that's what  We're working with today  She also said she was  Gonna spread out  With a coffee  A bagel  And pray that the grinding  Doesn't spoil the groove  Of her Monday grind  Doing a little work  It sounds like  But where  Where is there a lot  Of grinding  Going on today  I don't know  Maybe noon time  Will give us that little  That little extra boost  We need to get out there  And get that money back  But remember  If you're out there  And you're on the hunt  You gotta ask that question  Correctly  Are you  The Eagle Country  97.5  $5,000 fugitive  Oh my god  I'm like  I'm really just mad 
[01:58:00]  This is just  It's so bad  This is our business  That was a tease  That was the whole thing  That wasn't even a new clue  No  Just a tease  That was a tease and a recap  Just a tease  Because the midday jock  Has nothing better to talk about  Than this culprit  You think the midday jock  Is also the PD  I would assume so  Oh you know what  Nothing better than a PD  Slash on air personality  Most likely  You really like them  Love them  Oh they're the worst  He's got  And he's gotta  He's gotta double promote this thing  Because he's gotta make up  For an uncooperative morning show 
[01:58:30]  Do you know what  That's a great point  Maybe it is the PD  I learned about the morning show  I will reveal that  In a minute or two  You're like the fugitive  Oh  I got fucking people everywhere  You're like Donald Trump  You're the fugitive Greg  Oh man  Donald Trump  He's got a secret  I'm gonna  I'm gonna tweet it  He's gonna expose it  You should be the Greg  What's my Twitter  I forget  Anyone  I think it's OP Radio  Oh is it  Oh wow  Look at that  Wow  Either that or not Sam  I don't remember  Oh  Sam 
[01:59:00]  See how I did it  In almost a clever way  No  No  I said almost  What the fuck  Um  Let's see  Dignity  You looking forward to him  Nine o'clock  Oh boy  Just  And then I told him  You gotta stop what you're doing  The year was 1953  Someone started a Jim Chandler  Twitter account  It just says  Opie hates me 
[01:59:30]  And I'm stuck working with this  Sucking retard  This is a picture  I'm gonna visit Jim Chandler  No don't  I really  I really would like to  Like  That's a bridge I would love to rebuild  With my old pal that I started radio with  You cock  That showed us  Woody and Jim  Um  So then  The midday guy  Teased  The secret phone call  And then the secret phone call  Comes in 
[02:00:00]  All for five  Stupid thousand dollars  And you know what  Jim had probably told his partner  Like yeah  Opie's a buddy of mine  Like we go way back  Oh they probably had discussions  Over the years  Yeah  Yeah he's a good friend  Oh is this your buddy  Really  Good dude  Have you checked our Facebook page  Jim  Yeah  You suck  Opie says you stink  I'm gonna reach out to the guy  Oh  I follow him on everything  Does he follow you on Twitter  He doesn't follow me  Not on anything  He doesn't want anything to do  I kind of  I think it's hilarious  Dude  Jim 
[02:00:30]  Who did you start out in comedy with  Like Florentine  Florentine  Can you imagine  Florentine  I could hate you  Knowing what you've been through together  Yeah it would be terrible  Like all our dreams  And  Can you imagine  Aspirations  We're running the radio station  During the summer  Cause we believe in what we're doing  No he hates me  And now it's just  We were making fun of comedians one day  And like Jim Florentine  Had not gone on to become famous  Or whatever  And like halfway through  Bashing this unknown comic  You realize the reason  The voice sounded familiar 
[02:01:00]  Was because it was the guy  I don't even think he believes me  Like he really thinks  Like I had no idea  You did not  Whatever  I mean it's over  Yeah  I mean we were so into it  Like there was a lightning storm  Coming through Genesee  I'll tell you some Jim Chandler stories  And the production studio  We're like working on production  For the station  That no one's listening to  By the way  But we're trying to get our skills up  And we actually put microphones  Right next to the screen  So we could capture some lightning strikes  Thunder actually obviously  Yeah 
[02:01:30]  And then we put those into the promos  For the station  Oh man  I might even be able to find it  Real thunder  Real thunder  After we said something like  89.3 WGSU  I gotta dig in some boxes  But I do have some cassettes  With some college radio shows  I'll throw myself under the bus  To end Jocktober this year  For the people out there  They need to understand 
[02:02:00]  The last day of Jocktober  Is where we fucking just  You gotta bring them in soon  So we can digitize them  And all that  Well doesn't Jock have something  I don't have a lot of faith  Yes he does  God you say it  And I'll say mine  I was gonna say hopefully cancer  What were you gonna say  I was gonna say gravity  Jock?  No  I thought you were saying  It might have something  No  We gotta end this thing with  Do you know what we're talking about?  Oh no 
[02:02:30]  I played the thing earlier  To go to break  Oh  He doesn't know  Alright he's gotta leave that  He's gotta  He can't be in there anymore  Jock  You're not listening  Jock what were we just talking about?  What were we just talking about?  Please tell him  We're doing something else  Behind the scenes  I was looking at you  You were looking down  What are you doing?  Yeah  Line one  People understand  He's in the nerve center  Like he should be paying more attention  Than literally us  We were doing something  For what you're doing here  I swear to god  I saw you just looking down 
[02:03:00]  At the board  What were we just talking about?  I don't know  I was doing something else  What were you doing?  Do you realize we're one  Something I was asked to do  By who?  We're one of the biggest radio shows in America  And this shit goes on  Who asked you to do something?  Who?  Who?  Who?  This gentleman right here in front of me  Sam  I mean I told him to get somebody on the phone  Oh okay  But like he could have just been like  Can I tell you something?  Yeah  I'm in on this one too  The guy's already on the phone 
[02:03:30]  Way before we said what we just said  You know what I'm talking about  Yes  So why did you just tell us off?  Yeah  What are you talking about?  No no he was on the phone already  Before you should have heard  Yes  What you should have heard  Okay  Yes  So what happened there?  See the task he had to do  Has been completed  It was completed  Before we said  Yeah  Do you have any  You know  So were you just staring at the phone  To make sure it didn't fall off the console?  No  Oh  What happened here on?  What happened?  Comment  We got  We finally got him on the phone  Yeah 
[02:04:00]  He wasn't answering  Uh huh  But he was up  It was up there before  I saw that he was up there  Because I was debating  Going to him  And then we did our thing there  That I don't want to say  And then I  We did a second  Of when we got him on the phone  No  Yes  Nope  Nope  What were you doing  What were you doing?  Come on Iraq  What were you doing?  Comment  I love when Iraq doesn't know what we're doing  Which is always  It's hilarious  It's just really funny 
[02:04:30]  He's right there  He's right there  We can ask a guy  Like at a drive-thru  Trying to order breakfast  And he would know what we were talking about  I love when you asked him  What we were doing  And he just said something  That made no sense  Yeah I just played it  That was the best  I love how he at least tried  He did try  He did try  He really takes a potluck stab at it  You think he likes taking a stab in the dark  He's like hoping  You know how many times  He's probably been right  That's the thing  He probably  There's probably been a hundred times  Where he's gotten right 
[02:05:00]  Oh he guessed it right  Play that Iraq  And he just hits a button  It's hey Jude  Oh I hope so  And by the  The task he was doing  Behind the scenes  Takes probably five seconds to do  And yeah  Because you just tell somebody to do it  Oh that's so funny  Exactly  Oh that's so funny  It happens so much  Yeah it's amazing  I don't know  Iraq  Coming  Well keep asking  You're not getting a different answer  How long did you tune out of the show for?  Last I heard  He was recording  Thunder and Lightning Strikes  While we were trying to get the 
[02:05:30]  Yeah that's good  That was almost close  Oh man  Alright  And then talking about  If you know  I asked  He wasn't a successful comic  And Jim was doing the same thing  We were doing  With Jocktober  I asked if  We have something to play  For the last day of Jocktober  Where we make fun of ourselves  To show the world  That it's all just fun in the end  Yeah  Yeah  We're working on something  Oh  Wow  You said no though  You said no  And then you said we played it  You said no  I already played it  And you said I already played it  What do you guys do?  How do you tell? 
[02:06:00]  It's like Iraq  You want to know what I thought?  I thought you were looking for  The bit I played going to break  Because of the person I have on the phone  That was so funny  Yeah we want to get us  You know  And things that we did  For Jocktober and stuff  Yeah because we're guilty  We played it already  See  Because in the end  Wrong guests  In the end  We're guilty of a lot of this shit  That's great  That we make fun of  So you don't have to point it out  We acknowledge that  Idiots  What are you working on? 
[02:06:30]  A hint?  Fucking Iraq  Or do you need my college radio tapes?  Those would be very nice  But they're like weather breaks  And boring stuff  So I mean  I'll bring it in  Weather breaks are gold  Yeah  I did the Genesee Valley forecast  Oh come on  That's great  That's what I want to hear  We've done five years of like  Early O&A stuff  There's not  I don't want to blow you guys up  But there's not that much  Horrible  Oh man  Opie and Anthony material  Isn't that true?  You guys are a good show  You're so right Sam  You know 
[02:07:00]  But if you go back to the AAF days  It's probably  In the early AAF days  Multitude  That's the region we're looking at  Again?  Bra bombing  We did bra bombing  We did the turkey off the roof  Oh boy  People were taping more than you thought  That's Kevin from Connecticut  That cocksucker  Curse man  Curse man?  What the hell was curse man?  Kevin from Connecticut  Saying I have a big curse man  What was curse man?  I don't remember curse man  Dude what was curse man?  It sounds familiar  Kevin what was curse man? 
[02:07:30]  Curse man  I'd like to get a copy of curse man  Curse man  It rings a bell  Don't just send it in  I mean  What is it?  Kind of  Give me a little explanation  A little synopsis  Curse man  Curse man  I'm trying to remember  I bet Iraq was writing down clues  For who the fugitive is  Trying to figure it out  Blonde logs  Coke floats in my cup  What is the recipe for a perfect Coke float?  Iraq told me that he likes to do 
[02:08:00]  It's three eighths of a glass  Of Coke  Okay  And then two and a half scoops of vanilla ice cream  Two and a half scoops?  He likes more ice cream than Coke  Is that true Iraq?  That's his recipe  That is not true at all  When I have a Coke float  It's a little less ice cream  A little more Coke  But he likes the ice cream  What's the perfect recipe for a Coke float?  I don't know  I don't make Coke floats  That's part of the jingle 
[02:08:30]  Or our O&A audio contest  And we got at least eight new ones to play today  Coke floats in my cup  Was that the problem?  Is there Bikini Girls on your screen?  Bikini Girls?  Hoagie in your mouth?  Can they update that with not listening?  That would be awesome  Yeah  That would just be awesome  He just doesn't listen 
[02:09:00]  He's probably just listening to Scott and Todd  He's running the actual show  He never listens  But he's not listening to the show  I know people like to say that I'm on the board  But I'm not really on the board  Iraq is really on the board  I got a couple little buttons in front of me  But nothing  Iraq at Mission Control  We've had a problem  Right  Everything okay?  Everything's good, right?  So you go to the moon?  The best is taking a stab at what we asked him  Oh, it's the best  Oh my god  He could have been further from the show  He's always wrong  Always 
[02:09:30]  Not only does management  And then he gets mad at us  Not only does management not like the show  But it's become clear  Iraq is simply not a fan of the show  Not a fan  Not a fan  He's not entertained by the show  No  Is there weak grass in that?  If there is, I could die  No, there's no  Thank you  Where'd you get that?  I thought they were close  Why didn't you ask Jimmy for one?  Why wouldn't you do that, dude?  Roland  Roland told me  Nah  I asked Roland for some vegetable juice  It's a matter with you  But I can't do the weak grass  Because I'm allergic to trees and grass  I'm going to give you a veggie juice  I've been drinking a lot of the fucking veggie juice 
[02:10:00]  Just wanted to stop the show  Oh  Good job  By the wide shoulder Asian  That makes it for you  I love her  I don't like it  She says hi, Jim  Ugh  I hate you  How's that possible?  She loves me  I'm such a nice guy when I'm not here  How does she like you?  Are you a weirdo?  Yeah  Are you considered a weirdo by people?  Why would you think  Why?  I don't know  He just comes off like  This kid couldn't be nicer  He just comes off like a weirdo  He looks like he's been raised properly  Yeah 
[02:10:30]  I think so  He's got a north face  Were you bullied?  No, not at all  Richard Speck glasses  Yeah  It might be the glasses  They're a little intense  A little over the top  Alright  I'm just wondering if you were a weirdo  Still dating that Puerto Rican chick?  Oh, you're dating a girl  You know there's a possibility  You could be knifed in the middle of the knife  Oh my god  You know that, right?  You know what they love doing?  Cutting your dick off if you cheat  That's right  They will cut a dick off in a second  Oh, really?  If they're not?  Really? 
[02:11:00]  Hispanic girls aren't crazy?  Whoa  Okay  Really?  Shit doesn't just come up out of nowhere?  Why don't you just go to sleep?  Why don't you go to sleep?  Really?  They're not entitled princesses  You want some more milk?  Mmm  They feel like the whole world owes them something  Even though they don't even work at anything  Really?  What's this number on your phone?  Who's blowing you up?  How long have you been with her?  Uh, over two years  Over two years?  Yeah, over two years  Is she pressuring you for anything? 
[02:11:30]  Uh, no  She did it one time  Uh-oh  What was it?  To maintain your erection?  You gotta do that, dude  No, she was  She just  She wanted to  To kind of move things a little faster  Oh, like what?  How old are you?  22  How old is she?  She's  67  21  She should be a grandma by now  Yeah, right  That's why she wants to move this along  Move things along  She wanted to get married?  Old maid 
[02:12:00]  She just wanted to move things faster than they were going  What does that mean?  Yeah, what does that mean?  She wanted more time and everything  More, you know, attention, I guess  And you were like, this dick has some pussy to get in, bitch  Damn  Yeah  Wow  Well, it was when I got back from Disney  And she just  I guess she won it all the time at once  You used to intern at Disney  On the roller coasters  What?  What did you do?  Really?  I worked at a rock and roller coaster  Nice  Oh, the Aerosmith one  Yeah, it was good  It was a fun time  Oh, did you go on it a lot?  Every night  Every night?  Every night

The intern  Of course the intern's going to make sure  Everything's working properly  Not some kind of roller coaster engineer  Yeah  That's good  With the guy doing college credits  That's good  That's one of those magnetic fucking roller coasters  That's pretty fucking wild  How high does it go?  It doesn't go very high

Ragdoll  Got a little annoying  Oh, yeah  But it's a complete loop  It's only about four or five songs  That they always play  What are the four or five songs?  Ragdoll  You better remember them  They do  You know what they do  When the roller coaster ends?  Why?  Love in an elevator  But  They change the lyrics  So right as the roller coaster ends

Oh, no  The after show  The same way the connection is  The after show really  Has nothing to do with us anymore  Nothing to do with  The O&A show  A little strange  I remember when Sam  Came to me with the concept  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That was funny, right?

I don't know what this is  I don't know  This is terrible  Alright  Get the hell out of here  Please  Aw 
[02:18:00]  Remember the midday guy  He teased the fugitive call  Well, here's the fugitive's  12 noon at Eagle Country  97.5 time  Once again to check in  With our Eagle Country  97.5  $5,000 fugitive  Let's go to the phone  Eagle Country, hello  Double, double toil and trouble  Nate  An unexpected detour  In my afternoon plans  The invitation was generous  But what to wear?  This is my dilemma today  Add on my millions of other tasks 
[02:18:30]  And my cauldron is boiling over  There's never enough time  What's this mean?  I need to get my priorities straight  Unloading the burden of this money  Is first on my list  Come get me, my pritties  I know who this is!  It's the fucking Wicked Witch of the West  You cocksucker  Hand me that money  Or I'll put my foot in your cunt  Chip is so fucking violent 
[02:19:00]  Oh my god  This is how the contest should be running  Get me, my pritties  I am the Eagle Country 97.5  $5,000 fugitive  Huh, I'm not sure if that's a reference to witches  Or if that's a reference to the Wizard of Oz  Or maybe both  I don't understand  Or maybe both  Am I stupid?  I don't understand the clues, really  No  Because they're dumb  They're long-winded and vague 
[02:19:30]  And I understand they gotta be vague  But they don't make sense vague  It's dumb riddle shit  The promotion works the same every time  You have to write down keywords  You just keep  Someone has time for that  Eventually, they drop the voice changer  And then they'll be like  I'm gonna be at the corner next to Starbucks  Yeah, then you go there  Because no one gives a fuck  No one cares  They finally realize  Okay, well, this cycle's over with  We gotta give the money away today  They think people are getting together  Going, so who do you think the fugitive is?  They think they're having fugitive parties 
[02:20:00]  Where they all get together with their clues  And share information  Because they've joined the discussion  And like the Happyland Social Club  Oh, no  What happened?  Uh-oh  Somebody mentioned me and the Eagle  And they only have 136 Twitter followers  Aw  What?  Most of our listeners have more than that  That's weird  How do you  How does it  Ah, whatever  Um  It's Cotton Todd  Bonus track  Oh  Before we 
[02:20:30]  Give you the conclusion of this year's fugitive bit  Oof  Here's Todd  Does some Bubba the Love Sponge humor  Oh  But Scott does his darndest to put an end to it  Without the help of the FBI  Hulk Hogan has gotten to the bottom of his sex tape scandal  He says it was his ex-BFF Bubba the Love Sponge  And Bubba's ex-wife Heather  Who's in the video with him  He also blames the website Gawker  For releasing the footage 
[02:21:00]  He wants $100 million from Gawker  $100 million  What's he want from Bubba and Heather  Undisclosed  Probably not quite as much  Yeah, he doesn't have $100 million  Isn't that a contraceptive device?  Bubba the Love Sponge  Just insert the Bubba the Love Sponge  Just don't worry  And go at it  And have a fun time  You'll be confident knowing you're wearing the Bubba the Love Sponge  I don't think that's what that is  I don't think that's what that is 
[02:21:30]  I don't think that's what that is  I don't think that's what that is  Was that Scott that stopped Todd?  Yeah, at the end  Yeah, that was literal Scott  I don't think that's what that is  Guy's worth millions of dollars  And that's what he added to that  There's a sponge in my vagina  Wonderful  Someone mentioned a laugh  And he went  I don't think that's what that is  That is  Nice  Thanks  Back to Jacktober, Eagle Country 97.5.  And South Burlington, Vermont.  So now we get back to the morning show. 
[02:22:00]  They've got to do their call.  The reason why they're not playing along is because they're a syndicated morning show.  Oh, so they're just throwing that little break in that is local.  As a local thing, yeah.  Wow.  The morning show actually has no idea this is going on because they're too busy doing their syndicated show.  Whoever they are, I don't even know where they are.  Interesting.  Oh.  All right.  This must be The Fugitive, Eagle Country 97.5.  Hello.  Good morning, Big D and Bubba. 
[02:22:30]  And that's why there's a pause there, too, by the way.  Yeah.  You notice that?  Yeah.  That's all technical shit, I guess, but it gives the local a chance to pop in.  And they had the guy read a few liners just so it almost sounds like they're part of it.  He's taking the call.  Right.  All right.  This must be The Fugitive, Eagle Country 97.5.  Hello.  Good morning, Big D and Bubba.  It's Extreme Makeover Fugitive Edition.  I know who this is! 
[02:23:00]  Oh, my God.  It's somebody who was burned in a fire.  Put on that shitty wig and give me my fucking money.  I don't know where you got that from.  I don't think you're right, though, either.  Holy shit.  Makeover Fugitive Edition.  Because of this makeover.  Dirty Blonde is out.  You know, I've always wanted to be a brunette.  My cowboy boots and this yellow purse are definitely getting the looks this morning. 
[02:23:30]  I am the Eagle Country 97.5.  The $5,000 Fugitive.  WT.  Oh.  Oh.  Fuck.  Good God.  It's that terrible radio.  I love how the Fugitive has to say the name of the show and everything.  The calls.  Well, because people are going to join the discussion.  Yeah, yeah.  They really are.  So not only are you promoting the station, you're promoting the morning show.  Sounds great. 
[02:24:00]  And the midday show.  It's a wonderful promotion.  Good stuff.  Midday Jock takes a call.  This is the last one for today.  Thank God.  Midday Jock's the one that's into it.  He is, in capital letters, interested.  12 o'clock on Eagle Country 97.5.  Anticipation is building and the phone is ringing.  And that only means one thing.  The Eagle Country 97.5.  $5,000 Fugitive Eagle Country.  Hello.  Hi, Nate.  I'm enjoying this beautiful day.  It appears the eagle has landed. 
[02:24:30]  I'm relaxing with some lunch.  I wonder if you could find a hot dog like this in the Motor City.  Anyhow, I'm looking up for a reason.  Catch me and I'll tell you why.  I am the Eagle Country 97.5.  $5,000 Fugitive.  Well, she may as well just be wearing a sign that says,  I am the Eagle Country 97.5.  $5,000 Fugitive.  It doesn't get much more plain and simple than that.  I don't think I need to tell you where the Fugitive is right now. 
[02:25:00]  You can figure that out on your own.  Get out there and ask, are you the Eagle Country 97.5?  $5,000 Fugitive, man.  Unbelievable.  Today might be the day.  Unbelievable, huh?  Real unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  It is unbelievable.  They're trying to start a buzz with 136 Twitter followers.  How about you get social media down first?  Fucking assholes.  Let's get a buzz going.  Man on the street talking.  That is pathetic.  There you go.  So where was the Fugitive?  Some dumb radio consultant came up with this. 
[02:25:30]  An abortion clinic with a bomb.  I'm going to blow all of these baby-killing whores up.  Where am I?  I'm going to blast their sinning vaginas into kingdom come.  You're at an abortion clinic.  I don't think that's what that is.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't think that's what that is.  Oh, Erock's back with us.  Thank you, Erock.  Thanks for joining us.  Yeah, Scott Shannon.  Look at this.  It's the winners.  They got a picture on their website. 
[02:26:00]  What's wrong with that?  And of course, look at the pigs that won this thing.  They're the only ones that would deal with this shit.  Is something wrong with that person on the right?  Which one?  In the middle?  No, the blue.  I think the one in the middle has fucking problems, too.  Yeah.  They're kind of honey boo boo type people.  Yeah.  The one in the middle with the jacket, that's the Fugitive.  Oh.  What?  That's why she's looking like, ah.  That's a she?  Yeah.  Why isn't she running?  And where's the blonde hair?  I guess she's got a wig on. 
[02:26:30]  I don't know.  And what's the sign?  They're blocking it.  Oh, God.  Is that the Fugitive?  Yeah.  That's where she's looking like, ah, you caught me.  Ah, you caught me.  Where are the cops?  Why would they take her picture and put it on the website?  Why doesn't Fats have a fucking sit on her until the cops show off?  What?  Until the cops show off.  Where was it?  It says, uh, obviously in Rose's Point, New York.  Oh.  New York?  Our fugitive's name is Meredith.  It's not in New York.  They're in Vermont. 
[02:27:00]  Vermont, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, then New York, right?  Uh-oh.  Update.  Connecticut, then New York, right?  Our fugitive's real name was Meredith.  And after hanging out for some photos and a few words on the air, she hopped into her  SUV and, true to her word, made for the border.  Oh.  She got out of town.  Yeah, after being on the air and having her photo taken.  That's what you do when fleeing the country.  A few radio IDs.  Yes.  You got to keep it dramatic.  That is dramatic.  Who knows where the fugitive will strike next? 
[02:27:30]  Who knows?  Let's say, hi.  Hi, who's this?  And this is the 10,000 gallons of mayo fugitive.  Oh, my gosh.  10,000 gallons of mayo fugitive.  E-Rock was just complaining that his lunch was stolen.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's right.  I have stolen 10,000 gallons of mayo.  And how could we get it back, fugitive?  Oh, you don't have to go where tons of mayo is sold. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, Bobo, where are you?  It says the 10,000 gallon mayo fugitive.  Oh, I thought we finally had Bobo back in the air.  Bobo doesn't want to come on the show anymore.  This isn't you, Bobo?  We were looking for Bobo.  I don't know Bobo.  I don't know Bobo.  Fugitive.  What kind of dog is Mr. Maloon again's?  I don't know.  I put the guy next.  You want the guy who's carrying mayo.  You are the eyes of New York. 
[02:28:30]  What?  The fugitive.  You are my assistant.  Is the fugitive in the subway?  Fugitive, put your assistant on.  Yeah, this is the fugitive assistant.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, boy.  Bobo, could you put the fugitive back on the phone?  Yeah, that's good.  This mayo is getting heavy.  You can't hold the phone and the mayo at the same time.  Oh.  Very funny.  Oh, this is the fugitive. 
[02:29:00]  Fugitive, is Bobo there?  I was going to say, this is the fugitive's assistant.  He was.  Dumbbell.  He gets a little confused.  Fugitive, is Bobo there?  I've got to ask him about something.  Hold on.  Yeah, this is Bobo.  Who's this?  This is Bobo.  Put Bobo on.  Yeah, but this is him.  Oh, oh.  No, we want to talk to the fugitive.  All right, let me get him all right. 
[02:29:30]  Fugitive, it's it.  He wants to talk to you.  Yeah, this is fugitive.  Fugitive.  I have a question for Bobo about his Twitter account.  I don't know.  Hey, yeah, this is Bobo.  Bobo, what are you doing there with the fugitive?  Yeah.  Oh, I guess somebody's got to help the guy carry the mayo.  Well, listen, we can't let somebody who's stealing from us back in the studio again.  No, that's not good.  Yeah, the thing is, I'm not stealing. 
[02:30:00]  I'm not stealing.  I didn't steal the mayo.  No, you're obviously in on it if you're carrying around E-Rox mayo.  And possession is nine-tenths of the law.  So I don't think we could ever have you back in the building.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, dude, it's not honest.  Let me ask the fugitive.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Yeah, this is fugitive.  Hold on.  Yeah, sir.  Fugitive, is Bobo helping you with the mayo thing?  No, he isn't quite helping me with the mayo. 
[02:30:30]  What?  He isn't quite helping me with the mayo.  I just wanted to show the guy to show someone the mayo.  Look, it took a little while, granted, but we got it done.  It's just too confusing for his dumb, stupid, rotting brain.  So, Bobo, you're not taking the mayonnaise?  No.  No, I'm not taking the mayonnaise. 
[02:31:00]  But the fugitive just said you were.  Yeah.  Wait, put the fugitive back on.  Yeah, ask the fugitive.  He needed to show someone the ton of mayo.  We need to talk to the fugitive.  Fugitive.  Yeah, where's the fugitive?  Right next.  Right next.  Hold on.  Okay, so why is Bobo helping you with the mayo?  He ain't really helping me with the mayo.  I need to show somebody the mayo.  But Bobo said he was helping you with the mayo. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, Bobo definitely said that.  Yeah, well, I didn't tell him.  Um, I, I stole it.  But you did, Bobo, didn't you?  What happened?  Bobo?  Didn't tell Bobo I stole it.  Isn't this Bobo right here?  Uh, right next to me.  Hold on.  Yeah, this guy didn't even tell me he stole this mayo.  He just said for some reason he was trying to do something.  I don't know.  Something with a ton of mayo.  I don't know. 
[02:32:00]  If we listened to the tape earlier, it sounds like you're in on it, Bobo, and we can't have  you here if you're stealing stuff.  Like the fugitive said, the fugitive said you stole it.  Yeah, Liberty Media is taking it out of this company, and they got very strict rules.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what Fuge said.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I found out this guy.  Is this the fugitive?  Right next to me.  Yeah.  Right next to me.  Wait, is this Bobo?  Right next to me.  Hold on. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Wait, is he...  He didn't even tell me...  Bobo, you're the fugitive?  No, I'm not.  But the fugitive didn't tell me the mayo was stolen until...  But it sounds like you're the fugitive.  Yeah.  It sounds very similar.  No.  What's the difference between...  Explain to us what the difference is with Bobo and the fugitive, if you can, quickly.  That's simple.  There's one big difference between the fugitive and Bobo.  Yeah, what's that? 
[02:33:00]  The fugitive eats Bob Brownies.  Holy shit.  I can't do this.  Holy shit.  This is apt to show shit.  Holy shit.  All right, listen.  We got the bonus track from Scott and Todd before we move on.  Yeah, please.  Can we get Pat Cooper in here?  Pat Cooper!  Oh, no.  This will wrap up today's Jacktober.  It's a bonus track from Scott and Todd.  Jack.  Happy birthday to Trish Shannon.  Today's her big day.  Happy birthday.  The beginning of her happy birthday weekend. 
[02:33:30]  You know what that means?  You got to perform.  Yeah.  A lot of pressure.  That's what they say.  A lot of pressure on you.  You're going home.  That's what they say.  You better do it two, three times a day.  Zac Efron.  You better get rid of one here before you go home so you can last one.  Zac Efron, 25 years old today.  He's not going to be able to watch Extra tonight.  He's just ignoring us completely.  Head down, reading about Zac Efron.  He's having a birthday today.  25 years of age.  Oh, my God.  It's just awful stuff. 
[02:34:00]  They really stink on ice.  There's nothing really.  Todd's trying there, at least.  Yeah.  Scott won't have it, though.  Trying to get something out of it.  I won't have it.  I won't allow him to even try or just knock him down.  Yeah.  Write another song parody, cocksucker.  Showhorns from words.  Yeah.  Let's do some break and Pat Cooper next.  I got a wee-wee.  I don't think that's what that is.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Get ready, America.  Today's hottest impressionist is coming to a theater near you. 
[02:34:30]  Jim Norton, man of a thousand voices, live, in concert.  All your favorite celebrities are here.  Bill Clinton.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  Samuel L. Jackson.  That girl got snakes near a plane.  Sylvester Stallone.  Hey, you're going to have to get a lot of body bags if that girl's coming to town.  And Christopher Walken. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, I carried this iPhone in my butt.  Jim Norton, man of a thousand voices, live, in concert.  Coming to a theater near you.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Pat Cooper is joining us in a minute or two.  Really fast.  I'm telling Anthony on my Instagram, I posted a picture of myself and the big show.  I look like a fucking twerp, like a kid. 
[02:35:30]  Huge.  I'm almost six foot tall.  Yeah.  And he just towers over me.  And the comments are pretty cool.  This guy, T-Man 813, he wrote, I used to play high school football in South Carolina  and our team played his team down in Batesburg.  He was a beast.  They would march him out last, letting him walk down the opposing team's sideline.  At that time, he was easily two times the size of any kid.  We had guys refuse to line up against him.  Who's this?  Yeah, I was one of them.  I'm a puss.  A guy that played football against the big show back in high school. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, big show.  Nice car.  You're keeping it up nicely.  Earth, wind, and fire, and little brother.  Pat Cooper!  There he is.  Hello, Mr. Cooper.  Mr. Pat Cooper.  Hiya, Pat.  Go with me.  Take a seat.  All right.  And that guy.  Oh, this guy.  That guy.  What's up, man?  And that guy.  That has to come up with Pat Cooper every time. 
[02:36:30]  I walk him.  How are you doing, sir?  Hi, Pat.  Good to see you.  He walks him here.  How are you doing, Mr. Cooper?  I saw you twice.  How are you, sir?  You've seen me twice on the streets.  Are you from Canada?  I am, yes.  Good.  I'm going to say, well, I'll shake it out.  Don't worry about it.  Come on.  Who are you with?  No taste, huh?  Why don't you offer that?  That's why I've seen you, Jim.  It's good to see you, too, buddy.  I'm not even excited.  Okay, let me bingo right now.  You know why I'm here.  Why are you here?  He was embarrassed.  What happened?  He saw me twice in the week.  And he's, how come you're not on the show? 
[02:37:00]  And I said, you know, I said, if the kid wasn't here, I'll bust your fucking head open.  I said, you know what?  We miss you.  I says, a fucking year.  You miss me.  Was it that long?  It wasn't that long.  No, but I'm sitting there.  But to him, a month's a year, if you know what I mean.  That's true.  He gave one on the throat.  He went, don't pay attention to him.  He knows how to hold.  No, he's got two, God bless you.  He's got two great kids.  But instead of slipping around a corner and not looking at you, he said, oh, where have you been?  Nobody slips around a corner when I'm in the area.  No, I couldn't avoid it. 
[02:37:30]  You couldn't fucking believe it.  You couldn't avoid it?  I did try to cross the streets.  I like it because you don't do shit.  We don't worry about your kids.  We don't worry about your attitude.  You show up, you go through the motions, and then you go to Fox.  That's it.  That's why I respect him.  He's got stuck with kids, but he's got great kids.  One kid looks like Cary Grant with blonde hair.  Cary Grant?  Do you mind?  No.  I don't know what the problem with Cary Grant is.  The kid is handsome, and the girl's like a Lana Turner.  My daughter's Lana.  I don't know who's around today.  Apparently not. 
[02:38:00]  It's Lana Turner.  I forgot about her.  She's around.  Anyway, so here's what we got.  Wait, isn't Lana Turner like a...  I was going to ask you a question, if you don't mind.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Are you on the ghost show?  Because everybody sees ghosts now.  No, no, no ghost show.  There's no fucking ghost in this fucking place, and he's sitting right next to me.  Sam.  Harry the hair.  Joe the brush.  I can't believe it.  Regis Philbin said he sees ghosts.  Joe Rivers sees ghosts.  I said to Joe, and you look in the mirror, you'll fuck it's you. 
[02:38:30]  Who the fuck do you think it is, you dumb, sick bastard?  I saw the commercial for that.  Regis Philbin's like, and it came out of nowhere.  Regis Philbin is sick because he blew a $20 million job.  He thought they were going to kiss his ass.  He found out he's a piece of paper.  It's fucking over.  They're bored with his niceness.  He's fucking over.  He's bored.  You know, and go back to motherfucker, motherfucker.  We want those guys.  He don't want it now.  He's being punished.  He's not doing matinees. 
[02:39:00]  That means senior citizens who are deaf will go to see him.  Oh, shit.  So I'm working with him in Florida to help him.  Yeah.  Because my people are deaf, but, you know, not as bad as his people.  Sure, sure.  But he don't know it's fucking over.  It's fucking over.  I'm telling you like a brother, these guys are finished.  I'm not finished because I'm stubborn.  Yeah.  You understand?  Sure.  When I tell the priest, don't give me your last rides.  Give me the first two.  And they look at you like you're funny.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Now I'll tell you why I lose my fucking breath. 
[02:39:30]  Why?  What happened?  I was in Vegas.  Yeah.  And they got signs.  Give your car to the church.  I got a 1977 Mercedes, spotless, but I can't get parts for it.  So I says, geez, I said to my wife, you know, let me do something good.  I bring it to the church and I give him the deed.  And he says, Pat, God, so father, you know, I hope you're, oh, my Jesus.  I say, and I gave him the deed.  Then I said, do me a favor, father, please.  He goes, yes.  Can you drive me home? 
[02:40:00]  He said, no, I can't do that.  I said, what?  He said, we can't do that.  I said, why?  My old friend, God, he said, well, now this is our car.  We're not insured.  I said, are you out of your fucking mind?  What do you mean you're not insured?  He said, well, if we're driving in an accident, they're going to come, you know, say, where's  your insurance?  Sure.  I said, father, this is called fucking genius.  Give me the fucking thing.  I'll rip it up.  I'll give you another one.  But take me the fuck home.  Take me home.  I wonder taking a care for $12 for giving a son of a bitch fucking shit. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  This is why I lose it.  And he goes to Canada.  You had to take a cab home.  Well, because this is the fucking world.  Yep.  This is the bullshit.  Listen to me.  I can't swim.  But if North was drowning, I wouldn't try to help him at least.  He wouldn't say, well, I'm not a younger guy.  Fuck you, North Drown.  Well, what about they told me at the Bugatti years ago.  I'm working there Friday.  What do you think they said to me, the guy that was running it?  What?  He said, no disrespect.  We love you, but we're looking for younger people. 
[02:41:00]  And I said, okay, let's kill your mother.  And that's what happens.  And I'm a prick.  What are you talking about my mother?  I said, fuck you, because this is unfair.  I got a right to make a living.  Sure.  I said, Jim North goes to Canada because he wants to work.  He's not working here anymore.  They had it up in him.  You know, and he's got the poster out there and don't mean shit.  You want to make that poster happen?  Sign the fucking thing.  Say it to my fan.  Don't say fans.  To my fan.  Don't get cocky. 
[02:41:30]  Don't get cocky.  Anyway, I'm so happy to be here.  This is my year.  Is my year up?  No, it was June or July.  You're good, you're good.  Here, let me explain something to you.  It's only three, four months ago.  Is he talking when I'm talking?  Yeah, I hope not.  Are you interrupting my flow?  I'm sure I think so.  Who's he talking to?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, say something.  Don't leave me here with my cocky.  No, we're not allowed to say it.  No, no, I'm just listening and enjoying it.  I'll be.  Who are you talking to?  Myself.  Are you talking to him while I'm here?  No, no, no.  Want me to come back again?  No, no, never have.  What the fuck do I need to do?  Now, listen.  Yeah, I'm listening.  You're making it.  It turns down to three days. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  And another couple of weeks, it's going to be on this show.  That's when I know he's in deep shit.  And he's going to befriend you.  He's going to befriend you.  I'm talking to the Hamptons.  The Hamptons.  You want to go to the Hamptons?  You're going to go to the Hamptons now.  He went to the Hamptons.  And then his dog died.  I got very upset.  I said, fuck him.  I hope he dies before the dog.  Jesus Christ.  Pat, what happened?  It's so fucking.  This guy.  Well, he was very sad at the death of his dog.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  You guys were buddies.  You were pals for years. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  You never heard the story.  What happened?  The truth.  What?  The truth.  The truth.  I didn't know you guys when we were with him.  You know, one thing I'll say.  He never said, don't do this show.  I will say that.  Because I went to him, go fuck himself.  I said, I'd do Nazi Germany if it means a little publicity.  But, you know, but he never said that.  But what happens is, my argument was, he would tape everybody.  He had spies all over the fucking country.  So one day I said, he's full of shit.  Fuck him, too.  And somebody taped it. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, shit.  And he called me in.  He said, did you say that?  It's what's on the tape.  I must have said it.  He goes, what did you say that for?  I'll say it to you.  Fuck you again.  What the hell is it?  Gene Conner?  What the fuck is this?  Don't pay the interns, you cheap fuck.  Why don't you give these guys at least $100, $200 a week?  They're kids.  This is the future of our country.  You don't go for shit.  He goes, you made them spies, you sick fuck.  Here comes the Nazi party again, you sick fuck.  I said, you ought to be ashamed.  The Hamptons, the Hamptons.  And he went to the Hamptons.  Because the man is a man without a fucking life. 
[02:43:30]  Because when you've got to apologize to your children who are in their 20s, that you're a prick.  Oh, shit.  I don't apologize to my kids.  I tell my kids, fuck face right here.  Daddy, fuck face.  Daddy takes it in the ears.  Daddy is a piece.  He's a piece of shit.  Okay?  Do you love me?  Well, do you love me?  Yes.  All right.  You're back in the will.  Yeah.  He was a good father, wasn't he?  Sorry, help me say something.  I'm trying!  He's only talking street corners, this fucking guy. 
[02:44:00]  There's two things.  Was he a good father?  And what was the actual problem with him that you were trashing him out in the world?  The actual problem was to show him that he was not right all the time and to show him that he was a bully.  If you remember during that era, the word bully was starting to become more important.  Kids went in school with bullies and that.  And I says, Howard, you're the biggest bully on the planet.  He said, you're not an entertainer.  You're a fucking bully.  You accuse everybody. 
[02:44:30]  You go after people.  I said, but when they go after you, you're holocops.  And they started to get a little loose.  I said, you know, something not happy being here.  Fuck you and your show.  And here's what really killed them.  You're getting $12 to say the same shit that you gave these fans of yours for nothing.  So you don't give a fuck for your fans.  You're money hungry.  Fuck.  That's what you are.  You'll die fucking with your money up your ass.  The hampers, the hampers.  I hope the fucking ocean drowns your fucking house.  $20 million.  And I told him, stay away from the beach. 
[02:45:00]  He said, why?  There's water there, you sick fuck.  Water covers over the houses, you sick fuck.  All right.  But he married a girl who loves the dog more.  That's what it is.  That girl is wonderful.  She loves pets.  But he's not a pet.  He's a chinchilla somewhere in a fucking corner.  You understand?  But nobody says that they were scared.  I told that kid, your interns, let's get together and attack this fuck.  Let's pull his fucking hair.  But they're scared.  They got no balls.  I said, don't wait till we draft in the army. 
[02:45:30]  Don't do that.  Let's attack this fucking bum now.  I said, let's show what we're made of.  Let him apologize to us.  They're scared.  They're scared.  And I saw one of your interns.  I said, tell Open Andy, fuck you and your show.  He cussed out of the cry.  He said, then I got nothing else to do.  I said, join the Nazi party.  I said, at least I got a free helmet.  It's called humor.  I love it.  You don't look at sometimes and think that he kind of brought you back, a little resurgence of Pat Cooper years ago? 
[02:46:00]  Uh-oh, he took his hat off.  I know what you're saying.  Anthony, I never deny if I'm wrong.  Never.  It was not like that.  I happened to meet Gary Dallabati.  And he said, Mr. Cooper, when he called me Mr. I knew I was still available around America.  He says, Howard Stern would like you to do this show.  And I said, no, that's what he said.  Who's Howard Stern?  I meant that.  And he says, well, he does this.  I said, OK.  But the first time I had to apologize, I had something else to do.  And I called him up and apologized. 
[02:46:30]  I says, can you make another date?  That was my biggest mistake.  Can you make another date?  And I became a regular because I was, you know, in those days, there was, what's his name?  The other guy that died in a car.  Sam.  Sam McKinnison.  He was upstate.  Loved Sam McKinnison.  Then he hated Sam McKinnison.  Then he loved the other guy with the black jacket who wanted to be an Italian.  Who?  Dice.  Who wanted to be an Italian?  Dice, Dice, Dice, Dice.  You know, and Dice was fucked up with 18,000 people in the arena because of Stern.  I was on Stern.  I was missing eight people a show. 
[02:47:00]  I may tell you why.  Because my humor was not for his young people.  No disrespect to them.  I'm talking about Italian, dis-Italian.  These kids, they'll meet me on the street.  They're hugging me and kissing me.  And Stern was not sure if I was doing comedy with him or if I'm telling him under the table,  fuck you again.  And when he started the tape wherever I was, I'm in Chicago, and I hear on the radio,  he said, Pat Cooper, you just badmock me.  I said, I didn't badmock.  I told the truth.  You're a dickhead.  Let's face it, you're a fucking bully. 
[02:47:30]  I said, you know what?  You're a coward.  Howard the coward.  Coward Howard the coward.  The Hamptons.  The Hamptons.  The Hamptons.  And I drove him fucking now.  When he was walking the street, hey, Howard, the Hamptons.  The Hamptons.  The Hamptons.  He can't beat me.  You know why?  No.  Because I'm so fucking hilarious.  Right.  I tell the fucking truth.  And I don't give a fuck.  I'm trying to commit suicide.  I'm hoping one of his fans shoots me.  And then my children will wind up with something.  They say, what happened?  Who's Howard Stern? 
[02:48:00]  He killed Pat Cooper.  I'll be a fucking idol.  They'll take your picture down.  No disrespect.  You'll really go to New Zealand next time.  But you understand.  And let me tell you something.  When that was going on, I came here.  And he never.  You know why?  He didn't want to go near that.  Because if he would have said, don't do this show.  I said, how about.  Right.  How about if I fuck one of your daughters?  Jesus.  Would you like that?  Because I said to him, who the fuck are you?  You know, that you think we can't talk about your daughters.  You can talk about my mother.  You can talk about my.  Who the fuck are you? 
[02:48:30]  I said, what did you the fuck are right?  So he didn't know what to say.  And then the kids are starting to say, calling me Mr. Cooper.  And giving me hugs behind his back.  See?  So I think somebody, one of his spies, who's a hug spy.  He only sees who's hugging.  Not him.  And he says, Mr. Stein, yes.  I'm the hugger.  Yes.  I caught him hugging.  The kid.  One of my spies, yeah.  Fire the fucking guy.  And they say, what?  And who was the guy he fired?  Donald Trump.  Because Donald Trump is up everybody's fucking ass.  Because he needs authority. 
[02:49:00]  Let's talk about that a little bit.  You hear he supposedly has something on Obama that he's going to announce today.  No, we all know what he's got in Obama.  What has he got?  Space.  What?  What the fuck else has he got?  He's got, he don't have a shit.  He's, let me tell you something.  He says he's got something big.  Oh, give me a fucking break.  First of all, who gives a fuck who wins?  Because they're both full of shit, in my opinion.  All right.  What we need, what we need, I'll tell you how sick this country was.  All right.  America, listen to Cooper. 
[02:49:30]  When Hillary Clinton had a shot to be president, she should have been president, but we would  have had two presidents, her and her husband.  Yeah.  Of course, you know, she would have given him his own room in case he wants to make an  enzalada.  Enzalada.  You know what an enzalada is.  I don't.  Let me tell you, see, your element is you want to get laid, you want to fuck, you want  to go to bed.  I'm an Italian, I go, honey, you want to make an enzalada?  That sounds more classy, but she goes, oh, you want to go to dinner?  No, you sick fuck.  I want to bang you.  I want to fuck you.  So instead of saying that, I'm too old, you want to make an enzalada. 
[02:50:00]  Because when you go to Italy and you say to a girl, you want to get laid, she goes, I  don't know what you talk.  But when you say you want to make an enzalada, they go fucking nuts.  You got to have a little suave.  Right.  That's why you keep going to Canada to get frostbite.  Isn't that just making a salad, though?  No.  What is it?  You it is, because you're not that fucking bright.  All right.  And I don't consider you a Italian.  You're a semi.  Semi.  Italian would never take this fucking job.  They're not going to get up this fucking early for the Pope.  They won't get up.  He's an albino, so he has to get up. 
[02:50:30]  Whoa.  I know how to mix cement.  I'm Italian.  I know how to mix cement.  That's your name, albino.  I'm nice to you on the street.  I love you.  You don't say shit.  You never get in trouble, this guy.  You'll probably become a tremendous politician.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  Anyway, everything all right with you, Bubba?  Everything's good, good.  You know, I come in here, I do the show, like you said, and I just go to fuck home.  Well, of course, you know what?  You got nothing going on.  You don't need anything.  I don't.  And you have no personality that we should talk about.  None whatsoever.  And if you write a book, it's going to be one page, once upon a time, and the fucking 
[02:51:00]  end.  And then that's it.  Nothing.  I got nothing going on.  Oh, you got everything.  Pac Hooker's fired up.  Yeah.  I was only mad that you at least didn't get the thing that Stern.  Stern wound up on television.  Yeah, we don't.  And he's not a television kind of guy.  Yeah.  And if you recognize what's happening, they don't talk about that show anymore.  But America's got talent.  I'm telling you, the show's bullshit, because they say they're going to give away a million  dollars.  On the bottom, it says, in 40 years.  What?  Yeah, read the bottom.  And my buddy went out, and they said, you're going to Vegas. 
[02:51:30]  You're going to Vegas.  He went to Vegas.  19 hours in the fucking room.  They called him.  He went out.  There was no audience.  Three judges, and they said, we can't use you.  And he had to come back to New York.  That they don't tell you.  And Stern's a part of that shit, because Stern's going to get 50 million.  He don't give a fuck if the Nazi party walked in with helmets on.  And say, vive la Stern.  He'll come up and go, I'm going to the Hamptons.  The Hamptons.  I got to go to the Hamptons.  That's the shit.  Joy Behar.  Did you know I'm in the Hamptons? 
[02:52:00]  The Hamptons.  I said, you're lucky you're in a yard in Williamsburg, you sick fuck.  What the fuck is wrong with you, Joy?  You got lucky.  Oh, you know, she never comes out with the view and says, aye, and furthermore, and I'll  fuck, and I'll kill.  She don't.  She burps.  When she burps, they go, write another book.  Now, I know her when she was starting out.  And she wrote a book about the best friend she's ever had.  Who's that?  I look, show it.  No, I don't know who the fuck knows.  I don't know.  I'm looking for my name in the book.  I say, Pat, Pat, always help me.  Not a fucking thing. 
[02:52:30]  And don't want me on the show.  No.  She was forced.  When my book came out, she was forced.  Because she knows if it didn't put me on, I don't want to 42nd Street and yell her cock  off.  I said, because, you know.  And then, now she's got a new one.  She's on, I think, OP show.  Is that the OP?  The logo?  She's on a new thing.  I don't know what it is.  Oh, the Oprah.  Oprah.  Oh, yeah.  And they say, you know, say something to Joy Behar.  There's nothing you can say.  She has no fucking delivery.  She has no moho.  But she's sitting there knowing how lucky she got.  And she just, she don't know nobody. 
[02:53:00]  And when the view is over, she's got the little shmay dress show.  It's fucking over.  And here's the thing, with no talent, squeeze through the cracks.  Because she's got no talent.  And I tell her many times, I say, honey, you got away.  You know, I don't know shit.  I'm a fucking genius with people like you.  She must not like you.  Sam's got something.  Go ahead, Sam.  What's that now?  The America's Got Talent prize.  He's right.  What?  The prize for America's Got Talent?  The show that Howard's on.  You're right.  It's $25,000 a year.  $25,000 a year? 
[02:53:30]  For how many years?  What do you think?  I'm lying?  No.  Yes, you thought I was lying.  I believe you.  Kill.  He's the one that had to verify.  I don't lie.  You know something?  He's checking on you.  But look what they do.  These kids who, first of all, these kind of shows hurt children, young people.  They cry, and they don't know what to do.  They're being rejected.  Their mother rejects them.  Their father, they're a fucking asshole like him.  He goes, yeah, he's got talent.  Even the other guy.  What's the other guy's name?  Howie Mandel?  Howie Mandel. 
[02:54:00]  He said to this kid, and my grandkids, you will be the next superstar comedian.  Have you heard from this guy?  His wife hugged them on the television.  I'm so fucking happy.  Mother of Jesus.  I love Jesus.  I love God.  I love Hitler.  I love everybody.  I'm going to be on my fucking way.  Howie Mandel said it now.  Goes to show you about Howie Mandel's fucking brain.  He's collecting the $12,000,000,000 and don't contribute.  It's worth $375,000,000 after taxes, unless you take the lump sum, which is just under $200,000. 
[02:54:30]  $200,000.  The million dollar prize.  Million dollar prize.  It's got to be 40 years, I'm telling you.  Nobody fucking...  Throw that fucking thing away.  Okay.  Call me a fucking lawyer.  We got to throw a computer away, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I knew you'd stick up for it.  He's checking on you.  It's two hours late.  He's checking on you.  But Pat, he's a good judge, though, Howard.  Howard's a great judge.  He's the only thing he can judge.  He told the world he's America's judge.  No, I know what he's all about. 
[02:55:00]  Space.  He's trying to fill up space with other people's talent.  He's a fucking bully.  And he's got to know to be a man.  To be a man.  He can cop out now and show his children.  And say, listen, I'm a piece of shit.  But out of a piece of shit like me, I'm part of giving birth to you.  So at least I did something decent.  You're good daughters.  I'd rather have a son.  But you're good daughters.  But you know something?  And I hate to repeat. 
[02:55:30]  He's fucking dead.  He told Chevy Chase to go fuck himself.  And then he invites Chevy Chase to his fucking wedding.  You know, that goes to show you what the fuck kind of man he is.  Because he's scared.  He's a fucking pussy.  I don't mean to offend pussies.  Pussies are wonderful.  I don't mean that.  Like my buddy says, I don't want to marry her.  Why don't you want to marry her?  Oh, she's got cats, but you like her pussy.  Oh, that's all right, you fucking nipple.  You fucking stupid asshole.  How could you do that? 
[02:56:00]  If I loved her, I don't give a cash.  You got ten fucking tigers.  That has nothing to do with me.  But this fucking guy, he says, well.  And then she walked away.  And she went to Italy.  And I know why she went to meet Aldo.  Because there's a lot of Aldos in Italy.  And a couple of Ginos.  And they hit on you.  And I'm a fucking Italian.  He's hit on you.  It's fucking romantic.  I was hit and I went fucking nuts.  I walked over to him with a rancor.  He says, how are you, senora?  I said, what the fuck do you want?  He says, I want an action.  You want action with me? 
[02:56:30]  He says, things are tough in this country.  Anything that looks so good, he says.  So this is what you're, it's called talent.  I understand.  So that's what you're doing.  Yeah.  This guy don't live.  He's built himself a brick fucking wall.  And the worst time for it to happen, as he's getting older.  Because when you get older, he's going to find out alone.  And the dog didn't fucking die.  The dog committed suicide when he saw the fucking guy who was going to be in the same building.  The dog was a little puppy.  That's all he was.  A little puppy.  And Howard says, I don't give a fuck if the dog died. 
[02:57:00]  And the girl that goes with him never gets on television because she's bullied by him.  Why do you think she married him?  For love?  You know, it's like marrying a mop.  He's a fucking mop.  You turn him upside down, you can do the fucking bedroom.  The fucking guy is a walking mop.  Listen, Howard.  This is fucking war.  I took a rush because I had hernia trouble.  But I'm coming back.  And I'm going to go to the hand.  And I'm going to move next door to you.  The hand is the hand is the hand is. 
[02:57:30]  You had hernia trouble.  Fucking asshole.  Hernia trouble.  I'm going to be a guy.  Disgrace to humanity.  Why don't you give something back, you sick fuck?  Give something back.  Get a haircut.  Show life what it's all about.  Do it for your country.  Howard went bald for America.  Do something well with that fucking head.  You'll be good for Halloween.  Go bald today.  He don't even give candy to kids.  He wants them to give him candy.  Fucking think I don't know this fucking guy.  Full of shit.  And I'm so hurt because he was in a position to be a maven.  To be a wonderful fucking guy. 
[02:58:00]  To help young comics.  To give them hope and give them something.  You know, what the fuck?  So Sam Kennison.  This is when it really started.  I said, I hope Sam Kennison marries one of your daughters.  Oh, shit.  Well, you know.  And I said, remember, Sam Kennison was told by his girlfriend that he shits in bed.  Ah, yeah, sure, sure.  You know, I don't lie.  I said, so there you go.  He would have made them married, but he didn't want the, you know, he didn't want the guy  that's shitting his daughter's bed.  How about shitting your bed, Howard? 
[02:58:30]  Because he went for all the right, but he's talented.  Sam had his own flow.  Sam was funny.  Sam was talented.  But Sam stepped out of the fucking picture where he shouldn't have stepped out.  He should have stood being funny, but he went, well, what's, you know, you know, he was  taking whatever he was taking.  I think, this is only my opinion, when he was driving with the girl in the front, I think  he was getting a blowjob and they went off the fucking cliff.  I think so.  I think so.  I met him a few times.  He's wonderful.  And if he don't have that shit, he can't get a flow going. 
[02:59:00]  That's not what I mean.  But he's wearing his own style.  The other guy, the problem with the jackass, what's his name?  Dice, Andrew Dice.  Dice, you want to be Italian.  He wouldn't give anything to be Italian.  See, that's why he wouldn't take the jacket off.  He don't know your mama.  He was going.  He's a Jew.  Be happy to be a Jew.  For Christ's sakes.  Jews are wonderful.  Trust me.  Well, his whole persona was a tough guy and it's hard to find a tough guy Jew.  You know.  The last tough guy Jew was Einstein.  You think Einstein?  Yeah, you're fucking right.  Did you read his life story? 
[02:59:30]  He sat down there.  You know, people do crossword puzzles.  He invented a bomb.  What the fuck else can you do when you're 12, 13 years old?  His mother wanted to play piano.  He had a fuck and he blew the piano up.  Yeah.  You see?  It's cool.  It's wonderful.  Anyway, that's the fact.  I thought that other guy, the Jewish mobster was the last.  Mayer Lansky.  Mayer Lansky.  I thought he was.  Mayer Lansky was Nazi.  Mayer Lansky was actually the waiter of the gangsters.  He served them what he wanted. 
[03:00:00]  Very brilliant.  He died in bed.  Yeah.  You know, that's the fucking.  Tanya said, I'm a fucking motherfucker, motherfucker.  See, Tanya's turned around and they were selling anything.  Yeah.  And when my father says, you put something in your arm, I'll break your fucking arm.  Oh.  So I said, but I want to get high.  He says, use oregano.  So I used oregano in my fucking nose and I was playing Italian records for two months.  But that's okay.  Yeah.  We could not do that in our family.  First of all, we couldn't afford a loaf of bread.  What the fuck?  We're going to buy cocoa babania.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:00:30]  These kids are looking for a way out.  The way out is to stand up for guys like Howard Stern to make a name.  Get a six-year-old and call Howard Stern a motherfucker.  That's right.  I'm going to get a lot of six-year-olds and go, you're a bully.  You're a fucking bully, Mr. Stern.  Don't say Mr. Stern.  They don't think it's a joke.  Mr. Stern, you cock-dogging you.  That's what you are.  Are they retarded?  Six years old.  Eight years old.  Attack this fucking bum.  Because he's got to understand that this ain't going to save them.  I got news here.  I heard rumors.  I don't know. 
[03:01:00]  It's true.  People are starting to move out.  Yeah?  They don't want to go in the ocean.  It's going the other way.  Why is that?  You hear me?  The ocean's going the other fucking way.  Yeah, it is.  People got to swim.  They got to go three miles out.  Oh, really?  Obama's killed the whole area.  You're not going to do my show anymore.  I don't want to make my fucking show.  I said, you did me a favor, you fucking idiot.  If I go on brown, I said, I'm bigger than you.  People said, I got a heart.  I give to people.  I pick up a check once in a while.  You're a cheap fuck.  You're a cheap fuck.  Is he cheap?  But you're going 90 million, 100 million, 300 million. 
[03:01:30]  Shove it up your ass.  I hope you can't fart for two days.  And hope your fucking belly gets stunked.  That's what you were telling all these kids all the way when you were the big Howard.  You're down to three words.  Three days, you're down there.  Then it's going to be two days.  Then one day.  Then they're going to turn around, put you on a street corner, say, hi, I'm the real Howard  Stern.  Nobody will believe it.  Because you've been dead for all these fucking years.  You have no fucking life.  And I'm going to tell you, here's another one.  David Steinberg, you piece of shit.  Oh.  You ought to be ashamed.  Turn me down, him and his wife. 
[03:02:00]  Turn me down to do his show.  You no-talent fuck.  David Steinberg?  How dare you turn down a genius, you fuck.  You would turn down Einstein, you sick bastard.  And let me tell you, I get turned down only when I want to get turned down.  Yeah.  This is my fucking life.  And let me tell you, mister, whatever your fucking talent is, he's out with the New York  Comedy Club, whatever that is.  He's talking to, what's his name?  Um, uh, uh, uh, fuckers.  Uh, um.  You know, anyway, the guy that was on, uh, that makes movies, you know, he was in, uh, 
[03:02:30]  uh, anyway.  Is he black or white?  There's no subject, we're all black.  What?  A lot of us just won't admit that we're white.  Holy shit.  Anyway, you know who I'm talking about.  Robin Williams.  Oh.  Oh, no, no.  Joe, if you want to see Robin Williams, not David Steinberg.  Who the fuck wants to see David Steinberg?  I want to see a fucking, I want to see a sandwich that is collie.  That's what I want to see.  That's a disease.  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I said to him, I told my friend, Steve, I said, Steve, I don't mind turning me down.  Jay Leno turned me down. 
[03:03:00]  I said, fuck him.  How fucking daddy.  Jay Leno is a stand-up comic that sits behind a desk.  No disrespect.  Fine.  I say, what's his name?  Letterman is a better sit-down man interviewing people.  Now you got Kimmel coming in.  Now you got another guy coming in.  Pretty soon, everybody's going to have a talk show and no audience.  Because no one's saying anything on these shows that you can point out and say, did you hear that?  Did you see that?  Did you believe what he said?  Did you see that?  Say, this is why Steinberg, this piece of shit, to turn me down. 
[03:03:30]  Who the fuck are you?  Who the fuck are you, you piece of shit?  You and that lady are married.  You want to interview me?  Sure, anybody can interview Robin Williams or Sid Caesar.  Sure, why don't you introduce me that I got things to say?  I mean, with all due respect to Sid Caesar, he's wonderful.  He's going to say, well, you know, when I did Saturday night and I did that, let's talk about when he masturbated.  That's interesting.  Sid Caesar.  When did Sid Caesar masturbate?  Well, I never told you would hate him.  He's human, you sick fuck. 
[03:04:00]  But he wants to show that he belongs with that crew.  Mr. Seidenberg or whatever your fucking name is.  David Steinberg.  I'm old, that's 80 years old talking.  You ought to be ashamed.  I demand an apology if I don't.  I'm going to come and get you on a radio show for 24 hours and break your balls.  Because you've got to prove to me that you understand a flow of comedy.  You've got to understand an orchestration of comedy.  You've got to understand you're not bored with it.  You hear me?  You don't have the flow.  You don't have the understanding. 
[03:04:30]  Anybody can talk to all these fucking stars.  And fight them all, Bob.  And fight them all, Sal.  And fight them all.  Yes, I agree with you.  Of course I do.  And the wife goes, we love you, Sid Caesar.  We'll always love you.  Fuck you.  Sid Caesar's still alive.  Yes.  I didn't know that.  They just did his 29th birthday.  I mean, his birthday.  Really?  No, his 90th birthday.  90.  I sent him a message.  I said, Sid Caesar, die.  And people said, well, it's humor, you sick fuck.  Of course.  It's humor.  Jeff Don Riggle said it.  Oh, he said, Jesus. 
[03:05:00]  I said, you ought to be ashamed.  You're anti-Jewish.  I ain't anti-cock.  I got Italians I can't fucking stand.  I got Italians I did weddings and never paid me.  What about these motherfuckers?  But I couldn't say nothing.  They carried guns.  They carried guns.  What happened?  Sid doesn't look too good.  He's 90.  It looks like he should be looking through a screen door, huh?  Wow.  Yeah.  How old are you, Pat?  How old are you?  I just made 83.  83?  Yeah.  Well, if I say three, I don't come from Brooklyn no more.  Well, that's true.  This is a classic George Burns. 
[03:05:30]  And you know what I try to tell people?  The Jewish culture has the DNA of being funny.  Because when I grew up, they were all Jews.  And they were wonderful.  They had a rhythm.  Today, with no disrespect to nothing, I don't mean, you know me better than that.  I don't see a rhythm.  I don't see a feeling, a rhythm.  Now, the other guy, what's his name?  Louie Black.  I love Louie Black.  But Louie Black works, with all due respect, I saw him the other night.  He works like he's going to have a nervous breakdown.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was born with that.  When I come out of my mother's vagina, the doctor said, no, no, he's going to come in about half an hour. 
[03:06:00]  That's a nervous breakdown.  So my nervous breakdown came up first.  And what happened was a curse to my father.  Because you're not supposed to talk at a turn.  You've got to shut up.  You've got to get a job as soon as you can walk.  I don't give a fuck what.  Get a job.  I was 11 years old, so when are you going to get your own place?  You understand?  Today, that's called child abuse.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's it.  I know.  You just pick the water.  Yeah, you want water?  The water demands some water.  I'm coming here.  A woman in this delicatessen buys Evian, which is like a buck 87. 
[03:06:30]  She pours the Evian in a container that says pure water.  Now, you're fucking going to tell me.  You went for Avian for $1.90 or whatever, and you carry a fucking thing that's going  to purify fucking Evian?  You're a motherfucker.  You know what?  I hate to say it.  I'm going to tell you.  That's what they mean when they say you're a cunt.  That's what it fucking means.  But they don't understand.  What do you do?  How many containers can you carry?  You'll be carrying them on your cock.  Why filter?  Why filter bottled water? 
[03:07:00]  Because you're sick.  People, why are they texting?  You know what I do?  Why?  I got nothing to do all day long.  I look for people who are texting, and I stand there and hope they walk in front of  me.  I hope they walk in front of me.  And then I go texting, texting, texting.  All around the corner, texting.  I go.  I walk around them.  Texting, texting.  You don't text.  There's no reason.  You don't text.  I bought a thing for $300.  I leave it in the fucking drawer.  It's a fucking boring.  All I hear is like, fuck it.  I don't give a fuck if they're telling me it's a fucking earthquake. 
[03:07:30]  Fuck it.  I wasted my time.  That little thing called a telephone, mother of Christ.  A telephone.  Hello?  Goodbye.  That's all.  That was life.  You don't fill in this shit.  Right, right, right.  Now they got a smaller one.  Next thing I have one on your buckle.  You can talk to your fucking buckle.  Sure.  They got a television on your buckle.  Then they got a television on your balls, just in case you missed something.  In case you want to photograph yourself coming.  They got that.  See, that's why you're boring.  You don't do a fucking thing.  If they took this job, you're the next suicide.  But Pat, a lot of people these days, a lot of people, a lot of people, you know, texting 
[03:08:00]  and using their phones these days, you know, it's just.  Well, I think I.  You got to think.  I don't think.  I just throw it right at you.  You know why?  Why?  It's their fucking toy.  They're fucking lonely.  Now they know what?  The dog's got his own texting.  The fucking dog is texting with his tongue.  What the fuck is your dog doing?  What is your dog doing?  He's texting.  Why is he texting?  He loves me.  Fuck you and your dog.  I hope your dog gets a heart attack. 
[03:08:30]  He had a heart attack.  What happened?  Open heart surgery.  What did it cost you?  A hundred grand.  Let him fucking die for $30.  I love dogs too, but give me a fucking break.  I mean, now they want to shit on the fucking street and they leave it there.  They say, that's my dog.  He don't shit any place.  That's the fucking attitude.  And we're turning around saying, what is going on in this fucking country?  I'll tell you what's going on.  We better turn around.  We better turn around and say, our children who want to go to college will never pay a dime. 
[03:09:00]  Our country's going to pay for these kids because these kids are doing things because they're up against the wall.  I think of my friend's kids here, that little blonde little kid.  I think of him on a horse, you know, being a clown.  I saw, I said, Jesus, I hope he's got two.  Then I saw the wife.  I go, thank God.  I know I can't come from him altogether.  No, no, of course.  But she's a, can I touch him?  She's a doll.  Oh, sure, sure.  And you know, you know, you know, she's unhappy.  He says, what am I going to do?  He makes nice kids.  And he was so nice, he recognized me because, you know, I'm old. 
[03:09:30]  And he, when he had the baby on his chest and the baby was breathing heavy and he goes, no, that's just got colic.  The baby ain't got colic?  Can't breathe with that fucking thing around his mouth.  I said, you went to a kid fight to Zorro?  The fuck is this?  The kid was sunk in the basket.  The kid's fucking legs were hanging.  Then he wonders why he's got balls problems.  Because the balls are hitting the basket that he's got around his fucking neck.  How else am I supposed to carry the kid around?  I agree.  It's a beautiful watch.  83 years old, Pat Cooper. 
[03:10:00]  I want to promote your gig, Pat.  Forget it, I quit.  No.  Brigada Comedy Club presents Pat Cooper, October 26th.  Friday.  Friday at the Brigada.  I got the Brigada Friday night.  Who the fuck wouldn't go see Pat?  I've never seen it.  They're punishing me.  We have to see if you're going to get by on a Friday.  If you do good, you're going to be on a Tuesday in the Yucatan.  I want to quit.  I really want to quit.  No.  No, I really want to quit.  What the hell are you going to do then?  Me?  Die. 
[03:10:30]  If you quit.  Be me.  Oh, Jesus.  You are you.  No, I'm not me yet.  I'll let you know.  Who are you?  When I leave the doors open that night and I'm sleeping, then I arrived.  Because I don't fear nothing.  You understand?  No.  I got a roach came to my fucking house.  I could have killed it.  I explained to him, you don't belong here.  What the fuck are you doing here?  Go back in the pipe, you stupid bastard.  Wait, I'll give you.  I got some bread.  I gave him bread.  See, if you feed these motherfuckers, they'll never come to your house.  When they say we got rat problems in the subways, give them a sandwich. 
[03:11:00]  Have a place.  Rat sandwiches here.  Put it there.  They go in a box to eat.  They ring a bell and come out.  What the fuck are we turning?  We're throwing things in the fucking tracks.  I'm a fucking genius.  Feed these motherfuckers.  And feed them by the ocean.  And then have a plow.  Pull them into the fucking water.  And you know, yeah.  Then they'll join the Olympics and they'll be one of those guys that go up with the waves.  This is what you think about when you're not.  See, this is what you'd think about if you weren't doing a comedy.  You're talking to insects, for God's sake.  I'm having trouble remembering some of the things that I used to say. 
[03:11:30]  And in a way, it's good because I don't like to repeat.  I've changed my shit a lot.  And when I was doing my regular shit, everybody, and when I went on, what's his name, in 1980,  Tom Snyder, they all thought I wrote my career.  That's when I found who I was.  I said, now that's what you've been holding in.  Fuck them.  Go out there and do what you got to say.  What's on your mind?  Be different than any comic.  Don't try to be funny.  Be different.  Because when you're different, the people are going to come. 
[03:12:00]  Those who hate you will come to see you.  And I did that, and I'm still around.  I'm doing business wherever I go.  Sure.  And they say, Pat, you know something?  What are you going to do when you quit?  I says, well, I go to Florida.  I got friends down there and hang out.  I said, I don't know.  I got no women in my life.  Who the fuck wants to live with me?  I drive them fucking crazy.  I got a woman, a 70-year-old woman.  Send me a picture of her when she was 18.  I said, if you look like that, I'd fuck the picture.  I'm fucking old. 
[03:12:30]  I got erection of dysfunction on my tongue.  She goes, on your tongue?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You have to look and tell it to you.  That's Pat Cooper, 1981.  81 on Tom Snyder.  I'm telling you, Tom Snyder kept asking me, do you know what you're saying?  Of course I know what the fuck I'm saying.  Everybody wanted to fucking kill me.  But you know something?  I raised my price.  Yeah, yeah.  Because people say, I want that guy that was on Tom Snyder.  I want him to come over here.  I was working Utah.  Nobody works in Utah.  Tom Snyder was big back then.  Yeah, he would get all the good interviews back then. 
[03:13:00]  He was one of the best after Carson.  But then something happens when it starts to tire her out.  They can't handle it.  They say, I can handle, you know, I can handle defeat.  Because I was born a defeatist.  My father says, you know, you're a defeat.  And he always shook his head when he talked.  That's why we never serve him soup.  It's true.  We never serve them soup.  It's called fucking humor.  Humor.  This is what you can tell.  See these kind of shows? 
[03:13:30]  You can repeat this for the fucking next million years.  Oh, we will.  Nobody comes on this show like you.  No, no, no.  I'm giving myself accolades because within my shit, I'm saying things.  I feel bad for you, Anthony.  I do too, Pat.  I mean, him, I gotta feel bad.  He's got kids.  Sure.  You should give him half of your salary.  What the fuck have you put on this rate?  No, I can't.  I need my money.  He's got no spring count.  No, he doesn't.  He just comes in, he mails it in, and he goes home.  Who?  He mails it in, and he goes home.  That's what I do.  Well, you know what?  That's okay. 
[03:14:00]  Put in my time.  You can handle adversity if you can spell it.  Ah, I can't.  There you go.  See, he's got people go home.  See, the wife will put the two kids by the door.  Say hello to daddy, but the guy can't say because she's in a basket.  I know.  I love it because I never saw the guy who knows lies.  He goes, that's my other one.  I went, oh, Jesus, what a great looking kid.  And the kid kept sinking, you know what I'm saying?  He was hiding.  He was hiding from you.  He was sinking in the basket.  Hey, stop.  That's the last.  What happened?  I don't want no more kids from you. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, no more kids.  All right.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  I see Pat all the time.  I'm telling you.  Can we watch this from 81?  I want to hear a little Pat Cooper from 81.  Yeah.  I hear what you're talking about back then.  What are you doing, Sam?  Do you hear it?  Yeah.  There it is.  Are you on any television at all?  No.  No.  We hear it, though.  It's not.  And why Pat Cooper seems to be very, very unhappy about the way things are going.  No, I know.  You just need the headphones.  I don't want to hear it.  Oh, you don't want to hear it?  Impressions of a comic. 
[03:15:00]  Pat Cooper is a gentleman that...  Horrible production.  Terrible production value.  I don't remember.  I was 12.  This is too much.  We'll do it another day.  Who wants to hear that shit?  Yeah, we'll do it another day.  Fuck him.  Because Pat can't hear it.  Fuck Tom Schneider.  Look at you.  Boy, you didn't look like...  It looks like you ate a few more sandwiches back then than these days.  No, I was like this.  A little more pasta back then?  No, I got it here. 
[03:15:30]  Really?  Because your face is a little chubby.  Look at that fucking head.  Yes, you know why?  Because you have a fat set.  No, he's telling them, you know what I'm saying?  Sure.  Oh, you're a slender.  Look at you.  Look at how tall I am.  Look at this.  A good looking guy.  Look how I control my fucking anger.  Look at the venom coming across the seat.  The venom.  In the center, I got to work.  There's all these stands around.  Oh.  And I say, can you move the...  That's a night that's going to be played when the fucking Russians come here.  I'm the boss.  Yes, they're going to come here.  They want to see all the great comedians. 
[03:16:00]  I'm telling you now, please do me a favor to move it.  No.  I offer a thousand dollars to manage you to build me a platform.  Look how I control it.  I want to hear this.  You're very well in control.  You notice I keep going with my mouth.  Yeah, what happened?  I learned that from Gumsmoke.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the stone who played the doctor.  Every two fucking energies were in his face.  Look at you.  How do I sound, all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Would you be my friend after that?  100%.  With that hair, you'd be anybody's fucking friend.  Uh-huh.  God bless you. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, look at you with your salt and pepper hair do.  You got your salt and pepper hair do.  ...as to who they want to open for them.  Yeah, but tell me why you don't want me.  Okay, then if they would say to you, hey, listen.  You're like a tough guy.  You look like a fucking mafioso over here.  That's the best I've ever heard anybody tell me that.  You fucking do, too.  You look like a tough guy.  I'm not a tough guy.  I know how to talk.  I know what you're like.  No, you look like a tough guy.  You look like a tough guy, you balls.  Back then.  I know tough guys.  You know where they are?  In fucking jail.  Yeah.  I'm a tough guy.  I stood out. 
[03:17:00]  So that makes me the smart guy.  I still eat fucking macaroni on Sunday.  How does that fucking grab you?  I know a guy like you, if they took a macaroni, you'll kill yourself.  That's all we're worried is macaroni.  Never pasta, only gays eat pasta.  I don't like pasta.  That's it.  Man, you look like a hitman.  He does, right?  He does.  Look at the confidence.  Inside, my balls are fucking moving.  Go get him, Cooper.  Go get him.  And find him, oh, your honor.  And I'll say this about her.  She's full of shit from an old movie. 
[03:17:30]  It does.  It looks like you're testifying in front of Congress.  In front of Congress.  I demand everybody gets nothing.  Fuck them all.  Interns get paid.  Fuck them all.  Interns, Sam.  You're an intern.  Not enough.  Not enough.  Not enough.  Very low pay.  Low salary.  We should have a cup in the morning.  Oh, shit.  I want to hear this so bad.  I'll definitely watch it.  I'm going to go home and watch this.  That's good.  I'm going to go home and watch that.  That will be shown when I'm dead.  Not because of anything. 
[03:18:00]  Because no one said that.  No.  Now they say it.  They're all.  Also, they say, well, perhaps.  What did you say?  We can't hear.  What did you say?  Of course, it's not that important to you.  You're not that right.  I would love to hear it.  You never heard it?  No.  You're not a computer.  Yeah.  Once you're playing on YouTube and you're hollering with your girlfriend instead of banging her.  Am I funny?  You've got a hair that kills.  I love you.  Honey, your hair is just gone.  And I'm not trying to.  My wife got a lover.  I lost her.  But she always had different hairstyles. 
[03:18:30]  And that you're going to be.  Get rid of it.  Understand what I'm saying?  Listen to me.  Let me do your laundry.  What?  Why do you want to do a laundry, Pat?  Is she living with you?  What?  No.  No.  No.  You'll move here.  I'll give you your own.  I'll let me buy your house.  Fuck them.  What is this?  What did you just do?  Oh, so I can hear you.  I was straightened up.  Don't ever do that.  I didn't mean to.  Don't ever do that.  Don't ever do that.  Oh, boy.  The Trump announcement's at 12.  Get off the fucking door.  Trump announcement's at 12. 
[03:19:00]  He's going to announce some about Obama.  Saying everyone's predictions are wrong.  All the predictions are wrong.  Who's that?  What?  Eastwood.  Oh, they were just showing Clint Eastwood up.  That's a repeat.  He's the smartest guy.  He did the smartest.  At least we got some fucking humor out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody was kind of laughing.  You see what he should have done, Obama, on the first fucking thing?  Come up with a chair and sit down.  I'm waiting for you, Clint.  Oh.  But they got no balls.  No, no.  The politicians...  They're afraid of saying something.  They both are bullshitting. 
[03:19:30]  We need a guy there who's blind, has a dog, and runs this country better.  Because that's common sense.  Why you got a dog so I can find out where I'm going?  These fucking guys need 20 dogs and don't know where the fuck they're going.  You don't have any choice in this election?  I have a choice.  Who do you want?  I don't have to do the show no more.  Fuck you.  I'm going to get back in stone and protect your shit.  When he told you you can't say this, you can't say that.  I'd have turned around and said, you better stab me, you fuck.  I'm coming to your studio.  Do you think you'll ever be on his show again? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, yes.  Really?  Oh, yes.  What?  He's going to have to call me because he's getting my email and they're saying, you know,  if he's so full of shit, why don't you put him out, tell him to his face.  And then I want him to play the tapes that he spied on everybody.  That's why his wife probably divorced him when they were sleeping.  She was hearing, and then he turned around and said, I'm getting out of here.  Like, you really think he was having people tape you instead of just maybe some...  I should never, never have any luck.  He has people walk in the streets and call him. 
[03:20:30]  They're not working for him as interns, but somebody say, Howard, I just heard Pat Cooper.  He called you a bitch and said, what, da, da, da, da, da, bring him on the show.  And whenever he tried to put me down, I didn't give a fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He said, did you say that?  Of course I said, you got a tape, you sick fuck.  The fuck, you stupid.  I said, you know, and he has, you know what he does?  He opens up a lot of girls, you know, with the sex shit, but not a man to stand by them.  Not a man to help them.  And not a man to say, well, you know, well, you're a nice piece of it.  That's not what it's about. 
[03:21:00]  No.  I know girls who showed their tits were brilliant.  They had nipples that crossbreed, which has never been seen before.  That's the first time they saw it was in the Yucatan.  Yeah.  I'm sad.  Yeah, with badges.  You know these animal badges?  Their tits, they're divisible.  I'm serious.  I didn't know that.  Well, you got to look at National Geographic.  That's where you learn about humping, the true way of humping.  When you can get a monkey who's going into spine country that is hitting their spine, they  get an erection.  And sometimes the boy, the girl monkey, thinks it's his pecker. 
[03:21:30]  It's his spine.  You understand?  You don't understand.  I don't know.  I learn more on the animal planet because I find out that's us.  They don't go to the heaps.  They go to a higher tree.  I don't.  I wish I didn't have a sense of humor.  All right.  We finish with this shit.  All right.  I guess we're finished with this shit.  Pat fucking Cooper.  The Brigada Comedy Club presents Pat Cooper October 26th.  That's Friday.  It's Friday.  Holy fuck.  Who's not going to see Pat Cooper? 
[03:22:00]  Can I tell you something?  Yeah.  I'm hoping that if whoever shows up, because it could be the end of my career.  That's it, huh?  This might have hurt me when I did today.  I was very nice.  You know, I was going to take up a novena for something.  But, you know, when you're born a dog, can't die a cat.  I never change.  I am what I am.  And you're not going to make everybody happy.  If I was on this show, no disrespect, once a fucking day, you'd be the biggest thing in the country.  He's holding it back.  He still thinks that picture he took is worth something.  It ain't worth shit.  Which picture?  Tell the truth. 
[03:22:30]  What picture is he referring to?  Talking about pussy don't mean nothing anymore.  There's a guy from Australia not talking about what comes out of your body.  You fucking believe this?  And he's doing thousands of guys.  What's it, Jim Johnson?  Jim Jeffries.  You had to correct me.  It's kind of like I had to correct me.  But you know something?  And I don't think he's funny because it's bothering me with his material.  Why do we got to talk about somebody taking a shit?  That's not funny to me.  I think what's funny is when you don't need all of that. 
[03:23:00]  We need the way you talk.  Like I told you, I saw a black here tonight.  You know, he's so, I'm afraid he's going to get a fucking heart attack.  But his material, when he says fucking cock, blends into what he's talking about like you.  You blend in.  Well, I'm talking about pussy.  I get everybody horny.  And then I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  You still doing that?  Oh, yeah.  Big pussy.  You're talking about eating pussy?  No, no, no, no.  Do you know why men eat pussy?  Why?  They want to go home.  Think about that, right?  I have to think about that. 
[03:23:30]  I know, Francis.  I can't eat pussy.  Why?  He's too close to the ass.  I said, what the fuck you want me to do?  Put a piece of cardboard there.  God love you.  And he just vlogs out.  Pat Cooper, everyone.  Bregada Comedy Club.  Pat Cooper.  This Friday, the Bregada.com for tickets.  Hey, listen to me.  Take care of those kids.  I try.  You need a few dollars, you know I live.  All right, I try.  I do know where you live.  Tell your wife I sit on the phone.  We're almost neighbors.  All right, there, Pat.  Pat Cooper.  You've got to get more money.  There we go.  We can all leave together.  I have to play.  Yeah, Jim Norton plays.  Jimmy. 
[03:24:00]  Are you married?  Yeah.  Oh, wait, please.  Five years.  No, no, no.  I'm showing you my ring face.  No, I've only been married for a few months.  Yes, she is.  Now, if you get another hundred, we'll go 50 apiece.  You've got kids.  You'll go just 25 and give 75.  Oh, thank you.  What is this?  What are you, Obama trying to take my money and pass it on other people?  Love you, Pat.  You know that.  Bye, buddy.  Take it easy, Pat.  I'll see you on the streets.  Have a good one, Pat Cooper.  Fuck you, Roland.  There he goes.  Fuck you, Roland.  83.  When I see him in the neighborhood, I can't even catch up to him just to say hi. 
[03:24:30]  Look at him.  He walks so fucking fast.  He's like, you're so good.  You're so gorgeous.  Let me take it to Italy for about a couple of weeks.  He's going to take it to Italy.  How long are you going with this guy?  We're just friends.  He doesn't know.  He's Pat.  We're just friends.  He doesn't know.  Love is no more.  Now he's singing to her.  You're playing hard to get.  Well, he's not Cary Grant.  He says, that's Grant.  Hey, he says you're just friends.  We are just friends.  You've got to straighten this shit out. 
[03:25:00]  I've got two places.  I've got to play some fire with it.  He's trying to play.  I'm moving.  I'm going to break his walls.  Okay.  God bless, bud.  Bye, Pat.  Take it easy, Pat.  Where's your guy?  Roland.  Where's your Jew?  That's Steve.  Where's Steve?  Yeah, there he is.  Yo, Steve.  There he goes.  He did good today.  He did good.  Yeah, you guys kicked me out, but that's okay.  I didn't kick you out.  Who kicked you out?  I'm married.  I wouldn't have hit on you. 
[03:25:30]  Go guide him before he walks off.  I got to do it.  See you, buddy.  I'm going to get that one.  Tomorrow through Sunday, I will be in Philadelphia at the Helium Comedy Club.  All shows are sold out except for the late show tomorrow, which is almost sold out.  And there's tickets available on Sunday.  And New Year's Eve, December 28th through 31.  I'm in Buffalo at the Helium Comedy Club.  Nice.  He's talking through the double glass.  He's out of his mind.  He's trying to talk to us through the double glass.  Open the door for him.  Open the door.  Pat, what happened? 
[03:26:00]  He's going to give Camille a book.  I only gifted a girl.  I'm just stuck.  I can't.  God bless you.  All right, Pat.  All right.  Steve, later.  There you go, Steve.  Holy shit.  He's 83.  That's amazing.  Jesus Christ.  That's amazing.  I know.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  I'm fucking exhausted.  Like I said, when I see him on the streets, I can't even keep up with him to even just  say hi.  Oh, do I need to walk so fast now?  All right.  All right.  I guess that's it for today. 
[03:26:30]  Had it.  We all need a nap.  All right.  Stay tuned for the show.  Am Roberts show.  Okay.  All right.  Am Roberts show.  You know, the show that used to be the post-game for the Opie and Anthony show?  Take my hair.  You put some animal glue in it.  Then print M-80s and blow it up.  Because I want the hair to look like a samurai. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, Chipster.  Chip.  I would say, you should make a hair like a bunch of straw or something.  Asian chip.  We have our hair doing like a sketch hole.  That's easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, you got it down.  Totally.  That's fucking easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got you, Chip.  Don't worry.  It was good.  Yeah.  Trump's prediction at noon, huh? 
[03:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  And he said all predictions were wrong.  So he said, so it's not about a divorce.  Well, that was the big one.  And he's saying everyone's been wrong.  So it's totally incorrect.  Now it really gets incorrect.  He's got everyone talking about it.  He does.  That's what he does.  He learned well from Pat Cooper.  That's what he does.  That's what he does.  He's got no dignity.  Fuck him.  He's just, why are you fucking messing with the Nazis? 
[03:28:00]  I'm still confused about how he feels about Howard Stern.  You're a sick fuck.  You're a sick fuck.  That's talent.  Talent.  That's humor.  I think he was holding back a little bit.  A little bit.  Holy shit.  All right.  Now I've got to put my coat on, so I've got to take my headphones off, so I can't do  any more.  Bye, guys.  Later.  Serious XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live. 
[03:28:30]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Have we all had a nice rest?  Is everybody sufficiently rested and toned down a little bit?  Boy, oh boy.  Pat Cooper.  Well, like I said on the air, I still want to know what he thinks about Howard Stern. 
[03:29:00]  It was amazing the roads that Pat Cooper would take today on the show to lead him right back  down the Howard Stern path.  He had a lot to say about him.  He went in, I mean, the first time, he used to come in here and he would just talk about  his father and how he had shits that didn't smell bad.  But now it's all Howard.  I don't know what, if there's something, because it sounded like, the stories that Pat Cooper  was telling on the air today, it sounded like, you know, his beef with Howard Stern is old.  Like, it sounded like these are arguments that he and Howard had had years ago, but he 
[03:29:30]  comes in today and he's acting like this is a fresh thing.  Like, you know, the world's talking about Pat Cooper versus Howard Stern.  I just don't know.  Call us up.  866-WOW1-WOW-866-969-1969.  It's after Open Anthony Live.  I think we have some prizes today.  Like, uh, is this signed?  Let me see.  Yes.  It's like a signed copy of D.L.  Hughley's book.  A bunch of stuff.  But don't just call up and say, I want a prize.  Because if you just call up and be like, oh, can I have something? 
[03:30:00]  I'll be like, no, you may not.  No, you cannot have anything at all.  You can have your phone hung up on right now.  Now, I want you to come up.  You know, you just heard a man entertain you for an hour.  And there was an 83-year-old man.  You just heard Pat Cooper just come in and set the place on fire.  He burned this motherfucker down.  And we didn't even need to.  I mean, ONA and Jim, everybody said it before he came in.  They said, you know, we're going to be able to punch out around 9 today.  We're going to be sitting in the studio, but we're going to be able to put our feet up. 
[03:30:30]  And that's what happened.  I don't think that there was more than three technical questions asked of Pat Cooper during that entire segment.  I guess that's nothing new, but I think three is the most questions that I will say were asked.  Beyond that, it was just him coming in here and just deciding where to go.  We'll go to Snowy in Michigan.  Snowy in Michigan.  What's up, buddy?  How are you doing today, sir?  Good. 
[03:31:00]  Well, apparently I learned today that according to Pat Cooper, Howard Stern has something about the Hamptons, the Hamptons, the Hamptons.  Apparently, this is where Howard Stern goes sometimes, the Hamptons.  I had no idea, but Pat Cooper, this is a point of contention for him.  I don't know if he, I mean, I don't know if he objects just strictly to people vacationing in the Hamptons area of Long Island or if it's Howard's house specifically.  But a lot of what makes Howard Stern, Howard Stern bothers Pat Cooper.  I had no idea. 
[03:31:30]  Sal, did you learn anything on today's show?  Wait, wait, wait, sorry.  I actually didn't do that on purpose.  Oh, that's okay.  But it's not like it's something I wouldn't do.  I know you don't like to do things later in the show, but Chip does an awesome Asian impression.  That was the end.  I didn't think so.  I didn't think it was very good at all.  Oh, I thought it was hysterical.  Yeah, no, I didn't think so at all.  What did you think, Greg?  I felt like I got hit by a truck or something. 
[03:32:00]  It was absolutely exhausting, but it's one of those things where it's like I wanted to turn the radio off for just a little bit to take a break, but you just can't.  You got to keep listening because you never know what's going to come out of his mouth.  You know it's amazing when somebody who's that age can come in here and even make a listener through a radio feel exhausted.  You know what I mean?  Like an 83-year-old man comes in and he goes, Roland.  Yeah.  Roland is the hero of the day. 
[03:32:30]  Roland's a guy.  I see Pat before he comes in.  Is Pat, does he roll into this building like a ball of fire?  Screaming at the security guard.  Where's the fucking Mets again?  He goes, Beiner, come here.  Sign me in.  I would love to talk to Opie because Opie was saying that Pat Cooper and him, you know, talked on the street.  I would love to see if their interaction on the sidewalk just in the city was, was Pat Cooper still being Pat Cooper? 
[03:33:00]  Because you're saying he is like before he gets on the air.  Oh, yeah.  I mean in the office he's firing off about Howard, about this, about that.  Yeah, I heard in my headphones that apparently he was cursing out Jim Norton's poster in the office before he came on the show.  He goes, what the fuck?  That's, he's Joey Bishop.  That, that guy, we're friends.  And then he's telling me.  Joey Bishop?  He's telling me Joey Bishop stories.  Then he looked at the poster and started screaming at the poster.  Why is he talking about Joey Bishop?  I don't know. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, because he's talking about Regis.  He goes, Regis is a, he's a classy guy.  Okay.  And then he talked about how Joe DiMaggio is a cheap fuck.  Joe DiMaggio?  Yeah, he goes, I.  Does he not have any stories that took place beyond the 1960s?  He goes, I went to the Copacabana.  He goes, me, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio.  Guess what?  All cheap fucks.  All.  I was like, all right, all right.  Can he pick up the newspaper?  And then he hit me with the newspaper. 
[03:34:00]  He goes, A-Rod, a cheap fuck.  He is a walking historical document.  He is, he's a blast from the past.  Yeah, he wants to put his foot up in Ron's ass.  He will not let go of an era that doesn't even come close to existing anymore.  Like, we can't even relate to the era he's coming from.  Yeah, he made fun of Sal and the intern.  He goes, oh my God, these, these are the youth of America.  Did he make fun of you, Sal?  He gives like a typical, like Italian old guy answer, like why I didn't shave, you know?  Right.  And I say he's a hipster.  He goes, he doesn't fucking shower.  Sal, you're, you're an Italian, okay? 
[03:34:30]  You're an Italian guy.  Yes.  Have you heard the phrase Encelade used for sex?  Encelade, yeah.  He was saying Encelade.  Because he's, he's very American.  What's American?  Like he's, he's like Americanized Italian.  He is.  He's putting it on a little bit?  Well, no, not that he's putting it on.  It's just like someone who doesn't have like, like who doesn't have that linguistics behind them.  They would say something like that.  So how do you get the linguistics behind you?  Uh, my mom, her first language is Italian. 
[03:35:00]  She's off the boat.  She's not off the boat.  Her parents are.  So where was she born?  She was born in Brooklyn.  So her first language is English.  No, she went to school.  They, they thought she was like retarded when she went to kindergarten, actually.  Because she didn't speak English?  Because she didn't speak English, yeah.  So your grandparents then are off the boat Italian?  Yeah.  Like if you want to call him, he, my, my Nanu, my grandfather sounds.  Nanu?  Yeah, Nanu.  Is that an Italian name or is that like Mork from Orc?  Nanu, Nanu.  No, that's, that's my, you know, grandfather's name.  He, he sounds like that just with an Italian accent.  Wow.  Yeah, he's, they're all like that. 
[03:35:30]  See, I thought that was an Italian accent.  No.  Well, Pat Cooper, I don't.  I guess it's just Brooklyn.  That's the guy from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  I put his book like underneath my computer and he saw it.  Oh, geez.  He goes, I'm glad you're using my book for something useful, you son of a bitch.  Now, you tell me this because I didn't get to talk to you yesterday.  Uh, what's, is this a stressful thing, Pat Cooper?  Because you have to keep up with him?  Um, just to keep him entertained.  Or is it just like, we just have to usher him in?  Because I would imagine Peter Criss yesterday would be very stressful for you. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  That's Jimmy Day.  That's Jimmy Guest Day.  We were talking about it with Who Kid.  Yeah, and then like his timing flipped because Nanu has to go downtown.  Less time for this.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  Um, Johnny in Ohio.  Hey, Sam.  What's the haps?  I would like to ask you the same question.  Hey.  Hey, um, I was going to ask you about your Apple video.  Since I didn't hear you plug it today, but I think I just did for you.  But I'm wondering, Pat Cooper, does that kind of give you the look into the future that 
[03:36:30]  you're going to be doing the same interview with Anthony 30 years from now?  How do you mean?  You mean, you think, you think...  You know, you're going to be in Anthony's spot, and Anthony's going to be  playing Pat Cooper.  You think Anthony is a young Pat Cooper?  Well, just for comedy's sake.  You know, play with me.  I don't know what you're talking about, Johnny.  I'm not going to play with you at all.  I'm going to kick you out of my house.  It's my house.  It's my rules, and if you don't like it, you can go home.  Play with me.  Eric, did you have any idea what that guy was talking about?  No, not at all. 
[03:37:00]  You had a rough one today.  Oh, he paid attention.  I'm fine.  I mean, if you didn't hear it, we were doing Jocktober, and again, Eric was asked for something,  and he had no idea what he was being asked about.  Sal, are you in the room when that happens?  Yeah.  You love it.  Well, I mean...  Sal had a big smile on his face.  It's funny.  I mean, it is pretty funny.  I'm going to tell you, I love it.  You know, we're being...  I love it.  Of course you do.  It's my favorite shit in the world.  Eric tried to throw you under the bus because he said Santa.  No, he didn't throw me under the bus.  He was telling the truth.  I mean, I messaged Eric on an alone message here. 
[03:37:30]  I messaged him, get Bobo on the phone, and let's see if Obie wants to do the fugitive with  Bobo.  And then Eric used that as an excuse and said, go on.  No, I'm sorry.  In all honesty, Eric was telling me to call Bobo at that moment in time, though.  Like, it all did happen in that time period, but Eric just didn't remember what happened  two minutes earlier, and I'm a victim of that, too.  The last I heard was him talking about recording Thunder for production.  But there was a full, like, you know, couple minutes of conversation that Eric blanked out 
[03:38:00]  on.  It happens sometimes, you know.  I mean, I'm not trying to make fun of him for it.  It happens to me all the time.  But Eric was instructed...  Well, you're not running the board.  No, I'm not.  I'm on the phones.  Right.  So, I mean, if you're running the board, you kind of got to not zone out, right?  You know, he was giving me instructions, so I can't...  I don't know.  But Eric is very good, actually, at doing that.  We're, like, giving instruction and listening to ONA at the same time, so Eric is...  Based on what?  He gets called out, like, four times a week for not hearing something.  But he is quite often, you know...  Do you think that's a skill of yours, Eric? 
[03:38:30]  Because I don't know what the fuck Sal is talking about, because I hear what I hear.  It's happened twice recently.  Yeah, and those aren't the first two times, but it has happened twice recently.  And by recently, you mean yesterday and today.  It's been a long time since that.  Has it?  Yeah, it has.  I don't know if that's the case.  It seems like it happens at least a couple times a week.  No.  Not at all.  Do you think you're good at multitasking?  Depends.  On what?  Depends on the day, I guess.  What are you talking about?  Either you're good or...  If he's in the man cave drinking Coke float. 
[03:39:00]  I mean, yeah.  Can you eat and play video games?  If you understand, Roland, if I'm in the man cave drinking Coke float.  That's why you're here, Eric.  Because I forget that people can't understand a word.  Yeah, because it caught me for a second.  I go, oh, okay.  Yeah.  No, I'm going to be very honest.  Eric is quite often...  He'll be telling an intern something.  He'll be telling me something.  And Opal chime in and say, Eric.  And then Eric can jump on it really quickly.  Eric, why is Sal sucking your ass?  I'm not sucking his ass.  I'm just telling it.  I'm talking to Eric.  Eric does get caught.  Eric, Eric.  You understand Sal is sucking your ass right now for some reason.  He is explaining what happened, even though nobody wants to hear the real answer. 
[03:39:30]  It's very strange.  No, the real answer is that you instructed him something that was ten seconds, and you  blinked out on two minutes of conversation.  No.  That's the missing piece of the puzzle.  No.  Because it was two minutes of conversation that you missed.  No.  It was absolutely...  Yes, it was.  I was in here.  Yeah, and you're not known for exaggerating on things.  It was two minutes of conversation that you missed.  Okay.  And Sal is saying, well, he told me something that took ten seconds.  So, that's why I was wondering why Sal is sucking your ass now, when off the air, he's 
[03:40:00]  all over your case.  He's an ass sucker.  Because I'm telling the truth of exactly what happened.  I'm not inflating anything right now.  Yeah, but you're not explaining why ten seconds of conversation resulted in two minutes of  lost conversation.  Well, I can't tell you why Eric didn't remember.  That's internally within Eric.  Right.  I'm just telling you what happened in the scenario.  But you're giving a...  He's an ass sucker.  He is a little bit, right, Roland?  How am I sucking his ass?  Because you're defending him, even though it doesn't make sense. 
[03:40:30]  Because it was what it was.  I'm not defending him.  I'm saying he didn't remember.  I'm telling you exactly what happened.  Plus, you are defending him, because you're also coming to his defense.  I'll talk to Eric, and then you'll be like, well, I do have to say, for Eric, I really  have to stand up.  All right.  It's a little ass sucky.  It's a little ass sucky.  You know what I mean?  I love that.  Like a little bit ass sucky.  Don't you think it is a bit?  I love that ass, yeah.  Ew.  Yeah.  You make sure you isolate that, Eric?  Yeah, I got that.  Are you going to...  Now, is this something that you think you're going to work on to make sure it doesn't happen 
[03:41:00]  again?  Or are you thinking, ah, it was a one-done thing.  I'm fine.  It's all trial by Eric.  Eric, this is why so many people love him, and so many people are beyond frustrated by him.  Because Eric is the type of guy who makes a mistake, and every mistake he makes, he says,  well, it just happened.  And then he goes on to make the mistake again and again and again and again.  Like, he's not a guy that admits, you know what, there's some things I got to work on, 
[03:41:30]  and then works on them, and then, you know, fixes them.  I love it.  Because you love seeing Eric getting in trouble.  I know it's like seeing him get in trouble.  It's just funny, when they yell at him, he goes, I don't care.  Correct me if I'm wrong, Eric.  The sentence that you just mumbled is, I don't like seeing Eric get in trouble.  Yeah.  Do you believe that, Eric?  Do you believe that Roland doesn't like seeing you get in trouble?  No, because what I do enjoy is when Eric comes back, so when he goes, I just don't care.  I'll say this.  I don't think Roland enjoys seeing anybody in trouble, but Roland does enjoy causing trouble 
[03:42:00]  for anything going on.  No, I didn't say does Roland enjoy people being in trouble.  Roland enjoys seeing them get in trouble.  Because Roland likes seeing you get yelled at.  He likes stirring the shit.  He loves stirring the shit.  And he loves seeing you get reprimanded.  Anytime anyone is reprimanding Eric, just because I'm on mic doesn't mean Roland isn't  somewhere laughing ten times as hard as me.  No, that is correct.  And Sal, you could suck whoever's ass you want to, but if we're going to tell the truth,  who enjoys Eric getting in trouble more than Roland? 
[03:42:30]  Anyone?  Roland will be cackling just...  Thank you.  Well, I love it because Eric just doesn't give a shit.  They go, Eric, I don't care.  No, don't.  He's the king of spin right now.  He's spinning it because he's saying he likes to see Eric like it's a positive thing.  You like to see Eric miserable, period.  Yes, you do.  No, but I like it when he fires back.  You're telling me you don't like to see Eric miserable?  I like to see everybody miserable.  That's true.  Across the board?  That's true.  It's true.  Everyone here likes seeing everyone get in trouble or getting called out or becoming miserable. 
[03:43:00]  It's true, but not everybody here sucks as much ass as you.  That's true.  I don't think I was sucking ass.  I would love to know.  Eric must have talked to you or something.  Because I got to tell you guys, Sal, last week, was back in the back office telling Eric to go fuck himself,  telling Eric all this kind of shit.  And we were all like, whoa, where's this coming from?  And you take the papers.  Yeah, he wouldn't do anything Eric told him to.  He wouldn't do anything Eric asked him to.  He called him a piece of shit.  You did call Eric a piece of shit, correct? 
[03:43:30]  I mean, yeah, I called him other things, too, yeah.  Eric, we have a â€“ the department that takes care of the live reads is called the traffic department.  Eric asked Sal to go bring this down to traffic.  He said, could you just bring this down to traffic for me?  And Sal responded by telling Eric to go play in traffic.  I mean, the disrespect that was oozing off of Sally was crazy.  And who said, you need to walk more than I do.  And that's what he said to Eric.  You need to walk more than I do.  And now Sal is coming in here like, well, in Eric's defense, I've got to say, I would love to know what happened. 
[03:44:00]  Is it because of the Barry Manilow autograph he got?  Did you get a Barry Manilow autograph?  Yes, my mom's a big fan.  Does she know about Tippi Tom?  Yes, she did.  Does she know that Barry Manilow had a beagle named Bagel?  Yes.  Does she know he might have had an affair with a homeless man?  Yes.  She knows that?  Yeah, my mom knows the whole back.  What does she think of that?  She thinks it's fucking hysterical.  She likes that?  Yeah.  Is she sexually attracted to Barry Manilow?  Maybe back in the 70s, but I don't think anymore because I think it's kind of obvious that he's together.  Are your parents still together?  Yeah.  Did your dad ever get jealous of Barry Manilow? 
[03:44:30]  No.  Do you think your parents still have sex?  I'd assume so.  Yeah, they bang it out.  You think they bang it out, Roland?  Right now.  Do you think they bang to you on the radio?  No, my mom works.  Are your parents good looking people still?  Or do they look older?  No, they keep in good shape and everything.  Oh, so they're definitely still banging.  I guess whatever.  Can Troy steal your mom away from your dad?  Probably not.  I don't think so.  Do you think that when your parents are having sex with each other, that your mom thinks of Barry Manilow instead of your dad? 
[03:45:00]  Sometimes.  Not every time.  She's probably done it in the past.  I mean, they've been together for a long time.  And it could be 70s Barry Manilow that she's thinking about.  Oh, definitely.  Not now.  I mean, it looks all plastic surgery now.  Do you think she ever calls your dad Barry?  Maybe.  Do you think your dad's cool with it?  Because he's like, well, it's just your thing.  I was born on the same day as Barry Manilow, and my name was nearly Barry.  Is there some incestual stuff going on?  Does she ever look at you kind of sexually now that you're getting a little older?  Because she named you, you know, she thinks, did she ever call you Barry?  No.  Or was that a Tacopa Cabana? 
[03:45:30]  Right, right.  She kind of thinks of you as her little Barry.  You have the same birthday.  Now you're starting to be that age where you're becoming a young man.  Yeah.  There is no Oedipal urges happening?  I don't think so.  Are you attracted to your mom?  No.  All right.  No.  What song do you think was playing when he was being conceived?  What song?  Yeah, Sal.  Do you know what song was playing when you were being conceived?  I have an idea.  I don't know.  It would probably be...  I think so.  I think so.  Did your dad tell her you can't... 
[03:46:00]  Like, the reason she wanted to name you Barry is because she was fantasizing conceiving you  with Barry Manilow.  Probably.  You're right.  Maybe she was thinking of Barry White.  Was it Barry White?  Is she more of a soul fan?  No, no.  She's like uber fanalow, they call him.  They call him what?  Fanalos.  Yeah.  Fanalos.  Is that like...  What do they call Bieber's fans?  Bieber fevers?  Beliebers.  Beliebers.  Is that like being a Belieber?  Yeah.  Except it's for like women who are, you know, plus 40.  Does she ever go to like Barry Manilow?  How old is your mom?  My mom is... 
[03:46:30]  She's 46.  Wow.  So she's not even old enough for DeRosa.  No.  Joe DeRosa would want an older woman than your mom.  I saw Barry Manilow in Vegas.  Why?  Part of the thing, if you live in Vegas, you guys have Barry Manilow.  No, I was in Vegas for a weekend.  I didn't even think for a second that I should go see Barry Manilow.  I was there for 40 years.  He's awesome.  You like him?  He was going to concert.  I mean...  Has your mom seen him in concert?  Oh, she's seen him hundreds of times.  Tell me this, and I don't mean to be disrespectful.  Yeah.  Do you think your mom's panties have ever gotten wet at a Barry Manilow concert? 
[03:47:00]  Maybe.  I mean...  You think probably.  Yeah, why not?  She probably tossed them on stage.  Did she ever toss her panties to Barry Manilow?  Your mom, I mean, Sal.  Uh, probably not.  I'd say maybe a bra, maybe, in the 70s or something like that, but not panties.  Wow.  Which is her favorite song?  I hate Barry Manilow.  I really...  What's her favorite song?  Uh...  Now, do you hate Barry Manilow because you picture him fucking your mom?  Yeah.  You know, by the way.  Or he sings to Mandy.  You know, even though he looks different now, even though, you know, he's much older, even 
[03:47:30]  though your mom is very happily married to your dad, even though they had a beautiful  son and named him Sal.  Yes.  All that aside, if your mom were to meet Barry Manilow, she would fuck him.  You know that's true.  I'd probably say yes.  If he was like...  Like, if she'd come up here...  When was he up here?  I would ruin that family.  He was up here yesterday?  Yesterday, yeah.  If she'd come up here to meet him, not only would she have had sex with him, I think 
[03:48:00]  she would have let him come in her.  Really?  Without protection.  And made a little, like...  Has she gone through menopause?  And I don't mean to be disrespectful.  I don't know.  If she hasn't, and her womb is still fertile, which we don't know.  Based on her age, it could be, it couldn't be.  If her womb was still fertile, do you believe she would allow Barry Manilow to impregnate  her at this stage in the game?  I believe she would.  Yeah, I'd say so, too.  You think so?  She wants to give birth to the little Barry that she never had. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Would she love the Barry Manilow kid more than you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Would you think she would fuck the kid when he got older?  Probably not.  That's disgusting.  That's ridiculous.  Why would you say something like that?  That's an insane premise altogether.  That doesn't make any sense.  But, she would definitely make sure this music was playing in the delivery room.  Yeah.  When I was born, Kenny Rogers was playing in the delivery room.  Really?  You picked a fine time to leave me.  Lucille was playing while I was born.  All right.  Well, is your mom...  That's the Barry Manilow your mom liked back then? 
[03:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  1978?  Like the 78 with the fro, yeah.  She liked...  Oh, with the fro.  Yeah.  You think your mom would like me at all?  Or...  Maybe.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'd fuck your mom.  Would you?  I'm married, she's married, it's all good.  It's all good, yeah.  It's fine.  Whatever.  Whatever, right, Roland?  My parents could be swingers, I don't even know.  Do you think they are?  No, but I said they could be.  Theoretically.  That's not like they're going to tell you.  Why would they tell that to you?  Yeah, that's true.  Wow, I can't believe your mom would fuck Barry Manilow even today. 
[03:49:30]  Does your mom, Eric, have any celebrity crushes?  Yeah, I can't...  I'm just trying to remember who.  My mom.  But back on Barry Manilow, my dad used to work with Barry Manilow.  Oh, did he fuck him?  No.  Okay.  Is this a question?  No.  Financially.  What did...  I think, yes, financially you did.  What did your dad say about Barry Manilow?  He, I don't know, he never really talked about it, but he's got a bunch of gold and platinum 
[03:50:00]  records hanging at his house from Barry Manilow.  Ugh.  That's a terrible thing to hang up in your house.  My dad used to handle his publishing rights.  Yeah, but still, just put him in a closet somewhere.  Why would, like, everybody's like, whoa!  They're in his office.  Barry Manilow, huh, Mr. Nagel?  Huh, Papa E-Rock?  That's pretty cool.  Barry, Elton John.  Elton John's cool.  I would hang up an Elton John record, but not a Barry Manilow record.  Like, Barry Manilow...  Sold a lot of records.  Barry Manilow, though, like, is known as, like, a nerdy, like, that's a nerdy thing  to be into.  Barry Manilow. 
[03:50:30]  I'll see if I can get a photo of it today.  Of what?  Of the record.  He's also written a lot for, like, other artists.  Yeah?  Commercials.  And a lot of, yeah, a lot of jingles.  You know a lot about Barry Manilow for somebody who doesn't like it?  Does your mom tell a lot of Barry Manilow stories?  Yeah, just tune them out, usually.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How often does she talk about Barry Manilow?  Like, she'll bring it up, like...  What?  Now?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  She's just really...  It's like her Rob Zombie, you know?  Yeah, but I don't want to fuck Rob Zombie.  Really? 
[03:51:00]  Or, you know...  I mean, I would, but I don't want to actively, I'm saying.  It's not...  No, it's not, because, like, if Jess was, like, constantly bringing up, like...  I don't know.  What's the guy?  Gavin from Bush or something?  I don't know.  Some good-looking...  Gavin Rossdale?  Yeah, whatever.  Whoever.  I don't care who it was, but some guy that I know she's, you know, sexually attracted  to, and she was just bringing him up in conversation all the time, I'd be like, knock that shit  off.  Like, it's cute at first, but now just stop it.  Yeah, but I'm her son.  I'm not married to my mother, you know?  And your dad's not...  She doesn't do it with your dad?  Oh, my dad fucking hates Barry Manilow. 
[03:51:30]  And if my mom was doing that, I'd be even worse, because I'd be like, Mom, I do not want  to hear stories about the guy that you wish you were fucking instead of dad.  Please stop bringing it up.  You know?  Uh...  You gotta put your foot down.  That's awkward.  That is an uncomfortable conversation to have.  I'm gonna tell her that.  Tell her that.  And tell her I said that, too.  Does she know who I am?  She knows who you are, of course.  Tell her I said that.  Tell her it is uncomfortable.  When he calls his mom, he puts her on the speakerphone.  He does?  Mm-hmm.  In the office?  Yeah.  Roland, you make sure he tells her that. 
[03:52:00]  I'm gonna go, Mama, I saw the dog.  You wanna call her now?  You can call her now and talk to her.  All right, yeah.  Ask her those questions.  Go ahead.  All right.  Let's give Erica a phone.  My mom loves Julio Garcia.  Yes.  Give Erica a phone number.  Let's see.  I gotta see how it feels to be in this seat.  Because I've been in Sal's seat enough times.  I've never volunteered my mother up like this.  I gotta tell her that Sal volunteered her.  Because that's just disrespectful.  Because he always says...  You always say no.  But you're like, if you have to, you have to.  Yeah, because it's uncomfortable.  But I do it.  Yeah.  Ben, welcome to After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:52:30]  Yo, Sam Roberts, man.  How's it going, Ben?  Why don't they pay you more money?  You're all over this station.  You know what they did?  First of all, I think I am in the running for CEO of the company.  I've heard in February there's going to be an opening.  And I'd like to officially announce my candidacy for CEO of SiriusXM.  Can I be your vice president?  Yes, you can.  Go upstairs and slap those grody niggers for some more money.  Well, I don't know if I'm going to use those words specifically.  That's, you know, your choice.  But no, the reason they don't pay me more money is because everybody around here has figured out that I'm a chump and a sucker. 
[03:53:00]  And, you know, I'm not going anywhere.  There's no place for me to go.  So, you know, why not?  If they lose you to Vince McMahon, the world will be a worse place for it.  I'm telling you.  I appreciate that, Ben.  Not a problem, brother.  All right.  I'm going to talk to Sal's mom.  Hello, is this Sal's mom?  Yes, it is.  How are you today, ma'am?  I'm well.  How are you?  I'm good.  I want you to know something.  I want you to know something here that I don't want you to think there's disrespectful stuff going on.  Sal, we were talking to Sal mainly about Barry Manilow. 
[03:53:30]  And he said, do you want me to go get my mom on the phone?  Because I was asking some questions that I would even â€“ if somebody were asking these questions to me, I would deem them inappropriate.  But Sal said, why don't we get my mom on the phone and we'll just ask her?  So I want you â€“  You're going to ask me Barry questions?  Well, mainly about what â€“ what is it that you like about Barry Manilow?  Because Sal says you're obsessed with him.  I am obsessed with him. 
[03:54:00]  That you're a fan-ilow.  I am a fan-ilow.  When he was recently here at Radio City, he was here for three nights.  I was there for all three nights.  I follow him around.  He was â€“  What?  What do you mean you follow him around?  Barry was in the Revel, which is a hotel in Atlantic City.  Yeah.  And I saw him in the lobby and I chased him.  Why did you â€“ was this recently?  Yes, just about three weeks ago. 
[03:54:30]  You're a married woman, right?  Yes, I am.  What does your husband think about the fact that you're chasing Barry Manilow through, like, hotel lobbies?  He knows about my obsession.  Yeah.  So it all is good.  I'm actually â€“ I'm in my office right now and I can see â€“ I have a Barry Manilow shade.  I have a Barry Manilow â€“  Like, the â€“ someone got an airbrushed Barry Manilow, like, portrait of, like, the blinds in her office.  You put that in your place of business?  Yes.  Why?  That way it doesn't â€“ don't people come in and not take you terribly seriously? 
[03:55:00]  Of course they take me seriously.  I'm just a fan-ilow.  I love Barry.  Now â€“  Are you bashing Barry?  Because I'm not going to tolerate that.  Have you heard the Tippy Tom story?  You know he has a beagle named Bagel?  Yes, I do know he has a beagle named Bagel and he also had a beagle named Biali.  How do you know that?  I don't even have â€“ because all fan-ilows know that.  That's very strange.  What do the fan-ilows think of the accusations that Tippy Tom, a homeless man, once made that he had indeed lived with and possibly had an affair with Barry Manilow? 
[03:55:30]  I don't believe that.  You don't because you need his heterosexuality to be golden for you.  That's correct.  So I can chase him and be obsessed with Barry, of course.  Let me ask you this.  If you had come up here when â€“ because he was up here, I guess, yesterday?  Yeah.  Yes, he was.  Don't get all excited.  But I have to ask you, if you had come up here and gotten to meet him, let's say â€“ this is a hypothetical â€“  Oh, my God.  Would you have offered yourself physically to him? 
[03:56:00]  Yes.  You would?  You would â€“  If you had three, my husband would be fine with it.  Three?  There's three people?  Three.  Usually it's just â€“ okay, who are the top three?  I'm not telling you that.  My son is in the room.  Good.  Who are the â€“ well, he was telling â€“ I was â€“ listen, I was telling him that it's very uncomfortable for you as a mother to be talking to your son â€“ because Sal says that you bring up Barry Manilow at home all the time.  And that he kind of tunes out.  And I wanted him to make sure that you knew that it's very strange and awkward and almost Oedipal for you to be talking to your son about the man who you wish you were having sex with instead of your husband. 
[03:56:30]  Like, that's a weird thing for a child to â€“ or your son to kind of cope with.  Is it really Salvatore?  Is that true?  No.  Salvatore?  It's really not that bad.  But think about it in the context of, like, there is a â€“ you were going to name Sal Barry, correct?  Oh, my God.  Yes.  It's very strange. 
[03:57:00]  You know why, right?  Because he was born on Barry Manilow's birthday?  Correct.  He was.  Now â€“  His middle name is close proximity to Barry, but it's not Barry.  What's his middle name?  Mary?  You'll have to show you that with us.  Brandon.  Brandon, okay.  That's an awful white name.  Salvatore Brandon.  Yeah, Brandon.  That's the worst middle â€“ the Italian middle name.  Two Guinea names and, like, white name in the middle.  When you were conceiving Sal, were you picturing Barry Manilow instead of your husband?  No.  Is it possible that you â€“ have you done that? 
[03:57:30]  You've done it before.  Sam, Salvatore's in the room.  No, he's not listening, though.  You've done that.  You've pictured Barry Manilow.  And the question is â€“  Absolutely.  And the question is, when you picture him, do you picture him now or then?  No, no.  No, no.  80s Barry is my favorite.  80s.  Okay.  80s Barry.  As a matter of fact, if you want, I'll send you a picture of the shade in my office so  that you can see what I'm talking about.  I'm looking at it right now.  Yeah, send that to Sal so he can show that to all of us. 
[03:58:00]  So you would have let Barry Manilow have sex with you, though, yesterday.  Would you have pictured 80s â€“ absolutely, she said.  Would you have pictured Barry Manilow from the 80s while Barry Manilow from 2012 was having  sex with you?  Absolutely.  Barry from the 80s is my favorite, though I love Barry 2012, but not as much as Barry  from the 80s.  Would this have to be like a classy thing or would you go â€“ like if he was like, hey,  Sal's mom, if you want to hit up this bathroom stall here at SiriusXM, where your son works 
[03:58:30]  for a living.  I'm in.  I'm in.  You're in.  And he doesn't â€“ by the way, he refuses to use protection.  Who?  Barry Manilow.  Oh, you got me scared there for a second.  I thought you were talking about Salvatore.  No, he doesn't either.  But Barry â€“ but Barry Manilow refuses to use protection.  You're still in.  I'm in.  I'm in.  Just â€“ I really â€“ I love him.  I've had a couple of opportunities where I almost met him and I just â€“  Well, yeah, you chased him across a hotel lobby. 
[03:59:00]  It was bad.  It was down a flight â€“ an escalator.  I mean, his security stopped and asked me.  They said, ma'am, please, it's early.  Barry is tired.  And I said, I know.  I was at last night's concert.  Oh, my God.  And he said that I could follow him.  I followed him straight to the car and then I waved to him from far away, but he kind of  ignored me.  Because you're a woman.  What if â€“  Salvatore.  Yeah, don't talk about Barry Manilow like that.  She gets offended, yeah.  What if â€“ you know Barry Manilow.  Not only does he not use protection, he doesn't pull out. 
[03:59:30]  Are you okay with that?  I'm so okay.  Yeah, I'm so over that.  I'm so much older, so don't worry about it.  Oh, okay.  And that answers the question.  And Sal didn't know whether or not you had gone through menopause.  And that answers that.  Are you serious?  He didn't know.  He didn't know for sure.  Why are you discussing this with my son?  I needed to know the facts before I made any assumptions.  You understand.  I didn't want to make any disparaging remarks about you without knowing exactly what was  going on.  Oh, Sam, you're such a shitster.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Sal is actually the shitster here because he just started â€“ do you think on After 
[04:00:00]  Open Anthony Live, I'm just bringing up Barry Manilow?  Sal is over here being like, oh, Barry Manilow, that's that guy my mom wants to fuck.  Well, Roland brought it up first.  Yeah.  He got me a signed CD.  I'm very excited.  I can't wait to see it.  Yeah.  Just the fact that he knew my name yesterday when he signed it, I'm beside myself.  Well, he knew there was a person with your name.  I mean, he didn't know your name.  Have you ever thrown your panties at Barry Manilow in concert? 
[04:00:30]  No, I have not.  I have not.  I've thrown him flowers.  Wow.  But not my panties.  I usually keep those on.  I'm going to ask you a question, and you may find this offensive, but it's something  that we need to clear for the record, because it was discussed earlier, and it's just we  need the facts, okay?  Okay.  I'm in.  Go.  As far as the panties go at the Barry Manilow concert, you said you left them on.  Yes, I did.  Have they been wet at the concerts?  You know, with â€“ have they been â€“  Maybe 80s Barry, not 2012 Barry. 
[04:01:00]  So in the 1980s, you'd go to Barry Manilow concerts, and you would get wet.  Okay.  Okay, so you really are a fan.  That's where we're trying to get with this.  You really are a fan.  I really am.  I'm a true fan of Low.  I followed him.  He's going to be on Broadway, so maybe some of the ONA fans and certainly the after-show  fans may want to go.  He's going to be there for six weeks.  Ma, enough with the plug.  You're plugging Barry Manilow.  Plugging Barry Manilow.  He'd probably be very happy.  He's probably more likely â€“  I am because â€“  Yeah. 
[04:01:30]  He's probably more likely to have sex with you if he finds out that you were plugging  him on the radio.  That's only â€“  Hell yeah.  That can only be good.  Does your husband not feel like a little bit emasculated that you would be this â€“ like,  not only is it like, oh, if it would ever happen, I'd be allowed to have sex with Barry  Manilow unprotected and he could finish inside me.  But you're also at the point where you're chasing him through hotel lobbies to get  to him, so it's not like that's out of the realm of possibility.  And let's be honest, it's not exactly â€“ the choices that Barry Manilow has for women these 
[04:02:00]  days are not the 80s, so you probably have a much better shot, I would think.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  I probably do have a better shot.  But your husband doesn't feel emasculated by that?  He just lets me have my craziness.  He just â€“ everybody in the family knows, you know, it's just who I am, what I do.  Who are the other two men?  I'm not telling you.  Are they personal friends?  No.  No, no, no.  Are they celebrities?  Yes.  Well, you can tell me who the celebrities are.  I'm not letting you know.  Why not?  Because my son is in the room. 
[04:02:30]  Why do I care for the celebrities?  You have a little dignity just to tell you â€“  Okay, I'll have â€“  Like Burt Reynolds and â€“  It probably is Burt Reynolds.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, ew, that's gross.  Barry Manilow.  Sal, you step out of the room.  Okay.  Okay.  Sal is outside of the room.  Okay.  Okay.  It's George Clooney.  Okay, that's â€“  I knew that already.  That's typical.  He wasn't really outside the room.  And who â€“  And I have a new one.  Oh.  Brand new.  Brand new.  Ashton Kutcher?  No, he's a little boy.  Yeah, but he's willing to â€“ he's willing to trade up as far as age goes. 
[04:03:00]  I know.  How old do you think I am?  Well, yeah, okay.  You're old enough to have a crush on Barry Manilow.  So, who is â€“ who is the third?  The third is Anson Mount.  Anson â€“ who's Anson Mount?  Is it Clint Eastwood?  He's on Hell on Wheels.  He's really, really cute.  What's Hell on Wheels?  You don't know about him.  Oh, the new show.  Whoa.  Okay.  Anson Mount is this, like, mountain man, bearded, long-haired â€“ 
[04:03:30]  Exactly.  Whoa.  Googling him.  This does not look like Barry Manilow.  I know.  I know.  Which one of those three men does your husband most resemble?  None.  Wow.  So, he's just got three guys that he can't live up to.  Does your husband have girls that he gets to bang?  I would â€“ I guess so.  You don't care.  You really â€“ you're really too consumed with Barry Manilow.  My three and Barry Manilow, absolutely.  Now, you've pleasured yourself to Barry Manilow before, correct?  All right, Sam.  Well, you â€“ 
[04:04:00]  I'm just â€“ no, because I'm asking.  What song does she pleasured yourself to?  Yeah, and the question is â€“  What did Roland just say, because I didn't hear him.  The question Roland has â€“ and this is a Roland question â€“ is,  when pleasuring yourself to Barry Manilow, what song would you play, generally?  Weekend in New England.  Well, that answers that question, doesn't it?  I'm not scared why you left.  Oh, good.  Is that the goodbye music?  No, that's â€“ that's your song.  Unless â€“ I thought you might want to â€“ I know you're at work, 
[04:04:30]  but if you want to make â€“ you shut your office door and â€“  My office door is shut.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll play the song, and we'll just kind of be quiet while you do your thing, if you want.  No, I'm all right.  I'm good.  You don't want to masturbate for us?  No, I'm good.  Okay.  Listen.  Some manic-cut.  Listen, Sal's mom.  Oh, Sam, oh, Sam.  You better call me when this is on.  You've been a very good sport.  You've raised a great son.  I wish he had â€“  I am.  That's my point.  How old do you think I am? 
[04:05:00]  I'm under the assumption that you're in your late 40s.  Oh, very good.  That's it.  Okay, good.  Which means, I mean, you couldn't have gone through menopause that long ago.  You know what I'm doing right now?  I've got my hand down my pants.  You can ask your son.  I'm jerking off in front of your son right now.  Don't do that.  He's watching me.  He's watching me jerk.  And Sal's now jerking off.  And Sal's jerking off, too.  No, don't say that. 
[04:05:30]  And Roland's just in between us going, what do you want from me?  I'm just kidding.  Sal's not really jerking off.  I am.  I'm almost finished.  I'm almost there.  Okay.  It's almost over.  There it goes.  Finished.  Are you done?  I'm glad I got that out of my system.  I'm glad you did, too.  Listen, Sal's mom.  You've been a great sport here.  Thank you.  You're giving my mother some competition, quite frankly.  But I'll tell you this.  There's a very strange thing going on between you and your son.  Because, you know, when Obie gets my mom on the air, I object. 
[04:06:00]  I go, no.  Why would you call my mom?  This is going to be terrible.  I hate this.  When I was just simply asking Sal questions about you, not only was he forthcoming with  his opinions on your sexuality.  And, by the way, I think it's a beautiful thing that you're still a very sexual woman,  which you obviously are.  But he goes, why don't we go get my mom on the phone?  He offered you to me.  He threw me under the bus, huh?  You don't like younger men?  No, not really.  You know, I mean, because, like, technically a guy who has a radio show, even if it is technically 
[04:06:30]  an after show, could still be considered a celebrity.  I mean, there's no reason.  I'll make you four.  How's that?  I would love to be on your list.  And Sal says you're quite good looking.  And I'll tell you this, too.  I'll tell you this, Sal's mom.  Just because, if you make me at number four, and Sal ever brings you in here, I'm not  going to get into specifics, but I'll make your dreams come true.  That's all I'll say.  Will you put on a Barry mask and sing for me? 
[04:07:00]  I will.  Just to make it weirder.  Stone cold Barry?  I just get, it'll just get weird.  Yeah, I'll put on the Barry mask, but I'll be doing a stone cold voice.  It'll just get fucking weird.  Is that cool?  Yeah, that's, I'm not interested.  You just killed the whole mood.  No, trust me, trust me.  When I do it, and when we're in the right scenario, and we're playing this song, and  you're getting all excited, and we'll bring in your Barry Manilow window shades, and you'll  be all revved up.  Oh, can't wait.  All right.  Your mom does baked goods.  Does she do baked goods? 
[04:07:30]  My mom can't cook at all.  Oh, forget it.  That's all right.  Your mom's got other assets, obviously.  Some of which I'd like to see at some point.  I'm only kidding.  Or am I?  Or are you?  You're rubbing your balls.  I'll let that.  No, I finished.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, sorry.  Thank you.  It's over.  It's over.  It's over.  Okay.  This is the part she climaxes to, so.  While looking at a photo of Sal on her nightstand.  Do you, when you're pledging yourself to Barry Manilow, do you put the pictures of Sal 
[04:08:00]  down so that he's not looking at you?  Stop it.  It's rude.  Terrible question.  I'm sorry about that.  I'm sorry.  Well, thank you for being such a good sport, Sal's mom.  You're very welcome, Sam.  Enjoy the rest of your day.  Have a wonderful day.  Thank you.  You too.  Bye.  Bye.  I just wish your mom would teach you how to deliver on the radio as well as she does.  Yeah, she does well.  She was great.  Yeah, she was.  She was talking about all her great stories.  Yeah, she's a lot of fun.  I'll bet she is.  I'd like to find out for myself. 
[04:08:30]  She put me as number four.  You heard that, right?  I know.  You made it on the list.  Would you be pissed if I fucked your mom?  Or would it be like, you know what?  Sam's at it again.  That's Sam.  He just fucked my mom.  But he's a goofy guy.  I get a little upset, I'd say.  But I'd be like, ah, Sal, we're just goofing.  Just goofing.  I'll be your stepdad in a couple weeks.  Exactly.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  Who do you think is a bigger Barry Manilow fan?  Sal's mom or Dave's mom?  Eastside Dave?  I don't know.  I'd have to talk to Eastside Dave about that.  But I wouldn't fuck Eastside Dave's mom out of respect for Eastside Dave. 
[04:09:00]  If I'll say that.  You're a good man.  Yeah, I am.  Well, we didn't really get to...  I'm going to give one thing away because I promised.  We don't have time.  I'm just going to give it to this guy.  Matt.  Hey, how's it going?  How's it going, buddy?  Hey, I wanted to play.  What did you learn?  What did you...  You got to make it quick.  Okay.  What I learned was once the radio station gets featured on Jocktober...  No, it took too long.  Damien?  Damien, make it quick. 
[04:09:30]  I learned that there's hope for old age because Pat Cooper is 83.  I would love to be like him when I'm his age.  All right, Damien.  You just won this D.L. Hughley book, so stay on hold.  And somebody get his address.  It's an autographed D.L. Hughley book.  The book is called I Want You to Shut the Fuck Up.  The same thought that Sal was having towards his mom while she was on the phone being very revealing.  I wonder if that will come up on the air tomorrow.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  And we'll be back tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over. 
[04:10:00]  For real this time. </pre>
