<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of "Whip'em Out Wednesday," focusing on cars displaying "WOW" stickers and the hosts' reactions. This transitioned into a commentary on the Olympics, specifically Jim Norton's disdain for diving and track race strategies.  The show then delved into TLC's "My Shocking Story," highlighting the episode "I Can't Stop Growing," featuring individuals with extreme gigantism.  The hosts graphically described the physical abnormalities, employing crude and offensive language.  Caller Keith offered a particularly vivid description of one woman's feet.  Other episodes like "My Big Foot" and the upcoming "Sexomnia" were also mentioned.

The conversation shifted to Christina Applegate's double mastectomy, followed by extensive, sexually explicit discussion of Paraguayan javelin thrower Lerin Franco, whom the hosts encouraged listeners to "Google bomb."  They also discussed pictures of other Olympians, including naked athletes Sarah Baberg and several nude German athletes, with sexually charged commentary comparing their attractiveness.  Technical difficulties, including an internet outage, disrupted planned online content.  A brief Ernest Borgnine clip was played before the segment concluded with further discussion of Lerin Franco and the technical issues.

Opie then began a segment by discussing images of a woman in a red bathing suit, comparing his experiences with prostitutes and massage therapists to the intimacy of a relationship. This led to a news story about Cindy McCain's wrist injury from a handshake, sparking a vulgar discussion about derogatory terms for women, culminating in a "top five" list. A sound effect censored a suggestive retelling of the McCain story.  The hosts speculated on Barack Obama's and John McCain's VP choices, interspersed with vulgar jokes.

Brian Regan then joined the show, promoting his appearances and new DVD, amid further interruptions and tangents from the hosts.  The conversation covered Michael Phelps and an attractive Latino boxer, leading to sexually suggestive comments.  Further digressions included a story about Opie attending a party with low celebrity turnout, a detailed discussion of Anthony's gun collection, and a story about an elderly woman defending her home against a burglar.  Regan discussed his creative process, contrasted with absurd and offensive answers to hypothetical interview questions.  The segment ended with stories about a pregnant woman splattered with feces and a baby whale mistaking a yacht for its mother.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls detailing feces-related pranks involving dog and human excrement, targeting cars, houses, and gym equipment.  One caller described a "poop purse" prank, while another recounted filling Snapple bottles with urine and feces and launching them at houses.  The discussion then turned to Gary Glitter's attempt to avoid deportation.  Brian Regan briefly reappeared in studio before leaving, sparking speculation.  The hosts discussed a call with a female trucker, a rumor of an XM radio bathroom accident, and the Sirius/XM merger.

A lengthy interview with Roy Dan Hollander, a lawyer suing Columbia University over its women's studies program, followed.  The discussion covered gender inequality, the Violence Against Women Act, and comparisons to other identity-based programs. Hollander's arguments and the hosts' reactions were debated.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the Fab Faux Beatles tribute band.

A phone interview with Roy Den Hollander, focusing on his lawsuits against the Violence Against Women Act, ladies' nights, and women's studies programs, was featured. Hollander argued these entities unconstitutionally infringe on men's rights, citing his divorce. He claimed VAWA allows alien women to gain citizenship by falsely accusing husbands, alleging government suppression of evidence. He used vulgar and offensive language. The hosts, along with a caller, challenged his views, questioning his motivations.  The conversation became heated, with personal insults exchanged, culminating in Hollander hanging up.  The hosts analyzed the interview and a caller reinforced their view of Hollander's behavior.

The final segment analyzed a listener's MySpace page belonging to a man named Roy, described as a lawyer who takes hip-hop dance classes.  The hosts and callers analyzed his friends list, speculating on his relationships, using crude and offensive language.  Much of the discussion focused on William H. Macy's acting, referencing specific films. A caller's vulgar email to Roy was read.  The hosts speculated on Roy's age and sexual orientation.  The "Line of the Day" segment was presented before the show concluded abruptly due to time constraints.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Hey, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday, by the way.  It certainly is.  Whip out those fun bags, you broads.  Yeah.  I see a lot of trucks and cars out there with a wow on it. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  I saw some guy as I was driving in the other day with one of those.  Just, he improvised.  Used a little electrical tape and just put a wow on the back.  Yeah.  Boy, did he look like a guy that really needed to see some.  He looked like the kind of guy that probably just pays to see him.  You know?  Didn't look like many girls probably come up to him.  Well, that's not saying much for our Whip'em Out Wednesday thing.  No, it was just the one guy. 
[00:01:00]  There's a couple construction crews on the Upper West Side.  They got big, huge wows.  Oh, yeah.  As they're building buildings.  The buildings.  I don't know exactly where it is.  I would give them a little promotion today.  Yeah.  And then there's this guy I was chasing on the Long Island Expressway over the weekend.  Chasing?  Because he had a wow sticker.  Oh.  I get excited when I see the wow stickers.  No, I'm not flashing.  But I want to go, hey, thanks, man.  And they always look like, get away from me, you creep.  I'm looking for chicks. 
[00:01:30]  Who the hell are you?  I'm like, no, man.  You got my name on your car.  I just want to say thanks.  They don't care.  They just want to see girls.  But I'm beeping and waving.  I look like a lunatic.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Yes, that's what those wow stickers mean.  Wow, wow, wow.  So, last night, I turned on the Olympics because that's what most of America is doing.  Unless you're Jim Norton or Anthony Cumia.  Yeah.  Not true at all.  Not true.  You watched last night, Jimmy? 
[00:02:00]  No.  Oh.  I didn't either.  I attempted to watch, and then they had that diving on.  Yeah, you don't like the diving?  Diving is stupid.  It really is just dumb.  It's a dumb sport.  And then they had, like, the quarterfinals of some of those track races where no one really tries  because all they have to do is come in the first four positions, so they just slow down at the end,  which I think is really dumb.  And the Olympics should make it the top eight, like, best times during the qualifying and have them run in the finals 
[00:02:30]  because then you would see some really exciting races instead of everyone holding back at the last, you know,  a few yards or meters so they could save themselves for the finals.  It's just dumb.  It's just dumb.  So, I'm like, all right, I've got to watch something else.  So, I go to TLC.  My God.  We've talked about TLC over the years.  It's a learning channel.  No, it's not the learning channel.  It's the Freak channel.  It's the Sideshow channel.  P.T. Barnum channel.  It's the P.T. Barnum channel. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  You're right, Anthony.  But it's under the guise that we're learning something.  It's what the L stands for, learning.  No, I turn it on and go, ah!  Yeah.  That's exactly what it is.  You turn it on and they know that they're going to be freaking you out.  Yeah.  With their medical anomalies and other things that are going to make you go, oh, my God, thank God that's not me.  Yeah, and over the years we've talked about Tree Man and Ant Face and what were some of the others? 
[00:03:30]  Root Man.  Root Man.  Yeah, and then the guy with Out of Face.  Out of Face Man.  Yeah.  With the tumors that just continue to grow.  Ugh.  So, I'm like, I'm going to go to TLC.  They're always good for something because this is the Olympics.  But I'm going to put the Olympics in a small box on the left corner just in case something happens.  Were you going pip?  I did a little pip.  You were pipping?  I was doing some pipping last night.  A little pip.  Those dumb divers.  Oh, woo-woo, splash.  Woo-woo-woo, splash.  I don't even know what they're doing.  They're twisting and turning great. 
[00:04:00]  Good for you.  So, TLC had, please, if you saw this show, call immediately, 877-212-ON-A.  They had a show called, I Can't Stop Growing.  I Can't Stop Growing.  Even their names are such P.T. Barnum names.  Because it's just, it gives you a description of what the show is.  And you know exactly what you're getting.  Trust me. 
[00:04:30]  Go, a lot of people are still in their homes.  DVR or whatever the hell you do, I Can't Stop Growing on TLC.  It's an hour of laughter.  And it's the learning, chow.  I'm supposed to be learning about this.  I'm not learning.  I'm like, oh, show me more, show me more, show me more.  Basically, I think 200 people have this disease in the entire world.  And basically.  Wow, what luck that is.  We've all heard of, like, that giantism, you know, thing where the pituitary gland is shooting off some crap and you just keep growing. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, they grow to be nine feet tall and talk like this.  Right.  Well, it's a form of that.  But these lucky individuals get, like, one or two parts of their body that continue to grow.  It could be the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Could be the greatest thing.  There was a...  All right, I've got to go right to Keith.  He described it perfectly because we were trying to figure out how to describe this.  Keith, you nailed it. 
[00:05:30]  Go ahead.  I watched that show last night and that lady, her two feet looked like they were in two big black garbage bags.  So, disturbing to watch.  Yes.  The lady with the big hand with the big fat fingers clapping.  Yeah.  Focus on her hand.  Yeah, basically they showed one lady who, her left hand, it might have been a dude, I don't even know.  His left hand, no joke, was easily five times bigger than his right hand or her right hand.  Just deformed and huge. 
[00:06:00]  They're saying the elephant man had this disease, but, you know, he...  No, sometimes just...  Oh, okay.  Sometimes things catch me on the news and I take a look.  Yeah, well, the elephant man had an extreme version of this.  Yeah.  That's why his whole body was completely destroyed.  But this woman or guy, last night, yeah, the hand was about five times bigger than the right hand.  But the real catch was this woman in England who, they estimated her legs alone weigh over 100 pounds.  And she was petite from the head to about her belly button. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And then the hips went, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Like yeast.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  They were huge.  And then the legs were...  How big were the legs?  Oh, my God.  I can't even describe them.  Like 55-gallon drums.  They were just huge.  They were beyond huge.  And then she had, like, Herman Munster feet.  Anthony said that in the office.  She had the big boots on, Herman Munster boots. 
[00:07:00]  They're custom made.  Grandpa, you put a spell on me that made my legs big, Grandpa.  Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.  It backfired, Herman.  I was just laughing and pointing and screaming with delight.  And her feet, you can't even describe how big they were.  There's not a size.  She has to have custom made, quote, shoes made.  But it's just material that they kind of wrap around these massive things. 
[00:07:30]  And didn't she have a club foot also?  She had a club foot.  God really took care of this one.  So her foot was facing the other direction.  Right.  If she even attempts to, like, go to a church, I would slap her in the face.  God doesn't like you.  It's obvious.  God hates you.  He really does.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  And then, God, what was that thing that Stunt Brain was showing us?  It was called My Big Foot. 
[00:08:00]  Is that it?  But they're simple with the titles.  What do you want to call this one?  My Big Foot.  It's a lady with a big foot.  The entire episode originally aired in the BBC.  And they've got some of the episodes now coming to TLC.  And that one was called, exactly, My Big Foot.  And there is Man With No Face.  And there is the one that hopefully will be shown here at the end of the season is the Sexomia. 
[00:08:30]  They don't have it listed on the schedule yet.  But it's people who can't stop having sex in their sleep.  Like violent sex.  Yeah, one person has violent sex.  You have no idea that you're having sex with your spouse.  A woman can't, one woman, she can't stop taking care of herself at night.  She just lays there and just goes to town.  How hot is that?  Can't stop.  I mean, how bad is that?  It all depends on what she looks like.  What's the name of the show?  Repressed Abuse Memories?  Yeah.  No kidding.  But, wow. 
[00:09:00]  So you've got to check this show out.  It's on TLC.  It's called I Can't Stop Growing.  Here's some of the original episodes.  And it's part of a series called My Shocking Story.  Yeah.  Some of the season one.  Half tree, half man.  We saw some of that.  World's fattest kids.  My big foot.  How big was that lady's foot, by the way?  It was ridiculous.  It wasn't even that it was just big.  Because it was giant.  She had a foot.  It was ridiculously big.  But it was crusty and pussy. 
[00:09:30]  And there were folds in her leg where her leg had gotten fat and expanded that they were  pulling like wadding out of because they have to drain it.  Oh, it was disturbing to watch.  You know those crunch balls at the gym?  She had one of those attached to her.  It was basically around her ankle mostly, right?  Yeah, but then up top it got really bad, too.  And her foot itself, the foot.  Yeah.  The toes looked like moldy fruit in a little bowl on your kitchen table. 
[00:10:00]  They were furry.  And you're right.  The names are great.  My Big Foot.  And then some of the season one stories from my shocking story.  Man with no face.  There you go.  And then this season you got Coma, Miracle, Burnt and Survived.  Which Sex Am I?  World's Heaviest Man.  Reconstruct My Face.  Can't Stop Growing. 
[00:10:30]  That's the one I saw, which was just...  Burnt and Survived.  Oh.  Can we get the preview clip on onaradio.com with the lady with the huge legs?  And when you see it, please call the show and scream and do whatever you have to to get  it out.  Get it out of your system.  Yeah.  You mentioned, too, which was interesting.  What was one of the first ones you just mentioned?  You mentioned a couple of them.  Like Burnt and Survived.  It was one right before Burnt and Survived.  Coma, Miracle.  Yeah.  What was that?  I don't know yet.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I would assume...  We got three more episodes left of this My Shocking Story on the Learning Channel, which 
[00:11:00]  is, of course, the P.T. Barnum channel.  See, that's what we did as a society.  We all love to look at this stuff.  But the nerds have decided that that's politically incorrect to pay a fee and go behind a curtain  and go, oh, my God, you're a freak.  Yeah.  So instead, we put it on TV and we make believe we're learning about this stuff.  That's it?  Yeah.  It's all the same.  We just want to look at this.  Hey, Spike in Boston, what's up?  Hi, boys. 
[00:11:30]  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you, Spike.  Thank you.  Why do they always have to show the little kids in there?  You know what I mean?  That just ruins it for everything.  I know.  And you kind of feel bad at that point.  Well, they had a kid on the show, which I was bored with because she's like three and  she already has like a big forehead.  And she's got a Jay Leno chin going.  And she's got like, she already has her adult teeth and the dentist is like, wow, she's way  ahead of schedule.  That's not good.  That's the least of a problem. 
[00:12:00]  She's got a bone in her ear that just grew to a point where she can't hear anymore.  So then they have to take that bone out.  But because of this disease, the bone's going to grow back.  It's a guarantee.  The hell is that?  They can't even figure out what this disease is.  They say it's not even what?  What?  Hereditary.  They don't know why this happens.  And only 200 people have it.  But Spike, that kid last night, I looked at it and I said, who would love that?  Yeah.  I know.  No one.  Only a mother would love that.  But the parents love the kid like unconditionally. 
[00:12:30]  And I'm looking like, who would love that?  Come on.  No, boy.  It's a burden.  It's a freak.  All right.  Let's have this disease.  Yeah.  Aw.  What do you got?  Penis joke coming up.  Let's go to Mike in Boston.  Mikey.  Yeah, there was another freak on TV last night.  It was on Medical Miracles or whatever.  It was on Channel 4 or 7 during the Olympics.  It was a 6'8 kid. 
[00:13:00]  He got all his teeth taken out.  His neck was, I don't know, five feet long.  It was ridiculous.  The guy didn't open his eyes.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Yeah.  It was another freak show on channels while the Olympics was on with diving.  I'm not a fan of the medical community because when I was growing up and you saw these freaks,  you're like, wow, that's cool.  But they're starting to cure a lot of this stuff.  You know, that giantism thing, it's the pituitary gland.  They could, like, stop that from happening to you.  Yeah.  It's not a giant thing. 
[00:13:30]  Guys, it's the first case is 12th chromosome is flipped around.  He's the only kid like it.  He cannot stop growing.  He will not stop growing.  It's still the one case.  You guys got to look it up and see this freak.  All right.  We will.  They're also figuring it out genetically.  Yeah.  And then they also figure it out, like, where they do tests during the pregnancy and then,  you know, there's a problem.  Yeah.  They have it figured out.  It's called Planned Parenthood.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  It's the old Hoover.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  Johnny.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Good morning.  Good morning.  I was watching that show last time.  My girlfriend says to me, yo, how come you couldn't have a hair in that spot?  I almost died.  Are you kidding me?  Why would she want you to have a hand that size?  You saw the size of that person's hand?  It was friggin' enormous.  My girlfriend's kind of a freak guy.  Sorry about that.  Oh, okay.  She would like you to have a big hand?  I'm thinking your girl would say, why can't your you-know-what be that big? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, right, like elephantitis or something.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  I'm at work.  You two are perfect for each other.  Wow.  You get the first one of these today.  Boo!  Sorry, bud.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Hey, we got audio of my big foot.  Just a little taste.  Vicky suffers from a rare...  By the way, if you don't think this is like PT Barnum freak stuff, listen to the music and how they present it.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  We're not learning...  Overly dramatic.  We're not learning anything.  They're trying to get the, oh, my God, emotion out of us.  Vicky suffers from a rare extreme case of lymphedema and abnormal swelling of the tissues.  Her leg, untreated, has swollen to 102 centimeters and weighs 39 kilos.  This is one of the largest leg lymphedemas in America.  She takes a cocktail of medication, including painkillers, which causes her to slow her speech sometimes.  Apparently, some kind of bacteria got in here.  I've been on antibiotics. 
[00:15:30]  Bacteria, like, sees my leg and says, oh, hey, that's horny.  I like it.  It's all...  Aw, she's got a good sense of humor about it.  I'm getting a whiff of it now.  A whiff?  What?  Did she say I'm getting a whiff of it now?  Oh, God.  That's got us.  Did she say that?  Yeah, I think she did.  Get out of here.  Let me eat it.  Because I'm eating, and this is really grossing me out.  It was hard for me to eat.  I was eating in the office before the show.  Were you eating giant leg of lamb?  Yes.  Giant, furry, gone bad leg of lamb. 
[00:16:00]  A turkey.  And it was green.  She had this green and yellow pussy stuff all over her foot and in the folds.  Oh, my God.  And her toes looked like rotting, furry grapes.  Ew.  Can we get her to squeeze some of that stuff out into a glass for Pat Duffy?  Dude, I stopped looking when the doctor said, okay, we're going to start draining this.  And I was like, no way am I going to be able to watch her pour what looks like Bavarian cream out of this lady's leg.  Bacteria, like, sees my leg and says, oh, hey, let's party. 
[00:16:30]  I like it.  It's an awful smell to it.  You're probably getting a whiff of it now.  Probably.  You might be getting a slight, as the camera guy is puking, you might get a slight whiff.  So my leg has an awful smell to it.  Yeah.  My leg has an awful smell.  Yeah.  Bacteria smell.  Nice.  Like a scab.  You ever smell like the underside of a scab?  No.  Why?  Stop what you do. 
[00:17:00]  If it comes off too soon, it's just got that healing wound smell.  Why do you smell it?  Why not?  It's only the bigger scabs.  I start, like, I make a weird face and I start, like, drooling.  And I go, I can't look at that.  And I have to wrap it up in a tissue and throw it away.  Sounds healthy.  Like scabs or boogies.  Yeah.  Hey, we have one more clip.  Disgusting.  We have one more clip of Vicky.  I got to rush through this because we're now heading toward a break.  But more of my Bigfoot and Vicky. 
[00:17:30]  Vicky's leg has been gradually growing since she was a child.  She was a very active teenager and lived a normal life despite her leg swelling as she got older.  She was a punk.  Vicky and her mother are convinced her condition was triggered by a dresser falling on her foot when she was two.  Oh, stop.  One day I heard a big noise and I came in and your little baby shift probe dresser was on top of you.  You didn't seem to be hurt too much.  But, you know, maybe a week or so later, I just couldn't put your shoe on. 
[00:18:00]  And I noticed that there was a swelling.  I think something happened when the dresser fell on you.  Couldn't put on your shoe.  In my wildest dreams, I never, never, never thought it would get like it is now.  And I prayed for 46 years that we could do something about it.  Well, so much for praying.  That didn't work very well, did it?  God was busy doing something else.  I'm sorry.  Good for you.  Sorry for you.  Dan, Long Island, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Owen, I love you guys.  Thank you, sir.  I went to high school with a kid and his right arm, like he had a normal left arm, but his right arm almost touched the ground. 
[00:18:30]  I had to sit next to this kid and one day I dropped my pencil and I actually asked him to grab it.  And then I thought, oh, I was like, wow, I must have made an ass of myself, you know?  Because I wasn't one of the kids that made fun of him. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  No, you were one of the good kids.  Invite him to the parties and everything.  Yeah.  No, definitely not.  Jimmy, I got a quick question for Jimmy, actually.  Okay.  Did you ever do open for a ventriloquist named Vince D'Antonio and George?  Yeah, like Vince is a buddy of mine.  I haven't seen him in years.  He was a Vietnam guy.  I heard he used to be a tunnel rat in Vietnam.  Wow, really?  I think so, yeah.  Wow, what about him?  He's actually my dad.  I was talking to him last night.  Oh, man, I like Vince.  Tell him I said hello.  Good thing. 
[00:19:30]  Thank God you said good things about him.  It would have been embarrassing.  Am I right, though?  That guy's an idiot.  He should not have kids.  That guy was a hack.  Wait, was he a hack?  He blew people behind the comedy club.  Jeez.  Sorry.  Sorry, Jimmy.  It's fine.  Am I right?  Is that what he did in Vietnam?  Yeah, he was a tunnel rat and a point man.  And he used to go into the tunnels with a .45 and a flashlight, and he'd crawl in there  and exterminate pretty much.  I want to talk to one of those tunnel rats. 
[00:20:00]  Those guys were absolutely insane.  Yeah, Vince did that.  And he's like the nicest guy on earth.  He's actually a great ventriloquist.  Tell your father I said hello, man.  He was a really nice dude.  Oh, I'll tell him tomorrow.  You guys have a tunnel rat talk.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Dan.  See you, buddy.  I wonder if he did that, like in the tunnels.  He'd just, you know, kind of throw his voice out of the side.  And Charlie would be like, where's that coming from?  And then he'd just shoot him.  Hey, I'm over here.  I'm over here.  Just blammo.  That's when he discovered he could do that whole thing.  Yeah, it's a great trick. 
[00:20:30]  For pure survival.  He threw his voice around those tunnels.  So listen, we've got to take our first break.  We're off to a great start.  And we're going to do some Google bombing after the break.  My God.  I think we found the hottest woman on the planet.  No joke.  And she's an Olympian.  No joke.  I think she's the hottest woman on the planet.  Or right up there.  And that's the picture I want you to put up on onaradio.com.  Shirley Hemple.  Because that shows her hotness.  We'll tell you who I think is the hottest woman I've seen in a long time. 
[00:21:00]  What's up on onaradio.com?  We got the video yet?  No, we have a dead web right now.  Dead web.  Yes, we have no internet.  What?  Which is very disturbing.  And I can't get my pal talk up.  And I can't research anything.  I can't go to IMDB.  I can't do anything.  You don't have pal talk?  No.  I've got nothing.  That means we have you today.  That's good.  Yes.  That means we're going to have a focusing Anthony today.  I will watch and pay attention to the show and what is said by everybody. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  I'm still enjoying the Shirley Hemple reference.  Yeah.  Like of all the ugly women you could have picked.  He reached back in 1977.  Oh, why not?  Yanks that monster out.  I'm happy.  You know?  Why not?  Yes.  She, to me, was the epitome of the ugliest woman on the face of the earth.  She was awful.  Shirley Hemple.  All right.  But soon on onaradio.com, we're going to have tree trunk, huge foot woman from London, right?  Wait till you see this video.  I really don't think we did it justice. 
[00:22:00]  But like that one caller said, her feet look like they're in garbage bags, black garbage bags.  They're that big.  I'm telling you.  Disgusting.  All right.  Lots to do.  And wow.  News coming out about Christina Applegate today.  Just amazing.  I'm so depressed right now.  Amazing.  We'll talk about that after the break, too.  O.P. and Anthony.  Good morning, peeps.  And I want to throw out a booyah, too.  A booyah.  A soft booyah, because it's early. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And a good morning to the peeps.  Peeps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  O.P. and Anthony.  877-212-ON-A.  I say stupid a lot, but our internet is down and we're not happy about it.  We got a lot of things to put on onaradio.com.  Yeah.  We got pictures of certain people we want to pop up there.  Yep.  You know, some Olympians.  Mm-hmm.  Some Olympic athletes.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  That we want to pop up there, but we can't.  Apparently there's a...  And we also want to show you that God has a sense of humor.  Yeah.  Because you've got these hot Olympic athletes.  And then you just throw the DNA and mix it around a little bit differently.  And then you get freak shows.  Yeah.  You get the woman with the giant feet and the giant legs.  Giant smelly bacteria foot.  Oh, well, that's Bigfoot.  Yeah.  I have a Bigfoot.  By the way, huge props to the pranksters that had everyone thinking they found Bigfoot in 
[00:23:30]  the dumpster.  Oh, is that ridiculous?  Stupid media.  Dumb media.  Was it a prank?  Yeah.  It was a good one, though.  They jump on anything.  Yeah.  Could this be Bigfoot?  And what did it turn out to be?  I don't know.  Like a costume.  It was a gorilla suit.  But they were smart enough to get some pig intestines or something.  Yeah, yeah.  They put some meat in there.  Throw it all in there.  Freeze the whole mess up.  And that got people talking. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  They submitted for a DNA test, too, or something.  So that kind of kept the story going.  Because then people were like, why would they if it was fake?  Did they ever figure out what that stupid thing was on the beach or something?  Yeah, the Montauk monster was...  Montauk monster.  What the hell was it again?  Raccoon or something?  Raccoon, right?  Oh, raccoon.  That's the Montauk monster.  Right.  Raccoon.  Yeah.  The media.  So give us a little time and we'll have onaradio.com update with some great, great visuals. 
[00:24:30]  You've got to see the video of the woman with the huge feet.  Well, the big foot.  Yeah.  And then the lady with the huge legs and feet.  Whoa.  That just stops.  I like that.  All right.  That's scary.  I want to thank Travis.  I gave Travis a gold star this morning.  Aw.  Just one, though.  One gold star for Travis.  What did he do?  Well, I was reading his email that he sends out to everybody every night.  You might want to take a look at that every once in a while there.  I look.  And he turns me on to this javelin thrower. 
[00:25:00]  And she could be the hottest woman in the world.  Yeah, she's from Paraguay.  Yeah.  Her name, and I want everyone to Google bomb the hell out of this one.  Her name is L-E-R-Y-N.  Is it L-E-R-Y-N?  That's L-E-R-Y-N.  L-E-R-Y-N?  L-E-R-Y-N?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  L-E-R-Y-N?  But she's from another country. 
[00:25:30]  It could be L-E-R-Y-N.  L-E-R-Y-N.  Last name Franco.  L-E-R-Y-N-F-R-Y-N-C-O.  Yes.  Google bomb L-E-R-Y-N-F-R-Y-N-C-O.  Wow.  And we're going to put the pictures up on onaradio.com in a little while.  How come there's no outrage?  What do you mean?  Shouldn't there be outrage?  I don't know.  Her and then that other one that does the crossbow or something?  Oh, the naked crossbow?  And she's got some hardcore stuff out there. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Where's the outrage?  It's like, oh, the Olympic athletes, they're role models for our children.  Well, this one's just a model.  I mean, she's showing some.  You're not seeing the naughty parts on Learn Franco.  L-E-R-Y-N.  Google bomb the hell out of that.  Number one on Google Trends today, baby.  I think some people might be offended and upset, though.  She's in her undies.  Weren't a couple of guys thrown out of the Olympics or something for that?  A couple of guys thrown off a team for doing something in their underwear or something? 
[00:26:30]  I don't remember.  Really?  It was not long ago.  A little goofy?  No.  It was like some gay posing or modeling or something?  Moo.  I don't know.  They were asked not to come?  Too sexy?  I don't know.  Not the issue I got.  Well.  LOL.  Yeah, so one star.  Just because, you know, Travis, this is more of a visual, and we do a radio show.  That's why the one gold star today.  We'd love to link it to the website.  Yeah, especially the shot where she's holding a towel up to her boobies, and she still has 
[00:27:00]  her bikini red bottoms on.  Yeah, very artistic.  Yeah, very, very nice.  With the big loop on the hip, all the young broads are going with that look.  The young broads.  Yes.  What do you got, Travis?  Oh, here he comes.  It takes Travis so long to get to the mic.  I love how he takes his time.  You've got to learn how to hustle, my friend.  I have tiny legs.  I can't stride that far.  Yeah, girlish.  She's actually done a calendar, and I would love to show you the pictures, but we don't  have internet.  She's got a whole calendar out?  Yes.  Could someone send the Learn Franco calendar to us? 
[00:27:30]  We want to put that up in our office.  So we'll look at that as soon as we get the internet.  That'll be our official calendar.  So that's audience participation.  You're going to have to Google that and check it out for yourself.  Do it yourself.  L-E-R-Y-N Franco.  F-R-A-N-C-O.  Just amazing.  And by the way, she's out of the Olympics.  She came in fourth place.  Fourth?  Yeah.  She's a javelin thrower.  But she gets a gold medal in my book.  Oh, huddle, huddle. 
[00:28:00]  How does a chick that hot get into javelin throwing?  I don't know.  I'd love the background story on that.  Why wouldn't you just be a model?  Yeah, because that's what she is.  She's got a great portfolio.  Yeah.  And I guess on YouTube, there's a nice montage of her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's going to take over the world, this one.  This one is-  Literally?  Yeah, I think so.  Sure.  Okay.  It's about time a hot broad takes over the world.  She should probably realize she should throw the dravel after about five dates in a row  and start screaming in pain in the car at the end. 
[00:28:30]  Not with the right arm again.  She gets a big mitt full.  Maybe I should do something.  Just launch it out the window.  Maybe I should do something with this talent I just discovered.  Yeah, she is quite attractive.  All right.  Jared in Boston.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Hottest one ever.  Learn rules.  L-E-R-Y-N.  Google that.  Google file that.  Isn't that Lorin?  I don't know.  L-E-R-Y-N. 
[00:29:00]  Now we're going with Lorin?  L-E-R-Y-N.  I'm going with Lauren or Lorine.  I like to-  Lauren.  Let's say that.  I'm thinking the Y might be silent.  I would bet any amount of money it's not learn.  I was trying to do it phonetically so people could find her.  Lorine.  Because a lot of these people, they're trying to remember the spelling as they drive, and  then they get to work, and they're like, oh!  I forgot it. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  That's why.  L-E-R-Y-N.  Put in piece of ass javelin thrower.  Lorine.  I'm sure.  Lorine.  I was going with Lorraine?  Lorraine.  Lorine.  Hey, moving on, because we don't have a TV show.  I mean, we could just spend-  You mind, Lorraine?  There's some news coming out this morning about Christina Applegate.  We heard she had the breast cancer.  We heard it was like a minor thing, right?  They caught it very early. 
[00:30:00]  Caught it very early, and we thought it wasn't going to be too invasive that they were going  to take care of her.  Well, the front page of the paper today, they took both her boobs.  Double mastectomy.  Christina Applegate had both her boobs removed.  That's just amazing.  She said that 100%, the breast cancer was 100% gone.  Well, that's kind of encouraging.  They must have really got early, but she has a gene.  Yeah.  They tested her, and they found out she has a gene where basically the odds are strong 
[00:30:30]  that it's going to come back in a really bad way, too.  Anyway, from 55% to 85% chance of it coming back, her mother died of it, so she opted to  just have both breasts removed instead of having to be checked out every four months and perhaps  having to deal with the cancer again, so she said she made a very tough decision and had both 
[00:31:00]  her breasts removed.  That is unbelievable.  Wow.  Damn.  That is unbelievable.  Let's just have two moments of silence there because that girl, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Not even that old, right?  You know, you watch, no, you know, you watch Married with Children and, wow.  She's not 40.  She's older than me.  I mean, I'm 40.  Is she really? 
[00:31:30]  No, come on.  No, I don't think so.  How old is Christina Applegate?  Stunt brain.  Stunt brain.  You know what?  It's not stunt brain.  It's stunt computer.  Yeah.  What happened to your brain?  How about the 3D iPhone?  Oh, wait.  I have it right here.  Look it up on your new iPhone.  That's a good idea.  Wait, Anthony makes a good point.  This guy doesn't have a brain.  He's a stunt computer.  He's just quick with the fingers on a computer.  You're like the Wizard of Oz.  Right.  We all think you're so smart and everything, but it's the machine.  No attention to that man Googling. 
[00:32:00]  Man, we could all do what you do.  I only thought this knowledge was in the actual brain of you.  Stunt brain.  Yeah, stunt brain means it's already in there.  It's a stunt laptop.  Yeah.  He's Mike the Fool without his computer.  Mike the Fool.  Stunt fast hyper.  I will guess she's 39 years old.  All right.  See?  A little younger.  Wow, Jimmy.  A little younger than you.  God.  That's Mike's guess.  I would have...  1971, Steve confirmed she was born.  Yes.  37.  Yeah.  She'll be 37.  All right.  Jimmy was close, though, man.  I'm 37. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, that's even younger.  Hey, what a shame.  Let's go to Jessica in New York.  Jessica?  Hi.  Hi.  I was actually calling to let you guys know that it's Lerine Franco.  Lerine.  Lerine.  My name is Lerine.  Even her name is hot.  Wow.  Say that again.  It is, actually.  It sounds much hotter when you...  It's Lerine Franco.  Oh.  Are you...  You got a little of that in you there, Jessica?  Well, I'm Argentinian.  So it's...  Oh, so it's Jessica.  That's Paraguay. 
[00:33:00]  And where is she from?  Paraguay or something like that?  It's pronounced...  Par...  Paraguay.  Par...  Paraguay.  Yeah, it's Paraguay.  Paraguay.  No, it's not.  It's Paraguay.  And why does she have such an awful last name, Franco?  I don't know.  You do the first name and I'll do the last name.  Go ahead, Jessica.  All right.  Lerine.  Franco.  Franco.  That's the worst.  Yeah, it's pretty much the worst. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  She's probably dating some Olympian type guy or...  I like Jessica's little raspy, smokes-too-much voice.  I like it.  I like it.  It's more of the waking up way too early voice.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, it's the Jim Norton just got out of surgery voice.  Hi.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  By the way, Stephen S. from Bayshore, his first instant feedback, worth reading today.  He's already sent in 100.  But I'll go with this one, Stephen S. 
[00:34:00]  Wow.  An insult.  Oh, great.  We now live in a world where Stalker Patty has a better rack than Christina Applegate.  So, oh, wow.  Let's go with Stephen, Connecticut.  Steve.  That's a sad truth.  Steve.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Hey.  What's happening, fellas?  Hey, Christina Applegate, she's just doing what most people do with preventive maintenance  there.  You know, if they're going to get cancer, they'll have to worry about it the rest of their life.  They'll rather have a double mastectomy than have that worry over their head forever. 
[00:34:30]  Look, there was a 150% increase in women who have decided to have both breasts removed.  Really?  150% increase.  Probably because of the advancements in, like, fake breasts.  It's like, you're going to lose it anyway.  You might as well get them made nice.  They can make perfect-looking implants.  Yeah, and they can tell by genetic testing that, you know, you're predisposed to this.  So, instead of having to deal with it.  That's exactly why all the women do it. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but see, we're not women.  Like, that's got to be just a horrendous decision to make.  Well, I was talking to my wife last night, and it'd be like somebody, you know, neutering  you.  It's your manhood, and that's their womanhood.  So, it's got to be devastating that way.  Yeah, I know someone that had a double done, and a really hot girl, but she's recovering.  She had, like, she was, like, on the mend, I guess, for a long time, and then she had,  I think she had implants before.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, she's like, I think she's doing well.  God bless. 
[00:35:30]  Yes.  At least, you know, she's still a good-looking woman.  She's still a sexy girl, and now we'll get to look at her a little longer.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Look at you making lemonade.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  Watch it out.  Jesus.  And because I haven't said it in a while, Lauren.  Wow.  How did she say that?  Larine.  Larine.  Larine.  Larine Franco.  We're Google-bombing today.  L-E-R-Y-N.  Franco.  Yeah.  The hottest Olympian.  I don't think there's a hotter one.  No.  Although, there is a sluttier one. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  That crossbow chick.  Wow.  Totally naked.  That crossbow chick had a little bit of a mustache, too, didn't she?  She was almost.  In that one picture you showed me.  Oh, why don't you punch it up on the, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The weave.  Oh, there she is.  Okay.  Oh, thank you, E-Rock.  See, look at this.  I'm digging this.  Actually, she's pretty hot in black and white.  Sweetest crossbow chick.  What's her name?  Sarah Baberg?  Baberg?  I can't read your writing there, E-Rock.  I think it's B-O-B-E-R-G, Sarah. 
[00:36:30]  Sarah Baberg.  Sarah without the H there.  She's Swedish?  Swedish crushbow-er.  I'll say she's sweet.  She's not Swedish.  She's...  Ha, ha, ha.  Get it?  Yeah.  I did it.  I got that one.  I really got that one.  Boo.  She looks pretty good there.  Well, she's...  I think she's hotter because she's naked.  Well.  The numbers go up because she's naked. 
[00:37:00]  Does help.  Wa-wa-wa-wa.  Yeah, wa-wa-wa.  Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.  Yeah.  What do you think of Sarah there?  Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.  Yeah.  Wow.  Very nice.  Look at that last picture.  Well...  That's showing some...  Hmm.  Everything.  Yeah.  She's leaning back on the bed.  That's a great pose, isn't it?  Mm-hmm.  Just put the old napkin on.  Wrap it around your neck like an old-time guy at a diner. 
[00:37:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's funny.  You walk into the room, there's lobster bibs on the dresser.  Wow-we.  No, it's not wow-we.  Wow-we.  It's, uh, Whoa-wa-wa-wa-wa.  Yeah.  It's Whoa-wa-Wee-wa, Jimmy.  Come on.  Oh, no.  You cannot go there.  No, no.  But can, um...  He's terrible.  I hate to do this, but could Stunt Brain take away the naked pictures from everybody? 
[00:38:00]  It just shuts down the show.  It really, you're right.  We haven't done anything in two minutes.  I'll take good care of them.  All right.  You can give it back to us during the break.  Here.  Here, take mine, too.  I wouldn't be able to use those pictures.  No, are you kidding me?  No?  No.  She's hot, believe me, but no.  That last one?  You can't.  You need.  What?  No, you wouldn't be able to use that?  That would.  In a pinch?  To finish?  No way.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:38:30]  Danny's saying, what's wrong with you guys?  What do you need?  You guys have desensitized yourself.  I'm so with Jimmy on this one, where it's just like when you've seen the things that  you search out and look for nowadays to do that to, just a simple picture like that is  totally not getting the job.  No, I think it still works.  I think some of the basic stuff still works.  You're like Nicholson in the end of Carnal Knowledge, where it's just he can't do anything  because he's just so twisted sexually and needs this stimuli that just has to be so out there. 
[00:39:00]  Like maybe if I hadn't done that in like a week or something or two, a couple weeks,  but definitely not on like if, from the things that I look at just on a daily basis,  I couldn't just take that and be fine with that.  See, picture plus a little fantasy thing.  That works fine.  That can work.  It's, you don't have to, I don't need videos of all kinds of wacky three ring circus. 
[00:39:30]  You don't have to explain some of that innocent stuff is beyond hot.  You guys need your videos to all end with the aristocrats.  That's like, Jesus.  No, the innocent stuff would only turn me on if it was a girl that I'd wanted to see naked.  Like if it was something taboo about it, like, oh my God, that's that chick I went to high school with  and here she's posing naked.  That might do it for me.  No, see, I could look at that last picture and completely start imagining what that would be like to do certain things. 
[00:40:00]  And, and the, the, the picture plus the mental stimulation like that, that'd work fine.  I envy you.  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I'm too far gone for that.  That's sorry.  You want to watch?  Do it right now.  No.  No.  All right.  We got a break.  We got a break.  877-212-ON-A.  We don't have ONARadio.com working right now.  We got some great updates, so.  Our intertubes aren't working.  Yeah.  Keep checking ONARadio.com.  A lot of visuals going up there today.  Just because we can, one more time, we got Ernest Borgnine talking about why he's still 
[00:40:30]  alive at 91.  Okay.  We're just going to play a cold going into a break here.  Check it out in case you missed it.  To the show show.  But real quickly, you're 91 years old.  You look fantastic.  You look like you're in your late 60s, early 70s.  What's the secret?  I don't dare tell you.  No meat.  You don't eat meat.  I masturbate a lot.  Okay.  I think.  Thank you, Ernie.  That was great. 
[00:41:00]  I actually heard that.  Ernie, have you ever been on YouTube?  Listen, listen, yesterday, yesterday.  What are you talking about?  I like this guy.  Okay.  We're going to take a quick time out.  You'll be in the after the show show.  Come on down to FoxandFriends.com.  I just shook his hand.  I want to say happy birthday to Robert Plant. 
[00:41:30]  What?  We don't do birthdays unless it's someone important.  Yeah.  Guess how old Robert Plant is today.  64.  Really?  I have no idea.  When I'm 61.  Nah.  He's not that old.  He's the big 6-0.  6-0.  Robert Plant's 60.  What happened?  What the F is.  What the.  Hold up.  It's called time.  What?  Just ticks on.  Tick tock.  60? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  What?  I thought he was older, actually.  Really?  Yeah.  That's telling me what I thought.  He's starring in the late 60s, so I guess you're right.  Maybe he's, you know.  He's padding.  He's padding a little bit, right?  Yeah.  Could be.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now, we wanted to move on.  Everyone is Google bombing the hell out of, how do you say her name again?  Lurine?  Lurine.  Lurine.  Lurine.  Lurine.  Lurine Franco.  L-E-R.  Paraguay.  Y-N. 
[00:42:30]  Franco.  Paraguay.  We think she's one of the hottest girls ever.  Mm-hmm.  And then E-Rock runs in with naked pictures, and we're really trying to get away from the  naked pictures so we can try to, like, entertain these people out there.  Well, we got-  Because naked pictures just stop the show.  Yeah.  Always.  We got that because there's that crossbow chick-  Yeah.  From the Olympics that was naked.  Yeah.  So, we got those pictures, and it pretty much just, you know, it stops the show immediately.  Wa-wa-wee-wa.  Yes.  Yes, of course. 
[00:43:00]  It was quite the wa-wa-wee-wa.  Very nice.  Very nice.  And that stopped the show.  Uh-huh.  And now, what the hell are these?  Well, it's three German Olympic athletes completely naked.  Oh, God.  And we are looking at the greatest heinie ever.  The greatest heinie ever.  Wa-wa-wee-wa.  Yes.  The greatest heinie ever.  Oh, my goodness.  What is she- what sport does she do? 
[00:43:30]  Well, I can think of a couple.  Wow.  Wa-wa-wee-wa.  What?  Yes.  Yes.  What a cute face.  You know, I enjoy a cute face, but in this case, it's all about the heinie, my friend.  My only flaw with her is she's- her breasts are really nice, but her body's almost a little  too athletic.  Like, when you look at her torso- and I'm not being nitpicky.  I'm just saying, like, that's the only flaw she has is there's, like, a little too wide 
[00:44:00]  a torso.  Her breasts are a little too small.  If they were a little bigger, she'd look better.  But aside from that, she's a perfect girl.  So, man, you're tough to please.  No, I'm not.  No, no.  You kidding me?  No.  I'm only saying I just noticed that one shot.  Believe me, I'd kill family members for her.  And by the way, back when we were saying before about the nude, innocent pictures, I had a  picture one time of a girl who I was friends with.  And it happened to be- it was a goof shot I took up her skirt.  And she was wearing panties.  And they were pulled aside a teeny bit. 
[00:44:30]  A little bit.  Okay.  Just enough to show a teeny bit.  And I can't tell you the damage I did.  Look at that photo.  But it was because it was somebody who I knew, who I had known for years.  And it was, like, a goof shot.  You know, I hadn't seen her in a long time.  But there was a story.  Oh, you hit pay dirt with the goof shot, didn't you?  I really- I was kind of trying to annoy her.  You know, we were sitting at a club.  Annoyer.  Oh, boy.  You know, just-  I didn't think anyway.  Yeah.  I got an idea for the show.  We should- the whole staff, including a stunt who's good at a computer. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Instead of stunt brain.  The whole staff has to come in and show the rest of the staff what they used the last  time they scrapped.  That's great.  It's great.  Mm-hmm.  We already have it here, though.  Huh?  Two girls, one cup.  Well, one by one, everyone's got to be very honest and go, all right, this is what I used, 
[00:45:30]  and then kind of show the rest of us what it was.  And I think there's going to be a fine variety of things.  Okay.  Yeah.  I say we do that.  What if it changes by tomorrow?  Uh-huh.  By tomorrow.  Now we're all going to be careful.  How about this?  Not the last thing you used, but the last thing before you said that, because now everybody  knows we have to bring it in tomorrow.  We're all going to scrap to something nice.  I think these guys have been around long enough to know, all right, I'm not going to  cheat or anything.  Well, I don't know how embarrassing it is.  Believe me, I would cheat.  Yeah.  The problem is, I'd have to bring in a live person. 
[00:46:00]  Wah-wah-wee-wah.  Just carry someone in.  Wah-wah-wee-wah.  Yeah.  Well, maybe Iraq should tell the fine folks where they could see these girls naked from  the German Olympic team.  Not at my house.  Why not at your house, Steve?  Because I don't think we can link these anywhere.  Steve?  Why won't they be nuded to your house?  Oh, God, I hate him on the air.  Why do you do this?  Why wouldn't they be, though? 
[00:46:30]  I enjoy that.  All right?  There it is.  It's almost an art, isn't it?  I really have to think about it.  I really have to think about not saying anything.  It really is almost an art.  The complete lack of improvisational skills.  I am Picasso.  Thanks, Steve.  Oh, I love it.  Why won't we want it?  Iraq, where can you find these? 
[00:47:00]  What?  Just Google German Olympic Playboy, and those photos come up.  Yeah, the perfect tiny.  Can I plug something that you always say I should plug?  I never do.  I'm doing Fox tonight.  Fox Red Eye.  Red Eye.  And my mustache is going, but I'm just keeping it for tonight.  No.  So I will do TV with my mustache.  Wow.  You've got to make it to Friday with your mustache.  What's today?  Wednesday?  Yeah, you've got a few more days there, Jimmy.  Can I do it until Friday?  Maybe I can.  Come on.  Yeah.  For old time's sake. 
[00:47:30]  For old time's sake.  The remixes are coming in.  Remember the guy snapping his elbow?  Oh, yes.  With the weightlifting.  Mm-hmm.  One of the better clips we've gotten in a while.  Do I have the raw clip here somewhere for the people?  I think I can find it.  Hold on a minute.  Give me a second.  Yes.  Give me a second.  All right.  I'm sure you'll come up with the...  This clip.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  Well, the remix are coming in.  My heart can't hear me.  My heart can't hear me. 
[00:48:00]  My heart can't hear me.  You change me in something that I just can't throw away.  You see me now.  Let's get out of my brain.  That your love is bringing back the other way.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  Hey, the German girls are online.  A fine website called whatwouldtylerdurdendo.com.  Basically, it's wwtdd.com.  They have them up there.  Oh, cool.  I've been on that site.  Is it?  I think they're fans of the show. 
[00:48:30]  I think they're fans of the show because they knew who Jimmy was when they put that picture  of Mandy Moore up in the background.  Is it when you see me coming, best get out of my way?  Yes, it is, actually.  Oh, okay.  What did you think it was?  When you see me coming, I thought it was just get out of my way.  Best get out of my way.  All right.  Cool.  This is why I love Anthony because people don't see this, that every day that he leaves  the studio, he's been walking down the hall going, get out of my way.  I can't get it out of my head. 
[00:49:00]  It is the catchiest song I've ever heard in my life.  Thank you so much.  That's exactly what I was going for.  It certainly panned out for you then because it's stuck in my head constantly at home.  You were thinking of it at home?  Yes.  I love it.  I can't stop.  I've got to figure out how to get it on iTunes.  You see me coming, best get out of my way.  I'm going to be singing that one again.  Can we get Steve out of the studio at least?  All right.  No.  Steve, you wrote a catchy one.  Thank you, Jimmy.  It was like 10 years ago, too. 
[00:49:30]  I'm very happy.  Yeah.  Where are you?  Boo.  Boo.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Bye, Steve.  Bye.  The studio door is swinging back the other way.  Bye, Steve.  You said it.  Hey.  Hey.  Another remix.  Louie.  Beans.  I want my money.  Oh, no.  You can't die for me forever.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  Louie.  Beans.  Louie.  Beans.  I forgot Louie.  Beans.  So those are coming in. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, God.  Which is wonderful.  Mars is here.  That means obviously we will have Internet in a matter of moments.  Right, Mars?  No.  What?  We're running retro here.  We're doing radio like they did in the old days, before the intratubes.  Actually talking into the mics.  Yes.  There's an area outage.  Oh, Jesus.  There's an area outage.  Yes.  Well, fix it.  For Roadrunner?  For Roadrunner.  How come?  Time Warner.  Yeah.  It is Time Warner.  Oh, boo.  And you know something?  I keep getting a from no service to full bars on my phone. 
[00:50:30]  Me too.  You too?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Something happened.  AT&T?  Come on.  American Telephone and Telegraph?  Could you take the last T off?  When was the last time the beep, beep, beep was relevant?  Make something else.  Technology.  I don't know.  This might be related to the interweb.  To the interweb.  It's to terrorism.  I think.  Cyber terrorists.  Yeah.  Hey.  I'm scared. 
[00:51:00]  Lorin or whatever her name is.  Larin.  We got her up to nine so far in Google Trends.  Come on, guys.  Google bomb.  Yeah.  I think she's one of the hottest women I've seen in a long time.  She is a long time.  Lorin.  L-E-R-Y and Franco.  What's sex?  Larin.  Larin.  Larin.  Side picture.  Larin Franco.  Her little juicy thigh.  And you just see like the little plump rump.  And she's got a calendar we want to link on onaradio.com when the internet is back up and running.  And, you know, there's a few of the pictures. 
[00:51:30]  If you Google image here, you're going to go, eh.  Make sure you find the one with the red bathing suit bottom.  With the towel.  With the towel up to her boobies.  Yes.  Her bosom.  All right.  I was trying to think of a picture that I used to.  Scrap two.  Yeah.  I've gotten a few sent to me from, let's just say, some of our friends out there.  Godspeed.  Godspeed to you.  Over the years.  And you know what? 
[00:52:00]  Sometimes, you know, I've seen a lot of prostitutes.  That's common knowledge.  Yes.  And normally, there have been massage therapists I've seen who do not go to the place of having  sex.  They don't do it.  Right.  But they'll allow a little bit if they know you well.  They're really not hookers.  And those girls can get me where I need to go just by, like, allowing me to do things  while they just kind of brush their hands over my chest.  It's amazing how it really is all relative to your relationship with the person and who 
[00:52:30]  they are.  That can get me crazier than some of the girls that will come over and just do full service  for 200 bucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's amazing how it's like, because this person, and she's actually allowed me to do this,  it will turn me on more than had she just come over and done it the first time.  Because it wasn't assumed?  Yeah, exactly.  Because it's like, I know she's not a hooker because, you know, I offered her more money  and she wouldn't do it.  Wow.  I'm not thinking of anyone specifically, of course. 
[00:53:00]  Oof.  Had some good ones.  Hey, we started with this yesterday.  We want to play the beep game with something.  Oh, right.  McCain's wife has, like, I don't know, an injured arm because she was shaking hands.  Poor woman.  Yeah.  She got a horrible hand-shaking injury.  Yeah, and we had the story yesterday.  What the hell is that?  And the story itself is...  Graham cracker bones.  The story itself is whatever.  Mm-hmm.  But we have to play the story to set up the bleep game, because then Sam took it and put  a bunch of beeps in, and it's a much different story. 
[00:53:30]  Made it sound a little naughty, I bet.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, you shouldn't do that, because it's going to make it sound like she's saying something  dirty when she's not.  Yeah, I know.  Here's the original story.  Some politicians say it's an injury waiting to happen, and it happened to Cindy McCain  Wednesday when one supporter took things a little too far.  I'm absolutely fine.  And just, we had a great lunch and fundraiser, and I shook hands, and it was just a very enthusiastic  supporter.  Mrs. McCain had surgery for a wrist injury several years ago. 
[00:54:00]  Wednesday's firm handshake aggravated the injury and left her in a sling.  You know something?  She can't even be honest.  Well, you know, a supporter is good, you know, uh-huh, just an overzealous supporter  of ours.  She can't even go, this idiot came up to me and doesn't know how to shake hands and grabbed  my hand and squished it.  You know, be honest.  I'll tell you what that is.  It's because we're all so self-conscious now of giving women too soft a handshake, because 
[00:54:30]  when you shake a woman's hand, they're like, I hate when a guy doesn't shake my hand right.  I hate when a guy grabs my hand soft.  Just flop something in it.  So you, well, you know.  Here you go.  Shake this.  Shake that, toots.  That toots.  Shake that, and then towel off your forearm.  Hey, what's the worst name for a woman?  Is it toots or broad?  Or is there a better one out there?  The dirty one?  We've been pondering one dirty one that is now my favorite. 
[00:55:00]  Dirty one?  It's better than the C, I think, personally.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  It's the same thing that, yeah, there it is.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  You can't use that.  Limes would spit.  There you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we say that?  Yeah.  Sure.  All right.  It's what you would do to a piece of paper with a knife.  Sure.  You would make a, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, if you cut it.  You call it a carve?  Or you do it to your wrists if you're committing suicide. 
[00:55:30]  You're doing it to your wrists.  But when you use that as a derogatory term for a woman, it's, uh, yeah.  Let's do the top five today.  You got that one.  You got broad.  You got toots.  Such a good one.  Toots is a good one.  Toots is worse than broad.  I think there's toots.  Can we get a couple more in there?  Because toots almost has a subservient sexual innuendo to it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Come here, toots.  Hey, toots.  Nice.  Yeah, nice jugs, toots.  Toots.  Because Kenny used to do that, and we'd be on the road in Vegas, he'd, just to make  me laugh, he'd call the waitress, he'd go, excuse me, toots. 
[00:56:00]  Toots.  And it was so degrading.  And other people are uncomfortable, but he's just a lumbering ox and a mustache.  So nobody would say, excuse me, toots.  Toots.  Big dope.  Let's get back to the McCain story, McCain's wife, the second part of the story.  While some believe good handshaking could be considered an art form, experts say the  action should be taken seriously, because injuries on the campaign trail are actually  quite common.  So much so that the American Occupational Therapy Association devoted a whole campaign 
[00:56:30]  to helping people stay safe while meeting and greeting on the trail.  Keeping your elbow at a 90 degree angle is actually optimal.  Protecting the, you know, shoulder and back by not reaching forward and over things and  into crowds.  All right.  By the way, it did happen, too, and Bob Dole can testify that.  Ah, yes.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no, that's terrible. 
[00:57:00]  That's just awful.  Aye.  Aye, aye.  I tried to make that a joke by going, Bob Dole can testify.  If I were to, I should have just said Bob Dole, nothing, because I had nothing.  Seriously, folks.  Bank six could be my favorite.  There's a lot of good ones on this.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth, I will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket. 
[00:57:30]  Walking around.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Bucket's a drink.  Yeah.  Also on here?  The beer we have, it drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser, what is it?  Millen.  Millen.  Cool.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  You guys are going to be drowning.  Boom.  Boom.  I got to have this bank up more often, because this one's on there, too.  It was all over a beer.  They was up there.  They had a beer.  They didn't have no beer.  And they won a beer. 
[00:58:00]  They were hanging around to get a beer.  The mailman gave me a dollar.  I was just talking about it.  They were arguing over a beer.  They probably took this beer and then shot him.  You know.  Bank end.  It's awful.  It is punt.  It is just awful.  Yeah.  There's just some people in this world that, I don't know, on a whole nother level.  Hey, we got Brian Regan here.  We're going to get him in.  Brian.  In a few minutes. 
[00:58:30]  It's a matter of moments.  Yeah, we got to take a quick break.  But before we do, so we got the McCain thing.  The story you just heard.  Sam went into the other room and threw some beeps in it.  And let's see if it is a better story now.  Remember, she had the handshaking injury.  Yes.  Okay.  Some politicians say it's an injury waiting to happen.  And it happened to Cindy McCain Wednesday when one supporter took things a little too far.  I'm absolutely fine.  And just, we had a great lunch and fundraiser.  And I, I, a very enthusiastic supporter. 
[00:59:00]  Mrs. McCain had surgery for a b**** injury several years ago.  Wednesday's b**** aggravated the injury.  Not bad, right?  It sounds like she was having sex with the supporter.  Well, yeah.  That's what I heard.  And then, and then it continues.  While some believe good b**** could be considered an art form, experts say the action should be  taken seriously because injuries on the b**** are actually quite common.  So much so that the American b**** association devoted a whole campaign to helping people stay safe while b**** and b**** on the b****. 
[00:59:30]  That's a pretty good one.  I like those back-to-back ones.  And the belly-to-belly.  I got to back up.  You laughed over the, uh, some of the, some of the, some of the, some of the, some of the pain to helping people stay safe while b**** and b**** on the b****.  Keeping your, you know, your b**** at a 90-degree angle is actually optimal. 
[01:00:00]  Um, protecting the b**** by not reaching forward and over things.  Wow.  That is good.  That is a good one.  Bravo, Sam.  Bravo.  That works.  Ah.  A quickie before we go to break.  Can I tell you something awful?  Yeah, Jimmy.  Actually, it wrote Bob Goldown before, so I wouldn't forget to say it.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, that's, oh, no, that's terrible. 
[01:00:30]  That's just awful.  I just keep hitting refresh on the page.  It's like when you have a blackout at your house when, no, no, I don't mean that.  Stop it.  I mean the power failure.  No one thought you did it at your house.  The power failure.  I would, I would, I would suggest that Morris takes his time fixing this whole thing.  No, you keep, like, flipping switches on in your house.  You ever do that when the power goes out?  Yeah.  And you walk around and you flip the switch? 
[01:01:00]  Well, when the internet is out, you just kind of keep hitting refresh and go, come on,  page, load.  Come on.  Morris, take your time.  It's nice to have a well-focused Anthony today.  I am focused.  We have you today.  I am looking to get on CNN.com and Drudge Report.  Yeah, sure you are.  Which I prominently display.  Who do you think you're talking to?  On a daily basis.  14 years.  Who do you think you're talking to?  Hey, what is, we got a well-focused man and we're enjoying it.  When is Barack announcing his VP? 
[01:01:30]  Is it today?  They're saying it might be Biden.  No, Biden seems to have dropped out of the running.  Biden said he has no clue what anyone's talking about and he hasn't spoken to anybody.  Biden scares me, right?  Biden would have been a good pick for his foreign policy experience, but he's too far  out there for the rest of it.  There's a talk of this Kansas governor, Kathleen Sebelius.  Kathleen's a weird name for a guy, so that wouldn't work.  He was going with a woman?  That's what they're saying.  What a dummy!  And Nader has stepped up and said he believes it's going to be Hillary in a surprise. 
[01:02:00]  And we should hear any time tomorrow or Friday because there's a stump event scheduled  Saturday.  Oh, great.  So now that Heather Mills is involved.  He needs boring white guy.  Dude, he is a dummy.  If he doesn't pick, why does he take John Kerry, who did get 48% even though he was against  Bush?  Kerry's got too much negative crap behind him right now.  He'll be seen as a more, an older guy.  Yeah, but he's campaigned on this whole change agenda.  And if he brings in the old guard, he'll get hammered on that. 
[01:02:30]  And Kerry just looks like an elitist and a jackass.  But people are used to seeing his face publicly.  The people, he already ran for president.  Like Al Gore would be a good choice.  These are guys that have already run who people see as presidential.  He got 48% of the vote, I think, or 40-something percent.  He got a lot of votes already.  This dumbbell, if he does that, is he forgetting that a black president's a huge change?  I mean, it's fine, but it's a big change. 
[01:03:00]  Are they going to bring a woman in too?  So if something happens to you, now she's president?  Yes.  God, you're stupid.  It may or may not be Sibelius, but she's in the top running.  Evan Bayh was until they found out his wife had a bunch of problems with corporate boards  she's on that he's been slamming.  Oh.  You know, he's out.  So Bayh's out.  It still could be that guy, Kane, the governor from Virginia, a real boring guy.  But right now it looks like Sibelius or Kane, and Nader says it's Hillary.  You read up on a lot of boring stuff. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  You've got weird knowledge.  What about McCain?  McCain, we're still thinking it could be, what's his name from Massachusetts, Mitt Romney?  Yeah, they're talking Mitt Romney, who is a pro-choice Republican.  Yep.  Which is odd.  They think that's going to alienate a lot of the hard right and your base, your core constituency.  And the other two for him are Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security guy, the governor  from, what was it, Pennsylvania? 
[01:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  Or, um, there was one more choice, Lieberman, which would be a real wild card for him.  Yeah, Lieberman.  Lieberman would hurt him, right?  Yeah.  You've got Romney or a black guy.  Mitt Romney would be a good choice, I'm thinking.  Or a black guy?  Yeah, why not?  If there's a black conservative, why not?  That would, that would, people who might want to go conservative, they're like, eh, black  president will be nice.  Republican.  That kind of wipes out.  A Republican would never do that.  Like Condi Rice, maybe?  Yeah, I was thinking of her.  I said the guy, but I was thinking kind of of hers.  Close enough.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  We all heard.  She's guyish.  She plays the piano.  We all know what that means.  If he picked a black vice president, all I picture, and with all humor here, is two would-be  assassins, one black and one white, in a race to see who they can get to be put into the  presidency.  That's a reality show.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Brian Regan joins the program next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:05:00]  We almost went off the air.  No joke.  I grabbed my water, I thought the cap was on, and went flying.  Opie and Anthony, we got Brian Regan in studio.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, hey, guys.  Brian's back.  How are you?  Always good to have Brian Regan in.  He's a very busy gentleman, Brian. 
[01:05:30]  Got a lot going on.  There's an old sheet here with all kinds of stuff on him.  I'm embarrassed.  Where the hell are you going to be?  You're everywhere.  I think he's promoting an energy drink today.  Are you?  I don't know.  It's called Regan's.  You don't have to say all that stuff.  Oh, thank God.  Just, uh...  We only have an hour left in the show, Brian.  You know what?  Oh my God.  Just, you know, cut everything up, put it in a hat, and pull, you know, we'll just plug  one thing at random.  I think the big one is the special.  I don't know.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Because the Letterman is pretty big, too.  And then you've got the New York Comedy Festival.  There's a lot of big things on here, Brian.  Just by saying which ones you should comment on, you've just plugged three.  That's what I'm trying to do.  What do you think we should plug and then run through them all?  August 29th, he's on Letterman.  And then Comedy Central special, an hour special, September 7th at 10 o'clock.  Hey, that's cool.  And the DVD is out September 9th.  Happy for you.  Thank you.  It's actually September...  Jimmy, happy for you.  Special after special, DVD after DVD, Letterman after Letterman. 
[01:06:30]  It's always great news to see your friends.  Some acting subtext in there.  Yeah.  The special is actually September 6th, Saturday, that they're going to premiere.  They changed it yesterday or something.  Why'd they do that?  Well, because there's some type of awards thing on Sunday night or something.  And I definitely can't compete with anything like that.  Well, at awards, at the BET Awards, believe me, there'll be no crossover.  Or maybe the closing of the Olympics, maybe.  No, it's some type of award show that'll show you how much I know about the world I live in. 
[01:07:00]  Is it the Emmys?  No.  It can't be anything big.  Huh?  The Emmys are after.  Oh, okay.  The stunt brain is trying to get by without an internet.  Yeah.  But Brian, he's not that smart.  We just realized that.  We just realized that.  He looks smart to me.  No, his whole gig is he's stunt brain.  When your brain's not working, his does.  He jumps in like a stunt man jumps in for an actor.  Yeah.  Like, he's our brain if we need a stunt brain. 
[01:07:30]  And the head is just filled with so much knowledge that he has to call himself stunt brain.  Well, the computers went down today, Brian.  And guess what?  Old stunt brain.  He turned into Google guy is what we found out that he is.  Yeah.  He's quick on a keyboard guy.  Yeah.  Because now the internet's down here, and he's pretty much profoundly retarded now.  Oh, he stinks.  He really does.  He's just a dope. 
[01:08:00]  Almighty.  Are you watching the Olympics, Brian?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're fun, man.  Yeah?  They're like a swimmer or something did something good?  Yeah.  Apparently, you're one of those guys, right?  The country's made up of a lot of people obsessed with the Olympics, and then other people that  just can't be bothered.  Michael.  Yeah.  Michael Phelps.  Michael Phelps.  No, I've been watching.  I've actually been enjoying it.  I haven't watched the Olympics like in a long time, and this time I've been enjoying them.  Well, with Michael Phelps, we learned his motivation is that he just wants his dad to talk to him. 
[01:08:30]  Did he say that?  Well, it's obvious.  He won eight gold medals, and Dad's still going, nah, nah.  I still don't want to talk to you.  You couldn't get nine?  Right.  Just not satisfied with anything, Dad.  Because everyone's thinking, wow, why is he just that good, and why is he trying that hard?  He wants his dad's love, and he still doesn't have it.  Who's the boxer, the good-looking Latino guy that, uh, oh.  Oh, well, Brian.  I didn't know what Brian's type was. 
[01:09:00]  Latino boxers.  Looks like things have changed since last time, Brian.  Yeah, let's talk about him for a while.  That cute guy with the nice ass.  Who's that guy?  Well, what do you like about it, Brian?  You know, with the six-pack and the field-hand thighs.  Do you like his eight-pack?  Yeah.  What is it about him, Brian?  Let's get into it.  Hey, I'm glad we're on this subject.  Hey, can you get a picture of him?  Can you get a picture of him on the internet or something?  We can look at him.  Oh, Brian.  Oh, the internet.  See, this is what we... 
[01:09:30]  No, this guy had an issue with his dad, but I can't remember.  Well, that's wonderful, Brian, because this is what we've been looking at today.  Ah.  Yeah, yeah, naked German Olympic athletes.  Yeah, a lot of Olympic athletes, these women competing, they've posed nude.  Yeah.  Or semi-nude, and a lot of them are a lot hotter than the old days.  You know, you wouldn't want to see Olga Corbett, let's say, sprawled out on a bedspread.  Or Nadia Comaneci.  Nadia.  Or Comaneci.  Comaneci.  Yeah.  Well, we better look up this Latin boxer for Brian. 
[01:10:00]  We finally have internet.  Oh, do we?  That's wonderful.  The internet pops up just in time to see the Latin boxer.  Guess you're about to sound smart again.  Yeah.  Old stunt brain is plugged back in.  I got five bars.  Five bars, nice.  Yeah.  Think of the boxer's name.  August 21st, Cape Comedy, Melody Tent, Hyannis, Massachusetts.  You're still promoting?  I'm going to just throw Regan's plugs in there, because he has some major gigs.  He's got a lot of them. 
[01:10:30]  He certainly does.  What's your website, Brian?  What is it?  Just brianregan.com.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Not just.  I was able to get that.  You were.  Hey, I heard you're XM Unmasked, Jim.  Very good.  Oh, thank you.  Very entertaining.  Thank you.  We did that in D.C., I think.  Do you like my mustache?  What?  He's growing a mustache.  Look at his mustache.  Oh, I thought you meant on the XM Unmasked.  I'm like, well, it was radio.  I don't know.  No.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Okay.  Wow.  I mean, it's not like a Latino boxer or anything like that. 
[01:11:00]  No.  No, those are thin and swarthy.  Yeah, exactly.  And then we've been talking about, I still don't know how to say her first name.  L-E-R-Y-N.  L-E-R-Y-N.  L-E-R-Y-N.  L-E-R-Y-N.  L-E-R-Y-N.  L-E-R-Y-N.  L-E-R-Y-N.  She's from Paraguay, and she's a heartthrob, and she came in fourth, and everyone's depressed  that she's out of the Olympics.  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, she's got some great pictures, man.  Yeah.  She's a model, and she's got a calendar, and she also, for some reason, wants to throw 
[01:11:30]  the javelin.  I don't know.  If you look like that, why would you throw the javelin?  Oh, wow.  That's how Dad taught her to keep the guys away.  Just guys impaled through the heart with javelins at school.  Yeah, because look at that picture.  She's looking in a mirror.  She's nude, except for some panties, little panties that she's wearing.  They look like underoos.  I love the side breast shot.  That's always...  Yeah, a little side breast.  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's right. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  And that dumper she has...  Yeah, yeah.  It has, like, the little, what do you call it, with the little soft cheek fadeaway over  the leg?  Like, with the sign of a plump ass is where it doesn't just fade into the leg with the  little...  Oh, right.  There's a little...  A word for that?  I don't know.  We should have, like, a Webster's Dictionary.  There's got to be a word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's an actual crease between the bottom of the buttocks and the leg, where it meets  the leg instead of just sweeping in.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  Which shows a little weightiness to the bus.  You should call, like, some English professor up and go, what is the actual terminology 
[01:12:30]  for that?  Let's see what it is.  What is that area?  Now we got the calendar pictures up.  We're in trouble as a radio show today, man.  Yeah, she's fantastic.  Oh, and dayradio.com will have all these fine visual links for...  Wow.  Those are all Olympic athletes?  Well, it's the same one.  This is the Paraguayan.  Paraguay.  That's the Jabba.  I'm Paraguay.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Let's look at the Latino boxer.  What are we waiting for?  Yes, please.  Google boxer Regan.  I'm sure he'll pop up. 
[01:13:00]  Regan lover.  I've got pictures on my website, so...  Yeah, just go there.  You must have loved the Oscar de la Hoya shots, huh, Brian?  Maybe that's why...  Is that him?  Maybe that's why...  Wah, wah, wee, wah.  Whoa, right.  Wah, wee, wah.  Wait, in the girls' clothes?  What?  In the girls' clothes?  Dressing like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's de la Hoya.  It was that guy, okay.  That's de la Hoya.  Well, he had issues with his dad.  That's why...  Yeah?  That's why I had intended to bring him up.  Well, that makes sense. 
[01:13:30]  Issues with the dad might make you dress in fishnet stockings and...  Wow, look at that.  ...wigs and...  How do they find that so quick?  It's the miracle of the internet.  Hey, I was listening to you guys.  It was hysterical.  The party that you went to?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  I was laughing out loud.  What party?  His pool party?  That was the party.  Yeah, the party, the big wig that Madonna was supposedly at, and you went, and these guys  didn't go.  Oh, my goodness.  That was probably a best of.  That was one of the parties, yeah, from a while back, and I went there, and it was just 
[01:14:00]  an awful...  Yeah, yeah.  Like, nothing was happening.  Madonna was supposed to be there.  You were supposed to have, like, a special way to get in, but that didn't work out.  You had to go get back in line, and...  Yeah, yeah, and I thought I was going to be kind of a privileged guest.  The only person that was there, the biggest celebrity, was, like, Jay from Jay and Silent  Bob, you know.  Right.  And that was pretty much it.  But your callers, man, are hysterical.  They just kept calling, just piling on, man.  Hammering.  Yeah, it's called being thrown under the bus on this show, and it's very hard to crawl 
[01:14:30]  out from that record.  Our listeners are great at that, too.  Our listeners get in the bus, and they know how to put it in reverse and forward over and  over again, just to keep squishing you.  It was big-time funny.  Wait, why couldn't you get in?  We're just don't be radio guys.  This is going back a ways, too.  From time to time.  They just really aired it, like, about a week or two ago.  That's why.  Yeah, that's why we were off.  From time to time, we really think we're somebodies, and then we go to one of these  things and realize, no.  Can't get in.  We're just not.  Like, what?  Hello? 
[01:15:00]  But that's like a walk of shit.  I think that was when we just had gotten to New York.  No, no, that was when I just ditched the wife.  Oh, okay.  That's a while ago.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good thing that's over.  Oh, that's right.  It isn't.  Hey, that party, was Oscar De La Hoya there by the way?  Yeah.  He was asking about you.  Yeah, what was he wearing?  Fishnets and a wig.  He looks silly with the wig.  Like, he doesn't look silly in the fishnets?  Exactly.  Hey, we got the name.  We got the name.  That was the thing that put on. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, what's with the wig?  I'm Mr. Literal Guy now today.  Take the day off, Jim.  I'll be Mr. Literal Bitrooner.  We got the answer to your question about that part of the hiney.  Okay.  Let's go to Brian in PA.  Brian.  Oh, hi.  Anthony, the horizontal lines in the bottom of the butt are called the gluteal folds as  opposed to the vertical line, which is the gluteal cleavage.  Yeah, we're looking for the sexy name.  Yeah, gluteal fold. 
[01:16:00]  Baby, I love your gluteal fold.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  But there is a technical term, apparently.  Yeah.  Gluteal cleavage.  Yuck.  That doesn't sound sexy.  Well, like a plastic surgeon would have to use that kind of language.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, if he was going to be doing work on that area.  You do have some gluteal fold that I think we need to lift here.  Lift as opposed to the gluteal cleavage, Jim, which looks just fine, Oscar.  They're also calling it the gluteal cleft. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, if you Google gluteal cleft, some nice hiney shots come up.  Hey, let's say hi to Jim in Virginia.  Jim.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I've been told it's called a NAIT.  A NAIT?  Wait.  Hold on.  I don't know how sexy that is, but it's called a NAIT.  Is that an acronym for anything?  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Let's go to Lance in New York.  Lance.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Is the acronym wrong? 
[01:17:00]  No, no.  That's right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Brian, have you been out jumping your bicycle lately?  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we have a little boy now that we're kind of doing this all over again.  Yeah.  We used to make the bike ramps out in the road because that's where all the cars are.  You put the cement block out in the middle of the road and you angle some wooden plank  up to it and the object is for one kid to get on his bike, ride as fast as he could 
[01:17:30]  and see how high it could go.  And that's as far as we planned.  It wasn't until the first kid was flipping in midair.  What happens now?  We don't know.  He hit a mailbox.  Bunch of nine-year-old paramedics running up.  We don't know what to do.  Get some leaves.  Nine-year-old paramedics.  Yeah.  We really didn't know much.  No. 
[01:18:00]  And that's when you do get injured the most when you're a little kid like that and just  have no clue what to do.  Mud.  For some reason, mud seemed to be the cure-all with kids if you cut yourself because you'd  watch like an old movie where an Indian would put mud on something.  So you're cutting your knee open and just put some mud on it.  Meanwhile, it's like mud coming.  It's mud from the gutter of the street.  You're so right.  Me and my brothers would throw dirt on our injuries.  Dirt.  Yeah.  Dirt, mud, whatever. 
[01:18:30]  We used to, because we don't want to freak mom out.  We used to, like if you got bloodied up or something like that, we would do the preliminary  work where you'd take one of the brothers into the bathroom and wipe all the blood off  and then you present them to mom.  Present.  Because if the blood is all over their face, she's going to flip out.  So you want to just like get it down to where there's like one little blood source.  One little dripping, one sucking chest wound.  And then you always want to soft pedal it too, you know, where it's like you don't want 
[01:19:00]  to like to freak out.  So you want to like slip it into the conversation.  Hey mom, we know that you said you had to go get some milk later.  So, you know, since you've got to be out anyway, we were just wondering if you just might want  to take him to the hospital.  If you're out, get some peanut butter.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hi. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, another name for that gluteal fold is called the Nagel.  Oh.  I punch it out.  Oh, see.  Oh, see.  The Nagel.  Goofing on our own E-Rock.  Eric Nagel.  Not nice.  Hey, we got a great home invasion story.  Are you, do you carry guns there, Brian?  Yeah, I got three on me.  Nice.  Anthony likes to be armed in his own home.  That's what has happened since you've been here last.  My motto, gun rhymes with fun.  Yeah.  And it's not a coincidence because guns are a lot of fun. 
[01:20:00]  They are fun.  And he was showing off his gun collection at his pool party.  Yeah.  I counted five handguns.  And he's got a closet filled with other things.  Rifles.  All legal.  Shotguns.  All legal.  He plays video games.  And if he gets a nice weapon in a video game, he goes, I want the real version of that.  See, video games have become so realistic as far as the weaponry goes that especially things  like Call of Duty 4, the military style games, that I look and go, you know, I got a lot of 
[01:20:30]  I got to get that gun because it works really well in the game and I like it.  Or that scope is really good.  I got to get an ACOG scope for my AR-15.  So I'll go to the gun store.  I frequent Coliseum guns.  And I'll say, yeah, I want that.  And then I go to the range and it's amazing.  It's like cheating when you have a scope.  What do you fire at?  Do you get to pick things?  Pictures of coworkers. 
[01:21:00]  Things like that.  You bring in like 8 by 10.  Yeah.  Simple things like that.  Put it on the little thing, the clip, and then send it back a few yards and then just  blast some rounds off.  People are like, how come Anthony's pictures all look like photo negatives?  So what's the coolest gun you have?  I mean, I don't know anything about them.  As far as rifles go, you got a little, it's called an FS-2000. 
[01:21:30]  Takes the same round as my AR-15, the .223.  And it's a little bullpup, it's called.  And it looks very futuristic.  Very like Starship Troopers-ish.  So I like that one.  But as far as my handguns go, I got to stick with my HK-40 caliber.  It's very nice.  Although I just picked up a Colt .45.  Now, do they have like little orange tips?  It tastes delicious.  It's a joke.  It's also a malt liquor. 
[01:22:00]  An orange tip like the toy guns?  The only time the tip is orange is when a bullet is flying out of the front of it.  It's called muzzle flash.  You want to get an orange tip for just a fool of burglars?  It's a thinking it's fake.  Don't fake gun.  Get out of my house!  See, where I live seems to be, every other day there's a story of home invasion in where  I live, in the county I live in.  And I'm not going to be the guy.  Because I always say, if you have a home invasion, the story is always the same. 
[01:22:30]  The husband or the man of the house, whatever, is there with a phone cord wrapped around  his neck.  His family's being ravaged.  And do you think, for a second, that in his head, the thought isn't floating around there  that's going, I sure wish I had a gun.  You know he's got to be saying that.  It's not like, perhaps I could talk these gentlemen out of this.  I think I can talk them out.  It's just not going to happen.  And so, I am better safe than sorry, I like to say. 
[01:23:00]  I made that up.  So, guns, guns, guns.  Yeah, but we lost you when we learned that you actually carry it in your house.  Well, it's not good enough to have the guns in nice strategic locations.  He now has to walk around with one on his hip.  You know, like a holster?  Like a Western?  Well, not a Western tie-down-on-my-leg holster thing.  It's a concealed holster, so you don't see it.  But a lot of times, see, I go to the range a lot. 
[01:23:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  You're hiding it from yourself?  Yeah, I don't want to know I have it.  Because Lord knows what I do.  It'll scare me if I start thinking I actually carry a gun around like that.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's frightening.  You're the only one in the house.  Why do you have a concealed weapon?  Exactly.  I have no idea.  Now, I go to the range a lot.  So, after I go to the range, I don't take the gun off.  I kind of keep it there, and then I clean it.  Make sure they're clean.  Nice, clean action.  Smooth.  Smooth, Charlene.  Smooth, Charlene. 
[01:24:00]  Nice.  I mention this because there's a great home invasion story happening.  Oh, yes, see?  Or that did happen.  And I think this woman followed Anthony's advice and made sure she had a gun.  Uh-oh.  Yep.  See?  This has a great ending, this home invasion.  Listen to this.  In Pennsylvania, an 85-year-old woman caught a burglar red-handed.  Lita Smith says that she came home, her side door was kicked in, and instead of running,  she went inside and got her loaded pistol.  She pulled her gun on the 17-year-old burglar and made him call 911. 
[01:24:30]  She kept that gun on him until police arrived, and he was charged with attempted burglary.  There you go.  You've got to love it.  She made him call the police on himself.  There you go.  Ultimate humiliation.  That really is.  Hi.  Pick up the phone.  And she's 85 on top of it.  911.  Yeah.  911 operator.  It's the emergency.  Yeah.  I want to report. 
[01:25:00]  Do I have to do this?  I want to report burglary.  Okay.  Are you okay?  Is everything okay in the house?  No, I'm really not.  I got a gun.  Yes, I'm extremely embarrassed and humiliated.  Is the perpetrator still in the house?  Oh, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He is still in the house.  How embarrassing.  Can you describe him? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Let me get to a mirror.  He's about my height.  Right.  Yeah.  He got my hair color, my eyes.  I'm 6'2".  I would actually go.  Hello, 911?  Yeah.  I was at home and an 89-year-old lady came and she's robbing me right now.  She's holding a gun to me.  Please send the police.  Yes.  Send the police.  Shoot first because she said she's not going to be taken alive and she wants to take down  as many cops as she can. 
[01:26:00]  She's old and crazy and has a gun.  That's a great one.  Home invention.  All right.  We got Brian Regan, Comedy Central, Saturday, September 6th.  Yes, yes, yes.  At 10 p.m.?  Yep.  And then the DVD will be out on September 9th.  And then Letterman on the 29th.  How many times have you done Letterman?  You've done Letterman four times, right?  How many Lettermans have you done?  This will be 20.  20?  Lettermans.  Are you kidding? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  No, I mean...  Don't you know when you do that?  You're kidding, right?  Yeah.  No, I mean, no.  No, no, I'm not.  Yes.  Yes, it is 20.  Yes.  No, I'm not kidding.  Yes to the answer and no to the question.  I hear when you do Letterman 20 times, he actually sits down and talks to you after the show.  So that's good.  You'll finally get to...  Oh, no.  Do you panel all?  Do you stand up?  Do you stand up, panel?  It's usually always just stand up, man.  I just do my thing and then go home.  August 29th, that is.  That's awesome.  And then BrianRegan.com for everything else. 
[01:27:00]  He has so many plugs here.  Check into the energy drink that Brian Regan is promoting.  Opie and Anthony will continue.  And then he'll be at the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire on  August 23rd.  And then on the 24th, the South Shore Music Circus in Cohasset, Massachusetts.  Brian Regan has so many plugs, I figured I would just do it during the commercial break.  And then he'll be at the Avery Fisher Hall as part of the New York Comedy Festival on November 9th. 
[01:27:30]  And then his energy drink comes out in December.  Holy, yes.  Energy drink.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Brian Regan has been doing our show for, I would say, 10 years at this point.  Mm-hmm.  Going back to Boston.  He was on with you in Boston once or twice before you guys came down this road.  Wow.  And we like the Brian Regan that likes to drink after the comedy show.  Anthony's gotten to see that a few times.  That was that one time.  Yeah.  That was one time at a beer or something, right?  Yeah, I think we split it. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, we split that beer.  One beer, two straws, I said.  That was crazy, man.  I remember a story at Caroline's.  Brian doesn't do a lot of that drinking, but things were getting so crazy in the N.E.W. days  with Brian Regan.  And I'm not even going to say why they were, but they were, because I don't want it to  happen again to you.  And he was selling out so many shows at Caroline's that they forced him to do three shows a night,  which is just insane for a comic.  And I would go, and Jimmy would go to the shows and stuff, and we'd get to hang out with 
[01:28:30]  Brian in between shows, and he was doing shots just to deal with the craziness that  was happening at Caroline's.  Because they would throw a 2 a.m. show at Brian.  Brian, we've got to do a 2 a.m. show.  And Brian's like, but everyone's really wasted now.  There's a line outside.  Right.  We're just going to get out there.  Well, the shots had nothing to do with the shows.  That's just how I live my life, man.  Yeah.  I'll do a shot before I go to church.  You know?  We, we, yeah, we, there was a night we closed Caroline's and then walked around the corner 
[01:29:00]  to another bar just for the hell of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Just, just because, you know what?  It wasn't time to stop drinking when the bar closes.  Amazing.  What I like about.  Usually that's like a hint.  Yeah, yeah.  When they're closing up, it's, we're closing.  Yeah.  It seems, well, it's time to go home.  No.  But it didn't seem to click in our heads.  Look at that.  There's another bar right there that's open.  Isn't that neon?  And you know all the people in there have left bars that were closing too, so you really 
[01:29:30]  get the, the best clientele in those places.  You know you have a, you know you have a drinking problem when you close a bar, then you find  an after hours bar.  Yeah.  That closes down and then you're knocking on some like brownstone somewhere that has  a secret, secret after, after hours bar going on.  I'll give you worse.  You go back to your hotel and raid the mini bar.  And then the mini bar finally.  Because there's no more bars open, but there's a mini bar.  I remember being in Montreal, the Montreal Comedy Festival years ago, and it was one of 
[01:30:00]  my first experiences with a mini bar.  And somebody was having like a party up in their room, you know, because all the bars  were closed and I didn't want to go empty handed.  So I opened up that mini bar and I, you know, I saw those little liquor bottles.  Oh no.  So I got a pillowcase.  Oh no.  What do you think?  They just put them in there for your convenience?  I just emptied out the whole thing and brought my pillowcase of goodies up to the party,  you know?  And I didn't know until checkout, you know, it was like $1,700 for liquor. 
[01:30:30]  I'm like, what?  It's like, wow, Mr. Regan.  Here's a card.  This is a program that perhaps you should look into.  We'll keep this between you and I.  Wow.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're Mike.  You're missing the point, too, on what white trash Regan is to think that's a classy move.  A booze in the pillowcase.  To bring alcohol in a pillowcase to another hotel room.  Oh, we're not.  It's good once you get there and if you get in a fight on your way to the room, you 
[01:31:00]  could swing that pillowcase into someone's face.  You know what?  Brian might be fooling his audiences, but he doesn't fool us.  We know this is a facade you got here.  No, that's a true story, man.  Yeah, that's what we're saying.  Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  Right.  Yeah.  What I like about Brian, I got to say, every time I see him, a lot of new material.  Well, thanks, man.  And as a fan, I so appreciate that.  That's very cool.  You're always working on your craft.  Always kind enough to come out and check it out. 
[01:31:30]  And I don't want to be embarrassed and be doing the same stuff.  So, like, I'll just wing stuff on stage.  I look out and see you guys.  I better make something new up.  So it looks like I'm working on my show.  Have you noticed I haven't checked you out as much as I used to?  Because I really, I started feeling like I was a stalker.  All of a sudden, I would, Brian would be in Philly.  And I would happen to be in Philly, but Brian doesn't believe that.  And all of a sudden, he would see me backstage like, oh, hi.  And then he would be up in Boston and I'm backstage at one of his Boston shows.  Well, those all made sense.  But then it would be like Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 
[01:32:00]  What?  In Vegas at the airport when you fly home.  Yeah, right.  He's kind of waiting there.  Is there a baggage claim?  I don't believe the coincidence.  Wow.  Knocking on his door in Vegas.  Are you working on anything new?  He said you want to try that on me.  I'm always appreciative, man.  You can come out anytime you want, man.  I like to see comedians, but that's a testament to you.  I probably see you more than any other comedians.  Well, I'm very, very flattered by that, man.  And I love your local TV stuff you do. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, thank you.  About...  The local newscasters?  Brilliant stuff.  Do you?  Brilliant.  I appreciate that.  Brilliant stuff where they're all trying to up each other and say they're the only one  that has the big stories and this and that.  And they use all those cute slogans.  Yeah.  I like the transitions they do from one story to the next.  I don't know why they don't think you can't handle a brand new story.  I don't get that.  I wish they would go, well, that's the end of that story.  Now, here's another one that has nothing to do with it.  Yeah.  Can you handle that, home viewer? 
[01:33:00]  They got to bridge it every time.  Hey, that's a big lotto jackpot.  Speaking of lotto, there was a lotto crime in the city today.  You know what I hate about the lottery is I hate enduring people's lottery number ticket stories.  They're the absolute lamest stories.  And people tell them as if they're like, you know, riveting.  Hey, you're not going to believe what happened, man.  I, you know how I play the lotto. 
[01:33:30]  I bought five tickets, right?  In the first ticket, I had the two, four, nine, 27, 30.  In the second ticket, I had a two, four, but I got the, I got the 10 on the second ticket instead of the nine.  And I had the 26 and a 28.  The third ticket, I like to wheel the four sometimes.  So I wheeled the four.  I had a two and I wheeled the four with a five and a nine and a 28.  In the fifth ticket, I dropped the two off and I had the three. 
[01:34:00]  I wheeled, I did a baby wheel on the four.  The seven, I, I, I, I, with the seven, I put an eight right next to it.  And then 16 and the 24.  Well, the numbers came in two, four, six, 27 and 28.  Now, if I would have had the two and a four from the first ticket and the six,  if I would have had the six and the eight from the third ticket and a four from the second ticket and the nine, 
[01:34:30]  if I would have baby wheeled the nine, sometimes I baby wheeled, you know, baby wheeled a nine.  If I'm coming like on my birthday or something.  If I would have, if I would have baby wheeled the nine, I wouldn't be here.  Man, man, I wish you'd have hit it.  I wish you'd have hit that.  Sounds like it's so close.  Yeah, you will.  Man, you like, you kind of had all the numbers spread out in the different tickets. 
[01:35:00]  But they were all on the same ticket.  Oh, what a drag.  They weren't on the same ticket.  I used to see that at the, um, at the OTB used to work next to a place.  And at lunch, we'd all go to the OTB and place a few bets on some ponies down there at Belmont.  And, uh, there were the old guys that would stand there and they have the racing form in their hand.  And they constantly, after every race, they'd slam in their hand and go,  And they would talk about, they had, you know, I had the, I had the, you know, it came in like, uh, two, two, four, six horse came in. 
[01:35:30]  That's what, that was the order.  They'd be like, I had the two with the six for the triple.  And then I had, I had the four horse in another ticket.  It's the same exact thing.  It's like, no, you lost.  Rip your ticket up.  Go get another hobby.  Just as useless as having, uh, a horse that was not even in the money. 
[01:36:00]  Ah, that's what they do.  They slap their hand.  Ah, son of a bitch.  I can't believe it didn't come in the way I wanted it to.  How come they don't come in the way I wanted it to?  And they hate winners.  Oh, do they hate when someone goes, yeah.  They just look, ah.  Ah, grouchy old bastards spending every dime they have on the horses.  Yeah.  Good, good stories. 
[01:36:30]  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  What do you come up with your ideas?  Anything worse than that question?  Oh, you know, I think one of the worst is when you're doing like a, a phoner, right?  A phone radio interview, and they go, can you give us an example of your humor?  I mean, could there be a lamer?  An example of your humor.  There's absolutely no way to ever live up to that.  Yes, I have a prime example of my humor. 
[01:37:00]  Imagine if you will.  I'm on stage, right?  And then I say something like, knock, knock.  I just, I, I, I almost want to hang up.  I want to like pretend, pretend like I have a bad connection when they, when they ask.  You could.  I should.  What?  I'm not doing that.  Can you give us an example of it?  Well, we'll try to get Brian back on the film to ask him that in-depth question about his humor. 
[01:37:30]  But right now, we've got a twofer from Led Zeppelin.  They're just lazy radio interviews.  Where do you get, where do you get those funny ideas?  When I'm dismembering hookers, I, these things just come to me.  They pop into my head.  It's really weird.  I'm out committing horrific crimes.  And all of a sudden, I'll think, hey, directions on Pop-Tarts.  Where do you get your ideas?  Usually while watching rape porn, believe it or not. 
[01:38:00]  It's so bizarre.  Yeah, a lot of people wouldn't know that.  But that's really where it comes from.  That's the seed.  That's the nucleus.  That's my inspiration.  Of where the bits come from.  Because when they ask you, you realize you have no idea.  It's like, I don't know.  There's no real, it just kind of happens.  It's like, there's no specific source, but you can't tell people that.  Or they'll ask something that's way above what you ever do.  You know, what is your process?  My what?  Process?  Wake up in the morning.  I take a dump.  Every six months, I get lucky enough to think of something. 
[01:38:30]  If I'm not too lazy, I'll jot it on a napkin.  There's the point.  That's funny.  That's my process.  Your process.  Yeah, they try to break it apart scientifically.  It's not really art.  Is there a formula to your comedy writing?  Or if they say something that sounds smarter than what you do, you just agree with it?  When you're watching the news, do you ever break it down and say, this is kind of, and  you're like, yeah, that's what I do.  It's never what I do.  No.  That's what I do.  Ever.  No, I swing and miss a lot, whatever it connects with. 
[01:39:00]  I do that again.  Yeah.  There it is.  Hey, we got two really good stories.  You got a choice here.  We could do, woman had feces thrown at her while pregnant.  Okay, I'm so hot.  Or baby whale thinks yacht is its mother.  Wow.  Now, I say go with the feces because the whale one I could kind of understand, big  dumb whale, big boat.  I get it.  Stupid lamp oil machine.  A lamp oil machine. 
[01:39:30]  All a whale is.  You're equating, you're understanding the whale.  I can kind of get that.  Yeah.  I can see how I misinterpret a boat as another whale.  Yeah.  Let's go with the feces.  By the way, I like your whale bit.  Thank you.  I'm not saying you should do it right now.  I'm just saying that it's a classic Brian Regan bit.  Appreciate that.  This is what the whales are saying, right?  Yeah.  Here's the feces story.  Anna Goiz can breathe a little easier now that our two-month-old baby is...  Oh, now that they cleaned her face.  Ah. 
[01:40:00]  Ow.  Wowee.  Anna Goiz can breathe a little easier now that our two-month-old baby is physically healthy.  But most of her pregnancy was fraught with fear and complications.  Instead of enjoying welcoming my baby, I was just so afraid of what would have happened,  what could go wrong.  Last December, Goiz was splattered with a bag full of human feces when a group of teens  threw the bag into Walgreens in O'Fallon, Missouri.  Goiz was 10 weeks pregnant at the time.  Oh, that's terrible. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  Ay, no.  That's just terrible.  That's the whole story?  We got a little more.  Oh, God.  Splattered feces.  Kids will be kids.  You know.  I did that all the time with my buddies.  We just, you know, drive by Walgreens and throw a bag of feces in.  Feces.  It's just a kid thing, you know?  You know, you're kidding, but...  Ah, yes.  Oh, boy.  We never threw a bag of that.  I'm going the absurd route, and Jim Norton's like, whoa, hold on. 
[01:41:00]  Well, there's a...  A couple stories.  Truth is stranger than fiction.  We would put the...  We would get a dog crap and put it in the library book slot.  Was a favorite.  Oh, God.  That was a favorite of ours.  Me and my buddy Tom Naylor would do that in North Brunswick.  Just because we knew the library would have to fish out the books and just see that.  Try to clean up.  Yeah.  She's just a dumb volunteer.  Yeah.  What are you doing to her?  She's got to deal with all that. 
[01:41:30]  All that.  Right.  So, they threw the bag into the Walgreens.  How did it affect her?  I don't get that.  Yeah, we're going to find out.  I'm hoping here.  On Monday, 18-year-old Kyle Medley of O'Fallon, Missouri, pled guilty to misdemeanor assault  and property damage.  Another teen is awaiting trial on the same charges.  Kyle Medley could have gotten up to a year and a half in county jail.  Instead, the judge gave him a two-year probation.  And during those two years, he must not have contact with the victim or his co-defendant.  Goiz, who works as a teacher, is angry and disappointed. 
[01:42:00]  At the time, she felt so humiliated, she needed professional counseling.  For Christmas, I didn't want to go out.  I spent the entire Christmas, well, the entire break, pretty much, in my room with the blinds  closed.  I want the community to get the message, we cannot tolerate this.  I don't want other teens to think, well, they got away with this.  So, why don't we start doing this and, well, something else.  Who's doing that?  Something else.  It never happens.  It doesn't happen.  It's not this big epidemic.  It's just feces splattering in people's faces. 
[01:42:30]  We have to carry umbrellas when it's sunny because bags of doo-doo are flying by.  Stupid, get a hold of your blind clothes.  We have to let the community know, what?  Bags of doo-doo.  Does anybody think it's acceptable?  Do you have to inform the community?  Are there people who are going, I guess you're right, good point.  I would have co-signed for that until you showed me.  I guess we should stop throwing bags of feces.  I like the way that guy's not allowed to have contact with the victim. 
[01:43:00]  Like he would want to reach out and go, hey, what do you think about what I did?  His anonymous victim that just got in the way of his flying bag of doo-doo.  Yeah, remember that?  Remember when I threw that bag of doo-doo?  What do you think about that?  It was me.  Was he throwing it at her?  They don't say it.  It was just kind of random.  I think it was random.  I think it was just, they didn't sit into the wall.  You think he's a marksman with that?  Yes, he was aiming right for her face.  This guy's brilliant.  That would be a horrific crime.  You're born again hard. 
[01:43:30]  There's nothing more deadly than a Marine and a bag of feces.  Let's go to Mike in Alabama.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Great show.  Thank you.  Hey, we used to go on kind of toward the direction Jimmy was going.  We used to take dog caca and smear it up underneath people's door handles on their car.  Wow.  Oh, is that an awful thing to do?  Wow.  I'm just stunned by the word caca. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  It just doesn't, because it doesn't come off of your hand very easily.  You can scrub and scrub and scrub.  Oh, it's fine.  Oh, well, you just talk.  It's your show.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, sir.  I'll wait for you.  You tell me when you're done.  And, you know, the guy's talking.  He's talking into his phone like it's just a CB radio microphone.  The part that he hears with is in his hand. 
[01:44:30]  And he's just going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I can't hear anyone else talking.  Jesus.  All right, let's go to Paul then.  Paul, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got?  Huh?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  As usual, the...  Yes, sir.  Yes, Paul.  I'll wait for you guys.  Sorry.  I love it.  He doesn't want to endure a reprimand.  Am I free to speak?  As usual, the news anchor got it all wrong here. 
[01:45:00]  The real story here is that this woman is a teacher and she can't even speak English.  Okay.  We wanted to go with you.  Yeah, we really...  I was with you for the story, but then it went nowhere.  Yeah.  Yeah, she had a tough time speaking the English.  I heard that too, Paul.  But that...  All right.  That damn under the door handle is fantastic.  That is so bad.  You probably think at first, how did this... 
[01:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  Someone put it here.  Yeah, how did a dog get his...  But then...  Major Nelson, a dog?  But then how...  But I saw the...  And then there was...  He's always so confused, Dr. Bellows.  But wouldn't you, like, be embarrassed that you actually have that moment where you wonder  how the dog did it?  Yeah.  What?  Before the smart part of your brain kicks and...  Ah, wait a second.  Young pranksters.  That's like a gag by a prankster.  It was trickery.  What?  How many people have napkinned off their hand and then angrily immediately driven to 
[01:46:00]  a car wash with their windows rolled up and the car stunk inside?  You can't have your car.  I had to explain to the guys, could you get under the door handle, please?  Yeah, could you do under the door handle, please?  Why?  Why?  Just do it.  Just clean under the door handle.  Leave me alone.  Chris.  It never probably goes away under there because the rain doesn't hit under the handle.  Of course not, Jimmy.  That's why it's so evil.  That's why it's brilliant.  That's fantastic.  Chris in Texas has a good one.  Chris.  Where do you get your ideas?  Well, I was thinking, how could I smear dog do where the person won't even know they're 
[01:46:30]  touching it?  What's your process?  Well, I've got the dog poop.  And I find a car with the door.  You can't use the old style ones with the push button.  You need the lift handles.  Push button's good, too, though.  If you want to go push button, because I don't just push the button and it pops open.  You get to push the button and then your four fingers loop in.  Oh, wow.  I didn't even think of that.  So, as you pull back, you're getting four right in the crease of your fingers.  Right in the nape.  Or the nape.  Yes, right in the nape of your fingers. 
[01:47:00]  We've got to go on from Chris in Texas.  Chris.  All right.  I've got to make this really quick.  We used to do what was called the poop purse.  Now, what you do is you take an old purse that nobody's using anymore, and you fill  it up with various feasai.  Feasai.  Various.  I like the fact that it's various.  Various.  Feasai.  I've got to make sure I have a nice selection.  Yeah, you don't want to just have one source.  Yeah, you need various.  Nice mixture.  Sometimes I put in a little horse just to bind it all together. 
[01:47:30]  Most people wouldn't do that.  They wouldn't think.  And used feminine products, if you will, and set it underneath a streetlight at night  and wait for cars to pass by.  People would stop and be, hmm, purse, money.  Grab the purse, drive about 50, 60 yards or whatever, and all you would see is the purse  fly out of the window.  We have to do poop purse today on the other side. 
[01:48:00]  Can we do poop purse, Danny?  Poop purse.  You got anything going on today?  Probably not.  That's a great video.  Probably can't.  A bunch of videos, though.  How funny would those videos be on YouTube?  That kind of.  That sort of happened to me when I was a kid in a roundabout way.  I was just hanging out with one of my friends and a group of older kids that we knew from  the neighborhood, but they were older than us by like five years.  They jumped out of a car hysterically laughing.  One of the kids, he just hands me a bag.  He goes, dude, hold this for two seconds.  I'll be right back.  They get back in the car, speed away. 
[01:48:30]  So now I'm just sitting there holding a bag, of which I don't know what it is because  they had it in like two bags so you couldn't see through.  So obviously the curiosity got the better of me, so I started squeezing the bottom of  the bag.  And when it was nice and soft, I kind of realized what the gag was.  That is funny.  Although they did end up coming back to see if I was still on the corner holding a bag  of poop.  But if they pull back up, you want it back now?  Well, he ended up ripping the top of it off, so he had the stuff in question kind of on 
[01:49:00]  his hand, separated by the plastic, so it was kind of like he was holding a pizza tray  and then just kind of splat it up on the wall of one of the businesses.  Oh, wow.  That's nice and antisocial.  Yeah.  But that would be almost hot if it was like a Russian stripper who handed you the bag.  I think it's almost sexy.  Pretty blonde jumps out with a great body.  Behold this, sure.  Pleased to behold this for me.  That's a Russian stripper.  Have we ever played that phone call?  I just want to, we got to keep it very vague, of that girl. 
[01:49:30]  That's pretty vague.  Who?  Well, I'm doing some stuff.  Oh, right.  She was in the truck.  Truck.  Oh.  Have we ever played it over here?  I don't think so.  I think we have, as long as we don't explain what's going on.  Really?  You can't explain what's going on?  I don't know.  Yeah, probably not.  Well, don't explain it now.  No, I wouldn't do that.  My God.  This is the only chance we have, is to go vague on it.  It's one of the best phone calls we've ever gotten, Brian.  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah.  Well, in its category. 
[01:50:00]  In that particular category, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing how many stories there are about this.  Oh, I know.  They just, like, all of a sudden, I'm looking at the phone lines.  They're packed with people that have stories of what they've done with dog refuse.  Well, now we're talking to our audience.  We were talking politics earlier.  Crickets.  Nothing.  Yeah.  No phones ringing.  Now, look at the phones.  Like, what if you're talking about our audience?  You know, ways to give charitably.  Yeah.  Crickets. 
[01:50:30]  The phones.  Nothing.  Then we start talking to the engineer going, are the phones working?  Are you sure?  Give us your best charity story.  Yeah, we're like, are the phones working?  Because this election is very important, and they should be calling on this one.  Nothing worse than when you think the phones are broke, so you pick your own phone up and  dial the number and see it ring.  You're like, yeah, we're really hitting them today with a subject they can relate to.  Yeah, who do you think Obama's picking as vice president?  Give us a call.  We'll take your duty stories.  Three weeks from now, people will be, are you still talking about bags of poop? 
[01:51:00]  Let's say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, I see what you want to say.  Okay, so you've got to kind of, you know, try to be vague.  We've got a smart audience.  They can figure stuff out.  I bet he does this completely wrong.  You're going for a dump on it?  I'm going for, let me bet.  I bet he does this so it's got to be dumped.  I bet this gets dumped.  I have faith in him.  All right.  Five bucks that it gets dumped.  I don't have that much faith in him.  All right.  Jeff, please tell your story. 
[01:51:30]  I'll bet one dollar.  All right.  One dollar bet.  Thank you for the confidence.  What we used to do is, you know, nice and late at night, we would go out and drink a lot of Snapples.  And then when we were done with the Snapples and the bottles were empty, we would go number one and number two in them.  And then go to people's homes and launch them through a window onto the second floor.  That way, when it went through the window, not only did it break the window and there'd be glass everywhere,  they'd have to clean up number one and number two all over their house. 
[01:52:00]  Whether it got dumped or not, that's worth the dollar.  That's an awful thing to do.  That's like horrible.  That's sociopathic.  Terroristic.  Just angry.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Wow.  You know, it's another good thing to do.  If you go to the supermarket and you get bologna, like in those little packets,  if you go over to people with really nice, expensive cars in the middle of the night, like say midnight,  and you stick them to the car in about five or six different places by morning,  it falls off and the starch or whatever it is that's in the bologna takes off the paint with it. 
[01:52:30]  So you've got a nice polka dot Mercedes.  That's great.  What do you do to small animals and children who are lost?  I like the way you said it was another good thing to do.  Yeah.  I like the first one.  I think bad.  I think bad is the right terminology.  You know what else is great?  You take a Snapple bottle full of gasoline in a rag.  You light it and throw it through someone's window.  Usually someone of an ethnic background that isn't part of our neighborhood.  What?  Yeah.  You take a wheelchair, you look for a doc. 
[01:53:00]  All right, Jeff, thank you.  No problem.  Very good.  We're going to take one more.  And you know what?  After the break, I think we continue with this subject because the phones are lit.  Got John in New York.  John.  Of course they are.  Hey, guys.  One of the fine things we used to do with dog feces was we would go to a local gym and  smear a dog poop all over the feet that were chained to the bicep that were chained  to the bike rack.  Why?  I don't understand this.  Danny has a comment.  I just remembered something else that had happened as a child. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  Me and my friends were hanging out on a golf course with some beers.  So, of course, the only logical thing to do on a golf course was to have someone do  their business and into one of the holes.  Into the cups.  So the next morning when somebody would, you know, plow in, they'd go to reach it.  Oh, God.  Hey, I got a hole in one.  Yeah.  Oh, it takes away from the joy of that moment really quickly.  Did you see that shot?  I just, oh, son of a, best shot of my life. 
[01:54:00]  You want to keep the ball and put it up on your mantle?  You got to throw it away.  Throw it in the woods.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Brian Regan, brianregan.com.  That's the easiest way.  You got a Letterman thing happening.  But the Comedy Central, we should get out there.  August 29th is Letterman.  And then September 6th, Saturday at 10 o'clock is the Comedy Central.  And then the DVD comes out September 9th.  Brian Regan, everybody.  Thank you, guys.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:54:30]  I was going to ignore it, but we should bring it up on the show.  Brian Regan just left here in a fit of rage.  Something pissed him off.  He said, I'm out of here.  He threw his coffee.  And that's that.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  Someone say something?  I don't know.  You might want to ask Brian. 
[01:55:00]  Say, hey, what's your problem, man?  I was in the bathroom when I came out.  I was actually surprised he left.  Yeah.  And he was with his wife and his agent.  Yeah.  And I just see the back of them.  The back of their heads.  They're walking down the hall at K-Rock.  And they just opened the door quickly.  I did hear him scream, I'll give you poo.  I'll give you poo.  Why?  Wait, is Steve around?  Probably. 
[01:55:30]  Jimmy, why do you do this?  Because I did.  What did I do to you?  Just tell me.  Just tell me what did I do to you.  And I'll apologize and we'll move on.  I hate him on the air.  I bet Steve is around somewhere.  By the way, we can't do that to Brian, obviously.  Yeah, of course.  He had other things to do.  BrianRegan.com for everything he's up to.  Here comes Radio Kryptonite.  Steve, quickly.  Why did Brian leave?  What happened?  He had to tape a TV show. 
[01:56:00]  What a fool.  Thanks, Jim.  Hey, we got more poo stories  on the phones.  We also, we're going to try to mop up here  because we got lots to do.  We mop up.  Well, we got the table tennis women.  Isn't that ping pong?  No way.  Wow.  What happened?  I'm just looking at the clock. 
[01:56:30]  I know.  That flew.  I know.  Jiminy Cricket.  Ping pong.  Two Jews walking to a bar.  Well, technically one was Pentecostal.  What?  What are you doing?  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  I don't know.  I haven't opened the door yet. 
[01:57:00]  Knock, knock.  Could you ring the bell?  It's a little easier for me to hear.  Wipe your feet before you come in.  A black guy, a Jewish guy, and an Italian  are going down in a plane.  Were they sitting in first class or coach?  I'm improvising.  Steve from Petro. 
[01:57:30]  Why'd the chicken cross the road?  I'm not sure.  Perhaps he had something to do.  That's great.  We love you, Steve.  You know that.  Gary Glitter.  Oh.  Speaking of Steve.  Yes.  Well, we got ping pong, too.  I think Gary Glitter is hotter.  And we got you two, well, Bono doing something really stupid.  But what do you want to do?  Gary Glitter?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  That's a sexy story.  This Gary Glitter should just not be able to live at this point.  When they catch guys like that, they know you did it.  They should just put a gun in your mouth and blow the back of your head out.  Yeah, because this guy, there's no fixing his problem.  He's a predator.  And that's it.  He'll always be one.  And this proves it.  He's famous for saying, hey, every 30 seconds in a song.  Yeah.  That is played at every sports arena.  And he spent a lot of time in jail for having sex with underage girls, right? 
[01:58:30]  In Vietnam.  He finally got out.  And somehow he ended up in the airport in Thailand.  Wow.  Thailand.  And he refuses to go back to London.  Thailand.  What happens in Thailand?  You think.  You have to take a connecting flight from Vietnam to Thailand.  That's just, wow.  Thailand.  Oh, that's right.  You have sex with children in Thailand.  What is it?  Pedo Airline?  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  God.  All the meals are kids meals.  Yeah.  The movies, the bad news bears all the time.  That's all they play.  He just wants to go from, he just can't get enough of that.  That's what he wants to do when he's out of jail, go to Thailand.  Because he knows, he probably knows places in Thailand where you can go and have sex with  kids where he knows he won't get caught, like really dark, under, seedy places.  And he probably knows where they are.  And he's just, the guy should just die. 
[01:59:30]  How is he affording all this off one dumb song?  Yeah.  So he ended up in Thailand.  He faked illness so they don't fly him back to London.  And if he goes back to London, what, they're going to try to charge him with some stuff,  I'm thinking?  Either that or they may take his passport away so he can no longer travel.  To these countries.  How can they do that in London, though, if you didn't do anything in London?  Well, if you're convicted of a crime, I don't know the exact ruling on their system, but  you know, if you lose your rights, you lose your rights here if you're convicted of a 
[02:00:00]  felony in certain areas and you're not allowed to move about as easily.  What is that thing they have over there where you can be, I'm not sure if this is the exact  term, but it's something like held at the discrimination of the queen?  The queen, yeah.  Or at the something of the queen where, like here, they can't just hold you.  Yeah, they can't just put you in jail here and kind of hold you with no charges filed  or anything.  But there, they could put you in jail and just kind of hold you there as long as they  want, as long as the queen says, keep him in there. 
[02:00:30]  Like Guantanamo, kind of.  Yeah, yeah.  You can just put him there and suspect him.  They have that kind of thing.  Wow.  They could just kind of throw you in jail.  Well, the thing with him is he's being forced out of Vietnam, as he should be.  Um, why are they flying him back to London?  Why doesn't he fly somewhere else?  I'm guessing no place will take him.  But why a London flight?  He's like that floating garbage scowl that was going around New York City years ago.  No one wants him.  Yeah.  He's Hyman Roth.  Hyman Roth. 
[02:01:00]  I'm a pedophile in search of children.  I'm here in Thailand.  If I wake up and I see gummy bears, I'll know I have a pot.  What a filth bag.  Just trying to go somewhere else to molest kids.  Me and your father would molest children in Thailand.  Your father supplied the gum, the bubble gum for the children.  The story's kind of confusing because it says, Glitter in limbo as Thailand refuses him entry. 
[02:01:30]  So Thailand declared British former glam rocker Gary Glitter's persona non grata.  Wednesday and threatened to deport him back to Vietnam.  But that would be a good thing for him, wouldn't it?  I don't know.  There's obviously a problem with him being in Vietnam.  So they're going to watch him pretty closely in Vietnam.  They might not let him back into Vietnam.  Maybe Vietnam is saying you have to leave the country or you're going back to jail.  I mean, there's obviously a reason where he would hang out in Nam and not feel forced to go to Britain.  He looks like a creep, man.  These pictures of him.  A 64-year-old was due to have boarded an overnight flight to London from Bangkok but was still wandering the airport transit lounge more than 16 hours after flying in from Vietnam. 
[02:02:00]  He initially complained of chest pains, refusing to board the Thai Airways plane to the British capital.  But it was unclear what would happen next.  A doctor examined him in the transit lounge and said Glitter was suffering from a minor inflammation in his chest, declaring him fit to travel.  Thailand's immigration chief said Glitter refused to board the next flight to London but had been declared persona non grata.  It would not be allowed to enter Thailand. 
[02:02:30]  So he has to just stay at the airport.  How about just get on the plane or we're going to break your legs?  Right.  How about we stop being nice to people who have just gotten out of jail for having sex with children?  Thailand should really.  Why don't we send him to Singapore and have a mule of a little heroin?  That would be nice.  The terms of Glitter's sentence called for his deportation upon his release from jail and it appeared unlikely Vietnam would allow him to return.  He could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here, said Thailand's commander, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:03:00]  Thailand kicks you out.  We were talking about how bad you have to be that Thailand goes, we don't want you here.  There are businessmen doing a conga line over there to have sex with young boys and they don't seem to do anything about it.  Did you read the quote from the Thai lieutenant general?  He poses a danger to a peaceful and orderly society and offends Thai morals.  Wow, he is bad.  Wow, wow, wow.  Speaking of that, look at Miss Teen USA.  Is that who she is?  Stevie Perry.  Steve Perry is her name? 
[02:03:30]  What the hell is that?  There's a little eye at the end.  Okay.  A tiny little eye.  She doesn't look like a teen.  She's pretty, man.  Wow, wow, we wah.  Yes.  Yes.  Wow, we wah.  Let's say hi to Corey in New Hampshire.  Corey.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I'm going to follow that Gary Glitter story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But we used to rub acid into people's screen doors and watch them wash it out because it  would be either sprayed it up against their door or sprayed it out into the yard and they  were never able to clean it up for forever. 
[02:04:00]  Acid?  No, no, no.  No, not acid.  We're back to the, yeah, we're back to those stories.  Oh.  In the screen door.  Yeah, we'd pick it up in a bag and we'd just rub it all over the screen door.  That's pretty funny.  All right, yeah, that's a rough one to get out.  Like a cheese grater.  Yeah.  Daniel, Alabama.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  All right, I got a good story for you.  When I was in junior high and in band, we had a little kid in band that I really just 
[02:04:30]  disliked.  So one day, I snuck into the band room where all the instruments were, got his trumpet  and turned the bell end up and managed to pinch out just one perfect little snickerdoodle  of a loaf right into his trumpet and then just kind of tamped it down in there real good.  And so the next day during band practice, you know, we all sat in like a semicircle.  It's about 70 students.  And the band director's going around instrument to instrument and warming them up and everybody's 
[02:05:00]  playing their little notes so he can, you know, get everybody in tune.  And he gets to the trumpets and the kid starts complaining that he can't blow through it.  So something, something, and then the band director said, well, just open your spit valve.  It's probably just a bunch of spit and just blow into it real hard.  Rhymed with spit valve.  By this time, everybody's sitting there just kind of staring at him.  And so he pulls back real hard and blows into it as hard as he can and outfalls the little  trumpet.  He falls back over the chair trying to get away from it. 
[02:05:30]  Oh my God.  Nice.  So did they already reuse that trumpet or they just threw it out?  I want to say that they had to reuse it because it was fairly expensive.  Well, since it happened, it just sounds like crap.  Jimmy's face.  Not even, not even the hint of a smile.  He's disgusted with what I said.  Hold on.  I'm actually, uh, I'm touching my nose scab and then smelling it and it smells a little 
[02:06:00]  like a healing wound.  Nice.  Why are you doing that?  You stick your pinky in your nostril, touch the scab in your nose and then smell it?  Yeah.  It doesn't smell awful.  It just smells like an open wound a little bit.  You're healing.  Yeah.  Mustache is looking real good today.  Thank you, Opie.  Tonight will be on TV.  Watch Fox Red Eye late tonight.  I, I will have my mustache on television.  That's good.  Are you shaving the rest?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Of course. 
[02:06:30]  So this mustache really stands out.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to look like Mike Farrell.  What a Mike Farrell 78 stash.  Hey, can we play that phone call before we get out of here?  Yeah, we can do that.  Yeah, let's try this phone call.  Let's just call it the phone call.  Yes.  We like this phone call.  Female trucker.  Female trucker.  Called in.  Hey, I'm tying the bag up.  Did you hear it?  Yeah.  Do it again.  Do it again. 
[02:07:00]  Okay.  All right.  One more time.  Throw it against the window?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Here we go.  And there you have it.  What a trooper she was.  Yeah.  Boy, she was.  She never even had to get out of the truck.  Nope.  Nope, nope, nope.  God, that must have just been horrific in there.  Just park on the side of the road.  No need to walk to anywhere.  Just right there. 
[02:07:30]  Danny found a website called PoopReport.com, right?  Of course he did.  Yeah, there seems to be some amusing stories about the obvious.  Oh, things that we were kind of hitting on?  Yeah, and also I'm getting word that there's a rumor going around that over at XM, somebody  might have had an accident in the bathroom on the floor.  So that just kind of ties to everything.  All right.  Let's ride out of the elevator and all into the bathroom to check out that treat.  I can't wait.  Well, we don't know who, but apparently there was something left on the floor in there. 
[02:08:00]  Happens.  And really fast, we did a lot of visual stuff today.  Go to ONARadio.com and all those links will be up there, right?  Many are up there now.  Thank you, Stunt Brain.  Guys, it was fun today.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday, so, you know, women do the right thing if you see those WOW  stickers today.  That's what WOW means.  Yes.  See me on Red Eye tonight, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  And I'll still have my mustache.  Moustache. 
[02:08:30]  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Moustache. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, my God.  B-double-O-B, boom.  There's a lovely young lady showing her breasts.  Boob, boob, boob.  Get naked, chuck them.  Girls all over the country flashing their lovely boobs.  Guess how many boob dates are they?  Can? I don't have those.  You are spectacular.  Well, me.  Get underneath, get underneath, get underneath, get underneath, get underneath, ponies. 
[02:09:30]  Ah, here we are at XM's satellite radio.  Sirius XM radio, right?  That's what they call it now.  Sirius XM satellite radio.  Radio.  Because Sirius took over XM  I thought it was a merger  Well that's what they like to tell people 
[02:10:00]  Just so people feel good about themselves  It was a hostile takeover  Hostile?  The way Europeans merged with the Native Americans  That were living here  It was pretty hostile  It was a merger  Sure it was  How many people from XM are working for the new company?  Not many  They throw a couple bones in there  Just a few, just a little bit  You know what I hope  And I know Mel listens to our show every day  He's a big fan  Obviously it says Sirius XM Radio 
[02:10:30]  And I think their plan is to just start calling it Sirius eventually  And then phase out the XM part  And I always believe this  XM is the better name  Because it looks like FM or AM  It really is the better name  And I hope they don't get all stupid about that  Because they have pride in their company name  And their logo and everything  But the blue logo with the little doggy  It stinks  It really does  It's kind of silly  XM came up with a great logo 
[02:11:00]  And it just says it all  AM, FM, XM  Simple  But I have no doubt in my mind  The XM is going to go away eventually  And this is all going to be called Sirius  Yeah, eventually  I think you're right  The little doggy, I don't  I never liked that logo  It's going to start for an eye  You can't tell what happened to him  Yeah  You can get punched  I wouldn't wear that logo  No  I wore the XM stuff  Because it kind of looked cool, you know  Yeah, it got a good logo  Mm-hmm  Rob Halford wears the XM hat a lot  Does he really?  I saw a priest  They were so good at Eddie Trunk's birthday party 
[02:11:30]  It was like 500 people  They did it for Eddie  25 years of radio he's been doing in New York  And they were so fucking good live  Nice  Damn Judas Priest  Yeah  So  But Halford was just wearing  They were like kind of wearing  Like their hangout clothes  Because it was 500 people  And he had his little XM hat on  How many balls have been on the underside of the brim  Probably a lot  Of that hat  I'm going to guess more than two  Although not as many as you think though  Because I imagine Halford will top you  You think Halford is a top  Please  Tough guy  He's the type that will fuck you with his boots on  And his hand just kind of holding the small of your back 
[02:12:00]  So you can't squirm away  As he puts that fucking  Oh shit  As that fucking piece of British steel  Rips your asshole to shreds  Ha ha  And he fucking  He turns your electric eye into a bleeding brown one  He rocks your ass right  Oh I'm sure he does  Yeah  He just rocks it  I bet you he fucks angry  Like you probably try to talk to him  And he probably just goes  Oh my god  Quiet  Shut up  They were so fucking good live  Yeah  Judas Priest  I don't think I've ever seen Judas Priest live  I hadn't dude  And I went and saw them again 
[02:12:30]  When I saw Motorhead and Heaven and Hell and them  And they were just fucking tremendous  His full show  When they were all dressed  It's like the beard is creepy  But it actually kind of works  With the long leather trenches  And stuff that he's wearing  The stage show is great  What do you mean  He's got a beard  He has a little goatee  Yeah he's got a goatee thing  He's had that for a while now  Hey  He's a jazz catcher  Speaking of music  I want to like  Maybe turn people on to something  That maybe they don't know about today  I like to do this from time to time  Really?  I have a bad wing 
[02:13:00]  And I'm getting like physical therapy  And doing a lot of working out  And I ran into the Knicks  Ex-trainer  He was around when Patrick Ewing  Was playing for the Knicks  A great guy  Named  Siad  Is that how you say that name?

Well if you watch Lost  Saeed okay  No Saeed  I don't watch Lost  I'm sorry  Enough with your dumb scab  Please  I can't help it  It just feels good to touch it 
[02:13:30]  No I'm just  I'm just trying to push it up a little bit  And see where it's at  Because I have stitches in here  Dude I would pull it right out  No I can't do that  I would do it  You get stitches you bleed  Sorry  But you gotta pull it out  Stitches  Snitches get stitches  I've heard that  So I was never a tattletale  Brooklyn Ace  How many days are up in your contracts?

I think they should have hired Francesca  Do you?  Yeah you know  My two cents  In my humble opinion  Alan  And he's talking about like being New York centric  And then someone called him out  And said well Francesca has a much thicker New York accent  And sounds much more local  And he roots for all New York teams 
[02:14:30]  Whereas Mad Dog has kind of like a  It's not as heavy a New York accent  He's a Giants fan  And he's like well I'm talking about attitude too  He just never admits that he's wrong on a point  No  Follow the money  We got it  Follow the money  I heard you the 78th time you said that  I've said it before  I can't get enough of him though  I like Alan  But he's a fucking boob  Yeah he just doesn't really know  No he doesn't  He's a fucking buffoon  All his followers think he really knows stuff  And he doesn't  He's clickety clacking on his keyboard  Yeah  Posting while he's

[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Well, I'm reminded that the bass player used to be  one of Letterman's band, guys.  Oh, okay.  No, he's actually Jimmy Vavino  from the Max Weinberg 7 on Conan.  No, I know.  There's one from Conan.  Oh, there's also one from Letterman, too?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My bad.  They're all in cahoots, those guys?  I think the bass player used to play with Paul and stuff.  Who's playing drums?  Is it Doc Severinsen?  Doc Severinsen.  Is he playing the horns?  Doc Severinsen's going kooka-kooka. 
[02:22:30]  That's not an easy song to pull off right there.  He did a great version of that.  Yeah, so...  Vocally, the guy did a great job,  and then, instrumentally, it's...  All right, we get it.  It was good.  You know, you're right.  Why am I crowing over this song?  Why not?  Fuck them.  Who are you, Brian Epstoon?  You know, because they're fat foe a little different.  Yeah, well, sure.  John in DC, how are you, buddy?  Opie, what's up, bud?  Hey.  Hey, about a year or so ago,  there's a movie that came out called Across the Universe. 
[02:23:00]  I have that.  Hold on.  Can I stop you for a second, John?  Yeah.  I see that on demand,  that same fucking commercial over and over again.  Is it a good movie?  You know what?  It's a decent movie.  You can get past some bullshit in it,  some of the hippie nonsense,  but this version of I Am the Walrus  sounds exactly like the version Bono does in the movie.  I mean, you could YouTube it and check it out.  Yeah, we'll check it out.  I have my friend Kim used to work for somebody in New York,  Peggy Siegel, who does all the big parties and stuff, 
[02:23:30]  and she was raving about this movie before it came out.  Across the universe?  She fucking went on and on about it,  and I have it and I haven't seen it.  Long way to go, just to reiterate that I haven't seen it.  Who gives a shit?  Did you see that?  It's amazing.  No one could give a shit less than they do about that story.  Yeah.  Jeff in Jersey.  What's up, Jeff?  Excuse my interruption.  The game is...  All right, forget it.  I didn't mean to say excuse my interruption.  You go right ahead.  Nothing stops this guy.  Apparently he's got that fucking... 
[02:24:00]  Plow through.  Yeah, plow right through.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that?  We didn't hear you, dude.  Could you just stop just talking to nobody right now?  There's gigas today.  It's amazing.  Oh, Jesus.  Welcome to Man Who Never Had A Conversation on the phone dot com.  It's a new website.  You're a great band.  Very good fans.  I heard they're very good.  When are they going to be at Radio City?  We didn't hear you.  September 20th.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, okay.  Thanks a lot.  Keep talking.  I didn't mean to pardon my interruption, but you go right ahead.  Usually when you say excuse my interruption, somebody pauses and allows you to interrupt  and then they go back.  But not...  Oh, wow. 
[02:24:30]  Not fucking Sir Chats a lot.  No Sir through.  He barrels right through.  He must be a fun guy to be in a relationship with.  You know, I have knees that are being in.  The game's going to be over at 7 o'clock and then I want to go out and grab a dinner.  You know, my mother's got candy.  I want to get home.  I get up out of work.  Jesus Christ.  That guy sure was a chatty fucking Cathy doll.  I hope he's dead right now.  I hope something happened and he died.  I hope he was talking and didn't hear the truck horn.  Maybe he was just a little nervous.  How nervous is he?  What happened?  You get nervous and his fucking ears shut off? 
[02:25:00]  What happened?  His cochlea doesn't work?  Is that how you say it?  Oh, the cock...  The cochlea?  Cochlea.  Yeah, sure.  Not to be confused with your cocclicks.  Oh, cocclicks is the tailbone that some of us have lost due to evolution.  And a cochlea is the ear thing or cochlea?  Did he say some?  I didn't...  Cochlea.  He did not just say some.  Yes, he did.  Brilliant to Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, Will fucking Jimmy. 
[02:25:30]  Thank you, Mike, from FMQB.com.  Yes, it's Will Lee from Letterman's band there.  Okay.  Or Paul's band, whatever, that plays on Letterman.  And now he's doing the Beatles thing.  Apparently Mike has a little Google function, too.  How bad was Stumpering without his laptop doing it?  He was like fucking...  He was almost as smart as E-Rock.  Wow.  He made fucking E-Rock look like fucking...  Put smart guy in here.  Yeah.  We got Roy, Dan, Hollander.  Oh, good.  I want to talk to this guy. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, Jimmy turned us on to what Roy is all about.  Roy, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, my friend.  Thanks for having a serial anti-feminist on your show.  I appreciate it.  Well, Roy...  That's what they're calling you.  You were in the Post or the Daily News yesterday about suing Columbia University for, what, the  women's studies programs?  Right.  Now, let me ask you, too, because I thought this was interesting.  You've sued nightclubs for ladies' night because of, you know, they're saying they're 
[02:26:30]  charging men more.  And you're also...  You're suing for the Violence Against Women Act you're calling unconstitutional for allowing  alien females to acquire citizenship by falsely accusing their American husbands of mistreatment.  So what is exactly driving you at this?  I'm sorry.  Say that last minute.  What is exactly driving you at this?  What's driving me is justice.  I'm tired of having my rights violated.  I'm tired of seeing this society, which for the last 40 years has been spending over backwards  or perhaps forward, to give girls preferential treatment at the expense of the rights of 
[02:27:00]  men.  Have you got...  I'm sorry.  Have you gotten anywhere legally with it?  Like, with...  Especially with the...  The one thing I...  My first instinct was I liked the fact that the ladies' nights...  Because basically men allow that just to get the broads in to get them drunk and fuck  them.  So it's almost to our advantage to have a ladies' night.  But it always kind of annoyed me that they have it.  Have you gotten anywhere with that?  No.  All the cases are pending.  What happens when you bring a case of this nature is the first inning is the opposition,  the defendants, make motions to dismiss. 
[02:27:30]  So in the ladies' nights, the motion for dismissal was made.  I filed my papers and there's been no decision on that.  Okay.  In the Violence Against Women Act, Women's Act, I am presently putting together my papers  to oppose the government's dismissal motion.  So there's obviously no decision on that yet.  And on this Women's Studies program, it just started.  Well, Roy, I'm leaving...  I'd like to go back to ladies' nights.  Okay.  Think of the amount of money that is transferred from the pockets of guys to the pocketbooks 
[02:28:00]  of girls over all that time.  And then you determine the present value of that.  And also, in New York City, when I go out to clubs, I generally find probably a 50-50 mix  of girls and guys at clubs that charge girls the same.  But at ladies' nights, there's usually more guys.  Okay.  And let me ask you, too, about the...  Before we get to the Columbia thing, which I think I agree with you on, like, the Violence 
[02:28:30]  Against Women Act, I mean, look, there is obviously...  Are you saying that the idea is unconstitutional because it says women in it?  Because I almost don't mind this one.  Because let's be honest.  I mean, common sense dictates that in domestic violence cases, it's almost always a guy hurting  a woman.  I mean, what is your contention?  Who mouths off?  Well, I'm not saying that she wasn't lippy.  That's really untrue.  I mean, I can't...  There's some studies that were done by the Department of Justice, and there's an organization  called Radar, which have a lot of papers on that. 
[02:29:00]  And what it comes down to, domestic violence is just about equally between the girl and  the guy.  However, the girl, in 70% of the time, uses a weapon, as opposed to a guy might use a weapon  in 20%.  What is...  Okay.  What is the case, say, of how many...  What kind of statistics do you have on how many women were killed by the violence of a  spouse or an ex-spouse, or how many men were killed by the violence of an ex-spouse?  I think you're going to find that it's much more in one direction.  You know, in that, in that, and when you're talking about, and that's what I was going 
[02:29:30]  to get into, when you're talking about the injuries that result, more girls are injured  by a guy, husband, or boyfriend, you know, accosting them, than vice versa.  But I think it's not as much as you may think.  I think it may be, say, 60-40.  So 60% of the girls are seriously injured, and 40% of the guys are seriously injured.  So if you look at...  If you look at some of the studies, you know, you'll see it's different than the common-sense 
[02:30:00]  impression.  But concerning the Women's Studies Program, the problem with the program is that it is  giving a benefit to females, and it's not giving a similar benefit to guys.  Which is what?  Well, the benefits are, it's not just...  See, the Women's Studies Program is not just courses.  It's also networking, it's finding jobs, it's finding, you know, support and help in all  different areas. 
[02:30:30]  Now, that is geared towards females.  So think of women's studies as the varsity sport of campus co-eds.  And then compare that to what Title IX of the Education Amendment have been doing to varsity  sports for men.  Title IX says if you have a varsity sport for men, you have to provide the same opportunities  for the females.  So you have a varsity sport or actually an educational program, because Title IX also  applies to educational programs of women's studies, which primarily benefits females. 
[02:31:00]  Well, I agree.  I don't know whether to agree with you or disagree with you in a weird way, because I  do agree with you on something like, like at Columbia especially, they have like black  female study, all these things that are obsessively focusing on a gender or a race or both, and it's  perfectly acceptable.  However, if you focus it, and I know we don't, I'm not saying we need white people study, but  if you focused it negatively on a gender or a race, they wouldn't allow it.  But because you're focusing it in a way that they deem ideologically acceptable, they allow 
[02:31:30]  it.  Well, I've come across that argument, well, what about black studies?  And my response to that is quite simply, when was the last time a feminist was lynched?  Shot dead on the front stoop of her house or on the back of any of the hotel she was staying  in?  Well, you're...  Let me just finish.  Okay.  There's no comparison.  For the past 400 years, the institutions of this nation have kept their boot heels on  the back of the necks of blacks.  During that same time, white, white feminists and the average white girl have received nothing 
[02:32:00]  but preferential...  You mean the same race of people that are now ready to step into the presidency, it  looks like?  Jesus Christ, dude.  I mean...  I mean, no, no, I'm not buying that argument.  I think if you're against this female studies thing, then black programs like that, black studies,  it's the same hypocrisy and the same discrimination as these women's programs.  You're giving preferential treatment based on nothing but race. 
[02:32:30]  And why should people that are not getting that benefit have to make up for this 400 years  of a boot heel, like you say, being on the neck when we never did anything?  You're talking about ancient history.  And don't forget, women were not violently kept down the way, but women, in fairness,  their rights were not equal to that of men for hundreds of years. 
[02:33:00]  Maybe it wasn't 400 years and they didn't face the lynching and the violence, but it was  300 years and they were certainly not given the same rights or the same treatment under  the law or the same pay.  You're right.  They didn't have a right to be drafted and sent to Vietnam.  52,000 American men died, eight.  Eight females.  They didn't have the right to go in and work in those sweatshops for the robber barons during  the 1800s.  No, but they also fought for the rights to work.  You're right.  They were discriminated against.  But was the discrimination beneficial to them or harmful? 
[02:33:30]  Was the discrimination based upon prejudice or not?  They were discriminated against, but not to the extent that blacks were.  Maybe not.  Okay, so what you're saying is that they should allow black studies because they suffered  a nine and women's studies shouldn't be allowed because they suffered a five and a half or  a six.  Yeah, where do you draw the line?  Yeah, what's your exact barometer?  I would draw the line at that because black studies is not an ideological or belief system.  It's history that was previously ignored by Americans.  It's so agenda-driven. 
[02:34:00]  It's very agenda-driven.  Come on, man.  You can't deny that certain types of colleges that have racially oriented courses are not  agenda.  They call them history revisionists.  I mean, sometimes it's right to revise the history, and other times it's just putting a  negative slant on what was already said.  Yeah, well, I don't have a problem with that.  I don't have a problem with a group of people distinguished by the color of their skin coming  up with their own history.  That's not what I have a problem with.  You never hear coming out of black studies lunatic syndromes that the females use to 
[02:34:30]  murder the unborn, murder newborn, murder their husbands, murder their boyfriends, murder  their children, and get away with it or receive minimal punishment.  You never hear that coming from a black studies, someone saying, well, if I'm black, I should  get away with this murder.  Really?  Like the fact that William Kunstler tried to use black rage as a defense for Colin Ferguson?  Yeah, I know.  William Kunstler was the one aberration, which always happens. 
[02:35:00]  No, but there's black studies programs have been under a lot of scrutiny and gotten a lot  of criticism because a lot of their speakers, their guest speakers, some of the professors  have come out with some outlandishly, horribly racist remarks.  And like I said before, it's very agenda driven.  I'm not saying all of them.  I'm sure there are some nice groups that get together and want to talk about history.  But, you know, to say that it's different than the women's studies and any less or any 
[02:35:30]  more inappropriate or yeah, it's kind of silly constitutional rights.  What's that?  Actually, it's not appropriate or inappropriate.  It's violating your conscience.  However you want to phrase it, whatever semantics you want to use.  Okay, fine.  Semantics.  That's what the lawsuit's based on.  Well, I disagree with your take on that.  I think women's studies programs are fundamentally different.  Okay, so you think it's based on gender, bad, based on race, good? 
[02:36:00]  No.  Well, first of all, I don't use the term race because there is no such thing as race.  Of course there is.  You're really talking about the differentiation in color of skin.  There hasn't been another.  No, you don't think you don't.  Semantics.  You don't think there are cultural differences between people of different, like, I'll use  the word races, that are based on things other than just skin color?  Like, you don't think that...  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.  The fundamental distinction that is made is based upon color, but people use the term race 
[02:36:30]  and scientifically and genetically speaking, race is a term that doesn't exist.  It's non-existent.  But you understand the common use that the word has when we're discussing it.  So to play a game of semantics, you go, well, technically, guys, I mean, come on.  We all know what we're talking about when we say race.  We all know you talk about black people or white people.  You understand that.  Oh, when you're talking about black and white, you're talking about color, that's fine.  But I just want to add in a little quote from George Orwell. 
[02:37:00]  Well, if thought can corrupt speech, speech can corrupt thought.  When you start using race, it brings out the connotation that there's a fundamental biological,  physical...  No, it doesn't.  You don't...  The fact that you would put a negative spin on it...  Maybe I'm older than you, and maybe it's because of the time that I grew up in.  Right.  I don't know.  Do you remember when women couldn't vote, or no?  I don't know if you want to go back to the women's studies.  Well, we're just getting into an ideological thing, because I was kind of for what you were  doing, but now it just seems like it's almost like you're a special interest parody, like 
[02:37:30]  I'm the guy who goes after the women's causes, like the guy in California who was fighting  the Pledge of Allegiance.  It almost like...  I'm just listening to your reasoning, and to me, it's a complete...  It's very sectional, as opposed to like, yeah, this is how I feel.  We should all be given the same amount of X, Y, and Z.  You have it specifically for women.  I should say, I almost said a hard-on for women, but you know what I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I know what you mean. 
[02:38:00]  I can see your point of view.  I respect your point of view.  That's not how I see it.  The fact that you...  I see what I'm trying to do...  Right.  ...is to eliminate the constitutional violation of men's rights by feminism.  The fact that you think...  That's what I'm trying to...  ...that domestic violence is fairly close in the people who are doing the beating and  being beaten...  I don't say that at the Department of Justice...  I don't buy that.  I don't buy it.  Go to the Department of Justice Studies website. 
[02:38:30]  I'd like to look at that.  The one thing I would believe is that the domestic violence is obviously more against women than  men, but I think women will use it, especially in court, and say that they were violated...  I only mean legitimate cases.  ...or assaulted...  ...when they actually weren't in order to get the guy in trouble.  Sure.  Now, that I've seen happen.  But as far as a 40-60 split of violence against men and women... 
[02:39:00]  You know, yeah, I don't know.  I'll look that up.  I know where the website is for the Department of Justice and the stats and stuff.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying it's a 50-50 split of domestic violence, the way domestic violence is defined  under the Violence Against Women Act.  What I'm saying is serious injuries is probably 60% female, 40% guys.  That's what I'm saying.  And look it up.  If I'm wrong, you know, go on the air and say that I'm a jerk and a liar. 
[02:39:30]  No, I don't think you're a jerk and a liar.  I just think that the fact that this...  What bothers me is that there's such an inconsistency in your view of what is okay to stress.  Like, and I agree with you on feminism in one point.  I think in the old days, it used to be...  Feminists used to be about wrecking roles.  Like, hey, blue doesn't have to be for boys.  Pink doesn't have to be for girls.  Girls can do this.  Boys can do this.  I think it was a lot about removing roles and these bullshit little things we get...  Corners we get painted into. 
[02:40:00]  And then it turned into men are bad.  I kind of like the fact that you're going after these studies because I think that the women's studies shit annoys me.  But the fact that you have all these excuses as to why racial studies are okay,  they're the same excuses used to justify women's studies.  Well, my belief is that's not so.  My belief is that the black studies programs do not wreck the same type of harm to constitutional rights  that the feminist program is. 
[02:40:30]  And I take it you're pro-choice because you mentioned that, right?  You know, you can criticize my belief system.  That's fine.  But that's what I believe.  And I believe I have grounds for that.  Why do you hate women?  I don't...  You can't hate that which you lust after.  So it's not females.  So you lust after women?  Let me finish this.  Let me finish this.  Sure.  Not the females I hate.  It's the feminists that I despise.  When I go to a club and I'm trying to find some girl, hit on some girl,  if I come across a feminist, I move on. 
[02:41:00]  How do you know she's a feminist?  Hairy armpits.  Go ahead.  How do you know she's a feminist?  Well, when she starts...  When I use the term girl, she tries to tell me to use the term woman.  Or sometimes...  Oh, man.  I'm a guy.  Wait.  It's pretty obvious.  But wait a minute.  And you also mentioned, like...  You mentioned, like, the fact they want to kill the unborn.  Like, so you got basically a pro-life stance, and you're annoyed at all these...  You got a weird thing with women.  This is not just about the Constitution. 
[02:41:30]  And I think you're being dishonest with yourself and everybody else  if you don't just say exactly what it is.  Like, the fact that you...  Wait, wait, wait.  Did you read the VAWA case?  The what?  Well, okay.  I have a website that has a Violence Against Women Act case.  I have three lawsuits, okay?  Mm-hmm.  There's a Ladies' Nights lawsuit.  There's a lawsuit against the Violence Against Women Act.  And there's this lawsuit against women's studies.  If you read the complaint on the Violence Against Women Act,  you will see the tipping point that pushed me into this effort 
[02:42:00]  to stop the feminism from violating guys' rights.  And that was pretty much the Edgar Allan Poe horror of divorce  that I went through about seven years ago.  So that's the tipping point, if you're looking for the immediate motivation.  Okay, now I see where his motivation came from.  Ever since it started many years ago.  Because I knew it was just another special interest group  trying to get what they don't deserve.  Hey, Roy, it seems like it's a waste of time to go after the clubs and all.  Why don't you go after, like, lawyers that are defending women in divorce cases? 
[02:42:30]  Because that seems to be way out of whack and way out.  There's no balance there whatsoever.  Yeah, that's a problem.  The guy gets screwed almost every single time in a divorce case.  That seems like it would do more good than going after club owners  because they have a ladies' night.  I mean, you're right about that.  I mean, a lot of these lawyers, they'll tell the lady what they should say,  basically what the lie is.  The lawyer sits there and says, well, if you say this, you'll get this.  If you say that, you won't get that. 
[02:43:00]  And that's what they do.  Well, why don't you just try to change the system?  There's no way I can sue those guys because I have to be,  whether I bring the action myself or I bring a class action,  I have to be injured.  Now, that's an interesting point.  You may be able to do a class action, but it would be against,  that's interesting.  Maybe that can be done.  A bunch of guys who have been screwed over by their wives' lawyers.  There you go.  And bring actually a mass tort against them.  I like that.  Did your ex punch you in the face? 
[02:43:30]  Let me think about that.  That's a good idea.  I never thought about that.  Did your ex punch you in the face?  Because something's going on here.  I'm sorry, can you say that again?  I'm being serious.  Did your ex punch you in the face?  I know you are.  Yeah, did you have some violence at home?  Did your ex-wife punch you or something?  Well, she came at me with a knife twice,  but I know martial arts, so that was no problem.  You see, it wasn't the experience with my ex-wife.  Okay.  It was the experience that I went through when I was in a divorce court.  I had a judge laugh at me in the divorce court. 
[02:44:00]  My ex-wife is a member of the Russian mafia.  She's a Russian mafia prostitute.  Now, she had a couple of her goons threatening me.  I went to the FBI with the tape recording.  The FBI calls me up and says,  well, we found out who the guy was.  I said, who is the guy?  And they say, we can't tell you.  We don't want to violate the guy's privacy.  And then the FBI tells me,  oh, don't open your door to anybody you don't know  and be careful when you go out in public.  The FBI told me this.  So let me ask you a question.  Sounds like good advice.  It's the treatment that I receive from the courts, FBI, police, 
[02:44:30]  and immigration and naturalization.  But, Roy, they were protecting a guy.  That privacy thing was protecting his right, not her.  Yeah, that's right.  It was protecting his right.  The guy that's threatening me is protecting his right.  Can I ask you how you ended up with a Russian prostitute mobster?  Sure.  I was working as an acting manager for Kroll Associates in Moscow. 
[02:45:00]  And Kroll Associates is pretty much a private detective agency.  And I came home one evening when I first got into town,  and there was an apartment party in my building.  So I crashed the party, and that's where I met her.  Oh, Jesus.  But the problem is, it turned out it wasn't just an apartment party.  It was the office of a modeling call girl prostitution ring.  Lucky you moving in right next door.  Wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow.  Very nice. 
[02:45:30]  Very nice.  You're going to like this part.  Great success.  When she was a teenager, she was a mistress to a Chechen warlord.  Really?  Now, how did I find all this out?  Because Kroll Associates uses guys in the KGB,  well, actually, it's now the FSB in military intelligence,  to find out information.  So after things started going nutso,  I asked some guys in Newham Russian military intelligence to check her out.  And that's what I found out.  Wow.  Roy, is the Violence Against Women Act,  the unconstitutional thing you're going, 
[02:46:00]  is it simply because it allows alien women to acquire citizenship  by falsely accusing their husbands or ex-husbands of mistreatment?  Is that the part of it you're going after?  That's the part of it, but that's not exactly correct.  The problem is that when the girl accuses her husband of mistreating her,  right away the government makes everything secret from the husband.  Okay.  If the husband provides any evidence, the government will discard the evidence.  It doesn't matter where the evidence comes from, say,  the next president of the United States. 
[02:46:30]  If it goes through the hands of the husband, the government will discard it.  And the government relies mainly upon a sworn affidavit of an alien  who wants to become a permanent resident so she can become a citizen.  So what does the actual, it's an unconstitutional Violence Against Women Act,  what is the wording of it that you want changed?  Oh, I want, there are certain provisions which provide for what I just told you about.  Everywhere it says woman, put in cunt. 
[02:47:00]  There are certain provisions that I want declared unconstitutional.  That means they no longer exist, such as the secrecy.  So what I'm looking for is that when an alien wife accuses her husband of mistreating her,  and it may be true or it may be false,  then the husband has the right to appear and defend himself.  Right.  That's all I'm asking.  It's the same, if you marry an American girl and she accuses you of domestic violence, 
[02:47:30]  you get to show up in court.  I mean, the judge might laugh at you, but at least you're in court.  But so that's the part of it.  So you're not against the Violence Against Women Act,  you're against a part of it that allows that to happen.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, so it's important to ask because the knee-jerk reaction is to be,  how could you be against Violence Against Women Act?  But it's just that part which is perverted and misused to really fuck guys over  and not allow them to hear the evidence.  Right, and that's why the act was called Violence Against Women Act,  so that people would get a knee-jerk reaction. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, right, because...  That's got to be good.  Yeah, yeah.  Who would be against that, right?  You've got to understand, the feminists admit this,  that they created that act, and they got it passed.  And after it was passed, some even laughed at the legislatures for passing it.  They admit that.  Hmm.  Well, the feminism, I think you're right about them,  and I also think you go way too far with it.  And you don't acknowledge the shitty history women have had.  And you make it look like women can do anything and we can do nothing.  And it's like, it's just, even though I think a lot of times you're right,  like divorce cases, and there are many times where they're given the benefit of the doubt, 
[02:48:30]  and it's annoying, and there are women's studies groups which are annoying.  You're making it look like things have always been equal,  and women have never had any trouble in the U.S.,  and I just think you're allowing your irritation at your ex-wife,  or your probably justifiable hatred of this woman,  to really fucking skewer your way of looking at things.  That's just my opinion on why, because I'm listening to it,  it almost sounds like a special interest parody, like I said before.  Well, actually, you know, I mean, besides, definitely, yeah, I hate my ex-wife, 
[02:49:00]  but it's really the hatred that I experienced at the hands of the system,  which I now refer to as the feminist establishment.  But let me ask you a question.  Sure.  If I were to go out and, say, machine gun a bunch of feminists at a convention,  and then I were to argue PMS, persecuted male syndrome, how far do you think I'd get?  No, exactly what you deserve to get, nowhere.  And it's like, that's just silly.  So when a girl kills, when some girl shotguns her husband in the back and gets seven months, 
[02:49:30]  that doesn't just seem something wrong.  Yeah, just like it seems wrong for a lot of, you're taking a thing,  there's a real physical thing women have with PMS.  Everyone knows they get cunty.  And you're looking at times where the law has allowed some slick lawyer to pull that shit off,  but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  I mean, it's just, that's a silly example you're giving.  No, that's not a silly example.  Of course it is.  That happened.  A girl shotgunned her husband and got seven months.  How often does that happen, though?  No, it was premeditated murder.  Okay, so the point is, let's take it back to one step. 
[02:50:00]  The feminists are always arguing for equality.  Okay, so if girls and guys aren't equal,  then the law should be a change to reflect the fact that they aren't equal.  And so girls should, so what I'm trying to do is,  well, if feminists want to be treated equally for everything that's beneficial,  or for mostly everything that's beneficial in society,  I'm trying to use the argument, okay, you want equality?  Here, take the worst of society.  And my belief is, this is my strategy, 
[02:50:30]  my belief is then if that can be successful,  they'll change their tune,  and we'll go back to a rational situation where, yeah,  girls and guys are different.  When was it rational?  Well, girls and guys are different.  It's funny, like, you don't mind that,  but, like, you have a problem with the racial differential.  Like, oh, no, there's no difference.  Or, like, I don't like that race doesn't exist,  but yet with gender, you have a definite, a hard cement wall.  Well, scientifically speaking, race doesn't exist.  I mean, that's, I'm sorry.  You know, you do your research, scientifically speaking.  But socially, it does exist.  But socially, it doesn't exist. 
[02:51:00]  Socially, it does exist.  You're talking about difference in skin color  and maybe the difference in the part of town,  socially, town or country that they can.  That's why I said socially.  I don't think there is a fundamental distinction.  Again, that's what.  I don't feel I'm being discriminated against by anybody of a different color.  Again, Roy, that's why I said socially.  For the fifth time, I said socially.  Okay, socially.  It does matter.  Okay, social.  Okay.  So, I don't know.  Do you feel that hip-hop discriminates against you?  No, but I do think that hip-hop is allowed to get away 
[02:51:30]  with certain language and certain expressions  that would get me as an artist in trouble.  Wait a minute.  Listen to some of the language you just used on your show.  You used that word C-U-N-T?  Cunt, yes.  We were all adults.  Nobody's going to give you a hard time.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm not talking about uncensored talk,  but I'm talking about racial language.  Come on.  How do you not know that?  I don't know.  I mean, I take a hip-hop class.  I don't have a problem.  Well, how old a guy are you?  I hang out with a lot of guys. 
[02:52:00]  Wait, you take a hip-hop class?  What do you mean?  I take a hip-hop class.  What is that?  Well, it's a class that teaches you how to dance hip-hop.  I can't.  I just go because there's like 30 or 40 girls in it.  How old a guy are you?  Well, I'm not going to tell you how old I am.  Why?  I can't answer any question you ask, but I will not.  You go to a hip-hop class because there's 30 women there?  Yeah.  There's like 30 or 40 girls there.  They're not women.  They're girls.  You're going after all this.  And they're 20s.  You won't even say how old you are?  That's the way a woman thinks.  You're a guy.  It's for the same reason.  I mean, if I tell you guys how old I am and it gets out, 
[02:52:30]  then when I go hit on some pretty young girl at a nightclub,  I can't exploit her infinite capacity to delude herself into thinking I'm younger.  Give me a break.  That's just silly.  I'm not going to stab myself in the back that way.  Why?  You don't think that a lot of times women like an older, more successful guy.  That's just phony.  You're phony, dude.  I hate you.  You're fucking phony.  Is this guy for real?  No.  He's a phony.  You want to get pussy.  You're mad that you're not getting pussy.  I'm not getting nasty.  It's the truth.  You take a hip-hop class. 
[02:53:00]  You're probably 50 years old.  Stop with the name calling.  You're fucking phony.  I'm calling you a name.  Oh, now, now.  Okay, okay.  This is my...  I have to answer from home, but this is my response to your accusation.  Yes.  Peru turns a blind eye to dueling.  Exactly.  And old white men should not take hip-hop classes.  That's my answer to you.  Give me a call.  Do the hokey pokey for Pete's sake.  Be who you are.  The hokey pokey.  Don't be mad that you're not fucking hip and relevant and women are ignoring you. 
[02:53:30]  How desperate are you for pussy that you've got to go to,  a hip-hop class?  Dude, that's what I'm talking about.  And look at Snitch.  He'll fucking walk up to a girl and go,  Hi, girls.  And then wonder why they want to be called women.  Well, then start calling the women and learn how to get assed.  Why should I censor my speech for a special interest group that doesn't have my interest at heart?  Okay, then don't be mad when they don't fuck you.  It doesn't have my interest at heart.  Don't be mad when they...  I'm not going to say what they want me to say.  Oh, but you'll lie about your age?  You'll humiliate yourself by lying about your age?  You want to be an androgyny. 
[02:54:00]  You want to be a slave to some fat slob over-the-hill feminazi who can't be...  Me?  I don't try to fuck them.  If it's a car or Saba Quadratic, then you go and do it.  I don't try to fuck them, kiddo.  You're the one who can't get laid.  If you've engaged in, then let's go down to Peru and have a duel.  I don't try to fuck those women.  Sir, we all fuck women in their 20s, okay?  Yeah.  Guys, guys, I don't know how long you want to go on.  I got a call from some other...  Is it a feminazi?  Tee hee!  No, it's just some Irish.  Roy, a lot of women call, and then they say that you just hate women. 
[02:54:30]  I want to put...  He doesn't get laid, and that's his problem.  I want to put Elizabeth on the line with Roy.  Elizabeth from Westchester.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  You guys just totally nailed it.  This is all about him looking for ways to control women, because he can't get them on his own.  That's why he calls them girls, and he gets mad about calling them women, and why he won't  pick on the blacks, because he's afraid of them.  Yep, exactly.  Overpower women.  And, you know, go back to Carlos Mencia two years ago at your virus tour, did a whole rant  about how women were... 
[02:55:00]  Well, he might have stole...  I don't know, but he did a whole rant about how women had less rights than black men.  Shut up, you whole...  Who did that?  Nobody.  He said, that's not true.  I can't go...  I can't go out and murder a baby that I have and get away with.  There you go.  It's ridiculous.  No wonder what...  You're pro-choice.  It's agenda.  It's all fucking horseshit agenda.  All the confuses don't get laid.  It's absolutely right.  All right, thank you, Liz.  People with darker skin.  It's females.  They're the ones...  I mean, you go to court, you might be able to get justice if the person you're up against 
[02:55:30]  has a different color of skin, but you're not going to get justice if the person  up against...  And this is what tips me off, dude.  You say something like...  Hold on, hold on.  How much longer do you guys want to go?  Hold on.  Let me ask you, you say something like, why should I change the way I talk to a piece  of fat feminazi?  Well, in the bar, when you're hitting on a girl and you call her a girl and she gets  mad at you, why are you trying to fuck fat feminazis?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I don't go after feminazis.  Well, then, what was that stupid example for?  If I'm hitting on a girl and I find out that she's a professional, I move on.  If you talk to a girl and you find out she's a professional, you move on? 
[02:56:00]  You move on.  You move on to the next girl.  Why?  You can't...  You're not mad enough to fuck a girl who has a good job?  There's 3.3 billion girls out there.  And you've got to find a weak one, you cornball?  An average sexual life...  Oh, you've got a Russian bride.  And what do you end up with?  You fuck...  Russian male bride.  You're a cornball.  Working on their first night.  You find out she's a professional, you've got to move on.  Why don't you fucking learn how to bang chicks?  That's my personal choice.  And you can fucking learn how to pull a lawyer's hair and spank her.  So, you guys have really... 
[02:56:30]  Turning this into a...  Dude, I'm listening to you.  You're phony.  First of all, pack situation, which I'm going to probably go through up at close...  Because it's the truth.  You won't even say your age.  Why should I change the way I talk?  Why should I tell you?  What's that?  Why should I tell you my age?  That's none of your business.  Why should I change the way I talk?  You want to find out through some research.  Because you're an old white guy who's mad that he can't get young ass.  Why don't you just admit that?  And you're bitter.  That's not what's going on.  Of course it is.  That's not what's going on.  Well, you can make...  Look, you can make all the... 
[02:57:00]  They killed the unborn.  Hi, girls.  Who's going to fuck you?  You want to talk about the issues of this case or you just want to rant against you?  Because the issues of the case are being driven by your personally being a zero.  You want to talk about the issues of this case?  We did.  You want to rant against me because you don't believe what I believe.  No, I'm really against you because I'm looking at your picture right now and you're an older,  balding, white gentleman, which is fine.  Is there another host there which...  We're all hosts.  I can ask that I have a...  I have to go to this other interview that I scheduled. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, you guys think you...  Well...  What Jimmy was saying is very...  You're fucking phony, dude.  What Jimmy's saying is very valid.  We were talking about your points here and your lawsuits, but then we found out through  talking with you a little longer that they are very personally driven and you have an  agenda that is not based so much on justice, like you say, and more so it's just based  on your personal vendetta, perhaps. 
[02:58:00]  Well, you got the personal is political and I view it as justice and then you might view  it as vengeance, but look up justice and vengeance and they pretty much have a...  No, you know...  How about a...  Hi, girls.  I mean, that's fine.  Your take on it.  Hi, girls.  How are you?  Can I buy you a drink?  Beat it, old man.  Can I go to my interview?  No, you can't.  Is that allowed?  I don't want to talk to a professional girl.  I got to bring one over from another country and then get mad when she fucks somebody who's  a bouncer and burns me.  She burned you, dude.  The other host.  Roy, I got to tell you something. 
[02:58:30]  Jimmy brought you to our attention and he was so on your side.  I was on your side.  Wow.  And now I think he hates you.  Well, that's fine.  I mean, you know.  You're a phony.  He's talking to me.  He now can...  I listen to your horse shit on the racial issue.  You're a phony.  That's fine.  You're a little...  I take a hip hop class, but I won't tell you how old I am like a fucking chick.  Will you guys excuse me?  Sure.  Roy, you got to put your tampon in, you fucking woman.  Okay, Roy. 
[02:59:00]  Jimmy, if you...  You know, Jimmy, you can call me back and we can go down to Peru, okay?  If you got the guts, which I don't think you got.  Go down where?  Go down where?  To have a little duel, Jimmy.  A Peru?  You obviously don't have the guts.  Wait, Peru?  Peru for what?  What are you talking about?  They allow dueling?  What are we doing Peru?  Dueling.  Peru turns a blind eye to duelings.  They allow dueling?  Oh, what a fucking asshole.  I challenge you to a duel.  How about this?  That's fucking childish.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  Please substitute Anthony.  Can we do that?  I would love to duel with this guy. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, you don't want to engage in impersonal attacks.  Yes, I do.  I don't like you because I think you're fucking phony.  It's obviously that you have a tough time getting broads.  We can argue that over the telephone.  Why do we need to have a duel when you're a lawyer and I talk for a living?  Personally, what do you want me to do?  Just...  Because your fucking personality is what drives this whole thing you're doing.  Yeah, let's...  Guys, can I go to my next interview?  No, this is way better than any interview you're going to do today.  You're phony, dude.  Let's fight it out with words instead of guns.  Let's go to Peru for a duel.  How old are you?  You're a lawyer, aren't you? 
[03:00:00]  You're a lawyer.  You should be able to hang in there.  Hi, girls.  Can I buy you a hot toddy?  Let me call this guy and tell him that I'm going to be...  Oh, fuck that guy.  Come on, Roy.  Stop it.  Roy.  Good old Roy.  Roy, do you have a ponytail?  I think Roy has a ponytail.  No, no.  That was back in the hippie days.  Hi, girls.  How are you?  We want to be called women.  You dyke feminist.  Roy, it sounds like you have a tough time getting women.  Why?  One, two, three.  I said a hip hop, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie, a hippie.  Hoppy, you don't stop.  You're rocking to the bang, bang, boogie. 
[03:00:30]  Sit up.  I'm going to...  The fat boy.  No, stop two-stepping.  Roy's a nerd.  Roy is a nerd.  All right, class.  Today, we're going to dance to parents just don't understand.  Roy's a nerd.  Let's go to Peru and have a duel.  All right, then.  Oh, goodbye, Roy.  Fucking stupid lawyer.  Beat it.  Fucking asshole, Roy. 
[03:01:00]  There goes one of our fine guests.  You want to go to Peru and have a duel?  A duel.  I was on your side, stupid.  Oh, he got hot under the collar.  That was funny.  That was Jimmy Dore.  A duel.  He wanted to just kill you.  He wanted to shoot you and kill you.  Yes, a duel.  That's what I hate about a guy like this.  Like, you call him out on his horse shit, and I was on his side.  Yes, you were.  Until I listened to his phony fucking reasoning.  Completely driven by his own personal reasons.  Whatever they might be. 
[03:01:30]  His ex-wife, a mommy issue.  I don't know what they are, but it was completely driven by his personal agenda.  Yeah.  And so that's not justice.  Justice is supposed to be blind.  You weigh the facts, and you make a decision.  That's why there's that scale.  And she's blindfolded.  Very nice.  And this guy's bringing in his personal fucking agenda into his cause here, his crusade.  And if your personal experience is what's driving your cause, let's say, well, then your personal  experience can be talked about. 
[03:02:00]  And I mean, he mentioned his ex-wife.  He mentioned he goes to a hip-hop class.  Well, how old are you?  Which was hysterical.  Because this is what's annoying, because he says things like, you know, when I went to  a bar, and I walk up to a, and I go, hi, girls, and they critique the, okay, so you've  already brought your personal interaction into it.  Yeah.  So don't get mad at me when I call you out on the horse shit.  Right.  Of what you're saying.  Like, what do you mean you don't want professional women?  What women are you calling?  How stupid are you to go up and go, hi, girls?  That's not the way it works today.  Hey, girls.  But it's also his personality, because, I mean. 
[03:02:30]  He's a fucking bore.  Hey, toots.  Has anyone ever been corrected, and a woman goes, I'm a woman, not a girl?  I have never been corrected.  I've had it happen.  Yes.  Really?  I've heard it again.  But Jimmy's been corrected with, no, sweetie.  I'm not quite a girl.  Daddy.  Then they can kill the unborn.  You can just hear this fucking stupid agenda he's got.  This guy has so much annoyance at women.  It's an unhealthy amount.  We get it.  They're all terrible.  Men's rights are gone.  We get it.  Men are victims.  We get it. 
[03:03:00]  He's going after clubs and club owners.  He's trying to fuck young chicks who don't want to fuck them.  You don't take a hip-hop class, because he went to law school between 81 and 83.  So you do a little math.  What are you, 22 in law school?  He's about 50.  45 to 50?  Fine.  He's about 50.  If he said, I'm 45, I like to fuck young girls.  I mean, that's cool.  I got no problem with that, dude.  I'm 40.  I like to fuck young girls.  What happened?  What do you got?  What?  You want to continue with him?  Yeah, let's give Roy back.  I'll take Roy back.  I like Roy.  I'll be right back. 
[03:03:30]  I'm going to have my speaker play.  Oh, this Roy.  Now, he challenges you to a duel.  But that's exactly who he is.  What's the matter?  I'm not a fucking chick.  And in the middle of you yelling, I was like, please substitute Anthony in the duel.  Oh, yeah.  I did.  Oh, okay.  It's a duel.  I'll go down to Peru and duel him.  Fuck him.  What are you doing?  Your wife's beating the argument.  Fucking hit her in the throat.  That's stupid.  At the last second, Jimmy goes, I want a substitution, and gets Anthony off the bench.  They turn a blind eye in Peru.  Do they? 
[03:04:00]  What the hell is that all about?  They don't.  Of course they don't.  What is he talking about?  What are you talking about, Roy?  He's being silly.  Here comes Roy.  A lot of people on the phone.  I'm sure a lot of them agree with him, too.  Hey.  No.  I don't think so.  He's cock blocking himself.  Patrice should be here.  Jim made some powerful points calling him kiddo and cornball.  I will explain to Roy, without yelling and without being rude, why I was doing personal  attacks when he comes back on.  Why it went there for me.  Jimmy, I'm going to sneak in a sandwich, all right? 
[03:04:30]  Okay.  Roy?  Roy, you're on.  Okay.  Before we start arguing.  Let me just apologize for hanging up, but you see, I had made a commitment to another  interview at 10 o'clock.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I had to call on my mobile, but the guy was calling to change the date, so I found that  out until I'm getting back to you.  No problem, Roy.  This is why I started going after you on a personal level, and I'm not going after who  you are as a fucking human or your parents.  I'm going after what I think is driving, which to me, if something I interpret as kind 
[03:05:00]  of phony, and that doesn't smell right, is driving something, I'm going to criticize that.  And when you say something like, I walk into a bar, and I say, hey, girls, and they correct  me, and that makes you mad, and then you're like, why should I change the way I talk?  Because of feminism, it's almost like these are individual girls who want to be called  a certain thing, and if you're trying to fuck them, you have to play the game the same  as I do and the same as everybody else does.  It's almost like you're mad that they want to be called women? 
[03:05:30]  Well, here's your choice.  Either call them women in the bar, or don't complain when you can't fuck them, because  that's what I have to do.  It's what all guys have to do.  Okay, well, my response to that is what I thought I made that clear, but if I come across  a girl, and this has happened to me a couple times, where she's clearly a feminist, and I'm  not going to proceed trying to hustle her.  I'm just going to go.  Do you have to hustle a girl to get her into bed?  Well, I mean, what do you want to call it? 
[03:06:00]  Proceed with the conversation?  I mean, whatever terminology you want to use.  There's a big difference between hustle a girl and proceed with a conversation.  Okay, conversation, if that's what you want to call it.  Well, whatever you do, just say it.  In the old days, I used the term hustle, but no need to nitpick the...  Boy, talking about Mr. Semantics is getting mad at me for nitpicking the language.  Well, Jimmy, come on.  So let me finish this.  So what I do in that case is, then I go and find a girl who I believe or hope is not a 
[03:06:30]  feminist.  That's all.  That's my choice.  So a feminist...  The girl doesn't want anything to do with me.  That's fine.  But, you know...  You wouldn't fuck a feminist, dude?  You want to play their games?  You wouldn't fucking play their games?  I want to dump my loads on them, and I'm good at it.  Yeah, sometimes you got to play...  Whoa, excuse me.  Hold on.  You want to play their games?  Here's a guy who won't tell you his age because he doesn't want women to blow up his spot,  and you're accusing me of, do I want to play their games?  You're playing their games.  You're so...  You can't even just be yourself and go, hey, I'm 45, or whatever it is you are.  This is who I am. 
[03:07:00]  Fuck me or don't fuck me.  Like me or don't like me.  So you are playing games.  Well, that's an interesting point.  I remember a guy in Russia, who used to be one of the investigators, he'd just go up  to a girl and say, look, what do you want?  I'll give it to you.  I don't want to play around and do any games.  Okay, so we all do a little game playing.  All right, well, then don't be selective and self-righteous about it.  Some game playing, I'm not going to do, you know, that's all.  And you don't want to talk to a woman in a bar who's a feminist?  No, no, not a feminist.  No, I don't.  Okay.  They're not all feminists, that's for sure.  Of course they're not, but why can't you fuck a woman?  Like, would you fuck a woman who's a Republican or a Democrat? 
[03:07:30]  Like, who cares?  Yeah, of course.  I mean, even if she's Taliban.  Hey, Roy, I'm a little confused.  I'm in the middle of my sandwich, but...  Okay.  You're not going to find many feminists at ladies' nights.  Feminists don't go to ladies' nights.  Good point.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I'm going to go back to my sandwich.  That's actually a good point.  Yeah, I'm good for one every once in a while.  That's a damn good point.  All right.  Comment?  Oh, yeah.  My response is that I've run into them at ladies' nights, but of course that's anecdotal, and on a statistic basis, I don't know. 
[03:08:00]  But I would think that a lot of ladies who go to ladies' nights are what I would call budding young feminists.  Really?  Feminists.  You know what I think ladies' nights are?  But let me just finish.  I mean, the objection to ladies' nights was that guys are paying more to get into the bar than girls, so there's a transfer of wealth from guys to girls.  Yeah, but ladies' nights are specifically made to get girls in the bar so guys have more hunting, more game to hunt. 
[03:08:30]  That's pretty much what it is.  I think it's a good thing for the guys, and I don't think guys mind paying a little extra for a drink if there's going to be twice as many girls in the bars instead of a sausage factory when they go in because the girls like going down there because they know they could get some drinks on the cheap.  Yeah, but that's not my view and my experience is ladies' nights don't do that.  When I go to ladies' nights in a New York City nightclub, generally, there's more guys than girls. 
[03:09:00]  But if I go to bars that charge the same, it's, you know, it ebbs and changes throughout the night.  But if I go to bars that charge the same, it's usually, you know, around 60.  Okay, so basically, you'll embarrass yourself by, like, not talking about your age.  Like, you'll keep that a secret, which to me is, like, I'm 40 years old, and I like to fuck girls in their 20s if possible.  Sure.  There's a humiliating thing to me about not admitting your age.  But I'm not saying it's bad to be 40 or 50 or whatever it is.  But yet you'll take a hip-hop class because you want to be able to dance with these younger kids. 
[03:09:30]  It's almost like you want to just set the system up so you can fuck a lot of girls easier without having to weed through the women that don't want to fuck you.  Well, I don't know if that's possible.  Wouldn't that be ideal?  Well, dude, but that's not the way it is.  I mean, that sounds like an ideal system.  Yeah, but it doesn't drive me to fight legally.  I don't think it's going to happen in this country.  But you're saying I don't want to bang a feminist.  I fuck feminists.  That's my choice.  It is your choice, but to me, to take a feminist who is the same as any other woman in bed, they're all in the same bed, they like this, they like that, and to pull her hair and to fuck her mouth, that's really sexy because you're seeing somebody stripped of all that politically ideological nonsense and social nonsense and just being who they are in bed. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, but generally you have to talk to them beforehand.  Yeah, a lot of them are annoying and a lot of them are smart and have a certain political view, but it doesn't interfere with what they're doing when they're trying to get dick.  Yeah, that's true, but it's a choice I make because I don't want to talk with them.  I don't want to deal with their philosophy either before. 
[03:10:30]  I think because you feel threatened by them because they reject you because they make you feel old.  Hold on, hold on.  I think because they make you feel old because they criticize things like when you say girls or whatever and they don't like it and you don't seem to know how to deal with that.  Well, sure, when they say, use the term women, I say I don't try to censor your speech, but I try to censor mine.  Oh, you're a ball of laughs.  But I want to go back to the threatening, yeah.  I mean, I think feminists are threatening to the rights of guys.  I think they're threatening to this society. 
[03:11:00]  I mean, I've seen what has happened to this society in the last 40 years, and yes, I do believe they are a threat, and that's also one of a number of reasons for these lawsuits.  Hey, Roy, are we still dueling?  Where are we at with the duel?  Well, I don't know.  Jimmy hasn't called me too many names yet, so...  I'll call you a lot of names because I still think you're fucking phony.  But as far as dueling is concerned, don't be silly.  I don't like to engage in name-calling, but I'll...  Of course, unless it's feminist or baby killer.  I'll make an exception here, and I just think you're an ignorant fool. 
[03:11:30]  Yes, but I fuck a lot more girls than you do.  So you understand, I get what I want, and I'm honest.  Maybe yes, maybe no, maybe rain, maybe snow.  Oh!  What?  Maybe yes, maybe no.  Maybe yes, maybe no.  All right, we heard it.  Maybe rain, maybe snow, and you...  But yet you take...  That's why you're not getting laid, by the way.  Which hip-hop class did they teach you that in?  The Doolin's Challenge still stands in Peru.  Yeah, well, I...  You're more of a man than me.  I'm not going to fly to a fucking third-world country and shoot it out with a lawyer who can't get pussy.  You can't do it in America. 
[03:12:00]  Sorry.  While you're in Peru, I'll fuck a girl here.  Roy can't get pussy.  You're right, Roy.  You got me.  Jimmy, here, this is what we'll do.  Both of us, we'll go to a nightclub of your choice, and we'll see who ends up getting more phone numbers,  and then after the number of phone numbers, who ends up with more dates.  How about this?  Let's see who gets more...  How about this?  And here's the real deal.  How about, let's see who's got more fucking emails sent to them from women.  Let's give out your...  You want to give out your website? 
[03:12:30]  Is Roy...  My email address is on there.  Okay.  Then I'll give out your website.  Roy Den Hollander.  H-O-L-L-A-N-D-E-R.  Roy Den is R-O-Y-D-E-N-H-O-L-L-A-N-D-E-R.com, correct?  Right.  That's right.  So, any women that want to contact Roy, is there a picture of you on the site?  Yeah, there's...  Yeah, there is.  Okay, this looks like a personal get-to-know-your site.  They can go there, and they can see your picture, and maybe a lot of them will want to fuck you.  But I think that's...  To me...  What about your site?  You got to give out yours, too.  They all know it, sweetie. 
[03:13:00]  MySpace.com, Jim Norton.  They all know it.  Okay, I didn't know you were famous.  I know you don't, but that's the difference between you and I.  I kind of am aware of what you are, and you're not aware of what I am.  I'm honest about what I am on the air.  I'm glad I'm not aware of what you are.  Yeah, and I'm an honest guy.  I'm a 40-year-old guy who likes to fuck young chicks.  That's what I am.  Well, you're leaving a few things out, Jimmy.  Well, what 40-year-old guy doesn't?  I don't know, but 40-year-old guys that won't talk about how old they are.  I don't think they are any unless they're gay.  Well, unless they're afraid to talk about their age.  Dude, I just can't respect the guy that won't mention his age.  Well, that's fine, that's fine.  I want to bring up the gay thing with Roy. 
[03:13:30]  There's such a cowardly...  There's such a dishonesty in that.  There's such a fucking, I want to be something I'm not.  What's the matter?  Do you want to be younger?  You want to learn to dance like the young kids, Roy?  Why is it bugging you so much?  Because to me, it is the essence of your phoniness.  Then you think I'm a hypocrite.  Fine.  No, I know you are.  Hey, maybe rain, maybe snow.  Hi, girls!  I'm not going to go around trying to get your approval.  I don't give a damn.  Of course you give a damn. 
[03:14:00]  You challenged me to a duel in Peru.  Why should I go around trying to get your approval?  You, you...  You know what we're doing is talking about it.  Whose approval do you want to get?  You don't want mine.  You don't want feminists.  You just...  What, you want to fuck girls with Down syndrome?  I thought you didn't like feminists.  Do you like feminists?  I love fucking feminists.  Why don't you go to Scandinavia, change your sex, and come back and become a feminist?  Dude, I don't need to do that, because I know how to get that pants off.  Studies courses, you know?  Dude, I don't need that.  You can stand up with them and say, oh, guys...  A woman's studies course, how about a hip-hop class?  Go ahead.  I'll take a hip-hop dance class. 
[03:14:30]  A fucking hip-hop dance class is embarrassing.  Roy, you got to admit, that's kind of embarrassing.  You know, maybe like...  It's embarrassing.  Which you are, Jimmy.  It's...  Which you are.  I know, I'm Rob Raines, and I got it.  I thought you were a comedian.  Even a spinning class with women is cooler.  Yes, I am a comedian.  So what are you saying?  What are you saying?  Go ahead, Roy.  Your turn.  I'll say something funny.  If you're a comedian...  Okay.  Two Jews walk into a bar, and neither one of them will fuck Roy. 
[03:15:00]  See?  You talked over the punchline, stupid.  That's very funny.  You're probably as bad a lawyer as you are an audience member.  You talked over the punchline.  Naughty, naughty, Roy.  Roy.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I didn't give you a chance at your punchline.  Well, there you go.  Well, you asked me to tell a joke.  Why did the chicken cross the road?  Because it thought Roy might try to fuck it with hip-hop dance lingo.  I wanted to see this show go on.  Is this all you guys ever do?  Roy, I'm telling you jokes.  We asked for a joke.  Jimmy's giving you his best material, Roy. 
[03:15:30]  Okay, let me try this.  All right.  Hold on.  Here's a joke for you.  Knock, knock.  Roy.  No, you go.  You do it.  No, this is a participation joke.  Yeah, I need your help.  No, so once again, Jimmy.  Knock, knock.  Come on, Roy.  We're trying to get you on the same.  Hold on, Roy.  We're trying to get you on the same page again.  You wanted to say who's there?  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  No, no.  What a dope.  He didn't even know where to go with knock, knock.  All right.  Hold on.  Jimmy starts.  Hold on.  Jimmy starts.  Knock, knock.  Yeah, who's there? 
[03:16:00]  A lawyer who nobody wants to fuck.  Okay.  Come on.  That was pretty funny.  Hey, you challenged me as a kid.  Knock, knock, knock.  Oh, shit.  Okay, funny.  Okay, guys.  Who's there?  A comedian is not really funny.  But your friends aren't laughing.  Because you stole the joke, stupid.  You stole the joke.  You dumb asshole.  That wasn't a joke.  We're not laughing.  You stole the joke.  Because that wasn't funny.  They wouldn't laugh at me in a second.  Do you try these gems on the chicks? 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Hi, girls.  Here's a funny one I heard.  Jimmy, do you have another joke for Roy?  Can I ask somebody a question?  You sure can, Roy.  Let Roy ask.  What are you talking to now?  Anthony?  Anthony and...  And Jimmy and Opie.  Greg here is here.  Opie.  How long is this going to go on?  I don't think we're really getting any place.  Why'd you call back then?  You glutton for punishment?  Yeah.  Why'd you call back?  Is that the entertainment value of the show?  Well, Jimmy's got another joke for you, Roy.  I do believe.  I'm trying to think of a really...  No, we...  I mean, is that the entertainment value of the show?  Are we going to go into...  Oh, yeah.  No, we've discussed everything. 
[03:17:00]  We're kind of getting into another aspect of you.  And you're so angry.  Another aspect of you.  You're so angry right now.  By the way, I've got to be honest.  I was so against having you on our show today.  I even told Jimmy.  Yeah.  But I've got to tell Jimmy I was very wrong today.  Oh, yeah.  I wanted you on.  And I said no, and I lost this one.  And thank God I did.  Yeah, you were right.  And you can actually listen to the tape.  I wanted you on, because yesterday I mentioned you on the air.  I like the fact...  Look, look.  Hold on.  No, no.  Now you're interrupting.  I would agree.  I don't care what you think, Jimmy.  Ooh. 
[03:17:30]  You want to talk about something that's not your own personal opinions?  I don't care.  You're giving your personal opinions, but I can't give mine?  I like this.  Here, you'll like this.  I got an email here.  I don't like...  Why would I like that?  I got an email.  It says, you'll like this, Jimmy.  You are a fag.  Jimmy's right.  There you go.  Who's that from?  Your subconscious?  No.  Shut up and let my friends laugh at my joke.  That was kind of funny.  You have the timing of a fucking...  People laugh and you talk over it, you boring lawyer. 
[03:18:00]  Roy, hold on, Roy.  Jimmy's got another joke for you.  Okay.  Hold on, hold on, Roy.  Another joke.  Here's a joke.  We're going to prove Jimmy's funny.  What's wrong with Roy the lawyer with shit up to his neck?  What?  Not enough shit.  Thank you, Kenny.  That was courtesy of Clubs on the camera.  No, Roy.  Roy, Roy, I would like to ask you something.  I would like to sign off, but I thank you for having me.  Roy, could I ask you a question?  I'm asking you on my show and I... 
[03:18:30]  You know, and I...  Roy.  I got a good joke, Roy.  You want a joke?  How many lawyers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?  Ciao.  Oh, hold on.  Ciao?  Ciao.  Ciao?  Roy, you didn't learn that in hip-hop class.  I wanted to know what kind of hip-hop songs he dances to.  Let's get Roy back.  I want to get so into that hip-hop class because I picture it and it's such a douche chill.  You know that scene from Saturday Night Fever when Tony Manero goes in and, you know, Tony  can dance and he's going with the chick that can dance and the guy that owns the dance 
[03:19:00]  place is teaching the old people to do disco duck?  They go, disco, disco duck, and the old people are doing, like, the hustle?  That's what I picture this guy doing in a hip-hop class.  Like, old school fucking hip-hop dancing.  He brings a piece of cardboard and a boombox and tries to spin on his gray head.  Oh, he looks like fucking the father from Mork and Mindy.  Beat it.  Wow, very good.  Yeah.  What a fucking phony bastard.  I'm dancing the hip-hop. 
[03:19:30]  I'm going to dance a little of the hip-hop now.  Party rock!  Look at Poe going.  We're watching a video of Poe in Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Oh, that's perfect.  Spanking the bitch.  Ah, a little sexual assault never hurt there.  Can we take a break?  Yes.  Because we've got to, like, wrap up a little early today, because we really do have to  go over to Sirius XM Radio.  God, that was funny.  And have a big powwow.  Dude.  Guy was gold. 
[03:20:00]  You know what?  Roy was gold.  He fucking...  If he just wouldn't have been such a pussy with the racial issue, we would have got along  fine.  He is guilt-ridden...  Fuck, of course.  That's that heavy part of the white shit.  Yeah, yeah.  But that women thing...  It's the same thing with the fucking...  He's never seen some of these black studies courses where they bring in a fucking violent  kill-whitey professor or speaker that comes in and says that, and that's not harmful.  Leonard Jeffries still succeeds when Khaled Mohammed was speaking at Kane College. 
[03:20:30]  You know, it's just this fucking phony old white dude...  Hypocrite.  That's a guilt-ridden white person.  Let me tell you something.  And I was just watching something on CNN during that conversation, and apparently they are  putting a curfew in place in Hartford because of teen violence.  I don't think they're feminists.  It's amazing.  People are saying that Roy is 58 years old, by the way.  58?  No, I don't think he's... 
[03:21:00]  Chow.  Hey, chow.  Chow, baby.  Chow.  I threw him into our site that we used to look up background information, and he lists  two different dates of birth, but he's either 57 or 60.  Wow!  Okay.  Because law school, starting in 81, that means he did, what, four years before that in college?  But like Travis was saying, that's assuming that he went into law school right away.  I'm taking the hip-hop classes.  So he's 50 at the least, Jimmy.  So if he's 57 or 60, if he would have said, look, I'm 57, or whatever he is, and I like 
[03:21:30]  to fuck young...  I mean, I got no problem with a guy wanting to bang young chicks.  But to me, it's like, when that is what's driving you, and I listen to someone who can't  talk to certain women in a bar, I choose not to.  It's like, that's all it's about.  You're just an old cornball, and let's go have a duel.  Shut up, stupid.  I don't use violence.  I use my mouth to make a living.  Insert joke there, Roy.  You're a lawyer.  You ought to do the same.  Oh, we had a million Roy jokes right ago.  Oh, I know. 
[03:22:00]  We got it.  Yeah, don't ask me to tell jokes, and then get mad, and then steal it, and do it back.  Maybe that's your problem.  Why did the chicken cross the road again?  Because I thought Roy wanted to fuck it.  But then he comes back with the same joke as me.  He came back.  He used the fucking Marion's defense.  Just used the same joke.  And it's like, he needs a dumb girl in a bar.  I can't respect a guy who needs a dummy.  It's like a feminist annoys me a lot of times on an ideological level.  They are irritating and agenda-driven, and I agree with him on some of what he said. 
[03:22:30]  But it's like, God, to get one of them in bed?  Sure.  I've had a couple of them.  And when you fucking pull their little dirty hair, and you fucking spit in their mouth,  and you understand that fucking that we're all the same in bed.  All that shit goes out the window.  Right.  It's fucking dirty, and it's sexy.  Their little power slacks come off.  Yeah, you give them a good spanking.  And there's a pussy under there.  Squeeze that little fat pussy.  Hey, can I do a spoiler alert before the break?  Okay.  Spoiler alert.  What?  So you can turn the channel or plug your ears. 
[03:23:00]  For what?  Well, it's Olympic stuff.  Okay.  Spoiler alert.  What?  Did I give people enough time to change?  Yeah, plenty.  More than plenty.  Okay.  Usain Bolt.  Hussein?  Usain.  Usain?  Usain?  Usain Bolt.  Ted Bolt.  He's the Jamaican runner that set the world record.  Ted, man.  I like to run very fast.  Sometimes we run so fast, we drop a coconut. 
[03:23:30]  A coconut.  We like to smoke pot.  Oh, shit.  We come from Houston.  We run so fast.  Ted, the Jamaican, huh?  I'm Ted Bolt.  Ted Bolt.  Me name Ted Bolt.  Ah, fuck it.  Just watch NBC tonight.  No, I want to know.  What about it?  That's funny.  Well, he set the world record in the 100 meter with his shoe untied, and he was celebrating.  Remember that guy?  With the 9.69. 
[03:24:00]  They're saying, holy crap, if he took it seriously, he might have broken 9.60, which would be insane.  Insane.  He just set the world record for the 200 meter as well.  He did.  And that'll be on NBC tonight.  That.  Wow.  Me used to run to school when me forgot me lunchbox.  Hard to do Ted and not sound Irish.  Me like to dance hip-hop.  Hip-hop classes. 
[03:24:30]  I would love to see that fool in there with girls that he says are in their 20s learning hip-hop, and he's trying to do it.  Yeah.  Oh, would that be funny.  Let's go to Corinne.  Corinne, sorry.  Corinne in Jersey.  She's a regular.  What's up, Corinne?  Hey, guys.  I just had to say, Roy is totally the guy in Boogie Nights who, every time he walks into the room, his wife is fucking some other guy.  Oh, God.  William H. Macy's character.  Oh, yeah.  She's got an ass in her cock.  She's got an ass in her cock. 
[03:25:00]  Fucking lawyer.  Yuck.  Is there anyone else that plays pathetic better than Macy?  William H. Macy.  He's fantastic.  Every movie, he's a pathetic guy.  I like it.  In Fargo.  The end of Fargo is the best when the cops are knocking at the door.  Oh, yeah.  Be right there.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Come and be right at the door.  And they bust the door in, and he's trying to get out the window, and they're pinning him on the bed, and he's going,  Ah!  Ah!  No!  Okay.  God, that was a great, what a great falling apart and unraveling that role was. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  This fucking guy was amazing.  That's brilliant.  It gets worse and worse, and he's just like, okay.  All right.  What the fuck was that other, he was in the cooler, right?  Yeah.  He was the main guy in the cooler, and what happened with the chick he was seeing in that one again?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot, but it was something horrific.  Did somebody help me out?  Oh, I think, what's his name?  He comes in and, like, fucking beats the shit out of her.  Alec Baldwin?  Alec Baldwin.  And he can't do anything about it?  No, of course not.  He can't be a man and, like, you know, defend his woman.  What was it? 
[03:26:00]  Oh, oh, E-Rock?  I think it was his son's girlfriend or something.  She was faking a pregnancy.  Yeah.  And then Alec Baldwin caught on to it and just punched her right in the stomach.  Punched her in the stomach because it was a padding.  And they ripped her clothes off and found that she was...  Faking the pregnancy, and he had no idea or something like that?  Yeah, he had no idea.  Oh, he plays pathetic better than...  Who else plays pathetic?  No, it's fantastic.  He's fucking Eric Nagel.  He just threw his hands up.  He's like, I'm...  Ah, I love it.  He's like, I'm going to be useful. 
[03:26:30]  You know, this should help me.  And now...  I know it was going through his head, too.  Because he heard you say that when the door was probably six inches from being closed  and he would have had one successful appearance without any abuse.  He almost had.  And he was probably thinking, wow, that went well.  No, it didn't.  That's right.  People are so happy with their emails.  They're sending Roy that they're sending copies to us.  Nice.  Uh, retard sex from Boston.  My email to Roy.  Title, hip-hop class is great.  Electric slide into another man's ass. 
[03:27:00]  Love retard sex.  Electric sex.  Let's ask Roy if he's getting a lot of email.  Mmm.  I bet he is.  He's the veterinarian from the getaway where Michael Madsen is fucking...  That's right!  Yeah.  Holy shit, he was the fucking, uh, the cuckold in that.  Cuckold.  Was that Macy?  No.  I think he was...  No, no.  Was it?  Was that him? 
[03:27:30]  I don't think so.  He's the veterinarian from the getaway where Michael Madsen is fucking his wife while he's  tied up in the bathroom.  I thought the guy was younger.  Oh, okay.  That's Fast Freddy.  And then he ends up, what, hanging himself because he couldn't take it anymore or something  like that?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Be right there.  Okay.  It's all happy and chipper.  I love when all hell's breaking loose and his kid's like, Dad, everything all right?  Or something like that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fine.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, and yeah, because his father-in-law is dead in the trunk at that point of his car. 
[03:28:00]  His wife is dead.  Fucking...  He doesn't have the ransom money.  He's just a...  He was a regular guy and all...  Yeah, yeah.  Everything is wrong now.  All right, Scotty.  No...  No, I think I'm going to go to bed.  God, what a great...  That was so good, the unraveling he went through.  Yeah, dude.  Someone just found Roy's MySpace page.  Jeff M. from Staten Island.  All his friends are hot chicks.  He doesn't stand a chance at hell.  Fucking...  And then Stephen asks, of course, from Bayshore, I love Macy's facial expression in Fargo when 
[03:28:30]  the customer is yelling at him about getting ripped off because he's getting charged for  the clear...  For the true coat.  The true coat.  Well, that true coat, I got to tell you.  Well, I'll talk to my supervisor.  I'll talk to my boss.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  In the cooler...  E-Rock pretty much said it.  John Regan from Bayonne.  In the cooler, Macy's son tries to con him by pretending his girlfriend is preggers.  Right.  Hold on.  But Alex Baldwin's character sees right through it, punches her in the stomach, and then breaks  the son's ankles. 
[03:29:00]  That's right.  All right.  What is the MySpace page?  Did we find it?  I had it up before.  Oh, I didn't see it.  I had a tinkle.  Oh.  Can we see it?  A little tinkle.  Well, we're going to go...  We're going to seg into line of the day and get out of here a little early.  Yes.  We've got to be at Sirius XM at 11 o'clock.  Yeah.  So let's get the...  Hurry up, Jimmy.  Get the fling out of here.  Oh.  Let's look at his friends.  Let's make like a tree and get out of here. 
[03:29:30]  Jimmy, what's his friends?  Because we can do line of the day while you leave.  He's not a bad looking...  Let me see his pictures.  Oh, Jesus.  He's got a MySpace page?  He put a hundred years old.  I love that.  It's probably accurate.  Is that his MySpace page?  Yeah.  Wow.  I got to log in.  Hang on.  Let's find it.  Nice.  Nice find.  Good find.  Yeah.  I'm going to see what his friends are.  Oh, that was Travis?  All right.  Then it's a sucky find.  Yes.  Then it's a gay find.  Of course it is. 
[03:30:00]  With a dumb dog.  Probably one of Travis's top friends.  A fake wife to make like he's heterosexual.  This is sad.  When you know you've done five hours of your best work and then you get someone like Anthony  from Mandeville writing.  Not sure if you all talked about her yet, but Google Lauren Franco.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Larine.  Larine.  Here's some of his picks.  We've been Google bombing her all day.  L-E-R-Y-N Franco for one of the hottest chicks ever.  Oh, my God. 
[03:30:30]  Is that a picture of him as a hippie?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Mark Maron.  Let's see.  Wow.  That is a...  It doesn't get any bigger than that there?  The web is being very slow today.  Let me see what it is.  Ah.  Intra tubes.  Wow.  He looks like one of the Allman brothers.  He looks kind of like a Dwayne Allman.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Love Dwayne Allman.  Wow.  Okay.  That's an old fucking picture.  You're right.  He's got to be pushing 60.  Go to the bottom if you can.  There he is.  That's a headshot smile. 
[03:31:00]  Who are his friends?  Like, does he have...  I want to see who his friends are.  They're all like prostitutes and fucking strippers.  Let me see what his favorite movies are.  Hold on.  Oh, favorite movies.  Let's see.  Television.  Educational programs and documentaries can teach, illuminate, and yes, even inspire.  That's not my quote.  Guess whose?  Um, I don't know.  Let me take a guess.  Another boar.  Um, books.  Read too many.  Ah, there you go.  Heroes. 
[03:31:30]  Uh, Frank Gifford.  Muhammad Ali.  Muhammad Ali.  And any man that's with an M who fights for what he believes despite the odds.  What did Frank Gifford fight for?  Ass sex with some fucking rat in a hotel room?  Oh, no.  Please.  His general interest.  Justice.  And the American way.  Yeah, okay, Superman.  Yeah.  Music.  Hip-hop.  Thanks to my instructor at Broadway Dance Center and Salsa. 
[03:32:00]  Thanks to the cute little Asian girl who asked me to dance at the Copacabana.  But I had to say no because I couldn't dance salsa at that time, not to imply that I can now.  Oh, there's a joke that a comedian's used.  I know it's a long sentence, but what do you expect from a lawyer?  This guy's an older Master Poe.  He's a tool.  Exactly.  He takes hip-hop at Broadway Dance Center and Salsa.  Oh.  And the little Asian girl who asked me to dance, but I had to say no because I was a soldier 
[03:32:30]  and she was running away with napalm on her.  Dude, Tim H. from Columbus Haddon, man.  Instead of a duel, Roy and Jimmy should have a hip-hop dance-off at Ladies' Night.  Oh, there you go.  We can go to the club of my choice.  Oh, I should fucking take it.  What's that tranny club on First Avenue?  Tranny club.  Oh, God.  Let's see who gets recognized first, Roy.  Jimmy was hoping that me and you would fight for the answer there, Anthony.  We'd both be screaming out the answer to that question. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, I know.  What's the name of that tranny joint?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, Jim, let me chance.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Lucky chance.  Thank you.  Why did I know that?  Who's, uh, all right, there's a couple of broads.  That must be a, all right, I'm looking at some broads.  These are, that must be one of his hip-hop chicks.  Why is it a black dude with a young Superman shirt on?  You know what?  That's Smash, yo.  And then the other guy is named Champagne or something.  Look at the black chicks.  You know, like all young black guy friends and hot white chicks. 
[03:33:30]  Well, they might be the hip-hop instructors.  And Hispanic and black chicks also, though.  I'm sure they are.  What a fucking, what a phony with the racial stuff.  This guy is a phony with the race thing.  What a phony, phony with the racial stuff.  There is no such thing as race.  Oh, stop it.  And then you get mad at me for playing with semantics.  Do you know, do you know, uh, Earl, one of his friends, Earl, a.k.a. Uncle Champagne,  laughs at you, motherfucker.  He fucking laughs at you, Roy.  You guys are missing the best part of his MySpace page.  What's that?  He has 82 friends. 
[03:34:00]  82 friends.  He has 82 friends.  Well, something tells me he's going to get a few more friend requests tonight.  Oh, can we see some of the comments people have left?  Hello, friend.  Well, uh, I want to see where his URL is so we can give it out for the...  I would love to see some of the...  Dude, the girls on his, uh, top 19 there or whatever are so fuckable.  Wait, let's see, let's see, uh...  That was club's fun little spot.  Okay, let's look at the girls.  Esau left him a message.  Thanks for the request, XOXO.  Miss Esau, L.A.'s number one station, 1027. 
[03:34:30]  So it's a fucking spam.  So he gets a spam.  A spam from a hot chick.  Spam from a hot chick, and he made him, her, his friend.  Because he requested a song.  Oh, let's see.  Uh, Roger put Natureverse...  Oh, my God.  Wait, but hang on.  The time span between those comments...  Yeah.  Uh, let's see.  Uh, January 5th.  January 5th was the last comment left, and then we get down to Roger, and that was February  4th, 2007.  Jesus Christ.  Roger left two in a row. 
[03:35:00]  Roger's obsessed with him.  Fucking get a hold of yourself, Roger.  Wow, Roger, enough.  Roger's obsessed.  Well, because I think Roger could read between the lines, if you know what I mean.  Oh, my God.  Roger thinks he has a shot.  Roger has left a lot of these fucking...  Roger keeps leaving these bad fucking...  Well, the Mona Lisa one is...  Spam things.  A before and after with the Mona Lisa.  Roger's a real fucking creep.  Holy shit.  And the after is...  There's another Roger.  The Mona Lisa a month left to be in the U.S.  Oh, there's a funny one.  Go down.  This Roger's a real cutoff.  August 22nd of 06. 
[03:35:30]  He can't get enough Roy.  No.  He wrote, Hi, Roy.  I'm glad...  What did he say?  I'm glad to have you a friend.  Now, don't get into too much trouble here on MySpace, okay?  LOL.  And then he put SKOL, Roger, Skol.  Don't get into too much trouble on MySpace.  LOL.  Dude.  What is that funny?  Unless it's not Gary Glenn's page.  He joined MySpace about two years ago, almost to the day. 
[03:36:00]  August 13th, 2006.  His buddy, Mark Andrew Moore, welcomes him to MySpace.  And that comment is still up on the first page.  On the first page.  He's a remarkably unpopular man.  Yes.  There's no next.  Who does he give out his MySpace address?  There's no next.  Yeah, as far as comments, there's no next.  All right, we gotta go.  Who does he give his fucking MySpace address to?  He probably just hands it out to mole people.  Yeah.  They have no computers.  We're obsessed with Roy.  Roy. 
[03:36:30]  Can we do a line of the day?  We gotta get out of here.  Yeah, let's do that.  One of his favorite movies is also Milk Money.  I don't know if you had mentioned that.  Ugh.  Casablanca.  Where is he?  It's back to the future, you fag.  Go line of the day, because we gotta go.  We were supposed to be out of here already.  We can't be late for this shindig.  All right.  Line of the day is brought to you, I believe, by Carbonite still.  Carbonite.  My health doesn't allow it.  Carbonite.com backs up your computer hard drive, so you never have to worry about losing  any of your files.  Check it out at Carbonite.com, promo code XM.  Here is a runner-up line of the D.  He believes it's going to be Hillary in a surprise, and we should hear any time tomorrow 
[03:37:00]  or Friday, because there's a stump event scheduled Saturday.  Oh, great.  So now Heather Mills is involved.  I was right on there, too, behind you.  Of course.  I was like, oh, okay.  I knew I had to fucking get to that one quickly.  Kenny, bring scissors, please.  What's the next one?  Let's do it, yeah.  Next runner-up line of the day.  Yeah.  Where are you? 
[03:37:30]  Boo.  Boo.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Bye, Steve.  The studio door is swinging back the other way.  Bye, Steve.  You said it.  That's stuck in my head all day.  What?  Just so you know, I do that obnoxious laugh.  Pendula.  On purpose.  But Pendula, I'm swinging back the other way.  What are you?  He's cutting my tag.  We should tell Roy that's the hot new song.  Yeah. 
[03:38:00]  Hot new hip-hop song.  Jimmy, you can't go over to SiriusXM with that mustache.  Of course I can.  Hi, gang.  Must get out of my way.  Here's another runner-up line of the D.  Retard sex from Boston.  My email to Roy.  Title, hip-hop class is great.  Electric slide into another man's ass.  I love it.  That is so funny.  That was hilarious.  The only radio show in America that acknowledged that their listeners are funny. 
[03:38:30]  Fucking funny bastards.  How many more we got?  Two more.  Two?  Okay.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Jesus.  All right.  Let's go to Paul then.  Paul, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got?  Huh?  Morning, boys.  There's no juice walking, y'all.  Just a point for you guys.  Sorry.  They heard it originally.  Fuck it.  And finally, the last runner-up.  What is the wording of it that you want changed? 
[03:39:00]  Oh, I want them.  I want.  There are certain provisions which provide for what I just told you about.  Everywhere it says woman, put in cunt.  That was hilarious.  That was hilarious.  No, no delay.  Let's go.  Because we've got to go.  Oh, my God.  We were supposed to be there already.  We're looking around.  We can't keep hoo-hoo waiting.  Here is your line of the day. 
[03:39:30]  Here comes...  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Day, day, day, day.  Knock, knock.  Yeah, who's there?  A lawyer who nobody wants to fuck with.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  Oh, that's great. 
[03:40:00]  A little short today, but we had fun.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Later.  It's like punch sound, woman's scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
