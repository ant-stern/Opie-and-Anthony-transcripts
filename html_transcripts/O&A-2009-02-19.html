<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated discussion about a New York Post cartoon depicting a bullet-ridden monkey, interpreted by many as a racist caricature of President Obama.  This sparked a broader conversation about perceived racial cowardice in America, focusing on whether the fear stems from potential backlash from black activist groups like those led by Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, or from white corporate entities avoiding controversy by firing employees.  The hosts, using numerous racial slurs and offensive jokes throughout the segment,  argued that while black leadership employs “mob-like tactics,” the root problem is the cowardice of white corporations succumbing to pressure instead of engaging in open dialogue. A black police officer caller offered a contrasting perspective, describing his open racial conversations with his white partner.  The segment included a comedic song satirizing Al Sharpton and explored the complexities of racial humor, “white guilt,” and the difficulties of honest racial discourse.

The discussion continued with callers debating the meaning of "no justice, no peace," the appropriateness of using racial slurs, and generational differences in sensitivity. A black caller, Ray, recounted assaulting someone who used a racial slur against him.  The debate about the Obama cartoon and Al Sharpton’s influence and legitimacy within the black community persisted, with callers questioning whether he profits from racial tension.  The conversation briefly shifted to a Fox 5 weather girl’s appearance before Patrice O'Neal joined the show. O'Neal offered commentary on the racial dynamics, comparing Al Sharpton's influence to Anthony's impact on white perspectives, suggesting both filled a void in articulating complex racial feelings.  A teacher caller then described her students’ discomfort with racial slurs in a historical book, leading to a discussion about the use of such language in films like *Gran Torino*.  Comedian Adam Ferrara joined the show before the broadcast abruptly transitioned to a news story about a woman severely mauled by her pet chimpanzee.

The chimpanzee attack dominated a significant portion of the show. The hosts provided graphic descriptions of the injuries, speculated on the chimp's motives (possibly jealousy), and the woman’s responsibility. They played audio clips of the owner's interviews and discussed the possibility of the woman giving the chimp Xanax.  Adam Ferrara again promoted his Gotham Comedy Club show, and the hosts discussed their restaurant building plans before returning to gruesome details of the attack. Jim Jefferies called in from Cleveland, discussing the radio industry, blaming Obama for economic issues, and criticizing sports team names like the Cleveland Indians.  He also promoted his HBO special, and the hosts and Jefferies brainstormed outrageous comedy club names.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the chimpanzee attack and related news stories, using offensive language and graphic descriptions.

A subsequent segment featured another call with Jim Jefferies, promoting his HBO special and discussing the free ticket process, with suggestions for outrageous special names like "Jim Norton Has a Giant Cock Tour".  Following this, Adam Ferrara and Doug Benson joined the show in studio. The conversation centered on marijuana, Benson's film "Super High Me," and the challenges of navigating gun laws in New York.  The discussion included crude jokes and anecdotes about comedy shows and hecklers, particularly drunk women at bachelorette parties.  Benson detailed his film's methodology and the challenges of network censorship.

The show concluded with a discussion about which Ridley Scott film to watch on a large screen, settling on *Gladiator*.  The conversation shifted to Doug Benson's social media presence and fake accounts, followed by a critique of *Twister*,  and other bad movies and actors, with *Boogie Nights* being an exception. A lengthy, sexually explicit discussion of Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance in *Doubt* followed.  The unexpected arrival of Sam's dad, with his handlebar mustache, provided a bizarre turn, revealing his unusual tastes and a family history surprisingly connected to Thomas Jefferson, with casual discussion of the family's ties to slavery.  The show ended with promotions for Doug Benson's projects.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  Radio shop, Josh.  O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  The article says,  U.S. Holder,  U.S. a nation of cowards on racial matters.  I'm reading this article.  That was a big story last night.  Now, I don't know if I,  what his views are,  what his racial discussion,  because I kind of get tired of hearing about,  well,  I have to have open racial dialogue, 
[00:00:30]  which means usually that white people  have to be more groveling and apologetic.  Yes.  But I will say this.  White people have been complete social cowards  when honestly discussing race.  Black people, I'm not saying they're always right.  No.  But they do admit their annoyances.  Well.  Openly, we don't accept each other.  Let me explain why.  That guy, it's very good.  I read that, too.  He's saying America is a nation of cowards  when it comes to discussing race. 
[00:01:00]  The black leadership, as it were,  and I mean that, use the term loosely,  because I'm talking about people like Sharpton  and the like, the ilk.  They have made it impossible  for white people to openly discuss race,  because the second you do it,  there is life-altering changes,  like losing one's job,  being shunned from society,  things like that.  This guy is great. 
[00:01:30]  He's saying,  oh, we're a nation of cowards.  Well, thanks for putting us in that position,  jackass.  We are.  Black people,  as far as,  especially, like I said,  this leadership,  this pseudo-leadership that they had,  especially before pre-Obama,  what we're talking.  It's impossible for white people  to speak openly about race,  because you're dubbed a racist  the second they hear something they don't want,  or like,  and then you're thrown out of your goddamn job.  So we're cowards for shutting our mouths, 
[00:02:00]  and keeping our livelihoods?  I'll tell you why.  It's not that you and I are cowards.  It's the people who are firing people.  They're not black people.  They're corporate white people.  So it's not like black people  are just firing white people.  And if Sharpton complains  with Jesse Jackson,  we all know that the boycotts are crap,  because the issues are not boycottable.  So everyone knows that Sharpton,  all you've got to do is say,  no one's going to buckle to you, 
[00:02:30]  just shut your mouth,  and it goes away without real consequence.  So he's not the problem.  The problem is that the people  who are firing the people for speaking out,  or whatever,  are cowardly white people.  I agree with that,  because I've said that in the past.  It's not black people's fault on this one.  But no,  it absolutely is,  because you're,  in essence,  blaming the victim.  Because a Sharpton comes up  and threatens a corporation  with a boycott,  regardless if it'll work or not. 
[00:03:00]  I know they don't work.  I know if people just told Al Sharpton  to go crapping his hat  and left it alone  and just let time go by,  whatever controversy there was  would go away.  It absolutely would,  and I understand that.  But you can't downplay  his effort  to get this company  to fire people  because they're also afraid.  There's a climate of fear,  there has been for years now, 
[00:03:30]  that you can't speak race  or racially  with black people  or you are dubbed a racist.  How about Asian groups?  How about all special interest groups?  How about gay, lesbian,  anti-deaf,  whatever they're called,  or the JDL,  any special interest group.  And again,  the majority of corporate people,  let's be very honest,  the majority of them  are white guys.  They are the ones  who fire people  whenever the special interest groups  pipe up.  Black ones are very vocal,  but it's not always black ones.  A lot of times  it's Asian ones 
[00:04:00]  or it's other ones.  The common denominator in that  is that it's normally,  not always,  a white guy getting fired  by a white boss  because of the complaints  of whatever special interest group  comes complaining.  The victim,  there really is no victim  other than the guy getting fired,  but the real culprit  is the coward  who is firing him.  Unless it's been like  a real offense  where a guy drops  an N-bomb on the air,  you know,  guys,  there's something  I can't take  the black leadership 
[00:04:30]  as I have to call them  or whatever  out of the equation.  I can't take them  out of the equation  and just blame it  on cowardly white bosses  and cowardly white people  that don't speak up.  I can't.  They have put a climate on it.  You've got to be smart.  You've got to know  when and what to say.  Like in any situation,  you're not going to walk  into a room full of Asians  and start making  Asian stereotype jokes 
[00:05:00]  and things like that.  A room of black people  and start doing that.  You can't do that.  But if you're honestly  and openly  having a discussion  about race  that includes facts,  figures,  and then you're  crucified for it,  it's intolerant  black people's fault  that we are  what this gentleman  has called cowards  when it comes to race.  I'd love to see  a population 
[00:05:30]  in this country  that isn't cowardly  when it comes to  speaking race.  We've been beaten down  so much  and I sound  hysterically hypocritical  when I say  the white man  has been beaten down  by the black man.  But in this day and age,  in a different way,  I'm not talking about  slavery days,  I'm talking about  this day and age,  it's very difficult  for a white person  to voice his opinions  on race,  especially with black groups,  and not be called  a racist.  But most white people, 
[00:06:00]  if you're expressing  something to black people,  very rarely do they react.  Usually,  the people who don't like  because they know,  a lot of black people know  if you're saying something  that's truthful  about race,  a lot of times  that the people  who are afraid  of that truth  they've uncovered  are the guilty whites,  are the white people  who feel like  they've done something wrong.  That's the problem.  I'm telling you,  when it comes to this racial,  I'm not saying black people  aren't at fault  for being hypersensitive.  And Patrice has a good word.  Patrice said unreasonable.  Sometimes lately,  yeah, you know what,  black people,  you've been unreasonable  the way you've targeted 
[00:06:30]  certain things.  But the bottom line  is it's guilty white people.  It's elitist white people.  Those are the ones.  Look, look, you can't,  I'll say this.  White people have screwed up race  in this country.  It's a reality.  And this is a self-flagellation  by white people screw up race  in this country.  Of course,  you look back through history,  there was a lot of stuff going on.  And believe it or not,  slavery was legal.  Yes.  Sorry.  What are you going to do about it? 
[00:07:00]  It was.  After slavery,  black people had a long road ahead of them  of a lot of racism.  And, you know,  they went through that.  But now we're at a point  where there is a black president.  He's appointing black leadership.  We're seeing black leaders  in positions that they'd never been in before.  They're being accepted  by, you know,  at least 50% of the country  as far as the votes go.  And it's not really this huge, 
[00:07:30]  amazing, big thing.  They're doing it.  It's working.  It's called assimilating  to our society,  which is what other people  and cultures have done  when they want to be successful  in this country.  But try talking about it.  And I don't mean one-on-one.  A lot of times  you can get one-on-one  with a black person  or a group of black people  and you're just talking.  And fine,  you can hash things out.  When you're in the public eye  and you say something about race, 
[00:08:00]  perish the thought.  You're on eggshells  that you say something.  And you absolutely shouldn't be.  But that's where the cowardice comes from.  Who fires?  Who's going to fire us  if we screw up?  And I don't just mean  open-ant and myself.  Who's going to fire  most people out there  listening to this show  if you F up?  You know what?  It's ignorance on the part  of management,  white management.  Cowardice.  You know, it's ignorance.  It's cowardice,  but there's ignorance in there.  They don't know  that nothing's going to happen.  They want controversy 
[00:08:30]  to go away very quickly.  And you're blaming a guy  with a gun to his head  for fire.  Here, I'm going to pull  the trigger on you  if you don't fire this guy.  Of course he's firing the guy.  But it's a gun  that everybody knows  when the trigger is pulled,  nothing comes out  but a sign that says,  pow.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a real gun.  And enough time  things have happened  where we know  it's not a real gun.  And the fact that  the examples we raise  are guys like Sharpton  and Jesse Jackson  who are proven asses. 
[00:09:00]  And then you get a guy like you.  But they got credibility.  You don't want to.  Look at today.  Look at today.  You don't want to be  on the receiving end  of stupid Al Sharpton  bitching about  the New York Post.  He's going to be  on the news  all day long now.  Who puts him on the news?  You don't want to be  the white Jewish media.  Exactly.  White people.  White people.  You know something?  Because he's an attraction.  He's something  people want to see.  He's something people  especially white people  want to laugh at 
[00:09:30]  as a clown.  The clown that he is.  And he's got  this credibility though.  No credibility.  That people are  Oh he doesn't?  No man.  Who did  Carolyn Kennedy  meet with  first thing  right out of the gate?  Exactly.  What about our new senator?  She met with him  right out of the gate.  Hillary Clinton  meets with him.  Barack Obama  meets with him.  That's credibility.  A bunch of dumb liberals.  Rudy wouldn't.  You know what I mean?  No.  Of course. 
[00:10:00]  But look who's in charge now.  Dumb liberals.  He does have  a power base.  He scares people.  He scares people.  But that's not credibility.  He doesn't have  credibility is different  than scaring people.  That isn't cowardice  being scared of the bully.  Sure.  But he's got nothing.  So why don't white people  like the bully  on the schoolyard  get together  and take him down?  And I don't mean  violently  I'm not advocating harm  but just like  expose him 
[00:10:30]  for the idiot that he is.  I like that this guy  from the New York Post  is coming out  and saying  that Sharpton  is once again  being an opportunistic douche.  Right.  He didn't quite use those words.  Those are my words.  And using this  as an opportunity  to once again  get his face in the news  because it's been out of the news  since Obama's been president.  So it's another opportunity  for him to do that.  They kind of explained  the comic  that is in question.  The dead monkey  laying there  with the two cops  with their guns smoking. 
[00:11:00]  The monkey's  riddled with bullets  and they're saying  now who are they going  to get to write  a new stimulus bill.  Do you agree  with the explanation?  It's viable.  That's a rough one.  I don't agree with it.  I'm not a big fan  of Sharpton  but the guy  of course he was going  to go after Sharpton.  What else is he going to do?  What else is he going to do?  We knew what the cartoon  was saying.  This cartoon is brutal.  Pointing it out.  It's more racist.  You should be able  to draw whatever  effing cartoon you want 
[00:11:30]  but it's brutal.  Pointing it out  is more racist  than drawing it.  At least you have  an inkling of an excuse.  You have different options.  You can say  I meant this.  I meant that.  Pointing it out  as Al Sharpton has  is racist  because you then  are saying  yes, you're equating  a black man  with a monkey.  You're saying that  and the realism is  perhaps  one in a million shot.  Perhaps he wasn't  the guy that wrote it.  It's almost like  it's a stupid one  the Supreme Court 
[00:12:00]  said about pornography.  I can't define it  but I know it  when I see it.  We all  our common experiences  we know what this guy  was saying.  And again  I don't think  he should be fired for it.  It's tasteless.  I think it is  a tasteless cartoon  but when you do  something that  obvious  there is no other  explanation  that any rational  person buys.  We know what he was saying  and being honest about it  it's not racist.  He was saying  Obama was a monkey.  That's what he's saying.  And it's like  he wanted you  to convey that message. 
[00:12:30]  A funny example  of race  of like something  being racist  that probably wasn't meant  is like the South Park  episode  which was brilliant  about the N word  where it's N blank  G-G-E-R-S  people who annoy us  and the guy  gives the wrong answer  and the correct answer  was naggers.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like that is  a brilliant example  where the explanation  is real  like no  I didn't mean that  I meant this.  but this  is almost like  if they say anything  other than  yeah this is what  I meant to say  he's trying to be cute 
[00:13:00]  he's trying to give you  that message  and then be cute  with his explanation  that's insulting  his explanation was  no matter who wrote  the stimulus package  it sucked  and could have been  written by a monkey  monkeys over the years  have been used  as examples  of things  that have been done  that are stupid  ignorant  monkey business  things like that  just because  the president  is now  a black president  you can't 
[00:13:30]  equate  anything he does  with a monkey  even in a way  that doesn't  it's not supposed  to be racist  it's just supposed  to be  this is stupid  this is ignorant  it tied it into  a very topical  recent news event  and you can't do that  I was listening  to Ronnie B  yesterday  and you look up  George Bush monkey  and you'll see  20 instances  where his face  is morphed  into a chimp  I understand  why then  because our 
[00:14:00]  president's black  you can't use  the analogy  of a monkey  not in a  physical sense  or look at this  you know  the traditional  racist sense  but since we're  so moving forward  and progressive  these days  why can't we  use that  as an example  of how ignorant  things are  how stupid  how a monkey  like a monkey  sitting at a typewriter  might pound this out  because  for him to defend  himself that way  is dishonest  it's like  don't give me 
[00:14:30]  that  like don't say  two Jews  walk into a bar  they own it  and then when I go  oh wow  that's the joke  about the Jewish  Jewish stereotype  about Jews being  money  or whatever you want  to say  and then deny  at least  you know what I mean  if you're going to  make the joke  and make the cartoon  fair enough  but that is what it is  so you thought  you think  at this moment  right now  that that guy  that wrote that comic  put a monkey in there  as a physical representation  of the president  because 
[00:15:00]  of past racial stereotypes  no  I think he did it  knowing exactly  what it would elicit  but having  that one percent  thin way  of backing out of it  by going  hey  technically  then isn't that brilliant  and what we do  on a daily basis  on this show  no  because  he's trying  to give that  you understand  what I'm saying  he's trying  to say that  at least admit  what you were trying  we never deny  what we were trying  to say  we don't deny  that we're trying  to be funny  about something  yeah  like yeah  we do racial jokes 
[00:15:30]  we do rape jokes  we do terrible jokes  we don't deny  that we're making  fun of something  like even that plane crash  when the guy  got mad the other day  yeah we use dark humor  on this show  we were taking  something awful  we weren't going  no sir  we were being  totally serious  we weren't completely  thinly backing out  of it  you're right  but let's tear away  a wall here  and be completely honest  what subject  on this program  are we the most  sensitive about  tiptoeing around  race  I would definitely  say  absolutely  we're petrified 
[00:16:00]  yes  that someone's  going to say  something stupid  and get us  thrown off the air  where does that  fear come from  on the fact  that we have  a case history  many of them  and it's not just  in our environment  where white bosses  fire white people  right  for saying  racially inappropriate  things  when any special  interest group  but if the threat  wasn't there  from black people  over sensitive  pseudo leadership  then the white  corporate  we know that  guys that are  at the top end  of these corporate  or corporations  believe me 
[00:16:30]  because of recent events  not even racially  financially  we know they're idiots  but it's not just  to me it's not just  the threat being there  and being pounded  we just try to do  a contest  we find a guy's  hairy red hiney  right right  and that was vetoed  by lawyers  there's no threat there  that was just  paranoid white people  thinking way too far  and it's like  that to me  is the problem  it's not like  Sharpton and them  have a power base  that's going to  really directly  affect the advertisers  that's really going 
[00:17:00]  to shut down business  because we do  black jokes  and man  when he comes  the big bully is here  to me he's a blowhard  and a jackass  and everybody by this point  knows it  we've had too long  of a history  with this guy  okay but do you think  take the Imus situation  because there's a few  you can choose from  take that  if not one black person  complained about that  would white management  looked at what happened  and said  yeah we gotta fire him  no  no  of course not  so who's putting the gun  to their dumb heads 
[00:17:30]  and making them  making them  have these  knee jerk reactions  where they fire people  there is a  there is a  a cloud  over America  where you cannot  open and honestly  talk about race  there is  like this gentleman  said  cowards  we are cowards  but we have been  put in that position  because  not because of  of stupid white bosses  that fire white people  there's someone else  at the top of that food chain  no way 
[00:18:00]  no I don't agree  it's black leadership  that is threatening  that uses  mob like tactics  mafia tactics  to go in  and extort  firings  from  white management  because the same  white management  and it's in radio  and it's in every  corporate environment  the same white management  fires people  in all instances  it's not just  when black  special interest groups  complain  it's when any  special interest groups  complain 
[00:18:30]  and primarily  when you look at the people  doing the firing  and again  it's not always  but primarily  they all look the same  they are the same people  who buckle the same way  and the reason that they fire  people so quickly  is because they're afraid  that anything racial  that goes on  they don't address properly  will be an insight  into their own racism  they're afraid of being exposed  because they're not honest  about the way they view race  like  they don't admit that  black people ever annoy them  we certainly admit  that black people  are annoying sometimes  and you know what  most black people 
[00:19:00]  admit that white people  are annoying sometimes  but you get into  those corporate situations  even among each other  they won't admit that  they won't admit that  among each other  they won't admit that  just in a group of friends  oh no  I don't  I don't  so afraid of being  misconstrued  even by other white people  well then  how do you explain  when  XM and Sirius  were separate entities  and Nate was in charge  and we met with Nate  who was a black gentleman  that ran the  boo  and he  I'm booing Nate 
[00:19:30]  because he wouldn't let me in  on that meeting  yes of course  see  because you're white  didn't even know you were alive  I know  I'm just so sad  he  completely  and he told us this  he agreed  with the fact  that Imus was fired  he then told  Opie and I  plain out  straight out  that  that type of  humor  and content  will not be tolerated  on a  a company  in a company  that he runs 
[00:20:00]  it was  a veiled threat  not from white management  right  from a black man  running a company  talking to two white  on air personalities  threatening us  that if we got  into racial trouble  he would not stand behind us  and we would be fired  first of all  that nerd  like classical music  he's not a typical black guy  but yeah  is he a corporate guy  yes  I'm not saying  look dude  no one is saying  and white people  are 100% right  and honest  and wonderful  and we're terrible  but you get into  the corporate world  everybody stinks 
[00:20:30]  but I'm saying  that the day to day  dishonesty  that to me  that whether  Holder's talking  about that or not  that day  and I deal with  audiences  I'm on stage  I do racial jokes  and you know who laughs  primarily the people  who groan  are the white people  other white people  groan  when you do  certain black references  and black people  even if they don't laugh  very rarely  do you see a bunch  of black people  going oh  hey  I see it night  after night  ask Nick DiPaolo  who the ones  groaning 
[00:21:00]  it's a bunch  of babyish  white people  it's not black  bullies in the audience  it's 98% white people  and that 98%  is so afraid  jeez I'm screaming  I'm sorry  is so paranoid  about the 2%  seeing what they're  really like  and there's no threat  of being fired there  that's social cowardice  you're right  you're right  but it came from somewhere  I think the white guilt  is a huge part of it  but I don't think  it's as big as people  people like putting  the white guilt tag  on things  I think 
[00:21:30]  we are very afraid  of discussing race  in front of black people  seeing what has happened  in the past  with the way  the black power base  has gotten to the point  where they can  get you fired  but that's a recent phenomenon  that's like the last  X amount of years  but you're right  but so is this cowardice  it really is  I think we used to discuss  and use race  in entertainment  and stuff  a hell of a lot more  than we used to  watch old footage  of racial discussions 
[00:22:00]  in the 50s and 60s  races  I'm not talking about  going that far  I don't mean  class race  70s  things like that  all in the family  things like that  we used to be able  to look at race  and discuss it  and use it in humor  a lot more  than we can today  the more power  that black America  seems to get  the more we're  pushed back  into this  place where we  can't really openly  and honestly discuss it  in a way  where we disagree  it is a self  it is a self push 
[00:22:30]  it is not  the push by black people  is not strong enough  to get us  or to get white America  the 12%  or whatever it is  didn't push the  75% or 80%  into a corner  the guilt  or whatever you want  to call it  whatever term  you want to put  on it  people put  themselves in that  corner  it is a self  flagellation  we got to  take a break  but the Anthony  and B*** lover  show will be back  the phones are lit  I want to know  what Holder wants 
[00:23:00]  from America  what the answer  to this whole thing  is  and also of course  Sharpton is protesting  today  we will get into that  we got some audio  and he was all over  TV last night  yes he was  I mean  when is someone  going to call him out  and say look  you're  you know  again  no one calls him out  I called him out  in song Opie  I called him out  oh where is the Reverend Al song  I did it in print  I love it  when I could play  my favoritest song  I ever sang  in my life  we'll play the Reverend Al song  after the break  yes Jimmy did it in print  but Keith Overman 
[00:23:30]  last night  I was watching  was just kissing his ass  oh of course  completely kissing his ass  and all these guys  kiss his ass  which gives him more power  one of these guys  on TV  has to go look  well Keith Overman  is a great example  of that  Keith Overman  is not necessarily afraid  but he's a groveling  liberal jackass  look at the way  he treated Jesse Jackson  he wouldn't call  Jesse Jackson  out on anything  he used the angle  that they used  chimps to parody  like Bush and stuff  and then Keith Overman  added last night 
[00:24:00]  but I'm proud to say  that I never did that  shut your mouth  you phony crock  he goes sir  he goes sir  I'm proud to  to tell you  that I wasn't  one of those people  what's it called  he leaves that pat  it has been used  you know  as far as Bush goes  but I was never  one of those people sir  maybe we can get that clip  it made me puke  in my mouth last night  Opie and Anthony  stay there  good morning to everybody  it's the Opie and Anthony show  starring Jim Norton 
[00:24:30]  it's going to be  a busy morning  a little later on  chimp lady  does yapping yapping  yapping all over the place  oh yeah  she said this  until you've eaten  with a chimp  bathed with a chimp  you don't know a chimp  maybe not his last meal  I'll have my friend's jawbone  three teeth and a scream  apparently that chimp  took out her eyes  her jawbone  her face  and her jaw  just ripped  ripped her face off 
[00:25:00]  I was listening to  a tape  yesterday  of the police transmission  from the time  they got the 911 call  till the time  they shot the chimp  and didn't know  where it was  so they were kind of  looking for it  right  and  one of the cops  sounded a bit shaken up  and he goes  you gotta get EMS here  quick  because  this guy  ain't got a face  and they couldn't even tell  it was a woman  wow  they said this guy  we have a gentleman  this gentleman's  in bad shape 
[00:25:30]  no face  no jaw  so the thing  can't bite the chimp  yeah  the chimp  that's what they do  in the wild  pull the jaw off  rip the eyes  and nose out  fingers too  it's a big divot  you hear how stupid  the victim was though  what  different hairstyle  different car  waving an Elmo doll  on her face  like here  look what I got for you  you shouldn't have  picked up the  maulmy Elmo though  right  that one  just dumb  it speaks in chimp  and just says  screw you  I hate you  you're ugly  there's so much going on 
[00:26:00]  we're gonna get into  the cartoon thing  and the Sharpton  you know  doing his protest  outside News Corp today  and we're talking about  this Eric Holder thing  that he's saying  we're a nation of cowards  on racial matters  and  Jimmy brought up  the South Park clip  where the answer is  Naggers  and we want to play that  for everybody  because it really proves  you know  hammers a lot of the points  that you guys just made  home  and we can't play the clip  because of the  we can't play a clip  that was on South Park  because even in context 
[00:26:30]  right  the N word  which to me is an example  of where  the justifiable excuse  of no no  Naggers was the right answer  actually makes sense  whereas to me  it's kind of a thin argument  for the cartoon  sure  we can't even play it  in that context  and again  we can't even play it  as adults  yes  because having a reasonable  discussion about race  this is  this is my point  also  in context  we should absolutely  be able to play that clip  and have that word 
[00:27:00]  go out over the airwaves  in context  it's not inciting  it's not hateful  it's not  it's being used  as an example  of the discussion  that we're having  but  there is such a fear  over this country  that that word  can't be used  in any circumstance  anymore  which is crazy  except you know  a rap artist  today it should be  allowed  we're having  an intellectual  conversation  about race 
[00:27:30]  and it hammers  the point home  and what was the  what was the statement  and we don't blame  it's not Jib  we don't blame Jib  and blame Jib  and the guy  who's keeping us  safe down the hall  he plays it to himself  all the time  he's just taking orders  from above  they're not above anymore  they're right in this building  he sings that word  to the happy birthday  to me song  what did he say though  basically that word  is nuclear  Patrice isn't even  allowed to use it  on the air  it's amazing like  it went in stages  by the way  because it was  we had it to a point 
[00:28:00]  where our black friends  could come in here  and if they want to  say the n-word  they're allowed  but now they've  taken that away too  and we were talking  which is crazy  that's insane  one of the things  about like  with the black groups  being bullying  or pissing everybody off  and this is what  Anthony and I were  just discussing  is that  one thing I thought of  was that  one of the problems  is the reason  they buckle so fast  is because  none of these guys  and I mean  these white guys  have honest  racial discussions  even with each other  they don't  but with black people 
[00:28:30]  never  it's almost like  I forget sometimes  that there are  people don't have  guys like Patrice  or Keith  or just guys  that I've known  for 15 years  who you're brutally  honest with each other  like when the OJ thing  happened  we were screaming  at each other  I'm no doubt  but you watch  the rest of society  oh my god  they couldn't believe it  because they never have  honest racial discussions  with each other  yeah you walk out  of your house  you see a black guy  maybe you've known him  for a few years 
[00:29:00]  and you just would put  your head down  after the OJ thing  I don't want to discuss it  I can't discuss it  I don't know what to say  let's go to the phones  come on  be open  be honest  speak your mind  they've been sitting here  for 40 minutes  let's say hi to JT  a black guy  from South Jamaica  hi JT  what's up guys  you know  I'm a cop in the city  you know  me and my partner  is here listening to your show  I'm black  he's white  we have open  racial conversation  every night  without a problem  and I'm just tired  you know  I mean  not just you guys  but just people saying 
[00:29:30]  that you know  Sharpton is all black leaders  Sharpton is not a black leader  oh no I know  believe me  I said self-appointed  self-anointed  this guy  is not  a black leader  but he  he is looked at  as one  I know a lot of black people  don't agree  well Whitey thinks  he's a black leader  that's for sure  they put him on TV  like he's a black leader  the second something happens  that's who you see on TV  that's their go-to guy  and I definitely agree  with Jim  when he says  you know  it's more white people  who feel guilty 
[00:30:00]  they have white guilt  about something  and they just  they kiss his ass  they just kiss up  there's a catalyst  for that fear  and guilt though  the guilt is one thing  the guilt  I don't know  where that comes from  I gotta be honest with you  I don't feel  an iota  an ounce  of guilt  for slavery  for the situation  that black people are in  I don't feel it  I never have  I will never take  responsibility  for something  that I had nothing  nothing 
[00:30:30]  to do with  so I have  no white guilt  trust me  on this one  fear  fear  hold on  hold on  part two  is the fear  do I have fear  of black people  yes I do  and I don't mean  physically  and stuff like that  we joke about it  a lot on the air  but the truth of the matter  is  I have fear  of black people  for me  saying something  and keeping  my god  effing job  that's where  my fear  comes in  not that I'm 
[00:31:00]  gonna be mugged  or this  or that  or the other  thing  it's a fear  that you guys  have a power base  that can take  my livelihood  away  based on  something that  comes out  of my  stupid ass  shock  jockey mouth  and plus  one thing I'll say  about Sharpton  he's definitely  black people hate  when he's called  a black leader  yeah I know  but in fairness  black people  like him being around  because he's annoying  to white people  and you never see  black people publicly  really separating  themselves from Sharpton  you don't often  hear black people 
[00:31:30]  blasting him publicly  so when the media  does take this  self-appointed idiot  and say he's a black leader  you don't hear a voice  from black people  going he's not a leader  except for a guy like you  who will call up  and say that  occasionally you do  you get a couple  of black republicans  maybe on Fox  that come out  and speak against Sharpton  and then he's called  it Uncle Tom  in two seconds  yeah  so you know  it's a no win scenario  to me fellas  it's just like  anytime I just see  Sharpton on TV  like you was talking 
[00:32:00]  about the cartoon  yesterday and today  I mean yeah  maybe it was racist  but as soon as he  gets involved with it  it's just like  to me  you know what  I don't want to be  bothered with it  everything is forgiven  that's how I feel  when he jumps in  all is forgiven  and two cops  having racial discussions  are not exactly like  are not exactly  the average two people  that'd be hysterical  what does your partner  just tase you all day  do you guys dream  of making a buddy film  do you scream  at some point  both at the same time 
[00:32:30]  go holy  and you go  I'm too old  for this crap  shut the post down  shut the post down  African American leaders  from every corner  of New York  rushed to denounce  the post cartoon  they compared it  to the most  vile racial insults  Barack Obama  he's not a coon  he's not a jugglenut  he's not a monkey  news story  black guy saying  the n-word  we have to beep it 
[00:33:00]  you gotta stop  did we have to  corporates gotta stop  that went out  over the news  I think that was  beeped on the news  so they're doing it too  alright I apologize  to this dumb company  you know what  in general  we gotta stop  that is  it is infuriating  to me  I'm not happy  that we're not  allowed to say it  but at the very least  if a black guy  wants to say  the n-word  so be it  I think we all  should be able  to say it  trust me  but it's getting  to the point  where now  you're beeping  when a black guy  says it  one or the other  it's what was said 
[00:33:30]  if you don't want  him saying it  edit it out  of your broadcast  whatever  oh my god  I apologize  to this company  it's a wider  problem  I'm disgusted  it is  we've gotten  very just silly  and childish  and again  it is this climate  of fear  and dishonesty  it's childish  that we don't  even look at things  we're a nation  of children  of little  of little  diaper wearing  babies  and going back  to Eric Holder  US a nation  of cowards  on racial matters 
[00:34:00]  and look at  what the news  does  they're scared  to get the  n-word out there  in context  with that guy  to say  we're making  a good point  he was talking  about this  and he should  be allowed  to say that  but they beep it  amazing  she's a nation  of children  he's not a  juggledut  he's not a  n***h  he's not  a monkey  he's not  all those  things  that our  foreparents  had to hear  and read  the post  says it was  a spoof  of this week's  Stanford  Connecticut  chimp attack  but civil rights 
[00:34:30]  activists say  it is racist  code  comparing Barack  Obama to an  ape  who needs to  be shot  you know what  the cartoonist  knew he could  get away with  one  and he could  explain you know  another angle  that's all  I don't think  he's saying  Obama needs  to be shot  by the way  I think  that's  the chimp  was shot  so that's  how they  portrayed it  and that was  the whole gist  of the cartoon  and the way  he portrayed it  was the chimp  is shot  he's no longer  alive  so he can't 
[00:35:00]  write another  stimulus bill  that you know  that was his  point  regardless of  if he meant  if he wanted  that to symbolize  Obama  Congress  just some  dummy  who typed  it up  being a  monkey  you know  that  you could  go around  and around  with that  you'll never  really know  his intentions  that are in  his head  he knew  people were  going to  think  this way  but there's  enough element  of doubt  in there  and enough  explanations  that he's  safe  as far as  that's  concerned 
[00:35:30]  sure  we do that  on a daily  basis  on our show  that's what  I was saying  right  we skirt  issues  we do  things  what the  frig  you think  this means  Jesus Christ  but I'm just  saying he knew  that people  were going  to go  wow  look what  this guy  is saying  he's not  dumb  and let me  tell you  what I did  today  I went  to the post  and went  right to  that cartoon  section  to see  what today's  was going  to be  if it was  going to be  a little  shaky  or something  that might  get him  in trouble  so it  worked  it got 
[00:36:00]  me to  look at  his stupid  little comic  it's going  to be  interesting  to see  how this  plays out  usually  people get  fired  but I  don't know  I don't  know  it says  a lot  if you  turn around  and fire  Dilbert  should start  doing this  and people  would just  look every  day  the N  word  fire the  Dilbert  creator  for  nonsense  for boring  the hell  out of us  for many  many years  but if  Dilbert  started using  the N  word  around the  office  you would  look every  day  sure 
[00:36:30]  when I  saw this  stick in  my face  this morning  I wanted  to know  who's  entertained  by that  kind of  depiction  of anybody  this is the  artist  Sean Delonis  he is  responsible  and the  post supports  him  and we  will not  support the  post  cartoonist  Sean Delonis  has not  addressed the  drawing  protesters  are now  demanding  he be  fired  they want  an apology  from the  New York  post  shut up  advertising  boycott  of the  paper  there you  go  see  it's 
[00:37:00]  based  in  fear  it's  extortion  it's  mob  mafia  tactics  don't blame  the guy  with the  gun to his  head  Jimmy  you have  to say  you're acting  like the  gun was  put there  this guy  did something  purposeful  and thoughtfully  and legal  and part of  the first  amendment  yes and so  is a protest  totally legal  alright  no  they're  they're  not just  protesting  they're  demanding  his  firing  lest 
[00:37:30]  they  start  a  boycott  against  advertisers  this goes  beyond it  it's  extortion  it's very  legal  it's legal  but it's  extortion  it should  not  work  the people  at the  post  should not  buckle  to it  they shouldn't  people do  have the right  whether it's  radio or anything  if they don't  like something  they go  we're not  going to  support  these  advertisers  and you  know what  when Imus  was getting  fired  and 30  or 40  people  were showing  up to  protest  people should  have seen  that  as this  is not 
[00:38:00]  going to  be  some  advertising  death of  advertising  and yet  look what  happened when  Jack Hafferty  said what  he said  and there  were a lot  of people  that showed  up  a lot  of Asians  Asian people  are very  organized  that fan  one  because they're  computer literate  I'm saying  of all Americans  I think Asians  are the ones  were the best  they started  Facebook  and social  networking  I really  do  and that's  why they  organized  very quickly  like look  at Jack  Jack Hafferty's  comment  and you know  what the network  stuck with him  and nothing 
[00:38:30]  happened  so even  with what  looked like  a gigantic  tidal wave  of problems  they said  no he's  not being  fired  and he  wasn't  fired  and nothing  happened  nothing  happened  it went  away  and we've  been saying  that for  years by  the way  just play  it out  even in the  face  of evidence  where it's  not going  to work  people still  fire people  but do you  realize what  we just  listened to  and what  we're seeing  on TV  do you realize  how frightening  that is  to these  ignorant  corporate  executives  that honestly 
[00:39:00]  look and go  oh my god  the blacks  are protesting  us  quick  fire everybody  I understand  what you're  saying  it's a  dumb  knee jerk  reaction  but it's  got to  start  somewhere  you can't  blame  a tsunami  on the  ocean  you gotta  look at  what happened  an earthquake  started it  you gotta  look at  the thing  that started  what then  cascades  into a  firing  it's not  just  it doesn't  start with 
[00:39:30]  the stupid  white  executive  it starts  with a  very vocal  very  intimidating  black  or whatever  the race  may be  base  that  that  threatens  threatens  a company  unless  they  take  someone's  livelihood  and throw  it out  the goddamn  window  which will  happen  by the way  people will  be fired  you might  be right  this is a  tough one  this is a  very  clear cut  first amendment  case  it's the  press 
[00:40:00]  you're working  with a  newspaper  this is  an interpretable  political  cartoon  with  an element  of doubt  as to  if it is  racist  or not  whatever  there is  an element  of doubt  in there  they had  an explanation  for it  they used  it  they bashed  Sharpton  but it's not  going to be  worth fighting  is how they're  going to look at it  because they own  way too much  stuff  they don't just  own the newspaper  they own  the foxes  involved  right  yeah  Rupert Murdoch  Murdoch  Murdoch's not a pussy 
[00:40:30]  I'll say that  he's not  that's just it  he's not  that guy's  gone through  some crap  and he doesn't  buckle very easily  we'll see if they  think it's worth  fighting  I think they'll go  with the easy route  and they'll fire  some people  I'm telling you  answer right  with a political  cartoon  which annoys me  that they get  a certain level  of coverage  that we don't  especially since  the difference  between us  firing out jokes  or anybody  firing  is you're flying  you're doing  X amount of  new content  a day  hopefully  whereas with  a political  cartoon  there's a process 
[00:41:00]  it goes through  there's editors  there's a lot  of people  that look at it  it's not just  fired out  in a moment  so  I still don't  think they'll  fire the guy  at least I hope  they don't  yeah I hope  they don't either  they should not  fire him  no  but just say  look it was  tasteless  if the guy  has to apologize  and go look  I'm sorry  if people took  it that way  but here's what  I meant  that's what  you have to do  I don't think  an apology  is in order  either  I don't think  you have to  apologize  this is another  cowardice thing  why apologize  this is what  I did  this is my job  this is what 
[00:41:30]  I do  and you don't  like it  don't read it  you're saying  don't buy the  post  don't buy the  post  then don't buy it  then they don't  have to buy it  and so far  the guy  hasn't apologized  they told him  to shut up  obviously  he was yapping  a little bit  but now  he's silent  I don't know  how I feel  about an apology  not that I think  he should grovel  but it was like  to me  it was like  we all know  what you meant  and we know  it's almost like  when something  so obvious  is done  and people  yell and scream  about it  you don't have  to apologize  but if you  want it to go 
[00:42:00]  away  go look  I'm sorry  it happened  you took it  that way  yeah you know  what you're right  I'm wrong  he shouldn't  apologize  he shouldn't have  to apologize  is it tasteless  sure  the second I  looked at it  I was like  it wasn't even  that I was offended  because I wasn't  offended by it  but I looked at it  and just saw  trouble  I saw trouble  the second Jimmy  brought that up  yesterday  we all went  like uh oh  because we know  we're close  to a lot of  these situations  where we know  what means  trouble 
[00:42:30]  and that meant  trouble  to me  any bullets  though  any bullets  inside  of a thing  like that  even if that  was Bush  the monkey  reference  wouldn't have  touched off  what it did  because let's  be honest  it's safer  to say Bush  looks like a  monkey than  Obama  we all  understand why  it's safer  to say that  but the bullets  in any type  of a presidential  parody  are going to  be a problem  you can't have  a dead thing  with a smoking  gun  and reference  the president  it's going to  be a problem  matter how  you do  that  there's 
[00:43:00]  just something  interesting  with the  whole  equating  monkey  to black  man  thing  that I  understand  especially in  the past  that was  something that  was highly  offensive  it meant  one thing  one thing  only  but we  are in a  very progressive  age right  now in this  country  we're just  breaking into  it really  Obama's  president  a lot  of like I  said a lot  of black  true black 
[00:43:30]  leaders are  being appointed  to very high  offices  and you  can use  animals  to represent  people  it's been  done for  years  for years  and to  use something  as dumb  and stupid  and goofy  as a monkey  because monkeys  are they're  dumb stupid  goofy things  to equate  that to a  person  doesn't have  to be  racist  it doesn't  right at face  value  it does not  have to be  racist  but again  in certain 
[00:44:00]  cases  we all  have the  commonality  of language  and of  knowing what  certain things  mean  if you had  this cartoon  and it was a  Jewish guy  getting out of  an oven  and there was  some reference  to X amount  of a million  even if it  somehow tied  in politically  everyone would  know  we know  what you're  telling us  because political  cartoons have to  get things across  in one panel  they have to  get a tremendous  amount of  thought across  in one panel  so everybody  would know  what he was  saying  or if you  had  whatever the  case is  we would  know what 
[00:44:30]  he was  saying  it's like  that's part  of what  they're good  at  is getting  their point  across  in one  quick panel  so for him  to come out  and go  no I didn't  mean the  holocaust  what I meant  was because  Jewish people  do technically  own pizzerias  oh yeah  okay  in a court  of law  maybe  you could  skirt the  issue  but you're  in a job  where you're  conveying a  thought  with one  panel  everyone  knows  the thought  you were  conveying  at least  when it  comes down  to it  you can't  say  I didn't  mean that 
[00:45:00]  when everybody  knows you  did mean  that  at least  own up to  it and say  I meant it  and then take  the hit for it  if you're  going to go  through that  process  well that's  the fear  factor again  if you do  fess up to it  instead of use  that little  element of doubt  he's using  an element of  doubt  he's using  the fact that  I do have  a different  explanation  for what this  means  and I think  with the  thing you said  with the Jewish  person  if he's in  the oven  things like  that  there's a  problem  if you just  show a Jewish  guy near  an oven  doing something  again you can  then skirt the 
[00:45:30]  issue and maybe  come up with  another reason  for it  and be fine  because there's  an element of  doubt  and you don't  have that  pall of fear  over you  okay well  how about a  Jewish guy  like a  stereotypical  Jewish guy  looking in  the oven  and going  oh it's  my uncle  whatever the  news story  tied in  everyone would  think the  gas chamber  and it would  be the  intent of  the cartoon  for you  to think  the gas  chamber  so when  people go  wow that's  kind of  tasteless  you can't  go what  do you  mean it's  tasteless  but what  if let's  say  alright there 
[00:46:00]  was a  Ponzi scheme  going on  this Jewish  guy was  found that  day by  police hiding  in his  oven  now that's  what I'm  saying  right  it's all  ridiculous  that's a  perfectly  acceptable  that then  would be a  comic  sure  and it would  be pertinent  to the news  that it  happened the  prior day  absolutely  but then you'd  be like  oh my god  showing a  Jew in an  oven  that's  horrible  you're  right  but  there'd be  an excuse  for it  if there was  actually a  primate  that had  come up 
[00:46:30]  with this  bill  and had  actually  penned it  like if  Coco the  gorilla  had penned  this bill  and then  they referenced  the  I'm still  trying to  figure that  one out  and then  they referenced  the shot  chimpanzee  and go oh  gorilla did  technically do  it  shot chimpanzee  does make  sense  that's the  same if the  Jewish guy  was found  in the  oven  to reference  it with  a Jewish  guy oven  direct  connection  which makes  sense  I think  no I  got you  on that  one  let's see  what Al  Sharpton  is saying  to act  as though  the president  of the United  States  who is 
[00:47:00]  synonymous  and  personified  that bill  is the  equivalent  of a  shot  chimpanzee  or monkey  speaks to  all of the  racial stereotypes  and offenses  that we had  to deal  with  historically  the New York  Post is not  backing down  tonight  editor-in-chief  Cole Allen  issued a  statement  saying  the cartoon  is a clear  parody of a  current news  event  to wit  the shooting  of a  violent  chimpanzee  in Connecticut  it broadly  mocks  Washington's  effort  to revive  the economy  again  Al Sharpton  reveals himself  as nothing  more than  a publicity  opportunist  what Sharpton 
[00:47:30]  said there  though  and believe  me  I hate  him  was  correct  like  what he  said  there  was not  lunatic  I mean  they might  have edited  it  but that  little clip  of Sharpton  in that  moment  it wasn't  nuts  what he  just said  I like  the fact  that the  editor  of course  is going  to defend  it  because  the editor  is the  one who  probably  gave  the  okay  for  to go  through  why did  I do  that  I am  agreeing  that  and I  said it  before  that  at a  time  that was  just an  awful  horrible  thing  but we're  in a  very  progressive  state  right now  where 
[00:48:00]  a black  man is  president  in the  United  States  a lot  of black  power  is  in  place  and I  think  we can  start  delving  into  these  things  that  formerly  were  offensive  racist  but  can  now  be  taken  as  political  parity  without  this  fear  this  cloud  of fear  that has  to  just  reside  over  every  single  white  person  that  we're  going  to  say  something  that's 
[00:48:30]  going  to  just  disconnect  us  from  our  livelihood  do  you  know  I  know  we  have  to  break  but I  tell  you  when  people  call  in  if  I've  said  believe  me  I've  written  things  that  I've  done  racist  jokes  sure  I'm  never  afraid  honestly  of  defending  what  I've  said  to  black  people  I  never  am I  afraid  to have  a black  guy  call  in  because  black  people  understand  please  you think  I don't  know how you're  talking about the barber shop  like come on  but my  discomfort is trying to  defend it to other  white people who won't  admit that they think  that way  that's true  it's harder  much harder 
[00:49:00]  we'll continue  if you're on hold  stay right there  right after the break  we'll go right to the  phones  we're gay  perfect day to play the  Reverend Al song  here it is  Opie and Anthony  comes running when the cops get out of hand  who thinks the mayor's in the cool clubs clan  yelling and a screaming as he's speaking to a mob  he wears expensive suits but he doesn't have a job  Reverend Al  Reverend Al  he's your pal

[00:51:30]  phone's lit today  we like this  we like this position  you got the people agreeing  you got the people disagreeing  you got the people agreeing with one person on the show  and others agreeing with another person on the show  the guy in the middle going  what do you want from me  let's go to Mike in New York  Mike  Mike  hey Mike  Mike  oh Mike  come on Mike  what are you doing man  how are you doing there Mike 
[00:52:00]  hello there  listen thank you for taking my call  alright what do you got  alright  I am a perfect example  of what happens when you speak out for yourself  now I know you guys are busy  but first of all  Jim Norton  I can't wait to see you up at Fishkill  thank you buddy  I was a bus driver  and I had a Spanish kid on my bus  who was very rude  gas  sexual innuendo  he was grabby with his hands  he was a punk  and I sat him down behind me  as soon as he opened his mouth 
[00:52:30]  did something rude  I'd sit him down behind me  well lo and behold  I was labeled a racist  I was called before members of the Board of Education  I was called before the parents  and I was called in front of him also  and other members of the bus administration  and they said  the kid spoke his piece and labeled me a racist  and they looked at me and they go  well what do you have to say for yourself  I said this meeting is going to last two minutes  I said first of all  I don't pander 
[00:53:00]  I don't apologize  I'm politically incorrect  and I don't buckle  I said  did you really start off your discussion with that awful statement?  I certainly did  I looked at the parents  and I said  I'll be out of here in two minutes  I said  your son is a punk  has nothing to do with race  he's loud  he passes gas  he burps  he passes sexual innuendo  I said  now  the meeting is now over  fire me  or I go back to work  he used the old red from Shawshank strategy 
[00:53:30]  trying to get out  and finally got accepted  I told  but it didn't work for him I bet  I told all of those people  in front of them all  there was some big shots there  from the Board of Education  I said  this meeting lasts two minutes  don't think  I pander  buckle  apologize  and I'm politically incorrect  the kid is a punk  tell us what happened  did you get fired?  no  they said  Mr.  well I'm not going to give my name  Mr.  go back to work  I think that he's  really paraphrasing 
[00:54:00]  now  I don't think that you said that  and they went  Mr.  so and so  go back to work  I have more faith  in Harrison Ford  damn you  shame on you  Mr.  President  alright thank you Mike  he doesn't buckle  pander  simmer down Mike  out of all the phone calls  we could have chosen  everyone wants in today  Scott on Long Island  let's go  hey what's going on guys  hey Scott  yeah you guys are saying  that like  all these like 
[00:54:30]  black pseudo-leaders  are like the mafia  but they're actually  way worse man  these guys are terrorists  their battle cry  is no justice  no peace  that means  if they don't get their way  they're going to start  beating the crap out of people  no it doesn't sir  sir  you're wrong  no justice  no peace  means social disorder  it doesn't mean  we're going to beat  the crap out of people  it means we're going to  disrupt the system  by protesting and stuff  I'm not saying  I like to hear that  but you can't  you can't say  it's something  that's not  no I got you 
[00:55:00]  sometimes their definition  of justice  is a little askew  it's a little  kooky  you know  there is justice  sometimes  they see injustice  where it isn't  and that's what  gets frustrating  but  alright thank you  let's go to Graham  in Pennsylvania  trying to get a lot  of people in today  Graham how are you buddy  love your crackers  how's it going  I just wanted to say  that  you know  people can't speak  openly about race 
[00:55:30]  these days  because  there's still a lot  of older black people  around that really  went through real racism  you're a black guy  and you're named  after a cracker  well  I'm Nick  I'm only a quarter  of a black  well his real name  is G Ram  but he knew  that we wouldn't  be able to say that  so he just said Ram  I'm G Ram  I figured  in a couple of years  you know  20-30 years  when the older black people  aren't around anymore  then people will be able  to pull the curtain  back a little bit 
[00:56:00]  because the word  the n-word  will have  lose its potency  a little bit  we've gave  that word  a lot of power  lately  yeah  a lot of power  they're beeping  it on the news  now  I think also  though  the thing of it  is that  I mean  black people  don't like  white people  to use the n-word  because  I don't think  in history  too many white people  have ever  the n-word  has been the last  thing they heard  before they were  beaten to death  or lynched  you know what the thing is 
[00:56:30]  I understand that  and I understand  that argument  but I don't  agree with it  at all  because that's  not happening now  when the white man  drops the n-bomb  it doesn't mean  that there's a beating  or a lynching  coming next  it's just  it's a word  now  it's a word  what it represented  years ago  sure  that was  you know  pretty horrible  and bad things  were happening  you know  it was  like you said  followed up  with a beating 
[00:57:00]  or a lynching  or whatever  but now  it's a word  that can't even  be used  in the context  of discussing race  or discussing  the word  you can't even  use the word  to discuss  the word  yes  or a hot chick  I banged  right  I don't know  I'm just saying  you know  let the older  black people  have their dream  and then when  they're gone  you know  I mean  you know  but you know  what  it's not even  about the older  black people  it is about  the younger  people are  usually the more 
[00:57:30]  hypersensitive  they are  you look at  college students  now  and racially  they're just  awful  they're the worst  they have such  a guilt complex  and they have  almost no connection  to race  or anything bad  that's happened  it's just  it's silly  it's getting worse  thank you Graham  I want to get  a lot of people  in here  thank you  because we got  Ray  for the discussion  he wants everyone  to know he's black  and what do you want  to say about  that cartoon Ray  you can call me Ray  but she doesn't  have to call me  what's up Ray 
[00:58:00]  hey what's going  on fellas  hey man  Dr. 2  was racist  but  this is my argument  there's one guy  that should be  offended by it  and that's Obama  you know what I'm saying  you think Obama  will come out  and say something  about the cartoon  no way right  he won't give it  any creeds  no effing way  I don't think so  I won't give it  any creeds  yeah  boy  this is my  you know what I'm saying  my little sentence  on it  I'm a black guy 
[00:58:30]  and  you know what I'm saying  I'm a truck driver  you know what I'm saying  I  basically do  just south  you know what I'm saying  Alabama  what do you call  honey  yeah  you know what I'm saying  you know  Anthony  you know  CB radio  so you know  what goes on there  oh yeah  it's pretty much  racist jokes  back and forth  right  but this is what  happened to me  about a year ago  when those  you know  there was a 
[00:59:00]  white guy  that came up to me  you know  I'm 6'2  we know I'm 500 pounds  white guy  came up to me  about  about 55 years old  and called me  the N-word  right in my face  so  at that point  I'm gonna be  you know  I'm gonna be  ignorant about it  so what I did was  I beat his ass  that's what I did about it  well the guy  quite frankly  the guy deserved it  if he just walked up to you  and said that  I mean  that's it  but  there  there are different ways 
[00:59:30]  of using different words  and  if you want to use  that word  in a conversation  that discusses race  in an intelligent manner  that isn't inciting anything  it isn't  it isn't  used as hate speech  it's  it's a conversation  maybe about  like I said  about the word itself  it should be used  openly and honestly  between any  person of any race  should be able to use it  in that context  Mr. Kumi  this is only  don't  you know  this is my point  I don't mind 
[01:00:00]  people using the word  cause  it is a word  and words don't hurt me  you know what I'm saying  you can do what you want  right  you know  you can say  whatever you want to say  as long as you don't bring it  you know what I'm saying  to my face  it's all good  sticks and stones  may break my bones  and so will a big black fist  if I say it to the wrong person  why would you say that  to a 6'2 black guy  exactly  the guy's insane  alright Ray  we gotta let you go  thanks man  speaking of Obama  I have not seen the cartoon 
[01:00:30]  he told reporters  aboard Air Force One  as he returned to Washington  from Arizona  where he announced  his plan to deal  with the foreclosure crisis  but I don't think  it's altogether newsworthy  reading the New York Post  so he's  he's slamming the New York Post  as a little  as a little rag  I hear you  if they ask him about  A-Rod steroids  you know one of these  dumb reporters  you're gonna ask him  about a cartoon  yeah of course  let's say hi to  Eddie in Stony Brook  Eddie  hey how are you fellas  I just wanted to say  that Jimmy is 100%  correct on this 
[01:01:00]  the Reverend Al  quote unquote  the Reverend  he's a beggar win  and as long as the Post  holds their ground  absolutely nothing's  gonna happen  and that's the bottom line  you know  and he's also right  with the  you know  when you tell a racist joke  or whatever  you have some sort of  racial discussion  you feel more uncomfortable  talking to another white person  than you actually do  talking to somebody of color  you know  if no one gets  if no one gets fired  you know  Sharpton's gonna lose  a lot of power  so if the Post just  holds their ground  you know  I think they looked at him 
[01:01:30]  a long time ago  you know  that whole  Toronto Brawley thing  I mean  he lost a lot of credibility there  he hasn't though  he's still  he's still the go-to guy  on every news program  amazing  everyone says that he lost  credibility with that  he really didn't  amazing  he's still the guy  you don't hear a peep  from Mason and Maddox  are they still alive even  you don't hear  but Reverend Al  became this  suit wearing  politician now  when he was involved  in one of the most  scandalous  racially  subversive 
[01:02:00]  I don't know  the city was on edge  because of  what happened  but I hate the people  that say that he lost  credibility from that  he really didn't  no  he's definitely  we kind of ignore  that whole thing  as far as  what went on  a national name  Sharpton  Anthony said before too  he's a really weird thing  why would the  to me  it's almost like  he is  what black people are  according to  like I think  most liberal democrats  and I know some of you  are going to get pissed at me  for saying that  but he's this 
[01:02:30]  knee jerk reaction  really very little  substance type of guy  they don't seem to address  black guys  that have a lot  of substance  it's guys like  obviously Obama has it  but why would a guy  like him  get that much  respect  in the democratic  national convention  where they're meeting  with him  they invite him  to the convention  they let him speak  they let him do this  why would you give  this guy  I think it's white guilt  I think you're right  that's the theme today  they feel that if they  bring him in  that oh ok  look at me  I'm good 
[01:03:00]  I'm not a racist  I'm not this  they go overboard  he's an example  like Jimmy was saying  though that got me  because he is an example  of somebody  that can keep  the black race down  his job depends on  blacks not excelling  and succeeding  and becoming accepted members  of the political system  in this country  and everything else  he doesn't want that  or he's sunk 
[01:03:30]  he's out of a gig  he loves being able  to go to the post  and get his face  on the news  and do these things  and when you get  a black president  and a lot of black people  getting into power  it scares the crap  out of him  I bet  I'd love to hear  a guy like Jeremiah Wright  and what he has to say  about this  I really  it was amazing  how out of touch  with people  people were shocked  that Jeremiah Wright  said  how could he  how could he say  these things  doesn't it sound  so dated 
[01:04:00]  even at this point  someone like  Reverend Al  doing something like this  doesn't it sound  passe  and like  you know  a few years back  this kind of flew  but now  Reverend Al  it just  it doesn't quite have  that bite  it used to have  because  of this new  progressive nature  this direction  the country's moving into  whether you  buy it  like it or not  believe me  I'm not very happy  with the way things are going  but  it's the way things are going  and  Reverend Al 
[01:04:30]  now is looking  more like a dinosaur  in  his tactics  and what he's saying  and doing  not today though  he's on every news  program  he's on the news  but again  you know  you could be on the news  and look like a complete idiot  and  hopefully  that's the way  this will turn out  Carl in Baltimore  Carl  Hey Anthony  I did want some of them  french fried potaters  where are you working  Carl  Bill Cox's outfit  what I want to say 
[01:05:00]  is they say  I'm a black male  45 years  so I've been looking  to you guys  since any W  and I'm a truck driver  and I like NASCAR  okay  that's great  yeah  just real quick  basically  I want to know  when Reverend Al  became appointed  the black leader  because I didn't get  to vote  okay  on that  alright  he's self-appointed  I want to say this  to my president  out there  make your own  decision  okay  if you see something  that offends you  from a book  to a movie  to something  you will hide it 
[01:05:30]  yourself  god damn  don't let nobody else  tell you what to do  I mean Jesus  come on now  you guys want to have  equality  then think on yourself  don't let nobody else  tell you  that is the best  god damn thing  I've ever heard  because it is  you're an individual  you don't need  this group mentality  with some ring leader  telling you how  you're supposed to feel  I agree  we got one more  before the break  Henry  from Tennessee  Henry  Henry  yeah  I just  every time  I listen to you guys  have a conversation 
[01:06:00]  on the black  you know  what's wrong with it  or you know  who's talking for it  it's just  it's kind of  almost insulting  to hear you guys  tell us what  needs to be done  when you're not  even a member of it  and so you've got  these glasses on  that change  your perspective  well maybe  we're an outside  looking in  kind of perspective  on the whole thing  and that gives  a kind of a different  outlook on it  than you have  yeah but just like  any other group  you can't say that  you know  David Duke talks  for white people 
[01:06:30]  and saying  this guy  every time  you have a white  issue  David Duke  comes out  and speaks for it  it's a complicated  group of people  just like any other group  I know what it is  though  there is  there is a  there's more  of a  group mentality  when it comes  to  the black community  like the gentleman  said just before  there has to be  more individual  thought  without these  ringleaders  trying to tell  people  how they should  feel  if you're a 
[01:07:00]  black man  this is how  you're supposed  to feel  when you're  on the outside  you don't know  what goes on  around the black  dinner table  around the black  barbershop  there is that  kind of conversation  there is a  dialogue all the time  I live it  well no one  would disagree  with that  I'm just  on the outside  what I'm saying  is  you know  who decides  whether Reverend  Charles  Reverend Al Sharpton  is our leader  it's not the black  people  it's you know  media  you're right  you're right 
[01:07:30]  and it's almost  like he's just  a leftover  from the past  and he's just  a go to guy  but he does not  you never hear  black people go  like you know  what Al Sharpton  is right  I'll tell you  who is a black  leader  Farrakhan is a  black leader  Farrakhan is a guy  that legitimately  rallies people  like him or hate him  he hates white people  but I love Farrakhan  I love the fact  that he just  slams  he slams people  and doesn't care  what you think  of what he's saying  that's true  I like that 
[01:08:00]  he's honest  even if he's not right  you know  if you want to be upset  about something  Farrakhan speaks to you  right  just like if you had  you know  if you're angry  about politics  and you're a Republican  then maybe Hannity  or O'Reilly  speaks to you  but it speaks  to a portion  of our population  there's a portion  of our population  that are mad  about this or that  or the stories  our parents told us  when they were  growing up  during segregation  it's legitimately  upsetting  you know  but if you  sit there  and just think  about it all the time  you're going to be 
[01:08:30]  upset about it  you've got to let it go  you've got to do  what you have to do  now of course  but  it's not like  there's any  warm speaker  for the black  you know  that's good  you know something  that's nice to hear  because again  individual thought  individual motivation  that seems to be  the key to  being able to  look at things  and discuss things  open and freely  between each other  you know  I tell you  the group mentality  of African Americans  in America  I'll give you  a prime example 
[01:09:00]  someone told me  it's like being overseas  and seeing another American  it's just the courteous  all right  you know something  that's a damn good point  you're kind of like  hey yo  I am the only  black guy  in my office  so if one  let's buy  what efficient  workplace is this  hey how you doing man  I'll take  two of those sandwiches  oh Jesus  that's always the case 
[01:09:30]  and it's just because  we only make up  13%  yeah  if you were  13% of China  when you saw  another white person  you'd say  hey how you doing  well you probably  see him over  the other short people  you'd see him  five miles away  hey thanks a lot  Henry  Henry  let's take a quick break  let's take a quick break  black history month  let's dig into this  let's see who we're  looking at today  we're honoring  yeah honoring  sure  Opie and Anthony  to celebrate black history 
[01:10:00]  month  the Opie and Anthony  show is recognizing  those historic  african-americans  without whom  this country  would not be  the melting pot  it is today  today we honor  the happy-go-lucky  basehead  from the  Hughes brothers  1993 urban drama  menace to society  without a home  clean clothes  or a care in the world  this lovable  little scamp  although down  a few bucks  wouldn't be deterred  from his goal  bartering it first  for goods  then for services  check this out  man I got these burgers  man they some  double cheeseburgers  nigga I just ate  man I just ate 
[01:10:30]  boo I don't want  no motherfucking  cheeseburgers  man come on man  wait wait wait  wait man  man I suck your dick  come on man  just hook me up  what the fuck  you just say nigga  man I said I suck  your dick  come on man  just give me fuck  if at first  you don't succeed  try try again  bad pun intended  stay tuned  for more icons  of black history  man I suck your dick  on the Opie and Anthony  show  oh we got caught  I gotta tell people 
[01:11:00]  what just happened  Opie and Anthony  we're kinda hanging  through the commercials  and Danny noticed it too  there's a new  weather girl on  Fox 5 here in New York  I guess right  she looks like Cal Ripken  huh  that is Cal Ripken  yeah I noticed  I just noticed her  at the very beginning  of this week  I tried mentioning  to Travis  I was like  did you see the hips  on that new weather  girl  and he's like  no I missed it  I just noticed her  literally just now  she's got the biggest  breasts on TV  she's got a nice body  she makes Jill 
[01:11:30]  Nicolini look like  a flatso  this girl has huge boobs  you like her hips  oh yeah  I'm not really sure  if I like her  I mean but her  she has a nice set  like when you  when you can tell  that she has a really  nice ass  from the front  right  that's you know  then you know  there's something good  going on  I gotta take a look  at the hips next  because I was just  mesmerized by those  big boobies  and then  we're staring at them  and next thing you know  there's dead air  because we have to go  back on the air  we need to know  more about that  I'm gonna try and  find her name  and get some pictures  get a screen cap 
[01:12:00]  we'll throw it on  onaradio.com  maybe we got a new girl  maybe it's time  for a new girl  a new TV girl  I think I'm sworn off  of the news girls  wow  name Barbara Walters  you don't bang anyone  from TV  that's right  I looked at Danny  and Danny's like  I'm all over that  I've been all over that  since Monday  I was actually  I looked over at the TV  and I noticed that  Fox was doing the weather  and I was like  oh I get to see that girl again  I got all excited about it  why don't you  F and Cher  what's wrong with you  because she's mine  you can't  877-212-ON-A 
[01:12:30]  we gotta go to Patrice  the go-to guy of course  hey Patrice  how are you buddy  hey good morning  good morning man  Mr. Patrice O'Neal  hello  I'm sure you've seen  I haven't talked to Anthony  in such a long time man  I know  every time I'm in  you're out doing something wrong  yeah I was out for MLK  you came in  of course you were  I was out celebrating  the man's achievements  come on  I started taking it personal  I just didn't think 
[01:13:00]  you wanted to talk  to anybody black  anymore ever  of course you wasn't here  and now we talk again  and it's just some  ridiculous thing  but I've been listening  to y'all  like most of the morning  I mean I got nothing  to add man  for real  I mean it's just  I mean  it's so many  different levels  that I don't even think  should be approached  I think we're smarter  than the levels  that we're approaching  I think the monkey thing  I agree with Norton  because I think  he knew 
[01:13:30]  see the first instinct  is nah  white people  ain't stupid enough  to make a monkey  president monkey  shot joke  right  so it has to be  some deeper thing  he's trying to do  but I think  his deepness  he was counting  on being just  a smarmy cornball  and he was going  to use his  deepness  because I know  white people  ain't stupid enough  to do that  but I think  personally  here's the problem  it's just like  men  with women 
[01:14:00]  right now  it's so bad  to be  a feminist  I mean not a feminist  but a misogynist  and it's so bad  to be a racist  right now  that white people  are policing themselves  and I don't think  white people know  how to police themselves  when it comes to race  and also  it's another thing  of power corrupts  so if you got  the group  who was being  oppressed  now really in charge  it's the Asian thing  too  where Asians  as soon as people  stop paying attention  to Asians  and making  you know 
[01:14:30]  pulling the corn  your eyes apart  Asian jokes  are now  like terrible  Asians go  ooh  ooh  people are listening  to us  so they get  a little carried  away  and then the people  who are supposed  to police themselves  don't know how  so I think a lot  of times  white people  sit around  and wait  to try to figure  out how  they're supposed  to react to this  even if it's racist  I don't think  they know how  to react  for years  white people  didn't have to  worry about  offending anybody  or anything  we just  you know  as the white man 
[01:15:00]  went around  and told all the jokes  said whatever  we wanted  and like you said  now this self policing  it's like they're  running around  with chickens  without heads  but also  I have to  pretend  that I have to  listen to  white people  have a plight  like  that's one of the  things that  is hard for me  to listen to  and this is why  Anthony  you're a white  leader  and you don't  know it  it's the same  reason that  Al Sharpton  is a white  leader  I mean a black  leader  sorry  is that 
[01:15:30]  there's a lot  of people  who cannot  articulate their  emotions  into words  or thoughts  and  you speak  for  a lot  of white  guys  and white  women  who don't  know how  to turn  how they  feel  into what  they think  and Sharpton  does that  for a lot  of black  people  he turns  what we  might think  because innately  black people  just don't  like white  people  and a lot  of times  he might  know how  to articulate  what I'm  supposed to  do  as a black 
[01:16:00]  person  who doesn't  know how  to be  angry  with my  mind  as opposed  to my  gut  he's  the guy  and when  you get  into  your thing  you are  letting  white people  know how  to think  so that's  why you get  a lot of  people who  call in  I heard a few  like  yeah you know  Anthony I'm  going to say  what you said  but I'm  really not going to  have anything  much else  because I  didn't think  past that  so I'm  going to wait  for you to  say something  else too  so I can  articulate  how I feel  it's ridiculous 
[01:16:30]  I like the  fact that you're  comparing Anthony  to Al Sharpton  you don't know  how happy  that's making  me  I'm infuriated  by it  but that he  is  he knows  how to  take  emotion  and articulate  it  stay emotional  but also be  intelligent  about how  he feels  a lot of  people aren't  able to do  that  I'll let you  know on a  little secret  Patrice  when I'm  speaking like  that  and I  take a  little time  a little 
[01:17:00]  gap in my  speech  that right  there is  nothing but  hardcore  horridness  running through  my head  and I'm  trying to  figure out  how to  put it  out of  my mouth  in a way  that won't  get me  fired  absolutely  and the  thing that's  getting you  fired  is  self-white  policing  it's the  same thing  as a guy  if I do  a show  and a guy  goes  that was  inappropriate  and I tell  a guy  the word  inappropriate  is meant  for vaginas  to say  men 
[01:17:30]  we create  inappropriateness  so when a  guy tries  to police  madness  he sounds  stupid  and he's  a liar  so when  white people  start policing  whiteness  they're liars  they don't know  how to police  whiteness  so just  stay out  of the game  all the guy  gotta do  is go  look  I knew  it was  a little  racial  but I  didn't  know  so  don't  fire me  but just  tell me  what the  rules are  because I  think a lot 
[01:18:00]  of us  don't even  know what  the rules  should be  Al Sharpton  doesn't know  what the  rules should  be  he just  the reason  he's becoming  irrelevant  is because  he's screaming  the same  thing  as fire  fire this  guy  yeah  boycott  fire  boycott  fire  can we  get a  we get it  now  that's the  same song  but what's  firing gonna  do  it's just  like  it's a  system  that  the editor  is the  guy who  let that  go through 
[01:18:30]  it's the  same thing  again  with the  lying  it's the  thing  why I  don't give  a damn  about Alex  Rodriguez  but I'm  on his  side  cause the  other  liars  it's like  going after  people in the  80s who  did coke  you know  what I'm  saying  it's like  we know  everybody  was sticking  themselves  in the  booty  now  why are  you on  him  you  liars  yeah  stop  lying  and black 
[01:19:00]  people too  just stop  lying  we need to  come forward  and go look  let's be honest  white people  this is  you guys are  a million and  oh  this is our  chance to  abuse you  we're just  trying to  enjoy  a million  and oh  I love  white people  shaking in  their boots  I love  the fact  look  as an  intelligent  person  you know  that the  black  president  cannot do  black  things  we cannot  have white  slaves  we can't  do things 
[01:19:30]  that  you want  to do  we're not  going to be  able to do  it  but the  idea of  white people  nervous  it really  makes  it makes  me happy  but again  I said  before  I'm irrelevant  and I think  anybody  our age  talking about  this  is because  it's like  I'm like  the Independence  Day  aliens  when they  ask the  dudes  listen  can we  have peace  it's like  no peace  no  no peace  what do you  want  for you to die 
[01:20:00]  we're just  irrelevant  in this  world  right now  like  like  Norton  said  college  kids  they are  learning  how to  live  in a  world  of  lying  and they  don't know  how to  function  by being  honest  so they  live in  this awful  world  of lying  and  another  thing  is this  everybody  on this  show  everybody  who's  associated  with this  show  Nick  Colin  you  everybody  grew up 
[01:20:30]  as an  A crowd  person  and there's  only three  ways to be  an A crowd  person when  I grew up  that's to be  beautiful  strong  or funny  and right  now  for some  reason  C crowd  D crowd  and B crowd  people  get to have  a life  in the realm  of satire  and  and political  cartoons  and the  internet  this guy  who drew  that thing  political  cartoon  satirists  are corny  they shouldn't  be talked 
[01:21:00]  about  that  that cartoon  at his  best  was corny  and we're  talking about  them  about a  dying art  which is  newspapers  now everybody's  buying the  post today  it's a  bigger thing  and I think  we're  like all the  stuff you  talked about  it's been  an hour and  a half  you're giving  it way too  much  than what it  is  because it  really isn't  as big  as intelligent  people make  it  that's what  it is 
[01:21:30]  where it's  intelligent  people  abusing  people who  aren't  smart  you know  what though  the phones  are lit  whenever we  get into  a discussion  like this  and something  happens on  the news  like this  the phones  just lit  people  for some  reason  love the  opportunity  to discuss  race  racism  the races  but  when though  Anthony  they enjoy  it when  they can  be  this is why  I should 
[01:22:00]  wear a  crowd  they enjoy  it when  there's  nothing on  the line  they are  a person  behind  a blog  but for  real  you gotta  give Al  Sharpton  credit  when somebody  is putting  a plunger  in somebody's  place where  they ain't  supposed to  do it  he's in  your face  you're in  the face  of Al  and somebody  else is in  the face  of Jimmy  at least  that's when  honesty  is a big  thing  but right 
[01:22:30]  now  it's gonna  be people  on the  phone  who are  gonna go  somewhere  in the  bathroom  and say  what they  think  for two  seconds  and then  go back  to work  but honesty  starts  with you  phonies  phonies  and dishonest  people  get too  much credit  I don't know  I see it  like I was  talking to  Jimmy earlier  I don't see  it like  it's just  white people  being phonies  and being  scared  the intimidation  everybody  who allows  anyone  to bully  them  in a 
[01:23:00]  dishonest  way  the fact  is  no one  challenges  Asians  to the  fact  that  for years  I got  to pull  the corner  of my  eyes apart  to make  fun of  them  now  I can't  not because  it's not  funny no  more  but because  I just  can't  so now  we're just  in a world  of people  who can't  do  what they  really want  to do  that's the  thing about  dishonesty  is don't  pretend  that you  don't  want to  do it  and don't 
[01:23:30]  think it's  that way  just say  look I  can't do  it because  I'm going  to get  fired  I'd rather  deal with  that from  a white  person  than the  white people  I deal  with which  is  who me  I've never  said  look I  say to  everybody  all the  time  my closest  friends are  racist  all you  guys are  racial  not racist  but racial  and some  are racist  I mean  you Anthony  so  but I'm  the same  way  and I  think we  all love  each other  because we  can keep 
[01:24:00]  that resentment  from building  in a real  place  I think we  have more  common ground  than a lot  of other  people  and it's  like I  always say  about race  there's no  issue between  the races  that can't  be fixed  with a smile  let's let  Patrice go  Patrice  thank you  sir  thanks a lot  Patrice  bye  you got  anything  going on  that you  need  plugged  though  he's  gone  we'll get 
[01:24:30]  a nice  time  Sarah  in Jersey  we're gonna  move on  we do have  a chimp  owner update  oh good  we're gonna  move on  to some  other things  happening in  the world  but first  before the  break  she admitted  that teabagged her  the post is  playing it up  like a love  story  like a love  story  post is hinting  that it might  have been a  little  bestiality  they're hinting  at bestiality  and not very  subtly  right  Sarah what  do you got  hey guys how's it  going  good evening  hi  gentlemen  I'm a teacher  in North  right 
[01:25:00]  oh wow  so I teach  I teach  high school  English  and I taught  a book  all right  called  senses  which is  about a  black man  in Philadelphia  and they  use the word  a lot  yep  that's how  people were  referred it was  from the 30s  and the 40s  that's when the  book takes  place  they refer to  each other  that way  so I teach  oh god  sorry  I'm in school 
[01:25:30]  all white  people report  to a small  room  lockdown  lockdown  return  yourselves  that's a code  blue  so my kids  read this book  and they're like  we're not going  to say this  we can't say  this because  that's racist  this guy's racist  I'm like wait a  minute guys  you turn around  and say that  word 15 times  passing in the  hallway  that's not racist 
[01:26:00]  and they're like  well it's because  it's with an A  not an E-R  and you know  they had difficulty  even saying the  word  reading the book  out loud  when the play  was written  by a black  man  about a black  man  in a time  period  so I don't  know  I hope that  that helped  open up their  eyes  to see  like how  hypocritical  that is  but  not entirely  sure  that they  all got it  I like  when I can  watch like  a Quentin Tarantino  movie  you watch  Pulp Fiction  Reservoir Dogs  things like that  and you just see  the way people 
[01:26:30]  talk or would  talk in those  situations  it's so honest  and natural  that's what makes  those movies so  cool to watch  is the dialogue  and when they  cut things out  like that  and you're watching  a situation  where you go  you know  he would use  this word  or he would  say this  or he would  treat this guy  like this  and they don't  for the sake  of political  correctness  so they don't  offend somebody  it's crap  speaking of that  you saw  Gran Torino  recently  and we had  a discussion  why didn't 
[01:27:00]  Clint Eastwood  use the n-word  drop the n-bomb  because he was  really an old  racist  that was all  you know  a lot of  people are  saying  what was  your take  on that  he wouldn't  have used  the word  and he did  use the word  spook  when he was  addressing  some black  gentlemen  that were  about to  which was  a great  scene  that was  a hilarious  scene  treat an  Asian girl  improperly  but I do  think he did  it to keep  away from  I think they  wanted to make 
[01:27:30]  this guy  a little  likable  and I think  if that early  in the movie  he would have  dropped the n-bomb  it would have  been very hard  for him to  become this  kind of  ignorant  but likable  character  where at the  end then  when it culminates  in the ending  you really do  feel for him  and I think  if he would have  done that at the  beginning  I think  they were  more afraid  it might have  tainted  this later  that's a really  good point  actually  because the  other words  he used  for the  black man 
[01:28:00]  in the movie  kind of made  him look like  oh that silly  white man  that silly  old white  racist  he used  old white  curmudgeon  words  it wasn't  like hardcore  racist words  you could tell  that he probably  in the war  had worked  next to  and respected  black men  but you know  these street  punks  he had no  use for  I was  really pissed  off when I  found out  that he  wasn't using  the word  before I  saw the  movie  and then  I kind  of felt  like okay  it kind  of makes  sense  and now  you really  hammered the 
[01:28:30]  point  I didn't  see it  can I ask  you because  I didn't  see it  was it  more like  was he  kind of  like playing  more of a  bigot than  a hardcore  like Archie  Bunker  was a bigot  he wasn't  dropping  n-bombs  hatefully  he just  said stupid  crap  because he  was kind  of an  ill-informed  boob  of a guy  that's kind  of what it  was he  had obviously  problems with  Asians because  of the war  he was in  the Korean  war  problems with  everyone  and he had  problems with  everybody  his own  family  he hated  everybody  but it was  old school  kind of  old man  you know  fired from  his job  after so many 
[01:29:00]  years  or retired  whatever it  was  and he  played that  very well  but he also  it wasn't  this stereotypical  closed minded  kind of guy  like I  hate  I'm a racist  and F you  he was very  open minded  to somebody  if somebody  treated him  nicely  he would  treat them  nicely  he'd give  him hell  but that was  his way  like one  of his  best friends  at the  barbershop  he'd come  in and  they would  do nothing  but trade  Italian  and whatever  he was  Polish  Italian and  Polish jokes 
[01:29:30]  back and forth  but you could  tell they  loved each  other  I say it  all the time  the older  generation  that's what  they did  my dad  at the hall  the VW  what is it  I always mess  it up  VFW  the VFW  hall  I always  say that  it was just  like that  scene in  Gran Torino  they're just  sitting there  making fun  of each  other's  nationality  and they're  all totally  cool with it  the Italian  getting beat  up  the black  guy  getting beat  up  the Polish  guy  getting more  beat up  usually  when I  was there  the Irish  guy 
[01:30:00]  and they  just threw  the ball  around  and had  a lot  of fun  with it  no one  got hurt  in the end  well guys  thank you  Sarah  Sarah  had to go  to class  it's like  I always  say publicly  whenever racial  stuff comes up  and someone  says something  a little rude  I'll always go  we don't need  to do that  do we  I mean  I'm on the  record  speaking of  racist  Adam Farrar  is here  dude  I absolutely  wanted to say  the same thing  he probably  has one of  the most  offensive  stage act  time  it's  unbelievable  so Adam's 
[01:30:30]  going to join  the program  next  also  Doug Benson  later on  we've never  had him  on the show  very funny  guy  and a good  pal of ours  Jim Jeffries  calling in  he needs  a little  help  from the  ONA listeners  Jim's taping  an HBO special  I guess  his website  is Jim  Jeffries  dot com  is a way  to get  tickets  through that  we'll talk  to Jim  it's been a while  he's great  he's great  he really is  Opie and Anthony  stay there  Opie and Anthony  Anthony's pal is here 
[01:31:00]  Adam Farrar  and your pal  Opie  I know  but you guys  go way back  I've only known  you for 14 years  that's true  you've known  Anthony for well  over 20  and I don't  panda  and I don't  crumble  I just drive  a school bus  we got it  I know you gotta  keep repeating  repeating  you're either  trying to  convince yourself  or you're drunk  I hope an  abutment's in  his future  an abutment  give me liberty  or give me  debt  we got you  simmer down 
[01:31:30]  I don't think  you've heard me  I said  getting recognized  from Mall Cop  we asked you  last time  but now it's been  another couple weeks  with that movie  once in a while  once in a while  come on  it's a lot of kids  it's a kids movie  so like  I'll walk  and Rescue Me  I was just talking  to someone yesterday  and they said  that your part  in Rescue Me  is pretty big  Dennis Leary  finally doing  the right thing  giving Adam  a lot of attention  yeah it's nice 
[01:32:00]  he took care of me  it's a really good season  and we come back  I think April 7th  we do the Rescue Me  tour comes to New York  for Radio City  April 2nd  which is a great concept  it's you  Dennis Leary  it's Lenny Clark  Dennis' band  the Enablers  and you're going to  show some Rescue Me  they're going to  show the first episode  and all the proceeds  go to Benefit 9-11  the Relief Fighters  Fight of Fun  which is going to be  at Radio City  April 2nd  you know what  I'm a huge Rescue Me 
[01:32:30]  fan and I almost forgot  about the show  we're back  how long has it been  off the air  I think it was  right before the  writer's strike  it usually was  a summer series  that's a year ago  right  but we got 22 episodes  and we'll come back  and we're all shot  already  we're on the last four  cool  no spots for certain  people  I would love to  play a victim  you want to play  a victim  I don't care  I'll come out  of the building  going  oh good one  I want you to  play a victim  with me  because I play  the chief  so I don't get  to go in  to the buildings  I'm like my mother  talking to the lawn 
[01:33:00]  guys  just pointing  you go over there  so I want you  to be outside  with me  but I'm with  Jimmy too  because we have  Dennis out  all the time  I go  Dennis I'm not  even asking for any  I just want to walk  be a pedestrian  walking by  I think I could  do that for you  I'm not even  raising my expectations  I just want to  be in the background  I tell you  it's boring  I'm in the background  I'm in the background  I would probably  do that wrong  you're right  I got this part  because Mr. J. Whiteside  thinks a great deal  of me personally  Mr. J. Whiteside 
[01:33:30]  I want to be a mayor  on this damn show  I can bumble  and knock things  off tables  I'm a bumbling mayor  no I mean blind  and just look  in the wrong direction  I'm not a governor  oh  no no  I meant to do that  see  guy who makes errors  that's my character  I rescue me  I'm the know-it-all  guy who makes mistakes  car crash victim  I'll take that  whatever  that's funny  I actually pulled out 
[01:34:00]  of my own joke  with the jaws of life  I wanted to know  what happened there  this person also  yesterday  talking about  rescue me  he said  one of the characters  is all about  9-11 conspiracy theories  right  yeah  you're going to  explore that  on rescue me  yeah  like he completely  believes it's an  inside job  and Dennis doesn't  right  no  okay  so there's the  conflict  as you go back  and forth  alright  thank god  no  because I was like  what is Dennis  losing his mind  he's going down  that conspiracy road  but what happened 
[01:34:30]  with one of the  characters  that's kind of cool  yeah  that's nice  and they really  went back to the  guys hanging out  just being guys  again this year  which is fun  oh cool  yeah  some of the  ridiculous stuff  that we lived  just any guys  hanging around  with guys  it's going to  go back to  girls and stupidity  do we get to see  Dennis Leary's  skinny white  Irish ass  that's always a lot  of fun when you  watch rescue me  I can say I was  never in an ass  team with Dennis  he's got the best  job  he picks the hottest  bras I've sex  with on his TV  show  it's good to be 
[01:35:00]  the king  you have that  simulated sex  where I don't  know how you  do that  right  I've never  had to do that  no you never  had to do the  old simulator  because apparently  they're naked  in bed  I guess they  wear  unless  I don't know  sometimes they're  showing like  pretty full shots  where I don't  know what they're  wearing  like a jock  strap or  something  or something  covering the  you know  the parts  but then they're  grinding on each  other  as an actor  and actress  and you'll  always hear him 
[01:35:30]  say  there are so  many people  in the room  and it's so  it's not romantic  at all  but let me tell  you something  you're naked  in bed  with some  little starlet  how do you  not  you know  get a little  excited  it's like  rubbing Ziggy's  nose against  a taco  that's what  it looks  like  all right  so rescue me  we're excited  and a lot  of episodes  too  yeah we got  22  and I'm 
[01:36:00]  at Gotham  tonight  through Sunday  all right  see you later  thank you for  shopping  please watch  the mail  for our  circular  hey you  follow this  chimp story  in Stanford  I saw  the cartoon  I saw  the  no  well  is she  sleeping  with the  monkey  well  it looks  like  that's  what the  paper is  kind of  hinting at  today  that she  was a little  creepy  how were they  hinting at it  hinting by doing  the exact same  thing like  you do with a  girl  you apply it 
[01:36:30]  with a little  bit of wine  you maybe  drop a Xanax  into her  and you take  her to bed  that's exactly  what she was  doing with this  chimp  and you know  what they are  married  look at the  ridiculous sweater  she made him  wear  front page  the happy  couple  bizarre love  of gal  and ape  yeah they  shared wine  they bathed  together  yeah they  took baths  together  yeah  that must  have been  great  harmless  that's creepy  harmless  who hasn't  rubbed the  I put bananas 
[01:37:00]  in my crotch  to get what I  wanted  who hasn't  not in an  ongoing  relationship  that was just  a timed  experience  these two  were together  like for a  long long  time  she's a  widow  so uh  you know  the hubby's  out of the  picture  she was  probably a  little lonely  you know  they look  happy but  the chimp  had an  ashley  madison  account  oh damn  poor  poor gal  yeah  hey uh  here's a quote  from uh  chimp lady  he slept with  me every  night  every night  he combed  my hair 
[01:37:30]  see  everything in  the house  is for him  she fed  she fed him  filet mignon  and lobsters  tails  and friends  faces  yeah right  have  dolores's  jaw  it's  wonderful  on me  i didn't  know that's  what he  meant by a  threesome  they shared  cozy glasses  of wine  they bathed  and slept  together  see they  make it  sound very  bestiality  like  she gave  him gifts  and sweet  kisses  he drew  her pictures  really  drew her  pictures  it's a 
[01:38:00]  monkey  what's he  gonna draw  just like  banana after  banana picture  on the  refrigerator  little magnets  it continues  it's just  weird  one friend  said  it's an  animal  not a  person  what she  had with  that monkey  was not  normal  that's a  friend  well yeah  because she's  scared that he  ate the last  friend  how embarrassing  is it when you  go to hand  something a  tickle me  Elmo  and it  rips your  jaw off  it just  annihilates  your face  oh 
[01:38:30]  and after she  stabbed him  look at the  stupid monkey  it said  something  very offensive  to the  chimp  there was  and the  friend that  got eaten  she was just  stupid  because she  showed up  with a new  hairdo  a different  car  and she's  waving this  Elmo stuffed  toy in front  of her face  so does that  mean no  stranger could  have just  pulled up  to her house  no  or this  thing would  have attacked  like oh  she looked  different  well what if  somebody pulls  up and goes  you know I'll  ask directions 
[01:39:00]  over here  this lady  look everyone  had that  dog you had  to put in  another room  oh yeah  watch out  it nips  it nips  it's not a  it bites  bites you  when we had  Mikey the  chimp in  Mikey was  adorable  of course he  was but  we all  were thinking  you were  watching him  closely  because you  don't trust  him  you think  he could  snap at  any moment  if he did  the wrong  thing  because he  was so  little  and his  little hands  you grab  your hand  and look  at you  with those 
[01:39:30]  eyes  you see  how strong  he was  that little  thing  he was  built like  a brick  house  I swear  to you  that you  pat him  on the  back  and it  was like  a bag  take a  bag of  concrete  you know  those bags  of concrete  and stuff  and pat  that  that's  what his  back felt  like  it was  like  concrete  and picture  that at  200 pounds  jumping on  you and  ripping your  face off  because Mikey  was a smaller  chimp  he wasn't that  big  he was feeding  me water  he would hold  my head  and hold 
[01:40:00]  the water  and then he  would drink  out of the  water bottle  which was  really disgusting  I know  but I didn't  want him to  be mad at  me and rip  my jaw  off  share my  water  stupid  your genitals  are gone  how long  was she  with this  because she  had this  like  commercials  and stuff  so she  had it  13 years  in chimp  years  or human  years  the same  year  like Ann  said  the chimp  was a couple  months old  right to the end  and ended up  sleeping with it  yeah she lost 
[01:40:30]  her husband  and her daughter  so this  kind of  took the  daughter  died in a  car accident  the husband  died  the chimp  was driving  and the chimp  was drunk  and the chimp  killed the husband  in an insurance  scam  someone took  out a life  policy  I almost  said 500  thousand bananas  if the husband  dies  I'm like  how many  that's good  that's funny  I know but how  many banana jokes  can I do in the  same one  I have one angle  on it  because it only  gives motive  to the chimp  he was strangled  but there was 
[01:41:00]  literal  the husband  was strangled  but there was  no thumb  print  he's got a  thumb  an opposable  thumb  sure  that's what  makes  that's why  she slept  with him  he's got  a thumb  on his  foot  he's got a  thumb on his  foot  one in the  one in the  stink  yeah he did  his fonzie  impression  well that's  one in the  stink  one in the  pink  one in each  ear  honey we're  gonna play  hitchhiker  he could do  a little fonzie  with his feet  she used to  love that he'd  go hey  hey with his  big toe  yeah  then he'd poke  her dumb eye  and sit on  his ears 
[01:41:30]  is that mikey  is that the  picture of mikey  look at little  mikey  he's wearing  red pants  he looks like  one of the  four tops  yes  he's dressed  up in the  red  and he's got  a little red  bow tie  and he's  holding some  playing cards  i'm sure he's  happy to be  dressed like that  yeah he's gonna  kill him  yeah exactly  that's probably  what happened  she was out  shopping he  found all the  ridiculous pictures  that she took  of him and he  just snapped  you know what the  most horrific  part of the  story is and we  talked about it  yesterday but  this monkey  this chimpanzee 
[01:42:00]  actually it's an  ape from the  ape family  not the monkey  family  so it's actually  not right calling  him a monkey  i'm sorry dr  yes thank you  it had used the  keys it knew how  to get into the  car it once  started the car  and drove away  which is probably  better than me on  some saturday night  home from fh  riley's  hey we don't  over serve at  fh riley's  of course you  don't  i don't know  what the hell  you do before  you get there  i go around  like spalding  and just empty  people's drinks  yeah but you 
[01:42:30]  have the option  drinks off the  bar  the option of  driving home  not swinging  from the trees  to get home  yes whatever  yes  how cute is  mike but uh  mikey is adorable  mikey's gonna rip  someone's jaw off  eventually  i have no doubt  you think mikey's  gonna do that  oh my god  these chimps  they want to be  in the wild  i think we know  best but we don't  i think this woman  i'm surprised there  was an incident on  the lancelot link  set  yes i did a  lancelot link joke  the other day  and i got that  response  really it's just  no one knows it 
[01:43:00]  someone out there  nothing  someone out there  loved this  lancelot link  about  lancelot link's  secret chimp  i didn't see that  he was like a  secret agent  chimp  but it was all  monkeys  the whole cast  was monkeys  and what they  would do is like  give them  chewing gum  so they would  do this with  their mouths  and their mouths  would move  and they'd dub  in the words  yeah  and matahari  yeah matahari  was his like  girlfriend  yeah  and he'd be like  hey matahari  he got a hat  we gotta go  yeah he wore like 
[01:43:30]  a sam spade  kind of hat  oh am i gonna get  in trouble  he you know  wore the hat  and everything  they did look  who's talking  before look  who's talking  man  right  they did with  monkeys  hot on the heels  of mr ed  can we get the  talking animals  hysterical  maybe we should  get a job  look baron  was the bad guy  right  with the monocle  with the monocle  how'd they keep  that  credo was the  chauffeur  the shifty  chauffeur  dragon woman  was very nasty  that was chump 
[01:44:00]  and uh  where's lance  the lot link  strange mind  doctor strange mind  yes strange mind  was uh  all chimps by the way  i want to see  what these chimps  ended up doing  later in life  by the way  wang fu  dressed up like  an asian  and the duchess  oh it's probably  the same monkey  you boo  i bet it is  i bet they have  two monkeys  yeah  lance the lot link  secret chimp  and where's lance  though  did they show lance  he's probably got  lance  lance  lance  lance  lance 
[01:44:30]  is the lance  lancelot link  secret chimp  hour  oh jeez  you think a half  hour of a talking  chimp is enough  can we get some  of these clips  for for the show  you know what  i bet  i i would  i would get that  woman that just  had that horrible  uh mauling  the other day, the box set of  Lancelot Lake's Secret Chimp, as like  a joke. See if she has got a sense  of humor. Let's send her pride with the apes.  They're talking, the chimp is talking on the  telephone with her feet soaking  in. She had a hard day.  She's getting a little pedicure.  Another chimp is on a boat. 
[01:45:00]  It's running a sailboat.  It's insanity. How does that work?  They nail  the chimp to the chairs.  Look, see, they make them go  with their mouths, and then they dub in  the words. Look, they're acting.  How do you direct chimp?  The chimp has to  walk in and say, cut, take  14,501.  Stop throwing doo-doo at your  co-star.  You know what? This would be a nightmare.  That's awful. 
[01:45:30]  You gotta staple the hat to its  little soft monkey head.  One episode took five years to film.  Some of the best parts of this  stupid show, though, was the fact that  things would just happen,  and they would just make a story around  it. Like, they'd get two chimps dressed  up in these outfits to interact with  each other, and then come up with a  story later, after it's all filmed,  by dubbing in the dialogue.  I gotta watch this now.  Yeah, you should watch an episode.  They found a ten-minute clip online, so  where is that for the people? We'll link it 
[01:46:00]  on onaradio.com.  Yeah, just put in Lancelot link on YouTube.  You'll find it.  Alright, hey, so we got more audio of the  chimp lady here. There's a quote, we  couldn't find the audio, where she said,  until you've eaten with a chimp, bathed  with a chimp, you don't know a chimp.  Oh, here's what I want to say earlier.  This woman obviously isn't a trainer.  She doesn't know, like, to discipline  these animals like I think a trainer  would, to know how to keep them in check,  because you do have to be the master of 
[01:46:30]  a wild animal. They have to look at you  as the alpha. And I think  this woman was  this chimp's girl.  And when this other woman  comes up or something, it was just one of those  things where maybe he was trying to protect  his territory.  That's what she's saying now.  But normally that wouldn't happen  if you're the alpha  in the relationship.  But it doesn't happen,  and trainers tend to do that.  If you own an exotic animal,  you gotta zap it. 
[01:47:00]  Right, you need a cattle prod.  You gotta cattle prod it from time to time  to show who's boss.  I'm sure Pete is very happy to hear this,  but it's the truth.  For no reason, Roy.  You gotta head training, too.  You gotta cattle prod it every once in a while.  Show him who's boss.  I think the chimp, the woman he killed,  he was having an affair with him.  He was afraid the chick was going to talk,  so he whacked her.  Yep.  He couldn't have it.  The way to alpha a chimp, to be honest,  is to train.  I'm not a trainer, but the way to do it  is the chimp is acting up.  You have to go,  behave!  And does that work? 
[01:47:30]  All the time.  Every single time.  And you also have to reward a chimp  for good behavior.  That's right.  I'd like to kiss you,  but you're so damn ugly.  You just give him a good one of these.  Atta boy!  And you give him the old chin punch.  You scrape the hair off of your face.  Why?  Only kids your age have beards where I'm from.  Yes, then.  I need some positive.  Go ahead, ride the tricycle.  You know what, we gotta take a break,  so we'll have the latest chimp lady audio  after the break. 
[01:48:00]  Adam Farrar, you got it.  Adam's clapping like a monkey  where they clap on the back of their hands.  What are we pushing today?  Gotham?  Gotham, tonight through Sunday.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Adam Farrar.  Gotham.  Tone my hair, you pretty monkey.  Pick the nits out of my hair, please.  Eat my fleas if you love me.  Oh, she probably did do that grooming thing  to it and everything.  She was that chimp's bitch. 
[01:48:30]  That's what she was.  She started out as a chimp's mother.  She adopted the chimp.  And then there was some weird...  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow.  That was in the bathroom.  Oh, it followed you out.  It came out.  I dropped out of the bathroom.  That little rascal, you know what it is?  It was hanging out.  It was tugging on my shirt,  and I was like, stay in here.  What are we having gas there?  It came out and attacked my face like Travis.  It kept tugging on my shirt,  and I was like, what are you doing?  Oh.  Good.  My girl's going to Philly,  so maybe we do gas day tomorrow.  Because I've got to prepare for gas day, 
[01:49:00]  and I don't want to be more embarrassed  than I am already.  Yeah.  With my gas issue.  You have a gas issue?  I think I eat too much protein, Adam.  I farted on a tonight show.  Did you really?  Yeah.  I was in the middle of my set,  and I didn't want to,  but I got an applause break,  and I said, I better do this now.  So while the people were clapping,  so nobody heard it,  and then I cut the last joke  before it reached Kevin  and went over to the camera.  Is it obvious that you got it?  No, no, you can't.  Oh, that's too bad.  That would be hilarious. 
[01:49:30]  I think Jay would have appreciated that.  I didn't.  All right, this is what the chimp lady's saying today.  Man, she can't keep her mouth shut.  She's just yip, yip, yip.  Yeah, she really went right to the press  real quick, didn't she?  Hmm.  Yeah.  By the way, Stephen S. from Bayshore,  I guess there's a bunch of people  getting together at FH Riley's this weekend.  I don't know if I'm going to make it.  I hear tell.  What is it all about?  Stephen S. has been hitting me up on Twitter  a lot about this thing. 
[01:50:00]  I don't know.  Some birthday party or something?  I think I'm going.  You're going?  Yeah.  You know the person that's throwing the whole thing?  I know the person that owns FH Riley's.  That's all I got to know.  Holla.  Holla.  400 New York Avenue.  When is the big shindig with the fans?  Saturday?  It's a Saturday.  Saturday, okay.  I hope we don't go in there  and there's another goddamn private party.  I heard about that.  We go there and the place is like,  there's no one in there.  I'm like, oh boy, business must be oof.  Jesus, it's a good thing we're here  to maybe grab a couple of Guinness or something. 
[01:50:30]  I sit at the bar.  It's like, private party coming in  in like a half hour.  I'm like, fine, I'll take my business elsewhere.  Harumph, harumph.  Harumph, harumph.  I didn't get a harumph out of that guy.  Harumph.  You watch your ass.  But F.H. Riley's Huntington Village this Saturday.  I guess everyone's getting together.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if I'm going to Philly  or going to Long Island.  Now I got to figure out  what I'm going to be doing here.  You know, you could go to the  Gotham Comedy Club in New York City.  I would.  True.  Tonight through Sunday.  That's the midground.  What time do you hit the stage there, Adam?  I think the show starts at 8 tonight.  Well, what time you hit the stage? 
[01:51:00]  I think 8.  45, maybe 9 o'clock.  Maybe I'll go see Adam tonight.  I love your comedy.  Thank you.  I love your stand-up.  Calm down, my friend.  Hey, by the way, we got...  Saturday, I think we're all from F.H.  Back to my place for big movie night.  I saw the pictures, my God.  Oh, yeah.  The theater should be up and running.  Ready to go.  Wow.  I missed Lost by one day.  I want to see Lost on an 11-foot screen.  That's great.  That'll be...  He got a movie theater in his basement, and I got a new app for my iPhone. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, that's good, too.  That's nice.  I got the big keyboard for emails.  Oh, you got that one?  Yeah, I got that one, too.  What's that one?  I don't have that app.  You can get a big keyboard to type emails?  Oh, pretty much self-explanatory.  Oh, let me see that thing.  Let me see that.  You know the big keyboard of a mail app.  Come on, Jimmy.  Ride the bike.  Let me see that, Adam.  What are you, 70 years old?  Why do you need that?  Why do you need the big keyboard?  I got thumbs like bananas.  Let me see how big they are.  Go to the...  Iroh's glasses from Casino.  Where is the damn keyboard? 
[01:52:00]  You know, there's an app now that they're very controversial, the card-counting app.  I heard about that.  They made a card-counting app that Casino's a little upset at.  Big, giant keyboard, yeah.  Just turn it sideways and speed.  That's big enough.  By the way...  But, yeah, they made a card-counting app.  I heard about that.  You know, but if you're pulling out...  I think they got a camera, too, in the casinos.  Call me silly, but I think they're watching you.  Yeah.  I'm just sending a text.  And card-counting, though, it isn't illegal.  It is illegal to use a machine or any type of device to do card-counting. 
[01:52:30]  Then it's a felony.  You know why it's not illegal?  They encourage card-counting because they think a lot of people know what the F they're doing with the card-counting.  Most of the time.  And they end up losing more money.  And the casino knows that.  If you're the guys that are good at it, they do reserve the right to remove anybody from their premises.  Of course.  You're removed.  Of course.  For any reason.  But they're hoping more people are trying the card-counting thing.  Yeah, try the card-count.  We'll beat you anyway.  Because they're messing it up big time.  What is there, six decks in a shoe?  Yeah.  You're not getting...  And now it's a continuous...  They have these continuous shuffle shoes. 
[01:53:00]  You ever see those?  Oh, shuffle shoes.  They work like the poker...  Sounds like something you wear in the loony bin.  My shuffle shoes.  My shuffle shoes are tied together.  You can only go so far.  They reshuffle the deck every time.  They reshuffle like six decks.  How about you give us a break?  The odds are so against us to begin with.  Stop.  It's called just getting lucky.  Unless you're playing poker where there is some skill and...  And you're playing against other people, not the house.  Yeah.  But if you're playing games of chance, that's why they call them games of chance. 
[01:53:30]  You need a little luck on your side.  I'm going to go back to that page for two seconds.  We want to buy a building.  What?  I want to buy a building.  You want to buy a building?  Yeah, we're going to buy a building.  Okay.  You're trumping my movie theater.  Yeah, right?  I'm going to buy the Statue of Liberty.  You do make people...  I want an aircraft carrier.  Yes.  Damn it.  After seeing your movie theater, I did go back to my place going,  all right, what can I do?  What can I do?  I want to jazz this place up.  But I don't have as much room as Ant does. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, that's city living.  It sucks.  No, I want to buy a building.  It's a two-minute drive with Kenny to work,  which must be nice.  A brownstone or like a commercial?  No, for the restaurant.  Oh.  It makes business...  It's good for business.  Still in Huntington, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  We want to own our own building now.  I got a feeling this is the time to buy.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's why I'm kind of throwing that out there.  And you want a restaurant in Huntington?  We got the restaurant in Huntington.  And it does very well.  But the next step is to own the building. 
[01:54:30]  Expand, maybe, too?  A little bit bigger?  I think we can handle that.  A couple more tables.  My brother rules.  He rules the restaurant business.  He's doing unbelievable.  He does well.  I mean, the fans go there,  but the word on the street is his food is amazing,  and that's why the people are going there.  Yeah.  Good.  There's two inside.  Let's do chimp audio.  I think you might be able to get this guy I know,  Paulie, to come in and partners with him.  Sure.  And not Uncle Paul.  It's a shame.  You light a match. 
[01:55:00]  Then you light a match.  I mean, you know, I'm not Opie.  He's a pig in a silk hat.  I mean no disrespect.  I know he's your friend.  You want me to shoot him?  That's not a bad idea.  You see the look he gives him?  Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But you've got to do something about this guy.  He's crazy.  This is what the chimp lady is saying before we get out of here.  I'm so concerned about her and the loss of him.  And then some people giving these calls like I would have rot in hell for killing him.  I mean, here's something that was like my son. 
[01:55:30]  There's my best friend.  Retarded son.  It was in seconds, minutes.  What do you do?  You know?  Sit in the car?  That I killed him.  Not help your friend?  Hide?  Hide?  I did whatever I had to do at the time.  They did for 12 minutes.  She was being ripped apart by a wild animal.  You're surfing the radio.  You know how long 12 minutes is?  That woman, from the time the attack started until it ended, 12 minutes. 
[01:56:00]  I wouldn't want to be in that situation for 12 seconds.  No!  And the chimp wasn't taking breaks.  No, no.  It wasn't like, oh, I'm exhausted.  This lady's face is tough as nails.  Anyone else notice that she's starting to resemble a chimp herself?  You know how, like, these dog owners, they start looking like they're dogs?  She was starting to look like a chimp.  Did you see that furry thing she was wearing yesterday?  It looked like the chimp's fur.  You know she wears that or wore that, too, because the chimp probably picked at it and 
[01:56:30]  did stupid chimp things with it.  And that was, I'll tell you something about chimpanzees.  Once they get old, they're just mangy looking.  Not as hot.  Not hot.  Oh, wait a minute.  What am I talking about?  Chimps.  Okay.  Sorry.  I got distracted there for a second.  A nice 20-year-old chimp.  You know, it was the most horrible thing that could have ever happened.  And nobody would know unless they were in my place.  And many, many people know the love that I had for Travis and Travis had for me. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, Travis.  For me to do something like that, put a knife in him, was like putting one in myself.  And then he turned around and like, Mom, what did you do?  I love people who say that, like putting a knife in myself.  Then why didn't you put a knife in yourself?  Put it in yourself.  And then it's to turn around like, Mom, what did you do?  Well, how about, son, you ate my friend's face.  It was more like, Mom, I'm trying to do this.  Doing something now. 
[01:57:30]  Mom.  She's not a bad lady, though.  She gave the thing.  She's crazy.  Maybe she's nuts, but she's not a bad lady.  No, but she's crazy.  You can't have a crazy lady owning an animal that can rip people's faces off.  It ate her face.  It took her eyeballs from her forehead.  It ripped her face off.  Her eyeballs, her nose, her lips, and her bottom jaw were torn off, along with like her hands and on her body. 
[01:58:00]  She had other, you know, wounds.  But he'd bite her legs, too?  The face.  She bit her.  She popped her arm off.  She ripped everything.  The chimp popped her arm off.  Ripped her arm off like a chicken wing.  And destroyed the Elmo doll.  Oh, yeah.  The Elmo doll, too.  You know that thing?  Where did she get the chimp, anyway?  Hey.  Yeah, where do you buy a chimp?  I don't know.  Would you want to live like that?  No.  What happened to that lady?  No.  No, we can't.  You mean, is that happening every day?  Do you know how uncomfortable that would be?  No. 
[01:58:30]  All that is missing off your body.  You're done.  Would you want to live?  Now you're blind.  You can't even chew.  You look like God only knows what.  Probably the worst thing that anyone's ever looked like.  Well, you're blind, so you don't know what people are seeing.  Yeah, but you're a bowl of stew.  That's it.  You're like eating a bowl.  Blind is blind.  This looks like pasta sauce.  That's it.  Mother, it's the minestrone lady.  We don't want to talk to her.  Mama, it's pasta fazool face lady.  You know how great kids are. 
[01:59:00]  If this lady begged to be killed, what do you think?  She would have to beg.  She could just say hello.  I'd do it.  Yeah.  Well, she's still in critical condition, but they said she's starting to kind of get a little better in some way, shape, or form.  Why not just give up your will to live?  I'm sure people are telling her, hang on.  You'll be okay.  And she's got no clue.  She probably has no clue of the extent of her injuries.  Her face is all bandaged up.  She's like, wow, these are thick bandages.  I can't see. 
[01:59:30]  Is she talking?  Boy, is she communicating?  No, this is me doing her head talking.  This is me in her head.  Oh, it's you.  After, like, first, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You know, when she finally gets a reasonable thought, it'll be like, oh, the bandages are tight.  And it's blocking out all the light.  Yeah, but it must have me in a dark room.  If this chimp went in through her forehead, there's brain damage.  She doesn't know what's going on.  Did he get through that bone?  Did he go in through the forehead?  He probably just ripped it.  He probably just ripped it.  Dug his nails into the forehead and ripped his skin down. 
[02:00:00]  Mouth just chewed at her face.  Like you just scrape out an avocado.  Yeah, yeah.  He, like, he peeled her face off and then ran it between his teeth like an artichoke leaf.  Yeah, artichoke is even better, right?  Sure.  Mmm, scrum diddly itches.  A little al dente.  You hope he didn't rip the arm off first so she couldn't defend herself.  I mean, that's got to be awful.  Like, that's going to help.  Some old 55-year-old woman arm, the chimp's going to go, all right, I give.  No, no, no, but I mean, if he pulls the arm off, that might be what they do. 
[02:00:30]  I don't know how chimp's thing.  And then just starts beating her with her own arm.  Yeah.  How degrading.  To an actual song.  Oh.  You know, like, puts on a Rush CD.  I am an ape, man.  You just don't want to live after that.  I don't think so.  The other clip, a lot of people are wondering, did you or did you not give the chimp some Xanax?  And this is what she has to say about that.  So nobody can know what I went through then and what I'm going through now.  It's horrible.  I mean, his blood going into his room where he was shot. 
[02:01:00]  Last night was when I, he's not in bed with me.  He slept with me every night.  He would comb my hair.  He has no face.  I mean, everything in the house is for him.  F the chimp.  Yeah.  Take down the tire swing and grieve.  It's a tragedy on both parts.  For my friend and for him and me.  I think your friend could give a flying F.  Yeah, he started.  About the chimp.  Right.  And she's all broken up that the chimp ain't in bed with her.  How about your face is gone? 
[02:01:30]  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Fun fact.  It was a murder meme Elmo.  Oh, is that it?  For him and me.  Had you given him the Xanax?  Never.  Never.  Never.  Never.  And it was a friend that was here.  He forgot it.  And it wasn't a prescription.  It wasn't anything.  He's never had anything.  So you've never given him anything?  Never.  Never, never, never, never.  And Sandy, what about you?  Never used a hot shot on him like some people do.  He's never had anything but love.  All this stuff you should have done, apparently. 
[02:02:00]  Use a hot shot on him.  Maybe let him live in a zoo.  Yeah.  You know, behind bars.  How about that?  That was one angry chimp.  Sure.  He didn't take any gunk.  And he probably was sick of that weak toy.  Like, bitch, it's my birthday.  Yeah, what are you bringing me?  I want to do that to my parents.  Never, they hand me a Van Heusen sweater.  Rip their faces off.  Yeah.  Just rip their arms and bite their jaws off.  That's funny.  All right, let's go to Tony on Long Island. 
[02:02:30]  Tony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Tony.  Jimmy, do you think the chimp ripped his fingers, brushed him gently over the woman's face?  I miss, I did, do I think he did what, his fingers, I heard?  Brush his fingers over a face.  It's an inside joke.  Oh, yeah, like face off.  That's funny.  Like the way Travolta did in face off.  Yeah, he probably did that.  He probably brushed him gently.  Wow.  Look at that.  Jenny found a great picture of a chimpanzee with its mouth open just showing his teeth. 
[02:03:00]  You don't realize that they don't have people teeth.  No, those are killer animal teeth.  Those are insane.  It looks like a saber-toothed tiger's mouth when that thing is open like that.  God, and they protrude out so they could just take chunks out of you.  And rip back.  And that's an eating face.  Oh, no, that's a picture of...  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  See how we do things?  I wouldn't want to be bit by that.  I wouldn't at all.  I get very frightened.  God, that is just a...  You know, they can look so nice and sweet and human-like.  How long did the chimp live with her?  Because there's got to be moments when that came out.  That face came out.  Maybe not directed at her, though.  Still, you see that face?  You see that face once.  That's it, I'm done.  You don't want anything to do with the chimp anymore.  Goodbye.  You need your own place, chimpy. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Time to move out.  Look, this relationship isn't working out.  Wow.  They're usually so happy-looking until they're eating your face and fingers.  And even then, they're smiling.  Baby chimps, adorable, in that little engineer outfit.  Where they put the little engineer hat and the suspenders, and like, they're going to drive a train.  They sit on the train.  They sit on the little train.  Smoke comes out.  Toot, toot, toot, toot.  And they smile and clap.  Wave.  That's hysterical.  Old, mangy chimp ripping off a friend's face? 
[02:04:30]  Not as cute.  Not as fun.  Call me silly.  Oh, look at that.  Teeth on that thing.  Hell no.  What do you do if that thing's biting you besides yell, ow?  That would, and the power behind those jaws and the neck muscles to then pull back the  meat that is being ripped out of your face.  One bite and her face could have been gone.  Oh, yeah.  One of those bites.  What would your move be?  To grab hold of the thing and hold tight?  Just to grab hold of it and try to make it feel good.  No, I'm serious.  What's the move?  That's what you do. 
[02:05:00]  Treat them like it's a prison shower and hope for the best.  Put them in some kind of bear hug and hope you're strong enough to hold them back a little bit.  I'd like to say, you're not going to outrun the thing.  Their panic reaction, the way they react, it's almost like you can't hurt it because  they don't do anything the way we do it.  They just flail and swing nails.  Yeah, you ever see them fighting each other?  You couldn't even, like, you might say, oh, go for the eyes.  Get them in the eyes.  The head is moving around and you can't even see where he is.  But you've got to do something, so what do you do? 
[02:05:30]  What do you do?  You die.  Yeah.  After the thought runs across, you're going, oh, my God, a chimp is,  eating my fet...  You're done.  You don't get the word face out.  My fet...  And they go for the eyes.  My fetta cheese?  What?  My Facebook account.  Let's go check out some video of chimps attacking.  There's got to be some video online.  Cool.  Let's see what it would look like.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Adam Farrar, Gotham.  Tonight, Thursday through Sunday. 
[02:06:00]  New York City.  New York City.  Rescue me.  Rescue me.  War Cops still happening.  War Cops still in theater, yeah.  Yes.  Look at you, man.  It's about time.  Adam Farrar.  It's about effing time for Adam Farrar.  I'm going to buy a building.  Throw and buy a building.  It's all by buildings.  Throw and buy buildings.  Start our own city.  I want my own building.  And a heliport so I can fly over...  You want to be the blind mayor, stupid?  I certainly do.  Oh, please.  I could do that for a week straight and not make up for my dumb mouse joke.  I know. 
[02:06:30]  What is this guy doing to the chimp?  He's trying to hold him back from biting his face off.  Come on, just nail him.  I love when the chimp wins.  You're just making him more eggs.  Oh, he's going for the foot.  See, they know where to bite.  This chimp isn't really giving it its all, though.  No, he's trying.  Oh, no, he's got his hiney.  He's climbing up on this gentleman.  He really wants that guy.  And some other gentleman's trying to get him off.  Look at that guy.  Where's the money? 
[02:07:00]  Where's the money?  He's wrapped around his leg and he's biting his ankle.  But this guy's calm.  He's like, come on, don't do that.  Dude, right there, I would have to be smashing him in the face with something.  Oh, yeah.  No, he got him off, though.  The trainer got him off.  Wow, that's pretty...  And then he just kind of goes away.  And everybody went away from the chimp.  Now he's sitting in a little chair.  His time out.  His hair's up, though, on the back of his neck and his back.  That's not a good sign, right?  Uh-uh.  Is this going to get worse?  Because there's still a minute left of this video.  Halfway left. 
[02:07:30]  You ever watch these videos that go, okay.  But then you look like, uh-oh, this is another minute.  Why would there be another minute left of this video?  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, they would have cut the end off.  Right, right.  There's nothing.  They're in a chair.  Now he's got some Haagen-Dazs.  Now he's got some Haagen-Dazs and he's eating that.  His legs are crossed like he's waiting for a bus.  Person's face, some ice cream, whatever.  I was just hungry.  All right.  The video ends nicely.  He's just sitting there with some Haagen-Dazs.  We've got to get out of here.  All righty. 
[02:08:00]  Haagen-Dazs was a German tourist he ate.  Adam Farrar.  Gotham.  I'll be in Philadelphia, uh, Saturday night, uh, with Artie Lang, uh, LiveNation.com at  the, uh, Tower Theater if you want to go.  Big show.  Yes.  Cool.  Oh!  More show.  Oh, this is not as good as the last chip attacking video.  He's punching him, though.  He's, like, fighting him.  But then the guy goes there, there, and was able to calm him down, too.  In a fair fisticuff fight, he'll kick your ass. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, and then you've got to deal with that...  That big monkey ass.  Yeah, monkey butt that they got going for themselves.  You think they add insult to injury and just rub that monkey butt in your face?  That's how they do it.  They jump on you like that.  Yeah, this, uh...  He's jumping around like a maniac.  He's just pulling this guy like a rag doll.  They are so strong, those things.  Oh, boy.  This guy's just trying to get him off of him, and he's swinging him around in his arm.  It's not good the other chimps are, uh, helping out his pal.  Look at him just yanking him around.  This guy has no power to hold his ground. 
[02:09:00]  Nothing.  He's in the water.  He's jumped in the water, and now the chip, like, doesn't want to go in the water, maybe.  The other chimps are yelling,  It ain't worth it.  It ain't worth it.  Let him go.  He's tackled that guy, and this is a pretty, like, big guy, it looks like.  Sure.  He looks like one of these rugged, outdoorsy-type gentlemen.  I'm going to watch chimp attacking videos all day.  That's what I want to see now.  All day long.  Wasn't there one, wasn't there one, like, a reserve?  They went to give a chimp a birthday cake?  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  Now that guy is called...  That's our favorite story of all time.  Mr. Snap-on-nose guy.  Yeah, that guy.  He's all over TV.  Mr. Potato Head.  Now he's the expert on being attacked by a chimp and living.  He was all over the TV last night.  And one of the chimps got jealous and ripped him apart.  Yeah.  That must have scared that guy, thinking, if this chimp chases me into the drink, I'm  done for.  I'm done for.  Yeah, but again, the chimp, if you can grab it, there's a shot, you could drown it.  Even though he's much stronger than you, the chimp would probably have to worry about his  life, too. 
[02:10:00]  James Bond?  No, but I'm just saying, underwater, a chimp is not as effective underwater.  So you're saying you could beat up a chimp underwater.  No, but I think...  What about on Venus?  I think that it's a different...  If you're both rolling around, no matter what he's doing, if his head's underwater, he can't  breathe either.  Yeah, he's going to be all scared.  But if he's stronger than you...  He'd probably be frightened.  He'd be afraid, too.  I don't think they're fans of the water to begin with, though.  Well, that chimp didn't go in, unless the video just ended up.  No, he kind of stood on the bank there.  He shook his fist at him.  Well, okay, you...  Dammit, you got me this time with that water thing. 
[02:10:30]  I'm not going to find him in the water.  They don't like water.  Chimps don't like water, right?  Nope.  That's what they said on Planet of the Apes.  Nope.  I don't know.  What was that show on TV?  I watched it for a while.  They made a reality show out of chimps.  It was called...  Was it called Chimp Island?  Was it Chimp Island?  For real.  What was the name of the show?  Is it the video you're showing?  It's amazing what a little ding will do.  No, no.  I'm not sure what it was.  I'm actually talking about a real show.  I know you are, so am I. 
[02:11:00]  Believe me, I am.  What's the name of the show?  It was on.  And they gave all these chimps personalities and stuff.  It was like the real world with chimps on an island.  I don't care.  They didn't show it.  No, I remember the show you're talking about.  What was it called, Travis?  Coming to my rescue.  Was it Escape to Chimp Eden?  No.  On the National Geographic channel.  That sounds like it.  I don't know.  You fell for these chimps.  Every once in a while, one was...  That's exactly it.  You got emotionally attached.  No, I was thinking the other one, Danny. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was thinking that one.  Two different shows going on right now.  Yeah, of course.  But when we go to break, I'm going to pitch your mind.  It's the one you want to follow.  That's okay.  Yeah, just whatever.  There's two different things happening all the time, by the way.  Yes.  Let's get out of here and go over where we can say poopy.  All right.  Screw off.  We'll see you soon.  Later, man.  Opie and Anthony.  Adam Farrar. 
[02:12:00]  Who's coming in?  Doug?  Doug Benson.  Doug Benson's going to be here in about a half hour.  And our pal Jim Jeffries.  This might be him calling in right now.  He's going to call the show.  A call?  Why?  I'm insulted.  He's probably somewhere else.  Yeah, he's probably not in New York.  Meaning somewhere else in the world.  He's worldwide.  Busy, busy.  Mmm.  Mmm.  What about that?  That's him right there.  Mm-hmm.  That's the guy.  That's the guy right now. 
[02:12:30]  That's him.  That's the guy.  Just put him on hold.  You don't have to talk to him, Travis.  Thank you.  Hey, Jim.  How are you, buddy?  I'm good, Phil.  How are you, man?  We're good.  Am I on air?  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Oh, right, right, right.  Cool.  Am I allowed to swear or what?  Yes.  You're fucking bloody well, Ken.  That's right.  Oh, fucking nice.  That's brilliant, man.  I'm in Cleveland right now.  Cleveland.  Oh, Cleveland.  Yeah.  Do you guys still play in Cleveland?  Oh, thanks for bringing it up.  On satellite. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  I heard there's some problems.  I was saying to the people who ran the gig, I was saying, oh, I can advertise the gig,  and they said that you guys are, you know, the credit crunch.  The economy's fucked you up.  You're not allowed on the radio anymore.  Yeah.  They took us off in Cleveland because they made the good move of flipping, of removing all  the jocks.  They went jockless.  Yeah.  So they didn't have to pay anybody.  Well, I'm in a radio station now on their phone, and they've taken away the fucking water.  You can't have water anymore.  What?  Because they're saying it's not cost-effective to have water in the building. 
[02:13:30]  That's how bad radio's getting them.  They're taking away the water.  They're taking away the water.  They're saying, and next week, the coffee machine's going.  They said that.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  I went in, and I go, can I have a water?  They looked at me like, oh, there you go, your majesty.  You know, radio and coffee have always got, you know, going together.  Yeah, yeah, you'd think that.  But, you know, they can't break it because it needs water, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Damn, everyone's cutting back.  What's your cheap fucks? 
[02:14:00]  It's Obama.  I blame Obama.  Since he got in, everything's gone to hell.  Oh, it really has.  Everything was fine, and then he takes over, and look at the economy.  Oh, the stock market's down.  You can say what you want about George Bush.  We're at war.  He's had fucking water.  Yeah.  Bush just knew it was coming, man.  He got out in time.  Bail out.  Punch out Maverick.  He's sitting there thinking, you think I'm bad.  Wait till you see what happens next. 
[02:14:30]  Is it snowing over there?  No.  No, we just had rain or some crap.  Snowing in Cleveland?  It's snowing in Cleveland.  I see snow.  I've seen snow about four times in my life, and I'm like a child when it happens.  People think I'm retarded.  I run out and put my tongue out and dance around a bit.  A bit.  You make snow angels?  No, I think that would be a stupid thing to do.  You'd get cold.  Yeah, of course.  Lay down in the snow.  Like, what type of person would do that?  Well, Jews. 
[02:15:00]  I don't think Cleveland.  I guess if you're in love, you do a little snow angel thing, you think it's a good idea,  and then realize, this is stupid, and now we're all cold and wet.  I've never been in love.  I've never been so in love that I want my jeans to get wet.  Doesn't Cleveland just suck a knob, though?  There's like nothing going on there.  There's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Oh, so I've heard.  Oh, let's talk about this shithole.  Yeah, what do you think of it?  Did you go in?  Well, yeah, I know. 
[02:15:30]  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame rocks.  The thing that I find weird about Cleveland is that the buddy, the Cleveland Indians.  Right.  I know it sounds weird, but all this, the whole idea of calling a baseball team after a genocided  race of people is unbelievable to me.  There was never like a soccer team called the Munich Jews.  Jesus.  You know what I'm saying?  That's a good point, though.  The Sydney Aboriginal cricket team or something. 
[02:16:00]  I see it as an homage to a proud culture that has, you know, long gone.  As they take out fake tomahawks and go, oh, not in Atlanta.  They took all that away, and if this political correctness continues, you watch.  I bet you the Indians have to change the name of their F&D.  Cleveland, and you think of the Atlanta Braves, too, and all that shit.  The Washington Redskins.  Redskins are good.  That was the one.  That was like the Redskins. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  All these teams look the same to me.  Yeah, they're just nonsense.  They give them stupid names like Stars, something safe.  Yeah, when they got rid of Washington Bullets or whatever, for the Wizards or something.  Yeah, the Washington Bullets.  That was perfect.  Because it's violent bullets.  Right.  So they went with Grand Wizards.  What'd they go with?  I'm sure if you play for the Washington Wizards, you're not happy.  Yeah.  I know what this means.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We know what they really mean.  Right.  I can't believe they got rid of bullets because bullets are fast. 
[02:17:00]  Right.  That's all.  I think they're saying that we're going to go penetrate your body and spread your guts  out on the floor.  Right.  We're faster than you.  That's all it was.  We're faster than a speeding bullet kind of a thing.  Fast than a speeding bullet, yeah.  It's so violent.  And with crime running so rampant and the guns into...  Shut up.  So we correct the symbols instead of the problem.  Yeah.  The symbols of violence.  We take care of that, but not the actual problem.  So did that cut down on violence by changing the name?  Hell no.  You think that cut down on violence? 
[02:17:30]  We just realized that incidences are up 10%.  Yeah.  So, you know.  Stop it.  Call a fucking team like the Seattle Rapists.  That's what I want to hear.  And see if anything fucking happens.  I'd like to see their logo, though.  Yeah.  Just a woman's face with a big frown and a teardrop.  That's the cover of Yannan's new album.  Oh!  I want to see, like, a female police officer just talking to a woman.  That's the logo.  She's crying. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Handing someone a kit.  A lot of cotton swab day.  How far are we going to go with this?  I know.  Please.  Come on.  Hey, what gig are you doing in Cleveland?  I'm doing hilarities right through till Sunday.  Hilarities.  Hilarities.  Yeah, it sounds like a winner.  Yeah.  It's hilarious is kind of in the name.  I hate the names of these comedy clubs.  I really do.  They're awful.  There's not one good one out there as far as the names go.  It doesn't always have to be something funny, does it? 
[02:18:30]  Hilarities.  Does it always have to be something funny?  Right.  Yeah, why can't there just be one called Dave's?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  You can even put Comedy Club, you know?  Dave's Comedy Club.  But they got, like, ha-has and chuckles.  And it all blends together.  If you had a comedy club called Sadness, I'd check out the comedy club called Sadness.  Check out Depressions.  Right, right.  Let's go to Depressions.  I'll be playing at Depressions all weekend.  How about Larry's...  Now, that's a sense of humor. 
[02:19:00]  Larry's Miscarriage House.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah, you know, it wouldn't affect anything.  You get some name acts in there, you're going, eh, I'm going to fucking miscarriage.  And we get a little attention.  Yeah.  It's a stillborn Wednesday.  Yes.  Last time we saw you, we did that Halloween party together there, Jim Jeffries.  All right.  Well, that was all right.  That was the last time we saw you?  That's crazy.  Yeah.  I'll be back.  I'm going to be back in town in, like, I don't know.  I'm doing the HBO special on the 7th of March. 
[02:19:30]  March 7th.  Yeah, you want all the listeners to show up for the taping, right?  Yeah, free tickets for any O.P. Anthony fans who want to come.  So, we've got to get rid of, like, 1,400 tickets, so bring your friends along, you know?  This is in the same place as the Skirball Theater.  It's in the village here in New York on LaGuardia Place.  It's where I shot my half hour for HBO, if anyone went to that.  But it's a great facility at NYU.  It's a gorgeous theater.  It's free. 
[02:20:00]  The tickets are free, like they are with most specials.  If you want to get free tickets for this HBO special for Jim Jeffries, just email Jim Jeffries,  and that's J-E-F-F-R-I-E-S, at broadwayvideo.com.  And you have to give your phone number.  And, Jim, is there a link on your website?  There's a link on my MySpace.  My webpage is, I lost my computer, and I can't upload the thing, so it's dated back like two years ago.  But going to my MySpace, it's still working.  And there's a link on my MySpace. 
[02:20:30]  I think there's a link on Facebook as well.  So you lost your computer, wink, wink.  It must be over 18 to go.  That's the only requirement.  What was on the computer that you lost?  Yeah, really?  Did you have to lose it quick?  Yeah.  Did you lose it in a tub with a knock at the door happening?  Flight back from Thailand.  Make sure they don't do any scuba diving in that area.  Yeah, no.  You think you're safe, but damn.  Those things have a way of popping up.  Yes.  Ugly.  Quite ugly, yeah.  I just think that when you're looking at porn, though, whether, like, you're looking at 
[02:21:00]  some porn that's pretty out there going, is this illegal?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, bestiality stuff, I always wonder.  Like, eh, that's, you know.  Yeah, ones that always mention incest in it.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that illegal?  No.  Because we know they're not really father and daughter, but they've just said that in  the title to get your attention.  Yeah.  I think that's fine.  It has to be, dude.  Otherwise, if you're going to charge people with that, you'd have to charge people with  murder for playing murderers or, you know.  Yeah.  I think when you're, you know, you're dealing with little buds and a few wispy hairs, there 
[02:21:30]  could be a problem.  Right.  So the main rule is don't look at kids, right?  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  All right.  So that's fine.  So looking at donkeys...  Actually, I was talking about breast cancer patients.  What would be illegal about that?  Oh, shit, that's so bad.  Little buds and wispy hairs.  Oh, is that horrible?  I'm sorry.  Just waking up to the demograph.  I apologize to anybody without...  Hey, Jim, where's, uh...  How's your relationship with your mom?  It's all right.  Why?  Because every time I talk to you or you send me a text or something, you have a problem 
[02:22:00]  with mom.  Well, no, the last time what happened was when me and Patrice were on the radio and we questioned  whether I was gay because of snowballing and felching, right?  Right.  Every time on your show, I never think anyone else is going to hear it, right?  Because I'm in America and I feel like I'm safe.  And then some idiot puts it on YouTube and my mom just thinks I'm gay now.  She goes, disgusting, licking semen out of another woman's bottom. 
[02:22:30]  And how do you really...  You can't really just go to your mom, oh, I just make it up.  You know me and my imagination.  She doesn't even know what these words mean.  Right.  Oh, my God.  We're a little distracted, Jim, because there's...  I'm looking at some kind of horror nightmare show.  It's CNN.  It says an eye for an eye and they're showing a woman that has no eyes left.  Her face is all fucked up.  It's not that simple, Eddie.  And then why would you put glasses on your face so you don't have no eyes?  Why are there glasses? 
[02:23:00]  That is true.  No eyes.  I mean, why would you draw attention to the fact you have no eyes?  But they're like...  Her eyes were closed shut like...  They sewed the lids.  Like Neos in The Matrix when...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know the best.  Yeah, when he made his mouth fucking...  Right.  What if you couldn't...  So why were they sewn shut?  We don't know.  Because they're talking to you.  No, they're like a fucking melted shut or something.  It's like someone threw acid in her face or something or burnt her. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, we'll find out.  And where is she from?  Oh, they must have burnt her.  I see some charcoal.  Some savage nation where they cut women's heads off and...  I always think with burn victims, right?  Yeah.  Whenever they say, like in the news, someone's been burnt beyond recognition...  Mm-hmm.  The term burnt beyond recognition...  You ever seen a burn victim?  Mm-hmm.  They're the most recognizable people in the world.  Hey, you.  The guy with the surprise look.  Oh, look at that. 
[02:24:00]  Wow.  It looks like her face was melted.  I don't get it.  There's a layer of skin now over where her eye used to be.  It's not even her eyelids sewn shut.  It's just a whole new layer of skin.  What did she do wrong?  Iranian man, of course.  Woman he had been stalking.  Iranian man is to be blinded.  He's to be blinded.  Oh, did he blind her?  Yeah, I guess...  Oh, good.  He should be blinded.  An eye for an eye.  They do that over there. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  So he blinded her, so now he gets blinded.  He was stalking her.  He blinded her.  And good.  They should fucking blind him.  And now look what happens to you.  And now she's cutting up a pile of lettuce and newspapers, and she doesn't know where  one ends and the other one starts.  Oh, my God.  Her thumb is just dripping blood.  That's a brave woman.  They show her just, yeah, cutting up lettuce in her kitchen as she's feeling around for  the sharp objects.  I don't want to have dinner there.  This is a creepy video.  The camera crew left ten minutes ago.  She has no idea.  She looks like One-Eyed Willie at the end of the Goonies. 
[02:25:00]  Or I think she looks like those human mutants in Beneath the Planet of the Apes when they  take their masks off.  Yeah.  And the atom bomb there.  Well, an eye for an eye.  Good.  That was just on CNN there, Jim.  Oh, that's good.  It's like Slumdog Millionaire, isn't it?  Yes, on the fucking burning poker into that kid's eye.  That was a pretty good one.  That scene was crazy in Slumdog.  That movie has the tagline, the feel-good movie of the year. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Feel-good movie.  There's a kid blinded with a hot poker.  There's not even one happy bit.  He's probably all fucked up in the whole thing.  He's tortured.  There's kids being blinded.  There's children.  There's a hint of molestation going on.  Dude, they marketed that film horribly.  I thought it was a cute little independent film about this guy going on Jeopardy over  there, and that was it.  Yeah.  It turns out.  Jeopardy.  I mean, who wants to be a millionaire?  How depressing are their dark comedies? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, really.  I want to see one of their evil movies, if that's a feel-good movie of the year.  Wow.  You had no idea.  If no one told you about the movie, you're like, what the fuck did I get myself into?  It does seem to be a pretty despicable place.  Yeah.  It really just does.  That might be a feel-good movie.  Yeah, maybe that is.  Yeah, it's like death and customer service.  Yeah.  I think it was made by the British, that film.  They're claiming it anyway.  Not that they've ever gone over to India and just claimed something of their own. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, no.  Now they just claim it in movies.  It's great.  All those little kids in the film, they weren't paid.  They were just given, like, I don't know, something, some food or something, and they  weren't paid.  That's paid over there.  That's all they need is a spoil.  That's the problem.  Yeah, that's right.  What else do you want from us?  Fuck them.  Yeah, I mean, I think the guy who did Trainspotting did that.  The same guy who did Trainspotting directed that, and he was, he got a lot of shit because  he called them slum dogs.  They were really mad, you know. 
[02:27:00]  They were running around throwing, I guess they were cleaning up the place.  That's how they show protests.  They live in a dump.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  They're talking to the chimpanzee woman again?  Is that her?  Chimp attack victim is improving.  Oh, the chimp attack woman.  She lived through this.  The chimp who ripped the face off the other woman.  Yeah, that woman's alive.  That's fantastic.  No eyes, no face, no jaw, half an arm was ripped off. 
[02:27:30]  The chimp fucking ripped her face off.  Yeah.  And then started ripping open a police car's door, and the cop said, fuck this, and shot  it.  It then, you know, took three shots from a cop's gun, and then traipsed back inside  to its little cage where it went in to die.  And didn't it, wasn't it upset about an Elmo doll?  Yes.  Yeah, see, those things are dangerous.  Yeah.  You know, if you own a 200-pound chimp.  What was a grown woman holding an Elmo doll for? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, she was asking for it.  Yeah, because the grown woman living with the chimp is fine.  Yeah.  But the Elmo doll.  She was sleeping with that fucking thing, dude.  She really was.  She would have wine with it, a little surf and turf, some filet mignon, they would say,  and lobster tails, and then take baths together, and she would sleep with this thing.  You know she was fucking this.  You know that she let this chimp fuck her.  Aren't chimps vegetarians?  No, they'll eat anything. 
[02:28:30]  Gorillaz are vegetarians.  They're omnivores, I believe.  How are gorillas big, and they're vegetarians?  Gorillaz will eat meat, too.  How does that work?  They'll, like, eat the young of other fucking gorillas.  They're pretty nasty.  They look all cute when you put little suspenders and fucking an osh-kosh-pagosh little suit on it.  But when it's tearing your face off, I bet it doesn't look that cute.  Yeah, that's a big story, though, Jim.  We've had a lot of fun with that one.  Yeah.  Someone has to.  Yeah.  I only heard the phone call, like, late last night. 
[02:29:00]  That lady just crying.  She's ripping the face off.  Yeah.  Can you hurry?  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard the.  Can you hurry necessary at the end of.  Can you hurry?  Yeah, that pretty much goes without saying.  I think they're going as fast as they can.  They're not like, let's stop off for some tacos.  Right.  That's pretty funny.  It's okay.  Run the light.  There's someone sitting next to the burrito van going, well, he can't rip a face off twice.  Yeah, fuck it.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:29:30]  What are you going to do?  Put the nose back on?  She'll keep it.  I heard the police tapes from the actual dispatcher and police cars that were on their  way, and you could hear the confusion, and they didn't know if it was a chimp or an  orangutan, and then one of the cops, and he sounded pretty shooken up, just said, there's  a guy here with no face, and they couldn't even tell it was a woman at the point.  Maybe it ripped their tits off, too. 
[02:30:00]  Unbelievable.  Who knows?  A long time he was getting that close to looking with no jaw.  He wasn't feeling for a wreck.  Hey, Jim, why don't you come south and do our show tomorrow, man?  Um, well, I'm going to be over there a week, but do you want me to ring in again tomorrow?  Oh, no, I meant live.  All right, now I've got to come tomorrow.  That's Jim Pembrey.  That's Jim Pembrey, damn it.  That's Jim Pembrey.  You talk to him.  The chimp just puts the woman's face on his own face to go away.  Tries to walk away.  That's Jim Pembrey.  You talk to him. 
[02:30:30]  I hated Jim Pembrey.  Jim Pembrey was a douche.  He didn't want to talk to Jim Pembrey because he was a bore before he's been eaten by a  cannibal.  Jim Pembrey sucked a dick.  And he tells the first thing he tells him, hey, you look great.  Do I have my face cut off?  Hang in there, Jim Pembrey.  Last word the chimp said, not on the drawings, please.  And then the stupid cop with the big fucking Sam's dad mustache.  That's Jim Pembrey.  Right.  More info on that lady on CNN. 
[02:31:00]  It was an acid attack.  Really?  It took out her eyes and made her blind.  Threw acid in her face and melted her skin.  Melted her skin.  Yes.  That brings you to the question.  What do you want?  A chimpanzee ripping your skin off or acid in the face?  Good question.  Let's think.  Are those my only choices?  Acid in the face.  Can we throw a blowjob in there?  Yeah, something.  Acid in the face.  It's acid in the face.  That's obvious.  You'd have to go acid in the face.  It would still suck.  But the story's not as good at a party the next time, is it?  Yeah, how'd that happen? 
[02:31:30]  What party?  You lose the face.  Who's inviting you over?  Right.  How are you going to tell your story without a jaw?  You're the life of every party because you don't go without a lampshade on your head.  With two eye holes painted on it.  Watch this.  Unnecessary eye holes.  Dude, take off the glasses.  Take off the glasses.  It's the incident that you have off the acid.  The acid just speaks of you getting angry with your girlfriend.  Chimpanzee, there's a pity shag in that.  Ah, he might be right.  No, maybe one time.  No one pity fucks a man without a jaw or nose.  Right.  The hooker would be like the one that was being pushed toward the elephant man. 
[02:32:00]  Man.  You know how bad the elephant man's breath must have smelled?  Oh, God.  Those choppers.  Oh, damn.  That was the main concern.  The breath.  Yeah, not his big, giant, stupid molar head.  Giant plaque buildup in his head.  All those fucking nooks and crannies in his head.  How do you clean that out?  He didn't exactly live a good life.  He slept on hay and was beaten by an alcoholic.  My treasure.  That fucking show-off. 
[02:32:30]  The elephant man was a ham.  Fucking.  He would show off his one good leg.  What a bag of shit.  I'm glad he would shake this one.  I got bowling pin calves.  Yeah, look at the other one.  John Merrick was a fucking stage hog.  Fuck him.  Everyone had enough.  Anything else going on with you, Jim?  Nah, man.  Just gigging.  Just telling jokes.  All right.  You know, I wish I had something more exciting to tell you, to be honest with you.  Nah, it was a good call. 
[02:33:00]  I was good to have you on the phone.  Very good call.  We can't wait to see you live and come in and do the show.  All right.  Well, as I said, you guys know about all the tickets and people know what they've got to rig it for.  Well, no, not really.  Sort of.  This is exciting for Jim Jeffries.  He's doing an HBO special.  It's going to be taped March 7th, 7.30 and 10 o'clock at the...  How do you say that, Jimmy?  The NYU Skirball?  Skirball Center.  It's a great theater.  For those of you that came to my HBO half hour, it's in the village where we shot it. 
[02:33:30]  It's a great NYU facility.  It's a gorgeous new theater.  Right.  And you've got to be 18 or older, and the tickets are free.  So go email jimjeffries at broadwayvideo.com.  I've got to name it this week as well.  So if anyone's got any suggestions, the name of the buddy thing.  How about Jim Jeffries starring in the Jim Norton Has a Giant Cock Tour?  Yeah, that's better than what I've got.  About to you.  How about Faceless Chimp Bitch?  Monkey Business.  I think they call it the Bible, the Koran, and other books I haven't read. 
[02:34:00]  But it's a bit wordy.  Yeah.  Call it Mom, I'm Not Gay.  Yeah, like, that's funny.  Yeah, but no one's going to believe that.  Hey, Mom, I'm Not Gay.  Mom, I'm Not Gay.  You have to name it, huh?  Yeah.  We'll have a name for you.  Call it back tomorrow.  We'll have a good name for you.  Jim Jeffries.  You know, that's the whole thing about comedy specials.  You've got to name something.  None of them fucking mean anything.  Right.  Shameless and delirious and raw and all that type of crap.  None of them mean anything.  That's good.  Roar.  Shameless, delirious, and raw.  Jim, we've got creative listeners.  When they email for tickets, they might come up with one for you. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, that would be good.  All right.  For the tickets, jimjeffries at broadwayvideo.com.  Jim, we'll talk to you soon, all right?  All right.  I'll see you guys next week regardless, eh?  Yeah, have fun in Cleveland, all right?  All right, Jim.  Goodbye, Angel.  Thanks for having me.  There he goes.  We're going to continue in just a bit.  O.P. and Anthony.  Breaking the law.  Breaking the law.  Adam Farrar in studio.  He's playing Gotham tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Very, very funny.  And Sunday, too.  Good friend of the show.  Oh, and Sunday, too. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Come down after service.  Still haven't seen Mall Cop.  Last time you were here, two, three weeks ago, I said, you know what?  I got to support Adam and go see Mall Cop.  Still haven't seen it.  Waiting for the bootlegs.  Still in theaters?  You know, I'll get my bootleg.  Oh, yeah.  You can buy it off a card table at St. Mark's place.  But I'll give you the money.  I'll just give you the $12, whatever it is, for a movie ticket.  You know, because I just want to be able to see it at home.  Doug Benson, everyone.  How are you, Doug?  Hey, pretty good.  We fine.  I don't think we've ever had you on the show.  This is my first time. 
[02:35:30]  Exciting, huh?  Yeah.  I wore some proper protective gear.  No worries.  What have you heard?  I heard you guys were awesome and super nice.  We actually are.  If you're smelling anything, it's Jimmy.  He's been farting up a streak, have you said?  I honestly have been fucking gassing all morning.  Too much protein, Jimmy.  You and I.  Possibly, yeah.  We've got to back off on the protein.  Which is pretty bad.  Regular Paul Flart.  Who's that?  Oh, is that from the fucking...  Blart. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  I don't like Adam's movie being slammed.  I mean, that was a really...  I mean, that's just...  I came out good and blazing.  Release the chimp.  Everyone loves the chimp story.  How are you, Doug?  I'm good, thanks.  Oof.  It's good to be here.  You did a super high me?  That's right.  Yes.  You have to be careful when you say it out loud.  Just a super high...  Me, yeah.  Because people get confused.  Because if you just go super high, it sounds like it's about a Jewish superhero.  Jesse Jackson. 
[02:36:30]  Wow.  Yeah, exactly.  Jimmy.  What's the problem?  Are you going to embarrass people?  What, did Jimmy just blast one out really bad?  Yeah, but...  I didn't know why you were waving the pieces of paper.  Oh, he'll wave it over.  I was waving it away from Doug.  This is his first time here.  Thank you.  So I'll take the hint.  He wants everyone to enjoy it.  Oh, Jimmy.  He starts her...  What was that?  You're like Sophie's Choice.  Either Doug or Adam, and I lost.  There you go.  No!  No!  Why are you doing that?  It's, um...  It moves with the speed of, like, lava. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, it does.  It's just kind of...  And then the next thing you know...  It's the same...  And consistency.  They're sour.  They're sour, though, right, Adam?  Yeah.  It's like a sour...  Yeah, it's horrible.  It's like that is to it.  I have a sour stomach.  You're like...  If your fart had a face, it would be the frowning flace in the comedy and tragedy.  Yeah, frowning flace.  Once you said flace...  It affected my speech, Clark.  I've just been cast.  Yeah, once you said flace, it was over.  Yeah, there's no way to recover from flace.  Hit the car.  Right.  Hit it.  There we go.  Yeah, well, super high me. 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  I did see that.  And it's very interesting to see the effects of smoking pot.  Yeah, the kind of lack of effects, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  I just started to go about my business.  You just kind of...  You were all right with it, I guess.  Yeah.  I am all right with it.  You got a little lazy?  A little bit.  Yeah.  But that's true of me in general, you know?  Yeah.  Well, what is the thing...  It's like...  I mean, because you did the marijuana logs. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, you know, it's like...  You like to pot.  Doug really adores pot.  He sure does.  Yeah, and I take existing pop culture properties and just jam weed into it and call it my own.  But what was the difference between, like, your normal, ordinary just smoking pot and super high me?  Well, normally, I don't...  Like today, I haven't gotten high yet because it would have meant having to get up earlier, you know, to do that.  You know, I'm not that serious about it.  But I am, you know, I will smoke at some point today. 
[02:38:30]  So I'm like a daily user.  But in the movie, it was just nonstop from the second I woke up to the second I went to bed.  You were stoned all the time.  For 30 days.  For 30 days.  Yeah, on day 31, I still wanted to smoke someone.  I wasn't sick of it.  No.  I saw it, too.  I liked how scientific it was.  It was just like, how are you going to measure how much this guy is smoking?  Right.  And then they got, like...  They hooked you up with, like, an atomizer or something.  It was like this...  It was a...  Oh, it's a vaporizer. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, vaporizer.  The name of the machine, it's called a volcano, because it's sort of shaped like a volcano.  And, yeah, I got one of those.  They cost about 600 bucks, but the company gave me one, and I use it throughout the film.  But that's really...  It's funny that you said, oh, it's really scientific, the movie.  And then you described the machine I smoked out of.  Well, because it's a big, giant balloon, and this machine sucks, like, a metered amount  of pot smoke into this giant inflatable bag, and then, you know, Doug stands there and 
[02:39:30]  smokes his breakfast.  It steams the weed, so it's better...  It's, you know, it's not so bad on your lungs.  Yeah, not as harsh.  Yeah, but as it turns out, after, you know, 20 years of smoking pot, the, you know...  When you said science, I thought you were going to talk about all the tests we did during  the movie.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, I saw a doctor, and my lungs are fine, you know, like, I'm in perfectly  good shape.  Yeah, it was no problem.  So it's no big deal.  Yeah, the stat is actually, you not smoking, your lung capacity was 92%, and by using pot, 
[02:40:00]  it only went down three percentage points to 89%.  Yeah.  And everything else went up for you.  Yeah, everything was better, even my sperm count, which I think was a mistake at the  lab.  I don't think that could be true.  I thought the most surprising thing about that was they gave Doug an SAT test before  and after.  Yeah, yeah.  He actually scored higher on his SATs.  He was stoned.  I did.  I scored higher when I was higher.  That's correct.  Because it was less boring.  You know, it's less of a boring thing to take a test. 
[02:40:30]  If you're training in Chicago, wow, I'm in Chicago.  Now you're kind of interested.  I enjoyed it more, yeah.  A little bit more.  Not a lot more.  It's still stupid SATs.  Yeah.  And the whole thing, how did you skirt the issue of just doing something illegal on a  film?  Well, in California, you could just go see a shady doctor and get your medical marijuana  license.  Right.  And so, theoretically, the whole thing was legal.  Theoretically.  What was your ailment?  The feds disagree still. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, they still do?  Are they trying to slap something on you?  Not me, personally.  For my personal use, I don't think they'll come after me.  It's like that whole Michael Phelps thing.  I thought it was so ridiculous.  All right.  Some sheriff was like, we might press charges.  For a photographer, you can't even prove he wasn't just putting it to a list.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, what was in there, what was happening.  And also, that party, you know that there was underage drinking going on at that same  party.  It was a college party.  Yeah.  So, that was ridiculous.  But, fortunately, 13 states in this wonderful union, strangely enough, not New York yet, 
[02:41:30]  have medical marijuana laws where you theoretically could get away with it.  But these places where they sell it, the dispensaries, that's where the trouble starts because the  feds come in and bust those places.  Now, because it's a federal crime.  Yes.  Right.  So, it's not a local state crime.  So, their state laws kind of don't apply if the feds are there because they override  whatever the state law says.  That's hysterical.  Don't go on that day. 
[02:42:00]  How come it doesn't work the other way?  Whereas, when there's a federal constitutional right, let's say, oh, I'll pick one out of  my ass.  The Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.  How come a state is able to make up their own fucking rules?  A city in a state can make up their own fucking rules as far as who and what criteria it is  to get and own and conceal a handgun.  And yet, the federal government and your rights in the Constitution says that you do have the 
[02:42:30]  right to bear arms.  But the states can say, nah, fuck you.  Or the city in New York City can be like, well, we're going to make you jump through  hoops and pay a lot of money to even see if you can get one.  Why do you think that's good, though, for them to be able to make those things up?  It's not good.  It sucks.  Why do you like it so much?  It sucks.  Some guy called in and explained that, though.  We were talking about that one time.  One guy called in and explained why it was state control.  I don't remember his explanation.  It's stupid.  It's bullshit. 
[02:43:00]  It's the federal government.  Can I explain something to Doug?  Ant loves guns like you love pot.  Yes, there isn't a day that goes by where I don't have some type of interaction with  my gun.  Yes.  Whether I'm just cleaning it, shooting it, putting it, just walking around with it in  my holster.  And you're allowed to have it where you live?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I'm allowed to have that.  But see, I'm in a weird situation.  I have a New York State pistol license. 
[02:43:30]  I am allowed to own and possess a pistol in the state of New York.  I cannot even think about my guns in the city of New York.  I live on Long Island.  I cannot use my New York state permit in Connecticut or Jersey.  There's no way for me to leave the island.  I can't go up to upstate New York. 
[02:44:00]  Technically, I can.  There is a rule that says if I take the gun, unload it, put it in a blocked metal box in  a trunk separate from the ammunition, I can drive through any of the boroughs of New York  City, and then when I'm out of the New York City limits, I can then, again, wear the concealed  weapon.  But it's the city.  But then you can't stop.  How do I get from Long Island to anywhere else without going through city limits? 
[02:44:30]  How?  And go where?  Connecticut?  I'm not allowed to go to Connecticut.  I heard of you taking out of the way for this.  Jersey pass.  My license ain't good in Jersey or Connecticut.  That's right.  That's why I said that, smartass.  I can't take a boat.  Europe.  I can't.  Go to Europe.  Yeah, England.  And they're real hip on guns over there.  What about a helicopter?  I can't.  You can't take a helicopter?  No.  Where am I going?  To New York State.  You can go over Connecticut.  I don't think I could take my gun on an aircraft like that. 
[02:45:00]  You should give up the guns and start smoking pot.  I do both.  There you go.  Oh, jeezing, of course.  Oh, that's a joke.  Do the Arbud Dwyer method.  Like those old Vietnam footage.  You smoke out of like one of those shotguns.  Yeah.  Do a little shotgun.  It's just, it just annoys me that New York City is a whole different thing than New York State.  It's in the state.  I pass the criteria that New York State has put forth to own a pistol responsibly. 
[02:45:30]  I pass.  Every time I buy one, they do an FBI check on me.  They don't just do one.  Every time I buy one.  How do you pass, by the way?  I have to go to the police.  That's insane.  Every time I buy one.  The system is flawed.  Why?  I'm clean as a whistle.  How do you pass?  I have no frigging crimes at all.  I have to go to the police station.  One police station in Nassau County and get a piece of paper.  Yeah.  Then I got to go to the gun store.  Yeah.  And I got to give them the piece of paper.  Yeah.  And then I buy the gun.  Right.  And they give me the yellow sheet off of the piece of paper. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Then within 10 days, I got to go down and take the gun to the same police station and they  fill out all the paperwork.  You got to go back and forth and back and forth.  And every time you do that, FBI check.  On by rifle, FBI check.  Which, you know, that doesn't bother me.  Okay, you want to check me out?  I'm clean.  I don't care.  I'm fine with that.  But then New York City says, nope, you're not allowed in here.  Well, here's where the bad guys are.  Your brother has a loophole for you. 
[02:46:30]  Brother Joe.  Yeah, no, I was just saying for the people that don't have a carry, such as myself, all  I have is a target range permit.  For a long time, they have, actually everywhere, they have 24-hour ranges.  Oh, yeah.  And if you do get, you know, and you are allowed to carry to and from a range.  Yeah.  You don't have to have, you know, I mean, even if you're in your vehicle, you don't  have to have, you don't have to have it in a lockbox in the trunk.  But if you say that, you know, if you do get pulled over, and you do, of course, you  can't be an asshole. 
[02:47:00]  You've got to be, you know, you have to be straight up with the cop telling them that  you have a gun and say, I'm on my way to this range.  It's a 24-hour range.  They're generally pretty lenient, you know?  Yeah, but I'm talking about New York City.  Yeah, going through the city is a bitch.  I mean, even with a carry permit.  Yeah, you're not allowed.  You've got to lock it up.  But then they're trying to pass another law in New York State where you can't, you have  to put it in a locked trunk of a car, which takes out all SUVs. 
[02:47:30]  Like, I wouldn't be able to even now put it in a locked box and put it somewhere in my  SUV, because that would qualify as what they call, like, you know, a drop, where they have  these hidden compartments in SUVs.  And they're trying to make that illegal, which would only make it where you couldn't then  use a station wagon or an SUV or anything like that to transport your weaponry.  I had no idea that they were taking it to that extreme.  Yeah, there's another reason to go green, I guess.  Yeah, that's it.  You've got to drive your hybrid with your firearm.  Yeah, drive a hybrid with your guns in the back. 
[02:48:00]  I just, I'm disgusted.  It's always been to have it in your trunk if you were driving through the city, if you're  going through the city.  Yeah, and you can't stop.  You're not allowed to stop in the city, either, if you have it, and you're driving  to a ranger somewhere upstate.  You're not even allowed to stop to get a beverage in the city.  Can you stop at a regular light?  No, you've got to blow all the lights, blow the officers that pull you over, blow everything.  It's, yeah, it's just ridiculous.  I don't know.  I always get off on these little rants.  Hey, what's up, Pally? 
[02:48:30]  What's going on, man?  How are you, man?  I will not be carrying a gun at the Red Lion tonight down in the village.  Oh, wow.  He's getting good.  There you go.  He's actually getting good.  That was pretty good.  Are you two cover banders playing down there?  And you know what?  I want to see you, buddy.  I want to see you, too, but I'm going to leave my gun home while I'm at Gotham Comedy  Club.  Oh, wow.  Is anyone taking their guns anywhere?  And I'm done at the Red Lion.  We can go down to the range.  Very cool.  You took me once there.  I almost killed myself.  I remember that.  Yeah, you know what he did?  I told you about that. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, no.  What happened?  Jimbo is with us, right?  It's a barrel against his shoulder.  He's giving Adam step-by-step instruction.  Don't, you know, just like, you know, rack it.  Hold it in front of you.  Be careful.  You know, watch what you're doing.  Now you're ready to fire.  Adam fires one shot.  And he goes, whoa.  Whoa.  And then he goes to put the gun down.  The gun gets, the gun makes contact with the counter.  Boom.  Another shot goes.  Oh.  Yeah, but he doesn't tell you he handed me this SWAT machine pistol.  Okay?  This wasn't like a Derringer in the Old West. 
[02:49:30]  It was a Glock.  It was a Glock.  Yeah.  That went off when you put it down.  It was Jimmy's freaking...  I gotta forget.  I'm not going to say...  Wow.  Yeah.  I understand.  Humming up, humming up, humming up.  Where did the second bullet go?  What?  Where did the second bullet go?  Grassy Knoll.  Jimbo told him, don't point it anywhere but down range.  Yeah.  Because he could have been like, wow.  Joe Buck, take a look at this.  Boom.  Oh, well.  Wow.  A little hair trigger.  A little hair on that thing.  Wow.  It goes off at the thought.  It was just...  I think I want a fun...  Yeah, the thing had a hair trigger, too. 
[02:50:00]  Wow.  That was a fun day.  We gotta do more of that.  I don't like them Glocks, yo.  No.  No.  All right.  Not a fan of that.  Where are you going?  I'll talk to you.  Hi, Joe.  Hi, Joe.  What are you doing, Joe?  Doug Benson in the studio.  So, talking about pot and other things.  Doug, I want to know, did you have to go, like, with an ailment to get the medical marijuana?  Do you like...  Yeah, yeah.  You have to tell...  Dangerfield and Caddyshack?  My arm.  It's broken.  Yeah, you have to tell the doctor something, so I, you know, picked from the list a week  back, and... 
[02:50:30]  A week back will get you some weed?  Yeah, but it also sets up the classic joke when they say, you know, how long have you  had this condition?  Since about a week back.  Oh, I gotcha.  I'm getting.  That's all it takes, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  And then...  Anxiety, depression, you know, upset about gun laws.  Any of those will get you a medical marijuana.  I've said that I can't buy weed anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it's funny, because as long as you have, like, a license for this medical... 
[02:51:00]  You just go in, and I mean, it would be...  To me, I was watching this going, all right, this is a little ridiculous, because if it's  really medical marijuana, why is it in jars labeled, you know, a purple haze?  Yeah, they got names.  Early culture kush.  Killer, killer kush, yeah.  And then these guys that run these dispensaries get all upset when the feds come after them.  Like, hey, man, I'm running a legal business here.  But look at the names of your product, man.  And it's like, and anybody could get one of these licenses to buy this legal pot. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, obviously, Doug got one, but then there are the people that really, you know,  that are prescribed it by legitimate doctors, you know, who have cancer, and they're using  it for chemo or what have you, and that's fine.  But then anyone like Doug could go in and just start buying hundreds of dollars worth  of legal weed.  It's definitely legal.  I'm making a movie.  Now, how much comparably to buying from a dealer?  What's the difference in price?  The prices are really similar.  Really?  Especially, like, you know, the prices, you know, New York weed's a lot pricier than the 
[02:52:00]  stuff in the dispensaries in California.  Is there a limit to it on how much you can buy, like, per time?  There is some limit, but I somehow have never...  Never hit it.  Never hit that ceiling, yeah.  Now, now, also, if you have this license that entails you, you're able to go in and buy  this medical marijuana, what's to prevent you from just buying on the street using that,  and then if something happens where an officer sees you, you just pull out your license and  go, hey, I'm smoking this.  Is there a difference between medical and street-bought?  Yeah, because there's people that...  And how do they tell?  The medical people have their own license that they get from the state that's like a... 
[02:52:30]  They're called caregivers.  The caregivers.  Yeah, so your average dude, you know, that just comes to your house or something, he doesn't  have...  But how could...  Would a cop be able to tell if you bought the pot, you're smoking, like, you're smoking  a joint, and the cop's like, hey, what are you doing?  I'm smoking a joint.  I got my license here.  Is there a way they could tell if you bought it from the street or from the dispensary?  The containers have...  They look like a prescription, like they, you know, it's a prescription bottle. 
[02:53:00]  It's got a container or something.  Yeah, but once you roll it...  It's got a label on it.  Yeah, if you roll a joint, you don't have the container.  I guess you have to show your prescription.  Yeah, you show your...  It's basically a letter from the doctor.  It's not even really like a license or a prescription.  Yeah, it's a total doctor's note that says, to whom it may concern...  He can smoke pot, signed, his mom.  I actually had cops roll up on me in Sunnyvale, California.  I was smoking pot before a show with a dude in his truck, and the cops came up, and the 
[02:53:30]  guy just knew what to say.  He was just like, we just arrived here, we're not going to be driving, and we both have our  doctor's notes, and we took them out, and we showed them to the cops, and they phoned it  in.  We didn't have any priors, so they just let us go.  Okie doke.  Smoke them if you got them.  That's Sunnyvale, California.  You try that here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you got a note.  Good.  In the back of the car.  Yeah.  No, that's the thing, is you'd probably spend a night in jail here if you get caught with  anything.  What you should have done was you should have blown the smoke out and went, I'm taking my 
[02:54:00]  medicine, pig.  Yeah, they like that.  I'm strong with boss.  So obviously you think it should be legal federally, all over the country.  Every state should have medical marijuana.  Yeah, well, every state, it would be quite a stimulus if it happened, because every state  could tax it, and it's the number one cash crop in California already, even though it's  supposedly illegal. 
[02:54:30]  It really is amazing, because we've had this conversation before, that booze is completely  legal.  I mean, it's illegal to drink in excess and drive and things like that.  There are regulations on it, age regulations.  It's taxed up the ass, things like that.  Why so anti-pot this country?  It seems like something that's been carried over from the old days where they thought it  was just a stepping stone to heroin.  Reefer madness!  But it's, I've never seen somebody smoke weed and be as stupid, as irresponsible, as incapacitated 
[02:55:00]  as people that have drank to excess, including myself.  I see it every night in the comedy clubs, you know, especially since Super Jaime came out,  like, all the stoners come to my shows, and then they have a few drinks, and then they  become drunks.  You know, like, it's a totally different animal all of a sudden.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Like, drunks are the ones that fucking heckle and start yelling shit out.  The drunk women are the worst.  Oh.  God.  At least you can fuck them. 
[02:55:30]  Theoretically, yeah.  But, like, bachelorette parties and comedy shows, that's the...  They're terrific.  They always make the show better.  They point at the one girl, and you're like, oh, my God.  What's your big day?  So, what are you girls here?  Bachelorette party?  Over here!  Who's the girl?  Which one's the girl?  The one with the dick straw.  We have a cock-shaped cake.  They have the cock-shaped cake at bachelorette parties, because once she gets married, that's 
[02:56:00]  the last dick she'll ever eat.  Exactly.  So, when's the big day?  Next Thursday!  Oh, congratulations.  Where's your fiancé tonight?  He's out!  He's out!  He's having his party!  Oh, his bachelor party.  So, where do you think he is?  He's at a Starbucks, he told me.  What do you think he is?  It's the same fucking thing.  Every time.  I've seen it a thousand times.  And they have to sit in the front, too.  Oh, they've got to sit right up front with their yapping drunk mouths. 
[02:56:30]  That's what the comedian wants to say.  Shut up, you and your stupid bridesmaids.  That's the worst.  When the manager goes, we've got a bachelorette party.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  Through the whole show with my cock out and pre-cum dripping in their drink.  How great would that be to fucking, you know, shake your dick with clear stuff on it and  the clear stuff flies?  Of course.  How great would it be to fucking shake clear stuff all over it?  It's like a fucking dick loogie.  The night before a big day.  Here you go, whore.  I hope it's stuck in your hair.  God, she's crying.  We were having such a good time and then the comedian's pee-pee sneezed. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, it'd be like that scene in fucking, you know, Jurassic Park when the fucking dinosaur  sneezes in the kid's face.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul.  Jesus.  Those, those, what did you say, those are the worst?  Those are the worst.  Hecklers and shit like that.  Those are the worst.  Yeah.  Drunk and women.  Packs of drunk when they're in groups and they're drunk.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I just always, the women are annoying and they have this attitude like they don't give a  shit. 
[02:57:30]  They pay.  They want to be there.  Fuck you.  But then there's the guy that has to be the center of attention.  Yeah.  And if, if he gets one line out that gets a laugh, you're fucked.  Because I've just seen it's like, oh boy, now he's not going to shut up.  But there's always the drunk guy, right?  Then when he reaches the point of no return, we're like, he's embarrassed himself.  But if he backs off, he's just got to keep going until he gets thrown out.  You know, when you're embarrassed, you know it, but you just keep going.  And yeah, they take it to the lobby after the show.  So if you like selling merchandise or something, they got there, they're in your face afterwards. 
[02:58:00]  Right.  Thanks.  And it's always, I was helping the show.  I was, why did they throw me out?  We were just laughing.  I was just having fun.  You know, this whole thing's about having fun.  No, it's about me doing my fucking act and you shutting up.  Well, you got to have a deal.  If a guy's really yelling and screaming at you, like being really abusive, I'll always  hit him with something like really harsh.  Like, uh, you know, sir, these people paid to see me, not you.  Ooh.  Wow.  Jimmy.  Easy.  A little early for that kind of talk.  Sam, you want anyone coming back to your shows? 
[02:58:30]  Jim, the new city is called Jim Norton.  Take no prisoners.  That's it.  I was working at a club in Columbia, Missouri, at Deja Vu, and the bouncers would not even  walk over to people.  They would just, from where they're standing, go, shh.  Oh, shit.  Wonderful.  Really loud.  It was just like, and I'm on stage going, it's me?  Am I supposed to be quiet?  Yeah, man.  I'll type down.  Who are you shushing?  Do you remember, you may remember, Adam, at the comedy cell, there was a guy, he was, 
[02:59:00]  I forget where he was from, he was a Palestinian.  Uh, Mustafa.  Mustafa, yeah.  And he was the door guy for a while.  He eventually became like Chappelle's manager and personal guy, but he was the door guy.  And the comedians love this motherfucker.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He was one of those alpha male, fucking crazy Middle Eastern dudes.  And he didn't care if there was nine pimps at a table.  He would walk over, shut the fuck up.  Anyone who taught, shut the fuck up.  This fucking lunatic. 
[02:59:30]  He was fearless, this dude.  Really?  And he loved this dude.  He'd say, any problems, you'll let me know.  He fucking loved, he would, he would ask someone, eh, keep it down, be quiet, but they got,  if they tried to alpha male him, he chased one guy down the street and, uh, the guy fell  and broke his leg, he was a fucking, he was getting away from a chip or something.  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't miss girls as much as I miss this dude.  But, uh, it was the fucking, it was the fucking greatest when he was there.  Mustafa at the comedy cellar was the greatest. 
[03:00:00]  Wow.  Oh, would he shut people up immediately?  You ever have, uh, when you're, when you're doing gigs out on the road, you ever have Kenny  have to step in and say some stuff?  Because I know Kenny's with you on the road.  Yeah, usually, the problem is, and I had this at Caroline's one night, uh, oh, were you  at that show when people had to leave or no?  That was the next night, I think, yeah.  There was people that had to, we had to get a lot of them out, a table was being really  rambunctious, and Kenny was out doing the merch, so it was only the one guy inside.  Oh, shit.  So I had to work out.  They weren't being physical, but I had to get a better system, uh, because Kenny, of 
[03:00:30]  course, would have.  Oh, solved the problem immediately.  Well, Kenny escalated it immediately.  Yeah, so it would have just been, I don't want to, I don't, I don't want to lose Mike  at Westchester.  We got, Mike, we got Doug Benson in the studio, and, uh, this guy gets his weed in the mall.  What?  Well, that's why we got, in the mail.  Oh.  Oh, in the mail.  No, that's not a fucking dumb phone screener.  No, it's, I don't, no, it says wall up there.  That's not a guy getting it.  I could go for a melted right now.  Yeah.  Hey, how's that movie Mail Cop doing? 
[03:01:00]  Phone call's not as interesting, but still.  Oh, we, Mike.  That woman was mailed by that, uh, chimp.  Did you see that?  It really was.  Well, you know what?  The chimp was a very, a very possessive mall.  Yeah.  And he thought that it was the alpha mall.  That's right.  Oh, guys, let's get into the silly zone.  That's what I said.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  I'm having a rough day.  I thought, I thought the copy said rape video.  Yes, you did.  You're a mess.  And now I thought this said, uh, mall instead of mail.  Mike, I don't know if your story's going to be as good now that it's not a mall, but what 
[03:01:30]  do you got?  Hey, guys, what's up?  If I, uh, actually get my herb through, uh, through the United States post office sent  to me through from, uh, California.  Oh, yeah.  Mm.  And legally, obviously, right?  Legally.  Oh, yeah, of course.  It's, uh, legally.  Yeah, sure.  It's not.  That's what I got.  It's silly.  Isn't it?  But, uh, there is actually a medical marijuana vote going on on Monday for the state of New  Jersey.  Well, good luck, because that won't pass.  You think, well, hopefully you can get out there and vote. 
[03:02:00]  It won't.  I'm not going to vote.  I live in fucking New York.  Go fuck yourself, Jersey.  Yeah, let's go vote.  You think medical marijuana will be in every state eventually?  Eventually, I think so, right?  It's already in 13.  It seems like Michigan just passed it.  It seems like they're kind of like, uh...  You got gambling.  Go fuck yourself.  That's it.  That's where it's going to go.  Yeah.  They want gambling and pot.  But it looks like they're feeling it out to see, all right, well, now it's medical marijuana.  Let's start making a little money off this thing.  Yeah, it's a slow process.  Maybe, isn't it odd, though, that California is the most broke-ass fucking state in the 
[03:02:30]  union right now, and they have electricity.  So that's kind of like, eh.  Yeah, that's true.  Imagine Arnold just gets really desperate and goes, let's legalize marijuana to save  the state.  Heroin, marijuana.  They're running out of money, like, next week or something.  Because they are taxing it out there.  Like, when I buy it in a medical shop, it's taxed.  A little tax action.  I guess it's not that many people.  They should make it more accessible to people that just want to do it.  Like, fucking liquor stores.  You don't need a license to buy a fucking bottle of booze. 
[03:03:00]  Just go in, buy some fucking weed, tax the shit out of it, and watch this economy fly.  And who cares?  You're not going to start smoking pot because it's legal.  I really don't think that's going to happen.  I think you would anyway.  Imagine they do that to save the economy.  Save the economy with weed.  Obama just gets on TV.  Look.  Just fucking blowing fields of pot.  Like fucking amber waves of grain.  Of green.  Of green.  Of green.  You know who gets addicted? 
[03:03:30]  Cereal companies report record problems.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Some of the things I would say would be great.  More cereal being sold.  The police have not issued a speeding ticket in 18 months to the States.  No one's leaving their house.  Yeah.  That's what would happen.  Doug, are you sick of...  DVD cartoon sales through the roof.  But, Doug, all the movies they review, the dumbest ones are like number one.  The Oscars.  Wall-E wins.  Best picture.  Doug, are you sick of talking about pot at this point? 
[03:04:00]  You're known as the pot guy.  He loves it.  Be honest.  Are you sick of it?  I love smoking it a lot more than talking about it.  Yeah.  I see it on TV a lot.  And they all mention it.  Yeah.  I meet dudes all the time, especially at my shows, that are like, you know, they treat  it like, you know, wine connoisseurs.  They come up to me and they're like, what's your favorite strain?  Strain.  Wow.  You know, and it's just like, well, if you get attached to any particular strain, it'll  vanish on you. 
[03:04:30]  And then where are you?  I can't smoke that shit.  I'm not going to smoke that strain.  But aren't you concerned, though, that Doug...  I'm not smoking any fucking Merlot.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, you got one of those questions coming right now, Doug.  But, Jimmy.  Why the question?  I'll go to the question.  I'm sorry.  Dave and Oneonta.  Jimmy.  Dave and Oneonta.  Yo, what's happening, fellas?  Hey.  I'm Benson.  I'm a huge fan of you, man.  Cucumber boat wire.  Nice.  Yes.  I was actually wondering, because I have food behind me, and I know you ate a lot of food 
[03:05:00]  and you did lip balm and all that.  What was the most, like...  What got you the biggest high?  Hmm.  Well, you know, the edibles are pretty awesome, because that gives you that, you know, what  they call a body high, as opposed to just being high.  Like the cookies and stuff?  Yeah, because it gets into your bloodstream.  So, like, it's like, now, any time I have to fly or, you know, sit on a train or something,  I'll just take, like, the pot comes in pills now. 
[03:05:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  And I'll, uh...  Really?  I'm done?  No.  I'll take those...  You're annoyed?  I'll take those pills and just, you know, be completely high on the flight or whatever  and, you know, not bother anyone.  I know, like, Joe Rogan just comes in here with those pot lollipops, and he'll fucking  sit here and just suck on a pot lollipop for the whole show, and he's getting stung.  Oh, Rogan is a fucking stoner, yeah.  He's taught us a lot about drugs.  He doesn't fucking, like, calm down.  No, he's into pot and, uh, ultimate fighting. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  That's the strangest combo.  How does that happen?  Maybe he's got a smoke pot.  If he doesn't, he'll be like that chimp.  Oh, my God, yeah.  And just rip people's faces off.  That's all he would do is kill all day long if Joe Rogan didn't smoke pot.  Jimmy had a question that we keep interrupting.  I'm sorry, Jim.  No, dude, it was, uh, because they say it leads to harder things, and I'm saying that  you do, uh, you know, you smoke herb, but you're worried now that you're going to  start doing horse.  The H?  Yeah.  Benny's, Dexy's, meth.  I get so high, I'm like, I want to put a needle in my arm. 
[03:06:30]  Goofballs?  That would help.  Are you doing, girl?  The smack.  That's always better.  I don't buy the whole giveaway thing, and they say, uh, uh, Dr. Drew himself recently  said that the only people who are addicted to marijuana are alcoholics.  Really?  Like, if you, yeah, if you're, if you have a tendency to be addicted to something, you  know, if you're going to, then you might have a problem with pot, but everyone else,  you know.  Yeah, addictive personality, you get addicted to anything. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, exactly.  But, uh, you know, weed, I think, uh, the whole thing with the federal government and  weed makes no sense because of the booze thing.  Like, if they, and they tried that, and that didn't work very well, outlawing booze.  Yeah, cigarettes, too.  They tax the things.  Cigarettes, they know cigarettes fucking kill you.  They just, they fucking kill you.  Starbucks has this country under more of an addictive vice than pot growers.  Than weed.  Yeah, absolutely right.  Don't judge me, Benson.  There would be, there would not be a pot store on every fucking corner with the lines of 
[03:07:30]  people coming out of it.  It just wouldn't happen.  Like a Starbucks.  Yeah, it would.  But, there would, no, it would be the same people.  It would, uh, but it really makes no sense.  People are going to get some shit done that day, and the people that go to the pot store  have no plans.  Nothing going on today.  They're sitting across the street going, look at those ants.  Do you think maybe it's, it's more accepted that you could go out for lunch, uh, and like  you would a cigarette, maybe smoke a joint if it was legal, go back to work, and your  productivity's down. 
[03:08:00]  Whereas if you go out and you drink, you know, that's grounds for getting fucking fired.  Well, I guess at the workplace, they could say, if you, you know, we find you smoking  pot, you're fucking fired.  Yeah, I say, if you're doing your job, what, you know, what difference does it make what  you're doing, you know?  You have to get to your job first, and that's hard enough when you, you know, wake and  beg.  Nobody wants their attorney getting high.  Yeah, that's about it.  Or a surgeon.  Your Honor, you're just so hostile.  Do you have a closing statement?  I'm so fucking high.  Dude, look at your hair. 
[03:08:30]  You know, he did tell me he killed that person.  Oh, shit, was I supposed to say?  We got a drug detective on the line, Chris in Montana.  Chris.  Montana drug detective.  What is a drug detective?  Bringing all that Canadian pot down through there, right?  Hey, what's up, gents?  Right?  Yeah, that's all we get is the Canadian stuff.  Or you start the way you want.  Canadian pot.  That's right.  Top quality.  Hey, you know, I've been working for about five years.  There was a gentleman, and a guy the other day, actually a guy from Guatemala of all places  told me, he said, in a great line, I thought it was, I want to share it with you, he says, 
[03:09:00]  you know, pot is the drug of tomorrow.  I said, what do you mean by that?  He says, because when I smoke pot, it makes me want to do everything tomorrow.  So that's my thing on, uh...  You're right, that was a great line.  Wow.  Maybe translated.  You know, but in Guatemalan, it's different.  It isn't something.  The Campari would say, why do you smoke so much pot, Campari?  But in Guatemala, it sounds much nicer. 
[03:09:30]  It sounds much nicer.  That's fucking hilarious.  Yeah, the caller, the caller's in, he's content with being an idiot.  Did I ever show you my paintings?  I use my fingers.  My whole issue with pot, Jantz, is the fact that it just wrecks everybody's motivation.  Yeah, because other people's motivation is really, like, your concern on a day-to-day.  Who cares if people, other people aren't doing stuff?  You can take over the world.  More jobs for you.  Don't you think your job would be a lot easier if the criminals were high? 
[03:10:00]  Like, I don't want to rob anybody today.  You know?  You know, that's why they call it dope, you know?  Wow.  Listen, do you have all the bumper stickers laid out on the table, and you're just going to read each one to them?  I bet he's got, like, the crew cut and the cop mustache.  Yeah, he looks like a fucking picture of Jack Webb.  Absolutely.  And I said, hey, citizen, you're going to get shot in the face.  Thank you, Reservoir Dogs. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, I didn't even get that.  Sir, can we pry that cliche from your cold, dead hand?  Fucking pile of zeros.  We're a calm people in Montana.  What's that, sir?  They're calm.  We're a calm people.  Yes, they are.  Of course you are.  A bunch of moose fuckers.  You're frozen.  Exactly.  I think you can pay cash for speeding tickets there.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Take care of it right here in Brainerd.  A little cash and a little Hummer, and you're good to go?  All right, Chris.  That's in Fargo. 
[03:11:00]  Take care.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We take care of it right here in Brainerd.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Quick break.  Doug Benson, what are we promoting today there?  I'm doing this show on VH1 tonight and tomorrow night at 11 called Best Day Ever, and Super  Jaime's going to make its broadcast television debut on a obscure cable network called G4  on April 20th.  Ah, uncut.  Now, Best Day Ever.  Hopefully.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Cut out all the parts where you're smoking.  I heard they could show me only inhaling or exhaling. 
[03:11:30]  I forget which one.  So the whole movie's just going to be one or the other.  All right, we're going to continue with Doug Benson in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Anthony, Adam Farrar, Jim Norton, and for the first time on our show, Doug Benson,  everyone.  I'm getting a contact high just sitting next to him.  From Super Jaime.  We should, like, help him out and talk about anything but pot for the next ten minutes.  Yes, of course.  Well, you're on to the pop culture thing.  You do Best Week Ever, and now it's this thing called Best Day Ever, and I was just 
[03:12:00]  talking to Doug about it.  It's like a three-minute little show.  Yeah, it's a short, you know, for those of you that 30 minutes was too long, here's three  minutes of entertainment.  But it's perfect.  It's the big hot story or a couple hot stories of the day, and then you guys skew it and have  a little fun with it, and then you move back onto Bromance or Rock Bus or whatever the  fuck the H1 is playing.  Yesterday, I did a bit that, like, late in the day, the lawyers at VH1 said, oh, sorry, 
[03:12:30]  you've got to change that to something else.  Oh, God.  Tell us what it was.  We love the lawyers.  And it was, the bit was, you know how there was that lady on CNN that kept saying penis  when she meant to say peanuts?  Yes.  Love it.  Love that bit.  We show that clip, and then we pretend to be moving on to the next story, and whenever  I said chihuahua, referring to Mickey Rourke's dead dog, instead of chihuahua, I'd say chihuahua.  Vagina.  I kept doing that.  Vagina, chihuahua, vagina. 
[03:13:00]  And then the lawyer said, Mickey Rourke can sue us because it sounds like you're saying  he fucks his dogs.  What?  What?  No.  Shut up.  I swear.  I swear to you that was the problem.  I didn't deal with the same lawyers, by the way.  I thought they were going to say, like, well, you say it too many times, it's pandering.  No, no.  That's cable.  No, no, yeah.  We can say it, because what we changed it to was something dirtier.  But the problem was, I think that the particular lawyer was like a dog lover or felt bad for 
[03:13:30]  Mickey Rourke, but we weren't making fun of his dog dying.  We were making fun of the penis lady.  Don't you love when they put their personal shit in?  Yeah, yeah.  Don't you love when the lawyers take their personal agenda or ethics?  They're lawyers, so I don't even know how to have any of those.  They were like, if Mickey Rourke sues us, we would have to settle because we can't afford  to fight him.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not just Mickey Rourke.  If anybody sues you, you're going to have to settle.  How would Mickey Rourke sue under the guy that you're saying that he fucked his dog based  on you just saying vagina? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  They're ruining entertainment, these lawyers.  It's really weird.  Because they think way ahead and think of something that most likely isn't going to happen ever.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It just ruins what you're trying to do.  It's a strange thing.  Oh, is that infuriating?  Mm-hmm.  God.  I think we do have the same lawyers, by the way.  Yeah.  No, literally.  I think we do.  Under the corporate umbrella, I think.  Yeah.  I think it all leads to those douches.  Yeah.  There's just one giant corporation that runs everything, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Konglom.  Absolutely.  The Death Star. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  But check it out tonight at 11 to see what I manage to get on the air.  Ah, good.  Okay.  Better than vagina.  I like it.  It's quick, easy.  In between shows, it's nice.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's a nice little concept.  Maybe run it a bunch of times, like at 3 in the morning and 7 and 11.  So it's a fun thing to do.  It's a fun thing to do.  It's a fun thing to do.  You know, short attention span, that whole thing, where you used to ... They're trying  to get more like computers, where you just, for a few minutes, you're clicking around and  you find yourself looking at some video. 
[03:15:00]  I talk about that, how it happens to me constantly.  I'm doing my banking, and I'll have no idea why 10 short minutes later I'm looking at some  fucking, you know, guy sitting on a jelly jar with it smashing in his asshole.  Wait a minute.  I was banking.  I was banking.  Where do you keep your money?  Yeah, exactly.  Was it at least empty?  In that jar.  It really is amazing, but that's kind of what TV needs to do, because I think we're all 
[03:15:30]  getting used to that.  Yeah.  I just want to check this out.  And you all have your own little worlds and spaces, like the Facebook thing and YouTube.  You get your own account.  What about Twitter?  Twitter.  Doug Benson's a Twitter.  I call it shitter.  Doug Benson tweets.  Does he like to have fun with it?  But all those things, they give you your own little site.  So you go there to check out or update your own stuff, and then you find yourself clicking 
[03:16:00]  on other things, and for three minutes, you're watching a couple of videos that other people  put up.  So it's that quick hit shit that just never used to fly.  Back in the old days, you fucking sat down and you watched Walter Cronkite for a half  a fucking hour babble on about the nom.  Can I talk to my fellow Twitter here?  What are you on Twitter?  It's my name, Doug Benson.  Doug Benson, one word, none of those...  I managed to get my own name.  That's pretty good. 
[03:16:30]  Nice.  Like, people are listening to this show right now and commenting on it on my Twitter.  So if you want to follow Doug Benson, it's Doug Benson on Twitter.  Yeah, somebody said, be careful, it always hurts the first time.  Uh-oh.  What, the show?  I don't know if he's an actual guest or not.  And then another guy wrote, pot is the drug of tomorrow?  What the fuck?  That dude needed to smoke.  That's from Row 20.  Some guy named Goose just wants a shout-out.  Fuck Goose.  Yeah, and fuck his fucking ejections from that damn plane.  Got what he deserves. 
[03:17:00]  Good for him.  Ugly Goose.  Leave me alone in Iceman.  Yeah.  How could you come looking at Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise and Ugly Goose?  Wouldn't he ruin it every time?  He didn't even take his shirt off for the volleyball game.  Of course he could.  Why would he?  Well, he has the bad chest.  The big volleyball game.  They had horrible pecs, obviously.  Come on.  People were suggesting that Top Gun should be the first movie I play.  Oh, what is going to be the first movie?  It's so gay.  I wouldn't fucking do that.  The sound, the fighter seems to be cool, but...  What's...  I do have it on Blu-ray.  If you want... 
[03:17:30]  You got it on Blu-ray?  Travis actually got it for him as a kid.  They remastered and shit?  I'm thinking Gladiator or 300, something like that.  How about Apocalypto?  Yeah, 300.  Apocalypto.  Did you see that?  Yeah, but I don't fucking understand what they're saying.  Dude, it's such a great movie.  It's Earth of a Nation, come on.  I don't know, maybe Downfall.  Earth of a Nation.  Birth of a Nation, it didn't come out in Blu-ray.  I got Clockwork Orange in Blu-ray on that big screen.  That was fucking wonderful.  Yeah?  I want something with a lot of, like, action and noise.  Apocalypse Now?  Check it out.  Home Theater. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  1941.  Yeah, there you go.  1941.  That's a spectacle for you.  Saving Private Ryan.  Oh, there you go.  Might be a good one.  The opening scene there would be good.  So, I don't know.  You just flip through the bookend of Saving Private Ryan.  That stuff is bullshit.  What?  The middle part?  Yeah.  The scenes in the, you know, cemetery at the beginning and end.  Yeah.  And the old age makeup and all that shit.  You didn't feel a little choked up at that?  Oh, I probably did. 
[03:18:30]  I mean, it's manipulative as all hell.  But, like, on repeat viewings, you don't need to see the sad parts.  Yeah, it is alright.  I know that this is that guy.  Yeah, you want to see Tom Sizemore and Tom Hanks on the fucking beach.  Yeah.  People getting blown in half.  You know, Tom Sizemore, what happened to him?  Why not Back to the Future?  People are suggesting Back to the Future also.  It just came out, right, in Blu-ray?  Is that said in Blu-ray?  Because I must watch it in Blu-ray.  I don't know.  Very good. 
[03:19:00]  Nice.  Yeah, I don't think it's not Blu-ray.  I think they just put, like, new extras in.  Motherfuckers!  Why wouldn't they remaster it?  I think it's the first time that they actually released all the discs separately.  Goldberg is going to do it all, like, fucking...  Is it still going to have a flux capacitor?  It damn well better.  Yeah, it should.  It really should.  It's not a DeLorean.  It's probably going to be Gladiator.  Gladiator.  Gladiator's a good one.  That's a good choice.  Gladiator's pretty fucking good, beginning and end.  A lot of action.  Good fucking movie.  Gay giraffes.  Gay giraffes.  You sold me queer giraffes.  What about Black Hawk Down? 
[03:19:30]  Black Hawk Down's another good one.  That would kick ass.  Any Ridley Scott fucking movie.  Alien would be fantastic.  Not any Ridley Scott movie.  There's that one about the wine country.  All right, fuck that.  In France.  Yeah, we don't need that.  What was that?  It was, what's his name?  It was Gladiator.  It was...  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  Perfect Season or something like that.  It was shit.  It was shite.  A time for shit.  The hell was I thinking?  That's what it was called.  Yeah.  It's probably...  We're really looking like it's gonna be Blu-ray Gladiator on an 11 foot screen. 
[03:20:00]  Nice.  It would be fucking beautiful.  Which Doug Benson on Twitter?  Is there Doug?  There's one that's a gay activist.  All right.  So that...  Wow.  That might be me.  That's Doug Banks.  My name is Doug Benson.  I'm here recruiting you to smoke pot.  Yeah.  Incestuous.  Yeah.  It's just my name with no space in between.  Doug Benson.  Doug Bend over.  No underscore. 
[03:20:30]  Just Doug Benson.  All right.  On Twitter.  Yeah, I noticed on my Facebook there's a few.  And there's a picture of me like that Obama image, but underneath it, instead of hope,  it says dope.  Dope.  That makes sense.  Some fan made it for me.  That's pretty cool.  I noticed on my Facebook there's a few Anthony Cumias out there.  One is Anthony Cumia for president, which people just get on and babble about me.  And I don't really comment on it.  Right.  But some of it is very insulting.  But you know, 2012 isn't that far away. 
[03:21:00]  So it's a good thing to get the campaign rolling.  It's insulting.  He should never get a carry permit.  It's very insulting.  I hate the fact he's armed.  Twister, they're saying you should watch.  Twister.  Finger of God, man.  There's a twister coming quick.  I hated that.  Grab ahold of this belt.  Hated that movie.  It's coming this way.  They can so stupid.  They blow houses in the air.  They can't blow a t-shirt off of Helen Hunt.  No, thank God.  Wet.  Nothing.  Why would you want to see that?  That big upper lip off. 
[03:21:30]  Fucking beluga whale.  She's all wet and pay it forward.  You could see a t-shirt on that, I think.  Not a fan of her name.  Nah.  It's coming this way.  It's already here.  Not it.  It was called The Good Year by Willie Scott.  What about the F4?  F4.  Mm-hmm.  No, F5.  Is it F5?  Finger of God.  Everyone drops their silverware.  It's so fucking dramatic.  They're all like, yeah, we're the bad extreme.  We're chasing fucking tornadoes.  Are you?  Okay.  Get a fucking job.  And learn to run away from danger. 
[03:22:00]  When Cary Ellis is the bad guy, you know a movie's not good.  Yeah.  And it's corporate.  They're corporate sponsored, man.  They're not as cool as us, man.  Yes.  And then everybody watching had a better idea for that Dorothy thing than they did.  Why you fucking got to take it out of the back of the truck?  Put it on a trailer with a hitch and just pull the pin.  There.  Now the thing's set exactly where you want it.  Put it on a remote control and drive it into the fucking tornado.  Movies suck.  Then they're there cutting little propellers to put on the fucking things. 
[03:22:30]  Stop it.  They're Pepsi cans.  Yeah.  I think they'd fly up anyway.  Stupid ass movie.  That was before Philip Seymour Hoffman was Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Yeah.  He's in it and he's so annoying.  He's so extreme.  Yeah.  Like everything.  Yeah.  And then years later you find out, oh, that guy's a good actor.  He really committed to that terrible part.  He played that awful well.  You think he's embarrassed that he made that movie?  I think so.  Also sense of a woman.  He's in that.  He's in that one.  He was good in that though.  Was he? 
[03:23:00]  I fucking forgot about that.  He wasn't Harry.  He was George.  George Jr.  He was good in that.  He's a great actor.  But like, you know, for a while he was in shit movies.  Fucking Boogie Nights.  Then he got a reputation.  He is so fucking good in Boogie Nights.  He was great in that.  When he's holding that boom mic and can't contain himself watching Dirk Diggler and he  just goes like.  He can't breathe because he's so worked up.  Dude, that tight shirt on his awful stomach.  That was great.  Oh, that was great.  He bought the same clothes.  Dirk Diggler.  Can I paint you on the mouth?  Can I paint his car the same color? 
[03:23:30]  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  You want to kiss me?  I'm an idiot.  You see him in doubt?  I gotta see that.  Jimmy, you see doubt?  I did not know.  As the pedo priest?  No.  I'd love to see that.  It's a great movie.  Well, not a great movie.  It's a good movie.  Meryl Streep is the biggest C in movie history in this movie.  She's kind of a cunt in Kramer vs. Kramer too.  She's worse than this movie.  That was it, right?  As an old nun.  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  That one?  I'm an idiot?  No, that's Napoleon Diamond. 
[03:24:00]  What do you got?  Oh.  I just wanted to hear I'm an idiot.  I don't know what happened.  It said I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  Even Alfred Molina says, don't mind him, he's Chinese.  Cheering the other side of his mouth.  That's Chinese.  He's a French fan.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[03:24:30]  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot, fucking idiot, fucking idiot, fucking idiot.  He just wanted a kiss.  That's why the movie's three hours long.  The great part was, can I kiss you on the mouth?  And when he said no.  But then he's like, well, do you want to kiss me?  Like, that would help.  Like, yeah, I do, actually.  Do you want to kiss me?  Do you want to kiss me?  What the hell?  He just put it that way.  Him and Dirk were just going to go to town.  He was going to get that big, fat Dirk Diggler cock in him.  He didn't even want the big dick.  He wanted to caress his hair while he kissed him. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, he wanted to, like, love.  He wanted to pet him like a chimp.  I want to show you my car.  And he painted it the same colors.  Piece of shit car.  He painted it like his vet.  I want you to think it's cool.  I've got to watch that again.  That's a good one.  It's so fucking great.  Maybe that'll be the first movie.  That is a great movie in a high-quality home theater.  Yes.  Except for the last scene.  Fucking Heather Graham as Roller Girl.  Except for that last scene when he shows his dick, it was so stupid.  Yeah, he didn't have to do that. 
[03:25:30]  I didn't need to see it.  Yeah, it was like a...  Not soft, anyway.  I wanted to see it nice and big and hard.  Yeah, attaboy.  He should have even just shown it.  That would have been ridiculous.  That thing was huge flaccid.  Or either that, or it should have been ridiculously huge, where it was laid out on his dresser,  like the size of a fucking baloney.  Well, you just see...  That's how he sleeps in the head.  You see the head, like, even with the ankles, a low shot down.  Yeah, it's coming out of his pant leg.  Yeah.  Or not even that.  Just open the robe and white light comes out.  I gotta post it from E-Rock. 
[03:26:00]  Yes?  We have a special guest waiting for us in the office.  And I'm like, fuck that, bring him in.  I hope this isn't a meeting.  No, it's no meeting.  I'm good.  Who is it?  We're finishing up, but bring him in.  Sam?  It's a special guest.  Sam is bringing in the special guest.  He's very famous as far as this radio show goes.  Is he?  Yes, it's Sam's dad!  Oh, my God!  I didn't know who that was at first, but I saw the handlebar mustache.  Wow, Sam's dad.  Wow, this is a very impressive gathering. 
[03:26:30]  How are you, sir?  Just fine, thank you very much.  We get to see it live.  Yeah, he's been growing the handlebar mustache for how long, sir?  Since about 67.  67, yeah.  1967 with the handlebar.  That was actually 1867 is when I was in style.  Back in the day.  Right.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Did you give it a little extra twist today because you knew you were coming in?  No.  No?  That's how it always is?  Just combed it out when I got up.  Combed it out.  When you wake up, is it like when you have long hair and it's all in a disarray? 
[03:27:00]  It kind of goes the other way.  It does?  Oh, it flips into your mouth?  Yeah, it kind of goes.  Oh, that's good.  Does anybody ever say, did O.J. Simpson kill your son?  Except this time.  He's a much more normal looking guy than I expected.  He's in a suit and tie.  I thought he was going to be like kind of a wacky guy.  Yeah.  With his...  No, actually, I'm coming in to see my lawyer, too.  Oh, oh, oh.  Uh-oh.  Problems?  Hopefully not with us. 
[03:27:30]  He handles all the business for the barbershop quartet.  Yes, yes.  The banjo player was getting a little rambunctious and you're taking him to court.  So, he loves old school stuff.  Yeah.  Explain to Adam's tradition.  It's tradition.  Explain to Adam the greatest treats of all time.  Some of the greatest treats of all time.  What?  They're on my ass because I like buttermilk.  Okay.  He drinks buttermilk.  Buttermilk.  And buttermilk with crackers in it.  Yeah.  And there's nothing...  23 Skidoo, my friend.  It's not 23 Skidoo. 
[03:28:00]  It's downstairs in the deli.  Good for you.  And you enjoy that, but...  And sardine sandwiches.  Sardine sandwiches.  I couldn't look high enough.  If Doug wouldn't eat it after he smokes pot, then it's not that good of a treat.  Also, raw potatoes.  Raw potatoes.  Raw potatoes.  Not too starchy.  Do you have a bicycle with a big giant wheel?  Yes.  Somebody said that already.  Of course.  Every old thing.  I believe what's left open for you to joke about.  Eli Whitney's cotton gin. 
[03:28:30]  Trying to give Adam some thought starters here.  The Model T Ford.  The flying machine?  That's preposterous.  Have you checked out talkies yet?  I went to two.  They were good.  Double feature.  Yeah, so you are a little more conservative looking than I thought you would have been.  He looks very normal in person.  I'm a very conservative guy.  We had an image of Sam's dad.  What do you think of Sam's hair? 
[03:29:00]  That's his mother's side of the family.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Enough of the interracial stuff.  Wow.  Now, you then, because Sam told us about his illustrious history, are you the one that  is related to Thomas Jefferson?  Actually, I'm the only one.  It's my side of the family that could afford to do the whole genealogy thing.  Oh, wow.  So we have no idea what's on the other side.  Ah.  So you traced your genealogy back, and Thomas Jefferson is in your family lineage. 
[03:29:30]  And slaves, too, then.  Well, hence, his son's hair.  Look at Sam's hair.  We always have thought that perhaps back in the day, old Tom Jefferson was getting down  a little out the house.  Chicken Sam.  I was going to send him a book.  There's apparently a new book out called The Hemmingses of Monticello.  Yes.  So I was going to send that back to him and see if he did.  That is the black side of the Jefferson family.  It is.  I do believe.  What was her names?  Was it Sally and Weezy?  George and Weezy. 
[03:30:00]  Weezy.  No.  That's a TV show, Jimmy.  Waka waka.  My grandmother would hate when I would talk over that theme song.  I would do it just to annoy her.  She'd go, I waited all week for this song.  Ew.  It's the whole story.  The Moving On Up song?  Yeah.  She's a relevant old bag.  Put ice picks in her ears while she was listening to it.  So, and you found this out, that you traced that back.  And also, Alexander the Great?  No.  It goes, it goes all the way back to.  He's lying sack of shit.  No. 
[03:30:30]  No, it wasn't Alexander.  Who the hell was it?  It was the King, um, uh.  No, it was a King Kong Bunny.  King Kong Bunny.  Miles Standish.  It does go back to Miles Standish.  But the interesting thing is, once you get back, like, ten or eleven generations, you're  related to everyone.  What?  No, no, no.  We're special.  Oh, oh, sorry.  Is that true?  Like, you get back, you just start, like, mix and match, everybody's kind of...  Yeah, once you go back, like, you know...  Six degrees of fucking everybody. 
[03:31:00]  That's it.  Of Thomas Jefferson.  Wow.  So...  But the Thomas Jefferson thing.  That's pretty impressive.  And did you trace it back as to, was there any, um, uh, slave blood in your lineage?  We didn't go that far, or if we did, we conveniently left it out of there.  Oh, that's so wrong.  He stopped at that point.  Oh, I am outraged!  They burned those documents.  Conveniently stopped.  After the first conviction, like, uh...  We decided not to follow that particular...  All right, that branch.  Who needs to know?  Okay, and make your own joke there. 
[03:31:30]  I'll just leave that a blank.  Well, Sam, thanks for stopping and saying hi, man.  You're very welcome.  That's good.  What were you doing here?  Anything in particular?  You said it's the scene of a lawyer.  No, actually, I'm coming in to have lunch with a friend, so...  Oh.  Now, where is the traffic lady?  Isn't she a part of this group as well?  Oh, well, that, uh...  Awkward.  That could be a while ago.  You are out of date.  I'm older, so I can't remember.  I retired a few years ago.  Uh, do you mean, um, uh, the girl from 10-11? 
[03:32:00]  Yes.  Ah, yes.  Oh, boy.  That, uh...  She was the one in the closet.  Oh, no, no, no.  So I asked the one that was in the closet.  Did somebody answer for me?  Hello.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry.  No, no, it's okay.  Yeah, very awkward.  So our clothes, we got her some new clothes.  Yeah, take the mic out of his hand.  Because she, you know...  Well, that's good.  No, that's fine, you know.  Anything else you want to say? 
[03:32:30]  It looks like he's doing a set for us.  Yeah.  Right, right.  We're in a comedy club.  Yeah.  Thank you, gentlemen.  That's good.  Why don't you just bring up when my sister was going out with Adam?  Oh.  Oh, that did happen.  You know, if you go back far enough, we're related.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  That's funny.  Two generations, maybe.  Well, of course.  Sam's dad, everyone.  Sam's dad, everyone.  Literal Sam's dad.  Thank you, Sam's dad.  Thank you.  Nice stash.  Thank you.  We really do.  It looks better in person than it does in pictures. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah, it does.  Absolutely.  Kind of want to...  He gives the thumbs up.  Then he's going to leave and tie it one way to the tracks.  I'm going to clip the sides and have him go, diabetes.  Hey, Sam's dad getting applause for him.  Sam's dad.  Everyone's digging it.  He's a more normal gentleman than I thought, to be honest with you.  Good place to stop this today.  Oh, of course it is.  Adam Farrar, Gotham Comedy Club all weekend long, starting tonight.  Thank you.  Doug Benson's got all sorts of things.  Super High Me's going to be on TV soon. 
[03:33:30]  April 20th on G4.  Okay.  420.  And best day ever on VH1 tonight and tomorrow at 11 p.m.  Yes.  10 Central, I guess.  And your MySpace is Doug.  10 Central, I guess.  Doug underscore Benson on MySpace.  Doug no underscore Benson on Twitter.  Nice.  I got it going on, you guys.  I'm going to start following you.  I'll follow you on Twitter.  Things are happening.  That's how you roll, yo.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Is that it?  Everyone else good? 
[03:34:00]  Jimmy good?  Let's get the fuck out of here. </pre>
