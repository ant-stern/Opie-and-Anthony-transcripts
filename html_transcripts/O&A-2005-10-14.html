<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, Ben, Steve, Eric, and Danny, engaging in their typical vulgar and insulting banter.  Significant time was spent addressing persistent technical difficulties, primarily microphone and headphone issues, leading to frustration directed at the sound engineer, Eric, and his outdated equipment.  The show then transitioned to a critique of what they perceived as the Today Show's overblown coverage of New Jersey flooding.

The "Assault on the Media" contest, with No Filter Paul in the lead, was discussed, detailing prizes ranging from electronics to a studio visit in a hazmat or beekeeper suit. The hosts lamented the lack of Connecticut participation. A caller, Joe Shareholder, challenged Jim Norton's salary given his outside projects, sparking a heated exchange. Another caller, Kevin, reported a Prius recall, prompting discussion involving Steve's recently stalled Prius.  The segment concluded with a discussion on the structure of morning radio shows, including the role of a female co-host ("the hole"), featuring Steve's increasingly graphic audio clips of a recurring female participant and further technical issues caused by mislabeled CDs.

Workplace conflicts dominated a subsequent segment.  These included a CD mix-up resulting in Eric's temporary removal from the studio; criticism of Danny's attitude and potential departure; a heated exchange about the overwhelming dog odor in Poe's car, escalating to threats of violence;  Steve's increasingly disturbing "hole" audio clips; and a discussion about the suspension of three radio hosts for a helium balloon/kitten prank, contrasting it with their own risk-taking.  The segment included crude language and threats, with the hosts attempting to mediate.  The segment included Opie, Anthony, Jimmy, Steve, Poe, Eric, and Danny, with other staff members mentioned.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to reading and satirizing the biographies of George Lindsay and Linda Lambert, co-hosts of a Louisville, Kentucky radio show, using vulgar and sexually suggestive language.  This was followed by a phone call with Dale Schaefer, their station manager, discussing the fallout from their suspended kitten stunt.  The conversation was interrupted by prank calls.  The segment also mentioned upcoming guests Patrice O'Neal, and Laszlo,  Rob Dibble (who called in), Jimmy Norton's upcoming absence, and the show's upcoming anniversary party.  Humorous campaign ads for a fictional Bill Burr/Jim Norton election and Stephen Lynch's song "Kill a Kitten" were played.

A discussion about CES, video game conventions, and the media landscape followed.  The hosts discussed their CES experiences, focusing on "booth bitches,"  gaming, portable devices, and the music industry's response to digital distribution. Patrice O'Neal called in, discussing his sex life, relationship, and experiences with other comedians (Voss and Bonnie). Bob Kelly also called in, leading to a humorous exchange. The segment included listener calls, a discussion of a controversial baseball play with Rob Dibble's call-in, speculation on Howard Stern's show, and fake promo announcements including a fictional Christian radio station.  Plugs for Joey's restaurant and Paisano of Mulberry Street were also included.

The show continued with a discussion of the New York Yankees, featuring opinions on Joe Torre, Brian Cashman, and Alex Rodriguez.  Rob Dibble, a guest, addressed rumors of punching Stuart Scott, denying the punch but hinting at a kiss. Listener calls, some offensive, followed. Dibble then departed to prepare for his radio show.  The latter portion featured Big A performing crude stand-up routines, with Jim Norton present, engaging in banter and making offensive remarks.  Two female comedians were also present in the studio, initially waiting outside before joining.  The show concluded with more of Big A's jokes and promotional announcements.

[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zilcher.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Friday.  Friday. 
[00:04:30]  It's Friday.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Oh, mother fuck.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  Robin.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  Right, Robin? 
[00:05:00]  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  I invented everything.  Put a bandana on your car.  Serious sucks ass.  Mama.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Okay, terrific.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  It's Friday.  Friday.  Yes, it is.  You know what they say about that.  Thank God it's Friday.  Thank God.  Ha-ha.  Wow.  Why are you so loud? 
[00:05:30]  Let me turn it down a little bit.  I don't know what the hell is going on.  Because I could now...  Boy, something's a little screwy.  It is, right?  I have to really crank the headphones up to hear me again.  People are going to think this is the best of show because it sounds like a problem from the old days.  When we used to bitch a lot.  I can't really hear me very well.  Yeah, something's going on.  In the headphones.  Because you're really loud in my headphones and I had to turn down your microphone.  Yeah, because now I could hear everybody else really well.  I could hear you. 
[00:06:00]  But me in the headphones, a little odd.  And Anthony's so brilliant.  We've got to make sure his microphone is perfect.  That's right.  God damn it.  I've got to start the show by saying, wow, the Today Show got caught doing something.  What?  Eric, what are you doing?  Oh my God, Eric.  I don't even use that.  Holy crap.  Mix, mix plus thing?  Yeah.  That is...  No, I'm turning it one way or the other.  We stopped using this thing back in, I believe, 1983.  Yeah, yeah.  This mix mic thing?  Yeah, I don't use it anymore. 
[00:06:30]  No.  You just fucked up the whole flow on the first break.  You know that, right?  Have Mars figure it out.  You're pointing at stuff we're not even using anymore.  Yeah, it just doesn't work.  He's like, what did he say?  He goes this right here, and he points to this thing that they tried to install.  Remember before they fixed everything?  Yeah.  They installed this as like a remedy to my headphone problem.  And it didn't work.  And now it's just an artifact of XM days gone by. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And it just sits here as a reminder of something that didn't work.  And he points it out and starts trying to turn the knobs on.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  And I had a little point I wanted to start the show with.  It's raining here in the Northeast, okay?  It's raining.  And they're trying to take advantage of the whole flooding that happened in New Orleans.  So they're trying to get some dramatic shots.  Of course they are.  Of some of these flood areas.  And there's a lot of people.  There's a bunch of our listeners that live in these areas in Jersey. 
[00:07:30]  When it rains a lot, it floods.  The neighborhood floods.  And people get to floody basements.  And sometimes it floods on the first floor.  And they lose stuff.  Yep.  And it's a drag.  Uh-huh.  They basically live, you know, in those areas where, you know, the waters come in.  Where it floods.  It's not really a surprise.  They know that.  Yeah.  But it's been raining off and on for the last week or something like that.  I don't even.  It's been a long time now.  It is like Seattle up here in the Northeast.  It's just depressing and rainy. 
[00:08:00]  The Today Show starts at 7 o'clock with video from this Jersey neighborhood that's flooding, right?  Uh-huh.  And they got the reporter in a canoe.  Yeah.  This is the opening shot of the Today Show because this is one of their big stories today.  She's in a canoe reporting from the flood area.  You see the houses in the background.  You see the mailboxes in the background where you can tell the water's a little higher than usual.  A little.  Okay.  And she's paddling, dramatically talking about, you know, what's going on in this particular area in a canoe. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  So as the viewer, what are you thinking?  She's in a canoe.  The water's got to be?  Pretty deep.  Pretty deep.  Exactly, Anthony.  Deep enough where you would need a canoe.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, I misses that again, I think.  Maybe we should record that.  So I'm thinking the water's got to at least be up to the reporter's waist.  Yeah.  Or why else would she be in a canoe?  You know, a canoe has to mean that that's the only way you can get around. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  Okay.  We've been reduced to using canoes in the streets.  So I didn't get to hear the audio, but it looked like it was very dramatic as she's paddling slowly across what used to be someone's maybe front lawn.  Yeah.  Or the street in front of the house, right?  And as she's, you know, trying to make her point, two or three construction workers walk by her in front of the canoe.  The water, I'm not lying, is barely up to their ankles.  Up to their ankles. 
[00:09:30]  Barely up to their ankles.  They ruined the shot, is what they did.  Absolutely.  They ruined the illusion.  Yeah, because, you know, the news has to be dramatic and stuff, and they were going for the dramatic shot, and they got caught red-handed.  These three guys are walking by basically with their toolboxes, you know, going to deal with whatever they're dealing with today.  Just walking.  Don't need a canoe or a boat or nothing.  They walked right in front of the canoe.  Yeah.  The water's up to their ankles.  Way to go, Today Show.  They, and you know they must have gone through a big to-do before they did the shot. 
[00:10:00]  All right, get in the canoe now.  Be careful.  Now, you're going to row this way in front of this house, and I'll pull back, and you start your, the news.  And then these workers just trot in front and ruin the entire shot.  Amazing.  Make sure you have the angle, the camera, put it the right way so it looks like it's deep, but you're not actually seeing it's deep.  Don't see, don't show that it's just a big puddle.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, they're dealing with their problems down there, but the news, of course, it's their job to make it look a lot worse, and they got caught this morning. 
[00:10:30]  Why can't they do the news from the kayak?  Well, it's from a canoe, so.  But get the kayak, break down those walls.  Asshead.  Speaking of TV, how's our assault on the media contest going for October?  Who's in the lead?  I guess, do we have no filter Pauls still?  Is he in the lead, you think?  We haven't gotten any new ones in the last couple days.  He hasn't been banned from the contest, has he?  He should be banned from life. 
[00:11:00]  He means well, but man, what a dope.  What a dope.  He really is everything about the reason we left as a people and started our own country.  Get away from buffoons like him.  Antony.  Hey, Antony.  Here's his assault where he looks like a complete, I was going to say loser, that's not fair.  A complete psychopath.  Pat Conner joins us live from New York Times Square. 
[00:11:30]  Pat?  Hey there, Greta.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending his day defending his actions to make the threat public  and also to flood the city's subways with thousands of police officers and extra security saying  he would rather err on the side of Conksey.  Of course, many subways also being rather conscious today.  Reporters reporting countless abandoned bags and other suspicious items.  This bag found on train tracks in Midtown.  You could tell this guy was a national reporter because he was really smooth. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, smooth.  He just turned to the left a little bit like, what is that commotion as he's still talking and doing his report?  Yeah, he didn't turn around and say, fuck your problem.  As the one producer pops his head into the shot to see if the situation's under control, then pops back out.  Or if he's got to run in and rack some head.  Sure.  The video's up on opianthony.com.  But, well, No Filter Paul is in the lead for the Assault on the Media Contest for October.  I think we added some more prizes.  That's why I want to talk about this really fast here.  We have a portable Delphi MiFi radio we're giving away to the winner this month. 
[00:12:30]  A portable radio.  And you get a free subscription for your new MiFi.  One year free subscription.  Nice.  So you get the MiFi and you get the service for a year.  Dinner with our own E-Rock at Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  World Poker Tour Season 2 on DVD.  What's that about, Anthony?  Is that good?  Yeah, World Poker Tour.  It includes the Los Angeles event that I played in and didn't make the final table at.  You think you're in this thing, though?  I don't know. 
[00:13:00]  Maybe a long shot at your table?  I've never seen it.  It would have to be a real long, long shot.  I don't know.  You did pretty well in that tournament, though.  Oh, thank you.  It was a lot of fun.  You beat out half the room, no?  I think close to it, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And then a Ministry of Sound Stick Axe Music Mixer.  I have no idea what this is about, but it's one of the prizes for the Assault on the Media Contest for October.  You didn't take that home?  I think that was included in the box of electronics that they sent over.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I didn't take it.  I didn't know what it was, either. 
[00:13:30]  What do you do with it?  It's some type of controller device for your gaming system.  If I could be any more vague.  All right.  No, it's not.  Danny, please inform me what it is.  Danny is running in here.  Danny knows what it is?  Danny.  Sort of.  I just took a look at the packaging.  It's like a game controller, but for audio editing software.  So I said a game controller for your gaming platform.  Yeah, no.  I was being vague because I didn't know what it was, and you've come in and told me it 
[00:14:00]  is a controller for some type of audio thing.  It's like audio video editing.  Create music and video at the touch of a button.  Music mixing as it should be.  And it plugs into what type of platform?  Is it a...  What type of platform, sir?  I will say...  Oh, boy.  No, you don't know.  USB.  You came in and have no idea what it was.  Get out of here! 
[00:14:30]  And stay out.  And finally, Poe's car fumes got to you or something?  Yes.  Absolutely.  And finally, admission to the Opie and Anthony Show studios to watch the show live through  a glass partition in a beekeeper outfit.  Beekeeper outfit.  And then they have, like, asterisk, so you have to read a little more about this part  of the prize.  Yeah.  And submission to the Opie and Anthony Show studios to watch the show live through a glass  partition in a hazmat suit.  Why in a hazmat suit?  Because of you and your germs.  Oh!  Well, as long as they're on the other side of the glass.  That's okay. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What?  Do not fucking stare at me like that, Big A.  You completely frightened me.  He's a creep.  Holy shit.  Hi, Big A.  He's going to just stare at me like that.  Hey, that's cool.  Hey, could you shut the curtains?  No, just kind of lower that.  No, it's all right.  I'm going to leave him open.  You guys want to come in and watch some Opie and Anthony shows.  Oh, is he a creep?  He's scared.  The look he gives is really, really creepy.  He gives you like he's going to kill you. 
[00:15:30]  Don't look at us.  Yeah.  Just kind of look at him for a little while.  There you go.  All right.  Oh, my God.  You know how many women have switched seats in life because of that look?  Absolutely.  He's just gawking, and they're like, I think I'll turn around.  I like the booth side.  It's not even a bit for the radio.  He's got a really creepy look.  So those are the prizes for the Assault in the Media Contest for October.  The prizes are getting better.  Yes.  But we're not getting as many assaults from out of state. 
[00:16:00]  No.  Why is that?  We're getting them from our area, which is New York, Jersey, never Connecticut.  Connecticut has never participated in this radio show.  We've been at this for a long time, and Connecticut just sits there.  Wow.  No calls.  They don't do shit for this show.  I think every other state has come to the table with something.  And we get emails from all over the country now because we're a national show.  We get emails from Connecticut and Westchester.  Why don't you guys ever come and visit us and come by and do an appearance?  Because you guys don't participate. 
[00:16:30]  You don't help the program.  You do nothing.  Connecticut, you fuck-o-list.  You do nothing but sit there and enjoy the show, and you don't participate, and you do nothing to make the show better.  Nothing.  Done.  We're done with you.  49 states in the Union.  That's it.  Connecticut, fuck-o-list.  Gone.  Why don't you guys come and do an appearance up here?  No.  I don't know, because maybe we don't realize you're alive.  But anyway, we need more assaults on the media from out of our area. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  You know, the last great one was down there in where?  Auburn?  Alabama?  Alabama.  Alabama with the guy in the lion suit.  That was a really good one out of state.  Yes, it was.  Or out of area, I should say.  I guess it's harder because we get a little jaded here in New York City.  Every day, there's network news.  Cable outlets doing live shots all over this city, because it's New York City.  Right.  I would assume L.A. is probably very similar, but L.A. is really spread out a lot more area. 
[00:17:30]  It's probably harder to find a news crew to make an ass of yourself in front of.  Right.  Well, I mean, we want the Assault in the Media contest to really pick up for this month, November and December.  Right.  These are three big, big months for the industry.  Come on.  People are buying their satellite radios like crazy from now until New Year's.  Yes, Ben.  You're forgetting something.  We tried to go to Westchester that day on the bus.  Remember, we just skipped Westchester.  That was your idea.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck Westchester.  Let's just go right to Long Island.  And they're holding a grudge.  Yeah, well, it was getting late, and we were all hammered. 
[00:18:00]  What a dumb idea that was.  That was really a bad one.  You know, we come up with more ideas on this show than any other radio show in America.  I guarantee that.  But the problem is, some of them, some of them you guys don't even hear about.  Oh.  Because we realize how dumb they really are after we think about it for a little while.  And then some we bring to the table and actually do.  And this wow bus trip with a keg was just a disaster.  Oh.  And then they had us on Time Limits, and we went to Anthony's local bar in Brooklyn. 
[00:18:30]  We were supposed to be in and out like three minutes.  We were there for like 45.  We had about three Guinness there.  Let me explain for the rest of the country.  Wow.  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We loved that promotion.  We decided to really kick it off one year by doing a bus tour of the New York area.  It was mobile sticker stops we were doing.  We were taking sticker stops and doing them in five or six different areas around the city  and surrounding areas.  So we got one of those bachelor party buses, I guess you could describe it as. 
[00:19:00]  Right, right.  You know when you get a bachelor party together and you throw everybody on the bus?  It's like a little legit knee.  And in there was a keg of beer, all kinds of booze.  Oh, there was Red Bull.  Remember Sninky?  Red Bull, Jaeger, vodka.  Yeah.  Pot.  Sninky was drinking the vodka and Red Bull.  Pot.  Is that where we wound up in Long Island at the end of the day?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Billy Mac was aboard.  It started out all nice and fine.  We had about 12 locations we wanted to hit in an afternoon.  And we decided that, yeah, sure, we should start this at 2 in the afternoon. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Which is so dumb because rush hour around New York City is ridiculous.  Here's what I believe we did.  We went from the studio down to, like, the Trade Center.  Trade Center.  We gave out stickers there.  Then we went into Brooklyn.  Then did we go into Jersey?  No, we went to Staten Island.  Staten Island.  We wanted to hit all of the New York area.  Did we go into Jersey?  We went to Jersey City.  We went to a mall.  Jersey City.  Right.  Newport Mall.  Jersey City.  Then we went up north.  And then we cut back across.  And we were going to go to Westchester.  But then we decided, fuck it, let's just head straight out to Long Island. 
[00:20:00]  Well, that was because we were well over an hour to two hours late at that point.  Late.  We were all late.  People are waiting at these locations.  We're all late.  We're doing, like, phone-ins from the bus to try to do the show.  It was a disaster.  It was a total disaster.  We're all fucking smashed drunk.  And we haven't even finished yet.  We end up in a bar out on Long Island.  And, uh, Jimmy, didn't you take your ball back?  No, he did more than that.  What did he do?  He took his whole junk out.  He left a little of himself behind in the, uh... 
[00:20:30]  On top of the keg.  Yeah.  In the keg water.  Right.  There was a lovely lady that you, uh, had a relation with on the bus.  I don't remember a lovely lady.  I remember a fatty who had too much to drink.  Right.  And she, uh, might have given you some oral favors.  Yeah.  Well, she might have...  But she didn't want to, uh, complete the act by swallowing.  Can you blame her?  So she spit it into the ice water that surrounded the keg that, like, other things are in.  Bottles of booze and bottles of beer. 
[00:21:00]  But we, this bus trip was supposed to be stop, you know, hand out the stickers really fast,  jump back on the bus.  But every stop became, uh, uh, a thing with booze involved.  Yeah.  And, uh, some of the locations we stopped at, there was, like, hundreds and hundreds of people  waiting for us.  It was, it really was a crazy, crazy day.  And then we were going, you know, wireless on the bus, so the broadcast was awful.  Then we had to go to our, our cell phones. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  It really was bad.  And we were stuck in rush hour traffic.  Logistics were, were horrible.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, I just remember being at that bar on Long Island and getting so goddamn drunk.  So drunk.  And Jimmy pulled his junk out and put it in a girl's hand or something.  No, no.  He laid it on her leg at the bar.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  Weren't you standing at the bar with your junk just out?  With your dick out just talking?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all just hanging out at the bar talking.  There's a bunch of listeners around us.  You ass. 
[00:22:00]  And Jimmy has that look on his face like something's going on.  Like, what, Jimmy?  What?  And he's like, he kind of wants us to look down.  And there's his entire package outside his pants.  He pulled his balls and.  And he was just waiting for the girls to notice.  Well, no, I was leaning and talking to her, like, letting it brush against her jeans leg.  Yeah.  Just to make these guys laugh.  I'm like going like, yeah, yeah, no, I know.  We had a long bus trip and it's like, meanwhile, my fucking, I've got clear stuff on the side  of her jeans.  That was awful.  That was fun.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  Joe Shareholder just wants to be part of the show.  He's funny, though.  This guy's got a good sense of humor.  Oh, yeah.  Joe.  Hello.  Yes.  What do you want?  Hello, Mr. Hughes.  How are you?  I was wanting to ask Mr. Norton a question.  Yeah.  Um, Mr. Norton, um, when you go to pursue your other career, um, with your little TV  show thing, do you think, um, XM shareholders should be paying you while you're pursuing that  other career?  I certainly do. 
[00:23:00]  Well, why do you feel that way?  Who wouldn't?  Well, if you were an XM shareholder and Bob Edwards were to go pursue a TV show, do you  think you should pay his salary while he goes off for, like, two weeks at a time?  I certainly think he should be paid to not be on air.  Yes, I do.  Well, um, I'm a big fan of yours, but, um, I don't think that us XM shareholders should  be, like, paying you while you don't really do anything for XM.  I understand, but I also understand that this call is bombing so horribly that you had to 
[00:23:30]  swallow it in the middle of that last statement.  I don't, uh, think that...  I can never swallow it.  Shut up, man.  Excuse me, Mr. Norton.  You stink.  Mr. Norton, will you consider, like, giving that money back to XM?  That you don't even, like, plug XM when you're on the night show with Mr. Leno?  Uh, Joe?  Oh, my.  Yes?  Do you realize to be a star of this radio program that we have to help you along, and we've  decided not to help you along?  Uh, perhaps you're just not talented enough to make me a star on the program, Mr. Hughes. 
[00:24:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Well, I don't even have to answer that, obviously, so...  Perhaps you don't have an answer, Mr. Hughes.  No, I have an answer, trust me.  Anything else?  Joe, you're just not good enough, really, to be a part of the, like, regular people that  call, and we go, like, oh, here's Joe's shareholders on the phone.  Oh, plunk him down.  You realize one of our jobs is to carry you along and carry you through the bit?  You're not going to be the next big A or stalker patty.  It looks like Edson shareholders are carrying Jimmy along while he's pursuing.  Oh, you're still trying this, but it didn't work. 
[00:24:30]  Joe, we gave you the floor.  I gave you the floor.  And you fell off.  They gave you the floor.  And you bombed horribly.  You did kind of bomb horribly, and you can't turn it around and blame the hosts when no  one interrupted you.  You had the floor, and, you know, you slipped and cracked your little head on it.  It happened.  You had your moment.  Now it's done.  You were Joe's shareholder.  You were all pissed off.  But now, uh, it's not working anymore.  You know what it is?  He's like Triumph, where everything has to tie into a dog joke.  I'm going to poop on you.  Yeah, so now his new thing is trying to blame Jimmy. 
[00:25:00]  With him, it's going to be like a shareholder joke.  Right, right.  Like, I don't put stock in that joke.  Joe, cut it out, you.  I've done my share.  That's Rodney's red tie.  You're okay.  You don't have a hook, Joe.  I don't have a joke I'd like to try real quick before I go.  All right.  I'd like to hear the joke.  Yesterday, you guys were talking about the midgets.  Why do midgets love it when the stocks go down? 
[00:25:30]  Because they're always short.  Wait, why do midgets love it when the stocks go down?  Why?  They're always short.  Who is?  Midgets.  What's that got to do with stock?  Um, shorting of stock.  Oh, don't write.  All right.  Let's move on to other things.  Let's say hi to Kevin.  Hey, Kevin, what's going on?  You're on the Opie and Anthony program.  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Hi, Kev.  Breaking news last night on our local news. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Martini, Steve's car can stop in the middle of an intersection and get run over.  A big recall on it.  Yes, oh boy, everybody was bringing this up this morning in the office.  And if those cars stop in the middle of the highway, they become automatic ramps for other cars.  Yeah.  Because they're such aerodynamic.  You ever see the angle on the Prius?  Oh, it's ridiculous.  It's great.  Steve's driving a doorstop.  He can fly into your studio and it could just stumble out and fall to the ground. 
[00:26:30]  Steve's driving a doorstop with wheels.  Well, let's get Martini Steven here to talk about this.  Yes, this is one of the big stories today.  The Prius has been recalled.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  It's stalling.  It's stalling.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  Well, just leave it there until they can fix it. 
[00:27:00]  I guess they're recalled.  Yes, they've recalled them.  An electrical problem.  Here comes Steve.  Yes, we're walking into the studio today.  Steve, his Prius is about 100 yards away from the studio.  What happened?  We read about the recall and then it just stopped in the middle of the studio there.  Yeah.  This was something that I had to deal with a couple months ago, maybe six months ago.  Yeah.  I guess it's a short in this very complicated electric system that makes the electric engine  or the gas engine crap out and the electric engine take over. 
[00:27:30]  So it's an electric problem that makes the electric engine kick on?  It's a fuse.  It's a fuse that blows, I guess, because the whole thing is computerized.  The whole car is one big electric system.  How long can you run on electric?  If the gas runs out, how long can you run on electric?  Interestingly enough, this is how I found out.  It crapped out in the middle of Route 78 in New Jersey and I had to go about 15 miles  only with hybrid electric power.  You want to go about 35 miles an hour.  You pull over to the side of the road once you're off the major highway and then turn it 
[00:28:00]  back on and everything's fine.  But it was some kind of short and I got mine fixed months ago.  Saudi Arabia, don't go anywhere yet.  Yeah, please.  We're not ready to cut ties quite yet.  How far were you able to go?  15 miles or so.  15 miles when your gas engine petered out?  Yeah.  So 40 minutes later, you went 15 miles.  That's not an exaggeration because you run on 35 miles an hour maybe.  35.  Isn't that bad to do for your car though?  I wouldn't think the electric motor is made to drive that car for any length of time really. 
[00:28:30]  I don't think it was made for that.  But I called the dealership.  They brought it in and said, oh yeah, okay, it's this again.  Again, again.  Well, I guess they have to measure the amount of times it's happening.  I guess it happens enough for them to justify a recall.  A recall, yeah.  See, when they first invented cars, they had all these little problems they had to worry  about and deal with.  That's what they're going through with the hybrid cars.  They got it all figured out over time though.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Regular combustion.  Combustion, internal combustion. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That's what they're doing with the hybrids.  They got to work out the bugs.  Sure.  You couldn't do anything to that car, right?  Like any servicing.  Like changing the spark plugs.  I pimped mine a little bit.  I put window tinting and rims on it.  No, I mean like with a car, you could usually pop the hood as a man, get out the spark plug  wrench, change your own plugs, change your own oils, things like that. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, you can.  You can.  It's a little bit more involved.  It's not like a Ferrari where you got to pay $150 every time you want to change the car.  No, it's certainly not like a Ferrari.  Sorry, that was a horrible analogy.  Wow, we were all thinking, that thing sounds just like a Ferrari.  I couldn't believe when I got in that the doors didn't open straight up.  I'm like, what, Steve, what is this, a new model?  I walked into that one.  It was faster than driving in your Prius.  It's not a Ferrari.  It's kind of like a piece of shit. 
[00:30:00]  To a speedy motor car.  You can take it to a Jiffy Lube.  You can do all that stuff.  Yeah.  It's fine.  The one thing you really shouldn't do is put a whole lot of aftermarket stuff in it  because it voids whatever warranty.  Yeah, well, obviously.  What's the aftermarket stuff?  Like radios and DVD players and stuff like that.  You can put it in there.  Exhaust.  One of those fucking rad, like, big exhausts.  You know, that all the Hispanic guys use on the back of their fucking Toyota Corollas.  Yeah, exactly.  He puts you in those beaded seat backs and it voids his warranty. 
[00:30:30]  A spoiler on the back, maybe.  In case you reach the speeds of maybe 40, 45 miles an hour.  If you want it to sound like you're going fast, he actually has to put his head out the window and yell,  Vroom!  Baseball cards in my spokes.  Wow.  Yeah, but you can do a lot of stuff to it.  You can put, you know, all kinds of fancy radios.  But considering, like, this whole front panel of the car is a big TV screen with touch panels, you know, 
[00:31:00]  you don't want to eliminate the option.  It's like an aircraft.  They call it the glass cockpit.  It's just a bunch of video monitors.  Yeah, it's one big video monitor with everything's a touch screen.  So you've got your navigation system, your radio, your climate control.  It's all in one screen.  Is your speedometer digital, like, a video?  Not video, but, what's it, LED, thank you.  It's not a dial, like an old.  No, it's really, his dashboard is really cool.  I drove in Steve's car once.  You did.  You have to duck down while you're in there because of the angle. 
[00:31:30]  But besides that, it was a cool ride.  Well, no, it's, like, it's a weird, like, thin little panel in the front.  So I can see it just fine, but he couldn't see it.  But Oak couldn't see it.  No, I'm talking about just how the whole angle of the car is.  Anthony described it as a doorstop with wheels.  That's what your car looks like.  Yeah, it's kind of like a wedge.  Kind of like a wedge because it, you know, cuts down an air resistance.  Right, yeah, because air, boy, oof.  Yeah, exactly.  If you kid me, without that, you would have been doing 32.  But that special design enabled you to zoom at 35 right there on the old shoulder. 
[00:32:00]  Do you realize, I'm thinking, as we're talking, Steve and I drove to OzFest in that.  Yeah.  If that would have broken down on the way for me to interview Sabbath.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You would have.  Yeah.  He would have.  If you were smaller, I would have threatened you, but you're big, so I'm trying to be mad.  Yeah, exactly.  You notice his dashboard is, like, four feet, like, wide?  It's creepy.  It's like, you put something on the dashboard, you can't even reach it anymore because it goes all  the way to the windshield.  Yeah, he's got a yoke in there now.  Hey, Ramon, bring me that from the dashboard.  If it breaks down, he just puts the yoke over his head with leather straps and pulls it. 
[00:32:30]  All right, let's get Steve out of here.  We've got to move on to a bunch of things today.  Oh, actually, no.  Hang out.  Hang out.  We've got to throw you in the barrel for a little while.  Oh, boy.  Hang out for one second.  Joe, what's going on?  Uh, Howard Stern joke, and looks like your display was on the computer on, uh, Brian Wilson  on Amis earlier.  Oh. 
[00:33:00]  Wait, what's going on?  Amis is plugging you guys at the beginning of the day.  Oh, right on, man.  So, just thought you wanted to know.  Thanks, man.  A true friend.  No, I didn't just say rad.  Did you say rad?  Did you use the word rad?  Excuse me, Dave Renninger from Philly.  And, did you say rad, faggot?  I didn't say rat.  Band right now.  I don't think you should ban him.  Click.  Wait, you don't have to ban him?  With the click of my mouse.  Anthony, you can't ban him.  You have an option.  Yeah, you really can't.  You don't have an option?  You have an option?  You don't have to ban somebody? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  You can forgive him?  All right, one time this guy gets.  Just give him one more time.  One chance.  All right.  Are you going to, uh, maybe forgive him?  No.  That, no.  All right, you don't have to forgive him, but don't ban him.  Go ahead, go and leave.  I pardon you.  All right, listen, listen, listen.  By the way, Ope, I have some audio for the show today.  Oh!  You actually brought something in for the show today?  I brought something to the old proverbial table.  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  I swear, look at it, right here.  What is it? 
[00:34:00]  What is it?  It's a little audio from our friend Bob Kelly.  Oh, wow.  Okay, we'll do that after the break.  Our sad friend.  Rad.  Rad.  We'll do that after the break.  Um, we don't like doing this, but from time to time, we got to bring you inside, um, inside  the bit.  Oh, no.  We don't like doing this often.  Like, we had to explain the stupid comic bit yesterday, which just amazed me.  Absolutely amazed me.  But, uh, I guess we got to bring people inside the bit just to show how fucked up this guy  to our left is, Steve. 
[00:34:30]  What?  You are fucking out of your mind.  You know that, right?  I think there's a degree of mental illness with everybody on this show.  Everyone knows.  You know, that's a good answer.  Yeah.  I think, I think we work with a, uh, a collection of psychopaths.  I don't know why.  Do you really?  Edmund Kemper with computer skills?  I don't think I should take all the credit for the psychosis here.  So, but yours is very focused, let's say.  Sometimes.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  This show is growing every day, so what the hell.  We could, uh, walk people through this a little bit. 
[00:35:00]  We hate holes.  On the radio, we should say.  We hate holes on the radio.  Basically, in your, in your fine little town or city, you got that local morning show.  It's two guys that think they're really edgy and, and, and, uh, just, just telling it  like it is.  Right.  But to balance it all out, because they listen to their stupid program director and their  general manager, they need a hole.  The hole.  The woman that sits in with them and keeps everything balanced.  Doesn't let those boys get out of hand, because boys will be boys. 
[00:35:30]  Shut up.  And, uh, yeah, they're, they're cut from the same cloth.  It's the same gag every time.  The guys try to talk about something, they get a little out of hand, and she's got to  rein them back.  Come on.  Stop.  Right.  How many times have you heard this?  Come on.  Stop.  Guys.  I can't take this.  I, I gotta say, you gotta stop.  You know something?  She is too good at, at doing that.  No.  That is exactly.  No.  It's not funny. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  That is exactly what they sound like.  Even Howard Stern has a hole.  They're there just to balance out the program, to keep everyone under control.  For the ladies.  For the ladies.  Because the stupid general managers and the people that own these radio stations out there,  they're trying to get the female demos as well.  And I think you can get females, even if it's just guys talking.  But they don't, they can't see it that way.  So they have to throw some hole in there that has nothing to add to the program.  She usually does news twice an hour, the traffic and the weather. 
[00:36:30]  It's all boring shit that you can read in your own newspaper.  Some of the best Stern I ever listened to was back in, um, God, probably late 80s.  It was, uh, I remember one day, uh, Robin didn't show up.  She was sick or something.  And it was just like Howard, Fred, Jackie, and Billy West without Robin there.  And they went off, and it was...  You know, you're right.  Yes, I know.  And it was hysterical. 
[00:37:00]  Naturally.  Without that hole just piping in.  Oh, wait.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Stop it.  Shut up.  Oh, come on.  Exactly.  Now, now.  Hold on.  Why do program directors feel the need to throw in the hole?  I've been doing radio since I was 18 years old, and I, I could, I could name a million  radio shows, and it's all the same exact formula, the same fucking thing.  And all these shows are sitting in their little towns in their little cities, and some big 
[00:37:30]  cities thinking they're going to be nationally syndicated, and they're going to make the big  time, and they're just not.  They're just not, because they're not doing anything different than all the other shows  in America.  Now, and they, they all trade ideas, and, I was part of that fraternity for about, maybe  a year.  Ouch.  Not going to lie to you.  There was a thing called Bitboard, where you go on and, Bitboard, oh, my God.  And you, you trade your ideas, right?  And at, at first, it seemed like a good thing. 
[00:38:00]  I was, you know, I was just starting out, and I had some, I had some really good ideas.  I'm like, all right, I got good ideas, but I certainly could use more.  So, you share ideas with other shows across America, right?  I quickly learned that I was throwing up my, my best shit, and these guys just had  nothing in return that I could, I could use ever.  Every once in a while, you would get a, a wacky phone number or something for some guy,  like, lunch menu man, remember him?  Yep.  He was some crazy guy down south that, you know, did the lunch menu for the local school 
[00:38:30]  district, but he did it in such a way that it made it entertaining.  Yeah.  He was really bizarre.  So, you know, you would get stuff like that, you know, quirky things and weird phone numbers  and stuff, but.  Yeah, but it was like going to a swap meet with bars of gold.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, you're giving him out and getting like a hubcap in return.  And finally I bailed.  Crap.  And the guys that owned this thing used to call me and beg me to come back because my  stuff was terrific.  I'm like, yeah, I know it's terrific.  That stuff's great.  I learned I learned I don't need you guys and, you know, I'll just, I'll just continue building  a radio show without you. 
[00:39:00]  Was that like Prep Burger?  Yeah, they're, they're, they're still out there today.  I'm sure they're still out there today.  And, uh, but.  Battle of the sexes.  And then these guys get together for what's called boot camp.  They go, they go to a city and they just, uh, they just have sex with each other and get  drunk with each other.  And, and, uh, and, you know, all these morning, morning shows go down there with their holes  and they all exchange ideas.  And they'll have like a speaker.  Right.  That'll come up and, and talk about morning radio.  And they all sit there and listen and take little notes.  And I, uh.  Time and temperature should be when? 
[00:39:30]  Okay, let me jot that down.  Oh, yeah.  Let me jot that down.  Yeah, it's, it's been, yeah.  And they, they have all sorts of, uh, meetings and.  Yeah.  And, uh, and what's the word I'm looking for?  It's, it's, uh, you know, you, you get together.  Powwows.  Aids.  Yep.  But you get together in a room to discuss this topic and they have a panel and.  Forums.  Forums and stuff like that.  Uh, Anthony and I have been invited probably 10 to 15 times.  Eek.  We have never gone.  And then it got to the, to a point which was kind of flattering that just, instead of just 
[00:40:00]  going and being, uh, just another show there, now they want us to talk in front of everybody.  And, uh, we couldn't be bothered.  No.  Because they're just a bunch of douches that do these, uh, these morning shows across America.  They really are.  They really are.  Horrid.  So we picked up on the whole, uh, whole thing on this program, right?  Wait, can I say?  Yes.  When, when is the next one?  Do you know?  I think it passed.  They're usually in the summer, I think.  I think.  I, I, I already tried that bit.  I wanted to send some of our guys down to, you know, to record it. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, of course.  But, uh, we, we, we weren't able to pull that one off.  So, so we, uh, we've been going with this whole concept.  Mm-hmm.  You know, this, uh.  Uh-huh.  You know, you probably heard it.  Yeah.  And we, we tried it out for the first time on a, on a real guest.  Yeah.  And the guy was buying into it big time.  It seemed to work.  Big time.  So Anthony's, you know, trying to talk about, uh, sex.  So, you, you might have heard the bit.  It's one of the best bits the listeners are saying since we came to XM.  They really enjoyed it.  I'm sure it'll replay very soon.  Is it going to replay this weekend, Eric? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  It's going to replay this, uh, this weekend on 202 somewhere.  And, uh.  Oh, damn.  I was hoping to hear the Dick Cavett interview again.  What happened?  Jesus.  I don't know.  I've heard it like three times already.  Have you?  Oh.  Why is that happening?  I don't know.  It's that, it's that two o'clock replay or something.  Well, what's going on with the two o'clock replay?  It's what?  The same hours?  I just rotating?  I don't know.  Eric, what happens on the two o'clock replay?  Hawk, I'd hope you'd have an answer for this one.  We have, like, 50 different one-hour blocks that are supposed to rotate. 
[00:41:30]  Rotate.  From 2 and 11 throughout the week.  Is it on random?  Because you ever put a computer on random and you hit the button and five comes up three  times in a row?  Yeah.  It's like, wait, it's supposed to be a random number.  Well, it is random, but sometimes five will come up three times in a row.  All right, we'll check on it and make sure.  Well, who's keeping track of this?  I mean, is Don keeping track of this to make sure that there's a lot of variety?  Oh, there's pointing going on.  There's pointing.  Danny and I.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny, I hope you know more about this than you did that stick.  I absolutely do.  All right.  Is the material rotating nicely in the two o'clock hour? 
[00:42:00]  The material is rotating.  The problem is we run so much worse stuff on this channel per week that it's impossible  to, you know, not burn stuff out.  I mean, stuff gets burnt out.  It's just the way it is.  You know, I'm trying to build as many as I can.  That's pretty much the tough titty.  That was tough titty.  That was tough titty, you guys.  You run like 28 hours of worst stuff on the show.  I'm not disagreeing with you.  I think you're right.  Yeah, but we did.  I don't know, though, man.  We've been at this a year.  There should be a lot of hours, no? 
[00:42:30]  Well, there's a lot of chunks that were part of, let's say, worst of shows from, you know,  the last vacation that I don't want to reuse because then you have people complaining,  I just heard that stuff on the last worst of.  Yeah.  So it's getting a little difficult.  We just haven't been here long enough, really.  You think?  Yeah, a year really isn't long enough.  All right.  Yeah, and then if I play something from, you know, two weeks ago, it's like, all right,  they just played this two weeks ago.  Why?  But you're trying to keep the variety going, right?  It's tough.  All right.  Danny's trying.  All right.  Well, I shall flag that block and make sure it doesn't work for some time. 
[00:43:00]  We'll try to give you more stuff.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bob.  Sorry.  It's so hard to find funny shit in the last year.  Yeah.  It's tough.  Look at Danny.  It's tough.  You guys suck.  Sorry, I got to weed.  That's pretty much what he was saying.  He's trying to weed through Japan right after the fucking Canola gang flew over.  Yeah, Danny.  And I'm also being told to plug the official WOW sticker stop tomorrow in South Philly at  Fright Factory off of I-95 behind the Ikea.  Oh.  Where you can meet me and Nathaniel and get a WOW sticker. 
[00:43:30]  Wow, you guys are going to Philly.  From 8 to 10 p.m. tomorrow night.  You're going to do a little life partner shopping in Ikea when you're finished?  That actually was the plan.  All right.  Fighting over cabinet colors?  We'll find out how that goes on Monday.  Barbara, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I really enjoy your show.  My husband told me a long time ago, you've got to listen to Opie and Anthony.  I started listening to you on my way to work.  I drive like two hours back and forth. 
[00:44:00]  And I absolutely love your show.  And he's surprised.  He's stunned that I love your show.  And, you know, I agree with you saying about the whole Robin thing.  Because I used to listen to Howard Stern.  But ever since you guys came on, I've been dedicated to you.  And, you know, I just wanted to say that.  Oh, thank you, Barbara.  We appreciate that.  Thank you, Barbara.  Definitely.  All right.  They're coming for you, Barbara.  We do know that we have a lot of female listeners.  And we didn't have to do it the old-fashioned way like all these other morning shows across America. 
[00:44:30]  So we've been doing the whole thing, making believe we have a hole in here.  And we tried it out for the first time on a guest the other day.  It worked beautifully, right, Ant?  Right.  But what we found out was that we didn't have enough clips to go to.  I was hitting, I had like 20 selections.  Stop it.  And I started, I had to start playing the same ones over again.  Yeah.  And I was starting to get nervous that the guy was going to be on to us.  Because some of them didn't make sense where I, it would have been good if we had something  else that could have been thrown in and made more sense to the reaction to what I was saying 
[00:45:00]  would have been a lot better.  But we only have limited clips.  Just internet soundboards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So Steve went and got more hole clips.  Yeah.  This is where we're going with the bit here.  Oh, and this isn't going to be.  Oh, boy.  It'll work.  Oh, boy.  Well, I want to play the more hole audio clips that is in front of me.  But the CD says Pearl Jam, Ace Freely, at Borgata singing Keep on Rockin' in the Free World.  I like Ace Freely.  Let's go there.  Why not? 
[00:45:30]  Wow, that sounds really bad.  Right.  It actually wasn't.  It wasn't?  Yeah.  It's a long version of it.  But Freely jammed with them in Atlantic City.  It's like 10 minutes long.  Oh, God.  It's filler.  Well, where's the actual CD?  Is Eric running to get it?  Let's hope so for his sake.  Oh, Hawk.  Oh, my God.  Now we have to go in.  Why is that the wrong one, Opie?  I don't know.  Whose fault is that?  I don't know.  We need a fault.  I love fault.  Here comes Eric.  Eric, he came back in.  What is that, Eric?  I already said what it is.  This is the wrong CD.  He just ripped it out of his hand. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, no.  Not Ace Freely.  It's the wrong CD.  I already said that.  So why are you staring at the CD?  We need the real CD.  Hawk would like the real CD.  That's one track that's nine minutes long.  Back out.  Holy shit.  The guy's got to sleep.  The guy's got to sleep.  Weren't you getting emails from him at two in the morning or something?  Yeah.  Everybody does.  You get these inane emails from him at two in the morning.  He's the guy in the studio that has to run around, and he does a great job for the most part. 
[00:46:30]  But sometimes he walks around in a daze.  Do you got the actual CD?  The whole pops?  The...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had them right in front of you.  Right here, you asshole!  But the disc is wrong.  That's what I fucking said.  Hawk, disc is wrong.  Holy shit.  They're right in front of me.  Holy shit.  Are you fucking kidding me?  He did not just come in here and say they're right in front of you.  That's exactly what I just said.  Did I just say more whole audio clips? 
[00:47:00]  I'd love to play them, but...  He called you out, Opie.  He kind of pointed, like, they're right here.  Like, they're right in front of you.  The horror on Spider's face when he actually realized that it was an empty CD case he was pointing at.  He thought he was going to be a big shot and say they're right in front of you, asshole.  As he points to an empty CD because the CD that was in here was the one I just explained that I threw at the door.  The Ace Freely.  He did this.  Oh, what?  The whole clips?  Like, oh...  What?  The whole...  They're right there.  Right there, idiot.  Oh, my God.  I saw him call you an idiot right in his head. 
[00:47:30]  Of course.  He goes, they're right in front of you.  Right in front of you.  Look at...  And here it is.  An empty CD.  Crisis over.  As I wait for the real CD.  Crisis over, he thought.  It's right here.  Yep.  Jackass.  Now deal with that for the rest of the show.  Thank you, Eric.  Oh.  Eric, can you make a copy of this for me?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, poor Hawker's not happy.  Where was it? 
[00:48:00]  I want to know where it was.  Eric.  Eric, get Eric back.  Eric.  Why is it...  Everyone's running around like you just kicked an anthill.  Everyone's just...  Everyone's just running around.  Because you did.  But they're just running around like they...  Where was it?  Eric.  Where was it?  Where was it?  It was backed by Danny's computer in the office.  I was told that it was an old disc, that the new disc was here.  When I didn't realize that was the disc not in your...  Wait a minute.  When I...  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Wait, what happened?  When I realized that he didn't have the right disc, we went back to make sure that the disc 
[00:48:30]  that was in the back was the right disc and then brought that in.  Yeah, but...  So what was that other disc?  Don't know what that is.  How's Ace sound on us?  I haven't heard this.  So, knowing what you know now, whose fault was this?  Was it my fault?  No.  Thank you.  But it was right in front of him.  Yeah, you pointed.  Eric, who would you blame for this?  I want to blame someone. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, we need blame today.  That's right.  We love fucking blame.  We love fault and blame are my favorite words.  Who was at fault?  Who do we blame?  It's a miscommunication on a couple people's part, but I will take the blame.  No, no, not who's taking the blame.  Sometimes the innocent hero takes the blame.  You're trying to set yourself up like, other people are at fault, but look, I'm taking the blame.  I'm being the...  No, no.  I want to know who actually is to blame.  Yeah, who?  Oliver North?  He's not trying to take the fall.  Yeah.  The fall guy.  Look, I'll be the big man here. 
[00:49:30]  No.  And stay away from that shredder.  Yeah.  Anyone?  No, I was a good one.  All right, thanks.  Who is to blame?  You said there were two people that didn't communicate or something.  There were a couple people that didn't communicate, but you'll take the blame.  Who fucked up?  Who fucked up with fucked up people?  When I saw the disc, Dan said it was an old disc.  And then Danny...  Damn, off the starting line.  All right.  Dan said it was an old disc.  It was an old disc.  So now you, being led to believe it was an old disc...  Put it back.  Put it back. 
[00:50:00]  Dan, man, did you fuck this up.  No.  What happened, Dan?  What happened?  Well, I...  Who needed you?  This is all I know, is that I gave you two CDs with two track listings.  And five minutes later, I come in, oops, holding up, what's this from?  I assume, since I gave you the proper CDs already, that I had left an old CD lying around,  and that that was no longer the right CD.  So why that CD was sitting there unmarked with no track listing for Ope to hold up and  say, what is this?  I believe it's your fault, Eric. 
[00:50:30]  I never touched it.  And by the way, let me jump in here, too, because I saw more whole audio clips with the cue sheet.  On the piece of paper that comes with the CD.  And then I saw a CD, like Nathaniel just said, that had no cue sheet, but on the CD said more  whole clips.  Uh-oh.  So I'm like, all right, I got two of them here.  Uh-huh.  So I go, Eric, what's this?  Uh-huh.  And he goes, don't worry about that.  That's an old CD meaning.  Oh, but it wasn't.  And I go, what does that mean?  He goes, well, now we have an updated burn or whatever you said.  Which is what?  And the updated burn was Ace Frehley. 
[00:51:00]  Ooh.  Do you have New York Groove on that, do you, Hawk?  Because the thing is, there's a CD of drops that might actually end up being useful.  I don't want to blow up the spot.  Right.  And then there's the one that Steve made that we were going to make fun of him for.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  So that's why there's two CDs.  There's two whole CDs.  Yes.  Wow, Hawk.  It really doesn't look good for you.  Not looking good.  I think it's completely your fault.  I said it was.  No.  You said other people to blame.  There's a miscommunication, but I will take the blame.  Because I should have checked on it. 
[00:51:30]  Who was the miscommunication?  He wanted to drag them into the water.  That's right.  Just clawing at anything.  Drowning, just grabbing at people's hair.  Right.  You're not going to let them live?  Those selfish fucks that are drowning.  Let go and drown.  I didn't want to drag them into anything.  That's why I said I should have checked the CDs.  Are you sleeping at night?  Yes.  You're not.  I see Sex Bagel on my Instagram.  Because you're on my buddy list.  I see Sex Bagel all night.  Yeah, you're up all night.  The thing's still on, but I'm on my own. 
[00:52:00]  There's no away.  You know how when someone's not on for a while, the little paper comes up, says away?  Never away.  Always busy.  I'm not up.  We got emails the other day from you at like 2 in the morning.  That's right.  Who else is sending me those?  I went to bed at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  Look, here's the deal.  I know you work really hard for the show, but you've got to sleep.  I do sleep.  You don't sleep.  You don't sleep.  Does he sleep?  Nope.  He's getting man-to-man massages.  All right.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Problem solved.  I love when we get to the bottom of things.  Eric, why don't you leave the studio for a while and cool off, all right? 
[00:52:30]  Eric, what about the CD?  Oh, you want that CD?  No.  I just want him to come back.  I know.  Well, I was helping you out, you idiot.  Oh.  I get a little reprimand.  What happened?  Oh, shit.  Dick Cabot, part of Brand New Block, just made four days ago.  Buster.  Who wrote that?  I don't know.  In red ink, by the way.  In red ink, like, so fuck you.  Danny wrote that?  Did you write that?  Yeah.  He did.  You know what I got to realize?  Danny's starting to get really cocky.  Oh, he is.  I really noticed.  He is really stepping forward and saying, I ain't taking you guys shit too much longer. 
[00:53:00]  I got to realize one of the Ron and Fez have been calling me and I'm ready to jump ship,  so don't give me any bunk.  Well, I do have the biggest dumps around here.  He got a little rambunctious this morning, too.  We needed somebody.  See, it's raining here in New York.  It's been raining for a week straight.  And I do not like walking in the rain.  I don't have an umbrella.  I don't want to get soggy and sit here wet and cold like a little puppy all day.  So I pull up in front of the building and I phone my good friend Steve C. 
[00:53:30]  That's right.  And say, Steve, I will give you the opportunity to drive a real vehicle and take my Escalade to  the parking garage.  A real gas guzzler.  Right.  Exactly.  Uses like a year's worth of gas for his car just driving to the garage.  Exactly.  It's nice.  And Steve drives and parks the car.  And how do you get back when that happens?  Sometimes I walk.  Sometimes Poe follows me and drives me back. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, I would hope Poe would because it's raining.  No, he's been cool about it.  You have to.  He's been cool about it.  So today it's like, I don't know, the fourth day in a row or whatever it is.  It's the whole week.  The fifth day.  I didn't want to bug Steve because he's a busy guy in the mornings.  It's before the show.  He has better things to do than drive my freaking car around.  So I decided to make a decision today that Poe will drive my truck around.  It's a great honor to drive my vehicle to the parking garage.  It is something of trust. 
[00:54:30]  I have confidence in the people that do this.  That is why Steve is one of the only people.  And now Poe has driven my vehicle around.  But now what was needed was Poe to drive it around and someone to drive Poe's car to follow my vehicle so Poe can then drive back from the garage.  So I came up and I was looking for an intern or something to drive Poe's car because, quite frankly, I don't care who drives Poe's car.  They could drive it into a pole for all I care.  So, you know, grab anybody.  No interns.  It was too early. 
[00:55:00]  So in the office, everybody's doing something.  I guess the least important thing that was being done at that time was being done by Danny.  And Danny just started.  So you're saying Danny doesn't work hard for us?  He was going.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  That's what I heard.  At the time.  If we were doing bit triage in the morning, his patient could have sat there while the other patients were being worked on.  Good way to say it.  This particular morning, you might be right.  But there are other mornings where he's his top priority, you know, sucking chest wound is the bit he's working on. 
[00:55:30]  No, I'm not trying to get out of it.  No, I'm not.  You're trying to make something more of this than I am.  We all know we give Danny the easiest stuff in the morning to do.  How?  So why don't we just bring it to the table now?  Sits at the special ed computer at the end.  The one that doesn't have any real programs on it to do any real work.  Just keep hitting enter over and over.  Yeah, all you hear from that computer is, I'm contributing.  Yes, you are.  I'm contributing to the show. 
[00:56:00]  Because they made us hire a retard.  The reality is it's fun to make.  He really, Danny really works hard for us.  Of course he does.  Sure does.  Photographing his own shit and all.  Yeah.  I'm producing.  You certainly are.  But he gave a little bit of an attitude this morning.  Like he didn't want to drive post car.  Like it was like, yeah, all right.  Like you could say he was sitting there.  He's got his headphones on. 
[00:56:30]  He's hearing the conversation that's going on that we need somebody to drive.  He's listening.  No one else is coming to the table.  And he's sitting there like, I know it's going to end up on me.  I know.  So then finally when it was like, Danny, you know, drive post car, he's like, is there  a problem with your duties here?  No, not with the duties.  Duties.  Obviously not from the picture I saw.  It's like a fucking plane spelling things.  It looks like an air.  You should be taking shits over Jones Beach. 
[00:57:00]  My dumps, you could easily find, you could find the same thing on Central Park South.  That's a huge error.  But the problem.  Thank you.  Getting away with that one.  Wow.  He's trying to add to it and everything.  That's how huge they are.  But seriously.  And then he trods forward.  He wasn't even trying to do comedy.  Yeah, no, seriously, they're big.  I'm not really trying. 
[00:57:30]  Welcome to the bomb reel.  You got that one, Nathaniel?  Central Park, what did you do?  Central Park South?  Shut up, Jimmy.  I'm just trying to figure out.  Oh!  Oh, hey!  You're going to take that!  You're going to take that!  You got balls!  Sorry.  So, yeah, was there a problem with doing that?  No, no, the task is fine.  The task at hand is fine.  But there's a little slight... 
[00:58:00]  Eric is back in the studio.  Yeah.  There's a slight odor problem in Poe's car.  With Poe's car?  What's the odor in your car?  Dead bodies?  Is there an odor in your car?  Have people told you your car stinks?  Steve?  Nah.  Steve has never told me my car stinks.  Smells like dogs.  Well, yeah.  Oh, is that what it is?  Steve's a big pussy.  Steve can't even get in my car.  It takes him about 15 minutes.  There he goes.  If you really want to see how pissed off I can get, why don't you plant one right fucking 
[00:58:30]  here?  Oh!  And when your arm breaks, then...  Well, why does his car smell?  His car smells like dogs.  Yeah.  Oh.  What dog?  Plant what?  Yeah, plant what?  A fist or...  A smooch.  Because if I'm going to...  I'll get an anvil.  I'm not going to use my fist.  Yeah, exactly.  No.  Well, the big issue is I don't want to fucking club anybody.  I'm going to smash Jimmy in the face for making fun of me verbally.  What?  What?  No, I don't want to do that.  Let's hope not.  But why is this anger coming out, Steve? 
[00:59:00]  No, it's not.  We're all smashing each other.  Steve, relax.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  But you just plant one.  How do I articulate this?  Because I'm not retaliating physically, I'm a pussy?  Afraid.  No one's calling you a pussy?  Steve.  He just did.  Steve, relax.  He did.  That was the exact word that came out of his mouth.  He called me a pussy.  Hit him.  That's right.  And just because I'm not around here throwing people out windows means I'm a fucking pussy?  That's pretty much what I was saying.  Wow.  I think I don't agree with that.  Holy jeez.  Poe was the one who called you out, and I was just acknowledging the fact that it sounded 
[00:59:30]  kind of, you know...  No, Poe just said I didn't say anything, and then I...  Yeah, but you've been driving his car a lot, or how many times?  Every time I've got to park Ant's car.  Then you park his?  No, no, no, no, no.  Then I get a ride back to the studio.  Yeah, he's following, and then you've got to ride in it.  Every morning, I follow Steve to park Ant's car, and I bring him back to the studio.  Whether it rains, it doesn't matter.  I want to make sure that he gets back to the studio.  All the time.  Of course.  And he never complained. 
[01:00:00]  Not once.  No?  Not once.  Well, it's hard.  Not once.  Not a peevee laugh, because we have the show on, we talk, you know, about, you know...  You don't want to, like, say...  You know, it's awkward.  It's embarrassing.  You don't want to sit there and go, wow, your car stinks.  Unless you bring it up, like, immediately.  You get it and go, whoa!  This car stinks.  But after you've driven a while, it kind of builds up.  It's hard to confront somebody.  I don't think he smells it anymore.  I think he's used to it.  Are you, Steve?  Are you, Steve?  What, the dog smell?  Yeah.  I have a dog, so I know what that smell is, so...  You don't really like it, though, do you? 
[01:00:30]  No, it's not pleasant.  I know what dog smell is.  That's why I'm...  I got in the elevator and the whole thing smelled like dog liquid.  No one on it.  It's like, when they're wet, it's awful.  Yeah.  Wet dog people with their stupid dogs.  Oh, in the elevator, in their cars.  Exactly.  In your apartments.  In your home.  You're stinking it up.  Your basement.  Can we bring this back around?  Yeah.  First of all, Steve, I'm sorry I called you a pussy.  It's okay.  I don't like the fact that he yelled it up, though, and didn't tell Master Poe that he  should plant one.  Plant one.  Oh, if Master Poe hits me, it's going to be a rough fight, because Poe can probably do 
[01:01:00]  a number on me, but I'll get some good hits in.  Wow.  Yeah, your head on the floor.  Holy shit.  Maybe.  Maybe.  We're one wrong word from a massive fight in the studio.  Oh, it really is.  You can feel the tension.  I am so tired of being called a pussy.  I might just fucking...  Don't, don't, don't, I'm upset.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, it's like, listen, I don't mean to interrupt you, faggot, but I wound up...  Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding? 
[01:01:30]  Can I not talk?  I wound up being mad, man.  He no longer hates me.  That's all I care about.  I was trapped when I came in.  Now he's focused on you.  It's the weather.  I was sweating there for a while.  What?  Oh, he was mad?  Yeah, no, he's a little hot.  He gets a little hot.  He forgot all about me.  He gets a little hot under the slip.  Oh.  Oh.  But I wound up coming in in a very bad mood, and I think everybody has an odd mood today.  Yeah.  Steve, I have a great fear of you, by the way.  I don't want people to be afraid.  I don't want people to be afraid. 
[01:02:00]  Then I'm not.  Okay.  Whatever you want, that's what I'm offering for you.  When you come in that day with a high-powered rifle and start walking around, I want to  be the guy that you pointed...  I want to be the guy that's interviewed later that said, he pointed it right at me.  He thought about it.  And then smiled, nodded, and walked away and shot Opie right in the head.  I'm not going to shoot Opie.  Like, that's the guy I want to be.  Hold on.  Would I be the first one you shoot?  No.  Why are you saying that?  No, I wouldn't shoot anybody.  If you had to, would I be the first one you shoot? 
[01:02:30]  I wouldn't shoot you.  Oh, God.  In order?  No, if you had to.  You're coming in.  You're the disgruntled employee.  No, no.  You're coming in.  Who you shoot first, because you have that much anger toward?  You'd be first if Ben was standing right behind you and he knew he could shoot Ben by shooting  through you.  Because Ben is first on your list.  No, he's not.  Steve's going to give this order.  Who can fire me the least?  Who has the least firing power?  All the interns get shot first.  Okay, that's actually accurate. 
[01:03:00]  You have a room full of dead interns.  Wouldn't you shoot me first?  No.  Why do you want to hurt Opie?  Who would you shoot?  Who's first?  Who's first?  See, this is where you get the label of the P word.  You have to at least answer this question now.  I'm thinking.  The P word, what, Pam?  I'm looking around.  Who would you shoot first if you were the disgruntled employee?  I'd shoot Eric first.  Do I have to shoot people?  That's really the only option?  I'll be honest.  I'd shoot Eric first.  If I went completely crazy, came in with a gun, and just everyone was available to shoot,  because you'd probably just shoot the first person you see, you know, kind of make a statement. 
[01:03:30]  But if I looked and everyone was available to shoot, I'd probably just shoot Eric.  Nothing personal.  Just, you're very shootable.  And he's the easiest one to blame, because they go, why'd you do it?  You could just open your mouth, and some reason would fly out that was accurate.  But the CD had the wrong shit on it.  Well, that did happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, if I had to go in order of disgruntled employee, and your objective is to wipe out  as many of your co-workers as possible.  You don't have to give it that much thought.  Just, you come in, you're angry. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, because who's the one you're shooting for?  Well, the first person I'm going to see if I walk in with a gun is this guy.  Yeah.  It's Poe.  It's got to be Poe.  So Poe goes down first.  You have to take him out first.  You've got to take out Poe first.  So you can take out the rest of the office.  So you can take out everybody else.  But it's like, no, it's like a video game.  He's the boss, and he's in that room with the Kevlar and the bulletproof glass, and you  can't access him until you wipe out a few other people and can get them to switch.  Then you're going after stormtroopers, basically.  So you have to go out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have to go through a roundup.  Steve there with a fucking rifle and Poe just going, hold on, and then swiping in there. 
[01:04:30]  Who would you shoot first?  Who gets it?  Hmm.  Who gets it?  I guess, you know, it's a toss-up.  If Danny's in the way, Danny takes a bullet.  Danny.  Why Danny?  He's everybody on me today.  Well, you're in the room.  Everybody.  You're just the first person I saw.  I just shot Eric.  Yeah, you shot Eric.  Your name didn't even come up.  And I should tell you now that I so considered you first.  Why?  I don't know.  It just popped in my head.  I'm sorry, guys.  I don't mean to mess up this bit, but you won't get through.  What do you mean?  There's bulletproof windows and doors and walls and... 
[01:05:00]  Ugh.  Jesus.  Wow.  That was...  You missed a car crash.  It was a car crash.  Yeah, there's dog fur that's just flooded.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that was...  Would have been a great bit for another 20 minutes.  Oh, well.  We're done with that one.  No, it's all right.  No, it's all right.  It's cool.  So where were we?  Danny.  Uh, Danny, right.  With the car.  But, uh...  No, no.  Danny followed in Poe's car.  Right.  And then they drove back together. 
[01:05:30]  And Danny, I guess, had a problem with the fragrance of Poe's car.  It's a little funky.  A little funky.  Is it dog?  I suppose.  Yeah.  I suppose.  I know that Poe does have a few dogs.  Three dogs.  Three dogs.  Three dogs.  Three dogs.  What kind?  Bulldogs.  Oh, so they slobber a lot.  Big dog balls.  No?  They're just big.  Big dog balls.  Their tails poked straight up so their assholes rub on the seat.  You don't even get the tail protection.  People are amazing with their fucking dogs. 
[01:06:00]  They hop up on the couch at their house and stuff.  And their actual asshole, where the dog shit comes from, is on the couch.  And then people will lay there with their face on the couch, where the dog asshole was  just, like, rubbing.  That's okay, because it's dog.  Just put your face on your dog's asshole, because that's what you're doing.  My dogs have their own couch.  Your dogs have their own couch?  Yeah, they have their own couch, yeah.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Fabulous.  We're done with the car thing, because now we've got to go back to the Steve thing, 
[01:06:30]  which is the whole thing.  Right.  See where we go here?  See, in the end.  Thank you, gentlemen.  It all comes around.  Bye, Dan.  And then we've got the Jim Norton audio after the break.  Thanks, guys.  Danny, Master Poe.  So the whole.  Yes.  The whole thing.  The whole.  We're going to play the whole audio.  Give it, like, a 30-second.  Oh, wow.  Well, because now we've got new listeners.  Well, we have the whole audio.  It's audio of the women that are usually involved, the third person.  Of a radio show.  And they're the comedy kryptonite on a radio show. 
[01:07:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  So when we talk with the guests on the phone, we want to throw these things in.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Look, I'll say, you know, hey, a hole, why don't you shut up?  You know you're right.  Yeah.  You wish you'd hear that.  It has to be appropriate.  We don't have enough clips.  So Steve gathered up some more clips of the hole that we'll use in those situations.  Because you know the hole, right?  Yeah.  That we use on the show.  But part of his personality comes through. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, we don't want to know her name because she's just a hole.  I don't think she wants her name known either.  Oh, really?  I can't remember.  I think she might not.  She actually seems very cool.  So she did some more liners for us.  Stuff like...  Oh, Opie.  You know, more shit we could go to, right?  Oh, Anthony.  Very tame, right?  I know this is boring.  It's supposed to be boring.  You'll see.  That reminds me of something my old Uncle Al used to say.  This stuff will be radio gold when we use it again. 
[01:08:00]  You know, this reminds me of a funny story.  Which means, no, it doesn't.  And then Anthony would probably jump in and say, just shut up, hole.  We don't want to hear your funny story, right?  And that's where you laugh and laugh.  Oh, but guys, you...  Unless it's the story of your miscarriage.  Keep it to yourself, bitch.  Oh, but guys, you want to hear a really funny story?  No!  In the story cabinet, it's filed under K for kerplunk. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, no.  I hope he's all right.  So here are some of the new ones, okay?  Oh, gee.  I hope she's okay.  All right.  That would usually come after a news story of a woman injured.  You know what my mom used to say about that?  Sorry, go ahead, Anne.  Yeah, the hole would, like, chime in, things like that.  And that's what the hole does.  And these are clips that are authentic radio show hole clips.  Now, guys, let's not make fun of people.  All right.  Yeah.  There's just a couple more.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:09:00]  A similar thing happened to a friend of mine.  Oh, these are perfect.  They really are good, Steve.  Thank you.  I'm so sorry.  I'm just trying to help, guys.  Oh.  I just wanted to be part of the group.  All right.  So you...  Oh, they're really good.  That's when it started to shift.  See, now that's good.  And the whining and the, ooh, rejection thing is really good.  And that would probably be as far as we would ever take it on the air. 
[01:09:30]  Where I would get...  Because the last time we used it, which was the first time, I would yell.  Right.  I was yelling at the hole to make the caller uncomfortable.  Right.  At least we had on the phone.  And we really didn't have any responses from the hole getting yelled at.  Right.  And that's what sparked the next batch.  The next batch were responses to me yelling at the hole, which that would have been fun.  I'm just trying to help things like that.  Her whiny getting a little upset.  Right.  But, of course, Steve has to take it to the umpties level. 
[01:10:00]  I thought that's where you wanted it to go.  Apparently, I misinterpreted.  And you could see, and thank God we were just talking about your pent-up anger, because this really brings it to the forefront.  Yeah, it just shows your personality.  And it also proves you're not a pussy.  Who would ever call Steve a pussy?  Yeah.  Well, he did.  Oh, he did.  Kick his ass.  What?  Kick his ass.  You don't remember that anymore.  He called you a faggot.  He did, actually.  All right.  How could you not?  A couple of men just driving in that little hybrid.  Felt right.  A handsome car.  Faggot a little worse than pussy. 
[01:10:30]  Not really.  Oh, wow.  Pussy implies a fear.  No, because there's some jacked-up fags.  There really are.  Wow.  I had to work in clubs in Boston.  You had an answer for that.  Jacked-up fags.  Some of the biggest guys I've ever seen were when I was working in that club on Lansdowne  on gay nights sometimes.  You'd just see the biggest, bulkiest guys, and they were all queer.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  You can't argue with jacked-up fags.  Nope.  You certainly can't.  All right.  But this shows Steve's personality behind the scenes, because we wanted these clips, 
[01:11:00]  and he kept going with it with this hole.  Yeah.  Here's the first one.  No.  Not the tin snips.  No!  What am I doing to her with tin snips?  We'll play the next clip.  Not the tin snips?  Like, what am I, snipping off fingers?  Is that where it's going?  You notice how this has taken a drastic turn?  Like, it all worked up to this point.  It all worked.  Now it's ridiculous. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, God!  My fingers!  Like, what?  It goes from me just yelling at her to shut up, so now I'm cutting off her fingers.  Finger.  For...  Hitler and Goebbels, 202.  No, Dr. Mengele.  Those gold things in my teeth are good.  Jesus.  Oh, guys, I need my uterus.  Steve's writing all this down. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  It gets worse.  Listen to this.  Ow!  Stop hitting me!  Wow.  If that's not a tape replaying from childhood...  Oh, yeah.  If that's not little Steve C. in his room holding in a doody...  Little Stevie!  Oh, God.  He's kneeling with a log.  He's holding it in because he's afraid to go to the bathroom because mother and father  are quarreling.  Oh, he wrote these lines for the halls, though.  Oh, God, no!  Oh, Bubby Carleese. 
[01:12:30]  These are just like this one.  You know you're right.  Yeah, see how...  These are all nice.  Stop it.  Look at this.  Let me compare.  All right.  You got the nice...  Stop it.  You know, stop it.  She's still trying to be a part of the show.  Yeah.  She's a little angry.  Stop it.  Now it's this.  Oh, God, no!  What are we doing to her?  I don't know.  You leave that up to your imagination.  Yeah.  All right.  Welcome to the Steve C. video store. 
[01:13:00]  I'd like I spit on your grave.  It's in the comedy section.  There's a little chuckle.  A little chuckle.  Well, here's the new one.  No!  No!  Not the face!  Not the face.  Not the face.  You twisted motherfucker.  He really is twisted. 
[01:13:30]  So that's the cackle that we had, right?  Steve wants to add this to the pile.  Some muffled crying.  That is a post-rape shower cry, if I've ever heard one.  And I have.  Why don't you think he has that on a loop that he just puts on headphones and jerks off to that set? 
[01:14:00]  No!  Is he saying why?  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  It keeps going.  The poor girl's just trying to do morning radio.  And it's coming down to her sobbing in the corner in the fetal position.  A 30-second clip of her whimpering softly.  Yeah!  Try 52 seconds. 
[01:14:30]  52 seconds.  Of her whimpering.  Yeah, because Steve didn't think he made his point.  Yeah, you know she stopped after 10.  And Steve went,  No, you just keep crying.  No, I didn't run out of breath.  That was all her.  I just said,  I need some quiet whimpering.  I didn't, uh...  All right, all right.  I promise.  I'll keep my mouth shut. 
[01:15:00]  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  How did Steve's voicemail get onto the table?  Just when he thought it couldn't get any sicker.  Yeah.  What are you doing with that hanger?  Oh, no.  What, are we giving her an abortion?  Actually, that's not what I was...  That wasn't where I was going with it.  But then after she cut it,  I realized that's where it was...  That's kind of what it alluded to.  This is...  Not what we're...  We want a nice...  Like, stuff like this.  You guys have to stop. 
[01:15:30]  Right.  I gave you, I gave you like 13 of them.  Oh, come on.  That's a...  Yes.  Stop it.  Uh.  Uh.  Ugh.  Whoa, that one.  But instead, we got one more.  Here's the last one.  Oh, God.  I think my arm is broken.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Steve.  I held it together for 13 clips.  Wow, man. 
[01:16:00]  And then I sort of took a lift.  I'm going to change my opinion of you.  You scare me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened when you were young?  You scare me.  All kinds of things.  Why so angry at women?  I don't think it's directed purely at women.  Oh, yes, it is.  Do you think so?  Of course it is.  All right, so we got more whole clips that we'll add to our instant replay here.  And knowing this show, those will be added, and we will use them, and I will be breaking  a girl's arm as Opie presses that button.  We brought you inside the bit, and from this day on, we're just not going to talk about it 
[01:16:30]  until we use it someday.  So, there you go.  There you go.  You'll be in on the gag.  Wow.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  You're cool with everybody here?  You're not mad anymore?  No.  All right.  Cool.  You need a woman maybe to help you put a couch in the van?  I'm sure Jimmy didn't mean to call you a faggot.  Order.  Aw, look at you, too.  Aw, cute.  A little hug.  No, he's getting ready for the sleeper hole.  And, Eric, you all right?  Chokes him out.  Yeah, I'm fine.  You sure?  You're back in the game with us?  Yes, I am.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  All right, Eric's back.  Everybody happy?  Thumbs up from everybody?  The whole crew?  We're such a happy family.  Fans with that stereotypical thumbs up smile thing.  Yeah.  Rare and a go.  All systems go.  You can tell we're heading toward a vacation.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, we all get a little edgy when it's...  One week?  Yeah.  One week to go.  All right.  What are you doing after the show today, guys?  Oh, we're going to the...  Oh, where?  Digital Life Show.  Yeah.  Today, at the Jacob Javits Convention Center, from 1230 to 130, we'll be signing autographs. 
[01:17:30]  Are you coming, Jimmy?  No.  Why?  I'll go.  But you have to.  I just wanted you to ask.  You have to go.  You're on the picture.  I'll go.  That we signed.  It's a very rare appearance for us.  Especially all three of us.  All three?  All three getting together.  There's some lofts and lofts.  Look at the electronics.  I like that.  Actually, we were there last year.  It's pretty cool.  It's very cool, actually.  Do we have badges and stuff?  Badges.  I don't know.  You know what I hate about these things? 
[01:18:00]  You can't buy anything there.  You just look, right?  You just look.  Yeah.  What kind of pain in the ass is that?  You get free stuff, though.  I want to buy.  Free dumb stuff.  You get dumb stuff.  You know, you're looking at a wonderful video gaming system, and they'll hand you a keychain.  Yeah.  Ooh.  That really makes up for the fact that I can't buy this.  All right.  I want a $100,000 80-inch plasma television.  Where can I pick one up, Opie?  Shit.  A boy could dream.  A lot of people want to talk about bad boy Bubby. 
[01:18:30]  Bubby.  We'll talk about that when we get back as well.  But if you're in the New York area, Manhattan especially, it's today after the show, 1230  to 130, Jacob Javits Convention Center.  And then I think Ron and Fez are going to be there after us, so we might all just hang  for a little while.  We'll see how it goes, okay?  We'd love to see it today.  This is another news team.  A scary news team.  Evacuation route chaos.  Not enough help on the way. 
[01:19:00]  Skating rinks become morns.  It's a harsh reality.  But if catastrophe strikes, the base gate is not prepared.

[01:19:30]  Ben can help me out on that.  He did weather, and all of a sudden they made him this important reporter.  Ha, ha, with a...  George Shortsleeve.  That's funny.  Yes.  Joined by weatherman Bob Cufflinks.  Omar Overall for the sports.  All right, let's get on to the next news piece.  Warning.  The beverage you are about to enjoy is hot.  Warning.

[01:21:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program, the O&A virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio, and thanks to you for spreading the word to your friends.  And family.  Right.  To the fellow truckers.  I have a radio prank gone bad story.  It's not really gone bad, but people are suspended and there's like a hole involved.  You can tell this show is just one that we were absolutely just talking about. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  This one I got off of FARC.com, our friends over at FARC.  Radio 1, Louisville today, announced that WXMA morning team Lambert and Lindsay, consisting of George Lindsay and Linda Lambert and Aaron Miller, were suspended indefinitely without pay for a radio prank gone sour.  Linda Lambert, I guess, is the hole in that one.  George Lindsay.  Is that George Lindsay of the old Andy Griffith show? 
[01:22:30]  Was his name George Lindsay?  It was the guy that played...  You don't remember?  Holy shit.  I'm just trying to figure out if it's him.  And you know what's funny about that?  Jimmy and I looked at each other like the fake...  Like it might come to me.  Like...  Yeah, I think...  Wasn't he like Goober's brother or something?  Dude, I don't even know Barney Fife's real name.  Who is George...  George Lindsay was a...  He played a character... 
[01:23:00]  Who was it?  On Andy Griffith.  On Mayberry.  Yeah.  Oh.  Kevin might know.  Kevin's good at this stuff.  Yeah.  It's before my time.  Well, it's before my time, too.  But there are things called reruns.  There's something called Nick at Night and TV Land.  There's also something called...  You don't have to remember everything.  Yeah.  I know.  There's something called just sit back and enjoy the show.  Television is just one of those things.  You don't have to recall just knowing the main characters.  No.  It's the names. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, my God.  You're like Rain Man with this stuff.  I've got to kind of know some of the names.  Anyway.  Yeah.  I don't know if it is him or not, but...  Prank on Sour.  The three radio personalities performed a bit on the morning of Thursday, October 13th,  detailing the search for a kitten named Skittles that had supposedly been lost in a basket  tied to helium balloons.  The morning team began the prank with a science fair experiment involving a GPS cell phone  that was to be lifted into the air and tracked via computer. 
[01:24:00]  The kitten, they claimed, jumped into the basket with the GPS phone and lifted off into the  skies of eastern Louisville.  None of this actually happened.  There was no experiment.  There was no lost kitten.  But upset listeners jammed the phone lines at Radio 1, resulting in the suspension.  Most felt that the humor about a kitten in peril was not funny.  Many were late for work as they drove around the eastern part of the county searching for  the kitten.  Oh, my God.  A decision about the morning team's return to the airwaves will be made by a station management. 
[01:24:30]  Boy, if they can't get away with that.  Imagine the restrictions they have on them.  What company is it that runs them?  Radio 1.  Radio 1.  Louisville.  Radio 1's, yeah.  WXMA.  Lambert and Lindsay in the morning.  They should be suspended for just doing hacky radio.  Yeah.  That's one of the oldest radio bits going.  We got a kitten seems to be loose here in a basket with helium balloons.  Let's go inside this bit a little bit, okay? 
[01:25:00]  Okay.  This is where I love to show my knowledge of the business.  Let's dissect it.  This morning show did not have the balls to put the kitten in to begin with.  What?  Wait.  Are you saying they should have actually...  Where's the hole?  No, she's got to tell you no.  Oh, man.  No, I'll say it.  No, I'll be.  It's a kitten.  Think about it, though.  There's a meeting going on.  We got an idea.  This idea is going to get people talking in our radio market.  Well, what's the idea?  Well, we're going to set a little basket loose with the GPS or whatever. 
[01:25:30]  GPS phone.  Phone.  And helium balloons.  And we're going to track.  It's going to be fun.  People are going to be tracking it on the internet.  Boring.  But here's the deal.  We're going to say that a kitten jumped in at the last second.  Right.  But they should have just went on the air and said, we're going to put a kitten in a basket  and float it around.  And then we'll track the kitten on the internet.  That would get people talking.  But they couldn't even commit to the bit to actually have the kitten to begin with. 
[01:26:00]  They had to make it sound like it jumped in at the last second.  It would be fun.  To take away the responsibility for the morning show.  Wow.  Oh, I didn't even realize that part of it.  You're right.  That's what I hate about these fucking morning shows.  They do this fake edgy shit, but they don't want to actually take the chance.  Accidentally.  Anthony and I and Jimmy, because Jimmy's been with us a long time now too, we have taken  ridiculous chances on this show.  We've been smacked in the face.  We've been smacked in the face hard.  We've been fired twice, but it's gotten us places. 
[01:26:30]  We've been in jail.  We've been in jail a few times.  Well, not me.  By we, we mean Jimmy.  That's right.  But we've taken crazy chances because we're actually doing these bits.  These people want to be edgy and stuff, but they don't want to commit and have any type  of consequence.  It would be fun to say that you're putting the GPS phone and the kitten in as, and the  kitten is like the monkey astronauts of old.  But you're not saying that.  And you're tracking the kitten.  Yeah, but you, how you would do this bit if you want to do this in one of these dumb 
[01:27:00]  markets, you, you, you play naive, like you're not trying to hurt the kitten.  You're just doing an experiment, but you want to do it with the kitten like they did with  the monkey.  Sure.  But you, you, you claim that you're, you're not trying to hurt the kitten.  Yeah.  But then the listeners are like, no, holy crap, the kitten is in danger.  It puts more importance on tracking that cell phone when you think there's a kitten in it.  Right.  You keep just saying about, we're just want to track the kitten.  We want to like, you know, follow it on the internet.  You don't go on the air like a sick fuck and go, Hey, and hopefully the kitten will jump 
[01:27:30]  out when it's 200 feet above the city.  How did they do it?  I would love to hear like, and there it goes.  Oh no, a kitten's jumped in the basket.  Like it was probably bad acting.  I think the kitten's in the basket.  Hey, I think they better grab that balloon.  You better get that kitten.  Exactly.  Put the fucking kitten in the basket.  Put the fucking kitten in the basket.  So they got the whole town talking, but it's, but it's, but it's, but it's, but it's 
[01:28:00]  hack radio.  Who was driving around looking for it?  What a bunch of nerds.  Oh, wouldn't it be great if they were just driving, two people driving in opposite directions,  like toward each other, looking up out of their windshield, trying to find it and just  smashed into each other right through the windshield.  It was fat women in minivans.  This is, this is a new term we started a couple of days ago.  It's called fat housewife radio.  And I was on the road looking for the kitten.  I find nothing funny about what you've done. 
[01:28:30]  I think they should be fired.  I spent time, I missed work looking for that kitten.  You know, how many phone calls, how many of those phone calls came in?  Fat housewife radio.  That's the new term for this dumb radio.  Well, it's not George Lindsay from Mayberry.  First of all, you got to see this fucking horrendous.  It's Bob Kelly twice and fucking, and Tim Curry from Rocky Horror Show.  That is a tranny if I've ever seen one. 
[01:29:00]  It's Frankenfurter.  Oh my God, here's their bio.  This is why we can't be bothered with anyone else in regular radio.  Just when you thought it was safe to turn on the radio.  Just when you thought it was safe to turn on the radio.  Yeah, because they're just like the Opie and Anthony program with abortion jokes and stuff.  Well, we lost our cat.  Well, how about that?  Let me read this bio.  Of the Lampert-Lindsey show? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, they're on a station called the Max, so they have to be talking.  Wow, the Max!  The Maximum Mix from the 90s and today.  Is it safe to turn the radio on?  It's like that Doppler thing.  Yeah.  It's still a fucking radar.  Is 102.3 around the country just like the worst station in every market?  I don't believe BAB was cool.  I don't know what they're doing now, but...  Wait, did you get this off their site?  Yeah.  Because, again, look at this.  There's something very subtle at the end of every sentence, which is just horrendous writing once again. 
[01:30:00]  What, the exclamation point?  At the exclamation point, Jim loves...  At the end of every sentence.  Jim loves reading things with exclamation points.  All right, so, Jim, why don't you read the bio for Lampert-Lindsey.  Lampert-Lindsey.  Lampert-Lindsey.  Lampert-Lindsey.  Lampert-Lindsey.  Just when you thought it was safe to turn on the radio...  Now, there's three dots.  So, just when you thought it was safe to turn on the radio...  It's the Lampert-Lindsey Morning Show!  Start your morning smart! 
[01:30:30]  Why is there an exclamation point after start your morning smart?  Should there be an exclamation point?  No, it's start your morning smart, but this is start your morning start!  Smart!  Smart!  I got excited!  That's what happens!  Exclamation point.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's start smart.  All right.  Tune in weekdays with Louisville's fastest-growing morning team!  They're the fastest-growing morning team! 
[01:31:00]  Just yell off Mike a little, because...  I'm sorry.  I'm right in there.  I'm probably feeding back.  I get excited.  I can't help it.  This is how it is in my head.  Exclamation points.  I'm just trying to help the listeners, because we get a lot of email that we kill them when  we start screaming right directly into the mic.  Well, I'll do it.  I'll read it better.  All right.  Join Linda Lampert, George Lindsay, and Aaron Miller for a great time starting at 5.30 a.m.  every weekday.  You'll cruise through the morning with big laughs, great music, and all the news, weather and  traffic you need.  Weather and traffic every ten minutes! 
[01:31:30]  No station has more weather and traffic in the mornings!  No station!  That's because of the exclamation point.  Of course.  Of course.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  All right.  If you're tired of boring music and boring DJs, you're sick of the same parody songs over  and over, and you want to have fun in the mornings with a live local morning show, then  there's really nowhere else to go but the Lampert and Lindsay morning show on 102.3 The Max!  You really have to scream that, because that's four exclamation points. 
[01:32:00]  You didn't read it right.  Wow.  Look at that at the end.  They put four.  There's really nowhere else to go but the Lampert and Lindsay morning show on 102.3 The Max!  Nowhere else to go!  That is exciting.  Don't you do it!  Don't!  Don't!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  Oh, how atrocious is that bio? 
[01:32:30]  All right, listen.  There's Eric in Colorado.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Hawkman.  Hey, there's like three or four stations out here in Colorado who have done that same bit  in the last year, and the one even got their traffic reporter and a helicopter involved  in it.  And fucking nothing happened to them.  It sounds to me like this radio station is just way overblown on things.  Yeah, no, they're suspending the host.  It'll get a little press, and then it helps the ratings.  That's all.  That's all this is.  But it's hacky radio.  They're not really taking any chances. 
[01:33:00]  It's a bit that's been done by many other morning shows across America.  It's not even original.  Tell them, Fred.  Yeah.  The one station out here that did it, they didn't tell people that it was, you know,  an old bit until like two days later.  Right.  The old kitten gag.  They went on like it was a real thing all day.  We're getting phone calls from all over America saying local shows have done this in their markets.  Do you think they're just on vacation, like the fake suspension?  Oh, the fake suspension is great in regular radio. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, when the jocks take vacation, they do something beforehand to make it look like they were suspended  because that's edgy, and you want to listen to the suspended jock.  Wow, he got suspended.  He's got to be good.  I'm listening.  We got suspended so many times in Boston.  It wasn't.  And we had to listen to people going, oh, yeah, you really got suspended.  Like, no, really.  If this was a fake suspension, why wouldn't I be on vacation?  Right.  Why would I be in this office getting yelled at for three straight days? 
[01:34:00]  Let's go to Mike in Kentucky.  But, guys, it's time to confess that there was just a lot of vacation time built up at  infinity, and there was 26 months coming.  All right, that one.  We did have two years of vacation time.  Mike in Kentucky, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  You're sitting here saying that they weren't edgy enough, and I'll give it to you.  That's stupid, what they did.  That's just hacky.  Right.  But if they're not big names like you guys were in Boston and like you were in New York, 
[01:34:30]  then if they get fired, I mean, what do they have to rely on?  Because nobody knows.  I live like 20 minutes away from Louisville, and I don't even know who the fuck they are.  Then be the pussies you are and stop making believe you're doing edgy radio.  Shut your trap and play the stupid seven songs in a row.  And do your dumb traffic and weather, and talk about your boring lives at home, and that's it.  Don't make believe you're something you're not.  Anthony and I were working in Worcester, Massachusetts when we blew up our careers and got fired for the mayor's prank. 
[01:35:00]  We weren't that big.  We were starting to get big in the area, of course, but we weren't big in radio in general.  But we took chances.  It was the way we played it.  Yeah, see, that makes sense.  There's a lot of guys out there that are doing this fake, we're taking chances bullshit.  And you know what, dude?  You've got to be, and this is before I came on when they did this, but the fact is, you've got to be funny, too.  You've got to be good at what you do.  And if you suck at what you do and you're just trying to play like you're edgy, no one cares about you.  Right, right.  If you have real talent and you get in these situations and you get fired, radio was set up.  I don't really know what's going on in regular radio these days. 
[01:35:30]  I know it really sucks, and I feel bad for a lot of guys out there.  But it used to be, if you had talent and you got fired, you got picked up immediately because you were talented.  So we got a statement from the station manager of this radio station.  Yeah, but now I want to know, was this taken from their website?  Where did this come from?  Someone ran it in, I don't know.  Because there's a picture on the statement of a kitten in a little basket with a balloon over it. 
[01:36:00]  This is from the website.  The website.  See, now this leads me to believe the whole thing, even the suspension, is fake.  Of course.  Because if the station manager was apologizing in a statement, you would not put a little picture of a cute little, and it is adorable, little kitten in a basket floating away.  Look at his paws, Anthony, hanging out of the basket.  Because that's making light of the whole thing.  Right.  You know, with a picture.  All right, you want to read the statement, Anthony? 
[01:36:30]  The following is a statement issued by Radio 1 Vice President General Manager, Dale Schaefer.  Wait, wait, I'm sorry, you forgot to read the top line.  Important news from WXMA station manager.  That's not read correctly.  No, that's not read correctly.  Important news.  Hold on, let Jimmy read it like it's supposed to be read.  Jimmy, if you would read the headline.  I'm sorry, Ann Fungle, the headline.  Well, Jimmy is the expert on exclamation points.  That's what we're getting at here.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  This is important news from the WXMA station manager.  Right.  There you go.  Thank God there's no more exclamation points in this. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I just had to scream the whole thing.  The following is a statement issued by Radio 1 Vice President General Manager, Dale Schaefer.  This is Dale Schaefer, Vice President and General Manager for Radio 1 Louisville.  I'd like to take a moment to address what happened Thursday morning on the Limbert and Lindsay show.  During the show, George, Linda, and Aaron led everyone to believe that a cat named Skittles,  little Skittles,  had mistakenly been launched into the skies above Louisville during a poorly planned science project. 
[01:37:30]  I feel it is my responsibility to let our loyal listeners know that this whole escapade was a hoax.  There was never a cat helplessly afloat above the city.  As a faithful cat owner of more than 20 years,  I would like to apologize on behalf of Radio 1, the Max, and Lambert and Lindsay.  As a result of this stunt, the Lambert and Lindsay show is suspended from the airwaves without pay indefinitely.  Oh, it's a piece of hair.  Shit. 
[01:38:00]  Sorry.  Suspended without pay indefinitely.  Radio 1 supports the humane treatment of animals  and will not tolerate even the hint of irresponsible behavior where animals are concerned.  There wasn't even a hint.  It was fake.  We here at Radio 1 now hope to move on from this unfortunate incident.  We hope you will continue to listen to the Max,  and thank you for your faithful support.  They're on vacation.  And then there's a picture of the cat.  They're on vacation.  They're so on vacation.  We'll be back in a week, fellas. 
[01:38:30]  This is a fake, bad radio gag.  Hey, we'll suspend you.  I bet you they're a funny show, though, man.  I bet you there's a lot of laughs on that show.  Sing the monkey song, Claire.  Hey, Claire.  When I say monkey song, you monkey song.  I'm no kin to a kitten, na-na-na.  Na-na-na.  A kitten's no kin to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  That just makes...  Ugh.  That's just...  The oldest gag in the book.  Yep. 
[01:39:00]  They're pulling down there in Louisville.  All right.  Oh, yeah, you want to get into this Bush thing,  scripting, uh...  Scripting, uh, what, his speech with the troops?  Oh, wow, yeah, that is, uh...  That's a big story, actually.  That's a little much.  What happened?  Oh, wait, we got more WXMA promotions.  Oh, nice.  You want to read the, uh, the headline, Jimmy?  Because there's an exclamation point.  Oh, my throat hurts.  All right.  There's, there's four of them, by the way.  Wow. 
[01:39:30]  W, uh, XMA promotions.  Shoes day!  It's Shoes day.  Shoes day?  Like, like how you would say Tuesday, only it's shoes.  Let me do it as a radio announcer.  Starting next week, 102.3, the Max is overhauling the calendar.  We're taking Tuesday and Thursday off the calendar  and replacing them with Shoes day and Purse day.  Oh, my God, stop it.  Wow.  So, Thursday is Purse day, and Tuesday is Shoes day. 
[01:40:00]  It continues.  So, your new weekly calendar would be Monday, Shoes day,  Wednesday, Purse day, and Friday.  Next week, you'll win $100 in free shoes all day on Tuesdays.  But Tuesdays is Shoes days.  Yeah.  So, why would they say $100 in free shoes all day on Tuesdays?  All day, they should say on Shoes days.  Because they already said Tuesdays are now Shoes days.  All right.  Next week, you'll win $100 in free shoes all day on Tuesdays, 
[01:40:30]  and $100, $100 purses all day Thursdays.  Shoes days and Purse day.  From 102.3, the Max!  Oh, wow.  Is that the most horrid promotion?  Dude, if I was doing regular radio, and I had to do this promotion,  I would shoot myself live on the air.  Of course.  That's what I would do.  Well, they forgot the next promotion to honor her.  It's going to be Shoes day and Thursday, but it's also going to be cunt day.  That's the first day.  Cunt day, Shoes day, Wednesday, Thursday.  And then what's the other WXMA promotion they're doing? 
[01:41:00]  Jimmy, what is that headline?  It looks like a haunted house contest!  That's right, Jimmy.  Is your house haunted?  102.3, the Max and the Louisville Ghost Hunters Association are going to go to the most haunted house in Kentuckiana.  Kentuckiana?  Write us a paragraph and tell us about your house, and we'll pick one house to win a free paranormal investigation from Louisville Ghost Hunters. 
[01:41:30]  Holy shit.  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  That's a bad promotion.  Shoes day.  Do you think the listeners call up?  Happy Shoes day.  Happy Shoes day to you.  Well, happy Shoes day to you, sir.  Oh, my God.  And we wonder why we don't get any respect by doing radio.  Well, it is Purse day. 
[01:42:00]  It kind of sounds like Thursday.  Shut up, Jimmy.  And then we got the stupid morning team still in the bed down there in Jersey.  We're looking at their webcam still.  How long are they going to be down there?  They were supposed to raise $50,000.  This promotion started, what, three, four days ago?  Yeah.  Come on.  How great would it be if they started getting bed sores?  Got to roll them over.  Yeah.  We've all had an older relative with some sort of cancer or something.  Incontinent.  Oh, my God.  Look at the glamour photo of Linda Lambert. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  Holy crap.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my.  She cut her hair with a flobie?  Look at the front of this thing.  Wow.  George Lindsay.  That is some man.  George Lindsay, co-host of the Lambert and Lindsay Morning Show, is born and bred Kentucky guy.  No, I said bred, not inbred.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  That's not one of my dumb jokes.  It's in his bio.  He's incorrigible.  Born in Louisville, raised in Dog Creek, Kentucky.  George is one of ten kids in the Lindsay family.  When asked what they think of their brother's broadcasting career, two of his sisters replied,  I don't see why he up and left for the big city.  We got radio in these parts.  I get it.  Ah, see.  They're born in a Dog Creek, Kentucky.  That's pretty funny.  Dog Creek, Kentucky, ten kids.  What a stereotype this guy is.  I'm fixing to whoop him next time he comes home, as Brother Jordan said. 
[01:43:30]  And with that huge head of his, it's hard not to land a punch.  We were really mad when he left for New York City to produce the open Anthony show.  Speaking of heads, George is often referred to as the big giant head by his co-workers.  This is a clear reference to the mammoth cranium that rests upon his pencil-thin neck.  Can I interject with a question?  Why would anyone need to explain why they're called the big giant head? 
[01:44:00]  There can be only one explanation.  A clear reference to the mammoth cranium.  Jesus Christ.  They call him the huge cock.  Well, that seems to be a reference to his gargantuan penis.  They call him the huge head because he has Down syndrome.  The smartest member of the crew.  All right, well, we got some quotes from George Lindsay himself.  The radio bug caught me early, says Lindsay, 
[01:44:30]  who has never asked why he starred in radio in Grayson County where he was 14,  but he feels like he should tell us anyway.  I was writing sports for the local paper at 14, and I got the chance to go on the radio.  And I have been with it ever since.  What a guy.  A graduate of Western Kentucky University, George has also worked in radio across the country,  from Seattle, Washington, to Bowling Green, Kentucky.  Louisville is home now, he said, to no one in particular one afternoon.  It would be next to impossible for me to leave.  No, really. 
[01:45:00]  You can go.  That's the next line.  I think one of the reasons for the success I've had, he continued,  and am having at 102.3 the max,  is that people know I'm not some guy who is just passing through.  Ah, he's going to be there.  He's a fixture.  People like stability.  He sure is successful, too.  George's hobbies include golf, rebuilding an old jukebox,  which he's been working on for about six years now,  and no one actually thinks he's still working on it,  but he still lists it as one of his hobbies.  Oh, he's too much. 
[01:45:30]  Just George.  This guy, I mean, how do you hang with this guy?  I'm laughing.  Just George again.  Big head.  You know George.  And he also coaches junior pro basketball and soccer.  Uh-oh.  Never a good sign when adults work with children.  Yes.  The old soccer coach.  He's known around the field as Uncle Double Knuckles.  All right, then we got the bio for the hole.  Her name is Linda Lambert. 
[01:46:00]  She's also a big, giant head down there.  Linda Lambert.  The yell, my poopy hurts.  Oh, my God.  Linda Lambert.  Yep.  The hole on this fine radio show down there in Louisville.  Linda Lambert began her ascent to fame in 1979  when she was awarded the Miss Congeniality title  at the Miss Oldham County Padgett.  Wow.  Jesus. 
[01:46:30]  And her star has been rising ever since.  Oldham County Pageant.  Oldham County Pageant.  Oldham.  And her star has been rising ever since.  It's got to be at least three feet off the ground by now.  Her star really is.  It's rising like the Titanic.  79 is 26 years ago.  And it's the first credit.  And she is, from there, fucking wound up in Louisville, Kentucky doing a morning show in one market.  We have better credits than we've forgotten about 10 years ago that we don't even use anymore. 
[01:47:00]  Mabel King's legs are rising faster than her star.  I had to get that in.  All right.  Here we go.  A native of Oldham County.  Sorry to interrupt, Dolph.  Robert Reed's T-cell count is rising.  There we go.  A native of Oldham County, Linda graduated from Oldham County High School,  where she was heavily involved with the marching band.  She can tell more band camp stories than that girl from American Pie. 
[01:47:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  See, this is this fake edginess.  She did nothing.  She's got some bandstand stories.  Band camp.  Her education continued at the University of Kentucky,  where she received her degree in telecommunications.  She continues to bleed blue.  Huh?  Originally bound for a television career,  Linda worked as a reporter in Lexington, Kentucky, and Bristol, Virginia, 
[01:48:00]  before landing a job back in Louisville at WHAS Radio.  But soon the West Coast beckoned,  and Linda landed in Los Angeles, California,  and began a long run, nearly 10 years, with CBS Radio,  both as a morning co-host for KCBS FM Radio  and as a national entertainment reporter for CBS Networks.  Sounds to me like her star has been doing a lateral.  Lateral?  Her star's been doing a swan dive.  It really has been flopping around. 
[01:48:30]  Now back in Louisville, Linda lives with her husband, Thurston.  No, it's not his real name.  That's a funny name she made up.  Thurston.  And their daughters, Shelby and Barbara.  Mm-hmm.  In her spare time, Linda enjoys playing piano for her church's choir.  Plus, she's a member of the Louisville Phillies Club.  Make your own joke there.  She also spends time gardening, cooking, and shopping for shoes.  But my favorite hobby is smacking George and Aaron, she says. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, that's what they do.  She's funny.  Frankenstein.  Big feet.  Shopping for shoes at the canoe store.  My favorite hobby is hanging out and singing Puttin' on the Ritz.  Fucking ogre.  Holy shit.  My favorite hobby is calling people Big Dick Daddy.  Stinks.  It really does.  Well, good luck to that team. 
[01:49:30]  They're suspended for their little kid.  Where's the other guys?  I don't know.  Both guys look like Bob Kelly.  Just two bald idiots with goatees.  Yeah, they shave their head and come with a shaved head goatee look.  Oh, Laszlo's in studio in a little while.  We have Rob Dibble calling in about baseball at 1030.  We got Patrice O'Neal stopping by because he's doing Carolines this weekend  because Tracy Morgan had to back out last minute.  Couldn't get a white guy to replace him?  So we need to help Patrice O'Neal.  If you're in Manhattan, go to Caroline's this weekend.  We have another friend we have to help. 
[01:50:00]  Who?  We have to help Bob.  Oh, you want to do this now?  Yeah, it's not long.  I've got to take a leak, though.  Okay, we'll do it after you take a tinkle.  I'll walk right in there with you.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no, I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  That's what they call me. 
[01:50:30]  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  Hey, hey, hey.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the T.F. thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pit.  Put it in the pit.  My favorite moral treat.  My favorite eating cock. 
[01:51:00]  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  After I...  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Turtle.  Shoot your big water come right into my mouth.  Oh.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  Oh, God.  After I suck you off, 
[01:51:30]  I want you to bang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard male cock.  I stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock  from Ben the other day.  Oh.  I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  That's what they call me.  Hey, hey, hey.  She's a freak.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's what they call me.  Hey, hey, hey.  She's a freak.  And Anthony Schell.  On the bell door.  Timebox is hot! 
[01:52:30]  On the bell door.  Metallica.  Hey, I was reading the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Disturbed, their latest CD.  Yeah.  I know we're not playing Disturbed right here, but it did really, really well.  Very good.  The first week of release, it beat out Bon Jovi's smiley face record.  Or evil smiley face record.  Right.  Actually, a pretty cool logo for the Bon Jovi CD, I think.  Yeah?  Everyone has done the smiley face, but they made it look like, I don't know, like evil, smiling, and it just looked a little different. 
[01:53:00]  He's on the edge.  But Disturbed's still doing it.  And the article was great.  I would love to get those guys on the show one of these days, because they just hate all these guys that are wearing their ties and stuff in rock music now.  They're going back to wearing, like, weird, like, ties and suit jackets and things.  What, like, early 80s look?  They're trying to, like, do, like, I think they're trying to do, like...  The knack?  There you go.  They're trying to do the knack, but they're updating the look a little bit. 
[01:53:30]  That's one of the trends going on in rock music.  And the dude from Disturbed absolutely hates it.  Yeah?  Good.  Hates it, hates it, hates it.  You know?  He's hardcore.  He is.  He really is.  Israeli or something, right?  I know.  I think he's from Detroit.  He might be Israeli, but someone's from Detroit.  Chicago.  Chicago?  Chicago.  Chicago, Israel.  They will be on the show when they are in New York.  Well, that's very cool, because...  Oh, nice.  I hope I'm here.  Gee whiz.  Do you like Disturbed?  Yeah, man.  They're fucking great.  My first walk-on song ever was the fucking game.  Really?  The first time I ever tried to walk-on was the Animals. 
[01:54:00]  Oh!  Yeah.  Their first album was unbelievable.  The second one, I just didn't get into just because, I don't know, I was too busy, you  know, woe is me-ing around America, so I didn't listen to a lot of music for a year,  year and a half.  And then I came back, and now their third album is out, and I really like it.  And they do Land of Confusion by Genesis, which is...  Yeah, it's great.  You've got to love these bands that come up with these covers and make it work.  You know, every band does covers, but it's the obvious ones. 
[01:54:30]  Who would think Land of Confusion would be a great song for Disturbed, but it just works.  Mm-hmm.  So, we got Jimmy Norton in the studio, and we forgot, because it's been... we got comfortable  that he's going to be leaving us tomorrow.  Oh, no.  For another two weeks.  Well, it's only a week, really, because you guys are away.  That's right.  So I'm only missing a week, which I'm actually glad that there's a vacation.  Yeah.  And then I'm back for the Halloween that whole week.  And you're going to be at the Halloween party, right?  Of course.  Halloween party. 
[01:55:00]  See, here's the problem.  We're going to be on the radio next week, and then the week leading up to the Halloween  party, which is our big one-year anniversary party, we didn't do much on the actual day.  No.  They tried to do stuff, Jimmy.  You weren't here.  It was an embarrassment.  And we just wanted to make, like, one thing for the year.  And it was too close to the Halloween party to do two, and we're lazy.  And they were trying.  All of a sudden, Dee Schneider calls us to wish us a one-year anniversary on XM.  He doesn't give a fuck.  And he's not even part of the show, really.  So it's like, well, thanks, Dee. 
[01:55:30]  Obviously, someone told him to call, which is so embarrassing.  Because, you know, he has no...  People pound you over the Schneider thing.  Dee Schneider?  Schneider.  Schneider.  Dee Schneider.  Dee Schneider.  All right, another word I'll work on.  Let me write that down.  I almost got the boot and the put thing.  I don't think people want you to repair that, though.  No, it's cute.  I don't like the boot.  No, I hate that one.  That one I can't handle.  The other ones?  People enjoy the boot.  When I listen to the replay and I listen to some of the things I mispronounce, I'm okay  with.  But when I hear myself go, boot. 
[01:56:00]  Boot.  Boot.  It really is like drippy water.  It's awful.  Boot.  Boot.  Boot.  Schneider.  See, I can't say it that way.  And here's a segue with also the same thing.  You're saying Schneider, our friend Bob.  He has a verbal tick, which makes me want to strangle his fat neck.  He always says, shmarmy.  Don't be so shmarmy.  Right.  Smarmy.  Of course it's smarmy.  And everybody who has more than a third grade education knows that.  Smarmy.  You're not a working class guy, Bob.  Stop trying to be the regular guy.  You're a fool.  Who's... 
[01:56:30]  Can I talk about this?  What?  I got to call him, but he wants to come on.  Wait, who's...  That Dale Schaefer guy wants to come on the air.  He thinks this is a news program with Greg and Tony, but he wants to come on to discuss  the press release.  So we have a number to give him a call.  He's in his office waiting.  Which one is Dale again?  He's the vice president of...  Vice president of...  Muckety Muck.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He's the head guy.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's get Dale on.  We'll go backwards a little bit.  So you're going to be at the Halloween party.  Yes.  And the point I'm making is, so we're going to be on vacation a week leading up to the 
[01:57:00]  Halloween party, but I'm telling you, it's going to be the party to go to.  It's our first anniversary party.  It's 2U.  I'm finally putting it straight.  Brother Joe's YouTube tribute band that is going to just rock the house, the Hard Rock  Cafe.  We've got a Rush tribute band.  We have an ACDC tribute band.  It's going to be great.  How is it?  A costume contest.  I think it's going to start at 8, 8 to like midnight.  Costume contest with cash prizes.  We're looking for you guys to come up with costumes that have something to do with the 
[01:57:30]  radio show.  Everyone going will get an official first anniversary Halloween slash Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  And if you can't make the party, because this is a national show, obviously, the t-shirts  we're giving out are on opieandanthony.com, but you're going to have to purchase them.  But if you go to the show, you'll get them for free, okay?  Starts at 7.  Doors open at 7, right, Steve?  Yeah.  Doors will open at 7.  There's going to be a long line, I'm telling you.  Oh, yeah.  There's going to be a long line for this one.  And Jimmy's going to be there.  That's great.  Yeah, the whole week.  Back for the... 
[01:58:00]  Every other trip now is like a two-week jump.  I have one more three-week jump.  Everything else is just a two-week jump, so...  Right.  Happy.  We have our stand-in for our next week.  Yeah, Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  The incomparable Bill Burr.  Bill Burr is going to be back next week for a couple days.  Next week is a mess.  It's Bill Burr.  It's Patrice.  It's Rich Voss.  We're going to be all over the place next week.  It's what you want to call a medley.  It's a medley.  Speaking of which, we've got two more campaign ads. 
[01:58:30]  Ooh.  It's going to be hard going back and forth like this because...  Okay.  Hello, sir.  Hello.  Who do we have on the phone?  This is Dale Schaefer.  Dale Schaefer.  You're the VP over there?  Yeah, I'm the Vice President and General Manager.  Right.  Now, tell me a little bit about what happened.  Well, we have a morning show team made up of three people here.  It's the Lambert and Lindsay show, and then they have a sidekick named Aaron Miller. 
[01:59:00]  And yesterday morning, they decided to do a little prank just to have some fun with the listeners.  But the whole storyline, the premise is that Aaron Miller was helping a nephew with a science project where they were putting a cell phone that had GPS programming on it.  And they were going to put this cell phone up in the air with helium balloons and then track it via the Internet. 
[01:59:30]  And the GPS.  Right, right, right.  So, anyhow, just as they let go of the basket that had the...  Excuse me, sir.  Did you approve this?  No, I was not aware of it at all.  Ah, yeah, because a lot of people are wondering if management approved this.  No, not at all.  Well, that's what made the thing kind of crazy overall.  Yeah, crazy.  Wouldn't that be your job to approve these stunts before your morning show goes out and does this?  Normally, that is the case when anytime we're going to do anything that, you know, is a little bit edgy or whatever. 
[02:00:00]  They usually run it past me.  What's really odd about this is this morning show team that we're talking about, you know, they're on a hot AC station that typically, you know, they don't do anything what I'd call edgy.  They do some things that are a little crazy.  They're not what you would call shock jocks.  They're not shock jocks.  Oh, okay.  At all.  I have a question for you, sir.  I've never heard the show, but a friend of mine is from that part of the country and is actually familiar with the show.  Now, do you feel that radio like this, I mean, with the way the climate has been changing and it's been getting so dangerous for kids and people are trying to enjoy the radio and they're being assaulted with filth and really tasteless material, 
[02:00:30]  do you feel that the whole platform has to be structured a certain way or is that just going to be kind of like, you know, from there?  Yeah.  You know, I'm a strong believer in that we're in the entertainment business and so we have to be able to do things that, you know, are off the beaten path at times.  Right.  But I think that in this situation, because it went a little further than even they expected to go. 
[02:01:00]  What were some of the repercussions that happened?  Well, we received literally hundreds.  We lost track.  I mean, we had over 300 e-mails in about an hour and a half.  Right.  And then, you know, I don't know the exact number, but a lot of phone calls probably in the neighborhood of 100 to 150 phone calls over a similar period of time.  Really?  Well, all of them were pretty angry.  Some people who, number one, realized it was all a prank, you know, and eventually we went on the air and said, hey, it was all a joke. 
[02:01:30]  Hey, there is not a kitten floating over Louisville, Kentucky that's in harm's way here.  And so there were a lot of people who were just upset that we kind of, you know, attempted to fool them.  And then there were some people who felt like, who never really got it, that it was a joke.  And we're still calling this late last evening saying, you know, where's the kitten?  Did we ever save the kitten?  Right, right.  Still people still think there's a kitten up there.  We had some callers, very angry people, that just don't think it's funny to poke fun at the type of thing with cruelty to animals. 
[02:02:00]  Yes, yes.  And I guess that's why they were suspended.  And I'm still very surprised that you had no idea about this bit before they did it, sir.  You know, honestly.  Are you taking any responsibility as far as being the boss of this morning show?  Well, I'm absolutely, you know, my responsibility is to make sure that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing.  But I did not know anything about this particular.  And where did the bit come from?  Honestly, I don't know. 
[02:02:30]  Well, they, you know, had tried to mastermind an idea, I guess, to have some fun.  I mean, these guys.  Do you think it's an original idea that they just came up with?  I'm not sure how original.  It's probably been used somewhere, somewhere, someplace else at some other time.  I don't know.  But, I mean, quite honestly, I haven't done any research on whether it's an original idea or not.  You know, when I asked them, how did you guys come up with this?  They just said that they, you know, thought it would be funny.  They, you know, that they were just looking for some way to have a little bit of fun with the little ones. 
[02:03:00]  Are you outraged, sir?  I'm not outraged.  Are the sponsors outraged?  You know, we've had very little repercussion from advertisers themselves.  Oh, that's good.  But what we have had is a pretty strong outrage from a lot of our listeners.  Yeah.  And then, you know, after I suspended them and we went on the air and let people know that we had taken action,  then the phone calls went the other way. 
[02:03:30]  I got bombarded with people going, hey, how can you suspend these?  They were just having fun, blah, blah, blah.  So that's what I'm quite honestly dealing with this morning is I'm just, because they are off the air this morning.  You're getting a lot of phone calls about this.  I'm getting a lot of phone calls.  A lot of media inquiries.  We have had quite a bit of media inquiries.  Inquiries.  Or inquiries.  Actually, it kind of blows my mind, but a lot of our listeners were calling TV stations and telling them, you know, 
[02:04:00]  the news department's telling them that there's this kitten floating around.  Right.  Yesterday we started all these calls.  Let me tell you.  Let's open up our phone line, actually.  Steve from Yellowstone is here and wants to ask you a couple of questions, sir.  Sure.  Steve, you're on with Dale Schaefer.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, Mr. Schaefer.  Yes.  Yeah, I just, I understand.  Like, I know that there's been a lot of things kind of happening, and I was driving, and I just don't think that it's appropriate to make fun of that kind of stuff. 
[02:04:30]  But I don't want to seem like a stick in the mud, but why would they make fun of the animals being injured like that?  When I was in my hybrid, I heard that the stunt got very out of hand.  Well, first off, in the whole bit, the whole joke.  Kitten rape is funny. 
[02:05:00]  Ramone, Lindsay looks like a tranny, or Lambert, whichever one of them is the whole.  Ramone, bring me a chick with a dick.  Ramone, bring me an exclamation point. 
[02:05:30]  Ramone, Lindsay and Lambert have AIDS.  Dale?  Yes.  Comment?  I don't think there's any comment that could be made for that.  Yeah, that's obviously a prank call.  I'm sorry about that, sir.  That's all right.  Thank you, Steve.  Steve from Yellowstone. 
[02:06:00]  We have the official announcement that you have on your website.  Yes.  And we're very disturbed because as part of the announcement, you've got an actual little kitten in a basket.  It seems like it makes light of the whole thing.  It makes light of the whole hoax.  Well, that was the picture that they were using as a part of the whole joke when it was all going on,  that they were saying we've got a picture of the kitten on the website. 
[02:06:30]  Uh-huh.  And so we chose to leave that up there and explain with the comment that I made that that was all, that indeed it was a joke.  Yeah.  That sounds, I don't know, it sounds like this bid has been done in many markets across America.  And it may have been.  As I said, I did not look into it.  It's just that it happened here in Louisville.  We've addressed it here, you know, appropriately as we feel like to try to put this thing to bed. 
[02:07:00]  Who's filling in now for George, Linda, and Aaron?  Well, this morning we're just playing music and, you know, doing our normal features and everything.  And it's all being done by the door.  What are some of the normal features?  You do a shoes day or something like that?  Yeah, there's a large number of entertainment-type features and things like that.  I don't think there's any need to get into all this.  Yeah, okay.  No, we're just trying to figure out what kind of show.  Yeah, what kind of station or show.  Trying to figure out if it is a shock jock type of show. 
[02:07:30]  When are the hosts?  It's not a shock jock show.  It's what I would call a family-friendly full-service morning show.  Oh, that's good.  All right, and when will the morning team be returning?  Well, at this point, we've got a meeting set with them a little bit later this morning  and to talk with them, and we'll go from there.  All right, I'm assuming maybe a week?  Probably.  Probably a week?  Yes.  All right, let's say hi to Danny, and what's W-Town?  Hello? 
[02:08:00]  Danny?  Yeah, why is everybody getting so bent out of shape?  It's a joke.  Like, I mean, are they really going to fire these guys over just like, what's a joke?  Like, everybody gets in trouble for just a joke.  Yeah, it doesn't seem a little extreme.  They're not going to be fired for this, no.  Uh, but because...  Ramone!  Lindsey puts milk on his cock and lets kittens lick it off.  Ramone!  Bring me a station manager who isn't a faggot.  Ramone! 
[02:08:30]  Kentucky is full of incest survivors.  Ramone!  Your morning show sucks dicks!  Ramone!  This man should die in a car accident! 
[02:09:00]  Good gosh.  Can we get a screener that actually does his job?  Jesus.  All right.  Thank you.  Ramone!  Ramone!  That'll show for patient me off!  Could you, uh, please hang up on this, uh, gentleman?  Ramone!  I'm running out of shit to say! 
[02:09:30]  Ramone!  Holy shit!  Oh, God!  Oh!  There's your hoax, buddy!  Never laughed so hard at a Ramone bit.  There's your hoax right up your jumper, Dale! 
[02:10:00]  God damn, Jimmy!  I'm going to give you a standing o' bro.  Milk on his cock!  And lets a kitten lick it off!  Oh, wow!  Did he hang up?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Finally.  There's your hoax, Dale!  There it is!  Right up your doomper!  By the way, you notice, uh, very funny, obviously, Jimmy, but you notice he said, yeah, they'll 
[02:10:30]  probably be off the air for a week.  Yeah, a week.  You know, the vacation time.  It's vacation time!  Vacation time!  Oh, God.  All right.  Oh!  Dale's a douche.  Dale, that's a...  What?  He wanted to believe so bad that he was actually talking to the media about this dumb radio stunt.  Oh, he was all psyched, you know.  I heard you laughing in the background.  I couldn't take it. 
[02:11:00]  Dude, we couldn't...  I couldn't even get on mic to try to, like, patch it up.  You know what's weird when you get into that situation?  Like, the guy's in Louisville, and you're, like, you're taking it to the extreme like that.  Ant and I have to get as far away from the mics as possible.  I couldn't look at the mic.  Like, that's going to help us to move away from the mics.  I was looking out the window.  I couldn't...  I had to go somewhere else.  Bring me a general manager that doesn't take it in the ass.  Poor Dale, hoping he was... 
[02:11:30]  That was his big moment.  He thought he was talking to the media.  Yep.  Old Steve from Yellowstone.  Oh.  Creep.  Goddamn, that's Steve from Yellowstone.  Damn him.  Becoming the premier bit on this program.  And then Ben laughing in the background that time was just...  You hear Ben laughing?  So loud.  There was at one point, his laugh came through so fucking loud.  Ben really...  We make fun of it, but Ben has one of the best laughs ever.  I told you, when I was shooting for HBO, I looked out, and there was one point I almost  lost my composure, because I see stupid Ben laughing and cackling, and I had to not 
[02:12:00]  address it, or I was going to laugh and lose where I was.  It really is a contagious fucking laugh.  The best line, someone is saying.  The answer to feedback going nuts here.  The best line, though, from Sam in Teaneck.  Ramon, I'm running out of shit to say.  The line of the day.  That poor son of a bitch thought he was talking to the news.  Talking to people that really cared about his little bit. 
[02:12:30]  That's right.  He was bringing me a chick with a dick.  Stupid crutch.  Bringing me a chick with a dick.  Holy shit, I'm pissing myself.  I don't know if this is gold.  Jeff in Jersey.  Yeah, the rave reviews are pouring in, Jamie.  Notice no comments from Connecticut or Westchester.  Yes.  That one.  Pissing myself.  My sides are killing me.  And Charles from Philly, he says it all.  And Dale hangs in there.  He's hanging in there, because he really wants to believe he's talking to someone important  in the media.  And he let you, like you guys would let me get eight Ramon lines in.  Oh, I know. 
[02:13:00]  Like, what are we running here?  Can someone hang up on him?  We can't even hang the phones up.  Yeah.  Oh, someone hang up on him.  Ramon.  Wow.  This is just becoming one of those goofy Friday shows, and I love it.  Absolutely.  Very good.  Very good, Jimmy.  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  It was funny when you said, where are you going, Jimmy?  That really made me laugh, Jimmy.  You were setting it up.  Of course.  You got it.  You know.  Where are you going, Jimmy?  You want the listeners at home to go, oh, no, here it comes.  That made me laugh.  Here it comes. 
[02:13:30]  Kill a kitten, sure.  See, Eric?  That's a good one.  Look how it ties in.  See, it's boring when we point out when Eric is doing a good job, but here you go.  Here you go.  Eric doing a good job.  Walk is on fire.  He says, play Kill a Kitten going into break.  It's perfect after that bit.  Absolutely.  That's my new crutch word, by the way.  Absolutely.  It's a good word.  Thank you.  Lovely.  Stephen Lynch, one of our pals.  It's a sing-along, too, so everybody feel free to join in. 
[02:14:00]  A little bouncing balls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you kill a kitten.  Mark my words, because from where I'm sitting,  You can't go wrong if you kill a kitten. 
[02:14:30]  Look at those balls.  There's no crime that you'll be committing.  I know the law.  You can kill a kitten.  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting,  You'll get plenty when you kill a kitten. 
[02:15:00]  Feed it turpentine, or break its spine.  Crush it with your shoe, as long as you kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Listen up.  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten, 
[02:15:30]  She'll like you better when you kill a kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, because that's where it's written.  If ye loveth Jesus, ye must kill a kitten.  Throw him at a train.  Make him snort cocaine.  Drown him in a lake. 
[02:16:00]  Bake a kitty cake.  Flush him down the can.  Hit him with your van.  Stick some tea and tea up his cat booty.  Do what you must do, as long as you kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  You got to kill a kitten. 
[02:16:30]  Alright.  Alright.  Killing kittens isn't easy.  And if the thought makes you feel queasy,  Grab a pitchfork from the shed.  And kill a puppy dog instead. 
[02:17:00]  Kill a kitten.  You got to kill a kitten.  A little furry kitten.  You got to kill a kitten.  You got to kill a mother.  You got to kill a kitten.  Kill a little kitten.  Kill him in a...  8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  Meow. 
[02:17:30]  Steven Lynch, everyone.  Next time, on a very special Everybody Loves Raymond.  Ray goes to the doctor.  Ray, would you like to see your test results?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Ray is doing.  Ray.  Oh.  I'm afraid you've got AIDS.  No.  Come on.  You have a rare strain of HIV.  No.  Commonly found in post-op Portuguese transsexuals.  No.  The fun really begins when Ray's wife finds out.  Why is the toilet filled with bloody poo?  Come on.  Oh, my God.  The bed is full of scabs.  It's hot. 
[02:18:00]  But everything works out in the end.  Sweetie, you're losing so much weight.  I bought you a smaller robe.  Come on.  Come on.  Ray, your mother's here.  She wants to say goodbye.  Oh, where are you going?  All on the next Everybody Loves Raymond.  Tonight at 8.  We are on our charts, yeah.  Never get it now.  We are on our charts, yeah.  Give me some of that stuff. 
[02:18:30]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Walt B.  I will acknowledge your birthday now.  Especially after that last bit.  Wow.  I thought you forgot it.  No, I did not forget your birthday, Jimmy.  No offense, Jimmy, but if you wanted to skip your birthday for a few days, I wouldn't mind.  Yeah, I'm getting a little tired of the party bit myself.  Wow.  Pretty specific.  Jimmy's birthday only comes once a year.  Well, not Jimmy Norton's birthday. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, it does.  I'm stuck in my birthday.  And finally.  We know it's not really your birthday, Jimmy.  You know?  Yes, we know.  When Mr. Giggles broke your thingamajiggity, he undid that dark and sinister hold you had over our thoughts.  From now on, you'll just have to wait for your birthday like everyone else.  That's right.  That's right, Jimmy.  What's that from?  We're teaching you.  What's that from? 
[02:19:30]  What is that from?  Anyone know?  Uh-oh, Hawk.  It's another pickup from Hawk.  It's from a cartoon called Jimmy Neutron.  Oh, wow.  Oh, little Jimmy Neutron.  Look at Eric.  Do you watch that?  Eric's been looking very good the last hour.  A lot of pickups for the show.  He might actually break even by the end of it.  No, he's doing all right.  He takes it very seriously when we yell at him.  So we've got to show when he's doing well.  Bob Kelly audio.  What's this about, Jimmy?  Well, I'm sorry, guys.  I have a mouthful of apple.  You certainly do. 
[02:20:00]  I polished it.  On your lapel?  Yeah.  Jimmy actually came prepared today.  That brings you.  Yeah.  He's great on the fly.  We all know that.  But he actually walked in with something for the show today.  Preparation.  That's why I came in a moment after you guys started, because I was in studio recording something with Martini Steve.  For an hour beforehand?  Yeah.  I got in at 6, but I was in the other room.  As we're sitting in the office from 6 to 7, stressing and trying to figure out what the hell we're going to do today.  Dude, how do you think I feel getting up at 6.18? 
[02:20:30]  Shit, am I going to make it?  So, I got a message from Bob Kelly yesterday.  And there's two tracks on there.  Yeah.  The first one you want to play would be the message that I got from my friend Bob Kelly.  What about the Bob Kelly promo?  That would be after it.  After?  Yeah, yeah.  It makes a little bit of sense.  All right.  All right.  I got you.  All right.  So, this is a message you just left on your machine?  Yes.  And I had to say it.  Bob Kelly, who's filled in for you while you're in L.A.?  Yes. 
[02:21:00]  He's done a great job for us.  He opens up for Dane Cook and kills on the road.  He does.  Yes.  All right.  Torgasm.  So, why is he depressed?  I don't know.  Bob may have an answer for that.  Oh, boy.  What's up, Norik?  Saw you on the...  Jay Leno, he fucking killed, dude.  Unbelievable.  Really great job on the couch.  Very proud, man.  Really.  Me and Don Watson were laughing.  I'm in Philly at the Helium Comedy Club. 
[02:21:30]  I had 22 people at the show tonight.  I...  I don't even know what to say, dude.  I'm just a fucking...  Anytime I think that I have any type of wow, maybe I might fucking have some fans.  Maybe I might make some fucking headway in this business.  I get slapped in the face with the reality that nobody knows me. 
[02:22:00]  Nobody fucking knows who I am.  And I'm up there for 22 people doing a fucking show.  Ugh.  I fucking...  I'm in my hotel room with a fucking McDonald's bag the size of a fucking carry-on suitcase.  I quit smoking today.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...  And that's it? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, perhaps there'd be more than 22 people, you idiot.  If you gave out where the Helium Comedy Club was, you jackass.  Well, that's why I wanted to play the promo after, because there's a reason why Stupid had 22 people in the club.  What an...  Yeah.  Oh, he's all depressed.  How about thinking out what you say on a promo?  Yeah, walk through this a little bit.  He sees Jim Norton on the, on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Leno Killing, and then he goes to this club and 22 people are there.  22 people.  And he's been killing on our show. 
[02:23:00]  He kills for Dane Cook, and he does a promo that ran on our show for well over a week.  Well over a week.  Did you hear the promo?  Here's the promo.  Bob Kelly sucks being made live.  You're listening to Robert Kelly on Opie and Anthony.  I'm going to be at the Helium, Helium.  Helium Comedy Club, the 12th to the 15th of this month, October.  It's Helium.  I don't know.  It's just open.  Go to HeliumComedyClubSomething.com.  I think for more information, go to RobertKelleyLive.com. 
[02:23:30]  No one makes this worse.  The club just opened, so you not only have to tell what city it's in, what street it's on.  The number.  The number.  This fucking dummy gives out nothing but the name of the Helium Comedy Club, and he wonders  why no one shows up.  You don't.  You really are stupid.  And I let the message back.  I'm like, you know what?  You should be depressed because you're a flop.  It's a flop.  We got a lot of instant feedback, too, asking, you know, I want to see Bob Kelly. 
[02:24:00]  Where is this Helium Club?  Is it in Kentucky where I'm at now?  Yeah.  They had no idea.  Check your world atlas for where the fucking place is.  It's like, you know, even if you forget to give out the number, how do you not give out  this?  I did finally talk to him.  A city.  And this is the beauty of Bob.  He's like, dude, there were people there who came.  They saw me on tourgasm in front of 8,500 people.  And he goes, and I felt bad for it, but they had to sit in front of, like, with, you know,  15 other people. 
[02:24:30]  I'm like, no, stupid.  You felt bad for you.  For you.  Because that was the confirmation, you're right, tourgasm was all Dane Cook, and this  is what happens when it's all the, wow, 8,500, 22.  Oh, wow.  That's, that's 11, twice.  And then you got to sit there and look at Jimmy Norton on Jay Leno and watch, you know,  a guy that you're in this business with, you're friends with him, and there he is on the goddamn 
[02:25:00]  tonight's show, 22.  And they've been friends a long time, so, you know, Bob Kelly has watched Jim Norton's  rise to the point where he's on Jay Leno.  Oh, they were on equal footing for quite some time, I bet.  And then Bob is assuming, well, it's going to happen to me now.  I'm getting more airtime on Opie and Anthony.  I'm opening up for Dane Cook.  It's happening for me now.  And I bet you, as he went to Philly, he had a little strut in his...  A little strut in his walk.  A little strut in his walk.  He's like, I'm feeling pretty good about this.  It's starting to happen for me now.  Bob Kelly, could you straighten up that seat back and fasten the seatbelt? 
[02:25:30]  The ship is coming back down to earth.  And then he shows up and there's 22, but it's partly his fault because no one even knew  the club was in Philly.  It's all his fault.  Because he said at the Stress Factory, I had people, I'm like, first of all, stupid,  the Stress Factory is an established club that people, hey, let's go back to the Stress Factory.  We had a great time with, you know, Norton.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like, this is a brand new club.  No one knows where it is. 
[02:26:00]  And you dumb motherfucker, you didn't mention that it was in Philadelphia.  You didn't give the number.  And it was a storm night.  I'm like, hey, shithead, there's 60 mile an hour winds.  No one's leaving the house.  And there's the playoffs.  And you don't mention the city.  And you don't mention the number.  And you wind up and no one shows up to see you.  And then he leaves the depressing message.  I howled when I heard that message.  The audience is very sympathetic.  Ed from Jersey.  There it is.  Bob Kelly's funniest appearance on the show.  Mr. Bildo from Detroit.  I broke my promo, man. 
[02:26:30]  Where is Helium?  Somewhere in Philly.  I don't know.  It's a new comedy club.  So if you're in Philadelphia, Bob is a very funny standout.  Go check him out at the Helium.  Look it up.  Or look information.  I don't have the number.  Oh, he's still there.  All weekend.  This was from yesterday.  All right.  So let's see what the power of the show could do.  Do some work for the guy.  You know, we just made fun of him.  But let me tell you, I saw him recently open up for Dane Coates.  And he destroyed.  Some people that I was with thought he was funnier than Dane.  And I'm not just saying that. 
[02:27:00]  I mean, he destroyed.  So if you want to check him out, he's at the Helium Club.  Here it is.  Philadelphia.  It's 2031 Sansom Street.  Right?  S-A-N-S-O-M Street.  The phone number, 215-496-9001.  215-496-9001 to see Bob Kelly at the Helium Comedy Club in Philly.  Help him out.  He really, really is funny.  But it was just fucking, I was like you.  Because I heard that yesterday.  I was kind of trashing him. 
[02:27:30]  I'm like, what a dummy.  Who leaves a promo that they don't leave the city?  And when you're at the Helium Comedy Club and you're sitting in the back, just yell out to Bob,  we're here for you, man.  We're here for you, man.  I think you should holler that at that dummy.  Is Bill Burr in Philly also this weekend?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, Bill Burr.  Bill Burr was playing the electric factory here in Philly last night also.  He managed to tell people what city he was in.  Yeah.  I bet there were more than 22 people there.  Well, he's on a big tour with Montreal Just For Laughs, which is Bill, it's Harry Spears, it's Nick DiPaolo. 
[02:28:00]  There's like 15 or 12 guys, a huge Geraldo.  There's a lot of people on it.  Wow.  Of course, you know, yours truly was never asked because the festivals never embrace me and they never will.  Of course.  Good.  Yeah.  You know something?  You stick with Leno, my friend.  And you guys.  Going on.  No one puts asses in the seat like fucking Greg and Tony.  We know that.  No one.  That's a limited time thing.  No, it's not.  All right.  My boys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Brad in Cleveland. 
[02:28:30]  Brad.  Brad, thanks for calling the program.  Hey, Brad.  Thanks, little Jimmy.  All right.  Hey, you know, I got two things for you real quick.  All right.  The first thing is, how come on the back of your promos as far as, like, the, you know,  I approve this message isn't on the back of it?  Oh, that would be good.  On the Bill Burr, Jimmy Norton election promos that we've been running, it should say, I'm Jimmy  Norton and I endorse this.  Oh, can you do that before you leave for L.A.?  Because they're going to run with this thing for a while.  I approve them.  Well, we've got two more campaign ads. 
[02:29:00]  I'll make my informed political decision.  Hopefully you heard these yesterday.  If you didn't, when Bill Burr is sitting in the head seat next week, we're going to play  him for Bill, too, because we love controversy on this show.  Hey, Jimmy, I'm in a swing state.  And I'll tell you, if you come prepared more often, I'm voting for Jimmy Norton.  Oh.  Oh.  Jimmy's been a superstar today.  Yes, sir.  I'm always prepared.  He's the MVP of the program.  I show up with my fat tits and my awful life.  All right, we've got a couple more campaign ads.  Quick, Alan from Philly. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  From a blurb from the Helium Comedy Club.  It's a state-of-the-art venue that brings great talent to an intimate 240-seat theater.  And he had 15 people.  No, he had 22 people.  22.  Bob, you don't want to fuck with his bonus money.  Bob had, I think the bonus was, if you bring in over 19, you're a bonus.  So Bob hit it by three.  I like how they called 240 people intimate.  And he had a tenth of that. 
[02:30:00]  Almost a tenth of that.  Bob had 8% of that place full.  Dude, I felt 8%.  Bob could have done his act in his car for these people.  He absolutely could have.  I can just picture him, too.  Again, just alone eating McDonald's in his hotel room.  Fucking thinking of what could have been.  All right.  Yeah, just dipping his fries.  Looking at you on Leno.  Eating.  Dipping those fries alone.  All right, well, we have two more campaign ads.  Yeah.  Two new cameras. 
[02:30:30]  They're fucking doing our...  That is unbelievable.  That's the bit they're talking about that they're doing.  The Ambien CR commercial.  Oh, crap.  Looks a lot like our salt on the media thing.  It sure does.  Without the humor or interesting...  Can I guarantee you the news stories are hokey and cute?  Of course.  I guess it shows that we're doing something.  You guarantee that it's not like a great news story?  Like, yeah, we're here where there's been a crib death.  And all of a sudden, the guy runs in the back with the Ambien.  Ambien, yeah.  So they're pulling out, like, just a little blanket full of disappointment. 
[02:31:00]  That's the Lord's little practical joke.  Ha-ha.  Painted the room, did you?  He was fine yesterday.  All right.  Face down in the blankie.  I picked him up and he was...  All right, Jimmy.  Oh, I'm trying to talk to you.  Like a fucking...  Like a little cold hen.  Like a fucking Cornish game hen you pull out of the fridge. 
[02:31:30]  Picture a Cornish game hen with a doll's head on it.  You had college hopes for that.  What is wrong with you?  Nothing.  I'm just chit-chatting about a commercial.  You're leaving a big wreck that we're going to have to clean up on Monday.  You get to go off to L.A. and be a star.  And we have to, like...  We have to work around this on Monday.  Better get a breast pump.  Can't just leave it sitting in there. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  You know...  Oh, that milk's going to go to waste.  All right.  All right.  I hope he can come quick and they hold out for nine months.  That's right.  Every time there's a little spot in front of that shirt, you're going to be...  That's what could have been.  Every time a little leaky wet spot in front of that shirt. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, God.  Next time, stick some wheel chocks under his hips.  Uh-oh.  All right.  All right.  I'm sure that story wasn't there behind the ambient...  In front of the ambient guy.  Probably not.  In conclusion.  Yeah.  Pick that little fella by the elbow.  Like a little suit chase. 
[02:33:00]  You get to leave after this.  Yeah.  He can flee the show.  You can flee the show for two weeks.  Oh.  We're trying to make things happen here.  Wow.  You wonder how many years it is before they stop saying,  he would have been blank today.  All right.  All right.  We got Bill Burr and Jimmy Norton campaign ads. 
[02:33:30]  Pat from Munaki.  A bag full of better luck next time.  Damn, Pat.  Too funny to be you.  Oh, that's funny.  Horrible.  Oh, you don't...  No, no, no.  Leave the stretcher in.  We'll carry this one out. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  In summation...  Yeah.  That's not the story you would see on that ambient commercial.  So, where were we?  Uh, phones?  What?  Can you guys ask Logan why you guys are not included in the AOL Radio XM channels?  Uh, this bit?  Exactly.  I think he's being a little...  That's exactly why I, uh, read that one at this particular time. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, he was...  Okay, yeah.  We are trying to build the audience.  Someday we'd like to really be talking to a huge audience.  We'd like to build the audience.  It's not our fault there's one less somewhere.  Exactly.  Maybe if Monty's DNA wasn't so tainted, there'd be a bigger audience.  And then we're not going to be on in Canada.  Do we find that type of humor they have a problem with?  And then we'll be the ones yelling and screaming, why not, why not, why not?  Hey, Canada is, uh, repressive.  It's a very big market. 
[02:35:00]  It certainly is.  I'd love to do it.  It's a massive market.  They're repressive.  So we're not going to be on XM Canada or...  Are you sure?  Or AOL Radio.  Oh, AOL will have us.  Supposedly we're not on it.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  All right, we got ad campaigns for Bill Burr versus Jimmy Noren, a little thing that's  been, uh...  Here we go.  ...been talked about behind the scenes, and then...  Yep.  ...and then Steve and Danny have been running with this, and the rest of the boys, and  they're coming up with, uh, campaign ads.  I just want to know. 
[02:35:30]  Dude, you're going to be...  Oh, God.  Do you...  You know how they have, like, the little walkie-talkies?  Do you think after a few hours, Mom picks up the one in her room and goes, I don't think  this thing is working.  All you hear from the other room...  Or just the sound of the humidifier...  ...the clanging of the little mobile? 
[02:36:00]  ...  Plink, plink, plink, plink, plink, plink.  This is the kind of material that never happens when Billy's here. 
[02:36:30]  It just doesn't happen.  That's, uh...  Some people would say that.  Some people.  Ah!  And then we'll bitch why we're not on in Canada or AOL.  Campaign, man.  We're right.  Right.  Campaign ads.  Well, you know, the elections are happening.  You can't have it both ways, is the point I would make.  You can't bitch about not being on in Canada or AOL.  But that's not true, because you should be on Canada or AOL.  Right.  That's not a... 
[02:37:00]  It's a pay service.  All right.  Bill Burr and Jimmy Norton.  Yes, this campaign ad thing has been taken on a life of its own.  And people, at this point, it's more of a joke than anything.  And, you know, we're doing these mock-up political ads.  Yes.  In your town, you might have seen some of the guys going at it on TV.  Usually it's mudslinging.  Right.  And, well, that's the spirit of these ads.  Bill and Jimmy.  We had four of them yesterday.  We got a couple new ones today.  One on TV right now.  And next week we'll play them again if you missed them yesterday, okay? 
[02:37:30]  But here's the new ones.  We got two new ones.  Long-term care for senior citizens is a critical issue.  Jim Norton's response was to sodomize an elderly man with a slide whistle.  Oh, we love you, pop-pop.  Bill Burr uses a well-lubricated penny whistle.  Caring.  Sensitive.  Redhead.  Bill Burr for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Bill Burr. 
[02:38:00]  Now there's penetration going on with old people?  Of course there is.  Because it's always got to go over the top.  Over the wall.  And here's one more.  Bill Burr exposed himself to a group of seniors during a magic show.  Jim Norton thinks magic shows are gay.  Jim Norton for Third Mike.  Paid for by the fans of Jim Norton.  All right.  Anti-climatic?  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  I mean, I'm sure you're a little lackluster this time.  Good word.  Like not as much time was spent on him as the others.  Yeah.  Then again, they were following some odd little segment there.  Yeah, let's get Lazlo in.  Lazlo.  Lazlo.  There he is.  What's up, Lazlo?  How's it going?  Very good.  It's good to see you back.  It was brutal.  Thanks, buddy. 
[02:39:00]  Isn't it good to see you, Jimmy?  At least the people on Instant Feedback still like us.  Yeah.  Lazlo.  So you're going to this digital life thing today?  Yes.  Very excited.  I wouldn't be.  About going home afterwards, but I have to go, yes, beforehand.  Then we're going to be at the Javits Center at what, 1230 today?  1230 to 130.  Mm-hmm.  So.  These tech conventions used to be huge in New York, and then when the dot-com bubble went  kaplooey.  Yeah, people. 
[02:39:30]  Literally, it got so bad, they had this little section of the Javits Center in like 20 booths.  Company's still in business.  But it's getting bigger now.  Yeah, because I like electronics.  I like technology.  Love this stuff.  But I go to these things, and I find myself a little put off by the whole corporate thing  that it is.  I don't know.  It's not.  They're not fun.  It's a big bunch of PR.  I want to go and have some fun.  Is it fun these days?  Have they brought the fun back?  No.  There's usually like three or four impersonators that are always there. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  There's always like an Austin Powers guy, and there's usually booth bitches.  I mean, that's the only thing to look forward to.  Booth bitches, they're like the hot chicks that kind of stand around the merchandise.  And hand out demos and stuff.  Right, keychains.  But it's nothing like the Consumer Electronics Show.  I mean, you guys were in the hall last year.  The best booth bitches.  That was awesome, actually.  So what can I look forward to?  Is there anything happening over there?  Is there a buzz on anything?  No. 
[02:40:30]  Anything new coming out?  Last night they had this media event where they show some of the stuff so that you don't  have to deal with all that hubbub on the floor with the common people.  I don't want hubbub.  And they had this one website called Homepages.  And it sounds really boring, like it's a real estate website, but you can look at an aerial  view of a city, and it's like shaded in different parts.  So I'm asking the guy, you know, is that ethnicity?  What do you got going there?  Because it'll show you little icons of houses if you're looking to buy a house, say, on Long 
[02:41:00]  Island.  Sure.  And he's like, no, it's not ethnicity.  That's school districts.  You know, how the school districts perform.  And there's other data that you can put in to shade the areas like crime rates, things  like that.  Yeah.  No, it's not done by race.  So I was talking to the guy.  He's like, you know, it's good to see racial profiling has finally come to the desktop.  But it's not called racial profiling.  It's school district performance.  So the higher the test scores, the, let's say, lighter the color code would be on the 
[02:41:30]  map.  Right.  And then the worse the test scores, the...  The worse the test scores, like the lower on the chart it gets, like as far as...  Does anybody know what I'm saying when I'm saying it?  I got my finger ready.  Go ahead and hit it.  I won't explain that one.  I'll take the crash.  There's a lot of...  The evolutionary chart.  There's a lot of gaming stuff over there, like the...  Yeah?  Yeah, the big thing, like the gaming mouses now, they've got the tuning where you...  It comes with a set of weights, and you can put weights in the bottom on different 
[02:42:00]  sides of the mouse to sort of...  Yeah, that seems like something I don't even need.  Well, you do most of your gaming on your laptop, don't you?  No, no.  My game...  I can't frigging get a laptop that really works.  No matter what they say, it's never as good as a desktop.  I like the huge screen.  I like playing in widescreen now.  And, yeah, mouse and keyboard.  I don't need some special...  Because they put out like a gaming mouse for first-person shooters, and it doesn't work  as well as just the mouse and the keyboard.  They try to improve on the simplicity of the mouse keyboard. 
[02:42:30]  Well, now they've got the 2,000 DPI mouse for gaming that you can adjust how sensitive  it is on the slide.  How sensitive it is, and yeah, how much it'll move, depending on how far you move the mouse,  how far your targeting reticle...  Recticle?  Rectum?  Rectum will move.  But is it real?  Have you ever gone, I missed that shot because I was off a pixel?  No.  No.  This is for those people that, like, game professionally.  I love going to the conventions and meeting these people that make literally over $100,000 
[02:43:00]  a year, waking up at noon, eating Doritos and playing video games.  Well, they're very excited to introduce us today to the gaming chicks.  There are some chicks that come from somewhere.  Last time we met the Swedish, like, video gaming team.  Oh, that was with Sink Magazine.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And at this convention, Opie, there's some other collection of broads that play games.  I don't know where they're from, what they do, who really cares.  But they play games.  And you know what?  They don't really play, do they? 
[02:43:30]  The hotter they are, the less they really play.  They're just there as, yeah, the babes that stand around the equipment.  And you were talking about the screen size.  Like, last time I was hanging out with you, with Bill and everything.  We were talking about the PSP, and you said you weren't down with the tiny screen.  And then, right after that, comes the video iPod that's got, like, the tiniest screen ever.  Yeah, smaller.  And you're supposed to be watching TV shows.  Yeah, but the detail on those things.  Yeah.  I was looking at the Samsung products.  We just talked about this, I guess, yesterday. 
[02:44:00]  And the detail is amazing.  You can still figure out what's going on there.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, the PSP screen's amazing.  They've done a really good job on that.  What do you think of the iPod thing with the TV?  What is that?  Can you watch live TV, or you can only download TV programs into the iPod, right?  You download TV programs.  I mean, the day after they broadcast, you can download them.  And ABCs.  There's definitely a market for that, by the way.  Sure.  Dude, who watches live TV?  I mean, I was talking to Anthony about this.  I love to rack about six weeks' worth of a show into my DVR. 
[02:44:30]  It's all about the marathon.  So if you get into the cliffhanger, it's like, you know what?  Fuck you.  I don't have to wait a week.  Real world live TV started that, and it's a great way to watch TV, the marathon.  The marathon.  Now, when I watch the Bonaduce show, whatever, just a one-half-hour episode, who cares?  But when you can string them all together, yeah, you get a couple hours of good viewing there.  Yeah, and Apple did that deal with ABC, and ABC affiliates are pissed, because a lot of  people don't know that there's ABC corporate, and then there's the individual stations in  different markets, and those are owned by different people, in most cases. 
[02:45:00]  Right.  And they're all upset, because they're like, well, what about advertisers?  Right.  Well, sorry.  But this is an industry that, you know, when DVRs hit the scene, said that people that  have TiVos and digital video recorders are stealing.  Dude, I pay like $80 to $100 a month for my cable bill.  I'm stealing?  Yeah, I'm well over $100.  That's stealing, you son of a bitch.  You're absolutely right.  Good point.  And plus, here's the thing that I always find hysterical.  You're paying almost like $100 a month for channels that have commercials.  So, I'm paying to watch your commercial. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  You know?  I never understood the way they call it stealing, but...  Isn't there something that they want to make the time that you can store a program  limited on DVRs and TiVos?  So, if you tape a program, tape, you record a program, it'll only be recorded in your machine  for a certain amount of time, and then you lose it.  Why?  So, you can't just load up on shows, not watch any commercial television, and fast-forward  through all the commercials.  You'll be forced at some point to either re-record it or watch it on TV. 
[02:46:00]  These pieces of shit have been doing product placement in films for 30 years.  Or in Sopranos, where they're standing in front of the Home Depot through a huge soliloquy.  It's like, you want to go in the Home Depot with some fine lumber?  No.  Let's go whack somebody.  And the record executives now are pissed off at Apple, because record executives are now...  I was reading that in Rolling Stone, the copy protection?  Well, not just that.  The record companies are saying that they should get a piece of iPod sales. 
[02:46:30]  Just iPod sales?  Yeah.  Well, because they're the biggest one.  They're saying, well, you know, you guys are making a ton of money off of this, but it's  like, hey guys, if you remember, you were suing to keep MP3 players off the market, and  now you want a piece of the pie.  They want a piece of the iPod sales or a piece of the...  Well, they're already getting a piece of the downloads.  And they want to start variable pricing on those.  Isn't that like asking for a piece of the, you know, in the olden days, a piece of your  record player sales?  Yeah.  And it's like... 
[02:47:00]  They would want...  It's like Wonder Bread saying that they should get a piece of toaster sales.  Yeah.  It's really...  Right.  They really are getting fucking ridiculous.  That's some greedy shit, man.  Because of this new technology, I think people are being turned on to a lot more music than  they were.  Well, and the record companies have been cut out of the distribution chain.  Really?  I mean, who needs to print a CD and get it shipped to a record store?  Nobody.  Yeah, you don't need a hard copy of anything anymore.  I was in Blockbuster the other day just looking around going, man, this is going to be... 
[02:47:30]  That place is obsolete.  I was going to say, this is going to be so gone in another year or two.  Because, you know, I have so many choices for movies on my cable already, and the latest  releases for the most part, and the pay-per-view and all that.  And I'm like, why are people still going to Blockbuster?  In another year or two, you've got to think that all the movies are just going to be available  on the cable.  And on demand.  Right.  Because it's heading that way.  Each station has, like HBO Showtime has their movies on demand, obviously, and there's  a lot to choose from already.  Yeah.  You know, especially the old titles.  You would only go to Blockbuster for a new movie at this point. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, and that's where I think the iPod's going to do, the video iPod's going to do well.  Because, you know, somebody will be saying something about a show, oh, you can go download  it.  But the thing that sucks about the iPod is just when you buy one, the next day, the better  one comes.  Yeah.  The next generation.  Well, that's with all this dumb technology.  I need a new phone.  I don't know.  Do I buy one now?  Do I wait two weeks?  With this stuff, you have to just buy it right when you need it or want it.  And just not worry about it, right?  It's just, yeah.  And commercial radio is pushing the shit out of this HD radio. 
[02:48:30]  You know, they're going to have like a high-definite radio.  Yeah, I don't even get what that's about.  Great, because you could really hear how much it sucks.  Yeah, high-definition radio.  That's the only, that's like the last selling point regular radio has.  They're kind of, well, wait, we got high-definition radio.  When they start talking about that shit, they're just basically saying, look, yeah, we don't  have anything to offer.  We don't have any real programming.  No content.  Yeah, but it'll sound good.  Hear 19 minutes of commercial and spectacular clarity.  And if I'm going to buy a new radio, I'm going to buy a MiFi. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  You know?  Or MiFi.  Something new.  I mean, the sales on the portable satellite radios this holiday season, it's going to  be, you watch the numbers, because you've got the MiFi, you've got the Tau, and you've  got the, I forget the other one.  I want to give them a plug, too.  Is it the Panasonic one?  I don't remember, but we have three, and they're just going to sell out crazy.  What are you guys doing at Digital Life?  Just signing autographs?  Yeah, we just sit at the XM booth, and people come up, and we sign our picture.  And take pictures, and then we take some pictures with people.  Look around a little bit and get the hell out of there.  How big is the XM booth? 
[02:49:30]  They weren't even there last year.  Really?  Thank you.  We were there.  Yeah, we were there.  Yeah, we were there.  How were you?  I think so.  I hope they were there, because we were.  Yeah, that's the thing.  Can I ask, how many times does the fucking record industry want to get paid on the same  song?  It's like, how many times you buy a stupid cassette, you bought the CD, the anthologies,  the fucking best ofs.  It's like, not that the artists don't deserve to get paid, it's like, but man, I bought the  same song four times already.  Enough.  And the new thing that is happening, the Foo Fighters record, I think Coldplay did  it, is copy protection, copy and protection. 
[02:50:00]  Right, where you cannot rip it to your iPod.  And that's bullshit, because you're buying it, like Jimmy said, you're buying it, and  now you just want to get it on your iPod so you can listen to the record as you're out  and about.  That's all that is for the most part.  Most people are now buying their music again.  And meanwhile, as these guys are...  And they want to get paid twice, so then there was a loophole where you could get around  the copy protection, but now they're really starting to play ball, some of these record  companies, they're all just starting to get this copy protection on there.  And it's like you buy it, you want to burn it.  It was like burning it to a cassette years ago.  It's like you want to put it on your iPod. 
[02:50:30]  Now they're telling you what you can carry around to listen to?  It's ridiculous.  You watch.  You watch.  Maybe as soon as next year, most of the freaking CDs that come out, I bet you they're all  going to be copy protected, because that's the new direction they're going in, because  they see another revenue stream.  You buy the CD at Tower Records or whatever, and then now you're going to have to buy it again  online to get it into your iPod, because the iPod is so popular.  And don't forget the ringtone.  You know, a lot of people buy ringtones.  There's software you can pay like 20 bucks and take your music and make ringtones out  of it.  Yeah.  Eventually what's going to happen is, at least I hope this happens, because now they're 
[02:51:00]  getting greedy.  And I was always for Lars.  I thought he got a bad rap.  He was trying to just get paid on stuff that was being stolen.  People are going to go back to Kazaa and LimeWire and start stealing shit that's copy protected.  It's like, you know what?  I just bought this.  I can't put it on my iPod.  Fuck you.  I'm going to go online and just grab it.  And then all the people that didn't buy it are going to grab it.  So these stupid asses, I'm starting to pay for music.  Like, I don't want to rip you off.  Even stuff that I stole at one point, I've re-bought, because the quality is better from  my iPod.  It's also, I like to pay the artists.  But they're getting just greedy, man.  Well, they're coming back in the game. 
[02:51:30]  They were losing a lot of money.  Now they're figuring out how to make more money.  Yeah.  And they're getting greedy again.  As these record companies are saying that they should get a piece of iPod sales, a device  they tried to squash, like, I don't know, the VCR, the cassette tape, the DAT tape,  the Burnable CD.  Yeah.  The artists are still getting, like, crap.  Yeah.  The artists still are at the bottom of the food chain.  Right.  Hey, can I have the cheap codes for GTA?  I want to see the sex scenes, by the way.  The PC version?  For PlayStation 2.  Oh.  I don't know if you can do it for the PlayStation 2. 
[02:52:00]  You can't do it for PlayStation 2?  No?  No.  I've been meaning to ask you that for a while.  PC only.  All right.  And the new version of the game's coming out this fall?  Huh?  No.  The new version's coming out this fall?  GTA?  GTA for PSP comes out.  But I mean all the ones they took out of the stores.  Oh, yeah.  That's already back out.  Oh, they're back on the shelves all cleaned up?  Yeah.  They took that code out that was on the cutting room floor, and somebody put it back together  again.  Great.  All right.  But, yeah, GTA, there's a new title for the PSP that comes out later this month. 
[02:52:30]  Okay.  Hold on a second.  Patrice O'Neal overslept, and we're trying to do him a favor today.  Patrice?  Hello?  You overslept?  Who's this?  Oh, wow.  Patrice.  Yo.  What's up?  I'm sorry, man.  Hey, listen.  I apologize, dude.  I mean, y'all was doing me a favor.  I just wanted to come in and, you know, I bought a new alarm clock, dude, that plays like  ocean waves instead of, like, buzzing or whatever.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  And I just, man, I've been, like, I don't know, dude.  I just got, I slept like, you know, you get into that fucked up coma sleep, dude.  I just, my eyes woke up at 10, and I was jumping up.  It plays ocean waves.  What, did you dream that you were washed up?  They were trying to, people were trying to throw water on you?  Is that Jimmy?  Yeah, it certainly is.  Wide awake.  I'm too tired to tell you you ain't shit, but I've got enough energy.  Well, dream it.  Go back to sleep.  I saw you on Leno. 
[02:53:30]  I thought Jimmy was fantastic on the couch.  Is that, am I able to say that?  Yes, yes.  I thought Jimmy was excellent on the couch.  I really did, Jimmy.  You and your dumb acting skills, they were pretty good.  Thank you.  You was, you know, but one day, that cute, mushy, pervert thing that you got going on,  I really hope one of these actors just slapped the shit out of you.  So do I.  It would make every entertainment show.  It's not a cute, mushy, pervert thing.  It's my awful life.  I just hope she slaps you and all the entire left side of your face just spreads out like 
[02:54:00]  one of those cartoons.  Right now.  I really.  Go ahead.  Never mind, fellas.  I ain't doing shit.  I ain't saying shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm fucking so tired, man.  Get back to that sharper image catalog.  Were you up all night fucking some poor girl who just wants to be held on a  dildo swing?  No.  I'm in love with my girl now.  I told you, dude.  I don't cheat no more and shit.  Okay.  I'm in love. 
[02:54:30]  I'm trying to do right.  Even though that damn, that chair, boy, we did have a good time.  I almost came inside of a, for the first time.  The liberator, yeah.  Yep.  The sex couch.  You're loving the liberator, right?  Oh, the liberator is, I'm not even bullshitting, man.  It almost, it's like I, it almost came, you know.  I never almost come in.  I always pull out and try to violate a civil rights, you know, just spray it down a little  bit.  And, um. 
[02:55:00]  Hey, was she on the pill or no?  What?  Is she on the pill?  Nah, she wants, she wants to get married and have kids with me, man.  So I got to always control my destiny, you know what I mean?  I always got to do a porn style, but sometimes I, sometimes I get into it, it feels so good.  I just, like, as, here's how I disconnect it, and sometimes it's like, while I'm doing  it, I'm arguing with myself, like, look, man, you're 35, maybe you should have a kid.  Nah, maybe you should not, fuck it, eh. 
[02:55:30]  And then, like, right now the evil is, you know, the dark side is winning most of the  time where it's like, you know what, pull out, nigga, get her.  And it's like, I go in between, alright, I love this girl, I'm gonna get her pregnant,  or I'm gonna get it all over her face.  And, uh, getting it on her face is winning, but it's, I'm, I'm becoming, I'm becoming less  disgusted, you know what I mean?  Sometimes I just do it on a shoulder blade, or, oh, I love her so much, I'm gonna put it  on her hip.  Slowly working your way down to the womb? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, slowly, like, getting connected, like, trying to have a kid.  Uh, and I think I might.  Oh my god, he's gonna be a father within the year.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  You're not, you're not emotionally built to be a father.  Every time you make money, you buy watches, and then you're broke.  You're not, you're not prepared emotionally to give to a child.  I really am an ass, I, I, you know, I, I really am a dick when it comes to that kind 
[02:56:30]  of shit, man.  You fly below the equator to pay poor women to suck your dick.  You're not ready to give love.  You know what, though?  I don't like the way Jim just won't allow anybody.  I tell you, though, our little crew, Jim, I just wanted to say on the radio, we had a  nice run.  Now everyone's admitting that, that there's a crew.  I love that.  It was a crew.  It was, it was me, Jimmy.  No, it's every man for themselves.  Jimmy's doing just fine without you guys.  You know what, that bitch, Bonnie, she's the Yoko Ono of comedy. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, we haven't heard from Voss in a long time.  He's not, because he, Voss, Bonnie has, those coffee shop people in L.A. hired Bonnie to  destroy us.  They did not like loud assholes getting national prominence.  And they went, she was hired by Comedy Central to go out with the weakest member of the  crew, which was Voss, and whisper in his ear. 
[02:57:30]  And everything Voss says now, it's like he, you know somebody else said it to him in his  ear.  Yeah.  I told you, I told you, Norton, you know you're the only one invited to his wedding.  You know he called everybody and said, why don't you bring a gift?  Yeah.  I told you to the wedding, you know, and like, I was like, well, we're not traditional  fucking friends.  Like, we're not, like, we're not square friends.  Like, how do you, how do you, like, ask me to bring you a gift to your, your makeshift  Caroline's reception and then, like, not invite me to the wedding? 
[02:58:00]  Like, I said, you got some fucking nerve you didn't invite me to the wedding, asshole.  And then, and then ask me for, oh, you know, I thought you were a friend and I thought  we were good buddies.  Oh, really?  Did you?  And he goes, oh, I didn't write to the wedding.  I didn't want to bother you.  Well, why are you bothering me now?  You dick.  Would you have flown to the, would you have flown all the way up into Edmonton to go to  his wedding?  That's not the point.  But, but would you have done it?  I would have found some type of excuse not to go. 
[02:58:30]  I would have not went to that stupid wedding in Canada because I don't condone it.  Um, but I think, you know, being invited would have been, would have been the point.  Like, then, then he could have said something to me like, Hey, you know, you didn't bring  things.  And then he had, I had to curse him out because I know that wasn't him talking.  As soon as he got on the phone, he goes, Hey, everybody, you know, or, oh no, to me,  he goes, I know you're going to trash me for this.  And I don't want to trash me, but I'm going to get it off my chest.  When the fuck did Voss start speaking that, that, that alcohol is anonymous and that drug, 
[02:59:00]  that's that shit they used to say in the drug meetings, you know, Hey, you know, he, he's  starting to become civilized and people see people don't understand something about being  with a woman and especially a woman comic, women comics.  The only way they find you attractive is if they think you're better than them.  You know what I'm saying?  They, cause they look at you on that, that level, like, wow, he's like this guy, this,  he's like on the TV. 
[02:59:30]  But once they look at you like an idiot, they dump you hardcore.  So it's like Bonnie no longer looks at Voss.  Okay.  Terrific.  Hello?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You don't think she respects him?  No, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  I missed that.  I missed what you said, Anthony, man.  I didn't say anything.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm reading instant feedback and you're really losing momentum. 
[03:00:00]  Jay from Philly.  Wow.  A black guy missing work.  Who saw that one coming?  Things are, things are turning.  Did, uh, did Opie say boring?  I didn't say boring to you.  No, sir.  No, you didn't say boring.  Hey, uh, Patrice, there was a reason why you were coming in today.  What was that reason?  Oh, I'm a...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, you didn't.  Oof.  Now, he needs a good plug because he's, uh, he's doing Greg, uh, Caroline's a big favorite 
[03:00:30]  today.  He's going to be at Caroline's all weekend?  Yeah.  I guess, I don't know what he's doing Sunday, but I know what he's doing tonight, tomorrow.  It was supposed to be Tracy Morgan, but something happened with Tracy, some TV thing or whatever.  So, uh, Greg called up Patrice.  So, uh, Patrice is stepping up big time.  So, uh, Patrice and Caroline's all weekend long.  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neal, very funny guy.  Really.  Really funny.  Let's, uh, say hi to Bob Kelly.  Ooh.  Bob.  Yeah.  Hi, Bob.  Hey, Bob.  That fucking jackass he is.  Who, Patrice?  Uh, you know, I just told my girlfriend the other day, I know, I love when he calls me 
[03:01:00]  when I have a road gig when I'm driving, because I know he'll take up three and a half  hours at a time.  He's like, talk radio, personal.  Patrice.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I did what I did to you, but, uh, Bob Kelly just called you, what?  What'd you call him?  I said, I love when you call me on the road.  No, you called him a what before that?  Talk, human talk radio.  No.  A yard ape?  I think you called him an ass or something.  An ass?  I, oh, an ass.  I didn't say yard ape. 
[03:01:30]  Can you hear me?  Yeah, we can.  Yeah, we can all hear each other.  Yeah, you, you know, that's the thing that we gotta, we just don't, this is, this, we  have to start loving each other, fellas.  Well, excuse me, excuse me, hold on a second, fucking Mr. Zen.  When I, when I was in L.A. a couple weeks ago, piece of shit, who did I call and practically  begged to hang out with me and fucking, uh, hey, uh, I'll call you back and I fucking  never heard from you again.  I was alone and I needed some friends.  Yeah, who was the guy, so, who was the guy when I woke up with my girlfriend and I was 
[03:02:00]  like, you know what, I'm gonna stop fucking around, I'm gonna be a nice guy trying to  change my life.  Who called me a fat loser and said I'll never change?  Everyone.  And that's, I, I called you that, I called you that before you broke up, huh?  See, see, that's why there'll never be loved, cause you all change, you, you fucking switch  it up like sharks.  I tell you you're on my side, Norton, and you come right back at me. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, Bob.  What?  How many people were at the Helium Comedy Club last night?  Oh, last night.  They were there to see me?  Yeah.  Well, uh, there was, mm, five, but, uh, one of them got food poisoning during my set in  the middle of my act and had to leave with the two other friends, so it ended up being  two.  So which, which one of your jokes did he eat? 
[03:03:00]  That's why.  But Bob, as, as you said, food poisoning during your act, everyone's going, how do I tie this  in and hurt you with it?  You really are a piece of shit.  Bob Kelly, we played your, we played the voicemail you left for Jimmy Norton.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And then, well, you had 22 people, and then we played your plug, which you didn't name 
[03:03:30]  the city in.  I'm such a fucking idiot.  You just said the Helium Comedy Club.  This is a national talk show.  No one, no one knew where to go.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah, Patrice, that's true.  He just said the Helium Comedy Club, like it's fucking Madison Square Garden or the Felt  Forum.  He called it, he called it the H.  No one makes it worse, even if the people in Philly knew it was the Helium, there's  no way they would know because it's a brand new place. 
[03:04:00]  Brand new.  No number.  Even the people in Philly couldn't even make that connection.  Well, I get nervous in the room with Steve.  Well, gotta give him that.  I mean, I suck.  Dude, you gotta give the number out, too.  How are you gonna give the number out?  I fucking don't know how to do this shit.  That's why, but you know the thing, it's like Norton, man.  Thank you, you know, OB, thank you for making Norton into like a showbiz person, because I 
[03:04:30]  know that what he just said to Bobby, dude, you gotta do this and this.  You said that to him when he was fucking an idiot.  You just got successful last week, Norton.  Listen, you don't have to be on the cover of Entertainment Weekly to know to give out  a fucking phone number during a plug.  This is not inside information that when you're plugging a gig, you mention the number or the  city.  It is weird when you're like an innate loser. 
[03:05:00]  I'm the same way.  I hate plugging stuff.  Like, look, man, I hate plugging shit.  I'm not an expert at it.  I'm the dumbest plug, like, I've missed six plugs since I've been on an OP show, and  it's like, I go, he goes, hey, so where are you gonna be?  I'm like, ah, you know, and then it's like, sorry, the show's over.  I'm like, oh, shit.  I just, uh.  You're intentional, dummy.  Say that again?  They do that intentionally.  No, we don't.  We actually, I mean.  No, in the end, we appreciate what you guys do for us, and we want to get the plugs in. 
[03:05:30]  That's when we get down to serious business.  Yeah, we give you all the other shit, you know, we'll smash each other, but we know the  end game is to get people in the seats for you guys, because you help us out.  Yeah, Bob.  So I'm gonna defend myself.  Wow.  Bobby.  And Bob, we, Bob, you were on the show for two days.  We walked you down into the production room, said, now you do a promo, we're gonna run  this like crazy, and you were the dummy that didn't know the fucking city.  That's right.  Oh.  God, you fat fucker.  How about that?  How about that, fat ass?  Oh, no, good one, good one, O. 
[03:06:00]  No, no, Opie, Anthony, hey, why don't you jump in, Anthony, because I'm hanging out the  fucking window right now.  I was just, I'm kind of agreeing with the fact that you should have at least put the hemisphere  that the club was in, you know, something there.  Dude, the helium, it's above the equator.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Give us a latitude and longitude parallel.  Well, yeah, that's one thing I won't accept, we're friends with all you guys, and in the  end, we do want to, you know, help you guys out as much as we can. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, I don't think...  It's not our problem to sit there and, you know, tell you where you're, ask you where  you're gonna be every five minutes, so you gotta work it in.  Yeah.  You're right, and, but, you know, all, you know, all of a sudden, look, nobody I know  in terms of comics, you know, running down, the trickling down theory, nobody's that  great, like, everybody, you know where everybody's copying from is that goddamn Dane  Cook.  Everybody I know is trying to be goddamn Dane Cook all of a sudden, because when he  saw those CDs, that shit changed, like, the way comedy, it destroyed comedy. 
[03:07:00]  Now everybody's trying to put out this dumb CD, hey, I'm a little white wormy guy, you  know, volume two with two CDs set of fucking I'm a smushy little cracker, and hey, now I  look like Tura Tanaka, fucking Bobby's new stupid CD.  Everybody's trying to push a CD and be a plugger, and be a this and that, and I'm on the way  to doing it, too, because I'm like, okay, that's maybe how you gotta do it, but I hate 
[03:07:30]  peddling myself.  Hey, come see me, and I'm a funny guy.  I'm under this illusion that people just wanna come to fucking see me because they heard  I was funny, but it ain't working.  So now I gotta goddamn say, hey, come on down to, you know, blue, blah, blah, blah, blah,  like, sound like a morning zoo guy and shit, you know what I'm saying?  Patrice, that would've been a perfect opportunity to actually say Caroline's.  Say Caroline's.  Blue, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  Jesus.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Why don't you guys try to help me?  Patrice will be at Caroline's all weekend long for Tracy Morgan. 
[03:08:00]  He's a very funny guy.  That's right.  Patrice will be at Caroline's on Broadway.  I wanna read this from Big Moose in Philly.  He goes, I know that helium is in Philly.  I heard that Bob Kelly was there, and even though it was raining and windy, I didn't care.  I got my umbrella and went to the electric factory to see Bill Burr.  Alright, listen, we got lots of show to do, so we gotta cut you guys short.  Patrice O'Neal's gonna be at Caroline's.  Patrice will be in for Jimmy a couple days next week. 
[03:08:30]  Bob Kelly will not be in for Jimmy next week at all.  Oh, why can't Bob stop by?  Bob?  Bob's just sitting there hoping, wanting.  Bob?  Listening very closely for the answer.  Yeah, Bob wants to clear his throat, but he doesn't want to break the silence.  Bob's done a fantastic job on our show.  We love Bob.  Bob, Helium Comedy Club in Philadelphia.  Bob, do you get a number for the club?  Yes, I do.  215-496-9001.  Alright, and Bob, listen to the replay. 
[03:09:00]  I was telling everyone how you killed, as you were warming up for Dane Cook, and you  should have had a lot more people at the Helium Club in Philly.  I like Opie.  Opie.  Opie's a slam.  I like Opie.  And he hangs up on him.  Thank you for letting me plug Caroline.  Alright, we'll see you next week, Patrice, okay?  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100 for tickets.  Go see Patrice.  Are you there Sunday, too, or just tonight, tomorrow?  You can answer.  No, he's going to hang on. 
[03:09:30]  I actually wanted to ask him.  Yeah, you really wanted to know.  Because when it comes to that, we take it seriously.  Yeah, it was a real question.  Yeah, because we make fun of Voss' acting and stuff, but the fact is, he does a very,  very good job.  Yeah.  You know, we don't want to confuse the two.  We like to smash him, but we also want people to go see Voss when he's doing his thing  as well.  Laszlo, did Ben tell you how my show's being sabotaged because of my association with you  guys?  Of course it is.  Yeah.  I got a call two days ago from K-Rock.  Yeah, Laszlo is on Howard Stern's station here in New York on weekends, right? 
[03:10:00]  Right, you have a weekly talk show from 6 to 10 on Sundays, and I got a call saying  that Opie and Anthony stickers are showing up around the station.  Uh-oh.  And I don't even own any Opie and Anthony stickers, so there's no temptation there to  sticker bomb.  And so, I said, well, it wasn't us.  The only sticker that ever went up was put up by Eric when he came on the show, and he  put it on the sticker door, and they got ripped down.  And now, and he said, well, also, somebody's going into the studios and moving the clocks  around.  I go, what studios?  Well, Howard's people are saying that somebody's going into the studios and moving stuff around 
[03:10:30]  in there.  And they're blaming you because of the association with us.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And I said, well, his studio's locked, and I got better shit to do than go fuck around in  his studio.  Why would you turn the clock?  It's not really 6.15.  Tee-hee.  What, you saboteur?  I couldn't believe this conversation that I was having on the phone.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  Wow.  They are paranoid.  Like, Stern's guys are blaming me for, like, fucking with shit in their studio.  A little paranoid.  Well, he's going to be on satellite soon, and we're all just so scared. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, what are we going to do next?  I feel like he's doing a great job, though.  Don't promote the replacements.  Don't name them.  Because I don't know what the fuck to do.  Yeah, last Sunday.  It's not me with the poker chips.  It's Opie.  All right, sorry.  Enough with the fucking poker chips.  It sounds like you're in a fucking poker room when you're flipping them on the fucking  console.  Sorry about that.  Sorry, sorry.  It's me.  Vanilla Thunder in Philly here.  Sorry, sorry.  You're pissing them off.  Yeah, they don't know what they're doing.  They even talked to us.  They've talked to everybody.  They were trying to figure out how we could do something for them.  It's October, and they have not mentioned who's doing it or started to promote the person. 
[03:11:30]  What an abominable job.  Last Sunday, I was saying that the station's going religious, that they've been backpedaling  and backpedaling to the religious right so much that K-Rock's finally just going to  go Christian.  Corey from Florida.  Corey from Florida.  Great line.  He goes, Howard just wants him to turn the clock back about 10 years.  Bravo.  That's the Howard we would be scared of.  Because everybody over there is so bugging, like, you know, what's going to replace Howard? 
[03:12:00]  What are you going to do?  And there's like these stupid New York message or radio message boards.  People are like, oh, is Lazlo going to replace Howard?  And all this horse shit.  So on Sunday, I said that we're playing some new production for the new format.  Because there's also rumors that the station's just going to completely flip format.  Yeah.  So I said that it's going to become a religious station, but it's going to have that top 40  slash rock production sensibility.  Infinity's going to be just fine without Howard.  Sirius Satellite Radio is in deep shit with Howard. 
[03:12:30]  Deep shit.  They didn't know what they got into.  They got some serious bills to pay.  The business has grown so much since they signed Howard, that deal does not make sense on  any level.  Yeah, but you can download shows on the portable unit and listen to them, but not live.  Yeah, they got a portable unit that doesn't get live programming.  No live programming.  They're bragging about that.  That's great.  The Wi-Fi's been out how long?  Repeaters.  I don't know.  About a year, maybe?  A little over a year.  About a year.  We got it for Christmas last year.  And they still do not have a handheld device that can get their live broadcast. 
[03:13:00]  They have to wear like a backpack radio, like a World War II radio man.  Yeah.  Radio man.  You've got to look like that.  Wind it up.  Big antenna sticking out.  People will be shooting at you.  It's a lovely fucking war, gentlemen.  Well, don't they have no repeaters?  That's why?  XM has like, you know, a thousand.  They have like three.  Yeah, well, we're just way ahead of the game.  And this satellite radio thing is much bigger than any of us.  You know, Ant and I and Jimmy, we'd like to think that we're carrying XM at this point. 
[03:13:30]  We're not.  We're doing very well for them.  We're turning on a lot of people to satellite radio.  But the fact is, it is so much bigger than us.  So much bigger.  And Howard and Sirius think it's all about one show, and that's the mistake they're making.  We're one of the many stars.  Which you see in the XM sky.  Not only are we not carrying them, but we all have our hands wrapped around Kyle Ripken's cock, and he's dragging us.  All right, so you've got some fake promos?  Yeah, I said there's a new morning show that's coming on in January. 
[03:14:00]  Oops.  Oh, no.  Guys, it's fine.  Let's all come down.  Even Laszlo plugs his show better than those two dipshits.  True.  Got the time, the day, everything.  Hey, I put the CD in upside down.  You put it in upside down?  Yes, I did.  And there's a big label.  One whole side of the CD is taken up with this big painted label.  See, I take my beating as well, Eric.  Do you see?  Eric, how is that your fault?  I'm a dope sometimes, too.  And how is that a beating?  Oh, shucks.  Look what I did, guys.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:14:30]  See, Eric, I hurt myself as much as you.  Wow, what a thrashing.  That was just as bad as Eric got earlier.  And I'm instantly thinking that I put the label on the wrong side.  Like a jackass.  All right, here we go.  That was not an Eric-like beating.  No.  You didn't scream, hey, asshole, who put the fucking CD in upside down?  But do you guys understand?  I didn't have to share my stupidity with you guys.  Oh, put it in upside down!  I could have covered it up and said, oh, oops, I didn't touch it in.  I did not have to share my stupidity there.  You did share it very lightheartedly. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, guys, look at this.  Oop-deed-oop.  Look at me.  Silly me.  Oops.  KRST.  With Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the morning.  So that's the, so we're saying it's changing the color.  Wow.  KRST.  And then there's an imaging statement.  Oh, like Christ.  Okay.  I had to spell it out.  Spice with a K.  More Jesus.  Less Satan.  KRST.  The Rock Revolution.  I mean, Revelation. 
[03:15:30]  So that was an imaging station.  That's really funny, having a Christian station with all that type of production.  That is great.  And I said, you know, every station needs, like, a big contest promo.  Because, you know, the radio station, you know, B-Caller 28.  Right.  So here's one for the new Christian station that K-Rock's going to turn into.  K-R-S-T, Christ Radio.  Listen to the sound of Terry Scheibel.  When you hear it, Caller 12 instantly wins a Jesus prize pass.  You'll get a holy water bottle.  Crown of Thorns iPod headphones.  A Walmart shopping spree.  And pre-tickets to the third annual Salvation Fest. 
[03:16:00]  November 23rd at the Thrifty Car Rental Stadium in Mobile, Alabama.  F-K-R-S-T, like Jesus, we're back again.  Wow.  Wow.  Crown of Thorns.  iPod headphones.  Oh, I didn't even chat that.  That is really good.  We've got to play that a few times.  Damn.  We'll keep that for next week.  We've got to move along because we've got Rob Dibble calling the show.  Laszlo, of course, to hang out.  We've got Big A that's going to end the show today with monologue jokes from Jay Leno and David Letterman. 
[03:16:30]  The best scene was Big A walked up to Master Poe and he goes,  Master Poe, can I...  And Poe goes, bathroom key?  Yeah.  Oh, you know?  He's doing like this little pee dance out there.  Oh, I'm sure it wasn't the little pee dance.  No, no, he has the body of Peter Griffin.  Cartoon character, Jimmy.  Oh, that's actually a good one, Jimmy.  I know.  I just don't know who Peter Griffin is.  I'm going to have to pound myself.  No, it's Jimmy's pop culture.  That's a little lacking, yes. 
[03:17:00]  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy, Anthony.  We love Joey.  We love his restaurant.  We love the whole Little Italy thing.  Who had a great dinner date down there.  Big A in Stalker Patty.  Right.  Right there at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  They're a classic candlelit restaurant down there.  Perfect for a late night date.  Romantic meal.  Every single pasta on the menu.  Now under ten bucks.  And at Paisano, you mentioned XM Radio.  What are you going to get?  That free glass of wine.  Ah, salute.  Authentic Italian cuisine made from old world Italian recipes. 
[03:17:30]  And all the fun and romance of Italy.  In a friendly restaurant.  That's Paisano of Mulberry Street.  They're open weekends until 2 a.m.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Between Grand and Hester.  Call them.  212-965-1188.  965-1188.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance.  Opie and Anthony.  It's great.  I like the hottest guys on radio.  Wow, that's really nice.  Really nice.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines.  Opie and Anthony show on XM Radio. 
[03:18:00]  Very nice.  Test tested.  Leno approved.  They plugged us like three times last night.  Yep.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The hottest show they did.  The hottest show they did.  The hottest show they did.  All right, let's get right back into the show and say hi to one of our pals, Rob Dibble.  Rob, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  There he is. 
[03:18:30]  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from L.A.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  You have that I-just-woke-up voice.  I guess everyone's talking about the thing, the catch, the strike, the bum call.  The bum call.  Yeah, you know what?  But that's not an unusual play.  That's what's so funny is baseball has that play five times a game.  And just because it was at the end of a game, everybody's making a big deal about it. 
[03:19:00]  But, you know, I still contend that that wasn't the end of the game.  The end of the game was the stolen base, and then the base hit.  Right.  And everybody's like, well, it was the strikeout.  No, no, it wasn't.  You know, the pitcher just didn't do his job.  That's the bottom line.  But, Rob, what did you think?  Did he actually-to me it looked like he caught the ball and then just kind of rolled it out  like a catch it does.  Did he actually catch it or do you think he trapped it?  I think he caught it.  I think he caught it.  You know, Kevin and I talked to Larry Barnett, a guy who's done seven American League 
[03:19:30]  championship series in his career.  He holds the record.  And he was actually the one that was involved in the Arm Brewster deal in 75 with Carlton Fisk.  And, you know, he was talking about how catchers will let you know if they caught it or not.  And had he not caught it and trapped it, he would have tagged them.  Right.  And because, you know, catchers are just so used to that.  So, in Josh Paul's mind, he caught the ball.  He just rolled it back out to the mound.  And so, you know, the umpire screwed up. 
[03:20:00]  But why are they never accountable?  I know the pitcher didn't do his job and they all blow calls.  But why are umpires never held accountable for their awful-  I mean, if you don't hit, you sit or you're throwing off the team.  Why are they not held accountable for sucking?  Well, I mean, because, you know, referees and umpires, whether it's basketball or hockey  or whatever, I mean, they're just supposed to be people that adjudicate the game.  And, you know, it's not like they're actually part of the game.  Umpires over the years have tried to become more part of baseball.  And then, when they put them all under one umbrella, I liked it better when you had American League umpires 
[03:20:30]  and National League umpires because they kind of were competitive.  And when it got to the playoffs and stuff, they were almost sharper and they had an edge.  And now, you know, they're all under one umbrella and it's kind of a universal umpiring crew.  And you've got American League and National League umpires that are mixed into the crews.  I mean, it's just, you know, I've seen some really bad umpiring during the playoffs.  And that's disappointing because these guys used to be so sharp and had an edge about them.  And it's just not like that anymore. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, should we incorporate the instant replay?  No, absolutely not.  That's garbage.  I think it sucks in football.  Because they don't know how to use it right.  I mean, no, I mean, and the thing in football, it makes it, it slows it down and becomes too technical.  And that's the thing I don't like about it.  And so, with baseball, if you were to stop a baseball game, it's already three hours long, three and a half hours long.  I mean, people would really get turned off by it.  And the fans are really coming back to baseball.  So, I think it's just, you know what, they have to have, like you said, they have to be held accountable. 
[03:21:30]  And, you know, there's got to be, like, they instituted this a few years ago.  And Sandy Allerson Jr., who went back to baseball, and he's now at the San Diego Padres,  when he took over the umpiring crew with MLB Baseball, you know, he really did this where they get together  and they get the call right kind of stuff.  But they really need to have it like the NFL.  Well, the NFL referees are held accountable because they have, like, a panel of referees 
[03:22:00]  that look every week at how these guys did on Sunday.  And that's what Major League Baseball has to do, that when these guys aren't good,  that they either have, like, some way to judge them, and then they don't go to the playoffs.  And I think that's the way you're going to make umpiring better.  I've got to say, too, I disagree.  I think that fans watch the game, whether it's football or baseball.  If instant replay, like Ope said, is overused, then it's no good.  But no fan is going to get mad if there's an extra ten minutes on the game and the calls are right.  Fans watch the calls right. 
[03:22:30]  Especially when it's a very, very important call, like the other night.  Absolutely.  Or when it's a touchdown catch in football.  I mean, when you can call somebody a season because you're not doing your job,  and everything's more technical.  I mean, the way they scout each other, everything is more technical now,  and umpiring has not caught up.  And we were talking about this today, like, you know, yeah, there's a team that might win the World Series  because of a bad call now, all right, technically.  I wonder if the...  Yeah, but you know what?  You can go back and you can look at the Yankee game and the Robinson Cano play at first base  where Joe West called him out. 
[03:23:00]  That would have been bases loaded for the Yankees.  Right.  So the Yankees are actually sitting home right now because of a call that an umpire made.  Right.  And Kevin Kennedy and I, we both disagree with the call.  That's right.  I agree.  We felt that the defense was awarded for bad play.  You can't award the team bad play and say, well, the rule says this.  You know what, guys, if he had had to run down the proper way to first base,  he would have run Darren Erstad over and killed him.  Right.  Yep.  Darren Erstad was on the right side of the base.  So it's actually, you know, some of the rules in baseball are kind of sketchy, 
[03:23:30]  but, you know, that's the way the game is.  I mean, you've got to live by it.  Hey, are they ever going to try to speed up a play?  I know you said a lot of people coming back to baseball, so why do it?  But it just seems like in this day and age, everything moves a lot faster.  We're all about on demand, and, you know,  we don't want to wait through commercials or anything.  And I just wonder if eventually it's going to hurt baseball.  They have sped it up by about a minute.  I know.  Well, see, I'm a big hockey fan, and, you know, 
[03:24:00]  I was very bitter because of what, you know,  the whole holdout there for last season, whatever.  But I have season tickets to the Islanders.  I went to the first home game.  Man, the game is so much more exciting because they're not blowing the whistle as much  because of some of the dumb rules that they had in place for many years,  you know, the two-line pass and all that.  Yeah, baseball is more difficult.  There's not many more rule changes you can do to make guys.  They've made batters jump in the batter's box.  They've pulled pitchers not to walk around the mound.  You know, maybe you could take away a few pitches in between innings. 
[03:24:30]  They throw, like, seven warm-up pitches, maybe make it five.  Right.  It's always going to drag on because, especially in the National League,  where you have the pitching changes and things like that,  and you have double switches and, you know, the strategy that's involved there.  So it's just, you know, baseball is just a slow sport.  But it's actually a lot easier, I guess, to watch in person because, you know,  you're drinking beers or you're eating hot dogs and you bring your kids.  It's a lot more fun.  But I think that's the same thing about hockey. 
[03:25:00]  I'm a huge hockey fan.  I just have season tickets to the Whalers back east.  Sorry to hear.  And I love going to the games and watching it on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah, without a doubt.  What are you guys talking about on 175 today?  Oh, we'll be talking about last night's National League game.  And, of course, we'll still be talking about the A.J. Brzezinski play  and just getting people up to date.  And then probably a lot of the managerial openings that are still going on.  Man, you guys on sports radio love to run things into the ground.  Absolutely. 
[03:25:30]  Absolutely.  No, and it's your listeners that'll do it.  You know, it should be a five, ten-minute conversation about this missed call,  but they'll still be talking about it Tuesday, you know?  Yeah, but the best part about our show is that we're trying to inform people  and trying to make them understand why the play happened.  Does Clemens win tonight?  Does Clemens win tonight?  I don't know.  I like the Cardinals.  I like the Cardinals.  And I think they're playing tomorrow.  I think they had an off day.  Way to go out on a limb.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I want to ask you a question about the replay, 
[03:26:00]  because a friend of mine is a big proponent of it,  and I'm kind of into it too.  But do you think that, like,  are you saying that, like, a lot of times you think it's going to extend the games,  but the technical aspect kind of, like,  it will remove people from what was, like,  at one point was certainly not in the same kind of, like, you know,  realm because of it.  Yeah.  But it also, the best part about baseball is the human aspect of the umpires.  You know what?  The whole Quest Tech thing has been a miserable failure,  because it's not 100% foolproof. 
[03:26:30]  And the whole strike zone deal and having these cameras in the ballparks  to kind of judge the umpires.  And so I think it's made the umpires more aware that they're being watched  by Big Brother.  To type of sensors.  That instant replay, it's just one more way of taking more power away  from these umpires.  Good.  It's their job.  And I think, you know what?  Umpires were fabulous when I was playing, and they do a great job.  And the human element is the best part about the game.  And you take that away, you know,  then the game just becomes, like, football or hockey or basketball. 
[03:27:00]  And it's just, you know, there's too much technology.  And I think that's just going to ruin it.  It's going to spoil the game.  Hey, finally, when do the Yankees fire Joe Torrey?  They're never going to fire Joe Torrey.  How about Cashman?  No, Cashman will be back.  You really think Torrey's going to be back next year?  Yeah, they owe $13 million.  But, dude, you know.  What about the Lou Piniella thing?  He's just kind of.  Huh?  And straight post-seasons.  And people are.  I understand that.  And he should be there next year.  But you know how baseball is. 
[03:27:30]  He's a good job this year.  You know what?  The starting rotation sucked all year.  And if it wasn't for Cashman bringing in those guys at the end,  they would have failed miserably.  Oh, dude, Cashman stinks.  He stinks.  But do you think George Steinbrenner can see through all that  and realize that that was the real problem this year?  Or does he pull the trigger and bring in Lou Piniella,  who seems to be just kind of hanging out?  No.  No, you can't change.  Mel Stoudemire said it best.  I mean, Joe Torrey did his best job this year in the last 10 years.  Yeah, I would.  You've got to leave him alone.  I hope you're right.  Get those guys in Tampa to leave Brian Cashman alone.  He'll do a better job. 
[03:28:00]  Cashman is only an extension of Steinbrenner.  All he's done is done the crap they did in the 80s,  go out and get over-the-hill pitchers and big bats.  They got rid of Joe Lieber.  I think he's awful.  Bob Watson was the guy, the baseball genius.  And Cashman, I think, stinks.  And A-Rod, a big disappointment there.  Yeah, well, he did a good regular season, though.  I mean, I think they were in the playoffs because of A-Rod.  Yeah, but you've got to perform in the playoffs.  That's why you make the big bucks.  Hey, Rob, you've got a fan, I think.  He wants to know about the rumor. 
[03:28:30]  Did you punch Stuart Scott?  I love Stuart Scott.  He's great.  This guy is obsessed.  Every time you're on, he wants to know if you punched Stuart Scott at an ESPN Christmas party.  No, never.  All right.  I may have kissed him, but I never punched him.  I don't think Rob wants to talk about it.  Sorry, Rob.  Is that the guy from Cincinnati, this guy, the guy that posts from Cincinnati?  I don't know.  Is that where he's from?  I threw it in the garage.  He's got a few questions for you, too, there, Rob. 
[03:29:00]  Our listeners are the worst.  Yeah, yeah, they're really brave.  We're the ones that have to, you know, run into you in Washington one day.  He comments on beating up an old man in a locker room, and what was it like to throw a ball  and hit a woman in the chest?  Wow.  Wow.  You do have some funny listeners.  It always is easy how tough people are when they're on the phone or on the internet.  Yeah.  To tell you the truth, I have no idea what he's talking about, and that's probably the  only reason I was able to actually say that. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, Rob.  Because I did the same thing with, who the hell was on the phone, and I asked a question  that was a little awkward to you guys because I didn't know about it.  Oh, Cal Ripken.  Oh, Cal Ripken.  And the Kevin Costner.  I asked him about the Kevin Costner thing, and everyone turned and looked at me like,  what are you doing?  I'm like, no, I don't know.  I just read it on the board over here.  Yeah, Rob, don't kill the messenger.  Yeah.  I won't.  Thank you, Rob.  We like Rob a lot.  You do the show with Kevin Kennedy on 175, home plate, and you guys are on today from  3 to 6 on the East Coast. 
[03:30:00]  Yep.  All right, Rob.  Thank you.  All right, you guys take care.  All right, there he goes.  Rob Dibble doing us a favor today.  We appreciate that.  Anyone know the ball, the breath story?  I don't know.  I think I already got past that.  She was singing Xanadu, and he threw it.  You could just tell with a...  Yeah.  Oh, your listeners.  I want to fucking kill him.  Where did he get that from?  Fucking people.  Don't leave me alone every time I'm up trying to eat.  Yelling out the ball breast.  Laszlo, as we get Big A in here for the grand finale of the week with Jim Norton. 
[03:30:30]  Jimmy's going back to L.A. tomorrow.  Damn, Jimmy.  So you want to end on a big note, so we got a big guy in studio, Big A.  He's going to do some monologues from The Tonight Show and David Letterman.  Some of the best jokes of the week that Nathaniel could find.  There's 15 jokes.  Dude, we only got like eight minutes left.  We don't have an hour.  Yeah, we'll just do a couple.  How about one?  Laszlo, anything else?  Oh, you turned my mic on.  All right.  It was off.  The whole time?  No, just for a while.  He does that sometimes. 
[03:31:00]  CD was upside down.  It's all right.  CD upside down.  It's cool.  I didn't know you had baseball talk in yet, did you?  I hate baseball.  All right.  It's like the right thing.  A bunch of millionaires running in a circle grabbing their nuts.  Fuck it.  It's hot.  This radio show is.  Good morning.  I have to make a...  Well, no, it's...  Oh, excuse me.  A couple and a thousandaires.  All right.  Anything else though, Laszlo?  I'm good.  We're working on the weekend thing.  I just wanted to acknowledge that to everybody.  We're working on it.  Thank you.  We want to bring you, Elo. 
[03:31:30]  Elo, we want to bring Laszlo aboard.  Keep that regular man image going, Jimmy.  Oh, please.  Just keep that going.  If I ever become a millionaire, it's the first thing I'm going to say every morning.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm a millionaire.  I'll fuck all these regular guys in the mouth.  Believe me.  Believe me, I'm still a regular guy.  There was a mouse in my electric trap this morning.  Oh.  So I'm back to being regular.  You're not regular.  I'm a regular guy.  You're not.  You're just a sociopath with a lot of cash.  I'm a regular guy with a regular apartment, regular girlfriend, regular family, opening up 
[03:32:00]  a family restaurant.  And a ninja bodyguard.  Oh, yeah.  And that.  Big A.  Big A.  Yes.  Hi, Big A.  How are you doing?  Hey, everybody want to come in and watch Big A do some stand-up?  I think we should bring the girls in, too, to let them watch.  Sure.  Bring the girls in.  Ladies.  Who are these ladies?  Who are these girls?  One is a comedian.  I met her.  She's a friend of Jim's from Florentine's, Nicky. 
[03:32:30]  Opie made them wait outside.  I had no idea.  No, that's okay.  They just came in.  I'm Jimmy.  A comedian friend of yours shows up.  And Opie made them wait.  It's all right.  You fuckface.  I didn't know.  This is the grand finale of a week of radio with little Jimmy Norton.  Oh.  We thought we would end the show in style with Big A doing stand-up.  Very comfortable for me.  Glad everybody decided to come in and stand right behind the guy that fucking hates people  standing behind him.  That's nice.  Look at him.  Look at that freaking out.  That's okay.  I feel like I'm like a turtle.  I want to pull my head in. 
[03:33:00]  You see his shoulders are going up.  It's okay.  Sam, just get back a little bit.  Sam has no neck right now.  He's so freaked out.  How are people supposed to stand over there in the corner?  It's a bit of a germaphobe.  Yeah.  No, no.  It's not so much a germaphobe.  I'm a personaphobe.  I just hate people.  He, uh, yeah.  And behind me?  Yeah.  You're crazy people.  Wow.  You all right?  Yeah.  Now I can loosen up.  Holy crap.  We are a bunch of freaks.  All of us.  We got serious problems. 
[03:33:30]  All right.  We got Big A in studio.  This is what's going to happen.  Do we have any music or anything to help this along now?  Like, um, what type of music?  Like, he's delivering a monologue.  It's topical jokes.  Is there kind of...  Oh, do we have the rim shot, maybe?  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  You know, like a comedian would be brought onto for Leno.  Well, who has the rim shot?  Derek?  All right.  Oh, boy, Derek.  As we get ready for this, don't forget, uh, later today, we're going to all be at the  Jacob Javits Convention Center.  It's, uh, thank you, uh, Digital Life Show from 1230 to 130. 
[03:34:00]  We'll be there here in New York City signing all sorts of shit and taking pictures and stuff.  And there's a sticker stop with Danny and Nathaniel at Fright Factory in Philly, 8 to 10, this  Saturday night.  Behind the Ikea.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's only one in Philly, so good luck finding that, people.  Good luck.  You can get handing out wow stickers at a buddy booth at 130.  How are you, Big A?  Okay, not bad.  All right.  Are you a little nervous?  There's a lot of people in here.  Um, yeah, I'm always a little nervous in here. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, there's about 12 people or so in here, so don't be nervous.  And only about a million people listening, so it's not that big of a deal, right?  Of course not.  Only a million or two, right?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  It's raining like crazy here in New York City.  It's been raining for the last 10 or 15 days. 
[03:35:00]  But I want to tell you something.  It's really actually kind of nice in New York City to see puddles for a change that Armin  Man-Made.  Yeah.  Mom!  I love the Lord.  I have to do this now.  Here's that same joke.  It's raining like crazy here in New York City.  It's been raining for the last 10 or 15 days. 
[03:35:30]  But I want to tell you something.  It's really actually kind of nice in New York City to see puddles for a change that aren't  Man-Made.  Okay.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Just like them.  Yeah, sure.  Big A, the next one.  Here's how bad it's raining.  It's...  It's...  It's...  It's...  Yeah.  It starts...  It's...  It's starting to flood now.  And there...  And there was flooding down in Times Square at Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. 
[03:36:00]  A family of Taurvis earlier today was clinging to Jennifer Lopez's ass.  It's a funny joke.  That's a really good joke.  All right.  Go ahead, Big A.  Okay.  Over the weekend, a huge wildfire jumped across the border from Mexico to California.  Here's the really strange part.  Today...  What's that sentence again? 
[03:36:30]  Because he jumped over it.  Yeah.  Here's the really strange part.  Today...  STR is not a problem for him.  Today...  It's just STR.  He got a job at Walmart.  What are the odds?  Give me the crickets on that one.  All right.  Try four.  There's a lot of Columbus Day sales going on. 
[03:37:00]  And I don't know how that happened.  But Columbus Day, a lot of sales.  Everything is on sale.  As a matter of fact, in Times Square, the hookers today are 1492.  Well, I bet that's a Letterman joke.  Yes.  Holy shit, enough with the hookers in Times Square.  1492.  The last time his act was edgy.  There's a lot of Columbus Day sales going on. 
[03:37:30]  And I don't know how that happened.  But Columbus Day and a lot of sales.  And everything is on sale.  As a matter of fact, in Times Square, the hookers today are only 1492.  I forgot the only.  Who transcribed?  Hawk.  Hawk.  Only is a pretty important word in this, I think.  He also spelled border.  Jumped across the border.  He spelled it like snowboarder.  Oh.  You notice that?  Enough with the Times Square hooker jokes, Dave Letterman.  I wonder who did number six, too.  Yeah, you could just tell. 
[03:38:00]  All right, let's do number five there, Big A.  I don't know if you knew this.  Maybe you did.  Maybe you didn't.  China has launched two guys into space.  Were you aware of that?  No.  Like this week, two guys from China are flying around in space.  The mission?  They hope to visit each planet and leave takeout menus. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, that's funny.  Number six.  Listen to this.  eBay is banning the sale of stun guns.  Sounds like someone used one on them right there.  To New Yorkers.  Great.  Now how are we supposed to drop a charging of rat? 
[03:39:00]  That's what I want to know.  Can I ask a question for Than?  Who did number five?  Whose joke is number five?  Why, you want to hear it?  Just curiosity.  I don't know if you knew this.  Maybe you knew this, maybe you didn't.  China has launched two guys into space.  Were you aware of that?  Like this week, two guys from China are flying around in space.  And the mission, they hope to visit each planet and leave takeout menus.  What a racial humor from Dave.  Very surprised. 
[03:39:30]  I want to thank Jim Norton for being on the show this week.  I was happy.  He's going back to L.A. tomorrow and we'll see you in two weeks and you'll be at the Halloween party.  Of course, that whole week.  And HBO is next Friday night.  No, next Friday night, yes.  Believe me, a week from tonight.  Jimmy's half-hour comedy special on HBO.  It's been great having you home, buddy.  Number 14, it'd be great if we could try to read number 14.  All right, let's go with 14 as we end the show.  How about this?  U.S. relief supplies have started arriving in Pakistan. 
[03:40:00]  I'm sorry, we laughed.  You better start over.  I'm really sorry, big guy.  One more time.  One more time.  Go ahead.  How about this?  The U.S. relief supplies have started arriving in Pakistan.  Boy, that's pretty quick, huh?  I think...  I'm out of here. </pre>
