<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts griping about "Get Out of Town Day" conflicting with their work schedule.  Anthony, surprisingly calm after a meditative evening, contrasts this tranquility with his anger towards their underperforming agent and the "bill of goods" they feel they were sold. He vividly describes a torrential thunderstorm, likening it to a scene from *The Poseidon Adventure*.  The conversation then veers into Anthony's dating life, detailing the onslaught of texts from multiple ex-girlfriends reacting to a previous show's segment on his past relationships. He comically likens managing these texts to playing Missile Command, reading aloud several humorous and revealing messages, highlighting the varying degrees of their current relationships – from amicable to a "cold war".

Next, a substantial portion of the show is dedicated to a review of the new Spider-Man movie.  The hosts discuss plot points, special effects (particularly the 3D), and acting performances, comparing them to previous Spider-Man films and other actors.  Specific criticisms regarding pacing and plot are made, transitioning into a discussion of the film's rights issues and reboots within the Marvel universe.  Eric, offering more film expertise, provides context on studio ownership and the reasons behind these reboots.  Character designs and the overall feel of the movie are also evaluated and compared to other films.

The show then shifts gears to Ann Curry's controversial departure from the *Today* show.  Using profanity, the hosts compare the situation to DJ Jazzy Jeff's expulsion from *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air*, speculating on the reasons for her firing, mentioning Matt Lauer's upcoming vacation and the urgency to install a new co-host before the Olympics. Potential replacements, Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, are discussed, alongside gossip about Kotb's on-air wine consumption and Kathy Lee Gifford's husband's past indiscretions.  Numerous tangents ensue, including David Beckham's Olympic exclusion (repeatedly using the "Jazzy Jeffed" metaphor), a humorous anecdote about Roland searching for Hoda Kotb,  a critique of televised soccer, NFL scheduling changes on TBS, the bizarre internet trend "Dick Slang," and a philosophical discussion comparing the unreliability of school-taught facts to current scientific understanding (e.g., the number of galaxies and planets).  The unwatchability of old TV shows like *Happy Days* and *Cannon* is also lamented, leading to further philosophical musings on the vastness of the universe, extraterrestrial life, and parallel universes.  A planned guest, Ian Halpern, cancels due to a film shoot, and Sauce Guy joins the broadcast for the final discussions.

The next segment begins with a discussion of animated films, *Despicable Me* and *Ice Age*, with guest E-Rock participating.  The show then celebrates "Pasta Day" with a pasta delivery, leading to a discussion about sauce preferences (red vs. white, peas included or not).  The Spider-Man movie is revisited, with another guest, Roland, along with a bizarre anecdote about a cinematic "splooging" incident.  This transitions into a lengthy discussion about Hugh Grant's filmography and his infamous arrest.  A listener's theory about multiple universes and the nature of dreams sparks a deep dive into the hosts' own dream experiences, including explicit descriptions of sexual acts.  The "Sunday gravy guys" arrive, providing a sample of their sauce and engaging in promotional talk. Opie then announces his wife's pregnancy with their second child, sparking discussions about baby names, his feelings about having another child (including some less-than-positive comments), and his partner's reaction.  The segment includes random banter, a repetitive bit about "Mimi Beardsley," and a critique of a random video.

The show's final segment focuses on Opie's pregnancy announcement, specifically the reveal that he is expecting a daughter.  The hosts brainstorm baby names, ranging from geographically specific to outlandish options, and engage in humorous, sometimes offensive, speculation about the baby's personality. Opie expresses a preference for another son, leading to discussions about the challenges and anxieties of raising children, including gender dynamics and parental responsibilities, along with the financial implications.  His potential departure from the show is also mentioned. A significant part of the segment is devoted to a colleague, Stanley, who prematurely announced the pregnancy on another show.  Opie's frustration is expressed, followed by Stanley's on-air apology.  This sparks a discussion on race relations, fueled by jokes and comments regarding Stanley's ethnicity.  Opie's future career plans, the merits of higher education, and a humorous anecdote about Jimmy Norton having a meltdown are also discussed. The show concludes with more lighthearted banter involving parenting and drug use, with E-Rock mentioned throughout the segment in relation to Opie’s family life.

[00:06:30]  on i knew the replay was on because my phone just started buzzing uh like crazy and it was a few uh  x's and they're like hey what about me that wanted to know and it was even before what do they want to  know well it was before the replay even started yeah i guess there's a bunch of busy bodies bunch of  busy bodies that listen to the show that are compelled to um dm or text if they have their  number or something my exes to tell them and this is what they told them holy shit anthony's fucking 
[00:07:00]  ripping you apart that's like i didn't rip anyone apart except for my you know ex-wife why would they  do that they want a little piece of the ex either they want that or they want to like they they must  that's how they interpreted what i said or something that's probably their way of trying to  you know trying to get in there get a little piece right trying to why else would you do that  get some sloppy seconds why else would you do that i have no idea but they really had no clue what i was 
[00:07:30]  saying yesterday uh so so i start getting that i'm like no i go listen to the replay i wasn't bashing  oh i i threw a few you know jabs in there but i wasn't sitting there and it wasn't a ex bash fest i  was pretty much bashing myself all right i got it but how many exes texted you okay let me think  one two three three exes four four no come on now you're fucking around four exes texted going what 
[00:08:00]  did you say about me all at the same time as the replay's going on i was i was on my lounge chair  out back by the pool right i had each phone in each hand right and i'm just boom boom back and  forth left hand right hand looking at both of my phones and just answering because some of them have  the other number and some of them have this number so basically you were playing missile command with  your ex it was missile command the side of the old school child of the age that was one of our  games sam yeah missile command it was crazy so so i'm answering what were some of the

[00:09:30]  uh you kept a phone under the mattress  yeah that was a revelation i gather is she to the point where she could laugh at all this stuff  uh yeah because i i noticed like over the years that the exes eventually just laugh at all this  stuff yeah and you end up getting the exes all together for like uh reunion parties and stuff  it it did get to that point yeah i don't know why i got two of these um yeah it was um yeah i can't 
[00:10:00]  believe you have that and then all right kevin from connecticut you're you're kind of clever kevin  oh he goes all my exes sent me texts like that dumb commercial where you could download songs no  matter where you are in the country yeah yeah all right we get it and then i guess she heard the  segment on um nicolini because she goes her family was there then she came back and left in tears and

[00:15:00]  with another girl that was also at my house see i did it again why do you who turned out to be that  lunatic that left me 8 000 fucking voicemails that's who i oh that's who i did see so i never  should have done that it wound up you know costing you costing me a few months of horrid fucking and  they were both at the house at the same time yeah anthony is a douche yes i know i i i am well i was 
[00:15:30]  i'm very i'm much better now birthdays are very important to girls especially apparently they are  you know that right yes what was she hoping to do for her birthday i don't know just hang out maybe  not be dumped for some fucking girl that looked like a seahorse yeah that wasn't that wasn't one of  your better moves no it wasn't you've had some impressive moves over the years but that one was  a little rough i lost yardage on that oh my god i definitely lost yardage that was your van halen with 
[00:16:00]  gary chiron speaking of ways she looked like gary chiron seahorses seashells yep uh yeah yeah so i you know  yesterday's show got me a few um a few texts all right but uh no big fires that was you know no pun  intended no nothing from uh nicolini although she does hear about this stuff people do uh tweet her and 
[00:16:30]  and send messages and stuff but she's all cool with it we've had our we've made our peace  yeah yeah i was just surprised to find out how old she was  i'm gonna hear about that one oh you probably  anyway yeah that was yesterday's show which was terrific yeah that was fun  um we all uh just about the whole place saw spider-man last night yes confused by the spider-man 
[00:17:00]  i didn't see it but eric explained it uh perfectly to me because i didn't understand why they had a  reboot spider-man yeah because the toby mcguire spider-man's the only version right yeah i like  those they were good i had no problem with them maybe the last movie wasn't as good but uh it was  still good enough that they could have continued i believe especially the first one uh that they made  with toby mcguire that was a good you know yeah solid and uh eric why did they reboot because uh the 
[00:17:30]  rights for spider-man moved from one company to another see i don't know this geek stuff and i  gotta be honest with you i'm not i don't give a fuck about this geek stuff i'm not a big fan of  the graphic novel i don't what happened eric the uh the i guess the first three spider-man movie um  were with a a different film company now in this one sony got the rights to it so they needed to  reboot the franchise in order to uh get their merchandising can continue the storylines and do  what they want to do with it so every time uh someone else gets the rights for one of these 
[00:18:00]  uh characters we got to start over that that's what they want we're never going to move forward  because they can't use the the previous movies for their company's promotions and all that other  stuff so they got to redo it all over again and that's what they did we had to start over again  that's what movie makings come to is just and batman's gonna be the same thing we got to start  over again well no we're we're we're good for now but how many times have they rebooted batman  yeah yeah and yeah go ahead didn't sony do the last franchise i think they did what is it disney now 
[00:18:30]  yeah marvel oh now it's marvel picture marvel pictures in association with right because sony  still has uh the rights to spider-man but marvel's trying to marvel slash disney is trying to get all  of that so they can then eventually do spider-man with the avengers and that whole storyline right  now they have to keep it separate i uh to keep the rights from going to disney i guess something like  that yeah well i uh i like the spider-man there right i liked it yeah was it good and um i've said 
[00:19:00]  over the years i don't search out action movies in general uh but i was frustrated because this movie  took forever to get the action going oh yeah didn't he rock yeah they did a lot of uh uh story  set up and resetting from uh how the original first three movies uh were telling the story about peter  parker and his family how he got bit etc they had to redo all of that for that first half of this movie  oh man oh man when you know like the basic gist of the story at this point everyone knows so i 
[00:19:30]  why can't it be one of those like mantages yeah yeah just do a quick montage where it's five minutes  were like oh bit by okay i got it let's go let's move on but no it was a long fucking setup yeah and  his version of getting bit by the spider was different than the toby mcguire version oh well  well i'm sure they have to mix it up a little so you're just not sitting all right we just saw this  usually when they remake a movie it's like 50 years later right so it's like okay they could do it 
[00:20:00]  exactly the same and but yeah now it's reboot everything every five years yeah and the movie itself  in 3d was terrific man like we were discussing 3d the other day three you know they don't they  don't have to tell you 3d yeah it's coming at just kind of it's just kind of there which was awesome  and they got new glasses these glasses seem different than when i went and saw avatar really  and uh now man it doesn't matter where you sit this screen feels like it's three feet in front of  you oh is that yeah that's pretty much remember 3d oh i'm and i'm saying remember meaning like even 
[00:20:30]  just avatar you know the screen was sort of still in the distance but everything was 3d now man they're  moving all that shit even closer to your face yeah they figured it out man when i saw prometheus it  was like same thing it's just huge like like but it was right in front of your face right yeah yeah  yeah yeah you're kind of in the movie and right and the glass is still uncomfortable where i took  them off a couple times and i'm sitting there going wait i could i could pretty much see the 
[00:21:00]  movie remember when you used to take off the 3d glasses everything was kind of fuzzy double image  but i was able to see the movie when i took a break from uh the glasses for a couple minutes here and  there so uh the movie was good it was definitely good the stood the the love story was a little long  we get it two high school kids are oh boy we're getting getting you know in each other's pants  gonna make out a little bit uh like a twilight feel to it uh they were building the love stories  like all right let's go it wasn't go there wasn't the unrequited love story where it wasn't one of 
[00:21:30]  those unrequited love stories where she doesn't really kind of like him like that but he's not  in love they're all in oh really yeah they were ready to bump some uglies yeah she liked him from  the beginning oh see normally there was no real chase there was he awkward or was he like yeah i didn't  awkward he kind of parker's gonna be awkward i didn't feel like he was awkward at all to be  honest with you rock they were trying to go for that angle but he seemed like he was a cool kid 
[00:22:00]  right off the bat and he's handsome is he handsome even when he's not spider-man and stuff and  andrew garfield he's a handsome guy what other movies has he been in facebook he's the facebook  kid yeah eduardo in the facebook all right eduardo yeah he's call me eduardo  is this kind of like uh these vampire movies uh it has a little taste of that a little twilight  taste the hair twilight a little twilight taste where it's just blown up and back oh god oh god 
[00:22:30]  i hate that i don't i don't know i don't know much about guys but he seems a little goofy to me  no he's handsome he's handsome you know what sucks that movie's gonna look dated because of him  like like in a few years when that whole look goes away right it's gonna look like when you  watch movies from the 80s and you know you see guys with the 80s hair right and and chicks with  the 80s hair this is like 2000s 10s hair if you ever try watching singles now where they're all 
[00:23:00]  grunged out uh right right grunge yeah like i think if you watch the toby maguire spider-man  he doesn't have a look when he's peter parker like oh that was the look of that decade right  you know this guy has that look and it's just they don't care though they're they're going for  the money now yeah they don't give a fuck if these movies are are watchable 10 years from now  what sucks we used to like be spoiling assholes and we realized that was we were losing listeners 
[00:23:30]  by the boatload when we did that yeah so it's hard to talk about these movies i saw spider-man i want  to say some shit but you know what what can i say yeah yeah when they got to the action it was  amazing the special effects were really good you go see you're doing the job the 3d was terrific  the lizard was fucking scary someone asked me uh last night because i tweeted right before i went to  bed and whoever you are i apologize i didn't get back to but i had a crash he goes can i take my  five-year-old to this movie and i want to write him back and i think your five-year-old will get 
[00:24:00]  scared when that lizard shows up yeah yeah it was pretty fucking impressive i thought so i thought  it was pretty cool yeah yeah you get uh fear of heights when he's swinging around because they do  a 360 thing where if he's going he'll be in slow motion real just for a little second and then it  goes all around him so you're seeing down like onto seventh avenue and then it shoots back up and  and 3d it's like you're right there it look cool i look cool you think you're falling off the  there was a that's great there was a vastness when he was on top of the buildings and went for 
[00:24:30]  that swinging shit that's fantastic and then he's just in the middle of just this vastness with  these massive buildings around him yeah you know um yeah movie takes place in new york city but they  they they had an extra building did they which is really strange not far from here yeah it's like  it's on this street but somewhere in this area and what did it look like futuristic yeah it was  really strange because you know when you live in new york especially you get to see so many aerial  shots of the buildings and new york in general and pretty much do know every building you almost 
[00:25:00]  it just feels comfortable and and it was kind of uncomfortable because now there's this building  that's you just know is not there how does this one compare to toby mcguire spider-man the first  toby mcguire spider-man oh good question sam it's comparable that was a really good one it's comparable  this one's definitely a little darker dennis leary was great in it he was really good emma stone was  really good but i mean if i'm going to be picky emma stone um seems way too old to be playing a 
[00:25:30]  17 year old oh so that took me out of it a little bit but she's fucking beautiful man she's what  lindsey lohan's supposed to be i guess right oh wow yeah she stepped right into that whole thing i  think that's yeah she's doing all the lindsey lohan parts man and they're probably about the same age  lindsey lohan believe it or not she looks 40 but she's probably 25 26 right tops and emma stone  can't be much younger than that she's probably 22 23 at this point so oh she's 24 emma yeah so 
[00:26:00]  she's almost the same age as lindsey lohan yep holy fucking lindsey lohan looks easily 10 years older  than her huh easily yeah lindsey lohan is 25 holy fuck are you kidding me she's born in 86 so  technically lindsey lohan could have uh been in this movie absolutely and she was uh she was  ridden hard holy fuck that's the old man they're basically the same age my pops used to say that  he'd look at girls that were like that and be like yeah she was ridden hard and put up wet yeah i like 
[00:26:30]  that what does that mean it means when you ride a horse really hard to where they're sweating and then  you put them right in the stall yeah uh they kind of they kind of lame up on you their muscles get all  tight yeah and they start limping and stuff uh you gotta walk your horse around after you ride  them hard uh walk them around in circles and stuff and out in the field until he dries off and then put  them in the stall so if you ride them hard and put them up wet they uh they don't last as long 
[00:27:00]  they're achy they die earlier so you got it's like stretching after a good workout exactly yep ridden  hard and put up wet eroc you're more you're way more of a geek than me and i i don't mean i don't  mean that as an insult you you're into this geek culture i'm not going for a slam right right at  this moment i certainly will get those will come yeah uh but sometimes i need you for real info  like what do you think of the movie because you're probably better at this than me on this one i i  think um if people just ignore some of the love stories in the beginning they're really going to 
[00:27:30]  like the movie marvel seems to be doing this where a lot is set up in the first half and then from  the middle to the end it's just non-stop well anyone that anyone that uh grew up with uh erwin  allen movies right you know the uh poseidon adventure story story story story towering inferno  you had to meet everyone first right and all the all the characters and then the second half of the  movie was all those characters that you now know about right in this uh you know situation that's 
[00:28:00]  why avengers did so well because it was just one long action sequence from the middle to the very  end of the movie but the movie's long it's well over two hours right yeah so was avengers thor and  but i'm just saying like so they could easily cut 15 15 to 20 minutes out of the first half i'm  thinking then you get all those assholes that say oh the story wasn't accurate or you didn't explain  something right but this way they take care of i guess of the geek culture and then anybody who just  wants to go see spider-man will get all the action and everything one asshole and i think he works 
[00:28:30]  here uh he looks sort of familiar one asshole he was sitting next to me and he goes well what's  frustrating to me is they never they never explain how gee i wonder who this is it's the voice they  never explain how these superheroes get so damn good at making their own costumes and i look down like  oh god go away is that gonna keep you up at night i don't understand like you know spider-man that 
[00:29:00]  costume was great but they don't explain how he just gets so good at making it right though older  or younger guy he was sitting right between me and roland i've seen him before oh younger guy i  don't know who he is oh i know he is oh damn i don't know bring him on the after show he's so  terrified of you oh really me no it's funny that you don't know who he is because i've introduced  him before and he found it to be very awkward i don't know who it is i do i'm polite i say nice 
[00:29:30]  to people but it doesn't sink in wow i have no idea who it is martin sheen it was great martin sheen  playing that blue collar guy with not much education you know peter grew up on the streets you know the  uncle's raising the kid because obviously everyone knows the storyline the parents that disappear there  and uh martin sheen has this uh moment he's like you know you know peter i i don't have much of an  education as you know i stopped helping you with your homework when you're 10 years old 
[00:30:00]  but then still is able to give him some kind of life lesson even though even though he's just that  uneducated blue collar guy he's not book smart but he's street smart raised in the trenches but he's  great and everything does martin sheen yeah he really is seen in the movie he's very passive um  but when he gets upset at peter parker you think your dad's yelling at you yeah he's just sitting  there and he stares at you and then he blows up and you're like holy shit and sally fields besides uh 
[00:30:30]  her her horrendous neck man that that woman is held up yeah and it looks like she didn't go with a lot  of that plastic surgery like the rest of hollywood she's she's pretty boniva during the uh movie i don't  know pop that fucking old graham cracker bone medicine wasn't lifting anything as now as an  older woman she's she's beautiful but that neck is a has a world of hurt peanut brittle that's funny  boniva she do she was she's an oscar winner she's fucking grew up on television and stuff and all i 
[00:31:00]  think of now yeah is that boniva commercial jamie lee curtis what do you think of that shit yogurt  all she does is have bad shits activia i don't know why they do that they got enough money  why why do they do that poise fucking piss pads yeah now that's uh just wait it out sally fields  or is it field field yeah sally field all she had to do was wait it out to get the big movie again  get the parts you don't have to do that shit take those goddamn fucking right pretzel stick bone 
[00:31:30]  medicine iraq did you have a problem when uh peter parker woke up and he realized he had this  incredible strength and so he was pulling everything off the wall and then all of a sudden he  is writing with a pencil does that shit bother you or not they they i hate shit over exaggerated  that he doesn't know what he what's going on he woke up with this new strength i'm not giving  anything away it's part of the story so like he's trying to brush his teeth and he's pulling the  faucets off and stuff like that but next thing you know within a minute or two he's figuring out some 
[00:32:00]  kind of formula and he's writing with a pencil it's like yeah that would are you supposed to  let that shit go or does that bother you i think he's supposed to assume that he probably figured  it out within minutes he couldn't even figure out how to open the door to get out of the bathroom  i yeah i chalk that up to the same thing as trying to figure out how he got so good at making those  suits his costumes oh boy he said the wrong thing to me i rolled my eyes like really who is it write 
[00:32:30]  it down i gotta know this i don't even know if i barely know you're not gonna know i know how is  he gonna know mark zito who's mark zito you mean at mark zito who's mark zito i don't even know i've  heard the name who is he oh it's funny who is he uh he did some work for the round of feds show i  just don't know these guys yeah um i still don't know the name of the morning mashup guy even though  now we joke about how i don't know his name mark zito is a guy like he thinks like he's you know 
[00:33:00]  hanging out with the host because he wants to be a nice guy but in his heart he's just like a little  management guy like he's just like a little junior executive middle management that's all yeah  and the other thing which is why opie making fun of him for trying to hang out and have like a joke  with the guys like he's exactly like that's exactly what is what he would have said opie would have  said about somebody in management god it's great the other thing is this eric when uh peter parker 
[00:33:30]  becomes the spider-man guy and he comes home and he's all bruised up right right yeah you're  listening and they got to tend to his wounds whether it's his uh little love interest or a  sally field there so they they show you like he's still kind of human and you know he's taking bumps  and it hurts right uh-huh and then fast forward a mere 10-15 minutes he's falling off 10-story  buildings with monsters and be crashing to the ground yeah and being thrown through walls it's like oh 
[00:34:00]  okay he's doing finger push-ups upside down off the edge of buildings right oh shit but but they're  not saying that he's getting stronger where it can now take better bumps uh-huh he's yeah why is it  okay all of a sudden learning montage of how he's learning how to do everything and get stronger they  just go no but he still comes home all bruised up but now the bruise instead of a couple punches or  whatever now it's because he fell off buildings with monsters and got thrown through a million walls  maybe that spider shit uh kind of you know took a little while really no but he's still bruised and 
[00:34:30]  achy and like uh make me some eggs maybe they skipped a montage because they couldn't afford the rights  to take it to the limit but does that shit bother you when the there's uh the continuity gets a little  weird yeah yeah i joe de rosa was to my right i'm telling you everybody was there wow as soon as the  movie ended he's like wow that was awesome and i go yeah but it wasn't really believable  i got a good laugh for that how did uh how did the web look was it good uh when he shot better than 
[00:35:00]  the last you know what and with the good question yeah that's what was different yeah from the toby  mcguire this web was impressive good web yeah because he's playing it almost like a guitar like  you could you could you could feel the strength of it yeah you understood the strength of it string  at some point no this was like you silly this was a translucent looked like crystal almost it was  cool as shit cool web and then and they did a uh a cum shot where the web comes right at you in 3d 
[00:35:30]  oh man have his dick right here i think that's what they were trying to they were basically saying  look man this is what this is coming out of his dick but we can't do this because we want kids to  watch our movie but he did a lot of shots with the web oh he did yeah dick shots a couple criminals  got dick shots he thought it was kind of cool to throw web at fucking guys dicks yeah yeah yeah  what's what travis would do if he was spider-man oh because he's dr gay yeah yeah of course so in 
[00:36:00]  general i like the movie that sounds good leary was good the action was good it's good the 3d was  good shh good give you a spoiler if you want oh people don't like spoilers people don't like  spoilers give me a spoiler is it is it a silly spoiler yeah all right it's a silly spoiler people  can handle that surprise stan lee is in the movie oh come on now you wrecked it stan lee's cameo i'll  just say this he thinks he's hitchcock was really funny was it it was right usually it's intrusive and 
[00:36:30]  for that minute you're like oh great thanks for taking me out of the movie it was completely  intrusive oh and it's like when stephen king shows up are they yeah it was completely intrusive  like hey uh just want to remind everyone here's the guy that started all this did they do that on  purpose are they goofing on the fact that he's been in every movie so they i think they threw it in as  a like ironic kind of joke i think they were just kind of having a little fun with it they're not 
[00:37:00]  taking them themselves too seriously all right like other uh these type of movies do ah they're goofing  on it because everyone expects him to be in a marvel movie yes it made me laugh but they did it in a  different way it made me laugh it was where you're i don't want to tell what you did but they did it  in a different way that you sit there and it was actually funny to see it going on okay yeah so  something i didn't mind at all when i see it doesn't it open uh tonight or something uh no it's on  tuesday night oh really ted opens tonight and uh no tonight this weekend is all about magic mike 
[00:37:30]  what is magic mike god what is magic mike magic mike could be the gayest but if a guy goes to magic  mike he's gay it has your favorite actor in it oh yes matthew mcconaughey who he's been on the show  he's he's not a bad guy no and we sat on the couch with him at uh the the jay leno show yes we drank  margaritas that were absolutely drank gas powered blender and then i took a picture with him backstage  and and realized his head could be even bigger than robert plants oh physically headed guy holy 
[00:38:00]  fuck he's got a massive melon oh what's that about i don't know but uh what is he all buff in this too  oh yeah he's taking his shirt off more than that oh shit what is this movie about i don't even know  magic mike is the description here mike a male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party  pick up women and make easy money what this one is a movie that only girls should go see uh and gays  and and gay this will probably get a big gay following this will be a huge gay movie i've heard it's actually 
[00:38:30]  good what that's right 81 on rotten tomatoes and what if if fez was talking i would ask him if he was  going to oh shit why would you do that what happened why are you saying that i'm trying to  motivate no he doesn't like that i think ronnie needs a little push a little help so i'm trying  to motivate him he made a joke yesterday he did i was driving home i heard it i wasn't yeah it was  something about he did he said um he said oh he was talking about the uh the guy in florida that ate

Wow  Is that a typo?  I had the first incarnation  You sure did, Ann  And every one since 
[00:53:30]  And I refused to do the iPhone  Oh, it's  For the people keeping track at home  It's the best thing ever  Don't shake your head  The Samsung fucking rules, man  It's got your name in it  Why don't you like it?  Well, because it's  That would be like me getting an Anthony Sung phone  Right  I would get that in a second  AntSung?  AntSung  Yeah, why wouldn't you have a Samsung, Sam?  Because it's not as good as the iPhone, I guess  It's really just as good  Sorry  But it is true  The iPhone is like  It's everybody  It's I  It's me  The iPhone  The first person  It's better than the Samsung  Yeah, it is  It's certainly better  There's not a better phone than the iPhone 
[00:54:00]  Well, you keep buying the myth  It's not a myth  I've never had a problem  No, you're buying the myth  My iPhone's great  It's fantastic  Your screens are much smaller than my fucking Samsung  It's a phone  If it's in my pocket  Yeah  So mine does too  Probably makes it uncomfortable  That has to hit one of your balls when it's in your pocket  That corner  That bottom fucking corner  Has to tap on the nut  When you're walking  And what's wrong with that?  Well, that's true  A little pleasure  A little thrill as you're walking  When you're not checking your Twitter  A little pleasure  It's called a feature  Yeah 
[00:54:30]  A special app  Touch my balls  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  What else?  Well, we did have a  Oh, we gotta do the Ann Curry first  Oh, Ann Curry  Yes  Because we set it up  She got her ass thrown off of that Today Show, huh?  Because Matt Lauer said, beat it  Beat it, stupid  I never liked Ann Curry if anyone gives a fuck  You know, Ann Curry is one of the very few people that my mom has a hatred for for some odd reason  Wow, your mom loves everyone  I know why  Why?  Because it's a phony niceness 
[00:55:00]  Maybe  And it's a very  She's very sweet and monotone  And there's no up and downs with her personality or emotions  And I think that drives people nuts after a while  It's just a phoniness  Everything is just like  Al, what do you got on the weather today?  Everything was just in this delivery  Very just  Everything is good with the world  I never even watched  Unless we were in here, you know  I mean, she's been around long enough that you pick up on something with her, right? 
[00:55:30]  Everything is like  Al, Matt  And what was the reason they gave?  GMA, out of nowhere, started beating the Today Show  Oh man, they got to shake shit up then  And they got to shake shit up  And they said, Ann Curry, you got to go  You're the problem  That's great  So I guess in their official release  It was amicable  She wanted to move on to do different things  All that blah  And yeah, they always say that  And it's always bullshit  There were many reports of her  And Matt having very bad chemistry  Her transition to host from News Anchor was not smooth 
[00:56:00]  Really?  Oh  Or from News Anchor to host  News Anchor to host, yeah  I got what you meant  I didn't care  Thank God  Wow  What does someone have to do around here to get a spoon?  Yeah  Suck that dick  Oh, here's my  Here's my spewn  A spewn  A Reese Witherspewn  Spewn  For spewns  So here's Ann Curry saying goodbye, I guess  The goodbye speeches are always fun to listen to 
[00:56:30]  Oh yeah  Even if you're not a fan of the Today Show  It's always fun  Gotta love a good goodbye speech  To see someone saying, see you later  Zank a ticket  And especially when they're being forced to fuck out  Yep  This is her dream  She worked at the Today Show for like 12 or 15 years or something as a reporter  As just a newswoman  Newswoman  Bringing her up  It's the American story right there  And then she got passed over for Meredith Vieira  Right  I was passed over  And then Meredith goes  And she gets the big seat  And after a few months  A few months  They're like  Fuck out of here, Curry 
[00:57:00]  Yeah  A few months  She was there more than a few months  Take a hike  As a host?  She wasn't there long  I think she did a year  Maybe a year  Maybe a year  That's not long at all  Man, that's an epic failure  Oh yeah  In television hosting  Duties  The Ant Song  Duties  The Ant Song  Duties  Would you buy the Ant Song?

[00:57:30]  June 9th  So they gave her a year  They go, you know what  Let's try this for a year  But they signed her for three  That's why they're out  Fuck, so she walks away  I heard they're going to pay her at least 10 million  I heard that as well, Sam  Yeah  She not only walks away with 10 million  Then she gets paid for her new gig, by the way  It's not like, here's 10 million  But we want you to do something else  Here's 10 million to leave the fucking slot  Yeah  Get off the fucking couch  So when you hear her getting emotional  Just go blah, blah, blah  Yeah  So welcome back, everybody

[00:58:30]  Let's start over  So welcome back, everybody  It's 8.50  And this is not easy to say  But today is going to be my last morning  As a regular co-host of today  I will still be a part of the Delisha family  Oh  Oh, no  I came out of Dayton, Ohio  With two bad knees  I'm 18 years ago  I left Dayton, Ohio  With two very bad knees  Oh, you're right  And what else?  What else? 
[00:59:00]  In a dream to become a Major League Baseball player  I hope that happened for him  Did it?  I think God's dream came true  It did come true  Good for him  Oh, this crap  How did they tape this?  Was it a pre-tape piece?  Or did she do this live?  This was live  What's she bringing out?  Can we just play the video?  Or did you chop up this whole thing?  I'd rather see the video  I would rather see her sad face 
[00:59:30]  As you know that she's getting  Ten million dollars to walk away  You should see the fucking place  She's remodeling on the Upper West Side  Don't feel sorry for this one  Well, she's got the cash  But she doesn't have the prestige  Yeah  Oh  Great, Dan, Tom  Alright, here we go  Now we get to see the video  There's going to be an ad, I'll bet  No, there won't be an ad this time  Prepare yourself  Nope  See?  Alright  Oh, boy, here it is  We got volume?  Yeah  I'm all set over here  I will still be a part of the Today Show family  Oh, come on  Oh, Sam 
[01:00:00]  You didn't have the volume up on the browser  Dan, this is not easy to say  But today is going to be my last morning  As a regular co-host of today  I will still be a part of the Today Show family  But I'm going to have a new title and a new role  And this is not as I expected to ever leave this couch after 15 years  But I am so grateful  Especially to all of you who watch  All of you  Because Matt and I and everyone who sits on this couch  Yeah  We often call ourselves a family  Oh, boy  But you 
[01:00:30]  Some family got thrown out of it  Are the real today Show  You are why I have ventured into dangerous places  And interviewed dictators  And jumped off of planes  Dictator  And off of bridges  And climbed mountains  And landed in the South Pole  Funny  And convinced the Dalai Lama to come line  Right  You're going to go through your whole career  You know, I have loved you  And I've wanted to give you the world  Thanks  And for all of you who saw me as a groundbreaker  She's digging holes  I'm sorry I couldn't carry the ball over the finish line  Why is she a groundbreaker?  Because she's 10% Asian or something? 
[01:01:00]  Is that it?  I don't know  What is she?  What is she?  Why is she a groundbreaker, Sam?  I don't know  She'd break ground  Maybe because she  Why is she a groundbreaker?  I guess going from the news anchor desk to being a host  That has happened a million times  It's never happened  It's never happened  She's a woman on TV  That has happened before  Has there ever been an Asian woman on TV?  Is she Asian?  What is she?  In the news?  I've never seen Asian women in the news  No, it doesn't happen  No  So why is she a groundbreaker?  Somebody  Maybe  Groundbreaker  Please  Let's see  Please  Is she a chud? 
[01:01:30]  Maybe she's the first person to last a year  Even though Matt Lauer was trying to put the boots to her the whole time  Yeah  Why is she a groundbreaker?  Someone at that Today Show door hit you on the ass  Someone that writes a media blog  Please call us and tell us why she's a groundbreaker  Yeah  It's all about the blog  Alright, play the rest of this horse shit  Nice  I'm sorry I couldn't carry the ball over the finish line  Balls  Man, I did try  And so to all of you who watched  Thank you  From the bottom of my heart 
[01:02:00]  For letting me touch yours  And thank you for your emails  And for your support  And I will keep trying  And I'm so sorry  I turned into a sob sister this morning  Please forgive me  Sob sister  But I hope you'll wish me well  Oh  Matt Lauer is just sitting there laughing  It's 8.50  Same shit  And this is not easy to say  But today is  Wait  Just watch that  Wait, what?  What happened there?  Is that different?  No, it's the same thing  You know what?  I saw something very subtle there  That speaks volumes  When Matt touched her shoulder  And she just went  Like a cobra? 
[01:02:30]  No  When he was tweeting the entire time  Oh  He was on his phone  Just fucking looking through his tweets  You don't give a fuck  Imagine they fucking pull out the camera  And he's just texting  L-O-L  She was crying  You done?  Why is she groundbreaking?  I don't know  Why?  And what did Al Roker have to say?  Apparently Al Roker and her friends  They gave each other  And they embraced  Of course  They embraced  Al Roker 
[01:03:00]  That militant black guy  Al Roker  Good old Al Roker  Stop Al  That joke  He's an idiot  Although we go back and forth on Twitter a little bit  Do you?  A little bit  Anything friendly?  I was polite to him recently  Yuck  After years of beating him up  For being a hypocrite  He said he didn't have any problems with you guys  When I talked to him  Oh good for him  I have a major problem with him  So  I need to tell him next time  He's a hippiest crit  I'm not a fan  But we don't know why she's groundbreaking 
[01:03:30]  I'm trying to figure it out  She got her ass booted from that couch  Yeah they picked her up  Like DJ Jazzy Jeff  On the Fresh Prince  When Uncle Phil  Just threw him at the door  That was Ann Curry  That's how they fucking treated her  She's lucky that she could  She was able to say goodbye  They didn't even want her on the couch yesterday  Exactly  They were like  Beat it stupid  Say your stupid goodbye  And just take the rest of the morning off  One minute in  We got the next dumb  Fucking bimbo 
[01:04:00]  Ready to go  They were giving her the wrap up  As she was going  That's right  She's like  I just want to thank everybody  And the red light is on  In her face  Like a comedy club  Right about the Dalai Lama  Wrap it up  Stop  Well apparently also  Al  Not Al Roker  Matt Lauer  Is going on vacation  So they wanted to get the new  His new co-host in there  As quickly as possible  Before he goes on vacation  What the hell is that  That was DJ Jazzy Jeff  Oh getting thrown at it  That's Ian Curry  That's the Today Show studio  Right there's the Today Show studio 
[01:04:30]  There goes Ian Curry  Wow they just threw her  Just thrown right at it  Nice  That's pretty fucking funny  So Matt Lauer's going on vacation  Yeah he's going on vacation  So they want to get that  Kind of initial  Them together thing  Before  Get everyone comfortable  With the new team  Yeah yeah  So she'll be able to  Take over the duties  When he goes on vacation  And they said they were  In a panic  To absolutely make sure  That before the Olympics  This all went down 
[01:05:00]  Oh please  Because we all know  Who's the new broad  Well I'm hearing  Maybe we should turn on  Channel 4 and find out  But I'm hearing  Oh maybe we should  Savannah Guthrie  What?  Who's that?  Is she a porn star?  Nope  That's Savannah you're thinking of  Oh shit  Didn't she sing  Alice's Restaurant?  No Savannah Guthrie  Is the girl who's been on  JD from New York City  Has a problem with her  Analogy  She said  It's not  Carry the ball 
[01:05:30]  Over the finish line  It's either  Carry the ball  Into the end zone  Or cross the finish line  Oh right  Yeah you don't  Carry the ball  Over the finish line  It would hinder  Your running  It's stupid  You don't run  With balls  It is stupid  I guess you can run  With a ball  But I mean  Yeah  She was talking about  Carrying them in her mouth  See  And she didn't want to  Yeah  It's either going to be  That chick that's been there  For a while  Who's Savannah Guthrie  Or some people are even saying  It could be  Hoda  Hoda  Hoda  So she can get away 
[01:06:00]  From that drunk  Cassie Lee Gifford  And what I've read  On websites  Well I assume she is  Because she drinks wine  On the show  She looks it  And somehow  They have wine Wednesday  Or something  I'm embarrassed  I know half this shit  Oh man  They say  And well you should be  They have wine Wednesday  And she has a nice  Big glass of red wine  As she broadcasts  They say if they go Hoda  They may bring Regis in  No that's just  Regis' people  Pushing his name forward  That ain't happening  No way  That ain't happening  For anything 
[01:06:30]  Roland was walking around  Rockefeller Center  I think two days ago  Yeah  Around all the tourists  Yelling out  Where's Hoda  Hoda  Hoda  Where's Hoda  Hoda  They're thinking about  Bringing me on board  If they use Hoda  No they're not  Regis  Well Regis filled in  For Hoda  Last week  See I know that  Him and Kathy Lee  First time in 12 years  Or something like that  Well Kathy  How are things  Is your husband  Still a whore fucker  Remember that whole episode  When he was recorded  Trying to have air sex 
[01:07:00]  In a hotel room  He's forgotten  How did you talk about that  Why did you  You ever address that one  Kathy Lee  Is that why you're  Drinking the wine  Remember the  Hidden camera  It was in the  It was in the  The hotel room  And the gif  Was asking to  Put it in a shitter  You do get the new Regis  Now that he doesn't  Have a gig  Oh yeah  He's another guy  That's in his  I don't give a fuck  Stage  He doesn't care  Nah you don't care  He's going on all these shows 
[01:07:30]  And just having a good time  Kathy Lee  How's your son Cody  Did he grow up a fag  With all the coddling  All the coddling  You gave him  All that overprotective  Mothering shit  Did he grow up  Sucking cock  Why is he yelling  He always yells  Now he's just  Yeah  He's definitely a yelling  Does gif  Have to use  Is gif using  The pasty vac  Kathy Lee 
[01:08:00]  Is he using  The pasty vac  When he tries  To put it in your  Dumper  He loves the dumper  Loves it  Gelman  Where's Gelman  You think Gelman  Has kept in touch  With Regis  After they showed  Regis the door  Oh fuck that  There's another fruit  Like your son Cody  I bet they suck  Each other's cocks  People know the real story  About Regis too right  He didn't want to retire  Nah he was forced out also  He was forced out as well  They threw him out the door  They were like  He got jazzy jeffed  He got jazzy jeffed 
[01:08:30]  He got jazzy jeffed  Out the door  With you reege  She was  Fuck a ball  Fuck a ball  Let God sort it out  You want to know  What's groundbreaking  About um  Aunt Carrie  Yeah  Matt V from Brooklyn  She was born in Guam  So she's the first person  From Guam  To do anything  Guam  Oh wow  To do anything  Is that it  Hey my brother  Lived in Guam  For a while  As a marine biologist  But he wasn't born there  He wouldn't hang out  In the rainforest  And he would cut down 
[01:09:00]  Banana trees  And dive and stuff  What's up with David Beckham  He's a sex symbol  Wait he was left off  The British Olympic team  That's breaking news  He sucks  They snubbed him  They threw him out too  They gave him the jazzy jeff  He got jazzy jeffed  He got jazzy jeffed too  He's too busy modeling underpants  To practice soccer  He really is  That is a handsome guy  He's very handsome  Jesus Christ  That's how he got posh 
[01:09:30]  Yeah I know  He got the posh  But the handsomeness  Got in his way  Yeah  He's too handsome  To be a soccer star  So why is that big news  That he was left off the team  I would assume  He's not that great  At soccer anymore  On that level anyway  He's an older guy  At this point  Older guy  Playing America  You're not that good  If you're playing  Soccer in America  Yeah  Well  And he's too old  And he's done  Was that an outrageous  Statement or what  That's outrageous  It is right  Yeah  Now you're just trying  To make trouble  Plus  Sorry David  If you're really good  At soccer 
[01:10:00]  You're playing  You're playing in Europe  Oh fuck  Why would you come over  To America  Where no one gives  A flying fuck  About soccer  Well here come  The arguments again  You know what though  Here it comes again  The proof is in the pudding  As I like to say  Soccer  Not really  That big  In the US  Doing the job Don  A lot of foreigners  Like to watch it  I know whenever I go  Into like a pizza place  Out on Long Island  They go into a pizza place  They're all fucking  Staring at the TV screen  And it's that  God damn horrific  Long shot of a soccer field 
[01:10:30]  They certainly  They've gotten better  But you still  You can't really  Televise soccer  And make it look like  They do football and shit  Where it's nice and close  You know how the NFL  Now has those cameras  On the cables  Oh they're great  Why don't they do that  For soccer  You're right  Because no one  Gives a shit about soccer  You're right  Why get paid for the expense  It just feels uncomfortable  To watch  Because I'm repeating  What you said  But it's worth repeating  It's just a long  Fucking shot  Giant long shot  With little fucking  Players around  And then when something  Happens  They do the close up  Right  But for the most part 
[01:11:00]  It's like  Yeah that would be  Kind of cool I think  You don't get that  Good fucking like  Right in there thing  Like they do with  Football now  Yeah  Football fucking broadcast  Now are  They're amazing  I don't understand  Why how the football  Doesn't hit the cameras  When they're on the cables  I know right  I get confused by that  How does that work  Yeah what the hell  You're right  I don't understand that  I don't need to know  So you don't have to  Call about that  Can we get back  To Ann Curry for a minute  Sure  I wonder if  The Today Show  Oh she just flew out  The door  Wait a minute  There she goes  I wonder if  The Today Show  Threw the couch away 
[01:11:30]  After she left  Oh man  Right  Leftover curry  On this  Kind of did a  Who's that  That's Savannah Guthrie  That's the new chick  She's the chick  Fucking beautiful  Yeah you like her  Travis what do you got  I certainly do  Hotter than Ronaldo  She's in  Hotter than Ronaldo  You think they did  Anthony Comey  And threw the couch away  Yeah  To get rid of  You have to  Get rid of the bad mojo  Get rid of the stink  I got rid of Booger  And they got rid of  The bad mojo  Right  What do you got  You guys are talking  About football  And I completely 
[01:12:00]  Forgot to put it  On the prep sheet  But did you  Football  American football  Yes American football  You heard what they're  Doing with the  Four o'clock games now  Yep  It's great  They're starting at  410  No  What happened  415  425  Why  It's on TBS  Because now  Maybe we'll be able  To see some of those  Games that get cut off  Those one o'clock games  You're not a football fan  So you don't understand  Oh no I got you  Alright  You invest  This has driven me  Nuts forever  And I know  There's workarounds now  I get it  But for most of my life 
[01:12:30]  You would invest in a game  And all of a sudden  It's the last five minutes  It's amazing  It's tied to  What the fuck  And they go  Well  Due to contract  Stipulations  We now join  The San Diego Chargers  It's like  What  Oh no  I'm watching this game  So they finally  Figured it out  After all these years  415 games are now  Starting at 425  Why would you put a  Fucking sporting event on  If you know  You're not going to  Show the end  Of that particular game  Well contracts  The end is pretty important 
[01:13:00]  Right  It justifies the means  Yeah  Oh very good  Doc  The game  It wasn't a gay thing  Doc  The game  So what  Wait  Football's going to be on TBS  No  Sam's just talking  I was making a joke  Because TBS  Used to start things on 05  They did  You went with an 05  Fucking joke  Nice  I throw him out there  Remember that old gag  I remember that  It was like TBS  What are they doing  Why is Gilligan's Island  Starting at  4.05  Because it's a TBS 
[01:13:30]  And Ted Turner  Had like a logic to it  He's like  Fuck this  Man people don't like  Tune in on my hour  It's like  Where the commercials are  And people start  Going around the channels  And my show  Will already be on  Yeah  That was his logic  Like top of the hour  They would  In between shows  There's a lot of commercials  But their show  Is still going on  And then when their show  Ends  The other people's shows  Already have started  So no one wants to  Invest time  So you go to  Stay on TBS  Well that's why 
[01:14:00]  They finally figured it out  Where like  A show ends now  And they just  You know  Put those credits  In the bottom left hand corner  And immediately start  The next show  So you don't have any chance  The other show starts  He plays the credits  On a show  Right after the last  Commercial break  So the credits  Are before the last  Show segment  Oh so that way  Because people see  Credits roll  And they think  It's over  Right  So now they see  The credits roll  Yeah  I got you  Well good for the NFL  For finally  Doing the right thing 
[01:14:30]  I didn't know that  Travis  420 finally  What if the game's  Going past 420  Which is kind of rare  Sucks to be you  But at least  They'll get most  Of the games in now  Yeah I mean  This mostly concerns  You know  Those games  That end in regulation  That just go a little long  Yeah  Which is cool  There was  Yeah there was a lot of them  There's a lot of games  You just never see the end of  It's so  That's infuriating  It was ridiculous  For us on Time Warner  That don't have  The red zone  Time Warner  I know  I love Time Warner 
[01:15:00]  Oh  They've been great to me  Over the years  By the way  I  They keep me on my toes  Cancel it  I could just cancel  Time Warner now  In my city apartment  I got that  Slingbox  Man is that the shit  Can I put a Slingbox  In my apartment  And just watch your TV  Uh sure  You could  Oh well  All I gotta do  Is give you the password  You don't even need Slingbox  There we go  And then you're just  Watching my cable TV  I watch Fios  In the city  Nice  Through my Slingbox  It's fucking great 
[01:15:30]  Slingbox  You made me think  Of Dick Slang  Oh  I've seen this video  You've heard the Dick Slang  Right  What is this  It's the wrong music  It's kind of a  It was a trend in the hood  For about a week  Where these guys  Would wear like just  Loose fitting underpants  Or sweats  And let their dicks swing  They call the Dick Slang  Because they're slinging  Around their dicks  You haven't  We should do this  At our next live event  You never saw a sequel  No  I  Oh  Come on 
[01:16:00]  You never saw this  No  They were trying to get this  As the new thing  And it didn't take off  But there are a few videos  Like this out there  What the fuck is wrong  With these assholes  That's the Slingbox  What was it called  In the hood  Dick Slang  Yeah  Dick Slang  Yeah it was pretty funny  And they all take turns  Showing all their dicks  It's a weapon  How gay is this  Not at all  That's fucking gay  It's called Dancing Ant  I don't think it is  Yeah it's very Magic Mike-ish 
[01:16:30]  What's he doing  Look at it  It's a big one  What?  Of course it is  Look at the  Look at the source  Yeah  Alright  It's the Dick Slang  Madicken  Yeah  They want to do some  Madicken  There you go  He's really working  His dick  Right  Yeah so that's it  I just want to  No that's good  That's good info  For today  I did not know that  Yeah  Alright 
[01:17:00]  I'm still trying to figure out  Why Ann Curry was groundbreaking  You know I googled  Ann Curry groundbreaking  And it's just  Nothing came up right  It's just news articles  That say  Groundbreaking  Reporter Ann Curry  And then just doesn't  So she probably  She labeled herself groundbreaking  She probably did the  Howard Stern  And gave herself  Her own title  Her own title  There's no  People that give  Their own title  I'm groundbreaking  I guess like her father  Was from Guam  And her mom's from Japan  Why does that make her groundbreaking  I don't know  What does that mean  At this point  E-Rock's groundbreaking 
[01:17:30]  At this point  Well you're  That's a fat joke  Yeah  Oh literally  At this point  Sidewalk crack  I was just gonna say  At this point  Like  That being first  Is something  We've done it  Stop  What else are you gonna do  Look how happy  Matt Lauer is  Interviewing this chick  Like  Ah you should see  What I did to Ann Curry  Yesterday  Oh man  That's what he's talking to her about  Yeah  Oh I would love to  See that bitch around here  No more  You think there were  Lots of jokes this morning  When everybody walked in  And she was

[01:18:30]  Did it to me again  We don't have that part  Of our brains  What part  To just be professional  And take the high road  No  You know Ann Curry  Hates fucking Matt Lauer  Matt Lauer hates Ann Curry  They all hate each other  Yeah  But they have to  Make it sound like  It's all good  And everyone's  Okay with it  Yeah but they will  Fuck each other  Behind the scenes  Oh you think  They're motherfucking  Each other  They're jazzy jeffing  Each other  Behind the scenes  And Matt Lauer's  Got all the power  Groundbreaking is where  Her ass hit the ground  When she was thrown

[01:26:00]  We drive right by  It's  Yeah  You can't drive by  The Today Show  When they have these artists  But we have Fox  Right across the street  And they set up a stage too  And man that road's  Never closed  It's never closed for anyone  Depending on the artists  You can't walk by  The Today Show  You can't even get  Within blocks  Right  When they had Gaga on  It was like  Wall to wall everything  Not even the street  The sidewalk isn't even full  Over there at Fox  No yeah  Every Friday I drive  As they're set up the stage  And I roll my window down  Hey who's playing today 
[01:26:30]  And then they try to answer me  What they get is a window  Over their face  I don't give a fuck  Who gives a shite  I don't give a fuck  Hey so I'm  I was at this meditation class  Last night  And I'm  Meditation  I won't bore you  With the ins and outs  But I do  There was something  That was said  That was very  Very  Interesting to me  The lady  Teaching the course  She's  Very well known  In the yoga community  There's a yoga community  Oh yeah  And she's an older  An older broad  She's got to be 
[01:27:00]  At least 70  Oh wow  And she's put together  Very very nicely  So there's got to be  Something with the yoga  70  Got to be something  With the yoga  And the meditation  Because she's  She's still  She's still  Doing it  Wow  And she's at least 70  I don't even know  But she said  That  Talked about knowledge  And vastness  And what's not  Yeah  And you know  You think your mind  Has limitations  And all that  And I'm not going to  Bore people  With the  Spirituality shit  But what she said  Which  Which was 
[01:27:30]  Was great  She said  When she was  Growing up  There was only  One  Known galaxy  Which is true  Right  Even we know that  Right  There was one galaxy  When we were growing up  One galaxy  Well  No I don't think so  Wait a minute  She is older than us  How many galaxies  Were there  When we were growing up  Galaxies  Well galaxies  Are fucking infinite  They really don't even know  But that's my point  Yeah  You jumped ahead  When we were growing up  They didn't say it was infinite  That's my  My complete point 
[01:28:00]  Hmm  She said  When she was growing up  And learning in school  That they said  There was one known  Galaxy  Really  Okay  And now  She says  You know  Now in the year 2012  They're estimating  There's at least  400 billion  Yeah  So why the fuck  Here's my point  Why do  Why do we attempt  To learn anything in school  Because it's all wrong  In the end  It's all  How many planets  Did we have  When we were growing up  Nine  There's a lot more  Than nine now  Not in our solar system  There's actually 
[01:28:30]  Less  What is there  They took Pluto  And threw that out  Why  Jazzy Jeff Pluto  Planetoid  Look if it's a marble  In the sky  It's a planet  Yeah  Don't fuck with me  Don't fuck with me  With the moon shit  I don't like the idea  That they  That they  Threw out  Pluto  I kind of  Always liked that  Is that because  That's a moon  Or something  Eight planets  No it's a planetoid  It doesn't quite  Fit the bill  Of a planet  Oh really  The orbit is different  Than what  Constitutes a planet  How about you  Redefine what a planet  Is then  They're all planets  What are they 
[01:29:00]  Talking about  They don't  Consider a  Pluto a planet  Anymore  There's only two  Masses in space  You got the asteroid  Alright well  Give  No the sun  Isn't  Well weren't the  Planets the suns  So they're the same  Thing too  No the sun  Is the sun  No but other  Other things  Were suns  And then they  Burned out  Well yeah  You would get  A black hole  Or a  A pulsar 
[01:29:30]  Right  Or even  A post  Nova star  Can make a nebula  But my point  Is this  We didn't  Learn about black  Holes when we  Were growing up  They didn't have  Black holes yet  No they really  Weren't throwing  That around  We only had a  Couple of  Just a few  We'll call it  Planets  And we had  Maybe one or  Two galaxies  And now all  That is just  Wrong  So it was  A wasted  Time  A complete  Wasted time  When we were  Struggling through  School trying to  Get the A's  On our exams 
[01:30:00]  Yeah  I would love  To get an old  Exam from when  We were in  High school  To see how  Much shit is  Wrong  Especially in  The science  Community  They had a  Lot of shit  Wrong  Obviously  Yeah  Math hasn't  Really  Well I guess  It has  Developed  But in  General the  Math we  All learned  In school  The older  Guys out  There  And the  Older  Women  Numbers  And  Numbers  Numbers  And  Numbers  There you  Go  But science  Is completely  Different  Astronomy  Is completely  Different  It's what  You learn  And what  Is discovered 
[01:30:30]  I mean  I think  The things  That have  Changed the  Most  As far  As our  Solar  System  Goes  From the  Time we  Were in  School  Till now  Is  They  Were able  To pick  Out  A couple  More  Moons  I  Believe  Yeah  Yeah  Because  They didn't  Have quite  A grasp  On all  The moons  Of all  The planets  Other  Things like  Axis  Of certain  Planets  That they  Spin on  Right  They figured  That shit  Out  But for  The most  Part  I'm  Pretty sure  Though  They knew  There was  Going to 
[01:31:00]  Be some  Galaxies  You know  They knew  There were  A lot  Of galaxies  I don't  Know what  She was  Talking  About  I think  They thought  It was  Just one  Big galaxy  Out there  Instead of  Separate  Galaxies  To the  Tune of  At least  400 billion  At this  Point  Well when  You look  What do  They say  There's  More  What  Than  Grains  Of sand  I forget  That one  Planets  Galaxies  Galaxies  Are what  Make up  They're  A bunch  Of  Your star  Systems  Make up  The galaxy  Right 
[01:31:30]  And then  Your star  Systems  Make up  Solar  Systems  With planets  Orbiting  Around  Them  And then  Your various  Gases  And what  Not  But for  The most  Part  Your galaxies  Are groups  Of stars  Ours is the  Milky Way  It's that little  S-shaped  Kind of  Swirly  Thing  They're the  Swirly  Things  The universe  Contains all  The galaxies  And all that  Empty space  How many  Universes  Are there  Well that's  Up for  Debate  The normal  Answer is  One 
[01:32:00]  The giant  Vast  Void  That we  Reside  In  And everything  Else  In  The universe  Lives in  But then  There's alternate  Universes  And things like  That  Multiverse  Multiverse  Does the vastness  Creep you out  When you're trying  To go to bed  At night  Not when I'm  Trying to go to bed  At night  But there are  Occasions where  You start thinking  About it  And real quick  You go  Ah  I can't wrap  My mind around it  Shit  I thought I had it  For a second  No  Especially when I was  Younger  That was a horror  Movie in my head 
[01:32:30]  When you try to  Wrap your little  Dumb brain around it  Oh that's crazy  It's like wait  Wait  Is there  Is there an end  To the universe  Yeah  And then if there's  An end  What's past that  Because it can't  Just be an end  There has to be  Something on the  Other side of  The wall  Of the universe  There are certain  Galaxies that have  Gone through each  Other  They collide  What  In some way  But there's so  Much empty space 
[01:33:00]  They're so huge  That they just  Pass right through  Each other  Without any  Collisions or  Anything  It's amazing  How  That's another  Thing  You can't  Think of  Size  Like that  Type of  Size  You can't wrap  Your mind  Around it  Right  For a galaxy  Our own galaxy  Milky Way galaxy  From one side  To the next  You can't imagine  That size  You can't imagine  How big the sun is  Never mind like  A bunch of suns  Making up  A galaxy 
[01:33:30]  Crazy  Well the point being  Though when she was  Growing up  It's a lot different  Than what we know now  I'm sure a lot of her  Science was wrong  Yeah  I mean she's at least  70 so we're talking  50 years ago  Minimum  Yeah  What things have  Changed  Is that the 50s  Hey you hear  We only have  Nine planets  Hey Cunningham 
[01:34:00]  Hey  You hear  The earth is flat  Yeah I knew that  Why don't we get  Some broads  And rape them  It's legal right  Sure it is  It's the 50s  Hey  What is that  A negro  Get out of here  Get the hell  Out of here  Yeah it goes  There are more stars  Than there are grains  Of sand 
[01:34:30]  There you go  Okay  No there ain't  Yeah there is  Fonzie  Ma bang  Why did  We did that break  What  You know  Fonzie's office  Was the bathroom  That was a little strange  I just watched  A happy days  Two days ago  On one of those channels  Any guy  Asking you to go  In the bathroom  You know  He's looking for something  Yeah yeah  It was so bad  What was that about  I know 
[01:35:00]  Come to the bathroom  Cunningham  In my office  My office  I watched happy days  The other day  It was  Alright  Is it dated  It's unwatchable  Unless you're watching it  To get mad  Why  Because it's just so bad  And to think that was  The number one show  In the country  It was massively huge  It's horrible  So here was the premise  Arnold's  And it was  You know  What's his name  With the nose there 
[01:35:30]  Al  Al  Al  Al Dovecchio  Al wanted to get into the  Get his place  Into the  World record book  They didn't say  Guinness Book of World Records  It was like some other  Fucking mulligans  Fucking book of records  Or something  Right  So they wanted to set a record  In  In  The  The place  In Al's place there  So  Everybody's like  Richie had a girl  On his shoulders 
[01:36:00]  And was trying to do that  For like hours  And  And then  Fonzie's cousin  Came  And he was gonna  Set a record  He was like  Clumsy guy  Of  How many quarters  You could put on your  Elbow  And then catch him  I used to do that move  Of course  You ever try that move  Yeah  Yeah  Take one  But the record was something like  40 I think  Okay  Or 38  And he was gonna do 40  But he couldn't do it  Like he was like  I can't do this Fonzie  And I'm watching this  And I'm thinking  This guy  Is such a bad actor 
[01:36:30]  It  It was horrible  Can we find the scene  On YouTube  How bad an actor  This guy was  During the entire show  Right  And then I realized  Why  They didn't get an actor  They got a guy  That could catch the quarters  Off his arm  And then  Throw him in there  To fucking  Play the guy  And didn't give a fuck  That he couldn't act  Yeah  Cause at the end  He actually had to  Take 40 quarters  And do it  And catch them all  In his hands  So in order  To do that  They had to get a guy  That wasn't a actor  So they had to sacrifice  The acting part  Yes it was terrible  By the way 
[01:37:00]  I do know  The sun is a star  The sun is a star  So Fonzie though  In this was  It was  Unwatchable  Really  I gotta see the scene now  He's doing all kinds of his  Say here it is  The book of records  Part 3  I think it was  Yeah  Magnolia book of records  Magilla  Oh Magilla  Gorilla  For sale  For sale  Oh there he is  Here he is now  He's  He's trying to catch  Oh God  Shut up  Wait a minute 
[01:37:30]  What do you mean  You can't do it  At least you're  Keeping up the coins  On the elbow  Now  That's half a trick  Ain't it  Oh God  But once again  He's in the bathroom  Yeah yeah  Another dude  My office  My office  My office  Yeah it was  It was unwatchable  I don't know  How that show was  Everyone had to watch it  Every week  Hey Happy Days is on  We only had three channels  That's true  I think a lot of these shows 
[01:38:00]  Were so huge  Because we had no other choices  There weren't any other choices  Yes Mr. Iraq  With Happy Days  You could always tell  Where they were  In the run of the show  Based on  Fonzie and his motorcycle  Like in the early days  You'd see him riding it  Yeah  A little bit later  He's always just  Kind of straddling it  But kind of walking it in  Oh yeah yeah  And then all of a sudden  They just got rid of the bike  No more motorcycle  No Fonzie on the motorcycle  Well Henry Winkler  Talked about how he  Just couldn't ride a motorcycle  Right  He was not very good at it  I also  There's that channel  That M.E. 
[01:38:30]  Me I guess it's called  And they play all these  Old shows  And when I get home  Right before I take my nap  I turn it on  Because Canon is on  Oh God  Canon  A Quinn Martin production  That show also  Is just so bad  Yeah who would ever  Listen to Canon  I don't know  That out of shape guy  He was  They did a racial one  The other day  I just found it hilarious  Canon  In what way  What was the racial angle  Well the racial angle 
[01:39:00]  Was a white guy  Was going out  With this black chick  And he wanted to marry her  But I guess the white father  Of the white guy  Didn't want him marrying  This black chick  And she winds up  Getting killed  Canon  So it could have been  The father of the guy  That did it  Yeah that's what  He had to figure out  But now the brother  And friends  Of the black chick  Like Canon  Goes to talk to them  And of course  He finds him  On a basketball court  And they're like  What do you want  Fat man  And they're all like 
[01:39:30]  That's jive  Turkey  Do they have the combs  In their hair  They had big afro  Let's find this  It was just so embarrassing  And black  And crazy  Yeah yeah  And Canon  You know  I always talk about  How fat Canon was  He was fatter  Than I ever remembered  Like where you  His stomach went out  So far  He was so fat  And then his  His phone in his car  I always loved that one  The little curly Q cord  And he used to have to call  Mobile operator  Mobile operator 
[01:40:00]  Get me 555  Canon  Yeah  It's good  Shows up in the polka dots  On the screen  Canon  Canon  That was production  Starring William Conrad  With guest stars  Michael Tolan  Marge Doucet 
[01:40:30]  James Luisi  Severn Darden  Severn Darden  Who  Tonight's episode  Bad cats  And sudden death  Is this the one you saw  I don't know  I don't know that it is  Bad cats  What  I just thought it would be fun  To throw on some canon  Those guest stars  Are horrible  Are you kidding me  Act one  Epilogue  Are you kidding me  Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta  But sometimes  Even if you don't know their names 
[01:41:00]  You watch these shows  And all of these shows  Mannix  And Barnaby Jones  All these detective shows  At this time  They all had the same guest stars  It was like  I know that guy  I don't know his name  But I know that guy  They just kind of made the circuit  They all made the rounds  They were like fucking  They were like  Ten guys  That were the bad guy  The father  The friend  The family member  Whatever it was  That were always guest stars  On these shows  They loved character actors  Back then  Yes  And they loved sticking  With the same ones  It was great 
[01:41:30]  Someone  McMillan and wife  Jen in Erie, Pennsylvania  Writes  Holy shit  You could be my grandfather  With this shit  Yeah  Can we be grandfathers  I probably could  Yeah  Sure  Could be  Can I be a grandfather  Yeah for sure  Shut the fuck up Sam  Let's see  If I had a kid  I don't think there's many  Grandfathers that were  Children of the 80s  So you relax right the fuck there  I'll agree with that statement  Can I be a grandfather  If I had a kid when I was 20  Let's say  Yeah  What age did I  31  Of course I could  What age did I have a kid 
[01:42:00]  Say you had a kid  Even if you had a kid at 22  I had 22  Yeah  Oh yeah  You could be a grandfather  Definitely  Ugh  Easily  Someone goes  Don't start doing the math  Anthony  It gets creepy  You guys could be grandfathers  Without there being controversy  Right  It wouldn't even be like  Wow that's a young girl  An old young  For a granddad  I mean it might have been a struggle  But it's certainly  Not unacceptable  What are you going to do  Easily  Come on now  Hey  I'm sorry my knowledge 
[01:42:30]  On the universe  Wasn't that great  But that shit always scared me  What happened  I don't really like  Learning about that  It's creepy  It's scary  It is right  I was getting  I don't think about it  Before I go to bed  But that exact feeling  Of losing sleep  And just getting terrified  About it  Was happening to me  While you guys  Were talking about it  Right  Oh  The guy's just thinking  About the planet  Well we all know  We're going to die  But then you go  Alright  I'm going to die  But people will be around  After me  That kind of know who I am  Wow  Oh wait  And then those people will die  And then  There'll be other people 
[01:43:00]  That sort of know  Who I was  Yeah it's a fade away  And then fast forward  Another generation after that  And this whole thing was useless  I never forget when I was like  Eight years old probably  What?  I never forget  I was eight years old  And I was on a plane  Yeah  And I looked down  And I was like  Look at all those cars  And they each have like  Four people in them  Yeah  There's like all these people  Wow that's so cool  And then I thought to myself  I don't know who any of them are  And they'll never mean anything to me 
[01:43:30]  Oh  And then I was like  But they don't know who I am  Anxiety attack  And then all of a sudden  Life is insignificant  Oh my god  I'm not special  That's why you gotta just  Have a good time I guess  Yeah  I don't know  It's creepy  I don't know if there's any real deep meaning  Have a good time all the time  Insignificance just gets thrown at you  That's my philosophy Marty  Right on  Spinal tap  And you gotta  You gotta believe at this point  There's a lot of fucking life out there  What do you mean?  In the galaxy?  There has to be 
[01:44:00]  In the universe  Because let's say you go with the traditional God thing  So God decides one planet  Out of billions and billions and billions and billions  Billions  Of planets out there  Yeah  He decides  Yeah you know what  Yeah I got this amazing thing in front of me  But I'm just gonna put life on one little thing  That's stupid  Yeah  But you don't know  Maybe this was just an anomaly  Alright yeah but do the math  See there's an actual scientific thing that says 
[01:44:30]  If there is one of something  It does not necessarily mean there's another  Gotcha  If there are two of something  It probably means there's more  Right  Whoa  Think about that for a while  So you know  Life on this one planet  Does not necessarily mean there's life elsewhere  If we ever did find life on another planet  It probably means that there's life  In a bunch of fucking places  I think there's life all over the fucking place  Yeah  I've always been at the theory  That there's life elsewhere  There has to be  But they've never visited us 
[01:45:00]  Because if they had  If they had the technology to visit us  Then what could we possibly have for them  They've already beaten us  Why would they  Why would they come visit us  And take us over  If they already have the technology to visit us  And why would they need this place  They don't need it  When there's billions and billions of other places they could pick  Right  They just look at us and laugh  Like look at those cavemen  There has to be  There has to be a shitload of life out there  I bet there is  There has to be  It's too vast for there not to be  Too vast and too many possibilities  You think there's another Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:45:30]  Oh that weird shit  Parallel Universe  That weird shit  Doppelgangers  Yeah you think there's string theory?  Well there's string cheese  I remember a movie  It was called Doppelganger  This movie  And there was another Earth  Exactly on the other side of the sun  What?  Exactly  So we never saw it  Oh how cool is that?  How do we know that's not happening?  It was a replica  How do we know that's not happening?  What?  Well we've sent other probes around  It's called Doppelganger  And then they finally figured it out 
[01:46:00]  And they sent a ship  But as they sent the ship  The other planet  Was running exactly the same way  It was the same people  Everything  But kind of a mirror image of it  Right  And so they sent another ship  And the guys got there and said  Must be a fucking problem  We  You know  We must have gone off course  Because this is the same fucking place  But then things were a little different  And the guys  With their families  And shit wasn't right  And they had to get back  And it was fucked up  It's called Doppelganger  Was it a good movie?  I don't know  I saw it years ago 
[01:46:30]  It probably sucks  Yeah but they didn't know  What a great concept  I thought Capricorn 1 was good  What a great concept  That was the one where they went to Mars  But they realized  Before they launched them  They realized that the ship  Would never make it to Mars  But they needed the funding  For the space program  If they told everyone  Hey the ship ain't gonna make it  Right  So what they did was  They launched the ship  With no one in it  And just let it go  And treated it like  They were actually going to Mars  And they put them on a set 
[01:47:00]  And let the three guys act  Like they were going to Mars  And then when they got back  They said that the ship  Had crashed on Earth  After the mission was done  And that everyone was dead  And they're martyrs  And we should  They would want the space program  To continue and everything  And then the three astronauts  Like holy fuck  They killed us off  They can't let us now go home  So the whole thing was them  Trying to get back  And escape from this place  The astronauts didn't realize 
[01:47:30]  They didn't realize  That they were now going to be killed  To keep quiet  Conspiracy  It was the guy from the  TD Waterhouse commercials now  Oh boy  It was him  O.J. Simpson  Right  And who was the third guy  I think it was  Mrs. or Mr. Barbra Streisand  Was it?  Sam Wolf  James Brolin  Sam Wolf  James Brolin  James Brolin  And O.J. Simpson  Were the three astronauts  People forget how beloved  O.J. Simpson was  He was the nicest black guy  On the planet 
[01:48:00]  At the time  On the sidelines  Harmless  Smiling  He was a black guy  That white people could  You know love  Yeah  Oh those daughters  Those fucking fathers  Or the daughters he would date  They didn't care he was black  He's O.J.  He's O.J.  Go O.J. go  Making people laugh  In all those silly naked gun movies  Go O.J. go  Yeah  Well  That space ship is scary  I like that one  Is it scary?  Yep  Oh here we go  Space be scary  There was a Spider-Man thing  On the Today Show  I want to see what they're saying  Spider-Man  Yeah  Yeah that space ship's scary 
[01:48:30]  Or is it?  I think it definitely is  Because you can get lost out there  And it's forever  I love how humans think they know stuff  We don't know shit  That's what I think  We know a very tiny tiny percentage of shit  And that goes right back to your point  I mean teeny tiny  Of what you learn in school  Because it's like  We don't know shit  It's all magic in space  None of it makes any sense  Right  You know this yoga thing yesterday  Again with the meditation  And they have like  Sanskrits from like 5 BC 
[01:49:00]  What?  What is that?  Going back to 8  Between 8 and 10 BC  So it's like  Predates Christianity  And Judaism  And all that  Right?  So it's another form of religion  Technically  Maybe a religion  That's a little more pure  Than some of the ones today  Maybe  Right  But then you're like  Oh wow  That's a long time ago  So maybe they're onto something  But then you think  You know  Then there's time before that  Yeah yeah  And then time before that  It's all nonsense  What do we really know?  Well  We know little 
[01:49:30]  Tiny little pieces of the puzzle  It's that whole recorded history thing  See the  Is that what fucks us up you think?  Yeah  Before really recorded history  It's kind of vague  And you don't know really  What came before that  Right  But then once people started  Chiseling some shit on walls  And then figuring out  You know  Like how to  Write shit down  A language  Right  And then preserve it  In books  And whatnot  Then it started becoming  Pretty good  As far as  Like being able to  Pass that along 
[01:50:00]  Do you think there was  A whole civilization  On earth  That just  Got completely  Wiped out?  Given the  Ability for  Archaeologists  And whatnot  To  To date things  And  They've done a pretty good  Timeline job on earth  Right  From  The time it was created  From the  Primordial  Woos and goo  And fucking  Star particles  To now  What if they  Would have dug  Just slightly deeper  And they would have 
[01:50:30]  Found something  A very old floppy disk  Would that  Change a lot of things  You think?

[01:56:00]  E-Rock what do you know?  Because the movie's great  No it's not  It's not bad  I've seen it  It's not that good  Steve Carell's not bad in that  Jason Segel's in it  Steve Carell is the Russian dude  We did this break too  I was amazed that that was him  It's not as good as Ice Age  It was better than Ice Age  Some of the Ice Age movies were good  All three of them  Awesome  And there's a new one coming out  Is there really?  Yep  So yeah I know this stuff  And I'm sorry  That's amazing  You should have seen Despicable Me  Should I have?  I think so  It's one of those animations  You probably should have saw 
[01:56:30]  I am  You don't have to see all of them  But that one maybe you should have seen  I am  You don't like animations?  I do  But that looked like it was a little too kid showy  I'm getting sick of them  Because now they're on constantly  Is that it?  Yeah  So I throw Family Guy on  Because it's cartoons  Oh it's  All they want is like cartoons  What?  For the kid  Yeah  All they want are cartoons though  That's fine  I watch he watches  Yeah  You get a little something out of it  So does he  Yeah  Yeah until he like  You know repeat something  Then I guess I'm fucked  And I have to like  Figure something out 
[01:57:00]  Yeah  So  Mmhmm  Meat sauce  Like semen or spaghetti  And meat sauce  Verification please  No we're doing pasta day  Today's pasta day  Is it pasta  Are they bringing pasta  We didn't really promote it  I thought we were just going to do  Shots of sauce or something  I thought we were doing  Deep dish pizza day  But for some reason  Hey why not  Falling through the cracks  Why aren't we getting any of that  There deep dish pizza  Pizza  Do you like pasta  When they fancy it up  Being an Italian guy  Oh I like some good pasta 
[01:57:30]  Yeah  Don't you like just a regular plain  I like a  One of the mill pasta  They fancy it up  With all that shit  Could be tomato sauce  Could be what you call  Your meat sauce  And that's it right  I love them both  What about peas  When they throw the peas  No get that shit  Out of my pasta  Are you a white sauce  Pasta guy  Uh  Sometimes  Sometimes  When I know I could  Have a red sauce  I can't have a white sauce  Period  Yeah  I do like 
[01:58:00]  Clams and red sauce  Or clams and white sauce  Well  Come on  Right answer is  Red sauce  Yeah  That a boy  That a boy  Yeah  I know  Oh my god  On cue  Look how much fucking food  They brought  Oh boy  Bring Roland here immediately  Leave the guys outside  Let them do their thing  Oh boy  I want to know what's going on  Oh boy  Dude my mouth just started watering 
[01:58:30]  Is it  I didn't eat dinner last night  Great  I'm starving  Between meditation and spider  Oh man  I'm busy  Roland  First of all  What did you think of Spider-Man  You were there too  I enjoyed it  I didn't fall asleep  Well you don't fall asleep as much  Since you lost a bit of weight  And you were exercising  Yeah I enjoyed it  It was really good  It was like an awesome 3D  The 3D was good right  And the spider  Was this webs  Oh when we all got splooged on  We got splooged on a couple times  We got splooged on 
[01:59:00]  Splooged on  We really did  Yeah  What happened  I don't know  They threw cum at us  Jesus  You got cum thrown at you  That's what they were basically  Trying to say  But they were trying to keep it  You know friendly for the kids  Yeah  But every adult in there  Was like holy fuck  Did you just sploog on me  What the fuck  It was cool though  When he was swinging around the city too  The shots  Splooged  The aerial shot  Because you just see his arms swinging  I think that was way better  Than the Tobey Maguire version of Spider-Man  Because Ant was asking earlier  Yeah when he's flying around the city  Now the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man 
[01:59:30]  That was pretty impressive  Yeah  But this made it just more vast  It was like a vastness  That's the thing  It was cool  And the Spider-Man jumps off of more high buildings  Yeah  He was a good Spider-Man  Yeah  Andrew Garfield  I like him better than Tobey  Why?  He plays more  Cuter?  Oh my god  LOL  Yes  LOL  Maybe an OMG  Maybe an OMG  An LOL  What the fuck are you talking about?  What is that about?  How did you LOL? 
[02:00:00]  I don't know  It just came out  Why do you like him better?  He plays a better Peter Parker  More nerdier  Than Tobey Maguire  Tobey Maguire was fucking nerdy as fuck  At the beginning  He was ripped and everything  Well they gave him a big cock too  This Spider-Man has a big cock  Got a big  Yeah they decided to show him  Massive bulge in the Spider-Man uniform  And Emma Stone is hot in the movie too  Who?  Emma Stone the blonde  Yeah but she seemed a little too old to play 17  But she's hot  Maybe that's a slight like problem  She's really hot 
[02:00:30]  Then Dennis Lurie was awesome  Yeah Lurie was great as the police chief  He was really good  Yeah but it was good though  Martin Sheen was good  Sally Field  Sally Field  Learned it's Field  Not Fields this morning  It was really good  My bad  LOL  You liked the special effects?  Yeah it was awesome  You liked the lizard?  Yeah he was good  He was good  He was good  The lizard was good  What other movie was he in?  Love Actually  That's  Oh  What?  Oh no  Not Ian Hill  Not Ian Hill  Nope  Recently 
[02:01:00]  Oh recently  Pyro Radio  Five year engagement baby  He was a professor  Yeah yeah  He was a professor in five year engagement  He's good in rom-coms  He's a rom-com guy  Yeah  Fucking rom-coms  He played Hugh Grant Best Friend in Notting Hill  Ugh  Notting Off  That fucking movie  Did you see it?  Everything with him in it  It's terrible  You actually saw that?  There were a couple of movies I had to see  What is that one about?  Back in the day  Where Julia Roberts is a big famous actress  She meets Hugh Grant in his town 
[02:01:30]  Notting Hill wife filming the movie  He  And they fall in love  Is the most boring  Every movie he's in  No  Is so incredibly boring  Hugh Grant?  He's charming  Yes  Except for Love Actually  It's not charming  What?  Love Actually was really good  What?  Love Actually  What?  Love Actually  What?  Have you ever seen About a Boy?  That's good  That's a great movie  Hugh Grant  About a Boy  Hugh Grant  Are you gonna see that Mikey movie or what was it called?  Magic Mike  Are you gonna see Magic Mike?  No  I was thinking perhaps we could  Go out to dinner this evening 
[02:02:00]  If you would be so inclined  Oh god  Do something  He's much more charming than that  Oh no  He's terrible  The problem with him is  He plays the exact same character  In every movie too  Every single movie  He's not a good actor  Every single movie  He's not a good actor  No  Like Mickey Blue Eyes  When he played the mafia guy  His best role was getting a blowjob  From that black chick  Holla  What was her name?  Divine Brown  Yeah motherfucker  Would you let Divine Brown suck your dick? 
[02:02:30]  Divine but no  Why?  She wasn't very divine that one  She was alright  She was brown but not very divine  Motherfucker  She was back  She was pretty good in those  Back in those days  One of them sisters yo  Those pillow lips  Change A Leno's  Ratings  When he had Hugh Grant on after that  Oh and he said  What were you thinking?  Actually that was good  Why am I making fun?  What's wrong?  She's alright there  Come on  Oh god  That looks like a man  Look at those big lips  It looks like a stop sign on her face  That's terrible  It's huge 
[02:03:00]  That's not bad  Huge  She got sloppy after that  But when she was first arrested  Not bad  Some nasty fucking hooker  He picks up  Jesus Christ  So we're gonna  Terrible  What's going on with Sauce Day?  They're here  And what do we get?  You get pasta  And then the little bread boats  With sauces  The sauce  It's phenomenal  Which sauce should I try?  It's their signature sauce  Sunday gravy  It's beyond amazing  Is it healthy?  Yeah  It has your protein  And tomatoes and stuff 
[02:03:30]  What?  It's your protein and tomatoes  What are you talking about  Protein and tomatoes?  I don't know  You get your tomato intake  For the day  The meat is the protein  And the tomatoes are your vegetables  So this is a perfect meal  Thank you  Yes  This is perfect  This is perfect  Sounds great  I'm ready  Alright  I heard a crazy theory  About space  That messed  Space  Messed his head up  Alright let's see  What Canada has to say  About space  My pants came down  At the DSA  I want to say hi 
[02:04:00]  To everyone  Moving to Canada today  Graham  A lot of people  Saying on the Twitter  They're moving to Canada today  So  Why?  Because of the healthcare thing  The Obama thing  Oh  Graham  What do you got buddy?  Well my stoner friend  Planted this idea in my head  Because space always  Mets with me  Talks about multiple universes  Infinite universes  For every possibility  He said  Every time you dream  You're watching yourself  In an alternate universe  Oh  How cool is that?  See that doesn't scare me 
[02:04:30]  That's cool  That one always  Just kind of  Messed with my brain  That's kind of cool  Why would that mess  With your brain?  I don't know  That isn't a fucking  Yeah  It's a viable theory  It means I'm nailing  All kinds of hot chicks  In other universes  Yeah exactly  Yeah really  Oh what  I can't run  In alternate universes  What happens  I'm trying to run  And I can't  You got cement legs  Oh when I have a gun  In an alternate universe  And I have to fucking  Use something  The bullets don't fit  In the gun  They fall out the barrel 
[02:05:00]  It doesn't work  The gun falls apart  In my hand  I've forgotten to go  To gym class  Every single day  For an entire school year  Right  Many times  In other universes  Yeah yeah yeah  But let's talk about  Dreaming for a second  Now  I like dreaming  Cause dreaming  Can make me  Ugh  Remember that song?  No  I like dreaming  Wow I don't know that one  You don't know that one?  Is that the doo-wop era?  It's terrible  No that was like  The 70s  You say era or era?  I say era  Or era  No I say era  Either way it's good though? 
[02:05:30]  I say era  Because it gets mixed up  With error  Error  Error  Error  I'm working on my vocabulary  It's doing very well so far  Thank you sir  Thank you  I got a long way to go  But I'm working on it  Um  That dreaming shit  There's gotta be something to it  But uh  I just think it's your mind  It's kinda sleeping  So things get a little fucked up  So  Nah  Your mind is your mind  That's why it's fucked up  You know what I mean?  No think about that  You just put me in a coma  For a second 
[02:06:00]  But think about it  I actually slipped into a  One second long coma  That's why it's fucked up though  Cause your mind is your mind  It's there  So why does it get all weird  When you sleep  Unless it's trying to do something else  Well it goes into sleep mode  Like you're not just  But why  Sleeping isn't just your physical body  Shutting down  Or slowing down  Your mind too  Goes into sleep mode  So  Why does it  Memories  And thoughts  And senses  That you normally have  When you're awake  Yeah  Are still there  But  You know  I don't know  I think it's some kind of porthole 
[02:06:30]  To something  Yeah  I don't know man  Cause why wouldn't like  Your mind just  Shut down  Shut down  But like when you're half awake  You're thinking weird stuff  Like you ever be  Yeah  If you're half awake  I think really  I think pretty well  All the time Sam  No if you're half awake  If you're not asleep  But your eyes are shut  You could have a whole story  Going on  Like a daydream  Yeah  And then all of a sudden  You wake up and go  Holy shit  But why does  Your brain continue to work  While you're sleeping  Like  It's gotta do something  Gets you bored  But who decided that 
[02:07:00]  The skeleton crew comes on  Jesus  Or why  Or maybe that's something else  Fucks around with things  You think it might be something else  Like the night shift  At a bakery  They all throw dough at each other  You can't do it during the day  You get in trouble  But at night  You can have a dough fight  I have dreams  That's what the brain is  Right  I have dreams of dead dad  Oh jeez  And it seems  Completely real  Those go away after a while  I remember hooking up with pops  After he died  And I'm just like  I didn't even think like  Oh I'm talking to the dead guy  It was just like  Oh I'm back at the ranch  Yeah  And walking around  And he's like 
[02:07:30]  Hey how you doing  Jesus Christ  I'm dead  Son of a bitch  I'm dead  You ever have the  Yeah you have these dreams  Or whatever  And you're like  Oh my pops is still alive  And you wake up with a smile  Like oh yeah  Everything's  Oh I guess I'm gonna  Oh god he's dead  That's right  I'm never ever gonna see him again  But for a moment  You're tricked into thinking  That you know  Nah he's still around  Yeah yeah  We just had a thing  But think of it this way too  Let's say he was alive right  And you did the exact same thing 
[02:08:00]  You did in your dream  And then that was over  Right  That's the same memory  You would have of it  Because it's not  It's not a viable thing anymore  It's just a memory  True  And the dream is a memory  So it's like  You kind of were hanging out  For a little while  True  Yeah  Same emotions  Yeah  Although  Sometimes he turns into a chicken  Or yeah  Or sometimes it totally changes  And I'm running a machine press  I don't know what happens  Stupid dreams  I think that dreaming shit  There's something to it 
[02:08:30]  I think there's something going on there  Yeah  I don't know what though  There's too many nocturnal emissions  For it to actually mean something  Wet dreams  Yeah way too many of those  I haven't had a wet dream in a while  They're pretty fun  They rule  That is some cool ass shit  How do you get a wet dream  You just have to not have sex for a while  Or watch QVC  I don't even think there's a trick to it  I always thought  Because  There was a point in my life  Wet dreams are so cool  I actually held out  Oh yeah  I did  Yeah  I held out 
[02:09:00]  Going alright  Any night now  I'm going to have one of those  Amazing wet dreams  A nice wet dream  But I gave up on that  Because then there was too much time  In between the wet dreams  I'm all sticky  I don't think there's a rhyme or reason  Because I've done that  Where it's been a while  And then a wet dream comes  But then I've also done it  Where I just came  Like yesterday  Oh Jesus  And then there's another wet dream  Oh really?  Yeah  So it's not about holding out  I don't think so  I always thought it was about the sperm  Just building up inside  And you needed a release  No it's just your mind  So your brain says 
[02:09:30]  Look it's time to get rid of this shit  It's time to get  No it's time to start thinking  Some naughty thoughts  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And then your dick goes  Whoa what's going on here  Brain you're telling me to do something  Yeah  And the brain is like  I'm liking this right now  You do what I say  Naughty naughty  If you're in a dream though  And you start realizing you're dreaming  You can do things  Like you can actually go  Oh fuck  That's mind control though  That's tough  I've done that  You're good at that  Quite a few times  But I can't do it at will  It has to happen in the dream 
[02:10:00]  Something so weird and ridiculous  Has to happen in the dream  Where dreamy me  Says  Whoa what the fuck is that  Oh it's a dream  And then here's how I test out  If I'm dreaming in a dream  When I know it's probably a dream  I look out the window  Into the darkness  And I put on like a fear face  I go like  Oh  Like ah  And if something starts coming out of the darkness at me  I know it's not real  It's a dream  Like sometimes it's a monster  Sometimes it's bad guys 
[02:10:30]  Right  But then I'll realize like  Oh shit  Now I'm just dreaming  And then I could fend them off  And then I try flying  And then I usually go  Conscious in your dreams  Yeah but at that point  You're on the brink of waking up  Right  So it sucks  You can't really  And I'm always rushing to do so many things  Because I know I'm dreaming  That I wind up waking myself up  I usually go on  I go on a rape fucking rampage too  Come on  I run  And just grab girls  And just start ripping their clothes off  To rape them 
[02:11:00]  Do you really?  Yeah because I'm dreaming  I can't get in trouble  Fuck it  Wait let me go with that point  Because I uh  I have stupid morals in my dreams  And it frustrates me  Morals  It frustrates me  I'm like you don't need morals in your dreams  Yeah you should do too  If I don't know I'm dreaming  I get to the point where I could have  Sex with a woman in the dreams  And all of a sudden I'm like  The morals  Because you don't know you're dreaming  What?  Because you don't know you're dreaming  If once you know you're dreaming  Then how do you  Yeah but you know why  Write a book then  How do you do that?  I don't know  Because it'll be a bestseller  I just fall into it 
[02:11:30]  My morals are in my fucking dreams  Because Opie you  If rape was legal  You still wouldn't rape  Because you'd know the emotional toll  It has on women  Whereas Anthony  Are you saying  Yes  If rape was legal  I would rape  Yes you would  I don't know about that sir  I believe you would  I dreamy rape  But that's about it  If it was legal you would do it  But I want to be in a world  In a dream world  Where all bets are off  Because you're dreaming  It's great  But for some reason  There's a guilt that is  Because you're a good person  The guilt  While I'm dreaming 
[02:12:00]  Fuck that  Fight it  Just be a good person  What is he saying about me?  I'm saying you would rape  You in essence are saying  I'm a horrible person  No I think you're very endearing  But you would rape  So you're all in  In your dreams  When it comes to like  Doing crazy shit  Yeah  Fuck I'm not  God I'm not  Don't worry about it  Quick on the bounce there  Embrace the goodness  Quick on the bounce  Some of these people  Very good  I have great admins in my room  Why are they bouncing?  Just bad mouths  You can't come in there  And start bad mouthing the girls 
[02:12:30]  In my fucking pal talk room  What?  Motherfuckers  You start fucking  Getting all horned out  Fucking jacking off  I don't like jackers in my room  No  This ain't your dream motherfucker  Exactly  But I keep trying to bounce people  But boy  Johnny on the spot there  Yeah  So if you're in a dream  And know you're dreaming  Why does that make you a bad person  If you do things  That you couldn't possibly do  In real life  Because that means  That there is some part of you  That would like to do that  Look  And what's holding you back 
[02:13:00]  Is a law  Or not like  I don't want to do that  Because it's not  A good thing to do  You don't think  That when I know I'm dreaming  And I choose to rape  You don't think  That I also know  That not only  There's no legal ramifications  I know that that person  In the dream  Is not going to  Be hurt  Or have any lasting effect  Because they're dreamy people  No  You don't think  That's the thing  That drives me  To dream rape  Absolutely not  Oh you're crazy  No  Who doesn't want a dream rape  I would dream rape  I don't think you would  Because you didn't 
[02:13:30]  You don't  Yeah but  I like dream raping  No because  It's a dream  Who gives a fuck  I think you would like  No one's going to hold you  To a dream ever  The dream police  Da da da da da da  No they  There's no way  You wouldn't dream rape  If you knew you were fucking  What are you going to  Take the chance of waking up  In the middle of  Courting a girl  For a dream  What are you having  In a long term relationship  That might get sexual  After a week of dreamy time  Fuck that  I would like that dream 
[02:14:00]  I would like the idea  Oh god  Of a reoccurring  Courting dream  You want a courting  You want a far  I mean  I'm raping  My whole life  I wanted to fall in love  Granted  But I don't want to  Fall in love in my dreams  I want to meet a girl  In my dreams  I want to get some shit done  And then kind of like  Build up  And after like a few weeks  Then we start kissing  And stuff  Oh god  I would do that  Raper  I believe I could rape you  In my dreams  But that's what you want to do too  You just want a minute  That's why it doesn't 
[02:14:30]  That's why you don't rape in your dreams  I don't want to fall in love  In my dreams  You idiot  Yes you do  You get softies  Deal with it  You're a softie  That's stupid  Why you're a softie  You never see these girls again  In your dreams  Oh man  Now what are you going to think  When I fucking  You know  If I'm hanging out  And I'm with a  Very attractive girl  And I go  She's the girl of my dreams  You're going to go  Oh shit  He raped her  And she's just 
[02:15:00]  Shaking  She's shaking  Help me  She's mouthing  Help  Me  Call  The police  Dream  Raper  I believe  I could jam it  In your ass  Do you ass rape  In your dreams  Um  No  I rarely ever even get it in  That's so funny though  Because you can't rape  It's not even like  Your instinct  Like in the back of your brain  It's when you are conscious  Of the fact that you are dreaming  You go  Oh boy  This means I can fly 
[02:15:30]  And rape  Yeah those are the two things  I want to do the most  Fly and rape  Isn't that amazing  Yeah that sounds good  That sounds like a perfect dream  No the girls aren't really  That's a good question  Are the girls crying  Or something in their dream  No  Do you know the girls ever  Let me think  Let me think  I know them in the dream  Oh  That's weird  Because it doesn't  It doesn't just turn up  Like I go  Oh I know I'm dreaming  And then I start raping  Yeah  Like I'll have to be  It's a situation where  Maybe there's a girl  In the dream at the time 
[02:16:00]  And I don't even know  I'm dreaming yet  And we're hanging out  Or something's going on  And then all of a sudden  I go  Oh it's a dream  And then we've been  Hanging out the whole time  But I'll just grab her  And start fucking ripping  Her clothes off  Like Alex  Yeah  It doesn't matter  Because at that point  It doesn't matter  Are you sure it's a dream  I mean  You have woken up  Where you go  Oh my god  I am in such trouble  I'm in trouble  Because it works the other way  Then you realize it's a dream  You go  Holy fuck  Oh that was a dream  And it's the biggest relief ever  It is really weird  That the police aren't chasing you  You didn't murder anyone  All this crap 
[02:16:30]  You're instantly out of trouble  When you open your eyes  What if it's this  Everyone goes to sleep  At night  Right  And all of a sudden  You're having sex with a girl  In your dream  But it's an actual girl  That's dreaming somewhere else  And in some weird  Oh my god  Other universe  You're connecting through a dream  Oh man  So she's like  Oh my god  I got raped last night  I keep having dreams  Fucking creep  Raped me last night  Some guy  Some Italian guy  Keeps raping me  And then he flies away  You're like Freddy Krueger  Yeah  The other thing about dreams quickly 
[02:17:00]  Because we've got to get to the sauce guys  Because we're all starving  Sauce guys  I think interpreting dreams  Is all bullshit  Because you only remember  The last couple dreams you have  Yeah that's true  Right  Yeah  Right  So you don't think I can interpret  Ant's dreams as  He's a guy who wants to rape  But it's illegal  Nah because  He might have had  How many times you dream a night  The average dream is less than a minute  Or something they say  Some they say  But I don't think that's true  I've had all-nighters  There's probably hundreds of dreams  There's probably hundreds of dreams every night  But you don't remember most of them  So maybe in those dreams  Ant's a good guy 
[02:17:30]  Just holding hands with chicks  Yeah right  Until I realize I'm dreaming  Wait  There's some rape going on  I don't really get  I don't  I don't get the concept of  Realizing you're dreaming  It's fucking weird  I've done it before  That's very like  That's a very  Oh I'm dreaming  Oh this is great  That's a very precarious  Place to be in  Yeah  I'm thinking  Yeah  Where at any moment  It could change  And wake you up  Because you realize you're dreaming  It's weird  There have been times too  I've fallen  I've fallen back into  Not knowing I'm dreaming  From knowing  Like I'm dreaming 
[02:18:00]  I know I'm dreaming  And then  Because I remember it  In the morning  When I wake up  And then you know you're dreaming  You fuck around  You do something  You rape  You fly  Whatever you want to do  In your dream  And then something happens  That brings you right back  Into the dream  And you're like  You don't know  You're dreaming anymore  Yeah  Weird  I've never raped  But like I've been like  You've got to give that a whirl  In your dreams  And I'm lost somewhere  I remember specifically  I'm like oh my god  I'm lost  I'm never going to get home  Yeah  And then I go  Oh wait  This is just a dream  Who cares  Who cares  That's where the rape comes in 
[02:18:30]  Because it's like  Who cares  She don't care  Sam  Watch  Watch this  Sam  We come from a time  Where um  They didn't define date rape yet  Oh man  Right  That was just called  A good girl  They definitely defined  Grabbing a girl  And tearing her clothes off  If I can  You know why  Because I know  Anne wants to rape rape  Here's what it is  I know that I could wake up  At any second  It's a very  Very light sleep  When you know you're dreaming  I've popped out of them 
[02:19:00]  Sometimes  And gone  Fuck man  God  I was just ready to rape her  And then your chick  Is sleeping next to you  And sees your  You pelvic thrusting the bed  And goes  Oh man  Oh he's having  He's having another rape dream  God damn it  Oh look at him  He's raping again  Kevin in Jersey  Brain doesn't go to sleep  Only your body does  Yeah but why was it set up that way  That's why I think  There might be something going on  That we just don't understand yet  The brain is a powerful beast  Sure is  I'm learning that in meditation class  See how much calmer I am  Ant doesn't meditate  But he rapes in his dreams  You're not going to let that go 
[02:19:30]  That definitely is  Boy I wonder what you're going to talk about  At ten o'clock today  So the thing is  It's such a light sleep  That I don't want to wake up  Before I get some action  And miss out on the raping  So I have to quickly  Like  It's like  Get the clothes off  Come on  Rip them off  And just like  Jam it in  So the only reason you sleep  Is to rape  Ah  To sleep  Perchance to rape  Did you ever  Did you ever go to sleep  And ask  Because sometimes 
[02:20:00]  Like I'll go to sleep  And I've been having  A reoccurring dream  And I'll go  Oh I hope I visit  That dream again tonight  And see where it leads  Yes yes  Do you ever go to sleep  Thinking  Oh man  I hope I raped tonight  No because it's so rare  I know it probably won't happen  So there's no use  In really hoping for it  It's a treat  If it's a surprise  And I get to do it  Yeah  Oh it's the fucking best  Why wouldn't you  Jesus  Why the hell wouldn't you  What a treat  Alright we gotta take a break  The sauce guys  Our sauce is getting cold  Isn't it  When they come back 
[02:20:30]  They'll be ready  Alright  They're gonna set it up  All nice  Yeah  And then they get the hell  Out of the studio  Yeah  Food good  We're gonna have to talk  To them right  Food guys talk  Not so good  Not so good  So where are you guys from  Well we brought this product  Very proud of  From  All right  It's based on a recipe  That was handed down  From my mother  One hand on the collar  One hand on the pants  Out the door  Oh yeah  Jazzy Jeff these motherfuckers  Well my great great grand  Came to the very grave

[02:30:00]  Let me tell you how good this is  I don't give a fuck how bad this is  As far as radio goes  I want to go to commercials so I can pig out  Roland's gonna be like  This is a Lexus dealer that I've met on the  He's driving around in a nice car  I told the  The guy that runs the movie theater  I told the Lexus story recently  How you didn't give yours back  I wasn't giving mine back  I actually got in trouble  And they actually had to repo your free car  Yeah, we were both supposed to get it 
[02:30:30]  Get a Lexus  But, and I remember we argued with people  Like, that means the car's that good  That he refuses to give it back  Yeah  What was it?  We both got matching Lexuses  Yep  And you gave yours back  And I was like  I kept getting calls  Like, you gotta bring it back  I'm like, yeah, yeah, tomorrow  How long did we get them?  I think they gave it to us for two weeks  And a couple months in  They were like, you know  They were begging for their car back  Yeah  I passed that dealership  Because it's on the west side  And then they had to  Yeah, they had to drive up 
[02:31:00]  And take it  They pretty much repoed  From the garage  That we, the parking garage  Right  They repoed the car  They gave me a free car to use for a month  And it had to be repossessed  We beat the shit out of those cars  That was the fastest I ever went in a car  Crazy, right?  I only, like  I tapped out at around 100  And I don't know  Not 100 and maybe like  Do you want to go too fast?  No, I'm scared  I'm not going to lie to you  I couldn't handle that speed  I like going fast in cars  It's so much fun  Do you still go fast in your car?

[02:38:30]  Oh, I hope it's good.  Oh, really?  Sunday gravy. Wow, I know. That was so self-serving, but I don't give a fuck. That was really good.  Yeah, when you say you want a pasta, I go, I'm not the guys.  That's a real pasta. That's all I want right there. Good meat sauce. Don't fuck around with it too much.  They did a pasta al dente, they did everything. Wow, really good. The meat wasn't fatty.  Mm-mm. That's so good.  But we didn't know what to do with the guys. What, all of a sudden they're going to do radio with us? 
[02:39:00]  I know.  What are you going to do, huh?  Mm-hmm.  What are you going to do?  Mm-hmm.  And they're jarring their sauce. That's where they can make some money.  Yeah.  Get that shit in some supermarkets.  But I hear it's tough when you have a new product. You can't really get it in a supermarket.  You know what companies pay for? The shelf space, like the good locations in supermarkets?  That's a big thing. I didn't know that.  You know the shit that's way low? Those companies are cheap.  Yeah.  They're really cheap. They don't want to pay the man.  Yeah, way at the bottom of the fucking, uh, way at the bottom of the, uh, the, the shelves? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Buried behind it?  Yeah.  That's why they always put the Goya beans.  Yeah.  Goya products. You always see like, oh, the rice is down there and all that big, heavy fucking bag shit.  Because those people are short, so they don't mind as much.  Goya, oh, boy.  Those people. Wow, they are really happy on the Today Show today.  Oh, yeah, they love it.  We'll talk to Jenna in just a moment. Also, if you have a kid who's going off to camp,  see, there you go. That's... 
[02:40:00]  We know that deal.  They fucking hose it down and they just move on.  She's, she never existed.  She never existed, this Aunt Carrie.  Persona non grata.  Nope. They give you the fake, we give a fuck about you, farewell, and then the next day, man.  Goodbye.  They spray everything. Sometimes they give it a new paint job or something.  Yeah, they'll change it around. They'll, they'll move a few things.  They'll get a new table for the, for the fucking couch.  That's what happened with us at AF.  Oh, yeah. Hose it down.  Stupid Dave Douglas held such a grudge that they did a retrospective on AF, because AF was 
[02:40:30]  a very important station for a long time up there in Western Massachusetts slash, slash Boston.  Yep.  So they did like a, I don't know, 20, 25 year retrospect of the radio station.  And we had a very slight mention that we were in there because of something else.  So they had to mention us.  Yeah, they had to mention us.  They pretty much had to put us in there.  But besides that, it was like we never existed. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Because Dave Douglas was in charge of the whole, you know, thing that they were doing.  The whole write-up.  I don't think I'll put them in.  I got to bring that in.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  We never existed.  And we were a huge part of the most successful period that that station had.  Oh, God.  We put them on the map.  Everyone said it.  Like, no show ever beat BCN and the Boston stations in general.  And we were the first.  We were the first.  But, man, when it came time to write about the history of the station, you can't find us in this publication. 
[02:41:30]  It was FMQB, I believe.  Motherfuckers.  Well, you weren't his friend.  He wanted you to be friends.  No.  And you weren't his friend.  None of these people are my friends.  I got friends, though.  I got a lot of friends, Sam.  I just don't, you know, share that knowledge with people.  They're private people, too.  Where do you meet your friends?  Oh, my God.  I'm having another kid.  It just hit me.  Well.  Oh, my God.  I'm having another kid. 
[02:42:00]  Well.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Dropping that fucking bomb right here.  My God.  Oh, my God.  We ran out of things to talk about, so I figured I had to say that today.  Look at that.  Wow.  Wow.  Are you going to name it Sam?  Supposedly, the info is already out there, but.  This kid's going to be named East.  But people weren't totally.  I get it.  Hope he wants to cover all the major waterways with his child's names. 
[02:42:30]  I'm having another kid.  I guess that's official.  Damn.  Even though the people that are good at reading between the lines figured it out a while ago.  Yeah, that's true.  Dice said something.  He didn't even know.  You sure he didn't know?  Who would have told him?  I just looked down like, what the fuck?  Who would have told him?  At that point, I didn't even tell.  You were the only one that knew at that point.  At that point, I didn't even tell Ant.  And he's like, hey, I hear you're having a kid.  And I'm like, who's the rat?  Yeah.  Considering they were.  Hey, you're having a kid.  But I think he was just guessing.  Yeah, I think he was just fucking around.  But then I panicked and went, well, maybe. 
[02:43:00]  Who knows?  Who knows?  Yeah.  Is that what he said?  Yeah, something like that.  People want to know how far along.  Really far along.  That's how I do things.  It is pretty far along.  Yeah, when I told Ant.  She was showing at the Sam's wedding.  Yeah, she was not happy about that.  Why?  Yeah, why?  She wanted to be your own.  It's not like she fucking ate and got that fucking big.  Did you almost say the word that women don't want to hear?  I almost got that fat.  I know.  Hey, believe me.  After yesterday's show, what, do you think I'm really good with the ladies and keeping  them happy?  Fuck. 
[02:43:30]  No, she's upset.  She's doing good, but she didn't want to be pregnant at your wedding, that's for sure,  Sam.  Why?  Considering she was in it and all that shit.  Yeah.  But I don't even understand why.  I don't understand why that was a concern.  Mm-hmm.  Because women want to look their best, especially at weddings.  You know the sex?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I do.  Yeah?  Oh, I ain't saying it right now.  But you know what it is?  You got to.  We're having a friend.  Oh, yeah, I do.  Oh, come on.  From that, I think I know.  I thought I told you. 
[02:44:00]  No.  Oh.  Oh, man.  I thought I told you that.  From that answer, I think I know, because I've heard you talk before.  Oh, God.  Thank God I'm going to be a very old fuck when it matters.  Did you?  Okay.  That's making it pretty obvious.  Thank fucking God.  Were you, with the ultrasound, were you like, keep looking?  Kid, just please, please, go over it again.  Oh, I know.  And what I said when I found out wasn't pretty.  Oh, no. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, no.  My exact quote was, I'm going to have to deal with.  Anthony in 16 years?  Ah, see, I can make fun of myself, too.  I actually said, I'm going to have to fucking deal with assholes coming to my house.  Yep.  That's exactly what I said.  And then everyone in the room is like, whoa, this is supposed to be a nice moment.  It is a nice moment, but you're not the one that has to deal with these fucking assholes  when they come around in a few years.  One day, somebody's going to come to you and say, Mr. Hughes, I've been dating her for 
[02:45:00]  a long time, and I wanted to know if I could have your permission.  Oh, gosh.  This is what I play around my pool.  To marry her.  This is my pool music.  Thank you.  Thank God.  I'm going to be old as dirt, and it's just not going to matter.  You want to buy one of my guns?  Yeah, I do.  I'll sell you a shoddy cheap.  Yeah, I do.  Fuck.  Oh, and then, oh, my God, and the people are like, how much is he going to have to spend 
[02:45:30]  on her wedding?  Oh, MTV Super Speed 16.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  Daddy, I wanted the Lexus.  Oh, my God.  Daddy.  And I thought I saw a dick.  You did?  Yeah, I thought I knew more than everyone in the room.  And I'm like, all right, I'll keep it to myself.  I already know, because I'm smart.  Then it turns out I was completely wrong.  It wasn't.  No.  Daddy.  I sure have an older brother to take care of her, too.  Yeah, that's kind of cool.  Got that going for you. 
[02:46:00]  He'll kick some ass if anyone gives her grief.  Why don't you stop looking at my fucking sister?  Yeah, me and Joe did that for my sister, Dawny.  Really?  Until I found condoms in the top drawer of her dresser.  And then I'm just like, all bets are off the slut.  My sister, the whore.  Yeah.  No.  Wonderful.  No, she was going out with this guy, Tommy Tucker, his name was.  Mm-hmm.  He was a little wormy kid and shit.  And I had no clue.  Like, this shit was going on. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  I thought they were, you know, cute little fucking boyfriend, girlfriend thing.  He was laying the pipe to her.  Really?  Yeah, they had fucking, we had to move her dresser in her room.  So we opened the top drawer a little, get your hand in there.  Right.  And me and my brother, and we'd lift it up, and then I looked, I was going, Joe, holy  shit, look.  Fucking condoms in her upper drawer.  In her top drawer.  No kidding.  Damn, yo.  You know, me and my brother were talking to me the other day that we think our sister  was a slut, too.  Little whore?  Damn, we think she might have been. 
[02:47:00]  She listens.  Fuck.  I'm sorry.  That's not as mine.  She'll hear it.  I'm sorry.  Was she going to deny it?  I'm sorry.  Fucking condoms.  So when does this happen?  When does Miss Opie come?  Really soon.  How soon?  I'm good at keeping shit.  Princess Hughes.  Princess Hughes.  Princess Hughes.  Is that going to be her name?  There's no way I'm going to be able to do radio after this.  Oh, man.  Yeah, how are you going to objectify females?  I'm going to enjoy the next three months, because after that.  Objectify females.  How are you going to objectify females when you have one at home? 
[02:47:30]  I don't do that.  A little bit.  It's all right.  It's all good.  Not so much these days.  It's all in good fun.  Not so much these days.  Oh, you're really not going to want to hear it.  Operina.  That's a horrible name.  And this is Operina?  Opeta.  Oh, God.  But you're not going to want to hear ants singing Bachelor Ways.  Huh?  I don't.  So wait, like this.  Why are you asking questions?  It's not your show. 
[02:48:00]  I know.  That's why I got to get the answers.  So by the end of the summer?  Or no?  Not that soon?  Soon.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Really soon.  I'm happy.  Now, do you have room?  What?  Do you have room?  Yeah.  In your place?  Yeah.  For two kids once they start getting a little older?  I got room.  Yeah.  No, no.  I know you got room, but is it like...  They'll all sleep in my bed.  Oh, shit.  Just add another one to the bed.  Is the little guy still sleeping in your bed? 
[02:48:30]  Sometimes.  Oh, he...  Yeah.  It's our little nest.  So you can't have two babies in the bed.  Some name suggestions.  Tappan Zee.  Long Island Sound Hughes.  I would like to...  That would be nice.  I would like a nice New York name.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How about Marich's Inlet?  Oh, that's not bad.  I could work with that.  Yeah.  Eaton's Neck.  Eaton's Neck.  Ashroken Hughes.  Ashroken.  Ashroken Hughes.  That's going local.  But are you worried that the little guy is going to get upset when the new baby is now 
[02:49:00]  in your bed?  Oh, boy.  And the little guy has to get in his own bed?  No, man.  It's going to be everyone...  Everyone just getting into bed?  Yeah.  Just find a spot.  Good night, John Boy.  No, I'm very excited.  This is exciting.  That is.  It's something...  It's pretty cool.  Really never talked about for many years of our careers, but always wanted.  And blah, blah, blah.  So it's now happening.  Oh, my gosh.  You're going to have a little...  That's an old fuck.  ...perfect blonde Aryan family.  Oh, man.  Right?  A boy, a girl, blonde hair, blue eyes. 
[02:49:30]  Damn.  Yeah.  There's some privilege going on.  Goose-stepping.  Oh, so you're going to have to draw on their faces.  Yeah, you will.  About how privileged they are to be white.  The perfect little life they're going to have because they're white kids.  Right.  Man, on the black market, well, no pun.  A little white kid like that, what they would go for?  Jesus.  So are you stressing about it all the time, or it's not in your head all the time?  Well, I would have preferred another son. 
[02:50:00]  Really?  Your son.  Just because everyone tells me they're easier, and I'm finding that out for myself.  Plus, you know how to do it now.  And I don't want to deal with assholes coming to my house.  That's, uh, and boy, you're really not going to be, uh, you know, ready to stand up to  these young whippersnappers at that point.  Oh, God, no.  Think about it.  I'll be, I'll be carrying guns by then.  Yeah, you have to.  I'll have to.  Just sitting.  An old man with a shotgun.  Sitting in a chair with a blanket over your knees to keep him warm.  And a shotgun.  Guns to take, uh, take care of my fading muscles. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  You're young at heart, is the thing.  Oh, look at this.  E-Rock's fucking pulling out all the, all the stops.  All the songs.  This was a song for you.  Well, according to my Twitter, it looks like people didn't know.  No, people didn't know.  I guess only a few figured it out.  How would they have known?  I don't know.  I asked Dan about it.  I go, I think they already know.  He goes, yeah, I think so, too.  No way.  Wow.  That's pretty.  So, he's not gonna.  We're very excited.  And it's gonna be sooner than later. 
[02:51:00]  How much sooner, though?  Very soon.  Oh, my gosh.  Soon.  Oh, yeah, soon.  Someone said, if you want a New York name, what about that place in Brooklyn?  You can name her, uh, Dumbo Hughes.  After her father.  Yes.  Slide her right.  Shut up.  I know it's yours.  I stole it.  People want credit.  Fucking pal talk.  You people are getting a little uppity.  Why?  They want credit for their jokes now.  What is this?  A fucking, what is this?  A union gig you guys got? 
[02:51:30]  I give credit.  You give credit.  I do, too.  But sometimes, it's not appropriate for the joke.  You know what I find out?  How do you feel with the joke if you give credit?  You know what I find out?  Sometimes I'll say a line.  Yeah.  And then, either someone on Twitter or someone on the Instant Feedback had a similar line or the same line.  Oh, yeah.  And then they're convinced I ripped them off.  How about we both figured out a similar line, asshole?  They go, that's mine.  Fuck you.  I wasn't even looking at the screen.  It's like, I haven't even checked the screen in a while.  So relax.  Bastards.  Have you thought about names yet?  Do you have credit when I can? 
[02:52:00]  No.  No?  Not yet?  No.  Yes.  You have.  No.  You have a little bit.  Does Linz have any ideas for names that she's pretty adamant about as far as girlie names go?  No.  Is she excited?  Is the wife excited?  Yes.  She's got to be.  Everyone's excited.  Is she happier?  Is she really happy to have a daughter, though?  What?  Is she really happy that it's a girl?  Yeah.  I think it's the first girl in her family since her.  Wow.  Oh, that's right. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  So this is kind of rare.  Oh, man.  What a spoiled kid.  Kind of a rare thing.  Kid's going to be one of those spoiled kids with the first girl like that?  Oh, man.  My side of the family, we're 50-50.  Girls to boys.  This generation having kids.  That's good.  Your side, not so much.  You already told everybody in your family, right?  I didn't tell my mom yet.  Is that true?  That's not true.  What?  About what?  You're having another kid.  You didn't tell your mom that?  Oh, yeah.  I did tell her.  You told her.  What?  You had to have told her.  I think I told her, yeah. 
[02:53:00]  These people are going to be pissed off if they're in your family and you announce it on  the air.  Oh, you know what?  There's a shitload of people that don't know.  Oh, well, they do know.  I got a lot of hueses on Long Island.  They have no idea.  Isn't that handy to have a radio show?  So it's like, hey, now they all know.  I don't have to talk to them.  Right.  Soon.  Yeah.  Because then you're on the phone with them or something.  They're like, that's fantastic.  Oh, so.  And now you just don't want to hear anything.  You fulfilled your obligation to tell them.  So now it's radio.  Needless to say, this will be baby's first Christmas this year.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Oh.  Whoa.  So you're going to get a baby's first Christmas.  Oh, yeah.  Easy.  First Halloween, even.  Whoa.  Oh, now we're talking soon.  Labor Day?  Holy shit.  Baby's first Fourth of July?  Could be baby's first.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Could be baby's first Fourth of July.  Oh, God.  How are you going to have two kids if first one exhausts you?  Yeah, that's why I'm most likely not doing radio anymore.  That's it, huh?  Haven't you figured that out yet?  Dan in Virginia, what's up?  Hey, uh, no one's asking important questions. 
[02:54:00]  Who's the dad, do you know?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He got you.  He got you with that.  What a distasteful joke to bring up in such a time of joy.  On a happy moment like this?  Come on.  I'm trying to think of what this one is.  Which one is this, E-Rock?  This is some Joe Cocker.  E-Rock, are you pregnant yet?  He just looks it.  He admitted.  He's trying.  You're trying?  We're trying.  Not yet.  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  She won't have sex with him.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:54:30]  Is your oldest son going to be jealous now?  I guess.  Oh.  Man.  E-Rock, are you going to be jealous?  E-Rock.  I'll tell you this much, because, you know, you got me in a weak moment.  My kid fucking loves E-Rock and his wife.  Oh.  I guess somebody has to.  I'm kidding.  E-Rock treats my son very nicely, so I should be better to E-Rock because of that.  Aw.  You'd think. 
[02:55:00]  You would think, right?  But that's not the nature of this show.  Oh, E-Rock.  You could name the baby Sam still.  Samantha is still a suitable girl's name.  That's true.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  Why?  God.  It's a very strong name.  Sam Hughes.  How about Erica for E-Rock?  See?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  The name just hasn't done him any good, so I'm just thinking. 
[02:55:30]  You know, I didn't want to do this today, but we ran out of material.  See what we do?  I love it.  That went right to the front end.  That's what happens.  Ant was very open yesterday.  Opie today.  Delve into the personal life.  I thought we'd get a little more out of the sauce, guys.  I thought they would bring us to the end.  I'm like, all right, and then I'll wait a few more weeks.  She's going to have to go to prom, you know?  I know.  Oh, God.  That's the benefit of being an old father.  At least they'll have flying cars by then, though.  There'll be a flying limo.  Yeah.  That's true.  They'll be waving. 
[02:56:00]  They'll be waving in the back.  Watch out for Biff Tannen.  Yes.  Guys like that, anyway.  Guys like Biff.  Wow.  Someday you're going to be my wife.  You're my girl.  Oh, better.  Oh, better.  And you got any kids?  What?  None that I know.  You're going to have, like, a family.  There's going to be two kids.  I have a feeling there might be another one out there. 
[02:56:30]  I just get a creepy feeling.  You think you have another kid?  Crazy.  That you don't know about?  That would be in its 20s.  I just have a creepy feeling that someday that door is opening.  Hi.  Hi, Daddy.  Oh, God.  FH Riley Hughes.  Well, no, man.  Riley's already in our family.  Hence the Riley part of FH Riley.  If I had a kid when my wife wanted us to have one and we're trying to have one at some point, 
[02:57:00]  that kid would have been, like, 20 years old now.  20?  Wow.  20 years old.  He would have loved the compound, too.  Me and your kid would have hung out, like, dudes.  You guys would have been double dating.  Oh, please.  You would have, though.  I'd have to change my lifestyle.  He would be able to bring the chicks over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The chicks.  Dad, stop fucking my dates.  Hey.  Come on, son.  What are you doing?  Loosen up.  Don't worry about it.  Loosen up.  Have a drink.  Have a drink.  All right.  Someone nailed the due date. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, literally nailed it to the day.  Are you kidding?  To the day.  What did they say?  I ain't saying.  Damn it.  For now?  Who's this Lindsay person?  Wow.  Man.  Nailed it.  Wow.  Nailed it.  Good job there, sir.  All right.  Can we go home now?  Nope.  Fuck!  There's more questions.  Odara Hughes?  Odara?  He wanted one word.  Odara.  If I named babies like I named my pets, I would have a son named Killer Kowalski. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, God.  You're going to name your kids after wrestlers?  I should.  You really should.  I will name you Hulk Roberts.  Oh, my God.  You'll be outside Ligellen for your kid?  Jake the Snake!  Jake the Snake!  Time for dinner.  Yeah.  Big Boss Man!  Big Boss Man.  You Big Boss Man Roberts, you get your butt in here.  I'm so going to be a part-timer in a few months.  Man. 
[02:58:30]  Jimmy and I will do a good show, though.  I thought that...  Oh, hey, down the port.  I'm so fucking done.  I thought that maybe...  How am I supposed to do this and raise two little kids?  But maybe...  And I'm not getting no fucking nanny.  You would keep doing the show because you need the loot now.  Are you kidding me?  You got two college tuitions you're going to have to pay for.  You got two college tuitions.  You got two proms.  You got two sets of birthday parties.  And you got to start paying for other people's health care.  Yeah.  You got kids trying to come out.  Come on.  Until they're 26. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you got to keep working.  You need the dough.  It's going to be pretty much impossible.  What about the money?  The money?  Yeah.  What about the money?  You need to put the kids through college.  You have college funds for the kids yet?  Oh, man.  No, my kid is...  They're not going to college.  What?  Unless college changes.  Oh, it's a waste of time.  You can afford it.  You can send your kids to college.  Help them start a business at 18.  A business?  Yeah.  You got to send your kids to college.  College is a waste of time. 
[02:59:30]  No, it's not.  If I didn't go to college...  Unless we discover they have some kind of special talent, then yeah.  If I didn't go to college, I never would be here.  I didn't believe college was a waste of time until recently.  College is not a waste of time.  Putting your kids and yourself in debt for what?  You don't have to put yourself in debt.  You can afford tuition.  Well, you could have used that money, and then you could have maybe got a business going  right away.  But if you can afford college, it's not a waste of time.  I think it's a waste of time in general.  You can afford to put your kids to college.  A few extra courses after high school, sure.  No.  College, college.  You can afford to put your kids to college.  We were talking about dreams before. 
[03:00:00]  Opie's brand new nightmare.  Here it is.  Oh, God.  Please don't.  Mr. Hughes, I'd like to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.  Mr. Hughes, and then his mom comes in.  Oh, Opie, we're going to have the cutest little grandbabies.  Let me tell you something.  That little child is so pretty.  Between her, between Opie and my Tyrone, them babies is going to look bootiful. 
[03:00:30]  Sherelle and Opie, the cutest kids.  Sherelle and Opie?  Oh, man.  It'll come down to what this gentleman does for a living.  Of course.  Huh?  You see character.  I mean, I'm out of work at the moment.  No, I...  I'm in pharmaceutical distribution.  But I have a good idea for a small business.  A small business, which I would like to ask you for a few dollars if I can. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, my God.  I need some dunkers for this shit, yo.  You will be a full partner.  Yo, partner.  You want to be a partner, partner?  No, I don't...  Oh, what?  Oh, yeah.  You're the asshole.  Stanley.  Now I can fucking...  Hey, that's king asshole to you.  King asshole.  What's up, man?  Stanley was...  Okay, okay.  Let me publicly apologize.  Stanley was the one that fucking announced it after Sam's wedding.  I heard about that.  I'm on the morning mashup.  I'm like, what are you doing? 
[03:01:30]  No one knows.  And the way I heard it, too, was that Stan...  I'm so glad it's coming out.  My mashup buddies, they told me that Stan had no reason to do it.  It was just at the end of the break.  He got excited.  And he just goes, and I also want to send a shout-out to my boy, Opie.  His wife is pregnant.  Congratulations.  Oh, shit.  We just said, I didn't even announce it on our own show.  Thank God we have no crossover audience.  Yeah, obviously.  No, actually, we do.  Because people started getting on my case as soon as I said it.  Listen, Opie, I apologized to him in a hallway.  But really, you know, I'm the only parent on the show. 
[03:02:00]  So as soon as, you know, I saw him and his wife, you know, and I see how happy and loved  they are, I was excited for him.  And I got overly excited.  Oh, man.  And I said that I had no idea that he wanted to keep it on a low, low, low, low, low,  low, low, low, low, low, like that.  He just said he was going to name his daughter Stan, so he's not that mad.  So I apologize, Opie.  But I said, and I rarely say, wait, this is, I rarely say sorry.  So I did apologize, but we did this all fair already.  We're good.  Congratulations.  We're good.  What if a Stanley T-shirt.  Even though I broke it first.  You're giving up.  You gave it up.  Let everybody know little Tawana is going to be born. 
[03:02:30]  Stanley.  Let me, well, that's a good question.  But not for marriage.  Stanley is slightly, slightly too black.  Okay.  Slightly too black.  I would be, how could you be too black?  Well, you got the thing on, the necklace.  It's a little blingy.  That gives it away.  He's in a Knicks warm-up suit.  I don't exactly think he's headed to the court right now.  Oh, shit.  Actually, I am.  You are?  You're right after the show.  You're right on the border of being slightly too black for my daughter.  All right.  To go out with the, yeah, the princess hues.  I don't see as much, I don't see color as much, I should say, as Anthony. 
[03:03:00]  Oh.  But you might be, you might be, you might be on, you might be on the other side of it.  Really?  Stan, disappointed, goes, oh, I thought you didn't see color at all.  Oh, so you're like a little racist?  Oh, man.  No, that's honest, though.  Every fucking person sees shit.  What?  You know, you keep talking like that.  That's what's going to happen to you.  Believe me.  You're going to have somebody blacking in me.  In my eye camera, my saturation's up 100%.  That's hilarious.  So congratulations again, Olin.  Stanley, thank you.  And congratulations.  And I know you were just excited when you were blown on my spot. 
[03:03:30]  I'm just excited.  No problem.  You know I'm very fond of you.  And in keeping with the theme of what we're naming kids and the possibility of having a black significant other.  What are you announcing, Sam?  Young Harlem.  Oh, Harlem Hughes.  Harlem, I like that name.  Harlem.  Oh, that would be great.  That is good.  Harlem.  I can think of what you could call it for, you know, a nickname.  Don't say it.  I would dare.  It's funny little nickname.  Oh, nickname.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Does it end in let?  No.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to get out of here right now.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, and A in the house.  Oh, why don't you go tell some more secrets?  Yeah, really?  We're going to talk about you next.  Oh, shit.  And there he goes, back to his show.  He goes on his show the day after Sam's wedding and just blows up my spot.  I'm like, dude, we've been saving it for our show.  Oh, man.  Why would you do it?  We were saving this for some filler.  Saving it for one we ran out of shit to talk about.  What a weird week.  What a weird fucking week.  It's been fun, man.  It's been a good time.  Hell's here. 
[03:04:30]  Absolutely.  Now.  Harlem.  Harlem.  Harlem.  Harlem.  It's our old name.  It works.  Yeah.  Oh.  I wonder what's going to make number one on the worst of week countdown.  Oh, man.  Is it Dan's exes?  Is it Obie's new baby?  Oh, this is a huge announcement.  Let me make it official.  I'm stepping aside.  You got to do the number one.  What?  Absolutely.  I'm stepping aside.  Hey, are we going to air that whole thing in complete?  Yes.  The hour and a half.  We broke it down into parts, but it's all there.  Oh, nice.  Because it was a long.  More phone calls. 
[03:05:00]  Some more exes will come out of the fucking woodwork to text me.  What did you do?  Was that me?  That's another one, too.  It's like other exes have texted and gone like, were you talking about me?  Right.  It's like, no.  I treated plenty of girls like shit.  Not just you.  Is your wife listening?  She's at the doctor's office right now.  So she doesn't know that you just did that?  No.  She knows I was going to do it.  She said she didn't.  She's ready for you to do it?  Yeah.  She was ready a while ago.  Ah-ha.  Thank you, everyone. 
[03:05:30]  Really.  This is great news.  No.  The Twitter's been.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  I'll have a real moment for a second.  Thank you very much.  With no sarcasm after that.  A lot of nice tweets coming in.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Yes.  When do you start buying girls' toys?  I don't know what to do with this.  You don't, do you?  Not a clue.  Oh, man.  Jess is so excited.  People know, though.  You don't have to.  I repel around with my son. 
[03:06:00]  It's like I know what to do with a boy.  We already kind of have a thing going on here.  That sounds way too much like Jerry Sandusky.  I know what to do with a boy.  But what do you do with a girl?  What do you do?  I don't know.  Jess is so excited.  You buy him dresses and bows.  And then when they get into sports, you've got to make believe their sports are as important  as male sports.  Yeah.  Softball.  Baseball.  Barbie dolls.  Sure.  Field hockey.  You get them Barbie dolls and bows for their hair.  Yeah.  And a kitten.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  And, um, hmm.  If you buy her.  You don't have to do anything with them.  I don't know.  You don't have to.  I have no idea.  What are you doing?  It's not, it's certainly not in my DNA.  You got to take her.  You know what to do with a, you know.  You do have to take her to Disney.  A son.  You do have to take her to Disney at some point.  Yeah.  Because then she wants to dress like a princess and all that.  I would like to know about you as a father, if you bought her Barbies and your son started  playing with the Barbies, is that cool?  Or would you take them away?  Jesus Christ. 
[03:07:00]  I know what Aunt Sam would do.  Son of a bitch.  It would, it would.  The hell are you trying to fucking pull here?  It, you know.  It's cool.  It's cool.  Okay.  I'm hoping that's not the case.  It is what it is.  Just because that would be a tough life.  You wouldn't want to see the sailor hat on at the parade, the shorts, the rainbow flag.  Cutting the legs off all his jeans.  What are you doing now?  Oh my God.  I would be all in, to be totally honest with you, but, you know. 
[03:07:30]  But I think like...  All in.  Don't put it that way.  Jesus.  Now you're really saying that.  Jerry Sandusky.  Yeah.  But like, I think almost every single father, you just hope that it's not.  But I'd be all in.  I wouldn't be...  Easiest possible life.  I wouldn't be an asshole dad.  Well, that's a good, that's a good question.  What if she wants to marry a guy that's like 20 years older than her?  Honestly, I wouldn't care.  Yeah.  My in-laws...  Some young shock jock comes up.  I was about to say, what's worse... 
[03:08:00]  My in-laws are way past all that.  What's worse coming through the door?  A Stanley T or an aunt?  Oh boy, let's go home.  I just know aunt too well.  You don't want me coming to the door.  I don't know aunt too well.  Believe me.  All right.  He's going to be much too good a father.  Yeah.  I answer by not answering.  He's actually going to raise her well and she won't have daddy issues.  Therefore, you wouldn't be there.  Wipe front to back.  Thank you.  Oh, good call. 
[03:08:30]  Oh God.  Yeah, you don't want to stank that up.  Oh, you're going to have to worry about that stuff.  I already got to clean balls.  Oh, fuck.  This is going to be worse, I think.  I lift up balls.  Oh, you treat E-Roc so well.  I lift up balls and clean balls.  Could you powder me?  How the fuck do you clean a vagina?  I know it's the old Louis C.K. bit, but that's going to be worse.  Louis got that great bit about just shit caked in her vagina.  Right.  Into her vagina.  And Louis got to clean it.  It's terrible. 
[03:09:00]  Man.  You know what?  The fuck are we waiting here for?  I'm a very private person, so could I be let off the hook now, please?  Have a good weekend, everybody.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm already telling people to have a good goddamn weekend.  And let me tell you something.  These last two shows, some of your best shows ever.  I've enjoyed them very much.  Thank you, Sam.  You got it.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Oh, you know what?  Certainly because Jimmy's not here.  Please, let's not forget that.  Where did he go?  Jimmy's special premieres tomorrow. 
[03:09:30]  Yes.  On Epix, EPIX.  And if you don't have that channel, a lot of us don't.  I know I don't have it.  You can go to epixhd.com, EPIXhd.com.  Jim Norton's special.  We were there for the taping, and in the end, there were issues with the first show,  but then he hit it out of the fucking park.  It's great.  It's absolutely great.  It's on tomorrow night at 10.  And you know what's great about that whole thing?  To watch Jimmy as it happened, the professionalism and being able to keep calm and cool, 
[03:10:00]  even though that first show, he had issues with some of the...  Issues?  Holy shit.  Remember how scared you were?  Dude, I wouldn't go into the dressing room that he was in.  Me and you had a talk like we were, I don't know, brothers, and our parents were fighting.  Parents were yelling, yeah.  I'll go in.  I had a flashback.  I'll go in.  I'll go in and see what's going on.  That's where I thought Jimmy was going to go, Jesus Christ!  He was that pissed.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Throw some spaghetti against the wall.  How he got it together to do the second show, I'll... 
[03:10:30]  I don't know how he did it.  I'll never know, because, you know...  He was that pissed.  When I get that pissed, unfortunately, I completely shut down and I fuck up everything.  How do they fuck up the lighting, Q?  Who's the motherfucker?  That's what we were hearing.  He was yelling at the top of his lungs, kicking things.  A garbage pill flew out of the door like Jazzy Jeff.  That's my kryptonite, man.  When I get into that zone, it's over, Johnny, unfortunately.  And I know.  I know that's one of my problems. 
[03:11:00]  Pull it together.  I don't know how people pull it together when they get an energy like that going.  Yeah.  Do you guys remember when Jimmy got mad when the foot thing fell on his foot?  The foot thing fell on his foot.  And you remember the anger in his voice?  Yeah.  That was real angry Jimmy.  Yeah.  What you were just talking about after that first show, I've never heard anything like that.  It was bizarre.  That foot thing on my foot thing was baby shit.  Long start with this dude.  I'm rude.  That was real.  I wasn't scared.  I wasn't scared for other people.  I was scared for Jimmy.  I really thought he was going to throw himself out a window. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  He was throwing shit.  It was unbelievable.  I was just talking about that with my chick yesterday.  And I said, I was like, you ever yell loud, but you could focus it.  And you could have that strength in your voice and focus it in one place.  I was like, Jimmy was so mad and yelling, he couldn't even control his own voice.  It was one of those, it was just all over the place.  It was unbelievable.  It was fucking fantastic.  Because we saw the amount of work he put into getting this whole thing together from  beginning to that moment.  It all comes down to him doing those shows. 
[03:12:00]  Right.  Every bit of work that he did before that.  If the show isn't good, it doesn't matter what he did.  It's a waste of time.  Right.  And that was all the frustration that was coming out.  All that work, getting everything in order, setting it up so nothing did go wrong.  And then to have things going on with some of the crew, and it was all technical issues.  It was nothing with him or the audience or anything like that.  He lost his fucking mind.  We were all just scared. 
[03:12:30]  Petrified!  In the little, like the green room area or whatever.  We were just quiet.  And it wasn't because anybody wanted to listen to what was going on.  I mean, yeah, we did.  But it was more just like everybody was shocked and scared and just had nothing to say.  I've never heard of that man.  Yeah, we've seen him mad, but not to that level ever.  Not to that point.  But the point being, then, I was convinced there's no...  He's going to have to reschedule this whole thing.  Yeah, how do you then do comedy?  There's no way he's going to do a second set or a second show.  And he did, and he killed it.  I mean, I want to see it anyway, but I want to see it even extra just because I want to 
[03:13:00]  see the two shows cut together.  I want to see if I could pick out one from the other.  And just know, like, oh, Jim was so mad.  He was fucking pissed right there.  And the funny thing is, the first show, he was beyond mad as he was hitting the stage  and was still funny.  Like I said, I know it's one of my curses.  I don't know how you do that.  Because my emotions always get in the fucking way, as most of you know at this point.  He's good.  He's good.  He's good that way.  He's good, that Jim Norton.  10 o'clock tomorrow night on Epix.  EpixHD.com if you don't have the channel. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, you can get a free trial, so you can watch it for free if anybody doesn't have it.  Very cool.  You bringing up your emotions getting in the way just reminded me, we think we've seen  you angry now.  Wait till you have a daughter to protect.  Oh, boy.  Like I said, I'll be old.  It won't matter.  I don't know, dude.  You're young at heart.  I'm going to start eating like shit.  You're going to age yourself?  Did you say it started today?  Started today.  Start smoking.  Yeah.  I'm going to start smoking and fucking...  Drinking heavy.  Drinking heavy. 
[03:14:00]  Bourbon.  That'll do it.  No, it's cool.  All right.  Take some pain.  All right, man.  Opal coming out.  I've got to stop smoking weed.  No, I've got to start smoking weed.  Yeah, no, don't bring that up.  Troy's pretty fucking pissed that you keep saying that and you never do it.  Troy wants to blaze up later.  Troy wants to blaze up at Opie.  Is that what it is?  He tried to at the wedding.  What happened?  And Opie said no.  Let me ask you something.  I brought killer shit for you, dude.  I got...  You've been talking so much shit.  Fucking how long?  Let me ask you, because you're a pod expert. 
[03:14:30]  Let's say someone had pod.  Right.  Let's say.  Troy did.  And it's rolled up, let's say.  Yeah.  How long does that shit keep?  30 years.  No, I'm being serious.  A, how long have you had it?  It might be...  If you were to have something like that.  Are we talking years?  It's...  No, not years.  Might have been around the time Jay Moore was here last time.  Maybe.  I don't remember that.  Just saying, maybe.  If it's out, I mean... 
[03:15:00]  As far as the reference goes on.  It's not like it's got like...  I seem to remember Jay was around at the time.  It's like all the goodness is going to fall out of it.  It'll still be there.  Let's say six to eight months.  It tastes like shit.  Yeah, it'll be dry.  It'll be like a stale cigarette.  Like it's still going to please you in some way.  It'll get you fucked up.  How come you didn't smoke with Troy at the wedding?  Because I was exhausted.  Dude, I said...  I was tired at that point.  I said, look, just take like one hit.  Just take one hit.  With you?  And breathe.  But I brought awesome shit.  Next thing you know, you're touching my pud.  I'll get it here, man.  You would touch my pud.  You're a pud toucher.  Would I touch your pud?  You would touch my pud. 
[03:15:30]  No, I would not touch your pud.  You would touch my pud.  No, I just want to get you high.  As a bro.  Yeah, because you're bro-ing down.  Just as a bro.  I mean, if you...  You would touch my pud, wouldn't you?  Not as a mo, as a bro.  It's different.  Let's just have a Monday morning vape sesh.  We should bring in some brownies for everybody, and then as the morning goes on, you guys  just keep eating more brownies.  That always works well when people bring pot brownies into the workplace.  You never hear those stories.  And once it's gone, it's gone.  Why don't we play pot brownie roulette? 
[03:16:00]  Oh, how great would that be?  Would you be in for that?  People pretending to be stoned?  I'm just going to fucking...  Oh, man.  Imagine that.  Just a few of them.  One brownie.  And one person's out of their fucking mind.  And you don't even know if you ate it, so all of a sudden, you think it's you, and  you start freaking out, but...  The rest are full of bath salts.  I'll do a...  I'll do a...  I'll do a lot from the compound just to do that.  Oh, man.  One fucking pot brownie.  Pot brownie roulette.  That'd be pretty good.  See, the thing is, sometimes when you eat it, it takes a little while to kick in. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, so...  Or if you smoke, you just eat it right away.  But you know what?  The thing about edibles, too, is that because it's a more efficient way to ingest all the goodness  in you that it hits you like five times as hard.  So if he's going to smoke or whatever, however that's going to hit him, something that's  edible is going to hit him just ten times as long.  And if he's been out of the game for so long...  Oh, he would be fucked up.  But there's no guarantee I'm going to get the pot brownie.  That stuff is out at these days, wow, he'd be fucking tripping on.  That's why I told him to take one hit.  I said, take one hit and just see where you're at.  He was pissed.  Troy was pissed. 
[03:17:00]  I was pissed, dude.  Because he just talks so much shit, man.  Oh, man.  Troy is fucking...  I'm not really talking shit, though.  Wow, Troy.  That's something I do want to do, but obviously I'm, you know, scared to jump back in.  Well, I want to smoke weed with Opie tonight.  And he was talking about it like days in advance.  I want to blaze one up.  I made sure I got real good shit.  He's like, bro, I'm going to come in with some good shit, and I'm going to talk to him  after the wedding, and I'm going to be like, bro...  I was exhausted by that point.  We were all hanging around in the bar.  See, now, what was your plan of attack?  You wanted to bring, like, a joint? 
[03:17:30]  See, that's too much commitment, because now you've got to stand around and smoke it.  No, we just put it out.  But to Troy, like, you know, the night starts at 1 a.m.  To me, I'm like, no, I think it's time for bed.  Well, I was going to get you high before the wedding.  Maybe.  I was going to get you high before the wedding.  And then if you get stoned at the reception, then it's like, then you won't talk to anybody,  and then you're all fucked up and paranoid, because everybody's looking at you because  you're stoned.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then we'd be like, oh, oh, these...  I thought they looked at me because I'm good looking.  Well, no, I was trying to get you stoned afterwards.  Damn.  Yeah, not so much after this gravy.  It's a W. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, it is a W.  Oh, God.  A W comes up at the middle of the belly button and then back down again on each side.  Oh, my God.  A W is worse than a U.  Is it?  Oh, it's got to be bad, right?  A W.  It's like rippling.  Oh, that's great.  Are you going to Roger Waters?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got a connection.  I think I'm going to fucking text me, or guess what?  No more connections.  Why don't you send a nice email?  Hey, why don't you keep friends?  I put the word out, so she fucking better do it right there.  Did you wait until I get my Yankee tickets before you blow that up? 
[03:18:30]  I'm going to go to Gathering of the Vibes and see Primus.  Damn.  Gathering of the Juggalos.  Next Friday.  Next Friday.  I think I'm going, too.  Yeah, I'll be there.  I'll bring some killer shit.  That's it.  We probably are ready.  We're in the same seats.  You have a limited time to do this, because you're not going to want to fuss around with  that stuff with a newborn in the house.  Yeah.  There's the perfect opportunity.  See, you've got a window.  Fucking Roger Waters.  You want to be in the zone, so I better do it before Sunday.  Do you miss having a newborn now that you have a two-year-old? 
[03:19:00]  Huh?  Sunday.  Do you miss having a newborn now that you have a two-year-old?  No.  So are you ready for another one?  Oh, man.  I hate to do it all over again.  That's the part I can't get.  I hate the fact that you've got to start over.  Like, you just got done.  Because you're building this thing.  You're building this thing, and then all of a sudden, no reset.  It's a reset.  It's like starting a video game all over again.  Fuck that.  You're prestiging.  You're prestiging for your kid.  Yes!  You have to prestige at your kid.  But you have no idea.  You get through all these stages. 
[03:19:30]  Some of them are tough, and some are enjoyable.  I have an idea from Call of Duty.  Yeah, and then all of a sudden, you have to start over?  Yeah, it sucks.  Handing all your weapons.  It kind of sucks.  Start with that shitty gun again.  I got to the point where we actually communicate.  Now we've got to go back to the point where the kid smiles, not because it knows anything.  It smiles because it's a nature thing to make you love it and feed it.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  They try to look cute?  They do that on purpose.  That's hilarious.  Or you just be like, throw it away.  Throw it away.  The smile connected to you means nothing for a really long time. 
[03:20:00]  It's just nature's way of making you think that the kid is aware, but it's more so you  will nurture it.  Take care of it.  Not push it out of the nest.  And you've got to keep building this one while you start the other one from scratch.  Oh, man.  Yeah, you can't screw up this one.  No shit.  Got your foundation built.  Yeah.  That's a lot to get done.  Yeah.  You're still putting floors on this one.  It's like playing SimCity.  Two games at one time.  Yep.  One in the beginning and one where you've got everything to go.  Except with people's lives.  Trying to put the fires out.  It's real life Sims. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Real life Sims.  You could put them in a room and take the door away if you want.  Build a serial killer.  Oh, that would just be my favorite part.  Oh, it was great.  But all those Sims skeletons used to creep me out after a while.  Yeah, they're walking around the house all along.  First, they used to piss themselves, and then they would just turn into a ghost.  And they would sit there and cry.  And then, boom, Tombstone.  Yeah.  Backyard.  Yep.  I gotta go.  All right.  Everybody have a great weekend.  Someday, Troy.  Someday.  Stay tuned for the after show where we'll talk about more Sims games. 
[03:21:00]  There's no chance.  Especially SimAnt and SimFarm taking your calls.  Thanks, guys, for all the nice tweets.  I really appreciate it.  And see you Monday.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Sirius XM. </pre>
