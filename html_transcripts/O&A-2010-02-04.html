<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts boasting about their radio show's success and dominance.  They segued into a discussion about the perceived decline in quality of Super Bowl commercials, blaming increased societal sensitivity and budgetary constraints.  Opie blamed his dry eyes on excessive mobile gaming, specifically citing Paper Toss and Bust-a-Move.  This led to listener calls about their favorite Super Bowl commercials, with callers often referencing older, more provocative ads like the Terry Tate Office Linebacker commercial.  The mystery of why Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy weren't following each other on Twitter was addressed, revealed as a deliberate tactic to maintain fresh, unscripted on-air content.

The show then tackled the subject of online "haters" who criticized the show despite its popularity.  A substantial portion focused on the frustrations of being forced to watch movies and television shows chosen by significant others.  Opie shared his agonizing experiences enduring chick flicks like "The Love Letter" and "Bridges of Madison County," highlighting the power imbalance in such situations. The discussion returned to Super Bowl commercials and listener calls, interspersed with the hosts' reactions to an unexpectedly appearing image of Jack Nicholson's daughter on their computer screen. The segment concluded with a brief mention of plans for a new recurring segment featuring Ian Halpern.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We still love doing radio, by the way.  Love it!  You've heard of here, folks.  Don't I like about our show? It's fun and safe at the same time.  We're popular! 
[00:00:30]  See, we rule on the radio.  We have a good 40 minutes, an average 120, an hour of filler, and an hour of dread.  What the fuck is going on?  I'm Stereo Hector.  And you, I don't go to your job.  It's the gold addict that you work with.  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be starstruck.  Bum-ba-da-bam!  Who gives a shit?  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, morning. 
[00:01:00]  Hi, everybody.  On the way in, they were doing something on the Super Bowl.  When I say on the way in, they were doing, you know, me and Aunt, well, we drive in separately,  whatever, but we both listen to the same news station.  Same news, yeah.  And they're like, let's face it.  The only reason we watch the Super Bowl is for the commercials. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, really?  And at that moment, I was thinking to myself, when was the last time we cared about a Super  Bowl commercial?  Yeah, they, like, can you name one Super Bowl commercial from last year?  No.  And, I mean, if you go back to when it was really amazing, the Super Bowl commercials, you  do remember all those commercials.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's because they had to tame everything down and get any sexuality or surprises or something,  even the least bit controversial that makes you remember these things.  They had to pull all those out because people get offended. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And by people, I mean person.  And, um, my eye is killing me.  Sorry.  My eyes are itching and my nose is burning.  My eyes are so fucking dry.  I think they're pumping some kind of fucking Zyklon B into the studio.  Dude, my eye hurts so much.  It's just dry that I forgot what I was trying to tell you.  Maybe you have chronic dry eye.  I'm going to write you a prescription for restaceous.  I'll tell you what it is.  I finally got a MacBook. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, Pro Mac Pro or whatever.  Mac Pro book of death.  I don't know.  The Mac Daddy of Mac.  I was telling you this yesterday and then I'll get back to that Super Bowl thing.  I know why my eyes are dry.  I was telling Anthony, with all these great video games out there, you know, I mean, name  your favorite game to yourself right now with the amazing graphics and the amazing gameplay.  And it's like, holy shit, look at what I could do now in gaming.  It's always that simple, dumb game that gets me.  I do paper toss on my iPhone.  That's the only thing I do with the iPhone. 
[00:03:00]  Paper toss.  It's a paper weight and I play paper toss with it.  It's this miraculous piece of electronics and you're playing paper toss.  And secretly, I know that the iPhone is better than the BlackBerry.  Secretly, I know that.  Publicly, well, I just announced that.  But publicly, I'm rah-rah about the BlackBerry.  Of course.  But I know deep down that the iPhone's better than the BlackBerry.  I really do.  But I don't feel like getting into it and dealing with it.  So I got an iPhone.  But my brother-in-law had the paper toss or a paper basket, whatever the fuck. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You throw the paper into the basket.  And he turned me on to it while we were watching Football Down in Philly one Sunday.  And I'm hooked.  And I go, wow, I got that iPhone.  So I fucking have the game and that's all I do with it.  Instead of this great gaming I could be doing on the PS3 or the Xbox.  Of course, yeah.  Or I have a pretty good computer, too, with a huge TV screen as my monitor.  I could be playing cool games on there.  And you're using a virtual rolled-up piece of paper, throwing it into a garbage pile. 
[00:04:00]  Well, that's one of my better primitive games.  Oh.  Because I also do Brick Breaker on the BlackBerry.  Brick Breaker, yeah.  Which is way better than any video game I can get from my PS3.  And now, because I got the Mac, the MacBook, that dumb bubble game.  Oh, I haven't played that one.  It's a bunch of colored dots.  Yeah.  And you've got to get three in a row.  Colored is very archaic.  Yeah.  And you move your shooter and you shoot it up. 
[00:04:30]  It's kind of...  So it's like Space Invader.  I don't know what the name of the game is.  I think you're talking about Bust a Move.  Is that what it's called?  They might call it something different.  I'm not really sure.  Bust a Move.  It's probably just the same game with a different title.  So I play that at hours at a time.  So now I've got a left eye that's twitching.  And my right eye is dry.  It's dry and burning when you blink.  Because you have to kind of like really focus.  Because the games are on these tiny little screens.  Because even though they can make the game on the entire monitor for the MacBook, 
[00:05:00]  it's in a little square.  It's a little box.  It's a little box.  Yeah.  So that's why the dry eyes.  Yeah, that's what I play.  There it is.  Yep.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, okay.  Yeah, sort of.  I play a version of that.  Yeah, that's the one.  Yeah, I like, as far as the iPhone games go,  I like the shuffleboard bowling.  That's a good one.  And these are, I call them shitter games.  Right.  Because when you're sitting on the shitter, you could play a game. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Who knew technology would bring us to the point where when you're taking a dump,  you could play just fun little games.  And then there's the ragdoll stick figure one.  I like that one.  You fling ragdoll people onto various contraptions to make them fall into certain holes and shit.  And they got like pretty good ragdoll physics for these little stick figures.  That's a fun one.  Oh, Snood rules.  Snood?  I love Snood, which is another version of that. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  But it comes down to my point.  You could be rocking some great video games on your giant screen TV with the Xbox or the PS3.  It's a ridiculous computing power at the house.  And it still comes down to that basic stupid little game that is very easy to make.  There's no real graphics to it.  I'm just going to sit on my couch and destroy my eyes.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Someone is saying, it's Carolina Man writes, check out Roto-V eyedrops. 
[00:06:30]  Anyone know about these things?  They're over the counter.  Dwayne Reed, they're like Red Bull for your eyeballs.  So great.  You know, nothing could be, it can't be good if you're just pouring shit into your eyes  because they hurt because you're doing something.  Yeah.  Like, it's better to stop or, you know, cut back on what you're doing that makes your  eyes hurt than pour some kind of shit into your eyeballs all the time.  There's a guy in the line, Allen in Virginia.  He's like, there's a way to make your screen bigger when you play Bust a Move. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  I don't want to know.  Because I couldn't play yesterday because my eye hurts so much.  I think it's one of the control buttons or something and then you scroll.  I'm sure.  You scroll your little mousey thing.  Yeah, just move it.  And the whole screen gets bigger.  Yeah, I get it.  I understand I probably can make it bigger, but I'd rather not because I couldn't play  yesterday because my eye is killing me.  The Super Bowl.  Okay, this is what I was going to say.  So last year with the commercials, I remember trying to figure out when the cool commercials  started and I wasn't able to figure it out. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, wow, like when they started?  Well, they do a pregame and then, you know, the kickoff and the first commercial.  But you don't, it all blended together.  Remember when, way back when it was a big deal about Super Bowl commercials, you knew  when, okay, here it is, boom, Bud Bowl or whatever the fuck it would be.  Bud Bowl.  You just knew this was the first commercial break with all these great commercials.  Yeah.  I remember last year, I didn't know where it started because they were all kind of cool 
[00:08:00]  commercials in the pregame and stuff.  And I think they even cheated and played some of the big commercials in the pregame as well.  Yeah, I think also economically they were really having a hard time, so they kind of pulled  back last year.  Is that what it was?  Yeah, so they weren't really making memorable commercials and spending a fuckload of money  and things like that.  Because of the economy and how everything collapsed last year.  Companies were all broke and shit.  You know, that's a good theory.  Baroque.  That's a good theory on it.  Yeah, this year I think they're coming back a little though.  But again, you're not going to find any of those really surprising or funny because they're 
[00:08:30]  irreverent commercials because, you know, the NFL, they don't want those kind of shenanigans  in their product.  No, of course not.  Although they did the right thing and they did not fine Rex Ryan.  Well, they said because the Jets organization did that they're going to leave him alone.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, but then if that's the case, then the NFL kind of strong-armed the Jets organization.  Exactly.  You, I mean, how many times have we heard this? 
[00:09:00]  You take care of the problem or we will.  You handle it internally or else we'll step in.  Uh-huh.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, the Bud Frogs.  Remember the Bud Frogs?  Yeah.  That was like 1995, that shit.  Don't even say that.  And then, of course, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  I saw recently a YouTube video.  Somebody made a goof using the What's Up guys.  I can only imagine. 
[00:09:30]  I can only imagine.  Somebody was making a phone call trying to get through to somebody and they got the  What's Up guys.  What's up?  What's up?  You know, you look back now and go, all right, that was kind of lame, but when you first saw  that shit, that was fucking funny, man.  Wow, it was good for the time.  What's up?  But I don't really remember any great Super Bowl commercials in the last few years.  No.  I really just, I just can't name any.  Not memorable.  There were the Doritos ones with that hot chick. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  What the hell was her name?  Allie or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Her last name Allie or Ollie or something like that.  Yeah, where she's in the fucking laundromat.  She was fucking smoking hot for like two years and then she went away.  Fell off the face of the earth.  And that was it for her.  Maybe she hit the wall.  Yeah.  Hit the wall.  Yeah, you know.  Like a chick does.  She was probably in her 30s to begin with, so she was like, she was on borrowed time.  Closer to the wall than we've all thought.  She was on borrowed time. 
[00:10:30]  Last night, I was telling Anthony.  Nanner Puss.  Denny's Nanner Puss.  Well, the Nanner Puss is, you know, just terrific.  Who doesn't like it?  That was one of last year's Super Bowl commercials.  That was a Super Bowl commercial?  Yeah, apparently.  I don't remember it as a Super Bowl commercial.  I remember we did a whole fucking thing on it.  Well, Travis does the whole thing.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Nanner Puss.  Travis does a terrific Nanner Puss dance.  People want to talk about the Super Bowl commercials, I guess?  It was just a quick, dumb observation because they were talking about it on the way in. 
[00:11:00]  Let's face it, the only reason we watch.  But it's like, nah, no.  Years ago, it was like a big thing, but now, man, it gets a shit.  Are you having a Super Bowl party?  Yeah.  You want to come?  You're cordially invited.  Did I just force you?  No.  See, I told you they hate each other.  Go fuck yourselves, everyone out there that thinks they know shit.  Go do something else with your fucking time.  They don't follow each other on Twitter.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, that means we hate each other.  Yeah, why?  You know, I got a great explanation why I don't follow Anthony and Jimmy on Twitter, but I'm  not going to fucking explain it to you, assholes.  Trust me, and I and Jimmy get along just fine.  That's hysterical.  Just these dopes that think they know shit.  That following people on Twitter is the, I guess, benchmark as to whether you enjoy someone's  company or you're friendly.  I'll give you this little tidbit.  Surprisingly, I check Anthony's Twitter all the time. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  But there's a reason why I don't follow them.  Yeah.  And it's very logical, you fucking dopes.  God, enough with trying to rip the damn show apart.  And it's so obvious the show is going very well.  Well, we're pumping out great shows, and then these supposed fan sites have to continue  to try to, you know, tear the whole fucking thing down.  Enough already.  You know what else?  It's like we share enough of the listeners, you know, they follow you and me, that if you 
[00:12:30]  post something, a lot of people retweet it, and I get to it.  If it's important, if it's something like that, you know, something I want to see or  stuff, then I'll see it.  I'll see it.  I know.  I'm not going to explain it.  I'm not going to fucking, you know, explain it to these idiots.  If you were smart enough, you'd be able to figure it out.  You'd be able to actually figure it out.  You'd be able to figure it out on your own instead of thinking that there's this underlying  fucking, oh, they fucking hate each other. 
[00:13:00]  Figure out the logical reason why we wouldn't.  See if anyone's smart enough to figure out a logical reason why we wouldn't follow each  other, the three of us, you know.  Jimmy, you, and me.  Why it's in our best interest.  Yeah, let's do that.  I just got to.  You fucking dummy.  There you go.  Oops.  Oops.  I just hate to have to do that.  There's one.  Right there.  Very good. 
[00:13:30]  What?  Someone figured out right away?  I got it.  I just looked down.  Bam.  There it was.  It's so logical.  But, you know, they don't want to know the real answer.  They want to try to tear the fucking show apart.  Yeah.  That's what they want to do.  And what bothers me is it's on supposed fan sites.  And that's why I don't understand.  I don't understand it.  Fan sites.  Are there any of those out there?  I said supposed fan sites.  Are there any of those?  No, because some of these websites, yeah, they do have a lot of fans. 
[00:14:00]  And they are doing the right thing.  But a lot of these places have been infested with fucking haters that are not fans of the show.  As much as they say, no, I really am, but you're not.  And like Jimmy has often said, it's the same assholes that if you're out, they'll come up to you and smile and shake your hand and stuff.  And then they'll be online somewhere on some fucking hate board just bashing the shit out of you and the show.  Yeah.  No, the show's doing amazingly well right now. 
[00:14:30]  Our numbers are, the numbers they do give us, which are very fucking primitive, are way up from even a year ago.  So we know we're fucking doing our jobs and everything is going well.  But, you know, you go to some of these sites, you would think it's a different fucking story.  Let's say hi to Corey in Atlanta.  Corey.  Hi, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  The greatest Super Bowl commercial was the Terry Tate office linebacker.  Oh, where the guy was like just blindsiding people? 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  Yes, that was the best by far.  Did you ever play blindside when you were growing up?  Oh, yeah, we used to spear each other all the time.  Dude, man, I think of some of the stuff we did just when we were in our 20s.  I can't even imagine anymore.  We used to, like, you know, when you had cake parties out in backyards or in people's houses or at a sorority house or another fraternity house, whatever it would be, at a sporting event.  We did something that was called blindside.  You'd just be sitting there with a beer.  You'd have to be constantly looking all around because someone would just completely take you out blindside. 
[00:15:30]  So you don't even know it's coming.  Yeah, that is good.  Now that we're a bit older, could you imagine taking a blindside hit ant just out of the blue?  No.  How much of a pain in the ass and how horrible that would be?  I'd scream like a baby if I hit my foot on the bedpost or something when I get up in the morning.  Right.  Oh, it's going to leave a bruise.  You'd be sitting there with a red cup full of beer, just mind your own business.  The next thing you know, some animal would just fucking tackle you from behind.  You never saw it coming. 
[00:16:00]  Great, thanks.  Your beer goes flying.  You go flying into the turf.  It's like, no way.  Let's go to Vinny on Long Island.  Vinny.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  What's up?  Morning.  There was a good one from last year.  I believe it was Career Builder.  They had this list of reasons why you hate your job.  Yeah.  And the one guy's boss would stop by and say, hey, dummy.  And the one was out in the car screaming.  And the next guy punches a koala bear. 
[00:16:30]  I forget the exact order of them, but it was pretty funny.  You described it impeccably.  Are we really going to do this?  I'm sitting here thinking.  I know.  I know the listeners are rah-rah.  Let's talk about Super Bowl commercials, but I don't know.  This is the, you open the recipe book, and it says disaster.  All right.  Thank you.  So, one thing that was great about it was for the next couple of weeks, my kids walked  around the house, and they were all, like, mimicking it, because it was, for the most  part, a clean commercial.  Right. 
[00:17:00]  Very good.  He had a nice, at least he had a great tagger on there on the end of that call.  Let me say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, Opie.  Anthony.  I'd like to take a guess at why you guys don't follow each other on Twitter.  Oh.  Yes, sir.  And I'm thinking it's because much of what you guys tweet is also very good for the radio  show.  And if you follow each other and you kind of see it before the show, and then you bring  it to the show, you see that organic, holy shit, surprise moment. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you know something?  I never really thought that that...  There you go.  There you go.  Yes!  End of your dumb discussion on your stupid fucking website.  Wow.  Assholes.  Holy shit.  And finally, somebody maybe with a fucking brain.  And for the people that get it, I appreciate that you get it.  Thank you, Brian.  That's exactly what it is.  Because when I discovered Twitter for everybody, we all know that, last February.  I thought you invented it. 
[00:18:00]  I want to say I invented it.  No, I'm just kidding.  But I did follow Anthony right off the bat.  And then I'm like, then he would be on the show telling this stuff.  And I'm like, I know this.  Right.  So I'm like, you know what, there's a way where I can follow Anthony on Twitter.  I could check out his Twitter, but I don't get updates constantly, ruining a lot of stuff  that we would be talking about organically on a radio show.  There you go.  It took one fucking phone call.  There you go.  I'll twist that around anyway. 
[00:18:30]  Whatever.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Jimmy James.  Morning, Rick.  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to throw my favorite Super Bowl commercial of all time out there.  Yeah.  It was during the old dot-com boom there.  Yeah.  And it was just two white trash guys sitting on lawn chairs in their garage and a chimpanzee  on a crate dancing.  And then it just fades to black and said, we just spent $40 million on this commercial.  What are you doing with your money?  Yeah, that was all right. 
[00:19:00]  Oh.  No, it's all right.  I'm not trying to beat you up, Jimmy James.  I'll just sit here going, that one was fantastic.  I think with the whole PC thing and getting rid of the edge has really messed up the Super  Bowl commercials.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They suck now.  Last years were like any Monday night commercials last year.  But I think Ant nailed it.  I think because the economy sucks so bad, I think they wanted to tone down a lot of the  commercials.  Yeah, yeah.  They wanted to kind of rub it in everyone's faces. 
[00:19:30]  It's like, look, we're failing.  Our stockholders are pissed off.  Yet, we're going to spend millions of dollars on these commercials.  So they did kind of calm it down.  Wow.  She still looks really good.  That's the chick from the Doritos commercial on What Would Tyler Durden Do?  How long ago was that picture?  I don't know if they're on there.  He just sent them to me.  Oh, okay.  Let me see.  Guy listens.  I like this.  That ain't bad.  Why won't he do our show?  They're from July.  Oh.  So quite recent.  I don't know.  Why doesn't he do our show?  He probably has a horrendous radio voice or something. 
[00:20:00]  I don't like to talk to you guys about it.  Yeah.  He's got such a cool website that we all go to, www.tdd.com.  It's really good.  I've asked him a bunch of times.  And he always has the hot girl pictures as he's doing his gossip stories and stuff about  Hollywood and this and that or whatever.  Last time I spoke, he said that he wanted to get his interviewing skills up to power.  But I think Anthony Nellody said...  I don't want to come across like an idiot when I'm talking on the radio. 
[00:20:30]  You got any news on Brad and Jennifer Aniston?  Rumor has it they're texting each other.  They could be together as soon as this summer.  Check my side.  What would Tyler Durden do?  Tyler Durden do?  That's just something like that, man.  Yeah.  He's got to fix his voice up or something.  They're trying to make it a little cheaper.  Hi.  And we've been offered Ian Halpern to do a little regular feature for us.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  By the way, www.tdd.com.  Don't you worry. 
[00:21:00]  You'll get your plugs.  Google it.  Google it.  I think Ian Halpern is going to do kind of a weekly thing for us for a while.  The segment should just be called Google It.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  We're going to talk about a person.  It's Ian Halpern and Google it.  We should have a nice fucking opener for him.  Oh, hell yeah.  A montage of him just saying Google it.  Google it.  You ever see her?  I fucked her.  It was great.  It was great.  It was in Denmark.  I was in Denmark.  And I fucked her there.  No, it's true.  There's pictures.  Google it.  Google it.  That'll be the open for the bit.  Him saying it and you and I doing the Google it. 
[00:21:30]  Google it.  They still want to talk about fucking...  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt and Southam boy.  Matt.  Matt.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Matt.  Hey, man.  Last night, I think on Channel 2, they had the dumbest show my wife made me watch.  It was like the greatest Super Bowl commercials of the past decade.  And apparently you had to call up or go to their friggin' website and vote on them.  And the one that won was some streaking, like a shaved lamb streaking through a football game 
[00:22:00]  from like Water Buffalo and Antelope and shit.  And they had these two slack-jawed cowboys commenting on it.  And that was the one that won greatest commercial of the past 10 years.  You know, I watched that show last night for 30 seconds.  30 seconds was enough.  I fucking couldn't change the channel fast enough.  Yeah.  We're going to be watching all the great Super Bowl commercials from all the past years. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And the way the guy was describing them, I mean, he couldn't have been more of a tool.  And then they'd have like, you know, the eye candy going to like the football players,  the comment on them.  And they would all be like, oh, yeah, I like that one.  And then Ray Rice was on there.  And he'd be like, hey, little, little, Ray Rice up the middle for a touchdown.  And it was just the dumbest show ever.  What did you want to watch last night, but you were forced to watch that?  I wanted to play PS3.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There it is.  He didn't want to watch that shit.  You've got to get a second TV, my friend. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, well.  There's nothing wrong with.  I can't play it on the 27-inch in the other room.  I've got to play it on the 46.  So, you know, my wife wants to sit in the living room and watch TV on the 46 for an hour.  And I can't, like, wait until that shit's over fast enough.  Sure.  And then I get to play it 10.  Sorry about that, brother.  Hey, when you were married, did you have to, like, sit down and watch programs that you didn't want to watch?  Oh.  You did, right?  Oh, yes.  Nightly basis.  Just sitting there going, oh, God, this show sucks. 
[00:23:30]  I wish I could remember some of the shows, but I've pretty much tried to block that entire chunk of time out of my head.  Yeah.  And I'm doing a pert good job.  Sure you are.  But I do remember sitting there going, like, God damn it, man.  I don't want to be watching this.  And then, God forbid, I got on the computer to play, like, Half-Life.  Yeah.  Uh, what are you doing?  Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna, you know, play, um, Half-Life for a little bit.  A little bit. 
[00:24:00]  All right, well, I guess I'll see you at three in the morning.  Oh, in case, you know, comes, I'll come and sit down and watch this lousy fucking show with you.  Just to not make any waves, not have an argument, and be able to just sit and fucking, why do you, ugh.  There are shows that are made for women.  There are shows that are made for men.  And then, yeah.  And, yeah, and there are shows for both.  Yeah.  But when it comes down to having to sit there on the couch because your woman likes a particular show, what is that about? 
[00:24:30]  Making you sit there.  You're not having, like, special time together or anything.  Yeah.  It's not, like, quality time.  You're just sitting and watching a stupid show.  And the thought that I couldn't just go over, which, by the way, my computer was ten feet away from the couch.  And I could see the TV and everything.  I'm in the same room and everything.  But just that, I don't know, I guess it's a power thing with some couples.  Right.  Where the wife does not want the husband doing something just for the fuck of not letting him do it with no reason to back it up. 
[00:25:00]  You know, I'm lucky so far.  There are times when I'm like, all right, all right, I'm going to go in the other room and, you know, I'm going to watch whatever, whatever I want to watch.  Yeah.  And she'll do the same thing, too.  I'll be watching the island there.  She goes, you know what, I got some shows that I taped in the other room.  I'm like, all right.  And isn't that fine?  And then I'm like, you know what, I'll go, I'll check in on you in a little bit. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  She goes, all right, cool.  And then in between periods, you go in there and we'll just fucking talk, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, well, second period's about to start.  I'll see you in a little bit.  You're like, whoa, gotta go.  I'm lucky that way.  Yeah.  My ex, I wasn't lucky.  I think we had to fucking sit down and watch some shit.  But I think that comes down to economics, too.  Because back then, I only had one TV.  So it was like, fuck, now I'm stuck watching.  I don't remember what the horse shit shows were back then, but I was stuck watching.  Two TVs?  He's just joking. 
[00:26:00]  Nobody has two TVs.  Nobody has two TVs.  So I think it comes down to that, too, you know?  Yeah.  Although I think most people have two TVs in their house at this point.  Oh, fuck, come on.  But it's just like doing anything, like wanting to sit and play a computer game.  And it just turns into this, like, yeah, you know something?  What if I do just come staggering up to bed at three in the morning?  Considering, especially, I didn't have to be to work until three in the afternoon. 
[00:26:30]  Mm-hmm.  So why the fuck wouldn't I just play a video game until three in the morning?  Who gives a shit?  Like, who would give that big a shit that I'm enjoying myself, that's what I'm doing, just, you know, let me do it?  Why this power play thing?  Yeah, what business is it to you?  And it's had, yeah, it's had a lingering effect on how I do things when I do have, you know, company over the house or something.  Because sometimes it's like, you know, yeah, I'm going to go inside. 
[00:27:00]  I've got to check some shit in my office on that computer because that's a Windows.  Or I'll just flip open the laptop, start playing a little poker.  But I'm still sitting on the couch watching TV, whatever.  And I'm thinking in my head, oh, boy, there's going to be trouble.  Oh, my God, there's going to be a fight.  Oh, my God, should I even grab the computer?  I mean, well, it's no problem.  No fucking problem.  Right.  But it's been ingrained in me, like, over years, just, you know, put it down.  No.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Why?  Why?  Our new thing is, you know, I got a laptop, she's got a laptop. 
[00:27:30]  We just sit in bed on our laptops.  Oh, yeah.  It's the greatest thing ever.  Yeah.  We forget that we're next to each other after a while.  You're just sending each other fucking messages online.  Hey, what are you doing?  Sitting right next to each other.  What are you doing?  Texting and IMing.  What are you wearing?  Fucking, all right.  Let's go to Phil in North Carolina.  Phil.  Phil.  Hi.  Hi, fella.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you, Phil.  Oh, screener tells him to say that. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Right from way back.  Linger and Linger.  You were talking about the commercials in the Super Bowl, and the company's not spending  as much money.  I heard last night that the Census Bureau is spending some ungodly amount of money for  a 30-second commercial in the Super Bowl, the most expensive place to advertise.  The Census.  It's about wasting money.  Yeah.  The Census Bureau reminding you to fill out your forms.  Yeah.  They're very concerned.  They want us all to fill out our forms, Anthony.  They're really like into this. 
[00:28:30]  They really want us to, holy, mother of God, who's that?  That's Nicholson's, Jack Nicholson's daughter?  Wow.  Where's that?  Look how easily, with the train, leaves the tracks when a hot girl is on Danny's monitor.  Hey, you're only human.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  She's a blonde.  She's not that old.  No.  She can't be more, I was going to say that she's less than 20.  All right.  Holy shit. 
[00:29:00]  She's in a little bikini.  Big thingy going on there.  Blonde hair.  Looking good.  Sort of has the Jack Nicholson eyes a little bit, which makes it a little creepy.  Crazy eyes.  I got a great Jack Nicholson thing for you in a minute or two.  Actually, after the break, Larry King had the Avatar people on.  Yeah, yeah.  And I already told Anthony.  See, if he would have fucking followed me on Twitter, then it would have been a problem.  Anything else, Phil?  She's cute.  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate that.  I don't know why they're so concerned that we fill out our forms this time around. 
[00:29:30]  Let's go to Joey on Long Island.  Joey.  Hey, yeah.  What's up, boys?  What's up?  My asshole wife guilts me into watching American Idol, and she uses the excuse of, oh, don't  you think we should watch it as a family?  You know, your daughter really wants to watch American Idol, and I got to fucking sit through  that horse shit just sucks.  You know, yeah, just being forced to do something just because you're married or in a relationship 
[00:30:00]  or whatever the fuck it is, is beyond me.  Because I, it would never bother me if you're with somebody and living with them, whatever,  relationship, and that girl decides, like, hey, um, I got something to do or I want to  do this.  I, it wouldn't faze me to say, no, you sit here with me and we're doing this together.  And so, where the fuck did that come from? 
[00:30:30]  Exactly.  Did you have, ah, what's that?  It's a little phone noises.  Blink, blink, blink.  Did I turn mine now?  Um.  I, I, I, sometimes, there we go.  And Ann, you, you, you used to have to do the, uh, thank you, Joey, uh, the, the chick  flick movie, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't have to do that shit anymore, either.  I saw.  There's times it's like, my, my, my girl, uh, uh, uh, Julie, Julia, I'm like, no.  Oh, no.  She goes, all right, calls a friend up, and they go and see Julie, Julia. 
[00:31:00]  That's it.  That's the way it should work.  That's how it should be.  Nice and easy.  There was no reason.  Instead of some kind of guilt trip because you're not fucking, uh, going to the chick flick with  her.  No reason I should have had to have seen The Love Letter.  None!  Yeah.  That was so utterly bad.  The Love Letter?  Uh, it was called The Love Letter, wasn't it?  Was it The Letter?  Kevin Costner?  No.  Who the fuck was in that one?  What the fuck is The Love Letter?  It was so bad. 
[00:31:30]  So goddamn bad.  Uh, The Love Letter.  The Love Letter?  Let's see who was in that.  Uh, yeah, 1999, that would be the year.  That would be it.  That was a, that was a hell of a year, 99.  That was part of Hans Stark.  For old land.  No, that was the beginning of seeing the light.  Oh, really?  1999 was a good year for Anthony.  You were getting out of your blue period?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Who the fuck starred in The Love Letter?  Oh, God. 
[00:32:00]  It's, um, Kate Capshaw, Blythe Danner, Ellen DeGeneres, Julianne Nicholson, Tom Everett Scott, Tom Selleck, Gloria Stewart.  This was a tremendous hunk of shit.  And, uh, the synopsis is great.  Let's hear the synopsis.  And this I had to sit through.  Anthony didn't have a choice.  It was either this or, um, an entire couple of days of real, uh, evilness. 
[00:32:30]  Uh, the power of words and images to open hearts.  Helen runs, uh, miles a day to burn off energy.  She's an emotional celibate.  Going through the post at her shop, she finds a romantic and poetic letter between the couch cushions, unsigned, and thinks it's for her. 
[00:33:00]  It melts her resistance to feeling.  And soon, she undertakes an affair with Johnny, a collegiate employee.  He sees the letter and thinks she wrote it to him.  He quotes some of it, so she thinks he wrote it to her.  In the background are Helen's longtime friend, uh, longtime friend George, who loves her.  And her mother, who abruptly left on a long trip months before.  You know. 
[00:33:30]  You know.  Exactly.  You know, you would, you would have done the same to me, so.  You would have done the same to me.  That was a mercy Mike killing.  Yes, it was.  A mercy Mike killing.  There is, you can't read the synopsis.  As you're reading that, this is what I really heard in my, my brain.  Yeah.  You lost me after the first, I don't know, five or six words. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, Janine has a great line.  She goes, wow, that just gave me my period.  Ah, fuck.  Ah, that's classic.  It is.  That was so bad.  Boring as shit.  The attempts at that, you know, romantic comedy humor in there with Ellen DeGeneres and stuff.  And you were forced into it?  I sat there like, like fucking a zombie.  But you were forced to go.  Completely.  I would never want to see that movie. 
[00:34:30]  Did your ex ever go to a movie by herself?  Was it rare?  I don't recall that.  I would usually have to.  So you would have to go.  Go to the movie.  What would, what would her logic be?  Because it was like a movie night, you know.  What would her logic be?  You know, some of these movies, they're kind of made for chicks.  But you read the synopsis and go, you know what?  Ah, I'll go.  You're not excited, but you're like, you know what?  I'll go.  So, but at least you have the, you can make your own decision about it. 
[00:35:00]  Not where there's this guilt trip where you, next thing you know, you're going to a movie.  You have no desire to see whatsoever.  You know what?  Pick, pick, let me see movies that were out in like 98, 97, 98.  Well, one of them I think we both suffered through was that fucking Bridges of Madison County.  Bridges of Madison County.  That was a fucking movie I was forced to go to.  Can I keep my film in your refrigerator?  Wow, what an exciting part when he actually put his film in her fridge. 
[00:35:30]  What are you doing up here?  I'm taking pictures of the Bridges of Madison County.  Doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly. </pre>
