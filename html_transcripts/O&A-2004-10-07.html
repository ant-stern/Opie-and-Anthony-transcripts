<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with significant technical difficulties, specifically an echo in Jim Norton's headphones, causing frustration and humorous banter with engineer Jaime.  Several staff members were present: Jim Norton, Big Kev, Ben, Sex Bagel, Steve from FoundryMusic.com, and Master Poe (security).  A major conflict erupted between Ben, playing energizing music, and a man from "Frank's Place" who repeatedly demanded the music be turned down, escalating to near-physical confrontation.  Opie and Anthony attributed this to jealousy over their show's success and growing influence within XM,  leading to discussions about their plans for expanded studio space.

The show then veered into numerous tangents: their sleep schedule adjustment; graphic details of Jim Norton's bowel habits;  baseball discussions (Yankees, Red Sox, Angels); and rants against visors, one-word artists, and hot air balloonists.  A trucker caller provided humorous anecdotes about life on the road and the prevalence of gay men in truck stops, prompting further discussions and stories from Opie, Anthony, and Steve.  This discussion continued into another segment, focusing on the use of CB radios by gay truckers, contrasting it with the sometimes violent experiences of other truckers.  Female trucker Wendy called in to comment on the show's "homoerotic material."  Explicit discussions of Jimmy's sexual activities and spending, including detailed accounts of paid encounters, followed.  Caller Gary mentioned promoting the show among truckers.

A humorous song was played, transitioning to a recollection of their past excessive drinking and partying during commercial breaks, including having a bar and shot girls in the studio.  They compared their move to XM to Sirius, emphasizing the lack of commercial interruptions and discussing their popularity and potential rivalry with Howard Stern, speculating on the timing of Stern's satellite radio announcement.  They also talked about their previous Infinity Broadcasting contract and financial compensation for their two-year absence. Listener calls, some containing offensive language and racial slurs, were interspersed throughout.  They discussed "The Big Smoke" event and a producer's experience waiting for a picture with a superimposed nude woman.  The conversation continued to meander through anecdotes on sex, money, and the radio industry.

The show then highlighted their newfound freedom on XM, contrasting it with terrestrial radio censorship.  They discussed playing uncensored song parodies by Anthony's brother, Brother Joe, and the increased creative freedom. Opie launched into a racist rant about white blues musicians.  A significant portion focused on their "Wow" promotion (women flashing breasts to drivers with "Wow" stickers), its consequences, and popularity.  They recounted encounters with celebrities, some questionable, and a potential job applicant called boasting about reckless driving and criminal history. A humorous segment on difficult packaging followed, leading into anticipation for Brother Joe's uncensored parodies.  Brother Joe was mentioned as an upcoming guest.


Listener calls and in-studio banter dominated a further segment. A caller described a cannibalistic dream; Alisa from Washington D.C. professed her love and offered a breast picture, leading to a nipple preference discussion.  Recurring technical difficulties, blamed on Jaime, plagued the phone system.  A caller inquired about Opie's impression-based drinking game; Rob from Maine asked about proper wiping techniques; Andrew from Queens referenced pranks on Howard Stern's show, involving Brother Joe’s music.  Discussions about their relationship with Don Imus, including Imus's calls and opinions, were included.  Baseball discussions, specifically the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, featured vulgar comments and racial slurs.  The final segment played Brother Joe's song parodies ("Dry Vagina," an Olsen Twins song, a James Taylor/DMX mashup, a SARS song, and "A Cunt"), warning listeners about offensive content. Opie’s sister briefly joined the show.

A highly vulgar and sexually explicit segment followed, centering on a song with repeated use of the c-word and listener calls.  The hosts played a song from a past "world's most offensive song contest," sparking discussion about FCC complaints and the show's controversial nature.  Listeners requested offensive segments (like the sexually explicit "Money Snatch" game) be repeated.  The "Money Snatch" game was described in detail.  Discussions included an upcoming challenge from a rival talk show host, their move to satellite radio and its media coverage, the cancellation of "Last Comic Standing" (focusing on producer Jay Moore and contestant Rich Voss), and casual, crude conversations about sex.  A cooking segment featuring acorn squash was included.  The broadcast concluded with sexually explicit remarks and XM promotional announcements.

[00:06:30]  The nerve of these people to actually have it as a setup.  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  Die.  Die.  The U.P. and Anthony Show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  That's right.  That's right.  And welcome to the U.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:07:00]  Wunderbar.  What a glorious, glorious day.  What, you got a problem right off the bat, Jim Norton?  Echo.  Jimmy's got the echo?  You shouldn't have an echo.  I got all the buttons right, man.  We got Jaime in the house today, and he's taking care of everything. 
[00:07:30]  I have no delay.  This is going to be the best show of the week.  Well, I have a delay.  I can see your lips moving and nothing calming until 30 seconds.  It's like watching Britney Spears live.  How do you have a delay in your headphones and everyone else is fine?  I don't know, but this is creeping me out.  That is odd.  All right, we'll get that taken care of.  Here comes Jaime.  A second.  I'm sure it's just a quick push of the button.  Wait, Jaime, I'm going to try to figure this out.  Uh-oh.  Go ahead, O.  Oh, no.  No, I can't.  Don't let me do it. 
[00:08:00]  I can't figure it out.  You really have an echo on your headphones?  I would never disturb the opening of the show to make that up.  No, that ain't going to do it.  That's not it.  Now I have echo.  See?  Oh, this is great to try this out on the show.  Now we have none.  Wow.  Now I have no headphones whatsoever.  I'm going to kill you.  I feel like I'm talking into the vagina of a fat girl.  You still got the echo there, Jimmy?  Yeah.  We were so excited that everything was going to be taken care of today.  How can you have echo? 
[00:08:30]  I don't know, but I do.  Stop.  You're fine, right, Ant?  Yeah.  I'm fine.  I have no echo here.  Jaime, you're fine when you put those headphones on?  I got echo.  You got echo, too?  Yeah.  Jaime, I seem to be hooked up to the outside system as opposed to this system.  Oh, my God.  Well, just take your headphones off because we've got a busy show.  He'll figure it out during the break or something.  All right.  Maybe we could just have that guy come in and tell me what you just said.  Well, that's what we want to talk about.  We want to talk about a lot of things today.  Is the sound on out there? 
[00:09:00]  All right.  What do you want me to do, Jaime?  No, he disconnected it.  Oh.  This is all over the nation right now.  Oh, my God.  He's going to the computer, Anthony.  We're national.  This is a national radio show.  See?  I mean, we have the audience of a college radio station, but the fact is we're being  heard all over the country.  We realize the tech here has just gone too far.  It's gone well past the point of being convenient, handy, and user-friendly.  That's it.  Oh, you got it?  That's it.  We're all set? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, my God.  If tomorrow when Jaime's not here and Norton has an echo in his headphones...  You'll never figure that out.  You had to see what he just did.  What did Jaime do?  I have no idea, man.  It looked like he just launched a missile from this computer.  He did it with a mouse.  Hey, is there anyone going to get the sound on out there?  Because we keep going in and out.  We can't hear anything.  Yeah, we got problems, man.  I don't know what it is about the Opie and Anthony show, but we end up having problems  wherever we go.  We make friends.  We don't make friends.  That's the problem.  I know.  I think there's a lot of jealous people that are around here. 
[00:10:00]  We haven't built a coalition, Opie, is what it is.  We go in to a place unilaterally and without a coalition of the willing.  Right.  And we just kind of step on.  Oh, Ben just bashed his head into the TV monitor.  Ben just bashed his Mount Rushmore-sized skull into a television.  And the TV is in worse shape than you are.  We're all so giddy today.  Wow.  Well, all right.  Let's start.  So we come in and people now are a little upset.  Yeah, let's start from the beginning. 
[00:10:30]  We get here about 4.30 because we're trying to put on an entertaining, funny radio show.  We're taking this new venture very, very seriously, this satellite radio thing.  And it looks like other people are now taking it seriously as well.  Coming on board.  And so we get here at 4.30.  At 5 o'clock on our channel, High Voltage 202, we start cranking the tunes to get us psyched  for the radio show.  Yes.  Sometimes we...  Custom-made sets.  Yeah, sometimes we have a theme to the hour, and it's fun as the listener to try to figure 
[00:11:00]  out what the theme is.  Right.  Okay?  And we like to crank out the music as we're preparing for the show.  Crank.  Well, the next thing I know, we're all enjoying the music.  There's like 15 people in the New York studios right now all working for the Opie and Anthony  show.  Yeah.  All right?  It's me, Anthony, Jim Norton, Big Kev's here.  You got Ben.  You got Sex Bagel.  You got Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  The Assassin.  And then the Assassin, Master Poe, who's going to have a very busy day, I hear. 
[00:11:30]  Just an array of stars.  And then you got the engineering crew from XM.  Flew up from Washington.  We got so many people trying to figure out all the bugs, you know, because we knew going  into this this week that we were just throwing ourselves out there with the new equipment  and stuff like that.  There's technical glitches that have to be overcome.  So there's literally close to 20 people, I would say, here in New York right now, all for the  Opie and Anthony show.  There's one guy in the office, one, that has nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, this is so uncomfortable, man.  If you are wise, don't listen to me.  Yeah, but here's the deal.  We've got to set the ground rules.  We've been way too nice, okay?  For three days, we've been way too nice.  We've been way too nice.  We have a job to do.  Yes, we do.  A very important job.  We take what we do very seriously, okay?  Exactly. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  So Ben's cranking out the music out in the office area.  He's using someone else's cubicle because they haven't built our office yet, you know?  Yeah.  Because that's part of the problem, too, right, Ben?  Yeah, well, I'm not supposed to be sitting at someone else's desk.  So he's cranking out the music, and then the guy who runs Frank's Place is getting all  pissed off.  Stop whining.  And yells at Ben to turn down the music because this is an office atmosphere.  Quiet.  Well, wait a second.  No, no, no.  I was printing something out. 
[00:13:00]  As soon as I went to the printer, he ran over and turned it down.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Why he comes in at 5 o'clock in the morning, I have no idea.  So wait, you're saying that you were over there at the printer doing some show business.  Right.  And the man kind of got up, half-walked, rolled, ran, whatever he does, over there to turn  the volume of the outside office music down right in front of you?  Yeah.  And then that's when World War III broke out.  Yeah, this is a very small space, okay?  Very small.  Much too small.  And when we get bigger, and that will happen, we are going to take over this whole area, 
[00:13:30]  okay?  These people need to understand that.  We already took over the big studio.  They moved everyone else to that tiny little corner studio.  But these cubicles that they're telling us not to sit in, we're taking over all that  space eventually.  And they need to understand that now, okay?  Oh, gee.  They're building a nice other studio on the other side, like where this studio is being  taken by the Opie and Anthony program and Ben.  They're building another studio over there, which was kind of the same size as the average 
[00:14:00]  water closet.  So if you need to go in there and run a show or take a dump, that's the place to do it.  So, you know, we're getting really pumped.  We've got a very exciting show today, and the music's cranking to get us all psyched.  And you've got the Frank Sinatra guy yelling and screaming at Ben at 5.30 in the morning,  telling him to turn down the music.  It's like our parents are hanging out here or something.  And that was the guy yesterday I said looks like Billy Joel with Down Syndrome.  That's exactly what he looks like.  Picture a guy drooling on Christy Brinkley. 
[00:14:30]  I could see him out the window.  Quite frankly, the guy's being a dick.  He's being a total dick.  There's no reason for him to be here, first of all, at this hour in the morning to program  his music.  He can do that anytime.  When I go out to print stuff out, I'd like to hear the show that we're working on so  I know what's going on.  But now he disconnected the whole stereo after he told me he's going to throw me out the  window.  He threatened to throw you out the window?  Yeah.  Well, that'd be interesting.  See, we're not making friends already.  But we're trying to put on a really entertaining, funny radio show, and there's things we need  to do.  And one of those things is to hear the show throughout the whole floor here. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  I mean, it's a tiny, tiny space.  That's the problem.  There's too many people.  He's the guy that reans it for everybody.  Yeah.  Like everyone's having fun, and there's one killjoy in there that's got to just make  a big fuss about everything.  But who comes in to work at 5.30 in the morning to figure out what Frank Sinatra songs you're  going to play today?  Exactly.  That should be a pretty easy thing to do, anywhere, at any time.  Just throw the record on, sit there for 40 minutes, and then hit stop and put the next  one on, stupid.  Look, Ben, I don't need your crap, okay? 
[00:15:30]  I'd chew people up like you and spit them out.  Just ask Dino.  I think he's getting the whole Frank-like attitude, like he thinks he's Frank.  You think so?  This is my place, toots, all right?  You don't go parading dames around in here or playing your hopped-up music at all hours. 
[00:16:00]  I love how Steve holds up things that he writes down, and he's a football field away from me  through tinted glass with reflections off of it, and he expects me to read it.  Steve?  Oh, are you really?  I didn't realize there was a reflection.  Are you hoping the XM satellite will pick that up and fax it to us?  I didn't realize there was a reflection.  I thought if I wrote it big enough with a Sharpie, you'd see that.  He's, yeah, holding it up from Lebanon.  Thick fingers blocking the words.  Yeah, what were you holding up anyway?  Stop being a pussy and say it.  No, I would have said it, but you keep complaining every time I crack the mic up. 
[00:16:30]  I said the little fella's got to work in the chocolate factory, so he's got to get here  early.  All right.  There you go.  Sorry.  Here's the deal, okay?  Quiet.  Here's the deal.  I know what the problem is.  There's people here that just didn't get the attention that Ant and I are getting.  See, this is the first high-profile show that XM satellite radio has hired.  Yeah.  We need a lot of attention, okay?  Yes, we do.  And they're not too happy that they're not getting the same attention.  You think that's it?  Oh, yeah.  One of our guys, Sex Bagel, heard the Broadway guy and the Frank Sinatra guy, you know, talking 
[00:17:00]  bad about us behind our backs.  That's good, though.  They're like, they can't believe that we're getting all this attention and stuff.  Really?  Well, I don't see the Broadway guy and the Frank Sinatra guy being mentioned in pretty  much every newspaper in America today.  Oh, boy.  Maybe there's reasons why, you know, we need this attention, you idiot.  By the way, it's better those guys don't like you.  If those guys walked in and said, you guys are a hoot, then somebody should put anthrax  in this studio because the show is really starting to suck. 
[00:17:30]  If that's Spaulding Gray's sissy, that Broadway guy really thinks you're hilarious with that  awful do he has on his head, then the show blows.  That was kind of funny when you did it.  What does he use for hair tonic?  Muriatic acid?  No, I think we know what he uses.  The same thing he uses for throat and palate tonic.  It smells like bleach.  Seed gargler?  He's truly a buzzkill, you know?  Yeah, it is a buzzkill.  It's one guy up here that's kind of ruining the mood and the buzz. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, we come in, we got the coffee flowing, the newspapers are being thrown back and forth,  we got the music cranking, we're on the internet, we're getting ready for the show, and this  guy's turning down the freaking music.  And he's just mad because he thinks that Ben is going to fall into the chocolate and spoil  it.  Oh, I want to put a green wig on him and then just rape him with my fist.  So here's the deal. 
[00:18:30]  Our office should be built within the next day or two, then we're going to move this  whole mess to our office, and then eventually as we get more and more subscribers to our  channel, we're going to slowly but surely take over the entire floor, okay?  That's the goal?  That is the reality.  That's the mission that we're on?  Yeah.  That's the reality.  In the first week, we took over the big, huge studio.  We took over the conference room.  So now they can't have little cute conferences anymore because that's our office.  They're building a whole security area for people when they want to come in and hang on 
[00:19:00]  the Opie and Anthony show.  You're rubbing it in, aren't you?  They hired a security guy slash secretary who's pretty much an assigned assassin, Master  Poe.  I think you're rubbing it in to a point, Opie.  I'm not rubbing it in, but you know what?  It's time for a reality check here.  Do the math.  It's not going to get better for you.  It's going to get worse.  Well, do you think the meeting, I'm sure they had important conferences in there.  Hey, I like before when you played that song from Cats. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, when you put on New York, New York, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you're  irrelevant.  It's important for the whole XM Nation to have a Frank's place.  I understand that.  Of course it is.  And a Broadway channel, you know.  But as far as priorities go, you're way, I mean, here, let me get down here.  You're way, way down, down over here.  And that's actually physically the right height for him.  Below the desk, little sissy boy, shut up and hit play.  So really, just leave us alone. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, if you want to get here at 530, that's fine.  Put your headphones on, but you're going to have to deal with our music, and you're going  to have to deal with the 20 people running around trying to get the Opie and Anthony show  on the air, okay?  You need to turn the music down.  Yes, Sex Bagel.  While this is going on, he got up, and he locked himself in the little assembly studio,  and he won't come out.  Wait, are you kidding me?  No, we just were told.  He's sitting in that assembly room, so he can't hear anything you guys are talking about.  That's good, actually.  That's fine.  That's what he should be doing.  Yeah.  Sit in that room, exactly, and do what you got to do, and no one bothers you, you don't  bother no one.  We're all happy. 
[00:20:30]  Why does he come in at 5 o'clock in the morning?  Who would do that?  We have, we're here at 430 trying to get a show, a four-hour talk show done, and he's  got to yell.  It's a lot more complicated than saying in Frank Sinatra records, okay?  We need to be here at 430.  We need our, we need this whole area to prepare.  Trust me.  The entire floor.  The entire floor, yes.  Go home.  Go home.  Just come in at 10.  How great would it be to not be able to come in at 6?  That's what I told him.  If it wasn't a problem, I'll be in at 10.  That's what I would do.  That's just me, guys.  We'll be gone, and then he can run the play. 
[00:21:00]  He would almost have a point if this was, you know, office space with a ton of people  around, you know, trying to do stuff.  There's nobody here.  There's one guy that hates us, and there's 20 guys that are on the O&A camp side.  Members of the team.  He's a scary guy, though.  When he came in before, he said something so quiet that he went, sorry, and he walked  out like, oh, that's the guy that comes back with a pistol, hidden in that awful beard.  That's true.  We'll take care of the problem, but, you know, there you go.  We had to start with that today. 
[00:21:30]  And bad to see him and Ben pointing at each other.  I've never seen Ben hot under the collar before.  Oh, whatever.  Ben.  Another sweatshirt where you can still see Ben's belt.  He would really need to get you longer shirts.  Yeah, Ben, you were pretty wimpy out there.  He was yelling and screaming at you, pointing at you, and you just took it.  Threatening to throw you out the window?  Exactly.  Like your head would fit through it.  All right.  We got a very, very busy show, obviously.  Yeah, the Yankees won last night. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, can they please do it in nine?  I got to go to sleep.  I missed it.  Jesus.  Yeah, this sleep thing.  I mean, we're trying to figure out.  This is an adventure.  Yeah.  We were like on top of the world doing afternoon radio, and we took on this new challenge.  And we're going to make it work, you know?  I thought I'd have it knocked in a couple of days, but I can't figure this sleep thing out.  The studio is getting in shape, and now we've just got to figure out our sleep schedule.  Yeah.  I watch too much television, is what it is.  And I try to stay up late and go to sleep at about, I don't know, 8 o'clock or something. 
[00:22:30]  He's like, don't you guys have anything else to talk about but me?  We're talking about baseball now, you ass.  Tell him to come in.  He won't come in.  No, I don't want to talk to him.  Why?  He can come in.  I can't go out there.  We're trying to do a radio show.  I've got to go out there and try and listen to us, so I know what's going on.  But now I can't, because he took the radio.  Well, why don't you be a man and take it back, Ben?  I don't know where it is.  Why don't you be the young, strapping, fat bulge-in-the-front-of-the-trousers individual you are?  Take the radio back.  This is hysterical.  Why don't we call Master Poe in here? 
[00:23:00]  There's a reason Master Poe is working for us, or working for XM Satellite Radio.  I shouldn't say for us, because he's an equal.  Master Poe.  There he is.  Ben, what do you need?  Master Poe will take care of it right now.  Watch this.  We need to be able to listen to the show.  He should go home.  Let's just send him home.  Master Poe could do that thing like in Temple of Doom, where he just pulls your heart out  and you see it beating in front of you.  Nice.  How about a little sleeper hold?  Could you do that?  Whatever you want, gentlemen.  Yeah, this guy is an assassin. 
[00:23:30]  Assassin.  Just, you just want the radio on so you can hear it, right?  This is kind of important, you know?  I mean, if something's going on out there, you know, we should be able to listen to the  show.  Very true.  All right.  Well, Master Poe will help you out.  All right.  Ben, why don't you try a little diplomacy?  Go out there and just be a gentleman instead of being a bracing.  I was a gentleman.  Now I'm pissed.  All right.  Then go out there and just take your big hog out and run it against his lips.  Put the radio on and this will stop.  All right.  You tried diplomacy?  My fault.  All right, Ben.  Go try to take care of the situation, all right? 
[00:24:00]  All right.  So, yeah, the sleep pattern thing, right, Ant?  Yeah, can't figure it out.  I usually wind up...  Who's vacuuming out there?  Oh, my God.  There will be changes.  Oh, I'm watching them right next to each other.  Look, now they're talking.  He's leaning over one of the cubicle walls and now chatting with Ben.  He should come here.  This could be a problem.  No, he's all right.  Let him come in here and talk.  Look, maybe he's got a point of view that's valid.  We're trying to do a radio show and they're vacuuming out there.  Well, you've got to get ready for the day.  There's a little office maintenance going on. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, so important at 620.  Sarah, can you stop dropping your beard dandruff in the rug?  All right.  You know, it's that creepy, like that stupid, scaly beard dandruff.  What do they call it?  Psoriasis?  It's psoriasis beard dandruff in the rug.  You have to send a whole crew in.  Now they're...  I think there's a problem.  There is a problem.  Out there.  Like right now.  We don't need these distractions.  I don't think he's yelling.  He's just talking.  Is he just talking?  Because I see Master Poe is walking around him.  And stupid Ben has his face buried in the computer. 
[00:25:00]  Ben, could you stand up and face the man eye to eye?  God almighty.  Not hiding the monitor?  Now both of them are sitting at different cubicles with one little frail cubicle wall  between the two of them.  Oh, this is office tension at its best.  Keeping the peace.  Keeping the peace.  Unbelievable.  Ben's got to walk it off now.  He's walking around thinking of all the things he should have said.  If he was a tough guy.  We really got to get sparks instead of balls.  Just sat there and took it and looked in the monitor.  All right.  So the sleep pattern.  Yankees can't finish it up soon enough. 
[00:25:30]  And I can't figure out the sleep thing.  I wake up at like 8 o'clock at night.  And then I can't get back to sleep until after tough crowd.  I usually like tumbling off to sleep after seeing little Jimmy.  You know.  Gives me sweet dreams.  Right.  So you can count sheep and then picture a fist in them.  Yeah.  For the next week or two.  And I can't figure it out.  So yeah.  I was watching the Yankee game.  I was up for it.  12 innings.  Shouldn't be up for that. 
[00:26:00]  No.  I was long gone before that.  12 innings.  Nice exciting finish.  Beat the 20 to 7 to 6, right?  Yes, they did.  It looked grim.  It looked grim for a while there.  If they would have ended up two down to the Twins, that would have been a problem.  And the Sox won last night, 8-3.  The Sox are looking impressive.  They really are looking impressive.  And that, like Jimmy said, will only make the heartbreak worse.  But I'm telling you one thing.  The Angels, we can't beat.  The Yankees cannot beat the Angels. 
[00:26:30]  You don't think so?  I know they can't.  I don't care if the Angels win eight games in a season, six of them are against New York.  When the Yankees won a 114 game, the Angels were the only team in baseball they had a losing record against.  We can't beat them.  Postseason's so different, though.  And don't you hate...  Like, I put on a little bit of the Boston game.  Don't you hate other cities' fans?  That whole thing where they got the big red rod in their hand and they're, like, shaking it.  Like, I don't think you should have props if you're going to a ballgame as a fan. 
[00:27:00]  I don't like the props that everyone gets.  If the entire stadium gets these little things or the Hankies or some prop that everyone's supposed to use.  It's so lame.  Is that like the rally monkey?  Ugh.  Hey, we got a monkey.  It's going to help us rally.  Stop it.  They pull out the thing.  The big...  The tomahawks.  Oh, and the whole crowd's got them. 
[00:27:30]  Just stop.  Pull out some D-cell batteries to lop at those monkey heads.  And that's it.  You know what would have been acceptable in Cleveland a few years ago?  If all the fans pulled out three headless pitchers and shook them.  Huh?  Or maybe in 1980, the fans pulled out a catcher's mitt with a burnt plane in it and shook it.  Oh, is that wrong?  How about something like that?  Oh.  So you couldn't sleep because of the Yankee game?  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  And then, yeah, what am I supposed to do?  Turn it off and go to sleep?  You can't do that.  I had to finish watching it.  I crashed at 7.  Here's my latest thing.  7 o'clock.  7 o'clock.  I was really beat because I stayed up the whole way.  And I'm thinking that's what we have to do now.  I know that's what I have to do.  And stay up as late as possible and then crash, right?  Can't do it.  So I wake up at 9.30 in a complete panic, bang my head, look at my elbow, cut my arm.  Oh, yeah.  Because I thought that I overslept for the show.  Oh, you had that overslept panic and it was 10 hours before you have to be in? 
[00:28:30]  It was only 9 o'clock at night.  Unbelievable.  Aw, you know what it is?  You're lonely.  You need somebody there to rub little scented oils on your belly.  Oh, by the way, I'm not sharing anymore with the listeners.  Why is that?  You know, I told the story of the enema where I had to go in twice with enemas, right?  I hope he felt a little irregular because he was sick and taking all kinds of medications  that clog you up, I believe.  And you had to go down to the drugstore and get yourself a couple of enemas. 
[00:29:00]  I got 100 emails overnight, 90 were their remedies for what I'm going through.  Oh, for constipation?  Yeah, no more.  I'm done.  Now I got the opposite problem.  I can't stop crapping.  So what you're saying is basically that your colon kind of looked like the ladder up to that  helicopter as Vietnam ended when they were all trying to get on that helicopter.  Jesus.  I don't know.  God bless you.  I wouldn't be able to use one of those things.  I can't do anything with anything back there, you know, unless it's got a toilet paper buffer 
[00:29:30]  or something, you know?  I like using those nice little pop-up wipes to kind of clean yourself up when you're done.  And it's kind of nice, refreshing little, ooh, a little, ooh, that's nice, cool.  It's got aloe in it.  A little menthol?  No, not menthol.  I know.  It's got the cooling aloe in it.  I understand. 
[00:30:00]  You know?  And you use it.  And I don't know if people just take it out because it's, you know, wafer thin.  It's very thin, you know?  And I don't know if people just use that and reach around back there because I don't want  to be feeling the anatomy of the back entrance like that, even through a small, thin little  wipe.  So I take some toilet paper and I lay the little wipe on the toilet paper and then use  it like that.  You don't like to feel your own hole?  No.  Oh, my God.  I don't like feeling that.  You haven't touched your own hole?  No. 
[00:30:30]  No, I steer clear of it.  You're not.  Not only do I...  Why would I want to?  You never rub your finger like between your ball bag and leg and sniff.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  No.  I'm not even joking.  You never do that?  I don't do...  Why would I do that?  Why wouldn't you?  It's there.  Thank God it smells bad.  It's something to do.  I've itched.  You know, but not that far back.  You know, any guy has to itch the bag every so often, but not where I'm reaching around  by the exit.  That's disgusting.  I promise.  Then that smell won't come off your finger for days no matter how much you want. 
[00:31:00]  That's the beauty of it.  Well, because it gets under your nails.  That's why.  Is that why, Ovi?  Thank you for clearing that up.  What's getting under your nails back there?  I have no idea, man.  Because I cannot deal with that back there.  I remember years ago, one time when I was a kid, I slipped up with the toilet paper.  It came off my hand for a second.  And you're like, you trip up and get a little on your finger.  And it didn't matter how much you wash.  An hour later, an hour and a half later, still there. 
[00:31:30]  You forget about it until you go to eat your egg salad sandwich, and your finger brushes  your nose.  Brushes against your nostril.  No, I want no part of it, and I don't deal with anything back there.  And like I said, with the wipe, I have to have a buffer of a big clump of toilet paper  just to use the wipe.  I put a foot up on the bowl.  I put one foot up on the bowl, and I take paper, and I wrap it in my...  All right, this is an attractive image I'm giving.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm a hygiene freak from my crack.  I put paper around my finger, up, and yank out.  I really get in there. 
[00:32:00]  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  I don't just wipe.  Stop it.  I get in there.  See, that's not right.  No paper on the finger, not the raw finger.  No, no, I don't care what's on your finger.  You're not supposed to be doing that.  I always do.  I put my finger in, I curly-cue it around a little bit, and I pull out until the paper  is clean.  Until the paper goes in clean, my God.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Why?  I don't know.  No, that's weird, bro.  No, it's not.  It's clean.  You ask any girl that's giving me analingus, I'm fantastic.  Oh. 
[00:32:30]  Norton is a freak.  I was at his apartment.  I'd ask them if they weren't in the corner crying somewhere, yearning for a shower.  Norton has a shit stool.  What is that?  I had to bring it up, man.  Oh, no, it's okay.  I had to take a leak.  I don't know where we're going.  I don't know, the comedy cell or something.  I go into his bathroom.  He has like a little footstool.  A footstool.  Where he puts his feet, which raises up his legs.  Like an ottoman in front of your toilet?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Instead of having the feet on the floor, he's got these pedals, so it raises his feet up 
[00:33:00]  about six inches off the floor.  Right.  Six to eight inches.  Are your feet even with your butt, is what you're saying?  It's kind of like the thing the guy from Frank's Place would need to get him up to the toilet.  Well, I actually put my feet up because it's better for your insides to have that bit of  balance.  It actually helps you take better dumps.  It's healthier for you to have that balance so you're not straining.  See, that's not that weird.  Really?  It's weird.  I've never seen one of those in my life.  I do have my little feet propped up, but it is kind of like my feet are almost even 
[00:33:30]  with my ass.  It pretty much makes his thighs parallel to the floor, I guess, right?  Yeah, and it's kind of weird because you almost feel like you're falling into the bowl.  You know what I mean?  Because the higher your knees come, the more your ass kind of goes down, and it's kind  of an odd feeling, but it's very healthy.  I'm fascinated.  I do that for health, just to be healthier.  For health reasons.  I've done enough unhealthy things.  I think if I can raise my legs a little when I'm taking a dump, if that helps, then I should  do it.  And then you take the toilet paper around the finger, pull out whatever.  Well, that's at the very end, just to make sure that I'm good.  I actually bought those baby wipes yesterday, just in case I don't have time for a quick 
[00:34:00]  shower.  Yeah.  All right.  Fresh it up.  Yeah.  There you go.  We've done a lot so far.  Oh, yeah.  Very important.  Yankees won, Sox won, Astros won.  Who did the Astros beat?  The Braves, bro.  Good.  I hate the Braves.  Clemens pitched last night, right?  Good.  I want to see Clemens do well.  Good for him.  Of course.  I used to hate Clemens, but now that he's like 42 years old and just kicking ass, it's  the same thing with Muhammad Ali when I was growing up.  I hated Muhammad Ali forever.  But then when he got up there and he became an underdog again, I love underdogs. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, I love that.  I became...  Underdogs, sweet polypure bread.  Right.  And Riff Raff and the other mad scientists.  I love the underdog.  I watch it all the time.  But then when he got into that underdog position, that's when I really started liking Ali.  And I'm doing the same thing with Clemens.  There's no need to fear, underdog is floating like a butterfly, sing like a piece of sherbet.  Or something like that. 
[00:35:00]  I was fine up until I did those Decon Fogon commercials.  Well, you set off the Decon Fogon bomb to get rid of the Rochas.  Remember, I go, Decon Fogon knock out the Rochas.  Unfortunately, it knocked out 98% of Muhammad Ali's brain.  And I can't even talk no more.  Because people think it was the punches I took to the head.  But it was the take after take of those goddamn Decon commercials in a closed room. 
[00:35:30]  Okay, Muhammad.  Take 87.  Set off the bomb for Decon Fogon.  There are dead bugs laying on the floor.  And they have me breathing and this stuff.  And I can't even talk no more.  Because it was a Decon Fogon.  I float like a big boulder and I sting like a little piece of foam.  I used to be the member of the Thriller and Vanilla.  Now I better lay my head on the pillow because I can't even stand up no more. 
[00:36:00]  With the Decon Fogon.  It's a Decon Fogon conclusion.  I can't speak.  What happened to me?  I used to go,  Remember, I used to go,  Hey,  Now I can't even do nothing because I got bug spray on the brain pan.  It might have been the Ropa Dope too.  Ropa Dope.  Now I'm Ropa Dope without the Ropa no more. 
[00:36:30]  Now I'm just the dope.  I can't talk.  Howard Cosell's wig is more coherent than me.  Don't mess with me.  Look at me work the speed bag.  I can't even do nothing no more.  My daughter fight better than me and she got tits.  Well, you spar with her.  I do?  Yes, you do.  When do I do that?  Believe me, I spar with anything. 
[00:37:00]  Just saying hello in the morning is sparring for me.  I need some.  What's that vacuum cleaner going?  I must really be off because I'm imagining I hear a vacuum in a radio studio.  Now I know I'm gone.  This is a radio station.  Why are we vacuuming?  Who's that man walking around the midget with Don King's hair on his face?  What an awful human being. 
[00:37:30]  What an awful human being.  My God.  It looked like Howard Cosell's wig on his head years after he'd been dead.  You guys, I got a plan.  Set off a decon fog on and that roach will be dead in the morning.  Where's smoldering Joe Frazier?  He's doing a lot better than you are these days.  Is he? 
[00:38:00]  Muhammad, yeah.  I'm going to try to come out with one of these grills that you cook food on.  Seems you make a lot of money and you could be an old decrepit ex-fighter and still make money.  They make great wedding gifts.  Good.  The vacuum is off.  I thought I was going senile.  Yeah.  All right.  We got the instant feedback working today.  I think you could figure that out by going to opianthony.com, right? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  They're commenting on hearing a vacuum cleaner in the background.  I know.  I'm sorry.  But you know what?  The mics sound a lot better today.  They really do.  I feel like thank you, by the way, for switching it so my audio wasn't always lost.  I want to thank Jaime.  Yes.  These are omni-directionals.  Oh.  Yeah, there was a uni, right?  Yes.  The unis were the problem because we move around tomorrow.  See, now we can move around.  It's not that bad.  Yeah, it sounds pretty good when I go like this.  You can't even tell that I'm kind of going like that.  Norton needs a bidet, people are saying.  You ever think about that, Jimmy? 
[00:39:00]  I was actually talking to someone recently, some girl that has a big bidet fetish.  But no, I've tried them when I was in Brazil, and I don't know how to set it properly.  It's got to be set?  Yeah, the water really blasts up there.  I look like a Guinness fountain.  So I don't care for the bidet, because the water, if you get the temperature right, you  don't want scalding water going into your crack.  I think if you have it tuned up right, that could be kind of nice, maybe.  Maybe.  Yeah, I'm sure you could.  A little trickle of water down there.  It's just the fact that I know everybody squats over it.  It's just the bidets kind of irritate me. 
[00:39:30]  They do that because they're out of toilet paper in Italy.  All these stupid European countries don't have the paper, so they have to do that.  Yeah.  We don't have to do that.  No, we don't.  No, because we use all the resources in the world.  We should use the resources.  If it wasn't for us, nobody would know what to do with them anyway.  We've invented everything.  The rest of the world sucks.  Using their hand for years.  Exactly.  If it wasn't for us.  Come here, big dog.  This wonderful nation.  You're right.  All right, why don't we step aside?  Quick little break.  All right.  I think we're figuring that out a little better these days, too. 
[00:40:00]  The show is starting to shape up.  Starting to feel good.  Starting to feel like the show that we knew and loved.  And you did an impression of a guy that's still alive.  That's good.  Yeah, figure that one out.  Wow.  Thank you.  All the impressions that Anthony does, most of them died.  Everyone died during the two years we were off.  During our hiatus.  All right.  So, all right.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The only way you're getting a date is with a bottle of chloroform. 
[00:40:30]  Here's another bunch of genetic defectives who've been turned loose on answering machines.  These guys who cannot resist the urge to put music on their outgoing messages.  You know, some guy spends $8 at Radio Shack and suddenly he's a fucking record producer.  And because he's busy in the basement jacking off his dog, I, I have to listen to substandard music. 
[00:41:00]  And it's always rotten music, you know.  It's either New Age, that pointless, meandering zombie noise played by pseudo-spiritual lunatics who think wind chimes are a musical instrument.  Or else it's soft rock.  Soft rock.  That lame-ass, weak, non-threatening, suburban white boy junk played by bands like Men Without Testicles.  Oh, and folks, on these answering machines, do me a favor, would you please? 
[00:41:30]  When you record your outgoing message, don't bother telling me you can't come to the phone.  I understand that.  Apparently, that's why we have these machines.  And don't tell me to leave my name and number.  Somehow, I figured that out.  And if you work in an office, never mind that stuff, I'm away from my desk.  If you had to take a shit, say so.  Just say, hi, this is Mary Louise.  I had the Mexican jalapeno bean chili dip. 
[00:42:00]  And I washed it down with a gallon of gin.  I'll be in and out all day.  Hey.  There are some more people who ought to be strapped into chairs and beaten with hammers.  People who wear visors.  Let me ask you something. 
[00:42:30]  What the fuck is the point in wearing half a hat?  Either get a hat or don't.  No one's interested in the top of your head.  Go back to the store and tell them to give you the rest of the hat.  They cheated you.  Better still, get yourself one of them little Jewish hats and sew it to your visor.  Then you got yourself a full-fledged fucking hat, my friend.  Here are some more musical vermin whose mothers we wish had had medical plans that included abortion. 
[00:43:00]  These singers.  These singers who think they're so special, they only need one name.  Bono, Sting, Jewel, Tiffany, Prince.  What a crock of shit.  Get a fucking last name, would you please?  I got a nice two-word name for you.  Pretentious cocksucker.  How do you like that?  Bono, Sting.  It's not bad enough, the music sucks, but with no last name, you can't find out where they live to throw a fucking bomb through their window. 
[00:43:30]  It's frustrating.  Here are some more people who deserve an inoperable tumor at the base of their spines.  These guys who fly around the world in a fucking balloon.  You know, what is this, 1850? 
[00:44:00]  Get a fucking airline ticket, will you please?  When are the media going to realize no one's interested in some rich trouser stain who's so bored he's got to fly around the balloon all day?  I hope the next guy gets hit by lightning.  He flies around in a little fart circle.  And lands in a sewage treatment pond. 
[00:44:30]  And sinks with the rest of the turds.  Mr. Lighter Than Air.  Staring at my shoes.  Trying to think of something.  It's a freak show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:45:00]  Bill needs coffee.  Coffee.  Bill needs coffee.  Is this the coffee order?  Yeah.  I need milk for my coffee.  What happened, Ope?  No milk?  No milk.  A couple people want to say hi here.  What do we know? 
[00:45:30]  Yes, onion bagel.  Ooh.  We take our little breakfast orders.  Yeah.  Eh, why not?  Beast!  What's up?  Yep.  I just wanted to call you guys and tell you guys you guys are completely and totally messed up.  And I like that in the man.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Beast.  You're a trucker?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a long-haul trucker.  I drive an 18-wheeler.  I'm rolling on down the road, John.  It's where I need to go. 
[00:46:00]  Where are you driving through?  I'm going down through New York right now.  That New York.  Where you keep her between the ditches, I'll shake the leaf trees and you rake the leaves,  good buddy.  You see any of that pretty seat covers in any of them roller skates, good buddy, take her  up to 2-1.  Eh, yeah, yeah.  You guys still have CB radios or no?  Yeah, we do. 
[00:46:30]  Aren't they completely obsolete at this point?  No, not necessarily.  I mean, we can use them to tell each other where the cops are down the road, you know?  Use them to find some gay gentleman to give you a little hobbing of the knob at the next  truck stop?  Every once in a while, you catch somebody that does that, but most of the time, no.  There was a truck stop off the Long Island Expressway, Opie, exit 52, where I used to  have to go and meet up with my helper for the day when I was doing construction. 
[00:47:00]  You know, they'd leave the car there, hop in the company truck, and go off to the job  site.  And every morning, there were tractor trailers sitting there with these gay guys that would  just hop in, as Jimmy loves to do, and just hob the knobs.  It was a big gay trucker meeting place.  What a wonderful thing.  And I guess the CB radio is the way you communicate, you know? 
[00:47:30]  Hey, I'm wheeling up on exit 52.  What's the code for that?  I don't know.  Good answer.  I have no idea.  Why would I know that?  This is Sheriff Beaufort T. Justice looking for a blowjob.  Junior, pull out my hog and start sucking.  I want a Diablo sandwich, a Dr. Pepper, and a blowjob.  Make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry. 
[00:48:00]  Jizz in the face.  That's an attention getter.  This is why satellite radio is great.  That's funny.  I love satellite radio.  Without a doubt.  I don't care if you're a Broderick Crawford.  I'm not sucking your cock in that car.  Wait, wait, what was I?  Oh, the first time, I didn't even know gay guys cruise the rest areas.  I don't know if I ever told this story to any W.  One time I'm in the rest area going to Rascals to do an open mic with my buddy. 
[00:48:30]  My big buddy Larry is in the car, and I went in, and there was an older gentleman.  Probably 60.  And I'm in the bathroom.  I'm at the urinal, and I can feel him looking over at me.  And I kind of look, and he's looking down at my mule.  And I was like, uh, and he's like, that's quite a pretty one.  No, stop it.  I swear to God, those are the exact words he used.  Quite a pretty one.  Quite a pretty one.  Older man mustachioed.  And I'm like, what?  And he goes, would you like to have it sucked?  And I was so freaked out.  I'm like, no, thank you.  And I just left.  His name wasn't Richard, was it? 
[00:49:00]  No, of what?  No, it wasn't in a tree house, was it?  No.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  This guy was somebody's grandfather.  And he's like, that's quite a pretty one.  Would you like to have it sucked?  There's a proud moment for Grandpa hanging out at the truck stop bathrooms looking to a hob a knob.  I had no idea they even did that until I caught him looking.  Yeah.  That whole scene, there's the showers in there and everything.  It's just...  Homo-erotic.  Yeah.  You know, I don't want to be in there.  We've got to bring Steve in here because he was obsessed with going to one of those truck stops where we were driving to Cleveland. 
[00:49:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Where they have the showers and everything?  Yeah.  I keep hearing about them.  I just wanted to check one out.  I'd never seen one.  No, be serious, man.  We were driving to Cleveland for that gig we did up there.  And every one of those big, huge, massive...  What are they called?  I don't even know.  Travel America, something like that, right?  Yeah.  See him sauntering in.  Into the truck stop with that music playing.  Big martini glass.  With his little olive and swizzle stick.  Oh, don't spill it. 
[00:50:00]  But I keep passing these truck stops and he was bummed and I wasn't stopping.  I'm like, dude, look at me.  I'm like chum for these freaking guys.  I'm not going there.  Oh, that.  You really are an 11 in a rest area.  Keep chumming.  I hope he goes into the truck stop.  Homos in the truck stop are homos.  Farewell and adieu to you, fair Spanish lady.  I had a couple of experiences with Steve at a couple of truck stops.  Really?  Kevin, be very careful how you word that.  You had experiences with Steve at truck stops?  Be very careful how you word this. 
[00:50:30]  So when you guys were driving home from Buffalo, I think, right?  That time, yes.  And you actually stopped with him?  I was too scared to stop.  Why?  Did you scrub each other's back in the shower?  I drove Steve home from Buffalo and he was hammered.  Yeah, Steve was shit-faced and then decided to leave.  Yeah.  You know.  So he went with me and we stopped about an hour and a half into the trip.  We stopped at one of these stops and I said, I'm going to go get gas, Steve.  And he goes, I don't know.  And he got out of my car. 
[00:51:00]  About 20 minutes later, I had had gas and breakfast and still didn't know where Steve was.  So I went into the rest stop to find him.  Only to find Steve just wandering around the rest stop, just looking up.  That's not what I was doing.  You make it sound like I was running, like wandering around in circles.  No, no, no, no.  Did he have the remnants of that brown shopping bag around his feet?  Crinkle, a crinkle.  And he was just wandering around and I said, Steve.  And he goes, oh, oh.  Oh, hey, Kev.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go.  No, I just, I was fascinated because you walk, I worked at one of those, whatever, warehouses 
[00:51:30]  in Kearney, New Jersey, when I was like 15 years old sweeping around, I would see all  these truckers coming in and they would have like the, all these, these, well, this sounds  so sexy.  A 15 year old Steve.  Listen to the excitement in his voice.  Had a full beard already.  I did actually.  They had, um, these huge cabs with all these, you know, these, you know, these, uh, like  little apartments basically in the back.  Oh, the big sleeper cabs that they have on there. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, the big sleeper cabs.  And I was like, wait, where the hell do these guys go?  And they would tell me about all these truck stops where they would sell these fake Rolexes  and, and weird, you know, uh, CD radios and electronics.  Sounds like paradise.  I know, doesn't it?  It's like, it sounds like a paradise to you, Steve.  I just wanted to check one out and Ope wouldn't stop on the whole way over to Cleveland.  No way.  What'd you want to do?  Did you want to hop in the cab, did you, and pretend you were sleeping?  I did.  Did your husband trucker came back there?  The only thing that happened in those back, uh, cabs is, is horrible sex and murders.  I didn't know. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  You gotta watch that.  Every one of those cabs smells like runaway blood.  Well, all the, all the truckers have satellite radio.  So let's say hi to Dave, another trucker.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, just wanted to comment on your, uh, you're, you're ganging up on the truck stops.  Not all of them are like that.  And the showers are, they're, they're.  Oh, we're trying to get them all like that, though.  That's right.  That's our goal here.  No, they're not all like that.  Most of us are just family guys out here trying to make a living and, uh.  Sure.  Not too easy.  Right. 
[00:53:00]  Okay.  But, uh, yeah, there's, there is gay stuff that goes on, but, you know, you gotta overlook  that.  I mean, there's gonna be there anywhere.  You ever been in the shower and been propositioned?  No, they're, they're locked, you lock the door, they're just one person showers.  There's like 10 or 15 of them in, you know, in a big truck stop.  Get a little knock on the shower door.  Need a little help with the undercarriage?  I think I left something in there.  No, 13 years, man.  Never had that happen.  Me and Bob Kelly walked into a rest area on the way home from a gig, like 1.30 in the 
[00:53:30]  morning in upstate New York, and we walk in and there's a guy, he's got his mule out  and he's standing over the sink and he's washing his hog in the sink.  God, he must have had a real, uh, nice, attractive hooker just before, uh, he was washing his  mule.  Yeah, I don't think he was a gay thing.  I think, obviously, well, maybe he had, I don't know, he's probably pulling corn and...  When you have to wash it off right after you're done with business, not a good thing.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a good thing.  I have another Steve C. truck stop story.  Ooh.  On the way home from Boston.  Because the first one was so fascinating.  Steve C. and sex bagel on it.  Well, this one, Steve is sober, so it's different. 
[00:54:00]  I hope you don't call him sex bagel at the truck stops.  Yeah, no doubt.  We, uh, we stopped to have breakfast on the way home from Boston and, and Steve, uh, was  in the, uh, the Mart area of the rest stop, uh, while we were waiting for our food to come  to the table.  And, uh, Steve C. came back with two bags full of, of truck stop merchandise.  And I couldn't imagine what Steve had bought.  And then he starts pulling out delightful shirts and do-rags.  It's like he's gone to Disney. 
[00:54:30]  It really is.  To him, these truck stops are like Disney World.  It is.  Including the shirt he's wearing today.  Yeah.  You're a homoerotic weirdo, you know that?  That is really odd that he finds these truck stops like an amusement park for him.  I, I just, you know what?  I saw the shirts in a huge rack, a huge rack of, of baseball hats that-  Six Flags Texaco.  That have diamond plate on the brim.  I've never seen a baseball hat that had diamond plate studded on the, on the brim.  There's a must-by.  There's a reason for that.  It's awful.  What else did you pick up?  A couple of Foxworthy tapes, you jackass? 
[00:55:00]  You know, and, but, but this, this, this lovely shirt with the skull and crossbones on the  You got that at a truck stop?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's talk to Brandon.  What's up, Brandon?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Welcome back.  All right.  Now, for the gay guys in truck stops, they're called good buddies.  Good buddies.  Now, in the old days, if you said, hey, good buddy, that was just, you know, somebody,  a fellow trucker on the CB, but apparently it's now turned into some gay guy reference.  Now it's, now it's actually more accurate.  That's what a good buddy does. 
[00:55:30]  That is a good buddy.  And also, if they're at a, at a, uh, a rest area, they're called Tickle Park Keith.  Oh, I didn't quite get that.  Pickle Park Pete.  I still can't get Pickle Park Pete?  Yes.  Oh, Pickle Park Pete.  Hey, how about that?  What's that mean?  Uh, gay guy looking to give him, I guess.  I have no clue.  You are a silver-tongued devil. 
[00:56:00]  Breaker, breaker.  Oh, we went down this road today.  Let's say hi to Nick.  What's up, Nick?  Nick.  Hey, uh, these gay guys on the CB, they call them good buddies.  I'll hear them at night at the truck stop.  They get on there, anybody looking for a good buddy?  And some of them are queer bashers.  They'll have guys get up in their truck.  They'll beat the hell out of them.  CBs are only good for a couple of things all day.  Unless you're using them at a customer, all you ever do is you hear gay guys trolling for somebody,  or you just hear, like, two frenzies yelling at each other all day. 
[00:56:30]  Two what?  Yeah, I can't see CBs being very relevant these days.  What, is it cell phones?  Yeah, you got cell phones, so if you need to talk to anybody, you know.  And then there's all kinds of navigation and traffic reports and everything,  so you really don't need to get on that CB.  But what if there's a smoky, smoky?  Yeah, that's why I never had one for a while, but the only reason I have it is because you  and the customers.  We got us a Kojak with a Kodak up here.  A Kojak with a Kodak. 
[00:57:00]  Keep burping twixt the ditches, good buddy.  Do you think that they ever say that there's a good buddy, Lebanese fella?  Maybe he's got, like, little pieces of urinal cake and his awful piazza beard?  He'd probably buy the urinal cakes in there.  Oh, these are nice.  I'll use them in my bathroom at home.  I can put them under my arms because I sweat like I just accidentally murdered someone.  We'll take one more.  Wendy, what's up?  Well, you know, you guys have way too much homoerotic material. 
[00:57:30]  Did you put up Robert Mapplethorpe pictures instead of Sinatra stuff?  You think it's a little too homoerotic?  There's a lot of...  Well, there's just a lot of gay stuff happening in the world these days, you know?  There's definitely a gay undertone to this show.  Why is that?  No, there's not.  Oh, my God.  We got promos basically showing that Aunt and I are getting banged up the butt by prisoners and stuff.  Are you talking about Jimmy putting toilet paper around his fingers and digging deep? 
[00:58:00]  But that's for hygiene reasons for a young gal to swab it.  Steve going into the truck stops.  I mean, yeah, you know something?  I'm agreeing with this woman.  I am agreeing.  You're right.  There is a little too much homoeroticism going on in this program.  I totally disagree.  There's not enough.  Wendy, are you a trucker?  Yes, I am.  Oh, you are.  Are you hot?  Or do you look like large Marge?  Well, okay.  At night, I tell people I weigh 300 pounds, but then they're the ones that stare at me during the day. 
[00:58:30]  Are you hot when you get out of that truck?  Is it like, hey, look at her there.  She's a bird of sheep cover.  That's right.  That's embarrassing.  I'm not like...  No, I'm too modest for that.  Are you a good Betty?  Yeah, I am a Betty.  Got a lot of upper body strength to wheel that big steering wheel around.  Yeah, lower body strength.  Oh, my God, you guys.  Yeah?  Double clutching? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah?  No?  Hot?  But don't worry.  They're keypadded.  The guy's right.  You can lock the door and there's a keypad.  A keypad in the shower?  Yeah.  You must be a treat, though, walking into the...  Oh, well, they're not co-ed showers, are they?  No, they can be if you want them to be.  Aren't they single showers, most of them?  Yeah, most of them are single showers. 
[00:59:30]  That is true.  How...  Do you have a problem with the area down there, though, sitting so long?  I hear that's not good for a woman.  It could...  You get that yeast thing going.  Don't wear tight jeans.  No?  Oh, is that it?  You got to wear some loose pants?  Why, do you ever stand up and have muffins in your socks?  No.  Some dunking munchkins coming out of her cuff?  No?  No, no muffins in your socks.  Well, you had to...  Something tells me you had to learn somehow that you shouldn't wear tight pants. 
[01:00:00]  So you must have done it once.  No.  Yeah?  No, no.  Everything's got to be nice and moose.  Unleavened bread?  Oh, God, they've done it really bad.  Where are you now?  Utah.  Utah, huh?  All right.  Hi, Gary.  I know he's listening.  My goofy friend.  I made him listen to you guys because he just...  Yeah, pretty much...  It's so crazy.  Pretty much every trucker has XM satellite radio, so this is pretty cool.  Spread the word about the Opie and Anthony show, all right, on the CB for us. 
[01:00:30]  I will.  All right, Wendy.  That's great.  Thank you.  What's your handle, foxy lady?  I don't have one.  Oh, okay.  Well, all right.  Help us spread the virus, the ONA virus, all right?  I will.  Thanks, Wendy.  All right.  Bye.  Spread that virus at the truck stop.  Wendy's all right.  Okay.  Female truck driver like that.  All right, we're going to step aside for, hopefully, a comedian that's not named George  Carlin.  I don't mind a Carlin bit, but how about one that we didn't hear within the last, say, 
[01:01:00]  eight hours?  We're working on it.  I know.  This is a work in progress.  I love these.  Every day, the show getting more gooder.  More gooder.  I think every day it gets one more gooder.  One more gooder?  One more gooder.  And we've got to say hi to everyone that turned on their XM satellite radios overnight, man.  Thank you.  Every day we get a bigger audience.  For your activation.  This is beyond exciting.  This is beyond exciting, so.  All right.  Yeah, do whatever.  Do you have an Audi belly button?  You ever eat an entire chocolate cake?  The O.B.  You ever eat an entire show?  The O.B. 
[01:01:30]  The O.B.  The O.B.  The O.B.  The O.B.  The O.B.  The O.B.  The O.B.  The O.B.  Here we are, dear old friend, you and I drunk again, laughs have been had and tears have been shared, maybe the whiskey's gone to my head. 
[01:02:00]  But if I were gay, I would give you my heart, and if I were gay, you'd be my work of art, and if I were gay, we would swim in romance, but I'm not gay, so get your hand out of my pants. 
[01:02:30]  It's not that I don't care, I do, I just don't see myself in you, another time, another scene, I'd be right behind you. 
[01:03:00]  If you know what I mean, cause if I were gay, I would give you my soul, and if I were gay, I would give you my whole being, and if I were gay, we would tear down the walls, but I'm not gay, so won't you stop cupping my pants. 
[01:03:30]  We've never hoped, we've never kissed, I've never been intimate with your fears, but you have opened brand new doors.  Get over here and drop your drawers. 
[01:04:00]  She won't tell you where you left your socks, she rolled up and down your fat brick, but it was Lee who took her to the Meg Ryan flick. 
[01:04:30]  She's got a face full of nuts, and a mouth full of cots, she's done see Larry King, four new kids on the block, she blew the Winnipeg Jets right after a game, but they never got to know her actual name.  She's got a full name on your face, she will piss on your chest, she might poop, but she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup. 
[01:05:00]  That's simply reasonable, she'll bite you, she'll spike you, but she'll never thank you for free.  Cause baby, cause baby, comes on to me.  Coming on!  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio, XM satellite radio, radio to the power of X. 
[01:05:30]  3  1  2  1  2  2  2  2 
[01:06:00]  3  2  1  Turn this fucking thing down.  Thank you.  What is this, a band you manage?  Holy crap.  Steve's picking the rejoiner music, obviously.  What band is that, Steve?  That's Can't Kill Yourself.  That's the one that's all over the Jackass show.  Oh, great.  Still stinks.  I like Jackass, but that song stinks.  Well, that's why I picked it.  How about some Sabbath?  No.  All right.  Ben will take care of that.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:06:30]  Thanks for joining us.  Greetings and salutations.  You know what's cool about satellite radio?  As a listener, you don't have to sit through like 20 minutes of commercials,  but it gives us no time to do anything.  Nothing.  You can't even eat.  You run, take a leak, put some milk in your coffee, and you're back on the radio.  It's good for the listener, but it's a little weird for us so far.  Back in the action.  Man, we're used to, on commercial radio, you do a good hour of radio,  and then you step aside for 20 minutes. 
[01:07:00]  I know.  Make phone calls, check your email.  The things we used to do during commercials.  Back in five, back in five.  Right.  Back in seven, back in ten.  I remember polishing off a full beer, a full cigarette,  and a full game of foosball up till ten.  You know, playing up till ten.  Yeah.  In one break.  And then some pinball.  Did we actually work there?  We barely worked.  We could admit that now. 
[01:07:30]  A couple of shots of Jägermeister.  Yeah, we barely worked.  And where is our Jägermeister machine?  My brother has it.  Is he going to bring it back in?  I don't know.  He might keep that thing.  Really?  Yeah, it was one of those situations where you never think you're going to work again,  and you're not going to need it.  And then you finally get a job and go,  boy, that would go nice right here.  We'll have to get another one for the office.  We really are getting a lot of new listeners every day,  people that have never heard us.  Yeah, I'm very surprised.  The one thing we've got to tell people that we're a bunch of alcoholics, or used to be.  Well, the staff now seems to drink more than the on-air personality. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, Ant and I are pretty much reformed these days.  But it got to a point on our old show that we invited a bartender in every Friday  to bartend happy hour.  And management, we were doing so well,  and bringing in so much money and bringing in the ratings,  they just would not tell us no.  So, I remember Ken Stevens looking at us going,  guys, why are they rolling in a full-service bar?  Oh, we started this new bit, man.  It's happy hour on the Opie and Anthony show every Friday. 
[01:08:30]  Didn't you know?  Didn't you get the memo?  And he was too scared.  And no one at Infinity Broadcasting was brave enough to tell us no.  Right up until they booted us out the door.  And then we had shot girls, remember?  Yeah, shot girls walking around.  Walking around, giving shots out.  Well, a lot of stations have that guy that might come on on Friday afternoon  and do like a happy hour type thing or, you know, from the bar or something like that.  We just figured we would really do it.  Instead of faking it.  Yeah, instead of just using sound effects, we had a real bar. 
[01:09:00]  And then the good people at Jägermeister gave us a Jägermeister machine  that served chilled Jägermeister shots.  Three bottles went into the top of it,  and chilled Jäger came out of the tap.  Icy, icy cold Jäger.  And we would go back to the office and just pour out shots.  And those were the days where we had hot chicks around constantly.  Yeah.  And now we got a very gay undertone happening here.  Yeah, you know, people are commenting on that,  and I have to agree with them.  We really need to exercise this gayness with some hotness. 
[01:09:30]  We need a lot of hotness immediately, sooner than later.  Who's going to be the first chick we can get up here?  Into this studio.  And I don't want to piss people off.  We're okay with the gay.  We're all right with the gay.  We just don't want to be overly gay on this radio show.  You know?  Too late.  I know.  I'm going to get a webcam show from that girl, Jen.  Are you?  Yeah.  Oh, Jen played What's in My Pants on Tuesday.  I can't believe it's only been a couple of days that we're on the air, 
[01:10:00]  and Jimmy's already hooking up.  I'm not hooking up.  She lives in Michigan, but she sent me a video.  You whore yourself out all over the country.  All of a sudden, it'll be like, I got a gig in Michigan.  Yeah.  You'll wind up hooking up with her.  What city were we in?  Where were we that the chick knew you?  Was that the Long Island event?  They knew them everywhere.  No, but you hooked up with her sister or something?  Oh, I don't.  Yeah, I think I know Amy.  Every time these girls come up to us at these appearances that we've been doing,  they're like, hi.  And they're like, hi, Jimmy.  And it's odd to me. 
[01:10:30]  I'm like, wow, they seem friendly.  You know, and Jimmy comes over.  He's like, oh, I banged the hell out of that one about a month ago.  Or, oh, I have their sister.  He's got like a story about every girl that comes to these appearances.  He's just ravaged them.  Well, he got a handy last night.  Yeah, but I paid for it.  I got a massage.  It was a rush job.  How much is a handy?  Well, the massage for 30 minutes is a half hour,  and that comes with a hand release at the end,  which is pretty fine for a good massage.  But there was no time for a massage.  I had a spot at the strip and wanted to sell it. 
[01:11:00]  So she came over, and I just lay it on my back.  Yeah.  I just went, get right to work, you silly goose.  Wow, you all right?  Speaking of goose.  Wow.  Sounds like one honking in the corner.  Getting better every day.  I think a JFK-sized piece of brain matter came out in that tissue.  Just hit you in the forehead.  Wow, so how much does a handy?  It costs $100.  Wait, wait.  You pay $100, you get a massage, and a full release,  and how long does it usually take?  Well, 30 minutes is a massage release,  but it's like $130 for the hour. 
[01:11:30]  But I didn't have time,  so I laid on my back, and she yanked out baby oil,  and she knew what I wanted,  and she had such, she had like one of those,  like little plump athlete dumpers.  Like, you know, it was phenomenal.  Was she a white chick?  Yeah.  Like, she had a real shelf hiney,  and she was sexy.  But she just, she jerked me a little in her face.  She kind of looked like Eddie Ift,  who's a comedian I know,  used to be on The Sports Guys.  That's what her face reminded me of.  But the body was great,  and I tried to lick her nipple,  and she's like, oh, I'm too shy. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  Which meant pay extra.  Keep your face away from my body.  Exactly.  Keep your little reptilian, shinless face,  and lizard-like tongue away from my supple bosoms.  How much money would you say you spend  a month on sex?  A lot.  I don't even want to,  I won't allow myself,  because some of them take checks.  Won't allow it.  No, my hands won't allow it.  Your wife, is she like, she's dead?  No, I, uh...  She's very badly raped, you see? 
[01:12:30]  I, uh...  I, uh...  I, uh...  Uh, I write checks to some of them.  That's bad.  You write checks?  Yeah.  So your bank account number  is at the bottom of this check,  and a little routing number and everything?  Do you know how much you spent last year on this?  No, I won't look at it.  Once I deal with this figure...  You gotta have a, like...  You have to have a ballpark figure  in your head  how much you spend per month on sex.  Give me a minute to think about that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  It's possible over 20 grand last year, 
[01:13:00]  25 grand?  Wow.  25,000 a year.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe around there.  Wow.  Jesus.  You are a complete degenerate.  I'm garbage.  You better sell a lot more CDs, man.  Do you understand?  So you could buy a nice car  with what you spend having sex.  I could buy a Saturn.  Yeah.  Which I do drive.  Mm-hmm.  Family sedan.  Family sedan  that you pick up your hookers in.  Oh, yeah, I really do.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  It's like, but how much the guy spent... 
[01:13:30]  Look at this.  Look at it this way.  And Florentine is...  This is why Florentine's  one of my best friends.  He has this way  of making you feel better.  He's like, look, dude,  how many guys buy a Porsche  just to get laid  and it works half the time  or whatever?  That's 80 grand.  Oh, brilliant.  That's not rationalizing it too much.  It is, though.  Jim's right.  That's brilliant, man.  Florentine's one of the...  Like, one time I paid,  I think, 400 bucks  for a full toilet service,  which is when a dominatrix  comes over and uses you  as a toilet.  And that's a lot of money  and I was really depressed.  He goes, look,  I just spent three grand  on my girlfriend's purse.  So what?  At least you'll get  some enjoyment out of that. 
[01:14:00]  What's the problem?  Yeah, but you know something?  For 25 grand  and that whole Porsche analogy,  it's you have the Porsche  when you're done.  It's not like you're...  It's not like you're rinsing  the Porsche  off your sheets after...  No, no, no,  but I'm talking about  the main reason  to get the Porsche,  what, to call it around  your dumb friends?  It's to get laid.  So what I'm saying  is like I'm getting laid  constantly,  probably more than  the guy on the Porsche  because I'm spending money.  I'm not taking the crapshoot.  I'm not taking them  out to dinner.  I'm with them.  I'm rationalizing.  You think I don't know  that I'm this close away 
[01:14:30]  from a self-inflicted  gunshot wound?  Oh, no, don't get me wrong.  I'm fascinated by your lifestyle.  It's awful.  It's awful.  Your degenerate sexual lifestyle.  That's a good feeling,  by the way,  when you're sober  for, I guess,  17 years now  and you're duct-taping  plastic bags  to your bathroom floor.  When you're duct-taping  bags together  so you can lay  on your back...  See, here's the problem.  When you have to work  before or after  a sex act,  it's really bad,  especially after  because there have been  times where you're 
[01:15:00]  doing stuff  and it's before  you shoot  and you're like,  this is great,  fantastic.  The second you're done,  you feel like a complete idiot.  You feel awful.  You feel like...  And now you've got  to clean up whatever  trapezes you've set up  or, you know,  now you've got to live  with your pubes  being cut off.  Right.  You've got to put  the dildos  in the dishwasher.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You've got to put them back.  It seemed like a good idea  at the time  when I was caught up  in the moment.  So when you're  cleaning up afterwards, 
[01:15:30]  you're taking sex toys  by these two fingers  and barely touching them  and dropping them  in the sink.  Why'd I buy a white one?  I'll never get the blood  out of this thing.  So in your case...  I can only imagine  what it's like in his case.  In your case,  you get caught up  in the moment,  you need this done  and she comes over,  she does it,  you've got the plastic bags  all taped to the floor  and stuff,  but then it's over,  you pay her,  she leaves,  and now you've got  to clean this mess up.  You've got to go...  That's the sound  of the tape  being pulled off the tub.  How does it feel  like after you're done  and you have to wipe off 
[01:16:00]  that stinky Lincoln log  off your chest?  Wipe off?  Try gargle?  What am I,  what am I,  a rookie?  Um, please,  I, I, I actually have,  I actually have,  uh, what is that  white stuff?  Uh, the, uh,  a column.  No, I don't gargle  with that.  Uh, hydro, uh,  you know,  it's good for cuts  and stuff like that.  Are you kidding?  You have some kind of...  Hydrogen peroxide,  I gargle with that raw  when I'm done.  You gargle with  hydrogen peroxide  to get the,  the bacteria  out of your mouth. 
[01:16:30]  Uh, just to make sure  none of it gets  into any cuts  or anything.  I can't believe  you do stuff like this.  You must foam  like you have rabies.  You know what's funny too?  After you do that.  I got a massage  about two weeks ago  from this chick,  uh, I met off Craigslist  and she,  and in her ad she's like,  I don't do any full service.  If you want sex,  don't come here,  go to another girl.  Full service is  actual sexual intercourse.  Yeah.  Um, or oral or whatever.  But she's like,  uh, I'll give you  a great massage  and it'll be sexy.  Like she's,  and she's indicating  that she's gonna give you  a hand release.  And she gives you a hand.  She's so hot.  So I'm,  I'm in her place.  She's got these two  bullmast of dogs  and I'm on her bed 
[01:17:00]  and she's massaging me  and she goes,  uh, for an extra 50,  I'll strap one on  and put it in your ass.  Oh, there you go.  And I didn't,  I, she,  she put on the strap on  and she stood in front of me  but I was like,  nah, no thank you.  She actually got it on though.  Yeah.  I, I, I'm not into that.  That's not my thing.  I had one chick try it once.  That's not my thing.  See, on our,  our old radio show,  our old radio show,  we brought this topic up  and Aunt and I,  you know,  if you do that,  we're like,  you gotta be gay.  Yeah, yeah.  So many straight guys  called up and said,  no way, man.  Boy, I'm glad we're getting away  from the homoerotic stuff.  Oh yeah. 
[01:17:30]  It's not my thing though.  It's not my thing.  Can we get some hot girls  in here, please?  We need some girls in here.  Look at this console.  It's perfect to put a naked girl  right in the middle of all of us  and we're gonna have  a sushi party one day.  They laughed,  they laughed at us  when I said it  but I'm like,  I'm telling you,  we're gonna lay up,  the hottest girl  you could imagine right here.  They do this in Japan.  I got, I got cash on me.  I don't care if we gotta  get a stripper or something.  Just get a girl down here.  We gotta get the gay out of here.  You can't have sushi  because you won't be able  to tell if the sushi's bad  or if it's her.  You get something  that's not quite as, 
[01:18:00]  you know, similar.  Quite as fishy.  Yeah, we need some kind  of hotness down here  because,  just to get,  get the room  de-homified.  De-homified.  I think.  Sure.  So the handy was good last night?  Not bad.  I said it was baby oil.  I hate baby oil.  What do you prefer?  Eros Lubricant.  Baby oil is just  Eros Lubricant?  It's phenomenal, dude.  It's phenomenal.  What's wrong with baby oil?  I just don't like the texture.  One time I was in LA  and I called for,  LA, I hate, 
[01:18:30]  especially for prostitutes.  I called it Escort  and two of them came over  and they wanted 300 bucks.  This is years ago.  That was just to show up.  So they're like  wanting hundreds more  to do anything.  They're like,  we'll dance for you.  And I wanted to cut their heads off.  Dance.  So I'm like,  go ahead, dance.  And I laid there  and I just jacked myself  with baby oil  and they hated my guts  because they weren't getting tipped.  I'm sure.  And it was the lamest,  like look up at the ceiling  type of dance  and I was packing a half.  I was,  my penis was ashamed  of my behavior.  And I used baby oil. 
[01:19:00]  So that's my last baby oil.  Yeah, not a big fan  of the baby oil.  It was the type of tugging  where you tug up once  and then have to put  your hand back  and re-grip.  Tug up once,  have to put your hand back  and re-grip.  Baby oil is definitely  a beginner type of lubricant.  When you're growing up  and you finally reach  that point  where you want to try out  doing stuff to yourself,  it's pretty much  what's in the house.  Yeah.  It's that  or Vaseline,  which is awful.  That'll get everywhere 
[01:19:30]  and leave an oil slick  on the sink  and everything else.  When your mother  goes in there later  and goes to wash her hands  and the sink  is repelling water.  It's like not even  getting wet.  I think she knows  her little boy  is jacking it in there.  Excuse me,  why are the towels dry  even after I try  to wash them?  How come no water  can be absorbed  into anything  in the bathroom?  There's a grease slick  on the shower curtain.  We got a new problem. 
[01:20:00]  Yes.  We hired Sex Bagel, Eric.  He's got problems too.  He stood in line  for how long last night  for this?  He stood in line  for like 45 minutes.  We went to the  big smoke event here.  Oh, you got the picture?  Let me see.  Sex Bagel stood in line  for 45 minutes  to get his picture  taken next to a naked girl  that's on a screen.  She's not even  a real naked girl.  Let me see this.  And he waited 45 minutes?  He was in line  for easily 45 minutes  for a stupid picture. 
[01:20:30]  Why?  He's got problems.  Get him in here.  Okay.  It's him standing.  It's superimposed.  It's a Photoshop job  is what it is.  It's like they stand  in front of a screen.  You could have done this  on your computer  at home in five minutes.  Yeah, you could do this  on a Photoshop.  What's wrong with you?  It's a girl.  She's painted like silver  and she's lighting a lighter  and he's standing  in front of her  with a cigar.  I guess you were  at a cigar bar, right?  Eric, do you understand  what show you're working for now?  We went.  Steve was supposed  to go with me yesterday.  There's an event  called The Big Smoke  here in New York.  He smoked cigars. 
[01:21:00]  There's plenty of martinis  but Steve wasn't there  and there's chicks  dancing in cages.  It's pretty cool.  This chick is very hot.  Steve needed to sleep last night.  Steve would have been  bad news at this thing yesterday.  So I had bought the ticket  so I told Eric,  come with me.  They have steak.  It's an unbelievable event  but he waited in line.  We should have seen  the other messes  waiting in line.  It was all like the,  you know.  And you.  Eric, you're working  for the Opie and Anthony show.  Within weeks,  this whole place  is going to have  naked live girls  all over the place.  I sure hope so.  Why wait 45 minutes for this? 
[01:21:30]  Well, Ben was walking around  doing his thing  and I got all the cigars  for Ben and Steve  for them to divvy up.  I had nothing else to do  so I just was waiting in line.  Figured,  why not go and get the picture?  I feel some time.  Now it's in front of what?  What kind of screen?  It's like a black screen.  Oh, a black screen?  It's this awful green curtain  and they're just standing there  like, oh, pose like this,  pose like that.  Okay,  and then they take the picture  and they come back.  And you don't see any girl  next to you or anything?  No, it's just like a green screen.  How much was that?  It's free.  Well, thank God for that  because if you paid a dime for it 
[01:22:00]  I'd reach over there  and hit you.  You had to.  Look at the pose  with the cigar.  They gave you their cigar  and then they're like,  you've got to pose this way,  you've got to do it for this  and then come back  in 15 minutes  we'll have the photo done for you.  You know what's really funny  about that?  Look at the whole  setup of the picture.  You could imagine  a guy  that looks like  a businessman  in a suit  with the cigar  and it would kind of  look like an ad  for something.  But with him in there  it looks like  someone's son  stepped in  and wanted to get 
[01:22:30]  a picture taken  with a nice lady.  There were.  There were a lot of  businessmen there  on that line  taking the photo.  Of course there were  a bunch of douchebags.  That's their idea  of a fun night.  I'll show the guys  at work.  I've got to hide  this picture  from the wife.  Don't let her see it  when I get home.  I know the right  was working late.  You know what?  We're going to get  pulled back in again  but I have to mention this.  It looks like he's got  a cucumber  in the front of his pants  because he's got  the side view.  Look at this thing.  Are you packing, Eric?  Are you packing  something there, bro?  How big a boy are you?  Or did you put  a banana in front  before you went  to get your photo? 
[01:23:00]  No, I guess  it's just natural.  Look at this freaking thing.  The other thing was  there was a lot  and then they had girls  dancing behind screens  and in cages  and then all these tools  are waiting in line.  Waiting in line  to take a picture  in front of an empty  green screen  so they could  superimpose a hot chick  on it.  There were plenty  of hot chicks  around at every table.  Why didn't you just  go up to a real girl  and go,  hey, can I take  a picture of you?  You're pretty hot.  There were actually  losers doing that  to the poor Budweiser girl.  They were making  take photos with them.  Those liquor girls  are the best, man. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, they are.  They hired just a ton  of strippers,  put them in evening gowns  and they were all  just walking around  giving whiskey and scotch.  So you go up to one of them  and go, hey,  can I get a picture with you?  And it's a live chick.  Not in front of  a green screen.  That's great.  What other choice  was there?  You could get your picture  with the Millennium Falcon?  Look at me.  Look who I'm with.  That would have been cool  if it was 1985  but you could do that  at home now.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Well, it was either that  or they had custom-made 
[01:24:00]  Harleys that you could sit on  and pretend that was you.  Oh, yeah, that's stupid.  Yeah.  That's at least  a real object.  Yeah.  You want to come over  to my apartment?  Put that on foundry.  I got a green screen  in the bathroom.  It'll look like you have  logs on your chest  when you're finished.  God, that stupid picture  bugs me.  That's great.  But that's exactly  what business guys do.  That's exactly  what they do  with their fucking  dumb friends.  They stand there  with a cigar  and their little tie.  Oh, we talked  to the girl in the silver.  Another brandy, please.  Bunch of dullards. 
[01:24:30]  They look like  she really likes me.  Yeah, they bother the girls.  So, yeah, I'm in finance.  She's a prostitute, stupid.  She doesn't care about you.  Oh, are they boring?  Give me the Darth Vader helmet.  That's why I spend money.  Take a picture.  Hey, Tim, what's up?  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  Welcome back.  What's up, man?  I'm so glad you guys are back.  I was stuck  listening to that  fucking hook-nosed Jew bastard.  Jesus.  I was turned.  Oh, my. 
[01:25:00]  It's inappropriate, sir.  We don't need any  racial epithets.  Epithets.  Any anti-Semitic  words being thrown around.  That fucking  nigga robbing  Oh, my.  Come on, now.  Fucking monkey.  All right.  All right.  Now, sir,  I happen to have  my young son in the car  and I don't like  that kind of language.  You looked a lot taller  on the radio.  Funniest line ever.  Hey, boy,  where's Sheriff Brantford?  Hey, boy. 
[01:25:30]  I am Sheriff Brantford.  Joe from Syracuse.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, there.  This is Fudgy,  the gay trash hauler.  How are your boys doing?  Better now.  Are you trying to do  a character?  Yes, I am.  You've got to be  really brave to do  a character on the  Opie and Anthony show.  He's trying to do a  cactus.  Yeah, this is not some  Midwestern mom-and-pop show  that you call in  and they think the  characters are funny.  Unless you,  if your character has SARS,  we want to hear it.  Hi, I'm on a plane.  Ah-choo!  Yeah, you've got to  call Bob and Tom  with that one, bro.  They'll appreciate that, 
[01:26:00]  I think.  Ugh.  Fudgy, the gay trash hauler.  What are you packing today?  The whole studio cracks up.  Hey, and stick around  for our call from Fudgy  later on in this hour.  Shut up.  With that double entendre  of humor that we all enjoy.  Oh, it's awful.  Hey, Danny, what's up?  Nah.  Danny.  Hello, Danny.  Danny, come on, man.  We're rocking today.  We've got a flow going.  You've got to help us out.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Very good.  All right, you're out, Danny.  You're not talking to me, are you?  Danny. 
[01:26:30]  Is your name Danny?  No, it's Jamie.  Oh, all right.  Jamie.  I don't want to run  through a hotel  looking for you  while a bunny rabbit  blows another man  in another odd costume.  I hear you, man.  Hey, I'm a fourth-day listener,  first-time caller,  probably last time.  Quack, quack.  This shit's way too early, guys.  What?  Too early?  Yeah, you need to flip the script  and do it like  six o'clock evening  to ten at night.  Why?  Why?  What does time have to do  with it, sir?  Oh, shit.  People are just waking up.  You're calling your comedian buddy 
[01:27:00]  still with Morning Wood.  Hell, I don't know.  You can call it.  You can listen to it later.  We replay all day.  That's what's great  about the satellite radio.  It's on like five times.  Oh, hold on.  Sir, what time is it?  Oh, it's like...  For me?  What time is it for me?  Yeah.  4.30 right now for him.  It's 5.30 right now, man.  Where is he called from?  It is too early.  Oregon.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were here.  Wouldn't that be 4.30?  Isn't it 4.30?  I'm just saying all the hotties  are, you know,  they're getting all...  He has no idea what time it is.  All right. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, it's 5.30, man.  Oh.  I think he knows where he is.  How could it be 5.30 in Oregon?  Portland, Oregon.  Or Portland, Maine,  for that matter.  Best damn bartender.  Lloyd?  Yeah.  Hair of the dog that bit me.  We got calls coming from  all over the country today.  Travis, what's up, buddy?  Wyoming, check it in.  Yeah, I was just calling  to say hi to you guys.  I drive a haul truck  out in a coal mine,  and you guys help me  stay awake at, like,  you know, 
[01:28:00]  well, it'd be like 4 a.m. here.  And I was just calling  to say, you know,  I've never heard you guys,  and it's good to hear you.  It's only going to get better,  so tell all your trucking friends  about the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to spread the virus,  all right, bro?  Yeah, we're all hooking up.  We're all getting the XM,  getting your channel,  so it's cool, it's cool.  All right, thank you.  Yep, bye.  Yeah, the truckers  are going to make us huge.  That's a very gay...  That is very obvious.  Very gay-tolerant state, Wyoming.  Are they?  Is that the one  where the guy got...  I believe it is.  ...beaten against the fence post 
[01:28:30]  for his naughty indiscretions?  We need more variety  on this show.  Yeah.  You're taught variety  when you go into radio school.  Right, variety's the spice of life.  Cut, uncut, big, small, thin, thick.  I think we need  a local news break  and talk about the weather  a little bit.  Oh, is that it?  More sports scores would be nice.  That wouldn't be.  Hit the headlines.  What's in the news today?  Does anyone know?  Oh, you looked in the papers?  I see our faces  all over the papers today.  Yeah, that seemed to be big news. 
[01:29:00]  Big news for the  satellite radio industry.  Yeah, Howard's jumping  to satellite radio  and quite honestly,  you know,  I'm really excited about that.  It's great for the industry.  Because it shows everybody  that we weren't wrong.  Simple as that.  We said it.  We said it  a while back, man.  Regular radio blows.  It's time as a real  entertainment medium  is pretty much coming to an end  because you can't...  You have no freedom  on it anymore. 
[01:29:30]  I mean, it'll  it'll be there always  to maybe punch in  your local weather  or traffic  and even, you know,  XM's doing traffic  in the big cities  now anyway.  But, you know,  it'll be there  for something.  I've checked out  the traffic  on the XM satellite.  Yeah.  And it sounds like  you're getting  the marine report.  It's like...  All you need to do  is hear the guy  telling you about the traffic.  They don't have much  bandwidth on those channels yet. 
[01:30:00]  They don't need it.  You just need to know  where you're going, right?  That's it.  But satellite radio  got more gooder today  without a doubt.  And that's why  we're so freaking excited  today, you know?  Absolutely.  A few things  because I'm reading  all the articles  in the paper.  Our name is being mentioned  in all the articles  with Howard.  And a couple things.  Anthony and I  could have gone back  to commercial radio.  A lot of people  are saying in the papers  today that we had  no choice.  That is not true.  We knew we were done  with commercial radio. 
[01:30:30]  We did everything  we wanted to do  on commercial radio.  And we weren't going  to sit there  and do a censored show  with a bullseye  on our foreheads  and having the FCC  coming down on us  every time we got too edgy.  Why would we want  to come back  from two years  of being off  because of the limitations  on what we can do  and then come back  knowing damn well  that we were just  going to get in trouble again?  Not so much  because of the show  we did,  but because of the regulations  that are out there  and the way it's gotten  even crazier.  Can't do anything  on regular radio anymore. 
[01:31:00]  But spin records  and say,  you know,  great,  that was Nickelback.  Would we put a show  on commercial radio?  Definitely.  We could easily do a show  that's entertaining  on commercial radio.  We'll look into those  options eventually.  Yeah.  You know,  the phone started ringing  last night about that,  matter of fact.  So, you know,  we did have the chance  to go back to commercial radio.  We chose not to.  I'm having more fun  radio this week  than I've had  in five or six years.  Yep.  We could talk openly.  It's not about cursing.  You know, 
[01:31:30]  it's about talking  about hand jobs  and this and that  without having to figure  out a way to do it.  You know?  Talking freely  like you speak  with your friends  when you're hanging  out somewhere.  When you're talking  on the CB radio.  That's right.  When you're hanging  out at a bar  with your pals,  you're not sitting there  trying to, you know,  dance around the conversation.  You get right to the point.  This is the way it is  when a bunch of good buddies  just sit around  and talk.  We are a room full  of good buddies.  Hey, good buddy.  We want to be  your good buddy.  No, we don't.  We do.  No, we don't.  I'm a good buddy 
[01:32:00]  and I'm looking  for some more.  No, we don't want  to be good buddies.  But that's, you know,  we're never going to get  a girl into the studio  if you continue  with the good buddy thing.  That's not true.  We do not want  to be good buddies.  We got to pretend  we're gay.  Women love gay guys.  They think that we're fun.  So let's pretend  we're gay.  No.  I think we're doing  a good job  not pretending.  Jesus.  So, yeah,  so that's the deal  with that.  A couple other things  I definitely want  to mention.  Sirius Satellite  wanted Anthony  and I really, 
[01:32:30]  really bad.  Yeah, we had  plenty of meetings  with them.  The day we got fired  for doing our  Sex for Sam stunt,  they were calling  our agent while we're  watching all the  coverage on TV.  They wanted us bad.  They negotiated  with us for a very,  very, very long time.  They hired our staff.  And then when we chose  XM Satellite Radio  over them,  they started trashing  us in the media  like, well,  we kind of had  an interest in,  well, they had an  interest in us  and we listened to them.  No, they were setting  up meetings and suites  in Times Square.  They wanted us  so freaking bad.  But in the end, 
[01:33:00]  both companies  wanted us really bad  and we picked  the better company.  Right.  This XM Satellite Radio  is in better shape  financially.  It's in better shape  programming wise.  It's in better shape  with the technology.  Leaps and bounds.  Their equipment  just blows  Sirius' equipment away.  Go to any Best Buy  or Circuit City,  compare the two.  That's what's embarrassing  for that company over there.  They got their product  right next to XM  and you can't even  compare the two.  No.  So we took this  all into consideration  when we made our decision  and we said,  no, we're going  to XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:33:30]  And those douches  over at Sirius  then start trashing us  acting like,  ah, we really didn't  have much of an interest  in them.  They had more  of an interest in us.  That's bullshit, man.  They know it is.  I like the Sirius unit  just because I like  the idea of an EKG machine.  on my dashboard.  Christ,  could you make that smaller?  They look like  big CB radios  from the 70s.  Yeah, mine does  because I got both  satellite companies  in my car  when we were trying  to figure it out  because we want  to make an educated decision.  Mine does look like 
[01:34:00]  a huge freaking CB radio  on my dashboard.  He puts a hat on it.  I have to put a hat on it  so the undesirables  here in New York  don't take my radios.  But with the XM one  I just pop it out  of the freaking unit  put it in my back pocket  and I'm good to go.  No one's going to  break into my car  to get the unit.  Hey, Ben,  do you think Howard's  going to have to wait  as long as you did  to get paid?  I hope not.  I mean, for his sake,  God.  Especially the money  he makes.  You know,  that's not a good sign  for a company either. 
[01:34:30]  It wasn't just me.  When people that work  for the company  had to wait  six to eight months  to get a paycheck.  And threaten lawsuits  to get their money  and Ben wasn't  making much money  over there.  I'm suing everyone  for pay.  I'll sue you.  I'm still paying back  all my friends.  I didn't get paid  the entire summer  that I worked there.  I just got my check  a few weeks ago.  Jesus.  And I worked there,  you know,  and I'm not doing it  so that's kind of scary.  So good luck.  Well, they had it,  you know,  come on,  now you know why.  They were putting  all the money  in a wheelbarrow  to wheel it over 
[01:35:00]  to Howard.  So we speak the truth  on the show here.  We do?  Oh, we do.  But that's the deal.  We could have went  to either company.  We chose the better company.  We have no doubt  in our minds,  all right?  But it is great  for the industry.  Of course.  It really is.  It's only going  to make us bigger.  People are like,  are you scared?  Of course not.  I'll tell you exactly  what's going on here,  folks.  After I blow my nose.  Go ahead there,  Rob.  Take a second.  Another little toot.  Another little toot  out your nose.  Hark, hark. 
[01:35:30]  Ugh.  That's a moist one.  Here's the deal,  okay?  I'm putting this  on the line.  You put our show  up against Howard's,  we are the funnier show,  the most entertaining show.  We make people laugh.  We care about our listeners.  That's right.  We've integrated our listeners  a long time ago.  We definitely care  about the audience  and we take their feedback.  We're not egomaniacs  over here.  You put our show  up against Howard's,  we will win.  Guaranteed.  The Pepsi Challenge.  Here's the problem.  Howard has a bigger name 
[01:36:00]  than Opie and Anthony.  Yes, we understand that.  Although,  we're getting more  national coverage  again today,  so, you know,  another notch  in the Opie and Anthony  thing here today.  And that's the challenge  for XM.  Right.  They've got to expose  this show  as much as possible  to the rest of  the XM nation  to prove that we are  funnier and more  entertaining than Howard.  And if that happens,  we will win.  Simple as that.  That's the only thing  that's going to prevent us  from being the bigger show  in the end.  That's it.  Right.  That's it.  And if you don't believe me, 
[01:36:30]  trust me,  we worked for the same company,  okay?  It is true.  Howard had a gag order  on Opie and Anthony.  He did not like us  talking about him.  He hates us.  He doesn't like us.  He saw us as a threat,  okay?  He knew we were better.  The company knew  we were better.  That's why we had to  sit out two fucking years  and not do the radio show,  okay?  The company knew  that we would go  across the street  and it was told to me  from a bunch of insiders  at Infinity Broadcasting,  they knew  Opie and Anthony  up against Howard  in New York City, 
[01:37:00]  we would win  in morning drive.  Simple as that.  So what did they do?  They paid Anthony and I,  I'll say it,  and I'm embarrassed  about this  because I don't like  talking money,  they paid Anthony and I  millions of dollars  to sit out  because they were  that scared of us  for two years.  I got like five grand.  Oh.  You guys got paid?  Oh, you didn't know that?  I got paid for a few months  and that was it  for everybody.  You did?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, Mr. Perfect Timing, 
[01:37:30]  getting the boot  like the day  you were supposed  to sign your contract.  No, no, no.  It was just that the guy  who was in charge of it  was busy being tied up  and teabagged  by some large African.  Oh, my God.  I didn't get to it.  Yeah, you didn't.  That cost me a lot of money,  you faggot.  There's a lot of anger here.  Oh, my God.  But there were reasons  why they played hardball  behind the scenes  and shut us up  and won't let us  talk about Howard  and then made us sit out 
[01:38:00]  for two years  and pay us.  Right.  It's not because we do  a bad radio show, folks.  They could have got out  of the contract,  but they chose not to.  We tried to get out  of the contract.  They would not let us  because they did not  want us going up  against Howard  in Morning Drive.  That is a fact.  That's why they sat us out.  So you expose this show  and in the coming weeks  the show's going to get  even better  because we're getting  our sea legs again.  I'm telling you.  Arr. 
[01:38:30]  I got my sea legs.  But these two shows  up against each other.  In the end,  we will win  as long as we have  as much exposure  as he does.  Simple as that.  Simple as that.  Who's going to be left  on regular radio?  Who's the idiot  that's sitting there  on regular radio  thinking it's a good thing?  Man.  And then,  well,  no,  it was there  all the ass wipes  that were too scared  to speak up  when we were getting  fired for doing  something legal  and, you know,  they all thought  it was hilarious  that we were  out of the radio game.  Hey, what's going on?  I'm on regular radio. 
[01:39:00]  Don and Mike,  Bob and Tom,  Man Cow.  Yeah.  All these guys  thought it was hilarious.  Well, look what's  happening to the business,  you idiots.  Let them all go down  with the ship.  As we row away  in those lifeboats,  we watch the flames  shooting out of the stacks  as the band plays on,  as the stern tips  out of the water,  hoo-hoo,  and bow first.  And it kills him.  He slips beneath the surface. 
[01:39:30]  It kills him.  He can't do  an uncensored show yet.  I know.  It really does.  As we're sitting here  speaking our minds  and not taking  20-minute commercial breaks.  That didn't take long.  I'm sure it just took  like a day  of listening to this show  and seeing the freedom  that we have  to discuss anything  must have driven  him crazy.  And plus,  the guy's all about himself.  He doesn't even tell  his own staff  what he's doing.  See, we still have spies  in Infinity Broadcasting.  Oh, we have spies.  I found out the whole deal.  He doesn't even tell  his own crew 
[01:40:00]  what he's about to do.  I would never do that  to Anthony.  Anthony would never  do that to me.  We'd never do that  to anyone around here.  They found out  when everyone else  found out.  Didn't tell anybody.  Got on the air  and, you know,  I'm going to satellite.  Really, Howard?  I had no clue.  Wow, am I coming to both?  And do you really  think it's a coincidence  that he made his announcement  the week we debut  on satellite radio?  Coincidence?  He's a bit scared.  He's trying to, you know,  take the wind  out of our sails. 
[01:40:30]  But with that said,  it's great for satellite radio.  We understand  he does a good show.  We understand  he has a fan base.  We're not stupid.  Wow.  Speak for yourself.  What?  Oh, stupid.  Okay.  I'm stupid?  What?  No, I said  I wasn't stupid.  You're stupid?  Yeah.  That's what I meant.  And thanks for your comments,  Jim.  It was great.  Very refreshing. 
[01:41:00]  I never interrupt  and it's not my place  to interrupt.  I know when to talk.  I know when to shut up.  You can take the duct tape  off your mouth now.  Calm down.  It's okay.  You don't know  when to shut up  and when to talk.  That makes you a fool.  You ever see  Mississippi Burning Man?  Norton just wants  to keep all his options  open always.  I'm just messing  with you, dude.  I don't want the people  to think that, though.  No, I'm messing with you.  Very loyal.  More serious people  checking in  saying how late  their paychecks are.  Oh, there's a ton of them.  And they're taking  a huge gamble.  Huge.  What do you think  the odds are?  Wall Street is already 
[01:41:30]  saying XM Satellite Radio  is still the stock to buy.  Okay?  And, well,  just wait for the technology  that's coming out, people.  Just wait.  Mm-hmm.  That's all I can say  right now.  Just wait.  Okay?  But with that said,  I'm very excited, man.  You know?  And we like the idea  that we were the pioneers,  the innovators,  the first crossovers  of a major show  to Satellite Radio.  And now to see  other people  following suit, 
[01:42:00]  taking, uh...  The key word,  following.  Following.  Following.  Taking our lead  in the industry  and coming aboard.  We welcome you.  We did Satellite Radio, Opie.  We welcome you.  As the pioneers,  we welcome you.  But I do want to say  that I don't know...  More talent coming  to Satellite Radio  is great.  We just welcome you  that you saw it our way.  Yes, Jim?  I, uh...  A quick newsflash,  um,  and this is actually  kind of frightening,  but it's just been said  that, um,  Frank's Place  is now moving  into Sirius Satellite Radio. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Don't.  Oh, poor guy.  Oh, there will be  changes around here.  So there you go.  That's what we have  to say about this.  People are like,  that's what we say now.  Are you guys bummed?  We're not bummed.  We know we do a good show  and we're going to be  just fine.  And there's more people  going to be defecting, too,  to hear the Sirius Satellite Radio.  Everyone's going to get off  commercial radio  because it stinks.  I've done it all over the country  in the last two years  doing gigs.  That's right.  It's awful.  Bondry,  who's going to hire me  the Greaseman show? 
[01:43:00]  Bondry Snarlins,  I'm going to have to launch  my own saddle-a-deedle-lite.  You know how I had to get  a show back on regular radio?  How?  I had to buy  commercial time  like an infomercial  for the Greaseman.  Sell my own commercials.  What I did,  I sold my own spots.  Hey,  I love Danny's Fried Chicken  right at the corner  of Main and 5th Street.  Go down there,  tell them the Greas sent you. 
[01:43:30]  Now I want to get on  satellite radio.  Seems to be where  everybody's going-de-do-ing.  Yeah,  you can do an uncensored show.  But I can't get on  the two companies  that are out there already.  So I'm going to launch  my own Greas-satellite-deedle-deedle-dite.  That's right.  I bought some bottle rockets  and an old AM-FM radio.  And I'm launching it  into outer-de-space.  Are you going to be  slinging lead  on your new show?  Slinging lead-deed. 
[01:44:00]  What I'm going to do  is build a satellite,  hook it up with a chain  to my pickup truck  and drag it around  to Lauryn Hill albums.  Don't her lips look  like big solar panels?  Wad-dee-doo-dee-dee.  You better apologize.  You best be apologizing.  No wonder they bribe a dust.  What did I say?  What the hell is that?  Bone dry,  snarlingsy.  Greas-man-nelly. 
[01:44:30]  When I was slinging lead  with the Washington PD  and then the FBI.  Now I'm going to launch  a saddle-deedle-deedle-deedle-dee.  Get my own satellite radio station.  I'm broadcasting from Venus.  That's where I'll be.  Venus.  Wad-dee-doo-dee-dee.  We'll be back with more  of the Greas-man show  after I get a saddle-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  Holy ass.  Light.  That's good.  That's good.  He might cross over.  You never know, right?  Hey, speaking of satellite radio, 
[01:45:00]  you know, every day  we're trying to do something  you can't do on regular radio.  Yeah.  Brother Joe,  Anthony's brother,  he does a lot of song parodies  for the show.  And I think he's coming in,  isn't he?  Yeah, he's going to be in later.  He's got song parodies  that were just riddled with bleeps  when we had to play them  on regular radio.  Right.  Remember all the fun songs?  And we used to get pissed off  because we'd play them once,  they'd get all dumped out of,  and then we'd have to go back 
[01:45:30]  into the studio,  put beeps where we never imagined  you'd have to put a beep.  You know, they were beeping out  like the word ass.  Stop it.  And now we can play them.  Now we can play the songs  in full.  Waddle-doodle.  I've got to take a break  and figure out why Joel  is text messaging me  during the show, Anthony.  Who?  Joel.  Hmm, interesting.  I don't know why  he would do that now, but...  Huh.  All right, we'll be back  with the O&A show.  I got a job.  I got to take a dump.  I got a job. 
[01:46:00]  I gots a job.  Chubby gals need love, too.  That's quite possibly  the filthiest vagina  I have ever seen.  The O&A show.  And here,  as long as we're talking  about theme restaurants,  I've got a proposition for you.  I think  if white people  are going to burn down  black churches,  then black people  ought to burn down  the House of Blues.  Huh?  What a fucking disgrace  that place is.  The House of Blues.  They ought to call it  the House of Lame  White Motherfuckers. 
[01:46:30]  Inauthentic,  low-frequency,  single-digit,  lame white motherfuckers.  Especially these male movie stars  who think  they're blues artists.  You ever see these guys?  Don't you just want to  puke in your soup  when one of these  fat, balding,  overweight,  over-aged,  out-of-shape,  middle-aged male movie stars  with sunglasses  jumps on stage  and starts blowing  into a harmonica?  It's a fucking sacrilege.  In the first place,  white people  got no business  playing the blues  ever. 
[01:47:00]  At all.  Under any circumstances.  Ever.  ever, ever, ever.  What the fuck  do white people  have to be blue about?  Banana Republic  ran out of khakis?  Huh?  The espresso machine  is jammed?  Hootie and the Blowfish  are breaking up?  Shit,  white people  ought to understand  their job  is to give people  the blues  not to get them. 
[01:47:30]  And certainly  not to sing  or play them.  Tell you a little secret  about the blues.  It's not enough  to know which notes  to play.  You've got to know  why they need  to be played.  And another thing.  I don't think  white people  should be trying  to dance like blacks.  Stop that!  Stick to your  faggoty polkas  and waltzes.  And that repulsive  country line dancing  shit that you do.  And be yourself.  Be proud.  Be white. 
[01:48:00]  Be lame.  And get the fuck  off the dance floor.  Now.  I thank you.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson  with America's Car Show  tip of the day  on XM Radio.  Wayne from Fort Wayne,  Indiana writes,  I own an 87 Ford Mustang GT.  I'm wondering  why the oil pressure gauge  constantly registers low.  Will this have  a negative effect  on my vehicle's performance?  Wayne,  will low pressure 
[01:48:30]  have a negative effect  on your engine performance?  Well, yeah.  And that the engine  could seize up  and stop running  never to run again.  Is that negative  enough for you?  Have an oil pressure test  performed with a  mechanical gauge  to determine if the engine  indeed has low oil pressure  or if it's just due  to a bad oil pressure sensor  or wiring harness to it.  If you do have  low oil pressure,  you could do major  damage to the engine  in the form of  rod or main bearing damage,  crank or cam damage,  cylinder wall damage  or damage to anything else 
[01:49:00]  that needs lubrication.  Got a question?  Check our website  at americascarshow.com.  Hear the full show  on XM Channel 166,  Saturdays, 2 p.m. Eastern.  Spirit is invisible.  It is soundless.  Liquid metal can make you deaf  and your ears might bleed.  It is without texture,  without taste,  without smell.  It is dimensionless,  spaceless,  and timeless. 
[01:49:30]  Channel 42!  Ow, my throat hurts.  Liquid metal,  one of 100 channels  on XM Satellite Radio.  XM 46.  Moments after  the Jimi Hendrix experience  reduced the stage  to ashes  at the Monterey  Pop Festival  in 1967,  it was clear  Jimi's incendiary guitar  playing had finally  converted the American  audience to his  electric vision.  Jimi first took up  the guitar in his  early teens, 
[01:50:00]  religiously jamming  to blues heroes  Muddy Waters  and Robert Johnson.  The Jimi Hendrix experience.  Doc Rats,  XM 46.  Opie and Anthony,  they jerked off  to the Olsen twins  before they were legal.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Enough,  you're mucking down  with the sickness.  Get up,  come on,  get down  with the sickness.  Get up,  come on,  get down  with the sickness.  Open up,  your hate  and the devil  and the mate.  Get up, 
[01:50:30]  come on,  get down  with the sickness.  You motherfucker,  get up,  come on,  get down  with the sickness.  You fuck out,  get up,  come on,  get down  with the sickness.  That this is the  kid that has been  given to me.  This is the Opie and  Anthony show.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Welcome to all the people  that turned on their  XM satellite radios  overnight.  Every day,  the audience growing  slowly but surely.  It's the ONA virus  slowly spreading  across America.  A couple things. 
[01:51:00]  Want to say sorry  for playing another  George Carlin bit.  Who programs  the fucking comedy bits?  A goldfish?  How do you not remember  we heard that  two days ago?  Well, every day  we're fixing problems.  You know,  today we fixed  the microphones.  They sound a lot better.  They sound great.  Yeah.  Jaime took care  of the problem  as far as that goes.  That is really  a big thing too  because that took up  so much of the show 
[01:51:30]  yesterday.  Stupid mic problems.  Yeah, we went with  the Omnis if you're  paying attention at home.  Keeping track at home.  And we solved  another problem.  Norton's got his  XM satellite radio  boom box.  Thank you.  They sent it today.  Megan and Kevin Straley,  thank you both.  You said you would.  And they're trying  to help me.  I couldn't open the box.  I'm such a retard.  You're a mess.  A retard.  Jim, no, you didn't  get that from them.  You got that from Ziggy  at XM411.  Oh, thank you.  That's right.  Ziggy gave me part of it.  So from them,  the subscription  from Ziggy. 
[01:52:00]  Thank you, Ziggy.  Boxes don't open for you  unless you're paying them anyway.  Should have slipped  it a couple of bucks.  Another problem  we solved overnight,  Anthony.  Yes.  You can now get  your official  Opian Anthony  Wow stickers.  Stop it.  Yes.  And for the people  out there that are  just tuning in the show  trying to figure out  everything,  Wow is one of the  greatest radio promotions  ever.  We love the Wow.  We didn't say that.  It's been written that way  in the press.  Basically, you put a  Wow in your car  and if the girls  feel inclined, 
[01:52:30]  they show you  some boobage.  Some boobage.  Exactly.  Hence the  Whip Them Out Wednesday.  It started on a Wednesday  when we were doing  radio in Boston.  Basically,  Ant and I went  to a John Valby show  and I'm sitting there  in the audience  with Anthony  and we couldn't  believe that  Valby was getting  What the F was that?  I hate packaging.  Opening up packages.  What is going on  with packaging these days?  What is going on  with packaging?  You can't open  anything anymore. 
[01:53:00]  Elaine,  I can't open a package.  Without a screwdriver  and some snips.  I don't know what to do.  Hold on,  I was just making a point.  Kramer.  No, I wasn't.  I was just babbling,  wasting time.  I don't know how to do this.  So, yeah,  at the John Valby show  at the end of the show,  Valby got regular girls  just to show their tits.  Yes, that's what he does.  And all of a sudden,  light bulbs went off  in our heads like,  bing, there's something here.  So then we went on the radio  and we discussed that  and we said,  hey, ladies,  it's a beautiful day  if you feel like flashing. 
[01:53:30]  Why don't you flash  your fellow drivers?  And we didn't think  it was going to work.  And then all of a sudden,  guys were calling in,  freaking out.  Girls were calling,  I'm doing it.  Can you see?  No, it's the radio, stupid.  But it worked  and then it slowly grew  from there.  The radio station  we worked for in Boston,  they didn't support it whatsoever.  They actually suspended us  and all sorts of crap happened.  Made us stop doing it.  Made us stop doing it.  But it was too late.  The seed was planted.  The truckers took it  and ran with it  and basically put wow  on the back of their trucks  in the dirt. 
[01:54:00]  People were making  homemade wow signs.  It just got out of control.  And it worked.  And then we came down  to New York.  They supported it for a while  and we got the bumper stickers  made and stuff.  And now, I mean,  here in New York,  you can't walk around  without seeing one  every single day.  Dude, that promotion  is so good.  That promotion is so good  that it never diminished.  I mean, the time  that you guys were off the air,  it never stopped.  It's not something  you have to pound on  every week.  Yeah, you still see it.  After two years  of us being off the air,  there's still plenty  of wow stickers around.  So finally,  you can get your new  XM Satellite Radio 
[01:54:30]  Opie and Anthony  wow stickers.  Yes.  You can go to  opianthony.com.  I guess you just  write in your address  and they're just going  to mail it out to you.  Wow, really?  That easy?  A little section  on the opianthony.com  website.  Yes.  Weren't they going  to take that away  in New York?  I remember hearing  in the last couple  of months at N.E.W.  that there were  complaints coming in  and they were like,  we might want to  discontinue wow  because it's anti-woman.  Yeah, yeah.  It was the end  of the reign of N.E.W.  I remember they were  starting to complain.  John Sykes over there  wasn't a big fan of wow.  Yes, exactly.  Well, John Sykes  is just a brilliant  radio programmer, 
[01:55:00]  obviously,  as his whole freaking  infinity radio division  has fallen down  around him.  They had to go  and hire Joel  to take care of the mess  started.  They're doing great  over there.  I mean, so what?  They lost you.  They lost Howard.  I mean, they still  have a few guys left.  It was us, Mel, Howard.  Yeah, that's really  smart for a company.  Let Mel Karmazin go.  Let Opie and Anthony go  and now let Howard go.  You idiots.  That's good.  Maybe the problem  is with the people  that are running  the radio division.  At least they still  have Earl  for 10 hours a week. 
[01:55:30]  At least they still  have Earl Douglas  for 10 hours a week.  Okay, I'll take over  morning drive  and all of Howard's  markets with the  Black Rock Coalition.  I'll give picture  hanging lessons.  That'll be the  6 to 7 o'clock hour.  Then I'll talk about  how you get lost  in the van  during a sticker stop.  Oh, I hope I have  time left after that.  I understand Sumner  held a big meeting  and he said,  I don't care who  leaves as long  as that golfer stays. 
[01:56:00]  I want that golfer  that wears the black hat  and sits around  for eight hours a day  doing nothing.  I want him to have  his own gig.  Truckers are scratching  their head going,  what?  Black Earl?  But the people that got it  really got it  and they're laughing  hard right now.  And those who didn't  get it will eventually  catch on.  Earl's a friend of the show.  He always dresses in black  and he's a lazy golfer  but he's a good guy.  Hey, by the way,  John Sykes has some  less than desirable ideas.  I believe he needs  to be corrected. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, they're ready  to correct him.  A golfer cook.  He's just writing out  a contract  before they show him  the door.  That's all that's about.  A golfer?  They already took  all his responsibilities  away.  I remember we saw him  we were at the  Dennis Leary roast  we were backstage.  Remember at the buffet  I was right next to him  and remember he ran away  like a little girl?  Yeah, Ope was fuming  he wanted to say  something awful to him.  I'm like, come on man  I want to get a picture  at Leary.  Oh, you thought  we were going to  get kicked out?  Yeah.  Oh my god, 
[01:57:00]  that brings up  a great story.  Me and Florentine  got you so bad.  You know how he's  into the whole  celebrity photo thing?  Into?  No, he's obsessed  with it.  He's a lunatic  and it's like  he's stalking  celebrities just to  get a picture  next to one  of these celebrities.  Not true.  Whenever I happen  to see one,  I saw Jeffrey Jones  in the street recently.  The principal  from Ferris Bueller's  Day Off.  Oh.  And I was going to  get over.  Isn't he a kid toucher?  That's pedophile.  That's why I regret  not asking him.  At least I should have.  I don't want a picture 
[01:57:30]  of you.  Can I just have a photo  of your hard drive?  But anyway,  you were going to say  something better?  No.  No, it's just  Jim's unbelievable.  I told him the other day  how I saw McCartney  on the street.  He's like,  you didn't stop  and get a picture  with him?  Dude, he's one of the Beatles.  So leave him alone.  Who cares?  Look, he shouldn't be  walking around.  He's a Beatle.  I know.  You would have ran  right up to him.  I would have kicked  his wife's phony leg  out to get a picture.  Remember the time  we got off the plane  from Buffalo  and Junior Soprano  was on the plane 
[01:58:00]  and Jim went running  off.  Junior.  Yeah, he went running  after him.  He got your photo  with Junior.  I got a great,  it's a great shot.  And it's funny.  Take a picture quick.  I got the ass cancer.  Tony, I need to go  to Dr. Kennedy.  It's funny you should  mention that one  because I got another  one of those guys.  He probably looked at  Jimmy and went,  I have the cancer too.  I understand.  You're on the chemo.  You should go to  Dr. Kennedy.  He's a good doctor.  Good ass doctor.  What do you got  a picture of?  Who is that?  I can't see from here. 
[01:58:30]  He says it's big pussy  but he's just got a picture  of his giant lips.  I got big pussy too.  Yeah, and Norton  gets so excited.  He's excited  with his celebrity photos.  I got this on the way  to L.A.  He's got the kid.  Let me see.  Oh yeah, there you go.  It's Christopher.  I'm the Sopranos.  No, this is really  great for radio.  I know.  Passing around pictures.  Thanks for sharing  with everybody.  Show the audience, Jim.  Yeah, why don't you  show that?  Hold it up to the microphone.  Hey look, I'll put it  on eatabullet.com  or maybe jimnorton.blogspot.com  I'll put it on.  He's good.  I'll also be bringing this 
[01:59:00]  to the Palace Theater  tomorrow night in Albany  if you want to take a look at it.  Oh, is that where you'll be?  Yes, I didn't want to mention it.  Alright.  So anyway, we're at  the Dennis Leary roast  about a year and a half ago  I guess at this point  and I'm hanging out  with Florentine  and it's a long time  and Norton's running around  getting celebrity photos  with Victoria Sutherland.  Kiefer Sutherland.  Kiefer.  Not Kiefer.  Kiefer.  I can't talk yet.  Give me a break.  Kiefer.  Victoria.  I know.  Victoria Gotti.  Brian Kieff.  Kiefer the Cop. 
[01:59:30]  I'm so done now.  Thanks.  You couldn't give me a break  with this clogged nose.  Thanks.  I'm sorry.  I really appreciate it.  Kiefer the Cop.  The Strokes were there.  The band.  Who else did you get that day?  I also got Elizabeth Hurley.  Oh, she was horrified.  Oh, Phil Esposito.  Yeah, oh, she wanted  to spit in my face.  I don't doubt it.  She gave the fake smile  as soon as the picture was taken.  She went back to frowning  and pretty much  bit the hell away from me.  Yeah, sorry, Cookie. 
[02:00:00]  I'm not a good enough guy  to get blown by a chick  named Divine or whatever  while I'm dating you.  So we saw her  didn't get a $30 Hummer  while you were my girlfriend.  I'm so glad Hugh Grant did that.  He showed her exactly  how replaceable she is.  20 bucks and a pair of black lips.  There you are,  you snooty whore model.  Take a walk for yourself.  Bye-bye now.  All you're starving yourself,  all you're prancing down the run  way,  how did I do that, boss?  You did a good job. 
[02:00:30]  Here's 20.  Now get out of the car.  I hope I made you feel real good.  Damn, damn, damn, James.  James.  James.  That's how replaceable you are,  snooty whore.  Wow.  Good for him.  So he's running around the room  like a little kid  getting all his photos taken  and me and Florentine  are checking this out.  I'm like,  we gotta get him.  So there was this black guy  that kind of looked like  he could be an actor or whatever.  And he was wearing  a white ruffle shirt  and this weird,  almost like, 
[02:01:00]  what are those things called?  Cumberbun?  It looked like a giant  cummerbund girdle.  It was a very bizarre outfit  like a martial artist would wear.  And he's talking to a couple  hot chicks and stuff  so Florentine and I,  we decide,  let's get Jim really good.  So we go up to Jim  and we go,  dude,  that guy's,  I forgot what show he said.  The next new action star?  He's like a big action star.  Like, really?  Yeah,  he's filming a movie  on the Hamptons  and he's done some roles  on like NYPD Blue  or whatever,  made up a few shows.  So you didn't even try  to sell that he was  a major celebrity?  No, we're saying, 
[02:01:30]  like he's on the way up  big time  and they're filming  this movie in the Hamptons  and we're like,  I forgot the name  of the movie  but I think The Rock  is in it too.  We're just like BSing, right?  His name is Mike  or something?  Yeah, we're going,  I think his,  we know his first name's Mike  but I can't,  do you know his last name,  Jim?  And, you know,  the Florentine,  Florentine,  I can't,  but I know it's Mike, right?  He gets so freaking excited.  He goes up to the guy  while he's talking  to the hot chicks  and starts pulling on his sleeve  and going,  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.  And he's not answering  because his name's not Mike.  His name's not Mike.  And he's pulling on his sleeve, 
[02:02:00]  Mike, Mike,  can I get a photo?  And the guy turns around like,  yeah, alright, whatever.  Did he get a picture with you?  Yeah, and the guy's like,  yeah, I guess.  And we flashed,  we flashed the picture  and at that point,  Florentine and I  are on the floor  and we're laughing so hard  and that's when  Norton knew we got him  really, really bad.  You should have seen the look.  I would have been better off  saying,  here's a plate of sickle cell  for you, sir.  How'd you like a plate  of the old sickle cell?  Oh, it was classic.  It was classic. 
[02:02:30]  And then,  and then,  recently,  about a month,  two months ago,  I got a picture  with President Clinton.  Yes.  Oh, I called up Jim immediately  because he's all about  getting the ultimate  celebrity photo.  I'm like,  yeah,  I'm like,  beat that one.  What's the ultimate  for you, Jim?  Who would be one of the ones  that you really would like?  The original kiss I got,  that was one,  except it wasn't Ace.  It was Gene Peter Paul  in makeup and the new Ace.  So I want Ace really.  Ozzy Osbourne was the ultimate.  The ultimate, though,  would be Richard Pryor.  Of all the ones I've ever met.  Oh, you better hurry up.  I know, 
[02:03:00]  he's very sick.  I got an autograph years ago.  I only met him once,  but that's the ultimate  for me to be Pryor.  You got one with Rodney,  huh?  Yes,  with you guys.  Thanks to you guys.  Oh, that's right.  We got Rodney.  We had him in our studio.  He was already,  oof,  on the way out.  We gave him nothing  but respect.  You have to.  We knew he was  not all there.  Mad respect in your words,  Opie.  Mad respect, yo.  Mad respect, yo.  Yeah, we showed him  a lot of love, dog.  That's right, yo.  Remember when I asked you  if you had cheddar  to pay the parking guy?  Cheddar. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah,  when Opie tries using  any kind of black lingo,  it just doesn't wash, man.  No.  And he was,  yeah.  And you got any cheddar?  We were getting our cars  and there was some,  you know,  there was some  colored folk down there.  You got some change  of a provolone?  And I remember the guy  looked at me  after I said that to you  and he was just laughing  like,  look at the white boy  trying to be black.  Doesn't work.  Well, we just learned  that word that day  on the show.  I figured I'd try it  out on the street.  Okay, you're very Aryan.  You look, 
[02:04:00]  you're Hitler's dream.  You're a blonde-haired,  blue-eyed,  with the little V  going down to the groin area,  strapping young Aryan.  Don't, you don't need  to talk black.  Just be who you are.  Just needs that.  Funny Helmet  and the Potato Masher Grenade.  Wow.  Wow.  Yes.  Hitler's dream right there.  Oh, he really is  tall and slender.  Communicating.  Let's say hi to Sharon.  She's in Arizona.  What's up, Sharon?  Hi, guys. 
[02:04:30]  I got cut off yesterday,  so I wanted to finish  telling you about...  There might have been  a reason why  we cut you off yesterday.  What happened?  We'll soon find out here.  Go ahead.  It was only like,  it was only like  a two-minute thing  and you were like,  what happened?  And I think that  the phones just dropped.  Oh, remember?  She got cut off.  Oh, okay.  I remember that.  I'm telling you that  I am surprised  you don't have  a bigger female audience.  I mean,  it's going to take  a certain kind of person  like the Reservoir Dogs,  you know, females.  But I think that  you guys are great  and I just wanted to...  Yeah, there was a reason 
[02:05:00]  why she got cut off.  Was there?  Yeah.  No, I want to hear  what she has to say.  All right, go ahead, Sharon.  Go ahead.  Oh, well, I wanted to,  first of all, ask  who's the Lindsay Lohan fan  in there?  What?  What's that?  Who's Lindsay Lohan?  I don't know.  She looked pretty hot  on SNL when she hosted.  She got them big...  I gotta tell you,  you gotta check out  Mean Girls.  I mean, you'll never see  Lindsay Lohan.  She's adorable.  Yeah, she looks great in it.  I mean, it's definitely,  it's definitely worth seeing  if you're a big fan.  Boring!  Can I tell you something?  Not to interrupt, 
[02:05:30]  but Susan Smith's kids  had a better time in the van  than I'm having  listening to this story.  Okay.  A little fun ride  down the boat ramp.  Why is mommy getting out  while the engine's running?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Jim.  Help, police!  A golfer took my children!  Jim.  You're not doing a very good job  keeping your female audience.  Jim, we need every listener we got.  I'm not not for her.  We don't have much of an audience yet.  Do you understand that?  I apologize.  I apologize.  I was just trying to be funny.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to, 
[02:06:00]  go ahead,  I'll diss you.  What I really wanted to tell you  was that the whole thing  with Howard Stern,  he's going to have to go to Sirius,  obviously,  because you guys are on,  you know,  XM,  and it's a little bit like  HBO and Showtime.  I mean,  HBO is always going to  eclipse Showtime.  You know what?  He's such a baby  that he didn't want to work  for the same company as us.  That's all that this comes down to.  It's pretty odd.  So he picked the worst,  the worst company out of the two.  That's how much of a baby this guy is. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah,  it's Sirius is not,  I don't know that Sirius is going to survive,  but it's like when cable,  you know,  television first started  and HBO is the innovator on,  you know,  on the paid channels.  All right,  she made her point.  Oh,  she was cut off again.  You didn't want to get to the Showtime part again.  She made her point.  She's actually good,  though.  I'm glad she called in.  Look,  I'm sorry I was teasing you.  I didn't mean anything by it.  Sure you did.  Ask anyone on Wall Street,  the two companies,  as we sit here,  October 04,  it's not even,  it's not even a competition,  okay? 
[02:07:00]  They have a fraction  of the audience over there.  Fraction?  They got,  I think,  I think,  I'm going to be kind,  I think they're almost  at 600,000 subscribers.  Hey,  there you go.  XM's got 2.5,  going to hit three  by the end of the year,  at least three million.  Mm-hmm.  And they're on track  to do what?  20 million by 2010.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey,  look,  I don't like to be,  see Sirius knocked.  You want to buy  a couple of shares,  buy three shares  of their stocks,  unless,  of course,  you had your eye  on a pack of cigarettes,  then buy that instead. 
[02:07:30]  $3.50 a share.  Fucking whole building  should burn down.  Wow.  Idiots.  You mean it went up  a little bit?  Well,  no,  I think it's really cool  to have the NFL,  because people are home  watching it on Sunday.  Nobody listens to football  on the radio.  Nobody.  Unless you're driving  to the store  to pick up some beer  to take it back  to your big screen television.  Oh,  my God.  Or you might listen  for a couple of minutes.  Baseball is one thing.  Or if you can't get  in the sports bar  around the corner  from your house.  Right. 
[02:08:00]  Or if you don't have  like the dish in your house  with your 50 friends,  they're all going to pile  into your Chevette  and listen,  so maybe your fat whore wife  can put chips  in the passenger seat.  I like these announcers  a little better.  Idiots.  Let's listen to football.  Nobody listens to football.  Baseball,  you have to.  There's 162 games.  Football,  there's 16 on a Sunday.  everybody's home.  Right.  Everyone's home.  Good point.  You make a very valid point. 
[02:08:30]  And there's going to be  a nice satellite delay.  So if you want to watch it,  you can actually listen  15 seconds later  just in case your eyes  didn't catch what happened  right in front of you.  Always want a sports show  delayed by 15 seconds  when you're watching  and listening to the radio.  Just in case you're like,  that was a great play.  Turn the volume down.  I'd like to hear it.  Assholes.  Oh, man.  God, we have energy today.  Nobody can even pronounce  the name of that stupid company. 
[02:09:00]  Psoriasis?  Yeah, it's a skin disease.  That's what it's called.  It's kind of like serious  but not spelled with an E-R-I-O-U-S.  It's I-R-I-U-S.  Psoriasis.  Half the country is illiterate.  Why don't you put a silent P-H  in it, you fucking morons?  Little dog.  Arf, arf.  Little dog.  What is the little dog for?  Look at it.  One's looking one way,  one's looking the other way.  Exactly.  Here's the guy holding a satellite 
[02:09:30]  and a big check going,  what do you want from me?  Hey, he looks familiar,  doesn't he?  He looks just like the guy.  Poor thing got its nose  caught in a grill.  Psorias.  Little dog.  Little dog for a model.  Maybe you should get  little dogs out of the vents.  Oh, man.  Holy ass, that is funny. 
[02:10:00]  Oops.  Oh.  Yeah.  Maybe that's the next thing  we can work on.  Yeah, we'll work on that.  I like the mic nice and squeaky  because it actually keeps  them nice and stiff.  It really does.  I hate when they droop  because I stand.  You guys can't see in the studio.  Opal stand occasionally.  Ant always sits.  Yeah.  You know, and it's just,  all right, God, am I boring?  Who gives a shit?  No, you're killing.  Jessica.  I just caught myself.  Hey, Jessica, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to say welcome back.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  And I also wanted to see 
[02:10:30]  if you could give me  a little help.  I've had a wow sticker  in my car since the days  of the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes.  I have never seen  a kid on the road.  I just thought maybe  you could ask  for some help for me.  Well, where are you  driving right now?  I'm in Long Island  on Marcus Avenue  on my way to work.  Are you going to be driving  by 57th Street at all  in New York?  No, I'm not.  I work on Long Island.  It's like fishing  is what it is.  You just got to keep 
[02:11:00]  the line in the water  and hope you get a nipple.  Good, good analogy.  That's it.  I was thinking  it's more like fishing.  You got to take  your pregnant wife  out in the bay  in San Francisco  and put chains on her  and then go home  and have sex  with your aerobic girlfriend.  Oh, a little blonde hair  on the boat.  That kind of gave it away,  didn't it, Scotty boy?  That little fishing expedition.  Sure.  Two for the price of one.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Little gassy bodies  floating to the top.  Two less presents 
[02:11:30]  for Christmas.  Did you have the room  painted blue?  Did you, Scott?  I love Scott Peterson.  Oh, is he an arrogant man?  He's an arrogant dude.  He's going to get off, too, you know.  No, I don't think so  because they caught him lying  and everybody knows he did it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You can't depend on the jurors anymore.  But there's some dumb woman,  some dumb broad  will marry him.  Like Richard Ramirez,  the Night Stalker,  who bludgeoned old women  with a lamp.  I mean, sure,  that's great fodder  for a Saturday Night Live bit, 
[02:12:00]  but why would you marry that guy?  There's a woman that showed up  in jail to marry him.  And you wonder  why guys are abusive.  Yep.  And Scott Peterson  has that Ben Affleck look,  so the women kind of like him.  Except his movies are better.  I was in Daredevil.  Yeah, were you really  a compulsive gambler dullard?  I'm so tired of him.  Did one goodwill,  at least Matt Damon  did some interesting choices  and took some risks.  He didn't like Armageddon?  Oh, that, 
[02:12:30]  it was,  I was actually,  even though I'm on the planet,  I was rooting for us  all to be killed  so I wouldn't have to see  the end of that shitty film.  Oh, did that bug me?  I like Liv Tyler,  though.  I actually do like,  I don't want to like Liv Tyler,  but I do like her  because I think  she's actually very good.  I think she was hotter  in the videos,  the Aerosmith videos  when they first came out.  Because something  happened with her  and she has the biggest feet.  You ever see her feet?  They're like  a foot and a half long. 
[02:13:00]  Why would you,  I wouldn't even know  if she had them.  Hey, you know something?  Because when I'm looking  at a girl,  I like the whole package.  I got,  it's like from head to toe,  you kind of take everything  into consideration.  And her big feet  are a little distracting.  You know?  Guys with foot fetishes  actually,  guys with foot fetishes  like big feet.  It's not a foot fetish.  No, no, no,  I'm saying,  but guys like big feet.  Like, I think foot fetishes  are weird.  You know,  I don't get it,  but a foot being part  of the whole woman,  unless you're hacking  them to pieces.  You know,  unless you're a Boston nanny 
[02:13:30]  in a dumpster.  Unless you're an ex-Beatle  just watching your wife  swim in circles  because she can't quite  kick, can she?  I like when you swim  like that,  around in a circle,  around and around  she goes.  Train the pool,  my wife can't get out.  She's just swimming.  She's going around  in circles.  Look at her go.  Keep kicking, sweetheart.  There she goes.  Look, 
[02:14:00]  she's making a whirlpool.  I mean,  there's a real  amputee fetish,  though, man.  A foot fetish,  I really believe  it's about submission  and it's about like,  you know,  people don't know  why they have it,  but I think  that a little boy  sees mommy's tootsies  and he gets a little tent  in his granimals  and he always makes  that association  of the foot being sexy.  You think?  Absolutely,  because I don't mind  the smell of a foot  if I have a good  chemistry with a girl  or I'll suck your toes, 
[02:14:30]  but it's not a  submissive thing for me.  Some guys just want  to suck boots  and all that stuff.  It does nothing for me,  but it's about submission.  I don't know.  I don't think  there's ever been  anything that I've  looked at as I was  a young boy  on my mommy  that I use in any  way, shape, or form  as a sexual thing.  But you're a more  normal guy.  Thank you.  You don't whack off  looking at Toad.  My friend Kenny  was into that.  He liked to be spanked  and he would get  foot magazines  and just show me  pictures of painted toes.  Foot magazines.  Oh, it's like,  Jesus, do it.  I like the foot 
[02:15:00]  as part of the whole package  and it's got to be  an attractive foot  or a cute foot  or something like that.  It can't be a big foot.  It's big with these  corns on the side of them  and ingrown nails  and stuff,  big yellow fungus nails.  You know,  that'll turn,  even if the chick's hot,  that's a complete turn off.  You know?  Yeah, a nice bunion  on the side  that looks like  a neck goiter.  You ever see  an alcoholic  with a neck goiter?  Just want to grab it  and squeeze it  until his head falls off.  Our doorman  at the building  we used to live in  in Brooklyn, 
[02:15:30]  this little guy  named Yubi,  he looked like  Schmeagle.  Yeah,  he was awful,  this awful little guy  and he had  this goiter  on the back  of his neck  that was as big  as his fucking head.  It was just  a spider  that bandaged  as big as your fucking head.  It was  right on the back  of his neck  and he used to wear  wife beater shirts  and he was about  about four feet tall  and it was disgusting.  You walk past him  and I'd have to  like shield my eyes 
[02:16:00]  as I walked  into my building.  Yeah,  it was Quato.  He had Quato  growing out of his neck.  What happened  to his goiter?  Did they slice it off  and it got a job  at XM Radio  spinning Sinatra CDs?  There's a human goiter  cock blocking our fun.  That will be  taken care of though.  I like a tired  Jim Norton.  It was awful.  Much more gooder.  I only got like  four hours last night.  Really?  I'm trying to stay up.  I'm trying to do it. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah,  I can't figure it out.  One of these days.  We'll figure it out  together as friends,  as a team,  as good buddies.  We're not good buddies.  Stop with that.  Okay,  Brother Joe's here.  Anthony's brother.  Big feet  equals big slit.  I had no clue.  Thank you.  I don't know about that sir  if that's necessarily true,  but I prefer it actually.  By the way,  that girl Jen,  if I can.  Who wants a big slit though?  I do.  Not a big awful slit,  but a big droopy.  He likes it to be plump down there. 
[02:17:00]  When you're laying on your back,  it should look like a Scooby-Doo sandwich.  That's what I like.  A big stacked disaster.  That is an awful slit.  That is an awful slit.  I like a packed,  just packed.  He likes it nice and messy down there.  I really do.  Just meaty.  Meaty.  Didn't you once say  you like it to look like  an elephant's trunk or whatever?  Yeah,  yeah,  like Mr. Ed's lips.  Just dangling and awful.  I like it like a clamshell.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be nice and tight like that.  I don't like the ones that,  oh,  you see some of these  like over 40 magazine 
[02:17:30]  or something like that?  It looks like someone  threw a Philly cheesesteak  on the floor.  Big meat.  Just big meat curtains.  You don't know where  it's coming from.  Yeah,  you have no idea  where it's coming from  or what it's growing out of  or something.  I don't like that.  They should be meat curtains,  but not only meat curtains,  I want them to be  floor to ceiling  and room darkeners.  And motorized.  You punch them in the face,  they just open.  Big droopy pieces  of silly putty  that are picking up comics 
[02:18:00]  out of the Sunday paper.  You could stretch  Snoopy's face on them.  Look at that.  That's what I like though.  Big fat ones.  We all have our  little different tastes.  Sure.  Yours disturbed me,  but it's different.  I wish I had yours.  They're much more healthy.  Yours are healthier  and more normal.  I wish I had them.  I don't like a lot  of discoloration either.  I never notice.  Like that one old clam  you get when you order  the clams  where it's hanging  off the side  of the shell.  It's black around the edges.  A little discolored,  a little purple.  Like that purplish hue.  A little purplish brown 
[02:18:30]  falling off the side  of the shell  as you're trying to eat  your clams on the half shell.  You go from a nice woman  to all of a sudden  Mom's Mabley is down there.  What happened?  I like a vagina  that looks like  Hedon Nussbaum.  That's what I like.  Oh, God.  Just a black eye  and a droopy face.  Beaten senseless.  I like one that looks  like it's got Bell's palsy.  Right.  Drooping and drooling.  Talking with a flur.  Oh, I like a cleft pussy. 
[02:19:00]  Hey, quit licking me.  Hair lip.  Wow.  Hey, Sex Bagel,  clear all the phones  and see what else  we got going on, all right?  Clear the field.  Some men are going  to do some drinking.  You want to do  Brother Joe songs next?  Sure.  Uncensored.  Uncensored Brother Joe songs.  That'll be a first.  This is what's great  about satellite radio.  I remember getting  more dump time  than air time  over at the other place. 
[02:19:30]  That's right.  And it looks like  you've made some new songs  since we've been  off the radio.  Oh, sure.  You got a song  about SARS?  Oh, yeah.  I'm a busy man.  I'm reading his titles  here, Anthony.  Lucky Charms,  the C word song.  Yes.  Ooh.  Unbeeped.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  We had a beeple letter.  Dry Vagina, nice.  Ah, remember we couldn't  play that because  it described the vagina?  The word vagina was fine.  You just couldn't  describe that it was dry.  The funniest part  about that was  you guys,  I gave you like  five copies of it  and every time  they took the CD away 
[02:20:00]  you'd have another one.  Yeah.  And then they kept  dumping out of it though.  Why couldn't you  describe the vagina  as dry?  Why?  It doesn't matter anymore.  We don't have to worry  about those rules.  That's what I like.  You're right.  That's right.  The lawyers used to tell us  though, you can talk about it  but you can't describe it  in any way.  So you can't say dry,  you can't say pretty,  you can't say stinky,  you can't, you wouldn't  let us describe it.  No adjectives.  Right.  Because lawyers have  good comedy input.  I mean, they really,  they know what  being funny is all about.  When you throw comedy  through that lawyer filter, 
[02:20:30]  you know funny's coming  out the other end.  Going to get squeezed out  in a perfect comedic gem  that's friendly  and fun for the whole family.  And can't be litigated over.  Nice.  Repulsive people.  That's what we're looking for.  Safety.  Hey Steve, we don't have  a George Carlin bit  queued up, do we?  God, I hope not.  Oh, God.  And we love Carlin.  If they were playing  different Carlin bits,  this would be the greatest gig ever.  But how about  different Carlin bits?  I don't want to hear  that it's timed out.  It's satellite.  We do an extra 30 seconds.  Who's looking?  Let's not hear the  Burn Down the House of Blues 
[02:21:00]  one again.  As brilliant as that is.  I know, very funny.  Carlin's a genius.  You know, how many times  can you hear it?  I've got to bring in  the audio of me and him  doing Tough Crowd someday.  My proudest moment in comedy.  Can we put on  Gallagher smashing  the watermelon?  Ooh, I like that.  All the golfers  are going crazy.  He's wasting it.  You're the bootleg  of Gallagher too.  Yeah, Gallagher too,  his brother.  Come on,  smash his watermelon.  All right, well,  let's see what they got  for us here.  Ah! 
[02:21:30]  Shut your mouth!  I say I shut  your fucking mouth!  I masturbated so hard,  I almost broke my vagina.  Thump.  Ah!  The O.D.  Anthony Show.  Yeah, you need  a driver there, buddy.  Who's this?  This is Jake,  calling about the job,  driving, I saw it in the paper.  Yes.  Yeah, well,  you still need a driver or what?  Uh, did you feel  an application with us, Jake?  Pardon me?  Huh?  Speak up there,  what did you say? 
[02:22:00]  You feel an application with us?  No, no, no, no.  Look, I saw the ad in the paper  and I'm calling you,  fruitcake.  I'm looking for a job  driving a truck.  We're looking for movers.  Yeah, well,  that's what I do.  What class driver's license  do you have?  I got five,  one, two, three,  four,  I got them all.  Yeah, class one?  Yeah, I drive buses,  trucks,  I'll back a truck  through the fucking, uh,  two-family house garage.  One of those big  two-ton trucks.  When was the last time  you drove a truck  to a trailer?  Oh, jeez,  what the fuck?  I'd say about two weeks ago 
[02:22:30]  I robbed one down in Jersey  and I drove it up here  to New York.  Fucking flying.  Drove it through the tolls,  no stopping,  no nothing.  I'm good.  Why don't you call,  uh,  call back on Monday?  Hey,  I'll tell you what,  I come in,  I'll take you for a test spin.  How's that?  We go out  and we take the truck  around the fucking block.  I speed,  I pop wheelies,  I'm good, baby.  Go back on Monday,  I'll talk.  All right,  can I get you?  I want you.  You sound good,  you and me,  we make a team,  you drive with me.  All right? 
[02:23:00]  What's your name again?  Jake.  Hey,  who did you work for,  Jake?  Oh, jeez,  I worked for Moish,  I worked for,  uh,  Mape Flower,  you know?  Oh, yeah,  don't,  hey,  I was good with them,  too.  You worked with Moish's?  Yeah,  that's right.  When?  Eh,  about,  what,  two years ago?  See,  when I got a problem there,  they get fucking scared  when I pop the wheelies  and all that shit.  You know,  I pop a lot of wheelies,  I'm good with that shit.  You know,  I don't break no merchandise,  see it,  I get it there two hours  ahead of time,  all the time.  What do you say?  Say,  if you pop any wheelies there, 
[02:23:30]  I'm not even gonna put it in your position.  Listen to me,  I don't break nothing,  sizzle chest,  I'm good.  Okay,  call Monday,  we'll set up an interview,  okay?  All right,  I'll do that there,  Rubberneck,  I'll call you Monday.  Okay.  All right,  fruitcake,  see you later.  Where the Surfers Go,  next is SpamSlicer.com  presents Megabyte Minute.

[02:25:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  It's Anthony.  I don't know where Opie went.  He just kind of took off.  It happens.  Maybe he had to  relieve himself.  The breaks really,  really don't give us  enough time to do anything.  Anything bodily related.  Whether that's  putting stuff in it  or getting stuff out of it.  He cut one and left.  Yeah, I know.  Thank you for that.  Thank you for that, Opie.  I like how you cut one 
[02:26:00]  and then just left the studio.  Oh my god.  Now he's limping.  He looks sick.  He's limping.  It's like his own stuff  is causing him  shrapnel damage.  We're going to have to  take one long break.  I got it.  Crap.  Well, maybe we can play  George Carlin  Burn Down the House of Blues  and then right after that  play Jerky Boy's  Truck Driver.  Did they do that again?  Yes.  Yes, of course they did.  What the hell?  Look, we love being at XM 
[02:26:30]  but everyone's got to get  on the same page with us.  Please.  You've got to do your own breaks.  There's a million great  comedy bits out there  from comedians we love  that we would love to  share with our audience.  I want to hear Brian Regan.  I want to hear some Brian Regan.  But it's a timing problem  or something.  How about a song once in a while?  Mix it up a little.  Let people just not be sure  it's going to be played.  How is it a timing problem  by the way?  Yeah, because the breaks  have to be timed out to  No, they don't.  Four minutes or something?  No, they don't.  So then let's just start playing.  We should play our own. 
[02:27:00]  Our show should be  four hours of whatever  we want to put in it  whenever we want to put it in.  So if we want to take a break  that's five minutes long  we will go to the CD player  drop something in  or if it's on the Dillette system  drop something in  play it up here  up here  everything originates from here  and then when we're ready  to come back  we come back  and we're back  and we know what was played  during the break  because we played it.  Yeah, we can make those breaks  so much better.  There's no reason 
[02:27:30]  Washington should have to  import anything up here  because this is the system  that's in place  we've got to change the system.  Yeah, man.  We've got to change  the system, man.  Let your freak flag fly, man.  Yeah.  We're learning about each other  obviously.  We're learning about the company  they're learning about us.  I'm telling you  we know comedy  we know comedy albums.  That's right.  And we can put together  some great, great comedy bits  until the sponsors come aboard.  Yeah.  Then, you know,  we've got to organize 
[02:28:00]  a little more  as far as time goes  but now?  But I thought we had  this problem solved already.  Mm-mm.  We talked about that.  It's not solved.  The problem doesn't get solved.  Well, that's too bad.  It's your fucking wife.  It's your wife, isn't it?  Whatever the fuck she is.  Who's that from?  Spinal Town.  I was still part of that.  I never saw the whole thing.  Oh, very funny.  But we need to take  a long break  because I gotta,  I gotta,  I gotta,  you know,  I gotta squeeze.  Squeeze again?  I tried.  Just nuggets are popping out.  Again, what happens? 
[02:28:30]  Oh.  Little healthy nuggets.  Milk dud.  Milk duds.  Plink.  Plink.  And you know what?  My gut is percolating.  So it wants to happen.  I need to be in that  flaxseed oil.  Every day,  one shot of flaxseed oil.  Just keeps the machine lubricated, man.  Someone said,  have a cup of coffee  and a cigarette.  That'll do the job.  That's the old school way  of getting that done.  And then someone said,  just go to White Castle.  That's true.  Yeah, that takes a while though  and that'll just  clog you up even more.  It gives you the ass polyps. 
[02:29:00]  What's the burger place  in New York?  They're the best burgers  in the world.  They have like  a hundred different versions.  But these things  go through you.  I mean,  you're barely done eating  and you have to...  Jackson Hole?  Jackson Hole burgers.  What's that?  They're all over the...  Well, they were all over the city.  I don't know.  I haven't seen any lately.  Maybe they all closed down  because everyone was blasting  the burgers out their butt  minutes after eating them.  I've never even heard of it.  I've never heard of the place.  Oh, they have every burger  you could imagine.  Every combination of burger.  You want Phospho Soda  by the fine people 
[02:29:30]  that made your enema products.  Fleet.  Yeah, that's what you want.  A soda from an enema company.  Yeah.  It's got a little straw  built into it  you have to shoot in your mouth.  Hold it in  and then swiggle around  and swallow it.  No, thank you.  All right,  before we get to Joe's songs...  I think wordplay stuff is funny.  We do no comedy.  Like, if you say  the enema soda thing,  I'll go,  yeah, it tastes like crap.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know,  that type of stuff,  that's good natured fun.  Hey, Luke, 
[02:30:00]  what's going on today, buddy?  Hey, what's up, y'all?  Hey.  Yeah, I was listening  the other night  and y'all were talking  about the pickled punk  or whatever.  I think that there's  something to that.  Y'all were saying  that it was cursing y'all  or something.  Well, it cursed me, I think.  I'm returning the pickled punk  tomorrow on the show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think Andy Gore's  coming in tomorrow  to take his pickled punk back.  He's not bringing  anything with him, is he?  I don't know.  We'll have to wait and see,  I guess.  Serving items.  Acting lesson,  dancing lesson.  I was going to make him  a big star.  He was the best pickled punk 
[02:30:30]  I've ever had  and I've had him  all over the world.  Now you get the hell  out of here.  My crap Mc friend.  I'm a punk and I'm pickled.  Yeah, well, anyway,  that pickled punk's  fucking up my dreams, man.  After I heard that,  I went to sleep  and I had this dream  like I was a little kid  and I was sitting  in somebody's kitchen  and this fat man  goes to the refrigerator  and pulls out  a little baby  and he starts  eating the kid's guts.  Anyway,  he, uh...  Yeah, he, uh... 
[02:31:00]  So what happened, sir?  You woke up  with a pounding erection,  did you?  No, man,  that kid, then...  The kid turns the tables  and starts biting  this dude's nose off  and chasing him  and, uh, yeah,  it was just a crazy dream  that's probably going  to stick with me  for the rest of my life.  Where are you calling from?  Louisiana.  Oh, New Orleans.  I'm in Pennsylvania  right now,  but I'm from Louisiana.  I'm a truck driver,  so I was hearing y'all,  you know,  ribbing us truck drivers earlier.  Little ribbon.  Little ribbon  we were giving them.  You're a truck-driving mother.  Fuckity, fuckity, fuckity. 
[02:31:30]  I drive this big truck  all over the country.  I'll drive it over there  and take care of y'all one day.  All right, Luke.  All right.  Thank you.  See you later, good buddy.  Bye.  Good buddy.  All right,  we got a problem  with the phone thing.  What's the problem?  I'll talk to Jaime  during the break.  He'll figure it out.  Why does Jaime have to leave?  Can't he stay?  Yeah, Jaime needs to be here  all the time.  He's a cool guy  and he knows how  all this stuff works.  He's got a great smile.  Alisa.  Alisa.  Hey, how are you?  Great.  Calling from Washington, D.C.  Absolutely. 
[02:32:00]  Our nation's capital.  Absolutely.  And I am so psyched  you guys are back on the air.  I tried to keep  the wow thing going  while you were off.  You know,  I wanted you to know,  you know,  your show's not just  for men only.  You've got a large  female basis out here  and I've got to get  a new sticker though  but I've been honoring  the wow stickers  that have been going  for the past two years.  Oh, you've been wowing?  Been wowing still  and I told the one guy,  you're going to just  die with this.  This is how much I love you.  I went and traded  in my car this weekend  to get one that had  XM Satellite Radio.  Hey, there you go. 
[02:32:30]  How's that for a faithful listener?  That's pretty cool.  Nice.  You got a nice set?  You got a nice set too?  Absolutely.  Out there at 36DD.  Oh.  Can you send us a picture?  Absolutely.  I will do that.  I'm going to email you  one actually today.  Do you have big gumdrop nips?  Do you?  No, actually.  Do you, Mr. Grady?  Wait, let's get this out of the way.  What kind of nips  everyone likes here.  I like the slow fade myself.  Okay.  Where the nip slowly fades  into the rest of the boob.  That's the areola. 
[02:33:00]  Huh?  No, I know.  I know.  But I mean,  I'm talking about  the whole area there.  I like a slow fade too.  Yeah, of course.  I'm going to say  that's what I have.  Yeah, I don't have  big nips or anything.  Yeah, just slow fade.  I think she's lying.  You know what I hate?  The nips that like  just stand out  because it looks like  Hershey Kisses.  Yeah, all one piece.  No.  I like the cone,  the cone areolas  like Tracy Lords has.  Oh, without a doubt.  Those are the best.  Those cone breasts.  Yeah.  They just,  they fade in. 
[02:33:30]  They're kind of like faders,  but there's so much  more areola,  just like,  you know,  chock full of areola.  I like the oversized  jujubes on a  silver dollar pancake.  Yes, I like that too.  Jujubes.  Mine are,  I'm going to say  mine are somewhat  a combo between that  and the fade in.  So I will send you a picture.  All right,  yeah,  send us a little picture.  And I'm going to  get my new  well sticker too,  but yeah,  I'm so glad.  And I'm out here listening  and I'm sure  I'll talk to you guys again.  Thank you.  I like the type of nipple  that somebody from  Suddenly Susan  can hang himself off of. 
[02:34:00]  Jim,  I've been listening to you  all morning.  You like some crazy shit.  He's just getting started too,  so.  I know.  All right,  yeah,  if you want to get  the new wow stickers,  we finally figured out  that problem.  You go to opiananthony.com.  There's a section there  where you just  send us your address  and they'll send out  the wow stickers,  okay?  There's a couple other  good phone calls coming in,  but the phone system's  a little,  I don't know.  Yeah,  you're reaching down  like by your junk  every time you're  going to a phone call.  Because we answer  phones with a mouse. 
[02:34:30]  The technology's  so crazy around here,  you've got to answer  it with a mouse.  It used to be a button.  And this mouse controls  all,  you know,  three of my screens.  And then there's  a thing down here,  screen number two,  push this button  so then I can  search the internet.  If I have to do  the phone thing,  I have to go to three.  I got that mess  over here too.  It won't stay on three  though is the problem.  Tony from Tampa,  what's up buddy?  Hey,  how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Just wanted to welcome  you back.  I happen to leave  New York about  two weeks after  you guys went off  the air.  I couldn't stand  the crap they  were playing up 
[02:35:00]  there.  I was just  wondering about  the drinking game.  Ope,  you've been doing  some,  you should have  some people  drunk by now.  Why?  You've been doing  a lot of  impersonations.  Oh,  remember the old  drinking game?  You had to do a  drink if Ope  did an impression?  What impression  have I done today?  About ten minutes  ago,  Anthony was talking  to his brother  about the songs  and you just  went on to  some kind of rant. 
[02:35:30]  Had an impression  in it?  Yeah,  what impression  are you talking  about,  sir?  I don't like  the fact that  you threw out  a thought and  hoped that the  honest idea  would show up.  Jim,  you're great.  Thank you.  Hey,  all I know  is that I've  been dying to  listen and I  hear you guys  and I just  miss out on the  game.  All right,  where's the ping pong  sound effect,  Anthony?  Oh,  we need that.  We know,  we need our  sounds.  All right,  thank you.  Here comes Jaime,  here to fix things.  Here comes Jaime.  That boyish smile.  What?  Oh,  I know I could do  that,  but see the button 
[02:36:00]  pops back to two  over here.  Wait,  could you get  the guy from  Frank's place  under the desk  to jump up  and fix that?  God,  these guys make  us look so  stupid.  He comes in  and goes,  idiot,  just turn this  button off  and everything  will be fine.  I like him.  I don't have  my templates  for the sound  effect.  No,  this show  is just  wrote them  down on  pieces of  paper.  No,  this show  is just  getting started.  We still  got to get  that working  right.  Yeah,  until I get 
[02:36:30]  that.  All right,  let's go to  Maine and say  hi to Rob.  Hey,  Rob,  what's up,  buddy?  Hey,  man,  how's it  going?  Pretty good.  I got an  etiquette question  for you.  It's a $20  bet.  If you gave me  the right answer,  I can win  $20.  All right.  We were  down in  the hunting  camp.  You know,  guys get  drunk,  they get  started talking  about weird  things.  They got  to start  about the  proper way  how to  wipe your  rear end  that you  can take  into the  crap.  I say  the correct  way is to  start from  front to  back.  Front to  back,  definitely. 
[02:37:00]  Absolutely.  Don't even  need the  other choice.  See,  the other  guy was  talking about  back to  front,  but that  wouldn't be  right.  That goes  against the  grain.  It goes  against the  grain.  Yeah,  it's all  over the  boys.  Imagine a  woman doing  that,  and then  if she  didn't get  cleaned up,  you went  down there  to do  the thing.  That just  wouldn't be  right.  Here's how  you wipe  properly.  Nobody  seems to  get this.  You find  an invalid,  you squeeze  their neck,  when their  tongue pops  out,  you use  it,  then you  leave.  That's  what you  do,  sir.  That's 
[02:37:30]  what you  do?  Yeah,  of course.  We had  guys showing  how they  actually do  it.  They get  drunk,  you know,  they get  stupid.  back to  front.  And they  show you  the roots  around in  there,  like he's  digging  around.  You're  supposed to  root around  for nothing.  You don't  do that,  do you?  Where's  the ping  pong sound  effect?  Rob,  what?  You don't  root around  for nothing,  do you?  Wait, 
[02:38:00]  say that  again?  You don't  root around  for nothing,  do you?  Hey,  Rob,  Rob.  Yeah.  Rob,  watch out.  Rob.  Rob.  I'm watching.  I'm watching.  Rob,  watch out.  Wow,  that had  a hurt.  Jesus.  He didn't  see it  coming.  Oh,  look at  it.  Oh,  rolling,  he's been  thrown from  the wreckage. 
[02:38:30]  And there  he hit the  ground.  There's Rob.  It's over,  Johnny.  And the  train didn't  even hit  Rob,  it just  hung  itself  when it  hurt his  conversation.  He didn't  see the  train,  he was  too busy  wiping his  ass.  Let's go  to,  back to  front.  Hey,  we got  a call  from Queens.  Andrew,  what's up?  What's up,  guys?  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Hey,  listen,  make sure  Brother Joe  plays the  gay survivor  soul.  Remember  that one?  That was  the one I  tricked Howard  with.  Do you  have that  one? 
[02:39:00]  No.  We used  to infiltrate  Howard's  show all  the time.  Infiltrate?  We  really did.  I almost  won 10  grand on  that one.  I know,  you were  in the  finals of  some song  parody contest.  And then he  found out  it was  Anthony's  brother's  song.  It shan't  be played  again.  That was  another  meeting we  had to  take and  the yelling  and screaming  behind the  doors.  How dare  you?  Blah,  blah,  blah.  More crap.  That was  Rich the  Fat Naked  Fag.  Because no  one could  take a  joke.  No one. 
[02:39:30]  He was  screaming the  next day.  I remember  that one when  you blew  him up.  What do  you think  you're doing?  What was  it?  I'm not  your daddy.  Remember how  much Imus  loved that?  Imus loved  when you  guys did  that.  Oh,  Imus loves  us.  I wish he  would stop  calling me.  He wants to  make sure  we're okay.  I'm okay,  Imus.  Does he  call you?  All the  time.  I never  met  Imus.  I love  Imus.  Imus in  the morning  program.  Jimmy has  to get a  picture.  I want  a picture  with Imus,  yes.  Imus gave 
[02:40:00]  me some  great stories  too.  Jimmy looks  like the  cancer kids  I take  care of  on the  ranch.  Come on  out there,  Jimmy.  I'll get  you some  of my  brother's  salsa,  get you  up on  a horse  and make  you work  at the  ranch.  We'll give  you some  of that  chemo.  Keep your  hair from  coming in.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  shut up,  McCord.  Why are you  wearing the  cowboy hat  today?  You're in  New York  City.  It's my  big fag  cowboy hat,  baby.  I'll wear  the bandana  around my  neck or  else my  neck skin  hits my  schlong. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  I miss  could take  a joke.  Loves the  impression.  It's a  little joke.  Humor.  All right,  we have to  take another  break,  okay.  When we  come back,  we'll do  the Brother  Joe songs,  right?  I'm just  wondering  something,  though,  as we get  a break.  You think  the night  before Howard  signed the  big deal  to go to  satellite radio,  you think he  might have  been in the  emergency room  again? 
[02:41:00]  We're at  St. Vincent's  Hospital down  in the  village.  I'm just  wondering.  With some  of our cop  friends around  watching.  Was there a  Z100 concert  Sunday night?  A jingle  ball?  I'm just  wondering.  Ouch.  If maybe he  could have  enjoyed this  signing.  Yeah,  didn't enjoy  the last  one too  much.  Not at  all.  Had a  busy night  that night.  Ow.  Allison.  Allison,  what have  we done?  We're  bad parents,  Allison. 
[02:41:30]  Jesus.  Refresh my  memory.  What was  the problem?  You know  what's funny  too?  As I recall,  I didn't  think Allison  looked too  happy when  she was  going into  the hospital.  I'm sure  not.  She was  staying at  Howie's  house.  All right,  in time.  Maybe I  shouldn't  spend so  much time  in the  Hamptons.  Maybe I  should be a  father.  Not out  banging  models.  Where did  Jimmy go?  Jim? 
[02:42:00]  Right here,  Greg.  Oh,  that's right.  Jimmy gets  really quiet  when we do  this stuff.  Now,  on satellite  radio,  I could use  any language,  Robin.  It could be  instead of  Howard Stern's  private parts,  Howard Stern's  fat cock.  Robin.  Not yet,  in 15 months.  15 months  you could do  that,  Howard.  15 months?  15 months,  yes.  It's a long  time.  It's a real  long time.  Gary,  get over here  and lick  my asshole. 
[02:42:30]  Okay,  boy.  All right,  Steve,  get us out  of here.  In the  groove.  O.P.  and Anthony.  Do some  push-ups,  fatty.  This is the  best show  ever.  The O.P.  and Anthony  Show.  Monopoly was  what I wanted  to mention.  Playing  Monopoly,  six people  can play,  can't they?  I believe  six can play.  There's only  four,  so only  four people  can have  a side  to keep  their cards  under,  you know.  Two guys  can be  on the  corners.  Monopoly. 
[02:43:00]  There's a place  that we've all  spent a lot  of time,  you know.  Very familiar.  I wasn't so  good at it.  I don't know  about you.  I didn't  play that  well.  I'd have  a couple  of railroads  anyway,  you know.  Not a  complete  asshole,  you know.  snap up  Baltic Avenue  as soon  as that  became  available.  Shit,  $60  can't go  wrong  on that  mother.  Let me  have that  one. 
[02:43:30]  It never  got much  farther.  Oh,  yeah,  I thought  the best  thing I  would own  would be  one piece  of property  in the  light blue  series.  Oriental  Avenue,  perhaps.  nothing on  it,  of course.  Maybe an  excavation.  It's about  all I ever  had on my  property  was plans,  surveyor's  marks,  all my  friends had  malls,  condominiums,  shopping centers,  industrial parks. 
[02:44:00]  Oh,  boy,  Colin,  you're coming  down my  side now.  Oh,  big  one.  Hot  shit of  12.  Right  past that  asshole.  Yeah.  Don't  worry,  you'll be  around again,  man. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah,  but you  can't move  your token  until you  remember  which  goddamn  one did  you have.  Hey,  what is  I?  What am  I?  Am I  the car?  No,  you're  the  battleship.  I'm  the  battleship  every  game.  Okay.  Funny  ones they  had.  How the  hell did  the shoe  get in  there,  man?  The guy  must have  got drunk  the second  night he  was working  on the  game,  you know?  Let's  put in  a shoe, 
[02:45:00]  man.  goes  with  the  hat.  I  always  used  to  ask  for  the  overcoat  just  to  piss  off  the  banker,  you  know?  There  is  no  overcoat.  The  worst  token  to have  was  that  goddamn  cannon.  It was  the only  one that  kept  falling  over,  you  know?  It was  the only  top-heavy  token.  You  throw  the dice  anywhere  near it  and  pick it  up.  Hey,  are you  the  cannon?  Pick it  up,  would you  please? 
[02:45:30]  Pick it  up and  you,  are you  in jail  or just  visiting?  Put the  car on  the outside  if you're  just  visiting.  Some  guys  cared.  That's  why they  won,  man.  I  never  won.  I  kept  landing  on  chance,  trying  to  buy  it.  You  did  more  fights  trying  to  buy  chance.  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 
[02:46:00]  chance.  Little  man  with  a  hat.  $200  for being  an  asshole.  Shuffle  them good,  that's the  second time  I got  that one.  so,  uh,  well, 
[02:46:30]  I didn't  win,  but I  was always  in at  the end  of the  game,  because I  had all  the $1  bills.  Yeah,  $1,500 in  singles,  and they  needed me  to make  change.  They're  shitty  deals.  $1,500 in  $1,500 in  $1,500 in  $1,500 in  $1,500 in  $1,500 in  an open letter  to Opie and  Anthony.  Anthony,  if your penis  wasn't so small,  I'd let you  shove it in  between my  big teeth.  The Freak Show!  The Opie and  Anthony Show.  All right, 
[02:47:00]  where's  Jaime?  Now I  can't control  the headphone  volume.  Oh.  I just blew  an eardrum  there.  While we're  waiting for  Jaime,  um,  Matt from  Jersey has  an immediate  feedback. 
[02:47:30]  It says,  I've been  trying to  call in  about this  one since  yesterday.  Grandma  Junk says,  I remember  crawling under  my grandmother's  moo-moo and  looking up and  I thought I  saw a tightly  wrapped pack of  knockwurst.  Thank you for  that image.  Now I have  grandma's moo-moo.  Just smelling  like powder under  there, I bet.  No,  probably not at  all.  It probably  smells like  underarm and  urine.  The smell 
[02:48:00]  of decay and  dreams not  realized.  The smell  of a dead  husband and  dead friends.  The smell  of mothballs  in a lonely  apartment.  Collage of  pictures on  the wall of  people long  gone.  Yeah,  they're all  black and  whites in  little circles  with the  faded.  And this  was my  first.  All right,  now the  phones aren't  working.  They're not.  No.  What,  you can't  take a  call?  I see 
[02:48:30]  them up  there.  I know,  but look,  the mouse  doesn't move.  Oh,  wait,  I can do  it this  way.  Let's try  it.  Oh.  Hey,  Jeff from  Boston,  what's going  on?  What's up,  buddy?  What's up?  What do  you got  today?  You guys  must be  getting more  listeners  every day.  They're  paying the  ass to get  through  today.  Yes.  Every day,  people are  turning on  their XM  satellite radios  to our  channel.  Yes.  We get  the numbers  every day,  and it's  pretty exciting  to see the  growth at  this point.  Yeah,  Howard was  snapping  yesterday.  Well,  he's going  to snap  a lot in  the next 
[02:49:00]  15 months,  though.  You guys  are the  pioneers now,  right?  Enjoy the  20-minute  commercial breaks  for the next  15 months.  I can't  even listen  to him.  It's  terrible.  So,  what do  you think  of the  Sox this  year?  That's  why I  called in,  dude.  I'm pumped.  I'm pumped,  dude.  Trying to  get the  FU line.  It wasn't  working,  so I  just want  to give  a big  fuck you  to the  Yankees.  Hey,  they did  all right  last night.  I hate  them.  You don't  hate them,  sir.  You want  to be  like them.  You secretly  admired the  Yankees.  That's true.  I wish I  could win  like them.  I ain't  going to  lie.  Boston  fans are  so, 
[02:49:30]  I don't  know,  obsessed  with the  Yankees.  With the  Yankees.  It goes  both ways,  man.  No,  it does.  The Yankee  fans definitely  get pumped  up for the  Red Sox  series.  You know  something?  Maybe during  baseball season  or maybe  during the  end of  baseball season,  but I'm  talking it's  a year-round  thing.  It could be  the middle  of frigging  February,  and there  will be a  Yankee suck  chant in  Boston anywhere.  At church,  you'll get a  Yankee suck  chant.  You're right,  though.  You're right.  You guys seem  a little more  obsessed with  the Yankees 
[02:50:00]  than you should  be.  It's more  bitter.  Oh,  the bitterness  is just  unbelievable.  And I  really do  hope that  the Sox  go really,  really far.  this year,  because that  disappointment  when it  finally does  kick in,  when that  ball goes  between the  legs of  Buckner,  it's just  awful.  It's so  fun to  watch,  though.  And then  it's just  fun to  watch all  the drunk  people in  Boston the  night that  the Sox  finally choke  going out to  all the bars 
[02:50:30]  on Lansdowne  Street,  getting drunk  and just  causing riots,  overturning  cars,  saying,  next year,  next year.  Yeah,  but this  year,  I'm trying  to talk  what Jaime's  in front  of me  trying to  fix  everything.  But this  year,  the Sox  have the  pitching.  It doesn't  matter what  the Sox  ever have.  Pitching wins  World Series.  Doesn't matter  what the Sox  ever have.  They had it  last year.  They choked.  They didn't  have Curt  Schilling  last year.  They didn't  need Curt  Schilling.  They had Pedro  into the  eighth inning  with a  4-0 lead  and they  wouldn't  take him  out.  Curt is  going to 
[02:51:00]  put him  over the  top this  year.  He's  going to  win his  game.  He's a  bucket of  jizz and  we never  think about  the Red Sox  until we're  smashing their  faces in the  playoffs.  If Wade Boggs  or Clemens  won the  championship,  they come to  New York,  we put a  Yankee hat on  to give them  a championship.  They haven't  been good  enough to  win a  World Series  since 1918?  Is that what  you're saying?  This is the  year, but  they haven't  been good  enough since  19 years away  from the  1800s.  I'm telling  you they got  a good shot  this year  because they  got the  pitching.  The Yankees  don't have  the greatest  pitching.  The Yankees  have always 
[02:51:30]  persevered even  when their  team hasn't  been completely  up to snuff  through that  Yankee spirit.  If we do  win, there's  going to be a  riot down here.  You had Ted  Williams and  you couldn't  win.  Everybody talks  about the  Yankees  money long  before salary  caps and  many, many  years ago.  The Yankees  always dominated.  I'm going to  explain this.  Yes, they  had Ted  Williams, but  they didn't  have darkies  around him  playing.  Ted Williams  frozen head  flying over  the green  monster.  Wouldn't  that be  some sight?  The Red  Sox did 
[02:52:00]  it to  themselves  because the  owner was a  racist and  he didn't  like golfers  on his  baseball team.  There was a  whole documentary  on HBO  about the curse  and it  showed how  Boston, the  Red Sox  refused to  acknowledge that  the black  athlete was  taking over  baseball and  they continued  to assign the  white players and  everyone else  cleaned up and  the Red Sox were  stuck with  inferior players.  Isn't that the  curse of the  Sam Bino? 
[02:52:30]  You know, it's  funny too.  Do you guys  remember when we  were up in  Boston, one of  our trips for  the Sex for  Sam contest,  the STP show  and the Yankee  Sucks chant?  I remember  looking at it  and just dying  before Stone  Temple Pilots  show, Yankees  suck.  It's before  anything.  They're ready to  open up the  tunnel after the  big dig.  Yankees suck!  Yankees suck!  What does that  have to do with  a tunnel?  It's been 85 
[02:53:00]  years, we're a  little better.  It's on the  plaque for the  new bridge.  I was driving  over and I  stopped, brand new  bridge, blah, blah,  blah, Yankees suck.  Written right there  on the brass  plaque.  Hey dude, how  do I get one  of those wow  stickers?  Just go to  opiatenthony.com.  Yeah, it's  pretty obvious  now.  There's a little  section where  you give us  your address  and we send  about you  shoot a  pregnant woman  and you blame  it on a  black Yankee.  Way to go.  Up there in  Boston.  Mickey Rivers  shot my wife.  Gotta get him  back some way. 
[02:53:30]  Alright, I'm  with you this  year, bro.  Alright, buddy.  Go Sox.  Go Sox.  In my  neighborhood, we  wouldn't sign  the dog people  the colors.  They're animals  anyway, so let  them play anything  but this sport.  Let them lose  their souls.  But you don't  think the Yankees  can beat the  Angels, you're  saying?  I know the  Yankees can't  beat the  Angels.  They got  knocked out of  the first  round, what  was it, last  year?  Or two years  ago?  They can't  beat the  Angels.  I don't  care who's  playing for  the Angels.  They can't  beat them.  So you're  hoping Boston  wins that one.  Of course.  Aaron Boone,  it doesn't  matter who we  put up.  They're well on  their way.  I will say, I'm 
[02:54:00]  not going to be  an idiot about  it.  I'm not going  to be like the  Boston fans are  to the Yankees.  I'll say Boston  looks really good  this year.  They look like a  team that can do  it.  But they're  Boston.  It's the Red Sox.  They've looked  great before and  they always choke.  Choke, choke,  choke.  And the biggest  problem is Opie's  behind them this  year.  Yep, and that's  right there is the  last nail in the  coffin.  That really is  that.  The sports  jinx Opie.  By the way, all  the games are heard  on XM Satellite  Radio. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, how about  that?  What, the  playoff games?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't  know that.  Fantastic.  Nice.  There you go.  Traveling this  week, I'm going to  Albany, I can  actually listen to  the game.  Oh, really?  You're going to  be there?  Why are you  going to be in  Albany?  Why would you  do that?  I don't even  want to plug the  Palace here on  Friday night.  So what?  Yeah, don't.  Not important.  Very good.  And what about  the Braves?  The poor Braves?  Oh, America's  team.  What's their  record now?  They have the  best record in the  90s, but they  can't win at  all, ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  And they're going 
[02:55:00]  to choke again this  year.  That's CNN owning  liberal.  Good.  They should lose.  Ted Turner hasn't  owned CNN in a  long time.  But we all know  who I meant.  And he married  that awful woman.  Hanoi Jane.  There used to be  this great thing in  the White Rose in  Edison was this  great burger joint,  and there was the  Jane Fonda urinal in  the middle of the  urinal.  It had her in the  workout thing, and it  was just fantastic.  And you would just  what, urinate on her?  Just look at it and  go, lucky Jane.  Oh, yeah, the White 
[02:55:30]  Rose?  Hey, look at that.  The Today Show  mentioning the Opie  and Anthony show.  Oh, how about that?  Really?  There you go.  Yeah.  Oh.  I just saw Anna  Kornikova.  I heard she has  great camel toe.  Yeah.  I like that.  Yeah, we're kind  of waiting for the  phones to pop back  on.  I don't, let's see.  Clint?  Yeah.  What's up, Clint?  Hey, welcome back,  y'all.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Say, I got an  asking a question.  How come y'all  are slipping there  on us?  What do you mean 
[02:56:00]  slipping?  Well, the old  O&A there, they  would have took that  girl there a while  ago that had the  big cans.  They would have  had her have a  masturbation fit on  their ground  radio.  Hmm.  Good point.  Yeah, you know,  you called us out  on that.  You're right.  We should start  asking.  No, that's all  right, man.  Y'all doing  good.  Our dream.  Good work.  Y'all suck.  I don't like to  have a truck driver  to eat.  What?  Oh, that was  a friend of mine.  He was saying,  he was saying,  stop, I think the  black guy fell off 
[02:56:30]  the chain.  Hey, are you  hanging out with  your good buddy?  I love the way  these guys from  Dallas sound.  Are you hanging  out with your  good buddy?  No, man, we're  not no good  buddies.  Y'all take it  easy.  We enjoy listening  to y'all.  Thanks, Clint.  Keep up the good  work.  Spread the virus  for us.  Tell the rest of  the truckers out  there, the ONA  virus is now on  XM Satellite Radio.  I know.  Something about  that accent that  just...  Our dream was to  come in here one  morning, go to  the first phone  call, and it's a  girl masturbating.  Something you just 
[02:57:00]  can't do on  commercial radio.  You can't do it  on commercial radio.  We've got to see  what this thing  can do, this  satellite radio.  Hey, don't we  have a clip of  that girl from  Boston?  I was thinking  about that.  Remember her?  Yes.  It was probably  one of the best  orgasms ever on  the air.  She was from  Boston, called  up, it was  totally real.  She was watching  some porno, and  she was on her  bed, in her  bedroom, finishing  herself off, and  it sounded great.  You have that 
[02:57:30]  somewhere, don't  you?  Oh, yeah.  Don't you?  Oh, I do.  Yes, you do.  I do remember  that one.  Yes, I do.  Fantastic.  Great.  All right, we  got to, not that  we got to, we  should, we got to  play Brother Joe's  songs.  Yes.  You know, it is  more than the  accent.  You're not trying  to touch me, are  you?  More than the  accent?  What?  It's that nasal  thing they get  going on.  Well, that's all  part of it.  They got the  twang, they call  it.  It's the twang.  But why does it  get nasal?  I mean, I could  see the accent  itself, but... 
[02:58:00]  But then they  got that thing  going on.  I don't know.  Don't make fun  of them.  We need them.  No, I'm  celebrating them.  Yes.  It's a celebration  of diversity, this  program.  Absolutely.  The sincerest form  of flattery.  We're trying to  understand everybody  out there.  Good call, Joe.  Good call.  Words of wisdom,  Joe.  Words of wisdom.  All right, let's  play some songs.  I'd like to know  who's buying my  drinks, Lloyd.  It's not a matter  that concerns you  at this time.  Hey, Joe, obviously 
[02:58:30]  track four is  the showstopper.  Yes.  Yeah, that's the  piece de resistance.  What should we  play here?  Pick anyone.  Go eeny, meeny.  What are they?  All right, we got  the SARS song.  Want to try the  SARS song?  Sure.  You can hear the  SARS song.  Sure.  We never played  this on a radio  show before.  Nope.  If some of these  stink, we're going  to have to call you  out on it.  That's it.  We can't go like,  ha, ha, ha.  Take me off to the  side and kick my ass.  Yeah, I'm a little  nervous that we're  trying out the song  live on the show. 
[02:59:00]  Kick my ass for a  man.  Joe, they mean  spirit.  I don't like that.  I know Joe.  I've known Joe for  many, many years as  him being my brother.  And I know Joe  sometimes can be  hit or miss.  Hit or miss with  the song parodies.  I heard Jimmy mention  SARS this morning, and  I thought this song  would just fit  perfectly.  Oh, it's topical.  All right, we're  trying to make an  impression out there.  Then play something  really good first.  All right, here.  I vote for the  SARS song.  Go ahead. 
[02:59:30]  Joe seems to have  faith in that one.  We don't have  confidence in the  SARS song.  Joe seems to have  faith in it.  I have plenty of  confidence in the  SARS song.  But let's go with  one of the hits.  Yeah, let's go with  the hits first.  You've got to think of  it like a concert  that you go to.  It's got to be the  opening song where  you get everyone's  sight.  And it's a hit.  Well, then do  something that you  guys have been  talking about.  Let's say Black  Earl.  Dry Vagina.  Dry Vagina is a  classic.  That's a quick one.  That's a classic.  That's timeless.  All right, what track  is that?  Track seven.  All right.  Can DC cue that  one up for us? 
[03:00:00]  This is going to  mess them up because  it's not in the  dilette.  Yeah.  We're playing it  off a CD.  Through the CD  player.  What?  Oh, that wasn't  too distracting.  Thanks.  Has everyone  stopped and looked  at you?  What was it?  Nothing.  All right.  Dry Vagina,  Anthony?  Dry Vagina for the  first time unedited.  Brother Joe.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, here it is.  Good.  Oh. 
[03:00:30]  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry, dry vagina.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  So, before my penis starts to get sore, come pick up some badsy lube at your local drugstore.  I said, go get some badsy lube at your local drugstore. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, you stink, baby.  Well, there you go.  There's a classic.  The first time that has been played uncensored.  Actually, I love this satellite radio thing.  Actually, not, Ope.  No, that was played at NEW Uncensored, but then they started bitching at you about it.  Then we got in trouble.  Oh, really?  Then we got in trouble, and they took the CD away, and I kept bringing you new CDs so 
[03:01:30]  you guys could keep on playing.  All right, can I pick one, Ant?  Sure.  I love Brother Joe's song.  The only thing was that that reminded me of a Tom Jones song, though.  Shut up.  It kind of sounded like a Tom Jones tune.  That's great, man.  Oh, my God.  My favorite song's not on here.  Which one?  The Patty Duke thing.  Well, Ben Waterspill.  Yeah, it is.  It sure is.  It's the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen song.  Oh, the Mary Kate and Ashley song was done for the Patty Duke theme.  My brother, Joe, seems to really like the Patty Duke theme for songs.  Could it possibly be that it's probably the easiest thing to write a parody to? 
[03:02:00]  No, no, no.  I worked so hard on the tracks for that one.  Oh, that you wanted to keep using it?  I had to keep on using it.  I fell in love with the tracks.  I actually could not find any type of karaoke version of the Patty Duke theme, so I had  to lay down each individual instrument.  It's me playing an orchestra.  Right.  That's what it is.  All right.  And having no life.  It's a head trip thing.  So this is the Olsen twins song?  Yes.  Brother Joe.  All edited for the first time.  Here's Mary Kate.  She likes Disney flicks. 
[03:02:30]  And Barbie dolls.  And Fogo sticks.  But Ashley is a little slut.  She likes her loving in the butt.  Loves them porno flicks.  They're the Olsen.  Adolescent vixens.  All the way.  They will give up their high mans.  Some lucky guy one day.  While Mary Kate likes to play knock-knock and hide and seek and sing a lot.  Well, Ashley is the one that goes so glad they take off all her clothes for the money shot. 
[03:03:00]  They're the Olsen's.  They're the Olsen's.  Identical vixens.  And you'll find.  They laugh alike.  They're all the way.  I bet they'll even fuck alike.  And you know they'll be tied.  The Olsen's.  Take them from behind.  There you go.  The Olsen Twins song.  I like that one.  Thank you.  Definitely like that one. 
[03:03:30]  Unedited.  It's just, you know, it's just so much better to hear them that way.  Yeah.  Paul from Center Reach saying you've got to redo that one with a bulimia theme.  Ah, yes.  Ah, yes.  I do have the Patty Duke tracks, so I absolutely can.  All right, Ant, your turn to pick one.  That buzz kill.  By the way, stick around.  Putting on weight.  Stick around for the showstopper at the end of this segment.  That's when we warn everybody and make sure your radio's not too loud.  Ah.  Hmm.  I know it's satellite radio, but you don't want, you know, your coworkers punching you in the face. 
[03:04:00]  I love the James Taylor DMX.  All right.  That one.  You know, that thing, I did an internet search on my, I popped my name into, I googled up my name,  and that thing came up on more websites with, like, legitimate James Taylor songs.  I mean, legit James Taylor songs right next to it.  Well, everyone knows the DMX song, Up In Here, Up In Here.  Party Up.  I think this is my favorite thing that you've done, to be honest with you. 
[03:04:30]  Party Up.  Yeah.  What's the, uh.  This is, uh, track five.  Track five.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is James Taylor, of course.  Everyone knows James Taylor.  Um, doing that song.  The DMX song.  Yeah.  Party Up.  Party Up.  Party Up.  Party Up.  Y'all gon' make me lose my mind.  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all gon' make me go all out. 
[03:05:00]  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all gon' make me act a fool.  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all gon' make me lose my cool.  Up in here.  Up in here.  If I gots to bring it to you cowards, then it's gonna be quick.  All right.  All you mans up in the jail before, suck my dick.  And all them other cats you run with, get done with dumb quick. 
[03:05:30]  How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some dumb shit?  All right.  There go the gun clip.  9-1-1 shit.  All over some dumb shit.  Ain't that some shit?  Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club.  Cause every time you come around, it's like what? 
[03:06:00]  I just gotta get my dick sucked.  And I don't know who the fuck you think you're talking to, but I'm not in Iceland.  So watch what you do while you go.  Find yourself buried next to someone else.  And we all thought you loved yourself.  But that couldn't have been the issue. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, maybe they just saying that.  Now costing a miss, you shit, a nigga tried to diss you.  That's why you're laying on your back, looking at the roof of the church.  Preacher telling the truth, and you know that it hurts.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Y'all gon' make me lose my mind up in here, up in here. 
[03:07:00]  Y'all gon' make me go all out up in here, up in here.  Y'all gon' make me act a fool up in here, up in here.  Y'all gon' make me lose my cool up in here, up in here.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I love ballad. 
[03:07:30]  Isn't that nice?  What a sweet song.  That was kind of too nice, I think.  Yeah, I kind of got stuck on the James Taylor thing, too. 
[03:08:00]  It was that Valentine's Day song that I did.  That's actually it that's on the disc, too.  But remember the first time you guys played that over at N.E.W.?  You had one of DMX's people called up and requested a copy of it.  Yes!  I had to send it off to him.  He was like, yo, that was dope!  Yeah, because I want to sue you, mother...  All right, should we finally play the SARS song?  DMX would just kill you.  Yeah, let's hear what that one is.  All right.  This is a brand new song by Brother Joe?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it was new when the SARS thing came out.  You guys haven't played it on the air yet. 
[03:08:30]  And you have confidence in this one?  Absolutely do.  I think it'll get a chuckle or two.  All right.  All right.  It'll even make little Jimmy chuckle.  All right.  It's here.  The grand finale coming up.  That's when we take satellite radio right to the limit, Anthony.  All right.  I know what song that is.  We're going to see what this satellite radio thing can do in a few minutes.  But first, it's the SARS song from Brother Joe.  Sick with the SARS. 
[03:09:00]  I cough and I wheeze.  That incurable illness.  Thank the Chinese for SARS.  Infected with SARS  I caught mom in pain  I must have got it from that chick on the plane  With SARS

Growing up as a kid  So pretty  Seeing her  In her little bathing suit  With the Hawaiian episode  And stuff  It was fantastic  It was even better  Remember the TV movie  That they did  About behind the scenes  The Brady Punch?  Yeah  And they had that one scene  With I think it was Greg  Getting into the pool  With the actress  That played Marsha  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, she was pretty hot too  Yeah, the one that played Marsha  Not the movie  Not the Brady Bunch movie  It was the TV documentary  Oh my god 
[03:14:30]  But Marsha  When I was growing up  Marsha was the chick  Wait, what was the one  The one where Greg was getting older  And Robert Reed kept getting on a scale  And he was getting lighter  And lighter  And lighter  And like  Someone threw something  And hit him in the face  Oh no, no, no  Someone threw a ball  And hit him in the rectum  And he kept going  Oh my T-cells  All my T-cells  Mom always said  Don't go bareback in the house  Here's the Marsha Brady song 
[03:15:00]  Well all I hear all day long  At school is how  Great Marsha is at this  Or how wonderful Marsha did that  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha  Marsha  Looking at the screen  What does this feeling mean  I got the shiver way down deep in my loins  Her blonde haired beauty  And who ain't she a cutie  The best in every club that she joins  She teases all the fellas  Her little sister's jealous 
[03:15:30]  A Scottish from her head to her toes  While she wears a groovy skirt  With a flower print shirt  She's turning heads wherever she goes  And all the things she does to me  I, I, I, I  Got my very first border  Watching Marsha Brady  On a black and white scene of TV  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha 
[03:16:00]  Marsha  Marsha  Billboard Junior High  Her sparkling blue eyes  A smile anyone to die for  Well, I almost shot my load  At the Hawaiian episode  But mommy started knocking on my door 
[03:16:30]  She's sweeter than a peach  In her bikini on the beach  The other girls couldn't compare  Yeah, and what a piece of ass  When she took that hula class  Her skirt so short  I think I saw hair  And all the things she does to me  You're in her virginity  I, I, I, I 
[03:17:00]  Got my very first border  Watching Marsha Brady  On a black and white scene of TV  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha  Golly gee  I, I, I  Got my very first border  Watching Marsha Brady  On a black and white scene of TV  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha  Golly gee  I, I, I 
[03:17:30]  Got my very first border  Watching Marsha Brady  On a black and white scene of TV  Yeah  Marsha Brady  There's the Marsha Brady song  Brother Joe  Anthony on vocals  Yes  That is rock cut  That is actually rock cut  That will be  And we will be over at the downtown  Oh my god  You didn't say what  All the original  All the original members, man  Wow, really?

[03:18:00]  For that show  I'm telling you, man  Camp out  I'm going to do the whole camp out thing  There are so many skells from Long Island  That are actually buying up tickets for that show  It's going to be a sold out show  We understand that  Yeah  All right, are we ready for the grand finale?  Oh, of course  You notice it all of a sudden smells really nice in here?  Yes  Hey, it's my sister just walked in  The first woman  Great  First chick in the studio  It's got to be my sister  Great  I'm the first one  What?  I'm the first one?  Yeah  That's sad, guys 
[03:18:30]  It is really sad  Yeah, but I don't know what's going on  We've really got to get women up here  All right, pull out your tits  Okay, Anthony Joseph  Close your eyes  I have a thing for Anthony's sister  She's really, really beautiful  She's hot  But I mean, I've known these guys so long  She's kind of my sister now, too  I don't want to see that  You have a thing  And it can't be cured  You can stop right at that  Stop that  I have a thing  I have a thing  It's called AIDS  All right 
[03:19:00]  Bobby, you see my AZT  I'm a curly-haired sissy  All right  It's time for the showstopper  Who was dying really slowly on his own  Jimmy, you're taking my job  Four good buddies  You mind if I use that?  No  That's the start of another song  There you go  It's time for the showstopper, Anthony  Yes  We're going to test the limits of satellite radio right now 
[03:19:30]  A song that could not be played  And if Dawn can handle it  If my sister can handle listening to this  Then I don't want to hear from any of you bitches  Bitchy  I don't want to hear from any bitches  We have ten female listeners  And after this song, we'll have one  We will have one left  No, my mom will be listening too  Yeah, great  We have two left  Look at Joe from Jersey  Let's play What's in Anthony's Sister's Pants  No  No  I'm not going to play What's in Anthony's Sister's Pants 
[03:20:00]  If it's anything like the hair on her head  She'd never get the phone to move  Anthony, it's not  Wrap it up like a Venus flytrap  We're going to catch it  She's got frankenfurter in her lap  From Rocky Horror  Frankenfurter  Frankenfurter  Frankenfurter  Frankenfurter  She's got frankenberry in her pants  You've got Count Chocula 
[03:20:30]  Frankenfurter  Frankenfurter  I noticed this is about the time where the show goes bad  Horribly awry  Because we're all so tired at this point  Until we figure out this sleep schedule  I'm actually getting my energy  Are you?  All right, well  I guess we should warn people  I know it's satellite radio  And pretty much anything goes  We understand that  But we don't want you to get in trouble at work  This is as rude as it gets  Yeah, well, you know  Joe was going through a tough time with his marriage  At the time he wrote this 
[03:21:00]  So I think it's completely justified  So you might want to control the volume on your XM satellite radio  This is the most angry I've ever been  Yeah  What's the name of the song?  Absolutely the most angry I've ever been  A cunt, Jim  That's what it's called  All right, but I don't think you have to be angry at a woman to write that  You could love her very much  Oh, this guy's playing  Guess what's in Anthony's sister's pants  What'd he guess?  He guessed the guy from the Olive Garden commercial  Oh!  That's the only time 
[03:21:30]  That's somebody who knows  And that will leave a clue  Oh my God  People know way too much history  Yeah, they certainly do  God, these guys don't forget anything  That's funny  Jesus  All right, here it is  You've been warned  Yes  C is for the way you 
[03:22:00]  Crap on me  You  Is cause you're ugly  And so's your peach  Hands  But no, I never  Told you that I railed your sister  Tea  Thanks for the hummers  They were better than your mother's  Cunt  Is all you'll ever be  See, it's true  Cunt  You must be more than one

[03:24:00]  Well, we checked out the O.B. and Anthony show  They're nothing but a bunch of filthy mouth bastards  Thank God they can't write about it  Oh, that's true  Go ahead  Give it a try  You can blame it all on me  Yeah, there's really nothing to say after playing that song  Shay from Oklahoma says  That's effing funny  I mean, it's no baby raper  But it's good  Remember that song?  From the world's most offensive song contest that we ran?  I loved Q  Little girls  Yes  I'm horny  Yeah, that got us an FCC complaint  Can we play that again someday? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, someday  Maybe someday, Jimmy  I'll look forward to it  A line from that was  I'd like to cut their nipples off  And stick them on ze ceiling  Remember that?  Hey, PJ from the Bronx  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?

Oh, it's behind it?  You put the bat behind it  Behind it  There'd be nowhere in Brooklyn  I can hang my pussy-stained bat  Hey, Matt, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good  Hey, I just got a  Well, I've had XM for a while  But I just seen on the website  You guys came over 
[03:26:00]  And I'm just  I'm a first-time listener  Never have  Heard your guys' show before  Oh, thank God  You didn't hear Monday's show  Oh, I'll tell you  So I'm sitting there  I'm driving to Chicago for work  And I was sitting there  And I was like  Well, you know what?  I'll try to get a show out  So I gave him a buzz to subscribe  I'll tell you what  You guys rock  All right  It was fantastic  And I can't believe it  I just said  Come on the radio  That's the best part of this place  Thank you  I just want to tell you guys  Absolutely just rock  You guys got a good lister here  All right  Thanks a lot 
[03:26:30]  All right  Thanks, Matt  Bye-bye  Bye  Feels good  They want me to throw my sister  In a 55-gallon drum  Nice  George, what's up?  Hey, thanks, guys  My wife just called me  And told me I have to give  My XM satellite radio back  Appreciate it  You're pussy whipped, bro  I know  All right  Mormon Jordan from D.C.  Is wondering if that new  Smash Sensation, the C-Word song  Is going to be on Frank's Place  Has it been added? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah  That's the Oompa Loompa  Hey, John, what's going on?  Hey, guys  I'd like to know if Anthony's sister  Wants to play the Money Snatch game  They want Dawn to play  Every single game  You guys have ever  Invented  Disgusting things  All in the last  All right  Half hour  Remember the Money Snatch?  You know, that's why  We love our listeners  They help us out with the show  That's how we get  The women down here  You know something?  It bribes them with money  Money always gets chicks down here  That's how we get the women down here  Very good  Should we try to set that up  For next week? 
[03:27:30]  Why not?  Mm-hmm  The Money Snatch game is great  Another game we weren't allowed to do  On commercial radio anymore  No, because it was fun  And entertaining  Billy Mac wondering if  My brother has jumped over Frenchie  In the eyes of our agent  Bob Eatman  In people that we shouldn't have  On the show anymore  I think Bob was listening to us yesterday  Because he had no comments  About the last two shows  Oh, boy  I think he took it personally  That we don't want him  Giving us feedback about the show  I talked to Bob the other day  And he's like 
[03:28:00]  I'm like  You didn't like Frenchie?  And he's like  No  And I laughed  And he goes  Why?  Was that you?  Like he thought it might be me  No  I'm like  No  Cure for insomnia  The Money Snatch game is great though  We get a bunch of women  Down here to the studio  And we pretty much  Tape money all over the studio  Throw it on the floor  I mean a lot  Like a couple thousand dollars  In singles  Yeah  And then we get a couple leaf blowers  And the girls  Enter the studio 
[03:28:30]  Completely naked  And they can grab as much money as possible  Within what?  I forget  It was about  A minute or two minutes  It's a take off  On that stupid radio thing  That all the morning zoos do  Where they put the girl  In the bank vault  With all the money  Now we'll get the fans  Going to blow the money around  Look at her pick up the body  Well we do it our way  Where the girls have to do it  Naked in the studio  We got the leaf blowers  To make it a little harder  And the only thing  With this bit  The girls can't have any money 
[03:29:00]  In their hands  At the end of the time  Period  All the money  Has to be stored  In their vag  Or wherever  Or some of the girls  Were using the armpits  And stuff  Were they?  Oh yeah man  And yeah  They were sticking it on their bodies  I need the armpits  You know something?  I gotta disagree  Because remember  The girls had to roll it up  It took a long time  I believe the only place  They could hold money  Was in their snatch  Money snatch  You're right  It's called money snatch  Not money armpit  That's right  Alright  Although money armpit 
[03:29:30]  Would be fun  With that surfer girl  From Hawaii  Watch her play it  With that little nub  Trying to grab the dollars  That supple little  13 year old  Rotting half a chicken wing  Trying to  Desperately just to  Fly like the other boys  Trying to run around  In a circle in the yard  Your safe board  Your safe board  Safe board  Your safe board  Yeah  I meant surf board  I think you should  Limit the space  To the Frank's Place cubicle  Just dump all the money  In there  Oh we can do it 
[03:30:00]  In the Frank's Place  Yeah we should  Hey  Get out of the cubicle  We're using it  But hey  That's my  Out of the cubicle  Remember the money  Snatch game though  Where the girl  Was in the corner  This is one time  I really felt bad  About something we did  We thought it was  Going to be a fun  Goofy little thing  Yeah  And one girl  Was in the corner  After it was over  Sobbing and crying  Completely naked  And we're like  What's the problem  She goes  Now I got enough money  To buy Christmas presents  For my daughter  I'm like  Oh god  That was a feel good  Moment for me  Just awful  Should have brought 
[03:30:30]  The kid in  We could have given  Her a few bucks too  She was so desperate  For money for Christmas presents  She came in and did that  Good  Good for her  That's what happened  You don't need a college education  Just get a hole big enough  To hold some cash in  And you're more than welcome  To come in here  Earn us for that  Spoiled brat's presents  That's a girl  You should have asked  To play cherry darts  There you go  Oh another one  Right  I loved that one  Dawn  Rocket at a Derek Jeter  Cardboard cutout  Was it a Bernie Williams  It was actually El Duque 
[03:31:00]  Oh it was El Duque  That's right  When are we going to  Start doing all this stuff  El Duque  We need a little bit  More room though  This studio's great  But it's a little small  For certain things  So where else can we do it  Don't want to disturb people  Working in the office  This is an office  You know  I come in here  With my comb over  Which is body pinned  And I'd like it  Nice and quiet  Oh my god  I'm looking at him  As Jimmy's saying  I know  Isn't it so uncomfortable  I've got another puzzle for you 
[03:31:30]  If you are wise  You'll listen to me  We need to get the bulldozer  And get rid of all these cubicles  So we can do all these fine things  Absolutely  We need room for the Bottle Rocket  Enough of the CDs  Stacked up out there  Just sit at any desk you want Ben  You're the producer here

[03:35:30]  Teeth were falling out  As he talked to you  Excuse me Tom  You're the station manager  And you have a fly  On your tooth  Remember when  When he was in the grocery store  Buying something  And Norton got on the phone  And told the woman  That you asked Tom  To put on the ugliest woman  In the store  Yeah we got Tom  We're talking to him  And we're like  Put someone on the phone  So he puts this black lady  On the phone  And we're like  Hello miss  And she's like  Why am I on the phone  And we're like  We told Tom to find  The ugliest woman  In that store  And she starts  Screaming at Tom  Ooh Tom  Ooh Tom

[03:42:30]  You're in bed going  Come on Joey  Five more minutes  And your penis is going  Take me shopping  I need a new hat  But you remember when they first came out with the hard-on  Third, fourth grade  You're leaning over like the hunchback of Notre Dame  Teacher calls you up to the board  And you're like  I don't think so honey  You're the teacher  You figure it out  All right  I got some kind of ligament over here  I don't know what's going on  This thing is like alien 
[03:43:00]  It's drilling into the desk next to me  Call a cop  Maybe he'll throw a donut around  But you grow up  You learn to accept the hard-on  To deal with it  Accept the pee hard-on  You know  That's God's joke  You get up  You're late for work  You gotta take a squirt  And Joey's admiring the chandelier  You gotta stand there like a moron  And talk him down  Come on Joey  I dig you 
[03:43:30]  We'll dot I's and cross T's later  Work with me  Yeah the morning hard-on  I'll put that up against that  Ginsu knife any day  It'll slice  It'll dice  It'll pump your car up  If you got a flat tire  See what I'm saying cow  Heather  Hello everybody  I'm Tony Tentil  You're Fresh Gross  So we're gonna do a tip  On another squash  We're gonna do a tip  On the acorn squash  The acorn squash 
[03:44:00]  Has got this flavor to it  That is absolutely amazing  You don't have to mix it  With anything  You can make a soup of course  With it  Even desserts  But when you cut them up  And you put it in the oven  And you put a little brown sugar in there  And you bake it  For about 40 minutes  The flavor is incredible  And they're loaded  With nutritional value  Now when you select these  You wanna make sure  They have a little orange color  And green color  All the way around  And the bigger ones  Are the better ones  And make sure  They're kinda heavy  For their size  That means 
[03:44:30]  They'll have a smaller cavity  Inside there  Which means it's better  When you bake it  Because there's more there to bake  When you bring them home  Store them in a cool dry place  And I'm Tony Tentillo  Your Fresh Grosser  This is your tip for the day  And if you want a great recipe  Go to TonyTentillo.com  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio  XM satellite radio  Radio to the power of X  The Opium Anthony Show 
[03:45:00]  It's fucking stupid  The Opium Anthony Show  Oh nice  There's so much stuff  We didn't even get to today  We didn't get to  Rich Voss being success kryptonite  Everything he's attached to  Just goes down the crapper  Yeah they cancelled  Last Comic Standing  Yeah  Right before the 
[03:45:30]  The last episode  There's one episode left  One show left  And they won't even let him run that  Can we get our old friend  Jay Moore on the phone  To talk about this  Maybe tomorrow  Yeah we should  On Jay's website  It says from Jay  Last Comic Standing  Last Comic Standing is cancelled  This is shocking news to me  I woke up on Wednesday morning  And received the news  NBC was not happy  With the ratings of the show  And decided to pull the plug  Keep in mind  There's only one episode left  And on that episode  We were going to announce  The winner  Amazing  Why would a network 
[03:46:00]  Cancel a show  With only one episode left  There's some back history  That makes this more ridiculous  As Last Comic Standing 2  Was wrapping up this summer  The network told us  That they wanted a hybrid version  Of Last Comic  To put on the fall schedule  They said that they simply  Didn't have enough shows  For the fall slate  And needed a quick fix  My partner Peter Engel  As well as other producers  Like Barry Katz  Barry  Corey Fry  KP Anderson  And myself  Thought that this was a bad idea  I thought it was a bad idea too  I thought it was a little too rushed  It might have been good  If they waited  I thought it was a little too fast  After season 2 
[03:46:30]  Because Last Comic Standing 1 and 2  Had great ratings  And NBC saw that  And said well let's  Got a little greedy  Got a little greedy  There you go  We argue that having  A separate version of Last Comic  So soon after season 2  Concluded  Would burn the audience out  And damage the franchise  Well the network  Insisted we move forward  And we came up with  Last Comic Standing  Battle of the Best  Season 1 versus season 2  For a prize of 250,000 bucks  Last Comic Standing  The Battle of the Best  Hit the airwaves in the fall  And guess what  The ratings were down  The ratings stayed pretty consistent 
[03:47:00]  All season  With around 8 million viewers  But that didn't stop NBC  From hitting the panic button  The biggest question I have  Is why would you wait  Until the final episode  To pull the plug  I feel terrible for the comics  These 4 comics  Are not involved with  Network, business  Or standards and practices  But it is they  Who will suffer the most  From the terrible decision  By NBC  I have to stop typing now  Because I have to go  TiVo, father of the pride  Isn't it cool  That's not the first time  The word terrible  And Rich Voss  Have been in the same sentence  That really is awful 
[03:47:30]  I mean  Who's left?  Voss?  Alonzo?  I don't even know who's left  Alonzo de Mordal  Mordal  Jeff  John Heffron  Why would you do that  I mean especially  I want to see Voss win  Obviously because he's  My best friend  But now I want to see  Him win more  Just because he won't  Get the glory of walking  With the tiara  And the flowers  And the little sash  Yeah he'll get a call  On his 1974 Mercedes  You won  There's a check in the mail  And Voss can't even  Come on the show yet right?  Next week I think he can  Next week he can talk 
[03:48:00]  About it a little bit  I thought they had already  Like they do with these shows  Sometimes you know  Who the winner is  And they can't reveal it  Because it's been taped already  But apparently they  Were going to do  The last show live  Is that true?  They were going to do it live  So no one even knows  Who won  Like we can't call Rich  And he'd let us know  Who won  So they're going to show it  During some cartoon marathon  Or something  Are you kidding?  How do you make that decision?  How do you do that  To the people that have  Stayed with the show  And watched it?  I mean a few million people  Is a few million people  How do you not just give it  One more week?  You're saying a network  Is being a scumbag to the 
[03:48:30]  Very rare  And normally they make  Such good comedy decisions  I've seen some sitcoms  And you can sit down  With the whole family  And watch  So funny  Get a chuckle  The whole family  You know the kids  Right up into grandma  Sitting in the corner  Is laughing  A wholesome brand of humor  That's what I'm talking about Joe  I like something  And the whole family  Can sit down and watch  The Jesse Comendiquist story  There's puppies  There's little Megan  There's tears  Something for everyone  Pet the little serious puppy 
[03:49:00]  Then get smothered  I like the widow dog  On the radio  Oh my god  A lot of anger today  Living with Laurie Hacking  That'd be a nice one  See the husband come home  Pop her in the head  As she's snoring  Do you wake  Do you wake up  For that split second  And go  Oh you  Bullet in the scummer  Before he takes you 
[03:49:30]  To the dump  I love that  Just the satisfaction  You must have  Especially if you  Dismember someone  All that  That mouthy nonsense  You had to listen to  As you saw through  The femur  That's gotta be a  Very vindicating feeling  Wow  That hand  That pointed  That accusing finger  Actually just being  Cut off in the tub  You could then  Take the finger  Cut it off  And point it back  At her face  How does that feel  Miss Lau  During the game  How does that feel  Miss I won't

[03:59:00]  No masturbating  I didn't even know what masturbating was yet  And I was like 12 years old  And my mom used to make my bed  And do my laundry  And I remember I was getting ready for school  And she calls me into the room  And goes  Robert  Is there something you need to tell me today?  Yeah  Don't sit over there  Because that's still a little damp to the touch  And my mother goes  You know what happened?  You had a nocturnal emission  A what? 
[03:59:30]  A nocturnal emission  You know  And I said  No  What are you with the space program?  I'll tell you the first time I heard about masturbating  It was from my friend Alan  I was 13 years old  I was at this kid's house  And out of nowhere  He admits to me  That he jacks off in his socks  Oh yeah  Look  Girls are going  Ehhh  And the guys are like  Yeah  Sorry girls 
[04:00:00]  We can't fuck a carrot  So  He says he fucks his socks  And I'm thinking  I'm very open minded  I really am  But you know  How do you get in the mood 
[04:00:30]  To fuck your sock?  I mean  What are you on the bus  On the way home from school  Going  Hey  Wait till I get you in bed later  You're gonna get it good  You Argyle you  Take it down to the heel  You sweat sock  And you don't know me  But you know  I'm very particular  When it comes to sex  And I ain't fucking a sock  I just took off my foot  So that means

[04:01:30]  When I was 13  That the washer and dryer  Never eats your socks  I had a friend that said  Oh god  You know  It's the dryer  You must be eating my socks  No  You only fucked one sock  That's why  There's only one sock  In the dryer  It's  The other sock  Is in the dresser  Waiting to get fucked  100 channels of crystal clear  Digital audio  XM Satellite Radio
