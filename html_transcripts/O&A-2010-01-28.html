<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a prank call Mariah Carey made to her husband's radio show, followed by a segment featuring “Lawyer Ron” fielding calls.  This led into a discussion of Punxsutawney Phil and the hosts' desire to replace him with a robot.  A significant portion focused on dissecting a clip from Nick Cannon's new morning show, specifically a segment where he asked listeners about their favorite cereals, with the hosts offering commentary and jokes about Cannon's enthusiastic style.  They also played a listener's rendition of Kesha’s “Tik Tok,” focusing on the singer's apparent mental disability and her surprisingly accurate cover.  The hosts also briefly discussed Paul Shirley's controversial open letter about Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, criticizing Haitian infrastructure and birth control practices. This sparked discussion on freedom of speech and the consequences of expressing unpopular opinions, referencing other controversial figures.  A caller, Matt from Arkansas, who served in Haiti, confirmed the high rate of HIV and overpopulation.  Other callers shared their experiences in Haiti, discussed foreign aid, Jay Leno's post-Tonight Show interview, and a series of sex scandals at a Brooklyn high school.  Debbie from Long Island also called to discuss her and her husband's pornography use.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the new Apple iPad, with the hosts expressing skepticism about its cost and limitations compared to the iPhone and Kindle.  A call-in segment followed, with listeners sharing their opinions on the iPad and their experiences with Apple products.  Callers included Garth, who detailed his numerous broken iPhones, and Mr. D, who suggested the iPad as a device for the elderly.  One caller commented on Steve Jobs' gaunt appearance, and another pointed out incriminating evidence on Anthony's old iPhones.  The conversation then moved to the State of the Union address, focusing on the partisan reactions and the hosts' highly offensive comments about Nancy Pelosi. They also criticized Obama's use of a teleprompter and the lack of bipartisan cooperation.  Callers shared their economic struggles and frustrations with Obama's economic policies.  Striker, a caller, shared a personal anecdote about a car accident and its financial consequences.

Later, the hosts discussed their former colleague Nick Cannon's new morning show, criticizing his apparent lack of radio experience and the hiring of a talent coach. They mentioned Cannon's cereal segment and promised to reveal the results after a break.  The conversation then shifted to a discussion of a female teacher having sexual relations with a student, leading to calls from listeners sharing similar stories and details about drug use and theft at James Madison High School in Brooklyn. The discussion then moved to the rise of 3D movies, spurred by *Avatar*, with speculation on its impact on filmmaking.  Humorous tangents included a discussion of wanting to "motorboat" Hermione Granger from Harry Potter.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a heated argument between comedians Joe DeRosa and Bobby Kelly, concerning the exclusion of Jim Norton from a film project.  The hosts facilitated the argument, adding commentary and humorous observations.  Numerous offensive tweets directed at DeRosa fueled the dispute.  Roland, a regular listener, briefly appeared to discuss seeing the premiere of *Lost* and his unemployment. A new Ron the Lawyer commercial was played, and the segment concluded with the hosts mentioning an upcoming two-minute meeting with management.  The show also included mention of the deaths of Zelda Rubinstein and the arrest of Chris Jericho.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts used frequent offensive language and made numerous off-color jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's roll.  I don't know.  Because they're dummies.  Who's dummy?  Hi, everybody.  Who's dummy?  Apple, at times.  Really?  They seem to be a very successful company.  I know, but sometimes they pull bonehead moves.  I'm not talking about the iPad.  Totally.  The iPad released yesterday by Apple.  Not released, but kind of...  Unveiled?  Unveiled.  Yeah, they did the little conference there and showed the bells and whistles that it has. 
[00:00:30]  And I was left going, huh?  Well...  Why?  You just don't get it.  I don't?  No.  I don't get it.  Oh, it's a building.  It's a ball.  No, you don't get it.  No, who's excited is Closer to Kenny.  Why?  Because they finally made an iPhone that he could use.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  It's Kenny's iPhone.  Oh, it's perfect size for me.  What are they calling it?  What did you guys say about the... 
[00:01:00]  Well, I was calling the iPhone the iPad mini.  Yeah, the iPad mini.  There you go.  That's what it says.  Now the iPad mini I have, and it seems to do a little more than the iPad, and it's smaller,  and, like, here's another thing.  I don't want to pay for another 3G account from AT&T.  Fucking amazing.  That idiot Steve Jobs would go with AT&T again.  He's not an idiot.  He's a very successful businessman.  He's a dope.  It's like, so now I've got to pay another bill? 
[00:01:30]  If I get this thing, I've got to pay another bill to AT&T so I can get, you know, connected  with this thing?  And then, again, they fucking leave Flash out.  Flash is a, you know, video format that a lot of people use.  It's high quality.  It's low space.  It doesn't take up a lot of room.  And where is it?  And this doesn't even have it.  Oh, he said it. 
[00:02:00]  He goes, they're breaking into the book industry, the fucking computer book industry.  I mean, I've been reading up on it a little bit, and I got a Kindle, and, you know, I  could download books and stuff, and when you've had a Kindle for a while, you kind of, and  it has the Wi-Fi connection, you kind of wish you could do a little more.  And I think that's sort of what he's going for here.  That could be what they're going for.  It's like the Kindle-type reading thing, but it does a little more.  That's my two cents on it.  Is that what we're doing on TV or no?  Yeah, that's it. 
[00:02:30]  It is cool, but it's just a big fucking iPhone.  How stupid.  It's a giant iPhone.  It really is a giant iPhone.  With AT&T again.  It just, they make me sick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, uh, I don't get it also because, all right, look, I could have, uh,  a small laptop, I could have a small MacBook or something like that, or I could have an  iPhone.  Like, this is an in-the-middle thing where you, you'd be left wanting one or the other.  You want the laptop or you want the iPhone, what's in either one, and you're not getting 
[00:03:00]  either, you're kind of getting a piece of this and a piece of that.  Like, all right, I want to watch a movie.  What do I got to do?  Fucking hold the thing up like a picture?  Mm-hmm.  And look at it the whole time if I'm watching a movie?  Mm-hmm.  Or, or, and then it docks with, like, a keyboard or something, but that's called a laptop.  Uh, it's, it looks like they-  That doesn't get flash.  It looks like they lost their mind and went back, they went backwards with their technology.  Unless, unless this is another prime example, and I think it is, of Apple being, being geniuses, 
[00:03:30]  by the way, which they do.  They put this out.  This is the first one.  And they already know what phase two and three and four is going to look like, so that you  get to throw it away and buy a new one.  Well, Apple's great with that, with their pre-planned obsolescence.  I mean, they know what they're doing.  It's amazing how many iPhones I fucking have sitting in a pile in a drawer, because the  next one comes out, and I'm like, oh, I need that.  So why don't you throw the other iPhones away, you hoarder?  Because-  Are you an iPhone hoarder? 
[00:04:00]  Because I-  Fast forward another three years, and we walk through Anthony's house.  We can't even find them.  They're just piled all over the place.  There's those guys from the fucking TV show with shovels, snow shoveling out my used iPhones  and iPads.  Well, why don't we, we got a minute 30 clip here of the iPad, so let's see if we're covering  everything.  After months of rumor and speculation, Apple has unveiled the iPad, its tablet-based computer,  larger in size, but similar in design to the iPhone. 
[00:04:30]  CEO Steve Jobs calls the device more intimate than a laptop and more capable than a smartphone.  The iPad is an awesome way to enjoy your music collection, and of course, we have the iTunes  store built right into the iPad, so you can discover music, you can purchase it, movies,  TV shows, podcasts, iTunes University, everything built right into the iPad.  And on the way, whoo, tablet computers have existed for years, but persuading consumers 
[00:05:00]  that this is a must-have device could prove to be a challenge.  One of the questions and one of the challenges I think they're going to have is separating  the functionality of this device from maybe one of the lighter Apple laptops that are  currently in the market, and that could create some conflict, particularly at the price points  we're talking about.  And for all the hype and anticipation surrounding the iPad, some analysts fail to see the excitement  and familiar functionality in a different form.  I mean, I don't think this product is as exciting as, say, the iPhone. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, the iPod, the iPhone, these products revolutionized their spaces.  This product, I don't necessarily think will.  Still, Apple has a reputation of building on and enhancing its previous successes, and for  some, those enhancements make all the difference.  The iPad has a 9.7-inch touchscreen, is a half-inch thick, and weighs one and a half pounds, with  basic models starting at $499.  Optional 3G connectivity adds about $130 to the base price, and pay-as-you-go data plans will  be available from AT&T. 
[00:06:00]  It just sounds like it's like an entertainment tablet, where you could read books, listen  to music, watch movies.  Very good.  I mean, because we all had the portable DVD player, and the iPod, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  And you're carrying your book now, it all could be in this one thing.  To get Wi-Fi?  Yeah, it has to get Wi-Fi.  I'm laughing, it's like, it better fucking get Wi-Fi.  Don't tell me this is going to be like the fucking MacBook Air, whatever that was.  Yeah.  The Mac Air, where it was a great, like, luxury item that meant nothing, and will go 
[00:06:30]  away.  Because this really, unless it's laptop size, and it is a laptop that's this thin, it's  meaningless.  This is perfect for the business guy that's traveling a lot.  You throw it in your backpack, and you watch a movie on it, you do a little of the internet,  and a little of that stuff.  But mostly it's for entertainment.  You know, the wonderful Borgata was lovely enough to send me a MacBook Air.  However, they sent me one, and it was wonderful.  What do you mean?  But they?  Yeah, yeah.  They just sent me one as a gift.  Your house? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  I got a box one day, and I'm like...  I thought you meant that they gave it to you for the weekend or something.  No, no, no.  They had a present.  They just said...  What?  Mr. Kumia, we thank you for your...  They want their money back.  Your patronage and blah, blah, blah.  Don't...  Here is a gift for you.  So they gave me a MacBook Air.  And I do use it, but the only time I use it is, let's say, it's because it stays in  my bedroom.  Right.  So when I'm downstairs and I go, I'm getting tired, but I'm in the middle of like a poker  game, an online poker game, I'll fire that thing up, do that, maybe some pictures, 
[00:07:30]  a little jacking.  It's a good jacking book.  They should call it the Jack Book.  Because that's pretty much what it's good for.  But why wouldn't I just have that instead of...  You know, the keyboard that folds over on top, if anything else, it protects the screen.  Like, how does this thing...  Did they address the fact that it has an exposed screen, which is hard enough on your iPhone,  you're scared to put it in the same pocket with your keys or something. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Where are you going to carry this?  Right.  In a backpack or something?  They have cases.  Yeah, they have the cases.  Yeah, a full line of accessories have already been announced.  Uh-oh, how are they?  Full line of accessories.  Full line of accessories.  It all comes prepared the same way.  It's a business tool, mostly.  I don't know why it is.  Or I guess if you're just sitting around, you could just kind of have it on your knees,  on a couch, and just kind of do your thing.  They need to get a thing you prop it up with, though.  Like you said, I like people holding their iPhones.  Right.  No, but like, you know, like your hands start shaking after a while. 
[00:08:30]  No, that's inconvenient.  But you wouldn't prop up your newspaper, you know what I mean?  Or you prop up your book.  That's what they're going for.  It's a tablet.  It's like you hold it.  And you know what I mean?  Yeah.  And that's been a huge topic of discussion, too.  Where, you know, for a few weeks now, leading up to this announcement, people have been  saying, well, how am I supposed to hold it?  Yeah.  How am I supposed to use it?  Right.  And it's funny, because a lot of the Photoshopped mock-ups that people did, like as a goof,  is actually the way that Apple intends for you to use it.  It's a little strange that way.  Yeah, because I can't see. 
[00:09:00]  All right, you're not going to use it to do all sorts of stuff you would do on a laptop.  So you're on a plane, you're watching a movie.  Right.  What are you going to do?  Like, lay it down on your tray and watch it at a 45-degree angle?  Or do you have to hold it for two hours?  That's the problem.  Or is there, like, one of those things from a picture frame that pulls out the back?  I don't...  You can angle it.  How about a laptop?  There's, like, a dock that's maybe, like, you know, three or four inches wide.  What's up with that?  Get it?  I do.  What's up? 
[00:09:30]  Ah, what's up, dock?  You like tablets, dock?  What's up, dock?  Yeah.  Besides from that, like, how are you going to...  Yeah, but if it's docked, you might as well have a laptop and watch your movie on a fucking plane with your laptop.  So I guess people aren't as excited about this as they were excited about the iPhone.  No, I don't see the lines being formed when this comes out.  I don't see that.  I mean, it's going to be kind of a novelty item.  I think maybe in some art house shit they might be able to use these in meetings if they're trading back and forth some Photoshop ideas for some fucking product. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  I'm just going to say it over and over again.  They just went after the Kindle market.  They see that the Kindle was selling incredibly well.  Barnes & Noble has their version.  So it's a Kindle Plus.  I would say a Kindle Plus.  That's what I'm thinking.  But the problem is they don't have the same technology as the Kindle.  Because the Kindle, you could read it without...  There's no false light on the Kindle.  Thank you.  There's no LED.  Yeah, it's a new technology. 
[00:10:30]  Shit.  Which is better for your eyes.  So you could take a Kindle, you know, to the beach and just read it, like, easily with no glare.  Yeah, and what about if it's a little dark in the room?  You have to get an external light.  That's the problem.  Oh, is it?  Okay.  So you're saying the Kindle's better on the eyes than the way it works on the backlit?  Yeah.  You say, like, if you read a whole book on the iPad, you're going to look like Governor  Patterson.  Probably.  You're going to have some twitchy eyes.  I actually have an extra light I bought for travel.  Like, a little...  It's a little... 
[00:11:00]  No!  It's fascinating.  A little book light?  I clip it onto my ear and I loop it around like it's a Madonna microphone and I read.  Jesus.  And I look at my own molars in the mirror.  Very good!  Garth in Indiana.  Garth?  Good morning, workhorses.  What the fuck's going on?  Hi, guys.  Tomorrow's our workhorse day because we work Friday.  What are you on, character?  Hey, first of all, Anthony, goddammit, you sound like such a rich asshole.  I got a fucking drawer full of iPhones?  Yeah.  Get me up, man.  Look, let me tell you something. 
[00:11:30]  It is because I love the iPhone.  I really do.  It has some of its downfalls.  It doesn't have Flash, which I'm upset about.  But I love the iPhone and I have a drawer full because...  One of them fell...  I was pushed into the pool when I had it on me and iPhones do not go with water very well.  The second one was in my pocket when I went into the hot tub and realized 10 minutes later that it was in the pool.  And then the third one... 
[00:12:00]  The situation?  I fucking suck.  I know.  And then the third one got obsolete.  It came out with video on the newer ones, so I had to go out and buy that one.  So, yes, I have three garbage iPhones and one that I use.  I'm going through two Blackberries a year now.  Yeah.  I was never a tech guy.  What else, Garth?  Yeah.  Hey, so, yesterday morning this time, Opie, you said, how the hell are we going to top Tuesday's show with Ozzy? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Well, goddammit, yesterday with that fucking lawyer, Jets fan lawyer.  Yeah.  Fucking hilarious, man.  Just great show.  Yeah, I was telling the guys, I've never gotten so much feedback on my Twitter over a guest like I did after Ron the lawyer left.  Unbelievable.  He'll be a regular on the show.  We're just trying to figure out how to work him into the mix.  I want Ron, I know how to work him into the mix.  I want to just bring Ron in every day.  I want him to live with me in my living room and just call me Character.  That's all I want to do is say. 
[00:13:00]  What's your name, Character?  Character.  Character.  What do you do, Character?  Character.  Have you ever been institutionalized?  Yeah.  Institutionalized?  You sound like an asshole, like a lot of judges, Character.  Character.  Did you see the video?  No, then go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Really?  You mad at me because your wife didn't give you a blowjob this morning?  What's the matter?  Can't get it up?  What's wrong, Character?  You know who he reminded me of?  The fucking drill sergeant in Stripes.  Oh, yeah.  That laugh.  War notes.  He sounded like war notes.  Absolutely.  Lighten up, Francis. 
[00:13:30]  I think they're getting a few clips of the young lawyer.  Well, E-Rock asked.  I said, yeah, I figured it would be in front of me to start the show.  It's not.  Sergeant Holka.  Yeah.  Sergeant Holka, right.  And a little bit.  Say jump.  Why don't you say hi?  Character.  Character.  Character.  His head.  I wish you guys could have seen it because he was sitting on the couch and he looked like  a man who was just grieving.  His fucking, he's got an elbow on his knee and his hand is on his forehead and he's just  talking to the mic.  Not looking at anybody, just head ducked down. 
[00:14:00]  What a sicko.  And the father, who was also an attorney, the Roger Daltrey looking dad, keeps elbowing  him.  It was so funny.  It was like watching a married couple where one is drinking too heavily at the party.  It was a codependent relationship with his attorney.  Absolutely.  And they used to work together.  You can tell.  It's obvious why they don't work together anymore.  Ab so fucking lutely.  That was fun.  I was, I'm sure that'll be part of the countdown this weekend.  I would imagine that's going to be number one.  I can't, I can't imagine what's going to beat that one. 
[00:14:30]  Uh, all right, Garth.  We'll try though.  I think today's going to be a dud of a show though.  I mean, we can't keep this up.  Nah, nah, nah.  We can't keep this quality up.  Are you kidding?  Quality.  We'll try, but I don't know.  Uh, let's say it.  All right, brother.  Let's say hi to Mr. D in Jersey.  Mr. D.  How you doing, Doctor?  Hey.  What's up, character?  Character?  So, uh.  Character?  Almost sounds like Bush a little bit too.  Can he use this thing as a jitterbug?  What?  Oh.  Can he use this iPad as a jitterbug?  Jitterbug.  The old people's big button phone. 
[00:15:00]  That thing is hysterical.  Hey, that's a good line, Mr. D.  All I need is the jitterbug.  That's a good line.  One big 911 button in the middle.  That's fucking, that's all you need, a poor lady.  Grab this if having stroke, heart attack, or man of color is breaking in through your patio.  The jitterbug.  Does anyone have an iPad around here yet?  Uh.  They're not out yet.  No, they're not out yet.  Okay, I don't know.  No, they're not out yet.  Rick Voss uses an iPhone, that's how it feels.  Because he has little turtle feet fingers. 
[00:15:30]  Tiny little ants.  Tom in Delaware.  Good evening.  Hey.  Hey, character.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love you.  Hey, I don't know if you guys noticed, but yesterday during the presentation, when they  were talking about this iPad, the only thing I can think about is how much Steve Jobs looks  like a zombie.  You know what, though?  He came back from death.  He did.  He looked worse the last press conference.  Yeah, you got to give him some credit, man.  That guy came back from death.  Damn.  He was checking out.  Did you notice how his clothes are, like, 7X and he's clearly, like, a small... 
[00:16:00]  Well, he's trying to, like, cover up, I guess.  Oh, cover up.  Skin and bones.  Clothing.  Skin and bones.  Poor guy.  Look at how he looked in 98, and that's 10 years later.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bill in South Carolina.  Bill.  Jesus.  Picket day off.  Bill.  Hello.  Bill.  He's gone.  All right.  Let's say hi to Zach in Atlanta.  Just going around the country a little bit here.  Zach.  Yeah.  I just wanted to point out something. 
[00:16:30]  Anthony can't really throw phones away.  There's some incriminating evidence, like little young ladies, pitchers, maybe, that probably  shouldn't just be thrown away anywhere.  What?  Oh, he had a good concept, though.  Yeah.  And then he turns the radio up.  How do I do?  Maybe I do better when I listen on the radio.  Yeah.  Maybe the laughs are blocking the studio.  Maybe they sweeten it in post-production.  Basically, you're scared to throw the iPhones away. 
[00:17:00]  There might be some, you know, some pics on there.  Some pics and some pegs.  Well, the two of the phones are completely, you know, trashed.  Never really.  Never get that back.  Get to CSI.  All right, let's see what we can find out.  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike?  Mike?  Good morning, Mike.  Good morning, Mike.  Hey, Ant.  You degenerate gambling fuck.  I was wondering if you watched the State of the Union address last night.  Ah, the State of the Union.  Yes, of course. 
[00:17:30]  Did you watch?  Wouldn't miss it.  I watched.  Yeah, you got to watch it.  A couple observations.  Obama's going gray, like we've said.  Oh, yeah.  It's happening fast.  And I don't like where one side of the room claps and the other side just sits down.  That's always the way.  How are we supposed to get anything done down there in Washington?  That's a prime example of how things work, like when they're talking with each other.  Right.  One side's all rah-rah about the thing and the other side's rah-rah-rah.  How do you watch the same event and one side gives you a standing ovation and the other 
[00:18:00]  side sits on their hands?  Because they are not going to endorse his policies.  But doesn't it show you how phony and full of shit they are?  Like how partisan and biased everybody is?  But there have been State of the Union addresses where a president has gotten up and both sides  have, you know, given him a rah-rah.  Not on every subject.  Yeah, he had a little rah-rah on both sides.  But for the most part...  Well, when he talked about middle class tax cuts for smaller businesses and stuff, then  the right stood up and, you know, clapped for him. 
[00:18:30]  But everything else, his health care thing, poof, they weren't even cracking a smile sitting  there.  I must not even acknowledge that he talked.  Obama was kind of funny.  I forgot what point he was making where, you know, all his boys were standing up clapping.  I call them all his boys.  His boys.  Standing up, giving him the standing ovation and nothing from the other side.  And he kind of turned and pointed.  Did you see this?  And he goes, I thought I'd get a couple of you to clap on that one.  Yeah.  He really is a card. 
[00:19:00]  He is a character.  Character?  You know, he could go off the reading device.  For a second.  He could go off the Kindle for a little bit.  They don't trust him, though, more than a couple of seconds.  One little line.  He gets a laugh.  Back to the teleprompter.  Yeah, back to the...  Look at the words.  Look at the scrolling words, sir.  Well, we picked out our best parts of the State of the Union.  Oh, yeah?  It's quick.  We got five.  Five little clips here.  Fucking Pelosi sitting behind him. 
[00:19:30]  I can't look at that pig.  Who, Harry Dean Stanton?  That fucking...  I can't even fucking look at her.  How powerful is she?  I'm disgusted.  She's the Speaker of the fucking House.  She's very powerful.  That's insane.  Look, you got one.  The other guy.  That's one, two, three, right?  There's three, right?  There's old Joe.  And there's three right there.  That fucking lump of shit.  That lump of shit.  Just unplug the goddamn bitch.  I can't stand her.  I don't think you should be able to be president if you get your nails done. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, no.  I don't know.  Right from the second we saw it.  Maybe I'm old school on some things.  Because I don't know.  If you go to the parlor and you get your hair done, all, you know, up nice, I don't think  you should be president.  The beauty parlor.  Ever since we first saw it banging the gavel all stupidly.  Right.  Yeah!  With a screechy voice.  Yeah.  And she...  I don't know what Obama feels he owes her.  Like, her popularity is lower than Obama's.  And Obama's is plummeting.  Can he just say, beat it, sister? 
[00:20:30]  No.  She's kind of, you know, in there.  And she'll be there because, you know, she's the darling of San Francisco, so she's not  going anywhere.  Them fruities will vote her in every time.  How do you know when to stand?  They'll lose the majority, and she, you know, she'll lose it, but what happens?  We'll see.  Let's see what happens.  Charlie in Philly has a little observation about the State of the Union.  Charlie!  Hey, morning, boys.  What's up, Charlie?  Hey, when did, all of a sudden, did the State of the Union address become Catholic Church? 
[00:21:00]  Stand sit, stand sit, kneel sit, kneel sit, kneel sit, kneel sit, stand, stand, clap, clap?  I, what?  Oh, my God.  Dude, I would go to...  It's horrible.  I would go to church more if I could just sit down and just hang, man.  I mean, the standing, the kneeling, then you got to, then the thing that you kneel  on, you got to put that back up so you can stand up.  Pull it back out.  And then you have to pull it back down because you got to kneel again.  It's like, can I just sit here, please?  I'm just going to sit and watch.  Yeah.  And there's always, with the First Lady or something, there's always, like, the local 
[00:21:30]  hero.  Like, one year it was the subway hero.  Oh, yes, yes.  And this year it's the cops, I think, that shot the Fort Hood shooter, which, amazing,  the Army still just doesn't acknowledge that it was an act of terrorism by an Islamic militant.  No.  You know, so they always have the person of interest at the State of Union.  Did they do?  Was that up?  I'll just look at the paper.  The First Lady was sitting near?  Yeah, I'm sure that they got the bipartisan standing.  All right.  Yes, of course.  Yes.  Let's go to Ken in New Hampshire.  Ken?  How we going, guys?  Hey, Ken.  How much snow you got up there?  I miss New Hampshire. 
[00:22:00]  I used to skate in New Hampshire.  I really don't have to do more.  No?  No, it's been pretty warm the last week, but...  Global warming.  Global warming is back.  Global warming.  It took a break, but it's back.  All right.  Yeah, I hope you guys talked about it.  The other day on the Daily Show, John Stewart made fun of Obama because when he spoke to  sixth graders, he brought teleprompters in with him.  It's hilarious.  You've got to look up the clip.  Yeah, we were talking about...  I don't think that one made the air because we talk about stuff during the breaks, too,  and then we forget that we should probably tell the masses. 
[00:22:30]  But Anthony was all over that going, why does he have to use a teleprompter?  At a little, you know, school there for sixth graders.  I mean, even stupid George Bush just talked to students.  He didn't need the teleprompters there.  You're talking like fucking kids in school.  Just wing it.  Or have, you know, an outline and then get up there and just talk.  I don't get it.  Well, what was he telling the sixth graders that he had a...  Ah, stay in school, get an education, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:23:00]  Can't you just say that?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of dumb.  The people around him seem to be a little dumb because you've got to realize if Obama  goes into a classroom and talks in this manner, people are going to pick up on it and kind  of beat him up for it, right?  Yes.  You've got to, like, think ahead a little bit.  And they've been beating him up for that and, like, completely U-turning on his policies.  He spent about, I guess, almost three-quarters of the time of the State of the Union on the 
[00:23:30]  economy, which now he knows is the public's biggest interest.  Let's get the economy back.  Let's get jobs back.  And, boy, he really backed off on health care a bit, didn't he?  He talked about, you know, the fact that we still need it and, you know, Democrats are  still very into getting a health care plan passed.  But this is nothing like his past speeches before the Massachusetts election.  Right.  That the Democrat was blown out.  Right.  Where he would just stand there, health care, health care.  And now he's talking about, you know, hey, we need jobs. 
[00:24:00]  We need this.  Oh, really?  Mr. 10% fucking unemployment?  Now you're talking about jobs?  They're saying that 10% is a lot higher, though, right?  Of course it is.  Yeah, of course.  Well, he probably figures that he doesn't want to waste the next three years trying to  get the health care thing done and maybe give up on that a little bit so he can get some  things accomplished.  Three years?  He doesn't want to waste until November when all of his buddies are gone if he keeps harping  on health care.  And then at that point, then we just got a sitting duck president for the next two years.  Lame duck, sitting duck. 
[00:24:30]  Well, he's sitting.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  Jesus.  Sitting duck.  Wow.  Lame duck.  Wow.  That's a Freudian stuff there.  Hello.  Mr. Sirhan.  Wow.  Sorry about that.  Lame duck, of course.  Sitting duck.  That's perfect.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  I like the guy.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning, boys.  Yeah.  Hey, I got two things for you.  Yep.  Obama said there were tax cuts for 95% of the middle class. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Well, I just finished my taxes.  I'm 99.9% done with them.  What does that mean?  Yeah.  I'm waiting for one form that will come in the mail.  That's the big tax cut.  Oh, oh.  Because I made $10,000 less last year than I did the previous year.  Had the exact same expenses, exact same tax withholdings for my paycheck.  And I owe $1,500 more. 
[00:25:30]  This will be the first year I've not gotten a refund on my tax.  Well, Obama fans will tell you that it's, look at your state taxes and your local taxes.  Those are the ones that went off.  Obama didn't do anything.  Meanwhile, all those people took Obama's lead in saying, all right, well, the president's doing this.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to set the same criteria as this $200,000 a year and over is rich, no matter where you live.  Like, I think there should be a little more of a gate.  If you're making $200,000 a year and you live in West Virginia somewhere, you are making a pretty damn good living. 
[00:26:00]  You live in Manhattan?  No.  Sorry.  You're not rich.  That's a bit different.  Striker, I've got to ask you, if you don't mind, how much money do you make a year about?  My wife and I combined last year made $61,000.  The previous year we made $71,000.  So, combined, you guys are making $61,000 and you're not getting a tax refund?  No, they're not getting a break.  That's fucking insane.  No, I have no.  And it's just to us.  We don't have kids.  But we have, you know, I mean, we have like $18,000 in medical expenses because my wife was hurt early in the year really bad. 
[00:26:30]  So, we had a massive medical bill.  Well, Striker, what happened to her, man?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, she was in a car accident and eventually we'll get some of the money back once the lawsuit settles.  But what happened to her in a car accident?  Oh, just a lot of really bad broken bones.  And she actually has a little bit of mental, almost like a PTSD type situation because she refuses to drive now because she's so scared shitless from the accident. 
[00:27:00]  You should have hit it, you faggot.  I can't.  I can't.  Hold on.  He had his finger on the button and everything.  Let me say it.  I can't.  The story just started getting to me somewhere in the room.  Absolutely.  It is kind of.  We all have our soft spots.  I lost a dad to a car accident.  And I think that's what got to me right there.  But, hold on.  Is she still suffering from ramifications or from the thing or is it done? 
[00:27:30]  No, she's still suffering.  Jimmy's walking over to my side.  And he's, uh...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's not the one I usually play, though.  The big laugh.  Obi's finger was on the button.  It really was, Striker.  Like it was the Cuban Missile Crisis.  It was that close to nuclear war.  I pardoned you.  Yeah.  I pardoned you.  I did.  And I hit the wrong button like I don't...  I hit the one, the empathy button.  Come on.  Look, man.  We all got our soft spots. 
[00:28:00]  What can I tell you?  Hey, uh...  Yes.  One final thing.  Yeah.  I thought it was kind of interesting.  Obama's talking about how the economy's doing better.  And a local Ford dealership here in Denver that supported Obama.  The owner supported him.  Closed their doors yesterday.  240 people lost their jobs.  No kidding.  That's great.  Yeah.  So much for the economy.  And then he goes, and I want to pass a jobs bill.  And everyone's like, oh, yay, yay.  And it's like, what does that mean?  Yeah, what is a jobs bill?  And what does that mean? 
[00:28:30]  So all the Democrats get together.  They go back into their hidden room.  They come up with a jobs bill that's full of pork and fucking earmarks and all kinds of other shit.  Oh, oh, oh.  So nothing gets done.  Just enough.  I thought we were talking about Apple again.  Oh.  A Steve Jobs bill.  A Jobs bill.  Jobs bill.  You know, one of your guys' biggest listing base is us truckers.  And, you know, if you ask the majority of the truckers to call, I think the majority of us will tell you the same thing. 
[00:29:00]  We're hurting.  We're not working like we used to.  I mean, I'm working three and four days a week.  You know, because there's just no freight out here.  Everyone.  I don't think less this year than I did last year either.  I don't know anybody that's making more money than they were making a couple of years ago.  I just don't.  Sure.  And that's people that have jobs.  Yeah.  There are people that just aren't working.  But no one's.  Well, perhaps the king is.  What's that?  Perhaps the king down the hall is.  Oh, yeah.  The king.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, well, yeah, you know.  The glorious king. 
[00:29:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  A striker.  But, I mean, you should be getting a refund.  You know, that nice little check at what?  About $400 or $500?  I was hoping for about $1,500.  $1,500 would be nice.  But, like, even $400 or $500, you'd do a little something with the surprise money.  I was such, when I used to get refunds, when I was a tin knocker, I was an en-rich mother  of all, was I just, fuck it, like my mommy used to call it.  Dude, I started treating everybody for, like, two days straight, and then I was right back 
[00:30:00]  where I was.  Oh, I was just broke again.  I'd sit there and go, yeah, and I'd have to go to a bank, like, some bank that would  cash it, because I didn't even have an account.  I didn't even have a bank account.  Know who got my tax refund year after year, believe it or not?  Red Lobster.  Really?  You were styling.  I was a big Red Lobster guy for a while.  Before it went, you know.  Before it went, you know.  Yeah.  You know.  You know.  You know.  You know what I love about the Red Lobster commercials and other commercials, like those  really cheesy chain restaurant commercials? 
[00:30:30]  I never thought Red Lobster was cheesy.  For real.  You don't at the time.  You're Long Island trash at the time.  Is it cheesy, though?  I was.  I did the same thing.  I'm going to a Red Lobster this weekend.  I want to see if it's cheesy.  See how it is?  Because I remember it as a, like a five-star restaurant.  That's all I knew.  I'm not even kidding.  It is.  If you're Long Island trash.  I was in the same boat, dude.  That's where I brought my dates.  I'm like, hey, I'm treating you to a Red Lobster.  Me and the ex-wife used to go to Red Lobster on, like, special occasions. 
[00:31:00]  It's like, yep.  We're going to Red Lobster tonight.  That's right.  It was amazing.  And then we'd go there and have their crappy food and thing.  It was great.  Is the seafood edible there?  Like, is it healthy?  I mean, like, you're not going to get sick from it.  Healthy.  Everything is, like, boiled in butter.  Oh, yeah.  And it's just.  They butter it up for you.  Well, I just got to bring up the commercials for Red Lobster.  Sure, sure, sure.  If you watch them in a lot of these chain restaurants, they show, like, and this tasty  grilled scallops with bacon.  And the camera has to be two inches away from the skewers to make it look any bigger than 
[00:31:30]  it really is.  It's like the scallops are the size of, like, a nickel.  I do remember the shrimp was a bit on the small side.  They showed on a skewer, and they're zoomed in on this thing, and they don't want to show  the hands even holding the skewer.  Have you ever had a shrimp as big as your hand?  How great is that?  Oh, fantastic.  There's nothing better than a shrimp that is as big as your fucking hand.  A shrimp like a piece of watermelon.  Yeah.  Just laying into it. 
[00:32:00]  But that.  Fantastic.  Well, the famous story, and this is true, I liked this girl when I was in Geneseo, and  I drove her home to, well, she lived north of Syracuse, and we went to a Red Lobster.  Oh, styling.  And she was a bit thin.  She was a little on the thin side, and we feasted at Red Lobster, and she went into the  bathroom and came back very teary-eyed.  Oh, no.  That's when I learned that she likes to throw up her food.  I'm like, oh, this is great.  Maybe that's why you had to hang your hand out the window. 
[00:32:30]  It wasn't your hand.  It wasn't your pussy dog.  That was a different girl.  Did you see how close the camera was?  We were just watching a commercial.  You're right.  How close the camera is to the food.  And then they show it with tongs and forks and spoons.  They rarely ever show a hand because, look, see, they don't want to give it a scale.  Right.  So how would you pick that up anyway?  Like, look how small that is.  That is a tiny piece of shit.  They don't want to show it.  Ah, they're going to bump into it with the lens.  They don't want to show you on the skewer. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Skewer.  Character.  Character.  Character.  Character.  Skewer.  Yeah, so she came back from the bathroom with the teary eyeballs.  Yeah.  I think she...  She finally admitted.  I'm like, oh, that's...  Okay, that's your issue.  Great.  She had a vomit.  Great.  Lucky me.  Another girl with an issue.  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  A little baggage full of vomit?  I said beat it.  Beat it, stupid.  Yeah.  Get somebody else with baggage.  I had...  But I had the girl that used to puke, and then I had the girl that got fat. 
[00:33:30]  What the fuck?  All within one semester.  When?  Well, I told you about the one...  We would go back to my room at the dorm after a night of drinking and stuff, and she  was just obsessed with eating.  I'm like, yeah, all right, whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll get a pizza.  And she would just wolf the whole thing down.  She was like an average-sized girl.  She was fine.  I'm like, yeah, all right, whatever.  So I'm thinking, wow, she ate a lot of pizza probably because we were drunk and needs to  soak up some alcohol.  Next thing you know, she took a semester off.  I told this story a few times.  Then I'm walking down Main Street in Geneseo, and this big monster comes running toward me 
[00:34:00]  all excited because I haven't seen this girl in, I don't know, like six to nine months,  whatever it would be.  And it was the same girl, unrecognizable.  She literally gained, I don't know, 80 pounds?  Really?  Where I didn't even recognize her anymore.  Oh, you got a lawyer on calls.  Cool.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Jeff the Trucker.  Jeff?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Opie, I just want to tell you, you better call ahead and make sure you get that fucking 
[00:34:30]  shrimp from Indiana.  The Indiana shrimp, yeah.  Gotta love the Indiana shrimp.  Yeah.  Hey, and by the way, the hockey update is six to eight weeks.  He's got a broken jaw and teeth troubles.  Yeah, you know what?  Thanks, Jeff.  I figured I'd...  I don't know how much hockey these people want to listen to, but...  A broken jaw?  We told the story of Hillen, the Islander guy who took a puck right to his front teeth, 
[00:35:00]  the top teeth it looked like.  Yeah.  Slap shot, I don't know, the guy was 10, 15 feet away, and there's the update from Jeff.  Six to eight weeks, he broke his jaw in it.  Yeah, he broke his jaw and knocked teeth out of his head.  Well, teeth problems.  Who knows what that means?  They could all be loose at this point.  The problem is they were laying on the ice.  What a...  And now we're fucked.  The Islanders are fucked.  Because we're a little light on defense to begin with, and now we lost Hillen, who's  a soldier.  Yeah, he's a soldier out there.  It's not good for the team.  I think we're in trouble as far as the playoffs go for now. 
[00:35:30]  Let's go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Alana.  When the subject of Red Lobster came up, Ant didn't mention his favorite demographic,  but down here, I guess it would be comparable to Popeye's up north.  That's all that goes there.  Yeah, apparently, Red Lobster became a very popular place with the brothers to take their 
[00:36:00]  baby mama or a date or something like that, and it became very popular with the homies.  What did that change?  Because I used to go to Red Lobster a lot in the late 80s, I would guess.  Maybe a little early 90s, and I don't remember brothers all over the joint.  No, it was, like I said, Long Island, white trash.  But then again, I don't see color.  Well, that's true.  You've always been that way.  That's right, Anthony.  I can tell.  During every commercial break, you never join in on the racist shenanigans that go on in 
[00:36:30]  this studio.  Okay, sometimes you do.  Actually, look, I'm human.  I like a good N-word joke like the rest of them.  I'm just a man.  I'm just a racist like you.  Ah, fuck.  Every single person listening to our voices right now is racist in one form or another.  Yeah.  You've got your hardcore racist, and then you've got your subtle racist.  Yep.  But everyone has racism in them. 
[00:37:00]  I truly believe that.  Do you want to hear what a retired cop's dealing with?  Mike in North Carolina.  Mike!  Mike!  Hey, what's up, boys?  That's your intro.  I'm listening to Striker.  You know, I retired in 2003.  I get $33,000 from the fucking city for doing 20 years to break my ass in fucking Brooklyn  and the 72nd Precinct.  So I got a job in North Carolina, too, for the state.  I make about $23,000. 
[00:37:30]  I owe about $7,000 every fucking year.  Every year.  They fucking rape me.  The state sucks.  I hate North Carolina, but my ex-wife took my kids here, so that's why I'm here.  But, you know, I know that he fucked over the richer people or people he says are richer,  but he's fucking everybody over.  Because I don't make shit no more.  I make about $60,000 if that, and I swear I owe about $5,000 to the fucking feds, and 
[00:38:00]  I owe $2,000 to the shit state.  It's fucking ridiculous.  I mean, you know, I don't know how he expects, you know, people to live.  My wife's on unemployment, right?  She got $6,000 in so many months, and it raised my fucking income tax another $2,000.  Look at these sympathetic people.  One guy goes, hmm, a divorced cop? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, pension money, I don't understand how they just rape that, too.  They take it.  I know, it's ridiculous.  Well, you know, this state taxes up New York State, a New York City pension, anything.  So I'm fucked with the state.  But then with the federal government, I mean, I used to make a lot of money up north.  You know, I used to do a lot of overtime, moonlighting and stuff, and I always got a refund.  Now I make nothing, and I'm paying you bastards. 
[00:39:00]  It's fucked up.  I know how you guys feel.  I know you're getting fucked, Anthony.  Yeah, right in the eighth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No sympathy, though.  You know, even when they get Obama out, it's never going to change.  That's where my head is at.  I think the system is baroque.  I don't know what you do.  I don't know what you do.  I mean, I pay more taxes, and it sucks, but it's not hurting me.  But it still hurts when someone is taking more money out of your back pocket.  But I'm from a big family, a lot of cousins, too, and I see what is going on out there. 
[00:39:30]  They're fucking hurting, man.  You know why I know they're hurting?  Because my phone is ringing more.  That's the other side of being lucky enough to have a nice job and make a lot of money.  Boy, you get a lot of people calling your phone.  Yep.  Surprise, your phone's ringing more.  You have AT&T.  Yeah.  I get a lot of people calling my phone.  Mike, hold on.  The other thing I want to do with you here, everyone talks about how they're going to retire and go to North Carolina. 
[00:40:00]  North Carolina seems to be the go-to state.  Not Florida so much.  Florida for the old people, obviously.  But people that are just disappointed where they're living, they all talk about, oh, let's just move to North Carolina.  Yeah.  What is it about North Carolina?  Cheaper cost of living.  I'll tell you what.  Before I retired, I had to go to retirement seminars.  Yeah.  And they had a list of states to retire to and a list of states not to retire to.  And this is the fucking first state not to retire to, North Carolina. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, but if you want to continue working.  They got the highest taxes in the South.  They tax the pension.  They gas.  I'm paying the same price of gas as you're paying.  Everything.  The only thing is I could smoke for a dollar fucking less and kill myself a little bit.  That's all.  Wonderful.  Mike, hang in there, man.  All right, man.  At least you got this great radio show to escape to.  Yes!  I'll tell you what.  I'm coming home from work now because I worked the night, and this is my only bright spot 
[00:41:00]  at all in the day.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Please don't go home and kill yourself.  Hang in there.  All right, Mike.  There goes Mike.  A lot of phones.  You know, we can take a break.  We'll go back to the phones.  We got the State of the Union address.  Yes.  We got some clips.  Stalker Patty.  Remember when we were playing that TikTok song by Keisha?  Yes.  Or Kesha, whatever the hell her name is.  People brought up the fact that she almost sounded a little like Stalker Patty at the beginning  of the song.  Stalker Patty came in, sang the song. 
[00:41:30]  It's auto-tuned, and Sam gives it a big thumbs up.  Big thumbs up.  And he's got big thumbs.  He certainly does.  I saw her that day where she recorded it, or started recording it.  I was leaving, and she was coming in.  I was like, what are you doing here?  And she's like, I've got to record a song.  Like a big star.  That was the day Emeril Lagasse was out there.  And I go, go say hi to Emeril Lagasse.  I was trying to get it.  She's like, no, I don't know him.  I go, he's a celebrity.  Obviously, he was in a discussion with somebody, and she's like, he's talking with someone. 
[00:42:00]  I go, that's just another fan.  Go up to him.  Go up to him.  So she starts walking up to him, and then realizes that they're having a discussion and  turned away.  I was like, fuck you.  God damn it.  That would have been great.  Just interrupt.  Hi Emeril.  Bam.  Bam.  And for the guys down the hall, I know we're trying to move on from this Nick Cannon, who's  working at our old station that changed formats.  You know, Mariah Carey's wife.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  And I meant to say it that way, yes.  He is doing a bit right now, if you want to get involved.  What?  Called, what's your favorite cereal?  No.  Look, look, look.  Bundy.  What's your favorite cereal?  That is, you're kidding, not real.  Not kidding.  Not real.  Is that what the talent coach told him to do? 
[00:43:00]  It's Tina Marie.  Her Twitter name sucks.  Has upper management over there been fired at all, or is it just the talent again?  No.  Are you kidding?  No, they thought Nick Cannon would now get the job done.  Great.  This will be another just disaster for those guys.  What's your favorite cereal?  All right.  Let me think about that.  What kind of a whore radio agent would pass that off as really a good choice?  Instead of fighting for his other guys.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's your favorite cereal? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, he's fighting his own teeth.  How do you do that?  Could you please do a headstand so we can put Froot Loops in you and eat from it?  Of course.  And he's doing, what's your favorite cereal?  We would do a Froot Loop volcano or something.  Of course.  Yeah.  Can you picture, can you picture Howard's agent, can you picture Howard, like after Clear Channel  took him off those markets, can you picture his fucking agent actually taking care of  the people they replaced him with? 
[00:44:00]  No.  No.  That's what happened.  It happened here, it happened in Philly.  It's everywhere.  Nick Cannon is the, yeah, officially, I guess Nick Cannon took over for us.  They went without a morning show for, I don't know, nine months or something like that.  Ten months.  And yeah, he's-  Grand success.  And he is the guy in our spot, sitting in our actual seats, because he sits in all our  seats, he just rotates.  And our agent was the one who got on the gig, you're right.  Continued failure.  You're right.  Yeah.  You're right.  And I just can't picture Buckwall doing that, if he was taking off those markets in 
[00:44:30]  Clear Channel or somewhere else, and then just helping to replace him.  I just can't picture that happening.  No, we just get stepped on by everybody.  Everybody.  We're a doormat, for Christ's sake.  We should all have welcome written on us.  Yes.  But if the boys could get a little Nick Cannon doing, what's your favorite cereal?  I gotta hear that.  Number one market in the country.  Number one market.  Paying this guy, I've heard at least seven figures.  Yeah, it's gotta be here.  Well, it is seven figures, but I don't know how high. 
[00:45:00]  With a decimal point.  Yeah, I don't know how high in the seven figures it goes.  You can tell by the Bob graph.  We call it the Bob graph.  Yeah.  How much time he spends with a certain person is how much money they're making.  Sure.  So, obviously, by studying the bar graph of the Bob graph, I see that he's making a lot  of money.  Right.  Sam's running down the hall.  Oh, my God, is he?  Oh, I love this.  Look at his feet.  Oh.  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.  I'm Sam.  Quack, quack, quack. 
[00:45:30]  You're a brown noser.  You got funny feet.  Why are you wearing a serious hoodie?  Yeah, what is that about?  How much I charge you for?  It's a company I work for.  Oh, yeah.  I got big news, though.  What?  The results are in.  He really is doing the cereal thing?  I didn't hear the actual whole bit.  But the results are in?  The results are in.  Don't tell me.  Tell us after the break.  This is a good teaser.  Cliffhanger.  I got first and second place.  Let's have a cliffhanger.  And that will be after the break. 
[00:46:00]  After the break, we're going to find out what New York's favorite cereals are.  Yeah.  Jesus.  What cereals wake you up in the morning when you're rolling with Nick Cannon?  Why?  Rolling?  Yeah.  Isn't he trying to get street cred?  That's why he's rolling.  Not rolling.  Rolling.  Rolling, yeah.  With apostrophe.  G's aren't very, um, you don't got street cred when you put G's in things.  Unless you're a G, which is ironic.  Now that I've... 
[00:46:30]  Oh, G.  Now that I've been in this business, I don't know, like 25 years now.  Holy shit.  Started as a little kid.  I'm the Doogie Howser radio.  Yeah.  How long have I been alive?  I officially give up trying to figure out what this radio thing's all about.  Finally, it's happened.  It's happened.  I can't be bothered trying to figure it out anymore.  No.  Now, this fucking company we used to work for puts Nick Cannon in.  He's never done radio.  He's, uh, he's the wife of Mariah Carey.  Uh, and I got some inside info, uh, uh, last night from somebody that is in the know, and 
[00:47:00]  this is legit.  You!  Should I throw this out there?  Please.  Some people will care, and most people will be like, whatever.  Please do, because it just tells.  It tells.  It's so telling.  Nick Cannon is in his second week of radio.  He's never done radio before, and that just doesn't work.  Because this radio thing, believe it or not, is pretty fucking hard and stressful.  Yeah.  Uh, after, actually a week and a half, they decided that Nick Cannon needs a talent coach.  Yes.  They brought in a, not a consultant, they brought in a guy, a high-powered guy, supposedly out 
[00:47:30]  of L.A., to teach, teach Nick Cannon how to do radio.  To have talent.  To have talent.  You have to teach him to have talent.  He actually has a talent coach, because they realized quickly, like, holy shit, this guy  doesn't know what he's fucking doing.  Uh-oh.  Which is no surprise, because CBS has done this many times before this.  Oh, please.  They, boy, do they repeat mistakes.  They just over and over again.  What terrible incompetence.  That's fucking embarrassing. 
[00:48:00]  And they all still just sit there.  They never.  In their ivory towers.  They never lopped their own heads off.  No.  Never.  So.  Nope.  Nick Cannon has a talent coach now.  Do you think the cereal thing was the talent coach's idea?  Oh, I'm sure.  He said the phones are just shut down.  So.  He had a bunch of facts I was listening.  We want to talk about cereal.  Oh, please.  They're not shut down.  Well, they might be, because Steve from Banjo is coming up with a couple of cereal suggestions  that I can't repeat on these airwaves.  Why?  You didn't write it. 
[00:48:30]  I am not going to repeat it.  I wish they would just let him do his show.  Well, you'll have the results, and maybe, just maybe, just a little audio, just a couple  snippet.  It has to be quick, though.  You can't take long Nick Cannon today?  No, when we were playing the Nick Cannon audio last week, I realized we were in over  our head.  Like, we can't make anything out of this.  And then we're just sitting here, stuck looking at each other, listening to Nick Cannon.  But, Opie.  We can't even goof on this.  We don't even, we didn't have an angle on it.  But, Opie, he didn't have a topic. 
[00:49:00]  He was just riffing with the music and welcoming New York to his new show.  So, now, we have what's your favorite cereal.  Yeah.  I guess the number is, thank you, Tina Marie, first wreck.  I mean, if you want credit for your Twitter, you've got to come up with better names.  But, she goes, you can call him at 888-923-0923.  Ask him how it is to be married to Mariah Carey.  Yeah.  How it is to be a wife to Mariah Carey. 
[00:49:30]  It's probably crazy, because Mariah did prank call his show.  Oh, yeah.  Do you have that audio?  Not yet, because I've been recording the live show.  You've got to get that.  And he knew it was his wife.  No.  I mean, husband.  Within, what, seconds, right?  No, it was a prank.  So, she got him.  She got him?  Yeah.  Please get that.  All right.  We've got lots to do after the break.  Do you want to hear a Lawyer Ron call going into break? 
[00:50:00]  You bet I do.  Do we even have to set this up?  No.  All right.  We don't.  This guy is going to be a star on our show.  Lawyer Ron talking to the callers yesterday.  Here's one of the calls.  Yeah, that sounds like Ron the lawyer a little bit, right?  Sergeant Holcomb?  Yeah.  Sergeant Holcomb.  Who's stripes?  John Candy was in that movie.  He didn't have a big role, though, I don't think.  I don't really remember John Candy's lines from Stripes.  He would have awful lines like he would walk on the train and go,  Hey, is there a movie on this flight?  Yeah.  Movie on this flight. 
[00:50:30]  Fucking love John Candy.  And there was the best lines after he was all covered with mud.  Yeah.  And John Larrakat's like, what happened?  He's like, well, sir, we're on our way to Fingo Parlor.  All right.  And John Larrakat goes, shut up.  He goes, okay, sir.  Okay.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  Opie and Anthony, we got State of the Union audio.  We got more of your phone calls.  A lot of people bitching and complaining.  I don't blame them.  Just getting fucked.  Tax season is slowly approaching. 
[00:51:00]  Also, let's not forget about the Groundhog thing.  We got to talk about that as well.  Peter's getting involved.  Yeah, they're not very excited about Puck's tawny fill.  After all these years, they want them.  Well, I guess we could do it because it's quick.  They want them to use what?  A robot?  A robotic.  A robotic groundhog?  You know, look.  Yeah.  Ah!  Ah!  Yeah.  Um, Groundhogs.  Come on.  Gives a shit about Groundhogs.  They want to fucking use a robot groundhog because they think Punxsutawney Phil is being abused 
[00:51:30]  with the lights and the people and it frightens him.  Meanwhile, they're saying he's one of the most pampered little fuckers out there.  But, uh, yeah.  They want to get a little robot.  Look, if you're a pain-in-the-ass animal, you shouldn't get sympathy from Peter.  Mm-hmm.  You can't save all the animals, but the pain-in-the-ass ones just fucking...  Who gives a shit about them?  I can't see...  Do you know what a groundhog could do to a golf course? 
[00:52:00]  I can't see that whole thing.  It's like...  And now here's, uh...  Let's bring out Punxsutawney Phil.  There he is.  Thank you.  No, no, no.  This isn't the one we used to play on, man.  Oh, my God.  No, he's a...  He's a robot.  Oh, my God.  There's lasers shooting out of his eyes.  That's okay.  I'm on Kenny Loggins.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I actually agree with Peter on this.  No, you don't. 
[00:52:30]  Not for the same reasons.  Why?  Because he is pampered.  Because I fucking hate...  I know he does.  Punxsutawney Phil.  Punxsutawney Phil's a cunt.  Every time I hear Jimmy talking about how much he hates Punxsutawney Phil, I go, wow,  another year's gone by.  Yeah.  It's, like, amazing.  When is this groundhog thing?  Soon?  Yeah, for a couple weeks.  I hate these guys.  They're stupid fucking hats.  It's just stupid.  You know, there's another groundhog out there that doesn't get the attention that this,  uh, Punxsutawney Phil gets. 
[00:53:00]  Punxsutawney.  A little, uh, groundhog named Ted.  Ted the groundhog.  I don't have a...  No, they're...  Really, Ted the groundhog.  Yeah.  Where's he?  He's in, like, just some real small fucking shithole.  He's in Schenectady.  He's in Schenectady.  Poor Ted's got Schenectady every year.  I'm frightened, but not of my shadow, of all the people.  Somebody called Ingrid Newkirk. 
[00:53:30]  Poor Ted, you don't want them using a robot, right?  I certainly do, Gregory.  You do.  I want to go back to the woods and hibernate and lick my own testicles.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  But it's tradition, Ted.  I want to do things the groundhogs do, which is eat apples and fruits of that ilk.  Do they do that?  I don't even know.  Yes, we do, Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  Do you ruin golf courses, Ted?  Groundhogs, man.  I do.  Our hero is the guy from Caddyshack. 
[00:54:00]  That little guy really got things going.  I was actually going to phrase that funnier.  Ha, ha, ha.  We knew where you were going.  I'm not used to being an animal.  I believe that was a robotic, uh, golfer.  And not even a groundhog.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I think there's a difference between the two fucking varmints.  They're giant rats.  All of them.  They're in the rat family, right?  All of them are rodents.  They're disgusting.  Didn't one, like, didn't one, uh, uh, bite Bloomberg last year or something? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  The one that they do on Staten Island?  Yeah.  Like, everyone has their own version, and it just pales in comparison to the wonderfulness  of Pawnee Phil.  But you would assume that the mayor's used to getting a little bite every once in a while.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Keep that one between us.  There is actually another one.  Oh, there is another, what, groundhog?  Yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's Puxatawney chip.  Oh, no.  No, there's not.  Let's, let's replace that one with a robot and then pull his batteries out. 
[00:55:00]  See, but he's out there clapping and stuff.  I guess I should come out and maybe see a shadow or something.  Good one.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Um, Sam insists.  Sam.  That we play this Nick Cannon clip.  Yeah.  Even though we have so much that we want to get to, he goes, you've got to go right to  the Nick Cannon clip.  I guess it was brought to my attention on Twitter that, uh, Nick Cannon's doing, what's your 
[00:55:30]  favorite cereal?  What's your favorite cereal?  And we got, we got the conclusion of it.  Now, that's the cutting edge kind of radio that they are looking for over there at our  old station.  Right.  Now, we used to work there.  Obviously, uh, Nick Cannon's there now, who's, uh, uh, married to a Mariah Carey, uh, represented  by, uh, our own agent, uh, which is wonderful.  Yeah.  And, um, uh, he's doing the type of radio that, Opie, we just couldn't pull off.  Hell fucking no.  I guess we just couldn't pull it off.  But what's your favorite cereal? 
[00:56:00]  Now we're talking, I just see ratings.  What do you think?  I see them.  What do you think was the, the one cereal where he went, whoa, hey, well, slow down a little  bit now.  Oh, let me think.  Something had to be like.  Count chocolate?  Frankenberry, yeah, see?  Something odd like that.  Or how about, um, uh, Star Wars C-3PO's?  Whoa.  What?  Is that brought up?  No, that's it.  I'm just saying that's so obscure.  Fruit, fruit.  Yes.  Fruit, fruit. 
[00:56:30]  You gotta eat fruit, fruit.  That's when, uh, that's when someone's calling saying some bitch OD'd and you're bringing  her over the house, you're eating fruit, fruit.  Uh, so what do we got here?  Well, this is the climactic conclusion of the what's your favorite cereal bit, which he  must have spent his first hour on.  Hmm.  And?  He spent, yeah, the first hour, the topic for the 6 a.m. hour.  And, and, uh, and, do you, well. 
[00:57:00]  What's wrong?  The talent coach.  Yeah?  Well, what did he get this from the talent coach?  This bid idea.  He seems to, because he's really, he's trying to do some radio here.  He get, he announced his first, second, and third place, and then he goes to a caller.  Does he make it sound so exciting, like the whole world needs to know?  It's like, uh, he just has so much energy about cereal.  Fruit Loops!  Oh, come on, man!  Oh, shit!  Fruit Loops!  Fruit Loops!  Is it Fruit Loops?  Is it Fruit Loops?  It's gotta be like that. 
[00:57:30]  This is not, I'm doing this spoiler free until the clip comes out.  Oh, please, don't spoil this.  Look, we'll be the first to admit we gotta pump some shit up when you do radio, but some  of these guys are just ridiculous, getting excited about a cereal bit.  Well, the canon is excitable.  Alright, let's listen to this.  The new 92.3 now, rolling with Nick Cannon.  The polls are closed.  It's officially in.  Fruit Loops tops it off.  The number one.  That was an absolute guess on my part. 
[00:58:00]  Way to go, Jimmy.  So, give it up for Fruit Loops.  Fruit Loops, everybody.  How would you think that was an example?  Fruit Loops.  It's the number one of all the listeners.  Yeah.  They prefer Fruit Loops to other cereals.  Oh.  I, um, I don't know.  I think he's a little biased there, because didn't his wife go Fruit Loops for a little  while there, a few years back?  I'm sure he would not appreciate that remark.  Well, that's what I heard.  Why didn't he like Cocoa Puffs?  Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.  No.  That's another crazy Mariah Carey joke. 
[00:58:30]  Yes, it is.  Trying to think about the crazy ones.  I'll give it a minute or two.  We'll have some on the phones, I'm sure.  Sugar-frosted huge tits?  No, it's not a cereal.  Tony the, oh, no, no, it's Tiger.  Oh, wow.  Jimmy.  I'm not going to like this.  Jimmy.  Oh, this is terrible.  The number one cereal to wake you up in the morning.  Coming in second, Lucky Charms, Frosted Flakes was third.  And, uh, we got one more call. 
[00:59:00]  Let's go to the phone.  Ebony from Brooklyn, what's your favorite cereal?  My favorite cereal is Lucky Charms.  Cereal.  That's what, see, Ebony, now we on the same page.  Ain't they magically delicious?  What?  Is they magically?  Oh, the milk, Nick.  After?  The milk?  The milk?  And, like, you be chasing that one little marshmallow around with your spoon, and it  be swimming all through the milk.  I can't.  That is enjoyment.  I can't.  What's wrong?  I'm tapping out.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That this is radio. 
[00:59:30]  Why?  That's great, because you always want to give away number one first.  What's my favorite cereal?  Oh my God, I got it there!  Cereal.  Cereal.  It's called Cereal.  It's Ebony in Brooklyn.  And her favorite cereal is Lucky Charms, because you chase around that fucking little marshmallow.  She likes the milk, though.  Well, yeah, of course she does.  What the fuck are you talking about?  What's your favorite cereal, Precious?  I like a bowl of Lucky Charms, and I eat the bowl, motherfuckers. 
[01:00:00]  Holy shit!  That...  Hold on, we got...  Look, I keep thinking we are playing the worst radio ever the previous time we played the  worst radio ever.  And as the listeners here enjoy this horrendous radio, it makes us really depressed.  Trust me.  Yeah, yeah.  Trust me.  You enjoy, we'll take the fucking depression.  Yeah, we get depressed, because...  Donkey Kong cereal.  This fucking old company of ours.  This is the show they're making another mistake. 
[01:00:30]  Danny can't get past the first spoonful of Donkey Kong cereal.  Ah, inside joke.  Inside joke.  Danny sucked at Donkey Kong cereal.  It's the third spoonful.  Yeah, it's the third spoonful.  Billy Mitchell ate the whole box.  Yes, he did.  And he did.  Yeah.  Honestly, Count Chocula fucking rules.  I count chocolate, I like a lot.  Did you like it?  Who doesn't?  Me.  Come on.  I hate milk is the problem.  What?  I'm not like fucking, what's the name there?  Are we going to do the bit now?  Yes.  What's up with you guys?  We'll do it better, though.  No, I'm saying I don't like milk, period, so I don't fucking like it. 
[01:01:00]  I like cookie crisp.  I would love some cookie crisp, but it's too fattening for me.  It is.  It's a treat.  So I have a child.  You're a fucking child.  You haven't lived until you've taken milk from a tit.  What?  What?  Oh, what?  Oh, what?  What happened?  Didn't somebody do that one day?  We had cereal and tit milk.  No, we did breast milk ice cream.  I ate breast milk ice cream.  Because I'm a shock jock.  I've been shocking that day.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:01:30]  It tastes exactly like ice cream, but the aftertaste was fucking horrendous.  Yeah.  It tasted like, I think Danny tasted it, too.  It tasted like sweaty armpit.  It went from delicious ice cream to sweaty armpit within a second.  Yeah, it got sour pretty quick.  Whose milk was it again?  That was Pat Duffy's sister.  Yeah, Pat Duffy's sister.  Look at Jimmy.  That's the bit you do.  Breast milk has a very bitter aftertaste.  Holy shit, does it, Sam?  I guess it has to be pasteurized. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, I think so.  Let's say hi to Dave in Connecticut.  Dave?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  I was wondering if Nick Cannon had a big bowl of a-boo-berries.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  I'm surprised Lucky Charles didn't win.  They see that leprechaun.  They go, give me the gold.  I want the gold.  Give me the gold.  Have we played that in a while?  I always say we're good friends, right?  Yeah, I know.  I remember the good friends discussion.  I got thrown under the bus for like a half hour. 
[01:02:30]  That was horrendous.  I don't eat good friends anymore.  Good friends.  I don't.  I really don't.  You're showing all different races of people.  Why does it have to go back to me?  Cover their fucking Kashi good friends cereal.  Can we keep it with beating up Nick Cannon?  Why does it have to go back to me?  It's good friends, horrible family members cereal.  Look, I'm a fan of the Kashi shit.  Are you?  But the good friends is horrendous. 
[01:03:00]  Are you voting?  Oh, no, no.  We're doing the bit again.  Let's say hi.  Well, how come every time we listen to horrible radio, we always wind up doing the bits?  They're good bits.  Are they?  Yeah.  Are they?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Akiva.  We're assholes.  Akiva.  Yeah, what up?  I think maybe Nick Cannon's having himself a nice bowl of chock full of nuts.  Oh.  Oh.  That's right.  Oh.  Chock full of nuts?  Is that an actual...  That's the coffee.  Coffee.  That's, yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  You should have said nut clusters.  What's wrong with the cereals we got?  They eat pretty good.  Cereal.  What's some of those cereals?  Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  Cap'n Crunch.  Wheat.  Mini.  Mini.  Medicine Mini.  And I got mixed up with Wheat Tins, so it came out with meat.  Yes, those are great.  Wheat Tins cereal are delicious.  For the lady with a glass eye.  Wow. 
[01:04:00]  Going back.  Sandy Duncan with whore Wheat Thins.  She would.  She'd only see half of them.  Let's get back to this terrific phone call he took.  That is enjoyment.  Oh, God.  Nick, I just want to say thank you for letting me talk to you.  So, um, my bus driver, I'm going to make sure any of me and my bus driver, we both like  Chuck Lucky Charms.  That's what's up.  And we love you in all your movies.  I love, oh, while it out, oh, my God, it needs to come back on TV.  That is my show.  I got you. 
[01:04:30]  As a matter of fact, you know what, Ebony, me, you, and your bus driver need to share  a bowl of Lucky Charms.  Magically Delicious.  Magically Delicious.  One more thing.  I love you, Chris Brown.  Forget the haters.  Have a good day, Nick.  Have a good day.  Magically Delicious.  We heard you.  That's a good song.  Hit the post.  Magically Delicious.  Ebony likes Chris Brown.  Yeah.  Me, my bus driver.  She likes a nice fucking punch to the face, I guess, huh?  I was on here with my bus driver. 
[01:05:00]  He said Lucky Charms too.  My crack dealer said Lucky Charms.  And I love the motherfucker Lucky Charms.  Even a fat, retarded white girl.  Yeah, it's on the bus hill.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  Whose ass is that?  Wow, that's Lindsay Lohan's.  What is she doing?  Being naked in magazines, apparently.  Does she have duty?  That's all she does now.  It looks like she's got a piece of duty sticking out.  Is she turtling?  What is that?  Let me see.  I think she's turtling in that pic.  Oh, good.  A better close-up.  Oh, does she have a cigarette in her hand?  Oh, she's really dark and mysterious. 
[01:05:30]  Whoa.  Why is she doing this?  She's in fishnets.  No undies, it looks like.  Because she can't get any movie roles, because she's a fucking loser.  So now she just gets naked or partially naked in magazines.  Is that the most naked shot there is?  Huh?  Hang on.  There might be another one.  Hey, what's that tip?  Oh, let's see the tip picture.  The last one.  She's got a cigarette by the toilet.  She's going to take your shit.  She's got a cigarette.  Puffing on a butt.  Look at that shit, yo.  Hiding the nipples, of course.  No, no.  You can kind of see that nipple.  Look at that shit. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, the new thing is to show it a little bit.  All right.  She's got some nice tits.  Yeah, she's all right.  That dumb word again, tits.  Can't stand her.  Dumb face.  Yeah, not a fan.  Let's go ahead.  Oh, she's a wild one.  Look out.  We met her before.  Like, she went, like, nuts.  Nah, she was still crazy when she came in over at XM.  You think?  Yeah, she was.  She was already starting that party.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  All right.  She wasn't crazy in Freaky Friday.  Right after that, she just lost her mind.  Okay, she was nine.  She's perfect for you. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  She's perfect for you.  Stop.  You wouldn't.  She's perfect for you.  Come on.  She is, like, get you in a lot of trouble crazy.  That is a get you in a lot of trouble crazy girl.  When you're out, you'd be getting in fights and just drug charges.  And just having to take the fall for her.  She's driving away.  You're there getting cuffed.  Go, what happened?  Fuck that.  Have you ever dated one of those?  No, not that crazy. 
[01:07:00]  Well.  I haven't gotten that crazy.  Or I haven't let it escalate to that crazyness.  Where it all starts off nice with maybe a little dinner date.  And by the end of the weekend, you're in jail.  You're in jail.  Going, what the fuck happened?  She's in the hospital.  Yeah.  And not because of you.  She's going into rehab.  She's ODing.  Yeah.  You're taking the fall.  I never had that John Travolta drive to Lance's house.  Right on.  You ever have the John Travolta kiss on the step of a plane?  Well, enough said. 
[01:07:30]  I'm not bringing that up.  You see the video of him?  His kiss on the plane is great.  You see the video of him bringing supplies to Haiti on his own goddamn plane?  His own plane.  Yeah.  He was affected by that thing.  Was he?  He's affected by everything now since the passing of his son.  He's very sensitive now.  Did you notice he hit the post on a pre-  I love that we educated the listeners to how horrendous radio is.  And now they pay.  Yeah.  I get emails and tweets all the time where people now, like, they enjoy listening for all the hack shit that we point out. 
[01:08:00]  Sean in Albany.  Sean.  Hey.  I wasn't pointing that out.  Someone in studio pointed out that he hit the post on a pre-recorded phone call.  Yeah.  Pre-recorded phone call and he hits the post.  Oh, yeah.  Because you do a little math.  You're like, okay, the intro on this is 15 seconds.  So 15 seconds left in the phone call.  I'm going to start that record and it's going to match up nice.  No, you're thinking too much.  Nick Cannon's not saying, I'm going to do that.  Nick Cannon sits with nothing in front of him and just talks. 
[01:08:30]  He's got a staff to do that for him.  And a talent coach.  And a talent coach.  I'm bored up.  You need a talent coach to do radio, man.  You're in the wrong fucking business.  We have nothing.  Our problem is we never listen to one fucking person in all these years.  That's not a one.  Best problems ever.  Almost listen to Eric Logan.  Almost.  Maybe we should bring a talent coach in here.  Hell fucking no.  All right.  We should just to ridicule him.  Dude, do you know how much fun that would be if we had a talent coach come in and then all 
[01:09:00]  of his awful suggestions we incorporated and then ridiculed them?  Dude, that's exactly what we should do.  Get a talent coach for a fucking couple days.  All right.  Well, let's not talk about it on the air.  You're right.  I'm stupid.  Less than one of the talent coach.  Keep it under your hat.  Right.  Let's keep the bit under our hat.  Let them forget we ever said it and then, you know.  Then we're in.  Yeah, exactly.  You want some Obama in?  Obama.  I don't know.  Michelle Obama looked like she was pissed off last night during that address. 
[01:09:30]  And this is different from what day?  She had a few looks toward the president there.  I think the president mentioned that she's.  What the fuck was the one thing?  Oh, shit.  He did not.  What?  Oh, oh, oh, wow.  I thought, oh, that he mentioned.  Okay.  Sure he knows.  Yes, Ken.  All right.  You mean when he gave her kudos for doing, like, taking care of fat kids?  That's what it was.  Taking care of fat kids.  Yeah, and she looked at him like.  What the fuck?  No, that's really what happened.  Yeah, she got a.  She gave him a look like. 
[01:10:00]  I'm doing a little more than that, sir.  Yeah, she got a standing ovation.  Then she's talking about us.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  It's not about me.  Even though she wants it to be about her.  And then the president, you know, off the cuff goes.  Ah, she gets embarrassed.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Off the cuff.  Yeah.  All right.  What a guy.  Well, let's go to Obama setting the record straight on the financial situation.  I'm not going to play all these clubs.  We'll play a couple now, and then we'll play a little later.  We'll mix this shit up a little bit.  So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, Jimmy's standing up clapping already.  I'm still ready.  Pelosi.  At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over  $200 billion.  All right.  By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits  of $8 trillion over the next decade. 
[01:11:00]  And I will raise that even more.  Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription  drug program.  On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget.  He is not taking responsibility.  All this was before I walked in the door.  Shut the fuck up.  Now. 
[01:11:30]  Now.  Just stating the facts.  Oh, the facts.  As you see them.  Shut up.  Every president has to inherit the other president's shit.  What he's done is increase that deficit.  How about you talk about that?  How much money you're fucking bleeding more than Bush left?  I understand Bush chalked up a fuck of a deficit after Clinton had a surplus. 
[01:12:00]  By the way, under Clinton's surplus, our intelligence was gone.  The fucking military was decimated.  And 9-11 was a direct result of that.  9-11 then cost a lot of fucking money, regardless of the wars.  Regardless of the two wars.  Cost a lot of money to just get our intelligence back up.  Have that shit running.  Have a military that's stronger and can deal with situations like 9-11.  And to keep that from happening again.  Which, by the way, it didn't.  That cost a lot of fucking money. 
[01:12:30]  And this motherfucker is complaining still that Bush chalked up a huge deficit.  And what is he doing to cut that deficit?  Oh, that's right.  He's not.  He's taking more money.  Printing up more money.  Taking out more loans from fucking China.  Shut up already.  Stay to the blame, Bush.  Stay to the blame, Bush address.  Very good.  With Pelosi's fucking goddamn dry ice steam coming out of her pussy. 
[01:13:00]  That fucking frigid cunt.  Yuck.  What do you do for a living, character?  Greatest quote ever.  What do you do for a living, character?  Character?  The way he says character.  Character's the best.  I want him to actually just call me and say that all the time.  Call me character.  You know when Steve calls when we have to talk about medical shit?  We're going to have Ron the lawyer call when we have to talk about lawyers.  Absolutely. 
[01:13:30]  So it's going to be, he's going to be great.  I thought you meant Steve, Steve.  Here's the second half of what Obama was saying last night.  If we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit.  But we took office amid a crisis.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  When are ordinary times, by the way?  What the fuck is that?  Little House on the Prairie?  When are ordinary times?  Presidents usually take office and there's some kind of fucking crisis. 
[01:14:00]  Reagan took office in the middle of the fucking Iran hostages and the cold fucking war.  Remember that thing that lasted a couple of years?  Every president had to deal with the fucking threat of nuclear fucking war.  Come on.  What do you do for a living, character?  Hi, hello, come on to the radio show.  LBJ had to get a limo with stuff all in the back?  Exactly.  I'm with you on that one.  There's never ordinary times.  Ordinary times? 
[01:14:30]  When was the last time we had ordinary times?  For real.  Could you think?  Back in history, the last time we had ordinary times.  Ordinary?  What does that even mean?  He threw a word out like ordinary times.  Basically where the country was running nice and there was no major issues.  When was the last time?  And let's not go for the joke right away.  I'm really trying to think.  When was the last time we had ordinary times?  1861.  1861.  That's why I said let's not go for the jokes right away. 
[01:15:00]  Although that's a great one.  Come on, Google it, Google it.  When?  When you go to the 50s?  When they talk about how nice it was?  Dude, the 50s was, Korea was in the 50s.  The Cold War was really gearing up.  Nuclear testing all over the place.  The 60s, we had the Cuban Missile Crisis.  We had the Vietnam War.  We had, again, nuclear missile talk.  Oh, 70s.  The 70s.  We had disco.  The 70s, huge recession, fuel crisis. 
[01:15:30]  That was the Ford thing?  Where he told Ford to drop dead?  Joe Ford told New York City to drop dead.  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, the 80s, again.  Cocaine.  And all this is Cold War.  All this is still Cold War shit like that.  So there was never ordinary times.  There's not ordinary times.  If you're the president, you're not going to be able to sit back and go,  Oh, this is great.  Yeah, I'm just going to fucking sit back because we're in ordinary times.  Let's go to Mac in Atlanta.  He's got a very good point here.  Mac? 
[01:16:00]  Hey, Opie, can you give me a favor?  Sure.  Take the haterade away from Anthony and get Woody on the phone, please.  Haterade?  I'm drinking my haterade.  And then another guy.  Stop whining at it.  You sound like Rush.  What?  I don't think so, sir.  Oh, and this did happen.  Just to bring back a little comedy.  John in Ohio.  John, this did happen.  Yes, John.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Yeah, last night, Fox News, I was watching the coverage of the speech,  at the beginning of the, before the speech started, they were panning the audience, 
[01:16:30]  and they said, and here's a look at the president's box, and there's Michelle Obama standing there  at the back of the camera.  It really did go down.  John is absolutely right.  All right.  Here's the president's box, and it was, you know, Michelle Obama in the presidential box, but...  Oh, that's fucking great.  Oopsie.  That's a good one.  And I'm talking truth or aid.  Truth or aid.  Yes.  Truth or aid.  Are you a truther?  Are you a truther? 
[01:17:00]  No, I'm just, I'm telling the truth.  That's right.  The truther aid.  That's right.  Our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national  debt.  That, too, is a fact.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do.  Yeah.  But families across the country are tightening their belts.  But?  And making tough decisions.  What?  The federal government should do the same.  Oh, really?  Really?  Really? 
[01:17:30]  By bribing senators to cast a yes vote on your health care bill?  Yeah, that's how you do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  God!  You annoys me!  What do you do for a living, Carriker?  Carriker?  I finally got a defense when you rant.  Every time you rant now.  What do you do for a living, Carriker?  Carriker is the best character I've ever heard.  Did they put more quotes on there? 
[01:18:00]  I hope there's more.  Carriker?  Not yet.  Oh, they got to get a whole bank of Ron quotes.  Yeah, we got to get a few more, Iraq.  So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took  to rescue the economy last year.  Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years.  Oh, that's after you get out, right?  Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be 
[01:18:30]  affected.  But all other discretionary government programs will.  Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and  sacrifice what we don't.  And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.  Who's veto?  Sounds like a tough guy.  That's pretty funny. 
[01:19:00]  Enforced by veto, hey.  Send out a big gavon.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Could have just as easily said enforced by Luca or somebody else in the Godfather movies.  That ship's too funny right there.  Actually kind of, you know, made sense.  No, it said in there, he just took a funny joke you took, made, and then just trampled  it with a boring fucking long-winded thing.  I just like telling you Chip's funny so you're annoyed.  I'm not annoyed.  I want Chip to be a hit. 
[01:19:30]  Chip is the proverbial hit.  Let's say hi to Barry in Virginia.  Barry.  Oh.  Buenos noches.  Ah.  What?  Great.  So, um, so this fucking blowhard cocksucker, um.  Come on, he's Anthony.  He's fucking just ranting.  I know.  I'm just, I'll give him my opinion.  High school education does not any longer guarantee a good-paying job.  All right, so all my fucking taxpayer money paying for fucking minorities and assholes  who couldn't graduate high school like myself. 
[01:20:00]  So that, if you do go to college for free, then absolutely you will have a good-paying  job.  I mean, there's no goddamn doubt.  And one other thing, you just made it, you just said, Anthony, you just said when he  gets out.  Yeah.  He says, five years of guarantee that the exports from America overseas will double.  That's it.  They're going to fucking double.  Because he said so?  Dude, I work in government contracting.  A simple fucking computer system for any agency around the Beltway takes fucking five 
[01:20:30]  years in and of itself.  And you're telling me that you're going to fucking double the exports, meaning we're going  to generate fucking two times as many goddamn textiles, crops, core, whatever the fuck  it is.  And all of a sudden, export it when your fucking black ass is gone.  Fucking break.  Full of shit.  What do you do for a living, character?  Just listen.  Listen to all that just to play the clip.  That's all it was about.  We didn't even listen to the guy.  We were just waiting for him to finish. 
[01:21:00]  They're having Blueberry Pancake Day on the local news, so.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  Sounds good.  Fox, locally here in New York, they have Blueberry Pancake Day.  The world has fallen apart, but they're having Blueberry Pancake Day yet.  Yeah.  I think that's what we need to do.  Oh, God, that Obama.  Whatever.  Yeah, by the way, that's true.  The spending freeze is less than 1% of the deficit.  It's really going to do nothing.  I'm glad he didn't spend a lot of time on health care. 
[01:21:30]  Why not?  That's one of his passions.  Why didn't he spend a lot of time?  Hmm, let's try to think.  Oh, because America completely rejected it and is looking at it as a boondoggle?  What's a boondoggle?  I don't know.  It's one of those things that just get caught up and it costs a lot of money or something.  Is that the definition of a boondoggle?  Yeah, I call it something else at home.  Oh, I know.  Say.  Say.  Yeah, say.  Say.  Right.  Hey, let's say hi to Jamie in Maryland.  Jamie.  Yeah, I was going to say Obama can say it only once, but honestly, the truth of the matter 
[01:22:00]  is that yesterday, more people are interested in Steve Jobs' State of the Union address  than Obama.  Yeah, I think you got a point there.  That's where our country's at.  I think you're absolutely right.  People are Googling the fucking iPad way more than the State of the Union address.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  I want to get the bigger one, the MaxiPad.  Google it. 
[01:22:30]  Wait.  It becomes funnier then.  Right about here.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  yes that is a fucking rooster that um that will be in the hall of fame sure of bombs 
[01:23:00]  state of the union uh more audio later on in the program why don't we take a break because after  the break we got uh stalker patty performing tiktok by by kesha or keisha i think it might  be kesha now that i think about it right yeah but uh we're gonna go to break with our new favorite  person uh ron the lawyer taking phone calls yesterday uh oh this is a part one part two

[01:26:00]  symbolizes anthony's problems right with addictive behavior shut it because he unwraps something but  that he can't contain it and put it back in his little package either that or he really doesn't  like wrapping noises they're probably down the hall going good idea top-notch idea i dreamed uh that  you die and um after a few years yeah a bunch of years no one even knows you ever walked this  planet that ain't quite a dream that won't be right the fuck up reality that won't be right the

[01:28:00]  sure of their court date right now but this is a developing story this morning out of kenton county  it's not a developing story it is what it is it's a quick little the guy was drunk in public he'll get  a fucking little fine thing and i don't understand that public intoxication there should be another  crime like it shouldn't just be you're drunk it should be all right you you're drunk and you were  um fucking uh assaulting somebody or being um a disturbance or something just being drunk in 
[01:28:30]  public it doesn't seem like much of a crime to me it's legal to drink uh they sell the shit so it  makes you drunk people seem to know that what was not driving what was he doing that they said holy  shit that guy's just that's what it's like that's what it should come down to you're right that should  be the crime just the act of being drunk outside is kind of fun and if you're a fun person then what's  the problem i say oh he was blowing a dog's oh okay blowing dogs if you should you blow a stray dogs

[01:29:30]  that's there now that's fucking there that's a that's a laughable one that's an easy one laughable  or not you just don't want it you just don't want that there just in case you know you want to  do something that uh entails having a completely clean record well stinkfist writes from florida  who with a lot of o's gives a fuck we're a trillion dollars in debt oh that doesn't mean anything and  by the way uh a correction somebody actually googled it obama is the number one google and number two

That's a good ending  Funny  That's fucked up, man  That just goes to show you  That's fucked up  I mean, Stalker Patty could sing  We've all heard her sing  She's sung some stuff for us 
[01:45:00]  And Ron and Fez  And yeah, whatever  But especially when the music kicks in  And then you get to really produce around  The voice and the music  It's just like, alright  If that was playing on the radio  I would just go like  Oh, here's another one of these  It's another pop song  Yeah, it's another pop song  Someone wants us to put the songs  Back to back or whatever  Can you try that and see if it works at all?  Yeah, we can do something  I think her version  Crossfader?  I think her version is slightly slower, right?  Patty's?  Yeah  Well, she lost her timing at points  So we had to 
[01:45:30]  Maybe do a mix of the two songs and see  Yeah, like halfway through the verse  Fade into Kesha or whatever  Yeah, just fuck around  See if it works  If it doesn't, no worries  Yeah  Isn't that amazing, though?  Song of Patty  Patty could have the number one song in America  Oh, she could  But she's a 53-year-old virgin retard  Right  That's not sexy  That doesn't work  You gotta find a hot broad  Then you make her into a Kesha  Right  Kesha should be embarrassed  Why?  We did that in  Not we, but Troy 
[01:46:00]  Yeah  You guys did it in an hour  Great job, by the way  We made a pop star within an hour  Yeah  Patty's name would be Blecha  Good job to Troy and the rest of the gang on that one  Did you notice the Kenny cameo in the beginning?  That was him who said, what up, girl  P. Diddy's part  Oh, really?  Yeah  What up, girl?  Fucking Kenny  Okay  That's fantastic  Well, good for Patty 
[01:46:30]  She's got a hit song  She's got it  Yeah  Alright, Paul Shirley  Let's talk about Paul Shirley for a minute or two here  I am serious  Don't call me Paul Shirley  Paul Shirley  I guess he's an ex-NBA guy  I don't really remember him playing  Is he still playing or no?  I don't even remember him  They said he wasn't very famous  But I think he played for the Bulls and maybe the Suns 
[01:47:00]  But he was done now?  He's done now, yeah  And he's an analyst?  Yeah, he blogs for ESPN  And now he doesn't anymore, right?  I wouldn't think so  I think he gets suspended or fired or something  Well, this is what Paul Shirley had to say about Haiti  If you haven't heard of this yet, it's pretty outrageous  Had you ever heard of Paul Shirley?  The best ball player?  No  Most people have not heard of this guy  And they're probably going to wish they hadn't after you hear about this story  Oh, right  Shut up  Why? 
[01:47:30]  Because look at me  I could not possibly have these feelings or agree with anything anyone said  It's amazing  Every newscaster has to editorialize before they tell the story  Look, hey, I'm much too good to think like this  But the fact that this shows you the type of a fucking pussy country we live in  The fact that a guy who has an unpopular or even stupid opinion is considered news  And he's fired for it 
[01:48:00]  I think his opinion was dumb  I think he was an asshole for saying it  But the fact that that can cost you your job  Just shows you what a sickening country we live in  And there was a time it didn't cost you your job  Well, 1861  But he didn't say anything about race  There's no racial problem  Alright, well  If you hear about this story  He's a former NBA player  He played for the Phoenix Suns, Chicago Bulls  But never really gained that much notoriety  Well, he wrote an open letter  And in the letter it starts off with 
[01:48:30]  I don't know if what I'm about to write makes me a monster  But take a listen to the rest of it  Well, he's setting it up  Saying, look  Look, I don't know  But here's my thoughts  That I am free to express  In America  Yes  Well, not really free anymore  Because, you know  There are consequences  Major consequences  Consequences, consequences  As long as I'm rich  You can't just speak your mind anymore  Because there's going to be consequences  In this case, your job  How come people who always talk about  You can't speak your mind  Always talk about how awful 
[01:49:00]  The Catholic Church is  And Bush  But why do they never  Say when you say things  That are unpopular like this  That have anything to do with race  Or anything to do with black, white  You're in deep trouble  How come people never say that  As a sign of how America  Is not truly a free place  To express your opinions  And this same twat newscaster  I would love to hear her introduction  Again, back to it  The black Columbia professor  That punched his white co-worker  Woman in the face  After a racial argument  Do you understand?  Did she come out and go  Did you hear this professor?  Well, you're going to wish you hadn't 
[01:49:30]  I guarantee you  She didn't cover it like that  Phony bitch  You hadn't  Let's listen to what he has to say  I bet you  I really haven't heard this yet  I haven't yet either  I bet you there's some truths in this  Alright  Maybe truths that people don't want to hear  Yeah  I've read it  I thought he was an asshole for saying it  Okay  It was idiotic and pointless  Okay  Was it?  Yeah  Listen to the rest of it  It reads  This is just an excerpt from it  Because it really is a long letter  Dear Haitians  First of all, kudos on developing  The poorest country in the western hemisphere  Your commitment to human rights  Infrastructure and birth control 
[01:50:00]  Should be applauded  As we prepare to assist you  In this difficult time  A polite request  If it's possible  Could you not rebuild your island home  In the image of its predecessor?  Could you not resort to the creation  Of flimsy shanty and shack towns?  And could maybe some of you  Use a condom once in a while?  Sincerely, the rest of the world  He says  He feels like he is voicing  What a lot of people might be thinking  That are not saying  And as you read the extensive letter  He goes on to compare it to Katrina  And the tsunami  And saying something along the lines of  If you rebuild your house 
[01:50:30]  On a lower level  Knowing it could flood  Maybe it's your fault  Maybe we shouldn't be responsible  And he goes clearly on to say  He's not donating a cent  Alright  If he wrote this  Before the earthquake  Not even news  Not even news  After earthquake  Now we all have to be like  Hey, be sensitive  A lot of people died  Which they did  A lot of people died  Over 150,000 people killed  Aid coming in from all over the world  It is a very poor country 
[01:51:00]  But  But  My but is  What did he say there  That was  So bad  Timing wise  Pretty bad  People are suffering  Obviously you don't  You don't rub salt in the wounds  As they say  But what did he say there  That was so awful  And so bad  The guy's a jerk off  Because  It's the equivalent  Of writing  After 9-11  Hey  You  You know  You don't want to get killed 
[01:51:30]  And jump out of high windows  Then don't work on high floors  Work on the ground floor  Or don't take a job  I mean  It's the same jerk off level  Is that  I don't  I don't  I don't buy that  Analogy at all  It's just  That was  A natural disaster  The whole thing of just  Being an impoverished nation  When you have a corrupt government  Which kept their people in poverty  Which is why they lived in shitholes  And why  You know  It's  I don't see how the guy  Except for  His  Poor timing 
[01:52:00]  And  You know  It's in bad taste  To  To put that out now  While people are suffering  And stuff like that  But  The truth of the matter is  They are a poor country  The government  Corrupt as all fucking hell  Kept their own people in poverty  It's still though  It's the tone of it  If he was giving genuine advice  Like  Look  Wear a condom  Isn't genuine advice  What's that got to do with  But economy  Stop having a thousand fucking children  So maybe  You could take your own kids  Take care of them 
[01:52:30]  And maybe  Educate them better  Because there wouldn't be  So many children to teach  Teach them how to farm  How to  Have  Raise cattle  Fish  Whatever the fuck  It's still  It's still a jerk  He's being a jerk off  He's not being genuine  He's being a jerk off  It's like the tone of it is obvious  He's just being a jerk off  And I'm not saying  He should be fired for that  Because I really don't  Like I don't like the guy's opinion  He shouldn't be fired  And he should have the right to say it  Absolutely not be fired  He should have the right to say that 
[01:53:00]  Without losing his livelihood  And Anthony's brought up a lot  You should have the right to say  Awful things  Absolutely  In this country  It's like  That's what freedom of speech is  But that's not a real  Not just stuff you agree with  To me he's  That's not  What he's saying is not genuine  Like  It's almost like  He's just using this  As an excuse to say something  Going well hey  I'm only saying it for this  That sounded very genuine  If you ask me  That sounded like  That's how he feels  It is  Genuinely  He's being a prick  Yeah well  And what's the difference  Between that and 9-11 
[01:53:30]  Other than the natural disaster  When I'm saying the tone of it  When the tone of it  Is to be shitty  That's what it is  Because  Well Christopher Reeve  How about this  Christopher Reeve rides a horse  I've made a lot of jokes about it  But it's the same as coming out  And going hey  You don't want to be paralyzed  Below the neck  Don't ride horses  Technically you're correct  Right  And in a court of law  They couldn't  They couldn't sue you for libel  But you're still being a jerk off  By saying that as genuine advice  And you're hiding behind the fact of  Hey I'm giving genuine advice 
[01:54:00]  But really there's an underlying  I'm being a prick motive  I don't know  People aren't being solicited  To give him money  After he broke his back  It's  How can he speak for the rest of the world though?  How does he know how the rest of the world feels?  Well that was a dumb  Obviously  I'm not agreeing with every word  This guy said verbatim  I'm just saying  The idea behind what he was saying  Is something that people do think  They do think  Look  You're an underdeveloped nation  In a hemisphere that is predominantly developed 
[01:54:30]  You share an island  There's nothing but a border  Between them and the Dominican Republic  And the Dominican Republic  Has seemed to have mastered farming  And fishing  And using their natural resources  To build themselves up  What is their problem?  What is the problem with Haiti?  Why is that?  A line drawn in the dirt  On the same fucking island  The same people  Why so different?  I think what he's doing 
[01:55:00]  What makes me think the guy's a jerk off  Is that he's attacking  He's being a cunt to the people  And look  I'm not saying that  Yeah they should rebuild shanty towns  But there's a way to do that  Where you understand  It's like we all have the  Commonality of language  So we understand intent  Hey the Giants killed the Jets  We don't think they really murdered them  So we understand what somebody is saying  Sometimes by the way they phrase things  And he's not just giving genuine advice  Like look  As horrible as this is  Try to rebuild without doing this or that  And try to get a better government in there 
[01:55:30]  So structurally you'll be sounder  But that's not what he's doing  He's being a fucking twat  Because when people are buried under rubble  Hey wear a condom once in a while  You're being a cunt  And everybody knows you're being a cunt  But that's exactly what I said  The timing of this  Is bad  Is very bad  And if it was written  Before the earthquake  Wouldn't have been news  Probably not  Wouldn't have been news  Because  He probably wouldn't have written it  He probably wouldn't have written it  You're right  But if he had  Most people would have looked at that 
[01:56:00]  And said  Wow you know something  It's got a point there  But  Because they're in the midst of tragedy  It  It's a  Sensitive situation  And  The guy's not allowed to  Voice it  He should be allowed to voice it  Even though I think he's a complete scumbag  He should be allowed to voice it  He should be allowed to voice it  Agree to disagree  Well I don't even know if we disagree  I just think  I think we disagree  What?  Agree to disagree on whether we disagree?  You can't say his motive is to be genuinely helpful 
[01:56:30]  He's being a prick  What do you do for a living character?  Well  I used to play basketball  And since I throw a ball in a hoop  For some reason now  I think that my  My social political commentary  Means something  Oh shit  Let's say hi to Jim in Jersey  Jim  I'm right here  I know  That's so weird  Hey how's it going?  I got the phone too  How about that reporter in the beginning  When he asked  Do you know Paul Shirley?  He goes  The basketball player?  No  Oh really?  How do you know?  Yeah  How do you know he's a basketball player  If you didn't know who he was?  Exactly  Oh we didn't pick up on that  He goes  Oh the basketball player?  No  Well you knew that he was the basketball player 
[01:57:00]  So I guess you do sort of know who the guy is  Yeah  Alright  I don't know  Being sarcastic  Hey look  Hey look all Khaled Mohammed was doing  When he was speaking for Louis Farrakhan  Was expressing unpopular opinions  And I disagree with what he said  And I still back his right to say it too  It's no different  He was saying that basically South Africa should be overrun  And they should kill every man, woman and child  That was how he felt  That's how you get black people back to 
[01:57:30]  Or get the invading Dutch or whatever it was  Out of South Africa  That was his solution  And you know people gave him shit for it  They're like you know you're being a scumbag  You're not trying to give a genuine solution  You're being  You're just expressing something to be nasty  And people kind of sense the difference  Well that's kind of a  I don't know  That's a little violent  But this guy's pretty much  What he was saying was  Look  Your lifestyle  The way you  Are such an underdeveloped nation 
[01:58:00]  Surrounded by  You know relative wealth  He's using the earthquake  As an excuse to attack them for shit  That he already didn't like them for  Okay  The earthquake is not  I'll agree with that  Because it's like  This is why it's not genuine  Because if he had just written that  What does the AIDS  Or condoms  Or underdevelopment  Have to do with the earthquake  It just had nothing to do with it  It really is  Not the same thing  Well now he's talking about  The rebuilding portion  Now if all this money  Is being shipped into Haiti  Which it is  Where is 
[01:58:30]  Where is it going to go  Is it going to go  Are people just going to rebuild shanties  Waiting for another earthquake  Is this an opportunity  For a legitimate  Non-corrupt government  To get in there  For people to  Maybe the Americans  That are there already  For them to teach  And train people  I hate using that  Teach a person to fish  Give them a fish thing  I don't think they're bringing in enough money  To accomplish all that  For real  I know a lot of money is going to Haiti  But I don't think it's enough to  I think it's just enough money 
[01:59:00]  To get these people back on their feet  And not much else  But they had nothing to begin with  No I understand that  It's like  But it's not like they're getting so much money  That their lives are going to be  That much better  When this is all over with  When you have a government  That is as corrupt  As the Haitian government  Yeah they got to take care of their own  There's nothing they can do  It goes back to your theme  They got to take care of their own  Yeah  Yeah well that's true  Did he say the same thing  About San Francisco  When they got devastated  Back during the World Series  A few years ago  Whenever that was  Did he say the same things 
[01:59:30]  About that  About hey people of San Francisco  You just move out  Don't live there  If you don't want to be killed  In an earthquake  No I think his letter  Would have probably been more like  Hey San Francisco  What are you going to do  Just rebuild the bridges  So they collapse on top of each other  Like pancakes  And kill each other again  Which by the way  They didn't  They saw what happened  They took into account  What an earthquake does  To certain structures  And fixed it  And that's I think  Was part of his point 
[02:00:00]  It's covered in  Like you said  He had ulterior motives beforehand  Obviously he didn't like  The Haitian people  So he should have just  Come out and said that  Instead of  Instead of fucking  Poorly disguising it  Behind  Hey I'm just saying  Hey I'm  How about you stop being a faggot  And just say what you want to say  I don't like Haitian people  This is how I feel  You understand  You don't need an excuse to say it  Let me jump in here  With Mike in Indiana  Mike  He might have more on this  Go ahead Mike  Hey good morning boys  Hey  Hey  Why not just get a copy 
[02:00:30]  Of the whole letter  I mean you guys are  And everybody  The media  They're judging this dude  On just like the news lady said  An excerpt of the letter  He may have had something  A lot more to say  Do you read the whole letter  That's what you do  Character  What do you do for a living  Character  What do you do for a living  Character  Do you read the whole letter  Alright fair enough man  We should see the whole letter  Maybe there is more to it  Okay  Maybe Mike's right on this one  But hey  Do me a favor  Wear a condom  Sincerely  The rest of the world  I can't see anything else  In the letter  Making him not a jerk  And it's not the rest of the world  Africa wouldn't believe in that 
[02:01:00]  Is that the whole letter  That's the whole thing  We did the whole thing  Oh we did the whole letter  It was a short little note  Alright well  Sincerely the rest of the world  That's a little pompous  Well that's what I said  Africa wouldn't believe in that  They're all for not wearing condoms  Right  So is he  Wait hold on  Let's see  Is he really saying kudos  On developing the poorest country  In the western hemisphere  That obviously is sarcasm  Oh he's being a prick  Okay so your commitment  To human rights  Infrastructure  And birth control  Should be applauded  What the fuck  More sarcasm 
[02:01:30]  Do those things have to do  With people being buried alive  In an earthquake  Nothing  He's being a cunt  You know what  But there is something there  They weren't able to  React  To a natural disaster  In a way that  They didn't need  The assistance  From the entire world  To help them  Dude  We didn't need  The world's assistance  But look at how  We as a country  The most advanced civilization  Ever  Quote unquote  Handled Katrina 
[02:02:00]  Abysmally  An abysmal job  And there are a lot  Of theories and things  About why that happened  The way it did  I'm just saying  Logistically  Yeah that was really  Fucked up  We had everything we needed  We had the resources  FEMA sucked  And Ray Nagin's an idiot  Yeah  I think Ray Nagin  The mayor  Is the mayor right  Is an idiot  And I think he handled it terribly  And I think that a lot of people  Didn't want to leave early  The resources  Absolutely were there though  And were here  How long it took  To get him there  The logistics of transporting shit  Fuck up 
[02:02:30]  Things like that  But when you have a country  Like Haiti  They are vulnerable  To natural disasters  Without even thinking  What would we do  If this happens  No contingency plan  No money  To back it up  No emergency rescue crews  That they themselves  Can help themselves  And I understand  This happens all over the world  But again  This is a country  That's surrounded by  Pretty wealthy nations 
[02:03:00]  They're doing pretty well  The earthquake  Did Port-au-Prince  Pretty bad too  It devastated the capital  Yeah the location  Of the earthquake  Certainly didn't help matters either  I'm not agreeing  The most developed area of Haiti  Was fucking destroyed  Yeah  And I don't think  The shantytowns  You know what  I'm going to guess  There was a lot less deaths there  Because they're all  Fucking little flimsy  Little flimsy  Shitty shacks  You're much less likely  To be crushed  Under a shitty little  Flimsy fucking piece of metal  Hey let's go to  Matt in Arkansas  He did some time in Haiti  Matt 
[02:03:30]  Hey what's happening guys  What's up  Hi Matt  Hey listen  I was actually  Over there about 12 years ago  I was in the Air Force  And I was stationed at an army base  And we were immunizing  And vaccinating  A lot of the children over there  And as I say  A lot of people  Didn't want us there in Haiti  And would throw stuff at us  And we could get off the base  Without  You know  Even the medical group  Had to have a pistol on them  But  Point being  With the letter  The letter this guy said  About condoms 
[02:04:00]  Is completely true  I don't know if you know this  But  A huge population  Over in Haiti  Is HIV positive  Yes we do know that  Yes so they're actually  Not only are they just  Multiplying by the tons  They're spreading HIV  As they do it  But again  Even though you're correct  Technically  And again in a court of law  They couldn't  Fault them for lying  But what he's saying is  Is ridiculous  And he's being a scumbag  By saying it  Because it's not related  To what happened  That's like  A woman who gets raped 
[02:04:30]  And after she gets raped  You say  Oh by the way  Go back and take night classes  So you can get a better job  Stupid  It's irrelevant  It's irrelevant  To what happened  And you're using  What happened  To springboard  Into just being a twat  Which is what he's doing  As  Okay then  Let me put it  In these terms  Does he have the right  To be a little outraged  As a taxpayer  That a lot of tax money  Is going over there  And he can't  Voice his opinion  That his  Some of his money  Is going over there  To do this 
[02:05:00]  To help these people  When he doesn't think  They are helping  Themselves enough  What's the question  Yeah like  He's spending money  He is  The government  Is taking  His money  My money  Your money  Sending it over there  To help these people  Meanwhile  He should be able to say  Hey  Put a fucking condom on  Well I agree with you  In the sense that  I don't think he should be  Fired for his opinion  I don't like his opinion  I'm only saying  What a cunt  I think he is  As a man  Like for doing it  But I don't think  He should be fired for it  Like I said  Only a timing issue 
[02:05:30]  That's the only problem  I have with his letter  I think the sarcasm  Kind of funny  The kudos thing  Yeah  Kudos  Whenever you use  The word kudos  But it's a timing issue  He obviously should have  Either held back  A lot of people  Very sensitive right now  Earlier  Or held back  For a while  So this is going to be  A bit of an outrage  It's not even like  He's trying to be funny  It's not like he's doing  A joke about it  Or something like that  He's just using it  To make a real point  But he's just being  A trick while he's doing it  You don't think  You should be fired right  I do not  No  Anyone that says  I'm a hypocrite 
[02:06:00]  I don't want him fired  You make that clear  Do not want him fired  I'd be confused  By your message  Jimmy in Staten Island  Jimmy  Yes  You know what I think  Is outrageous also  Is that once again  We have to go  Into our pockets  To go help a country  That can't help themselves  Okay  And we have to  Be the most responsible ones  And just turn around  And help  Help  Help  Who has stuff  I sell Toyotas  Okay  And we've got this whole thing  Good luck to you 
[02:06:30]  Oh fuck  So what is it  It's like  I don't have enough  Bullshit to deal with  But now  But now  Okay  Who helps me  Who helps me  Well I have to go  Into my pocket  And on my telephone  But thanks  90999  Because you feel  Catholic guilt  To send $10  And probably  I'm going to get  Those fucking people  Because the French  Fucking  We're both  We're the fucking  Bastards  Packet all the money  And fuck the people  It's bullshit  But just  You know  Even  It's helping people  Who are buried alive 
[02:07:00]  In rubble  I think as a country  I don't mind  Us spending money  Doing that  It's like  That's true  There's so many  Wastes of money  Here  That we can  Help other Americans  With  You're absolutely right  But it's like  Sending fucking money  To  Rwanda  And sending it to  Somalia  When you know  You can't  We're just supposed  To send money there  And hope  That they know  How to manage it  And deal it out  In the right  Fucking places  Where it needs to be  No  It's not going to work 
[02:07:30]  It's a waste  Of money  Now in a disaster  Like this  Initial response  Abso-fucking-lutely  I'm not going to sit here  And say  The initial response  Shouldn't be  Send troops over  Send money over  Get a  Food and water  To the people  Get rescue teams  Over there  Everything  Perfect  But now  What's going to  Happen next  Are we just going to  Sit and watch  The same bullshit  Happen in Haiti  After they build  Their buildings back  Because everyone does  They'll rebuild  And what  The same shit  Government  The same shit 
[02:08:00]  Fucking construction  Of their  Civilian housing  And people  Fucking  I won't say that  But people doing  A lot of fucking  Without birth control  With an out of control  Population  That is unemployed  Dirt poor  And has no  Fucking future  This is an article  Today  Less than a penny  Of each US dollar  On the earthquake relief  Is going to the  Haitian government  That makes it sound  Worse than it really is  That's a good thing 
[02:08:30]  That's an excellent thing  Yeah  It's saying  They break it down  Most money's going  Right to the people  Relief experts  Say it would be  A mistake  To send too much  Direct cash  To the Haitian government  Because they're  Unstable  Routinely included  On a list  Of the world's  Most corrupt countries  So the US government  Knows that  Of each US tax dollar  42 cents  Funds US AIDS  Disaster assistance  Another 33 cents  Is going to the military  Paying for security  Search and rescue teams  And the Navy hospital  Ships  USNS Comfort  And under a dime  Has already been spent  On food  They break it down  So less than a penny 
[02:09:00]  Is going to the  Corrupt government  So the money  Is probably being broken down  Close to what most people  Is a penny  There's not even one  To give to the tax collector  Penny please  Paul Shirley  Not going to come over here  And play basketball  No one like Paul Shirley  Caribbean Jimmy  God damn it  You guys  Oh my god  Oh really  Alright  Let's listen to Tom  Tom from Jersey  Sure Tom  Go ahead  Hey what's up guys 
[02:09:30]  Listen  That government  Is so messed up  They exiled two dictators  Papa Doc  Baby Doc  Yeah we remember  The Docs  Then the people  Elected  This Jean Batiste guy  Who was a priest  And was supposed to be  For the people  He was corrupted  In three freaking months  Yeah  Boom  He took all the money  In Haiti  If a chick walks  Into your house  Of her own accord  You can rape her 
[02:10:00]  It's legal  Alright so  There's some good stuff  We are here  Yes  Pass that law here  Well yeah  That's what I'm going for  But hey  We're money just  Fucking believable  Tom  What do you do  For a living character  Thank you Tom  Let's go to Shane  In uh  Where are we going  Shane in Ohio  It looks like  Shane  Hey what's going on guys  Hey buddy  Hey man  Hey I just want to say  It's bullshit man  That like  We give more than  Any other country  In the world  And not even  Just our government 
[02:10:30]  Just us as a population  We give more than anywhere  And they hate us man  We should just  Cut them all off man  Fuck the aid  Fuck all that shit man  Let them starve  Let them rot  I don't think there's  An on off  To who we should help  Or not help us out  But I do think  We give aid  To too many countries  I think some of them  Should just be cut off  Completely  Nations that are  Just bottomless pits  Of money  They can't be  Fucking taught  To live together  Without hacking 
[02:11:00]  Each other apart  Civil war  Slavery  That is still running  Rampant by the way  Genocide  And we just decide  Well we gotta  At least feed the children  The children grow up  To become militants  Under war lords  So I don't understand  What we're doing  Does this sound cruel  Fuck yes  I see the commercials  At night with the flies  And the bloated bellies  And the fucking river  And shit  In the middle of town  But you know what  It's just Bob Kelly fishing  Unless there's 
[02:11:30]  A fucking game plan  We can't get involved  Politically  We tried getting involved  Militarily in Somalia  So it happened there  I don't know about you  But I sure  I'm not happy  Watching American lives  Being sacrificed  With people that  Do not want it  Do not want it  In any circumstance  But they still  Keep pouring money  Into these places  And I don't think  It's worth it  I agree with you  Again helping people 
[02:12:00]  In a time like this  Fine  You're buried alive  Tsunami  Same thing  Any type of a disaster  Where there's just  There's just a fucking  Society that's been  Completely decimate  I don't mind helping  But I agree with you  We are putting on  Fucking dumb US faces  And everybody else  And we get it smacked  Every fucking time too  No matter if we're  Doing good  Or we're doing stuff  In our own self interest  Whatever it is  We get smacked  We get bitch slapped  For being the big guy  On the block  That you know  Helps  We're supposed to be  The big wealthy nation  That's supposed to go in 
[02:12:30]  But the second we do  We're assholes  Meanwhile look at the  Amount of money  That's given to  Countries in need  The United States  Tops the fucking list  China's pocketing  Every fucking dime  That the whole world  Is giving them now  Because they're  All of a sudden  This industrial fucking  Dynamo  And look at the  Amount of money  They put out  To help fucking the world  They don't give a shit  Well they don't have  Any emotions  So they don't really  Understand why this is  Fothersome  Yes  Let's go to Jeremy  In Jersey  Jeremy  How you boys doing 
[02:13:00]  Alright Jeremy  And I love you  But I gotta ask  Is anything  In American  Or world history  Ever happened  To a black person  That you felt bad about  That you didn't  Justify some negative  Comment to  I mean  I'm fucking with you  But I'm half serious  To a black person  That I  Whatever  Something like  Katrina  The tsunami  Years ago  Not fun  Tsunami was Asian  Black person  I mean  I'm sorry  Let me correct myself  But any kind of  Brown person  Of any shade 
[02:13:30]  Where you  You just  You looked at it  Strictly from your emotions  Not from  You know  Some  Some pundit  Respond  I'll give you  I gave you an example  Just before  The Rwanda situation  Years ago  With the Hutu  And the Tutsis  That was genocide  And it was  Despicable  And the fact that  The United Nations  Went in there  With vaginas  And did nothing  To help that situation  Out  Was ridiculous 
[02:14:00]  And let it continue  Whose side  Whose side  Were you on  The lighter skin  Black  I was on the  Lighter skin  Black side  The Tutsis  I believe  You look at it  So much  No  I understand  Look  Call it what you like  But I just don't like  When nations  Are dependent  On other nations  Without an end game  We need  Some kind of an end game  And if that just happens  Around the world  To include  A disproportionate 
[02:14:30]  Number of countries  That are populated  By a majority  Of black people  Then it looks like  I'm just picking out  Black people  But I'm picking out  Nations  That are inherently  They just  They  We need  Development  In some of these nations  So they can be  Self-sufficient  Instead of us  Just pumping  Fucking money in  Year after year  And then you go back  Years later  And see  Nothing has changed  And cut  Thank you sir 
[02:15:00]  Thank you  Alright  I think we made our point  A lot of people  Calling with pretty much  The same stuff  I try to word things  So I don't get fired  No kidding  You don't think I know  I do the dance  We're going to take a break  We got another  Lawyer Ron call  To do  Into break here  I didn't say the end game  I said the end game  Ron the lawyer  The latest star  On the Opie and Anthony show  He was in yesterday  And man  Man he went at it  With the phone calls  Here's another one  Of those phone calls  Gotta wish

[02:43:30]  To make the news back then  Two janitors  Were caught on video  Doing coke  In the principal's office  And stealing computers  And walking out with them  And putting them into a car  All caught on camera  Really  Yeah  Damn yo  What's wrong with this school  That place am fucked up  Is it  Is it  What kind of school is it  I know it's a high school  But I mean  Is it  What's the makeup of the students  Yeah  Is it in a poor area  Brooklyn  You know 
[02:44:00]  Give us some details  It's actually  Nah it's in a very nice neighborhood  Actually  It's about  20  This was actually a question  Both my parents had asked about  Before I  Oh let's see  Student ethnicity  We're looking at  Just about 50% white  Yeah  About  I'd say  30% black  And the rest is made up  Of Asian  Hispanic  Equally split  With a little  Native American  So you guys  That slice is very thin  That slice is very thin  Very very thin 
[02:44:30]  So it's  A lot of Russians too  A lot of that white  Ah that's good  The Russian girls  They like the sexy  They like to make the sexy  It's a melting pot  Yeah well  It's a little of everything  But it's  It's a  Predominantly white  And Hispanic  Then you got that  Yeah it is a melting pot  You're right  And female to male  A little bit more male  Than female  Okay  Alright  That's usually the case  Right  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Down there  Well 
[02:45:00]  What have we got  Going on here  Gym teacher  Yeah  I wish  It had  All right  Yeah  Thank you Andrew  Later boys  That is very good  Alright  Wow  James Madison  Who knew  Who knew when he was president  That it would turn into  My high school  Is going to be  A sex high school  Lesbo high  A sex high school  Yeah  Should we take a little break  Let's take a breather  No  Keep going  I'll fucking keep going 
[02:45:30]  All day long  I'll do this all fucking day  As long as all the nice  Reads get in  Or until 1045  Comes around  So we could have our  122nd meeting  After the show  We do have a 122nd meeting today  We have a 122nd meeting  I love how they're  Finally seeing it our way  They completely understand  We just will not  Stick around this joint  So now it's like  Hey can I have you  For two minutes  Two minutes  And we actually  Thought about it  We're like  Alright  I was ready to bargain  For like a minute and a half 
[02:46:00]  So I was ready to bargain  Alright we'll give you  Two minutes today  Better speak fast  You want another lawyer call  Going into break  Yes  Have we overdone  This lawyer thing  No this guy's a scream  Yeah I think we should  It's a regular riot  I think we should play  All of them today  And then we're going to get  Ron the lawyer on the show  In the near future  Hopefully  Ron  We're just trying to figure out  An angle  Something that kind of makes sense  Although he'll be like  Legal analyst  Yeah he'll be a guy  We could go to  When some big stories hit  It always happens  Fox has him every day  Legal analyst  CNN has him 
[02:46:30]  Right  Now we'll have a legal analyst  This guy just happens to have  Quite the potty mouth  Oh boy does he  He went at it with the callers yesterday  Here's another one of those calls  Anthony  Let me tell you what's going on  In the world today  Can't catch up  Remember  We're seers on this show  We really are  Yes  I just hope people start recognizing that  We see stuff before it happens  And then  I don't know  A little time goes by  And then there it is 
[02:47:00]  And black and white  Right in front of you  It means it's true  Remember when Avatar came out  And I said this is going to change movie making  I think I was  This is fucked up  I was just going to bring this up  I had the same thing  I was going to bring up  And I'm not saying  When we see this shit  That it's not obvious stuff  Yeah  But we are the first people  Saying it  Home  But this is another obvious one  Avatar  With that 3D thing  We went right on the air  And said holy crap  How do you even  Put out a movie  That's not in 3D  Yeah  And by the way  Making that much money 
[02:47:30]  And the other point I want to make  Because we talk about this too  Especially you Anthony  But I'm there as well  Our systems at home  Are way better  Than movie theaters  Right  Yeah  When I go to a movie theater  I get so fucking frustrated  I'm like  This fucking movie  Should look way better  Than it does on that big screen  It should be  Yeah it's so grainy  It should be in high def  And digital  And all that crap  Well now that they're going to  Pretty much make every movie in 3D  It saves these theaters  Because we don't really have  That technology at home yet  Not yet  Right  You know what I mean 
[02:48:00]  So it might have saved  A lot of these theaters  From having to  Remodel the entire place  Because that's I guess  What the problem is  It's going to cost  Way too much money  To update these movie theaters  Yeah  So with that said  We said  Alright Avatar  3D  How do you make an action flick  Especially  Or a movie that visually  Looks really good  Without using 3D  And it came out  Today  The final two Harry Potter movies  Will be released in 3D  And I bet you  They weren't even thinking that  Until Avatar  Probably weren't  Probably weren't 
[02:48:30]  They probably heard  People starting to talk  About this Avatar movie  And how it's going to  Change things  But now that it's out  And now it's what  The  Officially the number one movie ever  Yeah  As far as money made  Now  You know  All these other big films  Have to go 3D  They just have to  Oh  Hermione's  Little boobies in 3D  Hermione's boobies  In 3D  You think you'll be able  To reach out  Feeling like you can touch them  I will  I will go to the movies  Just to do that  Every time she's on screen  I'm just going to  Put my hands out 
[02:49:00]  And squeeze the air  In front of me  To horrify the patrons  I think it was that stupid  Superman movie  Where they had the first  Five minutes in 3D  That's  You know  Yeah yeah  A couple years back  And when the plane was crashing  Or whatever  And there was stuff  Floating around  Yeah  I was one of those  Dumbies  Were you grabbing things  I was trying to reach out  I think it was a cell phone  Just floating there  I'm like  I want to see  I want to see  What it looks like  As I try to grab the cell phone  Well they got those 3D movies  At Disney  They have a few of those  You know  The Muppet one 
[02:49:30]  And then they got  The Terminator one  And stuff like that  And Honey I Shrunk the Audience  And things like that  And  But that like  That's the way  Shit's coming out at you  Right  So everybody goes  Wow  Like that  These are just movies  In 3D  Where it's not shit  Coming out at you  But it's 3D  Sure  Alright  Now all movies  Are going to be like this  I think  Yeah  I think big budget films  Have to go 3D now  I think it's over  What was that list  You just had up there  Dan  Clash of the Titans  Coming out in 3D  And Alice in Wonderland too  Well what did 
[02:50:00]  Johnny Depp  And well  Tim Burton's adaptation  Of Alice in Wonderland  I can't wait  That's coming out in March right  Or February  Yeah March  Early March  And the weird thing is  That as part of  Alice in Wonderland's marketing  I haven't seen anything  In regards to 3D  Until  After  Avatar  Alright now all of a sudden  I see around the city here  There's some  You know  Some bus ads and stuff  That says Alice in Wonderland  In 3D  And I'm like  Well because that's the hot word right now  Everybody wants to see 3D films now  And apparently it doesn't cost that much 
[02:50:30]  To convert these films to 3D  I think it's only like 5 million per  So it's fucked up  So was Alice in Wonderland  Shot  Knowing they were going to use  The 3D technology  Or did they  Adjust after  I'm not sure  No you know what  I don't think  I think you can take  Your print  Whatever  Double it  Whatever they need to do  To 3D it  And then  Offset the lines  You know how they do that  That's why your glasses  I don't think you need to shoot it  With a special 3D camera  But knowing you're using  The 3D technology  You're going to like 
[02:51:00]  Oh you'll film it differently  You're going to do different things  Within the film  Just  You know what I mean  To enhance the  The experience  I guess  But Harry Potter  Kind of a fan  Of these movies  The last one  I didn't really like  That in 3D  Could be fucking  Some cool stuff  Next to work  Well I feel like  I'm in Hogwarts  I'm walking the halls  I'm in the halls  Of Hogwarts  That wizardry  In 3D  Right Jimmy  Wizardry  Right Jimmy  Wizardry 
[02:51:30]  Yes Jimmy  Yes  So that was announced  Harry Potter  The final two movies  Will be released  In 3D  Yeah huh  Who else  Is going to be  In that god damn  Alice in Wonderland  Any hotties  Any hot chicks  Who plays Alice  Oh that's a good question  One pill  Makes  Makes you  That's one of  Patty's favorites  To sing  Oh good  Hey do we have that  And try to find  Patty doing  Small

[02:53:00]  I saw the Toy Story  Movies  When they  Were re-released  In 3D  And I thought  You know  I've seen these movies  A lot  A number of times  How good could it be  And I gotta admit  It was actually  A pretty cool experience  It really had the level  Of  Especially that  Like the Pixar animation  It really  It really  Had something to it  And Anthony  Please promise us  You'll get a video  Of you trying to

[02:58:30]  Good or bad  Do you have a theory  Based on last season?  Because I got one  No not really  Here's my theory  They reset  Completely  Reset  Completely reset  We get to see them  Go  To Los Angeles  Get off the plane  And start living their lives  Like they would have  If the plane never crashed  Which means also  That you know  Ben and the guys  Are on the island still  So we get to see the island  Them  That  And then something's  Going to happen  Because of this  Fate thing  And everything  That brings them back together 
[02:59:00]  And brings the island  Back into their lives  And shit like that  Proving that they just  Could never ever  Get away from it  But initially  Reset  We get to see  What their lives  Would have been like  If it never crashed  Which brings back  The entire cast  Because no one died  It would have been great  So we get to see  All that shit  That's my theory  And it's proven  Because I saw that clip  Of the chicken  The chicken place  Have you seen that yet  Travis?  The um  Yeah what's his name  Hurley's chicken place  That got hit by the 
[02:59:30]  Asteroid or something  And he's selling chicken  He goes  During a recent vacation  In Australia  Which proves  That they come back  I'm lost  That's true  Because the poster  Is like the Last Supper  Yes  And who's turned around  In it?

[03:03:30]  Threw his eyes up  And left  Let me just say this  We spoke with  The lovely Bill Burr  We spoke with Robert Kelly  Who was trashing the movie  By the way  Yeah  And you  We could send you the tape  If you like  Yeah  And he  He put the blame on you  Bill Burr  Kind of said  Hey I'm out here in LA  I don't know what the fuck  Is going on  And you pretty much  Have the blame now  For saying 
[03:04:00]  Well you know  We're not even going  To ask Jimmy  Okay  Alright  Well I mean  It's so unlike Bobby  To throw another guy  Under the bus completely  That's true  To save his own ass  It's just recently  That Bobby can fit  Under a bus  So give him some  Some credit  That is true  That is true  Bobby could not fit  Under a fucking bus  I can still do  Older Bobby  Was fat jokes  Which I like  You know 
[03:04:30]  He's not exactly  Thin right now  He's entering into  I believe  His sixth fatness  Yeah he says  He's got seven fats  He's got seven fats  In him he said  This is his sixth one  He's going to get  Back in shape  And then he says  He has like one  Maybe two more fats left  And that's it for his life  I would  I'd describe him  Right now  Right now  He's Dom DeLuise  On the Dean Martin show  He was Dom DeLuise  On Cannonball Run  So he goes through  Phases of Dom DeLuise  He's down to the  Skinniest Dom DeLuise 
[03:05:00]  Which is still kind of fat  Yeah the skinny incarnation  Yeah  Now what happened  Why isn't Jimmy  In your film  I'll tell you why  Because we didn't have a part  And then Bobby said  We had to  Doorman  Doorman  Doorman  Don't  Don't talk like  I don't know  Everything about  This situation  Rich Voss is playing  The stupid doorman  Yeah  And I think  Just because Bonnie  Is in the movie  Doesn't mean you gotta 
[03:05:30]  Trail that guy around  And put him in the movie  Well from  From the lips  Of Bobby Kelly  To my ears  Six months ago  Dude  You know  Norton  You know  We shouldn't ask  Norton to be in it  Dude  Because it's really  Not a huge part  So  You know  I don't wanna like  Fucking waste his time  Cause he's doing  A lot of big shit  And you know  Like it's not really  A huge part  Like if there was  Something bigger  We would ask Jim 
[03:06:00]  But it's not that big  So we shouldn't  There it is  Passing the buck  Back to Bob Kelly  Who's gonna be in tomorrow  The ball now  In Kelly's court  That's exactly  What he said  You said  He is so  Full  Of shit  He had the idea  Initially  To ask Jimmy  To be in it  He said first  We can get Norton  If we want  And I said okay  And then when I said  You know dude  Like what's up  Do you think  Norton might wanna  Do this part 
[03:06:30]  Or do you think  It's too small  Like what do you think  That was what  He said to me  You know dude  It's kinda small  And big  It's not really  A big pot  And that was  His exact  Fucking worst  Don't you  But don't you think  Though like  Just cause he's  He's a friend  And hangs out  And like just  To even be asked  Would have been nice  For little Jimmy  And that's why  Jimmy's not talking  To you right now  He's outside the studio  And we can't get him  Back in  I've been waving  Wait a minute  Flips us the bird  Nothing  Can you tell him  Please 
[03:07:00]  I feel terrible  I can't  I gotta be honest  With you guys  And this speaks  To my low self esteem  I'm shocked  That Jim even cares  To be honest with you  He's not talking  And he just gave  We all seen the face  He just gave the  Nah nah nah face  Nah nah  But it's just like  Being asked  Would have been like  You know  He just wanted to be asked  But also too  He's nodding his head  And giving a thumbs up  To that by the way  And I would think  For you guys  Like obviously  Alright we're not  You know  The next best thing  Since sliced bread 
[03:07:30]  But I mean  To have Jimmy in there  It would have been  Promoted a lot more  And stuff  I don't know  It just  It seems like  You really went  On an effort  To not put him  In this movie  Jimmy  Jimmy  Jimmy just pulled  His pants down  Pushed his fucking ass  Against the glass  And opened up  His asshole  For you  He left a sweaty  Pucker mark  On the window  Now it was  Fucking Jimmy  You guys  Did Bobby also  Explain fully  That this is not  My movie  Oh now he's 
[03:08:00]  Disavowing any  Knowledge of the movie  I think Bill Burr  Who was actually  Brave enough to call  Yesterday when all  This was going down  Said that this was  Your movie idea  Yep  No no no no  That you had  The initial idea  Yeah it was like  Your movie  No no no  Bob, Bill and me  We're equal partners  In this  We created  Just the three of us  So if any heat's  Coming down  It should fall  On the three of us  Equally  Bobby said  He's a producer  You are the director  Of this movie  You're the one  That really grabbed  The ball 
[03:08:30]  He said  You were in charge  Of casting  Oh well  Let me ask you  Gentlemen something  Yes  Who's usually  In charge of casting  Not a director  A casting director  Which falls under  The producer umbrella  So where was  Mr. Kelly  Producing  The producer  Is the guy  That comes along  And goes  Here's what we need  This part to look like  We need a guy  Like this here  That's a producer job  Did Bobby do any of that  No  He did show up  With water yesterday  That was a nice  Producer duty 
[03:09:00]  He fulfilled  But did he step in  And be a producer  And say  I want Jim Norton  In this role  No he didn't  No he fucking didn't  What do you do  For a living character  Character  Did the suit make it  Did the doorman suit  Make it on time  Because I know  That was  It did make it on time  Only because  Bill Burr  Had to yell at him  About it on the air  You know what  Because that was  Part of Bobby's  Responsibility too  I believe  And Joe  You got other  Problems too man  Because Ant and I  Are ready to do movies 
[03:09:30]  This would have been  A nice place to start  A little 15 minute  Independent film  I got some  Asking chops  Let me tell you something  I'd have been willing  To maybe contribute  Into the production  Cost myself  For a small part  That's right  We're not asking for much  I want to just walk  Through a scene  That's it  Mr. DeRosa  I will not do that picture  It's out of the question  Out of the question  I'll be  I'll be  Not to correct you  On your own show  But it's not a  15 minute film  According to 
[03:10:00]  Some of these  Twitter feeds  It's a 15 minute  Piece of shit  Fuck film  And I should get  Amed for it  Alright  Well that leads into  Let's hear some of  The tweets from  Our fine fans  To you  I believe they were  Tagging it  Fuck Joe DeRosa  By the way  I just want to remind you  That was going down Joe  Let's read  Read off some of  Some of your  Favorites there Joe  Nice pick you faggot  Your mouth looks like  It's all blown out  From taking uncut  Meat sticks  Why didn't you put  Little Jimmy in your movie 
[03:10:30]  Hey cancer arms  Why didn't you  Bill Burr and  Robert Kelly  Put fancy Jim Norton  In your 15 minute  Waste of film  I searched a dumpster  At the clinic  To find that abortion  Of a new movie  That you won't put  Jim Norton in  I think they let you  Off easy  To be honest with you  Yeah really 
[03:11:00]  No no  They get worse  Oh really  Get AIDS  Cunt  Fuck  Hold on  Just scroll through these  Holy shit  All this shit in here  About hats  Taking off your hat  I don't know  I don't know what  That means  Oh wow  There's a hat removal  Service that you  Should be calling up  There's a large  Gentleman of color  That would go around  To elderly women  And punch them  In the face  Yeah  And the news said  To rob them 
[03:11:30]  But we all knew  It was just a hat  Removal service  That he was  Giving  The lady didn't pay  For the hat  And the guy  Needed the hat back  Yes  He needed to remove  Bob Kelly's on the phone  Uh oh  So  Oh please work today  Bob  Yes  Alright  You were just  Completely thrown  Under the bus  By Joe DeRosa  Who is on the phone  Also  And uh  He said that  You're the one  That said  Let's not ask  Jimmy Norton  Because  He won't do the part  Well whatever the reason is  But you're responsible 
[03:12:00]  Yeah  You're responsible  For Jimmy not being in the movie  And uh Bob  Just so you know  Jimmy walked off our show  He doesn't want to talk to Joe  Well this is the thing  Is I can't believe  On a little independent film  You guys have fucking  Got into it  And ruined it  We'll never work together again  Wait what Bob  You've caused controversy  On our little fucking  Happy project  I've caused controversy  You hear what  It went on the radio yesterday  And started all this  I want to hear  It was a nice day 
[03:12:30]  And then all of a sudden  I'm getting called  A fucking camel moley  I'm going to talk to  Camel moley  Camel moley  That had nothing to do  With what we're talking about yet  Somebody randomly quitting you  Bobby I want to know  I want to know your  Your response to the fact  That Joe DeRosa  Completely  Completely turned around  What you said yesterday  He pretty much said  The exact same thing you said  Only turned it around  On you  Okay  Well I think  What basically happened was  I wanted to put Norton  In the movie  I suggested Norton 
[03:13:00]  And there was one part  That had like one line  I was like  No we need to give Norton lines  We need  Norton needs to say something  He can't just be in the background  He has to say something  You know people want to hear  They're not going to see him  They want to hear him  Say some shit  And be funny  They're comments  You've got to allow them  To be funny  Yeah  I don't think there was  I don't think there was  Anything for him to do  So now  You didn't answer my question  I wanted  Are you agreeing then  With Joe DeRosa  That you were the one  That said  No to Jimmy Norton 
[03:13:30]  No  I didn't say no  Someone said no  To Jimmy Norton  His name  His name was brought up  He's not in the movie  At some point  Someone had to say no  Bobby brought his name up  Bobby said  I said he needs to talk  Bobby said what  Bobby said what he just said  Which is a reiteration  Of what I said  That he said  So we're on the same page  And here's what  Everybody's missing  Here's what all these  Fuck Twitter  Cocksuckers are missing  We didn't ask him  Out of respect 
[03:14:00]  For his time  Oh that's good  Yeah don't ask him  Out of respect  You just fucking  Alienate him  As a friend  It's too bad  It's too bad  You can't tell that  To Jimmy personally  But he doesn't want  To talk to you guys  He's making the  Universal signal  Of  As he  Because he's listening  But he's making  The universal signal  For air jerking off  Which means bullshit  Is that what that means  Yeah  Yeah it does  You know when you  Jerk off in the air  I want to know  I want to know  What else  He said about me  What  I heard he said 
[03:14:30]  Some other shit about me  He was trashing me  He said I wasn't  He said you're not  You're not a  Yeah you were in charge  Of casting  Because you're the producer  And then he called you fat  And he also said  All you did was  Bring water to the set  Or something  Yeah you brought water  To the set  Which was just about  All you do  This is how  This is how  Serious Joe's  Taking himself  Yesterday he yelled  Quiet to everybody  And Colin went  Nobody was talking  Oh Colin's involved too  I forgot  Yes  Colin Quinn's involved too  Yet Jimmy Norton  Sits out  Anthony 
[03:15:00]  Can you  Anthony  On the QT  Can you shoot your scene  On Monday  Is that good for you  Yeah that's fine  What time though  It's gotta be  Around 12 o'clock  After the show  Right after though  Cause I gotta get out  Of New York  You gotta  Let's get down  Let's get down  To the bare bones  Of what happened yesterday  Bobby  My good buddy  Bobby Kelly  One of my good  Tight  Fucking  Friends  Went on the show  The night before  Was sitting there  With me going  We're partners  We're good buddies  Dude  I love  I never said buddy  I don't even talk like that 
[03:15:30]  Dude  It sounded exactly like it  You don't talk like that  And he went on the air  And you guys started  Fucking with him  And he grabbed the weakest  Guy in the room  And slid him right under  The fucking front  Of the bus  That's true  You're gutless Kelly  You're gutless  You're gutless  You guys just  You know  I can't see the  Out of respect thing  For Jimmy  It just seems like  You could have  At least said  Jimmy  We got a part  It's not much  But all of us  Are together  Doing this thing 
[03:16:00]  You know  Colin  And just for the guy  To be completely  Alienated  Not even know  About this project  Have to hear about it  On the streets  Like that  It just was  A little insulting  To Jimmy  I feel terrible  And well you should  Jimmy you want to come in  He ain't fucking  Coming back  He's still saying no  I want to be  Bill Burr's in the background  Yelling  All Jimmy wanted to do  Was turn us down  Fucking Burr  Fucking Burr  Yeah  Yeah  Our feelings are hurting
