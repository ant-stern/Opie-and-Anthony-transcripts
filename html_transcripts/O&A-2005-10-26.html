<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment centered around a recording of a furious mother screaming obscenities at her son, demanding his credit card for gas money. The son responded sarcastically, leading to extensive discussion about parental discipline, ranging from physical punishment to more modern methods. Callers shared their own experiences, including one describing removing their child's bedroom door, and another mentioning a police officer suggesting on-the-spot spankings to avoid legal issues.  Multiple audio clips were played, including longer versions of the initial argument and a similar altercation between a father and son. The hosts and callers frequently used profane language and shared off-color jokes and anecdotes.  A man even recounted hitting his father at age 12.


Following this, the show featured an in-studio interview with the band Mudvayne (Chad, Greg, Ryan, and Matt).  The conversation began with reminiscing about vacuum cleaners and included commercials for G4 TV's *The Man Show*, Paisano's restaurant, PlumChoice.com, and a "Whip them out Wednesday" promotion. The interview covered Mudvayne's touring experiences (including interactions with Black Sabbath's Bill Ward), creative process, listener feedback (including negative online comments), the origin of their name, and their preferences regarding fan interactions (specifically disliking unexpected photographs). The band members expressed mixed feelings about touring, with some preferring smaller venues.  A caller challenged their comments about the hardships of touring, and another noted their past use of face paint and masks, described by one member as "gay." Several callers expressed appreciation for their music. The conversation also included humorous and crude exchanges, discussions of blowjobs on tour buses, a phone call from comedian Jay Moore who shared anecdotes (including one about being naked in a hotel room), and a discussion of Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson's attractiveness.  The hosts also mentioned a "cup and toss" farting technique.


Next, a 14-minute mixtape created by a 16-17-year-old named Troy for his girlfriend Melissa was played.  The excessively effusive declarations of love prompted reactions from the hosts and callers, who speculated on Troy's virginity and the relationship's likely outcome (a breakup three days later).  The hosts and callers shared their own awkward romantic past experiences.  In-studio guests Patrice O'Neal (a comedian) and Vinny Brand (owner of the Stress Factory comedy club) engaged in a back-and-forth filled with insults and jokes. Patrice mentioned a recent hospitalization. The conversation included tangents about Anthony's dental procedure and a critique of comedian Voss and his girlfriend Bonnie's relationship.  The segment concluded with continued reactions to Troy's mixtape and mentions of upcoming acts at Vinny's club.  The language used throughout this segment was sexually explicit and offensive.


The show then shifted to a discussion of Don McLean's "American Pie," with the hosts speculating on its meaning. This was followed by a comedic bit impersonating Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper.  A caller from Oklahoma challenged their humor regarding Hurricane Katrina, leading to a hostile and homophobic exchange filled with insults and sexually explicit language.  The conversation then turned to a critique of t-shirt designs and slogans, prompting further offensive and absurd calls.  An interview with Charles Ross, a one-man Star Wars show performer, was repeatedly interrupted by offensive and irrelevant calls, ultimately causing Ross to leave due to illness.  The hosts attempted to apologize afterward.


A later segment featured more discussion of Charles Ross and difficult callers, specifically mentioning "Steve in Yellowstone" and "Ben in Boston."  A heated exchange with a caller named Eric resulted in multiple hang-ups.  Steve, a particularly abusive caller, repeatedly insulted Ross with homophobic slurs and offensive language referencing "Ramone." Other callers offered positive feedback to Ross.  The show then included Gavin, a listener who shared a video of a friend engaging in a sexual act at a swingers party in England, providing explicit details and audio clips. The hosts reacted to the graphic content, and the show concluded with further discussion of Ross's performances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Do you think you mentioned some things that might happen? 
[00:04:00]  Some people are really fucking stupid.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  All of it is so bad, it's hard to tell which is the worst.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's.  The worst of Opie and Anthony's.  It's absolutely awful.  We're Steve.  We need the back story on this.  Steve, get in here.  On this audio.  Mom loses it on son.  The video is up on opianthony.com, but you can't really see anything because it's just a video camera that was left. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, the audio, this woman just sounds miserable.  Well, we could start it as Steve makes his way into the studio.  Listen to this lady.  Lady.  Why are you doing this shit?  All I said was ask me.  No, you're not fucking me up, Kalen.  Give me your fucking card so I can use it.  Ask me nicely.  No.  Why can't you ask me nicely?  Stick it up your fucking ass.  I asked you nicely.  10 minutes ago, no, I didn't know. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, you've got to be kidding me.  Steve, what's the story on this?  I guess it's a mother yelling at her son.  He left the camera rolling because he must know that she's prone to these outbursts.  This is great that these kids are just hanging their parents out to dry with these videos and recordings.  We have the one of the son that got picked up by the father, and the father's just yelling at him.  Still one of my favorite things.  Ends up on the Internet.  And now this raging lunatic woman yelling at her son. 
[00:05:30]  I'm going to defend her a little bit.  Why?  Well, you're not allowed to hit your kids anymore.  So what else are you going to do?  Scream like a lunatic?  Would your mom scream like that at you?  She would give you a shoe across the face, and then guess what?  End of discussion.  No, there were a couple of times my mother just would, like, go off like a lunatic like this.  But then she would get so upset, she would bite her hand.  She would go, oh!  She would put her, like, and it was, like, completely straight. 
[00:06:00]  It wasn't like bite your knuckle.  Take your hand and put your fingers together, all together, and just hold it flat.  Okay.  Like, level with the ground.  And now put your index finger in your mouth and just go, oh!  She would do that.  Who's your mother?  Colin Quinn?  Exactly.  Colin.  I've seen Colin do that.  I do that, actually.  I bite the index finger really hard.  No more biting.  And then I bite in between my bicep and my shoulder muscle.  Why?  Right here in that soft spot. 
[00:06:30]  Where do you bite?  Really hard.  Why would you do that?  All right.  Relax.  No, no, I'm asking you.  Jesus.  What?  If you bite between your biceps, that is dangerous.  Why?  You can't.  Because a bicep is...  I didn't say bicep.  Did I?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, I'll be the star of volume three.  Did I really say that one?  No, I didn't even catch that one.  Yeah, you did.  All right.  Bicep.  Of course, Danny Dixon caught it.  Oh, he already marked it down, those motherfuckers. 
[00:07:00]  They're working against us now in that room.  When he flexes like that, though, just when open is showing something, that bicep just comes  out.  All right.  Anyway.  Oh, this is not disturbing outside the studio.  Yeah, who is this guy?  He's a guy that, he came in looking like Crocodile Dundee.  He wants to hand out flyers in Times Square.  I ain't got time to bleed.  We can't get the hot chicks to do it, but we'll get this maniac.  Oh, we got this maniac that is where he printed out something.  Oh, thank you very much.  He's holding it up.  It says, happy birthday.  Jim Norton.  Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hopey and Anthony on the back.  Okay.  Back to the mom losing it on the set. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, right.  So your mom would freak out a little bit, Ant.  Yeah, she would freak out, but yeah, she tried hitting me, but it just didn't work  out, like my father used to hit me, and then when he moved to California, the hitting just  stopped, because she hit me once when I was a little kid, and the strap, the tip of  the strap hit the tip of my penis, and it swelled up, and I had to put ice on it, and  she never hit me with the strap again.  Yeah.  That's terrific. 
[00:08:00]  That's terrific.  Are you serious?  Yeah, I was trying to get out of the way.  Like, I ran to the bunk bed, and I'd always run to the bottom bunk, because it's hard  to swing the strap in there, you know?  But she kind of went to swing it, kind of sidearm to get in there, and the tip of the  strap went right around my waist, and the tip of the strap hit the very tip of my little  wiener.  How do you ice down that area? 
[00:08:30]  I jumped up like a chicken without a head.  I was screaming bloody murder in my room, grabbing, going, and my mother flipped out.  She lost her mind.  She thought she killed me.  Did you feel ashamed?  She threw it, of course, afterwards.  Of course.  And she was like, what did I do?  She freaked out.  And then got some ice and told me to put the ice on it.  So I put ice on it, and that was the last time she ever tried to hit me.  You should have made her put the ice on it.  Yeah, you put the ice on it. 
[00:09:00]  You don't stop my mom from spanking me, because I used to get hit, too.  One time she put me over her knee, she took a paddle, and as she swatted me, I came on  her leg.  Show her.  All right, back to the audio.  And I know I can all fucking tear this room apart and fucking find it.  You'll be one sorry, kid.  I don't have time.  I've got to get back to work.  Do you like one second?  Ask me nicely.  You fucking bastard.  You hear him?  Ask me nicely.  Ask me nicely.  Okay, the kid's being a prick. 
[00:09:30]  Of course, because he knows he's got gold for his friends.  The mother is a witch, though.  And this is why I go back to the, you know, she's not going to hit him.  He knows that.  So now he's like, oh, I'm going to tape this for my friends.  And then he knows what buttons to push.  Yeah, but you know why I can't sympathize with her?  Because you know she uses the same tactic with the husband, boyfriend, whatever it is.  Aren't there references to this?  Aren't there references to, like, child support made in this?  Oh, really?  Okay.  I didn't hear that. 
[00:10:00]  If you look at the footage, you will see, like, an Xbox and TV and a lot of electronics.  And he's obviously got his own camcorder, so he's recording this.  So he might be a relatively, you know, spoiled kid who knows how to push his mom's buttons.  And his mom's...  As soon as I heard this, I said, divorcee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No doubt in my mind.  No doubt.  Todd, I've got to get back to work!  You like one second!  Ask me nicely.  Fucking bastard.  Fucking racist.  Fucking Rosa.  Fucking car. 
[00:10:30]  Give me that goddamn car now!  Who the...  What car is she looking for?  I guess she's looking for a credit card for the gas.  I bet you it's a credit card.  I bet you it's a credit card.  I think she said she ought to get gas to go to work.  And, uh, it's probably a credit card.  So I'll just use cash.  For all you know, it's her credit card.  Could you imagine standing there and having that yelling at you during an argument?  I w...  I...  I'd be...  I'd be in prison.  You'd have to kill that to make it stop.  Fucking house. 
[00:11:00]  Fucking car.  Give me that goddamn car now!  Ask me nicely.  Fuck off, you bastard.  Fuck off!  Get the fuck out of my house!  No, now you're getting on.  Get out of my fucking house!  No, that...  You!  No.  Yeah, you pay the fucking bills.  I can't get my ass to work.  You get out and pay these fucking bills!  Get that ass nicely.  Fuck off!  You're a little fucking headgames, you're a little 16-year-old piece of shit! 
[00:11:30]  You better be fucking out of my house and I'd be home for work today at 11 o'clock.  Because if you're fucking in here, you're getting up and you're getting there.  Fill the back, honey.  I'll call child support and you can go fuck yourself.  You can call your fucking father and we'll live with him.  How about that, you little son of a bitch?  Okay, he said, I'll call child support.  He probably meant child welfare, child services.  Threatening her.  And then call your father, okay, so they don't live together.  Hmm. 
[00:12:00]  There's problems there.  Wow.  You can call your fucking father and we'll be with him.  How about that, you little son of a bitch?  You just turned this whole fucking 15-minute goddamn conversation with all fucking things and shit!  I asked you to ask nicely.  Fuck off!  No.  I asked you nicely when I came in here!  You little jerk-off!  Oh, well.  You little head-game spoil rotten brat!  You're gonna fucking learn about life real fucking quick!  You should learn about life real quick.  Because your fucking bills won't be paid, Mr. Man! 
[00:12:30]  Never mind.  Mr. Man!  Get that fucking card now!  No!  I have to go to work!  No, I don't care now because you were a bitch.  You come here and threaten me out.  You know what?  Forget it.  Get out.  Go away.  You're not getting it now.  You should have asked nicely.  See, this shows our age, I gotta tell you, because I can't even, I can't even imagine.  It's like getting in my mom's face like this.  I can't even, on any level, imagine it.  That's not a mother-son relationship right there.  That's like a...  But I think it shows our age.  I think this is going on a lot more than we realize. 
[00:13:00]  Really?  I think so, man.  I think Ope's right, there's a whole generation of kids that are raised with the concept of  the time-out.  There's no more beatings, there's just, you know, you get a time-out, so you gotta thrash  these little bastards.  I see some of the little kids in my family, and they get a time-out, and you see it in  their eyes like, pfft, whatever.  This is nothing.  Time-out.  Ooh, I'll sit in another room for a little while.  I'm gonna stand on my head.  To make you happy, you know?  And I understand, I'm not questioning parenting, it's what is going on these days, like Steve said.  The threat of the smack, the belt. 
[00:13:30]  Well, you brought up a good point, like when you and Joe would act up, your dad would come  to the bedroom and just, what, leave the belt?  Hang the belt on the doorknob.  First there were threats yelled from the living room, and then if we didn't quiet down and  go to sleep, because we'd be yapping, and they'd hear us, and he'd be like, shut up in there!  Go to sleep!  And you're trying to go to sleep, and then you start talking more, and then he goes, don't  make me get the belt.  And he would take his belt off, and hang it on the doorknob, and yeah, if we were yapping 
[00:14:00]  too much, he'd come in.  He never actually did it, I think that was just the threat.  We got hit with the belt, but it was for like, real stuff, more than just talking.  But the threat of that thing hanging on the doorknob like that, it was just the constant  reminder, like a hangman's noose.  I know.  And we didn't, then we shut up.  We talk about it on the show a lot.  It's the fear.  Yeah.  It's not necessarily something actually happening.  They put the fear in you.  They get the fear in you.  And we knew what that belt felt like, because we had been hit with it.  Exactly.  So just the threat of it was enough to contain us. 
[00:14:30]  But it wasn't an idle threat.  You knew what it felt like to get whacked with that thing.  You know, you ever get shoved down the steps, you ever get knocked, you ever get rattled  a couple times.  If I ever turned around to my mother or father, ever went, hey, fuck you, ask nice, I couldn't  tell you the mess I would have been.  It's got to be a generation thing.  It's got to be.  I can't imagine growing up doing this to my parents.  I would lose an eye.  I would say crap or something as a kid, and my father would just, you know, whoosh. 
[00:15:00]  What?  What's that language?  You don't fucking use that.  You don't fucking use that kind of fucking language in this fucking house, you shithead.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, let's go to Rick in Indiana.  Rick.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Happy birthday there, sweet kid.  You guys got to do it.  Thank you.  Between that bitch on the radio and the South Park chick that drives the school bus, that's  the funniest shit I ever heard.  She's her, man.  Oh, Mrs. Crabtree, right? 
[00:15:30]  You got it.  Do a comparison.  It's her, dude.  Yeah, a bunch of people calling in with that.  Very good.  Excellent.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's going on?  You know, my kid, when I first brought up my kid, we did the timeout thing, and it didn't  work.  He, just like you were saying, he just looked at me.  And then it got to the point where finally I took his notebook and smashed it out of his  hands, literally drop kicked it out of his hands, pushed him up against the wall and 
[00:16:00]  said, that is enough.  He immediately turned into a normal human being and never had a single problem with him since.  Now he's a fabulous, fabulous kid.  Yeah, they're just raising him differently these days.  Yeah, I think it's bullshit.  That's why I hate the left.  Yeah, absolutely.  They treat their kids like their kids are their betters.  And no, no Corey on Instant Feedback. 
[00:16:30]  My mom never threatened to have Joe Klecko hit me.  No, I mean, one good chick and they get in line.  Yeah, idiot.  Everyone knows it was Mookie Wilson.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Joe Klecko.  Jesus.  All right.  Yeah, back to the audio here.  Hang in there, Steve.  Hey, that fucking car.  No.  I have to go to work.  No, I don't care now because you were a bitch.  You come here to threaten me out.  You know what?  Forget it. 
[00:17:00]  Get out.  Go away.  You're not getting it now.  You should have asked nicely.  Oh, you didn't slam it that time.  Well, you had to slam something else.  You're in my fucking house.  You'll follow my fucking role.  You're grounded.  Too late.  Don't fucking go to work.  Don't fucking go to get it.  If you are fucking found in these areas, I'm going to fucking run down there and take your ass out there.  I'm going to work.  Do you not?  No, you're not. 
[00:17:30]  I'm going to go to your goddamn employer and tell you, Galen.  Good for you.  Good for you, you little lazy fucking sass.  You seem to say to you.  Wow.  Anthony, I got a question for you.  You're pretty good at this.  Yeah.  How do you think the marriage ended?  Wow.  Yeah, that was, uh, how would you live with a woman like that?  I don't know.  I mean, I understand the kid is, you know, driven out of this, obviously.  I bet you.  But she's handling this completely wrong.  The kid is probably reacting much in the same way the father reacted. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, probably just, hey, whatever.  No, now I'm not going to do it.  Yeah, this kid probably learned from the master.  I learned it from you, okay.  Whenever mom starts getting like this, just going to, hey, whatever, should I ask nice,  and just let her go off like this, like a lunatic.  She should just be bludgeoning him with something.  Just any weapon in that room.  Beating him with his own PlayStation.  I would take his Little League trophy that he got when he was eight years old. 
[00:18:30]  And just beat him with it.  Just beat the shit out of him.  Just beat him.  She should be smashing his Xbox.  Just smash it in front of his face.  There you go.  That gets results.  You know, the Little League trophy that everyone gets because there's no winners or losers.  No winners or losers.  Everyone's a winner.  Everyone's a winner.  That's great.  Oh, she, oh.  You know, I almost feel sorry for her that she is in this position where she has to be,  has to get herself like this. 
[00:19:00]  She knows she can't.  She knows she can't hit him because if there is a divorce situation,  there's always the threat that this little smartass might call die fest or child services.  Oh, he probably would.  Or the cops.  So she's frustrated that she can't actually discipline because he might call his father  or something like that.  There's all these, there's all these other avenues.  Oh, she's just fucked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's screwed.  Anyway, look at it.  She's just fucked.  She's in a situation that she's got herself into.  She's a raving lunatic, but she's screwed.  And she's screwed.  Yeah.  Don't blame me fucking bastard.  You're a fucking little piece of shit.  You know that?  You know that?  That's exactly what you are. 
[00:19:30]  Go away.  Fucking son of a fucking bitch.  Can't even fucking let me $50 for that.  I'll give her an ass nicely.  I'll give her an ass nicely up your fucking ass, you little spoiled rotten brat.  You're going to like to fucking smack your fucking head in.  You're a goddamn prick.  Thank you for spinning on me.  What the fuck are you doing?  What was she gone?  Are you done yet?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I can't help you, gentlemen.  Shut up.  What a dick.  Shut up.  I kind of like the kid, though.  Oh, would you shut up already?  And it all started with, always and forever.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  The wedding song.  Dreaming of what the future's going to bring.  Oh.  Something nice and sweet and romantic.  We're going to raise a family and have a son.  And I'll raise him.  And he'll be, I want him to be just like you, because I love you.  Always and forever.  Oh, fast forward.  Oh.  Oh.  They never have that in their head when they're dancing. 
[00:21:00]  Here's a brand new bride and groom.  Let's wish him all the best of luck raising that family in the future.  Yeah, here they are smiling.  A little whisper secret in the air.  And everyone at the wedding is, I wonder what they're saying.  Everyone.  You know what they're saying?  I love you.  Everyone with their video cameras getting a good location so they get a good angle of the happy couple.  Oh, going.  Oh.  Oh.  Here comes the ant running on the dance floor real fast to get that shot. 
[00:21:30]  Let me get a picture.  And then running back off the dance floor.  Oh.  And if you look to the back of the room, the DJ is getting all the blow-up instruments ready for the next song.  Oh.  There they go slowly dancing.  Oh, what do I see there?  A box of risky business sunglasses?  Oh, hand them out.  I want the whole wedding party to wear them.  And there's the DJ piling up his records.  Yeah.  I see the chicken dance.  Oh, please.  The electric slide's in there.  The electric slide is ready to go. 
[00:22:00]  It's going to be a fun-filled festive night for everybody.  And, of course, Daddy's Little Girl.  Got to play Daddy's Little Girl.  Meanwhile, Daddy knows what kind of bitch on wheels she is.  He's had to deal with it for years.  He's saying, thank God she's out of my house.  Fast forward a year in the hospital, being handed the little joy.  The bundle of joy.  And there's Little Galen was his name, wasn't he?  I don't remember what it was.  Yeah, it was something like that.  Little Galen. 
[00:22:30]  And then just a mirror.  Got your eyes, honey.  Oh, he's got your nose.  We have so many dreams for him.  Yeah.  Oh, this is going to be great.  He's going to grow up and send him to college.  He's going to be successful.  He's going to do better than I did.  Fast forward a mere 15 years.  Dad is out of the house, and this is what you get.  Why are you doing this shit? 
[00:23:00]  No, you're not fucking me up, Galen.  Give me your fucking card so I can use it.  Yeah.  No.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I asked you nice, like, ten minutes ago.  No, I'm getting real bad.  And I know I can all fucking care.  This room apart and fucking find it.  You'll be one sorry again.  I know that's fine.  I've got to get back to work.  Everybody.  One second.  Always and forever.  Let's get the entire wedding party out on the floor and join our bride. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yes.  Get your goddamn card now.  Dance with a lovely couple.  Fuck off, you bastard.  Fuck off.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Get out of my fucking house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You pay the fucking bills.  Oops.  Looks like it's not always and forever.  Aw.  Baby fucking bill.  That ass nicely.  Fuck off.  You're all fucking headgank.  You're all 16.  You're all a piece of shit. 
[00:24:00]  It's over, Janet.  You're all fucking fucking out of my house.  And I hope for work today at 11 o'clock.  Because if you're fucking in here, you're getting out and you're getting there fucking at night.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  You can call your fucking father a little bit with him.  How about that, you little son of a bitch.  You just turned this whole fucking 15 minutes on this conversation and he'll fucking fix this thing.  Stop whining.  Fuck off.  Stop whining.  You nice and nice came in here.  Quiet.  You little jerk off.  I'm scared of you. 
[00:24:30]  You're a little headgank.  Spoiled right brat.  I'm scared.  You're gonna fucking learn about life real fucking quick.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I protect myself.  Get that fucking card now.  I have to go to work.  I don't care now because you're a bitch.  You come here and threaten me out.  You know what?  Forget it.  Get out.  Go away.  Did she ever think her little baby boy would be calling her a fucking bitch?  Right.  As she was holding him in the hospital with little blue blankie. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  You had to slam something else.  Oh, here comes his first words, honey.  You're my fucking house.  You'll follow my fucking roll.  You're crying.  His first words were mama.  You're a fucking man and dad.  Dad, dad.  You're a fucking found in these areas.  I'm gonna fucking run down there and take your ass out there.  I'm going to work.  Do you not?  No, you're not.  I'm not even trying to.  I'm going to go to your goddamn employer and tell you this, Galen.  Good for you.  Good for you, you little lazy fucking sass.  You're a fucking little piece of shit, you know that? 
[00:25:30]  Always and forever.  Go away.  Yeah, you son of a fucking bitch.  God, you're a fucking bitch.  Let me get the other crap out of you.  Fucking ask nicely up to your fucking ass, you little spoiled rotten brat.  What happened?  You're a goddamn prick.  I was just rocking you to sleep.  It seems like I can't see you.  What the fuck are you doing?  What happened?  Are you done yet? 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  I don't know, it echoes.  Sounds like the hallways of an insane asylum.  Shut up.  Shut up.  That's right.  There you go.  Shut up.  On Christmas morning when he was a kid and all starry-eyed, unwrapping his first bicycle. 
[00:26:30]  And now, shut up.  God, I love that.  That is great.  We should almost play the father one now.  Oh, that's fantastic.  You guys have to take this audio and clean it up for TV.  Not a bad idea.  Susan Smith had the right idea.  Get rid of the little fuckers.  That's from Cringe Box.  Very nice.  Oh, wait.  There's actually more to that clip where the neighbor has to come over. 
[00:27:00]  Danny?  Oh, Danny.  Yeah, because it's really long, so I just kind of wanted to give you guys the meat of it.  But she goes on, you know, off mic where you kind of just hear her through the walls for probably about another two and a half minutes.  Wow.  And then you hear a neighbor come by, and he has to kind of convince the son to just relax.  Just, you know, give your mom the money.  She just has to go to work and get gas.  That's the kind of screaming that does carry two or three houses down.  Can you hear the, did the neighbor go in the room?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  You can hear him.  We got to hear him.  I'll get the rest of it.  Yeah, we can't leave the fine listeners just hanging.  There's a part two to that, Anthony.  Nice.  And we really should try to clean that up for TV.  Not a bad idea at all.  Wonderful.  Let's see.  Dad beat him with wiffle ball.  Irony.  She called him son of a bitch.  I agree.  Yeah, he agreed with it.  Let's see.  Wow.  Listen to this.  Schwuggy.  Hey, Schwuggy.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[00:28:00]  Pretty good, Schwuggy.  Good morning, Pumpkin Tits.  Anthony, you're talking about hitting your father or being scared of him.  I remember when I was 12 and my father was just smacking me around for something I fucked up.  And I was a man.  I said, screw it.  I smacked him.  Uh-oh.  To this day, I can still remember the fire in his eyes and me just running to my room and just barricading the door.  But that's when everything changes, though, right?  Not at 12.  No, not at 12.  Oh, not at 12.  Okay.  But what was worse was he left.  It was one of those things where he held a grudge and just remembered until the next time I fucked up. 
[00:28:30]  I know it sucks.  You're 12.  It's not like you can pack your little stuff and throw it on the end of a stick and go run away somewhere.  Well, you know what's really funny?  Sometimes the balance shifts.  Because I remember I was about 20 or 21, and I was in tip-top physical shape at the time, working out twice a day.  And I remember just mouthing both of my father or something like that.  He's like, I can still knock you on your ass.  And my father was like 62, 100 pounds overweight.  Oh, knock you on your ass, kid. 
[00:29:00]  Exactly, exactly.  But when it gets to that point, it's just damn depressing.  No, you're right.  Well, there's a whole thing that goes on.  When you reach the point where you are old enough and strong enough to take your dad, you should be on terms with him where you would never think of doing that.  Oh, no.  I remember him saying that to me and me just saying, come on, let's go, jokingly.  Yeah.  And my mom's like, yeah, I want to see this, too.  You know, of course not.  But it's just sad because we'll all be at that spot at one point.  Well, not you guys, but I will be.  So it's amazing.  I have two little girls and who I do slap on the tushy every once in a while. 
[00:29:30]  And they just don't care.  I mean, it's just amazing.  Every time you hit him, they're closer to the pole.  Closer to putting that, wrapping the leg around the pole and doing circles around it.  I don't care.  All right, punch down.  And they develop that smack move.  Yeah, they do the smack.  They smack themselves.  And they remember when they were a kid.  When I was a kid, I remember stealing quarters from my father.  Stealing quarters from his bedroom.  Buy something.  I don't even remember what the hell it was. 
[00:30:00]  But he found out and, ooh, that wasn't good.  I got wrapped right across the face, open hand, big man mitt, whacked right across my face.  There's a few things that happen.  And you know something?  Again, I never took the quarters again.  That was it.  But there's a few things that happen.  You do get to an age, if you're in that situation where you do get hit or whatever,  and you finally stand up to the person, your parents, and then it's never the same after that.  And that's kind of sad because then you realize that you sort of have the upper hand. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  It's kind of weird when you're a kid and you've got parents.  And then the other thing is, like, it brings back a weird memory for me.  When you're a kid, you're always competing with your father in a way.  You know, name it.  Like, in my house, it was basketball, right?  And my dad would play me because I was into playing basketball and stuff.  And we'd have, like, foul shooting contests and stuff.  It was, you know, a dad and son thing to do, you know.  You're going to squirt?  And I'd be struggling. 
[00:31:00]  And let's say I'd make, I don't know, six out of ten free throws, let's say.  And then it's dad's turn.  And then, you know, he makes, like, you know, five.  He's five for eight, let's say.  And then as a kid, you know, it starts where you don't realize that he's allowing you to win.  You know, so, you know, he misses, obviously, the last two, and he gets five out of ten, and you win.  Yeah.  And then it gets to a point where then you notice that he's purposely letting you win, right?  Right.  And that starts to be a bummer. 
[00:31:30]  And then it gets to the stage where there's no letting the son win anymore.  Now the father's trying his balls off to still beat you.  To beat you, yeah, yeah.  And then you know that you're now officially, quote, better than him as far as that little thing goes.  Right.  A little competition.  And when that happens, it's kind of a drag, too.  You're like, oh, that kind of sucks.  I remember something like that, too, because I was able.  Shooting or something, right?  No, it was, you know, I wasn't able to drink a case of beer.  But then as I got older, I was able to drink more than my father. 
[00:32:00]  You're not even making a joke.  Sometimes I'd spot him a few beers.  You never know with you, though.  There was drinking and effing and horse riding going on.  Jesus.  Yeah.  You weren't being raised at all when you were in California.  No, it was like camp.  But it's kind of a weird thing when you're growing up when it finally hits that level where now you realize that you've sort of got the upper hand on your parents.  Yeah.  You know, no matter what it is, it's just a little strange.  Toolbag is saying, never underestimate old man strength, though. 
[00:32:30]  It's the only thing that comes close to retard strength.  Like your father's strength.  He'll give it his all if he feels you're going to get the upper hand.  Yeah.  I never appreciated that whole, you know, fighting your father thing.  Nah, nah, nah.  It's a little odd.  That is beyond odd.  I never spoke to either one of my parents this way.  I would have woken up to Christmas music.  Bushkill Jim. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the whole thing, talking back to your parents like that.  No way.  Would have been over.  All right.  Let me see what Jackson has in Florida.  Are you in Jacksonville?  No, I'm Jackson.  My name is Jackson.  I live in Florida.  Ah.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  What's up?  Yeah.  My ex-wife is in the same situation as this lady was.  She doesn't scream like that.  We still get along real good, but my 14-year-old tried that, talking back, getting really nasty 
[00:33:30]  with her, called her a bitch, wouldn't let her, wouldn't let her, she wouldn't let him  spend the night at a friend's house because, you know, he'd gotten two Fs on his report  card, all this stuff.  So she called me up.  What do I do?  I said, let him go.  And, uh, she's like, you know, what are you talking about?  I said, just let him go.  Trust me on this.  Let him go.  So she, and I said, we're going to, we're going to fix his little red wagon while he's  gone.  And after he was gone for the weekend, I went over there.  We moved all his Xbox, PlayStation, television, everything out of his room, literally cleaned  it out empty. 
[00:34:00]  Ripped the carpet off the floors down to the concrete.  I bought a cot and put a cot in there with a pillow and took the door off the hinges.  And that's what he came home to.  And the thing that upset him the most was the fact that the door was off the hinges.  So now he has no privacy whatsoever.  Zero privacy and no possessions.  We took all of his clothes, went to Walmart and bought Dickie's pants and white button down  shirts and said, there, deal with that, you little bastard.  And he, we made him live like that for a month and have never had a problem with him since. 
[00:34:30]  Wow.  You're a sick one, man.  That's nice.  But it worked.  It worked.  You can't beat him.  I mean, if it was up to me, I'd have to put my boot in his ass, but you can't do it.  Right.  Now they will call them cops.  It's happened to friends of mine.  Right.  Wow.  You know, I had a good friend of mine, nice guy, great guy, goes to my church, Christian  guy, and he ended up locked up overnight for beating his kid.  Wow.  So, and that's, so that's what I decided to do.  And to take the door off the hinges, it killed him. 
[00:35:00]  He couldn't go in his room.  Yeah, that's their privacy.  Slam the door and.  Gone.  Very good, sir.  In their own domain.  A lot of people asking if this kid in the audio is a stepchild.  No way.  No way, right?  No, it doesn't sound like it.  Let's say hi to James in Oklahoma.  James?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Morning to you.  And someone else is bringing up a point on the instant feedback and the phones now.  The mother wants to borrow his money in that clip.  Yeah.  I didn't pick up on that. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, that is odd.  James, go ahead.  Well, I had a stepmother that was just like that, but I never talked to her that way because  I knew what was coming.  So 20 years later, I become a cop here in Oklahoma, and I go to these little kids' houses that  are acting like this.  What do I do?  I tell the parents, I say, spank them.  They take their belt off, and I'll stand there and watch them spank their child.  That way, they can't come up with this, hey, I'm calling Child Protective Services. 
[00:36:00]  I'm calling the cops.  The cops are here.  And I tell the parents, hey, if you're going to spank your child, you spank your child.  Get it over with right now, and maybe you won't have these problems later on in life.  I tell them, hey, if you need some help, I will hold them down.  That doesn't sound silly.  You're setting yourself up for a lawsuit, sir, unfortunately.  No, no lawsuit, because I'm not doing anything wrong.  I'm making sure they're obeying the law and disciplining their child, and it's not child  abuse.  Right. 
[00:36:30]  Wow.  Okay.  Thank you, James.  Hey, thanks, guys.  There he goes.  James in Oklahoma.  We have the other audio.  Do you have that?  I think everybody's different.  All kids are different.  So if some of them, you can do that whole sit down, take a timeout thing.  That's fine.  But I think if the timeout thing isn't working, and you could probably see that pretty early  on, then you've got to resort to plan B. It would be nice to be the person that, like,  oh, I don't have to hit my kids, or I don't hit my kids, or something like that. 
[00:37:00]  But, you know, and I'm talking to my ass because I don't have kids.  But it just seems to me like if the timeout thing isn't working and you're raising a little  terror, it might be time to get a little thing.  Because it's more about the whole fear of it than it is the actual pain from getting whack.  You're not hitting them so they're in pain.  It's just kind of a, you know, wake-er-upper.  It's like a surprise.  Yeah, because...  You're fucking hitting me?  Who wants to go through that?  Yeah.  Except a little Jimmy Norton, of course.  We've got some audio of the Boston Father.  We've played this... 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, we've played it once or...  Well, maybe on the replay you've heard it a couple times.  And Danny's running in with part two of the audio of this chick.  Oh!  Well, we can save the Boston Father audio then.  Here's part two of the lady yelling at her son, looking for just money, I guess.  You're here!  You're in my fucking house and I want to fucking stop!  Ow!  Shouldn't have asked nicely.  Oh, wow.  Sit here, call me all this shit, and you expect me to help you? 
[00:38:00]  Why in the hell should I help you after all you just did?  You're not struggling!  No, I'm not going to help you.  I'm not going to help you.  I'm not going to help you.  I'm not going to help you.  Oh, she was losing her mind.  And you can't ask me nicely.  You have to sit here and call me names.  Lend your mom 50 bucks.  Why? 
[00:38:30]  Because she's broke, Dale.  Oh, okay, so now here's the neighbor, like Danny explained.  Danny, uh, the neighbor comes in to try to get this kid to lend the mom 50 bucks.  Fitty.  Where's this kid getting the money from?  Maybe dad?  Yeah.  All right, here comes the neighbor.  Call me names.  Lend your mom 50 bucks.  Why?  Because she's broke, Dale.  She's being a complete bitch.  Because she's broke.  But she's being a bitch.  Look at this.  Do you want to live here?  Do you want to live here? 
[00:39:00]  No, I'm not going to live in here soon.  But that is complete bullshit.  You don't treat somebody like that and expect to get them to help you.  The whole point is, Dale, is your mom's got to get to work.  And she's asking you to lend her 50 bucks.  If you can't do it, then, you know, she's been here fucking supporting you guys for over fucking 16 years.  Another scenario.  You move into the neighborhood and you meet the old neighbor.  Hey, neighbor.  Hey.  Howdy, neighbor. 
[00:39:30]  Maybe you invite him over to a barbecue or something.  Yeah.  Now he's in the middle of this crap.  Now he's got to deal with this.  Started with a warm apple pie.  Now you're talking to her son.  Oh, after hearing her screeching all morning.  Fucking supporting you guys for over fucking 16 years.  Yeah.  She's been caring about you guys for 16 years.  Like, what the hell is that?  You've got to understand one thing.  That's not how you treat your children.  She's been treating you better than you've ever been treated in your entire lifetime.  No, no, she hasn't. 
[00:40:00]  You've got to understand this fucking, you know, this isn't easy for her.  This is very fucking difficult.  And this is acceptable?  You guys aren't helping.  This is not acceptable under any standards ever.  That's not the point, Dale.  Just help your mom.  Help my mom so she can act like this, so we can live in a house.  And if you're helping her mom, she wouldn't be acting like this.  She acts like this no matter what.  Okay, that's the way it is.  Because you guys don't help out around the house.  Even when we do help, and she is guys. 
[00:40:30]  You guys got to wake up, man.  This is the real world.  She needs to wake up a bit, too.  It's not teachers and cream out there.  Well, she doesn't get to treat people like that and expect them to help her.  Help her out.  Please.  She sits here and swears at me.  I hate everything about you.  What the hell is that?  I'm asking you nicely, and I'm asking you to fucking please help her out.  I'll pay you back.  I don't give a shit.  Just fucking please help her out.  Okay, I will.  As long as I get my $50.  Yeah.  Yeah, you'll get it back.  Okay. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, looks like it's going to be okay, Anthony.  Looks like it's going to be okay.  Thanks to the neighbor.  Why is there a minute 40 left in this audio?  Here we go.  Yeah.  Mom, do you want the $50?  Shut up, Mom.  Do you want the $50?  Sure, sir.  I'll just do it.  Big people fucking say you're a fucking love-selling crap.  And I hate you.  Shh.  Why? 
[00:41:30]  I hate you.  There's not more fucking else in me.  You're fine.  You're fine.  Yes, thank God there's not more else in me in your body.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You're a fucking loser.  Shh.  You're going to fucking hell and shut yourself down from the factory.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Fucking crazy fucking war.  You picked the wrong person.  I'm fucking war.  Curse it and butter your fucking bread, you little waste of ass.  You don't butter my bread?  Are you retarded?  You're going to get fucking me out. 
[00:42:00]  Or what?  Or fucking the police will be coming.  And what are you going to say to them, Mom?  You fucking out of my house.  What are you going to say to them, Mom?  You want me out?  Yeah, Mom.  Good luck.  Good luck with that.  You didn't want me out?  Good luck with that, Mom.  That's for fucking kids.  I'll call them for you.  I will.  You go ahead and call them for you.  You're out.  Kids know too much these days.  Nothing like making your fucking mother pay for fucking money. 
[00:42:30]  I wasn't.  I said ask nicely.  Okay.  Get out of here.  This way.  This way.  I can't believe I came home from a fucking ship to fucking do this fucking bullshit.  And cut.  But she wasn't done, neither.  That's for sure.  I think that's when the video camera went off, huh?  Wow, man.  No, there's more?  That's it, right? 
[00:43:00]  That's it.  That's all there is.  Okay.  Wow.  I, uh...  Hmm.  He just knows too much.  She's going, I'll call the cops.  And he's like, yeah, good luck with that.  She calls the cops.  The kid goes, look, I'm 16.  My mother's insane.  She's yelling at me for things I'm trying to do, you know.  She's kicking me out of the house?  The kid is 16?  The kid's definitely an instigator, but I'm starting to think that she might have more  of a problem than the kid, actually.  Yeah, she's got a huge problem.  The kid probably reminds her too much of the husband, is what it is, who she hates for 
[00:43:30]  probably leaving her.  And every time she looks at the kid, she sees the ex-husband.  You can hear it in his voice.  Yeah.  He's kind of like a beaten kid.  Yeah, he's just like...  You know, he's a wise-ass, obviously.  He was...  Eh.  But you also hear it in his voice, like, this really is a bummer.  She really...  This just thinks my mother's insane.  That's an unhealthy relationship they have there.  I think they need help.  Wow.  All right, let's say hi to Stephen Califoran.  That's really going to also help him out in his relationships in the future, I believe. 
[00:44:00]  You know what it's going to be like when he's out there looking for a girlfriend, future  wife, perhaps?  Steve?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, out in California, you know how liberal they are.  I have daughters in an ex-situation, and when I got custody, I asked the child support  worker and my caseworker and custody worker, because I put them in a system to where they 
[00:44:30]  come out to my house and visit so my ex-wife can't say I abused my children, what the definition  of abusing your child was.  And they said as long as you can hate your child open-handed, by law, two or three times,  and as long as you don't go, more than that, it's not considered abuse.  That's a little weird, huh?  That's California.  So you figure if California is a liberal state that way, how are other states seeing it?  That's all I got, punch it out.  All right, thank you. 
[00:45:00]  Let's go to Timmy in Wisconsin.  Timmy!  Hey, man.  What's up?  My mother would scream exactly like that.  Oh, you're kidding.  She would actually put a butcher knife to her throat and say, I'll do it.  I'll fucking do it.  Are you kidding me?  Her own throat.  She would lock herself in the bathroom, screaming from the bathroom, I'll do it, and she'd be  slashing furniture with it.  Wow, that's really crazy.  I kept the knife for like over a year with like dents all in it, and then it happened  again like a year later, and I brought it out, and my dad grabbed it from me. 
[00:45:30]  He's like, this shouldn't be around here.  He's afraid like the wrong person would see it, and Mommy would be put away in a straitjacket.  What does she do now?  She's at home, watches TV.  Yeah?  Do you have a relationship with her?  Yeah, well, it was mostly because like my dad was drinking, and when my dad quit drinking,  then she got really bad.  Yeah.  But then after like a year, it calmed down, and she's pretty cool now.  You goof on her about it? 
[00:46:00]  Well, no, not now.  I mean...  Because we goof on my mother all the time about how she used to be crazy.  We kind of told her some of the last dinner, though.  Yeah.  She was insane with cleaning the house.  We would wake up Saturday mornings, and my mother would be like, it didn't matter.  You know, I guess we're 12, something like that.  Who even knows?  But she'd wake us up.  Come on, get up!  This place looks like a fucking bomb hit it.  Get...  And, you know, meanwhile, I'm just thinking, you know, a few years later, I start thinking,  oh, I get it.  Clean the house.  Make sure it's clean. 
[00:46:30]  You know, there's some issues there, Mommy.  Well, you're not alone with that one, though.  Yeah.  I think a lot of people could relate to that one.  But we were all like, you know, you know, this one's dusting, this one's vacuuming the  house, and she was just, you know, get under it.  What is this?  Pick that up.  Just crazy.  And then the phone would ring, and she'd pick it up and be like, and don't, make sure you  get under the couch.  How the hell are you?  Hot, yeah.  Oh, nothing.  We're just sitting around.  So we would clean up so quickly while she was on the phone. 
[00:47:00]  So then we could walk up to her as she's on the phone and go, I'm going to go outside.  I'm going to go outside.  And she would kind of do that, not even look at you, but wave the hand like, okay, all  right, right.  And then you were out of the house.  When that phone rang, we would, because we'd be going nuts.  We'd be, you'd be with all your cleaning tools, and the phone would ring, and I cannot tell  you the relief that would come over three kids just from a phone ringing, because you  knew you weren't being yelled at as you're cleaning up.  She was crazy.  But now, you know, we're sitting around, and she's a pisser now.  And we'd just sit around and goof on her about it, about how crazy she was, and what the 
[00:47:30]  hell was your problem?  She was raising you animals by herself.  Pat in Boston, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That lady needs Scientology and not Paxil.  Scientology.  Good call back, bro.  Very good, Pat.  That's a great call.  Tony in the Bronx.  What's up, Tony?  Yo, guys.  You got to see what it was like growing up when a wise guy is a father.  Oh, really?  I'm talking about when I was a kid, I used to go make the Sherlock elections with him,  and I used to watch my father give guys beatings, and for as long as he was alive, he'd never 
[00:48:00]  lay the finger on me.  I never gave an opportunity to.  But my mother, she was the executioner.  But having the wise guy in the family, that was a trip.  Yeah, you got to be really.  That's always in the back of your head, I got to imagine.  I'm going to miss you being on the phone with you guys right now.  He's gone, but if his friends recognize my voice, I'd get to talk to him for this.  Really?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Where do you live in the Bronx?  I mean, yeah, I'm telling you. 
[00:48:30]  What's your last name, Tony?  He was pretty notorious.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Okay, Doc.  Take care.  Oh, can we play guess the wise guy?  All right.  Tough guy.  All right.  I wish you'd move on, huh?  Sure.  That was very entertaining.  One more.  Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Hey, boys.  Hey, the guy that called earlier was saying about stripping his kid's room.  I can top that.  My best friend and former neighbor, he had a 14-year-old that did the same shit.  He wanted to go camping with some friends. 
[00:49:00]  And they let him go after like three or four days of arguing.  When the kid came home, the house was completely empty.  His parents had a rental property.  They moved everything out of the house except for his belongings that they left in his room.  They moved into the rental house and they left a note that said, now, you take care  of everything.  He just, and they were my next-door neighbors at the time.  And, you know, so the kid comes home.  The friends drop him off.  He walks up, unlocks. 
[00:49:30]  The door walks in.  There is nothing.  You've got to think that starts off as being the greatest day of your life.  But by 11 o'clock at night, you've got to be freaked beyond belief.  Well, yeah, because he kept trying to call his parents on their cell phone and they wouldn't  answer or anything.  He came over and asked me, he said, do you know where my parents are?  And I said, dude, I said, Saturday, they were like here with a moving truck leaving.  Because I knew what had happened.  So, you know what?  He called Child Services and actually the caseworker that came out, I mean, that poor 
[00:50:00]  woman laughed for like 20 minutes when she found out what had happened.  Yeah, you've got to imagine they have some great stories, those people.  So what happened?  What happened in the end with this?  They ended up, I mean, they moved everything back.  Because all they did was just put everything in the garage or the rental.  They didn't unpack everything.  But, like, they came back the next day.  And, I mean, that kid has just been on his best behavior ever since.  Because his parents told him.  They said, you know what?  They said, what would you have done if we wouldn't have even left you any forwarding  information?  I will. 
[00:50:30]  You won't flip him out Wednesday.  You know, you've been seriously screwed.  I'm sure that kid behaved after that, huh?  Oh, yeah.  This has been a couple of years.  I guess you've just got to be creative out there if you're parents, huh?  Yeah.  You know, the hitting is out of the game.  So you've got to get a little more creative.  More than just time outs.  This is why I don't have kids.  It really is, man.  When I hear shit like this, people say, why don't you and your wife have kids?  You know, look at society, man.  Look at these kids today.  To all the new parents out there, just remember this later today when you're by yourself, away 
[00:51:00]  from the radio show.  Always and forever.  Always starts like that.  Ah.  Rob from Washington.  Oh, my God.  My mom was a super cleaner, too.  Never thought of it until you mentioned it.  Maybe there's something else there.  Oh, that is the one I need.  I need Ted.  My mother would scream like a harpy like that and insult my brother, sister, and myself.  She would always use the maybe I'll just die and you'll be happy routine. 
[00:51:30]  The insults and shrieking just brought back wonderful memories.  And then Chris from Bridgeport.  The best quote from my mother was when she was ripping pissed one day.  She said, I'm going to kick you so hard in the balls, they're going to end up in the  roof of your mouth.  Wow.  Moms can be pretty creative with their language.  Oh, yeah.  My mom was always with the racial slurs.  A lot of racial slurs growing up.  She called you the N-word?  No, she used it a lot, though.  She would use it as far as cleaning would go. 
[00:52:00]  The house looks like a bunch of live here.  What do I look three shades darker than you is always a good one.  Clean up.  Oh, can you get it?  What do I look three shades darker than you?  Clean up.  Wow.  She was the worst.  Well, that explains a lot of things.  She's changed.  That explains a lot of things.  She got older and wiser.  About her son.  About her son.  Bob in Minnesota.  Yeah, we used to have to tackle my ex-girlfriend's mother because she'd walk around the house 
[00:52:30]  punching the windows out in the house.  We'd have to tackle the floor and stop her.  You tackled your ex-girl's mom?  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah.  Her arms would be all cut up and shit from punching through the windows.  Hey, I also got a Ben Fogg joke.  Ben Fogg is so big that they're like to fly planes into it.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in Philly.  Yeah.  What's up?  I got to say, maybe your mom, you know, being the whole clean freak she is, is what made 
[00:53:00]  you freak out and, you know, get rid of your couch when it had a booger on it and everything  else under the sun.  Nah, because I'm a lazy bastard.  I won't care if things are cluttered.  Like, it wasn't dirty stuff.  It was just clutter stuff.  Like, if we had our magazines laying around or, you know, there was like a little bit of  dust on the old stereo cabinet or something, that was a problem.  Me, I could give a shit.  Things like that.  It doesn't bother me.  Okay.  But my mother was insane when it came to that stuff.  With the Windex and the Lemon Pledge and the vacuum going. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  My mom was ridiculous when it came to that stuff.  To the point, we all just went the other way and we're all slobs.  Yeah.  See?  That's what happens.  Good job.  I mean, yeah.  It freaks me out if things are too organized.  Sweeping the brooms and the shovel and the dustpan and the friggin' vacuum.  You're watching TV and that vacuum comes a-calling.  No, it was always us vacuuming.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it started with mom and her old blue bathrobe just banging into your legs.  On the 70s, we had some great vacuums, too. 
[00:54:00]  Boy, those things are nice, convenient.  I mean, they weighed 12 tons, had different parts.  They were supposed to be convenient on wheels.  I mean, we had this canister vacuum that when you pulled it, it just tipped over.  It was a big hose with the thing at the end.  And then somehow.  And it was attached to a canister that was supposed to.  When you first got it on, like, Christmas or something,  when dad would get mom the vacuum for Mother's Day,  it was on wheels and it rolled for, like, a month.  And then once one of the wheels froze up because the carpet fibers would get in there, 
[00:54:30]  you'd go to pull it and it'd tip over and go,  and then it'd make, like, a whining sound because it was clogged and dusted,  start shooting out of it.  And the dirt would shoot out.  Pick that up!  That's why I hate vacuums to this day.  It's not even a bit.  Because my mom vacuumed every day, easily every day.  Yeah.  More than once a day, too.  It was constant.  You know how?

Family and I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The worst of O.B. and Anthony.  I know.  And we got, you want to say hi to Mudvayne?  Certainly.  They seem pretty bored out there.  Oh, yeah?  They're doing the Ozzy, they're doing the Ozfest thing.  Yes.  That's a great gig to be on, man.  Phenomenal.  We got Chad. 
[00:57:30]  I think we got the whole band.  You know, you're going to have big crowds.  Chad, Greg, Ryan, Matt, right?  We got the whole gang today, Chad.  As I'm yelling through the door as these guys are coming through.  They're on their cell phones.  What's up, yo?  How you doing?  Gentlemen.  Do we actually need these?  Nah.  Nah.  Wow, you look really serious.  You don't want to hear the callers.  Are we doing callers?  Is that what we do?  Sometimes.  We don't have to do anything.  Well, let's fucking get some hoaxes. 
[00:58:00]  It's glowing here.  What's going on?  What's going on?  You look very serious.  You all right?  You just woke up?  I play in a rock band.  Are you annoyed?  I was supposed to have gone to bed an hour ago.  Yeah.  You don't know the rock and roll lifestyle, Opie.  It's about sleeping late, staying out late, and early shit like this just kind of annoys you, right?  Yeah.  You go back to the, you know, up all night, sleep all day.  The morning voice you got going. 
[00:58:30]  Absolutely.  Was it like an hour last night?  I'm a comic.  I deal with the same shit.  It's fucking, you're up at like three o'clock in the morning, you get an hour of sleep.  I think about, uh, 30 minutes.  Yeah, that's pretty hot.  Damn.  Where are you guys coming from?  I don't know.  No clue.  Where were we from?  D.C.  Oh, no.  It wasn't called D.C., though.  That's right.  Bristol something.  Bristol.  Yeah.  Bristol.  Do you really lose track when you're on the road, what city you're in after a while?  I don't know what day it is.  Absolutely.  I have no idea what day it is.  You're just kind of on the rail, there it is.  Could be Saturday.  Get through with the, uh, the shows. 
[00:59:00]  Some people say rock and roll, some people say retarded.  Yeah?  That's me.  Do you guys hate being on the road or what?  Love it.  Absolutely hate it.  Love it.  I love it.  Do you really?  Oh, that's a curse.  I mean, what's your dream?  You guys get so big you don't have to tour anymore?  Like, no, I mean, I'm serious.  I mean, there are guys that, you know, that ain't happening anytime soon.  Well, but, but if you hate it, you know, why do it?  I said I love it.  Yeah, he loves it.  Sometimes things are just a little bit bigger than you are. 
[00:59:30]  Really?  Yeah.  The whole thing kind of grew a little?  Yeah.  Well, like, were you just, were you happier just kind of kicking it in clubs and?  Basements.  Shit like that.  Basements, really?  Basements, obvious.  Doesn't every band, though, get together with the final goal, the dream of doing what  you're doing?  Being on a huge tour?  And, you know, that seems to be what you get together for when you're younger.  Absolutely.  Younger.  Younger.  And then you finally get, uh.  And you get there and you're, brilliant. 
[01:00:00]  And then you get there and you're like, fuck.  Yeah, you realize you had to sell your soul to Beelzebub.  And, you know.  Yeah, you have your idea of what it's going to all be about.  And then, yeah, you have to sign a few contracts with some businessmen.  Things you never wanted to do.  Totally.  Well, you guys are going on, like, right, you're on the main stage.  You're going on right before Maiden and Sabbath.  I mean, that's got to be phenomenal as a band to be working with those two bands.  Absolutely.  Did you get a picture with Sabbath?  No.  No.  I'm such a fucking stalker.  I get photos of everybody.  Jimmy's all about the celebrity photos.  I fucking.  Do they get a photo together? 
[01:00:30]  Are they ever together at any other point other than the family?  In Sabbath Village, maybe, you'll see them.  In that little area where the trailers are?  Oh, I have done that.  No.  I stared at Bill Ward for 45 minutes until he fucking finally took a picture with me.  He was just warming up on his drums, and I just sat there and stared at him.  Wait, those guys don't want to be together at all?  You think that?  I didn't say that.  I just.  You just haven't seen them together.  I would, you know, I think it would be easy to presume that they probably don't get together  at any other time than being on stage.  Just on stage and then.  Bill's really cool. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, he's great.  He's super approachable.  Just a cool guy.  Hangs out.  He's up on the deck during the day.  Just tweaking on his drums, saying hey to everybody.  I annoyed Geezer and Iommi.  Fucking kind of stalking him outside the tour bus.  And I think I scared Geezer back onto the bus.  That kind of does annoy people, yeah.  I can't help it.  I didn't really stalk him.  I just kind of stood there, but fuck him.  What were we talking about?  We were talking about why I hate touring?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, that'll do it, huh?  What, the stalkers?  Well, I mean, I'm sure that's one reason to.  Fans, stalkers. 
[01:01:30]  What, do they annoy the shit out of you, though?  Always asking for something?  Pictures, autographs.  That's kind of big.  I guess, you know what, if they'd ask, that might be all right.  But, you know, people running up to you and sticking a camera in your face, you know.  Really?  Yeah, totally.  Yeah, it sucks.  Oh, yeah, totally.  But that's kind of, and they would say, that's kind of, hey, you know, you wanted to, this  lifestyle of the rock star kind of thing is kind of the position you put yourself in.  You're going to have to deal with it.  Hmm.  No, huh?  Yeah.  You don't see it that way?  No.  Well, how do you see it, then? 
[01:02:00]  I play drums.  Yeah.  That's all I do.  That's all I ever signed up for, playing drums.  And the rest of this stuff just annoys the hell out of you.  Well, just, you know, he didn't say on the resume, be a professional model, you know.  Right.  Also.  Yeah.  Didn't see that one coming.  Would you rather work for a living?  What's that?  Would you rather work for a living, like a real job?  I am working for a living.  Come on.  No, I know.  I know.  Like, I got to come in and go to work every morning.  But believe me, I worked at some point in my life, you know. 
[01:02:30]  I actually was in construction for a while.  I ran my own custodial business.  See?  That's what I mean by working for a living.  Obviously, you work hard playing and, you know, doing what you do.  We keep crazy hours, absolutely.  But would you rather be...  Or video shoots, right?  Absolutely.  Would you rather be installing, you know, drywall or something?  You know, you wouldn't have anybody bothering you.  He's done it.  Yeah.  I've done it, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't...  It's...  That...  No, I'm thinking once this rock star thing is done, I'm going to go back to school and 
[01:03:00]  get an art history degree.  Really?  Absolutely.  I'm working in a museum.  That's it.  That's it.  I'm a curator.  I don't mean to laugh.  No.  I'm going to go back to the drywall.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Back to the drywall.  I want to be a tour guide.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  Maybe at the Wadsworth Thothenium in Hartsworth, Connecticut.  That would be hot because you're such a people person.  I am.  I am.  But you know what?  Yeah, you're really coming...  But you know what?  No, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  If you're taking somebody on a museum tour, you don't really have to be nice to anybody.  All you have to do is walk around and tell the people what they're looking at. 
[01:03:30]  Hey.  The people that work in museum...  You know, that's P.A. Mondrian over there.  They're assholes.  It was done in 1931.  Just hope nobody wants to...  Right when he went into his boogie-woogie phase.  Just hope that no one wants to take your picture in front of the Chuck Close.  Why would anybody want to take my picture if I'm a museum tour guy?  You know, just so they know who would care.  So they can show the power of the photorealism.  Oh.  Well, I would be game for that, you know.  There's still got to be something phenomenal.  This is the difference between comics and rock people. 
[01:04:00]  So it's just got to be...  To get blown on a bus has got to be the fucking greatest thing ever.  Blow what?  To get blown on a bus?  Never have I been blown on a bus.  He just did a big gig in Cleveland.  He got nothing.  Two shows.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't fucking matter.  Two sold-out theater shows and he got nothing after the shows.  Nothing.  I'm not actually sure what we're talking about.  Getting a blowjob on a bus by a hot groupie girl.  Oh.  Yeah.  See, once again, we've fallen into those rock cliches and expectations of what being in a 
[01:04:30]  band and touring is about.  Interesting.  We must all live vicariously through you rock stars.  What can we say?  Well, what is going on on the rock bus?  Everyone assumes there's a lot of drugs and drinking and naked girls.  You tell us.  What is on the...  Not on the Mudvayne bus.  No?  Well, what's on the rock bus?  Drinking, obviously.  All right, so the drinking is what's happening.  And maybe occasional drugs.  All right, so we got the drugs, right?  Got a Philip K. Dick book right now.  Really?  Reading Vallis, yeah.  You get a lot of reading.  Yeah.  Wow.  That really does kind of part ways from the school of all these... 
[01:05:00]  From the naked chicks.  Yeah, all these strange expectations.  No naked chicks whatsoever.  We're crazy to think that, I guess.  Yeah, the booze and the drugs are accurate, but the chicks, you're probably turning them  down.  That's why you're not.  I don't know if you're married.  Do you have a girl?  Maybe you're just going, no, I don't want to fuck around the road.  Too risky.  Okay, so you don't want to fuck around the road.  But you probably could if you wanted to.  Actually, probably not.  Girls don't really like Mudvayne very much.  No?  We could probably get as many 12 to 14-year-old pimply-faced boys that we want, right, Chad?  Oof.  Even better. 
[01:05:30]  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to Mike.  He has a question for you guys.  Mike, what's going on?  Hello?  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, question for you.  He's scared, I don't know.  You're giving a little jimmy shit about wanting to take pictures of stars.  How do you feel about the people who are spending their hard-earned money to go out and buy your damn album  and not willing to give them a couple seconds to return?  I don't think he was giving people shit about getting pictures.  He was just saying he wanted them to ask, like just saying, hey, can I get a picture?  It's not one of your favorite things to do, is what you're saying. 
[01:06:00]  No, I didn't say we don't do pictures with people.  We do pictures with people every day.  And I think what we were mentioning about were the stalkers, the people that come out of nowhere  and flash pictures at you and you don't even know they're there and they don't even approach you  or introduce themselves.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to BJ.  Not liking that.  BJ, what's up?  Not much.  Hey, Mudvin, how you doing?  What's up, man?  I just had a question about the whole face paint and the mask things that you used to do.  How come you guys dropped that?  Was it just something that you outgrew, got bored of?  Who said we dropped it? 
[01:06:30]  When you started doing the alien faces, it kind of turned into a gimmick and it was gay.  Okay, so he just answered his own question.  There you go.  We decided that it was just way too gay.  Yeah, we were gay.  Get out of it.  You know, it was just a gaytrocity.  Let's go to Frank in New York City.  Frank, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Who are these disingenuous whining fucks who said they'd rather work for a living?  Shut up.  Get up and get a job and get up every day like the rest of us. 
[01:07:00]  I don't think they said they'd rather work for a living.  I didn't sign up for this.  I just signed up to drum.  Shut up.  Wow.  Sir, I take it you're having a slight problem.  Wow.  Yeah.  The fun show just is great fun, isn't it?  Don't have a good time here.  What happened?  We were having fun.  I hope that you're waking up to do customer service work.  Good morning, sir.  No, I have a real job and I work hard every day, but anybody would trade their left nut  to have your life and you're whining because you have to take a couple of pictures. 
[01:07:30]  Well, no.  Who was complaining?  Dude.  Who was complaining?  Settle down.  I think he felt an attitude from you, Matt.  That's all.  You don't sound very happy with your job, sir.  Yeah.  It didn't sound like Opie and Anthony were kind of pressing me to have some fun and talk  about the job and maybe say why we didn't want to wake up this morning.  Wasn't that kind of a dig that we were doing there?  We were kind of doing that together?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's kind of what we were doing.  Dude, we rolled into New York at 4.30 in the morning on the bus.  Yeah, you got to really roll this morning.  I'm sorry.  I'm having a hard time hearing you. 
[01:08:00]  Okay.  Thanks.  All right, man.  There he goes.  Yeah, well, this is coming in a lot, though.  Seth in Jersey.  Seth.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Couldn't be better.  Hey.  All right.  Listen, unlike the other guy, I'm happy with my job, but it's just kind of aggravating  when you hear a good band that's been out as popular, doing very well, that comes across  when the drummer says, you know, I didn't try enough to do this, you know, I'm just here  to drum.  Dude, actually, you're here, you know, your fans pay a lot of money to come out, hard-earned  money to come out, buy your album. 
[01:08:30]  See, the last thing they want to hear is you complaining, saying, this is the last thing  I want to do.  I didn't try enough to be a model.  All right.  I file my official apology.  Gee, I apologize.  We were just having a little fun.  I apologize.  My condolences to everybody that works.  I really appreciate people coming to the shows, and it's an honor to be able to be playing  NASFest right now, and we love it.  You're definitely, I mean, you're definitely still having fun doing this, right?  Of course.  Of course.  That's why we do it.  There you go.  There you go.  Let's go into some other things here. 
[01:09:00]  John in Iowa.  What's up, John?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, I really like that new album.  It's really good.  The whole album's great, and it's been a long time since I've heard a real good rock album,  but there's a fun song on there.  It's got these freaky little voices that go, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  And I just wanted to know what was behind that, maybe, and who did it.  I don't know.  I think the...  Well, the name of the song is Choices.  Yeah, the name of the song is Choices, and it's the...  The new CD's Lost and Found, by the way. 
[01:09:30]  It's that game that every kid plays, you know, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  So that's the idea behind it, is making a choice, and the people on it were our producer's  children.  Yeah, it was Dave Portman's kids.  He's got two daughters and a son that came in and did it.  Well, you did it, too, with him.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to another Chad.  Chad, what's up?  Hey.  Chad, you've got the coolest name on the planet. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, first off, I can attest to the fact that Matt is a very, very kind individual if  you show him respect.  Thank you.  I really appreciate you saying so.  That's all we were trying to say.  And you're going to say Chad's an asshole, right?  No, you know what?  I really appreciate you saying so.  Yeah.  Because I enjoy meeting people and I enjoy making friends.  Yeah.  I just don't like being stalked.  Oh, yeah.  I completely understand.  Why?  But I want to know what brought about the change between Lost and Found and especially the  second half of LB50. 
[01:10:30]  Was it just personal growth or?  You know, we keep an attitude with our creative process that we're not trying to recreate  a moment, but we're trying to find out where the band is at the time that we're writing.  So, I mean, I don't know if it's change or growth.  It's just, you know, life changes and life moves along.  And, you know, the band's a different band than we were four years ago.  People do get pissed off at that.  And a lot, they like to throw out the word sell out a lot whenever you do something. 
[01:11:00]  And they don't understand that a band is a group of guys that are, the longer you're  together, the more you're going to change.  Absolutely.  Your ideas change.  The gel between the guys and everything.  And you're going to be different.  Why does it have to remain the same?  You don't want to keep writing the same record.  No.  You know what I mean?  And you'll have just as many people pissed off at you.  And if you're lucky enough.  You keep doing the same thing over and over and over again.  You want your music to be honest.  I mean, that's what we really, really strive for.  If you're lucky enough to be successful long enough, you'll have people crawling out of 
[01:11:30]  the woodwork saying, these motherfuckers, man, they were great years back.  And then now they've sold out.  They've changed.  You can't try to meet people's expectations.  Nah.  You know, I mean, and I always felt like if we were smart enough, maybe we could have been  a pop band and, you know, we could second guess what people like to listen to.  But I don't think we're quite that smart.  I think with us, you know, what our fans have appreciated is just the honesty.  You know, we just try to make the most honest music we can.  More lucky people like it.  You read message boards or anything about it?  No.  No? 
[01:12:00]  You don't even touch them?  I want to do a Mudvayne Haters message board on our site.  We already have one, don't we?  Just to get wrong.  No, that's the only one we have.  That's the whole thing.  Well, whenever you have a lot of people with message boards, that, for some reason,  the people that are attracted to that are the people that really just want to bash  the shit out of you.  Most people don't even have anything to say about Mudvayne.  Really?  It's like people just literally just talking.  A lot of infighting?  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  It's just a strange thing, the message boards.  I do know that, or at least I think, anybody who has a message board dedicated to them  or that they're involved with in some way, shape, or form, does read.  You go to it at some point.  Have you ever read a post on a message board?  Uh-uh.  You?  On ours?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I haven't.  I mean, people tell me all the time.  Yeah?  Because that's odd that you wouldn't.  Yeah.  A lot of people do.  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't say anything. 
[01:13:00]  Maybe I should just keep my mouth shut.  You know, dude, if you were into your fans, you'd read their fucking posts.  I like this, Matt.  Matt, you're all right.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Right when the record came out.  Yeah.  Like, just.  Out of curiosity, you want to see one?  Man, it's like, whatever.  Yeah.  It's like, people not even talking about the record.  I'm going, shit.  Yeah.  You know, you want to get some feedback or something?  Somebody sees something about it.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Nothing.  Go to Amazon.com and read all those posts.  It's like, where you can buy the record.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  You might see something there.  Are you guys all from Peoria?  No.  We're all from different parts of Central Illinois.  Mm-hmm.  Illinois.  You're Richard Pryor fans?  Absolutely.  All right.  Good.  He's from Peoria.  I read that.  I was very happy.  I just watched.  You're crazy the other night.  Doesn't his son still live there?  I think he has a son that lives in Peoria.  Really?  Illinois.  I mean, I don't know any more than that, but...  Let's say hi to Tim in Tennessee. 
[01:14:00]  Tim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning, the Man Mellons.  Hey, I was listening to those other callers whine about guys in the band not wanting to  take pictures.  And, you know, last time I checked, you buy a CD, you get the music on the CD, and that's  what you're paying for.  And if these guys don't want to take time to do anything else, well, that's too fucking  bad.  You know?  That's not really what they said.  Matt just doesn't like to be stalked and, you know...  No, no, no.  He's actually agreeing.  The guys in the band have every one?  No, I know he's agreeing, but he's also saying that the other calls were saying you guys don't 
[01:14:30]  like it at all.  That's not what the point Matt was making.  We do, every day we do, we do meet and greets and stuff every single day.  We're doing, we're doing 150 people a day at OzFest or whatever it is.  Well, you think about that, you know, if you do a minute per person, that's 150 minutes.  You guys don't have time to take a shit, so...  You don't do a minute per person.  I'm all for a free choice of whatever you guys want to do.  Just keep putting out good tunes.  I appreciate that.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thank you.  Seriously.  All right, let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  What's going on, guys? 
[01:15:00]  How you doing?  Thanks for crying, Rob.  A lot of great music, guys.  Me and my brother are big fans.  I first saw you guys at the Summer Sanitarium Tour at Giant Stadium a couple years back.  But I wanted to ask where you guys got your name from, because from what I hear, it's  like a sling for asshole.  I just wanted to know if that's true.  Wow.  I often wondered about that.  You know, that never occurred to me, actually.  After we threw that out there, like, years ago, I was thinking, man, I hope that people  don't think that.  Yeah, is that like an anal reference?  Yeah, that's an anal reference.  Yeah, it sure is.  Absolutely.  It actually came from, have you ever heard of a fish called a carp? 
[01:15:30]  You ever heard of that fish?  Yeah, he's out, but yeah.  He's gone, or whatever.  And I was literally driving around the Decatur Dam, and I looked down, and I saw some people  fishing.  And I was like, I remembered fishing there with my dad, or whatever, and it was just  like really boring, and like no action, and no fishing.  Basically, you just sit there with your wine in the water.  And every once in a while, you catch a carp, and it'd be like, woo, got one on, woo! 
[01:16:00]  You know, and you'd reel it in, and it'd be like, oh, it's a carp.  You can't keep that one, and you throw it back, because it's got a mud vein.  So, that's where I came up with it.  I was just driving around the dam.  You know what?  I've never heard that story.  That's the first time I've heard that story.  Yeah.  I've never heard that.  I thought it was the pink laser shot from the Sirius star system that sent the name  like right at the top.  I was driving around the dam when the pink laser hit me.  Maybe you were struck by the pink laser from the Sirius star system. 
[01:16:30]  The dog star.  The dog star.  Let's go to Rich in Ohio.  Rich, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Little Jimmy.  Hey, what's up, man?  Yo, mud vein, you guys fucking tore it up Saturday.  Awesome.  Thank you.  I saw you up at the Burgerstown at the Post-Cazette Pavilion, and these motherfuckers  that say that you guys don't work apparently ain't never been to one of your shows.  Thank you.  Because I am a fucking lobster today.  My forehead, my nose, my arm.  Oh, man.  It was fucking 4 o'clock.  Everybody I was with was, come on, let's go.  I can't fucking take it anymore.  I'm like, kiss my ass, motherfucker.  I ain't leaving until mud veins done. 
[01:17:00]  So you guys rock, and I still feel it because I'm on fire.  Awesome, dude.  Rock on.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  One thing that we always, you know, we've always tried to bring to the stage is, I know  it sounds kind of idealistic or whatever, but like we treat every show like as a singular  moment, and it's a moment that the fans and that we get to have that's unlike any other,  and every show is that.  And it kind of, I think it keeps us pretty vital and keeps us pretty excited about our  shows.  I mean, we get, we get really excited about playing. 
[01:17:30]  That's what we do.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Dave in Queens.  Dave.  Yo, what's going on?  What's up, Dave?  What's up, man?  Nothing all fucking good.  Yo, I saw you guys way before you guys broke out when you were playing with Ultra Spank and  Slipknot down in Houston.  There you go.  2000 probably.  You guys were fucking ridiculous that night.  I went there to see Slipknot and I left being a huge fan of you guys, and I'm glad to  know you guys are fucking assholes, too, because it helps me relate a lot more.  It really does.  It helps me relate with you motherfuckers.  Yo, love you guys.  Fucking Jimmy.  Yes.  Oh, man. 
[01:18:00]  What I do to suck on your meaty tits, you fucker.  I love you.  You are a good egg.  Gotta love the satellite radio.  Good egg.  Wow.  Let's go to Joe.  It sounds like you've got your own stalker.  Oh, yeah.  It's fucking a complete psycho.  We've got many.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey, Mudvayne.  You guys fucking rock.  Awesome record.  Thank you.  Love all the records.  As a matter of fact, my four-year-old daughter loves to get in the truck, and she said,  Daddy, put on the Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Moe's on.  She's getting ready to celebrate her fourth birthday now. 
[01:18:30]  Congrats.  You guys know you've got a four-year-old Mudvayne fan out there.  Dude, you know what, I probably hear that in the signing line every day.  I mean, I hear so much about people saying, you know, putting on Determined and their kids  dancing to it and stuff.  Yeah, that's awesome.  So that's really cool, man.  Awesome.  Hey, thanks, guys.  All right.  You guys ever think it would have gotten this big?  Oh, absolutely not.  This is an absolute anomaly.  Like when you start out, you guys just got together.  You had fun playing together.  Thought you'd do some local gigs and have a good time, right? 
[01:19:00]  And, you know, really, for us, it was about writing.  I mean, we really enjoyed just writing music.  Do you remember the moment when you realized, oh, my God, holy crap, this is going to take  off?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  What was it?  Was it anything good?  Was it hearing it on the radio?  A song on the radio?  We've got, we have like a little bit of personal mythology in the band.  And at a certain point, we collectively identified a moment and specified it and said, this is 
[01:19:30]  from, this is the point forever.  This is the now forever.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You had a sign?  Well, there was a moment where we said, where we just realized like what we were doing.  The gravity of what it was.  You know, it meant something in that people were probably going to receive it and we wanted  to be, we wanted to be a part of it.  It was about six months before we got a record contract.  And make it our whole life.  Yeah.  You know?  And that's when we, it was all kind of.  Absolutely.  It got a little bit bigger than just us.  Like we were saying in the beginning of the interview. 
[01:20:00]  Um, I don't know.  I don't want to say too much more.  Why?  Sounds kind of interesting.  Well, it just sounds to me like devil worship.  Sounds like ritual.  There's a little bit of that ritual.  A little satanic ritual.  Sounds like it might have been a Ouija board.  Are we going to get popular?  When we got, after we got a record deal, I was like.  Actually, we just shook that eight thing.  Yeah, the eight ball.  The eight ball.  The magic eight ball.  I was going to say, it wasn't an eight ball.  And we flipped it over and it said, yes. 
[01:20:30]  I said, yes.  And I was like, oh my God.  I, when we got signed, I at one point said, I would be shocked if we sold 150,000 records.  Like, or sold 100,000 records.  Like, that was not going to be possible.  And you guys have sold at least 200.  Yeah, we actually, you know what?  I think we hit close to two, didn't we?  200.  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  We're working at it.  We're still hoping.  All right, let's.  I'm going to ask you a question too.  So, Bill Ward, most underrated drummer ever. 
[01:21:00]  He's a jammin' drummer.  You know what was really ridiculous?  Like, when he's just playing.  Yeah, just sit around.  Like what you probably saw.  Holy shit.  He is really, really good.  Really good.  It's like, you can tell that he's not just, you know, showing up two weeks before the  tour starts to, okay, I've got to play drums again, haven't seen him for a year kind of  thing.  No, he's into it.  You can tell he is about drumming.  He can play.  He can really play.  All right, let's say hi to Joey on Long Island.  He's got a question.  Joey!  Hey, Joey. 
[01:21:30]  Hey.  What's up?  Turn down your radio.  You're on.  Can you hear me?  Yep.  Hey, I'm a big fan.  I heard a lot about your band.  Is it true that Pat Battle sings backup on your last album?  Who?  See ya!  Pat Battle.  Just an ass.  Okay.  What else can I tell you?  Just an ass.  Pat Battle what?  She's a newscaster that we're obsessed with.  People throw her name in.  It's not even worth explaining to these guys.  They're big rock stars.  They don't care.  Hey, you know what?  I've got to care about a Pat Battle.  Better love doing what we do.  I've got better things to do with my times. 
[01:22:00]  Go do some drywalling.  Mike in Winter Haven.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  How are you?  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Look, the first one I heard from you guys is dig.  And right at the time, I was playing paintball.  And like every tournament, we turn that sucker.  We turn it up.  We just crank it out and just beat each other up right before a game.  And then we go and just wreck house against these guys.  It just turned on that switch inside me that just said, go out and just wreck it, man. 
[01:22:30]  Awesome.  Thank you so much, guys.  You guys rock.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  Look at that.  Awesome.  Let's say hi to David in St. Louis.  David.  Hi.  I just want to say that I saw you guys in St. Louis and I thought you guys were awesome.  It was at .517.  Sure.  I was just wondering, how would you guys like playing to sold-out crowds?  Yeah, that was the first time we'd headlined a sold-out radio gig.  That was pretty wacky.  I enjoy playing to sold-out crowds. 
[01:23:00]  A lot more than there's nobody there.  You had to have had the shit gigs early on where you'd...  We're talking about St. Louis here.  Our home.  Totally.  We went down to the Creepy Crawl.  Yep.  And everyone left.  Well, no, no, no.  That was in Denver.  No, that was in Denver.  Also in Quad Cities and in Chicago.  Where Greg was going.  I was sick as a dog.  Literally.  We just were going out on a tour.  When we were financing everything ourselves, we get out to Denver and all of a sudden I just 
[01:23:30]  get crazy sick.  I couldn't even speak.  And Greg is standing next to me at the bar going, dude, here, do a shot of Jack.  No, here, do a shot of tequila.  It'll loosen up your voice.  It's the only time I've ever went on stage with a bus.  The only time ever.  We don't drink or do anything before we play.  I was wasted.  I was wasted.  But yeah, the Creepy Crawl.  We played to like...  Ten people?  Ten people, maybe.  Oh, yeah.  We went back there for that specific reason when we released the new record. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, and we did the whole guerrilla run.  It was all small clubs like that.  We went to the Creepy Crawl and packed that bitch.  A few more of them.  It was really crazy because my drum kit was on the edge.  Is that the show he's talking about?  Which one?  The Creepy Crawl.  Yeah.  They do a sold-out show.  Oh, no, no.  I think he's talking about the...  Well, that was a sold-out show also.  175 people probably.  I was sitting on the corner of the stage in a pillar next to me and all the fans were 
[01:24:30]  literally just standing around my kit as close as chance.  So it was like me playing and everybody just standing there.  That's cool.  That was pretty crazy.  That guerrilla run was awesome for that reason.  Fans helping me do cymbal chokes.  There was no...  You can grab it, you know.  Hey, we got a good friend of the show calling in to say hi.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Jay!  I just want to remind everybody that this past Saturday, Jim Norton is at the Cleveland  Odeon.  Oh, thank you, Jay.  It was very helpful, your plug.  How you doing, Jay? 
[01:25:00]  I'm doing good.  How did it go, Jimmy?  It was good, actually.  Both shows were great and just I fucking struck out horribly with chicks.  Hey, Jay.  So what, you were on like a little...  You were on like a stand-up tour kind of thing?  I just...  I went out and did Cleveland on a Saturday.  And no girls on your bus?  They make it sound like you're gay.  I was saying, dude.  I took a fucking van from the hotel.  Yeah, that's the problem there.  You got to have a sexy bus.  What, Jay?  Every time people talk about stand-up comedy, they make it sound like we're gay.  What are we doing, a little stand-up thingy?  Like, this guy just stopped for 45 fucking minutes, performing for 40 people and vomiting. 
[01:25:30]  Jim sells out a goddamn theater two shows in a row.  He's like, oh, that's cute.  Wow.  Oh, you're right, man.  We do stink as comics.  Fuck.  Yeah, Jay, we got Mudvayne in the studio today.  I know.  I know Mudvayne from our side.  Nice.  Very good.  Do you guys know who Jay Moore is?  I'm not familiar with myself.  I apologize.  You'd know him in a second if you saw him.  Where would I know him from?  Saturday Night Live.  That's Comic Standing. 
[01:26:00]  Oh.  I'm terrible with TV.  I don't see enough TV.  Suicide Kings, great movie.  Oh, Suicide Kings.  Yeah, absolutely.  Jay was in Suicide Kings and many, many others.  Oh, okay.  Let's not forget Paulie.  Oh, yeah, wow.  The kids love Paulie.  The kids love Paulie.  The kids love Paulie.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  I have exceptional news for you two guys.  Yes?  Yes, Jay.  For three.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Well, there's two others in the studio.  It's five today.  Five.  Well, I don't know them and they don't know me, so let's just make a whole thing out of it. 
[01:26:30]  Okay.  We got Chad and Matt.  I don't want to get caught in the crossfire.  I saw your movie.  How much?  Paul Anka is the guest star on Las Vegas today in the filming.  Oh, really?  Oh, he also...  Can I say bang or should I say seeing?  Girl 3?  How about live with?  Live with.  Co-habitating.  He lives with Nicky Cox.  Which one?  Let's do it.  Now they're seeing a...  I totally know who you are.  Now they're seeing a picture of you like a movie star.  Hey, do you like Stalkers and having your picture taken? 
[01:27:00]  Only when I'm actually in the bed.  Nice.  Absolutely.  I know who you are.  Here's a glamorous story about Jay Moore.  Jay and I were doing a college together in Florida years ago.  You were in a...  Did you play in a...  Jerry Maguire?  Yeah, I was going to say Jerry Maguire.  It's not going to sound stupid if I say that.  Yeah.  Awesome.  See, Jay, you just impressed them.  He was the scum bag agent.  But I want to hear Jimmy's story.  Oh, this is a cute one.  Listen to this.  I'm opening for Jay in a college in Florida.  And he goes, hey, Jim, Jim, come in here.  And I walk into his hotel suite and I walk into his room and he's on his bed naked, on 
[01:27:30]  his hands and knees with his asshole open laughing.  Wow.  You know what?  Beat that, Mudvayne.  I would say people, you know, almost every interview, say, oh, what's the craziest thing  that's happened to Mudvayne on the tour?  I'm speechless right now.  I couldn't even...  I couldn't get within two feet of that.  I was going to tell you, Mudvayne, two things happened with that, uh, with that, uh, antics  that I pulled.  One is, two things are going to happen. 
[01:28:00]  One, you're either going to get fucked, or two, and I'm going to leave you alone the  rest of the time.  Yeah, it's definitely set to precedent.  That was fucking hilarious.  And I kept coming back to the room hoping he'd reenact it.  It's very hot.  See these comics, they get wacky, Mudvayne.  Had something, had something had been in there, though, right?  Was that?  Something had been in there.  You could tell, right?  Yeah, it was not the first time you've been in that.  Yeah, something had been in there.  Oh, no, yeah.  Something had been in there.  Diddling yourself.  I can't get short.  Hey, y'all, why don't you tell Mudvayne who you're now living with, Jay? 
[01:28:30]  What?  Aren't you on your own show?  Didn't you have been listening?  They didn't hear it.  See, we do not listen on the show.  We've made that perfectly clear.  But did you hear who Jay Moore is living with?  No, I have no idea.  Bob Sugar.  He lives with Nicky Cox.  Oh, good God.  Really?  I swear to God, it's good.  I swear to God, you guys just said it.  No one, they didn't hear it, though.  No, maybe there were five people talking at the same time. 
[01:29:00]  They were showing a picture of you.  Did you say it?  No one listens on this show, Jay.  Someone did say it, though.  Oh, someone said, I'm all ears now.  But they're now hearing it for the first time.  Man, I've never met a movie star.  The great Hollywood actress, Nicky Cox.  Yeah, this is fun.  I've never really talked to a movie star before.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, real awesome.  It's a new plateau in my life, actually.  The movie is getting airbrushed out of the poster.  Let me explain.  How about that, King's Ransom?  The poster's out, and they airbrushed all the white people out of the poster.  Wow.  Did they really?  Wow. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, Jay.  We went to the lawyers on that one.  We, too, thought it was really cool to meet a Hollywood star until, you know, he hangs around a while,  and then you realize he's just as sick as everyone else.  Yeah, he's naked in bed.  Posted.  He's posting in bed.  We've all seen his penis.  Posted up.  Posted.  We've seen him do things with his penis.  Yeah.  You guys, you guys sound like a bunch of fun guys to hang out with.  We're really not making a good impression of the fucking rock star.  A bunch of homo stories.  Yeah, I know.  Remember that time you showed me your car?  No, no, no, no.  When we saw Jay's penis, it had something to do with a young lady, well, not too young, named 
[01:30:00]  Chocolate.  A woman named Chocolate.  I was sliced like a fucking human.  We saw, allegedly, because we're not really sure what we saw, we saw Jay bang a black hooker  from Harlem once.  It was nice.  Live on our show.  I'm going to be going back to my bus to sit in my back lounge and read some Dostoevsky.  Yeah.  That's what I'll be doing this afternoon.  A little reading.  Yeah.  A nice way to wind down.  Sure.  Have an espresso and some Dostoevsky.  You're not going to spray your ass cheeks and call someone in the room? 
[01:30:30]  No, I don't think that's going to be happening.  What's that, Jay?  I heard when you guys were talking about certain people not coming on the show, and Anthony  and you guys, you're saying that these people were dead to you, and then I went on Whack  Bag and saw the pictures of the gravestones of certain, you know, like Brewer, Dice, Lewis  Black, Carlos Mancia, and Anthony said, I was driving with my buddies, and Anthony said,  Jay fucking Moore.  That's right, Jay fucking Moore.  And everyone tore me a new asshole. 
[01:31:00]  I went back on the show, and everyone crushed me.  You know what is a credit to Jay?  Everyone was bashing Jay before he called and got back with the show.  After I called.  They were bashing me after I called.  Yeah.  Big Hollywood star.  But you turned it around.  That's how he stands with our show.  I love it.  He turned it around so quickly because he's a funny motherfucker.  That's just the way it is.  Jay, did you feel your appearance was bad?  As opposed.  It was good.  Jimmy, I've been waiting the entire phone call, wondering when he set me up. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know.  Next thing I know, Jim Norton says, was it bad?  You're Harvey Keitel.  It's all I think about.  I don't even want to talk to him anymore.  That's the reason I called.  Jimmy, the series must go to Southern Games.  I went to the park today, and I saw a day of struggling. 
[01:32:00]  And I looked him in his eyes.  And he told me he's saving it for the big one.  Oh, my God.  Your kid doesn't.  Jackson, I'm obviously doing Harvey Keitel.  Your kid doesn't shut up, does he, Jay?  Oh, my gosh.  Do that when I'm doing walking.  I don't even like doing walking anymore.  That is a talkative little kid.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  And he can take a punch.  All right.  Two things.  I called to do waiting in vain to be set up for Keitel. 
[01:32:30]  And I just called because I left the other day driving by myself,  just thinking of Anthony for no reason on the side, going,  no, man, I'm pretty fucking soft.  All right.  Any other questions for Mudvayne, Jay?  How about one?  Just one question.  How about a question they've never been asked before?  Because that's what we try to do on this show.  I don't think we were too successful.  Have you ever?  How old are you guys? 
[01:33:00]  Oh, shit.  There's a question.  Okay, that's it.  That's the only question you can ask.  Approaching 37 way too quickly.  Have you guys ever, when you were kids, out of curiosity, blown another kid?  Blown another kid?  Good question.  Well, you didn't specify male or female, so I'm not going to say.  Okay, but that gives me, that gives me the, no, no, no, but that gives me a window to  say, uh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Put that up on work bag.  Oh, and by the way, everyone, it's Freak 8. 
[01:33:30]  There's your show mention.  Stop posting.  It's Freak 8.  And more pictures of me and Cox fucking as monkeys.  Nice.  Yeah, very good.  Hey, Jay, I'll be happy to answer your question, and I'll even break it down by ethnicity.  Jim, boys blow each other every day.  It's the rain.  They want to put up their own words.  I'm a Catholic.  I'm blessed.  The Keitel's a little off today.  I'll make it up to you, Jimmy.  What's that, buddy?  The Keitel's a little off this morning. 
[01:34:00]  I'll make it up to you.  No, it sounds great.  I'm talking about it.  It sounds exactly like Keitel.  You love the Keitel.  Stop.  He was shot in the gut.  It's my fault.  He was shot in the gut.  Reservoir Dogs.  Yeah.  Nice.  Good call.  I love you, boys.  All right, Jay.  Love you, Jay.  A true friend of the show.  Ask me if I'm okay.  You okay?  Nah, man.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  Punching up, boys. 
[01:34:30]  Later, Jay.  See ya.  Jay Moore calling from Hollywood.  That guy's awesome.  This is a rip, man.  This kid in the background.  You want to explain Monster Rain to these guys before we let him go?  He's calling from Hollywood?  Oh, yeah.  This is satellite radio.  We're everywhere.  Jesus Christ.  What time is it there?  I was going to say.  Why is he even awake?  He's got the kid.  Kid, man.  God, what a nightmare.  That's the big...  She is a fucking hot.  Which one?  You go with...  That's Aguilera.  You go with Aguilera?  Aguilera.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I have...  On the wall.  Dude, that is the hottest picture, dude. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, I'm like I'm realizing I'm surrounded by Naked Diamond.  Yeah, well...  Look at that.  We got to keep morale up in here.  She is really just uber hot.  I was more of a fan of Britney Spears.  No.  Super, super sexy, man.  Christina blew away Britney from beginning to end.  Dude, she's skinny.  She's like...  I know.  She's a little fidget.  Yeah, like four foot three or something.  I love it.  A fidget?  A fidget.  Ooh, a fidget.  I like that.  Is that a spinner?  No, that's what they call them in the Little Rascals.  I believe in that fidget.  They call them the Little Rascals. 
[01:35:30]  We call them spinners.  Spinners?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get them up there and spin them.  Yeah.  Jessica Simpson, yes or no?  No.  No?  I'm out.  The new video, though?  I don't care.  She looks great.  The new video?  I don't care.  I know she's dumb and...  Don't care.  Nope.  I'm not a big fan of her.  Really?  Nope.  Not at all.  Washing the car?  Nope.  I don't know what it is.  Nope.  Out.  Out.  Out.  I was with you until I saw the new video.  Yeah.  What about Dukes of Hazzard?  Is she going to...  She looks very hot in that.  How she's going to do that?  Well, the Daisy Dukes, where the name came from, yeah.  She's wearing those little... 
[01:36:00]  Have you seen the video?  No, I haven't seen it.  That's why.  When you see this video...  Without faint.  Oh, my God.  I think I've seen it.  Well, we should let these guys go.  I think we had fun here.  Gentlemen.  I think Matt started off like, ugh.  But I think...  No, I didn't start off like, ugh.  I just sat down and just did my thing.  He didn't have his coffee yet.  He didn't have his coffee yet.  No, it's not good.  But I think we all got along.  The whole planet...  You got to...  The whole planet sucked.  Until he had a Starbucks.  But now he's okay.  So you guys playing Ozzfest, PNC tomorrow and Wednesday.  That's right.  Two days in a row.  We'll be there tomorrow. 
[01:36:30]  Two days in a row.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, yeah.  Absolutely.  Will you acknowledge him if you see him backstage or...  Absolutely.  You will.  Uh, fuck.  Yeah.  He will be back there.  Hey, you know what?  There is a certain job description I have.  It doesn't mean I have to be friends with just anyone.  You better sign up for that.  I do love that about radio because there's so many times, you know, we'll have a really good  interview with a band or something.  Then we go to the show and we're backstage like, ugh.  Now we're all friends.  And zip right by like they don't even know you.  Security, have them removed.  It's like, but what happened on our show?  We were all were... 
[01:37:00]  We were just pals.  But the worst is when you realize they did recognize you and just didn't give a fuck.  Like, ugh.  They didn't remember me.  Hey, remember we talked?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I know.  Ugh.  Fuck.  Just keep walking up.  Some happy surprise.  I thought we were going to go on the tour bus and drink and drug and...  And three books.  ...together.  Yeah.  This is one of the nicest smelling microphone.  Yeah, it is actually.  That's because that's the one that's never used by anybody.  Yeah, both of us.  Well, it's frightening me that it smells so good.  Really?  Because you guys...  It's spritzed. 
[01:37:30]  It's been spritzed.  We don't let other people use this studio.  Bysol, disinfectant, Febreze, Reichen.  Jimmy's you wouldn't want to use, or Opie's you wouldn't want to use.  We gasp it to him.  Because he...  Yeah, if Jimmy gets a good fart rolling, he'll shove his ass right against it and just let  it rip.  Only my mic.  Nobody else.  Did you ever do the cup and toss?  That's the new one.  Oh, God, yeah.  The cup and toss?  Yeah, he does that.  Dude, we saw somebody...  We saw a dude with his kids in a pickup truck.  We were driving along, and straight up looked over, and this dude cupped and tossed.  Right there in the front seat driving with his kids.  I'm like, what is he...  And he just tossed it right in his face. 
[01:38:00]  I'm like, that dude cupped a fart.  You've got to hold it for a second, and you just open it like it's a gift.  Right in somebody's face.  Let it slowly waft into their face.  No, he tossed it in his own face.  He cupped and tossed.  Oh, in his own face?  Yeah, he cupped and tossed.  Straight up.  Welcome to the Opie and Andrew.  Oh, dinner.  Hey, man.  Here you go.  No, no, no.  That's cool.  Keep it. 
[01:38:30]  Mmm, chicken.  It's the worst.  Opie and Anthony.  Let's go to Troy's mixtable love for Melissa.  Ooh.  The guy brought it up.  It's true.  Whatever.  Troy's mixtable love for Melissa.  Where's Martini Steve?  We've got to get him back into the studio.  Martini Steve getting a lot of air time lately.  It makes me physically ill.  Where's Steve?  Steve?  Steve.  Steve. 
[01:39:00]  Steve.  Where's that lebedy sex addict?  Hey, Steve.  It's circling.  Come on.  Steve, land.  I cannot wait until that gets old.  It won't ever.  You'll hear a hybrid car.  It will.  Mulatto.  Mangro car.  It will. 
[01:39:30]  It will.  I'll just, you know, smile through it and, you know, someone else will roll under the  bus at some point.  Yeah, I'm sure that'll happen.  Yes, with a little no-gas-guzzling car running under that bus.  Steve, what do you got on this mixtape?  You're going to be the first man who paralyzes himself running over a power cord in that little  pinky car.  That's very safe, Jimmy.  Yes.  This is, someone sent me a link last night and it goes to, I think it's called, Troy's 
[01:40:00]  mixtape.com is actually the address in it.  I guess this kid, 16 or 17 years old, made an audio love letter for his girlfriend of  six months.  Six months?  Yeah, six months.  It's a whopping anniversary.  And he's in pretty deep.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And it has got to be the most affectionate thing I've heard in a while.  Aw.  It's sickling.  Is it like Bill's audio?  Remember Bill, the intern, made the audio of his young girlfriend and he said how much 
[01:40:30]  he loved her and he enjoyed being with her and that someday she'd be old enough to understand  what he was saying?  Fucking creep.  Wow.  Maybe he was just being shocked with his rapport.  Shocked.  No, he wasn't.  It's a shocking turn.  All right, well, here's a little taste of Troy talking about the love of his life, Melissa.  Happy six months anniversary, my babe.  Ooh, I love you.  I love you so much.  You are my everything. 
[01:41:00]  I love you so, so much.  Oh, God.  Who's got the douche chill?  Who's got the douche chill?  Raise your hand.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  Troy's a good boy.  Oh, is that awful?  What's wrong with that?  He's a romantic.  He loves his gal.  This is the shit that should just be kept behind vault doors, you know?  And you're only ten seconds in.  Oh, buttercup.  Did he make her a...  Oh, buttercup.  You're on the air.  Did he make her a mixtape of all the songs?  Oh, he does one better.  He sings them for her.  No, he doesn't. 
[01:41:30]  It's got to be a joke.  No.  Six months has gone by so fast, and this has been the best six months of my entire life.  It really has been the best six months of my entire life.  And it's all because of you.  Oh, Jesus.  You're the best thing that's ever happened to me or will ever happen to me.  I'm the luckiest guy on the face of this earth.  And I know I'm the luckiest guy on earth to have you. 
[01:42:00]  And I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever want to lose you.  Ever.  You mean so much to me.  You mean more than anything in my life.  You mean everything.  You are my everything.  I'm in love with you.  I'd be lost without you.  Wow.  You really went above and beyond the call of duty for that one, Jim. 
[01:42:30]  That was a bare-ass fart into the mic.  Like, oh, pants pulled down, cheeks right against the mic.  Fantastic.  Oh, God.  Oh, come on.  Toughen up.  Sure in six months you'll be using it for fuel.  Honey, I know it's disgusting, but it's cheaper. 
[01:43:00]  Steve, what did I tell you?  That was good.  I would.  I would, actually.  Don't encourage him.  Oh, God.  That was just horrific.  Oh, wow.  We've gotten that comfortable.  Where we get to see your bare-ass every day now.  Yeah, just admit it.  It's the nicer thing you thought it would be.  Supple, you know, yet not soft.  Not a hair to be found.  Not at all. 
[01:43:30]  Young boy, yes.  A proctologist one time described my asshole, and I quote, like an alien's mouth.  All right, well, let's get back to Troy's mixtape of love for Melissa.  Oh, babe.  I love you.  I feel like I've known you all my life. 
[01:44:00]  I can talk to you about anything, do anything around you, tell you anything, and I know you'll  always be there for me.  Okay.  I know that you love me.  I know you care for me.  And I just love you so much.  You're so perfect in every single way imaginable.  I can't believe this could be tangible.  Duh.  No, you really are so perfect in every single way imaginable.  Every single way.  You're the perfect girl for me.  We are a perfect match, Melissa. 
[01:44:30]  We really are.  She's got it bad.  Freaking LaMotta had better mic techniques.  We're so perfect for each other.  Everything about us goes perfectly together.  You beautiful people.  We're the same size.  We're the same size.  We think alike.  I mean, we're seriously perfect for each other.  You're so perfect, Melissa.  It's so unreal and so awesome.  Awesome.  So, so incredible.  And, oh, gosh, so unreal.  I'm so lucky. 
[01:45:00]  So, so lucky.  I am the luckiest guy on the face of this entire earth.  You said, I can smell your cunt.  Yeah.  Yeah, she must swallow.  Psychopath, this guy is.  A lot of people have comments.  Tony in Jersey.  Tony?  Yeah, she must swallow.  That's about the only reason I see doing a tape like this.  No. 
[01:45:30]  This guy is one of those guys that would kill himself, that probably did kill himself after she broke up with him.  Or should.  We should.  She heard this, and, like, she probably got so, what do you, you see this?  Well, go on, finish, finish.  No, I'm saying she probably dumped him because of this.  She was probably a little tired of this groveling weasel.  Right.  I didn't sense it.  You nailed it, yeah.  That's about the only reason I didn't want to say something.  All right, let's go to Corey.  Corey?  I would rather be stuck in an attic in New Orleans than listen to this shit.  Holy crap. 
[01:46:00]  They broke up three days after this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll bet you they were on the outs a little bit, and he could sense she was getting tired of him.  They thought he'd better, yeah.  And he'd woo her over, and this just sent her for the fucking hills.  Yep.  Well, let's get back to the tape.  Ever, ever, you are the best thing that's ever happened to me, or will ever happen to me.  You are the best ever, Melissa.  There's no better out there.  You are, for sure.  The best ever. 
[01:46:30]  The best ever.  And I'm serious.  There is no better out there.  You are the best ever.  The best there is, and this there ever will be.  You're the perfect girl for me.  We have so many memories together, and I'll never forget any of them.  I kiss you on the mountain.  Watermelon head.  Everything.  Everything.  Everything.  We're just, we just go together so perfectly.  Yeah.  We're just perfect for each other.  And we have so many memories, and so many funny times together, and so many funny experiences. 
[01:47:00]  And there's going to be many, many, many, many more.  Hello, exactly!  I mean, this is like, only one of our many, many, many, many, many anniversaries, and there's many, many, many, many, many, many more to come.  And I know that for a fact.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad.  Oh, God.  Wow.  This is so, ooh.  Yeah.  Chilling. 
[01:47:30]  It's painful.  Want more?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It gets worse here.  I want all of it.  It gets a lot worse.  It gets worse.  I can't get enough of this, kid.  Hey, man.  I think I'll give you a little song and dance.  Are you ready?  It might sound kind of bad, because this microphone sucks really bad.  Okay?  And I'm sort of tired.  But it's not really like a full song.  It's just like a little clip of it. 
[01:48:00]  Okay?  In all my life, I've been for someone like you.  And I thank God that I, that I finally found you.  Eh, eh, eh.  In all my life.  Eh, eh.  I've been for someone like you.  Eh, eh, eh.  Yes, I pray that you feel the same way too. 
[01:48:30]  And I hope that you do love me too.  Sorry, it's not very good, because I'm a little tired.  But I try.  Here, I'll give you another one.  If you're not the one, then what does my hand fit yours this way? 
[01:49:00]  If you're not the one, then what does my soul feel glad?  Stop whining.  Today.  Stop whining.  Oh, babe.  Stop it.  I can't sing anymore.  I love you so much.  Quiet.  Oh, man.  And if you're not the one, then what does my hand fit yours?  And what does my soul feel glad? 
[01:49:30]  I just don't even know.  Maybe it's because you are.  Ha-ha.  We've changed the direction.  Let's say hi to Corinne in New Jersey.  Corinne.  I got it.  Hey, guys.  Ant, I just wanted to ask you, is this kind of what it sounded like when you proposed?  Ha-ha-ha.  Yeah.  Punching out.  It was a little different. 
[01:50:00]  Some guy piling out of a fucking car with Lawrence Hilton Jacobs hair.  You want to get married or what?  What do you say?  Give it a shat.  Spent $200 on this ring.  And you know she had probably a good laugh at this.  Oh, yeah.  While a guy like Jamaican Mike was behind her.  Oh!  All her friends just laughing.  Yeah, what a tool this kid is.  Got together.  You've got to hear this.  The original audio was 14 minutes long.  This is cut down to roughly six minutes.  So she broke up with him and then threw the audio up on the internet. 
[01:50:30]  Of course, she did.  That is awesome.  Oh, you bitch.  Can we get this kid?  I think he's in Utah somewhere, but I'll look.  Well, why don't we try to get him on the telephone?  Yeah, certainly will.  All right, here we go.  You want the last bit of this or no?  More than I want oxygen.  Need it.  I love you so much.  And I just wish you were here right now hugging me and kissing me.  Maybe a kiss if you want.  But for sure a hug.  But maybe a kiss if you wanted to. 
[01:51:00]  Now that would be a dream come true.  You are a dream come true, Melissa.  You are the best ever.  And that is true.  You are the best ever.  Ever.  You really are.  No doubt about it.  You're the best ever.  No matter what happens, you are the best ever.  I mean, seriously.  I'm just trying to show you how much I love you on the CD and tell you so you can always 
[01:51:30]  think of me and know how much I love you when you listen to this.  Well.  You're in me, Melissa.  Oh, shit.  If I lost you, I'll be lost.  I never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  Everyone loves you.  Ever.  Oops, two days, ever, whatever.  I don't want to sleep, I think about you, Ed.  My Dave, I love you.  Ow, choke yourself!  My bed. My bed. You're my bed.  Happy six-month anniversary. 
[01:52:00]  This is only one of many anniversaries we have had and will have.  I love you.  Good night, sweet dreams. I'm in love with you.  I love you.  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you.  Was that a kiss at the end?  Yeah, I think it was kissing.  Those were a bunch of loud kisses.  She broke up with him three days later.  Three days later, his forever turned into nothing. 
[01:52:30]  I think this tape backfired on him.  It makes me sick. And he has hair like sex bagel. He really irritates me.  Yeah, there's a picture.  I'm sure we got this linked to opianthony.com, knowing Steve.  This is what our own Eric would look like if he weren't retarded.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Brad. Brad, what's up?  Wow, the listener is slow to the end.  Brad.  Come on, guys.  How's this out? 
[01:53:00]  Anthony.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Is he kidding me?  I want to be there.  I want to hear the audio of when he finds out his best friend with a 10-inch cock is telling  that this girl is at home.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, what do you guys think?  You think that he lost his virginity to this girl and he's just out of his mind?  Maybe, yeah.  Could you imagine him feeling like that, going over her house and you see maybe she's moving  by the window or something and you go to peek in her room and there's your best friend just 
[01:53:30]  railing her in the ass, he'd have to kill himself.  He would have to kill himself right there.  Mike Jersey, what's up?  Yo, he didn't even bang that chick, did he?  I think he definitely did.  Might have been his first.  Yeah, I think he did.  Either his first.  At the end, he's like, maybe a kiss.  Do you want to?  That'd be nice.  That's true.  Maybe he didn't.  I think he's out of his mind because this girl was his first.  Yeah.  I like to bite that dude's face.  Pumpkin out.  Maybe first BJ or first something going on there. 
[01:54:00]  Hold on, Steve has some input.  What do you have, sweetie?  I was going to say, in that last part of it, he talks about getting a hug from her and a  kiss if she wants to.  So, there wasn't a whole lot of physical contact going on with this relationship.  Oh, come on now.  Really?  You think?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, thanks.  Here goes Steve.  Come on, Steve.  Oh, you can go.  Steve's car doesn't even drive straight. 
[01:54:30]  It just spins in circles with lights around it.  Spaceship riding ass.  John, in Wyoming.  Go ahead, John.  Man, I'm sitting here listening to this shit.  I just want to drive my car into a fucking pole.  That guy, I hope he's crowded up in a closet somewhere just crying his eyes out, drunk off  fucking moonshine.  That is fucking pathetic.  There we go.  I'm sorry.  Every guy's getting the douche chills today.  Let's say hi to John in Michigan, I guess.  John? 
[01:55:00]  Wow.  What's up with the listeners today?  John A.  Must be the hurricane.  John.  I'm a John.  What?  Whoever you are.  Whatever.  Whoever you are.  Talk.  Yeah, that dude had to be a virgin, man.  He outspers one of their dogs and fucking fools could never get a girl, and he finally  got something, and he's all upset about it.  That's true, too.  That could be true.  He's not a bad looking guy, so she's probably like, yeah, he's kind of cute and friendly  and, you know, whatever.  Yeah, and then he pours his heart out on that tape.  You know what I used to do?  I would never sing to a girl, but I would walk by her house with my radio play on when a cool 
[01:55:30]  part of the song came on, like she would look out and associate me with the song.  Yeah, man.  Your Peter Gabriel greatest hits.  You didn't really do that, right?  Oh, yes, I did.  With live Ozzy.  Are you shitting me?  I'm not.  You thought it would associate yourself.  Like with a certain...  Costanza.  Like that?  Like they did on Seinfeld?  What's that?  You put the song in the girl's head, and she associates it with you every time she hears  it.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, dude, I... 
[01:56:00]  Look.  I just, I remember a letter, an anonymous letter I wrote, but I really wanted her to know who  I was.  Anonymous, but not quite anonymous, yeah.  And then I asked her out on the phone.  And she said no.  She's like, no, I don't think so.  She was nice, though.  She wasn't 20.  That's why, you listen to this, and you can laugh and everything, but what guy, you know,  depending on what age you were, didn't have the crush?  Dude, I asked...  That you just, you know, oh, you're like, you wanted that girl so bad.  I said to her, because she was hot.  I said to her, you don't want to go out with me, do you?  I was rubbing the phone book. 
[01:56:30]  And they like confidence.  And she's like, no, I don't think so.  And I was trying to be casual, but I fucked up.  I swear to God, I went, yeah, well, that's how the ball crumbles.  You said that's how the ball crumbles?  You stunk back then.  Oh, Mushmouth.  I think fans got that call for the next flubs.  What?  No.  Bloopers, flubs, and for real teenage humiliations.  I am Iron Man! 
[01:57:00]  As I walk by the house.  Did you time your steps and the part and everything?  Yes.  It just...  Oh, I got to time.  If I walk from this sewer cap over here to that, the door, it should kick in.  Wow.  Wow.  I should have had a nozzle hanging off me.  You had it bad then?  I was...  That's pretty bad.  The letter I wrote, I did something like, I'm like, if you want to know who I am, wear  like such and such a shirt.  It was like serial killerish in a weird way on Tuesday, like a pink shirt on Tuesday. 
[01:57:30]  And she did.  Or something I told her, a signal, and of course she did.  I just liked the fact that we had a little communication.  Oh, my God.  I had no balls or anything growing up.  It was...  I was the worst with girls.  When I was really young, like, I'm talking fifth grade, sixth grade, we had this thing  where we had to make these...  No balls.  You were getting laid at 13.  That's when I was older.  I'm talking fat chicks on a horse.  I'm talking fifth grade and stuff like that. 
[01:58:00]  Fourth grade.  13.  I was still four to five years away from getting laid.  We had to make these dynoramas.  You ever make these in shoeboxes?  You put them in a shoebox and you make these little scenes like Civil War and things like  that.  The pilgrims.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a popular one.  You put a mirror in there for the lake.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you put the little trees that you make and stuff.  So we made those and other classes were invited to come in and you sat behind your diorama  and they would look at it. 
[01:58:30]  You know?  So I had such a crush on this girl and she was walking through and I saw her online and  everything and I was going to try to, and I was imagining what I was going to say to  her and how it was going to go the whole time she was walking toward me.  So she comes up.  She's right next to me ready to look at my diorama and she finally steps in front of me  and after all this plotting and scheming in my head, I just looked at her.  She looked at me, kind of smiled.  I said nothing. 
[01:59:00]  And she walked away.  And all that, what played out in my head was just nothing.  And I kicked myself in the ass for years.  Just a little faggot with a diorama.  That was it.  I should have just cut a big hole in the back and stuck my cock through it.  Grab the tall Nordic character.  Here it is.  This is a diorama of Loch Ness.  That's right.  Go lick the surgeon's photograph.  Cockies. 
[01:59:30]  Dude, you know what?  I wrote this in the notes.  And I'm like almost can't say it.  No, what is it?  I was such a notorious Aussie fan.  It is long.  What did you say?  The Bam Jimmy.  I want to stand back to back and kiss you belly to belly.  I think I wrote Dear Michelle.  How do you spell that?  Yeah, I wonder what his diorama was like. 
[02:00:00]  There's a little shoebox with a mirror in it.  Well, apparently it was snowing in this town.  I wrote something about, I forget what it was, but I wrote, I think Speak of the Devil  was out, like Aussie's album.  Yeah.  But I think I wrote it in like, as a hint, like in Spanish or something like that, like  the name of the scene.  Oh no, in your anonymous letter so she would know it was you because everyone knew you were  an Aussie fan, but you did it in Spanish.  Or something.  So she would have to do it.  A puddle.  Oh, Diablo. 
[02:00:30]  Oh my God.  I should have gotten a restraining order.  That was awful.  Oh, is that horrid?  I used to follow a girl home.  Nice.  Every day.  Really?  Every day, staying about 100 to 200 yards behind her, and then speeding up and getting  closer and closer, and then backing off because I didn't have the balls to actually confront  her.  Day after day, I found out that she would walk home, and it was a good mile from the, this  was in high school, actually.  How long did that go on? 
[02:01:00]  Off and on for...  Present.  Off and on for, I would say over a month.  Really?  Over a month?  Never said a word to her.  Never said a word.  Yeah, a bunch of faggots.  Never said a word, and I really, at the time, I really liked this girl, but I just couldn't  get the balls to actually walk up to her, and even say something like, oh, you're walking,  oh, what a coincidence, something.  I think at the end of it, she knew I was following her.  You know what the thing was? 
[02:01:30]  It wasn't so much that you're afraid to ask, or afraid of rejection because of its rejection.  You had it so worked up in your mind.  I would rather have this hope that it might happen someday than get rejected and know  that the fantasy is just wiped out.  So as long as I don't ask, and she doesn't say no, there's always a chance that down the  line, something's going to happen that will bring us together and will hold hands.  I couldn't face being...  That's the assembly. 
[02:02:00]  You're so right, because at the time, I couldn't face being rejected by her.  Right.  So it was like, you know, walking up, I would get closer, and then my heart would just be  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  I'm like, I would have an anxiety attack, I think.  Yeah.  And then I would back off, like, no, no, today's not today.  Nice long piece of duct tape out, the shovel, waiting to clunk her over the head.  Do you understand, I'm 37, and I'm still doing the same thing?  I can't ask, because I'm afraid they're going to say...  And that ruins it.  Yeah, I want the fantasy.  I mean, this goes way back, but I believe I stopped doing it, because I think she was 
[02:02:30]  onto me, and would start walking a lot faster.  And I'm like, you know what, she's now onto this.  I've got to stop this.  It is him!  I've got to stop this.  Zell!  It is Opie!  The blonde angel!  He's trying to scurry.  I know you, you murderer!  And the old guy from Tiny Make the Donuts is working behind the counter.  I know you, you murderer! 
[02:03:00]  All right, we should take a break.  I have to tinkle up.  What do you say we hang in there together?  I guess we have to.  Everyone pants around their ankles.  That's right, a bunch of men.  You are.  I can't find a bra that will holster my massive hooter.  I'm very proud of my big toe.  Thanks, God, for Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I say, don't you know?  You say, you know?  I say, you know? 
[02:03:30]  Take me out, I say, you know?  I mean, you're a celebrity, Norty.  Oh, whatever.  Vinny, over there.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  In studio, Patrice O'Neal.  Good morning.  I'm not a celebrity.  I'm a very, very, very, very funny guy.  Good morning.  Who's playing the Stress Factory all this weekend.  Tonight, tomorrow.  732-545-HAHA.  H-A-HA.  And the owner of the club is in studio, Vinny.  Yes, Vinny Brand, also a comic and a good friend. 
[02:04:00]  Very funny guy in his own right, yes.  And he was making fun of Patrice O'Neal.  Basically saying, Patrice, say something because you're not selling tickets.  That's what you get.  I can't figure out how to be a celebrity.  Dude, do you know how awful I was?  I went on sale at the Borgata.  Do you understand that, like, an hour and a half later, there was still 40 tickets left?  I'm like, what do I have to do?  You dick.  It's a shame.  I've been on.  Look, if this was the 80s, somebody would know me.  No, no one would know you.  Not even in the 80s.  Oh, look at that awful haircut Vinny had.  Oh, please. 
[02:04:30]  They can't see that on the radio, you fucking idiot.  Yes, they can.  They can feel my pain watching that stupid bull cut with Frankenstein head.  Oh, Vinny.  That really is a prank phone call kind of head.  Oh, it's a prank call, buddy.  Leave me alone on the fucking phone call.  Without the phone call, your show sucks.  That's the owner of the club telling the headliner he stinks.  He stinks.  Wow, way to sell the show this week.  Here's the part that bothers me.  Patrice is definitely funny. 
[02:05:00]  Nobody fucking cares or knows.  Whatever he's doing, it doesn't fucking help.  I don't get it.  I do not get it.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Tomorrow's sold out.  We have a Sweet 16 party coming in.  150 people.  Great.  Are you serious?  They'll never come to the club again.  So you can get sued.  Oh, is that the wrong crowd for him?  I'm only kidding.  I wouldn't let him come in.  I would not let him come in.  There's young girls in that party.  Wow.  There you go.  Patrice is not a nice person.  This is best of both worlds.  Vinny's a comic and a club owner.  This is beautiful.  He has an inside track on all the hackness.  Patrice has been on a self-destruction mode lately with the clubs, too.  I love it.  Just chasing people out. 
[02:05:30]  Two weeks ago.  I love it.  Two weeks ago at the comic store, but I'm on the showroom.  I swear to God, a girl left the fucking club crying.  Not just crying.  She was boo-hooing.  She was running out.  And her boyfriend walking out with no balls whatsoever.  You walked how many people that night?  One.  Two.  No.  No.  Four.  All right.  There were six people in the audience.  Go into comic mode when we were at the comedy clubs doing comedy.  No comic counts that.  Just for that, I'm going to walk the 30 people that are going to show up this weekend. 
[02:06:00]  And it's not a matter of not being funny.  It's just that they are offended and upset.  It's not that the jokes aren't good.  It's that he's just a cocksucker and nobody likes him.  No.  That's true.  The people that stay have a great time.  I told you I was in the hospital.  There was a candlelight visual for my death.  They were praying for my death.  Oh, believe me.  As soon as he woke up, people were like, fuck. 
[02:06:30]  Fat motherfucker, prayer ain't shit.  You know how many comedy-selling comics are going, come on.  Taking bets on my death.  No, not me.  I'm just paying you.  Why do you and your friends hate me so much, Vinny?  I don't hate you as much as you think.  But I am paying you with a check this weekend in case you drop on Monday.  You know what's making me mad?  That cocked this mother-  He tried that out on me!  Really?  You don't try material out on me and then-  You never said it? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, we-  There's two fucking things I want.  Number one, if you drop on Monday, that wouldn't be terrible.  And I'd like that little recorder.  That little fucking Sony recorder.  I'd like that to be mine.  And the funny thing is, I heard it last night when I was there.  He said it again?  He certainly did.  But I would need a baseball bat to the back of your head.  Come prepared.  Oh, see, that's a tough crowd reference.  Him and his smarmy friends all used to say, I never was prepared for a tough crowd.  What is Anthony Clark doing outside the studio?  Who is that guy?  I don't know.  That's a little scary.  Well, Patrice was in the hospital.  That's right. 
[02:07:30]  You're all good now?  Yeah, I mean-  Taking care of yourself?  Yeah.  All right.  No, you're not.  You're not.  You're going to eat like a fucking pig.  You have no control.  No, I'm not.  Wow.  You have no fucking control.  I'll tell you how I'm going to live, not eating that awful food at your goddamn place.  That ain't right, you're wrong.  That's not-  That's fucking wrong.  That guy picked the fries up off the floor against me with his fingers.  Look at his face, trying to laugh, but he's like, come on, dude, don't mess up my fry business.  Jackass.  Oh, 100% pure olive oil.  Yeah, you jack.  Let me tell you, I'll be feeding you fries and wings and all kinds of fattening shit. 
[02:08:00]  That's right.  I'll write that check.  Have a fucking order to go.  Drink this.  What is it?  It's just grease.  Go ahead.  It's fine.  It's fucking melted lard with a straw.  I'll fly that to your heart and go to sleep.  This is just awful.  He's just not selling tickets for you, huh, Vinny?  Well, tomorrow's good.  Tonight'll be good.  He'll sell tickets tonight.  I gotta be...  He's...  Black people don't reserve an event.  They don't fucking plan.  I'm the only one of one and a half black people Vinny has in the club. 
[02:08:30]  That's not true.  I use Wally Collins, too.  That's the half.  One and a half.  One and a half black guy in a year.  Jesus, Vinny.  No, that's not true.  I use a lot of black comments.  Vinny's got a great club.  I like Vinny's club.  And the food's good.  Is it not good, Opie?  It's a pay phone on the wall.  What are you gonna do?  That fucking phone really rocks you.  That really upsets you. 
[02:09:00]  You can't file a goddamn prank phone call.  I hate that stupid...  I don't have to.  The middle has to, and I feel bad for him.  Vinny sees it at his own club, and he does a prank call before he leaves the stage.  Hello.  Yes, Mrs. R.  Mrs. R.  This is Johnny from the...  This is the police...  How many police are in New Brunswick every day he's a cop?  I'm a policeman.  Speaking of mumbling.  Welcome to the Opie and Vinny show. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you.  That's Vinny from the Stress Factory.  That's Vinny Brand.  Hey, how you doing?  You didn't recognize me?  I'm trying to care.  He really wants you out of his seat.  Vinny, sit in your old chair.  Vinny, get out, Anthony, seat.  Who told you to sit there?  We did put you out there on purpose.  I don't care about how fun to move.  I have to.  Anthony doesn't know what to do with himself when someone's sitting in his seat.  Look at Anthony and his fresh new gums. 
[02:10:00]  Mary Jane rotten teeth.  Oh, my God.  You feel better?  Oh, amazing.  Oh, man.  How many of you have a picture?  Ooh, that doesn't look good.  Nice and white, though.  Which one's the bad one?  Both?  The second one, David.  Yeah, there's this one.  That's the bad one?  This one.  Yeah.  Right down there at the bottom.  Oh, yeah.  He's emailing me this.  He missed a nerve.  How can he miss a nerve?  Did he leave it in on purpose, or is that like a mistake? 
[02:10:30]  The dentist fucked up.  My old dentist must have been a, this is going to be really fun to talk like this.  He can't feel his bottom jaw.  Look at him.  My first dentist was a hack, I guess.  Really?  Oof.  This guy's good.  Is he?  Oh, yeah.  How can you tell that this thing?  Well, I was in pain.  I'm not.  I went to him.  He's the best.  Pain's gone.  He's great.  How can you tell that this right here is something? 
[02:11:00]  So it looks just like a shadow.  He knows.  He knows, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Training.  How numb are you?  He's a doctor.  Your throat?  No, like the whole right side of my bottom jaw up to the back of the jaw.  Not the throat, though.  Now I've got to go for Root Canal right after the show.  But wasn't that a Root Canal?  Oh, you're going to stay in the city and do it here?  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  The specialist?  Yeah.  Wasn't that a Root Canal, Anthony?  The thing he's saying is a problem was a Root Canal?  Yeah, but they didn't go far enough down.  Twelve years ago when they did it.  You know, it's going to really hurt.  Oof.  No.  Yeah, it's going to really hurt.  Now, once the nerve is gone, it's a rapper.  It's going to hurt.  It won't hurt.  I've had those before.  No, it's going to really hurt.  You're not scaring me.  I've had them before.  You've had them?  I've had them.  Anthony, listen to me.  Crest?  I understand.  Listerine?  Just something.  Do something to your mouth.  What are you just...  I understand. 
[02:12:00]  I've had a couple of Root Canal.  You know, you joke about piss, but it really does clean you right out.  Does it?  Yeah.  No cavities ever?  I had one.  That's why I'm joking with you because you're in pain.  You have to.  But, you know, I had mine happen in...  I was out of the country.  It's in third world country.  And I had one of those.  In Brazil, right?  Yep.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Like three in the morning, I went to one of those favelas.  Those were the City of God. 
[02:12:30]  They have them.  I went to the City of God and had them.  Little dice.  Little dice was digging a hole in my mouth.  I went there, it was like three in the morning, and I found a...  I had to.  It was that much pain.  LZ, DTS.  No Novocaine, right?  No, cocaine.  Yeah.  Coke.  Just rub Coke on your gum.  Rub Coke.  And right down to the Monte Carlo.  Archaic instrument.  They distract you.  A little poor boy tries to steal your wallet when you go, hey!  They just fucking pull your tooth out.  You have to have the doctor fill out a form to ask if he has AIDS. 
[02:13:00]  Oh!  A little country.  God.  You only have one cavity in your life?  One, yeah.  Wow.  Good genetics, but I got high blood pressure.  Yeah, I was going to say, you're going to take care of anything else.  That's the, you know.  And the coffin, your teeth are going to look great.  Look at his teeth.  They're fucking beautiful.  Beautiful.  His heart's enlarged, but his teeth are fantastic. 
[02:13:30]  Look how big his heart is.  Patrice's always had a big heart.  You missed out.  These two have been just going at it.  Yeah.  Because he owns the club, and he's not selling tickets for them this weekend.  Oh, my God.  So they're just killing each other.  Oh, boy.  Patrice is at the stress factor this weekend.  This is Vinny.  He tells me, this is Vinny.  April's the worst.  Ha!  Who?  April's the worst time in a month.  It's just the worst time of the year.  That's why I booked you and didn't put pressure on you.  Why don't you book famous people, you jackass?  Book me in the good months. 
[02:14:00]  I thought you had a shot.  You have no shot.  Well, I don't.  No, you don't.  That awful racist community you live in.  Yeah, New Brunswick, known for not liking black people.  They don't.  New Brunswick, Newark, Camden, they all hate black people.  They're known for black people being there, but not for liking them.  Well, maybe those two things go hand in hand.  Oh, my God.  Look at Vinny upset about the fries.  Vinny, don't worry.  Not upset about the fries. 
[02:14:30]  He has delicious fries in the back.  They are fucking good fries.  Vinny's, I will say, all kidding aside, Vinny's food is good, and if you don't like it going  down, believe me, three hours later, it's great coming up.  How much of my food has been shit under your chest?  The funniest part of that joke is he thinks I'm a rookie, and I waste it on the chest. 
[02:15:00]  What, am I, an open microphone?  Jesus, chest was two years ago.  Passé.  Oh, shit on the chest is so 98.  Oh, God.  Shit on the chest.  You should headline your own club this weekend.  Screw Patrice.  He does quite often.  Yes, he does.  All right.  Maybe it'll snow tonight, Patrice.  You'll get off the clock.  That is the worst, though, when you headline.  Except for this last time I did okay in Baltimore, but every other time, I've had 30 people there 
[02:15:30]  on a Saturday, and you just look at the staff.  What are you talking about?  Like, when you're in a club, if it's empty, which the Baltimore improv for me has been  brutal a couple times.  Well, are you on in Baltimore?  Now we are.  It's okay.  That's why they don't show up.  If you're not, if you're aware that they're not, don't listen to the radio, who knows  you, stupid?  That's what I'm saying.  You're about as unknown as me if it wasn't for Opie and Anthony.  That's not true.  He did Spider-Man.  He was in the movie Spider-Man.  I mean, I couldn't be as unknown as you. 
[02:16:00]  He's six foot eight and invisible.  How did this happen?  Actually, I think no one knows me unless I did the Opie and Anthony.  I'm unknown.  In the 80s, I'd be somebody.  It's amazing how...  Why do you keep saying in the 80s?  Because...  What are you doing in the 80s?  In the 80s, I'm saying...  Are you a hack?  The things that...  Wait, this is people in the business talking.  I've done four movies.  I've been on Conan O'Brien about six times. 
[02:16:30]  You sound like a whiny bitch right now.  You sound terrible.  Just start saying funny shit.  Maybe people will come see you.  I'm trying to sell tickets to your stupid hat club, Vinny.  Have you done six Conas?  You sound like you're begging.  Who's booking that?  Who's booking Conan?  That's not the awful comedian interrupt you.  Who's behind you?  Damn it.  I'm not whining.  I'm just saying.  Now, people know you're selling tickets.  I'm really busting your balls.  It's going to be good.  I know what your stupid hair do.  Just shut up.  Was that doctor a barber, too, at the same time? 
[02:17:00]  Root canal and a trim, you jackass.  There's nothing wrong with Vinny's haircut.  If you're on a stage singing,  Put me on the reds.  There's nothing wrong with that.  You really do have a head head.  I can't believe I'm watching a fucking dying black man  give him dental advice,  and you give me hair advice.  What is upside down about this fucking world?  You have no head to speak of.  God almighty.  Before you insult me,  can you just pick up a receiver? 
[02:17:30]  It says unless you pretend you're a cop.  Hey, Norton, Leobald.  Here's two free tickets.  Y'all ready to laugh?  732-545-4242 for tickets.  Thank you, Jim.  Ha ha.  Stress factor.  Yeah, stress factor.  It's going to be good.  It's going to be very good.  We have a very special...  Yeah, sounds convincing, Vinny.  No, let me tell you something.  It's actually...  It's a good show.  Big J is also very fucking funny.  Yes, J is.  He killed last night. 
[02:18:00]  J. Ogerson is a very funny dude.  As much as I find him annoying offstage  with his awful fat face and smoking habits.  Between J and Patrice,  this is the fattest show I've ever been.  I'm really scared of the food bill this night.  I can't eat food at your place, Nomoto, Vin.  It's a wrap.  You can.  No.  You even fry your lettuce.  Ha ha ha.  Give me a fried Greek cheese.  Give me a fried...  A fried Caesar salad. 
[02:18:30]  Vinny dips his Caesar salad in flour.  Ha ha ha.  Ain't right.  Ain't right with the senate on my phone.  You're cutting below the belt right there.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Folks, it's the delicious fried Caesar salad.  He takes pride in his food there, Patrice.  Please.  What'd I miss?  We've just been doing this for an hour.  We gave up on the show, I think, at 8.30.  Anthony's a trooper.  Another hour of Betty Davis mouth over here. 
[02:19:00]  Jesus Christ.  I can't feel this thing.  I know I'm just going to wrench down on my tongue and have to go to the emergency room.  Did he give you pills, like, some pills for today?  No, I've got to go fill a prescription.  But that'll...  Will that stay right for you until the end of the show, at least?  Uh, yes.  Let's ask him.  That's all they say.  Thanks, old son.  What was that thing Mary Poppins said?  Yeah.  Supercalifragilisticexialidocious.  Maybe I should come back and sit in that chair.  Because you really can't contribute to it. 
[02:19:30]  I really can't do shit.  Oh, man.  Where's Bonnie?  Where's Bonnie?  That's Bonnie.  My fiancé.  My kind of lover.  That fucking worm Voss.  We were doing Albany together, and that phone rang 30 times, and that cocksucker picked it up every time.  He's...  He's...  He has changed.  Voss has changed, man.  We've seen it.  We've seen it.  But he changed...  You know what?  He changed her.  You know her?  Yeah.  He's changed her, too, man.  Really?  It's not just like Voss is in love.  They're both in this weird love. 
[02:20:00]  And I think because they're both degenerates, and this is their first time that they've been loving to another human being.  And they're just losing their lives.  They're really running with him.  I can't wait until she dumps him.  She's got to wait for some more change.  She's got to wait for Voss to make her funny.  He would be heartbroken.  What I can't wait is until they fire him from the show they have together.  They keep her.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And she'll have to go, look, I love you, but I have to think of myself, too.  It's for us.  I'll do it for us.  I tell you, I gave...  I thought it's lasted a long time so far. 
[02:20:30]  I thought it'd be over, but, you know.  No.  I'll be there to pick him up.  Don't worry, Vossy.  All his friends.  I don't know Bonnie that well, but Voss is in love.  He really is in love.  Voss is really in love.  It makes me sick.  Oh, it's awful.  But he's 57.  He's got his credit just cleared up.  He bought his first house connected to another house.  He bought his first town, I own my townhouse apartment.  Siamese home fucking zilch. 
[02:21:00]  Get out of here.  Get someone with a yard, you're 80.  Jesus Christ, with your rented home that you disguised as owners, you idiot.  Now, there's wheels on it in case I want to move it.  Anybody want to buy my Rolex?  Oh, you jerk off.  He's all happy he just got credit at 57.  Just got it.  First love and first go.  Voss is out of high school.  He's 42 years removed from everything.  He's the only guy that had his children co-signed for a Santa. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, date of birth of co-signee, 86.  One, four, 86.  I'm going to ask Bonnie to wear my pin.  Will you marry me?  As he bought her a second-hand wedding ring.  Not a good deal.  He makes me sick.  Did you hear his awful proposal story?  It was in a Best Western, like near Newark Airport. 
[02:22:00]  They flew it.  Oh, it's fucking...  After eating out of the diner.  George Steinberg was more romantic than he was fucking chaining Little Lisa to the thing  and punching her head in the throat.  Did you hear what he said to her?  Did you hear what he handed her to the box and said...  He turned around and walked away and said,  You can say no if you want to.  How fucking sad.  How fucking unbelievably sad.  You think he was the same size kneeling down as going to marry his boy standing up?  Little fingers putting the ring on.  Oh, the awful hands. 
[02:22:30]  She probably jumped twice before she...  Oh, all right, I do.  Just don't touch me no more.  All right, all right.  Yes.  He has awful acclimation hands.  They don't bend.  Take doll fingers.  Just leave the ring on the pillow.  I'll grab it.  I can't wait until Bonnie leaves them.  I just can't wait.  All curled up in the shower and washing off.  Trying to hold his face with his little Davy and Goliath fingers.  Back to the pipe.  Back to gambling.  Back to booze. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, I cannot wait until Vals is back.  Put him right over the top.  Oh, sells his house for a...  Sells his house for a hit.  Sells that connected to another house.  Mansion.  Hey, Patrice, I think I found out why people don't like you.  You're not nice.  You're not a fucking nice guy.  You don't have a nice thing going on.  One of my favorite tough crowd moments was awful Patrice.  Jeff Garland was on the show.  And Jeff said some joke that just bombed.  And Patrice was like, you're on a fucking improv show and that's the funniest thing you can say. 
[02:23:30]  And Jeff just spoke out and goes, what are you going to fucking bust my balls?  Oh, I hate that Fred Flintstone head.  He doesn't really bust my balls.  Every time I see his smarmy giant head.  Makes me want to try to get candy out of it.  That fat...  Hit it with a broomstick.  He's going to curb your enthusiasm.  Really?  Oh.  That makes me laugh about as much as a lamp.  I've never seen it.  I've never seen the show.  By mistake, I think. 
[02:24:00]  Is it overrated?  There's nothing working except for HBO.  Is it overrated?  Oh, whatever, man.  You know, you can't even talk about certain things in your career.  People are like, oh, it's a curb.  I've never seen it.  Whatever.  That moon head.  I like to shove his head right in the toilet like Mickey Rourke.  Did you get to the...  I can't even say it.  Oh, the trainable?  No.  Trainable?  Well, we can do that.  We have to end the week by getting rid of this.  The trainable audio.  And don't play the ones we've heard.  No, we've got four that we haven't played yet. 
[02:24:30]  But first, I mean, Patrice O'Neal is going to be playing Vinny's Club this weekend.  Stress Factor.  What's the number again there, Jimmy?  And I like the way Vinny did this because what happens is you incorporate part of the mood into the phone number.  Which I thought was just a super idea.  It's 732-545.  Ha, ha.  That's like a hospital going, call us at 1743.  Ow, ow. 
[02:25:00]  1-800.  That's.  And leave off the last tumor for savings.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  It's 545-4242.  But that comes in a ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  That is absolutely fantastic.  What a coincidence.  Yeah.  I paid extra for that.  Yeah, and he fought hard for that.  We said, well, we got giggle, giggle.  Do you want that one? 
[02:25:30]  No.  No.  It's got to be ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Oh, you're fucking stupid.  I can waste too many numbers.  Hey, when Keith Robinson works, do you have to change it to 545-ZZZZ?  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, man.  That's another black guy I use.  Two and a half.  Two and a half.  Two and a half black guys work.  Oh, they're doing, oh, this, I love this.  I'm in the stress factor.  I stopped by this and I'm pissing.  And I look on the wall and they have advertisers for shows coming up. 
[02:26:00]  And Vinny and Keith Robinson are doing a Father's Day show.  What's it called?  Father's Day in black and white.  Father's Day in black and white, yeah.  Like one black guy, one white guy.  You know, both dads.  Probably different points of view.  Ha, ha, ha.  And fucking Keith's credits.  Because this fucking finished idiot.  Hammer it, you fucking moron.  Hammer it.  Next Thursday.  Keith.  I've already sold more seats than you, you cocksucker.  It's a great.  I have a fucking 150 on the book for Thursday.  Oh.  That's a great show.  Thank you.  But Keith's credits on that fucking wall, I wanted to throw that paper into the urinal. 
[02:26:30]  He said he was on Star Search a couple of years ago.  A couple of years ago?  Did he really say that?  Yes.  Yeah.  Like Keith is this up and comer.  Keith is 46 years old.  It's the new one on PAX.  That's what he's talking about.  We still have a headshot that says Pudge him on it.  Fucking Keith's first sets now are on the Game Show Network.  He is fucking an old Finnish man.  He really is an old man now.  That credit list is awful.  You look at all these impressive credits and then you realize, oh, those are the people 
[02:27:00]  he's open for.  I told you, every time he's on stage, after he finishes a joke, he reintroduces himself.  He's a big emcee.  That's brutal.  That's brutal.  Anthony, you all right over there?  Oh, yeah.  Look at his kid just wiggling his tongue around him.  It's like stroke face.  And the worst part is, I know it's going to wear off.  And the pain will come back. 
[02:27:30]  How long did he say it would stay?  Two hours.  At least until you get to the other place, right?  You go to the other dentist, right?  Yeah, but that wears off, too.  I got it.  Yeah, but when there's no nerve, man, if they get the nerve out, you can't feel anything.  It's not going to exist.  The pain is going to be gone.  I think the penicillin's got to kick in.  You get pain medication, though, from the other place.  They'll prescribe something.  You'll be fine, man.  You'll be fine, man.  You'll be fine.  Tell him to take that nerve out, Anthony.  Get it out.  And then you'll be like, out.  Out.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, what's up, buddy? 
[02:28:00]  Not much.  I'm wondering if Jimmy Norton, when you call her a hoker, do you call 1-800-HO-HO?  I wouldn't have mind...  I wouldn't have minded so much if you didn't call her a hoker, you fucking idiot.  A hoker.  A hoker.  A hoker.  Are you a hoker?  I just thought I was doing great.  Oh, that poor guy was waiting for hours.  Oh, he was.  I'm going to crack them all up.  They're going to love this.  I smell dead people. 
[02:28:30]  I farted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Susie Essman.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  How much worse can it get?  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  I haven't heard it said yet.  New Orleans is like a bowl.  In case you didn't do that.  Enough with the bowl.  Wasn't there some kind of a levy?  Like some guy drove a Chevy to it and it was dry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some good old boys down there drinking something.  My hat blew off and then he came in my eye. 
[02:29:00]  Fucking dumb song.  Dude, it means Elvis.  Yeah, it does it.  We should do Wacky Radio today and just play songs with the word levy.  With the word levy in it.  Did he fuck that up?  It means Elvis.  Elvis.  Whatever it means.  I don't even...  That shows you what I know.  And the Martian band refused...  Did they stop marching?  Eight minute song?  We get it.  When that song comes on, I cannot change it quickly enough.  It's like long...  Get it?  Yeah.  A long... 
[02:29:30]  They took the last train from...  Really?  And then like ten minutes later you think you're safe.  You go back.  Bye, bye, Mrs. Shut Up.  I understand Steve is panicking because he heard down in New Orleans that the honey jars  had been blown off the shelves.  The fire ants have stolen his shirts.  I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. 
[02:30:00]  Well, I'll tell you all about it in real time right now.  I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy.  I'd see that gift in Ben's pants.  The song's longer than the Edmund Fitzgerald.  With every paper I'd deliver, bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step.  Okay, so the paper got delivered and it was bad news. 
[02:30:30]  I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride.  Whose widowed bride?  Something touched me deep inside the day the music died.  And here we go.  Whose widowed bride?  Buddy Holly.  Frankenstein.  Oh, bye, bye, Miss America.  Who's she?  I don't know.  I went to the levee. 
[02:31:00]  Why?  Was it dry?  Good old boys.  Because they cried so much, there were no more tears left, I think.  Oh, why was the good old boys drinking?  Why?  Why are they drinking saying that if the levee's dry?  Exactly.  No threat.  Why would he take a Chevy to it?  This guy's a real cock.  Take your Chevy into a ditch.  Drunk driving.  Fucking rat.  How do you believe in rock and roll? 
[02:31:30]  All right, we get it.  Right.  We get it.  It was a big day.  Yeah, we know.  It's stuck.  Well, I know that you're in love.  Why don't you write a song called Fly Commercial, you chintzy jizzbags?  Presumptuous ass that someone would want to sit through a song this long. 
[02:32:00]  What?  Rock and buck.  Six minutes left.  And you'll hear every minute here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's right.  Better than playing commercials.  Goodbye, goodbye, Miss American Pie.  Bye.  Bye, everybody.  Why?  Stop it.  Okay, terrific.  Stop it.  And Ben came in and said,  No, it's something, boss, I did something.  What? 
[02:32:30]  Kevin and Jerry, go ahead.  What's up, man?  I got a funny little ISO, guys.  Yeah?  It is actually jail case with old pride.  Yeah?  I actually, that's the first thing I thought of was when he was thinking about Jackie Onassis or Jackie Kennedy.  When the Jester sang for the king and queen.  My first song was Jackie Kennedy.  Who's the Jester?  I don't know.  Who's the king and queen?  I don't know.  James Dean.  I know there's a whole website that explains every single line of the goddamn song. 
[02:33:00]  If one more person sends me the hidden meanings to The Shining, it's fucking wrong.  Of course it is.  Nonsense.  Stop looking for shit.  Kubrick was a genius, but he didn't go that deep.  Are we done with this song?  Does it get any?  No, I want to hear more opening.  No.  No.  And while Lennon read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park, and we sang dirges in  the dark the day the music died.  What does that mean?  I think it's about the Kennedy assassination. 
[02:33:30]  Well, I want to hear more of that song.  What happened to this?  Let's say hi to Kenny in South Carolina.  Kenny.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Kenny's the comedian around here.  What's up, Kenny?  I'm going to tell you, you're missing the obvious Levy song.  Are you?  When the Levy Breaks by Led Zeppelin.  Well, I was thinking we could just play Levy songs all day.  Or clips of Bob Levy.  He's funny.  All right.  What's going on, guys?  When the Levy Breaks, right? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, that's the Manson thing, right?  I see.  Maybe the music died when JFK was shot because everything changed, and maybe he's going through  other things that happened.  Because it was a marching band that kind of wouldn't yield.  He's got a fill eight minutes, though. 
[02:34:30]  Is he talking about the 60s?  I'm thinking he did.  Yeah.  But why wouldn't the marching band stop?  It's all about the music of the time.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's what it is, and how rock and roll changed after Buddy Holly's plane crashed.  Yeah.  It got better.  Of course it did.  I like Buddy Holly, you know, but come on.  You did?  The big bopper?  Who gave a shit about it?  Bob?  Hello, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, Chantilly Lays.  Shut up.  We're too low, baby. 
[02:35:00]  Shouldn't fly in the snow, baby.  Chantilly Lays.  Fuselage in my face.  Shut your big bopper face, stupid.  Have a seat cushion in the mouth.  Hello, baby.  Yeah, this is the big bopper speaking.  Oh, sweet boy. 
[02:35:30]  Do I want?  Will I want?  You're not clear for landing.  Could you shut that guy up and listen to the air traffic controller?  Chantilly Lays and a booty face.  And a ponytail.  We're plummeting down.  Mike in Oklahoma.  Hello?  Hey, Mike.  Yes, why is this funny that people are going to die in New Orleans?  We're not, we're making fun of the, first of all.  Goddamn, how are we supposed to do a show when the goddamn death dedication, people dying? 
[02:36:00]  We're making fun of the news coverage and the panic of the news coverage.  And the reality is we don't know them.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter if you don't know them.  Dude, how do you, how do you not get, dude, how do you.  Mike, people die every single day.  Yes.  Yes, people die every single day.  And I bet a lot of people you hang out with die more often than that, judging by your voice.  Go visit, go visit a friend with a poodle recently, have you?  Ah, yes, yes, that's hilarious. 
[02:36:30]  Yes, it is.  Oklahoma, huh?  How's it going in Oklahoma today?  It was fine until you start making fun.  We're making fun of what?  What did we say specifically?  Hold on, hold on.  What did we say specifically about either people dying or the hurricane that offended you and  thought we were making fun of people dying?  I don't know.  Maybe, like, the whole last 45 minutes of your show?  What, what, no, specifically.  What was the thing we said?  What was the thing?  You're playing when the levy breaks and it's... 
[02:37:00]  No, we played Bye Bye Miss American Pie and we talked about how much the song stinks.  And the news coverage and how they try to panic you and MSNBC was the only one doing it accurately  and actually reporting what was going on.  You know, they're not panicking anybody.  Yes, they are.  Yes, they are.  I think these...  They've hyped this like a movie.  Yeah, they're doing a disservice to the rest of the country, you know, putting the fear  in all of this.  Absolutely.  And I don't mean...  I'm not like...  And that's what we're pointing out.  Yes.  They basically said last night on TV that New Orleans would be no more. 
[02:37:30]  Yes.  It wouldn't exist after today.  So, like, I understand that you and your faggot voice, you kind of...  You hear this...  Oh, me and my...  Excuse me?  You kind of have a little bit of a faggot voice.  And I understand that you hear this and you shoot for the pink team, don't you?  Excuse me, Mr. Monster Rain.  Exactly.  Me and my faggot voice, okay.  Boy, you listen to this show a lot, don't you?  Wow.  Good boy.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  You picked the one thing that really turned him on.  I've never had dick in my mouth.  How about you, Norton?  Well, you probably took it right in your keister, didn't you, little fella?  Why waste time in the mouth when you can be in there pushing stool? 
[02:38:00]  The mouth is a waste of time, you silly goose.  Shove it in my ass so I can go, ooh, ah.  You are laughing at people dying.  No, I'm laughing at your faggoty voice.  You do have a faggot voice, and I don't mean any disrespect by that.  But you have to admit, people have questioned your sexuality by your voice.  Yeah.  How many times has that happened?  Many times.  Yeah.  So why would I say that you get to face a good man?  But I'm a faggot.  I'm a faggot, and I'm proud.  And you've never had a dick in your mouth?  You just lied.  No, I've never had dick in my mouth. 
[02:38:30]  What kind of faggot doesn't have dick in his mouth?  A good faggot.  See?  No.  A bad faggot.  You're not a good faggot.  A good faggot has a dick in his mouth.  Matter of fact, a good faggot has one in each hand and one on the chin.  A good faggot puts his dick in a mouth.  No.  No.  No, sir.  You never reciprocated once in your life?  Selfish, little greedy man.  Yeah, exactly.  It's all about you.  It is.  And I like it like that.  All right.  Well, this call turned hot quickly.  Jesus.  No. 
[02:39:00]  You know what?  Now it's about faggot.  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  Do you want to kiss me on the mouth?  Yeah.  I'll stick my hard cock in your mouth.  You want to feel it?  Hello.  You want to feel it?  Just a fuck face?  Stop calling me that.  All right.  Do you want to kiss me?  Mike, uh.  I want to kiss you on the mouth.  Mike was getting us some juicy stuff there, Ope.  He's still there, Mike.  Hello?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'm still here, and you still haven't properly defended yourself about laughing about people 
[02:39:30]  dying.  Yes, we did.  We did.  And the bottom line is...  There's going to be crocodiles and alligators roaming around the streets, biting people.  All right.  We get you now.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Is the song still going on, you think?  This is March.  Oh.  Oh, the marching band refused to yield.  Hey, how come you guys are making fun of people who sang Shantilly Lake?  Shut up.  The marching band was that important?  You know, we were talking about MSNBC doing a good job in their coverage. 
[02:40:00]  Did you hear what they were saying?  We hear that there are some problems with the Superdome.  Everybody's okay.  Nothing to panic about.  No big deal.  MSNBC was doing it right.  Fox and CNN are like, the whole world's coming down.  Fire ants and corpses and everything's going to crap.  Fox.  And did you notice, by the way, in the Big Bobber song, Shantilly Lace, bring me Ramone, bring  me some Shantilly Lace.  Oh, Ramone, you know what I like. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, good times.  You guys want some other news other than the hurricane?  All right.  But February made me shiver.  Buddy Holly died on February 3rd, 1959, in a plane crash in Iowa during a snowstorm.  The news came to most of the world on the morning of February 3rd, which is why it's known  as the day the music died. 
[02:41:00]  I never have come across a February 3rd.  With every paper I'd deliver, Don McClain's only job besides being a full-time songwriter  was being a paper boy.  Caddy at the Crescent Club?  No?  Yeah.  Air traffic control?  What'd the little lad do?  Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye, singing, that'll, this'll be the day  that I die.  This'll be the day that I die.  Well, one of Holly's hits was, that'll be the day. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  The chorus contains the line, that'll be the day that I die.  When you say goodbye, that'll be the day.  By the way, dude, you missed this right here.  Oh.  You have to, there's a line up here, because, where the hell is it?  It's a line here about, see this I didn't see.  Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step.  I can't remember if I cried.  And there was an explanation.  Yeah.  When I read about his widowed bride, see Holly's recent bride, Maria Elena. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, this is terrible.  Was pregnant when the crash took place and she miscarried.  Well, I know you're in love with him, because I saw you dancing in the gym.  Slow dancing could just be dancing, or it could be vertical making out.  It wasn't hard to watch a couple slow dancing and figure out whether they had some sort of  relationship, if you knew anything about slow dancing.  God. 
[02:42:30]  You guys want to know any more?  No.  Yes.  This is great.  Where are you?  Because there's a levy in New Orleans?  But that's not how it used to be, when the jester sang for the king and queen.  We asked about that one.  Well, the jester is Bob Dylan.  What?  As will become clear later, there are several interpretations of king and queen.  Some think that Elvis Presley is the king, which seems pretty obvious.  The queen is said to be either Connie Francis or Little Richard. 
[02:43:00]  If he's singing about Connie Francis, I'll put a bullet in his face.  If he's actually put Connie Francis on the rock song.  An alternate interpretation is that this refers to the Kennedys, the king and queen of Camelot,  who were present at a Washington, D.C. civil rights rally featuring Martin Luther King.  Camelot.  You almost tripped up his name there.  I know.  Oh, and while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown.  This could be a reference to Elvis' decline and Dylan's ascendance. 
[02:43:30]  The thorny crown might be a reference to the price of fame.  Dylan has said that he wanted to be as famous as Elvis, one of his early idols.  How about this?  Somebody says to Don McLean,  Hey, faggot, what's that song about?  Oh, it's a whole thing.  Pumps failing, pumps failing in New Orleans.  Pumps are failing.  Just came up on Fox News.  Structural damage throughout New Orleans. 
[02:44:00]  Oh my God, there's another one.  Due to the high winds, comb sales are up 2,000%.  Let's see the song.  Oh, God, stop.  All right, wait, I've got to look at that one.  What was that one again?  Breaking Satan's Spell.  Satan's Spell.  Something about Satan's Spell.  Satan's Spell.  He's talking about Ozzy. 
[02:44:30]  All out shelters, yield.  Oh, well, that's too long of an explanation.  Friends, Satan.  Okay, and as I watched him on the stage,  my hands were clenched in fists of rage.  Which voice?  No.  Tiny hands.  Angel born in hell could break that Satan's Spell.  While playing a concert at the Altamont Speedway in 1968,  the Stones appointed members of the Hells Angels to work security.  Stop.  On the advice of the Grateful Dead.  In the darkness near the front of the stage, 
[02:45:00]  a young man named Meredith Hunter was beaten and stabbed to death by the angel.  Oh!  Oh!  Public outcry that the song Sympathy for the Devil had somehow inside the violence  caused the Stones to drop the song from their show for the next six years.  This incident is chronicled in the documentary film Gimme Shelter.  Goes on and on.  All right.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:45:30]  Time just stinks.  No one beats time.  It doesn't matter who you are and what you do.  Time blows and wins in the end.  Which workbook?  We're going to the New York Post page 23.  CBGB's is closing, Anthony.  Care.  They're making a big deal about it here in New York because a lot of bands, of course,  got their start.  Yeah, CBGB's.  Not that big a deal, though.  Doesn't matter what city you walk around in. 
[02:46:00]  That cool, hip guy has to have his CBGB shirt on.  We get it.  We get it.  You're a rebel.  What a guy.  You're a rebel.  If it's 1977.  We should really start talking about the stupid T-shirts out there.  One of them is the CBGB shirts you see everywhere.  Yeah.  The other shirt you see everywhere is that dumb black dog.  Which one?  Black dog?  Yeah, black dog.  It's a T-shirt company in what, Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard? 
[02:46:30]  It's the black dog.  Someone help me here.  I'm the only one who's seen the black dog T-shirt.  I don't know that one.  Martha's Vineyard.  Thank you, fan.  You haven't seen the black dog T-shirts there everywhere, too?  Well, I was only at the Vineyard a month ago, so I don't...  No, it's not just a Vineyard thing.  I guarantee we can walk around New York within a half hour, we'll see a black dog T-shirt.  Oh, T-shirt.  Yes.  The ones I hate the most are those fucking Che Guevara shirts or whatever his name was. 
[02:47:00]  Enough already.  Yeah, you don't like that?  Ah, I'm fucking right already with them.  Everyone has one.  We know.  We know.  Oh, he was this.  He was a right.  I hate them.  I don't have Sabbath shirts.  And, of course, fat girls wearing the sexy shirts with cute little sayings.  Juicy.  Well, juicy comes to mind, but now there's just a million of them.  Yeah.  Hot stuff.  Really?  Sex kitten.  Every fat girl should wear a shirt, and it should be white in the front and black on the back, 
[02:47:30]  and it should have a blowhole in it.  That's what every fat girl should be forced to wear.  Just walk around and flip-flop, dress like a killer whale.  We throw fish at you, fat face.  That would prove you have a sense of humor.  All right.  Moving on to other things.  Who hung up on you?  Well, we were talking about t-shirts, and a guy was going to make a comment that a t-shirt  he's sick of is black people wearing the Scarface t-shirt.  Yeah.  That is a very popular one.  That's a biggie.  That's very, very popular these days. 
[02:48:00]  So he had a great observation, but I guess he couldn't wait any longer.  Those Von Dutch shirts made me want to bury an axe in someone's forehead, too.  Yeah, like the trucker hats, but they're pink and lime green with Von Dutch on them,  and they're like $100 a piece or something ridiculous.  And the shirt, and Bob Kelly has a couple of them.  A stupid, you're not stylish.  Oh, no.  And on his big, awful body, it's Von Dutch.  One word per side.  Let's say hi to Jim in Tennessee. 
[02:48:30]  Hey.  What's up, Jim?  Not too much.  What about the guys who were wearing the independent t-shirts?  I never saw that.  Independent.  Yeah, help us out.  It's just one word on a t-shirt that says independent.  Really?  I didn't see that one.  Sorry.  I will say.  I'm sick of just shirts with sayings.  Guys in general.  I saw one the other day.  I'm a talent coordinator. 
[02:49:00]  Ugh.  That.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Kev's wearing an Echo Unlimited shirt, which I've never seen before, but I'm tired of Echo Unlimited as a brand.  I'm tired of Sean John.  Yeah.  All that shit.  Enough already.  Put on a Kiss t-shirt.  Be a man already.  John in Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, what up, boys?  Hey.  Yeah.  I just bought a t-shirt the other day.  It's the funniest thing.  It says 124 out of 125 teenagers say Viva Aruba. 
[02:49:30]  Think about it for a second.  That's pretty funny, actually.  Yeah.  That's very funny.  That is funny.  Norton sucked his dick.  That is pretty funny, actually.  I like your shirt.  Why'd you have to make a hurtful comment?  Yeah.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris.  Yeah.  You can explain the independent shirts.  Go.  Yeah, I can.  It's a skateboard company, Independent Trucks.  Oh, but you should have known that.  And everybody just started wearing them to be posers, so.  You're at the skateboard shack.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's it. 
[02:50:00]  Let's say hi to Matt in Boston.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, guys.  I hate that Vote for Pedro shirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like people see it on each other, and they can relate.  That was their losers, and they hate this loser freaking movie.  See, the first time I saw a Vote for Pedro shirt, it made me laugh, because I like Napoleon  Dynamite, but you're right.  Now it's everywhere.  Hey, Jay.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, Ovi.  Bill in Boston.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey, how about those Hard Rock Cafe t-shirts? 
[02:50:30]  Awful.  Yeah, terrible.  Hey, stay out of room 237.  It's kind of cute, though, when it says Hard Rock Tokyo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You aren't there.  Shut up.  I'd like to know where they're from, though.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Hard Rock Vegas.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I was the worst with t-shirts years ago.  I'd get the t-shirts that would get, like, dated in two seconds.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  Like, I was the one with the Ren and Stimpy shirt.  Oh, really?  And then, you know, a little while later, you put it on, you're like, no one's even watching 
[02:51:00]  Ren and Stimpy anymore.  Those stupid, like, sayings.  Where's the beef?  Oh.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  You did not.  I think I might have had that one.  You did not.  Oh, just the worst.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  What an ass.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  That's awful.  Yeah.  And I can't even look for it.  How hard is that?  I'm doing the rest of the show looking this way. 
[02:51:30]  I'm sure that won't be a photo shot.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  Rambo is hot.  Lebanon was hot.  Holy shit.  A month later, you're an idiot.  Conglomerated mango shirt.  Well, we started a little something here.  Let's go to Joe in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Joe.  Yeah, I'm sick of Iron Crosses on shirts.  I'm a biker myself, but I'm sick of it.  Everybody's, uh...  Oh, West Coast Chopper and... 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, not just West Coast Chopper, but all bike companies are, you know, using it now.  It's a little overplayed by...  Yeah, the Iron Cross.  Go with the swastika, I say.  That's what I'm talking about.  Let's pop that on a T-shirt.  You probably could correct.  Use the right thing.  You want to get attention.  Why are you putting things on your T-shirt?  To get attention.  So people look and go, oh, you get some kind of reaction.  They'll be wearing Harley shirts, too.  Put the old twisted cross on there.  I have a really...  Hey, Tim, you coming to Connecticut?  Nah, sir, not for a while.  I have a really cool shirt, actually. 
[02:52:30]  It says, uh, co-ed naked volleyball.  Oh, is that a scream?  Oh, the co-ed naked shirts.  I forgot about those.  They're fucking terrible.  And they have one for every sport.  And every one of them is fucking terrible.  You know what would be cool if it had a picture of JonBenet, and it said, co-ed naked murdering.  Can you just say, repeat after me, say terrible two more times?  No.  Please. 
[02:53:00]  Terrible.  No, say terrible.  Terrible!  Say it the right way.  Terrible!  Say it the right way.  It's the terriblest!  Why can't you ever play along?  Terrible!  Because I know henchmen will do a little thing with the word terrible now, like you did with phenomenal.  All right.  I'll do it.  Terrible!  Terrible!  There you go.  Thank you.  All right.  How about this shirt?  Let's say hi to Chris in Philly.  Go ahead, Chris. 
[02:53:30]  Chris?  Hey, I was in the mall the other day.  I saw one of those trendy goops wearing a sex ed honor student t-shirt.  Oh, that's great.  He's getting his sexual education.  The no fear t-shirt.  Those are another old one.  Yeah.  Dude, when I see those on like those fucking annoying trucks down the shore with that little,  like the guy that looks like the Hawaiian punch guy hair on that no fear, I want a drunken truck driver just to smash into them. 
[02:54:00]  Or the other guy, the little cartoon guy pissing on the Ford emblem.  Calvin.  Yeah, Calvin pissing on Ford.  Yeah, I'm a Chevy guy.  No fear.  Should after the drunk driving accident, it should be no movement below the neck.  All right.  Jesus, don't encourage him, angry little fella.  Go ahead, angry little fella.  What's up, bu-bu-bu-bu-boy?  Hello.  You know what grinds my gears is when I see people wearing a misfit shirt with the logo, 
[02:54:30]  and they have no concept of the band or who they are.  Absolutely right.  Whether they own an album or not.  Very good.  Bunch it out.  I hate when girls wear shirts that say porn star.  Yeah.  Because you're cockteasers, you're not porn stars.  Yeah.  They got all these 14 years old, too.  Exactly.  Provocative t-shirts, and they don't want you to comment on them.  Yeah, hot topic shirts.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  Good morning, bu-bu-bu-boys.  Hi.  I saw a t-shirt on Sunday. 
[02:55:00]  A guy was walking.  The t-shirt said, don't piss me off.  I'm running out of places to bury the bodies.  I would just laugh for hours.  And by the way, my wife wears one of those juicy shirts that says hot bottoms.  Hot bottoms?  Yeah.  And how hot is her bottom, sir?  She's pretty good.  She's about 115, about 5'7".  All right.  There you go.  She's a hot bottom.  You know what shirt I really like?  I like, I saw a pregnant woman with a shirt, and right over the stomach it said, 
[02:55:30]  this is a fine place for a foot.  All right.  Roger in Mississippi.  Go ahead, Roger.  Who doesn't still laugh when you say, I'm with stupid, and the arrow, and you're next  to the guy.  Come on now.  That's hysterical.  But the best one, I've got this one.  I actually have one black one and one white one.  It's his FBI female body inspector.  Oh, see?  Now that's funny. 
[02:56:00]  Let's say hi to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony.  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hi.  How about...  I'm doing Jimmy's video.  I'm not as pink as you drunk, I am.  That's a great one.  That's a good one.  I'll talk to you guys.  Punch it out.  What is that other one about sex, being bad for your vision, and all the letters are blurry  that say it, and you're looking and go, whoa, I can't see.  Oh, I get it.  I have a cool one with just John Lennon wearing a New York City shirt. 
[02:56:30]  That's great.  That is a tribute.  Todd in North Carolina.  Hey, what do you say there, guys?  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys have been to a t-shirt hell or rotten cotton dot com,  and seen, uh, I've got to keep the airplane.  You've seen that one?  It says, uh, my Mexican works for less money than your Mexican.  Ah.  Right.  It's horrible shit.  All right, sir.  You're punching out.  Thank you.  Please.  Let's say hi to Ryder in Virginia. 
[02:57:00]  Ryder?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's going on?  What's up?  I got a shirt for you.  All right.  All right.  It says, now hiring, apply below.  Now hiring, apply below.  Got an arrow pointing down.  Gotcha.  Of course it does.  Very good.  It's the dick joke.  All right, let's say hi to Jeremy.  Jeremy?  Where's Jeremy's money, you faggot?  Oh.  I got confused.  I forgot to send it in.  I was compartmentalizing and trying to shame mother. 
[02:57:30]  All right, sir.  What?  Jeremy, go.  Hey, I wanted to say something to old Jimmy Norton there.  That Shamu comment, man, you build yourself as kind of the...  Shamu?  Pervert's pervert.  You're into...  Yeah, you guys were talking about t-shirts.  You were saying the fat chicks should have the white on the front, the black, the blowhole  on the back.  It wasn't Shamu.  Orca or... 
[02:58:00]  Orca, yeah.  Whale in general.  Right.  Oh, come on, dude.  That was just funny.  So what's the point?  Well, the point is that you kind of build yourself as the pervert's pervert.  Or...  You know, you're into trannies and all this other fun crap.  I'm not at the tranny, sir.  You can't believe it.  Huh?  Go ahead.  Say what you guys are.  There's a lot of us out there that are kind into the big women.  Now, I'm not talking, you know, Jabba, huge.  I'm not talking, you know, pick a roll and fuck it, but...  Chubby chase.  Hey, when Jimmy said that comment about a shirt he wants to see, were you in your car with 
[02:58:30]  your wife and now you feel like you have to call in and defend her?  No, no.  I'm a trucker, man.  My wife's back in Missouri.  She doesn't have an XM.  She doesn't hear this shit.  It's not like I'm like, oh, hey, honey.  How much does your wife weigh, my friend?  How much does she weigh?  What does she tip the scales at?  And by that, I mean the scales you have to pull your truck on on the highway.  What does your wife weigh, sir, honestly?  Honestly, maybe 215.  Okay, so basically, I mean, I was just making a little bit of a weight joke, but you got 
[02:59:00]  kind of mad because, you know, there's a fat pig at home.  Oh, no.  See?  You've always been into the fatties?  Oh, well, you know, I like big kicks.  I like big ass.  It's just...  Sure.  How tall is she?  There's more there.  You know, like I said, you know, not...  You're looking at it going, which ones are the tits, because, oh, those are the ones with  the nipples on it.  That's just nasty.  No, dude, how tall is the slob? 
[02:59:30]  Oh, God, she's about 5'7".  Okay, that's 5'5", and she's 230.  And how much does she weigh when you married the young lady?  She hasn't gained that much.  She gained about, maybe 30 pounds.  That's a lot, bro.  Maybe a little bit more, but she lost a bunch, though.  How big did she actually get?  How big did she actually get?  Yeah, like you said, she lost a bunch.  When you've lost a bunch and you're down to 215, you were at one point, you were almost 
[03:00:00]  killable.  She was just under 200 when I married her.  All right.  What did you like about her when you first saw her?  She got up to maybe 245, maybe 250 right in there.  Yeah.  What did you like about her when you first met her?  She was smart, had a real pretty face.  To be brutally honest, she had a great set of dead.  Wait, so you said when she was brutally honest, did every time she'd take a bite, did she go, 
[03:00:30]  go away, bad childhood, go away, bad childhood?  No.  I'm supposed to get the fist off one here and I'm laughing.  No, really, she did not get big until she married her first husband.  It was, you know, she couldn't get out of it.  It was an abusive relationship.  What, are you going to put donuts on his fist and punch her in the mouth? 
[03:01:00]  But it was kind of a psychological thing, you know, she felt that she made herself big  that she'd be undesirable to him and he'd leave her.  Oh, that's the strategy.  She gets fat, the husband goes, oh, I'm leaving.  But she ended up leaving him anyway.  It didn't work.  But the big deal is, you know, Jim's a freak as far as all the different fun things he's into. 
[03:01:30]  There's somebody out there for him.  There's somebody that's going to say, my God, you're perfect, you know, because of all the fun things you're into.  I looked at my wife and said, damn, I've got to have it.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you date a lot growing up?  What's that?  Did you date a lot of girls growing up?  Are you a big fella yourself?  Um, I'm a truck driver.  I've got the standard trucker gut anymore, a little bit. 
[03:02:00]  But, yeah, I didn't, I wouldn't say, you know, son wanted, but I did a few going out.  How old were you when you got married, sir?  Sir, how old were you?  Oh, 21.  Oh, 21.  You were young.  Yep.  Yeah.  I see a lot of problems.  Yeah, this is brutal.  This is trouble.  Did you knock her up or something?  No.  Did you think she was already knocked up?  She came with twin five-year-old sons to begin with. 
[03:02:30]  What?  She came with twin five-year-old sons to begin with.  Yeah.  So you got an instant family at 21 years old?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She was 195 with two kids?  How many guys did you have to fight off?  Um, there was a little bit of competition there, but, uh...  Was there a bunch of...  Dude, was there a big, like, hanging bunt with stretch marks on it?  No.  No, man.  That would be in the Java category for me. 
[03:03:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Well, 195 is a big gal.  I mean, not to tease her, but that's a hefty gal.  You know, that's a big girl.  You're just into the bigger girls.  I mean, there's plenty of you out there.  It's chubby chaser.  Dude, absolutely.  Look, we all love our mommies, and none of us want mommy to leave, and a lot of times,  you know, we find somebody who won't leave us.  That's very understandable.  With a matronly figure.  My mom was a real little gal.  No, no, no.  It's not about the figure, sir.  It's about the idea of a mommy. 
[03:03:30]  It's about not wanting to be left or abandoned or left alone.  So you get somebody who will depend on us and not leave us.  You know, be a big fatso with two kids.  I mean, no disrespect.  I'm not speaking ill of your wife.  I'm sure she's lovely.  She sure isn't going anywhere, though.  Absolutely not.  Especially the stairs involved.  Did you have a...  What kind of childhood did you have?  Me?  Yeah.  Incredibly happy.  In fact, my wife and in-laws refer to my folks as the Cleavers.  Really?  Boy, that's got to be a lot of fun. 
[03:04:00]  What do they call her, Mr. Ed?  All right, sir.  All right, sir.  Oh, wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, Jeremy.  All right.  Are we done with Jeremy?  Yeah, he is all right.  All right.  Oh, I wanted to know if it was the Cleavers or the friend on the show, Lumpy.  Brian from Austin. 
[03:04:30]  Brian.  Where did you meet, Miss Arbuckle?  To kick him and his fat wife right down the steps.  Good karate kick to the spine.  Take that with some hot soup in your hand.  Opie Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na.  Na, na, na.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:05:00]  Let's say hi to Charles Ross.  One man Star Wars show.  How's it going, mister?  One man show.  Yeah, based on Star Wars.  Based on Star Wars.  It is Star Wars, essentially.  It's Star Wars.  That's all it is.  The definitive Star Wars.  I wouldn't say definitive.  I would say sort of the bastardization of it.  Bastardization.  Where do you do this?  Well, here I'm doing it in New York at the Lamb's Theater, which is 130 West 44th.  It's kind of weird, man.  Like, this is a comedy sketch that went really, really wrong.  Isn't it like Broadway over there?  Yeah, it is.  Well, it's considered off-Broadway. 
[03:05:30]  Off-Broadway.  And I'm definitely the most off thing on Broadway.  There's no...  So you're playing.  This is an off-Broadway show you're doing.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I got my licensing agreements and stuff like that.  So, I mean, I don't feel too bad about it.  Can you do it for us?  The whole thing?  Or just a piece of it?  The whole thing.  How long is it?  That's an hour.  Well, we've got about an hour left on the show.  An hour.  Can you cut the 54th?  Radio version.  I could do it, but I'd sweat all over the place and be positively disgusted.  What exactly is the theme of the show?  Well, okay.  Imagine you just take, you know, Star Wars and take all the tech out of it.  So it's just me doing, like, all the voices, all the, like, the music and stuff. 
[03:06:00]  It's kind of a dumb idea.  And it kind of is dumb for the first five minutes.  But I think people kind of dig it because people know Star Wars pretty well.  Do you get a lot of geeks in there?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  For sure.  There's a high geek sort of concentration.  Do you use props?  No.  No.  It's just you.  It's just me.  And your voice.  Yeah.  It's a really stupid idea.  But, I mean, I thought it was a dumb idea.  I will not argue with you.  Way to get people to buy tickets.  Do you have music that plays?  No.  It's just you.  Do you use a microphone or do you yell? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, I do use a microphone.  I mean, you and a mic.  Yeah.  Well, I've played it for, like, 3,500 people.  Just a...  No, no, no.  Underneath.  Underneath?  I wear a kiln.  Yeah.  You wear just regular clothes or is it...  No, no.  It's like a person that would work on an airplane, like a flight suit type thing.  Oh.  Just something really boring.  But it's black.  It's supposed to be really neutral.  And, yeah, once again, I never thought this idea would work.  But that was about three years ago, and I've been doing it ever since.  And who came up to you and said, this can be off-Broadway? 
[03:07:00]  Nobody.  Nobody.  It was actually...  I met this guy when I was touring it on this thing, the Fringe Tour, which, I mean, there's  American cities that do the Fringe, and there's Canadian cities.  I'm from Canada.  And now it makes perfect sense.  Now it makes perfect sense.  Now I was thinking, like, wait, wait, this is a little odd.  Canadian.  There was something in the water.  Right.  So do you feel like you've seen the new ones, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I've seen some of the old ones.  My friend watched the new ones, and he thinks that a lot of the technology and stuff has 
[03:07:30]  kind of surpassed a lot of what Lucas originally kind of intended to be, you know, like his  whole thing.  Like that space sort of cowboy western thing?  Well, I don't know, man.  I think the new things are made for new kids.  Like, you know, they're just made to...  I mean, they sell toys.  They get the kids to come out.  You know, they're sort of the helium-infused weird little character.  I don't know.  They're not up my alley, but when I was a kid and watched the old Star Wars films...  So you were a big fan? 
[03:08:00]  Oh, when I was a kid.  Yeah, absolutely.  What was your favorite part of the original?  The original?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  There was too many parts.  Actually, I really liked the evil guy, the Emperor.  I mean, I thought he was sort of like...  Oh, really?  Well, he's like the perfect...  Not many people pick that.  Really?  That guy.  I thought he was just like the perfect sarcastic bastard, and he was perfect.  Usually Vader, or, you know...  Yeah, I don't know.  He was cool, but, you know, it's kind of hard to believe that, you know, a guy with a voice  that cool could have given, or been sort of the seed of Luke, you know, the little whiny...  Yeah, I know. 
[03:08:30]  He's whined through the entire movie.  But if you watch the old films, or the new films now, you can see how much the Canadian guy  who plays Anakin Skywalker...  Yeah, he's a whiny bastard, too.  Now, obviously, you were a big fan, because you must have done the impressions.  Yeah.  Do you do the good impressions of this?  I wouldn't say there are good impressions, but some of them are good impressions.  Some of them are good.  Some of them aren't so good, like Yoda sucks, but whereas Admiral Ackbar, do you know what  I'm talking about?  Yeah, the fish-eyed guy.  Yeah, that's him, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I do a pretty good version of that, which is kind of cool, because today  I got an audition for a Star Wars video game. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Only through being in New York could you possibly get an audition to do a Star Wars video game,  where they actually need an Admiral Ackbar.  And what about some of the sound effects?  Obviously, the lightsaber would be a big one.  I mean, it sounds really dumb.  Absolutely.  No, it sounds kind of cool.  But the point is that you get into the context of the show, right?  And, like, how is it going to work?  Is it going to work or not going to work?  Yeah.  And, I mean, I can give you guys, like, a two-minute bit from the show if you want.  Absolutely.  Yeah?  I'd love to hear it. 
[03:09:30]  Okay, this here is the trash compactor scene from the first film, and just bear with me.  Should I watch or kind of shut my eyes and imagine?  Oh, let's all imagine.  You want us all imagine?  Okay, audience, even if you're driving, shut your eyes.  No, well, let's see here.  I'll stand up.  Can I move the next one?  Yeah, you should stand up.  Oh, yeah.  And, of course, we want the listeners to comment, serious comments about...  Serious.  Yes.  We've got a lot of clowns that want to call in, but we want serious comments only.  Charles Ross, the one-man Star Wars show.  Here's the scene.  Get behind me!  Get behind me!  This is some rescue.  You got in here.  Didn't you have a plan for getting out? 
[03:10:00]  Well, he's the brain, sweetheart.  What the hell are you doing?  Something has to save us kids.  In the garbage soup, fly boy.  Can they be big, will you?  I don't care what you smell.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Wonderful girl.  I'm going to kill her and begin to like her.  Get in there.  Ah, the garbage chute.  What a wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you discovered. 
[03:10:30]  Well, it could be worse.  It's worse.  There's something alive in here.  Something just swam past my leg.  Look, did you see that?  Kid!  Luke!  Kid!  Luke!  Blessed will you have my guns jammed!  Where?  Anywhere!  Kid!  Luke!  Kid!  Luke! 
[03:11:00]  Grab him!  What happened?  I don't know.  Just let go of me and disappeared.  The walls are closing in.  Don't you stand there?  Try to brace him or something.  Wait a minute.  3PO?  Come here, 3PO!  3PO!  3PO!  Oh, where could he be?  3PO!  3PO!  Are you there, sir? 
[03:11:30]  3PO!  We've had some problems.  Will you shut him, Mr. Me?  Shut down all the garbage smashes on the detention level.  Do you copy?  Shut down all the garbage smashes on the detention level.  No, shut them all down.  Hurry.  Hey, you did it, 3PO!  Oh, look.  Listen to them, R2.  They're dying.  Oh, curse my metal body.  I wasn't fast enough.  So, my fault, my fault.  We're all right.  You did great.  Where are we?  3, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 7.  And that's how it goes.  Wow. 
[03:12:00]  But for an hour.  Wow.  Why did Chuck all the chips across the table?  The poker chips.  That's the blessing of the poker chips.  The blessing.  The blessing of the poker chips.  The only thing I see is I did not hear Chewbacca.  Oh, well, he'd be like, mmm.  I heard that.  Oh, I didn't even catch it.  Okay.  All right.  Now, you do that for an hour straight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At that speed.  Faster.  There's no, um...  No break.  No pauses like they would normally pause between these lines.  You just rattle it out. 
[03:12:30]  Well, I mean, there's a little bit of break.  Yeah?  I don't know.  How much of the...  You do the entire movie?  Well, I mean, it's like the reader's digest version.  It's, like, been really super condensed down.  Yeah?  And I do Lord of the Rings as well, which is just dumb.  But anyway, it works.  Wow.  Yeah, you...  Okay, but...  Okay, there's this big, big, giant dork convention, Star Wars convention called Celebration 3, which  happened in Indianapolis, and, I mean, you get 3,500 people watching this show at a time. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Which is really, really strange.  I don't know, man.  I don't doubt it.  Wow.  I mean, like, movie screens on the other side of the audience, or on the other side of the  stage, and then out over the audience, and you'd never think that there could be that  many people that know Star Wars that well.  And what's the reaction as you're doing it?  Are they laughing?  Are they...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  For sure.  For sure.  And they're watching...  Well, for some people, it's just like watching a kid in the basement or something like that.  Yeah.  For other people, it's about being able to sort of celebrate their own personal infatuation  with Star Wars, you know?  Yeah.  So, you either find people that really are laughing at it, and other people that are laughing sort of 
[03:13:30]  with you.  Yeah.  So, it's really strange to have.  Wow.  Well, you've taken something and ran with it.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Cheers.  Thank you.  And best of luck to you with your one-man show.  We got some phone calls coming in.  We have Jimmy Robinson on the phone.  Jimmy!  Hey, this is Jimmy from New Jersey.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, man?  Hey, do you do this scene? 
[03:14:00]  I like this scene in Star Wars when he, like, had the fight, and then there's just the empty  robe with no one in it.  Yeah.  Do you do that one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you do the Robert Reed version?  The Robert Reed version.  You can't even die?  Yeah, yeah.  You stink.  Hey, serious calls only, you asshole.  You stink.  This is what happens now.  We get a guest on the show.  This is textbook.  Oh.  Get a guest on the show, and people call up, and no matter how much we tell them we just  want serious calls, the assholes get through.  You stink. 
[03:14:30]  Do you get a lot of criticism?  You are at stinks.  Do you get a lot of criticism?  There's a lot of criticism, and that's really high-brow criticism, man.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm crushed.  The thing is, I think based upon that kind of a phone call, I'm pretty much, you know,  resolved not to do the show anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm sure that guy was...  That was the last time, guys, you're ever going to hear it.  Loser sitting in his apartment, probably getting prostitutes at night to piss on him.  Well, let's say hi to Dr. Frank Davis.  Dr. Frank Davis.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I'm a doctor at Bellevue, a psychiatrist. 
[03:15:00]  Listen, just keep him distracted.  We're sending a few guys to get him.  You stink, you nut job.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to...  Let's say hi to...  Let's go to Ben in Boston.  Ben?  Ben!  You like that, huh, Ben?  Ben.  Yeah.  Can you just see where the Falcon goes and pick up Tom Brady?  We all just go...  Seems to be doing his own one-man show all day long.  I think this guy enjoyed it.  Ben from Boston. 
[03:15:30]  Holy man, I've got to get there to Boston.  Yeah.  Any ideas of maybe taking it on the road?  It's been on the road for the last three years, man.  Really?  Yeah.  So you're not just here in New York, you'll be going other places?  No, there's this thing called Clear Channel, which I'm sure we're all aware of.  Yes, everybody is aware of.  And I'm going to, at least with the Lord of the Rings show, I'm going to be going to South  Africa and Singapore and my family.  You're shitting me.  Man, I really...  Is there good money in this? 
[03:16:00]  I haven't had another job for the last four years, man.  Have you had to pay Lucas anything?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you get a proper licensing agreement.  Yeah.  If you don't do that, you can, you know...  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll cost you.  So, I mean, it's weird.  I really never intended for the show to go as it has, and I'm really glad that it has.  What, was it just kind of a hobby?  No, it was a...  I mean, I was working as an actor, and one day, like, literally, I wrote this comedy sketch,  and when I say it went really wrong, it went really, really right or really, really wrong, 
[03:16:30]  because I didn't think people would be able to sort of keep up with it.  Right.  And people have been able to keep up with it.  So this has kind of almost left my own hands.  I find myself here, not intending to come here to New York to bring this here.  But, you know, it's, you know, kind of go bigger or go back home, and, I mean, I don't  have a problem doing it, and...  You're going to franchise it out?  No, I don't think so.  Get some other actors to do it, and you just sit home and pocket some cash?  That would be nice, but I turn into Jabba the Hutt and lose my leg.  That's it. 
[03:17:00]  Why don't we go to Steve in Yellowstone?  Steve in Yellowstone.  Steve?  Hi.  I wanted to know if you had any type of a copyright problem when you were dealing with Dwork  Lucas like I've had sometimes on my website.  Uh, yeah, I mean, it is a copyright problem because it is, uh, you know, a matter of...  Ramon!  Bring me someone with talent.  What?  What the fuck are you talking about, you fucking retard?  Yeah!  Yeah.  Have fun in Yellowstone, buddy.  Maybe you can sit on, like, you know, the Old Faithful and have it go up your ass, you 
[03:17:30]  stupid piece of shit.  Ramon!  Wow, man.  I'm absolutely, you know, crushed down to my very foundations, man.  I just don't...  This is amazing.  All right, thank you, Steve in Yellowstone.  Hey, man.  Good luck.  A guy is successful taking something and using his talent to get out on stage and actually  do...  Yeah, and did you, uh, uh, you've been an actor, you said, uh...  Yeah, yeah, I mean, uh...  So now you're finally doing something that's working, you're making money, and people just  can't seem to, uh, deal with that, Steve. 
[03:18:00]  Well, at least not the people that are calling in here.  God, man.  No, I think it's pretty impressive.  Steve.  Or something.  You want to do another scene, or...?  Ah, no, no, that's fine, actually.  Uh, I mean, not many of the scenes from the show really work purely on, on radio, like,  because a lot of it doesn't really all stick together.  But, I mean, like, you get something like, you know...  Which is obviously, you know...  Jabba.  No, it's Princess Leia.  But, uh, you know...  Of course.  Yeah. 
[03:18:30]  I mean, there's scenes that people definitely recognize, and there's characters, like...  You know, people recognize, right?  Yes.  And, like...  Of course.  Yeah.  But, um...  Yeah.  It's weird, man.  Like, you kind of have to see it on stage in order to really get the full idea of it.  Well, that's why it's a stage show, and you don't have a CD out.  Do you have a CD out?  No.  It's not a CD or a DVD.  See?  And that's another thing, man.  Like, if, uh...  It's a weird thing with, you know, copyright material, you know...  You can only do this in one medium, live, like that.  If you wanted to put a CD out, you'd have to pay Lucas more money. 
[03:19:00]  Ah, yeah.  I don't think I could ever get the rights to do it.  No?  No, not really.  And that's okay.  I mean, it's something I wouldn't want to franchise out, because as long as I can do it, I'll continue doing it.  Right.  And I hopefully will not be a 65-year-old man, you know, like,  the one-man Star Wars trilogy, you know, like, nattering out on stage.  That'd be a little rough.  Listen to the screams of a person in Yellowstone National Park.  Sounds like you need some more...  Nah, that guy with the lungs.  That guy was just an ass.  Oh, well.  So what are the details?  The show's here in New York, right?  It is indeed, yeah.  It plays every night at 8 o'clock, except for Wednesdays. 
[03:19:30]  Right now we have matinees at 3 o'clock.  And it's going to be changing the schedule up a bit.  We'll still have the shows at 8 o'clock every night, but we'll have a 3 o'clock matinee on Saturday and Sunday.  And you can get tickets by calling telecharge.  Jimmy, you missed it.  What happened?  You all right?  Yes.  I was trying to get some production stuff because they're...  Oh.  Yeah.  Always the way.  Yes.  Well, Charles, thank you very much.  Thanks for having me, guys.  We're coming in.  Sorry about the goddamn phone calls. 
[03:20:00]  You were in 15 minutes, weren't you?  Jackasses.  That's all right.  Yeah, it's just production stuff that Ben was supposed to do and did not do.  Oh.  Can you do C-3PO?  C-3PO.  R-2-D-2, where are you?  Yeah.  Can you do...  I pardon you.  Jesus.  I pardon you.  They could just go on and on.  How about...  I don't know all the characters.  I was at the yesterday.  R-2?  I know R-2. 
[03:20:30]  Well, if you don't know the show, I mean, if you don't know the movies, it's...  No, no.  I saw the first one, but I don't know any of the new guys.  I do know R-2 with my slide whistle.  Yeah.  See?  You need a prop.  I feel like a prop sometimes.  Oh, don't you sweat it.  I won't.  I like seeing a successful guy.  Of course.  Cheers, guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Thank you.  Charles Ross.  One-man Star Wars show.  And there he goes.  We should take a break, I think, huh?  Charles?  We're going to take a break. 
[03:21:00]  We're going to regroup, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show in a few moments.  Yeah?  Yeah?  We'll continue in a couple of moments.  What happened?  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Oh, was he fucking pissed.  Why?  Livid.  He just walked out, by the way.  That wasn't a take it easy.  Did he cut some liners?  No.  He took off before his crew here even knew that he was gone. 
[03:21:30]  He was already out the door.  And they were like, oh, he left already.  And they took off the bathroom.  Someone follow him with the cell phone.  Wow.  He pissed off.  See what's wrong?  Yeah.  Someone who has balls?  See what's wrong?  Hurry up.  Clock on.  See what's wrong?  Ask him if everything went okay.  Well, that stupid caller from Yellowstone pissed him off.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Derek.  Creative little boy.  Steve from Yellowstone.  I sometimes have problems.  Hello?  No? 
[03:22:00]  I thought we had somebody.  What's the problem?  Oh, wait.  Here we go.  Eric.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey.  Hang on one second.  Hey, before you guys go, can they talk to you one more time?  It was about the lamp theater and everything.  We're about it for his plug.  He didn't say the lamp theater and all that.  He did.  The lamp theater?  Can they talk to you one more time?  Just...  We don't think it went well.  We want to ask him why he left angry.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hey.  Charles, you're not mad, are you? 
[03:22:30]  No, I just...  What happened?  It's all right, man.  No, what happened?  The theater is 130 West 44.  No, but the thing was, you seemed like you left when you were mad.  Yeah, I know.  I just...  You know, it's just kind of shitty, the phone calls coming in, and I don't know.  I kind of feel like it's an uphill battle, man.  I was puking all yesterday, and I've been puking this morning.  I'm really kind of sick, so it's not your fault.  It's me.  Charles.  The audience, too.  Charles, there's only three phone calls.  I know. 
[03:23:00]  I know, man.  Out of the three we talked.  It's not your guys' fault, man.  I'm just being a big baby, so...  Sorry.  Yeah, but why are you being a baby?  All right.  You're very talented, obviously, and the show's doing very well.  No, it's doing well, man.  What kind of...  Are you not sick like a flu or something, are you?  Yeah, I've had the flu for like the last couple of days.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Hope you didn't bring it in here.  I hope I did.  Why?  Where's the...  Charles, are you mad at us, though?  No.  No.  God, no, man.  Not at all. 
[03:23:30]  Who are you mad at?  Just the whole, you know, guys calling in and stuff like that.  Yeah.  We get that, though, every day.  It happens, dude.  We get you all that, too.  You know, you do put yourself out there, and it's like, I'm pretty easy to kick in the  balls, and I try to always guybosh the people trying to kick me in the balls beforehand.  Yeah.  You know, and it's like...  That Steve guy calls every day, though.  Yeah, Steve calls us and bashes us every day.  You should hear what he says about us every day.  Steve in Yellowstone stinks, and that guy Ben in Boston's awful, if you understand what 
[03:24:00]  he's saying.  They're like regular callers that we can't screen out that just call up and bash us and  our guests all the time.  Yeah.  Guy drives a hybrid car, for God's sake.  Enough said.  Yeah.  I just, you know, when you feel sick, and you know, you try to put it up there, it just,  I don't know, man.  I feel like an uphill battle.  No, you did not. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, you scumbag.  Holy shit.  He's talking about the uphill battle.  Click.  Oh, you didn't.  Gotta give the guy credit, though.  I threw that entire poker chip thing at him, and he didn't even flinch.  He didn't even miss a...  He didn't even stop. 
[03:25:00]  You can act like a man!  What's the matter with you?  Why is it Eric calling back?  Hopefully he's got a fist in his gum line.  Dude, I just...  Frunk.  Shit, fucking mayonnaise leaking out of his teeth.  Good shot to the mouth.  Right now that dummy is trying to explain why, like, the phone hung up, and it's still showing  the minutes you're taking.  Like, no, I...  Yeah, let's get him back on the phone. 
[03:25:30]  What happened?  Are you kidding?  Why'd he hang up on us?  Shh, shh, shh.  Okay.  Eric, why do you...  Yeah, the phone must have cut out or something.  Ah, damn it.  All right.  Hold on.  That wasn't me hanging out.  No?  All right.  We thought, because right when that happened, we were like, uh-oh, he's pissed.  Yeah, we don't want...  Oh.  No, we don't want you going away mad, and we want to give you the final word here.  So, uh, Charles.  Charles.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Charles.  So what were you saying? 
[03:26:00]  Um, I don't know what it was.  I guess it's just...  You're saying you're feeling sick or something like that?  Yeah.  It's just about...  Okay, I had to do, like, two shows yesterday, and it was, like, wolfing in between the shows.  I don't know.  Everybody's got some kind of cold of some sort.  No, it was something about an uphill battle, and...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're easy to get to, and you're working on that or something like that?  What's that?  You said something about, and the thought kind of got cut off, that you're easy to kick  in the balls to get to, and you feel like you're going to be an uphill battle.  Try doing this type of show here, right?  And, like, you know, sometimes trying to maintain a sense of, like, feeling good about yourself. 
[03:26:30]  You know, it's such a strange thing to be doing, because, like...  I can't be part of this.  This show stinks.  You feel good about yourself?  Ka-ching.  You know, right now... 
[03:27:00]  That's hard sometimes.  Click.  And right now, Eric is trying to explain why it once again cut off, and why the mouthpiece  smells like the inside of a baby coffin.  Ah...  Oh, jeez.  Breathe.  Nope.  All right.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Eric, what happened?  He came back in. 
[03:27:30]  He followed me in.  He wants to come back in.  Oh.  And we've moved.  All right.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Let me get out of the studio first, because I've got to call again.  Yeah.  Um...  You can tell him I want to...  No, keep his handlers.  Just wait.  Away from that window.  I know.  Where's Ben?  Ben's in the back.  Dude!  What the hell is going on?  Oh, Jesus.  That's too funny.  There he is.  I don't know what's going on with the phone. 
[03:28:00]  Were you in the elevator area?  No, I was going to the bathroom.  Oh, no.  That...  No.  Why?  No, it's not you guys at all, man.  Yeah, I've had...  On my days off, I got to look after my girlfriend and our two friends that came from Victoria  to visit us, and they were puking, like, lying down on, like, the couch and on the bed,  just barfing in bags and stuff, so...  What's Victoria?  Canada?  Yeah, British Columbia.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Where are you from up there?  Victoria.  Victoria?  No, I live in Victoria, but, I mean, I was born in this place called Prince George, B.C., 
[03:28:30]  which...  Did you ever see the movie Strange Brew?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, with Rick Moran.  That's all we know of Canada, is through Strange Brew.  Strange Brew.  Well, it was filmed in Prince George, B.C.  That's where I was born and where I kind of grew up, until I was, like, 11 years old  or something, and I watched...  Oh, thank you.  I'm not sure if they ever told you, but I'd watched the Star Wars trilogy, like, over 400  times before I was 11 years old.  Oh, you did?  Mm-hmm.  Why?  It was just your thing?  We didn't have television.  We had a television, we had a VCR, but we didn't have cable. 
[03:29:00]  It was very cool when you were a kid.  I mean, I watched that movie, I can't even tell you how many times, too.  As a kid?  I mean, sitting there, you had the opening scene, first time you ever saw it?  It was the best thing ever.  Yeah, I know.  Of course.  But, I mean, I put it on, like, sort of as background noise, do you know what I mean?  Really?  In the morning, just...  Wait, you just had no TV?  Did you get the whole movie memorized?  Uh, no.  Word for word, no?  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  I mean, when I wrote this, though, it was going from memory, rather than going back and watching  the films and try to...  Really?  Yeah.  So there could be some inaccuracies.  Oh, huge inaccuracies. 
[03:29:30]  And you get people telling me that I've got this wrong, or that wording wrong, or something  wrong, and it's like, well, who cares?  They're probably dressed like Jedi with lightsabers in their hands when they tell you this.  Oh, yeah, and I've met a lot of those people.  You've been to the conventions?  Uh, well, just to perform, I've never actually been to a convention.  Yeah.  Outside of a...  Scary people.  Well, some, but a lot of these people have really normal jobs and normal lives, too, right?  Like, they just, they do normal things, except that this is their hobby.  So...  Well, you've got a lot of action on the phones.  I mean, they're just going crazy.  Oh, great.  We've got a call coming in from Riskless, Montana. 
[03:30:00]  Well, let's do it.  This is, uh, Travis.  Travis!  Hey, dude, why are they giving you such a hard time?  I thought it was pretty good what you did.  Oh, thanks.  Good.  All right, there you go.  See, that's positive.  I told you.  I'm a fan of the movie.  I mean, it's hard to find somebody that kind of knows everything about the movie, and everybody  thinks I'm a geek, but I like the movie.  Well, there's nothing wrong with that.  There you go.  People think I'm a geek, too.  How old were you when you started, like, watching the movies and stuff?  How old was I?  He said he saw the movie 400 times before he was 11, I think.  First time I saw it was in Waikiki.  We used to live between Waikiki and Prince George, so the first time I saw it was near 
[03:30:30]  the Waikiki Banyan, if you've ever been to Waikiki.  What?  Why?  Did you just...  Ramon!  Oh, it's this guy again.  Did you just squeal off the road again, buddy?  Is this Steve...  Oh, this guy's got this guy.  Ramon!  This guy's got black dick.  Why do the screeners...  No, this guy tricked us.  The screeners can't find out that that's not Travis. 
[03:31:00]  Ramon!  Star Wars is a faggot.  All right, we get it.  Ramon!  Tell this guy...  Steve!  ...talk.  Steve, please lose the phone number.  Where do you live, man?  Ramon!  Tell this faggot that Wookiee is unreal.  Holy shit, dude.  The guy's cracking himself up.  This is awesome.  All right, Steve. 
[03:31:30]  Do you want my home number, fuckhead?  Really?  What?  You know, they're faceless people.  I love it.  Like message board people.  They have no face.  They love joking and bashing, but they never want to confront anybody.  Come down to the studio.  We'll kick your ass.  Why don't you come in the studio, buddy?  Steve.  Go find your boyfriend, Ramon, or whatever the hell.  Why don't you come in the studio?  Dead balls.  All right, there he goes. 
[03:32:00]  Jesus.  Sorry about that, buddy.  It's a daily battle on this show to deal with these assholes.  Brian Clifton, what's up?  Hey, this is Brian from Clifton Park.  Hey, Brian.  I saw them at Celebration 3.  I loved them.  I really did.  Oh, okay.  All this crap they're giving you is a bunch of bullshit.  Saw the show?  You're very talented.  I love the films.  You know, what people do, and it's a great film, and I can't believe that people are dissing  them like this.  It's a bunch of jack-offs.  You're always going to get it.  Keep doing what you're doing. 
[03:32:30]  I saw it at Celebration 3.  Keep it up.  I'm punching out.  You're always going to get the one or two, what they call the bad apples.  So what is with Ramone?  I don't care.  Every time this Steve guy calls, it's always about Ramone.  We still don't know what it means.  But he actually listens to the radio and then bothers to call in.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he does.  He actually listens and then calls in to bash.  Is he like your sort of village idiot? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, every day.  Every day.  Every day.  Every day we've got to deal with this shit.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Who cares, Ramone?  Dan in New Hampshire checking in.  Let's say hi to Liddy.  Liddy.  Hey, how are you doing?  Hello?  Liddy.  What's up, Liddy?  Why's the break giving this guy a hard time?  Liddy, you stink.  Ramone.  All right.  I got it again.  Ramone. 
[03:33:30]  Darth Vader has AIDS.  Holy shit, dude.  Stop.  Would you?  Why do you call?  Ramone.  T-3PO should be molested.  Wash my bones.  He's got an...  He's Liddy.  Liddy and Ramone?  Like, what the hell?  Liddy.  This is Liddy.  Ramone.  Ramone is going to be an awful producer.  He needs a writer, obviously. 
[03:34:00]  He's got no material, dude.  Ramone.  Why are Ryan says hiring that lazy bag of shit?  I don't even know what he's talking about.  All right.  Wow.  Thank you, Liddy.  Goddamn.  So, he's like an honorary DJ, sort of like on the...  Honorary?  The Eye in the Sky or something like that?  Yeah.  For some reason, he's very good at getting past the screeners.  Let's go to the Ramone part.  Guys, any more Steve from Yellowstone calls, and you guys are done. 
[03:34:30]  I mean, Jesus.  Check the caller ID.  Yeah.  Don't we have caller ID?  Ben, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  I want him to do Yoda eating Princess Leia's ass.  Ramone.  No, this is on Ramone.  Was that him?  Is this somebody totally new?  Yeah, do you do that, though?  Seriously, if you do all the voices, do you mess around with the voices a little bit?  No, not really.  Do an alternate scene?  Well, no eating of Leia's ass.  No.  But that would be great.  Any other movies that you have in mind to take into this? 
[03:35:00]  I was thinking of Terms of Endearment, maybe.  Terms of Endearment.  That would be great.  How about blowing Chewbacca?  Blowing Chewbacca.  All right.  Look at the size of that thing.  I think Star Wars, The Wrath of Khan.  Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan would probably be a good one.  Good choice.  Sonny Ferelli, what's up?  Hey, this guy's really good, man.  Oh.  Ramone.  All right.  All right.  Hey, you know something?  Your book is doing an excellent job.  What's his name, Ramone?  Punching out.  That's not even Steve. 
[03:35:30]  I don't even get that one.  All right.  Frenchie.  Hey.  This guy is very good.  Why is everybody giving him shit?  Ramone.  Is that the real Frenchie?  Yes.  And you like it?  You like it?  Yes, I like him.  He's good.  Okay.  He does a good job.  Come to my restaurant.  Oh.  Plug your restaurant.  Ramone, this guy sucks.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Bring this guy.  A self-inflicted gunshot wound.  All right. 
[03:36:00]  Look.  Ramone.  I've had it.  I have had it.  Bring me a hybrid vehicle.  Ramone.  You really got to bring this guy on, man.  Bring me a belly the size of a change purse.  Jesus Christ.  Ramone.  Shave my arms.  All right.  Thank you, Frenchie. 
[03:36:30]  Stop it.  All right.  Thanks.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, Charles.  Charles Ross.  Charles, again.  Star Wars show.  Again, thank you very much.  Also, I believe in the new year, we're going to be opening up the one-man Lord of the Rings  probably in the same space as well.  Right here in New York.  Yeah.  Very cool.  So, uh...  Can you give us a little taste of that?  Ah, sure.  We wants it.  We needs it.  Must have the precious.  Master is our friend.  You don't have any friends.  Nobody likes you. 
[03:37:00]  I'm not listening.  You're a liar and a thief.  Nope.  Murderer.  I hate you.  But it was with me.  Him.  Him.  It was me.  We survived because of me.  Not anymore.  What?  We don't need you.  Leave now and never come back.  Leave now and never come back.  Anyway. 
[03:37:30]  Wow.  That's pretty damn good.  No more chips than me, though.  It was good.  That's...  Well, it's really cool, though.  The guy who played Gandalf, Ian McKelm, came and saw the show when I did it.  Really?  Yeah, it was weird.  And he actually really liked it.  Yeah, I mean, it's been a really strange thing, man, like getting, going from like doing  just sort of the comedy sketch thing to suddenly playing with the big boys or, you know, having  to like suddenly be in the scrutiny of Steve.  Of the likes of a Steve from Yellowstone. 
[03:38:00]  That would be a little nerve-wracking, though, having Ian McKelm there.  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, because he's like, you know, an actor.  He was in the movie.  Yeah, exactly.  So, you know, if he hated it, then I'd feel like crap or just sort of feel worse than sometimes,  you know, you do when Steve calls you Ramon or whatever it is.  Yeah, Ramon every goddamn day.  How about The Matrix?  I don't know.  Yeah.  The Matrix would probably work.  It could work.  It's kind of hard to find like a show that's that popular.  You know, like Star Wars, Lothering is super popular. 
[03:38:30]  But I think in terms of Endearment, if they put out one more, man, it'll be right up there.  Fried Green Tomatoes.  I was thinking maybe the Muppets.  Madison County.  You bet.  That's a good one.  What's up, Jimmy?  Did he get the...  Yeah, he's getting the auction stuff all together.  Yeah, okay.  Cool.  Very good.  All right, we're going to say goodbye to Charles.  I'm going to bring another stuff in, though, which I will bring in, the stuff from the  CD, which I can bring in.  All right, Charles did a great job for us today.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you so much.  Feel better.  All right, I will.  I hope so.  All right.  Cheers.  See you.  What's up?  This is Dane Cook.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:39:00]  There are so many people that show up every day just to hang and check out the show.  Friends of people, I don't know, fans that hang out outside all night.  We say, all right, come on in and check out the show.  And most people, you never even hear on mic.  They're just there kind of checking it out.  And we say hi after the show, and we go about our lives.  But every once in a while, people that are coming down just to hang become part of the  show.  And Gavin is part of the show because I walk in the studio from a leak break, and everyone's  checking out this sick video that's on your cell phone. 
[03:39:30]  The things we do back home.  So now we have to talk about it a little bit.  Explain what this fantastic video is.  Well, it's basically me and my couple of buddies went to a swingers party in England.  And my friend ended up getting banged up the ass with a strap-on dildo.  Your friend got banged up the ass with a strap-on.  Wait, you guys just go to a swingers party?  Yeah.  That's the kind of thing we do, you know.  Instead of getting bummed, we thought we'd go to a party and get bummed ourselves. 
[03:40:00]  Had he ever gotten...  I can't confirm that.  You don't know if he's gotten it in the ass before.  I don't think so.  Not from the screams.  No.  Why would you decide that he's not from the screams?  Yeah.  This guy lets out some howl.  Well, the thing is, it's a dominatrix, and she's got a strap-on.  That's correct.  And she's the one that's screwing him in the ass with a strap-on.  There you go.  But behind her is somebody.  There you go.  That's fucking her. 
[03:40:30]  There you go.  So with every thrust the guy does to her, she's doing a thrust with the strap-on, so she  can't be very gentle to this guy.  And this guy is just, ah, like getting hammered.  And it sounds painful.  And Gavin's just filming the whole thing on his cell phone.  And you hear Gavin laughing.  I can hear you laughing like an idiot.  And then I'm watching the video, and I see the girl in the middle, and I had to blurt  out, she's the lucky one.  Yeah, where did this slob come from?  It was all down in London about two months ago. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah?  And she was just at this corner party?  She was just at a party, yeah, and she just decided to come back with us to the hotel.  And she had like a box of toys to display things with us as well.  So I've got a little shit on here as well that I can show you.  You know, if there's a chick, and she comes back to the hotel, and she's got a box of toys,  the last thing I'm thinking is, hey, could you strap that on and put it up my ass?  That's the last thing I was thinking as well.  How do you get to that point?  You guys are all hanging in the hotel room.  Were you drunk?  Yeah, we was all drunk, and it's a filthy week.  I've been drunk. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, that is no excuse.  Like, did you have any inkling that he might enjoy, something like that?  No, he actually volunteered for it, you know.  He was like, what are we going to do with this?  Oh, you know what?  I'll get fucked in the ass with this, no problem.  Who wants it in his ass?  Right here.  Me.  Volunteers.  All right.  All right, why don't we listen to a little of it?  Let's see if I can get it on the...  What, I'll just put it to the mug door?  Yeah.  We'll all be quiet and listen in on the audio at least.
