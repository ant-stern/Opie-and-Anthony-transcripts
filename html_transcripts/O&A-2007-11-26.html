<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping experiences, fueled by E-Rock's recounting of his chaotic Black Friday ordeal and subsequent purchases for his parents. This transitioned into a humorous conversation about underwear preferences, various brands, and a caller reporting Black Friday rioting at a Massachusetts mall.  The undefeated New England Patriots and Bill Belichick’s coaching style were debated extensively, with callers and hosts engaging in passionate, often heated, arguments. Bob Kelly filled in for Jim Norton.  The show then shifted to video games, particularly the Wii, with callers sharing gaming anecdotes, including injuries.  Extensive trash-talking about Eli Manning and the physical appearance of quarterbacks, including the “Predator look” among players with dreadlocks, followed.  The hosts and callers shared personal experiences with games like "The Sims," "Battlefield 1942," "Tiger Woods," and "Call of Duty 4," detailing in-game strategies and online trash-talking.  The segment concluded with a discussion about past and present experiences with “cyber sex” and a disgruntled caller criticizing the video game talk.

A listener named Ginger then called, expressing boredom and criticizing the hosts' immature behavior and focus on “crotch shots.” This led to a playful, yet insulting exchange, with the hosts questioning Ginger's relationship and accusing her of being a “man hater.” Ginger revealed she was 42, had a boyfriend who was an investment banker, and disliked video games.  The conversation deteriorated into further insults and personal attacks.  A caller, Joe from Michigan, then shared his unhappy marriage after meeting his wife online, prompting a discussion about the difficulties of marriage and parenthood, with Opie expressing reservations about having children.  Observations of unhappy couples at the mall led to a discussion on the perceived sacrifices people make for their children. A call from Aspen in Maine, who admitted to buying a PS3 to attract dates via MySpace, resulted in more teasing and jokes about her appearance based on her MySpace photos. The discussion moved to ringtones, focusing on the popular "Por que no te callas?" ringtone, and the hosts' own ringtones, including sounds created by Steve, a staff member.  Listeners’ remixes of these sounds were played on air. The segment concluded with a discussion of movies ("The Departed," "No Country for Old Men") and a humorous examination of celebrities' physical imperfections, including Denzel Washington's pinky finger, Vince Vaughn's thumb, and Stephen Colbert's ears.

The next segment focused on celebrity physical deformities and unusual features. The hosts and callers listed numerous examples, including Val Kilmer’s elbow, Daryl Hannah’s fingertip,  various television personalities’ Botox-affected mouths, Gary Burghoff’s missing fingers, astronaut Donald Slayton's unspecified difference, Jerry Garcia and Tony Iommi’s missing fingers,  misattributed characteristics of Boris Yeltsin and Gorbachev,  a pitcher with six fingers, John Travolta's hair, Stuart Scott's eye, Angie Harmon’s eye size, Catherine Zeta-Jones’ and Sharon Stone's neck scars, Mick Foley's wrestling injury, Howie Rose's neck fat, and Lee Corso’s small arm.  Speculation about the causes of these features was rampant. Callers added John Travolta's nose, Christian Bale's mole, and Owen Wilson’s nose to the list. The conversation branched out to hotel room cleanliness, Hulk Hogan’s divorce, and a news story about a man assaulting his paralyzed wife. A detailed, graphic description of female genitalia followed, alongside a discussion of a vaginal screening kit.  The hosts conducted a crude medical examination of a co-worker, using offensive language.  A discussion of a “shitty” replacement radio show in West Palm Beach,  followed by numerous caller anecdotes about public figures' physical peculiarities,  completed the segment.  Bobby Kelly was a guest in the studio for this segment.

The following segment centered on Opie and Anthony's reaction to being replaced in their West Palm Beach timeslot by Jeremy Loper and Smitty.  The show opened with a sexually explicit conversation about the G-spot.  The hosts then played audio clips of Loper and Smitty's show, characterized by banal conversations about their families, frequent use of "awesome," and repeated mentions of "Lopeweiser."  Opie and Anthony mocked their style relentlessly using highly offensive language.  They invented humorous beverage names ("Doucheweiser," "Anttell Light") and nicknames for Smitty ("Whisker Biscuit").  The recurring “Lopeweiser” sound effect and Loper’s past use of the name "Rex" were recurring jokes.  They also ridiculed audio from Darian O'Toole, a female radio personality, and a segment called "Stalker Patty Gets High." Numerous listener calls echoed their negative assessment.

A phone interview with the highly intoxicated Darian O'Toole followed. Opie, Anthony, and in-studio guest David Tell discussed O'Toole's slurred speech, boastful statements, and claims about her career and relationships with celebrities, including Tom Cruise. They challenged her apparent intoxication and contradictory statements, including her questionable recollections of past interactions with them and her claim to be appearing on "The View."  The hosts engaged in a humorous wager regarding this claim. Listener calls added to the chaos. The segment concluded with the hosts mocking O'Toole and creating a new segment, "Dumb Cunt Monday," with O'Toole as the inaugural guest.

The final segment featured a heated argument with a caller named Darian, who repeatedly claimed she would co-host *The View*, offering a $5,000 bet. Opie and Anthony aggressively challenged her claims, using highly offensive insults. They dismissed her story about a connection with them, questioned her sanity, and mocked her.  The argument involved a discussion about a supposed friendship with Mark Parenteau and a past radio station experience.  The hosts briefly mentioned Michelle Obama’s upcoming guest appearance on *The View*. The segment concluded with promotional announcements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shock, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put $380 in my chest and a full trigger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going.  They are sick, freaks! 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like transvestite, or transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Why are you hitting your, like, headphones?  We're ready to go. 
[00:01:30]  Like you're ready to get into the big game.  That's it. Ready to go.  I'm ready, coach! I'm ready!  Put me in.  Just banging on the side of your football helmet.  It's showtime!  Had a little time off, you know?  So you excited to be back on the radio?  Oh, no. Don't get me wrong.  Of course I am.  I love this crap.  Of course.  I screwed my sleep up, but that's par for the course over a long weekend.  Yeah, this morning the alarm went off,  and I'm like, why isn't my chick turning the alarm off? 
[00:02:00]  And why is she getting up so early?  Oh, that's right.  And then I realized, oh my god, it's my alarm,  and it's time to get back to work.  Everyone's back to work.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  On this Cyber Monday, everybody.  That's what they're calling it.  Black Friday was when you went to the store.  If you were insane.  Everybody else stayed away from the store.  E-Rock went.  I figured.  Why would you go to the store on Black Friday?  Because E-Rock is one of those people that has to buy into the hype of everything 
[00:02:30]  and think that the sales on Friday aren't going to be there until Christmas  and then after Christmas.  So you got to, I got to get to Black Friday.  They told me to go to the store, so I got to go.  I went to the Walt Whitman Mall yesterday,  and they still were having sales all over the place.  It wasn't that bad yesterday.  Really?  It really wasn't.  But the sales were still the same.  All the sales signs were up from Black Friday.  Why are they going to take it down?  They're not going to take it down.  It was working well for them.  They're going to leave them up and sell more crap. 
[00:03:00]  And everyone knows the sales aren't really sales anyway.  Black Friday sales up over 7% from last year.  Cyber Monday begins today.  Now, what happened to cyber all year?  That's pretty much what cyber buying online is.  It's all year long.  If you want something, you go online and buy it.  Black Friday used to mean something else,  and Cyber Monday used to mean something else.  And now it's all about buying stuff.  It's just buying stuff.  How great would it be if it was really Cyber Monday 
[00:03:30]  where we all get an opportunity to just have cyber sex?  Cyber sex Monday?  You just get on there.  Hey, honey, it's Cyber Monday.  What can I tell you?  Okay.  Let's go private.  Right.  All right.  Could be it's cyber every day.  You want to go private?  Cyber every day in this stupid room with these jackers.  So I guess Cyber Monday, what?  You just buy something online?  Is that the deal?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, then go buy something. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, go buy something online.  Good for you, then.  You buying into Cyber Monday there, Iraq?  No.  Iraq actually went out on Friday.  That had to be a nightmare.  Why would you go out on Black Friday?  Were you there at one in the morning waiting for the stores to open?  4 a.m.  No, you weren't.  Why?  What's the matter with you?  There were some deals that my parents insisted that they needed me to go shopping for.  Your parents are rich. 
[00:04:30]  Like, Black Friday is for people that might not have a lot of money.  Oh, we don't bring race into it.  It's actually said so that it's when the store owners get in the black and out of the red.  That's why they call it that.  I've been around the Nagels.  Now you're using really derogatory terms that I don't think should be used here.  I've been around the Nagels, though.  I mean, they got a few bucks in their back pocket. 
[00:05:00]  There's no reason for them to be going shopping on Black Friday.  I call it being Nagel rich.  Right.  Yeah.  They're Nagel rich, and they send their son out to buy stuff here in New York.  What was the big purchase for the Nagel family on Black Friday?  A couple of the XM boombox car stereo combinations.  Wait, wait, wait.  Are you insane?  You can get that for free.  I know.  We work for XM. 
[00:05:30]  You can get that for free with one phone call.  I know, but he needed it for that day to give to some people who work for him.  So I went out there, and I purchased those and a few other things.  There was a line at least almost half a mile waiting to get into Best Buy at 5 a.m.  That there was police there.  Of course there were.  Keeping everything down.  It was insane.  See, that I don't get.  Because you could go today, and it'll be the same price. 
[00:06:00]  It'll be the same without the line.  Yeah.  For the most part.  Oh, what are you going to pay?  An extra five bucks.  Yeah.  Maybe.  If they did jack the price up at all.  You bought into the hype.  A lot of people buy into the hype, though.  You're not alone, Iraq.  I never bought into the hype as far as anything goes.  You will never see me in a store on Friday after Thanksgiving.  It just ain't going to happen.  Yeah, but the phone calls.  Why would I want that torture?  The phone calls will start.  Well, you guys make a good living.  Why would you?  This was when I was a bum.  Thank you.  That's what I was about to say, too. 
[00:06:30]  I know.  Yesterday.  I went underpants shopping yesterday.  Ooh, did you buy the box of the sexy man on the cover?  It was a wall of sexy effing men in their underpants.  And then I just want basic crap I can work out in and stuff.  I don't need the fancy Calvin Klein's to do a few bench presses.  Fruit of the Looms or Hanes.  I wanted Hanes.  Things like that.  Hanes to Michael Jordan underwear.  And the guy.  The extra space up front. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  The guy in the sock store at the mall.  Like, obviously, the sock store in the mall, this guy's getting all the crappy underpants  that can't sell in the department stores, the weird colors.  Yeah.  And throwing them up on a shelf.  Colors I can't even describe in underpants.  I'm like, I just want white, possibly gray.  Maybe I'll go crazy and get black.  That's it.  I don't need fuchsia.  I don't need, like, I don't even know how to describe these colors.  Boxers or the tighty-whities? 
[00:07:30]  Huh?  Boxers or the tighty-whities?  No, boxer briefs is the only way to go.  Boxer briefs is the only way to go.  Those are just long-legged tighty-whities, right?  Yeah.  Well, not long.  I mean, they go what?  Well, yeah.  Almost halfway down.  I have a few of those.  I got everything but boxers.  I don't like boxers because they just wrinkle up when you pull your pants up.  I know Jimmy Norton is a big fan of those, but he's not here to defend himself.  I like to wear the bikini briefs sometimes.  Jesus.  Those look so stupid on the boxes because you're studying these idiots going, all right, well, 
[00:08:00]  he looks good in those.  Maybe I should buy those.  Yeah.  Maybe it's the six-pack, eight-pack abs that they have on.  Yeah.  Where do you buy those?  I have to wear the boxers.  The boxer briefs because I'm a little heavyset.  A little?  Yeah, you don't want to.  In the summer when you sweat, it just causes a disaster down there.  Yeah, you're right.  I need absorption.  I need to wear like a male tampon.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Like if I wear a boxer, if I wear boxers, it's just, there's no protection. 
[00:08:30]  You can't wear, I don't like boxers because they just wrinkle up.  You pull your pants up and the pant leg to the boxer is up on your hip.  Yeah.  You have to pull them down with you.  It's too much work.  Pull them up together.  That's ridiculous.  Like what, an eight-year-old?  You're going to sit there with your pants and underpants down at the urinal or something?  Yeah, you can't pull the, yeah, I guess.  I don't know where you're going, but.  I mean, this is very interesting, but we have to go back to Iraq.  I'm getting a communique that he was also at Macy's at 6 a.m. to buy luggage. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  The airline destroyed my suitcase going down to Florida for Thanksgiving.  So they had a nice sale on luggage.  The airline destroyed your suitcase.  Yeah.  Was it a new suitcase?  It's about a year.  Really?  And they didn't want to take any responsibility for it, so I had to go buy a brand new set  in a certain color so we could take it, so we had stuff to take home. 
[00:09:30]  Uh-huh.  So why would you, whatever.  Whatever.  I hope you're so frustrated.  It's 50 bucks.  I never, I never, even when I had no money, I didn't look for sales.  Just bought my stuff, whatever.  Yeah.  Usually when it was the most convenient, too.  Not waking up at one in the morning, two in the morning to be online.  No, there's equity in sleeping in.  There really is.  It's like your time is worth something.  All right.  Let's say hi to James in New Hampshire.  James, what's up?  Listening on BCN.  How are you, buddy?  Good morning, gentlemen. 
[00:10:00]  Good morning, James.  Hey, I just wanted to give you guys an update on Black Friday in Massachusetts.  It's the Rentham Mall.  Yeah, sure.  I remember that place.  There was rioting.  There was people throwing trash barrels through car windows.  I love it.  The report is 3,500 people rioting.  You've got to love those mass holes.  Just to save a few bucks, whatever.  I personally don't get it.  I never went for a bargain.  But there you go. 
[00:10:30]  Hey, go, Pats Go, by the way.  11-0.  So now they go with the AFC East title is done.  So what?  Do they sit out Brady?  I think they want to go undefeated.  If I was the team, I would call a press conference this morning and go,  look, everyone's wondering, are we going to sit Brady for the remaining five games,  rest him up for the playoffs, or play him maybe a quarter or two?  We, as a team, want to go undefeated.  The freaking New England would just go nuts.  People would be like, oh, my God. 
[00:11:00]  And every game would be just awesome from here on out.  Yeah.  But, of course, they'll probably start sitting him a lot.  You think it's not important to them to go undefeated?  I don't think so.  I think it's more important to win another Super Bowl.  Undefeated and winning a Super Bowl.  But I think they've won so many Super Bowls that this would be probably more impressive at this point.  Yeah.  To go undefeated?  Belichick doesn't want to.  He wants to put the hammer down on everybody.  He got caught cheating.  Yeah, that cheating thing has really put a bug up his.  Yeah, he's like, okay, take the video cameras away. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to face every team.  No cheating.  I'm going to kick your ass anyway.  And now they just scored Will.  They just scored Will this team.  Well, last night they didn't.  Last night.  No, last night a little tight.  Eagles gave him a little run for their money, right?  Oh, my God.  They sacked Tom Brady.  I've never seen him sacked like that.  He had no idea it was coming, and he hit him like a lump of lamb.  He just went down, and his head smashed.  And I looked at his little bum chin, and I was, oh, I felt so bad. 
[00:12:00]  I just wanted to run on the field and pick him up and get a hobble.  Well, don't worry.  He's got a supermodel to do that for him.  Oh, God.  It's fine.  He'll be okay.  Yeah, he doesn't need a fat comedian.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  He's got one of the hottest women in the world doing exactly what you want to do to him.  So I think you're not needed, Bob.  You never know.  He might have a fetish.  He might be a chubby chaser.  Oh, God.  I wish he was.  Boavi, you're from Massachusetts.  What do you think of the Pats?  The Pats are going to go undefeated. 
[00:12:30]  I mean, last night, and they played the Colts.  But see, I need.  They just pull it out.  I need Belichick to just have a press conference and go, here's the deal.  Everyone's wondering.  We're going for it.  I just want you guys to know we're going for it.  He's been saying that every week since he got caught cheating.  His interviews are like, look, that's it.  We're doing this.  That's it.  We go out and try to win every game.  And we're going to keep Brady in.  I know there's a risk of him getting hurt.  But, I mean, there's five games left.  That could be a really boring month unless he says something. 
[00:13:00]  But there's a risk of him getting hurt every year.  I mean, if they have one loss, he's playing every game.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So put him in anyways.  Who cares?  Go for the undefeated.  I'd love to see those Miami.  What is it?  The 72 Dolphins?  Yeah.  I would love to see them just fade away and no one ever bring their names up again.  Finally.  I hate them.  Finally, we can stop saying the 72 Dolphins.  Oh, and they're going to come to the game.  I've always hated the Dolphins. 
[00:13:30]  You know they go to the game.  That game, they all sit on the other team's sideline and watch the other team.  Like these decrepit old men that can't even walk because they have nine knee surgeries each.  Ow, my knee, man.  You should talk.  At least they're old with bad knees.  I got one in my early 30s for jumping an inch off the ground.  Yeah, you got a dead guy partner in your leg.  That's creepy.  Hey, it's a good time to be a Boston sports fan, though, man.  You got the Red Sox. 
[00:14:00]  You got the Pats.  You got the freaking Celtics winning every time out now.  Yeah.  I'm not going to acknowledge the Bruins.  Sorry.  What are they?  What are they?  Fourth place?  Third place?  Who?  The Bruins?  I don't know.  I think they're in third place.  I just pay attention to my Islanders.  And we played the Bruins over the weekend.  They got us one.  And we got them down here.  You don't have to worry about the Bruins doing anything.  After, since Cam Neely left, it's all over.  God, that's years ago.  Jesus.  Jesus.  I'm back. 
[00:14:30]  I remember Ray Bork.  Ray Bork, sure.  Football Picks, by the way, sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  Looks like Danny was the big winner.  Danny and E-Rock are fighting it out.  Or they tied for the win this week?  Tied.  All right, very good.  So they split the money.  And I went five out of what?  How many games did we pick this week?  Seven?  Five out of seven.  My brother did pretty well this week.  I'm still nine out of the lead.  Nine out of the lead.  Our phone number, 877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:15:00]  Let's go to Charles in Jersey.  Charles, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How's it going?  Pretty good, man.  Yeah, I worked at Best Buy over in Secaucus.  Secaucus?  Yeah, it's back in 2003 for Black Friday, man.  And all that stuff that they have in the ad,  the $200 laptop, the $500 plasma TV,  it's just going to break down in like six months.  You know?  Why is it going to break down in six months?  Isn't it new? 
[00:15:30]  No, it's all like cheap stuff, man.  It's like buying basic cigarettes.  It's the leftover stuff.  Refurbished?  Well, the other pants I was attempting to buy was like...  It's certainly refurbished.  All right, well.  Whatever.  Another thing about the Dolphins, man,  no matter what, they're still going to be in everybody's mind  that they went undefeated.  Also, I hope Brady and them go undefeated,  but what are you going to do?  They're the better team right now,  and the 72 Dolphins are playing now. 
[00:16:00]  I've got bummed knees, you know?  All right, thanks, sir.  I'm about to add.  I would love to see the Patriots go undefeated.  I think that would be awesome, man.  Bill in Watertown, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, I'm just wondering,  why is it that E-Rock can make it up at 4 a.m. to go to the stores,  but he can't make it to work on time?  Oh, jeez.  Wow, E-Rock, that's a good point right there.  Oh, E-Rock, comment, E-Rock?  I know you're well-rested and ready for more Opie and Anthony abuse,  but this one is a very obvious one.  That's a good question. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I bet you didn't oversleep to get some good sales in.  Yeah.  No, I didn't go to sleep at all.  I stayed up all night.  Oh.  Why?  Because you couldn't wait?  You couldn't wait to get to that store?  Nervous anticipation?  I needed luggage.  Of the big sales?  Were you fighting for that toy?  The one toy that everyone's fighting for?  Were you running down the aisles trying to get one of those toys?  What is the big toy that everyone needs this year?  That's got to be some version of Elmo.  No, I don't know.  It wasn't anywhere near the place. 
[00:17:00]  Is it an Elmo?  It is some version of Elmo.  No, I don't know.  Yeah, there's like a laughing his ass off Elmo or something.  That was last year.  Nah, it's different.  What's the big toy this year that all the stupid housewives are going to fight over and  kill each other over?  Gets up on his feet.  Does it dance?  What is it?  Also, the Wii.  The Wii.  Of course.  The Wii.  The Wii.  Video games.  Stupid Wii.  Yeah.  See, when I want to exercise, I go to the gym.  When I want to play video games, I play video games.  It is funny. 
[00:17:30]  They're kind of trying to say that the Wii is good for physical fitness.  Right.  And they're getting old people to use it at the old folks' home.  Because you swing your little Wii control.  What's the cute name for it?  The Wii-mote.  The Wii-mote.  The Wii-mote.  Yuck.  The whole-mote.  The Wii-mote.  The Wii-mote.  And the nunchuck?  What's that?  It's the add-on piece to the Wii-mote, so you can use two hands. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  But they're saying that like that.  Have you ever gotten some really good exercise using the Wii?  No.  The Wii?  No.  Not even playing tennis.  I mean, you're swinging a little remote.  It's not running around a court.  Yeah.  Really getting any good cardio out of it.  The Wii-mote weighs a quarter pound.  How are you going to get any exercise moving it around?  Swinging that around.  Right. 
[00:18:30]  The Wii-mote.  I have to wait by a console game until GTA comes out.  Then I'm in.  And then what?  But it ain't going to be a Wii.  When is GTA coming out?  March or May.  I always get those months confused, as we all know.  When asked on the stand when my wedding anniversary was by a certain lawyer, I couldn't remember  because I couldn't remember March or May.  And I looked like a douche.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  How are you doing today? 
[00:19:00]  Pretty good, man.  Dude, Eli Manning's the worst quarterback in the league, hands down.  I'm not going to argue that, man.  He's no Peyton.  He's no anything.  He looks like my high school quarterback.  And we were, like, always 10.  And you were always 10.  How many interceptions yesterday?  Three, was it?  Yeah, four.  Three got run back.  Three got run back.  Yeah, four total.  Okay.  Everybody's saying, oh, you've got to give him time to blossom.  He's going to be great. 
[00:19:30]  I mean, how long does this guy get?  Just get rid of him.  See, I've never, ever, ever been a Giants fan.  I hate Big Blue.  Hate Big Blue.  Always have.  Are you a Giants fan?  I've been a Giants fan my whole life.  And they're getting pretty embarrassing to watch.  It's just hard.  I can't even watch a game.  I'm just disgusted.  Well, I mean, you've got to watch the Jets if you don't want to be embarrassed.  Oh, that's even worse.  And the two teams combined probably couldn't even have a decent team. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, we're having another rough year here in New York as far as football goes.  Eli Manning looks like, he just looks scared every time he makes a mistake.  He doesn't look like an NFL quarterback.  He looks like he should still be in high school.  Yeah, he's like Manning's, he's like his retarded brother.  He has that face.  Eli needs to grow like just a big beard or something.  Something manly.  But I don't even think he can grow any facial hair.  That's the problem.  You need your quarterback to look grizzly. 
[00:20:30]  His facial hair doesn't connect.  Can we get a couple tattoos or something?  Yeah, get a tattoo.  Absolutely.  Do something.  On your face?  Yeah, get a freaking, like your name on your neck or something.  You know, it's a script.  It has to be in script or it's not cool.  It has a teardrop in the corner of your eye to look like you're in a gang.  Hey, don't mess with that teardrop stuff.  You know what the, uh.  Don't mess with the teardrop.  You got to kill somebody to get well, yeah.  All right.  TCB.  If I saw Eli Manning walking down the street, I'd probably shoulder check him right into the wall. 
[00:21:00]  You know what the, uh.  He's always scared and you know.  Yeah, he needs some tats.  He needs, uh, he needs just a big awful beard or something.  Something going on.  Go like, go like with one of those mustaches that go all the way down on the sides.  Right, yeah.  Like something that makes him look like he's a quarterback.  And his brother was there yesterday watching the game looking like a superstar.  Right.  That he is.  Right.  And he's, you know.  Hiding in the corner.  He was hiding.  Yeah.  You know he put a hood on after the game. 
[00:21:30]  How great would it be if he snuck in there for his, uh, his awful brother?  Too bad they didn't look more alike.  You know, he could sneak in there.  Like, during halftime they do the old switch of rope.  Yeah, you know, because at least Peyton, he looks like he could rough somebody up if  he got mad, you know?  Oh, Peyton could, uh, do some damage.  Yeah.  He was just like, oh, come on, guys.  Come on, guys.  Stop.  Come on, guys.  Yeah.  All right, brother.  You know what, uh.  Enjoy.  You know what seems to be a trend that's going on with the black guys? 
[00:22:00]  You need the dreads to come out the back of your helmet like the Predator.  Oh, that's it.  It's the Predator look.  Look, and I'm seeing it more and more.  Yeah.  They're growing those, like, dreads out or putting, like, massive amounts of braids in.  And then they put the helmet on and it hangs out.  You can't even see the name on the back.  And you just wait for him to take it off.  It's better back in the old days, they'd take the helmets on and it'd be the shape of the 
[00:22:30]  inside of the helmet.  Well, that was kind of funny, too, with the afro.  And you'd have, like, the straps inside the helmet embedded into the afro.  You'd have Rydell on the back of his afro.  You make a point there.  Maybe the Predator look is better.  All right, listen.  Yeah, go ahead, Bobby.  No, I have nothing.  All right, Bob Kelly in for Jim Norton.  I think Jimmy's out there in La La Land doing some stuff.  I think he's doing the Gene Simmons roast that's going to be taped and thrown on A&E  in the near future.  Was this spur of the moment?  I think so. 
[00:23:00]  Because I was like, oh, Jimmy was out, but I knew he was doing Thanksgiving stuff.  And then I read today, oh, Jimmy's not going to be in.  Jimmy's not in for a few days, but we got Bobby Kelly and maybe we'll get Patrice tomorrow.  And I don't know, we'll figure it out.  We'll have some good times, good times.  Of course we will.  All right, phone's lit, man.  We'll go right to the phones after a quick break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Hi, good morning.  Opie and Anthony, Bob Kelly.  During the break, we were discussing the Pats a bit more. 
[00:23:30]  I really want to see them go undefeated.  And then we were discussing years.  And Anthony was amazed that Bob Kelly said 86 bears.  Well, I'm always amazed that people can go like, oh, yeah, that was like the 68, whatever.  Or, yeah, that was back in 74.  Like, I can't remember or be bothered with a year as far as a team goes and what they accomplished.  But you were amazed by that.  And as a sports fan, there are years you just know.  Like, 86 bears, I think, is one of those years you should know. 
[00:24:00]  Like, you know, 72 dolphins.  You know, 86 bears.  You know, well, because we're from New York, 69 jets.  Yeah, that I remember, I don't know, 86 Mets, though, is pretty much.  For New Yorkers, 86 Mets?  You know, that's where 86 and sports ends.  2004 Red Sox?  No.  You just know.  I couldn't have told you the year.  Oh, yes, you can.  You don't care about it.  Yes, you can.  I don't know about it.  I don't care.  I don't know this team.  I don't know what they do. 
[00:24:30]  But there's just some years.  Oh, there's a million Super Bowls.  You know, give me a year.  I couldn't tell you who won the Super Bowl.  Who cares?  Yeah.  But I know 72 dolphins.  I know 86 bears.  Trying to think of a few other years that just pop in your head like that.  I mean, there's certain guys that annoy me, that are, like, so stat-oriented.  Dude, who's the new guy on your team?  I don't know.  Then you're not a fan.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Freaking jerk.  Everyone's yelling it was the 85 bears.  But didn't they win the Super Bowl in 86? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, they won it in 86, you moron.  They played in the 85.  They did, right?  I just know it was the Super Bowl shuffle year.  Yeah, they're being technical.  Why are you handing me a note, the 1927 Yankees?  Are you insane, Travis?  One of the most famous baseball teams ever.  You're going back to, like, when people wore those big hats.  Those big stovepipe hats.  Did you use your Wii as a time machine?  Look, if you had to go to a stadium in a suit, it doesn't count.  If you had to, like, if you had to buy a ticket and you had to wear, like, a really nice hat and an overcoat and a tie, and that's how people dress, then it doesn't count. 
[00:25:30]  The only film of the players are in fast motion.  Like, wow, they're running around.  If a girl blew a nose and you could hand her a napkin.  Right.  Yeah, here it is.  All right, Travis, why don't you tell us about the team?  1927 Yankees.  Fantastic.  Here we are at the stadium of the 1927 Yankees.  It's quite exciting to be here.  Let's talk with young Travis, a fan of this Yankee team. 
[00:26:00]  What have you got to say, Travis?  I can't win.  How come your mic is so much better than mine?  What happened that year?  The president was still throwing the ball out.  The president throwing out the first pitch.  That's wonderful.  Don't have to worry about people taking pot shots at him from the stands.  Let's start a little thing.  If you go to a sporting event and there's so many people smoking that you can barely see the action on the field.  That's wonderful.  What's happening out on the field? 
[00:26:30]  The smoke is...  It doesn't count.  Thank God, because nine out of ten doctors say it's soothing for the throat.  Right.  It doesn't count.  What happened that year, young Travis?  I don't know.  Then why is it important?  You said it's one of the greatest Yankee teams of all time.  Name four Yankees, because I know you'll be able to name maybe one or two.  The Iron Man.  Name four Yankees for the 1927 Yankees.  And stop looking it up.  Babe Ruth.  No.  Well, I'm not a Yankee fan, so I would guess Ruth. 
[00:27:00]  Well, you ran in with that.  No, boy, don't forget about the 1927 Yankees.  Because as a baseball fan, you're conditioned to kind of know that.  But I would say Ruth.  Gehrig.  Uh-huh.  Someone named Spunky.  Spunky.  I'll say Yogi Berra.  Yogi Berra?  Yogi Berra's still alive.  You idiot who's playing ball in 27. 
[00:27:30]  That's 80 years ago.  He'd be dead at a door now.  Call you Scribski.  Go with Joe DiMaggio, I believe.  No, I wasn't DiMaggio.  I believe DiMaggio was part of Murderer's Row.  Murderer's Row?  Right, they were called Murderer's Row, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Put that lady with the big hat in front of you.  But one thing assured, not one Negro.  Jesus.  Not on the field either.  No.  Yeah, if there's no Negroes, then that year doesn't count as far as sports goes.  The year doesn't count, because we all know you can't play ball without some Negroes. 
[00:28:00]  And some Puerto Ricans, too.  Yes, Dominicans, whatever.  They're all just white people trying to play baseball.  Well, here's the great team of 1927.  1927, who do we got?  Julie Berra.  Ah.  Mike Cozella, Pat Collins, Eddie Bennett.  Eddie Bennett coming to the plate.  Oh, wait, wait, Eddie Bennett was the mascot.  Oh, Christ.  Benny Ben...  Ben...  Ben how?  Because the one person I picked to go to the plate, and it's the mascot. 
[00:28:30]  Ray Moorhart.  Yeah, this was a great team.  What was the mascot?  Polio?  Miles Thomas.  Cedric Durst.  Who are these guys?  Cedric Durst!  Who are...  Cedric.  What the...  Now coming up, Cedric.  All right, here's some people you know.  Lou Gehrig.  Ah, yes.  All right, let's not forget...  That of that horrible disease that was named at them.  What a coincidence.  That old gag.  Let's not forget Herb Pennock.  Tony Lozeri. 
[00:29:00]  Wiley Moore.  Babe Ruth, of course.  Don Miller.  Bob Sharkey.  Oh, there was no DiMaggio?  No.  Oh.  No, they had reached their Guinea quota.  From the sound of you reading that list off, my God, a lot of Italians on the team.  God bless the Italians.  God bless the Italians.  Indeed.  But we don't want the Irish.  1969 Mets.  There's another year you just kind of know. 
[00:29:30]  Especially if you're in the New York area.  I just know Tom Seaver was on that team.  Tom Seaver?  Yeah, Tom Seaver, like...  What a jerk.  I hate Tom Seaver.  You don't like Tom Seaver?  Don't you remember back in my BAB days?  You were at the game?  I was at that game, yeah.  The radio station decided to get our silly radio softball team to play, I think it was  the 1969 Mets.  They were doing a promotional tour where they played softball, right?  So, here we are just rock jocks. 
[00:30:00]  We're just rocking the long hair and smoking cigarettes in between innings and stuff.  And we're playing the 1969 Mets in front of like 200 freaking people.  And I get a massive hit off Tom Seaver playing softball.  So, the next time I'm up, he hits me like really hard with the softball.  He was pissed.  Like, dude, chill out.  It's like for charity.  We're trying to...  He beaned you.  Threw at your head?  He threw at me.  Jesus.  And then charged the mound? 
[00:30:30]  The team got back at the Mets, though.  Huh?  Who was that animal that you worked with?  I forgot.  He knocked out one of the 1969 Mets.  He hasn't been the same since.  He like barreled them over at home plate.  He just like...  He leveled them.  Totally leveled them.  I forgot who it was.  It might have been Jerry Grody or, I don't know, some old timer that was like just trying  to do the right thing, playing a little charity softball.  And yeah, one of the guys from the BAB days just leveled them at home plate.  They pretty much carried them off the field. 
[00:31:00]  It was a violent game.  It was for charity.  Did you charge the mound when he threw at you?  He thought it was hilarious.  That would have been funny.  He started laughing.  Yeah, he hit...  Take a swing at Tom Sear.  We were playing slow pitch softball, and I crushed one.  I don't remember.  It wasn't a homer or whatever, but it was a really good hit.  So the next time up, he actually wound up overhand and hit me.  He threw it overhand.  Overhand.  And hit me.  What a bastard.  He put his fingers across the creases and hummed it at you. 
[00:31:30]  You didn't charge the mound?  I would have went right at him.  It would have been great to see a long-haired, thin, rocking jock just go after a fat reel jock.  Somebody got the job done.  I wish I could give him props.  I forgot who it was.  But yeah, he took out somebody at home plate, one of the 69 Mets.  It was someone at the station like a moose or a tank or something like that.  It might have been Tank.  Tank.  Big guy.  It might have been Vinny the Van Driver. 
[00:32:00]  Poor guy's hearing aids just flew out of his head.  Of course, 69-70 Knicks.  Yes, there's another one.  We're doing all the New York years and teams, but there's other ones for other cities.  Yeah, basketball.  I couldn't tell you about.  Yeah, 85-86 Lakers, Celtics.  All right, let's say hi to Andy in Brooklyn.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  What's going on?  Hey, huge fan.  I just wanted to let you know about this Wii game.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  You guys are saying that it's not physical?  Yeah.  All right.  For about eight years, I was a professional full contact fighter.  Okay?  And when I put on that boxing game and I play my eight-year-old, I am breathing like a  frigging pig after about three or four rounds.  Does your left arm go numb and tingle?  And are you having chest pains, too?  Maybe you ought to go see a doctor.  If you're sweating on the Wii, there's a problem, sir.  I would think the boxing game, you would probably get a little bit of a workout. 
[00:33:00]  Let me tell you something.  To this day, I'm a gym rat like yourself.  I'm in my 40s.  I go seven days a week.  I'm a psycho when I go to the gym.  Total endurance junkie.  Yeah, but do you wear the big gray sweats that make your package look nice?  Is that at all necessary?  My sweatpants that my chick wants to burn.  I'm like, what?  They're comfortable.  But when I'm doing my back braces. 
[00:33:30]  They're pup-telling.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, what?  They're wigwaming.  Why are all the desperate housewives looking at me?  From their stupid cardio machines.  It looks like the coach in Greece.  I know you also made reference to the briefs.  Yeah.  The best briefs to work out in.  Under Armour has come out with these briefs that have enough room for the package.  They keep everything else really in place as you become very active and sweaty.  Yeah, the Under Armour crap is just amazing, but whatever. 
[00:34:00]  That's not going to make great radio talking about that.  But, Andy, so you get a workout playing the way, right?  I do.  And, listen, it's a shame that Jimmy wasn't on because I really had some constructive criticism for him because I'm a huge fan.  And when I seen his stand-up, I was kind of, I almost felt uncomfortable for him.  He ain't going to want to hear that.  Why would you feel uncomfortable?  Well, you know what?  Like, I see other comics, and they look so like Louis C.K. or even Bob Telly there, who's, you know, visually kind of a mess. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know.  We get it.  I get it.  Jesus.  Thank you.  This guy's like that jock guy that walked up to the counter in Clerks and just started like, yeah, right?  Can't wait until his kid comes.  So how much can you binge?  His kid comes downstairs at, like, 5 in the morning, and he's naked on the Wii, just trying to get a workout.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Andy.  We got to move on to some other people here, but thank you.  Jimmy's comedy was great.  His HBO stand-up is special. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, nothing but props.  Uncomfortable.  That's the way Jimmy looks on stage.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Keith.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How are you talking about Tom Seaver?  I was at Shea Stadium at the Diamond Club, you know, the restaurant there?  Yeah.  Yep.  And I was in an elevator, and I happened to be in the elevator with Tom Seaver.  And a little kid, probably like six years old, comes up to him in the elevator and says,  Mr. Seaver, can I have your autograph?  And he's with another guy in, like, a suit, and he's like, out of here, kid, can't you see 
[00:35:30]  I'm working?  In the elevator?  That's the kind of guy, yeah.  Wow.  In the elevator, a little kid.  Like, that's the kind of guy that he is.  I've heard things over the years.  I've heard things over the years.  I say, F. Tom Seaver and F. Jane Seymour.  Ooh.  There you go.  I haven't forgotten.  Both in elevators, by the way.  That's right.  Wasn't a sign of a kid's autograph.  Stupid Jane Seymour.  That guy bugged me.  All right.  Jim Norton.  I know.  That's stupid.  You know what people don't understand, though?  No at all.  Jimmy's one of these guys that writes new material all the time. 
[00:36:00]  And you know what they're used to?  They're used to seeing a guy who's been working on an act for 16 years, and he's got it down,  and then they go see him, and the next time they bring all their friends to go see him,  he maybe has some new stuff or whatever.  It's like, you can't please him.  You know?  It's like, Jimmy writes more than anybody I know.  Yeah.  Anybody I know.  He's one of the funniest guys out there, and his act is always evolving.  And you might catch him, or you first see him maybe a couple years ago, it's totally  different than he is now, what he's talking about. 
[00:36:30]  He's got a girl now, he's talking about different stuff, but you can't really criticize a comic  for that.  You have to understand the process.  He's henpecked.  He's what?  He's henpecked now.  Well, you gotta be.  Well, you know.  But he's, he's, you can't, you can't, usually the tour he's doing now, he's working on a  new hour.  Yeah.  He probably went and saw him working on jokes.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt and Basher.  So go screw.  Yeah.  Matt, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Bobby's such a little putty now.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I can't do this half of the radio. 
[00:37:00]  I really, I'm sorry, Tom, I apologize.  All right, Matt and Basher, what's up?  They have a button.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Really quick, man.  I love you guys.  I'm sitting in the flood on the Hutchinson Parkway driving to work.  The 69 Mets, man, they traded away Nolan Ryan.  Yep.  And the other thing is about that Wii game, man, they freaking have a bowling game, and  me and my girlfriend were out at my friend's house, and she was going underneath to roll  the bowl down.  She broke her finger on the coffee table.  You know what I'm saying, man? 
[00:37:30]  It hurt for a week, a week.  You know, but there's no lawsuit or anything like that.  Right.  And I don't know, man, but that game is pretty physical, though.  It really is.  It really is, man.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  I'll tell you, I got a kind of an elbow thing happening because of Tiger Woods golf.  Oh, is that it?  Pushing that mouse around.  Yeah.  Bloonk.  Pushing the little golf ball around.  Well, you want to see my technique, you got to go like this.  You got to move your whole body back and then forward.  Well it in. 
[00:38:00]  Playing Tiger Woods online, I'm obsessed with online golf now.  I'm obsessed with it.  That game is real addictive.  Tiger Woods?  It's real addictive.  You have to do like three things at once to get that ball off the frigging tee.  Yeah.  And once you get that down, you just want perfection.  Well that part.  Kind of playing online is a whole new story.  Yeah.  I just started this weekend.  You got to.  I am obsessed.  I'll tell your girlfriend goodbye.  Yeah, I'm obsessed.  Tell her goodbye.  Call of Duty 4 came out. 
[00:38:30]  Me and Dame came to my place for Thanksgiving.  Of course he did.  From 4 in the afternoon to 5 in the morning we played.  Really?  Yeah.  I was winning awards that you can't win unless you play for 12 hours straight.  I'm like a five star general.  Dude.  Some guy, he was in Germany playing like Tiger Woods online golf and he said the wrong thing  to me.  He's like, hey, you know, can you hurry up your play?  Oh.  And I asked if you were a Jew. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  And I write back, what are you talking about?  But I guess because of the connection, there was something that was going wrong with the  server.  It had nothing to do with me.  But he thought I was playing really slow.  And we were playing like novice, which is just all about just birdie, birdie, birdie,  birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie.  That's chicken birdie.  And you just wait for either yourself or your opponent to miss one lousy putt, and that's  the whole game.  And it takes no time whatsoever.  And the guy goes, can you hurry up your play?  I'm like, what are you talking about?  I'm not going slow.  Next thing you know, we're just trash talking in between each shot. 
[00:39:30]  I'm telling him to go F himself.  I'm telling him we're going to strangle him with my club.  I lose my mind.  Oh, yeah.  You get all mad.  It was my turn to hit, you know, so I do my stupid, you know, mouse thing, and then  right to the keyboard.  Or take that, ass.  But you have to do it in letters, because they'll kick you off.  So it's like, you know, F-U is F-Y and all that crap.  I can talk to the people that I'm playing with.  So I had to get headphones, because I lose my mind. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Because a little high-pitched Henrys would come in the room.  Dude, can we change the map, man?  This map stinks.  Come on, bro.  I hate this.  And you want to, I really want to go find these little kids and punch them in the face.  But I actually motivated my team, like General Patton the other night.  We were losing.  And I was like, come on, guys.  We can do this.  Look at you.  We need two guys to the left, two guys to the right.  We move in slow.  Who's got smoke?  Threw smoke in.  And we actually came back, and we won. 
[00:40:30]  And they were like, dude, thanks, man.  You were really good.  General.  Hey, we got a guy that played you.  Oh, Jason in Detroit.  You played with Bobby online?  No, no, no.  Stop.  I don't know his name.  I know his screen name.  What's your screen name?  Bobby.  What?  Mr. Stinks.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How are you?  I'm you stink.  Don't call me Bobby.  You call me you stink, too.  Oh, you stink, too?  Yeah.  Please don't talk to, refer to me in my real name.  Yeah, Bobby was like a flipping general. 
[00:41:00]  He was screaming at us, calling us losers.  That's great.  Didn't we come back to win?  We won.  We won.  And who's?  This guy was heckling Bobby pretty bad and calling him like a Canadian and a goat sniffer,  and Bobby and Dane just ripped this guy to shreds.  Oh, that guy.  Oh, this guy was bad.  Every once in a while, you get one of those guys in the room.  Mm-hmm.  Yo, what's up, man?  It's all you stupid people, man.  I'll kick it.  Oh, dude, it gets really bad.  It turns into, like, trucker radio. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Well, I play Team Fortress.  Team Fortress, too.  Yeah.  And sometimes you'll just hear, like, this whole team sucks.  The team I'm on just sucks.  And you realize that he's the one screwing everything up.  Like, he can't do anything right.  And he's running off by himself to just be incinerated by the flamethrower guy.  Nothing funnier than watching one of your teammates run around on fire.  And then body parts are just exploding in front of you. 
[00:42:00]  That's fantastic.  Well, you know, what's so funny on those things is because you can let people just go off and  scream at you for, like, five minutes.  And then right when they stop, you go, pussy.  And it just sets them off for another five minutes.  Yeah.  You can be so subtle on those headsets.  Could you shut up?  No one's great about video games is when you play it the right way for many, many hours.  And then all of a sudden, you start getting bored.  You're like, what can I really do with this game? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, I know.  I discovered with Tiger Woods, the nut shot.  It is hilarious.  It is hilarious.  Tiger Woods, you know, you got spectators.  The better you get, you got more spectators following you.  And you can freaking nail the guy right in the nut.  And they actually will kill over.  It's hilarious.  Make a good thud sound when it hits.  I was online.  I think it was on YouTube.  I think it might have been on YouTube.  Someone, like, you know, recorded the nut shot when they were playing. 
[00:43:00]  And I'm like, I got it.  There's no way that's real.  Here it is right here.  Watch.  I know this is radio, but here's the nut shot.  You just turn your aim toward the crowd and make sure you hit it nice and low.  And you can hit them right in the package.  That's what happens with every game, though.  That's what I'm saying.  Definitely have bored with it.  You decide, all right, well, we talked about the famous Sims,  how you turn into serial killers and stuff. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah, the old game, The Sims, where you just had to run the family  and it got pretty dull after a while.  You would just make a room and then you'd invite people in with, like,  cool things in that room and invite neighbors in.  And they would go to the room.  And when they're in there, you'd build another wall and just wall them in.  And they'd wet themselves.  They couldn't eat.  They couldn't eat so they would starve to death.  And then you watch them die and one person dies.  You watch them die.  And the rest of the Sims are all freaked out because now emotionally they're not okay.  And then there's a ghost in the house because there would be a ghost. 
[00:44:00]  If people die, you'd just see a funeral, like an urn, sitting there.  And then a tombstone would show up in your backyard.  And then you'd invite more people in.  You'd play serial killer.  And wall them up.  I used to play serial killer with Sims, yeah.  And then on Battlefield 1942 was one of my faves for a long time.  For years I played that.  And I would always grab a Corsair or one of the airplanes.  I got pretty good at bombing the enemy.  But then you'd get kind of tired.  So I would sit by the plane with satchel bombs and just put them under the landing gear and sit back. 
[00:44:30]  And planes were so hard to get.  There were only two on the board at some point.  And like 20 people wanted the plane.  So they'd fight for it.  They'd run.  A guy would jump in.  Start the engine up.  I'd hit the satchel bombs.  And he would just blow up.  You team killing MF.  It's just like screaming at you.  Sex with this girl.  I swear to God in Soldier of Fortune.  Oh, here's really fast.  Here's the crotch shot. 
[00:45:00]  I love the Dave Chappelle slow-mo.  That's pretty good.  You can check it out on YouTube.  Tiger Woods 08 crotch shot.  And we'll throw that up on onaradio.com as part of the show rundown later on today.  But anyway, why don't we take a break?  We can continue talking about this.  A lot of people call and say it was the 85 Bears.  So our whole discussion that we started is kind of for naught now.  It's stupid.  Now it's just stupid.  It was 85.  They're seasoned.  No, this guy, a few people are saying that the Bears won at 85. 
[00:45:30]  Maybe it was.  Maybe 86.  86 was the Giants.  That's why they know.  Oh.  86 was the Red Sox Mets, too, though.  Huh?  Yeah.  86 was the Red Sox Mets.  Yeah, that was a huge.  You might be right.  That was like a huge New York year because the Giants also won.  Did you see that one?  I was.  Well, look at this cross shot.  People just do this.  You can do this for hours.  Watch.  Here's Tiger Woods.  All right.  He lines up.  He's lining up.  And this guy. 
[00:46:00]  That is funny, man.  You can do it all day, man.  All day.  He grabs himself and his knees go in.  Right.  And he falls to the ground.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and continue here?  Phone number.  We got a lot of nice, a lot of phone action today.  Let's continue with that.  877-212-O&A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Want to say hi to Smokey the Steve. 
[00:46:30]  I get it.  Okay.  Smokey the Steve from New York.  On Instant Feedback, he writes,  My Favorite Sims Death.  Let's see.  You put a bunch of people in a small room with a fireplace with wooden furniture in the room.  Have them light the fireplace.  Then everything in the room catches on fire until the people in the room catch on fire.  And they scream running around.  Yeah.  The fires are always good.  It was always somebody that couldn't use the oven. 
[00:47:00]  And they would start a fire.  Yeah.  And have to call the fire department or burn.  And I would be like, ah, screw it.  Just let them burn.  I'll start over.  Burn, baby.  Burn.  Oh, God.  Everything you can think about is now on YouTube.  Because right away, EROC goes to Sims 1, Killing Part 2.  See, people have been doing this too, man.  I thought we were the only ones back in the day. 
[00:47:30]  That would make it more exciting, this game.  Hey, by the way, it's Cyber Monday, and Tim came up with this fine little thing.  Oh, no.  It's Cyber Monday.  Cyber sex.  We all get an opportunity to have cyber sex.  Cyber sex Monday?  Cyber sex.  Hey, honey, it's Cyber Monday.  Cyber sex.  Let's go private.  It's Cyber sex Monday.  I'm going to go to the Anthony show.  There you go.  Cyber Monday is in full effect.  We think it's Cyber sex Monday ourselves. 
[00:48:00]  Screw that buying crap online.  Have a little fun.  Cyber.  Go cyber.  Want to go private?  Me and you, we're going to go private.  Yeah.  What do you...  Has that ever worked for anybody?  Yeah.  What?  Look at that.  I don't mean...  Now, don't get me wrong.  I know it works technically, but has it ever worked where it's anything worthwhile?  What do you mean?  Like a relationship?  No, I'm just talking about anything you would want to even look at on cam. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yes.  We're not even talking about on cam.  Oh, I was talking about like...  Old school.  Oh, what?  Old school just typing?  He's talking words.  What the hell are you...  But people need to do that!  Send carrier pigeon, you nut.  People thought it was the greatest thing ever.  Yeah, back then.  And this is before the webcams.  They thought, hey, you want to go private?  And then you just type dirty crap to each other?  I never got it myself, but...  You had to keep typing, yeah, baby. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah, baby.  To keep her going.  It's ridiculous.  Because once you got it going, you had to let her know that you were into it.  Like, ah, baby.  And then you'd have to type, oh, God.  And you'd actually type in you finishing.  Ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga, ooga.  Why don't you just take your fist and go...  Right at the moment.  Type that.  This is me finishing.  Just punch the keyboard once.  Punch the keyboard and see what comes down. 
[00:49:30]  Send.  Let's go to Ginger in New Jersey, I guess.  Ginger, what's up?  I just wanted to say what an incredible turnoff it is to listen to all you talking about video  games.  Yeah.  You don't like when guys talk about video games?  Well, I kind of picture sitting in your mom's basement.  Well, what do you like to do?  That isn't true.  What do you like to do with the girls on your free time?  Like, trade baskets and stuff?  Are you one of those basket people?  No, I'm not a basket person. 
[00:50:00]  What do you do with...  I'm not talking about doing it with girls.  I'm talking about doing it with guys.  Okay, okay, hold on.  Let's get into this just a little bit.  Ginger, what do you do in your free time by yourself to entertain yourself?  A hobby.  I need to read.  I might go online and look at interesting subjects.  I don't play video games, though.  Well, you're missing out on a lot of fun.  What can I tell you?  The point is we're saying what you do stinks, too. 
[00:50:30]  That's pretty much the point.  Us watching you go through a magazine and fold pages of things you want later in life  that you can afford when you meet a guy that has money.  From four in the afternoon to five in the morning in my mom's basement, though.  It's never in mom's basement.  Wait, Ginger.  Wait, wait.  Ginger, why are you so angry?  Did you have a guy that spends all his time online or something?  I'm not angry at all.  I'm bored.  No, you're very angry.  I'm not scared to work.  No, I'm not angry at all.  And if you're bored with the radio show, there's a million choices out there. 
[00:51:00]  I'm bored with your radio show.  I'm bored with my commute.  I'm in the car first.  Why did he leave you?  Why did you leave him?  I have to do this now.  Ginger, so your boyfriend or husband played a lot of video games?  Absolutely not.  No?  Absolutely not.  I wouldn't allow him.  So did he try to?  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  So you don't know.  I don't think I'd be attracted to someone who would spend that much time. 
[00:51:30]  And I mean, how many times can you do the nut shot?  I mean, it's probably funny the first time.  Well, yeah.  I'm just talking about it.  I'm not saying we do it for hours on end.  Ginger, let's relax.  It wasn't like I sat there for hours doing the crotch shot.  It was just laughing each time.  It was just as hard as the first time.  That's great.  She thinks we're cavemen or something.  I know.  All it is is like, watch, guys, watch.  Watch, guys, watch.  Watch, guys, watch. 
[00:52:00]  I think you're a man hater.  Watch, guys.  Over and over and over and over and over again.  How about I try it two or three times and I thought it was hilarious?  300.  That was hilarious.  And Ginger, I would run circles around you with my intellect.  I read way more than you, but I also enjoy video games.  How do you like them apples, Ginger?  Ginger.  Why are you so angry?  I read a book a week.  You don't like men very much.  That's what I'm sensing. 
[00:52:30]  Ginger, Ginger, we play.  There's something more going on with you and you're not being honest with us.  That's why I'm angry because you're not being honest.  We play these games so we don't hit you.  There's something going on in your world that...  I'm telling you what's going on in my world.  I drive an hour to work.  I'm sitting and listening to you.  And so I formed an opinion about that and I thought I'd call that book.  Are you married?  Are you married, Ginger?  Can I just ask you a couple of questions?  Are you married or do you have a boyfriend?  I have a boyfriend.  For how long? 
[00:53:00]  Two years.  Two years.  How old are you?  You're around 30-something?  42.  42.  All right.  And you have a boyfriend.  And does he play video games?  No, he doesn't.  No.  What does he do?  What does he do for a living?  What does he do for fun?  He's an investment banker.  Mm-hmm.  Of course he is.  I hate that title.  Excuse me.  Sometimes he does play a game on his Blackberry.  Oh, on his Blackberry.  On his Blackberry.  That's all I allow.  What game does he play on his Blackberry? 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  Are you a little overbearing, Ginger?  Yeah, I don't really know.  Are you a little overbearing?  Not at all.  Ginger, what do you do?  What do you do, Ginger?  Yeah, what's your job?  What do I do?  Yeah.  I'm in management.  Management for what?  It could be anything.  I got to tell you, I don't like you.  You know how you can talk to someone for a couple minutes and you form an opinion that's  very accurate?  I don't like you.  I hope nobody likes her.  Okay.  I don't like her.  Her boyfriend doesn't like her.  I'm really, very well like her. 
[00:54:00]  I don't think you like her.  No, you're not.  I don't think you like yourself.  Nobody likes you.  You met us three minutes ago.  We already don't like you.  The interns don't like you.  I don't like everybody.  I would love to see if you could turn my opinion around of you.  I don't think you can, though.  There's something about your voice and just how you present yourself.  I don't like you.  I would never hang out with you.  You would probably like me.  Yeah?  Why?  Why?  Because you got big boobies and we're cavemen and we like big boobies and doing crotchets. 
[00:54:30]  Watch, guys.  That's all we are, right?  Actually, I don't.  Grown men playing video games is a turnoff.  Well, that's what she says.  Yeah, it's the one kid.  I mean, but isn't that okay to have that opinion?  Of course it is.  Of course.  I think you're lumping everybody into one category.  There are the geeks that play in their mother's basement and never leave and, you know, just  sit there and don't have a job or anything.  But then there are people that, you know, are into the technology of the whole thing, how 
[00:55:00]  cool it is, the different types of games.  You're just lumping it all into one category.  People who play video games actually use more of their brain and it takes more brain power  than reading a book because you have to use your thumbs, your fingers, your brain, your  eyes.  You're using every sense you have except for smell.  Can't wait for that to come out.  You're doing a lot of thinking.  What does it matter if you're only using all that to play more video games?  What'd you say?  What does it matter if you're only using all that knowledge to play more video games? 
[00:55:30]  But only to play video games.  Like, you just don't understand it.  So you're, you know, you've never played any.  And let me tell you something.  If the terrorists happen to come to New York again, guess who's going to survive, honey?  Me.  General Robert Kelly.  That's right.  And don't forget, I can do a little damage with my crotch on.  Crotch on, watch, guys.  Watch, watch with the mouse.  There's another one.  And then Anthony will make an elixir.  I could cast a spell. 
[00:56:00]  With my wizard.  All right, Ginger, we're going to, like, have to agree to disagree.  We'll have to agree that you're a tool.  Yeah, and you could talk a terrorist to death.  And you might be a lovely woman.  I don't know.  I just know I don't like you.  Yeah, nobody really likes you.  All right, Ginger, have a good day.  Okay, sorry we didn't entertain you on the way to work today.  Don't crash.  Let's go to Joe in Michigan.  Joe, what's up?  Nothing.  I think Ginger was pretty cool.  I mean, as far as the tool goes.  Either way it goes, I got to tell you, I met my wife online on accident on Pogo, if you  all know about Pogo. 
[00:56:30]  What's Pogo?  It's a gay-ass website now where you play cards or any other game you want to play, and  you just act like a fag, and then you meet apparently a wife.  And then you're miserable the rest of your life.  Oh, wow.  The whole meeting online thing didn't work out for you?  Um, not particularly.  I'm in the car driving my children to work, my twin boys, and my wife just got dropped  off, accused me of being fucking wasted when I...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait, first of all... 
[00:57:00]  I think he's got two dumps.  First-time caller, long-time listener, and I do apologize.  Yeah, well, try not to curse if you call a show.  We want a lot more people listening to this.  I got you, I got you.  There's a bunch of people that get to hear the curses, I understand that, but we want  everybody to hear it.  I feel...  So what, you're driving your two sons to work right now?  Uh, no, not to work.  I mean, to school, sorry.  How old are they?  They're five.  Oh.  Are they real, or did you make them online?  I did not make them online, unfortunately.  If they were made online, I could, like, totally, I don't know, two damage them, and they would 
[00:57:30]  be gone, but...  And your, uh, and your mom, and your mom, what is wrong?  And your wife accused you of being wasted this morning?  Yes, she did.  I didn't sleep barely at all last night, and my lovely wife, who I met online, accused me  of being drunk, and I wasn't.  I just didn't sleep.  How many years have you been together since meeting online?  Five.  Five, five, one year.  Oh, he's miserable. 
[00:58:00]  This guy's miserable.  Yeah, I'm like, hey, mom.  Huh?  I'm happy.  Oh, are you?  Yeah, we sound it.  She's a fan.  I made her one, um, but, uh, she won't ever hear this, because I'm not gonna let the replay  play on, uh, XM tonight.  Because you might get in trouble?  More than in trouble.  Probably, like, uh, divorced.  Oh, gosh.  I just had to release, finally.  I call you guys all the time, and I never got through.  I just had to release.  Let me ask you something.  Hold on, hold on.  Why are you staying in the marriage if you're not happy?  The kids. 
[00:58:30]  The kids.  I love my kids.  They're in the back.  Oh, you hear this all the time.  God, people sacrifice for their kids.  They just sacrifice.  I saw people.  Yeesh.  I made this observation yesterday.  I was in the mall.  I was telling Lindsay.  I'm like, she was in, uh, Victoria's Secret, so I'm sitting and just kind of-  Oh, I wish I was.  Oh, shut up.  I'm, uh, and I love, I love watching people.  It's one of my favorite things.  I could sit on a street corner and just watch people all day long.  And I'm watching couples in the mall yesterday, and I didn't see one happy couple with a  kid.  No. 
[00:59:00]  Not a one.  I think they just thought it would be different.  No, no, no.  Their instinct to procreate and keep that wonderful name of theirs going, that fantastic bloodline  that you see walking around the mall, to keep that going throughout history is more important  than their own happiness.  So it's this self-sacrifice martyrdom that people feel compelled, uh, to, to, to procreate 
[00:59:30]  and have kids.  It's, it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  It's, it's, why, what is so important about your goddamn bloodline?  Can I say something?  Who cares?  Let it peter out.  Are you going to have kids?  I was, I always thought I was going to, I always thought I was going to, and the more  I'm, I've been married for a month now, I've been with her for 10 years, the more we're  together, the longer, and the people we see and these couples that are walking around and  her friends that are married with kids and the people with kids and only even my own family, 
[01:00:00]  Anthony, I think you're right.  They're all miserable.  I don't know.  I don't care about my name.  I don't care about having a little me around.  I always thought I did.  I want a little, but then people say when you do it, your whole opinion change.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like falling asleep next to the bean pod in invasion of the body snatchers.  Everyone's afraid to do it.  Oh my God, it's horrible.  And then you wake up and you go, it's great.  Fall asleep next to the bean pod.  And everyone tries to get you to fall asleep next to the bean pod.  I'm not falling asleep next to the bean pod.  I am fall asleep next to the bean pod. 
[01:00:30]  I understand you have a completely different take on it.  That's fine.  I'll give it a shot.  Plus, you know what?  I think that not having the pressure of money and stuff will help too.  No, it won't.  I think it will.  I don't think it will.  I think it will.  I don't think it will.  I think it will.  I don't think it will.  He's right.  He's right.  Because it's never, it's not never.  Because I see a lot of couples that have kids that can't really afford them, and that's  a major stress in the relationship too.  And you can hire somebody to come in.  You can hire a lady to come in.  You're right.  If you have the money.  I think I'm lucky.  I think that helps a little bit. 
[01:01:00]  You're just going to get a nanny?  Take care of the kid?  No, no, no.  I've always wanted to.  Throw a ball to him on the weekends?  No, let it be known.  I've always.  Mr. Opie, what do I do with the baby?  I've always wanted to be a father.  It just never worked out in my life until now.  The thought of that just sends shivers up my spine.  I'll tell you, having a kid.  Being a father.  Long.  Sad part is, and I say it every time, he would be the best father in the room.  I'm great with kids.  First of all, kids love me.  You would teach your kids really cool stuff.  Yeah, it would be fun. 
[01:01:30]  Like what?  Like how I'd abandon them so I could go to the Caribbean for a month.  How to sharpen a Hitler Youth knife?  Yeah, exactly.  My interest in World War II.  You would probably.  Twist his little mind.  But you would probably have like cool kids.  Like there are people.  Probably.  There are people out there that end up having cool kids, don't mind being around them because  they're cool.  Like they get the whole thing.  You know?  I've seen that too.  Too much self-sacrifice for what I see as no upside. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  I see no upside in the kids.  Let me get back.  So at the mall, like I'll sit and then I'll play little games.  And yesterday was, I'll play little games with myself.  Yesterday was just studying couples and see if I could find one couple in the mall that  were happy with a kid.  And I didn't see one, unfortunately.  No.  I saw just a lot of miserable people.  Like no acknowledgement.  The couples are walking and there's kids of all ages.  And the couple is not even acknowledged that the other one exists.  No.  It's over.  They're like living through their kids. 
[01:02:30]  Like they're both kind of paying attention to their kids but not to each other.  The other game I love to play is Short End of the Stick.  And I think I'm short end of the stick now.  So I don't like playing that anymore.  Oh, you definitely are.  You definitely are.  Oh.  Okay.  Who got the short end of the stick?  You got a leaf that was on the stick.  Thanks, Bobby.  Thanks, Bobby.  Who got the short end of the stick?  It's not your fault.  You went for an 11.  I used to play Short End of the Stick all the time.  And it's not fun anymore when you're engaged to an 11. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, God.  Short End of the Stick.  Short End of the Stick at a mall is hilarious to play, though.  Because it's so obvious.  You see the couple coming.  You're like, who got the short end of the stick?  And you can get it every single time.  It's never like, ooh, this is a tough one.  Yeah.  It's always like a fat, balding guy with like a five-foot-eleven gorgeous blonde and whatever.  Thanks, Bobby.  Not even thinking.  Oh, dude.  You definitely. 
[01:03:30]  You didn't even pause on that one.  Her eyes make you.  You could take a body part from her.  Bobby doesn't know.  Half a lip.  Bobby doesn't know how to act around my chick.  It's hilarious.  Well, because I can't.  Like, well, I saw you backstage at the Dennis Lurie and Friends thing the other night, a  week or so ago, and he just falls apart every time he runs into Lindsay.  I'm better now, because I really like Lindsay a lot.  But she's also, she's so pretty, and her eyes are so crazy.  And she, you know, they're like, I mean, I've never seen eyes like that. 
[01:04:00]  The blue, I don't know, what are they?  Blue, blue, ocean blue, devils.  All right.  Gorgeous blue.  Aryan blue.  Is that what it is?  And she, you know, she's such a down-to-earth, you know, her personality is like, hey, what's  up, Bobby?  Blubby.  But when she looks at you, it almost mesmerizes you.  And then you get weirded, because you're like looking at Opie's chick's eyes, and you're  like, and then you can feel Opie coming up like a panther on like a kill from yesterday.  So I always try to look away. 
[01:04:30]  You've left, he looks away awkwardly, and I've seen him leave the area a couple times.  Like, where are you going?  He goes, I can't hang out here anymore.  I can't be around her.  Your chick is too hot or something like that.  I can't be around her.  I can't be around her.  Because you wind up, it happens all the time.  She's just so pretty.  Like, hey, what's going on, Lindsay?  Oh, my God.  Is she looking at me?  Was that something?  Did I, I gotta go.  I gotta get out of here.  You're nuts.  Oh, yeah, this girl, we want to say hi to, Aspen in Maine.  I wish that happened with my girlfriend. 
[01:05:00]  My wife.  You said girlfriend and then wife.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Aspen, what's up?  Not much.  How are you guys doing this morning?  Were your parents big skiers?  No, my mom just says my head's as thick as an Aspen.  She can't get anything through to me.  So what's up?  Yeah, I get a lot of crap from my name.  All right.  Well, what do you got?  Well, actually, I bought a PS3 because I date on MySpace and in order so I don't have to entertain them, I let them come over and play my PS3 hoping that maybe after, like, you know, something will happen. 
[01:05:30]  It's kind of funny.  Oh, there.  So you got, like, a built-in entertainment device at your house.  Is it attached to your back?  No.  Wait, so you bought a PlayStation 3 just to help pick up guys?  Yeah.  I don't want to put the effort into it because I'm just, like, you know, I'm single, I have my life set, you know, I got nice stuff, and, you know, I do home theaters and audio systems installs for a living, so. 
[01:06:00]  People are saying she's ugly, fatty.  Aw.  How fat are you?  See, people, just based on what you said, people are now assuming you're fat.  Well, check out MySpace.  What is it?  All right.  What is it?  It's aspen.armani at yahoo.com.  She's smoking.  This is her, Iroh?  Oh, my God.  Hey, listen, I need a home theater system put in on Mondays when my wife is working. 
[01:06:30]  That's you with the Freddy Krueger shirt on?  Uh, no.  Striped shirt?  Oh, God, no.  No, check out, like, 4th of July.  4th of July?  4th of July.  Is this the girl, Iroh?  Wait, what's wrong with this girl?  That's not you.  That's not her.  It is.  Wait.  You can even ask me, Iroh.  Okay, that can be you.  July 4th, baby?  Is that you?  Yeah, that's me.  You look wasted.  Who cares?  Oh, yeah, I was.  Are you all drunk?  Your eyes are a little far apart, but besides that, you're pretty good. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, well, thank you.  My eyes are all messed up.  You're all geared up for a TF.  TF.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's got some.  You do that.  You good?  I don't like a...  I have a good plan going.  That's disturbing.  Don't have to do that.  Well, she is geared up.  But I never want you to show me with your hands again.  I had to.  You had to stick your tongue out and look at me that way?  You know I like you, Bobby.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she's not a fat guy. 
[01:07:30]  She's smoking.  You're all right, man.  Aspen with the PlayStation 3 to pick up guys.  There you go.  Aspen, can I come over and play?  Sure, anytime.  Where do you live, Boston?  I live in Maine.  You got a good supply of games?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I have a friend that works at Sears, so, you know, I get hooked up.  You are hooked up.  How many entertainment centers do you sell a year?  Like two, one?  I'm actually, today I'm going to wire a $10,000 low-voltage job and install a $70,000 system 
[01:08:00]  in the end of it.  But it's pretty fun.  It's fun to get to work in a million-dollar home.  It's got to love it.  You are smoking.  Well, hit me up.  I'm getting this communique that you're the master of the MySpace angle pick.  That's a few steps above the MySpace just show the eye pick.  Yeah, we, I love girls with, like, really pretty eyes, and they put them on MySpace.  And that's all they show?  I'm looking at another picture of you, and it's showing off a little more hurt.  Why? 
[01:08:30]  Which one is that?  The one where you're with some kid in his swim trunks, and you're in front of lockers.  Your shoulder's a little wide.  Wow.  That isn't me.  And then you got, like, your arms are kind of like lunch lady arms.  Lunch lady arms.  I actually have huge arms.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Is that a tat on your belly?  Well, the tat on the belly is to hide the fact that she might need to do a few crunches. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, that really does look different.  You know what?  Cancel that.  Cancel that entertainment center.  And make sure you don't hit up my MySpace.  MySpace, go to my website, eatabullet.com.  All right, I'm punching out.  All right.  All righty.  Thanks for calling the show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show on this Cyber Monday.  It's Opie and Anthony show on this Cyber Monday. 
[01:09:30]  for people you don't really care about.  We finally went with the Secret Santa type thing for the family. 
[01:10:00]  We've just had it after decades upon decades of dragging boxes and bags of wrapped gifts  for everybody and their friggin' cousin over to Grandma's house every year.  So the living room is just completely full and it takes hours to unwrap them.  And finally, we all decided, look, put everyone's name in a bag, pick one name out, and that's 
[01:10:30]  who you've got to get something for.  Wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, I thought you were going somewhere else.  Wait, all these years you had to buy for every single sibling?  Every sibling, dude, every relative that came over, cousins, aunts, uncles, mother.  What's wrong with your family?  We did this, dude, we did this as long as I can remember.  We went Secret Santa, oh God, it's got to be 10, 15 years ago. 
[01:11:00]  And guess what?  Now we went no Secret Santa.  Now it's all about just getting some gifts for the kids, like my sister's kids and my  brother's kids.  That's it.  That's it.  I don't need to buy my brother a gift every Christmas.  I'm sure he'd like one.  Trust me, they get their gifts.  Jesus.  Trust me on that there, Bobby.  I kind of hate it now because I don't get anything. 
[01:11:30]  You're hard to buy for?  Well, I mean, I buy everything.  When I want it, I buy it.  As soon as it comes out, I get it.  See, that seems to be a problem with people.  I was at the mall yesterday and a lot of stuff that would have been great gifts for Christmas.  Take these off the list because I just bought them all.  My girl gets mad at me because I...  I was like, why don't you wait for Christmas for that?  It's like, why would I wait?  I was in the...  I want this now.  I spent my whole childhood and adolescence and early adulthood waiting for stuff that 
[01:12:00]  I wanted.  I have to wait for you to go to my account, take money out and buy it for me with my money  and then give it to me as a gift from you.  Get out of here.  Every year, my thing is right after Thanksgiving, I have to hit them all.  Not on Black Friday, though, but the weekend between Thanksgiving and this Monday where  we're up to, I have to just hit them all and just get, all right, just get situated.  Like, I have to walk around them all and go, all right, okay, I see what's going on here. 
[01:12:30]  Just kind of scope it out and get ready for the crap that's coming.  I give everybody money.  The pressure and the stress and all that.  Yeah.  Oh, I just handed out American Express gift cards.  Yeah, that's great.  I was like a dealer, like a blackjack dealer.  That's what it came down with us, too, because you're trading.  You're like, all right, you're handing out gift cards.  They're handing you gift cards.  It's like, why don't we just call the whole thing off?  I'm giving you a gift card.  You're giving me one.  We're even.  Done. 
[01:13:00]  $800 billion last year was not spent in gift cards.  Oh, I know.  It's a racket.  Yeah, they get you.  Because if you don't use them, they expire.  Where do you get your numbers from?  Look it up.  If I'm wrong, I will buy you a gift card.  $800 billion worth of gift cards.  I know that I have at least three or four gift cards I never use.  At least.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's $700 billion something something.  You find them like years later and go, oh, damn.  And they're.  Oh, Circuit City. 
[01:13:30]  They're so smart because they, what, expire in a year and they know a lot of people are going  to forget.  A year's going to go by like that.  I don't think they can expire anymore.  I think they passed them off.  Oh, they made some kind of law?  Yeah, because that's a real scam.  Yeah.  It's like, you got the money.  It's money that's there.  Right, right.  It's in your company and you get to expire cash.  People just lose them.  Oh, what is that?  Iraq is pointing out a stat.  Amanda Walker, money advisor, said this year, approximately $8 billion in gift cards will  never be used. 
[01:14:00]  Thank you.  How much did you say?  I said $8 billion.  You nailed it.  Wait, were you reading all that?  No, I didn't read that.  I didn't nail that up.  Why did you know this?  I told you.  What do you think, I'm Voss?  Didn't you say $800 billion?  No, he said $800 billion.  I might have said $800.  You said $800 billion.  Did he?  Everyone's saying he said $800 billion.  You know what?  This is the worst part about this show.  That's like a portion of the national debt.  You have like, it's almost like they're little Matrix losers just listening and typing to you,  Anthony, letting you know everything that happens. 
[01:14:30]  That's exactly what they did.  If this was a regular radio show, I'd get away with that.  You can't get away with anything.  Neither can we.  Not on this show.  You listen to every word.  He said, how fast did you type that in?  8-0-0.  He said 8-0.  I did.  I said 800.  But you know what I meant.  I broke my Neo, man.  I broke my Neo.  The Steve sounds.  We got to get back to this real fast because we got two new ones that came in.  Here are the Steve sounds.  One of the guys that works for us.  And when he's doing his production, he warms up his voice by just making ridiculous sounds like this. 
[01:15:00]  What?  And this.  And this.  And finally.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Why does he do that?  Do you have the sounds the other guy made?  So, good old Coke Logic started a little thing, and it's continuing. 
[01:15:30]  Coke Logic took a couple of those sounds, and he made this.  It's quick.  Oh, she's a big.  Oh.  She might to my tag.  Just letting it all hang out.  Oh, she's a big.  Oh.  Oh.  I like Maryside.  And that's a fact.  I ain't holding nothing back.  Oh, she's a big.  Oh.  Well, look together. 
[01:16:00]  Everybody knows.  This is how the story goes.  Oh.  So, Coke Logic started.  I love that.  And then our own fan and Danny came up with this one.  And then a listener sent in this one. 
[01:16:30]  And this is Cradle of Milf.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I love that one.  A kiss song, obviously.  I didn't realize. 
[01:17:00]  And then we got two new ones today.  We got Cody in Indiana came up with one.  And then another guy.  But first, here's Cody in Indiana, what he did with the Steve sounds.  Some people call me the Steve.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Wait for it.  Let's see where this is going.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  You knew it was coming. 
[01:17:30]  It's just the stupidest things on this show that take off.  And then finally, we got Chris in West Virginia.  He came up with one that was worth playing today.  A lot of these are coming in, by the way.  Most of them not making the cut.  This is Chris from West Virginia.  Oh, I didn't realize. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize.  What? 
[01:18:30]  There you go.  What?  There you go.  Very good.  And the listeners are doing these perfect.  They're nice and quick, to the point.  Yep.  I mean, these days, we all have ADD.  You can't make this stuff too long or people are going to put it out.  Damn, that's funny.  God, Steve, what is wrong with him?  I didn't realize.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh, I don't even know what that is.  I don't know why you would do it.  I don't know. 
[01:19:00]  He's like a retard.  What does that do?  I didn't get rid of all ears.  What does that do for your throat?  I don't know.  So you could be a voice guy for promos.  So you have to start by, oh, I didn't realize.  Steve has a very deep voice when he's doing production for the show, but that's how he  warms up his voice.  I bet he has a little doll in his backpack.  That's the voice for the little doll.  Oh, they don't make fun of you. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, they don't realize.  Yeah, it's kind of like an Adam Sandler, like, yeah.  Mike, Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, Bob Kelly, listen, you know, it's the game.  What?  Dude, call back.  Oh, he said Bob Kelly's an idiot.  Oh.  But someone is pointing out that the best one still to this day is the Steve Don't  Worry, Be Happy.  Did you ever hear this, Bobby?  No.  It puts everyone in a good mood.  We haven't played in a while. 
[01:20:00]  We should play it.  It's quick.  More of Steve's sounds.  My favorite part is when it kicks in right out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  It's harmonizing, Steve, now.  There you go. 
[01:21:00]  It just gets everyone very, very happy.  That's the great Drew Boogie, right?  Of course.  I call him the great Drew Boogie now.  Shut up, ringtone, sweeping Spain.  Yeah.  Who cares here?  Like, who cares here in the United States?  It's a big story.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Apparently, someone said shut up over there, and they decided to make it a ringtone.  But to me, it's just gibberish.  It's just Spanish.  I don't understand it.  I don't either, but I never understood ringtones until I started using some of the sounds from 
[01:21:30]  our show.  Yeah.  And then I finally started getting the whole ringtone thing.  Our show makes great ringtones.  Like, just the Steve sounds and songs and stuff.  Oh, that's how my phone rings.  That one.  Yeah, that's the one I use a lot.  There's one ringtone that I hate because of you.  Which one?  Banana phone.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Yeah, but I didn't get the whole ringtone thing until, like I said, yeah, when we started 
[01:22:00]  incorporating the sounds of the show.  Before that, I'm like, why would I, like, get my favorite song on my phone?  Yeah.  Or, like, you know, I don't know, like Cartman or something.  I just couldn't be bothered.  But it's a huge industry.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  God.  But this is what Spain's all about.  Por que no te callas?  Why don't you shut up?  Por que no te callas? 
[01:22:30]  That phrase stilled the rage on Spanish cell phones.  Por que no te callas?  Two weeks after Spain's King Juan Carlos told Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to shut up.  Por que no te callas?  Por que no te callas?  Hundreds of thousands here have downloaded the ringtone.  Por que no te callas?  The king said it.  Onto what?  Their tin cannon strings?  Jesus.  Cell phones are huge all over the world. 
[01:23:00]  Way bigger than...  You ever talk to a cell phone guy in one of those dumb stores?  No.  They will educate you.  They say in Europe, like, people buy cell phones, like, every four months.  They're obsessed with their cell phones.  And it's like, they always have to get the latest one.  And they're pretty much going through two or three cell phones a year easy.  Easy.  They get better cell phones, too.  They get the cell phones first before we get them.  They do.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, every once in a while, you'll find a cell phone store.  And I'm like, yeah, this one's really hot in Europe.  And it's going to be hot in another... 
[01:23:30]  That dumb pebble.  Yeah.  Which never really took off in America.  I got the pebble way before anybody else, because the guy's like, I'm telling you, this  one's huge right now.  It took off in Europe, but here, it's like, you know...  It didn't take off.  It's like, hey, zebra's big in Europe, too.  Yeah, it looked like a rock that you put your chopsticks on.  Band.  Huh?  He's like, zebra.  That's a band.  Oh, the band.  Yeah, yeah.  The king said it, says this student.  He got it on his phone last week from a friend.  The Spanish mobile and internet company Zed says the shut-up ringtone has been a record 
[01:24:00]  breaker in sales.  Everybody knows the king.  Secondly, I think that it was something which was very human.  I think it was from his gut when he reacted, so it was emotional.  And I think that it was kind of funny.  It's so weird.  It's kind of funny.  It's just so weird how things take off, though.  Yeah.  You know, this is like, this stuff happens all...  It's not particularly telling somebody to shut up, but you know what I mean? 
[01:24:30]  Just some dumb thing.  And it's like, why did that dumb thing take off?  Yo, how come that took off?  Like, why that?  Yeah.  What made that huge?  Like, everyone at the same time said, yeah, this should be huge.  That's how it works.  It's so bizarre to be.  It's anything in pop culture.  Right.  Like, why did that take off?  Why that?  This said specialist prepared the shut up product, downloading the King's audio from  YouTube, and then adding special musical effects.  It's something that King said, and very well said, to Chávez. 
[01:25:00]  This is going to stay with me forever, until my phone breaks.  But this cell phone industry analyst thinks most consumers are more fickle than that.  The market is geared to the moment.  What's in demand now?  People could be very interested today, but not next week.  Why don't you shut up? 
[01:25:30]  I've been told that myself a few times.  Why don't you shut up?  Spaniards seem to be silenced by you.  There you go.  I mean, that's, uh...  Let's not forget, it's Monday, and we do our own thing here on Monday.  Yes.  Well, we do that one, too.  It was like, what?  Well, that's...  We do Pod Talk Monday, and we do this Monday.  So we try to get ringtones out there. 
[01:26:00]  Maybe one of ours will, like, just take off a little.  Yeah, who knows?  I love that ring-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding one.  I think my crotch shock thing from earlier, that was a fine ringtone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it might work.  I'm more of a purist.  I just go whatever is on the goddamn phone. 
[01:26:30]  I don't really need, like, special ringtones, but...  If you got, on your phone...  Yeah.  ...the old-school phone ring-in, stop.  You're not original at this point.  Every other...  You have it, too, right?  I have that one.  That is probably...  Huh?  Ew.  What is wrong with you, Bob Kelly?  You have the old-school phone ring-in.  That was like, when you first heard someone have that, like, wow, that's cool. 
[01:27:00]  That's the one I want.  It's different.  It's original.  Right?  No one has it.  Everyone has that one now.  One of the most popular ones.  My ringer wasn't on, but people call to get it ringing.  What is yours again?  Mine, uh, ringing...  The xylophone?  No, I don't have the xylophone.  You're a little limited with, um...  You can make your own now on the iPhone.  Yeah.  And call mine right now.  I forgot which one I'm using these days.  Call you? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, I was doing the Steve...  What's your number?  Uh...  Okay.  That would be funny.  I don't even have Opie's number.  Okay, here.  I'm calling you.  All right, hold on.  I just turned my phone off.  See, a little picture comes up of Opie.  See?  Ew.  Ew.  That's creepy.  Okay.  Hello?  Well, I just turned my phone on.  All right.  Oh, hello?  Is it really ringing?  Oh, it just beeped.  Oh, I think I have an incoming call.  Hello?  Uh, hello? 
[01:28:00]  Bobby, call my phone.  I want to see what my ring is.  I just wanted to call you.  Why can't I call?  You didn't call me, Tony!  All right, we'll take a break, then.  Don't worry.  You're calling me?  Yeah.  Oh, that's Anthony's voicemail.  Now, calling you.  All right, hold on.  Oh, wait.  I'm here.  What the hell is going on?  Oh, I got your voicemail.  Oh, my God.  Hurry up and call my phone.  Call me.  It's on vibrate.  It's on vibrate. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is Ben snoring.  Still one of my faves.  What is that?  Huh?  What is that?  That's actually Ben snoring.  Yeah, it was him snoring.  The boys hates him in a hotel room snoring.  All right, we're going to take a quick break here.  We'll get into other things.  See what else the world is talking about.  What do you got?  What is that?  What is that? 
[01:29:00]  What is the ringtone?  I like this one.  That's what I used to wake myself up with.  Funny boner noise.  Funny boner noise.  That's funny.  Oh, boy.  Ginger's not liking the show right now.  Talking about video games and boner noises.  Oh, sonar ping and scary sci-fi.  That's not scary.  I'm petrified. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, by the way, I know we got to take a break.  Someone calling me?  By the way, I finally saw The Departed.  Oh, finally?  What, a year too late?  Did you like it?  It was all right.  Yeah, it wasn't one of Scorsese's best.  I don't think he should have won the Oscar for it.  Hell no.  There's so many other great movies.  But it was okay.  I wasn't bumming that I watched it.  It was one of those movies. 
[01:30:00]  Just had to put it back to it.  Just had to put it back to that one.  Everyone's like, guys, you're on the radio.  Why are you calling each other?  Because it's funny.  And Fast Freddy's like, are you guys stoned?  It's Pot Talk Monday.  That's right.  Relax.  Whatever.  But The Departed just missed.  One of those movies that just missed.  All-star cast.  Great storyline.  And I was like, what was the big deal?  What was the hype all about with this movie?  It was dumb.  It was dumb.  You know what a good movie? 
[01:30:30]  No Country for Old Men.  That's what everyone's saying.  Dang God, what a movie.  That's a good one.  See, Ginger, we go to the movies too.  We go to the movies in between our video gaming.  That had to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.  That guy, Javier.  Javier.  Javier.  He is.  He plays the psychopath.  Just a.  Yeah.  But he's likable.  For some reason, you're rooting for him.  I don't know how he did it.  But he is unbelievable.  What a psychopath.  What's the movie about? 
[01:31:00]  It's about.  I think it's from the 80s.  It's.  And this guy stumbles across a drug deal gone bad in the middle of nowhere in Mexico or Texas  border.  And he winds up just taking the money.  And this guy, whose money it is, he comes in and he just eliminates everybody.  But he does it in weird ways.  He has a.  It's like a thing they kill cattle with.  They put it on the top of the head instead of shooting them. 
[01:31:30]  It just.  Yeah.  It puts a bolt through.  It puts a bolt.  It just goes.  That's how they.  That's how you get your burgers.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  All right.  This guy, it has a, like a big three foot CO, you know, a big gas canister.  Yeah.  He carries around with them.  So he has this, this canister.  He's walking up to a hotel room with this big canister and he opens doors with it too.  He just puts it up to the lock and.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it blasts the lock out.  Blast the lock out.  I ain't got to see that.  That's that.  And the other, his other tool of destruction is a silenced shotgun. 
[01:32:00]  And it's just the coolest sounding thing ever.  Just the sound of it.  It goes like this.  Funk.  Funk.  Funk.  It's just death.  Oh, he, he is one of his hair.  He's got a bold beetle, beetles haircut.  So he just looked and he's wearing, you know, tight eighties clothes, like a little, a little  tight dungaree jacket and a tight little slacks.  And he's, he's just a psychopath.  I got to go see it now.  Uh, let's go to Charlie.  Charlie, what's up?  Really good.  Hey man. 
[01:32:30]  Uh, you don't like to the party.  What's up with the departed?  That was one of my favorite movies last year.  No.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I didn't say I didn't like it.  I just thought it was, it was going to be better than it was.  If that makes sense.  I, I feel, I know what you mean.  And, uh, I didn't think it's, I didn't have that kind of vision.  I'm a big movie buff.  Ben, uh, I'm telling you, you gotta watch it more than once.  You really do.  Maybe it was the, the, the, all the hype or, I don't know what it was, but I was expecting  more, I guess.  No country for old men, by the way, 95% positive ratings on RottenTomatoes.com. 
[01:33:00]  Wow.  That is massive.  That is massive.  Unbelievable.  People don't like the ending.  I'm telling you, it was amazing performances from Wahlberg and Gabriel and you got Nicholson  in there.  All the good guys, man.  All right.  I'll tell you what happened with the movie.  Wahlberg's hairpiece took me out of the movie.  It looks so stupid.  Really?  It wasn't like, I don't know what they were.  It's the first time hearing of that.  It was like a, it was like a, like a wig or something.  And it looked like he was getting ready to do a high school play.  But that's why it's so good. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  But it wasn't, that wasn't part of his, his characters.  Like they messed up.  I don't know why they had to do what they did with his hair, but it looked like he was  getting ready to go on stage at a high school.  You know how you have to look the part in high school and they put some dumb wig on  you.  It looked ridiculous.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  And I don't know if it was a wig.  It was just how the, the hair took me out of it.  I just can't buy DiCaprio as anything.  He was great.  He was all right.  DiCaprio was great in that movie.  I think he's all right. 
[01:34:00]  He, he, he, he, he mediated, he just mediocre in films.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just like, is he really, what range does he have?  He makes that little angry brow face when he goes a little angry and he squishes his  lips together when he's mad.  That's Matt Damon.  No, Matt Damon doesn't have much range.  Are you out of your mind?  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Born identity.  Was he born supremacy?  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Thanks. 
[01:34:30]  He seems to play the same freaking character every single time.  Matt Damon.  That's right.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  I would take a Matt Damon movie over a Leonardo DiCaprio film any day.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  I watched Ocean's 13 last night. 
[01:35:00]  Oh yeah?  Was it good?  I almost ran to that over the weekend.  Don't bother?  You know what?  It's just, it's one of those just stupid, everyone ensemble cast, worthless, wastes of time.  Pacino's just, Al Pacino has lost everything.  He has just lost everything.  He's a parody of Al Pacino. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, if you think so.  Yeah.  Hey, you think you can do it?  Give it a try.  All right.  We get it.  What happened to, like, there is some point in his career he went from Michael Corleone,  which was cool Al Pacino.  One of the badass.  One of the, to this old guy who just kind of talks funny.  It looks like he's doing, he looks like he's doing an SNL character in the last, like,  10 films he's done.  It's like he's doing a parody of himself like everybody else on SNL does. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, he doesn't, it's, he just got rid of that old Al Pacino guy that everybody liked.  And stop with the Botox.  Your face at this point doesn't move.  It's creepy.  It turned into this.  It turned into this.  Everybody out.  And then you watch that movie, what was that movie where he had insomnia?  Was it called Insomnia?  Yeah, it was called.  I was just thinking that when I said, was that movie where he had insomnia?  What was that called?  It was Robin Williams.  I want you to read what Pal Tuck's saying now.  Well, at least I picked up on it within a second. 
[01:36:30]  By the way, everyone, I was watching that and, and, and he had like nail fungus and talk  about taking you out of the movie.  That one just took me out of the movie.  And now every time I see.  Nail fungus took you out of a movie?  Dude, his fingernails were black.  And they'd show like him, they should have a handstand in at that point.  They'd show him giving somebody something.  And now every time I see him, I just think, ah, my nail fungus.  Vince Vaughn has the same, his thumbs.  Really? 
[01:37:00]  I'm mushed.  Mushed.  I'm not, I can't watch a Vince Vaughn movie anymore because I'm staring at his thumbs.  Yeah.  And he hides his thumbs.  Watch any interview.  He hides his thumbs.  Does he got one of these?  What is that?  I got a mushed thumb.  It's just.  What is it?  No, no, dude.  That's my birth defect right there.  It's a little mushy.  It looks like a toe.  Yeah.  It's not, it's not really bad.  It was.  His, he was in a car accident and his thumb was like shredded.  He's got the Radar O'Reilly syndrome where you're just looking, trying to look at Radar's  goofy, frigging, not developed hand and mash. 
[01:37:30]  I never knew that.  Oh yeah.  Yo, it was awful.  He has this little baby hand that's all crumbled up.  And that's why he always holds a clipboard or something.  He never shows that hand, but sometimes it sneaks out.  He never played the game.  Let's try to look at that thing.  Look at whatever that is hanging off a Radar O'Reilly's forearm.  He'd walk into every scene with a clipboard or something, hiding that thing.  I know that mole used to bug me.  Oh, the one right betwixt the eyes.  But no, he's got like this claw, little baby hand. 
[01:38:00]  And it's, it's so.  Oh yeah, man.  They hit it through every episode and used to play, let's try to see that thing.  Oh, what's that movie where the guy gets thinner?  Thinner?  Thinner.  Oh, smart asses.  Wow, he's not kidding about Vince Vaughn's thumb.  What's wrong with him?  Wait, where is it?  Wow!  Who knew?  His thumb is.  God, I'm not close enough.  Look at that.  Yeah, let me look.  That's effed up, man.  Who knew?  What happened to Vince Vaughn's thumb? 
[01:38:30]  He's got no thumb, dude.  Oh, now you ruined Vince Vaughn's movie.  Yeah, now we've got to look for his weird thumb in our movie.  Okay, so it's Al Pacino's fungus.  Right.  Gary Berghoff's baby hand.  And Denzel's pinky.  Denzel's pinky?  Denzel's pinky?  Denzel's pinky.  What's wrong?  Put in Denzel's pinky.  It takes a mean left.  It takes a mean left.  Hey, we're real late.  We can continue with this after the break.  We'll throw a lot of these pictures.  Celebrity defects.  We'll throw a lot of these visuals that we talk about on this show up on ONARadio.com later today. 
[01:39:00]  That's what we do, because I know we do a lot of visual stuff on the show.  And then we throw it all on ONARadio.com so you can see what we're looking at during the radio show.  All right, you don't have to call about that No Country for Old Men or whatever it's called.  Everyone is saying how awesome the movie was.  I mean every single person online right now.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll continue.  Oh, that's the mark. 
[01:39:30]  Opie and Anthony.  And Bobby.  Where's Bobby?  Where did Bobby go?  Where did Bobby go?  Come here, Bobby.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  877-212-ONA.  Hey, Blobby.  Where'd you go?  Oh, you went to go puff.  Huh?  No, I didn't.  No?  Good boy.  No.  Hold on.  You just went for a run?  A little jog?  No, I just ran from the door to here and I'm out of breath.  Where were you?  Yeah, I went to the bathroom.  To the latrine. 
[01:40:00]  Down the hall?  I've been washing my hands a lot lately.  I get into this habit.  Anyone go in this bathroom today?  No.  There's like a little, there's like a little like raisinet that just will not flush down.  Just like stuck to the side of the bowl.  It's the worst when you know you haven't gone to the bathroom all day and then you come home  and there's one of those in the bowl.  And you got to look at your girl like, come on.  Come on.  Did you leave that in there?  Just, you seriously, I want you to be a magician with your ass. 
[01:40:30]  Well, go look in that bathroom.  It's like one of those bad moles you see on some people's faces.  It's just sitting in a bowl staring at you.  John Boy Walton.  Right.  It's like a tick that's full of blood.  By the way, you're so right about Denzel Washington's thong.  Oh, wow.  I mean, Pinky.  That could be one of the best celebrity deformities I've ever seen.  All these pictures.  You'll help onaradio.com today there, E-Rock.  Okay.  All these pictures will be up on onaradio.com later. 
[01:41:00]  But we're talking about, I don't know, deformities.  And Denzel Washington, Bobby pointed this out to us.  And it points completely down to the ground if his hand was on his chest, let's say.  It takes a mean left.  Yeah.  Take your pinky at, like, the knuckle.  You can't do it.  And just bend it.  It is a sideways until it cracks and is facing down.  It is.  Like, if you went to shake someone's hand, put your hand out to shake someone's hand, 
[01:41:30]  your pinky would be facing the ground.  Yeah.  It goes out halfway and then cracks down.  It is almost a 90 degree angle.  And it's long.  It's really, like, long, that extra.  It looks like, that looks like something they could just fix with an operation.  Yeah, why don't they fix that?  I saw him trying to load a gun in Man on Fire, I believe it was.  Oh, no.  And he was flipping that, he was flipping it around.  Trying to.  Flipping.  He was flipping it around, trying to get that bullet in the gun.  And I was like, what is that? 
[01:42:00]  Look at that.  What is it doing?  And it's giant around the ankle.  Like, I think he might have been born with two.  The ankle.  I mean, the knuckle.  Sorry.  I'm freaked out by this.  It looks like he might have had two, like, pinkies growing.  Like, his pinky was growing, and then all of a sudden, a little pinky just shot off out  of the side of it.  The knuckle in that area is twice the size of all the other knuckles.  Yeah.  You never see him shake hands in movies.  But why couldn't they fix that?  They should be able to fix that. 
[01:42:30]  Who gives a crap if it doesn't move?  At least make it look right.  You're Denzel, for God's sake.  Fix that.  Let's say hi to...  Oh, man.  Someone had a funny line, but he's gone.  All right.  Let's go to Sean in Philly.  Sean, what's up?  Yo, celebrity defects.  Stephen Colbert's freak ear.  Does Stephen Colbert have a freak ear?  Yeah, Stephen Colbert's ears aren't the same.  A piece of Jimmy Dean's sausage.  Sausage.  Sausage.  One of them is smaller and sticks out. 
[01:43:00]  You've seen it.  Yeah.  He's shown it on his show.  Oh, he openly admits it?  He makes fun of it.  All right.  Let's go to Tim in Buffalo.  Tim, listening on the edge.  The home of Shredder Reagan.  What do you got, Tim?  I just wondered if you guys have ever checked out Val Kilmer's elbow.  What's wrong with Val Kilmer's elbow?  Yeah, he's got a tumor on his elbow.  Stop it.  How do you know this stuff?  He rocks Val Kilmer's elbow.  What's that movie he was doing with Al Pacino and...  Find me Val...  And De Niro.  And De Niro.  Heat.  And Heat.  I thought it was like a choice as an actor. 
[01:43:30]  I want a tumor on my elbow.  It is disgusting, dude.  Why didn't he get a drink?  Let's see Val Kilmer's elbow.  We're looking for Val Kilmer's elbow.  I didn't notice that.  My goodness.  Who's the liberties?  Well, we can't really find his elbow yet, but we'll take it.  It had nothing to do with the movie, Tim.  No, he busted it up filming the doors.  He did a stage diving scene and they dropped him.  So, yeah, it's kind of there for good now, I guess, but...  Oh, it's bad, too. 
[01:44:00]  Daryl Hannah?  What's wrong with Daryl Hannah?  She has half a finger, her index finger.  She lost it in the pulley of a well?  How old is she?  Jesus.  She's getting well water?  What do you get?  What do you get for trying to be green?  Yeah.  You'll lose your finger.  Someone is saying, look up Bobby Kelly's planet belly.  Fast Freddy.  It's the closest one to the sun.  You know what?  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  This is very local, but I have to go with it. 
[01:44:30]  The Islander's TV girl's mouth is crooked as S.  And doesn't move.  Like, she's got some kind of like...  Why?  Because she talks like it kind of goes crooked.  Does it?  A lot of people in...  It's a little too local, but...  On TV now, if you notice this, the guy on Heroes, the guy who can fly, the kid who can fly,  and the chick on Dexter, their mouths, it's like they had a stroke.  Really?  Because a lot of people on TV with like their mouths...  Because they're pushing that Botox strap.  Stay away from the Botox.  Botox, Smug Guy, on Channel 11 News. 
[01:45:00]  Smug Guy's got a mouth that kind of goes, meh, meh.  See, it's curtains for you.  Oh, curtains.  Meh.  Maybe you're in the oven, huh, Rabbit?  All right.  Famous celebrities that have missing fingers and stuff.  You got Gary Berghoff from MASH.  Who's Donald Deke Slayton?  I don't...  He's an astronaut?  Space, yeah.  Okay, these are just famous people in general, didn't they?  Bobby wouldn't know that.  He doesn't like space questions.  Wow, you really knew that one? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  I know some astronauts, but I didn't know...  It's not the original Mercury 7.  Wow, Jesus.  All right.  Jerry Garcia, yes, I remember that one.  Tony Iommi, yes.  He's missing, what, a finger, right?  Chunks of two fingers on his right hand.  Chunks?  What do I...  You don't miss chunks of your finger.  In an industrial accident.  Boris Yeltsin.  Well, is the...  We're talking about grape stains now, too?  Was Boris Yeltsin the one with the big...  Nah, no.  No, that was...  What? 
[01:46:00]  Gorbatschop.  Oh, Gorbatschop.  Right, right.  Gorby.  Are we going with the...  It's hard to look at Gorby with that grape juice on his head.  I kept trying to dab it off.  I have Alzheimer's, so I forgot it was one of those, well, stains.  Oh, my God.  They're coming in like crazy now.  Do we go with this bit?  Check out relief pitcher Antonio Alphen...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Ding.  What was that?  He has six fingers on both hands?  What the hell is going on there? 
[01:46:30]  Who was that?  That's John Travolta with his hair weep.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We've seen that.  But do you have the picture of him bald that they have on the internet?  Really?  There's a picture with him with no wig on, and he's balder than me.  Really?  He's got a hole in the back and nothing up front.  He's got like a little baby curl.  Wait, what's that?  Come on.  It's Photoshopped.  No, dude.  No, he's bald.  But that's for a movie, that picture.  Don't take away my hair.  Right.  Let's go with Brandon in New York.  Brandon. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, I just want to comment.  I try to look at ESPN.  Stuart Scott's on, and I cannot turn away from that guy's glass eye.  Yes, Stuart Scott's got...  Is it a glass eye officially?  You know what?  I don't know.  He could just be cock-eyed.  I don't know.  But it looks like a glass eye.  Yeah, he got hit with a baseball right in his face.  Did he really?  He got hit with a baseball.  He was doing batting practice with the team, just messing around.  And he got right in the eye socket.  He almost lost his eye. 
[01:47:30]  I don't know if he lost it, but one eye stares straight at you,  and the other one looks at the text that he's reading.  It's actually pretty good for a news person to have that.  One of my first radio jobs, I was sitting down for an interview,  and the guy was behind the desk, and he had a lazy eye or a glass eye,  and I didn't know which eye to look at.  And I did the classic move where you move your whole chair to get in front of the eye.  Let me just get in front of this one. 
[01:48:00]  I try to make it, you know, because eye contact is very important in job interviews.  I'm like, which one do I look at?  And I'm like, I don't think that's the real one, man.  So I'm just trying to make it, like, not obvious that I'm moving my whole chair  so I can look into the other eye.  All right, guys, you're great.  Punch it out.  I got the gig, though, man.  This guy was all right.  He looked into the right eye.  I guess.  He chose the right one.  Let's go to Randy in New York.  Randy.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I don't know if you ever noticed it, but just take a look at a picture of Angie Harmon.  Her right eye is a lot bigger. 
[01:48:30]  It's like a big, giant medley eye on her face.  Hey, I'm looking at a picture of John Travolta,  and he's got kind of like the Phil Collins thing happening.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  I'll have to check that one out, Randy.  Thank you.  All right, see you, guys.  Yeah, he's got the Phil Collins thing.  Oh, yeah, he's his ball.  Oh, wow, look at that.  He's got the little spot left in the front, and then it's like.  He's got what I have right here, the little baby girl.  And then if you wear headphones, that's where your hair would start, way back there.  Wow. 
[01:49:00]  That's not Photoshopped or nothing?  No, he's bald.  That's him.  They had it on PTI one day.  But he looks all right as a bald guy.  Yeah, but you know what?  He wants the hair and the rolls, you know.  Huh?  So he gets that fiberglass stuff stuck to his head with hair in it.  Is that what that is all about?  I don't know.  He showed up.  It looks like fiberglass on the side of his head in that picture.  He showed up at an award show with short hair, and the next day he showed up with a wig  that was long.  So he just wore the robe, and they compared the two. 
[01:49:30]  Like yesterday, he had short hair, and apparently in one day, he grew three inches on his head.  Nice.  Let's go to Brian on Long Island.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  I'm a pitcher in baseball.  I get traded every year.  I don't know what team he's on.  Antonio Alphonse has got six fingers.  Yeah, that's the one that was coming up on his head back.  That should be illegal.  Especially if you're a pitcher.  There he is.  Let's see.  Is it freakish?  Oh!  Wait.  One, two, three, four, five, six. 
[01:50:00]  And he gets the pitch?  Shouldn't be able to pitch with six fingers.  That's got to be an advantage.  You could probably pull some shenanigans there.  That's got to be an advantage.  Wow.  He can actually make the ball hover over the plate.  I don't know.  How the F did you make it to the major leagues with six fingers?  Wrap your hand around that ball.  Damn.  Wow, man.  Oh, the Catherine Zeta-Jones one is coming in.  That one, too.  What's wrong with that?  Jay Moore brought that up.  What is it?  Oh, you wanted to go in?  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Peter, Massachusetts.  Hey there, Pete.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Catherine Zeta-Jones has a really nasty tracheotomy scar right down the middle of her neck.  Yeah.  She covers it up with...  She always wears some kind of a choker or something, a turtleneck, something to cover  it up, but it's a trache scar.  Sharon Stone has the same thing.  Does she?  Oh, a huge scar.  Only it's down a little lower.  I saw it in a movie.  Oh, I thought that was a trache scar.  Oh, she wasn't standing on her head? 
[01:51:00]  What happened?  So, why Catherine Zeta?  What happened?  What's the story?  Was she in a car accident?  She was a little girl.  She was a little girl, and she was choking on a giant piece of sausage, so they had to...  Come on.  That's not true.  Yeah, it's called Michael Douglas.  Yeah.  We can't...  Jessica from Jersey will acknowledge her call.  You know, one-testicle dudes, whatever.  We're talking about the stuff you can see while you're watching something you have.  Julia Roberts has three nipples.  Again, things we can see. 
[01:51:30]  I made that up.  Oh, okay.  Well, people will believe it now.  We already did radar.  Mick Foley's ear is messed up from wrestling.  Yeah, it's from wrestling.  Let's go to James in New York City.  James, what's up?  Yeah, speaking with the Islanders, the TV guy, Howie Rose, has got these fat rolls in  his neck.  It makes them look like a Thanksgiving turkey, man.  Very good.  Let's go to Charlie in Westport.  Charlie.  Hey, man.  If we're talking about deformities, you can't forget about Lee Corso's baby arm. 
[01:52:00]  Every guy in college, every college kid's got a sign holding up, Lee Corso's baby arm.  Totally lost.  Do we not know what a baby arm is here, boys?  No, who's Lee Corso?  Lee Corso, the college game day.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, all right.  I don't...  He's got a little baby arm hanging around his waist.  And does he...  Does it move?  Yeah, you know, it goes up and down, depending on...  It goes up and down. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, my God.  There's a guy...  We just went images on Google with Lee Corso, and there's a guy that baby photoshopped a real  arm where the baby arm is.  Look at that picture.  Oh, he probably pulls that up all the time.  Look at that.  I love his baby arm.  I'm not a huge college football fan, so I missed that one there, Charlie.  I know who you're talking about.  I recognize the guy.  I'll have to check it out now.  Oh, no.  It's a huge joke.  Thank you, Lee.  Thank you, Charlie.  Lee Corso's baby arm.  Will you add that to the mix today?  Thanks for giving a baby arm. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Let's go to Cors.  A little baby arm.  You always have to buy two sets of gloves.  We'll have all these pictures up on onaradio.com later.  It's very hard to face somebody with a baby arm.  Like, when you see him in the street and you make eye contact, but then you look away  real quick because you're afraid you're going to look at the baby arm and he's going to  go, he's looking at my baby arm.  There's a guy that we're-  I hate confident people with defects.  Like, people who can go out and-  Like, if I had a baby arm, I'd always wear something over it.  Wrap it up.  Yeah, I'd wrap it up.  You guys wearing a wife beater.  Like, I saw a lady-  It's outside. 
[01:53:30]  With these feet.  She had something wrong with her feet.  Her toes.  She had like-  A little hammer toe.  Yeah.  Like, the pinky toe was, like, mushed.  And then the other toe was, like, clumped together with this other toe and she was  wearing flip-flops.  It's like, you confident bitch.  You know what?  We're in contact with a guy that has two baby arms.  That's a baby.  And he has-  And he seems to be a nice guy.  Who?  We're in contact with this guy a lot.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah.  And the guy will wear a watch. 
[01:54:00]  And I want to tell the guy, don't wear the watch on the baby arm.  More attention is being brought to your baby arm.  How does he hold the phone to his head?  Does he have to mush it against the wall?  Baby arms.  He loves his iPod.  Tell him I loved him in Jurassic Park.  Right.  He loves him.  He's a T-Rex.  Oh, yeah.  That's a T-Rex.  He has a baby arms.  Steve and Queens.  He's a dinosaur.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Astoria?  No, I'm Aspen.  All right.  My old neighborhood is all, what, Greek now.  Astoria. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  What's up, Steve?  No, I just want to let you guys know that Alton Sika's nickname in the league is the octopus.  The octopus.  The octopus, yeah.  There you go.  Six fingers pitching in Major League Baseball.  That is not fair.  He should never lose.  All right, guys.  I'm going to look for myself.  All right, thanks.  Dave in Buffalo.  What's up, Dave?  What's going on, guys?  How about John Travolta's nose?  What's wrong with him?  You ever seen him at Pulp Fiction?  What's up with his nose?  What's wrong with his nose?  It looks like it's broke all the time. 
[01:55:00]  I never noticed John Travolta's nose.  Now we've got to go back to John Travolta.  Check it out.  Like, you know, when he's sitting at the table with Mrs. Mia Wallace there?  Yep.  Look at his nose.  It could be a bad makeup job, but the whole movie, it looks like his nose is busted.  I wonder if they threw a little nose piece on there.  I don't like Christian Bale, too.  He's got a nugget right by his eye.  And I can't watch him.  A nugget.  And they tried to always shoot him.  They covered it up pretty good in American Psycho.  Yeah, he was supposed to be perfect in that. 
[01:55:30]  The guy was supposed to be perfect, but he had that.  What is he got?  I used an exfoliating wash.  He's got a big nugget.  What's that?  It's like a nugget.  I don't know, like a risen nugget.  It looks like a ball.  Like those things that grow under your grandmother's armpit.  But it's, yeah, it's some kind of an old Eastern block country mole.  But it's right in his socket, right?  Right in the left of his eye, and it grosses me out.  A nugget.  Dude, the Eastern block growths are hilarious. 
[01:56:00]  I see them all the time in New York.  I'm like, what is different from where you come from that you got these abnormally, like,  misshaped, risen mole things growing off your body?  And it's always Eastern block country.  Eastern block.  My girl had a nugget right on her.  When I first met her, I had a nugget right here, and she got it removed.  Because it's not like bowls or anything.  It's just, like, raised, and it just has a life of its own.  You've got to love Chinese people, though.  Like, Asian guys, they'll embrace that nugget and let, like, just the hair fly out of it. 
[01:56:30]  Like, they'll just let it grow.  Nugget.  Like, three huge hairs just grow, and they have no intention of plucking it ever.  Well, let's not forget about the producer for the Opie and Anthony show?  No, no, no, no.  The producer for the old slot machine arm.  Hey, let's say hi to Paul in Boston.  Paul.  Hey, what's up, boys? 
[01:57:00]  What about the Joaquin Phoenix lip?  Joaquin Phoenix's hair lip is very nice.  Oh, yeah, that's a biggie.  Sniff.  Hey, let's say hi to, uh, we can tell that story after the break.  Oh, of course.  Uh, Cook, what's up?  Cook.  Yo, you hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  I got a celebrity defect.  Anthony Comey's adorable eyes.  Blink, blink.  Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink,  yes, Bill O'Reilly's producer. 
[01:57:30]  If you're going to talk about Anthony's adorable eyes that go blink, blink, let's not forget  about my charming cheekbones.  Ah.  I heard that all weekend long.  What's the matter with you?  What?  I just was talking about my charming cheekbones.  Let me see Anthony's eyes.  How about, uh, what's her name?  You've never seen his adorable eyes that blink, blink, blink, blink?  Um, Cindy Crawford, Cindy Crawford's a nugget over her lip.  Yeah, but that's kind of sexy. 
[01:58:00]  No.  Oh.  When she was, when she was, uh, like 20, it was sexy.  And now it's just, it's bigger?  Now you can just imagine, like, kissing her and feeling it.  Because you know later in life that's going to actually go pale.  And it'll still feel mossy.  Yeah, you see old ladies with those booty marks.  It'll be hairs.  And they go pale and they actually become, like, the color of skin and they droop.  Yeah.  Hey, let's, uh, we're in a speed round because we've got to take a break.  Let's go to, uh, Jesse in Jersey.  Speed round, Jesse. 
[01:58:30]  What do you got?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Uh, Owen Wilson's nose.  What's with that thing?  Like, right above where the nostril is.  Oh, you don't have to describe it.  You don't have to describe it.  Owen Wilson's nose.  Everyone knows about that.  Get the nose fixed.  Let's, uh, very good, bro.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars.  Hey, right at Van Susteren's mouth.  It looks like she's doing a ventiloquist back without the dummy.  She's got a stroke mouth.  What do you got on there?  Yes, sir.  Okay, sir.  Smells like hot garbage and sizzling. 
[01:59:00]  I'm Gretchen Van Susteren.  Okay, sir, sir.  He's in court today.  We're in Aruba right now.  Okay, sir.  Ah, blonde head whore died.  Let's, uh, end this with John in New York.  John, celebrity, uh, what, uh, defect, I guess, right?  Birth defect.  Yeah.  What do you got?  Hey, guys, uh, don't forget about Homer Simpson.  It has four fingers.  Yeah, that's a little left up.  Yes, Homer has four fingers.  That's...  That's a little left up right there.  It's odd.  You ever see them count down from five? 
[01:59:30]  They always get stuck when they get down to two.  Thanks, John.  Punch it out, guys.  And that ends that bit.  Right.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Can you isolate that last news tease that went local here?  Thank you.  It's perfect for Bob Kelly.  They're doing a, uh, a news story tonight about sinks and how they're dirty.  Duh.  Of course they're dirty.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Getting ready to play, uh, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show? 
[02:00:00]  I think we covered a lot today.  Yes, we did.  Educational.  We didn't really talk about the, uh, the cruise liner going down.  Yeah, because it doesn't, it doesn't matter anymore.  Unless it's some third world ferry that's holding like 800 people too many that capsizes,  nothing ever happens anymore.  The ship hits an iceberg in Antarctica and everyone lives.  I mean, what the hell is that about?  Do you know what the size of the hole was like? 
[02:00:30]  Uh, female passengers?  No.  The size of a fist.  That's all it was.  The size of a fist.  The hole was.  That was it?  And then it took it down.  Sank.  Couldn't take one of those fat lady passengers and put her ass up against the hole?  That must have been a pretty crucial spot.  That's what I'm thinking.  But I was reading up on it and yeah, it was, the hole was the size of a fist.  That's all.  And then it took the whole, the whole liner down.  And that thing is no one is going to recover any of that crap because usually when this stuff 
[02:01:00]  goes down and makes it fun for everybody, they get to dive and, and, you know, and check  it out for years to come.  But I mean, where this thing went down, no one's diving in those waters.  And this will probably a lot of valuable things on that ship.  I'm going to get some nut with a dry suit.  You think that's right?  It'll go down there.  Yeah.  I wonder how deep it would be.  You know what's interesting about those cruise ships though is, you know what the, the,  the big thing they're dealing with right now is, is pirates off of the coast of South  Africa.  Africa.  Africa, not South Africa. 
[02:01:30]  Africa.  They just come out with Uzis.  Yeah.  And grenade launchers.  Yeah.  And RPGs and start shooting them at the ship.  And the captains all know that this is going on.  So they have like a battle plan.  They go around in circles.  And the, the, the ships can actually take a hit from an RPG.  Really?  Yeah.  They, they had a ship that was recently hit and it just showed a little, you know, a  little mark on the side.  Plus, you know what?  Most of these cruise ships, they, they stay away from these crazy areas. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  You don't have to worry about like, if you're going to the Caribbean.  Right.  And I love how they call them pirates.  Like you get this romantic kind of, ah, kind of thing.  No.  It's a bunch of Somalis.  Yeah.  With machetes ready to hack you to pieces.  Skinny's in the water.  Yeah.  Skinny's in the water.  Skinny's in the water.  It's not Johnny Depp going, argh.  There's no parlaying with these people.  I want to parlay.  Arr.  Nothing, nothing romantic about it.  It's nothing like that.  They're just like, oh, no, my, my. 
[02:02:30]  What?  He's clicking at me.  What does that even mean?  You're valuable, sir.  You're valuables.  Not only do they rob you, they cut parts of your body off so they can have dinner later  on.  All right.  So we.  It's one of those big pots.  Also, some of the stuff.  Carrots.  Yeah.  That was so funny.  They always cooked a guy, but they had carrots and potatoes.  They were starving so bad they had to cook a human, but they had carrots and potatoes.  They had to chop in as you were just there up to your, like, shoulders. 
[02:03:00]  It makes a good broth there, Bob.  What are you doing?  Some other things we didn't really mention yet today.  Boy Scouts suspended from school for saying he knew how to tie a noose.  Yeah, just saying he knew how to tie a noose.  That's bad enough now.  Let's relax.  The schools are just.  Enough about the nooses.  Turning our kids into wimps.  You can't get away with anything.  I love the ones where the kid makes a gun with his finger.  Oh, suspended.  Yeah.  For doing something we've all done as kids.  I used to get needles, attach them to the end of a Q-tip, and then we'd get a straw, and 
[02:03:30]  we'd stand out.  Like a blowgun?  Yeah, in the recess, and we'd get a kid we didn't like, and just, and you don't even  know you hit with it, because it's a needle, so it sticks into you, and you really can't  feel it.  You'd just see the back of his pants.  We'd have, like, nine little blood dots.  You know what was also great was paper clips and rubber bands.  Oh, yeah.  You could bend a paper clip.  A lot of people did this with paper. 
[02:04:00]  You just folded up paper real tight and made it into a V, and then put it in the rubber  band, held it, and let go, and it would smack someone to the back of the neck and really  hurt.  But paper clips, you unwind them, make it into a V, and fire one of those.  It's going into somebody.  It is going in them.  Nice welt.  Also, does anyone know why Hulk Hogan is getting a divorce?  That was big news over the weekend.  Because he's a douche?  Oh, he is.  Perhaps.  Iraq, do you know why?  No. 
[02:04:30]  Was he called with the blue meanie or something?  No, she actually hooked up with the trainer.  Didn't she hook up with her trainer?  What?  She's leaving him.  I think she doesn't like him anymore.  She hooked up with somebody.  You know anything, Sam?  If you don't know, screw it.  Just keep growing your afro.  We'll talk to you, sir.  All right.  We don't know yet.  Yeah, Hulkster.  Nincompoop voted Britain's favorite word.  Britain's kind of silly.  Nincompoop? 
[02:05:00]  Nincompoop is their favorite word.  Can they laugh at that?  Oh, you're nincompoop, then.  That's so funny.  Crotch shot.  That is quite nincompoop.  That can't possibly be a favorite word anywhere.  Second favorite word?  Scallywag?  The queen is a douche.  That's not a word.  It's a sentence.  Ah.  Yeah, I know, I know.  Queen douche? 
[02:05:30]  Queen douche.  Queen douche.  No, it's love.  Love is the second favorite word in Britain.  Nincompoop is the number one.  And now we're going to play a game where you get to have fun at home, and that's how this  works.  There's a sex offender out there.  His name is something I can't say on the radio, but I can spell it.  Oh.  First name, P.  Play along at home.  P-H-E-U-K.  Okay.  Last name.  This is a sex offender.  Right. 
[02:06:00]  K-U-E.  All right.  Seems to be probably Vietnamese, I would think.  That's his name.  Southeast Asian.  A sex offender, that's his name.  I just spelled it out for you.  Have fun with that one at home, and laugh at yourself and giggle when you figure it out.  Interesting.  Oh, look at that.  A lot of people coming up with the American spelling of that name.  I didn't know there was an Americanized version of that name.  And sometimes, when they came over to Ellis Island, Opie, they would change the spelling 
[02:06:30]  of it.  And people are doing that right now on Pal Talk.  And it is true that I was offered a job at Abercrombie & Fitch this weekend.  At Abercrombie & Fitch?  Yeah.  What job?  I don't know.  They said, look, it's Christmas season.  Oh, they need people to fold shirts and say, may I help you?  I guess.  Oh, God.  They actually came up to me and Lindsay.  I think they were being polite by offering me a job as well.  I do believe they had their eyes on her.  On the real prime. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, did they ask both of you?  Yeah.  But I think they were being polite.  You'd have been fired after day one.  Right.  Yeah.  And she would make management.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what they were looking at right there.  I guess she fits the profile to work there.  I'm not stupid enough to think I fit the profile to work at Abercrombie & Fitch.  Why don't you take the gig?  Now that I'm in my late 20s, I'm going to only hire high school kids.  Yeah, you can get a job.  College kids.  You can work at Marshalls or TJ Maxx.  Thanks.  Getting ready for what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show? 
[02:07:30]  Oh, so we did free ringtone Monday mania.  Yes.  We did a little of that.  Mm-hmm.  I think my crotch shot thing might become a ringtone.  It could be a ringtone.  Pot talk Monday, we did that when we were just calling each other's phones.  Yeah, it was a little pot talk there.  That's a bit pot talk-y.  You only do that stoned.  And we also do Feel Good Story Monday, just to make everyone feel good about themselves.  Did we do that?  No, but I got one.  All right.  So we can get this out of the way.  It's Feel Good Story Monday.  We should have a Feel Good Story song or an intro.  Yeah? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  All right, we could work on that.  We could get on that.  Something that just feels good.  Up.  I hope he goes, yeah.  Yeah.  Uplifting.  No, we could do that.  Here's your Feel Good Story for this fine Monday.  Tonight, NBC2 exposes an extreme case of abuse.  This paralyzed woman punched in the face.  I don't think my mom's suffering at all.  My mom's my everything.  NBC2 talks to the abused woman and her family.  And wait till you hear why this wheelchair-bound woman was smacked. 
[02:08:30]  There you go.  All right.  See, Feel Good Story is kind of taking a turn into a new direction, I'm noticing.  No.  This is a Feel Good Story.  Like I said, it makes you feel good about yourself.  Oh, that you're not wheelchair-bound getting smacked in the face.  See, my logic in the whole Feel Good Story thing is that there's always someone out there  that is worse than you.  Worse off, yeah.  And it makes you feel better about your situation.  Now it makes perfect sense.  Are you dizzy from spinning?  Now I feel better. 
[02:09:00]  Although this 16-year-old can wipe away her tears, she can't wipe out the image of her  parents fighting Sunday night.  He got on top of her and then he punched her in the face.  Yes, Yasmeen then called 911.  She says she and her three younger sisters witnessed the attack in the front bedroom.  Collier County Sheriff deputies say a drunk Sanchez punched his wife because he didn't  want what she took for dinner.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Is that a different one?  Is that one I haven't heard of yet?  You gotta give me a warning, man. 
[02:09:30]  You almost missed the punchline of the story.  What were you saying, the drunk Sanchez?  Yeah, I was just wondering if he needed a shower or if he was clean or well.  Well, we can invent one called the drunk Sanchez, because listen to why he punched her.  Collier County Sheriff deputies say a drunk Sanchez punched his wife because he didn't  want what she cooked for dinner, vegetable soup.  He didn't like it, whatever, that day.  Point.  And that's what got him even more mad. 
[02:10:00]  Man shouldn't have to come home to vegetable soup.  He punched.  Belting his paralyzed wife.  He punched his paralyzed wife because she made soup for him.  She made soupy.  Oh, vegetable soup does stink.  Really is bad.  I really, I'm not a fan of vegetable soup.  Especially if it's cheapo condensed where you add the water.  But you know how funny it is that he jumped on top of her?  She's just there.  She can't move or push him off.  She makes vegetable soup because that's pretty much all she can probably make because she's  paralyzed. 
[02:10:30]  She's trying to do the right thing.  The final insult was when he said, I don't want any you soup.  But the sad thing is, Eustalia couldn't do anything to protect herself.  She's paralyzed from the waist down.  The result of a car accident in 1993.  Eustalia says after surviving 18 years of marriage to Sanchez, nothing really scares  her anymore.  She said there has been occasions where, you know, she does fear whatever, but then he 
[02:11:00]  just kicks her out of the house or something and it's really nothing.  Yaksmeen says she's grown up watching her dad drink his life away.  Now she wants him out of her mom's life for good.  Life.  Life.  Life.  Life.  Get out of my house.  She enticed me my entire life.  Rolls a wheelchair into the door.  I love that scene.  We got the, she enticed me.  So bad.  She enticed me my entire life. 
[02:11:30]  Here it is.  This is our favorite.  She did.  This is our favorite guy ever.  She enticed me and she would ridicule me.  This is the guy.  We don't have time.  We ran out of show, unfortunately.  This is the guy.  He killed his wife, right?  And then he calls 911 to tell him that there's a dead body in the house.  And the 911 operator's like, well, is she dead?  And he goes, hold on.  I'll check.  And you hear him leave the phone, but you can still hear him in the background.  And he goes, hey, hey, are you alive? 
[02:12:00]  He goes, you dead yet?  Or are you alive?  And then he comes back to the phone and goes, nope, she's dead.  She enticed me.  She enticed me.  You could just hear it in his voice.  She enticed me.  And he was as calm as could be.  Like, all right, well, here's my address.  Come get me.  Oh, he was happy.  He knew he was going to jail.  He didn't care.  He probably, like, sat down, ate some biscuits, called 911. 
[02:12:30]  Well, there's your feel-good story for today.  Unfortunately, we ran out of show, but this would have been perfect for Bob Kelly today  because Bob Kelly likes to do things with sinks when he's on the road or used to.  He used to.  Sure.  He can't find a good sink anymore.  And this came in during the break.  Then, on Fox 5 News at 10.  Ah, four-star hotel.  I'm so excited.  Aren't you, honey?  Oh, yeah.  But wait, don't sit on the bedspread.  What?  It's probably not that clean.  Oh, and wipe off that remote.  Germs.  Well, at least I can have a drink of water.  No, don't.  Know the glasses by your hotel room sink? 
[02:13:00]  Not as clean as you think.  What our undercover cameras caught on tape tonight on Fox 5 News at 10.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy, I don't want to know.  Oh, I thought it was the sink.  It's the glasses?  It seems like it's everything, but the glasses.  It says, oh, boy, what's wrong with the glasses?  Now I need to know.  Can we find the answer for tomorrow?  It doesn't matter.  I drink nothing but booze out of them anyway.  Danny, you already know what's wrong with the glasses?  Oh.  Yeah, well, they teased it this morning, and during the tease, they had, like, security 
[02:13:30]  footage of the maid coming in, taking the used glass, just basically rinsing it under  the sink for, like, I don't know, four seconds, and then just putting it upside down on the  sink.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  You're getting all sorts of...  Oh, boy.  You're getting bad breath remnants.  You never do see that cart with, like, old glasses on it.  No, they never take them out of the room.  It's just towels.  Yeah, they don't take them out of the room.  You never see them clinking around glasses.  Wow, that's a good point.  Wow.  Do you know that remote, how many hands have touched that? 
[02:14:00]  After, like, nasty sex, too.  You just know, like, people aren't...  Let me wash my hands before I touch the remote.  Someone took a blacklight to a hotel room.  They did a whole thing on it, and there was, you know what, like, remnants of that everywhere.  The remote, though, is so many nooks and crannies, it's uncleanable.  Everywhere.  They dip that thing in acetone.  The bedspread, they don't wash.  They just don't wash that.  Well, you're not supposed to lay on that bedspread. 
[02:14:30]  So that thing has seen a lot of naked bodies.  The only solution is to just make your own mess.  Just contribute to it.  Contribute to the...  Just add to the...  Just add to the disaster.  Yes, the DNA pool.  We gotta go over.  By the way, is Danny working on new news teases?  That's one of my favorite parts.  Hope so.  Love those.  One of my favorite bits of the show.  Love it.  All right, guys.  Bobby, thanks.  It was great. 
[02:15:00]  Bob, RobertKelleyLive.com.  RobertKelleyLive.com and Robert Kelly Live on MySpace, right?  Yep, yep.  And Bob, I'm coming back to Boston January 28th to the 1st of February at the Comedy Connection.  So all the Boston people come out to that show.  Bill's place.  Bill Bloomingright.  I call him Bill Bloomingright.  I never heard.  Christ, Christ.  Bobby, thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  All right, guys.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  The virus is spreading. 
[02:15:30]  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  The virus.  Yeah, fuck ecstasy of gold today.  That I saw Good, the Bad, and the Ugly last night, so I don't need to hear that.  No, we'll acknowledge a long time in between shows today.  I don't know what the fuck that was about.  I think because we usually have things to do over there, but we pretty much just were  able to bolt. 
[02:16:00]  All right, so we go right to the rage and get the XM show started with Bobby Kelly in-house  today.  Bobby Kelly.  We got lots to do over here on XM satellite radio.  Might have to get E-Rock in here.  I got a stalker.  What?  I got a radio stalker who works in the business.  In a business.  And we also have the radio show that replaced us in West Palm Beach, Florida. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, really?  And it just shows you why radio sucks.  Yeah.  You know, we were taking it off the air in West Palm Beach, Florida.  We had pretty good ratings.  I mean, we weren't setting the world on fire, but we were doing very well, and we were doing  okay in our demo.  That should be enough to just be able to keep your job.  But in this day and age, that's not good enough.  So then when you find out you're losing a market, you're absolutely bummed and stuff.  And then they get a replacement. 
[02:17:00]  And of course, out of curiosity, you're like, all right, who's replacing you in this market?  You gotta know.  And it's this show, Loper and Smitty, and they suck dick.  And this is what's gonna, like, I'm not gonna sleep at night because of this.  I would understand if it was like a polished show that's local, and I get it to a point.  But when you get audio of the show that's replacing you, and it's this, holy crap, I want  to strangle somebody.  Pretty bad stuff. 
[02:17:30]  I want to strangle somebody.  Yeah, and you were down there this holiday there, E-Rock?  Yeah, they're doing some big contest giveaway for something involving Papa Roach, which was  the big surprise this morning, along with the new show.  But they were running a promo through the whole holiday weekend, stating that finally  a live, original morning show that doesn't suck.  Oh, thanks.  That's nice.  This business really blows.  So, in other words, we sucked, is what he was saying. 
[02:18:00]  So, they got a show in that won't, that doesn't suck.  Another guy that never said it to our face.  Yeah, I know.  Bunch of fucking faggots in this business.  Just fairy merry fags.  We're on the XM now, apparently, right?  Oh.  Yes, Bobby.  Yes, Bobby.  Now you can start your cursing.  The beginning of the promo was stating, it's like, there was an outcry.  You asked, we responded.  It's a new local show.  They're bringing back music in the morning, local traffic, and entertainment news, and 
[02:18:30]  things like that, because this is what West Palm Beach wanted.  Well, there's a thing going on in radio where everyone is heading back toward local programming,  and I don't know if that's actually going to get the job done.  Well, it won't take long for them to realize, it doesn't matter where the fuck you're from.  It doesn't matter where you're sitting while you're doing the show.  If the show's good, people will listen.  If it's not, people won't.  And this is where I'm a psychopath.  Like, I'm following all the shows that are replacing us.  And, uh, what?  This is where?  Oh.  You're going to pull out a scroll? 
[02:19:00]  Are you stomping on somebody's cake?  Did you show us that?  Throwing poker chips at somebody's face?  Should I go on?  Yeah, yeah.  Going to punch somebody at an appearance?  Going to kill a dog?  The dog thing, I will not take credit for.  All right.  Playing a paralyzed lady getting attacked?  That was funny.  Yeah, there you go.  It was.  Going to give you that.  Like, the show that, um, when we got kicked out of Dallas, they, like, we were splitting the 
[02:19:30]  morning show with, um, the other guys.  I don't know.  I forgot their names, even.  I don't remember.  Whatever.  I've been following their ratings.  Nothing happening whatsoever.  Yeah.  Trust me.  I watched this stuff like a hawk after it happened to us.  Hell yeah.  So there's Loper and Smitty?  Are you going to do surgery?  Smitty.  I'm making sure I don't get sick.  Steve decides he has to come to work today.  And he's telling us all the shit that's wrong with him.  I'm like, stop sucking cock.  And all that shit will go away. 
[02:20:00]  Oh my God.  He's like, yeah, I got things growing on my tongue and the back of my throat.  I'm like, holy shit.  Will you go home?  My immune system is weak.  It's the germaphobe, by the way.  But after what Steve said, I'm going to be scrubbing with this stuff.  I'm not really a germaphobe.  I'm a disgusting-aphobe.  Disgusting-aphobe.  I don't like disgusting things that just so happen that a lot of disgusting stuff have germs in them, so people think I'm a germaphobe.  His tongue is swollen and it's growing shit. 
[02:20:30]  Who wants to look at Steve's tongue?  Bobby, would you do it?  Dr. Kelly?  I'm not even going for a puke.  Do we have masks?  This is where I do tap out.  I don't like getting close to sick people because I get sick pretty easily.  Where's a surgical mask?  Do we have a surgical mask and gloves?  I'll examine Steve.  Would you really?  Rectally.  You wouldn't.  Get close to Steve.  Give me a tongue depressor, gloves, and a mask, and I will examine Steve.  Steve, what is going on in your throat and tongue?  What do you have?  Don't use any of these mics because we use these. 
[02:21:00]  Yes, stay back.  Wear a SARS mask.  Hold on.  As we get said, let's go to Colin.  I need a mask, though.  In West Palm Beach, Florida.  Colin.  Yo, fellas, what's happening?  Hey, buddy.  Let me tell you about Smitty and Roper, the biggest bunch of douches I've ever listened to.  It lasted for 45 seconds, and I said, thank God for XM Radio.  Well, the weird part is it's like, all right, you're going to replace us, so then you expect  something where you go, okay, I get it.  I get it.  They're local. 
[02:21:30]  They're polished.  They have a name in the market, whatever.  But when you're replaced by a shitty show, it's really frustrating.  We'll get into their audio in a few minutes, but first, Anthony's got the gloves.  I don't have a mask, though.  I don't want him breathing on me, so I need a surgical mask.  Make one.  All right.  Then just have...  You want to tie something around my head?  Bob, Bobby, just look at his tongue.  Seriously.  Well, give me...  What the hell?  I don't want to catch that disease.  Let me have a...  Give me a paper towel.  Just wrap it around my face.  A paper towel?  Yeah, just wrap it around my head.  All right. 
[02:22:00]  Ant's got the gloves on.  The Sudan?  Ant's got the gloves on.  Can we have something...  By the way, take the windscreen off before you talk into that.  There we go.  Now I'm ready.  All right.  Okay.  Steve, come on over here.  Okay, Steve.  Stay away from my smoothie.  Hold on.  You fucking AIDS-ridden cocksucker.  You can hear the fatness in your throat.  Yeah.  Meaning like it's all swollen and crap.  My throat is swollen with something.  I don't know.  Okay.  Yeah, thank you.  Everybody.  Come here, Steve.  That's the default answer.  Let's see. 
[02:22:30]  This cord isn't going to reach them.  It's AIDS juice.  All right.  Use that mic.  All right.  Use that mic.  I don't give a shit.  And then you can lie solid.  Come here.  Open your mouth.  I won't touch anything, but open your mouth.  You look like a creep.  Let me see.  Hit a flashlight.  Oh, yes.  I need a flashlight.  Steve, what are you saying?  There's stuff growing on your tongue?  It's all swollen.  It's very...  Ah.  Ew.  Wait a minute.  Keep doing that.  There's...  Yes, the back of his throat looks all like closed up.  Put your tongue down.  Does the back of his throat look dented?  Yeah.  It's dented. 
[02:23:00]  It looks like an impression of the head of a cop.  You do absolutely have something going on.  Do you have white dots?  Look at me.  Show Dr. Kelly.  Look at me.  Look at me.  He's got like potholes in the back of his throat.  Jesus Christ.  What?  Put your head back a little.  Come here.  Come here closer.  What the fuck do you want me to do?  Just get closer, homo.  Now, open your mouth like you're going to put a nice black cock in it.  Stop doing that.  Go...  All right, bend down.  Your fucking fat tongue is in the way. 
[02:23:30]  I know.  What the fuck do you want me to do with it?  Dude, you've got a huge tongue, man.  Put your tongue down.  Go...  No, not your head.  Who knew that Steve had such a fucking huge tongue?  I know.  He's got like a dog tongue.  He's panting.  Say it again.  Say it again.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  I'm fucking drooling.  It's all right.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Go...  Keep going.  Stop laughing.  What the fuck?  Oh, you're fucking weird. 
[02:24:00]  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Just keep going.  Stop talking, you asshole.  Bobby, got a fever?  Oh, my God.  Your makeshift mask is not covering your face anymore.  Do you have a fever?  I'm sure I do.  You're sweating.  Yeah.  That's because I just had my...  That's great.  He just opened it.  I'm sure I do.  My sicknesses with fevers are the worst.  Yeah.  And this has been lingering for a couple of weeks now.  Linger.  Linger.  It has.  And I cannot figure out what is going on.  I take 33 vitamins a day.  I've got airborne echinacea.  All kinds of things. 
[02:24:30]  Losing weight.  Losing weight.  It went away.  Try it.  Losing weight.  Sarcoma?  Yes, exactly.  Let's go to a disease specialist.  Broth.  Carl in Jersey.  Carl.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm a pulmonary infectious disease specialist.  Listen, if he's got the white bumps on the back of his throat, then that's bacteria.  You guys are all breathing it in.  It's too late.  Great.  If you're sitting across the room from a conference table from him, you're already exposed.  Oh, stop it.  Why don't you get the fuck out, Steve?  That's what I was looking for.  It was white bumps, and he had no white bumps.  What does he got, Ann? 
[02:25:00]  What did you see in there?  I saw streptococcus.  Ooh.  Lingalonga.  I don't know what it is.  Without the streptococcus.  I just saw some caucas in there.  A bit of caucas.  Some caucas.  I saw gay.  Suck the caucas.  Steve, get out of here.  I don't want to get sick.  By the way, I was sitting on the couch getting ready for the show, and I saw a commercial  for maybe the women could call up today.  Vaginal screening kit.  Vaginal screening kit?  Well, what is that?  Well, you know the girls could, you know, see if they're pregnant and stuff, but this 
[02:25:30]  is to see if you've got any fucking diseases, and there's like, and somehow you take the  strip after you use it, and then it's color-coded with each disease that you can have, and  so you take the strip.  How many pussy diseases are there?  I don't know, but you take the strip, and you go along the box, and you go, oh, brown  shit.  Along the box?  Jesus.  Wait a minute.  So the strip looks like Froot Loops?  And depending on what color pops up, is what's wrong with your snatch?  That's what I saw on TV. 
[02:26:00]  It's called the vaginal screening kit.  Maybe we can get some more info on it.  There's nothing like that for the cock, huh?  All you got is like, if you see something on your cock, go to the doctor.  Yeah.  But women got all these vag things.  Oh, yeah, because it's like an open sore.  It's just a big open sore.  It really, look at the vagina, dude.  It sounds so great.  It really is nasty.  You make it, uh, I'm sorry, I was...  Above that.  No, how could you make, how could you want me to look at a web page that has the vaginal 
[02:26:30]  screening kit and not look at Jessica Alba?  Jessica Alba's on Regis, I guess.  Wow, you have lovely tits!  Love them!  So what do you mean a pussy looks like an open sore?  Dude, you open up a pussy and it's just like, it looks like you're doing heart surgery.  Yeast infection or something more?  Test you can, uh, no.  Easy to use, fast results, clinically tested.  Uh, let's see.  It's not a screening kit for diseases like HIV, chlamydia, herpes, uh, gonorrhea, syphilis, 
[02:27:00]  group B streptococcus, and it's not meant to be used by pregnant women.  So what does it do?  What does it test for?  You can test your pool, too, to see if the chlorine levels are high.  If your pH is off, it's gonna make your eyes burn?  It, uh...  It does, it tells you whether your pH is normal.  Yeah.  A woman's pH has to be normal in there?  Dude, it is like a pool.  It's like a...  That's amazing. 
[02:27:30]  What, their pussy's like a fish tank?  It's like a fish tank.  You gotta put a heater in there and a pump?  I always shake it.  So it blows bubbles out?  That's the same result.  A little diver?  Has the same results as a fish tank?  It's a treasure chest that opens and closes.  Same result if you don't wash it.  Same result as a fish tank.  If it's not alright, you'll get that dead fish smell.  Your pussy will get ick.  I know what ick is.  Fin ick.  Fin ick.  I used to, like, raise little guppies and they would get the ick and crush my little heart.  Aw.  You have to throw them down and curl it. 
[02:28:00]  And hundreds of guppies are dead from the ick.  The fish aids.  It is the fish aids.  Well, you know what I used to do with girls?  I used to have the deodorant on my armpit and I'd put my finger under my armpit and then  I'd finger fuck them.  But if they went, ah, you know there's something wrong with that pussy.  Let's, let's, you know what?  My God.  Hold on.  We got to check.  We got Misty from Utah.  Misty.  Hey.  Hi, Misty.  How are you?  Sure it isn't musty.  That's a little joke about what you're calling about.  Misty, what's up? 
[02:28:30]  I was just calling about the magic kit you guys were talking about.  Yeah.  Yes.  It is, I guess, to test whether or not you have a yeast infection.  Yeah, but there were different colors.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  You do have to have a certain pH and if your pH is off, then you either have too much yeast  or too much bacteria.  Now, what if it's too acidic?  Do you stick a Tums in your pussy?  Well, you can have either a yeast infection or a bacterial infection. 
[02:29:00]  But that pH will tell that?  Like, which one is more acidic and which one is more alkaline?  Because if you get like an alkaline pussy.  You could run a little car.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  I honestly don't know.  But one, you would have to have like a, well, not Vagisil, but...  Yeah, whatever they use for the yeast.  You can take some green water.  Well, some girls get that.  You have to take an antibiotic.  What did you have? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, what did you have that you had to get this kit?  I don't, but I've seen the commercial for it and I used to work in a doctor's office, so...  Is it usually women that spend a lot of time just like sitting down and with tight clothes  on or something?  Like, what is it?  I don't know.  It's really, I guess, it's kind of a delicate balance in there.  I don't know.  Something's telling me, though, if you know, you're wearing like, it's something that's  airing it out a little bit.  You don't have to worry about it.  You got to keep it.  Like, not as much bacteria going crazy in there. 
[02:30:00]  Basically, Misty doesn't know shit.  Well, it's hard to see.  It's hard to see.  Thank you, Misty.  A pussy, if you open up a pussy, it's like, I don't know what that bump is or that nugget  or that little flap.  Oh, that's red.  You're hysterical.  This is pink.  That's fucking brown.  I don't, you open up a fucking pussy, it's like, holy shit, there's just little nuggets.  Dude, you got to use the clam logic.  What's the clam logic?  You look at a clam, you know if it's good or bad by just looking at it. 
[02:30:30]  What do you mean?  If it opens up in the heat, if you light a pussy on fire and it stays shut, it's a bad  clam?  You ever get a clam and like, there's some of the clam meat just hanging over the sides  and it's like, it's a color that's not normal?  You just know.  Yeah, but what color is normal?  I mean.  You just know, Bobby.  Bobby.  There are many different types.  You've never had clams on the half shell?  Well, you just know when you're eating a good clam.  And each has their own separate little look. 
[02:31:00]  So what do you, you know, it's not, one isn't any worse or better than the other health-wise.  I was with this one girl.  I opened up her fucking box and I started sucking on her fucking pussy and she had one  of her pussy lips was like, there was this thing that's like three inches long, but it  was like thin.  It was like a flap.  What the fuck are you?  What?  A flap. 
[02:31:30]  It was like a piece of spaghetti.  You went down on a piss clam.  A flap.  It was like a piece of spaghetti.  Well, that can mean it's a good clam.  You just gotta, you just gotta push that part back up onto the shelf before you eat it.  What do you mean?  You fold it.  Oh, that's, that isn't even right.  You fold it over.  And then, if you haven't reached inside a pussy, you go inside and then there's that bump in  the middle and it has all kinds of little bumps on it. 
[02:32:00]  And then there's all kinds of like little nuggets inside.  You just.  Nuggets.  There's a lot of, there's a lot of areas to hide in there.  Yeah, it's like, fuck, man.  What does this corner do?  This, um.  What is that?  What is that little bump?  What gnome is hiding in this corner?  You could be rubbing like an eyeball in there and you don't even know it.  It's like winking.  There's a lot of wackiness going on in there.  And I don't know where the G spot is.  I, you know, I've been trying to find this G spot.  Like they say, it's like a clitoris. 
[02:32:30]  Bobby.  Yeah.  Just do this.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm here.  And then.  Yeah, but I can't.  And then a come here.  Yeah.  But how long do I have to fucking do the come here?  You'll know.  Well, how?  Like, I mean.  Right.  And it's not a fucking on off switch.  You're not going to be able to touch that and have it go crazy.  You're going to have to still continue doing other shit.  It's one.  It's one.  Huh.  Huh.  And then come here.  How huh?  Because our gynecologist is fucking doing the same thing. 
[02:33:00]  You know, you're putting fingers in there and checking shit out.  You got to keep things going.  You got to dig in.  Get your fucking face wet.  Be a man.  I don't mind getting in there.  But it's like.  Is this Regis and Kathy Lee, Regis and Kelly live?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Because that guy walking out would have been hysterical if he just would have sniffed the  chair that Jessica Alba was just sitting in.  What do you think like they would do?  They would.  Would they lose their minds? 
[02:33:30]  Of course.  Just go.  He's smelling a chair.  No one's got balls.  That'd be so funny.  He wants to know what Jessica Alba smells like.  Like if you're following Jessica Alba out on that chair that they sit on, you got to  sniff it.  I did that with Kim Basinger.  Where?  At a restaurant next to the Comedy Cellar.  Right.  She came in with Alec.  Yeah.  And Alec.  And there was like.  In the restaurant there was only one bathroom.  It's like not a guy or a girl.  It's just one.  You know.  Unisex.  And she went to the bathroom.  I ran in right after. 
[02:34:00]  Didn't smell anything though.  You smelt the seat?  Oh yeah.  On the toilet.  Oh God Jesus.  But it's a fucking unisex bathroom.  So this.  I just had guy balls.  Oh of course.  Let's say hi to Tom.  I'm in Tennessee.  Tom.  Good morning boys.  What's going on?  Hey Tom.  Hey Bobby.  You're a fucking idiot.  You said that you can't find the G spot.  But you just described the fucking G spot.  You idiot.  With a whole bunch of little bumps on it.  You stupid ass.  Oh I'm sorry. 
[02:34:30]  You fucking master of the pussy.  You damn right I am.  Stick to men.  There's nothing wrong with admitting you're the master of the pussy there.  He just gave me good advice.  What did he say?  He said stick to men.  Thank you buddy.  Well dude.  I really.  I'm sorry.  I was just asking a question.  I guess that's the G spot.  Is that bump.  That lump with bumps.  Is that what you're saying?  The lump with bumps.  Whereabouts are you like thinking?  Jam in.  Okay.  And then there's like a bump. 
[02:35:00]  So you're thinking finger deep.  Kind of.  Deep in.  And then.  Against the wall of the front.  The abdomen.  I always forget to cut my fingernails too.  The girls love that.  Yeah.  Nice long sharp fucking fingernails.  That's good.  Freddy Krueger's sticking him.  That's great Bobby.  Come on.  There's stuff under your fingernails.  Moving back to the West Palm Beach situation.  Oh.  Speaking of cunts.  So this is the show that replaced us.  And we have no problem giving you a little taste.  Yeah.  Let's see.  This is what West Palm Beach thinks is better than what we were doing for them. 
[02:35:30]  Right?  Is that what it comes down to?  Ron.  They play a lot of music and a lot of local traffic.  And what else?  Sports and entertainment news.  They wanted a lot of that because apparently that's what the audience wanted in West Palm Beach.  Yeah.  They were clamoring for it.  And we answered.  Shut up.  Little background on these two guys.  One of them was fired from that station allegedly.  For a...  Well, he was fired. 
[02:36:00]  That's what we were told, but it wasn't really on record.  So I'm going to say allegedly for allegedly being involved in some...  Alleged allegedness?  Substances.  Allegedly.  Yeah.  So he was let go a couple years ago.  And the other guy was an intern for the morning show that originally was there before they fired him.  An intern?  An intern.  We were replaced by an old intern?  By the afternoon jock and an intern. 
[02:36:30]  Oh my God.  Well, good luck to you.  All right.  Sam, you know something about these guys?  Keeping my eye on these guys.  Yeah.  Smitty is the intern.  And before he was Smitty, he was Whisker Biscuit.  Whisker Biscuit.  Yeah.  We got replaced by Whisker Biscuit.  Whisker Biscuit.  Oh, God.  Just...  Thank God I have enough money in the bank.  I'm so done with this.  Business.  Business, man.  We got replaced by Whisker Biscuit.  Whisker Biscuit.  And Jeremy keeps coming up with nicknames that play off his last name, which is Loper. 
[02:37:00]  Right.  So he would call himself the Lopeness Monster.  He would drink Lope Wisers while on the show.  Oh, fuck.  He'd go, yo...  I swear, I just got like a shiver.  He'd go, yo, yo, it's J-Lo on your radio, yo.  Not kidding.  That doesn't rhyme with Loper.  He was into the whole J-Lo thing back in like 2002.  That's Jeremy Loper.  Yeah.  He's the male J-Lo.  Oh.  Holy shit.  This is what the business is all about. 
[02:37:30]  And corporate doesn't understand why I'm fucking losing my mind.  Wow.  Whatever, dudes.  Anyway, here's their sweeper.  Jeremy Loper and Smitty here in the morning.  Oh, okay.  Enough said right there.  Wait, wait.  Jeremy Loper.  God.  What's that fucking voice?  It's the puke voice.  The G-Spot is not the back of the clit, you fucking idiot.  Shut up, you dummy.  You guys are idiots.  The G-Spot is the back of the clit. 
[02:38:00]  It's inside the body.  The clit is what Bobby's talking about with the bumps.  Holy shit.  No, I'm talking about inside.  I know what the clit is.  All right.  Look, I've hacked enough women up in my day to know I'm inside and out.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the sweeper I meant to play.  None of that syndicated bull shit.  This is for locals only.  The Morning Bond.  See?  Thanks.  This is the trend in the business to get rid of syndicated shows and go local.  Well, isn't it cheaper for them just to go this route, the station? 
[02:38:30]  Well, it's just a trend that's happening, and we're going to lose because of it.  Like, it's all about getting local morning shows back.  We're the new ends of, like, the business.  Huh?  Syndicated shows are the new ends of the business.  Right.  That's what we are.  We're ends.  We're losing to a trend right now.  It's all about getting your local morning show in place.  I'm going to get you this.  Yep.  I'm going to get you this secret.  So, and here we go.  Here we go.  Here's Loper talking about his awesome kids. 
[02:39:00]  Smitty changes the subject.  This is what replaced us in West Palm Beach, Florida.  We have no problem showing you guys this.  Hold on.  If you think this is better than us, then God bless you.  Jeremy Loper and Smitty here in the morning, the new morning buzz.  We're kind of...  Jeremy Loper and Smitty here in the morning, the new morning buzz.  We're kind of giving you a little brief summary on what we've been doing the last... 
[02:39:30]  Well, me, the last five years.  You've been gone for the radio station close to three years now.  I'm married.  I have two awesome kids.  My wife, Patty...  Holy shit!  I'm going to fucking...  Give me a fucking break with your awesome kids!  Oh my god!  I can't sit here.  I'm going to lose my fucking mind.  Holy shit!  That sucked!  You know what?  I got to...  20 seconds, not even.  I got to stop...  I got to stop taking this shit seriously, because it will drive me nuts.  This is what fucking replaced us? 
[02:40:00]  Yes, E-Rock?  Wait till you hear the other guy.  Okay.  Wait, this guy's the better of the two?  See if you can tell who's who.  Oh, okay.  Holy shit!  A little brief summary on what we've been doing the last...  Well, me, the last five years.  You've been gone for the radio station close to three years now.  I'm married.  I have two awesome kids.  My wife, Patty, and...  Oh my god.  His wife, Patty, and his awesome kids.  Hopefully he finishes the sentence with, sucks black cocks. 
[02:40:30]  Something of interest.  Dude, you know what?  I mean, we do talk about kids here and there and stuff, but...  Oof.  This West Palm Beach, Florida, they're an alternative rock station.  You talk about dating them.  They're talking to very young, like, guys.  They tell you guys, they don't want to hear about your awesome kids.  Nope.  That's a fucking young male demo-driven station, and then you get guys on there that are talking  about fucking my wife, Patty, and my awesome kids. 
[02:41:00]  You know what your kids are?  They're probably...  I'm not even going to rag you.  They're probably just like everyone else's kids.  Not awesome.  They're average fucking kids.  They take shits.  They have snot coming out their nose, and they're not fucking geniuses.  They're just kids.  And I have a four-year-old son, Jaden, a little daughter, Kaylee.  She's two and a half, so exciting times at the Loper household.  It was quite the trip down here, dude. 
[02:41:30]  I know that you know my kids very well, and there is nothing like traveling 1,200 miles  with a two-year-old and a four-year-old.  Oh, my God.  The drive was insane.  I don't have kids.  I am a kid myself.  See the other guy?  I'm so glad that we're good at the buzz.  Okay.  What?  That's Smitty.  Is there something wrong with the processing that makes them sound ardemical?  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  That's Brian.  Dude, you know what?  Wow.  Okay.  You know something? 
[02:42:00]  This show could work.  I would listen to these guys.  Why would you listen to these guys?  Because I want to hit them.  Dude, this is awful.  This is what replaced us, though.  I know.  This.  That's great stuff.  This is going to get it done.  This.  Hey, it's local.  Come on.  My daughter.  Awesome children.  1,200 miles with a two-year-old and a four-year-old. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, my God.  The drive was insane.  I don't have kids.  I'm a kid myself.  I'm so glad that I'm working at the buzz and not some radio station in, like, South Carolina.  Did you notice how bad the radio was in South Carolina?  I don't like country music or...  And Bible verses.  Jesus FM.  Holy shit, man.  Dude, I might have an aneurysm.  I...  Yeah.  You have no idea.  I hope he's losing his mind right now.  You have no fucking idea that we...  We have to sit here and deal with being replaced by this shit? 
[02:43:00]  Nice fucking...  Nice chemistry they have as far as conversation goes.  One's talking about one thing.  The other one just goes off in another fucking direction.  It's like, ah, dude, and awesome.  That, like...  Yeah, awesome.  Oh, what a trip.  It was insane.  Crazy, dude.  It was...  It was crazy.  My four-year-old puked somewhere in Georgia?  They left afternoons in Albany.  Not Tom Brady.  What?  They left afternoons in Albany to go to West Palm.  Oh, Albany?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  Well...  Goddamn.  Maybe we're just out of touch because they're ready to...  They're ready.  Are you ready for this?  Yeah.  They're getting...  I don't think I am, but...  They're getting ready to crack a lopeweiser.  Okay.  Just...  Could someone crack a bat over my head?  They're not cracking a lopeweiser.  Yes, Iroch?  He's insane.  He's going nuts.  I don't know how they do it for the morning show now, but he used to crack lopeweisers before  he used to go into road rage, which was like Metallica and Disturbed and Korn. 
[02:44:00]  Of course.  Well, once they got to mornings, they realized that lopeweiser is so strong, you don't even  need a specific reason to crack a lopeweiser.  Anytime is a good time to crack a lopeweiser.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, and the company thinks I'm insane.  Or you're...  The company's insane if they think this is what needs to be done in a radio market.  This is local programming.  Well, let's listen to a cracking of a lopeweiser.  Whatever you guys want, we're here for you. 
[02:44:30]  It's live local radio, the morning buzz back in effect.  Very, very exciting.  Shall we crack a lopeweiser?  I believe we just probably should.  And coming up here, we'll get you your morning buzz headlines along with buzz workforce traffic  and we'll check your weather.  Also, we will get some morning buzz sports smack.  It's all on the way.  The new morning buzz with Loper and Smitty.  All right.  Our goal is to completely destroy everybody.  Wait, what the fuck was that?  And that means to destroy radio as an industry.  Did they even...  We are going to fuck it up so bad next time...  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  ...that they have to officially, like, shut off the power of every radio station in America.  That is my new goal.  Holy mother of Christ.  There was no context to take that.  Why did they crack a lopeweiser to play the fucking stupid beer sound effect that they've  been doing since the 70s?  Why did we have to...  Since the fucking 70s, Jocks have been using that...  That beer sound effect to be cool.  And this is why we get absolutely no respect, because we are lumped in with these guys.  These shows. 
[02:45:30]  Like the guy in Cleveland that has to say, and punt.  After every...  A lopeweiser.  The guy will say something outrageous and then go, and punt.  Can someone please tell Budweiser so they can give him a cease and desist to not fucking  do that anymore?  I like this.  You guys, this is like the old Opie and Anthony.  You guys are going to...  Shut the fuck up.  You're going to dominate the world.  Oh, no.  He means we are.  Fuck yeah, I'm pissed.  No.  I want to...  Let's start cracking open some opeweisers. 
[02:46:00]  Opeweiser.  What's Anthony?  Opeweiser's easy.  We need a drink for Anthony.  Anheuser.  Just call it a doucheweiser.  Coo me a cocktail.  No, anheuser is a good one.  Anheuser.  Anheuser bush.  Yeah.  I just want an anheuser bush.  Where's the stupid sound effect?  Oh, I need that.  Crack one open.  Can you get...  Goddamn rich cunt.  Can you fucking record these guys every day for this week? 
[02:46:30]  We are playing lopeweiser audio all fucking week.  All right.  Do you have more there or is that it?  We got more.  Oh, please.  Let's say hi to...  Is it Ramone?  It's Ramone.  Ramone, get me a lopeweiser.  That take can't be real.  You guys got to be putting this on.  You guys got replaced by those shit dicks.  I guess so.  This is why, I swear to God, I'm either going to be in an insane asylum or out of radio soon. 
[02:47:00]  Those are the two choices.  Because I can't take it anymore.  And I talked to corporate.  I'm like, what?  What do you mean they're replacing us in West Palm?  I'm like, all right.  I'll sit back and watch and see what they replace us with.  I'll be open-minded enough as a guy that works for this company.  All right.  Let's see what they replace us with.  And it's this.  Give the stations autonomy to do what they please.  And this is what they do.  That's fine. 
[02:47:30]  It's local programming.  Let's go to Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hey, I see these guys are real rope bags.  I wish they'd go up themselves.  Let's go to Chuck in Jersey.  Chuck.  No, it's John from Jersey.  Hey, whatever.  What's up, John?  Hey, yeah.  How you doing?  I am married and have two awesome kids.  I can really identify with these guys.  They are fantastic.  They're so good.  How often do you think they have to stress you're listening to live local radio? 
[02:48:00]  Oh, the PD's probably telling them, now, come on.  You've got to do this constantly.  Well, we told you the PD never wanted us, and I guess he had to wait a year and what?  What are we up to?  A year and eight months to finally get rid of us.  And he just was convinced that it's all about being local.  So now they're going to push that issue.  Every morning, I drop my kids off to school.  The last thing I want to hear about is fucking kids, okay?  The last thing.  That is no shit.  That is the reality of life.  You know, when you're making your first impression doing a morning show, I don't think you should mention kids. 
[02:48:30]  Maybe after the audience kind of accepts you a little bit, then maybe you throw a little of that kid shit in.  I have two awesome kids.  No.  But you talk about making a first impression, and you're talking to rock dudes.  We were down there.  These guys like their rock, and you're on the radio talking about your awesome kids your first break.  That is a bad, bad sign.  You know what you need?  You need a show like our show, or like Toucher and Rich, where it's just a drunk. 
[02:49:00]  Right, right.  Just a drunk on there that doesn't care.  That don't.  That don't use, like, fake.  Ah.  Yeah.  Ah, wow.  That was your, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Honey, you put the awesome kids to bed.  How was your first day at the station?  It was awesome.  Just like our awesome kids.  Our kids.  Come on.  Honey, you're awesome.  Group hug around the loper household.  Ugh.  God, you can only hope for an open flu on the water heater, and none of them waking in the 
[02:49:30]  morning.  You can only hope for a lope crash.  Oh, fucking.  A flounder in Jersey.  What's up?  What's up, boys?  How's it going today?  How you doing?  Your beer for Anthony would be the Anttell Light.  Anttell Light.  And I'm going to take, I'm taking the Opweiser.  Yeah, the Opweiser Anttell Light show.  All right.  Just pop that Anttell Light.  What about Norton?  Norton needs a beverage.  E-Rock needs a beverage.  Than needs a beverage. 
[02:50:00]  Norton's is urine.  Sam needs a beverage.  What do you got?  What do you got there, Than?  Well, this would be kind of taken from, I wanted to Than Adams.  Than Adams?  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  You got, no, well, Sam Adams is too boring, Sam.  We got to do something else for you.  How about Rolling E-Rock?  Oh, nice.  There you go.  What's that cheap wine that the blacks drank?  We'll give that to Sam.  We'll give that to Sam.  Ripple?  Sam.  Ripple?  Ripple?  Ripple?  More liquor. 
[02:50:30]  Mad Dog 2020?  I'm trying to figure out how to say Cult 45, but with Sam in it.  Yeah, that's hard.  A Sam 45.  I kind of liked it.  They're not trying very hard.  Yeah, why should we try to be clever?  It's low-pwiser.  Sounds nothing like Bud.  And I hope you don't get confused and think you're hearing jealousy from us.  It's more outrage.  Trust me.  Trust me.  Jealousy?  There's no jealousy.  This is outrage that we would be replaced by these schmucks. 
[02:51:00]  Have fun down there.  And believe me, we will announce their ratings every single time they come out.  Absolutely.  And more audio all week, Sam, because the next one, I can play this audio.  Do we have more for even today?  Bring more.  Bring me more, Ramon.  We need more.  Because this next one, it's Loper and Smitty.  They come out of Limp Bizkit, then take a call from a crazy caller.  They can't work the phone.  Oh, cringing.  He kind of adds, it's not Limp Bizkit. 
[02:51:30]  Lope Bizkit?  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, fuck.  He makes it a little more fun, is all.  All right.  Limp Bizkit?  Limp Bizkit.  Why Limp Bizkit?  It's fun.  It's the morning.  It's the morning.  Sam's the biggest dick.  It's fun.  It's the morning.  Get me more audio.  You got more?  Then we can start cutting up immediately.  Where's Danny and everybody?  Start cutting this shit up.  Oh, this is horrible.  We had so much shit we wanted to do. 
[02:52:00]  Watch this.  Holy shit.  Clear the field.  Opie just took every CD that was in front of him that contained everything we were doing  today and wiped it off the console.  It's all about Loper and Smitty.  Opie's back.  Dude, dude, is that Loper's blog?  It's his blog?  Yeah.  The Good Life.  Current mood.  Accomplished.  Yo.  I had the most amazing Halloween ever.  My son and daughter are the age where they enjoy Halloween to the max. 
[02:52:30]  Jaden was Diego and Kaylee was Dora.  Picks to come.  Just to hear them laugh and to see them smile during trick-or-treating was an awesome moment.  We have a lot of good stuff happening lately.  Things are awesome as I see them.  Have a great night, Loper.  You're a fucking douche. 
[02:53:00]  Awesome.  I hope you don't have awesome DNA.  Dude.  This guy.  Oh, this is so.  The whole awesome thing.  This is so.  He's into Jaden and Kaylee.  Oh, this is.  Kids and Halloween.  It's so.  Oh, man.  Fuck off.  Here we go.  Well, let's listen.  Let's listen.  You, your wife, your kids, all just fuck off.  They also apparently have a bit, uh, Bronx Johnny, the Ron and Fess show actually hates these  people, too.  Really?  They come up with their own N-word. 
[02:53:30]  What is it called?  Yeah.  From their blog, uh, Ninjas Unite.  Uh, so we love singing along to hip hop songs, but hate saying the N-word.  This can at times cause a problem.  Who hates saying the N-word?  Favorite hip hop game.  Fuck.  Who the fuck hates saying the N-word?  Who hates saying it?  We know we're not allowed to, but who hates it?  Let's, let's all be honest.  Black, white, purple.  I don't give a shit what color you are.  What color you are?  It's just.  We all love saying the words.  Everyone says it and loves to say it.  I love what black people say it. 
[02:54:00]  It might be, uh.  You say it.  It might be politically incorrect these days, but we can all agree that we love saying it.  If people didn't enjoy saying it, no one would ever say it.  Who the fuck doesn't love saying it?  It's running rampant.  I like the way Patrice says it.  Especially with the windows up and the doors locked.  Patrice says it great.  I like that he says it like, uh, he's surprised.  Nigga.  Yeah.  Nigga please.  Patrice loves the word.  Loves it.  He loves it.  Um.  Oh, yeah.  Well, their hate, their hatred can at times cause a problem as some of our favorite hip 
[02:54:30]  hop jams are chock full of n-bombs.  Get Bronx Johnny in the front.  He said as some of our favorite hip hop jams are chock full of n-bombs.  Yes.  Hey, uh, why does Bronx Johnny hate this show?  I've never heard of Loper or Smitty until today.  I don't know.  It just came up on his radar.  By the way, hold on.  I gotta, I gotta crack open a rolling A-Roc.  Oh, yeah.  That's good. 
[02:55:00]  Got myself a rolling A-Roc.  Can I get one, dude?  I'm a little parched.  Well, no.  You can have a, uh, I'll give you another.  An ant still?  All right.  Give him an ant still.  An ant still?  Oh, thanks.  Wow.  That's good.  Does this match with my sobriety?  Oh, yes, Dan?  Well, they have an example of how they want to replace the N-word with the word ninja.  That's their solution.  Uh-huh.  Um, let's try it.  I ain't saying she's a gold digger, but she ain't messing with no broke ninjas. 
[02:55:30]  Holy mother of God.  All right.  I, I, I can't even.  And now what'll ninjas be called?  Because ninjas are, are fucking ninjas.  Yeah.  I'm a black ninja.  Wow, that's really confusing.  I really am.  I know you are.  All right, here.  It's the only kind.  Here's, here's, here's.  Apparently.  How'd they come out of a limp biscuit?  All right.  Limpy.  There you go, little limpy biscuit.  I'm doing it nookie style.  I'm Florida's new rock alternative.  I'm doing it nookie style.  Fucking shut up. 
[02:56:00]  All these fucking douchebags.  Well, add West Palm Beach to the list of, uh, markets I will work for free.  Wow.  Get us back in West Palm Beach.  Oh, is this awful?  This is awful radio.  I'm sorry.  A lot of people used to love doing his voice at that station.  As a joke, right?  Yeah.  They make fun of him behind his back, right?  Oh, yeah.  Not to his face, I bet.  Oh, my.  That's how radio works.  God, am I annoyed.  There you go, little limpy biscuit.  Doing it nookie style. 
[02:56:30]  Florida's new rock alternative 103.1.  The Buzz.  It is the new morning buzz.  We are Loper and Smitty.  Something, uh, crazy going on here on the phone.  Smitty, uh, let me just answer this line.  Uh, hello, the morning buzz.  No, I didn't.  I made the volume go up.  I didn't know.  I went beeping, beeping, beeping, beeping.  There's a number up there.  It shows how high up it went.  Hello?  See this?  What does it say there?  Volume?  What the hell?  What is happening?  Is this real?  You want to hear Metallica?  Is that what he said?  Oh, my God.  Mandatory Metallica for that chick in Century Village. 
[02:57:00]  All right, I'll tell you.  First of all, yeah, yeah.  Tear down the wall there.  I'm tearing down a wall.  Tear down the wall because I heard it, too.  They were uncomfortable about the fact that they were using a fake fucking call that they  had to say, is this real?  Because they were like, oh, fuck, someone out there is going to be on to us.  Is this real?  Not only that, when he was live up to the point where he goes, all right, let's go to the  phones, and then it goes to a recording.  And all that was taped.  He goes, something crazy going on.  Let me see.  But meanwhile, that happened like minutes ago during the last song, maybe. 
[02:57:30]  They threw the tape together.  How do you know if it's...  So he's lying about answering the phone.  He's not really answering the phone.  Something's going crazy on the phone if you haven't answered the phone yet.  Play that again.  You can see where it goes to recording.  There you go, little Limpie Biscuit doing it nookie style on Florida's New Rock Alternative  103.1 The Buzz.  It is the new Morning Buzz.  We are Loper and Smitty.  Something crazy going on here on the phone, Smitty.  Let me just answer this line.  Hello, The Morning Buzz.  No, I didn't.  I made the volume go up.  I didn't know.  I went beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  There's a number up there.  It shows how high up it went. 
[02:58:00]  Hello?  Listen for is this real?  What does it say there?  Volume?  What's the hell?  What is happening?  Is this real?  You want to hear Metallica?  Is that what he said?  Mandatory Metallica for that chick in Century Village.  Chick.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Mandatory Metallica!  And you hear his acting.  It's like, let's just go to the phones here.  Sounded so natural.  Is this real?  Because you know it's not.  Oof.  Wow.  We need a lot more of this show.  Loper and Smitty talk about how excited people are that they won't be talking. 
[02:58:30]  What?  That's a good...  That's a great way to promote yourself.  See, they're taking shots at us.  Yeah.  That they're local.  Right.  They're not going to be talking.  We get it.  Yeah.  That right there is one of my favorite buzz classics.  That is Poe and Angry Johnny, Florida's new rock alternative, 103.1 The Buzz.  What?  One of your favorite altern...  What?  That song is so old. 
[02:59:00]  And it's so wimpy.  New slogan?  They're not just local.  They're loco.  Ho, ho, ho!  They're not just local.  They're loper.  Loper-le.  Loper-le.  That right there is one of my favorite buzz classics.  That is Poe and Angry Johnny, Florida's new rock alternative, 103.1 The Buzz.  It is Loper and Smitty, the new morning buzz, and lots of calls coming in. 
[02:59:30]  So glad you guys are not yapping all morning.  Thanks for the buzz music.  Well, get used to it.  The healthy dose of buzz music every day between 6 and 10 is going to be jammed down your throats,  and you're going to love it.  Brave motherfuckers making fun.  How about you call the Opie and Anthony show and say it to our fucking faces?  Yeah.  Douchebag.  And by the way, we could play music if we wanted to, very easily.  You try fucking talking.  Go ahead. 
[03:00:00]  Let's see what creative fucking genius comes out of the likes of you two douchebags.  I would love to hear them try to carry a talk show for fucking 15 minutes.  15 minutes.  15.  They couldn't even do it.  Without drinking a Lope Weiser.  For one minute.  With their Lope Weiser and your stupid fucking kids.  No one wants to hear about your kids.  And finally, we get Loper talks about his name.  Finally.  That's something I don't want to hear.  And they crack another Lope Weiser.  Oh, no, they don't.  Okay. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, jeez.  And for those that don't know, Jeremy Loper in this two-year period, or four-year period,  when he ventured out into the country, went by the name Rex with three X's.  Do we really have to get into that?  Rex with three X's.  And then he tried to be Rex with three X's in Delaware.  He lost an X, right?  So then he was Rex with two X's, and then they made our banner, which only had one X,  and now Rex has gone altogether.  Jeremy Loper, it's good to have you back.  J-Lo on the radio.  It's a triumphant return of J-Lo on the radio.  J-Lo, can you crack me a Lope Weiser, please? 
[03:01:00]  I will.  Thank you.  Frosty and cold.  All right, I got an announcement to make.  I will, and I swear to God, call the press.  I will be out of radio in less than a year.  I can't do this anymore.  Mark my word, I'm done.  I am fucking done for my mental health.  Done.  Time to look into other shit.  Unbelievable.  This is what replaced us in fucking West Palm Beach, Florida, and the corporate doesn't  understand why I'm okay with this.  And then say, whatever, I won't get it. 
[03:01:30]  I would just love to see how they do.  Huh?  Actually, playing music, who knows?  They'll probably shove music down their throat the whole time, so that's an easy thing to do.  It's an easy fix.  You need someone to push the buttons and crack open the Lope Weisers.  Every so often, a nice, crusty Lope Weiser.  Well, this talk radio is out.  It's all about going local, so you're going to get more of these fucking local shows doing 
[03:02:00]  nothing.  And playing music.  That's why, you know, we got the national audience with the XM, thank God.  And Cesar in West Palm Beach, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing today?  All right.  Hey, man.  You guys are absolutely right.  These guys are fucking terrible.  Terrible.  But it's a trend down here.  We've always had terrible morning radio.  We start off with...  They start off with Howard Stern.  After Howard Stern, they gave us David Lee Roth.  After David Lee Roth, you guys came.  When I finally saw a ray of light, I was like, oh, shit, we're going to have some good radio. 
[03:02:30]  They take you guys off and put these high-pitched bitches on the freaking radio.  Can you imagine waking up in the morning, going to work at six in the morning, hearing these  high-pitched voices just screaming into your ear?  I gave them the benefit of the doubt at the beginning.  I was like, well, let me listen and see what's going on.  Forget about it.  I went out that afternoon and bought an XM radio, boys.  Forget about it.  Yeah, I think we turned a bunch of people on to XM down in West Palm because of the switch.  I appreciate it.  I guess what I'm trying to get at is simple.  And, you know, we definitely try to be honest on the show. 
[03:03:00]  Let's say Howard goes back to regular radio.  And all of a sudden, someone goes, holy shit, Howard's going back to regular radio.  We're going to pick them up.  We're going to pick his show up and dump Opie and Anthony.  I can at least understand why someone would decide that's what they need to do.  It's a proven show.  Right.  Track record, all that shit, right?  It would hurt.  It would still hurt, but I would understand.  Like, all right, I get it because of his history.  But to be replaced by this shit, oh, my God. 
[03:03:30]  This is a case of a program director who wants complete control over his morning show and  now has it.  And this PD can go in there and say whatever the fuck he wants to these guys and they will  jump.  They will do whatever he says and stay right between the fucking lines that he sets, play  the songs he wants them to play at the times he wants to play and air check with them and  go, when you talked and said this, you should have gone in this direction. 
[03:04:00]  Like, he can justify his job by having these guys in here.  Well, by having you guys on in the morning, he just does nothing.  He does nothing.  He sits there and twiddle his dick.  So he does nothing.  Yeah.  And he can't say anything to you.  No.  Because you guys respond to a higher...  Yeah.  Are we going to listen to him?  Fuck him.  And why would you brag that you're going to be playing a lot of music, you idiot?  If that's...  I have to be a program director.  All right, wait.  I could maybe quit and just be a program director. 
[03:04:30]  Hmm.  You're going to be the program director?  Yeah.  The only one in the entire business.  That's my goal.  Another one in their market.  No, but all kidding aside, though, like, if that's the angle you're taking, like, you  want to play a lot of music, as a show, you shouldn't be bragging that you're going to  be playing a lot of music.  Let the fucking station do that, you know, with their sweepers and stuff.  But not you as the guy that's opening up the mic going, hey, I just want to tell you, 
[03:05:00]  man, this is going to be great because we're going to play a lot of music and we're barely  going to talk.  They gave away orange juice.  What?  Is that what I'm saying?  Tell me I'm not really seeing this.  What are you talking about?  Today, OJ was freed from jail.  So to celebrate, we're offering free OJ to our listeners starting at 5 p.m. in Colony  Center.  Enjoy.  Stop it. 
[03:05:30]  Just stop it.  Stop it!  Holy.  There you go.  There's your local angle.  Free orange juice at a fucking, fucking fuck.  This is fucking, like, I cannot even deal with, with, with, I love it.  Wow.  Logan in Indiana, what's up?  What's up, man?  I'm, I'm looking at this stuff.  Loper and Smitty.  It's like, it's like Stroker and shitty coming on. 
[03:06:00]  It's like horrible.  How do they, how does that take over?  Don't try to, don't try to cover up your bad fucking joke, sir.  Oh, you, how you kiss my ass?  All right, sir.  I'm sorry, I'm injured.  Thank you.  Let's, uh, let's, yeah.  I wonder why, I wonder why you guys got kicked off and have no listeners.  What?  Thanks, anyways.  Click.  You suck.  Click.  Fuck you, yeah.  Fuck you.  You suck.  That blows.  The listeners that aren't getting hung up on love it.  Let's go to Norm in Philly. 
[03:06:30]  Norm.  Yo, what's up, Bo?  Hey, man.  You forgot the obvious.  Spudgweiser.  Hey.  Oh, for Spudg Buckley.  Fucking asshole.  See, that's how you talk.  You tell someone they're a fucking asshole.  No, no, that was an awesome phone call.  Awesome.  Well, well, something weird's going on on the phone.  Oh, I feel it.  Let's pick up the phone and see what it is.  Oh, that's awesome.  No, you go, you're a fucking asshole.  But, you know, I like to dig.  Let's go to Dan at PA. 
[03:07:00]  What's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Yep.  Hey, I have a suggestion.  Yep.  I don't know how you screwed with Tyler Banks.  Yep.  Why don't you guys do that with this radio station?  Yeah, I think the pests are doing their own thing.  You know.  All right, fuck it up.  I don't feel like getting a phone call from corporate.  Can you tell your pests to stop?  We're really trying to get something done down there.  I love that.  Whatever.  The pests will do what they're going to do.  Put a call out.  Huh?  That's so great that you can just put a call out.  Do you remember the station got upset over the summer because we didn't participate in 
[03:07:30]  their drive for getting school supplies for kids by filling up a school bus?  Are you shitting me?  What?  I didn't hear about this.  They were asking if we'd promote it, and I think we looked at it and went, no.  Fill up a bus with school supplies?  There is no way we would fill it up with ninjas and drive it over a cliff.  That's flies.  You know how they could be with their ninja masks. 
[03:08:00]  They're very deadly.  They're scary.  Yes.  That's who they were for.  Was it?  That's who the supplies were for.  Oh, was it sending them all the way to Japan?  Yes.  Yeah, wow.  Every ninja looks alike.  You can't even tell them a part.  I know.  They wear the hood.  Right.  Yes.  They're very scary.  And they're silent.  I love that about them.  They can climb up walls.  Yes.  You've got to watch them.  I've seen many ninja movies.  Let's go to Phil in Delaware.  Phil?  Phil? 
[03:08:30]  Phil?  What?  I live in southern Delaware, and I listened to these jokesters for a little while.  We had a true, good FM radio show before them, and in true ONA style, they pushed the envelope  too far and got kicked off the air.  Then these guys came on.  Absolute joke.  Fans pushed them off the air, and now they're down in West Palm Beach.  I found XM.  I found you guys, and I'm not changing anything.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that. 
[03:09:00]  Unfortunately, we don't have any more Loper and Smitty for today.  Oh, no.  They're not on the air right now.  Damn it.  Why aren't they on?  They just got off.  We just missed.  Nice gig, if you could get it.  We got part one.  When we get back, we got Stalker Patty Gets High, part two by Derek.  Part one was such a hit.  And we're going to talk about another asshole in radio.  Some fucking broad that's stalking me.  I'm a little thirsty.  Oh.  A little thirsty. 
[03:09:30]  I have such a lot to choose from.  Can I have a Than Adams?  Oh.  Frosty cold.  Just like Than.  I want something, too, though.  Cold and distant.  Bobby wants something, too.  Could you give him a cock?  He loves when it comes in the can.  Wow.  Yes, of course.  Sorry.  He likes the long necks. 
[03:10:00]  Long necks and big helmets.  Lopizer.  Fucking A.  This is what replaced us.  See?  Enjoy, West Palm.  This is why reason number 285, why radio stinks.  Thank God I got a few money, man.  That's all I have to say.  Thank the fuck God.  I don't have enough, though.  I don't have enough.  Really?  Yeah.  I went a little, you know, a little beyond my means.  You can team up with Ronnie. 
[03:10:30]  Me and Ronnie.  Because I got enough.  I hope he's out.  I hope he's out.  I look at Anthony's face like, oh, shit.  But Ronnie and Ant would have a great show.  I just can't deal with this shit too much longer.  The Ron and Anthony show.  They would do fine.  That's all I'm saying.  I just.  We can throw him on Black Phillip.  Dude.  And then.  I'm biting my lips so bad today.  But anyway, we'll get into this asshole Darian O'Toole next.  Who's just obsessed with us in general.  And me particularly. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  For some reason.  Because I have red hair like her.  That's why she fucking is obsessed with me.  We never even met this girl.  And by the way, my hair is more blonde than red, you fucking whore.  Jesus Christ.  Well, this was on a radio website.  I've never met this chick.  And she's saying some pretty fucked up shit about me.  We'll get into that next and other things.  It's Opie.  Other things.  There is a new element of vulgarity.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:11:30]  It's outrageous.  Fuck you.  More ammo.  Fuck you.  Damages our children.  Go fuck yourself.  And diminishes their future.  Oodle.  Oodle.  This is a tragedy for the society.  Opie and Anthony.

[03:18:00]  this fucking broad man they brought her into new york back in the day let me tell you something about  this broad they brought her into new york city to be the female howard stern  on new york radio she was advertised as the big female howard stern  and she lasted a mere few months  yep she got her ass kicked  and uh she's been in communique with our own e-rock because e-rock has to talk to all the radio people 
[03:18:30]  why is that and she's been claiming that she's like  i thought i thought that was an order but it's  like something he just likes to do and she she uh she was claiming that she was going to be  this is what she's claimed recently right yeah and dude if it's bullshit you gotta tell me because i  don't feel like getting sued no she has claimed that she's going to be on the view  that never happened december 4th  oh now it's december 4th december 4th she's coming into new york city and what happened the last time 
[03:19:00]  she was supposed to do the view she wouldn't explain other than her trip was delayed  she's also uh claiming that she was going to be uh replacing us in philly  right but then that turned into she was going to be taking afternoons at ysp  yeah she's out of her fucking mind in my humble opinion and she claimed that um bob  was representing her and then she sent me a message a few days later that uh bob didn't  have time to represent her so he dropped her yeah that was it so i guess she did this 10 
[03:19:30]  questions thing on uh one of the websites and she talks about aunt and i a lot and me  in particular for some reason and i've never met this broad never met her never met the broad  so uh just some highlights from this fucked up interview mornings in new york at q104 followed  great ex at okay she comes to new york to do q104 okay i guess uh great experience but it was an  ill-conceived station at the time it's stupid stupid publicity i literally got off the plane and 
[03:20:00]  walked by my mug on the cover of a magazine that said the female howard stern has arrived  what magazine was she on is she insane probably like stepping out or one of those free ones but  stepping out is this the new queen of all media dumb move on management's part why that's how  she was pretty much billing herself that's what i'm yeah yeah she had yeah she was in on those  fucking like meetings before she decided to do this you don't attack the best talent on the planet 
[03:20:30]  on the first day you sneak up on them needless to say it didn't work despite some of my best work  and he crushed me with one swat of his paw  so then they get into the 10 questions right what do you do to maintain a positive mental attitude and  stay motivated motivation has never been a problem for me i'm a woman on a mission  mediocrity irritates the crap out of me and long before the secret stated the obvious 
[03:21:00]  i understood the law of attraction whatever i put out i get back when i'm a bitch i get in shit  when i'm positive and well behaved i win it's not like i need an anvil to fall on my head i'm not  the road runner just follow the basic tenets of quantum physics and you'll be all good the anvil  by the way never fell on the road runner's head no coyote usually missed horribly yeah and the  road runner ran off at high speed and usually the coyote would wind up getting an anvil on his head 
[03:21:30]  somehow right now he'd fall on something it would flip off and flip back and hit him on the head so  she's wrong on that count and then around seven lumps would pop up right and he'd take a little  hammer and go and hammer them back into his head thank you uh continue well uh this brings up a  fine fine um she talks about mediocrity right well we got audio of her uh our show let's say we got

[03:27:00]  why katie holmes  would take a 14 hour  plane trip to australia  last week  australia  seven and a half months  pregnant  just to attend  the funeral  of a man  she never met  the answer would  probably  just i'm just guessing  because  my fiance is a psycho  i can't  i'm just saying  not  i'm not judging  just saying  right  triple eight  five hundred  one oh six nine  oh my god

[03:49:00]  she used to  hotline your show  when you were at  any w she was  doing mornings at  q and you guys  used to talk  about um  things going on  with howard and  internal goings on  at clear channel  where she was  another load of  bullshit what's  she talking about  what the fuck  i've never hotline  we never talked  to her it didn't  make sense but  this was a long  time ago she  told me this  she's delusional  man she used to  call you guys and  you guys would  swap insider info  she called us  i would never  remember to 
[03:49:30]  call from her  at home  we would step  for a call  i was so  she cried  maybe i had  too many  i don't know  maybe i had  too many low  plisers  i think it was  low plisers  i think it was  low plisers  go home  i think i  would go  on the show  i had too many  low plisers  sat in the  mood for  saving  hell  see she  dead  look at my  teddy  ladies  there's a  man  she called 
[03:50:00]  us  how come  we could  just do  this  all  that is  so much  fun  this is  fun  can you  pass me  a low  plis  low plis  yeah  what are you  what are you  showing people  eric  this is a  we were  here for  happening  yeah  that was  a recent  text  she's  lately she's  been telling  me  information  she hears  that she  talks to  all these  cbs  execs  about how  they don't  like you  guys in 
[03:50:30]  the show  and all  of a sudden  i start  getting texts  that are  just gibberish  and when i  call her out  i'm like are  you on  something are  you drunk  she gets  all mad  and defensive  and then you  don't hear  from her  for a few  days  then out  of the  blue  she starts  saying so  i hear i'm  in shit  with opie  and anthony  i hadn't  heard from  her in  three four  days  i have  no idea  that she's  alive until  today  until you  started telling  me about  this shit  actually  give a fuck  about her  what the hell  is this  it's gibberish  that's how she  writes back  oh  she can't even  get the keys  right 
[03:51:00]  yeah that  isn't even  i'm trying  to  i like how  you have to  write what  are you  talking about  i'm trying  to text  man  and it  comes out  tv  i don't  know how  to text  oh  page  the buttons  with letters  on them  and i think  i'm making  words  i just felt  steve's hot  sick breath  on my neck 
[03:51:30]  fever breath  he probably got  fever balls  down to his  knees  big turkish  taffy nuts  jesus  melted  taffy  so we're  all in the  trenches  together in  new york  and have  mad love  for open  danny  i consider  the three  of us  the red  headed  trifecta  of great  radio  oh wow  how does  that feel  being lumped  into the  likes of  that  darren  o'toole  lasted  four months  danny  might have  done a  year in  town  yeah  maybe  i don't  even know  it's about  a year 
[03:52:00]  but why  he insists  on biting  the hand  that feeds  him is  beyond me  greg  just gotta  use my  real name  with  two g's  to show  that she  knows  a little  bit  about  me  greg  is one  of the  smartest  funniest  people  in the  business  but like  anyone  with huge  talent  he can  be a  narcissistic  jerk  hell bent  on self  destruction  whoa  danny and i  have that in  common as well  but danny had  the good sense  to commit his  mistakes on  camera  and i had  but i was  drunk and  didn't know  what  no i was  naked  working for 
[03:52:30]  me  ope's  just being  a dick  and i'm  not shy  about saying  that to  his face  well it's  not  she's in  town next  week if  you want  to have  her in  studio  have her  come in  have her  come in  tell her we  have plenty  of vodka  and red bull  if she wants  it  you can have  her and patty  just slap  each other  in the face  his anatomy  could you call  her right now  because i want  to invite her  personally to be  on our radio  show  why wait  till next week  get that dummy  on the phone

[04:02:00]  with you  because darian  you're like  lying in these  in these articles  um  you're like  lying on the air  in this interview  and i  we have every right  to hate john  john cook  and i  and i explained  that to corporate  and uh  to anyone that  would listen  so we have  every right  to  why did you  why did you  get kicked  out of philly  why did you  get kicked  out of philly  because they  because they  want to go local  and they  really  or was it  because you  were an  asshole  because you  were insulting  someone who  was nice  to you  who was backing  a brink truck  up to your  mansion 
[04:02:30]  mansion  first of all  first of all  they have to  continue paying  us  and that's  why we  can't work  down there  until uh  i think  april  why were you  why were you  shitty to  danny  bonaduce  what are you  talking about  why were you  shitty to him  you're  shitty to him  now  shitty to him  no  maybe  well we had  a reason  if he got  on uh  the show  and was  was bashing  us  it's like  darian's a bit  obsessed with  our radio  show  no no  because let's  let's just  you're a bit  obsessed with  our radio 
[04:03:00]  show  right  because what  because what  what  if someone  you're going to  edit this later  so let's just  yeah i know  darian  if you  if someone  doesn't kiss  your ass  you screw  them up  no  we don't  talk to anybody  my god  we don't even  talk to anybody  we don't talk to  anybody in this  business  99% of the  people on this  planet don't  kiss our ass  darian  listen  listen to me  you twat  1% of the  people  this is what  happened with  danny  bonaduce  when we got 
[04:03:30]  in our latest  trouble  we thought  we thought  shut the  fuck  up  we thought  that he  trashed us  on uh  fox uh  i think it was  fox or something  about our  situation  and then we  listened back  to the tape  and we  actually  admitted on  the air  that we  were wrong  with what  uh  happened that  day with  him on tv  talking about  us  okay  all right  and john 
[04:04:00]  and the reason  i don't like  john cook is  i don't respect  the guy that  uh refused to  communicate with  us after he  said that we  were going to  be the future  of ysp and  be doing their  morning show  okay  yeah and  yeah okay  yeah that's  exactly what  happened  i mean  you're in  with the cba  that's not  even you're  in with cbs  execs and you  say how cbs  hates us and  also why don't  you ask him  because why don't  you go call up  chris olivero he  knows exactly  what happened  for whatever  reason john  cook decided to  stop communicating  with us because  they were going to 
[04:04:30]  go in another  direction and he  didn't have the  balls to tell me  to my face or  call us on the  phone that's  exactly what  happened and  that's why i  have a problem  with the guy  okay  you think chris  didn't know  about that what  are you stupid  come on you're  smarter than  that  why am i arguing  with the fucking  lunatic  did you just hear  what i said  did you just hear  did you just hear  what i said  same reason i am  did you just hear  what he said  i don't understand  uh why you're not  uh you know doing  a radio show with  this with this  quickness you got  you're a mess go  get fucking help

The wacky stunt is trying to get through a conversation with somebody.  It's called Dumb Cunt Monday.  Guess who the guest is.  That's our new feature.  New feature.  Welcome.  It's the inaugural cunt. 
[04:21:00]  It's actually, today's bit is called Radio Has Been Monday.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Stay tuned next week as we have the Greaseman on.  That's right.  Do you and the Greaseman talk about the glory days that lasted ten minutes?  Bring him back from the dead.  Have a seance.  Go ahead.  Wow.  Wow.  It's the type of cutting edge radio we could expect.  Please stop being obsessed with our radio show and for some reason me in general. 
[04:21:30]  Get lost, you twat.  Go back to the fucking radio graveyard.  You couldn't handle the stress and the pressure of doing morning radio in New York and it  fucked you up, obviously.  You haven't recovered since.  Ah, but I did.  And you're not going to be on the fucking view, okay?  Oh, really?  If you are, please be hammered.  And the official...  That would be hysterical.  I said, Bob.  Bob is doing this? 
[04:22:00]  Tom Cruise is just...  And just to keep it fair, you were on Q104.  You were on Q104 for ten months.  Ten months.  Ten?  How did you get that?  Google bitch?  What?  Yeah.  How about yeah?  What's wrong with Google?  A couple of people use it, I hear.  Damien, what's wrong with you?  I'm just enjoying it.  I think that you're in your prime.  That's fine.  If you want to be in the A-old, do you be in the A-old. 
[04:22:30]  Hey, does this prove that she's not going to be in the A-old right here?  I am in my prom.  Yeah, we're going to edit this.  Edit it like you did.  Edit it.  I gave you credit.  I gave you credit.  Do you understand how this works?  Do you understand your...  You do understand you're live right now, right?  Darian, do you know you're live right now?  How are we going to edit this if you're live, you dummy?  Because you're saying fucking, so you're obviously on XM.  Yeah, but it's not reality TV show.  So it's not edited.  So it's not edited.  Whoa!  Let me explain something.  Okay.  This dumb cunt thinks that this was so great, we're going to bring it over to our regular 
[04:23:00]  show.  You're fucking filler, you twat.  You're what we call phoning it in.  You're filler.  I wouldn't fucking bring a piece of this over to the regular side.  Are you fucking kidding me, you delusional bitch?  Well, you know what?  You delusional asshole.  Let me tell you something.  What?  How do you spell that?  Do you want to hear it?  Do you want to hear it?  Do you want to know? 
[04:23:30]  What?  You've been called barely mediocre, used to be talented, used to be funny.  Is she talking about me or you guys?  By who?  Opie.  I don't, Anthony, I've never met you.  I don't know you.  No, no, by who?  Holy shit, you never met me, too.  Oh my God.  Who called us?  Flying out of his ass.  Who called us that?  Who called, yeah, who called us that?  You know what?  Opie, I respect that.  Oh, she's not even going to answer.  Who called us that?  If I was an Olympic sport, I would have brought on the gold, okay?  You want me live?  What did she say?  You want to know the truth? 
[04:24:00]  I don't know, something about her, something in her ass.  You were telling the truth, you were telling people what happened in New York with Mark  Parenteau and how our friendship came to be.  Friendship?  Now it's not even just meeting, it's a friendship.  No joke, I've got to get a restraining order.  I'm not even kidding.  You're crazy.  You know what?  You can't, yeah, 18 shades of crazy.  I admit that.  She used that.  You used that.  What is that?  December 5th.  You got nothing.  All right, December 5th.  Okay.  Wait, wait, hold on.  You defer to, like, humor. 
[04:24:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, Darian, hold on.  I'm looking at December 5th right here, and the news says that The View will be co-hosted  by Obama's wife.  I'm not, don't laugh.  It says Michelle Obama, wife of presidential candidate Barack Obama, will be guest host  on the television talk show The View next month.  Yeah, Barack's going to be on The View.  No, his wife, Michelle Obama, is going to co-host The View. 
[04:25:00]  It's from that shitty CNN website.  Yeah, you know that one, you can't rely on, CNN.  You're fucking lying.  Darian, you're not going to be on The Fucking View.  Say it.  I kind of feel sorry for you.  Just say it.  I don't.  It's really funny.  I love watching someone just fucking fall apart like this.  Oh, yeah, I'm falling apart.  You've fallen apart.  You're a delusional woman who really kind of lost touch with reality, it seems, a while 
[04:25:30]  ago, and you never kind of came back.  A while ago?  When was I ever in reality?  Go back to Canada and recoup with your parents again.  Now, that's just nasty.  It is nasty, but it's the truth.  It's the truth.  You maybe should relax a little more.  You're fucking, like, Darian, you're out of control.  You're just spreading like you're a compulsive liar because you're making shit up. 
[04:26:00]  You sound, like I said, I don't know you personally, but you sound like somebody who has...  Oh, you don't know me?  No.  Yet, somehow you have my personal phone number at eight in the morning.  I don't.  E-Rock had it.  Yeah, okay.  Holy mother of God.  Who's that?  Oh.  Elo?  There's someone, like...  Offer you a job?  Like, it's a job.  I'm sure...  Yeah.  You're like a...  Hello?  A crazy woman.  I'm still here.  No, I'm talking to somebody. 
[04:26:30]  Yeah, we know you're still here.  Right, you're not talking to somebody.  She's a compulsive liar?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Who's...  Oh, is that someone that knows her?  Yeah.  So, you're going to co-host The View.  So, you've spoken to Barbara Walters?  Anything else?  Do you want to get anything else?  You've spoken to Barbara Walters about this co-hosting gig?  No, I have not.  Oh, well...  I have never spoken to Barbara Walters.  Who are you going to be on The View when they're saying that it's Obama's wife? 
[04:27:00]  Do you listen to me?  December 5th.  Answer?  Question.  I didn't hear it.  Are you going to be on The View...  All I heard was about Barbara Walters.  No, I've never met Barbara Walters.  Are you going to be on The View when it says that Obama's wife, Michelle, is going to be  on The View?  I have no idea.  Now you have no idea.  You said before it was guaranteed.  You were ready to bet $5,000.  I don't know if Obama's...  I don't know who the guest is. 
[04:27:30]  I have a clue.  No, she's guest hosting.  Silly.  You're silly goose.  You were ready to bet $5,000.  Now you're not sure.  When you're 90?  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  She's not...  You done?  Are we...  Like, what else?  Is there anything else?  I don't know.  Anything else that upsets you?  Are you, you know...  Not upset.  Any other quandaries?  Not upset.  We do have to go, though.  You are.  You're pissed that I called dick.  It's that simple.  Oh, my God.  The day...  Admit it. 
[04:28:00]  Admit it.  The day I would get pissed that anybody called me a dick, I'd be pissed 24 hours a day.  I'm running out of show.  Listen to me.  I'm not...  Who would care about being called a dick?  I don't give a shit that you called me a dick.  I give a shit that you're acting like you know us.  We've been in the trenches together.  That we met, that we talked.  I don't know you.  I don't like people talking about me and making believe they know me when they have never  met me.  That's what I'm pissed at.  You silly asshole.  Hey, goodbye.  Someone called me a dick on Pal Talk. 
[04:28:30]  Why you...  Goodbye, Darren.  I ought to...  Mr. Man!  So tell us about Tom Cruise.  And your inimitable Red Bull style.  Congratulations.  You finally got to talk to an audience on the radio.  You made the big time.  This is 15 minutes.  This is it.  That's it.  Okay.  Goodbye.  We'll edit it down to zero so we can replay it.  Line of the Day was brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  And it was Darian O'Toole.  Free live scoring stats, bios, and news that will help you win big this season and fantasy 
[04:29:00]  football all at BodogFantasy.net.  Yes, E-Rock?  No.  Just say one.  Oh, okay.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  RobertKelleyLive on MySpace, too.  Yeah, hit me up.  I got dates.  I'm at the Laughing House in Michigan.  It's a very important point.  I don't give a shit she calls me a dick.  I give a shit that she acts like she knows me.  That's, for some reason, that really bothers me when people do that shit.  She's nuts.  All right?  That's what really bothers me. 
[04:29:30]  Because I don't need fucking people going, whoa, is he really pissed that she called him  a dick?  No.  I'm pissed that she acted like she knows us and we've been in the trenches together and  all this bullshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Trenches.  She was in 10 months.  And she was there before we ever even got to New York.  So I think the carryover time was probably three months that we were both on the air.  And by the way, I think, well, I'm not sure who we were going to replace, but they wanted  us to do mornings at Q104 and we decided the time to stay where we were at. 
[04:30:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
