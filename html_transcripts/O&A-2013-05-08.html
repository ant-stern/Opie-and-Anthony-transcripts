<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of a recent, frustrating meeting with SiriusXM executives, specifically Scott Greenstein and Steve Blatter.  The hosts expressed anger over negative listener feedback regarding their new, one-hour weekly podcast,  criticizing the perceived lack of value and short length.  Other meeting topics included studio improvements (resulting in the inexplicable addition of two oversized garbage cans), and a bizarre proposed Islanders-themed event at Nassau Coliseum. The hosts detailed their frustration with the executives' focus on business models over creative freedom, punctuating their account with anecdotes and displays of exasperation, such as Opie throwing his arms up.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the Cleveland kidnapping case,  featuring off-color jokes and commentary on media coverage.

The show then delved into a detailed and graphic discussion of the Ariel Castro kidnapping case, focusing on the horrific abuse suffered by the three victims, including their ages at the time of kidnapping (14 and 16) and the birth of a child during captivity.  The hosts condemned the police's failure to respond to numerous prior reports of suspicious activity at Castro's house and discussed the involvement of Castro's brothers. The conversation included violent imagery and offensive language, expressing anger and disgust at the crimes.  This segment also touched upon other notorious kidnapping cases like those of Katie Beers and Colleen Stan,  exploring the psychology of perpetrators (using Ted Bundy and Joel Rifkin as examples) and the perceived ineffectiveness of the prison system as a deterrent.  Comedian Tom Papa was a guest in the studio during this segment.  A significant portion was dedicated to analyzing the actions and statements of Charles Ramsey, the neighbor who helped rescue the women, highlighting inconsistencies in his interviews and playing his uncensored 911 call.  The hosts speculated on Ramsey’s potential rise to celebrity status and the impact of constant news coverage on society's attention span and empathy, mentioning the increasing prevalence of surveillance technology like Google Glass.


The next segment centered on Charles Ramsey's account of the rescue, focusing on his description of the event, including the use of McDonald's french fries grease to lubricate a lock, and Amanda Berry’s surprisingly well-groomed appearance.   The hosts and callers, employing frequent offensive language, criticized the 911 operator,  with a former dispatcher caller providing insight into system flaws.  A comedic auto-tuned song about Ramsey was played.  The discussion also included a news story about an ABC News producer, Don Ennis, dressing as a woman named Dawn at work.  The segment concluded with a scene reading from a new cop drama, "The Goose," featuring one of the hosts as the titular character, a tough detective.


The following segment opened with humorous disapproval of older men cross-dressing, transitioning to a “Trust a Listener” segment featuring Jimmy from Staten Island and his elaborate Christmas light displays.  The hosts then launched into a vulgar discussion of Governor Chris Christie's weight loss and his pants, detailing various weight loss surgeries in graphic terms.  They speculated on Christie’s motivations, including a possible presidential run. The conversation returned to cross-dressing, including anecdotes from callers about gender transitions, focusing on chosen names and behaviors.  A caller recounted a dramatic story about a transitioning news director, followed by humorous stories about a reporter who infiltrated their show and a discussion of various types of lesbians and the hosts' reactions to their appearance. A listener described an older, cross-dressing man on the Upper West Side, leading to a discussion about spy glasses and plans to film him without consent.  Further caller information about this man was shared, and societal acceptance of cross-dressing and transitioning was debated. This was followed by a lengthy, fictional scenario involving Chip, a character who makes offensive workplace remarks, and potential lawsuits.  The segment concluded with discussions of Ariel Castro, a caller’s daughter needing buttock surgery, and plugs for upcoming appearances, interspersed with calls about CPAP machines, weight loss, and relationship issues.

The final segment consisted primarily of listener calls.  Bob discussed human desire for technological immortality; John warned against farm-raised tilapia; Susan from Pennsylvania considered leaving her long-term boyfriend due to his debt and long work hours, prompting a heated exchange with Anthony over her lack of employment and financial contribution; Jim from Jersey discussed his struggles with a no-carb diet; Rob from Jersey recounted a romantic encounter; Mark from Colorado shared his struggle with losing his faith and how to explain it to his children; and Spencer, a recovering addict, discussed the relationship between religion and recovery.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used vulgar and offensive language, particularly toward Susan.  The show concluded with a brief discussion of weight loss plateaus and advice for a recovering addict questioning his faith.

[00:02:00]  The brass  The head muckety-muck  The muckety-mucks  The big wig  Type of meeting  Yeah  Yeah  Well  A lot was discussed  Should we start with what good came out of it?  What was the good?  It was one good thing  Oh, the podcast  Yes  Yeah, I tweeted about that yesterday  Yeah  But then already the Twitter fucking idiot 
[00:02:30]  Oh no, what are they?  That's all I see though  They have a problem with everything  I have a happy tweet  Happy to announce that  Finally after  Working on this for a long time  We're going to have an Opie and Anthony podcast available  One hour a week  And it's going to be free  The next tweet  How much is this going to cost us?  Did you just read the tweet? 
[00:03:00]  Fucking assholes  That's a waste of time  Just an hour  Oh, holy fuck  So I just turned off my Twitter again  Now I just turn off my computer  Are you kidding?  Then I sneak back on  Hoping these idiots are gone  Hey Opie  How could this  How could that tweet be a problem?  There's not one person that should bitch about that  Because first of all 
[00:03:30]  If you don't like it  You'd never even have to know it exists  Right  There's nothing there that's going to cost you money  Right  Or be a problem to you  Right  I actually wrote  What channel is that going to be on?  What?  I'm talking about a podcast  Like iTunes  But in all fairness  In all fairness  Because the positive absolutely outweighs the negative on the Twitter and our fan base  You know  You know  A lot of people 
[00:04:00]  Very very excited about it  Sure  But then you get these just idiots  They're just idiots  That's why  Only an hour?  Yeah  That's the podcast world  Yeah  You put an hour out there  That's why you hear things like 95% of people surveyed  Nine out of ten doctors surveyed  Right  Things like that  Because it could never be everyone  Because there's always got to be some fucking asshole  That  But we pay way too much attention to them  I'm paying way too much attention to them right now 
[00:04:30]  The squeaky douche  Yes  Gets the douche oil  Gets the fucking water and vinegar  Gets the summer eve  I couldn't believe it  I'm like  How is this a problem?  Ah  Yeah  It'll be free  Because I said it was going to be free  Oh my god  How much are you holding us up for on this one?  Nothing  And it's mostly  Geared 
[00:05:00]  For our purposes  Right  Geared toward people that have no idea  Who we are  What this show is  Right  But are in the podcast universe  They'll see  Because I think we'll do very well  As far as the charting goes  I hope so  And then  You know  You get new people  That'll be turned on to that  And be like  Oh  Who the fuck are these guys?  It'll lead to some subscriptions  Perhaps  Sure  But it also helps out some of the people that  You know  They've fallen on hard times  And they can't really afford this anymore  Ah yeah  So they get a little  They get a little taste 
[00:05:30]  Right  And a little O and A material  To get them through  Eh  It's just  Eh  Always  Always  And I understand the ones that are just fucking around and do that shit  Right right right  But no  They're real people  Yeah  And then  And then you got the positive like listeners trying to explain  Right yeah yeah yeah  Cause I watch  Cause I can't  I'm not  I can't take it all on  So then you get positive people trying to explain to that guy  It still doesn't make a fucking difference 
[00:06:00]  Fuck it  Jesus  And it'll be on iTunes and Stitcher and all that shit  Yeah  And I don't know we'll figure out all the good places  We honestly we want to chart in the podcast universe on iTunes  Yeah  We want to be in that top 10 on a regular basis and hopefully we will be  Yeah  And hopefully it'll lead to subscriptions for SiriusXM  We're not getting a dime from it  No  It actually hurts our deal with Audible  Yeah  We do have a little deal with Audible 
[00:06:30]  We get a little taste of the action there  But  But I think it's way more important to be on iTunes  Yeah  Yeah  With a podcast  Way more important  Than the little taste we get from Audible  Oh  So  The fucking shit  It's just  How do they fucking  I don't understand though man  Those  That I don't understand  You know you don't like a  Like a  You know  A joke tweet or something like that 
[00:07:00]  Fair enough  Yeah sure  Not gonna please everyone  But something that is so god damn over the top positive  How is that a problem?  What is that a problem?  They're dicks  They really are  That's all it is  People are just dicks  Dicks  There's no real reason to a conclusion  They're just dickheads  But it just amazes me  Yeah  I've been in the public eye a really long time  And to this day  Public guy?  I've been in the public eye  And it just amazes me  Yeah  It amazes me 
[00:07:30]  So yeah that came out of the meeting  I think we're gonna try to get it all done for next week  We're gonna try to get it all together  Yeah  It's on the fast track  It's on the fast track  And we thought they would only go for a podcast if we used our old material  Yep  Cause we got what about 8 years of satellite radio material now that's kinda sitting there  We get to it every once in a while on a holiday or  Or if it's been repurposed  Or  Yeah sure  But they don't even care  So we could do an hour of the weekly show too 
[00:08:00]  Yeah  Have something topical newsworthy shit like that  Someone makes a match I guess  Yeah  Yeah  You know  So I think it's very cool  I think it's great  I think it'll  You know  I think we should've been on there right from what they say  The get go  As they say  Well then you get the funny people  And I appreciate them too  Congratulations  What's next?  A website?  Welcome to 2008  And they're right  We have a MySpace page  Right  I hope you enjoy it  I have a good name for it 
[00:08:30]  Yeah?  Opie and Anthony  An Hour of Laughter  Oh  Oh I like it  You don't think that's good?  No  And then the rest of the meeting was just a bunch of bullshit  It was uh  It was  It was Groundhog Day  It's Groundhog Day when we go in there  Cause it's literally the same meeting we had  At one point  Didn't you notice I threw my arms up in the air and I go  This is why I don't like having meetings with you  Yeah you did that and then you also did the uh  We've been through this 
[00:09:00]  Right  Right  Opie gets exasperated  Yeah  I got it I got it I got it I got it  I got it  Oh my god I've been here  I don't even  I don't  I don't understand  Scott  Scott Greenstein  You got me  And then you learn like the guys that are in between us and Scott Greenstein are too scared to talk to Scott Greenstein  That's very obvious  Yeah  So then I start looking at Steve Blatter  I'm like  You never  You never told him 
[00:09:30]  We've been discussing this for two years  Why am I discussing this with you?  And then they go  Cause we learned yesterday at the meeting  That the animation festival is a great idea  Yeah yeah  Apparently  We never really got that across to anybody  That the animation festival was a great fucking event  Right  And we should probably figure out a way to do it again  Right  But  How many years has it been since the animation festival?  It's gotta be five years by now 
[00:10:00]  At least five years  It has to be  And in that five years  You were hanging out with Jill Nicolini  Right  So how long ago was that?  Oh my god  Five years probably?  Four or five years?  Opie it seems like a thousand  Oh well what are you gonna do?  But apparently in that five years  We never mentioned how great an idea it was  Right  And that we want to do it again  I don't think in five years we mentioned it  Probably should have brought it up at least  We probably should have brought it up  And he even asked me  Well what's the cost?  You know as far as this event goes  As far as this event goes 
[00:10:30]  I go there's no cost  You're not paying us extra money to be there  We usually get some up and coming comics to kind of entertain the crowd  They don't want any money  They don't want any money  They just want the exposure  And then we got our listeners doing all the work  You need like the venue  You need some AV equipment there to play the shit up on a big screen  But it's not  But I've been told over the years that you know cost too much this and that  And then I learned yesterday that the main guy doesn't even know  It was never presented to him 
[00:11:00]  It was never presented to him  What name did he pull out to get that together?  He's got a great gag  He's got a great gag  He turns to Steve no matter what idea we talk about  Or fucking any kind of thing we want to do  He turns to Blatter and just blurts out a name I've never heard in my life  Steve, get Laurie Christensen on that one  Get Laurie Christensen on that one  And we're like what?  Who the fuck?  He goes get her right on it  She's gonna like this one  She's gonna like getting involved in it  And they're like okay 
[00:11:30]  How about we need  We want to do something  You know promotion show  Alright alright  That's a good idea  Steve, Steve  Get Bob Smith on it  Yeah  Get Bob Smith on that one  He's a good guy  He's the guy that could really spearhead this one  I don't know who these people are  It's right out of the corporate handbook  Yes it is  It's all bullshit  Yeah  That's why I hate doing it  I hate the meetings  But I walked away going holy fuck 
[00:12:00]  We got the podcast done  That's definitely done  Yeah  I think  I think  I'll believe it when I see it next week  If we get it done by next week  Hopefully  They might come to us and tell us that they'd like to  But the podcast will cost a half a million dollars to produce  Oh Jesus  So  Because of costs  We can't do it  Well they don't wanna do the podcast  Cause Entertainment Weekly is gonna get a podcast  Right right  They don't wanna step on their toes  He loves the fact that Entertainment Weekly has a channel  And so he takes that  I go what happened with the wall 
[00:12:30]  Cause I haven't talked to him since  Since the day  Like I actually was pointing  Showing him what we needed  And he goes yeah done  No problem  Yeah we'll do that  So I go what happened to the wall  He goes I'm you know we got these high profile shows coming in  I need space  I go but you told me we  You said yes to it  Yeah  What happened  He goes that deals get made  Things happen  Right he has an answer for everything  That just blows away your point  But he didn't say the cost  He said deals get made  Things happen  Of course not  High profile  Not it's a half a million dollars 
[00:13:00]  Right  It was easier to tell us that it would cost way too much  It's not  Right  Probably the reason that look  That they have a show going in there  You're lucky to have the closet that you have  Yeah  Which was a big part of the meeting  We were talking about the studio space  The console  The size of the console  The fact that we  Don't have a lot of room in here  Right  That I have a wall right to my back  That I got to lean forward  Every time people  Go back and forth  They go back and forth a lot  Because they got to get to Opie  To give them various things for the show 
[00:13:30]  And then they set up a camera  When we have like the A blisters coming in  We're stuck in our position for the entire interview  Yeah  Because we can't move past cameras  Can't move past cameras  There's really no fucking room in here  We're stuck in here  Right  Well  So the next morning  The next morning  We just discussed this  We're like there's too much shit in our studio  So at the very least  Because obviously we're stuck with this studio  Yeah  There's some kind of weird promise of  I don't know  They're working on other deals  And it's just nonsense that goes through my brain 
[00:14:00]  I'm like  I just hear  I hear that throughout my day  Yeah  But the next day  We come into the studio  After saying how the place is small  And we got to clean up the clutter  And get rid of some of the  You know clunky furniture  Uh huh  They added two big fucking giant garbage pails  Garbage pails  We walk in here  And uh  Much to our surprise  There are two garbage pails in here  Which by the way  One thing we've never asked for 
[00:14:30]  And never had a problem with  And never addressed management with  Right  Was our lack of garbage pail space  Right  We used to have  We used to have  You know  Just a tiny little waste basket  You had a bathroom size  A house  You're in your house  The bathroom size waste basket  You know the one that's maybe  Eight inches off the ground tops  Because how much garbage  Is Opie generating per day  And I'm not talking about  What's coming out of your mouth  I'm talking about  Literal garbage  Well you would need a dumpster 
[00:15:00]  For that  See  He admitted it  He's useless  I told you  I told my god  Where do I go with this one  Maybe I can find a place  Where it'll go viral  Oh my god  Get a fucking life  Oh my god  By the way  I throw away  Two coffee cups  Whoa  And one oatmeal  Little thing  From Starbucks  Did you ever go to 
[00:15:30]  Anyone in management  And say  Guys  I just don't have enough  Garbage pail space  I don't  I just don't get it  They're trying to fix  Problems we never have  Right  And yet when we do have an issue  A real problem  It just never gets addressed  So they're fixing things  We don't  They just add new weird problems  Yeah  So they're just  They're the biggest garbage pails  You would see these on  On the city street  On city streets  Maybe in a stadium  On the corner  Yes  In a stadium  Those garbage pails  The thing is 
[00:16:00]  In the park  The thing is like  Up to my hip  Yes  It's giant  And there's two of them  There's two of them  You got your own  Probably out of the little alleyway  You had to walk through  Right  Right now they've cut  Probably  33% of your  The space you did have  To walk out of  You know remember when I said  That I don't have enough space  Right  I said I don't have enough space  So their solution to the  I don't have enough space  Yes  Statement  Was to take away more space 
[00:16:30]  Yeah  This is what we deal with around here  They can't even figure this shit out  No  And I had a big garbage pail  But they went with a bigger garbage pail  And I guarantee this was a long meeting  Oh boy  And they decided that the Opie and Anthony studio needs two giant garbage pails in it  For two coffee cups and an oatmeal thing and maybe a newspaper  Yeah  And whatever Ron and Fez throws away  Yeah  That's it  Yeah  But hey 
[00:17:00]  It would take us a month to fill this up  It would be a month  It would be a month  If it was just my shit it would take over a month  And you want the garbage in here changed everyday  Yes because we  Because you don't want it to stink  So  No we're throwing the eggs out  Yeah  And fucking milk products  And  Yeah there's fucking half a tuna fish sandwich going in the garbage  Right  You want that for a month  Right  You want more garbage pail space so what  You can pile more shit on top of it  No you want  You want a smaller garbage pail so it has to be emptied everyday 
[00:17:30]  But  I walked in and I was just thinking to myself  I can't wait for Anthony and Jimmy to see the giant garbage pails  That they have now added to the studio  Thinking logically this makes sense  They're fantastic  At least the rug is clean  I don't know  It's just  It's just  Look at the rug  The rug is fucking filthy  Yeah  It's just  Unbelievable  Sam  Can we figure out or Mars or somebody  I want to find out who decided that we needed these giant garbage pails in here 
[00:18:00]  You'll never get an answer  I know  That's why we're doing this  It'll be a consortium of people that are responsible  Nameless, faceless members that reside upstairs  I think they're fucking with us  I think they're fucking with us  Because down the hall is a tiny little blue waste basket  That's  When you want one of these in the hall where you have a lot of foot traffic  You're fucking right  Look at that  There's a small tiny garbage pail in the hallway where it's a communal garbage pail  So that's a little one  This should absolutely be there and that should be there 
[00:18:30]  I think they're fucking with us  Why would they do that?  I think they fucking just hate our guts  Why do you do that?  Who did we piss off?  There's no way logically this makes sense  Alright guys  Get this  Sit down  You're gonna love this one  Let's put giant garbage pails in this studio  Like these closed door meetings with everybody  Oh that's fucking classic  Or maybe they're trying to throw us off 
[00:19:00]  They're like okay we know they're gonna bitch  But maybe if we throw giant garbage pails in there  They won't bitch about the important things  They'll just bitch about this dumb little thing  They'll be distracted by the shiny object  Right  The big garbage pails  They're huge  There's two of them  I know  This is funny  Kevin from Connecticut just said  Did Opie just really say who did we piss off?  Yeah  That's funny  I don't know what are you gonna do  There's two Sam 
[00:19:30]  There's two  Giant garbage pails in our studio  It couldn't be less necessary  Right?  Yeah  The room feels smaller because of the garbage cans  Yeah  That's how big they are  You could feel it  Plus that's the corner that everybody has to go in to set up the video cameras  It's the worst place for a giant garbage pail  It's the worst place  Guys  At every  You know how at every meeting  They talk about that animation festival?  No matter what  Get this  Guys get this 
[00:20:00]  No matter what happens  Make like we never heard it  At every meeting  It's gotta get them so pissed off  And then  So the animation festival  Which I don't believe will ever happen  I know  But it's the first time Greenstein heard about it  And he thinks it's a great idea  I'm like holy fuck  We should've been up to the fifth one by now  We want to do that once a year  We're very talented people  We thought it would be a great fucking event  That out there  That could do animation very well  They take clips from the show  Right  They animate them 
[00:20:30]  And then we have a big event  And play them  And celebrity panel judges them  And it's just a great night  Yeah  A lot of people  You know  Went there  And the videos are online  I remember originally  People were saying  That it just  It wasn't worth it  Because they couldn't make money off it  Or cost too much money  Always a cost issue  Something like that  Travis  I know why the garbage pails are here  Okay  Oh  I asked my superior  Who's your superior?  Gary  I thought he was out first 
[00:21:00]  I thought he was in DC  It's the magic of text messaging  Right  Oh, oh, okay  And?  This is the first step in cleaning up the studio  What?  Just fill the space that's dirty with garbage cans  So what?  Why not just take the garbage out  And then put two small ones in there  Which would clean up  But these go to eleven  Or what?  Maybe one giant  You don't need two giant garbage pails  Just gonna wheel in one of those big blue dumpsters  Dumpster 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, right  A giant dumpster, Sam  Fucking Chip  Said it  It's mine  Although fucking Dr. Chip yesterday  Had me fucking howling  Yeah, I know  That was like a bit  Very good  It was fucking roaring  Dr. Chip is number two to Chip Waldman  Oh  It really is  Chip Waldman is very good  So yeah, that's why we got the  So it's the first step  What do you mean the first step?  Do you hear what?  You're hearing this, right?  This corporate nonsense  The first step 
[00:22:00]  How about you just clean the studio  It'll take an hour  Yeah  The problem wasn't lack of garbage cans  It was people weren't putting things into the garbage  We didn't need more cans  I will be in charge of this studio  And I'm gonna clean up this studio  Yeah  It's a clean studio  That'll be the day  That'll be the day  So the radio wizard signed off on the big giant garbage pails  Radio wizard  Yeah  What?  Why doesn't he throw himself into one of these things? 
[00:22:30]  And we'll wheel him out  And give him a proper burial in a dumpster  Oh no  This is what we deal with  Yeah  The garbage pails  So it came from  Who's the actual person that said  Let's get bigger garbage pills in there  I can ask  And what's the conversation?  The guys are complaining that the studio is dirty in the morning  Oh, we must need giant garbage cans in there  And it wasn't the fact that 
[00:23:00]  It wasn't the fact that it's  Our studio  We never complained that our studio has too much hoarder home style garbage laying around it  We said the studio's cluttered  There's stuff from various, you know, programs and things and just clutter in here  Bringing bigger and more garbage pills in here just clutters it up more  We didn't say we need more room for the garbage that's laying all around the studio 
[00:23:30]  They just missed the point  They're just so stupid  At least the light's back  Yeah  I'm kinda surprised  I am too  I thought that fucking  I'm very surprised by that  I thought that bracket was gonna be empty  Yeah, for years to come  Like the fucking window  The wall came down  Can you open the door for me, please?  No  Oh no  I'll open it  Oh boy, there it goes  He's picking up the giant garbage cans  One of the two  Surprising you lifted  One of the giant garbage cans  And um 
[00:24:00]  And  Ah  Here  That was really loud  Oh, here comes garbage pill number two  It's um  There goes uh  That one got um  Got a body slammed really  Onto the floor  And um  You're gonna have to pay for that one, but  I see  There they are  Look, it's Denny down the hallway  Jesus Christ 
[00:24:30]  So is that a no thank you on the garbage cans?  No  That I think is a  Back to the drawing board  Yeah, yeah, that's uh  Gary doesn't know whose idea it was  I can't wait to bring my son in here  He doesn't know  So he could point at Gary and go  Look what you did  Gary doesn't know whose idea the garbage pills were  I asked whose idea it was  See, this is exactly what I say  Right  No one will know  He says, I don't know  Easy enough to swap them out  I'll let him know  Oh yeah  I hope he's one step ahead of him  Yeah, yeah  They've been swapped out  I'm waiting for you  I hope he just gorilla press slammed them down the hallway 
[00:25:00]  So no problem  But he doesn't know  The one broke too  He did  Yeah, they're gonna make me pay for it  But he doesn't know  Huh?  How does he not know  Whose idea the garbage pills were?  Oh boy  Yeah, you can't know why they're there  But then not  And not know who  Right, right, right  Exactly  How did you get the information that that's why they were  Yeah, yeah  What else happened in the meeting?  I'm trying to remember  Oh 
[00:25:30]  Well, Scott  I try to call him out on the bus tour  And he goes, oh, it's on the calendar for September  Budget signed  Budget signed  Budget signed  I go, but we've been talking about this for over a year  Budget signed  It's not a problem  It's a done deal  Wasn't there something else that happened instead though?  Like there was another project that happened  Like what?  The big dance thing happened instead?  Oh, in Miami  Fall  Fall's bigger than spring  No, he said something about we don't want to compete with summer events  Someone told him that we don't want to compete with summer events 
[00:26:00]  It was more just bullshit  But we wanted to do it in early spring  Because we wouldn't be competing with summer events  Yeah, no  You know what, that's a great point  We would've done it already  If we would've done it when we wanted to do it, we would've done it  It would've been in the history books of the O&A show  Like a month ago  Right  Not summer, it was freezing  It's been freezing  But he said in the meeting  You don't want to fucking compete with summer events  Yes, the lazy, hazy, crazy days of April 
[00:26:30]  And, uh, what else?  I don't even know what else happened there  Well, he got a little paranoid  Why?  Because Opie thought it would be a good idea to bring his camcorder in  And lay it on the arm rest of his chair  Pointing directly at Scott  Now, to Opie's defense, I noticed that the lens cover was closed  It wasn't open, it wasn't recording  But I just placed it in the worst place possible  He looks at me and he goes  Yeah 
[00:27:00]  Are you recording me?  Are you recording this?  And then I had to, like, over the top explain I'm not  And I go, look, you can check for yourself  Oh, no  I swear  And then he, uh, suggested, uh, an event for us  Oh, okay  He knows I'm, uh, sort of a hockey fan  Oh, no, the event  An Islanders fan  Oh, no  Islanders won last night 6-4  Yeah  Over the Penguins  Great game  Did you tweet anything?  Like, yeah, go Islanders  We'll miss you  In the lead  Here they, here they go  I, I did  I did 
[00:27:30]  Oh, you did?  I couldn't help myself  Oh  And it worked out last night  What did I tweet?  I wrote, uh, I just wrote Hell Yeah  Oh, Hell Yeah  I wrote Hell Yeah when, uh, I believe the Islanders tied it up at that point  So I just wrote Hell Yeah  Uh-huh  And people were like, holy shit, keep your fucking mouth shut  How far were, uh, how, how, how, uh, what was their lead at that point?  No, I think that's when they tied it 
[00:28:00]  Oh, oh  Three  Oh  It was a great game  Anyway  So Greenstein has a feeling that I'm an Islanders fan  And he suggested, you know, a big event for us  It's cool  He wants us  Yeah  To broadcast from the Nassau, I swear to God  Ant, back me up  I am right here  He said, uh, he goes, I don't know  How about you guys broadcast from the Nassau Coliseum 
[00:28:30]  And I don't know, like, try to save the Islanders  From what?  From moving  From moving  Is there anybody excited about the move?  Everybody  Everybody  Is excited  I didn't even know what to say at that point  I was nice  I said, well, they actually signed their new lease for Brooklyn  There isn't one Islanders fan  A brand new fucking, you know, arena  That isn't excited about  That isn't excited about the Islanders going to Brooklyn  A new fucking arena  Why would we save that?  There are people bummed 
[00:29:00]  But the time to, quote, try to save the Islanders with a wacky radio bit  That the home of rock and roll should be doing  Not the Opie and Anthony show  You know, a goof event  Would have been when they were trying to figure out if they were going to build a new one  Save the Coliseum!  Save the Coliseum!  Well, how about this?  You go to the new Brooklyn place  And do, like, a fake blockade  Almost like George McGovern blocked  Didn't they block the fucking colleges in the 60s  So students couldn't get in? 
[00:29:30]  That's what we should do with the Islander thing  It wasn't George McGovern, it was George Wallace  Oh, I'm sorry, George Wallace  Geez, poor McGovern  You just made him a racist  Dead, though  Fuck him  I didn't know what to say to that one  Yeah  I got really uncomfortable  I did, too  How out of touch that was  I had an...  All of a sudden, in an instant  The image of an event like that was in my head  Right  I pictured the crackly parking lot of the Nassau Coliseum  No, they made it a little better  Did they?  Yeah, a little better 
[00:30:00]  A couple years ago, they paved it far  Oh, alright, okay  The nice parking lot  Yeah  Us there with, you know, some fucking...  The old Sirius XM van, I don't know  Right  And a smattering of people  Right  And the whole thing being embarrassing because no one was there  And the point of reference for the listeners that are all over the country that don't know what the Nassau Coliseum is  It's a shithole  Exactly, that's all  You guys have only described it as a complete shithole  A shithole  It's the worst arena in hockey  I can't think of one that's worse 
[00:30:30]  Nah, you're right, yeah  Why would people think, listening in Oklahoma, get excited to hear O&A or go into that...  Well, because he knows I'm an Islanders fan  I'm an Islanders fan  Do you think people would fly in from other states to be part of that event?  No, they don't want to save the Islanders  Who cares, right?  It doesn't matter  And then he said something like, yeah, they had a really good year  They had a pretty good year, I think he said  I go, they're still playing, they're in the playoffs  Yeah, I know, Tavares  He just throws a name at me  He loves throwing names out  He just threw a name at me like, no, see, I know  But he didn't know 
[00:31:00]  No  I know, bossy  Right  He goes, yeah, Tavares  That's all he said  You think he just memorized a name?  Yeah  And I wanted to say, you don't know they're in the fucking playoffs, do you?  No, I don't  But now I do  And we'll work on that  Like, here's the deal  Let's say we were able to do some kind of a summer event  A beach party  Much like we did up there in fucking Buffalo  That would rule  But, you know, without maybe getting arrested 
[00:31:30]  I don't know, something like that  Now for that, you could picture people going like  I'm from fucking Chicago  But I am flying there because this is going to be a sick fucking summer drinking chicks party  Now that same guy, you think he's going to be like  Fucking Nassau Coliseum parking lot  Fucking Islanders  Sure, you cook up some dogs  Yeah  Hey, bring me a dog  Even if  Islanders  Uh, no  Even if you had 
[00:32:00]  You don't like that idea, Jimmy?  I can't even put it to words how much I hate it  I wouldn't do it  Fucking great idea  Oh, fuck yeah  You save the Islanders wall in the parking lot  Get some fucking bikes or something  Hey, you take a ride  I'll take a ride  What the fuck?  Even if you had to do like an Islanders event  Then it killed me that I had to be polite  Because they didn't have a microphone in front of me  You know, because then you could tell people  I don't like we're just doing it for the radio  Right  We have to pump shit up for the radio  Exactly  Like this  Yeah, but when you're in his office 
[00:32:30]  You have to be polite about it  Like what?  And make believe it might be a good idea  It might be a good idea  But obviously, you know  We'd rather do something different  I said  That's something somebody that used to be involved in the show  Didn't understand  When you're in that boss's office  See, it's not the show  Whoops  Why wouldn't you attach yourself to like the newness of  It's a new stadium  We're in Brooklyn  Yes  Brooklyn's cool  The stadium's cool  The Islanders are coming here like  Yeah, but  Welcoming the ride 
[00:33:00]  But that's right  The rest of the country  We do talk to the country at this point  Yeah, they wouldn't care  Now, it would have to be something that's very universal  And things that people would like  Everyone loves a good beach event  Summer event  Chicks  You know, that stuff  That you're gonna fucking hop on a plane for  Well, we'll try to  Yeah, we'll try to come up with some kind of event  That's what we finally told them  We're like, look at  We gotta think about it  You know 
[00:33:30]  How about a giant Pop-Tart at Madison Square Garden?  Oh, God  When are we writing the book?  Got it, I got it, I got it  It's time to write the book  Oh, my God  To call out all this nonsense  Oh, Jiminy Cricket  And then  No visual element  That got shut down again  They can't make money at it  Can't make money  And they want to make money as a company  I go, fuck everyone else  I said, make a deal for just us  They don't see the  Yeah, okay, but everybody else  They don't see the upside  I said, fuck everyone else  Make it, you know 
[00:34:00]  If we're a high-profile show  Make a deal for us  They want a good business model  For everybody  That gets money without  Everybody  You know, they don't want to sacrifice content  Without any revenue  So the visual element's gonna take some time still  So the one thing that came out of it is the podcast  And I'll believe it when I see it  How about  Why couldn't they do something where  On their own website  We have cameras in here 
[00:34:30]  And they stream the show on their own website  And you have to  Like if you were listening online  You know, put in your fucking account information  So that now you get people that are already subscribing  So they're getting money from it  It's on their own website  So it's driving traffic to their website  And we now have a visual element  He said something about  Satellites Wi-Fi  Remember that one?  I didn't get it either  You're right  I forgot that one 
[00:35:00]  He has a great way of just  Fucking  You know, just throwing you off the fucking scent  It has nothing to do with the satellites  And how do you  How do you come back from  Satellites Wi-Fi  Satellites Wi-Fi  Yeah, with some technical reason  With the app  He brought  He mentioned the app  And then of course  I don't know that shit  So I can't even argue  The satellite Wi-Fi argument  But could you imagine  You got your phone  And you click on something  An app  And there we are  A fucking  The televised version 
[00:35:30]  Of the program  As we're doing this show  But so  He's  How  People do that all the fucking time  I do it from my basement  Two technologies  Two technologies  Wi-Fi  Satellites  Outer space  Booster rockets  Booster rockets  I do little morning shows on the road  That have that  What?  I do like little regular terrestrial radio shows  Dude, you can fucking click on a website  Of a radio station  And get cameras  Scott and Todd have it  It comes down to this 
[00:36:00]  It was pretty obvious  They can't make money at it  So they don't give a fuck  About our personal happiness  Our personal happiness  Our personal happiness  And a business model  That makes some money  Have to match up  You get it?  But they would make money  That's what I don't understand  I try to argue that  They've not seen the big picture  I said not everything  Is black and white  Where you're making money  At something, you know  Right off the bat  Down the road  You fucking benefit  Right  But you gotta get, you know  Entrenched  You gotta get in there 
[00:36:30]  It's a business model  You do a best of show  I mean, how does Howard pull it off?  Because he knows  Because he controls it  You do a best of show or whatever  And you do it once a week  You get a network  Or a television channel  To show it  There you go  That's how you make fucking money  There you go  Here's how you make money  Whether it's not DirecTV  Maybe you go to somebody else  You go, hey look  We're gonna do a once a week  One hour show  We would like to show it  On your platform  Okay  You sell advertising  During said program  Right 
[00:37:00]  No, he said Mark Cuban  Is interested  But isn't willing to pay for it  Or something like that  Was that one of the things  He said not for air?  Even Mark Cuban doesn't spend a lot  On any of his shows  So there's not uh  Is that one of the things he said not for air?  I don't remember  He said a couple things ago  This isn't for the air  Ooh  I don't know  I didn't purposely say that  Yeah  Was it?  I don't know  I forgot what wasn't for air  And what was  Honestly, so did I  Garbage pills for the air  Okay  Garbage pills  They're still playing out there  New York Islanders idea 
[00:37:30]  For the air?  Yeah, for the air  How could it not be?  Get the people crazy  Get the people crazy  Ah shit  Was that one not for the air?  It doesn't matter  I don't know  I'm sure  But you didn't come up  You didn't say the idea  Yeah, there's no real secret  Mark Cuban certainly  Would love to get involved  He's told us personally  He goes  Well, you know  We should try to figure something out  I said yeah  Let's try to figure something out  They've looked at various places  And talked with various people  About some type of visual element 
[00:38:00]  But it's more a platform-wide thing  And they just haven't heard  The right business model yet  Right  To do that  That was what we heard  I could talk about the conversations  I've had with Mark Cuban  He would love to figure something out  With our show  Yeah  And his, what is it?  Access or something like that?  Access to TV  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's all live stuff  Yeah  He would love to figure something out  And we certainly would too  And we don't give a fuck about the money  As much as like, you know  Raising our profile  Yeah  Out there 
[00:38:30]  And the more people that can see it  The more people that might get the service  That's what it is  It's almost like  When you do a commercial  Instead of a 30-second commercial  It's a one-hour commercial  Yeah  It's  They don't see the value in promoting the platform and the show  They need some type of immediate revenue stream coming in  And so they don't really know that it's a good thing just to put it out there  Well, you know, Blatter did tell them that the show's never sounded better  In the four years he's been working with us 
[00:39:00]  That's true, yes he did  And here, I mean, to summarize, here's the problem  They are very happy with this radio show  It's very successful for SiriusXM  Yes  But we're bored as shit  And just want more for ourselves  And more for, you know, obviously the listeners  And the show in general  And it's not matching up  Yeah  Because right now they're like, oh, we're in the  We're very happy with this show category 
[00:39:30]  They probably have a category of only just a handful of fucking shows  That they know are successful and they're very happy with  And we're in that  Yeah  In that bucket  That corporate bucket  Yeah, they're making some cash  They're happy with that end of it  But, you know  We just want more for ourselves  More for ourselves as far as, you know, creativity goes  The fucking  The fact that the spontaneity factor is gone from, you know, hey, we got a phone call  We got a phone call  This guy and girl want to come up and do this 
[00:40:00]  That's gone  We don't have that  And then we heard, you know  Well, what about the fishbowl?  It's like, no, you don't understand  We can't  We can't get a spur of the moment phone call and go  Now let's move everything into the fishbowl  And fucking, you know, in the middle of the lobby  We're gonna have a fucking guy and a girl fucking or something  Right, right  No, you don't understand  We have to schedule the fishbowl  And then they have to set up the fishbowl for our broadcast  Then, of course, you need security to screen everyone that's coming in 
[00:40:30]  Right  During a certain time  It takes away that element of just  Hey, we got a caller that wants to come in and do this  So that has been, you know, we used to get a lot of that at NEW  And even at XM we got that  But that's not changing anytime soon either  No  Because they're just happy with the show  They're like, look, you know, gave them  They gave us our own studio  I guess that's supposed to be special  Hey 
[00:41:00]  Because other people share studios  And, you know, it's making money for the company  And they checked us off like, good  Alright  We like these guys and they're doing great  Let's look  Yep  In the red, in the black  They were in the black, good  That's it  Okay  Good show  That's a good show  We just want more for ourselves  And by more, you don't even mean money  No, no  Things that will make this show better  Yeah  Yeah, money would always be good  But it's not our  Our number one motivation by any means 
[00:41:30]  I just want to, you know, I want the show available to a lot more people  Yeah  A lot more people  The podcast will certainly help us out though  I think we'll do very good  Yeah  I think we'll do really good numbers on there  Because they'll be able to just download it to their phone very, very easily  Right  Right alongside all the other big podcasts out there  Exactly  So  Uh oh, another load of garbage coming in  Yeah  God damn it  And I mean the guy bringing it  I'm kidding, Kenny  Get it, Kenny  Alright, well 
[00:42:00]  Was that it for the meeting?  Um, there are other things that can't be discussed  What was it?  Oh, Greg  What?  What?  What do I have to be told?  Um  You know, the  The  The um  Why are you not facing me?  I can't  What am I not being told?  I swear to God  I know what he means  What?  No, you don't  Oh  Oh, I got it 
[00:42:30]  I got it  Yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, um.  I think my favorite part was the animation festival.  I couldn't believe it.  That is a good one. 
[00:43:00]  I think the island was broadcasted in my favorite.  My favorite part is, all right, take it easy.  When we shook hands and I was able to fucking leave the office.  I don't know, 45 minutes maybe.  Yeah, about 45.  In the big man's office?  Yeah, you know what was really cool, though?  Where I was sitting, he's got this table in front of me, right?  And there's a, it's like a magic fucking, one of those magic wooden boxes.  It's built very nicely.  And it's got these shelves that pull out from each side of the table. 
[00:43:30]  And it's a nice kind of dovetail joint thing.  And I was able to take my foot, put it underneath, and pull out and push in the little sliding part of the table the whole time.  Yeah.  Was it something to keep yourself occupied?  Yes!  It was cool as fuck.  It slid so smoothly on just the wood.  Nice.  Like, it was built very nice.  Very good.  Very nice, very, a lot of craftsmanship went into it.  I'll end with some positivity.  You completely understand why Scott Greenstein has that gig. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Why?  Because you have to be an amazing bullshit artist.  You have to be able to appease people.  It's a lot of shows to keep happy.  It really is.  There were a lot of promises made in that, false promises made in that office.  Yeah.  But like Ant said, he was throwing names out like, okay, get him on that one, get him on that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I think they're going to try to rearrange the furniture in here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To make a little more room for us in this tiny little spot.  Do you really think they are? 
[00:44:30]  Or do you think?  No.  But he threw a name out and everything.  Oh, get blah, blah, blah.  Steve, Steve, get Kevin Lang on that.  Kevin Lang is big.  Oh, this guy, you're going to love him.  And we never see these people.  It's like watching Shelly from Glengarry, Glengarry.  Grace, book me two tickets.  That's it, yes.  He just comes up with these names.  We leave the office with a lot of promises.  And then one by one, they'll just fall by the wayside.  Oh, yeah.  Like I said to the guys afterwards, I'm like, look, if we got the podcast and that's all that came out of this, 
[00:45:00]  then that's good enough for me.  Because you can't have high expectations that the other shit will be done.  Right.  I say nothing happens with the studio, making it smaller or this area smaller so we have more room in here.  Yeah, the console.  I don't believe we're going to actually broadcast from a bus in the fall.  No, I don't think so.  You don't think so?  No.  But the budget's done.  Signed.  Signed.  It's over.  But the idea is when he says stuff like that about the budget and he throws names out, 
[00:45:30]  at least in that moment, that's the end of the conversation.  Yes.  No, I just said it.  It's done.  That's what it is.  That's what I'm trying to say.  You can't argue if you're saying it's done.  Yes.  You win.  Right.  Like, it's just like, yep, you guys are right.  You win.  Because I did try with it.  But we've been working on this for a year.  He goes, it's done.  It's happening in September.  But we also were told it was done for the spring.  Well, it's done now.  Right.  It's done.  It's done.  Steve.  Tom Douglas is going to fill that one for us.  Get Tom on it. 
[00:46:00]  Tom has done so many great things for this company, and he's going to jump on this.  You're going to love how he handles this.  Who?  Where?  Next time, go in with a company directory and start checking names.  Go, what?  This guy died in 2009.  What the hell is this?  Bill Clay?  It's Bill Clay.  Mel Karma.  Who?  Get Hugh on that.  Call Hugh P on the phone.  Get him on that.  You know what sucks?  I want to throw out my coffee cup, and I can't.  I know.  Because now we have no garbage pails. 
[00:46:30]  We have no garbage pails now.  How about I go grab that blue one down the hall if someone grabbed that?  That's true.  That's all we need is a little blue wastebasket in here.  It needed the money.  A little blue one.  Not stadium garbage pails.  Well, how's it ever going to get clean in here if you don't fill up all possible floor  space with garbage cans?  I don't know.  By the way, I'm a big fan of Plugola.  My razors came in today.  Oh.  That's not Plugola.  DollarShaveClub.com. 
[00:47:00]  See, we're not even doing a live read right now, but I am a fan.  Yeah.  And now that I finally shaved the old beard, I definitely need more razors, and my razors  came in today.  That's not a payola, though.  And I'm not paying for these razors whatsoever.  But they're a sponsor, so that's allowed.  Right.  And razor blade.  Hey, there's the little garbage pail.  Nice.  You hear it?  I heard it.  You hear that?  That's fucking false, right?  What am I supposed to put my stuff in?  That's true.  Yeah, we need another wastebasket.  We need a little small one.  We need the one that's on the side of the... 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Take that.  All right.  All right.  Here's what we're going to do, Mars.  Yes, sir.  See that garbage pail next to the printer?  That's a big one, though.  But it's flatter.  It was here before.  And we do need...  All right.  We need one of a little bit of size here.  It is half.  Because this is...  That's yours, personal garbage pail.  This is the entire thing.  So that goes against the wall.  Look.  See, it's flat.  And it's flush.  And it's half the size of the one we just broke.  Now we take the shitty big pail, and we put it against there so they could use it. 
[00:48:00]  Perfect.  Wait.  Or do you want the blue wastebasket that's coming in now?  No.  I don't think we need that.  You sure?  I don't know.  That's nice and small.  It really is nice, man.  Look at that.  How teeny and tiny.  Hoody-doody-doody.  Try them both out.  Don't we need...  Just try them both out.  All right.  Put that one there.  Okay.  I'll take them both for a little test drive, and we'll see which one I go home with.  What would it take to put you in this garbage pail? 
[00:48:30]  Mars, do you know who ordered the giant garbage pails?  I have no idea.  Ah.  Were they here first thing this morning?  First thing this morning.  So sometime between yesterday and today, garbage pails.  Can I...  Mars.  Yes, sir.  I'm looking at Hispanics a little differently today.  I'm sorry.  Whoa!  I'm sorry, buddy.  But I told you...  I told you my situation.  I'm looking at the Hispanics a little differently today.  You mean respectfully?  He did... 
[00:49:00]  I did tell you guys that Latinos are, you know, they're fucking...  They're sexual deviants.  Why is that?  I don't know.  In general, that's a big fucking bold statement coming from, by the way, the Latino.  Well...  That didn't come from us.  Well, I...  It's called Latin lover.  You get this passion of...  Hold on.  Hold on.  I missed.  We do need the bigger guy.  How about right into the small one?  Ah, see?  I don't know, Mars.  I need to try it out a little more. 
[00:49:30]  What the fuck's going on up there in Cleveland?  No, it's...  And what is wrong with these fucking neighbors?  They called the cops a couple times.  You're reading the shit that...  There was a naked girl in the yard and another girl in chains and the neighbors are...  Some of them did call the cops, but the cops aren't really checking out the situation properly.  Yeah, they called the police.  Holy fuck.  They should have told the cops it was a white girl.  Then they would have bashed the fucking doors.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  I mean, and then at one point, one of the women is on the second floor staring out the 
[00:50:00]  window with a little kid.  And the whole neighborhood, you know, didn't think this guy had a wife, a girlfriend, or  a kid.  So that should have been some suspicion.  And I think that's the end for me today.  Because obviously she's staring out in a way like, wow, I wish I could go outside.  And next thing you know, the dude realizes she's looking out the window and causing suspicion.  So he blocks that window.  Yeah.  And that doesn't get the neighbors a-talking?  The cops were called two years ago for a naked woman in the yard. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  I mean, how many times have this ball fucking dropped?  How many times have the neighbors called you on a naked woman in the yard?  You know what?  They don't call.  But apparently, from speaking to the kids at that birthday party, they look out the window.  Right.  They've watched out the window.  Yeah.  And they're not there against their will at my house, for the most part.  They were at least very good-looking guys.  For the most part.  Huh?  They were good-looking guys, the three brothers. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  I can't even imagine what went on in that house.  Nasty motherfuckers.  What's the five pregnancies about I'm reading about today?  Yeah, they-  Five pregnancies.  There were five pregnancies.  Now, whether that means-  In the house?  Does that mean five kids?  Or does that mean a few abortions?  Probably five abortions or four abortions in one birth.  That's what's in the yard, probably.  Yeah, they were impregnated a total of five times, resulting in the birth of one child.  So, doesn't that-  All right, I got all those.  Tell you that they had to go to some place to get this abortion? 
[00:51:30]  Really, right?  Why don't you say, excuse me?  Yeah.  How?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Because if that's the truth, they wouldn't have buried them in the yard.  Did they bury the abortions in the yard?  There was another girl there, too.  One girl said when she got there in 2002 or 2003, there's another woman there, briefly.  A fourth?  Another woman.  That would be a fourth woman?  That's what one of the girls said.  They're going to find a dead body.  Oh, but you think that's going to turn out to be a house of horrors?  House of horrors for the news?  House of horrors.  Women held in house of horrors. 
[00:52:00]  House of horrors, yes.  I like a good house of horrors on the news.  Well, why don't we do this?  I got a whole fact sheet of the latest on the Cleveland situation.  Yeah.  We'll go down.  There's like 12 new things.  And then we got the Chuck, the Charles Ramsey shit.  Charles Ramsey, hero.  National hero.  There should be a Charles Ramsey day, at least in Cleveland.  Him and his goons.  Him and his goons.  He travels with his goons now.  He has become more of the story than the story.  Of course.  People love him.  He's got an entourage. 
[00:52:30]  And he's dressing a lot nicer already.  And there was an article from a black woman talking about the black witnesses, the black  neighbors of all these various news stories that are over the top and entertain us.  Sure.  And they're on YouTube.  They become viral videos.  They become songs.  And she's very upset that that is completely racist and can't understand why we look at  black people as entertainment as they play the fool. 
[00:53:00]  And we build this up.  It's like, she's an idiot.  Funny, funny, motherfucker.  Sorry that it's all like black people that are on the news and we're cracking up.  I'm sorry.  But why does she blow off the white people that are doing the exact same shit?  Because there's a handful of white people that are also acting like fools.  Because that's what these racist black people do.  They're of the most racists that I've ever seen in that black racists will adhere to  race more than any other race of people. 
[00:53:30]  It's insane.  So this woman that was writing this is a complete racist.  But black people have a thing that we don't like.  White people never get mad at each other.  Big dicks?  What?  Exactly.  Big, delicious.  No, white people never get mad at each other for clowning for black people.  Yeah.  Black people will get mad at each other for clowning for white people.  Yes.  Because that's one dynamic that blacks have with each other that whites don't have with  each other.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I would never accuse you of playing the fool for black.  Yeah.  You just wouldn't.  It's not something that's in our psyche as a race. 
[00:54:00]  You think black people watch, like, could be a crackhead?  Yeah.  And go, like, oh, man.  Yeah, like, what are you doing?  Right.  Let's get Patrice's take on this next.  And, oh, that's right.  He would have a ball with this one.  That would, how fucking great it would be to get his whole Latino angle on it with  the women and that.  And then Charles Ramsey angle on it.  It's just fucking, no one can come in and give us that part of the story. 
[00:54:30]  Sucks.  We just got Mars basically saying that all Latinos.  We got Mars and we got fucking two giant garbage pills.  Yeah.  That's what we get now.  That's what we get now.  That's all we have now.  Which actually, it just amounts to three garbage pills.  We'll do the whole Charles Ramsey thing.  We'll do the latest on the case.  And, I don't know, we'll figure out some other shit, too.  But, meh.  The O.B.N. Anthony Show.  The O.B.N. Anthony Show. 
[00:55:00]  I'm guessing Gary Glitter got busted recently. 
[00:55:30]  Like, is this the anniversary of Gary Glitter's past?  Hey!  Come on, bring this back to the sporting arena.  Hey!  Is this gone?  The sporting events.  Most, most teams got rid of this song.  Why?  Every other song they play, the guy who wrote it did drugs. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, something.  Fucked chicks on the road.  Who cares?  Who cares if he fucked children?  No, but I'm sorry.  That's a good point.  But I'm saying a lot of them did illegal shit like drugs.  I shouldn't say fucked chicks.  Gary Glitter is 69 years old today.  It's his birthday, Jimmy.  Happy birthday, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  Gary Glitter's 69, yeah.  But the 9's a little smaller than the 6.  Yeah.  Hey! 
[00:56:30]  How great is that?  A whole stadium full of people.  Oh, it rules.  Hey!  This one will make a lot of us feel old.  Alex Van Halen.  Yeah.  The big 6-0 today.  Wow.  And Don Rickles still going strong at 87.  Wow.  87 for Don Rickles.  Still performing.  Put it down here, then.  Put it down here.  What is that, Bennett?  Nice champagne.  Come back.  He was so good in the casino. 
[00:57:00]  It was funny.  I saw him on the Tonight Show.  I did a segment before he did Leno once, and I was watching his interview.  And Jay, he said something, and then Jay asked him kind of a similar question.  He said, what are you, dumb?  I just said that.  Fun way to fucking obnoxious.  He says funny shit, man.  Yeah.  What are you, dumb?  All right.  We got Cleveland.  Cleveland.  The big story.  Yeah.  The chicks.  What do we got?  Held captive.  Let me just go down the list as we know it right now.  So, the three women were starved, raped, and then beaten when they pregnant in the basement 
[00:57:30]  dungeon of Cleveland Home.  It was more than they were girls.  One was 14, one was 16.  They weren't even.  Oh, boy.  It's not like they were fucking, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Starved, raped, then beaten when they pregnant in the basement dungeon of Cleveland Home.  Probably when they were pregnant.  It gets cut off on these printers sometimes.  So, when they were pregnant, they, what, had to live in a basement dungeon?  Yeah, the whole time.  They just beat them and raped them.  The brothers did. 
[00:58:00]  What, were they trying to induce a miscarriage or something?  I want, you know what, maybe.  Maybe.  This aerial guy, this fucking animal, knew the girls.  I forget the Spanish girl's name, but he knew her family.  Oh.  So, the last day that this girl was.  DeJesus?  Yeah.  The last day she was seen was with this guy's daughter.  I believe, like, the Ariel Castro's daughter was friends with the, uh, oh, yeah, DeJesus.  And, uh, I think she was walking with the daughter. 
[00:58:30]  Hmm.  And then asked for money to make a phone call.  And, uh, then they just separated.  Like, the Ariel Castro's daughter went one way, and this girl who became the victim went  the other way, and obviously what happened is she probably saw the, this, this, her friend's  father, said, I'll give you a ride.  Right.  And then he just took her.  The old ride.  So, all these years, she was with somebody who she had to know, or she had to know was  her friend's father.  Right.  Jesus.  So, she probably knew she was never getting out because he couldn't let her go. 
[00:59:00]  Damn.  It doesn't make sense that he was able to keep this quiet for ten years.  Amazing.  It doesn't make sense to me.  This many people involved?  Right.  You know?  It's amazing.  The three brothers, no one talked, and the drunken...  And then, and then he's bringing the little kid to the, the local park to play, and...  Yeah, yeah.  It seems like a lot of opportunities to, to...  Yeah, I know, but to raise suspicion.  Because a lot of, the neighbors said, we never saw him with a wife or a girlfriend, but the  next thing you know, he's walking around with a six-year-old, and they said, hey, what's 
[00:59:30]  up with the six-year-old?  And he did say it's my girlfriend's kid.  Yeah.  But no one saw him with a girlfriend.  Yeah.  But in that neighborhood, man, where it's just run down, nobody really paid, you know what I  mean, it's not, it probably is not weird to see a family situation you're not familiar  with.  It's probably not weird to see.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone keeps their yap shut.  Yeah, it's like, whatever.  Oh, you're banging this one that week?  Who cares?  Right, right.  The girls were impregnated a total of five times, resulting in the birth of the one child  who's now, what, six?  Yeah.  One woman had up to three miscarriages. 
[01:00:00]  They were kept chained and taped in separate rooms.  They were reportedly seen naked and on dog leashes in the backyard by a neighbor once,  and cops were called.  Officers dismissed it as a prank.  A prank?  Dismissed it as a prank.  Well, cops did a fucking terrible job with this one.  Man, who the hell is this chick?  Wow.  Wow.  Katie Pavlich.  I know her, actually.  No, you don't.  I do.  Katie Pavlich.  No, you don't.  Nope.  And the smile would give away.  Jimmy.  Another call was reportedly made when neighbors saw three girls crawling on all fours with 
[01:00:30]  nothing but dog leashes around their necks, according to USA Today.  They said police never responded to their call.  Man.  It's a little prank.  They were punked.  A resident said he called police a third time in 2011 when his sister heard pounding  on their window and looked up to see a woman outside with a baby.  When the cops came, they found nothing and left, the neighbor said.  Holy fuck.  Wait, so she got out?  Seems like she got out, was pounding on the neighbor's window. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Right?  Isn't that how that reads?  Perhaps.  When his sister heard pounding on their window, on their window, yeah, and looked up to see  a woman outside with a baby.  Oh, boy.  When the cops came, they found nothing and left, the neighbor said.  Crazy.  Crazy.  So that guy, Ariel, probably came out and said, you know, holy fuck, and grabbed her  just in time and got her back in the house.  Yeah, before the cops showed up.  There's a lot of dropped fucking balls here on this one.  Whoa.  If they were released for any period, it was only done one at a time. 
[01:01:30]  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Released.  What do you mean released?  Where were they released?  Were they released to go out to the store and shit?  Maybe they said, if you fucking say anything, it'll take off or kill the kid or the other  girls or something.  In the last six years, the kid probably became a huge, especially if you released this girl,  Amber.  A problem or a way to keep.  Yeah, because you don't want to do anything that gets a kid killed, especially if it's  the mother.  They might have said, go ahead, go to the store.  We'll watch. 
[01:02:00]  If anybody has come back, we're going to kill everyone in the house and ourselves.  And this is.  I'd take the chance.  Yeah, but, you know, it's easy to say, but who knows?  This is obviously not a death penalty case, right?  No, of course not.  They should just be executed.  What are we doing?  Why are we-  Execute them.  Why are we wasting time?  Well, we're nice, civilized people, aren't we?  Yeah.  One victim may have suffered hearing loss from years of beatings to her head.  He had the older one, and they said she has facial bone damage to her. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, that's-  Wow.  Just fucking sliced their throats.  House of Horrors.  House of Horrors.  Beatings around the head.  Yeah.  So they would just rape these girls, and then just get drunk and beat them.  They just-  Yeah, they should just-  You wish that some cop, and again, you don't want to see a cop throw his career away, but  would just walk in with a pistol and shoot all three of them.  Yeah.  That would be such a-  That's exactly-  Bang!  Bang!  Problem solved.  Bang!  I mean, it's terrible, but-  What's terrible about it? 
[01:03:00]  The whole thing that's happened is just-  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It doesn't make it any easier for the girls, but at least you know that these animals are-  And you know the one guy's daughter cut her own baby's throat.  She's in jail for 25 years.  Ariel Castro's daughter is in jail for slicing her daughter's throat.  And on the street, she slashed the kid's throat a few times because of the baby's father left.  Maybe the baby's father was her fucking father.  Who the hell knows?  No, they know who he is.  They know who he is, yeah.  Well, then fuck me running.  Yeah, I'd love to.  We're sitting, squatting, or standing.  What a wonderful family, huh? 
[01:03:30]  Wonderful.  Again, the guy should-  That's the guy who's helping.  He should have his throat opened up.  Michelle Knight told cops-  She's the one they didn't show her picture at first.  It's out now, yeah.  Yeah, they finally started showing her picture.  Told cops there had been another woman in the house when she first got there in 2002, but she suddenly vanished.  So that one's dead.  Yeah, probably.  So where's that?  Where's that body?  Is it in the backyard?  Are we going to find dead bodies, you think?  House of Horrors.  House of Horrors.  House of Horrors.  I can see the graphic now. 
[01:04:00]  House.  Fucking House of Horrors.  You know, with that scary font.  Scary font.  Yeah, looking like devilish, too.  A lot of red.  Yeah.  House of Horrors.  Yeah, it'll be in a red font.  Yes!  Ariel can't be a red font, right?  No?  No.  The font is a different thing.  I know, but everybody says font when I mean that anyway.  So, yeah.  House of Horrors.  Ariel Castro, who owns the house, obviously, kept up his charade by attending two vigils for the missing girls. 
[01:04:30]  And that probably got him off.  Oh.  You guarantee you he fucked that girl when he got back that night.  Yeah.  Like, that was probably a thing where it would turn him on.  It's like guys who return to the scene of the crime.  He's going there talking about it.  And just like, what do you think happened to them?  I don't know.  Meanwhile, he knows.  Oh, God.  And then he probably went home and just fucked her.  The guy literally should just be hung upside down like an animal and have his throat cut.  That's sadistic.  Ugh.  It's terrible.  A neighbor said he once bumped into Ariel taking a little girl to a playground.  And Castro told him she was his girlfriend's daughter. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, we went over that one.  Another neighbor said she saw a little girl once peering out an attic window at the house.  Most of its other windows were covered with garbage bags.  Creepy.  Ariel Castro, the owner of the house again, and his brothers knew all of their victims' families,  but they were particularly close with the DeJesuses.  DeJesus.  It's not always someone you know, but so many times it is some weird connection to the family, man.  It's so many times it's some weird fucking...  It was with the Long Island case of Katie Beers. 
[01:05:30]  What was the connection with that?  A neighbor.  Yeah.  It was a family friend neighbor thing, and he fucking locked her in a dungeon under his house.  I believe that was classified as a house of horrors.  Yes, that was a house of horrors.  And, yeah, she was held against her will, and, yeah, it was pretty twisted.  She was abused, right?  I'm not sure if he...  I don't know.  Sexually abused her?  Yeah, yeah.  Back in those days, they didn't really get into detail in the news about... 
[01:06:00]  She was in a hole, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was in a dungeon under the house.  And there were TV monitors down there and cameras, so she could...  She literally watched the cops in the house upstairs, and she's going, help me, help me, help me, but they couldn't hear her.  Oh, my God.  And she's watching the cops talking to the guy, and he's laughing with the cops, and she's watching this like, oh, my God.  I'm right here.  And she can't probably hear what's being said.  No.  So for all she knows, this guy knows the cops, and they get you into, especially when you're young. 
[01:06:30]  But once in a while, it's these really crazy stranger abductions.  Yeah.  Like with that Colleen Stan in California, where they eventually let her go out and get a job, and she was so fucking beaten down mentally, she really didn't go home.  She went and visited her family and came back to the kidnappers.  Right.  Like, she was so fucked up.  And she believed that they were in this white slavery ring, that they'd kill her family.  And like, after years and years of just...  For us, we can't comprehend it, but when you're in a fucking coffin under a bed for fucking a year or two years, you start to believe stuff, I guess. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, it's usually something, you know, it's some kind of connection.  What do we covet?  That was random, but some...  Right, yeah, yeah.  What do we do with things we see?  We covet.  We covet.  What do we covet?  What we see every day.  Every day.  Yeah, if there's a kidnapped kid, they literally should go to every one of your neighbor's houses and go top to bottom.  Every single inch of their property should be searched.  I think you could talk to the guy and know that there's something creepy about somebody. 
[01:07:30]  Absolutely.  You know.  Sometimes sociopaths don't fucking indicate, though, man.  Some of these guys are so, like, well, you know, they're so good at...  They don't feel empathy, but they're so good at mimicking empathy.  Bundy?  Yeah.  Bundy was very charismatic.  Yeah.  He was completely normal.  He was involved in some politics in Washington.  And the people that were around him said he was a fantastic guy. 
[01:08:00]  Charming.  The nicest, charming guy.  And even during his trial, women loved this guy.  And they had to keep reminding some of these women that would show up at the court to just look at him that he would...  You are the perfect type that he would kill, you dummy.  His last victim, again, I've said this, but it was a 12-year-old girl, I think, that he smothered in the mud.  Like, that's how he killed her.  He smothered her.  Yeah.  All this fucking, this, you know, Ted Bundy, this handsome devil-may-care. 
[01:08:30]  Devil-may-care.  That guy was a fucking piece of garbage.  Yes.  Right.  They didn't care, though.  Piece of shit murder.  Those women didn't care, though.  No.  I watched something on Rifkin last night.  Oh, God.  At least he looks...  People look at Joel Rifkin, though, and go, wow, he's shit.  Yeah.  Ugly guy with a pickup truck and glasses who liked hookers.  Let me tell you something, though.  At least he looked bad.  They had some interviews with him in prison now.  Just seems like a regular, more darling guy.  It's like, because you never really heard him much back then, and he did look like that worm. 
[01:09:00]  He kind of had the glasses on, and he was looking around like a creep.  But then they had him in prison, and he's like, yeah, you know, those crimes.  He's like, oh, boy.  What are you going to do?  I wake up.  I think about it.  The families and stuff.  He's now regular Joel.  He's regular Joel.  Dude, that's what I was thinking.  Regular Joel.  He's got like a gray goatee and a big, long ponytail, gray hair.  And he's just like, yeah, you know, he goes, it never really hit me until he said after 9-11, 
[01:09:30]  he saw all the pictures that people put up of their missing family and stuff.  And he goes, it really kind of hit me that, you know, these missing family members really make people.  And he's talking about it like, oh, you can let him go.  He's fine.  And that's why I wish we could just execute them all.  Exactly.  Because in the end, prison is like his life.  It's his life.  He's like, ah, this is cool.  And you don't want him to get to a point where he has these revelations.  I don't want a Joel Rifkin that's been rehabilitated or has some type of a newfound peace in his life. 
[01:10:00]  He should have that horrific, murderous, degenerate mind when he's strapped to a fucking electric chair.  Right.  And killed.  Not be given years of support so he can make peace with himself.  Fuck that.  He's living a good life in prison.  Sure.  He knows that life.  In the end, it just becomes your life.  When me, you, or any other normal law-abiding citizen thinks about prison, it horrifies us. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  That's the deterrent for doing bad things.  You don't want to go to prison.  That's understandable.  But people that are in prison, at first, I'm sure, it stinks.  But after years and years, that just becomes your life.  If you're familiar with your surroundings, you know the people, you have a routine.  You're socializing.  Right.  You're chit-chatting.  Right.  You're talking about Homeland.  I'm sure the HBO and some of the joints. 
[01:11:00]  So how is that, all of a sudden, this horrible punishment for murder and rape and things,  when it just, now that's your house.  Right.  These are the people you live with.  Right.  You have TV.  You have food.  You don't have to worry about being cold or this.  You don't have to worry about paying bills.  Paying bills.  Or the economy collapsing or anything.  And you could say it takes away your freedom.  But when you think about it, most people just go from their house to work and back home again.  That's pretty much what they do. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  It's, you know, aside from the ass sex.  But I don't think that's as rampant as people say.  No one will admit to that.  I've talked to a lot of the guys.  Yeah.  So you've got to kill these people.  You've got to kill them.  These pieces of shit, brothers.  He's going to rot in prison for the rest of his life.  Oh, really?  No, he's not.  He's going to be able to play some basketball.  He's going to lift weights.  He's going to watch television.  He's going to socialize.  He's going to play cards.  He's going to fucking. 
[01:12:00]  As long as you're able to dream, it's not that bad.  Right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Fall asleep seven, eight hours a night dreaming about all sorts of cool shit.  It's not like the fucking horrible screw is there with the club hitting you.  Oh, even the guards are fucking pleasant to the convicts now.  Right.  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, right this way.  The guys who really suffer in prison are like guys who didn't do it.  Like, those are the guys that talk.  Right.  Because the horrors of what they're experiencing are so shouldn't be experiencing. 
[01:12:30]  Because it doesn't match up.  It doesn't match up.  It doesn't match up.  Holy fuck, I'm not supposed to be here.  But those other guys are like, yeah, of course I'm supposed to be here.  At least this guy knows I fucking did something terrible for 10 years.  Even whether you agree with what you did or not, you know you did it.  Yeah.  I agree with you, Jimmy.  So, it's going to just get ugly up there in Cleveland.  I'm the contest, by the way, all this prisoner, this fucking, the prisoners are taking care of me.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  They don't give a fuck.  You know why?  Well, some of them do give a fuck, but they don't want more time. 
[01:13:00]  Or they don't want to fuck their own gig up.  Or they can't even get to the guy because they're well protected.  Yeah.  But for the most part, unless you're a psychopath killer, which they probably don't put you in general population,  these guys, of course, it's like anything else, they don't like the guy.  I'm sure they would love to see him hurt.  But why are you going to fuck up your nice fucking cell that you have and your entertainment and stuff  to kill someone and end up in isolation or something?  Right.  You're not going to want to fuck yourself up. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  It's like prison for prisoners.  Now you're living your life in prison.  You don't want to go to prison prison, so you toe the line.  Stop saying prison.  Prison, prison, prison.  Prison.  So now we've got Ariel's son.  Ariel, of course, the homeowner.  The little mermaid?  The homeowner up there in Cleveland.  And we've heard about his son, Anthony Castro.  He's the one who wrote that article about the missing.  Oh, right.  And he gave an interview to the UK's mail online. 
[01:14:00]  So this is brand new shit coming in.  Huh?  Yeah.  I'm saying we should try to get him on.  Yeah, we should absolutely try to get him on.  We're trying to get all these guys on.  We're trying to get Charles Ramsey on.  He says his father padlocked doors leading to the basement, his attic, and his garage,  and never allowed family inside.  Would you blow the whistle on your own family member?  Fuck yeah.  So would I.  But I think that was so normal for this guy.  That was just the way he lived.  Like, I think that you got, because the guy was a piece of garbage who I think used to 
[01:14:30]  beat the, or at least it was said that he beat the wife.  So you probably got used to this guy being who he was.  And it didn't strike you as odd that things were locked, because they were probably always  locked.  What is this a picture of?  That's a photo of him and a girlfriend in 2001, Ariel.  Right.  He loves crackers.  I like crackers.  Yeah, I mean, who doesn't like the saltine?  What else is on the top of his, he loves the saltine.  Looks like we got some Ritz bits.  All right.  I like a good Ritz bits every once in a while.  Is there some Goya products? 
[01:15:00]  I don't see any Goya.  Is there some of that guavo fucking juice?  I see Cheerios.  I see beans.  That's Cheerios.  So this is a photo of him in 2001, and behind him is a padlocked door to the basement.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  In 2001, one of the girls had already been missing for a year.  Dora Horace.  No, none of these three were missing.  Yeah, that's funny.  No, there's another girl.  These girls were one of the others.  They're going to find dead bodies, man.  I'm telling you right now.  There's Anthony, who's the guy. 
[01:15:30]  Hey.  Yeah, read through this, Jimmy.  Anthony is Ariel's son there, the owner of the house.  Oh, he said his father passed.  His father asked him just weeks ago if he thought the kidnapping of Amanda Berry would  ever be solved, which Anthony thought was a weird thing to ask.  He just brought it up to his son.  And this guy apparently, allegedly, nearly beat his wife to death in 93 while she was  recovering from brain surgery.  And she did move out of the house in 96, along with the three sisters of this kid, I guess  the three daughters. 
[01:16:00]  And Anthony does not believe the girls were kept at Ariel's house for the entire 10 years.  No, I do.  And suspects that his uncle might have been involved in keeping them at his house at times.  Uncle Tony?  Oh.  So they may have transported them back and forth.  So, um, I'm guessing it's either that or the son doesn't want to face the horrible realization  that, fuck, I may have been in that house while they were there and not knowing.  No, he's completely aware.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, I'm saying the entire interview.  Yeah.  Like, he's completely aware.  So maybe that's a horrible, maybe he's hoping that that's what the case is so he wasn't in 
[01:16:30]  the house with him and not knowing.  Like, he's probably, that's devastating to think that you were there.  Like, you're trying to just hope it's something else.  He says he was never in the house for more than 20 minutes and hasn't been in there for  years.  Because he wouldn't, uh, Ariel wouldn't let family in the house.  Well, yeah, you don't want to hear any fucking.  Yeah, I mean, he's kind of hiding stuff, so.  Excuse me.  Jesus.  Yellow.  It is.  And they said that the girls, I mean, it'll all come out.  There'll be a movie and this will be a book that I think, you know. 
[01:17:00]  I can see the title.  House of Horrors.  House of Horrors.  You're going with that, huh?  I'm so going with it.  Or it'll be something else.  That's already been taken.  Damn it.  Decades.  Oh, it's an emergency alert on everyone's phone.  Flash flood warning.  This area till 9.15 a.m.  Avoid flood areas.  Check local media.  Did all of our phones just go on?  How the fuck are we on?  I don't mind that they got that.  Mine did not go on.  Isn't that insane?  But how can it tell us? 
[01:17:30]  Do you have, like, the weather channel to push notifications?  No, no.  I don't believe in push notifications.  I have, I was having such a great conversation with a lovely young lady last night about cell phones and their abilities and what they've done to society and the sheer amount of knowledge and potential that are in these little fucking things that you carry around with you.  And that right there is just another amazing thing. 
[01:18:00]  Hey, bop, bop.  There's an alert.  No matter where the fuck you are, you're getting, like, emergency alerts.  It's amazing.  Future Jimmy has some thoughts, too.  Future Jimmy.  Ooh.  We talked about Google Glass last night on Red Eye.  Ooh.  And everyone's, oh, I love it now.  Everyone's upset about their fucking privacy.  Oh, they're, they're, they're, they're, people are going to be filming everything.  What about my privacy?  Fuck you.  Go fuck yourselves.  Where were, again, where were you when fucking, uh, Tiger Woods or any of these guys' fucking privacy was being violated? 
[01:18:30]  Where were all you fucking cocksucker privacy advocates when Alec Baldwin, his private message to his daughter was being played?  Where were you?  You know what people think?  If you remember in King of Comedy, when Rupert Pupkin goes to, uh, Jerry Lewis, and he's just like, well, you know, that's your life.  You got, I guess you just got to deal with it.  Yeah.  They look at celebrities in, in that, well, you gave up your private life to, because you got, uh, money and you're, you're, you're famous and stuff. 
[01:19:00]  Well, sorry.  But then you turn that around on them.  Hey, hey.  Whoa.  My privacy.  What do you mean?  I got no, I don't want to be seen by, I don't want to, but what about me?  Hey, I don't want to, but what about, take it, shitheads.  It's a fucking byproduct of your nosiness and your morbid voyeurism and you're getting, and I don't mind it because I acknowledge I'm nosy.  Yes.  I acknowledge it.  We all are.  You're a busy body.  Celebrity's one thing in, in, in, in public. 
[01:19:30]  Like, I get why Gisele Bundchen is going to have her photo taken at the beach.  I, I mean, that's something celebrities should shut the fuck up about.  But when it comes to.  And a lot of those shots are set up.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I, I, I think she could find a beach where no one's going to take her picture if she really wanted to.  And I'm sure she does just that.  That's why those pictures aren't out there.  But that stuff, I mean, like, I kind of understand people's fascination with a celebrity in public and shit or, but when it comes to, uh, the privacy of Tiger's text messages and how there was no outcry against the media, there was no outcry for this stuff. 
[01:20:00]  So, you know, that's not, that has nothing to do with being a celebrity.  That's just a guy talking privately with somebody and not, nobody fucking tried to say we shouldn't judge.  We shouldn't, everyone gobbled it up.  Greedy cocks.  Gobbled it up.  Yes.  Now you get, and by the way, Google Glass, keep banning them.  Stupid bars.  Because, you know, two years from now it's going to be Google contact lenses.  And you won't even know who has them in.  They're banning the glasses and bars?  A couple bars, yeah.  And, of course, Vegas, because they want to keep the odds. 
[01:20:30]  Vegas.  A lot of the bars have cameras that you can check out online now.  Vegas doesn't allow fucking cameras in anything.  Now they can do it.  But when it's contact lenses or when it's something that goes over regular glasses that you can't tell that becomes indecipherable or, or in, uh, what's the word you can't?  Uh, I bet there'll be some type of scanner you have to look into before you're allowed in the casino or something, something like that.  Um, scanners.  Yeah.  Scanners.  I don't know.  That Google Glass thing looks pretty silly. 
[01:21:00]  Anyway, if you ask me.  They're going to figure it out.  Oh, they'll figure it out.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  Everything we do now.  You're not going to be able to hold back that technology, obviously.  And it's all being uploaded and online.  I said that we were going to.  It's all garbage.  Who's going to watch half that shit?  But it will be.  99.9% of that shit no one will ever watch.  We're all going to know every aspect of each other's life.  I've told you.  Eventually, we'll start to be judged for private thoughts.  This is the beginning.  Okay.  We see each other's everything.  But now picture Google Glass a year from now.  Two years.  Three years.  I see everything after the open time. 
[01:21:30]  All this shit that we're doing in our private lives, walking down the hall.  Wow.  All of a sudden, 10% of life is uploaded.  10% of life.  And then all of a sudden, you fast forward that technology where the fucking everything shrinks and the technology is more affordable.  22% of life is uploaded and online and now recordable.  Go 30 years from now.  50 years from now.  80, 90% of life is uploaded.  And now we can move things on a computer screen with our eyes.  In the year 25, 25. 
[01:22:00]  If that is still alive.  We're obviously moving toward where your whole life will be online.  And recordable.  You'll be long gone, but like, oh, let me check out this guy's life.  Live on.  Which would be interesting to family members when you could.  Right now, what?  We get one lousy, tiny little black and white picture of our ancestors.  But eventually, you'll be able to go, oh, I want to see what their life is about.  Imagine fucking, you get a, you get a photo bombing of like Lincoln in the background with his hat.  Like if they had that much, the access to cameras that we do now. 
[01:22:30]  Because now every, every picture used to be precious.  Right.  You take a picture with your fucking Kodak Instamatic app.  You have 24 pictures on the roll of film.  You didn't know how it looked.  So that you weren't just going, dude.  You know, fucking up everyone's shit.  I went, I went old school for my kid's party.  We had a Polaroid.  Polaroid.  So you take a picture, then you put it in a little book, say a little something, something.  Nice.  But I know exactly what you're talking about.  It was like, it was so, you didn't, I didn't want to push that button.  Yeah.  Because I only had, what, 20 per fucking roll. 
[01:23:00]  Before I had to reload the camera.  I was also talking last night about just meeting people.  Now, the fucking internet and Facebook and Twitter and everything makes it very easy to be very brave to meet people.  Because you no longer need that face-to-face contact.  You have so much information on the person before you ever even have to type hey to them.  And I was almost equating it to years ago, if you were to walk into a bar and you wanted to meet a girl. 
[01:23:30]  And there's a bunch of girls sitting at the bar and all of them have photo albums in front of them.  And their diary is laid out.  And their political and religious affiliation is up there.  And what they do for a living.  And you just browse.  Before you say it, you walk up to them.  Oh, look at these pictures.  Here's their friends.  Here's a diary.  Oh, boy, a little bit of baggage there.  But we never had what we have now as far as meeting people.  You needed face-to-face.  You had to break the ice. 
[01:24:00]  You had to fucking, like, come up with something to say that would hold her interest.  But in both instances, if you're drunk, you really don't care about what's in the diary.  You're just like, she's hot.  And then what you would do is look through all her pictures on the bar and all the political affiliation.  Then you would just pull your cock out and show her.  Right.  Hey, what do you think?  Exactly.  You just use it for ammunition.  Yeah.  You talk to her first.  You go, hey, how are you?  Lol.  Lol.  Lol.  What?  Raffle.  Raffle.  All right, here's my cock.  I was thinking about Tom Popper, everyone. 
[01:24:30]  Good morning, everybody.  Imagine if there had been Twitter around during, like, the pre-Civil War.  Oh, boy.  Would you have ever had some, like, if people were tweeting, like, yo, I'm on this plantation.  This guy is whipping people mad crazy.  Seriously, there would have been a light shined on any evil.  Anything.  Everything gets exposed now.  But I was also thinking that the availability of information and what's going on with causes and tragedy. 
[01:25:00]  Look, you look at Syria.  There's a lot of people dying over there.  People know about it.  They're kind of concerned.  But I think because there's so many things going on and so many causes and we're exposed to so much bad behavior on a global level now that it doesn't affect us like it used to.  When you look at a cause like No Nukes years ago, you'd get a shitload of people that got together because the next cause wasn't the next day or the next hour. 
[01:25:30]  This was your cause for a long time.  You cultivated it.  You built relationships with people.  And a huge crowd would go to a nuclear power plant or cuff themselves to a silo, a missile silo.  Now you get involved with a thing.  All right, Kony.  Kony, this guy.  The next day, it's like, ah, muscular dystrophy.  Oh, we got to get rid of this.  You got two days, basically.  Right.  Right.  You got two days for people to see your video before they move on to the next video. 
[01:26:00]  Yes.  You got two days to fucking give money to this organization because we're going to move on to the other thing.  There's no more dedication to a cause.  How about the news?  There's no passion to actually dedicate a part of your life to a cause anymore.  Our attention span is so small.  Yeah, gone.  Do you guys remember when we all cared about Boston?  Bro, Boston Strong.  Remember?  What happened?  Boston Strong and all that?  Yes.  Oh, they shipped those news crews right to Cleveland, didn't they?  Yeah.  It's all about Cleveland now.  It's Cleveland Strong now. 
[01:26:30]  Cleveland Stronger.  Cleveland Strong.  But we're getting used to it.  See, don't forget.  We're getting used to the information.  It's like we didn't have this.  As time goes on and we become adapted to it and that becomes our lives.  It's affecting our passion level, though.  No, it's affecting our passion level in that we're exposed to too much shit.  I think back, being a kid and stuff, and you think about seeing a person being killed on film.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't.  No.  You didn't see it. 
[01:27:00]  There was no way to see it.  Right.  You heard this fucking hazy rumor of snuff films and things.  Now, two clicks, you're watching people die, literally dying.  So it does something.  It takes away this mystique and terror of death and fucking horrible things.  You become a little numb to it.  Totally desensitized.  And that goes not only with that aspect of it, but everything.  A cause, relationships, fucking one-on-one conversations aren't important anymore. 
[01:27:30]  But look at...  You're right.  But look at the way it's...  Look what's happening.  As a planet, we're becoming, in a really weird way...  People say pussification in a way they're right, but we're becoming...  We're moving to a gentler way of being as people.  I don't know.  We absolutely are.  Look at the way children are being raised now.  And again, I hate political correctness, and I hate all this hyphenating and fruity stuff.  But look at the way it's happening. 
[01:28:00]  All of these things that were considered abusive are no longer tolerated.  All of this language that was considered abusive.  We're going towards this.  We're seeing everything, but we're also softening.  And I'm not even saying it's necessarily a bad thing.  As a species, we are fucking becoming more and more less violent.  A phoniness to that, in that we're so exposed and open to each other through the internet  and every way to transmit information, that we try to put up a front now that we're not 
[01:28:30]  these bad people and we don't do these bad things.  But I think people are just as fucking uncivilized and animalistic.  They are, but the light does get shined on it.  I mean, even though the Arabic Spring changing these dictators, and it's opened up and made  things a mess in their own way, but now a light has shined on that.  Now, like in Tahrir Square, you have all these wraiths happening, and that's not...  It used to be nobody knew about this stuff.  Right. 
[01:29:00]  It would just happen.  And now the big light has shined on it, and things are...  There's fewer wars now than ever before.  There's definitely...  The problem, though, but to what you're saying, is the attention span shrinking, you no longer  digest stories.  You don't take the time to understand, all right, what is happening in Egypt?  You just hear a little blip, someone got raped, or boop, or there were cool protests, but  you don't sit and digest a story over years.  I mean, these are global events, and we treat them like sound bites. 
[01:29:30]  You don't need to digest them as much, only because the information is getting to you  so much faster.  It used to be you read the paper, or Newsweek, or whatever, like, what is Newsweek saying?  It's like, what happened this week?  But they're complex, but it doesn't make the stories any less complex, and we're not really...  When you just had, you know, the 5 o'clock news, it wasn't a fucking, the 5 o'clock local  news, the 6 o'clock national news, and then you'd have newspapers, you couldn't, at 9.15 
[01:30:00]  a.m., there's no fucking way you knew what was going on in the world.  No.  You had to wait.  And shit was happening!  And that's just like it happens now, shit was happening.  It's better, obviously.  But, you were more apt to get involved in the story, and get more into it, and be more  informed.  Right.  Now we're very happy with 140 characters from some fucking guy you don't even know that  said, hey, did you hear what happened?  Right.  And now that's all you know about the story. 
[01:30:30]  Some guy used 140 fucking letters to tell you a news story, and that's all you...  I was telling you this morning, our newspapers have the 911 call from Amanda Barry.  Yeah, yeah.  Meanwhile, it's old news already.  Or Barry, right?  Right.  It's old news, but they have the transcript of the 911 call in today's paper.  It's like, who the fuck?  Right.  Everyone's heard it.  Who the fuck hasn't...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, who hasn't heard that?  But to say that, like, when you look at, like, the way we are, in our lifetimes, it went  from where if you saw a kid slapped in the face by his parent when we were a kid... 
[01:31:00]  Right.  It wouldn't be...  You said good parenting.  I still do.  But I mean, in our lifetimes, to prove that it's not just us covering up, that went from something  you didn't even notice, to becoming jarring.  If you saw a parent, like, you know, Tom, you saw a parent call off and crack their kid  in the face, even if the kid was shitty or behaving terribly, it was still going, fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, and this is only in the existence, this little space of us being from fucking whatever, 
[01:31:30]  you know, little kids in our mid-30s that we are.  28.  Yeah.  That has become a jarring image.  So we are desensitized to the stuff we see on video, but I find myself more empathetic  to that stuff.  Like, I really, I panic more about car accidents now, or, like, I think about being burned.  I look at that limo and that fucking, those people being burned, and I've watched people  being burned alive, and it's so upsetting to think about.  I care a lot more than I ever would have.  I don't know how good it is to watch that at such a level. 
[01:32:00]  Maybe it's not good, but the limo driver is an asshole.  What happened with that?  Are we going to talk about the limo driver?  He's all over the news, like, he's some kind of, like, fucking celebrity now, and they're  starting to talk to the people that got out of the limo, and they were begging the guy  to just fucking, you know, stop the car.  Of course he was driving with his car on fire.  What the fuck?  Fucking Joey Chitwood.  What is he driving?  Yeah, yeah.  He didn't stop because he didn't know, he didn't, he didn't know what they even wanted. 
[01:32:30]  They're banging on the partition.  Screaming.  Ah, fire, fire.  The little ones got through the little partition into the front seat.  Apparently the doors couldn't open, or the fire was too close to the back doors.  In a limo, you don't have doors in the back and the front, for the most part.  Right.  You know, you got the driver's door up there, but then in the back area, you just have the  two in the back.  That's engulfed in flames, so they had to climb through.  As he's driving?  There were like 10 people in there.  Yeah, it was a flaming limo flying down the highway for a while.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Good Lord.  But they, it's coming out, they all were begging him to do something, pull over.  And he didn't.  I mean, who knows?  The stuff that those guys must hear, though.  You know what I mean?  You don't hear pull over, the car's on fire.  Yeah, right.  And also, there's got to be a feverish pitch to that.  It's not like...  It's a terrible story.  One of the ladies that made it out alive, there was a heartbreaking interview on CNN.  If we could get it.  It's brutal.  Do they know what started the fire? 
[01:33:30]  I'm going to guess gas cans or something in the trunk, but do they know what it was?  It's probably an electrical problem.  The limos have a lot of fucking shit wired in there, and if it's not done properly, yeah,  you get shorts.  Yeah.  You know, they got all those fucking electron lights and fucking...  Right, trying to make...  ...video and audio equipment, you know.  Yeah, that's worth losing your life over.  So, you know, so you could look at the star-lit roof of the fucking limo.  It's magical.  But I mean, how did it become such a fire?  So, like, wouldn't they have smelled smoke?  Like, it had to be something. 
[01:34:00]  It had to be a gas can or something and a spark hitting it.  Or alcohol.  You know, they've got all that booze back there.  I think it's just shit burning.  And the way he was driving as it was on fire, the second you then stop the vehicle...  Right.  Right.  It just seems like he could have done more.  I don't know.  We should break.  We've got to talk about Mother's Day.  Mother's Day is weekend.  We've got a lot of live reads, so we do have to break.  Tom Papa is here.  I know you've got the big Philly gig this weekend, right?  Yeah, the night before Mother's Day. 
[01:34:30]  At the Kimmel Center?  Yes, sir.  Beautiful theater.  There's still some tickets available.  And the Pearlman Theater in Philadelphia.  Oh, and I have a cop drama that I'm working on that the guys are going to be included in.  Oh, really?  But I'm starring as the cop, of course.  What is the gist of this?  He's just a cop who, you know, he's just on the job and he does what he does.  And the slug line is going to be, he's tough as nails with a heart of gold. 
[01:35:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's talk about Charles Ramsey.  Yes, for Mother's Day, Charles Ramsey, Charles Ramsey, for Mother's Day.  Oh, shit, I thought it was.  What happened?  We took care of the house of horror on the last break, and now we're going to have a little fun with the Cleveland situation.  Thanks to Charles Ramsey.  Tom Papa, you like the Charles Ramsey?  Uh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:35:30]  He's quite the character.  Yeah.  He is quite the character.  And he's hanging with the goon squad.  Does he call it the goon squad or his goons?  Sounds like what Anthony calls it.  Yeah, well, it's a little different.  Yes.  A little bit of a pick up.  Oh, God.  We got Charles Ramsey talking to Anderson Cooper last night.  Anderson Cooper?  He's dreamy.  Yes.  And, uh, Charles Ramsey?  Piercing blue eyes.  Charles Ramsey said some fun stuff that we like to listen to. 
[01:36:00]  Now, we've noticed yesterday when he first hit the news, uh, you know, he's the heroic Cleveland citizen that kicked in the door and freed these poor damsels in distress.  A Superman of sorts.  Yes, yes.  He's not a Superman.  He was in the right place at the right time.  Of course he was.  With the screaming and the clawing at a door, I think anyone would have had to jump into action.  We learned that.  He didn't have any superpowers.  We learned yesterday that, uh, in his initial interview, that he didn't know who the girl was, didn't know that she was the kidnapped girl from ten years ago. 
[01:36:30]  He didn't know anything was happening in the house because the guy was completely normal.  He had barbecued with him and had ribs with him and stuff like that.  Um, and, uh, he just didn't know anything was going on.  That was at the first interview.  By the last interview of yesterday, he knew exactly who the girl was.  She was a kidnapped girl.  He, he bolted into action and kicked the door down like a superhero.  And he sensed that she was there.  He sensed, yeah, his spidey senses.  And he knew a year ago and told one of his friends, something's going on in that house. 
[01:37:00]  His story changed like a witness on First 48.  But do you understand what we're doing here?  We're breaking them down already.  Of course we are.  We can't allow this to be a cool fucking story.  We've got to break them down.  He's starting to fib a bit, Ophie.  And as we remember yesterday also, when he was giving the first interview and the police  siren sounded in the background, his eyes opened up and his head spun around like, like he  didn't like the sound of a cop being that close to him. 
[01:37:30]  I predict Watson warrants and this hero will be in lockup shortly.  I decided to isolate the police siren.  I put it up on my channel.  Oh, you did.  I had to.  I was like, what the fuck?  He goes, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  I think he's a new superhero for a new age.  Yeah.  And, you know, I don't think he wanted to give away his secrets in the beginning.  And then he realized, well, the attention's too great.  I'm going to have to give up some of my superhero techniques.  Ah, interesting angle on that one. 
[01:38:00]  Well, when you hear him talk, how can you not think superhero?  Obviously, his kryptonite is hair conditioner.  And police siren.  Kills him instantly.  And the police siren.  And the toothbrush.  Steers clear.  And the toothbrush.  He steers clear of these things that might deter him from his hero.  And who does he look like?  There's a few out there right now.  Everybody.  See, because.  Yeah.  Hide your wife.  Looks like an Eddie Murphy character. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, from Coming to America.  Maybe Coming to America.  The barber from Coming to America, yes.  Is that who it is?  Is that the other one coming in?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The barber from Coming to America?  Yes.  Yes.  There he is.  All right.  There's Charles Ramsey in Coming to America.  And Charles Ramsey, I noticed on Twitter yesterday, McDonald's, the McDonald's Corporation.  Their official Twitter, and it did have the check mark, and it was really McDonald's, said that they were honoring him. 
[01:39:00]  This is an amazing thing.  His heroics.  Their hearts go out to the girls that were kidnapped.  Sure.  But they also said, Charles.  There it is.  We salute the.  Whoa, where did it go?  Okay.  We salute the courage of Ohio kidnapped victims and respected.  Could you read it from there?  I'm sorry.  It's a little too far away.  They're victims and respect their privacy.  Way to go, Charles Ramsey.  We'll be in touch.  We'll be in touch.  You know what that means?  Resume.  They're ready to give him a shitload of Big Macs, but they want to make sure he doesn't 
[01:39:30]  have any fucking problems.  Well, here's another thing.  They're looking into his background to make sure before they fucking back up the Big Mac  truck.  They saw the initial interview where he's like, you know, he's not cursing or anything.  Did they hear his 911 call?  Well, because that was a lot different than his interviews.  That's the real Charles Ramsey.  That's where he was holding back.  The real Charles Ramsey.  I was like, I don't know who up in that fucking bitch.  Can we play the 911 call?  The 911 call is great.  Do we have it in Iraq?  Is great.  I haven't heard it.  No, we played it online. 
[01:40:00]  It's fan-fucking-tastic.  Tom Popp, have you heard the note?  No, I have not.  You haven't heard the uncensored one?  No.  It's going to be censored on CBS.  Where did we find it yesterday?  I think we have it on our Facebook if you want to play it off there.  Yeah, just play it.  Yeah, play it over Facebook.  That's a good idea.  I don't go to CBS's feed.  No, because you know they're going to beep out all the curses.  Oh, they stink.  They suck, even though they're part of the internet.  They're full of turkey.  But they have to have the same rules for their internet fucking site?  Yeah, just go to the Facebook page.  There it is, right?  Okay, listen to this, Tom Popp. 
[01:40:30]  Awesome.  This is the real Charles Ramsey.  What you're about to hear is a 911 call placed by hero Charles Ramsey  after he found Amanda Barry, a woman who had been kidnapped for the past decade.  This man saved her life.  5, 52 p.m., 34 seconds, May, 6, 2, 0, 1, 3.  Cleveland 911, police, ambulance to fire.  Yeah, hey, bro.  I'm at 2207 Seymour, West 25th.  Hey, check this out.  I just came from the cameras, right?  So I'm on my porch eating my little food, right? 
[01:41:00]  This broad is trying to work out the fucking house next door to me.  So there's a bunch of people on the street right now and shit.  So we're like, well, what's wrong with you, what's the problem?  She's like, this motherfucker been getting at me and my daughter and we've been in this bitch.  She said her name is Linda Barry or some shit.  I don't know who the fuck that is.  I just love you, bro.  Sir, sir, sir.  Sir, you have to calm down and slow down.  Sir, sir.  You have to calm down and slow down.  Oh, Seymour.  Is she still in the street or where does she go?  Yeah, I'm looking at it. 
[01:41:30]  She's right now.  She's calling y'all.  She on another phone.  Is she black, white or Hispanic?  She white, but the baby look Hispanic.  Okay, what is she wearing?  White tank top, light blue sweatpants.  Like a white beater.  Do you know the address next door that she said she was in?  Yeah, 2207.  I'm looking at it.  Okay, I thought that was your address.  I'm smarter than that, bro.  I'm telling you where the crime would.  Do you want to leave your name and number?  Charles Ramsey, R-E-M-S-B-Y. 
[01:42:00]  What's the phone number?  So you got the phone number there, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, we already dumped out the phone number?  Are the people she said it did this, do you know they still in the house?  I don't have a fucking clue, bro.  I just said it was McDonald's.  I said it was McDonald's.  Can you beg her if she needs an ambulance?  You need an ambulance?  Or what?  She needs everything.  She's in a panic, bro.  I bet she's been kidnapped, so put yourself in her shoes.  We'll send the police out. 
[01:42:30]  Thank you.  Yeah, you're good.  That's my favorite part.  She needs everything.  She needs everything.  She needs everything.  Send every motherfucker.  She needs police, she needs helicopters, she needs a McDonald's.  Yeah, fucking McDonald's.  That's the real Charles Ramsey, not the guy.  How do you handle that if you're McDonald's?  Damn, damn, damn, there's a bitch at the door.  I don't know that whore.  A lot of free press from McDonald's.  Oh, McDonald's.  McDonald's.  How do you handle that if you're in a board meeting at McDonald's? 
[01:43:00]  How do we grasp on to this gentleman and use him to our best advantage?  I don't want to be a buzzkill here, but maybe he's not the kind.  He's a little too ghetto for what we're trying to portray.  Now, see, McDonald's is all about diversity.  I know we want an urban audience, but...  I think this is a perfect way to dive into the diverse consumer base that we perhaps are missing.  Yes, let's go with this Charles Ramsey. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, God.  We're going to use him a lot for our...  Oh, boy.  He could be the new Rodney Allen Rippey for us.  Oh, God.  You think there's a commercial in his future?  Oh, yeah.  There's no way.  The Ramsey shuffle.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're going to give him free fucking Big Macs for life, and that's it.  Here's your free Big Macs for life card.  Oh, yeah.  Keep it down.  Good luck with your life there.  They'll have him like fucking...  They'll have him sitting at McDonald's.  He'll be like, ah! 
[01:44:00]  He'll take the Big Mac.  He'll put it up to his mouth.  Ah, get ready to bite, and then you'll see the bathroom door at McDonald's.  Help!  I'm trapped in here!  Oh, man!  And he'll put the down, kick the door in.  You deserve a break today.  Well, no, it'll be something innocent.  Like, he'll be going to eat the thing, and it'll be like, you know, help, help!  And he'll put it down and run, but it'll just be a girl who spilled her milkshake.  Oh.  And it'll be like, something like, oh!  It'll be like a fun ending, like it wasn't that bad. 
[01:44:30]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, you can't be a hero every day.  Yeah.  The old habits die hard.  I'm loving it.  I just want to help.  I'll have a Big Mac with everything.  I'm going to kidnap these McNuggets and store them in the basement of my stomach.  So he got to Charles Ramsey on the Anderson Cooper last night on CNN.  Yeah, he did Anderson Cooper's show. 
[01:45:00]  We're checking out all the interviews and bringing the best clubs to you.  Here's Charles telling Anderson what happened.  So yesterday, what happened?  Uh-oh.  You're going to love this.  I'm not going to tell it all.  Well, around 3 o'clock, I was on my porch, and the mailman put his mail in my mail.  So I looked at him and was like, oh, I got to get Ariel on his mail when he come home.  A couple minutes later, he pulled up. 
[01:45:30]  He checked the mailbox, grabbed his mail.  Before he went in the house, I said, Ariel, here go your mail.  And we just had the same conversation when I handed him the mail.  He said, they can't get it right.  I said, nope, damn postal service.  That's it.  He left.  I jumped on my bike, went to McDonald's.  He mentions McDonald's again.  I know.  He's not a dumb guy.  He knows someone's paying attention.  I went to McDonald's.  Jesus.  Imagine the greatest would be if the fucking girls come out and they go, 
[01:46:00]  and all we ate for 10 years was McDonald's.  McDonald's gets a black eye.  Those murderers loved McDonald's.  Those fucking kidnapping kids.  They would always eat McDonald's after second year.  Give them complete black eye to McDonald's.  I love McDonald's.  Came back home.  I'm in my house.  Enjoying McDonald's.  But I'm in the living room.  And I'm right by the front door because I'm looking out the front door.  Oh, he's too much detail, guy.  And man, this girl screamed like a car had hit a kid, 
[01:46:30]  which made me, you know, you stop eating.  You know, what the hell was that?  So when I got up, I saw this, my neighbor across the street.  He run across the street.  And I'm like, well, I'm thinking, well, where are you going?  Because ain't nobody next door because I just saw Ariel leave.  And I know ain't nobody over there.  Heard that girl scream and saw him run across the street.  And I went outside and wondered what he was doing.  And a man would say, I'm stuck in here.  Help get me out.  So he either don't know English that well or panic. 
[01:47:00]  But he just looked at me and was like, he's a girl.  And that's all he did.  So here I come with my, you know, eating Big Mac.  And she's like, I've been trapped in here.  And he won't let me out.  It's me and my baby.  And I say, well, he ain't got to talk no more.  Come on.  And I'm trying to get the door open.  He can't.  I used some of the grease from the French fries to lubricate the lock.  That's what I did.  And then I put a mixed nugget in the corner and Jimmy the door open. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What happened to the Big Mac?  I couldn't see it too well.  So I stood on the Big Mac because it's so big.  And I could look inside.  She sent my baby six and I gave a bite of the Big Mac.  And the guy was healed.  He loves his Big Mac.  Oh, shit.  This guy's talking about Plagola.  Oh, man.  Torture chamber did some kind of way and locked it up, right?  So I did what I had to do and kicked the bottom of the door.  And she crawled out of it. 
[01:48:00]  She grabbed her baby.  It threw me off.  All right, we're fine.  I got some girl.  It helped you.  And what did she look like?  I mean, what was she wearing?  Jumpsuit.  She had a white tank top on.  Big Mac yellow.  Yeah, yeah.  It looked like the same color the secret sauce.  That goes on a two-all beef patty.  Secret sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onion, and all the sesame seed bumps.  Her shoes look like pickles. 
[01:48:30]  She looked like a McDonald's sign.  Oh, fuck it, Jeff.  Rings on, mascara.  She was well-groomed.  She didn't look like she was kidnapped.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what threw me off.  When she was like, I'm in here trapped.  I'm like, well, you don't look like a kidnap, so maybe you got a boyfriend problem.  Boyfriend problem.  Boyfriend problem.  Oh, boy.  So I took the kid stat for a Happy Meal.  And you'd never seen her before?  Bro.  In the year that you'd been there? 
[01:49:00]  Bro.  That man, listen, never.  That woman didn't come out the house.  The only kids that came out the house were two little girls.  They played in the backyard.  He had two dogs.  And where I live, naturally, it's next door.  My bedroom was upstairs.  So here's kids playing.  I know it's them.  They do the same thing.  Play in the backyard for a couple hours.  Go back in the house.  Same thing every day.  Who are those kids? 
[01:49:30]  The neighborhood knows them as his grandchildren.  Oh.  So it's no big deal.  He got his grandkids over all the time.  I thought kids.  Probably.  Maybe it's another kid plus one of the kidnappers.  Daughters.  Girls.  Or maybe he just brought his grandkids over and it's unconnected.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  This story's getting creepier and creepier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy, this guy, I hope this guy gets at least fucking ten years. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  I thought you were going to say, I hope he gets at least Big Macs for life.  Big Mac for life.  I mean in Big Macs for life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Team Big Mac, motherfucker.  That's right.  This next clip is great.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Amanda Berry then, what, asked her to call 911?  Mm-hmm.  And I took her into my house.  Now, I'm nervous as hell.  So, I'm fumbling with my phone.  So, I finally did it right.  She can't wait.  And I don't blame her.  So, what I do is tell her, go across the street and use their phone. 
[01:50:30]  Now, we both calling 911.  Now, she get through and I get through.  She deal with a moron.  Me, too.  The 911 operator is a moron.  By the way, on Fox, they just flashed that the 911 operator is being, like, looked into.  Because he really was.  He got off the phone.  He goes, all right, we'll send a car.  All right.  This cocksucker hung up the phone.  They obviously had something.  And that was the woman's call.  Right.  She screamed bloody murr. 
[01:51:00]  So, you got to keep her on the line.  And they don't stay on the phone.  She said, we're kidnapped.  And they hang up on her.  You don't know where that Ariel guy is.  Yeah.  He could be in, you know, pursuit of her.  Right there.  Right.  Are they chasing around the house or something?  Yeah, but they get off the phone.  All right, we'll send a car.  And he hangs up on this guy.  But those are the type of people that they put all the credence in in the fucking Zimmerman case, too.  Well, the operator said to not follow and stand down.  They don't know what they did.  They're fucking there to take the message for the cops.  Hi, the police aren't here right now. 
[01:51:30]  Can I take a message?  That's 911.  Moron.  Me, too.  You said they were, what do you mean a moron?  Idiot.  I heard the 911 call.  Idiot.  How many more fucking words do you need?  Douchebag.  Don't.  Schmuck.  Dumbass.  What do you mean a moron?  Idiot.  I heard the 911 call for her.  I didn't see it.  And the woman kept going.  I didn't have that damn job.  The woman was like, hang up and wait for the police.  Really?  How about stay on and I'll talk to them until they get there. 
[01:52:00]  So you called 911.  How quickly did the police get there?  You know why they got there so fast?  Because I said, moron.  Because I said, hey, Amanda Berry is right in front of me right now.  He had what she got on.  And I told her, white tank top, blue sweatpants, nice.  What's she wearing now?  Nice, you know, ponytail.  What else?  Oh, right.  She panicked, idiot.  Good.  He had a kidnap victim for 10 years and his cock-sucking 911 operator gets off the phone with him. 
[01:52:30]  She panicked, idiot.  This guy, he's a smart guy.  He's street smart, this Charles Ramsey.  Larry King here with Charles Ramsey.  What happened with the other half of your big man?  Did you go back to it?  Larry was getting to the important parts of the fucking story.  Did you have a half?  All right.  Wasn't super-sized.  Comment.  No ponytail.  What else?  Oh, right. 
[01:53:00]  She's panicking, idiot.  Put yourself in her shoes.  I just said, Amanda Berry, that don't ring no damn bells, you being a cop and all.  When you first saw her and she said the name Amanda Berry, did it...  It didn't know.  Because I forgot.  Bro, this is Cleveland.  Since they haven't found that girl.  Right.  And I got to stop looking for that girl.  We figured that girl met her demise.  Right.  So, Berry didn't register with me until I was on the phone like, wait a minute, I thought  this girl was dead. 
[01:53:30]  I thought this girl was dead.  He's like a modern Sherlock Holmes.  He really is.  Sherlock Holmes.  That's what he is.  Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock Holmes.  What's your name?  Sherlock Holmes.  Holmes.  I'm after the Hamburglar.  The newest case I got.  So, I opened the door a little bit.  She had to squeeze out.  It was almost like getting Megan McCheese's hair through the...  Oh, God.  Yeah, that shit was like a Ronald McDonald house of horrors. 
[01:54:00]  What does it feel like to have been living next to this for a year?  See, that's why now I'm having trouble sleep.  Oh, no.  Probably one night.  Up until yesterday, the only thing that kept me from losing sleep was the lack of money.  See what I'm saying?  What's he getting fucking...  So, now that that's going on, and I could have done this last year, not this hero stuff. 
[01:54:30]  I could do the right thing.  Do you feel like a hero?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, bro.  I'm a Christian, an American, and I'm just like you.  Well...  We bleed, same blood, put our pants on the same way.  It's just that...  Yours are a lot lower.  Exactly, yours are a lot lower, and his has a hole caught in the back.  I'm just like you, except you're white and I'm black, and you're rich and I'm poor, 
[01:55:00]  you suck dick and I don't.  Other side from all those major differences.  Put our pants on the same way.  It's just that...  You got to...  Put that...  Being a coward, and I don't want to get nobody's business, you got to put that away for a minute.  Because you know how it is, a lot of people turn the other way, and people keep walking down the street.  That's all it's about.  It's about cojones on this planet. 
[01:55:30]  Cojones?  Cojones.  You're telling me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're telling me it's about cojones.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  On this planet, on the bridge of my nose.  In my mouth.  This guy's the story.  He's great.  Yeah.  Has the FBI said anything about a reward or anything?  Because there was a reward for fine air and stuff.  I'll tell you what you do, give it to them. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Because if folks been following this case since last night, and you've been following me since last night, you know I got a job anyway.  Just wouldn't pick it up.  Paychecks.  What does that address say?  That they say?  I don't have my glasses.  I'm blind.  2203 Seymour.  Where were some girls living?  Right next door to this paycheck.  Is he drunk?  Oh, man.  So, yeah.  Take that reward and give it to them. 
[01:56:30]  That little girl came out the house, and she was crying.  And I'm looking at her right now.  I'm like, well, your mama trying to help you, girl.  Shut up.  I don't know.  Shut up.  And she's like, I want my daddy.  And I said, who is her daddy?  She said, Ariel.  Oh.  Yeah.  I said, well, how is that possible?  Because you wasn't, if you got kidnapped, oh, he was having sex with you?  Oh, Jesus.  That little girl is just, what the?  Now we want to hurt you.  You felt that? 
[01:57:00]  Bro, it would just be a different interview.  I told you that if we had known that, man, I'd be facing triple life.  Wow.  I'm glad it turned out this way.  Nice.  Triple life.  Nice to follow on it, Anderson.  Yeah.  Wow.  He is cool.  Triple life with my double patties.  I'm having trouble sleeping, man.  If I only had a Big Mac bun, I could rest my head on.  Because they're so big and comfortable. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  He also was in the studio at a Cleveland TV station.  You want to try it?  Yeah.  It wasn't as good as the Anderson Cooper, but we can give it a shot, see where it goes.  I have a...  More, more, more.  But the biggest, most mysterious question in this whole motherfucker, whatever happened  to the McDLT?  That shit was good.  It was the cold lettuce and tomato on one side and the hot patty on the other motherfucker.  But they've done discontinued that nigga. 
[01:58:00]  I don't know what the fuck.  And I checked under her shirt to see if she had any broken McRibs.  And that's the only thing he wants, is to bring that back.  Of course.  That's all he has.  Bring that back.  I love the McDLT.  Bring back the McDLT.  And we're square.  The cold side and the warm side.  The lettuce never wilted, because they didn't put the shit on the meat, till you's ready  to eat up the motherfucker.  This whole problem could have been avoided. 
[01:58:30]  It would have been avoided if they just didn't discontinue the motherfucking McDLT.  Yeah, I got some Susie Seed buns, y'all.  So he was on a Cleveland TV program with the polished anchors in studio.  And he had a nice brand new lid on.  He brought his homies with him.  And we'll give this a shot.  He's got his crew.  Yeah.  I opened the door, naturally, as you can see on the news.  And it wouldn't come.  It wouldn't, bro.  He had a lock on there. 
[01:59:00]  And you couldn't open it.  And the homies had to.  When they got there, they finally, you know, got a job.  And Amanda says, it's two more girls up there.  And I looked at her.  And I looked at the cop that was in the middle of the street.  And he said, it's what?  And she said, I am not the only one.  And they went up there in about, I don't know, 15, 20 seconds.  They were coming out with Gina and that other girl.  And I said, oh, my God.  Charles, you've done so much. 
[01:59:30]  And we are all grateful for the fact that you were there then and that you were able to help them.  As you go through this, a lot of people were wondering how the community didn't know.  Were there, were the windows boarded up?  Had you not heard anything in that house?  All I would hear was salsa music.  That's all we played, naturally.  Naturally.  Naturally.  Naturally.  See?  We're a racist, Ramon, everyone.  But we all are racist.  You know, all we heard was salsa music.  Naturally.  Naturally. 
[02:00:00]  Naturally.  Because those people played that music.  Yeah, you know.  That's as common as seeing a newborn with pierce ears in this neighborhood, motherfucker.  But of course.  Naturally.  That's funny.  Oh, shit.  We all have our shit.  Naturally.  He pulled up in his car, all jumpity-jumpity.  I couldn't see behind a fuzzy dice, as you know.  Of course, though.  Naturally.  It was Cinco de Mayo. 
[02:00:30]  Naturally.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah, we didn't even think twice about a bunch of them living in the same house.  You can understand.  Yes, yes.  Of course.  Of course.  Anything in that house?  All I would hear was salsa music.  That's how we play, naturally.  One day, I was playing my music.  Rap music.  Naturally.  He came to my house and told me, turn my music down because I'm disturbing him.  At this time, he was a bus driver. 
[02:01:00]  I understood that.  He had to get up in the morning and go drive the bus.  Then, when that came about yesterday, it had nothing to do with you getting some sleep.  That's why I was bothering you.  That's why I had to turn my music down.  How can I be disturbing you?  What are you doing in there?  You weren't reading the Bible.  Damn.  I'm not.  The one thing I don't know, how did they pick up Ariel?  Where was he?  Did they just wait for him to come home and fucking nap him?  They might even know where he was going or maybe, you know, they just...  How's that even came out?  How did they pick him up and his two brothers? 
[02:01:30]  I don't know.  There it is.  There's McDLT.  The hot side and the cold side.  Why don't we know that part of this?  Maybe they know every other detail.  I don't know.  I'm sure it'll come out.  It's probably just some...  What did they say?  He was going to McDonald's or something?  I think he was going to McDonald's as well.  Was he really?  I think so.  McDonald's is fucking, what, a little less...  Holy shit, right?  Yeah, a little less exposure here.  What was the other food option?  McDonald's or the new goat shit palace that opened up?  We have cold goat shit.  We have hot goat shit.  We have goat shit that's sliced and diced and we have melted goat shit. 
[02:02:00]  You can eat it on peanut bread or panty bread.  We don't know what it's called.  Or McDonald's.  Or you can eat it on the folded scrotum of a horse.  Goat shit wrapped in folded horse scrotum.  Or McDonald's.  I think I'll go McDonald's.  They all get along at McDonald's.  Yeah.  Perbs, sex slaves, and heroes.  They all...  Yeah.  They all fuel their souls with McDonald's. 
[02:02:30]  Yes, we've all been brought together.  Jesus.  What did they say to you?  He told me.  He said, you got who?  I said, I got 911.  Oh, yeah, he's talking about the 911 operator.  Oh, right.  I got a man of beer with me right now.  I'm sending the police.  This dispatcher said, stop playing on this line.  You don't got her.  I said, well, send the police, moron, and arrest me if I'm lying.  They took...  They didn't believe me.  Now, since so many people have been calling them probably through the years and say, we got it. 
[02:03:00]  I understand that you were just a little apprehensive about that call.  She called, too.  Now, you got two people calling you 911 at the same time.  Somebody came to be lying.  How did Amanda look when you finally rescued her?  Fine.  She was trembling, happy that she saw someone else other than her...  She was shaking, and if you want a good shake...  Her main concern was that child.  I didn't know what that baby was crying about. 
[02:03:30]  Did she come out with the child?  Yes, and I didn't...  And I was like, who is this kid?  Yeah.  And she said, well, this is his daughter.  His daughter.  And I'm like, well, how?  She had a grimace on her face.  You weren't pregnant then?  And then they get, well, put...  Do the math.  I said, oh, damn.  Well...  It's okay.  That's all right.  Oh, that's all right.  That's all right.  Thank God that's all right.  That's all right.  Oh, that's all right.  That's all right.  The Cleveland guy.  Oh, the stupid Cleveland guy.  We understand. 
[02:04:00]  I think the Cleveland guy used to be in New York, too.  You're looking familiar.  Oh, really?  That's why the guy was taking her to the park, though.  It's his daughter, too.  To the park?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you fucking decipher that shit in your little brain?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're taking daddy away.  Good Lord.  Just hit him with a bat.  Hit the guy with a bat.  She's going to have a little bit of baggage there to deal with.  A little bit.  A few daddy issues, perhaps?  Daddy was a what?  Yeah.  I'm here.  Why?  Yeah.  How did I come around? 
[02:04:30]  That's when Anthony swoops in like a falcon.  I smell daddy issues like a fucking...  Like a vulture smells a carcass.  And I react much the same way.  Pick their bones clean of meat.  Exactly.  Tell her it's legal to vote, and then you just drop them somewhere.  He talks about being a hero.  Ah.  Let me ask you this.  You touched on this earlier.  Has it sunk in just how much attention you're getting?  As Aaron was pointing out earlier, you're trending on Twitter. 
[02:05:00]  The world is talking about what you did.  Your name is all over the place.  It's a hashtag Chuck Ramsey everywhere.  Do you have any idea of the attention that you're getting around the world right now?  I don't even want it, nor looking for it, bro.  That's why when they keep saying I'm a hero, let me tell you something.  I'm American, and I'm a human being.  A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  As is the big man.  There was a woman in distress.  So why turn your back on that?  Or that dress.  My father would have whooped the hell out of me if he had found out that I was a coward out. 
[02:05:30]  See, you tough in these bars, and you beat a woman, but you won't help one out?  You're a man, huh?  No, I'm the definition of a man, bro.  Wow.  Were you ever concerned that Ariel would come back?  I am a man.  Yes.  That's only because I was doing something that I had no business doing, which was prying his door open on his property.  So he had every right to, you know, getting some type of altercation with me because I'm on private property. 
[02:06:00]  Even though I'm doing a good deed, he's still on my property.  You understand what I'm saying?  So I was thinking about him.  But at the time, and I got, you know, I wish you'd bring my squad with me.  I got an entourage.  He's got an entourage.  We weren't worried about it anyway.  That's why I told the police.  If we had known about this, we would have never got that call.  It would have just been some corners coming, putting a white sheet over somebody.  And we would have went on with our life.  Because we would have handled that, bro.  We would have handled the situation. 
[02:06:30]  He's talking about that.  Yeah, I'm a hero.  I'm all nice and shit, but this could have gone the other way, motherfucker.  Kung fu fighting.  Yeah.  We got a dispatcher on the line who wants to explain what the fuck they did wrong up  there in Cleveland.  Chris in Canada.  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Hey, Chris.  Hey, Tom.  Tell Jerry I said hi, okay?  Okay.  Thanks.  Yeah, I used to dispatch up in Saginaw, Michigan.  And that guy that talked to Watson up there, he was all right. 
[02:07:00]  But the guy that talked to the girl, they didn't verify the information of what they  were saying, like, you know, kidnapping.  I mean, how many calls do you get for a kidnap?  And you don't.  You know, one maybe in your fucking career.  I'd never gotten a call for a real kidnapping.  So didn't verify the information.  Didn't check for officer safety.  Is anybody else in the house?  You know, the guy just fucked up.  And part of the problem with all that stuff is they're hiring these $7 or $8 dispatchers  to work in these major areas and not enough training and not enough officers to cover the 
[02:07:30]  call.  So what they're told is, okay, take the call, get the information, get them off, and we'll  take the next call and we'll prioritize the calls and send the police out when they  can.  It's just fucking ridiculous.  Yeah, man.  He should have got a lot more info.  You're right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because you're putting the cops in danger.  Exactly.  They don't know what they're to expect when they get to the House of Horrors.  House of Horrors.  House of Horrors.  Wee, wee, wee. 
[02:08:00]  Yep.  I just showed in a picture.  USA Today going with the headline House of Horrors, just like you said.  Oh, that'll be a big House of Horrors house.  What hacks the media are.  What fucking hacks.  House of Horrors.  Yeah.  Going to be a fun Halloween.  Chris, thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Anything else?  Yeah, just, I mean, again, with the officer's safety, if he would have asked her, she would  have fucking told him there's more people in the house instead of, you know, just going  over there talking to her and then finding out there's somebody in the house.  She should have fucking, you know, had officers go to the house and her at the same time. 
[02:08:30]  They didn't know who was in there.  The guy could have been in there killing the other girls, you know?  Right.  You're absolutely right, brother.  Thanks, Chris.  Little insight on the life of a dispatcher.  They found Ariel at McDonald's.  They really did?  They honestly did?  Yes.  That's hilarious.  No fucking way.  Yes.  That's coming in.  Jesus.  They got him at McDonald's.  Man.  That Ariel loves their McDonald's.  Holy fuck.  Well, again, you know, the goat shit palace is the only other place. 
[02:09:00]  Yes, yes, the only other option.  It really gets a bum rap, the goat shit palace.  Yes, it does.  And now Charles Ramsey wants to get his hands on the person that did this.  Ariel, I believe.  As you said, you have an entourage and your manager over there is saying you have to leave.  But let me ask you one last question before you go.  You talked about you're not a hero.  You were doing what you had to do.  Knowing what you did, knowing the attention that you're getting, knowing how grateful people  are that because of you, these ladies are now free. 
[02:09:30]  How do you feel today?  Oh, I'm all right.  I'm all right.  I want to get my hands on him and then I'll be all right.  Put me in the face over there with him and I'll be all right.  Other than that, I mean, it is what it is, bro.  You know, God's smiling on somebody.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Chuck.  Thanks.  Oh, yeah.  We appreciate it.  Oh, yeah.  We really appreciate it.  Good luck to you.  You too, bro.  He gave him that personal touch.  Yeah.  Hey, Chuck.  Good luck, Chuck.  Chuck, I feel like I won that McDonald's Monopoly game they do so often. 
[02:10:00]  I feel like I won, like, the grand prize of the motherfucker.  How are you feeling that you've rescued these people?  I'm loving it.  I'm loving it.  Oh.  I wouldn't put it past them.  It's true.  Just blurting out the catchphrase.  Yes.  Yeah.  Slug line.  I don't know what I'm going to do next, but, man, I'm hungry. 
[02:10:30]  I'm a little hungry.  Where should I go?  He fucking is just, he's a very street smart motherfucker, this guy.  And it seems like it's all he wants.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all he wants.  Just a bunch of coupons.  Yeah, coupons.  It leads to the auto-tune.  Uh-huh.  To wrap this breakup nicely.  In this day and age, doesn't it always lead to the auto-tuned fucking song?  So quick.  This one is very viral right now.  It's called Dead Giveaway. 
[02:11:00]  And can I give a tea?  Are we going to break after this?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we'll have a little time to fuck around before the break.  Oh, okay.  Say it's the premiere of The Goose.  Here's Dead Giveaway.  I'm talking with Charles Ramsey.  He's a neighbor.  Walk me through again what happened this afternoon.  I knew something was wrong when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms.  Dead Giveaway.  Dead Giveaway.  My neighbor got big testicles because we see this dude every day.  We eat ribs with this dude.

And she comes out and she says, get some more girls up in that house.  Call 911 and they called him at McDonald's.  I knew something was wrong when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms.  Dead Giveaway.  Dead Giveaway.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, that's good.  We see this dude every day.

No one cares when I fly out there.  How are the tickets?  Actually, I'm pretty good.  Good.

For your broad.  By the way, when we come back, the premiere of The Goose.  What is that?  It's a new cop drama.  Oh, no.  You and your cop drama.  Is that the guy that's got, what, he's hard as nails? 
[02:14:00]  Tough as nails with a heart of gold.  Does he have his own demons?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  Very well-rounded character.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  You both have a line of dialogue.  Ooh.  Oh.  Do I?  It's really good stuff.  Yeah.  I can't wait.  Yeah, the goose.  Goose.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:30]  Tom Poppins studio.  Playing Philly.  Inside the Kimmel Center.  Fucking Chippa.  Right.  We get it.  The Perlman Theater.  Perlman Theater.  The Kimmel Center.  We get it.  At the Kimmel Center.  Oh, Chippa.  It's going to be a big show.  Yeah.  Boy, Jimmy Kimmel's hosting it.  No.  Jimmy Kimmel will be there.  It's the Kimmel Center.  Me and Jimmy Kimmel. 
[02:15:00]  You know, they caught the Berkowitz dude 35 years ago today.  Oh, yeah?  35 years ago today.  With all this shit going down in Cleveland.  35 years ago.  David Berkowitz.  Yeah.  Blast from the past.  The son of Sam.  The .44 caliber killer.  Yeah.  He had a bunch of them.  He also admitted to setting thousands of fires in and around New York.  Yeah?  Figures.  Little douchey fire bug.  You're the little fire bug.  Anything worse than a fire bug?  No.  Fire bug.  Fucking assholes.  Then they go and stand there and watch it.  They do watch.  Just watch the fire. 
[02:15:30]  The fire bug watches his fire that he's set.  Fire bug walks up to the crowd.  Hey, what's up?  What happened?  Now there's a fire on the...  Oh, yeah.  Coincidentally, my neck hair is singed.  It smells like gasoline.  Yeah.  No one notices he's the guy.  No eyebrows.  What's all this about?  Right.  Fire, dummy.  Were any of the fires impressive that David Berkowitz set?  I don't remember fires as much as dead people in cars and parks. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wasn't he talking to his dog?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was the neighbor's dog.  Son of Sam.  Son of Sam angle of the whole time.  Son of Sam.  Oh.  And then he turns out to just be a pudgy Jewish postal worker.  You picture, like, at the time, you were horrified.  Sure.  You picture, like, this ominous-looking fucking villain.  And then it's just like, oi, David Berkowitz?  He was such a nice boy.  Not my David, my David. 
[02:16:30]  He found God in prison, right?  He did.  He found God.  And now he's got a great little life in prison.  Yeah.  Mentoring and teaching.  And fuck these guys.  Eating cherry Danish.  That get these second chances at life, even though they're in prison.  They're fucking celebrities.  Yeah.  They get everything they need.  And it just becomes where they live now.  It's not a prison is, if that's all you have is your life, you're adaptable.  You make the best of it. 
[02:17:00]  We're looking at pictures of him on the Google image.  And there's pictures of him just smiling.  Smiling.  Enjoying his life.  He should never.  It's a different life, but he's enjoying it.  He should never be in a position where he smiles.  No.  He should never be like, wow, I'm happy for a second.  They should actually have fish hooks in his lips.  So if he smiles, it lifts weights and it hurts him.  Constantly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But no rent.  No job.  No.  Hanging out.  Yeah.  You don't give a fuck if the economy collapses.  What will I do today?  You know what? 
[02:17:30]  I'll spew some of my religion to some of these younger guys and tell them that they got to  get their life straight.  You know, it's an ego boost for these guys that they're looked at.  The guards and the psychiatrists and psychologists in prison look and go, wow, he's come so far.  They congratulate him, pat him on the back.  Why should he have this?  He enjoys being a celebrity, too.  Of course he does.  He knows everyone's looking at him like, oh, wow.  You're telling me people don't enjoy celebrity?  It's fantastic.  Life's for him. 
[02:18:00]  He should never be able to.  Free screenings.  He should never be able to eat another macaroon as long as he lives.  That's what fucking life is about.  Right.  It just doesn't make sense.  What's the anniversary?  35 years ago.  35 years?  They call him 35 years ago, right?  No, pled guilty.  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.  David Berkowitz pled guilty to the son of Sam Killings 35 years ago.  Scum like that needs to be off the street.  Uh-oh.  Who are you?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:18:30]  Is it Goose?  The Goose.  The Goose.  Is it The Goose?  It's not his real name, though.  But it's a nickname.  Yeah.  Where did he get that name?  Well, his name is Walt Jenkins.  Oh.  And he's known as the Mongoose.  Walt Jenkins!  Because he can get through places?  No.  Because he's a snake chaser.  Wait, a goose?  No, but they'll say, like, he's a snake chaser because he's a mongoose.  Oh, mongoose.  And they call him Goose for short.  So they'll say, get the goose when there's, like, a tough case to cry.  Oh, because the snake and the mongoose go at it. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Walt Jenkins.  Walt Jenkins.  He sounds like a cowboy.  Yeah.  Walt Jenkins.  You both have a line, too.  You both have a shot.  No, he wrote our lines.  He wrote our lines out.  I'm not shitting you, people.  We actually have lines.  Pass that down to Opie.  Sorry, I don't have one for you, Tom.  This is just the beginning.  No, I'm excited just to watch.  No, no, don't show us.  Opie's line.  Come on.  Is it one line?  Yeah, it's just one or two lines.  You don't look at it first.  All right.  Who goes first?  Opie, you go first, and then Ant, and then...  Wait, he's got a whole script. 
[02:19:30]  Just a couple lines to get people interested.  Now, am I reading the whole thing, or is it...  Just that, yeah.  After Opie reads his.  It's like a trailer.  Chief, I can't be partners.  Hold on, hold on.  Do we have any dramatic music?  Yeah, I get some dramatic music.  Oh, God, Sal's back there.  Oh, great.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be some type of cop-sounding, some kind of dramatic, like you would hear  in a cop show.  E-Rock picked the worst time to leave his fucking post.  Exactly, the worst time to go have a diuretic shift.  Hope you had a nice piss, Arnold.  Come on, Sal.  What's all the... 
[02:20:00]  Yes, E-Rock's trudging.  No.  No, this is more scary.  What is this?  My marquee post.  This is Walt Jenkins.  That's a lifetime fucking movie called My Husband.  My husband hit me in the cunt with a hat.  Yeah, my husband started out nice, and now he's trying to kill me on Lifetime.  My husband punched my cunt through a hat like the Susquehanna Hat Company.  You don't know who you live with.  The story you're about to see is true.  No, that won't really drag either.  All right, we're just looking around. 
[02:20:30]  You just need...  That's good.  That's kind of good.  All right, yeah.  I like that.  Chief, I can't be partners with this guy.  He doesn't play well with others.  Damn it, Jenkins!  You gotta start playing by the rules, or I'll drum you out of the department.  I'll play by the rules when the bad guys do.  You can take my badge, but you can't take my heart. 
[02:21:00]  Okay, bugger, what's next?  So, is it Mr. Right?  Huh?  So, speak literally.  Okay.  I hate you.  That was, um...  O-M-G.  Action.  Pass.  Doesn't play well with others.  Plays by his own rules.  All right, what's the next line?  That's it for now.  I like that.  Got a lot of heart.  That's it for now. 
[02:21:30]  That's it for now.  I kind of like it, though.  It's a good teaser.  The goose.  I do like it.  Yeah, you want to know...  Who were these?  They were cops, too?  Yeah, I'm the chief.  Yeah.  That's good.  And I'm the detective.  Get the hell in here, Jenkins.  Yeah.  I do a lot of that.  What I do now, chief.  Sit down.  God damn it.  20 cars.  A diner.  And three people shot.  Yeah.  Well, that's worth it.  To see that little boy's smile. 
[02:22:00]  It's the heart of gold part, right?  That's right.  The heart of gold.  Tough as nails is trash in a city.  Yeah.  The heart of gold.  Yeah.  I'd flip over 2,000 cars and burn 10 million diners to see that smile.  All right, but you've got 24 hours, and that's it.  Yeah, that's 23 hours more than I'll need, chief.  Get the hell out of my office.  Yeah, and you can partner him up with someone who plays by the rules. 
[02:22:30]  I wish people could see that Jimmy's actually standing.  Of course.  I mean, goose, goose, goose.  Yeah, I'm a snake hunter.  You got a snake in the garden?  You call the goose.  I don't want to watch this.  I love the laundry list of destruction, and it doesn't lead to, like, instant fucking jail or anything.  No, no, no, no.  It's all forgiven from that little boy's smile.  Sure.  That's what does it.  If it was anybody but the goose, there'd be trouble.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  The goose.  Chief has the goose on a long leash.  I've had my badge taken so many times, it's like a damn revolving door.  Oh, boy.  Another partner, Jenkins.  You went through another partner?  Yeah, well, you'll line them up, and I'll knock them down, chief.  They're all dominoes to the goose.  We got one.  We got one.  No, Martha in New York.  Go ahead.  Real fast, Martha.  Go.  Jenkins, you got to say, I got the mayor breathing down my neck.  Yes, yes.  I was just going to say that.  Yeah.  Jenkins, I understand what you're trying to do. 
[02:23:30]  But I got the mayor breathing down my neck.  Yeah?  Well, tell the mayor to chew a breath mint.  So he's just yelling.  Of course.  The chief has to yell all the time.  The mongoose don't back up for no one.  Oh, oh, oh.  The mongoose.  You straighten up and fly right, or you'll be walking a beat downtown.  Yeah, well, I'll crook down and fly left if it helps save that family. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The chief always has a bunch of other problems going on.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't need this on top of it.  Oh, the phone rings.  All right, get out of here.  It's just on to the next thing.  Hey, and then you'll say, get out of here.  Hey, I see those anger management classes are working.  Oh, oh.  Get a good laugh from the audience.  Yeah, that's a laugh right there.  Yeah.  Because obviously they're not working, or he's probably not even going.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  I don't know what you're doing.  Oh, I forgot.  Oh, right, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, what?  Like, I don't know what you're trying to do, but while you guys are doing it, you're just  mucking up the works.  Oh, mucking up the works.  He says that a lot.  All right.  I got politicians and treasurers to answer to.  The buck stops here at my desk.  Yeah, well, the buck starts with me.  You can talk to all those muckety-mucks.  They're just mucking about while I'm out.  You're not in charge, Jenkins. 
[02:25:00]  I'm in charge of my area.  Area.  With that, we got Tracy.  Tracy, go ahead.  All right.  Here goes.  You got to do this.  I'm getting too old for this shit.  Oh.  The famous line, of course.  The famous line.  God damn it, I'm getting too old for this shit.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  Maybe you should take an early retirement cake.  Oh, boy.  Instead of sitting here mucking up about my investigation.  Oh.  You think other detectives got time to take calls from your ex-wife?  Well, if they don't have time to take calls from my ex-wife, they should throw out their watches.  Oh, Goose.  He's got a little flask.  You keep a little flask of whiskey.  Yeah.  Take a shot.  She's not my ex. 
[02:26:00]  She's my why.  I don't know why I did it.  If it wasn't for that little girl we put together.  She's sick, my little girl.  Put her together.  Yeah.  Put her together?  What the fuck?  My little girl is sick.  She needs a vaginal operation.  She doesn't have to work for her all for time.  Her vagina's sideways.  My little girl has a sideways vagina.  Oh, Goose.  She can't even go on the jungle gym.  Goose, we don't need to hear this. 
[02:26:30]  Pick up your badge and gun off the desk.  I'm not letting you quit.  My little girl needs an operation.  I'm not letting you quit.  Get out there.  I don't like your tactics a lot of times, Jenkins, but we need guys like you out on the street.  You may not like my tactics, but you daggone sure like my results.  The garden's free of snakes when the goose is on patrol.  Oh, look, no one calls you the goose.  No one calls you the goose. 
[02:27:00]  I've heard it so many times while you're down there mucking up the works.  And then by the end, I'm like, all right, goose.  I give in.  Call him goose.  Right, exactly.  And I'll say something like, you want to drink, chief?  Get out of here.  You sure you don't want to drink from my flask?  Although my halitosis is on it.  That is fucking working too late drinking and coffee breath.  I have coffee and rotted tooth breath. 
[02:27:30]  I have a rotted tooth that's been hanging by a nerve.  I have rotted tooth odor in my mouth.  And a plaque buildup.  Oh, Jenkins.  Thick enough to ice skate on.  Jenkins always gives a little too much information about his daughter and his teeth.  Where does Jenkins live?  In his house.  I live next door to these Spanish people in Cleveland. 
[02:28:00]  Not very perceptive, are you, Jenkins?  I'm a damn good cop.  I helped them board up all the windows.  Just so you can see the smile in those little captain teams' faces.  Yeah, just so you can see the smile.  And to stop that kid, they're always waving at me from up to the window.  I was afraid they were going to fall out, so I boarded up the window.  They love playing police with you.  Absolutely.  I would always walk in there and make sure that the handcuff things on the wall are good and tight. 
[02:28:30]  Holy fuck.  Jenkins.  We got another one.  Tom, go ahead, Tom.  The press is going to have a field day with this.  Yes.  Yes, Jenkins is never doing things the press really are sympathetic on.  Tell them what you have to.  They're just going to muck up the works anyway.  Always in trouble, but a heart of gold, though.  Heart of gold.  Heart of gold.  What was it?  It was tough as nails.  Tough as nails.  With a heart of gold. 
[02:29:00]  Heart of gold.  I don't see it getting picked up.  I've already got like a bunch of episodes written.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Different things.  Oh, cool.  Like there's a nuclear bomb one time in Times Square in a box.  Yeah.  And Jenkins has to take it and throw it in the river.  Why is...  That never happens.  But the river's not going to solve the problem.  But they get like FBI, Homeland Security, things like that.  They weren't available.  The cop, the regular cop, isn't doing anything, really. 
[02:29:30]  Jenkins is a detective.  He's doing like fucking crowd control.  Well, he takes matter into his own hands while they're all just mucking up the works.  Oh, mucking up the works.  Is that like his catchphrase?  Yeah.  You're mucking up the works.  Yeah, you're mucking up the works.  And everyone goes, oh, he said it.  He said it.  You're mucking up the investigation.  It's like dino mite for Jimmy J.J. Walker.  So there's one where he does that.  One where he stops the hijacking and saves all the passengers.  Because the pilots got poisoned.  So Jenkins has to land the plane.  Jenkins lands a plane.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  He lands the plane.  It's a 747 with like 300 people on it.  And he lands it and saves all their lives.  This goose can fly.  Jenkins.  Jenkins, keep your nose up.  Come in.  Keep those wings level.  Now give a little flaps.  I'm talking you in.  Little flaps.  My little girl's flaps.  I have to get surgery on her little flaps.  Oh, goose.  A little flap. 
[02:30:30]  Jesus.  Oh, that's terrible.  I know how to fly this thing.  I flew back in Desert Storm.  Oh, we did.  Was he a pilot back in Desert Storm?  Yeah, I did a little piloting.  I saved the whole platoon.  Oh, I like the back story here.  And I like the peripheral daughter.  Yeah.  But I didn't do things the Army's way.  So they kicked me out.  Oh, oh, oh.  But I saved that platoon.  You flew for the Army?  Yeah.  All right.  Army planes.  Army planes.  And whatnot. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And there's always a general mucking up the works.  Oh, okay.  General mucking up the works.  Will they have flashback segments?  That would be cool.  Yeah, that would be good.  Like a flashing back.  Yeah, me and like of my partner in the field yelling,  Oh, Jenkins!  No!  Like a Middle Eastern child in trouble.  Yeah.  And he dies because somebody was mucking up the works.  Right.  And that's why he's got this aversion to people mucking up the works.  Yeah, he doesn't like it.  Oh, I like it now. 
[02:31:30]  Now I'm liking the war angle.  People, you know, the old war vet comes back to clean up his fucking city.  That's right.  I want my town to be tidy.  And it's New York?  No.  It's not New York City?  No.  You said a bomb in Times Square.  Yeah, I know, but Jenkins is vacationing in New York.  He was just in to see some shows.  Like Die Hard.  John McClane went out to California.  He's taking in Shrek the musical.  Jenkins lives in a small town in Iowa. 
[02:32:00]  It's called Clugmar Village.  It's double wide.  So he's not even in a big city?  No.  Clugmar Village.  What the fuck?  How much crime could happen that he really needs to be so proactive?  Really not a lot.  Yeah.  It's a town of 600 people.  Most in golf carts.  Over 50.  Not bothering anyone.  Busting bingo games.  Right.  Yeah.  Illegal bingo games. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  I thought it was a big city fucking cop.  Can we talk about Dawn for a second?  Dawn!  Did you see this article on the paper?  My sister?  Not Anthony's sister, who we all love.  Oh, the news guy?  Yeah, the news guy.  Oh, man.  I thought this was a joke or I thought he was doing this for some kind of fucking expose  or story for ABC News.  The look in the eye.  I guess he's a top producer for ABC News.  He's a bottom.  His name's Don Ennis. 
[02:33:00]  And he walks into ABC the other day as Dawn.  Yeah.  He went from like a chubby, bald, middle-aged looking guy to a girl with fancy hair.  Wow.  And he almost pulls it off when you put the wig on him.  Oh, boy.  Well, he puts a lot of hair in his face.  A lot of hairs in his face.  Is that all he did?  He just dressed up like it?  Pretty much.  He has, it's not a surgery thing?  No.  He just likes to do it.  He just walks in.  I'm done now.  And all the workers have to say, okay? 
[02:33:30]  He likes to, yeah, yeah, that's the part about it that's fucked up.  All the workers just have to say, all right.  All right.  You know, there was one guy from sales who just went, I'm out.  I'm not fucking entertaining this guy's little whimsy.  I understand we're all supposed to have more tolerance these days, but this wouldn't, this is rough.  It really was.  If one of you guys walked in here and said, fucking chick, that would be rough.  That would be really weird.  That would be rough.  It's like you're daring management to say anything. 
[02:34:00]  It's like.  Right.  Right?  Hey, look, one guy says he doesn't like me as Don.  I take him to court.  I'm a rich man.  Oh, my God.  It's a win-win.  Uh-huh.  He walked into his Manhattan office on Friday in a little black dress and a brunette bobbed wig  and announced to colleagues that from now on he would like to be known as Don.  I think everyone would openly just start laughing.  That's funny, Don.  What a great joke.  What a great joke.  You're a kidder.  You're great.  49-year-old father of three.  He's splitting from his wife of 17 years to become a woman. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Or Don.  That's good for the kids.  Stacey Ennis.  She is now known on her governmental records.  Today, I begin a new.  She wrote on her Facebook.  Today, I begin a new.  Don wrote on his Facebook timeline.  Hey.  Well, she debuted a flirty new profile picture.  Flirty.  Wow.  It is a flirty picture.  It is flirty.  It's like that come hither eyes.  Please understand this is not a game of dress up or make believe.  It's my affirmation of who I now am and what I must do to be happy in response to a soul-crushing secret 
[02:35:00]  that my wife and I have been dealing with for more than seven years.  Mostly in secret.  So what do we have to call dad again?  Yeah.  That's the poor kid.  You know what?  Sometimes you've got to tuck your dreams away for the fucking well-being of the next generation.  You can't fucking all of a sudden.  It's a sacrifice you've got to make.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Suck it up.  There is a selfishness there.  Yes.  When you do become a father, Tom knows you'll lose a lot of your old shit. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  No.  It's not about you anymore.  Exactly.  And if you have to now bear this cross that you feel like you're a woman, but you're walking  around a man, that's something you then just have to live with the rest of your life going,  well, here's the road I chose.  Yeah.  I can't.  You're fucking your children up.  That's right.  So what do we have to get them for Mother's Day?  It's Mother's Day now.  Steven Singer Rose.  What do we get them?  Do we have to?  It's a whole list of things you've got to say bye-bye to when you become a father. 
[02:36:00]  Two Mommy's Day gifts, no Father's Day gift?  Right.  How does this work?  Maybe the kids are grown.  No, they've only been married 17 years, so the kids are still in the house.  Oh, it's so selfish.  I'm sorry, there's a selfishness to the whole fucking thing.  Yes, completely.  Just get, if you have those moments, get a hotel room by yourself, dress up, have a weird  night, and then go back to being a dad.  Be the whore that you are, and then go back to fucking being a dad.  I don't believe parents should stick together for the sake of the children, so get the fucking 
[02:36:30]  divorce if that part of it's not working.  Right, right.  And then play dress up wherever the fuck you want.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Weird.  Oh, look at that look.  Kind of passable.  Kind of passable.  Kind of passable.  You know why?  He's got a pudgy, not angular feature.  That's not passable.  Oh, wow.  That one's a little rough.  That's rough.  That works in a library in the back section.  Jesus.  That looks familiar.  Don slash Don said he, she suffers from an unusual hormonal imbalance and blames his, 
[02:37:00]  her mother who fed her female hormones as a child to prolong a commercial acting career.  The hormones made the little boy look and sound young.  Is this Mikey?  But Don slash Don said she eventually developed a breast.  Nice.  Doctors can't explain or remedy her condition, and she's been undergoing hormone replacement  therapy to maintain mysteriously more female than male body.  The mother fucking gave the kid female hormones to prolong a child commercial career? 
[02:37:30]  To keep his child acting going.  What commercials was he in?  I've got to see that.  It's great.  Well, it depends on the commercial if it was worthwhile or not.  Right.  It was a national spot.  Right.  Sure.  Yeah.  Instead of some dumb car dealership in the middle of a little fucking My Little Pony commercial.  A little fruit.  A lot of people wondering.  She, Don, Don, whatever, hasn't undergone a surgical sex change, but says her marriage  is wrecked and his, her personality and way of thinking has changed. 
[02:38:00]  If you're the boss and you just think, just because he's got all that stuff going on,  how's he going to run meetings?  How's he going to get the kids just get rid of him?  And you can't.  Very distracting.  And you can't get rid of him because it's going to just come down on you that you're not  accepting.  You're the one that has to, you're not inclusive.  The day after she, he, I keep seeing she, he, it gets confusing just to read the story.  I know.  Announced his decision to colleagues. 
[02:38:30]  She left her wife, Wendy, and moved out of the house.  All right.  They're moving on as far as a couple goes.  Yeah.  But to announce this to the world, man, the kids, holy fuck.  He's not a young guy.  I mean, you.  That's to the kids, isn't it?  You should say that for the young.  Cross-dressing.  Guys don't look good as old ladies.  Things like that is for the young.  Right.  It's for the young.  You should have done it when you were 15.  Right.  Now like a middle-aged man going to a middle-aged woman.  It's not a thing that should be. 
[02:39:00]  If you're, if you're too old to, let's say, skateboard, you shouldn't don women's clothing  and a wig, you'll just look bad.  All of a sudden, yeah, you're, you're an old lady.  It's like, it's not like I want to be a woman.  It's like, now you want to be an old lady.  I want to be a hag.  She wants to be a hag.  And they always pick the worst lady clothes, too.  Yeah.  Big shoes.  Oh, just horrible shit that no one else is wearing.  Just when you think you know how life's going to end, this happens and starts mucking up 
[02:39:30]  the works.  Oh.  Come on, Goose is still in the studio.  I would think Goose would be more tolerant.  No.  Mm-hmm.  He's not.  Oh, Goose isn't very tolerant.  You want to know who this guy is?  No.  I don't know.  I mean, we have, that means we have to do something that we don't like doing.  And that is trust a listener.  Oh, no.  You want to play trust a listener?  Yeah.  We don't really, but we need a little fucking stinger for trust a listener.  Trust the listener, yes.  Here's Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, what's up, boys? 
[02:40:00]  It's me, Jimmy from Staten Island.  Oh, of course we know you.  We just said that.  Oh, Kenny, did you have the plug this year?  What?  What?  Christmas lights?  You don't remember me.  Perfect.  Oh, right.  You're the crazy Christmas light guy.  Right, right, right.  Do we have his original phone call there, E-Rock?  He's the crazy guy.  I actually loved this guy when he first called our show.  He's a little nutty.  All right, listen, Jacob.  Listen.  Now he's trying to work his character.  You got to work the character.  You got to work the character.  The guy who did the original Charlie Browns, his mother used to do the same thing, give 
[02:40:30]  him female hormones.  See, I thought it was not.  See, it's not the thing.  He said, yeah, trust a listener.  The guy who was the original Charlie Brown, he did hormones.  See, that you would speculate that that is who they're talking about.  I was thinking this might have been the original Charlie Brown.  I think whoever's typing in, whoever typed that in, typed it in very vaguely.  Now, listen.  Sal?  If you Google him, you'll see he just had a case recently. 
[02:41:00]  He would kill up because he'd be making shit out of his girlfriend or something.  Shut up.  Yeah, Charlie Brown.  Yeah.  Look, now that Governor Christie is losing all that weight, can we get him to pull his  fucking pants down to a normal level?  Dude, I saved a picture on my phone.  Did you?  I'm obsessed with how high his pants always have to be.  It's the highest I've ever seen a guy's pants.  But now that he's losing the weight, fucking move your waistline down.  They're so fucking high.  Do you really have a picture of his pants up high? 
[02:41:30]  Yes, of his giant fucking high pants.  Holy fuck.  They just showed him on TV.  Now that he's losing the weight, they have new video.  But his pants are still way the fuck too high.  Look at him sitting with his...  He makes his own waist.  Look, look at him.  Look at his pants that high.  It's crazy.  Yeah, they're up to his nipples.  It's like...  That's...  And it's more than William Frawley ever did.  The pants are above his belly button easily.  Yes.  In that picture you were showing.  They're almost under his armpit.  They are directly under the fat. 
[02:42:00]  That side tit fat.  The fat people get under the armpits.  His pants are up to there.  And the belt is across his fucking...  But he got the lap band, which is different than having his stomach taken out, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The lap band is a pound a week.  What do they do?  A pound a week.  So it's a lot slower.  So he's hoping...  It's adjustable too or something.  What is it?  It's like a zip strip that they put around the bottom of the esophagus. 
[02:42:30]  What is that called?  Pretty much right before the stomach.  Yeah, and they fucking wrap it around there and squish it to a certain diameter and don't  allow as much shit in there.  It's not as dramatic.  They get sectioned off a piece of your stomach with it where your stomach is a lot smaller  and it's fucked up.  This is a lot slower.  How do they get in there?  I don't know.  How do they get in there?  How do they get in there?  With those fucking...  Laparoscopic surgery.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  40-minute surgery.  Now the other ones, the stomach's staplings are much bigger, right? 
[02:43:00]  That's brutal, but you'll lose a lot of weight a lot faster.  This one, it's a slower process.  He's good for about 50 pounds this year.  And all you can do is...  Sweet loss.  50 to 60 pounds.  Will you vomit it if you eat this way?  Like with a small stomach, you vomit.  Yeah, I think so.  This doesn't shrink your stomach, though.  No.  No.  But you can eat your way through those surgeries, right?  Yes.  There's guys that have had multiple.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Right?  You just hear it come out.  You hear the sound of Velcro in someone's stomach.  You're like, what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like when those submarine movies, when they're down too deep, and the ribbons start popping. 
[02:43:30]  There's a big sandwich coming down.  Yeah.  Pew.  Pew.  It's not as dangerous, either.  The lap band is not.  Yeah.  Not as dangerous.  Can they just go in and take it out if you want to?  Yeah.  He's got two and a half, three years.  They said the stomach could actually grow around it, too.  There are complications.  Oh, yeah.  He's absolutely doing this to make a presidential run.  Yeah.  He's got plenty of time. 
[02:44:00]  I mean.  No.  Yeah.  Sure, he's doing it for his family, but he's mostly doing it because he's got to look good  if he's making a run.  You can't be President Weeble.  You got to fucking lose some weight.  Yeah.  President fat fuck or something.  That too, Chippa.  Yeah.  Right?  Make a little something, right?  Yeah, yeah.  How much weight does he have to lose for you to consider him as a president?  As a president?  A hundred.  A hundred?  We like a healthy-looking president.  Yeah.  Clinton looked a little beefy before he started getting in. 
[02:44:30]  But never to the point where you're like, wow, Clinton's obese.  You know, that's fucking.  You forget.  He was a lot bigger.  That's taffed fat.  Well, yeah.  Like taffed.  Who was our fattest president?  I think it was taffed.  Was it taffed?  It has to be.  Yeah.  Or was it like Hayes or someone we don't remember how they look?  I don't know.  Fattest president.  Taft.  Taft.  Grover Cleveland.  Grover Cleveland?  How fat was taffed?  Taft was a fat fuck.  340 pounds. 
[02:45:00]  340.  340.  Christie has to weigh more than 340, right?  Yeah.  I'm getting a lap band.  They couldn't do that back then.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Only one out of 10 survived the operation.  Don't look now about us.  Yeah.  Taft is looking thin.  Ah.  I've started a step aerobic program.  Yes, I'm trying to lose the weight and be a slender, healthy president.  No need room.  They hated black people back then.  Let's go back to that other story. 
[02:45:30]  We go to Doug in Boston.  Doug.  Doug.  Yeah.  My first gig is a newscast director.  The first day I come in, here comes this six foot tall, just frightening looking woman.  And it turns out that it was Carrie, who used to be Gary, actually worked at...  I love how they make the names close.  Yeah.  Why would you just change it completely?  Yeah.  You could pick any name.  My name was Bob, and now I'm Cheryl.  Right.  Like, it doesn't have to be, I'm Bob.  Now I'm Bob-a-ra. 
[02:46:00]  Bob-a-ra.  Like, fucking Bobette.  You can fucking...  Believe me, you put on a wig and a dress and fucking stuff tits in there, you could go  off with the name.  We're not going to go, ew.  He didn't even keep a close name.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  The name's the easy part.  From Rob to Robin.  Yeah.  I was Rob.  You can pick any name.  Now I'm Roberta.  Oh, great.  It's actually easier if we don't...  If we're not reminded of the dude part of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Don.  You used to be Don.  Now you're Don. 
[02:46:30]  For Donna.  It's...  Yeah, Donna.  It's like, fuck that.  Anyway, go ahead, Doug.  All right.  So, actually, there's another thing, too.  In my town, I live in a real small town, there was an event at the school, and one of the  parents showed up, and his name was Bob, but he showed up in a blonde wig and a dress,  and his name now was Ariadne.  Oh, well, that's...  Oh, wow.  You're picking a good name.  Magical.  Ariadne?  Yes.  It's not a...  The beginning of that... 
[02:47:00]  The beginning part of that name is sexy, but then it tails off into almost a James Cagney  sound.  Ariadne.  Yeah, yeah.  But the crazy thing about Carrie was that she was a pre-op, so she was on all these hormones,  and, you know, TV's pretty high stress, and she would freak out.  I mean, throw shit around, break things.  You can't fucking get away with being a dude, dressing like a chick, and think we're going  to put up with the shit chick's pole.  Right.  Like that.  That crazy fucking psycho attitude. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  We just put up with it because we're hoping, you know, that we can fuck you.  Yeah.  If a guy is doing that, yeah, that's not going to wash here, fella.  No.  That's funny.  The last thing was, it's the station that, do you remember when you guys used to do the  lesbian dating game at AF?  Probably.  Right.  No, I'm trying to remember.  Well, sure.  So many memories.  Okay, so we had a reporter come over, and he was your best friend during the shoot.  Oh, that was... 
[02:48:00]  Afterwards, yeah, Bill Rapley.  I remember that.  Yeah, I was working there at the time, so that was...  I remember Bill.  He hung out with us for the day.  He had jeans and just, like, a T-shirt on with an earring.  Yeah, he had an earring.  And he's like, look, man, I'm one of you guys.  Hey, love the show.  Let's give me a positive piece.  This is going to be great.  Let me get some video of this over here.  We were so stupid and so green back then.  Oh, this is great.  Woo, woo, woo.  And then we see him on the news.  He's wearing a suit and tie.  No earring.  This will disgust you. 
[02:48:30]  What's your...  What's that?  Wait a minute, you motherfucker.  I couldn't believe it was the same guy.  He got us.  He infiltrated.  We really were.  Hilarious.  We were just very stupid back then.  We're still stupid, but we were really stupid back then.  Right.  I was on the station forever.  That was one of the best tapes.  If you could get a hold up to see the shit that was going on that day, that was pretty  good.  We were naive.  Yeah, there's some shit he filmed that day.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Have the naked girl sit on your lap.  Yeah.  We'll get a shot of that from behind and... 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  That was funny.  Oh, yeah.  They fucked us.  Did he become the chick?  We'll never know.  We'll never know.  I'm just going to guess.  No, he didn't.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  He didn't.  Hmm.  Wow.  So, good luck to Don, who's now Don, over there at ABC.  Yeah, I'm sure I'll wind up meeting her.  That one's still a rough one.  I'm in the news industry.  That's still a rough one to fucking digest, I've got to be honest with you. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  The other one's a strange one.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Guys are fucking weird.  Mother's Day.  Not many women pulling that shit.  It happens.  But not as often as the guys love putting on the wig and fucking strutting their ass and  shit out there.  You know.  What is that?  I don't know.  A lot of younger girls, though, are pulling this thing where they just completely go, 
[02:50:00]  dude.  Yeah.  Like these lesbians where they're overweight, tough, hat backwards.  They look like vatos fucking.  Yeah.  And that's like a whole thing.  There's no femininity.  Yeah.  Aren't those like diesel dykes?  That's pretty common.  It's the old diesel.  But it's newer.  They're getting younger and younger.  Right.  There's like this weird thing going on.  I don't know.  It's very accepted in school and shit like that.  And they look at guys like, what are you looking at?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't even see them as girls. 
[02:50:30]  They're very.  As human beings, we're going to stare at that shit.  I know.  It's natural.  They get mad.  It's like, I'm sorry.  It's something I don't see every day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't get pissed at me because you're a fucking freak show walking around.  I'm not used to this shit.  Right.  I was raised in a normal household, you freak.  There's a guy.  Give me a minute.  This guy is probably pushing 60 on the Upper West Side.  And he dresses like a girl, like old school from like, I would say like the 30s or 40s. 
[02:51:00]  He wears one of those lady fezes.  What?  Is it called the fez, the hat?  You're mentioning who's coming up.  No, I understand.  That's why I was being careful.  What is it called, though?  Is it called the fez hat?  Is it a fez hat?  Yeah.  No, it's a hey buddy.  It's a hey buddy hat.  And he walks around with high heels and stuff.  I want to get him on film so bad.  Wait, the thing with the tassel that the Shriners wear?  Yeah, but it doesn't have the tassel, but it has that type of look to it.  Oh, right.  Like an old school hat from like the 30s. 
[02:51:30]  Like one that Lucy would wear?  Sure, yeah.  Lucy was always coming in with those dumb hats.  And it wasn't even a hat.  It was just something you pinned on the side of your big hairdo.  This guy walks around the Upper West Side, high heels.  Yeah.  And he goes through life as a woman.  I want to get him on video so bad.  But I know he would kick my fucking ass if I was caught.  Old guy dressed as a chick?  He's in shape.  Is he in heels?  He's in shape.  Yeah.  You could outrun him.  But he walks around in an attitude.  Like he knows everyone's looking and he gets pissed off. 
[02:52:00]  Like, what are you looking at?  That is so weird.  And I want to get him on film so bad.  But I know if it goes wrong, I'll get my ass kicked.  I know it.  I can sit here and act like a tough guy.  You could outrun him.  He's in heels.  You know what you got to do?  And I just picked these up.  And I'm not even kidding.  I just picked them up.  I saw them.  I had to buy them.  What?  The fucking glasses with the camera in them.  What?  The Google?  No.  Just, I got a pair of glasses.  Oh, yeah.  Put them on.  And it's got HD fucking vid.  16 gigabyte fucking card in there.  And you can just put them on. 
[02:52:30]  And as you walk, you're just videoing.  What do they look like, though?  They look like dumb fucking glasses.  But big?  No.  They're kind of little fucking little.  You can't see a camera?  No.  Give me a picture of what they look like.  Just walk around.  I don't know.  There's so many different brands.  Oh, yeah.  They look like Jose Canseco fucking sunglasses.  They can.  But mine look a little different.  Mine will look more like just nerdy glasses.  Well, I got a Bluetooth, you know, but I got it too late.  I got a Bluetooth camera.  Do you?  Yeah, but no one fucking walks around with Bluetooth.  With blue teeth.  With blue teeth anymore. 
[02:53:00]  They clean that shit.  Yeah, more like that kind of.  Yeah, more like that.  Just regular glasses.  That doesn't look that bad.  Yeah.  Regular glasses.  And, you know.  How's the video?  It's pretty good.  Yeah.  It's fucking, you know.  How do you turn it on?  You grab the little thing that goes over your right ear.  Do you?  Yeah.  And you press the button on top.  Can you have, like, earplugs to hear the audio?  I don't think so.  You're hearing the audio because you're there.  No, I know, but.  It's all that other noise that you don't realize.  Can you see?  Does it have a viewfinder?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  But you know all that other noise you don't even realize is happening until you fucking 
[02:53:30]  look at your video and go, really?  There was a fire truck going by?  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I was on a cruise ship leaving port.  Yeah.  Our ears are an amazing thing.  They filter out all that other shit.  Like this show.  This little poor listener.  Yeah, so I got one of those because I figured it would kind of be fun to fuck with some  people in certain circumstances.  What are you thinking?  I don't know.  Stores.  People behind the counter. 
[02:54:00]  Right.  Saying fucking things.  Getting into protracted conversations with a pharmacist.  Suddenly you're Howie Mandel.  Just shit.  Yes, exactly.  Don't touch me.  I got backup.  Yeah?  Rosalie from New York City.  Don't say where the guy works, but you know the exact guy I'm talking about, right?  Yeah, he works.  Huh?  I know the exact guy, yes.  And it's like a fez type hat, or I can't explain it.  It's like an old school hat.  Where does he work?  He always has like these pearl type earrings on, too. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  He's always wearing these big old lady-ish type pearl earrings.  Oh, I know that guy.  Costume jewelry.  You've seen him, too?  Yeah, he works at the diner.  He's scary, right, Rosalie?  He's unique.  What kind of hat is it?  Very intimidating, but he's very, very sure of himself.  Tell me about the hat.  What kind of hat?  No, it's definitely a fez-looking type hat.  Is it a pillbox?  It looks like a fez hat. 
[02:55:00]  Like put fez in Google image, fez hat or something.  But I know what a fez hat is.  But it's smaller.  It's like a designer type pillbox, like Jackie O.  No.  No?  Smaller.  No, no, no.  She had grace, Jackie O.  It had like a small little veil.  It's like that type.  A veil?  See the fez hat?  It's more like a 1930s.  Take the tassel off and make it shorter.  All right.  1930s woman's hat.  Yeah.  It's almost pillbox-ish.  Almost.  Wow.  Now I know where he works.  What about the dress? 
[02:55:30]  Is the dress 30s style?  Sort of.  Yeah?  It's usually long past, like a little past the knees.  Oh.  It definitely wears-  Not giving up too much.  That's nice.  Nice.  Leaving a little to the imagination.  Classy.  Yeah.  Rosalie knows.  I see him almost every day.  Wow.  Does he make eye contact with you?  No.  He's always just going to work.  Right.  I see him crossing the street, going to work. 
[02:56:00]  And he's just very, I guess, comfortable in his own-  Third pick-in.  He's extremely comfortable.  He's very sure of himself.  How old is he?  We all should have that type of confidence.  That chick is sexy.  I think he's like mid-50s, would you say?  Upper 50s?  Right.  I would say upper 50s.  Yeah.  Definitely upper 50s.  There you go.  It's got to be the guy.  Somebody's grandpa.  It's the earrings that get me every time.  You know, like when you look-  Oh, and he keeps his hair short, too.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  He wears like old earrings. 
[02:56:30]  Do they stretch?  Are his earlobes all stretched out like grandma's?  Oh, grandma.  There's nothing worse than watching grandma with those fucking lead weights.  Fishing weights on her ears.  Maybe you ought to lighten the load on those lobes, granny.  Because they're fucking stretching down like some you bangy fucking tribe.  Lips.  Yeah, you just see them.  And they're like at the brink.  They're pulling the fucking piercing holes. 
[02:57:00]  The holes look like slits.  Little hound dog ears.  Terrible.  Yeah, Rosalie's on it.  It's asking a lot of people to just accept it.  It really is.  You've got to at least give us a beat.  You've got to give you, all right, you're shocked for a second, and then we'll get used  to it.  Let me get it out.  Okay, now I'm with you, Carl.  Let me get out the laughter, the shock, the fucking, oh my God, the jizz.  The quick, yeah, the calm, the quick moment of, what the fuck are you doing? 
[02:57:30]  Right.  Yeah, can you at least give us that?  Yeah.  And then we'll work on the inclusion.  The tolerance.  Tolerance, diversity, all that happy work shit.  Some people saying things they shouldn't say.  Say, everybody, that lady has a pecker.  Chip, huh?  Chip would have so many lawsuits if he was in the workplace.  Will it work?  When Dawn walks in.  Mr. Chipperson, good to see you in my courtroom again.  What is it this time, counsel?  I just said, hey, that lady's not a real lady. 
[02:58:00]  It's a guy with a bunch of stuff up in his shirt.  All right.  20,000 in damages.  You just look at a fucking scale on the wall.  Yeah.  He argues with somebody who's transgendered at work.  Why don't you go suck a bunch of peckers or something?  All right.  Here's a subpoena.  We'll see you in court.  See you next week.  Chip just doesn't know what to do.  Fuck.  Look at that.  No way a faggot could lift that.  Exactly.  Right, Chip.  Yeah.  There we go, Chip. 
[02:58:30]  Hey, don't your wrist bend or something?  No.  Hey, what are you going to do?  Go home and smell some pecker juice?  Oh, my God.  No.  I didn't give the promotion to the black guy.  He's black.  Oh, Chip.  Exactly.  Why don't you eat some chicken or something?  Oh, no.  Oh, Chip again.  Pulling up to the court building.  Yeah.  Hey, you Chinese.  Look at your eyes.  Oh, jeez.  Welcome to the job or something.  And he just wouldn't learn.  Yeah.  There's no teaching. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, what are you going to go to the bathroom and look for your little pecker or something?  They do learning videos on chicks and snakes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pull up a nice ass.  Like a lot of sexual harassment.  Yeah, pretty girls.  Thinking that the girl would be, like, flattered.  Yeah.  Hey, look at your fucking nipples is showing.  You got me creaming in my pants.  Thinking it's a compliment.  Yeah, it's a compliment.  What's the matter?  I was complimenting.  I'd fucking cream all over your hand if you grabbed it.  Oh, jeez.  You should get a raise, like, in the fuck in front of my pants. 
[02:59:30]  Holy shit.  Chip doesn't know.  He just doesn't know.  Back to human resources.  Yes, yes.  HR again.  Sit down, Mr. Chip.  Six is tongue on it, girls.  I'll fucking make you clip dance.  Chip.  Chip, can we talk to you again?  Yeah, Chip.  What the fuck?  Don't make no sense.  Wow.  Before we leave you today. 
[03:00:00]  They love me.  Kingston Pete on the Twitter.  No human remains found at Cleveland home of Ariel Castro.  Wow.  They were searching for human remains.  They did not find anything.  Send the goose in there.  He'll come out with something.  Oh, the goose.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Sniff it out.  For N16.  Goose wouldn't fucking respect a crime scene, though.  No little booties.  There's no fucking, like, you're picking shit up with your hands.  My little girl's little booty needs surgery.  I thought it was the front. 
[03:00:30]  It is.  But the front is sideways, so it all drips into the little booty.  The long flaps.  Her little booty is chafed.  He's doing it all for his little girl.  Planting evidence.  Whatever it takes to get the bad guy.  Old school.  Yeah, old school.  Fucking, you got a lay down gun.  You got one of those fucking guns.  At any moment's notice, you could just throw it down.  Yeah, he was shooting back.  Just don't pull a gun.  Yeah.  Throw down.  No, the Goose don't do that.  Oh, oh. 
[03:01:00]  But that goes with the toughest nails.  Yeah.  He bends the rules, but he doesn't break them.  Yeah.  Oh, is that it?  He might bend a few rules.  Yeah, I do what I gotta do in the system, but I'm not gonna throw a fake gun in there  and muck up the works.  Oh, muck up the works.  I might dent up your rules a bit.  Do you think that's a good thing, muck up the works?  Good thing?  It's the dumbest, like, catchphrase-y, gimmicky thing that any character could say.  Hey, he's mucking up the works.  Oh, and then people, like, because you'd be an actor, of course, and people would see 
[03:01:30]  you on the street, and they'd be like, hey, hey, Jenkins, hey, who's mucking up the  works?  They'd yell out the catchphrase.  Yeah.  You'd be like, all right.  It's a character.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mucking it up.  Mucking up the works t-shirts.  Oh, man.  Don't muck up the works.  And it's a picture of Jenkins on a t-shirt.  Oh, I'd wear that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you muck up the works, I'll unmuck them for you.  It doesn't even roll off the tongue very nicely. 
[03:02:00]  It's a horrible phrase.  It doesn't catch at all.  It just keeps saying it over and over.  No.  It tries to really pound it into people's heads.  Aren't you a guy from that show?  Yeah, the mucking up the works.  Oh, God.  No.  No.  He then literally, like, his drain is clogged, and he calls a plumber, and the plumber's  like, well, the hair is mucking up the works.  And it's literal, and he gets mad that he's using it, but he has more right to use mucking  up the works.  That's mine.  It's mine.  What? 
[03:02:30]  All right.  It's plug time.  Oh.  Plug it, baby.  Yeah.  Got the Tom Popper in Philly this weekend.  Yes.  Ooh.  Can't wait.  Philadelphia, one show.  Where are you working?

I try not to eat these diet bars because they're all sugar, but she said this one is not bad. 
[03:06:00]  It's called Go Free, and it's a gluten-free dark chocolate trail mix.  I only had half of the bar.  She said it's like 170 calories.  I'm wondering if that's bad.  It's going to make you shit, though.  I don't care.  I try not to eat these things, though, because usually they're just sugar, and they're just basically like candy bars.  So I'm just starving.  I get nauseous sometimes.  I drink too much coffee.  But you eat a lot during the show.  I mean, it's good stuff, but you eat a lot during the show.  Well, in four hours, I eat egg whites, scrambled egg white. 
[03:06:30]  I mean, egg white omelet with, like, you know, tomatoes and stuff and some vegetables in it.  And then I have some fat-free plain yogurt with blueberries and strawberries.  And people will be like, they have sugar, but I don't care.  They're cancer.  And sometimes you have oatmeal, too, right?  Very occasionally.  A little bit of carbs, yeah.  Let's see.  Andrew in New York.  Cousins slept with your girlfriend behind your back.  I love everyone in this story so far.  Hi, Jim.  Big fan.  Hi, buddy.  Thank you.  Last summer, I was seeing this girl who ended up sleeping with my cousin behind my back. 
[03:07:00]  These eight months have passed by, and they're in love and getting married soon.  Wow.  My cousin called me to be a groomsman, but I don't want any part of the wedding because I  can't look at that jizz bag for more than three seconds.  How long did you date her for?  Me and her were like on and off for about like three months.  Very casual, like no strength attached.  But the whole thing is like, the reason why he, like, I'm sorry. 
[03:07:30]  I just got people talking.  All right.  I don't know.  It just bothered me that I lost in trust, you know?  Yeah, I don't blame you.  I mean, he did it behind your back, even though you two weren't in love.  Still, it's kind of sneaky and shitty to do.  But are you going to have to see him for the rest of your life, or do you not have to interact  with him?  No, yeah.  I'm going to be interacting with him for a lot of time. 
[03:08:00]  I see him all the time.  It's just now the big issue is he wants me at his wedding, and I said no.  So, well, now, that's a tough call, because if you're going to have to see him and his  family, if you want to hold on to the resentment, then hold on to it.  But there might come a point where you're going to have to move on or just have an uncomfortable  family relationship.  Yeah.  I mean, I've kind of gotten past, like, holding a grudge against him.  It's just I can't stand her. 
[03:08:30]  You know, I can't be in a room with her for more than three seconds.  I just, I detest her.  And, like, now, I mean, like, the family's, like, 50-50 on it.  Like, I have people that tell me I should go to the wedding, and I should just, like,  quit being a baby and just, like, let it go.  I don't think you're being a baby.  Yeah, I thank you, because, like, everybody else is, like, quick to say, oh, you know,  you shouldn't be overreacting if there's no strength attached.  Like, the biggest thing is that I lost his trust, and me and him were really close before. 
[03:09:00]  You know what?  This one might be very simple.  If you want to go, go.  And if you don't, don't.  Like, it really is that simple.  Who cares what anybody else says?  Fuck the family.  Fuck me.  If you feel like, hey, man, I can kind of move past this right now.  I'm going to go, go.  But if not, then fuck both of them.  Don't go.  You know what I mean?  They did shit behind your back.  It was sneaky.  And now just because they're getting married doesn't mean that you have to co-sign them  sneaking around behind your back.  Exactly. 
[03:09:30]  And you know what the funny thing is?  Is he revealed it at my brother's birthday party.  And the funny thing is, two weeks before, I was with her.  And I told her I would be a very transparent guy, that if I wanted to be with somebody else,  I'd do it.  And I expected the same from her.  And both of them get to the party, and they don't say shit to me.  Like, the whole time, they're very sneaky.  Yeah.  And like, five hours into the party, my cousin's like, yeah, I want to talk to you.  So, you know, I kind of smelled the rat. 
[03:10:00]  So then when he told me, I kind of thought, all right, you know, it's not a problem.  But I didn't think they were going to get married, you know?  All right.  Well, there's nothing.  I mean, look, dude, thank you very much for the call.  Thank you very much, Andrew.  I will say that, you know, you got to do what you feel right doing.  And it's just going to be, you're either going to want to or you're not.  But if you really feel resentment and you don't want to look at her, then fuck them.  Don't honor them by going to your wedding.  You don't have to.  You don't have to go to a wedding just because it's family.  Oh, it's your family. 
[03:10:30]  Well, fuck them.  Then he should have thought of that before he fucked the girl you were dating.  And if it happened to work out where they are in love and they were meant to be, that's okay.  But they didn't go about it the right way.  So maybe their punishment should be, you don't show up at their shitty wedding.  So let's talk about, we have a couple of CPAP questions.  And let's talk to Tim in Virginia, who has a CPAP question.  Yeah, how are you doing, Jeff?  Hi, buddy.  Well, I have a CPAP.  And I just spent the night at a girl's house. 
[03:11:00]  And I didn't bring it in.  I didn't bring it with me because I was a few hours away from home.  And I was afraid to go to sleep.  So I had to set up all night watching really bad television to keep on going to sleep.  What do I do?  You bring the machine.  Like, I understand, like, I have the same fear of falling asleep.  But, because, you know, a lot of times, like last night I had a bad night. 
[03:11:30]  I'm very tired today.  My central apnea was killing me.  Like, I just kept waking up.  So I was having a fucking, a very frustrating night.  So I understand that fear of going to sleep.  But if you didn't have the machine with you because you just didn't have it, that's one thing.  But if you left it home because you were socially embarrassed.  Right.  Which was it?  I was embarrassed.  All right.  Well, then don't be embarrassed anymore.  Tell her beforehand, hey, look, I used this machine because without it I might die. 
[03:12:00]  And if she can't deal with that, then fuck her.  But chances are most women are fine with that, dude.  Like, you know what?  It's after you're fucked.  You put it on.  You go to sleep.  You don't have to, you know, it's like you don't do anything while you're sleeping.  So never be embarrassed again or make the priority pick.  You being asleep and comfortable is more important than what a broad is going to think of you.  And chances are it's not going to be as bad as you think. 
[03:12:30]  Right.  So that was silly to be embarrassed, dude.  Don't be like that anymore.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  I appreciate it, man.  Good luck.  Now, Tucker in Fort Worth has, uh, Apnea.  Yes, Tucker?  Hey, Jim.  Actually, yeah, I'm 32.  I just got a CPAP machine and I am having hell with these masks.  And as I recall, I remember you talking on the show that you'd had trouble finding one that fit.  And I was wondering if you had any tips.  I've got the full face mask now.  I end up drooling in it and then it leaks and I wake myself up and I don't know what. 
[03:13:00]  How long have you had it?  I've had it for about two weeks and I've only, I wake up with it off for like half that time.  You're brand new.  It could take six months.  And I'm not saying that for me, it's been a year, but I don't have the right machine.  And, uh, you know, I, I, the doctors, the situation with the sleep center I've dealt with has not been good.  And it's been extraordinarily frustrating.  And I really do want to go on the air and tell you which one they are.  Um, and, and again, I would only say that my experience with them was extraordinarily unsatisfying. 
[03:13:30]  Uh, but two weeks out from what people I know who have learned to use the masks, two weeks is very new.  Keep giving it time.  You'll find the mask that works for you.  If this one doesn't, there's also custom fitted mask, which I would like to investigate where you can, they're expensive, but you can have a mask made for your face.  But don't give up.  You just started eventually from what they tell me, it will change your life.  And I'm, I, I hold on to that. 
[03:14:00]  And, you know, you know, when Doug was in there, we talked about God and, you know, I don't know how I feel about God.  I go back and forth.  I want to believe.  And thank you very much for the call, uh, Tucker, I would suggest just continue to try, but you know, it's like, I really do want to believe in God, but it's really hard to.  And then when I do believe in God, I fucking hate his guts because it's like, I have a great life, but it's like, you know,  I can't even go to sleep without fucking dreading it.  Um, you know, I just want to lay down and go to sleep and I can't. 
[03:14:30]  So there's all, you just do the right thing.  So I do the right thing and I do the right thing and it doesn't matter.  It's still not working.  So that makes me just angry.  Maybe if it's not God, it's just the universe or my own fucking face.  Yes.  Did you ever, I know you, you doing the CPAP and all that stuff, but did you ever try something as simple as the, the thing that dentists can make where they use just to move your jaw?  Maybe that's just something that simple.  I slept with one last night.  I sleep with one every night.  It's a mouth guard.  It pushes your jaw forward, but, and I'll be very brief with this, but I have what they call complex apnea, which is CPAP, uh, constant positive airway pressure. 
[03:15:00]  I think it's helps, uh, regular apnea, which is, uh, which, uh, the physical apnea is when your tongue blocks.  And that's what the jaw push forward mouth guard does.  If you just snore, a mouth guard might work for you because when it pushes your jaw forward, it gives you a little more room in the throat for the air to go through.  And it helps.  But, uh, the central apnea, that doesn't help because it has nothing to do with my tongue.  It's the brain signal.  So they get, the CPAP does not work for that because when I just stop, like when you're going and you're trying to breathe, the machine senses that you're trying to breathe and forces air in. 
[03:15:30]  Or it just constantly forces air in.  Um, when I have, uh, you know, which is what CPAP and BiPAP do, but I don't need those because when I don't breathe, when I just go, and I just stop, there's no effort to breathe because my cunt brain doesn't send the signal.  The machine doesn't pick up that that's happening.  So I just go, and I wake up gasping in a mask.  It's a fucking abomination. 
[03:16:00]  And I told these fucking faggot doctors, it's central fucking complex apnea, dummies.  And this, this fucking, I'll never forget these techs.  The two sleep studies I did, they're all dopes.  The one tech tells me, I don't even think you have sleep apnea.  And then the next time I come back, I'm like, I want to be tested on a fucking ASV machine, which is the one that, that's very expensive, but it senses when you're not breathing and it deals with complex apnea.  And the fucking female tech comes in and goes, no, you don't need that. 
[03:16:30]  Like, that breathes for you.  And it's like, well, that's what I need, stupid.  Why am I yelling?  I'm sorry.  I just get angry every time I think of these fucking people.  And to answer the guy from Richmond, John, I know I didn't have the surgery, but again, that's what they put in those pillars in the back of your throat.  I've had the sinus surgery, but that won't help me because, again, it's complex apnea.  Let's see.  Brian in Washington State, separated from his wife.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, Jim, how's it going?  I'm okay, buddy.  I'm a little cranky because I'm so tired, but thank you.  How are you? 
[03:17:00]  Okay, I'm doing great.  I love you on red eye.  Thank you, buddy.  Every time I hear you on OPA, I think you're great.  Thank you.  So I figured who better to call, right, than my question.  So here's the deal.  My wife and I were separated for a while, like, say, six months.  Didn't really talk, and it was really bad because she used to be my best friend.  We would get along, but we suddenly didn't, and horrible fighting all the time.  Couldn't go two words without fighting.  So I move out, and she started seeing some other, some guy.  Good guy.  He's friends with me on Facebook. 
[03:17:30]  So I started seeing him, and I don't know why it was bugging me because it shouldn't have bugged me.  Sure, it shouldn't have.  It's normal.  Wait, you knew the guy or you didn't know him?  Oh, I didn't know him.  I knew him.  Yeah, of course it would bother you.  Why shouldn't it?  We're not robots, even though, oh, I mean, you shouldn't go over there with a fucking butcher knife.  You shouldn't act on it.  But, yeah, of course, bothering you is pretty normal for a while.  If it's been 10 years, maybe not, but, you know, that's normal.  Well, it was kind of bothering me anyway, and so I was talking with some friends at dinner, 
[03:18:00]  and, you know, I was trying to go out there and date and see what's out there,  but I wasn't really interested.  So it came down to one day I'm having an interview with, I'm having dinner with some friends,  and I'm talking to this guy's wife who's kind of a counselor, and she says,  well, Brian, you know, I think it's because you're still in love with her.  And I said, well, yeah, of course I'm still in love with her.  Sure.  So then I said, okay, from this day forward, I'm not going to fight with her.  I'm not going to disrespect her.  I'm not going to yell.  I just want to get along.  We have kids, so forth and so on. 
[03:18:30]  So I write her an email and just say, look, I'm sorry I didn't think you're right.  Blah, blah, blah.  It went on.  I just, you know, I wasn't trying to break them up or anything.  Right.  So then we go over to the house, and then we have sex.  Like, she wants to have sex with me.  Okay.  And we've always had great sex.  Like, I mean, I love the woman.  She's, you know, sensual.  Anyway, so the bottom line is, here's my problem.  So she still wants to see this other guy.  Not date.  She says she's not going to sleep with him anymore.  But, you know, it's like little texts once in a while. 
[03:19:00]  You know what, dude?  I'm not checking the text like some psychopath.  I never checked her text.  I'm not, I'm not, I've never been married, and I say this every time, but fuck her.  Like, unless, unless one of two things, one of two things is happening.  Either she just wants what she wants, and that's it.  Or she really loves you, but doesn't trust that you're going to change if you need to change.  Or doesn't trust that the relationship will work, so she's keeping this little light bridge back to this guy.  How old is she? 
[03:19:30]  40.  Yeah, 40.  Okay.  So at 40, you have kids?  Yeah, three.  Okay.  So it's a lot harder for a 40-year-old woman with kids to find a guy than it is for a 40-year-old man to find a woman.  Because that's a lot of baggage for a guy to take on as a woman with kids.  So the fact that she has another guy, it's probably, you know, and one of the things that you don't work out, then she's left with nothing.  So maybe she wants you, but is keeping a little hook into him just as a safety line for a little while. 
[03:20:00]  How long have you been fucking her again?  Oh, it's been going on for like a month.  Yeah, a month.  I shit you not, I shit you not, Tim, it's been probably another 30 days.  Maybe 24.  Okay, so maybe you're the, how long was she with him?  So like three months.  Yeah.  Dude, I wouldn't, I mean, you know what, I would say give her a break on this one for a little while.  It's only a month.  Do you, does she look like she wants to get back with you?  Oh, I'd say, I'm pretty, she said it. 
[03:20:30]  I guess what's bothering me, Jim, is that I know I have no right to tell her to stop seeing the guy.  I don't, because we were pretty much on our way to divorce court.  So what you do, dude, is keep fucking her right and treat her right.  And if she's treating you right, she probably won't want to see him after a short amount of time.  Most of her wanting to see him, you're the father of her kids.  You're putting good dick to her.  It literally is probably just a safety line.  So if all of a sudden she found a guy who will tolerate a 40-year-old woman with three kids, 
[03:21:00]  let's just say you fuck her for two months and then get bored and take off again or act like a dick,  then she's got nothing.  So I think if she realizes things that you might work out, she might let this other guy go, okay?  All right, that makes sense.  Thank you, buddy.  Good luck to you.  Henry in Jacksonville says he has something to share about CPAP.  Oh!  Yes, Henry.  Hello?  Yes, we lost him.  Did we lose?  Oh, God, I hope his CPAP didn't shut off.  He's dead!  Now Dave in New Mexico wants to know how I lost the weight. 
[03:21:30]  Hey, what's going on, Jim?  Dave, you want to know how I lost the weight?  Well, yeah, the only reason why I ask is because, you know,  I heard you mention on the show one day you're about 5'6", and you were up like at 185.  I'm, you know, I was, I'm close to, first of all, closer to 5'7".  And I got to 181 a few years ago, but I was tapping out at about 165.  170 was my average weight for the last couple of years.  See, I fluctuate between 178 and 190. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  And I'm sick, tired of this fucking yo-yo.  It depresses me.  I'll tell you.  And I worked out, working out, it's the diet part.  It's all diet, dude.  It's, dude, it's, I apologize for the interrupting you, but it's all diet.  You know what I mean?  It's like everyone says that exercise is important, but it's, it's 80% diet.  You know, what I do is you can go online and find some great workouts, but I was mixing it up.  I was going almost every day, a little bit of cardio, doing some weights and not expecting instant results. 
[03:22:30]  You know, I, I, my diet is in the, in the morning, I, and again, I'm lucky because I have a pretty regimented schedule as far as doing, performing.  In the morning, I eat egg white omelet with no meat in it, just like, you know, some, you know, you know, what I guess said, green peppers, red peppers, tomatoes, whatever.  And then I'll have some, like, uh, fat-free yogurt with, uh, uh, fruit of some sort.  In the afternoon, maybe I'll eat some grilled chicken or some salmon or some tilapia with some steamed vegetables that I eat at the gym. 
[03:23:00]  They have a good little place to eat there.  And then at night, I eat tabbouleh salad, which is like a lot of parsley and stuff, and I, and I have it with, uh, with a couple of olives and a skewer of grilled chicken.  So, I'm, and I eat a lot of sushi more than I should.  That's the one bit of rice I get that I shouldn't have.  Um, but, you know, my whole, my whole thing is kind of like, uh, I think I'm a food addict.  You might be.  I mean, that's a tough addiction. 
[03:23:30]  That's a very tough addiction, food.  So why don't you try this?  Why, there are 12-step meetings for food.  There's Overeaters Anonymous and these other programs.  Why don't you try one of those for a little while and see if it resonates with you?  I will.  I'll do so.  And then make yourself go to the gym, too, dude.  I know none of us want to, because we go to the gym, we look in the mirror.  What's that?  That's not the issue.  The gym's not the food.  Okay.  It's just, I feel like, it's like, oh, I should reward myself.  I do it, please.  I've been doing good for two weeks.  I know.  I'm going to reward myself, and then I get in that cycle of eating like shit, you know? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, dude, it's a very cunning and powerful and baffling thing, the way our mind talks to us.  I was doing the same thing.  I'll reward myself.  But now when I reward myself, like if I'm going to Anthony's, like on Christmas I went  over there, or if I'm going to Bob Kelly's on Thanksgiving, you know what?  I've been eating so good for like a year now or eight months.  Like, rewarding myself literally is one night.  I don't reward myself two or three nights.  Or if I'm out and I have some fruit for dessert, like I'll have, and we're going to let you go  because your phone keeps cracking, but thank you. 
[03:24:30]  I'll have some like fruit for dessert, like berries, and a little bit of whipped cream  I'll dip it into.  I just got to stop bullshitting myself.  I can't eat candy and fucking cake and mayonnaise and fattening food.  It's like, that's why I put weight on.  So good luck, buddy.  Okay, let's see, let me see what this guy is, let's see, Psycho Bob from Baltimore.  Hey, Jimmy, how are you doing?  Hi, Bob, how are you?  Good, two things. 
[03:25:00]  First thing is, I had sleep apnea, I ignored it for years, and finally got a machine, first  night, worked perfectly, haven't had a problem since then.  It's been like five years since I had it.  I envy you.  So you're probably a guy that fell asleep well, too.  I'm a guy that, A, can't fall asleep, and then I don't sleep once, I am asleep.  But I really envy that, but I'm happy to hear that.  I was lucky.  I was really lucky.  Second thing is, a couple months ago, you made a comment on the show, and usually, you 
[03:25:30]  know, like you're real funny when you come up with serious stuff, and it really hit me  at home, and I wanted to mention it to you, was you were talking about religion, and you  said that you believed in God, not really organized religion, but that you believed in God  because if there wasn't a God, then once we die, we cease to exist.  That really hit it on the head for me.  I was saying, I think I was saying why I want to believe in a God, like, meaning, why is  it important for me to believe in a God?  I think that's what Penn Jillette was in.  And I think I was saying, like, why I want to believe. 
[03:26:00]  I want to believe that it's true, and I really do want to believe that it's true, and I think  he was saying why.  Like, he was quoting Christopher Hitchens, saying that God is punishing, and God is  awful, and why do we need to believe?  And I was saying, like, well, that's a good question.  Here's why I want to believe.  And again, it's hard, so I don't know if I do or not.  I'm up in the air.  Well, we won't know the answer.  We won't ever know the answer until we get to that point, but I like the philosophy, and I  appreciated hearing it.  Thank you, buddy, but for me, that's why I just don't want to cease to exist.  I want to continue in some form, and that's all technology is about. 
[03:26:30]  That's all we are about as a species, and thank you for the call, Bob, is trying to continue  to exist, to stretch life, not just to endure life and to have a life, but to stretch it.  We want to exist, and that's probably, if God is a man-made creation, that's probably  what it is.  That's probably human beings creating a way where we continue to exist until the technology  will actually allow us to exist forever, which I firmly believe it will. 
[03:27:00]  Now, let me ask, John, Louisiana's tilapia is really bad for you, man.  Let me hear this.  John, why do you say that?  Yeah, let's jump right from God to bad fish.  How you doing?  Hey, buddy.  Look, yeah, I want to discourage you and the listeners from tilapia, because it's been,  it was good whenever it was wild-caught, but now they're farm-raising it, kind of like  they've done with catfish, but they genetically modified tilapia.  They found the males grow faster whenever, than the females.  They found that they added testosterone to the feed. 
[03:27:30]  All the fish turn into males, so they're genetically modifying the feed.  Plus, it's corn and all this stuff that creates these omega-6 acids in the fish, which  omega-6s aren't good for you.  Tilapia is really bad for you, and you can look all this stuff up.  It's all the research I've talked about.  Okay, I believe it.  It's not good.  Anyways, but on the good stuff.  Hey, are you going to go to Bonnaroo this year?  Thank you very much for the call.  No, I will not be going to Bonnaroo.  They haven't invited me, but maybe next year.  Every few years, you get the call from them.  And thanks for the information on the tilapia. 
[03:28:00]  In my gym, there's a few options.  It's like, you know, there's good salmon, and then there's some grilled chicken, and there's  tilapia, the three main ones.  But now I'll kind of, I eat tilapia, honestly, probably once a week.  It's usually chicken or salmon, but now I'll lay off that.  So thank you very much.  Now, Susan in Pennsylvania wants to know if she should stay with her boyfriend because  of their financial situation.  Ooh, do tell, Sue.  Well, I mean, when I first started dating my boyfriend, we were, you know, 19 years old. 
[03:28:30]  And I don't think I really realized, you know, the implications of him being disabled and  legally blind.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  And the fact that he was on a Social Security disability.  Okay.  And unfortunately, they kicked him off of it because despite his efforts, that like, he  tried to make sure that like he was under the amount that he could actually make.  And I guess he ended up making too much, despite the fact that he called Social Security a number 
[03:29:00]  of times.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So what's your dilemma now?  You're with this guy for how long?  10 years.  Oh, wow.  Quite a while.  Now, do you love him?  Yeah, I do love him.  But it's just like he, at the moment, he owes the government like $40,000.  He works like 60 hours a week.  So like I rarely, if ever see him.  What does he do?  He is in the IT field.  Is he blind? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  What's he do?  You can be legally blind, but still be able to see.  Oh, okay.  Can't drive.  Sure, okay.  So he makes money, but now you love him.  He makes money.  What's the issue?  I mean, the fact that he has like $40,000, we barely are able to like, you know, keep  our heads afloat, you know, to like sustain.  You're 19 when you met this guy.  You're probably tired of fucking the same guy. 
[03:30:00]  Are you bored with him?  No, I'm not bored with him.  I mean, I love him a lot.  I think he's a great guy.  It just, like, it doesn't feel like you're in a relationship when, like, he's not, you  know, he's not able to be there for me as much as he would like to be.  Well, is it because he's just working a lot?  It's because he's working a lot, but also because, like I said, he owes the government  $40,000.  He's got student loans.  He's got credit card debt from buying things that we absolutely, necessities for our home, 
[03:30:30]  like a refrigerator, stove, that kind of shit.  Okay, so why would you think of leaving him?  Just because he's been really busy trying to pay off stuff responsibly.  Like, I think he's probably, he guy's busting his ass.  Like, if he was working 10 hours a week, he'd be able to phone call and be, and he doesn't  do anything, and we got debt, but he won't pay it off, and he's lazy, and he's sleeping  all day, and I can't, I'm sick of looking at him.  It's like there's, I've had this fight with girlfriends before.  There's never a happy medium. 
[03:31:00]  Like, they want you to work 40 hours a week, or the exact amount of hours you need to pay  for everything comfortably, and enough time to give them exactly what they need, but sweetheart,  that's not always possible.  Like, you know, in an ideal world, but if he's paying off stuff, let him work the extra  hours and pay it off all he can.  Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm trying to do, it's just like, you know, he doesn't make that  much, so like, it's like, difficult to imagine, like, you know, will we be able to save for 
[03:31:30]  the future, will we be able to...  What do you do?  What kind of work do you do?  I'm, unfortunately, I, I was a student, but I was suffering from anxiety issues from my  past that I'm trying to sort out at the moment.  So you're not working, right?  You're not working.  No, I'm not.  Okay, so here you are.  This guy's busting his ass for 60 hours a week, with his shitty eyesight and his dumb face  pressed up against the computer, it's probably really uncomfortable to look at, and you're  not working? 
[03:32:00]  Like, like, I don't care why.  You can't, even though, he, this guy can't see for shit, like, he probably doesn't see  a basketball until it's bouncing off his forehead, and you, you are figuring out why  you can't work.  How about you get a job?  A, you will not have nearly as much time to think about how your needs are not being  met, and you won't have enough time to think about, he's not available for me.  You need him to be available for you, because you have so much time on your hands.  Why don't you go out and get a 40-hour-a-week job? 
[03:32:30]  A, you won't have as much time on your hands.  B, you'll empathize.  Go ahead.  I have tried in the past to, like, get jobs, and I have worked.  It's not like I have constantly, perpetually sat on my ass, which I do feel guilty about.  I really do.  How long have you been sitting on your ass?  A couple months.  Okay.  Why aren't you working 40 hours a week and contributing to the pot?  That's kind of also my dilemma, is, like, the only job that I can obtain, because I 
[03:33:00]  don't really have anything past a high school education, is, like, minimum wage-paying jobs,  and maybe that's fucking selfish of me.  I'm, you know, it feels pretty selfish of me, but it's, like, it's really difficult to  stay in, like, customer service jobs where they're so demanding, and I'm not really a  people-oriented person.  Yeah, listen to me.  Listen, I'm listening to what you're saying, Susan.  You're being selfish, and I know that you may have issues, but you want everything.  You want a better-paying job, but you don't have the education.  You want a boyfriend who gives you more time, but you guys have bills. 
[03:33:30]  You want, you want, you want.  And it's like, why don't you just, instead of wanting and wanting and wanting, why don't  you do, do, do?  And by doing, even if, you're right, minimum wage jobs suck.  They don't pay great.  But you know what?  It beats sitting on your ass doing nothing but worrying about your boyfriend not giving  you enough attention.  Like, it's character-building, first of all, to work.  And in this shitty economy, if you can get a job and put something into what you guys 
[03:34:00]  are building or trying to build, then that will help alleviate some of your problems.  I still think there's more going on than you're saying.  Maybe not, not that you're lying, but I think that there's something going on that you're  not indicating.  I don't think you like him as much as you're saying, because if you did, you wouldn't be  like, should I just stay with this guy for financial support when you're not even working?  Like, instead of saying, wow, what a great guy.  He puts up with me fucking lounging around doing nothing.  Oh, no, I think, I think he is a great guy for the fact that he puts up with all my bullshit. 
[03:34:30]  Because, like, you know, I, I'm not saying that I'm completely devoid of bullshit because  I absolutely am.  I'd say in this situation, you've given me 80% bullshit.  So I'm going to let you go, but I appreciate the call.  My suggestion would be to get a job, contribute something, and stop whining about what you're  not getting.  And then if you're doing all that stuff and you still feel like, hey, I'm not getting  enough, then to me you have a legitimate gripe.  But until that, you don't.  Um, let's see. 
[03:35:00]  Okay, now someone's saying that tilapia is fine.  Now, now, Jim from Jersey.  I'm a Jim from Jersey, Eric.  So let's take Jim from Jersey.  Yes, that's me.  Hey, buddy.  How you doing, man?  Good, good.  First of all, before I get started, I want to congratulate you on telling that lazy bitch  to get off her ass.  Get off and stop fucking complaining.  Thank you.  That's exactly how I should have said it, too.  Yeah, fucking bitch.  Anyway, listen, I'm trying to lose probably about five pounds. 
[03:35:30]  I'm five foot nine.  I weigh 189 pounds.  For me to drop down to what it says I'm supposed to be, I'd be a skinny thing.  I work out all the time.  So I'm on this no-carb diet.  It's fucking impossible to find stuff that has absolutely no carbs.  Everything has a carb here or there.  Like, what are you doing?  Are you completely doing no carbs?  No, no way.  I absolutely hate, I hate no-carb diets.  They're great for immediate weight.  And again, I'm certainly not a health, but I train with two different women just because  it's really hard to get, they're both very, very busy. 
[03:36:00]  So one of them I was talking to, and I said to her about the carbs, and she's like, yeah,  eat brown rice.  She's like, you gotta have some carbs.  Most really healthy people say that some carbs, if you try to eat them earlier in the day,  are fine, and your body needs them.  If you're eating a healthy, and this sounds so corny, a healthy, balanced diet, and you're  exercising, and you're not bullshitting, you will lose the weight, or you'll be at the  weight you're supposed to be at.  I personally don't think no-carb diets are good.  I think that you need some carbs, but a lot of times we eat the wrong kinds, or we eat 
[03:36:30]  them at the wrong times, or we mix and match the wrong shit with them, so I think that's  the problem.  Yeah, that's what I was going to say, because there is good carbs.  Yeah.  There's good carbs in the day, because you just got to stay away from the white flour.  Right.  It's the same, you're supposed to stay away from bread, because also the weight scale,  like I'm five foot nine, it says I should be 176 pounds.  If I was 176 pounds, that'd be a fucking skinny little nothing.  I work out three, four times a week, you know, and now I'm just trying to lose just enough 
[03:37:00]  to show the definition in my stomach, and I work with my son, and he breaks my balls  every time I go to get some, he tells me there's carbs in there.  It's impossible.  Even steamed vegetables have carbs.  Yeah, exactly, and steamed vegetables, there's other things in life besides carbs, like there's  cancer-fighting things in vegetables and fruits, and to me, like, I would rather do a little  bit of extra work, or cut something else out of the diet, and eat something that fights  cancer, or fights the growth of tumors, so I would suggest fucking eat fruits and vegetables.  I hate when people say that fruits and vegetables are bad. 
[03:37:30]  Any diet that tells you not to eat fruits and vegetables is a fucking shit diet.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking Christ, don't eat vegetables?  What the fuck is wrong with these places?  Thank you for the call, buddy, and good luck.  I'm sure you'll lose it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Take care.  It's hard, though.  Rob in Jersey said he made out with a gal, but she stopped him, and then later she asked  him to come over.  How does this work?  Rob, you and your saucy story are on the air.  Hey, so, basically, I met this girl at a dog park, and then we've been hanging out. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, that's no way to talk about her, sir.  Yeah, I know, I know.  Anyways, we start making out after going out one night, and she stops me and says, why would  you be doing this?  Where did you think that it was going this, like, going this direction?  How old is she?  She's 21.  Okay.  And I basically said, you know, it just felt like the natural progression of things, but  if you want to stop, you know, it's not like I'm emotionally invested at this point. 
[03:38:30]  Right.  And she's like, yeah, we're just supposed to be friends, blah, blah, blah.  And I go up to my place, she cabs home, and then I get a text from her saying, this might  be stupid, but you should come over.  Did you?  Yeah.  What happened?  You know, we hooked up.  Okay.  So what that's about, it looks like a lot of times women don't want to feel like whores.  You know, it's the oldest thing in the book, but women are taught that you're supposed to 
[03:39:00]  say no, even when you want to say yes.  And that's why men sometimes misinterpret their no's as yeses, because we're like, well, women  have been taught that, but no, she actually means no.  It's hard to figure out sometimes.  So because you played it cool and weren't a douchebag about it, you probably didn't make her feel  pressured and obligated, and therefore not like a whore.  Like, she had some control.  You left.  Right.  So then she's like, well, fuck, I did want to fool around with this guy.  So you played it right.  A lot of times if a girl thinks, hey, it's fine if we don't fuck, she'll fuck. 
[03:39:30]  Not always, but a lot of times the problem women have is the obligation men feel.  Like, okay, I'm in your apartment, you owe me pussy.  And I never play it like that.  When I'm with girls, I mean, again, I will occasionally have, you know, the ones in my  life that didn't want to do anything.  But I get a lot farther than a lot of people.  And I think it's because they really know that they're under no pressure to do anything.  Like, you know, I'm not going to go fucking ballistic and try to force feed you dick if you  don't want to suck my dick.  So you played it right. 
[03:40:00]  And you were like, good, fine, I'll just go home.  And then that made her go, well, hey, I kind of wanted to fuck this guy.  So good for you, my friend.  All right.  Thanks very much, man.  All right.  Next time, take what's yours.  Oh, let's see here.  How about Mark in Colorado, who's having, who's religious his whole life?  Mark?  Yeah, man.  When I was raised, believed, hook, line, and sinker, you couldn't have, you know, faltered  my beliefs. 
[03:40:30]  And then as an adult, I got rocked pretty hard and have just added up and I just don't believe  anymore.  Yeah.  However, my problem is, is because whatever happened happened to me and my belief is my  belief.  But my children have been raised, who are now teenagers, have been raised in the same belief  system that I was in and it's, I'm stuck.  Do I tell them, hey, your dad doesn't believe anymore, so don't believe either because they're  going to, you know, they're going to follow.  I think, pardon my interruption, but I think you got half of it right there. 
[03:41:00]  You just said, do I tell them dad doesn't believe anymore, so you shouldn't believe.  I think you just answered your own question, but you won't, half of that's right.  I think if you, I think you should be honest and say that dad doesn't believe anymore.  And then instead of saying, you shouldn't believe, you put a period after that.  You, I think if you speak for yourself and let them have their own belief system because  they're teenagers, you know, that's what I would personally think would work, even though  I've never raised the kids.  So I don't understand those dynamics like you do, but. 
[03:41:30]  Well, I know that, uh, the problem is, is that they're taught.  I mean, I remember when I was a teenager, if I didn't have to go to church, I wouldn't.  Yeah.  So that's the problem.  And it's like, uh, if that's not taught to them, that all, every religion is taught.  And, you know, if you're like, I can't believe in Muslim because I'm not, you know, I'm so  void from that belief because it's not taught to me.  If it was taught to me, I might believe that.  You said you got rocked.  What did, what rocked you?  Was it an incident or you mean you just changed because you looked at science stuff more?  What rocked you? 
[03:42:00]  Um, I was, I was a complete, I was very hard believed Christian.  Um, then I went away from it, didn't believe, and it was completely selfish, piece of crap  who treated everybody horribly.  And then, um, uh, uh, in my marriage, everything, and then came back in and, you know, rededicated  my life and I was really living hard for it.  My children being born was probably what did it to me to make me be more of it.  And then, um, uh, lies and deceit afterwards, after I was, you know, came back and was doing 
[03:42:30]  better, you know, made me questions.  And if, if, if I was, if I was doing bad and went up, fell away from a belief and doing  bad and get rocked, Hey, this is what happens.  You don't believe this is what, this is what happens.  If there's a God up there and says, um, you shouldn't have waited until I believed again  to have my entire world turned upside down, um, because of lies and deceit.  And, and then, you know, expecting it to say, you knew it was going to happen.  If you're all, if you're omnipotent, you know that, uh, I'm going to feel this way 
[03:43:00]  afterwards.  Why are you going to wait until I believe again?  You know, I understand if I'm doing bad, you can treat it bad karma, but when I'm doing  good and that you're going to open my eyes into the horrors of the world.  No.  And that just tells me things are adding everything.  So you just say, you, you, you, evidence, see, I like people who change their opinion.  And I, I, I even respect people who didn't believe in God and then come to believe in  God.  Like, you know, to me, we, we are too wrapped up as people in pride in our belief systems. 
[03:43:30]  You know, I'm proud of my beliefs and I thank you very much for the call, Mark.  I appreciate that.  And I, I, my, my suggestion, by the way, like I said, would be to tell, always be honest  with them, but I don't think you can force them to believe the way you do.  You found your way and they'll find their way, which may be sticking with the religion  or, or coming the way you do, whatever their path is, is their path.  But people who are proud of their belief system, I'm a proud liberal.  I'm a goddamn proud Republican.  Well, then you're a fucking moron. 
[03:44:00]  You're a moron.  Because to me, to be that wrapped up in a belief system or an ideology means you ignore  any evidence to the contrary.  And I think that people who do that are not open.  And, you know, the, you know what, we as human beings are contradictions sometimes.  Like, I felt very strongly about the war in Iraq at one point.  I believed in it.  I thought it was right.  And then, you know what, I was wrong.  I didn't believe in it after a while.  And instead of being a twat and defending why I thought what I thought because I don't 
[03:44:30]  want to look bad or because I want to defend my belief system, I believe I was wrong.  I believe I looked at it a way I look at differently now.  But we punish each other for that shit.  We punish each other when politicians, and again, there are wishy-washy guys that change  their opinion for a few votes.  And those guys are cunts.  But, you know, if you have a change of heart about something, we punish you and say you're  wishy-washy so we don't allow politicians to have change of hearts.  We don't allow each other to have change. 
[03:45:00]  But you said, you know, and I don't know.  I don't believe in pride in a belief system.  I think that we put too much stock in being married to ideologies, and I think that that's  where we get stuck.  Because then the whole thing is you're spent trying to shoehorn everything into your ideology.  You're trying to defend your ideology instead of being open to new information.  Okay, let's see.  No, you don't need to do that.  In the low-carb.  Okay, hey, John in Rochester. 
[03:45:30]  Used to weigh 400 pounds, and now he's 280.  Did the low-carb diet.  All right, hi, John.  Hey, Jim, how are you doing?  Good, thank you, buddy, for the call.  Well, I got a statement and a question.  Yeah, about two years ago, I was 410 pounds, and I don't want to say low-carb, but I cut  out, in the last two years, I haven't had a cake, a candy, a chip.  I cut out all that garbage in the last two years.  And if you do, like you said, a good-carb diet, and I eat the vegetables and the fruit, 
[03:46:00]  and it comes off, man.  It's just cutting out that garbage.  But the second part, the question I have for it, I've hit like a plateau in the last,  I don't know, I've been stuck for probably about three months now.  Any suggestions on how to jumpstart that?  Do you go to the gym?  Yeah, I do go to the gym.  I mean, I'm a truck driver.  I do go to the gym.  I don't go as much as I'd like to because of my job, but I do go to the gym.  I mean, I know I've dropped 124 pounds, so a plateau is inevitable, but I'd like to get 
[03:46:30]  it jumpstarted again.  Yeah, yeah, your body plateaus, I think.  And that's, by the way, why I got trainers.  And I got two, again, just because they're so busy.  I want to do two sessions a week with a trainer plus my own.  But you get caught up in your own routine, whatever that is, however often you go to the  gym, whatever it is you eat, and sometimes they say you got to shock your body.  You can't let your muscles get too used to stuff.  Your body just adjusts to, like people in prison, it just becomes your existence.  It becomes your life. 
[03:47:00]  Well, that's what your body says.  Okay, this is where I am.  This is what's going on.  So I think to jumpstart it, I would suggest maybe talk to a nutritionist once and go through  the diet carefully of what you're eating and say, what can I eat?  What can I cut out here that is putting weight on me that I don't realize is putting or keeping  weight on me?  What combination might help?  And what exercise?  Because how tall are you?  Six foot.  Yeah, six foot.  Now, you might have some extra skin that needs to be taken off eventually, so maybe that puts  a little weight.  But you could probably lose a good amount more weight on your own. 
[03:47:30]  And I'm going to guess exercise is a huge part of it.  And you probably need to go in and shock your body a little bit.  And by shock it, I mean just do stuff you're not used to doing.  And you could maybe go online and find some really good exercises if you can't afford a  trainer, because I've got some great ab workouts and shit from being online.  But that would be my suggestion from my minimal amount of knowledge in your life, is just  to kind of shake it up a little.  Shake it up.  Shake it up a little bit, because your body is just used to what's happening, okay?  Okay, Jimmy.  I appreciate it, man. 
[03:48:00]  And I got a lot of the motivation from listening to you guys, you know, when I was big and  heavy.  I always had the excuses.  You guys said it was not an excuse when I listened to you guys in the morning.  So I just want to thank you guys, because believe it or not, all the fun you guys make  fun of people, and talking about the airplane, you know, sitting in the airplane and everything  out, it does make you sit back and think when you're a big guy, you know, these guys are  right.  It's about time to do something.  So I just want to thank you, man.  Thank you, man.  Congratulations.  That's great that you lost all that weight.  And keep going.  I mean, that's really good news.  And hi, Spencer, in Florida. 
[03:48:30]  You said, we somehow can't separate religion and recovery.  Do you mean the collective we, or you and I, Spencer?  I didn't catch that last part, but yeah, just kind of in general, because I've heard  you, I've been listening to you, and I love you, by the way.  Thank you.  Are you in recovery?  I actually, yeah, I'm a recovered addict.  Oh, cool.  I'm a holicun addict.  Okay, cool.  And I help a lot of guys.  I get the opportunity to sponsor a lot of guys, and obviously, this God thing is the one  thing that really popped up the most, and I didn't believe in God. 
[03:49:00]  You know, and it's really, just here in the last, I think the guy before was talking about  now, he doesn't believe because something happened.  You know, and even that is kind of a self-centered way to do it, and I think that's why we have  such a problem in believing in something bigger than nothing.  When you say the word God, just the word, the three little words, G-O-D, it just brings  this flood of, you know, Catholicism and Baptist church and whatever, and it's just not that. 
[03:49:30]  I don't, I stay as far away from churches as I can.  I don't, I don't want anything to do with them, but I do believe there's something out  there bigger than nothing.  Even when I hear those discussions with Penn Jillette, and he talks about things, really  all he's doing is discounting religion, not necessarily a spiritual way of life.  Well, let me just jump in with you for a second, Spencer, because I agree with you.  Like, the problem is, and I think, and Stan Hope and I talked about this too, and the  word God throws a lot of people in there getting sober and in recovery because God is mentioned 
[03:50:00]  in 12 Steps and blah, blah, blah.  Part of that is when it was written again as we talked about it.  And one thing I've forgotten, because I said God could be a group of drunks, but somebody  said, for years I've known, God can be good, orderly direction.  It doesn't have to be a deity.  It doesn't have to be, some people, I think Penn believes in a non-spiritual, like a spiritual  way of life could be helping other people and giving of yourself.  It doesn't have to be a deity-oriented thing. 
[03:50:30]  There is a way to recover completely and be sober and have a great life and be a perfect  member of society without having any belief whatsoever in a deity.  And here's, and even the good orderly direction, and people, a lot of times you hear people  say, like, do the next right thing.  I even discount that because, and I say this all the time, and I, you know, is I don't  know what the next right thing is.  I did a lot of shitty things.  I mean, stealing, you know, just fucked over people.  I mean, I did a lot of shitty things in my life and got suicidal and all that with the 
[03:51:00]  drugs and alcohol, I went through and was a horrible, despicable person.  But to say that I shouldn't have done any of those things, I wouldn't be married today  and have kids and the job I have and be where I am today had I not done all those shitty,  horrible things.  Yeah, but for me to tell someone to do, I don't know if you need to go out there and  date that girl with two months of recovery and be taken for everything you got to realize 
[03:51:30]  maybe I shouldn't do that.  But we do know, you know what, we do know in a way, and again, there's always gray area,  but let's be honest, without the semantics, we know the difference between right and wrong.  Like you're saying, I shouldn't have done those things or I wouldn't have been married.  That's happened to be the way it worked out, but I shouldn't have done bad things just  because I shouldn't have done bad things.  Like, I understand that sometimes good things come out of it or, hey, look, if I hadn't been  robbing that house, I wouldn't have run into 7-Eleven and met that girl.  Like, okay, life does work out that way sometimes, but we can't live life, or I don't think we 
[03:52:00]  can live life thinking, hey, I can't tell people to do the right thing because by doing  the wrong thing, they may lock up and have a life-changing, wonderful experience.  I think most times experience tells us that if you do what the next right thing is, and  look, dude, we don't always know what it is, but most times we have a good idea.  Like, I agree with you, but that's the argument with this, you know, also the choice in using  it or not. 
[03:52:30]  You know, when the girl goes in the crack house and gets gang raped, she does not want  to go back in that crack house again, but why is she there a week later?  That's a lack of choice.  She doesn't have that choice in there.  And the thing is, yes, we do know the right thing, and I don't mean to get into the semantics  of it, but it's really just opinion.  It's opinion and common sense.  And I think that, you know, to bring it back to the religious thing, I think we're, as a  society, in need of moving away from organized religion and realizing that there is something 
[03:53:00]  greater out there.  And even people who use science and all that as a discount for God, you can't wrap your  mind around the fact that this world is however many billion years old.  Spencer, Spencer, I don't mean to cut you off.  We have to.  Eric gave me a two-minute sign.  I have another live read to do, and I actually have to end the show.  So I'm not cutting you off because you're talking.  It's literally, the computer will shut me off.  So thank you for the call.  It was an interesting phone call, but we have to go because we just, we have to end the  show.  All right.  So, buddy, thank you for the call. 
[03:53:30]  And I think what Spencer is saying in a very nutshell is we all have our own way of looking  at stuff.  Some are organized religion.  Some believe in nothing, like Penn and Spencer thinks that there's something.  I just think if people are a little more respectful about each other's fucking vibes, and again,  that comes with not being so married to any one way of thinking, we'd all be a little  bit better off.  Thank you all for the calls.  The phone lines were lit, so I apologize for not getting to everybody.  Going to see Jimmy, how do I avoid looking like a douche?  Bring a girl who will blow me.  Protein supplement I've used. 
[03:54:00]  It works great.  Yes, so do I have that.  Daryl, it's called Come.  If he's a truck driver, some truck stops have fitness centers.  Okay, Rick, some of them don't.  I'm 60 days sober.  I'm starting to lose my belief in God.  Well, you know, give it some time, Ray, in North Carolina.  Just keep coming back.  You know, as they say, bring the body and the mind will follow.  Don't worry about your God belief right now.  Just keep showing up.  You're doing well. </pre>
