<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Columbus Day, focusing on the brutal realities of Columbus's arrival in the Americas, including violence, enslavement, and rape.  This transitioned into a conversation about the New England Patriots and New York Jets,  commenting on the Jets' surprising success despite Brett Favre's performance and the Patriots' loss.  The hosts discussed Matt Cassel's unusual path to becoming the Patriots' quarterback, further elaborated on by a Boston caller.

Frank Caliendo then joined the show. He described his experiences performing stand-up at "virus shows," using military metaphors to illustrate audience reactions, recounting both positive and negative experiences. He shared an anecdote about a positive interaction with Karl Rove, who revealed President Bush was a fan.  Caliendo discussed the challenges of impressions, particularly of John Madden and Sarah Palin, leading into a discussion about the upcoming election and the aging of presidents.  The sports theme returned briefly with a mention of Sarah Palin at a Flyers game and Jim Jefferies' show. The segment concluded with the "Guess the Sound" game and a mention of a new video by "Creepy gay kid."

Anthony then detailed his Saturday night exploits, which included extensive time at a strip club ("The Carousel"), resulting in a hangover and a text message from a Slovakian stripper. He described his driving habits after drinking and recounted attending a Fall Festival and encountering people who'd witnessed his previous night's spending at FH Riley's.  This led into "Jocktober," a segment satirizing pre-packaged radio content, featuring pre-written jokes, song parodies (including one about Barack Obama), and a fabricated Alan Alda interview.  The recurring joke "there's a person stranded" was used throughout.  The Cuban Missile Crisis was discussed, sparked by a History Channel program. The segment also touched upon Ohio's swing state status and ended with a graphic "Guess the Sound" segment.

The next segment began with a discussion of a humorous website featuring a woman enduring food and spit being thrown on her face. This transitioned to announcing a contest winner, Ian from Connecticut, who won earbuds and a Family Guy event.  The "F.U. Line" followed, a series of vulgar voicemails filled with angry messages directed at various individuals and entities.  Jim Norton then joined the show, discussing his upcoming appearances and anxieties about his career.  The conversation shifted to negative movie-going experiences and audience behavior.  An anecdote about Jim Norton and an old lady in a theater was shared. A caller, Todd, suggested staying home if they disliked the movies.  The discussion moved to a church-sponsored anti-pornography event, "Porn and Pastries," its ironic attendance, and contrasting views on sex and relationships.  Callers shared their experiences with religious institutions and perspectives on pornography, and the segment ended with a listener's account of a negative sexual encounter.  Daniel Marr, author of “Bro-cabulary,” was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

Daniel Maurer, author of *Brocabulary*, was interviewed.  The interview focused on the book's neologisms for men, many related to drinking, sex, and interactions with women. Numerous terms were discussed, including "bromo," "gallaby," "tugly," "slam decapped," "transvest tanked," "master date," "holaroid," and "mornography."  The "Ten Bro-manments" were also covered. The conversation frequently involved descriptions of sexual acts and bodily functions.  Listener calls, including a highly disruptive and profane one, were interspersed.  The creation process of the book was discussed, along with listener-submitted reinterpretations of the Opie and Anthony song "Pendulum."  Steve revealed a self-inflicted drastic haircut.

The final segment involved the hosts and a studio audience, focusing on a profane reimagining of "Pendulum," with numerous lyric alterations referencing sex and bodily fluids.  A pizza-eating contest and Pat from Hunaki were mentioned.  A listener's request for a "Pendulum" cover by Sleeves was considered.  The segment included numerous instances of profane language and sexually explicit jokes.  A Webex advertisement was incorporated into their "brocabulary." Line of the day segments featured more offensive jokes, including a racist one.  The show ended running over schedule with numerous profane remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Why are we here?  Isn't this like a day you're supposed to take off?  This is one of those iffy days.  Why?  It's Columbus Day.  Yeah, but I'm related to Pilgrims.  Pilgrims?  Is it a Pilgrims holiday?  Which one is this?  No, this is when...  Oh, Christopher, right?  Yeah, but he...  Columbus comes over and started the massacre of the entire... 
[00:00:30]  indigenous people, which led to the greatness that we have today.  We were the first terrorists.  Don't you know that?  People never understand that.  It's like, that's when the world was just...  You take ships over places, and you just beat the crap out of whoever lived there,  and you take their...  You just take their land.  You have sex with their women?  Yeah, you dilute their population, you enslave them, you do whatever you want.  Those were the days.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it was all about. 
[00:01:00]  And then they talk about it, like, on today's standards, and ethics, and things like that,  where it's like, that was horrible, that was...  Shut up.  It was the only way the world kind of worked back then.  I always say, it's like the beginning of the Monopoly game, where you just land on something,  you go, buy, buy, buy.  And then after you get all your crap, then you gotta duke it out with each other by,  you know, putting hotels and things like that.  But at the beginning, it's just, you know, buy, buy, buy.  Every man for themselves.  Then it was like, get on ships, go over there, kick ass, take their crap. 
[00:01:30]  Vikings rule.  Vikings, same thing.  Vikings rule.  They go over there and just, you know, kind of take people's crap.  That's it.  So that's, you know, Columbus.  Here's just part of the machine.  Well, can we figure this out?  Because some people get the holiday off and some don't.  What's that about?  I know.  I heard today it's like it's a federal holiday, but the market's open and banks have the option.  Like if the bank manager, I guess, wakes up and goes, I don't feel like going in. 
[00:02:00]  Would we have gotten in trouble if we took today off?  Hells no.  All right, then let's get out of here.  All right.  That was the Opie and Anthony show.  See you tomorrow.  Oh, God, we should have recorded that Friday and just played it.  Oh, that would rock.  And not have been here.  How do the people know we didn't?  That would rock.  Maybe we're not here.  Maybe we're not.  Maybe this is a secret like show that we like recorded Friday.  So we could take off on Columbus Day.  Yeah, exactly.  Ah.  Dumb Columbus Day. 
[00:02:30]  I was out there in Huntington enjoying myself and had to drive all the way back to the city.  I'm thinking, why don't we just make a pact and not come in today?  Believe that Jets loss yesterday?  God, that was terrible.  Well, a lot of...  I hope I got that right.  And the Pats just kicking ass.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I feel bad for the Pats fans.  You got a quarterback that played...  How did...  What was the final score of the Pats game last night?  They got their ass handed to them.  Oh, yeah.  By the charges.  What? 
[00:03:00]  It was 30 to 10.  30 to 10.  And their quarterback, you know, because now everyone's paying attention to Matt Castle,  you know, who's taking home for Brady.  Do you know that this guy was drafted into the NFL and barely played in college?  How does that happen?  He barely played in high school, barely played in college, and he's in the NFL.  Replacing, like, the best quarterback ever.  Right, right, right.  That's, you know, at least if he was replacing, you know, a crappy quarterback, it would have  been one thing. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, because someone in Boston calls and explains the story of Matt Castle, because it's kind  of bizarre.  Because the announcers, I was watching the game last night a little bit before I crashed,  and they're all confused, like, so someone explain how this guy's an NFL quarterback if  he barely played in college.  How does a team draft him?  Yeah.  I don't know.  He hasn't played, like, on a regular basis in eight, nine years, something like that.  No, in Massachusetts, there's probably something to do with nepotism.  Like, he's the son of a toll taker or something. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Those guys stink.  I feel bad for them now.  It was 30 to 10.  Chargers, are they doing all right this year?  No, they had a couple of last-second losses early, so they're starting to generate some  wins now.  I think Patrice O'Neal brought this to our attention last week.  There's a lot of teams out there that they're just there, so all the other teams, the real  teams, have teams to play.  Until, like, the playoffs.  And I kind of put the Chargers in that category, you know? 
[00:04:30]  No, it's funny you said the Jets lost, because basically, the sports pages here in New York  are basically saying, yeah, they lost.  I'm saying they lost, but they won the game.  Even though, technically, they won, but they said Brett Favre, like, stunk up the joint,  and, you know, the Jets, who are 3-2, you know, have a much better record than they  should have, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, so.  Is that a stupid cowboy game?  No.  Oh, boy.  No. 
[00:05:00]  No.  No, I missed that one.  Pee-hee.  Oh, stink-a-rooney.  No, just the way it ended.  What did they play?  I don't even know.  In Arizona.  Oh, right, right.  It ended overtime.  Yeah.  And I think Dallas went 3-0 out, and then a kick got blocked.  Ooh.  Block that kick.  Block that kick.  The crowd must have been saying that.  I don't know what the crowd was saying, but then they must have been saying, fall on it  in the end zone.  Falling on the end zone.  Oh, really?  That's what he did, and that was a quick one. 
[00:05:30]  Well, the whole night, still have to go out and have fun.  No need to watch this game.  It's over.  Arizona 30, the Cowboys 24.  Do they have one of those wimpy, like, soccer kickers?  I don't know.  Or do they have a real guy?  No, they just got through the line.  I mean, they just...  Yeah.  It's like, basically, after the snap was snapped, there was two Cardinals standing  there with their arms folded, waiting for them to kick it.  They just kind of blocked it.  Oh, there we go.  We're going to get an explanation on this, Matt Cassidy.  Oh, goody.  Well, he's replacing Brady, who's easily in the top ten quarterbacks in football. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Literal Jim.  There you go.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Give me the story of Matt Cassidy.  Matt Cassidy played a couple years in NFL Europe, and I believe he was winning quarterback  a few years ago for the Amsterdam Admirals in the World Bowl.  Shut up.  The Amsterdam Admirals in the World Bowl.  Can I tell you something?  That's it.  I don't listen to sports radio.  I'll take a listen here and there.  Yeah.  But I feel like I know a little bit about sports every... 
[00:06:30]  I don't even know if this guy's for real.  Yeah.  Is that a team?  Is there a World Bowl?  You know what it is to me?  Football around the rest of the world is pretty much like soccer is here.  Uh-huh.  No one really pays attention to it.  Yeah, they're trying to make it happen in Europe, like they're trying to make soccer  happen here in the States.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't we just leave it alone?  You guys rule with soccer.  We rule with football.  Let's not intermingle.  Let's just be bored with each other's sports.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, we got Dave in Boston.  Dave, how are you?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Morning.  Good morning.  So, Matt Cassidy is the world's greatest professional clipboard holder.  He does great on the sidelines, but damn, last night, if he didn't look like Drew Bledsoe,  it just killed me.  Yeah.  You guys are going to have a rough.  But you still got your socks in it, so.  Yeah.  But now, see, now they expect the socks to win. 
[00:07:30]  They're all like, it's like, who was saying that, that they're winners now?  Was that Bill Burr or?  Somebody.  Yeah.  They're saying, like, now, you know, you won and you make the playoffs and everything,  so now they just expect the socks to win.  Yeah.  It's the Patriots.  Otherwise, the entire east coast of Massachusetts is going to, you know, like, burn to the ground  soon because we're watching the ultimate collapse after, you know, the rise to power and the 
[00:08:00]  rise to greatness.  Just, yeah, right back where you belong, I guess.  Oh, it's like 85, 86 all over again.  And you got the Red Sox as a distraction, but they're playing the Devil Rays.  How did this minor league team get into the playoffs this year?  Because the $8 billion payroll sissy Yankees couldn't do it?  Yeah, no kidding.  That's like playing Tidewater, I think.  If you don't beat the Devil Rays, there's something wrong with you guys.  All right, Dave, thank you.  Let's go to Bill in New Hampshire. 
[00:08:30]  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  What's up, boys?  Listen, Matt Castle went to USC and was backing up Carson Palmer.  Then Carson Palmer graduated, went to...  Golf's got nothing to do with it.  Oh, Carson.  And then Matt Leinhart and Castle were competing for the same job, and I guess it was neck and  neck, and they went with Leinhart.  So I guess he is a good quarterback.  He's just, he never got any respect, so he's going to have the little stuff. 
[00:09:00]  But no one's really explaining why, if the guy wasn't playing a lot in college, why he  would be drafted in the NFL.  Because I guess he's just as good, but he, you know, he...  But how do you know?  He'd improve it.  There's guys out there that kicked ass for their college team, and they fell short of getting  into the NFL.  So, they just saw potential in a guy that really didn't play in college?  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  He got drafted by the Oakland A's and could have went to baseball, and he didn't. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, good.  One of those.  Oh, one of those two-sport guys.  Wonderful.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  See you.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Frank Caliendo.  How are you, Frank?  Hi, Frank.  I haven't seen you since you were counseling me.  Huh?  I haven't seen you since you were counseling me.  Counseling?  What do you mean?  When I, uh, when we were at the, uh, at the, uh...  The virus show?  The virus shows.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I go, Frank, it's okay.  I was, I was...  I would get off stage. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And, uh...  By the way, there was, like, a huge mix-up.  Like, somebody...  I don't know if you heard, but somebody said that I didn't want to do the show.  I didn't...  Oh, you didn't hear?  Okay.  I didn't hear any of that.  Okay, cool.  Because, like, uh, like, TBS, um, heard from my manager, Barry, that I didn't want to do  the show.  I'm like, why would I not want to do the show?  I never heard that.  So I've come in here worried that you guys had heard that I wasn't going to come, like,  didn't...  Like, somebody told me I didn't want to come in.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  I never... 
[00:10:30]  I didn't say that.  I...  Look at all rumors.  Yeah.  You know what I love...  That's my whole life now.  You know what I love about the, uh, the virus shows that went on?  Comics come in, and it's exactly like you're talking about being in the NOM.  Yeah.  It's like...  Oh, yeah.  God damn that virus.  Ooh, I remember that.  Yeah, but people...  It was like the battle away.  Uh, it was...  Oh, boy.  Because some of the guys are like the guys that ran out and put down some suppressing fire  and everything was cool, and then other guys are like the guys that got hit. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It's like...  And I got hit.  He got hit.  And had to be evac'd out, and...  Right.  That's just...  That's why we have a helicopter backstage.  Yeah.  It's like, you evac'd there.  To take you right to the hospital.  Dust off!  Dust off!  We lost Bob Kelly in Cleveland.  Yeah.  Well, Bob Kelly would tell, like, tell Barry Katz, my manager, he'd tell him that it was...  Frank goes out there, and he does his own thing.  He sticks to his guns.  He doesn't get dirty, and he does great.  And my manager, like, I heard you're doing incredible.  I'll be, no, I'm tanking. 
[00:11:30]  I'm getting destroyed.  There are people that are booing before I even get on there.  I don't even know what's happening.  Savages.  See, this is why we really don't think we can do that anymore, because you can't boo the  comedian before you even start.  And it's become something that people enjoy doing.  It's like, all right, here comes one.  We're going to let him have it.  And the listeners, they're having fun doing all this, but they don't understand the other  side, because something like Frank or other guys, they all talk.  Yeah.  So then it prevents us from getting other people on the tour. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, but the most...  Yeah, I'm thinking of doing the virus talk.  Oh, you don't want to do the virus talk.  No, see, I wouldn't say that.  I would say just be prepared for it.  Because Voss would go up there and obliterate.  Yeah.  I mean, Voss would...  And when you see Voss obliterate, you're thinking, okay, I can do all that.  Voss just obliterated.  Right.  But he would...  I mean, he would be on...  Kill.  And then you go up there and you're like...  Pins dropping. 
[00:12:30]  Like, I've known the show fairly well, but the people that are there always, they know  the show intricately.  Yeah.  So you're making in-show references and stuff, and that's the stuff that's killing.  You're trying to do bits, and people are like, it's a bit!  It's a bit!  Kill him!  Why is he doing a bit?  He's rehearsed this!  Voss is the same type of retard that they are, is what it is.  They totally...  I was so jealous.  I would just sit there, I'd be like, Rich, you killed him.  Like, you think I did pretty good? 
[00:13:00]  Okay.  And he would act like he didn't do so great.  Look at the girl you're with.  People, yeah, she's a pig!  Oh, he was great.  Frank brings up a good point.  And Voss walks around like, you know, he knew it.  Oh, he struts around.  That's right.  Oh, you think you did?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he would have...  And then when they would come...  Let me tell you, people.  I would go out, and I would be so down.  I would be, you know, because I'm used to doing well.  I'm used to...  And it's good to get...  It's used to get...  It's okay to get beaten up.  I think it taught me something, you know, that you're never that good. 
[00:13:30]  Like, you can...  Like, and I don't mean that as a total negative.  I mean...  But then I would go, and I just wanted to see...  I just wanted to see Norton go on stage.  Because as soon as...  Like, Norton would go out, what, in the second half?  Yeah.  The people...  And when you guys went out there, too, it was the same thing.  Even, you know, but to watch the three of you guys go out there, the cheers.  For doing nothing.  For just standing there.  Well, at least I had some respect for Norton, because I knew he was going to do some jokes. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Exactly.  You guys just stood.  Hands went up.  It's like, hey.  What's up?  Harding to see.  How you doing?  No, I was all...  I mean, it was so real.  I would just go...  I'd be so down, and people are like, what's wrong, Frank?  I'd go, I just, you know, don't know if I'm going to do comedy anymore.  But Norton's going on.  Let me go see.  And I would, like, go to the side of the stage and just go from...  It just had this...  Yeah.  It was just awesome.  You walk off stage, you hear a lot of, oh, don't worry about it. 
[00:14:30]  It's okay.  Yeah, yeah.  It was all right.  Don't worry about it.  And then there's the people that walk off, and everybody, after they come backstage,  turns away and looks at the floor.  Like, oh.  It was like, oh, yeah.  Oh, I had that feeling a couple times.  Oh, yeah.  You know you're taking it when there's no eye contact.  There's people like...  The comedian walks off, he's just looking for someone to talk to, and everyone's going  opposite directions.  Yeah.  And we all get together.  We all get together and go, all right, I'll talk to him.  I'll be the one.  Who's going to be the one, man?  I think he's going to kill himself. 
[00:15:00]  Normally, you want to tease somebody who bombs, but in these situations, you know what it  is.  It's not like the guy didn't go out there and it wasn't funny.  It was like...  It's one of those frustrating things.  You're watching a guy who you know is funny.  It's like, what can you say about that?  It's kind of, but it's in a way, inside, it's a little bit of fun to watch your friends  just go, that you know are really good, tank it once in a while.  When you hear that first, boo!  And then me and Opie look at each other panicked like, oh, no, he's going to get it.  Right.  Oh, no, this is the sacrificial lamb. 
[00:15:30]  How about the comedians that see the audience doesn't get to see this when they come backstage  and they're practically crying like, I made it!  I actually made it!  I made it out!  Oh, my God!  Yeah, that was me in Vegas when I got through it.  The first one actually went pretty decently.  Frank and Frank did one.  This would be all right.  I think we did our first one.  Yeah.  I think we started this whole thing in Vegas.  But it was once it got outside, I got scared.  Once it got outside, there's no control over human beings in the, you know, outside. 
[00:16:00]  So you don't know where the boos are coming from.  You don't know where the trouble's starting.  In my first set, the first set, I was told, I don't think, I still don't know the truth.  I thought that I was getting booed and they said, no, somebody was getting kicked out of  the stadium.  I go, no, I think I was at least getting partially booed because I brought up Bush and to go to  the Bush impression and I heard a boo.  And I actually wrote a bit about that now to come back because, you know, he has to hear  that sometimes, you know, Bush has to, whenever he goes somewhere. 
[00:16:30]  He's got to change it in his mind to think it's okay going, I bet they're saying Bush.  That's what they're doing.  They're saying Bush.  Go Bushy.  Go Bushy.  You know, it's that thing.  Because when I bring up the president now, people go, they just, they will boo.  That's their automatic response.  Supposedly, Stuntbrae was telling us that even Carter said this weekend that at least  he did a better job than Bush.  Wow.  Carter probably loves that Bush got in there and just did what he did.  It's gotten to the point where Carter can now say, well, I guess I'm not officially 
[00:17:00]  the worst president ever.  Well, you can find positives everywhere.  I'm the guy that made Jimmy Carter look good.  Yeah.  There you go, France.  Yeah.  It's 98 days to go.  And boy, are we counting down now.  Oof.  Yeah.  He looks haggard.  He looks beyond haggard.  He's got that.  But it's the same look that Clinton had.  Like, just get me out of here.  Yeah, get me out of here.  I've had it.  Was Clinton like that at the end?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Because remember, they were talking about impeaching him and all that kind of stuff.  Yeah, it was just a pile on at the end. 
[00:17:30]  They just wanted him.  And by the day, the hair got grayer and grayer.  And Bush, too.  Bush's hair is just now shock white.  Just take it.  It's like he came down from Mount Ararat or something.  It's just big, long locks of gray, white hair.  You just look at his, look at their eye bags.  When they start as president and when they end as president.  I love the before and after shots of these guys.  Completely different people.  They age like twice.  Twice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's horrid. 
[00:18:00]  That's why, you know, McCain, Jesus Christ, is going to be the crypt keeper coming out of  office if he made it through.  He'll go full circle.  He'll be young again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  30.  Yeah.  Dark, jet black hair, right?  Bush is.  That's the scary part is he's just, yeah.  But you know what?  The thing with Bush, when you see the president of the United States on TV before recently,  even if you didn't like the guy or you didn't vote for him, you always were like, oh, the  president's speaking.  I got to listen to this.  No one's listening to him anymore.  It's like, shut up. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  You're not going to solve this economic crisis with anything you're saying.  No one believes you.  I think.  You know what I mean?  Like Reagan, I, you know, I lean Democrat, but that was a leader.  Like if he was talking about the economic crisis, you would sit there and stop everything  of this guy has it under control.  He didn't really seem to care about the polls or anything.  He would just like cut things and cut programs and people would get pissed at him and he  would just go, you know.  Yeah.  So what?  He didn't care.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  I, I, it's, it's weird.  These guys, I, I had the opportunity to meet different people lately, but I was in  Sacramento and I see, uh, I see Carl Rove over.  He's speaking of this thing.  Now, whether you think the guy, the guy's a genius, whether you put the word evil in  front of it or not, that's, you know, that's your political leaning bag.  Whether you put the word douche.  That's how we're different.  That's a, that's the difference between us.  You have a TV show and sell it everywhere. 
[00:19:30]  I am three market Jimmy.  Why are you just ignoring that?  You don't have an HBO show, my friend.  Come on.  Like a legitimate, like long running program.  All right.  Long running, the second year, the only five episodes, the first 10 new ones.  I said program, like I'm my fat aunt.  You've got to program this, Frank.  I'm watching my stories.  What do you want?  My stories.  I didn't mean to cut you off, man.  You were, Carl.  Carl.  So I'm like thinking, I don't want to, and I, you know, I'm a middle of the road kind  of guy.  I tend to, I might be slightly to the right, I think, but I'm in the middle, you know, 
[00:20:00]  to me, I'm definitely not far right, religious right.  That's just not me.  I like business.  That's, you know, I just like money.  That's what it is.  I like to keep my money, you know?  So the, so I'm thinking, I don't want to bother Karl Rove, you know?  So I decide not to, and I'm in the front seat because I can't sit in back seats of cars.  I just, I get a little car sick or something like that.  So I'm in the front seat and the driver drives us up there.  Karl Rove comes running over to me.  He's knocking on the window.  He's like, Frank, Frank, hey, hey, how are you? 
[00:20:30]  I'm like, fine, what is this, the Patriot Act?  What's happening?  And he's like, oh, hey, the president is a huge fan.  You do some great stuff.  If you're ever in D.C., the president would love to see you, I'm sure.  Oh, yeah, okay.  You're knocking the White House.  I'm here.  Yeah.  I said stop by.  Here's the thing.  I have Karl Rove's email address.  Nice.  All right, give it out.  Yeah, right.  No, that's, believe me, that's.  He says you meat spin.  Meat spin.  So he's actually cool to you when you met him.  Yeah, very cool. 
[00:21:00]  Like, he's like the president, you know, he likes what you do.  It's just like, I was like, because I've looked for that.  I've never been able to get that validation.  I've always wanted to have him see it.  You're, you know, they're setting you up, right?  Yeah.  They probably hate you, hate your impression.  You're going to go to the White House.  Next thing you know, you're going to be.  In that room.  You're going to be in the dungeon with like.  Frank Caliendo, the terrorist list.  You're going to be in the dungeon with nipple clamps on and they're going to be torturing you.  It's not always so bad.  You'll be down there with Dana Carvey.  He'll be like, no, they make an imposter of you and send. 
[00:21:30]  Wait, I can feel Hartman's still alive.  Exactly.  What?  This is where they keep them all.  Yeah.  But it was surreal.  I mean, that's pretty cool.  You know, when, when Carl Rowe comes, he comes kind of pranced over to me and I was like,  that's surreal.  These guys.  You don't get the same thing.  It was.  You don't get the same thing from John Madden, right?  Isn't it true?  He just doesn't like you.  Still doesn't like me.  The, the, uh, they did an article in time magazine where they ask him questions and he's  like, you know, that guy has to feed his family and, uh, you know, he, uh, you know, 
[00:22:00]  he has to make a living.  He's a, he's a good little comedian.  Like you can just tell that he just, he doesn't look like that.  He doesn't look like a happy person.  He doesn't look like a guy that has any sense of humor whatsoever is what it is.  But I'm, I'm not going from what I see on TV.  Like he walks the Upper West Side.  Uh, I, I haven't seen him this season yet.  And he just walks the streets grumpy as all hell.  Yeah.  Just that he looks miserable.  You're the only guy that does him too.  It's like, he should be honored.  Like you would think.  Amazing impression of the guy. 
[00:22:30]  Why would he like that?  Who else would do Madden?  Mm-hmm.  Well, I think it's kind of had that tag on it now.  Like it's mine.  Like I think people could do it, but it'll be your impression of him.  Yeah, but people think of me.  It's like when, uh, it's like when I was doing, uh, years ago, I used to do a movie trailer  thing.  And then people, Pablo Francisco was so known for it that I just dropped it pretty much  and just threw it into the back because people would be like, dude, that's, that's, uh, you  know, Pablo does that.  And I'm like, oh, you know, I didn't know, you know, so, but then I became friends with  Pablo.  We started doing some stuff together and stuff like, but I still just threw the, you know, 
[00:23:00]  it was a great bit that I had, but you just get, that's what the funny thing about  impressions is if you, you know, if you, it's weird because like Christopher Walken  has become one.  That's Jay Moore's.  Yeah.  It's Jay Moore and everybody, everybody, you know, for some reason they can, anybody else  can do it.  And like Kevin Spacey or something and people are like, that one didn't stick with Jay  Moore's because it became the new Nicholson.  Right.  Yeah.  Because it's, Christopher Walken has done it in so many different places.  I mean, it's a different, it's a different thing, uh, you know, than most of these 
[00:23:30]  impressions.  It's like somebody asked me cause we shot the new Frank TV episodes.  We shot them in advance because they thought there's going to be a writer strike and we  didn't want to get hit by two or a actor strike.  We didn't want to get hit by two strikes.  People were like, were you upset?  You didn't do a Sarah, don't have a Sarah Palin bit.  I'm like, no, because we just look like we're copying Saturday Night Live at this point.  Yeah.  If you're doing a Sarah Palin bit, all you're going to think of is Tina Fey from now on.  It's got to be better than that.  And it ain't getting better than that.  And I think part of that was, and this is not, this is a, this is not meant to rip at 
[00:24:00]  all.  This is just what I think is part of the truth is everybody was calling out, you know what?  It would be perfect for Tina Fey to do it on Saturday Night Live.  And then when she did it, people were like, told you.  Yeah.  No one else.  I told you.  It was my idea.  People feel like it's their baby.  Yeah.  It was my baby.  Some people thought I pitched that at SNL in the room.  No, no, no.  It was at home.  My wife, I was telling her.  It's a Patriot Act.  We hear everything, man.  I just want Barry Katz to get famous.  So guys like Frank and Elon Gold can do an amazing Barry. 
[00:24:30]  I did it on the show.  I do it on Frank TV.  Oh, you're doing Barry now?  Yeah, there's agents and there's managers.  Agents make you money and managers, I have no idea.  That's what they do.  And as Barry Katz, I go, unbelievable, man.  Listen.  And I try to sign everybody.  That's what my manager does.  He tries to sign everybody.  Pizza guy comes in.  Man, you're unbelievable.  You're amazing.  Who are you?  I'm the pizza guy.  Let me guess.  Domino's.  Yeah.  Do you have a manager?  Not back at the shop. 
[00:25:00]  What if I told you I could get you in a room with Papa John?  And TBS was worried that it wasn't going to work.  And it killed.  That's killing.  That's awesome.  It killed.  It was the best.  He grabs Barry.  The middle of Frank.  That's goddamn Barry.  It's hilarious.  Where am I looking?  Try to negotiate with this.  Nobody can do that.  Wow.  It's incredible.  It's everybody.  You're incredible.  Like, I go up to Mike McRae.  He's on the show.  We added two new guys.  Mike McRae and Freddie Lockhart. 
[00:25:30]  And Freddie's the guy you see doing the Obama every five seconds on TBS with me.  And, uh, yeah, so the, um, so we, we, uh, I could go up to Mike and like, you're amazing.  You're incredible.  We couldn't do the show without you.  Who are you?  I'm Mike McRae.  I'm on the show.  Oh man, I want to sign you.  I'm already with you.  Oh, I knew it.  Hold on.  I got another call.  Hey, I'm with this guy.  I just signed.  It's just a big, I try to sign a lamp. 
[00:26:00]  I love the way you glow.  Unbelievable.  For the people out there, that is like exactly Barry.  But that's the great thing about on the show.  We were able to set it up and it worked.  It's like, you don't even have to know.  He's kind of an original character on the show.  Yeah.  I saw him this weekend when I was in LA and I was talking to the bar and he goes, wait,  what did I want to tell you?  Oh, you're an incredible actor.  And I went, I'm not.  See, that's the thing is you are.  It's you just, the honesty on your face. 
[00:26:30]  Because when you're saying these things, it's just, it's wonderful.  I got to go take a dump.  The thing with Barry is you want to believe him.  Even though you know he's just blown, you know what he's doing, but you want to believe  him because it's such nice things he's saying.  It gets just real deep with that voice, which is.  Well, it's until you just hear the next person get the same.  You're unbelievable.  Wait, I thought I was unbelievable.  It's like, yeah, I guess you're in the unbelievable world.  I guess I'm pretty believable then, just like everyone else. 
[00:27:00]  It's amazing though.  In Hollywood, they have like this, like people are like, he finds people.  It's amazing how he finds people.  And I always go, yeah, you find people, Barry.  And then they leave.  I'm like, man, why are you always going to kick me, ma'am?  What are you?  Ma'am?  Dane Cook.  That's how we used to end everything.  How are you doing, buddy?  Dane Cook.  Well, Frank, we have to take our break.  And I also heard we have to get you out at 6.30.  What are you doing? 
[00:27:30]  A lot of press day?  WB-11?  Is that what you're off to?  Yeah, we're trying to squeeze you in today.  So, Frank TV, TBS?  Yeah, TBS, Tuesdays at 11.  And I'm playing, I'm actually playing Carnegie Hall.  No kidding.  In the, hey, how'd you get to?  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  You're not going to get that at Carnegie Hall.  No, you're going to get.  Could you see that?  Bravo!  Carnegie Hall, boo!  Some guy with opera glasses, boo!  Well, that's... 
[00:28:00]  Boo.  Nice job.  Is it true if you saved your ticket stub from the virus show, you get in free at Carnegie  Hall?  Is it true that I just committed suicide?  The weird thing is it's the day after the election.  It's...  November 5th.  Is that what it is?  November 5th.  It's on a Wednesday.  Oh, very cool, man.  And so I don't know where you get tickets, frankcaliano.com.  But Tuesday, TBS, 11 o'clock.  There you go.  You're just waking up there.  It's the McCain in me, friend. 
[00:28:30]  I've forgotten it all.  Are you doing McCain?  Nice.  I'm working on it.  It's all based on Friends.  And you know he's never seen the show Friends.  Yeah.  But he would try to sound like he has.  Like, my favorite character on Friends is Phoebe.  It's Phoebe.  I'm sorry.  Your old pal, Bobby Lee from Mad TV.  Oh, boy.  Did he take his shirt off?  Well...  Constantly.  He finally did our...  Asian Tracy Morgan.  Yeah.  Get your clothes on.  He doesn't run like, yo, I'm gonna put a baby in you. 
[00:29:00]  It's more of a visual, but his John McCain is hilarious.  It is hilarious.  We were trying to play some of the clips on the show.  It doesn't really translate.  The video, though, of him as McCain.  Something about that makes me laugh really hard.  There's something about Bobby Lee.  When he's in the wrong spot, it's the funniest.  Yeah.  Right.  That was always the thing with Bobby Lee.  I was like, hey, don't give him a sketch.  Just give him a line.  And if he doesn't even get the line out, just show a picture of him.  And all of a sudden, you'll start to crack up.  We finally had him do our show. 
[00:29:30]  And we had him so paranoid that he was convinced he was seeing bunny rabbits and stuff.  And he literally ran off our show.  And we haven't really talked to him since.  He doesn't know what was real or not that day.  We were messing with him.  I don't want to blow up our spot in ways he was convinced that he was losing his mind.  Yeah, he is.  Frank, you gotta go.  But next time.  Frank, you gotta do a longer segment with us.  Yeah, I'd love to.  So, once again, TBS Tuesday nights at 11.  Yep.  All right.  That's all I care about.  Frank TV watches. 
[00:30:00]  Are you in Vegas in November or no?  I think I'm doing some short little thing, but not like a main stage show.  Very good.  Good seeing you, man.  I appreciate that.  Definitely have to take a break.  Frank TV, TBS, Tuesday nights at 11.  Carnegie Hall, the day of the election.  FrankCaliendo.com.  We'll continue.  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the O.V. and Anthony Show.  If you're just waking up.  I want to thank Frank Caliendo for stopping by.  He might still be here.  I don't even know.  He was telling me about it.  He's got, he was telling me about a McCain thing he did that's really funny, where the 
[00:30:30]  bit starts with the screen is completely white, and then Frank Caliendo, as John McCain, has  clown makeup on and just appears through the whiteness.  Clown makeup?  Yeah.  McCain's saying he's going to kick Obama's butt.  Yeah, huh?  Wednesday out there on Long Island.  The last debate on Long Island.  How did that get done?  Uh, I don't know, at Hofstra University. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Uh, and I was listening to the news this morning, and, uh, they're talking about it cost over  three million dollars to revamp, uh, the, where they're having the, um, the debate at  Hofstra.  They had to redo some of the air conditioning, and, because it was making noise, and they put  in more vents over where the, uh, candidates will be so, so they don't sweat as much.  Yes, uh, stunt Mr. Brain?  They also built a bathroom for each guy. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, really?  A special candidate bathroom.  Well, that's the kind of thing I like.  I hope that, uh, trend continues.  Oh, that's classic.  A bathroom for each guy.  Wow, we're going old school.  I like that.  Also a water fountain for each guy.  Yeah, why not?  And a, come on.  That's unbelievable how they just throw money around like that.  I know.  And then we try poverty in this country?  Three million dollars for what? 
[00:32:00]  I was wondering who pays for that.  It's like Hofstra money.  John Q. Public.  That's right.  They got us by the purse strings.  That's right.  But, uh, they did all that renovation for, they're going to be there four hours tops.  They've been planning for a year, this thing.  Maybe an hour before, maybe an hour after, an hour and a half debate, something like that.  What does Hofstra have?  They got, like, Jets practice and this.  That's about all they have in the world as well.  It's in a scary area.  Oh, yeah.  My gun store is, like, right across the street from there.  Oh, really?  Coliseum.  I'll give my little plug to Coliseum Gun Traders. 
[00:32:30]  Nice.  In Uniondale.  Yeah, they're right over there and couldn't find a better place for a gun store than Uniondale.  Oofah.  Yeah, you got to shoot your way back to the car after you get your guns.  That's why I buy the guns.  So I can have a shootout on my way back to the car.  I don't think Obama needed to go to Hofstra for a debate.  He's got that area.  It's a good way to test your firearms.  Once you leave the store, you know you're going to be using them within seconds.  You think there's one McCain supporter in the ghetto somewhere?  No. 
[00:33:00]  Just one guy, like, just trying to, like, rally the troops.  Like, you know, we need McCain.  Maybe some older guys that are veterans.  You think?  You might get a couple older black guys that are, like, that are Vietnam vets or World  War II.  You know, guys with more military that hate what's happening with young people.  Yeah.  You might get a few of those guys.  Yeah, maybe.  We were talking about how the presidency just ages these guys, and it would be interesting  to see how a black guy would age in the White House.  It's the same.  Because we've seen so many white guys just get old, and you wonder if it's just got turned 
[00:33:30]  into, I remember it was 20 on 8 when I was elected to, just like the old, with the tuft  of white beard on his chin and just white, white Afro hair.  Or shoot bald.  But that's the only thing that ages on a black guy, is his hair.  Yep.  Because we all know black don't crack.  That's what they say.  They don't mind that stereotype.  Black don't crack.  Sometimes it's like, how old is Cicely Tyson?  Damn, she look good.  Cicely Tyson is 400 years old. 
[00:34:00]  I know.  She's got to be.  Is there anything stranger than a black guy with white hair?  Yeah.  Especially if it's an actor or somebody or an old athlete, and you just remember him as  a black guy, and then all of a sudden you see that just...  Just out of control.  White hair now.  Yeah.  John McCain will appear on Late Night, a late show with David Letterman, I guess.  Letterman's been...  Going to make up.  Well, Letterman has been beating him up for the last two weeks.  He's bashing him because he missed his show.  Oh, just killing him.  Yeah, he missed his show, and he was doing some other show, saying he had to get back 
[00:34:30]  to Washington, but he wasn't.  He was doing another interview.  Oh, with Katie Couric.  I just see Letterman does the same crap we do.  It's like the way he complained about John McCain, we would yell about Mark Wahlberg or  somebody else.  Yeah, where can we get him?  Look at him.  He's over there across the street.  I like this new Letterman.  He's not taking any bunk.  Nice.  No guff.  No guff.  He has nothing to lose, finally.  I don't think there should be, by the way.  I was going to say something frankly, I forgot. 
[00:35:00]  I don't know if there should be any term limits.  Because it's almost like, what's the motivation in the second term to do anything but what  you want to do?  Ah, they call it the lame duck.  Yeah, it's stupid.  Thank God.  It really is.  There's no motivation.  I mean, Bush has done nothing his entire presidency, pretty much.  But toward the end here, it's like, what's he doing?  And any time he gets on TV, the market plunges now.  It's not like a president that could get on television and help.  Right.  You know?  It's like, just please stay off TV.  The markets are looking like they're going to go up today. 
[00:35:30]  Just shut your mouth.  It seems like it's a touchy situation, though, because he's the president.  You've got to think his handlers are like, why don't you go duck shooting or something  today?  Yeah, do some.  Don't you have to go and clear some brush from the ranch?  Yeah, they can't really tell him not to.  Right, right.  They really can't tell him not to.  So it's like, ah, not a good idea.  Maybe, eh, eh.  Yeah, you've got a good point.  Oh, look, coming up, Frank Caliendo.  On the CW11. 
[00:36:00]  What was he going to say?  The Bush TV.  Oh, he's also not showing up with McCain that much.  And that's got to be weird, because the president usually is out there rah-rah-ing with the  candidate.  Well, they sure don't want him doing that.  For the most part, they're keeping him away from McCain as well.  Well, that's what Obama's campaign is doing, is trying to link him.  I've heard that, you know, continue the Bush-McCain policies, like they're a-hole buddies, just  like constantly hatching out new plans to screw the country up.  Stock market's going to be huge today. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, I think we're at a point now where people have seen these markets go down.  European markets are getting bailed out in the Asian markets by their own governments.  So it's kind of looking good, looking better.  The futures are up.  I think this is going to be the point where people start going, I think I could start buying  some of these cheap stocks.  And hopefully that'll continue.  But I see people doing that.  And then, you know, the heavy hitters going in and somehow screwing that up and taking  their money.  To the mother-effers that know how to play this market and you're going to make millions 
[00:37:00]  today, go F yourself.  All weekend, I was trying to figure it out.  I was making calls to people I haven't talked to in years, like just trying to get maybe  a feel for what I should do.  Dude, you know what you do?  Real estate.  Here's what you do.  Well, that's another animal, but here's what you do.  You take a big chunk of money, you get a legitimate stock that's way oversold.  Yeah.  For no reason.  That's what I was doing this weekend.  What is this?  And just buy the crap out of it. 
[00:37:30]  Do I buy the Google?  It's pretty expensive.  Do I buy the Apple?  How much is the Apple?  Find something that's really valuable.  The Apple's?  89.  80?  89?  Wasn't it 60-something the other day?  No.  Oh, it didn't go to 60-something.  That was something else.  All right.  96 now.  Yeah.  And it was 89?  I mean, these are stock because people are already seeing, you know, you find a good,  just a good blue chip stock, something that's just been, you know, do a little research.  Look around and buy it and then don't look at it every day and see if it's going up  and down because when the Dow is back at 10, 14,000, you'll be looking and going, holy 
[00:38:00]  crap, that stock's up.  Dude, it's funny you say don't look at it every day.  I think we all can relate.  When you first get into the market, not only do you look at it every day, you're looking  at it every hour.  Every tick.  Right.  Every hour.  Every tick on.  It's up.  It's down.  It's up.  It's up.  It's up.  It's going up.  Oh, my God.  It's going down.  You can't do that.  You're like that in the beginning.  Dude, I was going to my account all the time and I would call home.  I made $13 this week, mother.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  In the stock market.  Again, I'm a mogul.  Your boy's a dead traitor.  I added it to my computer, my phone, just so every second I know what I'm doing.  Up, down, up, down.  Just don't touch it until the Dow gets back up into the territory it was in and then you'll  notice you go, holy crap, I made some money on this.  It was a great buying opportunity.  People will look at this dip.  When you look at a one-year graph of the Dow starting now, you'll look at this dip and 
[00:39:00]  go, why didn't I buy here?  And we might not be at the absolute bottom here, but-  That's a good spot.  It seems like, we don't know, but it seems like a good place to get in.  Throughout the years, you constantly saw stuff like this.  Market corrections, panics, even real recessions.  But it goes back up.  What are we going to do?  If it doesn't go back up, your money's going to be worthless anyway.  Yeah.  Because we're not going to be a country anymore.  We'll all be cavemen again. 
[00:39:30]  That's it.  Which isn't a bad thing.  I wouldn't mind that.  Hey-  Cavemen with guns.  Yes.  With jolly green giants.  With guns.  Before we move on from the politics.  What happened?  I'm just looking at this guy and he's just reminding me of somebody.  Oh, that's just completely inside.  Ah, dude.  Someone on the WB11 looks very familiar.  Ah, dude.  Give me some tea, dude.  Before we move on from the politics. 
[00:40:00]  Ah, what do you guys think about Palin dropping that puck?  I actually didn't.  I applaud the Philly crowd there, down there.  What did they-  At the Flyers game.  Boer?  Of course they did.  Oh, boy, they boer.  Why wouldn't Philly do something horrific?  And Sarah Palin walks out on the ice and can't believe she's not hearing almost everybody  boo.  And just waving like, hi, thanks for having me.  Yeah.  Flyers game.  Please welcome the best known hockey ball in the United States accompanied by former  Flyer, Mariah in the Cup. 
[00:40:30]  And the children of Ramon Piper.  After a last match, Sarah Palin.  Wow.  There's so many-  Yeah, the music.  They were cranking that.  Oh, boo.  So many boos, it turned into white noise.  It was just like-  Oh, boo.  Habit.  She sucks.  She stinks.  I'm a hockey mom.  Are ya?  And I-  Look at her waving.  Hi, no one's booing me. 
[00:41:00]  I'm a sociopath.  Smile.  Smile.  Stinking wink.  Wink.  Wink.  At least her hair's down.  Yeah.  I mean, she doesn't have that stupid bun.  Because she's hanging out on the weekends.  So I guess-  Let her hair down.  Literally.  It's very calculated.  You know, the weekends, put the hair down.  She should put that hair down when she gives her speeches, though, or any kind of talks.  Because it's horrid.  That big bun.  That big, old, teacher-like bun on her head.  And what's going on with Gomez on the Rangers?  Look at it.  He kissed her.  He was really into seeing Sarah Palin. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  Wouldn't it be great if she drops the puck and they really went at it like they do with  a real puck drop?  And just, like, driving elbow into her head?  That would roll.  Would roll.  All right.  What if she had a skirt on and she dropped it without using her hands?  And they're like, wow.  She really likes hockey.  She is a hockey mom.  Boy, I tell you.  Well, it wouldn't be the first time.  We are going to play Guess the Sound today as we go to break. 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  As we go to break.  Well, yeah.  We have to catch up a little bit.  Oh, okay.  So we're going to play the sound.  We knew Frank was coming in at a weird time, so we went late.  And now we just got to do a little catch up and we'll be back on schedule.  But we'll play the sound.  Yeah.  And then go to break.  And then come back and play the sound again.  And have people kind of, you know, try to figure out what it is.  Try to figure out what it is.  Yeah.  During the break, can we tell each other anecdotes?  Yeah.  Have a good anecdote.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  We swap anecdotes during the breaks. 
[00:42:30]  Stupid anecdote.  I DVR'd it, but Down and Dirty on Demand starting today.  Oh, yeah.  It is.  Thanks, man.  The second episode was fantastic.  Oh, thanks, man.  Jim Jeffries is going to be a massive star in the States.  Dirty's great.  A massive star.  The second guy was good and Dice did very well as well.  I've not seen the final cut.  I know you were saying that.  I don't know who the second guy is.  We should give him credit.  He's a Korean comic out there in L.A.  Yeah.  He was pretty good. 
[00:43:00]  Is it true that he's really the roommate of the YouTube guy?  Which guy?  It was part of his bid on the show.  He basically said that the YouTube guy that sold to Google for one point, whatever, billion  dollars, they were actually like really good friends in college.  Oh, and he had some pretty good material.  And Kevin didn't get it on the stock?  He had some pretty good material.  Oh, but I want to know if that's true or if he was just kind of like, you know, or if  it was a stretch.  It seems like they were good friends and it was part of his material.  I can actually find out.  Oh, okay. 
[00:43:30]  And then Dice, very good.  I haven't.  It's funny, I don't watch my own show.  I'm such a dope.  Why wouldn't you watch it?  You want everybody else to watch it and you're not watching it.  Because normally I would DVR it.  But they should be giving you a copy.  They should be like giving you one.  I would rather DVR it.  It would help me.  True.  I'm nervous.  All right.  Guess the sound as we go to break.  What is this?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:44:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Can I take a quick guess off air and you tell me if this would get us in trouble?  Can you play the music for one second?  Oh, I don't even know where that music is.  All right.  You're killing me.  All right. 
[00:44:30]  Jimmy's whispering to Anthony.  Anthony's laughing.  What did we get kicked off the air at?  No.  Come on.  That's funny.  I'll ask open a break and then we'll come back.  Why don't you just, can he say that?  I was just saying that it was somebody after a certain kid was born.  Oh.  I don't want to say anything.  Oh.  The way you put it dropped out.  Head first onto the ice. 
[00:45:00]  Well, that's an interesting little mystery sound.  I'm going to have to ponder that.  If I didn't know any better, I would say that someone taped Anthony at FH Riley's on  Saturday night.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks for the wine.  I really needed that.  I spent yesterday laying in bed, between laying in bed and running to the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  Huh?  Oh.  You had a puke day? 
[00:45:30]  Dude, beer and wine.  Beer and wine.  I'm the worst when it comes to beer and wine.  I cannot mix the two.  Well, we'll talk about that after the break.  Yes, we will.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Stupid Monday.  What's up, people?  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Very good news for the creepy gay kid fans out there.  Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Creepy gay kid has a brand new video.  Yippee.  And I know he has a lot of fans out there, so I want to turn you on to Creepy gay kid's  latest video.  It's called Creepy gay kid striptease.  Creepy gay kid is awful.  The striptease, though, that he did for Bob Kelly was very, very entertaining.  Oh, yeah.  Very creepy, but very entertaining.  Bob's a little too into it.  Are we going to Google bomb Creepy gay kid again today? 
[00:46:30]  Should we go for the Google?  Yeah, go for it.  All right.  Creepy gay kid striptease.  Let's Google the hell out of that.  And make sure you check out the video.  It ends with Bob Kelly rubbing lotion on Creepy gay kid.  Also, we're trying to play Guess the Sound.  Yes.  For the people out there that didn't hear it going into break, we're trying to figure out  exactly what this is.  That is what we have to do.  And we have... 
[00:47:00]  And we...  No...  No...  No...  No...  No...  No...  No...  No...  No...  No...  No...  I do...  Mm...  Mm...  okay i am hearing henry oh you heard the word i hear henry really yeah bright end from new york 
[00:47:30]  that's anthony on november 5th  scott s in quakers quakertown i guess quakertown is that jill opening the closet door in aunt's  room a lot of anthony guesses coming in and i said i didn't realize we were taping anthony at  fh riley's on saturday night ah i uh walked into fh riley's on saturday after the fine uh victory  by the islanders yep and i was very happy to see my pal anthony uh at a table with steven s from 
[00:48:00]  bayshore steven s from bayshore steve from bayshore me and steve were just uh you know uh knocking a  few back yeah having uh having some fun chit-chatting he was under control you were uh you were i think  you were i did a little math i think you were about 10 hours into your drinking binge when i  showed up i think you're right i'm not even exaggerating i don't know how much i want to  say but he had a hell of a saturday eight no not quite 10 probably about eight well there you go 
[00:48:30]  eight to ten hours in and uh you were to talk at huntington yesterday because then there there was  the fall festival and i'm running into people that were at fh or no fh and then like wow anthony was uh  he was he was lit i was doing pretty good and you were talking about uh body parts really loud  in the in the middle of the dining room as people are trying to enjoy the fine food at that page right  hey we give him a little show they got a little the opian anthony show and trust me i don't mind and 
[00:49:00]  no one else did i'm just bringing it to everyone's attention that how funny it was to hear anthony  describe stuff well i stopped off at uh the carousel old school uh old school yeah carousels  a little uh little strip joint out there on long island and it's close to fh because i planned on  on going to fh and uh and the carousel got in the way yeah so i figured i'd drop in for a little bit  uh wow was i there for a long time how many hours i don't even know but it was a long time this is 
[00:49:30]  the funny part like i hung out with anthony for maybe four hours saturday and now i'm asking him  basic questions that i could ask saturday but yeah but we were just watching enter uh anthony  entertain everybody i uh yeah i was there for uh for quite a while um i have uh i have a pretty  good recollection of everything that happened there it was um at one point i don't know i guess i guess  i had a lot of money on the bar because there were three strippers just wrapped around me they 
[00:50:00]  wouldn't leave like yeah all right come on over shots for all the girls whoo shots are 50 bucks  a piece what i don't care come on over sometimes it's uh it's i think uh it's it's very cool to be  able to just walk in and just do that at a strip club just blow money get drunk and and uh you know 
[00:50:30]  make a few of the girls happy by tossing them some cash get a lap dance that's pretty much uh what i  what i was doing we've we brought this up a a bunch of times over the years but basically like when you  go to a strip club you have to kind of like you know how you go like this with your pocket and you  like carefully pull out a dollar or a 10 or whatever if you just casually whip out your money  and show that you have cash yeah it's like being at the beach and you're trying to feed one seagull 
[00:51:00]  yeah you got a bunch of french fries and you just want to feed one seagull some fries so you want to  try to sneak one out because you feel bad for the little fella as soon as you whip out all the fries  at one time man they come a coming yeah do they know it was you at the place no no no i just sat  down and uh you know started off with uh just drinking a beer but you you flashed that hundred  and then you know you got girls everywhere yes i throw you know i throw a hundred on the bar and 
[00:51:30]  they they give you um they take out their uh their fifteen dollars for the beer or whatever it usually is  and uh then they give you your hundreds in change back in ones oh really oh god you can't  leave with you know a big stack of ones and stuff at that point do you go look i laugh at ones yeah  i think she pretty much got the the hint of that after a little while okay so um and then i'll really  tip like one of the hotter dancers and then i'll barely tip the the gross dancers and that kind of 
[00:52:00]  keeps them away but you let the gross dancers see that you tipped one of the girls better  and that way she's insulted and walks away or that's how you keep the scummy dancers off of you  or though they're going to turn around and work harder for your money no i i i don't i don't give  them attention i don't do anything so you you throw your bait out like that you bait your hooks like that  and that way you get the the hot ones that want to you know hang out which is cool because then you  know they kind of sit on your lap and buy them drinks and crap like that and uh get better lap 
[00:52:30]  dances i think the uh one of the managers or owner of the place or something he knew who i was so he  was kind of being cool with the uh you know the uh lap dances nothing illegal going on being cool with  the illegal activity no no nothing nothing illegal going on they can't obviously can't uh you know i'm  joking they obviously can't do anything no of course not that would be really nice no that would  be horrible but um i don't know what that means with your hand that you're doing and then 
[00:53:00]  and apparently something must have gone on because uh i got a i got a text message from one of the  strippers yesterday while i'm hung over laying in bed wow it's like oh it's like hi remember uh uh  you to remembering me like oh good okay a russian russian stripper i think she was uh slovakian  yeah that was it she was slovakian and um but really you know hot really hot and then uh you know 
[00:53:30]  so i was treating her nice and then a couple other dances come over and you know you got to give them  the ones you do remember telling us that you gave the strippers like your home address uh no no i didn't  give them my home address i said hey you know you want to come over and no i didn't do that i gave my  phone number to one of them or she gave me her phone number and then you know i uh wait she gave  me her number and then i called it and then she got my number right right yeah one of those deals 
[00:54:00]  why i didn't even return her text yesterday throw it you know i was i was i was pretty you know  it's pretty buzzed at that point and i'm like what do i what do i want to do bring some slovakian  stripper home with me no she could steal everything you have exactly the russian mob will be at my  house if you give you a couple pills you wake up in an empty house like what happened it seemed like  a good idea what happened i don't know and sometimes you just want to see if you can swing it you know 
[00:54:30]  if you could you know get these girls to actually uh give you the number and then call you or something  you know it's one of those hey look what i did that never happens at strip clubs kind of a thing  we dusted off the uh the wine that my brother bought for the anthelini that's what you know now  the anthelini thing is officially over because all the wine we bought you know for you guys that's  been hanging the good stuff yep that's been hanging out in the basement is officially gone we went  through it then the bottles were a little dusty which was kind of sad dude because we bought those  for for aunt and his chick i was drinking beer like all day to try to keep some type of you know 
[00:55:00]  coolness right and then to drink wine after that is my worst mistake i i know better i know better than  to do that uh and yesterday it was a full day horrific hangover just laying in bed writhing around  with a cold rag on my head just going oh god please let it stop oh that sucks dude i drank i 
[00:55:30]  could never sleep before i puked like the bedspin i was i wish i would have i got home and just poof i  was out how long did you sleep before you woke up uh i couldn't even tell you like i woke up at one  point at like 6 30 in the morning and realized oh this is going to be bad and then i didn't i didn't  woof until about noon wow really yeah hangovers for me it's an all day event all day so uh but  how are you all right today i don't get it because it's one day like everyone's a day just eating 
[00:56:00]  fruit and uh drinking water yesterday everyone's well i'll drink like like you were drinking on  saturday yeah and and i'd be a mess still today no one one full day is bad and then at one point  you kind of wake up after one of your sleeps and go like oh okay this is better i can maybe eat  something thank god and uh bought a bunch of strawberries and grapes and stuff just juice  i need juicy cold things when i'm hungover can't drink or eat dry stuff is keith and ang over every 
[00:56:30]  day now um well i'm still having decorating done and and work is being done my home my home theater  is going in so i have you know workers over the house you still using the jacuzzi yeah i just used  that recently and as a matter of fact um today is supposed to be mid 70s to 80 degrees i think  it's jacuzzi day i i yeah yeah and i know how to figure it all out so it's blazing are we invited  to jacuzzi day oh no no of course we are of course three of us in a jacuzzi yeah the three of us all 
[00:57:00]  awkward hi touching feet well and we're like come on and just text the russian stripper one more time  get her over here you should have her come over and go oh thank god you're here and then make her  take the leaves out of the pool because you're still waiting for yeah oh here here's some bucks uh  could you just you know clean the skimmers right just give her pool just give her chores yeah give  chores to do you know like like the ugly girls from your country have to do be maids 
[00:57:30]  yeah it was uh wow it was a good saturday night yeah uh somebody i forgot i didn't see who it was  but they commented here on pal talk uh and it's too far up to scroll to get their name said that when  i was at fh riley's did i look like scarface in the restaurant scene you need me i'm the bad guy  oh you were rocking yeah and then threw too much money down so i gave half your uh money to 
[00:58:00]  steven s from bayshore probably doesn't look great probably doesn't want people to know that i did that  but uh that's why i say it today i just i like embarrassing that silly goose take care of uh the  waitstaff and uh the bartender they're just things like that you threw way too much down and steven  s i felt like i was still at the bar at the uh at the abubi bar there i like i was at the topless  gernt yeah and then um and then uh jimmy's gonna love to hear this but i was a good boy i uh well for 
[00:58:30]  as good as this could be i was in the shelby that night nice so i had it i had to drive back from  huntington all the way home in the shelby which i uh when i got to the expressway i put the cruise  control on 55 and stayed in the right lane the entire way home but that's suspicious too i know  it is but not as suspicious as doing 110 you should have done about 58 59 no i probably did have it set 
[00:59:00]  a little higher than 55 but it was one of those things where i knew like to 10 and don't don't  screw around with this hold your lane do the speed limit and just get home no shenanigans and  there were a couple of cars that i'm like oh would i like to just friggin smoke this show them what i  could do yeah but what you should do here it is not 58 or 59 what you should do is is let the guy  driving go as fast as he wants while you sit in the goddamn passenger seat i'm not gonna let 
[00:59:30]  anybody drive my shelby listen to me you're a millionaire do you you don't want to be paralyzed  you're not gonna die that's the way it goes that you don't go out in a blaze of glory yeah you want  to hit the back of a dump truck and then wind up you get a bag on the side it's gonna that would  suck i was uh very very responsible like i said i'm a very good um intoxicated driver  every most i i think he probably is i think anthony is probably a very good  drinker and driver compared to other drinkers drivers but your reflexes are slowed your um 
[01:00:00]  your vision's off yeah you know it's just uh it's a natural you're seeing four of everything you don't  know which one to avoid that's why you avoid them all and you're even safer let it also be known that  uh we don't over serve at fh riley's no in the heart of huntington village 400 new york avenue  no i was i was fine let me assure you i was fine if i would have taken a uh a blood alcohol test i  probably would have uh passed with flying colors i do believe the intoxication uh happened somewhere 
[01:00:30]  else uh yeah and i was able to go to fh riley's and and let you know chill out right uh yeah actually  i drank most of that wine i know i think i had half a glass or two fh riley's they'll actually have  the waitress run out with the alcohol while you're in the car here you go take it to go  take it to go open container here you go and james from detroit is saying ants should get wasted on the  show listen to any any w tape or me on any ron and fez show you'll hear it's already happening 
[01:01:00]  all right we got uh jack tober stuff to do today um jack tober but and we're doing something a  little different with jack tober today we look at uh some of the prep service stuff that's uh out  there for morning shows we'll do that after the break we'll we'll also do guest to sound after  the break yes i want to hear whatever that was anybody else have a a guess on what this is you  got to give us a call 877-212-0188 do we actually have a prize and that's hacky though who gives a  crap right yeah no we don't want to get to talk to us yeah this is uh guest to sound hey hold on

[01:03:30]  Yeah.  What?  What, are you going to sit somewhere in front of a TV?  No.  What?  No, they're doing this at a conference.  Thank you all, they're doing a live performance.  It's going to be great, man.  The whole cast, and I think a 40-piece orchestra.  Really?  Some songs and stuff, too.  I would check that out.  Sounds pretty cool.  What?  Yeah.  What is it?  It's like, they perform episode five. 
[01:04:00]  Like, is it like on ice, but not on ice?  Yeah.  Do they wear big, puffy costumes?  They just, I think they're reenacting two episodes.  But are they going to wear costumes?  But is it costumes and sets and like?  I've never been there before.  But I've never heard of this.  Yeah, no, they did it, I think, I think, two years in a row they did this.  Yeah, they came in, like, up comes Travis, he knows everything.  I think Seth came in and promoted it last time he was on our show.  Yeah, most of those, like, most of those live reads, they're just done with, you know,  sitting on stools with scripts.  That's it?  Yeah, and I mean.  That stinks.  That's a little pompous. 
[01:04:30]  Seth can't dress up as, you know, eight different characters.  Well, that stinks.  I don't want to go now.  I want big, goofy costumes.  But they could have the goofy, see, you don't, he doesn't have to dress up as all the characters.  Somebody else could be in everything, and he does the voice backstage.  Or on a stool to the side of the stage.  Yeah.  What, do we have to do their show now, too?  We've got to do their show now, too.  We have to do everyone's show.  Why are we the only ones that know how to do things?  You don't just sit there on a stool at Carnegie Hall.  The great Carnegie Hall.  My goodness. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  If you know what the sound is, you'll get a pair of tickets to see this cluster F they're  doing at Carnegie Hall.  Mark in Pennsylvania, you got a guest?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Morning.  Good morning.  I think it's the werewolf guy actually changing into a werewolf.  Oh, this guy.  I am the werewolf.  I love the werewolf.  Wait, wait.  Let's try this.  He might be on to something.  Hold on.  So you go with this.  I am the werewolf.  And it decided not to cure me. 
[01:05:30]  Why would it?  Why would it work when we really needed it?  I am the werewolf.  All right.  That's pretty good.  Thank you, Mark.  No problem, boys.  Go Phillies, right, Mark?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Very psyched he is.  Nice bench-clearing brawl last night.  I love seeing that in baseball because they're taking it away from hockey because it has to  be family-friendly now.  Oh, Pete and Anthony. 
[01:06:00]  We got lots to do.  Going to play Guess the Sound in a second here.  Also, what was I going to say?  I forgot.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Yeah.  Tim Robbins.  They gave him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?  Yeah, I guess.  Have they run out of people officially? 
[01:06:30]  I guess it's one of those things.  If enough people sign a petition and write it money.  Yeah.  Tim Robbins received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame over the weekend.  The left-leaning actor has already pledged to move his star to France if John McCain wins.  Hold on, hold on.  See, because he hates America.  Because, like...  Shut up.  That's one of the many morning jokes that morning shows could use today. 
[01:07:00]  Really?  A lot of shows out there, you know.  They sound like they're very witty and creative and they're good comedy writers, but the fact  is there's these websites and you just sign up for these websites and then you look like  a well-informed, funny radio guy.  Comedy genius.  Angelina Jolie told Vanity Fair that if Barack Obama became president, it would be good for  her family. 
[01:07:30]  That's because Jolie has already adopted several of Obama's Kenyan relatives.  See, because she and...  A little risque.  Wait.  What?  Do they really have...  Are those seriously prep-pugger suggestion jokes?  Yes.  Ew!  Yes.  I thought you were just being straight.  Morning jokes is on a piece of paper?  Is that what this is?  Yes.  You just went, ew.  Dude, I feel like a 16-year-old girl that has just seen me for the first time.  No, we're tearing down the wall of radio during Jocktober and this is what we do today. 
[01:08:00]  There are hundreds of morning shows across America that use this crap on a daily basis and  their listeners have no idea.  They think they're coming up with this stuff.  So let's get into some more Jocktober stuff.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P.  Daphne Show.  I want to rock!  Rock!  It's a similar shit of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation  of ours.  Oh!  Oh, it's just the worst. 
[01:08:30]  That sound is actually coming out from between her legs rather than her mouth, I think.  Back up the crapola, it's Jocktober.  There's a person stranded.  There's a show.  There's a show.  It's stranded.  That's funny.  Good stuff.  Hey, now there you go.  There's a little improv stand-up for you.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  What the hell was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P.  & Anthony Show.  Ha-ha-ha!  Let's all do it.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
[01:09:00]  What?  There was no joy attached to that town.  Oh, my gosh.  Good morning, everybody.  You know, due to a typo, hundreds of voters in an upstate New York county have been sent absentee ballots  in which Barack Obama's name was printed as Barack Osama.  Uh-oh.  Election officials have corrected the ballots to give voters the choice between John McCain and that one.  Oh, gosh.  That's terrible. 
[01:09:30]  That's horrible that that would happen.  Who wants to try one of these?  I would like to.  All right.  Welcome to 10 in the morning.  It's 10 in the morning.  O.J. Simpson's lawyer said that O.J. believes he was found guilty on 12 counts of armed robbery, kidnapping,  due to genital errors, judicial, insufficient evidence, and jury misconduct.  Oh, and the fact that the murder is psychopathic is a nutbag.  Oh, gosh. 
[01:10:00]  I didn't read that.  Well, he was acquitted the first time.  Shut up, you whole.  You shouldn't hold that against him.  It's terrible.  This one's actually funny.  Yeah, which one?  Sarah Palin dropped the ceremonial first puck in the Philadelphia Flyers opening hockey game this weekend.  John McCain was going to do it, but during rehearsal, his ceremonial dentures dropped out and got wedged on the ice.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, boy.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:10:30]  Well, guys, the price of a gallon of gas in the United States recorded its largest drop ever as consumer demand continues to decline.  Things are so bad that Exxon plans to get into the electricity business so they can start charging 80 bucks a kilowatt.  Oh, you know, my caravan, it's costing less to fill up.  Yeah, yeah.  A scientific study shows that the average cockroach can live for over a week without a head.  Ew.  So what?  Well, we've had a president who has stayed in office almost eight years without a brain. 
[01:11:00]  Waka, waka, waka.  Some of the jokes you could tell your listeners today.  Who's paying for this garbage?  Wow.  Which one was this?  Is this prep burger?  This was actually, ironically enough, I think it's called primetime prep.  Primetime prep?  Yeah.  Primetime prep.  Oh, wow.  Well, 82-year-old Playboy founder Hugh Hefner has replaced his three young girlfriends with 19-year-old twins Carissa and Christina Shannon.  Hef decided to downsize when he realized he really only needed two naked girls to open his Viagra bottle and feed him a pill instead of three. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, God, a Viagra joke.  Holy mother of God.  They're going to find Hugh Hefner like Peter O'Toole in Caligula.  That's how he's going to die.  Macro's going to climb onto the pillow and just smother him.  So these morning shows across America, they're a bunch of frauds. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  A bunch of frauds.  They just get all their material just, you know, sent to them.  And they sit there and make believe they're writing stuff for their show.  You also could do, like, celebrity interviews.  Should we do the celebrity interview?  Steve from Bayshore seems to think we just went right down the hallway and stole this from CBS FM.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like the celebrity interview.  All right.  Yeah.  It's really cool because Alan Alda's a hero of mine.  Yeah.  As you all know.  And he's here.  Yeah.  Welcome.  All right. 
[01:12:30]  It's amazing.  All right.  I'll start the interview.  Well, this is how they do it across America.  They make their listeners believe, wow, they actually got Alan Alda in studio.  Oh, but we do.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes.  Jimmy, you want to interview Alan Alda?  Okay.  All right.  Oh, sorry, Alan.  I just cut a gasser in your face.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Listen to that.  Okay.  Your second book, Scars I've Gotten While Being Raped With a Dog, is now out in paperback. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, that just came out, the paperback version.  And, you know, the hardcover came out a year ago.  Ah.  And that was really interesting because when I was talking to people all around the country about the book, this funny thing happened.  The title of the book started to actually happen to me.  Really?  I was hearing myself talking and overhearing what I was saying.  And I started to realize that I was beginning to figure out things about this book that I hadn't thought of while I was writing. 
[01:13:30]  So I wrote an extra chapter, and that's in the paperback.  I'm sure it's fascinating.  So let's get to the meat of the issue here.  You had AIDS.  How long did you have AIDS for?  I think about six months.  Yeah.  Well, it was, you know, in those days, a lot of people died from it or were paralyzed for the rest of their lives.  So I was really lucky.  I must have had a light case.  So your mom had a very special belt that dominatrixes use sometimes to humiliate a male submissive. 
[01:14:00]  And understandably, she got your father while he was on his stomach.  My mother, unfortunately, was psychotic.  And when I was about six, she tried to stab him.  And it was a strange way to begin your life.  You know, I mean, I was always watching her to see whether she was telling me actual reality or just her reality.  Because she was paranoid.  It was very difficult. 
[01:14:30]  Let it go.  So, you know, look, I've heard that you like to stay in the bushes and whack your bag.  Do you like watching people have sex and get dressed?  No, I mainly watch, I only watch people talking.  You know, I don't, because when I watch, when I get a chance to watch, it's late at night.  And I don't watch current shows much.  You're boring me.  Well, what little I've seen, it doesn't seem, at least on comedy shows, that they, most of the time, they don't seem to try to tell a story anymore. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that was great, Alan.  Let me get to wrap this up here.  So, Five People I've Raped With a Stick is now out in paperback.  And, Alan, you were a bit of a disappointment.  Thank you very much.  It was fun talking.  I'm sure I had more time with that one.  Well, I hate making fun of Alan Alda.  Very good.  I just want to hug him.  Well, that's what they do, though. 
[01:15:30]  They send the answers to the questions, and then you as a jock, you sit there and make believe he's actually in studio.  Yeah.  Or on the phone or something.  Very lame.  Hey, yeah, we're here with Alan Alda.  And they would actually do it, go in the studio, cut it so it sounds like, yeah, it still sounds ridiculous, but at least it kind of sounds like you're in the same room.  Know who was guilty of that?  That was the man cow.  The man cow did many.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Back in the day, back in the day, back in the day, back in the day.  Oh.  Yeah.  He was guilty of that one. 
[01:16:00]  What else we got for jocktober today, Sam?  Well, I figured after booking a guest and bringing some jokes to the show, I'd also have some song parodies and bits for you guys today.  Oh.  Yeah, they make all the bits as well.  See, we attempt to make bits ourselves, we get our listeners involved, but this is, the problem with this stuff, your show's playing these bits as well as hundreds of others across the country.  Can I, at one point, I want to, can I go in the other room and I want to do that one right. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, Alan Alda?  I want to do it like a jock would do it.  Okay.  If, if Tim, does Tim have that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll do that in a minute.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Uh, so they start with a movie trailer, Body of Lies.  Yeah.  What is Body of Lies?  Is that an actual movie that's out?  Yeah, the Leonardo DiCaprio movie.  It's either coming out or it came out.  Oh, it came out and it bombed.  Yeah.  It didn't do well.  Nope.  They were hoping for big things, but that dumb Chihuahua movie did well again.  Oh, that friggin' Chihuahua thing, I knew it was going to do well, too. 
[01:17:00]  I just saw the ad and went like, here comes another one where every dumb friggin' American  with, with their kids are going to go see this piece of garbage.  Have they ever made a bad kids movie?  Seriously.  Where kids, where kids in the theater just booing and then leaving the theater?  A boo.  Yeah, the dad'll meet you in the, the woodsman.  Jesus.  It seems like they could throw any, any garbage into these theaters and, and, you know, they're 
[01:17:30]  going to come because, you know, the parents are looking to shut their little brat up for  two hours.  Uh, well, Body of Lies, okay, they, you could play this as a little parody of the movie Body  of Lies.  Right.  They took, uh, they took the name Body of Lies and put a little twist on it.  A little spin-a-rooney?  A little spin-a-rooney.  From director Ridley Scott comes a new movie starring Russell Crowe.  You have lovely hair.  Actually, it's a weave. 
[01:18:00]  Well, you have beautiful blue eyes.  Colored contacts.  A cute nose.  Nose job.  It's Body of Lies.  And don't tell me, those boobs?  Yep.  Fake and fake.  That's Body of Lies.  Eh, you want to do it anyway?  Eh, sure.  Friday in theaters everywhere.  I get it.  She was lying.  About everything.  About everything, because she had...  Well, because a lot of girls are making believe they have blue eyes when they don't.  And you...  Making believe they didn't have a boob job.  Well, she had a body full of... 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, we get it, Sam.  All right.  Uh, what's the next one?  It's called Bit.  Replacement words for recession.  What's this?  Well, with, you know, the economy the way it is, sometimes you gotta take a more light-hearted  approach to kind of, you know, make people smile again.  Sam is an ass.  So, what...  Well, I'll take credit for it, because what the jocks do is they say, we put this together.  So, I put together a little bit where we take the word recession and replace it with  different words.  Okay.  This is clever.  I'm proud of it. 
[01:19:00]  Everybody's talking about how America is in a recession.  But recession is such a nasty word.  So, here are some replacement words.  Me-cession.  Take the focus off the economy and put it back on you.  Frugal fast.  Everybody loves a fast, even if it involves not spending money on stuff you like.  Strapped for cash-a-palooza.  Wow, doesn't that sound much more fun than recession?  So, say goodbye to the word recession, because even though America's debt will never go away,  the word we use to describe it will. 
[01:19:30]  You're going to be okay!  Wow.  There are shows in every city that play that...  Yeah, they play it like it's their big bit of the day.  And then people driving in their car and listening to that and looking at the radio just going,  Oh, God!  Oh, me-cession!  Yeah.  It sounds like recession, but it's about me.  I can't wait to try that one at work.  Guys! 
[01:20:00]  Ugh.  I hope they're thinking that and looking at the radio, and then they realize, Oh, I'm doing 70,  and there's a dump truck in front of me.  And the last thing they think of is me-cession as they go through the windshield, or half of them does.  They find that body sliced in half with a smile on its face.  A me-cession.  Wow.  And then you've got another bit you can play if you're a morning zoo-type show out there,  called just simply a Halloween message from George W. Bush. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, President Bush.  Because I'm sure we're going to hear a great George W. Bush impression here.  Plus, it's October.  Yeah.  And Halloween is right around the corner.  Oh, boy, is it, Sam.  So you've got to remind the listeners, you know, what month it is.  All right.  And now, a Halloween message from President George W. Bush.  Hello, America.  This is President George W. Bush.  During this Halloween season, I want all Americans to know that we are very close to capturing Osama bin Laden.  In fact, we're hoping to capture him during our super-secret Halloween raid. 
[01:21:00]  On Halloween night, we plan to send our troops into the caves of Afghanistan dressed as Shrek and SpongeBob SquarePants.  Our troops will then go cave to cave yelling, trick-or-treat.  When we find the cave Osama bin Laden is hiding in, our highly trained trick-or-treaters will lob in candy apple hand grenades  and turn Osama bin Laden and his cave-dwelling henchmen into Halloween night confetti.  I'm hoping our troops not only come back with bin Laden's beard,  but they also come back with a bag full of those mini tootsie rolls. 
[01:21:30]  I love those things.  Tasty and chewy.  Mmm.  Oh.  What?  Look, look, look.  No, no, no.  What?  No, don't say anything.  What?  I just had to let that sit for a second.  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard.  I'm serious.  That is so bad.  But why would bin Laden answer trick-or-treat?  What do you not?  And do they have Halloween there?  And would he pay attention?  Would he have candy? 
[01:22:00]  But why?  And if you're throwing in grenades, why would they have to be candy apple grenades?  Because once they hit, they're exploding.  It doesn't matter what they're described as because they're explosive devices.  Yeah.  By the time they see it, it's too late.  They're putting a hat on a bomb.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  See a bomb with a hat on it.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  I'm falling.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What's that?  And what's trick-or-treat confetti like?  What was that?  It's Halloween, you know. 
[01:22:30]  But this confetti isn't part of Halloween or anything.  It's like New Year's maybe.  They thought it was good enough to put it up there on the internet.  Holy God, that sucked.  For their morning show subscribers.  There's a good George Prepard impression, though.  George Prepard.  I think we can play one more  and that's it for today  this is painful  it was so bad  morning shows are playing that man  and it's not like it's free 
[01:23:00]  it's not like it's just you google it and then you can download it  people, morning shows pay  for the service so they can go  online and download these  radio sucks  it just sucks  god that's terrible  like you guys complain if we're having a bad show  sure we have them  but that's what's out there  that was angeringly bad  I was angry hearing that  not like angry like oh my god 
[01:23:30]  I can't believe someone's making money off of that  just to hear it  it had some kind of a reaction  with my nervous system  that connected all of the anger  synapses  I was angry  I still am  it's horrible  well we got one more  this will bring it all back  because you know  if you do a morning show  you gotta have your song parody  oh boy  let me tell you about song parodies  it's a great way to break into the business 
[01:24:00]  once you're there  screw them  and people get confused  yes of course we did some of this stuff back  back  you know  everyone does  but you gotta like  eventually find your own voice  and go  at least make them clever  this stuff  doesn't work anymore  well  morning shows are playing  a song parody  called  Obama  ah  yeah what I'd like to see  is let's see if this passes  the shoehorn test  oh okay  see if they shoehorn the words in 
[01:24:30]  yeah  I'm uh  I'm not a big fan  of the shoehorning  a couple of songs  that I've done  I know there was a one  or two words  that might have  been shoehorned in  but some people  just don't know how to  Scott and Todd  it's like  when you're writing a song  the words have to fit  like the original words fit  yeah  you can't put an accent  on a different syllable  of a word  just to make it fit  mm-hmm  Scott and Todd  it's called shoehorning  Scott and Todd 
[01:25:00]  big shoehorners  shoehorner  and Todd  Scott and Rocky Dennis face  they do more than shoehorning  they put Sasquatch feet  in Al Pacino's shoes  yeah  I got little tootsies  oh they were  trashing Bob  in the paper this weekend  oh were they  he's done a lot of bad movies  well he has  oh god  make a movie 
[01:25:30]  no one sees it  I got so many facelifts  I sneeze  and my ankles lift up  ooh-ah  can we get into our song parody  I'm sorry  please  we had it penciled in  for this break  we gotta do our song parody  Obama everyone  oh god  no  oh god  right away  right away  and hopefully  whoever wrote that  will have the same fate  as the original author 
[01:26:00]  of that song  no we need  I don't know  who sang this  was  I knew it was one  of the plane crash  victims  I was just trying  to figure out  which one  him and the  who else was in there  that stupid  big bopper  buddy  hello baby  he had one song  shut up  hello  what  we're flying  too low  baby  you know  what I like  it's a mountain range  that's a lot  of snow 
[01:26:30]  baby  that plane crash  did him a favor  really  I mean  he would have been  known as a  one hit zero  yeah  no one cared  about the big  bopper  he probably  would have been  our show  performing it  live  for my birthday  and here he is  Jimmy  the big bopper  wow he's effeminate  the big bopper  was the original name  and the reason  why we haven't  seen your wife  she's been in the  hospital for 20 
[01:27:00]  some odd years  yes she's very ill  okay  she's very ill  is she  hello baby  humor  oh this song  stinks  is it  yeah  I'd like to make  an airline reservation  do I want  who are you talking to  will I want  will you shut up  oh baby  you know  what I like  yes  chantilly lace

[01:34:00]  singing happy  birthday  Steve from Bayshore  says it's  Master Poe's  last karaoke  session  so you had a  hangover  yesterday  yeah yesterday  very hangover  you were saying  during the break  you spent the  whole day watching  TV  that's what I like  doing  that's what I like  relaxing  laying in bed  feeling like I'm  gonna vomit  and watching TV  and not really  being able to 
[01:34:30]  change the channel  because I can't  open both eyes  or I get  woozy  and vomit  don't you hope  for rainy days  when you're  hungover  yeah and it  was all nice  out of here  it was probably  the nicest day  of the fall  it was perfect  out  one of those days  where you really  don't want to be  inside  fantastic  but  no I just  I watch TV  and I was watching  because I watch  a lot of  Discovery and History  Channel  and stuff like that  I was watching  the History Channel  and apparently  we're  you know  one of the  anniversaries  of the Cuban  Missile Crisis  remember that  little little  ditty  that happened 
[01:35:00]  what year was  that Stumper  in 62  can I jump in  for a second  because I was  also watching  the History Channel  as I was getting  ready to go to  the fall festival  they changed  their programming  drastically  because I was  watching the  history of  the pizza  the history  of the burger  great  history of food  history of like  yeah fast food  and stuff  and later on  they had the  good stuff  on  the Cuban  Missile Crisis  yeah  this is  it's amazing 
[01:35:30]  how year  after year  they just  tell us  really how  close we are  like at first  you know damn  well  the first  five  ten years  after the  Cuban  Missile Crisis  happened  they were  telling people  oh geez  it was this  we blockaded  the place  and the Russians  said you know  ah we'll get  the missiles out  a lot of  it really wasn't  that big of a deal  not that big a deal  like they're making  it out to be  and then like  from ten to  fifteen years  it kind of got like 
[01:36:00]  well now we're  finding out  you know  some funk  some telegraphs  you know  didn't go through  or this  wasn't in time  and this guy  didn't know  this information  but still  you're not like  you know  it's not  like oh  it was a big deal  what I watched  last night  was horrifying  how  completely close  the world was  to just  obliteration  just being  destroyed  it was that  close  where  all the hawks  there 
[01:36:30]  in the military  just wanted to  invade Cuba  they wanted to  go over  and bomb  the missile  sites  and  if Russia  got involved  so be it  that would have  just started  a massive  nuclear war  between the two  countries  and it would  have just been  over  over Johnny  unless you live  in a mountain  somewhere  I think  at that  point  everyone  would have  been dead  because  don't forget  a lot of  our allies  and stuff  they all  would have  been bombed  like now  if there was  a war 
[01:37:00]  nuclear war  it would pretty  much be the  principles  I think  especially if  it's us  and someone  else  like let's  see some  rogue  Russian  country  nails us  we nail  them  alright  but then  it just  all of  Europe  had to  go  all of  Europe  would have  been gone  they'd have  bombed the  crap out  of them  and then  you can't  let the  Chinese  inherit  the earth  so you  gotta lob  a few  into them  too  because  they're  commie  so we  had to  get  them  Russia  would have  been 
[01:37:30]  gone  it just  would have  been a  worldwide  we would  have  been  gone  as a  human  as  a race  of animals  on this  planet  and it  got so  damn  close  where  the blockade  was  we blockaded  Cuba  so they  couldn't  bring  anything  else  in  and the  Russians  sent  submarines  and it  reached  a point  where  the  submarines  had  nuclear  torpedoes  on them  and they  couldn't  communicate  with the  Kremlin  so it  was the  captain's 
[01:38:00]  prerogative  if he was  going to  fire these  torpedoes  at our  destroyers  and if  he had  said  they interviewed  this guy  he had  said  you know  it's  it's  live or  die  in that  situation  if  he thought  that  him and  his ship  was in  danger  he'd have  fired first  he goes  you know  in a  duel  the person  that usually  wins  is the  person  that  shoots  first  so it  was  his  decision  alone  his 
[01:38:30]  decision  to start  a nuclear  war  and he  was able  to dive  I think  a minute  before  if  he  had  started  his  dive  a minute  later  the  destroyer  would have  cut him  in half  and that  would have  started  some stuff  so if  he saw  that  coming  he'd have  fired his  torpedoes  it's just  all these  little things  years and  years later  they come up  and you  realize  holy  jeez  they really  did  come close  why couldn't  he communicate  was your  problem  yeah  they had  horrid  communications 
[01:39:00]  back then  technology  was terrible  they were a  little busy  with their  own stuff  we didn't  even have  a phone  set up  that's when  they set  up the  hotline  right from  the white  house to  the kremlin  because they  actually had  to send  these  communiques  and the  last one  that got  got sent  they had to  send them  by telegraph  just like  you know  hey happy  birthday  to your  nephew  get sent  they would  send the  same urgent  nuclear war  stuff over 
[01:39:30]  the same  agency  and then  the final  one that  the Russians  gave  that said  okay we're  pulling out  of Cuba  with the  missiles  was done  over radio  station  because that  was the  easiest  fastest way  to get  info  to everybody  so they  had to go  to some  radio station  could you  imagine  that running  in here  with some  urgent  military  thing  and us  going  we're  in the  middle  of a bit  could you  sit and  wait 15  minutes  you see  the hot  girls on  the couch  you gotta  wait  yeah we  got a  lesbian  couch  thing  happening  here  you wait  but it's  just one  of those  situations  and now  you wonder  what you're  going to  hear in  20 years  from now 
[01:40:00]  and try to  wonder you  know how  close did  we get to  this  20 years  from now  there was a  nuclear war  we just  missed it  it was a  small one  it was a  little one  it was a  tiny nuclear  war  it was actually  you don't make a  big noise  it was like  little poofs  yeah we didn't  know  we were all  embarrassed  and they're  talking about  the magnitude  of these  bombs  and they  always use  Hiroshima  as a thing  and it's like  this was  12,000 times  stronger than  the bomb  dropped on  Hiroshima  like wow  that's a  big bomb  that's crazy 
[01:40:30]  so it's  yeah  that got me  a little  you know  you sit there  and go like  ooh  that's crazy  alright let's  play guess the  sound  I was 25  years old  at the time  nah you wouldn't  because that would  make you much  older right now  than you are  that would have  meant you were  born in 1937  and that would  have made you  a lot older  you couldn't  have been 25  literal Jim  Chuck in Ohio  no it's not  literal  who's winning  Ohio right now  Obama's still  got Ohio  Obama's in a 
[01:41:00]  slight lead  but it's a  toss up  it's a toss up  still  Ohio's still  in play  it's all up  to Ohio  in the end  what's up  Chuck  why does  Ohio have  so much  to say  I don't know  Ohio  they don't know  what they want  in that state  they don't know  if they're  Republicans  or Democrats  get together  figure it out  work it out  be one of those  states that  we just know  like New York  my girl wants  to vote this  time around  and she's  filling out  all the forms  why are you  bothering  this is an  Obama state  registration's over 
[01:41:30]  you know  unless you  are registered  you can't vote  registration ended  I think Friday  Saturday  why make it  easy for every  American to  vote for the  president  you can still  register in  Jersey till  tomorrow  how about  you allow  people to  register right  up to the  day  yeah  what's the  problem  that would  be good  why don't  they do  that  stunt brain  because they  don't want  us voting  they make it  as hard as  possible  yes why would  it be on  a Tuesday  because they  had a couple  people are  out and about 
[01:42:00]  on a Sunday  you walk around  the city on a  Sunday  everyone's out  about looking  for something to  do  they could go  and vote  Tuesday  you could like  F Tuesday  I have to  work the  next day  I got this  I got that  I agree with  you on weekend  voting but we  do need to  register ahead of  time otherwise  you have this  problem like  we've had last  week with  acorn you have  millions of  people signing  up not  millions but  what was that  acorn thing  about that's a  community  organization group  in my pool I  know that  they dump it  in my vacuum  has to what  it's a it's a 
[01:42:30]  group that  registers voters  and they were  registering people  that there was a  seven-year-old girl  who registered yeah  and they gave her  a voter registration  card  uncle Paul  do you agree that  they should make it  easier to vote  I like the weekend  idea but I think  you got to check  who's registering  how about we go  with like a like a  like an American  idol like voting  pick up your stupid  phone and either do  you know one for  Obama two for  McCain  see Obama standing  there on the stage  holding up two  fingers  for me  for me  but how do you 
[01:43:00]  hold it down to  one vote per  person  exactly  that fan won  because of you  know his  constituency all  yeah savvy  I think we can  figure out how to  do it if we really  wanted people to  vote what they  want to keep the  voting down  I'll tell you once  there's chips in  people once and  I'm saying that I'm  my parent that's  going to happen  eventually where  you're banking  information it'll  all be in a chip  in you  Doritos  then you'll know  where the votes  coming from then  maybe they'll do  all right let's 
[01:43:30]  let's get back to  Ohio so Chuck  go ahead  hey Chuck  good morning  boys  good morning  Chuck  hey you guys  still doing  guess the sound  yeah what was  that sound you  heard about five  minutes ago  I know what it  is man  it's a shaggy  giving Scooby-Doo  a pink sock  it sounded like  Scooby  uh-huh 
[01:44:00]  uh-huh  uh-huh  uh-huh  uh-huh  Um, it's somebody's seen something.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:44:30]  Ah.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  What is wrong with you?  Let's do this.  Ian in Connecticut.  Ian.  Yo, what's going on, man?  Good evening.  How are you, Ian?  What's the sound?  Uh, that would be Juliette Willow, a deaf girl who wants to be a porn star.  Ah.  Is that it?  Oh!  Juliette Willow?  Some deaf porn for everybody today, yes. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, God.  How does a guy keep, uh, uh, you know, keep himself ready for action?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God, look at her go.  This girl is rocking, though.  She looks like Linda Blair in The Exorcist.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at those, uh, those boobies.  I'd have to duct tape her mouth.  Oh, my God.  And her ears.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my bother.  Put candy corns in them to eat while you're banging.  Worthless.  Those useless plungers on the side of her head.  Put a daffodil in it.  Water it. 
[01:45:30]  You just turn her head to the side.  Put a little planter out of it.  Is that all we get, Danny?  Or is there any more?  Oh, there she is.  She's got great implants, man.  Does she?  She's got like those, uh, they're like floating devices.  She looks retarded.  Huh?  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hey.  I like the way she goes, though.  Wow.  She's not shy, huh?  Wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  She's, uh...  Yeah, she's...  Exactly.  She's good with anything.  Yeah.  Anywhere, apparently.  Oh, boy, yeah.  All right.  Let's look. 
[01:46:00]  She's not bad.  She's really not that bad.  Is she going to take one in the, um...  In the yap?  She's, uh...  She's got a bit of skank to her.  Stop talking.  Stop trying to talk.  Oh, hey, there's, uh...  Wow, look at that.  Look at the condoms.  Um...  Knock it off with those.  I know.  It looks like two people trying to walk into the same revolving door.  Yeah.  This way, this way, this way, this way, this way.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  Why is she eating tapioca pudding?  It's all over her face.  I don't know. 
[01:46:30]  Why is she trying to have a serious conversation?  She's just deaf.  What does that have to do with her splashing, uh, food products all over her face?  All right, well...  Get it.  Wow.  I wish I could give out the website.  That website's hilarious.  You see that one at the bottom?  Oh, what just flew into her face from the side there?  Well...  That was nice.  What is it?  Did someone spit on her?  Or was that a little loud?  Someone spit on her face?  Yeah.  Why is it necessary?  Well, you just have to, you know.  Oh, that's funny. 
[01:47:00]  What are you, a Mormon?  It's not...  Yeah, what's the matter?  What's wrong with your feelings?  Mouth spitting is okay, but...  She didn't hear it coming, which is good.  Of course she does.  You never hear the shot that hits you.  Yeah.  There's just no need, because she's talking, and all of a sudden she's, like, taken back,  and she knows, well, I can't react, because it's a video.  I have to pretend I like it.  Just in case she...  So that's the degrading part?  Not the ten gallons she had all over her?  No, because that's part of the sex act.  That's okay.  Oh, oh.  The spitting is afterwards.  The guy, she's leaving.  She's all showered.  Here, take this.  It's a snot rocket in her ear.  Just no reason for that. 
[01:47:30]  So Ian from Connecticut, he wins.  And what does he win?  Some Family Guy thing, where they're not going to be wearing the costumes?  And they're just going to be on stools.  Yeah.  You get to see the guys from Family Guy on stools, live at Carnegie Hall.  Terrific.  Good for you.  Love Family Guy.  Not sure if I would love seeing it with Seth just hanging out on a stool.  I'm in that fashion.  All right.  He wins earbuds.  Huh?  He wins earbuds.  Those dumb sounds being piped in. 
[01:48:00]  Let's go to the F.U. line and see what's going on today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have seven new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big F.U. to all the CEOs and CFOs who are actually C.J.Os.  who are going to be bailed out with this $700 billion proposal.  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big F.U. to the dumb F.U. that just ran into me. 
[01:48:30]  She didn't even apologize, ran in her house, and made her grandmother come out and apologize for her.  You dumb B.U.  You ruined my morning, my week, and my new car.  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big F.U. to my F.U.  Foreman F.U.  Thanks for calling me for overtime, you f***ing f***g.  Next message.  And I just want to give a big F.U. to the fat lady that I just brought in the faucet in my cab.  $55 friggin' F.U.  And she can't give me a dollar tip. 
[01:49:00]  F*** you, you fat.  See you next Tuesday.  Next message.  Hi, I'd like to leave a big F.U. to the United States Congress.  You bastards are taking my tax dollars and giving it to a buck of lazy CEOs and corporations  that can't manage their own damn company.  Next message.

So when I went to work on Friday, my boss thinks that I'm a f***ing victim of domestic violence.  F*** you, you s***.  Next time I'm going to punch you right in the f***ing horse's teeth, you guys.  End of new messages.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1. 
[01:50:00]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  O.P. and Anthony, Jim Norton, Down and Dirty, available on demand on HBO.  The second episode was wonderful, Jimmy.  Yeah, people really liked that one, so I think the next one is either Bill Burzad or Patrice,  one of those two guys who's a headliner.  I'm a huge fan of Jim Jeffries, and he did great for you.  We've got to get him back on the show, but he's traveling the world with his comedy. 
[01:50:30]  I'm going to plug my L.A. dates, because no one's going to come see me in L.A.  It's depressing.  Of course they will, Jimmy.  Friday and Saturday, December 12th, 13th, I'm in the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood.  Very good.  Taking it to L.A.  ViperRoom.com.  Yeah.  Look at you.  I've never done headline shows there, and I'm sure this will be the last one.  Love your confidence, Jimmy.  Accuracy.  Even when everything is going well, he still has no confidence.  Believe me.  You're on HBO.  I'm sitting there going, I'm watching Jimmy on HBO.  This is huge. 
[01:51:00]  And you're probably going to get more episodes, knock on wood.  I hope.  But it's like, I'm very realistic, dude.  I'm very realistic.  That way you'd be surprised and not pleasantly surprised and not disappointed.  You're not realistic.  Eventually you're going to be right, because everyone's career, you know, it has a lifespan.  You should live in the moment.  Things are going great for you, Jimmy.  You've got a book coming out soon.  I do.  Oh, I got the cover, by the way.  Do you?  Somebody at FH Riley.  I forgot his name.  He's always there.  He's a great guy.  He works for Otto and George. 
[01:51:30]  And he works for the company that's doing your book cover, I think.  Oh, okay.  He gave me the poster.  I got it.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  A poster or just a cover?  It's a poster of the covers.  I haven't even seen that.  It looks great.  I knew I forgot something today.  Here's the thing.  I have to sell a total of 400 tickets.  When you're really famous and you say, look, I'm going to be in this room, the first day  their tickets are gone.  That's the way it works.  Yeah.  That's what you want.  Yeah.  Jimmy, stop.  That's true.  You sold out two shows in Boston in no time whatsoever. 
[01:52:00]  Let's all chip in and buy them all.  Let's all just chip in.  You're starting to get the big following out west.  Boston is our place, though.  Boston for us is great.  So you'll always have a reason why it's going.  You should just know.  You're living the moment.  I am.  I'm accurate.  You've got a book coming out.  You've got an HBO series.  I do.  You sold out some pretty big shows recently.  I want to be able to go on sale in L.A. and not sell 2,000 tickets. 
[01:52:30]  Not sell 5,000 tickets.  10,000.  400 tickets.  Oh, I'm just going to go up higher.  It's not unreal.  No, no, no.  That'd be too many.  The Rose Bowl.  I'm doing the Rose Bowl, New Year's Eve, be there at Beast Square.  Jimmy, then that's going to happen.  Then you're going to be like, but now why can't I do this?  And then you're going to do that.  And then it's like, but why am I not in movies?  Then you're going to be in hit movies.  And I'm like, yeah, but I still haven't sold out Mars yet.  But in that obsession to do more, it's perpetual motion. 
[01:53:00]  You should also enjoy it.  Who said I don't enjoy it?  I love my life.  All right, good.  That's what I want to hear.  I'm never happy.  I do enjoy it, but I'm accurate.  You could have just ended it there.  I'm never happy.  I am, though.  But I do enjoy things.  But I don't hear laughs, though.  I'm so bizarre.  Like when I was doing a letter recently.  When your schwance is in your hand.  Well, then I'm just content.  I'm happy.  I'm sad.  I'm angry.  I'm nervous.  I'm everything.  You were great on Leno.  Handler, you forced me to watch that. 
[01:53:30]  And you were great on that.  And Carson Daly, you killed.  Things are going good.  When I was doing Leno, I was convinced I was not doing well.  I was like, this sucks.  Oh, my God.  Where does that come from?  It's completely real.  Dude, you killed.  I never think I'm doing well.  I really, honest to God, after this Delano segment ended, I almost apologized to Jay.  But I'm telling you, in that moment, there are guys that hear things with laugh ears,  where everything you hear, they think people are laughing at.  So they never get an accurate.  They tell awful jokes constantly.  And think that they killed. 
[01:54:00]  Dude, you more than belong there.  And did great.  Bill Maher was trying to get the bigger laugh.  And he even turned and shut his big trap up.  Watching it in hindsight was cool.  But I'm just telling you, in the moment, that's how I react.  Huh.  I mean, I always have.  I don't...  You were wonderful.  Thank you.  Things are going well for you.  They are.  Dude, I'm not complaining.  But I mean, I'm just...  I'm very, very realistic.  I know where I'm very strong.  And I know where I would like to be stronger.  All right.  You know.  There are guys that will go on sale.  And I'm not talking about Dane Cook. 
[01:54:30]  But you get some guys that go on sale.  And they sell pretty evenly all over.  I want to sell evenly all over.  You're heading toward that.  Quicker than you think.  I mean, the HBO show is certainly going to help that.  Yeah.  It just helps with name recognition.  It's definitely good.  You're heading toward that.  It's very obvious.  So you'll do good.  You'll do well at the Viper Room.  And then, you know.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  We did the sports.  We kind of looked at the movies.  Is there a movie out there that is worth seeing?  That anyone wants to see. 
[01:55:00]  I wanted to see a movie this weekend.  And you look at the stupid...  What is it called?  Outside the movie theater.  And it's like, I don't want to see any of this.  Is there one movie people are saying you've got to go see?  What about the Halloween movie?  The quarantine one.  Quarantine?  Finished second.  Oh, I don't know.  What's that about?  It's a low budget, scary movie.  It looks a little creepy.  It's one of those, you know, kind of scary movies.  But, meh.  You know, also, I watched so much crap yesterday.  I watched, what was that one called? 
[01:55:30]  Unaccompanied Minors.  What?  That's the one with Louis Black is in it.  Uncle Paul.  Louis Black is in it.  He plays the airport security guy chasing these kids around the airport.  Was it really bad?  Was it so bad that Louis Black would even say, yeah, it was bad?  I love when some of these guys come in.  Louis probably got a nice little check for it.  So, God bless him.  Good for him.  You know, he's good at what he does. 
[01:56:00]  Yep.  And, I don't know, the dark-haired girl was pretty cute.  Was she like 18?  I don't even remember this one.  Did you see it, Danny?  Because you were just, well, whoop, whoop, whoop.  No, I just remember the trailer for the movie came out.  And there was some awful, terrible song that went along with it.  And, like, I couldn't even get through the commercial on the TV spot.  I had to turn it off because I did not want to see the rest of it.  It was terrible.  It was really bad.  I saw a couple minutes of it.  I saw Louis' face.  And I love Louis, but I don't like kids.  I just couldn't.  It's Louis chasing kids around. 
[01:56:30]  When it's a kid's movie like that, though, it's not that bad.  Yeah, that's kind of what I thought.  It's like I'm watching it thinking, like, you know, I'm not the one that this is really  aimed at or anything.  I haven't seen a girlfriend while I was scrapping for it during it.  Can I say that with love and respect?  Please.  I'm with you.  Quiet, honey.  I'll take it.  I'm right behind you.  I haven't seen a good movie in a long time. 
[01:57:00]  I mean, I finally saw Iron Man.  I didn't see it when it was in theaters.  That was the last movie I saw.  It's better than Batman.  And Batman I loved.  I can't tell you the last time I was in a movie theater seeing a movie.  That wasn't like, and I think it was once I went to a screening that we had for something.  Oh, it was that stupid basketball movie.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You fell asleep.  Yeah.  And you should have.  Yeah, it was.  Semi-pro.  Semi-pro.  And then we came on the air.  It's after the show.  I'm exhausted.  We came on the air and made believe it was a good movie.  Yeah, and it really sucked.  Because we thought we were going to have Will Ferrell in studio.  We didn't. 
[01:57:30]  And then we didn't, so now.  And we said it sucked.  Yeah.  But that was the last time I was in a movie theater, and it wasn't even like going to  the movies.  It was one of those things we kind of had to do.  So I haven't just gone to the movies.  I can't even tell you when.  There's no reason for it.  I like going sometimes, man.  If there's not a crowded theater, I like going.  I have no, there's nothing there at the theater that I want that I can't get watching something  at home.  Or, like, I don't care about the experience.  I don't want to sit there with people I don't know, listen to their stupid jibber jabber, 
[01:58:00]  listen to them talking.  You know what annoyed, I get so annoyed, really annoyed, at the talking before the  movie even starts.  Like, just because I don't like their inane conversations.  Just the, ugh.  Or then when a trailer plays, and it stinks.  It sucks.  And you hear someone go, oh, God, it looks so funny.  I want to see that.  And they really mean, you want to turn around and go, are you serious?  Do you live in the same world I do?  Yeah, that sucked. 
[01:58:30]  You want to smack them in the head.  Danny, yes?  That annoyed me so much.  I went to see, I forget what movie I went to go see, but they were playing trailers  for that, uh, that, uh, Zohan.  Let me guess, Barfly?  They played the hell out of it on the TV spot where, uh, he's in a fight with somebody  and then, like, the foot comes up out of nowhere and he's like, uh, take it, take it, now smell  it.  Yeah.  And, like, that's supposed to be funny.  And these, a group of, like, four or five kids behind me, and, like, they weren't even  kid kids, like, they were adult people and they were laughing. 
[01:59:00]  And for the next four trailers that were playing that I was just trying to watch, this kid  behind me just kept going, take it, take it, now smell it, and kind of laughing to himself.  And I'm like, who in the hell thinks that's funny?  Who's finding that funny?  It's terrible.  It's everything annoys me, like that, when they laugh at bad movie trailers, and then  the, uh, the, like, talking, someone explaining the movie to somebody next to him, that was,  oh, what was that?  What just happened?  Oh, the guy, see, he was originally the...  Shut up! 
[01:59:30]  What about when they're explaining it because they brought their 10-year-old kid to go see,  like, the, you know, some movie with a complex plot, like Memento?  You know, you're trying to enjoy the movie, and he's just like, I don't understand.  What do you mean the movie's going backwards?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  And who are you?  Where are my parents?  I don't want any more popcorn.  Yes.  It tastes funny.  I don't like it.  There's a snake in the popcorn box.  Why did you take me to see this movie?  There's naked people in it. 
[02:00:00]  Who are you?  Why is everyone wearing trench coats?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Why is everybody shooting squirt guns full of tapioca pudding?  That's weird.  But when there's, when there's, I told you mine, I hate the neediness of human beings  with the eating of everything before the movie starts, and why can't we, like...  Rustling.  There's always rustling.  Why can't we, one dumb entrepreneur, come up with, like, candy that doesn't make noise 
[02:00:30]  as you're opening it up, as the movie's starting, and it's really important that the movie starts  nice and quiet in the air.  Yeah, it ruins the whole mood.  Like, there's a mood of a movie sometimes.  It's got to be quiet.  You don't need plastic over the box of candy.  It's obvious.  I got to admit, though, I am a little guilty of ruining that special mood, though.  Like, if there is a very dramatic and quiet scene, and I still have popcorn left, I will  crunch it very slowly and loudly.  That's funny, though. 
[02:01:00]  You suck.  But you're doing it on purpose.  Yeah, of course.  These people, the neediness of humans, and I've said it, it sounds like locusts going  through a field.  Everybody just chomping on their candy and their popcorn.  I try to make it sound like I'm eating an apple.  When something very...  Crunch.  That never bothers me.  Talking?  Talking.  I want to murder people for it.  Bugs the crap out of it.  And I don't even mean during the movie.  That's something that's so beyond, you shouldn't do that.  Like, there are things that shouldn't annoy people, that annoy me, in particular, in movies.  When there's subtitles, sometimes, you know, you got the bad Russian guy or something, and 
[02:01:30]  subtitles, if someone reads it out loud, I want to punch them in the face.  And I don't even mean them reading it to somebody.  They just feel compelled to read it out loud.  I want to punch them.  Yeah.  I hate the movie theater experience.  I don't know if I told this on the air, but I went to one of these artsy theaters, and  I had, like, the Raisinettes, and because it's my pet peeve, the noise and stuff, that  I was trying to open up my candy, and I would... 
[02:02:00]  Maybe you could...  I don't have any sound effects over here, like, just...  Oh, what the...  But I was trying to go...  Yeah, I was trying to get it like this.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I would stop, because I'm like, all right, I'm making too much noise.  All right, I'll try again.  All right, I'll stop.  I'll stop, right?  Paranoid that I'm wrecking it for other people.  Yeah, as high school kids are answering their cell phones.  No, no, well, it's an artsy theater, so people are really into the experience.  So it got to the point where I just couldn't get the job done.  Did I ever tell you this?  An old lady that was sitting next to me ripped the candy out of my hand and opened it for 
[02:02:30]  me and handed it back.  Good for her.  And I had a laugh.  I'm like, you know, I looked at her and laughed like, bravo.  That's exactly what you should have done.  Because I was trying to be dainty about it, but I was still annoying everyone, even though  I'm trying not to.  Ten times longer than it would have taken to just open the goddamn thing.  So she just grabs it and goes, and hands it back and goes, here.  Enough.  It would be so great if you just knocked her teeth out and then accused her of thievery  and had her arrested. 
[02:03:00]  She stole my candy.  Let's go to Todd in Detroit.  Todd?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Todd.  If you guys are that bothered about going to the movies, you know, I mean, actually  having, you know, human contact with people, go back to your mansions and stay home.  That's what I do, Todd.  Yeah, that's what you should do, Anthony.  It is, and that's what I was saying, because when I went to the movies, it was always a pain  in the ass.  Shut your face.  You with peasants like you in there.  You're a peasant.  You shouldn't be in the same theater with royalties such as me. 
[02:03:30]  I rule, you drool.  Bye, Todd.  All right, Todd.  Very good.  I wonder if it's cold in the D.  I believe it is at this point.  Brian St. Louis, Opie, quarantine sucked more than having a dead guy in your fire pit.  Oh.  You know what, though?  That movie was, it wasn't, like, released to critics or anything, but it was actually  doing, like, okay for a horror movie on Rotten Tomatoes. 
[02:04:00]  I think it was getting, like, 60-something percent.  Really?  Danny's kind of a horror movie connoisseur.  I love it.  And you kind of dissed it when I said, I go, ooh, that looked scary.  Well, because typically, I mean, as has been the case for quite some time, they always  put the scariest and most creepiest parts of the horror flick in the trailer.  So, you know, it does look like a creepy movie, but I'm sure if I went to see it and tried  to sit through it, you know.  And then one creepy part comes up that you saw in the trailer already.  We're not going to get anything done.  Eric in Boston, quarantine.  It sucked.  Jim, quarantine was good.  All right.  There you go.  That's why it's what it's rated. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Why are we...  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston listening on BBC and Jared.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, man.  I imagine that movie, Unaccompanied Minors, is about a weekend at Anthony's house.  Oh, hey.  There it is.  Yeah, that's it.  There it is.  It's the fact that Anthony likes a younger gal, and he's open about it.  Why wouldn't I be?  I'm being what is called honest.  I don't know of any...  I've seen girls walking around, very attractive, and I say to myself, I go, there is not one 
[02:05:00]  guy who wouldn't find her attractive.  I go, some phony croc would go, no, I don't like that.  Ew, all that nice, smooth skin.  Ooh, I like a nice dumper with a bunch of cellulite on it, and ugh.  No.  Yeah, that's what I like.  Wrinkles.  Give me wrinkles. 
[02:05:30]  I want one...  I want two wrinkles.  One in the front, one in the back.  A small one in the front, big one in the back.  Of the stinker, right?  Of the stink wrinkle.  Jesus.  What are we...  We're like nine years old.  Oh, goddamn children.  I was trying to...  Uncle Paul.  Let's go to the janitor.  The janitor.  Hey, what's up, guys?  On 23rd Street here in Manhattan, between 6th and 7th Avenue, they have a handicap, impaired, 
[02:06:00]  and special people's housing.  So every time you go see a movie on 23rd Street at Clearview Cinemas, there's always going to  be a class of special handy people, so I saw Tropic Thunder, and when Simple Jack came  out, they picked up the class and exported them out of the movie theater because they  were offended.  Oh, come on.  There's no way.  That would take way too much time.  The caretakers stood up, they took about 10 of the handicapped people, and they just  walked right out of the theater. 
[02:06:30]  It's really good.  You bring retarded people to a comedy, let them see anything else made fun of except  themselves.  That's healthy.  Out, you dumbbells.  All we should have done was just burn the theater down, and then the last man out that could  get out, just...  And that's that.  Oh, God.  All right.  Hey, the church thing before we get out of here.  Yes.  Church sponsors anti-pornography weekend.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  It was a church event billed as Porn and Pastries.  Porn and Pastries.  They should have just called it Porn and Pastries.  Pastries.  Pastries.  And some 300 women, mostly in their 20s and 30s, paid $10 each to attend, my friends.  What?  Oh, no.  I heard you.  I just meant like, what?  I'll repeat that.  20 and 30-year-olds?  You would think maybe 40 and 50-year-olds, maybe? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  The young are...  Sticks in the mud.  They were here in many cases because of what happens when a woman finds out her spouse  or boyfriend has been secretly spending a lot of time looking at porn on the internet.  Oh, okay.  Often while espousing Christian values.  See, I had to do some marriage classes recently because I'm going to do the right thing and  get married in a church even though I don't go to church and I don't believe in organized  religion.  Is there family religious?  Yeah, they are.  And, you know, it was a wish. 
[02:08:00]  I'm like, fine.  And I had to sit in these classes in front of these asses and they would talk about this  stuff saying porn is bad, lust is bad.  It's like, what age do you live in?  Yeah, what is that about?  Like, so you go to the class and they teach you, like, how to be married?  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  Well, they depress the crap out of you.  They throw a lot of guilt at you.  It's supposed to be a happy time that you're getting married and instead you get these guys 
[02:08:30]  in front of these classes, borderline homosexuals.  You're like, why are you even married?  It's obvious you've got some issues that you probably should have figured out.  Yeah.  And the one thing that drove me.  They're not priests then?  No, they just kind of work for the church.  Oh, they're like civvy.  Let it be known.  My girl was beyond cool with this whole thing.  She was like in agreement with some of the stuff I was saying.  But one of the things they said was that lust is bad.  And if you lust, that's really not good. 
[02:09:00]  And you really need to figure that out.  No.  You should never lust after your spouse.  That's silly.  And I was going to raise my hand, but then I was going to be the guy that made everyone  stay late.  Yeah, you don't want to be that guy.  No, because the whole room was people going, just looking at their watches because it's  something they have to do.  They're not really getting anything.  I swear I used to think those were one-on-one things.  Hell no, man.  Where you'd have the couple and then one guy and you'd sit in like an office and they would  tell you something like a shrinker.  It was in a huge room.  Yeah.  There had to be close to 60, 70 couples. 
[02:09:30]  Everyone's looking at their watches.  So I didn't want to be that guy, but I was losing my mind.  And you all swap.  Start banging each other's perspective wives.  Dude, four two-hour classes.  Two of the guys were cool.  Like, look, I don't have much to tell you guys.  Here's an hour, hour 15.  Get out of here.  The last guy had to get right to nine o'clock because he has no life outside the church.  And he had to like, you know, this was his thing to prove his existence on this planet.  That he was going to take us right to nine with these little life lessons. 
[02:10:00]  And he was the lust guy.  Pre-Kena.  And I'm yelling at my chick.  I'm like, this is why people cheat.  Because they don't have lust in their lives.  That's why they cheat.  You should absolutely lust after who you're with.  Of course you should.  That's crazy not to lust after who you're with.  Look, making love with someone is absolutely awesome.  I've heard.  But also lusting after someone is just as awesome.  Just getting one of those, you know, I'm an animal. 
[02:10:30]  Can't you do both at the same time?  I think so.  Yes.  Yes.  Maybe not.  Of course it is.  I think.  And for the church to say that lust is bad and they wonder why their numbers are way down.  They just don't live in reality.  They just don't live in reality.  It drove me nuts.  If you watch porn, you better take care of that before you get married.  I'm like, shut the F up.  Everyone looks at porn.  Everyone.  How about getting your wife in there and tell her, look, this is what I'm going to need. 
[02:11:00]  Go to scenes one, four, and seven.  You can do that.  Not here.  If not, there's going to be problems.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Hey, Stryker.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  When my wife and I went through our pre-marriage classes, I got kicked out of the class because  I started questioning the church's values.  And I asked the priest.  Heresy.  Heresy.  Burn him.  You should treat it like that.  I asked the priest when the Catholic Church was going to come into the 20th century on 
[02:11:30]  their stance on porn, marriage, and abortion, and I was asked to leave.  Yeah.  Well, you brought up a big three, the trifecta.  Yeah.  Thank you, Stryker.  We walked all the way home, and it's on the east side.  We live on the other side of the park, and also it's a long walk.  The whole time, my girl had to calm me down.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  I was just reminded why I don't go to church anymore.  Because there's parts of me, because I was brought up very religious and stuff, and did 
[02:12:00]  everything you were supposed to do, and did a little extracurricular church stuff.  Uh-oh.  Religion class.  Not that guy.  Is this the stuff you've blocked out?  Not that guy.  Uh-oh.  I was never the kept-after-class kid.  No, no.  It was religion class.  When he was young, how do you not keep him after class?  I know.  A little tussle of the hair.  My blonde, innocent, blue eyes.  Oh, jeez.  Surprise.  It's almost not gay if you did that.  It was religion classes at married people's houses, where you could see their household 
[02:12:30]  is in disarray, and everyone's depressed, filled with guilt, and all that stuff.  And then, because of these marriage classes, I'm like, oh, that's right.  This is why I don't go to church.  I forgot.  Just in case I was starting to think, maybe this is for me.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  That's right.  I don't agree with half the crap they're trying to tell you.  I only went when my parents were together, first of all.  Right.  That was a while ago.  And because, you know, that was what they had to do.  You know, oh, you're Catholic.  You have a kid.  You raise him Catholic.  So you go through all that schmear. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  And stuff.  But the second they split up, it was like, oh, my mother didn't have time to take me  to church.  And I didn't care.  It wasn't like, I want to go to church.  I want to do this.  And the only other times I've been in church have been for weddings or funerals.  And the guy gets up there and starts talking.  I couldn't tell you what he's saying, what he's talking about.  I just know they read that goddamn letter.  Someone reads that letter from the Corinthians.  And there's damn Corinthians.  And you know, you know, it's almost over.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it's almost over.  All right.  And there's a lot of standing, sitting and kneeling. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  And then you leave and shake hands at everybody and go drink.  A handshake, you know, to spread the germs.  And then you fight for your way out of the parking lot.  Yeah.  And there's no, there's no, I don't listen intently on what he's saying.  And it's like, marriage is a holy, sacred bind between two.  Who cares?  How about this?  It's, you know, you're living in sin if you're living with your chick before you get married.  Right.  Oh, that was wonderful when they came up with that rule when we were all like little, you know, peasants living in the same village.  But in this day and age, you know, you got the long distance relationships and stuff. 
[02:14:00]  And the economy, what?  We're supposed to pay for two places in New York City.  Go F yourself.  Save it.  Wake the F up.  Save it for marriage.  You're not supposed to live together.  Well, guess what?  Why don't you tell, you know, the government and the economy that it's not feasible, these rules.  That's the problem.  And then they went into the whole birth control.  No birth control. 
[02:14:30]  They just suck.  Just pump out more Catholics.  Well, and the only reason is because they want as many Catholics walking this earth as possible.  It has nothing to do with, it's just getting the numbers up.  That's all that is.  They try to romanticize and stuff and say crap.  But the reality is they want a lot of Catholics.  So they say use the rhythm method?  Yep.  And there's websites.  And there's some literature up here in the front, you know, to learn more.  I'm like, if you pick up any of that literature, the wedding's off. 
[02:15:00]  God, they just, they really annoy me.  Dude, I was out.  I bit.  The scars are gone.  I was biting myself.  Not scars, but the marks.  I was biting myself because I wanted to, I wanted to punch him.  I can see that.  I want to punch this guy.  They're always going to be against abortion.  I get that.  Fine.  They're the church.  They're supposed to be against abortion.  Yeah.  And even porn.  They have to be against porn.  But birth control in a marriage, you idiots.  Yeah.  You irrelevant idiots.  What if you're being responsible in that you can't afford to have a child? 
[02:15:30]  Of course.  Stuff like that.  They would rather you just have the kid and then have it raised in some crappy environment?  Well, my mom tells a story.  She was turned off by the church a long time ago.  She did the Catholic schools with the nuns beating the crap out of her.  All those stories are true.  Yeah.  Everyone's mom has that story.  But they're all true.  Like the older generation, the nuns used to beat the crap out of them.  They would say stuff like, if you're thinking about sex right now, you're going to hell.  What's the first thing you think of when someone says that? 
[02:16:00]  Sex.  You're thinking of something pink.  Grape food.  My mom was the good Catholic girl.  She had six kids in like seven years.  Too many crickets.  And then everyone knows that I listen to the show.  We were pretty poor growing up.  And now she's like, holy crap, I got six kids because the church told me.  And then I got another one from another marriage and her friends.  And I'm basically supporting nine kids in my house or whatever year it is. 
[02:16:30]  Goes to the church for some help.  And then you go, I don't know what to tell you.  Sorry.  Well, but you were the one who encouraged us to have as many kids because the thing with  the that, the that, the that.  And then you go to the church with a real problem.  Like, guess what?  You know, we're going to lose our house.  And, you know, what can you do for me?  Pray.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Pray.  Exactly.  They'll take care of you if you pray.  Yeah, when you dump, pray that that doesn't happen.  Yeah.  Pray that she doesn't get pregnant. 
[02:17:00]  So moving back to porn and pastries was part of an anti-porn weekend.  At the church, that included porn and pancakes for guys and porn and parents on Saturday and  a porn Sunday today.  Now, apparently this isn't like porn and pancakes.  Like, you get to see porn and then eat some pancakes.  I'm thinking, you know, you get yelled at about the porn.  Showing, by the way, showing that the church is completely clueless.  Yeah.  Porn and pancakes.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  How many of us have made their own pancakes?  Yeah.  You know, I got the batter.  Well, you take a stack of them and you kind of drill a hole in the pancakes.  You climb on the table and watch some porn.  That's what that is.  Porn and...  We've all made a few pancakes on a few body parts over there.  Potato flakes.  Hey, take the potato flakes.  Well, the group, they have a website.  It's called xxxchurch.com.  Wow.  And they do this thing.  Something with a triple X in front of it? 
[02:18:00]  Porn and pastries was the first woman-only event that the XXX Church has done as it stages  more than 100 anti-porn gatherings a year.  Among those attending Friday's event was a 31-year-old Seattle woman whose husband told  her a year ago, after five years of marriage, that he was looking at porn.  Mm-hmm.  Honey, sit down.  I got something to tell you.  I was going to tell you.  I'm so upset.  I'm looking at porn.  Oh, God.  Let's pray to Jesus right now.  We have to pray.  We have to pray that I can get over this. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  Hold it.  My picture's downloaded.  All right.  I was just waiting for a video to download.  Oh, my God.  You got to be kidding me.  Porn rules.  Porn does rule.  There's nothing wrong with looking at nudity, and it's fantastic.  And it gives you broad something to strive for.  Right.  A goal.  This is what I like.  This is what I like.  So get one of your darker gentleman friends and bring him over, and I'll cower in the corner. 
[02:19:00]  You humiliate.  I'll prepare him.  I don't want to prep the ball.  I just want to watch.  I don't prep the ball.  The next paragraph will anger some people and infuriate.  What is it?  The Obama-McCain numbers?  Presumably, her husband is a Seattle couple.  Could have used the delete browsing history tool on his computer.  Although she said a woman just has a sense that the man in her life is spending time on those websites. 
[02:19:30]  The husband decided it was the Christian thing to do to tell his wife.  Well, isn't that sweet?  He was probably hoping the uptight bitch would want to watch some and learn a thing or something.  Yeah.  Let me leave this here.  Hopefully, she'll come up to me and go, I didn't know you were into that.  Why don't we watch a little of this?  But no.  We'll pray together.  Praise.  You don't watch it anymore.  Is there anything in the Bible about porn?  Probably. 
[02:20:00]  And it could twist around any little, whatever they call them.  I was going to say phrase or sentence or passage.  Some passage.  And make it sound like, you know, you're not supposed to turn your computer on.  Yeah.  And then grab your mouse.  Click on a website.  Porn is covered by a letter from Marv to the Corinthians.  Marv.  Ted to the Corinthians.  Pornography is wrong, saith the Lord.  Dear Corinthians.  High Corinthians is Ted again. 
[02:20:30]  I'm going to read a small note.  Perhaps we'll rhyme and become a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue.  Don't watch porn.  Oh, I guess it's not a poem.  Let's go to Houston.  Bobby.  Morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Good evening.  Yeah.  I just wanted to tell y'all, since y'all brought it up, that Triple X Church, our preacher went  as far as to tell my wife, Triple X Church actually makes a program, whenever you go on 
[02:21:00]  a porn website, it will email your wife that you went to that porn website.  Oh, that's a good one.  It will even email your wife if you try to turn it off.  Email box is full.  Just like one hour.  Box is full.  I'd go to different ones just to annoy my wife, like black gentlemen together or uncut  Ricans.  Oh, yeah.  Chicks with, you know.  Were you going to uncut Ricans?  Yeah.  Yes, we'll pray together. 
[02:21:30]  If she's going to be a nosy buddy, yeah, you'd really go over the top with it.  Did you go to my wife's at pig.com again?  I certainly did.  Wow, that is a nasty little program, huh?  She gets emails where you're like trying to, you know, try to get her involved in threesomes  on these swinger websites.  Well, you go to, talking about how awful your wife is, but you're still willing to offer  her up to the bull.  Or you go to killmywifeformoney.com.  Right.  Just really effed with her.  Oh, that's awesome. 
[02:22:00]  Let's say hi to Holly in Delaware.  Holly.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I just had my first meeting.  I'm engaged.  I'm getting married next year.  And the reason for sex is they want you to procreate.  The only reason they want you to have sex, want you to get married, is to have children.  Not to feel good.  And what is the reason for that?  Because they want as many Catholics as possible.  Right. 
[02:22:30]  That's all?  They even consider the rhythm method as birth control.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they do.  They frown upon the rhythm method also.  Yeah.  They do?  Because they suck.  I know.  So you're just supposed to just have sex.  Well, every time you're having sex, it's because you're trying to have a kid.  Screw the lost and all that.  It's mechanic.  So it would be like, so you can use an excuse and just kind of, you know,  kind of just in the middle of doing it, right? 
[02:23:00]  Right when you're at that precipice.  You go, oh, I got a cramp.  So you had to kind of, you know.  I got you.  You can't talk openly.  You pull your dick out.  Very good.  So getting back to the story, the husband decides it was the Christian thing to do to tell his wife.  Ew. 
[02:23:30]  That's how it's spelled.  Ew.  Gross was her reaction.  The woman said, us women, we don't understand it, although I'm not surprised.  I know many men look at porn, but that gives them unrealistic expectations.  What?  People in those movies are all done up, look great, and say yes to everything.  Pig.  Pig.  Yes.  That is spoken like a true pig.  Yes.  Or just a nudge in bed.  It's not a nudge.  And we've said on this show, I think we're all in agreement, the amateur stuff is way hotter than the bright lights and the makeup and all that crap. 
[02:24:00]  I don't like the made-up porn star crap.  I love the amateur stuff is where it's at.  Exactly.  She said she's talked with women, friends.  Yeah, that's ponies.  Doesn't know how to do it.  Always winds up hurting the guy.  He puts his back legs up on the top thing instead of his front legs.  And you're like, no, you're not doing this right.  Looks all silly.  Yeah, but your horse or dogs, they eat the oven mitts. 
[02:24:30]  They don't wear them.  Just trying to keep everyone safe.  She said she's talked with women, friends about men looking at porn.  So they get together and have a little tea and a little lunch.  And the women universally have the same reaction.  I don't think this would be universally, by the way.  It's universal.  Yeah, sure.  What's wrong with me?  Why does he have to look at something else?  Oh, stop it.  It's all about you.  What's wrong with me?  Me, me, me.  Sometimes it's not about you, you fatty. 
[02:25:00]  It's about...  It's just about guys like looking at naked broads.  And they like watching videos of them getting banged.  I also like watching videos of flaming idiots falling out of buses.  Yeah.  It's this video.  His legs are on fire.  Must be on Maury or something.  Of course it's on Maury.  Ah, good.  Someone from a faraway land gets hurt.  I laugh.  Yep.  Yep.  Faraway meaning what?  Delaware?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't care.  So, and you don't think the women are doing this yet? 
[02:25:30]  I'm going to sit here.  Let me do it, too.  I'm going to sit here and make believe that my girl doesn't look at porn or lust after  anybody else.  Stop.  Yes.  We're animals.  Yes.  We like that crap.  That's why she said their home computer now has software.  Oh, this is what this guy was saying.  Their monitor is its web history.  If a porn site is detected, a report is sent to the wife as well as to a friend who's helping  them out.  A friend, too?  Get the friend who goes over the house and eliminates it from your wife's computer. 
[02:26:00]  That's right.  There's no privacy when you're married, she said.  No privacy when you're married.  This bitch deserves to just be left.  That husband should just leave her destitute.  The women at Eastlake got to hear from Gross.  I guess Gross is the last name of somebody.  From Gross.  From a couple whose husband had had multiple affairs that he said were prompted by porn 
[02:26:30]  viewing.  Of course.  He's got to come up with an excuse.  Yeah, of course.  It was the porn.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I was driven to cheat by the poor.  No.  Ah.  Ruin it for everyone, you tool.  Horse crap.  Just say, you didn't like her fats.  Right.  Dench.  Dich.  Your relationship had issues to begin with.  Yes.  And then you come up with an excuse in the end.  And from a woman who said she had had 14 partners and four abortions and now had been celibate 
[02:27:00]  for two years.  So another woman attending the event was Heidi Green.  She's divorced and said that men she dates know fairly quickly that she doesn't believe  in sex without marriage.  Really?  Asked how many men decide they'll date someone else.  Green said probably 90%.  She's divorced?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That figures.  So there you go.  No sex before marriage.  And then you get there and go, oh, Christ, this chick sucks.  She's horrid. 
[02:27:30]  Got to go for the test drive, right?  Of course.  Don't just like say, I like that car.  Imagine that.  And then you're married and you go, oh, my God, here's our wedding night.  We're married.  She hops aboard and it's just awful.  Yeah.  It's horrid.  Is it really ever awful?  And then what do you do?  Yeah.  You know something?  I'm being honest.  Is it ever really awful?  Awful in what sense of the word?  It's based on a curve.  The curve is it's sex.  So it's better than, you know, working.  You know, it's better than doing something that is truly awful. 
[02:28:00]  You know what's awful?  But in its own, like, little, you know, bracket, it can be awful.  You know what's awful?  The reason you have sex, because I don't really think, like, sex is awful.  I think you want to make sure your smells are compatible.  Jesus.  What do you mean by that?  You mean you're not a, someone isn't offended?  Huh?  You mean that someone isn't offended by the other party involved? 
[02:28:30]  You've never been with, like, a woman and you're like, wow.  Thank God I knew I had a time.  It's the smells.  Yeah?  Yeah, they can be bad.  And that means you're not compatible.  Oh, okay.  Oh, is that how that works?  And then somebody else might find it wonderfully delicious?  There's someone for everyone out there.  Oh, okay.  But I think, you know, that's one reason why you should have the sex, to make sure your  smells are compatible.  I bet you that's nature.  I think you're right, actually. 
[02:29:00]  I think nature does that so you don't procreate with people whose DNA might be too close or  whatever.  I really think that's a nature thing.  Oh, that's good.  I have been with a couple of girls who are probably compatible with a trout then.  Well, that's sort of what I'm getting at.  But then it could also be, like, the body odor and everything else.  But, I mean, I've told the famous story.  My first girlfriend in college, she was beautiful.  My parents back then wished I'd married this girl.  She was, like, a wholesome girl from Utica.  And we were in love and young and all that.  I don't know what love was, to be honest with you. 
[02:29:30]  I guess I was for that age.  And then I told you the story driving home from Geneseo all the way to Long Island with  my hand out the window.  Oh, yeah.  You were waving goodbye.  Yeah, bye-bye the whole way.  For 350 miles.  Frostbite on its hands.  Yeah, I didn't have fingerprints left by the time I pulled into Huntington.  Oh, God.  And I was like, wow.  Wow.  This is awful.  A little pungent.  Dude, beyond.  Wow. 
[02:30:00]  That's something.  To the point where you're scrubbing.  I don't mind knowing I'm there, you know.  Huh?  I don't mind knowing I'm there.  You just don't want to, you know, you know you're there.  Yeah, sure.  I like to go.  It's like, you know, I remember driving back from California.  It was nice to know I was in Jersey.  Sure.  Because you're almost home.  Right.  I got you.  It's kind of nice when you're there.  You know when you're in that area, you know it's that area.  Well, yeah, it makes you happy that. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, you're like, ah, here I am.  All right.  I'm in Jersey, but I'm not going to live in Jersey.  But you don't want to punch in the face like, hey, you're here.  This is where you're going to have to stay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got you.  It was horrendous, man.  This thing was horrendous.  Horrendous.  And I was too young to really understand.  Yeah.  Too young.  I was a pool crotch.  Dude, I was a late bloomer when it came to that stuff.  So I was starting to think, oh, my God.  This is what I'm going to have to do.  You almost turned gay. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, right?  It's like, ah, screw it.  I was starting to think, is this every woman?  This is what?  Then you turned her over and realized.  Oh, yeah.  Could be worse.  No, he turned her over and realized, oh, this is the way I'm supposed to do it.  Oh.  Oh, you know what?  The other thing, I would have, you know, no problem.  No problem.  I would have taken that option with this one.  This one was, this was bad.  That's a real, you know.  This was some bad stuff. 
[02:31:30]  Real men happy with the entire undercarriage.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  So glad that, you know.  I don't care.  Frigging, from the oil pan to the exhaust pipe, I don't care.  I will.  I'll do a complete, like, you go to the car wash,  and you get that undercarriage cleaning.  Yeah.  I'll do a complete undercarriage.  I don't care.  We'd like to call it the car wash.  Yeah, sure.  Just get it all done.  I don't care.  All right.  Where's my, where's our music?  Oh.  That's our music.  My God, look at the time.  Oh, we went late. 
[02:32:00]  We did, so don't complain when we leave early.  That's right.  It's Columbus Day.  We want to go home.  What are you kidding?  People are like, yeah, I mean, wait, no, wait a minute.  This makes sense.  If you're lucky, we'll do another hour of radio today.  If you're lucky.  I just have to get across 5th before that stupid Columbus Day parade.  That's today's excuse for us?  That's today's excuse.  Columbus Day parade.  We love parades.  Yep.  In this town.  I love a parade.  That means we eat.  Yes, I love it.  As I'm making my turn onto the 59th Street Parade.  All right, guys. 
[02:32:30]  The phones, man.  We could have really done some time on this subject.  Yes.  That's just my thoughts on the whole thing.  To tell people that they shouldn't be lusting after their partner, that's just insane.  Well, I think we can probably continue a little of this.  Yeah, why don't we do that?  Over at SiriusXM.  Talk 30.  Talk like we want to talk.  Yeah.  After the break, we'll take more of your phone calls on this.  That's a good idea.  And for the people that are not joining us, have a great day.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Yep.  All right, here we are, continuing with the radio show. 
[02:33:00]  Very excited, man.  We've got a great guest that's going to be calling the show in a few minutes.  So psyched.  Yeah.  You know, thank you, Tim H. from Columbus.  He writes, nice song, Opie.  Did you steal it from a Nike commercial or something? 
[02:33:30]  Wink, wink.  Anyone else see the new Nike commercial using Ecstasy of Gold?  Really?  Oh, I did, actually.  Look, we admitted we stole it from Metallica.  Jimmy and I saw Metallica in Jersey.  That was the first time I saw them open up a show with the Ecstasy of Gold.  They show the video, though.  It's amazing.  Man, if you can't get pumped for the show after seeing that.  Holy shit.  And I think they start playing along backstage a little bit.  That's so great.  It's just amazing.  And we openly said that's where we got it from.  But now Nike's using it in their latest ad.  Oh, boy. 
[02:34:00]  How excited are you for our first guest, Jimmy?  Is he on now?  Hopefully.  Is that him?  All right.  Hold on a minute.  We're going to be talking to Daniel Marr.  Daniel Marr.  Now, what is this book about?  I just don't.  This is kind of crazy.  This is like, this is, this is, this is terrific.  I'm proud that we got him on today.  It's, uh... 
[02:34:30]  It's bro-cabulary.  Bro-cabulary.  Bro-cabulary, everyone.  Bro-cabulary.  The new manifesto.  Yes.  It says manifesto of dude talk.  Yes.  Oh, he can't hear us right now.  It's bro-cabulary.  Right.  So, uh, like, like I open this up and I see a bro-logue.  Oh, boy.  It's like the bro-logue is instead of a pro-logue.  Sure.  Called bro-logue.  Well, of course.  Other things like bro-munication.  Yep.  It's like communication, but, uh, the way, uh, guys do it.  Sure.  It's like a guys thing. 
[02:35:00]  Sure.  You know, how great is that?  Because we've all, uh, you know, we all love talking like this.  Yeah.  Guys.  It gets you the chicks.  A man-ic-dote.  Yeah, well.  Instead of an anecdote.  Yeah.  You know, things like that.  What about, and then you, and then we get into some of the vocabulary, like, uh, like  Harry Olis.  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[02:35:30]  We got.  No.  Let's get him on the phone, because it's bro-munication.  Brodal recall.  Well, we gotta, we gotta talk to, uh, Daniel Marr.  We're gonna learn about Mantees.  Look at this.  Hold on.  We're gonna learn about MC Hammered.  Dude, I gotta tell you this.  Roundhog.  What?  Brodal recall.  Yeah, well.  Is a bro's recall for what you did last night while hit-shammered.  Like hit-shammered.  This is, uh, I'm actually looking at the ten, the ten, the ten. 
[02:36:00]  The ten bro-man-mints.  Yeah.  The ten bro-man-mints.  Um, where, can we get them on the phone?  We are.  We're just setting it up.  Cock-a-doodle brew.  Cause I got.  Cock-a-doodle brew.  That's a beer that you, uh, drink first thing in the morning.  What are, what are, what are these, like, what are these called where you have, like,  the word and then the answer on the back?  What are they called?  Flashcards.  Like, kind of flashcards?  We're gonna learn about.  Community, chest, or chance.  Right.  We're gonna learn about, uh, manalyze.  Oh, when you manalyze something?  Uh, a guy brary. 
[02:36:30]  Uh.  Goddamn this stupid fucking.  Jersey girl.  Power talk audio.  Punxsutawney Jill.  We're gonna learn what that means in bro-cadular.  Oh, that's funny.  It's when a groundhog comes out of its hole and burns the other groundhog's shit.  Oh, a master date.  Oh, good gravy.  Oh, this is great.  And a PDA hole.  Good job.  Oh, God.  Let's talk to Daniel Maurer.  Yes.  Author of Brocabulary. 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  A new manifesto of dude talk.  That's right.  Daniel.  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good to be here.  We were going through your book, Brocabulary, the new manifesto of dude talk.  That's right.  And how did this come about there, Daniel?  Let's start with the basics.  What was the inspiration?  Well, the inspiration, actually, I was at what I would call a douche-dination.  What's that?  It was douchey, like bars and clubs.  And I was actually standing next to a shower girl, this girl that, you know, was she in the shower. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  That's how douchey it was.  And this guy called me a bromo.  I actually hadn't heard that one before.  A bromo?  What's a bromo?  It's a word for bros who are so tight, they're almost homo.  And I started trying it out on friends of mine, and people were, you know, kind of found it pretty hilarious.  So I realized there was something to this gynamic, you know, this phenomenon of bros, or what I would call gymese twins, who are constantly attached. 
[02:38:00]  Jesus.  Oh, gosh.  It's all the guy talking.  We were always, you know, drinking together and go everywhere together.  So, you know, I thought it would be cool to make up a kind of vocabulary for them that they could use when they're bro-ing down.  Right.  Bro- down.  What's a, when you're bro-ing down?  Well, when you're bro-ing it up, when you're with your bros and drinking and, you know, at the strip club, that sort of thing.  I think you got a hit on your hands here, Daniel.  Well, I couldn't get past the ten bro-manments.  It's like commandments for bros. 
[02:38:30]  Exactly.  Number one, I am your bro.  Thou shalt not put hoes before me.  Ah, bros before hoes has been something that's been said for a long time.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  I actually have a spin on that, though.  I mean, it is, obviously, that's kind of, you know, that's kind of unreasonable.  That's not going to happen in real life.  And it's okay to ditch for a bitch.  Ah.  As long as you have a gallaby.  And a gallaby is just...  A gallaby.  What's a gallaby?  Is that like, what is that? 
[02:39:00]  It's like an alibi for not, an explanation for why you weren't with your bros.  And it should never be romantic.  It should never be chivalrous.  You know, it shouldn't be about getting a girl flowers.  It should be about deflowering a girl.  Right.  That is a proper gallaby.  Nice.  And your bros should understand that.  You know, the bros before hoes can go out the window if you've got a good gallaby.  Exactly.  All right.  I'd just like to understand. 
[02:39:30]  But, yeah, you know, other, more from the Ten Bro Mamets, I mean, you should remember the Sabbath day, you know,  to keep it wholly devoted to watching football.  You know, you should honor your mother and father, obviously.  No mother jokes.  Why?  Mother jokes can be fun, no?  I don't know.  I think they're a little played out.  And that's kind of the idea, you know, behind the book, that these words are a little played out.  We need new words, you know. 
[02:40:00]  We've had the same kind of wingman terminology for a long time now, so it's time to kind of look to the future.  Well, speaking of men needing new words, let's go through some of your vocabulary here.  Sure thing.  Which ones would you like to do?  Well, how about you hit us up with a word?  You know, let's talk about the old words and the new ones.  I mean, we've had fugly for so long.  Why not come up with new ugly words, such as tugly, which is, you know, when a girl is so ugly, 
[02:40:30]  you'd rather just go home and tug it than hooking up with it.  Ah.  Oh, my God.  Or, you know.  I've got to tell you, Daniel, we've got a live audience today, and they're definitely enjoying this.  They're ugly.  Yeah, man.  You like Daniel so far?  Very good.  All right, tugly.  I like that.  Well, what about wasted?  I mean, you know, we've been using this word to describe a state of inebriation for so long.  You know, what about like...  We use it as time on this radio show.  What's that?  Now.  What's that?  I said sometimes we use it as, like, time on this radio show. 
[02:41:00]  It was wasted.  Oh, good gravy.  We use more specific words like slam decapped.  That's when you're so slammed that you can't even, like, get your car keys out of your pocket.  You need your bro to do it for you.  I heard that.  Oh, God.  Do you really want your bro going into your pockets, though?  Yes.  You know, with all your upper pockets.  You're back to bromo again.  Good gosh.  I've got to make a call.  All right.  When you're transvest tanked, you're so tanked that you don't care whether the hooker you just picked up is a man or a woman. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, transvest tanked.  Some people don't need to be drunk to do that.  Jimmy would be able to talk about that, but he's got business today.  He's a very busy man, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I wish, yeah, there was a word for that.  What is, I'm going through the bro-cabulary, Daniel.  What's this master date all about?  Master date, of course, is a date.  A date, but instead of taking a girl, you're taking yourself out of your pants.  It's kind of a masturbation session that's planned in advance.  Like, let's say your girl is going out on Friday night, and you know that you're going to have half an hour to yourself to kind of, you know, treat yourself to dinner and a movie. 
[02:42:00]  Dinner and a movie, of course, being a porno and some nachos.  Very good.  There's a whole actual chapter of Spankspeak, which I'm really proud of.  Oh, Spankspeak.  Oh, Spankspeak.  Well, where's that?  I want to play along here at home.  That's towards the end of the book, right?  And they're a shitter chatter.  Shitter chatter, sure.  And Spankspeak is actually, you know, like smasturbation, you know, when you're masturbating while smashed, which can often lead to a jack-out, which is when you black out while you're jacking off. 
[02:42:30]  A jack-out.  That's kind of funny.  Oh, my God.  That was jacking this weekend, weren't you?  Oh, my God.  I was so hammered.  I was, yeah, I passed out.  Right.  Dick in hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't mine.  Wait a minute.  You know, I'm confused with tear jerking.  Tear jerking is, you know, let's say you break up with a girlfriend, but you still have some holaroids of her lying around. 
[02:43:00]  Uh-huh.  What's a hol-deroid?  A holaroid is just a polaroid of a hoe that you went out with.  A holaroid.  Oh, all right.  I got you.  Oh, God.  I get that.  Yeah.  Some of these are kind of painful.  But, yeah, tear jerking is when you whip those out and you're kind of, you know, jerking it to what I would call mornography, which is pornography of, you know, a girl that you're still mourning the loss of. 
[02:43:30]  Ah.  It's a dark, dark place to be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, let's go to the phones and say hi to Steve.  Hi, Steve.  Hello.  You're on with Daniel.  Steve.  Hi, Daniel.  How are you?  Hey, Steve.  How's it going?  Is your book available in stores now?  I actually like the bro-munications and things of that nature.  Yeah, it is.  What exactly?  It's on Amazon.  Go ahead.  You talk.  I'll write it on the net.  What actually inspired you to do this? 
[02:44:00]  I think they asked that question, right?  I don't know.  I was listening.  I was on hold.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Steve.  We already asked them that question, Steve.  Yeah, for some reason, when our listeners are on hold, Daniel, they don't get to hear the show.  So maybe you could humor Steve and just tell them real fast.  Because, like, is this something, are these words that people are actually using?  Like, did you create a lot of them?  What happened?  Go.  Yeah, I did create most of them.  And the idea is to basically... 
[02:44:30]  What is your favorite one?  I like the holeroyd and the other one of the masturbation when the man passes out.  What is your favorite?  I like forensic evidence.  Ramone!  Tell this bag of shit to stop doing puns!  Ramone!  I'd rather give a bro job than listen to this shit stain.  That's pretty good.  Ramone!  I hope this man dies of AIDS. 
[02:45:00]  I wasn't expecting that.  Ramone!  He's ugly!  He's ugly and he sucks!  Ramone!  Ramone!  I read funnier leaflets at the DMV!  Tell me when you're done.  I'm just checking my email.  Okay.  All right.  I finished temporarily.  All right.  Let's thank you, Steve.  Yeah, sometimes these callers slip through. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  I like that, though.  Tell me when you're done.  I'm checking my email.  Yeah, wow.  Oh, wow.  Daniel?  Yeah.  Oh, the Punxsutawney Jill.  That was the one that piqued our interest when we were going through this.  Punxsutawney Jill is, you know...  What page is that on?  Hmm.  I'm trying to find it.  Wait a minute.  Do you know where that...  Oh, I got it.  Wow, what a coincidence.  I just turned right to it.  What page, Ant?  It's at 143.  143.  Okay. 
[02:46:00]  What's that one about?  That one is, you know, when spring comes around and, you know, a girl starts wearing a kind  of, you know, the first day of nice weather when she starts wearing a miniskirt and by  the end of the night, you know, she's shivering because the weather has changed.  She comes out like a groundhog, but...  Wow.  Did you do a lot of these?  Are these all, like, have you had...  Do you have contributions or are these all you?  They're pretty much all me.  I mean, there were people who chipped in a bit.  Uh, my brother actually was pretty good. 
[02:46:30]  He's the one who came up with, uh, horrendous evidence, which is when you wake up and your  apartment looks like a crime scene because there's panties strewn all over the place,  bras, you know, there's evidence for a horn the night before.  What do you call your brother?  That would be a hard thing to come up with.  Yeah.  Bro, bro?  He's my true bro.  He's my, uh, flesh and blood.  Yeah, but I mean, like, what do you call your brother in bro-speak like that?  In, uh, vocabulary.  You know, the bro of all bros.  Just a bro, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Has anyone ever told you that you sound exactly like Kevin Smith?  Oh my God, he does.  The voice actually is very similar.  Yeah, do you know that?  I didn't know that, no.  Jesus.  Oh wow, now that's creeping me out.  Yeah.  Wow.  I like this, you got a whole thing here.  It's like a, I like the, uh, it's hard, it's like activities she wants to butt in on  why you aren't having it and your excuse.  Like activities she wants to butt in on watching the game, which everyone's had to deal with. 
[02:47:30]  You're trying to watch the game and she's going to put her face in there.  Why you aren't having it?  Because she'd be like an annoying two-year-old asking,  Daddy, what's a touchdown?  What's a fumble?  What's a pigskin?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  And now your excuse is, you're superstitious for 20 years, you haven't let anyone whose  first name starts with whatever her initial is, watch the game with you because it jinxes  the team.  This includes your mom.  Sorry, babe, I know it's crazy, but that's just the way it is.  But when my team wins, I'll buy you a milkshake.  For the woman or for the kid? 
[02:48:00]  That's an example of a Jersey girl, which is a girl who, um, who doesn't really follow  football.  She just wears the Jersey just to kind of bro along with her boyfriend.  Oh, I like that because I was just at a hockey game and you see those, uh, those chicks.  Yeah.  They're irritating.  They're just like the quarterback, you know, they're the ones who love, uh, well, that's  why they came up with the pink version of the Jersey.  So the chicks could wear the pink.  Yeah.  And the hats and all that shit.  What's a manti? 
[02:48:30]  Mantis are, uh, panties that, um, that you would wear after hooking up with a girl when  you, um, when you're, uh, you know.  So don't have fresh, uh, tighty whities at your disposal.  And that's an example of a word that, you know, I kind of made it a mix of, uh, things  that guys actually do and that guys would never do in a million years.  Uh, not sober anyway.  Yeah.  Just to kind of keep the girls guessing, you know, women who read the book, I think their,  uh, reaction a lot of the times is do guys actually do this stuff? 
[02:49:00]  Right.  And, um, you know, they have to kind of figure out, figure that out with their boyfriend.  How come you have guy dolls, acceptable guy dolls and false guy dolls?  Those are guy dolls.  Oh, I was saying.  Guy dolls with a guy.  Oh, I see.  I get it.  What does that mean?  You know, guys that you look up to, your, uh, your heroes, you know, uh, like Brad Pitt  and stuff?  Like, uh, Chuck Norris, you know.  Well, acceptable, like they, you have to kind of compare and contrast.  Hockey players are acceptable.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, ice skaters are not.  Yeah.  Hard drinkers like Bukowski are acceptable. 
[02:49:30]  Sure.  Deep thinkers like Plato are not.  Um, Scott Peterson's acceptable.  Mm-hmm.  Nice husbands are not.  Jake Lamont's way of problem solving is acceptable.  Talking things out are not.  Do you know any lines from, like, do you know any, like, uh,  silent Bob lines?  You're asking me?  Yeah.  No.  Is this Kevin Smith? 
[02:50:00]  No, he does sound like Kevin, but it's not Kevin.  How do you know?  Okay, I'm reading this.  It's not Kevin.  No one else has told you you sound just like Kevin Smith?  I've never heard that, no.  Are you doing, like, a Seinfeld when Seinfeld, like, put out a book and,  but it wasn't under Seinfeld's name, but then everyone found out it was Seinfeld?  Did he really do that, like, Stephen King with Richard Bachman?  Yeah, a little of that, right?  How long did it take you to actually, uh, to write this?  Uh, it's hard to say.  It didn't take, um, you know, it took about a year. 
[02:50:30]  That's it?  Wow.  It took about a year.  There was a lot of, uh, procrastination involved.  Ah, ha, ha.  But, uh...  Ah, crap.  That was procrastination.  It's obviously another more wordplay, but...  That's very clever, because a lot of us, we have things to do,  but we end up spending time jerking off instead.  Procrastination.  It's fucking mind-boggling.  Right, Jimmy can relate to that.  I can.  What's a deudonym?  A deudonym is, um, you know, like McLovin.  It's your pseudonym that refers, you know, guys never call each other by their real names, 
[02:51:00]  so, you know.  No?  Yeah, that's true.  You gotta have a deudonym.  You also have a brudonym, like, uh...  What's your deudonym?  Abraham Drinkin, who makes a, uh, inebriation proclamation.  Ah.  Uh, four horrors.  Better than the real one.  Yeah, exactly.  What is your, uh, what is your deudonym?  Um, I go by, uh, Danimal.  Danimal!  Danimal.  You know, the Danimal.  I also had a career as a competitive eater, and, uh, I was referred to as the fly, because  I was on food like a fly. 
[02:51:30]  They called me that when a dominator was shit in my mouth.  Well, you know, it happens.  Danimal.  Jim, what's your, like, manly name?  What's that?  Do you have, like, a Danimal name?  No, I've actually never, I never had one.  I really, uh...  Really?  Yeah, I would love to have, like, a...  Can you give one to Jim?  Like, can you work off the name Jim?  Is it always off the name, or is it also off behavior?  Yeah, that's a good question.  It's usually, uh, it's usually off behavior.  That's what, the brudonym would be, like, you know, your, your behavior while you're drinking, 
[02:52:00]  you know, uh...  Oh, wow.  If you're, uh...  Jim aside.  You know, you could be, like, Saddam Broussain, or, uh...  I want to be Anthbrony.  That's kind of cool, right?  I could be, like, hey, Anthbrony.  I'm Bagless Jimmy.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, Bagless Jimmy Wolves.  The thing with a name like Jim, I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty manly to begin with, so...  Yeah.  Spell it G-Y-M.  Your Jims are your...  Jim the Shim.  You can only go down from there, like Jimmy or Joey, or... 
[02:52:30]  Or, uh, like, I, I sometimes I like to go to the Jimmy-nasium.  Yeah, Jimmy-nasium would be good for you.  That's manly.  See, that's why we're not writing the book, and Daniel is.  Our stuff is lame compared to this.  Uh, Guybernation, we did that one, right?  Guybernation is when you shut yourself in, you, uh, you don't, you know, maybe you've  bro-deed, you've over-deed on, you're overdosed on your bros, and you just kind of, uh, go in  and you've got to pump your stomach.  Rod Stewart bro-deed. 
[02:53:00]  Robert Reed.  Yeah, they all did, sure.  Wow, this is, uh, pretty good stuff.  The, uh, the cup grade?  What's the cup grade?  Cup grade is when you're dating, you know, a B cup, and you, uh, you cup grade to another...  She returns 15, and...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, and you get a chick, I actually like chicks with smaller tits, though, to be honest with  you.  I mean, I guess...  They're much better shaped.  They are.  And, uh, much firmer.  Easier to bite.  Right. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you, there's a whole chapter on titty-o-syncrasies.  Titty-o-syncrasies?  Uh, how did we not know?  What page is that on?  You got, um, you got the scariolas, which are areolas, which are so big, they're scary.  See, I actually like that.  I like a big, I like a big brown one.  Yeah.  Do you?  I want to throw someone mush diarrhea on their kids.  Dude, I'm so with you on that one.  What I like are the gripples.  The gripples?  Wow.  What are the gripples?  What are the gripples?  You know? 
[02:54:00]  Oh, I like that.  Oh, yeah.  I like the thing that's gripping.  That's fucking hilarious.  What else about the breast?  Because it's amazing.  Everyone's got different breast tape.  Titty-o-syncrasies.  Titty-o-syncrasies.  Well, there's also, um...  Jimmy.  The man-sectomy.  No offense to guys who, uh, who like smaller breasts, but there's also gay-ups.  You ever hear Olivia Newton gone?  Oh, we're talking about titty-o-syncrasies, of course.  Oh, just having some fun. 
[02:54:30]  Good gravy.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Titty-o-syncrasies.  Titty-o-syncrasies.  We're just trying to come up with our own, just to have some fun with this.  There go the floodgates.  What were you saying about, uh, something, uh...  What was the one you said just before that?  Uh, the one...  For, uh...  A guy who likes a smaller, uh...  Smaller breast is a gay cup, which is eight cups that are so small, they make you feel gay. 
[02:55:00]  Ah, there's nothing there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those are a little rough.  Christina flat as a plate.  But, uh...  I never, I never, I never thought gay in that, in that case.  I always thought, like, underage.  Well...  You think underage.  Yeah.  Kyle S. from...  Well, Kyle S. from Indiana wants to help you with...  What's the chapter called?  Titty-o-syncrasies?  Yeah, well, Kyle S. from Indiana.  Christina Appelgott. 
[02:55:30]  Do you have anything about...  Because I like larger vagus.  Do you have anything, like, about clits or anything like that?  Ah, yeah.  Uh, there is, yeah.  Like a clitoris?  There's, like, a clit that belongs on a dinosaur?  Nice.  That's pretty good.  Because Jimmy likes the big ones.  He likes the big ones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything like, uh...  I like a clit that's like the clitiot who doesn't know his way around...  Oh, the pussy?  A clitiot.  I like that.  All right.  I like that.  God, you have a million of them.  You have anything...  Yeah, I guess there would be clitiosyncrasies. 
[02:56:00]  Maybe I'll save that for the, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  When we're not filming movies.  You should write something about, like, the smell under the hood.  Hey, you got anything on the shitter?  There's an entire chapter of shitter-chatter.  Oh, it's called shitter-chatter?  Shitter-chatter.  Shitter-chatter.  Oh, okay.  That sounds too much like shitter-chatter.  That's like when you over-populate the bowl.  When the bowl is, uh, over-populated...  Oh, when she says she's gonna...  She hasn't taken a depository, and she has.  The next thing you know, it's all over your chest. 
[02:56:30]  And then you gotta pay her.  Oh, believe me.  She's not even the Russian that was in the ad.  She's like, excuse me, madam.  You put wet hay on my chest.  Ma'am, someone spilled gulags on my chest.  I'm paying for a solid log here.  Oh, oh.  Excuse me, miss.  I don't want to pay for a fucking jerk chicken  off my fucking chin and neck. 
[02:57:00]  What about, uh, you got blocabulary?  Now, this is good, because the...  You know, us guys, we like the...  We like the blowjobs, right?  Is that what you do when you're out with your friend,  and cabulary?  Hey, that can be good.  For the second book, sir.  Uh, what's some of the blocabulary you like?  Blocabulary, um, well, there's the blowjobligation.  When you do a, um, when you do a favor for a girl,  you help her move or something,  you change her tire, and she owes you a blowjob.  She's blowjobligated to you. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, blowjobligated.  That's very clever.  Is that like when you drive someone, like, far from home,  and you say, uh, suck it, or you're gonna walk?  Or you're gonna end up in a shallow grave?  Exactly.  Not quite.  I wouldn't take it that far.  Of course not.  Saving your life with a sucking mist cold.  You wanna, you wanna explain, uh, chap's dick?  Uh, chap's dick...  What I like to put in my mouth.  That's just a, chap's dick is, uh...  Oh, go on.  Chap's...  That's hilarious. 
[02:58:00]  What's, what's your definition of chap's dick?  Uh, chap's dick is just a dick that you rub on our lips,  like chapstick.  Yep, yep.  It's pretty, pretty straightforward.  Mm-hmm.  I, uh, my favorite in the, in the blowjob, um, you know, uh, chapter is Maxell,  when you're, uh, like the Maxell guy, the Maxell cassette guy who is leaning back in the...  Yeah.  ...a leather chair.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm right.  Maxell.  How old are you?  Yeah.  What are you getting blown away?  I always thought that, like, when a guy was... 
[02:58:30]  What, what, what's the point of that one?  Is, like, that she's queefing on you and your hair's blowing back?  Ha ha ha.  Dude.  Uh, no, just that you're in a comfortable chair, you know?  Yo, uh...  In a nice leather chair.  But how come the wind's blowing in the man's face?  Because it's a blowjob.  It's like he's listening to music during a tsunami.  Because he's actually getting a blowjob.  Hey, uh, I like your...  I want to read this, because this is very clever.  No, all right.  Eating disorder is, uh, an eating disorder that's specific to cockaholics.  Yeah.  I've never seen someone with such an eating disorder. 
[02:59:00]  She was a total penis fly trap.  Oh, they like that one.  Did you reread this and go back over and find ones you missed?  Like, if you would write one, would you go back over and, like, have somebody reread it  and go, well, look, you could change this word, you could change that word?  Like, how many passes through did you do?  Yeah.  Seriously.  Yeah, I did, I did, uh...  You know, with, you know, with any manuscript, you reread it, you add some more words.  Right.  It did get very pun-heavy, which is why it might be described as pun-ish-ment.  Oh, nice.  You know, there's no, there's no avoiding puns if you're, if you're doing guy talk. 
[02:59:30]  You know, it's a crucial, uh, crucial element.  That's true.  You got a lot of it, man.  I like, I like...  Why would, why would bros, why would bros care about a boomer wang?  Oh, that's gone.  You've never, I mean, you've never watched porn and seen a dick that was  exactly like you, you're, well, that's a doppel-wanger.  The boomer wang is like, that's in, I think that's in the, um, the, uh, you know, spank-speak 
[03:00:00]  chapter.  It's just a, uh, a curved penis.  You know, there needs to be a word for it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Um, I like this one, catheter.  Yeah, we're all going through the book, kid.  Someone who's a worse than a pain in the ass, they're a pain in the dick.  Yeah.  Uh.  You could also call them penile cancer.  Mm-hmm.  Wait, does crack-tivities?  What's crack-tivities?  Crack-tivities, just any activities related to, uh, the smoking of crack or, you know. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Other sorts of cracks.  Yeah.  Uh.  What's a give-yourself-a-grinspection?  That's, uh, when you have a bang-over.  Uh, bang-over is when you, uh, wake up after a night of excessive banging, and you want to  make sure that you're, uh, you know, not too obvious when you roll into the office.  You want to, you know, uh, give yourself a grinspection, make sure there's no short  and curlies in your, uh, in your teeth.  Wow.  That never happens to me.  They don't have hair yet.  He's got to give you a dick one, make sure the braces have him torn. 
[03:01:00]  And by those, I mean the ones on our legs.  I love a polio kid.  Yeah.  What are they going to do?  It's a good day for him.  Hey, uh, a girl on a whore path.  What's that all about?  Um.  What's a whore path?  Yeah, she's on the whore path, but it's, uh.  Oh, war whore.  Oh, I get it.  Yeah.  All right.  I think that's an example of, uh, when you're having a retargument, which is a retarded  argument with your girlfriend. 
[03:01:30]  Ah, well.  Isn't that anything?  Yes.  Or a discussion with a retard, which is always fun.  Don't put your tongue in there.  What's a bathlete?  A bathlete is, uh, you know, that would replace the word metrosexual, which is kind of tired,  but a bathlete is just someone who's an athlete about bathing, grooming, you know.  Oh, they meant around bathhouses.  A bathlete's a guy who can, who can, uh, go from bench to bench in the bathhouse and 
[03:02:00]  fucking drink out of mules.  We got it, Jim.  This, uh, this book is, you know, God.  This always goes there.  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  Christina apple-less.  Shit got no apples. 
[03:02:30]  Sorry, sir.  We just, we, we laugh at ourselves a lot.  The book really should be more of, like, a Wikipedia thing where people can, uh, can  tweak entries and, and, uh, kind of make their own.  Yeah.  You got a, you got a website, do you?  Drill pill.  What's it, no, it's a drill pill.  Yeah.  That's probably like Viagra or something, right?  It's like Viagra.  Oh, see, I went with Flintstones Chewable.  If you're about to commit Viagra-vated assault, uh, you definitely.  Ah, Viagra-vated assault.  That's kind of like aggravated assault, but with your dick out and a hammer. 
[03:03:00]  Right.  This book is, um, all right.  Uh, yeah, if you want to go to the website, if you want to suggest words, um, go to www.brocab.com.  And people can suggest words at brocab.com?  People can write in.  Oh, that'd be terrific.  This, this, uh.  Can they post them?  Absolutely, yeah.  I can post them for them, but.  Oh, people can't just go post?  Our listeners are very interactive.  Uh, you can comment, but, um, probably the best way is to just email me and, uh, I'll put 
[03:03:30]  them up.  All right, what's the, uh.  Yeah, what's your email address?  No, no, what's, what's the, uh.  What's the, uh, yeah.  If you just go to, uh, brocab.com, you'll, uh, there'll be like an email me button.  Yeah, okay.  Are you, uh, planning on selling a lot of these?  That's the plan, yeah.  Have you got out and done book signings and stuff like that?  Um, not yet, no.  I have, um, I have put my, uh, blot-o-graph on a lot of them, which is when you, uh.  Oh.  You sign your credit card when you're totally wasted.  What's it called?  Blot-o-graph.  Why the blot, though?  Well, you're blot, though. 
[03:04:00]  You're totally blot.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  What is this, a shot glass put?  Shot glass put is, um, there's advice on when you get into a Neander brawl in a bar,  when a bargument turns into a Neander brawl, and, uh, you're going to want to use, like,  the Q-E-Ville slugger, like the, uh, pool cue that you, uh, that you slug someone over  the head with.  Shot glass put is, you know, you take a shot glass and heave it like a shot put across the  room at someone.  Yeah.  Um, so there's a lot of brawl, uh, bar brawl advice. 
[03:04:30]  What is the, um, what?  What's Flack Friday?  Yeah.  Flack Friday is, you know.  It's amazing, by the way, you actually remember all these offhand.  I know, it's amazing.  Um, yeah, I'm kind of amazed myself.  It's like you don't have a job or something.  Flack Friday is, like, Friday rolls around, your girl wants to be with you, you want to  be with your boys, you're going to get flack from someone no matter what you do, whether  you see the chick flick with her or you see the dick flick with them, you know, someone  is going to be pissed off at you.  Wait, chick flick with her or a dick flick with them?  Yeah, she wants to go out and see the new, like, you know, Tyler Perry movie or something. 
[03:05:00]  Your guys want to go out and see the new Die Hard movie, you know, you're damned if you,  uh, dude, you're damned.  I mean, yes, you're damned if you do and you're in 1985 if you're, like, that's if you're in  a bad relationship.  So, um, how long was it till your, uh, bros told you, all right, enough with the fucking  puns?  Yeah.  I'm wondering when you're going to tell me that.  No.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  They, uh, they, um...  Brian from St. Louis, Melissa Lessridge.  I don't know why.  It's definitely to be taken in small doses.  Keep it by the toilet.  Read it, you know, one entry at a time.  Yeah.  Run out of toilet paper.  That's true.  Shitterature.  That's, uh, the book you put by the bowl, right?  Okay.  217 pieces of...  Um, where, where are you actually, were you a New Yorker? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Yes.  Oh, no.  What did he say, keep it by the what?  And I forgot.  What?  By the shitter.  Oh.  Or the, um... 
[03:06:30]  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Wait for it. 
[03:07:00]  What the fuck?  I've never seen anybody. 
[03:07:30]  Jesus.  Would you have for breakfast a sponge?  Wow, maybe that's gotta be changed.  Wow.  Okay, so it's vocabulary. 
[03:08:00]  Okay, so it's vocabulary.  Is he gone?  It's known as the urinal book.  No.  Still hanging.  Sorry for the interruption.  No problem.  Ew. 
[03:08:30]  I've never seen anybody go that long.  It's amazing.  All right.  So.  What's a slurchous?  Slurchous is, you know, when you're at the bar, you're making...  Go away.  Go away.  Go away.  Jesus. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, God.  A book is fun while you're in a bookstore and you're browsing for 30 seconds while your  chick's buying a book or something.  Oh, my God.  How do you piss for so long?  Amazing.  Are you fucking holding that in since last year?  Jesus.  That's probably what's wrong with your shoulder.  You're holding piss all the way up to it.  Yeah.  Piss.  Oh.  That's some hazard waste now. 
[03:09:30]  Wow.  That is like...  That whole garbage pill has to go.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  That was wonderful.  Well, not to piss, apparently.  Well, unless you're not done yet.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  We'll take a little break.  What a jerk.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and continue with the show?  Alrighty.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  All right.  We're back with the show.  We're trying to figure out what the fuck's wrong with Joe Biden.  Joe Biden.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ba-ba.  He's speaking live on TV and he's got hair plugs that...  He didn't go for the what?  He ran out of money or something? 
[03:10:30]  He's one of those guys that ran out of money.  Now, that looks like he went with hair plugs.  Which...  Bro plugs.  Bro plugs.  Bro plugs.  Oh, hair bros.  Hair bros.  Yeah, it doesn't even have to make sense.  there you go. I like how you turned his book  into a urinal cake book.  What if someone said I turned  his book into the yellow pages? Into the yellow pages.  Whoever you were.  Yeah. Great line. You took a  brovis on it.  Wow. 
[03:11:00]  Well, I was  going to try to work off boredom. Brodom?  Brodom. I was brodom. That's when  your bro is sucking on your scrotum, though.  Yeah. I've given you  some brodom.  Teabagging your bro. Yeah.  The Broman War Helmet.  It's when you lay your balls on your  bro's fucking bridge of his nose.  The bridge of his bros.  What's teabagging your  bro called?  That's  T-Brogue. No. 
[03:11:30]  What? It's called gay.  It's called  fucking gay.  Should have known that. Yeah, Biden looks  like he went with  the old school hair plugs where they took  like a cookie cutter  and like cut  big fucking rings  out of your head  and then put them in the front  and then he just  combs that over.  Like, he's got  a comb over  and plugs.  Well, you gotta comb it  all the way to the back.  Well, that's what he...  But he can't.  It doesn't look like  he could grow it that long.  So he's got like a 
[03:12:00]  four inch part  on one side  and then the back  is showing  and then he got  his eyes done.  Like you said,  he got an eye job  or something?  He looks like  a newborn puppy.  You know when a newborn puppy  it's all wet  and everything is slicked back?  Slicked back.  The face and everything  because it just  squished through  the cunt of the dog.  The doggy cunt.  He looks like  he's wearing  a pharaoh helmet.  He's just...  And he just...  He looks like  the meanest  son of a bitch.  I bet you 
[03:12:30]  he hates women.  Just...  Yeah.  Oh, you can only hope.  He's a woman.  He looks like a meanie.  He just looks like  either the dean of boys  at a school  or that fucking  supervisor at work  that just  is constantly  bitching at you.  He wants to be  the vice president.  Yes, but he can't be.  You think he has  bad breath?  Because he looks like  he has dentures and stuff  that he probably doesn't  So you think it's like  coffee and cigarettes  or something?  And then his eyes  don't close  because he had eye work  and then he's got  the chicken neck. 
[03:13:00]  The chicken neck  coming out the wobble  coming out the top  of his tie.  Yeah.  Those suits.  Old men,  when they got to wear  that suit,  it just pushes  everything up  above the tie  and collar.  Yeah.  It's the big thing.  It's actually his navel.  Hey,  before we move on  to our next bit  because we just go  from bit to bit  to bit around here.  Yes, we do.  Hold on a minute.  Well,  someone's trying to make  a Cheryl no joke  instead of Cheryl Crow.  Mark O'Hara  from Houston.  I think so.  Jamie Hughes 
[03:13:30]  from Tom's River  writes,  that asshole  made me want  to bro my brains out.  Mike in Delaware,  Ramone,  this guy's a bromosexual.  Yeah.  I think we did that.  Tim C.  from Cleveland,  I'd like to be  teabagged by my bro.  His balls smell  like my bro,  bro,  uh,  uh,  bro,  uh,  onions with bro  in front of it.  Help me here.  Bro,  bro,  bro,  bro,  a brunion.  Right.  How about a,  uh,  a rusty Trombrone 
[03:14:00]  Chrissy from Virginia?  That fucking douche  in his bro book.  It's horrendous.  Well,  P-Bone writes  from Tampa,  he could get some gel  and make a bro hawk.  Uh,  yeah,  bro Biden.  His book,  fucking bros.  Oh wait,  hold on a minute.  You guys,  you know,  we have to continue  with this.  Jeremy from Jersey.  Yes,  Jeremy.  Morning,  shit dicks.  Hey,  Biden probably  should have used  some bro gain. 
[03:14:30]  A little bro gain.  But now he's doing  the brome over.  Didn't someone call  Master Poe  Master Bro Day?  Master Bro.  Yeah.  Oh,  well,  bropy.  And Manthony.  And Manthony,  yeah.  That's right.  And faggot.  Oh.  Well,  I can't think of  anything for Jimmy.  How about just this?  How about  It's the, 
[03:15:00]  uh,  Bropy and Manthony show.  Yeah,  Bropy and Manthony.  That's what we should  change it to.  I'm him Norton.  Him Norton,  yes.  Him Nort man.  Yeah,  him Nort man.  And Manny.  Manny is,  Manny.  Ugh,  this is fucking awful.  This is wonderful.  Who else do we have?  Trav ass.  Yeah.  That's,  uh. 
[03:15:30]  A boo.  A boo.  All right,  you want to,  uh,  do a little pendulum  or what?  Oh yeah,  please.  We got a pendulum contest  and I think we could  start playing some of the entries.  Give me the hook to pendulum.  Please.  Uh,  uh,  uh,  love it.  You change me into something  that I just can't control.  You see me gone  and let's get out of my way.  That's your love  is swinging back  the other way.  Wow. 
[03:16:00]  Simon Kenton from Virginia.  I like,  I'd like to bro the bro boat  out into Brodesto Bay.  Wait,  this update is,  fuck.  Hold on a minute.  Brodesto Bay  and dump that Bromo Brover  the side of the broat.  Mm,  mm,  mm,  mm,  mm,  mm.  If you see me coming,  let's get out of my way.  So,  so we're looking for, 
[03:16:30]  uh,  interpretations of that song,  not necessarily,  uh,  covers,  right?  We want very,  we want a lot of different versions  of pendulum.  Right.  At least one good one  if we can possibly get it.  We're hoping.  We got a few here.  We got,  uh,  we could start with chemistry.  If you want,  you don't have to start there.  Where do you want me to start,  Danny?  What makes the most sense?  You heard these.  Which one do you want to play today?  See,  they're all so good in their own way.  Yeah.  That's the thing about these.  You like this one?  I really,  uh,  actually,  my,  my favorite is actually track five, 
[03:17:00]  but,  uh,  so we'll go four,  five.  We can do that.  All right,  number four.  Track four,  yeah,  this,  this is by a guy,  that's the only contact name  he left us,  D-O-T-Y Sancho.  Okay.  And,  uh,  this one is kind of like,  this one is very,  Sanch bro.  That's right.  It reminds me of like an,  uh,  it's kind of like an 80s movie credits version.  Oh,  nice.  It sounds,  it almost sounds like,  uh,  like a John Hughes film?  No,  I was thinking more along the lines of like the,  the credit sequence for like,  uh,  Escape from New York.  Oh,  okay.  It's very synthesizer.  Oh,  really?  Okay.  Like Steve sitting here waiting eagerly to hear his interpretations. 
[03:17:30]  I've heard a few of these.  Steve,  take your hat off.  Oh,  you want to see the hair?  Yeah.  Let's see how that's coming in.  Holy fuck.  What'd you do?  Now you're completely bald.  Yeah.  Well,  the,  uh,  the toupee look was really ridiculous.  Now it's just,  the toupee look.  Ha ha ha.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  What's happening to you?  That looks like you did it.  That looks like you did that just so they could put the electrodes on you.  Doesn't it?  You're doing everything someone does before they murder their coworkers. 
[03:18:00]  It looks like Brando from Apocalypse Now.  Yeah.  What a wonderful idea.  It's definitely,  a private pile cut.  It certainly is.  I knew that was going to happen.  I am in a world of shit.  Ha ha ha.  Looks like Lobo from Ed Wood.  A man of his size would have trouble.  The private's weapon's name is Bob.  The,  uh,  that,  uh,  that fucking first version toupee look was really,  really awful and I just couldn't do it.  What made you get that at first?  I was too lazy to go to the barber. 
[03:18:30]  No,  that doesn't make sense.  So you did it yourself?  That doesn't make sense.  I was too lazy to go to the barber so I had my-  Why don't you just keep your hair long?  You don't like,  like,  keep the top long?  I initially thought it would look-  Don't look at me.  What?  You're scaring me.  Why?  I'm not even kidding.  You're creepy.  No.  I'm lovable.  Look at Jimmy.  Hi,  Jimmy.  Hi.  Hi,  sweetie.  Does this look right in you?  Oh,  this is weird.  It is really weird.  This whole fucking crew is weird.  Yeah,  I'm gonna get to that.  Yeah.  This whole staff is weird.  Shut up and sit down,  you big bald fuck. 
[03:19:00]  Hey,  Tim C from,  uh,  Cleveland.  I heard that-  Tim C?  I heard that,  uh,  I heard that Manthony-  Yes.  dated a chick whose ass leaked like the Exxon Brodez.  That doesn't even make sense.  Yeah,  but I'm trying to get the bit going here.  Yeah,  because they're all coming up with stuff.  This bit is brover.  It really is.  Uh,  they're not-  Steven S says you,  you didn't have a toupee,  you had a,  a,  a,  a tube,  a tube-k. 
[03:19:30]  Tube-k.  No.  All right,  Steve.  I'm getting here.  So why don't we listen to the first,  first,  uh,  pendulum song.  Entry.  Right.  Based on your fine hit song from back in the day.  Out of my way.  This is acid melon.  This is,  uh,  thank you.  Just cut your head open.  Here we go.  No,  I meant like really.  Exactly.  Looks like a melon.  You said melon's on the empty candy dish.  Oh,  yeah. 
[03:20:00]  I'm Snake Plissken,  by the way.  Or like the beginning of like,  They Live or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's not bad,  Sam.  Yeah.  And the level's weak is a little bit of pressure. 
[03:20:30]  Need to slow it and to protect you.  Slow you, slow you, it's time to slow you.  Oh.  Oh.  I guess they had one good mic.  Sounds like he's singing through his guitar pickups.  Yeah.  It's kind of cool, though.  Here we go.  My heart's getting heavy, my blood's getting cold. 
[03:21:00]  You're chasing into something that I just can't console.  If you see me come and let's get out of my way.  There's things you'll ever swing and back the other way.  Derek has Escape from New York queued up.  That sounds like every John Carpenter theme ever written.  Yeah.  Hey, listen to this.  Yes. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Danny, you nailed it.  Yeah, that's hard, man.  Yeah.  It's like a damn good theme song about me.  My heart's getting heavy, my heart's getting heavy.  Yeah, it's really good.  It's a bad synthesizer.  Listen to that crap.  You don't like this?  No.  You know what's funny?  John Carpenter did a lot of his own tunes.  Yeah, he wrote them.  He was really into a lot of his music.  And this is, I think, one of his compositions.  I like this.  Not quite Robert Rodriguez. 
[03:22:00]  That's great.  The Halloween theme was John Carpenter's song.  That's great.  Yeah.  I'm not feeling this one.  No?  It's too monotonous.  Exactly.  Because the verse, he doesn't go anywhere.  No, he doesn't go anywhere.  Like I said, these things, they're all good in their own way. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, I kind of like that.  Which one do you want to do before five?  I want something with a little action to it.  You could do chems, I guess.  Chemistry?  Yeah.  Chemistry did his rap version with DJ Twig.  Oh, I heard this one.  It was just that. 
[03:23:00]  It's brutal.  You got it.  You got it.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  It's changed me into something I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  Because the pendulum will swing it back the other way.  The pendulum can take only so much yelling. 
[03:23:30]  So what do you do next time?  There's no telling.  Bump you, jump you.  It's going to dump you out.  You got it.  The pendulum will break under too much tension.  Break down the walls of my detention.  Rack and ball in kingdom.  Falling down, down, down, down, down.  You need to climb, not the time.  Now you got to pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I had a lightning circle of your screaming in my ear.  My back is going to break.  You can push me one more time.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  It's changing into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way. 
[03:24:00]  Because the pendulum will swing it back the other way.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  Damn.  Chemistry with his version of Pendulum.  Yeah.  All right.  That was Steve the Bear.  Or any other chemistry.  Go ahead.  Any other chemistry song.  Sorry, chemistry.  And then we have G-Bo.  Is he doing a rap thing too?  Yeah.  This is another hip-hop one.  And I mean, I know Kem's been a soldier over the years.  But I really got to give it to G-Bo on this one. 
[03:24:30]  I think he really...  Oh.  He takes the hip-hop thing.  He made it work really well.  G-Bro.  Enough of the bro shit.  The pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day.  Another day of condescension as it locks you.  Shocks you.  Gonna lock all your bitches down.  The pendulum will strip with a little bit of pressure. 
[03:25:00]  If you move too slow, then the pendulum will get you.  If it will show you, move you.  Couldn't have thrown your way, mass around.  You did the crime, but not the time, not the time.  Now you gotta pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take.  Of you screaming in my ear.  Now my back is gonna break.  If you push me one more goddamn time.  My heart is getting heavy and my blood is getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  And if you see me coming, just get out of my way.  Because the pendulum is swinging back the other way. 
[03:25:30]  Gotcha!  I'm digging this one.  It's pretty cool, right?  Yeah.  Hey, yo, the pendulum can take only so much.  Yeah, but what he'll do next?  You know there is no telling.  He might bump you, jump you.  Gonna dump your fat ass out.  The pendulum will break under too much tension.  Breaking down the walls of my detention.  Wrecking, falling, kingdom falling down. 
[03:26:00]  You did the crime, but not the time, not the time.  Now you gotta pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take.  Of you screaming in my ear.  Now my back is gonna break.  If you push me one more goddamn time.  My heart is getting heavy and my blood is getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  And if you see me coming, just get out of my way.  Because the pendulum is swinging back the other way.  My heart is getting heavy and my blood is getting cold. 
[03:26:30]  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  And if you see me coming, just get out of my way.  Because the pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Gotcha!  Damn.  Rockstar China wants to know if this was written by a knee bro.  Jesus Christ.  That asshole's got us fucking saying that.  That's enough of this book.  Get it out of here.  Jibo, right on.  That's really good.  Yeah, that one was pretty good.  Someone said a little bit of Gangster Paradise in there. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah!  Travis saying it sounds like a cake song.  Yeah, you remember the band Cake?  No, I love cake.  Yeah, like going the distance.  There's no cake.  Cake's a lie.  Should we play these others just to taste?  Yeah, you can.  All right, we'll play these until you guys hate them.  Jamie Sweetland came up with his version of Pendulum.  Yeah, this one.  Oh.  Is that a cover?  Yeah. 
[03:27:30]  I don't know what he was going for here.  Because you'll see, the verse doesn't match the chorus at all.  That sounds like...  I don't know what he was waiting at the center of attention.  Just another day, another condescension.  Mark you, shock you, gonna lock you down.  Petrolab will shock to the little bit of pressure.  We're too slow and the petrolab will get you.  Show you, mow you, gonna throw you around.  Like Molly Hatchett.  You did the crime at the time.  Now you're gonna think more when you run your bedroom.  And all the things that come while you're screaming in my ear. 
[03:28:00]  Back is gonna break.  You will see you one more time.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Jamie Sweetland.  Not bad.  Someone says it sounds like a car commercial.  Sounds like Clutch?  Sounds kind of like Clutch. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  And then we got Matt W sent this one in.  Oh.  Baba Lou.  Baba Lou.  Aye.  Yeah, this one's more like a straight cover.  Oh, okay.  I've never covered.  We'll get to the off at least.  There's a little updated sound.  This is the sixth version in a row that's better than the original.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:29:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Just another day, another condescension.  Mark you, shock you, gonna lock you down.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  And you'll see a little bit of pressure.  Move too slow.  And you'll look at you.  Show you, mow you.  Don't throw you around. 
[03:29:30]  Egypt, the crime, but not the time.  Now you gotta pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I could take for you screaming in my ear.  My back is gonna break if you push me one more time.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You change me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me come, it best get out of my way.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, that's not bad, huh?  Just your basic updated cover kind of thing.  Want to hear more or?  No.  No.  No.  I'm good.  Maybe, yeah, yeah.  I hate to blow the whole wad in one day.  Yeah.  All right, we got one more.  Ponte, oh, Ponte Paul.  Pontius Pilate.  Ponte Paul, it's like.  This is the last one for today.  The pendulum contest. 
[03:30:30]  Uh-oh.  Burn her now.  Burn her now.  The pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day, another condescension.  Mock you, shock you, gonna lock you down. 
[03:31:00]  Old pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure.  Move too slow.  And the pendulum will get you.  Travis, this is on the soundtrack to Empire Records.  Yeah.  You did the crime, not the time.  Now you've got to pay.  For what you've done, you better run.  I've had all I can take.  All your screaming in my ear.  My back is going to break if you push me one more time.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold. 
[03:31:30]  Changed me into something that I just can't control.  It's like Steve meets the Friends theme.  It is the Friends theme.  That's what I was trying to figure out.  I thought there was a little bit of a beer commercial in there somewhere also.  Yes.  You said beer for cum.  There's something that I just can't control.  If you see me come, it's best to get out of my way.  Because the pendulum is swinging.  We're moving back the other way. 
[03:32:00]  I like that.  That's pretty goofy.  All right, I'm...  All right, I'm...  All right, I'm...  The pendulum can only take so much yelling.  What he'll do next, hey, there's no telling.  Bump you, chump you, gonna dump you out.  The pendulum will break under too much tension. 
[03:32:30]  Breaking down the walls of my detention.  Wrecking, balling.  Kingdom falling down.  You did the crime, not the time.  Now you've got to pay.  For what you've done, you better run.  I've had all I can take.  All your screaming in my ear.  My back is gonna break.  If you push me one more time.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  Change me into something that I just can't control. 
[03:33:00]  If you see me coming, you best get out my way.  My heart's getting heavy and my blood's getting cold.  You change me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, you best get out my way.  That's ready, right?  Sounds like those awful Cablevision commercials.  Yeah.  And Bill in Portugal.  We got people all over the world today.  Holy shit, I never thought I'd hear a bare naked ladies version of Pendulum.  Pendulum. 
[03:33:30]  Many different versions coming in so far.  Yeah.  We'll swing them back the other way towards shit.  We got to do line of the day and get the hell out of here.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  We got some cross-town traffic we got to deal with today, right?  Pronto.  Fucking parade's gonna make fucking shit off.  Fucking fucking fuck.  Two runners up and one winner.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Can't you say anything?  What the fuck?  Footer, I pray someone gets famous.  What? 
[03:34:00]  Footer.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I'm praying that this song blows up and some loophole, then Steve doesn't get a fucking  dime and just say, no, no, no, I penned this song.  It's mine.  I penned it.  Yeah, they changed it just enough that it's not, they don't have to pay Steve nothing.  Yeah.  That's very mean-spirited.  Yes.  Actually, I have a request out there.  I hope he's listening.  I'm sure everybody's familiar with Sleeves from the Ron and Fez show.  Yes.  I would love to hear Sleeves cover Pendulum or do it in his own way.  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  I'm a big fan of his stuff.  Sleeves is good.  A little cross promoting would be nice.  Mm, that's nice.  A little bit of Sleeves.  Nice.  Swings back the other way, Fez.  Fez.  Right, let's get to the goddamn line of the day.  All right, Anthony, all right.  Get out of here.  I'm gonna fucking-  Where is Bond?  Stuck there.  Let's do a bro of the day.  Why is Bond? 
[03:35:00]  And it's gonna scatter some guineas crossing Fifth Avenue.  Yeah.  Pat from Hunaki.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're right.  How can-  I'm gonna get out of here in time.  How can Pat talk today with all the shitting he's doing?  Pat came in seventh place eating the pizzas.  Yeah.  I don't know how many people ate.  He stinks.  He's the worst at competitive eating.  Yeah, but he-  I don't know.  He's awful.  But how many do you eat?  Like the Joey fucking Chestnuts, that guy who wins the hot dog thing now,  he beats out that, that, that, uh, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Rhymes with, ha, ha. 
[03:35:30]  He ate 47 slices of pizza.  Holy shit.  47 fucking slices.  47 slices of pizza.  Right?  Was that what it said in the paper?  Yeah.  I was shocked.  I was, I was, I was proud.  I ate 19.  He ate 20.  Pat ate, I think.  Pat, help me out if you're out there.  27.  27, yeah.  Were they regular size slices?  It has to be.  Or were they, or like they bullshit Pizza Hut slices?  Because that's a huge difference.  Yeah.  Were they big slices, Pat?  Right, Pat.  Like regular ones?  But Pat, uh, was in the money. 
[03:36:00]  I think he-  It was small pies.  Yeah, there's no way.  Oh.  All right.  Faggot contest.  How many real fucking slices then?  Type two.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, uh, but Pat made like $250.  All right.  He's got some winnings under his belt.  Cool.  Congratulations to Pat.  Seventh place out of eight guys.  Not bad.  Manverpest wants to know if there was any garlic butter saw on the, uh, vermin pie.  What's, uh, this, uh, Webex all about?  And try to read line of the day copy with bro, brocabulary. 
[03:36:30]  Wow.  Let's see how good you-  Well, I gotta say Webex.com because they don't-  You want some kind of a fake thing.  Of course.  Uh-  Hold mantings.  Mantings.  Make, uh-  Pre-mantations.  Well, Jimmy, uh, you can do this.  And do it from the comfort-  Of your brome.  Of your own brome.  Of your brome, right, sure.  Or office.  Or brofus.  Um.  Brofus. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Got it.  Check guy out at Webex.com.  Yeah.  Three broners up.  We got some broners.  Travis noting that there is no bromo code for this particular plug.  No bromo code.  I got a broner.  Anybody else have a broner out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got some assholes.  Jimmy's got a broner.  That's when you get a boner when only bros are in the room. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, because you were taking-  What was the thing for the pills?  He had one for that too.  See, we weren't paying attention.  Well, we got the-  But we can go through it.  Who cares?  Line of the day.  Uh, runner-up line of the day.  Here's the first.  Have they ever made a bad kids movie?  Seriously.  We're kids in the theater just booing and then leaving the theater?  A boo.  Yeah, the woodsman.  Dad'll meet you in the-  The woodsman.  Woodsman. 
[03:38:00]  Such an obscure little movie.  Fantastic.  Living across from the school.  Watching all the little treats walking by.  Fucking rolled.  Jerks the kid off in the park.  Oh, god damn.  Come get your dick sucked behind a bush.  Sit on my lap.  Yeah, why not?  Here is another runner-up line of the D.  They also built a bathroom for each guy.  Oh, really?  A special candidate bathroom.  Well, that's the kind of thing I like.  I hope that trend continues. 
[03:38:30]  Nice.  Taking it right back to the 50s.  Yeah.  The last runner-up line of the day.  Oh, mama.  His lead is bigger.  And I hate to be a kook. 
[03:39:00]  The election will be soon.  We sure love laughing at racism.  Sure we do.  Can you guys, for Dr. October, please play the kitten in the basket bit?  That rolled.  When was that again?  A while ago.  I don't remember.  All right.  We have to get out of here.  So, WebEx.com, studio audience, thank you. 
[03:39:30]  Greatly appreciate it.  Yeah.  They were helping us out with that bit, by the way.  We told them to kind of play along and laugh.  And they did naturally.  And they did naturally to keep the bit going.  Because it was funny.  Audience participation.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  No offense to guys who like smaller breasts, but there's also gay cubs. 
[03:40:00]  You ever hear Olivia Newton gone?  Oh my god, we were supposed to get out of here early.  I know.  You better run, Ed. 
[03:40:30]  You're not going to make it up past the parade route.  They close at 11?  Yeah.  They can't pass all of them.  You're going to watch the whole parade.  Son of a bitch had a lot of friends, didn't he?  That's a fucking Kenny Wap best that's coming out of the woodwork.  I could have been kicking at Mr. Bandit's ass all over Long Island by now.  You know that I learned that we've been doing a lot of extra radio?  That we're supposed to end at 10.52 to get the commercials in?  Exactly.  And we make it to 11 every day?  All right.  Somebody owes us eight minutes of time.  Eight minutes?  Eight minutes time is a lot of days. 
[03:41:00]  Well, I'll give a call from my car.  All right.  Bye, y'all.  Later.  Later.  Later.  Now that the dead weight is gone, let's continue until noon.  Finally.  Finally. 
[03:41:30]  That's what I've dreamed of.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, later.  Travis, you want to do a show?  No.  All right, let's do a show.  All right, let's do a show.
