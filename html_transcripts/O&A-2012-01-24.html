<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and co-host Jimmy Norton, expressing furious outrage at their exclusion from broadcasting from the Super Bowl, despite prior agreements.  They unleashed a torrent of profanity directed at their superiors, particularly Gary, Rob, and Scott Greenstein, whom they derisively labeled a "lazy fucking egghead."  Their anger was fueled by the fact that other SiriusXM shows, like Covino and Rich and Sway, were selected, leading to speculation about favoritism and the presence of salespeople at the Super Bowl over additional programming.  They discussed a listener's obsessive video, reminisced about a past Super Bowl experience involving the delivery and installation of a large-screen TV, and engaged in numerous sexually explicit and crude digressions. A potential solution emerged when they learned Mad Dog Russo was giving away Super Bowl tickets, prompting further discussion and hopes of securing some for their own giveaway.  The segment ended with continued frustration over the lack of communication and perceived mistreatment.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a longstanding feud with comedian Jay Thomas, fueled by an incident involving a colleague named Ira, who was apparently terrified of Thomas.  The hosts again used profanity liberally, detailing Ira's reactions and lamenting the lack of respect shown to them by some within their workplace.  This transitioned into a discussion about a SiriusXM charity auction where the top prize was a day observing the Opie and Anthony show. The hosts highlighted the absurdity of this prize, especially for a North Carolina winner who had to cover travel and accommodation. They contrasted the low value placed on their show with other SiriusXM personalities featured in the auction, referencing several examples.  This led to a showcasing of clips from their "Real Rock TV" series, highlighting past stunts involving minor crimes like stealing Aerosmith's new single and a Super Bowl ticket, one featuring a puppet and possibly a wood chipper.  The hosts discussed the videos’ poor production quality and their own unprofessional behavior.  Studio guest Josh, a contest winner, participated in this discussion.  The segment also touched on various musicians and celebrities, including Aerosmith, Lucinda Williams, Joan Rivers, Bret Michaels, Danny McBride, Jesse Ventura, Jimmy Fallon, Michael Chiklis, and Steve-O, often using racial slurs and graphic sexual descriptions.

The next segment focused heavily on Josh, the auction winner, and the unexpected costs associated with his prize—including a $2,000 newspaper bill.  The hosts humorously dissected the absurdity of the situation, discussing mandatory signed t-shirts and travel expenses.  The conversation then explored their unfavorable timeslot compared to Sway Calloway's, complaining about syndication reach and lack of support from SiriusXM management.  A significant portion dealt with the tax implications of Josh's "prize," with the hosts jokingly speculating about a future IRS audit and consulting Twitter for tax advice.  Otto from Otto and George's "pigroast.tv" made a brief appearance, followed by a discussion of a photo of a SiriusXM executive (Blatter) with G-Unit, expressing their dislike for him. The recurring theme of Opie and Anthony's 17-year absence from Super Bowl broadcasts resurfaced, contrasting their situation with Covino and Rich's annual appearances, leading to further riffing on radio and SiriusXM audiences. The segment concluded with a discussion of E-Rock's near-death experience from the cinnamon challenge, playing the audio and detailing the event, interspersed with humor and genuine concern, followed by promotional mentions of Anthony Cumia's blackjack guide and Otto and George's "pigroast.tv."  The segment, again, was rife with profanity and vulgar language.


The show then transitioned to a discussion about Subway sandwiches, which the hosts vehemently disliked, contrasting them with their preference for Blimpy's and other delis. A major part focused on an aggressive encounter with Liz from pigroast.tv, who aggressively promoted her calendar, ending with the hosts throwing it in the parking lot.  They detailed various other topics: the challenges of street performing due to language barriers; a caller's (later proven false) story about a friend dying from Freon inhalation; anecdotes about their careers and New York City's changing landscape; promotions for Otto's "PigRoast.tv"; personal anecdotes and frustrations; and mentions of celebrities like Joan Rivers, Clint Eastwood, and Angelina Jolie, often in vulgar contexts.  Otto served as the primary in-studio guest, with caller Scott contributing to the Freon discussion. Several audio/video clips were played, maintaining the informal, profane, and crudely humorous tone throughout the segment.

The final "After ONA Live" segment, hosted by Sam Roberts, detailed the strained relationship between Sam and producer Troy, exacerbated by staff member Kenny's frustration over perceived changes in Troy's behavior and decreased collaboration.  Kenny felt Troy was ignoring his musical contributions, while Troy cited increased workload.  Sal, Eric, and Mars (discussing MMA) participated, adding to the overall chaos.  Josh, the auction winner, and Pia Lindstrom from Book Radio (whose show had a more prominent poster) also appeared.  Numerous commercial breaks for Steven Singer Jewelers (using the ironic website IHateStevenSinger.com) were interspersed.  Key moments included a debate over Kenny's musical contributions, a recounting of E-Rock's cinnamon challenge experience, and discussion of a Bobo song parody.  The informal and frequently interrupted nature of the segment reflected the show’s typical style.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  How do we explain the show? We should start there.  The Dopey and Agni show, their followers are violent extremists.  I would have ridden this cock off.  They use any derogatory term on the planet, but they can't argue or debate.  You're a waste of life, you fucking pig.  The Dopey and Agni show is a slut machine.  You have lovely giant breasts.  My nipples are kind of hard right now.  Fuck yeah.  They were like little lizards licking at their butts.  That's what they done.  It's fucking brilliant. 
[00:00:30]  The Dopey and Agni show, they breed violent extremists.  They call that humor for some reason.  Welcome to the program.  These people are not part of the human race.  These are anti-human.  Like you suck a tit to something.  That's what they're all about.  They're taking on the most vulnerable in society.  Chucky, ducky, fat, fat.  How dare you question the Dopey and Agni show?  Get used to it, man.  Let's go fucking have a good time, you know what I mean?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Ah, good morning, everybody.  Everybody.  You like the new intro?  That's pretty good.  We got that wacky guy.  The new fee.  Wacky guy.  I think that's the new fee guy.  Yeah.  Who is now obsessing about us and making more and more videos.  Those guys chewed me up pretty good.  Chewed me up pretty good.  He brought me up pretty good.  Did we play that one on the air yet?  I don't think so.  We should, maybe.  I kind of like him now.  And I'm sure after hearing another one, I'll hate him again.  Yeah, I kind of like him.  Well, because of the Chris Kyle story, he, I don't know. 
[00:01:30]  We were brought to his attention, I guess.  And now he's obsessing about us.  We just think he's, I don't know.  Silly.  Yeah.  Goose.  A silly goose.  Yeah.  So, uh, just want to bring up something.  Oh, boy.  We were having a couple of little chit chats before the show.  Yeah, Sam, I don't know what's wrong with you.  You got to turn those mics on as soon as me and Ann arrive.  Because you're missing all the good stuff.  You're missing all the good stuff. 
[00:02:00]  I sit down.  I look at Anthony.  And I go, well, I guess we're not going to the Super Bowl.  Right.  And I was thinking the same thing yesterday.  I was like, wait a minute.  What happened?  By the way, this is reason number 187 why I think.  Mark it down.  Gary and Rob are useless.  Because I know they sit there like, well, here's another reason why, sirs. 
[00:02:30]  You came to us months ago.  Months ago.  Hey, guys, would you like to go to the Super Bowl?  We do a broadcast from the Super Bowl.  And we're like, and this was before there was any inkling that the Giants would be in there.  Right.  And we're like, yeah.  Man, fuck yeah.  We'll go to the Super Bowl, do a broadcast stuff.  It's like, okay, okay.  A little jot down, jot, jot.  Jot it down, jot, jot, jot, jot, jot, jot, jot.  And then months go by.  Yeah.  We don't hear anything.  And actually, a little side note here.  Right when they said that, we went, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  We then started laughing hysterically.  Much to their chagrin.  And they got a little miffed.  And they're like, no, we're going to work on this.  We're going to work on it.  This is going to happen.  And we laughed because nothing ever happens here.  And then we walked down the hall whispering to each other, we're not going to the Super Bowl.  That'll never happen.  So fast forward.  What day is today?  January 24th?  Yes.  I guess I officially have to announce that we, the Opie and Anthony show, will not be at the Super Bowl.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we haven't heard a thing about it since.  Yeah, I don't think they're going to come to us with a couple weeks left and be like, hey, guys, guess what? 
[00:03:30]  Right.  We got the tickets.  We got the plane tickets.  Hotels.  You guys are going.  We've been doing radio for 17 and a half years.  I'm keeping track.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I am.  And we're not going to make it to 20, by the way.  Everyone's like, could you at least hang in there until the 20th anniversary of you guys?  No.  It's not going to happen.  I hate those even numbers.  Yeah, I don't give a fuck about even number anniversaries, okay?  We had a fucking great run.  We'll see how much longer we can go.  But how many? 
[00:04:00]  This is a quiz for Anthony.  Yeah.  And Jimmy, I guess.  It's so early for a quiz.  And Jimmy, who's, you know, he's only been around for 11 years at this point.  Oh, my God.  Maybe 12.  Virtual newcomer.  Yeah, you're still a newbie.  I'm still all eager and happy.  Look, guys, we're going to the game.  Yeah, no, we could still go.  Oh, there's time?  Yeah.  Every day, Jimmy walks in like, how about you add my name at this point?  No.  It's only been 11 years.  I know.  I'm very happy.  I do look at the logo and try to figure out how we could do it.  How about a whiff? 
[00:04:30]  I think Jimmy across our names from bottom to top would be great on an angle.  That would be good.  Right across our names.  And big red writing.  That I can accept.  I would like the Opie and Anthony show with Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  No, I just want Jim at that.  I like Opie's idea.  Just across it in like red.  Yeah.  Just splashed.  Jim!  Jim!  But yes, I'm still the eager new guy.  I'm like, I think we're going to the game, guys.  Who's that guy?  And is he going to kill us?  I don't know.  He's probably got a bomb belt on.  Are you going to kill us, sir? 
[00:05:00]  No, I don't think so.  All right.  All right.  Who is that?  He looks kind of normal.  He's the guy.  You're the guy?  He's the guy that won something.  Oh, congratulations.  That allows him to come in here and sit and watch this drivel for as long as he pleases.  Congratulations, man.  Thank you.  We're in the middle of a massive rant, man.  So sit back and enjoy.  Enjoy the show.  Let him get set up.  We'll talk to him in a little bit.  Yeah.  So here's the question for especially Anthony.  We've been together 17 and a half years.  Aw.  You're going to get me a Steven Singer gold coated Rhodes? 
[00:05:30]  He had a gold cockering at 20.  Steven probably sells him that douche.  I'm going to take one of my duties down to Steven Singer and he's going to gold plate that for you.  Gold plated.  A gold plated duty.  Steven right now is going, hmm.  Yeah.  Hmm.  17 and a half years.  Okay.  How many?  This is today's question.  How many Super Bowls have me and you gone to in 17 and a half years of radio?  And we've worked in some fucking markets where they know how to Super Bowl. 
[00:06:00]  I know.  All right.  Honestly, one.  Right.  One.  Oh, that's right.  We had to move a giant TV that someone won into their house and hang with their boring fucking family on Super Bowl Sunday.  Oh, that was wonderful.  Oh.  I'm, I, I kicked, I kicked myself in the, I kicked myself in the nuts that I, I was, uh, I was taken at that point. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, God.  Because I, I had some broads that I could have been banging at that Super Bowl party.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's true.  That was a good one.  They were cougarish, but, you know, I would have went there.  Fuck it.  I had a Super Bowl party that was going on that was my family's Super Bowl party, and those are fucking monstrosities.  They're great fucking Super Bowl parties.  And I couldn't go to my family's Super Bowl party because I had to sit in a house after we humped in what was a big screen TV of 10 fucking 12 years ago, whatever it was. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  You guys had to move the TV?  Yes.  We literally, because it was a thing, it's like, hey, ONA are going to bring your TV in.  Let's get some pictures for the website.  Why in 17 and a half years have we not gone to one Super Bowl?  Dump shows go.  Dump shows go to the Super Bowl every year.  Then we should have been tops on the list.  Just dumb radio shows go every year.  We can't go to the Super Bowl for some reason.  But this year, they go, hey, guys, you want to go to the Super Bowl? 
[00:07:30]  So we're like, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Watch this not happen.  Hey, now, guys, we're going to kick that upstairs.  We got some things we were going to move around, and we know, yeah, okay.  And here we are, Super Bowl a couple of weeks away.  We're not going.  Right.  But something tells me there are probably tickets to the Super Bowl.  Floating around the building.  I want to know if book radio is going to the Super Bowl.  That would be good.  I want to know, Sam, your job today.  It's not just the catch.  And you will not get in trouble because it's on the air. 
[00:08:00]  Sure.  I want a list of the shows at SiriusXM going to the Super Bowl.  And if the listeners could help us out, because they listen to other channels, I need to know  what channels are going to the Super Bowl this year.  Yeah.  Well, I can, so far, and this is just from this morning, so a lot of it is rumor and speculation.  Oh, I love rumor and speculation.  Me too, Anthony.  Especially about people's sexuality and health status.  Yes.  This year, the morning mashup will not be at the Super Bowl.  Oh, no.  What happened there? 
[00:08:30]  They're kind of Super Bowl down.  They've been to a few.  After year after year of going, it's got to get a little boring.  It would.  Rumor is strong that Kavino and Rich will be returning to the Super Bowl.  Ah.  What?  Rumor is strong.  Opie and Anthony Light.  Opie and Anthony Light are going to the Super Bowl again.  I'll confirm that in about 40 minutes, but rumor is strong.  Sam is a little weasel.  He's going around shoving his nose in his shit.  I also get that info.  There's another show. 
[00:09:00]  What show?  This is a rumor.  Sway.  Sway!  Sway just started here!  All right, Sway!  We've been on satellite seven and a half years.  Super Bowl, Sway.  He's been on satellite maybe four months.  The rumor is that Sway is the sort of...  Oh, fuck this place.  You know what I hear a rumor?  What?  I hear Sam Roberts shit show going to the Super Bowl.  That's right.  That's right.  That's exactly correct.  How insulting would that be?  They send the after show.  Sam, we got spies all over the place. 
[00:09:30]  Bill in Bumfuck, West Virginia.  It is a real town.  Covino and Rich are going to the Super Bowl.  All right.  Yeah.  So why the fuck are we not going to the Super Bowl?  I can't wait for that dopes answer today.  Oh, there's going to be a good one.  That stupid egghead.  What is he going to say today?  That's what it's going to be, too.  This very, I'm not sure of what is even coming out of my mouth shit is going to be.  Well, we weren't able to work out.  We tried this.  Oh, so it didn't work. 
[00:10:00]  Tell us the truth.  You didn't fucking...  No.  I guess Covino and Rich have better people behind them to push that whole thing.  If this Scott Greenstein can't even keep the fucking toilet seats clean, how are you expecting him to get a Super Bowl trip together for us?  He doesn't work in facilities.  What?  No facilities?  He doesn't work in facilities.  Well, how about he starts there?  That would be impressive.  Scrub the fucking toilet seats because there's that thick urine you can't get off the seats.  I hate that stuff.  It almost turns brown.  And then I have to pull one of those toilet panties out of its dispenser and sit on that. 
[00:10:30]  I don't want to sit on the toilet.  You don't like that little hospital gown for the bowl?  No!  Chicks do that, not guys.  They do.  Guys sit on bowls.  That's why you could always lick a chick's ass.  Huh?  That's why you could always lick a chick's ass.  They use that thing.  Yeah, they're nice and clean.  Yes.  So who else is going to the Super Bowl?  I'm hearing that, of course, Scott's going.  Of course he's going.  And of course a bunch of salespeople are going. 
[00:11:00]  And the excuse there is that they're doing business.  You don't do business at a Super Bowl.  I can confirm that salespeople are going to the Super Bowl.  For what reason?  For what reason?  What kind of business could they be doing?  For what reason?  No one does business at a Super Bowl.  No one just wants to talk to a boring satellite fucking radio sales rep at the fucking halftime?  No.  Right.  17, 13.  Look, we have an opportunity.  For what reason?  What reason?  Tell you about a package we have.  Multi-channel package.  You've got this massive platform and sales weasels are taking up spots where radio shows 
[00:11:30]  could be broadcast and live.  Yeah.  That's just stupid.  Why is that happening?  They got to, you know, they're the movers and the shakers of the company.  You're an asshole.  But why are they going?  Why are they going?  They got to be there to sort of hobnob with the clients.  Hobnob?  Everyone's just drunk.  It's all about forming.  It's a big party.  It's forming relationships.  There's no relationships that will be formed.  No.  But if you're a radio show and you got live mics, that's programming. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  There'll be a lot of celebrities there, too.  Of course there will.  So it'll be good for the radio show.  And good for one guy who loves hanging out with celebrities.  And I'm not talking about Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Oh.  Oh, because I was going to say I do.  Yeah.  So who else is going?  Right now, the names that I've heard are Kavino and Rich, Sway, and then a bunch of people  from the NFL channel and sports.  Those are the names that I've heard.  So what happened with us? 
[00:12:30]  What happened with us?  What happened that we were asked, we agreed, and they better not come and say, well, you  guys said no.  No, no, no.  We agreed and nothing happened.  You know what?  We didn't even ask.  No.  Because I just assume year after year we're not going to the Super Bowl.  We didn't even ask.  They came to us and asked us if we wanted to go and do a broadcast from the Super Bowl.  And I said, yes.  Yes, of course.  Oh, Jesus.  This is mind-boggling. 
[00:13:00]  And then they get all upset that we beat them up.  But you know, but it's time after time.  It just keeps happening and happening.  Right.  They ask.  They present us with things.  They, you know, somebody brings up like CES and things like that.  And we're like, yeah, of course.  Why would we go to Vegas?  Oh, and then that doesn't come to fruition.  It's just over the years, it's constant.  To keep it fair, the CES, they've downgraded that whole thing.  Oh, I know.  But, you know, before they downgraded.  Or is that the word, I guess? 
[00:13:30]  Or, you know, cut back, whatever the fuck it is.  Downsized.  Downsized is what I was looking for.  I'm sorry.  It's still early.  Yeah, they downsized big time.  It used to be a shitload of people went out there for CES every year.  Sam used to send us all over the place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He used to send us the poker tournament.  Right.  We'd do some trips for XM.  I think.  Yeah, poker tournament would be nice.  But we got sent to the Hard Rock in Times Square.  That's the only place we are allowed to go these days.  I think the takeover, not the merger, the massive takeover.  The hostile takeover. 
[00:14:00]  The hostile takeover by Sirius.  And extinction of XM Radio.  Was what, about four years ago?  Yeah.  How many trips have we been on since then?  Because before that, we went to L.A. twice.  At least twice.  Yeah.  Vegas three or four times.  Nolens.  Nolens.  At least once.  Many trips to Washington.  Camden.  Went to Camden.  Have we been on any trips since the hostile takeover? 
[00:14:30]  I don't think so.  I have.  During vacation.  Atter Banks.  Oh, the Atter Banks is nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've done trips.  Yeah.  Atlantis.  A couple of cruises.  Oh, you mean the company sends us?  Oh.  See?  No.  I don't even know what this is, so bear with me, because we're trying to find out the shows  that are going.  And I want to know how they got that done.  Jason, what's up?  Hey!  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh.  Start over.  Sorry.  Start over. 
[00:15:00]  Start over.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We didn't have a button push.  Start over, Jason.  What do you got?  You're on the air.  Okay.  Sorry.  Sorry, gentlemen.  We heard you.  There's a wrestling show I listen to in the afternoon on channel 208 called Busted Open.  And all last week, they kept saying how their hosts get to go to the Super Bowl.  And, you know, because pro wrestling at the Super Bowl is key.  Is this true?  I forgot about that.  There are extenuating circumstances.  Oh, okay.  What is that?  Which you can accept or not accept.  The hosts of Busted Open technically work for NFL radio. 
[00:15:30]  So they'll probably be there representing NFL radio.  And then they'll also, for whatever reason, be broadcasting the professional wrestling show from the Super Bowl.  Are you management now?  No, I'm just saying.  That sounds like an excuse.  Yeah, you might as well wear a tie.  That's the excuse.  That sounds like an excuse that we're going to hear.  That's what you'll hear.  If I was so inclined to stick around to hear, I would probably hear that.  But I will be in the elevator.  Wait.  There's a show called Busted Open, and they're going to the Super Bowl. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Gary, you suck.  That's true.  I forgot about that one.  You're just the worst.  Yeah.  What does he do?  What does he do if he's not trying to get us to go to the Super Bowl?  Well, you're at the Super Bowl.  You're going to get tired of talking about football, so you send the wrestling show.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something, brother.  Oh, God.  What is it about us?  People just don't want to be around us, I'm assuming.  Are we abrasive?  Do we rub people the wrong way? 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  Is that what's going on?  Could be.  I think we've got to start looking at ourselves at this point.  Maybe we should look inward.  I'm starting to think, if we can't get to one Super Bowl in 17 and a half years, we might  be the problem.  With multiple companies.  We might be the problem.  Let's turn our angry eyes inward.  I mean, with really, really soul-searching questions, like, do we rub people the wrong  way?  Oh, I just blew up the phone.  Yay!  No, it's not yay today.  Oh.  I'm taking less phone calls. 
[00:17:00]  You know that.  But where the fuck does the phones go?  I just like when things don't work around here.  Well, because these people are ratting out other radio shows.  I love it.  I fucking love it.  Oh, so somebody pulled the switch.  I don't know.  They ran for the phones.  Quick, pull the plug.  Do we have to start over?  No.  Oh, Mars.  All right.  Damn.  That's a nice phone screen.  I'm hearing Al Q and Cosmo Radio.  Are they going?  I don't know.  Al Q. 
[00:17:30]  Email bomber bosses.  Stop it.  That's so 1998.  Stop it.  Oh, man.  So now we sit, not going to the Super Bowl.  What time does Gary get his lazy ass in you so we can fucking find out why we're not going  to the Super Bowl?  Because certainly he's not here now.  He wasn't feeling well yesterday.  They all, these guys show up once every two weeks and pop their head in like, hi, I'm here  today.  Oh, good for you.  Now, how about you do it every fucking day for seven straight years? 
[00:18:00]  Then I'll be impressed.  What are other shows that have gone to the Super Bowl in the past and what have they done  there?  What memorable segment is there from their show?  I know the morning mashups, big thing.  I think last year they talked to the situation at the Super Bowl.  Wait, from the Jersey Shore.  All right.  What about, didn't the foxhole go?  Yep.  Jamie Fox was there with the foxhole. 
[00:18:30]  Got to go to the Super Bowl for Sirius XM satellite radio.  He didn't need them to go.  He's an Oscar winner.  That's okay.  And he doesn't even really do a radio show.  No.  He's one of those weird branding channels where the channel's named after somebody, but  that guy doesn't do any radio.  It's just, so he could be on that big cardboard thing at Best Buy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what happened there?  How you get attention around here is to actually not do radio shows.  It is the oddest little thing.  We're in kind of a weird spot.  We come in and do radio.  Right.  And that's, that's not good enough. 
[00:19:00]  What we have to do is no radio shows and then all of a sudden we'll be part of all the  marketing.  Right.  Oh.  What?  Oh, what is this?  There you go.  Oh, here's the big interview.  Oh.  This is from the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Last year?  Last year.  Last year's Super Bowl.  Oh, let's hear this.  Amazing radio.  Navigating, you know, many different variables, so to speak.  Okay.  And do, you know, through my universal travels, I know how to deal with that type of stuff.  Do his universal travels. 
[00:19:30]  No, no, no, no.  Come on now.  For real.  The next season is supposed to be in Italy.  How does it feel going back to your homeland, bro?  Going back to the homelands, you know, where my family name is from and Italy.  And I'm so excited to go down there.  I really don't speak a little bit.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Italy.  Italy.  Italian.  But you speak the language of love, so it'll be all right.  The situation is a universal language.  You know, it's just like, as soon as I walk in the room, it's like, situation. 
[00:20:00]  Capital S, iteration.  Board of this company, waste some plane tickets.  Holy fuck.  There wasn't a lot of football talk in that segment.  No.  Could have been done anywhere.  We wouldn't have wasted plane tickets.  We would have done some good fucking radio.  But that was the highlight.  All right.  And why would you send the Opie and Anthony show that's based in New York to a Super Bowl  where now you've got the Giants and the Patriots?  And the Patriots are playing.  And what are you going to do?  We became radio stars in Boston, too. 
[00:20:30]  There's a big fucking connection with this show and those two teams.  Those two cities, I should say.  Oh, what is this?  This is the big Jamie Foxx thing.  They got Adam Sandler to talk to Jamie Foxx at the Super Bowl.  Oh, well, let's hear some of that.  No, please get out of here.  I was talking to your producer.  Yeah, Jamie, I never would have made Ray Charles.  That's not my type of show.  I do the movies that make money.  Didn't you make some money off that one?  I think it went all right.  I didn't make some money off that one.  I think it went all right.  Unless we 300 mil. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah, that's his sick lifestyle.  He's got to pay for it.  He bets a lot of games, so he's got to get that money.  But this one's all right.  Adam Sandler sucks.  Aniston's great in it.  Brooklyn Decker and Nicole Kippen, they're all good.  I do my thing.  This can't be happening, man.  This isn't happening.  What are you doing, Nick?  You over in the corner?  I'm in the corner, dude.  I'm just staring at people, creeping everybody out.  Security.  I'm getting maced every day.  Pause this.  As a radio guy that's been doing this since I was 18 years old, what happened right there? 
[00:21:30]  Jamie Foxx went, holy shit, Adam Sandler is a dud.  He has nothing.  Let me see if Nick has anything to save this segment.  I was just informed of some good news.  You guys might be able to go to the Super Bowl.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, Mad Dog is actually giving away tickets.  Oh, so if we call?  If you call.  Oh, yeah.  He has tickets to give away.  Here's a question for Gary.  Especially Gary.  I'm going to start leaving Rob out of it because, yeah, Rob's...  He's so far down the totem pole. 
[00:22:00]  Well, he just extended his internship, I heard, so...  He's not an intern.  What?  He's not?  He's in middle management.  No.  Rob is like the guy that brought the wrong brain back during Frankenstein.  He's like, you can yell at him, but, you know, he doesn't know what to do.  What's it going to do?  I like him.  In another world, we probably would be friends, but, you know, sorry.  Oh, Gary?  Uh, no, no.  Gary's a weasel.  Can I ask this question, Sam? 
[00:22:30]  So we're not going to the Super Bowl?  No.  Obviously.  Unless you win the Mad Dog ticket.  But I'm sure we're going to be getting a pair of tickets marched down that hall any  moment so we can give them away on our show.  Because this is a massive radio show for Sirius XM.  Yeah, we should have ticket giveaways for the Super Bowl, right?  Yeah.  If Mad Dog has a pair of tickets, we certainly have to have a pair of tickets.  As sure as our pictures up in the lobby, we should have tickets.  Oh, wait.  Wasn't that happening, though?  That was happening, I think.  The proofs.  This week.  What?  It's what it's scheduled for. 
[00:23:00]  God, this place is now officially hilarious.  Hilarious.  Well, do you have any...  I don't know if we have any...  So we got Super Bowl tickets.  Because a show like ours, if we had a pair of Super Bowl tickets, my God, what we could  do with those.  I think we would get some media attention.  I really do.  Yeah.  This place talks to this show the way I talk to women.  It's like you just keep saying whatever...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever you have to say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just let me come in your face. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, like, we'll go out to eat, like, as you're guiding your cock in our mouth.  Like, hey, we'll have dinner, but just not tonight.  Not tonight.  Next week.  Next week.  So is the Egghead going to give us our Super Bowl tickets today?  Oh, my.  Sam?  I mean, we, in our staff meetings, haven't discussed any...  What do you do in the staff meetings?  Because now they'll blame you.  Well, this is what I'm here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're in trouble, by the way.  Sam, you're always in trouble.  I'm going to take you inside a little bit.  E-Rock, look down.  Oh, boy.  They're now going to blame the staff. 
[00:24:00]  They're going to talk to me and I'm like, you know, your staff should have brought up  the fact that you wanted to go to the Super Bowl and that you wanted Super Bowl tickets  to give away.  Because I'm not smart enough to think that that is something that should have just been done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No Super Bowl tickets.  Yeah.  And no Super Bowl experience for the Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton show.  No.  And you know who loses in this?  The listeners.  They sure do.  The listeners lose.  But that dope down the hall is bringing salespeople because they're going to what? 
[00:24:30]  Business.  Network?  Business?  Yeah.  Getting new clients.  At the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  They're not going to get new clients.  Oh.  That's what the hope is.  I'm sure they got big advertisers.  You know what you do?  Here you go.  Enjoy the Super Bowl.  A few of us are going to be down there in a tent.  Not a lot of us because, you know, we have a lot of our high-profile fucking radio shows  going down.  He's at the 50!  The 40!  The 30!  The 20!  This package we have now to offer you is really the best sales, really, really, business! 
[00:25:00]  That's funny.  You fucking assholes.  Did you say you wanted one pair of tickets to get away to the Super Bowl?  Oh, no.  That would be nice.  You just wanted one?  One pair would be...  I would accept one pair, Sam Roberts.  You don't want five?  Who's got five?  No, this whole place has got five pairs.  Who has five pairs?  Tune in to Mad Dog Unleashed for your chance to win one of five grand prize trips to Indianapolis, 
[00:25:30]  Indiana for Super Bowl XLVI.  Wait, five pairs?  It says win one of five grand prize trips to Indianapolis.  All right.  And trips?  Does that include airfare and everything?  Yeah.  All right, let me...  Holy fuck!  All right, let me...  Oh, my God.  That's a nice thing to give away.  That is a great prize.  Do we have those Steven Singer gift cards?  We have one left.  Oh, those are nice.  I will be...  I like those.  I will be billing the company because I'm about to consult. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Mad Dog has five trips to give away, right?  All expense paid?  Yeah, one of five grand prize trips to Indianapolis.  If he had three grand prize trips to give away, that would be the same as having five.  Wait, let me...  Two less.  Two less.  Oh, I thought you were doing a math problem for me.  Which you pass on to, I think, our show.  Uh-huh.  Or one for our show and one for another, what you think is a high-profile show, and then  everyone wins, and you spread it out a little bit. 
[00:26:30]  Well...  Like, to the people that listen to the Mad Dog, they're listening because, holy shit, all  expense trips to the Super Bowl, if you had three of those, that's pretty fucking amazing.  Maybe Covino and Rich won the contest.  Hey, that's true.  And that's why they get to go.  Yeah.  I have amazing ideas as to what we could do to give these...  A Super Bowl...  How about...  We get a bowl and put lemons in it, and the first person to guess how many lemons wins  the trip.  I like it.  They call it the Lemon Bowl Contest.  That's so bad. 
[00:27:00]  I think so.  It's horrible.  Mad Dog's doing Super Bowl trivia.  Oh, yeah?  For five trips.  Super Bowl trivia!  Holy fuck!  You give him three, and then you got two more that you can give to other shows!  Oh, my God.  Of course he should go.  Why is he dressed like that?  He's a sports guy.  Of course he should go.  Yeah.  Is that a Patriot?  Is he dressed like a Patriot?  Yeah, I guess that's what he's doing, though.  Either that...  I got a wig on and Patriot wear!  He's dressed like a Patriot or Newt Gingrich. 
[00:27:30]  I can't tell.  Yeah.  What is he doing?  I don't know.  Being wacky and going to the Super Bowl, apparently.  Yeah.  That big, firm handshake.  Fuck, yeah.  You know he's all cock.  When do we get answers, Sam?  And who's going to be brave enough to go down and ask for answers today?  I mean, my job is to do what you ask of me.  Nice.  You know, that's my gig.  I wouldn't think you would get answers yet.  I don't think there's any...  I could chat.  Maybe something's in the works, though. 
[00:28:00]  Maybe something's in the work.  I can't wait to hear this dumb excuse today.  Oh, it's going to be great.  There's always a spin.  There's never...  Well, I dropped the ball, guys.  No, no.  It's going to be...  Well...  I want to hear either, A, I dropped the ball, or B, Scott Greenstein doesn't think anything  of you guys.  Those are your two fucking answers.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  You don't have anything at this point. 
[00:28:30]  Unless he's talking about Super Bowl tickets.  Huh?  Maybe if he's talking about Super Bowl tickets, he's right.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  That's all we hear from this guy.  Guess what?  You haven't gotten anything.  All right.  So, there you go.  We were greeted with that.  The realization for the 17th year in a row, we're not going to the Super Bowl.  I do have tickets to give away on my Boneyard show.  Oh.  Super Bowl tickets.  All expense paid trip. 
[00:29:00]  What brought it on?  What reminded you?  Because I just walked in, and you guys were talking about the Super Bowl.  It just hit me.  Oh.  This stuff just hits me, Sam.  I got you.  I try to push most of it down at this point, but this is a biggie.  Are they now going to scramble to try to appease us with at least tickets to give away?  Do you think that's going to happen now?  Will there be a scramble?  And they'll make it sound like they were trying the whole time.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Probably.  It's like, just stop it.  I will send you to the Pro Bowl with personal little digital recorders. 
[00:29:30]  Don't insult me.  I'll fucking rip those fucking tickets up at this point.  You will.  I bet I know what excuse, by the way, we're going to hear for Mad Dog having five tickets.  Five pairs.  But three does the same job.  You get it?  They're going to say something like, um...  Dr. Gay.  Hi.  Dr. Gay.  They call him Dr. Gay.  I'm here to talk about the Super Bowl.  What do you know, Travis?  What do you know?  I'm just assuming that any tickets that have been promised to other places to give away 
[00:30:00]  have already been spoken for.  I think so.  That would be my assumption.  Two weeks out, I don't think they have a pair lying around, but they might have to go and  literally suck someone's cock to get tickets to try to make them look less stupid than they look.  I bet they say that the Super Bowl tickets are not from them.  Right.  They'll say, no, no, no, that was a sponsor.  That's what I was thinking.  Or they'll say it's from the NFL.  The NFL did that.  They wanted it on a sports show.  They wanted it on Chris's show.  They had a relationship. 
[00:30:30]  So who got them those tickets?  Who's the one that went in, talked, and why didn't we have those guys?  We don't have those guys.  I know.  I know.  We have Egghead and the fucking guy that extended his internship.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  And the one guy that I did respect, they made him the boss of 100 channels here.  So he's kind of worthless at this point.  Too busy putting on a suit with no tie.  His creepy, casual look.  That's where the company made their big mistake.  We actually did respect the guy, and then they gave him a massive promotion so he can't 
[00:31:00]  focus on the channel.  So he fucking hires Egghead and a music guy.  We have castrated people.  Yeah.  That walking around.  What were they called there in Rome?  Unix.  We have Unix.  We have Unix working for the show.  Unix!  Could you get a list of all the Super Bowl winners from 1994 to present day?  Because that's what we've been hoping to go since 94.  So I want a list of everybody that won the Super Bowl.  And we could do some Super Bowl trivia.  And I want to run down the list. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, this is going to help all the Mad Dog listeners.  95 is the Cowboys.  That's all I know.  Oh.  Last one they won.  Maybe they're just waiting until the Jets go.  Oh, boy.  Fucking go.  And people just don't believe that I'm rooting for the Patriots.  I'm absolutely rooting for the Patriots.  You're a crazy person.  And that's stupid because they're in the same division as the Jets.  I know all that stuff, but I'm going Patriots.  Wow.  Dallas.  Dallas.  Where are we going?  94?  Dallas.  Dallas didn't go 94.  They went 95. 
[00:32:00]  With the 90.  They went.  Just started with 94.  That's when me and Ann started doing radio together.  January 94.  January 94.  We had the Cowboys.  Now, run them down.  These are 17 Super Bowls we could have been to.  I want the winners of the 17 Super Bowls we did not go to.  Cowboys.  49ers.  Cowboys.  Packers.  Broncos.  Uh-uh-uh.  What happened?  Are those all the winners?  He's making a mistake.  Those aren't the winners.  Cowboys didn't win 96.  It says winning team. 
[00:32:30]  Wait.  Is winning team in blue?  It says winning team, losing team.  Winning team.  Is in blue?  Cowboys didn't win.  They won in 92, 93, and 95.  Let's see 96.  The Super Bowl was in 94.  Oh, you told me about the actual.  Okay.  January 96.  So Sam was right.  All right.  Start over.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  So you got.  All the poor Buffalo Bills.  That's their twice losing in a row to Dallas.  How about four times in a row?  Well, to Dallas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's four times in a row they lost. 
[00:33:00]  Giants, Washington, Dallas, and Dallas.  Wow.  That's got to fucking suck.  Holy shit.  No wonder they just off themselves up there.  And the beauty is I was living up there for all of those.  Rooting for the Bills?  The last one I moved home to start my BAB career.  Was it just like incredibly depressing up there?  Honestly, the whole city shut down.  I've never seen a whole place depressed at the same time.  It was unbelievable.  It was the third time the worst.  And it was a shitty winter.  It was horrible.  Everything in Buffalo, you're like, wow, this must have been really cool in 1986. 
[00:33:30]  Every building looks like it was done in 1986.  It was horrible.  Do you know that first Super Bowl?  They must have been like, yeah, like that.  And then it's like, oh, we lost.  Fuck, fuck.  And they're all mad.  The second one, it's like, yeah, chance of redemption.  Yeah, yeah.  Destiny.  And then they lose.  And it's like, oh, twice in a row.  Third time, they got to be like, we can't lose three times.  And then what?  They make it in again.  And the third time, they lost 52 to 17.  Oh, yeah.  That was a blowout. 
[00:34:00]  And it should have been 59 to 17 and broken the Super Bowl record.  But stupid Leon Lett on a recovery, on a fumble recovery, I believe, was fucking showboating.  And Don Beebe ran and knocked the ball out of his hand.  That was great.  That's that game.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Look at you.  You're channeling Mad Dog.  Look at you.  No, I have good memories for things that are utterly virtuous and worthless.  The Don Beebe-Leon Lett story has gotten me zero pussy since that year.  That will never help you, Kyle.  No. 
[00:34:30]  Let's do this.  I'll start with the 94 season.  So you got 49ers, Cowboys, Packers, Broncos, Broncos, Rams, Ravens, Patriots, Buccaneers,  Patriots, Patriots, Steelers, Colts, Giants, Steelers, Saints, Packers, and then...  Who did the Steelers beat a couple years ago?  All those fucking...  Seahawks.  All those games.  And we didn't go to one of them.  Nothing.  Not a one.  Opie, what was our...  We had 17 opportunities.  What game was our Take the TV to the Listener's House game? 
[00:35:00]  Do you remember the teams?  We were at N.E.W.?  Yeah.  So it's got to be...  So it's either 99, 2000...  Which would be 2000 Super Bowl.  No, no, no.  I don't remember that one.  No, because we started in 98 in New York.  So it would have been the 99 Super Bowl.  The 99...  Oh, I think it was the Broncos because we did the Bronco Bash, didn't we?  I thought you did that in Boston.  No, that was the Jets.  Or the...  Wait a minute.  We had two amazing Super Bowl promotions.  We fucking sledgehammered the Bronco in 99. 
[00:35:30]  That was 99.  So it had to be the Rams-Titans, I'm thinking.  Well, unless...  That's the game that ended on the one-yard line.  Oh, God, I don't know.  Fuck.  Because it's the best ending of any Super Bowl.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  The Broncos were there in 98 and 99.  Ended on the one.  Yeah.  I forgot about that one.  Titan one yard short.  Who's that Titan to do?  St. Louis.  Would that have tied it, though, or what?  Because there's weird points that that would have given...  That would have tied it.  What would that have done to gamblers? 
[00:36:00]  Because there was some...  It would have put the...  What am I talking about?  It would have done something with points.  Good points, shithead.  Cover the spread, man.  I can't believe I'm out of the Super Bowl with my sports knowledge.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That was...  All right.  Well...  Boo, Jim.  Jimmy.  Something about points?  That with points?  You were at a store with points?  Is this Rob?  Gentlemen, I'm happy to answer any questions. 
[00:36:30]  It's a fake Rob Cross.  No.  I want to deal with the...  Stop.  ...the real guys.  Have they even brought up the Super Bowl in the last month or two?  No.  It hasn't come up at any meetings.  Has it come up at any time since they asked us if we would do a broadcast from the Super  Bowl?  I think it's come up in a few sales meetings.  Yeah.  And we laughed, and they go, no, we really think we could get this done.  And they look like, oh, they're laughing at us again.  Again.  I can't believe these assholes.  No wonder we laugh.  Why do you think we laugh? 
[00:37:00]  It came up early on, though.  It was like, so the guys are willing to do a Super Bowl broadcast.  Yeah.  Of course.  But then once it got past that...  We've been willing for 17 years.  Once it got past that phase, it was...  17 years.  There was another thing we were asked if we were willing to do.  I love these willing.  Are you willing to fuck Scarlett Johansson?  Are you willing?  Well, yeah, I'm willing.  I don't know, but she squirts.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, see, we would have, but, you know, it was illegal to roofie her and rape her.  Oh, okay.  You have an excuse.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey. 
[00:37:30]  Joe?  Oh, I'm going to go out on a limb and say one of the reasons why Camino and Rich might  be going is that they don't call Scott Greenstein a lazy fucking egghead.  Well, no, he's not the egghead.  What's the matter with you?  No, no.  The egghead is one of the babysitters of our channel.  Greenstein, I guess.  I don't know, because I haven't even seen the guy in three months, runs the programming  department, and he's also in charge of making sure the toilet seats are nice and shiny and  clean every morning. 
[00:38:00]  And he's been slacking on that as well lately for some reason.  I'm glad you could appropriate the name calling and get everything straight.  Yeah, yeah.  And I just want to thank Anthony for a wonderful time at the compound.  Oh, yes.  Playing poker.  Nice.  It was a wonderful time, and I enjoyed knocking you the fuck out of your own tournament.  Yeah.  That was a bad one, you river and motherfucker.  Fucking rivers me.  River.  Bastard.  Can I tell you guys something?  Take it easy.  I'll see Otto later.  I'm Otto. 
[00:38:30]  You know, I know we don't want to hang out with management, certainly, but did we ever  go three hours without seeing Eric Logan?  Wow.  When he was our boss?  The real boss?  We only deal with real boss.  Greenstein.  I haven't seen him.  I remember it was before Thanksgiving was the last time.  Oh.  I'm looking at pictures from your Bronco match.  You don't want to get Florentine along with me?  No.  I saw Scott recently. 
[00:39:00]  I saw him at the Van Halen show.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yes.  Oh, at the Van Halen.  Wait, why was he there?  We didn't talk.  I was sitting there with Florentine and Roland and I.  Why wouldn't he talk to you?  Well, at least you can't.  I feel like you're probably easily top five most important people here.  Maybe in the room, but I wouldn't say the company.  No, I'm not even joking.  Well, then we said hi.  We said hi.  When celebrities come in here to do interviews, they normally know Jim Norton. 
[00:39:30]  Some do.  It has to be something to be said about your career and things.  So, well.  He just nodded at you.  No, we shook hands.  He said hi.  Trying to get a picture with David Lee Roth.  Not you either.  I have one.  I'm sure he was clamoring.  What does he do?  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  What do you got there, Sam?  I'm looking at pictures from the Bronco Bash in 99.  Yeah.  The car had spray painted on it the phrase, Elway Bites. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  We were so douchey.  Wait, can I see that?  Oh, no.  You've never seen these pictures?  And look at Opie's mean I have a sledgehammer face.  Oh, look at Anthony.  That Anthony looks so, like, I'm posing with a sledgehammer.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, wow.  When you guys tweet this, I'll retweet it.  Elway Bites.  That.  Travis.  Why not Sucks?  Did the station feel that was too mean?  Huh?  Probably.  Elway Sucks.  Why Bites?  Honestly, did we even spray paint this thing? 
[00:40:30]  I don't remember spray painting it.  It would have been the promotional, we didn't spray paint it.  I don't remember spray painting it.  It would have been the promotion department.  Right.  The promotion department.  Remember those things?  Remember a promotions department?  We have one.  Wow.  Really?  As much as I'm sure our listeners will make fun of this, I remember this being a really  fucking good day, man.  That was the, uh, over the hump for us right there.  That was a, uh, we kind of, uh, we're, uh, I remember that it was in Munaki.  Getting an audience.  Oh, it was in Munaki.  Is that where we met Pat? 
[00:41:00]  I don't know, but it's, uh, Pat's hometown.  Uh, the broadcast was in a nice sports bar up there.  Yeah.  Munaki.  And I remember having a really good time at this thing.  I want one.  The bit itself, probably a bit hacky.  It's been done a lot, but, uh, I remember having a really.  I bet those shirts are really good time.  Collectors items now.  They're actually shirts that say, I bashed a Bronco with Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I want one of those shirts.  Who was it?  O.J. has one.  He's a homeless wife.  Decapitated her.  Let me see all the pictures.  Did you go through all of them?  Yeah.  He went very fast.  Could you imagine right now, though, what we'd get? 
[00:41:30]  It would be like, well, you know, something could fly off the vehicle and injure one of  the participants, so we can't do that.  What we could do, though, is have a Bronco.  Right.  And people can write on it.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you could green screen it.  You could green screen the Bronco.  It's called Virtual Bronco Bash, because it's new and exciting.  That was my winter hat stage.  I was obsessed with wearing winter hats all the time. 
[00:42:00]  My God.  Can I see that picture?  Can you try that a little bit?  I was obsessed with it.  That is something, isn't it?  Why would you wear a winter hat inside?  I'm sure it was warm.  Oh, boy.  Well.  Those two gentlemen.  All right, well.  Where did they go?  Where did those two guys go?  Can I see more of these pictures?  Ah, they're 99.  Wow.  What happened to their souls?  Look, they had life in their eyes.  What happened?  They had hope and meaning in their eyes in that picture. 
[00:42:30]  What happened?  This business, which should be the easiest business in the world, just beat you down.  We work for a company that doesn't want to acknowledge us.  It's unbelievable to me at this point.  I'm trying to see a familiar face in the crowd, if there's someone that actually stuck around.  Yeah, I don't recognize anybody.  They're all standing on top of the vehicle.  Yeah, these people are, I don't know, you've got to add 13 years on to their ages. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Fuck.  You know how many of these fat shows are dead, Billy?  Oh, my goodness.  There's Ant, and there's O.L. right in front.  Yeah, yeah, we're right in front.  Hey, yay.  It was a good time.  That was.  Yeah, that was fun.  I'm not even going to have fun to go.  There was some cool events.  I found photos of, when did you guys do Hooters?  Maybe there was a thing.  We used to do a lot of Hooters.  Magazine signing.  Whenever we had something to sign, we'd always go over to Hooters.  Or just some days we'd go, look. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Meet us at Hooters after the show.  Yeah.  We hung out there a lot.  Because it was right downstairs.  Yep.  That was fun.  Nice and close.  Me and Voss.  Tits.  Steve C.  I remember that from the photos.  Oh, yeah.  It's like 2000.  All right.  Great.  What was that?  So, you're going to find out more about the Super Bowl?  Yeah.  I just confirmed the morning mashup is definitely not going.  Okay.  Just confirmed.  And Covino and Rich and Sway, another report saying they are. 
[00:44:00]  They are going.  Sway, who just started here.  Nothing against Sway.  He seems like a nice guy.  Sure.  We met him.  He seems cool as hell.  But he's been working here four months.  And he's a new employee.  I mean, he's a new employee.  Why would you send a new employee?  He actually started working here after the original pitch to go to the Super Bowl to you guys.  After you were asked, would you go to the Super Bowl?  Oh, boy.  When there was another morning show. 
[00:44:30]  So, stop asking yourself, why are they so mad?  All the answers are in front of your face.  How does he get to go?  Sway, what up, world?  What is it?  I actually don't know why.  Why?  Because they like him more than us.  Oh, okay.  At least that's not a cop-out answer.  It's real.  But we bring people to the fucking party, man.  Yeah, man.  You have to overlook that shit.  I want to know when the show Insignia, whatever you want to call it, is going up in the lobby. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, our big picture.  Yes.  Our big poster-y thing.  That was another.  It was on the way.  It was coming separately from the other ones, apparently.  Yeah, it was another hilarious excuse.  He actually turned it on us and said it was because we didn't want to do a new photo shoot.  And I'm like, there's a million fucking pictures out there.  That's a good idea.  Sam, could you please check to see if the pictures have been rotated?  Oh, okay.  Sure.  Could you run out and check that?  Well, you've got to run, though.  Because E-Rock, that happened when you were, E-Rock was being a bit gossipy in the restroom. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yes, he was.  Without checking the stall.  And somebody heard that they...  Which is a rookie move.  Yeah.  To this day, I don't understand why you would do that, but...  And that was, like, what, two weeks ago?  No, that was last week.  Oh, it was last week.  Yeah.  Okay, so maybe the time frame is still...  So, I mean...  Oh, I...  Their picture isn't there yet.  No?  Oh, I know.  But maybe it's still within the time.  Why does it take forever to get anything done?  Anything done, if it ever does get done.  Even dumb stuff. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Even dumb stuff.  Oh, my dear sweet Lord.  I was looking at a video yesterday of E-Rock, and I'm amazed, E-Rock, how thin you used  to be.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  And I'm not even taking a shot today, I swear to God.  He was a mere brontosaurus.  I'll explain in a second, but here comes Sam.  Ah, Sam.  Oh, he's laughing.  You just know from Sam's fucking laugh when he comes through the door.  Well, Sam, you've checked the pictures in the lobby, the very important six shows. 
[00:46:30]  They said that they would be rotating some of those pictures, and we'd be rotating it.  Is it a thing where...  How do they rotate them?  Do they have to, like, unscrew the thing and put a new poster in?  Or is it electronic?  No, it's a...  You actually have to slide out the photo and slide a new one in.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  It's like a big pain in the ass.  So that's not really rotating anything now, is it?  Well, the top row is Howard Stern, then Eminem, then Mad Dog.  Then the bottom row is Jay Thomas, Jason Ellis, and Book Radio. 
[00:47:00]  All right, so...  Book Radio.  This isn't exactly like the game Concentration.  I pretty much can say that nothing's moved.  No, that's the exact lineup from last time, when the excuse was that the posters are going  to be rotated.  Another bullshit excuse.  Book Radio is still up there.  They decided that Book Radio is way more important than us.  And the only reason we now have a poster that will go into some weird rotation is because 
[00:47:30]  we bitched and complained.  That's why we do bitch and complain, by the way.  Should have at least just moved the placement of the posters so it looked like...  Okay, look.  It was rotated.  Something.  We obviously should be...  Something.  You want to start listing shows that should be up there before Book Radio?  Okay.  Every show?  Yeah, there's really no show that shouldn't, except maybe Cinemagic.  Even that, you could put a picture of a movie.  That's true.  Be nice.  You could do the out cue for the gays.  You could do the fucking morning mashup for the pop... 
[00:48:00]  For the gays as well.  For the gays.  Certainly us.  Yes.  About Book Radio?  Covino and Rich, you could have anybody from...  Oh, wait, you got to have an M, but...  Anybody else?  Jay Thomas shouldn't be up there.  He hasn't done a good radio show in over a decade.  Who kid?  That guy is horrible.  He used to be a really good radio guy, but he sucks too.  Stinks.  No one's listening to that shit. 
[00:48:30]  That shit.  And then he has to be a fucking baby and take the guy, Ira, away from us?  Fuck Jay Thomas.  Clearing today, one beneath the sunny skies.  Remember that guy?  We're not allowed to have him on.  Even though we're one big happy company.  And our guys, we develop a lot of these weird characters that go everywhere.  We don't care.  But Jay Thomas wouldn't let Ira on our show anymore.  Even though Ira was having a good time.  Did we ever resolve that? 
[00:49:00]  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the resolution is no.  Yeah, is it?  Okay.  Yeah.  And Jay Thomas put some kind of fear of God in Ira's brain, because even when Ira sees  us, he runs away now.  I know.  He's so petrified.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Does he get paid?  So fuck Jay Thomas.  I was in the elevator once with Ira.  It was just me and him.  And between floors, he actually hit the stop button on the elevator and went, call the  police.  He's very upset with Jay. 
[00:49:30]  I don't understand.  Everybody around here is just weird.  They're weirdos.  It really is like being in an alternate reality where you know nothing's going to get done.  No.  And I know nothing is going to get done.  Yeah.  I understand that.  Yeah.  For whatever reason.  I mean, yeah, we're fucking assholes, but we also bring a lot of subscribers to the platform.  As assholes.  Yes.  And I would argue if you have our poster up in the lobby, that would help with guest  bookings. 
[00:50:00]  Because all the fucking huge publicists with massive guests sit in that goddamn lobby.  That's why this is important.  And they're just looking around.  Right.  It's a waiting room, basically.  Hey, what show do I want to get my guy on?  Well, no.  But if you're one of the highlighted shows on the poster wall, you're like, Opie and Anthony,  you know what?  My client hasn't really done their show yet.  Exactly.  That's what I was saying.  They look at those pictures.  It would absolutely help.  Yes.  Not with authors.  What?  Authors like book radio.  That's true.  They love it.  Stephen King's in that lobby.  He's going to go, I want to be on that channel. 
[00:50:30]  Radio.  That sounds like something I need to be on.  Are they going to the Super Bowl?  They're going to actually read More Than a Catch or whatever the fuck that book is?  Yes.  They're going to read it.  What did we say yesterday?  It was just a catch at this point.  Just a catch.  Oh, no.  Jimmy said More Than a Catch.  We had a question mark.  Yeah.  Will it be his follow-up book?  A catch?  Yeah.  They'll probably go.  God, I hope fucking Brady could get this fucking thing done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  You're the only Giants fan, and you just jumped on the bandwagon yesterday.  No, I'm not a Giants fan.  I know that, but I'm certainly not a Pats fan, and I'm going to have a Super Bowl party  because we won't be there.  Oh.  Yeah.  And I can't sit there and go, yay, Pats.  No way.  If you go to the Super Bowl, can I still watch it at your house?  There's no way.  Sure.  Travis?  Yeah.  It's over.  It's not going to happen?  Oh, believe me.  Just like everything else.  It's just over.  Oh.  I am totally banking on the fact that we are not going to the Super Bowl.  Can I go to your Super Bowl party? 
[00:51:30]  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Everyone's invited.  That's what I'm saying.  Opie, E-Rock.  Yay!  Fucking, uh, yeah.  Sway!  Sway!  The fucking book radio, bitch.  Uh, yeah.  Everyone's invited to the big Super Bowl party.  Gary?  Yes.  Yeah.  Gary is?  We'll fucking, like, beat him up.  Oh.  Wouldn't it be funny if Gary came to the Super Bowl party and he was just an abusive drunk?  Like, he, like, he had, and he had, like, fucking a half of a schlitz and started just 
[00:52:00]  motherfucking everybody.  Fuck you.  Fuck Opie.  Fuck your show.  And them fucking criminals in shade.  Fuck them.  Oh, fuck them.  He's just dropping N-bombs like it's the word the.  Yeah, he's fucking, like, he's shoving chips into his mouth.  What's that?  And getting his fingers wet.  Yeah.  And putting his hand back in the ball.  I've been more, uh, falling, I'm breaking shit in my house.  I was trying to pick it up.  Maybe if it was not so breakable. 
[00:52:30]  Big piss, big piss stain on his slacks.  He pisses himself.  Yeah, he fucking, he knocks something over in the fucking green screen room.  Thinks it's funny he throws a bottle into my TV when the team doesn't do well.  Yeah, he's like, put porn on.  I don't want to pretend that I'm grabbing for the cock.  Yeah.  There's, like, children there, and he's being all inappropriate, yelling fuck and cock and  cunt.  Filling racial epithets in every penalty.  Dry humping female members of my family. 
[00:53:00]  I can't believe Anthony fell out of this.  Oh, man.  I wouldn't blame him.  Oh, would that be hilarious?  I wouldn't blame him.  Oh, that would be so fucking funny, man.  You know what we gotta do?  Kiss.  We gotta go in the boss's office and steal some tickets.  You know what?  Let's go old school.  Why don't we go?  Let's go old school.  Great idea.  Where's that video?  I could pick a lock.  Video might be on my YouTube channel from the old days. 
[00:53:30]  I think I put that up there.  Let's steal tickets.  Let's go old school, Ant.  You know we've done it once before.  We could do it again.  You can't steal them.  It's too late.  I have them.  I'm a Super Bowl fugitive.  And I'm awake as a dog here.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that.  Just write...  No, not just write...  I'll just put Real Rock TV and then Opie Radio on my YouTube channel.  God, this is so bad. 
[00:54:00]  Just Google OOF.  OOF.  Google OOF.  Go down.  Go down, maybe.  Keep going down.  Keep going down.  Keep going.  Plus.  Oh, no.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Yeah, no, you got it.  Where's that?  That one?  Oh, no, no.  That's me watching it.  Ah.  I actually made a video of me watching the video we're about to play.  How chilly it was, yes.  And just beating the shit out of myself. 
[00:54:30]  How awful it was.  No, we don't want this version, though.  Maybe that'll get to the other one?  No.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  I know it's up there somewhere.  Can't you just get to it?  Come on.  What are you doing?  Stop fumbling.  Oh, Sam.  He's trying to find it that way.  Where's the original video?  Maybe.  It's not up there.  I think it's up there somewhere.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:55:00]  No, I'll just put it for you.  Sam, I don't want to get up to me.  Isn't it real R-E-A-L?  Maybe that's the problem.  Or was it R-E-E-L?  I thought it was real rock, like R-E-A-L.  How about just putting rock?  There's an irony there.  Oh, Sam.  Can you just YouTube Opie Anthony Aerosmith and it'll pop up?  No.  No, man.  How about Opie Anthony tickets?  It's that video where I watch it, but I don't know what the original is.  He just did it.  Dr. Gay just did it on his phone. 
[00:55:30]  Travis just did it on his phone.  He did too?  Dr. Gay did it?  What, real rock?  No, Opie Anthony Aerosmith.  Opie Anthony Aerosmith, what's the matter with you?  Oh, boy.  Let's see if this works.  Here we go.  All right.  Not Anthony.  Oh, my God.  What did he spell Aerosmith?  Of course he did.  Oh, my God.  He's panicking.  Guns.  Oh, God.  What happened?  Stop looking exasperated.  Then ONA risked their jobs by breaking into the process.  Oh, no.  What?  Is this it?  This is not good.  I love the walk across the street. 
[00:56:00]  Nice joke there.  Oh, blowing that light.  That's right.  No, no, no.  I can't do this.  That's right.  Why are you not going to do this?  No, no, no.  Is it?  Is this it?  Yeah.  That's what the description says, yeah.  Let's start over.  All right, sure.  By the way, I initially had the Sam Roberts.  I just want to say that.  Yes, you did.  Opie's doing the best walk across the street.  All right.  Well, can I set up the clip?  Jay.  Got to make believe I'm on Jay Leno.  Because now we have to just make believe shit because nothing happens anymore. 
[00:56:30]  We suck.  Last we left you, Opie and Anthony blew a red light.  And of course, everyone knows that means jail time.  Yeah, for some reason, that means jail.  So now Anthony is waiting for me with a microphone.  Yeah.  As I get out of jail.  What is that about?  Across the street.  I don't know what that was.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Well, here comes Mr. Funny Man.  Nice joke there, Opie.  Blowing that light.  Good job. 
[00:57:00]  There's another installment to Real Rock TV.  Hope you enjoyed it.  Here comes our favorite felon, Opie.  What happened?  Pause, pause, pause.  Did you get the full body cavity surge?  Jimmy is making fucking faces.  I can't just love him.  He should be making faces.  It was the two-fisted, the weird thing when you were walking?  Oh, you were doing a little walk?  Like a weird walk across the street?  No, that was my, like, drats.  Like, oh, I can't believe this happened.  Oh.  And, uh...  And, uh...  And, uh, of course, Jimmy has to pick up on it.  Your hat, uh, is sticking up so high. 
[00:57:30]  I told you.  What's wrong?  There's a gnome crossing the street.  I told you.  I was obsessed with wearing winter hats for a while there.  I don't even know why.  It's stupid.  Let's see the arms again.  What happened, dude?  Did you get the full body cavity surge?  Here comes our favorite felon, Opie.  What happened, dude?  Did you get the full...  There's another installment to Real Rock TV.  Hope you enjoyed it.  You're all angry walking across the street.  Like, oh, I thought I was going to get away with that. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, this is so bad.  Here comes our favorite felon, Opie.  What happened, dude?  Did you get the full body cavity surge?  They bend over.  How was it?  Thanks for the bail money, but now how are we going to get home?  They got our car.  They impounded the vehicle.  I have a mic.  I can't watch this.  Why would they impound the vehicle?  Jimmy, have fun with this.  I'm going to enjoy it.  Like, I don't get this bit.  Why are you across the street?  Yeah.  And why is my winter hat two feet up in the air?  And if they impounded the vehicle, and I just was there waiting for... 
[00:58:30]  What is that mic attached to?  Yeah, exactly.  Who's holding the camera?  What are you plugged into?  Why are we famous?  Why are we famous?  This is so bad.  Who the fuck saw this and said, yeah, we need these guys to do radio for us?  I guess everything else was even worse.  That's because no one had phones yet.  If we were doing this when people had phones, we would be fucked.  Goose would be cooked.  Right.  They had no choice.  They had to listen to this shit.  By the way, I love whoever picked out this location. 
[00:59:00]  It's literally the worst backdrop for a shot ever.  There's a giant brick wall about 50 feet high with scaffolding around it.  That was stupid Ian who was obsessed with me.  Oh.  And he might have, you know.  Yeah, but that's really like rugged and rock and roll.  That is pretty fucking alt.  Alt rock right there.  I think he's just standing in front of an abandoned fucking lot.  I don't know.  That's nice.  Terrible.  Right.  I guess we hitch.  Oh, he's hitching.  Hey, see you next Saturday, man.  What about the microphone with the wire? 
[00:59:30]  Pause.  Pause.  Pause.  Yeah, because Oak just puts his thumb right out and Ant walks over with the mic.  He's getting looped because the fucking cord's too long.  The cord falls out of the bottom is what happened.  Oh, is that what it was?  Yeah.  Hey, did the cameraman get a ride too when we hitched?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Whatever you were plugged into.  Whatever generator.  Yeah.  Generator.  Were you just holding the plug?  Yeah, this was before wireless microphones worked properly.  Oh, wow.  And now we're in studio. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  I hope he's got a winter hat on.  In studio.  Apparently the window's open.  I was obsessed with this shit.  In studio.  I got something.  We're going to put our jobs on the line.  Remember the but phase?  Yeah, I worked on it.  You really said it there.  I worked on it.  I got rid of that shit.  I got rid of that crutch.  Yeah.  Burn him!  Oh, I got something.  We're going to put our jobs on the line.  That's all I'm going to say.  We got something planned.  That's all.  That's all. 
[01:00:30]  That's all I can say.  I got to go.  It's okay.  You were in a hurry.  I remember that.  That was funny.  Why was that funny?  You were in a hurry.  You were like, I got to go.  And you hit the mic and you ran out of the studio.  Well, that was for the radio-wise.  I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But on TV, you just look like a dick.  Yeah.  But radio-wise, it makes sense to make it sound like this havoc and craziness going on.  This is fucking crazy.  I don't like watching this. 
[01:01:00]  And I put these up on my YouTube channel.  I don't even know why I would do that.  And I got at least another 10 I could put up there.  Wow.  I just had to stop because I couldn't.  It was too uncomfortable.  Don't film this, man.  We're stealing the new Aerosmiths.  They're in a hallway.  Oh, God.  With the ever-present winter hat.  And I'll be saying, don't film this. 
[01:01:30]  And the camera, of course, naughtily pans over.  To a ladder going up to the ceiling and someone's legs are disappearing.  You say don't film this, yet you completely confess to what we're doing on the camera.  Not we're fixing the light.  Hey, don't film this.  We're stealing tickets.  Why, if you're going to try to do this heck bit, why wouldn't you just do the bit and not acknowledge the camera?  Right.  And the camera was stationary when you looked at it surprisingly, meaning he was just standing there filming. 
[01:02:00]  It's not like you saw him running up to you at the camera.  All right, Sam.  How about you bring in your fucking tapes?  I did.  These are his tapes.  And there's Anthony in the ceiling.  Yes.  I was hoping that was a wood chipper you were getting into.  It's on a ladder trying to get over the doorway.  That's the one fucking Real Rock TV I cannot find.  And it's the douchiest one yet.  Which one?  Is it douchier than this one?  When we put Elmo through the fucking wood chipper.  Oh, right.  But we had a whole scenario where we're talking to the damn thing and you're making believe you're doing a drive-by. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, God.  Remember that?  I can't fucking find it.  That was horrible.  Good.  That would be so embarrassing.  I won up there on the channel because it's so bad.  And then it ends with us throwing him in a wood chipper.  Yeah.  And Bruce Mittman at the time thought it was the most amazing fucking piece of TV.  Boys, this is what I call entertainment.  And trust me, it wasn't even close to amazing.  Let's go back a little so we could hear Obi yelling at the cameraman and confessing the crime right to him. 
[01:03:00]  Don't film this, man.  We're still in the new Aerosmith stuff, man.  This is great.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I can't believe we ever did this.  I want to see how that first take went and then the director came in and said, cut, cut, cut.  Say man twice.  I told you.  The man, the dude, the brother man, the bro, the mother, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That was all because I was an old dude trying to talk to youngsters.  And I knew that in the back of my head.  So like, hey, at every chance, try to sound younger than you are. 
[01:03:30]  We had to dude it up.  Someone just wrote, gnarly scars, man.  Yeah.  Whoopty.  Very funny.  But Anthony would always blow it and say something old like, hey, there's some hot chicks.  Let's grab a Pabst blue ribbon.  23 skidoo.  I'm out of here.  Peele, that's a good drinking beer.  What?  How old are you?  Yeah.  Oh, well.  All I got to do is push down the knob and we're in. 
[01:04:00]  There you go.  Well, Ant, you know, because he used to work in construction.  I knew how to, yeah.  To go through the duct work and up over the false ceiling, I guess.  Yeah, I went over the drop ceiling and took a big stick and just pushed down on the lock  and I was able to open the door.  Legitimately.  But, you know, that was the only real part of this whole thing.  I hate to be a spoiler. 
[01:04:30]  But I do like the fact that you both adjusted to the camera.  You're very comfortable.  Now Opie's like going on to the camera like, oh, we're in.  Meanwhile, you were saying don't film this.  What happened?  I don't know.  Did you work out an agreement?  I'd like to make believe I don't know this person.  If you could go back in time and saw him filming this and you could be the director.  All right, hold it.  Don't even move.  What am I wearing on my feet?  Felas.  Oh, God. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, man.  Those are felas.  Felas.  God damn.  Wow.  They're walking in the office.  Dave Dickinson's office.  All right.  You know exactly where they are?  Oh, it's not even ticket.  It's the new song.  Let's go.  Let's go play it.  Pause.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, you were taking the new song to play it on the air? 
[01:05:30]  Yep.  Oh, that's how stuff gets funny.  Now, Opie's going, no, no, no.  I don't know what's next.  But obviously, Opie knows this is really bad.  No, I want to hear it because there's a man in an elf hat and another man looking under the brim of his hat.  I have to know what's happening.  You stole a disc.  Well, yes.  Yeah, we stole the...  Back in the day, it was very important what radio station got to play the new song first.  First was...  That was key.  So we were competing against WBCN at the time. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  So we were going to play it before.  So this whole bit is basically bragging that we're going to play it before them.  Right.  Because we had an end with Aerosmith for some reason because they were using us to help them restart their career, if you remember.  Yeah.  This is a true story, by the way.  We were so fucking hot in Boston that management...  Oh, how?  Their management came to us and said, look, you want the entire fucking band on your show.  You know, we want to tap into what's going on with you guys.  Did you have them on?  Yes.  Oh, wow. 
[01:06:30]  Fuck yeah.  Steven Tyler hung for over an hour just playing songs and stuff, and the rest of the guys that barely remember being there because he's the big get, you know?  Oh, boy.  But this is a true story.  And because of that, we were able to get the single before anybody else, which back in the day was very important.  But, Opie, we stole it.  But here's the problem.  Yeah.  We're now in the production room, so we're not even on the air because we had to find a place to film this.  Oh, like we were on the air.  And we had to make believe we were on the air, but if... 
[01:07:00]  There's no mics.  There's no mics.  There's nothing.  There were in headphones.  Big reel-to-reel behind us.  Right, right.  Why couldn't you just go in the studio and pop it in?  It was a disc.  There was obviously a show going on.  Oh, okay.  It was an awful disc, too.  It was like one of those homemade discs.  It didn't even look like something from a record studio.  Back then.  Yeah.  So, oh, God.  And then, oh, God.  What happened?  And then, this is going to involve puppets.  What?  That's why I can't look.  Why?  But I want to see the puppets.  I think Ant made the puppet. 
[01:07:30]  I love puppets.  Because, see, now we have to rub it into BCN.  Watch how we fucking rub it into BCN.  Oh, my God.  I don't remember this.  I must have been intoxicated.  You don't remember this?  No.  Yes, he's talking about the decade.  You still think we're at BAB, don't you?  I know.  I'm like, wait a minute.  What?  Oh, no.  Back up.  Because this is so douchey.  One thing I did like about these days, I was never without booze shirts.  Yeah.  Boy, did I have a wardrobe of booze shirts second to none. 
[01:08:00]  And wore them every ding-dong day.  Hit it.  All right.  Ant, we could get in trouble for this, but here you have it, guys.  No, we can't.  Put up and shut up.  New Aerosmith.  Mm-hmm.  We're going to play it on Real Rock TV.  Uh-oh.  We could get screwed for this.  An excellent audition.  What?  How am I doing?  What, did you forget your lines and just rip it off his card? 
[01:08:30]  We could get screwed for this.  If he didn't know any better, you would think Ant did that on purpose.  Yeah.  But unfortunately, today I have to say no.  I don't think we did.  Uh-oh.  We could get in trouble for this.  Uh-oh.  We could get screwed for this.  And your head is tilted weird.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Go back again.  Uh-oh.  He's drunk.  Yeah, it probably was.  It's afternoons, you know.  We probably knew it was just a dumb bit.  Real Rock TV.  Uh-oh.  We could get screwed for this.  No, I am being, I fucking, I would say, I swear I would say, I am being very, very sarcastic 
[01:09:00]  right there.  There was something about this that just came off like, fuck.  You sure, though?  I'm positive.  You sure?  Look at me.  It does seem passive aggressive.  I'm like, uh-oh.  We could get screwed for this.  I swear, I, I, there was something about this.  See, I have no excuses.  Are you saying today, sir, that you have an excuse?  At least I got plausible deniability here.  What do you really think?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know, but looking at it and knowing that's me, uh, I look like I'm being 
[01:09:30]  very sarcastic.  I could pull that line off.  I know I could.  That just looked bad.  Well, maybe, maybe they were just, they told you we're just going to run through it real  quick, and they kept the rehearsal.  Maybe they should just read the lines.  There was no rehearsal.  There was, we, we just rolled and went with it.  Let's see what happens here.  So now we're going to get in trouble for playing the new Aerosmith.  Yeah.  We got the volume cranked, too.  Check it out. 
[01:10:00]  What happened?  That's the end of the tape.  That's the end of the clip.  Too bad.  Because then the song plays, and I remember we, uh, I think we made a puppet of Oedipus.  Oh, no.  And he was wearing a BCN shirt, and then, like.  Did you make much smaller puppets around it?  Thailand puppets?  Then we were kicking it like this with our finger, making believe our finger was a foot.  We're crazy.  We were kicking the puppet.  You know why we didn't upload that to YouTube?  Because of the song.  Because they would have killed the audio on the whole video. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, right, yeah.  Probably.  Mm, right, right.  YouTube seems to have problems.  What was the song, by the way?  Uh, Put Up or Shut Up.  Was it?  I think.  Oh, look at us.  Is it a good song?  I don't remember it.  I don't care.  Did they have a song called Put Up or Shut Up?  I don't know if you guys meant that for yourselves.  I know.  Like, Put Up or Shut Up, we said we'd do it, and now we're doing it.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think maybe that was the song they were working at the time.  Sex?  Nothing?  Yeah.  Sex?  Yeah! 
[01:11:00]  I was watching a sexy video yesterday.  I do want to get to that.  Shut Up and Dance?  No, it wasn't that.  I think you said Put Up and Shut Up.  Or Shut Up.  Put it, like, about yourselves.  Like, you know, hey, we gotta put up and shut up.  Yeah, I know, but I think we were trying to be cool and, like, work in that song title to our dumb bit.  Oh, no.  No?  Was it pink?  That was a good, was it called pink?  No, that was weird.  Like the bing on your cherry.  Oof.  Yeah, that's bad.  Wow. 
[01:11:30]  That is bad.  You didn't like that one?  No.  All right, line.  Pink, like the bing on your, that's how it went, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You rock?  He had a bunch of examples of what was pink.  Like the inside of my asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember, I remember hating it.  Oh, jeez, thanks.  Yeah.  I like something of Lucinda Williams fucking tune.  I love Lucinda Williams.  Yeah, me too.  I'm embarrassed to say that, but fuck it.  I'll say that.  I like one song. 
[01:12:00]  There's a few good ones.  So underrated, that boy.  Can't let go, it's very good.  How do you know Lucinda Williams?  That means you went out?  No, the guy who was in here promoting, remember the Trucker Channel or whatever?  The way that guy.  Oh.  Yeah, it might have been it.  I went out with a girl there for a little bit, and she loved Lucinda Williams, and so  did I.  She turned me on to Lucinda Williams.  Yeah, she's good.  Uh-oh.  Turn this up.  Because pink is the love you discover. 
[01:12:30]  Pink has the ring on your cherry.  Ah!  Yuck.  Pink, because you are so very.  Mary.  Pink, it's the colour of passion.  Uh-oh.  Because the day, it just goes with our fashion.  Pink, it was love at first sight. 
[01:13:00]  Speaking of Steven Tyler, I thought about the National Anthem a little more the last  couple of days.  It sounded just like Steven Tyler.  I think the mainstream media is out of touch.  I don't think they know what Steven Tyler sounds like.  Yeah.  So they were just like, wow, he's screaming.  It's like, no, that's what he does.  Obviously, we learned that it's a tough spot for him without his band.  But that's Steven Tyler.  His voice hasn't really lost much at all.  Yeah, it's a little more gritty.  But they're obsessing about it, and they're playing it to death, saying, you know, what 
[01:13:30]  happened to Steven Tyler?  No, that's him.  You throw the guitars and shit behind him, and that's...  Yeah, it's rockin'.  And that's him.  Let's play some Lucinda Williams going into break.  Ooh, food.  Can we play...  We gotta play a really popular song, though.  Can't Let Go is great.  That's the one I got turned on to and liked her.  Really?  Is that a newer song?  Um, I don't know.  I like her so much, I can't even think of one of her songs right now. 
[01:14:00]  Just see if...  Let me see.  This is written by my friend Randy Weeks.  You're a lesbian?  No, that's a bad version.  Yeah, get the studio version.  Sam!  Boo!  Sam!  Boo!  Sam!  Sam!  Yeah, fuck it, let's go with this.  Can't let go of this, Cindy Williams.  Yeah.  You told me, baby, one more time, don't make me sit all alone and cry while it's over. 
[01:14:30]  I know it, but I can't let go.  Unlike a fish out of water, a cat in a tree, you don't ever want to talk to me.  Well, it's over.  I know it, but I can't let go. 
[01:15:00]  He won't take me back when I come around.  Says he's sorry, then he puts me out.  I got a big chain around the neck and I'm broken down like a train wreck.  Well, it's over.  I know it, but I can't let go.  See, I got a can when I burn so bright in my window.  If an hour was over, I know it, but I can't let go.  You don't like to see me standing around.  Feel like I've been shot to fall down. 
[01:15:30]  Well, it's over.  I know it, but I can't let go.  He won't take me back when I come around.  Says he's sorry, then he puts me out.  I got a big chain around my neck and I'm broken down like a train wreck.  Well, it's over.  I know it, but I can't let go.  I know it, but it's over.  I know it, but I'm about to piss you off. 
[01:16:00]  I'm not going to try it.  I know it, but there's a fine thing.  I know it, but it will be good.  There it goes, I know it, but I'm not going to say it.  We'll be right back. 
[01:16:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:17:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:17:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:18:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:18:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option.  I tried Cialis.  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction, contact your physician to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist. 
[01:19:00]  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big thrill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing.  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction height.  Fuck all the bullshit.  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  Uh, marriage is, I know bumpy. 
[01:19:30]  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like, it's a business, it's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is rich, and the other person is spelling all the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie.  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it.  Is he an affectionate guy?  He, no.  Is he bad with like casual, loving, touching?  Well, because I know he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that doesn't, like hasn't figured out how to caress. 
[01:20:00]  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter her fragile ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face.  Wow, Rich!  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie, and rest a little easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted. 
[01:20:30]  And then he gets mad.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  I've seen that a whole thing.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  And now he's coming over here, slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul talks about his career as a foley artist. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I did foley work.  Sure.  Like you take your hand and you put her L on it, and that sounds like the baby's bottom getting kissed.  How do you make the sounds of skiing?  You just blow into his hiney.  Whoosh!  Whoosh!  Yeah, you yank his little privates, and when his feet are kicking your chest, you tug his private parts.  That sounds like the tribal drums.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring. 
[01:21:30]  Uncle Paul.  And now he's coming over here, slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Hey, this is Bret Michaels of Poison.  Hey, this is Danny McBride.  This is Jesse Ventura.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  Hey, this is Michael Chiklis.  Hey, this is Hailey Herman.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  Hey, this is Steve-O, and you're listening to the Opie and Andy Show.  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I?  Alright, Opie and Anthony Show? 
[01:22:00]  Hey, this is Steve-O, and you're listening to the Opie and Andy Show. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, this is Steve-O, and I think you're listening to the Opie and Andy Show.  Getting topical.  Hold up!  Wait a minute!  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Getting topical, huh? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Jane's Addiction?  Yeah.  Someone's birthday from Jane's Addiction?  No.  No.  Man, you're getting too obscure with this shit.  Let's see.  I know like three or four Jane's Addiction songs.  I know.  I don't know this one.  And I don't know this one.  What's the name of this song?  If I gave it to you, it would give away what's going on here. 
[01:23:30]  But if I knew the name, then I would know.  Is it a song called He Sits in the Booth, Yet He Gets Fatter?  Really?  I apologize.  I apologize.  Really?  Really?  Oh, okay.  This is called...  I know exactly what this is.  I won't give it away.  Uh-huh.  Happy birthday, Neal Diamond?  No.  No, it's actually Yakov Smirnoff.  What? 
[01:24:00]  Right there.  Yakov Smirnoff's birthday.  Is this a song called You're Not Going to the Big Game?  Oh, it gets better.  Sam's laughing.  Huh?  Is there more?  Oh, yeah.  Ernest Borgnine is still alive?  He's still alive.  He's 95 years old.  Is that what you're getting sexy about?  No.  Can we play the Ernest Borgnine clip where he brags that he still jerks off?  Love that clip.  Let me see if I have that. 
[01:24:30]  What's the name of this Jane's Addiction song?  This song is called Nothing's Shocking.  Oh, Nothing's Shocking, right?  No.  Oh.  No?  That's the album.  Oh.  Ah.  Oh, the song is...  See, I thought I had it right there.  See, I still have problems with E-Rock's getting topical.  Yeah.  Because now he's playing a relatively obscure song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is this song called?  This song is called Ted Just Admit It. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  Ted Just Admit It.  Okay.  Well, it's the same.  And the album title does kind of fit in, too.  Oh, my God.  This is so obscure.  It is.  Well, you want it different.  Ted Bundy was put to death in Florida's electric chair 23 years ago.  So, let's play a Jane's Addiction song.  Right.  That no one knows.  It's called Ted Just Admit It.  But no one knows the song.  I know.  Yeah.  You can't take songs no one knows, E-Rock.  Do you feel like you're in a no-win situation? 
[01:25:30]  We're working with him, though.  Now he's going the other way.  He's too obscure.  The obscure thing is good, but you need a song that people actually know.  No one knows this song.  Well, you're getting the Jane's Addiction people mad.  But besides them, no one really knows this song, right?  True.  No, this wasn't a hit for them.  Getting topical with B-sides.  We're getting all kinds of...  With rare tracks.  Getting obscure with the sex men. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Deep tracks with sex bagels.  Deep tracks.  What an awful channel that is, too.  It's worthless.  How about you play something I know?  I know it's called deep tracks, but never mind.  I'm not going to go with that bit.  It's stupid.  Well, he was too obvious.  Now he's too obscure.  Or like E-Rock, you've got to go in the middle there somewhere.  I don't even mind the subject matter.  That's good.  The whole Ted Bundy thing.  But it's got to be a song that people know.  Maybe like the Married with Children theme, and then you could say they were the Bundys, 
[01:26:30]  and then Ted Bundy guy.  Could put Shock the Monkey.  Yeah.  Played Shock the Monkey.  Yeah.  That would have worked, right?  I think so.  And then we could have been like, Shock.  Something about a shock.  Did someone go to the electric chair?  And we'd be like, oh, we're working it out.  We're working it out.  How about Electric Boogaloo?  Electric Boogaloo.  Go with Electric Boogaloo.  All right.  What were you going to say before?  Which one, Sam?  You said it gets better.  I like when things get better. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, boy.  You are just an instigating motherfucker, Sam.  This is why I like Sam a lot.  So when you beat up Sam on my Twitter, I just block you, because the reality is we're pals.  And this is one reason.  He knows what buttons to push in me that I want pushed.  Oh, that sounds...  Hey, hey, Joan!  Oh, Joan and...  Joan Rivers.  Is that Joan?  Yeah, yeah.  Joan and Melissa just walked by.  Yeah.  Joan and Melissa. 
[01:27:30]  They probably go to OutQ to talk to the guys, because they're gay.  Yeah.  So that's why I like Sam.  We have a contest winner in studio today.  Yes, we do.  What's his name?  John?  Josh.  Josh.  Josh?  And I knew it was him.  Something with a J.  And he walked down, like, you look at your comedian, Josh, I know.  Oh, by the way, yeah?  Oh, really?  John Cogan, yeah.  Going backwards.  Go backwards. 
[01:28:00]  Ride the Lightning.  Ride the Lightning.  Ride the Lightning.  Perfect.  Metallica.  A Metallica song a lot of our audience certainly knows.  Yeah, that would have been perfect.  Ride the Lightning.  Execution.  Yeah.  Boom.  Well, that's an electric chair.  Right.  Ride old Sparky.  Thank you, Albert.  I'm the Lightning.  Oh, well, we'll rock.  You'll get it one day.  Josh, why are you here?  And I mean that in a nice way, just for the people out there.  Oh, my wife got me a sit-in with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:28:30]  I liked it better the way you were started.  She got this through a charity auction, and it was just a sit-in with Opie and Anthony day.  What's that about, Sam?  They did a charity thing around here?  Yeah, I guess there was a...  I remember agreeing to this.  Yeah, yeah.  We all agreed to, yeah, sure.  We agreed to the Super Bowl.  Yeah, this was one of the many things we agreed to that day.  I think there's like a SiriusXM-wide contest, and the winner gets to whatever.  I like charities.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of the charity thing.  So we said, sure, we'll be involved. 
[01:29:00]  So what, you had a bid to sit in here or something, and you won?  Yeah, pretty much.  Nice.  And what did that entail by winning?  It entailed a chance to sit in on the show with Opie and Anthony, and that's about it.  That was it?  Yeah.  Well, no, actually, there's supposed to be a t-shirt.  Oh.  All right.  And there's supposed to be a t-shirt.  So, obviously, you're from New York. 
[01:29:30]  Where are you from?  New York, because...  North Carolina.  All right, so he's...  Oh, so you get it already?  See, I think you've got to be from New York, because then, you know...  Did you get it?  You got it?  Oh, yeah, I think I get this now.  Reason number...  What reason are we up to, Sam?  188, maybe?  Yeah, I think this is 188.  Okay.  Yes, people.  We are talking to Josh, who won a charity auction to sit in to watch us today.  Yeah.  And he gets a t-shirt.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Here's the problem.  He had to find his own way to New York from North Carolina.  Find your way here.  We don't care.  They didn't even give him, like, end a certain amount  of cash, so you could, you know, get up here.  Look at Jimmy's face.  It's funny to me, because I know Josh.  I'm like, dude, you could have just asked me.  I would have just had to come in if you wanted to.  Yeah, I know.  That charity thing is like, hey, Jim, can I come in?  Yeah, sure.  Of course.  But why, as a company that's pretty, you know, it trades on Wall Street.  How well.  Why wouldn't they throw in, like, a flight if you're not close to New York? 
[01:30:30]  I wish they would just maybe offer to reimburse me for my flight.  That would be good.  Oh, my God.  Are you at least, like, maybe going to do some spots around town?  Yeah.  I'm going to at least get to see some friends.  Yeah, there you go.  Josh is a comic, and he's worked with Jimmy a little bit in Baltimore.  He was telling me.  That's where you're at, yes.  As we were awkwardly peeing in the bathroom.  But then when he came in, I was like, oh, it's a shot. 
[01:31:00]  I didn't think it was him, because they said it was a contest room.  Yeah.  And he's getting thinner now.  Someone just wrote.  My body looks better.  Wow, I can't say who.  Wow, I hate your company.  From Milk Ham.  Okay.  I was going to go with just the initials.  But every day, it's just another thing that is mind-boggling.  How do you have a charity auction, and you don't offer some kind of way to get to the prize?  Which is us.  Get to the prize.  It already hurts.  You won. 
[01:31:30]  Give until it hurts.  How is that winning, if you have to find your own way to the prize?  Yeah, that is stupid.  I said, these guys don't make a lot of money.  And then Jim says, yeah, I would have just got you in.  That was the capper.  Yeah, that's a good capper right there.  It took, it wasn't just from my wife.  It was from my wife, my brother.  So it took three family members.  Can I ask how much did it cost you, charity-wise?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  Because then they would argue, well, we want as much money as possible going to the charities.  Certainly.  But if you throw in, and we'll get there, get you there, people would bid more. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  Because then they don't have to worry about fucking figuring out flights.  How they're going to get here.  Oh, boy.  This fucking place.  This fucking place is stunning.  Stunning.  Hey, Dr. Gay's got the shirt.  Dr. Gay!  Not necessary.  We just found you a dusty t-shirt.  There it is.  I wonder where those were.  Under my desk.  In a box, in a clean box.  Covered with cum for when he watches gay porn.  Because he's Dr. Gay! 
[01:32:30]  Are you a large or an extra large?  Large.  Uh-huh.  Here you go.  All right.  There's your t-shirt.  Well, there, I guess this transaction is complete.  All right.  Thank you.  That's it.  Enjoy the show.  You had to fly from North Carolina to New York on your dive.  You are paid in full.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit, man.  That's a terrible prize.  A horrible prize.  The thing is, this is a prize people have gotten in the past, and anyone can really get 
[01:33:00]  if they just pretty much email.  It's like, hey, I'm going to be in town.  Right.  I'm a big fan of the show.  Is there any way I can just come in?  Please don't.  Can I ask?  All we're going to get now is people on Twitter going, hey, I'm going to be in New York.  Can I come in and watch the show?  Watch the show.  I love the show.  Can I ask Josh?  The dub life.  How much was your flight?  Round trip, I think it was $250.  Oh, God.  All right.  But how does that hurt to throw in a $250 plane ticket? 
[01:33:30]  And I'm getting word from Keith in Philly.  He's a regular.  He bid $1,200 to come in today.  Oh.  And he lost.  Wow.  Okay.  So your family bid more than $1,200.  Wow.  Hunger thong.  And then you had to throw in your...  Well, at least they got you a hotel knowing that you're from out of town, right?  No.  Not even a fucking room?  You have no place to go back to once you leave the studio.  Holy shit. 
[01:34:00]  What's wrong with them?  These people are terrible.  First prize is a trip to the airport.  There's no flight attached to it.  We just pick you up and take you to the airport.  Is this just a bad dream?  Yeah.  How do you sit down as a fucking normal human being and think that's okay?  I don't know.  No hotel.  No flight.  What?  Well, I have the description.  Okay.  Sit in on SiriusXM's Opie and Anthony show in New York.  Plus, you will take home a t-shirt signed by the entire show. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, hey.  Hey.  And that's it.  I didn't agree to sign anything.  Boy, they really skimped on the gifts.  And what's the estimated value?  $2,000.  $2,000?  It's estimated.  How much is the shirt worth?  $1,800?  $2,000?  That's what they estimate it to be worth.  Sam, maybe that's why you haven't gotten a raise.  Maybe they just estimate that you're sitting in here every day.  That's two grand a day.  It's your estimated pay.  And all they could come up with is a lousy t-shirt. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, by the way, you're not allowed to take photographs because it's not in the description.  Oh, boy.  Now there's trouble.  And we have stickers, but I mean, it's not in the description.  But there was nothing else we could give them?  This has nothing to do with us.  You could give them a second t-shirt.  That way you could sign one.  I don't know.  It's not in the rules.  And you know how they are about the rules.  Oh, they're sticklers.  And I gotta go get another shirt.  Maybe they just signed the XL one.  So, Josh.  We can do that.  You sounded like management right there, though, too.  This isn't us, see. 
[01:35:30]  This has been given to us.  You absolutely sounded like sleazy management.  No, I'm sounding like a guy who is not responsible for this.  Ah, pass the buck.  Learned that from Steve C., did you?  Yes.  During his tenure.  One of the many things I took away from his tenure.  Sam, you want to break this down?  What just happened here?  Well, basically, Josh, who lives in North Carolina, his family chipped in altogether 
[01:36:00]  and paid over $1,500.  You think over $1,500?  I would think over $1,500 easily.  Okay.  I would guess closer to $2,000, possibly.  Yeah.  All right.  For a chance to sit in on the Opie and Anthony show.  And he won.  And he won.  However, nobody provided him with a method to get to his prize.  Or a place to stay after said prize.  Hey, wait a minute.  What?  What? 
[01:36:30]  There's another item.  It says, meet DJ Sway.  Right.  And it's valued at $2,500.  But, but, you also get to guest co-host his show.  What do you think he's doing right now?  He's talking.  Okay, he's on the mic.  He's fucking doing more than Fez does.  What's the video?  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  I don't understand why.  You know what?  That surprised me, too.  It's not a...  It did.  That one surprised me, too.  Standalone winner.  I didn't even realize I was saying that.  Oh, my God.  Can I take that back? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, you can.  I swear to God, that just surprised me as well.  Meet Martha Stewart at a taping of her radio or television show in New York City.  $2,500 bucks.  Why are we $2,000 to meet that cryptic twat?  I'll say this.  You guys had more bids than anyone else aside from Martha Stewart.  Aside from Martha Stewart?  We stink.  Right.  Yeah, but the number is nine bids.  Nine bids?  Nine bids!  Nine bids.  Only ten bids from Martha Stewart. 
[01:37:30]  Who else?  Who else?  Let's see.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  We used to be famous, right?  Yeah, I remember those days.  And Sway didn't give a signed t-shirt, either.  Be a guest DJ on SiriusXM's Seriously Sinatra.  Okay, well, they had 18 bids.  Can I see this?  Sure.  I didn't know this page existed.  Whoa.  What's this?  Host Your Own Concert.  I don't think...  The name of this page is called Charity Buzz.  I don't think there was much of a buzz.  No, there was none.  My God. 
[01:38:00]  Was that the dude from Marky Ramon?  Have a drum lesson with Marky Ramon?  $2,500.  I mean, I guess he's technically a Ramon.  Yeah, he was.  Technically.  All right, all right.  What else is there?  I like this.  Meet Tony Hawk?  What?  How much is that worth?  Way more than you.  Wait, what the fuck is that?  Estimated value of $10,000?  $10,000?  Oh, visit his private skate park.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah, but guess what?  Visit his private skate park means you've got to get to the skate park. 
[01:38:30]  Right, right, right.  Let's see.  Let's see that.  Let's see.  Maybe they provide airfare, though.  Let's see if there's airfare and hotel provided.  Oh, okay.  That's a good idea.  No, I don't think there is.  I know.  The experience will give you the opportunity to meet the world's most famous skateboarder,  the legendary Tony Hawk.  You'll visit Tony's private skate park, home of the Birdhouse Skateboards in Southern Cal.  While there, you'll see Tony's giant huck jam ramps.  That's what I call my dick.  Meet Tony huck jam ramps. 
[01:39:00]  And sit in on a live broadcast of Tony's demolition radio.  This is a dream come true for any skater from 6 to 60.  So basically...  No airfare, no hotel.  Traveling.  $10,000.  Travel.  What's that?  And hold accommodations not included.  That's $10,000.  That's five times the prize of being on this show is seeing his skate ramps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The listeners are killing it today.  Text punch him.  Oh, Roland won this.  Text punch him on Twitter end. 
[01:39:30]  He writes, congrats.  You won debt.  You won debt.  $10,000.  Okay, that.  Keep going.  Let's see.  I like this.  This is fun.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What?  What are we looking at?  I'm trying to find something that's a little more.  Oh, wait a minute.  Spend the morning with Mike and Mike at ESPN in Bristol, Connecticut.  That's $2,500.  That's $500 more than this show. 
[01:40:00]  $500 more to be with Mike and Mike.  But see, you can't even fly into Bristol.  Well, let's see if Mike and Mike can...  Now you're looking at a cab fare.  Why is that worth more than this show?  Those are estimated values.  Well, why do they estimate our values?  Exactly.  I don't know.  Well, they're on ESPN, too.  So what?  Exactly.  Who gives a fuck about ESPN, too?  Oh, my God.  Those are the same names.  It's creepy.  But at least now you guys aren't so disappointed about Sway getting to go to the Super Bowl.  Because he's worth more than you.  Another losing bid just came in on Twitter. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, no.  G-A-T-T-M-A-B-R-I-E-L-E.  Because I try to promote people's Twitters.  That's a horrible one.  $1,800 and lost.  Oh, wow.  See, these are just estimated.  A lot of times it goes over the estimated.  Yeah, but somebody estimated these.  Someone sat there and said, that's an estimated value.  And Mike and Mike are worth $500 more.  I think Sway is worth $500 more.  Oh, by the way, they will give you a tax form.  Yes, you will get a form.  But because it's for charity, maybe you'll be all right. 
[01:41:00]  I don't know.  He could write it off, but not the whole thing.  That's why they say estimate, because that's what they have to write down in their paperwork.  Wow.  You can meet the blue-collar guys.  The estimated value is $2,500.  Two tickets to meet and see blue-collar comedy stars.  Jeff Fox.  A show of your choice.  Take home an autographed Cars 2 toy.  Ooh.  Supplied by Eric Nagel.  Yes, made out to his nephew. 
[01:41:30]  No, my son on that one.  Oh, that's great.  Why were the cable guys signing the truck?  Nice.  All right, what else?  Fish.  It's the Fish concert at Madison Square.  Gives a shit.  Fucking overrated, jamming shit.  Yeah, it does stink.  Crap.  All right, with some of these we don't know, guest DG on XM's EMS.  Wow.  Can you go to the Get the Ultimate EMS Experience in Memphis? 
[01:42:00]  What?  Elvis.  Elvis?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I couldn't read.  My eyes are getting banned.  The LV, I was in there.  Wow, okay.  Oh, you get to go to Graceland, I guess?  All right.  Okay.  That's $25,000.  But I'm sure you guessed DJ.  I'm sure you don't get a trip to Graceland.  No.  Again, no airfare, no hotel.  You've got to try to find a room in Graceland,  and hopefully you can fall asleep without anyone noticing.  Personal tour of Graceland with Elvis's best friend, George Klein. 
[01:42:30]  Guest DJ.  Two platinum tours of his Graceland, which they're imagining.  Yeah, that's $25,000.  Two nights at the Heartbreak Hotel.  What?  A hotel?  Oh, they're giving a hotel.  Transportation not included.  Why would it be?  All right.  Yeah, well.  All right, well, Josh, congratulations.  Congrats, man.  Sam, on your...  Yeah, let's not take away from that.  What did Josh win again, Sam?  What did he actually win here?  I'm very confused.  He won a chance to sit here and watch you guys do radio. 
[01:43:00]  Watch his bitch.  Watch the magic.  He spent the first hour also reading the newspaper,  which he got for free.  Right.  Oh.  Well, that wasn't included, by the way.  How much was the paper?  $2,000.  Bill him.  He gets a T-shirt that you guys have to sign.  We have to.  It's not he gets a signed T-shirt.  It's like, he gets a T-shirt that you guys have to sign.  It says, you will take home.  Yeah, it makes it sound so much like we don't want to do that.  I love how it's written.  You will take home, meaning we're going to shove it on you. 
[01:43:30]  You will take this home.  We have no choice but to sign that T-shirt.  Yes.  But who would bid on this?  And the only cost...  You get to see us in a lousy T-shirt,  but you have to pay for your airfare and your hotel?  And then it says, don't miss your chance to be a part of the action.  Yeah, you'd hate to pass up the madness happening in this.  Crazy.  Crazy house.  I just saw the $2,500 Sway walk into his studio.  True.  He's here all fucking walking like, I'm going to the Super Bowl. 
[01:44:00]  That's how he was walking.  I'm going to the fucking Super Bowl.  Oh, there's so much inside.  Yes?  Kenny just noticed that they gave Sway better hours than you.  Oh, well, that's for sure.  Eight o'clock.  That's nice.  He starts at eight.  And there he goes.  He's leaving.  He's done with his show.  Yeah, he's...  Eight million dollars.  Sway is eight to noon.  So when we try to move this back to seven, because it made sense, why...  Morning radio is six to ten, Opie.  It has been since Marconi invented it.  Seven to eleven is way better. 
[01:44:30]  He's better.  Marconi didn't have syndication, that prick.  Because for some reason, the company also wants to not acknowledge that there's anything  going on past Cincinnati.  Is there?  It's an East Coast...  Do we even own that?  Is that the United States?  We're syndicated on WKRP.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  Boo.  Boo.  Shouldn't you move the hours so your morning show is kind of heard around the country?  They did that first way.  Of course.  I mean...  Eric and I were talking about how much we used to love the seven to eleven.  It just makes sense. 
[01:45:00]  He says he loves seven eleven.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  We were talking about two different things, Eric.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, boy.  Slurpy boy.  It just never ends, Eric.  Oh, yes.  I'm sorry.  People are amazed, but...  Yes.  Josh will be paying taxes on the $2,000 estimated value.  Yeah.  Enjoy paying a grand.  Yeah.  But, I mean, keep in mind...  Because it's a charity thing, I think there's a little workaround, hopefully.  You're looking at the cost. 
[01:45:30]  Our minimum.  The costs were like a couple thousand dollars for the auction, a flight to and from New  York, and then a hotel room in New York City.  But, he gets to sit here and he gets a shirt.  No, he needs to be a part of the action.  No, he's taxed.  He actually is taxed on the prize, but he can write off the tax on what he paid.  So, you can, like, say, if he paid $2,000, you could take a tax deduction on the $2,000,  because it's a charitable contribution. 
[01:46:00]  What about the plane and the hotel?  See, thank God there wasn't any of that, because that would have cost you.  Yeah, but you can't put a price tag on fun.  No, you can't.  And, boy, is this fun.  It sure is.  Action-packed.  The action.  You're part of the action.  How exciting was it, by the way, when the mics were off, and I asked Kenny if I could  get a chicken noodle soup.  Was that fucking exciting?  Did you hear me ask for Purell?  I mean, the inside info.  I know.  The shit he's getting to take home and go, wait till you hear what I heard. 
[01:46:30]  You guys are giving it all away.  Now no one's going to buy it next year.  We were motherfuckering some people.  Well, he did hear a few things at the beginning before we realized there was a guest in the  studio.  We were motherfuckering some people.  I whispered to Anthony, I go, how long has he been sitting there?  The whole time.  What did he hear?  Everything.  What did he hear?  Everything.  What you fail to realize is you motherfucked the same people on the air for the last hour.  Well, see, that's true.  Yes.  That's the beauty of us.  But off the air sounds worse. 
[01:47:00]  And you're right about the tax thing.  He should be looking at this as a positive because if the airfare and the hotel had been  included in the auction, he would have been stuck paying for part of that.  Right.  Now, I think your tax write-off on the initial contribution is going to cover the cost of  your trip here.  Okay.  Yeah.  A guy that knows way more about charities than us and taxes, a guy named Zeket on Twitter,  Z-E-C-K-E-T, writes, and a lot of people are confirming this, XM, Sirius XM. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, no.  Gets the write-off.  No.  The winner pays the taxes on the prize.  Okay.  Hold it.  So, Sirius XM is giving that money to whatever it is.  I was going to say Charity Begins at Home.  Hey, it's BAB.  Right.  They're collecting all the money for these great prizes.  World Hunger Year or something.  Yeah.  They're collecting all the money.  So, they give it to them.  And they're pushing it to a charity.  So, they get the write-off.  And he's stuck with the bill. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  He's going to have to pay taxes on the $2,000 estimated price.  Oh, man.  Without a doubt.  That's coming in a lot.  But what happens to the money that he gave?  Like, what does he say that went?  Where does he say that went?  Technically, he wasn't giving to charity.  Well, you can write that off, though.  The charities are...  You can write off giving to charity.  The incumbent allows you that, Naughton.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You can't double dip.  Because he's buying for the...  You can't double dip.  So, the company is using his money as a tax. 
[01:48:30]  To give to charity.  Right.  He's not giving to charity.  He's bidding.  He's buying a prize.  He's buying something.  He's officially not giving to charity.  Everyone's saying it, Ant.  This is crazy.  Usually, when you get one, you're like, all right, we've got to do a little more research.  But everyone's saying it.  Does he have to pay sales tax on the bid?  He's got to pay...  And pay tax on the prize.  Well, now...  Because he's buying a bid.  Now it's getting complicated.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I know he has to pay the taxes on the estimated cost of the price.  Well, if you listen to MSNBC, you're still not doing your part. 
[01:49:00]  Wow.  Before you bid, your bid is a contract.  All bids placed on Charity Buzz Auctions' website are legally binding.  If you are the successful bidder, you will enter into a legal contract to purchase the item  and will be considered the buyer of the law.  Buyer of the law.  See?  Oh, motherfucker!  See?  Oh, no!  Let me ask you, who decides what prize is worth?  I have no idea.  I don't even know if this company does.  Josh is panicking.  Josh wants to go home.  Josh wants to call the whole thing off.  I just wanted a camera for Christmas. 
[01:49:30]  And I got surprised with this.  Yeah!  Surprise!  Josh is truly panicking.  He got the gift that keeps on taking.  It's horrible.  It's $2.50 for the flight.  Right.  Hotels at least.  Where are you staying?  Actually, I'm staying with a friend, so I save a little money that way.  All right.  So you're on someone's couch.  You're on someone's couch.  Yeah, you're on my friends, Ricky. 
[01:50:00]  The phrasing is that, I save a little money that way.  He has to save money.  I save money on the prize that you won for purchasing something that the company then  takes the money for and gets a charitable fucking contribution tax right off.  Oh, that's nice.  This place blows!  I love when it comes from you.  Puddle of Aids, who runs a great sports blog called, he had to change the name.  Mentality Magazine.  Mentality Magazine.  It's great.  Ted Williams' head.  Why don't you change that? 
[01:50:30]  Advertisers.  He's trying to go legit.  I love these websites that start off with something really dirty and nasty and they're  like, we've changed it to, wow, we rule.  I know.  It's like, really?  What happened?  Cutsniffer.com is no longer, it's going to be baseball follies.  It's ass sniffer.  Whoops, we made a mistake.  He's trying to go legit and he should because his stuff is good.  He writes, I love that this guy paid $2,000 to sit in studio and listen to how dumb he is  for paying $2,000 to sit in studio. 
[01:51:00]  That's called the action.  Huh?  That's called the action.  Oh yeah.  What's going on, Jimmy?  Being a part of the action.  You're part of the action.  It's an action packed morning.  It's filled with action.  And intrigue.  Yeah.  Is there intrigue today?  There's a lot of intrigue.  I like this.  Tom the mechanic.  Josh will be explaining all this to an IRS agent one day during an audit.  Yes, but my family just wanted to give me a great Christmas gift.  Jail.  No fines. 
[01:51:30]  He just wanted a camera.  He wanted a camera.  Now he's just involved with all sorts of tax papers.  Tax problems.  Probably those forms you'd never had to deal with ever.  You get them in the mail, you don't even know what they're for.  Right.  You can't fill them out.  Now you've got to pay an accountant to do your taxes, which you probably were able to do yourself.  Sam?  That'll cost you.  I want them to use that picture on the poster after all.  Oh no.  No.  Oh.  Uh oh.  What picture are they using? 
[01:52:00]  This one.  Oh no.  That one's still good.  But it can't.  Why?  I think we already approved a proof.  Poster, I hear, is coming today.  Today?  Is it?  Is it that?  That's what I was told by Rob Cross.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Is Gary here so we can find out about the Super Bowl thing?  We haven't even started our show yet.  Do you want me to go check?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is all the preliminary stuff.  We haven't started our show yet.  I'm taking one of Anthony's crackers.  See, the listeners don't know that, but Josh has the inside skinny. 
[01:52:30]  Because he's part of the action.  Part of the action.  How was it?  You want a pack of saltines?  Ooh.  Yeah.  And I gave him a water.  Prison food.  I gave him a prison food.  If you crush a roach, you can eat that too.  We're feeding him like Papillon.  He's getting crackers and water.  This show stinks.  Holy shit, this is horrible.  But I think you just broke the rules.  What happened?  And I guarantee they'll say that too.  Please don't feed the guest.  I don't give him anything else.  It's not in the works.  What if he has a cracker allergy?  Well, then he should be over on Sway Show. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Crackers and waters.  Water for our guest.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, did anyone take his shoelaces?  Wow.  He gets one phone call right to the lawyer or something.  Yeah, Chip.  Could you at least fart for Josh, Jim?  That would be very special.  I had the banana and yogurt. 
[01:53:30]  I mean, and cottage cheese.  Let's give it some time.  All right.  You want to see some action, Josh.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I don't want to tell him how to do it.  You're going to hear and smell it.  Sam's coming back.  I think we have an update.  He wouldn't be running unless he isn't.  He's doing his faggy run and he's smiling and laughing.  Sam doesn't run well.  Sam runs like a fruit.  Is Gary here?  Not yet.  He's not here yet?  No.  He babysits the channel.  This must be great.  This is like me hiring a babysitter for my kid and I leave and maybe two hours later the babysitter shows up. 
[01:54:00]  He can't even do that right.  Well, there's a chance he might not be here.  Why?  He's not feeling well.  Yeah, he wasn't feeling well yesterday.  He went home early yesterday.  How could you tell?  What?  Yeah, really?  What did he get some color in his cheeks?  You don't look like yourself.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's a human at home.  You want to call him?  Oh, God.  He's probably laying right now back on the sofa with a cold rag on his head.  With a cold giant towel on his head. 
[01:54:30]  Barely covering it.  Oh, God.  He's got a big lightbulb head.  My first meeting with Gary, Blatter sits me down and goes, oh, this guy.  He could get things done.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, this is the guy you guys need.  He's like Red.  He's like Red from Shawshank.  Yeah.  He's the guy.  I need a rock hammer to get through your skull. 
[01:55:00]  By the way, we got a meeting today after the show.  Now, I didn't hear about this.  You said yes to it.  Yeah, I think you did.  When?  A week or two ago.  He's laughing.  I do kind of remember something about a meeting.  Yeah.  Then it was canceled.  Rescheduled, not canceled.  Oh, see, that's the part I missed.  And the new rule is to get me to Blatter's office without passing Greenstein's office.  Where I don't do meetings.  It's impossible.  Because he puts me immediately in a bad mood for days. 
[01:55:30]  Here's the thing, though.  How many days?  Honestly, his, it's at least two days.  Just seeing him?  Just seeing him, yes.  Wow.  No joke.  But you don't get this.  Not even a joke.  I'll put it on camera.  You can see my face drastically change instantly.  Opie, there's a problem, though.  His arm's even making the angry arm movement.  You know, I can't sleep from the video.  Here's the problem.  The show ends.  I rush to the office to get the meeting over ASAP, as they say.  I'm sitting in there for a good ten minutes before you guys stroll in. 
[01:56:00]  A good ten minutes.  Me and Jimmy have to add their own bladders.  Ask Kenny.  He sees it.  I don't want to sit in that office with that man alone.  He's got the same stuff on the walls he had five years ago when I first...  How about you add one new thing, Blatter?  One new poster.  You think the bag of chips is still there?  What's that?  Oh, why did I do that?  Why?  But yes, it is the same thing of salsa items.  What is it?  It's like Jimmy Buffett's salsa and some of these... 
[01:56:30]  These little dipping chips.  Yeah.  But it's a bag that's been there for five straight years.  Yeah.  Can you take a picture of it?  Maybe it's an MRE, like in the military.  You can fucking open it.  It still goes.  Goes forever.  Yeah.  Keeps forever.  It's a little loud.  There's one of them pickers.  What now?  What now?  What is this?  What are we doing?  I'm looking at a picture.  What are we doing?  Now we're just looking at pictures of them and laughing?  Is that what we're doing now?  Okay. 
[01:57:00]  Why is he with those people?  Blatter is standing uncomfortably in...  He looks like the fucking nephew of a record producer who's jumped in with the fucking  rap group.  No, he wore his hoodie to fit in, man.  Oh, no.  Who are they?  That's G-Unit.  Oh, damn.  That's Fiddy.  That's Fiddy.  And who, kid?  Where's the who?  Oh, I see the who.  Our guest would like to know... 
[01:57:30]  Oh, bladder.  ...if he could spend a little more money, how much does it cost to sit in on the meeting?  That would be a...  You should bring him as your special guest.  I'm going to have to check with a lot of lawyers, but I say we let him sit in for your  show today, Sam.  How about in lieu of us in the meeting?  You go to the meeting.  Wait, do you really think you wore his hoodie to fit in?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There is with Bieber.  Wow, does that look like a child molester?  That's...  He looks like the guy that claimed to kill JonBenet Ramsey.  Remember that guy who's just looking... 
[01:58:00]  They flew him back...  Yes, they flew him back from Thailand where he was in Dutch.  John Carr?  Wow, good memory.  Yeah, John Carr.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  I believe it was.  John Michael Carr?  That guy was a car rogue.  Hey, he's John Carr.  Oh, boy.  Hey, did you eat those crackers?  I had two.  Could I have them?  I'm starving.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy crushed him.  I don't care.  Cracker crumbs is good.  Cracker crumbs rule, dude. 
[01:58:30]  What's better than wetting your finger and scooping up cracker crumbs?  No, I like just pouring out...  Oh, good.  Love you.  Wish that was fucking cinnamon.  I feel bad I broke Anthony's crackers.  I don't care.  He ate them.  All right, we should break then.  Oh, Steve looks so uncomfortable.  Yo, man, jump in for a picture.  He doesn't belong in that picture.  Of course he doesn't.  His hands are in his pockets. 
[01:59:00]  I'll bet you the guy that...  I couldn't think of anything.  He can't even stand next to 50.  No, he's like...  Two people over.  Just standing there.  How long ago was this?  Uncomfortable.  I mean, it appears to be probably around when Shade 45 was starting to launch and stuff.  Yeah, it was a while back.  Oh, Sirius, right?  Oh, it's just Sirius logo.  Not that lucrative XM part that they tagged on after they completely destroyed that company. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Josh, welcome aboard.  Stay tuned for more action.  Yeah, strap in.  More action on the way.  The Opinion Anthony Channel.  Oh, yeah!  On Sirius XM.  Humanitarian Anthony Cumia is calling arms to help fight a problem affecting children across the country.  These little monstrous children with half of their upper lip and bottom of their nose missing. 
[02:00:00]  The Anthony Cumia Fund for cleft palate children is doing all it can to help treat newborns with hair lip and cleft palate.  Little predator-faced monsters.  According to the Cleft Palate Foundation, one out of 700 births in the United States will result in cleft lip.  Anthony Cumia sees this as an astounding statistic.  Send your money so they could sew that gaping hatchet wound shut on these kids' upper jaws. 
[02:00:30]  Won't you give and help Anthony fight this debilitating deformity in children across the country?  It's the Cleft Palate Program for little kids.  Look at what we did.  We helped a little monster.  Be proud and say you gave to the Anthony Cumia Fund for cleft palate children.  I'm Anthony Cumia and I endorse this cleft palate program.  And now, here's 32 seconds, quote-unquote, with Ving Rhames, quote-unquote, talking about the, quote-unquote.  I grew up, quote-unquote, under hood rules. 
[02:01:00]  I grew up on 126th Street in Harlem.  You feel me?  There's a hood rule that you don't, quote-unquote, snitch on me.  That's a hood rule.  You see what I'm saying?  Now, that's different than, quote-unquote, mainstream America rules.  You see what I'm saying?  But in mainstream America, that's hood rules.  You see, and so, one, people don't understand, quote-unquote, street codes and hood rules.  You see what I'm saying?  Oh, I'll put it this way.  Only the hood, quote-unquote, can police the hood, period, quote-unquote, period.  You see?  Where's Egypt?  Egypt is in Africa.  That was 32 seconds of, quote-unquote, Ving Rhames talking about the hood, quote-unquote, the end, quote-unquote. 
[02:01:30]  And I'll leave it at that, quote-unquote.  On an all-new Butt Files, homosexual sci-fi investigative couple, Muldouche and Sally argue the authenticity of a mysterious pornographic take.  Why are you being so confrontational?  Because I didn't tell you to watch shit.  You implied it.  Saying, well, hey, you didn't watch this yet.  When you watch this, you're going to be blown away.  When did I tell you to watch it?  I said I found it interesting.  Dude, why are you being like this now?  We're just talking about this. 
[02:02:00]  Wow, Mr. Passion over here.  But the couple soon finds their homoerotic partnership spiraling out of control.  Don't touch me.  I don't want you to touch me.  Oh, my God.  I don't want you to touch me.  I don't want you.  Who the fuck did you be touching me?  I'm trying to talk to you.  You don't have to touch me.  You can talk to me and not touch me.  Find out if the two lovers will find the transgendered individuals responsible for their dilemma.  You're like, oh, I'm telling you to watch this.  I didn't tell you to watch it.  You're making shit up.  Why are you so hung up on this for?  Why are you so mad at me today?  Because every time I come in here and I say something that you don't like, this is what you do.  Here, ready?  All on the next Butt Files. 
[02:02:30]  Sirius XM.  This is the ODN 3 Show.  Oh, Josh, hurry back in.  You're going to miss some action.  Yeah, the action.  It's us, yeah.  Is a Watto coming in today?  Yes.  Otto, Sam.  Not Watto.  I say Otto.  I don't know. 
[02:03:00]  Watto.  Watto.  Is Josh invited to the after show today?  I'll let you stay for $300.  Damn.  That's a good deal.  Do you want more Super Bowl information or are you done?  See, you're pushing my button.  I'm just asking.  Which I like.  Well, you're the guy.  You're like the man on the street around Sirius XM's satellite radio.  You know what's going on.  You have your nose to the grindstone, your ear to the rail.  That's right.  Whatever else they say.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, we officially haven't started our show yet today. 
[02:03:30]  We haven't done anything current.  No.  Not one thing.  Well, we did get topical with this X-Men.  All right, right, right.  That's true.  And a lot of people are yelling at me that they do know that Jane's Addiction song because  it was in Natural Born Killers.  Who cares?  I don't remember that song in Natural Born Killers.  No one does.  And I like that fucking movie.  You know it because you're a fan, so shut up, peoples.  I don't remember that song.  But fair enough.  They said a lot of people know it.  So sorry, E-Rock. 
[02:04:00]  Just kidding.  I'm never sorry.  But we learned today that we're not going to the Super Bowl for the 17th year in a row.  Yes.  17 years.  17 years we've been trying to go to the Super Bowl.  We can blame Sirius XM for the last seven.  Yeah.  Well, what's funny is that you bring up the numbers.  Yeah.  Because I have two bits of information that you can take or leave.  Not only are we not going to the Super Bowl, we don't have Super Bowl tickets to give away,  but it seems like other channels do. 
[02:04:30]  But we're not in that category of importance around here.  And the first one is a rumor.  There's a rumor of another show going down.  The second is fact, and it is the amount of how many of the last Super Bowls Kavino and Rich have been to.  Okay.  Oh.  Now, if you like both pieces, if you like none of them.  Nothing against those guys.  I've been on their show and I like them.  Yeah.  You know, I really do.  Yeah, me too.  But why do they get to go to the Super Bowl but we don't? 
[02:05:00]  I don't understand that.  Yeah.  Like, someone break that down.  Why?  Because they talk more sports than us?  Kenny just almost broke the door down.  I know.  He's flying in here.  He just did a sitcom entrance.  Yes.  Because they have dude bros.  Why is Sam dying?  Oh, my God.  What's a dude bro?  They have dude bros and nussies.  Wait, what?  What is that?  What is that thing? 
[02:05:30]  That's what they call their peeps.  Sam, is he right?  Is that like a brother man, brother man, though?  Yeah, man.  A dude bro?  It's cooler.  It's much cooler.  Apparently so.  Can I steal dude bro from my catchphrase t-shirt?  Well, they may already have dude bro t-shirts.  You know what?  But if I copyright it, then they're fucking in trouble.  And they do song parodies.  You don't.  Yeah, we do.  We do it at the Bobo song.  Yeah.  Oh, you want the Bobo song?  On the after show, it was getting rated as a hit. 
[02:06:00]  Not a miss.  Doesn't say much for your after show.  Yeah, exactly.  They'd rather listen to anything.  Why is Covino and Rich going to the Super Bowl and we're not?  And how many Super Bowls have they gone to that we have not gone to?  You want that information before the information about the other show that might be going?  Oh.  What?  There's another show that might be going.  Kenny, are you done with why they're going and we're not?  Dude bros.  Dude bros and nussies, yeah.  Fuck, we need a...  What's a nussie? 
[02:06:30]  Why?  Female.  Yeah, but what does it mean?  Nothing.  Well, dude bro is a dude bro.  Yeah, we get the dude bro.  A nussie I don't get.  That's like man cave stuff.  What's a nussie?  I'm in the man cave.  Yeah, yeah.  With my dude bros.  My dude bro's in the man cave.  What's a nussie?  And the nussies are not allowed downstairs.  They're in the kitchen cooking us some food.  I'm like Nazi.  I'm like a nussie.  What is that?  And Jimmy has just left the show.  I don't blame him.  He had things to do.  No, he just left. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, it means a hotness?  Hot nuss.  Yeah, hotness.  Nussie.  Yeah, see they sell t-shirts, you know?  Boy, look at that dude.  Nussie Hunter.  Damn it.  Dad bro.  That's a dude bro.  That's a dad.  Super handsome.  Swoot?  What's swoot?  They just make up words.  Why don't I have a page of shirts?  Tickle sack.  I love nussies.  Is a tickle sack a bowl bag?  Team spot.  Yank D's instead of Yankees.  They could get in trouble for that logo, though. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, they can.  It's too close to the actual Yankee logo.  Let's report them.  And that's the Superman logo.  That's a copyright infringement.  Yeah, that too.  That's too close.  I think they'd have a problem with that.  Bottoms up.  Dat's.  Wassup.  Bottoms up.  Dat's.  Wassup.  They're sponsored by a beer company.  You're never sponsored by a beer company.  No, no.  We got a guy that takes flowers and dips them in gold. 
[02:08:00]  He's like a fucking Bond supervillain.  Yeah.  So how many of the last Super Bowls have you been to?  No.  Everyone knows.  We've been trying to go for 17 years.  So you're 0-17?  Yeah.  And then I could count the 10 years of radio I did before that.  So.  Wow.  I've never gone to a Super Bowl.  Covino and Rich.  Yeah.  As a show.  Yeah.  Have been to the last eight Super Bowls.  Wow.  How long have they been here? 
[02:08:30]  Eight years.  Holy shit.  They've sent them every year?  And we're not.  They were invented on the series.  What happened to the, do you guys want to go to the Super Bowl?  They were invented on this platform?  They didn't exist before this platform.  This platform put them together.  And we learned that Sway, who's been with the company, what's the real total?  Six months, maybe?  I don't even think six months.  It's after we were asked if we wanted to go to the Super Bowl.  Oh, Jimmy's back.  Hello.  It's not Jimmy.  It's Sweater Boy Cutie. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, Sweater Boy Cutie.  It's my new nickname.  Jimmy.  He's sweating Kashmir.  We're learning that Kavino and Rich are going to the Super Bowl.  Oh, good.  That's real.  And they're going to their eighth Super Bowl.  Eighth in a row.  And they've been here for eight years.  So they've been sent to the Super Bowl eight times by this company.  See, we're trying to keep it fun.  But look at Jimmy's body language.  And we haven't, not once.  Look at Jimmy's body language.  Well, you do.  It's just, there's no way to spin it.  It's ridiculous.  We're in a place with the company where, look, I love radio.  There's just no way to spin it. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Anymore.  I mean, I hate to get really real, but I have to.  We have to find another place to broadcast.  See, this is what happened.  I'll break it.  I'll break it down.  Break it down.  See, we were on the short end of the stick in this merger.  So we'll never be looked at as serious employees.  No, no.  That's the problem.  We were lucky enough to continue because most guys were shown the door.  We were raped in the shower, so we'll never get respect by the guys on the block. 
[02:10:00]  It just happens.  Yeah.  That's why we really do have to find another place because we're never going to get the respect that we deserve.  Sway has been here.  Because they just see XM on our foreheads.  Yeah.  And anything XM to these people, they have to either, you know, stomp on or get rid of.  Yeah.  And it's a shame.  Because why would you send Covino and Rich?  Nothing.  I swear, nothing against those guys.  For eight straight years.  Partners is fine.  And we don't even get to go.  Sway's been here six months and six days. 
[02:10:30]  And he goes.  Because guess what?  He's looked at as a serious employee.  Yeah.  He doesn't have the XM baggage.  We have this big bag of shit attached to us.  Steamer trunks of garbage and crap.  Because we happened to work for XM before the merger.  That's what's going on here, really.  Yeah.  XM was weird with us, too, though, man.  They were weird.  Remember when we used to complain to Logan?  Holy shit.  Way better, though.  Even though Logan loved us.  Much better.  Much better.  We talked about all the trips we went to.  No, I can't get them on the phone.  I'm in such a place with a show. 
[02:11:00]  I fucking hate the entertainment industry.  He called me the other day just to say that one of the pests was building his state-of-the-art office out there in L.A.  Because he had to move to L.A.  Did he move to L.A.?  Oh, right.  And he goes, I'll call you back so we can catch up for real.  But I just want to tell you that click.  Great.  So now he's not only, like, a bigwig in Harpo, but now he's not in Chicago anymore.  He's in the nice, warm L.A. where he'll get even more tan.  Yeah.  That fucking cocksucker.  Yeah.  That fucking cocksucker, Eric Logan. 
[02:11:30]  Jesus.  He left us in this mess.  Oh, rat leaving a sinking fuck.  That's been our career over and over again, too.  Guys that we did respect leaving as quickly as possible.  Flat lever.  Flat lever.  To their next big gig.  Yeah.  Oscar nomination.  All right.  So Covino and Rich are up to eight Super Bowls in a row they're going to.  Yep.  If Covino and Rich go next year, they will have been to more Super Bowls than any NFL team. 
[02:12:00]  Wow.  All right.  That's a great stat.  And we're finding, oh, wow.  I don't feel good.  You okay?  Wow.  I just got lightheaded.  What just happened?  You had a kiss?  I think we might have to cancel the meeting, Sam.  No.  I hope it doesn't feel good.  Yeah, it just hit me.  Oh, that's a shame.  Wow.  There's something going around.  It's so much that I wanted to discuss.  You know what?  We're going to have to reschedule, Sam.  Reschedule.  I don't know.  I mean...  I think I can make it to ten, but I should go home and get some rest. 
[02:12:30]  Reschedule.  Hasn't this meeting already been rescheduled once?  Well, that was him.  Look, I can't help it that all of a sudden I got sick.  He rescheduled once?  What's the matter?  Oh, we can't?  Are you okay, dude?  He doesn't sound good.  No, I don't feel good.  Kenny, can I have some water?  Yeah.  Maybe some orange juice.  I should get some vitamins in me.  I know.  What's the other show going to the Super Bowls?  This is Rumors.  Well, they all come true.  Yeah, exactly.  I understand Jerry Sandusky is broadcasting under the SiriusXM banner. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, and before this is spun, too, because everything is spun, Gary did this to himself.  Because he went up to me and Ant and said, do you guys want to go to the Super Bowl?  Right.  If he never said, do you guys want to go to the Super Bowl, we would have fucking let this slide.  Well, probably not, but it wouldn't have been as pertinent.  What other show's going?  Rumor has it that they may be sending Rosie.  What? 
[02:13:30]  To play for which team?  Oh, my God.  Bravo.  Yeah, it's going to play a defensive end.  Yeah, to protect Tom Brady.  That was information I got.  Rosie doesn't even acknowledge this place.  No.  She's already moved on to Oprah.  I got that information from Rich himself, from Kavino and Rich.  No, no, no.  Why would they do that?  I have no idea.  She's already taken their money and turned her back in this place, like many do. 
[02:14:00]  Is that Kavino and Rich's site, or is that a Sirius site?  Oh, wow.  Wait, that's a good question.  Wait, that's a good question.  Is that a Kavino and Rich site, or is that a personal site?  Yes.  Looks pretty nice.  Yeah.  That's good about him.  I cannot reveal the source on this one, but I have another confirmation for the Super Bowl.  Confirmation?  Yes.  This source?  Your phone is ringing off the hook.  People...  Yes.  It's the only time that's ever happened, believe me.  It certainly doesn't happen when he's job hunting. 
[02:14:30]  We got it, Jim.  You're sorry, Sam.  Can I tell you something else?  What?  We are rock stars around this place, because we're saying everything that everyone else  wants to say, so that's why our phones go off, because people are like, oh my god,  please mention that.  I'll tell them, because I'm pissed too.  And they're too scared to speak up, because they don't have the FU money yet.  I don't either.  I don't know why I'm the one saying everything, boy, dummy.  You're just a mess.  I wouldn't consider us rock stars, but we're like the Mike Becleries.  We walk around, people look at us and go, holy fuck, those are the guys. 
[02:15:00]  Those are the guys speaking for all of us.  Trust me on that.  All right, what do you know?  This was just sent to me.  Another show going to the Super Bowl.  From Raw Dog Comedy, Mark Says Hi.  Who the fuck is Mark Says Hi?  He's a nice guy.  But nothing against him.  I don't know him.  Shouldn't we know the guy?  Shouldn't we know the people that are going to the Super Bowl?  But does that mean they get to go to the game, or they're just going to the area?  We just want to go to broadcast. 
[02:15:30]  Podcast.  Fuck the game.  I'll find a great place to watch the game down there.  I don't give a fuck.  But we should get tickets as well.  Who is Mark Says Hi?  Looks like Jim Brewer.  No, that's Jim Brewer.  That is Jim Brewer.  And I swear, nothing against the guy.  I don't know him.  Yeah.  He hosts...  Could you give me a picture?  Yeah.  Have we seen him in the halls?  Club Soda Kenny's going to the Super Bowl.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's representing HorribleSuits.com.  Sorry, Jenny. 
[02:16:00]  You know, in all fairness to Sirius...  Yeah.  Just when you think he has run out of horrible colors to wear, it's a new color.  It's an amazing combination.  What is that?  Mauve?  It's a mauve.  Is that mauve?  And it's hepatitis yellow.  There was discussion about Sirius sending you to the Super Bowl at a hotel an hour away  and bussing you back and forth and, you know... 
[02:16:30]  But we didn't even have the opportunity to say no to that.  Yeah, what happened?  We didn't even...  We didn't even have the opportunity to say no.  We never heard of that.  So what happened?  We're...  We're...  Connecting flights.  Where's Mark Says Hi?  Where's he going to be staying?  Well, that I don't know.  But he hosts a one-hour show every day.  I would drive to Indianapolis for the Super Bowl.  A one-hour show.  Is that where it is, Indy?  Yeah.  It's a comedy request show.  So close.  It's a comedy request show.  So, Kenny, what happened?  But he's going?  Yeah, he's got a...  He's got a funny shirt on.  People can call in and request comedy bits while he's at the Super Bowl. 
[02:17:00]  No.  Well, that fits.  What?  What?  Who?  Well, you host comedy by request.  How?  So people are going to the Super Bowl.  I just assumed they...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They pulled back and...  Well, like, this source just told me Mark Says Hi is going.  And I heard Sway, Kavino, and Rich.  Mad Dog.  Mad Dog.  Oh, God.  And, I mean, I've heard...  And a bunch of salespeople, because they're going to do business down there.  And Rosie O'Donnell.  And Rosie O'Donnell.  And, you know... 
[02:17:30]  Wow, we're more important than every single one of those people.  Wow.  In our minds.  What's Rosie going to do at the Super Bowl?  I don't get it.  She talks to dykes.  Do dykes like football?  Yeah, I guess they do.  Probably, yeah.  Maybe it does make sense.  I guess that's an important demo.  Yeah.  Make sure the dykes are taken care of Super Bowl Sunday.  Exactly.  That's rude.  Is it?  Mm-hmm.  I haven't even gotten started.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:18:00]  You see him in the picture?  Huh?  That's him.  I really have never met the guy, and I'm not trashing him, because I don't know him.  Yeah, he's...  I just don't know the guy.  He doesn't shave enough for my taste.  But he's a nice dude.  He's a little stubbly?  Yeah.  A nice guy?  A very nice guy, yeah.  Good for him, man.  Oh, God.  He's going to the Super Bowl.  He's doing something right.  His name brings out rage in me.  Yeah.  I know.  I don't like that.  Says-hi.  It's horrible.  What does that even mean?  Unless it sounds like his last name.  Unless his last name is Sezai or something. 
[02:18:30]  Sezai.  His last name is Seaman.  Is it really?  Yeah, 100%.  Then I'd go with Seaman.  Why wouldn't you go with Seaman?  Seaman.  It's a comedy channel.  Mark Seaman coming up.  And then you say LOL.  And you shoot yourself in the temple.  Is Rosie going as the blimp?  Oh, that could be.  To get Ariel's footage?  Rosie.  My anonymous story is just texting me.  Obviously, this person has a bandana against Mark's eyes. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, man.  Because now he's texting me and saying it's how he introduces himself.  Mark says hi.  Mark says hi.  But...  Is that like a catchphrase introduction that he's got?  Yeah.  He says...  But isn't it implied when Mark comes up to you?  Yeah.  Speaking of himself in the third person.  Yeah, the third person's stupid.  When you just say, hi, I'm Mark.  Jim hates that.  Mark says hi.  Hi, my name is Mark Seaman.  Anthony says, kill yourself.  So does he say, hi, I'm Mark says hi?  I'll say, no, you're Mark Seaman.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Mark says hi. 
[02:19:30]  Mark says, oh.  Yeah.  Because, you know...  Mark says gulp.  Yes, exactly.  Seaman.  All right.  I don't like this at all.  I don't like this one bit.  Our guest, Josh, just wrote me a note.  Oh, cool.  He just has questions.  Now he's writing fucking notes.  That's great.  Well, hold on, Anthony.  You will be part of the action.  This is part of the action.  That's right.  Notepad will not be provided.  Must bring your own notepad and pen and sign a waiver. 
[02:20:00]  If you fall on pen, serious is not liable.  I would love to know what you had to sign to just even come into the studio.  And to be fair, it's like I have to read it because he won the thing.  Yeah.  Are these shows going to the Super Bowl going to have to pay for their own airfare in  hotel?  He wants to know.  That's true.  Yeah.  The shows themselves?  Well.  Not even winners of a contest or anything, but the shows.  Yeah.  Maybe that's the thing we'll hear.  Well, guys, we didn't want to pay for your own airfare.  Kenny in a panic because Kenny loves details. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  When the idea of us going to the Super Bowl came up, Kenny's like, do these people even  know that you have to plan this stuff a year in advance?  Yeah.  To get proper flights and hotels?  And you do.  And you wouldn't even have to fly first class.  How far is Indiana?  I wouldn't fly first.  Oh, I would fly first.  I would drive.  I have to.  But I mean, it's a small plane.  Yeah.  I have to fly first.  Some planes might not have the first class.  I would just drive.  I would charter a plane then because I cannot ever fly coach again.  I won't.  Well, the smaller planes don't have.  I won't. 
[02:21:00]  Oh.  So, I quickly, because then Watto's coming in here.  Where's Watto's here?  Yesterday, there was a discussion in my household.  My sister was saying that her daughter, who's young.  Going to the Super Bowl?  Going to the Super Bowl.  Oh.  And all her friends are doing the cinnamon challenge.  What?  Really?  It's a big thing that is happening in middle school.  Don't they know how dangerous that is?  Thank you.  So, I showed my sister the E-Rock video, and immediately she was in a panic calling her daughter, going, please don't do this anymore. 
[02:21:30]  E-Rock almost died right there.  He's a man meant to eat these.  Yes.  I seriously was worried that day.  I was, too.  I thought that was it for E-Rock.  I thought it was going to be a big problem.  I know.  His fucking face was so red.  But the video is, there's two things going on here.  It's like being on a cherry.  The video itself is amazing.  And it also gets the word out that, maybe, I hate to be this guy, but I'm a parent now, I guess. 
[02:22:00]  But there's parents out there that have no idea your fucking kids are doing this.  And we almost saw a guy die.  Oh, my God.  Here, start the video over.  Because you don't even need the video element.  The element.  The audio.  Nice freeze frame.  There was a puff of smoke that came out of his lungs.  And I studied this video last night with my sister.  Bob Kelly was the one that almost killed E-Rock.  Because he put the cinnamon way in the back of his throat.  And there was a lot dumped out on that.  We didn't know at the time.  We didn't know it was going to happen. 
[02:22:30]  And I'm amazed at how in shape E-Rock looks.  What?  Wow.  It looks like Guy Fieri now.  The hair.  Look at the video, though.  E-Rock's a lot thinner.  We're all thinner and younger in this video.  But you were still calling him fat.  Well, that's true.  Oh, really?  How many years ago was this?  Four.  2007.  December.  So just over four years ago.  Seems like yesterday, doesn't it?  So here's the audio of the best cinnamon challenge ever.  How this video is labeled on YouTube. 
[02:23:00]  Bad.  And a public service.  Can we hear it?  Are there any sound?  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's how the video just started.  Oh.  I'm going to just open your mouth.  Mouth.  Mouth.  Open your mouth.  Bob puts it in.  Watch how far back he puts it.  Oh, he did.  Fuck it off.  E-Rock is a-  Ah!  Ah!  The slow motion smoke.  Cinnamon smoke.  Smoke is coming out of his mouth.  When he coughs, it's terrible. 
[02:23:30]  Travis holds the microphone.  Travis is laughing.  He's loving it.  As a man is almost dying.  Wow.  Ah!  Smoke is coming out of his mouth.  Ah!  What is-  He can't breathe.  What you hear in his ear, I'm trying to get his breath, and he can't.  Oh, God, the smoke that came.  Drink a little water.  Dummy Anthony, drink a little water.  Water, water, water, water.  Death knell.  I don't know.  He can't breathe. 
[02:24:00]  His color's changing.  He's trying to breathe.  And his color's changing.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Something just came out of his forehead.  Slow motion again.  Yeah, the powder.  Cinnamon powder.  Is this the thing where his eyes turned red?  No, that was from the mayo challenge.  Oh, right.  When we almost killed him again. 
[02:24:30]  You couldn't breathe, right?  Here I am.  No, breathe like you-  And, uh, you have to breathe like you give a birth.  He's still trying to breathe.  He's beat red.  Oh, my God.  This is, like, gassing somebody.  That's how I feel when he talks.  Is that blood?  Now it's sinking in the back of his underwear.  Now they keep replaying. 
[02:25:00]  Travis laughing as the cloud of smoke comes out of his mouth.  The video doesn't do it justice because I remember it took him a few minutes before he was able to talk to you.  That?  Yeah.  That's cinnamon.  That's cinnamon.  All right.  You're okay.  Well, once again, it doesn't work.  You can't, you can't do that.  Stop the fuck up.  Yes, he did.  He didn't try.  Is that what I said? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  So, wow.  Iraq, you couldn't breathe?  No, not at all.  And especially when you said drink the water.  Yeah.  It just turned it into cement.  Oh, my God.  So, it was already caking into my throat, but the water just made it into a chunk.  Oh, man.  I don't know if anyone's ever died doing that.  It's really scary, and I'm going to step out of character today to the parents out there.  Your kids are absolutely trying this shit, and we saw it in front of our eyes that it is scary as hell.  Can't they just smoke marijuana?  I don't know if anyone has died, but it, I mean, it was a bad scene that day. 
[02:26:00]  I love the video.  I mean, we'll tweet that shit today, but...  Oh, yeah.  It's funny as fuck.  Iraq, tweet that shit, and I'll retweet you.  There's a shitload of videos we got to tweet today.  Anyway, so, yeah, because my sister just casually brings it up, and I'm like, whoa, whoa, nope, nope.  I got to show you something.  I got to...  And they're like, I think, 11, 12 years old.  Oh, these kids.  They're all making their own videos, trying it.  Yeah.  I didn't know that was going on.  We only had to do that, you know, when you hyperventilate, and then somebody picks you up, 
[02:26:30]  and squeezes your chest and picks you up off the ground, and you pass out.  I didn't do any of that stuff.  No, I didn't do that.  I knew there were kids that, because I used to, ironically enough, when I was growing up,  I lived in a house where behind us, the landlord had his garage, which he stored his air conditioning  and heating equipment in because he ran an air conditioning and heating company.  See, I was destined for that.  Right.  And there were those tanks of Freon, old tanks of Freon.  Oh, sure.  Back there.  And all the neighborhood kids would come by and get the last few psh, psh out of it. 
[02:27:00]  A Freon?  And just breathe it in, yeah.  What would that do to you?  It would fuck you up.  But in what way?  Light headiness?  Yeah, you get dizzy.  You try it?  You pass out.  No, never, never.  Never tried that one.  I don't think it's so much the effect of Freon as the effect that it's taking up space in  your lungs where air is supposed to be.  Right.  So you're kind of suffocating, and you get like a feeling of suffocation.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  So that's what they were doing in my yard. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  Yeah.  But we didn't have, you know, we just had those wacky games where you'd do that or smack  someone on the back of the, between the shoulder blades real hard so they would lose  their breath.  Right.  People, I...  People would do the bag hyperventilating thing, right?  I remember that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You take your little brown lunch bag and put it across your mouth and nose and just keep  breathing until you fell on the table.  And then everyone else would laugh.  Yeah.  All right.  Is Otto here?  Yes.  All right.  Good.  We'll take a break. 
[02:28:00]  We got Otto from Otto and George next.  Stay there.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Channel.  Introducing Anthony Cumia's Guide to Casino Blackjack.  Courteous Gambling.

[02:29:30]  We're back on.  We're back on.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  From Otto and George, it's pigroast.tv. 
[02:30:00]  Good morning.  That's where he's at these days.  Good morning.  Thanks for having me on.  Okay, take care.  I'll see you guys.  All right.  Get home safe.  Thanks for coming.  You're among friends, Otto.  Thank you.  Thank you.  See another guy, though, that realizes that's where the f***ing future is.  The future.  The future.  Yes.  It's f***ing on the computers.  What?  The internet?  Yes.  I thought that was a fact.  You could say f*** and everything.  It's great.  It's nice.  No, but it's a good...  Production values are going up.  They're looking bad.  It's looking better.  Look at... 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, you got, like, a great-looking show there, man.  Yeah, man.  Look at that.  It's colorful.  There's broads.  Beautiful girls.  Yeah, the hoos.  We recently did a segment with the stars of Rescue, Inc., those biker guys from Howard  Beach.  Yeah, yeah.  They go to crack houses and save dogs.  Animals?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and we interviewed them, and then we did a sketch where Chips Cooney wanted to get  a dog, and he asked if any of the dogs were allergic to peanut butter, so that the two  big guys came and beat the s*** out of them and threw them into a dog kennel.  So it's a funny sketch. 
[02:31:00]  And then I interviewed Louis Black, and that's going to be on tomorrow's show.  Oh, wow.  After nine.  Louis was very kind to come and do the show.  Is that a lot of energy?  Good egg.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  William in New Jersey.  Hey, this is Tolls.  Yeah, those crazy fingers.  I'd love to smash his fingers and watch him not be able to talk.  Like, I want to sit on his hands and watch him just go, like, well, it's nice to be here.  I mean, he's the king of doing that, you know, week in review type s***, so he's awesome. 
[02:31:30]  He was good, right?  Yeah.  Nobody's the only one who's said no to me so far is Nick DiPaolo.  But that's because I approached him wrong.  I had my manager call him instead of me calling him directly.  Oh, directly?  Yeah, and then it's much easier to just beg off and say no.  Yeah, that's true.  I think if I had spoken directly to him.  So call him.  Yeah, but I haven't written him off.  I just figured I'd get him next year.  What's he doing?  One of the funniest f***ing things I saw was you and Florentine sitting at that picnic table with George and just bullshitting about stuff. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  It was f***ing great, man.  Yeah, that's my back porch.  Oh, that's your back porch?  They were all out of bed, shoot it, and then kicked him out and go back to bed.  It was really good.  You two were f***ing...  I was laughing my balls off watching that.  Really good.  Let's play the clip.  Thanks, Ant.  I'm hoping for a second appearance, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Invite back onto the pig roast.  Yes.  Of course, Jim.  Yeah, I have to go on with a jersey.  It's f***ing...  I know, but it's...  You know me.  I f***ing...  I head eastbound the first opportunity I get, and I never look back.  Yeah.  I know. 
[02:32:30]  We do these things for people.  I know what you mean.  Shut up, Jimmy!  We do these things.  Like, today, I've got to stay for a f***ing meeting, and I don't want it.  I don't want to go to Brooklyn.  I've got to tape...  My friend's got to...  That thing you've got to do in Brooklyn.  A radio thing, yeah.  You've got that thing?  You're like Woody Allen.  You need pavement and bus fumes to feel like.  To feel...  You guys using Vimeo?  What is Vimeo?  Vimeo's a good site, man.  Why are you on Vimeo?  What's Vimeo?  I thought it was the pig roast.tv.  Bash Box TV is the company. 
[02:33:00]  It's on a few.  It's on a few sites.  Yeah.  Which is good.  You've got to diversify.  Put it on YouTube and all that shit, right?  Yeah.  I was watching you on YouTube yesterday doing a rant about Subway sandwiches.  Oh, I hate them.  Yeah, how disgusting, you know, with the black olives.  They are gross, right?  I hate black olives.  That you can't tell the ham from the bologna.  They all look the same.  Yeah, I never understood why would anyone go to a place like that, especially around here  where you could go to a real deli.  Get to a blimpy.  And get, like, fucking a blimpy.  It's vile.  Blimpy's are good. 
[02:33:30]  It's vile with specks of fat on that disgusting...  They smell like body odor in fucking Subway stores.  Wow.  Oh, va-va-voom.  Wow.  Yeah.  Didn't you meet Liz, Anthony?  Didn't Liz come to your house?  Or...  Oh, no.  She went to...  No, I met her.  You met her, right?  Oh, I should have treated her better.  Okay.  Damn.  I threw her calendar in the fucking parking lot.  Sorry, Otto.  Nothing against you.  You did?  She was forcing a calendar on me.  Oh, really?  And then I just wanted to make the people I was with laugh. 
[02:34:00]  She's a little pushy?  I'm sorry.  So what did you do?  You threw the calendar out?  I'm sorry.  I'm a little pushy.  Knowing she was going to walk the same way I did and see her calendar in the street, I thought  it'd be funny.  I'm sorry.  Really?  That's fine.  It has nothing against you and pigrose.tv.  Trust me.  No, that's the way you are, man.  No, pigrose.tv.  That's the way you are.  Well, Sam was there.  She was a little pushy.  Yeah.  She went from introducing me as one of the girls on your show to, when can I be on your  show?  Oh.  And I'm just like, how about we just...  What?  Don't blow up my spot.  Me and Otto are tight. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  No, no, no.  We're tight.  But you told her you'd call her next time Otto was going to be on, so that way the two  of them could come up.  Oh, yeah.  She was supposed to come in with you today.  Oh, really?  Well, that's what I promised her at the time, just to get her off my fucking back.  Shit, I would have called her.  Oh, I thought you said you were going to call her.  Now, she's pretty hot.  Honestly, though, she's really hot.  She is, right?  Yes, she's hot.  But annoying after a while.  Wow, so you're admitting this.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, good.  She's grating.  I was a little scared. 
[02:35:00]  It just came up.  I don't understand why I threw her calendar down.  Yeah, she's always with the feather bowler and the cheap cologne.  I just want to punch her in the face.  I don't think that would be an enjoyable thing, having a girl dance around you, but  it's not.  I think some women don't understand that when they open their mouths, sometimes they're  really unattractive.  But they don't see that for some reason.  She gave me the calendar, and I'm like, all right, cool.  And I'm like, wow, a calendar of hot broads. 
[02:35:30]  But then she had a seat.  I would sit there and point out every month she was in.  Oh, really?  I'm like, I'll find out for myself.  Yeah.  And she goes, as you can tell, that's me too.  Yeah.  And then the girl that was supposed to do June, well, she was sick, so I did her month  as well.  That's great.  I don't want your life story, Bateman.  She's like, when are you going to have me on the show?  I'm like, I don't even know yet.  Wow.  I don't even know if Otto likes you.  I have to wait to see if Otto likes you.  I'm her way to the middle with nothing.  Right. 
[02:36:00]  Black olives don't rule, Wade.  Oh.  I hate black olives.  I like green olives.  Black olives are fucking terrible.  I like the Greek salad olives, that purple colorish olive.  Yeah.  Love those.  I'm not the olive guy.  Black olives suck.  Greek olives.  They're good.  Subway sandwiches are fucking hideous.  I hate them.  I really do despise Subway sandwiches.  As in Subway, the company?  I don't like them at all.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks to me too prefab.  It's like a prefab house.  Yeah, it's prefabricated sandwich.  I want a blimpy.  I like watching somebody fucking cut the meat.  It's gotta be. 
[02:36:30]  You gotta be like, can I have a ham and Swiss and slice the ham fucking tissue paper thin,  please?  That's what I like.  Specific.  I like these chunks of fucking ham.  Like you said, it looks just like the turkey that looks like the bologna that looks like  fucking...  Jimmy wants his sandwich to look like pussy.  Sloppy.  Yeah, messy.  You want your sandwich to look sloppy.  Yeah.  They're like, it's gotta have 3.6 slices of fucking this on it.  It's a meal that you feel, after you eat, you go, why the fuck did I just eat that?  There's no reason to put that in my body.  It's disgusting.  I hate when they weigh your sandwich. 
[02:37:00]  Weigh it?  There used to be some German guy at the corner deli who would throw a fucking, a whole piece  of ham on there.  Bam!  It's fucking thick.  You're like, what?  Even I would look at the sandwich and go, why is this guy wasting so much fucking meat?  They want to make sure you're not getting away with anything?  Yeah.  There's a place called Town Sub in New Brunswick.  Yeah.  Across from New Brunswick High School.  It's the fucking best subs on the planet.  Why, though?  It's nice.  I don't know.  It was just fresh.  It was a family, like a lady and her husband.  Like, it's always fresh. 
[02:37:30]  It looks clean there.  Yeah, they've had the business for years and stuff, you know?  The bread's fresh.  Ooh, nice.  Fresh.  Real fucking bread.  Even the Subway's bread is like fucking, they bake it there.  Yeah.  And they make it sound like, oh, we bake it here and it's good.  You're not a bread baking place or a bread baking place.  It's inauthentic shit.  It stinks.  Yeah.  I hate a, I hate a subway.  I want a good Kaiser roll.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And somebody that speaks English, too.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not some fucking.  Can't find the English these days, Otto.  No.  Not in New York.  Less and less English.  I know.  When I used to street perform as a kid, most people speak, I don't think I can do my act 
[02:38:00]  now, unless you do a dumb act, you know, like a juggler, you know, that you don't need  to communicate.  Purely visual.  Yeah.  You know, if you stop nine out of ten people in Manhattan, right now, you know, only about  three of them will speak English.  Yeah.  And they wouldn't even, or the ones that do wouldn't even speak the language necessary  to pick up on subtle stuff, you know?  I remember how frightening it was driving into the city when I was, I just got my license.  Like, the language barrier, unless they have a perfect grasp, they would miss the subtlety 
[02:38:30]  of, like, your mother's cunt den.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My refined drollery would escape them.  A cock!  I'm sorry, Jimmy, I didn't know you were a cunt.  Your mother's cunt den.  I didn't mean to keep going.  I was actually done.  You guys want to see this clip of Otto on his back porch?  I interrupted the answer.  I don't feel good.  Oh, I don't either.  Yeah, I don't think we can make our meeting.  No, I was driving to the city, and you would stop and say, like, hey, how do you get to 
[02:39:00]  whatever street, and then...  Practice!  That's what I would say.  That's Carnegie Hall.  Terrible.  And, like, somebody would turn around and be like...  Yeah.  There was some dumb fucking language that isn't English.  Yeah.  And it was almost frightening.  Like, because growing up on Long Island, especially in Suffolk County, everyone spoke English  back then.  Yeah.  There was no foreigners.  Like, they expect you to, like, know Turkish just for that fucking moment.  Yeah.  I love their taffy. 
[02:39:30]  My mother always said, Chip, they're invading this country.  Yeah?  What'd she mean by they?  People who don't talk to English.  The same people that bed her down on the kitchen floor?  They was helping her.  They was helping her.  All linemen from the Jets.  Football players, big and black, helping her.  Oh, jeez.  Remember you told that casual Freon story?  Yeah.  We got a guy.  He will not go away, because his friend inhaled Freon and died.  Yeah, it kills you.  Of course.  Did we get that message out there? 
[02:40:00]  He inhaled it without a fucking can?  You want to see what happened?  See what happened.  Because you told that story as a throwaway, and maybe people will try that shit.  And there was the gas part of Freon, where if you stood the can up so the valve was on  top, it was Freon gas.  You ever mix angel dust and Freon?  You're crazy, but you're cool.  Cool.  When you turn it upside down, you get liquid Freon.  And if you try to inhale the liquid Freon, you would freeze your fucking whole thing. 
[02:40:30]  Wow, is that what kills you?  And you would die.  How long does it take to thaw out?  Your body's hot.  A matter of seconds, but it would destroy the cells.  The cells would just freeze and burst.  Oh my God.  Yeah, terrible.  Is that what happens?  They burst your cells?  Yeah.  Whenever cells freeze, they die because they crack open.  Like something that has water in it, and the water freezes.  It expands it.  It just busts open the cell structure.  How damaging are those people that inhale spray paint into a rag?  Oh, yeah.  That's got to be really bad.  Again, it's always these Spanish guys. 
[02:41:00]  Whenever I've seen it on Cops, it's always these Spanish guys.  They've got silver paint around their mouths, and they're all lethargic trying to tell the  cop they're not doing anything.  Yeah.  Dummies.  Giving fellatio to the tin man.  You can have that one, Chip.  Thank you.  I'd say that.  But I would say fellatio, too, because you've got to keep it high, Brow.  One time, my mother heard me curse, and I was like, he sucked his cock.  She's like, Chip, I don't talk like that.  Sucked his cock.  Sucked his cock.  Fucked his cock.  Sucked his cock.  Here's Scott's Freon story. 
[02:41:30]  Scott.  Hey, Scott.  Scott, you're waiting an hour.  You're right.  Scott's Freon.  Get it Scott's Freon.  Hey, Scott, you're on the air.  You're on the air.  Guy whose friend died because he inhaled Freon.  Go.  My friend didn't die.  Holy shit.  Yeah, how you doing?  What's your name?  Scott.  Yeah, Scott.  Hi, Scott.  We've been talking to you for three minutes.  I took my Bluetooth off and ready.  Oh, boy.  Anyway.  He's got a good phone.  Are you high or something? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, this guy's so high, he's like a bunch of kites.  A friend of mine, he was trying to get cheap highs, like back in the late 70s, early 80s,  during the summer.  And he was inhaling Freon out of his dad's pickup truck from the air conditioning system  in the pickup truck.  Wow.  And it froze his lungs.  Oh.  He literally suffocated and died around the front lawn, like the whole fucking neighborhood.  How long did it take him to die? 
[02:42:30]  It took about two or three minutes.  Wow.  I wasn't there, but I heard all about it.  Was he gasping for breath or did he pass out?  He was gasping for breath.  It was like he was drowning, basically.  Oh, man.  He inhaled it, and it just froze his lungs.  It just froze right up.  He couldn't get any air into his lungs, because they were frozen.  What an idiot.  Jesus.  I know.  He got a real good shot of it, and it just basically just iced the tubes, you know? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Supposedly, you're supposed to just huff the gas part of Freon.  Liquid will kill you instantly.  The gas will kill you, though, too.  You just fucking get...  Oh, yeah.  Your brain won't get oxygen, because it's getting fucking Freon.  I don't think that's how it's supposed to be in your lungs.  Here's something ironic.  Freon is expensive.  Yeah.  He was a little leavening, and he probably ran out of pot. 
[02:43:30]  He was like, how else do I get high?  Humorous side note.  It's not even Freon anymore.  It is just called refrigerant, because Freon is outlawed now because of fluorocarbons.  So could you do anything with that shit?  I'd probably get you high, too.  I don't know.  I think anything that isn't oxygen, that cannot oxygenate your blood, will give you a buzz.  You know, right before you drop dead.  Even nitrogen.  You know, you huff that, you're going to get a buzz.  You're going to get that tunnel vision. 
[02:44:00]  You're visioning, whoa, my brain is dying.  Hey, I see Joan Rivers in the shade 45.  Joan Rivers?  What's she doing over there?  She's done every show here except ours.  Except ours.  She won't do the show.  She's taking some big black cock in there right now.  A lot of women won't do this show.  It's got something to do with Howard.  And I don't know if it's his fault, or they're just afraid of displeasing him.  You get scared that Howard's going to get mad if they do our show.  Lisa Lampanelli, absolutely.  That's the reason why.  None of them will.  None of them.  So stupid.  Here she comes.  Way to be edgy.  Oh, boy.  I love Joan Rivers, too, man. 
[02:44:30]  Love her, love her.  Yeah, I saw that documentary.  I fucking love Joan Rivers, man.  Yeah.  She just doesn't stop.  I think if she stops, she's going to drop dead.  As a stand-up, she's fucking as harsh as anybody working.  We've talked about the documentary.  I felt sorry for her.  You did?  After all these years, she's traveling to these shitty places still.  Yeah.  Because she's a workaholic.  It seems like she's afraid to stop moving.  Yeah, if she stops, she's going to fucking die.  Like, it's two in the morning.  She's going to call.  Oh, when are we getting home?  Yeah, yeah.  She's fucking a nap.  I think she was in some just shitty casino in the middle of nowhere, and you're thinking, 
[02:45:00]  you're Joan Rivers.  You don't have to take every one of these gigs at this point.  Yeah.  But she does for whatever reason.  I don't know.  Well, same with Rickles.  Why is she still working?  Because he gets enjoyment out of it.  That's why I'm making a 50 G's a show or whatever it is they make.  It's like...  Yeah, but what do you do with the 50 G's if you already have enough money?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they enjoy it.  Yeah, they like it.  And I think it is like Otto said.  They think if they stop for a second, that's it.  They're done.  And by watching their friends that have, that drop dead, I think they're right.  Yeah, you will die. 
[02:45:30]  I mean, what's he going to do, you know?  Plus, as a comedian, if you're not on stage for a while, you feel like you're vanishing.  I did.  When I was out in L.A. for a while, and I was only getting one spot every week or so,  I felt like I was invisible.  Yeah, yeah.  And I came right back to New York.  I called up all the people that booked me, and I said, I'm coming back.  Let's line up some dates.  I couldn't stand it there.  Where were you going?  I went out there in like the mid-90s.  I just said, I'm fucking...  I gave up my apartment.  I just went out there.  And, you know, I was out there for about five months. 
[02:46:00]  You know, Messina was getting me in at the improv and the comedy store, but it just wasn't  enough.  You couldn't...  You know, there was no living out there.  It's either you're a movie star or you're a waiter.  Or a bum.  Yeah.  It's a bum.  Yeah, it's a factory town.  You gotta be...  You gotta have a show or you're nothing, you know?  It's a very fucking easy place to get depressed and lonely and feel unproductive.  I get fat when I'm in LA.  I hate it.  Yeah.  Like, I like brief period.  We could just get back.  Yeah.  I'm kidding, Jimmy. 
[02:46:30]  You're a sweater cutie butt.  And then a successful comic, like a guy like Bobby Slayton out there feels like he's a loser  because he's not the top guy like Seinfeld.  But, you know, he's like one rung below him on the ladder, but he doesn't...  He feels like he's unsuccessful because he's not a TV star.  I like Bobby, but he's more than one rung below $250 million in syndication.  Well, I mean, yeah, I guess so, but...  But, I mean, how many people are below him on the ladder? 
[02:47:00]  That's all I'm saying.  You know, he has a nice career.  You know, he doesn't do any shit gigs.  Yeah.  It's the same thing with radio.  We were talking about that years ago when we got the boot and you gotta spend time off.  And all you're thinking every day that goes by is, well, that's another day we haven't  been heard.  Yeah.  That people are just finding other things to listen to.  Yeah, it's not like you could stockpile stuff because your show is usually about what's  contemporary.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you couldn't, like, just sit and write for future shows, right?  Yeah.  You had no outlet, right?  You just gotta fuck it.  And there wasn't really an outlet on the internet or anything. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  There was nothing going on.  You gotta sit it out and hope that when you come back eventually, people are gonna be  like, oh, I remember those guys.  Yeah.  And not have found something else.  Did you find yourself being more verbally abusive to friends and family during that time  because you didn't have this outlet?  I think you're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would happen.  Destroyed a lot of relationships.  Yeah.  Fuck this.  Fuck you.  I wrote a lot.  That's why I did most of my writing because I didn't have here to get it out.  Yeah.  I just went away.  I just traveled.  Yeah.  I didn't want to be around people.  Yeah.  In general.  Yeah.  I just traveled around. 
[02:48:00]  Fuck him.  Writing was helpful.  Because they all gave you the look like, oh, man.  How's it going?  Hey, how's it going?  You had that amazing career that we all wish we had and now you're a no-book.  You know they're happy.  They're all secretly happy.  Oh, I know.  Oh, yeah.  You motherfuckers.  You find out even people in your own family are happy that you fucking got fucked.  I told you.  That was an amazing time.  People in your family?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Not immediate brothers and sisters.  Oh, okay.  You guys used to be some people, you know, the next rung.  There was a period when you guys were on the cover of every paper like twice, three times 
[02:48:30]  a week.  That's crazy.  It was fucking insane.  Yeah.  You know.  Those days are over.  Bigger than Bernard Getz.  Yes.  Not quite the public service that he did.  One of those guys just died.  Sorry.  James Ramseller.  Really?  Just shot, killed himself.  They think it might have been a drug universe for suicide.  Whoopsie.  One of Bernard Getz's victims who made the pregnant girl.  Another fucking, yeah.  They were bums.  Another fucking creative, great member of society.  They all did shit afterwards.  Terrible people.  Except for the wheelchair-bound one. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  The one who got the spinal thing, right?  Man.  You look okay.  The subway's worked.  You don't look so bad.  Boom.  That was the problem, right?  That last shot.  The judge said you were starting to enjoy yourself at that point.  Yeah.  I think he tried to shoot again and couldn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you should enjoy yourself at that point.  The subway's really fucked up back then.  If you come in and go, I'm going to take care of myself, why not enjoy it?  It's a whole nother time back then.  It was fucking Death Wish back then.  It really was scary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  People can't really understand how fucked up this city was.  Yeah.  Like Central Park, people are like, oh, Central Park. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, no.  You didn't fucking, there were times you went in.  You didn't walk into Central Park?  There were times you got the fuck out of Central Park.  You might have gone on the edge a little bit.  Yeah.  To say you were in it.  Ninth Avenue is like now nice and old restaurants, high-end restaurants.  That's where the whores were.  Yeah.  It used to be if you walked a block in the wrong direction, you'd be in trouble.  You're fucked.  The Javits Center up there by the West Side Highway and the Javits Center was just nasty.  Or 8th Avenue.  I fucking, one time I was wearing my glasses and I blew a guy in a gay theater in a cowboy  hat.  Then I got sick and asked him to beat me up because I had no money. 
[02:50:00]  Didn't I cowboy?  Take my books.  Oh, yeah.  Take my books.  I don't want your damn books.  That's Jackie shit laughing at you.  Yeah, that was some fucking, that was old school.  I like watching movies from back then, though.  Oh, the best.  They show that shot of Times Square where it's the Panasonic sign is wrapping around the building.  Oh, it's fucking great.  Slightly ahead of our time.  And then they got the, every corner had a chock full of nuts on it. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  That was our coffee.  So Starbucks, right?  And there were the buses that.  Steak and brew.  Yeah, steak and brew.  Buses that blew out just black smoke.  Yeah.  That was like gritty shit.  Pimps just walking the fucking streets.  Yeah, actual pimps.  Yeah, real like pimps.  Choking out who is.  Yeah.  Choking them right in the street.  Choking out who is.  Yeah.  For the tourists on schedule.  Yeah.  The 11 o'clock beating.  Yeah.  Next show.  Yeah.  Yeah, with a purple suit loitering in the doorway.  Yeah.  Fucking great.  The good old days.  It's amazing.  It's the same place.  But people would come to New York to see that. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  They would have to see the taxi driver in New York.  Right.  You know, like you go to see, you know, fucking, you know,  Mount Rushmore in whatever state that's in.  You come here to see pimps and fucking degradation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like, remember in Escape from, what was it, Escape from New York?  When Season Hubbly finds her in like a chock full of nuts.  They didn't see chock full of nuts going away when they made that movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just, that was it.  That was fucking the coffee place.  And the big smoke thing coming out of it. 
[02:51:30]  M-O-N-Y.  Money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Abel Farrar in New York.  You know, the bad lieutenant guy and fucking King of New York.  With the big old fucking cabs.  Those bubbly fucking oldie car cabs.  You kind of wonder who actually lived here.  No.  Because we all just visited.  We would take the train in from Long Island.  That's true.  There were a lot of bad areas.  Who the fuck was actually living here day in and day out?  I think unless you were on Upper West Side or like fucking.  No, Upper West Side.  Tough, resilient New Yorkers.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Soho was a fucking ghost town.  There was nothing there.  There was nothing there.  The area me and Jimmy now live a mere 20 years ago was horrible.  Yeah.  Was it?  Yes.  The Mr. Good Bar fucking bar is right there.  Oh, okay.  Really?  That's a true story?  Yeah.  Where's the Good Bar bar?  My allergist, who's a Jewish guy.  Boo!  Sorry.  He pointed out to me.  It's across the street from that Jewish mostly whatever on 72nd Street.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's where the actual bar was for the Mr. Good Bar story. 
[02:52:30]  They used to take us in for fucking field trips from Long Island, man, to go to the Museum  of Natural History.  Or Lincoln Center.  That was it.  And it was just like we'd pull up out of the tunnel and from the tunnel to the museum,  it was nothing but the teachers trying to distract us so we wouldn't look out the window  because everything was just bad to see.  Everything was amazing.  There were fucking like drunks and fights, just people, bums beating the shit out of each  other.  You forget about how many burnt cars were on the side of the road.  Yeah, yeah.  You forget.  Remember that?  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Not just one or two.  People would do this.  The Bowery was really the Bowery.  I mean, it was those shitty bars with 20-cent beers and real winos.  Oh, my God.  But the highways, there were burnt out cars that were picked apart, man.  That's so fucked up.  I was just thinking that this morning.  As I was driving in, there was a car on the side of the parkway off with the lights  off.  And obviously-  Now you completely notice it because it doesn't happen anymore.  It's like that just doesn't.  And I don't mean burnt out or stripped even.  Like those two.  But just cars that were left overnight. 
[02:53:30]  Like you would drive home at night and see like, on your drive home, if you made like  10 exits, you were probably going to see three cars on the side of the road.  I think it's-  No, that was about the cops looking the other way and saying, all right, give me the keys.  Do you think?  Because there was no one there.  Absolutely.  I think-  Cops used to work with you when you were drinking and driving.  I think it used to be Dewey's and people would pull over, lock their car and get arrested.  I think it was a little of everything.  I think it's the cell phone now.  I think it was also some of the cops also-  Drug driving wasn't even illegal in like the 50s and 60s. 
[02:54:00]  No, people just kind of, all right, I'll let you go.  What was it?  Make sure you make it home.  Don't hit anybody.  I won't be fine to the luxury again tonight.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  I want less government, but what the fuck were they thinking?  Yeah.  That's true.  I don't think this drinking and driving is a problem.  Some easy shit.  Holy fuck, that was a no-brainer one.  I think, though, because everyone has cell phones, if something happens to your car or  even a cop pulls you over or something like that, you can make that call quick and have 
[02:54:30]  someone get your car.  And back then, your car just had to kind of sit there until you reached the phone or fucking  sobered up or something.  Yeah.  I don't know why there's just not cars on the side of highways anymore.  It's just a weird thing.  Yeah, or dead hookers rolled up in carpets like Pam Greer.  Pam Greer.  Yeah, they rolled that bitch up.  Boy, she was a mean one.  With that razor blade.  That was a nasty movie.  Those guys were so bad guys.  Oh, for Apache the Bronx, was it?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a good movie.  Fucking Danny Aiello throws that guy off the roof laughing at him.  Yeah, laughing. 
[02:55:00]  Horrible precinct that was.  Oh, where's that?  That's the West Side Highway.  That's 1977.  That's 77 World Trade Center right behind him.  There's a guy just sleeping on a lounge chair on the side there next to a car.  Wait a minute.  Damn, that's the West Side Highway, dude.  Right.  It used to actually come out of the ground like that.  That's where you would drive every day past the Trade Center and you'd see the hotel in  between them.  Wow.  That's the West Side Highway.  I'm so confused.  Where's my perspective?  Dude.  Let's see.  You're coming out of the Battery Tunnel and you make a right. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, so we're heading up.  You're looking uptown.  You're looking uptown.  Trade Center was on the right.  What's all on the left?  Just nice parks now, right?  That's what Battery Park is now.  And that's the water.  That's the river to the left.  Oh, yeah.  There's a shitload of buildings now to the left.  Oh, yeah.  They put landfill in there and built that.  That's why I built the whole movie studio there where they filmed Lore and Order.  There's a whole fucking sober cup studio.  Oh, is it landfill?  I didn't realize.  That's why.  They built onto the landfill.  This is such a visual.  That's why I was confused because the water's right there.  I'm like, wait, this doesn't make sense.  They put landfill in and there's a whole other community over there. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  All that.  The financial center is over there.  The American Express Center is on that side.  That's why I was confused.  Look at the L.  There's a fucking L running right past there and shit.  There's a movie called Shakedown that had Peter Weller and Sam Elliott that was made  back then that really shows the grime of 42nd Street brilliantly.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a shit movie, but it's great to see that footage.  But I love those fucking movies like that.  It just shows New York.  Huggy Bear's in it.  It's called Shakedown.  Huggy Bear. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Huggy Bear.  Mean Streets, too, right?  Getting back to the car thing.  My dad's no longer with us, so I think I'm safe.  He used to fucking get rid of cars like you'd get rid of a dead...  That's what people did.  What, just abandoned them?  Just dumped a car.  All of a sudden, we go, where are you going?  And he goes, ah, don't worry about it.  Oh.  And next thing you know, he comes back without the family car.  Why would he do that?  Why would he do that?  A, he was getting a new car, and B, probably, honestly, to collect on the insurance money.  Oh, say it was stolen?  Oh, I got you. 
[02:57:00]  I don't know.  Yeah.  But he would dump these cars.  Yeah.  And I guess there were spots all over New York City that dumped them.  He would go all the way in.  And then maybe, I don't know exactly.  That's kind of what he did.  That's borderline criminal, but what the fuck?  Well, yeah, yeah.  But we were dirt poor, so he did whatever the fuck he could.  You have to get by.  But all of a sudden, he would just leave the car somewhere and come home.  I don't remember how you were legitimately supposed to get rid of a junk car back then.  Like, call the junkyard?  Yeah.  What do you do?  You just dumped it.  But fast forward.  Oh, Lamont. 
[02:57:30]  Fast forward a couple decades, the second half of the story, his brain wasn't as good.  He wasn't as sharp.  Right.  And he started dumping our cars right up the street.  Really?  Yeah, my brother tells a classic story where he's driving with his friends, and there's  our old family car in the parking lot, right up 25A, in this parking lot.  They didn't use much, just rotting away.  And his friends are like, isn't that your fucking car?  That's hysterical.  And my brother's had it kind of like, I don't know.  I don't know what you're talking about.  But we all saw it. 
[02:58:00]  Getting out of the ice shot, at least.  Yeah, right?  Get back to the couch.  I am telling you, it was two to three miles from our house and just sat there for years.  Wow.  Years.  Sam, find more pictures of-  Man.  That's crazy.  That West Side Highway project they did is amazing.  It's beautiful now.  Yeah, I didn't realize.  It's fucking two lanes going each way with a median strip of trees and plants in there  and shit.  It's not even-  It's amazing what they did.  Oh, look at the broads.  Look at the chippies.  What's that?  An old GTO behind them.  That's fucking-  That's a hot picture right there. 
[02:58:30]  Find a good one, man.  And you don't have those Yo Check It Out guys in Times Square now.  Oh, yeah.  I got girls upstairs.  Check it out.  Flip the car.  I got girls upstairs.  Vegas.  Making noises with the cars.  The guys in Vegas know how to make those cars sing, though.  Oh, yeah?  Fuck his ass.  There's a pattern to it.  Like, they stay-  I don't know.  Whatever.  What is this?  Brooklyn Bridge?  That's the 1980 New York Transit strike.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  Turn it to a little bit trees.  Look at all them afros.  Yeah.  A lot of fros, right?  Jesus.  A lot of fros.  Peach colored leisure suits. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  What is that?  Oh, man.  That's the same place.  West Side Highway.  Wow.  Let me look at that.  What?  That's from 1975.  It's when they-  They're starting to put the dirt in to build on.  And people were dumping cars there.  They would just dump cars there.  Yeah.  Is there a-  The Battery Park City landfill, 1975, with-  Some of them are abandoned cars.  See?  I told you.  This is what was going on when I was growing up.  People just fucking found a place to abandon their cars.  Could you imagine walking those streets at night? 
[02:59:30]  Like, the riffraff that must have been on that fucking street then.  Oh, I would have loved it.  I would have loved to film that shit.  Fuck.  If you wouldn't have got far with your camera, they probably would have taken it.  Yeah.  You're right.  The blonde guy with a magical device in his hand.  You'd have to go out with Paul Kersey.  Yeah.  Paul Kersey will save you.  Yeah.  How do you like your liver?  Medium.  Medium.  How do you like your liver?  Yeah.  He gives his son-in-law the liver, and the son-in-law's all fucked up.  Yeah.  He's blasting the music. 
[03:00:00]  He's enjoying himself now because he's killing people.  What are you so happy about, Pop?  What do you want me to do?  Moan and groan for the rest of my life?  That's great.  Moan and groan.  He's happy because he's plugging people now.  Yeah.  He's shitting people.  He's all fucking full of piss and vinegar.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I love that movie, though.  It's so funny.  They got increasingly worse and worse as the series went on.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The first one was just funny as fuck to watch.  Oh, the first one was awesome.  It's great, and it's bad, and it's fucking... 
[03:00:30]  It's just real enough that you get into it, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was kind of a B movie.  But he did start off as a nonviolent guy, and then becomes the...  You know, in every other Bronson movie, he's the baddest guy on earth from real one to real  ten, you know?  In that one, he, like, vomits when he kills the first mugger and shit, you know?  It's awesome.  I like the fact that he...  I was laughing at the fact that he goes to Arizona.  Yeah.  That guy out there from fucking Love American Style. 
[03:01:00]  Every episode of Love American Style.  Yeah.  Gives him a gun.  Stuart Margolin, yeah.  He gives him a gun, and he's just able to pack it in his bag and take it on the plane  and fucking...  That's true, yeah.  He gets back to...  With a box of bullets with a nice wrapping paper on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was hilarious.  I was like, what the fuck?  Oh, man.  Look at that.  40-second string.  Sam, I can't see you.  Sam's hugging it.  Damn.  Nice.  I love that.  Look at those.  Wow.  That was some badass shit right there.  Triple features. 
[03:01:30]  42nd and what?  Broadway.  That's between 7th and 8th.  I want to see Ghetto Freak.  Ghetto Freak.  Ghetto Freak.  Yeah.  Wow.  And what does that say?  Look at the guy's pants in the middle of the street looking back.  What a 70s fucking outfit.  Oh, yeah.  Is that like 72?  Yeah.  That looks like the beginning of The Odd Couple.  Kenny's wearing those colors today.  Yeah, he is.  He is.  He's got the yellow shirt on and the mold.  Yeah, light brown and sickly eye yellow.  Yeah.  What street is this?  42nd and what?  42nd and Broadway.  Broadway and 8th.  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  Now on stage.  Girls, girls, girls.  Well, there's still two movie theaters there.  Yeah.  Three hard new adult features.  There were about 10 operating movie theaters then.  I used to play hooky from school.  Oh, Otto.  But if you got there before noon, you could get in for a buck.  Nice.  They would open at 9 a.m.  So for a buck, you could see a triple feature.  You ever watched the triple feature?  Yeah.  Wow.  I loved it.  Let the record state that Josh has officially tapped out.  He's had enough action for one day.  Oh, yeah.  He's now texting and tweeting. 
[03:02:30]  He's sexting.  Oh.  Yeah.  He's sexting.  He's part of the action.  Yeah.  He was.  I think he got enough out of his prize.  What happened?  Otto, he won a prize.  What did you win?  It's costing anywhere between $2,000 and $2,500 for him to sit in that seat.  Why?  Costing who?  Him.  Or his family.  Oh, you're donating money to something?  Well, yes.  Sort of.  Oh, nice.  Okay.  Cool.  Sorry I couldn't be a better guest. 
[03:03:00]  He was part of an auction.  Yeah.  Tomorrow, Sting will be here.  Today, Otto.  Oh, wow.  We don't have Sting for real, do we?  No.  No.  You're asking me?  Yeah.  You look like you should be having your way with Ned Beatty on a pile of wet leaves.  Look at that fucking beard.  Grabbing him by the nostrils and making him squeal.  No.  No, just kidding.  No, you look good.  What movie is that?  It looks like you have a toothache. 
[03:03:30]  What movie's playing there?  Clint.  Clint Eastwood.  So it might be Clint Eastwood.  There's a J.  Joe Kidd.  Oh, Josie Wells.  Josie Wells.  How about Josie Wells?  Was it?  You think it was Josie Wells?  Oh, no.  I see a J.  It's Joe Kidd.  Oh, Joe Kidd.  1972.  Is that from 72?  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Flame State.  Nice.  Look at that.  He's been a little star for a long time.  Ganado, nice.  There he has.  Look at that fucking street.  That looks like Caroline's would be like here.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:04:00]  To the right, looking down.  Okay.  Oh, that's looking down Broadway.  Yeah.  And the smog.  Look at the smog on this street.  It's like, you don't see that anymore.  Yeah, look at all these different cars driving down.  Not a potted plant in the middle of the road, but that fucking fruit mayor.  Her honor.  Those two would definitely have been shot.  What road is that?  Of course they were.  Where is that?  That looks like a ninth, eighth?  Where is that?  Man, that's fucked up.  If you fell asleep in the movie theater, they would sit next to you and cut your pocket open 
[03:04:30]  with a razor blade and take your money out.  I've seen guys do it there.  Really?  Yeah, they would take their time to not wake you and cut your pocket open.  That's nice.  And if you were sitting forward of where the balcony came to an end, you'd get a large root  beer thrown in your head just because you were a white guy.  You'd just go, oh, these are nice seats.  Boosh.  Did that ever happen to you?  Oh, yeah.  Giant root beer.  It's very sticky.  My root beer, though.  Yeah, it's the most sticky, I guess. 
[03:05:00]  You're going to root beer throw on you?  Oh, yeah.  The most sticky.  They thought it out.  I'd give anything to have one.  They weren't that expensive.  Yeah, they thought it out.  Well, no, we've got to go root beer.  I'd like to see that more than anything with fucking hot lead.  Yeah.  That's classic.  It was the most sticky.  Especially if it was movie one of the triple feature and you're settling in.  Oh, God.  You've got to sit there.  Young hooky player.  Yeah.  Well, ready for the new Death Wish?  Let's go wash your fucking stupid neck off in the bathroom. 
[03:05:30]  Get your puppet hand all sticky.  Fucking creep.  Now playing the Filthy Five.  Oh, and I love that.  The Filthy Five.  The Filthy Five.  Promiscuous sex.  Oh, shit.  God, old porn theaters.  That was the New York that was so scary.  You come in from Long Island and just walk around Times Square in amazement.  Just like, holy fuck, what is this world?  So cool.  Wow.  It'd be cool to see, right?  Yeah.  Imagine waking up and having your pockets cut.  You're like, oh.  Oh, my God.  Imagine waking up while it's being done. 
[03:06:00]  They would pickpocket your ass off.  They would do it.  It would take them an hour.  They would just sit there.  And if you stirred it all, they would just go back to watching the movie.  I would watch guys do that, you know?  I wouldn't alert the victim.  The guy's holding a ring.  Didn't you have your wallet in the back pocket?  How would they get it done?  Oh, the train.  I don't know.  I guess they would see a bulge.  They'd see something in there, you know?  How awful was it when you fucking spend an hour and you pull out a pack of gum or fucking  like $1 with something wrapped in it? 
[03:06:30]  Take the blade and slit his throat and walk out.  Yeah, exactly.  The trains, just with all that fucking graffiti.  Yeah.  You just don't fucking see that, man.  Sweet boy with a neck full of root beer.  A sweet Danish boy, just eager, very molestable, with his little hat, little performing hat,  and a neck full of root beer.  That's going to make you laugh all day, huh?  Especially his all down the back.  No way to sit and enjoy the film.  Ruined.  It's true.  It's too true.  We are running out of show.  We're not done yet, though. 
[03:07:00]  But I want to make sure we get the plug-in for pigroast.tv and possibly play a clip.  You want to play the porch clip?  Will that sell the show a little bit for you there, Otto?  Yeah, big A's on it a lot.  Pigroast.tv.  Everybody's linking.  And also, you got a gig, Otto?  Hold on.  You got a gig, too, right?  Yeah.  Orchards?  Is that?  I got a bunch of gigs.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, whatever's on my website. 
[03:07:30]  I'm just a little disoriented right now.  I was supposed to do a gig with Levy and Mick Foley, the wrestler.  Yeah, we didn't come all the hell out of there.  Yeah, not enough tickets were sold, so Levy put me in this place called Cha-Cha's down  in Little Italy.  He's an actor, this old guy.  He was on The Sopranos, the guy who goes,  Why don't you get a bicycle and look at some beach pussy?  He says to, what's his name, Frank Vincent?  Yeah.  You were selling laser printers out of your Crown Vic.  That guy.  That's Cha-Cha.  Yeah.  So you had a gig down there instead. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, weird place.  So what happened?  Mick Foley didn't sell tickets?  Levy panicked.  It was like Monday.  Oh, shit.  He didn't get, there weren't enough calls, so he switched the date, and then he calls  me Friday.  He goes, can you still come up to Albany?  It's like three in the afternoon.  No.  Albany is the fucking, I'm going to say this, it's the fucking worst marketer.  The market in the country.  Wow.  Comedy it is.  Wow.  Some guys might draw up there.  Yeah.  I do terrible up there.  Really?  Fucking hate it. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  I don't hate the people.  As a market, it's a fucking, nah, they're usually good.  No, they're S.  But I absolutely hate Albany.  They're good, there's just not enough of them.  You weren't going to work for Tom, right?  I did his club, I never drew there.  I do Queensberry, I don't draw there.  Queensberry.  Stinks.  It stinks as a comedy market.  All right, so OttoAndGeorge.com for your dates.  Yeah.  And OttoAndGeorge on Twitter.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So why don't we play this clip from PigRoast.com.  Oh, thank you.  Cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Welcome back, PigRoast viewers. 
[03:09:00]  Happy holidays.  Hope you had holidays were good and you got enough toys and turkey.  Wait, could you back that up a second?  I hope that was good to you.  I want to hear this professional introduction.  Because the tape, there's no ability to stop and reshoot on this.  I stink.  That's funny.  You don't stink.  You're a good boy.  Psychotic Jew with Puppet Enter's Frame.  Okay.  Ready?  Welcome back, PigRoast viewers.  Happy holidays.  Hope you had holidays were good and you got enough poison turkey. 
[03:09:30]  Poison turkey.  Rappy holidays.  I'm happy.  That is a great intro.  Psychotic Jew with Puppet Enter's Frame.  Okay.  Ready?  Welcome back, PigRoast viewers.  Happy holidays.  Hope you had holidays were good.  You got enough toys and turkey.  Hope Santa was good to you.  Oh, toys and turkey.  Merry Christmas.  Happy Hanukkah.  Kwanzaa's and all to everybody.  God bless America.  Death to all Klingons. 
[03:10:00]  Leave that out.  Yeah.  Death to all Klingons.  That's great.  Yeah.  Where did that come from?  Hey.  It's my friend and neighbor, Jim Flarky.  Friend and neighbor.  This is so old school.  Great.  Are you on that show that's on like 5 a.m.?  Yeah.  And looking crystal meth heads and guys getting up to go crop dusting.  See you all.  They run the show like on a loop.  It's on like almost five, six times a day.  It's always on.  Did George get anything for Christmas?  Did he have a list for Santa? 
[03:10:30]  Well, he got an earlier Christmas.  He didn't check it twice, but I had him fixed up.  It was a practical gift.  It wasn't like a fun.  But what was on your list?  Terrible answer.  George.  For Christmas.  I don't really need a lot of gin.  Maybe just an agent that fucking calls me once in a while.  The biggest shit I got working for me is fucking useless.  I asked him to get me on the Jerry Lewis telethon.  He said I couldn't get you on there even if you had the disease.  All right. 
[03:11:00]  We were doing the news now.  It's far too easy.  Did you hear this shit?  They asked Stephen Hawking, the smartest guy in the world, what the greatest mystery in  the universe is of all time.  Mystery in the universe.  And he said women.  Isn't that crazy?  I mean, look, it makes sense.  The guys, who could figure them out?  There's fucking rocket science in America three different times.  You tried to, but.  Fucking Asians that could do calculus in two seconds.  They could put a Rubik's cube together in 30 seconds. 
[03:11:30]  They're dishonest cunts.  You can't live with them.  You can't run in all the little wheelchair.  These bleeding animals.  I don't know what the fuck they want.  They never tell me shit.  I can't feel my cock.  All right.  The only way I get hard is through rigor mortis.  I'm dying.  I'm shitting my pants now.  Stephen Hawking.  George, what do you think?  Can you figure out women?  Stephen Hawking.  Oh, God.  I don't even talk to them.  I go.  Who cares?  Look at the tits.  Look at the cunt.  Look at the ass.  Ha ha.  Yeah, sure. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, really?  You're buying shoes?  Yeah.  Suck my cock.  Suck my cock.  Suck my cock.  Suck my cock.  Suck my cock.  All right.  That was hilarious.  Okay, what do you got?  Speaking of cocks, Chaz Bono's in the news.  She's trying to save up enough money to buy a new cock.  Why couldn't I be in a universe where I never get to hear that fucking name again?  Chaz Donor is, Chaz Donor that.  It's you, Michael Cagliari.  What does she want to cock now? 
[03:12:30]  Hey, give her a cock.  Get her out.  In an artist store.  Here's a cock.  George, would you fuck her?  With the cock or without the cock?  There's nothing left to that animal.  There's nothing there.  It's a scraped out cunt slap on a fat fuck that looks like Chris Penn.  There isn't enough liquor in Ireland.  That's where I would liquor, in Ireland.  There's a cunt and her asshole are gone. 
[03:13:00]  Brad Pitt?  Yeah.  Brad knows he was seen in public walking with a cane this week.  On further inspection, he was just holding hands with Angelina Jolie.  I don't find her track with those creepy fish lips on her.  She's all fucking skinny.  You're a fucker and you cut yourself.  You need a tourniquet.  Pull your father, you ungrateful cunt.  The guy's a legend.  He was a midnight cowboy.  Pick up the phone, you fucking selfish whore.  Drop the baby and call your dad. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  Maverick's guard Del Monte West was...  He is a legend.  I love John Boy.  Deliverance?  George, you wouldn't bang Angelina Jolie?  I would not bang her.  No, even with those lips, you wouldn't do a blowjob.  No, I wouldn't bang her, Jim Florentine.  I would not bang her.  He wouldn't take a blowjob.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, a three dollar...  Wrap those three dollar lips around my two dollar cock, you cunt, and call your father. 
[03:14:00]  Don't rhyme.  Doesn't have to.  It's a celebrity week and the price is right.  Terrible laugh track.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's crazy.  Who's Harry?  He loves porn.  Yeah, he's addicted to porn at one point.  He's buying like thousands of dollars.  He's addicted to porn?  He's addicted to porn.  All right.  How do you know?  Do you and George ever watch porn together?  George, you watch it with Otto?  Yeah, yeah.  I like that new 3D porno movie coming at you in 3D. 
[03:14:30]  Money shot.  Duck.  You know, it's weird, George, you got a wooden cock.  Do you use hand cream when you jerk off or you don't have to?  No, Jim Florentine.  I go raw.  You ever got smoke off your cock from rubbing it to your heart?  Are you trying to get a slack or sandpaper joke out of me?  Don't fuck yourself.  He ain't doing it.  There he is.  I know you're going.  There's a rock.  I'm not going to go all out of this. 
[03:15:00]  Celebrity week on The Price is Right.  And when asked during the bullseye game how much a set of anal beads goes for,  Neil Patrick Harris said,  17, 53, and one.  Fucking one.  George, you ever had anything in your ass?  Anal beads?  George, have you ever had any...  Sorry, I'm not used to two fucking horrible straight men. 
[03:15:30]  Ask me again.  Anything you were asking for?  This is a very personal question.  Oh, now all of a sudden, now George is sensitive too.  You can't ask him anything.  He's not going PC.  Nothing in your...  You never had a finger in your ass?  One time I had a Ronco, Norelco, triple-headed shather shoved up my ass,  and I liked it so much, I bought the company. 
[03:16:00]  The tight shots on George's face.  Thanks for watching.  Thanks for seeing you guys.  Jim's got to go home and take his baby and feed him and stuff,  so thanks for coming by.  Yeah, man.  No problem.  We love the metal show.  Watch the metal show.  Watch the pig roast.  Over and out.  Goodbye.  That's fucking great, man.  That's hilarious, dude.  That's so funny.  I like the whole vibe of it.  It's like, oh, here comes my friend and neighbor.  It's like such an old-school, wholesome show thing to do.  Then you just sit on the porch and say horrible things.  Yeah, it's like a Bing Crosby thing. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just stopping by.  Hey, pig roast.tv, that should have sold some views for you right there.  That's fucking hilarious.  Thanks a lot, dude.  That's fucking hilarious.  Thanks a lot.  That should sell the show right there.  I'm not used to two horrible straight men.  That segment has become really popular.  I was against it because it's not my style of, you know, that Jay Leno, you know, news  of the day thing.  But that's why it works.  It's like, you know, you're not polished at doing it, but it's fun.  It's like two guys just hanging out talking like that.  It's fun doing it, you know?  Yeah, and with George in there, it's fucking great.  Yeah, and you get to see Louis Black tomorrow on location. 
[03:17:00]  We had to come to New York to get him.  Nice.  How about this?  Like, me and you will do it.  Like, we'd look at the paper, and I'd be like, look at this.  Super Bowl.  Nothing super about it.  Go ahead.  Go.  Yeah.  How about those Giants?  You think they go to the World Series?  They have tickets.  Oh, come on.  Wrong sport.  I've got a lot of awkward chuckling.  We have to wrap up.  Hey, sports fans.  Oh, we've got a meeting.  We have a meeting.  No, you're obese sick.  Oh, yeah.

[03:20:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XR.  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, indeed.  All right, it's on.  Don't worry.  Hey, Sam, it's me.  It's Club Soda Kenny.  Hi, Prime Time. 
[03:20:30]  Wow, we got a very busy studio here.  Yeah, but they're talking in the background.  It's just me and you.  Because I got a few minutes to kill while they're in the meeting.  Oh, what are they talking about?  What are you guys talking about?  No, listen.  Sam, I wanted your thoughts on the Chinese New Year.  Okay, I'll tell you about them in a minute.  What are you guys talking about?  Troy's talking with the intern, Sal and Eric.  I have to have him do something for me.  What are you having him do?  He's going to start a rejoiner music project.  Ooh, a project. 
[03:21:00]  Yes.  Like, this is a thing.  I was hoping Otto was going to stay.  Why?  You don't like Troy?  What do you mean?  Like, Otto couldn't stay.  Yeah, but Troy's hanging out and Sal's here.  Mars is back there.  Yeah, no, Mars is cool.  Wow, he's not.  You have a problem with Troy?  Yeah, what's the problem with me?  You already said Mars, right?  I said, Troy's here.  Mars is here.  He goes, yeah, Mars is cool.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Mars is cool.  We talk MMA. 
[03:21:30]  What's this about?  This is getting weird.  Why?  Well, what's the problem?  You don't think Mars is a practitioner?  Well, I understand about Mars.  I know that he used to train MMA.  Used to?  Well, I just thought based on your appearance that you used.  It's going down.  Oh, my mistake.  My mistake.  Mars, what do you think of the Chinese New Year?  Who cares?  I think it's a lovely idea.  It's something different.  What do you mean?  Wait, wait, wait.  You know, it's the year of the dragon, right?  Yeah, I know.  I posted on my Facebook, Club Soda Kenny. 
[03:22:00]  That's what you're going for.  That's what you wanted to get at.  Kenny goes, hey, Sam, can you nominate me for a Shorty Award for best Facebook page?  Yeah.  And I go, Kenny, you don't have a Twitter?  And he goes, yeah.  And I go, it's Twitter awards.  That's why Shorty, 140 characters, by the way.  Shorty's abroad.  Guess who just beat Covino and Rich in the radio category?  Wait, I invited Rich Davis.  I booked him for your after show.  Where is he?  I don't know.  He's interviewing Spartacus somewhere.  Somebody in Albuquerque just feedbacked in. 
[03:22:30]  New Mexico?  That's right.  Kenny is on the air.  I am turning off 105.  Kenny equals comedy cancer.  He's from New Mexico.  What's your deal with Troy?  Yeah, please.  Tell me.  What's your problem here?  Troy, you know.  So anyway, Morris.  There is a problem.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  But it's been weird for quite some time.  Because you used to be best friends.  Yeah.  Yeah, but now, Sam, you know, he's changed.  He has.  Yeah, ever since he's got his booth.  All right, so you moved into the production booth, is what Kenny's referring to, Troy. 
[03:23:00]  Right.  And you've been working on the production and everything.  Yeah.  You can take pictures in here if you want, Josh.  Okay.  You can.  You're welcome to.  You feel comfortable here.  Josh is a stand-up comic?  Yeah, that's what Jim was saying.  I heard him.  How was he?  Jim?  Josh.  Jim's going to be in Tempe, Arizona this weekend for the first time at the Improv.  He just plugged it 10 minutes ago.  Why are you mad at me?  No, I'm not mad.  How has Troy changed since he entered in? 
[03:23:30]  So he got his own production booth, so he doesn't hang out with you.  Sam, we got anything to give away today?  No.  So he doesn't hang out with you at the desk anymore.  Big shout-out to CokeLogic.  This is getting weird.  Yeah, what's he doing?  Why are you avoiding the conflict?  I don't avoid anything.  I'm all about conflict.  You're being very avoidant right now.  Well, then what's the problem?  You're picking up on the avoidance, aren't you?  What's up, Troy?  The question's been asked and answered.  No, you said it hasn't been answered.  Troy, have you changed since you got into that booth?  I mean, my priorities have changed. 
[03:24:00]  I can't sit around and just goof around all day with Kenny.  You know what I mean?  Like, he's in, like...  I rest my case.  He already admitted that he changed.  He's in, like, goofball, hangout, let's be silly mode.  All the time?  Yeah, and I'm working on some shit.  He doesn't have work to do.  Well, I mean, he just says...  Sam, everybody knows I have the hardest job here.  What's that, staying awake?  No, I have to protect lives.  Oh.  But, you know, well, he can do that and still joke around.  Right. 
[03:24:30]  Whereas you...  Well, and if he's not going to be...  If he acts weird to me, I'm just going to shut off to him.  I'm not going to sit there and...  Are you...  Did you stop being cool with him before he stopped being cool with you, or were you just  reacting to his vibe?  I'm just reacting to him.  What's your deal?  Why are you giving Troy the cold shoulder?  So, Mars, you know, MMA, UFC's going to be on Fox this weekend.  Yeah, why is he doing that?  Are you happy about that on Fox?  Yeah, great productions.  Great productions on Fox.  Don't fall for his shit.  Don't fall for his shit, Mars.  You don't...  No, not like you used to have your sidebar. 
[03:25:00]  You understand.  It's not a sidebar.  It is the bar.  It's what's in front of you.  I don't know.  You're just trying to diss me now.  Diss you how?  That was a little rhyme, wasn't it?  I don't know, Dr. Seuss, was it?  Good one.  What's your problem with Troy?  Still avoiding.  What's your problem with Troy?  When you have a problem with other people, you air it out.  What's your problem with Troy?  Yeah, you're so blind.  I don't have a problem.  He just changed.  That's up to him.  How did he change?  He's got a booth. 
[03:25:30]  He's sitting in a different place.  Yeah, he's got a booth now.  And you don't like him because he's sitting in a different place.  And I've invited Kenny to come in and hang out anytime he wants.  No, no, no.  You don't hang out in Troy's booth?  Don't you remember the good old days when I used to have a producer and a technical producer?  I'm still your producer.  And they used to make me sing songs.  Oh, that's what it is.  That's what it is.  Yeah, it is.  I see.  And then, so you're sitting there.  Because he has mentioned this to me before.  So Kenny's sitting there going, I used to be the guy. 
[03:26:00]  I used to sing songs.  I used to have bits.  Take that fucking thing out of the machine.  And then all of a sudden, Kenny turns on the radio.  And Obie's saying we have a new production to play.  Sam and Troy got together and produced it.  Morris, what fight are you excited to see Saturday night?  And this is what he hears.  Shel Sonnen?  Yes.  Yeah.  He's good.  Bobo Man to ONA.  And this rubbed you the wrong way. 
[03:26:30]  And I forgot this fucking song existed.  Can I explain?  So you're saying miss, not hit?  Sam.  Hold on.  I'm a little confused.  He got bothered by this?  He did.  Because I believe, and Troy, you're with me here, that Kenny likes having his bits.  But, you know, we did the songs with Kenny.  You know what it is, Morris?  We'll revisit it again sometime.  Some people don't want their star to shine as bright as theirs.  Okay.  I think some of the pronouns got mixed up in that. 
[03:27:00]  You know what I mean?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Here's how I explain it to Kenny.  Unless it comes up on the air.  We just have him sing every song.  You know what I mean?  Like, what do you do?  Oh, here's the top ten songs in the country right now.  Can he sing them all?  It's got to come up on the air.  Like, Opie will be like, oh, Kenny should sing this.  And then Sam and I will get to work.  Take the initiative.  So, Kenny, what?  Well, how many songs do you want to sing?  How many songs?  I'd love to know in the database how many songs Kenny has sang on.  It's like, how many? 
[03:27:30]  Like, is the bits still funny?  Eric, yeah.  Let's not forget about Eric.  Let's bring Eric into the mix.  How are you doing today, Eric?  You're not the host.  I'm doing good, Kenny.  How are you?  How many songs?  Eric.  Good luck with everything this weekend, Eric.  What's going on this weekend?  I'm moving.  Don't start bragging about your house again.  Troy will get all upset.  No, maybe you want to help him move or something.  No, I don't want to help him move.  Oh, all of a sudden, he's not a friend no more, Eric.  He's not all of a sudden.  You see that?  If I wasn't in Tempe, Arizona with Jim Norton, I would be there helping you move. 
[03:28:00]  Where in Tempe, Arizona are you going to be?  At the improv.  Do me a favor and see how many songs.  And next week, I'll be in Poughkeepsie.  I could turn off your mic any time.  I don't care.  I'll yell.  Why is he all fired up?  I don't know.  What is going on?  Why are you all fired up?  This is a show.  Eric, count how many times Kenny's done songs for me.  Because you've got them all in the library, right?  I'm looking through here.  Okay, just count them up.  But Sam, back me up on this.  I mean, how many times is Kenny singing still funny?  Troy's calling for backup, Mars.  Shouldn't you reinvent it or think of something new? 
[03:28:30]  Or if it comes up on the air, then you do it.  If Opie is like, oh, you know, Kenny, you should sing this song.  Josh, come here.  Take Anthony's mic.  Mention Opie a few more times, Troy.  Nailed you with that.  You have been mentioning Opie's name a lot.  This is exciting.  That's Anthony's real microphone.  Josh, you're obviously an avid listener because your family bid on a cherry auction.  I'm going now.  That won you this prize, right?  Thanks for having me on the after show. 
[03:29:00]  Do you think that the show needs more songs from Kenny?  I'm glad that guy from New Mexico turned off his radio.  Or less songs from Kenny.  Coke Logic didn't.  We could go with a few more.  You don't have to turn off my microphone.  You think of me?  Yeah, a few more.  Like, is it something you want to hear every week?  No, not every week.  Thanks for stopping by, Josh.  Your mic was on that time.  Wow.  Are you leaving?  He's so fired up.  I don't understand.  We'll get to you. 
[03:29:30]  We'll do more production with you.  Not listen.  Okay.  What's between me and Troy is between me and Troy.  And, by the way, there is a Kenny production piece in the works that Danny wrote that we're going to get started on.  Did you know about that, Kenny?  Yeah, he knows about it.  So what are you complaining about?  There's a piece in the works.  What are you all fired up about?  God damn it, Kenny.  What are you all fired up about?  He's fired up.  Not just me.  How many songs?  Right, Eric?  Eric, who you with? 
[03:30:00]  I'm with you, Kenny, on this.  I don't have headphones on.  I'm leaving.  They're not including Kenny's other production pieces, just the songs.  Just the songs.  I have 31 songs.  31 songs, Kenny.  31 songs.  How much more do you fucking want?  That's a double album.  Okay.  31 songs.  You don't think that's enough?  It's up to you.  No, yeah, exactly.  It's up to us.  We say either reinvent it or wait until it comes up on the air.  Later.  Quit being so salty.  Where's he going now? 
[03:30:30]  Is the meeting over?  I wonder what they're talking about in that meeting.  He just, he won't talk to me.  He puts his head down when I walk by him.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a legit thing.  Well, I mean, as legit as Kenny can be.  I mean, you remember, he didn't talk to me for four months because I thought that his  hands were a little chafed and I tried to put hand lotion on him.  He figured that was assault.  And he won't even talk about it.  I just want to figure out why he's upset.  Because he doesn't have a valid argument.  So he just starts yelling?  Yeah.  Plugs?  Yeah.  You know that he doesn't have a valid argument.  Sam, are we going to just have Kenny sing again? 
[03:31:00]  I mean, I'm not saying that we'll never have Kenny sing another song again.  But don't you think it's like...  We've done it.  Yeah.  Josh, what do you think is a fan?  Like I said, a few more is okay.  You know?  You don't have to hear it every time.  But is that something you were sitting there going, oh man, I wish Kenny was singing a  song.  Yeah, I'm not rubbing my hands together craving it.  Yeah.  I mean, people like it, but we can't shove it down people's throat just to get more Kenny  Mars.  Well, I see Kenny's point.  You know, he's been singing all these songs all this time, so he should still continue 
[03:31:30]  doing it.  That's how he feels.  Well, it's not just one person sings songs.  31 songs.  Think about it.  That's a lot of fucking songs.  That's a lot of fucking songs.  We've also had Intern David sing songs.  We've had Roland sing songs.  We've had anybody who has a goofy voice sing songs.  Like, it's not like that's his thing.  He's just singing.  And it's not like it's...  This was a parody song, the Bobo thing.  Have you guys noticed how temperamental Kenny is? 
[03:32:00]  Is he salty, you think?  Yeah, he gets insulted pretty quick.  And then he won't talk to you for months.  Yes.  And you won't even notice it because you're like, he'll walk away or he'll smile.  You just figure he's busy.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, he's not talking to you for a couple of months, like you said.  Yeah.  You're like, what did I do?  Four months because I tried to put hand lotion on him.  This is a good feedback.  Ryan said that it's sad that Kenny is jealous of Bobo's airtime.  Exactly.  Thank you.  That's the attention that Kenny's going for.  And it's not like Kenny comes with all these ideas like, hey, let's try this or hey, let's try that. 
[03:32:30]  He just wants to sing another song.  It's just like it's the same idea.  Don't you think it should be reinvented?  I mean, we did Kenny auto-tuned.  That was fun.  But we did it.  We did it.  Have you done duets?  Maybe he wants to do duets.  Who would you like to hear Kenny do a duet with?  Kenny and Bobo.  Let's get him both.  I have three Kenny duets.  You have three Kenny duets already.  I have Kenny and Roland.  I have Kenny and Steve Freed, Wood Yee.  And Kenny and Sam. 
[03:33:00]  Who rubs Kenny wrong the most?  That's a great question.  I would say at this point, I think he goes in cycles.  Don't you think that, Mars?  Absolutely.  And so he'll pick targets.  It seems like right now, Troy is the one on the top of his shit list.  Or am I wrong, Mars?  Because I'm in here a lot of times.  It's not Kenny picking.  It's people offending Kenny.  Yeah.  So that might be the best duet at the moment.  Whoever's offending Kenny right now.  So you want to see Troy on the track with Kenny because at the moment, he's the one who's 
[03:33:30]  offending them.  Like they have to work together in studio.  What do you think of that, Troy?  Sure.  I'll do a duet with Kenny.  I have nothing.  I have no problem with Kenny.  Kenny's the one that always has a problem.  What type of?  And Kenny always has to have a problem with somebody.  It's just not like he's ever cool with everybody across the board.  What are you laughing at, Mars?  It just sounds like someone else does that.  Who?  No.  I don't know.  I'll keep that to myself.  Who do you think it sounds like that always has to have a problem? 
[03:34:00]  Why are you going to say that and then I'll bring it up?  Is it somebody you've had a problem with in the past?  Who, myself?  Yeah.  I've had a problem with myself.  It could be me.  I have had my fair share of problems with people.  Why is Mars taking shots?  He's taking shots at something.  Last time, I'm assuming he's taking shots at Danny again.  No, no.  I was talking about myself.  That's bullshit.  All right.  He said, yeah.  I'm talking about myself, but I don't want to mention it because then I'll start arguing  with myself.  I thought you guys were cool.  Who?  You and Danny.  We are.  Okay.  So why are you taking a shot at him?  I didn't.  I said I was talking about myself. 
[03:34:30]  He wasn't talking about himself.  He's just bullshitting.  Why can't anybody just speak clear and be like, yeah, this is the problem.  This is what's going on.  You know why?  It's always vagary.  Because they're afraid.  They're afraid of the confrontation.  Right.  Because that gets ugly.  Yeah.  People are scared.  It's fine.  It's cool.  You're talking about yourself.  But then why would you say that in the first place, though?  That's the question.  Why would you hint to it?  Because they want it out there, but then when it's like, all right, I'm going to call  you on that, they're like, oh, no, I meant I was talking about myself.  Instead of just stepping up and being like, all right, here's the problem. 
[03:35:00]  Let's hash this out.  All right, Troy.  How about the last time you came in here and started talking shit to Sam and then backed  up?  And I said everything to his face that I ever had to say to him.  Not totally on air when he was asking you.  You backed up.  What wasn't said?  I don't know.  There was vagary there, too, is what I'm saying.  Well, there was some stuff that shouldn't go on air that was said to him.  Okay.  Yeah, but it's personal stuff that you just don't.  There's a difference between not bringing up stuff that you really can't say on the air 
[03:35:30]  and just saying you have a problem with somebody, but you won't say who it is.  What?  What the fuck do you say?  That makes sense.  No, no.  That made perfect sense to me.  In the context of you saying there are other people here who like to have problems with people.  And I had a problem with Sam, and I called him out on bullshit.  So that personal stuff that you didn't bring up, it was vague, and I didn't know it was personal,  but it sounded vague.  But it wasn't for on air.  I was asking him if you want, I was saying, do you want to go here with this?  Do you want to go here with this?  And you know that.  Okay.  But the problem that I had with Sam on air, everything got brought up. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  And I had no problem saying what I had to say to his face.  Okay.  It wasn't just vagary, like, you know, take a stab at him and be like, oh, nothing, nothing.  Never mind.  I was talking about myself.  He'd be like, what?  Right?  Uh, right.  He's going to MMA websites to pretend that he's not likely, he doesn't have to actually  address what you're saying.  Yeah.  So he can avoid eye contact.  What are you doing in here, Mars? 
[03:36:30]  You fucking called me over.  No, I don't mean, like, why are you in here?  I'm.  Oh, that's the lady from Book Radio.  Let her in.  Let her in.  Let her in.  You can come in.  Let her in.  You can come in.  Come on in.  You can come in if you want.  I mean, the lady.  You can come in if you want.  Whoa.  This is big.  This is exclusive.  Yeah.  She's old.  Open the door for her.  I hear you're saying bad things about me.  No.  Everybody listens to Book Radio. 
[03:37:00]  I know.  What do you mean?  Welcome to the show.  This is.  You don't even know who I am.  Well, the audience does.  Pia.  But it's more importantly.  You can pronounce it.  The lady from the Book Radio poster.  The Book Radio.  I mean, I got my picture up there.  Are you trying to get it down?  Come on.  I think that's what happened.  You understand.  O&A are sitting here one day and they're going, we're not in the lobby.  Who else is over there?  And for a second, we were like, who is this lady? 
[03:37:30]  So I ran down.  Yes.  And I saw who was representing Book Radio.  That's it.  And ever since then, there's been a point of contention over Book Radio receiving lobby  priority over the Opie and Anthony show.  Book Radio.  You can see.  I'm there to defend my picture on Book Radio.  So I thought I'd just come over and say hello.  You think that.  So you know who your competition is.  You think that right now the Book Radio poster stays and Opie and Anthony can wait.  Well, they take mine down.  Wait a minute.  It's not up all the time.  It comes and goes. 
[03:38:00]  They tell us that too.  They told us those posters were rotating.  And they're not.  But that was like a week ago.  And the Book Radio thing is still there.  Wow.  I'm so happy.  You know what I had to do to get that?  What did you have to do?  Did you?  Friends in high places.  You know that.  Because like we complain on the air.  You know that.  Yeah.  We complain on the air.  Yes.  And then hopefully something gets done.  But on Book Radio you don't have.  You can't because it's not in a book.  I can.  I'm allowed to talk to people who haven't written a book.  If you've written something on a paper napkin or you've written a poem. 
[03:38:30]  Anything.  Anything.  I've expanded.  So theoretically.  It doesn't have to be a book.  It can be something you wrote on match cover.  So if I write like a blog.  Yeah.  I got it.  We can talk.  Can I get on your Book Radio show?  Yes.  Because I try to get on as many channels as possible.  I've never been on Book Radio.  You're on.  Oh this is bad.  Why don't you have to be informed?  I like that.  Keep the Book Radio poster I say.  Thank you.  Thank you Pia for stopping by.  Have fun at the Super Bowl.  That was funny Mars.  There you go. 
[03:39:00]  There was.  There was.  Pia Lindstrom is her name.  Yeah.  And E-Rock didn't just tell me that in my headphones.  I knew her name.  But I wanted to make sure that everybody was on board.  This is the Book Radio lady.  Book Radio!  That's right.  That's right Anthony.  I wonder if you think Anthony and Opie and Anthony will be pissed that I.  I mean if she can get me on Book Radio I wouldn't say take the sign down just yet.  Right.  Well I mean clearly if you can get on a bigger show.  Right.  I mean they blame you.  And if Book Radio is what's receiving the priority here.  Right. 
[03:39:30]  Maybe that's where I should be producing.  Maybe Book Radio needs an after show.  Maybe they need an epilogue show.  That's not a bad idea.  You know.  That's something I could do.  That could be a hot show.  I don't know.  Maybe they need the youth over there.  That's why they need to bring you over.  Maybe they need a young adult section.  That's right.  And that's something that I can handle.  I'll read Goosebumps books.  Yeah.  And all kinds of stuff.  Diary of a Wimpy Kid.  Right.  You've got it covered.  Sweet Valley High.  I'll hit the ladies too.  Everybody Poops.  I'm not going to read that book.  That's just vulgar.  I don't think it's an XL channel.  I don't know.  I don't know how much I can get away with.  But I do know. 
[03:40:00]  You know.  You're talking about hotness.  You're talking about what the hot channel is.  I'll tell you what the hot diamond store is right now.  Do you know what it is, Troy?  Steven Singer?  That's right.  Steven Singer Jewelers.  And you know.  You could talk about everything he does.  You could talk about all the holiday presents.  You could talk about the Super Silver Collection.  You could talk about the Get Naked Collection.  You could even talk about Black Diamonds.  If you want.  But you're not going to hit the fact that Steven Singer is the most dominant. 
[03:40:30]  Diamond store in the country.  In the world.  I think in the world.  He says in America.  But it's the best diamond store I've ever been to.  The absolute best place to go for your engagement ring.  I made the journey down to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to see Steven Singer myself.  I got my engagement ring.  He and Turbo Joe made me an expert.  He can make you an expert too.  He has the largest selection of loose certified diamonds.  And an inventory of over 3,000 settings for you to choose from.  The guarantee and warranty that he gives you is completely unrivaled by his competition. 
[03:41:00]  There's nobody that can match it.  And if Troy started a diamond shop.  You might as well go out of business now.  Because you couldn't match this.  I mean.  Have you.  You haven't been to his place.  I have not.  No.  You got to check this place out.  You have.  If you have any ladies in your life.  And I'm sure you have a few.  You know.  You're going to want to buy these in bulk.  And I'm sure Steven Singer can make you a deal.  100% full money back guarantee.  Which you'll probably end up returning a diamond or two.  Because these relationships you have.  They're not long ones.  A little flaky.  Yeah.  A little flaky. 
[03:41:30]  That's right.  It's truly risk free shopping.  So when it's time for the ring.  Don't forget this piece of advice.  Go see my pal.  Steven Singer.  He's in Philadelphia.  At the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  He's online at IHateStevenSinger.com.  And he's even got a telephone.  Which you can reach.  At 1-888-IHATEStevenSinger.  He's a Philly legend for a reason.  You know.  You drive into Philadelphia.  And there's a giant Steven Singer billboard.  So check him out today.  At IHateStevenSinger.  And Josh.  That goes double for you. 
[03:42:00]  Since you're in here.  Yeah.  I mean.  I don't know.  I would give you Steven Singer merchandise.  But we don't have any.  That would probably cover my trip then.  Yeah.  You could hawk it or something.  And just see what you could do with it.  I'll tell you this Troy.  Yeah.  We played the Bobo song yesterday.  Oh.  I wanted to talk real quick.  Before I hit the Bobo song.  E-Rock.  The Cinnamon Challenge.  Yeah.  We played the clip today.  I want to know the truth.  We're four years removed from it.  Is that the closest you've ever been to death? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Second closest to death.  What's the first closest?  I was a kid.  Certain areas of Long Island had those beaches that you could drive on.  Sure.  And I was playing wiffle ball with my cousins and stuff.  And I ran out to get a ball.  And this drunk guy was driving a blazer.  Kind of swerved off the sand road and up on the dunes where we were.  And just barely hit me.  He did hit you. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Like I spun.  But it was like it was hardly anything.  Did his car bounce off you?  Very funny.  You see where I was going with that, right?  Very funny.  I didn't mean it.  But did you, when you were choking on the cinnamon, was there like a moment where you were like, this could realistically be.  You see it in the video.  Where you go, this could be my death?  Yeah, a little further because my mouth just opened real wide.  But I couldn't get like my tongue to move and my throat to open where I'm just going like that because it was starting to cake in my throat. 
[03:43:30]  And normally cake in your throat is something you love so much.  Yeah, good food reference.  So it was cake in my throat and like that passageway that goes up into your nose, I just couldn't breathe at all.  So would that be considered an acceptable enhanced interrogation tactic?  Yeah.  Cinnamon challenges.  We'll stop waterboarding.  We'll do cinnamon challenges.  Yeah, we'll put more cinnamon in next time.  What did you think?  Like this is what my legacy is going to be?  Or did you think finally I'll fuck those O&A guys once and for all. 
[03:44:00]  There's no way they'll get away with this.  Yeah, because just when I die, they get fired and they come back a few years later with an even better deal.  And it was all for naught.  Based off of that.  And Bob Kelly would get life in prison for putting the cinnamon in your mouth.  Well, I mean, I'm glad that you survived it.  Yeah, even though we said that the mayo challenge is when my eyes turned really, and that was the worst, when they turned really red.  My eyes were still pretty damn red after the cinnamon challenge too.  Like that and around my eyes, I broke a lot of the capillaries there. 
[03:44:30]  But at least, and were you burping cinnamon forever after that?  Well, once I started drinking the water and that made it even worse, they got me club soda and diet soda because the carbonation actually broke it up.  So I was able to breathe better.  The water just destroyed you?  The water turned it into solid cement.  So I had to get something with carbonation in there to break it up.  But did you panic?  Oh, fuck yeah, I was panicking.  You thought you were going to die.  You have the raw footage.  Yeah.  I mean, that's just a small part of what was actually going on. 
[03:45:00]  But I mean, you were still taping after I was, you know, spitting and wiping my face with the paper towel.  I got to find that tape.  Find the extra footage.  But it was going on for a while where I was still, like, almost hyperventilating, trying to breathe.  Like, holy shit, I just almost died in this stupid radio studio for this goddamn show.  That's exactly what was going through my head.  This is how I'm going out?  Yeah, like, of all the shitty things you assholes have made me do, now you're going to kill me via cinnamon injection. 
[03:45:30]  And it doesn't even have that many views.  How much does it have?  I don't know.  It's like 170,000.  Well, I'm sorry.  174,000.  174,000.  For some of us, that's pretty healthy.  Yeah, but that was five years ago.  I like the, uh, what's at the bottom?  At least be in a million.  What'd you say, Troy?  I like what's at the bottom of the video.  Oh, the foundry plug?  Oh, yeah.  Real nice, right?  Great.  You had so much to do with that, didn't you?  Somebody's saying the cinnamon challenge was all my idea. 
[03:46:00]  I don't know.  If it was, I'll take credit for it.  I mean, I don't think that's anything to be ashamed of.  It was a great bit, right?  Yeah.  Would you do it again?  Hell no.  You wouldn't.  Why not?  I don't need to.  You don't need to or fear of death?  I don't need to.  Okay, so the fact that you-  I've done it already.  But the fact that you almost died doesn't add up at all.  At this point, no.  You don't care anymore?  No, I don't care.  Someone else is more than welcome to try it.  Hmm.  There's no drive to redeem yourself?  Yeah, is there?  Do you want to go on there and say, I could do this shit?  Yeah, let me try to make up for almost dying. 
[03:46:30]  I can survive this.  Our buddy Bobby the Champs on the phone, former intern for both Opie and Anthony and Ron and Fez.  What's up, Bobby?  Hey, Sam.  Does he still want to be Roland's life coach?  Yeah, I mean, I'm assuming both of us gave up on the life coaching thing, Bobby.  Yeah, I kind of give up.  Although, I do see him on, like, 50th Street walking sometimes.  I'm like, I always want to say something.  I'm like, hey, you know what?  Forget it.  It's nice that he's at least walking.  Yeah.  No, I guess it is good.  But he's always, like, walking towards Caroline.  Like, that's why I always say him.  He's going for drinks. 
[03:47:00]  I guess.  No, he stopped drinking.  Oh, did he?  That's what he told me.  I bet.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  He stopped drinking the moment he saw you.  He stopped drinking when you walked in the office.  And then he was going to start once you left.  So, what's up, Bobby?  I completed the cinnamon challenge the one time I tried it.  And I attack eating challenges the same way every single time.  You basically have to plan to swallow once whole the entire thing.  So, you put the whole thing in your mouth and kind of have a little saliva.  And then just one big swallow. 
[03:47:30]  I mean, it's still terrible in the stomach.  But it basically goes down a lot easier.  And you don't cough.  And it's not in your sinuses.  So, you swallowed the entire spoonful of cinnamon in one gulp?  Basically whole, yes.  Because you can't break it up.  Same thing with a cracker challenge.  You have to chew a bunch of them up, make one ball, and then swallow it like a lump.  I mean, it hurts.  But that's how it's completed.  Eric, do you think you could have swallowed that?  Well, no.  Here's the difference.  If you watch a lot of those videos online, it's an old... 
[03:48:00]  The cinnamon challenge thing goes back so many years.  It's an old thing they used to do at restaurants.  But if you watch any of those videos...  They used to do that at restaurants?  Yeah, it's an old restaurant gag.  It's dangerous.  If you look at the portions that people have on their spoons, it was nowhere near the tablespoon  and the almost three-quarters of an inch high pile that they had on that spoon that Bobby shoved into my mouth.  I would describe Eric's spoonful as heaping.  Yes.  You can't swallow a quarter cup of cinnamon.  No, it just can't happen.  Yeah, that definitely will make it. 
[03:48:30]  It will never happen again either.  There's no way they'd let that happen.  No, I mean, how could it be irresponsible?  Eric almost died.  Right.  Did you hear, Bobby, did you hear the Bobo song yesterday?  I did.  What did you think?  Was it a hit or a miss?  I think it was a smash.  Wow.  A lot of people love the song, Troy.  I got some tweets about it as well.  Fundamentally, it was terrible.  If you take a step back and then realize what it actually is, it's hard not to laugh, and that's the goal of it, right? 
[03:49:00]  To laugh.  Hey, it's a comedy show.  Mm-hmm.  Well, thank you very much, Bobby.  All right.  Have a good day, guys.  Enjoy your day.  And somebody's feedback in asking about the Chubby Bunny bit.  Eric, you didn't come close to dying on Chubby Bunny, did you?  No, I didn't.  You enjoyed it, too, didn't you?  No, I hate marshmallows.  You hate marshmallows?  Yeah, I don't like marshmallows.  I said that when we started.  I don't like marshmallows.  It's weird.  Marshmallows are good.  We had somebody else do the Chubby Bunny thing, too.  I'm trying to remember who else was there that did it.  Pat Duffy. 
[03:49:30]  I think Roland tried it.  I think I did it at one point, but I like marshmallows.  I'll have to look back and see.  Well, yeah, Troy, the thing about the Bobo song, every time this show after Opie and Anthony Live replayed yesterday,  I got another tweet from somebody saying they loved the song.  Yeah, I got a couple tweets, too, at Troy Kwan on Twitter.  That wasn't slaky.  People know exactly what you did.  You son of a bitch.  No, but I did get a lot of tweets.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Good tweets? 
[03:50:00]  People said they loved it, so, I mean, how could they?  Are you taking back your stance on this?  It was painful to do.  Bobo sucks.  But if people enjoy it, then people enjoy it.  Josh, you won the auction to be here.  Yes.  Did you hear?  When did you fly?  Yesterday.  So I didn't get to hear the Bobo song.  Did you hear that, Troy?  Wow.  I was not privileged enough to hear that.  Just give him the disc and let him take it home with him.  Did you want to hear it?  I do want to hear it.  I want to know what everybody's talking about. 
[03:50:30]  And while Troy's here, I mean, he's the producer of the song.  You should hang out for this, Troy.  You should stick around.  I got a lot of work to do.  Yeah, I understand that, but, you know, we're doing the show right now, and what's on air  comes before everything, doesn't it?  Does it?  Doesn't it?  I thought so.  Depends on who you ask, I guess.  Well, Josh, what happened was Jimmy Fallon did the T-Bowie song, so we decided to do Bobo-y.  We got in the studio, and Bobo wasn't the singer that I thought he was. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  He wasn't quite as able to follow me as well as I thought he would be.  Oh, boy.  I would play the song, but Kenny's coming back up the hall, and Kenny's specialty is making  sure that whatever is happening isn't happening anymore.  So before we start this, let's see if he's coming in here.  Troy, you're fed up with this shit.  Well, it's just like...  Okay, Kenny's back.  Sam, it's a long meeting.  What are they doing?  I don't know, but it's long.  They said they were going to make it short, but it's long.  What do the faces look like in there? 
[03:51:30]  But, you know, I just came back to give a shout-out to DJ Troy Kwan.  I didn't ask a question.  Who he DJs at the...  How do you pronounce it?  That German name?  Just go through the conversation.  Yeah.  He plugs out, you know?  Yeah.  No, like, you're starting to start turmoil.  I didn't...  Mark, did I start this turmoil?  I simply observed the fact that Kenny wasn't talking to Troy.  Yeah, because I'm a leader.  I'm not a follower.  So I'm not answering your questions. 
[03:52:00]  That's not...  That doesn't even make any sense.  Troy DJs.  I know that.  Yeah.  He puts out mixtapes.  You know what else he does?  He produces.  What's he produce?  Well, I'm glad you asked, Josh.  Hey, um...  And then I told Steve Starniolo to come in here, but he didn't want to come in here.  Why would you tell him to do that?  I don't care where...  Why do you got a problem with him?  I have nothing to say to him.  There was nothing on the show today that related to him. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, but, like, he's a great personality, right, Eric?  I just talked to him yesterday.  He just walked right by the studio and kept walking.  I talked to him yesterday.  Troy, he posts his mixtapes on SoundCloud.  Yeah, I know that.  No, they're good.  Well, then go to his SoundCloud.  No, I...  Why are you being cool now?  Why weren't you being cool five minutes ago?  Because he's obnoxious.  What's going on, Kenny, man?  I'm fucking confused, man. 
[03:53:00]  Kenny just tries to spin in circles.  Yeah.  It's all right.  You know what it is?  He'll grow out of it once.  He just leads this life of nothingness.  And so he just fills it with stuff.  And sometimes there's turmoil, and sometimes there's not.  And there's no rhyme or reason for any of it.  Yeah.  It just fills a void before he can drive home.  There's turmoil frequently for you.  No, you tried to start something.  Troy, did I start...  No, I think he just was asking questions about what's going on.  But you just never shoot anybody straight with the answer. 
[03:53:30]  You never go, look, I'm pissed off because of this.  I'm not pissed off.  Well, you obviously are.  You haven't really talked to me in a couple months.  Because you've got a booth.  Go in the booth and talk to him.  Yeah.  I invited you in any time to come in and hang out.  I can't.  I have to stay on my post.  Okay.  Well, then don't be mad at me about that.  What's my post called, Sam?  It depends on where you're located.  The danger zone.  The danger zone is your main post.  Yeah.  Sometimes you'll make sure everything's going okay in the control room. 
[03:54:00]  No, the command center.  The command center.  But you don't go downtown very often anymore.  Oh, no.  That's where the meeting is.  The meeting is downtown.  Yeah.  No, the meeting is...  What was it past downtown?  No, there's cross town to the bathrooms.  Right.  But what...  No.  Downtown was like where the O&A office is.  Yeah.  Then what's further downtown?  Oh, that's uptown then.  Right.  So they went uptown.  Yeah.  They went to like Park Avenue.  Don't they call it Elon City?  I was listening this whole time. 
[03:54:30]  They call it Elon City, Eric.  But Kenny at one point decided to rename every area of the office after he saw the film Green  Zone.  Oh, okay.  I was talking to Steve Starniolo.  I was hoping Rich Davis was coming in, so...  What's the name of the hallway that leads to the danger zone?  That's the highway to the danger zone.  And where is the green zone again?  That's your office.  Oh, right.  That's green zone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What does green zone refer to?  I've never seen the film.  Safe.  Safe.  Okay.  So that's when it's cool.  Everything's cool. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah.  Everyone's copacetic.  Yeah.  Well, why don't you turn the green zone into Troy's booth?  So that way everybody could be cool again.  It's a booth.  Where's the red zone?  Well, the danger zone.  In my pants!  It's for loading and unloading of passengers only.  I guess so.  All right, Kenny.  Can I play the Bobo song now?  I don't care.  All right.  I think the meeting's anything.  Is it for real?  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  I just came down here because I wanted to set the record straight that Sam the Shit 
[03:55:30]  Stirrer...  I mean, I didn't...  Yeah, there was no shit starting.  He was just asking questions.  But I can love stir a little bit because people are asking if maybe there's a  there could be some hugging.  Like a Kenny...  Wait a minute.  ...Troy hug.  Oh, I just got a text.  They're out of the meeting.  Thank God.  The same person that texted you texted me.  Psych!  Who texted...  Nobody texted me.  No, the person that was texting you before.  Oh. 
[03:56:00]  I...  You see what I have to deal with here, Josh?  I don't know how you do it.  You see what I have to deal with?  I don't know how you do it.  People don't give me enough respect.  This is what I have to deal with on a daily basis.  Even off the air.  He's the same dope.  Yeah, this isn't an act for on the air.  He just, like...  He just says things that are completely off the rails of what anyone's talking about.  And he insists on furthering the conversation.  Then when you get to a place where you're actually talking about what he wanted to, he decides to change.  And we're going to talk about something completely different. 
[03:56:30]  It's the most frustrating thing in the world.  But he can do that.  He can do that.  Because he's intimidating.  He's a large, intimidating fella.  Speaking of intimidating, the Bobo song.  Intimidating production.  Intimidatingly good.  The writing, the production, and most importantly, the singing.  People said it was a hit yesterday.  Anyway, the consensus I got was it was a hit, not a miss.  You voted miss, Troy.  Yeah.  It's unlistenable.  Eric voted hit. 
[03:57:00]  Travis voted hit.  Mars, did you hear it yesterday?  Yes.  And you vote hit.  Yes.  Absolutely.  It does what it's set out to do.  Makes you laugh a little bit?  Piss people off.  Piss people off.  Makes you nauseous.  I'll explain why I thought it was a hit if you want.  Why did you think it was a hit?  Because I think this counts as an appearance.  So that means we have to rest him for a while and he's not allowed back on the show.  Well, that seems unfair.  That's unfair voting practices.  Here it is.  Bo Bowie. 
[03:57:30]  Troy, you just stick around for a while.  I was going to get you.  No, stick around for a little bit.  Bo-bo-man to O-N-A.  Hang out, Troy.  Put the headphones back on.  Bo-bo-man to O-N-A.  Let me on the show.  Just let me right back on.  Ten.  Bo-bo-man to O-N-A. 
[03:58:00]  Seven.  Six.  Five.  Two.  Four.  One.  Three.  I got the countdown wrong.  Did you guys notice that again?  He's stupid, you see.  Troy, put the headphones back on.  Enjoy this with the rest of us.  We're partying.  We're celebrating a little bit.  All right.  Here he goes.  This is Bo-bo-man to O-N-A. 
[03:58:30]  I swear that I'm not dead.  Won't you let me just do something on the air?  My dog's named Mr. Maloonigans, I swear.  This is O-N-A to Bo-bo-man.  We think you're really great. 
[03:59:00]  Even though your dick is small and you seem gay.  You fucked your brother once, but that's okay.  But they...  Josh, what do you think so far?  I love it.  So far, so good.  I love it, yeah.  That's another person who loves it, Troy.  Think about the audience.  As long as they're satisfied.  Sorry about that.  I'm going to put it back on. 
[03:59:30]  Bo-bo-man's not dead.  No matter what the haters said.  Hey, timing is not his strong suit.  No.  But you see where it is.  But it's passion that comes through.  You get that?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Because, you know...  I mean, this is his plea to let him back on the show and to kind of describe who he is.  Yeah.  And I like that it's one of those you have to listen to a few times to really get it. 
[04:00:00]  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  Bo-bo-man's not his name.  I don't know.  But I'm so tired.  I don't know.  My IQ's in a double digits.  I'm smart enough to know.  It's okay to do things when it's for the show  Mr. Maloonigans, I love you very much  I blow him 
[04:00:30]  Bobo Man, ONA  Your show needs help, there's something wrong  Why am I banned, why are you mean?  Can you hear me, ONA?  Can you hear me, ONA?  Can you hear me, ONA?  What, can he hear me or not, right?  I mean, I've listened to it a few times now  I'm still saying hit 
[04:01:00]  What about you, Josh?  That's a huge hit  You like it  Huge hit  You like it a lot  You can hear the tears rolling down his cheeks as he's singing that  Troy  Yeah  People love the song  Well, that's great  You're wrong about this  That's fine  I've been wrong before  Weren't you in bands, though?  I thought you knew something about music  I thought so, too  Are you questioning everything?  Well, yeah  I'm gonna have to double-check all your shit from now on  Because you, before, you've said stuff  I don't want to hand this in, it's not good  And I go, okay  I'm not gonna take your word for it anymore  I can't  I guess it's just because I had to actually deal with him in the studio 
[04:01:30]  And he's such a fucking asshole  He really is difficult to work with  He's just, he really thinks he's, he rolls in there as a rock star  Yeah  Doesn't he?  Well, he got his hot chocolate and his dollar  For coming in  I didn't give him the ten  Oh, you didn't give him the ten  Just give him the dollar bill  Well, Josh, I hope you had a good time  I did  I hope you got your money's worth  That's my family's money, so  Well, and yours with the plane ticket  Yeah, that's true  Do you have anything you want to plug?  Sure, if I can  You can plug anything you want
