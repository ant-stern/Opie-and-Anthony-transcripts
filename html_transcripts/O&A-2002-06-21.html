<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heavy focus on their "WOW Contest," showcasing pictures of female listeners. The hosts, using crude and sexually explicit language, extensively reviewed entries from various cities, lavishing praise on the Dallas contestants (Parker, Shea, Stephanie, among others) while criticizing those from Philadelphia (too many, low quality), Sacramento (past its prime), and New York (underperforming).  A Dallas caller provided additional details about some contestants. Katana's entry was temporarily removed due to a missing ID.  The segment continued with the hosts repeatedly playing and mocking a low-quality song, "Total Recallin'," and discussing photoshopped images on foundrymusic.com featuring their heads on the bodies of WOW contestants. A call with Pugs and Kelly further detailed the Dallas contestants, leading to more sexually suggestive commentary and discussion of cosmetic surgery and tattoos.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Rudy Giuliani's divorce from Donna Hanover, filled with highly critical and offensive comments directed at Hanover. The hosts discussed Giuliani's actions and public image surrounding 9/11, incorporating more crude language and political commentary. A caller recounted a negative experience with Giuliani's administration, complaining about broken promises regarding police raises.  This sparked a debate about Giuliani's role after 9/11.  The segment concluded abruptly with a listener dedication to a deceased pet dog, interrupting a record and causing Opie to express frustration with the transition.  Earl, filling in for Scott Farrell, called in from Belmont Racetrack, and a bet was placed on a horse race.

The next segment dealt with divorce settlements, focusing on perceived unfairness towards men.  Several callers shared their experiences, detailing high alimony payments and the common practice of husbands leaving the marital home. Cheryl described contrasting divorce practices in the Caribbean.  The conversation touched on child support and prenuptial agreements.  A recurring bit involved callers describing items found in their parents' or siblings' bedrooms; these included expired condoms, Playboy magazines, dildos, and other suggestive materials. A prerecorded prank call by "Wheelchair Fred" to directory assistance seeking a "Bushlicker" was played.  The segment promoted the "WOW contest," "Lady Di" (a segment regular), the "Tippy Tom" alcohol service, and a contest on opianthony.com.

Another segment continued the recurring bit of callers describing items found in siblings' bedrooms. Chris (22) found sex toys and condoms in his 26-year-old sister's room, highlighting her interracial relationship and his Italian family's potential disapproval. Rick found Vaseline, toilet paper, and a mini baseball bat under his sister's bed. Don claimed to be in Roseanne O'Donnell's house and described finding a book titled "How to Adopt and Abuse Black Kids." A hostile call from Heather resulted in a vulgar exchange.  The focus then shifted to "Lady Di," whose fate on the show depended on listener votes on opianthony.com.  Michelle (23) described adult films and sex toys in her 14-year-old stepbrother's room, and Wendy described a multi-functional sex toy found in her brother's room. Virgil discussed the explicit content of "Put Out or Get Out."  A live, on-air sixth-grade history exam for Lady Di was interrupted by further calls, including a heated argument with Marion, a friend who criticized Lady Di's behavior and drinking habits.  Lady Di answered many questions incorrectly, leading to laughter and insults from the hosts. The exam was incomplete at the broadcast's end.

The final segment focused on "Lady Di" participating in a trivia game, where the hosts and announcer relentlessly mocked her incorrect answers.  Her answers, ranging from identifying the first man on the moon (incorrectly guessing "John Smith" and "Sam Smith") to basic geography and science questions, were met with insults like "dumbass," "twat," and "stupid."  The quiz covered various topics, from the cardinal directions to the name of John Lithgow's alien TV show, with Lady Di scoring approximately 35%.  The segment concluded with a call to action for listeners to vote on whether she should remain on the show.  Throughout the entire broadcast, crude humor, sexual innuendo, and offensive language were pervasive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Couple phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027, outside of New York City, 866-277-4-WOW, 866-277-4-WOW.  We have lots to do today, man.  Yes, yes.  Lots and lots of stuff to get to today.  It is Friday edition, yes.  I want to start by saying the word of the day today is Parker. 
[00:00:30]  The word of the day is Parker.  The word of the day is Parker.  The girl that's going to win the WOW contest.  Oh, you know her name?  What the...  Of course I know.  I pretty much know everything about her.  I, uh, no.  Huh?  I didn't even know her name. 
[00:01:00]  You don't like Parker?  What is going on at Dallas?  No, no, I said I didn't know her name.  Dallas has become the Sacramento in this WOW contest, Anthony.  The girls coming from Dallas are going to sweep this whole contest.  Yeah.  They got three beauties up there.  For one, we had to take down because, uh, she forgot to give ID.  So we're waiting to get her ID and then we'll put her pictures up.  That means they got four slamming girls in the WOW contest.  Ben, could you reboot my computer, please?  Good luck.  Everything's getting slammed today. 
[00:01:30]  Because people are really starting to check out the WOW contest on opianthony.com.  Yeah, the girl from Dallas, uh, the, the latest contestant from Dallas, um, unbelievable.  Yeah.  Yeah, the email just went nuts.  Because, uh, I guess her pictures went up late in the show yesterday.  We really couldn't spend too much time on Parker.  But, uh, man, if she's not the front runner right now.  I hope he convinced Playboy will be calling her.  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah.  She will win the WOW contest and she probably will end up in a gentleman's, uh, magazine. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, now it's just the gentleman's magazine.  Well, you know, we might, we might have to settle for swank or something.  Swank.  Can't reach too high.  No.  You know?  But, man.  And, uh, and, uh, and ladies, you can still qualify.  We had a real good week of qualifying.  Really, really good stuff came in this week.  And we look forward to more people stopping by the radio stations today and, uh, next week  to get their pictures done for the WOW contest.  $5,000 up for grabs, courtesy of risquevideo.com. 
[00:02:30]  We've told you in the past, these things start off slow.  Happens every time, doesn't it?  Yeah.  They start off a little slow.  We get, uh, some stragglers coming in.  And then it heats up.  It's starting to heat up big time.  And the voting gets very difficult.  We're so proud with the contestants that we're thinking of flying in the, uh, the ten finalists.  Top ten.  And just throwing a huge blowout road show.  A big road show blast.  So we can show off our, uh, the competition to everybody.  To everybody. 
[00:03:00]  Wouldn't that be great?  Just parade them out on stage.  All the hooting and hollering.  Hooting and hollering.  Hooting and hollering.  Anyway, a lot of email coming in.  And this is from Anthony.  And the subject is, holy ass Dallas.  What kind of hot bitch creation center is Dallas running?  There's got to be some type of genetic, uh, mutation camp where all the women just get hot.  And then he has, Dallas equals League of Super Friends.  Mm-hmm.  Philadelphia equals Legion of Doom. 
[00:03:30]  Oh.  And then he writes, love you, Ope.  Love you, Aunt.  Love you, Jimmy.  Why are people, why are people knocking Philly?  Well, there's another person that wrote, uh, this might explain it.  This is Jeremy from Philly.  So, Philly, don't get mad at me.  Don't kill the messenger.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, Jeremy writes, just a few observations of the WOW Contest.  Yeah.  All right.  Philly should pay more attention to quality than quantity. 
[00:04:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is from Jeremy, who lives in Philly.  Uh, two, Sacramento tried to get the hot streak back on track, but was quickly, uh, denied.  Mm-hmm.  Because they had one hot chick, and then someone else showed up at the station in Sacramento.  Yeah.  The hot streak is so over in Sacramento.  I know.  It's not even funny anymore.  Uh, number three, women don't have heads in Ohio.  And four, I'm moving to Dallas.  Yeah.  The, uh, Texas girls.  Wow.  So, there you have it.  You can check out the pictures for yourself. 
[00:04:30]  Opie and Anthony dot com.  We're not going to spend too much time, uh, with this contest on the radio.  It's more of an off-air thing, you know?  A visual thing.  But, uh, wow.  Dallas coming on really, really strong.  Let's go to Steve.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Steve.  Yeah.  Let's go, bro.  Hello.  Hey, what's that?  Language, you, you can't use the F word.  Let's get that straight today with everybody that has a, no F word.  I still got the Total Recall song stuck in my head.  I had it stuck all day yesterday. 
[00:05:00]  I couldn't even go to sleep.  Isn't it fun to sing, though?  Yeah.  Total Recallin'.  That song sucks.  Ah, ah.  Yeah, Total Recall was on, man.  A lot of people seem to like that song, so.  It's a great little song.  Don't play it again.  You can sing along to it.  What?  Don't play it again.  You want to?  What?  Are you tempting us, sir?  You want to hear?  Yeah, let's go.  Are you tempting us, Steve?  Of course.  You want to hear it again?  No, don't.  You know what?  Just for Steve, I'm going to just play the, uh. 
[00:05:30]  I'll take the line.  I'm going to play the riff all day long.  Total Recallin'.  Recallin'.  I love that the guy can't sing.  That's doing it.  The best.  We got to loop the part where he just says Total Recallin'.  We're going to play it all day long.  And I like to do this from time to time.  We get one of those awful songs.  Yeah.  And we, uh, make sure we get it stuck in your head.  And then all weekend long, you curse us.  It's completely trapped in there.  I should go about your business.  Ah, yes.  We acknowledge that this song blows, okay? 
[00:06:00]  I love it.  I've been dreaming of going to Mars where mutants drive fast because so I go there.  You know the rest, the best part is the girl with three breasts.  Total Recallin'. 
[00:06:30]  Total Recallin'.  You son of a bitch.  So I'm on Mars and I meet with her and I pull this big metallic thing out of my nose. 
[00:07:00]  Howdy, Quaid.  It makes me scream and shout.  No problemo.  And move my big robotic head all about.  Total Recallin'.  Total Recallin'.  Now we're having fun.  She's a party, Victor.  Total Recallin'. 
[00:07:30]  Hello, Cutie Pie.  One more time, fellas.  Total Recallin'.  Total Recallin'.  Total Recallin'.  I'm going to stop bawlin'.  I'm so sad.  I can't screw Sharon Stone.  How are you?  And Macaulay Culkin is left home all alone.  Oh, shit.  Total Recallin'. 
[00:08:00]  Total Recallin'.  Total Recallin'.  Total Recallin'.  Total Recallin'.  Total Recallin'.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Johnny, give me the bass.  Good morning.  You son of a bitch.  You're close.  Give me the bass.  Give them to me.  Now.  Alright.  Okay.  I don't think it's in tune.  I don't think it's in tune.  Alright.  There you have it.  Total Recallin'.  That song is up on foundrymusic.com, by the way.  We're getting a lot of requests for that.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Ah. 
[00:08:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Unofficial website, Anthony.  Yes.  It's been our unofficial website for about eight years now.  Uh-huh.  Unofficially speaking.  But, uh, go to foundrymusic.com.  There's a link off opiananthony.com to all the good stuff.  Also up on foundrymusic.com today is, uh, Norton's head on a lot of, uh, the WOW contestants.  Yeah.  Have you seen these, uh, Jimmy?  They're beyond hilarious.  I have not seen them.  Uh, they're working all our heads into the, into, uh, into the photos now, so.  I think mine molds nicer onto female bodies, though, because it's like a plump feminine quality to me. 
[00:09:00]  And they put, they, they frame, uh, your face with the hair and everything.  And it looks really good.  You got some hot bodies in some of them.  Thank you.  My favorite, though, is Anthony's head on the, uh, the piece of ass from Boston.  Yeah.  Because your, your expression, uh, works with the pose she's doing.  Right.  So, check it out for yourself on foundrymusic.com.  Steve does a great site.  A great job with that site.  Pugs and Kelly.  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[00:09:30]  Hello.  I'm from Dallas, Texas, everybody.  I gotta tell you, man, that, uh, latest contestant.  Ooh.  Which one?  Parker or Shea?  Parker.  Parker.  And they haven't even gotten Stephanie yet.  Oh, really?  Stephanie?  Uh-huh.  What's she like?  Good?  Yeah?  Stephanie's 19.  She's got this, she looks like, I described her as Pamela Anderson before she became a Pamdroid.  Remember when she first appeared in Playboy, the fresh face?  Very high, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Isn't that a Pamdroid?  Yeah, because that's what she is now.  She is.  Before she got the, the HEP.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Before she got all that Tommy Lee stink all over her.  Are you guys backing a bus up to the strip clubs over there or what?  No.  These, these girls aren't even strippers.  Some of them aren't.  Although it's, it's a little bit difficult because there are 106 strip clubs down here.  Yeah.  The strip capital of the world.  Yeah.  And, and Parker is not a stripper or is, or is she?  Nope.  Never stripped before in her life.  But you can check her out if you want to go to parkernude.com.  She does have a website.  That's right. 
[00:10:30]  Oh my God.  All good modern hose bags have a website.  And don't let the fake boobs throw you off because you don't have to be in Dallas,  you don't have to be a stripper to have the fake boobs.  Yeah.  Kind of a way of life.  Those are fake?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, but they look good, don't they?  They kind of looked really, uh, authentic.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a debate, but she caught the fact that they are in fact store-bought.  And, and who's making fun of all the New York girls down there saying that we don't  have tanning beds and stuff?  Well, that would be me.  Did you say that about tanning beds?  Yeah.  Flip a bluegill over and you see more color on the belly there than some of those chicks. 
[00:11:00]  Come on.  Summer's just beginning.  Aw.  I gotta tell you, a lot of our listeners are really bummed that New York isn't representing  as well as Dallas.  No.  We got a couple good ones from New York, but Dallas has blown us away so far.  Dallas is blowing everyone away, right?  Uh, without a doubt.  I don't know.  And you don't even have our best ones.  No.  They haven't even been sent yet.  Philly is getting ridiculous.  They're going for, uh, quantity instead of quality.  Yes, they are.  As one of our listeners wrote in the email.  I'm looking at one of Parker's pictures on a website here. 
[00:11:30]  Uh, wow, she likes the razor.  Yeah, she does.  She likes using the razor.  Look at that.  Yeah.  That's completely gone.  Good God.  No.  That's free stuff, right, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  This is, uh, I just take the tours on all these.  I never pay for the websites.  This is a great, um, contest.  The next one we're having for Dallas is, uh, the girls that have been raped by Eric Williams.  Oh, God.  You mean, girls who have partied in hotel rooms with Michael Irvin.  Yes.  That's the next one.  Right.  Well, thank you for sending up these, uh, wonderful, wonderful pictures. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, we look forward to the next one from Dallas.  You guys are crazy down there in Dallas at this point.  You shouldn't send us any pigs at this, you know?  No.  You guys got to keep the quality up, kind of like what Sacramento did in the last contest.  Yeah, you're ahead of the game now.  Don't go screwing it up.  You guys have to decide when the girls show up in, uh, at the station in Dallas, you know,  whether they're worthy or not to send our way.  Which ones?  The photos might get lost in the email and which ones?  Maybe something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Now, guys, first things first. 
[00:12:30]  You know, what the hell happened with Katana?  Katana is not on the site.  Is it because she's a dink?  Is that it?  Do you have, like, some guy who was locked in a...  You've got some guy choosing the girls for the contest who was locked in a tiger cage for seven  years?  No.  No!  No!  Did you just say first things first?  Well, yeah.  I mean, where is she?  She was our first girl in and now she's gone.  I heard that she didn't, uh, give an ID or something and then legally we can't put her  up on the website.  Yeah.  I don't want to put the cart before the horse, but is she going to be back up? 
[00:13:00]  Yes, she's going to be.  Yes, she will be.  You guys got to hunt her down because she needs to prove that she's of age and then we  can put her pictures back up.  But we know where she is.  That's all that's about.  You know what she does?  Huh?  She's in one of those modeling studios.  You know what I'm talking about?  Where do you pay to watch them for a few minutes?  Yeah.  You go in a little room and she rubs all over you.  See, that's the kind of...  Really?  That's a pretty skanky job.  And that's the kind of quality...  She's a peep show girl?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[00:13:30]  That's what our peep show girls look like.  That's quality.  Are you allowed to...  I actually one time for five bucks ate the balloon out of a Spanish stripper on 54th and  Broadway.  It's true.  The little window would open up and I put my head in and I gave her five and I was like...  Right in.  I had...  I had penny breath.  Oh, good Lord.  Yeah, you don't want to know what the girls at the peep shows in New York look like.  Yeah.  Awful.  Wounds.  Cesarean scars.  Yeah.  After leaving the peep show, I think she was smuggling heroin. 
[00:14:00]  Awful.  Awful.  I'm sorry.  We just had lunch.  That's unsettling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Norman.  All right.  Appreciate that.  Okay.  We just thought maybe there was some conspiracy in effect with Katana.  That maybe we were just giving too much quality and we were being...  Heather, we were limited to four spaces or something.  No, no, no.  You keep the quality up.  We'll keep it up.  Thank you very much, guys.  New York looked bad.  Yeah.  Nice-look New York broad.  Jesus.  Well, there's a couple good ones.  No, there's no good ones. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  Yes.  The girl in the cast of school skirt.  She was nice.  Very cute.  We can all agree that Chicago is just a bunch of pigs now.  Hold on.  Chicago gave us a really hot girl and just a mess.  Yeah.  The one girl with the natural boobs I like a lot.  I don't know her name, but...  Is that the one drinking the martini or something?  No, she's...  Oh, that one makes me laugh.  She couldn't even put the drink down for the photo shoot.  She just looks hammered.  God bless Chicago for that.  She didn't care if she's got a martini or a Cosmopolitan during the photo shoot. 
[00:15:00]  That's what happens when they close down the stockyards, sir.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a second.  We've got some callers that want to know if Norton's ever going to come to Dallas.  Is that a possibility?  Yeah.  It'll be a little while, but I will get down to Dallas.  I'm working on Sacramento next, but I will definitely get down to Dallas.  Norton's very funny.  Thank you.  We love them.  All right.  We don't want to bother you guys.  We have bigger things to do than Tuck.  No bother.  That's cool, man.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Sophie and Anthony from...  It's Pugs and Kelly, everybody. 
[00:15:30]  There they go.  God, they do have some hotties down there in Texas, though.  That drinking one.  I like that one from Chicago.  It's drinking, man.  That's what I like.  Isn't that great?  She's got the drink in her hand.  I have no problem.  She looks like the nanny.  She's having fun with the whole damn thing, you know?  Drinking and blacking out, unable to testify.  There's another contestant.  She has a tattoo that she obviously got...  Oh, God, I need the picture.  She got the tattoo when she was a lot younger.  Yeah.  And now she's getting a little heftier and stuff, and it looks like the belly button 
[00:16:00]  is eating the tattoo.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you're going to get some tats on your belly or your ass or something...  It's like the belly button is turning into a black hole.  Ah.  It's just sucking the tattoo inward.  I mean, you've got to realize that in time, unless you're going to dedicate your life  a man in shape, those tats are going to look really bad.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Yeesh.  Remember Cher?  Remember Cher when she did her video with her son?  This is going back years ago.  Elijah Blue.  Yeah, and she had those fishnet stockings on, and it just looked like someone shot each  ass cheek with a paint gun.  These big blobs, and you know she got them a little while back, you know?  She's younger, and then it just looked like this big faded purple ink blots on her ass.  Girls, you've got to watch where you put those things. 
[00:17:00]  Enough with the tattoos already.  I mean, they're nice, but just enough already.  Constantly on the back with the tribal.  Stop.  I like the...  Hold on.  Jim, shut the...  Shut up.  Why?  That is really hot and sexy when they get the right tattoo.  It can be, but everyone's getting the same thing.  What is your problem?  I love the one right above the crack.  I don't mind it.  That is the hottest thing going.  As long as they don't make them too big.  Sometimes they have to take over the whole area down there.  They have no connection to the American Indians.  Who cares, Jim?  Like what, does that mean something?  I don't know. 
[00:17:30]  I hear Ozzy's daughter has a tat.  Well, that's Ozzy's daughter, man.  That's different.  Just always take it there with Jimmy.  Maybe it'll solve the problem.  It does.  I really...  You don't know what they're actually writing in tribal language.  I'm just amazed that, you know, the whole thing where girls are getting a lot of tattoos these days.  There are some girls that are just covered.  Like it used to be only Navy guys or bikers had this many tats on.  And you gotta wonder, when they're in that old age home or, you know, grandma's sitting there and being taken care of by people, what that has to look like on a body that resembles ETs. 
[00:18:00]  We saw Century Sex.  We got the video around here.  It's like a hundred-year-old broad just getting pounded by some guy.  And she looks like a skeleton head.  And all her organs have sunk down into her pelvis area.  The boobs are just stretched down to her hips.  And her body is wrinkled and just disgusting.  Could you imagine that with tats all over?  I was going to say, and not having a tattoo is going to make that whole mess better? 
[00:18:30]  No, no.  It isn't.  Who cares?  But I'm just saying...  At that point, who cares?  It just...  It would seem to me to be really odd at that age.  No one looks silly when you're, you know, a rock star past your prime.  Yeah.  And then you take your shirt off for a national TV show then.  It's kind of...  Oh, Jesus.  If you're a guy, it's different.  When you're a guy, you're a guy.  When you're a chick, I don't need to see that when I'm ready to...  At the time, Ozzy was all muscular and...  When?  When was Ozzy muscular? 
[00:19:00]  No, he wasn't.  Those tattoos looked all...  Dude, he tattooed himself in jail.  All nice and stuffed.  He was in jail and he tattooed himself.  He's a bad dude.  And you're right.  The operative word being rock star, not chick from Ron Konkama.  He's a rock star.  All right?  When I'm banging a chick, I don't want to see some stupid bulldog with USMC on it.  That's my dad's tattoo.  I don't need that on a 20-year-old.  That might mean she's not a chick.  Yeah, you better.  I've never seen a chick with that tattoo.  All right.  I was exaggerating a little bit.  All right.  Just with the tribal thing.  All right. 
[00:19:30]  Stop.  All right.  Daddy Norton has spoken.  Stop it with that.  I like the daddy thing, too.  I don't like the tribal tattoo.  No, I don't mind.  They're not bad.  Everyone's getting it.  Get something different.  Ah, Mikey.  My two favorite crackers.  What's going on now?  What's up, Mike, my nigga?  What's up, my baby?  All right.  Now, listen.  Y'all can get rid of that fat black girl.  She's got the girl.  She's got the girl.  She's representing the whole black community in the WoW contest.  No, no.  She does not know.  No, no, no.  I mean, she's big enough, and usually I don't discriminate, but seeing all the nice, you know, 
[00:20:00]  squirt itself on top of the list, and you scroll down, and there she is, way at the bottom.  Who's that from?  Philly?  I think she was in real world London.  No.  No.  She's the continent of London, whatever that means.  All right.  You don't like the black representation in our WoW contest.  No, no, no, no.  One quick thing before I go.  Yeah.  Please get Earl.  Earl showed up at a sticker stop with three WoW shirts.  I'm sorry I called yesterday, and poor girl showed up.  Get Earl. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Earl is filling in for Scott Farrell today, who decided not to come to work.  What a mess this radio station is in.  Scott just decided not to show up for work today.  Our morning guy is getting closer to just completely self-destructing.  I hope not.  We love the guy.  We want to help him through this tough time.  All I heard was he decided not to show up, and then the station, I don't know, all of a sudden  we went into political talk this morning here in New York City.  Who was doing the show?  I don't even know.  Was it Earl? 
[00:21:00]  Huh?  No.  No, it wasn't Earl.  Hi, Mike.  I just know there was a lot of yelling in Jeremy's office.  Was that true?  Yesterday.  Oh, some guy from Atlanta?  Talking politics.  Yeah, well, they beat the crap out of Scott Farrell after his show every day, and then  he comes into our office and drinks heavily.  Yeah.  And then decides if he's going to show up or not.  Happy hour.  I guess yesterday was a tough day, so he got sick.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  A little sick and decided not to come in.  So, at this point, here in New York City, we've got a morning show. 
[00:21:30]  He's very talented, but, you know, he's got problems right now.  It's official.  We're looking for a new midday show here in New York City.  Yes.  Looking for a new midday show.  We're in a lot of cities all over the country.  If you want to send your tapes, send them in.  Mm-hmm.  Help us out.  Starting Monday, quick stop for the New York audience.  We get our 2 o'clock hour back.  Yes.  In New York, you will hear the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:22:00]  Starting at 2 o'clock.  2 o'clock.  It's mostly best of and stuff, but if there's something really good happening, we go on live  at 2.  And then in an unbelievable move, Anthony.  An unbelievable move.  Unprecedented.  Because we really don't know who's going to do middays yet here in New York.  Mm-hmm.  Ron and Fez, everyone knows they're our pals.  They're on after us here in New York City.  Yes.  We're going to live and do middays live from, what, 10 to 2, I believe.  Yeah.  Then we're going on at 2 with like a, you know, a repeat hour. 
[00:22:30]  Then we're live from 3 to 7.  And then Ron and Fez are going to do their regular show from 7 to 11.  They're going to do eight hours of radio a day for the next week or two.  They will be doing two shifts.  Two shifts.  Holy cow.  And every so often, I believe, we'll be popping in during their shift in middays.  Nah.  Just hanging out with them.  Yeah.  We're going to hang with them.  We'll pop in and hang out.  It's just going to be a big cluster F.  We're going to do a lot of afro shows with Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  In middays for the next couple weeks.  It's going to get very interesting starting next week here in New York City. 
[00:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  At this radio station.  A lot of fun.  And why don't we take our first break.  Wow.  Who is this one on the WOW Contest?  Natalie from Sacramento.  What, a new one?  Look at the cans on this front.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's very nice.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  It's a WOW Contest, Rick.  No, she's very nice.  Jesus.  Earl's checking in really fast here.  Earl, what's up?  Ah, yeah.  Let's keep the energy up. 
[00:23:30]  Earl, what are you up to?  Let's go, Earl!  Hey, guys.  We're on the LIE.  Stuck on the LIE.  On our way to Belmont Racetrack.  Belmont.  She did it.  And I'm filling in for Scott Burrell, who was out sick today.  So, we're on our way.  We'll be there from 5 to 7 p.m.  Earl, where are you going to be at Belmont?  We are going to be in Sunset Park.  You're going to be able to place a bet?  I'm sorry.  What horse?  What horse?  I'll check the paper, and you've got to go in and make a bet for me.  Okay.  That's cool. 
[00:24:00]  Okay.  All right.  So, what are you doing over there?  We're just hanging out, handing out shirts, Budweiser stuff, and there's going to be drink  specials from Budweiser.  Oh.  Are you going to be on the front lawn just holding a lantern?  Oh.  Oh.  You are evil.  You know that?  Oh, man.  Well.  I don't.  Yeah, me with the road crew and Laura.  Thanks, Tommy.  Thanks, Tommy.  All right, Earl.  Call us when you get there, all right?  All right, guys.  Plenty of wow stickers for the gang at the track today.  Earl.  Earl.  Hey, Earl. 
[00:24:30]  He's not trying to get you.  I'm not trying to get you.  I really want to ask you something.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  He's not trying to get you.  I'm not trying to get you.  I really want to ask you something.  Earl.  Earl.  Are you going to sing de-camptown races?  No, I am not going to sing de-camptown races.  How about a verse?  I'm not going to sing de-camptown races.  No, I am not going to sing de-camptown races.  How about a version of Old Man River?  No, I am not singing Old Man River.  The camp town ladies sing de-song, doo-dah, doo-dah.  Camp town racetrack, five miles long, oh-dee-doo-dah day. 
[00:25:00]  That's not fair.  That's one of the funniest things from Blazing Saddles.  I know.  Well, I just figured at the racetrack, you could sing the song for us.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  He's never kidding.  Master got me working.  Sunday master set me free.  Oh, Christ.  All right. 
[00:25:30]  I want to play the peep show girl thing.  Because Dallas was bragging that that hot piece of ass is a peep show girl.  Yeah.  Got a little tune from Stephen Lynch.  Yeah, right?  Let me go to break.  See you there, behind the glass.  I drop a quarter in the slot and then I watch you as you shake that ass. 
[00:26:00]  I watch you grind.  I watch you dance.  I show you mine, you show me yours, and when we're done I button up my pants.  And my friends all laugh, my friends all scoff when I say I love a girl loves to take it off.  But I tell them that they're crazy cause I've been around the world and there's nothing wrong, nothing with my peep show. 
[00:26:30]  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  Girl, no.  No, there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong.  I love your mind.  I love your soul.  I love it when you grease your body and you slide it up and down that pole.  Yeah.  I love your hair.  I love your eyes.  And I know that you feel the same way cause I can see the love dripping down your thighs. 
[00:27:00]  And my momma would laugh, my momma would scoff if she knew I loved a girl, loved to take it off.  And she'd probably disown me if she met my little pearl.  But there's nothing wrong, momma, with my peep show.  Girl, no.  No, there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong. 
[00:27:30]  So now I'm broke.  You bled me dry.  Ain't it so amazing how much money that a guy'll spend to taste a little pie?  But I'm okay.  I'm a little sore.  I can't believe that I found love in a place where my feet stick to the floor.  And I went to confession and the preacher said, 
[00:28:00]  No, it's a single of a girl who isn't pure as driven snow.  I said, Preacher, I don't care, man.  I found heaven in this world.  And there's nothing wrong, a preacher, with my peep show.  Girl, no.  I said there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong, with my peep show.  Girl, no.  Yeah.  Steven Lynch, everyone. 
[00:28:30]  All right, Steve.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got a bitches out of bitches, but first we've got to go back to Earl.  Yeah.  You want him to bet on a horse for you, right?  Yes.  Earl?  Earl?  Yo.  How you doing?  I'm stuck in traffic, but it's DLA on a Friday.  What are you going to do?  Absolutely.  Well, Earl, when you get to Belmont, tell everyone where you're going to be real quick.  We're going to be at Belmont Racetrack.  We're going to be at the Sunset Racing Happy Hour 10 from 5 to 7. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, Earl.  Yes.  They won't let you ride inside the van?  It sounds like you're calling from the outside of the vehicle.  Well, we've got all the windows open because the air conditioning isn't working.  Earl, how are you going to hand out stickers when you're shoveling out the stalls?  It is kind of ironic.  They ask me a lawn jockey to make a bet on horse racing.  Oh, God.  Earl?  Yeah?  Um, I have my two horses for the fourth race. 
[00:29:30]  Uh?  You will be there by the fourth race, won't you?  Post time's at three for the first, so.  I said fourth race, yeah.  You should be there.  Okay.  Are you ready?  I want a $2 Xacta box.  Writing this down?  Yes, I am.  Horse number one, read me my rights.  Okay.  I'll kill you both when I get there. 
[00:30:00]  But it's an Xacta, so it's two horses.  And Boone's Mask.  I'm sorry, I didn't hear the second one.  The number three horse, Boone's Mask.  It's a $2 Xacta box, read me my rights, and Boone's Mask.  Got it?  Yes, sir.  If you have any difficulty betting this, ask someone.  Don't F this up.  What's my cut in this? 
[00:30:30]  It's going to cost you $4 to make that bet, by the way.  I'm saying if you win, what's my cut?  You'll get nothing like it.  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Get that in.  We'll see how that works.  I'll tell you when I get there.  Last year, Stinky went out to Belmont.  I made an Xacta bet.  And Stinky calls up, you won $90.  And you let it ride, right?  I was like, let it ride.  Let it ride.  $90 on the nose.  Why are you only getting $2 bets? 
[00:31:00]  I don't understand that.  Exactly.  Can't you bet $20?  But I don't know if he's got it on him.  Believe me, I'd bet more than that.  But he's got to dish it out first.  I don't know how much money he's got.  He doesn't have $40 on him.  Glenn?  Yeah?  What's up, Glenn?  Hey, ask Earl if he can use his food stamps and bet on a dark horse for me at Belmont.  Leave it to Boston.  Thank you, Boston.  Bet on a dark horse.  Have the colored guy bet on a dark horse.  Have a couple beers, you movie.  The worst. 
[00:31:30]  The worst.  Goddamn Boston has got to be the most racist city on the face of the earth.  Awful people.  South Africans laugh at Boston.  Whenever we have comments like that on this show, it's always Boston.  Let's get some of that apartheid.  Oh, yeah.  It's a bitches out of bitches.  Sing it, Joe Pesci.  This is really Joe Pesci.  It's a bitches out of bitches.  Joe Pesci decided he was going to put out a rap album.  It's a bitches out of bitches.  Are you going to criticize him? 
[00:32:00]  I hope he did.  I thought he was going to come down here and whack you.  It's the bitches out of bitches.  And we got a good one today.  Front page of the New York Papers.  From the never-ending divorce of Donna Hanover and ex-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  Everyone knows Rudy at this point after the 9-11 thing.  Of course, everyone knows who Rudy is.  I don't know how many people across the country know, though, he has been in a heated divorce  even before 9-11.  This was like a big story. 
[00:32:30]  Married to Donna Hanover.  She was a news broad, bit actress, and C-word.  I cannot stand this effing woman.  She is everything that is wrong with divorce law.  You got to give us some history, Anthony.  Yeah.  There was a time that the mayor was still living in the mansion, and he was going through some  prostate crap, some prostate cancer, and he was seeing doctors and all that and getting 
[00:33:00]  treatment for that.  Gracie Manchin is the mayor's residence here in New York City.  Every mayor in every city across the country has a mayor's residence that is your privilege  that you were elected mayor and you get a residence to conduct your life out of.  And he was under a lot of stress and pressure going through all these treatments and still  living in the mansion even though he was separated from Donna Hanover.  Yeah.  Donna Hanover had the room directly above the mayor. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  And she chose to get up at like four, five in the morning to exercise and stuff to drive  him out of his mind.  Yeah.  Right above him.  Like there isn't enough room in the place.  And then the ultimate, she went to court and had him thrown out of the mayor's residence.  Yeah.  The women do this all the time.  The guy is in the house.  They're married.  Whatever.  They get a divorce.  The guy goes.  The woman keeps the house. 
[00:34:00]  And then it's the mayor's residence, the official residence of the mayor.  How does that make sense?  Did you vote for this bitch so she could have the mayor's residence?  No.  Rudy won the election.  He gets thrown out.  He winds up having to shack up with one of his gay buddies.  He was shacking up with a friend of his in some little apartment trying to conduct business.  Now, don't get me wrong.  Everyone knows a lot of people couldn't stand this son of a bitch, Rudy Giuliani, for many  years that he was in charge of New York. 
[00:34:30]  He did a great job in the city.  He cleaned up New York, as they say.  It's already coming in though, Ant.  Look at this.  Tony.  Tony.  Yes.  Go ahead real fast.  No, F Giuliani, man.  He promised the cops, I'm a cop myself, big raises when he got elected.  We helped him get elected and he screwed us.  He gave himself and the rest of the city council, big raises.  I was getting into that.  That's what I was saying.  Everybody, you know, you hated this guy because he was taking a lot of the credit for cleaning  up New York. 
[00:35:00]  But in the meantime, he was overworking the police and not giving them the money that they  were deserving.  What do you think?  Rudy was out there on the streets cleaning up New York?  No.  He gave it to the cops, the responsibility.  He gave them a little more leeway in what they could do, more so than that Dinkins piece  of garbage that was in office for many years while the riots were going on.  The blacks are beating up the Jews.  It was a circus, this city.  They weren't even Rudy's ideas.  He took them from Timoney, Bratton, any other heads of the police department. 
[00:35:30]  He took all the credit for it and he didn't do any of the work.  Regardless, you know, it's the same thing that happens with any leader that gets into office.  They get the credit.  I don't even want to get here because this is about Donna Hanover and what a twat she  is.  Look.  You know?  Thank you, Tony.  So, yeah, people couldn't stand the guy.  Or a lot of people.  But we've said that many times on the show.  Yeah.  That's a given.  He hated us.  He had our show arrested.  The guy had our program arrested.  So, you know. 
[00:36:00]  What was the total?  Like 18 people associated with the show got arrested?  18 people?  Oh, the exact number.  I think the number goes up every time we bring it up.  Got arrested and it was directly his order.  And he called this show stupid.  Hey, Anthony.  You think when Rudy Giuliani was living with his gay friend?  Yeah.  Then in the middle of the night the gay friend is gone.  Hey, Rudy.  Rudy.  I'm sleeping.  Stop it.  I'm sleeping.  Stop it.  I'm sleeping.  Hey, Rudy.  Hey, Rudy. 
[00:36:30]  No one has to know.  It's just you and me, Rudy.  Shut up, Richard.  I'm sleeping.  Rudy, are you sleeping?  I want to give you a hummer, Rudy.  Stupid.  Stupid.  That's Rudy talking about this show.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.  That's Rudy talking about this show.  Stupid.  Stupid.  He had to go on TV and tell everyone our show was stupid.  And why he had our show arrested.  Look at us getting in trouble with another mayor.  It was, yeah, it was a lot of fun.  But let me tell you something.  This guy, regardless of the day, he's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man. 
[00:37:00]  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  He's a man.  And regardless, you liked him, hated him.  When September 11th rolled around, he became a national figure.  He became a symbol of control and power in New York.  He took the reins.  And can I interrupt you? 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Dan from Hoboken.  Because Earl is filling in for Scott Farrell, who's a major radio talent.  And, you know, he was sick today.  He had to go do his appearance for him.  Yeah.  Dan writes, so fans are expecting Farrell and instead they get Earl.  That must be like buying half oregano.  Yo, man, this is soap chips.  Sorry.  So the mayor's in this mess.  Then he became a national figure.  You know, we all know who Rudy Giuliani is.  He showed the courage and the power. 
[00:38:00]  You've seen the whole schmear.  Well, he's still in this divorce.  And I guess they made a judgment on how much support Donna Hanover was going to get.  Now, this broad makes enough money on her own.  Believe me.  She's always in these stupid movies.  Whatever.  You know, she's able to support herself.  But here's what she was asking for Rudy to give her.  $80,000 a month in support.  She needs $80,000 a month to live. 
[00:38:30]  Is that child support or just her support?  Oh, no.  No, no.  This is including.  It says $80,000 a month in support, including $40,590 in child support.  $30,277 in alimony.  And another $10,258 per month for add-on child support expenses.  And then this is just.  This one was thrown in as a piss off point, they call it. 
[00:39:00]  Just to piss them off.  $1,140 in monthly expenses for the family dog.  $1,140 a month for the dog's expenses.  What do you think is worse, Anthony?  Rudy trying to run away from the towers as they're collapsing or Rudy trying to run away from Donna Hanover's lawyers?  He's got the little kerchief over his nose running down the street. 
[00:39:30]  The lawyers are after me.  I mean, here's the guy that was on TV.  He was right down there when it happened.  Gets on TV when everybody is tuning in just going,  What the F?  What does this mean?  What's going to happen in New York City?  How are the police and fire departments?  Is everyone going to deal with this?  He gets on and, I mean, he pulled it all together.  He showed that he was a true leader.  You think he's going to remember the day he was married? 
[00:40:00]  When he just goes to trial?  No.  Do you mean the wedding day?  Yeah.  I remember mine, May 19th.  Maynard is very pissed off at you.  Why?  Maynard, love your band.  What's up?  Yo, man.  Where the hell are you getting all this information?  He pulled it together?  Yeah.  What together?  It's all catchphrases, man.  What did he actually do?  How did he show the leader?  Look, look, look.  I'm not going to get into this because we are now, what, nine months,  over nine months past September 11th? 
[00:40:30]  Dude, would I be the only one that was saying this crap?  Oh, man.  People forget so quickly.  In the goddamn hours after the towers fell down, who was on TV?  Who was getting the headlines about being a great leader?  Who was invited to address Congress?  Who went to Washington?  Who was giving New York all their information, Maynard?  And who's going to end up being the president one day because of this?  And what did he actually do other than be on the news?  I don't know.  I won't vote for him because he's a scumbag.  Can you liberals ever just stop with your typical predictable line? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, F you, Jimmy.  At least when you're going with revisionist history, could you wait longer than nine months  before you get revisionist history started?  Maynard, this is what happened.  No.  You don't remember nine months ago, you fool?  Oh, come on.  Don't be calling me a fool.  Come on, what?  So what then did Mayor Giuliani do or not do right after the 11th?  That's what I am asking you.  All right.  You're the one who's giving him the BJ.  Predictable, dumb liberal.  Maynard, you don't honestly think that the mayor has something to do with emergency management 
[00:41:30]  during situations like that?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I don't think that he did nothing, but you guys, you know, you have no evidence to  back up what you're saying.  No evidence.  Of course you don't think that.  You're alternative and smart and a little too hip for the rules.  And do you have any evidence to back up that he did nothing?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I believe just seeing the way that the various departments that he heads handled the situation,  that perhaps he had his hand in it. 
[00:42:00]  Maynard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything else?  No, I guess I got nothing else to say, boys.  Yeah.  Later.  All right.  When's the new album coming out?  What an ass.  They're just the worst.  What an ass.  I'm not kissing the guy's ass.  Like I said, if you ran for the president, I wouldn't vote for him because he's a scumbag.  I love him and I would vote for him.  And he did a great job with 9-11.  And you know what?  You saw what happened when a little crisis broke out when Dinkins was in office.  He couldn't handle Crown Heights.  He never would have handled 9-11, you dope. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  So don't tell me that it means nothing who's in charge.  I mean, I'm not saying that he did everything.  The cops and the firemen are the ones that made the sacrifices.  But don't tell me that organizational skills mean nothing.  That's what it's all about.  Disorganizing, finding things that had to be done.  They are the worst.  And having the proper people in the position that you can then delegate responsibility to.  Of course.  But people like to, whatever.  Anyway.  They're the worst.  He handled the situation.  Yet, even after all that, becoming a national hero, which he did, he still has to deal with 
[00:43:00]  a bitch that wants $1,140 for her dog.  That, that's the kick in the nuts right there.  That he has to deal with her asking for $1,100 for a goddamn dog dying time.  Hi.  It's the bitches that will truly get you. 
[00:43:30]  What's the bitches that don't get here?  It's the bitches that don't get here.  It's the bitches that are getting here.  Go, Lee!  Their dog's name is Go, Lee.  Go, Lee!  Go, Lee!  It's the bitches that are getting here.  See, the food for the son cost him that much.  Oh, poor kid he's got.  He's a rail.  He's got his mother's ass, I'll tell you that.  You ever see Donahan over his ass?  Maybe those figures aren't too blown out of proportion.  You've got to feed that big ass of hers that she sits on and does nothing. 
[00:44:00]  You know what?  As annoying as she is, as she really is aggravating, Rudy brought this on himself.  When you're the mayor, you can't parade another chick around when you're married.  You can't do it.  F her, man.  Why not?  Why not?  Maybe he wasn't getting what he wanted from his wife.  I'm not saying that she's not an annoying, digging for too much money,  but you can't be that public with it and just parade her around to events 
[00:44:30]  and not expect to get F'd in the divorce.  No, maybe that's the only way he could get her back.  It doesn't matter.  You can't do that.  A big-time C-rag behind closed doors.  Right.  You're probably right.  You're talking about absolutely nothing for many, many F'd in years,  and he finally lost his mind and said,  you know what?  Screw everyone.  I'm F'd in this chick, and I'm going to bring her around in public.  Dude, you're probably right,  but when you do something that obvious in front of that many people,  you leave the court no choice but to go,  you know what, man?  Oh, my.  Because the court has no bearing on it.  You know something?  You're saying, either way, she's going to screw him over.  The court isn't even supposed to consider crap like that, 
[00:45:00]  and they do, and it disgusts me.  That isn't even an issue.  Rudy already knew he was going to lose his shirt on this one,  but he probably said, you know what, this is one way to get her back.  I'm going to parade this, in his mind, this piece of ass all over the place,  and it's going to drive her nuts.  Before it was public, what I'm saying is he was doing things almost with her as a girlfriend,  a little more subtle, but really starting to bring her public  while people didn't even know what was going on.  I'm like, well, he's married.  He's got this.  There was talk about him.  Everyone knew.  That's what I'm saying.  Everyone knew for years.  Before he even had the girlfriend, everyone knew that the marriage was a farce. 
[00:45:30]  She wouldn't show up at huge events, and he won all kinds of awards,  and his wife wasn't even there, Adam.  They knew.  Everyone knew.  And before her, he was running around with another pig.  Dude, and again, I love Rudy, but again, Donna, I'm not saying she's got a C,  and she's not going to get more than she should in the divorce.  I say good for Rudy.  Do it publicly.  Why?  He was going to lose either way.  But he's losing.  The numbers weren't going to be the same no matter if he did it the right way or the wrong way.  Maybe, yeah.  So maybe this was his way of just going, you know what? 
[00:46:00]  Look what I'm doing, you bitch.  Look what I do now.  Look at this.  And she has a thin ass, and she's hot.  I mean, he paraded her at the Yankee games and everywhere.  Adultery is a big one, though.  I mean, say in the courts, you can't fight adultery.  It is not supposed to reflect any settlements, though.  Adultery does, doesn't it, for reasons?  Hell no.  No, no, no.  It's a grounds for divorce.  Believe me.  But it's not supposed to reflect on any settlement.  You can't say, all right, we're getting divorced because we're incompatible. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, now you get less money than you do from the adultery divorce?  No.  It's supposed to have no bearing on it.  They like to pound the issue so the stupid judges might think, well, now she went through  a lot of crap.  They're not supposed to consider the reason for the divorce when it comes to the settlement.  It's purely financial.  We need somebody really just a little more brilliant than the rest of us.  Someone kind of hip with an alternative point of view.  I wish that Maynard would call back and really give us a dose of what they're thinking on  that side of the tracks. 
[00:47:00]  Maynard.  What are the young, really hip, bright people thinking, man?  Another douche.  I like girls who don't shave under their arms, man.  If Dinkins was in office during September 11th, he'd have flown over to Afghanistan to  go bedside with the terrorist relatives.  And apologize.  And apologize.  And the buildings being in the way while they were flying.  Exactly.  Stunk.  Remember every time there'd be a drug dealer that got shot by the cops and with him in  office, man, every, every drug dealer had spokespeople and everything else that would 
[00:47:30]  get on the news and say it was police brutality every time.  And Dinkins, instead of going and talking with the cops, would go bedside with the wounded  drug dealers or go to the drug dealer's parents, parent, God knows the pops wasn't around,  and apologize and sit there and say, we're going to look into this and see if the police  acted, you know, until Giuliani got in there and, you know, said, hey, this is the deal.  You've got drug dealers in your neighborhood and the cops come in and there's crap and they 
[00:48:00]  get hurt.  You know, that's part of the bargain.  And the problem is when you ask dummies like that guy that called in, what don't you  like about him?  They're so following the company line like, oh, he's just, he's a Nazi.  Well, why?  They're here.  Yeah, they never have an answer for him.  I agree with everything he did.  I didn't like the whole Brooklyn Art Museum thing.  I'll agree with you on that.  Never Bob, never Bob Grant here in New York used to call Dinkins and that washroom attendant,  the mayor washroom attendant. 
[00:48:30]  And then he was talking about the riots in Crown Heights where blacks and Jews were constantly,  well, let's be straight, the blacks were beating up the Jews.  That's pretty much what happened.  They like to call it fights, but no, the blacks are going and beat them.  And Bob Grant would be like, and once again, the savages have struck in Crown Heights.  He got in so much trouble back then.  It was classic radio.  Jethro.  Yo, yo.  What up?  What's up, guys?  Now, I was saying about the Giuliani thing. 
[00:49:00]  What kind of cold-hearted C puts her husband in an opposite room when he's in remission of cancer?  You know what I mean?  What does that speak for her?  Well, he said she gave him no support during his prostate cancer, and the girlfriend that he had was completely supportive.  And at a time like that, you can only imagine what it must be like to be going through that and have a wife then that might even be.  I don't know, but could you imagine if you have a wife that's going, good, I hope that kills you.  You've been a pain in my ass, and now I'm glad you have one in yours. 
[00:49:30]  All crap like that.  How then are you going to respond to that?  I'm only playing devil's advocate, but if I was with a girl and she was cheating on me and she came down with ovarian cancer, good for her.  Get it.  Good.  I hope it eats away at your energy hole.  You know, believe me, I don't like Donna Hanover, but I'm saying if she knew he was having an affair.  I think you're right.  I think that's like human nature.  Yeah, I don't blame her for not being supportive.  Like, you know, because again, I don't like her, but it's humiliating to have your husband as the mayor cheating on you publicly,  and you get to still walk around and face people.  Everybody knows he's banging someone else. 
[00:50:00]  That's why I'm saying it was a bad move by him.  It's stupid.  Okay, devil's advocate.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good movie, actually.  I'm kidding, Kev.  All right, look at that break.  Maynard.  Maybe my parents were hip for naming me Maynard.  This concludes this serious portion of the Opie and Anthony show.  Bring on the whores, next.  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication, and this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand, 
[00:50:30]  whether we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio, and here's what he writes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request,  but I'm quite sincere, and it'll mean a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles, but he was most certainly a part of...  Let's come start again.  I'm coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please. 
[00:51:00]  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those transitions,  and then you've got to go into somebody dying.  And, you know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for, but goddamn it, if we can't come out of a slow record,  I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a f***ing up-tempo record  every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week. 
[00:51:30]  It's the last goddamn time.  I want somebody who's his f***ing brain to not come out of a goddamn record  that's up-tempo, and I've got to talk about a f***ing dog dying.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40 has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning and every Saturday morning at 2.  2?  Well, this is f***ing ponderous, man.  Ponderous, f***ing ponderous. 
[00:52:00]  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in New York City, 877-692-1027.  Outside of the city, anywhere else in the country, 866-2774.  Wow.  I think we're done with the Rudy thing, huh?  Yeah.  Mike has a quick comment, and then we'll move on.  Yes, Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  One last thing before we move on to the Rudy Giuliani little topic here.  I just want to say that, you know, no matter what guy you are, whether you be Bill Clinton, 
[00:52:30]  Rudy Giuliani, you know, the Satan of the world or the devil, you know, no man deserves to  go through a divorce like that.  You know, $1,000 for a dog?  I mean, come on.  Yeah, I agree.  You know?  The figures are so overinflated in divorce cases that it's ridiculous.  You can't look at anybody that deserves $80,000 a month to live.  Who lives on $80,000 a month?  Who the hell spends that kind of cash?  Exactly. 
[00:53:00]  Stop it.  It just shows that the males have just lost, like, all the power, you know?  It's like the women, you know, we can't even, you know, we lose our house.  You know, Rudy, you have to move out of the mansion?  Are you effing kidding me?  And that isn't bad enough.  It's like right when the whole proceedings start, the second it's like, all right, we're  getting a divorce.  The guy has to leave the house.  And in most cases, I'll say most cases.  Can we say it again?  The guy works.  Really fast.  The mayor of New York City had to leave the mansion, the mayor's mansion, and move in 
[00:53:30]  with a gay guy, a friend of his.  How does that happen?  How does that happen?  If Bill Clinton and Hillary would have started divorce proceedings, say, hypothetically, would  he have had to have left the White House?  Based on this, yes.  Could you imagine Hillary living in the White House during that time and Bill having to live,  you know, at a hotel with a gay friend?  And, you know, there are some nice girls out there, and, you know, they're getting a bad  rap because, you know, all the women out there are just getting bad publicity where, you 
[00:54:00]  know, it seems like 90% of them are just out there, you know, ready to cutthroat, you know?  I find it funny because a lot of women, they want the equal rights and stuff.  But they turn their head when it comes to something like this, and they accept this  part of it.  And it is such a subtle way, whether people believe it or not, of keeping them a second-class  citizen.  It's a way, when you're a superior, and you're doling out little things to an inferior being,  like little extra privileges, there's a way of staying superior to them.  Women are constantly getting what they want with divorces, like all of a sudden, why 
[00:54:30]  does the guy have to leave?  Why?  It's because she's deemed as helpless and not quite as good, not quite as capable.  Right, capable of supporting herself.  And in the older days, perhaps that was true, because women didn't get the opportunities  for the schooling and the jobs and whatnot.  But that's changed.  But the laws, they haven't changed.  I understand they need to get a fair settlement.  And the kids and stuff, yeah.  But this is beyond fair.  You can't leave them destitute.  That's not what it's about.  But it's become just a screw factor.  And getting away from the high profile, the guy screwed her over, the girl screwed him 
[00:55:00]  over kind of thing with a divorce.  There are many divorces that are just based on the fact that the couple is not in love  anymore.  It's all that happened.  There's no beatings going on.  There's no screws, you know, turning the screw going on.  Perhaps you just fall out of love and want to move on now with your individual lives.  It just doesn't happen.  The lawyers get involved.  And now there's more animosity between what goes on in the court than ever happened in 
[00:55:30]  the marriage.  So the laws, and they'll never be changed.  There's no way to even imagine that that's ever going to change.  It's just something that's got to be dealt with.  And if anyone's getting married, it doesn't matter what you're doing, if you're a ditch  digger, the world needs ditch diggers too, you know, get a prenup.  It doesn't matter.  They challenge that in court anyway because, again, it's that helpless victim thing.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I was signing.  Well, that's why you need a good lawyer to write it up.  Ironclad, they call it. 
[00:56:00]  It's amazing.  You can't just have two people and you go, you know what?  Yeah, you're right.  I'll sign this no more.  It's got to have the lawyers involved.  And then I've read a lot of stuff where girls go like, I won't sign this.  It means, you know, you're betting on the fact that our marriage won't last.  Yeah, so we don't marry her.  No, who didn't sign a prenup?  Paul McCartney's wife there.  Really?  Paul McCartney didn't believe in it.  God, I hope she gets half some day.  Oh, my.  What an idiot. 
[00:56:30]  Cut the shoe budget in half, though, because she files that in the papers.  What's she asking for all the money for the shoes?  She only needs wound.  She only needs wound.  The shoe budget.  The shoe budget.  Why so much for the pedicure?  It's 50% off.  She's only got five bleeding toes. 
[00:57:00]  Cheryl.  Hi, guys.  Call me now.  Cheryl.  Guys, I just want to give you something.  Big up.  You know, when I first came to this country, right, a few friends of mine, they told me  that this is a woman's country.  So I said, I'm going to ask them to explain what.  You know, what does that really mean?  Because being from the Caribbean and all of that, she explained to me all of this stuff  and it was like, it was, it was, it was, it was mind boggling to me because in the Caribbean 
[00:57:30]  where we're from, it's like, these things don't happen.  You get married, you get, you get divorced.  One goes east and one goes west and that is it.  That's true, right?  Yeah.  One goes east and one goes west.  Well, if the man, um, doesn't want to look after his kids, you can take him to, take him  to family court, but to go into court and ask some money for dogs.  Yeah.  You don't even hear that in the Caribbean.  Believe me, guys, these things don't happen in the Caribbean. 
[00:58:00]  It's like, come in here.  I'm like, this is crazy.  It's like, uh, you won lotto if you're a woman from another country and you come here,  right?  Exactly.  No, I know why they said that, um, this is the line of opportunity because I mean,  come on, you know, girls don't get this kind of treatment in the Caribbean.  Yeah.  Yep.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  Very good, Cheryl.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  All right.  I love child support laws because you have no say, like women want to be pro-choice, you 
[00:58:30]  have no say in whether or not she has a baby.  It doesn't matter what you want.  But yet, if, you know, you've got to pay for it.  I'm not even going to get into that one because, uh, you know, kids are another story.  I know nothing about that.  I'm just talking about guy, girl, married, love, no love anymore.  And for some reason, the guy's got to leave the house.  The guy gets screwed.  He's paying money.  That's why finishing on the face is the way to go.  Jesus.  Lisa.  Do you love me? 
[00:59:00]  You bet I do.  Hello?  Here's a girl that, um, got, uh, screwed in a divorce.  What's up, Lisa?  How you doing?  All right.  I love you guys.  I'm in Washington, D.C., originally from Brooklyn.  I've tried to get through to you guys so many times.  I think you're great.  Thank you.  We love you out here.  You've got to spread the word of the show down there in D.C.  Absolutely.  I'm trying.  And actually, I finally saw a couple people with some wow stickers, and I was impressed  the other day.  Now, I'm not going to go flashing.  I'm a 40-year-old single parent, but I was impressed to see them.  That's all right.  A little secret.  That's one of my turn-ons. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Okay.  She likes the decrepit girls.  I just love you guys.  No, I mean, I'm not trying to put down anybody.  I'm just saying women get a bad rap, too, because I'm, uh, divorced from a self-employed  guy who loves to hide all his money and gives me pretty much absolutely nothing and, uh, just  got screwed all along.  Never sees his kids, never does anything.  So there's a lot of women out there that get the same rap the, uh, guys do.  And I know a lot of good fathers out there that got really screwed also. 
[01:00:00]  So I think it just goes all the way around.  No, you know what it is, though?  See, now you're talking stuff that is technically illegal, you know?  Right.  But what do you do to prove it?  But I'm just talking about people that are thrown at the mercy of the courts.  No, this is true.  They're not trying to screw.  Like, I never tried doing anything illegal.  People approached me all the time.  Right.  During my case saying, oh, you know, I could do this for you.  You could do this, yeah.  Hey, why don't we do this?  I'm like, no, you know what?  And me, naive, I'm like, no, I'm going to see this. 
[01:00:30]  But still, justice will prevail.  We'll look at the situation.  No way.  Where we came from, what we did, this, that, and we'll see what happens.  And you know something?  No, you're right.  There's no, the court is really slanted.  Well, I love what you guys said about the $80,000 a month.  Who the heck spends $80,000 if I ever?  How does her lawyer go into court with a straight face and throw out a figure like $80,000 a month?  Obviously, that's just under a million for a year.  I mean, I don't even get the amount that they're asking for the dog. 
[01:01:00]  And she makes her own money, too.  She makes her own money, too.  Let justice be done with a heaven's fall.  I'm working 55 hours a week, can't afford to pay for my two kids.  And you got this guy.  I mean, what did you say, $1,140 for a dog?  I don't even get that much for two kids and a dog.  It's amazing.  But, no, I just wanted to say, you know, I know a lot of guys that have gotten screwed, a lot of women.  It's just the laws out there are just disgusting.  I mean, it doesn't, no one has any protection from anything.  And it's just, you know, how good your lawyer is is what, you know, what you can and cannot get away with. 
[01:01:30]  But also on, like you said, how fair you want to be and how far you want to push it also.  Yeah, that's it.  It's amazing.  But I do love you guys.  And I will spread the word.  Thank you, Lisa.  You guys are awesome.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye.  I'm sure Donna Hanover is a great actress.  I'm sure that career is ready to take off.  She was in Turk 182.  Well.  Played herself.  Everybody wants a 50-something-year-old ex-mayor's wife in their newest film.  Is she going to be an action hero?  Mike, what's up? 
[01:02:00]  How are you guys?  She took me to court, but she didn't have a leg to stand on.  Hey, Mike.  Now, I heard Paul McCartney talking about this recently.  And when you actually think about it, he makes a lot of sense.  Now, he said that when you're married to someone for a very long time, let's just say, and your marriage was wonderful, this woman was wonderful, she did everything right, and you couldn't ask for a better wife.  And then, God forbid, that marriage ends. 
[01:02:30]  Either she dies or you get divorced, whatever.  Or the best thing that you can do is to get remarried because, like, most guys, 9 out of 10 guys will tell you they would never, ever get remarried.  Because they were miserable.  All over the world.  You know?  Yeah.  Paul McCartney had such a wonderful marriage with Linda that the biggest tribute that you could pay to her, like, respect to her, is to get remarried saying she did such a wonderful job, and he wants that again. 
[01:03:00]  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  That car was swerving, man.  From guardrail to guardrail.  How about this?  When you have a good marriage and your spouse dies, it's respectful to get remarried because that shows how great things were to begin with.  Boy, that would have been quick.  Yeah.  Quick and easy.  But, you know, when Paul met her, and he's noticed she didn't have a leg, he went to take her foot, but it was prosthetic, so she didn't laugh. 
[01:03:30]  So he didn't think he was doing very well.  Could she coo?  All right.  Plastic, you ass.  Could she coo?  She's not laughing.  I don't understand.  Paul, try tickling her foot.  Hey, Ringo, come here.  Tickle her foot.  She's not even giggling. 
[01:04:00]  George, tickle her foot with your head bump.  What's wrong with you, man?  Too bad I do a cart in a jersey action.  Mike Trasham.  All right.  Why don't we break?  We're going to get some fun back into the show today.  Hey, I'm having fun.  No, it's good.  But Lady Di is coming in today?  Yeah, a lot of people right now, listen.  They're going, oh, they're going, oh, her.  No, this is going to be fun.  We said we had one more thing to do with Lady Di before we decide if she stays or goes. 
[01:04:30]  I don't understand why we didn't pick up on the fact that she's a complete blithering idiot before this.  But today we'll show how stupid she is.  How are you?  She's going to take a little exam today for us.  A little exam.  Colon rectal.  A little exam that the average person passed in sixth grade.  The Lady Di's exam is on the way, Anthony. 
[01:05:00]  We were messing around in the back office today, and we came across something we forgot all about.  Oh, yeah.  And we want to play this for you right now.  An old friend of the radio show.  You might become a new friend again.  You never know.  Yeah.  Because it's always out the old, in with the new.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  We lost Stark and Patty.  We gained Tippy Tom.  That's nice.  That's a nice trade right there.  A little balance.  We lose Lady Di possibly.  Do we bring back Wheelchair Fred?  Wheelchair Fred.  Do we bring him back, Anthony? 
[01:05:30]  I think yes.  We had a lot of fun with Wheelchair Fred when we were up in Boston.  He did a little prank call for us.  Check this out as he calls information.  Should we perhaps describe him a little bit?  We did, because you tried to make him walk.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the same guy that I tried to make walk.  He got into a motorcycle accident, and he wasn't able to talk.  He sounds like a retard when he talks.  But he's got his wits about him.  But he just sounds like a retard, and we had him make a phone call. 
[01:06:00]  To information, you want to look up Anita Bushlicker.  Anita Bushlicker.  Mrs. Bushlicker.  Right.  In Lemonster.  Lemonster.  As we get local for mass today.  Check this out.

[01:08:30]  Is that the first name or is that the street?  That's the street is her name also.  Why do you think she moved there?  Okay.  With B-U-S-H, I don't have anything in Lemistore, resident area for an Antigua or on Antigua Street.  Bushlicker.  Bushlicker.  B-U-S-H, I don't have a listing for you.  Let me store the resident area.  Sorry.  You could find this.  So could you please look a fire beaver?  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show on the Friday edition. 
[01:09:00]  We got a girl here in New York City. 
[01:09:30]  She's going to be the latest contestant in the WOW contest, Anthony.  An old friend.  Yeah.  Do you remember Candy?  Candy.  Candy.  Candy.  Helping us out.  What's up with Lily?  Lily from Philly.  Contestant 25 with black under her eyes.  She's doing a baseball thing. 
[01:10:00]  Is that what she's doing?  A sports thing.  There you go.  Is it painted on or does she just not listen?  It's painted on.  Very good.  There you go.  That's all right.  I like when they get almost completely naked in these pictures.  Very good.  And real fast, we were discussing this earlier, Dallas coming to the table in this contest.  Un-effing-believe.  Go to opanthony.com to check out all the contestants, especially the ones coming out of Dallas so far. 
[01:10:30]  Dallas getting some pros.  We'll be qualifying all next week and beyond, I believe.  So, J. Lou from Boston, contestant number 29, Sabrina's boobs look like the lazy eyes of the late, great Sammy Davis Jr.  Yes.  Tamara.  Hi.  What's up, Tamara?  Hey.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  How old are you, Tamara?  Hold on.  How old are you?  Huh?  How old are you?  Fourteen. 
[01:11:00]  Okay.  What's going on today?  Okay.  I heard this show, like, yesterday night, and before, like, the week before, I was looking through my dad's house, and, yeah, and I was looking through his bed thing, and I looked in the drawer, and there were, like, Playboys and Bondage magazines and, like, all this crap.  It was so disgusting.  Oh, my God.  Bondage magazines, huh?  Yeah.  It was just wrong.  This stupid bit we did the other day has taken on a life of its own. 
[01:11:30]  And I got to tell you, I think more people have done it off the air than on the air.  Like, we kind of gave people ideas, and now, like, Tamara, she's been snooping, have you?  We've heard from a lot of parents that are trying to hide their stuff better.  Hide it a little better?  It was so easy when you could just put it in the night table next to the bed or the closet in the bedroom, but now the kids are looking.  You find anything else?  No, but there's, like, piles and piles of it.  And, like, in the bathroom drawer, there was this condom that expired in, like, 1995. 
[01:12:00]  It was just, ew.  Throw that out unless you want a little sibling.  Do your parents seem happy?  Hello?  Yeah.  Do they seem happy?  Huh?  I think she said she went to her dad's.  Oh, are your parents still together?  No, they're divorced.  Oh, okay.  So you stayed with your dad and kind of snooped around his apartment?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Tamara.  Okay, you're welcome.  All right.  Bye.  We've got another kid calling. 
[01:12:30]  Sean.  Hey, Sean.  Hello?  What's up, Sean?  Uh, nothing.  How old are you?  15.  That's funny.  Don't make fun of me.  All right.  I've got a problem.  Sorry.  What's your problem?  No, I've got a problem when I laugh a lot.  Oh.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Yeah.  No, no, yeah, but I sound like babies and butthead.  Yeah.  Do you laugh sometimes when you're not supposed to?  Yeah, I get nervous.  That's good news is you can never be executed in this country.  You're a blithering idiot.  Oh, yeah, we can't execute the retards anymore. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Hey, that's not funny.  Everybody thinks I'm gay, though.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't act gay, but everybody thinks I'm gay because I'm all the girl's friends.  Huh.  Well, are you gay?  Are you?  No.  Don't say that.  We got to dump out of you.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  Don't say it.  We know what you're going to say.  You don't even have to say it.  Yeah, I basically said you don't do that.  He goes, I don't smoke the sea.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  And then, like, I, like, was hanging out on these forums one day, or yesterday.  Uh-huh.  And, like, they, like, I was talking about something, and they all said I was gay. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  And everybody thinks I'm gay, and all my friends.  All right.  Sorry, sorry.  You have a potty mouth, Sean.  Yeah, Sean, you can't say that.  Yeah, don't care.  You fish on the other side of the pond is what they're saying.  Yeah.  Okay.  So why are you calling us today, Sean?  I was going to go through my dad's door.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Have you done this before?  Uh, yeah. 
[01:14:00]  And so we're going to find some good stuff?  Yeah.  All right.  You found good stuff in your dad's drawers before?  Yeah.  All right, Sean, uh, if you would, are your parents still together?  No.  Oh, they're divorced, too.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, uh, what did you find?  Well, I found a Dildo with no batteries in it, because I took them out for my Game Boy.  You found a what?  A Dildo with no batteries in it, because I took them out for my Game Boy.  All right.  You took them out for your Game Boy. 
[01:14:30]  And I don't think your dad's ever going to question it.  No.  I don't think he's going to come to you and go, where do my batteries go?  And then I found, uh, condoms.  Yeah.  What kind?  And then I found Victoria's Secret.  Hold on.  What kind of condoms?  What, uh, Trojan Extra Pleasure or something like that.  Then I found Prozac.  You found Prozac?  A little bit of Prozac?  Yeah.  So your dad's a little bit, uh, depressed or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And some, uh, Victoria's Secret calendars or something? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Does he have a lot of chicks come over?  Uh, no.  Not really.  No?  No.  So what's he need the, uh, the dill for?  I don't know.  Maybe everybody thinks he's good, too.  Oh, no.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.  Hey, can you turn on your father's dill for us?  I don't have, I don't want to take the batteries out of my Game Boy.  Well, you can.  Come on.  No.  It'll be a team player.  It'll be kind of funny to hear your dad's dill.  Ha, ha.  It's like, I'm not sure if it's like a regular build-out. 
[01:15:30]  It's like, not like, it's like shaped like, you know, a hool-a-dilly.  It's shaped like a guy's thing?  Yeah, but it's not like the mushroom thing or anything.  It's just kind of like a stick.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  It's just kind of a stick.  It's kind of like a vibrator stick.  Yeah.  That seems like he's working his way into a certain lifestyle.  Yeah, perhaps.  Slowly.  All right.  Slowly working his way into a certain lifestyle.  Yeah, he's not a major leaguer yet. 
[01:16:00]  He's still playing in the minors.  Doesn't want to make the mushroom commitment yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Playing without a helmet for now.  Come on.  All right, Sean, anything else?  Hello?  Sean?  No.  Anything else?  No.  No.  That was it, huh?  All right, man.  All right.  All right, thank you for that, Sean.  Bye.  God, that is just funny, man.  The whole, the voice is what makes it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They took the batteries out of my Game Boy.  He's got a dill.  He's got a dill.  But it doesn't have a mushroom. 
[01:16:30]  It's like a stick, a vibrating stick.  Tom.  Yeah.  What's up, Tom?  Um, I wanted to tell you guys about something that happened to me with my two little boys.  Okay.  We have a six-year-old and a three-year-old, and my wife was working, and I was at work.  Actually, we had a babysitter.  Um, we came home, and, uh, my, my six-year-old had gone through my drawer, and I bought a  bunch of condoms, uh, wholesale off a website.  Bought, like, a package of a hundred.  Yeah.  And, uh, him and the three-year-old had hidden them through the house. 
[01:17:00]  And, uh, I had started with a hundred.  I think I got down to, like, eighty.  And, uh, my wife and I have found forty of them so far.  We don't know, we have no idea where the rest of them are.  Oh, that's classic.  They just hid them throughout the house, like little Easter eggs.  They hid them, they play cards with them, they play, like, money games with them.  They think it's money.  And then, we found some clogged up in the toilet.  As long as they don't think it's chewing gum.  Have they been opening them?  Uh, I don't know.  I haven't found any of them open.  I found a lot of these little blue packages all over the damn house.  Look, Daddy, a balloon. 
[01:17:30]  So, we've looked under the couch.  We found a few under the couch.  We found a few behind the TV.  A few behind the bar.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, it's, it's just been hell looking for these damn condoms.  That'll make for a great embarrassing story when they get older.  Yeah, really.  All right, Tom.  Hey, Norton.  Not gonna work, sir.  He didn't even want to hear that it wasn't gonna work.  Yeah, please.  Forced it on you.  If a six-year-old and a three-year-old get over on him, don't try to keep me to go, what?  And, should we take it to the next level today?  Yeah, we were talking about this.  As we wait for Lady Di to show up for her little exam. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, this might be, uh, even more interesting than what is in the parents' night tables.  Or secret little areas of their, uh, bedrooms.  We're gonna take it a step further.  Kids, look for matches.  No, no, no.  We, um.  We're talking, we're talking right now to the little brothers out there.  Little brothers out there.  Looking for the little brothers in our listening audience.  And, um, we're talking of little brothers of sisters. 
[01:18:30]  Little brothers that have older sisters.  So if you're a guy in the house and you got a sister, and your older sister is at band practice or something,  she's got her own bedroom in the house, you know what I mean.  Your sister's bedroom.  But she's not there right now.  You do, you, yeah.  All this has to fit.  You need a sister.  You need, uh, uh, her not to be home.  She has to have her bedroom.  And, uh, call us up.  Because we want, we want you to poke around in there for a little bit. 
[01:19:00]  Tell us what you find.  Oh, look at that.  Kenny already on the phone.  All right.  Wow, that's, that's pretty good.  Hey, I'm gonna be hanging up on a lot of people.  Don't take it, uh, personally, okay?  Bye, Nick.  Bye, Roger.  Bye, Tony.  And, bye, John.  We gotta free some lines, okay?  Yeah.  People get pissed off.  We just start hanging up on people, but we have to.  We have to make room to get other people calling in. 
[01:19:30]  Hey, Kenny.  What's up, Kenny?  Yo.  Hey.  Um, I want to tell you what I found in my sister's closet.  Well, how old are you?  I'm 17.  You're 17.  How old's your sister?  22.  And where's she right now?  She is, uh, I don't know where she right now.  Okay.  Um, well, I found, uh, a huge box of condoms, like one of those 30-pack ones.  And, uh.  Wait, where'd you find that?  It was in her closet.  Okay.  And I found, uh, dildo.  Well, all right.  We like to call them dills. 
[01:20:00]  Dills.  We're, we're able to use the other word.  I know, but just in case we get into more detail later.  It's just kind of fun to hear the little kids say dill.  Dill.  I found a dill.  I found a dill.  How about a little kid?  And it was, I know.  And it was curved for, curved for her pleasure?  For her pleasure.  Oh, and, uh, one more thing?  Yeah.  Uh, just for what I found in my parents' room.  Yeah.  In my dad's, I found about, uh, 20 empty dime bags.  Really?  Yeah.  Does your father deal in the pot?  Oh, no.  He doesn't deal, but. 
[01:20:30]  He just buys them and saves the baggies?  Yeah, then I steal the roaches.  I learned it from you, okay?  I learned it from you.  He's got to get high.  He knows his daughter is banging next door with condoms in her car.  Oh.  Trying to forget.  All right, Kenny, thank you.  You're welcome.  All right, the phones have exploded, and I think we can get a quick break in here.  Before we do, we've got to go to Earl.  Earl finally made it to the racetrack.  Earl.  Earl.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  What happened to your energy from earlier?  Uh, it got completely defeated in the van. 
[01:21:00]  More bad phones from Earl.  Um, Earl.  I'm standing in the middle with just completely surrounded by trees, and there's a band playing.  I can put, uh, sorry.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Yes.  This is so fun.  This is just like the old days.  Earl, we have a really good show today.  Earl.  Yes.  Oh, your phone's working again?  I had to move around a little bit.  Now, Earl, did you place my bet?  We just got here.  The fifth race started. 
[01:21:30]  Son of a bitch.  Who won the fourth?  Um, I believe your two horses finished last and next to last, respectively.  Really?  I believe so, but I'll double tag.  All right.  That's what I was told, but we're here at, uh, Belmont.  We're right by the, uh, we're right by Sunset Park, and we'll be here until 7 p.m.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you.  All right.  There you go, Earl.  I know.  Sounds like a regular party going on there.  Woo-hoo!  Rachel, what's up?  Hey, O&A?  Hey. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, I'm 17.  My 13-year-old's brother's at home.  If he's going through my stuff right now, I'm going to kill you guys.  What's your brother's name?  What is he going to find?  What?  What is he going to find?  That's not for you guys, no, but...  We don't know who you are.  So?  You're freaked, aren't you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to kill you guys.  You better not do bits like this.  Do you have anything in your drawer shaped like the Washington Monument?  Maybe.  Are you willing to make the mushroom commitment? 
[01:22:30]  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, she's not happy.  People don't like this bit.  Keep Jeremy on the line over there.  That seems good.  Yeah, we'll go to the phones next.  They're calling like crazy.  But first, the Tippy Tom alcohol service, Anthony.  Lady Di on the way to take her little exam, and then we'll finally decide what the hell to do with her.  Okay?  Right.  But one of the new additions to our show, Tippy Tom.  If you want my father, and you think I'm sexy, come on, baby, nothing to me, no.  Lonely? 
[01:23:00]  You're saying it right.  Looking for the time of your life?  Are you single?  Hygiene, not an issue?  Hepatitis C, which I've had 20 years.  Sit back, lube up, and dial Tippy Tom.  I'm a slut.  He's homeless, smells like a dumpster, and he's horny.  Can you lick my b*****g?  For a model of Thunderbird, he's all yours.  I'm a human being.  I want a b*****g.  Guys.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot when I was two years old. 
[01:23:30]  Girls.  I have girlfriends, too.  He's so drunk, he doesn't care.  All right, who's next?  Just name the place, and he'll be there.  Around behind a dumpster or something like that.  Call 1-900-SYPHILIS for the ride of your life.  I know how to shake my bed.  Not responsible for any diseases contracted as a result of sex with Biffy Tom.  You're saying right.  We're back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Ready, steady, go.  All open, folks. 
[01:24:00]  All right, the phones have exploded.  Once again, Anthony.  We've got little brothers standing by.  Their older sisters are out.  Yep.  We're taking the bit we did two days ago to the next level, right?  Well, we had kids looking through their parents' night tables for anything incriminating.  And today, we figured, what the hell, let's get the little brothers in the sisters' room  and see what sis is up to. 
[01:24:30]  Sexy sis.  So we've got some little brothers standing by right now.  Let's say hi to Paul.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, ONA.  How old are you, Paul?  I'm 16.  How old is your sister?  She's 20.  And where is she right now?  She's going down to the Wildwood for the weekend.  Oh, very nice.  Wow, nice.  With a boyfriend?  No, one of her friends.  Oh, they're going to pick guys up?  Probably.  I don't know.  Was it easy to get in her room?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because, like, it's summer vacation now.  Everyone's pretty much gone.  Okay.  Like four.  What kind of girl is your sister? 
[01:25:00]  Is she, I don't know, a prude, slutty?  What is she?  What would you consider?  She's not really slutty.  You know, she hangs out.  She has a lot of guy friends.  She doesn't do anything, really.  Oh, really?  Nah.  Is she in college or anything?  Yeah.  Is she hot?  Well, yeah.  All my friends are, like, strolling over.  Really?  Yeah.  You got any naked pictures of her?  No.  What kind of posters does she have up in her room?  Willa Ford, Dave Matthews. 
[01:25:30]  I try to get her to listen to you guys.  Nah.  Nah.  No hope there, right?  Nah.  That's what makes this bit good.  Yeah.  She's not listening.  That's why it works.  All right, so you're snooping around in her room right now?  Yeah.  Well, I did it this morning.  She has a bunch of Maxim magazines, and I was looking through them, and she has this one  magazine called Black Inches.  Wait a minute.  It's called Black Inches?  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  I saw it.  I couldn't believe it.  I was like, all right, all right, please tell me this is, like, a rap magazine.  She likes rap.  I was like, please.  So I looked through it, and it must be old, because it says, ring in year 98 with Black C.  Oh, my God.  She likes looking at pictures of Black Man C's?  I would have never imagined.  Does she hang out with Black dudes?  I would not.  Well, I mean, her best friend's a girl.  She's Black.  I mean, she doesn't really hang out with a lot of Black guys, no.  Wow.  I guess she wants to.  I guess she wants to, though. 
[01:26:30]  That's kind of exciting.  Did you find anything else with white guys in it?  No.  That's the only thing.  Oh, she's totally...  You might want to show that to Dad immediately.  Is your dad?  I'm serious.  He would go crazy.  Dude, where's your father right now?  He's at work.  Should we call him?  No.  No.  You've got to give us his phone number.  I want to call him and tell him that his daughter has Black Inches magazine on it.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Is he like, you know, the Daddy's Little Girl type Daddy? 
[01:27:00]  Well, yeah, but he's very strict.  Yeah?  By strict, you mean extremely racist.  Yeah.  Me and him go at it, like, all the time.  Yeah?  Arguing.  What would he say if he knew your daughter had Black Inches magazine in the room?  Oh, man.  I don't know.  Hopefully not.  I was wondering where that went.  All right, Norton.  That's the line.  The line of the day.  Nice. 
[01:27:30]  All right, Paul.  Well, thank you for that.  All right.  See you guys.  Norton, you rule.  All right.  Yes, he does.  There goes Paul.  Oh, God.  How old.  I'm assuming that's all he found in his sister's room there.  Let's move on to Joey, 16 years old.  What's up, Joey?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  How old is your sister?  She's 20.  20.  Where is she right now?  Another 20-year-old.  Uh, she's in school.  Uh, she's in school.  All right.  Uh, summer school?  No.  Well, she's taking courses all the time.  She's a professional student.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is she hot?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:28:00]  She's kind of hot.  Guys like her.  She gets a lot of action, according to these Polaroids here.  Stop it.  Well, she's got some Polaroids in her drawer.  Mostly solo stuff.  Her, her boyfriend.  You're looking at naked pictures of your 20-year-old sister?  Well, you guys wanted me to go through the drawer, and I just found them.  I don't know if we should believe you.  What is she doing in these pictures?  Um, self-pleasure.  Can I say that?  You can say that, all right. 
[01:28:30]  Okay.  And who's taking the pictures, you think?  Uh, I guess her boyfriend.  And where'd you find these pictures?  In her nightstand drawer.  Isn't that a little risky?  Well, nobody's home.  I mean, isn't it a little risky for her to have them there?  I guess so.  Leave one under your dad's pillow.  No, I don't know.  Yeah, we're not buying it, Joey.  Yeah, I'm not really, you know.  What, what, what, what do you want to know?  Again, I want to believe.  There's plenty of, uh, little brothers that are going to do this for real. 
[01:29:00]  We don't need you guys faking it on it.  Yeah.  No, these are, I got the Polaroids right in my hand.  Nah, I think that's, uh, this is more like you want to just be a part of the thing and  you're a good lad, but.  Yeah.  No, no, Jim, don't say that.  No, no, I understand.  You just want to be part of the team.  The Munchausen syndrome, or however you say it.  Okay, well, what can I do to convince you guys?  I mean, I got a handful of Polaroids right here.  I got, you can, you can immediately put them on your computer and send them here.  Oh, there you go.  Scan them in and send them to, uh, I don't have a scanner.  All right, hold on a second. 
[01:29:30]  Let's go to Jeremy.  All right.  I'm not buying that guy.  Jeremy, is he looking through Ken's desk?  Jeremy.  Hey, Jeremy.  Hey, all right.  What's up?  You're six, uh, how old are you?  I'm 14.  Oh, 14.  And your sister's 16?  Yeah.  And where's she right now?  Uh, she's playing tennis.  She's playing tennis.  Okay.  Are you in her room?  Yeah, I'm in her room right now.  All right.  Now, what's on the walls?  All right.  On the walls, we got a Backstreet Boys poster.  Oh, boy.  We got an NSYNC poster.  Oh, boy.  And that's it. 
[01:30:00]  That's it?  Yeah, that's on the wall.  What kind of, uh, bedspread or any stuffed animals or?  Yeah, we got a, uh, little Met stuffed, uh, bear.  Okay.  It's white.  We have a little tiger.  All right.  Actually, two tigers.  All right.  And, you know, like a hundred of them.  They're like little dogs.  Does she have a little dresser with a mirror on it?  Uh, yes.  She actually has two of those.  And what kind of stuff is in front of there, makeup-wise?  All right.  We got this little, like, uh, brown oak chest.  Yeah.  It has makeup in it.  Yeah.  Uh, she's got, like, all these little candles. 
[01:30:30]  Candles.  Good.  Does she have a Susie Bake Oven, too?  How old is this retard?  16.  All right.  Are you snooping?  It's an easy bake oven, you tool.  Susie Bake Oven.  Yeah, I'm nervous.  Oh, you suck.  That's Susie Bake Oven.  It's a clam.  Well, you know what?  I'm glad I didn't know that.  Good.  I'm glad.  All right.  Jeremy, have you found anything yet?  Uh, yeah, I got, um, I got a dill right here.  A dill, sorry.  You have a dill?  Wait a minute. 
[01:31:00]  Your sister has a dill?  Yeah.  What does it look like?  Uh, it's about, I'd say about eight inches.  It's, uh, black, and on the top, you know, where the sea would meet the ambag, it says, Black Widow.  It's called the Black Widow?  Yeah.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  And where was that hidden?  Uh, that's under her CDs, with her draw.  Under her CDs?  She's all backstreet boys and sing.  Wow.  That's something.  That's the motherlone. 
[01:31:30]  If you look to the right of the dill, there's a little disco light.  Uh-huh.  Some tampons.  Uh-huh.  And there's some more Justin Timberlake pictures.  Justin Timberlake pictures?  So she probably uses that and the Justin Timberlake.  Any, any pornography?  She's petting the poodle to Justin.  Yeah.  Not that I see.  You know, just, uh, just, uh, pictures of Justin's house.  Is there a hammer or a mallet next to the dill?  Yeah, there should be one on your head, Norton.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  Very good comeback.  Very good, Jeremy.  Take it easy with those zingers. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Jeremy, thank you, unless you have any, uh, something else there.  No, that's about it.  Hey, did you lift up her mattress?  Uh, yeah, I'll do that right now.  Lift up that mattress.  See if there's anything under there.  Let's see here.  Oh, there's a little diary here.  Should I pull that out?  Pull that out.  Pull the diary out!  All right, uh, just, looks like there's only, like, one entry in there.  She didn't use it much.  It's from, uh, 1997.  So she was, like, uh, 11 then.  All right, what does it say? 
[01:32:30]  All right, it, uh, just says on the top, it says, do your diary.  And then it goes on to say, like, it's long.  You want me to read the whole thing?  Yeah, let me give it a little bit.  Yeah, let me give it a little bit.  Let's start it out there.  All right, it says, uh, today Jerry came over to my house.  We were studying for the math test, and you know what's going to happen at this point.  What?  Norton, go in.  No way.  What?  No, no, go ahead, read it.  All right, so it says, he lied.  Yeah, he was lying.  You didn't know that? 
[01:33:00]  When he said, I found a diary, here's what told me he was lying.  It was too quick, yeah.  A, he knew it was a diary immediately, and B, he said, from 1997 when she was 11, he immediately  made that math thing, that subtraction.  And not only that, but it was like, it's a diary, there's just one entry.  It's like, well, you've got to open it up.  So he lied about the black widow.  Don't lie just to fit in, guys.  Call up with the truth.  Teresa, what's going on?  My little brother is addicted to you guys, 13 years old, since he found out what wow meant  on a car.  I was the idiot to tell him that it meant to whip him out Wednesday, so now every Wednesday 
[01:33:30]  he's looking for his boobs hanging out.  Yeah.  He's spending the week at my house with my boyfriend, and I'm sure he's there rumbling through everything  because my boyfriend doesn't care what he's doing.  Listen, this is what you guys are corrupting, 13-year-olds.  All he does is stare at boobs all day long.  That's all he wants.  Hey, look, if B's putting on a trench coat and shooting his classmates.  Well, there you go.  True, true, true.  He's a pervert.  Jim Norton, he thinks the rules.  O.B. and Anthony, all he does is make that disgusted sound you make.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All he does.  You guys are his idol. 
[01:34:00]  I'm like, it cracks me up.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Tony.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  The commercial said, call for Jim Norton tickets.  We've been trying.  We want to go to see him.  What's the thing?  Jim Norton rules.  Every comedy club, we go and see him all the time.  Where do you want to see me?  I'm not being a plug for you.  Is it Westbury in September?  What?  Good Marina.  We want to see him.  Oh, that's July 27th.  Hold on the line.  We'll give you a pair of tickets.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  Hold on.  Thank you.  I didn't know we were giving out tickets there.  Hey, Laura, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  About a year ago, me and my boyfriend's brother were cleaning out his brother's room, and  we're looking in the drawers, and there's, like, a stack of letters.  We're like, oh, yeah, we've got to open these.  His girlfriend, while he was at Christ Boy Camp, he went to this, like, Christian camp.  Christ Boy Camp?  Yeah.  It's like a Christian camp.  Oh, Jesus.  Imagine what goes on there.  Did he duck walk a lot?  What?  Nothing.  So, we're going through the letters, and there's, like, all these, like, nasty pictures of, 
[01:35:00]  like, just her booth and, you know, other places.  Right.  But the worst part is that she had this huge scar down her chest.  It was, like, disgusting.  And me and his brother were just, like, oh, my God, like, reading these letters and stuff  was, like, really doing well.  So, my boyfriend comes running upstairs, so we hid them.  That's that S-word.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Wait, who was the lady with the scar?  Was that the chick that's talking now? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.  Yeah.  Okay, okay.  And she's with the brother now, keeping secrets from your boyfriend?  No, no, no.  Oh, boy.  It's kind of weird, but the pictures were funny, and, like, it was just great.  And he still doesn't know that we found them.  Little secrets with the brother.  Yeah.  Pretty funny.  You ever have sex with the brother?  No.  Okay.  It was cool.  It was a scar on the breast? 
[01:36:00]  It was, like, right down her rib cage.  It was really weird.  Wow.  How long can we have surgery?  All right.  Thank you, Laura.  Yeah, no problem.  There's nothing there, either.  What the hell's going on?  You're killing us here.  John, what's going on?  Hey, this is John.  I'm about to go to my sister's room.  Is that all right?  Are you going to fake it?  Hell no.  Everyone's been faking it, John.  No faking.  Sorry, I'm not going to fake it.  We don't need to fake.  John, you're 14 years old?  Yes.  And your sister's 22?  Yes.  Okay.  And where is she right now?  She's at work. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  All right.  What's on her walls and stuff?  Blue.  What?  Blue.  It's just blue walls.  Oh, paint?  Yeah.  But is there posters or anything?  No.  No, huh?  Well, um, but while I was on hold, I found this thing.  It's Hask Placenta.  What?  Hask Placenta.  Nature's most complete conditioning treatment.  Oh, it's a hair conditioner or stuff.  It's made of placenta extract derived from animal placenta.  Yeah, they do that.  Yeah, you rinse your old hair out with it.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Well, anyway, I'm going to start looking through underneath your bed right now.  All right.  Let's see.  Snoop around a little.  Okay.  I found a bra.  All right.  And, uh, fix yourself a boyfriend.  Anything else?  No.  All right.  I'm going to go look in her nightstand.  I can't really find anything right now.  All right.  Nightstand.  Antidepressants.  Get out of here.  I found...  I don't even hear anything open or... 
[01:37:30]  I seriously found a bottle of antidepressants.  I swear to God.  Shake them.  All right.  What kind?  All right.  I think this guy's legit.  All right.  What's the name on it?  It just says Rite Aid.  No, you idiot.  No.  What's the name of the drug?  That's funny.  You don't know what the drug is?  No.  It's a little orange bottle.  It says Rite Aid on it.  Okay.  And on the side, it says antidepressants.  Take one per day.  What do the pills look like?  They're round and white. 
[01:38:00]  Round and white.  I don't know.  Okay.  All right.  Now I'm going to go look in her jars.  Her what?  Her jars?  Drawers.  Oh, drawers.  Open them.  You put the...  I know.  No, I speak English.  It was just your awful accent.  The drawers.  You don't have to sound out every word.  Every...  Ah!  Syllable.  Open it up.  All right.  Let's see.  Socks.  I found the money.  I'll take this.  Uh-huh.  Huh?  I found four condoms. 
[01:38:30]  Oh.  You're what kind?  They're chosen extended pleasure.  Extended pleasure.  And they're small.  They're small?  Yes.  It says size small.  She's dating an Asian fella?  I don't know.  Anything else there, John?  Yes, sir.  Hold on.  Let me check.  Okay.  Okay.  This guy is at least really doing it.  He's looking around.  Anything else? 
[01:39:00]  Ah, no.  Hmm.  Apparently I can't find anything.  Let me look underneath our bed.  You looked there, you idiot.  Under her mattress.  Look under her mattress.  Darn it.  She's so boring.  There's nothing under here.  All right.  All right.  It happens, though.  At least you're really doing it.  Yeah.  Let's see any other books.  I looked up here a few days ago,  and I found three books on different sex positions.  I found massage for lovers.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Simple, sensuous techniques for enhancing sexual pleasure.  The new joy of sex, a complete gourmet guide to lovemaking for the 90s.  90s?  And the ultimate, a therapist guide to sexual fulfillment.  Wow.  How old is she?  She's 22.  22.  Yeah, she's rocking.  You know what?  Perfect Diction, she really sounds like she's a good bank.  Yeah, she's into it.  All right, well.  Is she hot?  I wouldn't say so, but everyone else does. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  See you.  Bye.  Me and my brother, when we were moving,  you know, my mother and sister and me and my brother moving out of one house into another,  and I don't know, I think my sister was,  how could she have been?  14, something like that?  We're moving her dresser out, and the top drawer slides open.  There's condoms right there.  We're just like, oh.  Oh, no.  Like, oh, Dawn's a slut.  Just like, oh, good condoms there. 
[01:40:30]  And she's going out at the time with this little wormy, bookwormy guy at school.  This little wormy kid who, like, just came across as a Star Trek geek.  So you think that kid was getting some?  Yeah.  Oh, apparently they were pounding each other.  Oh, no.  There's a lot of condoms in it.  It was just like, oh, Dawn's banging.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, we're going to try one more of these.  Hey, Tom.  Hey.  What's going on?  You're 15 years old?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Your sister's 18?  Yeah.  She's at the beach?  She's at the beach.  You're in her room?  Yeah, I'm in her room.  Seriously, dude, if you're faking this with the radio, just hang up right now.  No, I'm not.  Because we don't need it.  Describe the room a little bit.  Okay.  It's pretty small.  It's got, like, a Mean People Suck poster and a Calvin Klein poster.  That's about it.  Okay.  That's it.  It's unpainted, too.  All right.  So start...  I found a 1980s CD player.  It's like the size of a VCR. 
[01:41:30]  Okay.  It's huge.  Yeah.  And, okay, I was already looking through it.  I found a fake idea.  That's about it.  That's about it?  Fake idea.  Yeah.  So you don't have any fun stuff?  Well, that's good enough fake idea.  That stinks.  Yeah, that's pretty bad, dude.  You should have a copy of Heaven.  I need a hug.  That's pretty bad there, Tom.  But, you know, what are you going to do?  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  I want to say hi to Eddie, Dan, Jeremy, John.  All right.  Rock over London, rock over Chicago. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  Little smartasses.  This is a bore.  Yeah.  God, that sucks.  I'm going to pack a gum and a Bible.  We're going to break Anthony.  Yeah.  I think they're ruining our bit.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of others, but it's just not going anywhere.  No.  You know, what are you going to do?  The sisters don't seem to have as much good stuff.  I don't know.  I kind of like the black inches was pretty fun.  That was pretty fun.  We started off strong.  Chris.  What's going on, man? 
[01:42:30]  All right.  I found two things.  How old are you?  I'm 22 and my sister's 26.  Okay.  All right.  I found the Julie Eston's pink pocket rocket with stoomy sleeves or something like that.  It says ultra silent massager.  Yeah.  It says soft nubs for deep pleasure.  Soft nubs.  It says the ultimate traveling companion.  Oh, it's a little traveling one?  Battery powered?  Yep.  Good.  Good.  And I found like a box of commons. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a little freak.  She likes the dark meat, if you follow me.  Why?  What do you see there?  Well, because like her boyfriend is black.  Really?  Yeah.  She's got no smut laying around though to use?  Nope.  Nope.  That's interesting.  Other girls have the vibrating stuff, but they don't have the visual stimulus.  She's dating a black guy.  Does she have bail money in her drawer?  How does dad feel about that, Chris?  Well, my father really don't know because, you know, we're Italian. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, boy.  So, you know, she keeps that under wraps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know what I'm talking about.  I hear you there, Chris.  All right, guys.  All right, Chris.  All right, bye.  Why can't somebody find something really interesting like a big dill, a picture of Jim Norton,  a little thing of AZT?  That would be a nice combination.  Hey, Rick, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Susie Bake Oven.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I'm not snooping in my little sister's bedroom, but I do have a story I thought related 
[01:44:00]  to what we're talking about.  It might find amusing.  Okay.  Back a few years back, I had a carpet cleaning business, and we showed up at this lady's  house.  And then walking through the house, she said, I want you to clean all the bedrooms, and  I want you to move all the furniture, which included her daughter's room, of course.  Mm-hmm.  So we're plowing away, and we get into the daughter's bedroom, start moving furniture  around, and we pull the bed out.  Yeah.  And underneath the bed, you're just not going to believe this, a jar of Vaseline. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  A roll of toilet paper, and you know those little baseball bats they give out at the  baseball field for bat day?  The little mini ones?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So you guys put the puzzle together.  That is so hot.  Oh, well, check this out.  That is so hot.  Oh, yeah.  We were still there, and the daughter came home from lunch.  Yeah.  From work.  And the look on her face, it just said it all.  We just, we had a good chuckle. 
[01:45:00]  Because she knew it was there, that's for sure.  Oh, absolutely.  And the fact that, you know, everything in her room, even though we put it back in place,  you could tell was still, you know, just slightly out of place.  Needless to say, we put the toilet paper, the Vaseline back where it belonged.  Especially since she used Vaseline.  That's the beauty of her.  That's such an awful old, that's like whale blubber.  Vaseline.  Not using lard.  Oh, yeah.  That is.  Yes, I'm on.  Well, she wanted to make sure she got that. 
[01:45:30]  We know.  We know.  Yeah.  You know what you should have done, though?  You should have just taken your clothes off, laid under the bed, and have your junk position  right where the bat was, and just wait.  Just sit there, lay there, and wait for nightfall.  Yeah.  Did you find that?  It's just what she lets her pit bulls show on.  Yeah.  Vaseline's good for his teeth.  Yeah, that's right.  Keep some shiny.  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  Hey, long time, Lister.  Appreciate everything you do.  You guys are great.  We'll try it.  Oh, Rick, Rick, Rick. 
[01:46:00]  Everyone's on to you.  Don, what's up?  Hello.  Where are you, Don?  Hey, guys.  I'm in Rose O'Donnell's house.  We're going to go in our drawers.  Shut up.  You dick.  Are you guys ready?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me see what we got here.  Hold on.  All right.  We got a happy and Big Mac.  We got a, oh, she must be a skydiver.  I found a parachute.  No, that's a pair of a panty.  We got a, oh, I found a book here.  Hold on.  Let me see what it says. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  How to Adopt and Abuse Black Kids.  You don't have no black kids, you douche.  What in the head of you?  I don't know.  There's a book I found.  I don't know.  I can show you that.  Lots of Oreo cookies.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We got it.  Thank you.  All right, Mitch.  Thank you, Don.  All right.  Is Lady Di here yet?  Not yet, huh?  No?  The Lady Di exam is on the way.  We got our sixth grade history exam in front of us.  How great would it be if she couldn't show up if some mental patient pushed her in front 
[01:47:00]  of a train?  And you ever see footage of, like, somebody caught between the train and the...  Oh, isn't that great?  Oh, yeah.  And they squeeze between the platform and the train, and they got to get the jacks out  and everything and try to push the train.  But they actually will bring family members down because they open it up, the body's still  up.  That's great.  Yeah.  You can just go down there and tease them.  Smack their face.  I could only hope that happens to her.  Open your mouth.  You're dropping out of school to become a stripper seems like a fun thing to do. 
[01:47:30]  Heather.  Hello?  What?  Hello?  Hi, Heather.  Hello?  So, what do you want?  I want to come on the show again.  F-all.  What?  Hello?  What?  I want to come on the show again.  No!  What?  Never?  Why not?  You're very boring, Heather.  What?  I'm boring?  Hello?  Well, you're a certifiable lunatic.  What?  You're very, very, very annoying.  I'm annoying?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  You guys don't like me?  You're a friggin' moron. 
[01:48:00]  You're a stupid jerk.  You shut up.  Hello?  What?  What?  What?  You stupid bitch.  You are smarter than me, right?  Kiss my ass too, honey, because it's so sweet.  Stop!  Yeah!  What?  You whore!  You don't want me to come back to the show?  Is that what you're saying?  You're out of your mind.  Don't you listen to the show, whores or one-trick ponies?  The Opie and Anthony Joe reminds you to please stay in school. 
[01:48:30]  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And I'm laughing historically like mad.  Ah, Bud Lights.  Bud Light.  You bring Bud Light, that party starts.  That's it.  Whenever there's a hot party, you always notice Bud Lights there.  It's right there in the cooler.  Lift the top.  What the hell's that beer?  Get that out of the way.  Move that ice.  There it is.  I see it there lingering below the surface.  You reach in, pull that out.  Oh, icy cold.  Perfect for partying during the summer.  Perfect. 
[01:49:00]  You're at the beach.  What are you doing?  Backyard barbecue?  Hmm?  You're out there playing some volleyball.  You can't be weighed down with a heavy beer.  No.  But you still want beer that tastes good.  Right?  Opie?  Right.  I'm just reading the phone, bro.  I know.  I just like when you have to turn around and say, right.  Right.  Bud Light, right?  Exactly.  It's Bud Light, right?  It's Bud Light.  You're talking about Bud Light?  I keep.  I pay attention.  Your summer fun alive with what? 
[01:49:30]  Um.  Bud Light.  Oh, yeah.  Bud Light.  We're waiting for the arrival of Lady Di.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where is that annoying bitch?  We got a little test for her to take today, Anthony.  What do we do to her if she stands us up?  Ah, it's over.  Then it's just, we have to kill her.  This is the last ditch effort for her.  People have been voting all week on opianthony.com, whether she should stay or go. 
[01:50:00]  Go there now if you have not voted.  And check out the latest contestants for the WOW content.  Michelle, what's going on?  Oh, you know what?  You guys suck.  It looks so bad.  My slimy little 14-year-old step-brother called me up about 10 minutes ago.  He's like, you're back to him.  I've done for you, George, the Opie and Anthony show.  So, you know what?  Throw him.  I'll call you guys myself and tell you what he's going to find.  All right.  What is your little brother going to find in your room? 
[01:50:30]  Um, he's going to find a little pocket rocket with a dolphin on the top.  With a dolphin on the top?  Yeah.  Does that work for you?  Well, it's just consistent with the smell.  I heard that.  Michelle, how old are you?  I'm 23.  All right.  And how old is your little brother?  14.  Uh-huh.  So he snoops around.  He's going to find two pornos.  Movies.  Which ones? 
[01:51:00]  One is, um, play school.  Play school?  Is it spelled with a C-H or a K?  S-C-H.  And what is that about?  I don't really watch it for the storyline, you know?  Really?  What is it?  Guy and girl action?  It's a guy and a girl, and then it's two girls, and then it's two girls and a guy.  What part in there, really, do you save for the moment of truth?  Um, probably the two guys and a girl. 
[01:51:30]  I mean, the two girls and a guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you save the guy's money shot for when you want to, uh, let him?  Yeah, I don't need to see him be happy to get happy.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  Anything else?  Oh, what's the other porno?  The other one?  It's called put out or get out.  You got a little slut side in you, don't you?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really embarrassing because I was a Catholic school girl for eons. 
[01:52:00]  I was the only Catholic school girl to hold on to my virginity past the age of 16.  Wow.  Yeah, huh?  But, yeah, it's always been under wraps, but I figured I'd rather get it out myself than  have someone else rat me out.  What do we expect from put out or get out?  What kind of movie is that?  Everything.  You're a filthy whore!  Everything from, from, everything. 
[01:52:30]  Anal, forward, backwards, upside down, hanging from the roof, whatever.  Put out or get out.  That's great.  Isn't that a great title?  Ah, it should be the state motto.  Put out or get out.  It should be the state motto.  Wow, that's pretty good stuff.  It was a secret up until you guys had to do this today, so.  You still live at your parents' house?  Yeah.  And you take care of yourself in there?  You got to be quiet?  Yeah.  My parents, my father, my whole family is actually very Italian. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Is your bedroom, is your bedroom near your parents?  Yeah.  Just put out or get out a movie, or is that Dad's rules?  Hey, Michelle.  Movie Norton, you stick pig.  You got a VCR and a TV in your bedroom?  Of course.  And what, do you turn it on with the volume off?  Yeah, you just, I just viewed it and I put a CD in my CD player.  Any close calls?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, very, a lot.  I almost got nailed by my sister, actually, just last week. 
[01:53:30]  Really?  Because I have, well, I have the thing with the dolphin on it, and then I have a still that lights up.  You were using both?  No, but they both happened to be out at the time.  Well, you might switch a little bit, you know?  You got to go to your backup weapon.  No, no, because at the moment of truth, at the moment of truth, it's nice to have something other than the dolphin there.  Right.  So, so what happened?  She went to open my door, and I had forgotten to lock it. 
[01:54:00]  Uh-oh.  I was like, oh, no!  I, like, throw myself against the door.  She goes, why won't you open the door?  I'm like, um, getting changed.  How old is your sister?  She's 17.  Oh, so she's probably got her own dolphin in her room.  Probably.  But I'd rather her not see mine.  That's funny.  The dolphin.  Like I said, I'm the good girl in my family.  Yes, you are good.  Put out a genital.  What can I say?  My ex-boyfriend was a jerk and had no clue what he was doing. 
[01:54:30]  Somebody had to take care of it.  Goddamn guys, man.  Amazing.  What state do you live in?  New York, right?  Jersey.  Jersey?  Okay.  Jersey girl.  You don't have a boyfriend right now?  No.  You do now.  All right, Michelle.  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  Norton, you're awesome.  I love you, man.  Thank you, Michelle.  You're a lot of fun, Michelle.  Thank you.  I'll talk to you guys later.  All right, cool.  No boyfriend of dolphins worn down to a guppy.  She's got to go back.  Look at this thing. 
[01:55:00]  Down to a nub's nothing.  Oh, that's so great.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Yo, how's it going?  All right.  Okay, 15 just went through my sister's stuff and found a dill here.  Do you have the dill?  Is it running?  No.  Sounds like it from your phone connection.  Are you sitting on it?  No.  It's like a clear one and still has spikes hanging out of it and stuff.  I got to say, I don't have much confidence in the kids today like we did the other day. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Turn that thing on, Chris.  What?  It's not a vibrator.  Oh, it's just a dill.  It's a regular rubber one.  Anything else there, Chris?  Yeah, I got some strange little balls, rubber to steel balls.  Then what?  I don't know what the hell she does with this.  Let's hear the ball.  Ready?  Yeah.  I'll clank them two together.  Well, she got an old medieval mace. 
[01:56:00]  It's click clacks.  What the hell is that?  Well, she's either a whore or she's jousting.  Maybe she's in the barn, dude.  How should I know?  You never know there, Chris.  All right, Chris, thank you.  Thank you.  I'll see you later.  All right, bye.  His phone connection, he was talking through the dill.  That's funny.  God, Michelle was a trooper.  She gave up...  She gave everything up her secrets.  I love that.  Virgil, what's up?  Hey, dude, I saw this movie the chick is talking about. 
[01:56:30]  It's the dirtiest flick you've ever seen.  My guy spitting in the...  Oh.  And a team of black guys just totally mauling this one chick.  What movie is this?  Put Out of Get Out.  Oh, well, it's put in a place.  I don't know.  Wow, that sounds like a hot movie.  So it's the dirtiest one.  Boy, everyone with the S-word.  With the potty mouth.  I'm sorry.  People love that S-word.  This doesn't sound like a radio show.  I know.  We're just yapping.  We're just hanging.  I'm out.  All right, thank you. 
[01:57:00]  That's always cool, though, when you think of the sister's room.  You ever go over to your friend's house or something like that,  and you've got a sister, and maybe his room is next to it,  and you look inside,  and it's just that whole aura of the sister's room  that used to actually get you excited.  It's true.  You go over to your friend's house,  and, like, he's got the older sister.  There was a friend of mine, I can't even remember the name,  but he had a sister, older sister,  and it was so mysterious.  Her name was Winnie, I believe.  Winnie?  Winnie. 
[01:57:30]  The Wonder Years.  Like the Wonder Years name, yeah.  But it was just so girly and stuff,  and when you're a kid, and you're,  I guess we were about, I don't know,  eight or nine at the time,  and you just look at that, the girl room,  it was just something that you'd like,  look, everything, the smell that came out of it,  just, like, everything got so hot.  Would she run around wearing nothing but a red shirt  and eating honey?  No.  That's the poo.  That's Tigger.  No, no, no, that's something she's dating.  My father said it's close. 
[01:58:00]  I've got a deal under my bed, Tigger.  I rub a little honey on the honeypot.  Woo-hoo, wonderful.  Look, I'm bouncing.  Hey, Wendy.  Yeah.  What's up, Wendy?  I'm in my brother's room.  Oh.  And I also have a...  Turnabout is fair play.  What's good for the moose is good for the gander.  Ha, ha, ha.  If I do.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:58:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ooh, six to one, half a dozen of the other.  Hey, I'll bet you dollars to donuts.  I think he's a freak.  What, your brother?  Oh, I know he's a freak with what I'm finding.  Uh-oh.  So you've got a 22-year-old brother.  You all live under the same roof.  And I have an older sister who's on her way home, too, so I've already been in her room.  We kind of got the same kind of tools, though.  Oh, you have some tools also.  Oh, definitely.  Well, let's start with the brother's room. 
[01:59:00]  What are you finding in your 22-year-old brother's room?  Okay, there's this thing.  It has a rabbit on the end, and then it has two of those little vibrating balls that slide in on the sides.  And he's supposed to put his...  Junk.  Okay, in the middle.  And it has, like, two remotes.  What the hell is this thing?  Is he buying a DVD player?  I don't even know.  I don't know what the heck this thing is.  Well, Tennessee, first you put your junk in it, then there's a couple of balls when you plug it in and flip the remote. 
[01:59:30]  Whoopee!  I can't even picture it in my head.  Wait a minute.  Is it a tube, a cylinder?  No, it's kind of...  Oh, I don't even know how you'd describe this.  You've got everything in plastic.  Thank God.  It's in plastic bags?  Like, how is it supposed to stimulate anything?  I think these little, the metal balls go in, like, one goes in between the one rabbit's head, and then there's another on the other side. 
[02:00:00]  Picture the man's junk in the center.  Right.  And then on two sides, there's, like, one's a rabbit and one's just a circle.  Oh, is it like a C ring?  Yeah.  That goes around it, and then there's two things on the ring that touches the junk and, like, does things?  And they have the vibrating balls.  All right.  All right.  And they each have, like, their own remote.  Can you turn it on?  Yeah, but I'm, well, I ain't touching this thing.  Oh, it's in the plastic, you said, right?  Can you put it on your nose? 
[02:00:30]  Come on, turn it on.  Okay, wait a minute.  You can wash.  Oh.  That was just the one?  Wow.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  It's called the Swedish erotica.  Swedish erotica.  Let's hear that again.  Okay.  Hold on.  I'm going to try and put it on slow, slow.  I don't know.  Oh, God.  Oh, it sputters.  I think it's broken.  That sounds like some kind of phasers or something. 
[02:01:00]  I don't know.  I mean, it has two remotes.  Two separate remotes?  What does the other remote do?  No, they're both for the little balls.  Yeah, oh, it's just on either side or something?  Yeah.  And then, like, I mean, you have a picture of a rabbit on it.  Everything.  It's kind of cute.  I might have to go to purchase one.  That's classic.  What else have you found?  I found some sensual hot wax.  Okay.  I found a silver vibrator. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  What the hell he got that for?  What do you think he uses that for?  He burned out of his cell.  Not as many people I know that go in that room.  Oh, no.  Does he bring girls over?  Oh, we, we, the three of us sneak them in through our windows because we each have our own room.  Oh, so you sneak guys in and...  I sneak them.  My sister doesn't have to, but...  Yeah.  He sneaks in.  Hey, what's this?  Hey, if you want to know what he uses that for, run it under your nose like a cigar.  Oh, are you crazy?  Isn't that bad?  What else did you just find? 
[02:02:00]  There's this little, it looks like a bobby pin, but it has like some pearls at the end  of it.  Like a bobby pin with, with pearls on the end.  Gee, I wonder what you pull them out of.  I don't know.  It's in plastic.  I don't care.  Everything is...  Any porno?  Oh, heck yeah.  Yeah?  There's a load of porno in our house hidden.  Those are beads, by the way.  There's like this one.  Black booty cam number four.  Black booty cam number four. 
[02:02:30]  This is the one that's in the VCR.  That's classic.  Hey, I think we've got to cut Wendy short because a lady dies outside the scene.  Oh, okay.  Well, Wendy, thank you so much.  That was pretty funny.  Thank you.  I love you, Wendy.  Oh, thank you.  All right, Wendy.  Bye.  That's funny because Nick on Line 9 says that the Swedish erotica thing made it sound  like that monster when he was fighting Godzilla.  Wee!  Mantra or whatever?  Yeah, yeah.  It was the three-headed one, right?  Ghidra. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, yeah, okay.  Ghidra.  Quick break, Anthony.  Lady Di comes in and takes a sixth grade exam.  Great.  Stay there.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to go to Melanie really fast.  She knows what that body clip was, Anthony.  Oh.  That that sister found in her brother's room just before the break.  Melanie.  Yeah, hey.  Yeah, that sister, she found some kind of body clip and you know what that is?  I know what that is.  Okay.  That's a little man in the canoe ring or like a sea ring for the little man in the canoe. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  Yeah, it sort of looks like a bobby pin, but it has jewels hanging off at the end of the  steps that doesn't separate, but it does separate.  And like an old style curtain rod on us.  You know what I mean?  But aren't those beads, though, like for placing and pulling out for a guy?  No?  Say that again.  Is it for the girl or the guy?  It's for the girl.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You kind of lock it around the man in the boat?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  It wraps around and it gets engorged. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, I'm allowed to say engorged.  And it gets real happy and it feels real good.  It kind of just keeps everything in there.  All right.  There you go.  Nice.  Do you know what I mean?  Yes.  We got you now.  Yeah, and it's pretty.  It's jewelry.  Oh, very nice.  It's gorgeous.  So it's functional and aesthetic.  Thank you, Melanie.  You're welcome.  All right.  Bye, guys.  We've got to push along because we're running out of show.  Let the door open, Anthony.  Get the mess in here.  Who are you?  It's Lady Di. 
[02:04:30]  Lady Di.  You guys have to vote if she should stay or go on opianthony.com.  There's one last thing we're going to do with her to help you with the voting.  Well, she works away and I'll have a secret message to John from Washington, D.C.  Really?  Really?  Ah, that's rich. 
[02:05:00]  There you go.  There she is.  Lady Di.  Wearing her mustache.  Is that electrical tape or something that's going to stick?  I hope it sticks.  Don't let it keep falling off of your face.  Can you wipe the sweat off your mouth?  Maybe that would suck.  Yeah.  That hat.  Is there any reason she's dressed like Serpico?  Yeah, what is that?  It's a hat.  It's a North North hat.  Why?  What's with a hat?  A hat.  A North thing. 
[02:05:30]  It's a nice hat.  It's not a...  If you're on Golden Pond, it's a nice hat.  That's great.  All right, well, we've got to get right into the test.  Okay.  How old are you?  How old am I?  You know.  No, I don't.  I might say 40.  Wearing a Betty Boop shirt that says, good things come in small packages.  Oh, my God.  Why would you wear a shirt that says, good things come in small packages?  Because it's a cute shirt.  That's why.  It's not a cute shirt.  And were they sold out a shirt that said, stupid things come in fat, awful packages? 
[02:06:00]  No.  Wouldn't you know?  It's extra large, too.  But wouldn't you know that someone would read that shirt and think, why is she wearing that?  Because she's not a small package.  Yeah, well, I did get stared at with the shirt on, so...  You're not good, you are a thing, you never come, and you're a fat package.  Thank you, Jim.  I love you, too.  The shirt's completely wrong.  Look.  I feel bad you have...  That mustache has to stay on.  And if you cannot keep that on, we will...  Get a marker.  Get a marker.  Use a marker. 
[02:06:30]  A marker.  What's wrong with a marker?  You can wipe it off.  It comes right off.  You went to the bathroom, you used the soap and the solution, you wipe it right off.  Put the marker on.  We're going to draw a mustache.  Even your mustache stinks today.  Is it washable?  Yes.  Of course it's washable.  No, it's on forever.  Ever.  They used it on the pyramids.  Yeah, it's a tattoo.  Yeah, Rick is drawing the mustache.  Rick's drawing the mustache.  I really don't like her awful shorts.  No, I didn't.  On her right now.  I feel bad she has to pay more to fly. 
[02:07:00]  That's a good question.  Do you want to pay more to fly?  Yeah, pay more to fly.  Huh?  Huh?  It's a fat joke, you ass.  Yeah, Rick, just do it quickly.  Stop moving.  And stop sweating.  Yeah.  Impossible.  Anthony, while Rick puts the mustache on Lady Di...  Yeah.  By the way, Rick's going to have to leave the show shortly so he can fly.  Oh, that's right.  He's going to see Uh-Ha this weekend.  Rick's going overseas. 
[02:07:30]  Shut up.  We're not talking to you.  Rick's going to England.  Stop moving your fat face.  Yeah.  Your Harvey Keitel body.  All right, Anthony, we got the test in front of us.  We should explain what we're going to do here.  That one will stay for a little bit.  For the next hour, we need everybody that is associated with this radio show, as a listener,  a faithful listener, to go to opianthony.com and vote whether Lady Di should stay or go.  This is very serious, okay?  Okay.  And we want...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And we want you to take your vote very seriously, Anthony. 
[02:08:00]  Right?  Right.  So go to opianthony.com and vote if Lady Di should stay or go.  But we need everyone that is a faithful listener of this show to vote.  First, we have in our hands a sixth-grade test that we want Lady Di to take live on the air.  Sixth-graders take this test.  I'll take that test.  Well, that's why you're here.  I know.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  I didn't know that until now, so... 
[02:08:30]  Oh, it's like...  It's an elementary school test, so it's grades three through six.  Three through six.  Yeah.  Great.  She doesn't have the test in front of her, right?  No.  Okay.  And, Ben, you have to keep track of the voting for us on opianthony.com.  We need everyone to vote.  I'm dead serious.  And I know the obvious vote is kick her off the show.  I just want you guys to think before you vote.  Yeah.  Think of the potential is what I'm trying to say.  The big picture is what we're looking at here.  Right.  I looked at that last night. 
[02:09:00]  Huge picture.  And I have to say, the 25% that voted for me, thank you very much.  She's...  Yeah, she's losing the vote very badly.  Every time you open your mouth, either something stupid is coming out of it or something fattening  is going into it.  No.  That is not true.  Yeah, right now, Anthony, only 23% of the people want her to stay.  23%.  And I are just hoping that you guys look at the big picture.  Right.  Please, look at the big picture here.  We're talking entertainment potential. 
[02:09:30]  That's right.  That we're looking for.  But 76% want her out of here.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  I saw that last night.  You said that already.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did.  You thanked them and everything.  Maybe you should go through it again.  Right.  Somebody just tuned in.  And I guess we're just going to make this very casual.  Uh-huh.  We're just going to pick questions off the test here.  Nice hat.  All right.  Awful.  I'll start it in.  It's like Trapper John 8 Hawkeye.  It looks like a fisherman's hat. 
[02:10:00]  I like it.  I think it looks good.  Yeah.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  Guys, we're running out of time.  Oh, we are.  God damn it.  Badly.  We'll start with an easy one, Ann, okay?  Okay.  I'll ask the first question to Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Okay.  Yeah.  Something we discussed the other day.  When did Columbus land in America?  1892.  All right.  Mark that down.  No, we just...  No, we can go...  We can...  We can discuss after each question. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Did he land in America?  Are you reading multiple choices?  Wrong!  Try again, dumbass!  Jesus.  All right.  You got one wrong so far.  One wrong.  One wrong.  1892.  Why do you think it was 1892?  I don't know.  I thought I read that in the history book, so I don't know.  All right.  Maybe I got one thing to do with the other.  You know how long ago 1892 is?  Yeah.  It's not that long ago.  It's not that long ago.  It was a long time ago.  110 years exactly. 
[02:11:00]  And there's a lot of American history, a lot of world history.  All right.  It's 1492.  Oh, well, there she goes.  She just saw it.  It's too late, though.  Let's get that down.  Too late.  It's too late.  Okay.  All right, Ant.  Wrong answer.  The question goes to you.  All right.  Then go to opandanthony.com.  We want to see if the vote is changing at all.  No, it's not changing yet.  No.  Go ahead, Ant.  And the website getting slammed.  Good. 
[02:11:30]  When did the War of 1812 actually start?  Ah.  The multiple choice, 1810, 1811, 1812, or yesterday?  1810.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  It's the War of 1812.  It started 1810, right?  No.  It didn't.  It started in 1812.  1810 is your cholesterol. 
[02:12:00]  No, it's not.  My cholesterol is good.  Of course it is.  It's normal.  Yeah.  Pudding.  Pudding running through those veins.  Pudding.  Shouldn't have my cholesterol eating plankton all day.  Eating what all day?  That's question 25.  All right.  Okay.  Do you know who the first president of the United States was?  George Washington.  All right, but that's not the question.  Okay. 
[02:12:30]  Who was the second president of the United States?  The second president of these United States.  Abraham Lincoln?  Why should we give a choice?  It's the second president.  I might not be able to get that without you.  All right, we'll give a multiple choice.  Go ahead.  All right.  Give her a multiple choice.  Samuel Adams.  John Adams.  John Quincy Adams.  Gomez Adams.  John Quincy Adams. 
[02:13:00]  We'll get that one.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  I'm trying.  0 for 3.  John Adams.  This is an exam that third graders, third to sixth grade.  Take.  Marion.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  I'll be right here today.  Hey, Marion.  How you doing?  Hey, guys.  I had to call up because you know why?  I think you guys should throw her off the shelf for about me.  Why?  Diane, you know why.  We discussed this last night. 
[02:13:30]  I'm not going to get into it on the air.  Get into it.  No, no, no.  You have to get into it on the air.  You know what?  Let me tell you one thing.  She thinks more about herself than she does anybody else.  That is not true.  Diane, it is, too, and you know it.  Let me tell you one thing right now.  You should stop going around telling people you're a celebrity.  I'm not telling people I'm a celebrity.  Who did I say that to?  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  We discussed this last night.  You want me to start?  I will start.  Believe me.  No, don't start.  Don't start.  Believe me.  I will start. 
[02:14:00]  Marion, how did this conversation get started?  You know what?  I'm going to tell you how it got started.  This week, I've been trying to get her to do more stuff.  Walking, going out, doing this, doing that.  She's right about that.  Let me tell you something.  She sits home every night with a bottle in her mouth.  I don't have a bottle in my mouth.  Yes, you do.  You're not even there.  Diane, don't lie to me.  I know you.  Because every time you talk to me, you're half in a bag.  How do you know that?  Because I can tell.  Come on.  You're stuttering.  You're fighting with me.  You're fighting with your father.  You're fighting with Emily.  I feel... 
[02:14:30]  You know what?  You're ridiculous.  You tell people you're a celebrity.  Everywhere you go.  I didn't tell anyone I was a celebrity.  Why would I do that?  Hey, Diane, you told me yesterday when you took your car, you had to get a rental car for  Enterprise because your car's falling apart.  You told people at Enterprise that you're a celebrity.  I did not tell them that.  You did?  I told them that I'd go on the show.  No.  And prize.  And prize.  Is it because you look like Peter Sellers in that head?  Yeah, because I look like Peter Sellers.  Let me tell you something, guys.  She should be thrown off the show for a month.  Maybe she'll straighten out her ass a little bit.  Wow. 
[02:15:00]  She should.  Whoa.  So you've been throwing your weight around, have you?  Yeah, I've been throwing my weight around.  That explains the earthquake we've been having in the United States.  She's been throwing a lot of weight.  And you know something, O.B. Anthony?  She has been fighting with me all week, and she's been fighting with her father and her  father's, you know, friends.  Oh, boy.  Because you know what it is?  She fights with everybody because the only thing that matters...  I don't fight with anybody.  It's true.  The only thing that matters is yourself.  All right.  I love O.B. and Anthony, too, and everybody up there. 
[02:15:30]  But you don't want to know what you're saying.  Thank you.  Everything gets tuned out.  Everything else in your life gets tuned out.  And it's not right.  What you're doing.  Lady Di, are you going to fight back or what?  I think you should get...  I don't know why she's saying these things.  At least for one month.  Maybe they'll flake you out your act.  I can't believe her.  We want you guys to catfight.  No, no, no.  Why would they be like...  Because she's already...  She's in now.  Now she's trying to get in, and you want her boot to go off the show?  I hope people do vote you off the show.  I'm believing. 
[02:16:00]  Why?  I was just on the Internet, and a lot of people want people...  Because you know why?  You don't know how to act.  Oh, come on.  Diane, it's true.  Every time I've been talking to you the last couple of days, you're stuttering.  You don't know what you're talking about.  You don't even know I'm calling you.  I mean, come on.  I know you were calling me.  No, you don't even know.  You're fighting with me on the phone every night.  What is wrong with you?  What was I...  What was I talking about?  You have...  Let me tell you one thing.  You have problems, and you act like you're the only one with problems?  Really?  All right, Marion.  All right, Marion. 
[02:16:30]  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Lady Di, you have nothing.  Your friend just destroyed you.  Destroyed you, man.  Well, because I listen to the show, and, you know, she gets...

Then again, not anyone has Down syndrome either. 
[02:20:00]  Next question for Lady Di.  Who has Down syndrome over here?  Marion.  Marion.  Yeah?  What do you think so far?  Let's do it.  Yeah, she's going to bash me again.  Put her off.  Let's do it.  She's going to bash me again.  Yeah, because you're jealous.  Because I went and got a t-shirt made up, Diane.  Because you even told me.  I didn't tell you anything like that.  Let's do it.  People in Hoos were saying they liked my t-shirt.  So you were kind of cringing to me. 
[02:20:30]  Don't tell me.  I like your t-shirt, too.  I didn't say anything.  Yeah, you want to get one made up because I got one.  What are you going to be?  Same, same, grow up.  Jesus Christ.  I want them to fight with their big, huge pocketbooks.  Those will grow up after.  What are you going to be?  Same, same.  Now they want us to wrestle.

And you look ridiculous.  What a fine mess I'm getting myself into over here.  Oh, she's doing, she's trying to get a catchphrase.  What a fine mess.  There's no way they're making a shirt with that drivel on it.  Hey, Marion. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah?  What do you think so far?  I think you should still put her off.  Why are you turning on her, Marion?  She's really annoying you lately.  Yeah, why are you doing that?  Hey, Jim, it's a long story, but if you'd call her up every night at 7.30, you'd want to know why.  Well, you were saying one night.  She's an alcoholic.  Yeah, she was a drunk and that she was obnoxious to everybody.  Marion was pretty much saying she's an alcoholic.  Yeah, she fights with everybody.  You can't even talk to anyone.  I'm not fighting with anyone right now.  Don't lie to me.  She's calling you a liar, man.  Yep.  You fight with everybody in your family, including me.  You know, you're doing everybody out in your family, and you just worry about yourself. 
[02:24:00]  That is not true.  When I talk to you, you're like, oh, well, you don't know.  I have these problems and that problem.  Let me tell you one thing.  I have a lot of problems, too, but I don't go around feeling sorry for myself because I got problems.  Okay, Marion.  You have nothing to say back to her.  Yeah, all you do is go, no, I don't.  Yeah, okay, Marion.  Jeff, real fast.  I don't know.  Why don't you have a little gumption?  I'm dying, guys.  All right.  She's killing me.  Yes, I know.  You're a social studies teacher?  Yeah.  I got seven pretty kids that would score higher than she is right now.  Of course. 
[02:24:30]  Of course.  Probably.  Thank you.  Anthony, why don't you get a few of these out?  All right.  What's the nickname for New York State?  The Big Apple.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  You really should know this since you took Fay Wray up the side of this.  Yeah.  Complete ass.  The official name, not for the city, tourism, not for the tourism, for the city, the state  of New York is the Empire State.  The Empire State. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  The Big Apple.  Say it now.  All right.  Grab the next one.  When Ronald Reagan said the evil empire, who was he talking about?  The evil empire?  Yes.  The evil empire.  When he mentioned the evil empire, who was Ronald Reagan talking about?  Um, I don't know.  I just don't know.  You want to give answers?  Was it the Democratic Party?  Mm-hmm.  Was it the People's Republic of China? 
[02:25:30]  Was it the Soviet Union?  Or was it the Clintons?  The Soviet Union.  Oh, thank you.  That was such a gimme.  All right.  What is water, also known as?  H02, H202, H20, R2D2.  H20.

[02:26:30]  Go over the answers later when you're drinking, according to Marion.  What ridiculous question is 20, Rick?  That's not even true.  What is that question?

Did you read what Dummy wrote?  He had wooded teeth.  Wooded.  Nice.  And the wooded is it. 
[02:27:00]  Trees and shrubs around his mouth.  All right.  All right.  Let's move on.  Lady Di, who shot Abraham Lincoln?  I'm not giving choices.  You should just know.  You should know this stuff.  I'm not going to give choices for the real easy ones.  Who shot Abraham Lincoln?  I forgot.  I don't know.  That was a long time ago.  It was a long time ago, yeah.  Do I have to give choices?  Now, I don't.  I think that should be wrong.  If you don't automatically know who shot Lincoln. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  No.  You don't know who shot Abraham Lincoln?  No.  I forgot right now.  You get it wrong.  You get it wrong.  But I'll give you a choice and see if you get it right.  Okay.  Lee Harvey Oswald, John Lee Hooker, John Wilkes Booth, or Jack Ruby?  John Wilkes Booth.  See?  You should know that.  I'm not refreshing your goddamn memory on these things.  It's wrong.  Wrong.  Who were the Redcoats?  Who were the Redcoats? 
[02:28:00]  I don't know.  People fighting a war.  I'm not sure.  Wow.  That's okay.  Were you an idiot?  No, of course not.  I don't know.  The Redcoats.  Give me the choices.  No, it was during the Revolutionary War.  No choices on that one.  Body density of Jupiter.  You should know that.  Who were the Redcoats?  It was during the Revolutionary War.  It was during the Revolutionary War.  During the Revolutionary War.  Third graders know this.  The Redcoats.  I used to know that.

Jesus.  All right.  A couple more and we've got to take a break.  That was the British.  The British.  Okay.  Go ahead, Ant.  Thank you for telling me that.  Who discovered gravity?  Give me the multiple choices.  Just look at your body. 
[02:29:30]  You should know that.  Why do we have to give you choices?  I'll give our choices on this one.  Isaac Newton, Galileo, Copernicus, or Sigmund Freud?  Sir Isaac Newton.  Galileo.  Bam.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Sir Isaac Newton.  Oh, okay.  What do you mean, okay?  I bet you we could ask you the same question in two minutes.  You'll know the answer. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, okay.  Marion?  Ed Norton?  Ed Norton?  All right.  Who discovered electricity, Lady Di?  Thomas Edison.  Give me that one.  You got me.  She's wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Wow.

I didn't even look at the third choice. 
[02:31:00]  I got that wrong.  That's why she's wrong.  That's when he was working for Ford.  That was wrong?  Yeah, that was wrong.  Trick question.  Trick question.  Trick question.  That was a trick question.  Electricity one.  Uncle John wants to say, we all know Paul Revere shouted, Germans are coming, the Germans  are coming.  One more, Anthony, before we take a break.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You know what?  That one's too hard, so we'll go with an easier one.  Yeah.  Okay.  Eli Whitney is famous for inventing what?  Eli Whitney. 
[02:31:30]  Who's in the good, the bad, and the ugly?  Mad cow disease, the cotton gin, whiskey, the automobile.  The cotton gin.  See, you gave her the choice.  Every kid knows.  If there's one inventor that you know as a kid, it's Eli Whitney and his stupid cotton gin.  You've got to give her that one, though, because I don't even know what a cotton gin is.  No one does, but you know Eli Whitney invented it.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  We'll finish the exam next, Ed. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  You've got to go to opanthony.com and vote if she should stay or go.  We need all the faithful listeners to do that.  She has so far, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  I've got a question about my history.  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 wrong, Anthony.  All right.

[02:32:30]  And you're getting the third grade ones right.  Maybe you could be your history.  I'm getting the third degree, too.  While you're on the trip.  You know what?  I was going to say something.  I'm going to let that one just bomb on its own.  You've got a war face.  What the heck?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh!  Oh, s***, you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  All right. 
[02:33:00]  We only have ten minutes left of the program.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Lady Di in the studio taking her test.  What's the level of this test?  Third grade to sixth grade?  That's what it is.  And Stinky's keeping track of the rights and the wrongs.  Where are we at, Stink?  We've got nine right and 15 wrongs.  All right.  Nine right, 15 wrongs.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Now, this next question, very easy.  Very easy.  You're not getting multiple choice for this one.  All right. 
[02:33:30]  Who was the first man to walk on the moon?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No, it was not Jesus Christ.  He invented the moon.  Just think it...  His dad made it.  Actually, it was his dad.  I would have got that one wrong.  First man.  Think of your body with space moves walking on it.  Well, we're waiting.  Anything?  Say it.  No, I don't know. 
[02:34:00]  You don't know the first man who walked on the goddamn moon.  Jesus Christ, it's like the biggest thing ever.  You should know the first, the second, and the guy that circled while they walked.  Right.  Well, I'm thinking right now.  I'm thinking.  Oh, yeah.  You sure you are?  That just might be indigestion.  All right.  John Smith.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass. 
[02:34:30]  Why would you guess John Smith?  Do you know any astronauts?  Wouldn't you guess an astronaut?  Pick an American astronaut.  Name one astronaut.  Name one American astronaut from any time period.  One.  Everyone shut up.  One American astronaut.  Name one astronaut.  Okay, Sam Smith.  You can't name one astronaut.  Not offhand.  Not right now.  How do you survive? 
[02:35:00]  Can you?  Well, I work.  That's what I do.  That's amazing.  You can't name one astronaut.  Not offhand.  Not right now.  Never.  I have to brush up on my history.  What can I say?  Brush up on your history is not knowing when the Magna Carta was signed.  Right.  You have to brush up on your genetic pool if you don't know who landed on the moon first.  Thank you.  You do have your tubes tied at this point, right?  God, I hope so. 
[02:35:30]  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Nothing going in there anyway.  It doesn't matter.  You know what tubes are you?  Never mind.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Ann.

He's the most famous director of the FBI ever.  What's the name of the cross-dressing former director of the FBI?  He started the FBI.  Yeah.  He started the FBI.  That's it.  Repeat it.  That will help.  Yeah.  What does the FBI stand for?  Well, that's good.  Fat, bumbling idiot.  Federal Bureau of Investigations. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  That wasn't the question.  That's not the question, though.  That wasn't the question.  Now, who was the first guy who was known for cross-dressing?  I don't know.  Nothing.  Well, why don't you give me the multiple choices?  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  No, because it's a bunch of goof guys and the real guy.  J. Edgar Hoover.  Oh, okay.  Did you know that?  Now I know.  Now that he's telling me, I remember now. 
[02:37:00]  And he later went on to make what household cleaning device?  The Hoover vacuum cleaner.  Wrong, idiot.  Wrong, idiot.  All right.  What was his name again?  She sounds like, got to give me that one.  The Hoover vacuum cleaner.  What was his name?  What was his name?  What was his name?  James.  James.  James Edgar Hoover.  James?  James Edgar Hoover.

What is the imaginary line that separates the Earth's two hemispheres?  Little science here.  The equator.  Oh, no.  I got that one.  You sure did.  You're a smart one.  Could have just as easily been your belt.  No.  How long does it take the Earth to rotate? 
[02:38:00]  24 hours.  Oh, she's creeping up now.  Where are we at, Stink?  How many right?  How many wrong?  12 right.  17 wrong.  That's not so bad.  It stinks.  It's not even a 50.  This is not a Princeton admission exam.  It's like third and sixth graders.  The Earth rotates on this imaginary line called? 
[02:38:30]  The equator.  Whoa.  Try again, dumbass.  It's the first day of summer, but I think about four hours is going to be spring and winter  again, and then on the equator.  They like to call it the axis.  The axis?  Yes.  Go ahead.  Okay.  How many legs does a spider have?  13.  Why would you pick an even number, you twat? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  How could a...  Yeah, pick an even number.  12.  12.  Okay.  The last one was his mule dragon.  Oh, I'm trying to get you, dumbass.  8.  But even more amazing, she's obviously guessing, and she doesn't pick an even number.  I'm trying.  It wouldn't be an odd number unless he married McCartney.  When water changes...  That's not nice.  When water changes from liquid to gas, the process is called.  Can you give me the multiple choices on that?

[02:40:00]  Go ahead, Ann.  All right.  Please.  What planet is closest to the sun?  The Earth.  The Earth?  Venus?  Venus.  Do you know...  What was a TV show that starred John Lithgow as an alien that came to this planet?  What was it called?  Oh, I don't know. 
[02:40:30]  Third...  You ever hear of a show called Third Rock from the Sun?  You ever hear of that show?  Yeah, I heard of that show.  And do you know what that third rock from the sun is?  Earth.  So perhaps there's two other ones that are closer to the sun.  Do you know what those are?  Venus and Mars?  Did I get that one right?  No, stupid.  Okay.  You got one right.  It's not even funny anymore.  Saturn?  Yeah, that's closer to the Earth.  The closest planet to the sun is...  I'm amazed you can remember to eat.  You have no clue.  That's instinct. 
[02:41:00]  Bears don't plan on hibernating.  They just do it.  It's mercury.  We only got a minute left on the show, Ant.  So this will carry over to Monday, obviously.  But...  All right.  Who drafted the Declaration of Independence?  Who drafted the...  Jim.  Come on.  Who drafted the Declaration of Independence?  Everyone knows this one.  Benjamin Franklin.  Yes, while Edison was discovering electricity.  And Edison was off flying a kite.  You're wrong.

These are things that you just know as a human being, as an American, as somebody walking this planet.  How about this?  This is an easy one.  What is the name of the document that is the framework for our government?  The Declaration of Independence?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It's got to be.  It's got to be.  Are you messing with us? 
[02:42:00]  No, I'm not.  Right?  You're full around.  It's been a long time.  That's wrong, too.  What's the answer to that one?  The Magna Carta.  Everyone knows.  Oh, okay.  No way.  All right.  Well, we've got to get out of here.  You ever hear of the Constitution?  Yes, I heard of the Constitution.  Not constipation.  No, no.  Constitution.  I heard of that.  You obviously have building up in your bowels.  I don't know.  Stink?  What do we got?  13 right, 23 wrongs. 
[02:42:30]  What percent is that?  That's just over 33, I believe, right?  If I do it quick.  Yeah.  I'm surprised I got those 13 right.  About 35.  Have her figure out the percent.  About a 35.  On a test that third to sixth graders take.  Very good.  My son knows more about the history right now.  She has no spider mule.  13th leg.  She has no mule.  The 13th leg.
