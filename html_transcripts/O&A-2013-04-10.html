<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a Paul Anka interview, including a humorous anecdote from Opie about a photo with Anka that inadvertently featured a SiriusXM employee.  The low Twitter follower count for SiriusXM's Indy channel was also noted.  Opie then recounted a frustrating experience at an Islanders hockey game with his son, who repeatedly tried to hit him in the throat. This led to a conversation about disciplining children.  Jim Norton discussed his appearances on Tom Papa's show, a scheduling conflict, Bob Kelly's eye surgery and a Vine video of a seemingly high Kelly. This sparked a conversation about addiction, recovery, and the challenges faced by recovering addicts needing medication, referencing Bob Kelly and Ron Bennington.  They also discussed receiving calls from CVS about prescription refills.  The hosts then dissected Lindsay Lohan's tense, emotional interview with David Letterman, playing clips and offering their opinions.  The show transitioned to a discussion of Kim Kardashian's pregnancy appearance and Kanye West, segueing into a story about Sal's basketball game against younger black high schoolers, witnessed by Who Kid, who later contacted Sal and posted photos online, including discussion of Who Kid's online presence and candid discussion of infidelity.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of the hosts' strained relationship and limited morning conversations.  This was followed by an analysis of the success of Opie's YouTube videos, comparing views for videos featuring Sal, Troy, The Miz, and Opie himself, highlighting a new video, "Chip Meets the Bird People," featuring a profane encounter with bird protestors.  Comedian Dan Soder was announced as a guest.  The hosts discussed Jimmy's upcoming stand-up shows and Opie's anxieties about his parents attending.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to Fandango, his recent appearance, and the viral video of him being oiled down by Jimmy.  The hosts discussed Fandango’s persona and Wrestlemania, including their early departure. The conversation then turned extremely graphic, focusing on Opie's detailed description of his preferred porn star, Lisa Ann's physical attributes, and a lengthy, crude discussion of body hair preferences, involving Nicole, a staff member, in a discussion of body odor.  The segment concluded with a lengthy and vulgar analysis of Covino and Rich's radio show, their vocabulary, catchphrases, "Dude Bro Nation," and "nussie," including playing a song parody and analyzing their slang.

A subsequent segment largely focused on Covino and Rich’s vocabulary list from CovinoandRich.com, with Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Dan Soder joined by Kenny, a Covino and Rich superfan.  They discussed various slang terms, including euphemisms for sexual acts and body parts, with much humorous disbelief expressed, particularly regarding "jazzing." Rich himself called in to comment and explain some of the terms.  The conversation also covered Covino and Rich’s merchandise, listener base, convention, and Rich's stand-up appearances. A caller, Jeff, shared his opinion.  Brief mentions were made of Anthony Cumia's aggressive driving guide and the "Should I Suck a Dick or Not?" show with Joe DeRosa.  The segment ended with promotion for Louis C.K., Rolling Stone, and Dan Soder's Comedy Central special.  The entire segment was heavily laden with vulgar language and sexually suggestive content.

Another segment began with an explicit, sexually suggestive anecdote.  The conversation shifted to upcoming appearances by the hosts and Jim Norton, including Norton’s Caroline’s show and "Crossover" with Michelle Beadle.  They discussed Beadle's attractiveness and speculated on her relationship status. Jim Norton shared a text exchange with a woman he has a crush on. The discussion moved to Bubba Watson's public crying, leading to speculation about his emotional state and "dad bro" status.  The hosts made critical and often offensive comments about various co-workers (Ryan, Stan, Nicole, and Rich), focusing on Rich’s lack of eye contact and blinking.  A significant portion compared and contrasted radio shows ("Dude Bro Nation," "Cosmo Radio," and "Covino and Rich"), with disparaging remarks and explicit sexual references.  They discussed a radio host's low pay and inter-team rivalries.  Jim Norton’s comedy shows were heavily promoted. The show concluded with further discussion of a golfer's emotional displays and a segment with offensive, sexually explicit, and derogatory comments about celebrities; it also included an advertisement for an adult film featuring Anthony Cumia.  Recurring jokes involved sexually suggestive terms and offensive language, including "Tokyo" as a safe word and derogatory terms. Guests included Jim Norton and "Club Soda Kenny."

A final segment featured a discussion about Bobo and his viral videos featuring his dog, Mr. Malonegan.  Dan Soder was a guest, promoting his gigs.  A GoToMeeting commercial aired.  Jim Norton's solo segment followed, focusing on his sleep apnea struggles.  Callers addressed various issues: a husband whose wife refuses oral sex, a former porn star seeking dating advice, sleep apnea solutions (including marijuana), weight loss, relationship issues, infidelity, opiate addiction, and sleep apnea.  Norton offered advice. The segment ended abruptly, apologizing for lack of time.  A prior segment included callers with personal problems, focusing on an alcoholic caller, advising him to seek help. Other calls addressed relationship issues, erectile dysfunction, weight problems, chlamydia, suspected infidelity, opiate addiction, and sleep apnea. Jim Norton was a guest.

[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  What's up?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  Just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  It's going down, Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  This is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  We're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  Dick crisis.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies. 
[00:01:00]  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah!  Ah!  Morning!  Gotta adjust everything.  How great was Paul Anker yesterday?  I thought about it all day yesterday.  Tremendous.  Tremendous stories and really sweet guy.  He's really a nice man.  And completely there.  Yeah.  I would imagine he's not a big partier.  No.  I know a lot of guys that love to drink and party and he doesn't look like a guy that 
[00:02:00]  does that.  No, he's 71 and...  Still going strong, right?  Like talking to someone who's 30.  Yeah.  There's no difference.  He looks great.  He better send us that cologne.  I already emailed.  Huh?  I already emailed the email address.  They will.  Are you getting me one?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, good.  Because he did smell good.  I didn't want to say that because we say that a lot to our guests.  Yes.  I put the names of the people who were in the studio.  Myself.  Nice.  You and Tom Papa.  Very cool.  Yeah.  So the Paul Anka interview will be on the worst of the week countdown, I'm sure. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  We should promote that.  When is that worst of the week countdown on?  All over the place?  All weekend long?  Yeah, all weekend and on Indy.  Oh, are we doing that Indy thing?  Yeah, Sundays at 11 a.m.  So it's going to be on Indy?  It'll be on this channel and on Indy.  How do you know?  Because I'm sure it's going to be on Indy.  We play the top four bits of the week.  Oh, wow.  I'm sure it'll make top four.  Are we getting a buzz from the Indy thing?  What?  Not really.  I haven't heard one thing about it. 
[00:03:00]  I haven't had one tweet about it.  I've gotten tweets from the Indy Twitter account.  Yeah.  Ooh!  But that's only got like, you know.  All right.  How many people follow the Indy?  That's a big buzz.  You want to see?  Yeah, it sure is.  I do.  I'm sure it's a good account.  Who wouldn't follow them?  Indy on Twitter.  Let's see how well they do.  This is the...  What?  You know what the problem with Indy is?  Yeah.  I'll explain to you.  And this is the same thing we said.  When you type Indy SiriusXM into Google, SiriusXMU comes up. 
[00:03:30]  Today's top Indy rock.  When you can pick any name for a channel, you probably should pick a name that's not really  being used a lot.  Right.  So you could be the exclusive owner of that name.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's just silly.  It's just silly.  Yeah, I mean...  But you got that coveted Sunday morning spot, which is cool.  And they have...  They told me it's a good spot.  I didn't even know what to say to that one. 
[00:04:00]  It's not a good spot as we slowly head into football season.  What?  They're good about tweeting it out to all their followers.  All right.  Good.  They have 361 followers.  Hey, you know what?  Wait, but they have a channel.  If they all retweet...  Every five minutes, they could say what they are on Twitter.  They do.  And they get 300.  Half our listeners have more followers than a whole channel here at SiriusXM.  361.  Really?  Followers, so...  I caught the elusive radio wizard in one of my pictures yesterday. 
[00:04:30]  I didn't get mine sent to me, but I heard that his head popped up in one.  Yeah, I was just doing a quick Paul Anka as he was talking type picture, and everyone's  like, hey, who's the bald guy in the background?  And I go, oh, that's the elusive radio wizard.  It's like getting a picture of the Loch Ness Monster.  Yes.  There he is.  It's the same, too.  There he is in the background.  There he is.  There he is. 
[00:05:00]  No cup of coffee.  No cup of coffee.  Even more elusive.  That's right.  This is a rarity.  He usually walks around with that cup of coffee, because he's just hanging out, man.  I'm one of the guys.  Just walking around, making sure everything's okay.  Casual morning, fellas.  That's right.  Casual.  Just feeling the vibe of the show.  Hey, what are you up to?  Hey, just don't tell the bosses.  Right.  You are the bosses.  You are the bosses.  How bad do you want to throw a hot cup of coffee on that pressed shirt of his?  That collared pressed on middle management shirt of his. 
[00:05:30]  Badly.  Almost as bad as I want to throw a steaming pot of ragu sauce, because it would be really  hot and red.  Just the first shirt I found this morning.  Good morning.  That's right.  It's all good.  Anyway, just enjoying my cup of coffee.  Yeah.  I went to the Islanders last night.  My fucking hockey team is going to make the playoffs, it looks like.  And I brought my young son to a hockey game.  Man, that was a mistake.  Why? 
[00:06:00]  Well, after about 15 minutes, he didn't really give a fuck he was at a hockey game.  Of course not.  And then I'm stuck kind of entertaining him as I'm trying to watch some hockey.  I should have left him home.  Is it his first sports game?  No, he's been to a couple of hockey games.  But I guess we beat the Flyers.  I didn't really see much of the game.  Why?  What were you doing?  Oh, my God.  Trying to make sure he didn't give me any throat punches as he was telling me he wants  to go home.  Then he was gouging my brother's eyes out. 
[00:06:30]  How far into the game did he start saying he wants to go home?  Halfway through the first period.  Oh, Jesus.  I left halfway through the third period when it was still a really good game.  But I finally had enough of that.  He was throwing throat punches while he was asking to try to go home?  Yeah.  He knows how to hit you in the throat.  I would love to know where he learned that one from.  He's got those short arms so he just punches up and lands right in the throat.  Although he knows that it's really bothersome to hit somebody in the throat.  He understands that.  And he goes with the throat.  Especially when he gets mad and realizes Dad's not listening to him. 
[00:07:00]  So that's how he gets your attention?  Yeah.  It's an effective technique.  Yeah, it's very effective.  I mean, there's something brutal about it.  But if someone's not listening, we all do want to just punch him in the throat.  Yeah.  It really hurts.  I can tell you.  He's not even three yet.  And it really hurts.  So what's the strategy?  Because you know, obviously, it's halfway through the first period.  Dude, you so understand why people smack their kids.  Yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  I'm not going to be one of those guys.  But man, you so understand. 
[00:07:30]  Is the temptation over there?  Oh, God, yeah.  And what you're just sitting there going...  I mean, if...  And you'd be lying if you said the temptation's not there if you're a parent.  Oh, God, yeah.  And you're just sitting there going like,  what can I do to fix this situation that is not hitting him?  Because the only thing that's coming into your head is why I could hit him.  I could hit him harder.  No, the hitting would just make him, you know, hit me harder with his throat punches.  You know you got the guarantee ice cream.  Okay. 
[00:08:00]  But you got to break that out.  You know, you know you only got one shot at the ice cream.  Well, I was going to say...  So the ice cream got me through the second period.  But isn't the timing, like, dangerous?  Because once the ice cream is done, then he's got the sugar in it.  That's what I'm saying.  You know you got that in your back pocket.  Right.  You can always go to the ice cream.  But if you go to ice cream first period, he's done with it the beginning of the second period,  and he's nuts and wanting to go home.  Yeah.  I thought popcorn would get me through the second period,  and then I would go ice cream third period.  But he didn't want popcorn, so I'm like, ah, fuck. 
[00:08:30]  What was he saying?  I want to go?  Oh, yeah.  The whole time?  Yeah.  He lets you know he's ready to go home?  Yeah, because there's nothing interesting there.  Wait, so he said it, like, what were the words he used?  I want to go home, or I want to leave now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  All that.  Exactly.  I want to go home.  Simple as that.  And what did you say?  A lot more fun to go?  Oh, yeah.  I tried to distract him.  We tried to distract him with all sorts of stuff.  But he wasn't being...  He just wanted to go home.  No, he clapped when they announced the military guys.  They always announced a military guy at a sporting event.  He clapped that. 
[00:09:00]  He was excited about that.  A little patriot.  I took him to the circus.  You know, there's lights and all sorts of distractions there, but a hockey game, not so much.  At 44, I wouldn't watch a hockey game.  I wonder what he sees when he looks at hockey.  Because, I mean, a circus is a circus.  You got the tigers.  You got the elephants.  You got the poodles and the guys on stilts.  I'm explaining a circus to everybody, but you understand there's so many different little things.  So when you're bored with the elephants, there's always something right around the corner that's going to keep them going.  And there's other kids there, and they're all screaming and yelling.  At a hockey game, you just see... 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, and you can't really see the puck, especially if you're almost three.  It was just a dumb idea.  And the goal siren goes off maybe three times a game, four times?  Yeah, he was giving himself earmuffs most of the game.  He was.  I can only imagine that the horn that they sound after a goal has to be the worst thing for young ears.  So he didn't enjoy himself at all?  Not really, no.  No.  Were you annoyed when he kept saying he wanted to go home? 
[00:10:00]  Nah, I wasn't sure.  I wasn't sure.  It was a bad idea.  I took him last year, but he was so much younger that he was just there.  How long of a ride was it from the hockey stadium to your house?  No, when I left, it was two hours.  It's a half-hour ride.  You went all the way out to Long Island?  I started at 4.30 in the afternoon.  I had to go all the way across Manhattan.  At 4.30?  Yeah, well, the game starts at 7.00.  Ugh.  So what are you going to do?  You can't leave earlier than that.  That's just dumb because now you're just sitting in a parking lot. 
[00:10:30]  What time did you get there?  About 6.15.  Almost two hours.  Almost two hours.  And then, you know, I realized after a half-hour he was done.  I'm like, oh, this was smart.  Because he sat in the car.  That's why he sat in the car last time.  He slept the whole way.  Oh, he did.  The bum?  Yeah, but then he's well-rested and ready to start-  The bum slept the whole way.  He didn't even keep me company.  Now he's ready to start throwing throat punches.  Yes!  He's all over-rested up.  Yes!  He's ready to go for a run-around.  What are you going to do? 
[00:11:00]  Knocking T-balls into television sets.  He did that, yes.  Yes.  So how was your night, Jimmy?  Mine was so-so.  Mine was fairly uneventful.  Yeah?  I did Tom Papa's radio show.  Oh, how was that?  Village Underground was very crowded.  It was fun.  He's never going to invite me again, is he?  Why?  Because he invited me and I swear to you, I blew him off by accident.  I had my dates wrong.  I'm sure.  And I haven't got the invite again.  Did he ask you to go on it?  Since?  Yeah.  No.  But he was asked you to go on it, didn't he? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, I was officially scheduled.  And then I got my dates wrong and I fucked up.  And then I apologized profusely.  Yeah, I'm sure he'll-  I hope so.  Sounds like a cool little thing to do.  Yeah, it is fun.  There's a-  You know, it's a nice live audience and you go up there and you're reading off-  It's like old school radio.  Right.  And it airs, I don't-  It's Tuesday?  Mm-hmm.  No, we taped it last night.  I'm not sure what it airs.  Just looking for Come to Papa live.  Do you do fully work and all that?  They have like a few buttons.  Oh, they do?  Oh, they do? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And-  Old school sound effects?  Yeah.  Well, just like the stuff we use.  Wow.  I thought they went old school.  No.  Thunder.  The big metal sheet?  Yes.  None of that shit.  No.  Okay.  They don't-  There's not enough room on the stage because there's a band and then there's Tom and you  know, his wife is there helping out and she gets his characters and it's fun.  Nice.  Hey, I'm in the elevator with Kenny this morning and he said Bob Kelly had eye surgery?  What the fuck's going on?  Yeah, I don't know exactly. 
[00:12:30]  He had something wrong with this and he had to go up in the Bronx or something.  He had eye surgery in the Bronx?  No, maybe his- I mean, he obviously had a good doctor.  Oh.  Um, yeah, I forget what it was about.  You don't know?  No.  I thought you would know.  No.  I don't want anyone touching my eyes.  No, but sometimes you have to.  Yeah, but what happened?  Oh my God, he's got a Vine video?  I'm stoned right now.  Wait, start it over.  Everything was good.  My eye is good. 
[00:13:00]  I'm so stoned right now.  Ah.  Everything was good.  My eye is good.  I'm so stoned right now.  Ah.  Boy, that Vine is amazing, isn't it?  You're just jealous that you can't do Vine.  I'm not really sure if I'm jealous.  I know it's not, you know, available for the Samsung yet, but-  Vines are fun.  I have Vine.  I don't really use it.  I don't know.  I'm gonna do this thing with lemons.  I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it yet.  What are you gonna do?  Squeeze them.  I'm gonna do it with oranges. 
[00:13:30]  With oranges?  Yeah.  And you just squeeze them?  Yeah.  I would watch your Vine videos.  I should actually steal Will Sasso's thing and squeeze oranges, because he's 11 at the  end of every video or something.  Right.  Oh, that's his thing?  Yeah.  So is that- Bobby is, you know, he's an addict.  He's clean and all.  Yeah, he had surgery though.  For surgery-  So how does that work?  I never understood that with you guys.  Well, you know, for years ago-  But I mean, my point is how do you like just blow it off in your own brain like, okay, 
[00:14:00]  you know, I had to have something because I had surgery.  Because you know what your motives are.  Like, the difference is if you're- usually if people relapse, from what I've seen, and  they start drinking again and high again, usually you don't have one sip and then all  of a sudden your whole life is ruined again.  Mm-hmm.  You just don't know when it's gonna happen.  It will happen, but you don't know when.  It might be a week, it might be a year, it might be two weeks.  So when you do something like surgery, if I have to take med- I've taken fucking pills 
[00:14:30]  for fucking surgery to recover from sinus surgery.  I took like Vicodin or whatever they get- I'm not a martyr.  Right.  You have to check your motives constantly.  Like, you take- I personally take less than the recommended dosage and I stop before  I'm supposed to stop.  This way I usually will throw a couple of the pills out.  Right.  I never save them, I never hold-  And that's the same with this.  You're stoned, but the option is that you're awake while they're slicing through your eye.  No kidding.  No, I get all that.  But I mean, you know all this in your mind.  Yeah.  Like, this is what you understand. 
[00:15:00]  So the fact that you feel high, some guys will look at it like, hey, I got one for free.  Mm-hmm.  But you have to be really, really careful after that and not find an excuse to do something  else.  Yeah.  That could be the thing that, you know, turns somebody, obviously.  Sure.  Yeah.  Although, usually, you know, if somebody goes out and does something, there's a lot of lead-up  to it.  Mm-hmm.  They say like a, you know, when they say a drink or whatever is the end of a relapse,  not the start of one.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, because like you've started relapsing before then.  Your attitude has changed or you're not doing certain things and the final straw is that 
[00:15:30]  you fucking get high or you drink.  Okay.  Yeah, because someone like Ron Bennington, when he went through his surgery last year,  he didn't really, he didn't really take anything.  Yeah, Ron's one.  Because it scared the shit out of him.  Ron's one of those guys, man.  He's just a, I guess he can, I can't do that.  Like...  What do you have again?  Appendix surgery?  Yeah, his appendix.  Yeah, they took his appendix out and...  Apparently, yeah, he took no pain pills afterwards.  See, I can't, for him, for me, pain pills were never a thing.  Like, I can, believe me, I can understand the attraction to them, but on the rare occasions 
[00:16:00]  I've had to take them, I've just been ultra careful and I've talked to people, you know...  No pain pills after they take your appendix out.  Yeah, I can't do that.  I can't do that.  So you wake up from the surgery and that is it.  Holy fuck.  But I would assume that for a lot of addicts that would be the most dangerous thing is  the fact that, okay, now you have a thing of pain pills in your house, you're responsible  It's not like a doctor administering, you know, whatever it is, knocking you out.  Yeah.  It's like, now you're responsible. 
[00:16:30]  Here are the pills.  You get high on them.  Some guys just don't want to feel it again.  Like, Ron just may not want to feel that again because he's afraid just...  Even though if he got...  Like, he might go, okay, I'll do the pain pills and I'll do them responsibly and then  throw out the remainder.  But he might be afraid if feeling that high again will trigger something.  Yeah, of course.  Wow.  That's just amazing though.  It's very scary and it's one of those weird things to navigate that when it comes up  and medication is needed, you've got to make sure your motives are pure.  Like, you can't try to fucking go, well, like, you know, we bullshit ourselves about 
[00:17:00]  stuff and we bullshit girlfriends.  You justify it.  You justify it.  You justify it also.  Like, hey, you know, my eye still hurts.  I'm not saying Bobby's doing that, but he's the example today.  You know, gotta refill this prescription.  It still hurts a little.  Yeah.  The doctor gave it to me.  The doctor wouldn't have given it to me.  I don't trust doctors' knowledge of that stuff.  Like, they know medically what it is, but I've...  Like, my therapist is not an addict.  Like, she's a very smart woman, but she doesn't...  She recommended something, like, I won't take certain mood stuff. 
[00:17:30]  I just don't want to take it.  Um, but I take Sammy.  It's like one of those weird fucking herbs that's supposed to promote good moods, but  it's totally...  Bullshit, obviously.  Over the counter.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Sorry.  It's hilarious.  It's coming from me, too.  Um, but yeah.  Although, meditation has chilled me the fuck out, so...  It's one of those things, but she recommended something.  Wait, in all honesty, did you ever feel anything from that stuff?  Uh, it helps a little bit, like, but she recommended. 
[00:18:00]  She said, well, try the...  It might have an Adderall or something, and I'm like, I don't think I can take that.  So I asked Dr. Steve, and he goes, no, that's a trigger for a lot of people, and I'm like,  okay.  I just wasn't familiar with it.  So I didn't take it.  But she meant well when she suggested it, but a lot of doctors and fucking therapists,  they don't understand that certain things are triggers, because they're not, you know,  that's just not what they, I guess, what they specialize in or whatever.  So you always gotta double check it with somebody.  No, it's creepy.  Um, CVS called me the other day to, you know, ask if I wanted some of my prescriptions. 
[00:18:30]  Me too.  Now, uh, in my case, it's all allergy medicine.  We're heading into allergy season, so I have, you know, the Claritin, I have a nasal spray,  and I have a little something for night.  So I'm, you know, that's pretty much no big deal, right?  But I'm thinking CVS does this with everybody, because they're in business to keep the pills  flowing.  Yep, they call me too.  So they're probably calling people with other prescriptions that they obviously don't need  anymore. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, maybe.  It has to be for every prescription out there.  If you have a refill for, I don't know, Vicodin or something, CVS is gonna call you and  go, hey, you want us to refill this Vicodin prescription?  I don't know.  You know what?  Well, this is what I'm wondering.  Or do they have some kind of policy where it's more low-level stuff, I guess?  I bet it's for things that are, like, continual.  Like, Claritin, well, Claritin's not even a prescription anymore.  But, uh...  Yeah, the one I get is.  No, you can probably buy it off the over-the-counter. 
[00:19:30]  Unless you have Claritin D and Claritin are all over-the-counter now.  So what the fuck are they reflowing my Claritin?  I'm thinking of Allegra.  No, it's Allegra.  Yeah, that one I get.  Over-the-counter.  And Claritin too, I think.  There might be one Claritin that's still prescription.  I think that, yeah, there's probably...  But stuff like Vicodin, you know, like, if I'm on, uh...  When I was on one of my...  I was on Nexium, say.  Hmm.  And that's just a continuous thing for acid reflux.  Do you take that all year?  That's one that you're gonna continue.  But Vicodin or fuckin' some pain medication or Valium,  no one's on a fuckin' just a forever Valium thing, 
[00:20:00]  so they probably don't call for narcotics and stuff.  Right, but you know when it says, you know, you got three refills,  but you don't need it after the first one.  That's where I'm wondering.  Oh, sure.  That's what I'm talking about.  Where obviously you decided, because you didn't go and refill your Vicodin  or whatever Valium prescription or Xanax.  Right.  But they're now calling, because officially you do have two more.  I'm wondering if that shit goes down.  I don't know.  I bet they do.  If you have a certain number of refills and you haven't refilled them.  Right.  I bet they try to get you to buy them. 
[00:20:30]  It was just creepy to get the phone call.  That's the first time that happened.  Like, oh, we could see some subscriptions here.  We want to see if you want them refilled.  Because they're in business like anybody else.  I mean, they used to not even have commercials for prescriptions.  Right.  Like, that's a new-ish thing.  Right.  So it's just competition now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you know when I had my sinus operated on,  and I had to, for a week I had to sleep sitting up in my living room.  Jesus.  How do you do that?  Well, I can't even sleep laying down, so it was no big deal.  But I mean, they operated on my sinuses. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I think I didn't have to, but for me it would have been easier.  And I was on pain medicine.  And, again, I took three quarters instead of a whole,  and every eight hours instead of every six hours,  and then every 12 hours.  I really weaned myself quickly.  But I was grateful that something was helping me sleep,  because I'm such a terrible sleeper just to sit there.  You know, it's like I wish I could take fucking Ambien and stuff like that,  but I can't.  Because, first of all, it doesn't work forever.  The people always tell me, why don't you try this?  And it's like, I just can't do it.  I can't fucking do it.  No, I tried one of those natural sleep aids, 
[00:21:30]  and instead of Ambien,  and it made me sweat my fucking balls off.  Valerian I take sometimes, but then I'm...  I think that's what it was.  The Valerian root, right?  Yeah, it didn't hurt me.  It made me sweat horribly,  where I thought I had something seriously wrong with me.  Turns out, you know, I'm allergic to pretty much all trees and all grass.  So, those type of herbs don't help me.  It helped me.  And melatonin, excuse me for yawning,  I went to bed at Levitt's up last night.  So fucking tired.  Melatonin will help for a day or two. 
[00:22:00]  Like, it will help me sleep, and it's natural,  but then, like, it's ineffective.  Right.  For two days.  Yeah.  Hence the addict part, you know?  Like, I just...  Your body builds a very quick immunity.  I think Michael Jackson had it all figured out.  A nice propofol drip.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Just hook it in.  Whatever you need.  Just replace the bed.  How do you feel rested if it shuts off your brain,  and even though your body's been, you know, out for eight hours,  your brain thinks you've been out for half a second.  So how do you feel, you know, rested after that?  Is that what propofol does? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  When I got scoped for my acid reflux, you know, they gave me propofol.  Me too.  That's fucked up.  It was better, though, than other stuff, because I didn't feel nauseous waking up.  Propofol's more expensive to get, but I think it's a better anesthesia.  It was just creepy to me how quickly, you know, they could kill you if they want to.  Oh, boy, yeah.  I mean, how is it that you could put the human body to sleep in less than a second? 
[00:23:00]  That's so fucked up.  How fucked up is that?  Yeah.  I remember the doctor going, well, enjoy your sleep, and next thing you know, I'm in a recovery  room.  How fucked up is that?  And they just turn a little knob, and you're out within half a second.  I have no tolerance.  I remember when I went and got my dick snipped, they were just like...  It's the worst one ever.  They put me out, though, and they were like, this is just a little appetizer to just start  things, and then we'll give you the actual anesthetic, and then you'll be unconscious. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  I didn't even make it to the anesthetic.  The appetizer that knocked you out?  Done.  I didn't remember a thing.  Next thing, I'm opening my eyes, and it's woozy on the other side.  I'm still very, very upset with your mom.  Why?  About that.  Why?  Taking care of you a lot earlier.  Well, I mean...  But she wanted to be the one that, you know, took care of you.  She liked the extra skin.  Yeah.  She liked to have it.  Yeah.  She didn't want to...  She wanted to be the one that, you know, took care of you.  Well, she didn't do it.  I didn't say she did anything sick.  I'm just saying she was fully aware, but she was like, no, I gotta keep Sammy under my 
[00:24:00]  wing.  I went to a doctor to get it done.  Eventually, when you were 25.  19.  25.  Same thing.  I was 19, and it was good.  19 is 25, if you think about it.  Anything past puberty, it doesn't matter what age it was done at.  That's sick.  True.  My balls had hair on them.  You got a big hairy dick with problems, and you finally get it taken care of when you're  19.  Right.  Better late than never, huh?  I've looked at my kid's dick. 
[00:24:30]  If there was something wrong with it, we would be taking care of it now, not when he  was 19.  There was nothing wrong with it.  Well, his mother loved that it was natural and a part of Sam.  Right.  Because she saves the hair.  She didn't want to get rid of any of Sam.  Sam.  What was it?  A tiny pee hole?  I forget.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve says it's phimosis.  Phimosis.  What does that mean?  Yeah.  It's when you have a little...  Most pee holes are tiny.  The host is with phimosis.  No, a pee hole in your foreskin is tiny.  So your foreskin can't...  Oh, that's right.  He had that weird... 
[00:25:00]  He had the foreskin with no real fucking separation, right?  It's awful.  I couldn't...  Yeah, you couldn't...  You couldn't pull it down like a fucking...  Exactly.  Were you shocked when you first saw your cock head for the first time?  Well, I was because it was all swollen and bruised.  Must have looked like an alien to you.  Well, I mean, I'd seen dicks before, you know?  Oh, you have.  Of course you have.  Oh, have you, Sam?  Yes, yes.  You want to talk about that a little bit today?  So was Jess happy you did this or before Jess?  This was before Jess.  Oh, okay.  Now she's happy I did it.  She's happy that that was the result. 
[00:25:30]  My wife is a pharmacy tech.  It's illegal for them to push narcotics like that.  All right, so they're calling you for some of the more basic shit, right?  Yeah.  All right.  I was wondering about that because that was kind of creepy to me.  Speaking of rehab, gotta love David Letterman.  Lindsay Lohan was on last night.  I was wondering how he was going to handle it.  And he was kind of dicky to her.  I love it.  He was kind of dicky to her.  It's just cranky.  It's funny.  He was a little dicky, but getting his jokes in.  Good.  Yeah, good is right. 
[00:26:00]  Absolutely.  Fuck her.  This broad gets away with murder.  It's amazing what she's been able to get away with.  Yeah.  Why?  Does she just blow everybody?  I don't know how she...  I don't know.  She gets away with more shit than other celebrities.  A lot more.  She has to just be fucking offering blow jobs or something.  Some of the judges are female, aren't they?  All right.  Well...  Maybe she's, you know...  I don't know what the fuck's going on, but, you know, most of us would be in jail by now  for the same shit.  It's very strange because she keeps... 
[00:26:30]  This is like...  It's really strange.  How many times has she been to rehab?  I don't even know.  She lost track a long time ago.  She doesn't show up to court half the time.  Right.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to be late to court if you're a regular Joe.  What the hell do I know?  I just couldn't name a regular Joe angle.  And I was like, fuck, I just named one of his characters.  No, no, no, no.  I was just thinking, like, where do you...  No, I just...  You can't be late for court. 
[00:27:00]  You can't be late for the job.  You gotta be there on time.  Am I right or wrong, Sam?  What the hell do I know?  I don't know what you know.  Joe.  So we got a couple clips from David Letterman.  Yeah, you put on Mr. Fancy Letterman.  I'm in bed.  I gotta get up early.  You shouldn't open this can of worms.  I'm tired.  It's gonna go on all day.  What the hell do I know?  That's why I paused because I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  Hey, Mars, where's Jupiter?  Look at him over there.  What the hell do I know?  Get back to work.  Mars is very excited because the Knicks are on a fucking tear.  They're on a tear.  How the fuck did this happen?  Yo, they're doing great, man. 
[00:27:30]  They've won 13 in a row.  And Carmelo Anthony, a guy I don't like because I've always felt like he was just a ball hog  and not a great team player, especially in the NBA, is just lighting it up.  Lighting it up.  He's the NBA leading scorer right now, you know.  Yes, he is, by a fraction of a point or something like that.  Yeah, but he is officially number one in the league right now.  And so is his jersey.  Really?  The sales of his jersey.  What the fuck has changed with this guy?  He decided to be a team player?  That's right. 
[00:28:00]  He's playing defense.  He's playing both ends.  He's telling the guys, like yesterday, he told them to just go out and massacre these guys.  Let's get it going and get that division title.  And they did for the first time in, I think, 19 years.  That is correct.  I believe the last time the Knicks won a division title was 94.  That's unbelievable.  That is.  They're bad.  They're awesome.  I don't want to like them.  Why not?  Because I was a Jeremy Lin guy.  You got Kenyon Martin.  You got Chandler.  Well, Kenyon went down with a little injury yesterday. 
[00:28:30]  Is he going to be all right?  Yeah, it's a sore ankle.  Do you think we got a chance?  See, I'm saying we now because...  You're back in.  Yeah, they're doing really well.  Do you think they got a shot against the Heat?  If they don't fall apart, I think so.  You do?  Mm-hmm.  And how's the white boy doing behind the three-point line?  Novak, he hit a couple last night.  He cracks me up because he runs back and forth within a 10-foot area.  Yeah.  He grabbed some rebounds yesterday.  He goes, I'm going to run over here.  Okay, I can't get the ball, so now I'm going to run back to my left over here. 
[00:29:00]  He stays in the exact same spot the entire game.  Isn't he the number one three-point shooter?  He probably is.  I think so.  He probably is.  I don't know.  I haven't watched a lot of games.  I'll be honest with you.  But I guess I've got to start watching now.  Well, you've got to start going and taking people with you, like engineers.  I don't get Knicks tickets.  Friends.  I went to one game last year, the Jeremy Lin game.  Yeah, and you took this motherfucker with you.  It was a fun game.  Yeah.  It did take Sam.  Yeah.  Jeremy Lin.  I got to see my boy.  Wait, no.  Carmelo didn't play that game. 
[00:29:30]  No, he did not.  He was injured.  Would he remember you, Carmelo?  No, he didn't.  I never met him.  Mars, we weren't friends yet.  Or I would have...  Oh, that's right.  We're still not friends.  Ouch.  Yeah, why don't you just call him next time you want to go to a game?  I can't.  For a second, I thought we were friends.  I forgot.  Yeah, no.  Why can't you just call him?  I don't have his number.  You don't have Opie's number?  No.  No, I do not.  We're going on...  What is it?  9 or 10?  Do you have Jimmy's number?  Yes, I do.  Do you have Anthony's number?  Yes, I do.  Ouch.  Oh, this is really awkward.  Why don't you have my number? 
[00:30:00]  Because he'll use it.  Yeah.  You know?  Are you going to give it to him?  No.  I'm very private.  That's my regret in life.  I don't have more friends.  Really?  Yeah.  You got friends.  Yeah, I have a good solid three.  That's all you needed.  How many friends do you want?  Not many more than that, Sam.  I was once told you can count your good friends on one hand.  Yep.  But I was told that by somebody with very few friends.  Yeah, that's probably right.  Lindsay Lohan on David Letterman.  Now, aren't you supposed to be in rehab now? 
[00:30:30]  Do you not watch anything that goes on on your tabloid now?  I do.  May 2nd.  I was under the...  May 2nd?  Yes.  And how long will you be in rehab?  Three months.  How many times have you been in rehab?  Several.  And what...  How will this time be different?  What are they rehabbing, first of all?  What is on their list?  What are they going to work on when you walk through the door?  This is when I love Letterman, by the way. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, me too.  There's no one better when he gets into this type of, you know, mood or whatever.  Yeah.  He's great.  And he doesn't let it go.  Is he just talking to someone who obviously irritates the shit out of him?  Yeah.  Like Paris or...  Yeah, he is so irritated right now.  But he's obviously going to kind of keep it light and fun.  But you can tell he fucking hates this broad.  Yeah.  Well, he knows there's no purpose to having her on the show unless, you know, he's asking  her questions she doesn't want to answer.  Right.  And so he doesn't give a fuck.  And what is she promoting Scary Movie 5? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Is it 5 they're up to?  5.  Is that going to be alright?  I tapped out of the scary movies a while ago.  I don't know.  They're really trying to pump it up.  Mike Tyson's in it.  So...  ...work on when you walk through the door.  We didn't discuss this in the pre-interview.  No.  But it'll be 3 months and...  Ew!  Pause!  What happened?  Unless she's just trying to be funny.  We didn't talk about this in the pre-interview.  Or maybe she's just joking.  I don't know. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, she's just trying to joke.  Trying to release some tension.  Yeah, she's trying to, you know, joke about the fact that she's probably a coke whore.  Yeah, how about you fucking answer the question, you no personality zilch.  It's a typical actor.  You're in a pre-interview.  We didn't discuss this.  Just fucking answer it.  To be honest, I'm the happiest when I'm working and the healthiest.  And I think this is an opportunity for me to, you know, focus on what I love in life.  And I don't think it's a bad thing.  I think it's a blessing.  To be able to, yeah, perhaps a life saver.  Not a curse.  A career saving. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Now, do you have addiction problems?  Now you sound like Dr. Phil.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Is it like alcohol?  Do you drink too much?  We've discussed this in the past.  Did we really?  When did we discuss this?  Well, because we had...  I'm the one who's having the blackouts.  What is that saying?  I'm just saying.  I ought to be in rehab for the love of God.  What is wrong with me?  Fucking Letterman.  You ruled today, man.  Good for him.  Yeah.  And you can hear she's getting annoyed.  You're all over TV.  You know, falling down, bruised up, fucked up, fucked up.  Yeah.  And you can hear she's getting annoyed.  You're all over TV, you know, falling down, bruised up, fucked up. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ruised up, fucked up, being late, swollen eyes.  That's why I hate actors.  That's what you hate about actors and stuff.  Right.  It's that fucking...  And she's annoyed.  Really?  No one's really talking about your projects as much as they're talking about, you know,  that you're a big time, over the top partier.  Yeah.  What project?  She's got like one scene in this movie and that's it. 
[00:33:30]  She was hammered under a DJ table the last we saw her in Brazil, I think it was, right?  Yeah.  And they said she was kind of hiding from her fans or something, but she obviously looked very fucked  up.  What is Letterman supposed to talk about?  Scary Movie 5?  Get the fuck out of here.  Tell us about your character.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Letterman would not let it go.  Good.  Lindsay, let's show him a clip of the film.  This opens Friday, a scary movie.  You have to be in rehab May 2nd.  Are you going to be there?  You'll be there, right? 
[00:34:00]  Who's taking you to rehab?  You don't want to talk about that either, right?  Oh, God.  Jimmy Fallon.  Jimmy Fallon.  And you.  Jimmy and I will drive her to rehab.  And Tina Fey and Lor Michaels.  And so when you come out, you'll-  No, but I don't want people to think that I'm making a joke of that.  No, you shouldn't make a joke of that.  No, you shouldn't make a joke of that.  I'm not.  Because this could be good for you.  It will be good for you.  Yeah, it will.  Yeah.  Have you been to this place? 
[00:34:30]  No, it's not like a joking matter.  No, but I mean-  Shut up.  It is a joking matter.  She's so fucking hateable.  It is a joking matter, Lindsay Lohan, because you're fucking making a joke.  Right, she made a joke out of it.  But she's never-  No, her behavior makes it a joke.  That's what I mean.  She's never taken it seriously.  She's never taken it seriously.  Yeah, right?  She's gotten so many fucking chances.  Yeah.  And she's blown all of them.  No one gets chances like her.  No.  She made it a joking matter.  It's a joke.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, by the way she's behaved publicly.  Getting accused of stealing jewelry.  Just acting like a fucking dumb cunt.  It's like one-  You know, you have a job like that, and you're just gonna run around like a twat.  They give you a nice dress to wear somewhere, and you cut it up like a spoiled cunt.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Her family is shitty, too.  I almost feel bad for her sometimes.  Like, I wanna hate her, but then you look at her family, and her fucking father's just shit.  Just shit.  Mm.  So it's like, you know, she's not-  She's kinda young, and you know, she's-  It's like with a shitty family, it's kinda hard to- 
[00:35:30]  Right.  But after a certain age, you just gotta stop being a douchebag.  Yeah, then it's up to you, eventually, right?  It's just a problem.  She's getting less and less young.  You know what I mean?  Now she's becoming a person that you can just be like-  She looks way older than her age.  She looks 40.  Yeah.  Hey, relax with that.  Well, it's okay to look 40 if, you know, you're 40.  Oh, alright.  You know, then you look distinguished, like a gentleman.  Okay, I understand.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Have you been to this place?  No.  It's not like a joking matter.  No. 
[00:36:00]  But I mean, what in life can't we make light of, honestly?  Really?  We're all-  You're a good sport.  That's why I want to walk out with a tag on.  And you're a good sport.  Yeah, I mean, we never thought we'd see you again, honestly.  You know?  Because of the jokes and stuff, but yet, you have enough spine, enough sense of yourself,  enough poise to come out here and talk to me.  Letterman hates her, but he doesn't want to be perceived as like an older guy beating 
[00:36:30]  up a young girl.  So, he kind of backed off a little bit there.  Right.  Because he wants-  You know, he wants-  If she cries, he doesn't want it to be like, because she's being bullied.  Right.  Of course.  You know what I mean?  He can't be perceived as that.  He can't be in a little bit.  Yeah, he's walking a tightrope right now.  We're all your friends.  Oh, he wants to go all in.  You can tell.  Of course.  By the way, are we getting Bubba Watson crying?  Speaking of crying-  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll get it.  Please get that.  Yep.  And then, finally, this.  Lindsay Lohan on Letterman.  All right, all right. 
[00:37:00]  That's enough.  Oh, I thought this was going to be vodka.  Oh!  You've got to stop drinking.  They don't let you drink in rehab, do they?  It was a joke.  I know.  I mean.  I wish you'd come out with the tags on your dress, though.  I know.  It would have been so funny.  Yeah.  We'll do that-  It's not funny because-  Do that on Fallon.  It's hurtful towards me. 
[00:37:30]  No, I love seeing you.  I love seeing you, honestly.  I do.  And I saw-  Stop.  Oh, she's tearing up a little bit.  God bless you.  I love you too.  There you go.  Let's take a look at the clip now.  What is this going to be?  I believe this is the scene from Scary Movie when I'm with Charlie in the bedroom.  Mm-hmm.  And he sees something that scares him.  You see something that scares him.  Yeah, he actually saw what happens in the scene.  I haven't seen it yet.  But, um-  Oh, thanks.  Make that obvious and all. 
[00:38:00]  Um, but, no.  He sees something in the scene and there-  There's-  There's a lot of things that happen in the scene.  Sorry, I'm flustered right now because you made me tear up because you were very sweet.  I'm sorry.  Um, whatever.  Just watch the clip.  Take a look at the clip.  Whatever.  Roll it.  So, she was tearing up?  Yeah, she was tearing up and he passed her a tissue.  Well, good luck to her.  I mean, hopefully she'll get it.  Who gets court-ordered rehab but you could go like 90 days later or whatever the fuck 
[00:38:30]  it's gonna be?  I don't know.  Who gets-  45 days later?  What is it?  Well over a month later?  Who gets that deal?  Any-  Any other person.  Rich people, Marset.  Yes, sir.  Yeah?  Yep.  Aw, shit.  Any other person would be in prison?  Yep.  Be in jail?  Yep.  Yes.  Yes.  Anyway.  Good for Letterman.  Yeah, you could tell.  I enjoy watching him kind of reel her back in. 
[00:39:00]  Like, he's obviously talking to her with disdain.  Mm-hmm.  And he reels her back in enough that at the end she's like, I'm crying cause you're sweet.  Right.  He's like, what are you talking about?  He's been busting your balls the whole time.  Well, she was being sarcastic there, obviously.  I don't know.  She was-  No, she was being sarcastic.  Like, I'm crying cause you're so sweet.  I watched it and she did not have sarcasm in her face.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't-  It's just annoying cause of the way she handles stuff.  It's not even the trouble she gets in.  It's the way she-  She's such a spoiled brat. 
[00:39:30]  Mm-hmm.  That's what's annoying.  Yeah.  Speaking of spoiled brats and people that are annoying, is Kim Kardashian the worst looking  pregnant woman ever?  Oh, God.  Mars says yes.  Yeah.  Mars has a lot of opinions today.  What do you got on this, Mars?  Well, you know, Kim was always-  Every day they got a picture of her in the paper being pregnant and man, I-  I've said it over the years, there's something about a woman being pregnant that gets me  going.  Not her.  Not her at all. 
[00:40:00]  She looks like a whale, man.  She is just not handling this well at all.  Do you see the size of her titties, man?  Are they huge?  They're fucking huge.  But it's also like-  The butt is still way up in the air cause she's got implants or something.  She's wearing the least flattering clothes imaginable.  Right.  Like, she's still just trying to stretch out her old outfits.  He's absolutely right.  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, you can't wear that shit.  You gotta wear like, you know-  Maternity clothes.  Maternity clothes.  Maternity clothes.  Did you see the MC Hammer get up she had on the other day?  No.  Oh, Mars, man. 
[00:40:30]  You're not in then.  She wore some kind of MC Hammer big pants.  It was really really-  There you go.  All the way to the right.  All the way to the right.  Oh, God.  There you go.  There you go.  Let's see.  But yeah, she's got to wear like, normal person maternity clothes and realize that she's  not a model right now.  I don't think she's the type of person that'll bounce back.  And that's when-  And Kanye West seems so fucking shallow that this fucking relationship is doomed. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, she's got a lot of that sort of like, natural thickness.  Right.  That is only going-  I mean, that be-  Thickness becomes fat very easily.  Yeah.  You know?  And I don't think their relationship is based on any real deep shit.  Well, I don't-  It's extremely shallow stuff.  I don't know if they're-  As human beings-  I think Kanye West is the type of guy that would break up with a chick cause she's got  a pimple on her ass.  Yeah.  He seems like that type of guy, so.  There's a lot of rumors about what type of guy Kanye West is. 
[00:41:30]  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yes.  That could only mean one thing.  That's right.  Really?  Yeah.  And she's too stupid to know that.  Of course.  I mean-  What kind of guy is he?  Well, you know.  Homosexual rumors.  About Kanye?  Oh, yeah.  I never heard that.  In a long time.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Rumors.  Is that from Who Kid who just says shit?  No.  Who Kid?  Who Kid makes up nonsense.  Who Kid makes up nonsense.  And then you repeat his shit?  No. 
[00:42:00]  Who Kid makes up nonsense all the time.  According to Who Kid, every rapper is gay.  Right.  At some point he's accused all rappers of being gay.  Right, right.  Yes.  Although he made me laugh yesterday with his tweet.  How did he find Sal playing basketball in Brooklyn?  He called me.  Right.  And he said-  Our own Sal was playing basketball and Who Kid took a picture of him getting his ass kicked.  He said, he goes, I got a video of it too.  Oh, he does?  He's gonna come in on Thursday.  How bad is Sal at basketball?  He said, Sal was playing basketball with some black kids who looked like they were in high 
[00:42:30]  school and he was getting his ass kicked.  You play basketball with black kids?  I was getting-  That's such a hipster thing to do, man.  Black high school kids.  Black high school kids?  Yeah, they were definitely in high school.  I was getting my ass handed to me.  Oh.  What are you doing?  So bad.  It's not fucking fun, Sam.  Ooh.  You don't play basketball with high school kids?  It's weird.  Well, it's a pick up game, Sam.  It's not a fucking draft that goes on.  I just wanted to have some fun with my friend and that was it.  We went to go play some basketball.  I can't beat him up for that.  With high school kids?  Yeah, I can. 
[00:43:00]  Bunch of black high school kids.  Yeah.  Just happy they're not fucking piping him over the head on the fucking two train.  But that's how a pick up game goes.  You just go there.  You show up in a court and then-  You show up and you say, who's got next?  And that's it.  Right.  It's not like you go-  Did you bring a team or you had to like jump on someone else's team?  No.  No.  It was just me and my friend were like, oh, let's go shoot some boots.  You know none of them wanted you on the team.  Oh, absolutely not.  I mean, this kid was, the kid who was like, I was guarding.  He was like 19 and he was maybe five inches shorter than me and he was destroying me.  Really?  Absolutely. 
[00:43:30]  Just beating me to the hoop every time.  And you think you're good at basketball?  No, I'm horrible.  But you just like playing it?  Yeah, it was just fun.  I just wanted to, you know, it was a beautiful day out and like, why not have some fun?  All right.  But who kid, how did who kid get involved with this?  It was so funny.  I turn around all of a sudden I see who kid and he quickly like turns his back to me and  like, you know, he just like starts staring off into, you know, the Hudson or whatever.  And he's with this like really hot milf.  So I go, I was like, oh, I got it.  Sal.  You heard it, right?  Yes.  What?  It doesn't sound, it doesn't sound legitimate when you say it. 
[00:44:00]  Okay.  There's a couple of things he did wrong there.  Yeah.  A, saying milf like it's fucking 1997.  B, saying really hot, not convincingly.  And C, saying that on the air.  You're right.  Why, why did you say milf?  And why on the air?  Because she was definitely older and she was beautiful.  Did she have a kid?  Um, no.  She didn't have a kid.  So how do you know she was a milf? 
[00:44:30]  Well, I mean, she was a much older lady.  You never say that on the air, though, because you don't know what his situation is.  Oh.  I mean, who kid has confessed a million times.  That's true.  That's true.  And he posts shit of him.  He does come on the air.  Yeah.  And I go, but who kid, you're married.  And he goes, yeah, but I cheat.  Yeah.  He openly says it.  He's shown me videos of him banging models like on his phone.  So it's totally cool.  Actual banging?  Yeah.  He's got a lot of videos on his phone.  Oh my god, really?  Yeah.  So then I walk over to who kid, and he's like, hey, what's up, Sal? 
[00:45:00]  I said, he goes, oh yeah, I posted a few photos of you online.  I'm like, oh, fuck, this is terrible.  Yeah, he called me and said he was trying to get Sal on the spy cam.  Yo, kid!  Got Sal on the spy cam.  Yeah, so it was just love who kid.  Is it who or who?  Who?  Who kid?  Who kid?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he did say.  He did say you were terrible.  Oh, I am beyond terrible.  Yeah.  And you're a huge Knicks fan as well.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Thank God we don't talk about the Knicks anymore. 
[00:45:30]  You just say hi.  I love that.  You got the hint?  Yeah, I just love that you just say hi to me anymore, and that's it.  Ouch.  I love that you don't try to do the fucking basketball small talk with me anymore.  Does that hurt?  No, I mean, Ope told me that he didn't want to do it, so I stopped doing it.  It's that simple.  I took an order.  I mean, that would hurt me.  No, it doesn't hurt.  It's a casual conversation.  In all fairness though, it's like, when we get in here in the morning, we're under the  gun.  So I can't have small talk about the Knicks when I'm trying to get through three or four 
[00:46:00]  newspapers quickly.  Yeah.  Just to make sure there's nothing out there that, you know, we're going to miss.  We've spoken in the morning.  You'll speak to Mars in the morning.  It would hurt.  I mean, it would hurt me.  If you were like, specifically you cannot talk to me about anything but hello.  Mm.  It would hurt.  Well, we'll get there eventually.  It's fine.  We'll get there eventually.  You closer now than you used to be?  No, not really.  Yeah.  Wow.  Sal doesn't have much heat.  No, he doesn't.  His episode of The Elevator Show was the worst one.  Oh, man.  No, it wasn't the worst one. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, yeah, it was.  Numbers-wise, you're saying.  Yeah, yeah.  When I check my numbers.  That's what counts.  Yep.  The Miz is looking good.  Troy and The Miz did really well.  And then you got Sal playing drums.  Not so much.  Well, how many views is the one that I did?  About 30,000 views.  Okay.  The others are averaging about 40 or 50.  Oh.  You can't produce numbers for the Opster.  No.  What purpose do you serve?  Absolutely.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  I taped Chip on the way home yesterday. 
[00:47:00]  I haven't really promoted it yet.  There's a video that I just put up on my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  It's Chip Meets the Bird People.  You're looking at 29,000 for Sal.  Yeah.  45,000 for Troy and The Miz.  Yeah.  What is this?  Even you got 42,000 for a guy who can't peel an orange.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, a guy with no fingernails.  I'll beat you out, Sal.  By a lot.  By a lot.  43,000 for Have a Hulk face.  By a lot.  Oh, man.  But anyway, Chip Meets the Bird People, I think, is already doing well. 
[00:47:30]  I put it up after the Islanders game last night.  Did you edit some of that stuff out?  No, I kept it all in there.  Sorry, Chip.  Oh.  It's more of a visual, really, because we were waiting for Kenny, and all of a sudden  these bird people came walking down the sidewalk.  They're protesting something.  I didn't even understand what they were protesting.  Genocide or something.  I don't know.  Yeah, some silly stuff.  Yeah.  Bunch of birds. 
[00:48:00]  And then Chip was trying to get them to converse with him.  And he was obsessed with the birds, because they're walking with these sticks with birds  on top of them.  Fake birds on them?  Yeah.  So...  I think it's more of a visual, but people are definitely digging the video so far.  Where am I?  I'm not in this video.  Where am I?  Good pause.  For thousands of years the...  This is a sign that we did get on video. 
[00:48:30]  For thousands of years the Lakata lived under...  How does it...  It's folded up.  Matriarchal.  Welcome back Lakata.  Matriarchal rule.  On their traditional lands.  What does that mean?  And then who killed them?  And they're pissed off at Obama, and they're going to the UN.  I didn't understand, because I did try to talk to these people.  So they're walking down the sidewalk playing their drums with these birds on sticks. 
[00:49:00]  Alright, hit it again.  What's up with the birds?  You guys all walking together?  What are they doing, mister?  It's a march of Lakota people who are marching to the UN to talk about genocide, American genocide.  Why is there so many birds?  Sure. 
[00:49:30]  It's like, what are they...  What are they all, like, flying or something?  Double wings, cocksucker.  To put something interesting to look at.  Oh!  Hope the birds don't crap all over the place.  My mother would always say,  Chip, the birds will go to the bathroom on you.  I hope you're in.  How come they all got birds with them?  That don't make no sense.  Careful, don't hit the birds.  You're bird brains.  Get that, they're a bunch of bird brains.  Wait, put it on me. 
[00:50:00]  You have to edit this first.  I'm going to pretend I just noticed it.  Look at those fucking bird brains.  That's good, just use it like that.  It'll look like I just made it up.  We'll try it again, though.  I don't think I got it.  Look at those fucking bird brains out there.  What the fuck?  Fucking cocksuckers.  That's horrible.  Fucking good.  What a phony Chip is, though.  Why?  He needs multiple takes.  He just wants people to think it's all spontaneous.  I guess I was supposed to edit that. 
[00:50:30]  Just have the reaction shot.  But I fucked it up.  I fucked it up in post.  So he could look surprised.  He's just obsessed with the birds and the bird people.  Well, when he gets a good line, he wants to make sure that delivery is on point.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Yeah, he does.  The YouTube channel is Opie Radio.  It's the latest video.  Chip meets the bird people.  We should take a break.  There was something I wanted to get into.  I forgot.  I figured out during the break.  Dan Soder's here.  Dan Soder's joining us today.  We haven't seen him in a while.  That'll be good. 
[00:51:00]  And Jimmy's at Caroline's.  Oh, I knew.  Tomorrow through Sunday.  Yeah, I offered tickets to my dentist.  I hope you don't mind.  It's my dentist, too.  It's fine.  I got my hummus tooth finally fixed officially.  The temporary's out.  Oh, really?  I got the permanent in.  Man, that crown shit is pretty cool.  You know he's going to gym.  The old days, a crown looked like a crown, right?  I mean, meaning it was so obvious he had some shit done.  Probably, yeah.  I can't even tell.  Now I'm going to have to floss before every show, in case the dentist is there. 
[00:51:30]  Hi.  We were talking, and all of a sudden he goes, you know who I got to see?  We were talking about comics, and he goes, I got to see Jim Norton.  And then, of course, blabbermouthed.  I go, where did you say Caroline's?  I think I could get you tickets.  I just panicked.  He probably knew.  You think he knew?  Of course he did.  Because my doorman said to me, so when are you working in the area again?  I want to see you.  Really?  This is the first time he asked me in seven years I'm living here?  The week I'm in Caroline's?  Right.  I'm like, I'll put you on the list.  But I don't know why I couldn't keep my mouth shut.  That's fair.  And I'm getting shit done, so you'd think it would be easy to not talk. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  But right away I panicked.  You said Caroline's?  I could get you tickets.  That's fair.  I mean, I would have done the same thing.  Making it sound like I'm more important than I am, that I got this inside fucking track  to things.  What do you do?  You know who's going to see Jim at Caroline's this weekend?  I don't know.  My mom and dad.  Really?  Are they?  You better have a good show, man.  Right up front.  That's where you want them, huh?  Yep.  Right up front.  Very opinionated.  You better have a good show.  I know.  The Roberts are a very tough crowd.  They're a very tough crowd.  There'll be no complimentary tickets given out.  Right. 
[00:52:30]  Everything will be charged to their card.  Yeah.  They're going to go, he didn't have any jokes about Sam.  Yeah.  Do you think he'll mention you?  Yeah.  Why won't he mention Sam?  Yeah.  That's where my mom should be sitting there waiting for the Sam material.  Yes.  But positive stuff about how good Sam is.  Like, boy, and then Sam does something, the rest of us are left in the dirt.  He's all here, like, one laughter.  Finally, the Sam material.  Yeah.  That's why we paid our...  Paid.  They're going for free, right?  I don't know. 
[00:53:00]  No, they're not.  There's no complimentary tickets for the Roberts.  Okay.  Because the dentist is getting in free.  That's right.  The dentist gets them.  And then, like, instead of saying, I could get you two, I panic.  How many do you want?  And then, of course, they're going to say, like, four, because they want to bring another  couple.  I'm like, all right.  And then next thing you know, I'm texting Kenny while I have Novocaine mouth.  Absolutely.  I need four tickets for my dentist.  And I walk out of there going, all I had to do was shut my fucking mouth.  I wouldn't be involved with this.  This is Dr. Zell from the marathon, man. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  No, I don't care.  I'm glad.  Soder's working one night with me.  There's a couple of different people working.  Really?  Yeah, Soder's on one night.  Friday, Saturday.  Oh, Friday, Saturday?  Friday and Saturday.  And who else is there for the...  Fuck, that's great.  Yeah.  I mean, you always have good openers, but I'm a fan of Dan's.  So you get to see Dan Soder and Jim Norton.  That's going to be really strong.  Christy Stefano, Thursday and Sunday.  Okay.  Oh, he's funny. 
[00:54:00]  Who?  I thought there was another person.  Christy Stefano.  Is he?  Oh.  I don't know.  Oh, I know.  I had to veto a couple of people on the list.  Yeah?  They always give it to you.  Like, yeah.  Is this person okay?  Is that person okay?  Oh, a list of people you don't want before you.  I love saying no.  I wish I knew they were.  Oh, we're going to find out after these messages.  Well, no, not after these messages, because we're not going to tell the people.  Yeah, probably during these messages.  During these messages, we're not going to get to find out.  We're going to get to find out.  That's right. 
[00:54:30]  I can't wait to find out.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  He's here.  He's here.  He's here.  He's here.  He's here.  He's here.  He's here.  Exactly right.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Why the Stray Cats today?  Let me think. 
[00:55:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Man, you got me on this one, you rock.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  You want to feel old, though.  The sixth sense kid is 25 today.  I finally don't have to feel guilty jerking off to him.  He's 25. 
[00:55:30]  Are you kidding?  I would have accepted 18.  That's the sixth sense kid.  He's got a hairy chest.  He's got more hair on his chest than I do.  He's losing his hair, it looks like.  He looks horrendous.  What has he been up to?  He was it for, what, two movies?  What else was he in?  I don't know.  He's just been getting a fat jaw lately, I guess.  Yeah, they threw him in a couple other movies because of the sixth sense thing,  but nothing else really, really hit for the kid. 
[00:56:00]  He's probably still waiting for Bruce Willis to call,  like they'll do some cop buddy thing.  He's probably still hanging on, man.  He's fucking finished.  He was a cute kid, not so much as a 25-year-old man.  No, he looks like he's in a Creed cover band.  He's got an old arena rock face.  It's bad to be bloated and have a small mouth.  It's bad to be bloated!  Dan Soder in studio.  And this worked out nice.  I didn't know you guys were working together this weekend, which is cool. 
[00:56:30]  Jimmy headlining Caroline's and asked Dan Soder to do a few of the shows.  Yeah, I'm excited.  Hosting.  That's going to be great.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100 for tickets.  Yeah, I'm hosting Friday and Saturday.  Let me see.  Uh-huh.  Uh-oh.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  I was like, what happened?  Am I not doing it?  What were we talking about just before the mics went on?  Because that was good shit we should have saved for the fucking show.  I hate when that happens.  That's why you guys got to wait outside the fucking studio. 
[00:57:00]  Just wait in your pants.  Yeah, you burn out all the good stuff while some dumb commercial's on.  It's going to be like a major league where I'm like, hit?  God.  You're a wrestling guy.  Yeah.  Watch WrestleMania.  I know you guys were there.  Yeah, me and Jimmy went.  Yeah.  Before we start here, you know, half our fans like when we talk wrestling.  The other half fucking despise it.  So I never know what to do.  I didn't bring it up this time.  But I'm all obsessed with Fandango to the point we got him in here.  We got him in here.  What is it? 
[00:57:30]  I was obsessed.  He tweeted me.  And then it built from there.  And then next thing you know, Sam surprised us with Fandango last week.  And we got a lot of heat.  I don't.  We got a lot of heat, man.  The clip went everywhere.  We made Raw.  We made fucking.  WWE.com.  Really?  WWE.com.  We made the WrestleMania post shit that went out there.  Yep.  I don't get it.  What?  You don't get it?  I just don't get it.  The fans are all in.  To me, he's a modern day disco inferno. 
[00:58:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I just don't.  I think this guy.  I think it has a shelf life, too.  Because, you know, he beats Chris Jericho at WrestleMania.  He had no business being at WrestleMania.  It was a brand new character that just took off where they were like, fuck, we got to do  something at WrestleMania.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah.  No one gets heat that quickly.  The one thing about that match that was bothering me was, you know, Jericho's got that broken  sternum.  He had that broken sternum.  Does he still have it?  I don't know, but his chest looked. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, you can see it.  He's got like this gap.  He's got like his pecs.  How did he break his sternum?  Because I cracked my sternum once when I was living in Rochester playing basketball.  I took an elbow, and it was just a crack, and it was excruciating.  You felt every breath for about two straight weeks.  Yeah, he looked like.  Before it started sort of healing.  It looked like it like.  But his broke?  Yeah, where his pecs are, they just like.  Yeah, I saw that his chest looked a little weird.  How did he break it?  I don't know.  No one knows how he broke his sternum?  I don't know.  Was it a wrestling thing that went wrong?  I would imagine.  Was that you oiling up Fandango? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  The best part.  Jimmy was an eager boy that day, and Fandango, off air, wanted to make it perfectly clear  to everybody that he's a man.  Oh, well, yeah.  And a man's man.  Basically saying, guys, don't even think twice.  I like pussy.  He sat in that chair outside the studio.  I like Jim's hands vigorously rubbing it.  But when I try to, here's the worst, what I got to do with his arms, watch the third  one when I miss.  Yeah, that's the WWE version.  I took a quick video. 
[00:59:30]  That's the best part.  Watch Eager Boy.  I want to see this one.  I missed his arms.  It's fucking humiliating.  Such a little fucking.  Fandango is like, look, it's a character.  Enough already.  But Jimmy was all in.  He wanted his arm lotion, so I'm trying to be helpful.  I'm trying to be helpful with his fucking arms.  Jimmy was all in.  Watch.  Come on.  Jimmy's oiling him down.  Watch.  You look like you were doing the don't go.  Who grabbed?  Please don't go.  Basically, Fandango moved away from Jimmy, but Jimmy was in mid, lotioning up. 
[01:00:00]  Here's my question.  That's what's got to suck about being a professional wrestler.  You're a good looking dude.  You're clearly in shape.  You're a high flyer.  And then Vince McMahon is like, we're going to call you Fandango.  Yeah, but he's got more heat than anyone else.  No one has had heat like this in a while, or as quickly as this.  But outside, he's like, yeah, my dad's a truck driver.  I'm from Maine.  He wanted us to know.  He got out of character so fast when these mics went off. 
[01:00:30]  A lot of these guys will stay in character the whole fucking time.  He breaks kayfabe the second the mics are off.  Fucking Borat never gave us the real guy.  Fandango, as soon as the mics were off, look, man, I like pussy, okay?  Let's all relax here.  I mean, I guess I just don't get the character.  It's hilarious.  And now they're doing it on the train on the way.  This is on a train after Raw. 
[01:01:00]  I like to watch those chants die down as they go to 110th Street, 125th Street.  Now it's changing in Harlem.  Young locals get on.  I mean, the whole arena was singing it.  They put out a video.  After Raw went off the air, everybody in the building kept singing the song  to the point where they just played his music to make everybody go home. 
[01:01:30]  Really?  That was the house music?  Yeah, they just put his music on as the house music.  I don't know what it is, but everyone is just all in with this thing.  All in.  You did a nice job lotioning him, Jim.  Yeah, I felt like he was very, very well-oiled by the time he left, as he needed to be.  His smooth skin.  Yeah, he was very pleasant.  Yeah, we liked WrestleMania.  People were still mad at us because they're like, you know how hot of a ticket that was?  And you guys actually left before Rock and Cena?  I'm like, yeah, man.  I had to go home and sleep.  Yeah.  In the middle of the Triple H Brock match. 
[01:02:00]  Well, because Jimmy wanted a sweatshirt.  Yeah, I want to buy a sweatshirt.  So we wanted to get a sweatshirt before we left.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But I left yesterday early.  I went to a hockey game, and it was still a good game.  It was the Islanders-Flyers 2-1 in the third.  I had to leave.  I brought my son.  But when I hit the parking lot, there were other people leaving, just trying to beat the traffic.  This WrestleMania, man, we left fucking Giants Stadium.  I call it Giants Stadium still.  We were the only people in the parking lot.  I'm not exaggerating.  No one else. 
[01:02:30]  Not one other person left early.  Why would they?  And we had a clear shot out of that lot.  My question is, do you think more people left during the beginning of the Cena-Rock match?  Like, you left during the Triple H Brock Lesnar match.  But it was, yeah, but I mean, it was close to Rock time.  I was watching.  No one was leaving because of the Rock, is my point.  And then me and Jimmy were laughing like idiots because we're seeing a packed stadium, a packed parking lot, and we're on the road by ourselves leaving. 
[01:03:00]  Everybody left at the same time.  I was sitting in one of the skyboxes so you could see the audience.  Right.  And it was full until the end of the show.  Everyone stayed.  Yes.  That's commitment.  Yes.  I don't know.  I mean, it's tough because there's no real announcing going on during WrestleMania for the fans in attendance.  That was a little strange.  Yeah, it's just weird.  You hear bell dong when they just start.  Yeah.  It's really weird.  Especially with wrestling because, you know, they fill in all the dead spots with the great announcing. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It was a little strange.  And they didn't seem to have a lot of ring announcements at all.  They did their usual ring announcements.  I didn't really hear many of them.  You've got to clear the cake out of your ears now.  It was cool.  It was cool to just check it out.  Yeah, you got to go to a WrestleMania.  Yeah.  Second one for me.  I went to Anaheim back in the day.  Yeah, we get it.  Now you're rubbing it in.  Now you're being a little much.  That's right.  I've never even been to a Raw.  You've never been to a wrestling show?  I've been to one.  It was a dark match.  91, Cow Palace. 
[01:04:00]  Why wouldn't you go?  Macho Man, Ultimate Warrior.  All right.  That's cool.  It's not cool.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  It is cool.  Not cool.  Thank you, Sam.  Yeah, I get it.  It was Kurt Henning versus Roddy Piper.  Mr. Perfect or Roddy Piper.  How is that not cool?  International.  I mean, international.  Because it's a dark show.  Who cares?  I mean, if the TV cameras aren't rolling, I'm not interested.  It was the first time I ever heard the word faggot.  Really?  Yeah.  Because Demolition was taking on the Bushwhackers, and this was when the villains were really 
[01:04:30]  villains and would yell mean shit to the crowd to get them hyped up, and Demolition was getting  in the ring.  And it was in San Francisco at the Cow Palace, and they took off their mask and Smash was  getting in the ring.  He's like, shut up, you faggots.  As I was close to the ring, and I went back to my dad, who's just getting shit-faced.  And I'm like, hey, what's a faggot?  And he goes, don't say that word out loud here.  Oh, really?  He's like, I'll tell you on the bus on the way back.  Oh, no kidding.  What year was that?  91.  Before everybody had bullshit cell phone cameras, because that clip would have been on TMZ. 
[01:05:00]  Wrestler calls the audience a derogatory...  Well, there was a time, you know, people just threw that word around.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Not really.  Not anymore.  Not really meaning sucking dick.  Yeah, just meant...  But I think he actually meant...  Stop being a faggot.  I think...  Oh, but he was really starting...  We're in San Francisco.  He really meant sucking dick.  Oh, he meant the whole thing.  Oh, boy.  Assless chaps.  Yeah.  Love of Cher.  Wow, okay.  He meant the whole...  I remember what you said on the way in. 
[01:05:30]  You're mad at who, Katie, because he has Lisa Ann on his show.  And Lisa Ann's a porn star.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's my favorite porn star.  Why is she your favorite?  I don't know.  Out of everyone to choose from.  I'm like a hipster.  Like, I was on to her before anyone else, before she got famous.  Oh, jeez.  Now I know why.  Holy fuck.  She played Sarah Palin.  That was her big breakout role.  Wait, who's that?  She played Sarah Palin on what?  On HBO?  No, Nailin Palin.  Nailin Palin.  Oh, I thought on HBO, and then her career took a turn. 
[01:06:00]  No.  She's a serious thespian.  Oh, I got confused.  That decided to give porn a whirl.  Yeah, I can see why she's your favorite one.  I can see why she's your favorite porn star.  Although the boobs are a little tight.  I know.  She's like the tight boobs.  Not just in this case.  Like, you know, some good breast implants are all right, but when they start getting tight  like that.  She has nice legs.  Yeah, she's just built like a brick shithouse.  When we used to have naked girls on our show, the girls would come in and they would look  amazing in sweaters.  Like, amazing. 
[01:06:30]  But then they would get naked and just have these basketballs that didn't move.  Looked like a sock with oranges in it.  I don't like her hairline.  Her hairline, she looks like the fucking kid from Sixth Sense all grown up.  Don't say that.  Don't ruin this for me, Jim.  Her fucking hairline is weird.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to be jerking off next time to her and I'm looking at her hairline.  That head shape.  Yeah.  It's a little rough, Dan.  That's a rough fucking move.  You're not going to talk me out of this.  She's pushing a five head.  You guys.  Down syndrome head.  Even when she puts the hair down.  Do you want some fruit? 
[01:07:00]  You can even tell when she's wearing bangs that they're starting a little high.  You know what?  You're not going to talk me out of this?  She's not even that good looking right there.  That's old school.  She has awful tits.  She's okay.  She has nice legs.  I would definitely have sex with her, but...  Yeah.  This is not going well.  You know what?  I don't care.  This is my...  It's like when you have someone listen to a band.  You're like, they suck.  And you're like, I still like them.  Fuck you, guys.  Yeah?  Well, you didn't know their first album.  You didn't see her on MILF's Like It Big back before she got all...  Still my favorite. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  That head is fucking hurting, though.  Look at that forehead.  You never noticed that forehead?  I didn't until now.  It's all you're going to see.  I know.  I'm going to be obsessing about it.  It is a big forehead.  But I have a big forehead.  What's her finishing move?  What's her specialty?  What is her thing?  She sees if you can come from the bridge of her nose to her hair.  If you can clear that forehead like fucking evil.  That's the snake river.  He's ruining it.  You're not ruining it for me.  Yes, he is.  I love it.  He's not going to ruin it.  He's ruining it. 
[01:08:00]  I'm going to stay with it.  Terrible.  I'm almost going to jerk off just on purpose.  I mean, out of purpose just to do this now.  But I always see...  I follow her on Twitter and she's like, meet with DJ Who Kid.  And I'm like, this son of a...  You know, he's hugging her.  She's in lingerie.  I mean...  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Really just...  When does Who Kid work?  He's in here on Saturdays.  He only does like once a week?  Yeah, he only has one show a week.  He's all day on Saturdays.  It's like seven hours long.  How many followers does she have?  Who Kid?  Oh, her.  Yeah.  Her?  She's got $447,000. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, she's popular.  She's a popular dance order.  I mean, but I'm saying, I was...  I'm pulling a hipster move.  I was on that before she got big.  Yeah.  She's very popular.  And now her forehead's going to...  It's not going to bother me.  I'm going to look past it.  She's pretty, I mean...  But just the head's a little...  A little too much?  Yeah, a little rough.  Yeah.  That's how seasoned Jim is.  That he looks at a forehead.  He's like...  I just noticed it.  Jim has a whole new trip. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, he's on some different level shit.  He was showing us...  What was it recently?  Hair.  He's into hair right now.  But I'm really not.  It's temporary.  It's just a temporary fix.  I saw a big, meaty pussy with hair all over it.  I just kind of liked it.  That's like your thing for right now, though?  Yeah, but even that's fading.  I just like the vagina.  It's fading fast.  Yeah, I just like the vagina under it.  It's not the hair.  I'm not a hair guy.  I can't be...  And her armpits are kind of hairy,  which would be sexy to smell, I imagine.  Like, I can kind of go for that. 
[01:09:30]  He could dig some hairy armpits.  If the chick is pretty, I can, yeah.  I can't do it with an ugly girl.  Or I can't do it if the girl has a sheen of sweat on her body  that creeps me out and it feels too masculine.  Like a woman who has a nice feminine body  but just has hair in her armpits could be sexy.  Wow, hairy arms are a major turnover.  Only under them.  I don't want hairy legs either.  That's rough.  I know hairy calves.  And hairy legs.  Hairy calves is just a gross sentence.  Yeah, hairy legs are even rougher, right?  Than hairy armpits.  Right. 
[01:10:00]  I would much rather take hairy armpits than hairy legs.  Yeah.  Yeah, me too.  It's just because, you know, you keep the arms...  You see those gals in Central Park.  Yeah.  You know, the hipsters, like the feminists,  they're like, no, man, this is how I'm going to walk around.  Just let our bodies grow.  There's something to be said for that.  Good for you, I guess, but fuck.  Yeah, she's not...  This woman's not pretty that you're showing, Sam.  She's awful.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a five o'clock shout out, too.  Oh.  Ew.  Look at the top wing.  Come on, which one?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  She's trying to lick her own hairy armpit.  Yeah.  Who gets turned on by that?  You'd be surprised.  I used to see this dominatrix years ago,  and she would come over,  and she would just fucking put her armpits in my face,  and I would just lick her pits and jerk off.  Where does that come from, you think?  It's just scent is very animal.  Yeah.  But again, if I have a chemical attraction to a girl,  it's very animal to like that.  It smells just fucking raw and dirty.  Can we ask Nicole real fast?  Yeah.  Sure. 
[01:11:00]  After you came, were you like,  why did I smell her pits?  No, I didn't, but I didn't want to do it again.  Yeah.  No, I never questioned after I...  I love how the other guys think that we want them.  No, they don't want you guys.  Look, look, he's just waiting,  hoping that I call him in too.  Is he pacing back and forth?  Yes!  Go get your stupid coffee.  We want Nicole.  Put up the one minute sign.  He can't.  He can't handle not coming in.  He'll pace back and forth until you...  I see that.  What's going on?  Jimmy likes hairy armpits every once in a while. 
[01:11:30]  No, it's not my thing.  I'm sorry.  You've never grown it out for a guy?  Do you ever not wear deodorant?  Not on purpose.  Yeah.  I mean, by accident, I've walked out and been like,  fuck.  Did you shower this morning?  I did.  I was hoping that Jimmy could smell your armpit.  I know.  I mean, you could smell it, but it's got deodorant in it.  Yeah, I mean, that's fine.  The hair wouldn't even be necessary,  as long as there's a good smell.  So you prefer it to be like a gross smell?  Not gross.  Like you look like VO?  You look like a musky?  Yeah, a little musky.  But it depends on the...  Again, it depends on the woman.  Some people, that's disgusting. 
[01:12:00]  Okay.  It's gross.  I kind of get it.  Yeah.  I kind of get it.  Kind of.  See, he doesn't fully get it.  I'm not like chubbing up thinking about a nice musky armpit.  That's where we fucking part company, my friend.  I got a three quarters going right now.  You might have to throw him off the show this weekend.  Do you like the musky?  Now I'm not working for not being your thing.  I'm like, I'm proving it to Jim.  Look, Jim, I'm getting a powder and I'm smelling her armpits.  You like the musky smell everywhere?  Yeah.  Wow.  It depends on the person, though.  It can be gross, but it can be very sexy.  Like between the legs and everything? 
[01:12:30]  I knew what you meant when you said everywhere.  I didn't think you meant the crook of the elbow.  I like squeezing my arms.  This is making me feel weird to ask you.  Behind the me?  Yeah.  How long after a woman showers does her pussy stay fresh?  Depends on nationality.  I would hope that it would be a long time.  No, I'm not.  Unless you're disgusting.  This is a real question.  How many hours do you think?  Some of them stink as the soap is washing out.  I don't know.  What's the shelf life of a nice smelling pussy after a shower?  You think you could last 24 hours?  I'm hoping it might not be the case. 
[01:13:00]  I'm praying.  I think you've got to take into effect weather, physical activity, and nationality.  I was going to say nationality.  She's riding a bike in New Orleans.  It's not going to be a fucking very long shelf life.  Down in the swamp.  What nationality would be bad?  I don't get a start.  I don't know.  I'll tell you off the air.  It was immediately in my head.  I had six.  I was like, do you want me to not say that?  Maybe not.  I'm hoping I'm good.  Rich is in the doorway of the control room. 
[01:13:30]  Why can't we just talk to Nicole?  Well, in case we need Rich, it's cool.  He's hanging out.  He's making sure.  He's a good guy.  Rich, get him on mic.  Yeah, Rich.  Rich, they need you.  In a second.  He's so excited.  In a second, though.  We just wanted Nicole.  I'm not fucking bothering you.  My choice is listen to you guys or walk to the kitchen with Stan.  You know what?  He's got a point.  I mean, which would you rather do?  We're talking about girls with hairy arms.  What do you have on that?  That is my biggest pet peeve, like stubbly armpits or anything. 
[01:14:00]  He gets really mad about it.  I have to do laser or wax.  Women, that's my biggest thing, man.  I don't know.  Yeah, I lasered down below, but I'm thinking about doing the armpits.  Would that upset you?  No, no, no.  As long as it gets smaller.  When you laser, it doesn't grow back at all.  It's never going to grow back again.  It does grow back, though.  Ever.  It can come back.  I know women have had it done where it comes back a little bit, but it's softer.  Oh, look at that.  It's softer.  It was so sensual.  What if the hairy bush comes back into style?  You're fucked.  That's what my husband said.  I know.  I know.  Did he want you to do it or no?  Yeah, he wanted it done.  But I mean, I didn't do it for him. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, I guess I did it for him.  Yeah, but plus it's cleaner.  But there was just one girl who had a giant vagina who I fucking saw online, and I was  like, oh my God.  So the hairy pussy I thought was very sexy because it was her.  Like, hair on some people.  If a girl has a tiny pussy and there's hair on it, like, whoa.  I don't even like them as friends.  You don't even want to know.  The lips are a bit?  What are you talking about?  Like a large vagina?  All right, I'll show you a picture.  Oh, no.  I want to see a picture.  He likes it to look like tiny penises.  No, no, no, no.  He kind of does.  He's not going to admit that. 
[01:15:00]  But it is.  The truth.  It's a little rough.  Like a big clip?  The clits are really big.  That really is.  Like it talks to you like a little, hey, hey, Jimmy.  No, like that.  What's going on?  Oh, God.  I wish I didn't see that for you now.  That's a throwback V.  Yeah, see?  What does that look like to you?  What does that look like?  I get it.  An animal.  An animal.  Sexual animal.  No, it's not a sexual animal to me.  I'm sorry.  You know what?  If you want, I won't shower tomorrow and let you smell my fits. 
[01:15:30]  You want me to do that?  No deodorant either.  Don't be a fucking goody gumdrops.  No deodorant on.  No shower.  No deodorant.  We'll see what you feel.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, Nicole.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, Rich, I guess.  Thank you, Rich.  Thanks, Rich, I guess.  He's over-modulating into the mic.  He's so excited.  The bottom line is now that she'll do that tomorrow, and I just want to tell her how terrible  she smells.  Please do.  Hopefully she'll go to meet with Greenstein.  The fucking pit's stinking.  That's your shamer.  Yeah.  Why do you smell?  You stink. 
[01:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  G.H.  Mm-hmm.  Can I say one thing in Rich Davis' defense?  Sure.  Is he mad now?  No.  Oh, good.  But he does a great show in the afternoons called Vino and Rich.  Mm-hmm.  They have the Dude Bro Nation.  The Dude Bro Nation.  Yeah.  Why is Sam laughing?  It's a great show.  What's the Dude Bro Nation?  What is the Dude Bro Nation?  What is the Dude Bro Nation?  Oh, you know, they talk about nussies.  What's a nussie?  Why is Sam covering his eyes?  What's a nussie? 
[01:16:30]  Sam usually loves uncomfortableness.  What's a nussie?  What's a nussie?  Tell him, Sam.  No, Kenny.  What's a nussie?  A broad.  Oh.  Hey, yo.  A broad?  What's a nussie?  I'm interested to find out.  I'm trying to guess what it is.  What's a nussie?  They got their own language.  That's good for T-shirts.  Yeah, for the Dude Bro's.  For the Dude Bro's.  They do sell T-shirts.  They have a lot of song parodies.  How does Kenny know everything that is happening around here?  That's creepy.  Wait a minute.  What is it?  Why would you say a nussie?  She's a pretty nussie?  I don't get it.  Is it like neck pussy? 
[01:17:00]  No.  What is it?  She's a hot nussie?  Sam, what's a nussie?  Yeah.  Is that a black hussy?  It's a good looking girl.  But why nussie?  I don't know.  What else do they do?  You would have to ask Covino and Rich or tune in from noon to four on Indie 104.  Oh, they're part of the Indie thing, right?  They get four hours on Indie.  It's Covino.  How come they get four hours and this show only gets two hours?  Well, because...  But they also get five days a week. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, but are they still doing it on the other channel or is that their whole show?  No, Indie...  Indie's their channel.  Their old channel became...  Oh, okay.  Forget I said that.  No, we're good.  Sunday mornings at 11 is perfect for us.  Well, at least it's a time set a lot of people are listening to.  Yeah.  Perfect.  I still want to know what a nussie is.  Sam, bring up Covino and Rich.com.  But I want to know what an actual nussie is.  Why nussie?  What's a dude bro nation?  Yeah, what is a dude bro nation?  Well, you know how ONA has the pests?  Right.  They have the dude bro nation.  Sounds like a lot of hair gel and date rape. 
[01:18:00]  They don't say dude bro.  What?  Sounds like a lot of Ed Hardy t-shirts.  Do they have promos that say dude bro nation?  If they don't say dude bro, then how do you explain their annual dude bro convention?  They have a dude bro convention.  Oh, no.  Oh, fuck.  And look at the cool pictures on their website.  Let me see.  Kenny.  Dude bro nation.  Where does it say that?  I don't see that.  They're dressed up like hair rock guys. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, they're just fucking around.  Yeah, that's all right.  There's no dude bro convention.  What's the video that they're pushing right now?  Where's that?  No, there is a video right on the front page.  Who's going to go to today?  The C&R store.  Yeah.  Well, they got panties.  Do the panties say Nussie?  Wait, what kind of panties do they sell?  Give me Nuss.  Oh, Hot Nuss.  Oh, Hot Nuss.  Dude bro.  Dude bro crew.  All right.  Yussel Hunter.  Oh, Nussie Hunter.  They got dad bros.  Yeah.  Wait.  They got a dad bro t-shirt. 
[01:19:00]  Dude bro crew?  What is the pussification of America?  They got one of those shirts.  Super handsome dude bro crew.  I don't understand.  It doesn't say that anymore.  They're pushing dude bro, but I don't understand.  I just don't understand that.  I don't even know what it is.  The people, like the guys.  I love Nussies.  They have a shirt that says, what's Swoot mean?  I would literally be more comfortable wearing a shirt that says, I fuck babies.  Happened dude bro or Nussie?  But what's Swoot?  Anything on the page. 
[01:19:30]  What's Swoot?  They have a lot of phrases.  Will you explain to me what Swoot means?  Instead of Swoot.  By the way, they're housing you on catchphrases.  They're killing me.  My new catchphrase is catching on though.  What is it?  So weet!  Like you know how you guys...  What's Team Spot mean?  What does Nussie Hunter mean?  Spot is their producer.  Oh, okay.  You know they don't say something's gay.  Look, Rich is probably playing a lot of music right now.  Can you get him in here?  They say YAG.  They call it a YAG? 
[01:20:00]  Like backwards.  Like you know how in hip-hop you...  Yeah.  That ish.  Why were you uncomfortable with Kenny talking about Covino and Rich?  Because I think Kenny was doing something where he brings up something that he says is good.  Right.  But he knows that you're not going to share that opinion.  Oh.  What are the last two shirts we can't see because you didn't scroll down?  All right.  Yank D's.  Oh, like they're balls.  You got it.  Oh, that's fun.  Jim, do you like that one?  I don't. 
[01:20:30]  They got a t-shirt called just Tickle Sack.  I like those guys.  I like those guys a lot.  All right.  They got their own trip going.  I don't know.  Dude bros.  Dude bros.  Dude bros.  Yes, Kenny.  He's busy talking on Hits 1 right now.  Yeah.  Will they come in to explain what a dude bro is and what a nussie is or a nussie?  I'm interested to find out.  A hot nuss.  Nussie.  And I want to know what swoop means.  Sam, are there any song parodies we can play?  Oh, oh, oh, oh my God. 
[01:21:00]  You see what's going on?  You see what's going on?  Kenny is doing a full sell.  We're going to have to jogtober.  Can we don't reach?  No.  They're good guys.  What do they got?  I want to stick it in your caboose.  All right.  You know, girl, every man's got a goal.  And it's to fill that hole.  No, no, not that.  The other one.  Well, I thought I might stray. 
[01:21:30]  Cause I've been tapping it the same way forever.  Caboose, caboose, caboose.  Between her butt cheeks.  I've been praying all day.  That this would make our love better.  Caboose, caboose, caboose.  It don't make me gay.  Bust out my demons inside. 
[01:22:00]  Want to conquer that hole.  Okay.  I can't hear it.  What happened to this?  I got to get the hook.  Is it the computer now?  Did you just fawns the computer?  So I want to put it in your caboose.  Tapping that ass from the back sets me loose.  I don't want children. 
[01:22:30]  I don't wear rubbers.  Caboose, my penis lingers.  Your booty hovers.  I'm about to stick it in your caboose.  You know what?  That's not bad.  Here's what the part I didn't like about it.  Is that they're saying caboose.  Caboose, caboose.  Because the punchline is saying,  I'm going to stick it in your caboose. 
[01:23:00]  But that's not bad.  I mean, at least it's dirty.  It's a commercial for hepatitis A.  You just can't be not wearing a rubber  if you have anal sex.  You're right.  You can get that from eating it, too,  from eating an ass.  I know.  I just like the matter of factly,  the way you said that.  Is hep A the easy one?  Yeah.  I think between that and C,  I think hep A is the easier one.  It's not a blood one, I don't think.  How do you get rid of the hep A?  Don't know.  Do not know.  I've never had it, luckily. 
[01:23:30]  Am I a Nussie?  I don't know what a Nussie is.  I'm really actually interested  to find out what a Nussie is.  You guys could take a lesson  from Covino and Rich.  At least they get to go to the Super Bowl.  All right.  Now you're rubbing it in.  He always calls him Covino.  Covino.  How do you spell his name?  C-O.  Covino.  Covino and Rich.  You know what Kenny does?  Can I tell you what Kenny does  in the mornings? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  When you go,  he's out in the hallway.  Yeah.  He always compliments Rich  on something that happened  on Covino and Rich.  Right.  But then tells him  Covino's not doing a great job.  It just tries to promote friction  between the two of them.  Because you were really funny.  But I don't know  what Covino's problem was yesterday.  Yeah.  Like the other day  they had a big discussion  about pole dancing,  how the girls do it  like as an exercise class. 
[01:24:30]  And Covino's all uptight.  He doesn't go for that.  No, why not?  He thinks it's too skanky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the ladies are doing that now.  Yeah.  Rich Davis, you know,  he's on the money.  He says it's all the rage.  But Covino, you know,  he's not in.  He's not in  with the pole dancing  as an exercise.  Yeah.  So you're more of a rich guy  than a...  I'll say.  Yeah.  I'll say.  I'll say.  Is he done talking  on Hits One?  Probably.  Yeah, we're kind of stalling now  because I need to know  what a Nussie is.  I'll say.  A Dude Bro.  But why Nussie?  I don't know. 
[01:25:00]  What else are the Dude Bro  is going to talk about  at the Dude Bro Convention?  Nussies.  Nussies, exactly right, Dan.  Do they have a Nussie booth?  I don't know.  No, the Dude Bro Convention  is more than just  like a convention hall.  It goes on over days.  You know, here's where  a Dude Bro Convention  goes on in a booth  with fucking holes drilled in  so you can see through  the next one.  No, it goes on  over the course of days  and they go to a baseball game  and they go bowling.  They do like guy things.  Now Rich is just lying to us  because they only talk for,  like, see,  Kenny's coming back.  They only talk for 30 seconds 
[01:25:30]  every like half hour.  There's no way  they're still talking.  I just got yelled at  by Ryan,  you know,  the weatherman  on Hits One.  Ryan got mad.  Yeah, the on-air light  wasn't on.  They didn't have  their headphones on  so it's reasonable  to believe  that they're on a break.  Right.  But they record  their phone calls  during breaks.  They don't take them live.  Well, you shouldn't  tell people that.  I didn't.  I'm telling you.  It's the magic of radio.  And I,  so I said, 
[01:26:00]  I barge the radio.  Yeah, you can't just  barge the radio.  You're spurring it.  The on-air light  wasn't on  and they didn't have  headphones on.  Which one is Ryan again?  The weatherman.  Oh.  He's the one  that you never remember?  I kind of don't.  And he thinks it's a bit.  Is it?  No,  I don't really know him.  I just know Nicole  and I know Rich  and Stanley.  Yeah,  no,  there's also Ryan.  I don't really know him.  What does he do?  He reads  The Weather,  which it's a national show  so that becomes  a very broad thing 
[01:26:30]  to talk about.  It's going to be sunny.  He's got to do more  than The Weather.  There's something moving.  Believe me,  that's his contribution.  Oh my God,  Kenny's just killing everyone.  But it does sound  like he listens.  Yeah.  I mean,  the one thing about Kenny  is you know the man  listens to Covino and Rich.  You know that he does.  He's a company man.  You know the big thing  on the mashup?  They talk about  Stanley's sack.  Oh really?  Yeah,  which is like their thing  like when they get mail  like a mail sack  but they do a whole big song 
[01:27:00]  live about Stanley's sack.  It's big.  It's black.  It's time to get  Stanley's sack.  What does that mean?  He probably has a big bag.  I bet you Stan's all bagged.  Black guys usually have big dicks  but I bet you Stan's  packing like fucking  five and three quarters  but he's all bagged.  With a big ball bag?  Yeah,  he's a big ball bag.  I'm all bagged.  I'm all bagged.  Right,  it's a little double entendre.  That way it's something  the kids can listen to  and be like,  oh time for the mail  to be read out of the sack  and the adults can go, 
[01:27:30]  oh,  those guys,  wait till these kids find out.  Yeah,  wait till these kids find out.  Kenny listens to disco  on the way in.  Sometimes.  And they belittle Nicole  on that show in the morning  because they have a segment  called  Nicole versus the streets.  He's like,  Nicole.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  They ask like questions  of Nicole,  like trivia questions  and then they like go  ask people on the street  and then the phone callers  guess like who's going  to get it right,  Nicole or the streets 
[01:28:00]  or nobody.  And they belittle Nicole.  I'm impressed.  Which isn't the right thing.  I'm impressed with how  well versed Kenny is  in all their bits.  Yeah,  he knows.  He knows.  But they also,  they literally like for the past  maybe five years,  each person on the show  has one bit for the week  and it's always the same thing.  So it's always the Stanley Sack  and the Ryan Weather  and the Nicole in the streets.  Yeah,  that'd be awesome.  They each do one thing per week.  Do your thing.  Do your thing. 
[01:28:30]  Nicole also gets the 411  where she spills the gossip.  Yeah,  I know that.  That one I know.  Spills the gossip.  She spills the beans  that was happening in Tinseltown.  Basically,  she goes on TMZ  and picks three of their stories  and just reads them.  Exactly.  The reporter.  Right.  So Rich is not going to come in?  I don't know.  Ryan really yelled at me.  We're not even really making fun.  I just want to know  what a dude bro is.  I want to know  what the dude bro convention is  and I want to know  what a Nussie is  and I want to know  what Swoot means. 
[01:29:00]  Swoot.  Swoot.  The morning mashups producer  Alex G's cat died last week  so they weren't morning.  I think I know  what Swoot is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's after you have your,  if you get your ass fucked,  you know like  if you,  if  after you wipe it out,  sometimes an hour later,  something will drip out of your ass  that you didn't get  and it's a combination  of common shit  and that's referred to as Swoot.  Oh my god.  That's what their shirt says.  Why would you walk around 
[01:29:30]  with a shirt then?  I don't know.  Why would I continue to do that  when I realized  it was bombing  one second day?  I just kept plowing ahead.  I don't think it bombed.  Yeah,  I don't think it did either.  I don't think it bombed.  I'm just imagining  someone explaining that shirt  after wearing that  if that was the actual definition.  I believe,  I'm getting some intel  that I'm about to be linked  to a vocabulary  Covino?  Yes,  that's correct.  Covino and Rich.  Oh really?  Web page.  Alright,  that's good news.  So then we can learn ourselves 
[01:30:00]  what a Nussie is.  Here we go.  Tell him we don't need Rich anymore  because we got the answers here.  They have a lot of terms.  Who cares?  What else are we doing?  Start from the top.  A whole dictionary.  What that mean?  Covino and Rich terminology.  Oh,  that's good.  They didn't even  just say  Covino and Rich terminology.  They have to have a little  what that mean.  Maybe that can turn  into a catchphrase too.  No,  they're very hip  and happening.  Oh.  What do you want to know  about Jimmy?  They used the word absolutely 
[01:30:30]  but isn't that just absolutely?  Oh no,  it's said in the Rocky Balboa voice.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Alright.  And it means a definite  absolutely is either  a definite yes  or no.  God,  these guys have  their own trip going on,  man.  What's action packed meaning?  Yeah,  but that's just the definition  of absolutely.  Like,  that's not like used.  Are these all things  from Covino and Rich?  Yeah.  Asked,  ripped,  arson shite.  Arson shite.  The original name  of the show. 
[01:31:00]  What's ass soup?  When there is a gaggle  of hot ass  in the room,  the atmosphere  begins to heat up  and you can almost  smell the party  begin to boil,  which simmers  into tasty ass soup.  Have your ass soup  eaten spoon ready  at all times.  Can you smell  the ass soup  in the air?  I guess that's  a good thing.  They're ripping off  the fucking dude book.  The bro guide?  The bro,  a brocabulary. 
[01:31:30]  It's just horrible.  They're ripping off  brocabulary.  I have booked,  how dare they?  I've booked Rich Davis  for two minutes from now.  All right,  very good.  What's BBC?  I mean,  certainly not the version  I know what that is.  Big Black Hawk.  Big Black Hawk  is what it is.  But what about  glistening cakes?  Well,  that's borrowed  from Bossip,  which is,  you know,  the black gossip website.  Yeah.  But popularized  by Covino,  Covino or?  Covino,  get it right.  Covino.  Covino and Rich  to describe big ass cheeks,  usually all wet 
[01:32:00]  and oiled up  as seen in rap videos.  What's ass ripped?  Can I interrupt you?  Sure can.  They had a big discussion  last week  about the triangle  like in between  a girl's legs.  Yeah.  Like,  you know,  you see the butt cheeks  and you see the thighs,  but some girls  have that little triangle.  Right.  And believe me,  that was a lot of controversy  about that  in the Dude Bro Nation.  I'm starting to think  that Kenny's a super fan.  He might be.  I think he knows 
[01:32:30]  more about them than us.  Yeah,  I'm also part of  the What You Want crew  on Hits One.  What's the  What You Want crew?  It's the crew of people  that think they're requesting  the songs that are played.  Oh.  Yeah.  What You Want.  Bacon strips,  a vagina that has  some extra skin.  They got boink  on this list.  Boink,  an expression used.  They got bromance,  bucket of justice.  But boink does not mean  have sex.  What does it mean?  Boink is an expression  used when situations  are really, really good.  It's a verbal exclamation. 
[01:33:00]  Also can be used  with a fist bump  to further the excitement.  They don't say this stuff.  Dan,  could you put your fist up  like this, please?  I will,  but I don't want to.  Okay,  like watch this.  This is the example.  I definitely hit that.  Boink.  Do I have to say it too?  Yo-yo.  Timmy's face is priceless.  Jim,  can I still work for you  this week?  I'm just speechless.  Boink me out.  We're only in the B's.  I won't do that.  You won't.  Why won't you boink, Sam?  Give him a boink.  Boink. 
[01:33:30]  Boink.  Sam.  He poked your boink.  I hit the Edgar fingernail.  Bucket of justice.  What's a bunk?  What is bromance  or bromantic?  Well, I know that.  Yeah.  What's bucket of justice?  The bucket from which  personal and obnoxious  questions are pulled  during interviews,  which disperses  mass amounts of justice.  All right, what else?  Butter space.  I mean, we're only in the B's.  Chicken cutlet.  Making sweet love  to a woman on a beach. 
[01:34:00]  Jazzing.  Jazzing on her?  Jazzing.  That's what probably  upset me the most  out of all of this.  I'm jazzing on her?  Wait.  Jazzing.  I think that's to ejaculate.  Why wouldn't they just say?  Jazzing.  It's a fucking,  you can talk,  you can say that.  Yeah.  Maybe that's a...  Especially if you're part  of the dude bro nation,  they'll accept that.  Hey, Dan.  Deez was looking for you.  Deez who?  Oh, Kenny.  He's nuts.  Oh, man.  I walked right into that one. 
[01:34:30]  Jazzing is really...  I'm not going to lie.  Jazzing just made me upset.  Yeah.  It's calling it jazz.  Is that what you do  when you watch  Lisa Ann movies?  I jazz on yourself?  I jazz all over  my hairy stomach.  We don't have to do  all these.  Dickie tug.  Dickie dive.  The dickie dive is...  But I want to know  what Nussie is.  That's got to be on the list.  And I also need to know  what sloot means.  I think you should wait  until he comes in here  to explain it.  Is he coming?  Is he jazzing? 
[01:35:00]  What's the hassle?  He's jazzing.  Hair don't.  A.K.A.  Hair doodoo.  A very bad hairdo.  Sammy J has a hair don't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay.  This is just a link  to a list of terms.  This is not part of their show.  No, this is from the...  No, this is the ones  they made up.  Kenny, what website is this?  Covino on rich.com.  Covino.  What's a Hasselhoff?  A major annoyance. 
[01:35:30]  Don't hassle the Hoff  or you'll put me  in a smood.  Why can't they just say a mood?  Why does it have to be smooth?  What's a smooth?  I don't know what a smooth is.  I'm watching Jim  just get more and more annoyed.  Weird little terms for stuff  like guy things.  Jim, you'll love who?  Hoo-hoo.  Oh.  Hoo-hoo is the female  genital region.  It's a cunt.  No, it's the hoo-hoo.  Like, don't jazz in her hoo-hoo  unless you want her  to get preggers.  Oh, preggers? 
[01:36:00]  Something like that.  All right, keep going.  Hokey pokey.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't jazz in her hoo-hoo.  I don't want to read  the definition of hokey pokey.  Oh, I do.  Dan should.  Dan Soder.  Well, I mean, of course,  it's when you're nailing a nuts  doggy steez  and you're about to jazz.  Oh, my God.  This is upsetting me.  She quickly turns herself around  accepting the money shot.  That's what it's all about.  Is this an SNL skit?  Or...  This is a joke.  This is not real. 
[01:36:30]  This is probably a joke.  Yeah, this can't be all...  They don't use this stuff.  Is this a joke, Kenny?  Kenny?  Kenny, do they ever discuss  nailing a nuts doggy steez  before you jazz?  One listen and you'll be hooked  to Covino and Rich.  I don't know.  Covino.  I don't even know  how to say his name properly now.  It's always be Covino.  I was going to think  that was Covino.  That one...  The interweb thing,  that's like...  Interweb.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Interweb is Covino's term 
[01:37:00]  for the internet.  Yeah, because no one's...  He started that.  No one's made a joke ever.  Like when Will Ferrell  played George W. Bush on SNL,  no one ever made that joke.  No, no.  Nobody says interweb.  He's coming in.  Oh, boy.  Should I hide this?  No.  No.  We're learning about the,  as Kenny calls it,  the Covino and Rich show.  What's the Dude Bro Nation?  We're very confused.  Oh, God.  It's the lame name  that our listeners  gave themselves  like seven years ago.  Rich, don't put yourself down.  It's not lame. 
[01:37:30]  It's not lame.  I love how Kenny does it.  I love how Kenny does it.  He's a super fan.  Trust me, he's a super fan.  He's bringing up  all sorts of bits  from a while ago.  And bits he did  basically yesterday.  And we're going through  the vocabulary here  or whatever.  Do you guys really use  Hokey Pokey?  No, it's probably something.  Anything we've said once  in joking passing  probably made it up  You tell me this, Rich.  Yeah, go ahead.  Is this the true definition  of Hokey Pokey?  When you're nailing  a nuss doggy steez  and you're about to jazz. 
[01:38:00]  I don't even know  who wrote these.  I'm not sure what that means.  It's on your website.  Yeah, but I think  I don't handle our website.  So I don't know  if that's a listener-based thing  or if Covino wrote this.  The Hokey Pokey, I think,  we said when you're  banging a girl doggy style  and then you turn around  or something  and come on her.  A lot of these  are from like years ago.  My one question is  is  Who are you, by the way?  Hi, I'm Dan.  Nice to meet you, Dan.  Nice to meet you, too.  Dan Stoner.  Very funny guy.  He's doing time  in front of Jim Norton  this weekend at Caroline.  Big fan.  About the jazz. 
[01:38:30]  Do you guys really call it jazzing?  Well, we called it jazzing  as  I guess you would say  just a play off of words.  Because originally  back in the day  when we first started  Why aren't you owning this?  It's on your website.  Own this shit.  I am owning it  in the beginning.  Push back.  Push back.  And defend hokey pokey.  Well, I'm not going to defend  the hokey pokey.  You've got to nail  the nuts doggy, Steve.  I don't want to jazz on her  from behind.  Well, I'll tell you what.  We said jazz because  in the beginning  we did Maxim Radio.  Right.  And they were like all 
[01:39:00]  they were like  yo, pull back a little bit  pull back a little bit.  Right.  Is it amazing  Maxim said that  like on an uncensored thing  like a guy's network?  Well, you had a  we remember from our  NAW days  you have to talk in code  so we certainly had  A lot of our original  stuff was code  even though we were  uncensored radio  uncensored radio  and you know  a lot of these things  are stuff because  I think they're more  clever than just  juicing  you know  What's a nussie?  What's a nuss?  A nussie is a new hussy.  That was just 
[01:39:30]  an old school thing  like a new  We should have  figured that one out  Dan!  A new naughty hussy.  I thought it meant  neck pussy.  Neck pussy.  I don't know.  Kenny just said  it was a broad.  A broad.  A broad.  Hussy and broad.  And do you sell  a lot of these t-shirts  because you have  a t-shirt that says  Swoot.  Swoot.  That's an old school  Covino thing  that's the opposite  of like sweet  with something that sucks  it's fucking swoot  like not sweet.  Do you sell a lot  of Swoot shirts?  I don't know  if that one sells  the best.  Which one sells 
[01:40:00]  the best?  Let's see  the dad bro one  sells a lot.  Okay.  You sell dad bro shirts?  Yeah.  When Covino had a baby  they did the play  off a dude bro  to dad bro.  So that one actually  sells a lot.  I saw some guy  wearing it at wrestling  the other night  in the audience.  Good for you.  So.  You know Rich also  does some stand up.  Yeah.  I did stand up  once a year.  Why only once a year?  I don't know.  He's the undertaker.  He's the best.  3-0 in Gotham.  That's what I do. 
[01:40:30]  Only once a year?  It seems like  if you like it  why don't you  give it a shot?  I don't know man.  Jimmy will tell you.  I mean Jimmy's the best.  I know why.  In the beginning  it's it.  Why Kenny?  He's got a hot wife.  That's why.  He spends time with her.  Yes.  I can't do stand up.  I'm too busy  fucking my wife.  You're too busy  with your hot wife  to do stand up.  Too much sex  to have to write jokes.  That's too much.  Too busy to think of jokes  I'm just fucking so much.  I'm just  I'm gonna jazz all over this.  I got too busy  jazzing on Nussies 
[01:41:00]  that I can't  too much doggy steez.  Too much doggy steez.  What's the sign language  shirt you got?  Where's that?  This one.  Vatos Locos.  Yeah what's the  Vatos Locos?  It's a P sign  and then L sign.  What is it?  Blood in Blood Out  that Vatos Locos  Kavino's half Mexican  so he really fucking  owns that.  It's a V and an L.  The V and the L.  The gang signs.  Yeah.  Oh I gotcha.  Any picture of Kavino  has him giving up  the VL.  So most of these  things are Kavino's. 
[01:41:30]  Yes he's the brains  of the operation  I just sit there.  I'm giving these sayings.  All these sayings.  The lame ones are Kavino  the good ones are mine.  That's how it works.  Alright.  But yeah.  Rich Kenny was telling us  that he prefers  your work on the show  very much too.  Kavino's been  Kavino's been  real fucking lame lately.  Anything we say  like he's in the fucking  just the  anything I say  I know some of the stuff  that I bring up  is corny  but he is just  like his wife  has a friend 
[01:42:00]  who teaches pole dancing  classes as like fitness.  What did I tell you?  Kenny knows.  Super fan.  And Kavino's like  why would you let  why would you let  your bro do that  that's horish.  Everything lately  has just been like  the grumpy old dudes.  So you guys are  splitting up soon.  Yeah pretty much.  Yeah.  Alright.  That's not it.  You're still like  dude broing  and Kavino's like  well I'm gonna  dad bro for a while.  And what's gonna happen  to the dude bro convention  if you guys break up?  Exactly.  What is the dude bro convention?  We're never gonna break up. 
[01:42:30]  All our listeners  from across the country  just all  they started doing it themselves.  They meet here  in a week in June  and we do like a ball game.  That's when I do  stand up once a year  and we set up events  for them and stuff.  You do a ball game?  We do play.  We go to like  Shea Stadium.  City Field or Yankee Stadium  rent out a section  and shit like that.  How many people show up?  Like a hundred or something.  A couple hundred.  That's fun.  Can't mark that.  No.  You get people.  We haven't done shit.  Nope.  We don't give back ever.  We haven't done shit.  Where do they stay?  They all stay in hotels?  They all stay in hotels. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Lodging.  I like that you were  I like that Jimmy's  thinking about lodging.  I know.  How much do these kids  pay?  You know what they do  that's really funny too?  They talk like Asian people.  I like that.  You love the Lee jokes right?  Yeah.  What's that bit?  It's just anytime  anytime you give someone  a characteristic  he just puts a  if someone puts a Lee  behind it  he'll just  I will imitate that person  as a Lee like  I don't know.  You gotta hear it. 
[01:43:30]  It's like describing  your comedy act.  It's fucking sad.  It never sounds funny  when you describe your jokes.  Believe me it's terrific.  They bang the gong  like the Asians do.  Can you listen to that  for your show?  I love it.  Who does the Asian voice better?  Covino or Rich?  I gotta give it to both of them.  Oh wow.  Just a good decision.  The morning mashup's  gonna fucking yell at me.  I gotta go.  By the way they  they yeah  Ryan I told Ryan  I had to apologize to you.  I'm like yo  Kenny's only  only anything but nice to us. 
[01:44:00]  Why is he yelling at Kenny?  Oh because he walked in the studio  when we were recording.  Yeah but the light was off.  I know but we were  your headphones were off  so I deduced that you were off.  I know.  We were recording phone calls  or something.  He didn't like that Kenny  just barged in.  Why does Ryan get so uptight?  I don't know  because people forget him sometimes.  The weatherman.  I hope he was just talking about  how he has no fucking idea  who Ryan is.  I try to believe I know  who he is now though.  Thank you guys  to have a fucking  introduce me to Ryan  when he  I want to see  I'll let him meet this new guy.  Don't have a sweet day.  That's later.  Sweet day. 
[01:44:30]  Don't have a sweet day.  Swoot means sweet  or something?  Yeah opposite sweet.  Have you learned nothing Opie?  I'm confused.  Is there going to be  a pop quiz on this shit?  Fucking swoot.  How do you not know  what that is?  Fucking cool.  What do you got jazz  in your ears?  I love that Rich  didn't want to own this.  No.  What?  I don't do this.  I don't do this.  You know what's even better?  He tried to throw his co-host  under the bus.  Hard.  Hard.  Like not even subtly.  No it's hard for Rich  because he's in 
[01:45:00]  hits one mode now.  Oh I see.  What's the water balloon test?  What'd that mean?  Water balloon.  Oh.  It's when you're  done nailing  a suspicious  a suspicious  nussy.  What's a suspicious  nussy?  Check for condom  leakage by filling it up  like a water balloon.  If she's really busted  throw it at her  and run.  I mean that's just  misogynistic.  Yeah.  I don't find that funny at all.  That's just very  very hurtful.  That's very rude.  And not only that 
[01:45:30]  but condoms don't break  on impact like water balloons.  Right.  So just bounce off her  and then you just get  a bunch of semen water  all over your...  You blow up a condom  pretty fucking...  Yeah.  A lot of pressure.  I feel mine would  fucking cum.  With jazz.  Fuck yeah jazz in it.  My mother's like  Chipper stop  get out of them bushes  you're jazzing  on your shoes.  Ah there's a word for  another word for  the female  in the general area.  Peach lips?  No.  No.  I thought it would  have been peach lips.  No. 
[01:46:00]  That's where you're wrong.  It's pusetta.  What?  Why wouldn't you  just say pussy?  I said...  Why wouldn't you  just say jizz?  I mean I guess  I get the jizz.  No he explained it.  I mean there was a time  we had to come up  with some shit.  Yeah but guess what?  But Maxim Radio  was uncensored.  It's a guy's network.  For guys!  Please don't say jizz.  They still say it.  Sam you should get  Covino on the after show.  He comes in like 10 o'clock.  Yeah to defend  the allegations from Rich. 
[01:46:30]  You know what?  There's some allegations  that have been  thrown out there now.  Unfortunately.  Oh it's Jimmy Day.  It's Jimmy Day.  I'm not going to be able  to have Covino on this.  Well then tomorrow  you'll have to get  into the allegations  from Rich.  I should actually.  Basically Rich did not  want to own any of this.  And you can play  a back that clip.  You can play  back that clip.  Oh no.  He tried fighting  until he realized  it was futile.  You know what I've  noticed about Rich?  What?  He's really creepy.  He doesn't blink.  Anyone else notice?  He does not blink. 
[01:47:00]  I didn't notice that.  And his eyes don't.  He's a good looking kid.  He's gorgeous.  But he doesn't focus.  It's really creepy.  Yeah he's a very nice dude.  But he probably has  Get Nicole back in here.  He probably has  a bite people  face rage.  Oh yeah.  He's probably a biter  when he fights.  Oh yeah.  He would fuck you up.  He just goes for anything?  Thumb in the eye?  Yeah.  Or he'd bite your cheek.  I noticed the whole time  he was in here  he didn't blink once.  He didn't really focus  on anyone.  But he was looking  at all of us.  Do you actually want  Nicole in here?  Yes I do.  Yeah.  Tell that bitch  to get in here.  Hey. 
[01:47:30]  Then we can wrap this up.  She's a nussy.  Not a bitch.  Is she a nussy?  No she's not.  She's old school.  Yeah you're right.  She's an old nuss.  We gotta get some terms.  Some of the old nuss.  I'm gonna get some terms  for this.  You gonna drop your own?  Fuck yeah man.  Yeah Jim.  Jimmy can come up  with some terms.  Hey Jim do you have  any duffs?  Oh.  We got  we got  we're not  What are duffs?  Hold on.  We got fans calling  and we're not fucking  go ahead Jeff  in Washington 
[01:48:00]  PA.  Go ahead.  Yeah I tell you what  I think  they actually have  a very good show  and you guys  are probably  should be thankful  to Indy for changing  the lineup  because they  got rid of the  Jay Thomas reruns  in the morning  which was a lead in  and they put on  this loser  Pete Dominick  and I came over  and I know  a lot of people  came over to your  show in the morning  because of that  but they're actually  very funny  if you ever listen  to them  you can probably  pick up some  pointers  pick up some ideas  Dude you jazzed  it all over yourself  with this  wait why don't

[01:52:00]  his oh my god  special on HBO  is this Saturday  at 10 o'clock  11 p.m.  pacific time  right  that doesn't  make sense  it's on 10 p.m.  Eastern  yeah 10 p.m.  Eastern  on HBO  and then what's  the PT  probably 7 I guess  so why is it  the 11th PT  maybe they air it  he's gonna air it  twice  yeah  maybe that's the  replay  I don't know  so technically  it'll be on 11th  look  let's go with  the 10 o'clock  ET  yeah 
[01:52:30]  on Louis C.K.'s  oh my god  comedy special  for HBO  this Saturday night  let's also tell  the people  that our pal  Louis C.K.  is on the cover  of fucking  Rolling Stone  that's awesome  how amazing  is that  I'm really  I just bought  a Rolling Stone  and I'm excited  now to buy  a new one  with Louis on it  I think that is  pretty much  the only magazine  I still buy  I love it  I read every  it's pretty much  the only one  whenever I'm traveling  if I see it  in the airport  a new one  I get excited  I always grab  Rolling Stone  when I'm traveling  to know that  Louis is on the cover  I'm more excited 
[01:53:00]  to read the feature  article  yeah this is  definitely  becoming a live read  for Rolling Stone  magazine  I was just thinking  that you know  but that's okay  because we all love  Rolling Stone magazine  it's an amazing magazine  and Louis is on the cover  I don't like their  music reviews so much  they're trying to be  a little too cool  for the room at times  but Louis is on the cover  but their long form  fucking articles  on artists  are just fucking terrific  they're the best  inside looks  on guys like Louis C.K.  who's on HBO  this weekend  oh yeah  Rolling Stone magazine  oh jeez  it's smaller  than it used to be 
[01:53:30]  it kind of is smaller  but that's okay  because a lot of  other magazines  going away  yeah  still in print  what are you watching  this weekend  huh  after you're done  reading Rolling Stone  you know Louis  is on HBO right  his special  yeah the people  already know that  I want to make sure  Rolling Stone survives  oh god  I walk by the newsstands  I see the magazines  going away  and I see they're  being replaced  by those weird  porn magazines  I don't like it  I'm taking notice  I don't like it  I want backstage  look at some  of my favorite artists  yes of course  like Louis C.K.  I wonder if he's  going to talk about 
[01:54:00]  this on his HBO special  what is it  Rolling Stone magazine  I sure hope so  do you think  well he already taped it  he taped it already  and it wouldn't have  come out yet  yeah  you know there's a lot  of magazines  that are sort of online  so you can kind of  take a peek  but Rolling Stone man  it just feels  fucking good in your  hands that magazine  it just feels good  it smells good  well HBO is also  I mean it's got HBO Go  HBO On Demand  the artwork in  Rolling Stone magazine  is pretty terrific  oh the photography  the photography is  very very good  yes  speaking of photography  and then I also like  when the Rolling Stone magazine  doesn't fucking go music 
[01:54:30]  and all of a sudden  they go with something else  that's happening in the world  they're like whoa  here's a nice little surprise  political pieces  or Louie for instance  Louie CK  on the cover  you see the poster  for his special  it's all over the city  it's cool  it's definitely cool  it's Saturday right  Saturday night  10pm Eastern  I wouldn't be surprised  if they use the same  photographer that does  stuff for Rolling Stone magazine  you like Rolling Stone magazine  right Rolling Stone magazine  huh  I love Rolling Stone  what do you like about it  pictures  yeah pictures  the photography  the people they put on the cover  like Louie CK

[01:59:00]  live  but if you can't  see me live  please just watch  comedy central  what are you rich  you're not gonna own it  you should own the fact  you got a comedy special  that's cool shit  but that's just how  fucking  I have no  like  I'm extremely insecure  so I'm just like  yeah  yeah whatever  fuck it  where'd you tape  Wilbur right  yeah actually we taped  it the Royale  down the street  from the Wilbur  it's like a dance club  that uh  and whenever you told  someone from Boston  they're like  what the fuck  are you doing  at the Royale  they're like  it's a fucking  dance club  how was it 
[01:59:30]  it was good  is it in the old  combat zone  I don't know  the combat zone  me and Jimmy  learned about  why the combat zone  is no longer  the combat zone  I knew something  had to happen  it used to be  like kind of  the porn area  of Boston  the seedy area  of Boston  and our driver  when Jimmy  was up there  filming his  comedy special  that's gonna be  amazing  when it comes out  in a few months  you filmed in March  right  end of March  last day of March  awesome  yeah like a week ago  a week and a half ago  two weeks yeah 
[02:00:00]  and uh  our driver said  they uh  they shut down  the combat zone  because the quarterback  of Harvard  got murdered  really  that's what he told us  the quarterback  of Harvard  got murdered  and Harvard  obviously has a  kind of has some  pull in that area  basically  fucking went to the city  and said  you're now gonna be  shutting this down  aren't you  yeah  meanwhile  just cause their fucking  guy went there  and got killed  they were celebrating  um  what did he say  the Ivy League  championship  how many years ago  was this  maybe you can look it up 
[02:00:30]  it's a while ago  it was late 80s  early 90s  and after winning  the Ivy League  championship  a bunch of the boys  went down there  including the  quarterback  and he got  fucking murdered  Jesus  and that was it  for the combat zone  that's when they  realized fuck  we gotta clean  this shit up  and I  ever since that guy  told me the story  I was wondering  if it was true or not  I wanted  yeah  76  oh 76  76  no the combat zone  was happening  after 76 though  was it there  when you guys 
[02:01:00]  were living there  I felt like  it sort of was  we were there  90  what were we  90  I forget  95 and 98  how did he get killed  stabbed  yes  well he was stabbed  that's what our  driver said  how's the story go  maybe when you were there  they talked about  the old combat zone  or it ain't what it  used to be  there's like  one street still  during the early  morning hours  the guy's  teammate was  approached by a  prostitute  while he was  sitting in a van  the prostitute  distracted the guy 
[02:01:30]  by fondling him  and then stole his  wallet  as the prostitute  ran away  the guy who got  murdered  pursued her  three men  came to help  the prostitute  and in the  ensuing altercation  one of the men  stabbed him  he was deprived  of oxygen  he had brain damage  he was in a coma  for 31 days  and then had a  heart attack  and died  did they get the  guy who did it  doesn't say  I don't think  it's a good idea  to chase  a nasty 
[02:02:00]  nussie  down the road  after she stole  your cabbage  holder  your cabbage  holder  I don't think  it's a good idea  to chase a  prostitute  if she's got  your cabbage  flap  right after she  fondles your  jazz dispenser  you might not  want to  you know  that can't be  a good thing  that's when you  go you know  what I'm gonna 
[02:02:30]  have to let that  one go  I don't think  you'd chase a  prostitute ever  she's a nussie  the FPS for pay  a nussie  speaking of  Boston  we got  Steve Sweeney  on the line  he probably  wouldn't know  the answer  Steve Sweeney  yes  we have never  talked before  sir but I'm  a big fan  of yours  this is Opie  from the Opie  and Anthony  show  and we got  Jim Norton  I gotta tell you  I'm a big fan  of yours  I remember  when you guys  were in Boston  and you said  that the mayor  passed away  do you remember  yeah kinda 
[02:03:00]  I was never  a big fan  of the mayor  so that  was the last  time you were  here right  I was just  up there  Jim Norton  was taping  a special  that's coming  out soon  and I just  happened to be  up there  as Mayor  Menino  was telling  Boston  that he's  stepping down  basically  did you hear  him  yeah we have  made fun  of his speech  for many  years sir  yeah the  last storm  we had  he said  it was  global warning  and the guy 
[02:03:30]  who predicted  it was  Frank Gore  who also  happens to be  the running  back for  San Francisco  what do you  think it is  with his  speech  do you think  he's dyslexic  or what is  it with him  well let me  give you an  example  he came out  at the  well first  of all  if you take  you know  a plane  into Logan  Airport  the first  voice that  greets people  is Mayor  Menino  and I can't  tell you how  many times  people have  said to me  what language  is that guy  speaking  am I in  the wrong  country  well welcome 
[02:04:00]  please enjoy  in the  neighborhood  bright  and dry  and then  at the  convention  he came  out  he says  hello  hello  and he  mentioned  all the  great democrats  like John  F. Kennedy  and Martha  Luther King  know what he's  got he's got  what fighters  get it  that thick  tongue  he talks 
[02:04:30]  like he's  been batted  around a  little bit  now why  it seems  like Boston  doesn't like  the guy  why was he  able to  stay mayor  for almost  20 years  he's crooked  oh  he uh  well  I mean  I can't  say that  but that's  the way  it works  because you  get 6,000  employees  in that  one building  city hall  and that's  your built  in base  right there  they're all  going to  keep their  jobs  but now  they've got  a whole new  slew of  candidates  and you guys  spent time 
[02:05:00]  here  you know  they all  talk the  same way  in every  sentence  it's quite  frankly  and at the  end of the  day  quite frankly  at the end  of the day  and uh  folks  right  folks like  Elizabeth Warren  they also like  to say  kick the can  oh yeah  kick the can  down the road  right they love  that one  so we don't  go over the  fiscal cliff  right  yes  who the  frick has ever  kicked the can  down the road  we've all  gone over  the fiscal  cliff  right 
[02:05:30]  already  they say  that  I don't  know  I don't  see any  difference  yet  but I'm  sure I  will  and now  we're in  April  so as soon  as the taxes  get paid  I'm sure  there'll be  a major  difference  I'm not a  big political  guy  I don't  believe in  any of  them  Steve  Sweeney  not a  one  Steve  we're  obsessed  with  Scorch  we watch  his show  and we  analyze it  and break  it down  and we  were surprised  to see  you on  it  so we  figured  that they  roped you  in somehow  yeah we  we  broke  somebody  told me 
[02:06:00]  that I  did it  and I  you know  I was  going to  a warehouse  in  Framingham  my friend  Sib  who  played for  Boston  and everything  he says  oh okay  so now  you're  going to  do this  Scorch  he was  the guy  on the  couch  right  yes  yeah we  we worked  me and  Anthony  worked with  Scorch  at AF  back in  the day  and we're  obsessed  with him  because  you know  he's got  this TV  show  that no  one is  watching  but in  his mind  he thinks  he's  Johnny Carson  that's why  we're 
[02:06:30]  fascinated  by this  guy  he truly  believes  that he  has millions  of viewers  and that  and that  he's just  he's only  days away  from being  offered  Jay Leno's  job  it's just  days  you're right  yeah  yeah and  all of a sudden  you know  we're watching  the last episode  and they say  you know  he says  he's got  Steve Sweeney  and we're like  really  yeah  because I  really am a  big fan  you're a  funny fuck  I am a  funny fuck  and  it's so weird  being on the  radio  saying that  oh sorry  on ZLX 
[02:07:00]  yeah and you  and you come out  and I could tell  you're just  bothered  because it  seemed like  you were  I don't know  you were sold  something that  it wasn't  no no  it wasn't that  you know  what really  bothered me  he  actually  he's a  very nice  guy  but  no I  like him  as a  person  don't get  me wrong  but anyway  so he's got  this idea  it's kind of  more like the  today show  than the  tonight show  so he's got  this cook  there  you know  and they're  going to do  a cooking  segment  and the guy  wouldn't let me  eat  I said  I'm starving 
[02:07:30]  I've been in  this warehouse  in Framingham  for two hours  you're not  going to let me  taste the food  no no not  until after we  shoot  so I was a  little edgy  you seemed  like you  hated  it was very  funny to  watch you  and Sib  just talking  and then you  wouldn't acknowledge  and Scorch  kept trying to  fucking shoehorn  himself in  by doing  things like  he would laugh  just to kind of  get the camera  to turn towards  Scorch  I think he was  coked out of  his mind  I had no idea  what he was  doing over there  and at one 
[02:08:00]  point you said  something really  funny too  you said  something about  yeah you said  this or whatever  else you were  lying about  like you called  him out on  lying  on his lies  which we thought  was very funny  yeah he's in  Manchester or  someplace New  Hampshire  well his show  opens with a  with a shot of  Santa Monica  Pier  oh really  yes  oh I gotta  see it  I gotta see that  even though he's  talking about  Manchester New  Hampshire  you know  you know what  it's so funny  you mentioned  that show  I was golfing  with Sib  yesterday  and he said 
[02:08:30]  they have one  sponsor  and the sponsor  is editing the  show  oh I don't like  this  I like  I said  are you  shitting me  wow  the sponsor  Procter and  Gamble goes in  and edits Ed  Sullivan  you know  it's like  right  yeah  Christ  that's funny  oh that's  okay so the  sponsor makes  decisions on  what's acceptable  and that's  probably the only  condition on  which they'd  sponsor the  show  that's right  yeah  and how's  your career  going Steve  through the  roof  yeah  Jesus Christ  I just  got off a  cruise ship  I didn't do  the carnival 
[02:09:00]  ones  you know  that's the  ones that  had all  problems  toilet paper  and all that  right  talk about  downhill  you walk  on board  there's a  Walmart  we cash  checks  here  we accept  food stamps  I'm working  at that  well I'll tell you  this weekend  I'm working  at a nice  little comedy  club  it's called  Giggles  on the North  Shore  in Boston  and I  like that  club  but  you know  I'm still  working  places named

[02:10:00]  to keep the  comedy scene  going all  these years  because we  work at these  Chinese restaurants  and to this  day after 30  years they still  don't know  what's going  on out there  I mean it  could be  karaoke  you know  but they  say oh  yeah  asses in  seats  asses in  seats  no problem  you know  right  so we're all  still working  and that's  why our  careers  are you  know  fucking  nowhere  and you  came up  with  who  Dennis Leary  and Gavin  I lived  with Leary  for a couple  of years  I did a bunch  of movies  yep  and you know 
[02:10:30]  I keep it  going  I like to  you know  I like to  work  unlike a lot  of comedians  because you  know at a  certain point  in life  I hate to  bring the  show down  that they  become like  their acts  you know  what I mean  sure  yeah  no  it's like  the road  thing gets  to them  and everything  but you know  I have a good  life here in Boston  I like it  but I got a  show I'm producing  that I think  is going to be  pretty cool  so  is it for showtime 
[02:11:00]  because you talked  about that on the  show  yeah  can I  can I call  your show  again  when we  get  oh of course  of course you can  you ever make it  to New York  yeah I get  on there  all right  let's fucking  do our show  next time you're  down  I would love  to do it  I love your  show  I can't believe  when you said  Menino died  because you know  all these people  are calling me up  because I've been  here forever  oh did you hear  the mayor  passed away  and everything  and I said  really huh  and then Menino  said that wasn't 
[02:11:30]  funny I don't think  I'm a family  in the whole game  oh man he was  up our ass  he made sure  we got fired  that's good though  but we already  knew we were  we admit it now  we already knew  we had job offers  in New York  so we were  kind of taking  some shots up there  we were taking  some major chances  knowing we had  a place to land  yeah no  it was exciting  you were joking  on Scorch's show  about being depressed  are you really depressed  me no  oh you're not  okay you were just kidding  he was just depressed  that day  oh okay  I don't know  oh no 
[02:12:00]  I was doing a bit  I say you know  I'm depressed  I went to a veterinarian  and I said  put me to sleep  and he said  what  and I said  alright  if you're not  going to put me down  fix me  cut my balls off  oh okay  alright  just to set up  one of those  phony comedy shit  yeah but me  I'm doing comedy  over 20 years  and I fell for it  what a fucking  dummy I am  yeah we're like  we gotta get  Steve Sweeney  on the phone  and talk him  off the ledge  it sounds like  he's fucking  gonna kill himself  I was worried about you  I'm like  but this guy  sounds really upset  about something  fuck  oh no 
[02:12:30]  no I'm just  you know  setting it up  baby  what a fucking  knocking him over  what a dumb  cunt I am  you are a dumb  cunt  Jesus Christ  I can't believe  you used that word  on the radio  oh it's fantastic  isn't it  it's freeing  it's the only word  that has any power  left in the English  language  right  everybody says  fuck  but when you say  cunt  ooh  everything quiet  that stops everything  doesn't it  yeah  the c word  yeah drop an n-bomb  in front of it  and watch the reaction  you get  oh my god  oh he's the only one

[02:18:00]  there's guys that are  funny off stage  funny fucking guys  and then on stage  not so much  then you got guys  that are absolutely  not funny off stage  but know how to be funny  on stage with their act  and then you got  the rare one  both  the dual threat  and that's Louis C.K.  absolutely  there's only a handful  of guys that are actually  really really funny  when they're not doing  their act  and then just as funny  doing their act 
[02:18:30]  right?  yeah  I think  I think more often  than not  guys are  a mix  they're both  you think they're both  yeah  a lot of my friends  are  I mean all my friends  are hilarious  off stage and on stage  well we get the guys  that are just funny people  yeah  and then you know  they also are funny  on the stage  yes  but I've seen a lot  a lot of guys  that are just  not funny people  it's weird  but pull it off  on stage  yeah  Louis C.K.  is funny on stage  funny off stage

[02:24:30]  I've never seen her  yeah I'm very  attracted to her  yeah I noticed her  when she was doing  Sports Nation  I get no sexual  vibes off her  whatsoever  none  none  oh wow  she's fucking  free to friendship  yeah she's got  the gym  yeah exactly  look who it is  it's Jim  you're my buddy  hey  punches you in the arm  I had that happen  with a girl  you mean  boink you in the arm  boink  don't you try to bring  back that lexicon  that failed  I had that happen 
[02:25:00]  with a girl  I kind of have a crush on  it's my cousin's friend  and I texted her  and she texted me back  hey guy  and I was like  oh  wow  there goes that  oh well  she is hot  she's eight  apparently she hates  Aaron Andrews  does she really  yeah Sam's trying to  promote one of his videos  what are you going to  talk about then  no wrestling  no Michelle B  you know maybe  I should just  shut my mouth  why does she hate EA  200,000 people  just screamed yes 
[02:25:30]  in their cars  I didn't know  how to say that  Jimmy nailed it  let me see a picture  yeah I  yeah I find her  to be very attractive  although I'm sure  she's involved  with a fellow  probably an athlete too  of course  believe me  with a big donger  oh god  she's probably  involved with a guy  how do they say penis  on that other show  I hope it's donger  donger  what is it  so Jimmy's going to be  on that show  that's very cool  yeah I've done it before  it's a fun show  it's a quick segment  you talk sports  you have to 
[02:26:00]  it's called  I think the crossover  where they both  they talk about  something that happened  and they both  take a side  and I have to  just kind of  throw in a line  and decide who's right  and give a quick  reason why  it's not a long segment  it's pretty  it's painless  but I don't know  what we're talking  about today  I'll have to  I'll have to get  this skinny  when I get home  get briefed  got a few people  that know a thing  or two about sports  I wish we knew  ahead of time  we could help  the appearance  we could  boost up  boost up your knowledge  speaking of sports  did we get the  Bubba Watson thing  yes 
[02:26:30]  what about Bubba Watson  he cries  he cries a lot  he's a golfer  Jesus  you got me  Jim actually had me  for a legitimate  three seconds  he's like  Bubba Watson's dead  he's all about  the hovercraft  though  he's bringing  the hovercraft  to the golf courses  I guess that wasn't  a joke  I don't know  are you sure  if it was  he never said it  the hovercraft  was a complete  hoax you dummy  it was a complete  hoax  he said it was a hoax  he's acting  yeah I know  acting  I didn't want him  to know that  I knew he was acting 
[02:27:00]  oh Nicole  Nicole  bullshit  I'm not looking  no it is  big star today  big star  bullshit  she ain't coming  she's  oh  what  why are you getting mad  she didn't come in  after I texted her  because we have our show  and they get mad  when you guys call us  when we're on the air  who  Ryan who do you think  the guys who don't get invited  we're promoting the morning mashup  it's just the weather guy  we're promoting the morning mashup  Ryan gets mad  is he a tyrant  is he hitting you  look at me in the eyes 
[02:27:30]  does he hit you  is it because he can't  guess what the weather is  nationally  which guy  no we just  we know  we love to come in  but just if we're in the middle  it's just one of those days  where we need to lie  hold on listen  I have to finally say it  what's wrong with Rich  with Rich  he's a good looking kid  we all know that  but he doesn't look anyone in the eye  and he doesn't blink  it's a nervous habit  it's a nervous habit he has  it's a nervous  you know what  he yeah like he walks into the room  and he like looks at you  out of the corner of his eye  and you're like  I'm right here  he's just defending him  because he's more racist  he's suspicious right now  he's so suspicious 
[02:28:00]  he's looking out for me  they're very protective of their girl  we love you  you know that  he's on the spectrum  we think he's on the spectrum  to be honest with you  that's really mean  because you always wonder  what happens to autistic kids  so you think Rich Davis is autistic  yeah they grow up to be like  but he's so fabulous on the air  but they never say  he's a terrific broadcaster  when he's not  over modulating everything  I don't  yeah he does over modulate us  I don't know  but what's the deal with not blinking  that's all I want to know  he blinks 
[02:28:30]  he doesn't really blink  and he can see a lot of the whites  in his eyes  which is a sign supposedly  maybe I'll focus more on it today  I'll check it out  I'll do some investigation  because I've never really noticed  I know the eye thing  that you're talking about  where he doesn't always look at you  he's looking  but he looks through people  I never noticed that  oh god I know this shit  it's like the way a predator  doesn't recognize its prey  as a fellow animal  right  just like that actually  he's got a box of nipples somewhere  yeah  could be  I'm guessing  look he's waiting for you  because he's very paranoid  they're very worried about you  and then you know  he's paranoid  is it Ryan 
[02:29:00]  this Ryan sounds like a problem  it's Ryan and Stan  because they don't get invited on as much  I love Stan  I don't know Ryan  does he know  exactly  we really don't know Ryan  why do you think he gets mad  that Nicole and Rich do the show  because he doesn't get invited  we don't know who he is  he's been in here before Jimmy  but at this point  I just make believe  I know him now  hey what's up boss  no because I know it's a problem  so now I make believe  I know him  hey Brian  hey dude  bring Ryan in  it went from a bit  Brian with a B  or Ryan  it went from a bit  to a little too real  so now what I do 
[02:29:30]  is I make believe I know  but I still don't really know him  you want to hear real  huh  alright I'll tell you  and this is not nice  but I'm going to tell you  look Rich had to go in the other room  because he's worried  we're talking about  he's worried that you guys  are saying mean things to me  no he's not  he knows you can take care of yourself  he knows that  alright go ahead  real Sam  Ryan  Ryan  we were hanging out  with the whole mashup  me and Jess were there  yeah  and Jess leaned into me  and she goes  can I tell you something  he whispered  and I go yeah  and she goes  I always forget  there's a fourth person

[02:36:00]  the only thing I did with it  you know I didn't  out of respect  out of  honor  pause  ok at this point  it's too much  you think he's a dude bro  or do they take your dude bro  status away  because you're crying  well you know what though  oh wait he's not a dude bro  because he's a dad  so he's a dad dude  I think he's a dad bro  bro dude  he's crying right now  he's dead  saying out of respect  like with the jacket  it would be great  if he said something horrible 
[02:36:30]  I got to respect  I refused to shake hands  with any negro  while I was wearing it  because they're not allowed  in the club  and I don't want to  break that rule  no they let women in  all of a sudden  finally they gave in  kind of leaves the rice  there you go  that's a twofer  if you're gonna pick a woman  man Condoleezza Rice  is the woman you pick  right  every time  we're talking  fucking pure  and nussy  right there  Condoleezza Rice  what a nuss 
[02:37:00]  you know what the N  stands for right  oh hey  nice  ok  alright get your  fucking head out  I was with you  that was really  I was a test  you almost fucking  failed sir  that almost felt  like a meeting  alright  let's go to the next question 
[02:37:30]  I'll finish this one  ok  let's go to the next question  what would you say  to your dead parents  if you could talk to them  did you think of your dead family members  when you won that jack  what's father's day like  is it a sad holiday for you  oh my god  I'm honored for Augusta National  and one of the greatest  clubs we have  one of the greatest tournaments 
[02:38:00]  out of respect for them  I didn't  do any of my  funny antics  that I normally would do  the only thing I did  is wrapped him up in it  this is like  this reminds me of  coffee talk  on SNL  right  where she kept getting  verklempt  it's like  talks amongst yourselves  good old Mike Myers  he's terrific  we had him in  he does seem to cry  you know  at the Masters  it didn't bother me  when he cried  but he does seem 
[02:38:30]  to have a hair trigger  he's cried a lot  yeah  this is  I don't know  he's cried a lot  I know that for  for sure  and he has a pink driver  a pink driver  you make the conclusion  are you revoking  his dad bro status  absolutely  that ends our press conference  that's it  Bubba Watson crying  Masters start up tomorrow 
[02:39:00]  I love watching  the Masters  it's relaxing  it is  I love watching  golf on Sundays  it's perfect  we're not going to  talk about golf  I'd rather watch  anything but golf  on Sundays  you really don't like  watching golf  never  no  what do you hate  about it  just my sport  bores me terribly  it's like a  background thing  you're doing some  shit  checking your numbers  on your Twitter  maybe  and you check out  a shot here and there  I like how you make  it sound like it's  accounting  you're like  just on the Twitter  checking numbers  I check all my numbers 
[02:39:30]  run the numbers  make sure they come back  check how many followers  how many views  how many likes  I'm all about it  I'm always checking my numbers  you know your social media  so  you don't like golf  zero interest  the Masters is the big one though  oh cool  there's not a bigger tournament  there's not a bigger tournament  I would imagine  why would that be  there's a buzz in the air  sure  Tiger Woods is happy  and they're saying  when Tiger Woods is happy  look out  Tiger I like  and he's the only one  I'm interested in  he's the only one  in golf  because he banged broads 
[02:40:00]  I always liked him  he hasn't won  one of the big tournaments  in a while  he was nice to me  when I met him  so therefore  I'll always like him  he hasn't won a major  is what I was going for  since what  2009 US Open  is it that long  I don't know  it might be  2010  so he's pushing  four years  without  last opening  last opening  he won  the last major  he won  I think was the US Open  when he had that  ripped knee  he has 14 majors  and the record  I think is 18  right  with Jack 
[02:40:30]  Nicholas  I believe  so this is a real  big deal  because you know  it was a given  that he was going to  you know  beat Jack's  majors record  but now it's not  not a given anymore  not so much  he's cut his labbermouth  really messed him up  is he still young enough  to break Jack's record  oh yeah  yeah he's having  a sick year already  he's already won  a couple tournaments  yeah he's  he's looking really  fucking good  and he's number one  in the world again  he is right  he's 30  fuck how old's  Tiger now man  he's got to be  33 
[02:41:00]  34 maybe  maybe even older  than that at this point  higher you're saying  37  37  wow really  holy fuck  holy fuck  37  how old can a golfer  play until  until they're like  no longer viable  I mean they're  I mean they're playing  you know  they go to the senior  tour at 50  no no but I mean  on this regular tour  45  I was going to say  mid 40s  but 41  43 is fine  you could  yeah yeah  you could certainly  win after you're  45 but not  not as much  that's sort of 
[02:41:30]  been the way  how old is  Vijay Singh  Vijay is  48 I would say  he's getting up there  yeah  we're still talking  about golf  how about Phil  Mickelson  Phil is about  40  that choke  41 maybe  is he a choke  he tends to choke  he has choked  Phil Mickelson  he tends to choke  a lot  his wife is  smoking hot  he's rich right  oh yeah  aren't all golfers  rich  isn't that like a thing  yeah a lot of these 
[02:42:00]  guys make way more  money off the course  than on  they play  yeah  let me see  is she pretty  oh yeah  yeah  yeah she is  wow  he married a kid  damn  Phil's a big guy  you know he has  just a giant  fucking  sloppy  retard hog  yeah  big dumb  John Kerry face  let me see him  is he a big guy  or is she just tiny  I think he's pretty  big I guess  I don't know  she is  smoking hot 
[02:42:30]  those awful  golf shirts  those shiny  fucking golf shirts  they look like  the minute  I mean she  yeah dude  she's  yeah  she's alright  so I can't wait  it starts tomorrow  so I need a pretty  young wife  you want a wife  yes  breaking news  would you get married  no  maybe someday  I think someday  it would have to be  like the  ultimate perfect  situation  yeah  I can see  every other woman  was dead  would you be a  would you be a father  well not by my 
[02:43:00]  I mean you know  no I mean  if the option was  either that or  pushing her down the  steps  I guess so  would you want to  be a father someday  I have no desire  at this point  none  none whatsoever  not even the smallest  no  zero  I always knew  I wanted to be a  father  I'd do it  you would do it  I'd have a kid  yeah  you got a fucking  I got jazz in some  you got jazz in some  what is it called  nassi  no the  puss  oh here he comes  oh  pussetta  oh you got jazz in

[02:45:30]  because the listener  thinks it's cute  she's like  honey are you  Ernie  and he's like  ugh  and then you say  no I'm Bert  and then you say  what's Bert  and it's someone  who's about to  give a black eye  to a woman  abusive husband  you guys are  little FFFers  what's that  a devoted listener  of the show  stands for  fun  fearless  female  damn it  what's a  all my FFFers  out there  fuck don't fuck  I know  I was guessing 
[02:46:00]  fat face fuckers  oh speaking of  they have fat kid  Friday  oh good  you know what  dad  my eye  boom  I got my monocle  I missed a peanut  boom  you know why  he had eye surgery  he had a hole in it  what do you mean  he had a hole in it  he says brain surgery  next  I don't know  I think from what  he said on the podcast  he had like a  he had like a little  problem with his eye  it was like maybe  they had to put a hole  in the back of it  and blow it  I don't know  to relieve pressure  yeah something like that  how do you put a hole 
[02:46:30]  in the back of your eye  I don't know  he said it was like  a pretty major surgery  I thought it was today  but then Roland told me  it was yesterday  nah he vined that shit  he did  he's all about the vine  I don't follow vine  I don't  it's too much  I don't like it  yeah I have enough  numbers to check  I can't start checking  my vine numbers  you're gonna go nuts  you're not even gonna  be able to watch your golf  by the way  Tiger Woods  the last major he won  I found on Twitter  2008  Torrey Pines  it was 08  that's impossible  I want to say  that's impossible  right  didn't he win the US  he won the US Open  before his news 
[02:47:00]  when did he have  all the problems  because that's a while  that's a while already  2011  right  nah  yes  two years  two years this past  November  I remember being  at a hockey game  when that came in  I remember being  really bummed about that  so it was 2010  because I'm a big  Tiger Woods fan  it was Thanksgiving 2010  yeah it was right around there  that's when it happened  because it was the day after  and he didn't win a major  he hasn't won it since  2008  ah  that'd be four and a half  years ago  this is Scandi  oh what's Scandi  what was Scandi 
[02:47:30]  sorry  something scandalous  oh  it's just  but at least  you don't have to use  Tokyo  Tokyo  I looked that up  you didn't even see me  look at it did you Sam  no you're good  what's Tokyo  well  that'd be if we were  discussing something sexually  and that's my safe word  to tell you I'm not  comfortable speaking  about this  oh god really  wait a minute  so  Jim Tokyo  if you're talking  about fisting  hey you know  my girl and I  were kissing  and  and then I  gave her a little  a little duna 
[02:48:00]  or a touch  and then I  curled up my fingers  and shoved in my fist  Tokyo  yeah I want to go to Tokyo  Tokyo  is that how they do it  oh my god  imagine this  okay how about  this discussion  I just  I get this urge  what's the urge  well it's like  you know  I just want to go out  and brutally rape  anyone yelling  Japanese cities  Tokyo  no Jim 
[02:48:30]  that's well worthy  what's well worthy  well  well worthy  is  your obsession  or love  for a person  is so strong  that you want  to kidnap them  and put them  in a well  just like  Silence of the Lamb  style  and put lotion  all over their body  well that makes sense  well worthy  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  you'd want to  kidnap someone  and put them  in a well 
[02:49:00]  that doesn't even  that's not even  well worthy  that's not even  logical  that's a brutal  crime  it's not a  Bethos  what's a Bethos  that's not  you're pronouncing  the word correctly  Bethish  Bethos  it's like  tomato  tomato  tomato  tomato  the word's  the word's  Bethos  it's Bethos  B-E-T-H-O-S  Bethos  the word's Bethos  he's saying Bethos  you got an accent  how dare you  you got an accent 
[02:49:30]  you got an accent  retard boy  said  yes  wait  now I'm  confused  Bethos  yeah it's  Bethos  yeah it is  Bethos  go ahead  what is  Bethos  that feeling  you get  when in  or observing  an awkward  situation  like a  nerdy guy  trying to  pick up  another guy  a nerdy  what  no  what  I don't  know  why Bethos  for that  Bethos  a nerdy guy  trying to  pick up  a guy 
[02:50:00]  a guy  that's  that's gotta  be  it's supposed  to be  girl  right  I think so  a nerdy  guy  trying to  pick up  a guy  what  what  I mean  that's a  very specific  term to  use  in a situation  they don't  want to get  the gays  mad  so they  figure  like  if they  say  nerdy  guy  that  would  be  weird  yeah  they're  talking  about  two  gay  guys  picking  each  other  up  but  nerdy  guy  that  makes  them  uncomfortable  they're  okay  with  gay  gayship  not  nerdy  gayship  yeah 
[02:50:30]  we don't  want socially  awkward  gays  we want  the flamboyant  sassy  right  I think  that's what  they're talking  about  I think  it might  be just  a typo  yeah  I think  this sentence  is bathos  guys  Tokyo  anything else  I'm calling  Tokyo on this  no  the dude bro  nation  never goes  Tokyo  dad bro  we never  go to Tokyo  don't go  Tokyo  on me  Jesus  they're a little  lackluster  with their  wake up isms  why  that's it  that's all  they got  yeah but  maybe they're  adding to it  as they go  I hope so  nothing wrong  with that  right  yeah  what kind  of videos

Or is it  We discussed this one right?  Yeah but I had like a thing where  I would  There's a restaurant  And I billow in smoke  And what we do is  We yell fire  And then when everybody's running out  We've cut a big section  Out of the front walk  And they fall into this like hole  Genius  It's genius 
[03:07:00]  Yeah  What's in the hole though?  Just the basement floor  They fall through to the basement  He's been coming up with these pranks  They're amazing  Yeah  It's unbelievable  I'll add it to the other pranks he came up with  Yeah but G.H.  Oh yes Kenny  We should give Swayze Universe an honorable mention  As far as what?  He's on Shady 45  So he's coming up with vocabulary too?  No  I looked at their website  There's not too much happening 
[03:07:30]  I really don't listen to their show  Because it's on the same time as yours  I just had a nice conversation with Sway in the hallway  We were both talking about accidental races  Yeah  I always say  Good morning Mr. Sway  Every morning  And does he like that?  Yeah  Yeah  That's what I say to him  Good morning Mr. Sway  Every morning  Swoo  Yeah  Swoo is a bad thing  Oh  Fuck  Yeah but he's got DJ Wonder on his show  Alright  That can't be bad  I don't know  Who Kid's on that channel too 
[03:08:00]  Yes he is  But they also have like the happy hour with Heather B  Heather B has been very nice to us since she came aboard  Yeah  She's from the first real world, New York  Yeah so  They don't get on until 8 in the morning  So if you wake up late  She has a very nice smile  She didn't smile during the real world show  But she's very smiley around here  Okay  Yeah  She's a delight  Yeah it must be the atmosphere where you work  I think so 
[03:08:30]  Alright  It's a happy place  Yeah so Sway's Universe gets an honorable mention  Alright  Shady 45  Good for them  Alright  By the way I got an update on the Times Square characters  Remember we said the city would have to fucking shut him down now  You hear about  Was it Cookie Monster?  Yeah  Pushed over a two year old?  Yeah  Because his mom couldn't pay?  Yeah  We've been talking about this off and on for a while now  There's some creeps down there in costumes  Oh yeah I saw Iron Man the other day coming off the 49th Street station 
[03:09:00]  Did you really?  Just really colorful language coming down the stairs with his Iron Man mask off  And it used to be you know you go down there as a character  And you know you take pictures of the Roller Taurus  And if they give you money whatever  But now they have like badges or something that say donation please  They're polite about it  But as soon as you take a picture  This actually happened to us recently  Because my sister buys into all that shit  Because she's from Florida  And she came up and she was all like  Ah Times Square all about it  And she got a picture with I think Mario Brothers 
[03:09:30]  One of the Mario Brothers  Because her daughter is a big Mario Kart fan or something  And as soon as she took the picture  And she was walking away  This guy kind of aggressively showed the badge  Like donation please  But it was more like donation  Yeah  So we gave them a couple bucks  But anyway they're very aggressive if you don't pay  And one of them pushed a two year old over  If you want to blow anybody's mind  Go to the 49th Street end train stop  Really? 
[03:10:00]  Right there  Because that's where they hang out  That's where they take their helmets off  Oh really?  And have a cigarette?  Yeah they're always just sweating  Because it's like a three stair exit  And you always just on the second stairway  Where that little landing is  There's always like Elmo and Mario  Just like  Yes I did  Just like hanging out talking  And you're like  Oh shit you could really ruin a kid's day  And they're all just getting along  Yeah they're all just talking  I bet they're treading secrets  I'm sure  Tips  I created a new children's character 
[03:10:30]  What is it Chip?  It's called Clucky Donk  And it's a green monster  With like a bunch of ears on his chest  Why is he green?  It's just green with envy  Clucky Donk  Why?  We all knew why he was green  I didn't really all know why he's green  He's got like 30 ears on him  Why?  Because he hears everything  He hears if you've been good or bad  Scrapes are good 
[03:11:00]  Anyway we said the city would move in  Now that they're pushing two year olds over  But the city officials basically saying  They're powerless to stop these guys  That amazes me  How are they powerless?  But I smoke a cigarette  And all of a sudden they shut me down  And they'll tackle you to the ground  Because I'm three blocks within Times Square  Smoking a cigarette  I'm not a fan of shutting anyone down  But I was surprised to hear  That they can't really do much about that one  When they can do something about everything else 
[03:11:30]  Yeah  They can though  They can just stop these people from doing it  You would assume  They would get some kind of permit thing  Or something  Just so they could keep track  Of who's doing what down there  Or get the IRS down there  Because they're making some free fucking tax money  Isn't it copyright infringement?  You would assume  Doesn't Disney or Nintendo  Or Sesame Street  Get down there  You would assume the Elmo people aren't happy  That he's getting arrested  Oh yeah  That's the classic picture online  If you Google image it  The guy is holding his own Elmo head 
[03:12:00]  As he's in handcuffs  Next to an NYPD fucking  Get in the car  Get in the car Elmo  I don't give a shit what you did  Look there it is  What's your name buddy?  What's your name buddy?  I don't tell you where I live  You do not find out where I live  What did Elmo  Are there kids in the back?  Oh yeah  People love it  He was outside Toys R Us  Yeah  Oh that's the best  What did that guy do?  You know how many kids that fucked up?  Like what a wonderful day at Toys R Us  And oh my god 
[03:12:30]  What's happening to Elmo?  Elmo's getting arrested  Elmo's Algerian?  Yeah  Because to them  That's the real Elmo man  That's who's under there  Only one guy  And there he is  Getting arrested  He was screaming about Jews  Oh he's the Jew guy?  Yeah  No he wasn't  Yeah  Yeah we talked about this yesterday  What?  He was screaming about Jews  I don't know why  You know how many parents had to do the  No he said Jews  Shit  No he wasn't talking about Jews  Yeah  We all know why he's screaming about Jews  Cop was quoted in the article saying 
[03:13:00]  Dude I just arrested Elmo  Oh really?  Yeah  That's what he's probably saying right in that picture  Well that's gotta be exciting  Hey look who I took down  Right  Elmo  This fucking asshole  Get in the car Elmo  Get in the car  I wonder if he's nude under that thing  Like what happens when he goes to jail  They have to take him out of the suit  He would probably just wear underpants  Because that suit probably gets really hot  He'd probably get gamey  We'll say it again man  We met the Philly fanatic  He came in when we were broadcasting in Philly  The smell coming off that costume  Was fucking brutal 
[03:13:30]  He can't clean it that often  It was unbelievable how bad that costume smelled  Can you imagine these guys like in two months  All these guys that are in Times Square  When it's like 94 out  Oh just fucking  90% humidity  Getting the sweat that goes right down your ass crack  Yeah but even when you're  Picks up a thing or two  And then moves it to your legs  Yeah but even when you're a normal person  Wearing shorts and a t-shirt  These guys are in fucking burlap sacks  Covered in hair  It's gotta be horrible  Alright we're gonna step aside for the Jim Norton show 
[03:14:00]  I think we did everything  Iraq what did we miss today?  I think you got it  Exactly  He's not quite sure what you did so  Wasn't paying attention?  Nah not for the whole show no  Iraq comment?  Why would I?  You guys did a great show today  Thank you Kenny  Thank you so much  Don't forget Dan Aykroyd tomorrow  Yes and Andrea DiMatteo  Who we've never talked to  From The Sopranos right?

[03:14:30]  Don't know she's doing something  She had kids  Yeah she was on Sense of Anarchy  That's what it was  Yeah  Yeah she's great  Is she still hot?  Yeah  Yeah  Super hot  She got tattoos  You like that or not so much?

[03:17:30]  Now Bobo has a dog  Named Mr. Malonegan  However  As you can see  He has decided to spell it  Mr. Malonegan  M-A-L-L-O-N-A-G-E-N  Okay  Yeah  That's  Not even phonetically  No  He lives with like  People with full brains right?  Yes he does  So why doesn't he  At least say  Hey  How do you spell our dog's name?  He's fairly confident  In his spelling  He didn't think  That he had gotten it wrong  Alright fair enough  And uh  Yeah

[03:22:00]  Starts now  Yes it does  Is my microphone on?  Okay  Maybe my  Oh I needed to raise my headphone volume  Thank God  I didn't just start yelling  Talking louder  That would have been embarrassing  For everybody  So I'm very tired today  I was almost dozing off  At the end of the  Opie and Anthony  Anthony was not in today  He's ill  He just has a bad cold  Whatever  I'm too tired 
[03:22:30]  To even improv  Something funny  He just has a cold  So  You know the apnea  I keep talking about it  Then I talked to somebody  And they were talking  About adrenal fatigue  I don't even know  If that's a real thing  Or not  Or if I have it  Or if people have it  But I'm just  I can't fucking  I gotta get the right machine  I just can't do this anymore  It hasn't gotten better  Since you lost some of the weight  I might have been using the machine  No because it was never  A weight thing for me  That doesn't help  With my central apnea  And I apologize  To people who are  Very sick of hearing this  Believe me  If you're sick of hearing it  I turned to look at something before 
[03:23:00]  And I felt like woozy  Like my equilibrium was off  That's how tired I am  So it's just fucking torture  To always be tired  And I know a lot of you guys  Deal with it  A lot of people have  Much harder jobs than I do  For me it's just a pain in the ass  Like I'm not physically  In danger of dropping  A fucking pallet on my foot  Or driving a truck  Into a rear ending  In another car on the highway  I don't know how you guys  That do manual labor  And have really hard 
[03:23:30]  Physical jobs do this  I just don't know  How anybody does  I don't know how athletes do this  How do guys in the UFC  Or in the NFL  Or boxers or whatever  I'm sure some of them  Have had apnea  What machine are you using now?  Well the one that they gave me  Which I knew the fucking  Stupid bitch technician was wrong  They just gave me a BiPAP  And I knew it was wrong  I knew it was wrong  But people in the medical profession  Just stink  Because you can't tell them anything  You can't tell  Because you know  Central apnea is when your brain 
[03:24:00]  Doesn't send the signal  So I would stop breathing  And then she  I woke up gasping for air  Because she put me on this  Dog shit BiPAP machine  In the middle of my test  And I'm like  This is not working for me  She goes no you don't need ASV  Because it breathes for you  You don't need that  I'm like that's what a fucking  Central apnea thing is  You dumb cunt  I didn't say that of course  I just thought it  Alright  Let's see what  My wife won't go down on me  Tommy  And every other married guy in America  What's going on Jim? 
[03:24:30]  Hey buddy  Hey  I was calling  I'm having a frustrating time  My wife  She just  She won't blow me man  I don't know what's  The problem  She said it was my weight  And I've lost like  40-50 pounds  And she still won't do it  And then I'm wondering  Is there something wrong with me  Because my ex-wife  She wouldn't go down on me either  Okay  A couple things here  She actually said it was your weight  When do you want her to blow you?  I mean 
[03:25:00]  Just  The real  Well  When we first  When we first got married  I was a little heavy  And I  I knocked off  Like  40-50 pounds  How much do you weigh?  Now  Right now  About  3-30  Okay  So what happens is  Your dick and balls  Probably smell  That's all I can guess  Because if she mentioned  The weight  A lot of times  Guys don't realize  That our balls smell  So I mean  I would have said that  Even if you were thin  Or if you're heavier 
[03:25:30]  It's more likely  But I mean  Even if you were a thin guy  It could be that too  Your dick and balls  Might have an unpleasant odor  Or your ass crack bites  Stink  And you don't know it  Do you shower immediately  Before you want her  To go down on you?  Do you shave your pubes?  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I mean  I shower  You know  Right before bed  I keep myself groomed  And everything  And  I just  I can't figure it out  Man  I mean  I go down on her  Right  No problem  What's her answer 
[03:26:00]  When you say  Now I've lost weight  What's her answer?  She's like  You know  You still need to lose  More weight  Or you know  Why is she such a  Why is she so fucking  Shitty-key about it?  I don't know man  You know  I thought  You know  Knocking off 50 pounds  You know  It'd be like  Some sort of reward  Especially  Wow  Like Valentine's Day  Just passing  I was getting geared up  And excited  And nothing  Is it really like this  This is why  I don't want to get married 
[03:26:30]  And I'm sure  Some of you married guys  Have great sex lives  But Tommy's tale  Is not unique  Married guys  Dude have been saying this  For centuries  And I've been hearing it  For obviously  Not centuries  Because I'm not that old  But it's  But it's  Something I've heard  Many times before  All I can think is  Just to have an honest  Heart to heart with her  And if it really is  Your weight  I think she's being  A little shitty about it  That she won't  Suck your dick  On the way down  Or maybe she's figuring  She wants you to get down  To like 250  And that will be  The motivating factor  I don't know man 
[03:27:00]  That's kind of frustrating  For you though  Yeah it really is  Because I mean dude  She  She doesn't have to  Do anything  But just  You know  Stay at home  I work  I pay all the bills  And everything  And I'm like  Stop eating your pussy  Yeah and then  I'm actually  I'm actually at the verge  Of considering  Going outside of the marriage  Because I mean  It's something that  I've had before  And it's something  That I crave  But I'm just like  Getting  Yeah blowjobs are great 
[03:27:30]  Any woman out there  Unless again  Unless there's a  Great reason  You're not sucking  Your husband's dick  If you're not sucking  Your husband or boyfriend's dick  And I mean on a  Fairly regular basis  You deserve  To get cheated on  Agreed  You absolutely deserve  To get cheated on  Because you're just  Being lazy  And you're not doing  What you're supposed  To be doing  You know  If he's paying the bills  And you're going  To work every day  And you're coming home  And again  As long as you're  Showering and cleaning  Yourself up 
[03:28:00]  And you're going  Down on her  If she's not  Sucking your dick  She's absolutely  Not doing her part  So I think you should  Go out and get a hooker  Just make sure  That you wear a rubber  And don't keep your wallet  In your back pocket  Okay  Okay  Appreciate that Jim  Great news man  Alright be good Tommy  Brian in Nebraska  I think the answer  To your question  Is going to be yes  Should I tell people  I date  That I used to be  A porn star  I do  And it's a lie  So yeah  So now you were  A porn star  Were you a gay porn star  Or were you  Did straight movies  No I was just straight 
[03:28:30]  I was  I actually had a contract  And everything  I wasn't none of this  Showing bullshit  That you know  A lot of people do  I legitimately work  For a company  But a lot of the girls  I meet  You know  I'm honest with them  You know  I got kids  Like everybody else  And all that  That's never a big deal  But then I go  Hey you know  I have this thing  In my past  I used to do porn  And they're just like  Yeah I'm not interested  Anymore  And it's  Really  I'm worried about you  Having something  Which everyone should know  Porn stars don't have anything  Because they can't  Hopefully you're fired  Right  Or it's 
[03:29:00]  You know  I don't think I can  Sleep with you  Because you've been  With so many women  You know  Some people say  They're intimidated  Which they get over it  Quickly  Because it's  Great  You know  But it's just  It's been a bit of a nuisance  Most of my life  You know  I was just with my  My ex now  For two years  And now I'm kind of  Getting back into  The swing of things  And I'm  I think I should be honest  About it  And some girls say  Why don't you just  Not say anything  Well here's  You can have a happy medium  Why don't you say something  After you've been with them  For a little while 
[03:29:30]  And after you've  Fucked them a few times  And after you've told them  Like god  This sex is so great  I'm really enjoying this  Like if  If a girl knows  That you're really  Digging the sex with her  And you've made it clear to her  And you've fucked a few times  And she's comfortable  Then  She may be intimidated  But she'll already have  A little bit of a history with you  So just don't tell them  Too soon  Because if you fuck somebody  A few times  And it's great  Then they'll go  Wow I didn't know  You were a porn guy  And I'm really fucking you well  You'll go yeah it's great  But this way  They don't have it in their head 
[03:30:00]  Before they fuck you  For the first time  What  I did that once  And I did that for a couple of years  And I really fell in love  With this one girl  Thought things were going to go  Pretty well  You know  We were together for six months  And then my friends told her  And she dropped me  Like a bad habit  She was so grossed out about it  She said  There's no way in hell  She thought it was the worst thing  That I didn't tell her  And I wasn't honest with her  Because she would have  Never have dated me  Well then she's somebody  That's not my wife now  Then she's something  Then women that you're better off  Not being around  Because if someone's going to  Judge you that harshly 
[03:30:30]  So why don't you  Like  That would be like  You going over everything  She's ever done  And going like  You fucked a black guy  Or you fucked more than two guys  And then judging her  And going  I never would have dated you  Like if you said that  Every woman would go  Wow this guy's shitty  You know  So she judged your past  So fuck her dude  You're better off without her  Fuck her  That's kind of the same thing  I was thinking  You're right  So I would tell them  Just not right away  But you know  I don't think that  That's being dishonest  Because it's not something  That affects your present  Technically it's none of their business 
[03:31:00]  And you want to make sure  That they know  That you're with them  And enjoying them first  So I would tell them  But just give it some time  Alright  Sounds good Jimmy  Love your show man  Thank you my friend  Take care  Who's Brian from Texas  Another Brian  Had apnea surgery  Yep  I had the  I had the sleep apnea  I did the study  And everything like that  And they put me on  The BiPAP machine  While I was in there  And then I woke up  And I just couldn't breathe  It just totally sucked  So I went back to my ENT  And he told me  I can either be on this machine  For the rest of my life  Or I can have the surgery 
[03:31:30]  And take care of the  The palate and the roof of my mouth  And a bunch of stuff  And you know  At the time I was 25  I said screw it  I'll go ahead and do the surgery  It was hell for two weeks  Because just the stitches  And everything like that  But don't have it anymore  Feel great  I don't fall asleep  While I was driving  Like I used to  A lot more energy  It sucks for a while  But it's definitely worth it  In the long run  Well I've heard about that surgery  I think they're called pillars  That they put in  But there's a couple different ways  That they do that  The reason I can't do that 
[03:32:00]  Is a couple reasons  I talk for a living  So I don't fuck up my throat at all  If I can help it  And also  I have complex apnea  So that would help  The obstructive part of it  Which is the tongue  But it would not help  The central apnea  Which is the brain signal  Which has something to do  With oxygenization  Of the blood or something  So that would not  Like I use a mouth guard  When I sleep  And it does help  Because it pushes my jaw forward  So I look stupid  But it does  Push your jaw forward  So your tongue  Doesn't fall back as much  And I sleep better 
[03:32:30]  But it does not help  The central apnea  So I'm happy  It worked for you man  But I actually need  The machine I think  Well I hope you find  Something man  Love you Jim  Thank you  Yeah right now  Because a fucking 45  Or a 9mm  Seem like great things  What's Cody saying  I have a lot of apnea calls  The phones always light up  For apnea  Because so many people  Deal with this  Yes Cody  Hey Jim  What's going on man  How are you  Hey man  It kills me to hear  All the problems  That you're going through  I have the exact same problem  I've tried all the machines  Had tests done 
[03:33:00]  And everything  And you know  The suggestion I have  It might seem a little  Funny or whatever  But honestly  I'm not for drugs  Or anything  And I don't drink  But smoking pot  Before I go to bed  Like one or two hits  It honestly  Honestly helps man  And I don't know  If my brain was just going too fast  It wouldn't allow me  To fall asleep  Or what was going on  But I sleep through the night  I never wake  But I feel 100% refreshed  And I don't abuse the drug  I don't smoke it during the day  It's just before I go to bed 
[03:33:30]  And it seemed to help  And I didn't have to have  Any surgery or anything  Well I envy you my friend  I  That would not be my case  I'm not lucky enough  To do that  But I do respect the fact  That you can do it  And lucky you man  I envy that  And wish I had that ability  I just don't  Yeah  And I respect the fact  You're drug free now  But yeah  It kills me  To hear all the pain  You go through Jim  Thank you buddy  I'm sure I'll get it fixed  Sooner or later  I need this last  I need what they call  A VPAP machine  And I just don't know  If I need to be tight 
[03:34:00]  You have to go in for a test  It's called titration  Which means you sleep  Through the night  The machine  And they know  Somebody in the other room  Like fucking  Dr. Frankenstein  Does all these knobs  Because you got 30  Wires on you and shit  And  You know  You got 30 wires on you  So  They test you  And they test all your reactions  And thank you for the call  I appreciate you calling in  But I think for the VPAP  Which is the  The ASV machine  I would need to be titrated again  So I have to go in for another fucking  Otherwise I just buy the machine outright 
[03:34:30]  I would just spend the five or six grand on it  If I thought it would work  It's worth it to me  They make you sleep on your back  With those things cemented on you  No you can sleep on your side  If you want  But you have 30 fucking wires coming  The fact that they haven't invented a way  To do that wirelessly  Like the amount of money  They'd probably make  If they could do that wirelessly  Or put softer  Much smaller sensors on you  How can we not do that?  We have things that can propel  We know how to send  A fucking ship  Out into space  And then allow gravity 
[03:35:00]  To throw it  From Jupiter  On to Saturn  On to Uranus  Or however  How can we can't find  Lightweight sleep apnea  Fucking titration  Test things  That's what I say to every girl  Right before I eat her pussy  I don't know why  It's just a ritual  I go through  I talk about apnea  And then I eat her box  Until the cows come home  Okay  Let's talk about  Justin in Kentucky  Because this is slightly  Complimentary for the kid  Yo  Are you there?  Yes sir  Yeah  First of all 
[03:35:30]  I want to say you're an inspiration man  I've seen some before  And after pictures  And it just  Thank you  Pretty good  But how much did you lose?  How long did it take you  To lose it?  I started  Around last  You know  Last April  When I was shooting  Please be offended  I had been in the gym  A little bit  But I got really serious  Probably  Over the summer sometime  Whenever Anthony's  Rotgut  Someone out there  Whenever Rotgut  Played that date last year  It was like May or June or July  Whenever that was 
[03:36:00]  Do you remember when Rotgut  Like I had been going casually  Before then  But I actually joined  Opie's gym  In like maybe  Over the summer  Or September or something  It was after Sam got married  And I've lost  I don't know  I weighed myself yesterday  After my shower  And I was 149.2  Now  The day before  I was like 151.2  So you know  I figure I'm 150  And at one point  I had weighed  Probably 180  Which is very high for me 
[03:36:30]  So I probably lost  About 25  25 pounds  And I want to lose  A few more  So hopefully  It'll be 30  When all is said and done  Which hotel are you though?  I mean you know  About 5  6.5  5.7  So for me  140 is a good weight  145 is a good weight  If it's all muscle  Or whatever  But I still have  The blubber in the gut  That's really  Hard to tighten up  Like if you watch  Morgan Spurlock's documentary  He does a documentary  Called Super Size Me  And he talks about  After he eats 
[03:37:00]  All this shit food  How it's hard  To get that last few things  Because fat cells  Stay fat cells  Or whatever  So I don't want  To do lipo  If I can help it  I want to  Work it off naturally  But once in a while  I still eat bad  Like yesterday  I ate a bunch of  Salsa chips  What's that?  You know  I still fuck up  Sometimes with the eating  The difference is  I just don't get discouraged  And I don't go ballistic  And do it  You know  I'll do it for one day  Or one meal  And then just go  Come on you cunt  Get back to it  So thank you very much  That was nice to hear Justin  I appreciate it  Let's see 
[03:37:30]  We have  Dave in New Hampshire  Naughty naughty Dave  Hey good morning Jim  I first want to say  I love your show  It's appointment  Listening  And you're a great  Alternative to all  The other sex shows  On the radio  Well thank you  Yeah I try to  And I try to think  Other topics as well  Because we talk about  Sex here  But I guess the way  We talk about sex  Is a little bit different  Than the way they talk  About it on like  Those doctor shows  So I say I guess  You're real in your  Assessments  And also you've probably  Been there and done that  Before so I appreciate it  Thank you very much 
[03:38:00]  My issue is  I've been in a  Well not really committed  A relationship for four years  The girl is wonderful  The only thing she doesn't do  Is take my load  Other than that  She's a nurse  She's got her own house  We don't live together  About 20 miles away  I'm in the middle of nowhere  Up here in New Hampshire  And I've cheated on her  Probably about 20 times  And for me  You know I'm looking for  Sex addicts  Anonymous or whatever  But there's really  Nothing up here  I'm on all these  Dating websites  And to me I guess  The thrill of it  Is just the feeling  Of new pussy  And I'm sure you can relate 
[03:38:30]  It's the hunt dude  It's a lot of times  It's the hunt  It's not  A lot of times  Excuse me  The sex is a letdown  A lot of times  I've been through situations  Where especially  In this era of  Texting and emailing  I've gone through  Almost full relationships  Without ever meeting  Or fucking the person  It's really  Bizarre  How you can fucking  Like so a lot of times  I've emotionally cheated  Not physically cheated  Right  Or you can physically cheat 
[03:39:00]  Which I've done too  And it's usually  Not about your partner  It's usually just about  The high  Like you said  About new pussy  Or about the chase  Or the excitement  Of opening the phone  And seeing  Did she text me  Will she send me a picture  What did she say  It's that fucking high  But with text message  I go through such  So Irock  You're staring at me crazy  What's going on  I was just wondering  You said you've gone  Through relationships  Without meeting the person  Yeah meaning  I've met people  Through the computer  Or online  Or fans  Or whatever  And then you go  Through this thing 
[03:39:30]  Where you're  Not a real relationship  But I mean  Like you're going  Through a relationship  In the sense  Where you're talking a lot  And you're asking them  Questions  And they're sending you  Pictures  And you're learning  About each other sexually  Like I go through  What are the phases  Of a relationship  And then all of a sudden  You kind of fade apart  Like ripples in the water  And you stop talking  And that's part  Of our new technology  So cheating  A lot of times  Like that guy  Who's wife  Is not sucking his dick  And she seems like  She's being kind of  Shitty about it  That's a guy  Who wants his dick sucked  And he's not  Getting his dick sucked  So him going to  Get his dick sucked 
[03:40:00]  By somebody  I get  But just cheating  On a woman  That's doing everything  I've been guilty of  We've all been guilty of it  And it's always about  Me being selfish  And there's nothing  To do with her  Right  And I perfectly get that  And you know  I know you and Anthony  Had the good boy phone  And the naughty boy phone  Which would have been  Perfect in my situation  She's found out  And has forgiven me  Okay  And it's that  It's that whole like  Attention thing  Like you're saying  Open up the phone  Open up the email  See if there's a couple  Pictures in there  You know  This is a girl  That I could probably  You know  She's down to earth 
[03:40:30]  She's wonderful  She's got a good head  Responsible  But I would love to  See myself within  Three or four years  But I can't get over that  Oh somebody else  Is paying attention to me  Or oh somebody else  Is going to show me  Their tits  Or something like that  I know you're not  In a relationship right now  But you know  The ones that you've been  In committed with  How did you get past that  And say to the girl  Alright I'm done  It's over with  I'm going to be  A good boy to you  Sometimes I didn't  Okay  And the times I did  It was good  I could be good  For a fairly long time  In a relationship 
[03:41:00]  But the problem is  I don't  You know  A lot of the nonsense  I don't address  Is the stuff  That's causing me  To do it  Like  It's usually not  Just about sex  Like again  For the guy  Who wants to get blown  I think it is  But like  If you're saying  That your girl  Does everything  You want her to do  And the sex is good  It's about something else  Like maybe  You're right  It's about attention  Or about excitement  Or something new  It's always about  Something else  So addressing that stuff  And figuring out  Why I do it  And then stopping  Some of the stuff  Before it gets to the point  Of me needing to cheat  And I'm telling you this 
[03:41:30]  Not experientially  Because I'm still a fuck up  I'm still addicted to porn  I'm still you know  So I'm telling you  Because I know this in my head  But I don't always practice it  And then I have times  Where I'm really good  And I'm fucking you know  Talking  I bumped into somebody yesterday  Outside of my gym  It was a woman  And she goes  Hey didn't I meet you  And it was at a  Let's just say  A place where people  Go for sex addiction  And I wasn't attracted to her  It wasn't like that  But it was a nice little chat  We had  Outside the gym  And I was kind of glad  That I bumped into her 
[03:42:00]  It was like bumping  Into a sober person  So you know  I don't know what you're  What you're really asking  I would just suggest  If it's making your life  Unmanageable  Then five  A twelve step program  Because if you really  Like this girl  You see the writing  On the wall  You're going to fuck up  The relationship  Right and real quick  My last question  Before I let you go  Is you know  Like I said  I'm in the middle  Of nowhere here  And I'm you know  I'm scared  There's not many programs  Up here  I know you can do it online  But you know  People talk about  Going to sex anonymous  Or sex addicts anonymous  And the next thing you know  They fall in love 
[03:42:30]  With somebody who's in there  Because that's what  You're there for  So go to men's meetings  You can go to men's meetings  If you want  And the way  A lot of  I've been to certain meetings  Of a certain  Twelve step meetings  For sex  Let's just say  There's a bunch of sex  Groups  And I've been to  I only went to men's meetings  For a long time  Because I'm like  You know  I don't think that  You know  I don't want to see women there  It's going to be too distracting  And then I went to  And then the place closed  So I went to some women's  Like mixed  And honestly  There was one girl  I was like  Oh she's kind of sexy  But I don't look at them  And just think  Oh god  These girls like to fuck 
[03:43:00]  Because a lot of them  Are love addicts  Or a lot of them  Are what they call  Sexual anorexics  And all this stuff  Like a lot of them  Are not in there  Because they can't stop  Taking dick  Some of them go  Because they fall in love  Immediately  Or they get crazily attached  Or they do things  That would annoy me  Or they're sexually anorexic  And they just don't fuck  Or you know  There's so many weird  Things that drive people in  So I found it  To be very helpful  And when I saw this woman  Yesterday dude  It felt so good  I didn't look at her  Like oh I want to see her tits  I wasn't attracted to her 
[03:43:30]  I was just looking  At kind of another person  Who's an addict  Talking to me  And it was very very helpful  So give it a shot  Were you going to those meetings  While you were in a relationship  Or while you were just  Trying to deal with it  Both  I've done it both  Okay  Okay  Sometimes it's good  If you feel yourself  If you're on a ledge  And you're ready to jump  It's okay to go  And do something to fix that  You don't have to jump  Okay  Hey thank you so much  For your help Jimmy  Okay  I love listening  It's a great  This show is a great alternative  To everything else  That's on radio  And on the internet  And on TV  Thank you so much  Thank you  Uh oh 
[03:44:00]  Uh oh  Pat in Virginia  Uh oh  Hi buddy  Hey Jimmy  My wife is tired of sex  I have a small dick  And she is what?  Well it's not  She's tired of sex  It's that I have a small dick  And I have zero stamina  And my wife  Appreciates that  And likes when I go down on her  But  Hey uh  Hey hold on  Pat  Pat  Not to cut you off  But we can hardly hear you  Because your phone is fucked up  Can you take it off speaker?  Are you on speaker?  No hang on  Let me turn my  Is that better? 
[03:44:30]  Yeah  Yeah  I have my blue tooth on side  No I have no stamina  I last like two minutes  My wife likes when I go down on her  But my wife wants that sex  Yeah  And I can't go long  And I've tried all the tricks  Of hurting me  Like pinching my skin  Or whatever  None of that shit works  And it's you know  Pump in a couple times  And it stops  And do something else  But that'll be a couple seconds  That's not  That's not what her  Either one of us want  I didn't know 
[03:45:00]  If you know  Of any  I don't know  Any supplement  Or something  That could help me  Go fucking longer  Than a minute and a half  Have you tried  Have you tried something like Viagra  If your body's able to take Viagra  That makes it harder to come sometimes  And you might be able to get a rod  After you blow a load  A little bit easier  Or there's those numbing  Go to a porn store  They have those things  That numb your dick a little bit  And you might be able to find  One of those  And use that  Which might help  Go to like a little porn store  And just see if they have anything  That helps keep you from coming 
[03:45:30]  Right  Or have you  Do you jerk off a lot  It comes and goes  Sometimes it'll be  Two, three times a day  Sometimes it'll be  Days in between  Oh wow  And you've practiced edging  Like getting close and stopping  And it doesn't do any good  I've had this problem  Since I started having sex  In my mid-teens  And it's nothing  It's like I'm  I'm cursed with  No dick and no stamina  Wow  Fucking miserable  Well you got a wife dude  It's all you know  I mean look  A lot of guys have  You know that's just not the way  You're going to satisfy a woman 
[03:46:00]  Who needs to be fucked  But how about  Is she okay  If you're using a dildo on her  We've tried that  She's not much into toys  She doesn't mind  When I  You know  When I have like a vibrator  On her clit or something  And I'm in her  But  That's about the extent of it  Yeah I just  I've tried quite a few things  And nothing seems to  And I'm  It's to a point where  I'm getting embarrassed  Of when we have sex  Where I don't want to have sex  Because it's  Alright I gave you my best  And I know  You're just saying  It's okay I don't mind  I know you're fucking lying to me 
[03:46:30]  Not to hurt my feelings  Yeah that's  Huh  And you don't want her  To fuck other people  Obviously  Yeah you don't want to do that  So have you  Can you fuck more than once  That also kind of  Comes and goes  I can finish  And it's like  Wow hey  It's still working  And there's times  Where it's like  As soon as I come  Thinking of sex  Is just like  The most repulsive thing  I'm totally finished  Let's just walk away  Now what  When that happens  Have you been jerking off  A lot 
[03:47:00]  Like if you're on  One of your  Non-jerk-off runs  Do you stay hard after  Like when does that  Happen for you  I couldn't tell you  I'm  It sometimes  Just happens  And sometimes  It just doesn't  I don't know  You know  It might  I can't say  It's because  I didn't jerk off  That day  Or that week  Or whatever  It's just  Sometimes I  You know  I get lucky  My wife gets lucky  I don't know  And you can just  Keep going  Maybe investigate  Viagra or a pill  Like that  Because sometimes  Check for numbing creams  In a porn store 
[03:47:30]  They do sell them  I don't know how well  They work  And try  And see if Viagra  Might help  Even a low dosage  Because they do  Make it harder  For you to come  Like even when I'm  If I'm on a Viagra  I have to really  Like even when I'm  Jerking off  It's much harder  For me to come  So that may help  A little bit  Now Viagra  Is something I had  Thought about  But that's  I'm not  I don't know too much  About that  Still doctor prescribed  Like do I just  Go in and say  Hey I want Viagra  Or like are they  Going to  Like look deeper  Into like  Well what do you  Really want it for  Nah they don't 
[03:48:00]  Just tell them  That your dick is  Like say hey look  Just say look  Hey I'm coming  Really fast  And my dick  Is not as hard  As I want it to be  That's all  Just you know  Bullshit him  And just you know  He'll want to  Check your heart  Probably  And make sure  Your heart's okay  And can take it  But if your heart  Can take it  Just pop one  And see what happens  You make your  Fucking cock  May plump out  A little bit  And you may be  A little bit bigger  And you might be  Able to fuck  A little bit longer  Right  And even if you can't  At least you can  Look at it  And go ah  Look how hard  That is  Let's look how  Hard that is  And I still  Can't do anything  With it  Good luck my friend  I appreciate it 
[03:48:30]  Bye bye  Let's see here  Tom in Brooklyn  Jim what's going on  Hi Tommy  Yeah I got  Just um  I've been on  Pain pills  For years now  Okay  For what  What initially  Started you  A car accident  I hurt my back  Oh okay  And um  I was on it  For like 10 years  Now  I'm 31  And I went to  I went to rehab  I got off everything 
[03:49:00]  And I came back  From rehab  I was clean  For a while  I did the 12  12 step  And everything  Okay  But then  Then I started  Getting back  Into  I started  Smoking dust  A little bit more  I was smoking dust  While I was on  Pain pills  Yeah it's kind of  Hard to smoke dust  Socially  It's very hard  To be a casual  Dust smoker  Yeah you think  Yeah  Like a fucking zombie  Right  So what is your 
[03:49:30]  Question  Because you know  What you have to do  My question is  That because  I  I went back  On the pain pills  Right  And  I don't feel  Like myself  Unless  I don't feel  Comfortable  Around people  Or with people  Unless I'm on  Something  Of course  That's the way  All  Dude that's the way  Tommy  That's the way  All alcoholics  And all drug  Addicts are  We're not comfortable  Unless we're high  Or drunk 
[03:50:00]  That's the problem  That's what it does  Sure  Yeah  Yeah but you know  What it is  It's like  Yes  Like  Like  I'll take the  The pain pills  And I'll be fine  I'll be  I'll be  I'll be able  To hang out  With my family  I'll be able  To hang out  With my friends  But then  When I'm not  When I'm not  Taking the pain pills  Or even Xanax  I take a lot of Xanax  So  When I'm not  Taking Xanax  Or the pain pills 
[03:50:30]  When I'm not  On anything  I can't be around  Anybody  I can't talk to anybody  I just don't feel comfortable  I want to sit in my room  I don't want to do nothing  Now Tommy  When you said to me  You were setting it up  You go  Do you know what it is  I do know what it is  It's  You're a drug addict  Or you sound like one to me  You sound like  No no no  But what I mean is  What I mean is  As a drug addict  We are never comfortable  Unless we're high  When you're active  In an addiction  You're not comfortable  You don't feel right  You don't feel whole  Unless you're under the influence 
[03:51:00]  But that's the  That's the great lie of it  It's a lie  It's convincing you  That you need it  To be yourself  All that shit does  Is mask who you are  And push who you really are  Down deeper  And deeper  And deeper  The scary part  Is when you stop taking it  Well then you're naked  And then all the things  That you don't like  About yourself  Or the things you're afraid of  In life  Or the things that  Hurt you in life  You can't mask them anymore 
[03:51:30]  And there's no hiding  It's like being taken  Out of a dark room  And just thrown naked  Into the middle of a big field  With everybody looking at you  It's like being put on the  50 yard line naked  But the bottom line is  As time goes on  If you get sober  And you do the right thing  All of a sudden  You're very comfortable  On the 50 yard line naked  Because you look out  In the stands  And everybody's naked  And they're all the same as you  None of them are different  That's what getting sober is  Yeah but you know what it is  I've done that  I've done that  I've been clean for a while 
[03:52:00]  Yeah  And I still feel that uncomfortability  So you didn't dig deep enough  You probably did not  Like it's not just about  Putting the substance down  That's a part of it  Yeah  A lot of times  It is about getting to the  The causes deep down  The things that are wrong with me  Inherently deep down  And when people skimp on that work  And they don't do enough  Of that work  And they don't share  With other people  And they don't talk  To other people  And I mean for real  Then that's what happens  They wind up feeling 
[03:52:30]  Unsatisfied  Like hey  Is this all there is  In being sober  And going back out  So what you should realize  Is that you did give it a shot  You put the substance down  At one point  You relapsed  It happens to people  Now you  So now you can go back  You can  You're alive  You didn't die  You're alive  So you can go back  And get whatever it was  You missed the first time  Because that time  You missed something  So now you gotta go back  And get what you missed  And then get on with your life 
[03:53:00]  And stop with fucking angel dust  And all this nonsense  Because you're just gonna die young  And even if you don't die young  You're living in a haze  You're not living for real  You're not living  To have to be fucking high  To talk to anybody  That's not  That's not the way  You wanna live bro  Yeah no of course  I know that  Alright well  I would suggest getting  If you have insurance  And again I suggest  The same thing to people  Because there really is  A very simple solution  It's not easy  But it's simple  Is try to get into a rehab  And at the very least  Talk to people who are sober  And go to a meeting 
[03:53:30]  That's what I would  Find a 12 step group  Of your choosing  Whether it's for alcohol  Or drugs or both  And you know  Begin getting sober  But it is something  You can do Tommy  It's not some impossible task  Okay  Good luck man  And make sure you try it  Alright thank you buddy  Be good  Huh let's see  We got another  Let's go to Chris in Louisiana  Chris in Louisiana  We have a little follow up here  Hey Jimmy how are you  Hey buddy 
[03:54:00]  You called two weeks ago  About sleeping with your friend's  Ex-girl  Was that when he had dated her  For a brief amount of time  And you and her  Were attracted to each other  Right  Okay and I said  That you might want to tell him  Because you guys  Are gonna get more sure  What happened  Exactly  Okay so he gets back from work  I go out to his house  And we have a talk  Told him about it  God has blessings  And we're still together  We're still hanging out  And having a good time  And things look great  Oh good man 
[03:54:30]  So you see  He and her had dated briefly  And it was a little while ago  It wasn't like a real  Real long term relationship  And then you and her  Had some connection  So I think it's better  You told him  Because you were worried  He was gonna find out anyway  Such a load off my back  To have told him  Like that was  That was the only thing  I felt guilty about  Was not  Was the secretive part  Sure sure of course  Well I'm happy you told him  And thanks for the follow up  Man I'm really happy  It worked out Chris  Just wanted to let you know  He's giving good advice  Man  Thanks very much  Take care  And who's a young Dave 
[03:55:00]  From  Let's see  There's two Daves  I want to talk to  We'll talk to Dave  From Arkansas first  The food addict  Hey Jimmy  How are you doing man  I'm good buddy  Thank you  How are you  Hey  You know  In all likelihood  I'm probably a food addict  I'm lucky enough to  I can drink  And I can have one beer  And I have no problem with it  I've been on painkillers  Don't get hooked on them  But the food is one thing  That definitely gets me  That's a tough one yeah  I tried to  I tried to  Go to an  Overview anonymous meeting 
[03:55:30]  And to say it  Bluntly  You know I didn't  It was all  Almost all women  And one  One very very  Office rocker guy  Sure  So I didn't fit in  Or felt like I fit in  At all with the OA meeting  In fact it was  Right  It kind of  I felt like  Kind of like a medium  Sorry  You said you didn't fit in  All right  This is a stupid fact  So  So anyway  So  So you know  I've tried a couple of them  And they're really the same  Because I think  At least women are more  Willing to admit  They have a problem  With food than guys are  So  So 99% of people  That you run into it  At meetings with women 
[03:56:00]  And I just don't relate  To women on that level  At all  Sure  So I was curious  Just to like  And I don't say  I don't  That kind of makes me  Sound like a dick  But I mean  The reasons a woman's  Going to overeat  And the reason I'm  Going to overeat  Are probably completely different  No they're not  They're the same  They're the same  Okay  Here's why  And again that's  None of us are different  When it comes to that  Like there are reasons  That they give  Well my husband  Was this  Or I just had  All day in the house  They may give  Different reasons  But the underlying  Addiction  The underlying  Need to fill the hole 
[03:56:30]  Which is truly  Never fillable  Is the same  And that's why  There's usually  Like when you look  At 12 step programs  Take any one you want to  You know  Fucking hat wearers  Anonymous  There's a set of  12 steps  And 12 traditions  For hat wearers  Anonymous  Otherwise  If we were all  So different and unique  There'd be a different  Book for every one of us  But there's not  There's one set of books  Yeah we have little  Variations here and there  We're all like snowflakes  Blah blah blah  But we're all the same  When it comes to that shit 
[03:57:00]  I've read stuff  In 12 step books  That was written  In the fucking 40s  Which  It nails me  So fucking perfectly  My self centeredness  In the extreme  My self obsession  The fact that I would  Drink or do drugs  When things were good  Or the fact that I would  Do it when things were bad  Like and I'm sure  Food for you  If you read  Whatever that  Overreader Anonymous  12 step book is  If you read that  And read that big book  I think you'll find  Yourself relating  More than you're not  Like they say  Identify don't compare 
[03:57:30]  Well we actually used  That well in the  Meetings I went to  It was reading from  The from the  From the AA big book  So you know  Obviously that  But it was more like  I just didn't relate  To the people in the meeting  You know what I mean  And it you know  If I really do  Trust your advice  If you say  You know if you  Kind of think  I should go back  And then you know  Put all that shit  Behind me that  That like you know  I'm  Then I absolutely will  Because I think  You're spot on  In most of your stuff  But  I think honestly  Not no  I'm sorry to interrupt you  But I don't know  Your case  But I would suggest  The gym  If you're feeling  Like your body's 
[03:58:00]  Not in shape  Maybe the gym  Will help you feel better  And I would suggest  Going to more meetings  And talking in the meeting  About how you feel  I don't feel like  I can relate  Because there's a lot  Of women here  And I feel like  We probably eat  For different reasons  Like just be honest  You don't have to be  Right or wrong  Just be truthful  About how you feel  And you're not judging them  You're a new guy  And like hey look  I don't know how  To feel about this  So it's okay  To feel awkward  Or  Because again  The part of me  That wants to stay sick  And there's a big part of me  Can build in  So many excuses 
[03:58:30]  As to why  I am different  As to why  I don't need to do that  Or why that won't work  For me  Because that little  Sick part of me  Likes to stay  Fucking miserable  And self-loathing  And unhappy  So I have become  A master  At building in  Bullshit  To tell myself  So don't  As they say  Don't listen to yourself  Because you're listening  To an idiot  Listen to other people  Because your best thinking  Got you exactly  Where you are right now  Compulsively overeating  And not sure  What to do about it  So realize that  Other people's thinking 
[03:59:00]  Might be a little bit  Clearer on this  And just give it a shot  Okay  Good luck man  But definitely do it  Because your life  Will change so much  For the better  Okay  Thanks Jimmy  That's great advice  I really appreciate it  Good luck Dave  And let's go to  Young Dave in Memphis  Who's another cheater  He's always cheated  And his current girlfriend  Is what  I couldn't read  The rest of that  Oh you're swingers  Okay  Yeah Jimmy Norton  How you doing brother  Hi buddy  My whole thing  Real quick  With the whole cheating  Part of it  My whole thing 
[03:59:30]  I'm 41  And my whole thing  It's an ego thing  Knowing that I'm  41 years old  And I can  I can still bang  A 23  24 year old  I can sit there  And say to myself  I'm like you know what  I still fucking got it  You know what I mean  But my chick  My chick  Is freaking awesome  You know she's  The greatest chick  In the world  It's just an ego  Thing for me  But anyway  So what are you saying  You still  What's your question  You still cheat on her  Or you want to cheat on her  Well I don't anymore 
[04:00:00]  Because actually  We had to move away  From the area  Because it got way too bad  So  Okay  She moved back home  To where she's  Originally from  I love her  So I followed her  Just to prove to her  I wouldn't cheat on her  Anymore  Okay  But the whole  Swinging thing  Man check this out  We've been to a  Swingers club in Dallas  She's made out with chicks  You know  Chicks that suck her tits  And all that  Right  So I'm trying to get her  To you know  Into the next level 
[04:00:30]  Of this whole thing  But we talk about it  You know  She's into it  She really wants to do it  It's a fantasy of hers  You know  To be two guys  You know  And all that other stuff  But it always comes back  To her wanting me  You know  To suck his dick  And all this other stuff  You know  When we talk about it  You know  It's pretty hot  She gets into it  You know  Because she's a little freak  When we talk about it  Right  So I go along with it  But I really don't know  How to tell her 
[04:01:00]  I'm really not going to  Suck some other  Dude's dick  Well you know  Again  You don't have to go through  With it  We've all said things  In fantasy  That were just fantasy  And you could tell her  For real  And don't tell her  Tell her in a non-sexual moment  Like you don't want to  You don't ever want to  Scold somebody sexually  Like if she's like  Yeah you'll suck his cock  You don't want to go  Well you know  All kidding aside  Tell her after  Like you know  I really don't know  If I could do that  It's fantasy  Because she may not  Really want to see you do that  Or maybe she's just  Mad at you for cheating  She's like  Yeah I'm going to  Stick a cock in this guy's mouth  And then dump him 
[04:01:30]  Well see  And that's  You know I like  You know I like  My ass played with  You know  She wears a strap on  You know  So I'll suck it for her  I'll let her  You know I'll let her  Fuck my ass  Yeah you're a good guy  But you know  But her knowing  That part of it  I think  She really thinks  That I want to be  You know  I would be with another dude  And I really don't know  If I could do that for her  Right  You know what I mean  Well don't do it  If you don't want to man  You know  Because you can't  You can't take it back  You know  Once you pop one 
[04:02:00]  In your fucking gullet  You can't  Never unpop it  So you think  Just talking to her  Like out to dinner  Say you know what baby  You know I love the fact  That you love it  But I don't know  If I could really do that  I'll still suck your strap on  You know  But other than that  Or you could say  Look we could have a threesome  But I won't suck his dick  The first time  Like just see how she reacts  To that  Like you don't have to  Again you don't  Don't have to  Break the fantasy totally  But are you actually  Going to hook up  With another guy  You may just keep it  As fantasy 
[04:02:30]  Yeah well I mean  You know she really  Wants to do it  You know like I said  We've been to that  Swingers club before  And you know  The opportunity  Really wasn't there  For another dude  But I mean she really  Wants to do it  And I think it's  Fucking hot anyway  You know  Tell her that the first  Time you wouldn't  Say the first time  I just want to watch you  You know talk to her  Like that and see that  And she may be fine  With that  But if she gets down  To it and she's like  No it's important to me  That you do this  Then you might have to  Go like look sweetheart  I gotta tell you  You know I can't  Suck a dick  Yeah 
[04:03:00]  Alright  Alright Jimmy  I appreciate it  Good luck my friend  Later  Now we had  There was a guy here  That wanted to  Someone said  Al from Boston  Is a simple solution  Now is this a silly solution  Or a real solution  Yes  Hey hello Jimmy  Yeah you have a cure  For the guy  Because we're running  Out of time  So you have a cure  For the guy  Who comes quickly  Yeah I'll make it quick  This is a real  The real deal man  And I'll tell you  Something  Myself had suffered  With it  And I  Really all it comes 
[04:03:30]  Down to is  Using like an  SSRI type medication  Like a Zoloft  Or a Prozac  And one of the  Unwanted side effects  Of those drugs  Is that  It does delay  It does delay  Ejaculation  So for some men  You know it actually  Can be a problem  You know not being  Able to come  Right right sure  Like a low dose  SSRI  Like a 50 milligram  Tablet  And then you know  And then you combine  That with like a  Cialis or a Viagra  It's amazing 
[04:04:00]  Because it'll delay  The ejaculation  But it also  You know  Allow the person  To you know  Have sex  So it's a simple thing  Have them talk to  Your doctor about it  And usually it works  For most people  Thank you very much  For the call  That was very helpful  Yeah you gotta find  The right dose though  Because sometimes  You know you gotta  Find that key  Like a low dose  And work your way up  Until you have  That perfect combination  Thank you very much  That sounds like  A great idea  Cool  Thank you  And Jeff in Lexington  Feeling a little sad  Or possibly going  Through a midlife crisis  Hey Jimmy 
[04:04:30]  Hello Jeff  I love your show  Thank you sir  Yeah man  I don't  I'm just  Really unhappy  And I feel like  I'm kind of  In a downward spiral  I'm stuck  In a dead end job  And I'm probably  What you would call  A functional alcoholic  How old  The guy are you  I'm 41  Okay  Married  Two kids  Great kids  Great wife  Great family life  But there's just  Something unfulfilled  In my life  And I don't really know  I recognize 
[04:05:00]  What's going on  In my life  But I don't know  What the first step is  To try to fix the problem  I don't know  If it's depression  I don't know  If it's a midlife crisis  I don't  I don't know  Who I should talk to  Well I think that  If you said something  That you might be  A functional alcoholic  To me that's the most  Important thing you said  Because when you look  At like  It's hard to look  At things rationally  When we're bummed out  Or shitty  But you have a good wife  You have good kids  So there's  The most important things 
[04:05:30]  In your life  Are good  The job you may not like  But jobs are changeable  Maybe your job is not  But I think most jobs  If you responsibly  Can kind of go  From one job to another  Can be changed  And being the  Functional alcoholic  I think the alcoholic  Is the key  To at least beginning  To get you back  To feeling really good  Or where you should be  Because that's  Probably what is  Contributing a great deal  To your feeling sad  Depressed  You're a functional alcoholic  Yeah  You know 
[04:06:00]  I drink  Every night  I don't miss work  Because of it  I don't usually  Feel bad  In the mornings  But you know  By 6 o'clock  Man I'm ready  For a beer  So yeah  So you know  What your problem is  That's probably  What it is  And maybe there's  Depression and other  Stuff with it  But that's the  Biggest piece  Of the puzzle  Right there  Is you need  To address  The fact that  You're an alcoholic  And you need  To do something  About it  Not just say it  To yourself  And not just  Know it in your head  But you know  Get sober  Or begin to do it 
[04:06:30]  We have a lot  Of calls today  Of people who need  To get sober  That is  It's not the key  To everything  Being perfect  But it's a huge  Step  In making life  Good  In making life  Palatable  And acceptable  And then even  After that  Not too bad  And then very good  You know  It's a step  In the right direction  But I would suggest  Getting sober  First and foremost  And I think  The other stuff  Will become  A little bit better  Than you think  It will automatically  Yeah  Yeah I've  Wanted to quit  Drinking for a long  Time and I've  Tried several times 
[04:07:00]  And I always just  You know  Fall off the wagon  And go right back  To it  So maybe I should  Seek you know  A 12 step program  Or some other  Kind of help  Yeah I think  You definitely should  And this time  Don't fall off the wagon  This time actually  Go through with it  And realize that  You're doing something  That's going to  Make the rest of your life  Dude your life  Can maybe just be  Half over  Like you may live  To be 86  You're 41  Like you may  Technically  Midlife crisis  Where you know  Guys who are 65  Would have when  They were 40  They were way past  The midlife  But we live a lot  Longer these days 
[04:07:30]  So you could have  Years and years  And years left  So don't fucking  Do it depressed  You got years left  You know  With the way  Medicine is changing  You might live to be 90  So what  You know  You could have  50 fucking years left  Okay man  All right  So get sober  I appreciate your help  All right  We'll try  Okay my friend  We have to do a quick round  Because we're wrapping up  I apologize to those  I didn't get to  I wanted to get to  All of you  Let's see  I saw Jim last night  He was fantastic  You're right  I was  Thanks a lot  For being there  If these women 
[04:08:00]  Really cared about  Porn stars  What's that Iraq  And Amanda  I didn't know  If they cared about  Porn stars  They called in earlier  They would have  Sucked his dick  Oh  Hi Amanda  Hold on  We'll put her on  I didn't realize  I didn't realize  There was a girl  We have to go soon  You like that porn star  No  Not really  These women  That don't want to  Take care of their  Men's sexual needs  That's bullshit  If they really cared  About them  They wouldn't care  What they look like  Their past  Or anything  That's bullshit  Right  You think they're just  Excuses  Yes it is 
[04:08:30]  It's bullshit  The guy having trouble  Keeping it up  And being small  There's exercises online  That can fix that  Without a pill  Or anything  Okay  And they can increase  His size  Make him last longer  And also  If he  Diabetes  That could cause  All those problems  Dave in Arkansas  With the trouble eating  Drink one to two  Glasses of water  Before you eat  You won't eat as much  Because you'll be full  There's also a medicine  Called Xenermine  It's drastically  Curves your appetite  I lost 14 pounds
