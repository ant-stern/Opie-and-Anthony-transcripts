<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heated post-mortem of the 2012 Presidential debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.  Opie and Anthony, along with possibly E-Roc, heavily criticized debate moderator Candy Crowley, using highly offensive language to describe her perceived bias toward Obama and factual inaccuracies regarding the Benghazi attack.  They dissected the candidates' performances, focusing on their responses to questions about the economy, foreign policy, and energy, and criticizing the town hall format.  The segment included numerous listener calls, some of which devolved into lengthy, contentious arguments with the hosts about taxation, the Founding Fathers, and the fairness of the American political system.  These calls, along to some degree the hosts themselves, frequently utilized offensive language. A brief discussion about the Yankees' playoff performance was also included, and the hosts mentioned a simulcast from a location near the debate.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of the New York Yankees' poor ALCS performance, focusing on Alex Rodriguez's perceived lack of effort and off-field behavior, described with offensive terms like "scumbag" and accusations of "flirting".  Trump's suggestion to terminate A-Rod's contract was also addressed.  This segment included a listener jingle contest featuring humorous and often vulgar entries.  Other topics covered included Apple's iPad Mini, the NHL lockout, the upcoming presidential election (touching upon wealth inequality and corporate greed), unions (including negative personal experiences), and the balance between business risk and employee compensation.  The hosts also briefly discussed Rory Kennedy's HBO documentary on Ethel Kennedy, Taylor Swift's relationship with a Kennedy, and the appropriateness of Beyoncé's Super Bowl performance, all in a typically crude and offensive manner.

Next, the show opened with a discussion of Beyoncé and Madonna's Super Bowl performances, which segued into a revelation about the Rolling Stones' "Waiting on a Friend" video, identified by the hosts and guest Sam Roberts as featuring the same building as Led Zeppelin's *Physical Graffiti* album cover.  This led to a tangent involving a tweet and the website FeelNumb.com.  The conversation then shifted to the hosts' musical preferences, with Sam mentioning White Zombie and Aerosmith's *Permanent Vacation*.

The bulk of this segment was dedicated to "Jack-tober," a recurring segment where Opie and Anthony criticized the Kane Show on Hot 99.5.  They played clips from the Kane Show, criticizing its content and hosts,  particularly a bit they had previously advised against.  They also discussed a local news story involving a teacher and a student. The hosts’ commentary was heavily laden with profanity and sexually explicit remarks.  They reacted with disgust to graphic and offensive images and statements from the Kane Show's Facebook page and live chat, including altered images of themselves.  They also conducted a "Kane Scam," a prank call involving sexually suggestive language. This segment continued to feature offensive and vulgar comments from the Kane Show's chat room.  Rory Kennedy was interviewed briefly during this segment about her documentary, before the hosts concluded by discussing the Kane Show’s Facebook post reacting to being featured on Jack-tober.

A subsequent segment featured a longer interview with Rory Kennedy about her documentary "Ethel."  She discussed her family's experiences, including the assassinations of her father and uncle, the challenges and privileges of being a Kennedy, Ethel Kennedy's activism, her relationship with J. Edgar Hoover, and her views on current politics, praising Obama. The hosts and Rory discussed home footage from the documentary, including a humorous anecdote about a note from Ethel Kennedy to J. Edgar Hoover suggesting his replacement.  Following the interview, the hosts shared their reactions, making jokes, including one host blatantly lying to support Obama. The segment concluded with listener-submitted jingles for a contest and a promotion for Jimmy Norton's comedy shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Morning!  Oh my goodness gracious.  Yeah.  Hi there.  There's everybody.  There they all are.  Where, where, where, where, where?  Oh, they're out there.  They're out there.  Everyone a little sleepy? 
[00:00:30]  They're out there hating and loving.  Yes.  And trying to decide on who to vote for the president of the United States of America.  Yes.  Decision 2012.  Those wishy-washy assholes.  The attention whore fucking undecideds.  Oh, God.  It's about me.  I'm undecided.  Try to get me.  You're talking to me.  Me.  Just flip a fucking coin at this point. 
[00:01:00]  They're pulling me.  What else do you need to know?  Yeah.  They put him on a pedestal, though.  The undecided voter.  Oh, yeah.  Must be the most informed person in America.  They want them, boy.  They want the undecided.  Oh, my God.  I've decided it's all bullshit.  It's all horseshit, man.  Man.  Man.  Well, we're in a bit of a disagreement here.  I did think that Obama won the debate by not that much. 
[00:01:30]  I think Romney won the first debate by a lot.  And I think Obama won last night.  But it was very close.  It was closer than the first debate.  But Anthony certainly is going to say the opposite.  As I see it, I didn't see any clear-cut winner or loser last night.  I think that people are assuming Obama won because it's based on a comparison to the last debate,  which was such an abomination for him, that he just kind of came off looking better.  So he came off looking better. 
[00:02:00]  He came back strong last night.  And it's a different format.  It's that stupid wander around looking at these Long Island fucking pieces of shit with their horrible access.  Governor Romney, my daughter goes to college.  What about the Rosie Perez brought?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was thinking to myself, does her vote even count?  What?  We need more money to go to.  It was that town hall shit. 
[00:02:30]  B minus to a C. MSNBC gives it to Obama.  Of course they do.  That's surprising.  They're usually very fair.  But Fox called it a tie, and you know what that means.  Yeah.  That means that Obama won slightly.  Oh, boy.  You know how that works.  Oh, boy.  I saw a lot of polls on the different demographics of the debate.  Oh, really?  Well, no, different subject matter and stuff.  On the economy, they said that Romney won that one.  Foreign Affairs, it looked like Obama came across looking better. 
[00:03:00]  But that fucking Candy Crowley fucked up and had said that Obama did indeed call the Libyan attack terrorism the next day in the Rose Garden.  He didn't.  He didn't.  He was talking about how America will not back down to terror.  What was the exact quote?  What is the exact quote?  Let's find it.  I'll paraphrase good enough. 
[00:03:30]  I heard that on the radio at live while it was happening.  That fucking bitch interjected and was wrong?  And was fucking wrong.  Oh, she stinks.  Obama was on stage last night trying to say that he did indeed call the Benghazi attack an act of terror.  No, he didn't.  That's the big fucking thing.  They kept blaming it on that God fucking videotape, that YouTube thing, when indeed it was an act of terror that was planned and carried out as a September 11th fucking anniversary act of terror. 
[00:04:00]  I believe she admitted she was wrong now that I look at that.  After the fucking debate's over?  Well, what are you going to do?  That fucking twat.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Don't worry.  People will get the memo.  She was absolutely biased.  The memo's in their inboxes.  Don't worry.  Oh, please.  That she was wrong.  She was baiting Obama with questions based on what Romney said.  So Romney would say something.  Her as a reporter gets what Romney says.  And then the next kind of question, or when she's telling Obama it's his turn, she'd throw words in to make Obama think like, oh, he did say that. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I got it.  Nine more minutes, too.  Nine more minutes, also.  That fat bitch cunt.  Oh, do I hate Monica Crowley.  Fucking Monica Crowley.  I hate her turn.  Relax.  Candy Crowley.  Relax.  A lot of people are very mad that there were a lot of fat jokes on Twitter last night.  Not just from me.  Pretty much everyone was going with the fat angle.  It was too easy.  Candy Crowley. 
[00:05:00]  First of all, I don't know why she was wearing makeup and got her hair all rolled out.  Oh, my God.  It was horrifying.  Oh, that bitch.  And I don't understand why you need a moderator when these guys are going at it.  Every time it got good and these guys were like toe to toe where you were convinced that some shit was going down.  Right.  She had to jump in like a stupid high school teacher.  Who gives a fuck if you're not going to get to all your questions?  That's what the American people want to see.  These two guys being combative and how they handle themselves. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Exactly.  Is one going to lose their fucking shit?  Is another guy going to be calm and cool and be able to still answer the question even though they're arguing back and forth?  And then she jumps in like, well, you'll have your time.  You'll have your time, Mr. President.  She was terrible.  Yeah.  But they all do that.  They all do that.  When the shit gets going and it gets good, let them just go.  Who gives a fuck if you got to X out a bunch of questions you're not going to get to?  Yeah.  Fuck, that was so frustrating.  It really was.  Yep. 
[00:06:00]  It really was.  Because now you've got two powerful guys going at it.  How do they handle themselves?  Exactly.  Well, I'm guilty of the same thing, as a matter of fact.  What do you mean?  Well, I did do a simulcast from the compound last night.  Which means you don't even know who won because you were too busy talking throughout the entire debate, sir.  That's what people said, but that's not true.  I was listening.  You were multitasking?  I commented on what was going on as it was going on.  But I was listening indeed.  But there was a point where when they were fighting, I literally was between the two, pushing them apart. 
[00:06:30]  Good for you.  I caught for green screen.  It's hilarious.  That must have been funny.  That was very fun.  I was pushing them apart while they were getting together.  Ready to brawl.  I wanted to see them fucking start yelling at each other, though.  The whole country wanted to see that.  And I don't get it.  I just don't understand why Kenny Crowley has to jump in.  She was terrible.  Because they're still trying to make their points.  Right.  They're not going down to mama jokes or anything like that. 
[00:07:00]  They're still trying to get their point across.  But it's more aggressive and combative.  That's great.  Yeah.  Instead of the dumb questions that the Long Islanders were asking.  And then...  Yeah, but those questions, you know, they didn't just pull them out of the fucking thin air.  Pull them out of their ass?  Of course not.  They knew exactly every question that was going to be asked.  Of course they did.  Yeah.  But they were asking the questions.  And then both of them, Romney and Obama, just don't answer. 
[00:07:30]  I mean, it's been out for years.  Of course not.  That's why you let them go.  Right.  Because in the end, they're not answering any questions.  You're right, Anthony.  Because someone will say something, and the other guy goes, whoa, hold on.  I've got to respond to that.  Well, you don't have your time.  A prime example of that last night was the last guy that asked a question.  And he said, and he was like, well, I've got a very complicated question for you.  Like, he thinks he's got the question.  Of course.  That guy was so annoying.  He was like, well, strap in, because here comes the question of the evening. 
[00:08:00]  And he was asking, what misconceptions do people have about you as a candidate?  Which is a pretty good question, I guess.  Yeah, but Jesus Christ, he thought he was fucking Barbara Walters, this guy.  I know, I know.  What misconceptions do you have?  If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?  As a candidate, what kind of misconceptions do people have about you that has been maybe  lies or mistruths, whatever you want to call them, throughout the campaign?  And all it turned into was both candidates crowing about themselves.  It wasn't the misconceptions anymore. 
[00:08:30]  I know.  It was, I do this, I do that.  It's like, no, that's not the answer to the question.  And that's when that stupid, fat bitch should pop her dumb skull in there and go, whoa,  you're not answering the question.  Right.  That's what a good moderator does.  Yeah, she was terrible.  That's when you should jump in.  But when these guys are going at it, back and forth, shut your fucking mouth.  Let them roll.  You're just a stupid CNN reporter in the end.  And you're telling these two powerful guys, you know, you're trying to control two powerful  guys.  Let them rock.  Let them rock.  I'm so annoyed she was wrong about that. 
[00:09:00]  Because I heard that last night.  That was on wind.  I was listening while I was driving home.  And then she said, no, no, no, he did say terrorism or whatever.  So I'm like, all right, maybe he did.  And then I didn't remember because I thought Romney was right.  He just said, all he said, what a fucking blunder.  All Obama said was that America won't, you know, bow down or whatever to terror.  To terror.  Not this is terrorism.  Yeah.  He was making a blanket statement about any violence that would happen.  No, here's what he said. 
[00:09:30]  No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character  or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.  That's a blanket statement about violence against this nation, not what they were consistently  saying about Benghazi, which was that it was a response to that YouTube video.  So that when Romney said that they hadn't come out and said it was terror for a week 
[00:10:00]  after, he was correct.  And Crowley turns around and goes, no, no, he did say.  No, he didn't.  Stop it.  And don't try to twist it around and piss down my back and tell me it's raining.  And that's not her job.  That's not her job.  No.  To back up either candidate there.  It's not her job.  Exactly.  If they fuck up what they're saying, so be it.  We'll all know in the end.  She doesn't have to pipe in.  God, she was so annoying.  She was terrible. 
[00:10:30]  And I'm sure she'll get her props today.  Of course.  For being a strong woman that kept everything under control.  Yeah, made it kind of boring, to be honest with you.  Screw her.  Oh, God.  Oh, she was terrible.  Oh, God.  But those people asking the questions weren't so.  Oh.  Hello?  President Obama.  Obama.  Obama?  I want to ask you a question.  My daughter is going to college, and we need to know the money's going to be there. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, just seeing those Long Islanders.  They try to overthink these debates.  They're the star.  Making it a little showy.  They're the stars.  Because they're not.  But they're not the stars.  Because I'm sure if they were allowed, they would ask different questions.  Yeah.  Every question's looked at.  All right, we'll allow you to ask this question.  It's all bullshit in the end. 
[00:11:30]  Well, how about Obama didn't really get, I guess, the one foreign policy question about Libya that the guy threw out was kind of a, hey, we'll get Obama with this one.  And then that woman that asked Romney about, compare himself to George Bush.  George Bush ain't running for fucking president, dummy.  That was kind of dumb.  And what else annoys me about this whole George Bush, Romney fucking Obama inheriting George Bush.  George Bush was a wartime president.  Let's fucking be honest here.  We were at war during those fucking years that he was in there. 
[00:12:00]  Still at war.  But that's when it started.  You have to make certain concessions in this country when we're at war.  And as far as spending money to fight a war, you have to do it.  It's unfortunate.  It takes away from things.  It builds up a deficit.  But there wasn't many Americans that were crying about the fact that we had to go to war. 
[00:12:30]  Everyone remembers what it was like on 9-11, but then time goes by and people start forgetting.  We were at war.  He was a wartime president.  That's why we have elections every four years.  That's why there's term limits.  Certain presidents are good for certain jobs.  And it's dictated by the times.  When you have a war going on, 9-11, 2001, you need a president that can fight a war that's good with foreign policy.  That is tough.  And economically, we might not do very well during those years. 
[00:13:00]  Afterwards, we need an economic president.  A president that's good with business, with numbers.  Sorry, that's Mitt Romney at this point.  Mitt Romney knows a lot more about business and about making some of the hard decisions that have to be made to get this country back in a sound economic standing.  And then four more years from now, it might be something else.  But you can't base what you want to elect a president on based on the last president.  Of course.  Or maybe in four years what it's going to be. 
[00:13:30]  You've got to think now.  Right now, it's about the economy.  And Obama has not proven that he can handle this fucking economy.  It was one dumb question.  Of course you're right.  And Romney handled himself as far as answering that question.  He made it very obvious that he's a very different guy than Bush.  Yes.  The only thing I thought Obama did good was in the oil question.  I thought in the oil drilling question, he did very well.  You think?  Yeah, because I didn't know the answer to that.  Offshore, how come we're not drilling on, I think, state-owned?  Yeah.  And it sounded like Romney nailed him, and Obama was like, no, that was because we didn't take away all of these permits to drill. 
[00:14:00]  We said you have to use it, you have to drill now, or we're going to take it.  Because this is taxpayer land.  You can't just sit on it for 20 or 30 years until you're ready to make a bigger profit.  Well, we need you to drill now or don't drill.  All right.  Well, then Romney's response was cut off by FATSO.  Yeah.  Well, Romney also had a good response to that, no matter what Obama said.  He said, look at the price of energy.  Not just gas.  The price of energy. 
[00:14:30]  And, yes, look at gas.  Why the fuck are we paying so much for gas if we're drilling and refineries are being licensed?  Again, the Keystone Pipeline, he put the kibosh on that.  Why?  And even Romney said, I can't think of why a president would do that, would not go through with this pipeline.  And Obama didn't have an answer for that.  He goes, well, we've put down a lot of pipelines.  Oh, really?  That would have made jobs, would have brought fuel into the country.  And he's talking about new energy, solar, wind. 
[00:15:00]  That's all fine and well.  But this world runs on oil right now.  So we need to fucking use it.  This guy, he's not the president we need right now.  Sorry.  And his record is four years, and he hasn't done the job.  He said he was going to do the job.  He didn't do the job.  Why is he being allowed another four years?  Well, the voters will decide that. 
[00:15:30]  They will.  The undecideds.  They absolutely will.  Oh, then the hot chick came up and started babbling about something.  What's this bitch saying?  She was, yeah, back that up a little bit.  Back that ass.  I mean, back that up.  And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got it.  Sacrifices.  Five trillion.  That's foreign.  Instead, he's doubled.  What happened?  Almost 20.  You lost her.  Find her.  God, are you terrible at that?  I'm trying to rewind it.  No, you've just got to get to the point where she's asking the question. 
[00:16:00]  This is the previous question.  So we fixed that.  Oh, my God, Travis.  What are you doing?  You're like Sam, but not quite as bad.  Where is she?  We lost her.  Where is she?  You lost her.  You had her.  Get her back.  We want her.  Yeah, but the video's really long, so it's really hard to navigate it.  Oh, God, but you had it.  Oh, Travis stinks at this.  She was right there, and you just blew her away.  Oh, now there's some other way. 
[00:16:30]  That's the only prize.  No.  Hang on.  I'll find her.  You had her.  I know I had her, but I wanted to rewind it a little so you could listen to her.  She doesn't ask a follow-up.  If you had it, you had the beginning question.  Did you see that moment where the guy whose name was Kerry and Obama was a little confused,  and I don't blame him because he was expecting a girl?  Yeah.  Okay, did it.  Oh, here she is.  We'll get to Kerry in a minute.  Specifically regarding females making only 72% of what their male counterparts earn.  Good. 
[00:17:00]  Well, Catherine, this is a great question.  Yeah, how about you cover up your cleavage, and then we can talk.  Of course you were raised by a single mom.  Your dad was a piece of shit.  Whoa.  Yeah, he was kind of a dick, his father.  Oh, what an asshole.  He made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got...  Dreams from my father.  Dreams of my father.  Dreams with my father.  She started off...  Dreams of his father.  Every book should have been about liquor.  Yeah.  His father drank a lot of...  And bitches.  Even though she was smart as a whip, and...  And now we're just answering... 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, I just wanted to see her...  Ask her a question.  That's right.  It was her fucking glass ceiling.  Well, just look at the White House staff.  Women make less money in Obama's White House than the men.  You can't have...  Yes, they do.  Yes, they do.  You can't have equal pay if you're showing off cleavage.  Period.  I agree.  No one's going to fully respect you.  These broads got to fucking realize.  And then you march into that office and tell the boss, I covered up my cleavage.  I should get paid like a man.  That's how I would answer that shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Hi, Kerry.  Yeah, thanks.  Stop Sam.  Yorktown, Virginia.  Yeah.  So they go, the next question's from Kerry.  And Obama got a little flustered because he's expecting a woman to stand up and it's this guy.  Yeah.  Whoops.  What else about this nonsense?  Well, it was very heated and what a divided nation we're in.  That's so stupid.  It really is very, very divided these days.  In the end, we're just fucking ourselves. 
[00:18:30]  Because no one wants to acknowledge the other side.  No one wants to work with the other side.  My side's the best side.  Blah, blah, blah.  Well, the ideology has gotten so different with the two parties that it's very hard to come together on anything these days.  No one wants to work with the other party because then if the other party looks good, then they trash you and try to show how great they did.  I think our system is pretty broke.  Yeah.  I think it's broke right now. 
[00:19:00]  It's busted.  It's like the Yankees all busted up.  So whoever gets in there, the other side's going to refuse to acknowledge that that guy could do anything.  So then it'll be another four years ago, well, we've got to fucking knock this guy down so we can possibly get our guy in.  Yeah.  It's broke, man.  Why would you help him get a leg up and do something that he can use in the next election?  I did this.  I did that.  I did this.  It's like, well, I helped you do that.  We agreed to do this.  That won't get across in the election.  So why would you help a guy when he's just going to turn around and use it against you? 
[00:19:30]  And I'm talking both sides on that one.  How do we change that?  Term limits would certainly help getting some of these politicians out of there, these lifetime politicians.  Yeah, well, I don't know.  Yeah, there's a term limit on presidents, but not Congress or something, right?  Yeah, Congress.  They've got big, fat careers.  I'd love term limits on there.  That'd be good.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think that's the way it was supposed to be.  You're not supposed to have guys fucking reciting in there for life. 
[00:20:00]  Because they become too powerful.  They become very powerful.  They make their friends.  They make their buddies.  They cater to their friends in their states.  They forge alliances.  Yes.  You know, I noticed something last night during the debate.  You know, that stupid graphic thing with the undecideds when they were talking?  You see the...  Yeah, yeah.  I noticed every time, and it didn't happen a lot, every time one of these guys had a bit  of honesty, where it wasn't rah, rah, rah, where they're like, well, yeah, you know, 
[00:20:30]  we've made tough decisions, but...  Right down, right?  Right down.  The public does not want honesty.  And that's what frustrates me, because I would love a candidate that just flat out is honest.  But every time these guys showed a little glimpse of that, I watched that line, and it would  go below sea level.  No one wants to hear fucking honesty.  They want that, rah, rah, rah, you're the greatest thing ever, and you're perfect, and  blah, blah, blah, everything's going to be great if I'm the President of the United States. 
[00:21:00]  Yep.  Holy fuck.  I'm reading down here, of course, well, all politicians seem to lie, but Romney seems to  lie more.  Really?  More than Obama.  Obama lies on every bit of his record the past four years.  When he talks about all these jobs that he made, just stop it.  Stop.  He's talking about jobs that were made while more jobs were lost.  I cannot sit here and say, hey, let's say I go to fucking a casino. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, Anthony, how'd you do at the casino?  Fuck, man.  I won $5,000.  Nice.  Wow, great.  Oh, that's right.  I bet $10,000 to win it.  But I won $5,000.  Would you sit there and go, wow, that was good.  You won $5,000.  That's exactly what Obama's doing when he talks about these unemployment numbers.  But you're still sitting.  What?  You said I can't sit here.  Oh, I know.  Well, I'll manage.  I'll manage to just sit.  No, you should have stood. 
[00:22:00]  I should have stood up.  Yeah.  Damn it.  I don't know how to make a point.  I'm just trying to keep it a little fun.  Just a little.  Oh, please.  How was Chris Matthews?  Did you take a peek?  Oh, gee.  What an amazing display by Obama.  He just totaled him.  It was a knockout blow.  A knockout blow.  Fantastic performance.  Romney looked like a blithering idiot.  Here's a hairbrush, Chris.  Holy shit.  Look at my hair.  Here's a hairbrush.  Give me some spray for men. 
[00:22:30]  I don't care what women's hairspray.  My hair's going crazy.  Why don't we go to the people?  You got a comment on the debate?  Please give us a call.  We haven't done a phone thing in a while.  No names on the phones today?  Oh, jeez.  Who's on the phones here?  Are you rocking it?  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  They're all in here.  We see everything.  We got a phone.  What?  All right.  Then it's a Mars problem.  You see everything.  Mars?  Hi, who's this?  Far away.  All right.  Hi, who's this? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I promised myself I wouldn't bitch since signing the new deal.  That's all right.  You know what?  We'll try the next line.  No, no, man.  It's the phones.  You know what, though?  It's not a topic that really the people want to talk about.  That's not true.  They do.  Oh, Jimmy.  The one day we actually need the phones again are going to the phones.  And this.  It'll be fixed.  One push of the button.  E-Roc's got magic.  E-Roc's got it.  Look at him.  E-Roc, is Mars here today?  He's going to desktop director.  He's going to studio.  You did a good job moderating. 
[00:23:30]  He's going to.  Oh, boy.  He's just going between two things without really clicking.  Are you guessing?  Is this guesswork?  Yeah.  I think Anthony is wrong about the debate.  Perfect.  I'm going to that one first.  Yes.  Please.  No, I'll go from the top to the bottom so we're not influenced.  Okay.  Let's start with this guy.  Line one, what's your name?  Jim.  Hi, Jim.  What do you got?  That's my name, too.  Jim. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Hey, I was calling to talk about the debate.  Did you notice when Romney asked Obama about his investments in China and his 401k or whatever  he had there?  Yeah.  It kind of just barreled right over him?  Yeah, he didn't want to acknowledge it.  He was talking about how Romney has invested in businesses in China.  Well, I think there's a balancing act you've got to do there.  If you're just investing in companies that are taking jobs away from this country, based 
[00:24:30]  on, of course, again, us outbidding ourselves out of fucking keeping jobs in this country  because of unions.  But I digress.  When you invest in companies in China, it's not a bad thing.  I mean, you've got to do business with the rest of the world.  That's the place we're living in.  So they're trying to make it sound like Romney is just investing in China. 
[00:25:00]  Well, Obama has some of his investments in China.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  But he didn't want to acknowledge it.  But Obama slapped Romney pretty good.  He said, you can't handle China.  What was the exact quote about China?  Yeah, he'll handle China.  That's a clip you should have got, Sam.  I just liked when he said, do you have a bigger pension than I do?  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  Oh, he nailed him, all right.  Wow, I'm a successful guy.  Holy shit.  What a scumbag dick fuck I am.  Yeah, but it's coming from Obama, who's a multimillionaire as well. 
[00:25:30]  Exactly.  And after the presidency, who will fucking get millions upon millions of dollars to speak.  He's acting like he's me and you.  Obama's a middle class guy.  I thought Romney had a good answer to China.  He said that they are manipulators of their currency.  I thought he had a really good answer for China.  Oh, yeah.  And he said he'd deal with them if he gets in office.  It's probably better than Obama is, that's for sure.  Can you find the China quote?  It's pretty good.  I'm sure it's up there somewhere.  Hey, thank you, sir.  I think Obama said, look, you'll never guess what they're going to do to your Coke. 
[00:26:00]  Let's go to the next guy.  Hi, who's this?  Hi.  Hi.  This is Chris, the teacher from SP1.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, guys.  It's been a while.  I hope you're doing good.  Congratulations.  Thanks.  Great, great, great.  Thank you.  That was for me.  Nice with it.  How do you do this?  That was for me.  And I have a couple of questions, Professor.  Yeah.  First, people, and I'm a horrible conservative, but people seem to get really upset about what  Romney said about the gas prices on Long Island, how he said they were $1.86 a gallon when 
[00:26:30]  Obama took office.  Uh-huh.  They were.  And everybody's saying how crazy.  I looked.  I did some heavy Googling.  Yep.  And they were.  You sure?  What the fuck?  You sure they were?  Because people are saying they weren't.  They were.  Give me a little info on that.  You asking me?  No, not you, sir.  You're supposed to just relax and eat your egg sandwich.  I got a little graph right in front of me here. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  Anyway, go ahead, Chris.  Sorry.  I got a little graph right in front of me.  It says $1.86 on New Year's Eve of 2008, and then the high point was in 2011 at $4.32.  I'm not going to bore you with statistics.  And then-  But when is the president-  Hold on, hold on.  When does the president take office?  I know we're-  I know it's-  2008.  No, in February, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So what were the gas prices in February?  You know there's that lame duck shit.  Good question. 
[00:27:30]  It was $2.01.  All right.  That's different than $1.86.  I agree.  It ain't no $4 and change.  That's for fucking sure.  And Denver Pest, you commie fuck.  Oh, boy, do you kiss Obama's ass.  The president's policies do have an effect on gas prices.  Don't make it sound like everyone likes to just shield Obama from everything.  Well, he doesn't do that.  He doesn't do this.  He's not in charge of the fucking State Department. 
[00:28:00]  He doesn't regulate security for embassies.  He doesn't do anything about the gas prices.  No, he fucking does.  His policies dictate these things.  You don't like when he kisses Obama's ass?  I don't like when anybody kisses Obama's ass.  Because you're a rah-rah guy for Romney.  No, I'm not.  I'll call him out.  Anthony, can I kiss your ass for a second?  Yes, that I like.  I just got a quick question also about...  Helicopters?  Oh, helicopters rule.  I want to fucking buy one, but then I really don't know how many they are.  It makes me sad.  Scrubbed again for wind yesterday.  I'm like NASA at this point. 
[00:28:30]  I was bummed.  I was following your tweets.  I'm like, all right, when's the flight?  I was bummed, too.  You fucking scrubbed it two days in a row.  First rain and now wind.  That wouldn't have raised the flag in Long Island.  A little helicopter flying up.  Considering what's happening.  You should have flown right over the debate.  With a sign.  Say hi, Mitt and Bob and Brock.  You were.  That would have went well.  You are within range.  I was pretty goddamn close.  That's why I was saying I was actually on location at the debate.  I figured I could do that with the show last night.  You know what?  That's another thing that they're going to have to be careful of with.  Those helicopters is political figures. 
[00:29:00]  Jesus.  The Secret Service can't fucking stop everything.  That's a scary thing.  Yeah.  Chris, what do you want to say?  I've got to move on.  Yeah, no problem, man.  Romney didn't reply when Obama said he was standing in front of a coal plant saying that  these plants kill.  Can anybody find a clip on that, if that actually happened or not?  Well, I mean, Romney was pretty silent at that point, so I would assume there was some  truth to it.  Or he would have defended himself. 
[00:29:30]  Anthony, tell me, bro.  No, no, no.  I have to address something else.  Just like the debate, I have to address something from previous.  I didn't say the president dictates oil prices.  You stupid fucks.  He dictates policies.  I said his policies have an effect on oil prices.  His foreign policy, his domestic drilling policies, his pipeline construction policies, they have  effects on gas prices. 
[00:30:00]  I didn't say the president goes in there with speculators and starts throwing numbers around.  I didn't say the president's part of OPEC, but what he does or doesn't do in this country  abso-fucking-lutely affects oil prices.  All right.  Let me move on.  Thanks, Chris.  Who's this?  Hey, how you doing?  This is...  You there?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We're here.  Oh, hey.  I'm sorry.  Hi.  This is Derek in Hoppock.  You've had me on before.  We've talked politics.  Oh, good.  I have to take issue with Anthony, though, because I think you have Obama paranoia, because 
[00:30:30]  if I recall, when Obama got...  Listen, listen.  When Obama got elected, I remember you said, I'm going out.  I'm buying all these guns.  I'm going to take our guns.  And then he can raise our taxes.  You know what?  He didn't do any of that shit.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, shithead.  My taxes are going up in January if Obama's elected.  My taxes are going sky high.  So fuck your mother. 
[00:31:00]  I did...  I said they're going to...  I...  What?  You get to keep your guns.  No, you get to keep your guns.  Oh, you did say Obama would take all your guns.  Hey, hey, I don't know what's going to happen in the second term.  He's not...  You know what?  He's not known as Mr. Second Amendment.  He hasn't done anything as of yet.  He acknowledged the Second Amendment last night.  Of course he did.  And I said...  He's a Second Amendment guy.  And I said last night that I wasn't completely fucking turned off by what Obama was saying about the Second Amendment. 
[00:31:30]  Nice.  I don't like the fact that a lot of people equate machine guns with what is deemed an assault weapon in this country.  And they confuse it.  And a lot of people don't know that an assault weapon is nothing more than a semi-automatic rifle in this country that has cool gadgets on it that doesn't affect the actual bullet leaving the fucking barrel.  But people think it's a machine gun.  And that confusion and the lack of clarity with Democrats and liberals as far as clearing that up with people is a lie, I believe. 
[00:32:00]  But I didn't completely dislike what Obama said about the Second Amendment last night.  Oh, can I...  Okay, but wait, wait.  One more point.  One more point.  Earlier you said that, hey, Bush was a wartime president, so that's why the deficit went off.  Well, guess what?  The war did not end when Obama took office.  So Obama is also a wartime president.  And so to quote yourself, you're saying, oh, well, you've got to pay for it. 
[00:32:30]  Excuse me.  Oh, boy.  What I'm saying is, with the wars winding down, with the wars winding down, the next four years, we are going to need more of an economic president.  Those are the times that will let us know what type of president we need.  Yes.  A dictator.  How much is our taxes going up if Obama's reelected?  We are fucked, Opie. 
[00:33:00]  We are fucked.  I'm taking notes, as an undecided voter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How much is going up?  It'll be well above 40%.  40%.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And right now we're paying in the 30s a federal.  That's a federal tax.  I wrote that down.  I'm collecting all my info as an undecided voter.  There are a fuckload of other taxes that will go on.  Is it really going up 40%?  Not up 40%.  It's going up to 40%.  Just the federal.  Jesus.  What are we now?  36?  36? 
[00:33:30]  Ah, 4%.  That's easy.  I can handle that.  Well, tack that on to the fact that you're not going to be able to deduct your fucking  mortgage interest.  That's always a nice thing.  Why can't you deduct your mortgage interest?  Well, we got to do away with that shit.  That's like paying a tax to the bank on the fucking money.  We got to do away with that.  Well, also, and let me tell you something.  With the bracket I'm in, Romney will also do that.  I'm pretty sure Romney is looking to do the same thing.  But Romney's looking to bring the general federal tax down for everybody. 
[00:34:00]  But then there's going to be these deductions that go away for the wealthy.  See?  Romney taking away things from the wealthy.  Oh, my God.  Yes, he is.  And how about the death tax that's coming into play after January 1st under Obama?  50%.  Yeah, with that one.  You die with over fucking a million dollars in assets, half of it goes to the government.  But that one doesn't bother me because you're dead.  Who gives a fuck? 
[00:34:30]  Capital gains taxes.  Your whole life turns off like a computer.  I don't give a fuck what happens after that.  What about the kids?  You got children.  They'll figure it out.  They're all right.  Yeah, they'll figure it out.  Capital gains taxes are going up so high that I don't think a lot of people are going to  find investing in companies to be a viable way to make some money.  Yeah, we're just fucking.  You know, as an income.  We're just fucking ourselves.  We just really are.  I'm so fucking disgusted. 
[00:35:00]  Which one do you want to go to?  Oh, I don't care.  Just pick one.  Sure.  The mediator was 100% for Obama.  We went over that point already.  Yes.  Let's go to.  All right.  This guy thinks Romney won hands down.  Ooh.  Mitt.  Let's say hi to Carlos in Houston.  Carlos.  Carlos.  Carlos.  Hey, I'm a conservative.  For a Latino, I'm super conservative.  Probably more conservative than Anthony.  I totally agree with Anthony.  There's only one area that I did not agree with Romney, and that is taxing, keeping the 
[00:35:30]  taxes of the wealthy.  We need to eliminate all taxes on the wealthy, because the wealthy create jobs.  Their tax is job creation.  Leave the damn wealthy alone, for God's sake.  I like the way he thinks.  Well, when I was listening to the debate last night, I heard a lot about taxing the rich  and the fact that Romney wants to cut taxes for the wealthy.  This is just not fucking true.  Obama wants to raise taxes. 
[00:36:00]  Across the board, by the way.  I don't know what he's talking about, this not raising taxes on the middle class, but  he is.  There are plenty of taxes going into play for the middle class.  But as far as the wealthy goes, Romney isn't looking to cut taxes for the wealthy.  Absolutely not.  And I'm not even looking for a tax break.  I'm not sitting here looking for a tax break.  Well, I am sitting here.  I am looking to not pay more fucking taxes.  Spend your money more wisely, government.  Yes, well, that would be nice. 
[00:36:30]  That's idiotic.  It'll never happen.  The wealthy should pay zero?  Hold on.  The wealthy should pay...  The wealthy create jobs.  Yes, true.  They don't pay a fucking tax.  No, you're right.  You're right.  No, no, you're right.  Good point.  They should...  Because they always give back to people.  That's what the wealthy always do.  They built the roads.  They built everything.  Right.  They were the ones out there.  All the wealthy people.  Yes.  Like the way this guy thinks. 
[00:37:00]  Shut up, you dummy.  The wealthy shouldn't pay taxes.  You're a dope.  He's right.  I like this guy, Jim.  He's a dope.  You're a dope, sir.  You're a Republican.  The next day you're a conservative.  The next day you're a liberal.  He had the nerve of me to change my mind according to what's happening in the world, you ideological boob.  Shut up.  The more money you have, the more you spend...  The more you spend...  The more you spend...  Shut up. 
[00:37:30]  Take your ideology and fucking hang yourself.  Romney wants immigration.  They need to close that fucking border down, for God's sake.  Yeah.  And the rich don't pay no taxes, because they hand out turkeys.  The rich keep me employed.  Shut your face.  And we placate too much to the middle class.  Yeah.  The middle class is the problem.  Let the wealthy not pay taxes.  You're all horses patoot.  Absolutely.  More jobs, brother. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Because that's what the wealthy do.  They never do anything shitty with the money.  They always give it back through trickle-down.  That's what they do with the money.  You're a maroon.  Shut up.  It doesn't matter.  They're going to make money by doing whatever they do with the money.  The reason the money goes out of the country, Jimmy, is because we overtax the rich, Jimmy.  Right.  That's the only reason, because we overtax.  Now, I don't disagree that the rich is overtaxed on certain things.  But you're saying the wealthy shouldn't pay taxes. 
[00:38:30]  And when you say that, it makes you...  Let me finish my sentence, sir.  But when you say the rich shouldn't pay taxes, it makes you sound like a fucking dope.  Of course it does.  You're just throwing air out there, Jimmy.  Yes, that's what words are, stupid.  We breathe out, and air comes out.  You sound stupid.  Read the freaking Federalist paper.  Read the Constitution.  Read freaking...  Yeah.  The wealthy shouldn't pay taxes.  Chairman Melville, why don't you fucking get educated before you put down... 
[00:39:00]  What part of the Constitution do you like?  All men are created equal?  Is that the part of the Constitution you like?  No, actually, the part of the Constitution that I like is the Ten Amendments.  I also love We the People.  It's a beautiful beginning.  Sure.  That's what it's about.  We have to protect the rich.  We're not supposed to alienate them.  We're not supposed to get into a class warfare.  Oh, they're doing good.  They're successful.  Let's punish them so that Joey over there... 
[00:39:30]  I've got to agree with that.  No, no, you're right.  When they said...  You're right.  Let's take one money from Peter to pay Paul and the hell with John.  Yeah.  Oh, I hate that.  No, you're right, sir.  I hate that saying.  Take it from Peter to pay Paul.  When they said, we the people...  No, you're right.  They were very wealthy guys who said, we the people.  And yet, they did none of their own work.  They had slave labor, you dunce.  But they really did. 
[00:40:00]  So, Jimmy's bringing up what I call the good old days.  Or are you going to judge them on their times?  For God's sake, they created the freaking...  Judge...  Hold on.  Judge them on our times, not their times.  So, a couple of hundred years...  So, wait.  How come you're judging them on their times, though?  Yeah, you got to...  Wait, wait.  No, no, no.  No, Carlos.  You can't play it both ways, Carlos.  You're playing it both ways.  You're saying what they said is wonderful.  And in their time, what they're saying was terrific.  And I'm saying, but they were full of shit in that way.  We, the people, did not apply to all the people.  They built this country. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, well, they're the ones that supported the freaking war, you know.  Oh, shut up.  They fucking built it on slave labor in the South.  They took a loan from China to pay for the revolution?  No, George Washington participated.  Thomas Jefferson.  All these rich people that you hate are the ones who paid for the revolution.  I don't hate the rich people.  All the rich people that you want to tax the devil...  Wrong, stupid.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  You sound like a middle-class guy who's a lapdog for his rich boss. 
[00:41:00]  You sound like a middle-class guy who is just trying to impress his rich boss.  Like a little lapdog.  I work for myself.  I don't have to impress anyone.  So do I.  I do what I'm supposed to do.  So do I.  And I pay more taxes than I'd like to.  But for you to sit there and say wealthy people shouldn't pay taxes, you sound like a dope.  Because you're an uneducated idiot that goes by what?  The liberal media.  Yeah.  We need to freaking... 
[00:41:30]  No, you're right.  I'm a slave to the liberal media.  Way to listen to the show, you dummy.  I do listen to the show.  One day you're a rhino.  The next day you're a conservative.  The next day you're...  Yeah, sorry.  I'm not a fucking idiot who's married to an ideology on principle.  My opinions change because...  The ideology works, Jimmy.  Yeah.  We the people.  50 years until 1912 when they decided to screw the people in this country by introducing income tax. 
[00:42:00]  And then they didn't leave it there.  They upped it every single year.  Yeah.  So what's that got...  What has that got to do with you saying the rich shouldn't be taxed?  The rich alone.  Oh, shut up.  The rich alone.  There should be more jobs.  Oh, you fucking lapdog.  The rich are suffering.  Then, Jimmy, what do you stand on?  Are you for the rich or not?  Just to say that, you sound...  You're complaining about the way I changed my...  Are you for the rich or not? 
[00:42:30]  Do you want to hurt the rich, Jimmy?  Is that what you want to do?  Is that what's going to make you...  I want to be the rich, you fucking blithering idiot.  But I want to protect you.  I don't want...  I don't want your protection.  I don't want to not pay taxes.  Make a billion dollars.  I don't want one penny taken from you because...  Well, good for you.  Good for you.  ...to create wealth for others.  That's absolutely stupid.  People that...  Create Adam Smith, for God's sake.  That's how you create wealth in a nation.  Good.  You tell yourself that. 
[00:43:00]  As a single business owner, as a small business owner, I make a good living.  And I don't mind paying...  You want to ask me where I stand on it?  I don't mind paying my taxes.  I don't want to be overtaxed into what I...  Well, then fucking do...  Then man up and do something about it.  Leave the fucking country.  I said, why do I have to leave the country?  Because I want to defend rich people from...  You're asking me where I stand on it.  And then you're babbling over my answer.  And besides that, the rich are leaving the country.  If Obama gets re-elected... 
[00:43:30]  Oh, shut up.  No, they're not.  And they will invest in other countries.  Let me ask you a question.  How are you going to compete?  How are you going to compete?  How do you compete with something like Apple, who is having all their work done in China?  I'm not saying I blame them, because what they're getting done there for $2 an hour would cost probably $17 or $18 an hour.  There's no way for us to compete with that.  Lower taxes on corporations.  Oh, no, no.  But lower taxes... 
[00:44:00]  Lowering taxes is not the issue.  You said rich people shouldn't pay taxes.  They shouldn't.  You're stupid.  You're just dumb.  You're dumb.  We the people.  Back when they wrote the Constitution...  Well, how come they had slaves back then if you were in a...  No, but you can't judge them according to those times.  But you're judging them.  But God's sakes, the whole world had slaves back then.  No, they didn't.  You're going to blame only America?  No, I'm just...  I live in America, so I'm can...  No, hold on.  I'm not blaming America. 
[00:44:30]  I'm only saying...  Oh, you're just babbling.  I'm not blaming America.  I mean, you talk, I'll listen.  Good.  Exactly.  And I'll listen to you when you talk.  I'm not blaming America.  Being an American, I judge what our country did because I'm concerned with what our country did.  I'm concerned with the double standards in America.  I'm not concerned with what China does.  I'm not concerned with other countries being full of shit.  But when my country has done things that are completely full of shit, that does concern me. 
[00:45:00]  When it's quoted by guys like you who will call up, like, the founding fathers, they did everything right.  And I'm saying that they were rich, but a lot of what they did was not fair.  So don't sit there and act like they were these fucking terrific guys.  What's that?  Answer that question.  Where was it not fair?  They wrote the Constitution for themselves and nobody else.  No shit.  That's exactly how it's supposed to be, Jimmy.  You don't want a poor person that has no education voting, do you, Jimmy? 
[00:45:30]  This guy is actually kidding.  No, I'm not kidding.  You are.  I'm dead serious.  Dude.  Do you want poor people that have no education voting, Jimmy?  Is that what you want?  I actually don't believe this guy anymore.  I actually, I honestly, I'm calling Bravo Sierra.  Oh, come on, dude.  He's talking, he is talking, he is talking about they put the safety in place that, that uneducated poor people, as he's saying, do not have as much power in a vote because we don't live in a democracy. 
[00:46:00]  We live in a constitutional republic.  We have a republic.  It's supposed to protect those that produce.  That is the key.  People that produce, this country is supposed to protect.  Not people that want to steal from those that produce.  Not people that want handouts from government.  How about people?  Hold on.  How about people?  And these are the people that wrote it.  How about people that are using forced labor from other people, which by proxy is stealing? 
[00:46:30]  Where are we using forced labor, Jimmy?  Where in this country are we using forced labor?  No, no, no.  I'm talking about when the Constitution was written and slave labor was used.  My point is you're acting like these guys are these amazing moral crusaders.  And what irritates me is they were using slave labor.  And you're saying that poor people who are uneducated shouldn't get the vote.  But they weren't allowed to be educated.  Nobody's perfect.  78 years.  See, that's why I don't believe this guy.  I don't believe you're this big of a dummy.  Can I finish my thought?  You asked me a question. 
[00:47:00]  Can I finish my thought?  Yes, you can.  Stupid.  Okay, thank you.  78 years after the creation of the Constitution, slavery was ended, Jimmy.  78 years after the creation of this country.  And not only that, the Founding Fathers left a safety in the Constitution where blacks were considered,  slave blacks were considered, three-fifths.  The reason that's a safety, and a lot of liberals don't seem to understand this point,  is because the Southern states that did have slaves would have made those slaves vote. 
[00:47:30]  Yes, I understand that.  And four congressmen would have gone towards Washington keeping slavery.  What the Founding Fathers did was put a safety valve there, and eventually slavery was going to be overturned.  But they could not tackle that issue at the time because they just got done with the revolution.  You had Southern states talking about leaving the Northern states, and they just wanted to create the country with a republic. 
[00:48:00]  It all worked out.  But you do not keep bringing white guilt.  I'm not guilty.  You got the wrong guy for white guilt.  You're talking to the wrong person for white guilt.  You really are misinterpreting.  If I misquoted you, I apologize.  No, you're just misreading the entire thing.  Yeah, Jimmy's made that point very clear.  I've made that point a thousand times how white guilt is revolting.  Would you sit there?  Hold on.  I just listened to you, and you're just going to trample over me? 
[00:48:30]  I just listened to you talk for three minutes, and now I'm responding.  Yeah, sure.  And then after slavery was ended, what was said in this country that was supposed to be done wasn't done.  It just wasn't done.  And I'm not harping on that.  Explain that point.  What do you mean?  Um, equal protection was not given under the law.  Equal opportunity was not given under the law.  And you know that.  You know that.  There's not supposed to be equal opportunity for equal results. 
[00:49:00]  It's supposed to be you are free.  You make your life the way you are.  That's not the way it was.  What do you mean?  Why were, why, okay, I'll tell you what I mean.  Hold on.  I'll tell you.  Why were certain people in this country not allowed to vote until this, until the 19th century, or the 20th century?  Uh, which people?  Give me, and I'll answer.  I'll answer.  Black people.  Blacks and women.  Okay.  Blacks were uneducated.  They were free as slaves. 
[00:49:30]  So you're going to allow uneducated people now to vote?  Is that what you want to do?  So you're saying that uneducated people, hold on, women, with the exception of Ann Coulter, I have not known a woman to be able to cast a rational, logical vote.  Finally, I just, finally, I totally agree with you.  Yeah, I just, I can't even, dude, we're just, what can I say?  There's no way to debate this. 
[00:50:00]  If you can actually, you're one of those guys who, you're in a different place.  You're just in a different place.  Am I?  Yes.  Am I?  We're just going to have to agree to disagree.  Yeah, I'm actually.  I think we've got one of those situations.  Okay, I'll go along with that.  All right, Carlos.  Of course it is.  Carlos, thank you for your phone calls.  Thank you, Carlos.  Holy shit, I'm exhausted.  I mean, yeah, what are you going to say?  I have women, he understands why women in black sport are allowed to vote. 
[00:50:30]  Yes.  He's a Spanish guy, right?  So he said.  Yeah, yeah.  Carlos.  What a fucking lampa dancing.  Oh, it's a good place to take a break.  Wow.  Well, we'll talk more debate after the break.  Sure, why not?  Maybe do some Jocktober.  Talk about the Yankees.  I saw some Jocktober.  I actually.  I saw the tweet.  Did you see the tweet?  Oh, God.  Dish Nation.  Dish Nation.  It stinks.  Dish Nation.  Got to watch it.  It was Blaine and fucking, what's her name?  Blaine and Allison.  Blaine and Allison were actually on there.  To watch them and see and hear. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  I was stunned.  Were they good?  It's horrible.  It was so.  He's like, have that, Aisha!  With a bad voice.  She's like, oh.  It was so bad.  If you watch the show like on a daily basis, which everybody should.  Oh, yes.  Like half the time, she's shoveling donuts and stuff in her mouth.  It's really funny.  That's classic.  All right.  We'll get into other things.  Stay there.  Sirius XM. 
[00:51:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  How's your banana, Sam?  Sam has his banana.  He peels it all nice and everything.  And he's getting ready to eat it.  Jim karate chopped it.  It went flying.  I'm off my banana.  I'm cleaning it out of my keyboard.  Are you really? 
[00:52:00]  That was so goddamn funny.  I love how Jimmy does things and then just starts laughing his ass off about it.  And then just walks away.  When he took his shoe off and placed it on Bob Kelly's sandwich.  He just took his nasty shoe and just put the fucking tread of the shoe right on top of Bob's sandwich.  He doesn't respect food.  Not at all.  He doesn't want anyone else eating.  No.  Did you get a chance to watch your Yankees?  Through all the debate shit?  Actually, I was keeping tabs on it as best I could. 
[00:52:30]  But the debate, very important.  So, no, I knew what was going on.  This is just bad.  It's just a bad fucking year for them to have even made it this far.  Very difficult.  Everyone was saying they were peaking at the right time.  They had the momentum.  And then everything just fell to fucking part.  They're in.  All the sportscasters are calling this an unbelievable slump that they're in at an absolute horrible time.  And it just shows you what kind of a guy Derek Jeter is as their captain. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  No one's stepping up.  No one's rallying.  It does seem like when they're playing now that there's no real royalty on the team.  Oh, God, no.  No leadership.  It's just, you know, it's Joe Girardi putting the guys out there and hoping for the best.  It just...  They sat A-Rod yesterday?  Yeah, yeah.  Did he get in at all?  A-Rod and Swisher...  And the Swish.  They're in such bad shape.  It's just...  They're not doing anything.  So he tried just sitting them and, you know, apparently it didn't work. 
[00:53:30]  And Detroit 1-2-1.  Yep.  2-1.  I would imagine the numbers were down on that game, no?  With the debate.  I would assume, yeah.  So, they got another game tonight in Detroit, and that'll be it for the Yankees if they lose  this one.  Isn't it 2-3-2?  2-3-2 format?  2-3-2.  So they got two more in Detroit.  Two more in Detroit.  Jesus, you're so done for this year.  But this could absolutely...  How the fuck are they going to come back from a 3-0 deficit? 
[00:54:00]  They're all busted up.  Travis, you gotta be pissed, man.  That the Yankees are just fucking sucking.  Yeah, you know, there were other teams that would have gladly played in the ALC.  Yeah, they don't even look like they want to play.  Sorry you couldn't beat them.  Yeah, you know what?  That's what it came down to.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, they faced a tough pitcher last night, but...  What about the first?  It was 2-1.  There's been 30 innings, and they haven't led once.  That's crazy.  Oh, is that what's going on?  Yeah, they haven't led once. 
[00:54:30]  I think your Orioles would have given them a better fight.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Like Ant said, they just look flat.  Yeah, they don't look like they want to be there.  No, now it just looks like, let's get this over with.  And it's to the point where they should be benching everyone, but they can't bench everyone.  Yeah.  They can only bench a couple people at a time.  It's just they're in a slump at the wrong fucking time.  They've had that cheater injury.  He's huge.  Girardi's father dying is huge.  Girardi's father died.  That gets in everyone's heads.  I don't know.  I don't think that suddenly means people can't see that. 
[00:55:00]  Except for A-Rod, because he's too busy fucking flirting.  Flirting.  What a dick.  Yeah.  He's just a dick.  They look like that.  Who's that?  Who do you think?  Yeah, A-Rod.  Where did we just say it?  Oh, with that fucking girl.  He's a complete scumbag.  Yeah.  They're paying him a lot of money.  Five more years.  He's giving his number to girls in the fucking front row.  We're getting their number while he's destroying his team in the playoffs.  Yeah.  A piece of garbage.  And not stepping up whatsoever.  I hate the fact that he has to pay taxes, though.  That really bothers me. 
[00:55:30]  You have five more years on the contract, but you know what?  Donald Trump's got a good idea.  Oh, yeah?  I got a clip of Donald Trump making a lot of sense today, believe it or not.  That Donald is crazy, isn't he?  I think he's a liability to the Yankees.  I mean, they're paying him $30 million a year, and he strikes out every time he comes up in  a playoff game.  As a businessman, what do you do with that?  I mean, I would terminate his contract, personally.  I think George would have done that.  I would terminate his contract on the basis that when he signed, he didn't say that he 
[00:56:00]  took drugs.  He actually admitted that he took drugs.  So, now he's not taking drugs anymore, and without drugs, he's less than an average player.  Nice.  There you go.  There you go.  What kind of logic is that?  That's hilarious.  That's some good logic.  That's some Trump logic.  He might be right, though.  But they won't do that because they want the home run record in New York.  That's why they have it.  When did A-Rod start sucking?  It's so funny that he said that he should be terminated for not taking drugs. 
[00:56:30]  Pretty much.  A year, year or two ago.  I mean, he doesn't suck.  He's just on the decline.  He's a choke.  He's on the tail end of his...  He's always been a choke.  He's always been a choke, though.  When he was with the Mariners, when he was with the Rangers, he's always been a playoff  choke.  He's just that guy.  He's a choke.  You don't think he should be fired?  You're fired.  You're fired.  I would tell him, you're fired.  I'm glad the businessman thinks it's so easy that you can just say...  Terminate his contract. 
[00:57:00]  You know what kind of precedent that would set?  Jesus Christ.  How great would that be?  You're a nut.  Make A-Rod sue for the money.  Hey, look, if he's a guy who was taking steroids and that jacked him up, or whatever it was  he was taking, and that jacked up his stats and he didn't say that in his contract, maybe  technically Trump is right.  Yeah, that's not a crazy thought.  Yeah, I don't think you can do that.  Huh?  I don't think you can do that.  Man.  I don't know.  He's saying he breached this contract by putting a false sense that he was good? 
[00:57:30]  Or no.  Like, let's say you lie about plagiarism or something.  Yeah.  Let's say you get a job based on something you wrote and people find out that a lot of  what you wrote was plagiarized.  So he got the job because he was good, but he was good because of the drugs.  And he probably said something about not taking drugs in the contract.  I obviously don't know that, but if he did, he should be fine.  I don't know.  That's odd.  Oh, well, the jingle contest.  Do we have any entries?  I haven't burned them for you onto a disc. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, don't burn them.  That sounds very dangerous.  Yeah, why would you want to do that?  You'll damage the equipment and hurt your hands.  We need to play a few of those today.  Would you like to hear some?  Oh, yeah.  If we're talking about the contest, we need to see what's coming in already.  Yeah, we're getting a lot of entries.  Oh, good.  Nice.  Yeah, give me a few.  Listeners love this contest.  The new jingle contest.  We'll have all the details when we have some to play.  Greg.  Which is a little later.  A little later on.  I'll take some good ones, and maybe I'll give you some of the nonsense.  Eh?  Oh, wow. 
[00:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  That debate was late for me.  Hey.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I stayed up for another fucking few hours.  Yeah, but that's your thing.  I don't know why I do, though.  You could do that.  I stay up for no reason.  I stay up for no reason.  Were you tired?  Yeah.  But then I just don't go to sleep.  You don't want to miss anything.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  You're a little child who doesn't want to miss the big thing. 
[00:59:00]  Yes.  And then I wind up going to bed and go, why did I stay up?  And I wake up and I'm all sleepy.  What did you do after the debate?  Well, I had to do a few things with the Ustream channel, my Ustream channel, shuffle around  some videos and stuff like that.  But then for the most part, I'm just walking around the house, fucking watching TV, getting  up, eating some grapes.  As soon as I'm tired, I fucking go to my room and fucking crash.  No, just watch TV.  Nah.  I'm on the Twitter.  You know, I should just go to sleep. 
[00:59:30]  What the fuck is wrong with me?  What's worse than dirty texting right before bed?  Because then you're trying to fall asleep.  You're like, I want to get back to her.  And you just check to see if she's just not.  Dirty texting, Jimmy.  Well, you just sit there in bed just waiting for...  Does that noise get you going?  Because you know there's a dirty text coming in?  Yeah.  Photo.  Vagina.  Maybe a photo?  I have it off my phone.  I don't see...  I have to look to actually see them.  That's just like being woken up by a mosquito. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  No, my kid sounds like a mosquito.  Does he?  She.  Oh, the she one.  She wakes up and sounds like a mosquito.  My son sounded like a wild animal.  This one sounds like a mosquito when she wakes up in the middle of the night.  Got a virtual jungle in there.  Yeah, yeah.  Crazy.  No, the first kid was horrifying because you don't realize that a kid can make those type of noises.  Oh, really?  You think it's all goo-goo-ga-ga and then all of a sudden...  Oh, my God.  It's like wild animals.  It's crazy.  That's how I remember it with him. 
[01:00:30]  But this one, it's a mosquito that wakes up.  Kid sounds like a mosquito like that.  I could probably record that.  You should.  I'm a very private guy, but maybe I could record that for everybody.  Well, I don't think any secrets will be out.  All right.  I'll record her sounding like a mosquito.  Fair enough.  Sounds much more gentle.  That should get the ratings up, man.  Yeah.  That'll get more subscribers.  What?  Sounds much more gentle.  Yeah, I guess.  Delicate.  Delicate, sure. 
[01:01:00]  Sure.  Are we having Rory Kennedy come in today?  Yes.  I didn't get to see the documentary.  It was very good.  Was it good?  Ethel.  Yeah, Ethel.  It's amazing.  It's about Ethel Kennedy.  It's called Ethel.  It's an HBO documentary.  She's fucking amazingly coherent.  She's in her 80s.  80s nothing anymore.  But I mean, she's...  Chuck Yeager was 89 and what?  He was breaking the sound barrier a couple days ago.  Is he still alive?  Yeah.  He just broke the sound barrier.  Again, at 89, right, Ant?  Yeah, he was a passenger, but, you know. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, but that's good enough.  That's still pretty fucking good.  They probably allowed him to push the buttons.  Push the buttons up there.  And then, you know, they weren't sure if an 89-year-old could handle that shit.  That's my point.  Chuck Yeager was badass.  Wow.  But he's fucking nine.  Yeah, he broke the sound barrier again as a passenger.  You know, I'm sure he worked a few instruments.  But anyway, she's coherent, you're saying?  Extremely.  Yeah, she was really insightful about...  It's like an hour and 40 minutes ago, a real movie about Robert Kennedy.  There's a lot of home footage.  It's a real movie, Jack. 
[01:02:00]  It's a real movie.  It's a real movie, Jack.  It's a real movie, Jack.  All right.  I thought it was really, really good.  It was all interviews with Ethel Kennedy and the kids.  Yeah.  It was very sad at parts.  It's weird because they call her Mummy.  That's such a...  Mummy.  ...a wealthy thing to do.  Mummy.  Mummy.  That's real wealth.  That's real wealth.  That's that yuck wealth.  Kennedy money.  Crazy Kennedy money.  But she was married to him for 23 years.  I didn't realize they were...  When you think about them, they almost like just they appeared on the earth and became 
[01:02:30]  these famous politicians and a president, and both guys were shot.  But he's like, oh, yeah, they were married.  They had kids for years and years and years.  They took a real life together.  All right.  We'll talk to Rory Kennedy at 915.  She never met her father, by the way.  She was born six months after he died.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  He was...  She was...  Ethel was three months pregnant when he got shot with this girl.  Damn.  Can we go backwards?  I wanted to ask one question, though.  Is Taylor Swift going out with a Kennedy?  Oh, you didn't know that. 
[01:03:00]  Taylor Swift is dating Rory's nephew, Connor.  Connor Kennedy?  Yeah.  Connor Kennedy and Taylor Swift are an item.  Oh, Jesus.  Let me see.  Difficult.  But she's that golly gee girl.  Let's not forget.  Yeah.  She's just a regular gal.  She is.  And she proves it every day that she's just a regular gal.  I am.  Yeah.  Anyone could go out with a Kennedy.  Yeah.  Can I...  I got to go backwards.  Yes.  I can't fake it anymore.  I thought Chuck Yeager was flying in the fucking plane.  Did you think he was flying in the plane? 
[01:03:30]  I got to be honest.  I assumed that when he...  Chuck flew...  Because I saw the headline.  I'm like, wow, that's kind of cool.  89.  Yeah.  And he redid the sound barrier thing.  And then when you said he was a passenger, I'm like, yeah, I know that.  But I didn't know that.  I got to be honest.  I really thought he was flying.  I really thought he was the guy again.  It wouldn't have been out of the realm of possibility.  He was flying up until relatively recently as far...  And still, you know, breaking the sound barrier.  Why is that a huge headline if he was just a passenger?  And then I made believe he did the instrument thing. 
[01:04:00]  Well, it was the anniversary of him breaking the sound barrier.  He's 89.  He's fucking going faster than the speed of sound at 89 in a plane.  That's kind of big.  Yeah.  That's kind of big.  I really thought he was...  He was like, wow, that's pretty impressive.  Flying that thing.  89 and he's still doing it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  He set a lot of records even into his 70s and 80s.  Right.  I mean, he still did very well. 
[01:04:30]  This Apple's getting exhausting.  They're going to unveil the iPad Mini on October 23rd.  Who wants a mini iPad?  They just keep moving this shit around.  Yeah, but that's what you guys said about the iPad.  I'll tell you who wants an iPad Mini.  I don't want one.  Um, I'm going to get the iPad Mini because it's an Apple Mini.  I'm going to get it.  The problem is, like, they make this one a little bigger, this one a little smaller.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  That's all they're doing.  How about you just settle with one size and be done with it? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Do you have the new iPhone?  So is it?  I don't have it yet, no.  So the Apple Mini is now going to be closer to the Apple 5.  Yeah.  But then they're going to make the Apple 5 a little bigger.  The next Apple phone will probably make it a little bigger.  A little bigger?  Stop with this nonsense.  I don't know.  I fucking...  As far as Apple goes now, I can't think of anyone else but that fucking woman that Sam  interviewed.  I can't think...  That, to me, now is the face of Apple.  It's terrible. 
[01:05:30]  Imagine the stock just plummished because of Rachel.  Imagine it has.  It's in the shitter as far as where it was.  She's 40.  Are you fucking with the Apple stock these days?  I fucked with it the wrong way and now I'm sitting on pieces of shit.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  Oh, you didn't bring that to the show.  No, because I'm like Obama.  You only bring your victories.  I'm like Obama.  No, I've talked about it.  I've mentioned on the air how I was in call options and it just took a shit.  People like to hear about your defeats as well, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  You're in a bad spot right now with Apple? 
[01:06:00]  I'm in a bad spot.  Yeah, I had bought 700 calls back when Apple was in the 680s.  Right.  And it just kept tumbling.  And it's 640 right now?  Yeah, it's shit.  When do you have to pay?  I don't have to pay, but when I don't get my money back that I put in is October 20th.  Oh, boy.  That's it.  So it's got to go...  It's not coming back.  No.  So it's got to get up to 680 before the 20th or you lose a few, huh?  I lose about 20 Gs. 
[01:06:30]  Holy...  Three days.  Yep.  Everyone go out there and pre-order those minutes.  It's done.  It's done.  At least you don't have to pay taxes.  Yeah, I can offset my gains with my losses.  Yeah.  Yeah, Apple.  I have no desire for an iPad mini.  The iPad I watch a lot of HBO Go on and it's a good size, but how much smaller can people  watch a screen?  I can't watch a tiny screen.  Boo-hoo.  You have more in the bank.  That's right.  Go fuck yourself. 
[01:07:00]  He said that.  People just don't listen closely.  Who wrote that boo-hoo.  Some asshole.  Boo-hoo.  But they don't listen closely.  No, they don't.  You're not fucking whining about it.  I'm not whining about it.  It's just what it is.  You were keeping your mouth shut.  I brought it to everyone's attention.  It's what it is.  Boo-hoo.  There was no boo-hoo in Anthony.  As funny as that is.  Boo-hoo.  There's no boo-hoo in Anthony's voice.  Did that annoy you when you read it?  Oh, did it annoy the shit out of me? 
[01:07:30]  Boo-hoo.  You have more.  You got more in the bank.  Shut it.  How small is the mini going to be?  One by one inch.  Compared to the iPad.  This is the size of a little fucking, what are those little iPods called?  Those little teeny ones?  The nano.  Yes, a little nano iPad.  I think about seven or eight inches across.  What is this one?  Probably like 10 or 12.  I never updated my iPad, by the way.  I got the original.  You guys still have the original, too.  You don't really need anything more than that. 
[01:08:00]  I swear to God, I don't know what I'm missing.  Although you don't have your retina display.  You're missing your retina display.  I don't get to look like one of those assholes holding up their giant phone.  To take a picture.  Oh, God, I hate those people.  Oh, good.  They're all over Comic-Con.  I understand.  Photos and video with iPads.  People are using it, but.  Is it the same as an iPhone video?  No, it's not as good.  Oh, not as good.  So what is it going to be?  Half the size of the original iPad?  What are we talking?  Probably a little larger than half the size.  So that would be a cool size, if you think about it. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, it's intended for easy travel.  If it's like this, that would be perfect.  How hard is this to travel with?  It's a fucking sheet of loose leaf paper.  It's a fucking notebook.  Yeah, we got a lot of iPads in my family.  Oh, my God.  We just throw it in luggage all the time.  You don't even notice it's in there.  Oh, they're great.  You just shove it right there.  A little smaller makes sense.  Yeah.  It does make sense.  I'll never get a smaller one.  I like the sizes now, and it's fun to, again, play chess with friends and shit.  I don't do as much on it as I thought I would, because you can't write on it. 
[01:09:00]  That, for me, is critical.  It's pretty good to just pick up if you want to do something on the Internet that's a little  bigger than your phone, you know?  So it's sitting around the house.  You can pick it up, and it's not like turning on a computer where you've got to wait, you  know, booting up.  Well, why is it we can't figure out one size for everything?  All these companies, like the Samsung, they've got the Note, which I've played with, and you  could put it in your back pocket, but it does feel a little too big, so then you have to  have two different things when you're traveling. 
[01:09:30]  Why can't we just have one?  I don't know.  It's different sizes for different things.  I do like the fact that the phone is there, but then when you're doing Internet-intensive  stuff, it does get a little small.  The iPad is great on the shitter.  Oh, my God.  Is it great on the shitter?  You're just sitting there.  Whoa.  You've got to run away.  But eventually, we will figure out one thing, and how is that?  You think?  We're going to have to, yeah.  I don't know, because for it to be portable, it's got to be small.  Maybe you could just stretch out the screen or something.  Maybe there's something...  Like the magic fucking chalkboard. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We're in Tennessee.  We're going to have the magic chalkboard eventually.  That one will come true.  You think?  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  Yeah.  All right, so the mini comes out on the 23rd.  All right.  The Yankees lost.  The mini and new computers, too.  Hockey might be coming back.  November 1st, they're talking or something like that?  Well, the NHL sent a new proposal to the players, and they're looking at doing a full season  and everything starting November 2nd. 
[01:10:30]  I don't know if the players have reacted yet, though, right?  I think that's where we're at.  Oh, fuck yourself.  I think it's a 50-50 split.  That seems a little fair.  Yeah.  Or fair.  Who's usually the scumbag in these things?  Owners.  Owners.  Owners always.  Owners always.  Yeah.  Owners always.  They're taking the risk.  Yeah, but after a while, professional sports.  You know, they've got to keep the fucking...  A few teams fold, I guess.  Yeah, they've got to keep the team real.  Not even folding, but some of them are better money-making ventures than others, you know? 
[01:11:00]  Right.  Well, you've got to be a good businessman.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's just it.  I would imagine most of these guys make a shitload of profits.  Yeah.  I just...  I just...  You know, there are a lot of scumbag businessmen and people that run businesses, but the fact  of the matter is, a lot of people don't look at it that these businessmen, they're the  ones taking the risks.  They're the ones taking the chances.  Yeah, but the players are the ones that fucking put their necks on the line.  Yeah, I don't just mean the...  Well, you know what?  Yeah.  That's their job. 
[01:11:30]  They're entertainers.  They're entertaining people.  That's pretty much what fucking sports is.  And, I don't know.  It just seems to me like business really has gotten a bad rap, which is amazing to me,  because without it, this country's fucked.  Well, I think...  But I think a lot of these guys, these businessmen, they're the ones taking the risks, and any  time they get reward, they're looked at as evil people.  Businesses have gotten a bad rap because...  It's not because they succeed, because they do... 
[01:12:00]  They make the country great.  But it's because they've become so greedy, and not greedy to a point where you've got  to make a profit, and we all want to make money.  But I think that's the stereotype, and I know there are realities based in stereotypes, but...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I've got to stop you.  Yeah?  It's not...  Look what happens around here.  These guys above us make so much fucking more money than us, and they don't fucking pass  it on to their employees.  Yeah, that's...  I know this world.  Yeah, with these CEOs taking giant bonuses, and then you walk around these hallways, and you 
[01:12:30]  see these guys that haven't had raises in a long fucking time, and when they do give  them raises, it's a tiny little bump up.  Fuck yeah.  I don't mind that they're taking giant bonuses, but they don't fucking put anything back into  their employees.  They don't voluntarily...  And this is most people don't voluntarily normally do the right thing until they're  forced to do it, and that's why they've gotten a bad...  Like Bank of America.  I took most of my money out and invested it because the amount of interest they pay is 
[01:13:00]  so disgustingly low.  Yeah.  Like, they all wanted bailout money.  They all want...  All banks wanted some kind of help, but they never give back.  That's where they're fucking hateable.  But that's like the Fed, though.  That doesn't really have anything to do with the bank itself.  They're not setting their own interest rates, you know?  It's weird.  It's...  Well...  And they take the brunt of the...  It's two different issues, obviously.  They take the brunt of the anger for it, but it really doesn't have anything to do  with the banks themselves.  Yeah, it's two different issues.  It's disgusting, the amount of interest you get with your bank account.  It's horrible. 
[01:13:30]  I'm lucky enough to have a few bucks in some accounts, and I look at my statements going,  really?  Holy fuck.  There was a time you used to be able to live off your interest.  Well, that shit's...  Long gone.  I get it.  Long gone.  But now, the average middle-class person...  Why would you even put money in a bank at all?  Yeah.  There's got to be another option.  Look at gas prices.  Like, when you see gas prices, that's what big business...  That's why people hate them.  Not because the oil companies make a good amount of money, and they're fucking smart guys,  but it's because there's such a fucking piggishness to it. 
[01:14:00]  Like, they just have to fuck you as hard as they possibly can, and for as long as they  possibly can.  And their excuse is not, wow, we're fucking...  We're pigs.  It's, hey, it's business.  Hey, it's business.  That's their...  That's where people have a problem with.  And not because they're fucking successful, or they make lots of money.  Because I don't...  I want to make lots of money.  I love making money.  Sure.  Well, that's a valid point.  But it gets to a point where that's what, at least myself, that's where I start to hate 
[01:14:30]  them.  Something seems to be completely out of control.  And these guys right here...  Between the worker and the boss.  Getting no raises.  You're right.  I just could talk about what I see around here, man.  You know?  And although we just signed, and they did right by us, you know, I still think there  was more to be given.  Whatever.  You know?  Well, that battle's always going to be there.  The workers always...  Yeah.  They deserve more, and the employee's going to say no.  I agree.  I mean, I'm satisfied with the new deal we got.  But I'm talking about these guys. 
[01:15:00]  There's...  You know, we're one of the lucky ones.  There's hundreds of people that work for this company that haven't seen shit.  Seen dick?  Nope.  And then you...  And it makes all the articles, the bonuses these guys are making.  Holy fuck.  Hmm.  And I think that's happening all over the place with a shitload of companies.  And then a lot of times when they don't do the right thing, and they leave the company,  they still get giant, giant fucking packages.  And that's where it turns people off.  It's like, it's not like, wow, you are horrible.  You gotta go.  They still get these giant fucking... 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  ...fucking take-home millions of dollars.  And it's like, that's where people get frustrated.  Right.  Right.  If I...  I wouldn't be mad reading about the bonuses these guys are getting if I knew that a lot  of these people that are working their balls off here at SiriusXM were getting their raises.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Like, I have zero issues with Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Zuckerberg.  None.  Steve Jobs.  But I'm saying, like, you know, I have no qualms with those guys making their money  because I think they were innovative and they fucking changed the country in a weird 
[01:16:00]  way.  Like, go ahead, get what you get.  I think Gates was smart.  He told, I think, Seattle or whatever, if they didn't change certain tax codes, he was  going to pull his money out of the country.  And they did.  Or it might have been the...  Right.  When you're able to do that...  He did something like that and they buckled.  But they just don't pass it down to the workforce as much as they used to.  That's my issue.  I don't care if they make a shitload of money.  Because they don't just create jobs.  That's the...  Like, what I was saying, trying to say before about Apple is, again, they take so many of 
[01:16:30]  these jobs to China, which, again, maybe I would do that, too, if I was a business and  I could get labor for two bucks instead of 18.  You know, I'm not a dummy.  Right.  But don't say that you're just going to pass it down and create jobs when American workers,  even though unions are crazy and way out of whack, they're never going to be able  to compete with a billion Chinese and the money that they can work for or Indians.  We will never, ever again be able to...  Our workers can never compete with that.  Have you ever played a venue based on unions being there or not being there, based on how 
[01:17:00]  much money they're going to be taking?  Yes and no.  It's harder to do...  Have you ever?  Well, I'm trying to think if I have.  Okay.  Um, I'm trying to think if we, because most of my stuff is done through, uh, Live Nation.  I don't know if we've ever...  Like, if I'm doing a Live Nation venue, I don't know if we consider if they're union  or not.  I mean, they might all be union, I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  But, um, I don't know the answer to that.  I probably...  I'm just saying if you've ever made a conscious decision... 
[01:17:30]  Would I?  ...to not do it.  Absolutely.  Absolutely I would.  Yes.  Because you would be able to pocket more of the money and not have to give it to these  union fucking guys.  Okay.  That's what I'm saying.  That's kind of what taking jobs overseas is...  That's not kind of...  It's exactly what taking jobs overseas is all about.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I do understand that.  Like, but an American worker will never be able to compete with that.  So, uh, yeah, because the unions are...  Like I said, in Cleveland, my experience with the unions in Cleveland, you were so fucking...  I think it was Teamsters, so awful and so fucking unreasonable. 
[01:18:00]  Yep, can't do my guy!  And I'm like, that's why...  They always go, yep, before him.  Yep, yep, yep, union man!  Yep!  But that's why I've turned so much against them.  Yeah, yeah.  It was not, hey, I want to give me all this fucking free work.  It was this absolutely unreasonable...  Yeah.  Being a twat fucking...  You're really extorted. 
[01:18:30]  Now, you bring that up a lot.  I would love to hear from some union guys why they're like that.  Yeah.  Where they don't budge an inch.  Yeah.  I would love to know why.  Especially bringing a show to Cleveland where a lot of shows are not shot, putting money...  Like, you know what I mean?  Logically, why is it that way?  Well, they'll go back...  They'll always go back years and years and years and talk about how management would fuck labor and stuff.  It's like, well, yeah, and then the unions came about and did good for the workers, and it worked.  But then the pendulum swung the other way, boo. 
[01:19:00]  And things are now in the...  They're the other way around.  And it's fucking...  It's really fucking with the country.  Look at the auto industry.  Look at Detroit.  Detroit's a fucking disaster.  It's because so many jobs wound up going overseas because the auto workers' union just fucking priced themselves out.  Obama saved the auto industry, though.  Yeah, that's great.  Hey, a large corps need to give more money to the middle class.  That's how the economy will shift.  I don't necessarily disagree with that there, Rick. 
[01:19:30]  Give money?  Give money?  Now, what does he mean by give money?  Well, give...  Now, give...  That's such a...  I just assume when he said give...  Well, we'll put him on the line.  All right.  I assume give money, meaning, you know, pay them, you know, fairly.  Let's see.  Rick, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, man, listen.  Here's the bottom line.  Here's the bottom line.  I want some onions and some beef.  I've watched that another at least ten times as we talked about it.  Stone Cold E.T. for the people that haven't checked it out yet. 
[01:20:00]  Go ahead, Rick.  Listen, I work for a $20 billion company.  Actually, what's in the coffer at the end of the year?  There's a lot of money.  It goes to what I call the black faces, and that's a stockholder.  People we don't know.  It doesn't get down to our workers.  It doesn't get down to the guy in the factory.  And there's only one way that you're ever going to get it done, and that's to raise minimum wage to $15 or $16 an hour.  Get it into the pockets of the middle class.  They will spend it as fast as they make it.  Trust me.  And that's what the problem is. 
[01:20:30]  I agree with you, by the way.  I make a lot of money, okay?  And Obama wants more of my money.  You know, I think the best thing he said in that debate last night is that 5% of the people, the top earners in this country, contribute 60% of the taxes in this country.  People don't understand that.  And the bottom line is we've got to get it in their pocket.  Because to take it from me and to take it from Anthony, because I know how rich he is, to take it from me.  Oh, man.  Crazy.  You know what?  This guy makes a good point, because the less money I had, the more I spent. 
[01:21:00]  Okay.  I spent every dollar that I had coming in, man.  Oh, and I enjoyed it, too.  And why don't we all funnel it right down through the government, because is it ever going to get to the middle class?  Hell no.  Giving them a fucking $3,200 a year tax break, they don't even see it.  They don't understand it.  They don't get it.  It's a ridiculous situation, and there's only one way.  We have got to raise the minimum wage and put it straight into their pockets.  And let the government subsidize that. 
[01:21:30]  Fuck somebody sitting around on their ass at home, and we're paying them.  Tell them to get a job, and we'll fucking pay them half the amount.  It's ridiculous what this country is doing right now and the way we're throwing our fucking money away.  We have the ability to generate trillions of dollars very, very quickly.  I'm telling you what Mitt's going to do.  He's going to come in, and he's going to slash all these fucking programs.  And we put our goddamn money in, it's ridiculous what is happening.  Slash these programs.  Put it back into the average worker's pocket.  All right, Rick.  I like the way you think. 
[01:22:00]  All right, Rick.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  We lost the union guy because that guy was going on and on.  Damn.  Damn it.  He wanted to defend unions.  Aw.  Maybe that guy could call back.  Let me say hi to Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  All right.  I'm against unions, but I can't consider it a fair comparison as the Jimmy not playing  a place because there's a union there as to the work in China where the workers are forced  to live on site and they have to install suicide nets.  Hey, I don't give a fuck. 
[01:22:30]  Hold it, though.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I don't give a fuck about the Chinese worker.  I could give a shit about their circumstance.  If they are willing to work on the cheap, it's an option for a company to take their  work there and get cheap labor and have it done.  What the fuck?  The price per item, there were a couple reports that came out not too long ago, and I believe  the price per item on the iPhones and iPads would cost Apple about $2 more apiece to produce 
[01:23:00]  here in the United States.  Something tells me it would be more than $2 if it's so bad.  If it's so bad.  Hold on.  If it's so bad in China and so many people are making nothing and working all these long  hours, how is it only $2 more to keep the job here in the country?  Stop it.  Because when you have to factor in the shipping costs, when you have to factor in all the  duty taxes, you've got to pay on everything.  Duty.  You know that?  Tipping.  All right.  Hilarious. 
[01:23:30]  Let me go.  We've got a union guy, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Keith in Connecticut.  What's up, Keith?  What's going on, guys?  I work for the union, man.  I've been 14 years, and the biggest problem with it, like you're talking about why the  guy won't budge, but once that one guy budges, then the rest of the guys just start dogging  the shit out of them.  Like, I work in the sanitation department.  I drive.  But if I go and complain, or if I'm that guy that budges, the next day and from that  day on, you'll be in the back of the truck.  You're not driving no more.  Because they can't fire you, so they'll just fuck with you until you want to quit. 
[01:24:00]  That's why none of the guys budge.  But you see, like, in that whole culture of that attitude is shitty.  Like, the fact, first of all, the fact they can't fire somebody for being terrible.  Well, you're pretty protected in the union.  Yeah, overprotected.  We all know that.  But that's unreasonable.  And if they're all that unreasonable, then fuck them.  Like, again, if you're asking them to work for free, that's one thing.  But we weren't.  I watched it happen.  And I literally had to have a light on me just to see the color of what I was wearing  and make sure it was okay with the background and it didn't bleed on camera. 
[01:24:30]  And half the problem with the light is that the cues weren't being fired up on time in  the rehearsal.  And that's, you know, the Cleveland Lighting Crew or a lot of the guys that were there.  We brought in guys and trying to work with their guys.  I hate being lumped into the union, but, I mean, I need it for the, you know, I got two  kids.  Sure.  So I need the benefits and everything else.  But it just, it sucks, man.  I don't even tell anybody where I work or what I do because I don't want to be lumped  into those guys.  Have a good day, guys.  Thank you.  But that's what bugs you about the unions. 
[01:25:00]  You do.  I think they're necessary, though, because I don't think business is ever just going to  be generous unless forced to be so.  Yeah.  In most cases, yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  It's human nature, isn't it?  We got a couple entries for the brand new jingle contest.  Ah.  Want to hear a few before we go to break?  Of course you do.  Yes.  Jingle contest.  Basically, we got a jingle contest happening, and we got a prize of $2,000 from Steven Singer  Jewelers.  I hate StevenSinger.com. 
[01:25:30]  Go there today.  And also, you just get a little fame.  You become a little star.  Yeah.  So send in your entries.  They can't be more than 90 seconds.  Trust me.  You send 90 seconds.  We're not even listening.  I got one 90-second one.  It's not on that disc.  Oh, man.  But most people are staying.  It's 90 seconds.  Wait.  There's one that's a minute seven.  Yeah.  Jingle.  Jingle.  Jingles are seconds long.  Have you ever turned on like 10-10 wins? 
[01:26:00]  Maybe the name of the contest is wrong.  Most people are sticking to what you guys suggested, which is, you know, around 30 seconds.  Who decided 90 seconds?  No longer than 90 seconds.  See, people are confusing jingles with song parodies or something.  It's not a song parody.  A jingle is, is, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.  Now these are in no...  Something like that.  That's it.  Now just put the words in there.  Yeah, put words in there.  There you go.  These are in no specific order.  I didn't start with good or start with bad or whatever.  But a lot of these are really long.  These aren't jingles. 
[01:26:30]  People don't get it.  All right, well, here's Kate Allen's entry for the jingle contest.  We don't know why we know his name, but everybody knows his name.  In the middle of the day, anywhere, it's Jerry Shepardini.  It's Jerry Shepardini.  What's the last thing she said? 
[01:27:00]  I think she said Jim Norton's a cunt.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, nice little voice there.  Yeah, a little Zooey Deschanel going on.  A little bit.  Thank you, Kate Allen.  The next entry in the jingle contest is from Mike D.  I only tell you one time, don't fuck me.  I'm Caden Thompson. 
[01:27:30]  Don't you ever try to fuck me.  You do not ruin Chip.  Do not ruin Chip or I will never hear you.  Oh, my God.  It's not really a jingle.  It's not quite a jingle, you know.  You do not ruin Chip. 
[01:28:00]  Do not ruin Chip.  It's almost all.  You do not ruin Chip.  Really?  Do not ruin Chip.  You do not ruin Chip.  Holy fuck, this is awful.  Do not ruin Chip.  It's not a jingle, Travis.  It's not a jingle.  Don't look at me.  I didn't send these in.  Travis, it's not a jingle.  It's funny in the very beginning, but then it was like, right.  I remember from before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you know?  You know?  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  You guys didn't like that? 
[01:28:30]  No.  I just, yeah, it wasn't a jingle.  I like where it came from.  And I think all attacks on SNL are justified, because they are fucking beginning to look  like thieves.  Coke Logic will get us back on track.  Oh, good.  Here's his entry for the jingle contest.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh,  S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, 
[01:29:00]  S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh, S&E, oh.  This isn't the most annoying contest.  This isn't the most annoying contest.  I think we're doing three or four contests at once.  Yeah, yeah, people are confused.  That wasn't a yingle.  No, yingle.  Was he doing a Laurie Anderson there?  I don't know.  Coke Logic, let me know.  Were you doing a Laurie Anderson, the ha, ha, ha, ha, that annoyed the hell out of everyone  a couple weeks ago?  Oh, God.  That was bad.  You should keep it short, though.  I mean, you know, you could still have fun. 
[01:29:30]  You could still do like, hey, it's dinner time with E-Rock.  Like the first ever.  Yeah, right.  Remember, Opey, Anthony, and Norton, too.  Right.  Good times.  Ah, hear this one.  This is a jingle.  Yes.  Anthony, and Norton, too.  Good times, great hits, XF-202.  Suck my fucking cock.  See there.  Suck my fucking cock. 
[01:30:00]  What was that, 13 seconds?  That's what we're looking for.  That's a good one.  All right, let's try another one.  This is the brand new jingle contest.  That's from the past one.  Here's Brian Hoff's entry.  One is a pedophile, the other one's a dick.  Third one sits at home pulling on his prick.  But when they get together, it's lots of fun.  It's Opey and Anthony for everyone.  Perfect.  There you go.  Perfect.  That's a jingle.  Oh, wait.  It continues. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, no.  What?  That was good.  See, that would have been perfect right there.  People love the sounds of their own voices.  Oh, why?  They kept going?  Yeah.  That was the perfect length for a yingle.  A yingle.  That was 13 seconds.  You ready for this?  It has another 53 seconds.  No.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't.  Why would they do that?  They nailed it right there.  Oh, my God.  Anthony is drowning his troubles in beer.  Trying to prove his daddy wrong, that he's no queer. 
[01:31:00]  Loud, angry racist spreading fear and hate.  Who will take your 17-year-old on a date?  Aw.  Hope he is a digital media whore.  YouTube or Twitter, what does he love more?  Even though he's the only one with kids and a wife, if you are a bad guest, he'll try to ruin your life.  Hope he's radio.  Jimmy, Bill, Edgar, Ted, Chip, Shepardini.  He likes a gal with an unclipped weave.  Jimmy's a creep, but he's oh so cute until he's licking on a Craigslist hooker's poop. 
[01:31:30]  One is a pedophile, the other one's a dick.  Third one sits at home pulling on his prick.  But when they get together, it's lots of fun.  It's Opie and Anthony for everyone.  You know what?  I like it now.  That's pretty good.  It's catchy.  That's more of a theme song.  Yes.  For a theme song contest.  Yes.  There's a lot of contests going on.  Can we have a side fucking prize for the theme song? 
[01:32:00]  This is a sound contest.  That's pretty good right there.  That was pretty good.  We have talented listeners.  But the first few seconds was what we're looking for.  That had the makings of a yingle.  Don't say yingle anymore.  Oh, fuck.  Don't do it.  Why?  Why do you do this?  A yingle.  A yingle.  What are we going to do?  That was a good theme song.  Yeah, it was good.  I liked the whole thing there.  Well, it adheres to the rules. 
[01:32:30]  Put that in the finalist's folder.  But does it sound like a jingle?  No.  It doesn't?  It sounds like a theme song.  Yeah.  A yingle is supposed to be very short.  With stingers and such.  Here's Ramsey Norman.  His entry into the jingle contest.  Oh, that's terrible. 
[01:33:00]  That's terrible.  That's horrible.  I love ruining people's dreams.  Because you know they're like, I sent it in.  Now I've got to listen.  Maybe they'll play mine.  And then theirs gets played.  And you think they're turning up the radio?  Dude, I remember being this guy. 
[01:33:30]  That's why.  I remember being the guy listening to the radio and being like, oh, fuck.  This is mine.  This is mine.  And it's like, that sucks.  And then you just crushed.  You're crushed.  What's your feedback on the last one we just heard?  It's terrible.  It stinks.  Fuck that guy.  You didn't like it?  No.  You just crushed it.  It wasn't a good yingle.  It has to be 15, 20 seconds.  That is appropriate. 
[01:34:00]  Yingle.  Well, we'll play more later on.  That's pretty good.  We got 10 today.  So that's the first five.  10.  There were a couple of good ones in there, though.  I don't know if they were jingles, but they were certainly creative and good.  All right.  Email yours in to opianthony at SiriusXM.com.  Opianthony at SiriusXM.com.  Good.  And all that info is on the Facebook page, right?  Mm-hmm.  And it's $2,000 to the winner.  Two Gs.  Do we have follow-up prizes?  No.  No runner-up prizes? 
[01:34:30]  No.  What about a gift certificate for Wednesday night at a fucking...  Actually, I got a $10 Subway gift card.  Oh, there you go.  Can we throw that in there?  That's the first prize, yeah.  Why wouldn't we have prizes for second and third place?  Yeah, something.  That's what Steven Singer gave us.  We could maybe get some more.  Not from Steven.  Yeah, we could get just other things.  No, this is Steven Singer's contest.  No.  I don't understand.  You know, let's give something from across the street on Walnut.  Aw, shit.  Jewelry Wars.  I see a new reality show. 
[01:35:00]  I've got my ring for a lower price than you've got your ring.  I heard that fucking other place isn't even there anymore, right?  That's what I heard.  The other corner is a Starbucks.  The other corner is a garage.  And the other corner, maybe that's where it is.  Oh.  Because I'm not sure of the other corner.  But I know that right across the street is the Starbucks.  Oh, see?  And then the garage is on the other side.  That would be the southwest corner.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  The southeast corner is the Starbucks.  What is on the northwest corner?  That is the question today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chucktober next.  Oh, God.  Wow.  The open entry show.  There is no you.  There is only me.  There is no fucking you.  There is no you.  Language.  Jimmy.  There is no you.  What was he doing? 
[01:36:00]  Fucking with Iraq?  He made Iraq just turn down the music for no reason.  He was waving him off, like doing the throat thing.  Like, no, we got this.  I don't know if people heard that out there.  It was subtle.  Poor chubby little lad.  Jimmy.  He made the move of his little fingers.  Nice.  Beyonce performing at the Super Bowl.  Is that a good move?  They ran out of people, I guess, huh?  I think so.  I think it was much bigger.  McCartney, Beyonce.  Sure.  Whatever.  Whatever. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Was it McCartney last year?  No.  The Who.  Who was it last year?  Tom Petty?  I guess they want young people to tune in.  I mean, young people don't care about the Who.  Right.  Or Kiss.  Kiss just played it.  Who's the...  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who are you?  Who are you talking about my...  All right.  All right.  Who played the Super Bowl last year?  It was only a while ago. 
[01:37:00]  It was McCartney a few years ago.  It was Kiss a few years ago.  It was Aerosmith recently.  Tom Petty?  Tom Petty.  Bruce Springsteen recently.  Springsteen?  Hold on.  Don't say it, Sam.  I'm going to get it.  Madonna?  Madonna?  Who was it last year?  I forgot.  It was Madonna.  It was Madonna, yeah.  So they go Madonna to Beyonce.  You know what?  Not a huge Madonna fan, but I do believe Sam is going to hurt you.  It's a bit of a drop-off.  Well, it's not a drop-off.  It's a drop-off.  It's about using a contemporary artist.  So why don't they go with Katy Perry?  Yeah.  Because Beyonce's way bigger than Katy Perry.  Stop it.  No, she isn't.  Right now?  Is she more hit than Katy Perry? 
[01:37:30]  No.  Her body of work is bigger than Katy Perry.  Katy Perry bigger than Beyonce.  Right now.  Oh, yeah.  Beyonce might be bigger than the fucking trunk.  Yeah.  Katy Perry.  Those breasts.  Katy Perry bigger than Beyonce right now.  Beyonce's got a bigger career than Katy Perry.  I'm talking.  Come and fucking.  Come on.  As far as people who are performing actively now, like, and putting out new music, there's  not very many people who are bigger.  I would have loved to know in the show.  Hey, look, somebody could have put fucking, uh, that goddamn, uh, uh, wait, what's a dumb 
[01:38:00]  band from the 70s?  The Starland Vocal Band back in the 70s could have played the Super Bowl and been like, wow,  this is great.  The Starland Vocal Band.  Doesn't mean they're bigger than anybody else now.  I'm talking right now.  At the moment?  Beyonce or Katy Perry?  Katy Perry's bigger than Beyonce right now.  Katy Perry's last album was more successful than Beyonce's last album.  Exactly.  So that means she's hotter right now.  How about you get Lady Gaga?  You know, she's a little too crazy.  She's a little too crazy. 
[01:38:30]  She's a live one.  They don't need another fucking episode like that.  Janet Jackson.  Can't have that nipple slip again.  Eighth of a second nipple.  And Beyonce is able to.  It's the country we live in.  I know.  It's so stupid.  Beyonce is able to actually do something that a larger group of people can watch.  Katy Perry appeals only to children.  Who was the.  Then call me.  Then fucking paint me a child.  Paint me.  Sam's not wrong on that point. 
[01:39:00]  What's the short list?  Who else were they considering?  They put that out there?  I don't know if they put that out the short list.  I'm just thinking of everyone.  Beyonce is a weird choice.  Really?  She's huge.  So why wouldn't Jay-Z do it?  Play Beyonce's most popular song right now.  What is it?  Play her the song that.  When people hear it, they go, oh, obviously.  That's Beyonce's biggest hit ever. 
[01:39:30]  Crazy Love is probably her biggest hit ever.  Play Crazy Love, V-Rock.  No, that's ever, though.  That's ever.  This one.  Oh, this is Jay-Z.  It's Jay-Z.  Right?  Why does he have to intro his broad song?  That's all he's doing.  I want to hear her part.  He's got a verse on it, too.  No, he doesn't.  This stinks.  It's a stink.  And a lot of people ain't going to know this.  This song?  Yeah.  You're nuts.  No, that's a big hit.  Now play fireworks. 
[01:40:00]  This is my favorite part.  I turned you on to fireworks.  You're mentioning it way too much.  And by the way, Single Ladies.  What?  Single Ladies?  That's a much more recent, enormous song.  And she only needs to play for, what, seven minutes, something like that?  Yeah.  Who run the world?  Girls.  Girls.  Yeah, this is a big song.  This is big.  She'll do all right.  I just feel like there's other people out there.  Jay-Z would be better than her.  Jay-Z's more polarizing.  What about Lil Wayne?  Lil Wayne.  Lil Wayne.  I'm at the Super Bowl. 
[01:40:30]  That's a Lil Wayne.  Are you performing at the Super Bowl?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did you sign a contract?  I don't know.  Did you win a Grammy?  I don't know.  Possibly.  I don't recall.  Possibly.  I don't recall.  What's his name?  You put the perception on me.  That was some good audio.  People perceive what they want to perceive.  They want to perceive.  Why are we bitching all the time?  Beyonce is a fine choice, whatever.  She's a perfect choice.  She's not a perfect choice.  I disagree.  Who's better?  I don't like it.  Yeah, the problem is.  Kate Perry would be better.  No, not at all.  I started this whole thing, and I can't come up with someone that actually would be better. 
[01:41:00]  Lady Gaga.  Katy Perry, maybe.  Katy Perry.  No, not Katy Perry.  She's got big tits.  Listen to this song, Sam.  She's got big tits.  She's not even that fucking good.  That might fuck her up.  Katy Perry's not good.  This song is inspirational.  Jimmy wants everyone to look at him, because he's about to fucking give head to his banana.  He's just been waiting.  Fucking Jimmy.  You think I was waiting?  Look at him.  He's waiting.  He's got yogurt on the tip of his banana.  And he's been looking around the roof for like a minute, waiting. 
[01:41:30]  There he goes.  Oh, God.  There's yogurt.  There's plain yogurt on the tip of the banana, and he just put his hand on the back of his  head and shoved his face onto it.  You didn't notice for the longest time.  He's sitting there just waiting for everyone to pay attention so he can do his move.  This song is inspirational, Sam.  No, it's not inspirational.  It really is.  It's very bass.  You've got to just be yourself, man.  It gives a fuck what the bullies are saying.  Right.  Right.  Even if you're chubby, who gives a fuck? 
[01:42:00]  Jump in that pool.  Jump in that pool, Sam.  This is not a good song.  Stop.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  You like that.  Fucking Iraq making a kick in.  Iraq, turn the volume up.  Of course he did.  Because he should be fired for more.  Let me ask Z-Rock something.  I don't mean that either.  Does this song talk to you, Iraq? 
[01:42:30]  It talks to you, right?  A little bit?  No, not really.  Yeah, not really.  Yeah, no.  She would not be nearly the Super Bowl halftime performer that Beyonce will be.  She would blow Madonna out of the water.  I could have blown Madonna out of the water doing covers.  She stunk.  Yeah, she was terrible.  Well, if no one's going to come up with another artist, then so be it.  That's what it is.  Perfect choice.  Oh, by the way, remember yesterday we were talking about Rolling Stones, the Rolling Stones,  waiting on a friend?  Yeah.  And you know how they're sitting in front of that fucking building? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  What happened?  It's a big...  No, no, I'm just laughing at it.  What happened?  It's a...  People know that building, right?  Isn't that like a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is it?  There's a connection to another band.  Really?  Fuck, why don't I favorite some of these tweets?  Because I didn't even think we were going to fucking do this right now.  What's the Zeppelin...  And I'm a Zeppelin fan, but...  Is it Houses of the Holy?  Houses of the Holy?  Where it has the building on the front cover? 
[01:43:30]  Tell me out.  Fucking Zeppelin.  Oh, no, that's...  I'm not listening to you.  Physical Graffiti, of course it is.  Of course.  I'm sorry.  I should know that.  That's the same fucking building.  Is it?  Yeah.  No way, Jose.  Yeah, man.  The Rolling Stones.  If you look at Physical Graffiti, you see the stoop and the steps on the wall.  The bottom right corner?  Yeah.  That's the waiting on the friends?  I'm just standing and a doll wife. 
[01:44:00]  I didn't know that.  I like those little fucking...  Where is it?  Show the other one, though, Sam.  I know you're not showing.  Why don't you get the picture from the other video and now put them side by side?  Here's the problem with Twitter.  There's some fucking weird shit that happens.  Because now I'm going to go and try to find this tweet, okay?  Because it was very early this morning.  I guarantee this tweet's gone for some reason.  Oh, man.  I don't know what happens with some of these fucking tweets.  They disappear.  Oh, here it is.  No.  Oh, go to Night Night Juice gets the big plug today on Twitter. 
[01:44:30]  Night Night Juice.  Night Night Juice.  Sam, go to Night Night Juice.  Because that's going to get you to the website that explains the whole fucking thing.  Because he tweeted about this shit.  You like the fireworks?  Oh, it's so catchy.  You like it.  You got a guilty pleasure, sir.  All right.  Here it is.  It's off a website called Feel Nump.  There's the physical graffiti album cover.  Yeah.  All right.  And that's what the building actually looks like. 
[01:45:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  That's, you know.  And then keep going down.  Now.  Every brownstone in New York.  Yeah.  I think it's, uh...  That's it, though.  I want to say it's in the East Village, I would guess.  Yeah.  And then it keeps going down, showing different fucking pictures of that building.  Keep going down there, Sam.  Keep going down.  Keep going down.  You don't like that?  Look at that.  Look at that right there.  All right.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  And I see.  That's the waiting on the friend fucking video. 
[01:45:30]  And they used the same building from the physical graffiti album cover.  Who lives in the rock and roll building?  That's wild.  Ah!  Yeah, he's waiting on the...  So don't even ask them why he's there.  What's the website for the people that give a fuck?  He's waiting on a friend, though.  It's a...  You just go to the guy's Twitter.  FeelNumb.com is the website that...  It's an article on there from 2009.  Tweeted.  So, there you go.  You don't give a fuck about this stuff, Sam?  No, no, no.  You don't give a fuck about rock history, do you? 
[01:46:00]  I don't give a fuck about Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones.  I mean, the Rolling Stones are right, but...  Oh, my God.  Oh, these kids...  Oh, the Rolling Stones are just all right?  Yeah, I don't care.  Better than all right.  Did you like any rock growing up?  White Zombie.  That's not rock.  The Rock.  I mean, it is rock, but I mean, it's not like traditional rock.  The first album I got was Permanent Vacation by Aerosmith.  I used to listen to that album all the time.  Oh, yeah?  It's the only one I had, though.  What was the big song off that?  Dude Looks Like a Lady.  Dude Looks Like a Lady.  That.  That. 
[01:46:30]  No, you didn't like that?  Randall was on that album.  I like this song.  You didn't like this one?  What?  It's a guitar.  Yeah, I'm not going to fucking argue with you on that one.  I used to listen to it all the time and read the lyrics.  Oh, man.  What else was on this?  This is job site fucking radio.  Was it really?  Yeah, this was like, I guess after Howard went off, K-Rock would play this shit, and I would  just crank it on the job site.  Yeah, Samara Smith.  I think...  Ragdoll was on this album. 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  That's a good song.  That's all right.  I like that.  That's about a girl having a period, right?  I don't know.  Is it?  Oh, right.  I thought it was.  Dude looks like a lady.  And then they used the song in Mrs. Doubtfire.  Oh, did Mrs. Doubtfire dance around to it?  Yes, she did.  They really did?  Oh, yeah, they did.  I'm a woman.  I'm just like a woman.  I have titties.  That was a very funny movie.  You know what?  Mrs. Doubtfire was a good movie.  Really?  Yeah, it was fine.  I don't remember anymore. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really don't know that one.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we do some Jack-tober?  The people are asking for it today.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're doing some Jack-tober.  It's Jack-tober.  Jack-tober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jack-tober. 
[01:48:00]  O-M-G.  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jack-tober.  I got a tree on my house.  Are you peppering in the Scott sound bites yet?  Yeah, some of the interns.  Well, we only have the one intern, but he's on the case.  I got a tree on my house.  He's on the case, right?  I know today's Terry Clifford Day. 
[01:48:30]  I know it is.  I also think, by the way, that there's some D.W.E. folks that are listening to this show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they chose now, in the month of Jock-tober, to do a random WWE.com thing on all the things  Todd Pettengale did with them.  Really?  And they put up a whole bunch of embarrassing, like, Todd clips.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Isn't that just called Todd clips?  Todd Pettengale.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I wish his last name was Todd Pettenfile. 
[01:49:00]  That'd be much more fun to talk about.  It really would be.  Yesterday's October was very good.  Yeah.  So hopefully we can keep the energy going.  Well, we're going back to the United States of America.  Nice.  To Washington, D.C., the heart of the country.  Oh.  You know, I figured, you know, the debate going on last night, very political.  Very good.  Look, you're thinking.  Now, this isn't the guy we know, right?  No.  He works here.  No.  He's a good guy.  Because I don't want the same mistake that happened last year.  Tragic. 
[01:49:30]  No.  This is not.  Because I know a guy by this name, and he's an all-right dude.  We're going to the Kane show.  Okay.  But it's not the Kane that kind of does some work around here.  The one who used to work at K-Rock New York.  Okay.  No.  He's a good guy.  I like Kane.  I don't want to fuck with him.  Is this WWE Kane?  Maybe.  That I'm not sure about.  It's a hot 99.5, the Kane show in Washington, D.C.  Yes.  And now, what's the makeup of this show?  What are we looking at as far as the players?  Well, one of the guys is just a question mark.  What is that about? 
[01:50:00]  I have no idea what that's about, because I really only hear two voices.  I see all these pictures, but I hear that many voices.  I think it's like an Elvis Duran Jr. situation.  Kane is trying to set up this little morning zoo army around him.  But he sucks, so it's difficult.  He sucks, really?  Yeah.  Is he worse than Scott and Todd?  I'll let you guys be the judge, you know?  I don't want to cloud your judgment.  All right.  I see two clips on this that it...  Don't spoil.  I'm not, but it makes me so angry. 
[01:50:30]  Not really.  Yes, because it's something we...  These idiots should listen to us.  We're trying to actually help them in the end.  Don't they understand this?  This is help.  It's like you tear down their...  There's two tracks.  It's a bit that we said, don't do this bit anymore.  It's like you tear down their entire show.  And it's not The Fugitive, by the way, because I'm sure a lot of people are saying Fugitive.  I don't think so.  It's another one we've brought up a lot on this show.  You tear down their entire show, and in the midst of all the rubble,  Obi's face is around the corner going, I did this for you. 
[01:51:00]  Has anyone learned?  No.  After being featured on Jacktober?  Absolutely.  There was a one guy...  I'm allowing these shows out there that we've beat the shit out of to admit to us that we actually helped them in the end.  And I want to know how they changed after their beating.  There was the one guy a couple years ago who started getting a lot more snippy with the chick on his show.  Yeah, I know.  Remember that?  Oh, that was great.  But other than that, no.  No, huh?  We go back and feature the same show.  Refuse to fucking change. 
[01:51:30]  Kane talks about a trial.  Sarah interjects.  Is Sarah a typical hole?  Sarah's just the female voice of reason on the show.  Who's there to kind of, you know...  Wow, that's a great novel idea.  A woman that's the voice of reason on a show.  Why don't more people do that?  The update this week.  Poor Nathan Wilburn.  He actually went on TV.  You remember?  We actually talked about this.  He went on TV and stood by his wife. 
[01:52:00]  The teacher that supposedly slept with all these students.  And he says she wouldn't do that.  She'd never do that.  Yes, she's a Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader.  But the only reason people are accusing her of this is because they're jealous of how hot my wife is.  Oh, she's so hot.  You're right.  She's pretty attractive.  So, the update to this is with the trial this week.  She ended up walking out of one of the trials after she made a plea deal.  Holding the hand of the 18-year-old student that she was first accused of sleeping with. 
[01:52:30]  Shut the front door.  So, they're still together.  Oh, shut the front door.  That's interesting.  Shut the fuck up.  Yeah, shut the front door.  Shut the front door.  Well, they're working around the rules that are in place, Jim Norton.  You can't say shut the fuck up.  Oh, my God.  Is that fucking horrible?  What a stupid front door.  How about you shut up?  Shut up.  Yeah.  No, shut the front door, man.  I bet half of Washington is saying that at this point.  That is fucking terrible. 
[01:53:00]  Shut the front door.  What an embarrassing country would have a woman like that in its yard.  Wow, I see what you did there.  Very, very clever.  Shut the front door.  Well, we continue with the Kane Show.  Has good wishes for a caller and celebrates because it's her first time calling.  That's right.  Who gives a fuck if it's your first time calling?  It's something they do.  Another thing I hate when radio shows do it.  First time, long time.  Oh, God.  Who gives a fuck? 
[01:53:30]  First time, long time.  I love first time, long time.  I appreciate our calls, but who gives a fuck?  Who used to do that?  The fan?  Out of hand.  First time, long time.  Yeah.  Yeah, first time, long time.  Dog, I just want to talk about...  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Have you...  Another thing I didn't realize we were going to talk about until you just said that.  Have you seen the Vince McMahon slash Mike Francesa little fucking clip?  No.  God, I gotta favorite this shit.  It's Vince McMahon walking into the arena toward the ring, but they put Mike Francesa's head on the... 
[01:54:00]  Why?  Why?  Whoever tweeted that to me, if you're listening right now, please send it again.  I gotta show these guys.  Travis is running down the hall.  He knows it.  Oh, here comes Travis.  Oh, he's quitting.  You've seen this?  It's so stupid.  And it's the dumbest thing.  It's literally two, three seconds long.  It's so dumb.  It's the Mike Francesa of Vince McMahon, Jeff. 
[01:54:30]  Why is he doing that?  Why not?  Why not is the answer.  I'm sure Mike will hate it.  You know, I sit here hard and they put me walking into a ring like with a suit on.  If that's what you want to do, that's up to you.  I love the Vince swagger.  Vince's arms are just going like Vince.  With Mike Francesa's stupid fucking big fucking skull.  With sunglasses on.  The more you want it, the better it gets.  You like it? 
[01:55:00]  I do like that.  It's so dumb.  Sometimes it's the simple things.  Can we put that on the Facebook page?  Makes no sense.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Kane Show, Jocktober.  Hey, Kim, good morning.  How are you?  Good morning, Kane.  How are you?  I'm doing wonderfully.  Thank you so much for asking.  Kim, you're on your way to a job interview today.  Is that true?  Yes, I'm on my way to Baltimore right now for an interview.  Here we go.  You'll get it.  You know how this works.  You know what we do, right?  We got to help.  Yes, I do.  Everyone take a moment to concentrate on our show. 
[01:55:30]  Everybody look at a microphone that's in front of you and focus and give Kim good juju for  her interview today.  Good juju.  All right.  Today's going to go well.  Thank you so much, Aaron Kane.  Kill it, girl.  Don't forget Melanie and Eric and Scott, who's newly married.  Look at Scott with his wedding ring on.  And you better ask questions.  You got to ask questions.  Okay.  What?  First time caller.  Yay!  Well, good luck.  Call us tomorrow.  Tell us how it goes, okay?  What happened there?  I don't know. 
[01:56:00]  No, I'm serious.  What happened?  They give good juju if you need it.  The ju?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh.  No.  No, I'm sending an isometric.  Oh, it's not ju.  And what does the fart sound effect have to do with them?  I don't know.  They were pushing out all the energy towards her and, oops, somebody let one go.  Oh, that's where the funny is.  Funny.  And then they all cheer because it's the first time the lady's called the show on the phone.  That's funny.  And everybody goes, yeah, cool. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  St. Mark's Place between First Avenue and Avenue A.  Thank you.  Oh.  Physical graffiti's cover.  Fuck it.  Sorry.  Physical graffiti's cover.  I was just looking at Lance Armstrong.  Yeah.  He's a dick.  He stepped down as the Livestrong Foundation Chairman.  Did he start that?  Yeah.  And Nike is discontinuing there.  And Nike.  He's so fucked.  Just admit it, you fucking asshole.  Enough of this guy already. 
[01:57:00]  Pompous douche.  He's got to step forward and now explain.  Just admit it.  What that sport is really about.  Because he's not the only one.  The articles I've read, pretty much everyone was doping.  Not making it right, but he wasn't the only fucking guy.  Yeah.  Just admit it.  Yeah.  It's like after a while it becomes just, everyone's like, oh, go fuck yourself.  Right.  When you're that busted, just admit it.  I don't know what goes on on this show.  What show?  The Kane show in D.C.  And I swear to God, I forgot we were doing that. 
[01:57:30]  Well, on the Facebook page, one of their listeners posted a picture of the dinosaurs from Land Before Time having sex with each other.  Yeah, that's crazy.  And then, this is just weird.  There's a picture of Anthony with a Nazi armband pointing a gun at the president.  That's crazy.  That says, vote Kumia for president.  And there's Jim Norton clapping in the background and some dicks.  Oh, shut the front door.  Oh, that's a good one.  It's obviously photos.  What is that?  Oh, God.  What is that?  Oh, that's terrible.  What the fuck am I looking at? 
[01:58:00]  The girl has a penis in her mouth and there's feces on her face.  So much.  She's a good girl.  This show's sick.  Terrible.  I don't know what these listeners do.  That's a sick show, right?  I wish they would stop putting our faces in these things.  This is just humiliating.  They're bullying us.  I don't like being bullied like this.  Yeah.  Don't put pictures of me where Fat E-Rock's squeezing his tits.  Yeah, leave E-Rock out of this.  It always goes back to E-Rock.  Does E-Rock not like that picture? 
[01:58:30]  E-Rock, do you like that picture?  Do you appreciate the FatERock.com website?  Not at all.  Oh, wow.  What a fuddy-duddy.  A cartoon image of young E-Rock riding his refrigerator.  Kane talks about a prostitution story but goes a little too...  People were knocking on the back door of the Zumba place and they would come in and they  would leave very sweaty and they weren't doing any of the exercises in the main part 
[01:59:00]  of the building.  They were doing them in the back.  So Alexis Wright is a 29-year-old Zumba instructor who apparently was doing...  This is the story.  A lot more working out than just in her studio.  She pleaded guilty to 106 counts of prostitution, violation of privacy, tax evasion, and other  charges for allegedly providing relations for money.  She pleaded not guilty to 59 of the counts of prostitution, which means the other ones...  Oh, my gosh. 
[01:59:30]  She's a beautiful woman.  Yeah, she is.  Doesn't look like she's from Maine, though.  She looks...  Yeah, it's...  What?  Doesn't look like she's from Maine.  What's that supposed to mean?  I guess that didn't come out the right way.  She doesn't look like a plain Jane.  Well, no, no, no, no, no.  She looks exotic.  Will you let the guy at least try to do something that might end up being funny?  Uh, but...  Do you understand the concept?  Dink!  Shut the fuck up.  They're terrible.  They really are.  What do you mean? 
[02:00:00]  Hey!  Not the worst thing to say.  I gotta stick up for Kane there.  He's going for something.  Going, oh, usually they're a bunch of fucking pigs up there in Maine.  Yeah, exactly.  Ugh.  That's not right, though.  There's people who look...  Oh, my God.  I mean...  How could he get anything done if she's doing that?  She is right, though.  There are lots of different types of people in Maine.  That's something Kane may not have realized.  Is space too, um...  Happening?  What's the chat room like?  That's pretty cool.  I'd like to see what people are saying about the show.  Oh, there's a chat room during the show?  There's actually a live...  Yeah.  Oh! 
[02:00:30]  There's a live cam and a chat room.  How many people are in there?  It doesn't say the number.  It's only a few right now.  It's very sparse.  Yeah.  Not many people.  It's not really scrolling that fast.  How do you get to that?  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, I just went to hot995.com.  Oh, okay.  And yeah, and just went to the webcam.  Oh, wow, that's cool.  There's a live webcam.  That is kind of cool.  Interesting.  Sarah reminds Kane about diversity, people.  Aw.  And what I meant by that, Sarah, is she looks...  Oh, God.  Now he's got a fucking placate to her. 
[02:01:00]  I saw as an update on the webcam, he looked concerned, and he was looking at his computer,  was Kane?  Oh, yeah.  And we've entered into phase two.  The public wall has been shut down on the Facebook page.  Why?  Oh.  However, they put up, like, a Christmas thing.  Oh, that's nice.  I swear it's never gets it.  It's the same thing every single time.  With his crown on.  Jingle Bell Dubstep is the name of the video. 
[02:01:30]  Ah!  Oh, cool.  I like Dubstep.  And one of the comments is from Jeremy Sandusky that says, put a finger in my ass.  Aw.  Well, Sarah reminds Kane about diversity.  I guess he has to now explain his main comment.  Yeah, of course.  And what I meant by that, Sarah, is she looks, she looks possibly like she has, she's got  some Hispanic bloodlines, and she's got dark hair and dark skin.  Most people from Maine are a little bit pale.  What are you talking about?  And she's teaching Zumba, which is Latin dance exercise, basically. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, you know, yes, that too.  So there you go, Frey.  Thank you.  There's diversity now in Maine, you guys.  Well, there's only 17 people in the entire state, so.  Now you guys are like, what?  No.  No.  God, most girls just suck.  They fucking ruin every radio show.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Oh, guys.  Oh, you guys.  Oh, guys.  I didn't think our parodies of the whole could be as accurate as they are. 
[02:02:30]  I know, you feel like you're, like, exaggerating a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, but then you realize.  You guys.  Sure.  They're really doing that.  I'm glad that somebody on this Facebook has some decency.  Yeah.  One person, this guy Pete writes,  I thought this was a family-safe show.  These comments are horrible.  Oh, wow.  And it's true.  Pete's right.  These listeners are disgusting.  It's a family-safe show.  The chat room, at least, I hope people are respectful.  Oh, my gosh.  What?  Terry Clifford.  Terry!  Aw.  But one person named Ryan, he writes, 
[02:03:00]  This show loves naked babies.  If that's true, I don't even know.  Oh, that's crazy.  What is the chat room doing in the live feed?  I hope people are being respectful in there.  Oh, that's scrolling a little faster.  Yeah, there's no, I don't know if, uh...  They might have to approve.  Oh, Jerry Shepardini and Mimi Beardsley is coming in.  Oh, there's Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, there it goes.  Somebody wrote, Hi, Sam.  Oh, what's that about?  That's very strange, but...  Welcome to Jacktober.  Kane looks very stressed.  Kane is sitting there with his head down.  Oh, wow. 
[02:03:30]  We rocked his fat.  Who would write that?  It's not some guy named Jerry Shepardini.  Jack Dunphy is full of shit.  The guy doesn't even want to look at the fucking webcam.  A minute ago, he was looking at the Facebook,  and his mouth, you could tell the word that came out of his mouth was,  Wow.  Why would Jerry Shepardini write, Fuck you?  That doesn't make any sense.  Why would he do that?  Oh, man. 
[02:04:00]  Go back into the ER, and she's at the loser.  This is live.  Oh, this is live.  This guy writes, Happy Jacktober, cut faces.  While they're broadcasting.  Cut faces.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley writes, I happen to have a tree on my house.  I got a tree off.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  That has just become the definition of jock-tober.  Yes. 
[02:04:30]  That clip, it says it all.  If there is ever a jock-tober flag, the words, I have a tree on my house.  I have a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  Yeah.  Everyone knows that.  Bubba's security cam says, shut the front door.  Bubba's security cam.  You want to hear more of this show?  Please.  Yeah.  I mean, now we got some guy coming in.  He rushed in.  Obviously, Kane is like, will somebody control this Facebook situation? 
[02:05:00]  They're in the chat.  Well, Ronnie Ronnie says, lots of new peeps in one sitting.  Ronnie Ronnie is noticing Bubba's security camera saying, we need backup.  Check out Facebook real quick.  Uh-oh.  Still doing good.  Nice.  Lots of comments on stuff.  Good.  A lot of loyal listeners.  Keep it respectful, though, guys.  Yeah, please.  Sam Houdini-Shepardini writes, phase two, go.  Sam, what is time for the Kane scam?  Well, you've heard of phone scams, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  But you can't do fake phone calls anymore. 
[02:05:30]  How do you mean?  Or wait, you can't do prank phone calls.  You're not allowed to prank people.  You're absolutely not allowed to do prank phone calls.  You can't record people when they don't know it.  And if they know it, it's not a prank call.  Right.  So what is this Kane scam all about?  Wait, did the guy just leave?  Where'd he go?  Oh, yeah.  They went to a camera that was pointing at a chair with nobody in it.  Oh, no.  That's a...  Because we were looking at him.  And look. 
[02:06:00]  There's no sound.  No sound.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  I potted them up.  Oh, boy.  Let's listen to...  Well, we got sound, thank God.  Thank God.  Yeah, we got a little bit of the show.  So time for a Kane scam.  Jim Norton special.  Please be offended.  It's on Netflix.  Why would they put that in the room?  That's very nice.  Jerry Shepardini.  Obviously, some crossover listeners.  All right, here we go.  The Kane scam.  We love these prank phone calls.  Oh, please.  We used to do a few of them in our day.  People live for these things.  Yep.  Hey, who's the hole? 
[02:06:30]  Don't put it on the girl.  That's a terrible place to put the girl.  Oh, no.  Someone wrote, hole cap.  I wish they hadn't put the camera on her.  Oh, no.  Wow.  She looks like she might not be a girl.  She's from Maine.  She's wearing flannel, a fucking Bob Vila vest.  What do you mean she looks like she's from Maine?  Shut the front door, lady.  That's her?  Come back.  We meet my arse.  I'm looking for a celebrity.  Nice tablecloth shirt.  Who is this bitch?  Ronnie doesn't know who Jim Norton is. 
[02:07:00]  Come on.  This is great.  And they figured out that if you space out the syllables or letters that you can curse.  You can get the word cunt in the chat room.  Yeah.  You know what?  None of them are looking at the webcast anymore.  Why would they write that?  What an awful person.  Okay, this person's screen name is actually Jock Toba.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Nice.  Great name.  There's a cunt in the way of that microphone.  People are very mean-spirited.  I like turtles. 
[02:07:30]  Anthony Cumia.  House tree, the guy's name is.  One person named Anthony Cumia writes, vote Romney.  Anthony, are you in this chat room?  Oh, man.  I'm typing away.  This is not the time or place.  Get them clothes off or get on the air.  Someone writes, shut the cunt door.  Shut the cunt door.  Hey, it's Kurt Cobain.  That's good.  It is Kurt Cobain.  It's wow day.  I love how they're making believe they're real busy.  They refuse to acknowledge they're being taken over.  They're not looking at the webcast.  Oh, no.  Why don't we play the Cain Scam? 
[02:08:00]  Let's hear that.  In the middle of October, the Cain Show in Washington, D.C., hot 99.5.  Cain Scams, hello.  Oh, Allie wrote us an email.  She wants to Cain Scam her brother, Dan.  She just gave him her old cell phone and cell phone number.  And she writes, what's the worst thing a sister can do to a brother?  And having a sister that's two years younger, I would say probably stripping naked.  Oh, boy.  And your brother finding out about it.  So we called Dan's cell phone, which used to belong to Allie. 
[02:08:30]  And we left a message reminding her that the photo shoot doesn't have to be completely nude.  He's been trying to get in touch with her.  This is what happened when we called Dan with Allie on the phone.  Allie.  Hello?  This might be real, by the way.  You're able to do that.  I think you're able to do this type of call.  You're able to do it that way.  Well, at least one party knows they're being recorded.  I think so.  Allie.  Hello? 
[02:09:00]  Hey.  Hey.  I saw that you, I missed your call.  It's not real.  Yeah.  You missed all my calls.  Where the hell are you?  I'm at a second.  Oh, it's not real.  Wow.  Hey.  Yeah, I didn't get nervous when you told me that there was a lot.  Fuck, it's so not real.  It's, it's, it's actors.  It's fake.  They're acting badly.  No one talks like that.  No one.  One person's right, double guns, go to fucking break in the chat room.  Hey, can you ever slap that hole with a crowbar? 
[02:09:30]  Crowbar?  Why?  Why would you want to do that?  Take me out, fatty.  Somebody writes that.  Allie.  Hello?  Hey.  Hey, I saw that you, I missed your call.  Yeah, you missed all my calls.  Where the hell are you?  I'm at a thing.  Hey, doll.  What are you doing right now?  Time is money.  Time is money.  Let's get it on.  I got stuff I got.  I got other people I have to do.  I'll be off the phone in just a second.  I have a peacock.  I'll be on the train. 
[02:10:00]  I'll be on the train later on today.  This is a photographer.  It's a thing I'm doing.  A photographer.  I told you, I'm doing, I'm doing a thing.  Somebody called your phone about being fully nude.  You're telling me it's a photographer.  What are you doing?  No, it's not fully nude.  Oh, God.  What are you doing that's even partially nude?  What's the matter with you?  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  What are you doing right now?  I'm going to take pictures of you while you're on the phone, so I want you to do a little  action shot.  Just pretend like you're just talking on the phone to like a boyfriend and just look seductant.  Put your finger in him.  Yes.  Put your finger in your mouth.  Just like that.  Put your finger in your mouth. 
[02:10:30]  Put your finger in your mouth.  Just like that.  All right.  Bend over.  What are you doing?  Just stand.  Just stand.  Just stand.  What are you doing?  Just like that.  Bend over.  Just like that.  Okay.  Just like that.  Oh, you can hear the camera.  Lift up the skirt so we see your butt cheek a little bit.  Don't lift up any skirt.  What are you doing?  Hold on.  Are you insane?  What's the matter?  Are you taking naked things right now?  This is terrible.  Oh, God.  This is terrible.  It looks really good on camera when you say, let me see your peacock. 
[02:11:00]  Let me hear you say that.  No, no, no, no, no.  Where are you?  Damn.  You're not on the thing.  Where are you?  I'm going to come down there.  All right.  This is starting to slow me down.  It's a video.  No, no.  Stop doing whatever you're doing.  All right.  Hold on a second.  This is taking forever.  Wow.  Be more funny.  This is going great.  You can imagine how mad you guys would be if your sister called.  Okay, rugged.  Oh, that would be.  How come the room is going very fast?  It's amazing I know not to curse.  Yeah, man.  Quite amazing.  Brother, you know not to curse. 
[02:11:30]  And this show deserves everything it's getting.  That's horrendous.  The fake exasperation in his voice.  Oh, God.  I have to tell you, based on this chat room, I think I might know who is responsible, who  may be responsible for this attack.  Who?  One of the people in the chat room just wrote, Nicole Biggins from the morning mashup made  us do this.  Oh, no.  So I don't know if there's some kind of radio war going on.  Oh, I did this for you.  Wow. 
[02:12:00]  I'm Anthony Cooley.  I'm howling.  Oh.  Opio Radio on Twitter.  Nice.  Swastikas are coming in from Rick Voss.  Wait, our head is down.  What just happened?  Oh, there she goes.  They're mad.  Let's listen.  Yeah, I can't listen online anymore.  Why?  Any audio?  No.  No audio?  What happened?  I don't know.  Can't listen anymore online.  Well, there you go.  There's the, what is it called again?  The cane scan.  By the way, we went from like eight people in the room to 336. 
[02:12:30]  Did you hear how hopeful I was?  Like I was saying, man, this could be real.  Yeah.  You thought it was.  Because you were like, legally they could.  Yeah.  Of course it's not real.  Well, the phone's, I don't think the cane scam is.  Oh, it continues?  The cane scan's not done.  Come on.  The cane scan's not done.  What?  Yeah, no, they didn't finish.  I left with two bad knees and a dream to be in the radio chat room.  Yeah, no.  Hello?  Hello?  Listen.  Who is this?  Pardon me?  Sorry, what's the matter with you?  Who is this?  My name is Lars, and I go by Lars with my photography. 
[02:13:00]  I'm a photographer.  And right now, I have to be honest with you, your sister signed up for this.  She's a grown-up.  You're really slowing me down.  You can get all the...  I don't care if she's a grown-up or not.  I'm going to come down there.  Can you turn around that wine around?  That was really good.  The wine's right over there.  Bend up.  Can you do me a favor?  Can you bend over the bathtub like that?  Don't bend it.  Yeah, cool.  With the wine?  With the wine?  The camera.  No, no, no.  Don't do the wine.  Lars, put a...  It's the phone, Lars.  Oh, my gosh.  Where are you right now? 
[02:13:30]  Why?  Because I'm going to come down there and beat the shit out of you.  For doing what?  What did I do?  The photos of my baby sister are getting her drunk and taking advantage of her.  She's signed up for this herself.  She found me on Craigslist.  Do I work for you?  No.  You come down here.  You take your shirt off.  Tell you what.  I'm going to make you a deal.  I've never...  A brother-sister kissy thing.  I will give you guys five grand.  I will give you five grand.  Lars, shut your mouth.  Put my sister back on the phone now.  I will give you five grand.  Lars, put my sister on the phone and shut up. 
[02:14:00]  Five.  Put my sister on the phone.  I'll do it for six.  I've never shot.  It's for you.  We'll keep taking pictures.  Can you hold the wine glass and then at the same time?  Wow.  And shut up.  Hey, what's going on?  Tell me.  Dan, what's up?  What's going on?  What's going on?  I'm exhausted.  Yeah, we're in the same fucking business.  Why would they say the only person Greg Hughes hates more than you is Jim Shannon?  No, that's my pal.  That's one bridge I'm trying to rebuild. 
[02:14:30]  He doesn't respond to you on Twitter.  We started together as two young 18-year-olds.  Now fucking hates my guts because of Jack Tover.  You retweeted him and commented?  Yes, we rooped together.  We decided on our own to stay a summer in Geneseo to run the radio station together.  Now this guy hates me.  Breaking news from the chat room?  Yeah.  Eric Nagel eats shit by the spoonful. 
[02:15:00]  Dan, what's up?  Just calm down.  What's up?  Listen to me.  Shut up.  What color bra is that?  That's really inconsiderate.  You're my baby sister.  I'm working and at work.  You're my baby.  You're not at work.  You found some s**t on Craigslist to pay you money to get you s**t.  He was by far the most reputable person on Craigslist that I found.  Oh, damn it, Allie.  Damn it, you are making my bowels hurt right now.  Do you understand?  What does that mean?  Stop.  This is terrible.  You're taking naked pictures. 
[02:15:30]  They're going to be all over the internet.  Hey, I am being an independent woman and supporting myself.  No, you're getting drunk and this guy's taking advantage of you.  Please, I'll give you so much stuff.  He's not making me do anything that I'm not comfortable with.  Allie, Allie, Allie, here's what I need.  I have a good body.  I want to show it off.  You have a great body.  No.  But you look at other girls like that.  You don't have to look at these, but I'm sure other guys would like to.  Listen to me.  Please just tell me where you are.  I'll come down and pick you up.  Just stop doing this right now.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:16:00]  You're so cute.  You're going to sound so good on the Kane show.  I'm going to what?  Oh, dear.  We set you up with a Kane scam.  Your sister wrote us and wanted to know what the worst thing a sister could do to a brother is.  And we figured either be a stripper or do a topless photo shoot with a strange man on Craigslist.  Oh, I hate the radio.  Totally.  Kane scams are pre-taped and possibly edited for broadcast with permission granted from all participants. 
[02:16:30]  Why do they have to say that?  The lawyers have to fucking make them throw a disclaimer in.  The lawyers just made a bad bit worse.  It's entertainment.  Why do you have to say that?  Because it's stupid fucking lawyers.  They're kind of admitting that...  It's all, like, bullshit.  Wow.  What garbage.  Wow.  How are we done?  Nothing says comedy like a disclosure.  Yeah.  No kidding.  That really is hilarious.  How's the chat room doing? 
[02:17:00]  Oh, my God.  How do people want people to buy my new CD?  Oh, that's a good one.  Very kind.  Very kind words for my mother and her cooking.  I'm seeing some really, really nasty things going by.  This bitch looks like Herman Munster's cock or whatever it is.  Or whatever it is.  When you put a period after a bunch of letters, you can say whatever you want if there's a period  after each letter, people figure it out.  Well, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  People are doing it.  Jimmy Norton's a sweater boy cutie.  Yeah.  Well, that's too many to read now.  You rock just an oink, oink, fatty, fatty, fatty. 
[02:17:30]  They're pouring in.  Well, you guys want to do one more clip?  Yeah.  What do we got?  All right.  What's this?  We're featuring the Kane Show for today's Jacktober.  Oh, man.  They're doing a very, very original bit, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  I have not heard this one on radio before.  Right.  It's called War of...  There's a chew in my house.  War of the Roses.  War of the Roses.  No! 
[02:18:00]  As I told you.  No fucking way!  No way!  And this is going to be another fake radio bit.  War of the Roses.  The radio station gives away a dozen roses, and they call the guy and go,  Congratulations, you won a dozen roses.  Who do you want to give it to?  And the guy always says his mistress instead of his wife.  Or girlfriend.  Are you shitting me?  Someone wrote Nicole Biggins is an alcoholic.  It's true.  With this one, though, they switch it up a little bit. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  You can either do, you could pick that they'll do the flowers thing, or it could be, they'll  pretend to be a different radio show, and they'll ask your boyfriend, who was the last  person that saw you naked, intimately, and the both of you will win a trip.  And what the boyfriend doesn't know is the girlfriend is on the other line.  Oh!  And he mentions it in your life.  Wow.  So, I guess logically, if you're cheating, and a radio station calls you up, you give 
[02:19:00]  away that information, right?  Right, of course, yeah.  To your favorite radio show?  Especially to a made-up show.  All right, here's War of the Roses.  Probably, well, he might be on a break, because he works an overnight shift, so I don't know,  but you can call us, though.  Let's do the last person.  Let's do the last person to see you naked, to see if he, uh, because if he's had some 
[02:19:30]  nasty.  Hello?  Hey, Fred?  Hey.  Hey, I, this is Pete calling for Pete and Brenda in the morning.  I'm going to put you on the radio, is that okay?  I have somebody that's going to play a game that would like to, uh, to use your help in  winning a prize, a Caribbean cruise.  Can you hang on one second for me?  This will be live on the radio, is that all right?  Sure.  All right, how old was it?  See, it's different names. 
[02:20:00]  Good morning.  I just wanted to share with you that I was on the way to school with my eight-year-old  son.  Yeah.  And we're listening to this show, and he said, I like this show because they're not  acting, they're just being real.  Pete and Brenda in the morning.  That's us.  We're real.  Hey, Fred?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Hi, Fred.  Hey, buddy.  We have somebody on hold right now that has a chance to win a trip, and they need your 
[02:20:30]  help.  They gave us your phone number.  Okay.  Here's the thing, though, is the question I'm about to ask you is kind of a little bit  of an intimate question, but they insist you're going to say their name.  If I was to ask you, the last person that saw you intimately naked, what name would you  give me?  What first name?  And assuming they match up.  Oh, man.  Honey Boo Boo.  I don't know.  It's been a lot of people.  It's been a lot of people. 
[02:21:00]  This is the last person to see you naked, and unless you were performing as a Chippendales  dancer on the stage in front of hundreds of people.  Do you see what I'm saying?  This is an intimate thing.  This is a one-on-one thing.  Are you married?  Are you dating?  I'm seeing people, yeah.  You're seeing people?  Yeah.  Okay.  Ah.  All right.  Erica?  Erica is not the right answer.  Melinda.  Melinda is not the right answer.  Let's do this one more time here, and I'm going to help you out here. 
[02:21:30]  Is there anybody that you're seeing now that you would consider to be kind of...  How about you fucking keep the continuity, you cocksuckers?  It's all in October where I just walk away mad.  Is there anybody that you're seeing now that you would consider to be kind of closer in  your world?  Dana?  You're a dumbass.  Can we please just stop this? 
[02:22:00]  Uh-oh.  Fred?  Fred?  Tanya.  Tanya!  There we go!  Oh!  I know, do you?  What?  What?  All I know is somebody keeps saying Eric Nagel has jam breasts.  Yeah, there's conflicting reports, though, because he's also saying...  He's also saying Eric Nagel has jelly breasts.  And jam breasts. 
[02:22:30]  So they're arguing over the fact whether it's jelly or jam.  Whether Eric Nagel has jam or jelly breasts.  Why does the flowchart always go back to your...  You want part two of this dumb thing?  Yes, please.  Boy, did you notice his chick caught him?  Yes, chick caught him.  I gotta find out what happened, because he seems to be in Dutch now.  How do you want to know with me if you spotted all three different names?  That doesn't sound like Tanya.  He caught me off guard with a question.  What do you mean? 
[02:23:00]  What do you mean I caught you off guard with a question?  Fred, I was very clear.  I even set you up with, like, if I said your mom was on the other line, what would her first name be?  You knew what I was doing.  No, I just wasn't sure.  I didn't know what it meant.  What do you mean?  You weren't...  Who saw me, like people I work with or people I, you know...  He said intimately.  Yes.  How many times did he have to say that?  He said it at least two or three times.  What are you talking about?  Like social gatherings?  No. 
[02:23:30]  Fred, hold on.  Fred, my name is Kane, and the truth is there's no trip here, and Tanya wanted us to set you up.  Because she suspects there's something else going on here.  Specifically because of the blonde hair she found when you guys were getting intimate.  No, there's nothing else going on.  It's just...  I don't...  I don't...  Look, I...  Come on, Fred.  What's your answer, bud?  I mean, I must have just got caught on, like, one of my sweaters, and then got down there when I was... 
[02:24:00]  Oh, man, on your sweaters.  The other day, it was just gym shorts.  You see what I'm saying?  Who wears a sweater to the gym other than Bill Cosby?  How the hell would you feel if you had blonde hair down in my class?  He pulled it out with that.  Yes, he did.  I'd be understanding, and I'd listen to what you have to say.  Oh, that's...  Oh, please!  Fred!  A blonde hair found in his bed, but he sounds black.  Who are these other women that you're talking about?  I don't like the sound of this radio show.  You're not a loser.  You look like a loser.  I know.  I've got to.  Emily, no.  They're not... 
[02:24:30]  They're not...  I'm not dating them.  I'm not seeing them like that.  I'm going to take a line from Sarah and tell you this.  Hashtag unsubscribe, bitch.  Oh!  Here we go!  No!  Here we go!  Unsubscribe!  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  No.  Unsubscribe.  Unsubscribe, Fred!  Fred, you're unsubscribed.  Unsubscribe.  Nothing else you can say, sweetie.  He called me out of the blue.  I was under pressure. 
[02:25:00]  I don't know what to say.  He got me to the...  Under pressure!  Hashtag unsubscribe, be honest!  Unsubscribe!  Can we just talk about this at home?  No.  Unsubscribe.  One of the reasons is pre-taped and possibly edited for broadcast with permission granted  from all participants.  Those fucking lawyers.  Oh, God.  They stink.  I love that.  I love that disclaimer, man.  Why would you have to tell the listeners?  Why do you have to tell the listeners that?  Why would you ever have to tell... 
[02:25:30]  You know that some guy in his car going, I don't give a fuck.  Oh, Jesus.  That is so fucking...  Why would you have to tell your listeners that?  It's the best part of the scam.  But the lawyer would explain that.  That was the best part.  The disclaimer.  Hashtag unsubscribe.  Unsubscribe.  Can we start doing hashtags on the Opie and Anthony show, Sam Roberts, please?  That's pretty fucking cool right there.  Yeah, we can.  Because you're unsubscribing, what, from like him?  I guess so, man.  Oh, man.  I guess so.  That's great.  Unfollow.  But we loudly have to yell if somebody does one of our hashtags. 
[02:26:00]  Oh!  Well, the yelling is to kind of, you know, cover up the fact that the bit's going nowhere.  You think the bit went nowhere?  Yeah, and then you just get really loud and do, oh!  And it helps it along.  So, the woman is not necessarily unsubscribing from the man.  That's a lot of hashtag unsubscribes going through the chat room right now.  Oh, man.  Yep.  Oh, here she is.  Green card.  They are currently living here as productive members of society. 
[02:26:30]  Since both...  She's pretty hot, though.  I know that's not your type.  George W. Bush.  How are you different from George W. Bush?  The debate.  We should take a break, because we've got Rory coming in.  Oh, my Rory.  That's fucking great.  Rory Kennedy.  Our first Kennedy on the show.  Yes.  After all these years.  Yeah.  So, she's the daughter of what?  Robert.  Robert, right?  Robert Kennedy.  And Ethel?  Yeah, the book is called...  I've been trying to do the documentaries.  It's an HBO documentary about Ethel Kennedy. 
[02:27:00]  It was very, very interesting, because...  How's her teeth?  She looks good.  Rory's got good teeth.  Well, you know.  But Ethel Kennedy is like the last of the...  Of the...  Of JFK...  The old school.  Jackie.  Robert and her.  That foursome.  She's the last one living.  That's it.  How old is she?  80-something, but she looked amazing for...  And she was very coherent and very...  You know, she sounded like a woman 20 years younger when you watch her interview. 
[02:27:30]  Oh.  But it's all told from the perspective of the children.  Going to talk to Rory Kennedy next.  Thanks, Sam.  That was a terrific job.  Great one.  Good job.  That is a good one, by the way.  Good.  This is just...  The chat room is not going well for them.  No, it hasn't stopped.  It's only picked up steam.  Yeah.  How many people are there?  Just about 400.  Oh.  Up from eight.  800?  Wait, how is it down from...  No, eight.  They had eight people?  Oh.  Eight people.  Do we have 400 in there now? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  It's not bad.  We do some numbers.  Hilarious.  All right.  Terry Clifford tomorrow, Sam, hopefully?  I don't know.  Is it tomorrow or the day?  I don't know.  I hope so.  Depends.  Depends.  E-Rock is a jellier jam.  Shut the front door.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:28:30]  So the Kane Show, we just featured them on Jocktober.  They're big fans of ours, and they just posted something on their Facebook page.  What did they say?  They're very happy that they were finally featured on Jocktober.  Yes.  Apparently so.  What was the Facebook thing real fast?  Because we've got to get Rory Kennedy in here.  Oh, you don't have me right now?  Let me just tell you what it said.  Yeah.  It said, we're upset that it took this long to be featured on Jocktober. 
[02:29:00]  Remember, ONA, wish you were back on WJFK.  My man breasts are the same size as Jim Norton.  God, I hate it.  All right.  No, I don't hate it.  That's cool.  And I just found out, too.  They just announced, text the word HOLE to 36500 to win $1,000.  Too fucking funny.  So it's great for them.  That's all we want in the end is to be acknowledged, damn it.  Well, that sounds very nice.  So Rory Kennedy is outside the studio. 
[02:29:30]  This is our first Kennedy on the show, the daughter of Ethel and Robert Kennedy, promoting  the new documentary Ethel, which will be broadcast on HBO at 9 p.m. on October 18th.  Hi.  Good morning.  Take a seat.  Hello.  How are you?  Thank you.  Is this the hot seat?  Make yourself hungry.  That is the hot seat there, Rory.  It's easy here.  Very relaxed.  Yeah.  We try.  We actually clam up pretty well in front of ladies.  Oh, okay.  That's good to know.  I like that.  We get scared.  I saw your documentary last night. 
[02:30:00]  Thank you for watching it.  It was very good.  What made you want to do it?  Because it's called Ethel, and it's about, obviously, your mom.  Because I guess all the attention has been focused on your father, which is, I guess,  you know, when you're a Kennedy, it's always focused on the men.  But there's not much attention paid to your mom compared to your dad.  Yeah.  Well, that's part of why I wanted to tell it.  You know, my mother has raised us for the last 40 years and has been around, and I think  she's made a huge contribution. 
[02:30:30]  She's very kind of reticent to tell her own story, and she's never done an extensive interview  before or a book or anything.  So I felt like if we didn't do it now, her story probably wouldn't be told.  Was she hesitant to do it?  Because there was a couple of moments where it seemed like she didn't, like, it was hard  for her to talk about, obviously, when he was killed, and there were certain things that  she seemed to struggle with.  Yeah.  I think that it was, you know, it's not her comfort zone.  She does not like doing interviews.  She does not like talking about herself, and she doesn't like talking about the past. 
[02:31:00]  You know, she's somebody who really is in the present.  And so I think it was hard for her, but, you know, I'm glad she did it.  That's got to be tough for people in the Kennedys.  I mean, obviously, everybody wants to know about the past and hear stories about the past.  That's got to be a tough thing that would be in that environment if you're not very comfortable  with it.  Yeah, I think it is, actually.  I think that, really, all of my siblings and family kind of are very much future-thinking 
[02:31:30]  and in the present and doing amazing things with their lives, and I think that from the  outside, there's a lot of focus on kind of more of the tragedies in the past, and it's  not really where we're coming from, generally speaking.  You know what I noticed, too?  It's like we look at, like, whether it's the, you know, JFK assassination or Robert Kennedy,  it's like it's this piece of history for us.  It's like we're detachment.  It's just like a horrible piece of sad history.  Yeah, that's true. 
[02:32:00]  But you forget that there are, like, families around it, or I was amazed to realize that  I think that your parents were married for, what, 23 years or something?  Yeah, they got married when they were 20, 21 years old.  And you're like, oh, yeah, there was a whole life before he got into politics and there was  kids being had.  It wasn't just he was Robert Kennedy, the attorney general.  There was a whole lot of stuff happening.  Yeah, 11 kids.  Shoot.  Wow.  Thankfully, as I'm the 11th.  So I'm glad they had that many. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, you were the last one.  Yeah.  Do you ever feel weird because you never met your father?  I mean, it's very tough.  You came out.  I know it was six months after he died.  You were born.  And listening to all your brothers and sisters talk about the memories, do you ever feel like,  like, ah, I just, I'm frustrated that I missed any memories?  Well, it's sad, you know, to not, to not never have met him.  But I think that for all of us, it was a huge loss in our family.  And what was, one of the things that was nice about making this film is, as you know, it's, 
[02:33:00]  I just interviewed my siblings and my mother.  So it's really kind of a film from the inside out.  But because I'm the youngest and I have so many siblings, 10 older brothers and sisters,  my sister Kathleen, the eldest, is 18 years older than I am.  And so, you know, my older siblings had a very different experience than I did.  And they had, you know, it's just a different life.  And so it was nice to be able to sit down. 
[02:33:30]  You never really have that time in life, you know, to just ask all those questions about  what it was like.  And I got to do that with this film.  I found myself getting very angry watching it.  Just, you know, I mean, after JFK and then, and then, and then your dad is, you know, gets  the, you know, is ready to run for president.  And just knowing what was coming, I started getting really, really irritated that it was going  to happen again.  It's like, I mean, obviously we know what happens.  But I found myself getting very frustrated because most things that I've seen in the 
[02:34:00]  last X amount of years concentrate on John Kennedy, even more than Robert Kennedy.  And I found it very frustrating to watch.  Yeah.  Well, there's a, there's a lot of sadness there.  It was a pretty intense decade, the 1960s, you know, and a lot happened.  There was a lot of great things that came out of it, but a lot of tragedies too.  How do you probably get through something like that?  How did it, speaking with them to put together this documentary, how did they get through  that without wanting to just give up on, on everything, on, on faith in the world? 
[02:34:30]  Right.  Well, I think that's a big part of the film, frankly, is, you know, my mother in particular,  you know, to lose her husband and have 11 children and, um, in such a kind of tragic  manner and, uh, she served, she's a survivor and she's, uh, you know, I think she's just  has a, a, uh, great passion for life naturally.  And then I think her religious beliefs really buoyed her through the hard times. 
[02:35:00]  And I think probably also just having all the children, you know, and the kind of practical  day to day life and, and what you got to do to kind of get through that and changing diapers  and taking them back and forth to school.  You just, you know, you kind of go through the motions for a period of time.  Yeah.  That's kind of the point that Jimmy was bringing up about that really being real people in  a family, because it is just looked at as, as a historic event, uh, in our country, like,  like numerous other things that happen in this country. 
[02:35:30]  And unless you're part of the family, it's, it's kind of, uh, it's kind of weird when you  do put it in context that you are a family.  Well, I think the film tries to do that as well because it really interweaves these historical  moments that I think, you know, we all went through as a nation, the Cuban missile crisis,  the civil rights movement, um, the election of my uncle Jack and everything that, that  he fought for and believed in.  And, and, um, you know, I think had a major impact on, and then kind of looking behind 
[02:36:00]  the scenes of what was happening internally with our family during those events.  And, um, and I think in that way, I hope it speaks to people as, you know, cause it's  something that we all went through as a nation, even though some of us don't  remember it or didn't experience it firsthand.  It is our collective history.  Do you ever feel, uh, that, that name carries with it this expectation that is, is so hard 
[02:36:30]  to, to reach?  I mean, you're talking John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and, and, uh, Teddy.  It's just, it seems like it would be so hard to live up to that name.  Well, you know, I think that there were some really extraordinary people in that generation.  And, um, I feel like they've had an influence on me and, and who I am and the decisions I've  made in my life.  I think it's, um, you know, it's not something where I try to aspire to be who they were and 
[02:37:00]  accomplish what they did.  But, um, so to me, it's really a kind of positive influence in terms of, uh, just how I think  they have affected me.  And, you know, and I think, you know, obviously people are more aware of the contributions that  Jack has made and my father's made, Teddy's made.  But I think this film also brings to light the contributions that my mother made and sure 
[02:37:30]  and kind of having the women's perspective from my family, I think is important.  You know, Eunice Shriver was, had impacted so many people with the special Olympics.  Um, and I think those, you know, the women don't get as much attention, but yeah, yeah, they  deserve a place in history as well.  What, what are, what are some of the negatives of, of, uh, growing up with the, the Kennedy  name?  Are there things you have to deal with?  Well, I think that, you know, largely it's been enormously positive and created a lot of 
[02:38:00]  opportunities that otherwise wouldn't be there.  And, you know, I, I'm so grateful just to have my siblings be my siblings and, you know,  my parents are my parents and my family, extended family is just fantastic.  So I feel very lucky for that.  But I think sometimes, you know, there's, there are moments where you're kind of in the  public eye and scrutinized a little bit more than you would otherwise be.  And, um, and I, it hasn't played itself out with me so much, but I've seen it with other 
[02:38:30]  family members where, you know, it's, it's, there's unfairness or there's misrepresentations  in the media or where you just want to kind of scream and yell and try to change it.  And then that just pulls you into the frenzy a little bit more and prolongs the news cycle.  And so then you, you don't say anything, but it's frustrating to sit on the sidelines and  watch, you know, people be misrepresented in the press and you're kind of born into it.  It's nothing that you really can choose, which is kind of an odd thing that you're just born 
[02:39:00]  into this notoriety and, and, uh, the news wants to know about you and, and know what  you're doing.  And if you do trip up during life, it's, it's so much, it's scrutinized so much more than  just the ordinary Joe.  Yeah.  So I think that's, that's probably a challenge.  But as I say, there've been so many more opportunities and, you know, the positive is so much greater  than the negative that comes along with it.  Um, so I feel very grateful to have my life and have the opportunities that I've had. 
[02:39:30]  And how old is your mom?  If you don't mind me asking, cause she, she was extremely, like, you know, you think of  somebody who's, who lived through that era as a peer and she was, she looked amazingly  well for someone who's probably in her eighties, right?  Yeah.  She's 84.  Wow.  Yeah.  And as feisty as ever.  Yeah, she really was.  And she seemed like, you know, if she, if you told me she was 60 something, I would believe  it.  If not for the historical context.  There was a lot of great home footage too, which I liked a lot of things I'd never seen 
[02:40:00]  because you've seen so much of the, of the, even the private home movies, but there was  a lot of photos and like wedding videos and family vacation stuff with, uh, your brothers  and sisters and your mom and your father.  And it was really, uh, again, it just helps humanize these people that we see as kind of  historical figures.  Yeah.  It was, uh, that was one of the great things about making this film is going through all  of that archive.  And in my mother's house alone, there were 16,000 images that we went through. 
[02:40:30]  And, um, and then we were lucky to have.  Jimmy's computer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're probably a lot nicer than the ones I have.  But there were a lot of great home movies that I had never seen before and certainly  haven't been shared out in the world.  So it's nice to add that dimension.  Right.  Did your, um, uh, I forgot what I was going to ask.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, it was something about what I saw.  I said, I get completely blank thinking about your answer.  Oh, that's okay.  So what did, uh, besides raising a huge family like that, that's a lot, a lot of children. 
[02:41:00]  Um, what, what did your mom do from the time that, uh, that your, your dad died up until  pretty much now?  Yeah.  Well, I think one of the things the film documents is just how much, uh, uh, partnership they  had, my mother and father and how much of an influence she had on his life.  And, you know, that they really grew together during this very turbulent time in our, our  nation's history as the nation was growing, you saw them evolve as well. 
[02:41:30]  And I think after my father died, my mother continued on that trajectory of kind of social  activism and, um, social justice and she, uh, you know, has really dedicated her life  to, um, issues around human rights.  She's traveled extensively internationally, uh, and, you know, she's stood up to dictators  and, and made lots of demands, um, to treat people well and, and, and, and with decency. 
[02:42:00]  And I think that she's, um, you know, and then she's pursued other causes like Cesar Chavez.  She was a great friend with him and broke bread with him when he did his fast for the United  Farm Workers.  Um, so she's started the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Human Rights and Justice, which is, is  dedicated to, as, as the name suggests, human rights.  And, uh, they have a book award and a journalism award and a human rights award. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, wow.  She continued the legacy there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's, uh, the Hoover, by the way, is what I was thinking of when you said that about  stamps and dictators.  That's what I just lost was that, uh, you guys or your brothers and sisters used to go  to the gun range at the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover was not a fan of children.  He's a relatively awful guy.  Yeah.  My sister, Carrie tells a great story in the film about how my mother went to the FBI building  and, um, and, you know, Hoover didn't have a great relationship and my father didn't 
[02:43:00]  have a great relationship with him.  And, um, and my mother wasn't a particular fan either.  And as you say, he wasn't, he wasn't such a fan of my father or children.  And so anyway, they went to the FBI building and in the bottom of the FBI building, for some  reason, there was a suggestion box.  And so my mother had these, um, index cards that had her name on it, Ethel Kennedy, and she  took one out and took her red pen out.  And in the suggestion box, she wrote, get a new director. 
[02:43:30]  And it was back in the sixties to say that directly to J. Edgar Hoover.  And that note got right to J. Edgar Hoover's desk and then went right back to my father  within minutes.  Why did he not like your father?  I mean, it was the obvious, uh, you know, because I think, didn't he kind of cut off Hoover's  access to the president and he said, no, I'm your boss.  You're going to come to me.  But what, what was it that he really did not like about your dad?  You know, I think Hoover was a pretty invasive and intrusive man. 
[02:44:00]  And, you know, he was, he, um, liked to listen in on phone calls and, you know, he would really  sort of push the envelope in that way.  And I think that made my father very uncomfortable.  And, um, so I think there were conflicts over their politics.  Also Hoover had been there for decades, you know, at that point.  So he was kind of a, a staple.  And I think there was, he, he felt like he had a lot of power and a lot of control over  those years.  And, and so I think it was come in and want to turn the whole thing upside down. 
[02:44:30]  There was just some inherent conflict.  And then, you know, I don't think he was a particularly friendly man over the years.  How much have you entertained?  Cause there's been so much speculation and conspiracy with your family.  Do you just discount it all and not even give it any mind or, or growing up?  Did you entertain a lot of the conspiracy theories that go along with your family?  I haven't spent personally time, you know, exploring, exploring that. 
[02:45:00]  Um, so I can't, I can't really speak to it.  I, you know, I think that, um, I just wondered if you even gave it a thought or anything.  Yeah.  I mean, I think that there is, there, there is some evidence, but I, you know, I haven't  put a lot of thought into it myself and, and, um, you know, I think that, uh, obviously  it's the, the effect has been really, um, sad for all of us and, uh, kind of the loss  of my uncle Jack and, and, and my father and, you know, uh, Martin Luther King, you know, 
[02:45:30]  it's just a very turbulent, sad time.  Did you ever go to the ambassador?  You know, I've been there.  They've turned it into a school, um, with a lot of, uh, efforts from community activists  and, and my brother, Max and sister-in-law, Vicki played a big role in that because it, he  wanted to turn it into different, various things.  So it's now a terrific public school and, um, and I have been there. 
[02:46:00]  I was there for the opening and it's, it's fantastic that it's been able to turn into  something that was consistent with my father and mother's beliefs and really what they  dedicated their life to is helping people, um, who are underprivileged and, and need that  kind of support.  Yeah.  They were really genuine.  You know, a lot of politicians say it, but there was a story that, that comes out in the,  uh, in the documentary about how, where, where was your father?  He was in Mississippi and he came back, he just was in the middle of, you know, people  with bare feet who weren't eating and he, and he came back home and just kind of realized 
[02:46:30]  how, how good you have it and how good his family had it.  Yeah.  And I think that made a big impact and, you know, there's a lot more awareness now about  people living in poverty and, and, um, the hardship that they face.  But during that time, you know, there was very little awareness about what was happening  in the hills of Appalachia and, and the Mississippi Delta.  And, um, he went on that trip and was just shocked.  And he came back from that trip and, and really communicated that we needed to do something. 
[02:47:00]  And that was part of the reason why we started a school lunch program is because of what he  documented down during that, during that particular trip.  Is that who started a school lunch program?  I didn't know that.  Johnson did, but it was, it was initiated under Kennedy.  Wow.  It was just such a, a transitional period between when the government was kind of infallible,  not looked into, um, just business as usual. 
[02:47:30]  And then this great change came about with, um, with, uh, uh, Jack and, and your dad and  everything about, uh, how all of a sudden it was okay to question things and look into  things, say, Hey, this, this isn't quite right.  Let's change this.  And, uh, unfortunately it came with a lot of sacrifice like that.  Did, did, did you ever talk with your mom about, I don't want to say any good that comes  out of assassinations, but it did turn into, all right, look, enough's enough.  And I think especially with you, with your dad, it came to a point where people started 
[02:48:00]  saying, look, we got to do something about this.  Really enough is enough with, uh, uh, assassinations based on people's ideology on, on civil rights  and whatnot.  Yeah.  I don't think, um, you know, I, I don't think, I think it's hard to feel like any, you know,  anything particularly good.  Right.  Absolutely.  And the cost was so high, but, um, you know, I think that it, it's, uh, uh, important to  understand that decade and what was at stake for, especially, you know, I enjoy showing 
[02:48:30]  this film to younger people today because they see it and, and, you know, even though they  may have read about it, I think it's hard to understand what was at stake and, and really  what was happening and also what our politicians stood for and that you really could feel like  politics, politicians could make a difference and there could be leadership.  And, um, and so I think in that way, it opens people's eyes to that potential.  What do you think of when you see politicians these days when they're, they're talking about, 
[02:49:00]  um, changing things and, uh, when, when, you know, your father, especially there was real  change going on, uh, what do you think of today's politicians and the way things are  working in the, in the, or not working in the, well, you know, I campaigned for Obama and  I'm, I think he's had, uh, uh, tough go at it in terms of, um, kind of the conditions.  I think actually he shares a lot of values that my father and my uncle believed in.  Um, but I think the conditions have changed even when Teddy was around as Senator, you 
[02:49:30]  know, there was so much, um, collaboration and working with folks across the aisle and,  you know, he worked well with Senator Hatch.  They were very good friends, even though he was a, you know, a pretty, um, right, right  wing Republican.  And I think it's very hard now, especially when you have people, you know, I don't, I don't  mean to target the tea party, but I feel like there's real, uh, sense of kind of obstructionist 
[02:50:00]  and that it's very hard to get things done under those conditions.  Um, you know, when there are people who are signing documents saying I'll never raise taxes,  I'll never do this, that, or the other thing feels a little anti-democratic.  And, uh, and so I think it's hard within that context to accomplish the things that we were  able to do in the 1960s, you know, the civil rights legislation, war on poverty. 
[02:50:30]  These are things that both parties supported and got behind.  And, um, it's hard to imagine that happening today in such a way.  And so I think it's a pretty significant accomplishment that Obama was able to, uh, change health care  and, and, you know, provide access to so many people who otherwise wouldn't get it.  Um, I think he's, you know, the, the, obviously withdrawing coming out of Iraq is significant.  And, you know, I mean, I look back at four years ago when he came into office and three weeks 
[02:51:00]  into that, you know, the economy was plunging and there was a lot of fear and concern that  we were heading into a serious depression, you know, beyond a recession.  And you think back at those times and I feel like he's really kind of been able to write  the economy.  It's a, it's a long haul.  And I, I feel like the previous administration got us into this mess.  Oh, absolutely.  Trying to get out of it. 
[02:51:30]  So, you know, but it's hard, it's easy, I think, to kind of skew that into something else.  Or to blame him or feel like he's not doing everything he can.  And I, I really do feel like the conditions have changed.  So it's, it's harder.  Oh, I don't, I think the people are blind if they don't see that he's been trying and  he's sincere about it.  And, uh, we can only hope for, uh, yeah, four more years, uh, of Obama.  That's for sure.  I would hope for four more years of Obama and trying to really elect Congress people and  senators who, you know, and I'm not saying they all have to be Democrats and I, I think 
[02:52:00]  it's good to have both parties in there.  That would be nice though.  I'll tell you.  But I think that you gotta have, you know, people in there who are reasonable and who  are really looking at what is in the best interest of our country and not thinking, how can I damage  the president?  And, you know, and she's speaking your language, isn't it?  Oh, I know.  I've said this for four years now.  Almost four years.  Yeah.  Almost.  Yeah.  So, anyway, you got me started.  I hear you.  Are there any Republicans in your family? 
[02:52:30]  I'm sure there are.  I mean, or is it hard, like it's such a democratic or Democrat family.  It's like once in a while, there has to be someone that goes, I don't know.  I kind of like him.  Uh, no.  Oh, no?  It doesn't happen.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was the closest we can to that.  Um, no, there is nobody who is, uh, a blood relative on our side.  Actually, the, my mother's side, the Skikos, there are a lot of Republicans over there, but,  um, there are none that I love or none who have been outed. 
[02:53:00]  Right.  Uh, who are Kennedys.  When you were, how long did it take you when you were growing up to realize, um, A, that  you were part of a very different family and, and B, that there was a lot of grief there.  Like, what, what were some of the signs when you were really young?  Cause you didn't see it happen, that there was a lot of grief.  You know, I think there was, it was an evolution of becoming, um, increasingly aware as I got  older.  Uh, you know, I don't, there wasn't like an aha moment. 
[02:53:30]  And it was, you know, a kind of gradual awareness and a deepening of that understanding.  And what do you, are you, what do you, do you do films for work?  What do you do for work?  Yes, I make documentaries.  Oh, it is your thing.  Okay.  So this is what I've been doing.  Yeah, it was really good.  And, uh, you know, again, I've never seen Ethel Kennedy interviewed and it was very interesting  to hear her take on it and the campaigns and, um, you know, it was, it was really,  really, really well done.  With so many films done about, uh, the Kennedy family.  It's, uh, unique to, um, try to find a new angle on it. 
[02:54:00]  And yeah, the, the, the women behind some of these men, um, have really just been behind  a curtain for so many years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's nice, I think, to hear even just my mother's voice and she's, she, you know,  she's lived through so much and she's been on the front line of history, but she's also  a character and she's very funny and, you know, she's, she's got a lot of moxie and I think  that comes through in the film.  Is she still able to get pretty much anybody on the phone she wants?  She's pretty remarkable, um, in that respect. 
[02:54:30]  So, uh, and she'll, she'll ask anybody anything.  And so she's, she's, yes.  I saw a photo online of, uh, with, with, with president Clinton and it was, I forget what  was happening, but your family was there and it was Ethel Kennedy was just like leaning  over talking to somebody else while Bill's standing there smiling.  And it was so funny that she just was not impressed at all that she was standing with  Bill Clinton's.  Yeah.  I'm sure she thought it was terrific, but she had something else to say to somebody and  that was it.  She is a fan of Bill Clinton's. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was funny to see somebody.  Who isn't these days?  Jeez.  Everyone loves them.  Yeah, wasn't he great?  Everyone loves them.  Yes.  It was funny to see somebody just not impressed.  Somebody who's used to being in that, you know.  That orbit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I, I enjoyed it very much.  It's called, it's just called Ethel, right?  It's just called Ethel.  It's going to be on HBO tomorrow night, Thursday night at 9 p.m.  HBO's got great documentaries.  Amazing documentaries.  And, uh, we're, we're tracking it on Facebook and Twitter and keeping people updated because  we're also doing, continuing to do local screenings and getting it out there. 
[02:55:30]  Well, I loved it and I, parts of it made me very, very sad and, and also, like I said,  angry, um, and it was insightful and to hear all your brothers and sisters just talk about  Robert Kennedy's daddy and it was just a really very personal thing.  And I hope you laughed a little bit.  Yeah.  I mean, there was a couple of moments that I did, but I found more sad than, it made me  more angry.  Jimmy's a soft hearted boy.  It made me more angry for like, ah, God damn it.  Why did that happen?  You know, that's, that's the feeling because unfortunately you know the outcome. 
[02:56:00]  But I, I learned a lot about your, your mother that I didn't know and, and I never realized  how instrumental she was in, uh, and you know, being supportive of your dad, uh, running  and getting into the Senate here in New York and there's just a lot of stuff I don't think  she had more credit for.  Yeah.  So good.  Well, I'm glad you, you got something out of it.  I did.  I enjoyed it very much.  Great.  Thanks for, uh, thanks for coming by so much.  This has been a great, good talking to you all.  Thank you.  And we didn't curse once.  Well done by us.  I know, right?  First time ever in an interview. 
[02:56:30]  Be right back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I love TV.  I love watching my favorite shows every week, don't I?  You know what you also love?  What?  Obama.  You said it.  You said it.  I certainly did.  You love Obama.  I was blatantly lying to a Kennedy.  You know how hard it is to really say that?  I gotta be honest.  It's so hard to actually have those words even come out of my mouth. 
[02:57:00]  Can I add to that?  And you looked at me and gave me a dirty look like, don't you dare, don't you dare.  Because I just heard you chuckling.  You looked to your left and was like, please don't blow up my spot.  Ah, that's why I need a visual.  That was hilarious.  Yeah.  Yes, TV.  Lots of times I forget to record things sometimes.  And then I'm behind on what's going on in the later shows.  I hate that. 
[02:57:30]  But this is where Dish comes in.  They solved that problem.  Their whole home HD DVR, the hopper.  It's called Primetime Anytime.  And it lets me set my DVR.  Why do they have me in this, by the way?  We gotta change that.  Because everyone knows I.  Well, anyway.  It lets you set your DVR, your hopper.  It's called Primetime Anytime.  And you set that DVR, record all four major networks of Primetime TV, and you watch it later. 
[02:58:00]  You don't have to remember when your favorite shows are on or about recording them.  You just sit back, press the button, and Primetime TV is recorded and saved to your DVR for up to eight days.  Then you can watch anytime you want.  Problem solved.  If you don't want to miss your favorite shows again, get the hopper in Primetime Anytime.  Call Dish at 1-800-WATCH-TV.  Find out more.  That's 1-800-WATCH-TV.  Dish, let's watch TV.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel on Sirius XM. 
[02:58:30]  Murray Kennedy is coming in today.  That was great.  She has the eyes.  You can see it in the eyes.  The mouth, the whole look.  She got that Kennedy look.  She looks like R.F.J.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was funny. 
[02:59:00]  Well, you know, I couldn't just sit.  See, it was actually a problem.  Because as she's talking and saying all this stuff, I couldn't quite sit and look at her and go, yeah, yeah.  Knowing that, you know, it's against everything I really think.  So I just had to get in with a blatant lie and just support Obama.  You should challenge her a little bit.  She knows her fact.  I cannot argue politics with a Kennedy. 
[02:59:30]  Well, not with Robert.  With Robert Kennedy's daughter.  Yeah, of course that's how she feels.  I mean, obviously that's how she feels.  But she was pretty honest, though.  The father and mother lived, lived for the kind of policies that, you know, the father was all behind.  The civil rights thing and the social programs.  Fucking headphones.  Oh, man.  She's been working on them for five minutes.  I've been working with this.  I want big bread.  She was honest, though, because it was very insightful what she said about Obama.  Yeah.  How, you know, he means well and all that, but how the system is set up right now, you know, he's having a real tough time getting things done, unlike her uncle and father. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, the point that could have been brought across, which I didn't hear her mention one.  But she didn't go rah-rah, Obama's, you know, the greatest thing.  You could tell she's a little bummed out at how it's all been going down lately.  Well, she kind of blamed George W. Bush, and she kind of said that the Tea Party and the such is keeping the two sides from working together. 
[03:00:30]  But I didn't hear one Democratic roadblock that was thrown up that keeps the two from working together.  Yeah.  Which there are.  Our case daughter is biased.  Fair enough.  Absolutely, and I'm not even, that's why I wasn't even going to touch on that, because she should be.  She should be.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I liked her dad a lot.  I got no problem with her.  And I liked her mom after the interview.  I mean, it was, she's very fucking ballsy.  She was right.  She really, to send that note to Hoover, which is what I was.  That's funny.  That's great.  But that really was a fucking big deal. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To basically tell J. Edgar Hoover to go fuck himself in the FBI building.  You're fucking fruiting.  Yeah.  You know, from his boss's wife.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, John John was on the way to her wedding.  I wish I would have known that.  I didn't know that.  I didn't realize that.  I was.  Wow.  I was wondering if that wrecked her day or not.  Oh, man.  They had to reschedule the wedding.  See, I didn't realize any of that.  Yeah, he was on the way to Rory Kennedy's wedding when that plane went down. 
[03:01:30]  Jeepers creepers.  What year was that?  Was that 99?  99.  Yeah.  And they wound up getting married in Greece.  I guess they just.  13 years ago.  Wow.  Already.  Woo!  Yeah, my ex hated when Kennedy's died or Prince's died died.  Died, died?  Yeah.  She hated when that shit happened.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  I remember she would sit in front of the fucking TV watching every second of coverage.  And then the funerals, she would watch that and just cry her eyes out. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, he's just like, Jesus Christ, you won't stop fucking watching this shit.  Didn't we just go and drink or something?  Oh, yes, yes.  You enjoy the sadness.  We're going to go find a fucking beer.  Go enjoy the fucking morbid funerals on TV that you're going to watch.  Over and over again.  We're out of here.  She had all her Prince's Die books stacked up.  Oh, man.  It was easy to get her stuff for Christmas, though. 
[03:02:30]  Just get the latest Prince's Die book.  That was good.  Prince's Die calendar.  She was also a fan of dumb Lance Armstrong.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that fucking drug fiend.  Ah.  Anyway.  Can we go home?  Yeah, why don't we do that?  I guess the...  What happened?  What about that clip from today's...  Oh, yeah.  Kane's show was featured on Jocktober today.  And it turns out...  Ah, Kane seems cool.  Oh, boy.  That happens sometimes.  He wrote on his Facebook page that he was flattered that he was featured for Jocktober. 
[03:03:00]  And then they had a little dumb texting contest.  And they turned it around a little bit and did this.  The 24-hour treat life of Taylor Swift.  Think you can handle it?  All right.  Let's go.  Here's the word.  You ready?  Text the word HOLE right now.  H-O-L-E.  Text HOLE to 36500.  Okay.  Text HOLE to 36500.  We're talking about $1,000 that you can totally use.  Whether it be to take the Zumba classes with our friend in Maine. 
[03:03:30]  Or perhaps handbags and shoes could be yours.  Text HOLE H-O-L-E to 36500.  Hold the 36500 right now.  Ticket scams.  Hello?  See, he doesn't...  Wow, geez.  Ticket scams.  Hello?  Ticket scams.  That's funny.  He doesn't disagree with us whatsoever.  And you hear her.  She's trying to let go of it and have fun.  But she's like, okay.  I don't know if I liked it.  You guys are calling me a ho.  Oh, boy.  That was funny that he went with it, though. 
[03:04:00]  Good for you, Kane.  Yeah.  The Kane show down there in Washington, D.C.  I'll give it to him.  I mean, it's funny.  But I don't know if I necessarily like the direction it's going in.  It's not the most inclusive comedy.  Get your jingles in, people.  You want to hear a couple more jingles that came in?  Yes.  Only if they're nice.  Before we wrap up for today, we got our jingle contest.  Thanks to Steven Singer.  I hate stevensinger.com.  $2,000 up for grabs.  Jingle.  Hopefully we'll get some more prizes for the runner-ups.  We'll see.  But they're starting to come in.  And here's the next contestant. 
[03:04:30]  This is Fred Adderhold, it looks like.  Adderhold?  I guess.  What does that even mean?  How about putting it down?  You totally nailed him.  Good.  Minnesope, Minnes Anthony, and Jimmy Norton.  Back to back.  Betty to Betty.  It's not a jingle.  That's not really a yingle thing. 
[03:05:00]  It kind of works, though.  At least it's like a little stinger.  That's fun.  It's a stinger.  It's a stinger.  It's a stinger.  It's a stinger.  A stinger, yes.  Single no.  Lee Perryman, he's got an entry in the contest.  Just an old-fashioned radio show.  Everyone knows Opie and Anthony.  He's doing the horrible singing.  Just an old-fashioned radio show.  Show.  And that little tranny lovin' Jimmy. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, joy.  Hope he likes to stomp on homeless people's cakes when they're left down low.  And Anthony is swungin' his gun around when he's not fucking 17 years old.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't forget little Jimmy or how we miss him when he's gone.  You're like the yellow discipline from black hookers with strap-ons on. 
[03:06:00]  Strap-ons on?  And that's the end of it?  It just ends.  It just ends.  What the fuck?  It just ends.  It was funny, but terrible.  Right.  But funny.  But terrible.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got a couple more we could squeeze in before we get out of here.  It's our jingle contest.  Get your entries in.  What's the email again?  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And all that info is on our Facebook page.  $2,000.  Thanks to IHateStevenSinger.com.  Here's Stephen Kilroy. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We're together in perfect harmony.  Side by side on my radio dial with little Jimmy.  It's not a jingle. 
[03:07:00]  Wasn't it great?  You didn't like it?  I don't like the concept.  I don't like that together in perfect.  It's like you can't use the same line from the real song.  We all got to learn from Todd.  Yeah.  Todd knows how to do a fucking song.  Todd should enter this contest.  Get a couple grand for himself.  That's right.  Matt Poss, listening, something like that.  This is his entry.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony. 
[03:07:30]  Let me show you how much.  I enjoyed that.  That's just weird.  We get a lot of potheads, don't we?  I love Opie and Anthony.  And the final one, The Adventures of Crime Fighter Jimmy, episode one, The Beef Heartbreaker.  This is Zach Whitlock.  It doesn't sound like it's going to be a jingle, by the way. 
[03:08:00]  No.  Now people are just taking advantage of our contest to get their creative shit in, which  we don't mind, by the way.  Jimmy Norton browses the streets of the meatpacking district, looking for a little lady named Danger.  Danger shivers, pushes my window to your wily legs until Norton trips to see the same trend  go to rough road, Brad.  She ranks him with a tug in the town as he spots a distress call coming from a speeding bus. 
[03:08:30]  He pushes her down a flight of stairs.  Sorry, honey, but mom just went off and broke out his skivvies.  Somebody's got to clean it up.  That was good.  That was really bad, though.  Really?  I think that the listeners should not try to do their imitations of ant voices.  Yeah, thanks.  Well, we're learning.  We're learning as we go along here.  The jingle contest is on. 
[03:09:00]  I'll have more tomorrow.  Game on.  Game on.  I'll have more tomorrow.  More came in?  Yeah, we've already gotten some more.  Oh, good.  All right.  Once again, what's the email?  ObiAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  $2,000.  A little fame.  There is $2,000 wide open on the table right now.  I don't know.  There's a couple of good ones.  Yeah, but they weren't jingles.  It's so fucking weird.  Jimmy, anything?  Because we're going home.  Yes.  Important. 
[03:09:30]  This coming Friday, I'm at the Sunset Station Hotel in Vegas, Club Madrid.  Henderson, right outside Vegas.  And Thursday through Sunday now at the Helium in Philly, we've added a Sunday show as well  as a late show Thursday.  The entire weekend is sold out, so if you want to come see me at my first comedy club appearance  in Philly, do so.  Toronto, November 9th at the Dark Comedy Festival, Randolph Academy.  And then November 15, 16, 17, Dallas, the Addison Improv. 
[03:10:00]  And grab no baby for you, pre-sales on iTunes now.  And make sure your jingles are really jingly.  Jingles?  Well, yeah.  Jingle.  A jingle should be happy.  I like the radio.  Yes, indeed I do.  I like Opie and Anthony.  How about you?  Pew!  Your lasers suck.  That's terrible.  That's a good one. 
[03:10:30]  All right, y'all.  Yeah.  All right.  Later.  The Opie and Anthony show is available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand. 
[03:11:00]  After Opie and Anthony, life is coming up next!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah </pre>
