<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing a sense of déjà vu about their routine and the all-consuming nature of their work. This quickly transitioned into a discussion of Jimmy's unusual fascination with Koran recitations on YouTube, prompting debate on the memorization skill involved.  They then complained about SiriusXM's marketing, specifically the show's lack of representation at CES. The conversation bounced between Opie's new GoPro cameras, a negative sitcom review, Fios TV issues, problems accessing sporting events, a brief mention of I-Rob, and a lengthy segment dissecting a Newt Gingrich anti-Mitt Romney political ad.  This ad analysis was punctuated by banter about its discovery and playful ribbing of E-Rock.  The segment concluded with discussions about Hulk Hogan's mustache, Johnny Cash's early career, the song "Don't Take Your Guns to Town," and predictions for the Broncos vs. Patriots game.

The show then shifted to reminiscing about their time in Boston, mentioning restaurants like Ruby Tuesdays and Legal Seafood.  The conversation moved to Tim Tebow and a poll suggesting divine intervention in his football success, prompting skeptical and profane commentary from the hosts and in-studio guest, Dr. Gay.  Several Tim Tebow parody songs, including a Jimmy Fallon version, were played and criticized.  The discussion veered to missing Opie and Anthony promotional posters at a SiriusXM event, leading to accusations against a colleague, Gary.  They discussed declining eyesight, a listener call about bad driving, a listener's tweet mocking Michael Moore, further poster complaints, and workplace gossip.  A video from a self-described hater, filled with profanity and insults comparing the hosts to vultures and Jesse Ventura, was played. The segment concluded with a candy preference debate.

A significant portion of the show focused on another video from a show critic. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaged in a highly offensive and vulgar tirade against the creator, using derogatory terms and making exaggerated claims about his incompetence and hygiene. They speculated about his supposed support for Ron Paul and indulged in increasingly graphic fantasies, including a fictional account of near-dog abuse.  The hosts mocked his physical condition (later revealed to be wheelchair use) and personal life.  Jonathan, a host's manager, joined, participating in a trivia game about world flags which he won.  The segment also briefly mentioned Patrice O'Neal's upcoming CD and a run-in with Terrence Howard involving a malfunctioning camera flash.  The segment concluded with renewed insults toward the video creator.

Jonathan then recounted his recent travels, detailing unsettling experiences in Africa: barbecued diseased goat, hotel rats, encounters with armed individuals, questionable sanitation, and corrupt border officials. He described his bribery methods and his wife's dislike of his travel stories, which frequently featured fictional characters "Chip" and "Bill Tetley."  A large portion focused on Patrice O'Neal's album "Mr. P," its emotional impact, and its reception during Jonathan's African travels. The conversation included tangents about bot flies, tsetse flies, a doctor's unusual examination of Jonathan's wife, his first Moscow trip in 1986, a friend broadcasting American TV to Iran, and airport security comparisons.  The segment ended with plugs for Patrice O'Neal and Jim Norton, and mentions of Sam Roberts, Von, Who Kid, and Terrence Howard.

The final segment started with a discussion about racial dynamics in friendships, specifically Jay-Z's potential friendships.  This led to a sexually explicit conversation about Jonathan's genitalia, followed by discussions of various celebrities' physical attributes, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z's baby, often using crude language. Who Kid's video mocking Jay-Z's baby was a major focus. A female guest shared her dating experiences.  Musical guest Von DeCarlo discussed her new music video in explicit terms.  The segment included tangents about travel, celebrities, and personal anecdotes. It concluded with plugs for Von DeCarlo, Patrice, Who Kid, Ron and Fez, and a future segment on hoarders.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning!  God, I had a dream we were just here doing this.  Oh, wait. Why don't we just say good morning?  Yeah.  Hey, good morning!  Yep.  Oh, God. Mars came in, he talked about his asshole, and it just seems like yesterday.  Oh, wait a minute.  We just did that, right?  We just did that!  No, we did that yesterday.  I swear we just did it.  Wow! 
[00:00:30]  Wow, amazing.  Wow, this is becoming a job.  It's just becoming something that's just like, I feel like I absolutely was just here.  Yeah.  It's all-consuming.  It's so weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I go home and don't think, oh, okay, I'm done.  I could go about my business.  Like, it's always there.  Like, ah, I gotta get up and, you know, go back in there very early.  So it just kind of dictates what you do for the rest of the day.  And then that evening, and sleep, and fucking, ah, it's crazy. 
[00:01:00]  But we're here, and it's Friday.  Yeah, at least it's Friday, Friday.  Friday, Friday.  Friday, Friday, Friday.  Woo!  Friday, Friday.  Everybody, everybody.  I'm dancing.  Go on right to the weekend.  And we go on Friday.  Friday, Friday.  Fuck off and die day.  Everybody must be on your way.  You know what I've been listening to a lot of?  Weekend.  Weekend.  Party and party and party and party and party and party and party and party.  Yes, Jimmy?  Koran recitings. 
[00:01:30]  Koran recitings.  I can't stop.  What's wrong with you?  They're great.  Why are they great?  I just go online and look for Koran.  What is going on with you?  You really are doing anything to keep off a porn.  Who would do that?  It's like, ah, Koran.  Why?  I saw it.  Jerking off to it.  A documentary called, I forget, Koran something.  It's about.  Koran, Koran.  It's like hungry like a wild.  A land or something.  Koran.  Yeah.  And they're about.  It's about these people. 
[00:02:00]  There's a contest in Cairo every year to memorize the Koran completely.  Sounds like a hoot.  And it's.  Well, they go.  They have these.  They read in front of this group.  Like they'll sit in front of a computer screen in front of all these like clerics.  And they hit a button on the thing and a voice reads a passage.  And then they have to just pick up from there.  Whoa.  Wherever it is in the book.  And they have to do it in the proper voice.  It's not going to speak a word, obviously.  That's crazy.  But all those times you see those videos like. 
[00:02:30]  That's all just Koran readings.  I didn't know.  I thought it was like.  It's like who's singing these songs?  Koran by heart.  Yeah, that's what it is.  And they have like 10 year old kids that memorize the whole.  Yeah, sure.  Good girl.  Memorize it.  Uncle Mohammed.  But I've been watching.  I went on YouTube and I've been watching Koran.  And they're fun.  I think you're having a nervous breakdown.  No.  No, no.  You've run out of things to look at on the internet.  You're having a nervous breakdown.  You just don't know it yet. 
[00:03:00]  No.  No one should be doing that.  They are really.  They're good.  When you watch a Koran.  Yeah, it's like a weird music.  You're not going to find it there, I don't think.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Where do we go?  Oh, I don't know.  They just go to Koran.  All right, let's go back to Friday.  Go to beautiful Koran.  But it's just weird when you find yourself getting caught up on YouTube.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure you didn't start looking for that either.  You just kind of.  Well, on this one I did.  You kind of found it. 
[00:03:30]  I wanted to see what it was like to watch a bunch of different people feed the Koran.  I don't know what's happening to me.  Just zip through there.  When you see the guy stand in front of a microphone, it's good.  Can we take your temperature?  I don't think you're feeling all right.  No, I don't feel ill.  You sure?  Yeah.  They all just look like they're up to something.  Yeah.  Which one it is.  Yeah, they look like they're up to something.  Instantly recall all of that.  Oh, he's just talking about it. 
[00:04:00]  They're judged by the accuracy of the recitation, but also by the way it's actually done.  There's all these very complex rules.  This is like toddlers in turbans.  They have to.  Tajweed, yeah.  It's the inflection.  Boom!  So the reciters learn these very finite rules.  Oh.  And then the melody.  I watched this for an hour the other day.  It has to be completely improvised.  Be more funny! 
[00:04:30]  This is absolutely awful.  This is going great!  This is incredibly complex.  Yeah, we might not, uh...  This might not be the place to play them.  That's good.  It's like morning prayer.  Boring!  I've been really enjoying this.  I care!  I care!  I care!  I care!  And all of that comes together.  Oh, Beretta.  Oh.  All right.  We should probably stop this before we get ourselves shot. 
[00:05:00]  Before we get ourselves shot.  You know what I mean?  You can't.  They really don't like this.  I've been really...  You can't make fun of that stuff.  I've really been enjoying this.  I can't believe E-Rock was playing all those clips.  Yeah.  Terrible.  I can't either.  I mean, he was paying attention.  But I had a...  I've had kind of a new, uh...  Oh, my God.  He's going Muslim.  Yeah.  He's going Muslim on us.  No, but I did like...  Oh, boy.  ...very much the Muslims in that documentary. 
[00:05:30]  They were great.  Yeah, they were nice.  Well, any time you could get a documentary where they're not lopping off heads or strapping  dynamite to themselves, it is kind of sweet.  No, I'm not getting that radical.  I just...  I'm just not as...  Oh, boy.  I'm just not as crazy as I...  Dude!  What the fuck, man?  Now Jimmy's a Muslim!  No.  I'm not.  You know how the calls and Twitter...  I'm starting to look like one, and Jimmy's acting like one.  Well, that's true.  What the hell's going on with this show?  No, Opie's more...  You've got more of a Sikh look to you.  A Sikh?  A Sikh.  I'm trying...  I'm going to, like, start... 
[00:06:00]  What do they do?  They roll it up?  No, it's the Jews, the Curly Q's.  Greg, Opie, sing.  No, the...  Oh, the beer game.  The cabbies, man.  They roll it up.  Oh, yeah.  Right now, Opie's eating...  He's eating dates.  What else is he supposed to do with them?  Yeah, sure.  It's a very Middle Eastern thing.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  But the documentary was very good.  Bad date.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it is Friday, though.  To watch these 10-year-olds.  You know what's very interesting, too?  What?  How the company takes care of us, and I just want to thank them. 
[00:06:30]  For what?  For not including us in CES.  Oh, right.  Yeah, I heard about that.  What do you mean?  Well, they're over there at CES, I guess.  No, they got their...  Consumer Electronics Show out there in Las Vegas.  They got their Sirius XM booth.  So they got a little booth there, and apparently somebody, a fan of the show, saw it.  Somebody?  Oh.  We have so many fucking spies out there now.  And nary a mention of the Opie and Anthony channel or show. 
[00:07:00]  Are they mentioning the other shows?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, the premiere show on the platform.  Yeah.  And they'd rather mention the part-timer before they even give us a mention.  Well, what are you going to do?  We don't belong here.  Well, again, it's the marketing department.  It stinks.  Well, yeah.  Well, I'll start with the secretaries of the channel.  Of defense?  And then move from there.  Oh.  That's different.  We used to be like stars out there at CES. 
[00:07:30]  Big stars.  Now we're not even mentioned.  I remember that.  They set up a stage for us.  We used to do a show.  We used to be stars.  Oh.  Went out there three or four times.  And then after that, we were still represented.  Our images.  Yo, represent.  I hear you.  Is there any talent out there at all?  No, I'm sure they've kind of, what, they've kind of scaled back.  Yeah, I guess that would be the way to say it.  Scaled back.  They don't spend as much money as they used to, but still. 
[00:08:00]  It's like a radio on a podium on the floor.  Yeah.  But no mentioning?  No signs?  No.  No.  Nothing that's representative of this program, even being part of a series.  See, and then they do these little things where, you know, somebody will walk into a  store and see a display with our name on it.  Yeah.  And take a picture and go, hey, wow, look, the company did something.  And that's supposed to make us go, oh, cool.  Yeah.  But it's got to be consistent, you know? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Well, I mean, people get mad because we bitch or I bitch a lot, but some of the bitching  gets things done.  Bitching.  You know, I think all the bitching we did got us on that dumb commercial.  Yeah.  And I mean dumb in a good way.  It's a cool commercial where all the logos are flying at you.  Whoa, look out.  Here we come.  And you know what?  Because we were such pins in the asses and bitching all the time.  I'm convinced.  Don't say that in front of Mars.  I'm convinced that's what got us on that commercial.  Yeah.  So.  But then, like you said, it's not consistent. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And then we're left off of something else that we should absolutely be on.  We should be on everything.  I everything.  We've been here seven years.  We should be on everything.  And that's how you develop other talent coming up if you want to consider us coming up.  You can't just assume, like, these big names that don't even do radio shows for you are  going to be around forever.  You should develop the fucking farm team.  That's why I would never rely on their PR department for anything.  They won't do it.  They just won't do it.  They suck. 
[00:09:30]  It's not a mistake and it's not an oversight.  They're not stupid people.  They just know.  They're not interested in promoting this show.  No.  They're just not interested in doing it.  Yeah, it's too bad.  It really is too bad.  And they never will be.  It's a shame.  It's a big time shame.  How's that Pop-Tart?  Good?  Fucking Pop-Tarty.  Yeah.  A strawberry Pop-Tart in the morning?  Yee-haw. 
[00:10:00]  You guys watch I-Rob last night?  No.  You didn't watch?  Mm-mm.  I DVR it.  The DVR just rejects it.  Won't let it record.  Yeah.  The quality is not up to par.  Hey, by the way, before you get into that.  I was going to have to get into that.  I'll stop it.  It's just a typical sitcom.  Oh, okay.  With so much laugh tracks going on, you don't even know what's funny anymore. 
[00:10:30]  Well.  So that's it.  Well, I had a problem with Fios because they changed their guide.  Have you noticed that, Jim?  I have, yes.  This one is much crisper.  Yes.  But the font is very small.  It's a lot smaller.  What they've done is they fit in more of the time frame.  So what used to show you maybe three hours, I guess, of programming, now you get like five  hours of programming before you've got to scroll down the screen. 
[00:11:00]  And then there's, it used to be so easy to just go and look at your HD channels.  Right.  But now you've got to click over to the right and then a half a menu comes out.  I'm not very hip on that whole thing.  But they did put the feature in where you can now easily access all of your DVRs from  your entire house, no matter where you are.  So if I'm down in the living room and I want to access something I DVR'd up in the bedroom, 
[00:11:30]  there it is.  I can do it.  Boom.  What's the button?  Boom.  That would be your menu and then DVR.  And it says unnamed DVR and then you can name them and each one is a different DVR in  your house.  Fucking righteous.  That was righteous, but I really wasn't appreciating the new guide.  That seems like a no brainer for a cable company.  Yeah.  Because how frustrating is it when you do record a programming, a program on TV.  You never, in front of the TV with the DVR, you want to.  I want to go to bed early, maybe watch some TV and maybe watch, in my case, NHL 24-7. 
[00:12:00]  Oh.  Now.  And I'm like, fuck, I taped down the living room.  Fuck.  Yeah.  And then I see what I got taped in the bedroom and it's mostly girly shows.  And I'm like, fuck.  Damn.  It's girly shows.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, we've got the housewives.  Oh, I thought you meant like porno.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, I'm a...  No, I'm a child of the Lord.  I don't look at porno these days.  It always seems to be, though, that whatever TV you're in front of, it's not the one that 
[00:12:30]  DVR'd the thing you want to watch.  Exactly.  It's a cointos.  Do you get to watch hockey?  I don't watch the hockey.  Yeah, I don't get to watch hockey anymore or the Knicks.  Oh, because of your MSG and Time Warner Cable?  Yeah.  But you think the cable company would come to me and say, wow, this is a real big inconvenience,  so we're going to knock some money off your bill?  Oh, please.  No.  You got to fucking chase them and maybe they'll do something.  Maybe.  We can't watch the Knicks in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Yeah, Time Warner is pretty much all over Manhattan. 
[00:13:00]  Or hockey, because MSG had a lot of the games.  They pretty much had the Islanders, the Devils, and the Rangers.  That covers everyone in the area.  Can't watch any of those games.  No.  You're done.  Holy fuck.  When are they going to work that out?  I don't know.  This one doesn't even...  I haven't even heard any news about them talking.  You know, when this usually happens, you'll hear, well, they're in talks and hopefully  they'll hammer something out.  This one, I've heard no news on whatsoever.  Yeah.  So, hey, good luck.  Look, I got Fios, so I don't even care. 
[00:13:30]  I guess the Islanders lost last night.  People still think I'm a big fan.  I'm not really a fan these days.  Yeah.  But the Flyers beat them, I guess, so...  Oh, pity.  Everyone was tweeting me.  I'm like, look, I can't even fucking watch the game.  I can't watch it.  Yeah.  I'm not going to spend more money just to watch hockey now.  I spent enough money on cable.  I wasn't...  I did a lot of nothing yesterday.  Yeah.  After the show.  It was a shitty rainy day.  Yeah.  A little sleep, a little, you know, a little workout. 
[00:14:00]  And then it was just like kind of busy work and watching bad television and stuff.  I showed you.  I got two of those Hero 2 cameras because I want one for me and then one for the girl  when we go on the cruise.  I call them GoPros.  Why are you saying Hero?  Because it's called the Hero 2.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I just know it as the GoPros, which are great cameras.  Hero 2 is the newer version.  It's got...  You go up to like, what is it, 120 frames per second. 
[00:14:30]  Jeez.  So you could do this ultra slow-mo, which looks really cool.  Right.  And then I realized, okay, I got two of them.  And when you have two of these, you can get that case where you can then video in 3D.  It's just a case where that fits both of the cameras next to each other.  And then they have proprietary software where you can then pump out a 3D HD broadcast.  I mean, a video.  That's fucked up.  Which, so, in the near future, let me announce right now on this very program. 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  No.  3D podcast.  Yeah, but...  3D compound podcast.  Yeah, but...  Yes, sir?  You spent a fucking shitload on your cameras, and now you're going to replace them with these  GoPros?  Not all the time.  It's a special event.  It'll be a special event of nothing but things coming at the camera.  It's called HD Hero 2, but it's made by GoPros.  Yeah, GoPro.  The company, I guess.  GoPro makes it.  Just so people know, they're like the sports cameras.  When people are snowboarding and shit, they put it on their helmets or motocross. 
[00:15:30]  They put it on their bikes.  Looks great.  Glasses?  They've got to come up with their own little glasses.  What the fuck am I?  You know, CES...  They're easy to find, 3D glasses.  They're all over now.  Speaking of 3D glasses, I was reading an article about CES.  Yeah.  And they're saying that 3D TVs are a massive bust because no one wants to fucking put on  their stupid glasses.  Put the glasses on.  I've heard from people that are too heavy to watch a two-hour movie.  They, like, hurt your nose.  Yeah.  They're having a real problem with the 3D thing right now.  Because of that.  And nobody wants to swap out their TVs.  We just switched technology. 
[00:16:00]  People are always willing to swap out their TVs for something better.  Yes.  They said people are...  Shut up, Sam.  I'm not going to you.  Sorry, Sam.  You know, I'm thinking of doing maybe 3D podcasting for the compound.  Sorry we can't all do what celebrities did that were good.  Let me think...  Oh, oh, oh.  Let me think when I had a 22-inch TV.  I had a 22-inch TV when I was working in Buffalo.  A 22?  Making $12,000 a year.  And then they pumped me up to $14,000 a year.  That's when I had my 22-inch. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  So you're way the fuck behind.  I wouldn't say way.  Exactly.  Way the fuck behind.  Yeah.  I like that GoPro HD Hero.  Oh, it's cool as fuck.  Well, I'm going on a cruise, so I want both of us to have it so that when we go in the  water and shit, because they come in these waterproof cases, and they're really cool.  They could take kind of a beating.  There's also what they call a picatinny.  I hate the sound of that. 
[00:17:00]  Picatinny mount.  It's a rail on a gun, and they mount your optics on there and stuff.  They got one of those for this, where you could mount that on the front of your AR-15.  Sure.  Go shooting and get that front kind of eye view of what you're shooting at.  Nice.  Pretty cool.  Very good.  Or face it backwards and look at your dumb face as you're shooting.  Or do both and do split screen.  Well, that's what you should do when you shoot that .50 cal, because you tell people it gives  you the flu for a few seconds.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I would love to see a video of your face after you shot that.  I bet it would shake the shit out of the camera. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, I'll try it, though.  Yeah, but you might be able to slow it down and get some stills out of it.  Oh, man.  Slow-mo.  Maybe see the fucking bullet.  Wah!  Right.  Can you put a 3D thing above the target and then shoot it without shooting the camera?  Whoa, and then look at the bullet coming at you.  I think it's probably going a little too fast for that.  Yeah, this is not a movie, Sam.  You're not going to get the actual bullet.  Little Matrix-y, right?  When are we going to be able to get the jackass cameras?  When are those going to be affordable? 
[00:18:00]  Which ones?  Well, you saw a jackass where it's super slow-mo.  Oh, those are the high-speed cams.  They go for a fuckload.  That's what I'm thinking.  Those are film, and you're only really getting a few seconds of the actual.  Right, but eventually we'll be able to afford that, right?  Shot.  They're on film, they're still shooting?  Yeah, the high-speed is film, and it goes like...  You just hear the film flying at massive frames per second.  What's the advantage to that?  Well, it's taking a separate picture so close together in time that when you play it back, 
[00:18:30]  you're getting every single second.  You ever see those raindrops hitting the water, and you see the water come up,  and it's very, very slow and graceful looking?  Yeah, that's a high-speed camera.  They run the film through the camera so fast that every frame you're catching what you would normally catch on a regular video camera.  It's what, 30 frames per second?  Man, these things go up into the thousands of frames per second.  Oh, my God.  And you're catching so much detail on it. 
[00:19:00]  It's insane.  It looks goofy.  And that's it?  That's the 3D one.  You hear the...  The other thing they're selling at CES is TVs with a lot more pixels.  Yeah.  I think they're saying 10 times more pixels.  Really?  Can you imagine what that looks like?  Good shit right there, right?  And they're not stopping there.  They're going to go even crazier than that.  Man.  I would have loved to have gone to CES.  Wow, man.  I'm not a huge tech guy, but I used to love going to CES and just checking out what's coming out.  I like technology.  I know.  You're a big fan. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, it's great.  Wait, what's the...  Oh, I think the Porn Awards was last week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They always do these timeless things together.  Oh, they're smart.  Yeah.  It's all men.  Yeah.  The men look at tits and technology.  It's perfect for Vegas.  I'll tell you what, the men don't look out there.  The logo for this program.  Right.  That they will not...  Terrible job.  They won't be distracted by that garbage, you know.  It's really just...  That's going to annoy me all day.  Of course it will.  Oh, that's why I brought it up.  Of course it will. 
[00:20:00]  All day.  I really...  I really have decided to try not to bitch as much, but they make it so easy.  We still look...  We're still looking at these dumb yellow lights.  They have just decided...  You know what?  We're used to...  Eventually, they'll stop bitching about it.  And we did.  We don't need to fix it.  And we did.  One of the yellow filters is even missing off that one.  They don't even notice.  Oh, look at that.  Update on the lights?  Yeah.  Is...  You got an update on the lights?  I do.  On the lights?  I do.  I was asked if I know anybody from Fox or anything who does lighting, like an actual 
[00:20:30]  TV studio guy that could come in and look at it.  Yeah.  Do I have any preference?  And I actually recommended...  I said maybe possibly stunt-braining people over there at the Blaze, because you said that  it was a good setup.  Yeah, I liked that.  So maybe one of those guys could come in and see the type of lighting that he recommends.  Oh.  You know, it's a suggestion.  Now that I'm in the Glenn Beck camp, because I did GBTV once, according to everybody on  Twitter, I'm a Glenn Beck guy now.  Oh. 
[00:21:00]  Join the club, right?  It's exhausting to try to keep up with these idiots.  Oh, please.  But they do have a really nice setup over there.  Yeah.  I don't agree with him politically, you idiots.  I don't know many people that do.  Right.  He's way the fuck out there.  They had me on because of my Occupy Wall Street videos, which is not so political, how I shot  that shit.  I don't know what's wrong with you promoting your fascism on the Glenn Beck show.  Exactly.  What's wrong with that?  Yes.  Speaking of politics, you see the new Mitt Romney commercial that Newt Gingrich put out? 
[00:21:30]  I told Anthony, Newt Gingrich is your worst enemy.  Quite the bashing he's giving.  Because we all know Anthony's a little bit into the Republican Party.  And Newt Gingrich just put out a commercial.  You would swear it's Obama getting ready for the election.  But no, it's one of Mitt's own guys, you know, technically, because they're all Republicans.  Just bashing the shit out of him.  This looks like a late October ad where they're just now just beating the crap at each other. 
[00:22:00]  Democrat against Republican.  But no, it's a Gingrich ad.  And then the Gingrich would gladly be his VP.  That's why they're all so...  You think?  With Gingrich, I'm not so sure.  They're all such frauds.  They attack each other in the primaries.  And man, as soon as one gets the denomination...  No, I know.  But Gingrich seems a little different than past years.  I'm not so sure.  Well, Hillary was bashing Obama.  Yeah.  And then she takes the gig as, you know, Secretary of State.  She said she'd vote for McCain before Obama at one point in the primaries.  Apparently not.  And she's like, totally bashed his lack of experience. 
[00:22:30]  Do you think Romney would take Gingrich?  I don't know if Romney would take Gingrich, but I think if he...  Would Gingrich say yes to that?  Theoretically, if he did, I don't know.  He might.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Because you know that you still have a tremendous amount of power as the VP.  And if he dies or something happens to the president...  Yeah.  I'm telling you, you guys are sleeping on fuck...  Well, you're not opiate.  You know.  Oh, yeah.  I was watching Ron Paul clips yesterday.  I'm not a radical nut, but I'm telling you,  even the clips I didn't agree with.  And there are some.  His views on abortion stink. 
[00:23:00]  His views on a lot of things, I think, stink.  What about his view about Iran and the nukes?  He doesn't mind so much if they have a nukes.  I disagree with him on that.  But I disagree with him.  You're never going to find a guy you totally agree with.  True.  So you find the one that you agree with more than the others.  Yes.  And I like him more than the others.  Oh.  And even when I don't agree with him,  I at least believe his explanation.  Yeah.  Even if I don't like it, I believe it.  With the other...  I don't think he says phony politician things.  No.  He kind of shoots from the hip.  And he gives you his opinion on things. 
[00:23:30]  And he gives real answers, even if I don't like him.  And I love that.  Yeah.  So I really, really like that guy.  It does seem to be.  But I don't think America's going to be doing that.  Cambridge has no shot at winning.  He's too disliked.  And also...  It's Mitts.  It's either Mitt Romney.  It's not even either.  Or Romney's going to get the nomination.  Romney's going to get the nomination.  It's pretty much over.  Romney's absolutely getting the nomination.  Especially after South Carolina.  It's really over.  It really is.  You want to hear this commercial, though? 
[00:24:00]  By Newt?  That better be the right one.  Oh, boy.  It doesn't look like the right one.  Why would it be?  Sam?  Oh, boy.  It doesn't look like the right one.  You're fine.  Are you willing to take a chance and push play on that?  Are you willing?  Are you willing to?  Are you willing to push that?  It's the front page of HuffPost, and it says...  All right.  Fair enough.  Are you willing to push play?  You think that's the one?  Is this the one?  Do you have confidence enough to push play?  Sure.  Turn your key, sir.  You sure?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not going to put anything...  Are you sure? 
[00:24:30]  What's up?  What's the bet?  What am I gambling?  I already took you out on the bet.  I know.  I took your TV out.  The last time you bet, darling, you didn't do very well.  I wouldn't be betting if I were you.  Just asking if you're willing to push play on that.  Yeah, I'm willing to push play.  Confident?  Yeah.  I'm always confident.  All right.  Let's push play.  You're confident.  That's your final answer.  How old is that?  That was the last time he hosted that, Anthony.  Jesus.  Douchebag.  Go ahead.  Push play.  Ah, say it's wrong.  Ah, an ad.  Say it's wrong.  It's for Google. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, it's an ad already.  It's for Google Chrome.  Google Chrome is a bust.  Oh, boy.  The family.  Say yes.  When you had the 60-second or the 30-second ad?  Oh, brother.  Are you involved in your Google Plus page?  Oh, your circles?  Oh, it stinks.  I am on Google Plus's OP radio, but I only go there once in a while.  I never look.  For now.  Someone's included you in it.  What?  I like the concept of Google Plus.  I don't know what it means.  They got it kind of scaled down a little bit, but I kind of like it. 
[00:25:30]  Different circles and this one.  What does that mean?  Circles.  I don't know.  I don't know what it means.  Well, I mean, you could send something just to your friends.  Send something just to your comic friends.  I could ignore any circle now.  Yeah, I could just send something to people I know or just say it on the...  I like it.  I don't think it's going to take off.  Right.  I think they've got to really scale back and kind of refocus, but I like the concept.  Capitalism made America great. 
[00:26:00]  Free markets.  Is this the commercial, Sam?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I mean, that's it.  Oh, man.  I think that's it.  Oh, man.  That's it.  You're the one who asked for it.  I've never seen it.  Oh, man.  I think that's it.  That sounds like a political ad.  Yeah, this is the...  No, look, Ant's shaking his head, too.  I don't think this is it.  Every news channel is playing the new one.  The new one.  The newest of the new one.  That features the clips of the old candidates.  That's right.  John Kerry.  In the caucus and comparing Mitt Romney to those candidates and his leaning Democrat. 
[00:26:30]  Not about his shenanigans with that fucking company he was with there.  Right.  That seems to be what that's about.  You think that might be it down there?  Oh, why don't you click that one?  We'll watch an ad again and then we'll...  Let's do it.  King of Bane.  King of Bane.  Because Bane, the company he was with and...  I thought that was a deaf guy singing a police song.  Ning of Bane! 
[00:27:00]  Sorry.  That's so hack.  Oh, Chrome again.  Oh, no.  Do you love or hate the little kid at the end of that commercial?  Love him.  Which one?  Where he's riding the bicycle and he's all excited.  You've never seen this stupid video?  I don't even deal.  No.  What?  This commercial?  I don't know where we are now.  Sam's clicked on something else now.  It's right there.  It's the same thing.  You sure?  Yes.  Okay.  That's a black lady. 
[00:27:30]  Oh.  That's who it is.  Yeah.  Oh, that kid?  That girl?  I'm just babbling.  All right.  60 plus.  Let's roll now.  One way.  Chapter one.  You can do anything.  Can you?  That kid.  The rock and roll kid?  The rock and roll kid.  The rock and roll kid rules. 
[00:28:00]  It's adorable.  Google Chrome.  A group of corporate raiders.  Oh, boy.  This isn't it either.  Oh, no.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  Sam.  Sam.  What are you doing?  I can't believe it.  What are you doing?  Sam.  It's horrible.  Everyone is playing the new one.  He didn't Google it right.  Google new Newt Gingrich attachment new.  Right.  Did you go to Huffington Post or Gingrich?  I was just on Huffington Post.  That's the one I clicked.  Did you try Drudge? 
[00:28:30]  Go to new.  You have to put new in Google.  Right.  You just search by Tom.  Oh, that might be it.  Huh?  Oh, hey, wait a minute.  I think you got it.  Where?  Down there.  Where?  Where?  There it is.  Yeah, that.  But now, how do we see it big?  Why is it labeled Eric Nagel?  He just sent it to me.  Oh, see?  See, Eric had to do your job.  You threw him a fucking life jacket.  Finally, some competence around here.  E-Rock's a piece of shit.  Oh, wow.  Why would you let him off the hook?  We're in the middle of doing a little bit there.  For old time's sake.  Yeah, why would you do that?  That was a little bit, and then you let him off the hook. 
[00:29:00]  And you know Sam will beat the shit out of you any chance he gets.  I will do that.  You're a cuckold.  You really are, man.  He's a good friend.  E-Rock, that is a very valid question.  You like watching black cock go into vaginas.  Oh, you like that?  Prepping the ball.  Yeah.  Do you prep the ball?  He likes that while his tongue flicks the clit, knowing that the shaft will bump it.  His accidental homosexuality.  Let's ask E-Rock.  Why would you let Sam off the hook?  It wasn't like the show was suffering.  We weren't floundering.  Sam was uncomfortable. 
[00:29:30]  He was sort of sweating a little bit, even though he's not going to admit that.  And then you give him the link.  It wasn't letting him off the hook.  It was, look, get over talking to Sam and move on to the ad itself.  Oh, I guess he's producing the show.  We should be talking about how long a segment should go.  Really?  All right, E-Rock.  You thought we were going a little long there, didn't you?  That's good.  Oh, just wanted to get past Sam and move on.  Oh, okay.  Just move on.  What should we do now, E-Rock?  Ouch.  Play the ad that Sam couldn't find.  And then what? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, man.  He's trying with everything he can to turn it back against me.  Oh, man.  And you guys started attacking him.  Yeah, he blew it.  He did.  Just let Sam fucking flounder.  Yeah.  It's great when that happens.  He's a little jealous of Sam.  Here's what it was.  It's not about that.  He wanted to be the hero.  The hero, right.  Thanks, E-Rock.  He wanted to hear.  Thank you.  E-Rock, you do know Sam would never let you off the hook, right?  Yeah.  So, fuck.  You had him.  Hey, did you hear about Sam?  He couldn't find the video.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, that's not it.  E-Rock wanted to be, he wanted to be like, I'm the guy who did it and Sam couldn't.  He wanted to be the competent guy.  But you can't save me and then when they grill you on it, try to turn it back against me.  It doesn't work anymore.  See?  See, he's beating you up right now.  You don't even know.  Just go with it.  You saved him and now he's kicking your ass.  He gratefully saved you?  Yeah.  I mean, it was nice of him, but he could at least go with it, you know, when they start  grilling.  Sam was a little uncomfortable there.  Yeah.  A little bit.  And E-Rock and his Amon Gert hairdo, Russian.  He saved me. 
[00:31:00]  Hey, E-Rock, is Hulk Hogan still one of your heroes?  No, he hasn't been in a while.  He's not in your top five?  No, not in a while.  Do you have a new top five?  No.  I'm sure he does.  Who is?  Tell us.  What's it at the Renna Center commercials?  I don't like anybody anymore.  Anybody.  No one likes you either.  Look, you have to make.  That was blunt, but all right.  You have to make a new top five hero list for the next break.  Please.  Oh, that's good idea.  One of your ex-heroes, Hulk Hogan, is going to shave his mustache, and that's a massive 
[00:31:30]  story today.  You know, someone did it first online.  Me.  You think Hulk is stealing it from you?  Hulk is stealing it from me.  Holy shit.  The Hulkster.  Wow.  You think he's going to try to keep it in one piece?  Yeah.  Like put it, glue it to paper and then sell it to pay off his wife?  Really?  I have to sell my mustache, brother.  He could just grow individual mustaches for his fans?  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Here's the Mitt Romney ad.  This is it, right?  This is from Newt Gingrich.  Thanks to E-Rock.  Yes.  This is the new ad that just came out.  All praise E-Rock.  That's pretty brutal, man.  You would expect this from, you know, the Democrats.  Yeah.  But it's kind of one of your own guys that obviously has to drop out of the race sooner  than later.  Uh-huh.  But he decides, I'm going to punch my way out.  He's doing some damage on the way out.  Oh, boy.  He's like a big-headed baby.  What has Massachusetts given us? 
[00:32:30]  A liberal governor who wanted us to believe he is strong on defense.  That's the caucus.  A liberal senator who wanted us to believe he was the man of the people.  And a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan.  Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush.  I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.  Romney donated to Democrats, and given the choice to vote in the Democrat or Republican  primary, Romney chose the Democrats, voting for a liberal Democrat instead of President  George H.W. Bush.  Romney opposed the contract with America, raised taxes, and authored government-mandated 
[00:33:00]  health care with taxpayer-funded abortions.  Wow.  But now, he tells us, trust me, I'm a conservative.  Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney, he'll say anything to win.  Anything.  And just like John Kerry, he speaks French, too.  Bonjour.  Je m'appelle Mitt Romney.  But he's still a Massachusetts moderate, and a Massachusetts moderate cannot beat Barack  Obama. 
[00:33:30]  Paid for by Newt 2012.  Fucking Newt.  Can you believe the fucking damage he's trying to put on this motherfucker?  I love Newt Gingrich.  I don't know his policy.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But just his attitude and his personality, I love the fucking guy.  He don't give a shit.  He just seems like a fat, privileged twat to me.  That's why I don't like him.  He probably is.  He just annoys me.  He seems like everything that you've been looking at for the last 50 years.  I think he's another one of those people that have been in Washington for so many years  that they feel that they're owed the shot at the presidency. 
[00:34:00]  It's just their turn, and he's getting kind of dissed that he had the lead at one point.  It probably felt pretty good.  Like, all right, I'm going to cruise into the nomination.  And then Mitt pulls ahead.  So now he's just trying to take everyone down with him with ads like this.  Like we were saying, that's an ad that would air in October, right before the election,  by the Democrats.  Yes.  That's a move-on organization ad right there. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  This is a jealous, fat baby.  It's great.  I love it.  He does look like a big baby.  He does.  He's a big, fat child.  With Captain Kangaroo hair.  Oh, he stinks.  Yeah.  All right.  I just don't like him.  Didn't he go away for a long time?  He was gone for a long time.  What are you doing?  Stay or gone?  Then he came out of stay gone.  He was gone at least 10 years, right?  Or you be gone.  Oh, shit.  I'd say 10 years, yeah.  Oh, shit.  I just don't want to look at him anymore. 
[00:35:00]  Enough.  With that fucking dumb face of his.  What was he, Speaker of the House at one point?  Yeah, he was one of those things.  And was he Speaker of the House?  Yes.  He was indeed.  In what years?  When Bush Sr.?  He was a ping in the ass to Clinton.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, late 90s.  Yeah, he was in there during the...  He was a ping in the ass to the good old Bill.  And what ruined him finally?  Was it one of his many...  Didn't he cheat on his wives or something?  Did that bring him down? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, he had some indiscretions with some ladies, you know.  We may have taken advantage with a few ladies, but...  Who the fuck would fuck him?  There's power there, you know.  He's a powerful guy.  And who knows if he's...  Jesus.  You know, who knows if they were lookers.  They could have been real pigs.  Just one...  Maybe it was fucking Tip O'Neill.  Just one pig fucking another pig.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember that...  Mute.  Whatever happened to that extremely ugly broad that was involved with the Monica Lewinsky skin? 
[00:36:00]  Linda Tripp.  Linda Tripp.  Oh, Linda Tripp.  Wow, is she a fucking...  Oh, wow.  Man.  Wow.  History just plows those people asunder.  And remember they tried to dolly her up and it just didn't work?  Yep.  Look at this.  There was her.  Look at this fucking thing.  They tried to gussy her up.  And then there was the other pig that fucked Bill with the big nose and then she got like  the nose job and shit.  Was that Paula or...  Yeah, I think it was, right?  Paula Jones? 
[00:36:30]  Paula Jones, right.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right.  Yeah, women were coming out of the woodwork with Clinton.  He played a big fat Arkansas dick.  That's it.  Oh, her.  And then she got the nose job and didn't look too bad.  And she posed in Playboy, right, or something, or Penthouse, or Swank, or fucking Wii, or  Black Inches, Honcho.  I had explained to somebody the other day, I was talking about Black Inches and Honcho,  and of course they were looking during the story like, just waiting to say like, what 
[00:37:00]  were you doing looking at those magazines?  And I had explained that during the walkover back in the day when we used to have to walk  from K-Rock to XM...  We used to enjoy Black Inches.  Yeah, we would stop at the magazine kiosk, and Jimmy would purchase a copy of some gay  porno and just start right there at the kiosk, just start showing the guy behind the counter  the pictures and saying, isn't it nice, right?  Nice.  Oh, good, really good, really good.  Which went against that guy's religion.  Which made it even better.  They would all laugh, though. 
[00:37:30]  Of course.  It was like funny.  Of course.  Very good, Jimmy.  Those were fun days.  Look, our food's here, it's warm, so why don't we break?  Oh, I like the thought of that right now.  We got a lot of football games this weekend.  Maybe we'll do a little football.  We're definitely going to do some Tim Tebow songs today.  Oh, God.  Not song, songs.  There's some songs now that people are putting out.  Jimmy Fallon, I think it was last night, hit one out of the fucking park.  Yeah.  He's got a really good Tim Tebow song.  We're going to play that for everybody. 
[00:38:00]  Also, John Parr's got a Tim Tebow song.  John Parr, the guy that sang St. Elmo's Fire.  Right.  Many, many, many, many years ago.  Yeah, I thought it was a parody, but it's actually John Parr.  It's actually him doing it.  He has nothing else to do, so he figured, I'll do a Tim Tebow song.  What a guy.  And then we got a few others that are...  Oh, good.  I like that.  The worse they are, the better.  Yeah.  One's called The Lady Cake Boys.  One's called Super Fans.  And one's called Tebow time.  If you remember, look...  We're fans of the parody song. 
[00:38:30]  Bad song parodies, if you recall, are what brought the funny back after 9-11.  Yes.  We were just...  Everybody, we didn't know how to bring anything funny back to the show, because it was so tragic.  And then there were these horrid songs, and they weren't even parodies.  They were like tribute songs that were so horrid, so bad.  With the rhyming and all that.  Yeah.  We would play the game, yeah.  Where we'd play half a verse, and then try to figure out what line he used next, what rhymed  with how he ham-handedly threw in Taliban, Towers Fell, Freedom, Freedom, yeah, Liberty. 
[00:39:00]  Freedom Ring.  Oh, Liberty was our big one.  Oh, God.  It was awful.  All right.  So we're going to do some Tebow songs.  Yeah.  We'll do that after the break.  Good clean fun.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I hear the train a-coming, it's rolling around a bend, and I ain't seen the sunshine since 
[00:39:30]  I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps dragging on.  But that train keeps a-rolling, on down the side and on.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, sexy. 
[00:40:00]  I shot a man in Reno, I guess.  Just to watch him die.  When I hear that whistle blowing.  Ah.  B-Rock wants some pie.  Oh, sorry.  Shoehorning.  I know.  I want shoehorning.  I like it.  B-Rock.  It's not E-Rock.  Why the Johnny Cash today?  We all know, but why?  Well, 44 years ago today, he played at Folsom Prison.  Oh.  That was the famous Folsom Prison. 
[00:40:30]  I was watching Johnny Cash clips recently on...  Was he singing the Koran?  Yeah.  That would be odd.  Yeah, it was really bizarre.  Allah Akbar.  He didn't know what he was saying.  No.  From the 50s.  Like, he was a big star before the Beatles by a few years.  Oh, yeah.  Six years?  Five years?  Yeah.  That's what he had in America.  He was the bad boy.  Yeah, he was from some wholesome guy who had a TV show. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, I love this young man.  You know, I'm going to play some songs for you.  You like that type of an introduction?  Yeah, yeah.  I forget the name of the show.  We like to bring on a young gentleman now that...  All right.  Why do you talk so funny?  It's weird to see Johnny Cash when he was 23 fucking years old, but he was a big, handsome  son of a bitch.  Let's see the video now, man.  Just put Johnny Cash 23.  I'm sure he's putting the wrong thing.  Johnny Cakes, The Sopranos comes up.  Gets all sexy.  I think that's it, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Fucking young he is.  He's 23 there?  I believe he is, yeah.  He looks older, right?  I think that's it.  That hair is great.  It's so slicked.  Look at the oil in that hair.  Yeah.  It's one of those guys that always kind of looked old.  Yeah.  I keep a close watch on this hard...  And the guy looks like Tom Papa standing behind him.  Oh, my God, that's funny! 
[00:42:00]  No auto-tune back then.  Fuck, no.  He's singing.  And then they go...  I find it very, very easy...  I fucking love Johnny Cash.  He's just...  Melodic.  Yep.  Melodic.  Mongrel class of singer.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[00:42:30]  Always be a good boy.  Never play with a gun.  And I shut him...  You hear that song,  Don't Take Your Guns to Town?  Yeah.  Don't take your guns to town, son.  Leave your guns at home, Bill.  Oh, that's great.  The fucking kid takes his gun to town and catches one?  A young boy named Billy Joe...  Billy Joe.  ...wrestless on the farm.  Yeah.  A boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harm.  Oh, no.  He changed his clothes and shined his boots...  You know what it was? 
[00:43:00]  He came of age.  Yeah.  But his mother knew.  Yes.  His mother cried as he walked out.  Don't take your guns to town, son.  Leave your guns at home, Bill.  Don't take your guns to town.  Right here, you just know it's not going to end well for Bill.  Well, Billy Joe has become a man, and he tells mother.  Yes, he tells mother.  And he laughs it off.  But then when he's sitting in the bar, he has his first drink.  Oh, he had his first drink?  And a dusty cowpoke. 
[00:43:30]  He begins to laugh him down.  Oh, you can't laugh him down.  Well, the thing is great that, like, you just know that when you're drinking and a dusty  cowpoke is there, he's going to be a complete douche.  Yeah.  Don't take your guns to town, son.  Leave your guns at home, Bill.  Don't take your guns to town.  Whoa, Bill.  Poor Bill.  Yeah.  He sang a song his own.  He rode his guns, hung at his hip. 
[00:44:00]  Nice.  He rode into a cattle town, a smile up on his lips.  Not listening to mother.  He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down.  But his mother's words echoed again.  Echoed.  Oh, he's shoehorning.  Don't take your guns to town, son.  Leave your guns at home, Bill.  A real mama's boy keeps hearing his mother talk to him.  Don't take your guns.  I know.  Then again, mother was giving some good advice.  Leave the guns here.  She probably knew Bill was a hair-trigger douche. 
[00:44:30]  She made a little prick.  Strong liquor then to calm his shaking hands.  Angry drunk.  And tried to tell himself at last he had to become a man.  Yep.  Booze and guns.  That's what makes you a man.  A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down.  Oh, shit.  He heard again his mother's words.  I want to know why the cowpoke was laughing at him.  Because he's probably...  He's like this kid, right?  He's obviously a kid.  He's got his guns.  He's got his whiskey.  He does his shot.  He probably made a face. 
[00:45:00]  And the dusty cowpoke probably went like...  Get him some milk.  You know.  Bill was raised when Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw.  Uh-oh.  But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw.  Oh, shit.  That sucked.  As Billy Joe fell to the floor, the crowd all gathered round  And wondered at his final words.  Don't take your guns.  Oh, this is what he's saying now. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, boy.  Leave your guns at home, Bill.  You know, if you've got time to say your mom's words,  you've got time to point that gun at the dusty cowpoke  and maybe take him out.  Well, he was laying on the ground and shot.  Yeah, but he's singing a fucking song.  How about you muster up your energy and fucking shoot that bastard?  He was probably in death throes.  Yeah?  The dusty cowpoke probably left.  He just shot a guy.  Not that fast, right?  And he's just laying there, bleeding, going,  don't take...  Like, just remembering...  Don't take your gun.  I doubt he was singing it.  No, the people heard it. 
[00:46:00]  They didn't understand why he was saying those words.  He had his final words.  Not he didn't sing it, though.  His final words, right.  Well, he said it.  He should have taken his mama's advice.  But he had enough energy to say something.  He could have fucking shot that bastard.  But it might have been very quietly.  Sometimes people think and speak in their death,  but they don't try to pull out a gun and aim it.  What do you think?  The cowpoke would have stood there?  Billy Joe couldn't shoot him when he was standing next to him.  Billy Joe sucked.  He's an incompetent twat.  What was Billy Joe going to do?  He had two guns with little flags come out with bang written on it.  Yeah, he fucking couldn't do well with a shot of whiskey in one hand 
[00:46:30]  and his hand on his gun.  Terrible.  All right.  Tim Tebow.  He's going to get his ass kicked tomorrow.  And I like Tebow, but...  You can't even guarantee that.  The Broncos, Patriots?  Even Bill Barr.  Get the fuck out of here.  I was listening to the Bill Barr podcast, which is very entertaining.  Yeah.  And he was even saying, like, he goes, I don't know.  I don't know what's going to happen.  You can't...  You can't count them out?  This isn't a given for the Pats. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  Pats at home?  Yeah.  He said he doesn't know.  They can play in the cold.  Denver can play in the cold.  I would...  You know.  But he's saying Tebow isn't fucking anything.  I would love to see Tebow beat the Patriots.  That would be amazing.  This guy's on a level.  It would be an amazing story, but it's not happening.  Yeah.  He said he's on a level where it's like he's not that good or wasn't that good.  So when he does something good, it's like, wow, this guy's the best.  And it's like, no.  Because, you know, give me a few opportunities. 
[00:47:30]  I'll hit the mark.  He goes, are you going to sign me?  Right.  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Everyone's going to be watching, though.  The way Tebow and the Broncos...  People are watching Tebow more than any other TV show at this point.  But the way it's gone on with the Broncos all season, you can't count them out of anything.  I know.  You're right.  It's so fucked up.  I guess you're right, but...  Yeah.  But on paper, you're like, there's no way Brady's going to allow Tebow to go up there  and beat him.  There's no way.  We'll have to see.  Tomorrow night at 8 o'clock, that game's on. 
[00:48:00]  Where are we going to be tomorrow night at 8 o'clock?  At the Jim Norton Show.  Yes.  At the Brigada in Atlantic City.  We're all packing our bags as we speak.  I can't fucking wait.  I'm looking forward to it, too.  Getting down there real life.  It's going to be fun, man.  Yeah.  It's a fun hang.  All right.  So who you got?  Broncos or Patriots, eh?  I'm going to go...  For shits and giggles, let's call it.  Denver.  Yeah.  I'm going to take the Broncos and Jesus. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  I got to go Tim Tebow.  So I don't think he has a shot.  You don't think he's got a shot, but you're going to take him anyway.  Yeah, because it's a good story.  And then I'll look like a fucking superhero if he wins.  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  People are kind of expecting it.  Like I said, that's the way this movie ends, is with him actually going the whole way and  winning the Super Bowl.  No, that ain't happening.  You don't think that's going to happen?  Not a chance, but...  Not a chance. 
[00:49:00]  Whoa.  Here's the deal.  Not a chance.  The Broncos lose in New England, even though I'm taking Tebow.  So I got both sides covered here.  And then everyone looks at the Broncos and say, wow, what an amazing season they had.  That's it.  That's it.  There's no disappointments here.  They had an amazing run.  But it's over this weekend, even though I'm taking Tebow.  You're saying it's over.  Yes.  See your hearts with the Pats.  Me?  Yeah.  I enjoyed my Boston roots.  Yeah.  My three, what, years up there? 
[00:49:30]  Three wonderful years in Ashland for me, so I could really fucking take it or leave  it.  That was a little closer, but not much.  Why don't we go to Natick?  Let's go to the Ruby Tuesdays at Natick and get some Grameyay.  On Route 9.  Let's go get some lobster.  Route 9 had some good joints.  Oh, of course it did.  We saw them all.  Yeah.  In our day.  Did you enjoy the Ruby Tuesdays?  No.  Hated being anywhere with them.  What was the seafood joint we used to all go to? 
[00:50:00]  Legal Seafood.  It was Legal Seafood.  That's great.  We went to Legal Seafood.  I used to love Legal Seafood.  Fucking rules, man.  I used to love it.  Yeah.  Then there was that Irish joint that opened up that we used to have dinner at a few times.  Yeah.  Mickey Tettlebombs.  Come down to Mickey Tettlebombs.  Get yourself a Haedan Shillelagh.  The Blarney Stone.  The Blarney Stone.  Was it the Blarney Stone?  I don't remember. 
[00:50:30]  Kevin from Connecticut.  I don't remember that one.  Oh, no.  Come and get a warm beer at Mickey.  I forgot his goddamn name already.  Tettlebomb.  What is he, an Irish Jew?  I guess so.  One more thing about Tebow.  No, they did a poll.  Ah.  But I want to know who they polled.  Maybe if someone knows, that'd be great.  People?  Well, they polled a bunch of people, but were they of the religious variety to begin with?  Because 43% of them believe God is actually helping Tebow. 
[00:51:00]  Some fucks.  But if you went to Times Square, let's say, and no real agenda just pulling people that  are walking around down there, I don't think it would be 43%.  And say, do you believe in God?  But it must have been some kind of congregation or something, right?  It has to be.  Because that number's way too high.  No.  You know, I've noticed whenever they do...  You think the average person would say, well, 43% of the average people just walking around  would say that God is actually helping Tebow?  Yeah.  You do?  I've noticed whenever they do these religious-themed polls, it's usually a little under or just 
[00:51:30]  about 50% of the people, no matter what the question is, because the whole gist of it  is, do you believe in God?  This isn't, do you believe God's helping Tebow?  It's, do you believe in God?  Because once you believe in God, then you have to go with the fact that if he's praying  to win, that God is helping him.  So, you know, it doesn't really make sense.  The question doesn't make sense.  The question really just boils down to, do you believe in God?  And 43% of the people do. 
[00:52:00]  Would you want the answer?  No, I don't care.  Do you have the poll online there, Sam?  Got the poll in his pants, right?  That big dick.  I want to see who they polled for this one.  But they're saying 43% believe God actually helping Tebow.  Yeah.  But that's stupid, because there's like natural disasters and stuff while he's playing.  People never, they just go with that God works in mysterious ways thing, and they blow  all that shit off and think that he's actually watching the Denver game.  But you've got to break it down. 
[00:52:30]  There's some disaster where thousands of people are dying, and God has decided that  the football is way more important than maybe making sure those people are safe from a  natural disaster.  Oh, but the Lord works in mysterious ways.  That's the answer.  I'm very confused.  If God is helping Tebow win football games, then God's a dick.  And I'll say that very, very assertively.  If that's what God is worried about, he's a fucking idiot.  Well, his job is to answer prayers.  You got the poll thing?  Yeah, it's poll position.  It's a website that just has cute names. 
[00:53:00]  Wow, what a boring website that would be.  It's actually like a mattress place called the Lumbar Yard.  It's poll position.  The Lumbar Yard.  Oh, my God.  I loved that.  What are you doing?  Is that what you're going to say?  Seinfeld.  Oh, okay, okay.  Because as you were talking, I was wondering what that mic would look like if it was an  IED just blowing up.  But that makes sense.  Right in my fizz.  And what a coincidence.  Here to talk about the poll position is Dr. Gay. 
[00:53:30]  They call him Dr. Gay.  No one calls me that.  Everybody, it's Dr. Gay.  He's got a PhD, ICK.  Ah, see?  It's not even that bad.  What do you got there?  I was going to say that ESPN, he was also voted most popular athlete for December by ESPN.  That is the most popular.  It's the most seen and known and out there. 
[00:54:00]  He's the most popular athlete right now.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  He's probably the most popular person right now, Tim Tebow.  Sure.  Easy.  Everyone's talking about it.  Who are some of those other athletes that should be up there?  I don't know.  How many more athletes we got?  Who else we got, really?  Michael Jordan.  Basketball just kind of started up, so no one's like...  Oh, active duty athletes?  Well, I mean, yeah.  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  You've got to pick LeBron.  I would say LeBron is top five, sure.  What about Kobe? 
[00:54:30]  Kobe.  Kobe's always up there.  He doesn't know as much anymore, is he?  Tom Brady.  He's sort of Brady.  Brady up there.  Brady.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's about it.  I kind of want to see Tebow win, even though he annoys you with his fucking horse shit in public.  The whole world wants to see Tebow win, unless you're listening to us in New England.  Only next week, though.  Or this week.  I don't know why, but I don't know why.  Because what he does religiously is his business, but I don't know why, because it doesn't make sense.  That's why I want him to win.  People want to see him win, because he's such a terrible quarterback.  Dude, he had ten completions against the Steelers. 
[00:55:00]  Have you seen him throw a ball?  It's awful.  His mechanics are terrible.  He knows how to throw downfield, though.  But he can't throw them through those windows.  He throws like a...  He throws.  I kind of want to see his personal life.  I would like him to come out and go, look, there's something I've been hiding.  You might have told, by the way, I gesticulate when I speak, and my hands are all every which away.  Every which away?  All up in the air.  Pats are favored by two touchdowns.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, boy. 
[00:55:30]  What's this poll about?  Where do they get the people?  I think it's just their first vote.  Oh, so it's not just religious people.  No, it's just general population.  General pop, but you're going to get half the people are going to be religious.  Wow.  In a way where they believe in God and believe that if you pray to God, you know, he's going  to help you in one way or another.  That's their faith, and that's where that percentage comes from.  So those people are idiots because that means God cares more about football than all the  other crazy shit that happens on a daily basis.  Do you profess to know what God thinks, Opie? 
[00:56:00]  Do you fancy yourself a God?  Because you don't know God is multitasking.  Someone should find out what happened last Sunday when God was focused on Tebow's amazing  game there.  Death and destruction.  God helped Tebow, but what didn't he help on Sunday?  Last Sunday.  While God was helping Tebow, some kid somewhere was getting molested.  There was a kid getting molested. 
[00:56:30]  That's why it's so confusing.  While God was busy watching Tim Tebow and the Broncos blow a two-touch down lead.  Maybe the molester was praying to God for a cute kid.  And I want the list of Steelers players that believe in God, but God didn't listen to those  guys.  Well, he works in mysterious ways.  That's the whole fucking blow off right there.  You don't have to explain shit.  That's a cop out of God.  Mysterious ways.  I'm not a fan of the cop out in religion.  Mysterious ways.  And that's it.  Then what I have to do is shut up at that point. 
[00:57:00]  Mysterious ways.  And what do I got?  Nothing.  He moves in mysterious ways.  It's aight.  It's aight.  Aight.  Yeah.  Our tongue baby.  Yeah.  You too.  On the home of rock and roll.  NotYouTube.com.  See Joe.  Yeah, absolutely.  He does this song great.  I think this is George Michael.  What? 
[00:57:30]  You're kidding.  No, it sounds like a George Michael song.  What's the George Michael song that sounds like?  Wham?  The beginning of that sounds like a wham.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounds just like it, actually.  Yeah.  They ripped off Sabbath and wham.  Good job.  Oh my god, does this sound like wham.  Yeah.  I never thought that.  I like when a chorus kicks in.  Pretty good.  It's all right. 
[00:58:00]  It's all right.  It's all right.  She moves in mysterious ways.  Yeah.  It's all right.  It's all right.  All right.  She moves in mysterious ways.  I used to hate you two.  Until your brother started making money off them?  And then, yeah.  And then, actually, when Joe and 2U started playing out, it was kind of like I heard him enough where I kind of liked him. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  I love you, too.  Oh, no.  Still one of my favorites.  He's a little wain enough, too, is he?  Was a little wain, though.  Apparently he has a sports video blog.  Is he drinking his scissor as he does this?  He doesn't do that anymore.  What?  That's right.  How do you get off the scissor?  He's not sober, I don't think.  He just doesn't, he claims not to do the scissor up anymore.  Apparently he's got a sports blog.  He's got, this is Wheezy's Sports Corner.  It looks a lot like the ESPN logo.  It's hugely popular.  Is he going to pick all the games that we were about to pick? 
[00:59:00]  Because that would be great to hear a little wain do it.  He's only got 12,000 views.  Nobody knows about this.  Maybe it's just, maybe this is just one copy of it.  No, it's cash money.  Hey, some of us appreciate a video that does 12,000 views there, Sam.  Damn.  Wow.  When was it put up?  Sam.  Wheezy.  An hour ago?  Last week.  Oh, shit.  No, the 8th, right?  Yeah, last week.  Nobody cared.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  Oh, so this was before last week's games, right?  Or Monday?  I don't know if he's a Green Bay fan or not. 
[00:59:30]  I would think.  Where's he from?  New Orleans.  I don't know.  He's got a Saints hat.  Yeah.  He's a Saints fan.  He's fair.  Are they out or are they still playing?  He just wants Saints.  Saints are playing the 49ers.  And I got to go 49ers.  Have fun with that.  That's my team.  I want them to win it all.  It's not going to happen.  Do you remember every year the 49ers would win that division?  Sure.  They were unbeatable.  Well, they had the best combination possibly ever.  Ravens over the Texans?  Yes.  I'm going with that.  And then Giants-Packers.  Can't go Giants ever, so I go Packers. 
[01:00:00]  You got any picks here, Ant?  Anything that you care about?  Well, I'll give you it.  Saints 49ers.  Saints 49ers, I got to go with the 49ers.  I like that Joe Montana.  He's not playing anymore, you fucking asshole.  Oh, sorry.  See, I got mixed up.  What about Texans and Ravens?  I really don't even have a fucking opinion on that game. 
[01:00:30]  Ravens.  Well, you got to have an opinion.  You gots to go Ravens.  And then what about the Giants-Packers?  I want to go Giants, but I think the Pack's got that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And some asshole on the paper today is saying that the NFL has to finally step in and get  rid of the Packers' touchdown celebration thing.  You see that on the paper today?  No.  Fucking idiots.  Just let it happen.  It's fucking fun.  Stop taking all the fun out of sports.  No fun allowed. 
[01:01:00]  Waste the time.  Where's the article?  It might be behind you if you care enough to bring it to our attention.  Do you remember if it was in the post?  Ah, those papers are all the same.  They are.  I don't know.  If you find it real quick, no problem.  You want to hear some Tebow songs?  Of course.  These are good.  Everyone has talked about the Jimmy Fallon one.  I think he did last night.  Yeah.  He did David Bowie plus Tim Tebow equals Tebowie.  Tebowie.  Tebowie.  Listen to this. 
[01:01:30]  It's good.  So far, I like it.  I like it.  A little loud.  A little loud.  I believe that's one of them peckers right there.  Wow, NBC has to have their logo on the screen for 30 seconds?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Sam.  Sam.  Who are you talking to?  What are you doing?  You're ruining everything.  The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC.  What's going on with this?  I guess Sam doesn't want to play the video.  It's the Peacock.  Watch it play, Sam.  Stop fudging around.  But the Peacock is animated. 
[01:02:00]  It's kind of moving, but we're not getting any...  Quit futzing around.  There's a bar.  Oh, man.  There's a problem with loading.  Wow, they really want to make sure this video came from NBC.  Everybody loves...  Oh, thank God.  Commercial.  Are you serious?  Oh, what the hell?  It's a 15-seconder.  Yeah, I can handle the 15 seconds.  And it is for Charmin.  Well, yeah.  I hope Mars is paying attention.  Yeah, really.  For the first time, Tim Tebow and David Bowie together as one. 
[01:02:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, T. Bowie.  He's got the glam rock thing on.  Yeah.  But he's also wearing kind of shoulder pads and a Broncos jersey.  Tim Tebow to Jesus Christ.  Tim Tebow to Jesus Christ. 
[01:03:00]  Can't win by myself, but with your help I might.  Tim Tebow to Jesus Christ.  Seven, three, six.  Commencing, fork down, hut, hut, hike.  To snap the football and may God's love be with me.  This is Jesus Christ to Tim Tebow. 
[01:03:30]  Please leave me alone.  Don't you know, my day of rest is Sunday.  And I'm sick of watching all these Broncos games.  I hear that you play New England next week.  Dude, you're on your own. 
[01:04:00]  Brady is too good and I've got better things to do.  Though I'm past 316 yards, there's still two games to go.  If I want to make it to the Super Bowl  And show everyone on earth how to Tebow 
[01:04:30]  Tim Tebow to Jesus Christ, the Broncos won  We're still alive  Come on, everyone, Tebow  Come on, everyone, Tebow  Come on, everyone, Tebow  Come on, everyone, Tebow  Jesus  That's fucking good, man.  That's quite a production.  And he sounds just like Bowie.  Fuck.  He's always been a pretty good singer that... 
[01:05:00]  He has an amazing voice for a comic.  Yeah.  Jesus.  He looks like Bowie.  That was part of the Fallon charm.  Bravo to Jimmy Fallon.  So...  No one's going to have a better Tebow song than that.  That's...  Yeah, that kind of, you know, it's on fucking network television.  Wow.  We just had an idea.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I know what they're even thinking here. 
[01:05:30]  You got it already?  Of course.  Okay.  It just fucking...  It fits.  It's such a good idea.  You don't even have to shoehorn it in.  We're going to be writing today.  No.  No.  No.  No.  You want me to write it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's so obvious.  It's so obvious.  Is it a combination?  I'm lost.  No.  I am.  It's just...  It's so easy.  Very good.  The next Tim Tebow song, Ant. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Four minutes long.  There's no way we're going to do it.  Four fucking pompous minutes.  There's no way we're going to do four minutes.  Remember John Parr?  Yes.  You do?  Yeah.  Name two songs if you remember them.  St. Elmo's Fire.  Good.  And the other one.  Come on.  Which is...  Let me think of that one.  I liked the other one a little better.  Come on.  Oh, God.  I just need a fucking...  You got it?  Two seconds.  Hold on.  Don't play it yet.  Because...  Come on.  All right.  Let me think of this. 
[01:06:30]  You're missing the obvious one.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Naughty, naughty.  Fuck.  He got it.  T-t-t-t-tease me.  T-t-t-t-tee-bow.  This was a huge hit.  Oh, yeah.  Remember this?  The John Paul.  Naughty, naughty.  Never heard this.  Oh, you never heard this?  No.  This song's got to be 25 years old easy.  Yep.  Mid-80s, maybe. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, he had that gravelly voice.  I think this was part of...  I think this was on GTA, too, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Oh, the 80s one?  I think it was.  Do you want to see a grown man cry?  We'll just try to get to the heart.  Yes.  Yes.  Baby, this could be the first time.  This could be the first time. 
[01:07:30]  Look at that.  The orchestra dropped that fucking...  Swamp!  Swamp, swamp, swamp.  Swamp, swamp.  Take it easy.  Fucking, squeezing, running, running, running.  I'm a loaded, loaded guy.  Yeah.  That was a pretty big hit back in the 80s.  The 80s.  And then John Parr went away for a very long time.  And then this song popped up yesterday, I believe, or maybe a couple days ago now. 
[01:08:00]  And it's a Tim Tebow song done to the St. Elmo's Fire theme.  Which he did, of course, for the movie.  And I'm like, oh, wow, that guy kind of sounds like the guy.  And it is the guy.  That's how bad his life has gotten.  He's now doing Tim Tebow parody songs.  Yeah, when I heard it, I was like, wow.  Using his old music.  Guy's doing a great impression.  Right.  And then, no, it's him.  Four minutes, though.  He's pulling his fucking original fucking tapes out.  His masters.  Right. 
[01:08:30]  Going to the studio.  Do you want the new lyrics so you can follow along?  Oh, yeah.  Let me see.  Ooh.  That's all.  Oh, there you go.  Take one, pass it down.  Oh, God.  The red or the new ones.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Wait, that's the original lyrics. 
[01:09:00]  The red or the new ones, is it?  The red is the new.  Oh.  That's the original lyrics.  Well, because the original lyrics kind of work.  Original lyrics, obviously.  All you can do, I must be done.  Now he changes it again, yeah.  You know, I'll find a bear.  Terrible days.  The friends are done.  And you're trying to break free.  There it comes. 
[01:09:30]  I can see a new horizon.  Underneath the blazing sky.  Happy when the eagle's flying higher than higher.  Still sounds just like it.  It is the original, yeah.  Take me down, my future's in line.  It's Tim Timo's fire.  Tim Timo's fire.  Oh.  Are we supposed to laugh there?  No, I think he's like dead serious.  Like, he's a big Broncos fan.  We should write a song about hemorrhoids called, uh,  Marcelino's fire about his asshole. 
[01:10:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Who's got a fish, your love?  I can make it.  I'm never a king.  You're going to avoid me.  But you won't break the man.  I can see a new horizon.  I can see a new horizon.  There's a number of miles high.  He's good.  Yeah, he's good.  Only kids.  Higher, I am higher. 
[01:10:30]  Couldn't be a man in motion.  All I need is my vocal team.  Take me down, my future's in line.  Tim Timo's fire.  That sounds so stupid.  Tim Timo's fire.  Fucking sick.  I can build St. Elmo's fire.  We've been at St. Elmo's fire.  What happened?  Yeah, why don't you do the St. Elmo's fire?  He just wants to remind you what the real song is.  That's enough, right?  Yes.  That's enough.  That's quite enough.  You don't like that song?  There you go.  That stinks. 
[01:11:00]  That's one of the best 80s songs.  It's very nostalgic.  I'll give it that.  The original's a commercial.  Oh, yeah, that's great.  Yeah, that's all right.  Yeah, I'll give you that.  John Parr.  There you go.  All nostalgic.  Now there might be a bit of a drop-off in the Tim Tebow song.  All right.  I haven't heard any of these.  Those are the two big ones out right now.  Are people going to go Tim Tebow?  Well, we're going to find out.  Tim Tebow.  Oh, this one's called The Lady Cake Boys.  Maybe that's who did it, I would think.  Yeah?  All right.  I don't know.  Danny pulled these fruity names. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know.  Let's see.  The next Tim Tebow song.  I like this song already.  Yeah?  Hit him high, hit him low.  Don't you know that the grass don't grow under the feet.  We got the all-time record in the SEC.  Best QB with the most D.  Tebow, Tebow, ready to go.  Tebow, Tebow, get better, bro. 
[01:12:00]  Rip up the dirt by pulling the foul.  Everybody get up for the underdog now.  Boss and throw, D-O-B, all-American.  We got the A-B-E.  It's too ethnic.  It's too ethnic for me.  Are we done with that one?  It's just not good.  Yeah.  I just didn't like it.  We'll cut our losses.  That's more like Tim Negro.  Let's try this one.  Yes.  Oh, auto-turn. 
[01:12:30]  Tebow.  Oh, you know how I love when they put the names in.  The first round was a steal.  Touchdowns on the field.  Making all the fans squeal.  He goal.  He hope.  Make Daniels a joke.  He's always in the air, but he never fly.  Coach.  He's playing such a trip.  Sailor of the ship.  A male give him lip.  Can he appreciate it?  Rewind the clocks back to year one.  That's what 15 was called to step up.  I say, excuse me, Tim.  You're a hell of a guy.  I mean, my, my, my, all-American guy. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, there's a fly playing at mile high.  From the Philippines on a mission for your dreams.  Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  Somebody please tell me.  Wow.  This is fucking fucked.  Cock-a-shot gun.  Was he trying to do an M&M thing?  Ugh.  It's Nicki Minaj.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, it's a Nicki Minaj song.  Well, it's not Nicki Minaj.  It's a Nicki Minaj song.  Here we go.  It's got my heartbeat running away.  Beating like a drum and it's turning away.  This is terrible.  Now we're passing T-Bo-Bo-Bo-T-Bo-Bo-T-Bo-T-Bo. 
[01:13:30]  Now we're passing T-Bo-Bo-Bo-T-Bo-T-Bo.  It's not a fucking time.  Stop it.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not good.  All right.  Not good.  Finally, this is the last one for today.  It's called T-Boat Time.  He was like this one.  God, nice fucking sound quality.  It's 2012.  Anyone can at least make it the sound good. 
[01:14:00]  Make the sound good.  We're good, fans, and we'll see.  We're good, fans, and we'll see.  We're good, fans, and we'll see.  Jaws drop as a touchdown's power.  The Broncos are running wild.  Running wild, brother.  He's ready to go.  T-Boat Time.  T-Boat Time.  And he starts to roll.  Looks now feel that the band's here.  Brakes to change and he's in the clear.  T-Boat Time.  T-Boat Time.  T-Boat Time. 
[01:14:30]  T-Boat Time.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, wait till.  I noticed you didn't finish any of those songs.  No.  No.  No.  That is really bad.  Yeah.  Fuck.  God, that's annoying.  Should we go back to John Parr?  Yeah, why not?  Eek.  All right, well.  Good luck to all those people because I'm sure they thought when they put that out, it 
[01:15:00]  was just going to fucking take off.  God, those are terrible.  Be adopted by the Broncos as their team song playing out there.  I'd be surprised if they took the St. Elmo's Fire one.  That's a legitimate guy.  Yeah, they would use that.  Play that.  Tim T-Bo's Fire.  Tim T-Bo's Fire.  You notice he didn't say Tim T-Bo's Flame.  It doesn't make sense.  It's like hell.  Like hell is where the fire is and stuff, so that doesn't make sense.  He's a holy man.  He's a man of the cloth. 
[01:15:30]  Yipes.  I think it's a perfect place to break.  There's nothing we could do with those songs.  No, not a goddamn thing.  Just enjoy them.  Yeah, let them just sit.  Let them just simmer in our heads then.  Why don't we do that?  Why don't we get back to the Philly mayor?  Yeah.  Calling a lot of people assholes.  Yeah.  And good and well he should.  Somebody's got to speak up.  We'll explain next.  Or shenanigans.  Oh, yeah.  Do you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did the people who saw no signs of CES, was that a Sirius XM actually booth or was that  a car company that had the, just a Sirius XM sign with Oprah and Howard, whoever else they  had on it?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  No one's actually clear on anything.  It doesn't matter.  I just like bitching. 
[01:16:30]  The list of the nerves.  I don't really care about facts.  E-Rock got burned in the bathroom.  Good.  E-Rock got burned badly in the bathroom.  He's trying to downplay it.  A toothy glory hole.  It has something to do with CES too because we were at the urinal talking shit and E-Rock  goes, you know what?  We're not representing that CES.  Well, it gets worse than that.  I go, what?  He goes, well, Sirius XM has put new posters in the lobby and we don't have a poster.  They got Howard. 
[01:17:00]  Even Jason Ellis has a poster in the lobby and I am literally a split second from losing  my fucking mind and you hear from the stall, you never talk shit when the stall doors are  closed, you idiot.  Our bathroom, for the people that don't know, there's what?  Three urinals?  Four urinals.  And then behind is like five or six stalls like right there.  And I don't talk my shit if I know a door is closed.  That's just stupid.  So I'm about to lose my fucking mind and you hear someone in mid shit go, posters coming 
[01:17:30]  next week.  It's Gary in the stall.  Oh, I saw Gary when I came out of the bathroom too.  The Open Anthony posters coming next week?  Yeah.  Good.  But Gary knew damn well that I was about to just motherfuck him and everybody else.  And you know, you don't want to hear what people have to say about you ever.  It's like Eddie Murphy in the stall during fucking Trading Places.  Yeah, exactly.  You don't want to hear Mortimer and his brother.  Exactly.  Do you know, it's funny, they're probably going to surprise the show with the poster.  That was probably meant to be a surprise. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  It's like, hey guys, look at this.  And a company doing something nice.  Surprise.  All the other posters are up.  But I'm saying that's...  So that's my bitch today.  Why didn't our posters go up at the first round?  That's probably why.  They weren't going to surprise us?  No, maybe they were just going to put the posters up.  But Gary in mid shit had to fucking pipe up immediately because he knew some things were going to be said.  I just didn't want to hear himself called a babysitter.  He's just trying to take a dump and relax.  No, the new one is secretary. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, he's a good egg.  I like him.  I like Gary.  He means well.  He's got glasses.  That's wonderful.  He had better eyesight.  I'd like him more.  I told Gary, just get 20-20.  We can hang out.  I don't hang on people with glasses.  No.  It makes me look bad.  That's right.  Exactly.  We're looking at two guys that might need glasses in the very near future.  So...  We'll find another radio show.  Anthony with his fucking billboard font on his phone.  Believe me. 
[01:19:00]  I know.  You and Keith Robinson.  It's like giant letters.  It's like watching that Times Square building scroll.  I really did step it up to the big fucking font.  It's...  I fucking try to read things.  Like, even in here, I grab the newspaper in the morning and try to read, and I'm just  squinting, and I have a headache right now.  As we speak, I have a headache.  I have to now drive with glasses again.  Oh, no.  Remember, I was a LASIK guy.  Yeah.  I wore glasses my entire life, and somewhere around the year 1999, I got my eyes did. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  And at one point, I was seeing 2015, I was seeing some holy shit stuff, and now they  said, you know, you get in your 40s, the muscles start wearing down a little bit, so  now I need driving glasses.  Yeah.  That's because I got a kid, though.  That was the promise I made.  Oh, that you would?  Because...  Yeah, my night driving is atrocious.  Is it really?  And I finally had to give in and go, all right, now that we got a kid, all right.  Time to... 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Step it up.  I'll get driving glasses.  You know who needs to do the same thing you're doing?  Who?  Kenny?  Oh, boy.  He's coming in already.  Oh, shit.  How bad is his...  His night driving stinks.  Night driving is horrifying.  He panics.  What happens with you there, Kenny?  No, my night driving is only compounded by fatigue.  Oh.  No, it's not.  Fatigue of the passenger with you.  Yeah.  No, but he needs Kenny's glasses at night.  James is a pleasure to be around. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he's very pleasant.  He's talkative.  You know, he's a good conversationalist.  He has no problem when traffic slows down a little bit.  No, no, James is the ultimate optimist.  He just goes with it.  He just goes with it.  Yeah.  James knows how to go with the flow.  Now, the thing is, I want Kenny to have glasses before he drives at night.  Yeah?  Yes, he has them and he drives better, but he's a guy's guy and he doesn't like to put  his little old lady glasses on.  Well, the problem with driving glasses, as soon as you want to look down on your shit,  that's all blurry. 
[01:21:00]  Exactly.  And it fucking makes you nauseous.  Exactly.  Me and you can relate.  All right, cool.  How about this?  Mine's just reading, thank God.  Don't look down at stuff that will make you nauseous.  I prefer you see the truck in front of us.  Yeah, looking at your intestines on the road might make you nauseous, too.  Yeah, there's really nothing else you need to look down at.  Kevin from Connecticut saying I could get a prescription windshield.  Is that shit available yet?  Come on.  Well, let's slow down a minute.  Why not?  That's such bullshit.  How cool would that be?  No one else would be able to drive your car, though. 
[01:21:30]  Exactly.  That's funny.  That would be great.  That's someone's bit.  By the way, Electric Dave from Flint, Michigan.  Ant's a big fan of Flint, Michigan.  Yeah, great.  Big fan of Michael Moore.  Michael Moore.  You love Michael Moore.  No, he doesn't.  Michael Moore.  Dude, your tweet about Michael Moore, I have to say, made me fucking howl.  Your latest one?  Oh, the one with the picture?  Of the train?  Yeah.  That made me fucking howl.  He tweeted that he was on the Amtrak going to Washington, D.C. 
[01:22:00]  The simplicity of that tweet was fucking brilliant.  He says what?  I'm on my way to Washington?  To Washington, D.C. by Amtrak.  And all I put was exclusive photo.  And it was, I found the little engine that could.  And the little engine that could is struggling.  Right when he's at the top of the hill and the little engine face is sweating.  And it's got a grimace on it.  Smokes pouring out of the stack.  You can just tell his wheels are like oval because they're trying to get up that track.  He's basically saying that Michael Moore is a big fat load that would slow down any train. 
[01:22:30]  I didn't get what that meant.  He just explained it.  You didn't get it?  It's the little engine that could.  Didn't mommy ever read you the little engine that could?  My uncle did.  Oh, God.  Well.  The train was always going into a dark tunnel.  Yeah, the train goes in and it backs up.  It's got duty on it.  Oh, boy.  So Electric Dave in Flint, Michigan writes,  Opie won't talk shit in the bathroom with a closed stall door because someone might be in there, 
[01:23:00]  but then gets on the radio and motherfucks everybody.  You don't want to do it in the bathroom.  It's just poor taste.  Because this part, this isn't real life.  Right.  It's radio.  It's radio.  That's more real life in the stall.  When you hear it coming from a bathroom, holy shit, that hurts way more than if you  hear it coming through a radio show.  Have you ever made yourself known because people had started talking about you?  All the time.  You just don't want to hear it.  No.  After shows, I always make sure they know I'm in the bathroom.  I don't want to hear it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That fucking sucked. 
[01:23:30]  No, it doesn't.  Oh, Bob.  No, it doesn't even get to that point.  If you know that there's a possibility the conversation could start heading toward your way,  oh, all the fucking time.  Yeah, it is kind of frightening.  I don't think there's a person alive that wants to hear someone talking shit about them  while they're in a stall.  No.  You think Obama has to deal with that?  All the time in the White House.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Catches everybody at N.  Sometimes I.  Someone's saying, well, I don't know where contacts. 
[01:24:00]  Can you wear contacts if you only need them for driving?  I'm confused.  I don't know either.  Because the shit in front of me is all fucking blurry and makes me nauseous.  Oh, look.  You know, it's me and Jimmy.  Come on.  I've lost a little bit of weight.  Today I'm dressed like a sweater boy cutie.  Why are you dressed like a sweater boy cutie?  That's my new name.  But why?  Why are you wearing a sweater?  You got something going on?  No.  Just being a sweater boy cutie.  All right.  I decided to put my sweater on today. 
[01:24:30]  I wanted to wear my cardigan.  Cardigan?  No, my cashmere.  Cashmere.  Cashmere.  It's my new name, by the way.  I won't answer the chat anymore.  What is it now?  Sweater boy cutie.  Sweater boy cutie.  Wow.  Did Sam really quit the show?  I hope so.  He did?  I hope he quits life.  Which one?  You got that pissed?  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  No, Sam's writing our idea. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, really?  A bit.  Hey.  Menino.  Us?  Oh.  Why would we be on TV?  Menino, he looks all bloated.  This is a 1999.  What's he saying?  Can we get him?  He's betting shit.  Pull him up.  I can't.  Shit.  I'm over there.  I'm over here now.  I can pull that shit up.  I can't pull this shit up.  We can't get Squawk Box up?  No.  Doesn't he look bloaty or something?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  He sits there with his mouth agape because it cannot hold that tongue. 
[01:25:30]  You know how horrible his breath is?  Because he can't keep his mouth closed.  That shit's drying up.  Well, it's just looking at him without the sound.  Oh, we want this, Mars.  Oh, okay.  Yo.  Yo, let's go.  Why would you leave this?  I asked for your firing, by the way, during the break.  Yo, where's Marcelino?  He's working.  Put it on.  Excuse me.  Some guy named Lewis that I guess you're pals with, I asked him if he could fire you.  Thank you.  Why would you do that, Opster?  Just to mix things up a little bit. 
[01:26:00]  You don't have enough excitement in your life?  Will you get this on?  Guaranteed, it's one of those situations.  The second it comes on, he's going to be done.  We want to thank Mayor Menino.  Well, I know he's betting Sam Adams for the big game.  The big game.  Is he?  Oh, he's not?  Oh, no.  Come on.  Of course.  What are you doing?  Put the TV on.  Oh, this is some kind of political.  Come on.  Thought thing.  You got it?  No.  SPC is trying to watch something. 
[01:26:30]  Epic fail right here.  Watch this fail.  Can't we just turn the volume on?  Come on.  SPC wants to see it.  Yeah, you can do that.  That's not professional.  Yeah, this isn't.  It's always that clear.  When you have a doer, you get things, you can get criticized.  So is that going to be a fair argument for folks like Gingrich to make?  But obviously, there's an expectation that Obama's going to be making that argument and  making it hard.  I think it's going to be a decision that Obama will make to take on the nominee.  But also, you know, we're talking about the real issues that affect American people. 
[01:27:00]  Well, no, I never hear the issue of housing, jobs, education, public safety.  Never?  That's all they talk about, you fat idiot.  They have not addressed that issue at all.  They talk about these issues that don't affect real people.  Talk about zzzzzzzzzz.  Why is his face so squishy?  It is really bloated.  Yes.  We haven't addressed any of those issues yet.  I've watched those debates.  I say, my God, who are they appealing to?  They're not appealing to the working people that I represent.  He almost said May, but he caught himself. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Mayor, this is Samuel Kaye.  I think the discussion on being capital is an absolute distraction.  He coughed his tongue out of his mouth.  Yeah, Blythe Danner wants to talk to him.  Who is this bitch?  You do live with Mitt Romney's legacy in Boston.  It would be interesting to hear your perspective even on health care and how that has transpired.  He is painful to watch.  You fixate on his mouth.  I think the package that was passed by the legislature with the governor being there at that time and Senator Kennedy really being the individual who really pushed out legislation. 
[01:28:00]  I think it's good.  Then, of course, it's change.  It's change.  The powerful forces in America don't want change when it comes to health care.  And that's so unfortunate.  We know how expensive it is.  We've got to change it, but why is the American Medical Association, all those other groups rally against change in health care?  Try to go see the doctor.  They give you five minutes of their time.  They have 25 appointments.  Not like the old days when they had time to see you and talk to you about your medical needs.  I just say that health care is number one, education, jobs. 
[01:28:30]  What about jobs?  How are we going to create jobs in America?  I mean, let's get real about those issues.  No one's talking about jobs in this day and age.  You know, we have all these individuals coming back from the conflicts.  And what are the opportunities they're going to have for real jobs in America and housing and the future for their children and their families?  Mr. Menino, I have to say I'm conflicted asking you a question.  I'm a Yankee fan.  Oh, that's a mistake.  It makes it hard for me, but I do love your city, so I get to go for it. 
[01:29:00]  There it comes.  I'll try to talk with respect.  What is it that Washington could do for the city of Boston that you would like to see the next president or this president do?  Are we done with this?  Yeah.  I think it makes fiscal sense for the federal government.  I think, you know, what has to happen is a partnership.  You know who that bald guy looks like a young version of?  What's happened in America today?  Everything's so partisan.  It's Democrats, Republicans.  A Democratic issue.  A Republican issue. 
[01:29:30]  All right, enough.  The Chinese going crazy over their iPhones.  His, uh, his, uh.  Yeah.  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, the Chinese.  There's an Apple store there in Chinese.  And the Chinese were mad because it didn't open at 7 like they said it was going to.  So they started throwing eggs at the iStore.  Who brings eggs to a phone store?  And that'll make them opening up their store faster, right?  The Chinese.  Who brings eggs to a fucking Apple store?  I don't know.  It's like bringing apples to the egg store. 
[01:30:00]  And then they canceled the whole launch.  They did?  Yeah.  Why?  They don't want eggs on their products.  Oh.  Angry customers and gangs of scalpers.  They're probably making omelets or something.  Am I right, Trav?  I don't think that's what they're doing.  The iPhone Forest was canceled due to concerns over the size of the crowd.  There were so many Chinese people at the launch here in the United States.  Just buying.  They couldn't even speak English. 
[01:30:30]  They'd pull out a lot of fucking cash and buy these phones.  And you know they were just like mules.  And they're allowed.  Yeah.  Why?  Because Apple doesn't have a policy against that.  If you want to buy a phone without a contract, you can go.  They can go.  You just buy the maximum.  And Apple knows what they're doing.  But that's their policy.  That should be their policy.  None of their business where their phones are being.  None of your business.  That's right.  None of the fucking beeswax.  That's right.  Be nice.  Speaking of politics, we've got a Philadelphia mayor there. 
[01:31:00]  Yes.  I like him.  He is saying some shit.  Yeah.  You know, Philly's out of control with these fucking people.  Doing their hijinks and shenanigans with their illegal guns.  It's not out of control where I go, sir.  Well, I'm sure there's nice areas everywhere.  But the mayor has had it, right?  He's had it.  He wants the parents, you know, to watch over their kids more better.  Even in outrage, Mayor Nutter spoke out about the crime. 
[01:31:30]  The first way to stop this kind of stuff is for young people to be home where they're  supposed to be home and for adults not to act like idiots and assholes out in the streets  of our city shooting at kids in a car.  That's great.  Idiots and assholes.  Bravo.  I love that guy.  Good.  He's a black guy, right?  The mayor?  Mayor Nutter.  Yeah, I love him.  No fluff from Nutter.  Wow.  I used to love fluff and Nutter.  Of course you did.  I hated it. 
[01:32:00]  Because you had to mix it with peanut butter.  It's a tasty treat.  You needed that jelly to make it all nice.  Yeah.  Peanut butter and jelly.  Always.  Fluff and Nutter taste.  Peanut butter sucks.  Makes the smell of sweaty skin go away.  You don't like peanut butter?  No, I hate it.  You're a communist.  No, I'm not.  How do you not like peanut butter?  George Washington Carver.  It's too, yeah.  Well, that's one thing.  It's too, somebody said on Twitter the other day that peanut butter is not an invention. 
[01:32:30]  It's a recipe.  They always say, oh, the scientists, if I ground up some peanuts, stop it.  But no, the peanut butter is too overbearing when you put it in anything.  I don't like it in chocolate.  I don't like it on bananas.  I don't like it.  Peanut butter cookies that fall apart?  I hate peanut butter cookies.  Where they're all soft in the middle and warm?  Why not just have an oatmeal cookie?  It's sweet and nice.  You don't like a Reese's peanut butter cup? 
[01:33:00]  Hate it.  Give me just chocolate.  You never like peanut butter?  I don't like it, no.  Peanut butter and jelly?  No, whenever I bit into something that had peanut butter in it, it went right out.  Hated it.  Hated it.  Still do.  Hate it.  It's overbearing.  It's a standalone butter.  Do you eat peanuts?  Butter.  Do you eat peanuts?  Peanuts I will eat, but I don't chew them to the point of butter. 
[01:33:30]  What's your favorite peanut?  I let them remain a little granular.  Wait, do you like a little bit of peanut butter?  Like a light?  Because a big peanut butter thing makes your mouth sticky.  And hates being sticky.  I love a lot of peanut butter.  He hates your legs.  It has nothing to do with that.  It's all about the taste.  Okay.  Hate it.  You don't like peanut butter ice cream?  No!  What a cheeseburger.  Oh my God!  What's wrong with you?  Stop it with you!  Fuck that shit!  Vanilla chocolate.  Where they barely mix the peanut butter into the ice cream so you get some deliciousness.  How could you fuck ice cream up? 
[01:34:00]  Oh my God!  By throwing peanut butter in it.  You like peanut butter on celery?  What is it?  The Reese's peanut butter ice cream?  Oh.  To die for.  What else don't you like?  To die for.  Fuck that.  What else don't you like?  Big clits?  No.  That's disgusting.  Peanut butter ice cream.  It rules.  How do you fucking...  Oh, it's the best.  How do you ravage ice cream like that?  It's amazing.  It's the best.  Can we get some right now?  Would you like some Reese's Pieces ice cream?  Oh, I would fucking love it.  Boy, would I.  Reese's Pieces.  Give me M&M's. 
[01:34:30]  Fuck Reese's Pieces in their asses.  Not a fan of the Reese's Peanut...  What are they called?  Reese's Pieces.  Not a fan of those.  Where they look like M&M's, but they're...  Oh, they're cool.  Not a fan.  Yeah, but you gotta eat a whole handful of them to even...  That's why this is all candy.  Yeah, but you might as well...  No, but you might as well just have a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  I believe the M&M company has come up with one of those, too.  I'm a Raisinette guy over Goobers any day.  Yes.  They're both terrible.  Yes, that's fine.  They're both terrible?  Well...  I think fucking all I like is Goobers. 
[01:35:00]  I hate Goobers.  Skittles.  Skittles.  Skittles.  Always first.  Always first.  I like Skittles.  Skittles.  I need Skittles over Goobers.  Yeah, I don't like Goobers, so maybe you're right there.  Goobers and Raisinettes.  Goobers and Raisinettes.  Goobers are delicious.  Peanuts covered in chocolate.  Raisinettes are raisins covered in chocolate, too.  Goobers and Raisinettes.  Goobers.  And wondered at his final words, Goobers and Raisinettes. 
[01:35:30]  Opie's thumb in Cleveland.  Anthony likes old lady candy.  No!  And then he goes...  What do you think?  I'm eating those Mary Janes?  Then he goes, I bet he likes Werther's original, too.  Oh, I don't like a good Werther original.  What is a Werther?  I just know that's funny.  A Werther original?  I'm trying to remember what a Werther original is.  Butterscotch!  Oh, no.  Those are pretty good, though.  You like butterscotch? 
[01:36:00]  I like ribbon candy.  I like fucking putting a fucking concertina wire in my mouth.  That stuff's a hazard.  Ribbon candy sucks.  Ribbon candy.  Grandma would always have ribbon candy around the holidays.  Here, chew this flavored glass.  What happens to old people that they enjoy that shitty candy?  They're stupid.  Yeah, they're dumb.  Dementia.  Sour bowls.  I used to like eating the wax teeth after you were done playing with them.  Ugh.  Flavorless wax. 
[01:36:30]  Well, those wax bottles that would have the imitation soda inside.  Those are good.  It was just syrupy stuff.  And then you had to eat the wax.  Wax was big.  They would sell kids just wax.  To chew on.  Here, here's some wax.  See this, kid.  Chew this candle shaped like teeth, you little jerk-off.  And dots.  You'd eat a fucking ton of paper.  He'd be shitting out pieces of paper because he couldn't get the dots off the paper.  We fucking, Bob Levy had a joke about those.  For years, we fucking teased it.  It was an awful joke.  I don't even know if he ever did it. 
[01:37:00]  I don't know if he actually did it on stage.  But he was going to do a college or something.  He goes, yeah, let's do this joke about dots.  I'm like, why would you eat those?  He's like, you're throwing sugar on a newspaper.  It's a terrible idea.  And this was fucking 17 years ago.  Wow.  We fucking, for years, we talked about that awful joke.  Just beat the shit out of him about his dumb joke.  Wintergreen.  I hate winter.  People always use wintergreen to cover up their shitty breath.  And it never fucking works.  No.  If you have chronically bad breath. 
[01:37:30]  Wintergreen.  Wintergreen is not helping you.  No.  Go to the fucking dentist.  Wintergreen.  Get your fucking gums cleaned out.  What about rock candy?  Did you get that when you went upstate?  Rock candy, yeah.  It was just what?  That was always a special little treat.  Didn't see a lot of it.  Nope.  In what I call the day, there was rock candy at like the stationery store.  Well, all stores are stationery.  Well, that's true. 
[01:38:00]  I like the moving stores.  All right.  You got me.  All right.  You got me.  What does this fat fuck want?  You're not lady trucker.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, good morning, fellas.  Hello, sweetie.  I would like to listen to how confidently Anthony delivered that line about the stand-alone butter.  Yeah, I know, right?  There is no reason to ever take a call from this woman.  You have 11 hours and zero minutes of remaining drive time. 
[01:38:30]  What?  What do you got?  Some kind of robot driving?  That's a good place.  What is that?  Your navigation system?  It's navigation.  It's electronic log.  Please drive off a cliff.  Do the world a favor.  Electronic log?  That's what robots find in their toilets.  What happened?  Boo.  What happened?  What is she trying to do?  I don't know.  What are you trying to do?  Oh, derails our show. 
[01:39:00]  Madam.  All right.  Well, that was a wonderful phone call.  Thank you.  She jackknifed our show.  That's what happens.  We're trying to keep the shiny side up and the dirty side down.  Good buddy.  Is that what they say?  Oh, yeah.  Keep your foot to the floor.  Shining side up and the dirty side down.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves.  How about this?  Go as fast as you can, you fucking cranked out zilch. 
[01:39:30]  Fucking drive faster, meth addict.  That should be trucker expression.  Fix your mud flap, cunt.  We might have a new video from the dude from the Newfie.  Remember this guy?  Of course.  Forget him.  He's calling us, what, bootlickers and lizards and...  Shitheads.  Shitheads.  Something like that.  He's accusing us of giving him Tourette's. 
[01:40:00]  What?  Is there a new video by this guy?  I'm looking.  What kind of Tourette's?  I don't know.  It's just plain.  Goofy.  Is there a new video by the guy here?  Wow.  I swear.  I do have an eyeball headache.  I got eyeball headache right now.  Here we go.  What do you mean?  Is this a new one?  Yeah.  Oh.  Turn it towards me, Travis.  Mr. Anderson. 
[01:40:30]  Oh my God.  He dressed in a suit for this one.  Oh, he's ripping me off.  Of course, he's wearing beige, too.  Holy fuck.  Beige.  I love him.  Are we ready to do this?  Who is beige?  I move it back.  Here we go.  Do we have to explain this guy?  Jerk off.  An asshole.  Expert explained.  Jesse Ventura, Chris Kyle.  Controversy that continues because Chris Kyle's still saying he punched out Jesse Ventura.  Jesse Ventura's denying it.  He's a Jesse fanboy who hates us now because we make fun of Jesse.  And we've embraced this hater. 
[01:41:00]  Because there's something about him that we just enjoy.  He's just, the way he says shitheads.  He's utterly valueless.  As he say shitheads.  Opie and Anthony, these shitheads.  Yeah, he's got some kind of a Scottish, Canadian accent.  The description for this video is four paragraphs.  What's the description?  Let's just play it.  He's a terrible boar.  Opie and Anthony came to rest is the name of this video.  Oh, what's he doing now?  Yeah.  These are vultures and they will feed off the most helpless of society. 
[01:41:30]  That's what the Opie and Anthony does.  If they were in the military, they would be put up in the front line with no bullets just to get rid of them.  That's how useless these people are.  Pause that for a second.  It's probably going to be a bit of parge.  And that's not uncomfortable at all.  When I'm here, ten seconds in, I use an analogy about them being shot and murdered.  That's not uncomfortable for anybody to hear.  That's good.  This is how old wackos are.  We write things that kind of foretell what we're going to do.  We'll keep this for the old pistol license renewal. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's how useless these people are.  Okay.  There's probably going to be a bit of parge language in this one, folks.  Because after about nine hours of watching the Don't Be Any Nagy Show, I got fucking turrets.  Nine hours?  I could never get rid of it.  That was unbelievable.  I watched like five hours of these guys, and life became meaningless and hopeless immediately.  Right.  It shows everything.  Pain and everything. 
[01:42:30]  That was beautiful.  I mean, I despised it.  That's power of radio, folks.  Incredible.  You know, that's why I had, like, there was a video I put up earlier today of a good friend  of mine, and I had some friends by, and we were playing guitar and singing, and I done  it on purpose because I had to get away from this hopey and dopey routine and that human  fucking waste of Jim Norton.  Yay!  What the fuck is that to me?  Finally.  Finally.  Jim Norton, you know, he's kind of like, if I was asked to describe that guy, I would 
[01:43:00]  put him down as a vegetable that got eyes and a mouth, and somehow manages to dress  himself every fucking day.  Yeah.  Most likely it's in the most soiled clothes he could find from last week.  Point that, please.  I didn't, I didn't say a lot of stuff, but I don't realize he's a sweater boy cutie.  Yes.  I don't realize he's...  Look at your sweater boy cutie.  Look at...  Don't give me that.  Sitting with Opian, and Opian Duncy, and sweater boy cutie.  He's got his clean t-shirt and his new cologne, and he's wearing his nice boxers, and he's got 
[01:43:30]  a gentleman's coat, a gentleman's coat, keeping it warm on those cold New York mornings.  That waste of space.  Oh, fuck.  It's like a vegetable.  A vegetable with eyes.  With eyes.  And a mouth.  And a mouth.  A mouth.  So he must have hands.  I don't know why I just said eyes.  How could he dress himself with eyes?  With eyes.  You could undress someone with your eyes.  You can't dress him with your eyes. 
[01:44:00]  I undress Jesse Ventura when I see him.  Damn your eyes, man.  Damn your eyes.  He's like a Daniel Day-Lewis.  It's just a left foot with eyes.  A vegetable with a left foot.  No hands.  Just eyes.  And a left foot creeping around.  He loves the attention, though, because he's got his best suit on.  Of course he does.  He knows people are not watching this video.  I'm wearing a sharkskin suit.  All right.  Please, Moore.  I'm pretty sure it's too stupid to use a washing machine.  Unless a condom comes out of it, you probably can't figure out how to use it. 
[01:44:30]  You know?  That's how stupid these people are.  I don't know how the fuck they can manage to feed themselves or even tie their own shoelaces  every day.  It's hard.  Sometimes I eat my shoelaces.  Oh, this guy's coming up with great things of how dumb we are.  Yeah.  Hey, these guys probably can't even find a hat.  I'll bet you guys, I'm surprised they can't even make their own toast and put marmalade on  it in the morning.  How many examples are you going to give?  I'm going to give a whole bunch of examples of just things.  I bet they can't even pull back their bedspread when there's a fire next door.  How do they turn their darn up? 
[01:45:00]  How do you turn your fucking darn up to leave your house?  I'm just sitting here with my chair keeping all the sunlight out so it doesn't wreck the  production value.  I've gotten a bigger blanket to put over my window.  Underneath this blanket's a lot of clear pre-seminal fluid that I get when I'm watching Jesse  Ventura talking.  I put it over my lap like an Afghan.  I bet they can't even squeeze the toothpaste out onto the brooch. 
[01:45:30]  The brooch is sitting there and the toothpaste is all over the sink.  I bet if a lima bean fell they couldn't even kick it into a cup like a little golf ball.  I bet if a lima bean fell they couldn't even scoop it up with a lima bean scooping apparatus.  They walk around in the dark because they can't even flick a light switch.  It's impossible to fucking retards.  I don't know how these guys even comb their hair.  They're probably too stupid to pick up a comb and rather throw their hair over their eyeballs. 
[01:46:00]  Nonetheless, use a Q-tap.  Probably can't even use a fucking Q-tap.  These guys are just worthless opian duncy.  Opian and turd hattie.  Turd hattie.  They're probably too stupid.  Choice a hat with Jimmy.  Probably too stupid to even mix up tea with a tea mixing apparatus.  They probably go cream and sugar and just have it black because they don't know how to put in cream or sugar.  They don't even know how to use their cups at home.  They probably just pour their coffee into their hands and scoop it up towards their mouth. 
[01:46:30]  And just hope for their best.  Get their eyes all and they're too dumb to go to the emergency room.  Oh, be an incredible shithead.  And this human pile of marmalade, Jim Norton.  I'm going to name food.  And this strip steak with eyes and teeth, Jim Norton.  And this piece of sweet potato pie with herpes, Jim Norton.  We have seven minutes left.  Oh, goody. 
[01:47:00]  Also learning that he's from southern England.  Thank you, JD.  Is that where he is now?  Southern England.  And he has a Twitter that we'll get into in a little bit.  Oh, good.  But back to the latest video from this guy that really hates us.  Good.  See what I mean?  I got turrets, literally, from listening to Opie and Abney for about nine hours.  At one point, dear, I almost beat my dog to death.  I was like, shut up, dog, and I'm going to kill you.  That's what I called my wife.  And I've never said that to my dog in my life.  I called my wife a dog.  I was beating my dog to death. 
[01:47:30]  I was punching it right on the back hindquarters with both fists as my genitals were buried in his little backside.  He was yelping for help and clawing at the window, but he couldn't find it because I have a curtain.  I was trying to watch the soccer game, and I had a nice steak out there in my door.  All right, all right.  So I kicked him in the fucking lever.  I kicked him in the fucking lever, and he keeled over, dearie dead.  That's what I wish would happen to Opie and the shite head. 
[01:48:00]  His little Jack Russell tail was flapping against me appendix scar as I punched his little hindquarters and held him with those little corn-on-the-cob things.  It was quite the Donnybrook.  I drove my erection deep into his little barking, yelping buttocks, and I showed him who was boss.  I'm wearing a shirt that's a collar that's a little too big for me.  Apparently, I've dropped a few pounds.  Do a nice big collar for 1977.  Ah, look at his lapels.  Yes.  Yeah.  I've got my Tony Manero jacket on. 
[01:48:30]  I could get into any discotheque.  Please, more.  At one point there, I almost beat my dog to death.  I was like, shut up, dog, or I'm going to kill you.  Terrible informer.  I've never said that to my dog in my life.  But after listening to these subhumans, these anti-humans, these men, these are these fickle.  I'm going to start writing things down because I run out after two. 
[01:49:00]  These subhumans, these anti-humans.  Oh, no, I'm going with the humans team.  I can't think of a turd thing.  Oh, he stinks.  These human growth hormones.  Human.  These human league songs.  Human society.  Yeah.  Stay on the road.  Stay off the moors.  These humans.  These humans.  Delicious deli snacks. 
[01:49:30]  The human fund.  These human rights violations.  To these subhumans, these anti-humans, these men.  These are despicable.  I'm going to look down at what I've written, but try not to keep my eyes down so it doesn't look like I'm reading.  Because I'm too stupid to realize if you hold it at camera level, your eyes are in the place they should be.  So I'm going to leave it on me desk and just peruse what I've written while you're all staring at me eyelids. 
[01:50:00]  Because I'm a dumbbell.  I'm a dumbbell with a giant shirt collar.  Ah, the lapels are huge.  If I jump out of a 40th floor window, I'll float to safety.  These are despicable.  Yes.  Yeah.  You know, if you immerse yourself into that darkness, this cult of opium and acne, it's like walking in a sewer for something you don't want and you can't use. 
[01:50:30]  These vultures, these anti-human parasites, they're out there feeding on your loved ones and getting them to feed on them.  That's what they're all about.  Picking on the most vulnerable in society.  These people are cowards.  Yes, Paul.  Because Jesse Ventura is very vulnerable.  They were picking on the poor, weak, ex-Navy SEAL, ex-governor, ex-wrestler.  They really pick on the weakest of the weak.  What's next?  Chuck Liddell?  Who else are they going to pick on?  Another week. 
[01:51:00]  Perhaps who?  Who?  George Furman?  Other people that can't defend themselves.  What are they going to do next?  Go poke Lennox Lewis in the eyes?  Are they going to kick Ronaldo, the soccer player, in his genitals?  His uncircumcised genitals?  They're picking on all these defenseless people.  Like, just even try the poor lad.  Don't you know?  Getting them to feed on them.  That's what they're all about.  Picking on the most vulnerable in society. 
[01:51:30]  These people are cowards.  Like, if they were in Iraq, they'd be hanging from a crane, okay?  Or they'd be the towel boys at the local men's bat house.  That's about it.  Bat house?  A bat house?  These people are parasites.  You know how insects will lie in the desert for months, hid, buried in the sand, waiting  for life to come in.  They'll come in and they'll leech after that in order to survive.  That's why they're opening at me, that human wreck.  Bugs in the desert.  These people are butt flies.  They land under your skin and they hatch while you're talking to your friends. 
[01:52:00]  It's amazing.  They're like centipedes.  Just moseying around with a bunch of legs.  Make no sense, guy.  Human centipedes.  They've got one head in the asshole and another head in their asshole.  And they're just eating shit and swallowing it.  They're feeding their listeners shot.  The shot that comes out of them.  Like a human centipede.  That virtual stank bugs.  These people are giant hornets.  They just fly around picking on bumblebees. 
[01:52:30]  Jim, nothing, Norton are like.  That's how you describe these people in reality.  The only rational thing that ever came out of their mouth was they supported Ron Paul.  And I said to myself, well, gee, you know, maybe they've got a bit of rationality left  in them somewhere.  But then, you know, I had time to think about this, especially yesterday when we were sitting  around singing and having a really nice time here.  I came to the realization all of a sudden, that's frightening. 
[01:53:00]  That's friggin' frightening.  Frightening.  That's frightening that Obi and Anthony and Jim, nothing nor, are supporting Ron Paul.  That means all those fucking lunatics that are licking their boots all the time might  show up at a Ron Paul rally.  And that could be used to demonize Ron Paul supporters.  And that's what's happening, probably.  Way to take lemonade and make lemons.  I won't want Paul to win. 
[01:53:30]  But I don't want anybody supporting him.  Only me and my singing friends.  Hey.  You're having a little sing-off.  I don't want them back and run, Paul.  I want to, when we're singing, just me, just me bandmates.  Hey, the rocker arm assembly, assembly, assembly.  The rocker arm assembly.  We don't like dirt.  That was an old mobile commercial.  I couldn't believe, I couldn't believe when a late singer called me a toonin' son of a bitch. 
[01:54:00]  And pushed me out of his house.  I couldn't believe it.  Get the fuck out.  Get the fuck out, my house.  My girlfriend and the retard were watching, and we were all just playing.  Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga.  And even the retard said it sounds like a number one hit tune.  Although that was the faggot.  The faggot was whispering through the whole movie.  The poof-ter was talking to the retard.  Yeah, we were just sitting around singing, eating meat that was a little loud and spoiled. 
[01:54:30]  Dancing without using our hands.  Where's the Tourette's?  Ron Paul supporters.  And that's what's happening, probably.  They're being co-opted.  These lunatic, these fringe crazies that wouldn't even exist.  Only that they feel on par with this kind of smut that comes out of the opium agony show.  Think about the things they say.  They had this one guy there, he wants to kill his wife, right?  And the boys were saying, you know, just masturbate and pretend you're choking the living shit out of her and stuff like that. 
[01:55:00]  Do it over, right?  It's so revolting, I can't even.  That's a dumb.  Why would you do that when you could just really choke her?  Why pretend you're killing her when you could just kill her?  See, they don't want to go to the extra mile.  Yeah, they want to pretend they're doing things instead of really living.  You don't know what it's like until you're coming and someone breathes a lot of breath in your face.  Just choke the cunt.  Just choke her with a wire hanger. 
[01:55:30]  Give her the old janiola as you're ejaculating into her shitting anus.  They always shit when they're dying.  It's the body getting rid of all the excrement.  You don't know living until you put on a bad suit.  That's why I have me windows blocked, so nobody can see them clawing for their lives.  Then you're choking the living shit out of her and stuff like that.  Do what I do, right?  It's so revolting, I can't even repeat it.  They should be locked up in a mental institution and be pumped up with some kind of drug for at least 10 years 
[01:56:00]  and then put them through school again and teach them to be a part of society.  They have no benefit to anybody out there, only evil people and hate.  This is what they propagate.  And they encourage their listeners to bash women and bash their children, basically,  with the mentality that they put out that life is not precious.  Life is not cool.  Life is not worth living. 
[01:56:30]  It's this despicable look at ourselves is what it really is.  And they make money off this and they justify that as a distraction in some way.  They call that humor for some reason.  I make a few pines.  That's the guys they put it on.  Like it's actually, like they're actually part of the human race.  These people are not part of the human race.  These are anti-human parasites who are feeding off the human race.  Pause.  I make a seven-minute video that should probably be a minute and 15 seconds 
[01:57:00]  because I tend to be redundant and say the same words.  Because you're looking to edit it.  I should really pick up a thesaurus and see what a synonym for parasite might be.  Parasite.  Maybe just go and call them a musketo.  They're like a bunch of musketos.  These damn bedbugs.  They're like tex.  Or fleas or tex or musketos.  I keep saying the same bug over and over.  Whatever kind of blood-soaking creature you can think of. 
[01:57:30]  That's what they are.  Yeah, I probably should have cut this down to about a minute and 15 seconds.  But I just got, because what happens is I have a bunch of stuff written,  but I panic and I don't want to loop down for too long.  So I take a quick glance and I realize I can't read my psychopath scribblings  because I'm writing in child's blood.  So I say parasite again and again and again.  These are aliens literally figuratively.  These are vultures.  Literally figuratively.  Okay.  They're so vicious at this stage right now. 
[01:58:00]  They're coming after me because I'm in a wheelchair.  That's incredible.  Pause.  That thing.  Oh, boy.  Was it a wheelchair?  Oh, boy.  We had no idea.  I had no idea.  Oh, boy.  Jim Norton doesn't know how brilliant his analogy from Sling Blade really was.  I wish I had known you were in a wheelchair.  I'd have done tipping you over jokes for two days now.  You bag of shite.  I had no idea your legs were as awful as your videos. 
[01:58:30]  Who knew he was in a wheelchair?  They're making fun of me turnip legs.  My potato blight legs.  They're making fun of the fact I've been wearing the same pair of shoes since 1987.  Not a scuff to be found.  Mary, a scratch on the soles.  Oh, I had no idea.  Like, I'm Perry Mason.  I'm Perry Mason.  I didn't...  Jim is now excited because he didn't know when he compared you to the Sling Blade guy 
[01:59:00]  that he was 100% spot on.  Why would you offer that up?  Oh, that's not going to end good.  I'm trying to make myself look like a victim, but all I've done is added a lot of fodder  onto the...  Oh, boy, Adam.  ...onto the making fun of me.  Nice legs, Dick.  People are begging for his Twitter, and I think we got it.  At the end of this video.  Go ahead.  Continue.  Days right now, they're coming after me because I'm in a wheelchair.  That's incredible.  That they singled that out as a reason to attack me and a way to attack me. 
[01:59:30]  I couldn't even know.  My goodness.  Spoken like a true psychopath.  I attack them.  They've never heard of me.  They respond, and I play the victim.  I'm like every girl Jim Norton tries to fuck.  That's what I do.  I attack them.  I go on the attack.  I put up a video, and they respond.  And what do I do?  I am in a wheelchair.  My legs are no good.  Bye.  My useless appendages.  Along with me penis.  Me penis is fucking useless. 
[02:00:00]  They're in a way to attack me.  My goodness.  What kind of world do we live into when that's what you're grasping at?  That's that straw that you grasp at.  No, that straw is your spoiler.  Because I'm in a hospital bed for the last 12 years.  It's like a crazy straw it is.  Full of spinal fluid, flipping through it like a crazy straw.  Like one of those bendable ones you put in a drink.  He was in a hospital bed for 12 years. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, boy.  12 years?  I don't care.  Why do you think?  In a hospital bed for 12 years?  Maybe spinal meningitis.  Some type of parasite.  Maybe a victim of the war.  Which one?  I don't know.  The Folklins.  Let's find out.  It's because I'm in a hospital bed for the last 12 years.  Because I worked for a fucking living.  That's right.  I worked for a living.  Yeah.  And that's how I ended up in a hospital bed for over a decade.  In a wheelchair.  Where I didn't go into. 
[02:01:00]  And I guess I shouldn't have gone into the hospital bed testing business.  That was my job.  I was a hospital bed tester.  And I wish I hadn't done that.  But I changed my job.  No, I'm a wheelchair tester.  There's nothing more repulsive than somebody who goes on the attack and gets attacked back and then plays the victim.  There's nothing more annoying than that.  And if I think that by talking about my wheelchair I'm going to stop them from making fun of me.  Oh, am I sadly mistaken.  If I call them parasites, they're going to tease my twig legs. 
[02:01:30]  Little bed for over a decade in a wheelchair where I didn't go into the bowels of hells like these guys.  I went and educated myself and tried to make the world a little bit better.  What else were you going to do?  That's what I don't.  I tried to still contribute to society.  All you contributed was what was in the bedpan.  They absolutely hate everything you do.  I said here, take this, give this out to the huddled masses.  And it was my duty and my urine. 
[02:02:00]  I was crapping in a pot.  Crapping in a pot.  And the nurse came by and I said, I'm producing something.  I hurt myself at work.  I was the van driver in a child pornography ring.  And I bumped into a curb looking at a young fella's buttocks.  Just trying to do some good.  He says we hate him.  We don't even know you.  I had no idea he was in a wheelchair.  Right.  Because he's sitting in a chair.  We don't know you, sir. 
[02:02:30]  But this to me, it's amazing how somebody will attack us that we've never heard of.  We attack back and this baby boy plays the victim.  Like, what a jerk off.  There's no rules if you're attacking someone, right?  I don't care you're in a wheelchair.  Go fuck yourself.  I didn't attack you first.  I never heard of you.  Yeah, we would have never known about you.  You didn't like what we said about Jesse Ventura.  You put a boring video out.  But we smashed you and now you're rubbing your little tears like you're a victim. 
[02:03:00]  We never heard of you.  Go ahead.  They chucked my wheels.  I couldn't move.  They cut farts in my face.  All I could do is wave them.  I couldn't even walk away.  All it takes is four blackboard erasers and I can't move.  And they hate me for that.  They absolutely hate everything good.  This is how they live.  And he's good.  Their darkness.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  You know, they can't be good darkness and take a whole bunch of those lemmings and jump off a cliff.  Maybe put that up on YouTube.  Cliff?  I don't know what a cliff is.  Cliff?  No.  No, they've got to destroy everything good out there.  And they go out and they just, they create this tabloid effect.  That's how they get their name out there.  And they artificially inflate the views and the ratings and the comments and favorites.  Artificially inflate like my tires.  And subscriptions.  It's all right. 
[02:04:00]  I wish other things like my pant legs could be artificially inflated to help me stand for a couple of minutes.  But I do sound like the kind of guy who will show up with a rifle and a hunting hat.  Yes.  Everybody is relieved I'm in a wheelchair.  No kidding.  Because no matter how good a shot I am, I can't roll at them down the street.  How come no one I know will oil me wheels?  Yes.  I always heard the squeaky wheels get the grease. 
[02:04:30]  The ratings and the comments and the favorites and the subscriptions.  It's all artificial.  These guys are fake 100%.  They're hoping someone will come along and rescue them and bring them into a real comedy act.  It ain't never going to happen.  Vaudeville.  Right?  They live a disorganized life.  They appeal to people that can't listen to a single voice.  They have to have all this background noise in order for them to be able to focus in on little things. 
[02:05:00]  Because they need all that distraction.  They don't want their mind to fucking think about what the person is saying.  They can just float off into the distractions.  They come after me because I'm in a wheelchair, and they know nothing about why I'm in a wheelchair.  All right.  Just wanted that to explain.  It's because I spent 128 days on the ocean as a commercial diver, six hours a day on the ocean floor.  I got the bins.  And I woke up in a wheelchair.  You attack my mother constantly.  That's pretty surprising. 
[02:05:30]  Pause.  Whoa.  Okay.  Now he's really getting into loony zone.  Oh, we got a psychopath.  Wonderful.  They talk to me when I'm not even listening to the radio.  Oh, boy.  I have to put tin file over me head.  Let the record state we don't know you, sir.  We don't know anything about you.  Don't talk about me, mum.  I have.  Maybe that was a comment somebody made on one of your dumb videos, but we don't know shit about you.  Aye.  Whoa.  We got a fucking psycho.  But, again, this is why I just, to tell, me, me, me, me, oh, me legs, oh, me diving, oh, me victimization. 
[02:06:00]  Aye.  Yes.  Me legs.  Aye.  They were nibbled off by the Loch Ness Monster.  I was a diver.  Oh, he was a diver, yeah.  I was a diver.  Aye.  Listen, Lee, that's pretty surprising, isn't it, for you guys?  I had to fly across Canada to take her off race. 
[02:06:30]  And me arms are killing me.  I'm a diver, and that's how I hurt my legs.  There was no water in the pool.  And I clunked my head in my bad suit jacket.  Well, you know, they found me, actually, in the middle of the burnt woods.  The woods was all burnt.  I was in me wetsuit and laying there.  And they found me, and I was paralyzed.  Apparently, a big plane that gets the water picked it up and threw me on the fucking fire.  Now we're here. 
[02:07:00]  Now you're making fun of me mother and father and me aunt and uncle Paul.  Now we're here, and he's from Canada.  Oh, Canada.  I thought we learned he was from southern England.  Where the fuck is this guy from?  No, he's from Canada.  All his old videos are him with the Canadian flag behind him talking about being from Canada.  And someone's got a, well, then I think we got the wrong Twitter account.  The information you're getting is he had some artist on the front of his page that was from England.  So they thought that was the guy who was doing all the stuff.  Oh, he could give a floyan fuck where the hell this guy's from.  Yes. 
[02:07:30]  We're giving him 20 different fucking accents.  He's everything from a Liverpoolian to an Aussie.  Well, I just felt safer knowing he was in southern England.  There I was.  Canada's a little closer.  Oh, I was in a wheelchair.  I don't know what happened.  You could take a bus from Canada.  The radiator's cracked at the core.  Guys, I had to fly across Canada and take her off life support, by the way, a couple of years back. 
[02:08:00]  She wasn't on life support.  You think nothing of that.  You think that's intelligence or something.  That's smart.  What?  What?  I don't know how I think Opie and Anthony and Jim Martin know this about me, considering I'm an anonymous idiot from Canada.  They've never heard of me, and yet I think they know the intimate details of my life.  I'm a crazy fuck.  I'm a self-obsessed fuck, and I think other people know all about me. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah?  Yeah?  Like me mother?  She was on the life support.  I had to go up and disconnect it.  I should have just called.  Hey, could you pull the plug?  Logically, why would I think anybody knew that, considering they never heard of me until I attacked them?  Oh, that's right.  I'm a fucking whack job, and I'm a victim, like all whack.  Me, me, me, me, me, me.  I just like to say me.  Everybody notices me.  Sometimes the radiator says me name. 
[02:09:00]  Sometimes the president talks about me in his speeches.  Fuck.  We didn't know you were in a wheelchair, and we didn't say shit about your mom.  I don't know or care about anything about this guy's life.  You're not the only one.  Self-centered.  All right, hit it.  Almost done.  Man.  Yo, can't.  You should take that second amendment you got, put that fucking gun in your mouth, and pull the triggers.  Do the world a real big favor, because you're destroying people.  That's what you do. 
[02:09:30]  You destroy everything.  That's the second bullet reference during this.  Exactly.  This is exactly what happens with crazy people.  We go on ranch before we commit murders, and we don't say we're going to commit a murder.  We talk about suicide, and we use bullet-like analogies.  Why don't you guys take the bullet train?  Although I did say that we're destroyers, much like Lou Grant called Opia, a destroyer.  I can't stand these guys, and yet I watched nine hours of them. 
[02:10:00]  Why?  Because I'm a sick fucking person.  Fucking obsessed.  It took them nine hours to figure out what we're all about.  That's a wow sticker on my wheelchair.  Wouldn't ten minutes do that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nine hours.  That's sick.  No one listens for nine hours.  My legs were killing O-8.  O.  I had to get up and stretch my O.  O.  That's what I keep looking down for, just to make sure they're not hanging all willy-nilly.  Looks like Jarge's legs from Otto and Jarge. 
[02:10:30]  They're just swinging around.  Me shoes are not even touching the carpet.  I'm like the guy from Clockwork Orange.  I hear Alex singing.  I'm singing in the rain in the bathtub, and I go crazy.  You probably had to listen for nine hours because someone turned it on for him and then left the house.  They put a stick in me spokes.  I can't get up to the radio.  Who's Fred Sheckler?  Oh, fuck.  That's what you do.  You destroy everything good.  Yep.  And you teach people to hate everything good. 
[02:11:00]  Aye.  Aye.  You create violent extremists that will go out and target people because you're electoral.  You're anti-human fucking scum.  Wow, who does he look at at the end of that?  Not the shoe salesman.  I hated married with children.  It was just rubbing me nose in it.  He was making fun of me is what he was doing. 
[02:11:30]  I see that.  They measure people's fate for new shoes.  Never me.  They never ask.  When you're in a wheelchair, you're supposed to be able to say what you want about people without a harsh response.  Me.  And when they respond, you can just point out that you're in a wheelchair and be seen as a victim all over again.  Aye.  You got one of his music videos?  Oh, please.  Please, John.  He said he had to make a music video just to relax a little bit.  I had legs. 
[02:12:00]  Now I can't use them.  Jimmy spit his laugh.  Jimmy spit his laugh.  Jimmy spit his laugh.  Wow.  These boots are made for rolling 
[02:12:30]  And that's just what they'll do  Nothing beats a great pair of legs  I guess a seat warmer  I'm sitting  Yes indeed I'm sitting  I want to communicate  Give me my city talkie  Roll like a man

[02:21:00]  It's absolutely one  Of my favorites  Wow  In your top 5  No but it's probably  My top 10  It's uh  I can't put it with  The Godfather  Or Cuckoo's Nest  Or Raging Bull  That's true  Or films like that  That I've loved for 25 years  How great is Cuckoo's Nest  It's probably my favorite movie  Every time I throw that in  Which is once every  4 or 5 years  I'm like holy fuck  This movie's amazing  So you're trying to get  A picture with him  Oh my god  I just  I wish I had my Crash here  But I didn't know who he was in  He looks so famous  He's  We see celebrities all the time  But there are 
[02:21:30]  There are some  That you just go  Holy fuck  That guy's famous  I won  What else has Terrence been in  He was in  Refresh my memory  He won the Oscar  For Hustle and Flow  Right  He was in the first Iron Man  Right  Um  And uh  Obviously Crash  He should've won the Oscar for  And now he's Red Tails  That's uh  George Lucas's new movie  How is he  About the Tuskegee Airmen  And how they uh  Even back in the  The 40's  Used uh  Black lingo and dialect  Oh Jimmy  That we hear today 
[02:22:00]  In uh  Black culture  Is that right  It's amazing  How they uh  How we're doing that  Even back then  In the 40's  When they would um  You know  Go on a strafing run  And uh  Or a bombing run  And blow something up  That the pilot would yell out  Yeah take that Mr. Hitler  You know  Just doesn't seem  Quite the same  Historic  Jimmy just left  He got the call  To get his picture  With Terrence Howard  And I also saw  Jimmy working the publicist  Saying look  Alright  We want to interview you 
[02:22:30]  Alright  And we'll be cool  Alright  So you should come down the hall  And uh  Do the Opie and Anthony show  So let's see if uh  Jimmy has that type of pull  Uh  But right now he's getting his picture  I hope not  George Lucas uh  Came out with a little controversy  About Red Tails  Oh yeah he did  Happen to have the clip right here  So I mean  We might as well go with it  He said uh  Something yeah  He said this  How long have you been working on this  23 years  23 years  We finished it  Uh  Financed it myself 
[02:23:00]  And I figured I could  You know  Get the prints and ads  Uh  Paid for by the studios  And that they would release it  Right  And I showed it to all of them  And they said  No  We don't know how to  Market a movie like this  Why  It's not green enough  Really  They only  They only release green movies  I didn't realize that  So the message  Because  Because the message  Is patriotic and jingoistic  And doesn't have any  Recycling in it  That's the problem  No  It's because  It's because  It's an all black movie  There's no  Major white roles in it at all  It's one of the first 
[02:23:30]  It's one of the first  All black  Action pictures ever made  Really  Is that true  Yeah  Now I  Oh bad boys  No I meant  Thumbs up on the interview  I knew he was getting his picture  I go to Sam  Thumbs up  And Sam goes  Two thumbs up  And thinking  Holy fuck  We're going to have  Terrence Howard on our show  Because he got two pictures  No  Well we're not getting the interview  Because I just saw  Jimmy Walk back by himself  Yeah no no  We're not getting an interview  Fuck  Why  He's got a nice suit on though  Does he want to promote his here 
[02:24:00]  He might as well  Why no to the interview you think  Because we're a white show  Who  I don't even know if we tried to get him  Oh  I just told the world  You were trying  I didn't ask if any of you know  Because he was  He's got things to do  I  The flash wouldn't work  I was panicking  I heard you talk to the publicist  Say look  We'll show him nothing  Oh next time  Not today  I said for next time he's in  No he's along  Catch a train  Oh okay  But he uh  The flash didn't work  What  Uh oh  Oh that's bad  When you're having a picture  With a  Why next time  He's here now  Cause he's 
[02:24:30]  Well you know  I get it  Contrast  Pigmentation  You think that's  I've seen some pics like that  Yeah the flash didn't work  Let me see  Kenny tried to  I picked a picture with him  Good luck in Photoshop  What do you mean  You're  You're all about the flash working  I think I have it on auto  I bet you I have it on auto  I'm such a faggot  Use the lasso tool  Because you're not going to want to  Light up the rest of the picture  We should have Jonathan  Yeah have him come in  And Vaughn come in  But I want to see your picture  Okay  Where's my flash settings  No I want to see the picture  You can worry about the flash settings  Why didn't 
[02:25:00]  The flash go off  Oh boy  That's it  I bet you Kenny didn't hold it down right  Probably didn't  Kenny did you  Did you fuck up  The Terrence Howard picture  It is very light  In that hallway  He was standing under two lights  It's a good picture  Yeah  Oh you didn't need the flash  No okay  Oh he's dressed to the nines  Motherfucker  Yeah he's dressed  Show up  He dresses rich  That's a good  That's a good picture right there  Who cares about the flash  It's a good pic 
[02:25:30]  Oh you don't need the flash  Okay  No  I just  I'm so used to  By the way  I don't think he won the academy award  Someone's saying  I said  He won for hustle and flow  What does this delete button do  No Gregorio  Oh look  It just says delete  Oh you gave him the camera Jimmy  If I just touch the screen  Look at him  He's really freaking  Because I don't think  First of all  Don't get too close to it  The heat from your pig  Oh man  I'll tell you what almost happened  I wouldn't delete  That would be hell on earth for me  Why would I do that to myself  Oh my god  But I almost did touch the screen 
[02:26:00]  And that's all it would take  And it says delete  Oh boy  Give him back the camera  That's a good shot  Fuck it up  Oh fuck  I don't think he wanted to  He's adorable  He didn't want to take the picture  No he was okay  What  You don't think I need  I don't need a flash  So you're right  I over flashed  You might need the flash  WTF  Yeah maybe I do  Yeah just say you need  Just tell him he needs the flash  It's a beautiful photo  It is a great photo  You can touch it up in Photoshop  It's not blurry  Now everyone knows our health  He's gonna like debate 
[02:26:30]  In his own head  Whether or not he needed that flash  Terrence Howard does not have an Oscar  No  That's the information  That's coming  Well  Philip Seymour Hoffman won for Capote  And Jimmy Norton is trying to make it like he just got a picture with an Oscar winner  When in fact he did not  Didn't he win for Hustle and Flow  He should have  I thought he should have won  No I thought he  You just don't like him because he's black  Well  I thought he should have won  Probably didn't win because he's black  It's very hard to fit in that like category 
[02:27:00]  They only have a few Oscars they put aside for the blacks  Well he's light skinned black  Like me  That is true yeah  Yeah  Oh you're barely black  Yeah I saw your mama  I know  Your mama is not even close to black  You're actually lighter than a lot of people around here  Yeah  Especially me  I'm lighter than most white people  You might even be  My great great grandmother  When the Moors  Invade  But Vaughn might even be whiter than her white mama  I think I am  Which is kind of creepy  I think I am  The Moors  Yeah  The Moors  Not whiter than Jonathan though 
[02:27:30]  The Moors  You know Philip Seymour Hoffman was in that Moneyball  And didn't talk the whole movie  Really  How do you do that  What a waste  It's kind of a waste  I only talk but slightly  Not much  Not much  Wouldn't you have him talk more if you have Philip Seymour Hoffman in your movie  Yeah  Did you like Moneyball  Yeah I did actually  I just saw it  I thought it was a waste of time  Really  Yeah I don't want to learn about the 2002 Oakland A's  Who cares  I didn't know anything about it  So when I saw it  I thought I watched it on the plane  You know why you didn't know anything about it  And in the end they lost  Who cares  You don't want to know anything about the A's 
[02:28:00]  You don't want to learn about the 2002 A's  Who cares  Because in the end they didn't win  I know  I know they changed  I didn't know that watching it  So for me it was  I thought they were actually going to win the World Series  No the whole time I'm thinking to myself  Why am I watching this  I know the A's didn't win that year  Because you know the outcome  Yeah I didn't know the outcome  See that's good because you know  Imagine like you know  I went into the movie  And I knew every play  Everything that was going to happen  This is how stupid I am  Wasn't very much fun for me  Watching the game  I thought the movie was about like  The turn of the century A's  I had no idea 
[02:28:30]  Shoes Joe Jackson  Something like that  And then I went  Oh my god  This is about the 2002 A's  But then I was vested by that point  I said alright I'll watch  Yeah  Yeah  Jonathan how are you  I'm fine  It's good to be back  Well  Yeah  When I last spoke to you guys  Yeah your phone crapped out  And we didn't know  I'm sorry  Yeah no  You were going to be taken out  I was in the road that took  It was a hundred miles long  And it took seven and a half hours  To get  Oh Jesus  Traffic  For the people that don't know me 
[02:29:00]  They're just turning in  Yeah  Elephants  This is Jimmy's manager Jonathan  Who loves to put himself in danger  Last time we talked to him  He was on the phone from West Africa  Yeah from the Ivory Coast  From the Ivory Coast  Cote d'Ivoire  And you were driving from where to where  From Yamasukuru to Bobo Gelasso  And  That's just like driving from New York to Boston  Right  Yeah yeah exactly  Holy fuck  That wasn't the main destination  The destination actually we were going to  Was Fer Kese Dugu  And 
[02:29:30]  Bless you  Where were you going?  I like that band in the 80s  Fer Kese Dugu  Was the destination we were going  Okay  That was good  I didn't catch it right away  It almost worked  It almost  Give me a pass of grain please  You know  On the way here  We wrote past Rockefeller Center  And he knew  Every one of those flags  Yeah  Oh really  Literally  He was pointing  And that's that  And that's that  You know what though  Since you didn't know them  He could have said anything  No  He knew them  He knew them 
[02:30:00]  There was one in particular  That had a gun on it  Mozambique  And I'm like  Jonathan  I'm pretty sure  If they have a gun  On the flag  You should never go there  Mozambique  That's a sign that  Americans are not welcome  They're gone  Stay away  Fracker  You think you know  Every flag  I think I do actually  Wow  I'm pretty good at it  I knew like  Four or five in school  Flags for a thousand  Alex  A daily double  That would have been good  Well I  The flag for Nepal  Interestingly enough  Is two triangles 
[02:30:30]  It's not even a square  Can we do a quick quiz  With him  I would love to know  If he knows this  Is there a site  I'm sure  I know  But  Douchebags.com  I'm sure you know  Mars is on the computer  Although I am easily impressed  Mars please remember the L  You're forcing us to look at your cleavage today by the way  And then I'm going to feel like a creep  You know I have on my  You are a creep  Yeah but I'm trying not to look at the cleavage  This is a business-y  That is  That's a good business suit  You'll get some deals  That's some business  But then I feel like a creep 
[02:31:00]  Because I keep looking at the cleavage  I'm trying not to look at the cleavage  I'm trying to look at your eyes  Well you're a man  You're supposed to look at cleavage  Are we supposed to look?  My cleavage are better than my eyes  My eyes are really puffy  So  So is your cleavage  I'm mad  No it's not a little  I mean it's there  I don't  It's more than just there  You know Patrice used to always say  I don't know how not to dress like a hoe  Well  But I think this is very  It's nice  If the shirt barely fits  It fits  Hey Sam 
[02:31:30]  Can you help us out?  I like this shirt  I don't want Mars to do a flag test  We want to do a flag test for Jonathan  Okay  Hey wait  He knows the flag for the world  Terrence Howard was Mr. Holland's opus  Was he?  Yeah  You like that movie?  No  Nah  Borefest right?  Well Trifus was in it right?  Not my kind of movie  Yeah I think it was a little rough  I did not like it  It's been many years  I don't  Yeah alright whatever  It means that  But I don't think he won an Oscar  Because it doesn't say anything about it  Maybe you're right  Yeah  I hate the way my fat body looks  When I turn in my sweater  I gotta take head on pictures  Even though I'm a sweater boy cutie 
[02:32:00]  I can't do it from the side  Every photo I've taken in my sweater  I feel like a jerk off  Aw  He's ready to do the flag test  This is multiple choice?  No we don't want multiple choice  He's better than that  Put a piece of paper up over the multiple choice part  Yeah Sam you fucking Peter pumper  We're actually putting pieces of paper up  It's 2012  Flags of the world  You can't just find  Flags of the world  I just want to see how good he is  Let's see  Was there no other way to do that Sam?  That's pretty good  He's holding up a piece of paper  I can't see though right 
[02:32:30]  I can't see right through it  I bet  All right what do you think Jonathan?  You know  Bahamas  All right Bahamas  What's the choices?  Bahamas  And  Just guessing  And  He's right  We'll just do it until he gets one wrong  So far  He's one for one  He's right  All right  What  What flag is that?  Christmas Island  That one's easy  What?  How do you know this?  Christmas  Where's Christmas Island?  That's to the land of misfit toys  Was that right?  All right  It's two for two

[02:33:30]  I was going to say  That's not cool  That's a bed bug  Oh man  It looks itchy  You know this is when you have that moment  I want to say Kenya  But it could be Swaziland  I believe it's  Swaziland  Kenya  All right  He's going to go with Kenya  Oh I hope it's Swaziland  No he's right  He's right  How the fuck do you know this?  This is amazing  Afghanistan  Oh man  He's right  Of course he knows that one  Yeah you know that one  Exactly  That's six for six  Six for six right here  Going to ten  Damn  Look at him go  He's looking  I know that one 
[02:34:00]  It's either Ghana or Cameroon  Could be Senegal  These are where it gets confusing  The African ones  I'm going to go with  I'm going to go with Ghana  It's a green stripe  A yellow stripe  With a green star in it  Next to a red stripe  No it's not Brazil  No I'm going to sit in a  It's going to be Senegal  I think it's Senegal  Senegal or Ghana  Yeah  Which one do you want?  Well Ghana isn't up there right?

[02:37:00]  Which is the biggest TV station  In Afghanistan  And he publishes magazines  And he's got a radio network  A 24-hour news network  And Jim met him  They had dinner in Los Angeles  And he loves Jim  And he asked him  Why don't you write something  Because they have this magazine  Called Afghan Scene Magazine  So Jim wrote an article  Which Saad published  In Afghan Scene Magazine  So I'm now published  In Afghanistan  I couldn't believe they didn't  I thought they must have  Edited it a little bit  It wasn't dirty  No  But it was about  Sexual scandals  In this country  Oh wow 
[02:37:30]  Very nice  And how we have to stop  Judging people  On what they do sexually  Very nice  Wow  That's probably very  Controversial over there  Maybe  How was the Ivory Coast?  Any other stories from there?  Well let's see  I'm trying to think  Of a good story  You were on the back  Of a truck  With guys  No I wasn't  On the back of a truck  I was in a car  That the one thing  They didn't do right  Was plan things properly  Oh what a surprise  The drives were so long  Like changes of power  Wasn't there an uprising 
[02:38:00]  When you went?  No not when I went  It was over  And that's what was  Great about it  Everybody's ready  To move forward now  Oh yeah  The other guy  Who was the former president  Is on trial in The Hague  Right now  And it was fun  It was exciting  It's a cool place  The beaches are amazing there  They really are amazing there  I'll just take you  The north part of the country  Where things were really  Kind of good  You know the day that I left  There was a big warning  From the U.S. government  Saying you know  Avoid all travel 
[02:38:30]  In the Ivory Coast  Americans are urged  Not to travel there  And that doesn't bother you?  Except Jonathan  I didn't know  That had come out  No it doesn't bother me  Actually but  Why?  Well if you listen to them  They'll tell you  Not to go anywhere  I think  I mean you know  They are really  They have to be  I mean look  I understand it  They have to be crazy  Would you go to Mexico right now?  It depends where  Sure  But not like  I wouldn't go to  Juarez  I don't know about that  That's a no  What's a no? 
[02:39:00]  Think about it  It depends  I mean for  You know  I would go to Mexico City  I'd go to  No problem going to Mexico City  You went to Haiti right?

[02:39:30]  That's a problem  But  You don't want to get  Ring around it right?  Oh chill  Do you need more than hand sanitizer for that?  Yeah for cholera  Yeah I don't think some off the shelf hand sanitizer  Fixes cholera  What is a cook put on his hands?  Yeah  You try not to think about that  No you do think about that  You gotta think about all the  That's just it  You're just thinking about that  Yeah  What are you eating like  Open bugs on leaves?  No  In places like that  I will eat  Like 
[02:40:00]  I had a grilled cheese sandwich there  That was really good  And I ate a lot of that  Like because of Uzbekistan  Where I got really really violently sick  And  I mean  It screwed me up mentally  So like  Now when I go to  Like when I was in Africa  My friend's like  Oh you gotta eat this  And we stopped on the side of the road  And I'm like  This is no side of the road  This is not good  And it was a guy  Like he had killed something  And he was cooking it on a grill  Literally on the side of the road  I mean in nowhere  I'll show you a picture  If you want to see  I'll show you a picture  I don't know what it was

[02:53:00]  You will not believe this  When I went there  The um  The surprising thing  The first thing  When you enter the country  Their immigration  You know  And customs  The first thing you have to do there  And this is the only country  I mean I've been  As you know  A lot of crazy places  This is the only country  That had the same  Security set up  That we have  Where you have to take the picture  And put your fingerprint ID  Yeah  I've never seen that  Let alone in an African country  That was  That was interesting  That they had that kind of  Security at the airport  Um  The borders is another story  But yeah 
[02:53:30]  Do they like white people?  Yeah  There's a lot of white people  That live there  A lot  Yeah but do they like them  Do they like  Is there racism like in America?  Or is it  I'm sure  Or is it less?  I think there's more  Black on black tribal  Yeah  Animosity  Yeah  When you walked up  To those four guys with guns  That we had  Saw the picture of  What did you say to them?  Oh  Basically  Hey guys  How you doing?  And then they said  They're like  What do you have in the car?  And we said  Nothing  And then 
[02:54:00]  My friend then started talking  He said  No no no  Tourism  You know  We're here for tourism  And what not  And  What is tourism?  And then they  They were  They were glad  That we were here  And then the guy said  Why don't you get out of the car?  And I said  Were you nervous?  No  Surprisingly I wasn't  I genuinely was not thinking  Like oh  They're going to do something crazy  I thought we were going to have to pay them  And then the one guy  Then I remembered  That I'd bought these cigarettes  And I said  Well here  Have a cigarette  And they all got excited 
[02:54:30]  About the cigarettes  And then  Well that is  Just like cash  It's really weird right?  Well these were the good cigarettes  Like the  You know  The ones that  I mean I don't smoke  But these are I guess  The ones here  Like the Marlboros  Are the real Marlboros  Like so much of what you see  In all over the world  Are either not as good quality  Or they're the fake Marlboros  Oh  If you've got a real Marlboro  Yeah  Wow  Why don't you pitch a show  To the Travel Channel  Or something  You know  This has never been done  These crazy places  I don't think they  I guess

[03:00:00]  Specifically inside the car  Like this  Like it was resting on the door  And the window was down  And the barrel of the  You just slowly roll the window up  Yeah  The barrel's going up  Like maybe  You won't notice  Rolling  And then  And then  And then he was like  No jokes  No nothing  And he  Then  And then finally like  The guy signaled me like  Give him some money  And then I was like  You know like  I had a hand signal for like  You tell Ty Webb  I'm gunning for him  Yeah  How much do you give him? 
[03:00:30]  Wouldn't he want all of it?  At that time I think it was  Yeah  All of it  If you're one of those guys  You'd go no  Give me all of it  No no no  It was like 20,000 Sefa  Which is  It's like a buck  80  No no no  No no no  This was like  Maybe 40 dollars  So how come you didn't  Just take all your money?  I think if  The problem was doing that  Probably pisses off the guy  Down the road  That's going to shake him over  Some more  Yeah  Well  Then I learned a trick  And I said  I'm going to see if this will work  There was a crossing the border  Into a place to experiment  Right 
[03:01:00]  A place called  Burkina Faso  Jedi mind trick  What are you doing?  There's a country called Burkina Faso  And I was crossing the border there  And I said  This guy  Because I didn't have a visa  And the guy goes  Alright we'll give you a visa  He hand wrote it in my passport  Which was pretty cool  And  It's not pretty cool  None of this is cool  And I knew I was going to have to pay this guy  Like a good bribe  And  He was cool  The problem was  I said  This is like  I'm thinking to myself  Maybe this will work 
[03:01:30]  Would you write me a note  So that I can pass through  All the other checkpoints  And not have to pay  And he's like  Sure  So he wrote me this note  And  It  You know  It didn't work  I wouldn't think so  The first checkpoint  You're not 13  Going to the fucking nurse's office  You're trying to pass per place  Where they do clinical circumstances  The first time  I thought it would work  And I got nervous  And then I just said  Ah here  And I handed the guy cash 
[03:02:00]  Yeah more money  You know  And then they let me through  But yeah  Wow that's insane  You've got to hide your cash right  Yeah  Do they shake you down ever  No  Sometimes  I carry it  In like three different places  I have a belt  That has money  You know  In the belt  Oh you don't ever think  To look there  Yeah  Money belt  Well that's the thing  I purposely don't put a lot in there  Like maybe 200 bucks is in there  But then  Ah  You put it in like places like  Grass  Actually  That's what everyone's thinking  Like  Yeah that's what everyone's thinking 
[03:02:30]  You put it in fairly open places  Like  I had this book  And I put it in the book  Literally  Because  It's like they're not going to look at the book necessarily  Where's the belt  Like they'll think of  Or the  You know  Or the shoe  Yeah  Or behind you  I've got this thing  This little like pack that you wear  You should have put it in your hair  And you should have just combed your hair green  See  Your hair was green with envy  Oh  Chip  God  I don't think time something's green  Yeah  Terrible  Wow  You should write a book 
[03:03:00]  You're an adventurer  Yeah you definitely got a few books  Because you got  You got a different take on all this  Modern day adventurer  Yeah  It's been fun  There's some  I met these guys  I had this experience  Where we were  We had the driver  To check something in the car  And we stopped  And there was a bus  On the side of the road  And it was one of those buses  You see like  Where it's packed  Six feet high  Of luggage  You know  On the top  And the bus  Was changing the tire  And these guys  Were going to  They came over  And they started talking to us  They were going to Mauritania 
[03:03:30]  And I'm like  Wow  I've never heard of these places  Mauritania is a very discreet country  It's in West Africa  They still have slavery there  And  How about that  These guys were  Were going to Mauritania  And  I started talking to them  And  At one point  And I was with a friend of mine  Who was from Afghanistan  Of course  And  And  I said  He's from Afghanistan  And  They all kind of  Their faces  Like  Mujahideen  Oh  Like a hero  Yeah 
[03:04:00]  And then  And then  And they're like  No, no, no  No Mujahideen  And then  I'm showing him pictures  On my iPhone  Of stuff  And it's like  All of a sudden  I'm like  What a weird scene  You know  We've got this group of guys  From  You know  That are going  And it takes  Three or four days  To get to Mauritania  From where we were  And I'm thinking  Wow  So like five miles away  It's just a real hard trip  It's  Yeah  And I mean  If it took us  That one road  Took us  Seven and a half hours  It was a hundred miles  They're going like 
[03:04:30]  You know  Three thousand miles  I mean  Wow  Yeah  Has there ever been  A moment  Where you were  In one of these places  And you said to yourself  I really should get home  Uzbekistan  And the only reason  Was because  When I got sick  How sick you were  Did you ever have to  Run for your life  No  Literally  To the bathroom  I don't think so  Uzbekistan  What was the other question  How many languages  Do you know  I can get by  In like three  Basically  Like Spanish  No problem  French  You know  Enough to get by  A little Italian 
[03:05:00]  And English  I would think  You know a little  But I've learned words  In like things like  Like in Indonesia  Like  Like some Bahasa  Which is the language  They speak in Indonesia  Or  Like in Africa  You learn a couple of words  And you know  That's really neat  In Indonesia  Don't they hate it  Or Muslims there right  Don't they hate  Americans and Westerners  No no no  No no no  They don't  They just don't hate Jonathan  He's the largest  Muslim country in the world  Indonesia  I would love to know  What card he has on him  That gets him out 
[03:05:30]  Of a lot of shit  How do they know  Right  Yeah because if  One of us went  To half these places  But I see  I disagree  I think you're right  I think if you went there  You know  You just talk to people  They're nice  They're not  You know  I think it's just  A special white skin  He just  I bet he's not observant  Like as he's walking  Down the street  He bends over  For a piece  For some change  And a poison dart  Slips past his head  He goes a little further  A piano falls  Right behind him  And he's just like  People love you  This is great here  They're constantly 
[03:06:00]  Trying to kill him  But he's extremely lucky  Yeah  Yeah  A guy's ready to stab him  He runs at him  And gets hit by a buzz  And he's just  Walking through this  Horrid place  Patrice used to get  Really mad at me  He used to  Oh yeah yeah  He would talk about that  What the man  I can't imitate him  But he would  He would get really angry  At me  And then finally  He'd just go  Have fun man  Have a great time  Yeah yeah  Have a great time  Do you know how many times  I've tried to get things done  I'm like we're in the middle 
[03:06:30]  Of doing something  I'm like where's Jonathan  Oh uh  Cambodia  Yeah yeah  He's in uh  He's in Kurtahala  What  What  Where was that  Kurtahala  You ever go to  Cold places  Yeah  North Pole  South Pole  Alaska  Any of these places  Yeah  Like Budweyan  The cold places  Aren't as much fun  I would imagine  They're just not  Like you know  Southeast Asia  Africa  Uh  You know  That's some crazy stuff  There's some jungles  You like jungles 
[03:07:00]  And  I like deserts too though  Deserts yeah  I was in uh  Timbuktu  Which was pretty awesome  And uh  And then I went north  That's a real place  I know right  I was just gonna go  People go there  Really  Yeah  I hear it's an amazing place  It's amazing  People love it there  It's amazing  Why  Oh yeah  You're kidding  No no I'm not kidding  I have heard that over the years  It's amazing  But why do they love it so much  I think because it's  It's this  It's so far to get to  It literally  Um  It's really hard to get to  And when you get there  You feel like this sort of  Sense of accomplishment  Because you're there 
[03:07:30]  It's the oldest  Uh  Some of the oldest buildings  In all of Africa  Which I mean literally  That's old  That's old  And uh  It's uh  It's this  You know  There's so much  It's so mythic  The city  Um  You know  For centuries  People thought  It was uh  There was gold in the streets  And stuff like that  And  They were surprised  When they got there  But uh  It was the birthplace  Of the first  Islamic universities  In Africa  And that's  Why it's so significant  But also the 
[03:08:00]  Um  It's the gateway  To the Sahara  And uh  And it wasn't until  I think  I mean  In relative terms  It was discovered  In I think  1836  And uh  That's  That's kind of late  I mean that's  Yeah  That's not that long ago  If you think about it  You know  Um  The first guy  Who went there  Was an  An  Tim  No  It was an  How much did it  Cost him to get in  He was a  He was a  He was an 
[03:08:30]  Englishman  I think it was  Major Alexander  Gordon Lang  Oh yeah  But he didn't get out  Um  Oh  Yeah  The bandits  Oh  Yeah  They banded  Yeah  Not good  And then it wasn't  Until a French guy  Later came  Learned the language  Converted to Islam  And he got out  And he actually  Wrote about  Timbuktu  Wretched hive  Of scum and villainy  Sounds like to me  Yeah  Yeah  You ever been to  Mos Eisley  Spaceport  Sounds like a place  You'd go  You've been around  Enough places  What do you think  Of Muslims in general 
[03:09:00]  And Islam  It's fine  You know  I think it's  Because I feel like  Americans in general  We don't know much about it  No I don't  I think it's  I mean  I literally think  They're so  There's really no difference  I mean  They have a religion  That's different  But I don't  I don't see them  I honestly don't think  They're  It's weird to even  Say it that way  But no  I think they're  Regular normal people  You know  I mean 
[03:09:30]  You realize  The fanatics  It's  It's  The tiniest  Percentage  I was in  Afghanistan  And  If you think about  This is an amazing  Statistic  In Afghanistan  There's  28 million people  Roughly  There is  The number is  Staggering  It's 20,000 Taliban  That's it  20,000  So if you think  About it in that term  You think the rest  Of those  28 million people  20,000 bad eggs  Yeah  They ruin it  For everybody else  Oh yeah  Tell me where you're  Going this weekend 
[03:10:00]  Oh  I'm going to  Oh Kenny  It's 10 o'clock  He's unshotted  Kenny wants out of here  Kenny knows when we  Start with the plugs  That's it  Come on Kenny  Kenny wants out  But we should talk about  Vaughn and the album  Absolutely  Patrice  Yes  I don't know if it's  My boring stories  Mr. P  February 7th  But you can  Get it on pre-order  Yeah pre-order that  And also the  The best of the  16 hours from here  Yes 
[03:10:30]  Go to audible.com  Audible.com  Slash Patrice  It's great stuff  We ain't taking none of that money  The album is the funny  I'm serious  Like it's hard to listen to  Yeah  You know I mean  Emotionally it's hard to listen to  But it's hilarious  Oh my god  It's you know  You guys have heard all the tracks  Oh yeah  No  I still can't listen to  Yeah I listen to it  I'm still not  It's just  It's some of his best stuff  Call me whatever  But I still can't listen to  Best stuff he's ever done  It's weird  I listened to it before  Yeah  To Lou the African  Before everything happened  And then listening to it after 
[03:11:00]  Is hard  Yeah I'll get there  But I'm still not there  Yeah  Yeah  My favorite track  Other than Tolu  I love that track  Is Reparations  Yeah  Yeah  I really enjoy his take on that  Of course  Everyone's going to want to be black soon  Yeah  I tortured the drivers  In the car I was in in Africa  Because I  Show the makeup for it  No I literally  Literally  Because we had these long stretches of road in the car  And I was playing the album  And because they couldn't really understand it  You know it was super boring for them 
[03:11:30]  But for me I was like  You know  I said this is so fitting  And so I'm driving through Africa  Listening to Patrice  Did they understand Tolu  No  It just  You know  I mean literally like  The driver was angry at me  Because it was just like  You know  Why are you making people angry  Don't anger people  I would be like  What would you like to listen to  I mean you know  I listened  Your head's coming off  For literally  Don't make him angry  Put on some Enya  For the ride  Yeah  Keep everyone chill and mellow  No but 
[03:12:00]  That's right folks  And Enya joke  He  No but he  He'd listened to his music for a long time  And so I was like  Do you want to play something  And I'm like  Yeah  I want to play this  And I just put it on  And it was funny  Driving through Africa  And you know  Hearing Patrice the whole time  Yeah  It was pretty cool  I'm sure he did not like that  Patrice meaning  I think he would have found it amusing  That it was annoying the driver  Oh yeah  He'd have liked that one  Of course  Yeah  Motherfucker  Well yeah 
[03:12:30]  Mr. P comes out February 7th  But he can pre-order on iTunes  And I'll post all the links on my Twitter  You can go to  At Bondi Carlo  And I'll post up all the links  Yeah  Very cool  How's your daughter doing?  Funny  Good  We went to  She had a student showcase last night  And she had her little dance solo  So she was excited about that  And I'm just you know  Up and down  Yeah  We're still the same  Yeah  You know  None of that like  Toddlers and Tiaras stuff is it?  No I am not  You're not stage mommy 
[03:13:00]  You're not stage mommy?  No  She's really on her own  Yeah  You know with that whole thing  Well not on her own  I know how to support her  But she's  You're not pushing her  These are all her ideas  Yeah you're not  Certainly not mine  No  But she's not to push  You're not standing in the audience  No  Acting out the moves in front of the stage  No  I usually don't even know what it's going to be  Yeah  And so I get there  Yeah she doesn't  You know  She never wants me at rehearsals or anything  She's like  No I got this  Oh kids  What are you going to do?  Yeah well  Oh Uncle Paul  Do you guys have moments 
[03:13:30]  Like I do  Like some weird moments  Like when I came back from Africa  It really got to me  Like it really got to me  The trees?  Yeah  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Really did  You got those moments  It was almost easy  Going through the memorial  And all that  Right  It's when you're left  With your own thoughts  And then when I went to Africa  It's like  It's something I wasn't thinking about  But it's hard  Because you're  You know you're really focused  On what you're doing  When you're there  So when I came back  It just hit me like wow  And I had this moment  Of like  It really  Yeah  I looked down this dumb hall 
[03:14:00]  And I  I just visioned him  Walking down the hall  Getting ready to do radio with us  I want to change my seat  At this point  I don't want to see that anymore  It's funny because I still  I saved the voicemails  That I have you know  Yeah  And it's weird  Listening to him  Like you know  Sometimes I like listening to him  Sometimes I get really depressed  But there was one  When he did the roast  And in typical Patrice  He  We found out  He was going to go last  This is a Charlie Sheen roast  And when he  When he found out  He was going to go last  He left me 
[03:14:30]  Left me this message  Like John  He did good  He did good  And I thought  Oh this is  A nice message  And then  He started complimenting me  And then I realized  There's too many compliments  Oh something's coming  I know what it was  And then it was like  Well you tried buddy  You tried  You tried buddy  I'm going last  And  Oh shit  And I was like  Oh no  And then  You know  He got me for that moment  Where I thought  That's so sweet 
[03:15:00]  Yeah  You know  That's so nice  And then he pitched him  He was like  But you tried buddy  That's just a tough spot  Huh  Going last  Everything's been done  For most people  I think it is  I think it's brutal  Well he handled it  He spun that right around  Absolutely  I mean  He did it pretty masterfully  I thought  Oh fuck yeah  He got up there  And  Yep  It was amazing  And the best  He threw away  All the stuff  Oh yeah  At that point  Because all the joke jokes  Have been done already  And when you do these roasts  The network has 
[03:15:30]  Like a team of writers  That they want to see  Every joke  They want to look at it  And he didn't care  He just did not care  And he was like  I'm not showing them stuff  And they sent  Kurt Metzger  To come to his hotel room  And so  Trying to get some idea  Kurt was trying to write down  He was helping Patrice a lot  Because Patrice really liked him  And  But they were  He was trying to write down  Some of the jokes  Just so you can go back  To the writer room  And say hey look  This is sort of  What he's thinking of doing  And then 
[03:16:00]  And it was so last minute  For Patrice too  Because he was filming  The movie  Scoutmasters  Yeah  And then  And then  He had to fly out  And do that  And then fly right back  So it was  He felt like everyone  Had so much time to prepare  And then he's like  Just doing it  Off the cuff anyway  But the funny thing was  When they  So when he got up there  He just threw away  The jokes  That he had written  From the night before  I mean he kept a couple of them  But like  He just  And it was amazing to watch  Yeah  He just  It was the 
[03:16:30]  Standout performance  On that road  That line  When he looked at Charlie  He's like  You know you're acting  And it kind of sucks  But in a Christian Slater-ish  Kind of way  So it's kind of good  But it still kind of sucks  That was totally  Off the cuff  It was like  Completely  I've never seen him  Write for the stage  Whenever he's  Doing his thing  He has the context  He has the points  That he wants to make  And then  He just goes  The ability  To be able to  Rattle off shit  Off the cuff 
[03:17:00]  Like that  Is just amazing  One of the writers  In the show  Was like  Well I really want  To see his jokes  And I was like  Sorry  You tell him  Good luck  It's just not  Going to happen  And it's like  But that's what  Gets me about  Networks  They don't learn  Those things  Like they can't  They still think  They can control  Somebody  So they're like  And think that's  Going to make  Things better  Yeah  We just want  To see it  I need to see it  We've got to see it  You know  And 
[03:17:30]  Why  Because  Throughout history  They've always seen it  Yeah  So we have to see it  So as not to change anything  And I'm like  You can't imagine  The discussion  You're going to have to have  You know  Yeah  I could go back  And deliver the message for you  And I'll have a discussion  That'll last an hour  But the one you really  Want to have with them  You should have it  Yeah  You know  Yeah  You'll come back  That's great  Oh fuck  Well Mr. P  Available on iTunes  Yes  Right now  Pre-order  Right now 
[03:18:00]  Out February 7th  Very cool  We're going for the day  And people are calling  Jonathan Mr. Magoo  With your analysis  Where you have no awareness  What's going on around you  But you're skating through it all  Oh look  Some friendly natives  Oh Magoo  And you know  They're fucking  Blow guns  You know  You would  You should come  Oh  You know  I just thought of a place  That I  You think Anthony  Should go to Africa  Yes  I want to be one of the gun guys  If Anthony goes  I'm going  Yeah 
[03:18:30]  I'm going  There are some places  That exist  Where you can buy guns  Like  Yeah  And I know you like that  But you don't want to be  One of the guys  With a gun  In Africa  It's almost like that  Don't take your guns  To town song  Yeah  You're like  They're probably  A little more experienced  With killing people  Than I am  And you know  You're going to have to  Teach me how to shoot though  Because I don't think  I've ever picked up a gun  Really  Never  Oh man  But wouldn't you get  You've got to go  To go in like a gun market  That would be very cool  Yeah  I mean  Yeah  By the way  When I was in Ivory Coast 
[03:19:00]  I saw the president  The Ivarian president  He was  His motorcade  It was a big motorcade  You know  It was probably about 25 cars  But  Unlike motorcades  For like our president  And stuff  There  The first car  Is a giant flatbed truck  With like 10 soldiers in it  And bazookas  Like actual bazookas  Oh right  And then the last truck  Is a bunch of guys  With bazookas  And then the other cars  Are you know  Like SUVs  And what not  That's so they can't  Block you in  But if somebody pulls  A car in front of you  To try to block it in  I guess it's just 
[03:19:30]  Just instantly taken away  Wow  Yeah that's  You ever see anyone murdered?  No  Killed?  Whatever?  No  He's like no  He thought for a second  Not ready to talk about that stuff  If you go to Saudi Arabia  It's that poor goat  On the side of the road  Man I think you can  Every Friday  You know they have this  The  What's the name of the square?

[03:22:00]  Like in my show  Yeah we got to start poaching  Your guests  Oh Jim would love that  He loves  I didn't know Jim Norris was a fan  Like I thought y'all were super white up here  I thought y'all were racist too  But I'm sorry man  In this case he is a fan  But it doesn't matter  Like if you're interviewing  Somebody famous  That Jim hasn't taken a picture with yet  No way  Yeah they started debating  Whether or not he was an Oscar winner  And I'm like  He's an Oscar winner  If he's not he should be  Exactly  Right there  Hell yeah  He was wearing  And he was wearing  Like a three piece suit 
[03:22:30]  Stripes and everything  Very nice suit  The hair was all slick back  He's like  I don't know  Like I asked him  I said  How do you still look so swaggy  And all the women love you  And  Yeah  And he said that  There's this ointment  That he uses every morning  Ointment  He puts it over the suit  He puts it over the suit  Over the suit  He does not  He just gets dressed  Yeah  That's pretty funny  I mean  I'm  I'm personally  Into the  Dark skin brothers  But  Yeah  You know  Terrence Howard  He has dark skin swag 
[03:23:00]  If that makes any sense  But you going  On this channel  And saying you're into  The dark skin  That's disappointing  99.9%  And the people listening  There's like  Three people out there  Who still might have a shot  You don't like Drake  You don't think Drake is  Alright let's keep it moving  You don't like child  I like Drake when he sings  Okay  Okay  You don't like the fact  He's half Jewish  And black  Well I have white  And half black  I'm down for the halfies 
[03:23:30]  However  If we're talking about  Like what my eyeballs  Are attracted to  You know  Plus he  You know  Him talking about  Being on  Degrassi Junior High  And all that stuff  Probably  I have a 12 year old  I knew him  Of Degrassi  Before I knew  Of him anywhere else  I knew who Jimmy Brooks  Was before I knew  Who Drake was  And my daughters  Like me too  She always goes  Oh he's cute  Every time she says  Someone is cute  It's like  You know  50 cent 
[03:24:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Well Patrice  Wouldn't have it  Any other way  Though  He wouldn't  Patrice wouldn't care  No  He would just be happy  Maybe I wasn't  Bothering him  Oh my god  Yeah  Can you get his number  Like leave me  The hell alone  Yeah just don't  Talk to me  Talk to him then  That's funny  Seriously  I don't know  If you noticed  What Jim and me  Were laughing at  The whole time  You were in here  With Jonathan  Have you noticed  Jonathan's bulge  Jim's manager  Jonathan his bulge  I personally did not  Notice his bulge  Because I  Crotch bulge  He's white  Yeah  And I did not know 
[03:24:30]  They had bulges  Don't even  I've never seen  One of those  Getting racist again  I'm not racist  It's just observant  But you don't even  Have to look like  Ooh  Like you just look  Like it's something  Like either  It's funny  Or it's just interesting  Like it's like  A wonder of the world  You know  Because he's got  A massive bulge  I don't really look  At bulges  Like guys look  At boobs  No  No  I don't notice bulges  Well guys look  At bulges then  I guess  I would have  Never noticed  Now I'm looking  At bulges  You know what 
[03:25:00]  I just realized  Why  Because black men  You can't see  Their bulge  Their pants  Are like  The loose pants  Except for Lil Wayne  I mean yeah  He wears jackets  You know  He wears the girl joints  I don't want to  I don't want to  This is going to be  Tired in your joints  I borrowed his pants  But Jonathan  Jonathan's  Norton's manager  He was in here  Talking about his travels  And everything  And the whole time  Yeah which I contribute  It nothing to  How could you  I mean his stories  Are like the most  Unrelated  Like they're interesting  But there's not even  A little bit  That's relatable 
[03:25:30]  What do you travel to  You went to like  Paris or something  Paris  He goes to like  Places you would  Rather kill yourself  Than go to  Iowa  Sorry  The last time  He called in  Places you never heard of  He called in  From West Africa  Last time he was on  And he was like  Hang on  There's some rebels  That we have to deal with  Nah come on  And he had to go  And then he came back  Everything's good  He has pictures  With guys  With guns  Like the size  Of your whole  Half a body  Did he have sex 
[03:26:00]  With no condom  Out there  I don't know  For sure  I doubt it  I would say no  I wouldn't think so  He's married  He gets off on just  Going to these places  It's not like  You know  Going to Brazil  Is he racist  He don't want a black girl  No it's not that  No  I just think it's that  He just likes to travel  To dangerous places  He's like  He's like the crocodile hunter  Yeah  Because he doesn't  He doesn't even  Go in tour groups  Like my fiancee  Wants to go to Bermuda  After the wedding  And I'm like  What about the triangle 
[03:26:30]  I don't want to go to Bermuda  Yeah but it's  This is very boring  Over there  And where  Girls don't give up  Ass in Bermuda  Have you ever been  To Brazil  Yeah they give up  Ass  Like I still got  Ass in my pocket  Patrice took me  To Brazil  Oh my god  And woo wee  I mean  Patrice gave me  The pass for man code  You know  As we went along  Because you know  Kind of a down ass  Well I wasn't  Yeah  But in Brazil  I went into  One of the  Strip clubs  Bananas 
[03:27:00]  Where you put on the robe  Yeah  Where you put on the robe  And I'm like  At first  At first they didn't  Want to let me in  Because you know  You can't bring hookers  In  And they're like  No no no no  She's Americana  She's not a hooker  They thought you were a hooker  They thought I was Brazilian  They thought I was a Brazilian  Yeah you were Brazilian though  No  All American  From Pittsburgh  Ghost Steelers  Did you have a tan  Was that a tan  Like you were a little burnt  No my mom is white  Like as white as Sam  And my dad is like  Darker than you  For real  And I think  I pick up  Hi yellow chick 
[03:27:30]  I think I picked up  The paleness from my mom  Like this is my tan  I'm coming off  Of my summer tan  Like I don't get  But you go  And the people who go  To the strip clubs  Wear the robes  Well  The strip club  In quotes  Yeah big quotes  She is incredible  You put on the robes  And you know  And the wall opens up  And you choose  Oh boy yeah  Wow  I went there  You did  You fold your arms  I felt like a dude 
[03:28:00]  I have penis envy  Like you would not believe  Like I admire men  I think men are dope  Like dope  You just like to have  They can swing it around  That's what you want  No forget the penis part  You said penis envy  Well penis envy meaning  Man swag  Got you  Like man  Like I'm a man  Do you have that  I don't necessarily  Need a penis  You don't have that yo  Do I have the jealousy  Or the vibe  I think I have more  The jealousy  No  No I think Von  Has more swag than me 
[03:28:30]  Okay  It's not necessarily  The swag  It's just nature  Like men have  Every man  Has like a  Just a quiet  Little respect  That you just get  As a man  Like top of the food chain  Yeah  You're just men  Lion  You're just men  They have that  Nick Cannon thing  I don't know  If Nick Cannon  Well putting their babies  In suit jackets  Who could  Who could  He did  An hour  On his show  On Nick Cannon  Putting his newborn babies  In suit jackets  And why would you put 
[03:29:00]  A newborn in a suit jacket  I didn't know about that  The worst photo ever  And then he tweeted the photo  It doesn't even help  My eye is scary  He's doing those  Horrible commercials  Where it  Fucking  What you doing commercials for  I don't know  Weight Watch is one of them  She's got a gut out  Every time you come on  This channel  You start dissing  Nick Cannon  He just had  Some liver thing  Like his liver popped out  Is he okay  I mean  I don't know him  I feel sorry for him  I was crying  I felt bad 
[03:29:30]  Because I just went  Through all of that  With Patrice  When he had his stroke  So I know  What that feels like  Being in a hospital  With your man  He didn't have a stroke  He had shit in his liver  They said it was  Mild kidney failure  How is it mild  Like what's mild about that  I don't know  It's called a pulvisis  Yeah  I think you need to  Just shit on yourself  And act like you're sick  Or something  And get some promo  People cried though  I cried  I didn't cry  But I was nervous  For Mariah  Oh for real  And I don't know her 
[03:30:00]  But just  Just being a woman  In the situation  I was just in  In the hospital  With Patrice  I don't wish that on  Anyone  The kids are safe though  They got the jackets  You know  The jackets  You know what  I'm going to show her  The photo  I'm not going to get  I think I'm not going to get  A serious moment  With who kid  No that doesn't happen  But you're like  You're like  You try to break it down  For a second  And then he's going to drop out  He's like  What about the boners  But you know what's serious though  Terrence Howard had  Beyonce's baby photo  In his wallet  What? 
[03:30:30]  Jay-Z gave it to certain  Homies that he's cool with  Terrence Howard is  Jay-Z's homie like that?  Yeah I got the photo  I saw it  And the baby did look like Jake  The baby looked just like Jay-Z  I got a picture of blue  Ivy blue  Ivy blue  Hell no  Yeah you got it too  Nah but they're part of  Illuminati now  Terrence Howard is  You know I put in my application  Years ago  And it just didn't go through  For real?  No they're like  Fuck you  This is the racism  The white people  You could convince  Most white people  That you're Jay-Z's friend  And he gave you  A picture of Ivy blue 
[03:31:00]  Just because you're black  Really?  Yeah I think so  Like for a second  Y'all still think that?  Yeah it's like  Yeah I can see that  Oh really?  I didn't know you guys were friends  Yeah okay  You know what?  I'm gonna try that  I'm gonna try that  E-Rock  Yeah  For a second  Did you think Von and Jay-Z  Were kind  They could be close  Like for a second  I could see it  Yeah you see what I'm saying?  You know why that is  No  Let me not speak  Let me not speak  Because I am right  Like Eric 
[03:31:30]  Eric is really racist  So like you see  E-Rock in there  He's racist enough  That he actually  Dye his hair blonde  I know he's like  The not so slim  Shady or something  I like this guy man  You like E-Rock  You're like Eminem  On donuts  Eminem  Eminem three years ago  Yipes  I forgot  You know I really forgot  Eminem used to be like  Like chubby kind of  He did?  Is that when he was like  For like five seconds  He got a six pack now  Now he's like  He does?  I mean that's still not gonna work for me  But  Because he's white  Yeah 
[03:32:00]  But Mariah Carey  You know he was happy with that  You know  He fucked Mariah Carey right?  I don't think  White guys find me attractive  To be honest  You don't think so?  I think it's my own insecurity  Like I know  You know  How to deal with  Black men easily  That's my  Cup of tea  How many guys  You gave blue balls to?  I don't know  Thousands right?  No  I'm not a tease  What?  Like you just let them  No  I'm so happy right now 
[03:32:30]  I do not play that game  If we are in that vicinity  It's gonna happen  Right  I just wet myself too  A little bit  Who gets easily excitable  I'm wet right now  That was easy  Yeah  Norton is asked  Requesting that we talk more about  Jonathan's bulge  I swear  I'm sitting there on the couch  Where is Jonathan?  Bring his bulge in here  I don't know where he's at  I was sitting there on that couch  And Jim was here  And Jim is looking at me  He's like  Come here  Sam  Come here  And so I go over to his side of the table 
[03:33:00]  Just so I can get the proper view  Of Jonathan's bulge  From that direction  It's like he's packing a potato  In his pants  In the front of his pants  I have to see it  You have to  This is gonna be uncomfortable  Because I'm gonna be with Jonathan  All day today  Looking at his bulge  And you're going to the Borgata right?  Yes  I'm going to AC this weekend  So you'll be able to  Are you gonna be  I'm in AC Saturday  Oh  I thought you were supposed to be here Saturday  Oh okay  Saturday I'm in  Huh?  I thought you were supposed to be here Saturday  No after  Oh okay  I was about to say  Don't kill this illusion  No I'm at the Borgata 
[03:33:30]  I'm gonna have some moisture over there  Because Jonathan and his bulge  Are gonna be there too  Are they?  You know what's funny too?  I don't know if I wanna see it  It'll come Saturday  But they set me up to come Sunday  Yeah  Maybe I'll drive down both days  I don't know  Now that we're saying it on the air  Like fans are gonna be looking around  And they're gonna be able to spot Jonathan  Because he'll be the guy that they don't know  With the bulge  That's hanging out with ONA and Jim and everything  Is that real or he has like a pamper in there?  I'm sure it's real  I think it's real  But Jim  Like Jonathan doesn't think on that level  Like oh I need to have a bulge  So it has to be real  Did he unzip and show you the bulge?  No because Jim says  No I guess he just 
[03:34:00]  He gets very uncomfortable with Jonathan  When you bring it up  That's the one thing  Like he'll talk about traveling  And this and that  And he'll do his chip  And his Ted Checkler impressions  And all this  But he doesn't like talking about the bulge  Really?  Like if you ask him  What are you packing Jonathan?  Like seriously  What are you  No no no  What are Opie and Anthony's there about the bulge?  We didn't talk about it on the air  Jim was just noticing it  And he kept pointing it out to me  He wouldn't notice that  Because whenever Jim and I have traveled anywhere  At some point every day 
[03:34:30]  Like if it's multiple days  Like we were in San Diego for Comic Con  Or when I was with him in Harrisburg  Like every day at some point  Jonathan's bulge comes up in conversation  Wow  And he goes  One time he goes  He goes oh dude we talk about this all the time  Watch this  And he texted Florentine  Jim Florentine  Out of nowhere he just goes  Hey Jim  Who's got the biggest bulge that we know?  And Florentine texts back  Jonathan  That's like a no brainer  He likes it  Okay can I ask a girl question?  Yeah  Okay  When we say bulge  Yeah 
[03:35:00]  Are these bulge  Or is this a penis?  This is a great question  Because E-Rock  Has stripped down to his boxer briefs  To get on the strip pole before  And so his bulge  You can see in his bulge  Hell no  That it's a lot of testicle  Like E-Rock's bulge is not  A lot of shafts  Mainly testicle  That's at least what the bulge appears to be  You saw all that man  Okay we're going to have to change the subject  Jesus  Are you asking?  I know  But let's understand  That I haven't had sex in a long time  I mean  Is this E-Rock's like  Testicles turning you off?  I think anything would at this point 
[03:35:30]  Wow  And she don't give blue balls out  You heard her?  She said she don't give any blue balls out  No I don't play those  Yeah but her saying that  Probably gave you blue balls  Nah  I mean if you give blue balls from a distance  That is not my issue  Yeah  But you know  If we are in the vicinity  It is going to happen  You think Jay-Z baby  Gonna make you horny?  Can I make you horny?  Watch out Melissa  Wait wait  Back up  A weak old girl man  They say this baby is so incredible  It's making people come  Everybody's happy  No that is sick 
[03:36:00]  My man ate all his breakfast this morning  Cause of the baby  Who did?  Some random neighbor of mine  Oh I got you  Post pregnant Beyonce might make me horny though  I want to see what she's going to look like  Yeah  Yo the fact that the baby looks like Jay-Z  Everybody's just happy with that  Who says the baby looks like  You saw the baby  Jay-Z said it on the song  First of all who gets lying  He didn't see the baby  Wait wait wait wait  He's lying he's lying  Hold on  Second of all  He did not record that song like that day did he? 
[03:36:30]  No he was  Yeah after the baby was born  He looked at the eyes  And the face  And the nose  And then he went in the studio  Can I tell you something  And got the verse  That day?  Do you know what Who Kid's doing?  No  He's trying to not make fun of that baby for looking like Jay-Z  Like Who Kid has made videos online  You played the record up here  First of all  Jay-Z is a good looking man  Can we start there?  Roland  Do a Google search  Oh my gosh  She needs help  Who Kid jocking Jay-Z  See if it comes up 
[03:37:00]  Because  Women see men differently than what you would expect  This is what Who Kid Jay-Z looks like  Jay-Z has the ultimate swagger  Leave him alone  Your jocking Jay-Z video  Jay-Z do got swag  He is the shit  If he could bang Beyonce  He got a lot of swag  Exactly  But I mean  Beyonce's a regular girl  Like the rest of us  Well she used to be  But then she became this flower of excellence  And moisture  Quick camel gate  You gotta have  Even if she was a regular girl  Walking down the street  She's extremely pretty  And you're gonna have to have 
[03:37:30]  A certain amount of  Energy  Swagger  I knew when she was in Destiny's Child  When she had pimples and stuff  I knew that area  You know  Are you sure she still has pimples  Just cause she's Beyonce  Doesn't mean she doesn't get breakouts  Click play rolling  But I wish the baby looked like Beyonce  Watch this Ron  Look at this video Who Kid did  And go to his website  Radioplanet.tv  This is awful  This is why  This is why  Who Kid  This is why he keeps bringing up  That the baby looks like Jay-Z  This is what Who Kid's doing 
[03:38:00]  So you're on the camel thing  Yeah but what  Who Kid's getting up on the camel  No homo  But me and Jay got close in Morocco  That's a camel  No that's Jay  Wait till you see the close ups  I got the Jordans  Oh look  Watch this  Watch the camel  I give up man  I want to get killed 
[03:38:30]  Because of this video  You should get killed  Because of this video  And then he does the rock sign  It's fucked up  Can you move over  Before you get shot  I don't want to catch on  It's fucked up  This is fucked up  Because I love  Who Kid  As much  As much as I'm a fan of yours  Like  I gotta leave now  I love Jay-Z  Damn  So do I  Who doesn't love Jay-Z  Well you made camel  Look at this  Look at the picture 
[03:39:00]  This is Jay  This is Who Kid's website  It does not look like a camel  Put it out  I mean in that  Oh my lord  You're sick  And then  And then  This is why  Who Kid keeps bringing up  I'm blinking slow  This is why Who Kid keeps bringing up  I gotta tell you  The eyes  The nose  Everything  The baby looks just like Jay-Z  First of all  You guys play the record up here  I heard y'all going in on the record  Anthony was making some jokes  Okay  Did you hear the song?  Yes  Did Jay-Z  Did you hear the miscarriage talk?  Yes I did 
[03:39:30]  Well Anthony comparing Jay-Z's first baby  To stewed tomatoes  Oh man  You guys are terrible  I wouldn't say it  You gotta never talk about me  I wouldn't say that  But Who Kid  You're coming in and you're saying  Yeah me and Jay-Z your boy  Just show the picture  Bye bye  And then  We had cappuccino  Making this camel video  The views and opinions expressed  For kids only  Look  If you hear the verse in the record  He said  The baby looks like me  Ugh  Well he would say that  First of all  Do you think  That he 
[03:40:00]  We are talking about human beings here  Do you think he does not know  That people say  He looks like a camel  And that the baby's gonna look like him  And not be attractive  And do you think he does not know that  No he knows that  Of course he knows  But the fact is  I wanna see this baby's face  Like  Why?  So you can make another video?  I called Bloomberg this morning  You know what I'm saying  He was doing yoga  And he was fingering himself  So he was like  Bloomberg was  Mayor Bloomberg  Yeah he was like  Wow  That's hot  Let's remember my issue here  I'm sorry  Who kid 
[03:40:30]  Mayor Bloomberg is enough right now  To turn her on like a little bit  Of course he gets horny  For me Bloomberg  Figuring himself  Yeah  I mean  It's been a while  He got the photo  He got the photo  Bloomberg has the photo  Bloomberg got  He said yeah  It looks like Kay  You know  And by the way  We're gonna go into strike tomorrow  You understand now  That who kid was lying  About seeing this photo  Right  He lied to your face  I'm catching up  I'm very  I'm very gullible  In a sense  He's one  Hey you know  Can you play my video? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah  That way we have the song  I don't have the  Music with me  It's a music video  Or a sex tape  Was it?  No please  Patrice and I  I don't think we  Have any sex tapes  Come on  No way  You made them  But you don't think  You have them anymore  They were erased  I don't have them  Okay  So  Okay  I don't know  I think  So that means  They might pop up  Like in a couple weeks later  No I doubt it  I know  Absolutely not  Patrice would never  He would never  I would  Oh  But  The only person 
[03:41:30]  That might be able  To relate to  Jonathan's travels  Is Hukid  Because Hukid's  Like traveling  Like they hire him  In Bahrain  All the time  To do parties  You wanna go on  Some wild trip  And we see  Jay-Z everywhere  I'm actually in  Turkey next week too  You're going to  Turkey?  Istanbul  I don't even  I don't understand  No  Can you invite me  Somewhere better?  No it's hot over there  They got ill clubs  Popping  You know  Rich people  Billionaires  You know  Because you ain't  Out with like  Royalty  Like who could
