<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the return of Jim Norton from Los Angeles, where he’d been filming for HBO.  The hosts relentlessly teased Norton about his perceived diva-like behavior, particularly regarding microphone preferences, during his absence.  A listener's question about the difference between Norton and Patrice O'Neal's roles on the show prompted a discussion of their respective histories and the show's rotating cast of guest comedians.  The segment was rife with vulgar and offensive jokes targeting various demographics.  A listener-submitted pornographic sound effect was played and analyzed, and the hosts also discussed a video of Patrice O'Neal's roast and a news story about a firefighter who committed a sexual assault and attempted suicide.  The show promoted several upcoming events: a recent rally, a planned “Homeless Shopping Spree” at the Palisades Center Mall, and a live broadcast from the same mall the following afternoon.  Multiple callers phoned in, some familiar with the show's inside jokes, others less so.  Elton John's marriage and "Candle in the Wind" were mocked with crudely rewritten lyrics, and a clip from Imus’ show mentioning Norton and his website was briefly discussed. The broadcast also highlighted a New Jersey hunter's record-sized bear kill.

The show continued with a rambling, comedic parody of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," incorporating New York Yankees players and their scandals. This transitioned into a discussion of Dennis Leary's cynical view of Christmas lies and the hypocrisy of adults. A caller then shared an exaggerated story about his ex-girlfriend and his mother's cancer diagnosis, met with morbid humor from the hosts.  The hosts then discussed the *Daily News*'s "worst movies of the year" list, interspersed with tangents about celebrity look-alikes (Norton resembling Emma Watson), a missed opportunity to meet Isaac Hayes, and more listener calls.  The movie "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" sparked debate about its merits, with differing opinions from callers nationwide.  A caller discussed racial slurs in Patrice O'Neal's stand-up, and another recounted a bizarre cruise ship incident possibly involving murder. The segment included further listener calls, movie discussions, and an XM Radio commercial, with repeated mentions of the upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree."

The next segment began with a darkly comedic discussion about murdering a wife on a cruise, complete with elaborate plans.  The hosts then heavily promoted the upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree" at the Palisades Center Mall.  Matt from Texas called in about seeing "Brokeback Mountain," leading to a discussion of the film and its impact, followed by a review of the *Daily News*' top ten movies, including "Brokeback Mountain," "Crash," and "Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada."  The hosts' opinions ranged from praise to disdain, with frequent tangents involving webcams, celebrity name-dropping, and anecdotes about encounters with various actors, including a negative experience with Brian Cox and Jimmy's awkward encounters with Scarlett Johansson and Woody Allen.  A caller corrected the pronunciation of "quixotic," sparking a discussion on big words. Another offered a vacation in Tampa including access to machine guns. The review continued with "March of the Penguins" (leading to a discussion about paralyzing penguins for a bowling alley stunt), "Good Night and Good Luck," and "The Aristocrats." A listener shared a gruesome anecdote about Argentinian soldiers using penguins for warmth during the Falklands War.  "A History of Violence" was revealed as the *Daily News*' number one movie, and compared to the women's list, highlighting the discrepancies.  The segment concluded with Isaac Hayes unexpectedly entering the studio.

The final segment featured Isaac Hayes as a guest.  The conversation focused on his personal life, including his multiple marriages and numerous children (estimated 11-12 from 8 women).  He shared details of his relationships, including a humorous anecdote about meeting his third wife naked in a hotel room. He also discussed his recovery from a difficult second marriage with the help of his bandmates. A significant portion of the interview covered his involvement with Scientology, defending the organization and addressing common criticisms. He discussed his career, including his work on *South Park* and his new album *Can You Dig It*, sharing anecdotes such as receiving a $10,000 gift from Richard Pryor. The segment concluded with a discussion of his radio career, an upcoming appearance on Conan O'Brien's show, a comedic bit involving a "chocolate salty balls" recipe (referencing *South Park*), and brief mentions of their planned restaurant and the "Homeless Shopping Spree."

[00:00:00]  Satsang with Mooji 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Two total dorks.  Am I listening to a radio show?  Two DJs and a tranny lover.  That's what this program is about, mister.  Only creeps listen to this program.  Go, boys.  What's happening, man?  Burn your fucking radio show!  Anyone around here ever smell my ass?  It's lovely.  Come on, we're going to tell you how to get chicks.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm a horribly boring person.  We just kind of laugh at him.  He's getting better, but we've got to break his head still. 
[00:04:30]  He's a candidate for killing his wife when he gets married.  I love E-Rock into the console.  Oh, Snapple and Mayo, you're a dumb smug, you lovely.  And featuring...  I think there's a degree of mental illness with everybody on the show.  Ramone, Ramone, Ramone.  Eric's breath smells like the diaper of a cancer patient.  Can I say for the record that this program sucks a fat dick?  I got a few ideas, I can get it fired.  Please use them.  Please use them. 
[00:05:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Bop, bop, bop.  Bop, bop.  I just can't get the nigga in. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  Don't tell me you know that sound, Jimmy.  Do you know what that is, Jimmy?  Jimmy looked up in the air like, wait, I've heard that before. 
[00:06:00]  I think I know that sound.  If it's familiar to you, I hope it's not a sound you heard behind you.  Is it a movie or no?  Uh, yes, it's a movie.  Yeah.  How about going on mic, Mr. Fucking Los Angeles?  The guy's eating.  He's three feet away from a mic.  I'm sorry, babe.  You forgot how to do radio.  He's used to people following around with a boom mic.  Is that how we're going to have to do the show? 
[00:06:30]  We're going to have to give Travis a boom mic to follow Jimmy around now.  He's a diva.  He doesn't want to talk into a microphone.  L-A diva.  This thing kind of messes my hair up, too.  I don't want to do it flat.  Yes, that Hollywood look.  What is that from that's really familiar?  Is it?  I'm thinking of another yell.  So, what do you think is going on during that? 
[00:07:00]  I'm guessing it sounds like the gimp when he's raping.  But, yeah, I don't know.  It's a porno.  That's a porn of some black guy banging some white chick and coming.  And that's what he does when he has an orgasm.  And the chick was laughing because it's just so over the top.  I don't know what the fuck he's doing there.  That's also what he sounds like when he's trying to read aloud. 
[00:07:30]  No, it sounded like it reminded me a little bit of Dustin Hoffman, for some reason, screaming.  Oh, no, the marathon man.  Marathon man?  Yeah, when they're dragging him out of the tub.  That's what I originally thought it was.  Good one.  One of the best lines ever was uttered just before he went on the air.  What?  The E-Rock.  We have to start with that.  E-Rock?  Who asked if he was wearing a hairpiece?  Steve.  Oh, for Jesus.  Was it Steve?  Yeah.  Why? 
[00:08:00]  Wearing a hairpiece.  And everyone's running in.  One day, he decided not to wear a hat.  And Steve goes, Eric, are you wearing a hairpiece?  Oh, that's right.  Isn't that weird when you go out without a hat sometimes?  Well, you have a lot of hair, which is a good thing.  It just looks like you should be in one of those commercials coming out of a pool, though.  Yeah, it's all puffy.  Hawks, wigs.  Don't come off.  I'd like to choke him with the phone cord.  I hope he laughs.  You're going to talk to Nathaniel Bryant like that? 
[00:08:30]  Wig-wearing douche.  It looks like the whole front of your head should be gone, like the hair there.  Opie, Opie, I'll give you the sound clip.  I'll give you the sound clip.  Give him the fucking sound clip, Hawk.  You got any mayonnaise?  I want to bring some for Belle.  And the pictures are up on opieandanthony.com to check it out for yourself.  Oh, it's awful.  It is really strange.  I know that's your real hair, but you might want to think about a different haircut or something.  But, like, it's way too, like, short up in there. 
[00:09:00]  And the back, it stiffens in the back like a wig will tend to do.  Right, right, right.  It stiffens.  It doesn't touch your neck gracefully.  All right.  So, we had fun with that about a half hour ago here.  That's right.  Fucking Joe Dirt.  Got to welcome Jimmy back.  Well, yeah, he's got the Joe Dirt beginner thing going on.  Yeah, sound like a quarter mullet.  It's awful.  All right, let's go right to the phone and say hi to Anthony in Boston.  Anthony.  Hello. 
[00:09:30]  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Am I right?  I thought maybe the phones didn't work.  That scared me.  Steve in Indiana.  Steve.  Yes, sir.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, man.  I listened to you guys for the first time Wednesday, man.  You guys are hilarious.  And I usually do, like, gift certificates.  I went out and bought four of the Delphi Rody XTs for four people that I'm going to give presents to this year.  Oh, good.  I'm not doing gift certificates.  I'm doing X-Men's, man.  Oh, right on, man.  That's what people need to do this Christmas. 
[00:10:00]  Thank you, sir.  This is a holiday season.  Great, man.  Where's the Patrice guy?  Well, no, there's another guy named Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Wait, how long have you been listening?  Wednesday was my first episode.  All right.  This is actually my fourth day.  This is the oddest thing with this program.  Sir, you've been listening for, like, four days or so.  And now this new guy, this new kid, Jimmy Norton, is sitting in for our third mic, Patrice O'Neal.  You like Patrice, right? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, Patrice, he went to film a movie or something, so we got this guy, Jim Norton.  Yeah, he'll be sitting in for Patrice O'Neal.  Yeah, he's filming a movie.  It's a sequel with Peter Jackson.  Right.  So, like, how long is this Jimmy guy sitting in for Patrice?  Maybe two or three weeks.  Patrice comes back January 9th for three weeks.  Patrice is back.  Is that it?  Okay.  Yeah.  He's actually the regular guy.  I come in and fill in when he's away or in some sort of a diabetic coma. 
[00:11:00]  This is awful because these new people that are coming on board have no clue what this show has been for over a year now.  Sir, Jimmy Norton is the guy.  He's the third guy on this show.  He has been since we were at our old radio station when we got the boot from there.  And when we came on here at XM, it's been Opie Anthony and Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy just recently got a part in an HBO TV series.  So he's been in L.A. filming it. 
[00:11:30]  And we've had other comics sitting in.  Bill Burr has done a great job for us.  And Patrice O'Neal of late has done fantastically.  But you seem to be under the illusion that Patrice is our third guy.  But he isn't.  So you've got to get used to Jimmy.  That's right.  Because when push comes to shove down the road, it's going to be Jimmy Norton sitting there.  Until he leaves us for something else.  Until some other fucking coattail comes along that he figures he could profit off of more than this program. 
[00:12:00]  I really am like a surfer from coattail to coattail.  I just hop on.  I don't even fall off.  And then as he's, figuratively speaking, fucking these other women, we're paying his rent.  Which is just great.  It is nice of you.  But I always come back with my mouth at the ready.  I never turn you down.  Jim, you've got big shoes to fill, man.  All right, Steve.  Thanks.  Steve in Indiana, everyone.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, John.  Lil Conner, what's up, buddy? 
[00:12:30]  Welcome back.  Oh, thank you, fella.  Hey, listen, Jimmy, I love you, bro.  But I've got to tell you, fellas, I've listened to Patrice at least four times over the weekend on the replay.  That story that he told.  Yeah, did he hear about the story he told?  I've known it a few years.  No, I know, but he told it on the radio.  Guys, I've got to tell you, every time you listen to it, man, it's just, it's out of control, man.  You know what made it so good is Opie didn't say anything for like 15 minutes, bro.  Nah, you've got to know when to shut the fuck up, man.  Great stuff, man. 
[00:13:00]  Great.  He was, Jimmy, I've got to tell you, bro, I met you, but he killed.  He killed.  Of course he did.  He's funny.  I thought that, all right, when Patrice went into that story, I thought it was going to have a cute, happy ending.  I thought, you know, it was going to be one of those, wow, something almost happened to me.  I thought he was going to maybe talk about Keith.  Yeah, let me tell you, man, how close I came to having my life wrecked.  And then all of a sudden he's choking up and I actually see his eyes getting all like moist.  A little misty.  I go, you didn't, you didn't get off. 
[00:13:30]  He goes, no.  And then goes into the story.  Holy crap.  It was one of the first times that and I just sat there and just stared for like 20 minutes.  Yeah.  20 minutes.  Had nothing to say.  Just had to watch him and, and listen to that story.  It was, uh, it was awful.  Yeah.  I know.  It is really, I didn't think he'd ever tell that on the air actually.  Boston Justice.  Oh, you heard that one already?  For years.  Yeah.  But I mean, it was something that he was, I don't know if he was consciously like, he never said, don't tell people.  I just, you know, never tell people. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  I think he was more concerned about it affecting his career or something, which I think is ridiculous.  Yeah.  His fucking horrible attitude and bridge burning behavior wrecks his career.  Yeah.  What does he care about that for?  I watched the, uh, I was going through my computer last night, just cleaning out old videos and shit like that.  And I came across the video that they played at the beginning of Patrice's roast.  It's hysterical.  All the comics just bashing him.  You gotta, I guess I'll get that to Steve and he could put it up online, but it's so goddamn funny.  That's a great idea.  And one guy at the end just goes, Patrice, two words, fat nigger. 
[00:14:30]  It's like, wow.  Oh my God.  Just brutal.  Fucking brutal.  Now, one guy had a nice thing to say.  It's just awful.  And Bill Burr's sitting there, Patrice, I don't know, words come to mind, fucking hack.  He's just bashing him on mine.  Uh, oh my God, we can't do this.  Bill in Texas.  Bill.  Bill.  Yes, sir.  How y'all doing?  Hey, Bill.  I have a request.  Yes.  Oh, all right.  I'm from Texas and some of us newer listeners don't have a clue about anything y'all have 
[00:15:00]  ever done.  Yeah.  How long have you been listening?  Uh, probably about a month.  Okay.  A month.  Fuck.  And I always hear the talk about y'all getting run off or fired from the other radio station.  I have no idea what happened and it's killing me to know.  Are you kidding me?  Well, that's an oldie.  That's a big one.  That was, uh...  Everybody probably knows they lived in New York, but there's guys from everywhere else  around the country.  I have no idea.  I've never even heard of y'all, but I got, I found this station.  Well, sir, what happened was, um, there was a contest that they had, uh, it was sponsored 
[00:15:30]  by a beer company.  It was, um, who could fuck a baby the fastest?  And Ope thought he could, Dan thought he could, and it turns out it was a tie.  I think as time has gone on, Jimmy's forgotten the gist of the story.  Well, actually...  They were cute children.  They never should have been fired.  And, you know, truth be told, it was just me and a bonnet.  You know what, fellas, maybe I'll explain one day for me.  Bill, you got a computer? 
[00:16:00]  Uh, yes, sir.  All right, two things for the new listeners.  There's a website called oavirus.com, has all our old bits, running like 24 hours a day,  pretty much.  You can download whatever the hell you want.  And then, uh, whackbag.com is a great, uh, fan site.  And they answer a lot of those questions in one of their forums, okay?  All right, fellas, I appreciate it.  All right, Bill, thanks.  Appreciate it.  A lot of people, uh, don't know.  They just, they came on recently.  I've noticed a jump.  A jump in listenership, Opie. 
[00:16:30]  But they are new people.  Yeah.  That now are like, all right, funny man.  All right, there, uh, entertain me.  Why did we try so hard for the last year?  We should have coasted for a year.  We could have started right now.  All our stuff right now.  Pump it out.  Let's make believe we haven't done anything.  So everything's new again.  And the second we even touch on a subject that we've touched on before,  e-mails and instant feedbacks from people that have been there since day one.  Oh, this again.  This stupid story? 
[00:17:00]  I think you're a second idiot.  The Opie typing guy.  One finger punch.  I think you guys, because he's too stupid to type it.  When are you guys going to stop calling it in?  Guys, how about something new for once?  We heard that.  Boring!  Yeah.  My favorite.  The Y, 20 As, 20 Ws, and an N.  Yeah.  When that comes through in caps on instant feedback, it is an instant banning. 
[00:17:30]  Instantly you are banned.  I don't care if you're joking.  I didn't want to see JK at the end of that one.  Unless there's a slash in between the two, because that makes it all fun.  He's just kidding.  LOL.  I like to put a little semicolon and a half a parenthesis.  Look, it's a wink on the side.  Rolling on floor, sucking dad's cock.  Lying on the side.  Maybe you're either winking or having a stroke and laying on the floor.  No one to pick you up, is there?  Bye-bye, left side of the body. 
[00:18:00]  Jeff in Kentucky.  Jeff, better learn to play patty cakes on your thigh.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, Jimmy, I tell you what, welcome back, birthday boy.  And I just want to tell you, I don't care what anybody says, nobody will be able to fill your shoes.  Nobody does it better.  Well, thanks, mister.  I heard Patrice was great.  I didn't hear the show as much as great.  Patrice, fantastic.  Yeah, Patrice did great for us in your absence.  A lot of people welcoming you back, Jimmy.  Thank you.  No, it is.  It's a different head for the show. 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  It's like, it's a different attitude.  It's the same show, but we take different directions with other people.  That's kind of odd, you know?  It really is weird.  You sit there, it's the show like we've been used to it for years.  AIDS, The Shining, repeat.  Child abuse.  Patrice comes on, it's black issues and women stink on ice.  And Bill Burr comes in and I got to bite my tongue not to say anything about black people. 
[00:19:00]  For some reason, the palest white guy ever is the one that gets the most offended by any type of racial humor.  Does he really?  Yeah.  I've noticed that, too, yeah.  I think it's because he likes to date black women.  Yes.  So, like, that kind of filters in.  When Patrice is here, it's, motherfucking nigga, motherfucking nigga, motherfucking nigga.  Right.  What about Voss when he's filling in?  Well, those are the days where the listeners call up and go, why are you phoning it in today? 
[00:19:30]  Those are the days where I want to call Ben and go, Ben, I'm sick today.  I can't make it in.  The Voss, oh wait, are you talking Voss and Bonnie?  I have nothing against Bonnie, but it hasn't just been Voss.  It's the Voss and Bonnie show now.  In a long time.  Now, Bonnie's great.  She's very funny.  And I love when she smashes Voss right in the face.  It's hysterical.  But Voss is so pussy whipped now, he cannot go even on radio shows without Bonnie with a man. 
[00:20:00]  Having a wife who's your best friend is great, but Voss has given up his identity as just a nobody on his own.  Yeah.  Now he's just a nobody with a funny wife.  Rich McFarlane.  Yep.  That's it.  Everyone jokes about it, but.  Let's go to Fatty.  Fatty.  Fatty.  Yo, what's up, boys?  What's up, Fatty?  Hi, Fatty.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Welcome back.  Thank you very much.  It is my birthday, and I appreciate you remembering.  No problem.  Hey, guys, what did you think of the rally on Friday?  We had a fucking awesome time.  I got to tell you, we had so much fun on Friday.  I was exhausted from Friday's show. 
[00:20:30]  You guys really came through big time.  I want to thank the O&A Army and all the pests out there.  Not only did they show up in numbers on a very cold and rainy morning.  Yes.  They did a great job.  They behaved themselves.  They were smart.  They were clever.  They got the word out.  I couldn't be prouder of the display that we had on Friday.  I got to tell you, I really was scared going into it.  I thought, you know, you guys were going to fuck it up.  I thought the pests were going to fuck it up with the O&A Army and something stupid was  going to happen. 
[00:21:00]  But I'm starting to realize that these guys are a lot smarter than I gave them credit  for.  Well, some of them.  The general man did a fabulous job.  He was awesome.  No, I think they all behaved.  I mean, you know, we could joke about it, but I really think they did a great job on  Friday.  And if you look at the pictures and the videos on our website, I mean, it's unbelievable.  We were all over the place on Friday.  And who was so pissed off?  Of course he was.  When that bus made the turn.  Did you guys check that out or what?  From 57th.  We checked out everything, buddy.  Down Broadway, it was just a line of the yellow and black O&A signs. 
[00:21:30]  He's waving, but it was all just O&A people.  Was he on a bus?  Like an outdoor bus?  One of those big double-decker and went out the top bus, taking him down.  And he turns that corner and it's nothing but a sea of O&A guys with the signs and everything.  And he's waving, but oof, oof, you just know he was pissed off.  I saw photos.  It's nice to see we have some power behind this show. 
[00:22:00]  Because the one thing with the old show on commercial radio when we got fucked, we had a huge audience,  but we didn't have anything organized behind the scenes.  And I think in the end that really messed us up too, you know?  We've got to show these people we have power.  We've got to show the corporate sponsors we have power.  We've got to show the company we have power.  We've got to show our enemies we have power.  Then we get the women.  We have to, though.  You know, because that's what shuts down radio shows all the time.  It's one dumb letter from one stupid group.  Well, it's time that we show that we're a group and we're powerful as well instead of just doing a silly radio show. 
[00:22:30]  I understand that.  I'm sorry, but there was a letter that came in this morning about Eric from the organization of people who can spot wigs from across the street.  Dude, there is something going on.  I swear to God, it looks like the front of your head is snapped on.  Your fucking perforated hairdo is really bugging everybody.  It really is bothering us all.  Old cardboard hair.  Can we shave your head today?  Sure, go ahead.  Sure, go ahead.  All right, get the clippers.  Why would you do that?  Yeah, why would you do that?  Can we buzz it?  Let's go to Big Ass Member. 
[00:23:00]  Bam, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm so sick from last week.  We had so much fun that I can barely talk anymore.  Oh, so who gave us the sore throat?  Because my throat is killing me today.  Yeah.  Anthony says he's got a little scratch going on.  God, it's a little scratch.  He's been there all weekend.  Take some emergency and some zinc.  I've been taking everything.  The emerging dash C.  Oh, how clever.  Yeah.  Jimmy gave me some of that this morning.  I've been taking that airborne stuff.  What the fuck is that airborne stuff?  And does it work?  No, it stinks.  Take the zinc lozenges. 
[00:23:30]  No, no, no.  What?  The throat coat.  It's called.  It's an herbal, like, slippery elm bark thing.  Yeah, no, I've taken that before.  But I'm saying zinc lozenges.  When you feel a cold, like when you first get a twinge, like a little, you fucking start  taking the zinc lozenges.  And they're fantastic.  Yes.  And coldies.  I just think I have a sore throat from yelling.  Everyone has a remedy.  It's bullshit.  Yeah.  Trust me.  I just know I got a sore throat and I'm going to be fucked for the rest of the week.  We can listen to a guy who yelled once on a Friday or someone that's eaten the asses 
[00:24:00]  of many prostitutes and very rarely gets sick.  You've built up an immunity.  Good point.  Jimmy did get the ass flu once.  He did right after eating a girl's ass.  Not just a girl.  She became beyond famous after Jimmy was with her.  Yep.  Inside edition can't get enough of her.  They're doing stories on her almost daily.  Are they still talking about her?  It's unbelievable how many stories they did on her.  Anyway, Bamb, great job.  I wanted to go on Whackbag and write a little something something to thank all you guys. 
[00:24:30]  So maybe you can pass the word on for me.  Absolutely.  Did you guys see the WB news reports?  I sure did.  You did a good job with that.  Yes, sir.  WB was the only one that covered our side of the story, which is fine.  We got some coverage.  That's all that matters.  Don't just needle in his side or whatever the saying is.  I'm fucking boss this morning.  A thorn?  A thorn in his side.  That's it.  Yes.  A needle in his side.  You guys did great, and I want to just thank the PES again and the O&A Army.  Great job.  Anytime.  All right, bro.  We're waiting for orders.  All right.  Thanks, Bamb.  Bye, sweetie. 
[00:25:00]  Bye-bye.  Sweetie.  Yeah, what's going on with that?  That's adorable.  So you can see the pictures and videos.  They're up on opianathony.com.  Tomorrow's a big day.  Speaking of the PES and the Army, you've got to help us get the word out.  Tomorrow we're doing our radio show in the afternoon.  Oh, we haven't had enough.  I forgot about this.  Wait a minute.  Let me bask in this joy.  Holy shit, I'm getting drunk tonight.  I'm going out and just partying.  I want 3 o'clock in the afternoon tomorrow to seem like 5 a.m. 
[00:25:30]  If that's what I'm going to do, screw it all up.  So you guys get to...  See, I get to get up early.  For what?  For what?  My little thorough movie audition.  Oh.  Is this C?  Trying to keep that secret?  That didn't work.  No.  What do you think?  We don't know about that, Tom.  What?  I got to tell you about every audition?  I turned it down.  You have an audition tomorrow for that?  Yeah.  I got to go today to see the Bob Krakauer acting coach so I can fucking learn.  Instead of doing it with my eyes wide open again.  So that'll be another Martha Tui Lose You. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, Will, how are you?  Will, Will.  What's the premise of this movie?  It's about ice skaters and I play a gay stalker.  A guy who...  I only have like one scene, but it's a guy who like really has like a crush on, I think  it's Will Ferrell's character.  Yeah.  And I kind of creep him out.  Of course you do.  Wow, you don't even need this.  Isn't that what you do in every role you play?  Yeah.  All right, we need a creepy guy.  Yeah.  I actually say that in auditions.  Jim Norton type.  Why are you auditioning?  You don't...  You should just get the role. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know if I can play this one.  I'll try.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, but here...  Tomorrow morning, good luck to you.  Yeah, good luck to you.  Here's the deal.  Homeless shopping spree...  Another six months, we don't see them.  Homeless shopping spree goes down tomorrow.  We haven't had a lot of time to promote this thing.  It's going to be at the Palisade Center Mall in West Nyack, New York.  We're encouraging the army to show up, the pass, wear your t-shirts and all that because  we want to get the XM word out to that mall because there's going to be a lot of people  shopping.  I've heard one really, really good thing about this mall.  I've heard a lot of good things, but one really, really good thing. 
[00:27:00]  It's a big mall and they have rides.  They have like a little Ferris wheel, little bike, merry-go-round and all that fun shit  for our homeless guys.  The pictures will be great.  Golden buns, I want to ride on the merry-go-round.  I want to sing on the stage.  A disgusting ass jerk-off.  Please stand in line for a Santa picture. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  We've got to have that.  Dirty animals.  Sits on Santa's lap, leaves a big brown stain on Santa's red pants.  Disgusting.  We love the Homeless shopping spree.  You've got to see some of the guys that are going on this one, Jimmy.  We met a guy called Half a Hulk Face.  Oh, did you see?  God, Jimmy doesn't know Half a Hulk Face.  You don't know half the shit that has happened in the last couple of weeks.  Pull up a picture, Hawk.  Pull up a picture of Half a Hulk Face.  He's going to be doing the Homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  Then we've got this really horny, perverted, Colombian guy. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  He's been arrested numerous times for jerking off in front of women.  He goes out.  He gets behind, like, a corner.  Look.  We give you Half a Hulk Face, Jimmy.  Half a Hulk Face.  Ew.  It's as if.  It's as if.  And that isn't even the side where you can see his ear,  which is drooping down to his neck.  Show him the ear.  It looks like he got half angry.  And, like, it just stopped. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, my God.  This guy's a classic.  He could hear his armpit hair growing.  What's wrong with him?  It's a tumor.  It's a tumor.  It got the tumor.  In his face?  In his face.  They can't operate on it.  They can't operate on it.  No, why?  Because he has no money.  Yeah, it's because he's got no money.  If he had money, he could look relatively normal.  Because people photoshopped his good half onto his bad half,  and saw what he would look like, kind of normal.  And he just looks like an average dude.  He would look all right.  But now he's Half a Hulk Face.  He was all stretched down.  Yeah.  So we call him Half a Hulk Face.  Like, he's sort of agitated. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Like, he was trying to change his tire, like David Banner,  and he bashed his knuckles, but it wasn't too bad.  Yeah.  Ow!  He lost a couple of lug nuts, and he was like,  Oh, here they are.  Half a Hulk Face.  Half a Hulk Face will be at the homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  He really should go to a makeup place and ask what they can do for him.  Yeah.  Some cover-up.  Oh, just go to send him.  Yes.  Send him to get some blush and some ruch.  Dude, that's the best.  Send him to, like, the Macy's makeup thing, 
[00:29:30]  where they put on the blush and the ruch and give him a makeover.  Yeah.  Hey, could you do something with this?  You have to back up a truck with a fucking...  We'll send you to the craftsman's apartment for a sawzall  and take care of half a Leno chin.  The problem is he doesn't have a sense of humor, really.  No?  We could do so much with him, but he's a very serious dude.  Every time he laughs, his fucking ear drops a quarter inch.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Old tumor cheeks.  So let's get the word out.  Q-tips and jabs himself in the Adam's apple. 
[00:30:00]  Q-tips.  Q-tips.  Only when you're here, you fuck.  Why can't I speak?  We've been flawless for two weeks.  Flawless.  I defy you to find a flaw.  That's right.  Since Jimmy's been gone.  Absolutely flawless.  None of us.  Anyway, homeless shopping spree tomorrow.  Palisades Center Mall, West Nyack, New York.  We're doing the show live tomorrow afternoon from 3 to 7, East Coast time, okay?  We're going to bring a bus filled with New York City's finest homeless people to the Palisades  Mall in West Nyack, and we encourage all our listeners to stop on by, wearing your T-shirts 
[00:30:30]  and stuff, and follow the homeless around as they do their shopping.  Half all the face.  Half all the face.  That's right.  Oh, he's a silly goose.  Yeah, there was something.  Is that stinky-ass broad going to be there, too?  Oh, uh, what's her name?  Donna?  Donna.  Donna the homeless whore?  Homeless, uh...  Homeless prostitute?  She got completely naked.  She sucks dick for like five bucks.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Wait, Jimmy didn't see her either?  I don't think so. 
[00:31:00]  She went Bill Smelder butt?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  The reek coming up.  And we got to get them into the clothing stores where they shed some of the jackets they're wearing  to really get that fragrance going and have them try on suit jackets and whatnot.  You ever have a Hulk face, you should go and try sunglasses on.  Anything that goes on is awful face.  You should try shades on.  Earmuffs.  iPod.  Yeah.  Try to keep an iPod earbud in that ear.  Yeah.  You're going to need a plunger, a toilet plunger. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, there's so many things to do with it.  Oh, yeah.  For earrings, clip earrings.  Clip on.  Oh, that's horrible.  No Q-Tips.  Taps.  Enough.  All right.  Tripped up a little bit.  That's all right.  Hey, you didn't hear this because you were in L.A.?  Rob Bartlett from Imus' show gave you a little something-something on the show.  I didn't hear it, but I saw the photo of him wearing an Eat a Bullet shirt, which was  just fucking great. 
[00:32:00]  And he had this to say.  Now, Brian Wilson, I see, is here with an Eat a Bullet dot com t-shirt on.  What the hell does that mean?  What do you think it means, Opie?  Why don't you heed the advice?  Wow.  You know how great that is?  I think he describes it.  This next clip's long.  We'll just play a part of it because it's just a part about you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  And as I mentioned, Brian Wilson is here and wearing an Eat a Bullet dot com t-shirt.  Where is that from? 
[00:32:30]  Some guy's on Opie and Anthony's show, right?  It's little Jimmy Norton's website, Opie.  And it's his birthday.  It is?  Yes.  Happy birthday to little Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  What does he do?  Is he a comedian?  He's a comedian.  He's on HBO and Opie and Anthony's show, which you should know.  I do know.  I'm just kind of playing along here.  I get it, Opie. 
[00:33:00]  Actually, Rob accused me yesterday of having never listened to Opie and Anthony.  Really?  He said, when did you actually ever listen to Opie and Anthony?  I said, well, one day we're on NAW.  I told you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they're not any different now, are they?  No.  Except they don't have any commercials.  Well, they have some commercials, but not a lot of commercials.  It's not like, you know, Howard Stern.  Right.  He's got 9,000 commercials.  Right.  And then he complains for two minutes about how much radio sucks and then there's another 9,000 commercials. 
[00:33:30]  It's kind of like you, except instead of complaining about radio sucks, you complain your back hurts.  My back doesn't hurt.  Today.  Yeah.  Except I like Opie and Anthony because, I don't know.  Well, I mean, they're funny.  What am I going to tell you?  And I like Opie.  I feel like I have to apologize for this.  It's just awful.  We should just stop it there.  He just makes me laugh, dude.  It really hurt that he didn't know who I was. 
[00:34:00]  It just goes on and on and on and on and on and they never really get to a point on that one.  So, anyway.  It's just funny, though, that he just starts playing along.  Yes.  I wish he knew who I was.  Okay.  He doesn't.  Thank you, Rob.  We got the fake firefighter.  Yeah.  I guess the whole country was in on this story, huh?  Yeah.  This guy dressed up like a firefighter here in New York.  It's like a month ago already.  Something like that.  Two months ago.  Two months?  Because it was right around Halloween.  Yeah.  Oh, exactly.  And he started a little fire in this building. 
[00:34:30]  He goes to a woman's door that he'd been stalking for a while.  Knox says he's a fireman.  She looks through the peephole.  He's dressed like a fireman.  She opens the door.  He comes in and for the next nine hours or so proceeds to just rape her as the real firemen show up because there's a fire.  But he just kept her in there and raped her, left, and they've been looking for him ever since.  And they found him in Memphis?  He had no money.  He was selling his blood to try to make us some money, and they caught him. 
[00:35:00]  He said, I'm the guy you're looking for, and proceeded to stab himself in the neck.  Slice.  Yeah, but I don't even think he really did a serious job at it.  Did you see the blood in the paper?  Yeah.  Over the weekend?  Look, he's there with a little bandage on.  He was in critical condition on the, you know, he was bleeding.  He was bleeding to death, and they saved him.  They show the staples in one of the pictures.  Yeah.  It's a pretty bad slash, to be honest with you.  Why would you save him?  Just let him do it.  Just stab yourself in the neck.  Maybe that'll do it more than a slice on the side. 
[00:35:30]  It looked like he just went for a major slice, but I...  The guy should have done it.  They did say he was stabbing himself in the neck.  Oh, that would have been great.  Yeah, then you saved the taxpayers a lot of money.  Right.  There you go.  Lay there.  All right.  Take care.  Everyone knows what he did.  Yeah.  Just die already.  Well, here's how it was reported on the news this morning.  The story of the stalking and sexual attack on a woman who lives here in Chelsea gripped  the public's attention for weeks.  And now the main suspect in that case, Peter Bronstein, sits in jail awaiting extradition  and arraignment. 
[00:36:00]  This after an apparent suicide attempt that saw him, according to sources, claiming to be  the man the world was looking for.  The hunt for the prime suspect in the notorious Halloween sex attack in Chelsea came to an  end on Friday.  That's when Peter Bronstein, the man police say dressed as a firefighter to gain his victim's  trust, stabbed himself in the neck when he was confronted by a police officer at the  University of Memphis.  He pepper sprayed him.  The guy kept walking like nothing was going on.  And eventually the guy turned his back to the cop and stabbed himself in the right side 
[00:36:30]  of his throat.  He went down, started bleeding everywhere.  Right side of the throat, is that where the jugular is?  Or is it on both sides?  Both.  It's both, right?  Yeah.  You could take your pick.  The 42-year-old former fashion writer was charged with sexual abuse, kidnapping and robbery  yesterday after recovering from the wounds of his apparent failed suicide attempt.  He was transferred from a hospital to a Memphis County jail.  His bond set at a million dollars.  Bronstein now faces extradition to New York. 
[00:37:00]  It's a relief that it's over.  Alberto Bronstein had pleaded with his son to turn himself in.  His son's capture is the dramatic end to sightings of him in the last several weeks.  Sightings that saw police swarm city neighborhoods.  Sources say Bronstein's time on the lam included stops in Ohio, then Tennessee.  And while Bronstein faces the Chelsea charge here and faces arraignment for that, he's also  been charged with assaulting a police officer in Memphis.  He has a court date scheduled for later this week for that charge, we believe. 
[00:37:30]  However, if he waives his right to fight the extradition to New York, that Tennessee  charge could be dropped and he might be extradited to the state that much sooner.  Well, he got what he wished.  A lot of fame.  A lot of press.  That seems to be what he's into.  A lot of press and a lot of fame.  Handcuffed, sporting a navy blue prison scrub.  The bloated, puffy-faced freelance writer.  Yeah, looks like he had no problem eating on the lamb.  On the lamb.  He was eating the lamb.  Oh, but he wasn't.  Oh, he balked at seeing his elderly father, but then broke into a broad smile when prison 
[00:38:00]  marshals asked him if he wanted to talk to reporters.  Hey, man.  The 42-year-old former woman's Wear Daily media reporter said.  Jesus, what a title.  I know.  Everyone needs a title if you make the papers.  Wearing a bandage on the right side of his neck.  He said, I'm good.  He began walking away as reporters asked if they could talk to him.  Not right now.  To be honest, I'm a little out of it, but maybe tomorrow.  They said, you're looking good. 
[00:38:30]  He shrugged and gave a half smile.  Like, that's what this guy wants.  He doesn't even care that he's going to be going to prison.  He just wanted this media attention.  This fame.  Jesus.  He'll be doing a ton of stories on him now.  Media.  The jailhouse interview.  All that crap.  His first anal.  All the way.  How'd they know it was him?  His first prison ass raping.  How did they know it was him?  Like, yeah, his name has been in the paper for so long.  What?  How'd they know, like, beforehand?  Did she recognize him, or did they ever say, this is the guy we want? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, I think relatives came through or something.  Oh.  Yeah.  One of ours.  She knew him.  Oh, she knew him.  Is that what you mean?  Yeah, like, all of a sudden, they're like, this is the guy we're looking for.  Yeah, no, she knew him.  I guess they worked together, or they had some kind of connection.  And she knew it was him?  Yes.  Positive.  I remember that part of the story, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Geek.  Someone's saying the jugular's on the left side of the neck.  I asked that, because it looks like he...  Both sides.  Keith and Jersey.  Hey. 
[00:39:30]  Listen.  Listen, the jugular vein is on the left side of your neck, and the carotid artery is on  the right side of your neck.  And I'm not a doctor.  The only reason I know that is in the episode of Star Trek, where Khan was holding the blade  to Dr. McCoy's throat.  He goes, why don't you cut the carotid artery just below the right ear?  Most effective.  That's because he was holding the scalpel to his right ear.  Right.  Like, he could...  If he was holding it to the left, then it would have been the left ear.  I love that Anthony knows that.  Those go up both sides. 
[00:40:00]  We're very symmetrical inside, except for a few things like a stupid appendix.  One draw to the brain, one stroke from the heart.  All right.  Thank you.  I don't know who's right.  It's got to go up both sides, and there's a vein that comes down both sides.  I was asking, because it looks like he thought this out before he slashed his throat, going,  all right, if I slash on this side, it'll be dramatic, a lot of blood, but I'll survive.  I don't know.  Maybe he thought it was easier to pull the knife down if you're right-handed, some kind  of CSI shit. 
[00:40:30]  No, he would have to be left-handed.  Oh, you mean this way he would go?  If you hold the knife so the blade is facing you.  So you go like this.  And you go, wham, you're getting a lot of...  But your example is weird.  Look at the picture.  Yeah.  It should be the other side.  Oh, the other side.  All right, so maybe he's looking at where the blade was facing away from him and did that.  Slice down?  This doesn't seem like...  If you're right-handed...  It just seems like this guy's very calculated.  It should go left to right, and you should pull and just like...  It seems like he's very calculated.  If he really wanted to kill himself in that way, he would have. 
[00:41:00]  It looks like, all right, I'm going to do something very dramatic here.  It's going to get even more press.  Yeah.  And I will survive this slash or whatever.  Like he wasn't going to wait until...  Why did he wait until the cops were on him?  Yeah, exactly.  Do it in a field somewhere where they'll find you a rotting carcass for later.  Fiend, they have him as.  Rant of a fiend.  Yeah, that's on the front page of all the New York papers today.  That's the big story.  And then the other big story in New York is this transit strike.  What the hell's going to happen with that? 
[00:41:30]  Well, it doesn't look good.  But they can't strike.  Like, if they strike, what happens?  I believe the fine is $10,000...  I heard $25,000, but you might be right.  ...per...  Is I'm right, Travis?  Jimmy's right?  Of course Jimmy's right.  It's his first day back.  Jimmy's right.  Everyone's kissing Jimmy's ass.  $25,000 per member, per day.  And it increases, it doubles every day. 
[00:42:00]  That's $50,000 for the second day, so that's $75,000.  Dude, after like three or four months, it's not going to be worth the financial incentive.  That is a lot of money per member.  So, you're talking...  Most of those people can't afford...  $10, $20.  Most of those people can't afford one day's fines.  So, what happens?  I think more than that, Anthony.  A little more than that.  It comes out of the union's till.  Their till doesn't come out personally. 
[00:42:30]  How much money do they have in this till?  Unions are very rich, very wealthy, but it doesn't look good.  They're not talking, they're not getting each other's sides of this whole thing, and it looks like they're fucked.  So, here's a stupid question.  If the unions are so rich and well-off, why don't they take that money and give it to their members?  Well, because they invest it to make more money, and their higher-ups, they draw a pretty large paycheck.  They get a good amount of money. 
[00:43:00]  But who am I to bad-mouth the union?  They're usually a bunch of Italians, and I don't like...  I'm just asking.  I have no idea.  I don't know the unions and the unions.  I don't like bad-mouthing them.  All right.  So, we'll have to wait and see what happens with that.  They're saying the deadline for strike...  Midnight tonight.  Midnight tonight, and that they will not push this off.  That midnight, they are going to strike unless they come to a settlement.  Which means this city is fucked.  Then they would probably say you either waive the fines or you don't go back to work.  And they would waive the fines to get them back within a week or so. 
[00:43:30]  They're not going to fine them that much money.  You can't.  A week or so?  Oh, well, however long it would take, like...  I don't know.  Like, if you're...  You know, before they start hiring new people.  They don't want to train new people.  Well...  Train new people.  I have no idea what I'm talking about.  Funny.  I know.  You really are just...  Oh, L.A. doesn't...  L.A. doesn't have a subway.  No, it's not that they don't, man.  I'm just so busy.  You know, there's a lot of pressure.  Remember the lines.  Smile right.  And that had better be a joke on your fucking jacket.  The fur with the red circle and slash through it. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, I have...  Thank you for reminding me, Anthony.  I want to thank my friends at PETA.  I actually got a nice box from them, which I thought was a joke, which wasn't.  It said, thanks for sticking up for the furry critters.  Why...  When did you stick up for a furry critter?  I guess I'm trash and fur.  That wasn't a pussy.  I didn't realize it.  The seals and stuff.  We had a whole rant.  You had a whole rant about that.  Oh, going out on a limb.  Oh, no, no.  Don't club the baby seals.  Oh, you are a rebel. 
[00:44:30]  Seals are faggots.  I was talking...  And penguins, I kick their stomachs and I laugh about it later.  I was talking...  When they take those flippers, hold their stomach and go...  Oh, I'm pregnant.  Oh.  And they bend and they can't bend because they're fucking bowling pins.  They don't have a...  That vertebrae doesn't have, like, bendability.  Yeah.  A good kick, right?  That little fat penguin stomach.  They all got pot bellies.  Yeah, I know.  Little fat, starving children bodies.  Little Brent Mertz bodies.  I forgot what it was, but you were sticking up for... 
[00:45:00]  There was an article in the New York Post by some woman who was, like, just talking about  how she likes fur because it's glamorous.  Oh, yeah.  And I really, really wanted to pull a cape for you.  I wanted to bite her face and laugh.  And she just made me so angry.  So I just talked about how much I hated her guts.  And Peter sent me this stuff.  And I have enough buttons for all the guys.  No fur.  If you think for a second I would wear something like that, a no fur button.  Some really cool guy, I'm trying to get Ben to get him on the phone. 
[00:45:30]  He shot a bear.  A 745-pound black bear.  I want to see if we can get him on the phone.  That's pretty cool.  Is Ben trying to get him on the phone?  I think so, yeah, man.  New Jersey Hunter takes down record 745-pound beast.  He grins and bears it.  See how funny the paper can be if you give him a chance?  Unbelievable.  What was he using?  Does it say?  Bow?  Pistol?  Rifle?  What did he have?  I don't know if it meant...  Hold on.  I saw some guy in a magazine downed a huge bear with his pistol. 
[00:46:00]  Really?  That's some balls, man.  Who bagged the biggest black bear in state history, brought him down with one shot, and  then spent hours hauling the 745-pound beast out of the woods.  He shot him in a project in Newark, though, which was the...  No?  And then he spent hours dragging it out.  Hours dragging it out?  Can you imagine?  You drag it a half a foot, rest.  You gotta.  Half a foot, rest.  Half a foot, rest.  Repeat, repeat, repeat. 
[00:46:30]  You have to understand, a bear this size for me is a once-in-a-lifetime trophy, said  Utter.  His last name's Utter.  54, an electrical and excavation contractor who has shot three other bears, two in Canada  and one in New Jersey.  He loves shooting bear.  So, there you have it.  It stood nine feet tall.  Did it get up on two legs?  Roar!  And then he bagged it.  And that's the record for New Jersey.  The previous record was 675 pounds. 
[00:47:00]  Pete, I'm sure, is very upset with that.  Jimmy, comment?  I was too busy looking at that.  I'm sure they are.  I don't know.  I just think it's pretty cool that he did it.  And it's funny, because if he calls as a bear, I wonder if there's any other bears that  might call him.  Might actually call him?  Say hello to him.  In another room?  Maybe.  I guess we gotta talk to this hunter today, so we'll try to get him on the phone.  We'll see what happens with that.  Get him on the phone.  I read about Elton John's marriage. 
[00:47:30]  Huh?  I was reading about Elton John's marriage.  That sham.  Well, yeah.  What the hell is that?  Yes.  Well, I'm just trying to think of the guy, David Furnish, who's banging Elton John.  Oh.  Who, gay or straight, you can't blame him.  Sir Elton's got a lot of cash.  Of course he does.  I'd roll on my face and take that awful body like mine on top of me.  No, you know Elton's a bottom.  Coincidentally, Elton John has the same hairdo as our own E-Rock.  As well as the same sexual lifestyle.  I guess.  Here comes the Photoshop.  That's right. 
[00:48:00]  You really do have the same hair as Elton John there, you're right.  That's right.  And everyone knows Elton's is as fake as it comes.  You really do have an Elton John there, stupid.  I should move to Windsor and blow someone.  You're right.  Sir Elton probably has a little fat feet back while fucking David Furnish has to close his  eyes and pretend it's anyone but Elton.  Give us a rendition of Candle in the Wind, will you?  This is Uncle Cattle in the Wind.  Candle in the Wind. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  Well, I wanted to hear some of that.  It was about...  Seems to me, you live your life with a dick right up your ass.  I'm surprised he hasn't done a version of this song for me.  Goodbye, dignity.  I have HIV.  Get my robe out of the closet.  Thanks for the robe jokes.  Make me some soup.  You better make that broth. 
[00:49:00]  And please watch my dog, because I'm not strong enough to do it for sale.  Where's that dust buster?  I sneezed and a couple of teeth fell out and hit the floor.  What rhyme is that?  Your rhymes stink.  It's still funny, but your rhymes stink.  Someone has to call you out on that.  There's too many words. 
[00:49:30]  That's great.  My T-cells ever did.  My candle burned out long before the tissues ever did.  Still half a box.  Bye-bye now.  Sponsor thank you to Kleenex.  That's going to be a lovely ceremony.  Do you take this?  You may suck the bride's cock.  That's great. 
[00:50:00]  I heard Elton had to rob a bank to get David Furnish a sex change operation.  He was singing Attica.  You let die, Elton.  You're boring everyone around you with your faggotty music.  I'm surprised he didn't do a version of this for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  I think it's time for another version of this from Elton John.  How many versions did he do?  Goodbye, Superdome.  You smell like shit and... 
[00:50:30]  He originally did one for Ryan White, right?  Did he do it for Ryan White?  He just kind of sang it at Ryan's.  And then he did the Lady Di version, yeah.  Poor Ryan White.  Didn't even get to have any fun.  Yeah.  Got that through a transfusion.  What an awful way to get the AIDS.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Getting a dick in the ass is better?  Sleeping out?  If it's something you enjoy.  Yeah, really.  Is there a good way to get it?  I'm sorry.  I didn't have the luxury of having his feet behind his ears.  I don't know.  I got a drink and a tasty vanilla malt. 
[00:51:00]  It is usually a bad thing.  Okay, you're right.  I prefer it, actually, over a transfusion, as opposed to you, who's upset that he missed  all the joy of having another man's cock slam into him while they maintain eye contact,  neither one having shaved in a few days.  Good point, Jimmy.  Good point.  Good point.  Bastard.  Well, let's say hi to Chris in the Poconos.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys, man.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  What is up with Jim Norton? 
[00:51:30]  He goes to freaking LA now.  He's a granola-eating faggot.  No.  He's going against the burner.  I've never liked it.  Dude, I've actually never liked it.  I've never liked it.  LA has nothing to do with it, dude.  I've never liked it.  Oh, my God.  Why is that a faggot?  He's just kind of...  I think it's stupid.  I don't like it.  I think it's arrogant.  It's arrogant?  Yeah, it just bugs me.  I don't know, man.  I don't know, man.  Yeah, dude, come on.  You're on a national talk show.  I'm kind of the last thing from a...  When Rush Limbaugh gets into these hot topics, he doesn't have a call or go, 
[00:52:00]  I don't know, man.  I don't even know why I'm on the phone.  I just did it because Tommy Lee did it.  All right, I got nothing.  All right.  Thanks, Jim.  That's right.  Say no to her.  Ah, here we go.  Got to get ready for the holidays.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer  Had a very shiny nose  And if you ever saw it 
[00:52:30]  You would even say it glows  One of the other reindeer  Used to laugh and call him names  Names?  They never let poor Rudolph  Join in any reindeer games  Then one foggy Christmas Eve  Santa came to say  Who's buying this shit, Rudolph?  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

[00:58:30]  Thoughts on Christmas  And we'll continue  With the Opinat  That he plays  Merry Christmas  Tonight we celebrate  The birth of the baby  Jesus  Whose mom Mary  Just happens to have  Been a virgin  Even apparently  After she gave birth  To Jesus  At least that's what  The Catholic Church  Would have you believe  You know Tom Cruise  Takes a lot of shit  For belonging to a religion  Scientology  That believes aliens  Came to this planet  75 million years ago  That's nothing  I was raised Catholic  We believe Mary  Was a virgin  And that Jesus 
[00:59:00]  Ended up walking on water  Creating a bottomless  Jug of wine  And rising from the dead  Oh yeah  And Tom Cruise is crazy  Yeah okay  Listen Christmas is built  On a line of bullshit  Okay  Do I believe  There was a baby Jesus  You bet your ass  I do  But I also believe  About nine months  Before he was born  Somebody sure as shit  Bang the hell out  Of his mom  Okay  Oh yeah  And Santa Claus  Well more bullshit  Let me get this straight  A big fat guy  Comes to your house 
[00:59:30]  And leaves you toys  That he and his little  Helpers made  Just for you  And all he asks for  Is a couple of cookies  And a glass of milk  Yeah okay  He sees you when you're sleeping  And he knows when you're awake  Alright he's either a pedophile  Or he's with FEMA  Alright  And if he's with FEMA  He's not showing up  Until January 2nd anyway  So  You know  They lie to us  Right from the get go  And then when we're 12  And we find out the truth  Easter Bunny lie  Tooth Fairy lie  Santa Claus big lie  Then they wonder  Why we start lying  Right back to him  Okay  I'm not drunk  I don't do drugs 
[01:00:00]  I promise I'll pull out  Yeah big lies  Big lies  There's big lies  There's small lies  There's white lies  There's black lies  A white lie  Being when Scooter Libby says  Dick Cheney didn't tell me  What to say  And a black lie  Is when a brother says  I didn't see who shot  Chug Knight  Even though he's sitting  Right next to him  At the party  They're all the same folks  They're all lies  So what did I tell my kids  About the baby Jesus  And his mom  And Santa Claus  That same bunch of bullshit  My parents told me 
[01:00:30]  Why should my kids  Get off easy okay  I want them to experience  The same joy  And cheer  And happiness  I felt as a little kid  And then the crushing blow  Of disappointment  And pain and anger  That comes with getting older  Yes  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Because in the end  All of us know  That's what Christmas  Is really about  A pinch of joy  A pound of pain  A scoop of hatred  And a dollop of rage  Okay  Throw in a little booze  And some relatives  You can't stand the sight of  But you have to invite over anyways  And you've got yourself  A holiday recipe  Chock full of disaster

[01:19:00]  Who must protect a group of cheerleaders  Who have witnessed a murder  Oh my  Great  God  How did that not win  Fantastic  That sounds good  One of the worst movies of the year  Also  Although there's probably some hot cheerleader scenes in there  Yeah  I bet there's some redeeming value  Yeah  They probably dance loads or pom-poms  To make up a funny one  Yeah  Yeah  And then Tommy Lee Jones  They taught him a cheer  Yeah  So he did it to make it really funny  And Cedric was there  When Cedric walked in in the middle of the cheers  And they had to stop it  Because they said  Give me an N  What comes next 
[01:19:30]  Jimmy  What is that  I don't remember  I didn't see the cheer  Okay  After the I  They all just put  It's an A  On the cheer A  I'll have to see that now  Just for that scene  Alright here we go  Seventh worst movie of the year  Fantastic Four  Oh really  It's a  Did you see Fantastic Four  No I didn't

[01:59:00]  there's nothing to bash i mean what are you gonna bash about it completely did what you didn't think  it was gonna do like every time you thought they're going for a hack angle they did the  complete opposite i loved it don cheetle was fantastic the ending was terrific they didn't  they didn't wimp out in the end don cheetle is very underrated he's one of my favorites he's not  underrated he is underrated he was underrated for many years is walking around with an oscar  yeah cheetle isn't he was he was great and sorry he was great and right no he wasn't you didn't see 
[01:59:30]  ray i saw enough trailers you did not have an opinion about ray doing a goddamn impression he was great  though i gotta say he was great give me an award for doing dice he couldn't give me an award for  doing the dice impression he couldn't see he was blind he saw the glasses were fine you could see  right through him no i'm sure he wasn't really blind he had an operation if he gouged his eyes out  before that perhaps we should get some other kind of award not an oscar if anyone be acting he should 
[02:00:00]  not have really be blind don cheetle is a better actor do you know donkey sausage tried to get me  into his birthday party in la who's don cheetle or jamie five foxes and if it turns out i actually  could have went um but i actually it was so late by the time she told me i was on a date now he's  an a-lister and that's always the living shit out of me and the fact that he has like a retarded  sister is like irrelevant i think really according to her yeah i i think the bottom line is that um  i think he's a great actor and that shouldn't be a factor why would you even bring that up

[02:16:00]  movies of the year we've talked about that movie enough uh number four what's it about number four  movie i uh i enjoyed march of the penguins oh that made the top 10 it really is a good movie  is it you and penguins are interesting when there's a goalpost behind them and they're quacking  and you fucking drill your work boot into their fat innocent stomach you know i enjoyed morgan  freeman's narrative yes that was originally some kind of french movie that's right and they pulled 
[02:16:30]  all the dialogue and he sat in a studio and then just read narrated it and uh put it out in america  that's how shitty that is you can just fucking yank the the the narrator and change it and no one  notices no one knows no one cares you kind of feel for the penguins at the end of the year i would  like to take penguins and is there something that would actually paralyze a penguin where he'd still  be alive but completely paralyzed i want to get 10 of them and just paralyze them and then put them in a  pin setter at a bowling alley and have them perfectly set up and see if i could get that the penguin strike 
[02:17:00]  the paralyzed penguin strike how much fun would that be we need one penguin rodney  i got the 710 penguin you know what you do you put him on a little horse with a superman cape  and watch him tumble off and crack his little penguin neck  fucking arrogant little everyone loves the penguin i don't what it is there's no enemy of the penguin 
[02:17:30]  i don't all right except the killer whale but then uh we know that from the movie don't we  what's funny is if a killer whale jumps up and just rips off one penguin foot and then he's got to walk  around yeah and that cold stump number three number three top movies of the year according to the daily  news good night and good luck the george colinney movie that just like making it under the wire i guess  very new movie it's about uh the history of what like radio or is it television television and uh 
[02:18:00]  yeah and some dude that we should know his name edward r murrow oh yeah edward r murrow he's a big  wig in the uh radio business but that was you know something i like george colinney's movies  i like them i liked that um that one they did on uh what's his name from the gong show there chuck  barris oh yes that was fun that was a good movie yeah and then he did that diamond caper movie or  that uh uh uh the oceans 11 yeah and then oceans 12 then they went with oceans 12 which was kind of 
[02:18:30]  cute i thought then he was in that wacky space movie where he was in some spaceship solaris remember  that one yes i have a cricket please thank you i don't own one yeah all right someone wants to  correct you rob in chicago rob yes yes sir hey professor anthony yes i'm surprised you didn't  know this uh they took a lot of heat for it the argentine soldiers during the falklands war  used to take the cute little penguins and slice their bellies open and put their feet at them to 
[02:19:00]  keep them warm who did that the argentine argentine soldiers would use penguins as shoes  i find that so hard to believe that i'm going to call you a liar we're calling bravo sierra rob if  you would please uh instant feedback me in that information so i can ban you i will uh do that  when i get home all right rob thank you i not only believe it but i wish that we could wear them around  here in the streets of new york how cute would that be you just gotta fucking cut their little fat 
[02:19:30]  stomachs open and then tape them closed around your feet while they go wah wah while you'll walk on them  how long will the head flop before it freezes up from rigor you know because as you're walking  you're you're you're putting your foot in that way right where his head is by your toes yeah so his  head's looking up at you so yeah he can almost beg every step he's pleading stop and his head would  be knocking on the street until he just starts like getting a little rigid little cigarette butt stuck in  his wings it starts as comfy slippers and before you know it you're in uncomfortable ski boots yep it's  right like locked on there exactly changeable seem like a good idea about an hour ago i don't think 
[02:20:00]  it's taking off i see your uh coat with the little pita thing has gone off of it it's not on the back  of your uh oh it's not too warm give me a hammer so i could guys we're all gonna be wearing our no  fur buttons peter faggot all right guys the runner-up best movie of the year according to the daily news  here in new york king kong huh haven't seen it yet guess a lot of people went and saw king kong over the  weekend what a disaster this is turning out to be at the box office for this movie they thought 
[02:20:30]  it was going to do a lot better right the first they thought the first wednesday i don't know it  could have been a mistake it only made like 50 million i think they were hoping for for close  to 100 by now you mean opening day on wednesday it made something like eight million or something  like that it's made uh 66 million today 66 million it's been out since wednesday they should have waited  until a weekend for this to open it would have gotten a lot more hype uh i think they would  have gotten a lot more people in there why'd they do it on a wednesday because they're greedy 
[02:21:00]  they want like the big build-up so that by sunday when all the movie totals are out they could say  king kong so far has made this amount what assholes meanwhile the rest of the movie started on friday  uh and now it's kicking them in the reality is it's a good movie but it's not a great movie well  they were predicting it was a past titanic which is they really were and people are like  fuck it i'll wait till get on pay-per-view i was buying the hype i thought it was going to be the  hugest movie ever it's definitely good it's definitely worth checking out but uh 
[02:21:30]  people say a little more time in the editing room might have been uh better for this movie  they left every you gotta have brain they gotta have balls as a director or a studio to put out  a three-hour movie these days you know what with uh lord of the rings movies you look at the audience  you're going for they will sit there if each one of those movies was six hours long the people would  sit there and watch it i understand one of those classic books that a lot of the nerdy guys kind of like  and they would just sit there and watch all the movies in a row uh this movie i don't know three  hours i like a three-hour movie man it's rare but i better move there are uh yeah when they go to 
[02:22:00]  skull island i mean there's definitely some very very good scenes in this movie but then there's some  average scenes at best does he fucker he tries to uh take his pinky yeah but it he wasn't  move it up too far he's like him climbing on top how cool is it like when he climbs after a state  building that's really cool that was really cool yeah that part was very cool and skull island very  very cool what happens at the end does he do better this time i don't think no he does i don't think he 
[02:22:30]  makes it where could he hide he's so big it was beauty killed the beast my friend where do you  hide when you're that big you can't get a room in the city last line of the movie by the way  yeah of course just like the uh beauty that killed the beast like the original and uh they didn't  change it you know what i'm not going to do it i'm not going to ruin the movie for people  what is it oh you're not something dumb that they should have done and uh let me go to john in utah 
[02:23:00]  john what's up oh i just wanted to call you a bastard because i know you i know you were going to do  it you never you never give the the number one of any list and it just drives us ocd people crazy  uh john today i give the number one movie yes of the year we like to be unpredictable on this radio  show giving oh you were expecting me to just pass this on and move on to something else but no today  we give you the best movie of the year according to the daily news and it was my favorite movie of 
[02:23:30]  the year a history of violence oh a movie i told anthony as soon as i saw it i'm like anthony go and  see this tomorrow it's a great movie with vigo vigo vigo's in that vigo vigo mortensen isn't he in  that uh who's vigo vigo right but who is it vigo i don't remember vigo how do you spell it he was in  lord of the rings oh oh that guy yeah yeah gg oh yeah now that i see his picture yes he was in the 
[02:24:00]  movie yes he's like the main guy in it this guy jace is an ass what a history of violence is just a  great movie simple as that uh what's the plot line because it's a it's a movie i don't really want to  based on the graphic novel by john wagner and vince lock a history of violence is the tale of tom  stall tom is a loving family man and well-respected citizen of a small indiana town but when two savage 
[02:24:30]  criminals show up at his diner tom is forced to take action and thwart the robbery attempt suddenly  hurled as a hero who took the courage to stand up to crime people look up to tom as a man of high  moral regard but all that media attention has the killer of mobsters showing up at his doorstep  charging that tom is someone else they've been looking for  is it a case of mistaken identity or does tom have a history that no one knows about either way  someone's about to find out if there's a history of violence oh that is the title the name of that 
[02:25:00]  movie stinks by the way yeah i think a lot more people would have saw this movie if if they didn't  have a confusing uh title they should have called it tom stops a robbery a history of violence  doesn't do this movie justice the name i'm trying to help just trying to help you out here you  should have called that is this the guy or  you know it was a great movie and i can't wait x-men 3 is coming out uh x2 you ever see that no 
[02:25:30]  played a william striker in it was such a good actor uh really made the movie i think it was uh  brian cox that was his name brian cox wonderful in that movie uh  where's the women's list of the the best where's the chick movie list it was in the same paper i want  to see how different their number one is is it the pants movie the sisterhood of the pants jace in 
[02:26:00]  wisconsin jace yeah the reason they're not making any money on king kong is there's too many whipped  assholes like me this old lady figures out that it's like a three-hour fucking movie and they go  well why did i get you a four thousand dollars surround sound system and home theater and  everything it'll be on dvd in two months if you're going to the man wait a minute you're that  pussy whip that your wife told you you couldn't see kong well yeah faggot what well what do you want  me to do man i'm a truck driver i need to get asked somewhere and that's the cheapest why 
[02:26:30]  doesn't she want you to go see the movie because it's three hours she probably didn't want to go to  it because we have no attention span when it comes to stuff like that no no i mean if there was if  there was more you know lovey-dovey kissing and hugging and all that bullshit she'd probably want to  go but you know it's an action movie so you're not going to get abroad to sit there an action movie  for over fifteen minutes so go with your guy friend so you know what it is man it's the title  the title is everything what should they have called to get women to watch it yeah uh the big 
[02:27:00]  monkey likes the girl yeah yeah something like that you know uh kong and his beautiful wife well how  about um um shits the size of a canoe that works big steaming ape logs part do  that's i don't think the chicks are like that jimmy oh you're right that guy's pussy whipped  he really is totally pussy where's the chick list it's right here sweetie all right what's different 
[02:27:30]  about the chick list um well the worst ones are probably just as bad uh i i don't know anything  about she is this number ten is the man which was that samuel jackson movie number nine is ellie  ellie parker which i don't know what that is what i i never saw it as the words are the worst ones  yeah you know she's pretty accurate though because she has like the honeymooners on her list  ah see why wasn't that in the world i wasn't that one of the worst movies of the year yours mine and  ours the thing about my folks what constantine bewitched the brothers grim eon flux and the 
[02:28:00]  exorcism of emily rose i respect the fact that she hated yours mine and ours completely different  movies than um than uh the dudes uh list in in the same that was the bad list the bad list the  honeymooners of course should have been on that list now one movie didn't make uh the top ten movies of  the year walked the line which was amazing i didn't see why is that that was a great movie maybe the 
[02:28:30]  title's wrong uh because you're mine i walked the line yeah my name is sue how do you do  i fell into a burning ring of fire burning ring of fire  all right listen joaquin was not whispering through the nobody knows what it was about movie the village  he's whispering but he wasn't whispering through walk the line he was very good you know i know i  went to see it horrific they didn't know what it was about walk the line yes it's too obscure a title 
[02:29:00]  what what should they have called walk the line um country singer  jimmy you're killing us  all right listen at least they know what they're getting i'm being handful this is how  happen man women just think differently than guys her top ten let me tell you i could do a  whole act on it i already have a bit on that how new york and l.a are different cats and dogs 
[02:29:30]  her top ten favorite movies of the year yeah only one is in the same list as the guy that's  probably just to be different too they probably did that on purpose uh number 10 uh this is a  women's point of view here a movie called duma it's not duma d-u-m-a  what is duma duma hawk he's having a tough mind it's d-u-m-a maybe it's about voss it's called  dumba oh my god d-u-m-a an orphaned cheetah becomes the best friend and pet of a young boy 
[02:30:00]  living in south africa oh that sounds good and then the boy and the cheetah are killed when their  cars and fucking carjacked that awful savage town why would she like this movie we got to get her  on my phone she did in a car i don't know why do i call south africa a town because i'm a dope 
[02:30:30]  that's what the name of that movie should have been the boy finds the cheetah  see this is where we need someone to think outside the box like we're doing this list from this woman  and it's a very strange list yes so we should have her on the phone or at least try to get her on  the phone ah there you go that would that's actually thinking of calling the box i think  that would uh make some interesting radio trying to think like the box all right uh she also liked  a movie called 2046 all right is it numbers and hawk you can like wait is it just number oh it's like a 
[02:31:00]  year and this movie no give me this he was a writer yeah he thought he wrote about the future but it  really was the past in his novel a mysterious train left for 2046 every once in a while  everyone who went there had the same intention to recapture their lost memories it was said that in 
[02:31:30]  2046 nothing ever changed nobody knew for sure if it was true because nobody who went there had ever  come back except one he was there he chose to leave he wanted to change  um could i get a yes yeah wow what like and i i'm a i'm just a sucker for any time kind of travel  movie time different movie people think it's a different time movie thing like that that's kind 
[02:32:00]  of why i like the village which people thought you know the time that they were i like that back to  the future movie it was terrific wanna go back in time the power of love the power of love oh is that  an atrocious fucking song how do you not huey lewis was in the studio i know he let me drop a name  huey lewis my friend don't drop his cock on your foot because i heard it's massive he's that  fucking power of love is atrocious power of love is a curious thing make one man weep make another 
[02:32:30]  man sing yeah exactly heart to a little white dove it's more than a feeling it's the power of love my  friend and now this year you'll say the same thing cut the music for a second why it's beautiful how  do you know that exactly um because i've seen uh back to the future movies probably all of them  800 times i've seen them too what are you doing flying for elton's wedding next week i love the  back to the future movies i mean you know the lyrics to that song i got the box set i i watched them 
[02:33:00]  with the the director's cut the actual lyrics he gets choked up to that song don't need money  well i know that fame don't need no cut cut i just know it to ride the train yeah i don't even think uh  i ever did that even karaoke or anything it just got stuck in my head hey you want to go in the  bathroom and finger each other's asses and sing jack and diane you know something it sold a lot  of records my friend i don't know more than black sabbath more than any one black sabbath song it's 
[02:33:30]  because they don't have fucking that awful opening what yeah well it's for a movie so it's got to have  that back to the future sound that's right like uh back to the don't need money take a rip off a hole  in the sky anyway it's fucking dumb you ass all right here we go she also liked uh mr and mrs smith  that red pit oh of course because there's like you don't really see if that isn't abroad trying  to review a fucking movie i heard that stunk didn't see it but uh it's going to make the broad list

[02:38:00]  family shot secretly from the street and alarming drawings whose meaning is obscure he has no idea  who may be sending them gradually the footage on the tape becomes more personal suggesting that the  sender has known george's or jorge for some time jorge feels a sense of menace hanging over him and his  family but as no direct threat but that doesn't make sense but as no direct threat has been made 
[02:38:30]  the police refuse to help that sounds like a ripoff of fucking mohawk of no wait what was the one with  robert blake when he took video in the david lynch movie yeah robin william highway the high lost  highway oh i'm thinking about the robin williams uh one hour photo is one hour photo no this is videos  of pictures this is videos of uh in in the lost highway when bill paulman gets the videos and it's  him and his wife sleeping love that scene where he's taking a and the uh he's fantasizes that he's in 
[02:39:00]  the house uh one hour photo i don't remember he's taking a and the family's toilet one hour photo was  such a great idea and they just missed the mark serious robin and it still was a pretty good movie  but they should have waited and and then you know we just i don't know whatever i don't think it got  um did get frightening enough like he was scary and all i understand the idea was great but they 
[02:39:30]  just didn't pull it off he wasn't a big enough creep like i didn't like what he did it was like  there was nothing really bad about it should have been something no it should have been really creepy  what did he make her do just lay on the bed and do some weird shit made them have sex or something  yeah but he never took pictures of them actually having sex and they had had sex it wasn't like he was  making them do something they never did right and then he just took pictures of things around  the room well yeah all right um let's get through this awful list sticking them out by this lady jamie  from the daily news her top movies of the year number three the squid and the whale oh if i gotta look

[02:47:00]  Getting your ticket.  We have Isaac Hayes entering the studio as we speak.  Best known as the voice of Chef on South Park.  Is that his best known?  Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  In 2004, Hayes appeared in a recurring minor role as the Jaffa Tulloch on the television series Stargate SG-1.  The following year, he appeared in the critically acclaimed independent film Hustle and Flow.  Hayes is also an outspoken Scientologist. 
[02:47:30]  The top-selling Hot Butter Soul 1969 was a breakthrough album.  Hi, Isaac.  How are you?  Damn right.  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  All right.  He has the greatest voice of all time.  That's it, man.  We're just reading your bio as you were settling in, and it goes on and on and on and on.  You can sing with it and talk with it, that voice.  It's amazing.  Nice, deep, yeah.  Must have gotten the ladies back in the day, right?  Still does, obviously. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, back.  I'm married to my fourth wife now.  Six months married.  Fourth wife?  All right.  We're going to start there.  And a child is on the way.  A child on the way.  I can talk about back in the day, but that's back in the day.  It's not now.  Right.  That's another unit of time.  Isaac, we understand this, and you prefaced it very nicely.  I was mad.  As to keep yourself safe.  But it must have just been as easy as, hey, baby, you won't go back in my place.  And it's over, Johnny, right?  My crib with yours, baby.  Like the Pied Piper, the chicks are just following him home. 
[02:48:30]  You can just tell with that voice.  That's gold, that voice.  But what are you doing with four wives?  Well, you know, like you said, keep trying and trying until you get it right.  No, no.  Getting it right is not doing it again.  After the show, all right, let's say the first one.  Now, I'll give everyone one, because I even have one.  Look, man, I was green as, can I say this?  You can say anything.  I was green as goose shit.  That's, and goose shit is quite green.  How old were you when you got married the first time?  I was 19.  I was green, man. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, no.  I was a country boy.  That's just dumb.  Had been anywhere.  That's just dumb.  You know.  What did you get?  Well, where were you?  I was in Memphis, Tennessee.  So you're in Memphis.  You meet a nice young lady.  Yeah.  You decide that's the whole world.  You don't know what the hell's going on out there.  Right.  You get married, and then all of a sudden, oh, man.  Oh.  An awakening.  When I start working at Stacks, me and David Porter start writing his songs.  Chicks, chicks everywhere.  And you're like, what did I do?  We're the smallest boy.  So now, I can understand that happening. 
[02:49:30]  You're like Superman, growing up in Smallville, and all of a sudden, you find out what Metropolis  is like.  I'm a Metropolis.  That's right.  So I'll give you that.  Why, then?  You get divorced, obviously.  What makes you do it, number two?  Another one came along.  Well, they'll always come along.  They just keep on coming, Isaac.  It took me a long time to ripen.  I was green as good shit.  I told you.  Yeah, but you know, a first wife won't only ripen you.  She'll put a few bruises on the skin.  That's right. 
[02:50:00]  And make you taste a little mealy.  This girl has some nice ointment.  Oh, is that it?  Soothe my bruises.  You know what I'm saying?  So you marry her.  Yeah.  And kids with the first wife?  Yeah, I got two.  Two with the first wife.  But I had one before the first wife.  Oh, okay.  So before you got married, you had one.  How old were you for the first one?  Well.  First kid now.  They were very close.  I mean, I was 19 and my kids were months apart.  Wow. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  So now you got some kids, then you get the first wife, you have a couple more kids, and  then the second wife.  Hold on, I'm keeping track.  Three kids with the second wife.  All right, hold on.  Give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  My goodness.  Hold on.  I got it.  You are working.  One kid out of wedlock.  This guy's from, Jimmy just got pregnant.  Just from sitting next to Isaac.  One kid out of wedlock.  Two kids with the first marriage.  Yeah.  Now you got three with the second.  With the first. 
[02:51:00]  Three more kids with the second.  Now, what happened with the second marriage?  And what year was this about?  How were you?  That was around 60.  The second was around 65.  65?  Yeah.  And what are you doing for a living back in 65?  I was writing songs.  Writing songs.  Working at Stacks.  Yeah.  Side musician.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So what happened now with the second one?  Where'd that go wrong?  Well.  We're educating our listeners.  Well, it went on the rocks.  I don't want to go into detail. 
[02:51:30]  I don't need detail.  But, you know, she, I mean, this one really took my heart and ripped it out and jumped up  and down.  Oh, stamped on it.  Stomped on it.  Oh, man.  All right.  In other words, maybe a little karma came around and, like, because of what happened  with the first marriage, the second one kind of made you feel a little, you know.  No, but, look, I was good.  I was definitely, I was green, let me tell you.  Yeah.  And, like I said in Phoenix, you know, hey, I did the right thing. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  But it just didn't happen right for me.  And, and then the second one, I was, I was crazy mad in love with that man.  And I felt like committing suicide.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  When it went bad.  And, uh, but they, my, my, my band members talked to me and everything and saved me from,  you know, driving into a tree.  They said there's a lot of pussy on that road.  No, you hang in there, Isaac.  They got together and went, if Isaac kills himself, we're fucked.  You know, we're going to pay the electric bill. 
[02:52:30]  I'm talking meal ticket here, my friend.  You're getting this guy alive.  I had it so bad.  Every woman that looked like her, I went for her.  Really?  I had it so bad.  How long were you with her?  What did she look like?  Oh, she was awesome.  What did she look like?  You got, like, an actress maybe or something?  She was, she was, she was high yellow.  Yeah?  You know.  High yellow?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And she had legs and she had legs.  From there to there, right?  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Nice ass, bam. 
[02:53:00]  All of that.  Yeah.  And when I finally recovered from that, then I, David Porter introduced me, my co-writing  buddy, introduced me to my third wife.  All right.  Here we go.  The third wife.  Now, how long after the second was the third?  Like, did you meet her?  Enough time went by where you were able to get over the second wife.  Well, I met a, when the other one, when the second went bad. 
[02:53:30]  See, the brother needed something.  So you, the brother needed a life boy.  You were so in love with this girl.  No, no, no.  But the morning, the morning took about a week.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That was a long time.  All right.  And then, when I met my third wife, I was straight.  I went, David's, come on, let's go, let's go, we're writing in D.C.  Mm-hmm.  Went and wrote, that's when we wrote a lot of his songs for Sam and Dave.  And I met him, David had a girlfriend already. 
[02:54:00]  She was a friend of David.  Oops.  No, he's a divorced man now.  Okay.  It's all safe.  So, so.  Isaac Hayes blowing up everyone's phone.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They divorced twice now, anyway.  All right.  So, so, David said, come on, man.  I went to D.C. with David.  And he said, so-and-so is coming over to meet you, man.  I said, okay.  So, my door, in the hotel, nobody locked on my door. 
[02:54:30]  I opened the door.  She said, I said, hey.  I said, yeah.  She reached her hand out.  I shook her hand.  I said, come on in.  She had a big, long coat on.  Mm-hmm.  And she turned around to me to take her coat off.  I took her coat off.  Bam!  I said, oh, God.  Naked, right?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I'm in trouble.  With that ass up high, right?  Oh.  Right, Isaac?  Come on.  That's when those first minutes came out.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, God.  Isaac instantly, out of instinct, dropped to one knee and gave her a ring.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:55:00]  No?  No, I was strong.  I was strong.  No, no.  We talked that night and blah, blah, blah, blah.  All that.  And then, she was ready to go.  And David heard the door slamming.  We had a door in the room.  Hey, man.  How'd you do?  I said, man, I ain't playing.  I'm not playing, man.  I said, I'm straight.  She was nice.  She looked good and everything.  So, anyway, they're supposed to come the next night.  We're supposed to start writing at a restaurant in D.C. upstairs.  And she didn't show up.  And I got pissed. 
[02:55:30]  Not that I was going to do anything, but it's like a disrespect thing.  And so, I said, man, I'm going home.  No, I can't.  You can't leave, man.  If you go, I have to go.  I said, I'm going home, sucker.  So, I went on home.  Went back home.  And a couple of days later, she called me.  Hey, he's...  What?  He's, uh...  Uh...  I got a cold.  They said, she got a cold, man.  You know, she needed some medicine and stuff.  I said, okay, I'm sorry.  You got a cold and everything.  So, then... 
[02:56:00]  And that's why she didn't show up.  Nah.  Nah.  She tried to give me that excuse.  Yeah.  Now she's going for the excuse.  Wait, were you famous yet?  Oh, famous songwriter.  Yeah.  So, then, um...  She said, she called one night.  She said, I'm at a party.  I'm going to go home.  Will you call when I get home?  I called her.  She went home.  Hey, I need a...  Uh...  I need...  It's a coat I saw in some department store.  Will you buy that for me?  Jesus.  I said, who in the hell are you saying I am? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Who in the...  You know, so...  Man, she said, hey, nobody ever talked to me like that.  I want to see you.  Oh, she was digging it.  Yeah.  I want to see you.  So, now, my other man was just kicking me in the butt.  So, I was so beat up.  You know, so I said, well, I took a plane and flew back up there and saw her.  And that's when I got locked.  So, things happened, let's just say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you hooked up with her. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  And now, that's the third wife.  Yeah.  We've been together for nine years.  Nine years.  Nine years.  So, you got to have, what, nine, ten kids?  We got three kids.  Three kids.  All right.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  We got two kids out of that one.  All right.  Two kids.  Yeah.  Out of that.  Okay.  Two kids out of that.  All right.  And then, in the meantime...  He's up to eight kids.  In the meantime...  Eight kids, four different women.  Wow.  In the meantime...  God bless you.  I sired...  One, two... 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, I think...  Let me count now.  Three.  Yeah, two kids.  Two kids.  Two more outside of...  Exactly.  ...any of the wives.  One's we haven't counted yet?  Yeah.  All right.  So, two more.  Add two.  Two more.  Two more out of wedlock.  And was that between marriages or kind of during marriages a couple of times?  When the marriages started going on the rise.  Right.  It started going on the rise.  It's a gray area.  Right.  It's a gray area.  It's called On the Rock.  That Isaac's a bad mother.  What's your count?  What's your count now?  I'm up to ten, I believe. 
[02:58:00]  And one on the way now with the fourth wife.  No, ten on the way.  Ten, okay.  You don't even know how many kids you have?  No, no, no.  I mean, I'm just keeping up with the times.  Is it about right?  Yeah, that's right.  Okay.  And then that was after...  The third one started going bad.  Right.  And then that was another one.  My youngest.  Another wedlock?  No, another child.  That's 11, isn't it? 
[02:58:30]  That's 11.  Wait, so now we got three out of wedlock?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's 11.  All right, we got 11 kids.  And I stayed single for a long time.  Yeah.  About 20 years.  I said, I ain't never this anymore.  Never.  But then I went to Ghana, West Africa.  And I met this...  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  An African woman?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're in trouble.  See?  I hear about you guys.  You go there, you get all spiritual and shit.  You go to the motherland.  And then all of a sudden, you're like... 
[02:59:00]  Trust me.  Oh, I'm not gone, boy, Isaac.  These chicks start clicking at you.  No, that's Klauser.  I'm talking Ghana is Western Africa.  Yeah?  Klauser is South Africa.  Ah, you were in West Africa.  West Africa.  What, like north?  No, no, no.  Just West Africa.  Just West, you know, Ghana is on that cape.  Uh-huh.  You know...  The little bulge that comes out of there?  Yeah, it comes out on the underside.  Underside of that one.  It's bordered on the south by the Atlantic Ocean. 
[02:59:30]  Uh-huh.  And it's bordered on the west, on the east by the Volta River.  And they made me...  I became a king over there.  A king?  King Isaac Hayes.  My name is Ninde Cartel-Conser I.  That was in 92.  No shit.  When I saw this girl, man, I thought she was Indian because she had that look, man.  And she was starting to become an aerobics instructor.  She had another girl, and she was just dying.  Isn't aerobics just natural over there?  You got to run away from fucking lions and shit? 
[03:00:00]  It's like aerobics.  It's called living.  But trust me, it's not like a Tarzan story or none of that kind of shit.  No?  Those people are wonderful.  And she took down her hair and shook her head, and I said, oh, shit.  I fell down past her shoulders.  I said, oh, God.  I was instantly smitten again.  Again.  Again.  20 years, you're single, and now you go to Africa, and now you're getting all tied up  again.  But this girl, I mean, this girl, she was tough. 
[03:00:30]  This is the one, right, Isaac?  Yeah.  She made me wait.  I mean, she put my ethics in.  I mean, that was back in 92.  We just got married.  Did she know who you were?  No.  She didn't care.  I don't care who you are.  No.  Yeah.  No.  She had a head on straight.  Mm-hmm.  And you got one on the way with her, so that'll make 12 kids.  12 kids.  Wow.  And guess what?  12 kids with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight different women.  I got 16 grandkids. 
[03:01:00]  16 grandkids.  16 grandkids.  And three great-grands.  Call me John Appleseed.  Yeah, kid.  No.  Isaac, how old are you?  I'm 63.  Wow.  Holy.  You don't look 16.  Doesn't he look great?  You don't look.  I'm a health fanatic, man.  Yeah, what do you do?  He fucks all day.  No.  No, I'm telling you.  No, I pull my ethics in, and I feel good about it.  I'm straight now. 
[03:01:30]  And it took me a long time to find myself.  Were you ever doing a lot of drugs or anything?  No, never did that.  You never did.  Thank God, I never did.  You didn't have time to do drugs.  Yeah, right?  You want to do some drugs?  Fuck that.  Hang on.  Got to have sex over here.  Got to make another kid.  Never got to fell into the drugs, though.  No, never did.  See, because working backstage behind the scenes, David Porter, we saw various artists and saw  how artists did and saw how they destroyed their lives.  I said, no, I'm never going down that road.  Never did.  What are the rumors now about them doing more work with you and Donald Pleasance? 
[03:02:00]  Any?  Donald Pleasance?  Escape from New York now?  Yeah.  No, Donald, you know, Donald dropped his body a few years ago.  Oh, he died?  I didn't know that.  Pleasance has died a couple of years ago.  He died, Jimmy.  I didn't know that.  Jesus.  I didn't know that.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I didn't know.  I'm sorry, Isaac.  Jimmy knows nothing.  Jimmy's been to Mars or something.  He took a vacation.  No, because he is so self-centered that unless it's been involving him directly, he has no 
[03:02:30]  clue.  That's a piece of work that I love very much, and that dummy right there was telling me  that they were actually thinking of doing a sequel, and I'm like, really?  Like they couldn't do it without Donald Pleasance.  Wait, now you took what E-Rock told you, you were trying to make it your own, and now  you can blame E-Rock.  Oh, but that was what you said.  No, they did the second escape from New York, you know, escape from L.A.  Yeah.  And I tried to get into that one, but I'm glad I didn't.  Yeah, that wasn't as good as the first one.  You were very good.  Let's go to Darren.  First film.  Darren, what's up?  What's up, Owen?  Hey, Darren.  Come on, Jimmy.  Welcome back, bro. 
[03:03:00]  Thank you.  Listen, my question is for Isaac Hayes.  Yo.  What are your child support payments like?  Do you pay child support?  Oh, man.  I'm going through that.  Oh, man.  I got three, huh?  I'm like, I'm doing math over here.  Now, it's a good thing that some of them kind of aged out, but then you go and get back  into the fine past.  Yeah, but, you know, I never was a deadbeat dad.  I took care of all my kids.  I know where they are.  That's beautiful.  That's beautiful.  I stay in touch with them, and I even give my grandkids gifts for Christmas. 
[03:03:30]  You know, in fact, the kids are grown now, so I give my grandkids gifts.  I mean, I'm into literacy and education, so I buy them gifts from Toys R Us and little  ones, and the older ones, I give them gifts from department stores, and I give them all  gifts to bookstores, because I want them to read.  Mm-hmm.  And I just make sure they're illiterate.  All right.  Thanks, Darren.  All right.  Let's go to Tony in Wisconsin.  Tony.  Hey, my question is for Isaac Hayes.  Yo.  Hey.  What did you think? 
[03:04:00]  You're Scientologists, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  What did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on South Park about Scientology?  Well, what?  With Cruz in the closet.  Well.  Yeah, that was a great episode.  One thing about.  They remaned, I think, last week, too.  Yeah, one thing about Matt and Trey, they lampooned everybody.  Mm-hmm.  And if you take that shit serious, then I'll sell you to Brooklyn Bridge for $2.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to realize what they're doing.  Yeah, that's what they do.  And take it.  That's what they do.  What is Scientology all about? 
[03:04:30]  I still don't understand it.  You still don't understand?  It's UFOs and stuff.  No.  It's cleansing the body.  I really don't, I'm not, I don't understand it, though, that's all.  But I don't understand the Catholic faith either, so.  There's bad things that are in there for years and years and years.  No, Scientology is an applied religious philosophy.  See, people get it all mixed up.  And all I say is, you know, read a book.  Read about it.  We've got books that explain all about it.  And when I got into Scientology, I was just like everybody else. 
[03:05:00]  I heard, I heard you guys, I was going on hearsay.  And the lady told me, she said, look, why don't you take a course and see for yourself?  When I took a course, the first course called Overcoming Ups and Downs in Life, and I took  that course, halfway through the course, I said, damn, I'm learning something.  Shit.  I was finding answers about me, about life that I had never known.  And then I took another course.  I wanted to take another course so bad, but I wouldn't give it a satisfaction. 
[03:05:30]  I was blown away.  I said, well, I'm going to take another course to see what, you know.  So I took another course called Personal Values and Integrity.  And when I did that, that's when I decided to become a Scientologist.  See, that seems all well and fine, you know, because that sounds like things that a lot of  people can use and utilize in their daily life.  Yeah.  When does it start getting controversial?  When, when, how many, like, courses in, do they start telling you about the Thetans and 
[03:06:00]  things that are like, that's, because that's when they lose people.  The proper word is Thetan.  Thetan.  In Greek terminology, that means spirit.  Right.  We're all spiritual beings.  The bodies are just mess, matter in the space and time, the physical universe.  But we're all spiritual beings, which, which, the spirit never dies.  Messed is just like this paper here, like the desk was sitting there.  That's all messed.  But the spirit stays.  And where does it go when we die? 
[03:06:30]  The spirit just doesn't go anywhere.  It doesn't go anywhere.  We just pick up other bodies.  I ain't going to get into all that, but that's what happens.  Man, I want to get into your body with all the, uh, the women you're back in.  Yeah, I believe in reincarnation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that part of the, uh, Scientology philosophy of reincarnation?  Reincarnation?  Yeah.  It is?  Yeah, but I, you know, but it, it, uh, it validated my, my theory.  Because I believe in reincarnation before I heard about Scientology.  And that just fortified my belief in reincarnation. 
[03:07:00]  See, it's totally cool if, I don't care, you know, whatever gets everybody through their  day, you know.  If they want to sit there and, uh, uh, uh, pray to a, a stick or, you know, any, any type  of religion you want to.  No, but see, somebody talking about a stick.  As long as it makes you happy.  Yeah, but that's bullshit.  To my, to a stick.  No, see, people, people come with all kinds.  You know, when, when, when, uh, a new religion comes into being, you get all kinds of rumors  about what, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But the thing about it is, it's very, very ethical. 
[03:07:30]  And those that don't have ethics, they get pissed and go out and make all kinds of lies  and do all kinds of stuff like that.  And, and people that don't know, they believe it.  That's why I say, read it.  Check it out for yourself.  Don't listen to what Joe says.  Check it out for yourself.  Do they request a certain percentage of income?  That, that's a rumor that goes around about Scientology, too.  No.  Okay, so it's a rumor.  No, no, no, that's bullshit, too.  And when I went there, I said, I hear y'all take folks money. 
[03:08:00]  I remember, I was talking shit like everybody else did.  Then I, I felt like an idiot when I, I wasn't like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were you guys all freaking, though, about Tom Cruise?  I mean, he, he kind of blew his mouth off.  No, no, Tom is cool.  Tom is cool.  Yeah.  Because he, he was, ooh, he was making things look a little bad for a long time.  Well, no, but see, what Tom did, Tom attacked the, the world of psychology.  Uh-huh.  He saved, just by getting on Oprah talking, he saved the lives of maybe,  400,000 kids. 
[03:08:30]  How's that?  That was, that was taking those psych drugs.  You know?  Yeah, but.  Did they force it on them?  Some people think that might work, and others say it doesn't, but.  No, no, no.  And I think that's where Scientology, where people start going like, oh, brother.  You know, people like Tom Cruise get out there, and they bash psychology, and, and certain  psychotropic drugs that work for people.  Well, if you think about that, they, every kid, I would say 99% of the kids that go off  and shoot their classes up and all this kind of shit, like Columbine, they have had some 
[03:09:00]  kind of psychiatric influence.  Mm-hmm.  They have.  And, uh, I could, I could give you the, give you the history of psychology, I mean psychiatry,  but, all you gotta do is visit our headquarters of CCHR, Citizens Commission on Human Rights.  Visit them, and they'll, they'll give you a whole tour, and give you the history of psychiatry.  You know what, uh, history of psychiatry I had that kept me from, uh, shooting up a school,  or cursing out a teacher, or something like that? 
[03:09:30]  It was called the back of my father's hand.  That, that drug worked great.  It was a smack, and I didn't do it anymore.  Well, see, I, I, I went through that too, but, think of those who did not, that the  sites got to them and give them Riddling and Prozac and all this kind of shit.  That's what, that's what messed them up.  And, remember the days of the hippies and stuff?  Um, LSD and all this kind of shit?  Yeah.  That was psychic influence.  They were experimenting on us.  We-  You think that was like government, uh, experiments?  Well, I don't know about government, but it was psychic, wherever they had influence, 
[03:10:00]  and they probably had influence in our government.  But, the stuff came out of, uh,  Like drug companies and-  Yeah, those, those guys.  They're getting all the money.  Yeah.  That's where the money's going.  Well, I gotta give them that.  The drug companies do really seem to be pushing a lot of that stuff out there these days.  Yeah.  All the commercials on TV, anything you watch.  Are you saying the drug companies don't have integrity?  I don't buy it.  You never-  He's been on Mars again.  He's been on Mars again. 
[03:10:30]  What do you do?  You got a headache?  You take an aspirin or something like that?  No, I don't.  You don't?  No, no.  You take nothing.  No, no, no.  You see what I do?  You shit.  That's what you do.  Get all that junk out of me.  You take a dump.  Clean yourself.  That's what Opie said.  That's it.  Isaac.  Clean yourself.  Yep.  You ever take a Vicodin?  That shit is so good.  What's that?  A Vicodin?  You take it, and you just go like-  Is it laxative?  No, no, no.  It's like a muscle relaxer. 
[03:11:00]  It's one of those pills like OxyContin and all those drugs that all the actors get addicted to.  I don't mess with those drugs.  I stay with them.  No, no.  I don't mess with them.  I know, but-  But occasionally, you like popping one.  You take pain medicine, though, right?  What if you had a toothache and it was pounded?  No, if it's so bad.  Because that's what they gave me.  If it's so bad.  I've had toothache, I'd take the drugs in if it's so bad.  Yeah.  But, you know, I didn't get that out of me.  We got a thing in Scientology called, you can get all that stuff out of you. 
[03:11:30]  Get out of here.  Oh, yes, you do.  We cleanse and get the prescription drugs.  You get the street drugs.  You get an insecticide, pesticides, a radiation poison.  You get all that out of you.  That's right.  Let me ask you a question.  This is something, like you say, when it gets so bad, you've got to take something from pain.  So what's the difference between that and, say, something psychological, 
[03:12:00]  where for someone who can't do it any other way, like legitimately can't,  for them it's so bad they have to take something.  So I'm saying, like, what's the difference between one or the other?  Good point, Jimmy.  Good point.  Wait, now, you mean when people have, if the pain is so bad?  With a threshold for whatever it is, like for me it would be like an abscessed tooth or whatever.  You've got to take some kind of a pain medication.  So with psychology, like, you know, there are some cases where I'm sure it's prescribed wrong,  but what if it's legitimate and for them the pain is so bad? 
[03:12:30]  A mental pain that is so bad.  Or a mental dysfunction, whatever it is.  Well, we call it, we call it in psychology, we call it, I mean, in Scientology, we call it treating an engram.  Engram is pictures of pain, physical or mental.  And we can erase the engram, get all that stuff out of you.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And how is that done, like, without giving away any trade secrets or anything?  Well, it's a process called auditing. 
[03:13:00]  And an auditor is one who listens.  Like auditorium, auditory nerds and stuff, that's about hearing.  Not auditors like a guy that cooked the books.  Yeah, that's the only auditor I know.  The one that's poking out with 20 grand on my taxes.  Look, I had that experience, too.  But anyway, what you do, you listen to these guys and they will find the areas where you had those engrams created.  And they erase the engrams, get rid of them. 
[03:13:30]  And then some people are paralyzed, but they get up and walk.  Get out of here.  I'm just telling you, there's some wonderful things about that, man.  And it doesn't hurt you.  And we have things called giving people assists.  Assist is when you experience some pain or injury and stuff, get them an assist, a nerve assist.  They handle all that.  It handles all of that.  And I'm going to tell you what.  Remember when 9-11 happened and all those rescue workers were down there at Ground Zero, you know, firing all the people. 
[03:14:00]  They were inhaling all that dust and all that junk.  Yeah.  Those firemen were disabled.  And we have a process.  Tom Cruise set up a lot of those things that you can have, getting there to have sweat outs.  And you get in the sauna and sweat all that junk out of you.  And those guys were sweating in their towels.  They were sweating.  Those towels were purple.  They were getting all them pews out of those guys. 
[03:14:30]  And those guys went back to work.  Had Tom not done that, they would have been disabled on disability right now.  And those firemen sing praises to what happened for them.  So why isn't this more, like, why can't people say, look at what we've done.  Here's proof that it's been done.  Because it seems like this should be all over the world.  Well, we do.  Helping.  We do, but people choose to follow that bullshit.  And it's been there.  We're doing it now. 
[03:15:00]  But people choose to look for the bad shit, those disgruntled folks that didn't have their ethics in.  And they turn sour.  And they start spreading all kind of bullshit about that.  And that's the bad thing.  Maybe other religions, I'm just playing devil's advocate, maybe other religions that don't like the fact that it's picking up a lot of members and press.  And it's impractical to their beliefs.  Maybe they're throwing out some bad press about it.  Well, maybe they are.  I'm not just saying that because I'm in L.A.  Maybe they're sour.  Maybe they are.  But we don't discriminate against any religion. 
[03:15:30]  Because everybody wants to better themselves and cleanse themselves and have a better life.  And everybody wants to survive.  So you can be whatever you want to be, but just use the technology of Scientology.  You can be a Christian, a Baptist.  You can be a Buddhist.  You can be a Muslim.  Whatever.  You know, we do not discriminate.  But what it does, it makes you a better whatever you are.  If you're a Muslim, it makes you a better Muslim. 
[03:16:00]  What's the one religion you think is crazy?  I don't know.  Because a lot of people would say Scientology.  So I'm wondering what a Scientologist would say for that.  We don't, we don't, we never, we don't.  There's got to be one where you go, oh, man.  No.  Come on.  We don't do that.  The Nike guys.  The Nike guys.  The Nike guys.  We can all agree.  The Nike guys.  That thought the spaceship was behind the comet.  Yeah, yeah.  But they had to cut their genitals off.  Cut their genitals off and killed themselves.  Right.  On the bed.  Marshall White Apple, right?  Yeah, the Reverend Jim Jones.  There you go.  He had a cult down there with the Kool-Aid. 
[03:16:30]  That's kind of kooky.  Well.  That's cult, that's the whole cult thing.  Well.  You'll watch him.  I say that's unfortunate.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  See?  It's very diplomatic.  No, no, no.  I'm just telling the truth about it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan in New York.  Dan, what's up?  Nothing.  Sorry to regret on the topic, but is Isaac, when he like sleeps with these women, do they  all get pregnant?  Or, I mean, is it just eight women?  Oh, y'all worry about my, my, my, my, what's it, what's it? 
[03:17:00]  I was wondering if every girl you've slept with has had a kid.  No, no, no, no.  There have been a couple where you went, do you believe in the birth control?  Because I was going to say, yeah, I believe it doesn't fit.  Birth control is, is, is, is.  It's for pussies, right?  Put it out.  Put it out.  Would you, would you eat a steak wrapped in plastic?  Of course not.  We wouldn't taste it.  Doesn't taste good.  I might if it fucking, 40 other steaks would show up if I didn't. 
[03:17:30]  But look, but when I, when I, when I was doing all of that, you know, um, I, I didn't,  I didn't know any better.  And I was living that, living that kind of life.  Sure.  And, um.  You're 63.  How old is your fourth wife?  She's 35.  There you go.  Brother kind of riding the cradle in the middle.  No, but, okay, but, you see, it's cool.  Now, you, you live, uh, here in the States?  Yeah, I live in.  You brought her over from Africa?  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  And how did she, uh, did she have to adjust?  What did she think about America?  Yeah, I brought, I brought New York first.  Wow.  And, I mean, she was living in the skyscrapers and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  But, I mean, she adjusted very well.  Yeah.  She did.  And she's cool.  She found your credit card.  She's doing well, right?  No.  Let me tell you about that.  Probably just the opposite.  That's what I found great about her, because she didn't get hung up in that material stuff.  Right.  And instead, the whole thing, when her brother found out I was in Ghana, he said, you out 
[03:18:30]  of here?  Do you know who that is?  She said, I don't know.  I don't care.  Uh, we ran in the house and got an, got an, got an, got an LP.  Is this the guy you, she said, yeah.  That's how, so?  But it, all that stuff did not, did not faze her.  No.  And that's what, that's what got me.  Because I remember when Eddie Murphy, on one of his, one of his, uh, albums, she said,  Oh, the Goonie Goo Goo.  I'm going to find me somebody who don't know how to spell alimony.  Go to Africa and find me.  Some zebra bitch.  Zebra riding Goonie Goo Goo bitch. 
[03:19:00]  But, but, you know, he said in, in, in joke, in jest, but the thing is that, uh, my wife  is, she's not caught up in material stuff.  That's cool.  And, you know, she was, she was studying two years before I met her.  She was studying to become a nun.  Really?  That was clean.  Wow.  You cleaned her off.  That must be some junk you're sporting there to get a girl out of the nunnery.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, she left before she met me.  Oh, yeah?  I wouldn't do that. 
[03:19:30]  I wasn't like, oh, I found a new god.  You know, what's this?  Isaac Hayes is sporting.  That's quite a cock that makes you walk away from eternity.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  Hey, Jimmy.  What do you got here now?  Ultimate Isaac Hayes.  Can you dig it?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Look at this.  Wow.  Well, what happened?  Is this a recent picture, you?  No, I did that in 76.  Yeah, you did. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, look.  I can take my shirt off now.  Well, you don't.  I'm not too bad.  But you look like I can't tell.  Yeah, I know you can't.  That's why I have to ask.  Uh-huh.  You look exactly the same.  You're not aged.  That shot was done in 76 after Deion Walk, and I did a close-out concert up in, what was  that, up in, outside of San Francisco.  Damn.  Deion and around.  And we went, we had to go in San Francisco for this photo shoot.  We were tired, man.  And that was done at about 4 o'clock in the morning by Norman Seath, the great photographer. 
[03:20:30]  He did those shots.  And, uh, it's still, I'm still holding up.  Damn, hell yeah, man.  And look at those glasses with those monograms on the go.  You can tell it's dated.  And look at the watch that I had on.  Oh, wow.  Look at that watch.  Damn.  I was afraid.  One of the earlier digital watches.  Wow.  First digital watch.  Yeah.  Like a calculator watch.  Like a Pulsar, whatever.  You remember those Pulsars with the red digits? 
[03:21:00]  Well, they really thought those digital watches were going to take over.  Right, right, right.  Like any future movie you watch from the past, they all got the digital watches.  It lasted for a while, and then everyone went, you know, something, ah, they died.  Going back to the classic style.  That's it.  And I have a photo with you.  I don't think you, at the Trump roast, as you were walking up the stage, I kind of just  stopped you.  Oh, that was you?  Yes.  I've been looking for you, man.  Because I signed it.  It's at home.  But I didn't know where to get it to you.  Oh, wow.  Wait, what's the familiar of that? 
[03:21:30]  What's funny?  Okay.  You were the one.  Yeah.  I did it right before I left home the other day.  I said, I've got to find this guy.  Oh, it's hilarious.  I was on the set.  I'm taping a show on the set where Isaac was doing a Super Bowl commercial next door.  And so, of course, I wanted to get my photo with him signed, so I ran out and blew it up.  And they put it on the bus, and I never heard back.  So they're like, ah, the bus driver must have made a mistake or whatever.  It's an envelope, man.  Okay.  I signed it.  I signed it in that silver ink on the shopping. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  I signed it.  Okay.  Give me your address before I leave this.  I'll just have you sign this one.  Okay.  I had to do it today.  Well, I'll send it to you.  You have two signs.  I'd like that.  Give me that address.  Send it back to you.  He doesn't want to keep looking at your picture.  No, no.  You just sign this one.  No, I'll give you.  I have an idea.  I'll sign this one, and you can hang this one up in your place.  And I'll hang yours up in my place.  Got to keep the burglars out, Warren.  That's what Isaac wants to do, man.  Dave. 
[03:22:30]  Let's go to a guy just called Trucker.  Trucker.  Hello?  That's you.  What's up, man?  Seth, you are like my favorite character on South Park.  One of the best cartoon characters ever, I think.  Well, thank you, Trucker.  Yeah, how'd that fall into your lap, man?  Because that was a...  What happened?  Well, I kept ragging my agent about, give me some voiceovers.  Give me some voiceovers, man.  So one day, he's a British guy.  Mr. Hayes, I think I have a voiceover for you. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, Disney.  That is a perfect English accent, by the way.  I lived in London for a year.  I said, yeah, Disney.  He said, no, not quite.  What do you mean?  Well, this is a bit different.  Well, different what?  I was already turned off.  He said, well, it's different.  It's called something about, called like South Park.  What is South Park?  He said, look.  The guys are coming in.  I was here in New York.  The guys are coming in town tomorrow.  And they want to meet you. 
[03:23:30]  Over at the Sony studio over there.  You know.  Anyway.  I said, I ain't going to see you.  No.  Go.  She talked me to go and see him.  So, I showed up.  I had an attitude.  Madden Trey.  Yeah, man.  What's up?  I said, Mr. Hayes, man.  You're a perfect good pod, man.  It's good to meet you, man.  You're perfect for this pod.  What pod, man?  Well, you're the voice of a chef in a town called South Park, Colorado.  And you're an elementary cook at this school. 
[03:24:00]  And you're going to cook for the kids.  You're going to mentor these little foul-mouthed kids.  I said, man, I'm out of here.  No, no, no, no.  Read this.  Read this.  He gave me a piece of the script.  And I started cracking up.  I said, who put you guys up here?  Is somebody playing a joke on me?  It can possibly be a real show, right?  Yeah.  I said, no, no.  He said, no, no.  Everything's fine.  You guys are serious about this?  Well, yes, yes.  Well, one thing.  You guys got insurance because y'all get sued like hell.  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, no, no.  Everything's covered.  Everything is fine.  I said, damn.  You guys are serious about this.  Y'all are some crazy white boys there.  Yeah.  So they said, no, no, no.  So I started thinking, wait a minute.  This thing will last about six weeks.  And I pick up this easy money.  And I'll be gone.  Six weeks.  So anyway, we started putting episodes in the can.  And I started having fun with it.  I was lulled into it.  And when we did Chocolate Salt to Balls, 
[03:25:00]  I said, man, y'all sure you don't want to do this shit, man?  I looked out in the studio.  You know, the staff was just cracking up.  All the engineers and stuff.  I said, well, they dig it.  I went on and did that.  And then we got so many in the can.  When the ad day was announced, I said, oh, shit, I'm getting intrepidatious.  Oh, shit, I got to sneak out of town like a flasher.  We're going to send my friends.  But when the thing aired, the ratings went through the roof.  And every subsequent episode after that kept getting high.  And I went to autographs, signed out at a video strip in Connecticut. 
[03:25:30]  The limousine pulled up lines around the block.  I said, hey, man, what are these people here for?  You, Mr. Hayes.  What?  I went inside.  People had Hot Butter Soul albums.  They had Shaft albums.  Be Continued albums, all that kind of stuff.  And then the younger people, they had little kids with their Shaft dolls.  They said, hey, will you sign this T-shirt?  Will you sign around this little shirt right here?  I said, damn.  That's when I realized that South Park had spread my fan base from 6 to 96. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  It took off, man.  Yeah.  And this is our 10th season.  It's amazing.  Would you believe it, man?  Yeah.  It's awesome.  Were you friends with Richard Pryor?  Oh, yeah.  You know?  He got into Richard.  Richard was a very wonderful, generous guy, man.  I'm going to tell you because one time when I was living in Atlanta, I had some financial  problems, and Richard, we had the same limousine driver, and Richard gave me $10,000. 
[03:26:30]  I didn't know who it was.  It was an anonymous donor, and it took me a year.  The limousine driver said, Mr. Hayes, you got money you got about a year?  About a year ago?  That was Richard Pryor.  He didn't want you to know that.  Richard was like that.  Just gave you $10,000?  Yeah.  He was cool.  Damn.  He was cool.  Wow.  He did a lot of things like that, but he just didn't want to make a big fuss of it.  Now, getting back to South Park, on this album, we got three discs on it, two CDs, and the 
[03:27:00]  third disc is a DVD.  It's got footage from Watch Stacks, that big thing that Stacks did in L.A., and so I'm  doing Shaft, Rolling Down the Mountainside in Soulsville, and Chef is doing Chocolate 
[03:27:30]  Salty Balls on the DVD.  On the DVD?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Oh, yeah.  And we also have a lot of tunes on there that were not, you know, released.  I'm singing that.  I'm doing a gospel tune, Operation Push.  I'm singing His Eyes on the Spire.  It's my granddad's favorite song.  I'm doing that.  From Beretta.  Break that down to me. 
[03:28:00]  Break that down.  You got a blanket look on your face, too.  He knows, Anthony knows a little bit about everything, so.  That was the theme song to Beretta.  Oh, he'd be like, ah, ah, ah, ah, that's Sammy Davis.  Oh, the sparrow.  But that's an old gospel song.  Yeah.  That's the latest thing on Beretta.  Wait, that was, uh, he did it originally?  No, Sammy Davis, Jr.  No, Sammy did that.  But you did a version of that, too.  This is not Sammy, too.  No, I'm confused.  This is an old gospel tune. 
[03:28:30]  That's an old gospel tune.  You know, why should I feel discouraged?  You know, like that.  And me and Dion, we did a tour together called A Man and a Woman, and we did a live album at  the Fox Theater in Atlanta, and one of the tunes we did was a unique rendition.  We were doing it at the same time.  I don't know who the hell arranged that, but it was an awesome arrangement.  She did, um, she did, um, what's it?  I said a little prayer for you, and I did it by the time I get to finish, and we sing 
[03:29:00]  it together.  And they worked, uh, together?  It works together, man.  Who the hell thought that would work?  I don't know, but it worked.  And the artist loves it.  And that's on, that's on, that's on, that's on, that's on one of the, one of the CDs.  Yeah.  And a lot of my stuff, I did, I did a tune, uh, uh, instrumental called The Men, because  I scored, uh, a, a trilogy, three different things on television, and, uh, it's called  The Men.  It's awesome. 
[03:29:30]  I mean, it's all kind of goodies on there, man.  Isaac's keeping busy, man.  Yep.  And it's called Can You Dig It?  Yeah.  The ultimate Isaac Hayes.  Yeah, see, Concord Records, uh, bought the, the, the Stacks catalog from Fantasy Records.  And you gave up on, uh, morning radio?  You were doing morning radio here in New York?  Yeah, New York at Kiss FM.  Yeah.  But, you know, after, after 9-11, uh, I, my kids kept saying, come on back home, come  on down, come on back down here, blah, blah, blah.  So, uh, they kept me, uh, a week longer. 
[03:30:00]  No, let me see.  They kept me a month longer, trying to get me to sign up again.  I said, no, I'm going back home.  You were done with it, huh?  Yeah.  Because I had, I got, I got, I got a radio show in Memphis, uh, 103.5.  And, uh, it's just an evening show.  See, morning radio kicked my butt.  I did it for five years, and that kicked my butt.  I loved it.  I really loved it.  We had a great team.  But, um, it's time to go back home.  It's time to go back to Memphis.  All right.  It's Isaac Hayes, the ultimate Isaac Hayes CD and DVD. 
[03:30:30]  It's, uh, Can You Dig It?  It's out in stores right now, right?  Yep.  I think we're going to go to break with chocolate salty balls from you.  Yeah.  All right.  What's up, Ben?  Yeah, I can dig it.  Oh, Ben's just, uh, walking in.  Isaac Hayes, thank you so much.  Thank you.  Hey, fellas, it's been great hanging with you guys, man.  Thanks, man.
