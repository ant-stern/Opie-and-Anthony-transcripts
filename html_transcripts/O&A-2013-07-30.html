<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of their successful live broadcast from Montreal.  They detailed the smooth technical execution, enthusiastic crowds, and enjoyable time spent with various comedians, including Judah, who'd started a petition ("dropthecheckspot.org") to end the practice of interrupting comedy sets for payment.  Anthony recounted his own unexpected eight-minute stand-up performance at a Montreal theater he hosted, a performance later criticized in the Montreal Gazette for his use of "rape" and "rapist" in a joke at a Whitney Cummings gala. The hosts also discussed a successful "dating game" segment featuring Canadian women, one of whom they later had lunch with, and the relaxed atmosphere of Montreal, contrasting it sharply with New York City; they specifically highlighted the prevalent smell of marijuana and the city's orderly pedestrian traffic.  One host had won money at a casino in Montreal, and they also mentioned receiving nice headphones as a thank you gift (though one host lost his).  The show then shifted to a discussion of A-Rod's potential MLB suspension, speculation about its causes (interference with an investigation), and the implications for his home run record chase, leading to a broader debate about performance-enhancing drugs in baseball.  They also briefly discussed a family pool party and comedian Brad Williams.  The entire segment was liberally peppered with profanity and sexually suggestive comments.

The show continued with a caller, Rob, a Marine, advocating for free steroids in sports and the military to enhance excitement.  This sparked a debate about the ethics and effects of steroid use.  Comedian Jimmy then called in, detailing his Montreal performances, including a controversial bit about Paula Deen and racial slurs. He also discussed his changing views on women and his increased masturbation habits.  The hosts expressed their frustration with the cluttered and disorganized studio, blaming management for inaction despite repeated complaints.  The upcoming appearance of Insane Clown Posse (ICP) was heavily anticipated, prompting a discussion of their career, their independent success, their film "Big Money Rustlers," and their cultural impact, with clips from the film being described. A Twitter hater criticizing the steroid discussion was briefly addressed and dismissed.  The hosts then recounted their Montreal experiences, including visits to a strip club, with humorous anecdotes about interactions with dancers and staff, and detailed a photo of Anthony Weiner's accuser. They also made vulgar comments about her appearance.  The show ended with continued discussion of the upcoming ICP interview and mention of Josh Gad as a future guest.


A scathing critique of coworker Mark Zito dominated a large portion of the following segment.  Zito's laziness, unprofessional behavior during the Montreal trip (including refusing to clean up a spill and slow response times), and attempts to gather information to report to their bosses were detailed.  His obsessive behavior around John Mayer was also highlighted, including mimicking Mayer's hat style and constantly wearing a John Mayer hoodie.  The segment then moved to a discussion about the Gathering of the Juggalos, featuring vulgar descriptions of pictures of naked Juggalettes, alongside anticipation for ICP's appearance.   A news story about an oversized KFC bucket on a lawn and a call about the effects of the drug "burundanga" and a related Vice documentary were also discussed.  The New York City mayoral race, particularly Anthony Weiner and Christine Quinn, received highly critical and vulgar commentary. A caller discussed a documentary about a war photographer in Juarez, Mexico, prompting questions about the ethics of prioritizing documentation over helping those in need.  The segment concluded with preparations for ICP's arrival.

The Insane Clown Posse (ICP) were then interviewed, focusing on their career, their decision to forgo major labels, their independent promotional efforts, and their business model. They discussed their experiences with other Detroit artists like Eminem and Kid Rock, their business management structure, and the "Gathering of the Juggalos," including its size, evolution, and negative media portrayals.  Their professional wrestling experiences and film productions, especially their western film, were also covered.  They discussed their viral video "Miracles," their childhoods, and a humorous anecdote about a self-imposed rule regarding naked fistfights to settle workplace disputes. Jim Breuer was also mentioned as a guest at the Gathering of the Juggalos.  The interview was punctuated by profanity.


The show continued with a discussion about a hypothetical diarrhea scenario on a nude survivor-style island, followed by a caller, Charlie, asking about the saturation point of sand in the ocean, sparking a nonsensical discussion about sand, water, and magnets.  ICP was interviewed again; this time focusing on their work ethic, their relationship with their Juggalo fanbase, the viral success (and backlash) of "Miracles," their creative process, and the value of their merchandise, including recalling the lyric "bust a nut in your macaroni."  The broadcast then concluded with a heated, homophobic argument between show intern Mark Zito and Troy, filled with insults and personal attacks, which the hosts attempted to de-escalate unsuccessfully before separating the two to end the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The European Central Bank legte den Referent. 
[00:00:30]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's dang open-handed, only he's dang open-handed.  Stop!  Stop with that shit.  And now, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  William Shatner, by the way, from Montreal.  How great was Montreal, my god.  I've been crowing about it since we got back.  It's kind of depressing to be back here.  Can't we just stay on the road?  People asked how it was, and it was the proverbial, without a hitch.  Yeah, it was.  Without a hitch, it went off.  Too perfect broadcast.  Did you see it like a month ago that we went up there? 
[00:01:30]  Did you see it like a week ago?  I know, right?  It's been a few days.  Yeah.  A few beach days.  Yeah.  It was just amazing.  The show, technically.  Yeah.  It was one of the best live broadcasts we did.  There wasn't one problem.  We didn't have...  Even the smallest of issues didn't pop up, technically.  And then to have a room full of a cool crowd and those comics just made it...  Perfect.  Perfect.  I was kind of looking around for two days going, like, there must be something I can bitch about. 
[00:02:00]  Give me something.  I know.  What the...  What the...  This is very uncomfortable to be so happy.  It's pretty goddamn cool, man.  And then they gave us headphones as we're leaving as a little...  Oh, yeah.  As a little thank you.  I'm like, what do you mean?  We should be thanking you.  Those headphones were nice.  Did you get those headphones?  No.  I think they gave them to me and I asked someone to get them and they're gone.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jimmy.  They're terrific headphones, too.  I want to bring them in here and try them out.  I'm going to keep mine from compound. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, they were good.  The ones that used up there, they were pretty good.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I liked them.  Did you like the headphones?  I remember being fine with them, but I don't remember...  I remember them being very, very good.  Oh, okay.  I love them.  Montreal's a cool place, man.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, it really is.  I did a lot of walking around.  Did you?  Yeah.  They know how to just fucking chill up there.  Every park has some little weird thing happening.  Yeah.  And the smell of pot. 
[00:03:00]  A lot of the weed.  Why is Travis laughing?  Pot smells wonderful.  No, I'm laughing because everybody up there smokes.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, there's a lot of the weed.  Everyone's just walking around being nice and smoking.  Right.  It just makes you want to smoke pot.  I was in a cab at one point and...  The cab you were smoking?  No.  Oh, okay.  But the cab...  Are you allowed to do that?  Are you allowed to smoke and drive?  There was a car in front of us that stopped.  Yeah.  Which left us kind of in an intersection.  Right.  And then another car wanted to go through the intersection and was stopped there. 
[00:03:30]  Waiting for us to move.  And that was waiting for the car in front.  And I'm just sitting there fucking...  I'm starting to boil.  I'm just looking like the...  If I was that guy, I'd fucking be given...  Oh, right.  Not a hunk.  No, they don't care, man.  They just waited.  But it was nice.  I know.  Didn't you just go with it?  Yes.  The restaurant you picked that one night, the steak joint?  What was it called?  Moishe's.  Moishe's.  Moishe's.  It was terrific.  Very good.  They call it Moishe's.  We walked home from there.  And I'm thinking it's going to be a really long walk.  It wasn't that far from the hotel. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Because the ride up was exactly what you're talking about.  It was bumper to bumper.  No one making any moves.  No moves.  No horns.  Nothing.  And I decided to go, you know what?  Just fucking go with it.  Relax.  Who cares?  It was pretty damn cool.  I didn't hear one honking of the horn.  No honking horn.  No fucking yelling on a street corner.  People fighting or screaming about shit.  It was amazing.  Well, the one thing you're not allowed to do is cross the street, though.  Unless that fucking walking sign is illuminated. 
[00:04:30]  Is that a biggie?  Yeah.  A couple of our guys saw four people just get yanked to the side because they attempted it.  By traffic cops or whatever the hell they're called up there.  And then I made a move and there was two homeless people like, oh boy, you shouldn't be doing that.  Oh, you're a crazy rebel.  And I'm looking at them like, well, maybe you shouldn't be doing what you're doing.  Oh, man.  But I guess you're not. 
[00:05:00]  Didn't you notice no one fucking walks until it's time?  I didn't even notice then.  Because like in New York, you look, if there's no fucking traffic, you're not waiting for any fucking time to walk signs.  But up there, they hold their spots and wait it out.  That's it.  You've got to wait just like it's a light.  That's the only thing that drove me a little nuts.  But besides that, Montreal is a great place.  I mean, why rush, right?  Right.  Why rush?  Just hang out.  Just wait for that light.  I was watching a punk band, doing it in French. 
[00:05:30]  I'm like, what?  How do you sing in French?  A little French thing.  We were also lucky enough to be up there during mural festivals.  So there was all sorts of street art everywhere.  I love the street art.  Really cool.  Your wife turned me out to some street art.  Yeah, she found some real cool stuff.  She told me exactly where it was.  So on the way home from the steak joint, we stopped and took a whole bunch of pictures.  It's on my Instagram.  Some fucking great artwork.  Holy shit.  Yeah, there was time to fucking, you know, hang out.  But I know places.  It's nice.  But in this park, they're doing, it's a punk band. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, what?  What are they singing about?  Oh.  But it sounded great.  In France.  I couldn't tell you one word they sang, though.  In Francais.  And they're all dancing and smoking pot and they're petting their dogs.  How was Judah about the vagary, though?  I couldn't not notice that.  I couldn't not.  Judah's a weirdo.  When Judah first started talking about it, I'm like, all right, what the fuck is he talking  about?  And then I got it.  And he was like, yes.  And then you realize how vague everyone is up there.  His concepts are, I'm not sure if they're brilliant or just, or if he's just a weirdo. 
[00:06:30]  I think he's brilliant.  I think he's brilliant, too, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  But he comes up with these things.  At first, you're thinking, what?  And then you let it sink in.  You're like, wow, that's pretty fucking smart.  That's some smart shit right there.  Yeah.  He picked up on something that.  I got asked the one question.  Someone has to ask.  The drop the check thing, was that a bit?  No.  No, but he's...  Oh, see?  I didn't know.  Hilarious.  He just fucking went off on that.  That wasn't a bit.  No.  For a second, I thought, okay, he got us. 
[00:07:00]  That's a bit.  No.  I don't think so.  No, no.  I think he...  I went to the website when he was talking about it.  It's not a bit.  No?  He really is trying to get comedy clubs across America to not drop the checks while the comedian's  still doing his set.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm sitting there the whole time.  I was really confused.  Like, a lot of people going, wait, is this a bit?  No, he has 653 signatures on his petition.  Okay.  At dropthecheckspot.org.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  But the vagary, why?  Did you run into some of that after Drew said it?  The whole time about getting sets and set times and everything in stone and trying to  find out when I was on the gala, they won't tell you anything.  Well, no, we don't.  You know, we haven't really done that yet.  Oh, wow.  I want to rip my face off.  Yeah, there's no commitment to anything.  And they wouldn't tell me anything.  And the night before I do the gala, I bumped into Whitney Cummings.  I'm like, did they tell you anything?  She's like, yeah, yeah, I have the list.  Then she showed me the list.  It was fine.  Right.  I was like, why couldn't they just do that?  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  It's so weird how they don't want to tell you things up there.  No, they don't.  They don't want to just give you information.  It is odd.  Yes or no.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  Dude, they're not definitive at all.  Like, Americans are probably seen as very aggressive, like fucking ABP.  They don't fucking do that.  They don't even have a fucking language commitment.  No.  No.  It's English.  It's French.  Ah, whatever.  Whatever.  But the brilliance of that I was thinking about as I was walking around.  Yeah, because you stop for a coffee or a little lunch or something, and they all start with  bonjour.  Because that, I guess, is the prominent one. 
[00:08:30]  They really are trying to push up there.  Uh-huh.  And if you go, hi, then they switch to English.  Like, this whole city is bilingual.  How cool is that?  It is amazing.  That's, that's, try to wrap your head around that.  Yeah.  Imagine you're a little hometown, if everyone in your hometown spoke two languages.  I know.  Miami.  Yeah.  There's not many places, is my point.  Bonjour.  It is pretty amazing.  They go, bonjour.  Yeah.  And then you go, hi.  And then, oh, okay.  Oh, you're one of them.  A dirty American.  Ah, hello.  May I help you? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  We got to go back.  We got to make that an annual thing.  That was great.  I think so, right?  I think everyone is on the same page.  But of course.  Comics are great.  Just trying to keep the positive energy from Montreal.  But I do want to say that he will fuck it up, and we will not be in Montreal next year.  Oh.  I just know.  I just know.  I didn't get an inkling that you guys liked it.  I just know it has to be said.  It was a perfect broadcast, perfect two days.  You know, in general, people loved the shows. 
[00:09:30]  I shouldn't even say in general.  I think overwhelmingly people loved the shows.  People loved it.  We should do more than two days next year.  With all the comedians that are there.  Yeah, I think we could do two, three days easy.  Yeah, I would definitely do three after every day.  Three days, maybe.  Comics was so much fun, man, to have there.  We had like eight comics on two couches.  Every mic worked.  Oh, it was perfect.  And no one was really talking over each other.  No, no.  That's the tough thing when you've got a room full of funny people and microphones on.  You've got to take your time before you bash DeRosa. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, my God.  You know, everyone knew it's a stand-in line.  I think the small crowds helped.  The fact that we did like 50 people, because it's usually so crazy for these things.  Right.  We actually did like a regular show.  I remember, like, Ann was talking about something.  It was something that the news was.  Yeah, yeah.  We normally couldn't do this during a live event.  Yeah.  Like, it was just a normal chat about something.  No, the people were really, really respectful of the fact that there was a broadcast going  on.  And when we wanted them to be involved, they were.  You know, it wasn't some fucking waiting.  You fucking fuck, fuck. 
[00:10:30]  Jesus.  What?  What do you want?  I know.  Are you a fan?  Yeah.  I don't even know.  I saw the heads of the festival, the two guys that were really way in charge of it,  like, the last night.  And they asked how it was.  And I told them it was great.  And they said, yeah, we heard everything went really well.  So it's like, you know, people knew that the broadcast went well.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think the festival was very happy with it.  I know we were.  Yeah.  It was great.  The fucking, uh, and what was that, Friday night?  We had a great time at the, um, the, what the hell is the name of that place? 
[00:11:00]  The Secret Show.  Oh, the, uh, St. Catherine's Theater.  Yeah, yeah.  St. Catherine's Theater.  That was a lot of fun, too, man.  Anthony did stand-up.  Oh, my God.  He did stand-up.  By himself.  Did he try, did just, did stand-up.  Dude, they, fuck it, the woman comes up and she's like, okay, um, well, you go up and  you, you, you do eight minutes.  I'm like, fucking eight minutes.  And then she's writing all the other comics down and she's like, eight minutes, eight minutes.  I'm like, the fuck are you kidding me? 
[00:11:30]  See, we just did eight minutes here.  This is easy.  Oh.  But what Jimmy does, eight minutes on a stage, that's like.  Oh, my God.  Oh, were you just having an anxiety attack?  I was like, ah.  I had to beat it out of, I had to beat it out of Montreal and you and Jimmy did the gig.  Yeah, it was, uh, it was fun.  So did he do well?  Yeah, it was really, like, I, I, I.  Did you do bits?  What, what'd you do for eight minutes?  I talked a little bit about Montreal.  I'm not saying you can't pull it off.  I didn't.  Of course you could pull it off, but that, wow. 
[00:12:00]  Okay.  I don't even remember.  You just went with it.  It was just kind of.  Did he get laughs?  Popping up.  Yeah.  He did definitely get laughs.  Nice.  Good for you, brother.  And it was weird.  It was, uh.  You should have done that a long time ago.  That's fucking weird.  Because I knew you weren't there, so it was like, Ant, me and Ant going up, we could have  done, but it felt more like, well, if it's not Opie and Anthony, fucking Anthony can do  it.  Let him go up there and just talk and bullshit and fucking, you know what I mean?  And it was like, it worked well.  I knew it would work.  It was cold, definitely. 
[00:12:30]  But I think in some ways it's easier, too, because when we do these live gigs, they always  want us to do like a fucking, you know, I don't know, Martin and Lewis or something.  I know, right?  It's like, it almost is easier if you're just up there by yourself.  Not to take away from what you did by any stretch, trust me.  Not at all, but it's like weird.  But sometimes it does feel a little easier when you just go up by yourself.  Just have like top hats and two canes and do one of those.  Right, right.  Well, then you're looking at the other guy, like, oh, okay, I gotta get him involved. 
[00:13:00]  It's my turn to talk.  Wait, is it his or my turn?  I don't fucking know.  That's funny.  You guys fucking like killed those.  It was so much fun.  I was cracking up.  It was a good show.  It was, you know, but it was more, but the favorite part was watching you go up there  for, like, he's a guy who's never done stand-up before.  Right.  Like, ever.  And just to see you riffing, and what did you say?  You're like, I'll Zimmerman you.  You had a couple of real funny ones.  And then he was just kind of goofing on the comics as they came and went and going back 
[00:13:30]  and forth, but it was, uh...  Wait, you had a host?  He hosted.  Wait, you had to do eight minutes and host?  Yeah, he hosted the whole show.  It was crazy.  That's what I was saying.  I'm like, what?  I gotta go up?  Do we have any audio of that?  Between every comic?  No, I mean, unless somebody recorded.  Oh, my God.  Sam and I...  That's not the deal we made.  It was crazy.  Because that's not our, like, our strength.  I know.  Holy fuck, I'm having anxiety, and I didn't have to do it.  Well, you didn't have to do anything in between.  Like, the host, it is acceptable for the host to go, come on, have a hand for Colin.  Yeah, yeah.  Your next acts are good. 
[00:14:00]  He literally could have just done that.  Oh, wow.  You know.  Oh, I wish I could see video of this.  Someone had to have filmed it.  Yeah, it was crazy.  How about the guy that was filming our radio show, and Gary had a fucking...  The guy was so excited, like...  Oh, was he ever.  He'll never see us again, because he's from that area.  Maybe, I mean, if we come back next year.  Yeah.  He's filming the show from the audience.  Like, it's not even going to be a good quality video, and Gary shuts him down.  He tweeted me.  He was like, hope I didn't get you guys in trouble.  Some friends will come over. 
[00:14:30]  He'll be like, hey, dude, check this out.  They'll watch, like, two seconds of it.  That's it.  That's all he has.  What's he going to do with it?  God, I mean, whatever.  The Grateful Dead made a living letting their fans film the shows.  Of course, Pearl Jam's doing it.  But we can't.  No.  We're so valuable, you can't film us.  Don't film us.  While we're doing a radio show?  What is wrong with these people?  Oh, God.  What did he think would happen with that?  I think that it's going to go somewhere, and it's going to cut into their profits. 
[00:15:00]  How?  I don't know.  It's getting paid content for free.  I don't know.  How?  That's what they think, though.  I would almost see it if, like, we did a lot of live broadcasts, and every single live  broadcast, there was a guy with a high-quality setup.  Right.  Then I could see their point.  Yeah, high-quality.  Right, exactly.  But a guy has his camera down near his crotch, hoping to catch a couple funny lines.  Yeah, that's all.  Jesus.  All that would do is make people want to listen to the show if it's funny.  Yes.  Yeah.  It only does that.  It's only good.  Especially since the material's different every day. 
[00:15:30]  If you give away one day, it's just going to make people want more.  I think so.  If you give away music, there's only one album.  There's one Metallica Black album.  Right.  This is different every day, so people aren't going to hear it and go, well, I've heard  the one show.  Yeah, I heard their show.  They'll be like, I want to hear more of it.  It changes every day.  Of course.  Of course.  We're not a band.  We have one album that comes out every five years, so all those songs are so valuable.  I could see that could be a problem if a live version of a song is online or something. 
[00:16:00]  Let me say hi to Jeff in Massachusetts.  Jeff.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  How much did you love Brad Williams?  I think he's hilarious.  I love Brad.  Yeah, that thing came about out of nowhere.  Jay Moore just texted me.  I thought you were calling him a thing.  I thought you were going to say, that thing was funny.  Jesus.  Jay texted me and said, you've got to follow Brad Williams.  I'm like, all right.  I trust Jay.  And then it turned out he was up there, and he was just sitting in on the show. 
[00:16:30]  And we met him.  I'm like, fuck, do some time on the couch.  Let's see how it goes.  And he killed.  Yeah, it was good.  He was the midget comic, just so people know.  Huh?  He has a great podcast about last night with Adam Ray.  He's another phenomenal comedian out of Los Angeles.  And I really don't care for Los Angeles-based comedians.  I'm more of an East Coast guy.  But those two are very funny and have a great podcast.  It depends on where they're from, too.  Most LA comics are transplants, like from somewhere. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Very few are born and bred in Los Angeles.  It's like with Vegas people.  Usually they come from somewhere else.  Yeah.  But Brad was at the Nasty Show, and I saw him the night before.  And we said hello and everything.  And we didn't know each other well, but it was just casual.  And he goes, yeah, Opie follows me on Twitter.  That was what he said to me.  I'm like, all right.  That just happened.  I mean, the whole thing went down only a couple days ago.  Yeah, he might have even said, Opie just started following me.  He's a bit pushy.  Yeah.  He's a bit pushy.  But if you're two and a half feet tall, I guess you've got to be.  You learn.  How many times can you run through the dog door and yell, surprise? 
[00:17:30]  Right.  But he said, what are you guys broadcasting?  I'm going to come by.  He was really.  That's what I mean by being pushy.  He went from Jay told me to follow him because he's a funny guy to he's starring on our show  the next day.  He's a bit pushy.  That's funny.  But he was a fun dude, man.  He was really cool.  I heard he destroyed.  I saw some video of his closing.  And there's him and then there's Amy's old opener, who is, oh my God, I know her name. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, Bridget.  Right.  Who was on the show, on the Nasty Show.  Wow.  What a fuck.  And Jimmy Carr went on right in between them.  Holy shit.  And it was amazing to me how he just didn't give a fuck about following either one of them.  He's amazing, this guy.  Let me ask you something.  He was great.  Yeah, he was very good.  Oh, Jimmy Carr?  Yeah.  He was really good.  I wish we had him on.  What happened?  Yeah, he'll come on.  He just fought.  There's a time thing that happened?  I think so.  But he was completely confused by his publicist gave him the wrong name.  Oh, that's awesome.  Very apologetic.  I think half of them just drink and don't want to do it in the morning.  Like, I think Eddie Izzard and a lot of those guys, they're out until fucking five in the 
[00:18:30]  morning at parties and they don't want to get up at a festival.  So we should just do Afternoon Drive next time.  Fuck.  We could do that, too.  Why not?  Or do a weird noon show that plays all day.  I mean, you know, with the On Demand app and our own channel, you'll get it.  I think Afternoon Drive would have been a good idea.  I want to ask you about Brad Williams.  So, obviously, he's a midget.  He talks about it more than anyone else.  So you've got to work that into your stand-up.  And then when does he do the crossover where now he's just a funny fucking dude on stage? 
[00:19:00]  Right.  How does that work, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I'm asking you.  I was asking him.  Oh.  I asked him that because I'm wondering.  Because he would be.  I'm sorry.  But the second part of the question, because I'm not a question, but a statement.  He would be considered a hack if he did 45 minutes on just being a midget.  Yeah.  It's really hard to say because it's the first thing everybody sees.  You've got to address it, right?  You have to do that.  Okay.  And there's a lot of them.  You don't see that.  It's like black comics you see a lot of or fat comics or women or men.  You don't see that many. 
[00:19:30]  I think he's a dwarf.  I'm not sure what the technically he is.  But you don't see that many guys doing stand-up.  No.  So for a while, people do want to hear about things from your, I hate to say, point of view.  But they do want to hear from you about, like, all right, we've heard a million midget jokes and short jokes.  But, like, what's it like from that fucking side of the fence?  Right.  So I don't know what the right amount is.  He can probably do a lot more.  Or I think it would be a lot less annoying to hear him doing short jokes than it would be to hear a black comic doing the same black jokes or Irish doing the same Irish jokes. 
[00:20:00]  Because we've seen a lot of guys doing that.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I've never seen him do a full set, but I'd be interested to.  Like, I've never seen him do a half hour.  But for ten minutes, you can do one subject and people won't get sick of it.  People want to know if we had any problems with the language since Canada is so strict.  No, I don't know how that works.  No, no.  Because there was some rape jokes on our show.  Oh, yeah.  I got the Montreal Gazette did not enjoy my material on the gala.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  No.  But they wrote you up.  They didn't.  It was a very weird.  Where's the article?  Yeah, it was the day after the gala.  And some guy Twittered me, and he goes, hey, man, this bitch said you were the one.  He called her a company.  The one low light of the evening on Whitney's gala.  So I was like, oh, fuck.  Actually, I had a really good set.  Who was the lineup?  Whitney hosted.  Right.  I can't remember the order, but it was myself, Doug Davidov, Neil Brennan, a Canadian guy  whose name I don't remember.  I have the names here.  Oh, you got them. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  Jim Norton.  Damien Lemon.  Mm-hmm.  Bridget Everett.  Yes.  Catherine Ryan.  Derek Seguin.  I think he was.  He's Canadian, yeah.  I was pronouncing that.  Dove Davidov and Neil Brennan.  And this was the HBO thing?  No, whatever their HBO is.  Right, right.  But it didn't go out live like it did last year.  It was shot and it was taped.  And what she said about me, it wasn't like a bad review.  I was like ready to get trashed.  The low light was.  She's like, I don't like.  And is it right there?  Oh, you got it.  Low lights. 
[00:21:30]  Call me a prude, but I am not a fan of bits that work off the words rape and rapist.  I can appreciate the craft used by Jim Norton.  He was talking about how most women like men with big energy, but I have rapist energy.  She's quoting me.  That's the quote.  But not for me.  So it wasn't a, but it was like, that's almost.  Her cup of tea.  She's allowed to say that.  She's not shitting on me.  Her opinion.  She is allowed to say that, but.  She did say I'm not a fan.  Yeah.  Not that you shouldn't be doing it.  Yeah.  That's all.  That's perfectly legit.  It's silly though to get so, what annoys me about it. 
[00:22:00]  She's pushing some feminism in there though, which bothers me.  Why don't you just be a fucking, you know, a critic for comedy.  Well, it wasn't even a rape joke.  I know, but she's putting her personal fucking feminism in there, I think.  It was like, it wasn't even a, that's what bugs me about it.  It's like, it wasn't a rape joke.  Like, not that I wouldn't do one, but that joke was just about, I talk about being insecure  and fucking frightened of meeting women.  So it comes off as menacing.  Right.  It's like, I'm just saying, but the mere, the word rape.  Yeah, that wasn't even a rape joke. 
[00:22:30]  You're right.  Like, come on, you gotta be a big girl or a big boy when you're listening to live stand-up.  Because guys are talking about murder.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And drunk driving and.  Right, that's not her cup of tea, you know, but murder and stuff.  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  But the word rape sets you off, regardless of context.  Unless, of course, the news is using it, then it's acceptable.  Yeah.  But she did say, I can appreciate the craft and it's just not for me.  So it's like, you can't be mad because.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to bash her on that.  Yeah, she's not.  She's not saying he shouldn't do it or be allowed to do it.  But, you know, I guess people want to know what happened with the two girls that we did 
[00:23:00]  the dating game with.  Exactly what I knew would happen.  Exactly.  I'm never wrong about that stuff.  Complete blow off.  No, they were both Canada from Canadian girls.  I've never had amazing success with.  It's kind of like it's like a foreign country of Philly was a foreign country.  There's so many.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on?  Va tu faire foutre? 
[00:23:30]  Si vous plaît?  That's pretty good.  But I like certain markets for me, like Boston girls I love.  Philly girls I've struck out horribly with, historically.  They make you think they like you.  They're nothing.  That's how it is in Canada.  So I knew that the dating game, the girl I picked was the one who was the bigger fan.  From Toronto.  Yeah, but I knew.  Remember I said to you, I'm going to go with the other girl?  And Ant convinced me, and Colin in the brain.  I think you did, too.  You got to go with that. 
[00:24:00]  Colin's like, she fucking flew here for you.  I'm like, she didn't.  So I picked her.  Now, it turns out she had flown in to see the festival and was very happy that we were  going to be there, which is okay.  And we went to lunch.  Oh, she wasn't a fan fan?  Oh, she was a hardcore fan, but she didn't fly in for that.  She was in for the festival, and then we just happened to, and she was very psyched.  All right, so it all just worked out.  Gotcha.  And then we went out to lunch, and we had a nice lunch.  Oh, so she at least went out to lunch.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that's all you want right now.  She was a nice girl.  You just want a few lunch dates. 
[00:24:30]  But, yeah.  Then once you're on lunch.  Of course.  But as soon as lunch was done, she went her way, and I went up and took a nap.  Was there a little peck?  A little kiss?  A little thank you for lunch kiss?  Yeah, I got a little hug goodbye, but I was ready to shake hands.  But she was, again, I can't trash her, because she just showed up for a live radio show.  She didn't show up to be sodomized.  So the fact that she didn't want to be ass-fucked by a guy is fair enough.  And she did go to lunch.  I can't shake a woman's hand ever. 
[00:25:00]  No?  No.  How do you do?  How do you do?  It's either like a little wave or deep penetration.  You can't, you can't.  Balls deep.  I don't know, man.  Do you shake women's hands in general?  It's very rare.  It's very business.  It's strange when it happens, right?  Business-like thing.  Yeah.  You know.  But certainly not a fan of the show.  I wouldn't be able to just shake their hand like that.  Yeah.  Then I'm fucking, you know, leading with my balls.  Hey!  Right.  Grind against their leg. 
[00:25:30]  Hmm.  Playing soccer today.  They're outside playing soccer now.  I don't know what happened.  This is like, I've been around long enough to know that they're just doing morning zoo shit now on Fox News.  Every day.  Fox and Friends, they're just doing morning zoo crap.  They're playing soccer as they wear their ties.  Yeah, he's got all his mic equipment on.  That shit's stupid.  Like, look at me.  I'm getting through.  Could you see us doing that?  Like, no.  Oh, a little physical contact.  And she's in our high heels.  She's in our high heels. 
[00:26:00]  She's playing goalies in high heels.  And he scored.  He should have kicked.  Imagine if he just drilled it right into her face.  Fucking as hard as he could kick it right into her face, she would be, yeah.  Broke her nose.  Devastated.  That's how we would do it.  Oh, my nose.  Just to keep it fun.  Yeah.  Sure.  And look, no one goes there to even check it out.  Like, they're playing soccer in the middle of New York and no one cares.  I think they're trying to push that Fox 1 sports thing that's coming up.  What's that?  They've got a sports channel.  Fox is going to steal that.  There's not enough of those.  It's good.  He's going to delve into that.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  How does any one of these channels get an audience?  There's too many.  Regis has a show on there.  Regis.  What's he talking about sports?  Notre Dame all the time.  That's all I talk about.  That's the only offer he got, huh?  He doesn't want to be talking sports.  He wants to talk maybe a little sports.  He doesn't want to be doing a sports show.  Sports show.  That was the only offers he got after he held out, huh?  18 days.  It's going on with A-Rod.  What is going on?  I don't know.  Well, A-Rod is just showing the whole world how much of a dick he is because they're about 
[00:27:00]  to ban him.  He's done.  And he said he's going to fight.  And now they're saying that Sealy could just say, nope, sorry, I'm banning you.  Yeah, they could pull out that little rule that says if you're doing something that's  detrimental to the game, you know?  Affecting the integrity of the game.  The integrity of baseball.  They could throw you the fuck out permanently. 
[00:27:30]  Unless you're an owner.  And Sealy, yeah, exactly.  He would be suspended under the collective bargaining agreement and not for steroids.  When was the last time that, you know, the commissioner did this?  I don't think ever.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Wow, they hate A-Rod.  They fucking hate him.  He's out to get A-Rod.  Like, that's all this is.  So why hasn't it happened yet?  Because they're just preparing.  Legal wrangling.  They're just making sure that all the I's are dotted and the T's are crossed. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  Because this has, this is much more to do with A-Rod interfering in the investigation  than it has to do with him taking drugs.  Gotcha.  What did he do in the investigation to interfere?  He allegedly...  He interfered.  Yeah, he intimidated witnesses.  He tried to...  By how?  What, did he threaten to play for their team?  He...  I'll D-H for the...  Oh, no!  He tried to get, you know, evidence and destroy evidence and...  Oh.  So he...  He did what any of us would have done.  Right. 
[00:28:30]  Of course.  Exactly.  Every report I've read, baseball has a mountain of evidence against it.  But it's taking forever.  That's the weird part.  I just think they're being incredibly careful.  Do they want to blow it?  Oh, yeah.  It's so unprecedented.  Like, at best, I've heard, at best, he'll be suspended for the rest of this year and  all of next year.  Yeah, I heard he can't come back until 2015.  That's the very least.  And then he'll be a 40-year-old on two surgically replaced hips who hasn't played baseball in  two years.  And he can't fucking take what he took to hit home.  But what's his home run thing? 
[00:29:00]  Because there was a shot of him breaking the record.  Yeah, if he hadn't gotten injured, if he had stayed...  He would have done it.  Of course, I definitely think he would have beaten Barry Bonds, yeah.  But with the drugs, though, right?  How many behind is he?  I don't know.  But it's like, how much do drugs really help?  You know?  Like, you still have to hit a baseball from, you know...  In a split second, you have to determine where the ball's going, how fast it's going.  The argument to that is, and I kind of agree, I don't care what these guys take, but if  you have the hand-eye coordination, most of those guys have that. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  How many guys bat 280 lifetime or 260 lifetime and have...  You don't count deep fly-outs.  Like, how many guys would have had that extra 50 feet?  I'm not saying it doesn't help.  But, you know, he still would have been one of the greatest ballplayers ever.  Caught on the warning track.  Caught on the warning track.  That one to the warning track.  Caught on the warning track.  Like, all those would have been home runs.  Right.  What Babe Ruth did was amazing because nobody was doing it.  I mean, he was hitting more home runs than teams. 
[00:30:00]  A-Rod is in fifth place right now with 647 homers all time.  Yeah, he's just under, what has he got here?  A little over 115 behind Barry Bonds, it looks like, right?  And then fucking...  Yeah, 115 homers.  He would have done that.  Golden boy Jeter fucking comes off the DL, steps up to the plate, first pitch, wham, out  of the fucking place.  Little wave.  Hi, everybody.  I'm back.  There's a home run for you.  You know, it was quite a day.  Jeter hit a home run.  Soriano got the game-winning RBI. 
[00:30:30]  Mariano Rivera saved the game.  It was 10 years ago.  10 years ago.  I was going to add, Ortiz, you know, took out a phone.  Oh, yeah, that was great.  In almost his player's head.  He was very angry.  The Yankees of 2003 looked very good.  Yes, yes.  Well, everyone knows A-Rod's in deep fucking trouble, but I'm just wondering when they're  going to finally do it.  It could be today.  Oh, you think?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's coming down this week, you think, Travis?  It's absolutely coming this week.  His lawyer says he's appealing any decision, but an appeal could cost him the rest of his 
[00:31:00]  career.  Yeah, and that's why C-League would suspend him under the collective bargaining agreement,  because you can't play while you're appealing under that suspension.  If you appeal a drug suspension, you can play while the appeal is going on.  Why can't you appeal a play during the other one?  Collective bargaining.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  It's just the rule of what they set up.  I don't know.  What does it mean to collective bargaining?  How are they suspending him on collective bargaining? 
[00:31:30]  Is it because he interfered with the integrity of the game?  Yeah, by...  I don't know the exact words to use, but somebody that is interfering with the integrity of the  So if they suspend you, say, for your suspected pedophile, or there's good evidence that you  raped somebody and you just haven't been convicted yet, you're not going to play through.  Exactly.  They could suspend you under the collective bargaining.  Okay.  So who has a chance at the home run record now?  Because A-Rod's out.  I thought Rod Carew had it.  That's just it.  Who's the next guy that's still playing? 
[00:32:00]  I don't know, because every time you think it's going to be somebody, it ends up not being somebody.  Everybody thought, well, Albert Pujols is going to be the greatest player ever,  and he goes to Los Angeles and hasn't done much.  Without the fucking steroids, no one's doing that anymore.  There's no real fucking crack, McGuire, and fucking Sosa just launching balls over the wall.  It's amazing, though.  You take a little supplement or a little needle, and the next thing you know, you're hitting  these fucking monster home runs.  Fucking holiday ham arms. 
[00:32:30]  Of course, you still have to have the skills, but someone in a lab goes, okay, you got the  skills now, all right.  Yeah, he's measuring it out just perfectly.  Add some power.  That's pretty fucked up.  Yeah.  Why can't they take them, though?  Part of me is like, why can't they?  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, me neither.  Made for great games.  I don't know him personally.  I mean, when I, nah, it's this old gag, but it's the truth.  When you go to a sporting event, you want to see some shit go down.  I don't give a fuck what they're doing in their bodies if you get to see a 550-foot fucking  home run hitting your car in the parking lot. 
[00:33:00]  And what's the difference between that and he goes to the gym and works out every day?  He's eating right.  Right.  He's doing things to better.  Go to the gym.  Eating better.  And he's like, what's the difference between that and you do a few drugs?  The children, I guess.  Is it about the children?  But what of the children?  The children.  Yeah.  Is it the children thing?  The children.  You got to worry about the children.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  If you want to worry about the children, how about you make a baseball game affordable? 
[00:33:30]  Because that puts a lot of stress on daddy and everybody else.  Yeah.  Very, very expensive.  I think that has lasting, way more lasting effects than, you know, a stupid fucking home  run slugger, you know, eating horse shit so he could hit home runs further.  Yeah.  I had the children over my house yesterday in the pool.  A lot of the children.  It was a big day for the Tefts. 
[00:34:00]  The Teft family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a good pool day.  Little Riley swam for the first time without her floaties on.  Whoa.  Yeah.  She decided to just throw them off.  It was so funny to watch a kid almost drowning.  Like, I was so stressed out watching because she'd be swimming, but the water's going over  her nose just enough, though.  She gets her nose down, breathes a little, and her eyes are dying.  She's like, ah!  I was like, oh, my God.  The kid's dying.  My pool.  It was cool.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:34:30]  That was crazy.  We were laughing.  Everyone loves Anthony's pool.  Oh, who doesn't?  Right?  Yep.  Yeah.  The kids made a slide.  They make my white trash slide.  They make...  They take the...  You know the floating mats that you just lay down on in the pool?  They take those and put them from the jacuzzi down the waterfall into the pool and then  slide down.  Good for them.  It's like...  Yeah.  I mean, if he's not going to build a slide...  Right.  They're going to have to do it themselves.  Yeah.  The Lord of the Flies fucking kids building shit. 
[00:35:00]  Well, here we got a...  Oh!  John's going to explain steroids to everybody.  Steroids.  Because we don't know this.  No, we don't.  Go ahead, John and Philly.  Well, just, you know, I mean, I've looked at weights all my life since I was 13.  I've got a ton of friends who have done steroids.  So do we.  He's in the other room.  There it is.  Welcome back.  Now that we're in our mid-40s, I have them, they're getting their hips replaced, they're  having an organ failure.  So there's no doubt. 
[00:35:30]  Here's the problem.  The problem is, if you let other people do steroids in baseball, it's the guys who are  clean who are getting affected by it.  They can't make the money.  It's not fair to them.  It really doesn't make sense.  But it's not...  It's not fair to me.  Thank you.  It's not fair to the fans.  I'd like to play.  No, not even fans.  I'd like to play.  Hey, it's not fair to me that you guys are better than me.  So that should be the norm.  You either take steroids or you go do something else with your life.  Because the fans want to see it. 
[00:36:00]  Stop.  Why are you saying...  Hold on, John.  I'm not even fucking joking, so stop with the stop.  Fans want to see some crazy shit if they're going to a game.  What you're saying is ludicrous.  Not really.  Because I don't care about them.  Next thing you know, you want an amped up bat so you can see a power run.  Then just go see a fire run.  Dude, if you're making 10 million a year to play, you know, to do a job 10 minutes a  day on the field, then I want to see some shit go down. 
[00:36:30]  I want robot bats.  Hold up.  Come on, John.  Let's go with this.  Where'd he go?  What'd he hang up for?  He's very insulted.  I understand, you know, morally and all that.  But, I mean, as a fan, when you go to the game, you want to see the guy, if it's a basketball  game, you want to see him score 60, 70, 80 fucking points.  You want to see him jump completely over another guy because he's taking some shit.  I don't need goody-two-shoes athletes.  Nope.  I want world records.  I want massive home runs. 
[00:37:00]  And I want a football player to get paralyzed every once in a while because they're hitting  so goddamn hard.  So, what happened, Jimmy?  So, this went from, believe it or not, a handshake to A-Rod somehow.  I don't know.  Oh, on the...  I'm back to the dates.  Oh, right.  So, there was a little hand.  Did you shake her hand after lunch?  Yeah, and then she's like, oh, give me a hug.  So, we hugged.  And, again, she was really nice.  So, then I went and I gave her a hug.  And then the other girl I was texting with. 
[00:37:30]  And she was nice.  She would have hung out.  Oh, man.  But we wound up...  I never wound up connecting with her.  Because I napped.  And, again, I was so busy trying to get sets to get this gala set.  I was getting two sets a night, if I could, to try to prepare.  Right.  And I actually have Lennon this Friday, so I had to work out that material.  Which, you know what I mean?  I'm trying to...  It's like I had shit I had to do.  Yeah.  So, then we went out on...  What night did we all go out?  Oh, that was sex night.  Friday.  Yeah.  That was Friday night.  Friday night.  Sex night.  How was sex night?  Went to a strip club.  How were the strip clubs up there? 
[00:38:00]  It looked a little weird that they're like...  The girls were a little chunky.  They were chunky.  A couple of them.  Well, there was...  There were a couple of very attractive girls in there.  Yeah.  But, uh, there's some really chunky girls walking around.  Where'd you guys go?  Some...  One of them...  Just one of them on the fucking...  Yeah.  One of them on the...  They say, like, contact dance.  The lap dances up there, honestly, are very sexy because you can touch them.  It's like...  It's what you want an American strip club to be. 
[00:38:30]  But I'll say for the record, as a rule, there is nothing worse than the breath of a Canadian stripper.  Oh, wow.  Fuck.  What happened?  Fucking...  It was...  That's some other guy's gum.  Oh, God.  Dude, at least I would have recognized that.  This was some weird fetid...  Fetid?  Like, flu growth breath.  Oh, Jesus.  And when she's grinding on me, she gave a great lap dance, and she's like, do you get any gum?  Like, I gave her gum, and it's still... 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  It was like throwing a Tic Tac into a pile of elephant shit.  Really?  Oh, it was...  Oh, my God.  And then I got a couple other girls, and the little hot one that I got, and they were sexy,  and their breath smelled great.  But then there was another one I got who had like that...  You know, it's a weird dry cigarette breath, end of the night liquor.  It's not the sexy little smoky breath you can get.  It was dry cigarette.  It was like fucking what you think Edgar's breath should smell like. 
[00:39:30]  And she had a big fat puss, and she was one of the chunky ones, but I could only do one  dance with her.  She was playing with my nips, and she was really sexy.  Oh, man.  A trooper, but you couldn't do it.  Yeah.  And I interrupted one of Anthony's dances by mistake.  Oh, that was hilarious.  He just looks over the little boothy thing.  Hi.  That's Chip.  Hi.  Yeah.  I was like, what are you guys doing in there?  Yeah, what are you doing in there?  What's going on?  Fucking laughing my ass off.  That's really funny.  That was funny.  But there was only like fucking five girls dancing. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, there wasn't that many girls.  It was empty.  For a Friday night, it was empty.  Just when you walk around Montreal, it's just those black doors, and you don't know if  you should go in or not.  I don't know what's going on.  And then they're on the second floor, which I found a little strange.  I go upstairs.  I didn't...  They looked...  I don't know what they looked like.  Seedy.  Seedy, right?  Yes.  Seedy.  Seedy could be a word for it.  I guess, but...  Seedy.  It didn't feel welcoming.  Mm-hmm.  Like when you walk around New York, you got the guy out front with a top hat on.  Whoa, come on in, gentlemen. 
[00:40:30]  Come on, sir.  Follow me, gentlemen.  But then they want to rip you off, and they don't give you anything.  And I don't go near the ladies.  You can wave at them across the room, but don't cross the police tape.  That's true.  But I tell you here...  Remove your hats, gentlemen.  Yeah.  Ten bucks a lap dance.  Ten bucks.  Really?  Fucking, yeah.  Ten bucks, man.  Yeah, not like fucking...  You're idiot.  I'm 40.  Is it the same fuck?  I have $120 of that dumb money, because I stood on the fucking currency exchange line,  and it takes hours in the airport to do.  I don't know what they do. 
[00:41:00]  Next time, go to the bank.  Crazy.  Take care of it at your bank.  No, I know, but I was like the next morning, and then...  I threw it away, because I've never seen anyone use Canadian money in America, so I just assume  it's useless.  The exchange rate is...  As soon as you get back in America.  It's not much with a couple of bucks, but boy, did they get me at that casino.  Really?  When I...  Well, I went to leave, and at the airport, I cashed in a few dollars from the casino.  And, yeah, you notice it at that point.  Man, you did well at the casino, huh?  Oh, boy. 
[00:41:30]  Did you?  Did I ever.  Yes, I did.  Yeah, I went to...  I sat down at a table, and never got to the point where I had to dig in for more money,  because the chips were gone.  What's that?  I had to dig in, because I had some double downs that I had to do, but then never lost  the money back.  Was there for a while, just kind of holding steady, and a little higher, a little much,  and then just went, whoop!  Really?  Had a few really good hands in a row.  Yeah, I was at a table with a couple of Saudi guys, and we had a great table, good time, 
[00:42:00]  we were laughing, and beheading some dealers.  Were they cool?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you guys were talking and stuff?  Yeah, I was having a great time, and yeah, I wound up doing very well.  Yes, and I have a fuckload of Canadian money I have to get rid of.  I gotta go exchange some, take some to the bank.  How very well. 
[00:42:30]  Spread it around a little.  Spread it around.  People want the number.  What would you say to that question?  About, I guess...  Oh, you're gonna say the number?  You usually don't say the number.  Oh, that's under...  Is it a new car?  Yeah.  Whoa.  I mean, I could buy a car.  Like a Rich Voss special?  Yeah, what kind of car is that easy?  Exactly.  That could be $1,500 if you're talking Voss language.  It's brand new to me.  I could buy a pretty good brand new car. 
[00:43:00]  Whoa.  Yeah.  Look at Jimmy's face.  Fuck, man.  That's a lot of money.  Yeah.  That's a lot of cake.  Under that.  It's very close to that.  People were counting the chips.  What's that?  Was it around this?  Just under that.  Oh.  Wait.  How many did you see your hands?  How many did you...  No, because I think you kind of tweeted what you did.  At one point, I had $40.  You did.  So you go to Anthony's feed, you'll find it.  You did tweet exactly how much.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  I had $47.  You're up $47.  Geez.  At one point.  No, Trev.  I was up $47 at one point, and then I dropped $10 and decided, I'm leaving.  That's smart.  I am fucking leaving.  We live in such different worlds.  Like, if I was up $50, I would be so happy.  Wow.  I'd say I could pay a credit card bill.  Aw.  Aw.  It's adorable.  It's just, it's so...  How about if you were up $47,000?  I would say, oh my goodness, I've just doubled my salary.  Wow. 
[00:44:00]  Damn.  Now I can pay rent for a couple of years.  A couple of years.  Yeah, it really is odd when you look at it.  Yeah, but you don't, I don't think Ant talks about the times he takes the hits.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying that, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I definitely talk about the times I shoot.  Because it could work the other way where it's like, fuck, he's in the hole for something  large.  The first night out, I started with $2,000.  I built it up to $12,000 and lost it all.  So it was like, you know, I was, meh. 
[00:44:30]  And then I left because we had the show to do the next day.  Right.  Thank God I left.  Let me say hi to Mike in Baltimore.  Boldymore.  Mikey.  Hey, what's up?  Welcome aboard, Mike.  Oh.  Oh, what's up?  Love the show.  What's up?  I was just going back to the baseball topic you were talking about earlier.  I don't know if you guys have heard of Chris Davis.  Uh-uh.  Charles.  We've all heard of Chris Davis.  Is he an Oriole?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah, number one in the league right now. 
[00:45:00]  Home run.  Yes.  How many does he have?  37.  He hasn't hit one since the All-Star break.  Oh, really?  Oh, he hasn't?  But he's been hitting a lot, right?  Yeah, he hit a lot before he went to the home run derby.  Yeah, 37.  All right, cool.  He's just going crazy.  Every game I would watch, it was a grand plan.  It was crazy.  Yeah, now, you know, like, you hit 37 home runs and everybody just automatically assumes  you're doing steroids, which really sucks for these guys.  Like, what if Chris Davis is completely clean, you know?  Like, now everybody thinks that if you ever hit, you know, more than 30 home runs before 
[00:45:30]  the All-Star break, well, you've got to be doing something.  Oh, as soon as he hit 30, everybody was going crazy, writing stories about how he was going  to aim for 60 by the end of the season.  Yeah, because now everybody talks about, you know, oh, well, what's the real record?  Is he going to break Roger Maris' record?  And then will he be the clean home run champion?  Look, man, we all loved when McGuire fucking did what he did with Sammy Sosa.  No, there was no complaints.  Even if you're against steroids, you can't deny that that wasn't a ton of fun when you 
[00:46:00]  were watching it.  It was amazing.  That's what I'm getting at.  So I don't care that, you know, fucking McGuire's bones are probably fucking rotting  away right now as we speak.  I don't care.  He gave us a good time.  I'm all for steroids, too.  I think, in my opinion, Chris Davis is clean, but...  I think you'd have to be a real idiot to do anything in this day.  Right.  You know.  And age.  And I was going to say that.  It doesn't sound right.  It's just day. 
[00:46:30]  All right, Mikey.  Thank you.  Let's go to Rob in North Carolina.  Rob.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, I'm in the Marines, and I think that everybody in all sports and the military should  be giving steroids for free, because in the sports, I watch it because I want to see some  fucked up shit happen.  And to that sports player, because as I left for work, and as I turned on your guys' show,  because I listen to you guys every fucking day. 
[00:47:00]  Every time I get a fucking chance, even when I was in Afghanistan, I would listen to you guys.  Wow, that's just stupid.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  And I watch sports.  Yeah.  So I could see some shit happen.  And if they're taking Royce for our amusement, good on them.  Right.  Yeah.  And when that senator, a couple years back, was crying about it, that his favorite pastime  has been ruined.  Who said that?  Fuck you.  You guys ruined America with your politics. 
[00:47:30]  Who?  Wait, who said America's pastime was ruined?  It was some senator.  Oh, okay.  Some fucking dickhead that was crying to McGuire and Sosa about the shit like four years ago,  five years ago.  Oh, when they did the in front of Congress thing.  Cuff McGuire.  Well, I played baseball for a while.  What happened to him?  Right.  Where's the big guy?  And these guys are getting paid millions of dollars.  If they're taking steroids under a doctor's supervision, I'm sure they'll be fine. 
[00:48:00]  They're not some person that goes to the gym that's taking steroids on their own without  a doctor's supervision and just going by what an online forum says what to take.  Right.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to pick where, like, you know, like, but you do feel for the other  guys, too, like, eh, they don't want to take, like, I don't know.  But steroids has proven that it is...  Oh, sorry, you're panicking.  Yeah.  Relax.  Wow.  It's easy.  You hear them?  We're not solving the issue, sir.  We're just chatting.  If you don't want to take them, then fucking boo-hoo.  Go fuck yourself. 
[00:48:30]  Well, no, because...  I'm just saying, I don't give a...  It's still not good for you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just saying I don't give a fuck.  Like, obviously, it's not going to be my way.  Yeah, if you don't want to take them, you shouldn't...  We should let off the guys in the back that are taking them.  I don't know.  Right.  Well, I mean, if you don't want to take them, like, say you don't feel it's good for you,  and maybe you...  It's kind of hard to go right now compete with guys who are under the same...  Yeah.  Financially, it's a huge advantage.  That guy who said that before was right.  It's a huge financial advantage.  I understand in the end.  Trust me.  But, I mean, baseball tickets are pretty expensive.  So, when you go to a game, you want to see some shit go down. 
[00:49:00]  It's like where I live in North Carolina.  I'm in Jacksonville.  I'm stationed at Camp Leone.  Right.  I've been in the Marine Corps for almost nine years.  Oh, Rob.  And, Jimmy, I saw you in October 2010 in Raleigh.  That's a whole life story, man.  Thank you.  All right.  It's amazing.  I'm surprised that Marine is being aggressive.  See you, man.  All right, Rob.  Thank you.  Kill her.  Yeah.  If I want to take him, let me take him.  All right.  Good point.  So, you're texting...  Take a hill.  So, you're texting the other girl that lost the dating game, technically. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Even though it was a close call.  Yeah, just chatting.  And she was very nice, too.  And you just couldn't...  Oh, because you were getting ready for the gala.  Yeah, and I didn't...  We probably could have hung out, but then I'm like...  I've really gotten weird with, like, pursuing possible sexual...  Like, I guess I'm just getting older, and I'm, like, not as crazy about it.  Like, I'm still in the dirt bag, but it basically has to be an open mouth tumbling into my lap.  I just can't fucking chase it that much anymore.  You don't want to put the work in. 
[00:50:00]  Nah, I'd rather jerk off.  I mean, even...  And that's something I'm back to doing a lot of, so that addiction is kind of kicking...  Like, I was doing good for a while, but now it's like I'm jerking off a lot, and it's  fucking my sleep.  Whatever, man.  I just...  I'm kind of annoyed at myself, but I'm happy I did those sets, because the night before  the gala, I had shit sets the whole time.  Montreal's not a great comedy city for me at all.  I do okay there at best.  I never destroy up there.  And the night before the gala, I finally found the set that I wanted to do at the Comedy  Works, and then, you know, it worked. 
[00:50:30]  But it's, like, weird, like the Paula Deen bit I do, where in the bit, I'll tell you what  I say, in the bit, is up there, racial stuff is so much different, because they don't have  the exact same history we do up there, here.  Right.  And the bit about, the point of the joke is that I think I hate phony white people acting  offended, because people use celebrities to make ourselves feel better.  So white people just can't walk up to their black friends and go, hi, I never say nigger.  But if Paula Deen says it, then you can go, oh, look how terrible.  That's the point of the joke.  But I say the word nigger, and it's for that reason. 
[00:51:00]  Because it's...  But I did that in Canada.  Silence.  Really?  And it does well at the Comedy Cellar, and everywhere else in New York, because people understand  the context of it.  And I'm not gratuitously throwing it out there, but up there, just that word...  But then I'm like, maybe they just don't have the same history, so the backlash...  Maybe the white people up there aren't feeling this politically correct backlash, and they  don't care about it.  Like, I was talking to somebody from the festival about that, and she goes, yeah, like, you 
[00:51:30]  know, racism is just so abhorrent.  And I was like, I get annoyed that she said that.  And I'm like, well, she's right.  Like, it's amazing how jaded I am to political correctness, because somebody says racism  is abhorrent, and I want to argue with them.  Like, abhorrent is.  Like, sometimes it's hard.  I've got to make sure I'm pushing back against political correctness, but not to the point  of siding with something that I genuinely don't agree with, like racism.  I don't want to make the wrong statements, either.  It's nice to be out of the race mix for a few days up there. 
[00:52:00]  It was chill.  It was so chill up there.  No bullshit.  You're talking about the mixing of races?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  It was just nice to, you know...  Right.  I didn't feel compelled to tweet every second because of it.  Yeah.  Very cool.  All right.  We'll break here.  Oh, yes.  Dinner.  Just getting started.  I'm sure we'll have more Montreal stuff.  Yeah.  Certainly.  We've got an insane clown posse coming in.  9 o'clock, yes. 
[00:52:30]  Are we ready for them?  Are you down with the clown?  I'm down with the clown.  Do we have a prep sheet for them?  Sam's making one up right now because Sal decided to take a personal day.  What?  I don't know.  I got an email.  We were gone for a week.  4.30 in the morning taking a personal day.  What is he doing?  Didn't send a prep sheet.  He had it easy last week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why didn't he send a prep sheet?  I don't know.  Unless somebody in his family is dead.  He's just making a statement.  Well, he was here yesterday.  He's making a...  He died yesterday.  Wait.  He was here yesterday?  Maybe.  I don't know.  Actually, maybe he took the day off.  He's making a statement because we're going to bring him to Montreal. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe he's saying, fuck you guys.  I did a lot of work.  Yeah.  Kinda.  Yeah, well.  Look at that Zito guy.  Yeah.  Who?  Ugh, Zito.  Never again.  I have to defend Mark Zito on principle because he helps me get pictures.  He's been a trooper.  Did he?  Yeah.  Boy, you didn't like him?  What happened?  I don't know.  I just don't like him.  He works for Greenstein.  We don't need Greenstein people around.  I don't even know why he was there. 
[00:53:30]  Do you think he was reporting back?  I don't know.  Might have been.  Why was he there?  Promotions.  What promotions?  Checked audience members in.  Who cares?  I'm sure the signs were up.  Oh, boy.  We've got people that could do that.  Say signage, Travis.  Why was Zito there, Sam?  No reason.  Right?  Thank you.  He was there.  Because this place, like, refuses to pay anyone, and then they do something stupid like that.  Yeah.  I would have rather take that and dump money.  It was probably a couple thousand dollars a cent.  I'm going to give one of you guys a quick raise. 
[00:54:00]  Why was he there?  He was there because nobody from promotions wanted to go, so they made Zito go.  I mean, he didn't even need to hang up the posters.  He was supposed to just go and hang up posters.  No.  Why did nobody want to go from promotions?  He gets to go to Montreal for three days to hang up posters.  That's the truth, right?  And he didn't even have to do it.  Roland posted photos on his Facebook of Zito sleeping.  I saw those.  While the show was on.  Right.  But the company has no money.  No, they're doing...  No, they got money.  Oh, yeah, they do.  I mean, have you seen stock? 
[00:54:30]  Stock is to the roof.  375.  This company's doing very well.  375.  And over 25 million subscribers.  We're doing just fine.  Damn.  Well, then why aren't they paying anybody?  Because they like having the money.  Yeah.  I'll be honest.  Scott drives me nuts sometimes.  I have a love-hate thing with him because I also own stock.  So part of me likes the fact that there's a fucking lunatic X-Man running everything  and fucking chopping everybody's heads off and keeping things flowing because the stock  is going up.  So I'm like...  But it's going to all collapse eventually because they're not... 
[00:55:00]  Oh, whatever.  It's a theory I got, which I know I'm right about, but fuck it.  It's going to bore the shit out of people.  You got to pump money into the actual company, though, to keep it going.  Or the whole thing will collapse.  Oh, yeah, it will.  For sure.  Tim Sabian's gone or not?  What do we know?  Because now I'm hearing Jeremy's going to run Howard's Channel.  Did you hear that?  So that means Jeremy is going to take on more responsibility.  So they're getting rid of another job around here.  Eventually, that's going to really just fucking collapse the whole thing. 
[00:55:30]  Unless he's taking that job and being replaced.  I don't know.  Unless his old job is getting replaced.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  They just give people more responsibility around here.  That is generally what happens, yeah.  And as we go to break in Anthony's eating, which you should be, I just want to point at something.  My penis.  It's still here.  This is still here. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I told you.  We're pointing at Eric.  It's still here.  Before we left for Montreal, Steve Blatter came in here and I go, Steve, just get rid of the clutter.  He goes, it'll happen today.  How long have we been talking about this clutter?  Can we get rid of it or do they have to do something?  They have to get rid of it.  They do.  And they said they would get rid of your screens at least.  Those screens.  Yeah, yeah.  What is going on?  It looks like a, I got to say, Anthony's section there with that fucking screen's going up and down.  It looks like a fucking construction area in the middle of the street. 
[00:56:30]  For the people that don't know, we have a shitty small studio, but we're like, at least cut the console and clean up the place.  You know, it'll give it a better appearance.  Right?  Yep.  And one of the things we said to the guys we talked to, how long ago was the talk with the engineers?  Seriously.  That had to be...  A month and a half ago?  Yeah, I would say a month and a half.  A month and a half ago.  They're like, we're going to get right on this.  We're going to fucking redesign.  We're going to push your...  It's all this stuff that needs to be done without fucking totally boring the audience. 
[00:57:00]  And Dan has these two giant screens in front of him.  He doesn't even use anymore.  So we're like, look, get rid of the giant screens.  That'll free up a little space.  There's just a bunch of keyboards in the middle of all of us that are just sitting there that none of us have ever touched in our lives.  There's a huge old school fucking phone that's just sitting there.  If we need the phone, that's fine.  But you can put it somewhere else.  Take it away.  It doesn't need to be there.  Right.  So I'm like, look, I know how this place runs.  And to redesign the whole studio, it's going to take a while.  We're not stupid. 
[00:57:30]  We've been around long enough to understand how things work.  I go, but at the very least, could you just clean up some of this shit?  That'll really help a lot.  You've got it.  They said, no problem, right away.  That was a month and a half ago.  Right.  And then a couple weeks later, I'm like, I go to the guys, Gary, or they're all the same fucking faces to me.  I'm like, look, you know, the clutter's still in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to get to it.  And then Steve Blatter comes in right before he left for Montreal.  I go, Steve.  He goes, you know what?  You guys are absolutely right.  There's, you know, there's no excuse for this.  This stuff should have been removed. 
[00:58:00]  I will make sure it's removed immediately today.  That was like four or five days ago.  We come back and it's still here.  I guess that didn't happen.  And then they wonder why we beat him up.  Look.  Oh.  I don't know how you guys can be anything but excited today.  I'm seeing Clown Posse.  It's ICP Day.  I am very happy.  But what are they going to do?  They're going to fucking be down.  Like, what do you mean, what are they going to do?  Are they going to perform?  What are they going to do?  No, they're not going to perform.  They're going to sit here and be among the greatest guests you've ever had in the studio. 
[00:58:30]  Because they're fucking awesome.  GQ.  Nice GQ.  GQ ranked them number one on their worst rappers of all time.  Gentleman's Quarterly.  You know what Shaggy Too Dope responded with?  You know what his quote was?  What?  Tell GQ to say it to my face.  Nice.  That's a great response.  He's going to beat up a magazine.  It's just sweet.  Can they get the clutter out of here?  Shaggy Too Dope could take care of this shit.  Yes.  Are you going to get a photo?  Fuck yeah. 
[00:59:00]  I should have brought mine in to get signed.  Just in case we get murdered at the Juggalos fucking gathering.  Yeah, you will.  Yeah, I think so.  Very cool.  I'm worried about that one.  I'm going to the gathering.  Oh yeah?  Yep.  Do you have the plane stuff?  Troy and me are going.  We were booking tickets probably today.  Wow, when is the whole thing going down?  August.  I'll tell you.  August 9th is when I'm performing on the 11 o'clock show.  Which is good because it's a Friday and by 11 no one's been drinking yet.  Nah.  Wow.  Juggalogathering.com.  I'm looking forward to it and dreading it. 
[00:59:30]  Like a part of me knows it's going to be a lot of fun because they're going to be maniacs.  But, you know, they've seen comedy before.  I think you're going to do incredibly well.  You never know.  I mean, and my relationship with those guys is good so that doesn't hurt.  You'll do great.  Juggalos are family.  Okay.  You'll do great.  All right.  So they're coming in what?  9 o'clock today?  9 a.m.  Yeah.  I've never met those guys.  No, neither have I.  My first time meeting them was doing their show and they were fucking...  I was like, oh, what the fuck are these guys going to be like?  And they were great.  Cool.  Awesome, right?  Yeah, they were really silly and nice and fun. 
[01:00:00]  They were doing something right.  They've been around a long fucking time.  20 years, I think?  Wow.  20 years.  Yeah.  Wow.  They know how to make fucking money, too, man.  Those guys make a shitload of money.  And they do it themselves.  Yeah.  All independent now.  Oh, really?  They do it, right?  Completely.  Don't they have their own label?  Their own record label.  Their own everything.  Psychopathic records.  You don't rely on the industry to do it and fucking...  No, you got to do it all yourself.  The industry won't have them.  But you know what I'm saying?  Like, they didn't just fucking wither away and die.  They went and...  Dude, they've been around since 89. 
[01:00:30]  What's this?  It's a mouse to know her.  It's a mouse to know her.  It's 24 years.  It's up there on the little monitor speaker for something.  You know what they named their independent wrestling organization?  What?  Juggalo Champion Shit Wrestling.  Champion Shit Wrestling.  Do they have any names in that league?  Cactus Sack sometimes wrestles for them.  They sound like Cactus Jack.  Oh, they love wrestlers, right?  They love wrestling.  What do you mean?  Do they get any old school wrestlers that are a little down on their luck? 
[01:01:00]  They need a game.  Tons of them.  They got Greg the Hammer Valentine on their show.  Oh, that's what I'm asking.  I told you.  I didn't know who he was.  And they really get Mick Foley to be Cactus Sack.  Oh.  Like, it's not just some guy dressed as Mick Foley.  It's the actual Mick Foley, and he's Cactus Sack.  No kidding.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Wait, why do all their wrestlers look like WWE guys?  Like who?  Yeah, it looks like Triple H right here.  That looks like Triple H.  Yeah, look.  That guy looks sort of like The Undertaker.  Cactus Sack was the star of their film Big Money Hustlers. 
[01:01:30]  Not to be confused with Big Money Rustlers, their western that they put out.  Was it good?  It was awesome.  They were still in the face paint, but they were dressed like cowboys.  And they were talking like ICP dogs.  What the fuck is that?  Is there a clip?  Straight to video, yeah.  But I want a clip.  Can we find a clip that we can play right now?  Can we just find a clip of Big Money Rustlers?  Sure.  Wow.  I need a clip of this.  That's insane.  No, Rustlers.  Rustlers.  Oh, here we go.  Sorry.  Big Money Rustlers full movie. 
[01:02:00]  All right, let's watch that until I get here.  All right.  Big Money Rustlers.  Boom.  We can't do it.  Sure we can.  We'll be done before they get in.  Full moon.  You can't see Travis.  They put this out.  Hmm?  Yeah.  They put this out independently.  Mud bug population 183.  It's inside of a bar, yeah.  And instead of Jack Daniels, it's Faygo.  Faygo is their shit.  Guy's picking his nose.  Playing a little poker. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, a guy playing poker.  They're obsessed with Faygo, which is a store brand of soda in the Midwest.  Like Michigan, especially.  And that's theirs.  No, they don't own Faygo.  Oh, they don't.  They just love Faygo.  Going around.  And all the juggalos love Faygo.  I've never had it.  Going around the table.  Are you going to drink Faygo when you go to the gathering?  Fuck yeah, I'm going to drink Faygo.  Do they have their own flavor or anything?  I don't think so.  Oh.  But they spray Faygo at their audience.  It's awesome.  Why?  Why is he in?  Look at Violet J.  Why is he in?  It's his turn to bet.  He's wearing a fucking clown makeup and a hat. 
[01:03:00]  It's his turn to bet.  Oh, that's pretty.  That's real pretty.  He's a cowboy, but also a clown.  Four naked ladies and a one-eyed jack.  You got my money, motherfuckers.  Don't give respect, big baby.  What the hell was that?  You're playing five-card draw.  You got nine cards.  That's some outright plain old cheat. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, he shot him.  Holy shit, he just killed him.  Anybody else got any issues you need discussing?  I didn't fucking think so.  Now let us continue this fine game of chance.  See?  Oh, hell no, big baby.  Don't you know that, man, we had to rob the Mudbug 410  just to get all this money together?  Hell yeah?  We lost three men on that job.  We damn sure as hell ain't just gonna roll over  and let you cheat it all the way from him?  Are you fucking crazy? 
[01:04:00]  That's some mighty big top from Dead Man.  Dude from behind shot him with a shotgun.  Who's that?  I don't know.  Woo-hoo!  They're changing the population to 179.  And that's Scott Hall.  Man, I'm gonna go by each one of their homes.  Razor Ramon.  To their wives.  Who wants to Razor Ramon?  Okay, I don't even look familiar.  He looks a little fat these days.  It's Razor Ramon. 
[01:04:30]  I've never seen him so sober.  When did this come out?  That came out probably like three years ago,  three or four years ago.  That's great.  They just put their friends in their movies.  Did they really?  Yeah, they just put out like, you know.  That was kind of a cool little scene.  It was fucking awesome.  I'll say the shootings were very good.  See, and that's like, I think that's twisted with them.  130 or an hour and 32 minutes.  And I do like that they didn't, you know,  go with that normal period kind of speaking.  No.  He kept it gangsta and hip-hop like. 
[01:05:00]  Look what I got, motherfuckers!  Even though they're in the, like, Old West.  Yeah, they're in the Old West.  Like, it's the 1800s for sure.  And no one's questioning why he's wearing clown makeup.  He's Violent J.  But the other, I guess that's Shaggy Trudeau  with the fucking gun.  I don't know, he's got a bandana covering his face.  Holding a shotgun.  Could be.  Nice.  That's something.  We're in a 9 a.m. today.  Shit.  Yeah, that should be fun.  When does our show come out?  Do we have that?  I'm going to watch this when I get home. 
[01:05:30]  Big Money Restless?  I just, it's such a ridiculous concept.  It's so awesome.  That they thought of it, and then they executed it,  and they accomplished it.  You know what?  I'll say that fucking, they just,  they have a guy in charge of all their production stuff,  or no?  It's probably them.  I mean, they probably hire good people,  but they're the brains behind this whole thing.  Like, we're going to make a movie.  We're going to make a movie.  They got top billing.  Of course they got top billing.  All right, we got a break. 
[01:06:00]  Very good, Sam.  The Monoxide Child is in that movie, Sam.  Jason Mewes.  Scott Hall.  Yeah, the show is already on.  Oh, Blasey Dead Homie's in it?  Well, of course Blasey Dead Homie's in it.  Ron Jeremy.  The show's already on Fuse,  but it's on Wednesdays at 11.  Okay.  What's the show?  It's like,  it's obviously a little inspired by Beavis and Butthead.  They're watching music videos,  because Fuse started putting out,  like, just as viral videos,  is the ICP watching, like, Carly Rae Jepsen 
[01:06:30]  and Gangnam Style and those videos,  and they did huge numbers on YouTube.  Oh.  And so they gave ICP a show based on that concept,  and then that's what Jim did, too.  Now I want to see them doing a video.  Two blurred lines.  And that's what the show is.  You watch the video,  but then they interview you and bullshit you,  and they were saying some things,  and I wanted to go,  you know Fuse will never air this.  They don't give a fuck, right?  No, they don't care,  and it was funny to hear them say certain things,  and they're going to be very shocked  in the editing room. 
[01:07:00]  Like, what do you mean I can't say faggot?  I like this dumb song, by the way,  by Robin Thicke.  It's a giant song.  It's the biggest song there is.  Yeah, this ended up being the song of the summer.  I don't know it.  I guess so.  Yeah, you know it if you heard it, I think.  It's been number one.  This thing's huge.  You want to play this?  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to see what they say about the song.  Sugar Slam!  Pour some sugar on me, babe!  Their projectionist is a woman named Sugar Slam.  Our next video is from Robin Thicke,  called Blurred Lines.  Hot.  Yeah.  There's a lot of pussy in this video. 
[01:07:30]  I never heard this.  What?  Yeah, I was watching this video.  Yeah, f***ing Robin Thicke.  I'm not familiar with Thicke's body of work.  I'm not familiar with his face  because his dad  was on growing pains.  That's that mother f***er.  Just like Alan Thicke.  Alan Thicke.  Wow.  Alan Thicke put his f*** to use  and gave us Robin Thicke.  Is that what he's dead?  Look at his face!  Look at his face!  Clearly his dad.  Robin Thicke. 
[01:08:00]  Look at Greg the Hammer Valentine.  Go back, go back real quick.  They call him Slick Robin Thicke.  Greg the Hammer Valentine.  Sorry, go back just a little bit.  That's the guy I was telling you about right there.  Yeah, it's Vampiro.  Oh, Vampiro.  They call him Slick Robin Thicke.  The man with the big d***  who attracts a lot of chicks.  Slick Robin Thicke.  See, that's not good.  He's promoting smoking to the children of America.  But what Robin Thicke needs to see  is that commercial of that lady  where she takes her face off.  This is how I like my dad. 
[01:08:30]  You keep smoking, don't look like me.  T.I. does not have a thick d***.  He can brag about the size of it  because it's long.  It goes all the way down to his knee.  But it's real thin.  Why are we talking about doing this?  Pharrell, on the other hand,  I happen to know,  is a hermaphrodite  because he's pretty in the face.  If you put it way down,  he'd be a attractive chick.  Look at how slick Robin Thicke looks  with that hair, man.  How can we be one of those guys?  One of those GQ men? 
[01:09:00]  You're going to have to lose half your body  to get in that GQ club.  Why do you have to diss me all of a sudden?  What the f*** did I say?  Your lucky hammer  don't put you out of commission.  Look at the hammer.  What the f***?  How can you not watch that show?  It's genius.  That is a good one.  Good for them.  Jesus.  Yeah.  They got a brand.  They've successfully gone  from being a joke  to being cool.  Of course, people hate on the ICP,  but look how much they've accomplished.  Getting all the guys in.  Just Shaggy, Two Dope, and Violent J. 
[01:09:30]  Those are them.  And then they show what they're...  Like, everybody else...  There are lots of other artists  on psychopathic records.  Right.  But they're not the ICP.  Of course not.  How many people do they get on stage, though?  Oh, no.  I mean, they'll get a ton of people on stage.  When it hit Woodstock 99,  I think I talked about this on the after show,  they came out and they were performing,  and then just as part of their stage show,  they had two naked men  in clown masks doing jumping jacks.  And you're just sitting there 
[01:10:00]  watching it on pay-per-view like,  why'd they get two dudes naked?  What the fuck?  But it was fucking hilarious.  Woodstock 99?  Yeah.  It's a little number you called  Fuck the World.  I remember that.  Fuck the world.  I don't make it.  I said they will.  See, and they're spraying Faygo.  Fuck the world!  How do they take off like this?  This is a big sword for them.  No, but I mean,  as in St. Clown Posse,  how did it get to this point?  Because it got like, uh, 
[01:10:30]  very edgy.  Why are the curtains closing?  I don't know.  Who said the closest curtains?  Well, you said naked men jumping around, so.  Who knew the curtains were?  No one wants to watch St. Clown Posse.  That's not true.  This is just fuck everyone.  They put out an album  called The Great Malenko,  and Disney owned the record label  to put it out,  and it was pulled from shelves  like hours after its release. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  And Disney dropped them immediately,  and it made them famous,  because then all the kids were like,  I gotta hear this band  that nobody wants us to hear.  Fuckin' you.  If you guys want to see that record,  Eric brought it for them to get signed.  That's a good idea.  I'm much for the charity auction.  Yeah.  And then right after that,  MTV aired their shockumentary,  and it made them, like,  big,  because kids were like,  I gotta hear this, you know,  rebellious group,  and then it was just a couple clowns  rapping about chopping people up 
[01:11:30]  with hatchets.  It was fucking awesome.  Crowd fucking loves them.  That's 99?  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  There's one thing with clown makeup,  you never age.  They look exactly the same.  Well, that, yeah,  they learned that from Kiss, I guess,  you know?  You put that makeup on,  and all of a sudden you're the same guy.  He's just kicking bottles of Faygo  into the crowd.  He just said,  fuck Dionne Warwick.  Oh, that's crazy.  That's fucking awesome.  He just said,  fuck both sides of the Berlin Wall. 
[01:12:00]  It's insanity.  There's a lot of fucking people  watching them there  with Stuck 99.  Damn.  That was a huge concert.  They had big beef with Eminem  for a long time.  Faggot ass.  They had a big thing apparently with,  remember TRL?  Yeah.  Some requests live.  I think it might have been,  it was a video around this time,  around 99,  that they put out.  And they had all their fans, 
[01:12:30]  like,  amassed and said,  today,  or, you know,  on this day,  vote for this video  and let's get it on TRL.  And so they had all their fans show up.  There were like 400 Juggalos  outside TRL  and they all called up  and voted for the song.  But apparently,  the story is that the police  removed the Juggalos  before the show got on the air  and told them  that you can't be here.  No.  Oh, NYPD.  Oh.  And then MTV  wouldn't acknowledge any votes  that the ICP got that done. 
[01:13:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Instead of just Juggalos,  oh yeah, okay.  Yeah.  The mainstream has always been  trying to shut down ICP.  I like the fact they did stuff themselves.  I respect that.  Yeah.  You know, it's like...  I always thought there were  more than two guys.  I just realized there's only two guys.  No, it's just...  For some reason,  I really thought there were more.  I'm an idiot.  You didn't do a lot of research  for this one.  No, man.  The waves were great yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That made you a nice prep sheet.  Just give that a read  during the commercial.  I'm not going to even read it.  All right.  You just think about the waves? 
[01:13:30]  Yep.  All right.  I'm going to buy a sailboat.  I'm going to buy.  You're going to buy a sailboat?  Yep.  Are you really?  That's pretty sick.  Whoa.  Sailboat.  Can you wait until we're done already?  Like a Kennedy.  That's a disaster way to happen.  Just sit in a fucking pond with it.  Can you not go get lost at sea?  I'm just going to start sailing around  being Ken Stevens.  Oh, nice.  Right?  Yeah.  You know what my favorite ICP lyrics is?  What?  What?  They did a song  and they said,  what is a juggalo?  He's not a phony. 
[01:14:00]  He'll come in your house  and bust a nut in your macaroni.  Nice.  All right.  I'm just like,  these are the realest dudes of all time.  What?  Yeah, but who wants someone  to come in their macaroni?  Exactly.  Yeah.  But a juggalo will do that shit.  I guess all this stuff was fine  pre-9-11, you know?  Yeah.  Eh, a little goofy.  What, busting a nut in your macaroni?  I just see this is December 2000.  April 20?  Oh.  All right.  There's a lot of those fuckers outside.  It's the juggalos.  I told you they're family. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, there were a lot of them.  That's Sean William Scott.  Jesus.  Our old friend.  Wow.  What happened to him?  What happened to Stifler?  I'm sure he'll pop up in a movie or something.  He'll be back in here.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, when he does a movie.  I love him.  Yep.  ICP sold more product than Kiss.  All right, we're going to learn about  Insane Clown Posse after the break.  Get ready for this interview.  Oh, yeah.  Proper style.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Serious XM. 
[01:15:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  What is a juggalo?  Let me think for a second.  Well.  Oh.  He gets butt naked.  And then he walks through the streets winking at freaks.  With a two liter stuck in his butt cheeks.  What is a juggalo?  He just don't care.  He might try to pull the wheels in his neck head.  Cause he can give a fuck less what a bitch thinks.  He tellin' that a butt stinks. 
[01:15:30]  And all that.  What is a juggalo?  He drinks like a fish.  And then he starts huggin' people like a drunk bitch.  Next thing he's pickin' fights with his best friends.  Then he starts with the huggin' again.  Fuck.  What is a juggalo?  A fuckin' limitic.  Somebody with a rope tied to his dick.  Then he jumps out a ten-story window.  What is a juggalo?  Yeah, huh?  Got insane clown posse comin' in at nine o'clock today. 
[01:16:00]  Two liter shoved in his butt cheeks.  I heard that sound.  Yeah.  I love the shit.  He's a lyricist.  Wrong at that.  Think they're gettin' to the macaroni part soon.  How do you not respect it?  They got this vision.  And they're just goin' for it, you know?  How about that?  Like you.  How about that?  If you have a vision, you're goin' for it. 
[01:16:30]  You just go.  Right, right.  Fuck the haters.  Fuck yeah.  Well, speaking of haters, it's very rare you get a hater on Twitter.  But it happens from time to time.  And, uh, this guy writes,  Great listening to three non-baseball fans talk about how steroids should be legal.  Hashtag douchey.  Ew.  What are you, Mr. Baseball guy?  Yeah, what are you, a real hardcore ball fan? 
[01:17:00]  It's the guy that just talks to his friends all day only about baseball.  Go fuck yourself.  It's just a radio show, bruh.  Yeah, we're just giving our opinion on it.  And, sorry, you're the hardcore fan and we're not.  What, are you a purist?  Yeah.  Oh.  Remember they said interleague play would be bad?  Right.  Well, I'm not a match and the Yankees should never meet.  Now it's great.  Oh, my God.  We shouldn't be.  What I don't understand is, obviously, the tone was us just being goofy about it.  This guy's a idiot.  Of course you can't have steroids legal in baseball, you idiot. 
[01:17:30]  That was our point.  I'm gonna look for him later and just block him.  Yeah, I'm looking for him right now.  You know what?  I wouldn't even mind if they were legal to be very,  because I don't care if those guys are willing to do it.  I get the argument from both sides.  And he also writes, stop, you're not a baseball fan.  I've admitted that, you idiot.  And what do you think?  I'm not a baseball fan.  I haven't been a baseball fan in years.  And it was the listeners calling me out on it.  And one day I went home and went, wow, I think they're right.  I'm not a baseball fan anymore.  Somewhere along the line I just gave up on the sport and didn't realize it. 
[01:18:00]  You're not entitled to an opinion about baseball?  But it's not even an opinion.  That's why I laugh at these idiots, because it was more of a bit than anything.  But I don't care if they're taking shit.  I know.  But obviously it's not gonna be something that should be legal.  If you don't know all the stats and everything, you're not a fan.  This guy is one of the, I've seen these people, you know, at little fucking get-togethers and whatnot.  They're boring. 
[01:18:30]  They talk about one fucking thing.  Sports.  But not even understanding that we were more goofing than anything during the whole steroid conversation.  That's what, it boggles my mind.  That people are that stupid that listen to our show.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  That's the only one today.  It's very rare.  I mean, Twitter has been pretty fucking pure lately.  Not many haters out there whatsoever.  He's an idiot.  It's terrific as far as social networking goes.  It's wonderful.  It's a wonderful tool. 
[01:19:00]  Yes.  It really is.  Oh my god, I finally saw the Breaking Bad season premiere that's coming up in like, what, three weeks?  Wow, you got it.  You finally saw something that the rest of us want to see for three weeks.  I finally saw, well, I had the DVD for a while.  Oh, who farted?  Not me.  I swear.  I don't smell any.  Kenny, did you bring that in?  No.  That's convincing.  No.  Sorry.  Someone fucking let something leak out. 
[01:19:30]  I'm usually...  Is it a rare fart from Anthony Comia?  No.  A rare one?  No.  And by a rare one, you mean one that doesn't smell like cum.  That's rare.  I smell a fart.  I'm the only one, though, huh?  I think Kenny brought something in.  You smell that, right?  What?  Yeah, it just hit me.  What is that?  Wasn't you Jimmy?  I think it was Jimmy.  I think Kenny fucking farted.  What, that's not his thing to admit farts?  How would Anthony...  It smells like vegetation. 
[01:20:00]  Kenny.  Oh.  Well, you're certainly not Kenny.  Was it you?  Did you drop a gasser?  If Sidney dropped a gasser, it would smell like little flower petals.  Kenny, you drag one in and it's your thing not to announce it?  I said no.  I said no.  No?  I don't care.  I admit farting.  I love to fart.  I love to shit.  I love to curse.  What else do you love?  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  That's about it.  That's where the list ends.  Yeah.  You love to shit, fart, and curse.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That's a great match.com profile if you're ever single.  I want to shit, fart, and curse.  Yeah.  I don't like long walks in the park.  What is the...  So Breaking Bad.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got the first episode of the new season that comes out in a few weeks.  A couple weeks.  Oh, fucking...  That show is the best.  Oh, my God.  It really is.  Who are we having on? 
[01:21:00]  Hank?  Is Hank coming in?  Yeah, I believe so.  Yeah.  That's going to be cool.  I think Thursday, maybe.  Right?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah?  Good.  Very cool.  Good.  Yeah, I was watching that, and of course, people...  I have to tweet a picture of the actual screen on my TV and go, ha ha.  People can't wait.  I love getting those fucking episodes early.  How'd you get that one early?  Jesus.  Roland.  Wow.  Good for Roland.  Roland fucking handed it right over.  He said something during the break. 
[01:21:30]  Me and Ant looked at each other and went, wow.  Wow.  He said something.  I had no idea what he said.  I thought he picked up French from Montreal.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I don't know what language he was speaking.  I heard...  I swear I heard him say something, something, Marie Osmond something.  And then he repeated it, and it had nothing to do with Marie Osmond.  I think he said we could go see the new Steve Jobs movie.  Oh, Jobs probably sounds.  Is that with...  Steve Jobs.  Steve Jobs.  Ashton Kutcher.  Ashton Kutcher, yeah.  Hmm.  Ah.  Are we going to have Ashton Kutcher in?  I don't see that on the... 
[01:22:00]  Then I'm not seeing the Steve Jobs fucking movie.  Oh, wow.  Good.  Somebody said Kenny's farts smell like shoe polish in phone books.  Things used to hit people.  Yeah.  Who are we going to get from that movie again?  I don't think anybody.  What?  Although, isn't...  Doesn't Josh Gad play Steve Wozniak?  Oh, yeah.  We are getting Josh, aren't we?  Are we getting Josh?  Maybe.  Maybe we'll get Josh.  I would see the Steve Jobs movie because of Josh. 
[01:22:30]  I like him.  He looks like Woz in that movie.  He's the dude from Book of Mormon, and then he went on to do the show for...  What was it?  NBC, the White House show, whatever.  Is this still on?  He talked about that when he was in here.  Yeah, I saw one episode.  It wasn't that bad.  Yeah, I am.  It was all right.  It's canceled.  Yeah.  Iraq, how was your time in Montreal?  It was great.  Yeah.  And then came home and got sick.  Oh, what's wrong, sweetie?  Oh.  I have a sore throat, fever, and congested. 
[01:23:00]  And decided to come in here.  That's cool.  Well, sorry.  I decided to do the work.  Well, you're going to get all the gals sick.  I don't need a sick Jackie or a sick Sydney.  No.  Mill in a bowed coffin.  Tell Jackie to get some spinach.  Oh, that was so funny.  They don't have your spinach.  What?  Spinach.  Spinach.  The no spinach zone.  He looks like Jason Alexander.  Young Jason Alexander with a fucking hairpiece, doesn't he? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're looking at Josh Gad from the Steve Jobs movie.  Steve Walsniak.  Yep.  So Breaking Bad, obviously, thumbs up.  I mean, it's tough to talk about because you can't really give away shit.  You can't give away shit.  I like the old days when we would just give away shit.  Yeah, yeah.  We realized that really was starting to hurt our fucking show.  People don't appreciate spoilers.  All the Breaking Bad seasons start with some weird thing going on. 
[01:24:00]  You're like, what is this?  I have no idea what they're doing, what they're getting at.  The camera and direction looks really odd.  And then, like, it pulls back.  You finally realize what's going on.  You're like, oh, fuck.  And then it gets really good.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  And this doesn't disappoint.  Very cool.  That's for sure.  I watched that.  I watched that new fucking movie with Oblivion.  Tom Cruise. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, about the Earth or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That didn't do well.  I guess not.  Right?  I guess not.  If it's on demand just now.  Already?  Yeah, it was like early release on demand.  What did you think of it?  I mean, it was kind of cool.  Like, I didn't turn it off.  That's a compliment.  But Morgan Freeman is in it also.  Playing Morgan Freeman.  Did you see fucking the Frank Caliendo Morgan Freeman Vine? 
[01:25:00]  No.  Is it good?  Yeah.  Find that one.  Let me clear my throat here.  Find Frank Caliendo.  I remember he was working on the Morgan Freeman, like, last time he was in here, and it was  kind of hard to get.  He fucking got it.  He nails it now.  He fucking got it.  Morgan Freeman.  Here it is.  It's Morgan Freeman, and he's narrating himself during breakfast. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  He narrates opening the refrigerator.  Yeah, it was really good.  Good for Frank.  That's spot on.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Morgan Freeman was in it, and Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise.  Effects-wise, pretty cool, you know.  The story was a little, there was a little Matrix-y.  It was a little 2001 A Space Odyssey, a little Planet of the Apes-y.  There was like a lot of shit going on in this movie.  I didn't mind it.  I kind of liked it.  But it seems like there's too many of the same movies coming out.  Like, there's that one, and then you get confused with the Will Smith one with his son,  and then there's the other one with, who do you have it, or with Charlie Day. 
[01:26:30]  It's hard to tell thematically, it's hard to tell all these big budget things about different  platforms.  You're right.  It's like, that's why they're fucking all bombing, because nobody can differentiate between  any of them.  When Independence Day came out, that was the movie about the White House being attacked  and the aliens, so you knew what it was.  Now they had that one with Morgan Freeman as president.  Why wouldn't they?  And then Jamie Foxx, and it's the same fucking thing.  You're a fan of Jamie Foxx, though, Anthony. 
[01:27:00]  I couldn't be more of a fan of the wonderful Jamie Foxx.  Oh, really?  I didn't think you liked him.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan.  Troy Kwan, in studio.  How was Montreal, Troy?  Dude, I had a blast.  Troy's great.  Troy's fun to hang out with.  It was really fun hanging out with all you guys, too, man.  We really appreciate you taking us out to dinner.  We had a good time.  Just hanging with us, man.  You're welcome.  It was a blast.  Ant did it.  That was a lot of fun, man.  We fucking hung out.  Ate, drank, went to the titty bar. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  That was cool.  That was the titty bar.  It was okay.  I mean, we only had like an hour, because the comedy show went a little later.  You know, it was like, I was a little bummed out, honestly, though, by about Montreal's  sex industry.  Oh, you wanted to find the red light district.  You were convinced there was this whole red light district.  I forgot about that.  Well, everybody's like, oh, Montreal's insane.  It's like Amsterdam, you know?  And you think you're going to go walk down and see windows with brothels with girls in it.  It couldn't have been further from the truth. 
[01:28:00]  You know what I mean?  And then even like the strip club was fun, and it is cool to be able to touch the girls,  but they have them so the guys that work there can come in and look in while you're  getting a lap dance.  Over, yeah.  So it's kind of like, oh, you're really...  Because I've been to some clubs where it's like a room, and there's just some shady shit  going on.  I'm sure some of them are like that, though.  Maybe this is the only one we went into.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We didn't really dig too hard.  We just kind of went to the one that was down the street, but it was still fun.  There was a real tall black girl that was Oliver Anthony.  That was everyone laughing. 
[01:28:30]  And I was like, hey, back's a bitch.  I was like, Anthony, I'll jump on this grenade for you, and I took her in the back.  She took his hat off and was flirting with him.  Really?  It was so funny.  I threw her a 10 to grab Roland.  To go away.  Oh, no, I went.  I took her in the back.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I was just like, nah, take it easy.  That's not his thing.  Hey, I'm not going to fucking...  That's great.  I'm not going to be PC and waste the fucking, you know, time and effort.  And she was sitting there flirting with him, and Ann eventually got tired of being coy  and just started going, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. 
[01:29:00]  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  She wasn't that hot.  If she was really hot, it would have been different.  She wasn't that hot.  She was just all right.  She wasn't that hot at all.  How was the dance?  It was good.  She was hotter.  It was hotter than the other girl that I had there.  But they opened up your shirt, and they're like, sucking on my nipples.  I'm like, all right, cool.  So I kept like, throwing money, like, okay, where are we going to go with this?  And it was like, then it was like, oh, that's it.  And I'm like, all right.  I was sucking one girl's nipples, too.  Jesus.  Wow.  Jesus.  Yeah, I was kind of doing the same thing.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  So you had fun.  There was a brothel across the street.  Did you wind up going to it?  No, I didn't.  Oh, you heard about that.  Right, right, right.  An actual brothel?  Yeah.  Yeah, who was telling me about that?  I just, I went up and like, just rang the buzzer, and I looked in, and I was like.  Because I heard some fat girl came to the door, and.  I was like, yeah, no, this is not happening.  A fat girl came to the door?  I mean, it was just like, I mean, I don't know why you would represent.  How bad, like, Anthony Wiener's broad that was in the paper yesterday?  Bigger than her.  Okay. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, I mean, I'd fuck her.  I wouldn't fuck this girl.  You'd fuck the Anthony Wiener broad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Dude, big girls.  They don't always have to be hot.  Big girls give more.  I understand all that.  Big girls give more.  You gotta remember that.  That one's rough, man.  She was, she's fucking, she's got a body like a pear.  You don't gotta love the bitch.  You don't gotta marry her.  I understand they don't all have to be, you know, smoking hot, but she's rough.  Oh, look at her right there.  Oh, she's rough.  Get the fuck out of here.  I bet you she's a lot of fun.  That's fuckable, though. 
[01:30:30]  That's fuckable.  Yeah.  I agree, Jim.  She's a big disaster, but she'd probably fuck you good.  No, start from the beginning, Sam.  Is that the first picture?  There's about 20 of them.  She's like, um.  This was in the post yesterday.  Yeah, she's Frederica Bimmel body.  Oh, God.  Dude, that's not that bad, though.  That's definitely fuckable.  She's doing something.  No, she's sucking in her gut.  Yeah, I like that.  That picture, she said, look at that.  That's a horrendous hiney, man.  It is, but you hold those hips, and that big fucking fat ass is against your stomach like  that.  Oh, she'd make you cum so good.  And she'd be so grateful.  Look at the huge bathing suit bottom she has on. 
[01:31:00]  Because they know she's horrendous.  She's covering up the gunt.  Yeah, she's a...  Oh, my God.  Look at the gunt sticking out.  Taylor Swift, another one with a giant bathing suit bottom.  Those stupid bathing suits.  They're going to come back, right?  I think she's hiding...  I think Taylor Swift is hiding a giant line of pubes that goes from way down to our belly  button.  She just got covered up.  Dude, that's rough, Troy.  Come on.  I mean, I've been worse.  I've had worse, so...  Yeah, but you wouldn't go out of your way, is what I'm saying. 
[01:31:30]  No, no.  If it was presented to you like, oh, what the fuck?  But that's...  If it fell in my lap, no, I'd have no problem with it.  That's the one who ratted on Anthony Weiner.  She's a fucking fat rat.  Yeah.  You fat snitch.  A rat.  What a fat tattletale.  What's up with the tattoo on the back?  She likes to have fun.  You can tell.  Look at that.  Leaning all the way back to kind of, like, hide some hurt.  What is this photo shoot about?  Like, she's just...  I'm one of these bras that's like, all right, I'll get famous from, you know, sex with Anthony  Weiner. 
[01:32:00]  Is that what this is?  But where's it going to lead to?  Nothing.  Look at that horrendous tattoo on her back.  The bottoms are hilariously big.  That looks like an hourglass tattooed on her arm.  Dude, that's a rough ass.  Maybe she's a big Days of Our Lives fan.  That's the S of it.  Oh, she's splashing.  Splash.  Just having a little fun.  Yeah, it's fun.  Just having a little frolic in the water.  They should show her laying there on the beach, like, washed up.  And when they had her frolic like that, because they realized the water would hide a lot of shit. 
[01:32:30]  But...  There's water between her and her face.  Who did it?  The Daily News Post.  The Post did this exclusively.  It was theirs.  Their photo shoot.  Yeah.  Oh, believe me then.  They don't want to cover anything.  They love the fact that she's a bit of a mess.  And got out there.  An oinker.  It was funny to hear Troy in taxi cabs with French men driving these cabs trying to say,  Where is, uh, lay prostitute?  Oh, you did?  Troy.  Yeah.  And what do they say? 
[01:33:00]  Some of them just didn't even know what I was talking about.  And I took out my money and I would say money.  And I'd show, like, tits.  Tits.  And then I would give the, like, fucking sign.  The universal sign for fucking.  And they were in the hole.  I'd put up my arms like, Where do I go?  I had to just...  It wasn't happening.  They couldn't figure it out.  And then we were fucking with all the, uh, the waitresses and just having fun with them.  Because nobody understands American slang.  No.  So you just start saying some crazy shit.  Yeah, it was like...  He kept flirting with this girl in Dairy Queen.  Oh. 
[01:33:30]  And he'd be, like...  He'd be looking at her and going, I like those shoes.  And she'd go, I don't know.  I told her her shoe game was tight.  I'd say, your shoe game is tight, you know?  And she goes, I...  No, I don't know.  And he goes, your shoe game is tight.  To her, those are just alien words.  Right.  Rolling talking to her.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  You like Mark Zito?  No.  No.  He rubbed me the wrong way this trip.  Why?  He rubbed you?  Well, yeah.  As a guy walking around the hallway, he's fine. 
[01:34:00]  But just seeing his work ethic, seeing him there, like, it was just a...  The company just wasted their money sending him there.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  What was his job there?  We're all trying to figure it out.  To really just to hang posters?  Well, he said that, and then he said, well, my job is done.  He's like, he didn't even have to do his job.  No.  So, I know that Sam had needed something for Colin Quinn, I think.  Well, yeah, there were a couple of times.  He wouldn't step up and do just dumb shit.  No.  He wouldn't clean up your oatmeal.  Yeah, but that's going to sound like I'm a diva or something.  But...  No, but it wasn't just that. 
[01:34:30]  Well, sometimes if...  I'll say this.  But I was...  I ran into back to get, you know, take a leak, and he just refused to clean it up.  Right.  I'm going to clean it up myself, is what I'm saying, but I was elsewhere.  If there's an on-air spill, anyone from the staff should come over and, like, just try  to help clean...  It's not being a bitch to come over and clean up an on-air spill.  Or come over with stuff where I could clean it up.  I didn't even have anything I could clean it up with.  He said...  Did you ask him to do that, or...  He said no.  His quote was, I'm not doing that.  But then he wouldn't even go get something for you.  Right. 
[01:35:00]  And then, like, I think Colin or somebody...  Who cares who doesn't?  ...needed equal...  I'll do myself.  I don't give a fuck.  Oh.  He's like, I need you to go up and get equal for him.  And he was just so slow-moving about it.  Like, he would do it, but he wanted to make sure that he was doing it on his time.  So he wouldn't do it now.  He would do it in 30 seconds.  Good luck to you.  And then Roland needed something as well, and he was just sitting there sleeping.  He wouldn't get up out of it.  And every time I'd go out to the bathroom when the show was on, he's, like, sprawled out  on the couch sleeping.  Oh, shit.  And it's like, really?  Like, this is what the company's paying this jerk off to do? 
[01:35:30]  Damn!  And that's just...  I mean, that's just the beginning of it.  You didn't like him socially?  Well, no, because every time we went out, when we went out the first night, we were  like, okay, let's go out to dinner with him, whatever, we'll give him the benefit of the  doubt.  And just every time you say something, like, if it's something private between me and Sam,  he'd always try to butt his nose into it.  And you could just tell he's, like, he's looking for information to tell the bosses.  Like, you could just tell he's just slimy like that.  Oh, shit, really?  And if I think you're a fucking snake like that, you're done. 
[01:36:00]  I'm not fucking with you at all.  Yeah, I don't like that.  No.  So he just rubbed me the wrong way.  And he just wore the same goddamn clothes the entire time.  He had his hat hanging off his head, and I just couldn't understand why he was doing  that.  And then somebody said, that's because John Mayer does that.  And that just was like, you gotta fucking be kidding me.  Oh, no.  Really?  What do you mean, the hat hanging off his head?  Well, he's, like, weirdly obsessed with John Mayer.  I like John Mayer's new song, though.  Yeah, I mean, John Mayer has fine songs, but to be obsessed with him. 
[01:36:30]  No, I'm obsessed with John Mayer.  To the point where you hang your hat off your head like he does?  Yeah, the John Mayer hoodie on the whole time.  Literally every day we were in Montreal, we were in the same John Mayer hoodie.  Wait, does it say John Mayer on it?  Yes.  Really?  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  So what is the hat hanging?  I don't know what that is.  You know, it's like he kind of wears his hat on, like, the back of his head.  So, like, the front head.  Well, he has to.  Mayer has a giant head.  Yeah, he doesn't have a hat that fits.  That's all that's about.  It's a look now.  John Mayer's a rock star.  Mark Zito's just a fucking asshole.  You feel me on that one? 
[01:37:00]  I already said it.  I don't really know the guy, so.  But your instinct is.  I don't like him.  Right.  There's something about him.  He seems entitled to something.  There's so many fucking people in this world that are just entitled without even doing anything yet.  Right.  And then when you do do something and make something of yourself, you still shouldn't be entitled.  He's just slimy.  He's a slimy dude.  He's just the guy you can't be trusted.  I don't think, in my opinion.  You don't trust him?  No.  Fuck no. 
[01:37:30]  Especially anything.  He's always searching for something to take back to the bosses.  Really?  Yeah.  That's just my vibe.  Know what that gets you in prison?  What's that?  The old shank.  Yep.  Right out there in the yard.  Yeah.  The shank.  Someone like that.  So it was just my goal to completely get rid of him as quickly as possible at any time we were hanging out with him.  He's all right.  He's not going to do the bus trip, right?  God, I hope not.  Maybe we'll need somebody for a promotion.  No, we'll make sure that doesn't happen.  Because that's our next trip, I believe. 
[01:38:00]  It's going down in a couple months.  Oh, yeah.  Month and a half.  16th, I think it starts.  September 16th.  September.  What day is that?  Monday?  Yeah.  That's going to be fun.  Yeah.  Well, and that's not the next show trip.  I mean, that's the next full show trip.  The next trip that show members are going on.  Oh, boy.  It's to Cave and Rock, Illinois in about a week and a half.  That is true.  That's a week and a half.  It's the 20th of August, right?  No, no, no.  It's the 9th.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you're going.  I thought I had more time.  You're going soon. 
[01:38:30]  It's a week from Friday.  A week from Friday.  A week from Friday you guys are going?  A blee.  You guys should come with us.  You want to go to the gathering?  No.  Why?  I got some waves to catch.  Maybe after you meet ICP today.  I'll change your mind.  There.  Got some waves.  You know, hey, I'm sure the ICP guys are great.  And they'll come in.  We'll have fun and stuff.  But the last thing I'd want to do is, you know, except for Jimmy, perhaps, but it seems  like those people, I probably wouldn't want to hang out with them. 
[01:39:00]  Come on.  Why would you want to hang out with them?  I bet you'd find a couple of juggalettes you'd want to nail.  They're probably right up.  Oh, I'm sure.  Juggalettes.  Probably right up your alley.  I bet they're...  Show me a juggalette or two.  All right.  Find some juggalettes.  Yeah, you find me a hot one.  I was looking at pictures of naked juggalettes yesterday.  They do exist.  I have seen them.  By the way, we finally have a situation that we've wished for for a long time.  Anthony Weiner will not drop out of this race.  No, this is great.  We're going to watch this play out.  This is great.  That's his arrogance.  At this point, politicians drop out.  And he's like, well, his quote today is, I want to let New Yorkers decide. 
[01:39:30]  Dude, look at these messes.  Holy...  Oh, my God.  Come on, Ant.  Right?  Right?  Huh?  Those...  Yeah, they're not particularly good looking.  Are so gruesome.  That's so...  The one girl on the end looks like me.  On the far right.  Yes.  She looks like me.  Look at this, though.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  See?  Wait, do they hang out like this during the festival at the gathering?  Yeah.  They just all walk around naked?  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  It's Wednesday through Sunday.  I mean, they're not going to be in clothes all the time. 
[01:40:00]  They show off their neddins.  Yeah.  What's that?  That's what ICP calls vaginas.  Neddins.  Neddins.  Why?  I'm not quite sure.  So much better than like...  See, but even that made-up slang is so much better than like Kavino and Rich's made-up slang.  Oh, yeah.  Way better.  You know?  They got a couple good ones.  What do they call vaginas?  What was it?  Not Nussie, is it?  I think it's...  That's like a girl, like a Nussie.  There's a hussy, though.  But what's a vagina?  Where's Kenny?  He knows all about those guys. 
[01:40:30]  I love when he talks about Kavino and Rich.  More pics.  Covino and Rich?  Covino, right.  Yeah, Kenny knows that.  Oh, Jesus.  What's going on there?  And I got news for you.  Those girls like to have a good time.  Oh, yeah?  Kenny, do you know what Kavino and Rich calls the pussy?  No, but their big thing now is they have deep thoughts.  Like, they'll think of a question, they'll post it on Facebook for all their fans to answer.  Like Harvey Allen?  Yeah.  What's a deep thought?  Yeah, give us an example of one of their recent deep thoughts. 
[01:41:00]  Could you go to their Facebook page and...  Well, we're looking at the juggalettes.  We're kind of looking at naked juggalettes.  Yeah, I don't want to go from naked girls to fucking Kavino and Rich's Facebook page.  Those aren't real girls.  They're criminals.  Oh, E-Rock just reminded me of my ear.  What?  Pusetta.  Get some pusetta?  Oh, pusetta like my mother used to make.  Melt like it's a nice and thin.  Yeah.  Do you like that, Troy?  No.  Troy. 
[01:41:30]  This sucks.  Troy.  Never disappoints.  You don't have a filter, do you?  How do these chicks get into this?  What?  They're down with a clown.  Why are they down with the clown?  Because it's fucking awesome.  That girl has great tits right there.  She's going to be some pretty girls.  That is a wonderful ass on that girl right there.  Those two are all right, yes.  You're going to tell me those girls don't look like fun?  Of course they look like fun.  They're like a fucking riot.  That's it.  That's why you've got to be at the gathering.  They've got clown paint on.  Of course they look like fun.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  You ain't going to see any of that walking around.  You probably will.  I mean, I know a porn girl, and she said she goes to the entire thing and she's naked the whole time.  Oh my God.  That's what you'll see.  Holy fuck.  Wow, that's rough.  That is a little rough.  All right.  It's okay.  All right.  All right.  What's wrong with that?  All right.  Okay.  Well, I don't think that's okay.  Okay.  Well, sure.  What happened there?  All right.  I see what's going on there. 
[01:42:30]  You can tell.  Mm-hmm.  It's even through the clown makeup.  Oh, all right.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Yeah, sure.  Jesus.  You're going to take pictures, guys?  Send us pictures.  Lots of pictures.  Video.  You're checking our Instagrams.  We'll make sure we keep everybody updated.  Oh, yeah.  You're not going to have an internet connection.  No?  They don't have Wi-Fi there, you don't think?  No, they'll figure it out.  In the middle of the fucking woods?  I think they...  Kenny said no.  Kenny has to use my satellite phone because he's got no cell service.  I think they'll have cell service. 
[01:43:00]  They've got to figure that out now.  Maybe there.  Maybe they can just take photos and upload it the next day.  Sure.  Yeah.  So Anthony Wiener will not drop out of the race, and even Elliot.  Elliot Spitzer's taking a little shot at Anthony Wiener.  Saying he's too much of a perv.  They're all a little more.  Oh, Wiener, too pervy for mayor.  They all have their moral barometers, and they always think that they are a little more  moral and a little, yeah, better than everyone else.  Because apparently, yeah, Spitzer said that Wiener should drop out of the race. 
[01:43:30]  He wouldn't make a good mayor.  He's too fucking pervy.  And then Bill Clinton, Bill and Hillary are mad because Wiener is comparing him and his  wife's problems that he's had running for mayor with Bill and Hillary and what they went  through when Bill Clinton splooged on a fat intern in the Oval fucking office.  Right.  And then they're like, you know, hey, hey, hey, well, I wasn't texting anybody.  Right.  You know.  And they're friends, I guess. 
[01:44:00]  Are they?  Yeah, because Hillary, well, Wiener's wife worked with Hillary.  Oh, right, right, right.  I don't know what kind of relationship they have now, but she did work for Hillary for  a while.  It's just so ridiculous, because they're all a bunch of fucking phonies.  Bill Clinton's going to talk like he's fucking, hey, I don't like that they're saying that  you fucking got a blowjob in the Oval Office.  Yeah.  What else did he get done to?  Lawsuits and fucking all this other stuff he's had with Paula.  Who was his name?  Paula Jones. 
[01:44:30]  Paula Jones.  He got her flowers.  It's like, dude, you were a pig, and that's fine.  Yeah, fine.  Don't even worry about it.  And those are the ones that came forward.  There's probably a few other hidden gems in there.  But don't start going, hey, I wouldn't do that.  Sure.  I love that Wiener's not stepping down.  I think it's hilarious.  Stay in this to the end.  He's going to get his ass handed to him.  Could you imagine he fucking wins?  We're going to look like assholes.  Perseverance.  New York City, we're going to look like complete assholes if he wins. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  Good for him.  He's all over the news.  I don't even know who the other candidates are.  You got the Quinn board.  Christine Quinn.  Fuck.  She's very liberal.  Dummy.  And then who else he got?  I don't even know.  Yeah.  I don't even give a fuck.  No one cares about this race at this point.  So we're going to have a weird shitty mayor then, right? 
[01:45:30]  I don't think.  We're going to wish Bloomberg stayed in there.  And that's kind of strange to say.  Have any Republicans thrown their hat in the ring?  I don't know.  I know this is all like Democratic bullshit.  I don't know.  Why do we not know?  I don't know.  I don't even get to vote for you.  Oh, de Blasio and Thompson.  De Blasio.  Yeah.  You get this broad.  ...turity and responsibility.  And you see that in me through all the work that I've done. 
[01:46:00]  When New Yorkers look at my record over the past eight years as Speaker, eight budgets  balanced on time.  When there was a threat of 4,100 teachers being laid off, I didn't just have press conferences  say this can't happen.  And I stopped it by bringing the teachers union and the Department of Education into  a room and staying in that room until we got concessions.  Do you think when big name New Yorkers like the former governor, Elliott Spitzer, when  he jumps in and he says his piece that he's not going to vote for Anthony Winter, does 
[01:46:30]  that help or hurt what's going on?  You know, I think that whatever Elliott Spitzer says is not so relevant to the mayor's race,  you know, at all.  I think the mayor's race, the voices that matter, are the New Yorkers who are going to vote.  And trust me, every day out there, they're asking me what I can do to make their lives  better.  No, they're not.  And then because they're New Yorkers, they say, yeah, yeah, that's a promise.  Tell me what you did.  Just like everyone else.  And when I told them the record of having delivered.  She's a liar.  They're all liars.  She's lying right there.  Stop.  Come on.  They're all a bunch of fucking liars. 
[01:47:00]  She has a smart hairdo.  Oh, she's very sensible.  Oh, and when I go out there, people are asking me, what could I know?  They're going, how about that Wiener guy?  Just like on this interview.  She's up there on the screen and what's under her?  Wiener slips in polls.  Get it?  Jesus.  Is that a pun?  Yeah.  The news loves a good pun.  Oh, do they ever?  They're punny.  They're punny.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, John Montone on 1010 Wins can't stop with the Wiener puns. 
[01:47:30]  Really?  Oh, my God.  Support for Wiener softening.  Oh, we get it.  Wiener going down.  Down.  In the polls.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just all about the pun.  We get it.  It's a big dick joke.  So this is New York City.  Everybody cares about New York City because we're the greatest city in the world.  Oh, God.  More blah, blah, blah.  This is amateur hour politics, Christine Quinn. 
[01:48:00]  Like, let me say what I think people want to hear.  Kidding.  It's so we matter because we're in New York.  Oh, God.  Every time we just pop it down, it's another hacky fucking line from a politician.  Yes.  And this is like politician 101.  It's not even clever.  Right.  Like, anyone can see through this shit.  Discussion about second chances in this race from former Congressman Wiener and the former governor. 
[01:48:30]  Look, for me, the question is, let's give us a first chance.  You know, if I'm elected mayor, when I'm elected mayor, I'll be the first woman and the first openly gay mayor of the city of New York.  Let's not have a conversation about second chances.  Let's have a conversation about the potential of first chances and history and what that could mean for the greatest city.  Was that Manchin?  See, right there, what she's doing, though?  As you said, openly gay.  Was that a shot at Mr. Kotz?  Yeah, I think so.  Where the rumors were.  He was, yeah.  No one knows for sure.  He never answered the question. 
[01:49:00]  He never answered the question, which is fine if he doesn't want to answer it, but he's now dead, of course.  She's saying, let's have the first openly gay thing.  It'd be a good thing.  Right.  Like, come on, like, she's saying, I want this to be something that you consider when you're voting for me because it will be positive.  Which is fine for her to say that.  But.  But, if the flip side, you said something like, well, I don't know if you should, all of a sudden you're a horrible fucking person.  Yeah, it's great for her to say, vote for me because I'm gay, which she just said that. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  You know, at least some of the people, hey, if, you know, just vote for me because I'm gay.  But how about don't vote for her because she's gay?  Well, now you're in trouble.  I just don't like her politics.  What did you make when you heard the comments that Pope Francis has made when he's about homosexuality that he says, who am I to be the judge?  I thought they were terrific.  I think the Pope deserves so much credit for making those statements.  Now she's going to turn around to her.  They were enormously positive statements.  She's going to turn around to her and the mayor.  From any significant religious leader.  But from the Pope himself to make a statement like that. 
[01:50:00]  It is enormous progress.  Now look, there's more we want.  Changes we want in the Catholic Church.  Let me be clear.  It's not everything.  She has nice cheekbones.  She's a...  I do not like her politics at all.  This Pope is wild.  I like this guy a lot, man.  He's eating baby brains right there.  He doesn't even give a fuck about security or nothing.  He was driving in that car with the window down and they got stuck in traffic. 
[01:50:30]  Like that would have never happened with the past Popes.  Carries his own luggage.  Carries his own.  That's the one that you can tell really has the faith.  Yeah.  Because he's like, well, if I get shot or get killed, fucking, I know where I'm going.  Right, exactly.  Better place.  I just get there faster.  That's such an amazing place to be.  The other Popes are just like, fuck, I'm not buying this story.  Right.  Keep me alive.  Bulletproof glass.  You got a great point.  Because if you have tremendous faith and it's such an amazing place to be eventually, 
[01:51:00]  why would you say, oh, fuck, God's will.  Target hat.  Target hat.  Right.  But the other Popes are like, I've seen the nightmares that go on in this church.  There is no God.  Right.  Bulletproof glass.  Put up the window.  I'm just the latest guy that has to push this shit forward.  Yes.  We all know it.  This guy actually has faith.  But I get a guy that washes my feet every night, so it's not that bad.  Yeah.  It's a good gig.  Right.  That last guy was a hunk of shit.  Pope Benedict was a hunk of shit. 
[01:51:30]  Pope Benedict.  He was a ghoul.  What a pomp and circumstance.  Cocksucker ghoul.  This guy's great.  He's fun to watch.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What is it?  He talked to three million people or something in Brazil?  Yeah.  Where was it in Brazil?  Yep.  Three million people showed up?  Three million people.  Yeah.  He's like the John Paul guy, you know?  He's like...  He's better than John Paul, I think.  Much better.  John Paul was good.  John Paul was good.  Especially for the time, too.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  I was right behind you on that one.  He was a conservative old douche, just like all these guys. 
[01:52:00]  It's kind of easy to look back.  But back then, you know...  Back then, he was ahead of his time, Jimmy.  He really was.  You wouldn't get any fucking Pope saying shit like what this guy said about, hey, gays,  I'm not going to judge him.  You should be like, that's for God to decide.  Exactly.  That's probably what he meant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, sending him to hell, that's not my job.  Right.  That's God's job.  Right.  And it will be done.  It's for him.  Oh, does God hate the homosexuals?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  According to them, right?  Oh, yeah.  You read that fucking Bible?  I don't know.  There's one or two lines in there that aren't really in there, I guess.  Oh, is that what...  I don't know.  It gets confusing.  The Bible says Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  And then you realize there's nothing in there about anybody.  You sure?  Because now we're going to get the phone call.  It says that I think a couple of times, there's a few references to it, the Bible had a man  leg with another man.  There's a few, but it's not...  There's so many more things they talk about more.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That nobody even pays attention.  God cared if you stuck your dick in a guy's ass. 
[01:53:00]  Doesn't God get busy?  Well, we did the bit recently.  You're also...  The Bible says you're not supposed to eat shrimp.  Shellfish or whatever the fuck.  Remember that?  And you're not supposed to cut your hair and all this stuff that we're all doing.  Yeah.  You can't pick and choose.  You can't pick and choose.  Shrek.  What was that bit?  Eh, whatever.  We'll play on that worst stuff someday.  Well, we're getting excited.  We're a little over a half hour away from Insane Clown Posse.  What?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:53:30]  Coming in the studio and fucking shit up.  Yeah.  Hope they brought some Faygo.  Do ya?  Yeah, fuck ya.  What does it taste like?  Like store brand soda.  But it's very famous in like the Midwest, especially in Detroit.  Never heard of it.  They became very famous.  Like Strawberry Faygo.  It's been around forever there.  Broke-ass Detroit.  Broke-ass Detroit.  Who could afford...  Yeah, because they can't afford like Coke or Pepsi.  You know who used to drink Strawberry Faygo all the time, as evident in the HBO biopic? 
[01:54:00]  Kid Rock.  Dr. Jack Kevorkian.  Dr. Jack.  Jack Kevorkian.  Strawberry Faygo, the whole movie.  Give me a Faygo!  That's right.  Al Pacino's portrayal.  Pacino played him, yes.  It's great.  Man.  I was watching an HBO documentary on, um, was that fucking like a war photographer that  went to Juarez?  You see that one, Jimmy?  Juarez, Mexico.  The fucking war photographer.  I did.  Actually, his father was a war photographer.  Yes.  And he got killed.  Man.  You see that guy?  He's shot in the car and he's just like, hey. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, hanging out, yeah.  And they're just, the guy's like, it's not my job to help.  It's not my job to do anything but document what is happening and document it for history.  He was just standing by the passenger side.  This guy's shot in his car asking for help and I'm going to die and shit.  And he's just taking pictures.  I get why they do that and yet there's a real lack of humanity in it.  Yes.  You could say like, hey, I'm just here to document.  If I wasn't here, he wouldn't get help and it wouldn't be documented. 
[01:55:00]  How did he not help though?  Well, that's just it.  Would he have been in danger if he helped?  No.  Oh, that's weird.  No.  He just snapped photos.  Why couldn't you take a couple pics and then...  No.  Because him getting the shot and what he says is documenting it for history.  But the reality is...  But he can change history.  He can take one picture and be done and help him.  No, he wanted pictures of the fact that no one was helping him.  Right, I get it.  That in itself is the story.  I get it, but as a human, that's rough. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, as a human...  That's rough.  You know, he's taking the humanity out of the equation and just like, I'm just here to document this.  Let me ask you something.  So would he do the same thing if he was a kid?  I don't know.  From what he said...  He's a kid now in that same situation.  From what I say...  I would love to ask him that question.  He doesn't care.  But does he have a line where he would finally go, oh, fuck it.  I gotta help.  I would assume from watching this, probably not.  Well, let's just say his wife was being raped.  Let's say his wife or his sister was being raped.  Yeah, she went on one of these trips with him. 
[01:56:00]  And people were watching...  Of course he'd help.  No, no, he would.  But like, how would he feel about a photographer just watching his wife?  He'd probably say, well, I understand.  But would you?  Well, he was getting shit from some family members because he was taking pictures of a mother  who had just found out that her son was shot.  So then the guy came up and put his hand on the lens and said, hey, you know, give her...  a time to grieve.  He goes, what are you doing?  How would you like if this happened?  And then he started going into the story about his father.  He goes, I...  You know, that shit did happen with his own father who was killed in, I think, El Salvador. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  He was doing some photojournalism and he was shot.  It took today to realize I'm not an animal.  No, huh?  Fuck, how do you do that?  I don't know.  How the fuck do you do that and not help?  That's a rough one.  I probably wouldn't help if I knew my fucking life was in danger.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, but if it was a safe situation, how the fuck do you not help?  Or at least comfort the guy.  Like, how does your humanity...  I get taking the pictures, but how do you not just take a couple of pictures and then 
[01:57:00]  help?  Right.  Like, you have to just stand there and see the little shutter bug.  Oh, my God.  Because it's more important for history to see it than for you to do something as a human  being.  And it's not important for history to see it, you fucking douche.  I don't know.  If you want to get the great shots.  If you're documenting the horror of the drug lord and drug wars in Juarez, Mexico, and you  want to show that this happens all the time and people don't help these people. 
[01:57:30]  The army was literally standing there.  There's a picture of soldiers or policemen's feet and the barrel of his gun just kind of  down.  And there were a few of those around in the outside of the shot.  And then in the middle of the shot was the guy just kind of laying on the ground.  And you could tell he was still alive, but they weren't helping him.  That is what he wanted to show.  How do you show that by then helping the guy?  What?  I understand the humanity part.  Well, my answer would be simple. 
[01:58:00]  There's plenty of other shit that you would definitely not get involved with, which would  make your point.  But that's a different story.  If you couldn't get involved.  Then you pick and choose your fucking stories, because there's enough unbelievable shit going  on down there to document, is my point.  I guess he wanted that.  And what happened to the guy that, why was he shot?  The guy that was on the ground.  He didn't know.  Was he a bad guy?  Because maybe that makes it different.  That would make it different.  I think it's all in context.  Was he a bad guy?  A good guy? 
[01:58:30]  An innocent victim of the whole drug?  Didn't really hear about it.  I'd like to know that guy's story.  Yeah.  Maybe they didn't want to tell you the story of the guy, because then you would understand  why they didn't help him.  Maybe they decided to leave that out a little bit to really play with your emotions.  He's probably just somebody in the drug game.  Yeah.  He could have been a lower level guy.  Sure.  Right.  Because they were showing a fuckload of people just like fucking dead.  What's the name of this documentary series? 
[01:59:00]  I think it's...  I forget his name.  It's on HBO Go, right?  Yeah.  Juarez is in the name of the...  Of that one.  Yeah.  Juarez.  I don't know.  What is it?  Um...  Witness Juarez?  Witness Juarez.  I saw a couple of Witnesses.  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  I saw the one in, uh...  Um...  What was it?  Libya?  Hmm.  The one in Libya, I think? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  I was actually enjoying this, uh...  Documentary series, and then I tapped out a little while ago.  HBO puts together some really good shit.  Oh, great stuff.  Their documentaries are really fucking good.  They know what they're doing, right?  Oh, yeah.  Did you watch the Pussy Riot documentary?  Pussy Riot?  No.  I didn't see the Pussy Riot one.  It's pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't see that one.  I was...  I was watching another one.  It was like Eyewitness...  Eyewitness War, something like that.  What is it? 
[02:00:00]  And it's...  It was a bunch of guys with, like, fucking headcams on and shit in battle in Afghanistan and shit.  It was pretty intense.  And then they were talking with the guys, interviewing them, and you'd get a little insight on what was going on at the time,  and then they'd go back to the camera views and the battle.  Pretty fucking sick shit.  Sounds interesting.  Yeah.  First person game.  Nothing better than documentaries.  Period.  Good shit.  Let's go to Jay in Tampa. 
[02:00:30]  Hey, Opa, how's it going, brother?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Listen, did you guys ever see that documentary called The Devil's Breath?  What's that?  It's about the fucking stripper Jimmy was with the other...  The Devil's Breath?  Yeah, it smells like fire.  Oh.  What is it about there, Jay?  It's about a...  It's actually a flower that grows in Columbia, and it takes away all your free will whatsoever.  You don't even look like you're hot.  The vice did it.  Oh, right.  Oh, right.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  It takes away your free will?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  What's the flower called?  The politically correct?  I heard about this.  Did maybe Rogan or somebody was talking about this.  Is this shit real?  Yes, and can you get women to taste?  Yeah.  Can you put it in a woman's tea?  Yeah, you can look it up on topdocumentary.com.  Is that a short clip of it there, Sam?  No, it's a full documentary.  What is it supposed to do, Jay?  It takes away the free will, so then what happens?  So, in other words, they'll be like, you want to go to the ATM and get all your money 
[02:01:30]  out, and you go take all your money out, and you just fucking give it to people, man.  I mean, they show prostitutes and drug dealers using it.  You know, they're basically saying there's no use for this, like, to get high or anything  like that.  It's just strictly drug.  How long does it last?  Apparently, only about 24 hours, Jim.  Oh.  But what do you do?  Crush it up and drink it, or do they eat it?  There's several ways they were distributing it.  It was, it almost looks like cocaine when it's refined, but it literally grows on the 
[02:02:00]  street in these really nice-looking flowers.  It just pops in.  Never heard of this stuff.  Like, could I put it in a girl's liverwurst sandwich?  Like, say I had a girl over, and I made her some liverwurst, and perhaps a bit of pea soup.  Oh, God.  Can I sprinkle mind-control flour?  What an awful lunch.  What, with a couple of, uh, fuckin' Ritz crackers or some oysterettes?  Ugh.  Back in the day, we would do shrooms every once in a while, and it was always in a horrendous, 
[02:02:30]  you're bringing back a memory, it was always in a horrendous cheese sandwich, and it wasn't  even good cheese, it was just, like, fuckin' government cheese, basically.  Like, why can't we, like, fuckin' make this taste good, throwin' in a pasta or something?  It always, I just remember, it was like, alright, someone would pull out the cheese sandwich  that had some shrooms in it, and it was just, God, awful.  I forgot about that until just now.  I'm punching out your mind.  Alright, yeah, whatever. 
[02:03:00]  Thanks, Jay.  Hey, can we, um, Sam, play the first couple minutes, I guarantee they'll give you a shitload  of info on this thing, even though it's the full video.  Vice Rules presents Colombian Devil's Breath.  Ooh, lily pads.  Welcome to Bogota, Colombia.  We're here chasing after the most dangerous drug in the world, burundanga.  What?  Burundanga is the source of scopolamine, which is basically like the worst roofie you can 
[02:03:30]  ever imagine, times a million.  You're at the whim of suggestions like, hey, take me to your ATM.  Hey, come with me to the hotel room, while you're completely conscious and articulate.  What?  I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  It's a beautiful flower right there.  God, look at that airport.  JFK.  Oh.  I thought we spoke at the top.  There's a lot of different parts of the plant that are a bit dangerous, possibly a bit  fun, depending on what you're into. 
[02:04:00]  So we're going to be looking for the tree, talking to people who've had experience with  it, and seeing if we can find some of the actual drug ourselves.  Fucking devil.  It's not like a fast flight.  No kidding.  Yeah.  It just takes a lot of longer than you do.  Bogota, Colombia.  Would you go there, Jimmy?  Would you do a show in Bogota?  No.  No.  Before Mexico, though, yes.  Yeah?  Wow.  So the deal with Burundanga is that it pretty much eliminates your free will. 
[02:04:30]  So you're awake and you're articulate.  And to anyone else watching you, it seems like you're perfectly fine.  But you've completely lost control of your own actions.  So you're at the whim of suggestions, and that's how people take advantage of you.  This is like what Jeffrey Tomo was trying to do.  I've heard a bunch of different stories, really running the gamut.  Some of them sound like kind of campfire horror stories you're told when you're growing up.  Stuff like waking up in a bathtub with an organ cut out and a sign saying you have five hours 
[02:05:00]  to get to the hospital.  Titties.  We've, of course, also heard...  How do they know it was five hours?  What if you overslept?  We heard one particularly chilling story where a guy was taken back to his apartment, woke up the next morning in the empty apartment.  Tooth-prushing camera left?  Confused as to what happened, went down, said to his doorman, you know, why is my apartment empty?  What's my ass hurt?  The doorman said, well, you brought it out with two of your friends last night.  All your stuff, you loaded it into a van.  And the guy was like, why in the hell would you let me do that? 
[02:05:30]  That's a real story.  And he was like, because you told me to.  So that's kind of the stuff we're dealing with here.  Well, I want to talk to that guy.  The elimination of Free Will, while still acting.  Fucking Free Willy.  It's like the rail or something.  Fuck yeah, devil's breath.  Spelled by fucking brimstone.  It makes you play the shitty flute?  Oh.  Yeah.  It's a drug like no other, nothing can compare, got me? 
[02:06:00]  It makes you put tanks on the top of a building?  Yeah.  For example, with this, you can be walking right here and suddenly, you have your back turned  or a girl walking right here and I walk up and go, and he did a blowing motion, just like  that.  With just that flash, the person is totally drugged.  Stop.  Oh, no.  You know what?  That's like some kind of men in black shit.  Yeah, come on. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, that's, you wait a minute and when you see it kick in, then you know that you  own that person.  That's like some zombie stuff.  You can't guide, you can guide them wherever you want.  It's like they're a child.  Oh!  You say, take me to your house, give me a checkbook.  Take out your savings, give me your credit card numbers.  Ta-ta-ta.  Ta-ta.  Just like that.  If you exceed the dose, you run the risk of the person dying.  Oh.  Columbia is basically...  Why wouldn't the military use this? 
[02:07:00]  Right?  Right.  Exactly.  They would be dropping this by aircraft.  Of course.  Maybe they are.  Fly over the enemy with a crop duster of this shit in it.  Yeah.  And then you just go, put down your weapons.  And then you suggest, give us your plans.  Yes.  Sounds like a plot to a new Jim Norton movie.  That's what happens.  Give us your plans.  It's the military drops the fucking suggestion drug on everybody and says, tell us where  your leaders are.  Oh.  And take us there. 
[02:07:30]  Give us your plan books.  One gram could kill 10 to 15 people.  What?  I don't know.  I got to watch this whole thing.  Well, it depends on what gram is.  Oh.  Who gram is.  Why don't we take a break?  Get ready for an insane clown possum.  I got to think.  I'm going to have to check out this documentary.  You're going to have to check out some ICP shit first.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Should we say we'll be right back?  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. 
[02:08:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony.  No, no, no, no, no.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues.  While I'm headed down a southern trail, I'm going chicken hunting.  Chopping redneck chicken neck size and nothing to the hillbilly.  Stick my barrel in his eye.  Boom shaka boom shaka hair chumps in the sky.  Why?  I never like chicken pie pie.  Or the chopped chicken not right.  Tell Mr. Billy Bob I'ma cut his neck. 
[02:08:30]  Let's slice.  Poke.  Chop, chop, stab, cut.  What can you do with a truckin' hillbilly?  Cut his fucking eyes.  I'll feed him to his head.  Nilly, willy, willy chicken.  Chicken hunting, gotta love it.  Hit him with a 12-gauge bucket.  Chicken nuggets laid out all over the glass.  15 minutes, huh?  Insane Clown Posse Day.  They should be in about 10, 12 minutes.  Nice. 
[02:09:00]  We got a chicken story in the paper today.  Oh, nice.  Nice egg.  Nice egg, right?  Yeah.  A little KFC bucket on someone's front lawn.  Yeah, what was that about?  I saw it on the news.  Is that a racist thing?  And it made the news?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I think it's the white guy.  Oh.  I have no idea.  They're trying to, like, fucking make a big deal out of it.  It was an oversized KFC bucket, though.  Where do you get one of those?  You got the audio.  I know.  I want to see the video, though.  I think it's seven feet tall. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, where did you get it from?  It's probably one of those old ones that used to be on Kentucky Fried Chicken.  They had them kind of tilted on a big pole outside the place.  Yeah, but how did you get one of those off the roof?  Well, it probably was in, like, storage somewhere.  Oh, okay.  Like, I haven't seen one of those.  Look at this fucking...  Yeah, that looks like...  So why is this a story?  Because it's that giant...  Like, this woman came home.  It should be a viral video, but it doesn't need to be a story.  The woman didn't know why it was there, though.  Yeah.  It's her house, and all of a sudden, there's a big Colonel Sanders bucket.  Some goofy people left it. 
[02:10:00]  I got a fucking great one.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, Chip?  It looks like fucking King Kong went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and said,  give me a bucket of something.  Can you play the video?  I want to see what this is about.  If you saw this from the highway, and trust me, you can most definitely see this from the highway.  I guess we'll have to trust you.  You might be surprised to find out this isn't KFC.  This is someone's front yard.  What?  When I was driving by, I...  Pause.  ...by this giant Kentucky Fried Chicken.  It's barely a front yard, first of all. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  It's a real shitty house.  Jeez.  What are they...  I mean...  It's in the middle of nowhere.  It's in the middle of nowhere, too.  You're right.  It's not like suburbia.  It's like on a dirt road that turns into grass.  Right, it looks like the next house is a mile away.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you talking about?  This isn't a problem.  This is barely a story.  Right.  It's a dirt road over there that just ends.  You see that?  Where does that dirt road go?  This goes into the guy's lawn.  The old dirt road.  Up the old dirt road.  Chicken bucket in my yard. 
[02:11:00]  And I thought for sure that I was hallucinating, so I called my teenager to work home.  She's eating a lot of fucking fried chicken, by the way.  Yeah.  And I know what you're thinking.  The answer is no.  She probably got excited thinking it was filled with delicious chicken.  Kendrick tells me it appeared Thursday afternoon, and she had no idea where it came from or who it belongs to.  Maybe it's a sign.  We've heard of heavenly manna, but what about original recipe?  Too often we need something to laugh about.  Oh, yeah.  And so I put it on Facebook and told them that I would bring chicken to the next potluck. 
[02:11:30]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  You're a hoot with your Facebook friends.  He is.  Woo-hoo!  Oh.  Yuck.  Her 16 Facebook friends.  Right.  All right.  To the next potluck, which implies that she regularly goes to potlucks.  Of course she does.  Potluck.  Yeah, potluck.  It's already become a popular landmark.  Hedricks has people have been stopping to take pictures with it, but I don't imagine anyone 
[02:12:00]  can steal it easily i know from experience it's very hard to move maybe we'll get giant mashed  potatoes next to it and about she's hilarious she's got a lot of jokes she's just having a lot  of fun with this guy this guy doesn't look as pleasant you know if i woke up i hope it's a  gang initiation they start by putting a fucking oversized kfc bucket on your lawn next thing you  know you're whatever drive a truck through your front yeah exactly that's all they do they're a

[02:19:30]  although i've known about you guys for forever quite a while i uh yeah very fucking hilarious  and then when we were looking at pictures of uh the naked uh naked chicks yes at the uh  endless fluffer yeah yeah nudity uh runs wild at the gathering yeah  uh-huh i did i got not with dudes you know right right right no we don't need that 
[02:20:00]  just waste up from that wait how do you get that done though because you know we've we used  to do a lot of road shows and we get the girls to flash but you get like totally totally nude  women to just walk around the whole time let me just say having attended every gathering  in top quality nudity girls top quality oh yeah yeah yeah i'm sure you've seen that in the  photos we saw some top quality and saw some you know a couple of their friends that came along  all i've ever seen is the highest of standards at the gathering that's the way we like it and 
[02:20:30]  nobody nobody you know on a real tip everybody's everybody's accepted i mean um you know you can be  you can be a 600 pound dude walking walking with your shirt off in the heat and uh nobody's even  going to double take take it from me iraq's gonna love going i've built my shirt off plenty of times  yeah yeah nobody's done a double take so much as you know said holy you know everything's always 
[02:21:00]  been great so you're saying nobody should be self-conscious about being not perfect because  nobody gives a shit not together it could be the most hideous broad in the world you know right  right just asshole naked you know what i'm saying uh there's gonna be a dude there like what's up  yeah exactly exactly a lot of a lot of sex going on yes yeah yeah that's pretty cool too i know a  porn girl who is obsessed with you guys and um and i'm obsessed with her she only does like lesbian  porn so she won't let me near her pussy but she's fucking sexy and she goes every year and she says 
[02:21:30]  she's totally naked and she's like it's really weird like nobody touches you or does anything shitty  and and she's like one guy grabbed her and then she's like other people jumped in and like  fucking smashed him and she's like it's it's oddly respectful when you're naked people aren't  fucking that big of animals that's why i walk around that's all their way of hoping to get some  pussy yeah yeah right the white knight fucking guy leave her alone and he's got his dick out  the one that wants to save her it's already hard yeah yeah but i'm just amazed that you got it to the 
[02:22:00]  point where they walk around naked like it didn't start out that way you had to slowly ease into that  well yeah it's it's a badge of freedom you know it's right even if you know even if these people  aren't the type to normally do that you know it's a way of saying man we're free this weekend we're  free for these five days four days whatever it is we're free and that's you know that's why you get  people who maybe not normally flaunt their titties flaunting away because man they just want to wave 
[02:22:30]  that flag you know they just want to yeah advantage of the opportunity i can do this so i'm doing it you  know and and how many people will attend the festival in four days you know it we were talking  about this the other day it swings back and forth you know one one one year to be about 6 000 the  next year to be 16 000 and then we'll put together a killer lineup and we'll be like this year it's  easily going to be 20 000 and then it'll go back down to 6 000. you know what i mean 
[02:23:00]  it goes back down to 6 000. so it really don't it's just wildly different all the time yeah and it's  impossible to get an exact count because so many people sneak in oh really yeah i mean it's just a  campground in the middle yeah it's kind of hard you're not going to fence off a whole friggin  right like crazy acres yeah yeah how did you choose that place how because they say this is  in the middle of nowhere it's hard to get cell service what made that the place you guys look  that's really genuinely is the middle of nowhere yeah straight up i'm talking about man 30 miles 
[02:23:30]  west of nothing and in 45 kilometers near bomb testing sites it's way the middle of boony tunes  and uh and that's another part of the freedom you know because it's not even uh near civilization  cell phones go out 30 miles around the gathering wow people complain about other festivals where  they don't get uh internet cell phones yeah you're going with the wind at the gather you can't have 
[02:24:00]  no cell phone technology you can't have none of that none of that flavor it's like primitive living you  know really yeah wow in this day and age not to have your cell phone for people freak out yeah yeah  your fans have to love you some people freak out over it what what what are some of the events at the  festival for the people that don't know well just just say one thing about the cell phones yeah  strangely enough there's this stone pig it's like a statue yeah that's right i forgot about  and if you stand on top of the pig and lean down and stick your finger in its butthole you will get 
[02:24:30]  reception and i'm serious about that i'm serious all the grounds the only place you gotta go to sit  on the pig or stand on it stick your finger in the in the butthole wow and you get a signal strangely enough  it's wonderful i'd like to see that happen in case of emergencies you are covered right right  mercy stick that finger in the butthole you'll be all right did you guys could you you do everything  yourself and at what point did you say like enough with worrying about record labels and the industry 
[02:25:00]  and the business and we're just going to make this happen with just us like what happened that got you  to that point where you just kind of said fuck it let's do this ourselves because every every label  we've been on you know what i'm saying it's the same old story you know they don't want to market us  they don't know what to do with us and all that you know i'm saying so you know uh i mean we've been  on mad different labels but we never got kicked off a label we always found a loophole to get out or  something you know what i'm saying so when you're marking something like that right so i mean nobody 
[02:25:30]  knows how to do it but us you know so we're just like all right who needs that you know what i'm  saying it's like fuck it i'm making a movie right you're like let's make a western well you know  they want to promote it they want to promote it but there's no you know why make a video nobody's  going to spin it you know no no no no the channels are going to spin it they never have you know right  and uh and they want to be able to support no radio stations are going to play it  you know what i'm saying so it's like how do they do that you know what i'm saying nobody  understands how to do it but us you know even if we have meetings and tell them they never 
[02:26:00]  do it anyhow they wouldn't do it right right right so you guys just do it now with being online the  last 20 years i mean it's gotten better and better and better so it's like it's got to be  it's harder in 1989 to pull off viral stuff it's like a fucking videotape right and now you just  upload it and it's so much easier to not depend on the industry let me tell you about the 1998s physical  work brother i'm serious physical uh pressing up samplers pressing up samplers physically hitting 
[02:26:30]  this town and hitting looking for the strips where all the cars are bumping up and down the avenue  and handing them out left and right you know i'm saying going to the high schools at three o'clock  and when the bell rings i have every exit covered and hitting them up with samplers so every kid  coming out of the high school is getting a sampler and then pack those vans up and roll to the next  town the next day so you're there in the morning you're there at night and out of these high  schools you know thinking of where the most people are going to be so you can hand out these samplers  that was honestly how we did it in the early days you know flyer and sampler we used to look forward to 
[02:27:00]  new year's eve just because we knew the clubs would be full you know what i mean yeah flyer more and we  can get more flyering done you know it was like uh relentless you know that was the way we did it and so  when when bands ask today how do you do it today you know it's different because a lot of the  technology we used to do is gone i mean it's the other way around right we used to literally spend  like 48 hours straight at kinko's you know what i'm saying yeah you'd have to go to the print places  right yeah it's like what do you need kinko's for no shit under windshield wipers we lived at kinko's 
[02:27:30]  man we had all the benefits of kinko's that's fucked up man you paid your dues you really paid your dues and  and did all this legwork that a lot of bands don't have to do or wouldn't be willing to do  and uh had you just depended on the industry they might have let you guys go away it's great that  you didn't let that happen we've been let go away plenty of times you know like just sent you know  just figured uh fuck them you know and but we always find a way to you know keep it moving and and uh 
[02:28:00]  truly the good it's a lot of beauty to be in underground you know what i'm saying and i mean that  when you're underground your destiny is in your hands yeah yeah yeah think about it you know not not  not to say anything's wrong with kid rock but think about being like an artist like well kid  rock's different because he's at that malta huge level right he's at that but think you're in a band  right and uh uh mtv picked up your new single you know you just were released this year you got a hit  single you're in effect you're touring you got this hit single everybody's looking to see who you are 
[02:28:30]  it's all in effect then next year or the year comes after that it's time for your new album you better  hope mtv or whoever is in the same mood they were two years ago yeah when you're doing your cd comes  slant uh flying across their desk because they might be like fuck this man you know what i'm saying  and then if you're done with after that wow yeah no backup plan you know what i mean once somebody  somewhere some once some bigwig says i don't want to fuck with it you know or i'm not feeling that no  more you know my my little sister used to play that shit to death got me bored no more of that you 
[02:29:00]  know what i mean that's it you're done with but at least when you're underground when you're doing  it yourself it's all up to you how successful you want to be only there's a cap you can't be  too successful but at least you can survive and that's a definite you know you can get out there and  pound the pavement and hit the road and stay on the road and stay at work as long as you need  to be relevant right right and to maintain and to be you know part of the industry and it worked 
[02:29:30]  it's hard hard work but at least your fate is in your own hands and it's not up to somebody else who's  having a bad day it says fuck them you know what i mean yeah yeah and then you're bummed out from  that next thing you know your record label drops you it's just not happening like it was a couple  years ago you're sorry right and it sucks because you had nothing to do with it whether that shit was  good or not doesn't matter you know how often are you uh doing stuff for the band is it every day  yeah we have a building every day we have a building with with 30 34 employees in one of them 
[02:30:00]  and and and another building with i believe six employees and uh it's all day every day you know  every every what kind of stuff do they do on our on a regular day because no one really knows the  business of this you know i mean we got like a video department we got like a four guys four guys  working in the video department and they're putting together the the infomercials they're putting  together the regular commercials you know they're putting together our videos they're putting together 
[02:30:30]  a little we got merchandise you know we got we got a whole warehouse just for printing uh uh merchandise  you know we have a web store that ships and orders from anywhere in the world you know but we also have  a web store down the street that actually creates the what the the the screen printing the the web  embroidering all of that shit you know what i mean so we do everything and then you go upstairs we  got people who run the websites not only of ic insane clown posse.com but also all the other 
[02:31:00]  groups on our label you know so we got a hard working gang of people and every morning we sit around  this big presidential table you should see this motherfucking table man i don't know where we got it  but it had to be straight out of the oval office presidential table and it's huge and we sit  everybody sits around it we kind of go around the table and everybody talks about what everybody's  doing that way everybody can give advice to everybody and everybody's kind of involved in 
[02:31:30]  everything going on and um and it's just that is every day man it's hard work but um how long you  guys have been at it since since 1989 wow over 20 years and you guys met in detroit did you guys  come up with any of the other ones we know like eminem and all of them all of them you're all about  the same age well eminem was a little bit different you know kid rock i know you guys uh  didn't really like each other well eminem didn't see odd eye eminem kind of came up a different a  different yeah a whole different route because in detroit when we were coming up that was like the big 
[02:32:00]  thing was you know uh pressing up your own records going around putting my consignment whatnot you  know what i'm saying doing it all yourself right he was more like you know looking for a record  rapping in a circle and you know sending out his demos right right you know that he was taking the  approach which is fine there's two different approaches there's you know prove yourself that  you can sell records by doing it on your own and and waiting for a record label just get  out there and grind and press up you know get your first 500 bucks and press up your first 500 cassettes  sell those and try to order a thousand cassettes you know that route and then there's the other 
[02:32:30]  route where you're you know you're entering the freestyle battles and you're showing you got skills  and talent and um and you're out there grinding trying to get discovered you know yeah yeah another  smart way to do it obviously and so eminem circle was in a circle that we weren't really a part of you  know what i mean we didn't we didn't hang out at the places they hung out at we didn't we didn't really  do the shows with the with the with the the people they were doing shows with it was just different 
[02:33:00]  you know but kid rock was heavily a part of of of what we were doing yeah kid rock was out there  grinding years before you know he made anything happen he was grinding he was i mean he he deserves  everything he's got in reality you know and he's not even our friend we're just saying right right yeah  i mean i don't like him i don't like his music but i gotta respect him you don't like him no no  why why just you know even back in the day when we're all coming up you know he's just just a big 
[02:33:30]  head kid you know what i'm saying yeah but uh you know what i'm saying but you i gotta respect him  like crazy because of you know the grind he put before he blew up into a mega star no one handed it to  him no so yeah yeah yeah but what was the problem with eminem well you know um you know the first  time we ever met him yeah he um he came into a uh a club and um it was it was kind of like  it was a hip-hop night at the club you know and we don't normally go there anyway and and and he was 
[02:34:00]  he you know we usually be outside of the clubs yeah we never was just in clubs hanging out yeah  but for some reason we were up in there that night and he came up to us and gave us a flyer and it  said now mind you didn't nobody know who this guy was i mean you know he didn't have a name out  there or nothing we never we never heard of him we might have heard of the name or something right  that was it but um he gave us a flyer and it said uh come to eminem's record release party um you know  a special guest maybe and it said icp kid rock and esham who were who were like the three top names 
[02:34:30]  of detroit at that time and it said maybe you know they had question marks after and i was like i was  like why do you got a name why do you got our name on there like we might be then he was like  cuz you might be there i'm asking you now well fair enough you know what i'm saying that's not a bad  way to promote it it's kind of ballsy we might be like well maybe dr dre will be at our so so i mean  it's true we might have been there if if everything would have been maybe we would have hit it off that 
[02:35:00]  night being cool you know but uh we were just like man don't promote our name on there with  out without talking to us you know that's just kind of shitty you know and then um and then uh  next thing you know he was blowing up and he was doing little interviews around detroit and he was  dissing us in the paper here and there and saying they don't count clown rap don't count which is  pretty much how we've always been treated you know clowns how you take this shit seriously you know what 
[02:35:30]  i mean to this day to this day we don't get took them seriously yeah yeah so i mean why why should we you  you know we love it now we love not being taken seriously did it was there a point where you  wanted to be taken seriously or did you always just say it just i think in the beginning we  probably wanted to be yeah yeah but but you know we have no complaints of where we're at now no i  i wouldn't doubt it did you ever think of like along that line did you ever think of like kind of 
[02:36:00]  all right we should change this because they're not accepting it not out of artistically we don't  care but like fuck man this is frustrating before you actually went off and did your own thing nope  never thought about changing nothing you know what i'm saying that was just the path that was on you  know and uh you know we were so driven yeah big time we thought what we were doing was so  fucking fresh man it was it was guaranteed to hit man once and it was i mean in detroit it's like we're  like mega stars in detroit you know what i'm saying and that once it started catching everywhere else  that's where it started you know people were like uh you know because you gotta understand in detroit 
[02:36:30]  back in the day you know what i'm saying back in like the early 90s and whatnot everybody that was  coming out of detroit had had some kind of stick to them some kind of gimmick you know what i'm saying  one of the guys on top with his name was esham you know what i'm saying he was like a satanic guy  that rapped about the devil and you know what i'm saying on stage he'd like come out of a coffin and  all that you know then they'd be set up like a graveyard and all that you know then you had kid rock  he was like the hillbilly rapper you know what i'm saying he would be driving a tractor in his videos 
[02:37:00]  right with a cowboy hat on everybody even like kids that were like barely even known or whatever  you know what i'm saying would wear punkin masks or you know what i'm saying they'd be doing whatever  you know everybody was doing that in detroit you know yeah yeah like wrestling they had like a gimmick  you know yeah that was what detroit was doing back then you know and if you think about it  if you really think about it a lot of the rack that throughout detroit's history has been like  that too you know even if they weren't from detroit and if they had a gimmick they did well in in 
[02:37:30]  detroit like kiss like alice cooper you know what i mean if you were doing some old outrageous crazy  shit detroit loves you why detroit doing the outrageous stuff probably because it's outrageous  and crazy to live there it's like a nuclear war zone there yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of outrageous  acts that came from right detroit yeah that's kiss his biggest market i think that was the first one  you guys still out of detroit or have you moved on from living there well you know we we live way 
[02:38:00]  out you know what i'm saying but yeah it's still you know south east of michigan yeah yeah we live  in detroit but we don't live in the city we live on the outside but uh is the city as bad as they say  it's really falling apart yeah there's good parts they try they try like you know building up some of the  shitty parts but there's just too many shitty parts to stay on top of i guess you know what  i'm saying my beef with detroit is you know it's everything's divided by races like one street will  divide you know white people and black people one street for miles you know it's insane on the east 
[02:38:30]  side uh the city called gross point which like butts up against the detroit and there's actually a  fucking wall separating that suburb from detroit in people's backyards you know what i'm saying  it goes right right right a fucking like nine foot tall wall yeah it's insane so these rich people  got this huge wall in their backyard you know and over that wall it's like a ghetto neighborhood you  know and that wall runs for miles and miles it's just up man wow that's my because once we started 
[02:39:00]  traveling we started to see that you know right you'd be like you'd be like at a nice restaurant or  something you know what i'm saying like in the middle of a neighborhood somewhere and you'd be like  you'd be like oh we must be and you'd be like in say i don't know dallas or something you know what  i'm saying and you'd ask the waitress or whatever you'd be like where we actually be like in dallas  well i understand that but like what city outside of dallas yeah you're actually in dallas like oh man  i didn't see the wall what happened you got a fridays in dallas  because we didn't hash it like yeah yeah there wasn't no malls or bennigans or no 
[02:39:30]  shit like that in the city limits what were you doing before uh no 7-elevens in detroit like no no  no they just they'd be ravaged i would gather what what were you doing before the band what did you  work what oh yeah we were well the first i worked over 50 50 jobs i mean you name it i did it from yeah  from car wash to dishwasher and all that but our freshest job was pro wrestling you know we were 
[02:40:00]  wrestlers and shaggy shaggy was my manager for the most part but he was also a wrestler yeah did you  guys uh come close to making it in that world you know later we went to wwe right we had a run there  as as icp right but it wasn't because we were great wrestlers it was because icp right you know i  remember i wish i could sit here and say yeah we did we made it because of our wrestling skills  and we also went to wcw too which was a dream come true you know we could brag about that 
[02:40:30]  shit forever but back in the day before icp we were wrestling around the midwest you know um taking  bookings you know for 75 bucks get out there and only get paid 15 bucks 15 bucks for taking some  bumps all night there's like 20 people you know what i'm saying in the high school gym or the bfw hall  wow that's the independent wrestling circuit man right and sitting in the dressing room with  big fat naked dudes right you're married and you're like 17 years old right there's an 80 year old 
[02:41:00]  guy with his like oh damn balls looking right at you you know just sitting there hey come on let me  give you some advice come here sit out and you're like no just convert an asshole make it who does  that yeah yeah yeah go ahead right you just can't put some underwear or something on it's really easy  to put underpants on it's really not that much of a matter i think i almost stepped on your balls  don't worry about those i can't feel them  you guys wow so but yeah wrestling works fucking hard again don't man that's no you know man we love the 
[02:41:30]  fact that we did wrestling you know what i mean we love every every hardship man we're so happy we're  so proud you gotta understand when you come up with nothing it doesn't take much to to make you  appreciate yeah happiness you know if you come up with little it don't it only takes little to make  you feel like you made it you know how little did you guys come up with what kind of families did  you come from pretty fucking little really close to nothing yeah food stamps powdered milk you 
[02:42:00]  know little hunger barrel hunger barrel money used hunger barrel food used to come to our house oh  yeah yeah yeah the charity organizations i mean real rock bottom one outfit for the school year yeah  that's it oh man yeah when we were little little it was like but you know but listen man you don't  realize it when you're super you know small kid you know that's just life yeah like as a kid you're  just like oh this is kind of we had the best childhood possible though i mean that was going 
[02:42:30]  on yes and that was weighing on our on our on our moms minds you know what i mean but we had the best  fucking childhood possible we were off exploring in the woods we were making the best out of every  situation you know and and honestly man my childhood was was i wouldn't change a thing about it you know  it was so fun and hanging hanging with with each other and each other's brothers and the four of  us doing things man we just you know we conquered the world so you knew each other's your whole 
[02:43:00]  life yeah i was like 10 years old really wow but it wasn't bad when you found some money  yeah that's pretty good that made being poor a lot easier  before a long long time though every little bit of money that came went back into the pot nice back into  the pot back into the pot you know yeah yeah and you guys just believed because at any moment that it  wouldn't there was a chance it wasn't gonna work out for you well it was like everything was going  back into the pot right and then once more and more money was coming into the pot you know little 
[02:43:30]  things started becoming like you know like like we would we would be making nothing right but every  once in a while we'd ask our manager hey man can i get a new pair of shoes and once those the  yeses became easier yeah yeah you realize oh okay but what was the what was the first big thing you  bought where you went oh a pair of shoes those shoes those 50 those fresh ass 50 hookups were pretty 
[02:44:00]  fresh you know like we were like this is rap money this is fucking rap money right here man high-fiving  each other you know yeah you understand there was like especially back then there was no big love  some of money that came in so there was no no person was like man we made it you know what i'm  saying it's like okay you finally get a used shitty car yeah really slowly it just you know we'd come  in we lived in we had a uh 250 apartment with a transvestite who hung out on the front porch  and uh and and we and and like a homeless transvestite and uh and uh we lived in an area called cast 
[02:44:30]  corridor detroit and we and we lived um and we lived in one apartment me and shaggy and billy  and and then my brother somehow this is a one bedroom apartment you know and we were right next  to each other and once again you know does everything suck it's supposed to but we were just so focused  and dedicated on what we were doing it's awesome man and when you have the right people you're hanging 
[02:45:00]  out with like that you could just laugh about it doesn't matter you know it makes it that much  better yeah yeah yeah we brought girls over the house we'd be like yeah we're broke you know we  try to use that as our you know that's that's you're in yeah we're broke we try to spin it out  and you know what you're too good because we're broke you know no it's not like that yeah you know  i actually remember that game oh you're too good for us i could spit that game today man i remember  using that did you guys have bad management at all like did you ever have a point every artist 
[02:45:30]  musically seems like they go through that thing where the fucking managers steal their money and  did you have to deal with that at first or did you uh were you able to kind of avoid that  our manager was never a stranger you know what i'm saying it wasn't just somebody we hired you know  what i'm saying it was always you know since we're we've only had two in our whole career you know  right yeah two men the first one was the guy that started off everything with us and the second guy is  our lifelong friend you know what i'm saying and our first manager came at us about 10 years ago or  something you know we've been around 22 years and he came around us maybe eight years ago and he said 
[02:46:00]  look man you know we got we got platinum and gold albums on the wall we pretty much accomplished  everything we set out to do when you guys came to me and asked me to be your managers it was never my  goal or dream to be a manager you know i agreed to do it then and it was interesting and we did it  now we've done all this came all this way you guys are doing really good you know i'm gonna step  out you know what i'm saying like i'm gonna step out because i want to do something else in my life 
[02:46:30]  as well i've did this this was your guys's dream i'm gonna step out you know what i mean he stepped  out and then it wasn't you know wasn't a couple wasn't until a couple years later when we put um our  friend who's now our manager billy bill in position that we found out he left with millions  and millions oh your ex the ex manager oh how do you do it that's all right man it's all good but 
[02:47:00]  how do you do it what are you snake he left us with a lot of bills you know what i mean a lot of uh  manufacturing bills and crazy see we always knew he was a super duper like venomous snake you know  what i'm saying but our thing was but he's our snake he's snaking for us that's right we knew he  was filthy but we figured he was filthy for us right right he bit you a little when he was slithering  away huh wow so do you guys now you're probably more like managing your money and and being like  because you seem like good business man like you guys know what you want you know how to get it done 
[02:47:30]  so you now you're probably more focused on let's you know keep our eye on everything so no one can do  that again oh yeah well the guy that's with us uh has been with us from day day one  you know he was in our squad he also dropped out in ninth grade right we all used to do a  when we were kids we all used to do a paper route together you know and so we've been with him  forever you know and then like the guy out there managing us today on the road that's my brother  you know he's been with us from day obviously you know yeah we got a very small uh close-knit family 
[02:48:00]  the people at the office and all those employees and stuff like that you know a lot of those are  are friends from the past a lot of them aren't but we don't let anybody get too close you know  what i'm saying we keep everybody in good positions when they're happy and and and and we don't want  anybody to grow mad or salty you know what i mean right yeah you guys want to shoot something this is  a question i i i have all these ideas of these things i just it doesn't come to fruition say you say 
[02:48:30]  let's shoot this video i want to do this who do you have a guy in your camp that just will kind  of put everything together like a production guy like you'll say hey whoever we want to do this  make it happen and he lines up everything and says okay well if you want to do it i got the crew and  we'll do it yeah yeah his name is brian kuma and we'll go right to him just like you said you know  we want to shoot a video for this location you know and he'll be like grab his pen and get all excited  and then we'll be like he'll be like what do you want to do you know do you have any ideas and get 
[02:49:00]  all he'll get all excited and geeked up and then we'll be like yeah we want to you know if we have  any if we don't have any ideas we'll be like come on man we just you start thinking about it you know  and then he'll start thinking about it come back a couple days got some flavor on the mind you know  but that man we got a lot of really really really bomb ass employees back there man we were really  blessed man super blessed you know if you're getting into any uh brawls with anybody that you  work with like sometimes you know you're close like that friends working together kind of mix it up 
[02:49:30]  every so often you ever know absolutely never had to punch anyone in the face not as far as people  that you know what i'm saying right right right there's an old psychopathic rule you know an old  psychopathic rule if you fight with anybody if you're about to get into a fight with somebody you're mad  enough where you're about to fist fight and the other guy wants to fight too you both have to get  naked and fight butthole naked therefore suddenly you're two men rolling around naked with each 
[02:50:00]  other there's a lot of fights i can imagine if you want to fight you can fight like that you know  what i mean that's hilarious that way we're laughing at both of you while you're doing it yeah no  sam's a big fan you got a question there sam i yeah i can ask you questions all day uh on the  wrestling thing where was the toughest locker room to deal with because i would imagine you  know you guys said you come in not because you're great wrestlers because you're the icp that probably  didn't sit well wwf was it was uh it was uh you know that was the most like trying for us you know 
[02:50:30]  what i'm saying because every everybody that was in wwf or wwe now whatever it's supposed to be called  yeah but uh you don't say that they were like well you're not wrestlers so they you know what i'm saying  they you'd be getting punched for real and stuff we had some drama you know but but are you talking  about why they didn't like that you had some some heat so they're gonna make it hurt a little bit  right we got into it yeah in wwe like a lot of wrestlers didn't respect the fact we were there 
[02:51:00]  right yeah so so they would go over backstage what we were gonna do and then when we got out there it  was it was fight time wow you know and that wasn't with everybody that was only with the guys that  were our age the legends like the road warriors or something you get out there and it would be  easy as hell they would be cool as hell with you you know but if you were fighting wrestling some  up-and-comer group your age did they feel like you're threatening their spot look out man anyone  you would name yeah they would give you the beat down no i mean do you name names or no anyone that 
[02:51:30]  gave you a good beating there are friends now yeah we're friends with them you know groups like for  wrestling fans the headbangers we we went toe-to-toe with the headbangers you know man and um and they  would and then they would come busting in the dressing room after the show was over and be like  how was it how was it guys and we'd be like good man wow great just we didn't want to  bitch you know what i mean we didn't want to sound like pussies you know so we'd be like it was great  it was great you know the whole thing with with like me and uh the whole wrestling thing 
[02:52:00]  is it i can't stand being in the locker rooms they're like horrible to me you don't say  number one the nudity you know i just hate the whole politics of like you know behind the scenes  politics of wrestling you know what i'm saying it's just crazy it's like everybody just you know  what i'm saying especially like when you got tv involved you know just backstabbing and hating  each other for like 30 seconds of tv time and whatnot you know about this it's crazy man it's crazy let's 
[02:52:30]  say a wrestling show is two hours long right a concert is two hours long a wrestling show you  got 20 wrestlers all jocking for position you know what i mean they all want that shine they go out  there they only get the spotlight for a little bit as as for a band goes out there and they can play  by themselves for an hour or but wrestlers go out there they got 10 minutes at the most to shine so  they want to you know backstage it's all like you know a lot of a lot of conniving and and and you 
[02:53:00]  know shucking and jiving and and and people wanting to you know stab somebody for that spot man you know  great it's funny uh the the show you guys have on uh fuse it's on when it's called the same clown posse  theater and it's on wednesdays at 11 o'clock and uh they asked me to to to do it and to go on and uh i  didn't i didn't recognize greg valentine i didn't realize that was the hammer of course until he  until he came i was you know at first i thought it was like some guy with a wig who's pretending to be 
[02:53:30]  a lady i'm like who is that and then when he he guides me off at the end i'm like this is  fucking great i think i even said that you're the hammer i couldn't fucking believe you got him to  just stand there that silly fucking hat it was unbelievable that he was a part of that show  oh yeah man he was the first guy we called you know he's got the perfect face we figured you  know we wanted the character where something funny goes off and everybody's laughing and then you cut 
[02:54:00]  to the guy who doesn't find it funny at all that's the face what a better face you know he's perfect for  it right you know nothing's funny about that shit however he's laughing all the time yeah yeah he's not  the kind of guy that you know that's just nature so that's cool too you know we we love him however he  comes you know he was very pleasant he was surprisingly nice off the air he's like oh i  really enjoy your stuff i was like jesus the hammer said talk to this pleasantly it was weird when you  see people off camera how nice they are sam what are we what are we missing here well what about i'm 
[02:54:30]  wondering about critics because obviously you guys are saying you don't get taken seriously and you get  a lot of heat in print and in radio and stuff but these are people that don't have to deal with you  face to face like when you when you meet people face to face do you find that they're singing a  different song no question they do of course that's that's everybody right it is right that's  most critics the thing about critics is whatever they're critiquing and whatever uh whatever like  a music critic or a movie critic nine times out of ten they're somebody who failed at that profession 
[02:55:00]  you know what i'm saying like music critics you know they're probably like in some stale band you  know what i'm saying but usually they've tried to break into the business and they flopped you know  they're a little bitter they've had a record late uh deal and they just were shitty and it  fell apart you know what i'm saying so that's their main goal in life now is to sit there and  rip other people apart because they suck because they want to contribute and be a part of it somehow  and and they can't do it on the artistic side so they figure well i'll get the respect of the  artist and be a member of this community by sitting there and critiquing and that's not  that's even like movie critics like what's the guy that had no fucking chin or whatever then 
[02:55:30]  jim norton yeah he's got like super shitty movies he directed back in the day that are just  horrible you know what i'm saying so what does he do later on because a movie critic you know  what i'm saying just disses everything you know boy his shit's the worst ever i remember when we  were first coming up you know in like 1995 or something spin magazine called us and they were  like we want to do a story on you guys we were like we were still basically local then we were like 
[02:56:00]  hell yeah spin magazine what so then this four piece or four or five page comic strip about us comes out  about two months later and it portrays us in the most horrible horrible light you know totally  dissing the hell out of us totally dissing the juggalos calling calling you know making  us trying to be racist racist and all kind of ill shit and who wrote it two guys that were in a band  called big chief back in the day they were this close to making it from detroit but just didn't quite 
[02:56:30]  do it so then they see icp blowing through all the blowing past them doing better than a lot of  bands and they just had so much anger in them they they somehow worked it out and they were the ones  that wrote that story you know and these were our friends man you know what i mean wow man just jealous  just fucking jealous fullest man i'll never forget that because that was the first time that happened  and from there i've seen a career full of it do you guys get black crowds as well as white crowd like 
[02:57:00]  do you like because uh was there any resistance from from black audiences to you guys being being  white and hip-hop or no no not really no resistance nobody nobody's saying you know coming and having a  beef about it you know but i'd say our audiences are mostly white but depends on where you're at in the  country you know but um i try not to i just try not to pay attention yeah yeah and it's all it's all 
[02:57:30]  fine by us you know what i mean and the event the uh the gathering of the juggalos is uh august 7th  through the 11th and i am performing there on the friday night oh yeah charlie murphy is there i think  on the saturday uh in the comedy tent uh cool juggalo gathering.com for tickets and all the information  you want and uh juggalo has two g's in it but i'm actually i was no more or two and afraid of this  gig all at the same time like it could be terrible and frightening but or it could be  fucking great but i have no fear it'll be great well i want to know more about the gathering in 
[02:58:00]  general like what goes on you guys perform every day obviously um we do something every day but  we there's we do three like main performances our set uh uh a set of the set for another group  where it's called dark lotus and another uh group called psychopathic writers we have uh but we  do like in store you know we do like you know seminars seminars seminars on what uh us you know 
[02:58:30]  like like giving all the news of what we're going to be doing in the next year every day we have  seminars different people that are there will do like seminars a lot of people just kind of do like  a q a you know right right yeah seminars go but we like just drop news you know what i'm saying  tell everybody what our future plans are for the next year what we're going to be up to  and then and then like shaggy said you know there's icp which is me and shaggy of course  and then there's also uh super groups on our label there's two of them one of them was called dark  lotus which is made up of icp and a group called twisted and another uh called blaze your dead homie 
[02:59:00]  the five of us come together and form as dark lotus we don't get the tour but maybe once every three  years however we play every year at the gathering you know and that's a big deal for the juggalos do  you wear the makeup when you're in lotus uh we wear masks or we wear a different type of makeup right  you know and then there's also psychopathic riders which is uh the same five under um gang wear like 
[02:59:30]  you know like crips and bloods and we just totally jack other people's beats and just do like spit like  ridiculous gangster rap over we say fuck copyright and we just use everybody's beats and we sell it  we sell it over the internet right it's not like a mixtape where people pull it out of the internet  for free rapping over people's shit we sell it we sell it and we put it out and we don't even  out where it says the label it doesn't say psychopathic records our label it says joe and joey records you 
[03:00:00]  you know and it says copy wrong hey do you guys ever because like you're listening to you like  you see really smart business guys and like colleges or people that have these uh speakers come in and  talk about the business or music they should ask you to come in and talk because i think what you do  is more inspirational to a an artist who is struggling and new than to have somebody who has just made it  a conventional way because your way is a way that guys can actually go out and really try to push  themselves as opposed to just waiting for someone to recognize them well you know um yeah i i uh i think 
[03:00:30]  there's so much you can do today though with the internet alone you know that even beyond what we  could tell them like right there's i mean there's so many people that got you know with major major  deals that like started out from a viral video you know like today groups are blowing up off viral  videos is what i'm trying to say i think that's the quickest route like if you can think of  something uh um you know witty and and you know you know attention deserving and fresh to stick out 
[03:01:00]  there for for 10 minutes or even four minutes up on youtube you can blow up off that right i mean even  even if like you know saying your music sucks and you got but you got an awesome video like what's  that that rapper soldier boy you know what i'm saying it was just horrendous but he was so large  you know what i'm saying because of youtube you know and so did justin bieber you know he grew up off 
[03:01:30]  youtube and endless and a lot of guys are doing it you know and and even if you're not able to dance or  be cute or any of that you can take your music and put it to something some footage that's good and put it  on youtube like maybe all car crashes you know you can't take your eyes off that so everybody so  that's just going viral everybody's watching car crash after car crash but they're listening to your  shit you see what i'm saying i mean the internet is really still opening doors that we're still trying 
[03:02:00]  to run through man i feel it i feel weird in a position trying to teach when when we're still so  much learning you know yeah yeah but it's still it's still a direction i think that's really really  most people wouldn't go in and uh you wind up doing it and making it like it's instead of dropping out  and listening to the labels you fucking you went and you made it which is amazing because the labels  don't know they're no they're no superheroes they don't know more than any of us you know when you 
[03:02:30]  guys are sitting around and thinking about what's best for your band you're probably right you know what  i mean yeah and no label knows more than you just deserve a record label right they just got a lot  of money and connections you know what i'm saying they throw a lot of money at the radio programmers  they throw a lot of money at mtv or whatever video outlet you know saying to get spun that's the only  benefit they have over independent people you get to the label you start talking to people at the label  and you find out these guys don't really know man yeah yeah i thought this this is where the you know 
[03:03:00]  this is where the geniuses were and this is how to hold the matrix that's what every business you  you realize uh from everything from your first job maybe washing dishes in a restaurant you realize  the guy that runs the restaurants a fucking asshole he doesn't know anything up to anything and and  you go and you you think it's like it's got to get different at a certain point where someone's got  to know what the fuck they're doing you realize no right no one knows what the fuck they're doing  except you yes you know what's best for you and what you want to do that's right and speaking of the 
[03:03:30]  viral videos you guys have had a few uh miracles being one of them of course and i just checked my twitter  everyone's like you gotta ask them about magnets yeah gotta ask them about the magnets well you  know were you surprised by the success of that yeah yeah big time yeah super how big does that get  it didn't go like you know yeah it's no side numbers  but you were pretty impressed by how many views it was insane you know what i'm saying yeah it's crazy 
[03:04:00]  i like the fact you're honest too like you know you said one year you'll have six thousand the next  year sixteen thousand and then next year six thousand like that's there's an honesty in that  which is great and too many people are obsessed with self-promotion just don't tell the truth about  yeah that's great especially with us you know people love digging into our  shit and like trying to expose us for being  bullshit you know what i'm saying so i mean we if we ain't truthful somebody's gonna dig into  and be like oh you're liars you know what i'm saying yeah how many how many years have you been at  it now as far as the gatherings go oh this is the 13th and 13th no 14th wow 
[03:04:30]  fucking amazing that is cool what about the uh what's that shit with like  fucking what is that the fbi saying gang oh the generalist again like that's straight  bullshit is what that once again you know people people fear what they don't understand you know  and uh and nobody knows what the hell we're doing we don't count you know people don't look at us as a  real band they say man this these idiots out here why are they here you know and so even even the 
[03:05:00]  government looks at all our fans getting together and they say uh they're a gang you know i mean  they've actually named juggalos our fans a gang now meanwhile you wouldn't get that from another band  and they're fans like you're saying oh i think they're yeah the believers they're a gang lady gaga's  little monsters are a gang yeah you know what i'm saying that's what that is that just seems like  it's it's unbelievable i thought it was funny but then you look at it the way it affects people you 
[03:05:30]  know people that they maybe have your your charm on or this tattooed on their arm or something and they  get pulled over next thing you know they get written up as a gang member they get busted later with a  a little pot in their weed a little weed in their pocket or something they get they get sentenced  as a gang member now yeah wow not you know people try to join the army they got this tatted on their  arm they don't get let in because they looked at as a gang member where did the misunderstanding uh 
[03:06:00]  start huh where did it start where all of a sudden they decided to name you guys a gang or the  the fans misunderstanding started when we came out i'm being honest right like there was never a  time when they were like it wasn't based on some dumb little little incident that happened and they  blew it out of proportion or anything the whole thing is is crazy because like you know you got a  group of people that are so large you know what i'm saying you're gonna have all walks of life 
[03:06:30]  you're gonna have some crazy people you're gonna have some kids that happen to do be in gangs you  know what i'm saying but like you don't say because like some hardcore south side chicago kid  is in a gang it happens to be a juggalo doesn't mean that some kid in spokane washington that you  know in the suburbs living with leave it the beaver style that happens to be a juggalo is in a gang  you know what i'm saying right so it's like they put their finger like everybody's a gang because  there are you know some yeah you're gonna tell me that there's not people that love john cougar 
[03:07:00]  melancamp that happened to be in a gang you're talking to three of them oh pink houses it's  terrific i love john cougar melancamp i'm not in a gang but you know what i'm saying i was a kid i  was you love the man or his music because we had the music yeah we had him in he's a little rough did  he come in oh a few times at any w really i'm just saying like anybody like that you know what i'm saying  yeah steely dan i'm sure his gang members listen to steely dan you know what i'm saying sure  but we're fitting it you know we're soon yeah you know we're not good we're not just gonna if we 
[03:07:30]  don't sue them and the years go by with the fbi saying that juggalos are a gang eventually the  world would just accept it that they are and they would be and that's it take our entire legacy and  on it you know yeah i don't know if you can actually win in suing the fbi you know what i mean yeah  you actually win something like that but we'll die fighting it wow we'll go broke fighting it you still  get audited every year oh my god you know not doing anything about it right it's the worst thing  yeah yeah yeah what about the movies how well do they do we saw a clip of the uh the western yeah 
[03:08:00]  this morning it's still it made us laugh man big time it's still doing you know like uh showtime you  know she plays on showtime all the time you know what i'm saying yeah it's still going it's still going  it's a movie's a cool thing because it's so nice it doesn't have to only be hot the year it comes  out you know we keep looking for new deals and new places to get to play it you know and so it's still 
[03:08:30]  going you know yeah you guys we're happy with it how long did it take you guys to do that because the  video quality like the production value in the small clip we saw it was really good it wasn't like  you guys did with a home video camera it was looked like it was professionally done it was decent yeah  yeah really decent a lot of surprise cameos from people in it it's a lot of fun to watch it's laced  with you know funny cameos from people well that that's actually what is like the inspiration  originally for it was uh like you said like with video cameras and stuff because back in the day like  masterpiece movies before he got like serious about it you know just a home video a lot of rappers 
[03:09:00]  were doing that especially like b rappers and stuff you know they try to like come on the record with a  you know a hood movie or whatever it's just so shitty because you know it was a video camera you  know and we saw it watch those movies and love them because they're so cheesy and shitty you know  what i'm saying so like back in uh 1999 we uh we did a movie called big money hustlers and it was kind  of like a spoof up those kind of movies but it was done good you know what i'm saying done professionally  so but it was done like you know just like big money hustler style or rustler style you know what  i'm saying just silly shit through the whole thing yeah and then um then uh but that that was like you 
[03:09:30]  know uh island back in the day getting involved in it and you know what i'm saying they threw crazy money at  it and whatnot you know what i'm saying and then um a few years before we did big money uh rustlers  we did a um super b shitty flick called uh death racers which you know is a b flick of death racer  that was as a favorite to a friend right it's right right well our friend out in la right sort of right  and uh we see we seen how he's doing it and we were like we don't need you know saying some company 
[03:10:00]  behind it we could do this you don't say if he's doing this we could do it but you know what i'm saying  with a higher budget you know what i'm saying and then so you just from learning what we learned  from that shitty movie you know what i'm saying we were like well let's make a sweet movie doing  the same shit you know and that's you know we got we got three movies out two of them we put out  um only big money hustlers the latest one the western that's rust was the one fully we did  that that's the one that's hilarious i like i like how the the the lingo has nothing to do with the old 
[03:10:30]  west wait a minute what and the cowboy hat's on with the makeup and you got nine but he's not  concerned with the the makeup or anything it's just the nine cards that he has an issue with like why  you dress like that with the west it's hilarious the whole movie is stupid like hey yeah yeah yeah  it's like airplane you know right old school style like that sure great movie where do you guys stay  when you're uh when you're at the campground you guys just stay intense or do you kind of come and go 
[03:11:00]  because i got a bus oh you do have a bus you stay on the bus yeah yeah and we cruise around on golf  carts and and check everything out check the comedy out check the wrestling out check the women's oil  wrestling out check check everything that's going on you know there's all sorts of fun activities like  they call one one of them is night court and it's where juggalos get out there and have court against  each other and there's like a celebrity judge and celebrity attorneys you know right that's the thing about  the gathering uh it doesn't stop it's 24 hours something's going on you know there's not like a 
[03:11:30]  a period of time where there's a down time you know from like six in the morning until like five  no it's 24 hours it's basically the least effective from six in the morning till like one in the afternoon  yeah that's what i said but even even even then there's still kids that do shit at their own  candidates hundreds of zombies walking around no yeah a lot of sleep deprivation going on mixed with  drugs there's hundreds of zombies walk around who are clearly asleep right they're just walking you 
[03:12:00]  just see the fog and the in the ash from fires and shit it's crazy wow the first one when you did the  first one 14 years ago whatever it was like was that a smaller one that's obviously blown up into  something oh yeah yeah definitely yeah the first one first two or three two i should say were held in  inside of um yeah through the first three the first one was just a convention center yeah the first one  was just a convention center then uh the second and third one were convention center slash hotel 
[03:12:30]  things you know so there was a riot one time because somebody showed their tits yeah somebody punched a  police horse in the face oh man all kinds of craziness happening and we didn't know what we  were going to do and then we decided to try it outdoors and little did we know honestly we had no  idea so we did that first one outdoors and the police weren't allowed on the grounds because it's  private property and it was just euphoria of flavor to be honest that's that's like a big reason why 
[03:13:00]  you know any kind of violence whatsoever is so minimal because there's no police there you know  i'm saying there's no put the bullies ain't there you know what i'm saying like put that down you  can't do that and every time that somebody writes about the violence at the gathering they say well  there was already a stabbing you know they don't write that it was between two hot dog vendors you  know what i'm saying right nothing to do with us juggalos nothing you know yeah right they're battling  over prices oh man yeah hot dog ones or something you know they want to make it sound like it's all 
[03:13:30]  violence but to be a juggalo is not easy okay to be an icp fan to go around waving that  flag it's not a well-received thing you know people are not like oh you're a juggalo cool dude you  know you listen to them idiots you know and and so it's not easy being a juggalo however therefore  when you get to a concert or you get to somewhere like the gathering and you're surrounded by people  who share the same interests as you and they share the same type of you know love for things it's like 
[03:14:00]  the ice is immediately broken and these people are your friends these people are your family and  it's like you'll see i promise you when you get there you'll be like man the minute you walk in  you can just feel the love man and that's the real beauty everybody that follows icp the juggalos so to  speak they know the real beauty in being a juggalo is not shaggy and violent jay you know we just  provide the soundtrack the real beauty is being a juggalo man that's i mean in being around other 
[03:14:30]  juggalos and being a part of something and not being alone that's the real beauty of of what the  the dark carnival is and we just make hard songs you know i'm saying and jim you will be part of that  yes uh i'm performing uh not this friday but a week from this friday on the 9th i'll be there  it's 11 o'clock show in the comedy tent and uh and again if you're there the whole weekend of the  whole week charlie murphy is uh headlining the next night so i i'm actually looking forward to it

[03:17:00]  the mic there and you kind of just asked a basic question and you moved on i thought you were going  to give us some inside shit that we didn't know about with the insane clown posse well i kind of i'm  not saying you did shitty it was like it was just you know mediocre at best that's not cool well i  mean i poured on all the information earlier and i don't like to take over your interviews i don't  give a fuck yeah but you know look what's on the wall it says opie and anthony so i don't give a  fuck that's it in the end people go wow the opie and anthony show is great today you're cemented 
[03:17:30]  well they're cool i like them a lot yeah i thought we did uh all right for our first time with insane  clown posse yeah so i don't know i told liam if they got any more time bring them back in in like  20 minutes yeah just hammer them about uh miracles and and they like promoting so  they'll absolutely come back in yeah what was miracles about i'm gonna go check that out online  uh it was just it was huge for a second like it was to me i think it kind of uh 
[03:18:00]  almost took their career in a whole different direction like i think that's what made them into  kind of people started appreciating them from a comedic standpoint right like i think that's what  led to stuff like this fuse show and the other viral videos because people were like what the  fuck is this because they're dressed up almost like angels right and they're just talking about all  these crazy things that happened in the world but like things that science has proven like 
[03:18:30]  magnets is the famous line right and all that's how do they work but they're attributing it to  miracles of god instead of science that was proven hundreds of years ago you know what i mean and  so people flipped out over it magnets are pretty fucked up i mean they're crazy magnets and water  are two things that are just really fucked up if you start thinking about it it's true but if you  really want to think about it you just get some books and they're very much explained by science  like they're not mysteries anymore that's good if you're a scientist or somebody who can read the 
[03:19:00]  average person is still pretty fucked up all you have to do is figure out i was looking at ocean waves  all weekend yeah it's pretty fucked up and this thing with human water what's making those  fucking waves do what they do now i know there's a real answer to that but it's pretty fucked up when  you're sitting there going that's pretty fucked up i i get that but your brother's also a marine biologist  and why does the water come up to the almost the exact point every single fucking day that's  weird why wouldn't you ask the guy who knows i don't want to i don't need the scientific reason  you don't want the answer you just want to be able to appreciate the world i just want to like look 
[03:19:30]  at it and go wow that's pretty fucked up if you just break it down to nothingness and that instead  of trying to go for the the uh explanation and that's what miracles is all about yeah all right you  know what i mean like i could relate to that shit then like i think they're on the same level as you with  that like i understand there's a uh scientific explanation for magnets but fuck it that seems  magic i'm at the beach right right i'm looking at the ocean when does the water stop uh soaking into  the sand i i guess at the end of the time right what do you mean when it's no like in the middle 
[03:20:00]  of the ocean you know if you dig there's like water in the underneath too it's saturated right when  does the saturation end and why i don't know you fucked me up okay i don't know you  fucked me up now my head's fucked up to me all right yeah is that what you do instead of like  instead of smoking pot you just think of questions yeah people are going to smoke a pot again because  of these weird fucking things i think about but it's weird isn't that weird yeah and i don't want  to know the answer you just want to be able to be fucked up you want to be able to sit down it's the rock 
[03:20:30]  bed it's this it's that whatever when does the saturation end and why but you don't actually  want to know nah but you actually went and went so far as to say when and why right but neither of  those two things are things you actually want to know no you'd like to talk about it you like to  explore it yeah i don't i don't really need the answer but when somebody comes at you with some like  well it says right here you're like no you're out bro you're not hanging out we're at the beach my  new thing i dig holes in the sand until i hit water and i go wow that's pretty fucked up 
[03:21:00]  that's like what like a like a seven-year-old might do yeah yeah yeah i turn my brain off when i go to  the ocean now and you're like i get it like you and your kid are just sitting there digging holes  and you're both on that level and i start wow and i start going wow the sand's getting a little  wetter a little moister yeah and the next thing you know the water starts pouring in i'm like that's  fucked up i gotta tell you something what i know i try to be logical most of the time but i was 
[03:21:30]  watching that naked and afraid show and at some point the guy found he was trying to find water and  so he went to the greenest part of the jungle sure and he just started digging and digging because  he goes there's water at the greenest part of the jungle right it's the middle of the island  though so i'm going no way right he digs and he digs like six feet down and he found the water  there's water you don't find that fucked up i gotta tell you something when i looked at that  was it the highest point of the island i was like that's fucked up thank you that's  fucked up because we're idiots we would like to get the shallow uh part of the island of course then 
[03:22:00]  he drank it and he gave him uh horrible diarrhea when he had no clothes and was stuck on an island  so fucking idiot but isn't diarrhea easier if you don't have clothes on yes okay no stains on  nothing you just fucking blast fucking trees with your diarrhea they checked over and just blast  the naked girl that he was with on because you know it's like survivor but everybody's naked yeah  and the girl that he was with on the island got super pissed at him because she stepped in a  puddle of his diarrhea oh really because he went right by camp but she's just stupid but you're not 
[03:22:30]  supposed you always have to be on the lookout for diarrhea but she also said the rule always is to go  away from camp like when you're that close to camp you shouldn't have to worry about diarrhea piles  broads are just dumb you should just in life i'm gonna walk home right now uh-huh and i'm gonna be  on the lookout for diarrhea the entire time and guess who takes their eye off the diarrhea thing  guess who's not gonna step in diarrhea i can promise you i will not step in diarrhea the only  time i step in dog poo is because i get distracted by somebody language and when you do you know that's 
[03:23:00]  your fault it is at that point you should have been on the lookout for dog human raccoon diarrhea  yes always always and people see they have the answer to my questions i don't need i don't  that's not what you're looking for answer for the same question if you want it okay fine  uh go ahead charlie hello hey charlie question is that uh sand can't hold water since it has a loading  uh see see like this all right but that's not what i'm getting at no yeah but the thing with the 
[03:23:30]  sand is sand will only be wet it makes sense when you dig a hole because it's only as wet as far down  at the water level i feel like i'm in class i know i'm hitting the actual water level i'm not  i i get it but i don't forget it i feel like i'm in class yeah you're you're boring us  all right how about this you go out into the ocean uh let's let's say a hunt oh he's gone good 100  feet yeah when so you're swimming out from the shore about 100 feet all right and then obviously you 
[03:24:00]  know there's sand right and then that sand is pretty fucking moist filled with water  fuck yeah how far do you go down before that ends and it's just fucking dry meaning in the water  start digging right well you can't dig obviously no you'd have to drill right and how long and yeah  and the drill doesn't let water into the hole you're drilling how long would it take before you got  completely dry sand i would think high tide and not too far because that's only high tide but low tide 
[03:24:30]  you're talking about some shit that gets no you're in the water i know but if it's high tide the water  doesn't spend that much time saturating the sand but if it's low tide and you're at shore even when  it's high tide the water is still there you know i'm saying right so that saying gets saturated 24 7  at low like i heard know what i'm saying today you know i'm saying yeah i think i know what you're  saying fucking magnets i love magnets all right sam this is going nowhere do you like uh what do we  can the premise went nowhere you said you wouldn't accept the real answer there was no possible way 
[03:25:00]  for it to go anywhere i've been struggling i'll just leave you hanging all right that didn't go nowhere  no no i don't like any real it was just a ridiculous concept from the get-go did you like icp today yeah i  liked them a lot they were awesome right they worked really fucking hard because in this day and age  everyone i mean we see with our dumb fucking radio show you get interns and shit they come well i  fucking showed up for a week where's my job right and you know and this is like old school i don't 
[03:25:30]  see a lot of people out there working really hard at their craft anymore not only matter what it is  but they continued to work hard and adapt right like they continued when the internet started taking  over they embraced it and they start working with that and they just keep going and going they don't  say well i worked hard for 10 years now this internet thing is taking off our audience will just find us  kids today they don't they don't understand working for 10 years they don't understand for 10 minutes  right zito's sleeping while the show's on oh fuck that kid right i don't even i don't even hate him  because i don't know him but troy does i don't i don't whatever i think he was useless up there in 
[03:26:00]  montreal oh don't forget to click on my uh my homeless uh video from montreal for some reason doing  really really well oh yeah yeah i walked out of a um where would where we go for steak moist  moisture's moisture's walked out after a really really nice steak uh dinner with all you guys  and a lot of wine because that fucking uh i'm gonna blame the waiter i should blame myself was  just kept pouring wine like it was water you and i even went into the fucking steak dinner going i'm 
[03:26:30]  not gonna i'm not gonna really drink too much because we got a show the next day right i got  pretty uh pretty hammered you should have been there the next night because you went to the same joint  no we went no i meant at dinner the next night went to an italian place right but roland was the  wine taster right and the way roland tastes wine is they poured you know a little taste of wine in  the glass and he roland you know he does the shaking so he can test with his eyes and then he just chugs  the whole thing back jesus he probably drank two bottles of wine at dinner really on friday yeah 
[03:27:00]  roland's fun to hang out with on the road course he is he's nuts because he's got no uh self-value so he'll  just destroy himself for other people's amusement right well then i left the steak joint walked out  the front door and there was a guy right in front of me with a cup a homeless guy in montreal and we  had a nice little chat and for some reason that one's doing really well so i think erock's gonna  put it on the facebook page hopefully i got stuck in the bathroom or go to my youtube channel op radio  is the first video i think that pops up it's my latest video sick just give it some clicks roland you 
[03:27:30]  have fun in uh montreal i love montreal it was a good time it was a great time we gotta hit the road more  off drank snap my napkin at the waiter i gotta tell you what did you just say i think stack his uh  napkin oh snapped yeah yeah he was oh snapping his neck the waiter jizzed all over troy's food yeah  his balls in there because troy was making blowjob gestures while the waiter was going over the night  specials well i definitely feel like there's a weird i don't know like like the french some of the french  don't like americans and they make it very clear yeah because montreal is very separatist like they don't 
[03:28:00]  not only do they not speak english they don't want anybody speaking english there right and that's  stupid for business they're gonna lose a lot of uh tourism if they go through with that they want  all maybe they'll give a fuck in the end they want to be like well what happens if you're from new  york and you cross the border quebec wants you'll decide to go to toronto instead because they they'll  they'll accept your english every like five to seven years quebec wants to secede from canada  all together right they want to be a sovereign nation well i think it's dumb from a business 
[03:28:30]  standpoint but of course it is as i say bonjour bonjourno all right enjoy the after show all right  man when roland uh shows up i know it's my cue to get the fuck out of here yeah he stresses people out  what the fuck out of here don't fucks on my balls son what that's right did you say don't  fucks on my balls that's right all right i won't fucks on your balls all right all right good show

[03:29:30]  the moon is what is hanging there what is it made of cheese or what just hangs there like it's nothing  right but it's something and why the fuck there's some nights it's a lot bigger than other nights that's  fucked up because the moon's not moving that's a big fucking rock or is it moving or or relatively  speaking to earth or why didn't the same distance all the time maybe not i don't know i don't care  anyway they're telling us you got to go or why didn't or why didn't gary pick up our lunch bill  i don't know what he's saying like mysteries oh uh i think the uh insane clown posse is coming back in

[03:31:00]  to protect and you don't want to say the wrong thing about the wrong people you just speak your  mind exactly you know what i'm saying it's refreshing you just nailed it 100 you don't even have any  fucks to give we're fresh out of fucks man they're all gone you've been out of fucks for a long time  and that's yeah so when you're doing the show the show is on fuse wednesdays at 11 p.m and you're  basically we watched one of the videos today on the show and you're you guys are talking about music  videos but you don't watch music videos so most of the time you don't even know what you're watching 
[03:31:30]  we don't know if it's new or if it's something hidden or if it's 10 years old we don't have a clue  especially you don't say i don't go on the computer you know it's like a foreign alien to me i'm like  an 80 year old woman when it comes to computers really yeah so like you know there's really no  outlet to see videos nowadays you know so how do you how do you know do you just kind of follow  everybody else's lead that's around you with you know we got to put this on youtube we got to make  sure the website looks fresh like this i know the concept of it i just don't go on it myself you can 
[03:32:00]  tell people what to do right right right i understand what's going on there but have any have any of the  pop stars come back at you like has pharrell been like you know why you call me a hermaphrodite on tv man  because he can't deny he has a pretty face right why would you be mad if somebody says hey you got  a pretty face fella right especially when you're trying to look pretty he's too busy trying to figure  out how i knew he was a hermaphrodite that's yeah that asshole figured it out i'll be keeping this a  secret but nobody nobody's like come back you call you ray jeffson isn't like why you making fun of me 
[03:32:30]  guys no because she don't want none of this no yeah maybe she does i gotta tell you guys and i was  telling one before like the way you guys handle the criticism is my favorite thing about you because  i read the quote because gq they put out like this asshole thing of like the 25 worst rappers and of  course you know because you guys are all over the internet now and you guys are the new other thing  to hate at the moment they put you as number one that's right and i think shaggy's quote was my 
[03:33:00]  favorite way anybody's ever responded to negative criticism it was just simple he said tell gq to say it to  my face right you don't say nobody wants to do that right hey guys who suck no they'll write  about us so you ain't gonna look at them yeah yeah we were talking about the uh miracles video earlier  and i was when you put that out was the intention like we're gonna make this ridiculous no no the  intention was just like it is man heartfelt some of our music is heartfelt some of our music is is just 
[03:33:30]  like that call it corny if you will we've been making this we've been showing that side of us  for years right for from the beginning from our first album we have you know we've been showing  that side of us you know we've had songs like that you know um uh that was just the first time we ever  made a video for a song like that you know but sometimes we're speaking to the juggalos and when  we're speaking to juggalos it's not always so hard you know sometimes we're speaking to the world and 
[03:34:00]  that's when it's fast and ruthless and we got a lot to say but sometimes we're speaking to our  to our brothers and sisters in the juggalo family and that's what a song like miracles is you know  what i mean were you annoyed that it went viral no because you know because it didn't go happy  but it went viral it's like it was on every website like you got to see this this is ridiculous like  did that annoy you or you still don't understand why it was so ridiculous about it you don't say  right i i never understood why like people bugged off that shit so hard check this out when you okay 
[03:34:30]  check this out when you hate something yeah you know what i'm saying you just hate it you don't  sit there and stew over it and stare at it and write a blog about it and all kind of shit you just hate  it right like you're just sitting there like this isn't my ship moving on moving on but when something  affects you in such a strong way you don't know how to deal with it yeah that's what happened with  miracles that's why there was so much like opening criticism with huge people standing up and blogging 
[03:35:00]  and yeah sending a shit and going crazy over it it's because it touched them and they were embarrassed  the fact that it touched them you think so i think so i think i think it hit it it hit on sensitivities  in some way and they were they were so confused by that because they hate us yeah yeah affecting me  this is making my stomach feel butterfly yeah did i just think they just make me think they say  fuck you guys right for doing this to me you know and what i think is so funny too what's the line 
[03:35:30]  that caught the most flack from that song magnets how do they work fucking magnets you don't say it  everyone's so pissed off for that you don't say it's like all right you tell me right now how do  magnets work that's what i was gonna say because do you really know how you can look up how a magnet  works but who the fuck is reading books about magnets right it's uh opposite polarity of the  north pole it's like all right but how does that work yeah that's still crazy not to mention that line  was written because at the time you know what i mean i'm looking through the eyes of my four-year-old 
[03:36:00]  son right who who uh who uh doesn't know how magnets work and can't look up it look it up online you  know and he's playing with these magnets and he's playing with them he doesn't know what the hell's  going on you know what i mean and he's amazed by it and that's what i'm talking about that's a  miracle to him you know what i mean just because you grow up and it's not a miracle to you no more  it was a miracle to him then then at that time you see what i'm saying do you know when you write a  lyric that's going to stick with people like for me uh what is a juggalo he's not a phony he'll come 
[03:36:30]  in your house and bust a nut in your macaroni it's never left my head i heard that lyric when i was  like probably 17 years old and busting a nut in somebody's macaroni it's just a picture i can't  get i i could never it has never escaped my brain do you know when you're writing something like you  know uh eat up monopoly and shit out connect four that like this is something that's going to stick  with people i think i think i believe that uh everybody's different and and something affects 
[03:37:00]  everybody yeah when you're writing stuff you're hoping everything will stick with everybody you know  what i'm saying it's like it's just always different right sometimes some things you know  like that's the first time i've ever heard that line what one that line um quoted really yeah  oh my god all my career i've never heard anybody say i love that line bust it under your macaroni  yeah yeah wow i mean it's it's like i think there's something for everybody you know what i'm saying  some more than others some we hear about a lot you know of course miracles and shit yeah and then like 
[03:37:30]  you know slingshot your nuts up your butthole you know things like that it amazes me like the  one thing i love about you guys is just how much material you keep putting out and not only do you  keep putting out but it's still funny like what what's your writing process like how do you keep  doing that we wonder about that all the time especially with with uh our new new show out uh our  fuse it's like we were just talking about that yesterday it's like because we were talking about  like the episode from last week and like some of the silly on there and we're just like we don't 
[03:38:00]  even know where the that comes from you know what i'm saying it's like and it's amazing to us too  because like all of a sudden like you're doing another one and it's all new you're  thinking of just uh to you know what i'm saying to to school people you know what i'm saying it just  comes from a dying never-ending hunger you know to to to uh succeed and in the and make this thing work  you know those these people out there you guys they got their entire backs tattooed you know what 
[03:38:30]  i mean yeah it's like is that pressure for you guys like you guys know like your faces are tattooed  on these people's bodies forever keep it coming for them so they don't one day say what did i do this  for you know we want to do better for them and keep it coming and always keep them entertained you  know always feed them as if they're hungry always keep feeding them and feeding them and give them more  and more flavor and it's for the people who love us yeah yeah we have a lot of love it's not in the  numbers like it's not in the millions and millions of fans but the fans that love us love us so much 
[03:39:00]  for sure i'm saying that it might as well be millions and millions of fans well and that's what  i was saying like the people who love you guys like they only listen there a lot of people who just  listen to psychopathic records music and that's literally all they listen to our army of a hundred  thousand will defeat any army of a million right because they're passionate that's right and they're  super just super loyal and they're super passionate and they'll shoot you right in the kneecap right 
[03:39:30]  what what are the steps to suing the government because you said that's what you're going to do  like you are taking our we're not going to you're doing it in the process because they're taking your  fan base and they're turning them into criminals hire a lawyer who has no balls i mean who has a set of  balls right because i was going to say the other one would be effective some have no balls and are  extremely effective because their balls are tucked up their anus that's another idea that's another  thing completely hire uh hire a a lawyer whose balls are so big he sits on them and rides them in a 
[03:40:00]  wagon and that's it and then write him a check and go out your uncle's hands check as big as this table  and just hope it goes good right kiss every time we've ever made goodbye  i think eric is starstruck are you starstruck a little bit yeah he's a big guys too yeah yeah  i actually had a question about your merchandising because you guys put out all kinds of uh um just  amazing shit and a lot of this stuff ends up on ebay and and the prices for some of this stuff just go 
[03:40:30]  through the roof hundreds and thousands of dollars on some of these things but you have this weird knack of  putting out some stuff that is limited edition but people don't know it's limited edition until  it's already out like you put out the singles with the comic book for uh pendulum and then the different  album covers like the white malinko is worth a lot of money what is the most valuable most uh rare piece  of merchandise that you put out probably the original pressing of the the shaggy too dope um cover of the uh 
[03:41:00]  tunnel yeah ton of love uh maxi single yeah you don't see too many of those because that place  wouldn't print no more they're like no we're only doing this money we're never doing this  shit again it's a picture of shaggy sitting like this with his shirt open and his dick hanging out  and there's a chick hanging onto his dick right there they're like one pressing that's it we we  we can't do it because we'll get put out of business it's so funny because all we did was 
[03:41:30]  steal it out of a porn somewhere you know my head on it just photoshopped your head on it  yeah it's so fucking hilarious man when everybody still thinks that's really a picture of his dick  i'm just gonna be like all right just go ahead take a picture but you're probably like okay yeah  you can take it to my dick no problem right i'm just like whatever um i don't deny nor confirm it  when you when you brought tequila to the gathering like you had to know your fan base wasn't gonna 
[03:42:00]  like her did you realize no that we there was no setup that was no ill intentions whatsoever you  know what i'm saying we were doing a juggalette night revenge of the juggalettes okay that night  was called we had foxy brown lined up we had her we didn't know you know she was trying to bring  in like chick rappers she just put out a single called i want to fuck the dj right i mean it was  just pure ignorance on our part thinking that we had something cool that we're doing and we had no  idea that she was gonna happen you know yeah i ended up saving her life that night you know what 
[03:42:30]  i'm saying yeah she was in a trailer it was about to get lynched you know so i had to go out there and  help keep the crowd back to get in their car and go they were going after her trailer yeah straight up  what'd she do to get them so mad she was she was just titties out she was just you know she wouldn't  leave the stage she she could have just got booed off normally left everything would have been cool  she said i ain't no one of these bitches i ain't one of these bitches right she just started running  her fucking mouth like crazy you know what i'm saying that's when rocks started flying you know  what i'm saying yeah because you can't go in front of a crowd of people and be like you think you're 
[03:43:00]  tough i'm tougher and they're like what there's thousands of us right especially who are you talking  to especially when it's not your crowd right you know what i'm saying that's like me like going out  in front of uh i don't know in front of the google dolls crowd and be like well you know i ain't leaving  the stage and you know you're gonna like me no matter what motherfuckers and no other google  dolls crowd is sure killers well i might get like you know a round of low murmured booze in that  situation but you know just whispers to each other don't you wish he'd get off stage yeah i really 
[03:43:30]  wish he would plus how do you start a fight with people with your titties out anyway like that doesn't  seem like how do you start a fight when you're three feet tall yeah it was a weird thing they're  telling you uh you gotta get out i guess everybody uh you're in high demand now do you like that this  is kind of like because we were talking about this a few weeks ago the icp and everything it is is a  different thing now i feel like uh and you guys have embraced it that you guys figured out that you're  like okay if people are going to think we're jokes we'll tell them some jokes then like we can we have 
[03:44:00]  a sense of humor about ourselves let's capitalize on that we'll still make the music that we make uh do you  like that it's taking that direction i don't feel like there's been any real difference in in the  direction we're taking anything i mean um right we've been doing the same thing all along you know  but now you got like the fuse show and and and your videos going viral and all this you know a lot of  good stuff happening to us right out but we're still no most hated band in the world true that's not 
[03:44:30]  changed you know we did a song with jack white that was all amazing and fresh but then again why was  everybody tripping on it i couldn't believe that because i love jack white and so when i heard jack  white's doing something with the icp i was like that's amazing right but most people are like why  is jack white with those idiots that's what the real noise was about crazy you know but as much  respect as jack white gets you would think that people would be like okay i'll with this i'll try  it out i'll see obviously he sees something here let me take a look right but instead you know there's  many ways we're still the most hated man you know what i mean we get a lot of new love and that's 
[03:45:00]  cool but you know what's happening don't you we've been around so long that the people that we  started out with a lot of the young juggalos are growing up into positions of power now right you  know what i'm saying like you guys right like yeah that's your own show here you know what i mean you  guys listen to us right right that's because it's the younger generation moving in now into the positions  of power and they're like all the all the bump these guys i got respect for them all the all the teenagers 
[03:45:30]  that were like oh great malenko got banned i got to hear this album are now are now me doing radio  shows yeah yeah and and they don't hate or even if it's not them it's that i remember them from  whatever right and and it's right they're still around let me let me see what's going on i'll show  them some love fuck that you guys ain't that bad i used to i used to i got laid to their song right  right well you guys you got to go do the next show i guess troy and me are going to be at the
