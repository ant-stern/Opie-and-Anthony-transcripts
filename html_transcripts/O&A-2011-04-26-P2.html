<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" broadcast hosted by Sam Roberts and E-Rock opened with birthday wishes for Anthony Cumia and a discussion about E-Rock's perceived disproportionate share of on-air criticism from Opie and Anthony, which E-Rock attributed to his consistent presence on the show.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to Lady Gaga, analyzing her political statements and stage persona.  This segment included a played clip of Patrice O'Neill and Joe DeRosa (previous Opie and Anthony guests) delivering profane and highly critical commentary on a Lady Gaga political speech.

The hosts then investigated an alleged "bit" by Opie involving a car door slam during a phone call.  Reviewing the audio, they determined the sound wasn't a car door.  Next,  they played entries from a "most annoying 30 seconds" contest, highlighting one entry featuring repetitive use of intern David's name and a vulgar insult.

A lengthy segment followed, showcasing a clip of intern David discussing Judaism, demonstrating his limited knowledge on the subject. This led to a humorous exchange with the hosts and a phone call with a Rabbi who corrected David's misconceptions about Jewish practices and holidays.  The show concluded with discussion of Rob Cross's actions concerning Ron Bennington's absence and promotional announcements for upcoming broadcasts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is, After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts. Opie and Anthony are long gone.  They got out of here as quick as possible.  As a matter of fact, Anthony was getting very antsy  waiting to do that last live read.  He did not want to be here, but as soon as it was done,  both of them took off, ran down the hallway, 
[00:00:30]  and basically jumped out the window.  The rest of us are still here, as we always are, on the virus.  Today was a very special day.  As we talked about at the very end of the show,  it's Anthony's birthday today.  We tried to bring that up in the beginning of the show.  If you missed it, the replay's at 3 p.m. Eastern.  We tried to bring up at the beginning of the show  that it was Anthony's birthday,  and E-Rock, for some reason, that was a big mistake.  Yeah, tried to be nice, and of course, you know, it's my fault.  Do you think, because this is the second day this week, 
[00:01:00]  this week being Tuesday,  this is the second day this week that you've done something  that you've gotten completely scolded for,  do you think that they're harder on you, Opie and Anthony,  than they are on anybody else?  That's a very loaded question, Sam.  Well, do you?  I don't think I'm going to answer that one.  Why not?  I mean, do you think...  Because there's no right answer to that one.  Do you think you catch it worse than everybody else,  or do you think that your performance dictates 
[00:01:30]  the scolding that you get?  I think I catch it worse.  Oh.  Do you have any idea?  Worse than everybody, or worse than...  Because, I mean, some of us catch our lumps.  I catch my lumps from time to time.  Yeah, but yours is that you haven't shut up,  and they want to move on to the next subject,  but you're still making it about you.  What else do I do wrong?  Well, that's the big thing that you do wrong.  You're getting good at coming back at me with this stuff.  But do you think the other guys kind of get off the hook? 
[00:02:00]  I don't know what the other...  I'm not paying attention to them,  so if they got in trouble for something  that they did or didn't do,  then, you know, it is what it is.  I don't know.  How come you think they're harder on you, Opie and Anthony?  Because I'm the one right here in front of them all the time.  So you think whoever's sitting in that seat  is the one who would get it the hardest?  No, it's just if I'm in front of them,  then it's going to be me.  So it's just the combination of you being you  and you being right in front of them.  Yes.  It's a lethal, lethal dose of venom in the case of E-Rock. 
[00:02:30]  One of these days we'll get Opie back in here,  and I will ask him the question,  if he is harder on you than he is on everybody else.  Why? It doesn't matter.  Because I want an explanation.  I want to get to the bottom of it,  and I think...  Oh, see, this is the second thing that's wrong with you.  What?  Because then you start stirring shit for no reason.  Well, I think the people at home,  especially now after you've said it,  acknowledge...  I didn't say anything.  This is all yours.  No, no, no.  You said you get it harder.  You said you get... 
[00:03:00]  You brought this all up.  I asked you and you said you get it harder.  So, the people at home now would naturally want to know,  hey, how come E-Rock gets it so bad?  That's the answer I'm trying to find for people.  You understand.  Sure.  Well, E-Rock, it was a big day.  On top of it being Ant's birthday,  we spent some time talking about Lady Gaga, of course.  She has her HBO thing coming out soon,  and there's a clip of it that came out online 
[00:03:30]  where she's sitting, getting ready for her big concert,  Madison Square Garden,  and she's crying and saying that sometimes  she feels like a loser, too.  E-Rock, today was not the first time  that we've brought up Lady Gaga on this show,  Opie and Anthony.  I mean, this show is after Opie and Anthony Live,  but on Opie and Anthony,  it wasn't the first time her name's been brought up.  No, and it's never to praise her music  or her performance, either.  Well, honestly, whenever they bring up anything 
[00:04:00]  other than maybe Fios,  or, no, just Fios,  is it ever to praise it?  No.  No, just praise for Fios and nothing else.  Everything else is horrible.  But!  I'm thinking, there's got to be something else  that's been praised.  Something else that's been praised,  that gets praised regularly?  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  And Guinness.  And Guinness and Fios.  Alcohol and Fios gets praised.  Just coffee.  No, no, they get mad with the coffee.  Yeah, no, the coffee does not get praised.  Wow, this is a short list. 
[00:04:30]  So right now we have alcohol and Fios.  Yeah.  That's it, right?  Wow, I'm really stumped.  Yeah, I can't think of anything that they like.  Well, Gaga's been brought up many times  and picked apart and torn to shreds  and just completely dismantled.  One of everybody's favorite times  that I've spoken to anyway  was Obie was actually not here.  This was like a year or so ago.  Obie was not in studio,  but Ant was here 
[00:05:00]  along with Patrice and Joe DeRosa.  I forgot about this until you brought it up.  Yeah, I mean,  we haven't talked about it in a long time,  but when it first happened,  it was all we could talk about.  It was during the immigration thing  that was going on in Arizona  with people having to show their papers  and all this stuff.  Lady Gaga was on tour,  so she goes to Arizona  and gets up on stage  and talks about how this is bad  and gets all political.  Patrice's commentary on Lady Gaga  was some of the funniest Lady Gaga commentary 
[00:05:30]  that has ever been broadcast.  I am now prepared to share that commentary with you.  Now, this is a shortened version  because this went on for a while.  Yeah, I mean,  we can't play the full version  because we'd literally go into Ron and Fez time  even if we played it now.  But, and by the way,  in reference to what Obie was saying  just as the show ended about the door slamming,  E-Rock, do you think you will find it?  Yeah, I'm going to go look for that  as soon as this starts.  Okay, so after we do this,  we'll talk about whether or not 
[00:06:00]  we should have known that Obie slammed his door.  But in the meantime,  here it is,  Patrice O'Neill and Lady Gaga  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After O&A Live.  I want to hear her and her wisdom  on this Arizona immigration,  illegal immigration bill.  I didn't used to be brave.  I wasn't a brave person at all.  But you have made me brave. 
[00:06:30]  What?  What?  And now I'm going to be brave for you.  What is she babbling about?  Tonight,  I want you to free yourself.  I want you to let go of all of your insecurities.  I want you to reject any person or anything 
[00:07:00]  or any law that have ever made you feel  like you don't belong.  Show your big clit,  you dummy.  Shut up.  She's wearing a fucking hefty bag  and trying to be profound.  Does she have a big clit?  Oh, it's giant.  This is what's the size of a thumb.  This is for the spirit of all of you.  I dedicate this song.  This is for the love I have for all Mexicans. 
[00:07:30]  This fucking gun has never made a song  that had anything to do with anything.  No.  This song is for world peace.  I just want to send out something  for the dignity of all Mexican people. 
[00:08:00]  The heart and soul of all mankind.  Shut the fuck up.  That's not your thing.  Any people or any law  that looks down on a certain type of paper, 
[00:08:30]  this is for you.  Put your peace signs in the air.  Put them up.  Put them high up in the air.  Type in the air.  Higher.  Yes.  Everyone.  After me.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Da-da.  I had to talk about  the great people  that have ever lived.  Jesus Christ, 
[00:09:00]  John F. Kennedy,  Martin Luther King,  Malcolm X.  This is my way of carrying  on their message.  This is for you.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  We love you all.  Fuck up.  Just stick to your horse shit.  Exactly. 
[00:09:30]  Stick to your horse shit.  You know, fuck that world.  You had a fucking epiphany one day,  but won't write a song  that would dip her sails.  She won't write an actual  fucking peace song.  No.  She's going to sing that horse shit  and say it at the fucking,  this is,  I love people,  and then,  meh.  There have been so many great teachings  in the world.  The Bible,  the Koran, 
[00:10:00]  the Torah,  the Torah.  When people make other people  do things that they don't want to do.  This country was built for everyone,  right?  Woo.  This is for everyone who died  making this country what it is.  Don't you fear the tears? 
[00:10:30]  Fucking AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS is killing Africans  at an alarming rate.  It needs to be talked about.  This is for the little African children  dying of AIDS.  That's like,  the fuck with the guys  that make that song,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh, 
[00:11:00]  oh,  oh,  and we love  all the children.  Oh,  oh,  shut the fuck up.  This is for the immigrants  trying to get into Arizona.  What is love?  Baby,  don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me.  What is life? 
[00:11:30]  I like to say,  when I see a child  suffering from hunger,  it makes me think  of the Tarzan song.  Abbie Kelly just texted me.  I am fucking dying laughing  listening to this Gaga shit.  I love that. 
[00:12:00]  Fucking dumb laugh.  What's the actual song though?  Can we have the song?  I don't even know why I have it.  I don't even know why I know that shit.  I know it's a shitty song.  This is for the Mexicans  being persecuted.  I added a verse 
[00:12:30]  for you,  Mexico.  Hola.  Hola.  Gracias for your pain.  Mexicans,  you can't understand me.  But fuck it.  Just come along.  She has nothing to do  with politics.  Shut the fuck up.  Does this sound like  somebody that fucking  has pain?  No.  This is party song.  Fuck.  All right.  Well,  keep that cued up.  Keep that cued up.  We might need it.  We have another quote  here by Lady Gaga. 
[00:13:00]  She starts really  getting into it.  Oh,  well,  they were going bullshit  with our first little  quote there.  So why is she going to lay off?  Here's Lady Gaga.  And the nature  of the monster ball  is to actively protest  prejudice  and injustice  and the bullshit  that is put on our society  as a youth  because you're a superstar  no matter who you are  or where you come from  and you were born that way. 
[00:13:30]  Hit the music.  Yeah.  And now.  Shut the fuck up.  This is the song  of freedom.  Yeah.  Here she goes.  Everybody's going to be  fucking at the Arizona  Statehouse  with the song playing  in a fist in the air.  That's what fucking  slaves need.  We need a fucking  Lady Gaga.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  That'll finally get  everything in perspective  and everybody go,  yeah,  Lady Gaga is right.  I say rah,  rah,  rah,  rah,  rah,  rah.  I don't give a shit  if you're a famous musician  and have an opinion  about something.  It's like,  you can't be that  kind of famous.  It's just annoying.  She's the wrong  kind of famous.  Yeah,  it's like,  that's Bono's game.  That's Bono's whole thing.  He started doing it  right from the beginning.  Everything was political  about war  and fucking this and that.  She's fucking  rah,  rah, 
[00:14:30]  rah,  rah,  rah,  and then out of nowhere  and she pulls  this Mexican shit.  Give me a break.  Come on.  Ram and Noodle song.  Ram and Noodle.  Ram and Noodle.  Ram and Noodle.  Ram and Noodle love.  Chicken,  shrimp,  and raw.  Peace,  bruh,  bruh.  I stay at Ramada Inn.  Ramada Inn.  Too much sodium.  Celebrate Ramada.  Where's my bubble gum? 
[00:15:00]  I have a Ram pickup truck.  Tommy,  Tom,  Tom,  Tom.  Yum,  yum,  yum,  yum,  yum.  Oh.  Oh.  Ram,  ram,  ram and spin.  Oh.  After ONA,  it's live.  That's what it is  with Sam Roberts.  We're all still here.  That was Patrice.  Joe DeRosa was in studio  as well  in one of the funniest days  in the show history 
[00:15:30]  talking about Lady Gaga  and her political ways.  Now,  on today's show,  as it ended,  Opie had said that he had a problem  because yesterday on After Opie and Anthony Live,  we didn't end up playing any clips  just because...  It was the Sam Roberts show.  Well,  I mean,  I had guests the entire time.  Booking guests now.  I mean,  I guess you could say booking  or they just walked by.  We started with Opie,  who was still in studio. 
[00:16:00]  Then Kenny called in.  Then Opie and Kenny  stayed on the phone  the entire time Opie was driving home.  And then Norton came in  while Opie was on the phone.  And then Ron came in after that.  So it's like,  who am I going to interrupt  to play a clip?  Opie,  Kenny,  Jimmy,  Ron.  There's not a lot of people to interrupt.  So we didn't play any clips.  But what happened was  at one point,  Opie just wasn't on the phone anymore.  And we were like,  okay,  I guess he just must have disappeared. 
[00:16:30]  We thought in the studio here  that that was Opie's bit  that he had decided  to just kind of disappear  mid-conversation  so that when we get back to him,  he's not there anymore.  We figured that's where he was going.  And I mean,  E-Roc,  that doesn't seem terribly atypical,  does it?  No,  it seems like everybody's having  a good discussion  and so rather than chime in,  he'll just leave the phone there  and then when we actually go to him,  he's already gone.  He's gone already,  right.  So,  what happened,  then I get in today  at the end of the show 
[00:17:00]  and Opie has a bone to pick with me  because he said  I didn't do my job as a host  because I didn't pick up  on the fact that he did a bit  which was  he asked Jim a question  and then slammed the car door  as hard as he could.  Now,  the problem with that was  none of us,  Jim Norton,  myself,  E-Roc,  anybody who was in here,  I don't remember who else was in here,  there's a lot that goes on  during this hour  of transferring studios,  but nobody in here  heard any car door slam, 
[00:17:30]  so E-Roc,  were you able to find the clip?  Yeah,  I found the piece.  It's really hard  to hear the car door slam.  Okay,  well,  let's let the listeners  be the judge.  Did we do our job  correctly yesterday?  This is Opie on the phone  trying to slam the car door.  Jimmy,  have fun in L.A.  Thank you,  buddy,  and I will see you,  I'm taping Chelsea tomorrow,  it doesn't air tomorrow though,  it airs I think next week  and then Leno Wednesday  and back Thursday morning.  You're a busy guy.  Yeah,  he tried to, 
[00:18:00]  you know,  yes.  What are you doing for Leno?  It's a piece called  Jim and Jay give love advice,  love advice with Jim and Jay.  Oh.  Did you hear it?  No.  Where was it?  Let's play it again.  All right,  I'll shorten the clip  down a little bit  and see if you can  see if you can find it now.  Yeah,  he tried to,  you know,  yes.  What are you doing for Leno?  It's a,  it's a,  a piece called  Jim and Jay give love advice,  love advice with Jim and Jay.  Oh.  See,  I kind of heard something  that sounded like 
[00:18:30]  he might have,  like,  sniffed into the phone  or brushed his thumb  against the talking part  or something.  Well,  I'm guessing from the way  the,  the,  the wave looks on this thing,  it's when Jimmy went,  uh,  like that,  at the same time  when the car door slammed.  Okay,  play it again  and look at the wave  and listen to it  and you say  that was it  as soon as you think  Okay.  that we heard  the car door slam.  Okay.  What are you doing for Leno?  It's a,  it's a,  uh,  that was it.  What?  Right there.  That just sounded like 
[00:19:00]  he moved the phone.  When Jimmy said,  uh,  I'm guessing,  that's the only noise  I could hear on this  in the background,  so I'm guessing  that's where it is.  And we were just supposed  to like,  read his mind  that he had just  slammed the car door  that he couldn't have  possibly been asking Jim  what he was doing on Leno.  Well,  it's not that far-fetched.  I mean,  that's,  it's not,  I'm not saying it's far-fetched,  but it's also  insulting to assume.  You want to hear it  one last time?  Yeah,  because I want to hear,  I,  because if I made a mistake,  I would like to admit it  and learn from it.  Okay. 
[00:19:30]  It's right when Jimmy  starts going,  ah,  it was at the same time  that the door slammed.  Okay.  What are you doing  for Leno?  It's a,  it's a,  right there.  There's no way  anybody could possibly  have listened to that  and thought  that he had slammed  the car door.  I mean,  it also sounds like,  you know,  maybe wind was blowing  into the phone.  Exactly.  Or he breathed  into the phone.  It's a cell phone  and they're in a car  moving.  And I think for a while  it was on speaker  because I was hearing  both Kenny and Opie's  voices.  Yeah.  So it's like,  how could anybody 
[00:20:00]  have thought,  and nobody,  it's not like anybody  twittered in,  oh my God,  you just missed Opie  slamming the car door.  Nobody could have  thought that was  a car door.  You're going to  make him feel bad.  I don't want to  make him feel bad.  I'm not saying  he didn't do it well.  I'm saying that  he said it was my fault.  It's nobody's fault.  You just couldn't  hear it on the phone  but it's not my fault.  It is what it is,  Sam.  But it's not my fault  this time.  No,  I don't think  it's your fault.  And you would be  the first person.  I would love  to throw it at you  and say Sam fucked up 
[00:20:30]  but I don't think  you did.  It's just,  it's not my fault.  Um,  now,  we were talking  also on today's show  about the most  annoying 30 seconds.  By the way,  uh,  let's play a couple  of them that we  did play today  but just to revisit,  we're going to play  some more finalists  tomorrow.  We narrowed it down  to 19 finalists.  Uh,  I got an email  from home  uh,  that my dad said  that my dog  started barking  at the radio  when she heard  William Desmond's 
[00:21:00]  annoying 30 seconds.  so let's play  that real quick  just so that people  can re-familiarize  themselves.  All right,  yeah,  I mean,  you kind of get  the picture  of where it was going.  Wow.  Yeah, I think that is a real contender for Most Annoying 30 Seconds.  Somebody's going to win $2,000. 
[00:21:30]  The other one, and this one got eliminated.  This one was from Brandon Hathaway, and he used audio of intern David and Bobo.  This is a David and Bobo show.  This is a David and Bobo show.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo show.  Whoa, Bobo.  You, Bobo, what the fuck, you mother fucker?  Whoa, Bobo.  Whoa, Bobo.  Master.  Whoa, Bobo.  Master.  Whoa, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  Whoa, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo 
[00:22:00]  David probably had made a bigger impact in a shorter period of time  than anybody in show history has ever made. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  I mean, he was the best.  Including employees.  Exactly, including employees.  We were talking about him a little bit on the show  and about how he hasn't been back here, and he's very strange.  Well, during Passover, we wanted to air a bit of David  trying to explain Passover and other Jewish things.  See, he always wanted to talk about Judaism, but he didn't know much about it.  No.  Other than, remember, we did the hot wax body shots? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the candles that we bought to light and get the wax,  and he was so offended the next day because there's some kind of sacred Jewish candles.  He was very offended by that, but that's all he really knew.  We wanted to play this during Passover time.  We didn't get a chance, but since we brought up intern David today,  I figured we'd go back because, I mean, this thing is always good.  I have one more thing, too, with David, if you want, before we do that.  We could tie David into Lady Gaga if you want.  We'll see if we have time at the end.  Okay.  But this is intern David, the legend that was intern David, and here it is. 
[00:23:30]  After ONA Live.  You know, I don't understand my own faith, but I certainly don't understand yours.  Like, what if you're, like, a good Jew?  Like, you're living your life perfect.  Why would you have to, like, do all this crap?  Well, can't you be the one guy that says, look, I have nothing to atone for.  I've done nothing but the right thing my entire life.  I'm not partaking.  I'm going to have a coffee cake.  Right.  A coffee cake?  Whoa.  Whoa.  It's not kosher. 
[00:24:00]  Why don't you just eat?  Then you're not going to go to, like, Jewish hell, would you?  If you ate on that day?  Yeah, that's bad.  That's not...  That's also called Anthony's house.  David, answer my question, though.  What if you're a good Jew, and you feel like I have nothing to atone for, so I'm not going to fast.  Yeah, you're saying, what if there's one Jew that had not one sin the whole entire year?  Right.  Right.  Why do you have to go through the process?  Maybe they're going to repent for other people, and they're going to... 
[00:24:30]  It's a team sport kind of thing, then, you're saying.  I think so.  I've got to say, the older I get, organized religion just doesn't make sense to me.  There's a lot of wacky rules.  It's just a lot of stupid stuff.  Yeah.  Do you guys have any fun holidays that isn't based around suffering and remembering suffering?  We have fun holidays.  What's one of your fun ones?  Hanukkah is a fun holiday.  Hanukkah is...  You stole that from us.  But what's fun about spinning a little of the dreidel? 
[00:25:00]  Spinning a dreidel is fun.  Getting presents is fun.  Yeah, but you don't get...  You get...  Not like Christmas, right?  It's like one a day for...  You get...  Sometimes.  It's not me.  No?  You get a bunch of old ones?  Not in my family.  I just get presents all in one day.  Are you jealous of, like, Christmas trees?  No.  In the house?  No.  Come on, they look cool.  The lights, tinsel.  No, wait.  We have lights.  What?  We have trees, but we have lights.  We have a...  What?  Yeah, they got Hanukkah bushes.  A menorah.  And Hanukkah bushes.  Yeah, but that's...  There's no Hanukkah bush.  That was a rumor.  Wasn't that...  Isn't that an urban legend?  It is.  That's made up. 
[00:25:30]  But there's a menorah, which has the light.  A menorah, but that...  Yes, of course, it has the lights.  And that represents the oil that burned for a lot longer than...  Right.  The Jews thought the oil was only going to last for one day, but it was a miracle.  And it only ended up lasting for eight...  And it ended up lasting for eight days.  For eight days.  How is that a miracle?  Because they thought it was going to last for one day.  They didn't think they had enough oil for eight days.  You know, I had a miracle, too, because I checked my oil in my tank, and I was like,  there's no way this is going to last a week.  And it lasted...  And it lasted a week.  Where's your yarmulke?  And it was a miracle.  Where's your yarmulke? 
[00:26:00]  Because I had the heat on to heat my house, the high ceilings.  Oof.  Jeez.  Oy vey.  Oy vey.  But David, was that a miracle?  Or just a couple of people who did terrible mathematical calculations?  On oil consumption.  It was a miracle.  Maybe it was somebody who just...  Maybe there was actually 10 days of oil worth, but somebody did not know how to use  oil, so they burned it and only got eight days out of it because their calculations  were off.  They basically got ripped off.  Yeah, basically, Jimmy's saying that your religion is based on a guy that didn't know  how to do math right.  Yes.  How does that make you feel?  We're just that part of it.  I don't think so.  I don't think a lot of people knew how to do all those calculations back then. 
[00:26:30]  All right, all right, whatever.  I think a lot of Jewish guys...  How do I hate this guy?  I think a lot of Jewish people that I went to school with and stuff always seemed a little  envious of Christmas because, I don't know, the whole holiday spirit thing and the Christmas  tree, the decorations around the house, very Christmassy, and you guys just had like a  candelabra.  It just seemed like, wow, that's kind of...  I always felt bad.  There's no reason to feel bad.  Okay.  I heard that you guys saw us all having fun and there was really no actual holiday and 
[00:27:00]  you guys came up with some obscure thing to partake in the fun that us Catholics do.  No, that's not true.  I've heard that over and over again.  Well, there are some Jews that feel a little disappointed, you know, but it's all about  what...  It's all about remembering the oil.  Remembering the oil.  We remember baby Jesus.  Yes, you do.  And you remember oil.  Yep.  That's great.  It was a miracle because the Jews thought they were going to be in the dark for all this  time and they wouldn't be able to see. 
[00:27:30]  Is that all it was?  Is it like you'd be in the dark for a few days?  Yeah, because it was a big destruction.  It was the destruction of the temple and the destruction of the temple and they thought  that there was only enough oil left and it would be in the dark.  What about the next morning?  Yeah.  Because the Jews didn't live in Alaska.  They thought that the oil was going to die out and wasn't going to burn on it.  I got that.  I got that.  But why didn't...  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Why didn't the next morning when the light would come from the sun, why wouldn't you  be able to see that and work on the temple?  And then you blow out the candle or the lamp and then you save the oil. 
[00:28:00]  For when it gets dark again.  Yeah, what are you doing?  David.  That's a really good point.  But I love...  That's a really good point.  I love how...  It's totally making him lose his faith.  No, but I love how you're pointing out how ridiculous that story is.  But our story of...  That's a really good point.  The baby Jesus being born to a virgin mother is completely sane.  And then the little Jesus was born and then they brought the frankincense and myrrh and  all that fun stuff.  We celebrate baby Jesus and he celebrates oil. 
[00:28:30]  We had a little drummer boy too.  You don't have that, right?  No, we definitely don't.  You know, the little bastard had no gift to give so he gave a song.  He could have given him the drum.  That's right.  If you could really think about it.  The ox and lamb were tapping their feet, but they really weren't.  They were just stepping in their own feces and Mary's like, oh look, they're keeping  time.  No, they're not, Mary.  They're oxes and lambs.  They're not enjoying the little kid banging on his drum like Bobby Brady.  They're just kind of restlessly walking in a pen.  They want to escape. 
[00:29:00]  They want to get out.  Keeping time.  Ox and a lamb just kind of standing there stupidly.  Ox and lamb keeping time.  Get out of here.  The lamb is eyeing up that mint jelly and he knows he's in trouble.  Stinky metronome.  So, David, when you pray, can I ask you?  You pray, right?  You can ask.  Oh, thanks.  Thank you, David.  I appreciate that.  You're welcome.  It would all be done if it wasn't for my son, David.  Yes.  What do you, how do you start a prayer when you start to pray?  What do you say?  Oh, there's a lot of prayers.  It's all in Hebrew. 
[00:29:30]  Well, okay.  I'm asking you.  I don't know.  How would it do that?  I don't have my own specific prayers.  There's just like, there's a book that you read all the prayers from.  I just read what it says in the book.  Is that the Torah?  No, the Torah is different.  Oh, I have no idea.  The Torah, you read from the Torah, too, but Torah is actually what it says is the Bible.  Oh.  The Torah is the Old Testament, so word for word is the Bible.  What's the name of your God?  Just, uh...  Just God?  Yeah.  Like Jehovah, like that.  Oh, okay.  You know what Jehovah's Witness is? 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  That's what it is.  Jehovah.  That's our God.  So, Jehovah's your God.  How are you tied in with Jehovah's Witnesses?  We're not tied in.  I'm just saying, like, that's what it is.  That's what our God is.  See, we have God, but then we have Jesus.  Man.  No, it's great about...  We have two, like, big words.  Yeah, we only have one.  We have a president and a vice president.  We don't have that.  Just one.  No?  Just one head.  And the Holy Spirit was the Speaker of the House type of thing.  Yes, yeah.  We don't have that either.  Just one president, that's all.  That's it.  What's great about David, everybody that is Jewish is calling the show going, holy crap,  this guy's getting everything wrong. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I'm a rabbi.  David's wrong.  David is wrong.  And everyone, it drives them nuts out there.  David is wrong.  We get the rabbi on the phone.  I'm sure you would know.  Let's get Rabbi Jeff on the phone.  What exactly am I wrong about?  Everything, according to the listeners.  Rabbi Jeff, what do you got?  Hey, how are you doing?  I'm sorry, but David is desecrating my religion right now.  Desecrating your religion.  Okay, how?  First of all, Yom Kippur is to atone for the sins of the individual and the jury as a whole.  So, if you don't have any sins, you still pray. 
[00:31:00]  Because someone who didn't have sins, if they didn't want to pray, wouldn't actually be a righteous person.  But forget about that.  Hanukkah is not to remember the oil.  Hanukkah is to remember the Jews who were massacred by the Greeks.  They destroyed the Jewish temple.  And it was a thing then to light the Manoah every single day.  It's like a fresh bottle of oil.  And there was no oil left because all the oil was spilled out by the Greeks.  So, like the small token to remember it that we have, you know, to remember the miracle that God performed. 
[00:31:30]  Everything was destroyed.  But he made the bottle of oil last for eight days instead of one day.  Can I ask?  After ONA.  It's live.  Look, we don't have all the time in the world to talk about Judaism.  At some point, we have to let Ron and Fez on.  Unfortunately, E-Rock, can you confirm, is Rob Cross out there talking to Ron?  Uh, I don't.  Yeah, he is.  But I don't think Ron is willingly wanting to be in that conversation.  Well, what is Rob Cross doing taking my co-host?  I think he's loitering. 
[00:32:00]  I'm sure it's not an important conversation.  He was talking to Roland and Liam.  And then Liam made his escape.  But Roland was still there.  And now I think Ron got sucked in.  Doesn't he work here?  I guess.  I don't know what he does.  Well, I mean, if anybody missed the fact that Ron Bennington did not make an entrance on today's show,  you can place the blame squarely on Rob Cross because he decided, I guess, as program director,  that that was the decision to make.  However.  He's program director? 
[00:32:30]  That's what Ron always calls him.  I don't know.  However, the Ron and Fez show is coming up next.  So stay tuned.  Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live will be back tomorrow, of course.  And I think I'm going to be on Hits 1 this afternoon.  So after Ron and Fez.  Who are you filling in for?  Newman.  Human Newman.  So I think I'll be on there until 5, if I'm not mistaken.  So after Ron and Fez is off, you want to hear some girly music, switch over.  I'll be right there.  In the meantime, Ron and Fez is coming up next.  Goodbye, everybody. 
[00:33:00]  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the ONA show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony Live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
