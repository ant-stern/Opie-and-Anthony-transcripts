<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal and his mayoral campaign.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton expressed extreme contempt for Weiner and the woman involved, using highly offensive and misogynistic language to describe them, focusing heavily on the woman's physical appearance.  A caller from Philadelphia echoed their sentiments.  The hosts also discussed Weiner's continued campaign and his attempts to project a tough persona.

The show then shifted to a lengthy airing of a blow-out argument between Troy Kwan and Mark Zito, which had originally taken place on the Sam Roberts after-show.  This argument, punctuated by frequent interruptions and commentary from Opie, Anthony, and the other hosts, was replete with homophobic slurs, personal insults, and accusations regarding their work ethics and relationships. The argument apparently stemmed from Troy blowing kisses at Zito through a window.  The Insane Clown Posse's earlier guest appearance was briefly referenced in the context of the altercation.  The segment concluded with the hosts reiterating their disgust for Weiner and the woman involved, and speculating about her potential pornography career.

Following this, the show continued its discussion of the Troy and Mark Zito altercation, focusing on the use of homophobic slurs like "faggot."  Troy defended his use of the slur, claiming it was not intended as a homophobic attack but rather aggressive rhetoric used playfully amongst men, targeting masculinity.  Zito expressed feeling threatened, while Troy denied any malicious intent.  The discussion broadened to include comparisons with other racial and offensive slurs and the varying impacts of such language on different groups. Sam Roberts' attempts at mediation were unsuccessful. Ron and Fez also contributed to the discussion of the use of the slurs. The unresolved tension between Troy and Mark remained.

The conversation then shifted to a broader discussion of the use of homophobic slurs, with the hosts debating the intent behind such language and its potential for violence.  Fez, a gay member of the show's staff, expressed discomfort with the slur "faggot" but reassured the hosts that he did not feel personally threatened by Troy.  The discussion digressed into listener reactions, the hosts' own podcast, and upcoming guests, including Mike Baker, UFC owner Dana White, and Anna Gunn.

Mike Baker then joined the studio. He discussed his new Travel Channel show, "America Declassified," his recent move to Idaho, and touched upon the Bradley Manning/Edward Snowden cases, the Anthony Weiner scandal, and hypocrisy in politics.  The conversation also encompassed the challenges of working in the public eye and managing workplace conflicts. The discussion returned to Edward Snowden’s situation, his whereabouts, and future prospects.


The show then moved on to a discussion of the perceived lowering of standards for public figures, using Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer as prime examples. The hosts discussed the lack of serious consequences for such scandals, contrasting it with the past, mentioning other figures like Gary Hart, Ryan Braun, and Paula Deen to illustrate the varying impacts of scandals and the role of honesty (or its absence) in public perception.

UFC President Dana White joined the show, discussing various UFC fighters and upcoming fights, particularly the Anderson Silva vs. Chris Weidman fight. He also shared his personal experience with Meniere's disease and his treatment in Germany using his own blood, a procedure costing around $10,000,  and noting that other high-profile individuals had sought similar treatment, comparing this to the American healthcare system.

Following Dana White, actress Anna Gunn (Skyler White from *Breaking Bad*) joined the show.  The conversation centered on *Breaking Bad*'s popularity, viewer reactions to her character, the show's writing, and anecdotes from working with Bryan Cranston.  She also briefly touched on her past appearances on *Seinfeld*.


Finally, in a separate segment, Anna Gunn returned for a further interview. The discussion focused on the emotional experience of finishing *Breaking Bad* after five and a half seasons, including humorous anecdotes about filming and the cast's reactions.  Gunn discussed her future plans, including film and theatre projects, particularly a script described as a female version of Walter White. She talked about the show's high quality of writing and the difficulty in finding similar work. There was speculation about a cast reunion and potential spin-offs, along with lighthearted speculation about future projects.  The interview concluded with Gunn promoting her show’s premiere date (August 11th on AMC) and profuse thanks from the hosts.

[00:01:30]  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes!  Good morning, everybody.  There we go.  Yeah.  Open for business, as they say.  If we were a little fruit stand, we'd be open for business.  Maybe a hot dog stand.  Vegetable stand.  Ah, fruits.  Fruits and vegetables. 
[00:02:00]  Alright.  Wow, we've got a lot to do today.  We've got lots of guests.  But we've got to do our business before that.  Anthony Wiener's a creep.  His sex thing brought as a pig.  She's a fucking rat.  What else do you need to know?  A pig rat.  She's just a pig.  I don't know why...  She was on Howard Stern yesterday and good for him.  Yeah.  You know, he got a nice little exclusive there.  But I don't know why he fucking treats this broad with like kid gloves and was all in with her. 
[00:02:30]  She's a fucking pig.  She is a slob.  She's a slob.  I mean, the word slob-o was made for her.  Yeah.  And now she's in the paper going,  Well, I'm gonna make an x-rated movie about it now.  I'm gonna do a photo shoot outside Anthony Wiener's apartment.  Yeah.  She's a slob.  She really is.  And I wish Howard would have called her out.  And she fucking...  I heard her on the news this morning from the Howard show. 
[00:03:00]  It was a clip from the Howard show.  And she's saying shit like,  Oh, he wants to make it sound like he's got the perfect marriage.  Right.  You know, I know that he...  He's a little fucking rat bitch.  Little rat bitch.  You're a little rat bitch.  Right, man.  Fuck her.  And your little slimming dress doesn't help.  You're a pig.  She has a horrendous fucking body.  And she's a rat.  So horrendous.  She's a rat.  Fucking family of rats.  One of these pathetic broads that, you know, thinks now she's gonna be famous because of what she did. 
[00:03:30]  There's a million broads like this that have come and gone.  She'll have fame for a couple more weeks and then so long you'll be fucking sucking dick under a bridge somewhere.  Look in the fucking...  I wish Howard would have called her out.  Google it, you dummy.  She's fucking...  She's fucking a dime a dozen.  These bitches.  These whores that make the news.  Where's the Perkins waitress?  Remember her?  Yeah.  Not really.  What happened exactly?  Not really.  She's hateable.  She's hateable. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, I mean...  Well, Anthony Wiener's hateable too.  I'm not...  You know, I don't want to get too far away from what a fucking creep he is.  He's fucking not quitting though.  You know.  Oh, God.  According to the interview, he was coming like five times a day.  He was calling this broad like five times a day.  Nice.  You can't have a mayor that's coming five times a day.  Dehydrating himself.  Right.  Jesus.  He's coming.  He wouldn't be against the soda ban.  He would need as much soda as possible to rehydrate.  Ah.  Fuck.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  This world's crazy.  And then that fucking weirdo's on TV saying he's not dropping out of the campaign.  I don't know.  He's yelling at people.  I think that's the greatest thing ever because I want my entertainment.  Yep.  He was yelling.  I love it.  He was like, you know, a lot of New Yorkers wake up in the morning and they have tough  days, but they don't quit.  Right.  Like, are you really trying to equate jacking off?  Jacking off.  Jacking off.  Jacking off like that.  Ah, we all jack off.  Well, of course. 
[00:05:00]  But, uh, Mr. Mayor.  Right.  Shouldn't be, uh, it was just lying anyway.  That was the big thing.  Oh, of course.  It's more about the lying.  Lack of judgment, you know.  Well, he put out two things yesterday.  One was an official thing.  Uh-uh.  And then the other one, which we got as well, is him just yelling at people that he's not  quitting.  Just yelling.  His shirt sleeves.  He rolled up his shirt sleeves and was like, all right, I'm going to tell you the deal  now.  And then this pig is wandering around New York trying to get anyone to interview her. 
[00:05:30]  Take her picture.  Fucking.  Please don't take your clothes off anymore.  It was horrendous.  I want to see a porno of her.  I want to see that horrid body.  Really?  Just being slammed by some fucking Anthony Weiner look-alike porn guy.  But she's doing a fucking photo shoot at a beach thinking she looks good.  No!  With her big grandma bottoms.  That Frederica Bimmel body that she's got.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She should fucking, she should go rub some, rub some fucking sunscreen on her back and 
[00:06:00]  just go, oh, yes.  Exactly.  Yes.  Who fucking finds that hot?  Get the fuck out of here.  She might do a little extra cause she's such a fucking disaster.  Look at that bottom.  Get out of here.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's not a good swimsuit.  No, and then she's got back fat.  Yeah, look at the rolls.  That's popping through the horrendous tattoo that she's got on.  Come on. 
[00:06:30]  I fucking saw some, I fucking hate these guys on Twitter.  It's the white knight.  Saw a couple of them last night.  Cause I was on her Twitter and of course I fucking did something.  And then there's a guy that's like, you're beautiful and smart.  Yeah.  Just, you do what you think.  And I'm like, yeah, you white knight.  Shut up.  She ain't gonna fuck you.  Oh, those guys are the worst.  They gotta jump on.  They're the, she's my sister.  Don't hurt her.  She's my sister. 
[00:07:00]  They're not sister, but they treat her like she's my sister.  They want to treat him like they're, meanwhile, they just want to fuck them.  Of course they do.  Or they want it like, they want the girl to fall in love with them.  Right.  Shut up, you fucking dummy.  They are the scourge of Twitter.  Oh, good.  I hate this chick.  Yeah, she is fucking hateable.  For that, just because she, she can't, like, like the other girl was a hooker.  Like, Ashley DuPay was a hooker.  Yeah, right.  Spitzer fucked a hooker. 
[00:07:30]  So you kind of know what you're getting into when you fuck a prostitute.  Like, you're playing a different game.  But DuPray came in here thinking she was going to be this huge star.  Yeah.  After what happened.  Nothing.  She's, she's.  She's got a little gig at the post or whatever.  No one gives a fuck.  And no one's going to give a fuck about this pear shaped broad in another couple weeks.  Dude, I love when fatties wear that dress.  It's the dress where in the middle, there's white.  Right.  In the middle of the dress.  In the shape of a skinny girl. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  And then to the outside, it's black.  Like, you ain't seeing this.  Right.  Nothing to see here.  Right.  So, so.  It's fake lines.  It's fake lines.  It's like.  Well, the best part.  She's skinny.  Well, the best part is where they make believe their waist is up near their, like the middle  of their belly.  Ha ha ha.  So that makes them look slimming.  Yeah, it makes it look like their gut is hips.  Right.  What the fuck is that?  You can't do that.  It's hilarious.  It's like you painted a fake body on your dress.  Right. 
[00:08:30]  Ha ha ha.  Fuck.  Did anyone see her walking around yesterday?  No.  She must have came in right around the time we were leaving.  Yeah?  Cause I didn't see her.  She was there while you were here.  Yeah, she had.  Oh really?  She was on Howard's.  Howard was live.  I don't know.  I didn't see the broad.  She was here at like 8 o'clock I think.  Yeah.  No scuttlebutt around the hallway that she was here?  Was she hoping she could suck some dick around here?  Suck a little cock?  Was she hoping to suck some dick after the interview? 
[00:09:00]  I didn't talk to her so I can't deny it.  Right.  Did she take the secret Howie Vader?  No, because there was, you know, an extra in all those TV shows last night.  They were waiting out back.  There was the footage of her leaving the building.  Right.  Did the building's security dog lick her snatch when she came out?  You know the dog they use for sniff out bombs in the trucks downstairs?  Right.  Did the dog lick her snatch?  That would have been a good one for her. 
[00:09:30]  Extra!  And she's all over the place basically saying how much Anthony Weiner's a piece of shit.  And I was telling Anthony before the show, that means she's just accepting that she is a piece of shit.  She's like, yeah, I know I'm a piece of shit, but I gotta tell you about how much of a piece of shit he is.  She's buying the hype that's being, like, thrust upon her by her publicists now and everything like that.  Right.  What a great, you know, opportunity this is for her.  No!  What a beautiful girl she is, and you're doing interviews, you're hot, you gotta turn this into something.  You're gonna make this last, you get a career out. 
[00:10:00]  No.  You're a fuckin' rat, fink, pig that fuckin' did some sexting with some fuckin' second-rate politician.  Congrats.  Move along.  Let's go to Randy in Philly.  Hi, Randy.  Hey, what's goin' on, guys?  What's goin' on, brother?  Hey, man.  Not much.  Hey, man, I could not agree with you guys more.  That girl is a nasty whore.  I mean, after the pictures you see online, I did hear in an interview, she showed Howard 
[00:10:30]  Stern her tits.  Right.  He said, wow, they are some perfect tits.  I could not believe that.  How are they, like, show me a picture from the photo shoot, Sam Roberts, where we can  maybe get an idea of what her tits look like.  You can't really see, but, uh...  Oh, pancake nits.  Pancake nits.  Pancake nits.  Were they?  Oh, dude, they're nasty.  She's a nasty rat.  Like you said, Howard Stern's getting soft.  Look at her fuckin' bottoms.  I mean, I can't...  I don't wanna...  I don't wanna sound, uh, jealous, cause certainly we would've loved to have her on, but we would've 
[00:11:00]  handled her differently.  You know, good for Howard, but what the fuck?  You can't be on her side.  She's a fuckin' pig.  Yeah.  Yup.  I agree more, guys.  I agree more.  Yeah, she's a hateable person.  And her body parts are all out of proportion.  Right.  Like, maybe if she had bigger boobs, uh, to kinda balance out the bigger fuckin' ass.  She's getting them, she said.  Her manager said she's getting them.  No, those...  Those tits are horrendous.  Look at those.  She's frolicking. 
[00:11:30]  Her manager said she's getting 36.  They're horrendous.  Bigger tits, good for business.  Bigger tits, good for business.  Yeah, that's right.  It's good for business.  I like how...  I like how her bottoms are cut on that fuckin' thing.  Yeah, way up high.  Really, really nice.  Yeah, yeah.  But the leg holes don't even go high up on the hips a little bit.  Right.  And she's gotta cover up the belly button.  Yeah, it's up to her belly button.  I don't know about you, but I like a swimsuit where you can fuckin' see the belly button.  Exactly.  Yuck.  What a fuckin' pig.  She'd be a fun fuck though, that frump. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, shit.  She'd give you a...  She'd give you a good dumpy fuck.  Yeah, you would get a good dumpy fuck out of her.  I'm telling you get a good fuck out of her.  I said, you know, the disasters tend to give a little extra.  We're not...  We understand all that.  That would be good.  Just bend her over the bed and fuckin' watch that ass.  Watch the ripples of fat go frr, frr, frr.  You'd probably feel bad after, but she'd milk your dick.  It would be literally like there's a little farmer's hand in her vagina going...  She puts on a little straw hat. 
[00:12:30]  Milk your dick.  She would milk it.  She's horrendous.  Yeah, don't get me wrong.  I'd probably jab it in her.  Oh, God, in a second.  I hate her so much.  She's just this cunt rat.  She is.  This fuckin' cunt rat.  Cunt rat.  Anyway, Wiener had...  He made an official video yesterday.  Oh, he certainly did.  You know, sometimes people say to me, you know, you...  This campaign is pretty rough.  You may want to quit.  I know that they are...  With the music. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, God.  God bless America.  Who buys this shit?  There's good politicians and there's bad politicians.  And I don't mean like morally or ethically or work-wise.  I mean good at it.  Right.  And bad at it.  Right.  The ones that are good at it, you listen to them and you don't get the impression  that they're trying to fool you and fuck you over.  They are.  But you don't get that impression.  Sure.  Then there's the ones that put the dumb music and say the things that they think the American 
[00:13:30]  people want to hear.  Right.  And you know they have no sincerity.  They don't believe it.  But it's just done so badly.  It's like a hack.  It's like watching a hack comic and a good comic.  It's...  I can't...  I can't do it anymore.  Yeah, it's...  It's...  And I hate just about every...  No, I hate every politician.  Oh, they're the worst.  They're all full of shit in the end.  They're all full of shit.  Newspaper editors and other politicians that say, boy, I wish that guy Wiener would quit.  They don't know New York.  They certainly don't know me. 
[00:14:00]  Oh.  Quit isn't the way we roll in New York City.  We roll.  We fight through tough things.  We are a tough city.  We hear people all around New York City who get up in the morning.  You know, and that...  I was just talking about this with someone the other day.  We're a tough city.  I think every city in America is a tough fucking city.  Tough city.  Well, we're a special city.  New York City is special.  Hey, 9-11.  We're tougher than other places.  That's so stupid.  We fight through adversity here.  Yeah, exactly.  But every other city just... 
[00:14:30]  They just run naked through the streets and give up.  Right.  They lay down and let themselves get fucked in the ass.  Every city's tough.  It's a tough city.  It's all this horse shit that means nothing.  Yeah, we're New Yorkers.  We're a tough city.  Are we?  If I was running for mayor of Los Angeles, I'd have given up by now.  But Philly's not a tough city.  Philly, no.  Boston's not a tough city.  Cleveland.  Those places, what?  What happens there?  How about the D?  Detroit is a very tough city.  Detroit would kick New York's ass.  Oh. 
[00:15:00]  Crazy.  Are you kidding me?  Half of us would run away screaming if we saw Detroit coming our way.  Exactly.  We're a tough city.  I hate that shit.  We're a tough city.  And Wiener's just as tough.  I don't like the way he's trying to lump New York in with him being tough.  Yes.  That's just it.  New York being tough.  You know, New York doesn't quit, so I'm not gonna quit.  No.  They won't get a quit.  No one really quits, you idiot.  New York fucks fat girls.  We fuck fat girls here in New York.  Right, right.  That's what he should be saying.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  We talk dirty a year after we say we weren't here in New York.  Right, here in New York.  As New Yorkers.  We love a good pig.  We like a rat pig.  We love sticking a pig here in New York City.  After all, fat bottom girls make the world go round.  Yes.  That should have been it.  Fat bottom girls be playing in the background.  He's giving his rah-rah speech.  Look at that fucking fatty.  She's horrendous.  That dress goes way out, but the white lines like you were saying makes her look like she's... 
[00:16:00]  It's fake.  She's thin.  If she was standing in front of a black backdrop, she'd have a great body.  Yeah.  Fake dress.  Yeah.  You ain't fooling no one, piggy.  Let's get back to Wiener.  Oh, yeah.  New York's a tough city.  They're tough.  Um, quit isn't the way we roll in New York City.  Ugh.  We fight through tough things.  We are a tough city.  There are people all around New York City who get up in the morning with a pretty tough  day ahead of them and they don't quit. 
[00:16:30]  He gets up with a tough day.  His wife knows he's a pig.  That's tough right there.  A lot of guys have been caught cheating.  They don't quit.  They go to work.  Exactly.  This fucking guy.  The interpretation, though, is it's just blah, blah, blah.  Right.  Other people get up and they don't have tough days.  Tough days.  Tough day.  I don't know.  It's very tough.  But it's really not about the campaign and not about the candidates. 
[00:17:00]  And this isn't about me.  Oh.  This is about helping New Yorkers.  Yeah.  Because they understand this is about them.  Yeah.  And this campaign has reminded me of that again and again.  Yeah.  In all kinds of ways.  You know, if someone wants to come out with something embarrassing about you in your private  life, you got to talk about that for a little while.  But it's also reminded me that citizens, when they come up to you and they want to talk to you about  a situation on their block or at their child's school or something around their job site,  that that's what this campaign is all about. 
[00:17:30]  No, they don't.  And I'll never forget that.  No one, no.  No one's coming up to Anthony Weiner.  Those people have always been the weirdos.  Right.  Hey, uh, Mayor.  You know, I've got a pothole in front of my house and it's been there for four months.  You think you can take care of that for a few years?  Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor.  Right.  We need another crossing guard.  Right.  The school.  No one.  You know, the traffic light has been out for the last two weeks.  You think you can send a crew over?  I'll work on that one.  I'm not sexting pigs.  Right.  I'll get right on that.  Uh, it's, and no one's coming up to him and asking those questions. 
[00:18:00]  No one.  Because at this point we all know it's, it's, it's, it's, meet the new boss, same as the  old boss bullshit.  And they're asking him.  I'm quoting fucking rock lyrics today.  I like this.  They're asking him about fucking sexting shit.  No one really believes in a politician anymore, do they?  But now's a good time to ask for other shit.  If he's like giving you a different.  Oh, right.  Imagine that.  Hey, I got this thing.  Right on it.  Right on it.  Because I'm not sexting.  I got plenty of time.  He'd do anything.  You know, my refrigerator is not as cold.  I'm right on it.  He's helping you move. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Now swing it around.  I like how he says we, or like if they ask you about your, say me.  Right.  They ask me about my, no one's asking anyone else about their embarrassing person.  Right.  We all have things in our personal lives that we need to get over.  And even after, you know, you get caught, you continue doing it.  As you're doing photo shoots with your wife and your brand new son.  Right.  We've all done this.  Right.  We've all done this.  What? 
[00:19:00]  That's a rough one.  Who hasn't sent a cock picture to a pig?  Right.  Come on.  Wow.  Fantastic.  No one's really innocent, but this guy's a fucking creep.  And she's a pig.  That was his nice new reality show.  The creep and the pig.  The creep and the pig.  The creep and the pig.  That was his.  Also known as the Opie and Anthony show.  That was his commercial that he put together. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  Yeah.  And then we got him yelling.  Yeah.  That was him at.  And then speaking of yelling, then we got Troy yelling.  Oh my God.  And then we got Dana White coming in here, which is awesome.  Awesome.  We got a busy show.  That.  What did Troy.  Someone told me Troy.  Oh my God.  Jimmy.  It's not just a casual.  What happened?  I don't know.  We'll set it up all nice in about 10 minutes.  Yeah.  It was an exclusive on the Sam Roberts after show.  There was a blowout.  Oh, Troy and fucking Zito. 
[00:20:00]  Oh yeah.  We'll get into it.  We'll get there.  Don't worry.  Oh yeah.  It's going to take us at least a half hour.  Oh, stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  Where was Wiener when he was yelling?  Was that just some kind of like appearance?  Oh yeah.  A little presser thing.  There's a bunch of cameras there.  And you know, he, he, you know, had to show a little passion.  I think, I think, I think if you look at him, he's been very contrite. 
[00:20:30]  And, uh, ladies and gentlemen, I did this.  I need, and, uh, he's probably told, look, Anthony, you've owned it.  It's all right.  Now you've got to get out there and show that you're a fighter.  Who's telling him this?  Everyone's fucking leaving him.  I know.  Yeah.  Is that what he's saying in the mirror?  Yeah, he probably is.  Right.  So this time he went out there and raised his voice and shook his hand at people.  Hey, I'm this guy.  This would make sense if he didn't do it for a year after he had to resign. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  That's the problem that a lot of people have.  People threw him the fuck in.  Actual voters.  That's the problem they have.  They gave him another chance.  And they gave it to him.  That's great.  That's America.  That's New York.  Right.  And New York can get a second chance.  Because we're a tough city.  And we don't quit here in New York.  Right.  Other cities, they certainly do.  Yeah.  Wow.  He had a second chance.  They were going to let him slide, I think.  Holy fuck.  What was that?  What was that? 
[00:21:30]  That's great.  I don't know.  I just saw some fucking gun sight footage from what looked to be Afghanistan or something.  Black and white footage from above and taking down a whole group of people.  Furt.  Furt.  Anyway.  So here's Anthony Weiner last night.  Or yesterday afternoon, whatever.  At a certain point, you've got to say, look, I don't quit.  New Yorkers don't quit.  I'm not going to go into the corner and curl up because someone found out something embarrassing  about me.  You see what's going on here today?  If you become mayor of the city of New York, you've got to put up with this every single 
[00:22:00]  day.  People saying to you, you know what?  You did something we don't like.  Cameras in your face.  Change your mind.  Back down.  Quick.  That's not the kind of mayor I'm going to be.  Sir, I say to you with all due respect, if you don't like to vote for me, do not vote  for me.  What people?  He found supporters?  I know.  I'm like, what?  You heard like one bunch of guys just jacking off.  They're all jacking off.  We understand. 
[00:22:30]  Hey!  What?  Don't fuck him ever!  I like his yelling style.  He's right, though.  I like the fact that he's not quitting.  Oh, it's great.  But he's a lunatic.  We'll have him doing this right to the end, I guess.  We'll be able to kick him around for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  That's it on the wiener, I guess, huh?  Is that it?  Him and his fat pig.  Wiener and the pig.  Yeah, let's call it wiener and the pig.  That's even better. 
[00:23:00]  Wiener and the pig.  Wiener and the pig.  She's a horrible person.  What?  She's a horrible person?  Yeah.  She's terrible.  Well, yeah.  We said all that, Sam.  I'm reiterating.  Yeah.  She's...  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.  I happen to think this young lady is delightful.  Jesus, Jimmy.  You do you?  You like her?  Yes.  Oh, she's a wonderful girl.  I gather.  Jesus.  Ha ha. 
[00:23:30]  Good for her.  A little career in porno.  Yeah.  That'll be next.  I'd watch.  What was this?  Oh, so would I.  I want to see her getting fucked.  Tug my dick.  That fat ass.  Right?  Yeah.  So you're making her sound like she's a beauty queen.  No, she's just...  Oh, no.  She's just a regular girl, but there is something very sexy about the fact like a regular average  girl.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  I don't think she should get new tits.  She wants to drop 10 pounds or drop 10 pounds.  We don't need new tits.  I don't like...  I'm thinking new tits.  She wants to drop 10 pounds?  No, I'm saying.  Like whatever she, whatever, you know, she needs to do.  She needs to drop like 30.  Oh, she ain't that bad.  No.  She's bad.  No.  She...  I'd give her a good 10 pounds of spanking.  I've seen Clown Posse in studio for the first time.  I've got to...  Let me just say...  Right, right.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  So...  Nah, you know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  It's the same old story.  You know what I'm saying? 
[00:24:30]  So...  You know what I'm saying?  I didn't notice.  You said that a lot yesterday?  Oh.  Yeah, videos online.  Someone...  Oh, someone put it all together.  All the...  You know what I'm saying?  All the...  You know what I'm saying?  I didn't notice.  He said that a lot yesterday?  Not too much.  Oh, okay.  A few times, so then they're making it look like he said it a lot, I guess?  I think they're just doubling up some of the...  Oh.  Oh, alright.  They're like four or five times.  I listened to...  ICP ruled.  ICP on the after show.  We liked them yesterday.  I listened to them on the after show also.  Apparently they walked out and then walked right back in. 
[00:25:00]  I told Liam, you've got to bring them back.  To do the after show.  Yeah.  And...  Yeah, that was good.  And then all hell broke loose.  I thought the ICP was going to be the thing of the after show yesterday.  Oh.  See, you just never know.  People at this point forgot that you even had them on.  Absolutely.  Because there was a massive fight on the after show yesterday.  It sounded all nice.  I'm listening.  I'm driving home.  I'm like, oh, ICP.  That's cool.  Just blowing ICP.  Oh, yeah.  Talking about how awesome they were.  Oh, you fucking were just drooling. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And then you say, all right, take it easy.  They got to go.  And then I just heard a lot of yelling.  Yeah.  A lot of yelling back and forth.  A real live fight.  Like, fucking verbal fight.  What happened?  Well...  ICP leaves and then what happened?  What I didn't realize was...  Give us the visual.  What happened?  ICP are in the studio.  Right.  And what I didn't realize what was happening while they were in the studio was Mark Zito,  who Troy yesterday on your guys' show... 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Had made it very clear that he really didn't like him.  Right.  Was outside the window.  And I guess Troy was blowing him kisses through the window like prison style.  Ah.  And I guess Zito was flipping him off.  Ah.  And I didn't see any of it happening because I was looking at violent Jay and Shaggy too dope.  Who wouldn't?  So...  Got clown makeup on.  It's crazy.  I'm talking to Troy about the gathering because I thought, all right, you know, we got about  15 minutes left. 
[00:26:30]  We'll talk about the gathering.  We'll talk about...  Wait, wait.  Tito was never in this area.  So why was he outside the studio?  I think Liam told him...  That some shit was going down.  Troy had talked about him earlier in the show.  Oh.  And so then he came to the studio to just see what was up.  Because Zito doesn't shy away from being on the air.  And yeah, and Liam always likes to see a fight.  Does he really?  Oh, yeah, he does.  Oh, I didn't know Liam was a little instigator.  Oh, I like that.  Liam's great.  Yeah.  Liam don't play.  I didn't know that.  Oh, that little 1970s dress man.  You're gonna love Liam. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, and so before I even knew Zito was here, Troy starts yelling about him and saying,  let's see what this little pussy has to say.  And I'm going, what?  What pussy?  What?  I know.  And then Zito walks in and the whole thing just blows up.  And then it just got loud.  I was driving home.  I'm on the expressway.  My hand reaches a little volume.  Click, click, click, crank it up a little.  I, I kind of, I kind of shook my shoulders to get back in my seat and just smile. 
[00:27:30]  I'm like, oh, what a great drive home this is going to be.  This is what radio was made for.  This is entertainment.  This is what Marconi meant.  Exactly.  I was so happy to hear hatred on the, on the airways.  Just people fighting.  How did it start?  I, that was it.  I heard a ton of shit from listeners, like, who were all, a lot of feedback from listeners.  Yeah.  But I have never gotten as much feedback from anything that happened on the after show from 
[00:28:00]  people in this building.  Well, they don't even know what you're doing.  They barely know you're on the air.  I didn't think they did.  Yeah.  But everybody knew yesterday.  The first, of course, was a text from Anthony Cumia before the show was even over.  I did.  That just said, this fucking rules, exclamation, exclamation.  I was driving home.  I'm like, this fucking rules.  I was so happy driving home.  Well, let's, uh, let's get into it.  Let's, uh, play the tape.  Do I have it over here?  No, I have it.  Oh, I got the other part.  I got part two. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  Cause then, uh, Troy went on Ron and Fez because-  Oh boy.  Cause then, uh, then Fez felt unsafe or something.  I don't know.  Well-  We'll get into that part.  Let's get the first part over with.  Yeah.  This is a whole story that's-  It's gonna take a little time.  So, you tell me when to stop, but people were saying, like, how did it start before  this clip?  Uh-huh.  This clip is the start.  That's the start.  There is no-  And it's the same cloud that she'd already left.  Yeah.  But 30 seconds ago.  Okay. 
[00:29:00]  It went from zero to 150 in a second.  And what people didn't-  Nobody knows yet.  Uh-huh.  Was, Troy and me met a girl at the airport in Montreal.  Oh.  And we were talking to her or whatever.  What?  And we were telling her what we did and everything.  We were like, you gotta come up and check out the studio.  Whoa.  And just kick it.  You know?  Right.  And the girl shows up yesterday.  What?  And she showed up.  I don't know.  She must have thought she was in Bizarro World.  Because she walked into the studio.  And I'm sitting there talking to the insane clown posse. 
[00:29:30]  And then these two giant men in clown makeup leave the room.  And the next thing she knows, Troy and Zito are inches from each other.  Was she hot?  Yeah.  Wow.  Good thing she didn't come in earlier.  Looks like-  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Why do you fucking save all this shit for your show?  Well, she wasn't on the air.  She was coming in because, you know.  Hmm.  So you met a girl at the airport?  Is that cool with this?  Well, I handed the ball off to Troy at that point.  Oh. 
[00:30:00]  That's how good looking he is.  Like, he picks a chick off in another country in an airport and she shows up.  She shows up.  That's right.  Yeah, she did.  I need tattoos.  Wow.  And she's-  Troy is also not-  Troy's face on your face.  bye bitches.  I guarantee Troy thinks that girl's of pig too, by the way.  The Anthony Wiener.  Of course.  Oh, he'd fuck her though.  Yeah, yeah.  Troy's a gamer.  Oh yeah.  He'd fuck her. 
[00:30:30]  He's done some pigging in here.  He was there for a goof, or he would do it because it's a slow Tuesday night.  Yeah.  You know, he would just throw it away after he's done with it.  He didn't hold back whatsoever  with Zeta. There was no knowledge in his head  that there's this girl that we met in Montreal.  Who cares? Why would you hold back?  She's sitting here watching the whole thing.  She was in the studio watching. Wow.  Alright, so this is how it all  went down yesterday.  I want to see what this little fucking faggot has to say.  What do you got, fucking pussy, blowing me kisses?  Fuck you, pussy.  You got something fucking stupid to say to my face. 
[00:31:00]  You little fucking faggot.  You want to take a moment to rub some cream on your tattoos?  Yeah, sure. You want to do that? I don't want to come over here by you, pussy.  Look at that. Mark Zito just walked in the room.  You're something fucking stupid to my face. Well, I will, actually.  Because I think everything you said in the air today was fucking false.  Oh, really? You weren't laying down?  You weren't laying down? You have shitty work ethic?  You weren't fucking wearing the fucking stupid clothes?  Fuck you. I was working the show.  You wouldn't know. You were out on the fucking couch, sleeping like a fucking pussy.  Getting guests and helping Roland bring them in at times.  Was I not helping fucking Roland? Was I not helping everybody?  Was I not talking to the fucking crowd? 
[00:31:30]  Was I not getting shit from the host?  Why would I report back to management like your stupid fucking wife?  Why would I give a shit about any of that?  Because you...  Tell me that, Troy.  Because I will. Shut the fuck up, you little fucking fruity faggot.  Whoa, whoa.  I heard your girlfriend getting fucking pumped out by other dudes, too, while you're with her, too.  Heard that, too.  What was that about?  You want to go to that, Rosie?  What's that about, like, getting punked out by...  When Troy said that his girlfriend was getting pumped out by other dudes?  Pumped out.  Right.  I know most of the rumors that go on around here. 
[00:32:00]  It's the first I'd heard.  You've never heard that one.  I don't know what that was.  I don't know if I know his girl.  Is that the job?  No.  Oh, a different girl?  Yeah, Zito's girl?  Zito wasn't denying it.  Wait, what needs to be said, because it is a visual, because this could get maybe a little  ugly.  I don't know.  I don't know where this is going to fucking end up.  If the kid is fucking blowing kisses at you while you're in studio, you're going to lose  your fucking mind as a guy.  Who is blowing kisses at who?  Zito.  That needs to be said. 
[00:32:30]  I heard Troy was blowing kisses at Zito, and then Troy said Zito was blowing kisses.  I don't know exactly.  I didn't see anybody blowing kisses.  But I'm just saying that's where, obviously, a lot of this anger is coming from, from Troy.  And then if you're angry, you're going to go fucking all out, right?  That's what we do.  Yeah.  That's what people do.  It's on the air, so you know it's going to sound right.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  Let's hear it.  No place for hate.  You want to know that Rose Meade?  Yes.  I'll fuck you, motherfucker.  Please give me your information that you have.  What, that your girlfriend's getting pumped out by other dudes?  I don't know.  Oh, okay. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know.  I feel like you're making shit up and saying it, but you have nothing to back it up.  Oh, yeah, making shit up.  That's just what...  I mean, it's not a rule in our relationship that she can do that.  That's the rumor around this fucking...  That's the rumor around this place.  Oh, my God.  Your girlfriend's getting pumped the fuck out.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I haven't heard anything about your girlfriend being pumped.  What does that mean?  Sitting fucking closed every day, looking like a woman.  I think it means having sex.  Pumped out?  Yeah, like a...  Well, I'm...  Like a Siemens beat.  I certainly...  A Siemens beat.  I'm certainly going on a record.  I have no fucking idea what...  I don't even know who she is. 
[00:33:30]  Exactly, because I ain't getting involved with this shit.  I think I know who she is, and she was really...  She was very beautiful.  That's the same girl.  But I have no idea.  I've never heard any of those fucking rumors.  I don't know who it is.  I've never heard...  No.  Pumped out.  I never heard the rumors.  I don't know if they're true, but I will jack off thinking about it.  Jesus.  Get a hold of yourself.  Sometimes a good rumor can get you fucking going.  And I'm surprised at that point, Zito didn't take a swing. 
[00:34:00]  That's what I was saying.  Because if somebody's saying that your chick is being pumped out...  I would do something stupid.  You would think that would just get to the point where I got it now.  You know, to be a guy at some point and defend your chick, you got to take a swing.  Yeah, that's the one part I wouldn't have forgiven.  Yeah.  All right, keep going.  Let's hear where this goes.  What are you, dumbass?  Yeah, you look like shit.  You look like shit.  Show a little fucking pride, you fucking faggot.  Yeah, I'll wear a cartoon t-shirt.  Cartoon t-shirt? 
[00:34:30]  You look like this.  The cast and the cartoon t-shirt looks fucking great.  Oh, yeah, you look fucking great.  You got a fucking 13-year-old, barely-look-like-your-balls-dropped beard.  You have fucking shitty, stupid hair wearing a fucking stupid hat.  You're saying I have shitty, stupid hair.  Yeah, look at your fucking hair.  I understand it's a little...  It looks like it's bad for electricity.  What the fuck is that?  What the fuck are you?  You're a fucking failed radio fucking pussy.  You're fucking your mouth, you're trying to sing cool.  You've never been Anthony today.  You've never got your radio show, so you've got a stock management stick hoping that's  going to pay off for you.  Fuck you.  Oh, okay.  Whoa.  Wow.  You know that.  You know that.  You don't have your show.  Where's your fucking show? 
[00:35:00]  Where's your show?  I'm a production, dude.  Where's your show?  Are you a production?  Because it seems like I run your mouth a lot and not doing a lot of production.  Do you listen to the show?  No.  Okay.  Well, then you wouldn't know what I do.  There is production on the show.  Do you watch what I do?  No.  So stop saying I don't do work either.  I watch you making your own fucking Wikipedia page looking like a fucking faggot.  Everybody knows you, Major.  Yes, you did bullshit.  I really am.  Sitting there like a fucking faggot on your picture.  You look like you suck penises.  You really do, Mark.  You look like you fucking suck penises.  I would assume you're a faggot if I just saw you.  Well, we don't have to use that word.  You said the F word here. 
[00:35:30]  Well, I saw you sleeping.  I'm glad that...  That's not really a particularly good insult when you just look at somebody and make a  weird fucking dog mess.  Mark, you were sleeping like a fucking idiot on the job.  I wasn't sleeping.  Yes, you were.  I was never asleep.  Rowan has pictures of it.  Laying down.  I was laying down at like six o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  What are you so tired for?  Because it's six o'clock in the fucking morning.  Why are we all working?  Because that's when you normally work.  Oh, man.  You're there to work.  Pause.  That drives me fucking insane.  Yeah.  The guy goes all the way to Montreal and he thinks it's okay to actually lay down at six in the 
[00:36:00]  morning when our radio show starts at six.  But you hear, logically, he thinks that makes complete sense.  Yeah.  That's what I was telling you about yesterday.  The entitlement of these fucking people.  You lay down when you're in bed.  And then when you get out of bed and go to work, you don't lay down anymore.  No.  Regardless of what time it is.  Look.  If you're tired, you're tired.  But you can't fucking go, well, it's totally acceptable that I can lay down now because  I'm tired.  Yeah.  It's early.  I can nap a little.  Holy fuck.  That drives me insane. 
[00:36:30]  Well, we're New Yorkers and we have to work even if we're tired.  Right.  We're a tough city.  We're a tough city.  They sent the kid to Montreal.  I don't even know why he was there.  And now we're learning that he was so tuckered out that he had to lay down.  I think Anthony pulled an all-nighter both nights.  Oh.  Wasn't laying fucking down.  Close enough to it.  I would have loved to have gone to sleep.  Who doesn't want to fucking lay down half the time during these hours?  But you hear the logic?  He's throwing logic like, no, it's totally, you know. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  You'd think if...  Go back.  I want to hear that again so I can be pissed off all over again.  And you guys had picked up on the fact that he didn't serve a purpose.  He should go out of his way to serve a purpose and be like, you know what?  I'm going to...  Look, there are times we pump shit up for the show, obviously.  But I really don't know what his purpose was there.  Oh, man.  And I know how cheap this fucking company is where everyone had to buy their own stupid sandwiches.  Yeah, I think they'd...  So why wouldn't you go, all right, leave this guy home. 
[00:37:30]  He's not needed.  Take the intern and then get the staff fucking sandwiches.  Jackie would have been...  Not Sal.  Jackie would have been a joy to have around in Montreal.  I would have taken both Sidney and Jackie together.  Well, of course, if we could have taken both.  Yes, yes.  Hustling and bustling around Montreal.  Absolutely.  Confused like every late night Showtime movie.  The confused interns, we don't know where the spinach is.  However, she says it. 
[00:38:00]  Spinach.  Spinach.  She said spinach.  Yeah, she doesn't, though.  She doesn't.  They just get blueberries and look sexy.  The gals.  There's still 16% of the people, the potential voters, supporting Wiener.  There's still 16% out there.  Go on the subway and eventually you will see someone jacking off in a seat looking at chick.  That's who.  That's my man right there.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  Go ahead.  Back to the fight.  Will, Mark.  Will, I saw you sleeping.  I'm glad that.  It's not really a particularly good insult when you just look at somebody and make a weird  fucking dog.  Mark, you were sleeping like a fucking idiot on the job.  I wasn't asleep.  Yes, you were.  I was never asleep.  Rowan has pictures of it.  Laying down.  I was laying down at like 6 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  What are you so tired for?  Because it's 6 o'clock in the fucking morning.  Why are we all working?  Because that's when you normally work.  Okay.  And you're there to work.  What are you doing?  What are you there to do?  I was there to put up signs and check the audience in.  Was the audience in? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, Rowan did it.  No, no, we didn't.  I checked in the audience.  Well, the audience was checked in.  All 20 people of them.  I mean, did you have a good job holding a microphone?  Did you do a good job with that?  Did you make sure everyone could talk?  That was my job.  Yeah, well, you fucking killed it, and I killed it with the audience.  Everyone's doing great.  We're all great.  We're all killing it.  You're awesome.  I'm awesome.  Everyone's great.  You're not awesome.  You're a fucking faggot.  You're a pussy.  You're a little fucking faggot pussy.  That seems harsh.  So if I just call you a faggot with no, can I do that?  You can do whatever you want.  You're a faggot, Troy.  Yeah, that's what I think. 
[00:39:30]  I'm not PC.  A lot of people would not appreciate it in special interest groups.  But I'm glad we got to the bottom of this and we're all okay now.  I mean, I fucking hate it.  We're all both gay now.  I honestly do.  I love how I do the thing like, oh, I'm going to get in your face.  I'll talk like I'm going to be fucking afraid.  You're a little fucking twerp.  I'm not afraid of you, but you try to defeat it.  Did your balls drop out of your body?  Your balls drop out?  Get away from there.  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  Okay, you're right in each other's faces.  You're just acting like a psycho.  You're not going to do shit.  I'm not going to do shit.  We're in a fucking office.  I'm not going to look at upstairs.  Technically, it's a studio. 
[00:40:00]  You really want to go outside and fight?  Yes.  This is insane.  I will fight you right now.  Over what?  Just because you're a fucking dick, fucking faggot.  That's a hate crime.  You shouldn't fight him.  That actually is a hate crime.  Well, then I'll go.  If you hit somebody because you're a fucking faggot.  I'll fight you because you're a pussy.  You shouldn't fight him.  I don't know why.  You wouldn't want to do that.  You wouldn't want to do that.  You wouldn't want to do that.  No, Troy, because you're obviously...  Neither would I.  Because I will fucking annihilate you.  Because you're a fucking crazy psychopath.  I understand.  Exactly.  So you better watch what the fuck you say.  Well, you better not run your mouth about me.  I'll run my mouth about you whatever I fucking want.  I'll run my mouth about your girl getting pumped the fuck out. 
[00:40:30]  You don't know shit about that.  I don't know if that happened.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Where's the venom coming from?  He's trying to sound cool on the radio.  I know what he's trying to do.  I get it.  He's trying to...  He sounds very angry.  You have no idea how to sound cool on the fucking radio.  What happened to your show?  What happened to your show?  When it fucking disappeared?  Because nobody gave a fuck about it.  You got out of college.  I don't have a show, dude.  That's why you're sucking everybody's dick to try to get a show.  Where is it?  I don't...  Actually, my job has nothing to do with being on the radio anymore.  You don't want to be fucking Mr. Wizard on the fucking radio. 
[00:41:00]  Radio wizard?  What?  You're fucking...  You're on your own show.  Stop trying to act like you don't know what I'm talking about.  Dude, I mean, obviously, it's nice to have a radio show.  That would be good.  But if you're on the air, you suck.  You sucked on the air.  Sometimes stuff like this happens.  It's awesome.  Look.  Here's the thing.  No, there's no thing.  Yeah, there's no thing.  I don't know where your fucking hatred's coming from.  You're acting like a fucking moron just yelling at me because I understand you think I look  like an easy target in order to look cool in front of OB and Anthony.  God, look at me.  I'm going to get my phone.  Where does the hatred come from? 
[00:41:30]  I got tight shirts.  I'm fucking a bunch of girls.  Because I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because he was trying to fucking butt his nose in everybody's business on that trip,  trying to take back information.  Remember, Sam, you and I were talking, and he'd be like, what did you say?  What was that?  What were you saying?  You were sitting at the table.  Yeah, and you were like, what are you saying?  What is that?  But your implication is that we're giving back to management.  It's fucking insane.  Well, shit.  You suck management's dick.  Everybody says that.  Not literally.  Not literally.  No.  Well, then that means I'm not a dick-sucking faggot. 
[00:42:00]  Well, no, you suck dick.  Maybe not their dicks.  No, I don't.  You do.  You're a homosexual, bro.  I don't.  Well, I mean, whether that's here or there, you can't hate him for being a homosexual.  I don't hate him for being a little fucking slimy fucking worm.  That you could hate him for.  I'm not doing what I think so.  Anything slimy to you.  That's right.  I don't understand why this is coming from you.  I just saw you being slimy.  How did you see me being slimy, George?  I told you.  By asking you what you said?  Yeah.  That's not slimy, you fucking moron.  That's just not being able to hear.  That's not slimy, you fucking moron.  Meanwhile, your girlfriend's getting pumped the fuck out. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, you have no information on that.  You have no information.  Pause that in a second.  I love how...  I love his answer.  Zito's answer to that.  You have no information on that.  What are your sources?  Yes.  I neither confirm nor deny.  Well, he's kind of a nerd.  That is so fucking funny.  He's kind of a nerd with his comeback.  He's like, yeah, your girlfriend getting pumped out.  Hey, now show me the paperwork.  But to Zito's credit, he did not pussy out. 
[00:43:00]  No, he didn't.  No, no.  Not at all.  He kept it at the point it was at.  There was no escalation, yet he did not back down.  No, Zito, he definitely...  I would have to say, you know, he argued better than I thought he would.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, not knowing him that well.  Calling Troy a moron.  Well, it's not over yet.  He's got in.  But I'm just saying, like, listening to it, you don't feel like, wow, he's getting massacred.  You feel like Troy's talking more, but it sounds like...  He's hanging in there.  Yeah.  He is hanging in there. 
[00:43:30]  He's hanging in there.  Definitely.  In there.  Everybody laughs about you.  No one's fucking laughing about my girlfriend.  Behind your back.  You fucking goddamn idiot.  Behind your back.  Who said that?  Everybody.  Yeah, who said it?  No, no, no, no, big man.  Who said it?  Everybody's talking about everybody.  No, give me, give me, give me, yeah, come on, give me something.  Let me know who said it.  Let's get your fucking feet off, you fucking pussy-ass faggot.  Uh-oh, his feet are back on.  Oh, he's playing with his shoelaces.  Oh, he's pumped.  Don't rip his shoes.  I didn't rip him.  I just pulled him.  I gave him a fucking...  He most certainly did.  Just ripped him. 
[00:44:00]  No, I didn't.  Oh, if you broke it, you bought it.  Are you gonna make it pay for your shoes, Mark?  No.  He doesn't have the money.  Oh, shit.  You're fucking moneybags.  Moneybags.  Mark Zito.  Are we all good?  Don't stare at me like you're a tough guy.  I'm trying to be a tough guy.  We're talking, so I'm staring at you.  At least he's not backing down.  You look like a fucking fruit.  You look like your balls didn't drop.  It does.  That doesn't worry me too much.  At least he's not poisoning out.  Pusing out?  Zito.  Is he?  No, I said at least he's not. 
[00:44:30]  It seems like he's standing up to you.  That's fine.  I said everything I had to say.  I don't like you.  I don't have to like you.  End of the story.  That's good, and I think you're a fucking asshole, so I guess we'll just carry on with our lives now.  Good.  Great.  It's very strange that this all popped up without...  There doesn't seem to be a direct catalyst.  No, he just decided this.  Did you catch a direct catalyst, Jackie?  No, he just kind of came in.  Yeah.  And didn't know.  Because he's sitting out there, and I'm fucking blowing him kisses.  You blew him kisses?  Yeah.  Because somebody's like, Troy, I was talking a bunch of shit about you today, and I was like, oh, interesting.  So I wanted to, you know, you didn't say it to my face, so I wanted to come in and tell you to fuck yourself to your face. 
[00:45:00]  And he's so hungry for airtime.  He is?  Why?  Of course he's going to stand in here.  Because he thinks he's the next fucking radio god.  I don't think I've...  I've actually never commuted anything.  Are you applying for Kid Craddock's job?  Because if so, it's in bad taste to do it this soon.  I understand.  You're really good at mocking my actions, Troy.  You are.  You're a fucking winner.  Yeah, so are you.  Mars, you've never, ever helped technically on the after show before.  What on earth are you doing in here? 
[00:45:30]  Went across a few technical issues back here.  I need to take a look at it.  He's just screwing mic stands together as Zito and Troy stare off.  That's kind of gay.  You're doing, like, some gay things.  I mean, we're just fine.  I know, I know.  He's sticking his tongue out.  I just want to do my blowing kisses and show him your crotch.  I'll show you what it's like to be fucking gay.  You will?  Oh, yeah.  You're going to fuck me?  Would you?  That seems weird.  That seems kind of...  I'm just saying, if you want to fuck me, that seems...  You would?  Oh, it's like, deliverance?  You're going to prove to me that I'm gay by fucking me.  I'm going to prove to you what a little fucking woman you are. 
[00:46:00]  I need to be fucked like a woman.  I'm going to prove to you that you're a little woman.  Shut up!  You want to prove to you that you're a little fucking woman?  You want to fuck me?  That's what you said, though.  You want to fuck me?  Not as romantic.  More like a prison scenario.  No romance.  Like a prison scenario?  No romance.  Okay.  No romance.  Okay.  You're a little fucking fruit.  Like you're trading for a pack of cigarettes?  You're a little fucking faggot.  You better hope I don't run out into you outside of this place.  Oh, boy.  So, this is insane.  Okay.  I just don't understand why you decided to get so angry today and then when I came in  to say it to your face. 
[00:46:30]  I'll say it to your face.  I'll say it to your face here.  I'll say it to your face down there.  I'll say it to your face everywhere.  At your fucking apartment.  What do you think of that?  Okay.  Okay.  You know where I live.  I do know where you live, as a matter of fact.  To a mouse.  I know it.  I know exactly where you live.  Oh, this is threatening.  And you want me to be waiting for you by your fucking apartment?  Fucking go for it.  Don't go.  You shouldn't go to his house because that's like stalking.  You can get charged.  I know where he fucking lives.  Sam, the voice of reason.  I can't go to his house just because you know if he wants to fucking push me in that  direction and let's see how fucking tough he is when we're outside the building.  You can't beat Troy in a physical.  No, fuck no. 
[00:47:00]  I can't either.  Of course not.  Okay.  That's insane to think such a thing.  Well, I'm glad that's on me.  He's significantly larger than me.  I'm glad that's on.  Plus, he's...  But I don't like his, like, intimidation tactics.  He's got a little crazy in him.  Oh, definitely.  Not that that's a bad thing, buddy.  You know me and you are bros.  Don't look at me like you want to fight me.  I see some anger coming over here.  And I'm saying today's ICP day.  It's all about love.  Whoop, whoop.  But then Zito came in and it turned south very, very quickly.  I didn't even know he was out there.  You just started getting very upset.  And I go, why is Troy screaming? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, it's fine.  I'm good.  Are we back on...  You two of you guys are back on good terms then?  No.  No.  No.  Good terms.  From you either, Zito?  No.  No.  Did this come as a surprise to you after Montreal?  No.  I mean, I never thought we were close.  Were you picking up on these vibes there?  Or maybe not to this extent?  Not to this extent.  Yes.  But, like...  See, the second I thought you were a snake in the grass, that's when I just...  I thought we're not cool.  Okay.  But, like, I don't understand why you would think that.  I told you that.  I get it, but what I'm saying is I don't understand...  You're digging too hard for little information that you know you can take back to the bosses 
[00:48:00]  and present as fucking...  What would I be...  Hey, hey, bosses.  Troy likes to fuck a lot of girls.  That's weird.  Like, what the fuck is...  I don't think I have a lot of girls.  What I...  We have to...  Wow.  From what you said...  Well, lots of girls like to fuck my girl.  Is that true?  I don't know.  I still don't know.  Lots of girls like to fuck my girl.  Yeah, you have to...  We have to actually make room for Ron and Fez.  But I'm going to do the responsible thing as a professional broadcaster and have you guys  leave the room separately.  So...  That's necessary.  I do.  I'm not going to be...  I do see how to run. 
[00:48:30]  ...responsible.  Do you have a live read or no?  No, I do not have a live read.  Would you like to leave first or, Troy, what do you...  I can't have you guys in the room at the same time and then sign off.  This is Troy's home base, so I will leave first.  Very classy.  Thank you for stopping by, Mark Zito.  Always a pleasure.  It's a good time.  Yeah.  Oh, you bet it was.  Sorry.  Don't start this thing again, Troy.  We're on a great, great positive note.  Liam, things didn't go well.  Things did not go well.  Fuck you, Troy.  Oh, he snuck in one. 
[00:49:00]  Troy?  Yeah.  Always a good time with you, buddy.  It's always been fun.  It is all in good fun.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  That sounded like good fun.  Jesus.  Wow.  How funny would it be if that whole thing, E-Rock, got fired because he chimed in with  a live read?  Yes.  And he thought he was hurting sponsors.  Wow.  That fight got very serious and very silly as well.  Man.  It's like a dumb schoolyard argument.  Like, two guys just fucking, you know, my dick's bigger. 
[00:49:30]  The best part of that whole thing was Troy Kwan saying that he would fuck Mark Zito.  Right.  I don't think he really would.  No.  I don't know.  I think he might.  I think he might.  I think he might.  Just to show him.  Troy's in his own little world.  I think he just might.  Depending on his mental state.  Yes.  At a given moment.  What are the comments saying on this video?  Let's see.  What are the people saying?  What's the top comments?  Why'd you go past that? 
[00:50:00]  Holy shit.  Why did this happen?  It's in the description.  I'm going to miss Troy Kwan.  Rockstar is hiring.  Rockstar.  How about...  I'm not going to read that one.  Why?  Oh.  Okay.  Let's see.  Look at the puppy on Fox and Friends.  They don't want to leave during this.  It was after our show.  It was after our show, you fucking idiot.  What is this?  An attempt to see how many douchebags you can squeeze into one room?  Who do we have? 
[00:50:30]  Sam.  Sam Roberts.  Just one douchebag.  And then we got Sam.  I would say Mark Cedar's a douchebag.  Sam.  So then...  Troy has a tendency to be a douchebag sometimes.  He had my favorite...  Mark had my favorite line, though.  What am I going to tell Matt?  It's been Troy likes to fuck a lot of girls.  That made me laugh.  That was a good one.  I think he was useless in Montreal, but he certainly held his own in that fight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then it's continued on.  Ron and Fez, I guess.  Oh, boy. 
[00:51:00]  Did it?  Oh, boy.  Did it ever.  Fez wasn't happy about it.  Fez was not happy.  Why?  No.  Oh, probably.  Okay.  Oh.  He went on the air and said he didn't feel safe.  Well.  Why?  I don't think...  That's silly.  Troy's going to...  In the end, that's silly, right?  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, you could say what you want.  I mean, obviously, people would be offended by what Troy was saying.  But, you know...  To feel not safe. 
[00:51:30]  Well, let's hear how it went down.  I felt bad for every gay person in the building today.  The people at OutQ.  Seth Redesky's here to do his show today.  Hey, let's not out people.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Fucking Ronnie.  That's why he's the best.  That's so goddamn funny.  Hey, let's not out people.  So fucking quick.  Fucking Ron.  He's outing people.  Oh, he's the best. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, God.  Why is he taking...  I felt bad for every gay person in the building today.  The people at OutQ.  Seth Redesky's here to do his show today.  Hey, let's not out people.  I don't think his family knows.  All right.  Troy wants to come in.  Yeah.  That's what I heard from the booth.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Troy's more than welcome to come in.  I think it would be very, very tough to see if he would keep his job. 
[00:52:30]  I absolutely agree.  But for some reason, it's okay to throw this word around 50 times.  Here comes Troy.  Fez.  Jesus.  Who's that you're wearing on your shirt there?  It's the guy from Major Lazer.  They're a band with Diplo.  I don't know exactly what his name is.  So, we heard that you had a fight with Zito today.  Yes.  And some of the things that you said made Fenzes feel offended and less than safe around you. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  He should feel absolutely safe.  I have nothing but love for Fez.  So, there's nothing he has to be concerned about.  I have nothing against him or his sexual preferences.  This has nothing to do with him whatsoever.  Fair enough, Fez.  Why do you, I just, I have to, I try to get a grip on this word all the time.  Why, hold on.  What?  Look, I love Fez.  But Fez, like, you know the context in which that word is being said is in just two guys 
[00:53:30]  arguing in a schoolyard way and being insulting.  Because a minute later he goes, I hear your girlfriend's banging.  Literally what Troy said is, I hear your mother's a whore.  Right, right.  That's the equivalent of that, and you know, especially since Mark Zito is not known to  be a homosexual at all.  Yeah.  No one thinks Mark is a homosexual in the real sense.  Troy doesn't think that.  And Troy doesn't have any history of any violence towards gay people. 
[00:54:00]  Troy's admitted that he's fucking done a few things that might be considered to put his  asshole on a man's nose.  If you want to see how Troy feels about gay people, the gay off.  Oh, God, no, we burn those tapes.  He's a fucking cock-swinging ringleader and not even a smidge homophobic.  So in that context, that's just two guys arguing.  And yeah, faggot has become unpopular because in a politically correct world, it's seen as  this terrible word now.  And it's not a nice word, but it's not like fucking, it's not being used against a homosexual 
[00:54:30]  in the context of a hateful argument.  And everybody listening knows that.  Yeah.  So come on, Fezzy, you know better than that.  Like, you know the difference between him doing that and then him going, hey, you're  gay, Fez?  You're a fat?  Like, there's a big difference.  And Fezzy's been around this world for a very long time.  And he's been around Troy.  He should understand this.  He's been around Troy.  Like, you came out and everybody loves you for coming out.  Nobody is.  He knows Troy.  Yeah.  I get a grip on this word all the time.  Why do you have to do that?  But I just, I don't know why it's so offensive at this point to just throw that word out there 
[00:55:00]  when it's not, I mean, if it was, if I was directing it to you, I can understand that.  I can understand that.  And it just, it's a way that guys hit hard when, when in a verbal fight with somebody  and you want to question a heterosexual man's sexuality.  That's where you go.  That's what we've done as kids.  That's the way it goes.  But do you think, I mean, all right, I, I understand stupid, not knowing any better 
[00:55:30]  kids, but as adults, should we be doing that?  But I mean, at what point it's like, you're going to censor.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  Would it have the same meaning if like, you know, you're having a fight with a gay guy  and you start screaming, you're straight, you're straight.  Why don't you go fuck a vagina?  You're straight.  Yeah.  So maybe, I mean, Fez has a point slightly, but I mean, you got to understand the whole  picture though. 
[00:56:00]  I mean, God, you really do.  And, and, and really the only argument that gay guys have ever had about using the word  faggot is, um, the violence.  They say it just leads to, you know, gay people being bashed, being beat up.  So you got to look at it in context and at what level it is.  You don't go from walking around being completely accepting and, and, uh, inclusive with gay 
[00:56:30]  people.  And then the second you say faggot, it turns into, you might as well be punching gay people  in the face.  It doesn't, it, there, there are levels of it, of, of, of what you're saying and talking  about.  The only thing I would add is like, we don't have the experience to fully understand what  that word means to a tree house one, a gay person.  Yeah.  Some of us might've, uh, done a few things that could at least, uh, some of us may have  driven into the neighborhood. 
[00:57:00]  What you're saying makes sense logically, but you do have to add like, you know, we don't  know, you know, exactly how, how that word could be hurtful to a gay person.  But I just think it's another way to have a little power base over, over people.  I kind of agree with you.  I think it's like everyone wants to be part of a group that has something exclusive.  Jesus.  The difference between like that, like the word nigger when you're a kid has always  meant something racist and awful.  Like it's always been that same.  It's a horrible slur for a black person and you know what, but when you, when you're a 
[00:57:30]  kid and you're yelling, you faggot, or you're even, you're a teenager, you, it's like  you dickhead, you jerk off, you like when you say this and when you cock sucker, I don't  think that you really put dick, like you're a dick sucking fat, you're just, you're just  being schoolyard assholes to each other and everybody, there's a big difference between  that and saying that to a guy like Fez who you now know is gay.  There's a huge difference in intent.  But the gay person would say, why is that a bad thing to be a dick sucker?  Yeah.  That's, that's, I'm trying to, trying to see it Fez's way a little bit. 
[00:58:00]  Sure.  But, and the response to that, why is that a bad thing that you have to go that low with  your, you know, your verbal argument?  It's all relative.  It's all relative.  I would say, that's what I would say to a gay guy.  It's like, it's all relative.  Like however you insult somebody, like if you say, Hey, your girlfriend's fucking other  people.  Hey, if they're a swinger couple, that's not an insult.  Right.  If they're not a swinger couple, that's a tremendous insult.  So it's all context.  There you go.  If he yelled at about my girlfriend, I'd probably jerk off and say, tell me exactly what you're  talking about, but as adults, should we be doing that? 
[00:58:30]  But I mean, at what point it's like, you're going to censor everything that you have to  say.  I mean, it's just like, if you're in a verbal fight with somebody, it's like, here's why  Fez is offended.  Not only did you throw that out there, but you said you look like someone who puts penises  in his mouth.  You look like that.  You know, you're specifically saying that what Fez, his sexual orientation is lower than acceptable  for the way a man should be.  I don't think that.  I mean, if Mark Zito is gay, he's just going to be like, yeah. 
[00:59:00]  No, I mean, Ron's sort of making the same point.  And I'm glad Troy's going to defend exactly what he meant by going that way.  And Troy actually touched on it before.  When we're insulting a guy, a heterosexual guy, and you question his masculinity and his  heterosexuality, that's an insult.  I'm sorry to gay people, but that's always going to be an insult to a straight guy is  to question his sexuality. 
[00:59:30]  It's, that's the way to, and you, that will never change.  I'm sorry.  It will never change.  That will always be a great insult to a straight guy.  It just is.  I agree.  Yeah.  Back to my ex.  If Mark Zito is gay, you should just own it and be like, yeah, I put penises in my mouth.  You know that he has a girlfriend.  Own it.  Own it.  But this is the funny part about where we are today, like as a country or as a whatever.  Like, they have this really nasty argument. 
[01:00:00]  Was Mark doing the work he should have been doing?  Was Troy out of life?  This whole argument between two guys.  And now the whole thing is just about the word faggot.  Right.  And not about what was actually happening between these two guys.  Because the word faggot had really nothing to do with what their issue was.  Their issue had nothing to do with sexuality.  It was just the two guys that don't like each other.  I'm bothered by Zito's work ethic.  That's all I care about.  Because I know how cheap they are around here.  They wasted money on his fucking trip to Montreal, period.  When the interns could have gone.  Whoa, hey. 
[01:00:30]  Some things have been changed around here.  A little bit.  I don't see the phone and keyboards.  All right, we're getting somewhere.  And I'm bothered that Troy is picking up ass in the Montreal airport.  And I can't do it after a fucking gala.  And she's fucking.  After we had a whole bit about it.  And she shows up.  She shows up days later.  Then she shows up.  It's amazing to me.  Own it and be like, yeah, I put penises in my mouth.  You know that he has a girlfriend.  That's why you said stuff about his girlfriend being with other people.  Right.  You never kept anything in an air of truthfulness at any point of this entire thing. 
[01:01:00]  Correct.  You yelled out things that you thought were the lowest things that could happen.  Your girlfriend's a slut.  You yourself are with other men.  Right.  I mean, when I get into a verbal fight, I go for the throat.  But why didn't you drop the N-bomb like that?  Do you think who kid or somebody else might have been offended if you said you act like the N-word?  Do you think people in shade 45 would be like, oh, that's just what happens when the guys argue with each other? 
[01:01:30]  Well, I mean, first of all, I wouldn't say the N-word.  People are scared to say that word over the F-word.  But no one has most...  Sorry.  That's not a common thing in an argument.  Like, you've never argued with your buddies, white guys, and said, you nigger.  Like, that's not...  That would be so out of context.  Like, what the fuck?  Like, no one could say, yeah, I've heard that a million times in arguments between my friends.  Right.  If I get into something, that is just one of those things that you've heard a million times with your buddies. 
[01:02:00]  And there's a big difference.  There is a difference, yeah.  It's not a good enough insult for a guy that isn't black to use the black atomic bomb word.  I was thinking more if you were in a fight with a black person, would you go there?  But that's just like...  Would you be brave enough to go there, I guess, is what I was catching with Ronnie Stateman there.  But Troy isn't using the word faggot to a gay guy.  He's not...  So what Ronnie's saying is, would you say that to a who kid? 
[01:02:30]  Would you say...  No, but to...  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't apply.  No, but what Ronnie is going off the fact that Troy says when he's in an argument, he goes for the jugular.  Uh-huh.  So if you're in an argument with a black guy, would you go for the jugular and start throwing that word around?  But that's the jugular...  But if he was in an argument with a gay guy...  I thought it was a pretty good question by Ronnie.  It's not.  If he was in an argument with a gay guy, would Troy Kwan call him a faggot?  But...  I don't think he would.  He probably would.  If he was arguing with Fez, he might not have said that.  He probably would if you go for the jugular.  You'd think if he got in an argument with Fez, he'd bring out Fez's sexuality? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, if he got too heated.  I don't think so at all.  I think so.  No, I don't think Troy would do that.  I think if you go for the jugular, you go for the jugular.  You're not...  Your filters are completely gone.  I don't think Troy would do that.  Did he name Zito's girlfriend?  Or did he name anybody?  No, no, no.  The point I'm making is, even though he was mad, he still had a weird...  He knew where he was on the air, and he knew what he was doing.  Going for the jugular, like for real, like between two guys off the air.  But he wasn't going for the jugular for real. 
[01:03:30]  Then he's being dishonest there.  Well, I'm just saying...  He was saying that he wasn't going for the jugular.  Right.  He was hitting hard.  He's not naming Zito's girlfriend.  He's not naming people like, yeah, well, that's the fucking lid coming off.  So he didn't do that.  So I think if he was arguing with Fez, I think he'd have enough common sense to not yell, you fat.  Oh, I don't think he wouldn't at all.  I don't think he'd come close.  I would give him a little more credit than that.  When you're arguing with somebody that you know is heterosexual, and you want to take a jab at his manhood, that's what you do. 
[01:04:00]  And if you, you know, and there have been instances where I've had discussions with friends of mine, white guys, and you do drop the N-bomb because, you know, you're like, oh, you're fucking...  Because they're not around.  Because they're not around.  But that's, you know, there are instances.  Well, because you land on a home alarm commercial.  Right.  I think, but Ronnie was, I don't know, because Troy set it up by saying he was going for the juggler. 
[01:04:30]  That's where Ronnie's question is coming from.  That's all.  Yeah, I think, even though I understand why Ron said that.  So now we've got to find going for the juggler, I guess.  Well, I think, no, I think Ron just asked him a question that didn't apply because that's like saying, if Troy said I went for the juggler, to me what Ron asked is the same as going, well, you go for the juggler.  If Zito's girl walked in, would you kick her?  Like what?  It's just a different scenario.  But if he's having the fight with who, kid, just because he's black doesn't mean he's, you know, the N-word. 
[01:05:00]  So he could easily go, well, you're a N-word.  Wouldn't that be going, wouldn't be, wouldn't that be similar?  It wouldn't be the equivalent because he, what I'm saying is he didn't.  A lot of black people would admit there's, you know, the famous Chris Rock bit.  There's black people and there's...  There's a niggers, yeah.  He wouldn't, I don't think he would do that because he didn't say faggot to a gay guy.  And again, the intent is hugely different.  Right, right.  It's weird, man.  Like, naming Zito's girlfriend, naming this, to me, would have been the equivalent of that. 
[01:05:30]  Like, that would have been, like I said, the lid coming off, fucking nothing held back.  But he did have a filter.  Just because you go for the juggler, you try to be hurtful.  It doesn't mean that you're a fucking reckless psychopath.  Now, Ronnie asking why Troy Kwan didn't call Zito a nigger.  Like, why wouldn't you just throw that word out?  Well...  No, he was saying Shade 45.  I know.  He was basically saying, look, if you had a fight with a black person, would you go that far?  Was he saying that?  I thought so. 
[01:06:00]  That's where, this is where I'm coming from.  But my point is...  And just because a black person in the studio doesn't mean he's the N-word.  No.  But it doesn't even apply to this argument.  But if you went there, it would piss off a black guy, right?  Yeah, but that's a whole other story.  But it's going for the juggler.  I think that's Ronnie's point.  Well, he could say, go for the juggler.  And if you're arguing with a straight guy, that's the juggler.  When you're in an argument with a straight guy, you say faggot.  That drives a straight guy crazy.  You fucking say your girlfriend's fucking other guys. 
[01:06:30]  That too.  That too.  Right.  But if you're having a fight with a black guy saying the N-word, that would drive him nuts.  Well, yeah, but that's a different argument than this.  I don't know how different that really is.  It's different because that's the real deal.  You're calling a black guy nigger, that's bad.  You're calling a straight guy faggot, that's bad for straight guys.  You get really fucking pissed off, even though you know it's not true.  But it's different.  Because it's like you're getting disrespected by the person.  It's a totally different argument.  It is.  It's completely different.  I think it's under the same umbrella, to be honest with you. 
[01:07:00]  A gay guy a faggot is the same thing as that.  Right.  That's it.  Calling a gay guy a faggot is the same thing as calling one of the guys from Shade a nigger.  That is the bad thing.  Yeah.  Now, calling a white guy a nigger is silly.  Yeah, but Ronnie wasn't talking about calling a white guy.  Right.  He mentioned Shade 45.  We all know what that means.  But that's just it.  That's why I'm saying Ronnie's point doesn't apply.  That's why I'm saying Ronnie's point doesn't apply.  Because now I'm, uh, let's just hear it again.  Friends a slut. 
[01:07:30]  You yourself are with other men.  Right.  I mean, when I, in a verbal fight, I go for the throat.  But why didn't you drop the n-bomb like that?  Do you think Who Kid or somebody else might have been offended if you said you act like  the n-word?  Okay.  Now I see what he's doing.  Hold on.  I'll argue with Who Kid.  He's saying the way Fez is pissed off at hearing the word faggot being used in that argument.  Right.  Would Who Kid be as pissed off if, if, uh, Troy called Zito a nigger?  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  In this room and, and found out about it.  He'd be like, oh man.  Then obviously that, of course that doesn't apply.  But that's not a, that's not a viable fucking insult.  It doesn't apply if you say that word to a white guy.  It's not an insult to a guy, you know?  That's where I'm in agreement with you.  Right, right.  Yeah.  But I thought Ronnie was talking about if you had a fight with like Who Kid, would you  go that far?  Yeah, yeah.  Meaning, because you said you're going for the throat.  So going for the throat, if you're in an argument with a black guy, would go down that road and  say the n-word.  It just didn't apply in that argument.  You're trying to bash somebody. 
[01:08:30]  I see what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that would be stupid to call Zito the n-word.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense.  Because if you're calling him a faggot in order to chip away at his masculinity, then,  you know, then the insult applies.  Do you think people in shade 45 would be like, oh, that's just what happens when guys  argue with each other?  Well, I mean, first of all, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say the n-word with an R. I might  say it with an uh. 
[01:09:00]  I might say nigga.  But I don't know if I would say that in a fight.  But I would say that word, yeah.  And I've said it in front of a kid.  Because you're threatened by black men.  You're not threatened by gay guys.  I'm not threatened by anybody.  I mean, I'm not going to go around.  I'm not threatened by anybody here.  So I'm not.  But Troy, even the way you explained it, this is what guys do.  Even that explanation is like gay people aren't guys.  They're not even men.  But listen, Fence, I know what you're saying by saying that. 
[01:09:30]  But you're being too literal.  Yes.  Troy's not saying gay guys aren't guys.  Troy is talking about just, he's talking about straight guys in that context.  Or guys that are, you know, we think are straight.  And you know that.  He's not saying gay guys aren't guys.  But he's saying when two dudes argue, they say faggot.  You can't discount the insult to a straight guy to question his sexuality.  It's primal.  It's something that you can't just write off because it might offend another group. 
[01:10:00]  But you also can't make it this bigger deal than it is.  Right.  And I understand Fez would be very offended by that.  And, you know, you almost got to go, sorry.  That's the world we live in.  That's the way it is.  And I don't think it's changeable because it is so primal.  Man's fucking masculinity is a very important thing to people.  And to question that is an insult. 
[01:10:30]  But it doesn't take away from the gay guy.  You're not bashing the gay guy.  You're tearing down the masculinity of the straight guy.  Right.  Meaning the straight guy, you know, thought he was straight.  And you're saying, no, you're a faggot.  Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  If Fez wants to be literal, like literally language speaking, when you call somebody a faggot,  the primal thing is basically you're questioning his ability to reproduce.  Exactly.  That's the same thing as calling somebody a pussy or weak or soft.  You're saying that you're not capable of fucking carrying on the species. 
[01:11:00]  Like that's the basic guts of the insult.  It really is the same as saying, you pussy, you weakling.  Right.  And again, if you're not going to literally go over it, that's not what you mean when you're arguing.  Did you ever argue with somebody and say, guy, you're not capable of carrying on the species.  I mean, you're not being that fucking literal.  You just, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is the, you're right.  That's the primal insult in it.  It is.  And it'll always be there. 
[01:11:30]  I'll go back.  If you're, you know, if you're arguing with a black guy, would you go that far?  But would he say that to a gay guy?  We don't know.  Right.  He didn't say it to a gay guy.  So we don't know if he'd say that to who kid in an argument any more than we know if he'd say faggot to fess in an argument.  He might not.  But you're assuming all black people are ends then if you say it that way, don't you think?  If you don't say it to a gay guy, what do you mean?  If you say, but if you say, black people don't think they're ends.  Black people, if you argue with a black guy and you say nigger. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  Everyone knows what just happened and what that insult is.  Because if you're arguing with a gay guy, a known gay guy, because that's the difference, you don't always know.  But you know someone's gay and they're openly gay and you say you're a faggot.  Everyone knows that's a vicious, personal, and intended context.  But if a straight guy doesn't want to be called a faggot, a black guy doesn't want to be called the n-word.  Isn't it as simple as that?  No.  A straight guy.  Because they're not.  If you're a straight guy and someone calls you a faggot, that pisses you the fuck off. 
[01:12:30]  So if you're a black guy and in an argument where someone's going for the throat, they call you the n-word,  wouldn't that fucking piss off the black guy big time?  Well, I think we know it does.  And isn't that similar?  Why isn't it similar?  I'm still confused here.  Because the gay guy being called, because you're not being called an accurate slur.  It's almost like if you're a straight guy and you're being called a faggot, that's just a dumb insult.  But I think it's, I would guess it's a lot worse if you're a known gay guy that everybody knows is gay and then someone says you faggot.  Right.  Because no one beats, black people hate nigger because it's been used to hold them down and target them. 
[01:13:00]  And in all honesty, they've been treated fucking horrendously for so many years.  But Zito's not a gay guy.  And he was pissed off by being called a faggot.  So you're saying if a black guy isn't a nigger, then he'd be pissed to be called that.  Right.  It's really kind of a semantics thing there.  Because straight guys have not been victimized by the word faggot.  To break it down, to call a gay guy a faggot is worse because gay people have been bashed and beaten up and fucking abused. 
[01:13:30]  And that word has been heavily tied into it the same way nigger has been heavily tied into blacks being treated so terribly.  Here's a way that you can tie it together a little bit.  If you were at the gay parade, let's say, and there was this flamboyant gay guy.  And he's got his dick out and he's harassing you and your girl and he's waving his dick at fucking just something that is very insulting.  You turn around, pissed off and go, hey, knock it off, you faggot.  Well, gay guys would probably say the same thing. 
[01:14:00]  Yes.  And then you get rid of her.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But that would be like, all right, now I'm going to go for the jugular because I'm going to see what I see and use the worst possible slur because he's fucking pissing me off.  That doesn't apply here.  So if a black guy does the same thing and he's doing something stereotypical that people don't like, you turn around and use that slur.  That stuff is easy, but I'm talking about like when, you know, Zito is not a gay guy. 
[01:14:30]  Right, right.  And he's insulted by, you know, being called that.  Yeah.  So now if Zito's black and, you know, I'm just trying to keep it very simple.  I don't think Troy would have anyway.  Troy starts throwing the N-word around.  Yeah, if he's some affluent black guy.  Because he went for the throat.  But that's.  There's a different.  I think that's sort of what Ronnie's getting at.  Are you brave enough to call a straight guy a faggot, but you're not brave enough to call a black guy, you know.  But Ronnie's wrong then if that's what he's saying.  In that context.  Because calling Zito a faggot when he's not is the same as saying, hey, Zito, your mother's a whore and fuck sailors when she doesn't. 
[01:15:00]  Like, because you're not taking something that's accurate or real to that person.  The argument that Ronnie might have made is if, say, he wore his hat sideways.  Right.  If he came in with all.  Or he liked hip hop.  Right, right, right.  And then Troy said, you dress like a nigga.  Like, if he said that.  Right.  To me, that's a more accurate thing because he's not black and he's being called that.  And it's a real meaning is a real thing because he's actually going off the way he dressed. 
[01:15:30]  Then maybe.  But I don't think that's for Ronnie, man.  It's due.  Even that explanation is like gay people aren't guys.  They're not even men.  No, that's not what I'm saying.  That's the way it came off.  I have no problem with you or your sexuality.  I've told you that.  And if you were.  I say hi to you all the time in the hallway.  I try to be as polite as I can.  Even when we got into a little argument on the air.  I still was trying to be cool with you.  I don't care what you do.  I don't care what you do or be or who you are. 
[01:16:00]  I think that's great.  But, you know, when you're in an argument with somebody and the adrenaline's flowing,  you say things to try to fucking hurt people's feelings.  That's just the way it is.  And it has nothing to do with you.  And you should never feel threatened by me whatsoever.  Because I have nothing but love and respect for you.  Maybe I'm repeating myself.  But it's like there's, like I said earlier, there's so much to go after Zito on.  Then, why drag gay people into it? 
[01:16:30]  It makes no sense to me.  But that's just, like I said, when you get into an argument with a guy.  It's not dragging gay people into it.  It's dragging his masculinity into it.  It's questioning his sexuality, which to a guy is an insult.  A straight guy.  A straight guy is an insult.  And it might seem weird to say that, look, he's not bashing gay people.  He's bashing Zito, a heterosexual guy.  Okay, just because you're insulting one doesn't mean you're insulting the other. 
[01:17:00]  It's a strange thing, but that's how it kind of works.  Have gays ever had the discussion that they would be insulted if they were called straight?  Yeah, that's kind of funny.  Ugh, those nasty vaginas they deal with.  Ronnie should ask Fez that today.  Wouldn't he be insulted?  Because that's how you flip that, right?  You tit-licker.  Right.  Let's say Troy is fighting with Fez, and now instead of saying faggot a million times, he's saying, you know, straight.  You straight boy. 
[01:17:30]  You straight boy.  Would that really be insulting to Fez?  Mm-hmm.  It should be, right?  You'd think.  If you're proud of who you are, you'd be really fucking pissed off if someone called you straight, right?  I think if people were being...  So what's that about?  ...beat up because they were straight?  Yeah.  Then, you know, I think that would be Fez's argument.  It's like, well, if people were being assaulted based on their straight sexuality, then it would be a problem.  But, you know, that doesn't seem to be it.  I think gay people are very sensitive to gay bashing and being assaulted. 
[01:18:00]  Obviously, they should be.  But you can't look at every single slur, especially when it's not even directed at a gay person, as this gateway to an assault.  Right.  It seems to be that no matter what is said, if it's even an inkling of offensive to a gay person, it's now tied to a gay assault and gay bashing and hate crimes when that's not the case. 
[01:18:30]  Certain things become like these colloquialisms.  Like, everybody knows that when...  Again, I'm not saying it's nice, but when two quote-unquote straight guys are arguing and one of them says, you faggot, it's not literally meaning...  All kidding aside, I think that you're a homo...  All kidding aside.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, exactly.  And we kind of give each other...  We understand certain things are happening in an argument.  Like, again, insulting somebody's mother.  Yeah.  Like, it's just, it's one of those dumb fucking things that starts when you're young and you realize how we think that we're advanced. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  And then you're 35 years old and you're both wearing suits and one guy's like, you cocksucker, you dick licker.  It's the same shit as your mother.  And Joe in Chicago makes a pretty good point.  Biggest difference is when you call a straight guy gay, he can't really defend it.  Technically, you really can't if you think about it.  I know I'm not.  Yeah, that's what you say a million times, but, you know...  You are.  Right.  I kind of like that point. 
[01:19:30]  You know inside you're not, but it's really hard to actually prove that, I guess.  Bring a girl here, I'll fuck her and enjoy it.  That's what you would have to do.  Yes.  Bring a girl and I'll prove I'm not.  I'll get hard instantly and, you know, I'll give her a good, you know, fucking bag.  You'll see how much I love pussy.  Right.  That's why I think it gets frustrating.  Pull your cock out.  Ew!  Ew, see?  Right.  See?  I think that's why it's so, like, venomous to a straight guy, because you really officially  can't prove it in front of the guy. 
[01:20:00]  Yep.  And with a guy, you question...  You want to hit hard, you question that man's sexuality.  When he's a heterosexual man, you know that it's...  You know, as a gay man, to say to a heterosexual man, sometimes it's a slap to their pride.  It's a slap to who they are.  It doesn't make it cool.  It doesn't make it right.  But it's just, when you're going for the throat, you go for the throat.  And can you comprehend that...  Troy's doing a very good job here, by the way.  He's saying...  Because he put himself in a very tough spot yesterday.  He did. 
[01:20:30]  I'm sure there's a lot of people around here looking at him a little differently.  When we pause this...  And I think they shouldn't, but that's the reality of this, and I think he's doing a  pretty good job defending himself.  Because we're pausing the recording and then discussing it.  Right.  And then we hit play again, and Troy's pretty much saying what we're saying.  Right.  So he's...  And that's right off the cuff with him.  So, yeah, he's doing a good job.  Can you comprehend that gay people, even in this city where it is pretty progressive, that 
[01:21:00]  since January there's been dozens of attacks on gay people, so that when someone hears that  and feels like, alright, that's how people really feel about gay people, that they're targets  to be smacked around when you don't like what they're doing, whether it has to do with  being gay or not, that that kind of affects gay people, that it sticks in a special place  that it might not stick with a heterosexual person? 
[01:21:30]  But at what point, you know, okay, faggots, that's inappropriate to say, so then sissy, is  that okay, or do I have to exclude that now from my vocabulary when I go out?  After somebody, it's like, when you're in a verbal fight with somebody, it's just, you're  going for blood, you're going for the throat.  What he's saying is that gay people are lower than straight people.  Right.  So this is the way to take the straight person and lower him down, embarrass him by calling  him something less.  Obviously, I mean...  See, Ronnie's the most twisted person on this channel. 
[01:22:00]  Ronnie is fucking...  Let's stop already.  I don't know.  Alright.  Fucking primetime did a pretty good job of doing the same thing during the argument.  Ronnie's twisted.  Although, in that moment, Ron kind of explained, I think, what gay people hate about it is  that we know you're not saying, hey, you're a homosexual, but why does what I am have to  be the insult?  Exactly.  It's like the equivalent of you arguing with Anthony going, you're a Norton, and me going,  gee, what the fuck did I...  Right.  I'm not saying...  I'm not saying that there's not a brilliance to what...  It was brilliant. 
[01:22:30]  He summed it up right there.  Ronnie is...  He's summing it up, but he's also...  He's brilliant and twisted at the same fucking time.  And I'm on to him, man.  He's the true puppet master around here.  And lower him down.  No.  Embarrass him by calling him something less.  No.  Obviously...  I mean...  Nobody's lower than anybody.  That's what you were trying to do to Zito.  There's no color.  I'm going after his throat.  I am doing everything I can to try to put him down in a verbal argument.  Okay?  So...  Then talk about his bald spot.  Talk about how he... 
[01:23:00]  What?  I didn't know how he had a bald spot, but I'll have to make a note of that.  God.  What about bald Americans?  Talk about how he's constantly kissing up to manage...  What about kiss-ass...  But first...  Hmm.  Talking about someone's bald spot, that would be very hurtful to bald people.  I think that's actually worse than calling a straight guy a faggot, because the bald spot  is real.  You really do have one.  Right.  But I mean, that's a tough thing for guys when they start losing the shirt.  Yeah.  But Fez thinks that's completely okay, because guess what? 
[01:23:30]  Fez isn't bald.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  So...  I...  I would like to ask Fez why that's okay.  There's always going to be things that other people think is okay, and they're going to  be offended by something else.  We've talked about that for years.  And that's the world we have always lived in.  And if we give in to everything, we wouldn't be able to talk about anything.  Right.  And that's God's honest truth.  I...  Because Fez is saying that's not as bad, to be bald. 
[01:24:00]  But you line up a whole bunch of bald people, they'll tell you how horrendous that is, and  how they haven't been able to get girls because of it.  They probably didn't get the promotion because of it.  All sorts of shit happens to bald guys because they don't have hair.  There's probably a bunch of straight guys...  Not all of them, obviously, but...  There's probably a bunch of straight guys out there that would suck a cock to trade for  hair.  You know what?  So as far as the gay or bald thing goes...  You know what?  As long as it's not being videotapes.  Absolutely.  Full head of hair. 
[01:24:30]  That's it.  One time.  One dick.  But how about...  One dick, you get your hair back.  How about while you're doing it?  But then you know who all the dick suckers are because they're the ones walking around  with the full heads of hair.  Sam's had like six or seven.  Sam puts him behind his cheek like a squirrel.  Then you find out it's like Rogaine and you can't stop or it falls back out.  You just got a dick in your mouth every day.  Wait, would you do it, though, if while you did it, you had to look at yourself in the  mirror and you had to watch your cheek bulge out in the face?  Just asking. 
[01:25:00]  You were just...  Oh, Jesus.  You could do that.  If you could take a comb and run it through your lustrous hair as you're looking in the  mirror.  You're blowing a dick and you're blow-drying your hair at the same time.  I was like, all right.  Fuck it.  It's a win-win.  This looks great.  But Fez heard his argument there a little bit.  He just threw bald guys away.  Like, look, that's okay.  You know?  That's okay.  But again...  That's not okay to a lot of bald guys.  I'm sorry.  He could use the argument again that bald people aren't being sought out and targeted. 
[01:25:30]  There should be, though.  Let's be honest.  Absolutely.  Hey, chrome dome.  Especially the ones that do the comb-over that starts in the back of their neck.  Oh, should they be beaten?  Yes, they should.  You look ridiculous.  You look ridiculous.  I also think Fez is in a unique position, or maybe a very calm position, of a guy who's  fucking, like, not been openly gay for all these years and has probably wanted to say  things, like, how many times in his life has Fez, or any guy who's, like, you know, not  out of the closet, heard gay slurs, or just the word faggot, and wanted to say, like, 
[01:26:00]  shut the fuck up about that.  Right, right.  Like, but you can't.  Now he can, so...  Now he can, so it's, like, a lot of times it's probably refreshing to just be able to  speak up where you weren't, like...  Ronnie's argument about bringing a certain group down by insulting somebody else, bringing,  like, straight guys down to the level of homosexual, that doesn't really apply.  Technically, on a fucking, on a slide rule it might, but I think in real-world application, 
[01:26:30]  you're not thinking I'm going to lower him down to the level of the, oh, the homosexual.  You're just questioning one of the most important things to a straight guy, his sexuality.  Okay, yeah, I was going to say it to guys in general, yeah, the manhood, whatever.  The manhood to a straight guy.  Right.  That is a, the hugest insult you could bestow on your standard straight gentleman.  Right.  It doesn't mean that you're demeaning gay guys. 
[01:27:00]  It's just, that's how it works out for insults.  It's, it's, no one's really thinking, let me demean the gays by putting that on you.  Say this at a, a GLAAD meeting, let's see how it goes over.  No, it wouldn't wash, I know, it's, it's very...  It wouldn't wash at all, right?  People are very sensitive to words these days, and, and there are certain groups that, uh,  want to make, you know, uh, retard is, is very bad these days.  Right, no. 
[01:27:30]  Uh, things like that.  It, it, and, and it means nothing.  It, it, it, the, the battle that's going on for words doesn't really help the cause.  More importantly, do you think?  It trivializes it.  You think the radio wizard's searching out a penis right now?  Oh, boy.  Look at that full head of hair.  Oh, well, I heard on the radio today.  It must be true.  It must be true.  It was Opie and Anthony.  What am I listening to?  Just rub it on his head.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that's what they said, because I don't even listen to them.  I just listened with half an ear and decided I'd suck a dick for hair. 
[01:28:00]  But Fez, uh, a little, a little weak in the argument going after the bald guys.  Yeah.  Well, maybe not completely the same thing, but, you know.  Retard's a good example, by the way.  Retard's a great example.  Right.  I didn't think of that.  You argue with a guy and you go, you retard, you're a fucking retard, you show up late  for work.  Right.  You don't actually think that person is like, oh, my God, you have down syndrome.  Like, you're not using it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a lot worse to walk up to a retarded kid and go, you're a fucking...  Oh, God.  No one knows the difference.  Who would ever fucking do that?  It's completely different.  It's completely different. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, Opie, you would do that.  No.  No, no, no.  I'm a very strong advocate for the mentally challenged.  But I will throw that fucking retard word around like crazy.  But I don't think about it like I'm hurting retarded children.  But, you know, now we're going to hear from the parents and they will explain why that is  extremely hurtful.  I know.  Because they're raising, you know, a kid with special needs.  And when you take it to the personal level, of course you're going to be offended. 
[01:29:00]  I understand that.  But, again, being offended isn't, you know, against the law.  It's not...  It kind of is these days.  Yeah, right?  It kind of is.  And it's not a gateway to assaults.  I mean...  Or a pepper.  Honestly.  Or a pepper.  Fucking chipper.  Come on, do some more spice jokes.  Fuck yeah.  Fucking...  Got anything on ketchup?  I've been writing.  Yeah, it's going slow.  Ketchup.  Fuck!  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  God, sorry.  What?  I didn't know how to boss about it, but I have to make a note of that.  God.  Talk about how he's constantly kissing up to management.  I did bring that up, actually.  He put him down.  He wanted to lower him down, so he compared him with being gay.  I don't get what you don't understand about that.  But that's...  I'm not putting somebody down.  What I don't understand is why do that?  Ron, you've grown up on the playground.  And you know, like, you put a...  No, Troy.  Call Ron out.  I know.  Ron, he's dragging your legs under a bus. 
[01:30:00]  Call him out.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Ronnie.  You rule.  I'm not putting somebody down.  What I don't understand is why do that?  Ron, you've grown up on the playground.  You know.  Like, you put a...  You may have nothing against gay people, but you take a heterosexual man and you question  his sexuality.  They take...  Straight guys sometimes take offense to that.  Sure.  I'm not saying that this gay person is less than this person. 
[01:30:30]  That's...  You're putting words in my mouth.  The only reason is because a gay...  What you're saying to a straight man, I'm going to lower you down...  But it's not lower.  To the level.  It's just...  It's a lateral move.  This is what you do.  You decide...  But you don't take a penis in your mouth.  You're verbally gay bashing him.  It's not verbally gay bashing.  No, verbally gay bashing.  Stop.  No, I...  I can't see that.  It's a lateral move.  You're not lowering anyone.  It's a lateral move that's on the other end of the spectrum.  You're not talking about going...  Taking anyone down or putting anyone up.  It's the same level at the opposite ends of a spectrum. 
[01:31:00]  Sorry.  I think I changed my opinion a little bit on this today, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, the whole manhood thing you brought up.  That's very good.  Because I think maybe part of me...  I felt like I was...  Yeah, making the other guy a little...  Guy a little lower, but it's...  But no, I don't...  I think I learned a little bit today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand what you're saying.  Yeah.  He's got to make a good...  The retard argument would be a good point to Ron. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the same as calling a guy a retard argument.  Right.  You don't actually...  Like, because Ron is going by, like, almost...  Okay, if there's a gun to your head, and these are the literal translation of the words,  but everybody knows that in common interactions, that's not what we do.  But, like, saying you're a retard to a guy who you know isn't retarded...  Right.  It's like, you know, do you really think that he's got down...  No.  Yeah.  You don't.  But people would say that offends all the retarded people out there.  Yeah, you'd say you're...  How come you're not thinking that literally when you argue?  I don't...  You're not.  Exactly. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  Why the fuck is this literal whole thing coming into play here?  It's during an argument, you're going to say things, and you're not thinking that you're  going to bring someone down.  But how...  Like, people do it when there's certain trigger words.  Like, you know, he's saying something about, so you can go and suck management's dick.  Like, how come nobody is saying, and why, Troy, are you implying, truthfully, that he's going  to put a management penis in his...  Right, right.  Because people know he's just saying that in this, you know...  Yeah, that could be interpreted as a gay bashing, if you wanted to take it that far. 
[01:32:30]  Let's get to the end of this.  It's verbally gay bashing him.  It's not verbally gay bashing.  Just calling a guy a faggot, it's just, it could be used in a slap in the face.  It's like, if you're going to take that word away from people in an argument, it's like,  like I said, do I have to not say sissy now?  Am I not allowed to say, you know, like, you look like a queen?  Is that now offensive?  It's like, well, you can't say that now.  It's like...  I just don't think you get it because you're not gay.  I just don't think you understand what it does. 
[01:33:00]  I don't think you understand...  Especially with the, what's the word, the anger, the violent anger...  But that's not towards gay people.  ...that came from your voice.  That has nothing to gay people.  That has everything to do with Mark Zito.  That has nothing...  I don't care about gay people.  I don't.  Troy was dealing with his own sexuality.  I have no problem.  I don't care what they do.  Hammer that back down.  I know what I care.  I don't care.  But if I'm in a verbal argument, I go for the throat. 
[01:33:30]  After that tirade, it sounded like you do care.  Like, that's how you judge people, and...  Well, I'm sorry if that's what you pulled out of it, but I'm telling you now, face-to-face,  that's not...  That was not my intent.  And when you add in the threat of violence with it...  That's just towards him.  I understand that.  I understand you're calling him that name.  And if he's not gay, then I'm not going after gay people.  If Mark Zito is not a homosexual, then I'm not going after him as a gay guy. 
[01:34:00]  Then why say it?  I told you why I said it.  But it doesn't make sense if you don't think that there's something lower about gay people.  No.  That's right.  Yeah, I just agree with that.  But, Ron, you know that he's not...  Yeah.  He's not really thinking that he's gay, and you know that he's not being literal saying  gay people are lower.  Technically, that is...  I think when you argue with someone, you say you're a faggot, it is a way of saying that  the gay guy is the lower guy, maybe it's lateral, but I think it's more of going, hey, you're  a faggot, but you're not literally being that...  You're not thinking it through like that when you're just two guys yelling at each other. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Because that's not what the argument's about.  Like, you know, again, if it was directed at Fez, who is gay, and he said, you're just  a cocksucking...  Then you're...  It's a direct...  That's brutal, right.  But everybody knows that that happens when you argue, and maybe it's not the right thing  to say.  If you call a guy a little bitch, it's the same thing.  You're affecting his manhood.  You're calling him a little bitch, which, you know, hey, you're a woman.  You're not a man.  Now, that would be insulting to women. 
[01:35:00]  Are you lowering the woman down because you're calling a guy a bitch?  You're, again, lowering his masculinity, his sexual prowess, his ability to procreate,  whatever it is, you're not thinking of the slur on a person that would be offended by  it, and you're lowering that.  It doesn't even come into play in your mind.  Yeah, I think you're not...  Because whenever you use somebody...  Whenever somebody is the insult... 
[01:35:30]  Right.  When you say to somebody, hey, you're a queer, that's the insult.  You're obviously saying that the queer is lower because that's used as the insult, but  you're not being that literal.  People aren't thinking it through when you're arguing.  If me and you have an argument, I say, in fact, I'm not thinking, wow, Anthony, you're  a homosexual, therefore you're technically...  I don't think you're...  I don't think you're lowering the guy.  I think being a straight guy, being called a faggot, you're lowering his masculinity.  You're not lowering the gay guy.  It's not like, wow, you're equating me with a gay person? 
[01:36:00]  That's terrible because there's so much lower than...  You're not saying that.  You're lowering his masculinity.  Not the actual gay person.  It's...  I don't see it that way.  I don't see it as lowering.  I'm just wondering things I've wanted to hear while a strap-on was being tickled on my  highness.  Oh, boy, if I were only kidding.  Oh, Jimmy.  You don't think that there's something lower about gay people.  It doesn't make sense. 
[01:36:30]  But why don't you understand that when you go out...  When you're in a verbal fight with somebody and you question their heterosexuality, it's  like...  It's like a slap in a heterosexual's face.  But nobody goes...  If that's your point in trying to do it, nobody goes, oh, well, then you're a Russian or you're  a high school student.  And they don't do it with any other descriptive thing than being gay.  I don't know about that.  I mean, I'm sure it happens in other cases, but this is just the direction it went. 
[01:37:00]  Well, I think we're at that point where, you know, he came in and explained himself.  You don't necessarily agree.  Right.  He doesn't necessarily agree with you.  But Troy's pointed out his problem is not with you.  It's with Zito.  Yeah.  Like I said, I have nothing but love and respect for you.  So...  And I try to show you that not even on the air, but off the air all the time.  Do I not?  You've always been nice to me in the hallway. 
[01:37:30]  But, I mean, don't you get upset if I look at you with a different eye.  I mean, if you do, you do.  I can't help it.  You don't give a shit.  No.  But I am not...  I do never want you to feel threatened by me in any way, shape, or form.  Okay?  You know, and nothing of that was directed towards you.  I don't care if you're gay or straight.  I don't care what you are.  I don't care.  Unless you guys have an argument about something else.  Yeah.  Well, then I know that doesn't come up.  And you don't, you know, but it's just like the same.  Or do I have to worry about getting beat up like Zito does? 
[01:38:00]  No.  No.  Absolutely not.  And I'm not going to beat him up.  I just talk shit.  You know, it's just shit talking on the air.  Like, you know, at the end of the day, we have an argument here on the air.  It's fine.  Who cares?  Nobody cares.  There we go.  All right, Troy.  Thanks.  A lot happens at the end of the day.  Have you noticed that?  Yeah.  At the end of the day, it's like, wow.  That's when all business takes place.  Everything's got to fucking tighten up right there.  That's right.  Tie up all loose ends.  The rest of the day is just a waste of time.  But at the end of the day.  At the end of the day, it's time to fucking get some things done. 
[01:38:30]  Another one of those fucking things you hear a million times that I hate.  And then, you know, at the end of the day.  Oh, boy.  At the end of the day.  Rush, rush, rush.  Ugh.  Yeah, rush, rush, rush.  What is the end of the day?  Is it an hour?  Is it two hours?  How many hours is the end of the day?  How long do we got?  Because I need to know how much time I got to get everything done.  And do you know when people on Jupiter say it, they only need it ten hours later.  Ooh.  Well, that was a very interesting hour, I got to say.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. 
[01:39:00]  Very interesting.  A lot of interesting points in there.  I do like that we do have a good forum here to just rally that around and fucking discuss  language, speech.  So, you're having a fight with a gay guy, you would have to call him straight for the  equivalent, right?  Sort of, yeah.  In a perfect world.  Again, if...  No, I know in a perfect world.  Again, if straight people thought that when you insult gay people by calling them straight  that it opens the door for people that are straight to be assaulted because they're straight. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  That's why...  That adds the big thing.  I know.  That's why this was so interesting.  Yeah.  I don't think it says black and white.  Yeah.  I really don't.  I think there's a lot of shades in there.  Absolutely.  I really do.  It's more of a gradient, isn't it?  Yes, yes, yes.  That's the way it is.  I mean, if...  Mm-hmm.  Because I think a gay guy would laugh at you if you're in an argument calling him straight.  Yeah.  They'd be like, that's just silly, right?  It is silly.  I don't know.  And what is so insulting if a gay guy decided, you know, if you pictured a gay guy like railing 
[01:40:00]  some woman, it's like, oh, oh, wow, how insulting is that?  It's not.  No, because...  But now you get a heterosexual guy and the conjured image is him sucking on another man's  penis.  Right.  It's more of an insult that way.  That's deeply insulting to a straight guy.  Period.  Based on masculinity.  Period.  Not based on the fact that the gay guy is any lower on the fucking...  I think we can agree that's deeply insulting to the straight guy, but for what reason is 
[01:40:30]  where it's a little shady, I think.  I think it has to do with a very primal argument.  But I like your manhood argument.  Because you take pride in being a man, whatever that means to you.  Right.  But part of it, and I think to the majority of straight guys, is your sexual prowess and  your ability to get a girl and satisfy a girl.  Right.  And, you know, that's part of it.  Well, because that takes work, too.  So, you know, you've got your skills are in question and all that shit.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Interesting.  I liked it.  I liked it a lot.  Yeah.  We didn't really accomplish much, but...  I don't think we changed anyone's fucking opinions.  I'll tell you this much.  I think Troy handled himself pretty well.  I think he did.  Fez did all right.  And I got to tell you, I fucking love Fez.  Absolutely.  And Troy, I, you know, if he gets any shit whatsoever that goes any further than just,  hey, I will back him up 100% on this one.  He shouldn't catch anything for just using language.  As long as we can back him up between 10 and 10.05, though. 
[01:41:30]  Well, I'm out of here at 10.  I mean, come on.  We all have lives to lead.  I'll give him five minutes after 10 o'clock.  If they want to talk to me in the elevator.  I'll try to save his job, right.  We'll back him up as long as it's in the elevator, all the way down to our cars.  Yeah.  Because he didn't, when we had the gay off, Troy was the one who was pushing that and  having fun with it.  And, like, there wasn't any, like, his behavior was not at all.  No, no.  You know, or when, who was the guy, what was his name?  Go-Go Harder.  Go-Go Harder.  Came in.  Like, you know, Troy didn't feel weirded out. 
[01:42:00]  No.  That was the real guy.  Right.  And Troy did more gay shit than I would assume Fez has.  You're probably right.  You're right.  I mean, Fez should not feel threatened.  There's no hostility in the workplace because Troy was arguing with Zito and threw out some  fucking slurs.  If Fez says, hey, man, you said faggot and I just didn't like it because I don't like  that word.  I think that's fair.  Fez doesn't like it.  There you go.  Right.  The basic truth of that is Fez doesn't like that word and he's annoyed that he heard 
[01:42:30]  it in an argument.  He's like, hey, that's kind of shitty.  But it's like, come on, man, you're not threatened by Troy.  You've been around Troy many times.  You could even say if you, you know, if you, you do, uh, you're friendly with me and you  respect me, I would appreciate it if you just don't use that, uh, language or something.  You know, you could even get away with saying that and that's fine.  Uh, but, uh, but then trying to make it that, that there's some kind of violence, right?  Rock pup on Twitter, he writes gay versus bald is an insult.  I'm sure my father would have cried just the same if I told him I was losing my hair. 
[01:43:00]  Oh God.  See, there's all.  Yeah.  That's funny.  And then we better move on because NY, uh, P secure says enough already with this bit  bit.  I wish you could see the fucking phones and the Twitter.  It's called a discussion.  It's a pretty bit, a pretty intense discussion.  Enough with your sketch.  Enough with that skit you did.  That cute little skit.  It's a skit, a sketch.  Yeah.  People would all, it's like, and this is the type of stuff that happens on jobs all the 
[01:43:30]  time.  People fucking, people are like enough with this.  Every one of you on your job, maybe not to this extent, cause it's not on the air, but  there really is a difference on the air and off the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But everyone has to deal with this language shit, the jobs, you all have this fucking nonsense  to deal with.  Everyone has an opinion too.  It's all over the place, which I kind of like this guy writes, uh, moon rock, uh, moon  rocks lives.  I guess, uh, calling a guy a faggot in an argument is the same as saying as a tiny dick  emasculating.  Yeah.  It is an emasculating thing. 
[01:44:00]  It's emasculating to a straight guy.  Yeah.  Cause you take pride in the fact that you're straight.  And I got a big peck on.  You're bringing down the small dick guys though.  And then if you pull your dick out to prove that it's not tiny, then people go, wow,  you're gay.  Why would you do that?  So.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  Vicious cycle.  Right.  All right.  We got a lot of guests coming on.  Mike Baker stopping by to say hi.  Oh, we got Dana White.  Very, very cool.  We got him for what?  About a half hour.  He's got a very busy day of press in New York. 
[01:44:30]  Dana.  Of course, uh, the owner of UFC.  Well, he's one of the three.  Yes.  And Anna Gunn.  I think people know that.  I don't know why I just said that, but just in case they don't, I guess.  And Anna Gunn.  Yeah.  It's Kyler.  From what?  From Breaking Bad.  Yeah.  I got to start watching that show.  It's fucking great.  How many, how many episodes am I behind?  Ah, here are a few seasons.  Just a few?  Yeah.  Knock that off in a weekend.  Five.  Five?  Fuck. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And podcast number 12 is up.  The Opie and Anthony podcast.  Uh, we went with the, uh, Montreal trip.  It's a Montreal, um, highlight podcast from our two days up there.  And it's only an hour, right?  Just about, yeah.  A little over an hour.  And it's the highlights of our big Montreal trip.  So please go and get the, the Opie and Anthony podcast.  And turn it on to the people that can't afford SiriusXM anymore.  Because I'm hearing from those people a lot, unfortunately.  Yeah.  So at least tell those fucking people you could still get a little taste of what we do. 
[01:45:30]  A little taste.  A little taste.  What's the nugget?  Oh.  This week's nugget is the, uh, Mars Livewire movie trailer.  Where he says, I'm the truth-sayer.  Oh, nice.  Wonderful.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Just people are so fucking dumb.  Oh, no.  Will Rickard on Twitter.  You dope.  Just say you don't want to give up, to me and Anthony, just say you don't want to give  up saying that word and leave it at that.  That's clearly what this is about.  What?  First of all, stupid.  Clearly.  I'm lucky as a stand-up. 
[01:46:00]  I'm able to say a lot of things.  That's not what this is about.  No.  That's not what this is about.  At all.  Arguing these language things, which have become the fucking most important thing in  our cultural existence.  Right.  And what the whole goddamn country is about is not what, you know.  And what no one can really discuss in public.  I feel fucking, I feel very honored that we are able to sit here and actually have  an open discussion about these things.  People clam up. 
[01:46:30]  They get petrified about even talking about this stuff.  Yeah, I think there's a lot of gray area in that whole, you know, discussion we had.  I really do.  But that's what the guy took out of it.  I know.  He and Anthony just want to say faggot.  Just want to say it.  Like, really?  After all the points we made and listened to and Ronnie's points, that's what you take  out of it, you dumb cocksucker.  Not literally.  Boiled it down to that.  Twitter asshole.  Good.  People aren't assholes on Twitter, though.  You're mistaken, yeah.  They're wonderful people.  I'm not mistaken. 
[01:47:00]  I'm Mr. Taken.  Dad!  The OPNNC Show.  The OPNNC Show. 
[01:47:30]  The OPNNC Show.  We'll be right back. 
[01:48:00]  He's been 50 years old today.  What?  The big 5-0.  He always looked older than that.  We met him at the MTV Music Awards, the day Lady Diane Marion did all the interviews  that Colin Quinn loves talking about.  We interviewed him.  Oh, yes, we did.  I hung out with him.  Hung out with him at the bar.  He always looked older than he was.  He's 50.  Fuck.  He looked 50 12 years ago. 
[01:48:30]  He's rough.  Tough life.  I like the Fatboy Slim, though.  You not so much, right?  That's all right.  Just okay.  Am I going to blast this in my car?  Why not?  Yeah, why not?  When I could be playing some fucking Molly Hatchet.  I can't do that.  Mike Baker in the studio.  Mike.  Yeah.  How are you, buddy?  How are you doing?  Fatboy Slim's very good.  You like Fatboy Slim?  You like Fatboy?  Yeah, I was in the U.K. living there and working when he was kind of at the height. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, wow.  His real name's Norman something, isn't it?  No, it's Fatboy.  Just Fatboy?  Yeah, it is Fatboy.  He's named Fatboy.  Yeah.  His parents had a sense of humor.  I have his jeans.  He gave us jeans.  Fatboy Slim jeans.  He had his jeans.  Oh, not his personal ones.  Family member.  Oh, his jeans.  I have his DNA on my gums.  As a memento.  I want you to have my pants.  Oh, that's right.  He was in the studio once, too.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, so I said we interviewed him and he had...  I forgot all about that time.  Oh, yeah.  He brought jeans.  That's right.  We all got jeans.  Mine didn't fit.  Mine didn't either, but I might be able to wear them now.  They were like a slim fit or something. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, now I could probably wear them.  You were Fatboy and I had your jeans.  Yeah, I could fucking moonwalk in them.  Skinny jeans by Fatboy Slim.  What?  Mike, what are you doing, man?  Besides coming by and say hi.  What's going on?  Well, thank you, by the way.  Yeah, this is always great.  We have no choice.  You're a very powerful man.  I know.  I'm coming in today.  Okay, good.  Yeah, thank you.  You make your own rules.  Yeah.  No, you know what?  Just the usual business running around.  I've been busy.  Actually, the only bit of new news is I've been filming a new series for the Travel Channel. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  But they don't have the coordinated promo thing for it yet, so I'm not supposed to talk much about it.  But it's going to be a great show.  It's going to air in the fall, and it'll be a lot of fun.  Is it a cooking show?  It is a cooking show.  Mike Baker cooks.  Exactly.  Mike Baker, candlestick maker.  It's a baking show.  That would be interesting.  Yeah, Jim Martin's the first guest on the first episode.  We make cupcakes, and it's really very touching.  That's awesome.  Bites into it.  There's a bug in there.  A little electronic listening device and a cruller. 
[01:50:30]  By the way, you bring the number down to four.  There are exactly four people we now know that do not have television shows.  No kidding.  Everyone we know has TV shows.  I know.  They lowered the bar so much, they finally got to me.  No, that's good, man.  I'm saying that everyone we know is doing really great.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It's humiliating for us.  Well, when they say, when they give the green light to talk about it and say what it's actually about  and when it's going to air and everything, then if you...  Can we say the name of these?  You're okay.  I'll come on in.  It's going to be called America Declassified.  I don't know if I just give away a secret or not.  Well, you know what? 
[01:51:00]  They're probably going to kick me off.  They're going to cut everything out of the show.  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  We're sorry.  Get some other guy.  Yeah, that's stupid to get the name of the show out there.  Yeah.  Of course that helps.  They're going to do...  But it's a great format.  It's going to be a lot of fun traveling around the country.  Wow.  Talking to some terrific people.  Well, haven't you already traveled around the country?  Is this film...  Yeah, yeah.  It's a film.  Where do you go?  Yeah, all over.  I mean, literally all over.  Libya?  Yeah.  No, it's actually in the U.S.  So this first season is going to be in the U.S.  They're already talking about a second season.  Wow.  So that will probably be overseas. 
[01:51:30]  Mike, did you pitch the show or did they come to you?  No.  Oddly enough, they called.  That's a good drive, Jimmy Nuts.  No, not at all.  I was wondering if he pitched it.  It's a good drive, Jimmy Nuts a little bit, though.  Nah, because they're just calling him today.  You want to do TV?  Because Jimmy obviously deserves to be on TV at this point.  But he's a little frustrated.  Well, they asked me if I thought that Jim would be interested, and I said, I don't think so.  But I've got some free time.  And I don't even have his number, and I don't know how you'd get a hold of him.  It's completely blocked him.  No, that actually bothers me less. 
[01:52:00]  If Mike said I put it together and then pitched it, I would want to know, like, what exactly did you think?  You know, if someone calls, Mike's a handsome dude on TV, and he's a very bright guy.  Oh, he's a bright guy.  Yeah, you're good on TV.  Yeah, no, but it was literally just saying, I think they were looking for someone with somewhat of a background like mine.  I don't know what that means.  I'm getting lost in the weeds, because I guess I'm not supposed to talk about it.  But trust me, in the fall, this is going to hit like a preemptive strike.  Are you doing TV today?  A little bit of Fox, yeah.  Okay. 
[01:52:30]  Because enough with the tie.  Yeah.  What?  Enough with the tie.  I know, I've got to wear the tie.  You've got to wear the tie.  No, it's okay if he's going on TV.  Plus, I've got some business to do.  I've got to meet some clients.  Do you have some Friday casual clothes that you put on every once in a while?  Those Friday casuals?  Friday fraud investigations day.  Yeah, no, I occasionally...  It's the worst casual day at the office.  I know.  And the manager's dressed down.  I moved to Idaho.  I don't know if you knew that.  Yeah, you said that last time.  Did you?  And so I rarely wear it.  I actually had to dig around in my closet and find my ties and suits to come back out to New York. 
[01:53:00]  Well, you really wanted to be where TV was.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the mecca out there.  Why?  Is Idaho slow?  Yeah.  Is it slow?  No, it's great.  It's actually...  You love it, huh?  It's really, really good.  You have family out there?  You're just more for your money?  My wife's from there.  My wife's got family out there.  And, you know, we always go out there to go...  You know, we'd raft and climb and...  Oh, man, that's great.  And, you know, I've got three little boys.  And so before they hit school, I thought, now's the time to do it. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  So they're loving it out there.  A chunk of land?  Get up there, get a little bit of land.  But Boise, you know, the town that we're in, is a great town.  Fantastic town.  You know, it's a very...  I mean, it's an interesting place.  You think about Idaho, and you think about it, it's going to be very sort of compound-like, right?  That's what we think.  It's not like that.  Boise's a university town.  It's probably the only liberal part of Idaho, but it makes it interesting, right?  Yeah.  So anyway, it's really good fun.  The people are fantastic.  Can't say enough about them. 
[01:54:00]  I bet your money goes a long way there, too, right?  Well, that was the thing.  You know what I did?  I came home off the train one day.  Because my main office for diligence, for all your information and security needs, is right here in New York.  And so I came off the metro north, and I lived out in New Canaan.  And the train, you know what it's like.  The train smelled like piss, and it was hot and humid.  And I was kind of watching all these people on the train.  Yeah.  And I was looking at it, and some of them were very good friends.  And I was thinking, you know, you get on this 530 train heading into Midtown. 
[01:54:30]  You know, your kids aren't even awake.  You come home at night.  And I knew a couple of guys that retired from banking that did that for 30 years.  Oof.  And so anyway, I'm sitting there one day on the train.  I'm thinking about this.  I walk into my house.  I'm making a drink.  I'm looking at my wife, and I said, you know, I don't think I need to do this from New York.  I mean, I've got a great staff.  They keep the trains running on time.  Everything's good.  I said, all I do is travel.  And so within a week, she had the house on the market.  Literally inside a week.  She wanted out, too.  She wanted out, too.  Yeah.  And so the whole thing, soup to nuts, took no time at all. 
[01:55:00]  Wow, man.  And you're happy you did it.  Yeah.  Good for you.  I mean, my boys' kindergarten class this past year, twice a week, they put them on a bus,  take them up to the local ski resort, and they go skiing during the day.  Man.  And, you know, I can throw a couple of them in the car.  We get in the truck.  We drive a mile, and we're fly fishing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I jump on a plane.  I can be in New York or Los Angeles or wherever.  Yeah.  You realize, you know, especially in the electronic age, you could do a lot from a distance.  From anywhere.  You don't have to be in one particular location. 
[01:55:30]  I mean, you do.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I feel, you know, I don't take it for granted.  I feel very fortunate.  But I've worked my ass off to build up a company, right?  I mean, I've completely busted my ass for the past, you know, 10 years or so since I  got out of the outfit.  But why don't companies fully accept that yet?  You know, I don't know.  Where most of their employees absolutely could do their jobs from home.  You know, it's like people want to see them at the desk, right?  I know, but why at this point?  You know, it's because it gives management.  It gives management comfort.  If they walk in and they see everybody sitting at their desk, even if they're doing fuck all, 
[01:56:00]  it makes them feel good about it.  Right.  And, you know, they're at a certain time and, you know, I remember when I started at  the agency, not to bang on, I'm sorry, but when I started at the agency, before we got  deployed on training, first time, they had to find a place for you.  So I came in, I sat down on a desk and dealing with a particular issue overseas.  And I remember that the boss said, well, everybody comes in, you know, here at 730 or whatever  it was, you know, I want everybody here at 730.  So I came in at 730 and everybody was sitting around eating donuts and drinking coffee until 
[01:56:30]  about 9 o'clock and then everybody got down to business.  So the next day I come in at 9 o'clock and he says, what are you doing?  And I said, well, I can eat donuts at home.  I don't need to be here to do that.  I'm sure he wanted to hear that from you.  And that started my career very well.  All right, punk.  Yeah.  But you're absolutely right.  They just want to have a little power over you and see your face.  Yeah.  They want to check out on you, see what you're doing.  Well, that's what happened to us.  We had an amazing, you know, space to do our radio show, but they needed to see us every  day, I guess.  So they moved us over here and put us in a smaller spot.  That's it.  Yeah.  No, it gives people a certain level of comfort and it's just complete bullshit. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  You know, as long as the clients or whatever it is that you're doing, whatever service or  whatever you're doing is providing, as long as the clients, the people that are paying  you money to do that are happy, that's the only thing that matters.  That should.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you think about the Bradley Manning verdict?  Well, I think he's going to spend a long time in military hard labor.  I think that they overstepped with that whole.  It was fine.  Yeah.  It was a complete mess.  People still, they had that sad campaign, I am Bradley Manning. 
[01:57:30]  I hate the I am campaign.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  All stolen from Spike Lee, by the way.  Was it?  Yep.  In Malcolm X.  At the end, I am Malcolm X.  I am Malcolm X.  I am Malcolm X.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  It was effective for Malcolm X.  It didn't work so well for Bradley Manning.  Yeah.  It's not the same thing.  I am Bradley Manning.  That wasn't good.  But, no, you know what?  That whole idea that he was acquitted, because that was what a lot of people led with.  He was acquitted for aiding the enemy, as if that was the big charge. 
[01:58:00]  That was the big charge.  It was never going to be proven.  That's a tough thing to prove.  But everything else, he was found guilty on.  And rightly so.  This guy did a tremendous amount of damage.  He released a lot of sources and methods, got people really screwed up.  I mean, when you start telling our enemies overseas the names of our sources and people  cooperating with the U.S. government, it doesn't end well for those people.  What was his motivation?  Was it money or was it...  You know, for these people, and including Edward Snowden, you know, the guy sitting in  Moscow, for these people, usually it's just dysfunctional. 
[01:58:30]  They didn't get enough hugs.  I don't want to oversimplify it, but it's literally, there's a sense of, I'm smarter than you are.  You're not paying enough attention to me.  You're not giving me enough credit.  But if you would listen to me, then everything would be fine.  That's how we feel as a radio show.  If you just had some secrets to leak, then you could make your point.  But no, it's typically, that's the way it is.  Whether you're talking about Snowden, Manning, Hanson, you know, Nicholson, any of the guys  who have committed major treason or any sort of act of this sort, whether you want to 
[01:59:00]  call it treason or not, I know there's a lot of people that think, oh, you know, Snowden's  a hero.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you not believe their motivation, whether it's Julian Assange or anything, do you think,  you're saying, do you believe that the motivation that they say motivated them at all?  No.  I mean, I've been involved in a number of counterintelligence operations looking at people  that, you know, have been screwing us over.  And, you know, it's just, you know, everybody wants to have a grand explanation for what they  do.  Right, right.  And they always want to make it seem like it's bigger.  And people that are supporting them want to think it's on a bigger stage, you know, some  big vision of protecting the Constitution. 
[01:59:30]  That's usually, it's almost always crap, you know, and I hate to say that, it sounds very  cynical, but that's just the way these people are, you know, you don't, it's a very dysfunctional  thing to do, if you think about it.  It really is, if you think about it, and a lot of times people buy this noble excuse  of, you know, I'm helping the people, but you were given a job to do, and certain restrictions  were put on that job, and you have to adhere to them, or you're going to pay the consequences.  That's it.  If you feel your government, and I don't agree with these guys necessarily at all, but if 
[02:00:00]  you feel your government is not doing the right thing, or is being duplicitous with its  own citizens, where does, when is it appropriate to speak up?  Well, at the point where you resign, and at the point where you don't steal classified information,  and then you can go to the press, and you can have a, sort of a conversation, if you  want to, you're still going to be hauled in, and, you know, there's still going to be  consequences, as you said, there's got to be consequences.  You're signing agreements that say, if I have the responsibility of holding on to critical 
[02:00:30]  information, classified information.  Now, don't get me wrong.  The government definitely oversteps on classification of information.  They definitely overreach.  That's a typical thing.  They overclassify.  But, you know, so if you sign those papers, and then you decide, ah, screw it, doesn't matter.  I disagree with this.  Well, where does that end?  Because you get a lot of people in government who, again, will say, well, no, this isn't  the way we should run this operation.  We should run it this way.  So is it all right for that person to go out there and say, no? 
[02:01:00]  Because ultimately, you can always fall back.  If that excuse is okay, then everything's all right.  And we keep lowering that bar.  Yeah, yeah.  But if it's never applicable, like if you sign those papers, and there's always going  to be a jail penalty, then what you've said to people is, once you're in this job, no  matter what your government does, you cannot step out.  You have no recourse.  And call them.  You have no recourse.  Yeah, but I mean, you could take it all of that way, I suppose.  And I don't disagree with the sense of, look, if you find out that, you know, the government 
[02:01:30]  is targeting you guys.  I'm not saying that they are, but.  What do you know?  What do you know?  That I, for one, would step out of the government bubble and say, hey, this is wrong.  You can't be targeting over there.  Please.  It's not fair.  No one knows him.  Are you telling me that Jim Norton's been working for the government against them for  the past 10 years?  Damn it.  That doesn't seem right.  They hired me to prove that Anthony Cummings said something nice once, and I've yet been able  to find it.  I'm still denying it. 
[02:02:00]  Anyway, but no, you're right.  You can take it to it all the way down the road and say, at some point, if you find  out that the government is doing something horrendous, then you should have.  And, okay, when that day comes, and I'm sure that's fine, and you'll do that, and there'll  be the public groundswell that'll say, oh, my God, you mean they're, you know, whatever  it is, it's so heinous.  Yeah.  Otherwise, no, there are consequences, and there's consequences for a reason.  There's reasons why you have secrets, why you keep secrets.  We've provided now a great deal of information to the Chinese, to the Russians, to the terrorist 
[02:02:30]  elements out there about our capabilities within NSA, as an example.  We were talking about Snowden.  You know, manning the same thing.  Provided a great deal of information about sources and methods of what we're doing overseas  in operations.  Right.  And that's very damaging.  And believe me, the Chinese and the Russians are very happy to take that information.  Oh, yeah.  What do you think the Russians are sitting on Snowden?  They probably didn't ask him any questions.  No, I'm sure they didn't.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.  They didn't, you know, sweep his computer.  I'm sure they didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's fine.  What do you see happening with Snowden? 
[02:03:00]  Who wants him?  Who doesn't?  I tell you, who doesn't want him is President Obama.  Yeah.  He has no interest in getting back.  If he did, he would have picked up the phone to Xi, you know, the Chinese head of state,  when this thing first broke in Hong Kong, and he would have said, diplomatically, we want  him back.  It would have been a head of state to head of state conversation.  That's the way those things are done.  And yet he acted as if it was beneath him, it was a legal matter, so we'll get some lawyers  involved, maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  When you're dealing with crap like this, it's not just what you say, it's who says it. 
[02:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  Right?  So, and other leaders pay very close attention to that.  It was clear Obama had, you know, just very little interest in this thing.  You think it was too embarrassing?  I just think he felt it was beneath him.  Oh, really?  I think he still does.  I think he probably, you know, sits around and wonders, what's the big deal, you know, in  his own way?  Could he have gotten him back by calling China directly?  Yeah.  I mean, people talk about, I mean, we don't have a huge amount of leverage over China,  but that's what you have to do to get him back.  Now, would Xi have said, you know, nah, fuck you, you're not going to get him back? 
[02:04:00]  And, you know, well, there's a chance that would have happened, but would China have blown  up the relationship knowing that there would have been that conversation between the two  heads of state?  Probably not.  Yeah.  For this guy, it's like, you know.  Yeah, for this guy.  Exactly.  But once that didn't happen...  For Charlie M?  Yeah.  You hung up on Vladimir Putin for Charlie M?  For Charlie M.  So that's interesting.  I wouldn't have thought of that.  The head of state call doesn't mean a lot.  It means a lot. 
[02:04:30]  It means, and that's how you deliver these messages.  But we did, you know.  And so once that didn't happen, and once Xi had his fun with us, and you have to remember,  I mean, the Chinese state was having a great time with us anyway, because we've been beating  them over the head about cybersecurity, and the fact that the Chinese, for decades now,  have been stealing everything that they can get their hands on.  Yeah.  I mean, they literally just hoover up everything.  Jesus.  So the Chinese thought this was hilarious.  I was about to say, where are we going to talk about this?  Oh, my God.  That's right.  It's going to get Troy off the hook.  They thought this was hilarious.  And so once he goes to Russia, there's no way in hell that Putin's going to want to be seen 
[02:05:00]  as less manly than Xi in China.  Right, right.  So he's definitely not going to play ball.  And again, the only way that would have worked is if Obama had called Putin and said, you  know, we want him back.  That would have had to be a public thing, wouldn't it?  Wouldn't Putin have made it public that Obama would have personally?  Oh, Obama should have made it public.  Obama should have said, they should have come out and said, today, about 30 minutes ago,  I placed a call to the head of state, and I said that we want this gentleman back.  And with Putin, again, we have little leverage over Russia. 
[02:05:30]  You know, when oil's at a certain price, the Russians just don't care.  When it drops below a certain price, that's when they started listening to us again.  But if we had gone to Russia and said, look, you know, you either give them back, or we're  going to have to kind of rethink parts of our relationship, including this whole missile  defense system in Europe that drives Putin crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, Obama gave that away.  He dropped the whole concept after we got our political allies.  He's not, I'm getting in the weeds on it, to expend their capital with their populations  to sell the idea.  And then Obama says, nah, we don't need this missile defense thing.  So if you went to Putin and said, you know what, we're going to actually take a look at 
[02:06:00]  that whole missile defense thing again.  Give us him back.  Putin would have done it.  I mean, you know.  Would Putin have thought, I'm sorry, I'm good.  No, no, go ahead.  Would Putin have thought that Obama would invest in such a, or have gone for such an amazingly  grand thing over one guy?  Like, would Putin have believed him or called his bluff and said, you're not going to go  for this missile defense over this one idiot?  No, it's a great, no, it's a really good point, because certainly by now, the track record  with the president is, you know, they would probably have called his bluff. 
[02:06:30]  They probably would have thought at this point, no, I don't think he's going to the mat on  this one, because, you know, there's been mixed messages and, you know, confused messages  from the White House and foreign policy for a few years.  Again, I'm sounding real cynical.  I don't mean to be dumping on the White House.  Nah, what are you going to do, right?  But, I mean, it's, you know, the thing's a mess.  And Snowden's, you know, sitting there, and he'll probably, I think, you know, 40 minutes  later after you ask that question, I think he's going to, he's probably going to end up  moving on to Bolivia or somewhere in South America, Central America. 
[02:07:00]  It just seems like if the president really does get involved and puts these ultimatums on  these other leaders, that it puts such an importance on this guy, that you've got to  start thinking, well, why, why is this guy so important?  Why does the president himself want to call in favors to get him back?  What does he know?  How much did get out?  Like, it almost, it's almost embarrassing for the White House to put so much energy to get 
[02:07:30]  him back, because why is it that important?  And why can't he leave the airport?  Like, what is that whole thing about him?  Is he in the Moscow airport?  Yeah.  Oh, he's been there for months, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  He's in the transit zone.  He's got to be bored shitless.  Well, you've got duty-free liquor, right?  Oh, there you go.  An hour in an airport is like 10 hours.  Jesus.  Can you imagine being there for months?  Why can't he?  It's a lifetime.  All you can do is watch CNN, International.  Yeah, International.  Shitty restaurants.  Why can't he leave the airport? 
[02:08:00]  Maybe.  I don't get that whole thing.  Well, because he doesn't have a passport.  They revoked his passport.  Who did the U.S.?  The U.S. did.  So go outside.  Go outside.  Go outside.  Have a smoke.  Walk around.  Suddenly a van will pull up.  Right.  Throw him in there.  He's gone.  Oh, shit.  And people will say, well, how come we just don't grab him?  Right, right.  You can't grab him.  He's on Russian soil, even though they say, the Russians are very funny.  They're saying, hey, we can't, what are we supposed to do?  He's in the transit zone.  We can't do anything about this.  What's the transit zone?  What's that mean?  It's like when you say I'm on my way to Indonesia, and I'm via Frankfurt, so I never actually 
[02:08:30]  leave the transit zone.  It's considered sort of an international safe area, if you will.  Oh, you're between flights.  You're between flights.  You don't go outside of the security.  Right.  And so I'm still in the international transit area.  Right.  Well, you know, when you do a transfer on an airline, you go to the airport, you don't  have to go through security again, because you're there.  So he's got to stay in that limbo area.  He's still in transit, technically, I guess. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  He's still waiting for his flight to take off.  That's hilarious.  Where's he sleeping?  You know what?  I'm sure, because Wikipedia has been providing legal support to him.  Not Wikipedia.  WikiLeaks has been providing support to him, resources and legal support.  Do they give him a little room there?  I think they give him a cot and a hooker or whatever.  A cot in the Russian.  Oh, the Russians want to go.  He's already in prison.  Why do we need him to be in prison?  That sounds awful.  That's actually a good point.  I think it's probably better to be in prison. 
[02:09:30]  Just leave him there.  Yeah.  Airports suck.  They're the worst.  They do suck.  They do suck.  Do you think that any Russians have spoken with him yet?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  The idea that, because this guy, this guy was a classic case of failing upwards, right?  The reason why he was able to get, people say, how did this happen?  How did he get access?  Yeah.  Well, a couple of reasons.  One is, we went, after 9-11, we went from, in the intelligence community, what was referred  to as a need-to-know basis.  Everything's compartmentalized.  If you don't have a need to know about a particular operation, then you don't know about it.  And that's how you keep secrets. 
[02:10:00]  Right, right.  So, but then after 9-11, there was, you know, that big outcry.  Oh, my God.  How could you guys not have been keeping a safe bet?  CIA didn't talk to the FBI.  People were talking.  So it became a sort of a need to share, a need to play well with others sort of thing.  Once you do that, once you say, okay, our goal with all this classified information  is to actually throw it in a big pot, give more people access to it, and make it easier  to move it.  By definition, you're making it easier for somebody like Snowden to grab it all.  So, and the other thing is, he got his clearances when he went to work as a guard at an NSA 
[02:10:30]  facility, right?  So he's a guard.  I mean, that's what he's doing.  He's standing around watching people swipe their badges.  But once you get your clearances in the world of government contracting, you're a pretty  good commodity because any company that has government contracts that needs to fill places  is looking for people with clearances.  With clearances.  And if you've got them, they don't have to pay to get you background investigated and  go through that whole process.  Right.  So it's easier for that person to get a job and then get the next job and get the next  job.  And that's kind of what he was doing until he ends up in a place where he's providing  computer support.  He's like an IT guy, you know, wiping tapes and doing all the crap that, you know, that 
[02:11:00]  has to be done to keep the systems running.  And that gave him the ability to steal all this crap.  How did he steal it?  What, did he just put the drive in and take it?  And how do they know he's doing it?  I think he just made notes.  I don't know how he did.  I mean, is it that easy to do to just put in a fucking, a little fucking, whatever drive  and take it?  Yeah, you'd like to think it'd be more than that.  But, yeah, it was...  Probably shoved it up his asshole.  It was, whatever it was, it was illegal and it was against, I'm sure it was against the 
[02:11:30]  fucking policy of...  Imagine he's on a flight and he's got, like, 28 USB shoved up his ass.  USB shoved up his ass.  He's got to take a dump and he's...  Or one big G-Drive.  I'm too tired by a G-Drive.  But what is he doing right now at the airport?  Yeah, right now.  Where is he right now?  Are people just staring at him?  That would be great.  It's like an exhibit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little room, like, why don't we know this info?  But the Russians are fantastic because they're playing this for all it's worth. 
[02:12:00]  Putin's certainly enjoying this.  And they're just basically saying, look, how can we...  We'd love to help, but how can we help you?  Yeah.  Because he's in the transit zone.  He's not in Russia.  Can't just scoop him up.  Yeah, this would be impossible for us.  It's officially a transit zone, though?  Yeah.  It's not that...  Really?  Yeah.  It's a technicality?  So without a passport, he can't leave because how's he going to, you know...  He has no way to get us.  He doesn't have a visa.  He doesn't have...  So anyway, I think...  So as soon as he walks through security again, then he's fucked.  Well, unless he gets granted temporary asylum by the Russians. 
[02:12:30]  And that's what he's applied for.  So officially no one can touch him in the airport.  Theoretically, that's right.  But the Russians can and would do what they want to do in their own country.  If they wanted to.  They would trick him into walking outside to have a cigarette or something.  If they wanted to help us...  Sorry, how'd they get Bobby Fischer?  They got Bobby Fischer, didn't they?  Now he's still in the transit zone, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He's stuck his playing chess with fucking Snowden.  But in Japan, he got fucking nailed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right?  They were going to extradite him back, and they didn't.  He wound up getting asylum in Reykjavik, enough permanent home in Reykjavik. 
[02:13:00]  But how'd they nail Bobby Fischer for playing a championship chess match in fucking Yugoslavia in 95,  and they can't get this guy?  Because he's only smart at chess.  When it comes to everything else, he's really stupid.  Putin loves alpha-mailing anybody, especially our president, because it's so easy anyway.  But, you know, he's all Mr. Action, out on horseback, shooting.  What a guy.  Swimming.  Swimming.  He loves taking his shirt off.  Yeah.  So you think he'll end up down in Latin America somewhere? 
[02:13:30]  I think so.  Yeah, honestly, can you imagine?  Can you imagine?  This is going to sound really cynical.  People are going to say, oh, you're full of crap.  But can you imagine the political operatives in the White House?  Thinking to themselves, yeah, that's what we want.  We want Snowden back here now, leading up to the midterm elections, with a big trial on the front pages every day,  talking about the NSA surveillance program, pissing off Obama's base, in part because of the program,  in part because now they've got this guy on trial that they consider to be a hero or whistleblower at worst.  And, you know, so I'm honestly of the mindset that the reason why they didn't pick up the phone and make this an issue is because they really don't want to. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, when you think about it, it's Obama's base that is looking at this guy as a hero.  You get the real liberal people, the Occupy Wall Street, the anonymous people.  They look at him like, yeah, he bucked the system and did it.  And so then if you get Obama and his guys crucifying this guy, it doesn't look good.  It's the base.  The optics really bad.  Right.  And you've got this weird thing with the libertarians in the far left now. 
[02:14:30]  I've joined forces in support of Snowden.  It all makes very surreal.  It's so strange.  Well, what happens to his apartment?  Is it just sitting there with all his stuff?  Left like fucking butch in Pulp Fiction.  Right.  Or did the landlord finally say enough and just throw all his stuff out on the curb?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm sure it's taped off.  I'm sure the, you know, it's got to be a weird feeling knowing you can never go home again.  Yeah.  When you think about that. 
[02:15:00]  He has to say goodbye to his life completely.  Everything.  Everything he knows and loves, he's had to say fuck her.  All that's done.  But they don't think, again, going back to people like Hanson and all these characters  that have committed espionage and treason and similar acts over the years, they don't  think like, you know, a normal person would.  They don't sit there and think, well, no, see, now when I get caught, I will have really  fucked over my family, the next generation of my family.  This is what they're going to be known for.  Wow.  Associated with me. 
[02:15:30]  I've betrayed my country.  I've betrayed my age.  Whatever it is.  They don't think that way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I typically just think they're smarter, they're bulletproof, things aren't going to happen  to them.  Right.  They're going to show the world, you know, whatever their motivation is.  I'm just saying, usually their motivation isn't particularly idealistic.  Yeah, it is a very selfish thing.  And that's odd because you would think it's, if you're for him, that it's a very selfless  thing.  That he's, you know, sacrificing himself for the greater good of the people.  Meanwhile, it's more of a me, me, me. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  Look what I can do.  And people want to fuck everyone else.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But people have been saying, oh, he's like the Henry David Thoreau.  Or he's like Martin Luther King.  Are you insane?  I love when they equate people that have nothing to do with the heroes of the past.  Well, let's ask Mike Baker about some other things.  Sure.  You follow him, the Anthony Weiner thing?  I know that's not in your wheelhouse, but.  Following him, he's living it.  He likes a texture.  I love that he's not stepping down.  No, I think it's great.  He makes it so much fun. 
[02:16:30]  I know.  I mean, if he just disappeared, then what good is that?  No, he's, how dysfunctional is that?  The best part of this story, from my perspective, is, I don't know if you saw this news, he went  out and he hired a local New York City private investigations firm when the first part of  this broke, back in whenever it was.  Oh, I did see this.  I read about this.  Before he actually.  He spent like $40,000.  Spent a little over $40,000 to investigate what, you know, what the fuck.  What's going on, right?  The whole time.  Exactly.  They create a story.  Which is creepy, because then you're like, the investigator's going to finally turn to 
[02:17:00]  him and go, it's you, you idiot.  Hey, dummy.  Right?  Yeah.  You guys are smart people.  And that would take about five minutes to find out, right?  And so, and then of course, you'd be happy to give him an invoice for $40,000 after  five minutes of work, you know?  But the point being is, it also looks like.  But people are looking at that like he, this shows how crazy he is that he spent the $40,000.  No, he's trying to cover his ass, obviously.  Right.  And he knew he had to do something, so he's like, oh, fuck, I actually got  to hire an investigator.  He probably, you know, looked for the worst investigator possible in New York City.  Find the worst guy. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  But he had to do that, or people go, why aren't you trying to figure out who's fucking  over here?  Exactly.  Put him in a weird spot.  And then the idea is that there's a potential that he may have spent campaign money to pay  for the investigation.  So that right there is now he's gone over from just being incredibly creepy and doing  things that he's really screwed up to, you know, potentially something really problematic.  Maybe the investigator can also find Nicole's real killer.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That shit.  Oh, really?  That shit.  You're right. 
[02:18:00]  I wouldn't even call him creepy, though.  I really wouldn't.  No.  No, I'm not saying it's nice, but it's not creepy.  He's not messaging children.  He's not talking about rape.  He's just a guy being a pervert.  I mean, creepy.  I mean, no, the creepy part is that he got a second chance.  He fucking blew that.  Right.  He was still doing it while he was doing photo shoots with his wife and his brand new  kid.  Yeah.  That's what makes it fucking.  Right.  And that he won't step down and that he doesn't seem to think that there's a problem with  it.  And he doesn't seem to think it's an issue of character.  Character and judgment.  A lack of good judgment. 
[02:18:30]  Possibly an addiction that he probably should try to get.  Right.  The mayor.  You want a mayor of your city that that shows that he can assess a situation, find the good  and the bad, move toward the good, move.  Yeah.  Not a guy that has such poor judgment that he did this in his personal life.  You can't have that.  But do we even though I know you guys are technically right, it's weird that we put this  little thing on politicians when almost all of them are hunks of garbage. 
[02:19:00]  But if not in a sexual way, then in who they associate, that's why I didn't care about Obama  and Jeremiah Wright.  Because all of them, I mean, yeah, Jeremiah Wright said some lousy stuff.  But is Pat Robertson any better saying that the U.S. was targeted for 9-11 because we support  homosexuality?  They all have shit friends and they're all shit on some level.  Well, so, okay, Spitzer did it.  Wiener did it.  Sanford did it. 
[02:19:30]  We're going to go down the line.  Clinton did it.  Right.  How many of them have been pigs before we finally go, hey, this comes with that job?  Yeah, we were willing to accept the fact he was a pig, but we gave him a second chance  and he was doing okay.  He was leading the polls.  Right.  No, it's honestly, I think you're absolutely right in terms of, we've lowered our expectations  as to what to expect from public servants.  Right.  And in all honesty, I mean, I was sitting around the other day saying, you know, why doesn't  Wiener just go away?  Why doesn't he go, leave?  Go get a job somewhere.  We don't want him to leave.  Please stay. 
[02:20:00]  Let's make it on a radio show.  If we did a due diligence background on Wiener or Spitzer or whomever, and we uncovered  that they were doing whatever behavior it was, you know, hookers or the sexting, the  guy wouldn't get hired by a company.  He wouldn't get hired by a firm.  Right.  And he wouldn't have that chance.  And Spitzer, you know, in this outrage came out and said, yeah, I'd have to fire somebody  like Wiener if he was up for this sort of behavior.  Yeah, yeah.  But you're right.  It's both sides of the aisle.  And the fact that we don't seem to be concerned about consequences anymore, we seem to have 
[02:20:30]  separated the idea that character actually matters for something.  But look, all we have here is the ability to look at someone's record and how they present  themselves and take it at face value on trust.  When they just blatantly fuck up like this and expose themselves to us, all we can really  do is go, well, you screwed up, look, I know they do too, but at least he's hiding it better  than you.  I mean, if you want to be completely cynical about it. 
[02:21:00]  That's where I'm with Jimmy.  And that's, but that's the line we have.  It's the only one we have.  So that's the one we adhere to.  They're all pieces of shit.  Right.  I agree.  But this was in the, you know, in the open.  Big time in the open.  Wide open.  Big scandals used to be.  Yeah.  Now it's kind of like we laugh at them.  We know we're like, look at this guy.  And then they used to go away.  If there was a scandal, the person would say, oh, geez.  And then he would kind of slink away.  This one was going away.  Gary Hart, where did he go?  This one was going away.  I mean, you know. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  No, you're right.  He had the chance.  He had to kind of get his shit together.  He did blow with bad judgment.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  That's a very diplomatic way to put it.  He knew he was going to try to come back and then go for, you know, the mayor of New  York City.  And like you said, he was leading in the polls, which was.  He was leading.  He was at 26%, I believe.  And now he's at 16.  There's still 60% of the people supporting him.  Spitzer.  Is Spitzer leading as comptroller?  Oh, my God.  Is he?  That was the best part when he came out yesterday.  Like, oh, my God.  This guy's way creepier than me. 
[02:22:00]  He's got to drop out.  Hurrah, hurrah.  It's literally the fucking phoniness of people acting like we don't get why he did it.  There's plenty of married men that don't cheat and don't dirty text.  But to act like we don't get it.  Like, oh, can you believe he sent a photo of his penis?  Right.  Of course I can.  Yeah.  When they say it's always the cover up.  It's not the fact that he was sexting.  Yeah.  It's the fact that he spent so much time lying about it.  It's like Ryan Braun.  You know, he gets a 65 game suspension.  You know, not so much because he was dope.  And, you know, who isn't in the league, apparently, at this point. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  He spent all that time lying about it.  That is true.  You tell the truth and people understand, Paula Deen.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  Well, there are certain things the truth.  Yeah.  We do understand why.  Paula Deen shows you.  We understand why people lie to Mike Baker for real.  Because that's not good enough.  People still want to fucking hang you.  There's still rock, paper, scissors with the truth.  Sometimes.  Ooh.  Jimmy's right.  But I think Paula Deen's a good point.  I think there are a couple of subjects out there that you can't fuck with.  Yeah.  And you can't.  You know, so there's no coming back from some things.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Wiener shouldn't be surprised. 
[02:23:00]  He really had a second chance.  Which we do give people.  The sex thing we give people second chances on.  You let a little time go by, you will get a second chance in general.  And he knew that was coming, his second chance.  And that's why, you know, he fucking simply blew it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he got his shit together in time.  Sex, though, people are willing to forgive that after some time.  Yeah.  Which is odd.  But some kind of criminal behavior.  Yeah.  Certain communities will forgive criminal behavior.  That's been proven. 
[02:23:30]  Well, redemption's not a bad, redemption's a good thing, right?  Sure.  But it comes a little cheap nowadays in the States.  We seem to have compressed the time that it takes.  Yeah, yeah.  As long as you get out there, you apologize with your spouse standing next to you.  Yes, yes.  You do a couple of things, and you're good.  Cool, yeah.  You sticking around?  So, you know what?  I got to get going.  For real?  Yeah.  I wish I could stick around, because this is, it's always my favorite morning when I can hang out here.  It's fun, man.  There are a couple of things I want to ask you about.  It really is fun.  We got Dana White coming.  Okay.  Yeah, I'll definitely make space for him.  All right.  You guys will have me back.  When I get the green light to promote the new show. 
[02:24:00]  Absolutely.  Oh, please.  Come on.  I'd love to do it.  I'd love to do it.  Thanks so much.  Yeah, congratulations on the show, Mike.  Thank you, man.  Thanks so much.  We're all big fans.  The show's going to be on the Travel Channel.  It's called American Declassified, but we'll have more details.  Typical of Mike Baker, no real information.  Of course.  Very vague.  You should live in Montreal, Canada.  Once again.  All right, Mike.  Always a pleasure.  Thanks, Mike.  Enjoy Idaho.  We'll have Dana White next.  The OBNC Show. 
[02:24:30]  Very happy to have Dana White back in the studio.  I mean, not.  We just caught up with Dana, and he just gave us amazing shit.  So I guess we don't have to do the interview.  Oh, it was a read?  Yeah.  All right, well, back anyway.  Was that a read?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck it.  Who was it for?  It was for the fine folks of Dish.  Ah, yeah.  People know about Dish.  Good enough.  Good enough to hop or go get it.  Of course. 
[02:25:00]  Don't worry about it so much.  We'll make good on that one.  Dana hasn't been in the studio in a while.  You've been on the phone a bunch of times.  And I was telling Dana off air, and I want to say it on air, that every fighter that has  come through here, they've all been great for us.  Just great.  So you're doing something right.  Because, you know, I'll say it.  Baseball players in general, they're assholes.  We've never had a good time with baseball players.  But every single UFC guy comes in here, gives it, you know, they're all, gives us great 
[02:25:30]  radio every single time.  Well, you know what?  It's funny, because when we got into this sport, you know, we fell in love with the sport.  And then as we started to meet the athletes, I mean, that was really what sealed the deal  for us.  They really are good people.  They're all gentlemen.  They are.  They're great.  They're great people to be around.  They're just, they really are.  They're so, the funny thing is, is there's so many misconceptions about the guys, you know,  in the old days.  But when you meet them, you would never expect these guys.  Not at all.  They're great.  I mean, we're aware that they can rip our heads off, but besides that, they're unbelievable. 
[02:26:00]  The last time I saw you was, I went to the Silva fight, and I saw you there, and what  a fucking, I've never been so shocked in my life at what happened.  It was crazy, wasn't it?  It was, it was, you think you can't be surprised by anything, and I literally stood there with  my fucking mouth open.  But we were talking about that before the show, too, because someone was in here and said  a lot of the fighters said that he had a shot against Silva.  Well, Chael had said that to me.  Right.  Oh, you were the one to say that?  Yeah.  Okay, right.  But you said that Chael said a bunch of the other fighters were also saying, don't assume 
[02:26:30]  that Silva's got this.  Chael said that to me, we saw each other in the restroom, and after complimenting, he  said, like, men will do.  I was like, what do you think?  And he goes, he goes, I'm picking Weidman, and he goes, and a lot of the fighters are  picking Weidman.  Right.  And I had asked Dana about that.  I said, like, hey, Chael, I said that a lot of the fighters are picking Weidman.  Now, do you think they're picking him, or is that like, and what I was saying was, do  you think that these are guys who, like, guys who have lost to him or don't like him,  just kind of want to see?  I was wondering if it was more wishful thinking than anything.  You thought I had heard about some internet conspiracy thing, which I had not heard. 
[02:27:00]  But I was surprised that all these fighters were picking him.  And I'm like, do they just hate Silva and want to see him lose?  Are they really believed it?  Yeah, no, people were saying, because as the lead up for that fight and all these fighters  were picking him, you know, he came back into my locker room that night, and he's  like, come on.  He's like, I mean, all these guys are saying that he thought, you know, I thought you were  saying that, like, we were telling fighters to say, you know, Anderson Silva would win  the fight.  But no, I mean, we don't tell anybody to say that.  They pick what they pick.  And a lot of, I told, I was saying, you know, when he and I were talking off air, that a 
[02:27:30]  lot of the, like George St. Pierre, George St. Pierre absolutely knew that Weidman was  going to win the fight.  He wouldn't even schedule a fight.  Like, no, I'm not going to do a super fight with Anderson because he's not going to win.  Wow.  Yeah, literally what he said.  So he wouldn't even talk about booking a fight.  That's how much he believed in Weidman.  Wow.  Yeah.  See, I thought, I was like, because I heard it from Chael, who I like, but I'm like, Chael has  a thing for Silva.  But I'm like, I wonder if that's just guys wanting to see him fall because they're sick 
[02:28:00]  and tired.  Like, you know what I mean?  If I see a comic who I know is good about to, I'm like, if he bombs, I'm so fucking happy.  Like, I wonder if that's the same.  But man, they knew something.  Because Faber had picked, I think Weidman, a lot of guys picked.  And you don't think Silva's done, right?  No.  Yeah, he's got a few more.  Yeah, the rematch is going to be interesting.  Yes.  You know, obviously, I think if Weidman wins the rematch, you know, maybe Anderson would  retire.  But who knows?  You got to do a Don King and make sure Weidman loses the second fight so he gets the third 
[02:28:30]  fight.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Don't even start that.  That's what everybody...  That'll be the next thing.  Yeah.  It's a no-lose for the UFC in the weird way that, like, if Weidman wins...  Everyone's going to be watching it.  He's legendary.  And if Anderson wins, then it's like, okay, A, you got a third fight.  And B, it's like, oh, okay, he was clowning around.  You sure don't need the third fight.  It would be, you know, if it happens, it happens.  But everyone's going to be watching the rematch.  It's already set up all nice.  Yeah, and you talk about a third fight depending on how the fight goes.  You know what I mean?  It's like everybody...  Anderson Silva's 38 years old.  A lot of people don't realize that. 
[02:29:00]  But if he went out there and looked like, you know, he just showed up and was old all  of a sudden, it'd be one thing.  But he didn't look old.  It's the way that he lost.  He was out there goofing around.  Like, wasn't that crazy in the arena that night?  Like, at first, when he got knocked out, the whole place was in shock.  Like, he said, everybody was sitting there with...  And then the place just went crazy.  Well, I started...  You know, I love Anderson Silva.  And I start...  As I'm watching it, and he's doing that, it looked like fucking...  Weidman had him on the ground in the beginning.  It looked like he was...  I guess I'm going to guess a heel hook or whatever he was going for.  And I'm like, Silva might be in trouble early. 
[02:29:30]  And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?  I'm like, don't listen to him.  I was yelling to Weidman, don't listen.  He's in your fucking head.  I was getting annoyed at Silva for taunting him.  I'm like, man, you better take this guy seriously.  Silva's always been great at that.  I love that about him.  Yeah, Roy Jones Jr. jumped up after the first round and started screaming at me,  this fight's over.  He's in his head.  It's over.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and then that second round came out.  People were going crazy during that fight.  Like, all the people that were on the side of the cage there were going nuts.  Yeah, I couldn't believe... 
[02:30:00]  And I rooted for Weidman in that moment because I got so annoyed at Silva for doing that.  I'm like, what are you doing, man?  This guy's a real fucking problem.  Yeah, I think everybody did.  I mean, even Brazilians that were booing him on the way in were cheering him on the way out.  Wow.  No kidding.  Do you think that's humiliating for Silva to lose that way?  Yeah.  Not just to get beaten by a guy, but to be clowning around like that?  Of course it is, right?  Yeah, that's humiliating to lose, period, that way.  I mean, when you've never lost and you're the best in the world and you get knocked out,  yeah, that always sucks. 
[02:30:30]  It's never fun.  No shit.  That's a tough sleep.  So why did he say no rematch at first and then like a week later or whatever he signs on?  You know, I've dealt with this a lot with guys, especially, you know, Anderson Silva forgot what it's like to lose.  So right when it's over, you're like, yeah, whatever.  And then, you know, it sinks in and reality sets in over the next few days.  And I met with him.  He fought Saturday.  I met with him again on Thursday and he was very ready to fight it.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to go out that way.  No way.  No way. 
[02:31:00]  You got to go.  They give me another shot.  I was asking Dana off air about A-Rod and he started telling me a pretty, pretty great story.  And I said, stop.  I want to hear the rest of it on air.  I just asked you about A-Rod and, you know, what's going on with him.  And then you said that he's like, I didn't want to put words in your mouth.  I said, A-Rod's my man.  He always will be a man.  You know, and I'm a Red Sox fan.  That's not a Yankees thing.  But, you know, I was diagnosed with Meniere's disease, which is basically nerve damage to your inner ear. 
[02:31:30]  How did you get that?  Did you just born with it?  No, you get it from being punched.  You get it from being punched.  You get it from a lot of cops and military guys get it from the shooting and the loud noise from shooting.  A lot of rock stars get it and guys that are in bands get it.  You know, it's basically you do damage to that nerve.  And what it does is the nerve starts telling the brain that you're moving when you're not.  And when you get these attacks, you literally, I'm telling you, you go down like you got shot by a fucking sniper, man.  It's crazy. 
[02:32:00]  You go down.  Do you feel nauseous?  Oh, you puke.  If you don't close your eyes and get in a dark room, you will puke your brains out.  Is it like being like a dizzy feeling?  No, it's it's you start spinning.  The room starts spinning.  Oh, my God.  Radio.  Like your worst.  I'm turning down my headphones.  The worst.  It's the worst thing you could ever imagine.  A lot of people suicide to get it.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's it's it's real bad.  So there's no cure for it.  There's no cure.  They have they try to do things.  You know, there's a surgery where they can put a stent in there. 
[02:32:30]  And I did that surgery.  We saw the video.  Yeah.  That video was horrific.  There's a surgery where they go.  It's basically brain surgery is what it is.  They drill through your skull, get inside there and they insert this tube.  And there's another one where they go even deeper and they cut the nerve itself.  And you have to learn how to walk again.  Geez.  After they cut that nerve.  Oh, my God.  Now, they didn't cut the nerve.  No, I didn't cut the nerve.  I went for the stent.  And it actually actually made me worse.  I went from having attacks every once in a while to having attacks every day. 
[02:33:00]  And then it also gave me tinnitus.  And tinnitus is the constant loud ringing of the ear.  Your ear just rings really loud all the time.  I had that.  That's terrible.  I've gotten the woozy thing, too.  Really?  I've definitely gotten that.  I've been sober?  Yes.  Exactly.  Oh, no.  See, no.  It was from constantly drinking.  Wait a minute.  Sorry.  No, I've gotten that before where I'll be working on something, working on some equipment 
[02:33:30]  downstairs.  And I'll have to go like this, maybe turn sideways.  And whoop!  Like totally disoriented where you're completely spun around.  You've got to, yeah, shut your eyes, go look up, straighten your head out, and then it's  like gone.  But not totally gone, just a little, still a little woozy.  That could be, you know, symptoms of it coming out.  How long ago, when was the last time you had, just me talking to him like I'm a doctor.  So when was the last time you had these symptoms? 
[02:34:00]  This happened fucking for years and years and years on and off.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's terrible.  It could be.  But when you get this, you're down for hours.  Some people are down for days sometimes.  Whoa, whoa, come on.  Yeah, when I would get an attack, I'd be down for nine, ten hours.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  At what point after surgery did you realize, oh my God, it didn't work?  Like how long did it take you to realize, like, fuck it, made it worse?  A couple months.  Oh, a while later.  Okay.  Yeah, well, I knew I was, because after that surgery, you know, recovering from that is  brutal.  To do.  I was still, I literally did that surgery, flew home the next morning, and then flew to 
[02:34:30]  Chicago for the UFC on Fox Chicago fight.  So I kept right on going.  Well, you hit it pretty well, because your work ethic, everyone knows about.  So I can't imagine you being, you know, down and out for nine hours.  Yeah, I was, I was, I was tough and through it, you know, I, but my life, my life, the  year after that happened to me, my life was so different.  I literally couldn't do anything, man.  I was, I was just down and I didn't work out for over a year. 
[02:35:00]  Damn.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I was, it was driving me crazy.  So I was literally at the point where I'd just given up and I said, this is, this is  going to be the rest of my life.  This is, this is my life now.  You know, my quality of life is, is over.  It's, it's just not ever going to be what it was before.  So I get a call from A-Rod and Kobe Bryant had sent him out to Dusseldorf, Germany, his  knee and back.  They do this stuff out there where they, they take your blood and they, they, they do what's 
[02:35:30]  called spinning.  And, and I'm, I'm no doctor, so I can't really explain exactly what they do, but they take  your blood, they incubate it, they spin it.  And then they, they, they give you, they inject it back into you 10 hours later.  And I got the injection on Sunday.  I flew back to Vegas from Germany and, uh, that was, that was Sunday.  I landed, I went to bed, got up, I had to fly to Stanford.  I spoke at their business school on Monday, you know, and I didn't really feel any different.  Flew back home, worked a little, went to bed, woke up Tuesday morning and felt like fucking 
[02:36:00]  Superman.  I'm not kidding you, man.  I felt like, I felt like I could fly to work.  I could have flew to work that Tuesday.  And from that day on to right now, my life has been exactly the same as it was before  I had the surgery.  How long ago is this that you got the final?  I've had, so what happens is when you fly out there, they take so much blood for, it's  funny because they're sitting there and they're like, uh, do you have a problem, you know, 
[02:36:30]  giving blood or whatever?  I said, no, it doesn't bother me at all.  So I'm sitting there, the girl sticks the needle in me.  I'm like, God damn, that hurt.  This chick doesn't know what she's doing.  I look down, they got a Slurpee straw in my frigging arm.  The needle is so big and the blood just flies out of your arm and they literally fill up  three Fiji bottles, you know, that size, you know, full of blood.  And it literally takes, you know, 30 seconds to fill this whole thing up.  They banded your arm up. 
[02:37:00]  I had a huge bruise.  This whole inside of my arm became, you know, yellow, black and blue and purple, you know.  And, uh, and you, you know, then you go hang out in your hotel, kick around Düsseldorf,  Germany for, for 10 hours and you go back and they give you the shot.  And wait, no, they incubate some of your blood, obviously, not all of them, but they just  take that much of your blood and they incubate it and they do something to it.  All of it.  Because they, they end up making with the blood they take, they end up making two shots.  It concentrates down to a certain amount.  Yeah.  Two little shots. 
[02:37:30]  Two shots.  Super shots.  Yeah.  And what's in those shots?  Just your blood?  Yeah.  Your blood.  And I can't remember what it's called.  I'll get you the book.  Yeah.  I'll get you the book so you can check it out.  But now Jimmy wants his dog.  Well, here's the thing.  The thing is the, here's their philosophy out there is that as we get older, everything  that we have, including some of these diseases that are out there, um, like Parkinson's and  other things are due to inflammation.  Inflammation is what starts to break us down from arthritis to joint pain to even they said  what was giving me the attacks with the nerve was inflammation. 
[02:38:00]  Inflammation starts to get the nerve irritated and it's just, I'm telling you guys, it's amazing.  So, so the crazy part about this is you have to be referred to these guys.  You can't just go out there.  You have to be referred.  So A-Rod refers me.  I fly out there and my life's been different ever since.  It's, it's unbelievable, right?  So you didn't have to go back, right?  It was that one trip?  I flew back.  I went back twice.  I flew back three months later and got the second shot.  So I did two shots.  I did the first one, flew back three months later and got the second one.  Oh, when they incubate it down, they incubate it down to two shots and they hold one 
[02:38:30]  for three months?  Oh, they don't give you both.  Yeah.  Okay.  And the blood that they do is good for six months.  So you got six months to get back there to get the second shot.  I felt so good.  I said, fuck it.  I'm going out there.  I was going to fly back the next week and do it.  So I went out there and got it done.  And the funny part of this story is, you know, when you look at who they've helped that, you  know, George Clooney apparently couldn't lift his shoulders up over his head.  Clooney's been out there.  Pope John Paul couldn't kneel anymore. 
[02:39:00]  So Pope John Paul did it and it started, it started to, you know, he had Parkinson's disease  and I guess they get tremors or whatever their attacks are.  He was having no attacks before he passed away eventually.  Uh, and then, uh, you know, golfers, uh, Kevin Durant from OKC, every soccer player out in  Europe and the list goes on of all these people that, that, that they do leave.  Wow.  So you think about healthcare here in the United States, right?  And, and, you know, all they want to do here is cut you and put you on pills. 
[02:39:30]  They don't really fix anything.  They just sort of mask all the problems.  These guys are out there actually curing people in Germany.  It's the level of, uh, of, of, uh, medicine there and the level of medicine here is night  and day.  Why don't they bring it to the States?  It's illegal here.  I have no idea.  If it's working for people.  Here's the craziest part.  Let me get to this part.  Right?  So Clooney, all these actors and actresses and, and, and, uh, athletes and all these people.  The one thing I never asked is how much does this cost? 
[02:40:00]  Right?  I didn't give a shit.  I just wanted to get out there.  And if this thing was going to work for me, I'm in.  Right?  So I get out there and the other thing, the attention, you get there the first day you  get there, they do this full MRI of your, your body, your brain, your spine, everything.  And the doctor literally sits with you and goes organ by organ and tells you, you know,  what's going on with you and looks at all your stuff.  And then, then I went in and saw an ear, nose, and throat specialist.  Then I saw the doctor who does the, the actual blood work. 
[02:40:30]  And I mean, I must've saw four doctors and they spent hours with me over a two day period.  Oh man.  Right?  Yeah.  So you're thinking, you know, holy shit.  So he goes, finally, he goes through the whole last thing and they're about to take my blood.  And he says, any other questions?  And I'm like, yeah.  How much does this cost?  What's this going to cost?  And he goes, eh, we'll take care of that at the end.  I go, eh, I'm kind of curious and would like to know right now.  So we, we, we, he says, hold on.  He goes in the other room, comes back 7,500 euros. 
[02:41:00]  That's it?  That's 10 grand.  Yeah.  7,500 euros.  Wow.  That's not, so this isn't something that, right.  That, that it's only for the super wealthy can go there and get them.  Anybody could do it.  If you have, if, especially anybody who has Meniere's disease, only people who have Meniere's disease know what it's like to go through it.  And, and, and anybody would come up with 10 grand.  If you had to take a loan out to go get your life back, you would do it.  And then, you know, they're helping people with Parkinson's. 
[02:41:30]  The first guy I called when I landed in the States was Freddie Roach.  I told Freddie Roach, Freddie, I'm telling you, go, go try this thing, man.  I don't know if he's done it, but I set him up to do it.  I don't know if he has.  So have you had a tax since?  No.  Nothing.  No.  Wow.  That's a miracle.  I am healed, man.  I'm like 100%.  My life, and that whole time that I was going through it, you can't eat salt.  You're not allowed to drink alcohol.  You can't, there's a lot of things that, that will aggravate it.  I've been eating salt and drinking plenty of alcohol and I'm, I'm, I'm good. 
[02:42:00]  One last question.  Do you have to go back to keep it up or you're good, good?  Yeah.  Well, what they said is, you know, obviously ride this thing.  First of all, when I went there, they didn't know if it would help me or not.  It wasn't like, oh yeah, this is definitely going to help you.  Yeah.  They didn't know if it would or not.  And they said, but I'll tell you what, we'll give this.  We'll give this thing a shot.  We'll see how it goes.  And, um, they, they said people that had, that they had, um, uh, you know, done who  had Meniere's disease had less than one, had less than one attack a month after, you 
[02:42:30]  know, doing this thing.  So they, they don't give you any guarantees.  They don't say, oh, this is a magic pill.  Spend your 7,500 euros and this is going to work.  Good for you.  We have no idea.  We'll see.  Good for you.  But after your second treatment, do they say, like you said the first one, they say, okay,  you got to come back in three months.  But after that second one, is there a timeframe where they say, now we see how it goes?  Yeah.  Now we play it by ear.  Just write it out.  If anything starts to happen to you again, call us.  We'll get you back in and we'll, we'll do it again.  And how much time since your second one?  It's been a while now.  I don't know how long.  Oh no, no, no.  It's been, it's been seven or eight months. 
[02:43:00]  So if worst case scenario, if you got to go once or twice a year, you, you've gotten  your life for once or twice a year, which is pretty fucking amazing.  It's amazing.  And it's annoying that they won't do it here.  There's probably some garbage FDA excuse because like you said, they want to keep you on pills.  And if this is wiping stuff out, not only that, uh, and, and you can blame the FDA,  but you also got to blame all the fucking litigious United States that we have.  So the FDA passes this through, it goes through somebody sues and now, you know, yeah, it's  all about that.  So they need, they need every little stamp of approval from the FDA. 
[02:43:30]  So they don't.  So go to Germany, enjoy yourself.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Seriously.  It's true, man.  You know, this place is open seven days a week.  They said weekends.  It's just packed with Americans.  Well, everyone is calling.  They're like, give us the website, the place.  Everyone wants to book a trip.  I do.  Well, you got to be referred for this one.  Yeah.  You have to be referred to them.  Yeah.  And that's the only place in the world they do it.  That's the only place I know of.  And that's where everybody's going, you know, and there's places here in the United States 
[02:44:00]  because people have said, oh, they do the same thing in the United States.  No, they don't.  Trust me.  It's not the same.  You think, you know, all these actors and athletes are flying to Dusseldorf, Germany,  because they're doing the same thing here in the United States.  Beverly Hills somewhere.  But that's what they're doing.  So what's happening now is this place in Germany is opening all these places.  They have a place in Beverly Hills.  So you go to the place in Beverly Hills.  They do all the testing there.  They test you.  They do all the MRIs.  And then they fly you to Dusseldorf to do the shots.  So you don't have to do all that stuff there. 
[02:44:30]  Did Kobe and A-Rod get this done for their injuries?  Yeah.  Tons of guys have.  And did it make A-Rod hit the ball better?  Well, no.  It's not about hitting the ball better.  It's about his knee and his back were messed up.  Right.  Yeah.  And that's what these guys specialize in.  That's what they really do.  Their joint and, you know, bones and things like that is what they do.  Inflammation in general.  Yeah.  But as they continue to do more studies, they're finding out that inflammation is the cause to a lot of our problems as we get older. 
[02:45:00]  So how do we knock down our inflammation?  You fly to Dusseldorf.  But there's nothing else we could do with supplements or anything else we could do now?  I don't think so.  Damn.  It's part of, you know, the human structure.  We start to get older.  Right.  That's what happens to us.  We start to.  Wow.  I'm emotionally inflamed.  Yeah.  Rogan's going.  Rogan's got back problems and Rogan's going out there.  I got him set up.  It works on apes.  He's trying to have the fucking, the hair on.  He wants to have his arms raised. 
[02:45:30]  He's human like a fucking savage.  I watch him walk around with his chain wallet and I'm like, am I competing genetically with this guy?  I know.  Horrifying.  Fucking Joe is the best, man.  Yeah.  We love Joe, man.  Totally.  He's a fucking great.  I'm seeing him doing his podcast.  You see his show now?  His show just aired last Wednesday.  No, Thursday, right?  Is it Thursday?  I want to.  On sci-fi.  1.3 million viewers.  Oh, good job.  Oh, wow. 
[02:46:00]  His first episode.  Yeah.  A lot of UFC people.  So his second episode airs this week.  Yeah, he's a blast.  And he raises really, and he's a really good talker.  Like, I listen to his podcaster when he calls.  And phoners are hard to do.  And Joe is just a good talker about whatever you want to discuss.  He's really great on the phone.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  When I say good talker, I don't mean good bullshitter.  I mean, he's just a great conversationalist.  Yeah.  As opposed to me who just stopped the show by making really an unimportant  observation.  You'll have fun with his podcast.  I love his podcast.  He's going to try to get you high, though. 
[02:46:30]  Nah, he knows I don't.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He's going to try, though.  He did it to me.  He did it to me, too.  Did he really?  First time in, I couldn't even tell you, 15 years, I think?  Yeah.  And he's blowing smoke in my face, and I finally took a baby hit.  I'm not going to, like, overplay this.  I took a baby hit.  But it set me off.  I was like, wow, this isn't bad.  I don't mind this.  What do you like high?  I can't picture Dana White high.  I don't know.  I'm never high.  He's trying, you know, he says, I have the cure for your Meneers.  He's right here.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  I'm sure that's going to make me feel wonderful.  So you got the big press conference at 1 o'clock today, man.  Yeah.  Is all those guys going to be there?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, yesterday, we were in L.A. yesterday afternoon, and basically we're doing this world  tour because never in the history since we've owned the UFC has the end of the year spent  so bad ass.  This Saturday night on pay-per-view is the Korean Zombie versus Jose Aldo.  That fight.  That's going to be a great fight.  Where is that taking place?  Down in Brazil. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, he's okay.  Then we got Ben Henderson, you know, coming up after that at the end of August is Ben  Henderson versus Anthony Pettis.  Then we have Jones versus Gustafsson.  And the big beef with Jones is that he's too big for the 205-pound division.  You know, oh, it's unfair.  He's too big.  He's this.  He's that.  Gustafsson's an inch bigger than he is.  Wow.  So there you go.  Jeez.  Then in October, we have the best trilogy we've ever had in UFC history with Kane  Velasquez versus Junior Dos Santos. 
[02:48:00]  And when I say that, Kane Velasquez got knocked out in the first round by Junior Dos Santos  in the first fight.  Kane annihilated Junior Dos Santos in that second fight.  And now here comes the third fight.  Although I'll say for that second fight, I was amazed because I think Kane won five rounds  to none.  I really was amazed that Junior did not get knocked out.  He's a tough dude, man.  He looked like an alien after that fight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looked like I would have looked after Kane beat him up.  But he did not get knocked out. 
[02:48:30]  And it went the distance, which I was amazed at.  But then in November, we have Johnny Hendricks versus George St. Pierre, which many people  believe is like the Anderson Silva fight, that Johnny Hendricks is the guy who could actually  end the reign of George St. Pierre.  And then to end the year in December, we have the rematch with Weidman and Anderson Silva.  And the co-main event of that is Ronda Rousey and Misha Tate.  So we literally took all these guys on the road and we're doing this world tour with  them and basically because my philosophy has always been everybody wants to watch a great 
[02:49:00]  fight, but you got to know the great fights on.  So normally we just go from fight to fight to fight.  So we're doing this world tour with all these all these champions and all these big fights  to end the year.  And then we'll start promoting them one by one as they start to come.  You had a good night on Fox, I thought, too, with fucking Demetrius Demetria.  How awesome was that fight?  Those fucking flyweights are just unbelievably entertaining.  Yeah.  And how about there's, you know, that was, he broke the record. 
[02:49:30]  That was the latest finish ever in a title fight in UFC history.  How much time was in the fifth round?  A minute something left.  And he had just got his nose blasted in the fourth round.  You see that?  His nose was just smashed.  And he could have just rode out that fifth round.  He goes for an arm bar with a guy who's super dangerous.  And, you know, and getting in that position with a minute something left is pretty ballsy.  Wow.  Yeah.  So he pulls off the submission.  And I was, I mean, the Rory McDonald fight, who I love Rory McDonald because I truly think 
[02:50:00]  he looks like a psychopath.  He's a frightening guy.  And him against fucking Jake was not, you know, it wasn't the most exciting fight.  But it was like Rogan pointed out because two guys were being a little overcautious and  respecting each other too much.  You know, neither one wanted to commit and get fucking pummeled hammered.  See, I disagree with that.  What happened that night was Ellenberger wasn't on.  He didn't do anything to try to win that fight.  He threw five punches in the first two rounds. 
[02:50:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  So the third round, he, you know, he tried to push it a little bit more.  He didn't do anything.  And then Rory didn't do anything to try to take advantage of the fact that Ellenberger  basically didn't show up that night.  Do you think Rory was just trying to outpoint him knowing he had the fight?  Yeah, he knew he could stay on the outside and pick him apart and win an easy fight.  And that shit drives me crazy.  Oh, yeah.  I bet.  Do you think Henderson, you know, I know Johnny, it's like, I like him.  He's like a big fucking left hand. 
[02:51:00]  But it seems like against St. Pierre, man, it's almost like when you get into the thing  where you have one thing that everybody looks for, which is like, you know, like Dan Henderson,  as great as he is, has that right hand that everybody looks for.  Or Fedor had that big right, it seems like it's hard for those guys to become champion  because everybody, like with Roy Nelson recently, you know, that giant overhand right is coming.  And if you could avoid that.  Well, I think the difference in this fight is that the biggest problem that people have  with George St. Pierre is his wrestling. 
[02:51:30]  And, you know, this kid is a great wrestler.  And you remember the Condit fight?  The Condit fight was sick.  That was a fucking amazing fight.  Unbelievable.  And that's the way Johnny Hendricks fights.  You know, there's going to be, they asked yesterday at the press conference in L.A.,  they asked Johnny Hendricks, well, with this Roy McDonald thing that happened over the weekend,  you know, George St. Pierre fights the same exact way.  He uses that jab.  And, you know, in his length, what are you going to do about it?  And he goes, well, let me tell you what.  The difference between, you know, what you saw last Saturday and what you'll see in my fight 
[02:52:00]  is I'll take a jab all day long to land that big right hand.  You know what I mean?  So he's saying every time George St. Pierre throws, he's going to blast away.  And then if they start wrestling, he's a great wrestler too.  So that is a fun fight.  Were you surprised?  I was very surprised that Nelson lost the way he did.  I mean, he's out-pointed.  You can't knock him out.  But it just seemed like he was tired and sluggish.  And it was like, fuck, I wanted to kind of see him get a title shot.  A lot of times guys who, you know, guys who beat Roy Nelson all day long are guys who can box. 
[02:52:30]  Guys who can stay on their feet and box.  And, you know, those are the type of guys that beat.  Remember what Junior Dos Santos did to him?  You know, guys who can box and have good footwork can pick Roy Nelson apart.  Although I do think Cain Velasquez is.  And, you know, with all due respect to Silva, I think Cain Velasquez is the best fighter in the UFC.  I mean, because, again, he's such a big tank and his cardio is amazing and he's fast and he can wrestle.  He's just frightening. 
[02:53:00]  He is.  He's the baddest dude in the world.  He really is, right?  Yeah.  Like, after Dos Santos, I mean, how about him against, I mean, Mark Hunt I had higher hopes for.  Mike Hunt?  Hey, would you blow me?  Do you need to ask, Ed?  But the other, who else did I want to see fight him?  Fucking, Cormier, Daniel Cormier.  Yeah.  Cain Velasquez is one of these guys that when he gets you down on the ground, all he does is just keep imposing his will and just doing damage, man. 
[02:53:30]  He doesn't stop.  He just keeps going until he smashes you and you quit.  Well, I think that the fights you have coming up are absolutely amazing and I'm probably going to go to this thing today.  Are you really?  I think so.  Yeah, it's at the Beacon.  You shouldn't mention it.  It's at the Beacon Theater.  It's open to the public, too.  Beacon Theater.  1 o'clock.  Yes, 1 p.m.  The big press conference.  Who's going to be there today?  Let me see.  It's going to be, obviously, Dana.  Oh, John Jones will be there.  Cain. 
[02:54:00]  St. Pierre.  Ronda Rousey.  Fucking Junior.  Alexander Gustafsson.  Johnny Hendricks.  And, of course, Misha Tate will all be the Jesus.  That's an amazing lineup.  Yep, the whole crew will be there today.  So, it was awesome.  We did L.A. yesterday.  The place was packed.  Tons of fans showed up.  It was good.  People were going crazy.  So, if you're not doing anything or, you know.  I don't think you have to promote it.  Leave work today and come on down.  A lot of people are going to be at the Beacon Theater.  1 o'clock.  I'd like to be introduced to Misha Tate.  Yeah?  I like her. 
[02:54:30]  Do you have a gentleman friend?  She does.  You can't hit on a girl in the UFC.  What do I have to offer?  Please.  Because Ronda Rousey was in and she was very conversational.  And someone was like, hey, you want to.  She was great.  What am I going to say to her?  Yeah.  Hi, you want to go to the beach and be embarrassed by me?  Well, we got to take a break.  We actually got Anna Gunn coming in, too.  Yes.  If you want to stick around, you're more than welcome, Dana.  It's up to you, bro.  Yeah, she's one of the co-stars of Breaking Bad.  Breaking Bad.  Oh, yeah.  Everybody talks about that show, man. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, it's huge.  Like, everybody's addicted to that show.  It's huge.  Oh, wait.  It was your birthday today?  It was my birthday yesterday or the day before.  July 28th.  Whenever that was, that was my birthday.  I don't feel bad knowing if you don't.  Bob Kelly has texted and he said it was Dana White's birthday.  You should say hi, birthday.  So happy birthday, man.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  That's great.  Yes.  All right.  Cool, man.  We're going to continue maybe with Dana White, maybe not.  We'll see what happens.  Thanks.  This is the OpenA3 Show. 
[02:55:30]  We got Anna Gunn walking into the studio. 
[02:56:00]  Hi, Anna.  Take a seat.  Make yourself comfy.  Thank you.  We're actually on the air.  Do you mind if I eat a little bit?  Oh.  Eat.  Go ahead.  You sure?  Are you hungry?  I'm kind of hungry.  I'm a little hungry.  She's a beautiful woman.  I don't know.  I'm eating in front of her.  Look how matters.  Bright orange.  I wanted to, you know, wake you guys up a little. 
[02:56:30]  Well, that you did.  We're awake.  That you did.  Thank you.  Of course, Skylar.  Hello.  From Breaking Bad.  I mean, I've been fully immersed in the show for, since the beginning.  And what do you, what do you say?  Because I got to bring up, everybody seems to want you dead on the show.  Not everybody.  Not everyone.  Only those who, you know, who identify with. 
[02:57:00]  Go ahead.  I just say it's a tribute to your acting.  Thank you.  Because, you know, sometimes it's like, oh boy, she's kind of getting in the way of things.  That's what it is.  I think it's the people who really identify with Walt.  And, you know, that's the point of the show.  I mean, that's what's brilliant about the show.  People really get behind the story of Walt.  And they get behind the idea of a guy who's been really pushed down by life.  And disappointed.  And has had to take a lot of things that he didn't want in life. 
[02:57:30]  And I think that Vince wrote him so brilliantly.  And Brian plays him so brilliantly.  Yeah.  That people root for him and they cheer for him.  And he is both the protagonist and the anti-hero at the same time.  Yeah.  So it's such a brilliant construct.  And then, in a way, Skylar is kind of the antagonist.  Because she's the one who stands in the way of him doing whatever he wants to do, most of all. 
[02:58:00]  Right.  And that makes some people kind of pissed off.  Yeah.  Because, like, the viewers, they see someone like Walter kind of progress through the show from this schleppy kind of guy.  Right.  And very realistically and gradually, he turned almost out of necessity for every instance of evil that he does.  Yeah.  It's almost like, well, he wouldn't do that.  And then, well, I guess he has to now.  Right.  Kind of gets caught up in it. 
[02:58:30]  I've never seen a character so bad that people root for.  I know.  So much.  And, yeah, you get in there, the voice of reason to a point.  And people are like, hey, get out of his way.  I know.  What are you doing?  Exactly.  It's really bizarre.  And we were at first, the writers and Vince and I were like, what is going on?  Why are people so upset?  Yes.  But it really is.  I think it's really about that.  That they just want him.  They put themselves in him and in his corner so much. 
[02:59:00]  And she is the one more than, I mean, even more than the villains in the show, like Gus  Spring or, you know, or Tuco or any of those really bad guys who for a while were bigger  threats than anybody else.  She's the consistent one who says, this is not okay.  You can't do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's the one who kind of stands there and says there are consequences, there are  repercussions.  And that makes people upset psychologically.  It really gets in there and does something to them. 
[02:59:30]  And it's kind of brilliant that it's kind of brilliant.  It's amazingly brilliant.  Yeah.  Because again, as a, as a viewer, you almost want to see how far Walter is going to go  without somebody holding him back.  Exactly.  So you sit there and go like, oh God, Scott, they're getting in it again.  I know.  Why make him stop?  Don't, you know.  But isn't that what kind of prevents us from becoming like a cartoon of somebody is the  fact that in real life you do have people in your way or you do have people in your  ear.  And it's like, without that, then all of a sudden it's just like a, it's like a Superman. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  Like how, how would the, he would just go off the rails and I think it would become,  you know, kind of ridiculous.  And I think Vince knew that.  Yeah.  And the other thing was that Vince from the beginning, he said, I don't want you, like  whenever I'm a pretty emotional person and I'm a pretty, you know, I play, I'm very,  emotions are very much on the surface for me.  So when I first found out for, for example, about his cancer diagnosis, tears jumped to  my eyes.  And Vince very specifically said, Skylar is not a person where emotions come to her easily. 
[03:00:30]  They're very, they're, they're, they're deeply buried in her.  So it was important for him, for her to be a really, really kind of strong, steely person.  Yeah.  And that's what he wanted from her.  And again, that also sometimes makes people feel like, I don't know if I like that because  they think bitch.  Yeah.  And that word gets thrown around and that's a little tough, you know, that's a little  tough to handle because you think, why is that bitchy? 
[03:01:00]  She's actually just a kind of formidable, strong person.  And why is it bitchy to just be strong and to stand toe to toe with a man and say, it's  not okay.  It's, it's so odd to have a show where a lot of the before Waltz, uh, getting into making  meth wasn't shown, but you could see the result of what your lives were during all those years  of him just being the teacher, you being the housewife and mother. 
[03:01:30]  And you could see without even having to show it what it produced and set it up so we could  get into the, you know, the unbelievable craziness of, uh, what, what happened.  Did you have a backstory that you had to kind of, here's what your life was?  Yeah.  I mean, Brian and I talked a lot about it because there wasn't much there, but we  really kind of created this idea of what drew these people together.  And certainly there was, we felt a real attraction and a love between them, but we thought the 
[03:02:00]  thing that probably was the, the biggest attraction between them was their intellect.  I think Skylar is as smart as Waltz, as, as intellectually smart as he is, she is his  equal in that.  Right.  And so, and it's also both, it's their downfall as, as human beings, really.  I mean, they think they're kind of smarter than everybody else.  Than everyone else.  Well.  You know, so that's why in a way as the show goes on, they become almost like the Macbeths 
[03:02:30]  in a way, because they think that they can outsmart everybody else.  They think they can create these lies and these scenarios.  To a point, they have been, I mean, you know, obviously things changed with the, the last  half of the last season coming up.  This is it, obviously.  Yeah.  I was, I was so lucky.  I got an advanced copy of the first episode of this.  Did you?  I loved it.  Don't worry.  No spoilers, people.  That was nice of you to put it online, too.  Yeah, you're right. 
[03:03:00]  People are saying that.  They're like, come on, put that up online.  And I'm like, you don't think I want another one, maybe, at some point?  Exactly.  Be like, here's another one.  I am not saying anything.  But it, it is totally in line with everything that, the magnificence that's been the show  up till now.  The beginning kind of showing you a little advanced view of things, because they've done  that before in the past.  And, um, and then the way, the way Walter, the character, Walter can explain something 
[03:03:30]  to somebody in a way that is so soft and yet just punches you in the face.  Is, uh, and obviously, you know what scene I'm talking about.  It's just because he pulled those shenanigans with you in one episode where it's like, Hey,  you know, you best, you best know who you're talking to kind of a thing.  Exactly.  Exactly.  When he does that thing where he's, he's talking to you and you're, you're drawn into  him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you, you think, Oh, okay. 
[03:04:00]  He's really saying something sincere.  Yeah.  He's going to apologize or he's going to show any regret and no.  Yeah.  It's pretty much a threat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  You're starting to lean into him thinking, Oh my gosh, he's so sincere.  And then all of a sudden he turns it and he does that thing, you know, with his eyes  when he gets all Heisenbergian where he suddenly does this, he gets Heisenbergian and he does  that little thing with his eyes where all of a sudden, and even acting with him, cause  I, you know, obviously I know Brian really well and he's a great guy and he's funny and, 
[03:04:30]  and, and sweet and lovely.  But all of a sudden he does this thing where his eyes just narrow and they get hard and  even acting with him is a little bit like, I'm, I'm going to back up a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just going to take a little, take a little step back.  He's a, he is an amazing actor to pull this role off also.  And then we've had him in before and I was talking to him about how it's so odd to see  a little bit.  He denied it, but you could see it when he's kind of, cause there are parts that are actually 
[03:05:00]  funny in the show.  Oh yeah.  And it's almost part of that Malcolm in the middle, dad, a little bit of that comes through  uh, absolutely at times.  And I think that's, I don't know him, but I would assume he's kind of like that in real  life.  He is.  He's got a great sense of humor.  He's got a great sense of humor and those long, intense scenes that we had to do together,  you know, those are, those are pretty rough to keep up for 12 hours a day.  So there was a lot of laughing and pranks and jokes.  I wouldn't doubt it. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  And you were both in Seinfeld.  We were both in Seinfeld.  We were, we have that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dr. Watley.  And, uh, exactly.  And you were in the one with the, uh, glasses, George's glasses and, uh, he had the wrong  glasses and insisted that it was, um, Jerry's, uh, cousin.  That's right.  Kissing somebody.  Yeah.  And it turned out to be the, the, um, police, police woman kissing her horse.  Exactly.  Oh, okay.  He kept saying, but my cousin looks like a horse.  Yeah.  It was the best. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, it was fantastic.  I watched the show all the time.  So anybody that's on Seinfeld, I'm just like, ah, it's the best.  Fantastic.  How do you feel, uh, with the show ending?  That's gotta suck.  It's really bittersweet.  I mean, this, this, we wrapped in late March and we all had a good cry, but we knew that  we were going to have this kind of farewell tour in a way.  And so we knew we were going to have all this time to spend together.  But now that this is actually coming to an end, we've had some panels.  We had a New York times panel last night and we all kind of started tearing up and a little 
[03:06:30]  bit of crying in public now because it really is coming to an end.  And we know that this time together is truly coming to an end.  And that's, that's hard because this has been the luckiest job of all of our careers.  We know that.  And it's fantastic that you could take, um, I guess five seasons ends up being, uh, and  not, and stop it where people want more. 
[03:07:00]  Obviously people want this to continue, but to make that commitment to know this is what  it is, is, uh, it's brave.  It's very brave.  It's brave because obviously you could milk a show until there's nothing left.  They do it all the time.  Yeah.  Um, but it, it seems like the perfect length for this to turn around and, and from talking,  wouldn't six seasons be the perfect?  Ah, six.  One more.  One more.  Just one more.  One more.  It's sort of like it is six because five is drawn out. 
[03:07:30]  Five and a half.  Five and a half.  It's almost like six.  I know that just from having done like, like little teeny episode work and stuff, you get  attached to people quickly.  Like you form a weird bond with people you do.  See, if you're there for more than one day, it's like you see each other craft services  and you're like, all of a sudden like, Hey, your pals, they go on to much bigger things  and they feel no connection, but I can't, but I can't imagine doing season after season  with the same people and then having to call it quits.  It's a rough way to, it's rough. 
[03:08:00]  It's true.  But the last day when I wrapped, Brian and Aaron and I had a group hug and there was a  little bit of crying, but then Brian said, you know, just think in six months, we won't  remember each other's eyes.  There was a great scene with you guys when Aaron was eating over the house.  That was the best scene.  That was one of the greatest scenes.  How uncomfortable you guys made it.  It was so great.  He's just babbling about something.  He's babbling about something.  And you're just so angry. 
[03:08:30]  So angry, guzzling my wine.  Yeah.  Just drinking at that point.  And, uh, but everything fits so well.  The writing is done so well, uh, on that show.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  And I loved an Aaron looks, he's sitting in between us.  Like he's the uncomfortable kid between the few parents, just looking at us like, Oh God,  I wish it was anywhere else in the world.  We had to stop ourselves from cracking up the entire show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he ate so many green beans that at the end of that scene, he said, I'm never  going to eat a green bean again. 
[03:09:00]  Oh really?  A few takes?  Yeah.  Quite a few.  Now, are you, have you looked at other scripts and stuff since this ended or like?  Yeah.  I'm getting a lot of really interesting, um, scripts.  I'm looking at a lot of movie scripts right now.  And I, I went to, uh, the Sundance Institute this summer and I did the director's lab and  I did this really interesting role that was kind of like a female Walter White kind of  character.  Yeah.  It's the psychological portrait of the making of a zealot and it's a, but it's the, the  female kind of version of that.  So that was really interesting. 
[03:09:30]  So hopefully we'll get that made this year.  Yeah.  So you want to do a movie as opposed to, would it be hard to do something episodic right  now?  Cause you're just coming off this.  Yeah.  I mean, I, I'm looking at some, some television stuff as well, but I'm really interested in  doing some, some film and I'm also a big theater girl.  So I'm looking at some theater projects as well.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's amazing what can be done, um, off of network television.  And that's why I would assume it's probably hard to be offered something on a network where  it's like, you know, I was just able to read dialogue that was so realistic and, and to 
[03:10:00]  go to episodic, um, network television has got to be rough.  Yeah.  I mean, this is some of the best writing that any, any of us have ever encountered.  And, and when you come off of writing like this, it's, the bar is so high.  So we're, I mean, it's just so lucky, but then you're kind of spoiled.  So you have to choose carefully.  So, um, but, but it's opened a lot of doors for all of us.  So we're in, we're in a good place. 
[03:10:30]  Now, obviously, you know, you can't tell us anything.  Um, I'm going to tell you.  So nice.  Um, all of a sudden Vince Gilligan comes.  Yeah, yeah, you will be quiet.  Yes.  Um, uh, would there, let's say, would there be any even possibility there could later be  a reunion of sorts?  I think that's possible for sure.  I mean, it depends on, you know, what happens in the last day. 
[03:11:00]  Yes, exactly.  Who's still standing and all that.  But, you know, there is talk about the Saul Goodman spinoff, so.  Yes, who is a great, another just great character.  Amazing.  A little comic relief in there.  Exactly, yeah.  He's, uh, he's good.  And by the way, he was in a Seinfeld episode.  He was.  Another Seinfeldian.  I just, and if you think I'm bad, our producer, Travis, ten times worse than me.  He can quote all of them. 
[03:11:30]  My father can quote every Seinfeld episode.  It's just that, talk about another just brilliant show for the time and everything.  I know.  Yeah, but they went more than five seasons.  You see, you can make it.  Oh, yes.  Nine seasons.  Yes, they did.  They did.  Well, I guess for the comedy, it's a little bit easier than with an actual drama with a  real story.  Yeah, you just keep going.  You don't have to worry.  I thought, uh, the scene, uh, the episode where Jerry becomes a meth dealer, uh, was  correct.  It was, uh, that would be interesting.  Maybe you guys could all, like, do something together as a cast, but just a totally different 
[03:12:00]  story.  Oh, my, could you imagine?  You know what?  Somebody said that at the New York Times thing.  They said, seeing you all sitting up there, it's a shame to see you, you know, carry on  your own.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, maybe you're a hat distributor, and Brian owns a hat store.  I love it.  And you guys, you guys work on trying to get the hats for certain prices.  That's terrible.  That's a great idea.  What a waste of resources.  I've always wanted to do a hat distributor.  A dramatic slash comedic slash endearing piece about hats. 
[03:12:30]  Terrible.  It goes on behind the scenes.  Get Ben Gilligan on the phone.  The one, one, one thing that has been going around the internet, which was kind of funny,  is the fact that, uh, they say Walter goes into witness protection program and it becomes  Malcolm in the Middle.  Everybody thinks that.  Yeah.  Everybody.  And he's to say that that doesn't happen.  Oh.  To say that that isn't what, well, I, I, I, like I said, I saw that first episode and  if that's any indication on the rest of this, I mean, it's, I just sat there when the credits 
[03:13:00]  came on, I, I, I, I yelled out, no, I know, no, I know, more, exactly.  It's going to be, it's going to be sort of agony every week for the audience to wait to,  to the next, for the, for the next week.  And now I get the good thing that I saw the episode, but now I got to wait two episodes  to see.  You got to wait two weeks.  But I'll watch that first one again.  Yeah.  That was a, and I, I popped the disc in and I'm like, all right, I'm ready to watch this  and it comes on and I'm seeing the scene.  I'm like, all right, I got to watch the last one again.  So I had to pull it out because from the last screw with you. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  So it was the last season's last episode and they're going, because they always start  off, uh, these shows with something that you don't think makes any sense.  You're looking at a flower.  You're looking at that.  And this one, you're just seeing skateboards, right?  Skateboards.  And you're like, all right, why am I seeing this?  Did I miss something?  Yeah.  And it all makes sense.  And, uh, it's, it's fantastic.  It's great.  And it launches, I mean, it's like a, it's like they, they don't ease you into this since  you've seen that first one. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, they shoot you off.  Like a, it's like a right away.  You're like, what is going on?  And that scene where she drops the growth.  I'm like, ah, that's great.  You're loving that you have inside info.  Oh, it's the best.  You're loving it.  Look at, I love it.  Are you feeling resentful right now?  Yes, but for many other reasons.  Where do we begin, Anna?  You got two hours?  That's great.  Uh, when, when, when does this premiere now?  Uh, it, it premieres August 11th.  August 11th. 
[03:14:30]  Yes.  Sunday, nine AMC.  That's right.  Of course, Skylar, Anna Gunn.  Thanks so much for coming in.  Thank you.  You're a doll and a love.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks so much.
