<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Opie and Patrice O'Neal (filling in for Anthony) engaging in their characteristically vulgar and offensive banter, targeting their staff, Ben and Steve.  They then transition to "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," encouraging listeners with "WOW" stickers on their cars to report instances of women flashing their breasts, providing their contact information for sticker requests.

The show quickly shifts to a heated discussion about a recent surge in home invasions in Nassau County, Long Island. Patrice shares his own experience moving to what he thought was a safe area only to encounter increased crime.  The conversation devolves into inflammatory commentary about various gangs (Latin Kings, M18, MS-13), the perceived inadequacy of law enforcement, and the hosts' consideration of purchasing shotguns for self-defense.  Racial slurs and offensive stereotypes are prevalent throughout this segment, interspersed with calls from listeners offering opinions, catchphrases, and personal anecdotes related to home security.  The discussion meanders to related topics such as the effectiveness of guard dogs, shotgun types, and a humorous anecdote about a previous charity event gone wrong, resulting in the creation of the term "shwoogie."  The segment concludes with further discussion on home invasions, gun ownership, and more vulgar commentary.

The next segment features a series of calls focusing on guns, with callers describing their firearm collections and experiences with shooting, including detailed accounts of the sounds of various firearms discharging.  In-studio guests Patrice O'Neal and Rich Voss contribute to the conversation. Voss recounts a humorous anecdote about his honeymoon disrupted by his wife's menstruation.  The conversation then jumps to Saddam Hussein's trial (playing audio of his refusal to cooperate), home invasions, the JetBlue emergency landing (with cockpit audio played), and a German audio clip described as "chicken fucker" audio, with a translation provided.  Further listener calls, punctuated by catchphrases and anecdotes, are interspersed throughout.  A significant portion of this segment involves a heated argument between Opie, Anthony, and Voss about Voss's marriage and professional life, specifically a disagreement regarding Voss's wedding reception, resulting in personal attacks and insults.

The following segment is dominated by the ongoing argument between Opie and Rich Voss concerning Voss's wedding reception.  Voss expresses his anger over the low attendance, highlighting the lavish nature of the reception ("red rug," "velvet ropes," "free photographer," 800 cupcakes, buffet) and presenting RSVP cards as evidence of confirmed absences.  The argument escalates, focusing on accusations of insufficient communication regarding the Canadian wedding location and subsequent receptions, with Voss accusing his friends of lacking class for not attending and not bringing gifts. Opie counters with explanations of prior engagements and misunderstandings regarding the event's formality.  The argument involves frequent interruptions, insults ("jackass," "motherfucker," "bitch," "phony"), and side conversations.  Ben Sparks, Master Poe, and Bob Kelly join the discussion, contributing to the escalating tension.  The segment ends unresolved, highlighting the strained relationship between Voss and his friends.  Voss also displays a congratulatory card from President George W. Bush.

The penultimate segment begins with a discussion of Voss's car accident and his insurance dispute with Geico.  Voss humorously recounts the accident, blaming a "little 20-year-old Jewish girl," and jokingly considers ways to increase his insurance payout.  An unsuccessful attempt to contact Geico on air ensues.  The conversation then shifts to a heated exchange between Voss and Opie, again filled with profanity and personal attacks. The topic then changes to the hosts’ relationship with Howard Stern and other radio personalities, including a discussion about Patrice O'Neal's experiences on Stern's show and the differing atmospheres of the two programs.  This leads to a discussion about other comedians and their experiences with Stern and other radio shows. A caller, Jay, is berated for suggesting O&A's content is solely focused on Stern.  A musical interlude from "Silence of the Lambs: The Musical" is played, followed by banter about Hurricane Wilma and Voss's outdated video game habits.  The segment ends with a discussion of a contentious Aries Spears interview on another radio show, with audio clips played and the hosts defending Spears' actions. Ari Spears is a guest in studio for a portion of this segment.


The final segment focuses on a contentious interaction between the hosts and Aries Spears during a Miami appearance. The hosts recount Spears’ perceived unwillingness to adapt to their show's flow and his resistance to their suggestions, leading to a heated exchange culminating in Spears demanding to be taken back to his hotel. The conversation involves frequent use of racial slurs and offensive language.  The hosts compare Spears to other more cooperative comedians like Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hammond. The segment also recounts incidents involving the Subway gunman, Bernie Getz, having a meltdown on their show, and a broken wedding invitation accidentally damaged by Opie during a prank.  Throughout the segment, the hosts use comedic timing and exaggerated storytelling to recount the events. The main focus remains on the conflict with Aries Spears.

You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.

Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Satan!  You won't come, Satan!  Sweet!  Ah!  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:05:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Mama!  Who, who, Robin?  Who, who, Robin?  Who, who, who, Robin?  Robin?  Who, who, who, Robin?  White Robin?  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred!  I invented everything!  Put a bandana on your car!  Serious sucks ass!  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area. 
[00:05:30]  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  Liar, whore! Liar, whore!  And you know it!  Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Show me with your mouth.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  It's the last time I didn't ask you. 
[00:06:00]  Some great, beautiful girls, right?  Who were you tonight?  Did you catch one?  Hey, what's up, man? It's the Opie and Anthony program.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, isn't it?  Ah, that's what they say.  Oh, that's us.  That's what we say.  That's what we do every Wednesday.  That's our thing.  Look what we do now.  Yesterday was Shoes Day.  Tomorrow is Purse Day.  Ugh.  We do Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Shoes Day and Purse Day.  Ours is a little better, right?  And it's certainly not Tube Day. 
[00:06:30]  Yesterday was Tube's Day.  It's not Tube's Day.  I listened to that replay yesterday, and it just sounded like retards.  Doing radio.  Well, most of the guys that do radio are retards.  Yes.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, very simple concept.  You get a WOW sticker, you get a WOW sign, you write WOW in the back of your car,  you drive around and just mind your own business.  There are women out there that will flash you their boobs just because they see the WOW in your car.  Yeah, it happens.  That is a fact.  We got the official WOW bumper stickers.  All you have to do is send in a self-addressed stamped envelope to us here in New York City. 
[00:07:00]  The address, Anthony, 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019.  You now know the zip and everything.  That's right, and that address is up on opianthony.com.  I still have to sew it in my sleeve, the address, just in case I get lost.  We also have a WOW line, and that's starting to get some action.  That number is 1-866-WOW-ME-05, or 0-5, I should say.  WOW-ME-05, 1-866-WOW-ME-05. 
[00:07:30]  Got to say hi to Patrice O'Neill, sitting in for Jimmy Norton today.  Good morning.  Good morning, Patrice.  Good morning, O.  Good morning.  Good to have you.  And now we got to do the whole show we did in the office for everybody else.  So much stuff came out in the office today.  Just casual discussion.  We just should have microphones in the office, and if it works, then that's how we should just start the show.  Maybe we should just have mics on us all the time, and we never have to leave the house. 
[00:08:00]  We could just send in a dat tape of everything we talk about, and they could play it, and I could sit at home.  Because it never comes off like it wasn't off.  Of course not.  They'd be like, hey, let's talk about it.  All righty.  Hey, have you noticed?  Trying to act now like we all haven't heard it, and it's just all awkward.  Save it for the radio, man.  And you'd be like, hey, listen, I could talk.  I don't need to save my personality for the radio.  Then you'd be like, hey.  Hey.  And you can't make the point like you did.  Like, you could be brilliant 50 feet away in the office. 
[00:08:30]  You could be brilliant.  You walk in here and get a mic on in front of you, and all of a sudden the same thing is, and the guy did the thing.  The guy did the thing.  Well, but I wrote everything we talked about in the office.  Oh, you did.  Madonna premiere.  Michael Moore book making you smarter.  AIDS versus bird flu.  Saddam Hussein trial.  Hurricane Wilma.  Home invasions.  And some dude touching Patrice's chicken, and now he's a little wary. 
[00:09:00]  See?  I got it all ready to go.  See, you didn't even get that part of the story.  Touch Patrice's chicken.  It wasn't the fact that he touched the chicken that got Patrice all skeeved out.  It was the fact that he touched Patrice's chicken, the raw chicken, put it in a bag.  Right.  And then grabbed his other stuff with the same hand that now has chicken juice on it, which can give you salmonella.  Oh, okay.  And then puts that.  What was your other item that he touched?  It was like macaroni salad in the cup. 
[00:09:30]  In the cup.  So now you're going to grab the cup, and it's going to be on your hands.  That's what I'm saying.  Damn.  And now you got the salmonella.  These guys do this thing every day, and people aren't dropping from the salmonella.  Plus the fact that you go to Brazil and eat hooker ass.  I don't eat hooker ass, dude.  You used to eat hooker ass, but you're worried about a butcher touching stuff after he touched your chicken.  See, this is something that Norton spreads.  It's like he wants everybody to be as piece of a crap as he is.  Yeah.  I go there with toys.  You saw my toys. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I go there because I know how evil I am.  So I go there with safe stuff, with glass toys.  Yeah.  And I don't engage in third world booty hole, man.  I don't have a death wish.  I take high blood pressure medicine.  I don't want to die.  All right.  So now you've got a legitimate concern.  I thought you were, you know, licking hooker ass.  No, man.  A guy that licks hooker ass shouldn't worry about what the butcher's touching. 
[00:10:30]  It's a salmonella, man.  Chicken.  That's salmonella.  It does.  Raw chicken.  Something.  Does something scare you?  Yeah.  Like, that should, like, you know, guns might not scare you, but like, you know, E. coli.  Raw chicken.  Things like that.  Undercooked pork.  See, I don't mind undercooked pork.  Really?  That's trichinosis that gives you, though.  Trichinosis.  Schnickinosis.  I'll tell you the bad one.  Linguini and red clam sauce. 
[00:11:00]  What will that do?  Well, if you were at my apartment Saturday morning, I would show you.  Oh, no.  Oh, you had food poisoning?  Oh, my God.  I was just showering from my ass.  That was just my...  Oh, you didn't throw up, though?  No, it was just...  So that's not food poisoning.  It was just a salad shooter coming from my butt.  I love one of those.  I don't mind that, because sometimes I get stopped up, so it's like, oh, I don't mind  that.  It cleans it out?  Yeah, sometimes I like a little food poisoning.  No.  Yeah, you know what? 
[00:11:30]  I don't know my movements.  You know what?  You're very accurate.  You feel so much lighter after the fact.  Oh, you just get it all out.  It's a quick six hours of hell, and then you're like, whoa, I feel a little lighter.  Colonic.  Natural colonic.  Thank you, no.  Just keep it regular.  All right, so, all right, the butcher thing, now I'm with you, I guess.  Yeah, I just, you know, I didn't, I wasn't dangerous.  I don't even think Norton was dangerous out there, man.  He didn't, no one did anything dangerous.  He said he had sex with one of these girls without a rubber. 
[00:12:00]  That, to me, seems a little dangerous.  That is dangerous.  It sounds, you know, great on the outside, because who wants to use a rubber when you  have sex?  Nobody.  Yeah, that's, that's my, my, my, my, my, my thing doesn't work with, with, with, with  one now.  No.  It's just, when I put it on, it's just, it's like strangling it.  It's just dead.  It's just choking the life out of it.  Like, you know what I do?  When it's hard, and I go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's hard now, so I try to just roll the  condom on, like, and just start, and then it just, wah, wah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[00:12:30]  I got that.  It's just.  I got that noise for you.  Wah, wah.  Wah, wah.  That's it.  That is the sound of your dick just getting soft.  That's why I don't, I don't, I don't cheat on my girl.  Not because I'm not a, a bad person, it's just.  You can't put the condom on.  I can't, and then, you know.  You don't want to not use one.  She caught me when I was, with all this medicine.  I'm making my balls, uh, useless.  Oh, God. 
[00:13:00]  So it's like, that's why I gotta, I gotta be connected now.  Those things are awful.  There you go.  Um, and then the home invasion thing, too.  Yeah, this has just got me now in a tizzy.  We gotta explain this for the rest of the country.  Uh-huh.  Patrice, go.  Uh-huh.  White people escape from reality.  There you go.  We gotta explain this for the rest of the country.  He's making fun of me.  But I think the rest of the country could kind of understand this.  Yeah.  A lot of people move away from the cities to the suburbs because they feel like they're safer.  Yeah, you move to a place that you think is a safe place. 
[00:13:30]  I moved to the North Shore of Nassau County.  Now, this is an area that is pretty wealthy, Jewish, a lot of Jews in the area, a lot of  rich Indians that are doctors.  Mm-hmm.  You know, they live up there.  The book, The Great Gatsby.  The Great Gatsby.  Yeah, it was set up there.  A lot of these things.  Teddy Roosevelt's house, you know, North Shore, Long Island.  Very nice area to live in.  So I figure, hey, I'm gonna finally move on up like George Jefferson. 
[00:14:00]  I'm moving on up.  I'm gonna live there and not have to worry so much.  I lived in Brooklyn for a while and not, you know, I live in Flatbush or nothing.  I lived in Bay Ridge.  Nothing ever happened to you, did it?  No, it did.  It was just, because it's fucking Brooklyn.  My car was getting keyed.  Uh, come out one day and my girlfriend's Jeep had, you know, the window smashed out  and the spare tire's gone and property damage.  Uh, yeah, but, and very minor theft. 
[00:14:30]  But look what's happening in Long Island.  This is the thing.  And it's all, because there's only one or two cops because there's no need to have a police force.  Exactly.  And now the guy, the executive of Nassau County is in all kinds of deep shit because he wants  to cut the cops even more during this time when now we need a shitload of cops.  I want cops everywhere.  I want Nassau County cops.  And when you drive through Nassau County, you really don't see that many Nassau County  cops.  You see, uh, some Nassau County Highway Patrol cops, like the guys out on the expressway  and parkways and shit, waiting there to pull you over to give you a ticket for speeding. 
[00:15:00]  But I want them cruising through those neighborhoods.  I want them peeking around, looking.  Because there's no crime there.  They don't have the one, the patrol.  But there is crime now.  Now it is.  That's the smart thing to do.  And that's not a moneymaker to be cruising, uh, you know, up and down the street.  No, no, that's not making the revenue.  You know, it's out on the highway.  Yeah, you got to hide in a bush.  That's how you make the money.  Well, apparently now it's, uh, easy pickings.  That's what Nassau County is now.  They found it.  It's easy pickings. 
[00:15:30]  Well, this has been going on for about a week to ten days, right?  Yeah.  And I...  No, this is the past year they've had unprecedented numbers of home invasion, robberies, and Nassau County.  And home invasion, let me tell you, that's, that's, uh, again, with my law and understanding.  Yeah.  Home invasion is high.  It's, it's almost, it's right under murder.  It really is a violent, nasty thing.  It's home invasion.  Coming into somebody's house when they're home turns it into something where they might as well kill you.  Yeah, yeah.  Why leave you alive if they're going to invade your home while you're going to leave you home? 
[00:16:00]  It's just a horrifying thing to think to have happen.  Now, a lot of these people, uh, a majority of the break-ins, if not all of them, are through some type of open door.  These stupid motherfuckers in Nassau County have been living like the, they think...  They still think it's 1950.  Yeah, with their door unlocked, that that's their safety.  Look, I can do this.  I don't have to lock my door.  So, I, it, it makes me feel like I live in a safe place.  Lock your doors, assholes. 
[00:16:30]  Batten down the hatches, I say.  But why would you do that?  Like, you know, you move, what's the point of moving from, uh, Brooklyn to go live the same way in Nassau?  You know what I'm saying?  Like, you, you went to leave to be safe and feel what it feels like to sleep with your doors open, hear crickets.  Yeah.  You know.  Because people like that.  It's either doors or windows.  What people like doing in the suburbs is sleeping without the air conditioner on.  You open up that window and you hear, yeah, the birds or the crickets. 
[00:17:00]  You feel like, ooh, that was a nice breeze.  You're smelling outside.  That's what you want.  That's why you moved there.  And now, uh, a member of the Latin Kings or the, what, M18 or whatever they're called?  No, what?  Or the, my, my most horrifying one yet.  They, they are identifying the gangs.  There's three gangs.  There's three gangs that are doing the home invasion.  Is it M18, I think?  Oh, there's gangs that are doing the home invasion.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Three of them.  There's gangs.  The Latin Kings, which are huge out in, like, Brentwood in Suffolk County, Long Island, out in that area.  Uh, they're, they're blowing up out there. 
[00:17:30]  They're huge.  Are they tying up the people?  Uh, yeah.  They tie them up with the phone cords.  They rip the phone cords out.  They tie them up.  Who has phone cords?  I know.  You're cordless.  You better have a phone cord for those motherfuckers.  I'd be like, oh, I don't have phone cords.  They're going to kill me.  They can't tie me up.  They rip it out.  Are you going to install an old-fashioned phone cord?  I'm going to have an old-fashioned, with a, with a phone cord.  One of those old, big, heavy, black bell telephones.  And they tie you up, uh, blindfold you.  They, they, they're kids in a lot of these cases.  And they take the kids, and they make them, uh, lay down on the floor and put pillows over their heads. 
[00:18:00]  Oh.  And tell them to stay there.  Oh, God.  Oh, my.  And then they, uh, ransack the place.  They get the jewelry, computer equipment, and, uh, load it into a waiting car.  And then they drive off.  And leave the people there horrified.  Well, at least they're not killing them.  Yet.  Yet.  Oops.  So, the last, uh, case, they go in.  Uh, this woman, uh, comes out of her bedroom.  And, uh, they kind of rough her up a little, send her back.  Then the husband comes out.  He's wearing an NYPD shirt. 
[00:18:30]  But he's not a cop.  So, they go bullshit on this guy.  Where's the motherfucking gun?  Where's the fucking gun, motherfucker?  Oh, so they thought he was a cop.  Yeah, they thought he was a cop.  Because he's got the NYPD shirt on.  And he's just like, I'm a tourist or whatever.  He's just, I, they're for sale everywhere, pally.  Why do they ever agree to sell NYPD?  I know.  Shirts and hats and stuff.  Unless you're a cop, don't wear that shit.  I've been in situations where I'm a little scared, but then you see a guy in, like, one of those shirts or a hat.  And you're like, oh, all right.  Great.  And then you realize that.  Works at the deli. 
[00:19:00]  You realize half these guys are just out of town or they just bought the damn thing.  They bought it.  Before they go back to Iowa.  It was right under the fucking NYPD shirt in his drawer.  And he pulled that one out.  I feel a little fear, but then I see, like, a guy with an FBI shirt on.  I'm like, oh, all right.  Yeah.  He'll know what to do.  He's got it under control.  He's just some plumber from fucking Indiana.  You look, you look, Anthony, he kind of looks like he's, like, he lives in a rich, in a decent neighborhood, evidently.  Yeah.  You look like a, like a mob union representative.  You look like somebody, like, don't, let's not get into any problems. 
[00:19:30]  Like it should be some trouble or something.  Yeah, you just look like trouble, man.  You do.  The Sicilian in me.  You do look like trouble.  But you like the city, though, right?  Oh.  Yeah, I really do.  I hope he likes the city.  Eventually, I'll move back out to the suburbs, get a house and stuff.  But why are people moving back in to the city?  Yeah, I really do enjoy the city now, finally.  You know, I don't like the homeless guy, you know, showering outside my window every night.  But besides that, yeah, it's good.  Oh, that was it.  The third gang.  The fat guys.  The fat guys.  The fat guys out of Manhattan are breaking in now. 
[00:20:00]  And I blame TV.  Once again, I blame the news.  You made a great point in the office.  Because just before he went on the air, there's a new home invasion.  Not the one you're going to read about in the paper today.  A new one that they just discovered.  They had a live shot from Long Island, Newcastle, and they showed a bicycle in a driveway from  like a helicopter shot and said, an attempted home invasion here.  And the guy just, I guess, they thwarted it, the homeowners, and he left his bike and ran. 
[00:20:30]  Took off on foot.  But, you know, another attempt.  And I think it's these copycats is what's happening.  They make it look easy.  Yeah, the news is showing you, wow, look how easy this is.  It's easy picking.  And so now these gangs go, all right, let's get a couple of guys together.  We'll go out.  We'll break in.  And, you know, take money.  There's money to be, money for the taking at these places.  That's the fat guys, right?  The fat guys out of Manhattan.  Nice.  A little scared of them.  The Latin Kings, M18.  And now, you know, I was reading the paper. 
[00:21:00]  Locks at Home Depot.  They showed this woman buying a big lock.  Look at this woman.  Look at her.  Look at her.  That's going to protect you from the fat guys.  Here's what you've got to do.  What a bunch of dummies.  People are lining up at the Home Depots to get the real expensive locks.  The locks.  Yeah, that's going to stop people.  Here's what you've got to do, people of Nassau County.  Guns!  Guns.  Today, when I leave this station, I am going right to the gun store and getting myself a shotgun. 
[00:21:30]  All of a sudden, the rapier.  You're going to sleep with it?  I'm not feeling.  It's going to be right there next to my bed.  Really?  Right there.  And you've had, like, some training in picking up guns and just...  Oh, I'm really good with guns.  Oh, my God.  I mean, and not in terms of shooting, but in terms of, like, you know, hear a noise and...  No, I'm not, like, crazy.  Quick draw.  No, I'm not quick draw.  Like, when the Puerto Rican comes in with the pistol to your head, it's like, that gun is now his property. 
[00:22:00]  He robbed a cop, which he thought he was a cop.  So, don't do it.  Don't get a gun and get killed.  I sleep.  He's just upgrading because right now he's protecting himself with a rapier.  I have a rapier, which is a sword.  That is my...  Look at his face.  Look at his face.  That is my home defense right now.  I can't believe what a white guy you are.  I have a sword.  He has a rapier.  Oh, God.  With a protection for his knuckles.  The M18 and the MS-13. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Relatively new to New York.  There has formed refugees from Salvadorian Civil War.  They began arriving 20 years ago.  Other games like Vatos Locos, Trevisos, and Vagos are even newer.  Born as recently arrived.  Mexicans responded to harassment from older gangs such as the Bloods, Latin Kings, and Nietes.  With time, the immigrant street corner crews have grown larger, more numerous, and more violent. 
[00:23:00]  Where are they at?  They're out on Long Island.  They're everywhere.  Dude, they're out on Long Island, these guys.  The Latin Kings are huge out on Long Island.  But they can't just hang.  Look at this.  Here it is.  Home invasion.  Oh, look at...  What am I going to...  They must...  They have to stake you out or something.  Like, they can't...  Because just a mild-mannered, like, Mexican walking around without, like, escorting, being  escorted somewhere, is a suspect.  It's like, there's a Mexican in my area.  So they're going to call the cops anyway without that. 
[00:23:30]  Here's their M.O.  They drive around.  They drive around these nice neighborhoods that are relatively close to the expressway or  the parkway.  And they cruise around slow at 3 in the morning.  And when they see a likely yard, something maybe that isn't seen from the street, not  well lit, something like that, they'll check the doors.  They'll check the garage.  They'll try to get in through an opening like that.  If they can't, they'll move on.  Try to find another one.  If they can, you're fucked.  They're coming in your fucking house. 
[00:24:00]  I sleep with my...  See, now, you two said he's getting the shotgun and everything.  When I sleep, the bedroom door has a lock on it.  That motherfucker's locked.  You got a panic room?  I have the panic room bedroom.  So if someone breaks into the house, they're going to then have to break into my bedroom.  I'll hear something outside.  That's when I pick up and level the shotgun.  Through your wooden doors?  Through my wooden doors.  Through your wooden panic room door.  Fucking Jodie Foster over there.  There is yet to be a home invasion where they have hacked through my doors. 
[00:24:30]  Four locks and an iron door.  Is that what you got?  Absolutely.  That's why I always live in apartments, man.  I don't like creepy houses.  I don't like...  When I drive through Connecticut, it scares me more than the worst part of Brooklyn.  There's nothing worse than that creaky echo sound of the stairwell fucking iron door  that just waiting to be robbed or raped in an apartment building.  Oh, man.  Oh, the elevator don't work.  But look...  Wait a minute, though. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, motherfucker.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  But now you're more scared than when you lived in Brooklyn.  You're right.  Because of the illusion of safety.  Yeah.  At least like an iron door...  Put it this way.  You're safe in your house when you have an iron door and all the creaking stairs and the whatever else. 
[00:25:30]  You're true.  I mean, you know what I mean?  I believe it.  And there's always somebody around in New York.  Always somebody around somewhere.  A lot of people are calling in saying, buy a gun and fire away.  Shotgun.  This is just...  I am purchasing the Mossberg.  This is what white people do.  I'm getting...  Exactly.  This is just a setup to be able to murder young...  No.  Young, scared...  And depriving.  They were afraid of other gangs.  Right.  And had to leave.  And this is just protection for them.  And they need a little revenue.  You know what, though? 
[00:26:00]  This is what will happen.  If some guy breaks in or a gang breaks in, one guy gets killed in someone's living room,  you know, a homeowner with a shotgun, boom, he's dead, that'll cut back on this.  Because then it'll be like, all right, it was easy pickings.  They're starting to fight back.  That's right.  Let's move somewhere up.  We're going to have to take one out, Patrice.  I'm sorry.  One's got to go.  We're going to have to take one out.  One has got to go.  This is more non-understanding of violence by the white man.  We're going to have to take one out.  It's got to escalate.  As violent as you people are, you just don't understand that all this is going to be violent. 
[00:26:30]  That's what I'm saying.  These kids are not afraid of some white dude who goes buy a pistol.  The M18 doesn't like freedom.  We've got to fight him.  It's MS-13.  MS-13.  No, and M18.  Oh, okay.  There's two.  A bunch of people are screaming on the phones.  It's MS-13.  I'm looking here.  Gangs like M18 and MS-13.  It is the MS-13.  They call him.  We're the MS-13, fool.  Fool-ass, mark-ass, nigga.  I'm sure there's some curled-up fingers right now trying to represent that. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, home.  Hey, home.  Hey, Vato.  Wearing those flannels with only the top button buttoned.  The collar.  Who's this Anthony Vato?  2-1.  2-1.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Connecticut.  Jeff?  Guys, good morning.  How are you?  Good morning.  We're having a good time with Patrice O'Neal.  Excellent.  Hey, listen.  You know, the one thing that nobody ever realizes is that when you dial 911, the police are never 
[00:27:30]  obligated to protect you as an individual.  They're obligated to protect society as a whole.  So buy a gun, stock up, and when you drop one, you're exactly right.  The crime is going to drop.  If you look at places like Vermont, and what's the crime where they can carry guns anywhere?  Zero.  Nothing.  So go for it.  There you go.  I don't agree with that.  There you go.  People say if you shoot one of these guys, then the whole gang comes back for you.  I just don't.  Time and time again, it's proven that crime drops with an increase in gun ownership.  That's true.  People are afraid. 
[00:28:00]  Documented.  That's true.  It's just more conspiracy to kill the black and poor people.  Is that it?  It just is.  Well, why aren't they self-respecting white guys, Robin?  It's so quick just to shoot somebody, man.  I live around murderers and stuff.  You just mind your business.  We can't have them coming in our homes, Patrice.  Just one home.  This is what's killing me.  How many homes got invaded?  I think 25.  25, really?  Yeah.  That's a lot.  That is a lot.  I was going to say four or five. 
[00:28:30]  No.  It's 25, man.  And they're just operating.  Never mind.  Shoot these Mexicans.  They're all in my area.  Yeah.  Just stay.  I don't like that.  Stay out of our neighborhoods.  Stay out of my goddamn neighborhood.  And then they have that.  We're staying out of your neighborhood.  We don't do all of them.  No, you're not.  You go there to buy some drugs.  Hell no.  Or pretend you're an undercover cop.  It's nothing.  You're safe in our neighborhood.  That's where you should move, where black people are.  Nothing will happen to you.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Black people just don't buy all the white people.  You know what, though?  I wouldn't be able to drive anywhere. 
[00:29:00]  The second I hop in my car and drive, I'd be pulled over.  What are you doing here?  What are you doing in this neighborhood?  I love watching cops.  I love when the white guys are driving in a little Toyota or something, and the cops pull  them over.  Where were you coming from?  Oh, a friend.  I have a friend.  You've got no friend over here.  What were you doing?  What were you doing?  No, I was dropping off something.  They never have the story, because they were buying drugs, and they always get it out of  them, too.  The cops, you were buying drugs, like, well, yeah, I was, you're going to get yourself 
[00:29:30]  killed.  Stay out of this neighborhood.  Always some dopey white guy trying to buy dope from the black guys.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's a-  I'm going to get killed.  That's an ongoing story.  I'm trading in my rapier.  I'm upgrading.  It's almost like one of my favorite games, Age of Empires, Opie, where now I've reached  a level where I have to now upgrade my forces, and I'm upgrading to the firearm age.  Nice.  I'm trading in the swords and the cavalrymen for some musketeers. 
[00:30:00]  I'm going to feel bad for you when you have to deal with the guilt of actually killing  a human being, man.  You know something?  There would be no guilt whatsoever.  You don't think so?  Not, if some motherfucker broke into my house, if I killed someone accidentally, driving,  something like that, I would be, it would be the most guilt, I, the rest of my life would  be spent, uh, guilt ridden.  Some motherfucker breaks into my house, I would hope to get him in the kneecaps so I could  just fuck with him a little bit.  So I could just, I would, I would hire people to play out the Pulp Fiction scene with the 
[00:30:30]  fucking rapist guy in the basement on the guy just out of pleasure that this motherfucker  was trying, probably laughing with his buddies with the last one that he got away with.  Like, all that shit plays out in my head.  Hey, yeah, Anthony.  That he's laughing.  You had dreams of being, like, a vigilante.  Oh, I would love it.  Oh, yeah.  He's just waiting for the day to get killed somebody.  Dead, dead.  That's right.  Dead, dead.  And saying a catchphrase like, you broke into the wrong L.I. crib. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, we need to, we need to come up with, we need to come up with Anthony's catchphrase  today.  Anthony's catchphrase.  What's my catchphrase when I shoot this motherfucker?  That's your job today as, as a, uh, listener of this program.  You just went there.  Anthony's catchphrase.  I shot him, and he went, oh, eh?  Oh, yeah, baby.  I got some, uh, stats here.  In Suffolk County, there have been 17 home invasions this year.  Nassau has had at least 29 cases since December. 
[00:31:30]  29.  Since December.  Great.  We're working on, uh, 30.  That's a lot.  That is, that is, why is that not news?  It is news.  It is news.  It's news.  They're just starting now, and it's because no one's done anything.  The police presence isn't, uh, hasn't been stepped up.  Uh, the people are like, it's like sheep.  They're like sheep.  This one woman, they, remember they just found that dead body of that, uh, girl?  Oh, yeah.  That woman.  In Sands Point?  In Sands Point, which is like hoity-toity exclusive area. 
[00:32:00]  That is the Great Gatsby.  That is the Great Gatsby house is right up there.  They find her dead, and they're talking to the homeowners, and she goes, I can't believe  this happened here.  This is such a nice neighborhood.  We all, uh, during the day, our doors are unlocked.  Yeah.  Fucking advertise, asshole.  Get on the news and tell people your doors are unlocked every day.  They're unlocked in Canada, evidently, you know?  Yeah, evidently, I saw that with, uh, Michael Moore walked around and was able to open people's  houses.  We're going to get into the Michael Moore thing after the break, because that's a whole 
[00:32:30]  another half hour, man.  Even Patrice, we're on the same page with that.  Uh, Biscuit Eater.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, you need to not worry about those Mossbergs.  You need a Remington 1100.  Really?  Remington 1100?  Why?  That's an automatic.  You don't want to be sitting there trying to pump off shots.  You need an automatic, you know?  I can't be jamming, though.  I can't have any fucking automatic shotgun jams.  No.  I take out a kneecap.  I don't want a fucking shell lodged in there.  Nah, it's a Cadillac, man. 
[00:33:00]  Go with the Remington 1100.  It's a Cadillac of shotguns?  You know what?  I'll tell you, one of your calls are going to call and tell you the perfect gun for killing  a Mexican.  You know what?  The, uh, the Beaner 4000, that'll knock his head.  You know, I need the punisher.  He picked the perfect day to be here.  Oh, yeah.  Because if it was Bill Burby, just a bunch of white guys talking like this is normal shit.  But you're going to show us the other side of it.  Patrice has the other side of it.  Why are you getting a shotgun?  Just let him come in and take some shit.  Let me tell you something.  Tie you up with a phone cord.  Because they're kind of short, right? 
[00:33:30]  Sometimes you miss.  If you get big, big holes in your gun, it'll miss those little sons of bitches.  See, you got to get them long holes.  Mexicans is short.  What you need.  See, they got an extra, they got an extra of, uh, uh, juggler vein in their shoulder  nobody know about.  We cut one open the other day, like a frog.  Found they got six juggler veins.  One in the knee.  Let's say hi to Kevin.  Hey, Kevin. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, I tell you what.  Don't go to an automatic.  Stick with a pump.  Because when you rack that shell up in there, it's going to make them shit.  Exactly.  I enjoy the pump shotgun.  They're more dependable than an automatic.  More dramatic.  And, uh, more dramatic.  I love that sound.  Movie drama.  I love the sound.  Sometimes you rack that motherfucker up, the people go running.  Why don't you get a 30-30?  I was thinking maybe a 50 cal.  Yeah.  Oh, a lever action.  Lever?  Why don't you get a, uh, uh...  Why don't you get me a Winchester?  A Buffalo Bill one.  A six-shooter that I could fan with my hand. 
[00:34:30]  Hey, should we do, uh...  Pew, pew, pew, man.  You guys want to do shootouts today?  Take that, partner.  Let's do shootouts today.  Oh, people with their guns?  Yeah.  You guys, uh, if you want to shoot off guns today on the show, give us a call.  This is mostly for our Midwest listeners, not our city listeners.  Patrice is in shock.  Yeah.  I'm dead serious, man.  That's not fair.  The last time we did this, you should have heard the artillery.  Oh, my God.  Artillery.  That's some heavy artillery.  All in Wisconsin.  Yeah, yeah.  That they're getting ready for some war. 
[00:35:00]  The militia.  Why don't you call them?  Call them.  Pay for them.  Is there a Long Island militia?  Is there a Nassau County militia?  They're holding a luncheon this Friday, the Nassau militia.  Pay for some of these guys from Wisconsin who's practicing for the end of the world and fly them over and let them snatch out.  Let them bivouac in my backyard with some tents.  Look at how excited we are today.  I am so excited about getting a gun and the potential of one of these guys breaking in and me offing them.  Someone is asking, why not a dog, Anthony?  Why not a dog?  Oh, dogs.  First of all, the last home invasion, the people were initially alerted by the dog, but the dog did nothing. 
[00:35:30]  The dog barked.  The woman got up and was accosted.  But, see, these people are planning this great because the area you live in, they kind of, they know, everybody has the little sissy dogs.  Right.  Yeah.  And no one's going to allow somebody to walk around with a rottweiler.  Nope.  It'll be, it'll be, it'll be like neighborhood, you know, pressure to say, hey, no pit bulls, no rottweiler. 
[00:36:00]  Any dog that have a use for that situation, they're not going to have it.  This, my neighborhood is the watering hole with the zebras around it and the elk and the thing.  They're just sitting there and the tigers and lions and everything are just looking going, this is some of the easiest shit we're ever going to get.  And something's got to be done.  You're right.  The dogs that I see being walked around the neighborhood are bichon frisées and little Yorkshire terriers.  It'll be more police that if your rottweiler attacks a poodle in your neighborhood, it'll be more police than this home invasion. 
[00:36:30]  And, like you said, there's some rich Indians and stuff.  Let's be honest.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  How many white people get home invaded?  These guys are genius, man.  Yeah, they're very smart.  They're robbing Indians.  They know exactly where to go.  Yeah, but they don't know.  What are they, sniff a curry first?  I bet you they're staking out, man.  All right, here we go.  You think they're doing a little stakeout first?  We got a guy that his house was broken into.  Ed, I'm, oh, Illinois, actually. 
[00:37:00]  I thought it was L.I.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Great show.  Yeah, I drive trucks, and I got an assortment of guns, and the shotgun, especially the pump, is the best.  I was out on the road.  My brother's home lives with me.  He's about 27 at the time.  Two, no offense to your guest there, two of what you guys would call shwoogies broke in there.  And my brother was arguing with him, and he had a ball bat in his hand.  And he was getting nowhere.  You're a shwoogie, Patrice, yes. 
[00:37:30]  My wife came out of the bedroom with shotgun.  I'm sorry to cut you off.  Is the new word for niggas shmoogies out there?  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  It's a Boston Jewish term.  We have been using the word shwoogie for many years, Patrice.  Behind our back?  And yes, you are.  Keep us.  Could you keep us updated?  You didn't get that.  The last one I heard was moon cricket, but could you please keep us updated with all the news?  You didn't get the mailer?  Yeah, I didn't get shwoogies, you know.  I need a new white, white, cracker's getting old.  Cracker's old, yeah.  Listen to this.  The old listeners, they get sick of us telling the stories over and over again. 
[00:38:00]  But we've got to tell Patrice where shwoogie came from.  It was Brucey Mittman.  Brucey Mittman, our responsible general manager when we were up in Boston.  Jewish guy.  Jewish guy.  Little short Jewish guy.  He had to be like 5'3".  Joe was suburban.  He almost needed a fucking stepladder to get into it.  This guy was so short.  And so, like, he knew he was short and he had to do something about it.  So he got the biggest vehicle that rolled off an assembly line.  Napoleon.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Napoleon Complex.  Definitely.  And we had raised some money. 
[00:38:30]  Well, we got in a lot of trouble.  Yeah.  For something.  At this point, I don't even know what we got in trouble.  I know.  I don't know what it was.  But we had done something where we had a charity thing attached to our CD that we put out.  It was a charity for, what was it?  I got it right there.  I got it right there.  Yeah.  It was the only people that would take our money.  We tried the Jimmy Fund first.  That's where we started.  The money for cancer kids, they wouldn't take our money.  They did not want opium and antimony.  They would rather a kid die of cancer than accept money from the sleaze bags that are opium and antimony. 
[00:39:00]  So we were trying to do a good thing because we didn't really make money off this thing.  So we tried breast cancer.  We tried this.  Diseases, cancer, more respected than opium and antimony.  A lot of, yeah, a lot of diseases said no to opium and antimony.  So finally.  We don't need your help.  Finally, who came on board?  Well, I'm trying to find the credit now.  Hold on a minute.  Where the heck is it?  On the back, maybe?  Okay.  Can I see that picture?  No.  Because I know what that's going to be.  There's some good pictures on there.  Hold on.  Where the heck is the charity? 
[00:39:30]  Shwuggies.  Shwuggies, yes.  Yeah.  Black people, we really need to come up with some new...  All I know is cracker and honky.  Pat from Wynaki saying my catchphrase should be, don't fuck with a fancy man.  Very fancy.  Or...  Okay.  You've been owned.  As I finish casting.  Feel the cold steel of my rapier.  No, sir.  I will be using a shotgun.  The charity that finally said yes to us was... 
[00:40:00]  Come on.  The New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans.  New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans.  Took your money.  They were the ones that finally decided to take our money.  Can't you just send money?  No, because it was a big presentation that they had to be involved with.  Oh, so they had to support it.  Right.  So, we obviously were working. 
[00:40:30]  So, our boss won a little good press.  He went down to deliver the big giant check.  You know the big giant check?  Yeah, the lottery check.  The big giant check.  Really huge.  It's like, what, six feet across or whatever?  And so, we had to deliver.  And it was a bunch of black guys that he was giving the check to.  I guess they were minority, homeless, veteran thing.  And he actually was using this to get us out of trouble because we got into some racial shit with another radio station.  I now remember.  So, we got real ugly with a few people and caused a stir up in Boston. 
[00:41:00]  We snapped some pictures of him handing over the check.  Right, so, but as he's leaving to hand in this huge check to the Shwoogies, he comes in as we're doing our afternoon broadcast, all pissed off going,  because of you guys, instead of playing golf, I got to deliver this check to the Shwoogies.  And that's where you heard?  That was the first time I've ever heard it.  But it existed before he said it.  I guess. 
[00:41:30]  I guess in the Jewish community.  Shwoogie.  That's like a...  But this guy likes Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  You know the Shwo...  Yeah, how did it spread out to the Midwest?  Ain't that something how...  It's like racism really is like the internet.  It is.  But where are the new white...  How come there aren't no white terms?  I need a new one.  You employed guy.  What are you going to call him?  Really?  You homeowner.  You responsible father.  We need a mix of...  What's Shwoogie mixed with Swatza and... 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And Oodley's...  I don't even know where it comes from.  Yeah, I have no clue where that would come from.  What the root word is.  Origin.  But our general manager, who was all pissed off at us because of our racial shit that we  got into...  Yeah.  Comes walking in after giving us a scolding saying he's not going to be able to play golf  that day because he got to deliver the check to the Shwoogies.  I cannot believe that.  And then there's a local paper smiling all big with all the black guys around him with  the big check.  I don't believe...  Why do people never cease to amaze me, man? 
[00:42:30]  I'm trying not to be racist and it's just like, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Shwoogie.  Mmm.  All right.  We should take our...  Good luck, bro.  There's a catchphrase they're saying I should have.  Good luck, bro.  In a thunderous voice.  Headshot.  They're really getting the video game because they know I'm into the first person shooter  video games.  They're really kind of getting that into it.  My catchphrase should be, sir, you are banned.  Because now I ban people from the instant feedback when they're nasty.  Nothing really hit me, though. 
[00:43:00]  I kind of like...  Yeah, we'll get a good catchphrase.  We'll get a good catchphrase for Anthony today.  You looked up the word Shwoogie?  It's in.  Uh, Shwoogie, a member of the African-American race.  It's a definition in where?  Urban Dictionary.  But then, uh, the second meaning, it says Shwoogie refers to the opening of the show.  Really?  Was what their old boss, Brucie, at radio station WAF in Boston would call black people.  Are we responsible for spreading this word? 
[00:43:30]  I guess we were the ones that...  It's your F in fault.  I guess we technically invented the term.  I think Bruce made it up.  Brucie made it up.  And then we just, through the power of radio, have spread it nationwide.  And then it's used in a sentence.  B-b-boys, did you see that Shwoogie stealing that car?  Someone said it's a Yiddish word for shadow.  Oh.  All right, whatever.  So, let's say hi.  One more call before we go to break.  Uh, Tim on Long Island.  Tim?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Uh, I'm laying in bed last night. 
[00:44:00]  I'm watching this fucking pathetic show, Dog the Bounty Hunter.  You ever see that shit?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, anyway, I'm fucking hearing noises all over my house.  I'm up all fucking night with one hand on my shotgun, the other one on my clicker.  I didn't get any fucking sleep last night waiting for one of these maniacs to break in my house.  Yeah, now every noise you hear outside, I got a fucking raccoon that fucks with the garbage behind the house.  Right.  And it just scares the piss out of me.  You hear something, like, rattle around and go, oh, here it comes.  It's going down. 
[00:44:30]  And there I go.  There I go to my sliding glass door around back with the rapier sword in my hand.  Like, it's hilarious how, like, I'm deathly afraid of white guys like that guy that just called it.  Like, it's just, those white guys seem to be the most dangerous people I've ever seen.  You know, these fucking guys where I'm fucking there.  And I thought that was Long Island.  I didn't think Long Island was full of, like, citizens who really, like, you know, should be nervous about those.  There's a bunch of Italians and, like, your fucking guy with the thingy-majiggy. 
[00:45:00]  You fucking get nervous, because if I see you in my neighborhood, I'm fucking nervous.  Jesus, listen to that.  I'm on the radio trying to entertain this guy.  How fucking are you?  You're coming to my fucking neighborhood, huh?  You better fucking book Billy Burr, your mother.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pull your eyeball and shit.  You better leave my neighborhood and go to Howard Beach.  They'll fucking treat you better, motherfucker.  All right, let's.  With that, let's take our first break. 
[00:45:30]  We got Rich Voss, who's going to join the program as well.  Rich.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  As we go to break, something from our Demental World CD.  What the hell?  Wow.  We'll do that today.  Check this out.  Hello?  Yes, I'm calling.  Is this ******?  Yes, it is.  What can we do for you today?  Yes, I just got a call.  Yes.  And he gave me my claim number.  Uh-huh.  Because I won a prize.  Yes, you did.  What claim number did you get?  654.  654.  321.  321.

Hello?  Hello?  That is coming up as a European vacation.  A European vacation?  Yeah.  He had told me something like $10,000.  I would have.  6J.  6J?  Yes. 
[00:46:30]  I thought she said A, John.  You thought she...  I thought it was an A.  It's 6J?  It's 6J as in, uh, jump.  Oh.  We got some good news and bad news.  You're still the winner.  Okay.  But, uh, your prize is a set of steak knives.  A set of steak knives?  Yes.  The European vacation for you and your family and the $10,000 spending money is for 6A.  Oh.  And you'll have to pay for the shipping on the, uh, steak knives.  Oh, all right.  And that's $19.95.  Okay.  Would you like to, uh...  Uh, no, thank you.

[01:17:00]  I've read it  It's just like most people  Yeah well that's who I was talking about  When I was talking about  Paul McCartney's mother  You didn't hear me know  She listens to Breakfast with the Beatles  That's right  You didn't hear him sing  Hey Jill  I wouldn't be surprised  If I did  Cut it out boys  Thank you Kirsten  Let's say hi to Matt in Philly  Hey Jill  Get a tattoo  Hey Jill  What's up Matt  We'll take a bad word 
[01:17:30]  And make it worse  Wee-member  Alright let's say hi to Matt in Philly  Matt you there?  Yo what's up guys  What's up?  I got some background on that German chicken fucker movie  He was actually the first one to get the bird flu  Car crash  Wow  Wow  It hurts man 
[01:18:00]  It sounded better on the phone lines there  Said we deserve the bird flu if we're fucking chickens  Yeah  Yeah  Quick line it would have been nice  It would have added to the program  Cockpit audio  Oh thanks Anthony  I saw you looking around  Bewildered for a second there  Well that guy just took me out of my game  Took you out right out of his nose  Right out of his nose  He just like pulled away from the mic  He just started looking around  Like what?  How am I going to  I was thinking just like that pilot 
[01:18:30]  How am I going to land this thing?  Where was I?  Our wheels are sideways  Right  Cockpit audio  Just minutes after JetBlue took off from Burbank, California  Heading home to New York  The pilots knew they had a serious problem  Gear is not retracting  We have 145 on board  In audio tapes we obtained from the FAA  We hear how both the pilots and air traffic controllers  Work together during three tense hours  To land the plane safely  Three hours  There's a possibility 
[01:19:00]  I repeat possibility only  That the nose gear may be tucked 90 degrees off center  Incredibly the best way to confirm  Was to fly by the airport tower  And actually have the controllers  Make a visual check of the landing gear  What did you see on the gear?  From the tower perspective  The gear was canted 90 degrees to the left  Instead of the tires being aligned down the runway  Thank you  That's what we needed to know  We'll get back to you  What?  Alright  Well thank you  Wheels are cocked  Cantered 
[01:19:30]  What did you say?  Cantered 90 degrees  I don't know  I don't know what that means  What does canted mean?  I hope it means straight  That was the pilot  That said okay and thank you  Yeah  Okay thank you  He found out from somebody else  That his wheels are  Yeah he saw that the gear were retracting  So he thought it was either a bad indicator light  Something you know they could deal with  Or that they are cocked 90 degrees  Wrong  So they fly by the tower  So the tower can actually look at the wheels  And see that they're fucked up 
[01:20:00]  And they just told him  Your wheels are fucked up  And he goes  Okay thanks a lot  Thanks for that info  Listen how smooth he was  He was just taken off from LA  Going to New York  Yeah  And that's when they found out  So what's even more fucked up is  Okay either these people are going to die  Or they got to land a plane  And still be in LA  And they got to get on another plane  Yeah yeah yeah  You don't even get to go where you were going  Yeah and almost die at home  Yeah like why wouldn't he just  Because they flew around for hours  Yeah  Sort of  Why wouldn't they have just flown to New York  At least I could die or not die home 
[01:20:30]  I don't know if it's good for the aircraft  To do about 500 miles an hour  With your front gear down  I don't know  I might aerodynamically  I'm not a  I'm not a  That could cause other problems  I assume  Yeah  I backed it up a little bit  Listen to that  It was canted 90 degrees to the left  Instead of the tires being aligned down the runway  Thank you  That's all we needed to know  We'll get back to you with the plan  The plan  Burn off fuel to lighten the plane 
[01:21:00]  And bring it down  Back wheels first  Slowly lowering the nose gear  We do request emergency equipment  To be standing by  At this time  This is an inbound emergency aircraft  Plenty of sparks and smoke  But not a single injury  That guy is the shit  God love him  God love that guy  Like it's just these pilots are  Why isn't that guy  In our consciousness  Yeah  He should be a household names dude  Yeah  There are people that work at a deli  That I've seen lose their mind  When the slicer breaks  You know 
[01:21:30]  What the fuck  I got sandwiches  Bernie  Fix this fucking  This guy  His plane is fucked up  He's got a hundred and some odd people behind him  Alright thanks for the info  We'll get back to you  And the thing is  He didn't have to be that cool  No  So that's legitimate  That's sincere  Righteous coolness  Coolness  Cause no one hears  Exactly  He couldn't be like  What the fuck  Nick  Oh shit  Oh no  Does anyone know what we do  When this happens  No  He just  Alright  Oh 
[01:22:00]  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  Damn  I saw a movie once  They dropped Charlton Heston through the roof  Can someone do that  So I don't have to fly this fucking thing  Cause I don't have a clue  How you deal with a situation like this  Ladies and gentlemen  Is anybody here not landing a plane with a wheel  Just come on up to the front  Can somebody hijack this plane so we have an excuse for this moment 
[01:22:30]  Ladies and gentlemen  We just got information  Our wheel is canted  90 degrees  It's turned  90 degrees  To one side  So we're going to land this thing  It's either going to be a little bit of sparks  And we're going to be fine  Or we're going to be  On a 500 mile an hour sit and spin  So I'll just sit back  And I'll get back to you  That's what I'm going to do  Get back to you  Excuse me  Stewardess  What the fuck does canted mean? 
[01:23:00]  That would be the  Yeah  Ladies and gentlemen  I thought we had a problem  But apparently we don't  The wheels just seem to be canted  Which I guess is fine  I'm going to whisper  Excuse me  I don't want to  What the fuck is canted?  I notice a lot of people working on PCs out there  Could someone just punch up dictionary.com?

[01:27:00]  Saddam Hussein's on trial  Today's the first day right  Yep  I guess the trial started with him refusing to say his name  He's not cooperating  Was that true?  At all  At all  Well we got some audio here  Let's listen in  What happened today was supposed to be  The beginning mostly administrative  The panel of five judges  Was receiving the defendants  Asked all of them  For their names  And was trying to see  If in fact each one of them  Had assigned a lawyer  However when Saddam Hussein himself 
[01:27:30]  Came into the courtroom  He was led in by  Two Iraqi guards  Wearing flat jackets  He immediately refused  To even acknowledge  The judge's questions  He said  I don't recognize this court  I don't recognize the body  That has authorized you  And he started out by asking the judge  Who are you?  I want to know who you are  The judge was very determined  He kept asking him again and again  Look you'll have your chance to speak  Just right now please  Give me your name  Tell me who you are  State it in full  Saddam continued to say  I don't recognize this injustice 
[01:28:00]  And he refused in the end  To give him his name  And then after six attempts  The judge told him  Well just sit down  And then they went on to discuss  With other defendants  Some of whom were also defiant  And are refusing to cooperate  With this court in any way  The judge however  Went on to say  That Stomp was accused  And the other defendants  Of murder, torture, rape  And said that they face  The possible death penalty  If convicted  Wow  How dumb is this judge  That he wouldn't even know  The guy's name  He's in the papers 
[01:28:30]  How horrified  Hey, it's Ross  How horrified are they, man?  They must be horrified  Of this dude, man  Yeah  Because like you said  You know  He's going to be back in power  And he's going to remember  All these people  Yeah, no one wants to really  Stick it to him  Why are we there  Messing around with these people, man?  Just let them  Just leave that boy alone  I hope when they find Osama though  That they don't find him  The same way they found him  I just hated the way  They found Saddam  Like I just didn't want  To feel sorry in any way 
[01:29:00]  Now we do  You know  And you just feel bad for him  And I just hope they don't  You know  They should just put a collar  Around Osama's neck  And poke him with a stick  Make him like a bad dog  Just so we can  Be afraid  Now we feel bad for him  You know what I'm saying?  Just so we can be afraid  Like Saddam looks like  A little old dumb man  Just a funny little man  Now you know  And you feel all sorry for him  Yeah, but that's like a scam  Like that mob boss  He used to walk around  In his robe  It was all a scam  You know  He's still  He's got it all together  This guy  What are you kidding me?  You don't think he's running  People run shit out of prison 
[01:29:30]  He definitely has it together  What they're talking about  Is how they found him though  In the hole  With the beard  He didn't shower  He looked pathetic  When they pulled him out  The first time  I don't think he's trying  To act like he's  No, no  He's just like  You know  Just to see him  In this position  But boy  If he ever gets back  To something  It's a damn  Over Johnny  Shame  Hey we all skipped over something  We gotta back up a bit  Jeremy in New Jersey  Go ahead  Yeah, what's up guys  Hey  Listen  How stupid is boss  He goes on his fucking honeymoon  While his wife's on a friggin period

[01:52:30]  Every fucking way he does  You know what  Do you leave weddings  You're going  You think Donald Trump  Has the blue  The blue flame cans  That's what they have  At Motel 6  For the buffet in the morning  And I'll tell you  Something else  Motherfucker  Let me tell you  Something too  I'll tell you  Something else  The president sent me  Something  Look at that  From the president  And his wife  And don't  Don't  Don't  Don't  That's from the president  Wow  He thought you were  Going to do it  Don't fucking do that  Why is he sending that  Because I invited him  He couldn't make it 
[01:53:00]  And he sent me a card  President Bush  He did not invite  The president  Read the fucking thing  Stupid  Congratulations to you both  On this wonderful day  Your marriage is a celebration  Of your love  And commitment to each other  He never even saw this  May this deep  And meaningful bond  Provide strength  And friendship  In the years ahead  We send our best wishes  For a lifetime  Of happiness together  Sincerely  George and Laura Bush  Have one for me  And tail  That's all you need to do  To get an autograph  From the president  Good luck  On her special 
[01:53:30]  And you  If you fucking write him  And invite him to your  To your wedding  They'll send you that  Here's a couple  But here's the thing  Hold on  I'm going to back up  A little bit  Alright  You didn't even invite me  To your wedding  Because the wedding  Was in Canada  I probably  Yes I probably  Would have went  Okay let me  First  Before you jump in  I probably  Would have went  To the wedding  Let me  Let me explain  Dude we get  A lot of time off  On this show  Stop before Patrice  I probably  Would have went  And I'm not even kidding  This is what we did  Trying  Trying to save money  For people  We had a wedding 
[01:54:00]  In Edmonton  Because of her family  Right  They're off  In Edmonton  So we said  You know what  Instead of making people  Fly across country  And to Edmonton  Wait a second  How about you explain  This to your best pal  Wait a second  Stop  Stop  You know what  Will you stop  Don't let this son of a bitch  Keep on with this horse shit  Because let me  Let me retort  Can I retort  Can I retort  Can I finish  Can I finish  I'm taking myself  Out of the bit  For a second  I'm telling you right now  I probably  Would have went  To the wedding  But I wasn't even  Invited  So then I'm like  Well I'm not invited  To the wedding 
[01:54:30]  But I'm going to  Go to some  Comedy pub  For a fucking reception  A month later  Okay so we got  Your side  Now let me finish  Alright go  So we had a wedding  In Edmonton  I said instead of making  My friends fly  And put that money out  And ruin the weekend  Shut up  I'm going to have  The wedding there  For her family  A party in New York  And a party in LA  So we don't make people  Fly all over the country  Alright is that  Is that being  A little considerate  Is that like  Yes or no  Is that being considerate  Towards people  I'll say this  Yes or no  If you explained it  To your friends 
[01:55:00]  You didn't explain that  To me  What do you mean  Explain it to you  It's quite obviously  We're getting married  In Edmonton  And throwing a reception  Party in New York  So the people  Don't have to travel  How about a quick  Call or email  I'd invite you  But I'm trying to  You know  We didn't invite  It wasn't  The wedding  Was for her family  The receptions  Were for fucking  Ralphie did the same thing  I didn't want any  Of your comedy friends there  And that  Bullshit  Patrice  Because it was her special day  And when you guys  Get together  I'm kind of an outside  I'm kind of an outside member  I'll be honest 
[01:55:30]  But you guys get very vicious  Within the comedy circle  And she didn't want any of that  On her special day  You're wrong  You're wrong  You're wrong  It was my idea  He's been serious the whole time  But then he just goes  Because you guys  And I'll tell you why  I'll tell you why  I'll tell you why  Because we were at that steak dinner  And Bonnie saw a preview  Of what it would be like  At the wedding  So first of all  One friend  Is allowed to her family's house  And that's why she had to control  We didn't go to her family's house 
[01:56:00]  It was her family's place  In Edmonton  It was three hours  From her family's house  Stupid  Here's another thing  It was three hours  From her family's house  All of a sudden  Right  This is so important  That okay  He's saving us the trouble  Yeah  Of his wedding  Right  Of traveling to Edmonton  But why isn't he saving us  The trouble  Of his reception  If he didn't want to  Cause us any problems  And save our monies  And save our time  Right  Why is now  Is he trying to  Monopolize this time  And why is he upset  That you didn't come  To the cupcake reception  Well because  Keep calling it the cupcake 
[01:56:30]  Whatever  Here's the thing  Here's the thing  Giant cupcakes  First of all  Why am I upset  Because I haven't been in studio  So I haven't let this out  I was upset about  And that was another  Little gig too  So have these guys  Come in and explain  Why they responded  And then go  I didn't respond  Cause I wasn't sure  If I was gonna make it  Okay so am I wrong  Because 930 at night  On a Tuesday  You know  Call me a wimp  That is why  I didn't go  It's rough  Because 930 means 1030  It really does  By the time everyone  Gets there  And settles in  That's rough for me  930 is bedtime 
[01:57:00]  I'm already in bed  Besides I was at  At a really nice dinner  With my agent  And my girlfriend  Yeah  I know  And I had to get her home  Was your publicist there too  You know how boring  Did they have the little blue flame cans  Where you were eating  How many weddings have you been to  How many weddings have you been to  Instead of having a cupcake  I had at a quarter house that night  You've been to two weddings  Okay  A buffet has to win  Do it again  No I ain't doing it again  I had a really nice dinner with my agent 
[01:57:30]  Let's just put it that way  This is what Bonnie's doing  He's upset  No  No  Okay here's another thing too  No  Are you crazy  I know  Are you crazy  Patrice is absolutely right here  I'm going to correct you  A man doesn't do that  A man doesn't do that  Alright boss  Correct  Correct  Hey Patrice listen  Here's the thing  Anthony  I mean  My party in LA  I got upset about  Because people said they were coming  Or didn't  Or jackasses that come without a gift 
[01:58:00]  You know  You never  I've been invited to weddings  Where I didn't even go and sent a gift  But wait a second  That's only because of class  Bonnie had her party in LA  People didn't show up  She wasn't pissed off  It was me getting pissed off  And my friends  She goes  Just try to have fun  But my friends  That who I thought  You know  Some didn't respond  Some didn't come  Some showed up without gifts  You know what  It's a little bit  It takes a little class  Do you know how we  Do you know  Don't use a comic booker  Don't use a comic booker  Don't use a comic booker  Don't use a comic booker  No  No  Is that  Opie do you know  Holy shit  Are you kidding me

[02:02:30]  To fucking do with it  Nothing to do with it  Alright  Bobby said  Call Patrice  He's a good friend of yours  Talk to him  This way you don't  Harbor resentment  And that's how you deal  With things  You don't deal with it  By burying it in you  And then explode in Brazil  You fucking deal with it  Okay  You know what my girl said  She was sitting in the truck  When he first called me  She heard me talk  At the end of the conversation  She said  This is my girlfriend  What is that bitch shit  Wow  You know what  Okay  That was a girl  That's coming from a 
[02:03:00]  Black chick  That's probably a thug  Anyhow  Who gives a fuck  What they think  That was a girl  Alright  We don't give a shit about  That was a girl  Picking on girls  And then she opened the window  Then she opened the window  And spit cum out of her mouth  Right  Like that  Fuck that chismaga  Who gives a fuck  What your girl said  And she's fucking you  Then she's got problems  Anyhow  You should love your girl  She's fucking you  How can you not love  Anybody that fucks you  She's a wonderful person  But this is  At least you got a phone call  You don't call me  So that proves  I'm not a good friend of yours  I did call you  I did call you  Wait here's another 
[02:03:30]  On a national talk show  Listen to me  Fucking jackass  I did call you  And know what else you did  What  Did they  Did they  Listen shut up  Shut up  What guy says  Do you know  No because I remember  He remembers everything  Fuck you  Opie remembers everything  I've never seen  Such a weasely turn  For the worst  Can you shut up  In my god damn life  I call Opie the next day  Right  The next day  He goes  He apologizes  He goes  You know what  Maybe we'll go out  I'll take you guys out  For sushi tonight  For dinner  The day after  Of course  He fucking blew me off again

[02:04:30]  In this situation  Is to say  It's Bonnie  It's Bonnie  But it's not  I know  But your best defense  Would be to say  Because you're coming off  Like a woman  Yeah  I'm coming off  I'm coming off  As a guy who has feelings  That fucking  Oh my god  You don't want to start with that  The guys  That I have grown up with  That I have known for years  Okay first of all  Would look at this like  Anthony  Like  Alright dude  Whatever  You're Italian  Wait shut up  A real guy would not even know 
[02:05:00]  How to be mad about some booze  Right  Okay  Invitations out of your pocketbook  How dare you  Not RSVP  He pulled it out of his purse  He pulled the invitations out of his purse  Okay first of all  I don't even know what the fuck RSVP still means  It's like  That's something  Ask your brilliant girlfriend  Well someone on the instant feedback  Had what RSVP meant  And if Eric could find it again  Where is that?

[02:05:30]  Alright  That's funny  I guarantee behind closed doors  Wait  When he was with Bonnie  You were shedding tears over this  No I wasn't  Little tear in your eyes  You were hurt  You probably had to hold you gently  And rub your head  She rubbed his head  She kept needling his ears  Cause Richard emotionally  He needs  He needs  Like stability  I use  Good go  Listen  You really do  He needs  He needs to be pushed in a certain direction 
[02:06:00]  You guys are all fucking  You've had a tumultuous life  You're all Santa's broken toys  Fuck you  You've had a tumultuous life  Early on  And now you're looking to  Make up for it  First of all  What does tumultuous mean?  Huh?  Tumultuous  What do you mean?  A little shaky  Shaky  Yeah  And now  Now you're looking to make up  Okay can I explain something  With this stability  That it's like a TV  That was the first  It's like the show friends  You think it's gonna be all better  Yeah  It's not Voss  You still cry yourself to sleep 
[02:06:30]  Except for now  Bonnie rubs your head  Are you talking about  Are you out of your mind?  You're talking about covering a pain in life  I never cover a pain  You don't  My pain is outwardly  Banned  Everybody knows my fucking pain  That's right  Alright  Hold on  Adam said that you had a great line  I want to acknowledge a great Voss line  Adam  Yeah  Go ahead real fast  Patrice  How do you let fucking Voss  Call your girl  A jizzmonger  And fucking let that slide  Well listen  Here's the thing  I don't  This is why I didn't  This is why I didn't  Because my  My only 
[02:07:00]  Defense would be to him  To call his wife that  And I  I'm not gonna call his wife that  And I know the context  Because we  Listen  We joke like that  Yeah  If he called my girl a jizz  Later he's gonna go  Listen I didn't mean to call that shit  So it's no  It's no need for me to like  Go  Right  Because I know  You know what I'm saying  You know where it's coming from  I know it's coming from  So that's why I let him get over with that  Because my only thing  And my thing is  I'm not gonna call his wife that  Because he loves his wife  And he's in that unhealthy love  Where he's bringing up  That he brings 
[02:07:30]  See I have  And another thing dude  Whoever the caller was  See  I'll call my own girl a jizzbag  But that means I love her  He cannot separate  He still hasn't  Grown to that level  Where he can separate  His girl being a hoe  And his girl being  Like  Somebody he loves  He's  He's  He doesn't know  How to be in love  Anthony  That's why he's on some  RSVP  And you didn't do  And do do do do do  This is new stuff  He's actually excited  About this new feeling he has 
[02:08:00]  And it's called bitch  He was excited to come in today  To get payback  No it's not payback  You had the invitations  And everything  Oh already  Let's get the guys in here  And they can tell you to your face  Why they didn't show up  After they said they were  Okay I also brought the  What do you call it  He didn't even have to search  Through his purse  He knew exactly where  There was only six things in there  His effing purse  He brought a purse  Here's Ben Sparks  Who said he was going to  The reception at Caroline  And you would think Ben would be there  There was free liquor  Wait a minute 
[02:08:30]  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  I was probably the first one  To respond to these guys  But that night  I talked to you  Because you were supposed to  Come on the show the next day  And I said  I'm going to try to make it  But it's tough  Because it's 9.30  He said  Oh don't worry about it  I talked to you about  5 o'clock that afternoon  You're right  But on the invitation  It said 9.30  Three months earlier  I know  But it's  I was being nice to say  I was going  It's hard 9.30  I was being nice to invite you  Here's the thing  We didn't think it was a real party  Where you were doling out money  And I thought you were doing  I thought you were doing stand up  Here's the thing  Here's the thing 
[02:09:00]  You guys  When those invitations  They charge me $7,000 of cupcakes  I know  And I had  Here's the thing  Those things were as much  As an imitation  $7,000 cupcakes  You fucking idiot  And the only thing they had special  Was extra frosted  Giant frosty cupcakes  Here's the thing  Stats  Shut up  Those things when they were sent out  Look like any other  We got them from the wedding invitation  Store  So they're exactly like any wedding  It's either yes or no  Is it true that in the middle of it  Kevin Meaney came in  And did some time  Do the car crash on yourself 
[02:09:30]  Come on  But here's the thing  When you're planning this shit  Listen  If you couldn't make it  If you knew  You fucking just say no  It's not a heartbreaker  You know you're right  And you know what  He didn't even have it set up  Don't receptions have like  Your friends say  Hey man  Congratulations  That do  Deadly do  All that horse shit  All of a sudden  He's trying to make this  Some regular event  In L.A.  In L.A.  It was  In L.A.  The people did it  In L.A.  Where  Her  Friends  Are  My friends were there too  Norton was there in L.A. 
[02:10:00]  I had a lot of my friends  It's preponderance of the evidence man  You should realize by now  Your friends are awful  Compared to Bonnie and her friends  Guilty  My friends were there  Gullop was there  I guarantee  You wanted at Caroline's  To  Everyone to make a circle  With their gifts  And they're in the middle  Sitting next to each other  Handing their gifts over  One by one  Like good fellas  And admiring the gift  And their friends  At the same time  Because all the good stuff  Happened where she  Where it was happy for her  The real stuff  All the real stuff  The phony Caroline's thing  That they did  I put that together 
[02:10:30]  It had nothing to do with her  Right  You know what  You're speaking of shit  You don't know  I was in charge of New York  I made the mistake  Of going to Caroline's  And not saying I have anything  It gets Caroline's  It should have just been  In a reception  But boss  I deal  And that's why Bonnie  Didn't want to come in today  Because she really hates us now  No she doesn't  She had to see you cry  Behind closed doors  No  She has no respect for them  That's right  That's right  She's like  Well  That didn't take long  If you want to still be friends  With that  I can't keep you on  Because I'm getting chest pain  It's our fault  In a woman's mind  That's our fault 
[02:11:00]  She is  Slowly  But surely  She is Yoko Onuin  Yeah  Rich Voss  How long have they been married?  How long have you been married?  And already  She's alienating you  From the friends  She's alienating your friends  And emotionally  He doesn't know how  I'm allowed to still talk  To Patrice and Jim  So you're wrong  He doesn't know how  He's wearing through you a bone  Voss doesn't know how to combat that thing  Because you know what it is?  Voss has never cared for a woman  In like 25 years or something  He doesn't have that connection  So everything she does 
[02:11:30]  He's going to say yes to  But he doesn't have an identifying madness  To say no  He doesn't know how to say no to her  He doesn't know how to keep his goddamn time  It's the fear that if he says no  He's afraid of his own life  Here's the thing  He's 100% wrong  It's not her  She told me to let it go  Not even to bring it up  To let it go  She told me  She told me  Are you guys going to have a baby shower?  At Caroline's?  No we're doing that one at the cellar  With Lou  You're going to have another kid 
[02:12:00]  I know it  With apple juice instead of wine  Alright Ben  So that's your excuse?  I told Rich that day  And the other thing was  But it's that day  Let me talk  That day you don't think  This was planned in a bit  It was at Caroline's  I figured you were doing it for free  You were doing stand up  Everyone  I bet you everyone else  That was a mistake  But the imitations  Were letting  He keeps blowing that off  Like it was just a little thing  But still  But still  Those were imitations  Hold on  We got two  We got six people  That were invited to this  In the studio right now  How many people thought  It was a serious wedding reception? 
[02:12:30]  Oh  Nobody  No one's raising their hand  I thought it was a  Plotage  Get together  A little  Hey we got married  Let's get together  Caroline's  And laugh a little bit  And have a drink  And why did we send out  Real invitation  You know what it was like  After  You know  You know on New Year's Eve  When they have the big party  Here in Times Square  Yeah  And then it goes to  The other time zones  And by the time you get to L.A.  Who cares  Everybody's already celebrated  They're in bed 
[02:13:00]  Right  That's what yours was  The L.A.  New Year's Eve  Let's say this was at Club 21  Or whatever they call it  What did they make it to  What did they call it  What day did they get married  Exactly  September 17th  No one knew  September 17th  And when was this party  What's it called  And when was this party  I don't know  I'm going to tell you  How it went again  In the house  No  You can't even know  I brought you  You don't know  You saw her playing  The L.A. thing  He said  Should I do the same thing  With my friends  And she went like this 
[02:13:30]  You can try  You know what  You can give it a shot  If you want  I mean  I think it's useless  I think you should go on ONA  And just promote it  And all right  You can try  You're just going to be  Disappointed Richard  That's  We got Steve in studio  Okay let me be for it  Steve  This weekend at Rascals  I'll take a vote  On stage  When I'm in Montclair  At Rascals this week  Of what the audience thinks  All right  Or when I'm at Bananas  November 9th and 10th  I'll take a vote there 
[02:14:00]  All right go ahead  Very good  Is that where you're having  Your baby shower  You already used that one  Stupid  I'll be  No that's the menu  For us  Bananas  Bananas  Oh you'll definitely  Be there then huh  Hey  There's no coming for it  I shot myself in the head  Steve  Steve you responded  And said you were going to this  Yeah I did  I did  And at the time  It was  I think everybody else  Had decided that they were  Going to go  And I'm not  And the reality is 
[02:14:30]  I didn't realize  A helicopter shot him  With a tranquilizer dart  Yes  And I fell down  And they were tagging him  Yeah  It was unfortunate  And I didn't think  When the actual day  Rolled around  And I realized  How late it was going to be  I thought to myself  Holy shit  This is going to be a rough one  And then I thought  I saw it  And I realized  It's Caroline's  It can't be anything serious  I didn't realize  That's what we always thought  I didn't realize  It was a huge formal thing  Had I actually known  That it was a huge  You know  A huge expense gone out  I never would have  Without a doubt  That's what  All kidding aside  We all thought Caroline's 
[02:15:00]  How serious could this be  Steve summed it up perfectly  And just because  You sent out some cheap invites  They weren't cheap  Those things are real invitations  Shut the fuck up  They're not cheap  It ended up like  The party Fredo  Was trying to throw  For Michael in Vegas  When he got there  All right  Get out of here  Get out of here  Come on  Move  I don't know  What's wrong  Master Pope  Oh the one in the first one  Yeah  Yeah  When he comes in  They open the door  Hey  Come in Rich 
[02:15:30]  Get rid of the girls  Get rid of the band  All right  Come on  Clear out  And that's what we should have  Said to him about Bonnie  Don't ever take sides  With anyone  Against the family  Against the family  That's right  Pussy  All right  Master Poe in studio  All right  How you doing Rich  Listen  I went to LA  And I did go to  Ralphie May's party  Exactly the same  He got married somewhere  Wait  He got married somewhere else  And threw a reception in LA  Right  Right  You didn't go to his wedding  You went to the party  Right  Exactly  I went to the reception  All right  And I had all the intentions  Of going to this reception  At Caroline's 
[02:16:00]  But I didn't know  How serious it was  Number one  Number two  Number two  Is I have to get up  At four o'clock in the morning  To be here  By five o'clock in the morning  To make sure that  You know  How many comics  Come in here  At six or seven o'clock  In the morning  That work till one or two  And one day  Oh you know what  I still gotta go  We're doing you guys a favor  Oh please  Let me tell you  You fucking jackass  All right  You're fucking fishing for comics  They're all blowing you off  Listen to me  All right  Oh really  You want to see  You want to see Ben's voicemail  All right  So do I want to see the voicemail 
[02:16:30]  Yeah let me look  Here's the thing  One day  One day  Damn it again  One day  Listen  One day  So you had to go to work  A little tired  Oh  You know what  You guys are such geniuses  You could have pulled through it  Right  You got so much going on  Let me tell you something Rich  You can sit here  I don't blame you at all  I knew you weren't coming  After one in the morning  And then come into the show  You could sit there  And snore  And the show will go on  Which he has done by the way  I know  We got video of you sleeping on our show 
[02:17:00]  Because me and Opie and little Jimmy Norton are doing the show  We can't show up after being out one in the morning  The show wouldn't go on  Unless it's the Rolling Stones concert which was great  Oh how late did you get home  I don't know about midnight  Hawk  Did your agent take you to that one  Or the  1.30  Or the Coldplay show  Yeah  That was really good too  Or  Well you too  All right  Beyond your home opener  I'm fending off thieves in my house 
[02:17:30]  I cannot be at parties  Rich do you realize we're trying to let you off easy  Just accept the fact that we had to go to bed early  All right  All right  Has anyone called you bitch boss  Because  That's what it is  It's bitch boss  You know what  You're feeding all these fucking listeners with fucking ammo  You fucking  They would never do photoshops of your reception  I know the people at Wackbag  And I defy you to find one photoshop of your party  First of all

[02:22:30]  He had to snitch  I didn't snitch  Don't say I snitch  I brought him in  And plus he needs  Fucking air time  I figured this would get him  On the radio  Alright  Dummy  Listen  I told you that  You are so lucky  You're the foreman  At your job  In the day  That you could call in  And this is the guy  That he called for  Like to help  Exactly  He's his help  Go back to your day job  Garbage man  Alright Bob  Thank you Bob  Thank you for the great advice 
[02:23:00]  Thank you love  Alright we're going to  We're going to wrap this segment up  I guess  Yeah  Obviously there's some resentment  You like the thing about the bush  And there's some anger  There's a picture of you  Falling asleep on our couch  By the way  We do have proof of that  Yeah there it is  Yeah  There's Anthony and I  Yeah that's when you come in at 1.30 in the morning  And then I show up for the show  There you go  That would be me  Opie  Jimmy  Everybody  All three of you aren't going to sleep at the same time  One sleeps  The other two carry the show  That's not a big deal  You get a little shut eye  Just passed out 
[02:23:30]  Okay so  But I wasn't as mad at Opie  I knew you  I wasn't at all  I knew you weren't coming  I just sent you it out of  You know  Respect  Thank you  Alright  Why weren't you mad at him  Because I know he doesn't leave his fucking house  Why would I expect him to leave his house  And I was very happy  And that was a fun time  Was that a fun time  And I had to leave that early  Because I had to get up  We were talking about that in the office  The fact that Opie  Has these relationships  Oh yeah  With management  A lot of times  Over the course of the years  We were talking about that  Not anymore 
[02:24:00]  Well you said that a while back too  Yeah I do have my own problems  He's got these relationships  And gets too close to management  And now  Opie will come in and go  Motherfucker  I got an email from this one  And he goes  Did you read the one from  And then you know  Insert boss's name here  And I go  You know something  No  I didn't even get that email  I was skipping tra-la-la yesterday  He's pissed because  You know  I live my life  In a fashion where  No one is disappointed  Well yeah  Because you're more of a secluded person 
[02:24:30]  You're walking down the street  With a hood over your head  Where no one can see you  That's it  You're in your own fucking  And everybody knows it  And who the hell  Like has  Who the hell  Has their own  Movie going on in their head  Where they decide  That they're not going to  Insult somebody  By inviting them to the wedding  Like why wouldn't he  Just invite us  Yeah  And then we can choose  Not to go  Just like his reception  Yeah  You know  This is how we do have to  You know  Because here's another thing  This is how we have to end this  I do  We haven't asked you this  What were you thinking  When all of us didn't show up 
[02:25:00]  What was I thinking  I'm going  Well maybe they're not showing up  To have good radio  To uh  Well the first thing was  Okay I know they get over early  Be serious for once  Okay I know they're going to get over  You honestly think we're like  You know  Trying to dick you over on purpose  No no  But it's just  When you plan these things  There was a misunderstanding  Obviously  Everyone said it  It didn't sound like  An important thing  Okay say  Because there's a comedy club  So what were you thinking  To you it was the most important thing  It was a very important thing  For my friends  Yeah  We're not showing up  Where you know  So what are you thinking 
[02:25:30]  Just like Bobby said  I was fucking upset  That my friends  Certain people  Didn't show up  Yeah I was upset  Who wouldn't be  Okay maybe  Even if it was a  Fucking party party  Not a party  Without imitations  You'd still be upset  If your friends didn't come  If it was a dumb party  Where it was pinned to tail  On you know whatever  You would still be upset  It was  Alright  No it wasn't  It was a fucking  Cordially invited  To the Voss reception  At the roller rink  Located on  Bell Boulevard  Okay but it has no idea  Where it's at  It has no idea 
[02:26:00]  You know what  It has no idea  It means nothing  Where it's at  It means nothing  Where it's at  Because if Opie  Or Patrice  If Patrice  Do a fucking party  At a deli  And ask me to go  I would go  And if I said  I was going to be there  I would fucking be there  That's it  Okay  You're right  But you know  That's the bottom line  So when you're expecting  When you're expecting  Some certain people to come  We're not used to seeing  The series Voss  Because I went to the steak place  That was fun  And it was producers  And directors  But I told you guys that  And we had to sign our life away 
[02:26:30]  Just to have a fucking appetizer  And you didn't have to come  And you said that  It was like  I'm getting some of my friends together  Kind of a quote  Sort of a bachelor party  I said short of a bachelor party  It was like  Getting my friends together  Before I got married  And then it turned into  Because then you got  The TV thing going  All of a sudden  I'm outside on the sidewalk  And he has to  He has to leave his car  A certain way  For the fucking camera  I'm like  What am I in love with  I thought I came here 
[02:27:00]  With my friends  I did not come there  I swear to God  For the TV show  I came there  Because it was Voss's birthday  And then Patrice  He said that  He called me and said  Listen  Do I have to sign something  And didn't we talk  And I said  He came as a friend  And I said to the people  I said  Look  This is a free party  Because I got that thing  From the gift basket  No I understand  But you were  Okay and I said  They're going to be  Doing this towards a pilot  Hey Voss  You're like  Hold on hold on  We're filming  My exit from the car  Voss is leaving  Filming my exit from the car 
[02:27:30]  And the entrance  The dramatic entrance  Into Morton  Boy that'll make great TV  And they were creating  Like different  Remember it was hot in there  And all that  Did I do that  Did I do that  Creating an atmosphere  Because Voss is all psychotic  And so they were like  Okay let's pretend  Letterman likes a cold  Voss like a hot  Oh no  Trying to add a little drama  To watch him be nutty  Like what the  Did I do that  Did I do that  Or did the fucking producers do it  I had nothing to do  With any of that  All I wanted to do 
[02:28:00]  Was go in there  Have steak dinner  With my friends  And hang out  And it was fun  If those cameras weren't there  That would have been  Really fucking fun  By the way  I'm very tired this morning  Because I  I met Madonna last night  Did you  At a premiere  Yeah  I stayed up really late  To like what  Two  It was really late  Because you know  I had a shot  Madonna  I had a shot  To meet Madonna  Last night  Cool  Do you think  She remembers you  Right now  I don't give a fuck  The guy in the little shirt  Is that what you said  Hey I met this guy  In a little shirt 
[02:28:30]  Last night  But he had to leave  I wanted to fuck him  But he had to get up  At five in the morning  I don't care  I met Madonna  Big fucking deal  You met Madonna  And you have a has-been  You meet Sharon Stone  Madonna's a has-been  Oh please  Whatever  I met Madonna  Big deal  Put it on your resume  Right under E  I met Madonna  Big deal  Now you and the guys  Are whack back  And jerk off together  Madonna on the bubble  For a half a second  And I watched Puffy  Watch a movie last night  For about a half hour  And then realized  That was ridiculous  I put Madonna  On a has-been bubble  Yeah

[02:42:30]  That's how I say it  I mean what about wow  That's totally their idea  Oh there you go  Okay  There's something new  Well and then  There's something new  You know what  I used to do that  In Washington D.C.  Tell them Fred  I used to have people  Tie bandanas around their cars  So that women would  Take their clothes off  In the cars  Dude get with it  Alright well I mean  Give me an original idea  Come on  I mean I know  I used to have my listeners  Tie a bandana around their car  I mean I've done it all  What about going off  On their car  I totally know that's you  Alright okay  Whatever  I gotta go 
[02:43:00]  Please  I don't really want to  Get into discussion like this  He's so delusional  That is really funny  Someone found the clip  Yeah that's something  We couldn't play  On the old show  Because of the gag order  That he placed on us  How do you tie a bandana  Around your car  That's a great one  That's a big bandana  What's the matter  My car has cancer  People throwing frisbees  To their cars  Jump and grab it  God just showing your age man  You can't even tie bandanas 
[02:43:30]  To antennas anymore  It's all hippied out  You honk the horn  Beep beep  Dude  Oh dude  He's so delusional  Oh man  Just admit it  Wow is such an original idea  I invented everything  I've done it all  He even said  I've done it all  Wow  Even the stuff  That's going to be invented  I did already  There's no real idea  To a time machine  Everyone just did it  Killed themselves  I've done it all  I was the first one 
[02:44:00]  To do anything  I cracked  Marconi ripped me off  Robin  Remember  What was that thing called  Dot dot dash dash  Dot Morse code  It was Howard code  Earlier  The guy ripped me off  I invented SOS  Robin  What a complete jackass  He's the guy  Wow  Wow  He invented wow  And it had nothing to do with  Whip him out Wednesday  Wow  It was tying a bandana  Around your car  Thank you Howard  And what were we supposed to do 
[02:44:30]  If you saw  I don't know  He didn't really explain it very well  Of course he's not going to explain  If someone had a bandana  Tied around their car somehow  Girls would get naked in the car  It wasn't even flat  Girls would get naked  Driving  Taking their clothes off  Crashing into a butt  Mr. Robin  I invented a traffic accident  A bandana around an antenna  That reminds me of something else I've heard  It's called a fucking flag  That's not exactly  Somebody's fucking invention 
[02:45:00]  I invented that Robin  They say Betsy Ross did that  I sewed the stars on  It was all me  I don't care  I don't care  I honestly don't care  I don't care  I invented a bandana with me  Kirby and Anthony  The virus is spreading  Thank you for being a friend  Traveled down the road  And back again  You're welcome Rich  You're welcome

[02:46:30]  What's up Jay?  Hey how you doing?  Pretty good Jay  I've got a question  Are you guys going to come up with some new material  When Stern comes on?  Because the whole show is talking about Stern  We didn't mention his name once  The whole entire show is all about Stern  I mean it's the whole entire show  Jay  Jay  Two months from now  What are you guys going to be talking about?  Jay  Jay  Jay  Usually you would make this phone call  After we actually talked about Stern  We just did an hour on Rich Voss' wedding  Your timing stinks  See if you're trying to get under our skin  You would make this call 
[02:47:00]  After we had a rant about Howard Stern  How's your radio show right?  It's always a buddy  It's always a buddy  And then what else did we talk about today?  We started the show talking about  There's a wow promo that we play every Wednesday  Calling out Howard Stern  Because we call him out all the time  Jay  Shut the fuck up  You're not listening to XM  Because your friend has the show  At least be honest with us  You have XM  You have XM  You have XM  You have XM  Admit it  You have XM 
[02:47:30]  Go call  Go up XM  Shut the fuck up  I know you have XM  Because you said  Is that all you guys are going to do?  That means you listen  Go call up Howie now  You're not listening for the first time  Douchebag  Call up Howie now  Call up Howie and go  Hey Howard  It was so cool  I got through to  Click  Okay  Robin with the news  When are you going to realize  That Howard Stern's a pussy  We call him out on a regular basis  And he has nothing  So shut the fuck up Jay  Let Jay  Jay  Let Howard fight the battle 
[02:48:00]  But he's not going to fight the battle  Because he can't  Bye bye Jay  It was fun  Have fun  Sorry boys  I know you don't want to commit to  Liking us over Howard  So it's okay  I've never been on house  Boy he's like Sybil  He just  Man  He just almost killed  The fucking  Everybody in here  And he goes  Don't worry guys  It's like  All I'm saying is I understand  You got great fucking range  I understand  I understand  Wow what are we going to do  In three months 
[02:48:30]  What are we going to do  Oh my goodness  How about what we've been doing  On this platform  Satellite Radio  For over a year now  For over a year now  Entertaining people  Having fun  And getting new listeners  Every day  More than Howie  Will certainly have  When he gets on radio  On satellite radio  Right Patrice  We understand  Hey did you hear our stories about  I really do want to like  Don't even bother you  It just remains neutral 
[02:49:00]  Yes remain neutral  When you told your Brazil stories on Stern  Did you have as much fun there as you did here  When you told the same stories on that station as you did here  I told Obi when I first came  It's like  Yeah  Am I supposed to call your house and tell those stories  Like I'm in the business  Dude this is the difference between the two shows  We never told anyone not to go do other radio shows  Can I say something  We have never said that  I have enough balls to say this  I will  I'm telling you  This is amongst friends  It's like this  I went on those two times to talk about it 
[02:49:30]  It was like okay  It's like doing Letterman  And doing another show or something  It's like okay  I went on Stern  Did that  But I'm like look  You got it  He ended up calling me like on the air  It's like  Hey what's that fat comic that goes to Brazil  And I know here I'm Patrice O'Neal  The fat comic who goes to Brazil  But it's like there  It's like you know  I'll be like some  I have to be like a dude  Like some  You know I have to have a place  Sort of  And I can't get to talk  And have fun  You know what I'm saying  So it's 
[02:50:00]  It was Stern  It was Stern was fun  But  Yeah  This is like my home  So Stern  You two are like little school girls  Looking at him  Listening to his  Rationalization bullshit  Okay  Listen if Stern called you tomorrow  And said come in Friday  Would you do it  They've called me a couple of times  It's just I go look  I do  I do O&A  Okay  But with us  That is absolutely not a problem  Look  I know but  There are certain comics  There are certain comics  That are loyal to you guys too  I mean you don't go  And they get a lot of air time 
[02:50:30]  You're right  You're right  I mean there are certain comics  When I did it  There was no  And here's the deal  Radio short  Yeah  Yeah exactly  It didn't exist  What about Goomba Johnny  You couldn't do him  I did Goomba Johnny  Like Patrice said  There was no radio to  I would have loved to come on in  And talk about it  For an hour and a half  Just two hours  Talking about Brazil  I needed to get it out  It changed my life  There's a huge difference  Between the two shows too  Howard has to be the funniest guy  In the room  At all times  We understand that 
[02:51:00]  If Voss kills  Patrice kills  We're going to get credit  In the end anyway  Who cares  But as soon as you're  A little funnier than Howard  Then he slaps you back down  And he has to be the funny guy  He's one of the most insecure guys  In radio  Listen Patrice and I  You've got to know when to sit back  And let someone perform  That's very important  So shut up and let me perform  Every comic news is about you guys  When we did those roasts on this show  When I was roasted  And then we roasted Norton  Right  It was two hours  Of just complete fuck  And you guys just sat back  And the mindset is 
[02:51:30]  Hey fuck  You're killing  We don't have to do two hours  We're doing 20 a week  Exactly  And that's because we're secure  With the type of show we do  I mean not trying to be a bitch  It's just like  I'm honest to God  You know what I mean  It could happen  But it's like  I'd rather come here  And like do  You just don't want  The Howie Bridge  To look like  The Queensborough Bridge  Looked yesterday  Just burning  And in flames  And impassable  Holy shit  My god damn it  What time are you doing  The radio check today  Oh Jesus  The radio check  Still doing radio  Yeah I don't know  He's going over there 
[02:52:00]  He said the plug  Did you do  You did the radio check  Don't do the radio check  I never did the radio check  But I don't know  He is a disaster  I did Stern when you guys were off  And I just recently did Brewer  You know that Brewer called me  Like two or three days ago  Uh huh  Like whining and crying  Into the phone  Like you don't call me anymore  And I'm like  It's tough to call him  You know  Why?  Why?  We kind of showed him how to do radio  And then we were trying to get him here  You mean as his own show here?  Yeah we were trying to get him here  Yeah but you know what 
[02:52:30]  Here's the thing  I'm not going to lie to you  He disappointed me personally  Disappointed me big time  Because he's another guy  That I talk to a lot  In my time off  And it's like  What are you doing?  But maybe they offered him more money  And then his excuse is  He didn't want to live under our shadow  And stuff  It's like  We would have helped you  Because obviously  You know he's a great comic  But he doesn't know how to do this radio thing  Can you get me a radio show?  Me and  Hook me up with like  That cowhead guy or something  Like cowhead  Apparently  You could just go over there  To Sirius  And they'll sign up  For a multi-million dollar deal  It's going to be what they do 
[02:53:00]  Where's their address?  Where are they at?  I'll be right down there  Downtown a little bit  I love you  Yeah it's a touchy subject  That whole thing man  That loyalty thing  You're like  Jesus you know  Everybody's in show business  You're trying to  You know  You want to  You want to be loyal  They have absolutely blocked people  From being on this show  And we don't care  We tell people  You know  You want to sell seats at gigs  Or you know  Go over there and do that  Fine  I don't know  But Patricia's saying 
[02:53:30]  There was no other radio  You know  When you guys were off the air  It was probably  The highest point of my career  Which  Well you know  It's like any career  Goes up and down  You know that  But at that point  It was probably the highest point  And I could have probably done Stern  But you know  As being a loyal ONA comic  Listen to me  I could have probably  Done Stern  He was not asked to do  Again he knows  But I was  Jesus  I was you fucking idiot  You wasn't  I wasn't  And you wouldn't have said no  Yes of course I would  He's lying  I said no to man cow 
[02:54:00]  I said no to  I said no to Stern  What are you doing dude  I dropped the coffee again  Yeah all over the console  So we're going to be off the air  In seconds here now  So that starts dripping  In between the cracks  Oh no  Do you spill your coffee  Every fucking time  You come here  That was  That is again  Don't let it get  Under the console  That's impossible to clean  Sorry about that  I like the way  Voss is like  Quietly trying to be  Rebellious  He spilled the coffee  On purpose  To just  To diffuse

[02:55:00]  So there's these guys  They were music majors  In college or whatever  The Kaplan Brothers  Yeah  Went out to Hollywood  And they decided  To make a CD  Called Silence of the Lambs  The musical  And we've played  A bunch of tracks  On the show  Absolutely love it  Love it a lot  Now they're touring  With this thing  In small theaters  Across America  And they have a song  That wasn't on the CD  That they just released  I'd love to give out  Their website  But I don't have it  In front of me  Silence  The musical.com  Silence  The musical.com  So now we're gonna  Finally play

[02:56:00]  Getting on my nerves  Hey you in the mirror  With the lovely set of curves  Such a pretty face  Full inviting lips  Multiple tattoos  Childbearing hips  There's a whole lot  Of fish in the sea  But none of those  Bitches are me  Take a chance  Never know  In the end  If you're gonna  Get lucky  Would you fuck me  I'd fuck me hard  I'd fuck myself  So fucking hard 
[02:56:30]  This butterfly  Shed its cocoon  It's spreading its wings  Straight for the starts  Once I come up the meat  I'll be ready  Complete  And I'd fuck me  So hard  Lipstick and mascara  Nipple with a ring  Close to being done  Let me hide my thing  I'd buy me a drink  Get lost in my eyes  I'd flirt and I'd wink

[02:57:30]  So hard  Hey, asshole  Thank you for the straps  Instead, I think  I'll set a trap  I'm probably doomed  But I just got  A brilliant idea  Precious, come here  I'd fuck me 
[02:58:00]  I'd fuck me  Well  I'd fuck me  Till I burn in hell  I'd have me  I'd do me  I'd break me  I'd screw me  And get in the back  Of a car  I'd stop me  I'd chase me  I'd look me  I'd chase me  I won't  That's me  I'm taking  I'd be grateful  From wasting me  Back in my  I'd fuck me  So hard  Ah, there you have it 
[02:58:30]  Silence of the Lambs  The musical  Silence  Certainly do get that  Broadway sound  Don't they?  What do you think?  I like that one  I like it  Anyone with  Jane gum in it  Is good  Is alright  A winner  What's going on  With Hurricane Wilma?  We don't know  It's very strong  Right now  It's heading right  Toward my vacation spot  It's in the water  Right now  That is very warm  It's the perfect  Area for hurricane 
[02:59:00]  That's why it's huge  And it's very  Very powerful  They're saying  This is the strongest  Hurricane of the season?  Maybe strongest  Ever  What?  Maybe strongest  Ever  But it's because  It's down in that  Warm water  Down there  Once it starts  Coming north  It'll die down  A little bit  But  Still a very  Dangerous storm  Headed into the Gulf  But it's going to  Take a quick turn  To the right  Cross over Florida  Could go between  Cuba and Cancun 
[02:59:30]  They're saying  But either one  Could get hit  And then make a  Hard right turn  And go over Florida  You know in terms  Of the atmosphere  And meteorology  This was truly  An atmospheric bomb  That occurred  Overnight last night  I have never seen  Anything like this  Happen in this  Short a period of time  Going from what  Was a tropical storm  We were talking  Just 24 hours ago  To now a category  Five storm  Look at that eye  How clearly defined  It is  It's only about  Four or five miles wide  This is a very  Compact tight woven storm  And that's why  The winds around that  Storm maximum  Wins now at  175 miles per hour 
[03:00:00]  And unofficially  With a millibar  Pressure of 884 millibars  That is the lowest  Ever on record  In the Atlantic Basin  The track of the storm  Takes it east of Cancun  Southwest of West Cuba  Sometime overnight  Tonight or Thursday night  Into Friday morning  As a category four storm  Then what happens  Is notice that sharp term  Well why would that happen  Why does it keep moving north  We expect the jet stream  To pick that storm up  And then shift it  To the east and northeast  Anywhere from Fort Myers  Through Naples  Punta Gorda  Again also  Key west down around here  Look for the possibility 
[03:00:30]  Of hurricane conditions  Sometime beginning Saturday  And then continuing on  Into Sunday  Fuck  Yeah  Time to call the travel agent  When do you leave  Well the problem is  I got to land in Miami  Saturday morning  Saturday in Miami  That's  Saturday morning  That's supposed to be  When it's actually hitting  It's over Johnny  That could be a rough one  It's over Johnny  I'm getting out of here Friday  Motherfucker  All right  Anthony  Gamefly.com  Rich was just telling us  You're playing a new video game

[03:19:30]  They started sending copies  They were emailing the shit  To Fox TV  They had listeners  Call up the TV  You know Fox and Mad  And they were trying  To get me fired  And shit  For what  There was nothing  For coming back  And defending your fucking  Dignity in front of  A lot of radio guys  They see their moment  Like this is it  We're going to get  Some national coverage  Hey some national press  Out of this one  This is it  He's a dude from Mad TV  And we almost got in a fight  We got to send it off  To everybody  Yeah  They had dreams  Of being on  Access Hollywood  And The Insider 
[03:20:00]  Their toughness level  Went up so quickly  When you were escorted out  When you left  That's where I have no respect  For what they did  They were talking shit  Well after you left  They talked to shit  And then when it looked like  You might punch somebody  They backed way off  And then when they realized  Security was involved  And they were protected  Then they went after you again  Security  Security  Yeah  Here's the tape  Hold on hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on 
[03:20:30]  Yeah I guess you got to explain  So you did your interview  It didn't go well  You'll be honest right  It kind of sucked  It was one of those  That just didn't go anywhere  So then you're leaving right  Yeah  So they talked shit  As soon as you left the studio  As soon as I left  I got in the car  And I  You know  We listened to the station  And they just start  Ripping into me  And I probably got about  Two blocks  And I told the driver  I said man turn  Turn this shit around  Turn this shit around  That's awesome  And what were they saying  Well they were just like  For instance  Like every time I go on  A radio station  I bring a copy  Of my prank phone calls  On my CD  I'll say yo man 
[03:21:00]  Can you play this  Let the people hear it  And stuff  So dude didn't even  Play the phone calls  But yet he said  Oh my god  The album was just garbage  Then I had my brother  With me  It was just me and him  He said I had a 15 man posse  You know when the interview  Went bad and I left  I said to the receptionist  Nice you know  Calm tone  Listen  In the future  If you want guys  To participate  You should just  Have them be a little bit  Better host  They turned around  And said that I threatened her  And I screamed  You know what I mean  So they just took things  And blew it way out of proportion  Yeah  You know 
[03:21:30]  Like I said  A 15 man posse  It was me and my brother  So they're going back  Into their music  And listen to the  Hack DJ voice delivery  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  We're on the air now  Yeah  You're back  You're back  Oh this is good  They have to play  The fake applause  Because he's back in studio  Are you kidding me  This is a real moment  We're back  We're black on the air  Even if you're doing like  Even if you're doing like  Morning zoo type of radio 
[03:22:00]  You should step out of that  When a real moment  Is about to happen  You're like  Alright he's back  Where's the applause  Where's the applause  But like I said  Before you even get into that  The fucked up thing was  Like I said  People you could log on  And check it out  On the website  And they were only playing  When I was the angry  Black man  They didn't play  When they thrashed me  That's what the news did too  You know what I mean  They just played the one side  So it made me look like  I was just fucking crazy  And angry  And racist  And you know  It was like  Come on man  Play the first half  When you thrashed me for 10 minutes  Yeah  Hold on 
[03:22:30]  Hold on  Hold on  Well you say  When they got six listeners  Hold on  We're on the air now  Yeah  You're back  You're back  Oh this is good  Yeah  Now you know  Radio and TV  Is all about ratings  Let's go ahead  And get some ratings  For you now  You can leave  If you want  Or you can stay  You verbally thrashed me  When I left  You verbally thrashed us  In the hallway  On the way  I didn't thrash you  In the hallway  Yeah you did  The guy came in  I've been doing stand up  For 15 years  I've been doing  Thousands of radio stations  Alright so what happened here  I know the deal 
[03:23:00]  You didn't do diddly on our show  Diddly  Diddly  My brother said diddly  How the fuck you gonna call yourself  A black man Aries  Let a cracker say diddly to you  I don't believe it  And you know what  And he let you off the hook  Because he didn't say squat  And I gotta tell you  On Mad TV  You do a great Bo Diddly  So I don't understand  Why you didn't do diddly  Why didn't you do diddly  You didn't do Shaq  You didn't do diddly  Oh man  He didn't do Shaq or diddly 
[03:23:30]  That's what he meant  What an ass  Back to the table  You didn't do diddly on our show  I didn't like the way you presented it  What are you talking about  You're having a conversation  Here's my point to you  And this is why I turned the car around  And came back  I'm glad you came back  You were thrashing me  And all the listeners heard it  You were thrashing me  So I'd get the freak out of your studio  And go back over there  To the hippity hop rap station  Where they have six listeners  I'm not done  I think I deserve the right to talk  You thrashed me when I left  And I'll respond  Say everything you said on the radio  To my face  Just let him respond 
[03:24:00]  Say it to my face  I love that  That's the key right there  Bravo  Say everything you said  To my face  You're going to be tough  When I wasn't in the studio  I'm back  Say it to my face  Now if the guy had any set of balls  What so ever  He would have repeated  Everything that he had said  Right to your face  Man  Say it to everything you said  On the radio  To my face  Just let him respond  Say it to my face  I'm going to say it to your face  And I'm going to respond  To why I said that  About the hip hop  You walked out in the hallway  And told this kid  That man  I went to the hip hop station  And we got along  I did all my material 
[03:24:30]  That pissed me off  Because you didn't do  Any material on this show  Because the way  That it was presented  How was it presented to you  Let me tell you something  When you do shows  And you're a comedian  And you do impressions  No one likes for you  To just go  Hey  Do this  Do that  No one did that  It can be presented  In a better way  That is so true  That's what I told the dude  That was telling me the story  At the club  I was doing  I was like  Look  I'm going to be honest with you  I know they told it  Hey  We don't want to hear about  Who you really are  Do  Do that impression  Of Clarence Williams the third  Go ahead  Do it  Now 
[03:25:00]  Do it  And every time  You want to say  Nigga  They state  They substitute  Nigga  With a little Richard impression  Do it  That's where a nigga come in  I said do your impression  I completely agree with you by the way  I think it's our job  And aunt and I  To like try to set you guys up  Best we can  Try to feel you out  And make you comfortable  There you go  And it just goes to show you  That's all I want it man 
[03:25:30]  That's all I want it  Radio hacks  When they have to have  A guy come in  And it can't just be a conversation  You can't just talk about  You know  Fucking what's happening in the news  The hurricane  And just like conversation  It's got to be  Plus what they don't understand too man  Is like man in this business  You know  Hey Patricia you know man  You got to eat so much bullshit  On auditions and rejection  And a lot of times  You know you can't always respond  The way you want to  To a casting agent  Producer director  Because that could be your ass  So you got to eat a lot of shit 
[03:26:00]  So when you have a term  Eric is being diplomatic  And he ain't even mention it  As a black man  Yeah  Well I mean  Yeah that too  Because that's what he want to say  Because that's what it is  We got to eat a whole bunch of horse shit  Because we're not smiling  And they want you to  Nobody  If you have any  Just a drop of  Understanding from black people  Don't tell  Just let us have to  Do it  Do your little impression  But the thing that kills it  Is like you know  So if you get a moment  Where you can kind of  Keep a little control  And dignity for yourself  That's important  Right 
[03:26:30]  So again  I would have done it  But he said  Do it  Do it  I'm like  Dude  I go through this shit  To get jobs  I'm not going to  And the reality is  It's a give and take  Like you want to be good  On a radio show  Because that sells the tickets  That's the only reason you're there  Yeah  You know  That's the only reason you're here today  We don't know each other  Right  Yeah  So why wouldn't you  Try to do your best  But if you're feeling uncomfortable  And you're not feeling  Because the atmosphere is strange  That's what's going to happen  And that's the jock's fault  Yeah  That's the fucking jock's fault  You know  We're not perfect 
[03:27:00]  We've  We've had a couple of  Uncomfortable moments  Yeah we've let people down  On our show  Of course we have  Sometimes we're not feeling  The passion for the person  Usually it's intelligent women  Yeah  That's the problem  We have  They sit down  We finally had to admit that  In the office one day  And it's not even like  We're going to go  So bitch  What the fuck  You know  It's just  They sit down and go  Well how are you guys doing  And we just go  We go  We turn into babbling  Oh no  A woman with a brain  Yeah we don't know  What to say  We don't know what to do  Show ho  It's not a whole ho 
[03:27:30]  It'll bring it all down  We're just so used to saying  Show us your tits  Can I guess your age  Can I guess your age  Can I guess your age  Can I show a wiffle ball bat  In your head  Do a wiffle ball bat  No one does it  Yeah show professor  Show us your tits  Yeah hey  But a girl that has  Any type of intelligence  In the studio  We fall apart  The hardest time  We have  That's our  That's our kryptonite  It really is  And we finally had to admit that  In the back office one day  We're like man  We stink when these girls are smart  But you also go on these radio shows  When we go on the road  Nice titties kind of Lisa  When we go on the road  See when a comic comes in here 
[03:28:00]  They sit down  You go on the road  Sometimes you're going in  For one five minute spot  They'll bring you in  So you got to fucking  Song and dance  With them for five minutes  Right  Like you're  You know  They rush in  And rush you to find out  You can't build up any rapport  Any type of thing  So you know  It's bullshit  Here at least you come in  You sit for an hour  Two hours  You know what I'm saying  That's it  And it's worked both ways  With comics on our show  Also  There have been some comics  That have come in  And we're talking about a subject  And we got people in here  And we're all laughing  And they come in 
[03:28:30]  And are incapable  Of adapting to the conversation thing  And just start going into the act  Is that my setup?  Yeah  Hurricane what?  I don't know  We're talking about  When we're in high school  But even if you got five minutes  You know  You can make the most out of five minutes  Again I just say  It's my job to come in  And do my thing  But as host  This is your station  Your gig  Right  You can  In five minutes  We can get something going  You know what I mean  It ain't got to be an hour  It can be five minutes  Oh yeah 
[03:29:00]  It's just all about how you  You know what I mean  In that five minutes  Build that rapport man  Obviously that wasn't going on  Alright let's go back to  The tape here  It can be presented  In a better way  It's your job as the host  You are the host  It is your job as the host  To present it  Where we can do it well  Hang on  Hang on  Just let me say something real quick  We've had every  Every  Every  Major comedian  That has come through  The Miami Improv  And this is a lot  I want you to understand  Why I turned around  Hold on  Let me talk just for a second 
[03:29:30]  As far as people doing impressions  We've had Kevin Pollack  We've had Daryl Hammond  We've had other comedians  That do impressions  And we say  Hey man do  This impression  And they do it  It's no big deal  I wasn't here  When all those people  You just named  I wasn't here  When they were here  So I don't know  What they did  And therefore  I don't care  My point in turning around  And coming back here  Was that you were talking  Very tough  When I left here  Yo my man  I'm from the streets of New York  I know what tough talk sounds like  And if you want to talk about me that way 
[03:30:00]  Do it to my face  I'll do it to your comedy  Say everything that you said to my face  What did I say that was so tough  Talk the way you was talking a second ago  Yeah  I said man  Go down to the hip hop station  Where they got eight listeners  Why don't you go down there  So it's necessary to say  My CD is trash and all that  Because if I had never heard  Hold on  I never heard you see that  I did not use  So if I had done everything  That y'all wanted me to do  If I had done everything  That y'all wanted me to do  The way you wanted me to do it  You would have still said  My CD was trash  I didn't say it was trash  I said it wasn't funny 
[03:30:30]  What did he say  I said it wasn't funny  I know what I said  And we heard you  We heard you  Don't you  Let me tell you  Something  Poodley poo  You don't come here  With your New York  Swindly doo  And kiddly crash  And come in there  And think you can scare me  With your god damn  Movements of your hands and neck  With that  Hip of the gosh  You could tell  He was scared  Shitless  The way he was talking  It's like  You know  Say what you said  And say it to my face 
[03:31:00]  And he's like  Well  The hip hop station  Has got six listeners  What was he saying though  Like  Saying exactly how  That made you want to  Come back  Well when he was like  You know  I said yeah man  I did the thing  At the hip hop station  Had a good time  He goes  Go back to your  Hippity dippity  Rippity rappity station  Where they got  You know  Six listeners  And do your thing  And when he was saying  That he was going  You hippity dippity  You know  He was doing all that shit  But what did he say  In the car  That made you go  Nigga  Turn this motherfucker  He said he said
