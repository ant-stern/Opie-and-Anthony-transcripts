<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Opie's mispronunciation of a song title, the "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" segment (encouraging women to expose their breasts), the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, and preparations for a whipped cream bikini contest featuring Kimmy from *Survivor*.  A recurring gag involved Earl, a show employee threatening to quit during a remote broadcast.  The infamous Bill Buckner error soundbite was repeatedly played, fueling baseball discussions.  The hosts expressed disappointment about unfavorable weather for "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" and had a humorous phone call with Kimmy on her way to the studio, where she recounted an incident involving a listener in his car. Listener calls included complaints about unclear directions to an Earl-related "sticker stop" event.  A country parody of a Stephen Lynch song was played, and the segment concluded with anticipation for Rodney Dangerfield's appearance.  Recurring jokes involved other radio personalities' remotes and listener Dan's inappropriate comments.

The show then transitioned to a lengthy discussion about *Jackass*, audience reactions to its stunts, and the show's perceived responsibility for viewer injuries.  Callers recounted childhood injuries from imitating stunts, including one mimicking Evel Knievel. Another caller, Jay, expressed interest in having Steve-O on the show.  Andrew "Dice" Clay made a brief call-in.  CNN's coverage of a child injured while attempting a *Jackass* stunt was discussed, along with Mick Foley's upcoming book and his related opinions. The "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" took place, featuring Kimmy, with enthusiastic audience reaction.  Numerous interruptions, overlapping conversations, and off-color humor punctuated the segment. Callers shared experiences with "balloon knot action," sparking a discussion about lubrication and pain. Devin Ratray ("Buzz" from *Home Alone*) was a guest.  The hosts repeatedly mentioned Rodney Dangerfield's upcoming appearance and concluded the segment with plans for more whipped cream bikini contests and further discussion of previous topics.

Rodney Dangerfield's arrival was preceded by a sexually suggestive discussion among the hosts about sexual acts, using graphic metaphors.  Callers added to the explicit banter.  Dangerfield, seemingly unaware of the show's raunchy nature, discussed his performances, daughter's labor, and wife.  The conversation included drug references (especially marijuana) and continued sexually explicit discussions, focusing on women in and around the studio, including references to nudity and whipped cream.  Kimmy, the *Survivor* contestant, participated in the whipped cream bikini contest, leading to further graphic descriptions and suggestive comments. Profanity and offensive language were pervasive. The segment ended with more sexually suggestive banter and promotion of Dangerfield's shows.

The final segment detailed a bathroom incident involving Kimmy, covered in whipped cream and sprinkles, requiring assistance from Jim Norton.  Suggestive comments and innuendo followed.  The incident was filmed and briefly posted online, crashing the website. Listener calls offered commentary and speculation.  The show also mentioned a *Project Greenlight* sponsored by Sam Adams beer and a Home Depot promotional segment. A caller performed a country-music version of a Stephen Lynch song.  Further discussions centered on photos of Kimmy and the bathroom incident. Macaulay Culkin made a brief appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Catch a Lickin!  Nice! 1027 WNAW, the latest from the Black Crows.  That's called Lick It.  Lick It. Lick It.  Lick It.  Lick It?  Lick It.  Is that what he was saying?  He was saying Lick It, yes.  Look at me screwing it up the first time out of the box.  You never understand what the hell that guy's saying.  He smoked so much pot.  I dig the Chris Robertson, Anthony.  Is that like caught you looking?  Catch a Lick It?  Lick It. Lick It.  Screwed it up. I can't believe that. 
[00:00:30]  Latest from the Black Crows.  Album Lions out in stores May 8th.  That I did not screw up.  Good job today, W. Ben E. W.  Yes.  It's the O&A Show.  212-757-1027.  What the F is up with everybody today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lick It. 
[00:01:00]  Wow.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Ah, yes, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  See lots and lots of wow stickers out there.  Yeah, we saw a hell of a lot. 
[00:01:30]  Lots and lots of wow stickers.  But the problem is, yesterday should have been Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  We just suck.  We can't get a break.  Yes, we just can't get a break.  It's what, 87 degrees yesterday?  So beautiful.  Walking around the city was nice.  And today, back to windy and just beautiful.  Yeah, I wake up this morning.  I'm out on the streets.  It's 40, 45 degrees.  And then you get the crap from people when you complain, like, that it's cold and windy out. 
[00:02:00]  It's not cold, Dick.  It's not cold.  After yesterday, it's cold.  You can't walk around.  I was walking around yesterday.  You know, you just got the T-shirt on and stuff.  And it's great.  You just walk around.  And even at night.  You know, even when it's at nighttime.  It was nice and warm.  Well, we kind of had, like, a little E-wave, though.  It's not supposed to be 87 yet.  That wasn't a wave.  It was a little ripple.  Ripple.  We had a weather ripple.  And it's gone.  There's something for later on in the show.  A weather ripple. 
[00:02:30]  Ripple.  We had a weather ripple yesterday.  A weather ripple.  I'm just frustrated because today could have been a great Whip-Em-Out Wednesday day.  Yeah.  Incredible day.  Officially, I'd have to say we're still in the preseason phase of Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Until we have a beautiful day like yesterday.  On Wednesday.  You know what preseason baseball is all about.  Even you, Anthony, you're a huge Yankee fan, but you're just kind of taking a peek at  the preseason games when they're happening in Florida, right?  You just take a peek every once in a while.  Wasn't really paying much attention.  But now that the season is here, you know, you're checking the box scores every day. 
[00:03:00]  Goddamn not, Blank.  The hell was that?  Off the glove.  What?  Everyone knows he sucks in the field.  Move him everywhere.  Move him on the bench.  Shouldn't you be playing right field?  No, man.  Shouldn't you use, like, little league rules?  Guy sucks on defense.  You put him in right field, not left field.  Were you getting a little jab in there?  A little Sox jab?  Yes, I was. 
[00:03:30]  What did he say?  Did you see who was in first place in the newspaper today?  Go!  Oh, God!  This is great.  This is great for us Sox fans.  Nothing better.  And we're up in the series this year.  Okay, Mr. April.  Hey, Barney!  Barney!  You see how the Sox are doing?  Oh, that's all right.  This is the best time ever because I listen to you guys.  All you and Rick and Sticky Yankees.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to have fun.  You don't have a leg to stand on until they win a World Series.  Is it October or something? 
[00:04:00]  Two words, Bill Buckner.  I know.  I know we'll have it up.  It gets so easy to say, I know.  I know we'll screw it up.  And you can say it at home.  That old gag, I understand.  But to a Boston fan, all you have to do is say, Bill effing Buckner.  Really?  Bill Buckner!  Listen, I know by the end of the year they'll blow it.  I'm just enjoying it now.  There's nothing more satisfying to me than see what the Sox fans are doing.  What do we got?  We got two Yankee fans.  You're a Sox fan.  I'm a Mets fan.  And what's the thing?  Yankee fans.  Jesus, I'm the old one.  Could you give me a little computer volume?  Because Ben is... 
[00:04:30]  We need to find us something.  Whoa.  I think we just turned on a radio station we shouldn't turn on.  And don't worry, we're not listening to you in queue like you guys do to us, ass wipes.  All right, here we go.  Got it?  Yeah.  So the winning run is at second base with two outs, three and two to Lukey Wilton.  Little roller up along first.  Behind the band!  It gets Bill Buckner!  Here comes Knight and the Mets wins! 
[00:05:00]  God damn.  It's good after all these years.  It never gets old.  It never, ever gets old.  Hey, that's something you don't see ever, eh?  He'll roll up first.  It's like, that's over.  Behind the band!  Yeah, whatever.  Psycho Mark's on the line.  Another Sox fan.  Hey, Mac.  Hey, Mac.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Oh, please.  You guys always need to have the hope there before the huge disappointment at the end of the season. 
[00:05:30]  So I'm happy for you.  It's like having a huge raging member in your pants.  And then it finally explodes right before you get it in.  Not quite.  Because it doesn't feel good at all for your guy.  There you go.  It's more like her dad showing up.  Keith Hernandez thought it was over.  He's drinking a bud and having a cigarette in the clubhouse.  God.  It's like it happened yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  It's like it happened yesterday.  Behind the bag!  It's hard to do it this year.  They go all week.  Oh, how many years?  How many years?  This could be the year.  Don't even start.  There's plenty of people in South America.  Mark, you can't even name three or four of their players for Christ's sake.  No, it's Noma.  Noma.  Noma.  Noma.  That new gook who can throw the ball.  New gook.  Every team has a gook this year.  Anyone else notice that?  What happened to our pastime?  Who knows? 
[00:06:30]  They steal it.  But no, the Sox are going to do fine with you.  You wait and see.  Trust me.  Come on.  All these guys from Japan are all named after, like, cars.  Cars and motorcycles.  Hey, why don't you play the Bill Barker thing one more time from everyone, will you?  Oh, yeah, no problem.  Hey, Mark, by the way.  Mark.  Yeah.  Mark.  Mark.  What?  Will you stop?  No, no, wait.  Wait, wait.  I just had to pop it up. 
[00:07:00]  Will you stop blowing pot smoke under Jeremy's door?  I did not do that.  Oh, my God.  I did not do that.  If you're going to be cool enough to do it after the show, at least a minute on the air.  Oh, is that what Ben said, Ben?  You sneaky little F.  Mark, we're trying.  It's no secret.  We're trying to get Mark back on our show in some form.  And you're not helping your cause.  Stop blowing pot smoke under the boss's door.  I did not blow the smoke. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, but you were scared right there.  I just made a joke.  I didn't do it.  I didn't do it.  It was paid on the radio.  Mark's the only guy that gets fired from this place that's allowed to still hang.  He just hangs out.  He just smokes his pot.  But he doesn't know.  Oh, Mark.  And he still knows the door codes, which is great.  I know this is what makes it cool and stuff.  But, you know, we're trying to get you back.  Stop blowing pot smoke under the boss's door.  Well, can I put, like, maybe hits an acid on his coffee cup?  Call acid. 
[00:08:00]  Hey, Earl takes me shopping in the prize closet every day I come by.  He robbed us.  Well, you guys, I'm trying to remember when it was.  Rob, there's nothing to steal.  He stole everything in the office.  I'll give me that.  I'll take a bottle of Jägermeister.  I'll take a couple video games.  He was doing the impersonation of Rodgers.  All right, all right, all right.  All right, Mark.  Shut up.  All right.  So the winning run is at second base with two out, three and two to Lukey Wilson. 
[00:08:30]  Little roller up along first.  Behind the bag.  It gets so much there.  Here comes Knight in the middle.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:09:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up, Doug?  I spoke to a couple of Red Sox fans from up to Boston.  Yeah.  They only go for, like, for three innings of the game.  They hang out in a bar the first three innings.  They go for the second three.  And then they leave after the seventh and they can go drink even more.  You know, I'll defend the Sox fans, though, because Fenway is in an insane area.  There's just nothing but bars all around it.  Well, also, you've got to remember Fenway stopped serving in the seventh because people get  a little out of control. 
[00:09:30]  Oh!  They should stop serving in the first.  Is that true, though?  That happens?  That's true.  I went to the game a couple of weeks ago.  So you just go for the fifth, sixth, and seventh inning and that's it?  No!  That's not true at all.  You get hammered two hours before the game.  Then you go into the game when it starts and then you get completely hammered and then  you get pissed in the seventh inning.  They really have some of the best bars in America right around Fenway.  Before the game we go to Jillian's where we touch kids and drink.  All right, Doug.  Ladies, guys.  Bye.  I want alcohol. 
[00:10:00]  Oscar.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Man, I was at the game yesterday.  It was like I was in a sushi bar.  There were so many damn Japanese people there.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah, the Japs.  It was more than a Godzilla movie.  I was waiting for the guy with the white hat to start going everywhere with this.  Let me tell you something.  The Japs ruined it.  Godzilla movie.  All right, boys.  Take care.  You know, it's interesting he brought that up because Ben could talk about this.  When the Sox got Pedro Martinez.  Yeah.  Oh, the Hispanic attendance went through the roof.  Didn't even know Boston had many Hispanics.  They came out of the woodworks.  Neither did that.  Check out Pedro when he pitched.  They broadcast it now up in Spanish up there.  They're not a lot of Spanish up there.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  That's all one player could do to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all one player could do to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all one player could do to it, you know, a nationality.  You know, the little mommy standing outside waiting for his car to pull out.  We saw that.  Oh, yeah.  When the midget took us to the game.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yes, boy.  They were all waiting for Pedro to leave Fenway. 
[00:11:00]  They had their flags and everything.  Look at the girls waiting.  That's the thing.  Even when Pedro pitches at Yankee Stadium, they're not there to cheer Boston.  They're just to cheer Pedro.  They have their Pedro stuff, their flags, and that's it.  Mm-hmm.  So there you have it.  Pedro.  There you go.  We're talking about Whippin' Mile Wednesday.  Yeah.  So we're pretty much in the preseason, obviously.  Yeah.  Look at the weather.  The weather's not dependable enough that you're going to get a string of nice Wednesdays.  But it is happening.  We encourage the guys to get their WOW bumper stickers. 
[00:11:30]  You're not going to see it unless you get a WOW on your vehicle.  They're going fast, so send in your self-addressed stamped envelope.  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Yeah.  All right.  And we're going to be at William Patterson University.  Yeah.  Today?  Right now.  Sticker stop.  Who's doing it?  Earl.  Earl.  I can't wait for the phone call.  I thought Earl quit.  Didn't he quit last week?  Nope.  He said he wasn't doing anymore.  There he is.  Here's Earl.  Look at that.  On cue. 
[00:12:00]  Earl.  Yeah, guys.  What's up?  We're doing our sticker stop here at William Patterson College.  Woo!  And there are a lot of wasted people here.  We're having some music sets.  All right.  A lot of wasted people.  You're handing out the WOW stickers.  I'm handing out the WOW stickers.  We'll be here until about 4.30 and we're having a good time.  We're having a good time.  Hey, Earl.  You're going to stay there at least an hour.  That's pretty cool.  Making the effort this week.  We appreciate it.  We always stay an hour, guys.  All right. 
[00:12:30]  We've taken notice that you're putting in a little effort this week.  We appreciate it.  Still going to get you in white face.  All right, Earl.  But, yeah, we'll be here for a better time.  We'll be here until 4.30 and one thing that is cool is there are lots and lots of ladies  here.  All right.  Ah, there you go.  And those college ladies like to WOW, so college co has gone wild.  All right.  There's a lot of video cameras here.  There's Jersey West, you guys. 
[00:13:00]  Ah, cool.  So it's William Patterson University, Patterson, New Jersey, of course, the music festival with  Earl handing out the WOW stickers.  All right, Earl?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  He fell asleep.  Can I tell you something?  I'm an old radio salt.  Right.  I've been around.  I've worked at like eight radio stations, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Who keeps track, though?  Who has been worked at in the old days about rock radio?  When I listen to all the radio stations and they go to the street guy like he's at some 
[00:13:30]  kind of car fair or he's at...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  He's at some street festival.  I see where you're going here.  It's always so smooth.  Yeah.  You know?  And excitement.  Excitement.  It doesn't matter where he is.  Yeah.  Usually it goes like this.  We're coming in with Anthony.  He's at the Oyster Bay Festival this afternoon.  Anthony, what's going on there today?  Anthony, how you doing here at the Oyster Bay Festival?  I've got to tell you, we are having a blast.  And remember, this is sponsored by Acme Oysters, a great place to come to if you want to bring 
[00:14:00]  the family.  We're just having a great time.  I've eaten so many oysters today, I can't fit another one in me.  But we're having a lot of fun, so join us here at the Oyster Fest.  Back to you guys in the studio.  Thank you, Anthony.  We'll be checking in with him in another hour.  Oh, Jesus Christ, am I having a pisser?  This is great.  I'm not even done yet.  Yeah, they're full of energy.  They have what they want to say, all ready to go.  Yeah.  And Earl's just like, Earl!  Huh? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, we're on?  I got it.  We're at a sticker stop.  It's at Madison University.  Camera's here.  It's great.  Get a sticker.  He doesn't even say goodbye.  He doesn't wrap up his phone call.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  You want 15 stickers?  All right.  Chris, what's going on?  How you guys doing?  Great.  I'm a diehard Sox fan, and you guys are absolutely killing me today. 
[00:15:00]  Why?  Because I don't know whether to sit here and listen to you guys or drive down there and  bash your heads in with a baseball bat.  Chris, that's what makes it good.  We don't like when you guys agree with everything we do.  Just because Anthony's a Yankee fan, he's not looking for everyone else to be a Yankee fan.  That's what makes it fun.  Did you guys catch the special on Bill Buckner on Fox Sports Network this weekend?  Wasn't that the one Jay Moore narrated?  Yeah.  They interviewed him and his wife was saying how they got phone calls on whether he committed  suicide or not. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  But people wanted to kill him.  I heard he wanted to commit suicide, but he couldn't even do that right.  He missed his head.  You guys suck, man.  All right, Chris.  So there you have it.  Yes.  Whip them out Wednesday, even though it's crappy weather.  The ladies will take care of you guys today on the way home.  And some of the other ladies like to see flashing as well.  That's cool.  Okay.  You don't have the WOW bumper sticker.  We saw a lot today, didn't we, Anthony?  Yeah.  A hell of a lot of WOW stickers on the vehicles around Midtown Manhattan. 
[00:16:00]  But we also saw the homemade, you know, in the dirt written.  Yeah.  You know, the WOW written.  On the back of the truck.  And a few homemade signs.  We love seeing that as well.  So whatever it takes, guys and girls.  Yeah.  All right.  Get it on the vehicle.  And it also supports the shelf because we drive around and we're like, wow, cool.  That guy's a fan.  That guy's a listener.  It's cool.  Yeah.  It's really cool and we appreciate it.  Hell yeah.  So once again, self-addressed stamped envelope, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Now is Kimmy supposed to WOW us today?  This is what we're working up to with Kimmy. 
[00:16:30]  It's been, she's been on a few times.  She always says Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday.  Now it's Wednesday.  She's supposed to come in and we are supposed to see her WOW.  Wow.  She's all talk, no action, Anthony.  And I will, I will bet money that she'll have some type of excuse why she can't WOW  or she may even chicken out and not come here at all.  Jesus.  That's my humble opinion.  See, it would be great to just tease the fact that not only is she going to WOW us, 
[00:17:00]  that she is going to be in that whipped cream bikini bathing suit like she said she would do yesterday.  Right.  I don't even want to tease it because I don't believe it myself.  You don't believe it?  Don't believe it until I see it.  Yes, Rick?  What's up, Rick?  Um, ironically, I just got Kimmy on the phone line 12.  Oh.  Oh, here we go.  And she's listening.  Hi, Kimmy.  Hi, guys.  I'm heading in there.  You are?  Yes.  He's working on a school project.  Uh-huh.  And I'm the subject of his school project, so he's just going to film me in my whipped cream  bikini. 
[00:17:30]  You're actually going to put on a whipped cream bikini?  Why not?  Uh-huh.  Now, you know what that entails.  What?  It's just whipped cream.  I know it's just whipped cream.  Rick, turn up the camera.  I know.  There's a car with a WOW next to me.  Hey, WOW him.  He's got a blue van.  Is he listening?  Uh, what road are you guys...  Is it him?  What road?  Does he see me?  Hang on a second.  I'm going to go...  I want to go WOW.  He's getting a Kimmy WOW.  I gotta WOW this guy.  He's getting a celebrity WOW.  Hold on. 
[00:18:00]  Turn the radio.  Turn the radio down.  He doesn't see me.  Turn the radio down.  I am.  Hang on.  I'm in a car.  Someone else is driving.  All right.  All right.  Good.  Good way to WOW.  Okay.  Hang on.  You guys are going to hear me WOW.  Go ahead.  You got to beep the horn.  Beep the horn and get his attention.  Hang on a second.  All right.  WOW.  See, they don't even pay attention.  Oh, God.  This guy has no reason to...  I'm WOWing.  Woo.  There they are.  They sound in the blue man. 
[00:18:30]  We're on the radio right now and they don't even listen.  Is the guy very happy?  I think he's...  Him and his partner both happy.  Yes.  Hang on.  I'm going to give him an encore.  A celebrity WOWing.  There they are.  It's a WOWing.  They're listening.  Kimmy from Survivor WOWing.  I'm going to rock a...  Oh, I probably shouldn't even tell him what it is.  That's all right.  But I just wowed.  Is that good?  That's very good.  That's rules.  See?  Don't you want me to come in now and wow you?  Yes.  Come on in, Kimmy.  All right.  All right. 
[00:19:00]  I hear rumors that Jeff from Survivor will be here as well.  Good.  Well, because he's supposed to help me put on my bikini.  Oh, nice.  So what do I get to do in the bikini?  Nothing?  Just, yeah, kind of sit there and look really good.  Okay.  And you might actually win a trip to Hawaii.  Are they going to let me take a trip?  CBS, what, employees of CBS and blah, blah, blah.  I'm not an employee.  I'm a game show contestant.  Yeah, she's just a game show contestant.  I'm just a game show contestant.  You know what? 
[00:19:30]  I believe you're a contestant without a doubt.  Yeah.  When we get your pictures of your whipped cream bikini on WNEW.com in a couple hours,  the website's going to explode.  You think so?  I have, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Well, I brought in big heels, so it'll just be me and heels and a whipped cream bikini.  Get your ass in here.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  How was your special doctor yesterday?  Oh, God.  Not only was this a special doctor, but they have like one of those students that come with  you, please.  She was watching the chronic illnesses?  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Was it a guy?  No, it was a girl, and she just annoyed me.  Wow.  You know, because she's sitting there, and she's like going over everything.  I'm like, yes, this is what I do.  She's like, are you having sex with more than one person?  I'm like, oh, you know, sometimes.  Are you?  She just said sometimes.  Nice.  Nice.  Over the years.  Over the past.  You know, I've been with the same person for a while.  Yeah, for a couple of years.  But you know.  One person at a time?  No, not at a time.  Oh, at a time.  But she's like, what do you do to protect yourself? 
[00:20:30]  I said, condoms.  Just like everybody else.  She was not happy with that answer.  Why?  I don't know.  She's just like, oh, you think that's a good idea?  I was just like, and this is a student giving me the lecture.  What the hell are you supposed to do?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, you just can't give them the right answer.  I think if she's like one of those uptight married Christian people.  Screw it.  Screw the condoms, too.  They feel like crap.  Yeah.  Peel them off.  Yeah, well, you know.  Get back to effing skin to skin.  Exactly.  Make it feel good.  Enough's enough.  But I'm coming in, and it's Seventh Avenue and what? 
[00:21:00]  I know he's just there yesterday.  Fifty-seventh and seven.  You were just here.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm retarded.  All right.  I'll be there within an hour.  All right.  Great.  Can't wait to see you.  Okay.  Bye.  I heard AIDS was a rumor put out by the people that make Trojan condoms.  Is that true?  Yeah.  I heard a rumor like that.  Was I under, I was under my best behavior there.  No one noticed.  I know.  You didn't reen it.  I had so much I wanted to say.  I know, but don't reen it. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  So Kimmy's on her way.  A little canoodling maybe.  Yes.  Canoodling.  It's the whipped cream bikini contest.  Grand prize trip to Hawaii.  No ladies showed up yesterday.  Completely disappointed the radio program.  Yeah.  Hopefully we'll have more than just Kimmy coming down today.  Not that Kimmy's just, but I mean, we would like to see some more ladies showing up for  the contest, okay?  And also today, what about Rodney?  Rodney Dangerfield at five o'clock.  Five o'clock in studio.  You know, we're going to have to save some of the festivities for Rodney.

You get to see Rodney and you get to see Kimmy from Survivor and Jeff from Survivor.  What's Jeff's last name?  Werner, Varner.  Varner.  Something like that.  Yeah.  From Survivor.  From Survivor.

[00:23:00]  What's wrong, Fez?  Why am I so different from the boys at school?  None of the other kids in gym class have back hair.  I wouldn't worry about that, Fez.  You wouldn't?  No, I'd worry about being arrested for hanging out around the boys' gym class.  I never thought of it like that, Ron.  Thanks.  All on the next, Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027-WNEW.  Hold on.  We're talking to some girl from Vegas.  Laura.  No, I'm not in Vegas.  Now I'm home. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  But you saw what in Vegas?  I...  Yesterday.  This is Keith's mom.  Oh, what's going on?  Nothing.  All right.  Sorry.  We just threw you on the air real fast, because we were in the middle of commercials anyway.  Oh, okay.  Um...  I was coming in from the pool yesterday, because I was watching Survival with my mother, trying  to turn her on to the show.  So yesterday, though, I was coming in, and a commercial was on.  It was the Survival logo, and then Kimmy was on, and they were talking something that  she's, like, um, you know, getting a lot of, um... 
[00:24:00]  Recognition?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Come on, Laura.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  And the 102.7, uh, microphone and stuff.  Oh, my God.  So it was the...  Okay.  It was the CBS film crew when they were filming Kimmy on our show, and they made some kind  of, uh, commercial or piece, or what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Commercial.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, you can hang on her.  I've got a copy of her in the office. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  What...  Holy mother of God.  They sent it over this morning before you guys got here.  We took a quick look at it.  It's a cool piece.  It's, like, about a minute and a half on Kimmy.  Shows her in the studio.  Shows you guys talking to her.  Has the, uh, you know, station featured in it.  And where is it airing?  Uh, it's airing.  It's a CBS thing they're doing.  All over the country?  Yes.  Because the floor saw it in Vegas.  Yeah.  And it's all over.  Is Aunt and I talking?  I wasn't in Vegas.  I was watching the TV show Vegas with Robert Urich.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  He was ponderous.  That's Keith's mom, though.  I know.  And she's always been that way.  Keith's mom has given us some good radio. 
[00:25:00]  Not...  Just not today, I guess.  Now, is this gonna...  Is it a commercial or is it gonna be part of, like...  It's like a feature piece.  But who's running it?  Uh, CBS.  Like their news program or something?  Yeah.  Okay, gotcha.  Because, uh, I guess they're focusing in on her 15 minutes, so...  Rick, hey...  No, that's the way they put it in the piece.  Oh, yes.  They're saying all the survivor guys...  Okay, listen.  If you blow this...  I'm just...  If anyone blows this...  Listen, listen.  I'm even smart enough to shut my effin' trap.  And he's an idiot when it comes to this stuff.  Yeah, I'll be the first to admit that. 
[00:25:30]  You always read it.  I ruin a lot of things.  Listen, don't even mention her name until she gets here.  Mm-hmm.  Because we're idiots.  We're gonna wreck it.  Exactly.  Not every day we get, like, someone famous in a whipped cream bikini.  What are they saying?  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Quiet.  I didn't say anything. 
[00:26:00]  I'm just gonna act like that retarded kid in school when he doesn't want to hear anything.  No!  No!  You did that so well.  Alright, Anthony, pinnacle horny goey.  Quiet.  Exactly.

No more excuses.  Don't use the job as an excuse.  You're stressed out so you can't have sex.  You got kids so you can't have sex.  Obviously, that's not a problem with Keith's mom.  Do you remember poor Keith walking in and seeing his dad yam bag deep?  Jesus!  Yeah, but what was the line the little kid had about them fighting over a milk dud? 
[00:27:30]  It looked like two pigs fighting over a milk dud when he walked in on his parents having sex.  That's good.  You can't write stuff like that.

You get a cool hook and then back to the stupid radio show.  Chuck, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I just want to register a complaint, I guess.  I don't know whether it's with you or with Black Girl.  I mean, you know, you announced that you're having a sticker shop stop at William Patterson University, 
[00:30:30]  but I don't know what the hell that is.  I've never heard of it.  It's the university.  Hi, it's Earl.  I'm here.  Exactly.  What town?  What state?  Earl.  People really don't know where you are.  I say we're at the student center at William Patterson University in beautiful Wayne, New Jersey.  Wayne, New Jersey.  Okay.  What about a street address?  Can we have that?  It's the campus.  I don't know exactly where we are. 
[00:31:00]  Is someone supposed to drive around Wayne looking for college students?  Wayne?  What?  One of the signs that say William Patterson.  It's right off of Route 23.  No, no.  Wait, wait.  All right, Earl.  Route 23.  Thanks, Earl.  Jesus Christ.  He's really mad and quit again this week.  Let him quit.  He just hung up.  He just hung up.  Hey, look.  What the hell?  That was the first time he mentioned a street.  Exactly.  And he sounded pissed off.  No, Chuck's making a good point here.  Thank you.  It's always fun to abuse Earl and stuff, but he's at the student center.  Where's the student center? 
[00:31:30]  I don't know where the student center is.  Right.  By the time I get there and find it, it'll be five o'clock, he'll be gone.  Is it near the Ratskeller?  Five o'clock, he'll be gone.  It'll be four o'clock.  No, he leaves at four.  All right.  Earl's back.  Earl.  Earl.  Yes.  Don't get pissed because no one knows where the student center is.  It's the first exit off of, I'll give you, it's right off of Ratsa Road.  Ratsa Road.  Okay, good.  It becomes Pompton Road.  Okay, good.  You will see these big, giant, black signs that say, William Patterson. 
[00:32:00]  Dude, listen, listen the way he sounds.  It's all condescending.  Look, you didn't even just say what's wrong.  I'm going to say this sounds a freaking retard.  Oh, retard, right.  Okay, Earl.  William Patterson.  So no one gets mixed up, okay?  All right, Earl.  Now sit and listen to me, whoever this guy is on the phone.  I'm listening.  Go ahead.  Once you pass the intersection of Ratsa Road and Hamburg Turnpike.  Okay.  It becomes Pompton Road. 
[00:32:30]  Pompton Road.  You go up about 200 yards.  200 yards.  There's the first entrance.  First entrance.  You'll hang there left.  Yes.  And proceed there.  And you'll see the parade of drunken college students.  All right, at 4.30, Earl, we'll be there until.  All right.  Now, Earl, would it have killed you instead of the first time you talked to them what city  you were in or what city you were in?  I apologize because we have a bad cell phone here.  A bad cell phone?  Cut the crap, Earl.  You don't know what city you were in.  I don't know what city you were in. 
[00:33:00]  You know, you could drop the easy way and just send in a freaking self-addressed stamped  envelope.  Oh.  That means that you can't write and use your brain a little bit.  I want to see a guy dressed all in black, huh?  What about that?  Well, go to Harlem.  Oh, go to Harlem.  Earl, this is supposed to support the show, Earl.  This is for all the people.  Come on.  I don't know if you're supporting yourself, but I'm doing good to do business.  No offense.  I think it just...  Earl, did you just curse?  No.  I think Earl just cursed. 
[00:33:30]  Did he?  But ask you.  All right, Earl.  Ask me, Earl.  Try to support the damn show.  All right.  I am trying to support the show.  That's what I'm doing.  All right.  We found out what city he's in.  That's good.  Well, that's a star.  Wayne, New Jersey.  That's good.  Jesus Christ.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Let's not get ahead.  Thanks, Earl.  I'm here, people.  What?  Earl?  He's gone.  Thank you, Chuck.  Oh, thank you, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Chuck, very funny today.  Going back to listening to the stations on the weekends when they do their little sales 
[00:34:00]  remotes and stuff.  Oh, they tell you exactly where it is.  That guy always sounds chipper and happy on the other end of the phone when they go to  that car dealership or something.  You don't hear this.  We're here at the...  No, I'll set you up.  I'll set you up.  I'll set you up.  Hey, Anthony, you're live at Huntington Honda.  That's right, Elpy.  We're here at Huntington Honda, located on Jericho Turnpike at Route 110. 
[00:34:30]  That's it.  That's all you gotta do.  You give exactly where you are.  Right there.  But this is what we get.  Now, do the same thing as Earl.  Earl, you're at Huntington Honda.  What's going on today?  I see motorcycles.  We're doing a sticker stunt.  Come get your sticker at the motorcycle place.  It's not even a bit.  This happens every week.  Every week.  Every week.  Actually, I'm across the street from the motorcycle place.  I couldn't find a place to park.  It was parallel parking only.  And you know how horrendous I am in parallel parking.  Uh-oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here comes, Earl's calling back.  It's always fun when you quit. 
[00:35:00]  Ah, God dammit.  He hung up.  Earl?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl quits.  Earl quits.  Every week.  Real quick for every week.  Um, well, it's not even a bit.  It's not even a bit.  This happens every week.  Every week.  Actually, I'm across the street from the motorcycle place.  I couldn't find a place to park.  It was parallel parking only.  And you know how horrendous I am at parallel parking?  Uh-oh.  Earl quits every week.  He quits at every sticker stop he does.  He ends up quitting until the next sticker stop.  The over-under is that Earl calls before 4.05 and quits. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  Why would you go home like that, man?  Justin.  Justin.  Hello.  Let's go.  Yo.  What's up?  Yo, I was the guy in the blue van that got wowed by Kimmy.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  How were the boobs?  Oh, man, they were beautiful.  Nice.  You saw Kimmy's boobs before we did.  Absolutely beautiful.  You've got to get her to take them out, man.  Well, we're going to get her in a whipped cream bikini in a little while.  Oh, that's great.  I'll be listening.  Blue Rock Hotel, man.  She whipped them right out.  Right on, Justin.  That's good for you. 
[00:36:00]  So now, Justin.  Yeah.  Now, when you saw them, were you like, oh, my God, I'm being wowed?  Well, the first, she just whipped out one, and I was like, what the hell?  You know, what's going on?  And then I turned on the radio station because she was saying that she was on the phone,  so I turned it on, and I was listening, and I looked over, and then she whipped them  both out.  Nice.  And they were just beautiful, man.  Nice.  Absolutely beautiful.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks.  Thanks, Justin.  Look, his friends all excited got on the radio.  Uh-oh.  Stinky, you got an update?  Earl called Jesse and said, tell them they could easily get another guy, and then hung 
[00:36:30]  up.  Does that mean he quit?  No.  That's how it always happens.  It's just a building process.  He threatens to quit, and then he finally quits like 15, 20 minutes later.  Because this is hysterical.  It happens every time.  And people think it's a bid.  It's not a bid.  No.  He does this every sticker stop.  He quits.  And then he's back again.  Because he threatens with, you know, telling them they could find another guy, hoping we'll  call him and go, oh, please, Earl, please don't quit.  Don't quit.  We need you. 
[00:37:00]  You're an important part of the team.  Guys?  Hello?  Yeah, Earl?  Hi.  Sticker stop.  Today, we're here on planet Earth.  I'm kind of near a big body of water.  Tim, what's up?  Guys, you've got to take it easy on Earl.  You know, it's a school, and he's not used to the edumacational calls.  Oh, stop it.  Come on, Tim.  So he, you know, he ain't be schooled in that homie stuff with distributed. 
[00:37:30]  All right, Tim.  So he can be a complete idiot without having to bring race into it.  Yes, I apologize for Tim there, Earl, if you're listening.  Afni.  Yo.  That's your name, huh?  Afni.  It's pretty effed up, I know.  What nationality is that?  That's Albanian.  Wow.  Rock.  Yeah, right.  All right, what's going on?  Nothing, man.  I wanted to, you guys have been teasing us.  I wanted to hear that, your brother Joe song, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah, we got it.  Come on, man.  All right, we'll do it right now.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Take care. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, you want to explain the whole Hayseed Dixie thing?  Yeah, well, we were playing that last week, Hayseed Dixie Dixie.  Dixie, whatever.  It's, yeah, country versions of ACDC songs.  It was kind of cool.  And my brother Joe was inspired by it and decided to do a country version of Stephen Lynch's song,  Special Olympics.  Can we play the new version of Special Olympics just to set this up?  He says it's Tennessee Stephen Lynchburg. 
[00:38:30]  That's what he's calling himself during this tune.  All right.  We're going to play the original Stephen Lynch, and then we're going to play Brother Joe's country version.  All right.  Brother Joe jumping on the country bandwagon, Anthony.  Why not?  Oh, for God's sake, we know what the hell.  You know, just say it.  We know what Jeffrey Ross has been up to a couple of days in a row.  Fine.  What does anyone want? 
[00:39:00]  They're like, oh, pussies, you're not talking about.  He's his own guy.  He can do whatever the hell he wants.  Jeffrey called us and told us what he was doing.  What's the big deal?  Who cares?  What, are we going to play those games?  That's it.  Oh.  I don't care what he does.  He's his own guy.  Jeffrey's a very cool guy.  Very funny guy.  Fine.  Does some great radio for our show.  And he did a cool thing by calling us and telling us what he was up to.  Oh, my God.  Where's the exclusivity contract he signed to only appear on the Opie and Anthony show?  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[00:39:30]  We don't play those games.  We're not paranoid.  No.  We're totally fine with it.  More power to them.  But the second someone appears on this goddamn show, we, you know, that's when the trouble starts.  And that's when the words get thrown back and forth.  We don't care.  Have fun.  All right.  With that, Anthony.  Yes.  Back to the entertainment.  Stephen Lynch.  Here's the Special Olympics song.  Updated.  He added a verse.  And then we'll play Brother Joe next.  Watch them run.

[00:48:30]  Who's that?  Who's that just using me?  Who's that really hot girl?  I don't know.  Please.  Hey, actually, I have some information on that.  Yeah, go ahead, Devin.  All right.  Well, yesterday, because I am the incredible winner that I am, my brother and I, stumbled into  Hooters.  And passed the word along about the whipped cream bikini contest.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, I can't guarantee anything, but we have someone who is very interested and said that  she would come to the station to participate in the whipped cream bikini contest. 
[00:49:00]  Well, Devin, let me tell you something.  A 10 just showed up.  Right, Kim?  A 10.  We don't know her name yet.  She's a 10.  She's a 10.  She got Pete, our engineer, to disconnect the root that holds him into a seat, and he got  up and checked her out.  A really, really, really hot girl just showed up for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Oh, excellent.  Well, my...  Contest is on.  If it's Elizabeth, then she's the one from, who said that she might show up.  And if she does show up... 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I have to tell you, gentlemen, it's going to be team whipped cream bikini contest.  Oh, nice.  All right, listen.  We got something for you today.  This is, of course, his buzz from Home Alone.  Yeah.  Devin is his real name.  Devin, check this out.  Order the string!  Order the string!  Order the string!  Order the string!  I love it.  Order the string!  I found that sample yesterday.  I found it when I went home and dug it out and found it. 
[00:50:00]  The brilliant Martin Landau playing Bela Nugosi, yes.  So, are you coming down today or what?  Yeah, I'm in the neighborhood.  I just went to go see K-Rock.  You know, I was hanging out with them for a while.  That's smart.  Hey, you're funny, Devin.  Come on by.  All right.  We're setting up some type of tap.  Some type of what?  Some type of Jägermeister tap.  It's one of those chilling things that bring it down to like five degrees. 
[00:50:30]  I don't understand what this is.  Daddy doesn't feel too good after last night.  I don't know what this place is turning into.  It's like a bar.  I can buy hash in the corner if I want it.  I'm going to have to tip you guys?  Yeah, just tip your waitstaff.  Yeah, come on down.  It's going to be fun.  And Rodney Dangerfield is coming by in about an hour or two.  Excellent.  Hey, I'm going to come up.  All right.  Cool, man.  Cool.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There he goes, Devin.  Newest pal of the show.  Boy, just sing.  Boy, just sing.  Buzz from Home Alone. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny.  Danny, you're next on NEW.  What's up?  Hello.  What's up?  Hey, man.  What's up?  I saw Andrew Dice Clay in the Sun Island Advance today.  I even had a picture in there, too, and said he's reinvented himself in this new  movie with Liv Tyler.  Yeah.  What's that movie?  A Night at McCool's or whatever it's called?  Yeah, there you go.  The movie's getting really good reviews, and he's getting really good reviews.  He's got a small role in the movie, and he didn't want to tell us what he's doing because  he doesn't want to wreck it for him.  I'm not, because that's Andrew Silverstein. 
[00:51:30]  See, I didn't use the Dice name.  I'm the Silverstein.  I'm the real man.  Yeah, I can't use the Dice name for the movies because I don't want to taint it with the  obnoxious bastard that everyone knows DICE is.  You hear my line?  I say, how you take it?  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You guys are tools.  All right.  Cool.  Can I say one quick thing?  Yeah.  Scott Matiga, you're at Tools.  Thanks a lot.  Hey, look at that.  All right.  Bye.  One more shout-out.  One person and his friends care. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  Yeah, Dice looks totally different in this, I hear, and he's Andrew Silverstein.  Almost unrecognizable, he says.  Was he skinny?  No, he was funny.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow.  But you know something?  We love the guy.  Yeah.  But we love the guy.  One of our favorite guests, of course.  That's how it works.  Yeah, we learned that from the comedians.  Yeah.  Because we love surrounding ourselves with comedians.  Yes.  It's what we do.  We love that stuff. 
[00:52:30]  Absolutely.  We've been doing it for quite a while.  At least six or seven years.  It's what we do.  Yeah, you don't have to work this hard.  Since we can't get the A guests.  Anthony, you have a comment about Jack.  I'm pissed off.  You know, walking into the studio before to start the show, I was leaving the office,  and there's CNN's cross-eyed Bobby Batista with that new show she does, talking about those  kids that videotape themselves, one of them getting hit by a car. 
[00:53:00]  So I'm like, she's, they're all blaming Jackass.  There you go.  The Jackass music.  Where is it?  Kicking in.  Everyone's blaming Jackass for children's stupidity.  What a great clip, though. 
[00:53:30]  That kid flies over the top of this talk.  What these kids did, three kids, they have video cameras inside a car and outside on the street.  Guy stands in the middle of the road.  I didn't know this had words.  Sure.  He's mad and fired me.  Okay.  Okay.  All right, all right, all right.  So, yeah, the kid's standing in the middle of the road.  Car goes speeding down the road.  It looks like this kid might have been trying to attempt the jump over the car gag a la Jackie Chan or something, you know? 
[00:54:00]  Where they usually use a Ferrari or something that's like six inches off the ground.  Ain't going about 100 miles an hour.  Yeah.  So it can go under you when you're up in the air for that split second.  And you jump up.  Exactly.  They're using, I don't even know what they're using, a Subaru or something?  Yeah, someone will correct me.  A Honda Civic.  There you go, a Honda Civic.  And they speed up.  The kid just gets slammed by this car.  Flies off the hood.  It looks great. 
[00:54:30]  I mean, it really looks good.  The kid contours to the roof of the car.  And then gets tossed like 20 feet in the air.  Spins around a few times, lands on his head.  Spins around.  The dopey kid didn't know how to use the camera.  Because he couldn't even keep the kid in frame.  We never saw him hit.  But he effed himself up pretty good.  A lot of injuries.  And now here comes another outpouring, blaming jackass.  There's not enough disclaimers on the show.  They disclaim before every segment now.  Everything.  And if something they think a kid might try, they do disclaimers during the stunt. 
[00:55:00]  Can't these kids read?  They staple the disclaimers to Steve-O.  To Steve-O's bare butt.  So this guy now in the post, this Adam Buckman guy, all of a sudden is blaming Johnny Knoxville and his show Jackass.  Doesn't he say, how many people are going to get hurt because of you, Johnny?  Yes, people are going to get hurt because of this car incident.  And that's not the only thing. 
[00:55:30]  Of course, children have been setting themselves on fire, which I don't get.  If you saw the Jackass bit where these kids say they're imitating Jackass and pouring gas on themselves and setting themselves on fire, that wasn't the bit.  Johnny Knoxville, what, he put some meat on himself and threw himself on a barbecue.  Well, he also had the flamethrower thing.  What was he wearing for that?  Near the pool when he was on crutches.  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember.  I guess they just put, yeah, they just set him on fire.  Did they set him on fire?  Hey, cool.  He had a flame retardant.  Flame retardant thing on and stuff. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, he just wanted to be on fire for a little while.  Great.  Great.  It's called sending the herd.  If your kid is this stupid.  Exactly.  Whatever.  You know, why are you doing it?  And more parking spaces for me.  Right.  And this douchebag, Adam Buckman from the Post, is saying Johnny Knoxville thinks stunts like pepper spray in the face are funny.  Wrong.  Try dumb and dangerous, Johnny.  Now, don't speak for me, Adam. 
[00:56:30]  The guy doesn't think it's funny.  Say, in my opinion, I don't find it funny.  But I think it's hysterical.  I think most of the stuff on that show is hilarious.  I like it.  I think it's funny watching these guys just beat the crap out of themselves and you're wondering when they're going to be dead.  That's fine.  If kids start doing it, it's not the show's fault.  Your kid's a retard.  Who's going to stand in front of a speeding car?  Your kid's a retard.  Remember those kids that were laying down in the middle of the street when that football movie came out? 
[00:57:00]  And they got run over by cars?  Retards!  Oh, well.  Your kid's brain damage.  Sucks to be you that you're so stupid.  Right.  And they would go, oh, let's take the scene out of the movie.  What?  Because your child's a dumbass and lays down in the road because it was in a movie?  Please.  I don't even think they did the car stunt on Jackass, did they?  I don't know.  Sometimes you see the clips of them running into the side of a car when it's slowly moving in a parking lot. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  They might have done it.  Bill, what's going on?  First off, good for that kid.  He deserves everything he gets.  He gave us some great television today.  I watched that clip almost as many times as I watched the one landing gear plane land on the runway.  I don't know which clip was better.  Hold on, hold on.  The clip Anthony's talking about, the Jackass clip where the kid gets nailed by the car,  it's on foundrymusic.com if you haven't seen it on TV yet.  Oh, my God.  I did this just in.  A 767 pilot saw the clip of the private plane landing with one landing gear. 
[00:58:00]  He tried it himself and killed a whole plane load of people.  Yo, did you guys see Sundays?  Blame the news.  I don't miss Jackass.  One of the best shows on TV.  Definitely.  And you know what?  I thought the last couple might have gotten a little stale.  This one was just unbelievable with the jellyfish.  Oh, the jellyfish yarmulke?  I couldn't control myself, bro.  Did you see that with Steve-O?  Yeah, Steve-O put his face in a tank of jellyfish.  Steve-O is my new favorite Jackass.  He's my hero.  Yeah, I mean, he's got to get rid of the ball bag thing. 
[00:58:30]  That's a little weird.  Yeah, that is very weird.  I don't know many guys that would hang around their friends in a ball bag like Steve-O likes  to do, but whatever.  He's into that.  That's fine.  Dude, come on.  I used to like Bam.  Bam, yeah.  But now Steve-O is my favorite.  Bam's still good.  Bam is good.  He still does some sick crap.  And who's the guy that beats the crap out of his dad?  Bam.  That's Bam.  Yeah, Bam.  Yeah, when he milked it, too, and would pour the urine over his head at the end, too,  and make himself puke.  They love puking on that show. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, he takes his art form to a new level by doing that.  Right on.  But, yeah, we love the Jackass.  It's great entertainment.  Yeah, they're going to ruin it for everybody.  Of course.  People in the media.  And, you know, MTV is going to fold.  Well, you know, I would love to trash MTV, but I have to give them props.  I thought they were going to fold by now.  Oh, yeah.  They will.  They'll probably have to fold eventually, but, you know, I thought they would do it months ago.  Yo, I hope they put it on DVD.  They should do something.  All right, Bill, thank you.  Thanks, later.  There are so many disclaimers.  Don't do this. 
[00:59:30]  Don't make a tape of anything.  Don't send tapes in.  We will never even open them.  Don't do this.  And what responsibility does MTV or Jackass have when your child is an idiot?  This is another story.  A 12-year-old boy imitating a son on Jackass, despite numerous warnings.  His parents didn't know the show existed, didn't know the son was watching it.  You've got to know what you...  Didn't know he was imitating a stunt scene.  And they're now suing the show and demanding it be taken off of MTV.  You know, it might give you some kind of, I don't know, a peace of mind if you go to court and sue and try to get it taken off the air. 
[01:00:00]  And it might put out of your mind that your 12-year-old is retarded.  That he's retarded.  You know who has a really good take on this?  Oh.  You're going to laugh, but Mick Foley, Mankind, from the WWF.  Mankind, great.  I got it.  No.  He's pretty much physically damaged.  Yeah, but he's in the middle of this because, you know, he gets blamed for a lot of stuff because people are imitating the wrestling moves and doing the backyard wrestling.  I'm reading his book that's coming out in May, his second book, first week of May, and I think he's going to be on our show. 
[01:00:30]  We've got to talk to him.  Does it come with crayons for the coloring book?  You know, surprisingly, he's a really good writer.  Yeah.  And very, very smart guy.  He's smart.  He's funny.  You know.  As a goof, I picked up his first book when I went on vacation.  Yeah.  Just as a goof.  I'm like, you know, mine was fun.  I'll read it.  And it was really, really good.  And now he's got this second book coming out.  But he talks about, you know, how frustrated he is that, you know, WWF gets blamed for kids trying the moves and stuff. 
[01:01:00]  And then he brings up a lot of examples.  I'm just going to give you the basics here.  But he goes, how many kids are hurt just playing football?  But that's okay.  Yeah.  Like crippled and, yeah, playing football.  But you don't see an outcry to stop football or take football off TV or stop football from schools.  Because I guess that's, see, that's an acceptable form of child injury.  Right.  It's acceptable.  That's an acceptable way to injure children is through football. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  Which is fine by me.  That's just the basics.  I mean, he writes a whole chapter on it.  It's pretty interesting.  And hopefully he'll talk about it when he's on our show.  But it's like, yeah, there's other sports out there that the kids are imitating and getting.  And he said that there's so many more football injuries than every year.  Paralyzed, broken bones at least.  And he goes, it's not even close between, you know, kids that are stupid enough to try these wrestling moves,  even though they're not experienced enough to do it.  It doesn't even compare to the amount of kids getting paralyzed every year from football injuries. 
[01:02:00]  So why is that an acceptable way to injure children?  And what's the difference between that and a kid trying to jump over a car?  Because the car stunt is stupid and football is cool?  Like, what's the difference?  Right.  There's so much more to it, but that's just touching the surface.  Great point.  Maybe we could have a discussion on that when it comes in.  Yeah, but just on Jackass, a couple weeks ago, they had him catching a football and getting, you know, slammed by all the elbows.  Yeah, creamed.  Right.  So, I mean, it's right there.  He's doing the exact same thing they'd like you to do.  Yep. 
[01:02:30]  Steve says he doesn't like when we thin the herd.  Steve.  Guys, what's up?  Hey.  You know, Ann, I think you're being a little short-sighted here.  We don't want to thin the herd because these morons will be providing us entertainment for years and years to come.  Steve?  Steve, it doesn't matter how much of the herd is thin.  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with their stupidity.  Yeah.  Hey, 20 years from now, his great-grandchildren, God knows what they'll be up to.  You're never going to sit there and go, you know, there just aren't any a-holes left on the planet. 
[01:03:00]  That's true.  There will always be jerks, retarded children, parents who want to sue because their children are stupid.  All right, yeah.  Steve, I've got to move on because someone else has a really good point I want to get to, okay?  All right.  Because it's always something.  Like when we were growing up, Anthony?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Say what you want to say.  Hey, back in the days, who sued Evel Knievel when he jumped over all of these damn cars and every other kid tried to imitate him?  You know what? I was stupid enough to try jumping over garbage cans.  Who didn't?  Our own Rick.  What'd you break, your collarbone?  I broke my collarbone. 
[01:03:30]  I busted my teeth.  Imitating Evel Knievel.  A retard.  Nice.  Thanks.  You know, I don't know whether I'm a good parent or not, but I'll check.  Joey Paisano stitches from Imitating Evel Knievel?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's like eight or 16 stitches right on my chin.  That's part of growing up.  Part of you has to be sick.  I'm telling you.  I know something.  Me, myself.  Well, quickly.  Anthony, hold on two seconds.  Quickly, myself.  Three broken bones, 27 stitches, imitating Evel Knievel.  Nice. 
[01:04:00]  On my chick.  I was beating her.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Anthony, I'm sorry.  I had a stupid joke.  I mean, I did all that stuff on a regular bicycle.  Then I got a motorcycle.  Oh, that's always fun.  The mini bike, which is really designed.  The 70s mini bike for jumping over stuff.  Like a paperweight with wheels.  It's a freaking steel frame with a lawnmower engine on it.  And you got the short, fat wheels that everybody thinks they can jump stuff on, on this 300-pound 
[01:04:30]  piece of metal.  My brother, my brother Joe wanted a mini bike so bad when he was, I don't know, 13, maybe,  14.  And my mother dead set against it.  He's just crying the whole time.  Give me a mini.  I want a mini bike.  I want to get one.  I got some money.  It's my own money.  I want to do this.  My father finally goes, all right, get a mini bike.  And then my mother's like, if anything happens to you, blah, blah, blah.  Like, the first day he's riding this thing, he goes to do some stunt, barrels headlong  into a tree, and just bends the forks back, the bike, unrideable after that. 
[01:05:00]  And, of course, never told my mom.  Didn't want that.  I told you, though.  You'll shoot your eye out, kid.  Very quickly.  All right, Anthony.  Good job.  All right.  But back on Jack, I'm telling you, I watched that show with my son.  And, you know, you've got to tell him, it's only a show.  There you go.  I mean, really.  I mean, Anthony, too.  Look at the Sopranos.  What are they promoting?  I mean, my biggest hero is this guy who goes down and kills people. 
[01:05:30]  You know, I love it.  It's a joke.  If they want to keep TV good today, they've got to make it real.  End of story.  A lot of parents, you know, have the TV babysit for their kids.  You've got to, like, know what your kids are up to to a certain point.  I'm telling you, I'm in the industry.  When somebody's TV's not working, the biggest thing is Nickelodeon's not on.  Why?  Because that's all my kid watches.  All right.  He's going to be a retard.  End of story.  All right.  He's going to be a retard.  There you go.  Thank you.  Later.  We'll get into it a lot more when McFoley comes in, because he has some interesting things 
[01:06:00]  to say.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  I hung out with Steve-O down in Panama City a couple weeks ago.  He had a lot of nice stuff to say about the show.  Are you serious?  I swear on my mother's grave.  Well, we would love Steve-O from Jackass on our show, without a doubt.  We know the best.  The guy's hilarious.  We don't do it.  We don't do it yet.  Go ahead.  A lot of people talking over us today for some reason.  Can you hear us?  Yes, I can hear you.  I apologize.  Maybe the volume in the...  No, I'm not even trying to be a dick, because a lot of people are doing it.  I can't hear you. 
[01:06:30]  Because sometimes people mess with the knobs, and the voice is a little lower in the headset  or something.  Jay?  Yes?  No, what I was going to say is we would love Steve-O on our show.  We don't need Johnny Knoxville.  We would settle for Steve-O.  Sure.  He's awesome.  Seriously, he's crazy.  He's on the show.  He's just this crazy person.  He said, because I told him about you guys, and I was like, you know, they talk about Jackass  a lot, and it's a huge market, and he's like, is that something like with the girls show  there, you know?  I said, yeah, man.  I said, how'd you know about that?  And he said he was up in New York not too long ago, and he saw people doing it or heard 
[01:07:00]  about it or something.  Well, someone get Steve-O on our show.  All right.  Please.  All right.  You guys are the best.  Thanks, Jay.  Later.  All right.  We've got to move on.  There's a girl here for the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest, right?  Ah.  Dude.  Raves outside.  Raves.  Did she, um...  Jake, how hot is she?  Did she already take her pants?  The penthouse playmate thing came in the other day, almost.  Get out of here.  Yeah, this girl's smoking.  And where's Kimmy?  She's...  Dude, come on.  It's Kimmy.  No, I just mean that she's coming from Long Island. 
[01:07:30]  All right, all right.  Very good.  She's probably stuck in traffic.  Going off.  Right?  Stuck in traffic.  Thank you, Rick.  Brother Joe.  Never mind the Heathcote minibike incident.  What was better was going down off the side of the parkway, I set up a ramp with the...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  With a knock hockey table.  Knock hockey.  Yeah.  Back then, you're not much of the engineer, you know?  Yeah, Joe didn't understand physics and engineering and forward momentum and weight and... 
[01:08:00]  But I was like...  I was the king of the bicycle jumpers.  I used to take like six, seven garbage cans...  Yeah, the garbage cans is what you jumped.  Yeah.  The tall...  You know, standing them up.  Yeah.  And I put...  The trajectory wasn't quite right.  It was a little high.  And you know the side of a parkway, it's all like the grass that goes really steep down  a hill.  Yeah.  All right.  And I started at the top, up by the road, and headed down towards the woods. 
[01:08:30]  There was a clearing right before the woods.  And as soon as the ground leveled out, I would say maybe about 25 feet into that, I had this  knock hockey table set up at like, let's say, it was nearly 90 degrees.  I remember.  Because the Evel Knievel's ramp was always very steep.  Well, the one for the Snake River jump was too steep.  I needed some height.  Oh, but I needed height.  Yeah, okay.  I think I was trying to clear like eight garbage cans.  It was a new record.  And it was up on like cinder blocks or something? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what happened after that, Ant?  You witnessed this one.  He hits the thing full speed.  I mean, tooling.  And the knock hockey table splits right in two.  He goes full speed into a pile of cinder blocks.  Okay, Doc, that's pretty good.  I'll jump into a glass of water on my head.  Yeah, I had all these heels.  I ended up leaving the bicycle seat and flew through the air, did a complete flip, and 
[01:09:30]  landed flat on my stomach.  You know, Joe, you weren't imitating Evel Knievel.  You were imitating Fonzie.  Absolutely.  When he crashed into the chicken stand in front of Arnold.  In front of Arnold.  All right, man.  Good job on that country version of the last thing.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thanks.  Take it easy.  All right, look.  We've got to take a break.  Kimmy has arrived.  Another girl has arrived that's like a 10 that's getting her pictures done for the whipped cream  bikini contest.  Rodney Dangerfield on the way.  They're setting up some kind of...  They're already using it. 
[01:10:00]  They're using it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They're already using it.  Oh, Jesus.  We've got the Jaeger machine is here.  The Jaeger machine.  Brian from Jaeger...  Well, I don't know if he's from...  Oh.  All right, get it over with.  Get it over with.  Let's see it.  Come here.  Watch out, Joey.  Not through the glass.  No, no.  No prison visit.  No prison visit.  There's no sign?  All right, here.  Oh, my God.  Kimmy is going to wow us.  We've been waiting for this for about a month.  I have no sign?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, my God.  You're a guy.  Ta-da!  Yeah!  There you go.  I put Justin in the van.  Bravo!  Bravo!  Bravo!  Kimmy wowed us.  I told you.  Our first celebrity wow.  You're a first for everything.  Wow, look at this.  People still clapping.  Good-looking girl in there.  The standing ovation.  People not stopping.  Oh, my God.  I think they want an encore.  Oh, my God. 
[01:11:00]  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  When the whip tube falls off.  All right, that's good enough.  Rick, shut the F off.  Quiet.  He's going to ruin it for everyone.  He's going to mean it.  Quiet.  All right.  When will you be doing the whipped cream bikini?  Um, I think I'll wait until Jeff comes in.  That way he can help me apply the whipped cream.  Oh, yeah.  Jeff from Survivor coming in, too.  Cool.  There you go.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Rodney Dangerfield on the way. 
[01:11:30]  This is Brian, the guy who brought the Jaeger stuff.  How you guys doing?  What's up, Brian?  You've got to get us in trouble, man.  It's all right.  It's cool, man.  We're a big supporter of the Jaeger Meister, so we brought you down the tap machine.  Right.  Chelsea Jaeger at about five degrees.  And I keep it cold forever.  And we brought you down some other Jaeger goodies.  Wouldn't five degrees be ice?  A pool stick?  No, because we have all of them.  You know, I'm a bartender.  I've served Jaeger many, many times.  Look at that.  Oh.  Grey Goose.  We love the Grey Goose.  The ice cream PD's favorite vodka. 
[01:12:00]  We also import Grey Goose.  Grey Goose rocks.  We'll give that a shot for a happy hour.  Right on.  Cool.  I want to thank you guys for your support.  Did you watch, did you see that movie Home Alone?  I did.  Buzz.  He's on, man.  He's laughing.  You know, we're dead serious.  I'll get an autograph later.  Yeah.  I can't believe I missed it.  I missed the Wow.  I walked in right after.  Macaulay's older brother in Home Alone.  I missed the Wow before, so I didn't believe it.  All right, Kimmy.  One more time.  Yeah, one more time before the whipped cream. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Oh, look.  Oh, yeah.  He's got the phone.  Devin's holding the sign up now.  You got to hold it up, right?  Kimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that rocks.  Not bad for being real.  That rocks.  Very nice.  There we go.  And again, the applause is not stopping.  Oh, my God.  You have the Jaeger cap machine hooked up outside.  It's nice and cold already.  What are we doing with the Jaeger cap machine? 
[01:13:00]  Shut up.  Okay, I walk in here, and there's like Jack Daniels.  The first thing I see, he's popping vodka bottles left and right.  I see there's the...  Oh, Captain Morgan.  I didn't even see the wrong one.  I show up yesterday?  What are you guys trying to tell me here?  The race is the most difficult.  We have Captain Morgan, we have Jack Daniels, we got the Great Goose, the Jaeger.  Jaeger.  And what do I get yesterday?  And hot chicks.  Hot chicks showing their breasts?  Nice.  Come on, man.

You helped us out today on the highways and the byways.  Like Kimmy did.  Yes.  And guys, please be very, very cold to the ladies, okay?  Because that's what we do.

Remember when Donnie got arrested back in November around Thanksgiving, and he was in  a hotel, and the story was that there was a woman with him.  It was Ally McKeel.  It was Calista Flockhart.  And in fact, a Wonder Woman costume was left behind.  Ronnie, you're on the radio chick.  Listen, Wonder Woman had a rack.  If it was Calista Flockhart, she would take you off this Wonder Woman suit, and you would 
[01:14:30]  wonder where's the woman.  The radio chick.  Weekdays, 9 to noon.  102.7.  WNEW.  Well, the party's over.  The grand opening is over.  But the excitement...  Anthony!  Yes.  WWF backlash.  Yeah, in the aftermath of WrestleMania, who will survive the backlash as events spin  out of control.

The four most dominant forces in the WWF are gonna wage war in a historic tag team 
[01:15:30]  match, which all three titles are on the line for.  Wow.  Mr. McMahon feels that his son, new WCW owner Shane McMahon, had been trying to recruit  over the Big Show and other WWF superstars.  In an effort to end Shane O'Mac's campaign, Mr. McMahon booked the Big Show and Shane in  a Last Man Standing match at Backlash.  What?

[01:17:00]  Our new friend Devin is in  studio. He played Buzz on Home Alone.  How you doing?  Hold it a sting!  Hold it a sting!  We have a bottle of Jack Daniels,  a bottle of Captain Morgan's,  two bottles of Grey Goose vodka,  and a shot machine outside the studio.  Also saw a six-pack of Sam Adams.  Sam Adams is in the house.  Of course, what the hell is going on?  Shots of Jägermeister.  This is not supposed to happen.  No, I won't do what you tell me. 
[01:17:30]  I won't do what you tell me.  Yeah, we were warned, but we haven't  re-signed yet here, so they don't want  to piss us off, so we get away with murder.  Geez.  We explain. It's like that movie  Twilight Zone with the kids.  How?  You sit next to Anthony.  Sit right here next to Anthony.  Anthony, what's for dinner tonight?  Oh, God, the kid who can do  whatever he wants.  Yeah, man.  Is this his mouth away?  Yeah.  She's sitting up in the room  watching those bad cartoons,  and her mouth is gone. 
[01:18:00]  That's us.  People run down the halls,  and the boss is saying,  do you know what Opie and Anthony  are doing?  And they're doing that.  You guys are an undisciplined child  wielding ultimate power.  Yes, we are.  So now it's turned into a booze fest.  Jesus.  We also have Kimmy from Survivor.  Yes.  Hello.  Who has wowed us already.  Yeah, you know what I want to do  is you guys really have to...  Okay.  No, because...  What?  Because I came up with an idea.  I need to make a sticker 
[01:18:30]  that says I wowed  that I can stick on my car.  That way the men know  what car that I'm in  to wow.  I've seen the I wows.  Girls just taking the wow stickers  and just kind of putting an eye  and stuff there.  Yeah, because that's what  you have to do  because it's so hard  when you're driving down.  It's like, hello,  I got boobs to show you,  and I'm just not paying attention.  Well, people are not paying  enough attention to you,  and you're trying to get people  to show more boobs?  We hear it all the time  that girls call in like,  I want a wow.  Guys are passing me  with their wow stickers,  and they're not paying attention.  Unbelievable.  I'm here. 
[01:19:00]  I'm waiting.  My bra's undone.  I'm ready to go,  but the guy just zoomed  right by me.  Unreal.  Or they say that you're stalking them  because it's like you're  slowing down,  and you're like,  roll down your window.  I'm going to show you my cans.  Why do you have to try  and track these guys down?  They're cool.  Well, yeah.  Imagine the poor guy  that doesn't even know it.  He's just driving.  You're right on his quarter panel  or something like that.  And you want to wow,  and he just has no clue  that he just lost out  on a celebrity wow.  You know,  I have to say,  this was my first wow ever. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, yay.  A virgin.  First wow ever,  and it was by Kimmy.  It was great, too, wasn't it?  It was awesome.  She's going to get into  a whipped cream bikini  in a little while.  Now, who's the girl?  That's going to be the showstopper,  I swear to God.  Now I believe anything she says.  I've changed my whole tune with her.  I have done everything  that you have asked.  I did what's in my pants.  I told you I would wow.  I've come when I said.  Well, not waiting for her.  Now, who's the other girl  that was coming in?  All I'm hearing is  She's really, really hot. 
[01:20:00]  They're beautiful girls out there.  Yeah, there's a couple girls out there.  They're both very, very cute.  Yeah, I'm going to wear  a big old bikini, though.  Here you go.  I'm doing this for fun.  Could be.  Yes, she is.  It's like an exhibition thing  you're doing.  Exactly.  I'm licking the whipped cream  off of her.  You want to lick  the whipped cream off of her?  This girl's beautiful.  What's your name?  Could we be formally introduced?  We can get the lesbian couch  in here in two seconds.  We'll be very formally introduced.  Yes.  Very intimate, close,  personal friends. 
[01:20:30]  What's your name?  Yoya.  Are you a dancer?  No.  I mean, I didn't mean  to insult you,  but you've got the body for it.  Are you a physicist?  I have bikiniqueen.com  on the internet.  That's cool.  Ah.  I don't care.  A website.  Very good.  And she's going to get  into the whipped cream bikini,  Anthony.  Yes.  We've got a trip to Hawaii,  ladies.  What are you waiting for?  Come on down here  sometime this week  and show us what you've got.  What's your name?  Nayoka.  Nayoka is not too.  All right.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Do you know everyone in the room?  Uh, no. 
[01:21:00]  This is Buzz from Home Alone.  How are you doing?  I'm also known as McCauley.  Oh.  Hey, I like your tattoo.  What's that up?  Oh, it's really, really bad.  Why?  Because I don't know.  Oh, you don't like it?  Well, what is it?  Let's see.  We're going to see it  in the bikini.  I know.  It's a fairy,  but it was done  like when I was 15 years old.  My God, it's Richard Simmons.  It's a fairy.  It's a fairy.  But you don't like it?  No.  Well, wrong placement.  Well, how old are you now?  Fairy doesn't want to get too close  to what you're sporting there. 
[01:21:30]  Twenty-one.  Cool.  What are you, engine?  Yeah.  Are you?  Yeah.  Hi, uh, uh, uh.  She's got to be in so long hair.  She got that engine hair.  How much engine, though?  Probably just a little taste, right?  Uh, I don't know.  One-eighth, one-sixty.  One-eighth score.  Yes, heap them good.  Something like that.  Naoka.  That means, like,  will whip cream bikini wearing.  That's what it translates to?  Modern day.  Dances with whip cream?  Modern day engine.  We call you, uh,  double down. 
[01:22:00]  Call you, uh,  split-em,  split-em eights.  Very good.  We call you Virginia rolled gold.  Well, ladies,  you want to get into your whip cream or what?  Yeah, we're ready.  You ready?  Huh?  Where is this?  Outside the studio.  You make a way outside shooting craps.  We're going to join you guys  with some microphones  in a few minutes.  Uh,  in a few minutes.  Do you guys mind if I, uh,  get in?  Well, 
[01:22:30]  scope it out.  Buzz has found his calling.  Scoop it out.  Someone tell us when they're, uh,  completely naked, okay?  All right.  We have to go to Marissa,  who's been, uh,  patiently holding here.  Marissa?  Marissa.  Melissa.  It says Marissa on the line.  Marissa.  It's actually not my real name.  It's my, um,  Marissa Manor.  That would be my porn name.  All right.  That's your porn name?  Yeah, you remember?  First,  middle name,  first name of the street.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We did that a bit a while ago.  Now,  all right,  Melissa.  Marissa,  I wanted you.  All right, 
[01:23:00]  hold on,  hold on,  hold on.  We know what you want to say,  and I think you,  I think you got to leave it to us  so we can get this on the radio.  Anthony,  if you will.  Okay.  Um,  it says last night  was the first night  you ever did  blank.  Balloon knot action.  Very good.  Just call it.  Welcome to the club.  Just call it.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  yeah.  That would be correct.  Kimmy,  can you make yours breathe  like the girl  from the other day, 
[01:23:30]  though?  No,  I don't have those  other skills.  All right.  All right,  Marissa.  Melissa.  Melissa.  Could someone fix that  on a goddamn screen?  How am I supposed  to go into  a goddamn  death dedication?  Hi.  All right,  there you go.  Melissa.  Apparently the person  who wrote it  was Japanese.  Marissa.  Oh.  So,  now,  last night,  the first night  you got balloon  knot action.  How old are you?  27.  27.  And what,  what made you wait  so long?  Um, 
[01:24:00]  I don't know.  I was always  very afraid to do it.  Yeah,  how did this guy  weasel his way?  Yeah,  how did he talk you  into it?  Yeah.  He didn't have to  talk me into it.  What do you mean?  He didn't have to  talk me into it.  Hold on,  hold on,  hold on.  All right.  Not sure how much  of that is going  to get through.  Slow down.  We can't even  really have  descriptions that  are anything more  than completely  vague.  So,  what he did was,  first,  there was maybe  a few digits  involved. 
[01:24:30]  Let's just say  some digits involved.  Some manual labor,  perhaps.  Right,  manual labor.  And that led  to you saying,  hey,  what the hell?  I think,  you know,  if that's possible,  then the other  thing's possible.  Yeah,  well,  actually,  we had discussed  it earlier in the day.  I told him I had  never done that.  And he told me  that he had never  done that.  How much?  A couple of digits  and then a punch  in the face,  Opie?  There you are.  They're ready.  They're loosened up.  How much alcohol  was involved?  Yeah.  None.  None?  Look at you.  Alcohol makes it 
[01:25:00]  better, though.  Wow.  And we got plenty  in here.  So,  Melissa,  how did you enjoy it?  Um,  it was,  it was really,  really good.  Oh.  It was a whore.  Wow.  So,  you like it now.  Yeah.  Like,  what was I waiting for?  Exactly.  Ouch.  Did he give you  the reach around? 
[01:25:30]  Um,  of course.  And now you,  uh,  yeah,  you're into it.  How were,  how were you positioned?  Turkey style.  Did that get through?  See,  no,  no,  it totally got through,  but everyone just kind of,  everyone stopped,  didn't talk,  and pictured it.  Yeah.  All right.  Now give us a little  description of yourself.  Okay.  Um,  let's see.  I'm 4'10",  250.  No,  no,  no.  I wrecked the whole thing.  Um,  about 5'5", 
[01:26:00]  um,  130.  A lot of back hair?  No.  Yeah.  Strawberry blonde.  Nice.  Okay.  Um,  blue eyes.  Oh,  delicious.  Yeah.  Um,  let's see.  Very,  very large chest.  Really?  How large are you talking?  Um,  38 triple D.  So you're used to getting the TF,  right?  Actually,  I don't like that.  What?  At all.  What?  Because it's not for you,  honey.  The TF is not for you. 
[01:26:30]  I don't like it.  The TF isn't for you.  It's for you.  It's for the guy.  Oh.  Well,  I'm really good.  I'll leave you a little something when he's done.  I'm really good at other things,  so.  Oh,  really?  I don't need to do that yet.  I bet you are.  So,  um,  very good.  Pure debauchery.  That,  that is a very nice story.  You're,  you're welcome to the wonderful world of balloon knot pleasure.  I,  I just hope that all my co-workers that,  uh,  um,  at the laboratory are not listening. 
[01:27:00]  Nah,  not many people listen to this show.  Don't worry about it.  Oh,  not too many,  right?  And they,  and you're using the fake name,  Melissa.  Oh,  yeah.  Melissa,  her real name is Barbara.  What were the other things you said you were good at?  Um,  do I have to say?  I don't think I can say it.  Well,  no,  no.  You said everything out.  You don't have to spell it out.  You said you were good at certain things.  Was it bobbing for dignity?  Is that what we got here from you?  That's the thing.  There you go.  You're,  you're good at that.  Now,  did he use something, 
[01:27:30]  uh,  any type of,  um,  lubricant?  No.  No?  Didn't need to.  Wow.  You guys are all,  whoosh.  Prison lube.  Oh,  nice.  Didn't need that.  Didn't need that.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Did he do that first?  All right.  And you're nice and clean back there?  No hair or nothing?  No,  no.  I'm completely shaved.  And you felt like you had to share this with us today,  man.  I had to.  We love our listeners. 
[01:28:00]  That rocks.  Thank you,  Melissa.  You're welcome.  All right.  And you guys,  I love you guys.  Well,  we love you.  Wow.  Oh,  yeah.  All right.  I have to take a shower.  Feeling dirty?  I feel filthy.  All right,  we're going to let you go,  okay?  What a great little story.  Bravo.  Yeah,  The Old Dirt Road,  they call it.  The Long and Wine.  Yeah.  That's a winner.  How's that for a topper? 
[01:28:30]  Paul,  what's going on?  Oh,  man,  I'm telling you,  it's hard for me to drive right now.  I've got to pull over.  What?  That was a good little story right there.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  she didn't give her number out.  Yeah,  she's got the boyfriend and stuff,  and you're insane.  So what?  She just kind of,  she just wanted to share with us today.  All right,  all right.  Well,  anytime she wants to share some more.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care,  guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right,  should we take a break? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah,  we can take a little breather,  and then get to some whipped cream action,  maybe.  Yeah,  the girls are getting ready as we speak outside the studio.  Uh-huh.  Oh,  uh-huh.  We'll have more pictures from the whipped cream bikini contest on WNAW.com in a little while.  All these bottles still have the wrappers around it.  Yeah,  I know.  I'm not understanding.  It's going to be rough.  It's amazing.  Happy hour and six minutes.  All right,  Kimmy,  when are you going to be in the whipped cream bikini?  I have to wait for my partner, Jeff,  to help me.  Can we give a ballpark time? 
[01:29:30]  Answer these two.  People are patiently waiting,  like 530-ish?  Yeah,  about 530-ish.  That sounds good.  Do you need a few drinks to loosen you up a little bit?  Oh,  boy,  if I have drinks,  I'm so not a drinker.  In two,  three drinks,  that's it.  I'm taking advantage of.  Very bad.  Oh,  nice.  Get the Jager.  Very bad.  You know what?  I got two bottles now.  You know what?  Stinky's slacking.  I know.  The old Stinky would have had a drink in front of Timmy's.  I'm feeling no love right now.  You're slacking.  For what? 
[01:30:00]  I have no drinks.  I got nothing.  Nothing.  When she gets drunk,  she's easy.  Where's her drink?  You're slacking.  You are totally slacking, man.  Ask her what she needs.  What do you need?  What do you like?  Name your poison.  You know what I will do?  I will have a shot of Jager Meister  seeing how we have  it chilling here  so very nicely.  Stinky,  go.  Stinky,  I give you  30 seconds.  Now.  Now.  29.  28.  Jager Meister.  Jager Meister. 
[01:30:30]  26.  Stinky,  it's a girl.  Stinky,  it's a girl.  Jager Meister.  Yummy.  Marie doesn't want to rain on our parade.  Marie.  Yeah.  What's going on?  I just wanted to,  I hate to rain on your guys' parade,  but that girl was totally full of it.  Why?  There's no way that she had  balloon knot action  and didn't use any kind of lube.  It's impossible.  No, it isn't.  It is possible.  No, it isn't.  Give me his word for it, please.  Listen to Kimmy.  Marie, you are ruining it. 
[01:31:00]  What?  Marie, you never heard of  a 30 seconds?  I got to take a 30 seconds.  Yeah, but she said  she didn't use anything.  No, natural lube,  just where the heat of the moment  makes its own,  you know what I mean?  Well, if she could do it,  I don't know.  I don't believe it for a second.  I did it for the first time  the other day  and there's no way.  Well, let's hear about it.  What happened?  Maybe she had a smaller  applicator.  Yeah, maybe she's going  out with an Asian guy.  Now, Marie.  Marie, you had balloon knot action 
[01:31:30]  first time  a couple of days ago.  And how old are you?  20.  You're 20  and how did you talk you into it?  Was there booze?  No.  No?  No.  You know,  some people earn it  after a while.  Earn it.  So he put in his time  and how did he make the move?  Excuse me?  Anyway.  How did he make his move? 
[01:32:00]  He just asked.  He asked you?  Nicely.  He asked you?  That's all it takes  to ask nicely, huh?  Well, you know,  if you put in your time  and you earn it,  then, you know.  So now you have a decision  to make right after he asks.  It's going through your head.  You know you've never  done this before.  But what's going through your mind?  Well.  That you said,  yeah, what the hell,  give it a shot.  Yeah, basically.  And how did it, uh...  Hey, hey, hey.  That's my mic.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I pressed the wrong one.  Oh, my God.  I pressed the cough button  on mine.  I'm sorry.  And how did it go? 
[01:32:30]  It went well.  It went very well.  Now, he started out  with maybe some manual action.  Yeah.  And then worked his way.  If he was counting on his hands,  what would he have counted up to?  Um, two.  Two?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm just holding up two fingers  and looking at it.  All right.  That's good.  That's good.  And then he decided,  all right, you're ready.  Yeah.  And you used the lube?  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  What'd you use?  Well, just baby oil.  Baby oil?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And how did it go?  Did it hurt?  Oh, it's called baby oil.  It's supposed to be used on babies.  Wow.  You're a little too old for it.  Yeah, okay.  So, it was nice and slow  and, um...  After 13, it didn't hurt.  Well, I mean, yeah, it does,  but, you know.  Hey, Melissa's back in the line.  Melissa.  Hi.  Hi.  Marie's saying you're full of S.  I hear that.  Um, well, it's me. 
[01:33:30]  What was that?  I totally missed that.  Hold on, hold on.  They had to dump out of that.  Damn it.  If my boyfriend gets them hotter for it.  Right.  Well, maybe...  Well, maybe it would be...  It's me to accommodate as much as I did.  So, you know, some girls are luckier than others.  I don't know about that.  Accommodate as much.  Oh, I see.  Now she's talking up the boyfriend.  Right.  He's calling me the, uh, Mississippi River.  That's my nickname. 
[01:34:00]  The Mississippi River.  You must be so proud.  Yes.  Well, Marie, what are...  Are you like the Lincoln...  You know, the...  You know, what are you...  You know the Mississippi River is a little on the muddy side.  It's all muddy.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe he's licking the muddy water.  Wow.  We could get all four of them in here,  and they could all just show up.  They could try it out.  Just show up.  This is the first for our show.  Two girls arguing over the balloon knot pleasure,  and the need or no need for a lubricant,  and a boyfriend sign.  Well, we went from one spot or the other very easily. 
[01:34:30]  That's the rule.  But we're not saying, like,  more time than more time,  if that's true.  But I just don't think it is.  But if it's true, that's good for her.  Yeah, we didn't use anything that wasn't natural.  Okay.  Well, that's great.  I hope, you know, I hope you guys...  Oh, natural.  You had a lot.  And congratulations to you, too.  Thank you.  I could listen to two girls talking about  balloon knot pleasure for the next hour.  Oh, please.  I know.  Now you know the other girl's going to go home  and graduate to the non-lubricated state valve. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, maybe I need to give myself the challenge.  All right.  Yeah.  Is this girl checking in with something?  Wait a minute.  If you need...  All right, hold on, hold on.  Maybe you should just concentrate on some leg squats  and get all prepared for it for tonight.  All right, Lisa wants in on this conversation here.  Lisa, you're on with Melissa and Marie.  Yeah, if you need lube, you're a loser.  Oh, why is that?  Oh, that's not...  Take it...  Now, honey, take it like a champ, okay? 
[01:35:30]  Take it like a champ.  Yeah.  Now, what do you mean by that?  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on, hold on.  Don't even go into anything that might be a little descriptive.  Right.  The whole point of it is to get it going without any help.  Right.  To park the car in the garage.  Are you into the pain of it or something?  Just a little bit of pain, but usually, you know,  a girl can have her own lubrication.  I mean, I have three other friends that, you know,  they take you back a little. 
[01:36:00]  When you've got a nickname, a butt plug,  you pretty much know what you're getting.  Of course, the pain is deadened by the spade shovel  to the back of the head.  That's the technique I like to use when they say,  ow.  Jesus Christ.  You girls rule, man.  Thank you, guys.  I like to give my girlfriend an epidural before I do it.  I'll stick back in when there's round two, okay?  All right.  Okay.  Have a good day, guys.  Bye, Kimmy.  Thanks, guys.  Bye. 
[01:36:30]  Thanks, girls.  Bye.  Lisa, Melissa, and Marie.  Some people, some of the girls enjoy the no-lube  because of a little pain.  Some like it.  I don't know.  It's a whole borderline.  I hope that ends up out.  Jimmy!  Yes.  I hope that ends up out.  Why don't you just ask the expert?  Yes, Kimmy.  Well, when did you first experience the pleasure  of Balloon Knot's pleasure?  A few years ago.  A few years back?  A few years ago.  And how did you decide that this was the time  and this was the guy?  It was something that I had in the back of my mind. 
[01:37:00]  Hopefully, it was a few shots of Jäger mic.  Yeah, a little bit.  It helps you relax and you just...  There you go.  You know.  And did you kind of just roll over  and give that inviting look?  Or did he pull the ups?  Yeah.  Some guys are like,  I didn't know.  And it's like,  well, you're halfway there.  You may as well finish.  Go for the home run.  Wow.  Right there in Kimmy's own outback.  There you go.  Nice. 
[01:37:30]  Nice.  Did it make you arrive?  Yes.  Can we say that?  Oh, yeah.  I've been learning how to do radio one day.  Right on.  Thank you.  Yesterday, you would have been a filthy mess.  And if Norton was here,  he'd be showing us how it's done.  I love him in this little bald head.  There you go.  And you enjoyed it?  It makes you arrive.  Yes.  Because you know what it is?  It's a different kind of stimulation.  No, I don't know how it is. 
[01:38:00]  You know, Andy.  You know how it is.  You know, and you've got a big C up the A.  Hey, hey.  Oh, look who's in here now.  It's Norton.  Norton.  I've got a head to rub.  Get over here now.  Yeah, a head to rub.  Insert joke here.  There you go.  You like that.  Jim, good to see you.  How are you, man?  Hey, you know what?  We're talking about balloon, not pleasure.  Balloon, not pleasure.  Yeah.  Girls are calling in saying they first had it like last night or a couple of days ago.  And it's fascinating, the story of how they decide now is the time. 
[01:38:30]  You know what it is?  It's a sneaky little thing in the back of your head.  And it's just, you know.  Not in the back of your head.  It could be sneaky.  It could be little.  You just get a couple of drinks and you just blame it on the alcohol or something.  Like I said, the guy has a little slip.  The slip.  That's really how he just slips.  Like he doesn't say anything to you.  But the slip means.  That's the most uncouth thing I've heard.  Yeah, and the slip means you're like totally going for it.  Like it's, let's just count.  One, two, one, two, one, two, one. 
[01:39:00]  It's like, whoa.  You can't slow down and all of a sudden get gentle with the slip move.  Because it's like, oh, it's an accident.  If you all of a sudden slow down and start being very slow and gentle, it's like, ah, you knew where you were going.  The slip move is like being pummeled.  Pouge.  Pouge.  It's kind of like when you're in the push-up position.  Yeah.  As me, as a woman would be in the push-up position. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  The push-up position.  You're in a push-up.  Yeah.  So that way, you know, you're all arched or whatever.  And then it's easier because you're relaxed.  And it's kind of you're not anticipating.  And then all of a sudden everything's relaxed already.  Okay.  Let's just ponder that for a second.  Hold on.  Everyone hold on.  A moment of silence for...  Oh!  Part of this team!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  This miserable crowd! 
[01:40:00]  All right.  It's a push-up position.  This is legal, isn't it?  A little back arch.  And then...  And you're ready to rock.  And you're ready to rock.  And...  He doesn't ask you anything.  He doesn't say anything to you.  I mean, he doesn't prepare you.  He doesn't, like...  Okay.  Okay.  You know what?  I've done it more than once now.  So it's like...  There you go.  Remember time one?  Nice!  Usually I just say, you tell your parents, your sister's dead.  Has the guy...  That's the easiest way I...  Has the guy ever...  Let's just say... 
[01:40:30]  How can I put this?  Has the guy ever prepared the area for you?  And let's just say, the way he's preparing the area, he wouldn't be able to whistle a tune  as he's doing it.  He gives an oral dissertation.  You know what?  Let me tell you.  I love that.  Oh!  Oh, yeah.  Look at how he puts his head in his hands.  I just met my wife.  Dude, that's what I was telling you about in the office.  The dirty penny.  Oh, God.  You better go to a doctor.  Or a mushroom.  It tastes like mushrooms. 
[01:41:00]  Mushrooms!  Yeah, shiitake mushrooms.  Hey, why aren't the girls making it up?  I don't know, man.  To me, it tastes like baby powder.  I don't...  She's talking to a ball back.  I don't know what she gets a 24-hour call back.  Hey, get with what we're talking about.  Balloon not pleasure.  I would never be a balloon not.  The first time I ever had it was with a girlfriend, and it looked like...  You ever step in mud? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, no.  You pull your foot out of the mud?  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  Well, you should have used your foot, Jordan.  Well, I was like doing a Duncan Hines commercial.  I was so irritated.  It's true.  I had to use a towel and wipe off with a towel and throw the towel down.  Oh, that's so wrong.  Jim, that has happened.  Sorry.  Disgusting.  What alley did you throw the towel down?  Okay.  That was called Exhibit B. 
[01:42:00]  Well, jeez, and Norton, did you burp her first at least?  I mean, come on.  You didn't save the towel to wipe the mace off your face?  Oh, yeah.  Give her a grandmother next time.  All right.  Grand mother.  Hey, Rick, what's going on with the girls?  They're on cell phones and stuff.  Wow.  Are they going to, you know...  We're going to get them naked.  All right, let's get them naked then, okay?  And we'll take a break.  Yes.  We'll continue here.  We'll be back.  All right, of course.  Just getting warmed up.  Rodney Dagefield should be here in minutes, 
[01:42:30]  and Kimmy's getting into our whipped cream.  Hey, let me tell you about my balloon nut.  In about 20 minutes.  I've got to tell you.  Can we all just ponder that for a moment, too?  Oh, Rodney.  So stick around.  Rem it, rem it, rem it.  Oopsie.  Cornhole.  Get ready for...  Ooh!  It's a whip-a-mouth-a-mouth day!  We're going on Anthony!  N-E-W.  Uh, Charlie, what's going on?  Uh, yeah, what's up, guys? 
[01:43:00]  Hey.  My girlfriend said that, uh...  I slipped once, actually.  My girlfriend said that she was, uh...  felt like she had a baby.  He killed over crying.  It wasn't that funny, man.  All right, Charlie, thank you.  Got it.  He writes, uh, or whatever it is, whoever's screening the phones, right?  He slipped with his girlfriend once, said it burned like fire.  Uh, let me see.  Oh, Jimmy from, uh, New Jersey, Anthony, really fast?  Yeah.  Oh, boy, I just can't decide if I'd rather listen to 56 more hours of Mike and the Mad Dog 
[01:43:30]  talking about 61, the new movie about Mantle and Maris, or Kimmy from Survivor talking  about, uh, having a big C in her A.  Why don't we talk about that, uh, Mikey?  I don't understand that I'm a fan.  We ought to do that.  We get better ratings.  And we talk about, how's your balloon out there, Mikey?  What about the first time you had a balloon out of pleasures, Mikey?  What was it?  A couple of digits first?  Uh, if we want to keep it on the, uh, sports, uh, field. 
[01:44:00]  How about a baseball bat, Mikey?  I got an autographed baseball bat here.  I'm Mike Piazza baseball bat, Mikey.  Bend over.  Find for some balloon out of pleasures.  How are we supposed to win in the ratings if we can't talk about balloon out of pleasure?  Mike from Queens, you're on the phone.  Talking about balloon out of pleasure.  Oh, very good.  Uh, what are we talking about?  Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Monkeying Around.  If you want to get some of this balloon out action.  I do.  Oh! 
[01:44:30]  I want Monkeying Around.  You want the Monkeying Around?  I do.  Something tells me, uh, you could get that in a shot of Jägermeister.  Monkeying Around.  It's from Pinnacle.  The same people that gave you a horny goat weed for the guys.  Now it's for the girls.  It's Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  You fan the flames of passion naturally with a potent blend of all natural exotic herbs,  including Monkey Taekwonyin.  It's an herb.  That's right.  It's from the Fukin province of China.  Jesus Christ.  I can never say that with a straight face.  Fukin.  Need we say more?  Yes.  The Fukin province of China. 
[01:45:00]  You'll be slipping and sliding and doing the gliding.  So for great romance and sex, remember the three Ps.  Pleasure, passion, and Pinnacle.  Pinnacle Monkeying Around.

[01:45:30]  New York.  It's the O&A Show.  We're doing a head count.  I think we have about 30 or 40 people around this place right now.  It's insane out in the little waiting area that we have.  There's a party going on.  There's girls getting whipped cream bikinis put on.  I know there's a Jägermeister machine out there that's pouring out ice-cold Jägermeister.  Lots and lots of shots.  Kimmy from Survivor has had a few shots.  She's going to be in a whipped cream bikini in a little while.  Not only that, but I think the machine is putting out a sound that is so high-pitched 
[01:46:00]  it could only be heard by Stephen Lynch,  who somehow found his way to the Jägermeister machine.  Somehow found his way to the Jägermeister machine.  I mean, there's naked women walking.  It's just a crazy, crazy scene here.  And then, look who walks in.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Rodney.  Hey, Rodney.  How you are?  You are.  You are very nice.  And I just want to say I'm here, but I'm in the wrong place. 
[01:46:30]  I'm looking to buy an ounce of pot, you know.  You want some pot?  Stinky, I'll hook you up with some weed, man.  I don't know what the hell happened here, you know.  You want to take a stick to this?  But I'll tell you what, as I'm talking to you right now,  look at these people as we're talking, as we speak.  He's in the plane.  As we speak.  Don't mind me, okay?  But you heard as we speak, right?  Yeah, we did.  As we're having intercourse.  He's in the plane right now.  Whatever, okay.  Rodney, you like the pot?  My wife is, uh...  You like smoking the weed?  The lemonade you gave me?  No, no.  But as I'm talking to you right now, as we speak, 
[01:47:00]  my daughter is in Lenny's Hill Hospital in labor right now.  True.  Are you kidding?  And you're with us?  And I figure, hey, what's more important?  I'll have labor or me being here?  You know what I mean?  Hey, good call.  Good call.  You know what I mean?  Anyway, anyway, now I've got a big job.  I've got to find her a husband, you know.  But anyway, I want to just say to the people here, though,  that if they want to see me live,  I'll be working at the New Jersey Performing Arts in Newark. 
[01:47:30]  And, uh...  The beautiful town in Newark.  That's right.  And also, I'm working at Avery Fisher Hall.  I'm working here on Sunday, the 29th in Newark.  Eight New Jersey Performing Arts.  And the night, I'm going to plug, okay?  That's okay.  I'm working right here in New York in the Avery Fisher Theater.  Is that right?  May 9th.  Uh, that's Avery Fisher Hall.  Avery Fisher Hall.  Sounds like a trio in Vaughn.  And here they are now.  Avery Fisher and Hall.  Make them happy.  What do you say now?  Okay.  But I'm working there on May 9th. 
[01:48:00]  And if you want to let your head down, I mean way down.  Because I do act ahead with Vegas and no children allowed,  whatever it is, and we have a lot of fun.  How are we supposed to find dates?  No children allowed.  Why don't you call up the guy I used to go with?  But anyway, that's my story.  Anyway, come and see me because I need the rent, you know?  Yeah.  I was going to invite Rodney to the stairwell for a little, uh...  Things are not good either.  For some pot?  For some pot.  Yeah, I've heard that you still, uh, like smoking a joint or two. 
[01:48:30]  Well, make it an ounce or two.  Yeah?  What the hell's a joint?  I don't know.  We could hook you up.  Well, it's either that or trying to control myself, and it's difficult.  But, uh, I don't drink too much, although I tend to go drinking to my wife, you know?  And I was out as I drink, you know, I go to drinks.  She said, she cut me off, you know what I want to drink.  She says, you're drunk enough for me.  I told her, I told her, I says, I'm never drunk enough for you, you know? 
[01:49:00]  It's okay.  It's tough to get a big laugh for an audience of four, you know?  But they are good.  They're good, they're good.  I love it here, love it.  What do you think of all the naked women, uh, walking around?  Have you seen that in there?  Well, where, where?  You walked right by.  I saw one, I ran white in the men's room.  Ouch.  And, uh, that's my story here.  You can also go to Dangerfields, my club here in New York. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  How long you had that now?  This is, like, yeah.  Dangerfields is the oldest running nightclub in the history of nightclubs.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We just celebrated, well, it's only the 32nd anniversary.  We had the 31.  Nice.  32 years.  No nightclub has existed that long in the history of nightclubs.  You know who we're good friends with?  Uh, that you broke on, uh, one of your comedy specials.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Oh, yes.  The Dice Man.  The Dice Man.  The Dice Man.  He comes on the show a lot.  Oh, he does.  Yeah, and I remember, I remember watching the episode of, uh, the Rodney Dangerfields, uh, 
[01:50:00]  the, it was a young comedian special.  Yeah.  That you were doing, and, uh, Dice comes out.  Like, who the hell is this guy?  And he starts his act, and it was like nothing I ever saw before, which was like a lot of  the comics out of there.  Roseanne was another one.  He's doing great.  I, I, I, I haven't thought you were going to do that.  He belongs in a garage, really.  You know, but, uh, there are a lot of guys who, uh, I had my show who did great.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the whole list, I don't name them all.  Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey.  Kenison.  I know more.  Bob Ethler.  Kenison was a giant.  Yeah.  He was a genius, wasn't he? 
[01:50:30]  I found Sam Kenison.  I was, uh, playing in a place called the Arena in Houston, uh, 15, 20 years ago, and  went to a comedy club afterwards, and he was there, you know?  Yeah.  And he wasn't perfected at all, but he was funny, you know?  And, uh, I met him years later, and, uh, whatever.  We became dear friends, and I had my, on two of my shows, and he was a giant.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had a doubt.  Absolute giant.  Yeah, I had a doubt.  Too many of those, uh.  You missed the Kenison.  Oh, yeah.  He was great, huh?  He ever do that bit of, uh, he was going to come up with the boys to Vegas, and, uh, that's 
[01:51:00]  right.  No, no, she won't be.  Hold on, I'll ask her, okay?  Honey, all the guys are bringing that.  No way.  She says, no, no.  Sam was an absolute giant, and I miss him terribly, and, uh, if he was here, I'm sure  he'd come to see me at one of those places.  Right on.  Well, you put him in, uh, uh, Back to School.  Back to School. 
[01:51:30]  I put him in that.  He was great.  That was a good one for him, the teacher.  Uh, Robert Downey Jr. was in that movie, too.  Yeah, he was in that movie, too.  Yeah.  He was in Back to School, yeah.  He likes a little more than the pot, the Robert Downey Jr.  They can't keep him off the dope.  I'd say he's the nicest guy in the world, you know?  Sure, he's always effed up.  He's got to be a nice guy.  Effed up.  Yeah, you see, we've got to use the code words.  Did you learn that in Britain?  You've got to use the code words.  We can only use the first letter of the...  Come on, dear, we're leaving.  What the hell is this? 
[01:52:00]  Three o'clock in the morning?  Well, we had to dump out of that.  I use a bad word.  I know.  I use the worst word ever.  Now we're officially out of delay.  Don't get started, okay?  I hear you.  Because I can curse for heaven without repeating myself.  You know what I mean?  Are you doing any other movies? 
[01:52:30]  Because I tell you...  I finished a movie recently called The Fourth Tenor.  Just finished it.  And I'm not going to brag about it.  But, you know, every time you make a movie, you think you're making go with the wind.  This is it.  Boy, oh boy.  It comes out into the toilet.  You never know.  Well, goddamn Caddyshack was one of the...  It's a classic comedy.  A classic.  Hey, we know that.  What else is new?  Well, I'm trying to kiss your ass a little, Rodney.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Come on. 
[01:53:00]  Remember that?  Your car.  That was awesome.  The cops are here.  No, no, he just jumped.  But his whole face sucks.  That's right, it sucks.  Flashback.  Flashback.  Rodney, just before you got here, we were talking about balloon not pleasure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, that's another code word we've got to use.  Because we can't really talk in depth about sexual activity.  So we say balloon not pleasure.  Hey, everybody. 
[01:53:30]  We're all going to get laid.  Now, Rodney.  Do I get paid to back?  Yeah, you got the checks in the mail.  The checks in the mail.  I'm a bungle.  What check?  Hey, that's my entire defense.  Now, Rodney, you ever look into a balloon, like you blow up a balloon, you tie it in a knot,  and you ever look right into the knot?  I heard you on the radio coming over.  All right.  Then you know what a balloon not is.  I know what a balloon not is.  All right.  Well, we were talking about a little bit about that.  And, you know, you've had a long, illustrious career in showbiz. 
[01:54:00]  I wonder if you have any advice, maybe.  I pick artistic subjects.  We try.  You want to hear the first time I got laid, I play all-star, all right?  All right.  I want to show this is.  Hey, tell those two to stop screwing over there, all right?  Put the coat down.  Put the coat down.  Oh, baby, it's time.  Shoot me up again.  You feel me?  It's kind of accurate, because this place is really out of control today.  You should listen to this place every day. 
[01:54:30]  You'll hear something you consume.  Absolutely.  Where's the girls with the whipped cream?  Yeah.  Where's the girls?  We ought to bring one in.  You want the girls?  I like whipped cream.  Yeah.  Yeah, bring one of the girls in.  Bring one in.  There you go.  Look at this.  But Rodney's wife's right there, though, all right?  My wife goes 18 ways or so.  Quite a look at that, Rodney.  You did all right. 
[01:55:00]  You did all right.  Very attractive.  Caused me a fortune.  I mean, beauty, Mark, you see, caused me 18 years, all right?  Well worth it.  Should we, uh, do you want a flash, Rodney?  A little wow?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, check that out.  Oh, yeah.  Bravo.  I didn't see it.  All right, big girl.  They say, honey, you'll never drown. 
[01:55:30]  Full flotation.  Beautiful.  Very nice.  And now, now, you did your whipped cream bikini?  Look what I'm doing at my age.  Ridiculous.  Isn't that great, though?  We are looking for rich gay guys.  I don't know what to do.  Very good, Rodney.  Pick a subject.  Pick a subject?  Ask me anything.  Go ahead.  Jeez, a subject.  Things I know about drugs, prostitution.  All right.  How about, uh, slutty girls?  Slutty girls. 
[01:56:00]  Let's leave my family out.  What a topic, slutty girls.  Well, yeah, I hear, because you've talked about, uh, your family and stuff and the backseat  of car.  I don't know what you're familiar with.  What's that with you?  What, slutty girls?  Slutty boys.  We're at home.  Look, he's calling me a faggot.  I'm laughing my ass off.  Well, it's Rodney.  I know.  Hey, Rodney, can you...  You always laugh at accuracy.  Can you stick around for a few minutes or what? 
[01:56:30]  Sure.  All right, we've got to just take a quick break.  A quick break?  Yeah, and we'll be back.  All right.  If you want, you can go to the stairwell with Stinky.  Stinky will get you stoned, man.  Get Stinky in here.  Stinky's got some of the best pot on the face of the earth.  I'll be like him back here, like, what a stone man, huh?  Hey, Stinky, you want to give it up?  I'll tell you about the hippest guy in the whole world.  Yeah.  I'm going back 30 years, right?  Yeah.  There was a musician hung around Hanson's drugstore before your time, and a friend of  mine, Eddie Schein, right?  So this guy was a little friendly with us, so I noticed he was, like, cold to us, you  know? 
[01:57:00]  So I said to him, everything all right?  You mad at us or something?  And he went exactly like this.  Like, uh, I'm mad there.  What the hell?  That was it.  That volume.  Like, I'm mad there.  He told me off.  That's all.  He was nothing.  He was smoking the weed.  It was like you're making one person laugh.  Hey, Stinky, what kind of pot would you suggest, Rodney, smoking?  Some AK-47. 
[01:57:30]  Some white.  There's so many different kinds of pot.  Northern lights, purple haze.  Chicago green?  Chicago green?  Sure.  Chicago green.  Acapulco purple?  All right, we'll take a break, and we'll come back with Rodney Danger.  Yes, yes.  Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One big door.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:58:00]  Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  What is that?  Like some kind of guy's name?  Like some kind of sexist guy's name?  Yeah!  You will not get away with this.  I wish you could just shut your big head up there.  It's Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Ooh, bah, nah.  Obi and Anthony.  N-E-W.  I must say, this is a thrill today.  Rodney Dangerfield in the studio.  Everyone taking pictures with Rodney.  Obviously, no one warned Rodney about us. 
[01:58:30]  I guess not.  He's taking pictures like crazy, Anthony.  Yeah, a lot of people getting the photos with Rodney.  That's right.  Are we on?  Yeah.  Who came in?  Uh, no, there's no one.  Same group.  It's the same group of schmucks.  You have plenty to say.  You don't have it at all.  You like Jägermeister?  Jägermeister?  Yeah, that's that little shot that you do.  I don't know. 
[01:59:00]  I can't pronounce the word.  How can I live?  Maybe a poison.  We got booze all over the place.  Booze, yeah.  I don't know how that happened.  You still drink a little bit?  Oh, only when I get drunk.  Yeah.  You're fitting great here, then.  Drinking is a cute thing.  It's nice, you know.  It's cute.  It is very cute, you know.  Yeah.  When I drink, I don't know what I'm doing.  No.  The other night, I got a loader.  I said, I'll make an obscene phone call, you know.  I got in full of loader and said, baby, how's he right now?  I'd show you sex, you freak.  I'd turn you upside down. 
[01:59:30]  I'd bang your ass.  I was talking to my son.  I think they dumped that on Rodney's story.  Hey, I'm going to stay in this business.  What?  I'm sure.  Sure.  Rodney is playing this Sunday at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.  Some tickets available.  Not many, man.  These tickets are flying.  He's playing all over the tri-state area, and all the shows are selling out.  Now, you can see him at New Jersey Performing Arts Center Sunday, and also at Avery Fisher 
[02:00:00]  Hall, May 9th.  So, call to get your tickets to see Rodney Dangerfield.  A legend in the business.  I could listen this all day.  Sure.  You guys don't really know me, do you?  Do you know what we put aside to speak to you today?  What did you put aside?  The naked girls in whipped cream.  The naked girls in whipped cream?  Yeah, naked girls in whipped cream.  Do you know, you ever watch that show Survivor on TV?  It's one of those reality shows.  No, I'm busy trying to survive. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  When I was born, I told her,  Hey, Doc, I'm fine.  I was so ugly, my father saw the umbilical cord, he hung himself.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we're thumping out.  Will you come and see me?  Wait, wait, wait, we're out of delay, we can't... 
[02:01:00]  I couldn't understand myself there, what did I say?  We're out of delay.  Tell me what I said.  Because now all the curses will go through and we'll get in big trouble.  You can't use the F word anymore.  I didn't.  It was a double word.  You like big gals, Rodney, big gals, you know.  I think you're putting to the breasts of the big gals.  No, no, no, no, just big all over.  You want to see a mess of a woman? 
[02:01:30]  A mess of a woman.  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  That's Mindy.  I told my first wife I'd never talk about it.  Look at this girl here.  This is Mindy.  How are you, Mindy?  How are you?  Oh, see, look, you live alone.  So nice to see you, right?  What do you do?  Sit on his lap.  Sit on his lap.  What are you losing weight?  Are you wearing a corset?  There's enough there for the...  There's enough there for the three of us, me, you, and then me again. 
[02:02:00]  You'll never drown either.  That's a big woman, huh, Rodney?  She's a big girl.  What prompted you to go into accounting?  You said yourself, the hell with that Burgo joint, right?  You like...  I get naked for a living.  You get naked for a living? 
[02:02:30]  Yes, I do.  I publish a big butt magazine.  Oh, are you going to bachelor parties?  No, I don't.  What do you get naked for a living?  Publishes Big Butt Magazine.  I'm the publisher of Big Butt Magazine, and I get naked every month.  In fact, I just showed Opie.  The June issue actually has...  I did a Friday fake-o a few months ago, and the whole story is in there.  Well, I want you to come see me, okay?  Okay.  I'll be in New Jersey for putting me on. 
[02:03:00]  Actually, I live in New Jersey now.  I'm talking here.  Manny never knows when to shut up.  I can't get a word in here.  I'm inviting you to see my show at the New Jersey Performing Arts on Sunday.  It's coming Sunday, the 29th, and also A.B. Fisher Hall.  May 9th.  Or May 9th, right?  Yeah, I got it.  I'm helping you out, Rodney. 
[02:03:30]  You and me, man.  I got a nickel here.  May 9th, Wednesday, A.B. Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center.  Come over there, okay?  I won't be there.  And I'll show you to the audience.  Hey, Rodney.  Rodney, you want to see a really disturbing ass?  A disturbing ass?  Yeah, you want to see what she's packing?  This is really disturbing.  Oh, and I wore a thong today, too.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  Say it's not so.  Look at Rodney's wife.  Look at Rodney's wife. 
[02:04:00]  I've never been asked before to look at a very disturbing body.  Now, back away a little bit, because I don't know how that's going to explode.  Yeah, don't get too close to Rodney.  Yeah, now, go toward the door.  Right.  There you go.  Okay, everybody.  Because we, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  We've seen worse.  Wow.  We've seen worse?  I'm waiting to see an American Indian throw a spear at that.  You come here often? 
[02:04:30]  I love you more now.  Not do I love you more.  Are you kidding?  Yes, I come on.  I wish you had a body like that, boy.  Really?  In fact, I wish you had two bodies like that.  You're into big girls at all, Rodney?  I'm not into big girls at all.  Huh?  What's she wearing?  She's all wrapped up.  She's wrapped up like a yodel.  She's wearing a corset.  Rodney, what do you think?  What do you think?  What do I think?  I think she works at prisons to cure sex offenders.  What do you think? 
[02:05:00]  Wow!  Light of the day.  With that corset, she looks like an hourglass that has about five hours of sand in it.  Wow.  Look at this.  That is a lot of bunt.  Are you going outside like this?  Outside.  I have.  You have.  Are you going to take me outside?  I'll take you inside.  I'll take you inside out. 
[02:05:30]  Wow!  Well, that's interesting.  Mandy, did you come down here to be in the whipped cream bikini condo?  Yes, and I'm hoping that, you know, they can put enough whipped cream on me with only one can.  One can?  Let me use a fire hose.  Foam the runway.  The thing they use at the airport.  How about a pickup truck?  Yeah, and I was hoping that maybe there would be guys that would be doing it and I can help, you know.  Wake up, Mandy.  Wake up. 
[02:06:00]  You're dreaming again.  You know.  All right, Mandy.  Thanks for coming on the show today.  All right.  Thank you.  Now, where is Rodney appearing in the area?  Rodney will be at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center this Sunday.  Buddy, keep it up.  I won't show up.  I know how to hurt myself, boy.  And Avery Fisher Hall, May 9th.  I forgot, my friend, this coming Sunday, New Jersey Performing Arts in Newark.  Newark's a strange place, Newark.  This is the guy you guys all learned it from. 
[02:06:30]  The population never changes.  Every time a kid is born, some guy leaves town.  Anyway, on the last Sunday, Newark Performing Arts on May 9th, Wednesday, in New York in the Avery Fisher Hall.  Right on.  As I told you before, this is not for children.  You want to let your head down, way, way down, I'll say things I shouldn't say.  I can't say on radio or television.  Right, a little bit.  Well, it hasn't stopped you so far.  This show, you can say anything.  No, you really can't.  So I had this brought against the wall. 
[02:07:00]  I said, hey, honey, back up.  Oh, my God.  Rodney Dangerfield.  I should be arrested.  Yeah.  How's the health these days?  You've been to, who is that, Dr. Vinnie Bumont?  I got to operate two of them recently.  Double bypass, a big hernia here.  Aneurysm, I order.  You don't know what that is, but that's the heaviest you can get.  In fact, I'm being involved now with some people who I'm going to talk about having an examination for you. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, that's what I'm going to die.  You know, no sign.  You'll die first.  You'll see the wall die from that.  Albert Einstein, you know.  You're in good company.  Well, yeah, I'm in good company.  Well, I don't want to be considered in good company when I'm dead.  Exactly.  What the hell is that?  I'm in good company.  I was trying to, I don't know, just trying to put a positive spin on it.  After the show, you and I go in the men's room and have it out together. 
[02:08:00]  It's trying to, Rodney's pissed at you.  It's trying to turn lemon into lemonade there.  Look, I know myself.  I'll be all right.  I'll be all right.  He's getting a little emotional, a little serious there, and you know, that's Rodney.  Look, you know I go for you.  You're taking advantage of it.  That's what it is.  What you want to know now?  Where I'm working?  Oh, no.  Oh, gee.  Huh?  I can tell you a dirty joke.  Is that all right?  Yeah.  Let it rock. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, this guy.  No girl would make it with this guy.  What was written in this guy's extension was the word Shorty.  Finally, one girl felt sorry for him as she made it with him.  Her friend said, how do you make good guys' name was Shorty in his extension?  She said, I understand.  True enough, it was a Shorty.  But when he became aroused, it said Shorty's Pizzeria and Restaurant.  Orders promptly delivered.  In business since 1928.  Baking done on premises.  This guy.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:09:00]  That's only a sample.  What you get in June, June, Performing Arts.  A religion in the mood.  And every official in New York.  Yes.  Uncle John.  I'm dying, guys.  I'm dying.  Coke.  Rodney.  Any more comedy?  John.  Coke.  Hold on, Uncle John.  Drink a Coke.  What's so funny about that?  Oh.  Hey, Rodney, we got a guy on the line that wants to say hi.  Uncle John.  Rodney, you are the Jack Nicklaus of comedy, man.  You have been so good for so long.  How old are you, sir?  God bless you, man. 
[02:09:30]  How old are you, sir?  I'm 46.  Oh, I wish I was 46.  That's a great age.  You don't play your broads, man.  Well, thank you very much, sir, for your comedy.  My pleasure.  So, where do you live?  Hey, I'll be seeing you Sunday at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.  And you live in Jersey?  I live in Linhurst, right nearby.  Oh.  I'll be looking forward to comedy.  Oh, I'll wave.  All right.  Will you wave?  Thanks, Rodney.  If I wave it back, you know I'm nuts.  All right?  I'll be seeing you, or you'll be seeing me Sunday, okay? 
[02:10:00]  You got it.  Thank you, sir.  All right, Uncle John.  Take care, guys.  We should let Rodney go, man.  Yeah, Rodney Dangerfield.  It's been a pleasure and an honor.  Well, what up?  What up?  That's all right.  What up?  I'll go.  But I won't forget this brush off.  Hey, wait.  You can hang if you want.  We were just being honest.  They told me you stay till six.  Oh, you can stay till six.  I guess I wasn't that good. 
[02:10:30]  They want to get rid of me.  No, no, no.  That's not true at all.  I'm at seven.  Yeah, you can stay till seven.  You can play with me, Rodney.  Rodney, would you like to get into a whipped cream bikini, maybe?  A whipped cream bikini, huh?  I'm going to be a cherry on top.  Sure, we have that.  We shot the Jägermeister.  We got some heroin.  We're going to go to some other building to find that.  Yeah, right?  All right.  No, we figured you'd want to leave, you know, and get some rest and stuff.  Okay, I'll leave.  No, no.  Oh, God.  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Nicely done.  Don't be throwing out Rodney Dangerfield.  I'm not throwing you out, Rodney.  Sorry.  You can take over the show.  Look.  I'm sorry.  You're all right.  I'm hurt.  Oh, no.  You're hurt.  And that's it.  And I hope we see each other again when I'm driving.  The other question.  The other question.  Everybody, everybody, everybody.  This is a very joyous place. 
[02:11:30]  Okay?  Everyone's been so nice.  And I'm going to leave now.  And I'll leave you with this thought.  Okay.  Every man has his tail of wool.  So, unfortunately, in life, there's more wool than tail.  Remember, if sex is a pain in the ass, you're doing it wrong.  Goodbye, everybody.  Thank you, Rodney.  I love you all.  Great.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Rodney Dangerfield will be at New Jersey Performing Arts Center on Sunday.  Tickets still available.  Not many.  Give them a call and get your tickets now. 
[02:12:00]  And Avery Fisher Hall, May 9th.  Okay?  Oh, we can give us some tickets to see Rodney?  How many?  Three.  All right.  We've got three pairs of tickets to see Rodney Dangerfield this Sunday at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.  Three random callers.  212-757-1027.  Rodney, this is a huge thrill for us.  All right.  No, I had a great, great time.  Okay.  Cool.  Rodney, thank you.  Thank you.  1027.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breath. 
[02:12:30]  Boom.  Wow.  WNEW.  Wow, look at the cameras going off.  Rodney Dangerfield still in the studio getting pictures taken.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Yes, iced coffee just got cool.  It's Planet Java, the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  Keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks.  They hit the streets and they're coming in an area near you with the cool new flavors.  Javadelic, Tremble, and Karamoca.  Javadelic's a grown-up milkshake.  It's a perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  And Karamoca's a chocolate caramel in a coffee. 
[02:13:00]  It's a dessert, it's a morning drink, it's a great mixer.  It's perfect.  All right.  There he goes, Rodney.  And, of course, Tremble.  You need an extra kick in your day.  121 milligrams of caffeine should do the trick.  And Tremble is the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  So students, truckers, moms, anyone who needs a boost is going to love this one.  Tremble does the trick deliciously.  Be yourself with Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude.  Available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java, say, hey, get some Planet Java. 
[02:13:30]  Iced coffee just got cool.  And it's called Planet Java.  Yes.  We're in the middle of a break, but Kimmy's here from Survivor.  Jeff's roaming around here.  We're going to talk to him in a little bit from Survivor.  You're doing the whipped cream bikini.  I'm doing the whipped cream bikini.  All these girls keep coming in and getting naked in my spot.  Isn't that amazing?  A lot of naked girls today.  We forgot all about that.  Any of those pictures up on www.aw.com?  No?  Okay.  All right, so stick around.  When we get back, we're going to get Kimmy from Survivor Naked.  Yeah, that's what's going to happen. 
[02:14:00]  You're awful.  So, stay there.  It's WNEW.  Hey, while you're listening to O&A, I'm out throwing chicken wings at people.  This is Jim Brewer.  Take that up, you stinker.  Thank you, Jim.  Hey.  It's the O&A Show.  It's the head of the darkness, man.  You know, believe it or not, there's tickets still available to see Jim Brewer at Caroline's, Anthony.  Brewer at Caroline's.  I think there are tickets available for tomorrow night's show, Thursday and Friday. 
[02:14:30]  And that's it.  And they're going fast.  No, Friday is sold out, actually.  I found out Friday is sold out.  So, you have to go down to Club Hall.  So, if you want to see Brewer at Caroline's, Thursday and Friday, tickets still available,  it looks like, for now.  But they're going to go fast.  I'm telling you, you're crazy not to see Brewer at Caroline's in a nice, small place.  Yes.  See Kimmy dancing around over here?  Yeah.  She's dancing.  Look.  Are you the girl that starts dancing on the bar when you tend the bar and stuff? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah?  Yes, I had a lot of fun with the bar.  Like that movie, Coyote Ugly.  Oh, you haven't seen Kimmy's boobs yet?  Could you flash Jim Norton?  She hasn't wowed me.  Oh, Norton.  What you missing?  You've got to hold up the wow sign.  Oh.  Her sticker.  There you go.  You've got to see how they are.  No, you are not.  I'm not.  Wait, did you just jump this curse?  You're right.  Don't get it down the hall. 
[02:15:30]  All right, hold on.  She goes, you're not taking pictures.  He goes, if I'm not.  All right, listen.  We've got to, like, reintroduce everyone.  First of all, Rodney Dangerfield killed for us, and we greatly appreciate that.  A legend.  We have Joey Paisano in the studio, Jim Norton, Jim Florentine.  We have our new friend Devin from Home Alone.  Hi, Tim.  Who played Buzz in Home Alone.  We've got Kimmy.  And now, Jeff asked me if I could get him a drink earlier.  He's like, hey, can I get a Coke around here or something? 
[02:16:00]  And then I looked at him like, uh, sure, I get.  He's like, wait, do you work here?  Don't you recognize him from Home Alone?  Jeff, this is what we do.  This is our stupid show.  I got you a Coke with some ice.  Is that okay, Jeff?  And look, we've got, like, three people from Survivor in the studio.  Mitchell has just arrived from Survivor.  Mitchell, how you been, man?  Wait, we've got to, like, get some more microphones in here.  Oh, absolutely.  So we've got Kimmy, Jeff, and Mitchell. 
[02:16:30]  Hey, Mitchell.  Look at that.  And Devin, nice to meet you.  You know Devin from Home Alone?  Of course.  I guess I'll have to stand so we can share.  He's a tall boy.  Let Mitchell sit and you can stand.  Yeah, that's actually probably be more easier to do it.  I swear to God, I've never felt like such a dwarf.  I'm always the big guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I know.  Well, Jeff thought I was the bouncer standing at the door.  I'm wearing all black.  I'm standing by the door with my arms folded.  Yeah, I'm just taking care of Rodney, you know?  Bouncer looks like one of the kids from Home Alone. 
[02:17:00]  You know, we've never talked to Jeff.  Jeff is the new one in this mix here.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  Huh?  What's going on?  You're overwhelmed by this damn radio show.  There's too many people.  I mean, we should tell people there's got to be 40 or 50 people roaming around.  And I don't even know what's going on outside the studio.  They're taking pictures for the whipped cream bikini contest.  A whole lot of nonsense.  There's a naked fat lady out there.  Yes.  And now there's one in here.  There she is.  She knows she's naked and she knows she's fat. 
[02:17:30]  She's the editor of Big Butt Magazine.  How would she not know?  Publisher.  Publisher, editor.  What's the difference?  You take your clothes off and show your ass and the issue.  Hey, Mendy.  Mendy, did you get your picture?  Mitchell didn't like that.  I don't blame you.  That's a tougher outback than they spent weeks in.  That's for sure.  Any of you guys want to try to survive that? 
[02:18:00]  I'm going to vote myself on that.  Right?  Vote yourself right off of that.  I'll do you vote me.  I think Jeff wants to canoodle with some of that.  Canoodle.  What is this canoodling?  She was canoodling.  I don't know.  Kimmy was caught canoodling in a...  Where was it?  At a magazine party with Jeff.  At a magazine party.  Is that an Australian term for snogging?  Are they canoodling right now in front of us? 
[02:18:30]  A little canoodle going on.  A little bit of a canoodle going on.  Is this a little canoodling?  You know what, Jeff?  I actually looked it up in the dictionary because I was thinking that was flirty.  And it said, caress softly while making love.  And I don't recall that.  At that time or ever?  Australian for making love.  Then.  When we were spies.  Are you two a little item here?  Is that what I'm getting from this?  We're two people here.  Right.  Jeff's not talking.  He ain't saying crap, man. 
[02:19:00]  About that.  That's good.  Hey, she's going to put on a whipped cream of candy, though.  I want to put it on her.  Is that cool?  Yeah.  What are we waiting for?  I know.  What the hell are we waiting for?  I keep getting bumped out.  Stripping her down an hour ago.  All these other girls showed up.  What's that?  I heard she's going to show her hogs.  That's why I came.  Show her hogs.  Mitchell.  Mitchell, you're going to reen it.  All right, Kimmy.  Yes.  You ready for this?  I'm ready.  You ready for the whipped cream?  Do you need another thing to loosen you up, maybe? 
[02:19:30]  No, I'm good.  You're good?  Look at her.  Her eyes are aglow.  Oh, that's the allergy medication from yesterday.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you want a pop or some Thorazine?  It's the allergy medication.  Where is Stinky and Rodney right now?  Hey, that's right.  Stinky and Rodney missing.  Uh-oh.  Smoking pot with Stinky.  Wonderful.  He wanted that Chicago green or something.  Yeah.  Chicago green.  Chicago.  What is that?  He's like the Pittsburgh turquoise.  He said Chicago green.  Stinky was like, oh, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Like he knows what it is.  Yeah.  Who's making up names?  He's a connoisseur.  Well, I'm going to go make myself into dessert now.  Now, give us a little idea.  How are you going to do this and where?  I'm going to cover it.  I have to cover up a lot.  I'm not going to be like, you know.  So we're not going to do it.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I thought we were going to see maybe some of the transformation, but.  Oh, yeah.  You guys are doing a great radio show.  And we'll be back.  As soon as you leave the studio, the 20 people you see in front of you are going to follow you. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  Oh, look.  The shirts.  Little light shirts.  Do we have microphones out there or what?  We're ready to go.  Break up some mics.  All right.  Because we're going out there.  Break some mics because we've got to get out there and watch this.  All right.  As Kimmy gets into her whipped cream bikini.  By the way, all the pictures.  I'll put you out.  All the pictures we took today will be up on WNEW.com.  Hey, you know what?  You guys just go ahead.  I'm just going to stay back here.  Yes, sure.  I'm just going to hang around here. 
[02:21:00]  Yes, sure.  Hey, we'll just have some Kimmy's going and we're all.  Hey, get the mic set up.  For God's sakes, hurry up.  Work quicker.  All right.  We're setting up microphones.  Hey, it's Wednesday, but let's play bit of the week.  You got one?  This one's live, right?  Oh, yeah.  That's live.  There you go.  You're thinking my mic?  Oh, yeah.  No one's going to be in the studio.  We're going out there to check out Kimmy.  We need the mobile mics.  Do we have headsets out there?  We don't need no stinking headset.  Not really?  All right.  Screw it. 
[02:21:30]  It's spontaneous.  Professional radio.  That's best.  You got that mic?  Is that one working, Jess?  Want to say hi?  Check one, two.  Whatever.  Anthony, can you hear me?  Check.  There you go.  Yes, Opie.  All right.  I'm heading out of the studio.  All right.  And Anthony's following.  I'll yell real loud until I get a mic.  All right, Anthony.  There we go.  I just saw Kimmy going into the No Crunch Zone bathroom.  The No Crunching Zone bathroom where she will be stripping down. 
[02:22:00]  And what the hell magazine is going on?  They're looking at, with all the beautiful women around here, why would you look at the  They're huddled around Big Butt.  The rest is in Big Butt magazine.  All right.  Madison, you like the Big Butt girls?  I'm very, very curious.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She's horrified. 
[02:22:30]  Well, the plastic is down.  There's some telltale signs that other girls have been on that plastic.  Either that or Norton was relieving himself with cream or DNA.  You decide.  Anthony, there's got to be like 30, 35 people out of the studio.  Yeah, it's pretty busy.  And the crowd is going to erupt when Kimmy comes out of the bathroom.  Now, did she go in with the whipped cream?  No.  No, because...  Come here, come here. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, she did.  Wait, wait, Jeff, Jeff.  All right, she did.  Yeah, what?  You're supposed to go in there and...  Where'd she go?  She's in the bathroom.  She's in the bathroom.  Jeff's not happy.  He was supposed to apply.  I know.  The whipped cream.  They're screaming.  Jeff just locked in.  Rick, what'd you say?  Come here, Rick.  Come here.  You son of a bitch.  What'd you see when that door flung open?  I saw...  How to put it this delicately?  In Anhill?  Not enough white stuff. 
[02:23:30]  I just saw...  I just saw what you guys saw earlier.  And then, of course, there was nothing on the bottom part either.  Did you see actual hairstyle?  I saw the outback.  Oh, the butt.  Wait, Jeff's got a report.  Jeff, you all right?  She's doing it in there.  She's doing it in there.  She's doing it in there.  Jeff is going into the...  Into the bathroom.  It's dripping, yeah.  With whipped cream.  Keep taking it on.  Okay.  You know, we are so stupid.  We are so effing stupid. 
[02:24:00]  Super soaker.  Super soaker.  If we would have had a super soaker, when she walks out, we could have just sprayed the  whipped cream right off of her.  We did turn up the heat.  God, do we...  Look at Stinky go running.  Uh-oh.  Tell me we have a super soaker in the back office.  I think we have one hidden soaker.  If he comes back...  Yeah, but is the thing on in there?  Son of a bitch.  Oh, she's now screaming because she just heard us.  Yeah, the delay.  The delay just kicked in.  But thank God we don't have one. 
[02:24:30]  What?  Thank God we don't have one.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, fill them up.  Yeah, she's going to stand by while we go squirt, squirt, squirt.  I'm talking a fire hose we need.  We need a fire hose, Stinky.  What's going on?  We're patiently waiting here.  Fill up in the bathroom.  I think they...  They're screaming.  I think they need a fire can.  Oh, I hear...  And there's screaming going on in there.  Listen to that. 
[02:25:00]  What happened?  What do you mean?  What do you mean, Jeff?  She can't get it perfectly ready.  It keeps dripping off.  Well, get it perfectly ready.  Yeah, she's kind of got to be laying down to do this.  She can't move.  It'll fall off.  Yeah, tell her to come out here, cover it up, and then, I don't know, we'll figure something  out.  Oh, brother.  Hey, Kimmy, this is just insane.  Look at Rick is looking in now.  Rick is looking in the goddamn bathroom.  Hey, Mitchell.  Is this the first time seeing Kimmy naked? 
[02:25:30]  Rick.  It is.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She's coming out.  She's coming out.  She's coming out.  All right.  Here comes Kimmy.  She's coming out.  All right.  Here comes Kimmy.  Come on, Kimmy.  Come on, Kimmy.  You just got to lay...  You just got to lay down.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Kimmy's completely naked.  Nice.  Rock.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  All right.  Lay down, Kimmy.  Lay down.  Wait a minute.  Lay down.  Lay down.  Oh, my God.  Holy cow.  Kimmy's completely naked.  Now...  This is insane. 
[02:26:00]  Now, I got that.  No cameras.  No cameras.  No cameras.  No cameras.  I must say, that's...  Wow.  That's quite a...  Kimmy, very nice.  Look at that.  Really frothing on the whipped cream.  Really melting fast.  It is melting fast.  Well...  You're hot?  Yes, you're very hot.  Very nice.  You want some chocolate syrup or sprinkles on there or what? 
[02:26:30]  All right.  We're making some sprinkles.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  All right.  Jeff from Survivor is hanging out with Kimmy.  Kimmy is in her whipped cream bikini.  Bravo.  Am I in this cover?  Yeah, I think they are.  Wait, let...  That rocks.  There you go.  All right.  Kimmy, pose for us.  You're spraying the water. 
[02:27:00]  Wow, you're a good shot.  So is she.  Oh, my God.  Look at Norton.  Norton had a great view of the Outback.  She's a bravo Kimmy.  There she goes.  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Yay! 
[02:27:30]  Oh, my God.  And there you have a visual of what it looks like when you leave Norton's apartment.  Yeah, I know.  Actually, she threw whipped cream all over the place.  It's on the walls.  Wait, she just invited Norton to go in the bathroom and help her wash...  What?  Norton's going to help you clean up?  Are you insane?  Look at Norton.  See the look?  Yes.  She'll invite John Wayne Gacy to a kid's party.  What the hell are you doing in there? 
[02:28:00]  The look Norton game was classic.  Wow.  Oh, that's gold in that camera, my friend.  I think you guys could have held off a bit longer on the website of the Super Show.  No, I sensed she was ready to just...  She was done.  Yeah, so I thought it was time to start squirting her with the water cunts.  Did you see?  She started freaking out because it was running right off her boob.  The whole mass of whipped cream.  And then she grabbed her crotch trying to keep that...  Oh, my God, I'm a mess.  I got whipped cream all over me. 
[02:28:30]  You look like you spent the night in Norton's.  I have, and I did look like...  All right, I think we should take a break.  Yeah.  Let's take a little breather.  We got the Jimmy!  All right, we'll be back.  It's WNW.  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Ladies, come down to WNEW anytime between 3 and 7  for your chance to win the grand prize trip to Hawaii.

Instead of, instead of, uh...  The death of...  No, the sprinkles make...  I'm just thinking...  Oh, my...  The sprinkles make it difficult.  Am I assuming the proper whipped cream removal position? 
[02:29:30]  Jesus Christ.  The sprinkles make it tough.  You don't know how happy I am to know Opie and Anthony right now.  It's amazing.  And she's getting sprinkles taken off her and clear stuff leaked on her.  Here's Rodney and now this.  Is that a deflated balloon going on?  Oh, my God.  I get more towels.  We're getting more towels.  They're cleaning Kimmy off.  We're listening in, obviously. 
[02:30:00]  My jacket needs a hose.  We'll get your jacket.  We need more towels.  Nice guy I am.  Norton's hose needs a jacket.  You are being a total gentleman.  Do you know how difficult it is?  I don't know.  She's completely naked.  I know.  Completely.  Thank you.  Jim.  Can Jim hear us at all?  No.  No?  No.  Okay. 
[02:30:30]  She thinks that the...  There's a new line of beauty powder.  Yeah.  All the sales guys are around the...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're going to dump out of that.  He's cursing.  He's cursing.  Because that effing stuff is like glue.  I don't know if he's talking about the whipped cream or him.  Is that good?  What am I doing?  Where?  There's a sprinkle on my what?  Is that my lady?  It's done?  Turn around.  I'll tell you. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Can we wait one more down and just wipe everything off so there's no worse cream smell?  Um, yes.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  This isn't the salsa of this car wash thing.  Oh, my God.  He's gone by you.  You know he's wiping her down right now. 
[02:31:30]  He's wiping her butt is what he's doing.  Okay.  He's cleaning out intimate areas.  Okay.  I'll wait one more sprinkles on my leg.  This is very nice.  You're on my underneath.  You still have some?  Some.  Um, okay.  No, he's such a liar.  I'll go there.  Isn't he?  He'll say she has some and she'll be squeaky clean.  All better?  Yes.  Oh, my God. 
[02:32:00]  Where is there a hole?  Not the one in your pants.  I knew that was coming.  Oh, my God.  Okay, right there again.  Yes.  Right there again.  There's one right there.  Nine.  Holy Jesus.  Do they know?  Okay.  No, they don't know.  They really don't.  Swear.  They can't hear it.  Okay.  All right.  No idea. 
[02:32:30]  There we go.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Well, but you have to hold my, well, I'll hold my panties open.  That'll help.  I only, I put on a matching.  Do you have any help so you don't use my hand?  Okay.  See?  Okay, hang on.  Let me hold on to you.  That's it.  I'm shaving my head.  Okay.  Is Norton holding her panties open so she can step into it?  No, unfortunately, he wasn't.  Oh, okay.  Oh, hi, Jim.  Wow, they finally turned the monitor up.  What idiots, why did they turn the monitor up in there?  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:00]  I never put one on before.  You guys get me a hammer and she screams I can take it off.  Too good.  I'm just fixing it.  Okay, now you've got to let them go into it.  Are they in?  Rick, what's going on?  What?  Um, whichever one.  The door's wide open.  Nice.  It's my favorite.  The door's wide open now, eh?  Okay.  The cat's out of the bag. 
[02:33:30]  This is unlike any survivor interview.  Get on another show.  Get someone else for the jacket.  Oh, look.  I need a jismopper for the floor.  Jismopper.  Your feet.  Put your feet under the sink.  Okay.  Can you turn it on?  Okay.  Oh, that's so much better.  Why don't we do it to begin with?  What is she doing?  Dad, go find out what she's doing.  Washing her feet.  Everyone else is watching.  Okay.  Door's wide open. 
[02:34:00]  There goes Devin.  Put up over here.  Norton cursed again.  He's saying the S word.  All right, Ben.  Ben just took a peek.  Ben, get over there.  That's Mike.  Where?  One of her legs is up on the sink,  and Norton's now washing her legs.  She's completely naked.  Okay, we're good?  Norton hasn't washed his car in four years.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  You have to help me with my pants next. 
[02:34:30]  I'll help you.  I'll help.  He's Mr. Helpful Hand today.  He's Mr. Nicey Nice.  That was the line.  There's a line to check out the view, Ann.  Literally, I'm not kidding.  Are you kidding me?  There's like seven people online,  because the door is only ajar,  like about, I don't know, six to eight inches.  A lot of people saying they're shaving their head now.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, to rub the head.  This is a loser I am.  I got a hot girl, and she's putting her clothes on. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, we lost the mic.  We lost the mic.  We lost the feed.  We lost the feed.  Jesse, there's a problem only you can solve.  We lost the mic, Rick.  We lost the mic.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Yes, Sam's great.  Drink it.  I have my clothes now.  All right, is she out of the, uh...  Thank you.  Bravo.  There's Kimmy. 
[02:35:30]  She's out of the bathroom.  She's in a bra, and she's got her pants on.  After this break, we've got to get the Norton report.  Anthony, just hold it.  Hold every emotion you're feeling.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Until after the break.  After the break.  Hold on.  Look at this.  Hold on.  She's in her bra.  Anthony, simple as this.  If you just enjoyed the last 15 to 20 minutes of radio,  do us a favor and get yourself a Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  We love it.  We drink it all the time.  And, of course, Sam Adams' exclusive sponsor of Project Greenlight. 
[02:36:00]  It's a joint, uh, effort joint.  Between Project Greenlight, Miramax Films, and HBO,  the winner of the contest gets to direct his movie,  which will be distributed by Miramax Films.  Chris Moore, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck  are the executive producers of the film.  The winner is a guy from Chicago named Pete Jones.  He used to sell insurance.  Now he's in the movie biz.

[02:36:30]  We love it.  If you go to the bar, get, uh, Sam Adams.  If you go to the store for some beers for the house on the weekend,  Sam Adams.  They got the summer ale out now, and that's really great.  Or the lager.  Sam Adams.  This segment of Opie and Anthony is brought to you by The Home Depot.  First in home improvement.  Dig the Chick.  The Radio Chick.  Weekdays, 9 to noon.  Taxes and surges.  The world's universal language.  I use my breath to get other people's attention.  Ripple out Wednesday!  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:37:00]  The brain is in their hands.  1-8-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the O&A show.  We're missing so much.  There's so much going on.  Anthony, it's time to crash your website.  Yeah, yeah, here it is.  This is called Crash Your Website, a new game on the O&A show.  I hope you all got your instant feedbacks in.  I hope, uh, you, uh, emailed whoever you wanted to at the station here.  Because not only will this, uh, whole site crash, N-E-W.com, but all of the CBS-owned websites will now go down. 
[02:37:30]  And this is the reason we've been talking about the cable modems from out the motor line for the last six months.  For this reason right here.  You're going to need a good connection to get in quick because here it comes, people.  Kimmy in her whipped cream bikini pictures up on W-N-E-W.com right now.  Go to the Opie and Anthony, uh, page, and you will see Kimmy pretty much naked. 
[02:38:00]  Except for a little whipped cream that is spread about her, luscious boobs and, um, lap area.  And sprinkles, yes!  And Jeff's in the picture, too.  So if you're a Jeff fan, it's even better.  But, uh, Kimmy, yeah, and I was just looking at the pictures,  because I know we're not going to be able to punch them up for about six weeks now.  Uh, very good.  I would say you are right now in the lead. 
[02:38:30]  Would you say that, Opie?  I would.  Bravo.  Absolutely.  I would.  Look at that.  We got a lot of...  Look at this.  We got a lot of girls up there that, uh, got their pictures taken today.  That's bravo.  Oh, and I just want to tell my mom I did not lick the whipped cream off of it.  Your mom is listening, David.  She is, I know.  I told her I was going to the gym.  I told her I wasn't going to go on the show again.  She's like, don't go on that show.  They don't, they're so nasty.  That's funny.  She doesn't mind you taking a little boy into the court authority.  She mentioned nothing about that. 
[02:39:00]  Don't touch the survivor, girl.  She mentioned nothing about the three-bag special.  Hey, check this out.  Doughboy, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Uh, it's done.  Yeah, it's done.  I just got you with, uh, her.  Opie, I just tried on another browser to get to the, uh, N.E.W. site.  Yeah.  The page cannot be displayed.  It's over, Johnny.  I'm three, and this sucker's cooked.  This is the first time I've seen a computer start smoking.  It's just over.  My moms are smoking.  I don't know about that.  And now I can't even get on another website. 
[02:39:30]  Like, this computer, it's done.  It's done.  We just stopped business.  That's it.  It's over.  The whole CBS network on the internet is spent.  Spent.  How proud do you feel right now, Kimmy?  Paiseless.  I crashed the computer and ruined a pair of my boxers.  Norton.  How much do you owe us?  A lot.  Okay.  A lot.  Yeah, Norton.  You were in the bathroom with Kimmy, washing her.  Mm-hmm.  What was that like? 
[02:40:00]  Nice.  Yes.  Yeah.  How do you, what do you, yeah.  I just want, she's standing right next to him.  What do you want him to say?  I just want to hear, because I heard things like, oh, there's a sprinkle.  Now, where was it?  The truth, where the actual inner thigh meets the torso.  Yeah.  In the front and on the ass in the back, and I had to get them, because.  How'd they taste good?  Because they were, because they were bad sprinkles.  Very naughty.  Naughty sprinkles.  Naughty sprinkles.  I trained them. 
[02:40:30]  That's great.  It was nice, though.  I was not.  Yeah.  And then, what did you have to do?  I heard, hold my panties open.  What was that about?  That was about just holding her panties open, so she could put her feet in them.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  So now, at this point, she had no panties on.  Yeah.  You're kneeling in front of her.  Behind her, too.  And I got to rub his head.  But it's like.  I got to rub his head.  It's like an alcoholic going to the liquor store.  Yeah.  You're kneeling right in front of Ground Zero.  Norton, what went through your head when Kimmy goes, can you come in the bathroom and help me? 
[02:41:00]  Prison.  Which is what I was going to say.  It looked like a scene out of the Oz weight room with those two were doing in there.  He was behind her.  She was.  Man.  And you got to wash the whipped cream off of her.  Ben, what's wrong?  Now, her butt, she might have had a tough time reaching her butt.  Did you?  Yes, I did.  And it was out of being a gentleman and because Opie and Anthony asked me to do something and  I'm a team player.  And you are.  God bless you.  Do you realize if my father had been laying dead in the bathroom, I would have stood on 
[02:41:30]  him and put her in the bathroom.  Wait, Ben just got back from taking a look at the bathroom.  Looks like a crime scene.  It was a crime scene.  No one was involved.  That's the clear stuff coming from Morton.  All right, let's go to George.  George, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned today that Morton is a true survivor.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  That was a good gig, though, man.  He's the best and you guys are, too, man.  Have a good one.  That was the best gig ever.  Yeah, it really was.  I thought the garden was good, but that just blew it away. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Of course.  This guy, Tiller from North Bergen, says, I'm going to shoot myself now.  I never wanted to find myself praying I was Norton.  Psycho Mark.  Dude, I logged right on.  I can see it right here at Fox in full color.  She's got a huge mouth.  That is not news to anyone.  Yeah, you just have to watch the show to see that.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, that second picture, man.  You are laughing.  Let me see the second picture because we got the pictures up just before the website crashed. 
[02:42:30]  Nice.  Talk about taking a baby's arm clutching an apple.  All right, Mackie.  All right.  Go Sox, jackass.  So Kimmy's up on WNAW.com.  Yeah.  Good luck trying to get there.  You'll see it, I don't know, later tonight, possibly.  Oscar.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  I wanted to know if the NYPD can use that tape in case anything ever happens.  Yeah, there's a lot going on with these pictures.  Yeah, and today I learned that every baseball team has a goop now. 
[02:43:00]  Later, guys.  Right, bye.  Well, what did we learn?  I learned ONA of the Robert Downey Jr. is a radio.  Yes, we are.  We can't leave anything alone.  If it's dangled in front, boy, you have some willpower.  It's a great day for me.  I get to hang with one of my idols, Rodney, the great Rodney, and then, you know, forget  about him immediately.  He wouldn't clean her ass.  Thank God I get it and confuse the two.  Hey, Morton, what are you doing with my ass? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, I would have, too.  I would have definitely wiped Rodney down.  I was down.  Hey, huh?  I like it.  Night show appearances.  Hey, Gary, you forgot a sprinkle.  Okay?  All right.  Eddie.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Great show.  It touched me there.  What's up, Eddie?  What I learned today?  Yeah.  It's easier to take sprinkles off than body glitter.  Yes.  Take it easy.  Great show.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:44:00]  Mitchell, what did you think?  Yeah, that's nice.  You like that?  Yeah, I saw the pictures.  That's hilarious.  Did you see anything like that when you were on Australia?  What's that?  When you were in Australia, did you see anything like that?  No, she wasn't on my tribe, so I didn't get to see her.  I know it.  You did.  What the hell was going on with you two during the show?  Was there canoodling at least?  No canoodling.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I mean...  We slept next to each other the first night, and that was it.  You did, did you?  Yeah.  I farted on her. 
[02:44:30]  Yes, that's right.  You did?  Yes.  Yeah.  She told me that.  Show me all kinds of love.  Farted on her.  Nice.  Whispering me.  Hey, baby.  You know, you put in some time with her on Australia.  You go through some tough times, and there's Norton, a degenerate, wiping her down.  Well, that's because Jeff's the one that got me dirty.  Yeah.  See, there you go.  You didn't tell that part.  That's so...  Tag team.  Amazing. 
[02:45:00]  Jesus.  Pretty much.  You've got to love it.  Kimmy is the best survivor.  I've got to say it.  Wow.  I've got to tell you, the hiney, I wanted to just cry.  It was so nice.  Rodney now, or...  Oh, okay.  Because you were saying you were thrilled at Rodney.  It was amazing.  You look very moved right now.  It was a work of art.  It really was.  Look at him.  He is.  I can't believe him.  I really...  You look like you're all stoked up.  I didn't want to talk to anybody when Rick came in. 
[02:45:30]  I was like, get out of here!  Yeah, there was a room full of C-blockers out there.  No, that was actually...  They probably saved me from a lot of legal problems.  Yeah, I can picture you in the bathroom.  She's bent over the sink.  You're cleaning her off.  And you're like, okay, fine.  No, but I wasn't okay, fine.  I was being a nice guy because I like him and she's nice.  And, you know, I can't be a jerk to her and decide if I do that, she'll never bang me.  So I have to...  Yes, you will. 
[02:46:00]  Yes, you will.  Wow.  What a day.  It's like making Ted Bundy a professor at a college.  It doesn't make sense.  There's a girl out there right now riding around, and for $40, she is really going to earn it.  She has no idea.  Oh, my God.  More, more, more.  My name's Trudy.  Why do you keep calling me Kimmy? 
[02:46:30]  I'm finishing.  You're Kimmy.  You're not going to survive this.  No, Daddy, get them sprinkles out of my hair.  What's with the sprinkles?  You was in a movie.  Another 24-hour callback.  I love it.  It's a rehash.  My God.  What a day on this program.  Oh, without a doubt.  How the hell are we going to top these shows?  I'm winded.  I know you can top it. 
[02:47:00]  I'm winded.  Friday, go to Club Chrome.  7-3-2-7-2-7-3-3-0.  Very nice.  Well, very subtle.  I guess we could, like, play a little What Did We Learn, Anthony?  There was so much today.  Oh, yeah.  You want to do that?  This is an educational show.  All right.  Let's see what's going on on the phones.  Andy, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just want to tell you.  I just checked out those pictures of Kimmy.  Yeah.  It was a hot little piece.  Yes.  So, no, I learned two things.  I learned that all girls should take it like champs. 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  And the second one, which was classic, is that Mendy works in prison to cure sex offenders.  Yes.  That's a great line.  That was a great line from Rodney Dangerfield.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Yo, great job.  All right.  There you go.  Everyone, check it out.  Kimmy's Whipped Cream Bikini on WNAW.com.  But what's your name?  I forgot your name because there's so much.  Get on mic.  Celia Silva.  Celia Silva.  She's getting rave reviews on her pictures as well.  And you want to plug that bikini website again?  Bikiniqueen.com.  Bikiniqueen.com, right? 
[02:48:00]  Actually, yes.  I'd have to say big up.  Big up.  Big up.  After you're done with Kimmy, you move on to Celia.  I picked the whipped cream, but she didn't let me.  I forgot that you were out there.  I'm sorry.  I mean, it's just crazy.  Wait, but Kimmy, Kimmy, we still have 15 minutes left in the show.  Oh, we still have a can of whipped cream in there.  God bless you.  God bless you.  God bless you.  Lesbian couch.  Lesbian couch.  Yeah.  Lesbian couch for 15 minutes only.  Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.  All it takes. 
[02:48:30]  And like I said, that's two times for every guy in this room.  15 minutes.  Please.  If I could reload quick, it'd be three.  If someone gave me a hummer right now, do you ever see Full Metal Jack and how his head  came off and he got himself?  Hey, Joker.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I learned two things today.  Yeah.  One, I should have spent more time painting those your studio doors today.  And two, Jim Norton got to be the luckiest man on the face of the earth. 
[02:49:00]  I am, man.  Wait, you were the painter today?  Yeah, I came and painted your doors today.  And I'll do anything to play softball with you guys.  Anything you can name, I'll do.  You went home early today.  Yeah, well, you know, the boss called me back to the office.  I try to meet you guys, but you guys want to set this on, you know.  Yeah, right on.  All right, Jimmy.  You don't need to worry about the bathroom.  I painted that already.  Eggshell white.  White wants the fence.  Hey, Jimmy.  Eggshell white.  Jimmy, you're playing softball with us? 
[02:49:30]  Celebrity softball game?  Yeah.  We don't know the day.  Yeah, as soon as there's an open date, absolutely.  All right, nice.  Clear my schedule for you guys.  You're going to be a star.  And I don't want to put Jeff and Mitchell on the spot, but you guys are definitely invited.  But you guys, open invite to the softball game, which is like 8,000 lunatics.  8,000 people is real softball.  I might need like a bat boy or someone to probably ask.  I'm sure Norton will be a bat boy.  You might need a wiffle ball bat boy.  Grab this one.  It doesn't come off. 
[02:50:00]  Nice.  You know how sad this is?  Are you going to tell me?  No, listen to this.  Listen to this.  Mendy from Big Butt Magazine is getting her whipped cream bikini done.  No one's outside.  No one's outside.  Because no one can fit.  I'll go out.  I'll go.  Someone's outside.  Make sure Zebra finishing after Zeppelin played.  That's pretty much what you're going to be getting.  How many people are going to be sitting in the same seat for Zebra?  And if you...  Could you get the whipped cream off? 
[02:50:30]  They will just send a couple of cops in there.  You're never going to ride the front of the bus, boy.  Fire hose.  Yeah, who wants to get the whipped cream off of Mendy?  I never saw him run so fast.  Ran for the door like a fire at a social club.  Can you get those sprinkles over there?  Where?  There are about 40 of them.  What are you talking about?  Let's go to Eric here.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  How are you? 
[02:51:00]  All right.  I learned to rub the whipped cream on the skin or else I get to hold it.  Right on, Eric.  Thank you.  Later, Will.  All right.  Let's go to Anthony on the phone.  Anthony.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned the dump machine's got to be set for 60 seconds now.  Why?  Why?  Ask Rodney.  Oh, really?  Rodney was getting rambunctious with the F word.  I think he's the new champ of dump time.  He beat George out.  Yeah, a few things might have got through today.  Whoops.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Later, boys.  Bye.  Steven Lynch popped in for a little while. 
[02:51:30]  Steve, did you hear my brother's country version of your tune?  Yeah.  You did?  That was probably the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Very good.  I can say without a trace of sarcasm.  I have not heard of it.  Wasn't it like...  I am completely honored and touched by that.  I thought it was a great cover, a country cover of Special Olympics.  I thought it was just going to sound like the song, except with a little steel guitar in it.  He's got the steel guitar, the fiddle thing going on.  I don't know what the hell's happening.  Very good.  We'll play it again.  Yeah, cool.  You know the Special Olympics tune, obviously. 
[02:52:00]  Who doesn't?  Yeah, great.  All right.  We're going to play...  Well, we'll find it in a second here.  I have not heard it.  I'm excited about that.  Yeah.  We'll get it on.  He did a great job.  We'll get it on in a couple seconds here.  Eric, what's up?  Look at Dorton.  He's looking at me and making faces.  Kimmy's right there.  He kind of ducks behind her a little so Kimmy can see.  And he's going, don't the best half in the ass.  And you totally just busted him.  I don't care.  You can see that.  I just can't see it on the...  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Right.  Hey, Eric, what's up? 
[02:52:30]  What's going on?  I learned that yesterday we had a warm ripple.  You had a warm ripple yesterday.  A weather ripple, actually.  It wasn't a heat wave.  Did Jay Moore narrate that Dale Earnhardt thing?  I think so, yes.  Yeah, because it sounded like him.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Peace.  Thank you.  Into the wall.  That guy sounded stoned.  All right, here's a brother...  Jay Moore narrated...  Here's Brother Joe doing...  It's going fast.  It was crazy.  Doing the...  Doing the...  That's good.  That is good.  Brother Joe doing Stephen Lynch's Special Olympics song. 
[02:53:00]  The country version.  The country version.  Yes.  We'll play it again here.  Watch them run.  Watch them crawl.  Watch them try to catch their ball.  Olympics.  Yeah, them special Olympics. 
[02:53:30]  Watch them laugh.  Watch them groove.  Watch them fall into the pool.  Oh, that's a-divin'.  That's them special Olympics.  Oh, that's a-divin'.  And I know...  And I know...  I know for well... 
[02:54:00]  That I will burn in hell.  The guys playing that wheelchair basketball got me about the funniest worrying thing I've ever seen in my life.  In my life.  At them special Olympics. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, that's a-divin'.  Oh, that's a-divin'.  At them special Olympics.  Oh, that's a-divin'.  Yeah.  Great job by Joe.  Brother Joe.  Steven's, like, flattered.  It's amazing.  Yeah, I didn't think the song...  You know...  I was wondering how he was going to do it.  Yeah.  How he was going to take a sweet song about Mongoloid children...  ...and make it funny...  ...instead of just cruel like my version is.  And now it's funny and cruel at the same time. 
[02:55:00]  The truth is that that's the only version you're going to play from now on?  It is.  That's it.  The country version.  I'm bringing a whole band with me from now on.  Steel string, bass, jug, and some of the washboard, and...  Sure.  Well, good job by Joe.  Yes.  That's so funny.  Hey, Pete, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  Learned a couple things today.  Okay.  I learned that Al Gore started the internet and Kimmy stopped it.  And I also learned that Rodney thought ladybugs would be the next Gone with the Wind.  All right, Pete, good job. 
[02:55:30]  Smoke that Chicago green, you know.  We should say it again.  Yeah, Kimmy's whipped cream bikini pictures are up on WNAW.com.  Good luck getting there.  Watch it crash again.  This will be fun.  Rick from Jersey.  Today I learned that the population in Newark never changes because every time a kid is  born, a guy leaves town.  Can I make some...  I want to mention, too, I went out and saw Mendy in the whipped cream crime scene photos  during the Simpson trial.  Oh, so did I. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, is that...  The bikini covers more than her panties did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  Can we not talk about this anymore?  Imagine that poor can of whipped cream is sitting there going, oh, Kimmy's coming over here.  Who's she going to pick?  Us?  Or the can next to me?  And you take that can and he's all happy.  And then the other can goes, oh, maybe another girl will come in.  And then it gets grabbed by the big, meaty paw of Mendy. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  Who then uses that whipped cream.  Anthony, good news.  Yes.  Kimmy's whipped cream bikini pictures are now on foundrymusic.com as well.  Nice.  And I'm sure they're on Opie Anthony.  Spreading like AIDS in Haiti.  Great.  Do I want to send it to my parents?  Website.  AIDS in Haiti.  I'm going to enjoy that for a second.  Thank you.  I was inspired by you.  No, I know it's with the Haiti AIDS.  Website.  Website's picking up the pictures. 
[02:57:00]  Yes.  Great.  Spreading like...  Tabloid, star, inquirer.  Big guy.  I would not be surprised, let's say.  It wouldn't shock me if they did turn up somewhere else.  You know what?  I'm covered.  It's so bad.  I'm covered.  I'm covered.  Let me tell you, you're covered more than most people on the beach.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially because they had a Robert Moses Field 5 and that's naked.  So this covers definitely more than the beach.  And like the internet, all of a sudden there's a traffic jam getting into Field 5 right now. 
[02:57:30]  What girls?  Keep that in mind.  Robert Moses.  Field 5.  Like, oh.  But we've got a house running around.  Kimmy!  Kimmy!  Kimmy, I'm here.  Please, where are you?  I'm here in Field 5.  Oh, my goodness.  It's already 10 to 7.  I find Al's coming in to see me and I'm running late.  Look at this.  Al's coming in.  Al?  Yeah, look at that.  All right.  We'll wrap up the show.  Oh, yeah.  We're still here.  I forgot about him.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  How's it going, guys?  What's up?  Love that old gag. 
[02:58:00]  Hey, good.  All right.  I learned four quick things from Norton today.  All right.  I learned he paints.  Hasn't washed his car in four years.  Uh-huh.  And that the balloon act tastes like a mushroom in a can.  And that we should throw spears at Mindy's butt.  Nice day.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Professor Norton, we should get out of here.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a great day for radio.  We had a lot of fun today.  Better day for Norton, though.  Please.  Got to thank everybody.  Oh, my God. 
[02:58:30]  Well, thank you for letting me come out and play.  Oh, come on.  It's coming right far.  Mindy just walked in completely butt-ass naked.  Hey, guys.  How's that going?  How's that going?  Wow.  That is something.  You look like the prop from Cliffhanger.  Oh, my God.  Mindy, that is some ass. 
[02:59:00]  I've got to tell you.  How can you tell it?  I'm, like, so sticky right now.  Ordered us things.  Ordered us things.  It's chocolate and whipped cream.  Oh, my God.  I've got, like, chocolate.  You know what?  You're a bit too low.  I can't.  One blow me a head.  It's wet.  You know what?  Yeah.  There's no way to end the show, so I'm just going to hit commercial.  Sweet, miserable crap.  I have to say a special hello to someone. 
[02:59:30]  Be quiet.  I don't know who you are.  Hi, sweetie.  Ugh.  The guy that works at KFC?  Ben and Jerry.  Ben and Jerry.  We were both going to the same place.  What's up?  This is Hennessy.  She's competitor number six.  Hey, we remember Hennessy from Privilege.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  We're having our big Easter gala tomorrow.  Easter.  23rd and 11th.  Yeah.  You know, Easter gala.  At Privilege. 
[03:00:00]  That's just what Christ wanted.  Can you wow us?  Nice, nice.  Excellent.  The Easter gala.  Woo!  Nice.  They're going to vote on the hottest dancer and then crucifier.  I was resurrected.  Now I'm erected.  Easter gala.  Privilege.  We're on 23rd and 11th across from the Chelsea Piers.  Great place.  We go there all the time.  What else do they celebrate?  Ass Wednesday?  Oh, yeah.  Nice. 
[03:00:30]  Actually, we've got a great cigar selection of in-case talking about ashes.  There you go.  Who's your friend?  That's Madison.  Madison.  Oh, hi, Madison.  Hi, Madison.  She's up there on the contestant website at WNEW.com.  She did the whipped cream thing.  Looking great.  Good job, Madison.  Thank you.  And now Mendy's picture is going to be up there.  I've got chocolate.  Yeah, I was out there.  That ain't chocolate.  When you put those pictures on, the computer's going to crash itself.  Turn it off.  Madison.  Madison, did you wow us already? 
[03:01:00]  No, I didn't wow us.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Hey, do you know?  He was in Home Alone.  That's the Home Alone guy.  Oh, that's you?  That's me.  What's that, dude?  How are you?  Macaulay Culkin.  Yeah, Macaulay Culkin.  Look what you did, you little jerk.  It's Joe Pesci.  If I had cast that film, it would have been a whole new ballgame.  I bet it would have been.  Kevin, you're such a disease.  All right, we've got to get out of here. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, it is getting late.  I hope you guys enjoyed the show today.  Thank everybody for coming down.  I'd like to thank you guys.  Kevin, again.  Thank you very much.

I had a test on my nose.  Isn't it so funny how Kimmy can blow her nose and everyone's like, oh, that's cute.  And Mendy comes in completely naked and everyone's like, oh.  I know.  Kimmy blows her nose.  It's adorable.  You have a stroke on the carpet.  We're like, don't sweat on the rug.  We've got to go, man.  It's very nice.  I'm going to get a forklift.  Of course.

Hey, let me tell you.  That Lucille Ball thing didn't make him happy.  What?  He's in good company.  I was trying to give it a positive spin.  Did he basically tell us that his A-word is going to explode any day?  He said it could happen at any moment.  I'm waiting for you.

I heard they hated each other's guts.  Who wouldn't?  Hey, we, did you go on that tour in L.A. where we found, where we got to see the spot where  Fred dropped dead of a massive heart attack?  On a death tour.  Did you ever take the death tour in L.A.?  It's one of the best things you could ever do.  It's a modified hearse.
