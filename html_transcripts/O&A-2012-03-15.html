<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a brief, unexplained interruption possibly involving one of the hosts suffering a medical episode.  After a commercial break featuring ads for SiriusXM, Paul Frederick shirts, Ashley Madison, Identity Guard, Barracuda Networks, Gamefly, Retro Fitness, and Grasshopper,  Jim Norton recounted a bizarre dream involving Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, a figure called E-Rock, a blurry photograph, a flooded backyard, a transvestite, and a surreal cab ride to the suburbs. The hosts speculated on the dream's meaning, connecting it to Norton's anxieties about memory and relationships.  The conversation then shifted to high gas prices, leading to a humorous digression about political podiums, including a discussion of online podium retailers and a call from someone who rents them out for political events.

The show then featured a discussion about a sexually suggestive deposition transcript of Jeffrey Epstein, using highly offensive language to describe the situation.  This was followed by a brief discussion of Anthony Cumia's potential illness and humorous banter about stomach viruses.  Next, Rich Voss and his wife Bonnie were in studio guests.  Their conversation centered on their tumultuous relationship, detailed in their podcast "My Wife Hates Me," which they both disliked. Topics included Rich's stand-up career, their financial struggles, home renovation issues, their differing approaches to chores, details of their sex life, and a family crisis involving Rich's brother's diabetic coma and subsequent leg amputation.  The segment included a humorous "Jewish Intervention" bit about Rich's frugality, and promotional plugs for their upcoming shows.

Following this, a comedian guest appeared, complaining about the inauthenticity of some radio personalities and the unsatisfying nature of morning television, contrasting it with positive experiences in Florida and Connecticut, and his time on "Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn." He shared negative experiences with Byron Allen, discussing censorship, the influence of advertisers, and the reactions to controversial figures like Rush Limbaugh. The conversation included strong criticisms of political correctness, cancel culture, numerous offensive remarks about various groups, and a discussion about gay marriage interspersed with homophobic comments. The segment also included anecdotes about audience interactions and a sexually suggestive bit, concluding with plugs for the comedianâ€™s upcoming shows and CD.

A significant portion of the show focused on an internal staff conflict between Paul (phone screener) and Troy.  Troy publicly criticized Paul's work ethic, leading to a confrontation and songs written and performed by Roland (another staff member) during commercial breaks, containing explicit insults aimed at Paul's laziness and Post-it note usage.  The hosts and other staff members, including Sal (the intern), discussed the events, with varied reactions.  A caller, Marcos, mentioned online hate from listeners, and Kenny discussed a rumor he created about Sam and Troy hosting a new show. The conflict included discussion about Roland's clothing choices and his relationships with other staff members;  his tight shorts were revealed to be worn in honor of Rich Davis from another show.

The main show segments also included Jim Norton's furious rant about Time Warner Cable's poor service, culminating in him ordering a Slingbox to stream his Fios service and canceling Time Warner.  Anthony Cumia discussed his annoyance with an aggressive street performer panhandling near him, his tweets about it, and the subsequent backlash.  Callers Shelly (from Ronkonkoma), who complimented Norton, and Raphael (who unsuccessfully attempted to explain Cumia's cable problems), participated in this segment.  The show also featured in-studio banter between Opie (mostly off-mic), Cumia, and Norton, alongside Sam Roberts and Danny Ross, along with comments about listeners, callers, and production.  A video clip of an eagle led to a digression about eagles' eyesight, phone service issues with AT&T, and the physical characteristics of birds. The entire broadcast was characterized by profanity, vulgarity, and cynical humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Come on.  Come on, everybody.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  It's becoming a parody of itself, isn't it?  Yeah.  I saw him there with his little tissues in his collar.  Just sitting there.  No, it's not a replay. 
[00:01:30]  We're live.  Believe me.  I know.  It's every morning now.  I'm obsessed with this guy.  Every time I pop out of that elevator,  I just look right at that dumb fucking podium  and have to look at his dumb face.  Good morning.  Good morning.  With gusto, he says it.  I love it.  Well, good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  And for the vacationing, Opie, no one, I guess.  But Jimmy Norton's here.  Yes, I am. 
[00:02:00]  And our own Sam Roberts and, of course, Danny Ross at the computer.  And it has just been a treat to actually say,  hey, Danny, could you punch up something on the Internet  and have it pop up within a minute?  And just it really reiterates what an awful job Sam Roberts does at the computer.  And on the mic.  If I had pulled up the Three Stooges dialogue scene that Danny pulled up,  which was a thing that just happened.  Yeah, but it worked out in the end. 
[00:02:30]  I would have been destroyed.  Yeah, I would have been destroyed, and then it would have worked out in the end anyway.  You're right.  You know why?  Why?  Because you're 95% bad, and he's like 95% right on the money.  So he makes one thing where it's like the Three Stooges.  But at least it was the Three Stooges.  You'd have pulled up fucking, like, the cat in the hat.  And we'd have been like, what the fuck is this shit?  I don't know.  You said you wanted an old show.  Yeah, I don't know.  You also, I don't have the learning, I'm on a learning curve.  Learning curve?  Yeah.  You should go to Sylvan, you tard. 
[00:03:00]  You're the worst.  Learning curve, my ass.  Yeah.  Well, it's a treat to have the internet actually available to the show in lieu of callers.  It's a treat to provide it for you guys.  Ah, see?  Everyone's having a treat.  Jimmy Norton, how are you this morning?  Oh, just filled with treats.  Ah.  Do you miss the callers?  I do not miss the callers whatsoever.  I forgot we had a phone.  I know.  It's great.  It's great.  And from a lot of the tweets that I read. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, I do read your tweets.  The fucking listeners don't miss the callers either.  Like, thank God.  You know who misses the callers?  The people that call in.  Yep.  And it's the same shitheads every fuck day.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know how I'm going to get through my day without hearing what Marcos from Yonkers has to say.  Lady Trucker misses the callers.  Oh, God, of course.  Bobo misses the callers.  Hey, I wanted to call in and make an obvious statement just to be on the air.  All right, cool.  All right. 
[00:04:00]  Every day?  Great.  Let's take it.  Yeah, Shelly from Ronkonkomo, you're on.  Oh, God.  Hi, guys.  You know, shut up.  We don't care.  Bleed.  Well, I got to start right away with this one.  I know where this is going.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Are you praising me?  Yes.  Jimmy Norton is the cutest boy.  Yay.  Okay.  I, as teased on Twitter, no. 
[00:04:30]  This rant wasn't teased on Twitter?  Yeah, it wasn't.  Okay.  I was up very late last night, and I want to thank all of my mommies out there that have  to say, don't you have a show to do in the morning?  Yeah, I do.  That's why I nap during the day and then come in here.  But I was up until after 2 a.m. watching some television, which, of course, I like to 
[00:05:00]  do.  And it is part of this gig to kind of be aware of what's on the TV.  A lot of people watch the television.  And in the city, I was staying in the city, in my compound west, as I like to call it,  and no one else does.  But I have Time Warner Cable.  Time Warner Cable in the city, as opposed to Fios out on Long Island.  Time Warner Cable. 
[00:05:30]  Now, I can't even put into words how infuriating it is to pay money.  You're paying for a service.  Yes.  And you're literally paying to get aggravated on a daily basis.  Not even a daily basis.  I wouldn't mind on a daily basis.  Once a day, if I got aggravated at Time Warner Cable and went, ah, motherfuckers.  Ah, look, the remote isn't working once today.  It is literally, minute by minute, aggravation with Time Warner Cable. 
[00:06:00]  And they know it's fucked, and they do nothing about it, and their customer service sucks fucking dick.  Well, they know you have no choice.  You're stuck with them.  Right.  They know that.  Exactly.  And I wouldn't put this past them.  I've heard rumor, an innuendo, that they are paying off buildings in Manhattan to not install Fios and other services in those buildings. 
[00:06:30]  Pay them money, little kickbacks, or whatever the fuck they call it, to not let another cable company come in and install cable in their building.  Because they know they would flock to the other service to get away from Time Warner Cable.  This is how pissed Time Fucko Cable got me last night at 2 in the morning.  I literally ordered a sling box at 2 a.m.  I ordered a sling box so I could stream my wonderful Fios service from my house to the apartment. 
[00:07:00]  And I will be canceling Time Warner Cable.  Thank you, Time Warner.  I will be canceling that service because you can't even give me the simplest of service.  I only have the minimum there.  I'm not in the city all the time.  So I have the minimum service.  I just have the basic channels.  And all I want it to do is work.  I want to be able to turn the TV on, have it actually come on, and then put on the channel guide and scroll fluidly through the channel guide to see what's on. 
[00:07:30]  And then when I have my show selected on the guide, press OK, and then have it go to that channel.  Is that a lot to ask in 2012?  In the future here?  When we reside?  I guess it is because I was also so infuriated at 2 in the morning that I decided to make a customer service call, which I should have recorded. 
[00:08:00]  But then I would have been tempted to play it without his permission, and I would have gotten in big trouble.  So don't say I should have recorded it because I couldn't have played it anyway.  How many sane customer service calls do you think they get at that hour?  Not many.  And they sure didn't last night either.  That's for sure.  What was wrong with the channel?  The cable box was completely rebooting every hour. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  Every hour.  And not even at the top of the hour.  It was just about every hour.  So in the middle of whatever you're watching, it just stopped and then went to the oh-so-fast reboot that happens with Time Warner boxes.  It's a good 10 minutes.  Every hour?  Every hour.  Every hour.  Every hour.  Every hour.  Every hour.  Every hour.  A 10-minute reboot to get back to New York 1.  To go back to a channel that then I got to go through the misery of the guide that is jumpy and doesn't flow. 
[00:09:00]  So now every hour I had to go through every single thing that pisses me off about Time Warner cable.  And so then I'm just like, you know what?  Fuck this.  I'm going to go to On Demand.  I'm going to go to my free TV On Demand, AMC, because, of course, some people have not seen all of the Walking Dead episodes. 
[00:09:30]  So I wanted to play them, and it wouldn't play.  It came up and said, not available right now.  Please try later.  So after everything, so I get on the fucking phone, and I go through their little beep, beep, beep menu, press one, press two, and I get a guy on the phone, and I guess I could have let him speak a little more.  I was the one just talking and talking, but I had so much to say. 
[00:10:00]  First thing they do is put you through a menu that says, and I think this is complete horseshit to throw everyone off their track.  They go, there are some outages in your area.  Really?  Oh, okay.  And we're working on it.  And then they go, they say this, too.  You could stay on for customer service, but, and it's the recording, but they will not be able to assist you with outages in the area.  So they're saying, there's an outage in your area. 
[00:10:30]  Don't call customer service because they can't assist you with this.  So they're pretty much telling you, ah, just hang up.  Because everybody's calling in at 2 o'clock in the morning to record an outage.  Right, right.  Exactly.  So I'm not going for the recording at all.  I wait for the guy.  He gets on there.  And I start going through my problem.  Actually, he came on pretty quickly.  And then he reiterates to me that he can't help about the outages.  I go, oh, I don't care about the outages.  If there's an outage, I go, that's fine.  That would be a rare occurrence, whatever.  I could deal with that. 
[00:11:00]  I go, but it's the day-to-day, and I didn't even say crap.  I made sure I didn't curse.  Because when you curse, that gives them every opportunity to hang up on you.  I said, it's the day-to-day garbage that I deal with with Time Warner Cable.  And then I started questioning him.  I go, do you have Time Warner Cable, sir?  He's like, yes, I do.  I said, are you happy with it?  Yes, I am.  I go, I'm thinking you're lying to me. 
[00:11:30]  I'm honestly thinking you're lying.  I go, does your screen freeze every, you know, every maybe 15 minutes?  And I was giving them the benefit of the doubt, because mine freezes literally every five minutes.  The screen will totally freeze.  And this is when it's not rebooting every hour.  It'll totally freeze.  No sound, no nothing.  And then it'll jump forward when it finally decides to kick in.  And that's a treat also.  Or how about when you're entering a bunch of codes into the remote, and it's not doing anything, but you're frustrated. 
[00:12:00]  So you keep hitting stuff, and then it finally decides to catch up.  Oh, to channel 70,000.  And so then it starts doing stuff that you can't stop it from doing for a minute until it catches up with all the key presses.  The retroactive key press.  Yeah.  And then it just decides, oh, I'll put in every key that he just hit.  All right now, in a whole row, and you won't be able to stop me.  Right, right.  No stopping me now.  I'm going to scroll 20 channels now, you fucks.  So the guy, I called him out for lying that he was happy with his own service, because I absolutely doubt that that ever happened. 
[00:12:30]  Then I started telling him about all the problems I had, the channel freezing, the rebooting, everything like that.  He honestly didn't want to hear it.  And then he says, and this got me also, well, there's really nothing I could do about it right now.  Our system is down here.  I went, well, what a coincidence.  My whole system's down, too.  My TV doesn't work. 
[00:13:00]  He had no answer for me.  I called customer service.  He got through.  I'm like, why are you there?  I go, you should just go home.  Go home.  That's what you told me?  Yeah.  I told him to take the rest of the day.  Go home and watch your wonderful time, wonder service.  He hung up on me.  I didn't curse.  I didn't do anything.  The motherfucker hung up on me.  That's why you should have recorded it.  I know.  I know.  I was so fucking pissed when he hung the phone up on me.  I did that thing where I just looked around the room and went, he hung up on me. 
[00:13:30]  I couldn't control my rate.  Did you get his name first?  Of course not.  Always get their names.  They're more leery to hang up.  It has to be.  Right, right.  Now I know who you are.  I know where you live.  Yeah.  You don't know who we are, but we know who you are.  Flip my 50.  Tell them you're recording it, too.  Yeah.  I've had them go, well, you're not supposed to.  I'm like, well, are you recording it?  Well, yes.  Well, then why can't I? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  You're recording this for quality control.  I'm recording for quality control and for a radio show.  Hope you don't mind.  I will do that next time.  Leave his name out.  I'm going to do it when I call up to cancel Time Warner Cable when I get my sling box put in and have the wonderfulness of Fios right there in my apartment.  Are they good sling box?  I had one.  I never used it.  Well, Danny swears by it.  They serve a purpose. 
[00:14:30]  You know what I'm saying?  And if your need is for that device, it works identically to what you need it to do for you.  So if you're â€“ like if you have a â€“ let's say you have a second apartment in the middle of the country somewhere.  Oh, I should be so lucky.  And you don't want to pay for cable.  You're just like, well, I'm barely here.  Why would I pay for cable?  It's ridiculous.  Hook up a sling box and now you have cable in your weekend place or wherever and you're not paying two separate cable bills.  Does it go through your computer?  Yeah.  I mean it's basically like one side of it is your TV at home, your box at home, and then you just kind of connect to it through this device. 
[00:15:00]  And so you just stream your â€“ whatever you have at your house on to wherever you are.  Is it as fast?  Yeah.  I mean there might be like a slight delay, like a â€“ you know.  Yeah.  Not even a split second, but â€“  Oh, yeah.  If anything is better than fucking Time Warner.  Believe me.  And I'm sure like the ones that I used to play with, I mean they're already years old, so I'm sure they've only gotten better since.  So I'm not worried.  I wouldn't be worried about it.  You know what I want to do?  I want to take a phone call because Raphael seems to know why my service doesn't work.  I bet your box is fucked up.  Oh, let's go. 
[00:15:30]  Raphael.  Yeah.  Hi.  You're one of the few callers today.  How are you, sir?  And please, please let me know why my service doesn't work.  All right, sir.  Well, you said you had an apartment, right, that the service is in?  Yes, sir.  Okay, well, the reason why the apartment is, they got so many lines coming out of the apartment, and each line can't â€“ that one line can't hang in all the apartments at one time.  So â€“  Hang up! 
[00:16:00]  I don't care.  First of all, apartment â€“ a schmartment.  When I was on Twitter last night posting my fucking hardships that I'm having with Time Warner, I got a bunch of people that were commiserating with the same exact problems I'm having.  Do they all live in my building?  Huh?  And I've known people with Fios in buildings that have no fucking problems just because there's a â€“ what?  I don't even live in a giant fucking metropolis building. 
[00:16:30]  I'm living in a building that's probably a couple of apartments on each floor, and there's like eight floors.  Stop!  What do you think?  I'm at a giant futuristic building.  I am.  Jimmy is.  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  See?  I have Fios.  And you have Fios, and it works, right?  Yes, it does.  See?  And there's a bunch of people, so don't give me shit.  It's fucking Time Warner that has no idea about fucking fixing their shit.  Are they not installing any more apartments at all?  Fios?  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  I heard tell something earlier.  We just said it on the air, but I guess they're still installing shit.  Maybe there's a timeline they have.  I had heard that, too, that certain buildings weren't going to get it, but I'm telling you, there was a mass exodus out of my building.  Oh, yeah.  There has to be.  Why pay for aggravation?  And, you know, they could be like, oh, well, whatever.  We lose one guy.  They don't care.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't care. 
[00:17:30]  And they, look, I cannot imagine they're not sitting there taking cancellation calls and going, wow, you know, we get a lot of cancellation calls.  How does that happen?  And then and I told the guy also, I go, I'm canceling your service when I put my sling.  I gave my whole life story when I when I put my sling box in.  I'm canceling the service and I go and I don't want to get calls from you guys a few weeks later going.  Would you please three sign up with us and we'll give you six months of shit for free? 
[00:18:00]  I don't want free shit.  I'd rather pay for good stuff.  I love when they try to get you back.  Cable vision did that with me.  They got came to my fucking door.  Guy knocks on my door and fucking.  Hi, I'm my shithead asshole from cable vision.  I want to get the fuck out of my face.  Like you just showing up at my doorstep.  Leave.  I canceled the service.  There was a reason for it.  And then he's trying to tell me that the service is better.  Well, you know, Fios has this and we have this. 
[00:18:30]  The files are we have.  Like I lived through it.  I fucking had your service.  It sucked.  So I got a better service that I'm happy with.  Well, we could knock the price down.  Fuck you.  I'm going to pay for, you know, why am I paying less for something I don't want?  Than paying the same or even a little more for something that I really do want.  News 12, Westchester.  News 12.  Wow, I sure miss it.  That is the one caveat, boy. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, do I miss News 12?  Those old people, they miss their News 12.  The complaining that I hear sometimes.  Oh.  Because, you know, some old woman doesn't have her fucking News 12 anymore.  And it's just like you just want to strangle them because they don't understand the difference.  They just know that they don't have something that they used to have.  And you just really want to put your fist through their abdomen.  I want the News 12.  It's nothing local Long Island news.  When you cancel Time Warner, will you tell them why?  I will go on a tarod like I have gone on on the phone. 
[00:19:30]  Yes, I absolutely will let them know that I was not very pleased with their service.  I don't get many contact notices from them.  Occasionally they'll write and they'll say, you know, we'd like to have you back.  But it's not a lot.  They're just a shit service.  One is too much.  One is too much.  And then the box was kind of, you know, working within the, in between the hour that it would reboot.  And I was dozing off around 2.45-ish. 
[00:20:00]  And, uh, and the insult to injury, the final little thing before I went off to dreamy land is, is hearing Time Warner Cable.  Yeah, it was a commercial, you know, where they toot their own fucking horn on the cable company's thing.  And they were telling how great it is.  Our speeds are fast.  Well, the television package.  And I, I, I just kind of looked over my shoulder and looked at the TV like, you gotta be shitting me.  Well, Bob Kelly has the new one.  He's swearing he's getting the new one. 
[00:20:30]  The new faster one.  He's saying, oh, fuck you, Bobby.  What a lump of shit.  That, no, it's not.  You're brainwashed.  You know, I fucking called, uh, I had some issues like, like everyone else who lives in New York and has an iPhone with AT&T.  Uh, you know, there was a, you know, you're in the middle of Manhattan and nothing works.  It's frustrating.  So you call and, and I was just, you know, asking the guy on the phone, I was just like, you know, that's a metropolis.  It's, it's 10 million people.  Like, how does the phone not work in Times Square? 
[00:21:00]  It's ridiculous.  And the guy, he just, well, he goes, well, you know, if you read your user agreement, it does say that we are, you know, that you will not be covered 100% of the time.  And I'm like, are you fucking kidding, are you telling me that, like, tough luck, tough titty, sir?  Like, I know that you're trying to pay for a service here, but you signed, you signed the piece of paper that said, that said tough titty on it.  And who fucking reads the service contract?  Are you kidding me?  And when it says it's not available in all areas, I would assume it means if you're in the high desert of Utah, perhaps you'll have an issue.  Exactly.  And I'm like, dude, I was like, this is the middle. 
[00:21:30]  I was like, do you understand that they call Times Square the crossroads of the universe?  Yeah.  I was like, you understand, I can't get, I can't send a text message?  Perhaps a few bars there might help.  And here's another thing, too.  I said, well, how much is it to cancel my contract right at this very moment?  And he goes, well, you don't have a lot of thing, you know, oh, it costs, you know, $200 or whatever.  And I said, well, that's ridiculous.  I'm not paying for that.  So I was just like, what are you going to do to, you know, rectify this?  Because, like, I'm not, we can't just hang up the phone and have this continue.  So what's going to happen? 
[00:22:00]  So he offered me, like, $20 off on my bill for the next six months.  And I'm like, well, okay, that's great for six months.  But I was like, I don't want that.  I just want to leave.  So I was just like, why don't you take me that value, that $120 value that you were just offering me, apply it to the contract cancellation fee.  Yeah.  I'll pay the balance.  And then I'm gone.  And we'll go on a day.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, sir.  I can't do that.  And I was just like, you know.  But you know what?  It's not about money.  They're breaching their contract by providing the service so poorly.  I think so.  That's a breach of contract because you're right.  Certain times you're going to get a call dropped. 
[00:22:30]  It happens.  Whatever.  Verizon has it happen.  Although I was texting on the plane.  I was on the fucking plane.  You were doing what?  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  It was wonderful.  Everyone knows you can't do that.  It's not possible.  I know.  The planes you can't call or do.  30,000 feet.  Some of them wouldn't go through, but I had a few actually go through back and forth.  Wow.  I was like, if AT&T on 6th Avenue, I'm fucked.  So you should be able to cancel for, like, when they look at your record and see that  many fucking tax messages that don't go through, they should lie to you. 
[00:23:00]  They don't want cancellations, though.  No.  No, because they figure that you'll just forget or, like, you'll calm down or cool off and  then just continue to pay.  And I'm just not.  And they don't want to tell their shareholders that they're losing subscribers.  And, like, all I really want to hear out of somebody on the other end of the phone  is just a little bit of honesty.  Just be like, yeah, you know, it is problematic.  We've been having a lot of trouble.  You know, like, that's all you got to say.  And I'll be like.  No, you hear excuses.  And I'll be like.  And they'll be like, well, maybe it's your SIM card.  And I'm just like, well, I don't know.  I mean, you know, it's a lot of different people that I know with the phone.  So I really don't think it's, you know, 12 people that I know with bad SIM cards. 
[00:23:30]  It's everybody that's been in New York City with AT&T knows there's a fucking issue.  Oh, well, maybe it's just a bad tower.  Where are you having the problem?  Do you know that you.  This is what they fucking offered me as a solution.  Did you know that there's an app where you can report dead spots?  Oh, cool.  And I'm like, that's not the fucking problem.  The problem is there's a dead spot called Manhattan that I need fucking services.  Why should you all of a sudden go to go to work for them for free?  Yeah.  You're now telling them.  And like, and I'm still paying my service for your whatever.  And you're not helping me with my issue.  And then you're basically saying, well, if it doesn't work, go fuck yourself because you signed a contract. 
[00:24:00]  But those service agreements where it costs you money to get out of it like that, it's robbery.  It's ridiculous.  And they only do it because they know they could give you subpar service and you have no recourse aside from losing money.  And that's the only reason.  Like, why would they do that unless they wanted to keep you as a customer even though they're fucking you?  I have had them so many times give me money back because for months, like, I mean, like, they'll give you maybe sometimes $50 or whatever. 
[00:24:30]  But I'm getting six months.  Six months, I get 20 bucks credit.  Nice.  Too bad I won't be with AT&T long enough to totally take advantage of that.  All of it because the second, the day my contract's out, I'm going to leave.  I always, always demand more per person.  And sometimes you've got to spend, you know, two or three people's worth of time to get what you really want. 
[00:25:00]  So it becomes not worth it.  It's like, what am I really fighting for here?  So it's just like, all right, go fuck yourself.  I'll deal with you in June.  They know that.  That's the way they look at it too.  They're like, they don't.  It's unfortunate.  The doctor is in.  Dr. Gay!  In your butt.  Yeah, Dr. Gay.  The doctor is in.  What's up there, Travis?  I'm the last one to stand up for AT&T.  Oh.  Or any phone company for that matter.  Are you protesting for them?  That's all your signs?  Yeah.  Occupy.  But, you know, when you want to cancel your contract and they want you to pay, that's because you bought a subsidized phone. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, no, I understand.  And they need to get their money back.  Sure, I understand that.  Okay.  Now, I'm just making sure that when you buy an iPhone for $300 instead of $600, the way they make their money is by you paying a bill for two years.  Who invited the suit?  Oh, I know they've made their money.  Oh, trust me.  I know they've made their money, but that's the reason.  Corporate shill.  That is true.  That's true.  You know what, though?  How come when I bought my other iPhone, it cost me the same amount?  I had to pay retail for the iPhone.  Because you were still under contract.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, because you were still under contract for the original one. 
[00:26:00]  I'm not saying it makes sense or it's right.  It's like, hey, wait a minute.  I'm paying full price.  Now you should just cut off the fucking...  Well, they'll say, yeah, no problem, Mr. Kumey.  Can we sign you up for another two years?  Just got to tell me about your fee.  I hate the word fee now.  I can't hear the word fee without thinking of Wade saying it.  It's a hacky thing to say what's on the phone bill and go over every one.  I can't have a radio show.  Yeah, yeah.  But it really isn't enraging the fees and charges.  They just fuck you.  They just fuck you.  Just turning the screws on you.  And again, it's a lot of taxes and stuff. 
[00:26:30]  So it's not even the phone company fucking you as far as that goes.  It's all these people that have decided for some reason they could just reach into your pocket  and pull out shit and just tag it onto your phone bill.  How did that happen?  Hey, what can we do?  Why don't we just add some shit to the phone bill?  Oh, okay.  It's like somebody just charging shit to your fucking credit card.  You know what his name is?  Yeah, we just want to charge your credit card. 
[00:27:00]  Surcharge.  Surcharge!  Surcharge!  Oh, boy.  Surcharge.  Oh, you should get an elbow for that one.  It's like a funny joke.  I think there were some commercials that were going around, right?  Wasn't there like a Verizon commercial?  Surcharge.  He doesn't work here, Surcharge.  I was like, where'd he go?  Is he going to get fired or something?  Travis has his bill up.  Yeah, I just want to see what, you know.  Whoa, you pay that much?  $13. 
[00:27:30]  Well, this is for two phones.  $13 usage charge.  Like, what the fuck is that?  Isn't that the phone bill?  What the fuck does that even mean?  $2 for credits slash adjustments slash other charges.  Other.  That's it, just other.  What the fuck does that even mean?  Government fees and taxes, $12.  You know how many people are paying $12 and how that adds up to the government getting that and still not knowing what the fuck to do with it? 
[00:28:00]  I don't like a usage fee.  Usage?  Usage.  That's the whole thing you're getting.  That's the initial just bill.  You shouldn't have a fee on top of the bill because you're using it.  Of course I'm using it.  That's like football selling you those fucking ownership rights.  Yeah.  The rights to own.  PSLs.  PS, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  For your particular bill, Travis, you're paying, the math comes to 15% of your bill.  It's just taxes and fees and shit.  That's great.  That's great, right?  Other.  Well, at least you're doing your fair share.  Sure am.  Do your fair share. 
[00:28:30]  Aren't some people getting free phone service?  Some of these fucking welfare shitheads.  Aren't they getting free phone service?  Are they getting free cell phones?  We just read about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's something I'm sure I should research a little more before I just totally wipe up.  Are you talking about the homeless 4G hotspot thing?  No, no, not the hotspot thing.  No, this was going back a couple of months and I heard that some people were getting free cell phones to use.  I don't know.  Oh, that's nice.  You know, drug deals or stuff, whatever. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, and that, well, I also had another problem yesterday that was infuriating.  I understand many of these are what we call your white people problems.  I understand.  Or luxury problems.  Luxury problems.  But you know something?  Why should I be inconvenienced and not be able to watch television when I'm paying for a service?  That's all I'm trying to say.  Problem two yesterday.  Holy fuck.  I decided I was going to go out on the town. 
[00:29:30]  A little dinner.  A little dinner.  Just me.  Just me.  A little night out.  I was going to find a nice little itrallian place.  Get myself some veal marsala.  So I find a really nice place with outdoor seating and not on the sidewalk.  I hate that.  It's like an area that's kind of fenced in.  Little wrought iron fence about two foot high. 
[00:30:00]  Little dug in pit like area that all these nice tables are in.  But it's outside.  So you can watch the people walking on the sidewalk.  And I'm sitting out there.  I get a nice bottle of wine.  I got the cheese and the bread.  And oh, it's wonderful.  Oh, like my mother used to make.  By the way, this is Anthony.  Did not go by himself.  Anthony had a male escort meet him.  Oh, right?  A male escort.  A young Brazilian lad.  Like Madonna used to fight. 
[00:30:30]  Hi, Daddy.  A nice 20-year-old.  Well, a Brazilian backup dancer.  Uncut.  It was night.  And the weather last night was about 60 degrees in the city.  Just wonderful.  I was just sitting there relaxing.  It was great.  And then, God, if I only had something I could make the sound with.  Picture, take any coffee cup, right?  Fill it with washers, old keys, and maybe some change. 
[00:31:00]  And now shake it like a fucking maraca.  And do that on the sidewalk.  Begging for change.  And literally harassing people that are going by.  And cursing at them when they don't give you change.  And that was the soundtrack to this wonderful evening that I was paying good money for to sit and enjoy myself.  That was the soundtrack to that fucking night. 
[00:31:30]  Because some fucking...  And this guy, believe me, healthy as a horse.  No, no, no.  It looked like he had no physical ailments.  Could have been working or something to get money.  But he's clark, clark, clark, shaking his fucking change cup.  As I'm just trying to enjoy a night out.  Now, I tweeted this last night.  And people were getting a little pissy with me.  Like, oh, it can't take, it can't do this.  But Eddie Murphy. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, Eddie Murphy on the rolly thing from Trading Places.  Yeah, I was Agent Orange.  Agent Orange was my codename.  And people were getting pissy with me like I was being snobbish and I had no sympathy.  But here's the deal.  Why have we reached a point in our society where you're not even allowed to go out and perhaps be pissed if you want to enjoy yourself.  And you have to be tolerant, you have to be tolerant with everyone else's fucking problems that you can't completely enjoy a night out that you're paying good money for. 
[00:32:30]  I'm the asshole now.  Because there's such an irrational annoyance of people who have money.  It's like there are times where there's times of people who have money get away with this shit and bitch for no reason.  It's like if you're legitimately eating and some asshole, that would annoy anybody.  And people forget that that's annoying.  It's annoying.  If you're homeless and you're walking by some, that's different.  If you're just standing there.  You're standing in one spot. 
[00:33:00]  That would annoy anybody.  And everyone that was walking by, he was like rushing towards them with his head down at them going, you change, change, change.  Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.  And it wasn't even like, it wasn't even like, it's not really a money thing either.  It was a fucking restaurant.  It's not like I'm at the Ritz.  You know, anyone could have been there and been, like you said, annoyed.  But then I tweet it and these fucking assholes got to be like, oh, you know, oh, you're high and mighty.  Oh, what?  He interrupted because he's hungry and you're eating. 
[00:33:30]  He interrupted your time.  Yes, he did interrupt it.  And why am I not entitled to go out and enjoy a night out without having some fuckhead ruining it by shaking his fucking change a cup?  To me, it's like, no, I'm not tolerant when it comes to that.  It is annoying.  You think that's a misconception of people like across the country, though, the thing that there's like.  Or a misconception.  Oh, you got the forearm. 
[00:34:00]  But there's like one homeless guy in New York and like, oh, what's the big deal?  He's just looking for some money.  Like this is like Otis the Drunk in Mayberry.  There's one guy.  No, there's a fuckload of these idiots.  And they're perfectly healthy.  They could work if they weren't insane.  There's a guy I see at Penn Station recently, almost every day now.  And, you know, he was a youngish kind of kid.  He's not particularly dirty.  And he's got a sign that says that he's homeless and hungry.  Thanks.  And advanced and all that stuff.  But every time I pass him, he's eating.  And it's just like, well, it's just like I'm not going to give you any fucking money for food. 
[00:34:30]  It's like you got McDonald's one day.  You got a bagel the next day.  It's like you're eating better than me, motherfucker.  Perhaps you're eating.  Yeah.  You're not hungry.  Nobody who worked there tried to shoo him off?  No, no.  Although.  Was he on your side of the street or across the street?  Well, he started out across the street.  But it was echoing off the building.  He was doing this on purpose to be really loud and get attention to himself.  That's like his thing.  You know, some people have the mangy dog with him. 
[00:35:00]  And other people have the weird sign.  It's a woman laying in the plastic bag.  Uh, he had the loud change cup.  He's loud change cup guy.  So, uh, that's how he started.  Then after I tweeted how pissed I was and everything, this motherfucker comes over to the two foot  high wrought iron little fence around my outdoor area that I was enjoying, comes right up to it and goes,  Yo, brah.  Yeah, I'm hungry out here on the street. 
[00:35:30]  I turned, I turned to him and went, take it the fuck back across the street.  Take it the fuck back across the street.  I'm eating.  I'm eating.  And, and, and he's like, oh, man, man.  And he gets all pissed, but he, he turned and went away.  And then, uh, uh, the waiter comes over and it was a real Italian place with real Italians, you know?  So I knew I was safe and whatever I said.  Uh, so, so I was like, he's like, how is everything?  I was like, it's, it's fucking great. 
[00:36:00]  I go, this, this food's fantastic.  I go, it's a perfect night except for that fucking guy and his change cup.  And he goes, oh yeah, that motherfucker.  And then we might've had a personal conversation.  You, um, you know what you could have done for the rest of your meal?  Shoot him?  That was suggested on Twitter.  You should have said for $5, you should have given him five bucks.  Now, of course, why should you have to?  But I mean, cause you can't.  Yeah, yeah.  Give him 10 bucks and go, your, your cup is driving me nuts.  Here's 10 bucks to go two blocks away for two hours. 
[00:36:30]  What is this, Bronx tail?  Yeah.  You give him 10 bucks.  It goes away.  He's out of your hair.  Wow, wow, Jim.  You read?  You tell him that to fucking shoe motherfucker.  Here's 10 bucks.  Stop shaking that cup.  That was Louie beans across the street shaking his cup.  Oh, please.  Hey, what's the matter with you, see?  You're trying to eat.  The man's shaking his lug nuts and cup.  You guys are shaking the cup.  You give him 10 bucks, he's out of your hair. 
[00:37:00]  God, you're smart.  You reason?  They should have cut divorce holding a book upside down.  It's the big clock.  Tick tock.  Oh, fuck, man.  Yeah, so that got me infuriated.  Then there was, yeah, so I was talking to the guy.  It was a really nice restaurant.  The guy started literally harassing people up and down the sidewalk, cursing at them when 
[00:37:30]  they wouldn't give him change.  What the fuck is that all about?  And it's a weird line because these restaurants can't do much.  Nope.  It's a free sidewalk.  If you want to have that, they can't say, and I hear people, like, pretend they don't  understand why that's annoying when they're like, whoa, you can't do anything.  It is annoying.  And you can't, you know, act like you don't understand how fucking enraging that is when  you're trying to eat.  And some guy's just being an obnoxious asshole in that area. 
[00:38:00]  Yes.  Oh, it was, people were saying I was living a Billy Joel song.  It was, it was like that, which one is that?  The, a bottle of white.  Oh, yeah.  A bottle of red.  Italian restaurant.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd like to shoot this in the head.  Ah, there I am.  See, this is the kind of, this is what I wanted.  Yeah.  It was perfect.  There was the, the checkerboard tablecloth, the little red and white checkered tablecloth. 
[00:38:30]  Ah, I had my, I had the red.  I had the red.  Ah, yeah.  I cannot understand what this said.  A table near the street, right?  In our old familiar place, you and I.  Not looking at that f*** face. 
[00:39:00]  That's what I thought.  Ah, yeah.  Shaking his coins.  White.  Ah.  On your, I'm trying to eat.  Shut up, you f***.  Meet you anytime you want.  In this noisy f***ing restaurant.  Ah.  That's great. 
[00:39:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yes.  I'm trying to eat my prosciutto and cantaloupe.  My prosciutto.  Like a mama used to make.  Oh.  Tony and Eddie.  Tony and Eddie.  My money.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's what it was, though.  Literally echoing off a building with that change fucking cup.  And I'm, and then I'm the asshole.  I'm the asshole.  That's because people are just being phony. 
[00:40:00]  Pretend they don't understand why that's annoying.  I know.  It is annoying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If a guy was walking by doing it, but if he's just standing there, who wants to hear  that?  Nobody.  Uh, one thing that was kind of fun was watching, um, when, when you are sitting on the sidewalks  here in New York, uh, eating a little dinner or whatnot, you catch these five second snippets  of conversation between people.  It's like, as they're walking by and it's everything.  I can do it.  It's school.  I got a thing to do with you.  Your work is everything.  Our business. 
[00:40:30]  I can't.  I mean, I'm f***ing ass on who it's like.  And it's all just these little snippets of conversations that are, um, nothing.  I mean, I don't want to hear them, but, uh, it's just kind of, uh, interesting with the  little things you catch.  Well, that was the fun of walking by people.  And we would always have those obnoxious momentary.  Oh, cause you knew they would only listen to that.  So you'd make shit up.  Right.  And just literally just walk by and go, uh, I don't care if she's pregnant, I'll throw  her down the stairs and walk right by.  Well, that was a big popular one. 
[00:41:00]  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd talk about your AIDS test.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot that one.  Yeah.  The AIDS test.  Yeah.  I don't know if I'm AIDS.  So what if I have AIDS?  I'm not telling her.  Yeah.  I'm not telling her.  Jimmy would do this to the elevator till right when we'd walk into an elevator, he'd  start up this conversation we were not having.  And you start in the middle of the conversation like that.  You know, it came back positive, but I'm not telling her.  Why should I, you know, I don't know how much time I have and why should. 
[00:41:30]  It's none of our business.  And he's, and he, he'd, he'd let the people know he was with me by going, right, right.  And then tap me on the shoulder.  And I would sit there stone faced, like not acknowledging him because it's a really weird  line of people.  Like you, do you mind your business or do you get involved in the conversation?  Right.  People will get involved sometimes in the conversation.  Or they'll at least look at their friend or some, look at somebody else and make that  horrified face.  And it's just so embarrassing.  That's one of the biggest things I miss about the old building is just taking elevators 
[00:42:00]  with Jim.  Up with Jim.  Yeah.  The farts were hilarious.  The, the, you know, a lot of people don't talk in the elevator, so it's absolutely quiet.  And you just hear, not even trying to fake it.  And I would go into a convulsing laugh where I could not even breathe.  It is funny.  Thank God, because it stunk.  But yeah, and the elevator door would open.  I'd, I'd literally run out because I was laughing hysterically and embarrassed to holy hell.  It's unfortunate that that was a five story trip. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Whereas here we have like 30 something, like, oh man, we could have really made some good  use of this time.  We don't all come and go at the same time.  But the caliber of the, of the tenants that were in that other building, like they were so  snobby.  I think it made, it more than made up for it.  Like it was like, it was like four floors of the economist and the fucking Steinway.  The economist and Steinway building.  Yeah.  That was a hoity toity building.  Remember John Valby on the Steinway, how funny it was.  Oh, that was great.  Downstairs playing his, that was filthy song.  That was the first day I ever met Bob Kelly.  And he didn't introduce me as like a comedian, introduce himself to me as a comedian. 
[00:43:00]  He was just like, I'm Jimmy.  Well, he shouldn't have.  I guess that was a fucking softball.  He still shouldn't.  Exactly.  And so he just introduced himself as like Jimmy's friend.  And now I'm running around the block trying to find John Valby's van.  And I just have fucking Bob Kelly following me.  And like, he's just annoying me.  He's trying to like, like get me, you know?  Oh no.  And so we're walking together and he's like, hey dude.  And then I look and he looks away and I'm just like.  Why is this fan doing this?  He's so annoying. 
[00:43:30]  People still say that.  Who the fuck is this guy?  He's so annoying.  When's the headliner coming on?  All these years later and it's like, you know, you know Bobby and it's like, you love Bobby to death.  It's like, I can't even believe that's the same person.  Like I hated him that day.  Bobby.  Fucking hate him.  Yeah.  We got, I guess, Rich is coming in today.  Yeah.  And Bonnie.  That's a show in itself right there, isn't it?  Oh boy, those two.  How come eagles always look so concerned about things?  They got those eyes.  There's four of them left.  They are concerned.  When's my turn? 
[00:44:00]  What happened to Harry?  There was five.  Oh no.  They should all just be going, hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well.  They're all trying to find how to use Propecia, you know, because they're bald eagles.  They're humiliated by their hair loss.  We don't look like accountants and we're dying.  What's wrong with us?  A feather weave.  Yeah.  They do, though, look very concerned.  They're so much bigger than you really think they are.  They're kind of cool.  They're beautiful birds.  Powerful.  Can you imagine that thing coming down to try to snatch you away? 
[00:44:30]  Can't they see from way up?  800 miles away they could see.  I heard they could see the ocean from two miles.  That's crazy.  No, but they can see like fucking rats and fucking mice at these heights.  Yeah.  They fly around and then they see something and they dive at it and they just pick up a  fucking whole rabbit to carry him away.  That's where eagle eye comes from.  What can they see?  And they swoop down and grab it right off the ground. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put that.  Wait.  No way.  This thing takes a goat.  What was that?  A goat?  I just clicked it, man.  This is a big eagle out in the wild and I see a bunch of like mountain goats at the eagle  coming off his little perch.  He's gliding.  That thing coming out here is a motherfucker.  This thing is fucking like a turd.  He's in that tuck position.  He's diving down.  He's got his little fucking talons out. 
[00:45:30]  Stop.  There's no fucking way that thing is taking a goat.  No, that's a...  Oh, fly away with it.  Oh, oh.  He's dragging him off the fucking cliff.  Oh, fuck.  What does he do?  He drags the fucking thing off the cliff.  Wow.  It's plummeting to its death.  What an asshole.  What a fucking dick that bird is.  And eagle is a baby, obviously, right?  I don't know.  That's a smart ass bird. 
[00:46:00]  No, wait.  Was that thing fucking with its nest?  No.  I don't think so.  He's eating.  He's going to eat it.  Yeah, it was just too heavy.  It's a great strategy.  So he fucking lets it plummet to its death.  Do you think he meant to drop it or just...  No.  I think it was too heavy for him.  What do you think that goat's thinking?  Like, what the fuck?  He is carrying it away now, though.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  He's carrying a fucking goat.  That's a baby goat.  It has to be.  Who cares?  That's insane.  Yeah, I'm going to rank that as impressive no matter what... 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, that's...  Fuck.  No matter what the age of said goat.  That was some amazing wildlife footage.  Damn, nature.  You crazy.  Yeah.  How big do these birds get?  How big is that bird?  They have an 82-foot wingspan, Jimmy.  Oh, that would explain all the strength in their little talons.  Or is it shallons, I say?  God damn.  I fucking hate when people dislike, like, it's nature.  Like, this is just...  How do you not like that?  Yeah, but it's what happens in life.  It's fucking Timothy Wolfe hated it. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's a wolf scene.  Timothy Wolfe.  The entire Wolfe family did not find this entertaining at all.  Dumb goat.  How they do that dumb chewing with those dead eyes.  Good.  Good for him.  He was probably like, what's this bird trying to fucking do?  Yeah.  He's trying to carry me away?  You can't carry...  Holy shit, I'm plummeting.  I'm plummeting.  Oh, man.  It's a big fucking bird.  That is a huge fucking bird.  You can't even tell because you can't... 
[00:47:30]  Are they eagles?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  They're so lovely, we should protect them.  They're fucking beating the shit out of everything.  You know how happy other people in the neighborhood are that they're dead?  You think the goats are upset that fucking some hunter capped that eagle?  They would love it.  What would...  That's a wolf.  I don't even think they're on the endangered list anymore.  Eagles.  I don't think so.  I think they got taken off.  Yeah, I think they're off of that fucking endangered species list.  But that eagle is not really that even scared of that goat.  He's fucking around.  They're fighting over the same... 
[00:48:00]  Pulling the entrails out.  Well, this one's...  That's a wolf.  A wolf.  I'm sorry, yeah.  Fucking ballsy, man.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what it's like to try to put your hand in on a dog food when the dog is trying  to eat...  Imagine a wolf.  Like, you don't even have, like, a claw that you could, like, swipe at.  No.  You're opening your mouth versus fucking claws and shit.  Like, that's fucking balls.  But is an eagle...  Who do you mean?  The wolf?  No, it's balls for the bird.  Yeah, the bird's got it.  I mean, do you go up against a wolf like that?  And all you could do is, you know, fly away and open your mouth?  You could fly.  That's kind of a good getaway, though.  You know the wolf can't come after you. 
[00:48:30]  I'll bet you those fucking claws are pretty strong, though.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, the birds?  Yeah, but, you know, you got to get in the position for that.  Those big fucking...  How big is an eagle, though?  How big are those things?  Oh, Jimmy, that wingspan has to...  I don't know.  Eight feet.  Eight feet, yeah.  Eight fucking feet.  That's a big fuck.  That's crazy.  That should be crazy.  Six feet.  Six feet?  Nah.  I'd say it's like a hummingbird.  I'm saying ten feet.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Wingspan, uh, typically between, let's call it six and seven and a half feet. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Eight feet.  Seven feet.  That's a problem.  Round it up.  Eight feet.  That's a big motherfucking bird, man.  That's crazy.  That is fucking crazy.  And how high up can they see a mouse for?  That's Big Bird.  No, that's Big Bird.  Wait a minute.  That's different.  What's the wingspan of Big Bird?  I'm sorry.  What did you say, Jenny?  How high up can they see a mouse from?  Oh, 75,000 feet.  How does...  That's so high.  How does Big Bird fucking catch anything with his puffy, soft talons? 
[00:49:30]  He actually has to climb.  He has to get on his hands and knees and pull himself onto a hood just to shit on a car.  Big Bird's a cunt.  Big Bird stinks.  He doesn't have sharp talons.  They're very soft and cuddly.  Sat glove feet.  Like hamburger helper feet.  Yes.  Big Bird sucks.  Oh, yeah.  Eyesight.  Look at that.  How far can they see?  They could see for miles and miles.  An eagle flying...  An eagle flying...  An altitude of 1,000 feet. 
[00:50:00]  Over open country could spot prey over an area almost three square miles from a fixed position.  Wow.  So he could see three miles from a fixed position, though.  He's got to be on a ridge or something.  Yeah.  Wow.  No, but that's fine.  People flying at an altitude of 1,000 feet.  Here, wait.  Bald eagles are capable of seeing fish in the water from several hundred feet above while  soaring, gliding, or in flapping flight.  Amazing.  It's like the animal planet we're doing here today.  But that's an animal planet. 
[00:50:30]  Their eyesight is so good, they could read fucking close-up.  Oh, I bet.  Don't need glasses.  Spectacles.  Read close-up.  I love to have fucking eagle eyes.  Although it sucks because you only look at worms and fucking mice.  Worms?  Well, great eyesight wasted on ugly things.  Worms?  Eagles, what a shit life.  Their eyesight is so great.  They don't get to read.  They don't get to look at chicks through the window naked.  It's like, what do you use that great eyesight for?  I ate a mouse that was shitting in fear. 
[00:51:00]  Fucking faggots.  Should wipe those eagles off the map.  Keep their eyes.  I hate the way parakeets look at stuff.  You ever see that, man?  How they look at shit sideways with one eye?  They got their dumb fucking eyes on the sides of their head.  Like, that's the...  What is that?  The sign of predator and prey?  Yeah, yeah.  Predators have their eyes on the front of their head,  and prey's got it on the side of their head.  Right, to look for shit.  And, yeah, the dumb fucking prey birds.  They're the ones that kind of...  They've got to cock their heads to the side,  and look at your one eye like a chicken. 
[00:51:30]  Chickens look so fucking stupid.  Yeah, their necks actually have fucking bullseyes on them.  Chop here.  A dotted line, yeah.  Dotted line with a little axe.  Perforated.  Yeah, they're perforated necks.  So you can just tear them off.  They're bred that way now.  Yeah, they're the dumb eyes.  We've obviously talked about this in the past,  because Jimmy's a...

[01:01:00]  Grasshopper, the entrepreneur's phone system.  You're listening to the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show, Sirius XM.  Jimmy had a dream to the point he got up out of bed and started typing at 4.47.  Is it called typing even though you're on your computer?  True.  The act is typing.  It's just not a typewriter.  Right.  And you wrote some notes about your dream.  I just, it's very disjointed, but it was a very bizarre dream,  and I don't know exactly what it was about. 
[01:01:30]  It started before the dream.  I was in Conan O'Brien's studio,  and I didn't realize that the stage was raised,  so I went up one level.  I was trying to get on the stage to see somebody I knew,  but then the area was filled up with water,  so I think I had to piss.  So that had nothing to do with the dream.  What do you mean that had nothing to do with the dream?  I don't know what happened.  Were you dreaming that?  Yeah, but then I was at like the front.  How do you know that had nothing to do with the dream?  Like, because I remembered it after, but it was before.  And then I was at like Brewer's house or somebody's house, 
[01:02:00]  and the backyard was flooded,  and I kept trying to, like, there was a hose in the backyard.  I was very thirsty.  I really wanted to drink out of the hose,  which I hope isn't a fucking blowjob reference.  Yes.  You were thirsty a lot.  I was very freaked out.  So here's the main dream.  I don't know what the event was,  but George Bush Jr. and Bill Clinton were going to be at the event,  and I had access to them.  Wow.  And I don't know how I remember,  but I got a picture with Bill Clinton, 
[01:02:30]  and I was getting a picture with George Bush,  and he was friendly,  but I handed my camera to a woman,  and she was shaking so badly,  and she was pointing the underside of the camera.  And I'm like, no.  Oh, no, just completely fucking Jimmy's picture.  And I'm like, no, no, no, turn around, turn around.  So she's shaking fucking violently.  And then we get the picture,  and I remember I slapped Bush on the back,  and I go, I knew you'd be so much fun to meet and talk to,  and he was very friendly. 
[01:03:00]  And then as we're done taking our picture,  I notice another guy walks around from behind us.  So I realize, I'm like, I hope he's not in my fucking picture with us.  Jimmy has these dreams about these picture anxiety things.  But I, so I look at the picture,  and it's extremely pixelated and blurry,  and we look like three homeboys.  Like, I'm in the front, and George Bush is,  you can kind of see him behind me,  and this other guy is behind him.  Oh, photo-bombed you.  But it looked like the actor who played fucking Charles Keating in the movie. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know who that was in the Keating Lone and Scandal movie.  So I'm like, I have to get,  the picture's very, very blurry.  So I know I have to get another copy of this picture.  And E-Rock is around,  and he tells me that these guys are appearing at this other public place.  And if I just wait there with E-Rock, he'll take me there.  But right now, he's going to,  because he's going to help someone else get a picture with the president.  So just stay there with E-Rock.  E-Rock's your go-to guy.  He's my go-to guy.  But I don't remember why, 
[01:04:00]  but I went back to an old location that I had been in earlier in the dream  to see if the presidents were there.  I got greedy.  And this girl who I really liked was there,  and she goes, no, they left, you missed them.  Oh, no.  And she was hurt for some...  Why didn't you listen to E-Rock?  I don't know.  But this girl was hurt.  She was injured.  And she asked to borrow some money for a cup of coffee.  She needed money for a coffee shop.  So I gave her 20.  I'm like, no, no, keep it.  You don't have to pay me back.  Because I wanted her to go out with me.  But I kept giving her my number and reading the digits, 
[01:04:30]  but she couldn't understand the number.  Why don't you hate that?  I was like 7539, and I kept writing it,  but I couldn't write it where she would read it.  Jesus.  But then I realized I'm missing the president.  I realized I was wasting time here.  I'm wasting time with this dumb bitch.  So I panic, and I run back to the place.  It's the Sirius XM office.  But it's a giant open...  Like, you ever see the inside of a shopping mall  with like an open-air vestibule  and all these shops around? 
[01:05:00]  That's what the office was like.  And Jim Brewer was there,  and Keith Robinson was there.  And I'm like, where's E-Rock?  And they're all laughing at me.  Ah, stupid, looking for E-Rock.  And they're all laughing at me  because I'm trying to find Eric.  And I'm looking through my cell phone  for fucking E-Rock's number,  and I'm panicking.  Because I look up E-Rock,  and I realize I have him under Eric,  and I just keep dialing the wrong number,  and I can't get fucking E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  This is so exhausting.  So I finally bump into Andrew Moss,  who is our CFO,  the Chief Financial Officer here, 
[01:05:30]  who is who I know and I like.  And he's wearing a college sweatshirt,  and he's bleeding from the lip,  and he has blood all over the front of his shirt.  Jeez.  I probably punched him.  No, he didn't look hurt.  He just had blood on the front of his shirt.  But I knew him wearing a college sweatshirt,  man.  He wasn't well-dressed anymore.  I missed the event.  And he goes, I go like, is it happening?  Did I miss it?  He goes, no, no, but I think we're leaving.  He goes, the address is 5th and Beam.  5th and Beam. 
[01:06:00]  So I have to get to 5th and Beam here in Manhattan,  and I'm walking along,  and I hear this old lady driving by,  yelling at the car,  and a black guy I see in front of me.  She's like, it's him.  It's him.  He's the one.  I think he's on acid.  But I'm like, I'm worried.  I'm worried that this was a tranny dream,  because I'm writing it out,  and I was rushing this morning when I wrote it out.  I wrote it space him,  but I put the S in the wrong place.  It was shim.  I'm like, oh, my God. 
[01:06:30]  I hope this wasn't a female dream.  Shim.  Because I'm walking,  and I know that this black guy is trouble,  and I fucking,  I know that he's a problem,  and I hear him walk around  and start walking with the group I'm walking with.  I don't know who they are,  and he starts to bother this girl that I'm walking with,  and I'm like,  I know I have to step in here and say something.  So I finally say something like,  so leave her alone.  Stop bothering her,  and I punch this black guy in the face,  but he turns,  and it's a tranny. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, no.  But it's not a real face.  It's a doll face looking at me.  Oh, that's creepy.  It was a black plastic doll face,  and so I say,  is anybody going to help me here?  Is anybody going to help me?  And this white guy's looking at me,  and he's disinterested,  and he walks away.  So now I have to fight this person,  but I also have to get downtown  and see the president.  So I hop in a cab,  and when I hop in a cab,  Iraq comes over,  and he's wearing a tuxedo,  and he looks in the window, 
[01:07:30]  and I know I've missed the event  because he's holding like a fucking booklet  that I know is from the event,  and he goes,  what did he say to me?  He goes,  oh, we were in the wrong place before.  And I know he's telling me,  and I know he has photos  with both presidents,  and I know I've missed the event  because this asshole is smiling  and beaming,  and I'm like,  I should have just stuck with E-Rod.  And so I get in the cab,  and I tell the guy,  we have to go to Fifth and Beam,  and he's running red lights for me,  and then I realize 
[01:08:00]  we're driving down suburban roads,  and this is the wrong place.  You're not in the city.  But now I wonder if it's a drinking dream  because Fifth and Beam,  was I thinking Fifth and Jim Beam?  Oh.  Or was that a drunk dream?  I don't know what that was,  and then I woke up.  That was my entire dream.  That is so fucked up.  I like the detail of the plastic face.  The plastic doll face  with, like, girl doll hair,  and E-Rod in his tuxedo,  and I knew that he had photos.  Oh, and Opie's mention was,  I remember saying,  I wanted to tell George Bush  that Opie has a picture with Clinton, 
[01:08:30]  so I want to get a picture  with both of you guys  so I have a better picture than Opie.  Like, I wanted to tell this  to George Bush.  Wow.  That's a real thing  between me and Jimmy.  I bust them all the time  that I have a much better picture  than he is.  But I wanted to tell the president,  but it was fucking,  the frustration of seeing this girl  and, like, giving her 20,  it was so weird,  she had to go to the coffee shop  and needed money,  but the frustration  of not being heard by this woman,  her not hearing,  it's all hookers,  it's a weird sex drinking dream  deep down. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, you think that was?  Yeah.  What it was?  I don't know what it means.  Coke Logic's got to animate  the Jimmy dream.  I don't know what it means,  but E-Rod in his tuxedo,  I knew that he had pictures  with the presidents,  and I'm like,  why didn't I just,  it's almost like I feel like  I'm missing out on life.  By doing all this sexual shit,  because I was trying to give  this girl my number,  and I gave her money,  but meanwhile I'm missing  You're missing what you want to do.  The event.  I'm missing the event.  The big, the big thing.  It really shook me  when I woke up, though.  I couldn't go back to sleep.  I was really bothered.  That's weird, yeah. 
[01:09:30]  Might mean nothing.  Yeah.  There's a lot of meaning in there.  I don't know.  Picture taking,  and I think it's,  I don't know.  Are dreams really like...  You're constantly chasing something  that's just out of reach.  Do you look at dreams like that  and get so deep into them,  or are they very just  surface-oriented,  synapse fucking snapping?  I think they're nonsense,  because I think,  first of all,  you can't,  you know,  when people read your dreams,  it's stupid,  because you don't even remember  all of the dream.  You only remember  certain little,  tiny little things.  Very, very rough.  That's pretty detailed, 
[01:10:00]  because you...  No, I know, Jimmy.  That is really good.  Because he was able  to get out of bed.  Most people wouldn't  get out of bed,  and then they would try  to tell someone  what their dream was about.  Yeah.  And that person will go,  well, I know exactly  what's going on in your life  because of what you told me.  I try to just go  right back to sleep  and continue.  I thought of that, too.  Yeah.  I'm not even thinking  why I have this picture obsession.  I don't know if I talked  about this,  but I told you,  I wrote about it  in Happy Endings  when I was a kid.  I had that crush  on that girl.  Like, I loved her, 
[01:10:30]  and I didn't know...  We got caught  fooling her under  the blanket kissing,  but I don't remember  what happened.  But she was moving,  and my parents were like,  go say goodbye to her,  go say goodbye to her,  and I couldn't say goodbye to her.  I couldn't do it.  I just froze in my house,  and I looked at my clothes  all folded,  and I couldn't do it.  So I went down,  and she had already left.  So I never saw her again  after that, never.  But I always wondered  if capturing these celebrity moments,  it's almost like  with ex-girlfriends  or whatever,  I always keep them around,  even as friends.  Like, I can't let go.  And it's almost like  because I missed  this fucking thing, 
[01:11:00]  I can't...  I have to capture it  and fucking corral it  and keep it.  Because I've never forgotten  that moment  of looking at those clothes,  and I joked about it  in my book,  but seeing that fucking  folded pile of clothes  and not being able  to get dressed,  not being able  to move myself  and go say goodbye  to that girl.  Why couldn't you?  Like, why couldn't you?  I just...  I couldn't...  It was too sad.  It was if I don't acknowledge  it, it won't be true.  Yeah.  I couldn't...  How old were you?  Maybe five or six.  It was a puppy love 
[01:11:30]  crush thing.  It wasn't sexual.  It was like,  I don't remember her name  or what she looked like.  Well, we've talked about this.  That's hardcore sex  for a five-year-old.  Oh, boy.  It's that same emotion.  Yeah.  Same intensity.  Not having sex  as a five-year-old,  but that's...  It's the same type of shit  in your head, though.  Oh, yeah.  I think I was...  I was really in love  with someone.  Hanging around with exes.  Get the fuck out of it.  No, but not even  hanging around with them.  But just knowing  that I can occasionally  corral them.  Even as friends,  like, I don't want  to fuck them.  I don't fuck  my ex-girlfriends, ever.  Or just having them 
[01:12:00]  around still in some way?  Fuck that.  But there's one  from 10 years ago  who I think is mad at me  and she won't talk  to me anymore.  Yeah, and I don't know why.  But I'm like,  I'm curious.  Like, how is she doing?  I don't want to date her.  I don't want to fuck her.  But I just want to know  how she is.  I don't know why  I can't just go  fuck these people  and put them out  of my life anymore.  Like, why do I have  to capture every moment  on...  It's almost like  when I meet these celebrities,  I don't bother them.  I really don't want  to go hang out with them.  I don't...  Cool.  I have fucking  some of their numbers. 
[01:12:30]  I have fucking  Omar's number.  Jamie Hector.  I've texted them  a couple of times.  Like, hey,  if you want to come  down to the cellar.  But not incessantly.  I don't need them  in my life  being best friends.  I don't try to  overtake their lives.  Why do I corral  these fucking moments?  Yeah, but some of those guys  want to be friends with you.  Some of them do.  Just on a real level,  too, by the way.  Not because, you know,  you're famous  and he's famous.  I think some of them  might want to.  It's the worst  of the Opie and Anthony  show.  Big story.  They keep jacking up  the gas prices  and the news  is just biting.  Yeah, they're just  loving this.  Biting like dumb fish. 
[01:13:00]  I told you right  before the show started,  if I owned a gas station,  I would be $10 a gallon guy  so every fucking media outlet  comes to my gas station  and everyone could call  me the big asshole.  You would have  all the news there  and this gas station  charging $10 a gallon.  And they'd be trying  to interview you.  You'd just be going,  I don't want to talk to you.  There's got to be a guy  out there that owns  a gas station  that listens to the show.  I know that's almost 
[01:13:30]  an impossible thing,  but I think there has  to be one.  Raise your prices  to $10  and call the media.  You'll have everybody there.  Everyone will be there.  Great advertising.  Because some asshole  did $4.97 here  in New York City.  Guess what?  That's where the media  is hanging out today.  That's where they are.  They're hanging out  at the place  that has the highest  gas prices.  The high prices.  Free advertising for you.  Yeah.  This guy,  I guess he has a podium  in the back of his Subaru.  So wherever he goes,  he can look official. 
[01:14:00]  So you got this asshole.  He's a politician.  You don't even know his name.  And he's like,  rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph and about gas prices  as he stands behind a podium  in front of the pumps.  Yeah, he put his podium  right where your car pulls up.  So the pumps are behind him.  And then he's got  his cronies too.  Yeah.  You can't just go  to the podium by yourself.  Right.  You need some cronies  next to you.  And you're talking  to the mic  about high gas prices.  But isn't that embarrassing? 
[01:14:30]  Like his people  have to pull out the podium  from some trunk.  Set the podium up.  Set the podium up  for this asshole.  On some big oil stain  in the middle  of the fucking lane  that you get gas in.  Got oil on his podium.  Then he has some  kind of weird seal.  I don't even know  what it means.  The seal of the great  fucking county of shit.  Right.  He's just standing there  yapping about high gas prices  with no ability  to do anything about it.  No.  You know who the biggest  asshole is in the area  as far as promoting 
[01:15:00]  themselves goes?  Who's that?  Chuck Schumer.  Chuck Schumer.  I've mentioned this  a few times  and it happened again  and I haven't brought it up  on the show.  What did he inject  himself into?  Just a parade, man.  Oh, yeah.  It was the St. Paddy's  Day Parade in Huntington.  I know this is a little old  but now that we're talking  about podiums  and politicians  that are high and mighty,  this fucking asshole  walks down the middle  of the parade route  with his people  with huge signs  that just say  Chuck Schumer.  But they're his cronies.  And then some 
[01:15:30]  of the signs say  meet Chuck Schumer.  Oh.  And some of the signs  I've seen in the past  have an arrow  pointing to Chuck Schumer.  Like no one knows  what he looks like?  The guy shoves his face  in front of every camera  that's ever turned on.  But shouldn't he just  walk the parade route  and people should know  who he is?  Yeah, it's like,  hey, look, it's Chuck Schumer.  And if you don't know,  oh, well.  Oh, well.  But no, he wants everyone  to make sure  you're looking at Chuck Schumer.  Well, for so many years  we didn't know  what he looked like  because his head  was buried so far  up Hillary's ass. 
[01:16:00]  He finally pulled it out  and we're like,  oh, that's what he looks like.  That's pretty good.  Very new.  Yeah.  So I bet you  he drives around  with a podium.  Yeah, he seems  like a podium guy.  I want a podium.  I'm just going to put  one of those escalate.  And just set it up?  Because then  no matter what you're saying  it seems important.  Fuck, that could be  a good video.  So you could just  pop a podium out  and just start talking  to people.  About some kind of issue?  And it doesn't even  have to be anything  but you got a podium  so it looks really important.  Have a seal made up? 
[01:16:30]  Right.  Some seal that means nothing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well,  shock jockery.  Some crest on it?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you need a crest  on your podium?  Yeah, you need a bird  and some like stars  and shit.  Some twiggy looking thing?  Like a twig?  Like a twig?  The bird's got  to hold a twig.  Yeah, and then you talk  and people are like,  holy shit,  this guy means business.  That's right.  Well, now when you see  the podium on TV,  you'll have a little chuckle.  Fucking asshole  driving around town  with his own podium 
[01:17:00]  so he can say some shit.  That's ridiculous.  Look at that.  And he punches up  some podiums.  Can we buy a podium?  Oh, man.  Oh, what kind of podium  you want to buy?  I want a podium.  Wait, I want that small one  where you just put all the...  No, I like the podiums actually.  No, I'm going to back up.  Full wood.  I like the podiums  that hide your entire body  because then you feel  like you're almost in a womb.  Yeah, like that's a good podium.  Yeah, I hate the podiums that have...  $2,000.  That's a good one though.  Yeah, see, I like that.  I like the big blocky podiums 
[01:17:30]  because you can hide  your body behind it.  And you can put a lot  of microphones in front of you.  Those stupid podiums,  what are they called?  Where it's just like  a little shelf  and then like just a little pole.  Oh, no, that sucks.  Yeah, you can't hide behind that shit.  You can't hide.  You need to be able to hide.  People will be looking  at your cock bulge  when you're trying  to say something important.  Yeah, not paying attention  to what you're saying.  I'm going to get a podium.  $1,025 for a podium  with no shit on it?  But you're saving $4.55.  I don't know.  Oh, is it assembled?  We passed the savings on you. 
[01:18:00]  It was like an Ikea podium  where I got to put  that motherfucker together.  Anything worse  than putting shit together.  Oh, stop.  Who's helping you  take this out of the car?  It's 150 pounds.  That's 150 pounds?  So that asshole  that was in front  of the gas station,  it's safe to say  his podium could be  up to 150 pounds?  That's what his cronies do.  Potentially, sure.  Oh, my God.  Oh, but that's  a good podium  right there.  I think I need that.  I'm going to look  cherry.  Cherry's nice.  Cherrywood podium.  You're an oak man?  I think so.  You're an oak man there. 
[01:18:30]  Jimmy?  I like the cherry wood.  Well, no,  that's kind of...  My buddy Jimmy  at Toluca Lake  needs a podium.  Oak's nice.  Well, now we're down  to $600 for a podium.  Yeah, $600.  Yeah, this one's $160.  Does it look cheap,  though, the podium?  The picture really sucks  on this one.  Yeah, that kind of  looks a little cheesy.  That looks a little cheap, man.  We want something  that looks like  fucking solid oak.  There is room for papers  to put on the podium.  Well, let me see.  That's a little thin.  It is a little thin.  Yeah, but you can hide 
[01:19:00]  your body behind it.  But look, that one comes  with one of those  little reading lamps.  Oh, and a mic stand?  Yeah, it's pretty serious.  And a mic stand.  That's not bad.  That looks damn official  right there.  It's got three and a half stars.  No, look, not enough room.  It's small.  There's an actual business.  Where'd you go?  Podium.com?  Yeah, it's like fucking...  I pumped in podiums  into Google Shopping.  Google Shopping podiums.  The last one  we were just looking at  was from Sears.  I didn't know Sears  had a podium section.  Sears sells a podium?  They sure do  because I already went to...  I saw two of them already.  Holy shit. 
[01:19:30]  Fucking podiums.  Why are we talking  about podiums?  Because they're cool  and we're going to do  some fun bits with them.  Very important.  Guests are pushing 450  and we're talking  about podiums.  Damn.  The price of podiums  have risen steadily  over the years.  That's true.  I mean, look at these prices.  It's ridiculous.  I would like to get a podium  and discuss the high price  of podiums.  That would...  Wow, that one's $3,500.  I know, right?  What do you get for that?  Yes, it is, though.  Does it suck your dick?  But I wouldn't be...  Are you making your speech?  There's a little hole in it.  There's a glory hole. 
[01:20:00]  There's an oversized  reading surface  that holds a three-ring binder,  heavy-duty industrial casters  for easy mobility.  Oh, man.  I say the casters.  How much does it weigh, though?  Because if you don't have  your cronies with you,  you're going to look silly  trying to haul out...  Trying to haul it out.  ...haul your 200-pound podium  out of the trunk.  You don't have to press there  when you're doing that.  To say some shit.  Look silly.  I bet shipping has to suck  on something.  Oh, my God.  Big and heavy.  Yeah, well,  we'll get in front of the podium  and talk about the high cost  of shipping of podiums.  Anything with podium... 
[01:20:30]  Anything podium-related.  I can't even say podium anymore.  It sounds funny.  You boys need teleprompters  to go with these podiums.  No.  Can we get one of those  invisible teleprompters?  The glass?  Yeah, it's right in front of you  and no one knows  what's on there.  It's tilted.  Yeah.  I would like that.  You don't see it,  but they can see it.  Obama uses those all the time.  Rocco's got a great idea.  You would look like  the biggest asshole.  Go ahead, Rocco. 
[01:21:00]  That's funny.  Please deliver this properly  because I gave it a lot.  Okay, here we go, guys.  I'm thinking about putting  the cop on a Segway  and then having a podium  around the Segway  and he can go around  in Times Square  and just spill his venom  at everyone that has anything.  And would you be  Segway podium guy?  That would be great.  Where you go from place to place  where you just go  on your Segway,  you can then stop  and give a speech. 
[01:21:30]  And as soon as the Segway stops,  it is instant podium.  Now you're a podium.  And then you just Segway your ass  to another location?  This could be  the strangest opening  to an O.P. Anthony show.  When I drove in today,  I wasn't thinking podiums  whatsoever.  But then you see that asshole  in front of the gas station  with his dumb podium.  I'm thinking,  hey, we got something here.  Because we were just thinking  logistically, it's silly.  A gas station,  you don't ask the gas station guy,  excuse me,  do you have a podium in there?  Right.  Just in case someone wants  to give a speech  at your gas station.  You've got to bring  the motherfucker.  Well, when you set up 
[01:22:00]  that podium  and the people around  are going,  People will respond.  Are going,  holy shit,  some stuff is going  to be said today  right here.  If you're just talking,  right?  Yeah.  People aren't really  going to pay you  no never mind.  No.  But if you have a podium  in front of you,  now you're saying  something important.  People are going  to stop and listen.  You want to talk  to a guy that actually,  this is his gig.  What?  He rents out podiums.  Derek.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  I'm Beth Anthony. 
[01:22:30]  How you doing?  Oh, bless you.  This is,  this is,  It's not the only thing  I do,  but I work for a company.  We,  we rent podiums.  We set it up.  We have to deal  with these political assholes.  It's never them.  It's always a group of people.  I'll give you a great example.  My company did a lot of work  for Cuomo  when he was attorney general.  And, you know,  this guy's like,  Hey,  I want to speak  at this school  and I want a podium.  I want some blue drape  and I want a fucking,  you know,  model holding a bird,  whatever.  We got to come up 
[01:23:00]  with that shit.  Oh,  so you're the one  that comes up  with the background  and everything,  huh?  Oh, wow.  So,  so,  so they just,  they have us  lugging around.  Yeah,  I got you.  So they call you  and then give you  some specs  and then you have to  fucking set up  the whole thing  for the guy.  Oh, yeah.  So someone out  in Long Island  set up that podium  for that politician.  But what about  the seal on the front?  They usually come up  with that,  but there's always,  they always have  a group of people.  Like you said,  they always have  a group of cronies  and they're always like,  uh,  could you put it 
[01:23:30]  a little to the left?  Yeah,  could you put it  a little to the left?  Very important.  Podium placement.  Very important.  You want to make sure  fucking where the mics go,  how high the mics are.  I don't want it  blocking my face.  Well,  of course not.  I know,  it's a fucking  thankless job.  Now,  someone is suggesting  we need a gavel too.  For what?  Do you gavel  when you set up a podium?  No,  I don't think you gavel  a podium.  You don't gavel  a podium,  no.  No,  you just use your voice.  You can't get carried away.  Do you go with the microphone 
[01:24:00]  and then they have to set up  the little speakers  or you just talk loud enough?  I think you have the microphone  but it's recording something.  Or do you have an area  on your podium  where all the local news stations  and radio stations  put their flags up?  And they throw the mics  with the flags on them  and then you talk.  Okay,  I think that's what we mean.  But you talk loud.  You gotta have that politician talk  where gas prices  must come down.  You gotta pound your fist.  Yeah,  pound the podium.  So you need something  that sounds good  when you pound it. 
[01:24:30]  And the podium's gotta be,  you know,  it can't be particle board podium.  You need a poundable podium.  That's fantastic.  Well,  you know,  I mean,  the guy's setting up his podium  to talk about gas prices  and I've never seen that asshole  before in my life.  Oh,  fuck,  you know what?  We are fucking up  this whole thing  according to Eric.  Eric,  go ahead.  Hey,  guys.  Hey.  Isn't an elect turn  a thing you stand behind  not a podium?  Uh-oh,  is there a difference  between a lectern  and a podium?  Yeah,  a podium is where you stand  on top of it. 
[01:25:00]  It's like a stage.  No,  we were seeing  podiums.  No,  we went to podium.com  and they shared  a lectern.  What's a lectern?  What's the difference  between a lectern?  Okay,  a lectern  is a shitty podium.  It's a shitty podium.  A lectern is more like  just,  it has a spot  for paper  on top  that you read  in front of,  but it looks very narrow  for the most part.  They do make thick lecterns,  but I think that's more  for giving a lecture  at a,  in a college 
[01:25:30]  or something.  Yeah,  for a gas station.  Uh,  no,  no,  podium,  podium better  than lectern.  Yeah,  you know when you're  looking at a podium.  Oh,  that's the ruling?  Yeah,  lecterns suck a dick.  I wasn't sure,  I'm sorry.  Lecterns are for  valedictorians,  who needs that shit?  Yes,  yes.  Well,  what about a salutatorian?  Could you use  lectern or no?  Lectern's like a music stand.  Did you say so?  Oh,  okay.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  All right,  all right.  And,  on Lady Gaga.  Yeah,  on Lady Gaga 
[01:26:00]  again in the news.  She knows how to get some news  and she never uses a podium.  No.  From what I've seen.  It's the worst of the OPN Anthony Show.  We're going to try the Johnny Ola murder  on Big A,  because you know how they do the myth busters?  It doesn't look like you could snap somebody's neck  with a wooden hanger.  That fucking bottom part is pretty frail.  Yeah,  so I'm going to try and murder Big A  on the next show.  Johnny Ola?  Yeah,  I'm going to see if that'll work.  Otto's a huge fan of Big A.  Johnny Ola was killed with the hanger, 
[01:26:30]  or he killed somebody.  He was killed with it.  It was the bodyguard,  the old man bodyguard.  Yeah,  the other guy didn't even have a name.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Was it Rocco Lampone or no?  Yeah.  The bodyguard?  I don't remember,  but when they told Michael,  your bodyguard is dead,  he had no reaction.  He just went,  so what'd you get my kid for Christmas?  It's like,  no feeling.  I'm glad I'm here with movie aficionados.  Yes.  Here's a quick,  before you go,  five minutes left.  Yeah.  Godfather question.  Yeah.  Original Godfather.  Okay.  How did, 
[01:27:00]  and this is not a quiz,  but how did,  uh,  uh,  uh,  the father,  uh,  Don Colleone?  How did he know after that meeting when he said,  I did not know to this day that it was Barzini?  How did he know what happened in the meeting for him to know that it was Barzini the whole time?  I knew he said it and he figured it out,  but what,  what instance happened for you to,  for you to go back and go,  oh,  this is what happened for him to know. 
[01:27:30]  That was probably the one question everyone fucking has.  I think it was him,  the way Barzini manipulated the meeting and,  uh,  and ran the meeting and made it happen.  I think the,  what Barzini just,  he was just a smart guy.  And it was too agreeable.  And he was like,  uh,  too agreeable.  And he said,  a refusal is not the act of a friend.  Yeah.  Uh,  if he has them,  he must share them.  Yeah.  And I think that was probably it.  It was probably that subtle way.  He led that meeting.  Yeah.  And got Don Colleone to concede his point.  Right.  Yeah.  He had been fighting with to tell you about.  And I think that's,  so it was never a moment. 
[01:28:00]  It just was an overall scene.  Yeah.  Perceptive.  A mobster hunch.  Yeah.  That he knew from,  you know,  growing up.  Watch the Godfather too.  And those guys just on a,  maybe that you're doing something.  On a maybe,  right,  right.  You know,  better,  better,  better.  I didn't know until this day.  Well,  I kind of know.  Yeah.  Fuck him anyway.  Yeah.  He didn't pass the ketchup that one time.  So fuck you.  Why take a chance?  Yeah.  But he said,  he said,  uh,  he goes,  he could charge for these services. 
[01:28:30]  He's not,  we're not communists.  I think just the way he led it and made it happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tipped him off.  Yeah.  Good enough.  That helps me to watch it again.  And wanted the drugs done.  I think it also said that Bartini wanted the drugs sold.  Yeah.  Um,  because I think some real greaseball shit.  He might've thought that Bartini would side with him on no drugs.  Right.  Um,  but when Bartini said that,  that indicated that he was on the side of the drugs being sold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But didn't he kill,  but didn't he kill any,  everybody anyway?  Yeah.  They ran up killing everybody, 
[01:29:00]  right?  Michael did.  And he knew he could make that,  that swear that oath.  And Michael would do it.  He knew Michael would do it.  Yeah.  Don Corleone didn't have to do it.  Even Stracci,  who I have no idea who the fuck that was.  Stracci,  when he tells him,  Stracci,  who's that?  What?  Me,  I thought he was all itching.  Stracci,  you're fucking Stracci.  I bet Stracci's going through the names,  and he's Stracci,  you're like,  who?  Who the fuck was Stracci?  Yeah,  he probably killed him on a horse's head.  So,  it was no definitive thing that happened then? 
[01:29:30]  No.  No,  I don't think there was one moment where they,  it wasn't such a blatant thing.  I think it would have been corny if it was this blatant clip.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  Where he looked and curled his mustache and his fingers.  Well,  he had his fingers crossed.  He had the pieces there.  When Michael found out Fredo did it,  it was kind of a moment of,  dun,  dun,  like,  that happened.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  It wasn't like,  oh shit.  It was like,  he fucked up,  he lied.  So,  I thought it was maybe a moment there when he fucked up.  Johnny Ola took me here.  Johnny Ola showed me.  What an asshole Fredo is. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  No,  no,  we never met.  I never met.  No,  no.  And then like five minutes later,  oh,  me and Johnny Ola.  Johnny comes here all the time.  What an idiot.  Fucking dummy beluga whale far-headed fuck.  Then Michael,  then Michael kissed him.  I was like,  what,  he's still getting fresh?  All right.  It's fucking Friday.  I ain't putting up with this shit.  Well,  we're going to switch gears,  Danny.  What's this deposition thing about? 
[01:30:30]  Depositions are supposed to be very private.  They are.  And this gentleman was being videotaped and they had some odd questions for him.  And this was on,  found on the,  I believe it was the Huffington Post this morning.  I'll get more backstory as we listen to the clip so I can properly explain this.  Okay.  Do you sound like the testimony you're about to give away the truth?  The whole truth and nothing but the truth is to help you guys.  Yes,  I do.  Could you please give us your name? 
[01:31:00]  Jeffrey Epstein.  Is it true,  sir,  that,  um,  you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis?  What the fuck?  What is that?  An egg-shaped,  an egg-shaped penis.  Keep fucking those chickens.  He's a disgraced money manager and former Clinton associate.  This was a deposition earlier this month.  He was there because he's facing a claim from a 15-year-old girl who says, 
[01:31:30]  among other things,  that he promised to pay her $200 for a massage.  Oh,  no.  Oh,  his nickname was Old Omelet Shorts.  That's right.  With him,  when he fucks,  it's not rape,  it's a poaching.  I hope you like yours runny.  That's right.  That's what he says when he's about to come.  I'm going to scramble your pussy.  Fucking awful.  The girl was too young to realize that it was cum and not egg whites.  Oh, 
[01:32:00]  just an egg white omelet.  Here you go.  He pulls his dick out.  He's got little bits of ham and fucking onion on it.  Easter's fun.  Hey,  fucking vinegar smelling balls.  How do you have an egg-shaped dick?  He puts it in a slipper and a kid grabs it.  He hides it.  I get it.  Yes,  we get it.  Let's continue.  Make like your dick and beat it.  Is it true,  sir,  that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis? 
[01:32:30]  But it don't fall down?  Yes.  Sorry.  Is it true that your dick once sat on a wall  and had a great fall?  Is it true that your dick stands up straight on the summer solstice?  Is it true,  sir,  that you have what's been described as an egg-shaped penis?  Form vague indefinite,  and I'm going to give you the first warning, Mr. Cuban, 
[01:33:00]  that these types of questions are not only argumentative,  but directed in a manner to embarrass Mr. Epstein.  If you continue with this type of question,  I'll adjourn the deposition immediately.  All right.  Sir,  according to the police department's probable cause affidavit,  one witness described your penis as oval-shaped  and claimed when erect,  it was thick towards the bottom,  but was thin and small towards the head portion. 
[01:33:30]  Oh,  that's fucking great.  Oh,  what a fuck.  He's got a rocket penis.  Did the Egyptians build your penis and leave it in the desert?  He's got a rocket ship for a penis.  He does.  Jesus.  Oh,  how embarrassing.  A big fat base and a little teensky head.  Is your penis shaped like Kenneth Fetter?  It's a soft egg shaped penis.  And then it gets hard and it's a fucking drill. 
[01:34:00]  Why don't we go to Tim in Georgia?  Tim,  you got something on this?  Yeah,  I was going to say that massage didn't go over easy.  Oh,  what came first?  The chicken or your penis?  That was actually one of the comments in the,  in the FARC friend.  Was it?  I would not eat your penis and ham.  I would not eat it.  Sam,  I am.  When women suck your penis,  do they always rub toast over it first?  We'd like an answer,  sir.  These questions are guaranteed to embarrass my client, 
[01:34:30]  Chicken Little.  There's no reason to ask this.  Would your penis look natural on a plate at Denny's?  Did you give her the old grand slam?  Here's a great line.  No credit because I don't have a name with this one.  He wanted to bang her ass,  so he turned her over easy.  You want to hear that description?  Oh God,  more than I want anything.  I just described your penis as oval shaped and claim when erect,  it was thick towards the bottom, 
[01:35:00]  but was thin and small towards the head portion and called it egg shaped.  Those are not my words.  I apologize.  But as Mr.  Now adjourned.  As Mr.  Critton has stated that this is a...  Court is now adjourned.  I'm willing to continue.  I'm willing to continue.  Wow.  That judge...  What the fuck?  I guess the judge was just like,  Court adjourned.  Judge is getting a rod.  He didn't want to...  He wants to get down there and eat some eggs.  He wants to see what that looks like.  Who is old egg dick?  I have to see him.  They're calling him Old Traffic Cone Cops. 
[01:35:30]  That's the guy?  Does your penis look like a candy corn?  Sirius X.  It's the OPN Anthony Show.  We're back.  Stupid Anthony is not feeling well.  And I'm really hoping it's that dumb restaurant  that he fucking raved about for an hour. 
[01:36:00]  This fancy meal.  I hope he's shitting his pants.  The homeless guy was just trying to save on the shits.  I bet you the homeless guy is feeling great right now.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful thing.  What did he eat?  Did he say?  No, it wasn't you.  It was a rich...  Oh, brother.  Oh, God.  You gave him the shits?  No, but I don't know.  He's saying that Anthony didn't eat his...  He meant you, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Who did he eat you?  Because you're...  I don't know.  I'm poisonous.  My vagina is poisonous.  How would you know? 
[01:36:30]  I don't fucking read the internet.  I've been around that area for...  Carved in the wall of the internet.  I bet he's got that stomach virus.  We had it...  Did you have the stomach virus yet?  The norovirus of each other.  Holy fuck.  I bet that's what he's got is that stomach virus.  And he's contagious for up to two weeks,  so you're probably going to get it now.  Oh, fuck.  I hope not.  It's fucking...  You just lay in bed puking and shitting. 
[01:37:00]  Have I had it?  No, I don't think so.  I would have known on your stomach.  You don't remember?  Wait, there was a few days I was puking and shitting.  I took the flu shot this year.  No, so did I.  This is a whole nother strain.  What did you take for the virus?  What did I...  We knocked it and I fucking...  I last two weeks ago.  For two weeks?  No, I had it two weeks ago.  No, no, it only really lasts like about 48 hours.  And I was laying...  I woke up...  I ate all this Italian food Friday night at the place I was working. 
[01:37:30]  Then I was supposed to be at Mahegan Sun Saturday,  and I woke up at 5.30 in the morning,  and I go, huh?  Do I have food poisoning?  And I just started pu...  I mean, not like little pu...  It came flying out.  I'll describe it.  Yeah.  It came flying out.  And then I shit...  I mean, that felt good because I...  I'll describe it.  So I was told...  I called her.  I go, I'm fucking...  You know, how am I going to get to Mahegan Sun?  I'm not going to be able to...  I'm going to have to cancel on the same day.  Then I go, I need the money.  And then she calls me back two hours later. 
[01:38:00]  She's puking.  My daughter...  And then we found out that my youngest daughter was the host.  She brought it from preschool.  She...  She came home.  She threw up once.  She goes, I just threw up in the toilet.  And I went and I inspected it, you know,  because that's what moms do.  And then I said, oh, you want to lay down?  Or...  She goes, no, I'll have lunch.  And then we went to Chuck E. Cheese.  And everybody else...  That's all...  That's all...  For her, that's...  So I bet he has...  For ten minutes of sickness.  Yeah.  I just don't want to get it.  That's...  Let's be honest.  That's all that matters is that I don't get sick. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  That's...  It's fucking horrible.  You got...  You know, you got to cancel everything.  Do you cancel it again?  No.  I want to say...  I thought I was going to...  I kept a puke bucket right next to the...  I've done that before, too.  A couple of times where I have a little thing in the back.  What's that?  I heard you.  Oh, my God.  Where you felt you...  He thought that about himself, but he waited until he could say it about you.  Did you feel like you were going to throw up on the audience?  No.  I kept a puke bucket there just because I wanted to have a conversation starter.  Yeah.  Of course.  Stupid.  Where do you bail out of the conversation? 
[01:39:00]  I'm bonding with you.  Like, you're like, yeah, I had a puke bucket.  I'm like, me too.  Why?  Did you think you were going to puke?  No.  No reason.  I just wanted to have a story.  No, but I don't understand.  Like, why were you saying what was wrong?  I don't know.  In 21 years, do you understand if I had the flu or something?  It was like one of those.  I was a bad idea.  No, he's not saying this is recent.  He said, I've also had that happen to me in the past.  Don't act like I don't know what the fuck's going on.  You don't know what's going on.  You're 100 years old.  Your brain is going.  It happens. 
[01:39:30]  You didn't have much to begin with.  So it's probably going to be a pretty quick slide.  The Alzheimer's is going to be a very, very quick jump.  We won't even know for years.  No, he's always been dumb.  You even said last night how dumb you are.  I admit that I'm dumb.  That's why I married you because I seem smart by comparison.  Fucking.  Ugh.  I'm there.  Good luck.  Fucking 80 years in the business and that's his comeback.  Ugh. 
[01:40:00]  Nice.  I want to hear your podcast.  I haven't heard it.  Huh?  I haven't heard your podcast.  I hate doing it.  Do you?  I hate doing it, yeah.  Why?  I, a lot of reasons.  One, I don't like talking to Rich for an hour.  That one's true.  Even though people like it, you hate doing it?  Yeah, because it's, we actually fight.  Like, for some reason, we're the kind of people that can't pretend.  So you have to fight once and we can wait.  So we really have an argument and then I get emotional and sometimes I have to lay on the  bed for like half an hour after the podcast.  Because you're fucking, you're, you're, because you're close-minded and you're, you don't know 
[01:40:30]  how to compromise or rationalize and you know, you fucking.  That is unequivocally not true.  And you fucking, the other day we do a podcast, she has all morning to eat a granola bar and  then we start to, she's chewing on a granola bar and it's so fucking aggravating.  It's awful.  It's like almost as bad as Nicorette gum on the air.  Oh God, I know.  What do you eat a, what do you eat a granola bar for?  It really is like the horse calling the kettle black. 
[01:41:00]  It's not, it's not the same.  So, and, and, you know, it's just, you do it and, but we don't, you don't have any fucking,  and one, we do it like four or five days before it comes out.  So you can't do any topical because it's already been done.  You know what I mean?  If you, if we talk about what's going on.  Yeah, but you wouldn't want to do topical, would you?  No.  Isn't that the whole theme? 
[01:41:30]  Who is that guy?  It's your relationship?  My name is Sam.  No, Sam.  It's, it's not that he wants to talk about his gigs.  He thinks people want to know the behind the scenes.  And so he'll tell these like excruciatingly boring stories.  Are they bad stories?  Stories.  Yeah, no.  I mean, it is like, remember that time you were talking about all the seafood restaurants  that you did stand up at in, in Florida or something.  I mean, it went on forever.  And then I was like, this is, we don't need all this. 
[01:42:00]  No, a lot of people like behind the scenes, what they want to know what's going on.  They want show business, not like, then I went to a seafood restaurant and did stand up.  That's all you do is read magazines about show business.  So I'm giving them the answer.  Yeah, but that's that show business.  Yeah, that's just a fucking boring salesman on the road.  I was trashing some of the places that do comedy and, and, and, and the comedy scene.  Like the other day on Twitter, just yesterday, somebody, uh, this comedy club that I don't 
[01:42:30]  work in Indianapolis said, it was probably a massive, like a tweet.  Hey, uh, come down and win free tickets.  I go, why would I want to come to that shithole?  They ripped me off for fucking like 700, $800.  Why were you scheduled to work a month there?  Really?  Boom.  Oh, oh, oh, that's really just take any side you can against me.  That's why.  So, and you're the, one of the reasons I don't work anymore, because they said you were bombing 
[01:43:00]  all week.  Remember at Crackers, where they told you to wear the makeup, when we were going to  do radio, they said, look pretty.  Oh, at Crackers, where was that?  In Indianapolis.  In Indianapolis.  I do remember.  Was it a lady?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She took me into the, her office and like, explained to me how to do radio.  That's show business.  Literally.  That's what Rich was talking about.  She told her you to wear makeup.  She goes, look pretty.  These guys, you know, they like a pretty woman to look at in the morning. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  That was it.  Yes.  Yeah.  I go, why don't we bring in Bonnie?  This is the only phase of God.  I'm sorry.  So, so, I, the Twitter, see these people, they go behind fake characters.  And so, the, the tweet was, come, come out to this place, club.  I go, why the fuck would I want to go there?  Then he writes back, the person writes back, who's this?  I go, I'm a guy that the club ripped off.  It's good.  The club is good.  Oh, I read that.  I didn't understand.  The club was good.  So, then somebody else writes back, uh, ha ha, why this is funny, because he's miserable 
[01:44:00]  and his career's going nowhere.  I go, well, you're, you're not even a real person.  You don't even have a real name.  Well, you know, it's probably some fucking local open miker that's kissing ass to the club.  Yeah.  You know.  This happened on Twitter?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He has a, yeah.  The funny thing about your, your tweets is that it's almost like, uh, some kind of, like,  a, a puzzle or word game, because there's no, there's no punctuation and half the words  are spelled wrong. 
[01:44:30]  So, you spend a lot of time, like, deciphering what you actually mean, you know?  Because I remember reading that tweet and it took me a long time to understand what was  happening.  Voss, do you worry that people won't pick up on the nuances because you don't have  commas and stuff?  Well, because you don't, you don't want to waste the characters.  You only have 140.  So, you fucking try to squeeze everything.  Do you use all 140 characters?  I try to get to 140.  I try to get my money's worth.  I try to, yeah.  Every good tweet should be exactly 140 characters. 
[01:45:00]  140 characters.  Yes.  With or without the period?  Do you count the period at the end?  He doesn't use any.  Oh, you don't put it?  No.  It's the end.  So, they know there should be a period there.  They don't just sit and wait for another, you know, it's the end.  I'm not calling.  I don't do 400 tweets in a row.  Okay?  I'm not doing a novel.  Can you take the gum on your upper lip?  It's fucking making me want to punch you in the face so bad.  Oh, yeah.  Now you know my life.  Every fucking day I look at you.  I want to hit you so far.  I want you to hit me.  I want to hit you.  Give me a reason.  I fucking would.  I wanted to belt you the other night.  Why'd you want to hit her? 
[01:45:30]  Because we're fucking laying in bed, going to bed, and, oh, I'm sorry.  I farted.  He woke me up.  No, okay, wait.  I fell asleep.  He farted and woke me up.  That's how loud it was.  And then he wouldn't say sorry.  Who says sorry?  Who says sorry for farting?  He said sorry I woke you up.  No.  You just be nice.  No.  He had to fight and argue.  Yeah, no, you.  I go, you woke me up.  No, I didn't.  I go, you just farted and woke me up.  No, I didn't.  He denied waking you up as you were awake talking to him with your eyes open. 
[01:46:00]  And the thing, who apologizes?  He thinks if he apologizes, like, his head is going to explode or something.  And then it goes.  Like, the police are going to come.  And you fucking, you're arguing.  You got to vacuum.  You got to do this and that.  And you bring up the whole fucking day of your resentment.  This is so funny.  I know, because I did.  You bring up a whole day of resentment.  But you went golfing while I did all your laundry.  He's done laundry a couple of times.  He will not do any of my laundry. 
[01:46:30]  He picks out his own clothes.  So I want to say, oh, yeah, she's got stains in her hand.  I'm doing your dirty underwear.  So I did all his laundry.  I cooked.  I cleaned.  You know, whatever.  I did my wifely duties.  It's fine.  After dinner, I was getting everything cleaned up and stuff.  I said, hey, can you just vacuum where Raina had eaten?  There was all of this stuff on the thing.  He was like, oh.  You could see it in his face, like, angrily stomps around a little bit.  And then he goes, I'll do it tomorrow. 
[01:47:00]  I go, just do it now.  It's going to take five minutes.  Oh, I'm not your slave.  I don't know how to do it.  Just tell me to do it.  Like, he literally goes off the handle.  And then eventually, you know, I have to talk to him like a child.  I'm like, just get the vacuums right there.  It'll take you five minutes.  Go ahead.  He does it, you know, the least amount that he can possibly do.  It's fine.  Good.  And then he's done.  And then he lays on the couch.  Are you implying that it's just self-centered?  I'm saying, like.  Are you implying that he paid for the vacuum and the building that you're living in to vacuum? 
[01:47:30]  But that's what it always comes down to.  Yes.  My duties are to financially.  I've moved you to the middle of New Jersey so you can't make a living.  And now I'm going to constantly use it against you.  I make a living.  I live in the middle of New Jersey.  I make a living.  Why don't you guys move somewhere in North Jersey?  Closer.  North Jersey?  Yeah.  Or closer to New York.  Because you can't sell a burnt down house.  Is it fixed yet or no?  It'll be done in, like, a month.  But even if I did sell the house right now, I'd lose, like, $40,000 fucking dollars.  This is her theory in life. 
[01:48:00]  And I would love to.  She said, sell the house, right?  Sell the house where I'd lose $40,000 easily.  Every day it goes up another $10,000.  Or $30,000, $40,000 you'd lose now in the market.  And then she said, and we'll rent in New York.  Who the fuck sells and has less than $1,000 mortgage because I paid it down, you know,  from the hard work I've done while, you know, she's out gallivanting.  And I fucking, and go rent in New York for, like, $2,000. 
[01:48:30]  And plus, we have a four-year-old.  We have good schools where we live.  You know, so you can't just move when you don't know the school system.  I know the school system.  It's good schools.  A lot of, you know.  He knows schools.  I think we can all.  You know, my other daughter's went to schools.  And, you know, my other daughter is on the dean's list in college every fucking marking period.  Okay.  So, it's good school.  No one says marking period in college, you dumb bell.  I know.  Marking period?  He's always using terms. 
[01:49:00]  Like, how old is he?  Because he uses phrases from, like, the turn of the century.  Don't poppycock.  So, you know, you got it fucking mean.  Like, you fucking, you don't have to answer to anybody.  You don't fucking, you come and go when you want.  You do what you fucking want.  He's lonely, Rich.  He's not lonely.  He fucking goes.  There's a price to pay for that.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got nobody to do his laundry.  Huh?  Wouldn't you want someone to ask you to vacuum once in a while?  I have a housekeeper. 
[01:49:30]  And I like doing my own laundry.  I do my own laundry.  Yeah.  I like it.  That's why I do my laundry.  I don't want to do anybody else's laundry.  I would do my ex-girlfriend when she would stay over, and she would leave her stuff over.  I would always, she was lazy.  She never did laundry, but I would always do hers when it was there.  Wash her stupid pants.  When we had, when we were in, here's the deal.  When we were in our house, and we had the washer and dryer, I had no problem throwing her shit in.  You know, it was right there.  But, you know, going to the laundromat.  Oh, you're going to a mat now?  Yeah, because we live in a fucking furnished apartment. 
[01:50:00]  Ew.  And it's so depressing.  Oh, I love you.  I go on the fucking road.  I go on the road, and then I come back to a furnished apartment, so it still feels like  I'm on the fucking road.  Yeah.  It's depressing.  You know, I'm working these fucking days, trying to just get by, pay bills, pay the move,  and then I got to hear her fucking vacuum.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm not a vacuumer.  Go vacuum.  Fuck it.  It's not even, you know.  Whatever.  It's not that.  It's not the vacuuming or anything.  It's the childishness.  Yeah.  With which, he goes, you're not my mom, but he puts me into that category, forces me 
[01:50:30]  into that.  No, because I'd rather bang my mom.  Because any normal person would just jump up and see what needs to be done and do it.  And everybody, you know.  That's not true.  That's not true.  I'm tired.  I'm fucking tired.  From what?  From golfing.  From just everything.  From golfing.  He golfed all day.  That doesn't.  I got up.  Does he golf a lot?  Yeah.  Every day, he's like, I got to do it today because it's, you know, it's only a nice day.  Every day, he says it.  No, here's the thing.  You don't know if it's going to be nice tomorrow.  You got to go home.  You know how tiring it is just going from city to city and fucking one week in Baltimore, 
[01:51:00]  you come home for four fucking days.  No, he has no idea.  You know, I'm just saying he's agreeing because you don't know, you know, once in a while,  you know, and which you should be on the road everywhere, once we get, you know, the  kid in school and stuff.  But.  How are you going to just leave her?  Yeah.  But you know what I'm saying.  She's just sitting there waiting for someone to pick her up for like an entire weekend.  Once she's old enough, just send her to boarding school.  And so it's just tiring, you know, and then you got the pressure of fucking this, you 
[01:51:30]  know, this dumb fucking four year movie that we thought was done.  And now it's another forty thousand fucking dollars.  Because we re-edited it.  We took it from one level and the graphics alone are seventeen thousand fucking dollars  for graphics.  And it's well worth it.  It's well worth.  But it's just so much.  And you're sitting here going, holy fuck, you got one hundred and thirty thousand dollars.  And what if I don't sell this fucking thing?  You know, you try to get to try to get to festivals and stuff. 
[01:52:00]  Well, we were we were this close.  We were to South by Southwest and one person said no.  Everybody said yes.  Yeah.  That person was me.  I said, fuck South by Southwest.  And we're kind of glad because it wasn't ready.  Right.  It wasn't the way we were.  Do you know who said no or no?  Some lady there.  You know.  Why did she say no?  Did she give you a reason?  Yes.  What did she say?  First of all, she sent an email to Rich that said that was titled, this isn't the email  you were hoping for, because I love the professionalism.  This wasn't the email you were hoping for. 
[01:52:30]  What was the reason?  Your wife's going to be with you for time.  She said it was more about me than about the topic.  The topic.  She said it was more of a venue or whatever for Bonnie.  Yeah.  A vehicle.  A vehicle for Bonnie.  A venue.  A vehicle.  You know, I'm like sometimes.  Any V word.  More of a Vincent Price.  He couldn't think of another one. 
[01:53:00]  I know.  He was reaching for Vincent, but he's like.  So, okay.  So, everybody else.  Did you read it again?  Was that a valid point she made?  No, no.  No, actually, we did change it to make it, to include more, because, you know, we got a  couple of people's opinions, Colin Quinn's and stuff, and everybody was like, I mean,  it didn't show me doing stand-up.  It didn't show, it really didn't show me hardly at all.  And they said, you should put more of you in it.  Right.  So, then we ended up actually doing the opposite of what she said. 
[01:53:30]  The first guy that saw it at South by Southwest was really very pivotal in the re-editing,  because he said, look, I'm not telling you to make these changes, but make them.  You know, and he's been doing this for over 10 years, looking at documentaries and looking at comedies.  What changes did he tell you?  Well, we moved around the beginning towards the back.  We added a couple more things of her and I.  We threw stand-up in it.  The middle kind of fell flat.  We pumped up the middle. 
[01:54:00]  We cut out Bobby Kelly.  Only half of them.  So, and the guy really knew what he was fucking talking about.  But you know what the problem with the, like, the hardest part, I think, of the documentary is it's not real.  I mean, it's real in some way, like, but it's really not like an empowered documentary,  where I think a lot of women, even female comedians, when they talk to me about it,  they feel like it's got to be that, like, where I'm really going.  No, women are funnier than men, which is really not what it is. 
[01:54:30]  It's more like making fun of the entire topic rather than really, like, showing that women really are funnier than men.  And so it's kind of a hard tone.  Like, if you don't get it, you don't get it.  Yeah, like, every comedy documentary is like, oh, and then I struggled and I did, you know,  and it's not that, it's just fucking funny.  It's Artie Lang being fucking hilarious.  You?  This in here, in here.  You're not the clip.  No, it was funny.  It's fucking funny in here.  But you're happy with the way it's cut now. 
[01:55:00]  I love it.  I love it.  I do.  Can you stop, Artie?  And then I fucking, you know, you've watched it 10 million times.  Right.  But you can see little minor changes and stuff.  I've never seen it.  Huh?  You should let me see it.  I'm very good at that stuff.  You are?  Yes.  I'm a good rewriter and good editor.  Not that I'm going to rewrite that, but I'm good at that.  Well, yeah, because you got an eye.  You're a fucking comic.  And ears.  Huh?  And ears.  So, you know, so the stress of going on the road and doing all that and paying, you know, 
[01:55:30]  you put out that kind of money and you're going, well, what the fuck?  What if, you know, this industry, you know, if one person loves it, they all love it.  If one goes, where do you want it?  Where do you want it to wind up?  Because you could try to get it into.  Well, we want, here's the deal.  We have a lawyer that will probably try to sell it as a package, you know, with a TV  show attached and, you know, all that shit.  We will get more money.  If we get it into a festival, it will raise the value of the movie when it's time to sell 
[01:56:00]  it.  But if I could sell it outright for what, you know, what I want.  If I could start, we'll start taking offers right now.  If I could sell it outright without a festival, then I would fucking sell it.  You know what I mean?  I would like to buy it and then just re-edit it really sloppy.  Just destroy everything.  For no reason, yeah.  Every bit of vision they had.  Like every time you talk, just cut.  No, that'd be. 
[01:56:30]  Drop the audio out.  There's a lot of things I'd like to do, too, but I just, I can't.  You know, if you have 300,000, which you do, you could buy it.  That's my minimum.  300.  Sounds fair.  Sounds fair.  So you start negotiations?  Yeah.  No, I start, we start high.  You just announced that you're minimum.  Meanwhile, you take 131.  I know.  Fucking, you know, one night, one time I yelled at her and we were fighting.  I go, why don't you just leave?  Here's 25,000.  Get out.  She said no, and then I realized, never make your final offer first. 
[01:57:00]  You think you guys are going to stay married?  You're not going to break up.  I don't know.  We made a, we, we did this weird thing.  We, we, we made a pact that we would never get divorced.  I don't remember that.  It was called our marriage.  It's called a wedding.  Like, no, we're not going to get divorced until all gay people can get divorced in this  country.  You know.  That's a real commitment. 
[01:57:30]  She's actually so cool, but she's so prudy.  She's like.  I've never done it in the butt.  She fucking won't do 69.  Why not?  I, I, it's.  I don't know, but that's a fair question.  Why?  I also won't take a working vacation.  Does that answer your question?  I got to concentrate, you know, like, you know, when I was single and, you know, out  sexing it up and stuff, I, you know, I, I, you know, coming was pretty fucking easy. 
[01:58:00]  And then after you're married, you know, it's funny is that people are always like, I hear  girls going, oh, you got to get a guy who is good at kissing because, you know, whatever.  But it's like, well, that really, it's, that's only good until, you know, maybe for like six  months after you're married, then you don't kiss anymore.  It's over.  You know what I mean?  It's like.  Yeah.  Who kisses?  It's such a dumb.  Dumb.  So sex takes out a new thing.  So I got to, I got to think about it. 
[01:58:30]  The oral sex.  Do you like to 69 on the bottom of the top bridge?  What's that?  I don't, I don't remember.  I like to do it in yours.  Oh, you mean, I like to do it laying, both laying.  So why don't you do it once in a while, Bonnie?  Yeah.  Compromise.  Because this is the thing I get so resentful sometimes, like the fact that he wouldn't  fucking vacuum or I'll be carrying 87 things and he won't take one package out of my hand  or if you go, Hey, can you help me?  He'll be like, Oh, you can see his face that it's, it's, that he doesn't want to do anything 
[01:59:00]  for me that I get resentful.  Then I don't want to do anything for him.  He's doing the best he can.  No, thank you.  He has Asperger's.  Sometimes I honestly, I think like he's, he's narcissistic and it's like a, of course he  is.  Like I think like he's got a disorder in his brain, like give him some slack, which I try  to do, but I don't have narcissists.  Yes, you do.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I got to tell the story about your brother.  Can I?  I don't care.  Okay.  So his brother had some fell on hard times.  He fell and he's really going to fall now. 
[01:59:30]  Shut up.  So he, um, no, it's sad story.  It's really tragic.  He, uh, he's diabetes and he had like a, he went into a diabetic coma, diabetic coma, and  they didn't find him for a few days anyway.  Oh no.  Wow.  Yeah.  For a while.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, his kidneys failed and, and, uh, he had blood clots in his leg and they  had to amputate his leg.  Yeah.  And, uh, but we saved it.  Yeah.  They've got it on a mantle. 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  What do you call it?  Just, yeah.  We need stuff it.  We've stuffed it.  Um, uh, take his leg to a taxidermist.  So you have his, his leg get cut off.  He has his brain.  It's fine.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he's related to Rich, so obviously he's not perfect.  I don't talk, like I don't hate him.  We don't hate him, but we haven't, we talk maybe once every year, every two years.  We're just not close at all.  You're not close to any of your family, are you?  Uh, kind of more my sister just to fight, but no, I'm not close. 
[02:00:30]  I'm close with my kids.  You know, I broke the chain of dysfunction myself, but we just weren't close.  I just, she's close with her family.  Uh, but you know, I don't know.  I just haven't talked to him for you.  I don't know what the fuck he does.  Do you think Rich has broken the chain of dysfunction?  I think I, sometimes I wonder how bad was that family that he thinks he's, he really  thinks he's amazing, but, um, he's a good father. 
[02:01:00]  He's a good father.  Go.  So what about, uh, so we're in the hospital room and, uh, you know, Rich is rich.  He's, he's disconnected from his brother.  He immediately turns on golf.  His brother doesn't want to watch it.  Rich doesn't care.  Took a tournament.  Sitting there watching golf.  The brother for the first time, we've been there a couple of times before that starts  talking about the fact that he's lost his leg and you know, he's got to get a prosthetic 
[02:01:30]  and it's, it's, you know, he's like, I don't know how I'm going to learn how to walk and  stuff.  And Rich doesn't look at him.  Doesn't take his eyes off the TV where the golf was going on.  He goes, ah, you'll be fine.  Just stay positive.  And it was just so dismissive.  I was, I was trying to be positive.  You stay positive, you know, cause you wasn't a sincere, it was a shut the fuck up positivity.  It wasn't a sincere trying to make somebody feel better.  Then when I, yeah, no.  Cause then.  It was about you, not him.  That positivity was about you not having to hear his fucking blather as opposed to making 
[02:02:00]  him feel better.  Yes.  Yes.  Because I think we all know how positive Rich is.  Did I yell at Dunkin' Donuts right after that?  And then, yeah.  So then we go through Dunkin' Donuts and his egg sandwich was cold and Rich is like, fuck  you know, my egg sandwich is, God damn it, it's cold.  And I go, you're right.  You should totally get mad if your egg sandwich is cold.  But if you fucking have your leg amputated, stay positive. 
[02:02:30]  Did you go, did you go inside and get your egg sandwich?  No, we're already pulled away, man.  They fuck you at the drive-thru.  So, no, I mean, I, you know, you know, here's the thing.  Cause he's like, oh, you know, I'm not going to be able to, you know, he doesn't, he can't  see that, you know, it's going to work out in the long run.  And, and things, you know, now at least, you know, what, uh, no, I mean, what you're  saying that he feels like it's the end of the world. 
[02:03:00]  But, you know, once I, I played golf with guys with one leg with a prostitute, I've got  guys, you know, they run in marathons.  Look at the commercials.  It's true.  You know, I'm saying, you know, he, he, I, you know, you just want him to feel, be positive.  It's not, you know, don't whatever.  Be, I don't know.  I, it's just, I, I, you know, it's more of the community.  Rich is just rambling. 
[02:03:30]  Insincere blather.  Yeah.  You, you, you wanted to watch golf.  No, I didn't.  I didn't care about his fucking stupid no leg at the moment.  No, it's narcissism because he just, it was about somebody else and he's just.  That's not true.  I fucking, I take, I fucking give, give, give.  That's all I do is give.  You don't give.  Oh, I give.  I go, I do a lot of benefits.  I've never known you to give.  Are you crazy?  I do fucking better.  I've never heard you listen to a story where you didn't just have some nice follow-ups about  the person's story.  You always go, oh, I did that one time I did something exactly the same, a little bit 
[02:04:00]  better than you.  No, when Brewer was saying he had all that nice.  Jim Brewer was, it was here, right?  No, it was at his house.  We are at his house.  No, no, no.  But he was on.  No, no.  When he was talking about when, you know, doing Stern and all that stuff and.  Oh, no, this is the better Jim Brewer story.  Kate, Rich comes in, does O&A.  And I ask him, you know, on the way home, I was like, how'd it go?  What was it?  And he goes, ah, it was fine.  It was nothing, nothing going on. 
[02:04:30]  And I'm like, I'm, I don't know why I kept asking him about it because I'm fucking sitting  at home with a kid.  I have no adult interaction.  It's like, bring me news from the city.  And he's like, nah, Jim Brewer was in and talked about his family and stuff, you know,  nothing.  And a little backstory is that we edited most of our movie at Jim Brewer's parents' house  in the basement.  That's where the office was.  And so this story directly affects us and our movie also. 
[02:05:00]  So I keep asking him, well, what did I think?  Nah, he called his dad or he called his mom once or whatever.  Do you remember him being in the house?  I wasn't here that day, but I know the story.  When he called his mom?  Yeah.  So then I go into the edit and the editor goes, oh yeah, we're going to have to move  out of here.  I go, why?  He goes, oh, I guess, you know, because you were on, you know, Rich was on ONA the day  that Jim was in.  I go, I don't, he didn't tell me what, he said nothing happened.  He goes, oh, this is the other thing. 
[02:05:30]  Right before I tell this part, I did, Rich goes, I go, did you talk to Brewer at all?  And he goes, yeah, I told him he's got to see our movie.  He's got to look at it.  I was like, okay.  So this is what happens on the show is that his mom was caught like sort of abusing the  father and the father had to get taken out of the home and put in a home and she had  to go live with Jim and they had to sell the house.  And it was like, I mean, it's a pretty incredible story. 
[02:06:00]  It's a major upheaval.  And a major upheaval.  And it affects us.  Like there's so many, like, even if we weren't there, you'd be like, oh my God, this is kind  of a crazy story that's going on with Jim.  So then I go, so after I found this out, I go, Rich, when did you ask Jim about the  movie?  He goes, oh, right after we've done the show.  So Jim has just told this whole horrible story about his family. 
[02:06:30]  And then after the show, Rich goes, hey, you got to watch our movie.  No.  First of all, I gave him good advice.  That's narcissism.  First of all, I gave him some really good advice here.  Some of the best advice.  Do you not think you're a narcissist?  No.  I gave him some of the best advice.  I just got so much going on.  So listen, in this business.  We all do.  No, but you have a manager and an agent that does everything and you have Kenny and stuff.  Okay.  Don't, don't act like this.  If you were doing everything yourself, like I am, would it consume your fucking head? 
[02:07:00]  Sometimes.  Okay.  So you know it consumes you and you have people working for you.  Okay.  I don't make the money.  So right now at the money I'm making, which is decent money, but at the money I'm making,  it wouldn't be worth it to have these people.  But a manager would make you a little bit more and they would just take 10%.  No, they wouldn't.  No, not.  Or an agent.  I understand what you're saying that you've got a lot of like on your plate and I get  that and stuff, but that doesn't really excuse the fact that just on a one-to-one with people, 
[02:07:30]  you never, you never just engage them for being them.  Like you never allow them to just have a story.  I compliment a lot of people.  One time we were sitting at the, at the cellar and Amy Schumer said she got, who was her agent?  She said, Oh, Levity.  Oh, she said she just, she goes, uh, he goes, who's your manager or whatever?  She goes, Oh, I just signed with Levity.  He goes, Oh, cause I'll just take anybody.  It's like, like Amy Schumer doesn't have any real feelings either.  So it was fine, but it's like, you really do act. 
[02:08:00]  You pretend that we're all actors in your play.  You should do act like, get the fuck out of here.  You're just self-centered.  And he gets so angry if he can't control what he wants you to do.  You don't think you are, you don't think 90% of the comics are because it's a self-centered business.  I understand that, but I have the ability to empathize with people.  I'm not, we're all self-centered asses.  Exactly.  And this is the thing is that you rise to the most self-centered in a business full of self-centered people.  People who are in this business are going, wow, you're self-centered, and to everyone 
[02:08:30]  not in the business, you look like a fucking sociopath.  No, I don't.  You say it so.  A total disconnected person.  Should we break?  Yeah, we can break.  We put in an hour.  Oh, hold on.  God, I hope Anthony's not puking funny.  Anyhow, next weekend, next weekend, Friday and Saturday.  He just said that so that he could be like, see, I think about other people.  I know what he's doing.  I'm going to plug too.  Relax.  I know, I'm not plugging.  Go ahead.  He had to say the Anthony thing.  See, I care. 
[02:09:00]  We're at the Arlington Cinema Draft House, and Bonnie's even going to be on the marquee,  I think.  The Arlington Cinema Draft House, the 23rd and 24th.  Have you ever done that place?  Where's here?  No, Arlington.  Virginia?  No.  Fucking great.  It's like a theater, a little movie theater.  It's like a hipster type comedy place.  Okay.  23rd and 24th of March.  It's Bonnie and myself and a local host, and Bonnie's going to do, you're going to do like 
[02:09:30]  30 minutes this time.  You're going to do 30.  She's preparing now.  Can you stop condescending to me for five minutes?  All right.  Richard and Bonnie will be at the Arlington Draft House the 23rd and 24th.  He loves his job.  Tonight through Saturday, I'll be in Orlando at the Improv, and then next Friday, Saturday,  Uncle Vinny's for the first time in Point Pleasant, and March 29th through April 1st,  Caroline's, and then, you know, D.C.  Oh, you're going to Uncle Vinny's.  You got to eat the, get the pasta. 
[02:10:00]  Is it good or are you kidding?  Oh, it's so good.  No, they have a new chef.  His brother's not doing it anymore.  Oh, boy.  Was it not great pasta?  Oh, my God.  No, it's good.  Rich has never turned down free food ever.  Oh, really?  Except for...  No, it's good.  There's nothing wrong with it.  I've never done the room.  I hear it's a good room.  Yeah, it's funny.  Normally, I only do the Stress Factory in Jersey, that's it, but that's just, I'm one  of the smaller places to work on this thing, so... 
[02:10:30]  What thing?  Just, I'm shooting an hour in the end of April, so I wanted to make sure that it's ready.  Oh, I thought you already shot that.  No, I had to push it in April.  Why do you work on this stuff?  Just go fucking do it.  Like, you fucking got it down.  Well, you do, but it's like you have to pick the theater and the date, and everything  has been compatible, so you have to work on it, put it together, so it makes sense.  Well, I mean the material you got down.  No, you don't have to.  Come on.  You're talented.  No, I want it to make sense.  No, it's...  I want it to flow and kind of have a theme. 
[02:11:00]  A theme?  Why?  Why?  What do you mean?  Does the set have a theme?  Or just, you know, like, yeah, I want it to make, like, just have a beginning, middle.  Like, the end is just fucking, obviously, but I mean, you know, the...  Beginning, yeah.  The beginning is when you come out.  The middle is in the middle of the show, and the end is goodnight.  No, but I want it to kind of, uh...  So it could be, like, sort of a circus theme, or...  Yeah, something like that.  Pirate theme.  I want people to learn something about me.  You want it to be, like, a sleepwalking type theme?  No, but I want it...  No, but it's got to make sense.  Like, certain things can't follow certain things. 
[02:11:30]  You know what I like about Jim?  He's so funny and smart and quick.  Like, you really are one of the quickest people I've ever met.  Thank you.  And yet, lots of times...  Believe me, I knew there was an end yet coming.  Lots of times when people do jokes to you, you answer completely, like, honestly.  Do you not know that it's a joke, or that's your way of getting...  It's like, I don't have time for your...  No, no, no.  At times, I recognize that it's a joke, but sometimes if it's an attempt at a joke, and  I don't want to just fucking, like, uh...  You don't have to go, ha, ha. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, I'll just...  You know what?  I'll just, like, all right, I'll just answer it like it was a real question.  Because it was...  I got it.  He is quick on radio.  He's probably the quickest.  All right, shut up.  Exactly.  Stop trying to say nice shit.  I know, he's trying to, like, I can...  He's my favorite.  But yes, I didn't think anybody was really interested in my theme.  Well, I mean, what is it?  Are you going to come out in, like, armor or something?  Is it medieval, renaissance, whatever? 
[02:12:30]  I'm just still thinking it's an armor.  You don't have to expound on it.  Well, I just was going with...  I agree.  Can you spell medieval?  Huh?  Can you spell medieval?  Yeah, you're a pussy.  Ooh, that's right.  M-I-D Jew.  So that's some of the humor that you'll be hearing when we're in Arlington, Virginia.  All right, so we'll be back in a couple minutes.  I'm going to eat something and we have to catch up.  Not my pussy, I hope.  She's got a nice puss. 
[02:13:00]  I'm sure she does.  It's all right.  Oh, my God.  I got a picture of a big fat one that I like.  Really?  Their pussies are so ugly.  They're fucking the best.  You're gay.  Do you understand that?  Like, I think a scrotum is much more attractive.  They are.  If you look at a nice cock, a nice penis, like, if you're watching porn, what's going to get you a heart suit?  He's coming out right now.  No.  All right, we'll be right back.  All right.  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say, it's what he sees.  In his directorial debut. 
[02:13:30]  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you, I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Chloe, fiends, I want my money.  A bronc.  Tale.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on, what are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans, this guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time he sees me, he keeps dodging me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian, stammering his way through a few lines of film dialogue with a genuine Hollywood actor. 
[02:14:00]  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or no?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on, you got up cheap.  Yeah, you're right, John.  You're always right.  A bronc.  Tale.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time, and I read. 
[02:14:30]  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  This is the OPA Today Channel on Sirius XM.  On an all-new Jewish intervention.  Why are you always looking for a deal on everything?  That's what I do, okay?  This is my friend.  Comedian and Jew Rich Voss is confronted about his frugal spending habits.  You never buy yourself nice stuff.  The car's always two years old. 
[02:15:00]  Nice other people shit.  There's always something going on with you.  Will this once semi-famous comedian be saved by his more famous friends?  You gotta go to this new website.  Everything's on sale, like high-end shit.  See, it's always that.  That's what bothers me.  You're wrong.  You think you know everything about everything.  When was the last thing you actually bought something brand new and didn't go looking for a deal?  You don't get it.  Can the aging stand-up break the stereotype that Jews really are cheap?  There's no bartering.  There's no, I mean, maybe a little, hey, do this, do that.  You know, take a couple.  You got a dead guy's watch on this?  See this right here? 
[02:15:30]  See this shit right here?  Dead guy's watch.  Or is it simply too late?  It's too fucking late for him to change.  Bitch is what he is.  He's gonna go to a fucking garage sale.  It's not the bargain.  It's the fun of a negotiating, man.  It's not the bargain.  I don't believe him.  I don't believe him.  I don't believe him.  Find out on an all-new Jewish intervention.  Sirius XM.  The Opium F.A. Show.  We are back with Norton and friends with Opi is on vacation back on Monday. 
[02:16:00]  Anthony has what I'm hoping is food poisoning just because he was fucking bragging about that stupid Italian restaurant.  So, he left and Sam is still here.  And, of course, Rich and Bonnie are in and Kenny is here.  It's an electric atmosphere.  It really does.  You know, Rich and I, we were excited. 
[02:16:30]  I don't know if Rich was, but I was excited about coming because I've been in a long time.  And, yeah, I get here and Norton can barely ask a question.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Yeah.  It's not an interview-type show, Bart.  No, I know.  I know.  But I want a little, you know, excitement, a little energy happening.  But it is enjoying you guys are just talking.  It is more time for you guys just to yap because there's nothing going on.  We're just yapping, hanging out.  It's just guys and guys and it's like. 
[02:17:00]  It's just dudes hanging out.  And a girl, it's kind of like, you know, fucking that movie, you know.  What do you think of it?  What's the name of it?  You know, Soup and a Sandwich or something.  Soup and a Sandwich.  The one you were talking about with a girl.  What's he talking about?  Where they watch a movie and they cook and they fucking, you know, talk.  Oh, dinner and a movie.  Dinner and a movie.  Soup and a sandwich.  It's not a show.  It's an interstitial.  It's from years ago.  What's an interstitial? 
[02:17:30]  It's like what they do in between shows.  It's not commercial, but part of, I don't know.  This is what they did.  It was Paul Gilmartin and Annabelle Gurwitch.  And they did a thing called Dinner and a Movie.  Awful.  Gilmartin and Gurwitch are terrible.  And it was, is it like Up All Night with Rhonda Shear?  Is it like one of those things?  I don't know what that show is.  Yeah, it's similar.  It was like they would interrupt the movie and they would make some dinner.  They'd do a little, like, here's how you make a Caesar salad.  Yeah.  Oh, those are fucking terrible. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  I hate interstitials.  They're really bad.  I didn't know that this was going to be the thing.  Because they're never funny.  To get your passion going.  I'm just, I'm just so, I'm just very sleepy.  I could, I was up, I'm doing my, my storage unit.  I'm trying to clean it out and put them in bins, like plastic bins and make it neater.  So I've been obsessed with that, but it's been keeping me up a lot.  Where's your storage unit in New York?  Oh my God, here we go.  Because Rich has a fantasy about getting a storage unit, putting a bed in there so that 
[02:18:30]  we don't have to rent hotels when we stay in New York.  He wants to stay in his storage unit.  It's illegal to do that.  How do you know?  You're not allowed to do that.  How do you know?  First of all, you're supposed to be in show business.  You don't sleep in a storage unit, you fucking white trash.  This was back in the day.  Oh my God.  And I told you, I'm saying if you had a nice storage unit, one of it, you'd throw a couch,  something in there, and then during the day.  And what, do you just sit there and then sleep? 
[02:19:00]  And he said, he said this was back in the day, except instead when Norton said, this is  illegal, immediately he said, how do you know?  So immediately on his mind.  My storage unit.  He was back in the day.  He brought it up probably a couple of months ago.  He always, every once in a while, tries to float the idea again.  I have two of them in my building.  Like I have two, I bought them and they just help a lot.  Yeah, I got one.  They're not big enough to sleep in.  I got one.  Okay, back to you.  Oh, I'm just saying that. 
[02:19:30]  You acting like no one knows what a fucking storage unit is.  You obviously didn't because you're asking me questions about it, whereas in my building,  you're thinking of a self-storage unit that you go to the building and I'm letting you know  that in my building, it's in the basement.  Yeah.  So to stay in that one, you'd have to pay rent anyway in the apartment so I want to just  go upstairs.  No, I'm talking about mine's off property.  I know that.  Mine's not.  He just explained it.  I know.  What do you take?  Anybody's side but mine?  Yes.  Are you bringing stuff to Cleveland? 
[02:20:00]  You know, we're doing the garage sale thing in Cleveland.  What are you selling?  Well, we're going to auction off Opie Anthony and Jim's old shit because they were bringing  in the other day, Norton brought in a giant monitor and speakers that he didn't realize  were 10 years old.  Yeah, Cleveland is a place to go, one of the poorest fucking cities in the country.  It's a goof.  We're not trying to make money.  Oh, well, I just threw out fucking gigantic boxes of porn DVD.  I probably threw out...  Why didn't you throw them out?  That's what you should have brought. 
[02:20:30]  No, I thought of that, but giving out porn DVDs can be a problem over state lines and  shit.  I'm telling you, that's how they get you with some weird technicality.  I'm not fucking with porn.  I thought of that, but then I'm like, fuck it, just throw it out.  Because there's sodomy in them?  There is, yeah, and a lot of girls with penises.  A lot?  A lot.  Well, some.  You know, you get them in the mail, you're too polite to throw them out.  So whatever, you come to them.  I'll watch it out of...  We do out our porn.  Someone went to the trouble to give me this.  I did throw out a lot of porn. 
[02:21:00]  We had the worst porn, because we got a lot of porn free.  We had the worst porn.  You just go online now.  It's like, you go to clitty.com, there's every fetish.  Oh, clitty.  I love...  It's a terrible name, but it's a great site.  You don't ever put in porn DVDs anymore?  No, you don't need to.  I went through these boxes.  I couldn't believe the amount of porn I had, because Yoshi used to send it to me from  Evil Angel.  Oh, yeah.  And it was well over 1,000 DVDs.  If you go online, like, you know, you might click the wrong thing, and actually, you know,  the FBI is knocking on your door. 
[02:21:30]  That's not true.  That's never happened.  No one has ever one-clicked child porn by mistake, and then all of a sudden had the FBI  come.  No, no, no.  It doesn't happen.  You're right about that.  I don't think it has.  No, but can you get in trouble if you say you're, like, you know, I don't know, barely  legal, and then they find out she wasn't even barely legal?  No, because you're looking for barely legal.  You're looking for a chick who's 18 or 19.  That's allowable.  People still have...  There's still chat rooms.  People still do that? 
[02:22:00]  Like, no.  I don't think so.  I wouldn't know.  And how do these people meet the other people?  Hey, do you guys ever, if you're, like, lonely at night, call a party line?  I do.  Yeah.  Those are fun.  Yeah, I used to...  You can meet people, really.  There used to be a gay party line that was, like, you got these cards or something, and  it was, like, it was...  It cost, like, nothing, I heard.  So you prefer cocks to vaginas?  I know.  It's, like, I'm sitting between the two fucking gayest, dude.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why the two gayest guys?  I just, like, trannies. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, well...  At least there's got to be tits there, otherwise it's queer.  Beat it.  So, just when you and Rich have sex, does he make you talk about other, like, having sex  with other people?  Yes.  Yeah.  it is hot though it's hot there's something hot but then he's so jealous it confuses me you know  i'm scared that i'm gonna get in trouble no it's empowering because i'm a jealous guy too and i'm  insecure so when you talk to another girl about a girl about fucking other people it's almost like 
[02:23:00]  you're taking your worst fear and you're empowering yourself like it's almost like it can be this  fucking overwhelming crushing thing or i can jerk off like a fucking animal to it so i i i make it  sexual because it used to be so fucking threatening if i found out a girl fucked a guy with a bigger  dick than me it would drive me nuts and like why do i give a fuck like she's not fucking that guy with  me so years ago i stopped caring about that and i'll just make her tell me about it when she tells  me about the college professor who put the fake plant in front of the door so nobody could see 
[02:23:30]  somebody i come like a fucking jackrabbit yeah i'm telling you yeah i'm like i'm in his office  he puts the plant in front of the the glass door okay i came really it's the plant that gets him i  know it's like i don't even yeah he loves the plants not even you were the professor i know it's  something about putting that plant yeah something this is something about photosynthesis  so um don't try to say it well that's kind of that's kind of you're the only guy i know who 
[02:24:00]  does that besides me oh they're like it's fucking great yeah it is but he'll be like he'll he'll want  to have sex and he'll just like lay on he'll just pull his pants down and lay on the bed like this  no like he's planking and just like and like i'm supposed to be like woo yeah and he has gum in  his upper lip and sometimes he'll fart and he'll be like come on let's do it oh no we expect you to 
[02:24:30]  really expect you to blow him first yeah put your mouth on it no you say that rich put your mouth on  it give it a kiss you don't say that give it a kiss that's how fucking pedophiles get people to do  it give it a kiss that's fucking horrible he doesn't understand how women's bodies work like even  still like he doesn't know like i can't i i can't get excited i know this is gonna be hard to believe  but i can't get excited just looking at you that's why we got that lube i know but it's like 
[02:25:00]  so does he not like worry about like getting you stimulated no nothing no he won't even touch  down there before he shoves it in do you guys do what do you say when you talk it's always a little  bit rapey in the beginning you know does he say cock in bed the word cocked or like like will he say  suck my cock or just kiss it i'm not a talker i wish that were true in all aspects of life 
[02:25:30]  it just fucks up my my fantasies i try to get him to talk near my vagina so it can get  wet  why don't you guys watch porn together go on go on next we used to but then our house burned  down we don't have any we didn't do it out go online clitty.com i'm telling you they have  fucking every fetish i'm scared i'm gonna get bugs oh yeah you're not gonna get viruses just from a  big site like that you can't get a virus on an ipad anyhow apple doesn't get virus they occasionally do  but yeah apples are much easier and you're not gonna get it just from going to the site like a big 
[02:26:00]  site like that you're not going to just don't fucking go to a news group and download shit  yeah because you're not downloading anything on the sites anymore you're just you're just looking  yeah just opening up a fucking streaming link what's it called clitty c-l-i-t-i  clitty.com yeah no dot org i guess there's ads that will pop up yeah stuff like that they make  them dot gov yeah clitty.gov i didn't get it what uh never mind it's just the government's websites  or dot gov how did you know that it's like it's a follow-up questions or so no you don't

[02:28:30]  they are phoners do that a lot you'll call in and then they tape you and like all right we're  gonna play this tomorrow morning so you have to act like hey i'm there tonight but meanwhile you  haven't even left the city yet i like shaz and aj in connecticut just a lot of them i like i don't  know if i know those guys they're nice guys what are the other ones doing that are so bad it's just  that there's such a dishonesty in the way they communicate with you yeah they don't talk honestly  they don't talk like themselves they don't uh all right it's like five minutes of schlock it's it's 
[02:29:00]  it's like radio that's like fucking morning tv i gotta do morning tv tomorrow i did it in miami and the  chick is really why do you do it i mean i i know because when the when i'm not sold out in the  floor like i'm not sold out of course so it's like i can't say no i say no to hip-hop i will not do  hip-hop stations i'm not going to draw from them i've killed on hip-hop stations and nobody black shows  up it doesn't matter they just don't like my dumb face so these uh morning shows if i was if it was a  gig i was sold out on i would go absolutely not i think does the tv work does anybody come in from 
[02:29:30]  people that watch morning tv are housewives that aren't working that stay home yeah it draws  nobody the guys in florida are good too uh young around and paul or young riley just forget which  which but paul yeah those guys are great yeah they're not in fort lord though right yeah why  can't you just say i'll tweet instead like wouldn't that give you more that tweet anyway it doesn't  i've been tweeting tv's the worst because it's the it's the the black guy the white it's just so  fucking and there's a girl in miami i did recently do you remember her name she's  fucking sexy man and she's really nice yeah and she carried me through the segment because there's 
[02:30:00]  nothing i can do in my act that's appropriate for that i mean i i even the stuff that's not dirty  is it's racial or the ladies i go you know i just always make them uncomfortable on the thing and it's  just yeah you're good at that stuff i mean i'm terrible at those shows i think you're probably you  can pull those off like kevin hart i can imagine being great on those shows yeah because he could do  his thing and be funny garrett they're fun i don't know them yeah you did them when you did uh  captain bryans oh right right right they're real fun they were great actually yeah yes captain bryans 
[02:30:30]  i have a major but do they feel intimidated by you ever because you're on a oh no i don't think they  care about that radio no they plug it it used to be years ago nobody would mention satellite like you  can't talk about it and now they're like how's satellite they all ask me how satellite radio is last  week i was doing radio and the guy they kept going they kept saying how much they love ona and  a lot of them listen because the thing is ona can do what they really want to do all radio guys are 
[02:31:00]  all radio guys are checking out satellite there's no radio guys that don't care yeah all of them are  curious as to what it's like here because it's too uh confining it's confined it's just like tough  you have to worry about the advertisers so much so many celebrities used to watch tough crowd because  people we would say on tough crowd what they really wanted to say you know i'm telling  colin but i can't listen to the tough crowd thing anymore no what are you talking about no i mean  it's like it's like well how long ago was that show nine years 17 years ago it's like it's just 
[02:31:30]  he brings it up it is a rough one though i i have to agree with rich on this one it's it's a hard one  to let go yeah it was because this was it was a it was a uh institution  uh what forget it i agree with her now let's talk about it see when you watch byron allen's  show they're doing uh now that's a good show he farts on his wife where she's fart on his wife's  arm she doesn't even notice the podcast is the people tweet i'll tell me less farting like he that's 
[02:32:00]  how much he just is yeah byron allen did you host a couple of those i hosted some for byron allen yeah  byron allen i hosted uh they called me up you know they did the uh what was it called comedy  dot tv or something yeah the stand-up and uh he was like yeah so we want you to host some of them  blah blah blah because he wanted me to do a set and i i couldn't go out to la for the amount of money  that they were saying it was like but he said oh if you host four you know then we'll make it worth  your while and uh then at the end of the conversation he goes ah i gotta get one more thing 
[02:32:30]  are you still good looking no he goes are you still cute did you really share this yes and i  go i could stand to lose a few i guess but um like i had to like send a picture with a newspaper  it's funny that's a concern though it's like who gives a fuck but then that's what they do they hire  these cute girl comics you know to be the host and then i go before i went on i didn't know what i 
[02:33:00]  said nobody talked to me about my set or what i was gonna do i go how much time am i doing and  byron allen goes um do uh 30 seconds a minute whatever you're comfortable with that's how much  time i had and they told you they said that you don't even have to do comedy just introduce just  introduce if you want you don't even have to do what are you doing yeah no but why don't they just  hire uh smoke bottles because it probably costs more to do that than a comic who wants a crack at  it or a break you know it's probably easier to get the fucking comedians who want who want the 
[02:33:30]  shot on tv but i mean that's everybody just doing their act to each other it doesn't seem natural to  me oh no that show is different that's what i mean i mean that's the one where they all sit around  so you just got back from iraq hey you had an abortion it just makes it yeah and what bugs me  byron allen's a smart dude like he owns everything he's a rich fucking dude yeah it's he doesn't  bother me it's the comics that are actually doing it they're actually subscribing to it and pretending  to laugh at each other's acts well i was on the show with um what's that guy jimmy walker jimmy 
[02:34:00]  walker and uh i was sitting next to him and he would go into these rants and craziness i didn't  know what was going on and i didn't know if i would would it be worse for me to be looking like well  what the fuck is this guy talking about i didn't know if the camera would be on me when it was on him  or if i should it would be worse if i was caught laughing yeah like i didn't know i was like  struggling in my head like but he one time anytime anybody would say anything he would go on these 
[02:34:30]  like little ten minute about cell phones when somebody brought up cell phones and he went on  this rant literally nine minutes about cell phones it didn't make sense and about how kids have cell  phones and went on and on and on and on and then it's like awkward and then uh byron allen goes okay  well we're going to commercial we'll be right back whatever and and he turns to me and he goes  i just had lived that whole thing gives a fuck like really you couldn't tell it was spot on 
[02:35:00]  yeah all those shows i mean they're just just the idea is not the pretty like the thing about  tough crowd that was fun like this is why we keep going back to it is because it was you don't see  guys being honest on tv with each other like that like you don't see guys attacking each other  for trying to get applause breaks like they should that was comedians interacted on that show the way  we should interact which is laughing those guys made me laugh fucking hard geraldo patruth rich  people who were good at it were really good really funny and the people who were bad at it sometimes 
[02:35:30]  was good because you were like oh wow this can go really terrible but collins people always hated the  third i was some people hate the third act they always made me laugh because they were so weird  and he would brutalize you for fucking being a hack or for being predictable um or he would  fucking he would allow you to brutalize him it's like you just don't see that there was none of  that he would leave the dead air on he would leave the mistakes in yeah right it's like that's what  every alternative comic like they think they're alternative but that to me is what was alternative  to what was on tv was tough crowd right yeah it talked about race and it was doing really well 
[02:36:00]  in the ratings and we knew why it got taken away it was just because uh i and it's not a paranoid  point of view but they just didn't like they got too many complaints about the content and uh they  just were done with it i mean it bummed the whole room out yeah i remember when that got canceled it was  almost like you know when a girl breaks up with you the feeling the empty feeling this was worse it was 
[02:36:30]  of course it was it was and not only that it was in new york you didn't have to fly to la you just  hey oh i'm doing tv once a week oh no it's great fucking it was so much fun remember how awkward it  was after that because greg got a show the same night they kind of gave gerald of the show yeah but  that no i do kind of remember he was really awkward too it wasn't exactly tough crowd i know i wouldn't  do it patrice wouldn't do it because we we we you know we liked greg but we kind of felt like it 
[02:37:00]  would be just a lot of the call um you should have called me i would have i think i don't think it  went for very long i don't think driving greg was uncomfortable with it but you know he had  fucking three kids he wasn't going to say no to a tv show um i don't know if they gave him  it wasn't called tough crowd but there was another tough group it was called tough group yeah rough  group but it was something on on thursdays or whatever tough crowd was on every night it was a weeknight show  that's not why i heard it was canceled i'll tell you off air i know why i was there's a certain uh 
[02:37:30]  firing and i know i know all that i know exactly why but that was the main reason was that it was  fucking getting a lot of negative feedback from people that they don't like to hear negative feedback  from you mean uh uh liberal type people you're saying yeah it's like it's we talk about it all  the time and it sounds paranoid but i guess after my experiences there and with other tv things you  started to see the pattern and what what you can bash safely and without being without repercussions  or without them saying oh you don't want to do that and what you can't but if the people you're 
[02:38:00]  doing it to aren't complaining let's you know of course look at the trouble rush limbaugh's in just  for fucking bashing some woman who's a feminist it's amazing he okay i mean he should be bashed for that  yes you can bash him for it yeah that's you know he has every right to say it we have every right to  react bashing him was one thing but the fact that the people want him to lose his like i don't want 
[02:38:30]  anybody to lose to get in trouble for saying stuff i don't like so why did why do people when he says  that have this instinct to want to get him in trouble like you're right people do have the right  to react well i it's the advertisers they're the pussies and all of it because why why would you then  you know who rush is before you started advertising on his show those are the people that make it so  that nobody can do anything you can't say something and you can't have people react to you because god  forbid anybody notices the advertisers are going to pull out they're the people that they that that 
[02:39:00]  you should hate yeah but i'll tell you the the free market is like if you say you're doing really  well the advertisers come around because everybody listens right but if people just think you stink and  don't listen to you the advertisers have no reason to be on your show to me that's what's  right if you no one listens to you the advertisers will go away but when when people come after your  advertisers and go he said something we find objectionable we won't buy your product if you 
[02:39:30]  advertise on his show to me there's just such a scumbag mentality to that they're holding hostage that's  blackmail and i'm and again the people go we have the right to spend our money but you know what i i  actually kind of agree that that's like the people can speak you know we can say hey that's but why  would they want meaning why would they why was people speaking not just going ah the guy's a douche  like why is there this need to have him feel their dislike like who i don't i personally don't give 
[02:40:00]  a fuck what he says he's he's valueless to me right exactly i agree and sharpton uh is a guy i truly hate  but i've never encouraged people to boycott sharpton and as much as i wish sharpton would  fucking fall down an elevator shaft i've never encouraged people to try to get him fired but  but fired from what well he's on msnbc oh oh but if i don't have that instinct to get other people in  trouble why does anybody have that instinct like why would you want to call an average i don't give a 
[02:40:30]  fuck what any of these guys say none of them have any value to me they're not influential  right but that's the thing is but they are influential that's that's their whole job their  whole job is to try to get people to to believe what they want them to believe you know it's not  just pure entertainment the way that he wants you to believe that it is it's not he he's got a very  serious agenda that he's trying to get as many people as he can to vote or do what he wants them to 
[02:41:00]  do okay then instead of getting if that's the truth it's got to work both ways yeah how about they give  him credit for all of the positive things that happen because people listen it's like that's  the way i look at it like i happen because of rush or anybody like that like anybody like that means  by by by the nature when you're watching someone like that you're being involved in politics when  imus was was was thrown under the bus imus is an entertainer though i mean it really is different  you know it's money he raised for so he's okay and hannity or or any of them even on the left or 
[02:41:30]  the right they all have positive causes they all raise money for charity they all do  fucking charity events so you know so you can't they get they get what uh hannity does that freedom  concert all over the fucking places money for fucking yeah nobody says oh that's terrible yeah  but nobody's bringing that up no one brings that up either too the the opposition never say hey here's  something good that person did you know and and same with the right they never say hey here's  something good that person did on the left but why but the thing is that what russell said i guess 
[02:42:00]  i don't understand that why would people bring that up if they're mad at something else you don't  do that it's got to be a balanced thing if you're going to penalize somebody don't go this guy's a  fucking rapist but he's dresses really well but a rapist is well you could say that but right and  a rapist is a little bit fucking different than a guy just doing his job and saying what he wants  to say no it's not but who gives us what he says is but i don't buy that whole thing they're  influential to me they're not they're valueless like i enjoy them sometimes but they don't form 
[02:42:30]  my opinion that's almost like saying you no but i don't to me that's elitist though and that's an  elitist way of thinking is that well i can see them but the masses can't no i i don't think that the  masses i just think like people it's just like it's it becomes this sort of you get if you listen to  the same thing every day the same propaganda all the time well you're calling it propaganda you're  calling but then you're the dummy for listening like the dummy that listens to and believes that  propaganda like is is a dumb motherfucker like if you listen to russia and actually think that's 
[02:43:00]  the gospel you're a dope same as if you listen to fucking right but those dopes vote and they they  have they have you know the our country is that their as is that their whim yeah but you're saying  there's propaganda coming from him but i'm saying not just him but i mean okay whatever i mean i  think like a lot of that right kind of radio it's extreme because it has to be extreme because that's  what well that's what happens that's how ratings get made and stuff but it also affects what happens 
[02:43:30]  in our country saying with the left i say our country even though i'm canadian it's extreme on both  sides you don't think fucking i agree it's extreme on both sides i totally agree who cares it's not  it's not causing it's not it's not encouraging people to go out and commit murders let it be  extreme who cares it's almost like i give everybody credit for making up their own minds i'm not arrogant  enough to think for other people like and i don't want anybody thinking for me i don't let no no no 
[02:44:00]  actually but what i'm saying is is that so that when when people do say hey i mean this guy's gone too  far whatever like rush that you know he's being a i mean a total fucking asshole why are they not  penalizing saying that so then we we come out you know other people come out feminists as you call  them say hey this is this has gone too far this is ridiculous that's that's just balancing things  out but that's all you're doing yes and i agree however it doesn't stop there they go to the 
[02:44:30]  advertisers and go we don't want him saying yeah we have a problem with him saying that you're right  them coming them going on a radio show or them going on tv shows and if they would they said that  twitter that's a i mean that's what i think was the biggest or wherever and if they said that fat  junkie should drop dead of a heart attack i would have no issue with that response he's a pig he's  stupid like i have no issue with any of that response and them saying he's garbage but it's when  they want him to be silenced i know all these dummies that disagree with because they hated rush 
[02:45:00]  oh the free market i don't think anyone should be silenced because i feel like i do no i honestly  i put a cock in it um no because uh you know i mean i i enjoy people who will go and say things that  that even if i don't agree with it i like people who are willing i like i like when ann coulter says  things because it's people will most people will she knows that's going to draw the ire of a lot of 
[02:45:30]  people and she's willing to do it anyway i like those people that i think the world needs people  that are willing to say stuff even though like the majority the masses are going to come at them  but um i don't know that pissed me off but rush but it changed the thing is what gets you this is  why it's so fraudulent because it changes that's why everyone's tripping on their dicks because it  changes from week to whatever it affects you but everything like whatever will get you fired 
[02:46:00]  like whatever i hate to keep saying the sacred cow but years ago you could make fun of asians all you  want now if you do it on the radio you're fired and then uh you know not beheaded hose was so terrible  it wasn't terrible a year before that and it wasn't terrible when this guy said it but then it became  terrible it just changes every week there's a new outrage more and more people have to apologize and  we should be embarrassed as a country but here's the thing i don't even know why do people apologize  i mean because of the advertisers but i would love it if people were just like ah i would it would be 
[02:46:30]  it would mean more to me if people just said that's how i feel that's it then you know don't listen to  the show if you don't like i agree but that's and that's in and this is the problem in a world where  feminist or anybody and i would just say feminist because of rush in that moment where people just go we  don't like you you suck he would go fuck you don't listen right and then their little voice  i agree they wouldn't get what they wanted they would be heard but they wouldn't get to have him  silenced so like in a spoiled society right we want our feelings to be reacted upon right and 
[02:47:00]  people don't want special interest they want they don't want equal rights they want more right  all they also want they're like little children they want to object and they want whatever they object  to taken away right and stopped because they can't handle that a guy is saying this stuff  that they don't like that's the fucking the self-centeredness of everybody  fucking drives me you know what i i agree with you you've you've brought me around a little bit  oh that said you know i hate rush's radio voice i'm a douche i don't know 
[02:47:30]  like what kind of like i mean the thing was that he said was so dumb it was just so dumb on so many  levels it was like maddening in a way it's like you know a you don't know how birth control works  be every woman on the planet uses it see it's like it's better than having fucking thousands  of unwanted kids i mean there's so many things i i agree with that but i wish you're right but i  you know what if we're going to be in that honest then how about when when she's in front of congress 
[02:48:00]  testifying she makes that argument like let's be honest most of the abortions that are being had  are not are not going to grow up to be fucking presidents like like don't don't hide behind the  fact that the rest of us are wrong to think a certain way to just be very honest about what it  is we have an argument she thinks i had an argument with her last week anybody against gay marriage she  says is is a hate monger i didn't i you keep saying that i said it's like saying monger no no you said 
[02:48:30]  people could be against gay marriage and not not have any prejudice towards gay people i don't  believe that that part i don't believe yes it's i don't believe it i believe that they don't want  equal rights for everyone then they have a problem with gay people but they be maybe they believe in  the institution of marriages between men but no i'm just saying it doesn't mean you're anti-gay  it doesn't mean you're anti-gay let me ask you a question if they look at gay people i'm for  gay marriage i think that if it could not be for it is ridiculous yes but do you like there are 
[02:49:00]  certain people that really think it's a net like let's say you're raised religious and you really  firmly believe that that's fine and you shouldn't do it then you shouldn't do it and you shouldn't  marry another person of your same no no but let's say they look at it like it's a character flaw like  or a defect like pedophilia let's say they view it like that like it's a sickness okay are they being  anti-gay yes because well are you anti i guess you are anti-pedophile you have to be because the thing is you  can't make those kind of judgments because it's adults and not everybody subscribes to your 
[02:49:30]  religion i don't understand why christians think that everyone has to live by their rules it's like  it's like you go ahead go ahead and and and if your church doesn't believe in gay marriage then  then i respect that and i don't want you to have gay marriage i don't want you to i don't want  you to have you know sex with another man i don't want you to like don't do any of that stuff  i'm not going to force you to do any of that stuff but now these this couple over here who  they both have really great jobs they pay their taxes they adopt kids that nobody else wants right 
[02:50:00]  let them fucking get married let them have the same rights as you you don't need there's no reason  why you should be telling other adults who aren't bothering you no i agree with you i'm just saying  that there's you know first of all why people hate gays i don't know that for the most part they're  a pretty decent group i mean they're good neighbors they're not like puerto ricans  what's that what did you say she said they're not like puerto ricans  but their neighborhoods are always clean like you're not a gay block in 
[02:50:30]  fucking chelsea it's immaculate we walked through one never a fucking problem we walked  through one yesterday there and it was beautiful i said to the guy i was walking with and bonnie i go  look how how clean this neighborhood is you know uh and they have good jobs for the most part  they pay their taxes i was only saying if somebody if somebody looks at  like a sickness does that make them anti-gay they have jobs and they pay taxes i'm just  saying i know i'm generalizing because a lot of them have meth problems and you know what  fucking people are people but but i hate when everybody goes oh you don't believe in what i 
[02:51:00]  believe in so you hate me that's not true yeah that's not that's the point i was making with  this stupid analogy yeah it doesn't just because some people are against gay marriage because they  hate fags and some people really just think it's wrong because they think that gay people are  sick and that you shouldn't do it that's fine though but that's okay that they can they can live in that  world but i don't but they should realize is that hate though that's not hate i didn't say it's yes  it's hate because it's saying that not everyone should have the same rights like how about if i  think it's like it's like it's like when you know and and this is the other thing that bothers me about 
[02:51:30]  it is that like well you know all these people they don't want gay marriage there's got to be  something to it look i i'm pretty sure there's a lot of people who didn't want to the end of slavery  to happen and somebody led the the the charge and it happened you know somebody had to be the leader  that's what that's what bugs me about the politicians the way black people throw gays  under the bus kind of bugs me too like black people never see the argument that the civil rights and  the shit that they had to put up with and the garbage they went through and then gay people 
[02:52:00]  going through it and black people never or or very rarely look at it and go yeah it is the same  struggle it's like no no no it's a choice black people hate when gay people mention the black  silver you can hide gay they say and you can't hide being you're the case of choice in black in this  room very well yes not really all right should we break uh we can next weekend yeah i guess we  should plug real gay people come to arlington oh we're a very gay friendly uh show bonnie we do a  lot of i do do a lot of gay jokes and a lot of well that's another thing too they shouldn't get it 
[02:52:30]  when you want equal rights you got to take equal abuse too you know jim david i asked a question too i had  him and rick chrome after um tracy morgan did his gay thing jim david made a good point like i was  asking those guys what why shouldn't he why do we have this double standard and language for stuff  and jim raised a good point he goes ah you know he goes it's uh it's not an even playing field  i agree to begin with so you're more sensitive to that because you're not starting in the same  it's not like two equal shit on each other it's one who can do things that others can't 
[02:53:00]  well that's not true that made actually a good point  yeah nobody ever goes okay uh hetero like no you know it's not like people make fun of  gay people even when they don't mean to they'll be like oh you've been sucking his cock or something  like that but that's not true there's and it's really there's gay comedy clubs in the village and  all over and i'm sure they're uh they're going after you know stray people and and jokes like that  so it's still not a level for a little society you can call someone gay and get a laugh but what's 
[02:53:30]  a level you should feel what's a level playing field in society okay a level playing field uh  yes there is uh two guys who are able two people who are able to go out and do the same thing  and everything that happens to them is basically whatever choices they make  i lost you i think that's a level he's saying all things considered both people have an equal  starting place and can do whatever they want and their choices who are these two people just white  a waspy way to individual you say what's a level playing field i'm just saying you're two people 
[02:54:00]  when you break it down to groups blacks don't have a level playing field right gays jews in some areas  don't that's why when we were listening to that guy on the radio last night and he was saying like  about chris rock saying uh calling uh obama's administration a black party or black heaven  black heaven and he was like if we said that white heaven i was like it's you can't that's like you  can't make those kind of comparisons i hate when they go after any comic yeah yourself don't go 
[02:54:30]  after comics i hate it and i hate when other and it's called the white house it's called the white  house absolutely other comics i go after other comics going oh he said this drives me nuts when  you're a fucking comic attacking another one on on twitter or this and that go stop it there's  enough with bloggers and reporters taking out of context you know as a comic don't you  you fucking do it about another comic i don't care how bad they are that was rich voss everybody  with comics shut up your voice more with rich voss right after let's do some plugs um anthony

[03:07:30]  But I love the O&A audiences  Because they are so...  They really don't get offended by anything  No  The ones that come to the club are a great audience  Sometimes you think...  You look in their faces and you're like  Oh, this guy hates me  And then after they're like  Hey, I love you  I know what I hate  Well, first of all  I will say this  They only ask that you're funny or you're not funny  Yeah  That's why I love those crowds  You never...  Or very rarely...  I got grown so much at the Cellar recently  Like...  Keith Robinson was talking about race 
[03:08:00]  And being a situational racist  About how he likes Asians at certain times  It's a very funny bit  Yeah  So I went on and afterwards  And I said, I'm also a situational racist  Like, I don't like black people when they host shows  And some people laugh  Other people are like, oh  And then I'm doing my racial stuff  And people are getting uncomfortable  Yeah  And it's like, you fucking cocksuckers  Like, the black guy was just doing racial stuff  It's okay  He can hit...  O&A audiences are not like that  No, not at all  That's the worst  When you're on the road  Like, in my contract  That I make 
[03:08:30]  I say no black openers  Because it's not them  It's the audience  Do you really say that?  No  Oh, that's hilarious  I was about to worship you  Huh?  I was about to worship you  No, I pretty much tell all the bookers  Because it's not the black openers  See, he just said no  And then he said yeah  Like, when you said  Shut up  Don't try to fucking explain  Because you don't know  Yeah, he did do that  He wants to be worshipped  I lied  I don't care about you  First of all  It's not the black comics  It's the audiences  That fall for the bullshit  And then fucking hate you 
[03:09:00]  For doing anything  You know  That is funny though  It's not the black comics  It's the audiences  For not seeing what frauds they are  Yeah  Fair enough  You have a lot of checks there  Yeah, I go to the bank very  Seldom  Thank you  I was going to say infrequently  But you can make it one small word  If you want  Seldom  See, I'm just  I have to go to the bank  He's a wordsmith  I have to go to the bank  Before I go to the airport  I'm looking forward  To getting down to Florida  It's just depressing the road 
[03:09:30]  It's fucking depressing, man  Yeah, tell her  It's depressing  Because you think that  Like, there's certain markets  I do great in  And other markets  It's shit  It's shit  And it doesn't matter  How much press I do  Like, I'll do  Again, Monsters in the Morning  I like doing those guys  You do look forward  To doing certain radio shows  Because you're like  I'm going to laugh  They're going to be fun  To hang with  Like, I know I'll be okay  On that one  But morning TV  I fucking hate doing it  And it doesn't help  It doesn't help 
[03:10:00]  We almost got kicked out  Of the Monsters in the morning  Because of her  Back in the day  She walks in and goes  Now, which one's  The head monster?

[03:10:30]  Every club I work  Don't blame me  Oh yeah, really?  How about Pittsburgh?  And then you walked off stage  And went to the back of the room  Going  That was back in the day  She kills  She kills  Right  But back in the day  She walked off stage  And went to the back of the room  Hi, you miss me now?  And someone yelled out  No  Because I left the stage  I just walked off  And the emcee was in the back  Didn't know  So there's no one on stage  And I walked around  To the back of the audience  Do people not know  When you're kidding sometimes?  Oh, yeah 
[03:11:00]  All the time  It is hard to read you sometimes  I mean, I know you a long time  But I can see people  Like thinking  Like, wow  She's just a bitch  But when you're just being funny  Yeah  And you're just being  You know  Silly and sarcastic  A comic class  How do you say  She's mean  Too mean  What comic  What great comic said that?

Because it's a reflection  You think they're bypassing you?  No, I know they are  I don't think they are  I know when I'm in the right lane  And they're in the left  See you later  Yeah, it's like  How's Amy doing?  Oh, she's high-beaming me  Let me get out of the way  I don't mind it as much  With women, though  Because you're not competing 
[03:12:00]  Against them in anything  All right  Any more of my thoughts  You want to finish?  Oh, sorry  No, you're actually right  That's exactly it  You're not competing with anybody  Because you're an individual  Who's created  Oh, my God  I can't believe this  No, not him  Is that the philosophy  He lives by?  The platitudes  You're an individual  You're an individual  Is, uh  First of all  Does Rich live this way?  Bonnie, is this the way?  No, he's so angry  And bitter about everyone  No, I'm not  Oh, no, not about comics  Not talented ones 
[03:12:30]  When I see talented ones  Get ahead  Oh, I'll say this for Rich  He does  He  He  He's very good  At picking out people  That really are funny  Whether they're guys  Or girls  Or starting  Or been in the business  200 years  Or whatever  He's always  Do you know  I always thought that  About myself, too  Like, I have a great ear  For music  Like, I know what's  Going to be a hit  And I realize  Oh, yeah  You like the same thing  Everybody likes  That's why it's a hit  Right  Like, so if you pick out  People who are  Genuinely funny  You just  No, but sometimes 
[03:13:00]  You get jealous  Of somebody  Who's doing well  And you can't really  Some people say  I don't think he's good  You know  Yeah, yeah  They kind of  They allow their jealousy  To cock back their  Fucking real opinion  Right, right  You know, when you see  Somebody that's great  That gets something  That gets ahead  When there's  Not only comedy  With music, acting  When there's so much  Fraud out there  And so much garbage  Put on TV  Like I said to somebody  Before  We don't have a TV show  But fucking storage bins do  Yeah, okay  You know, a guy  That's fucking

Because I'm on a radio show  Honestly that's why  I'm not even being a smartass  No  It's because I just  I've thought of it  But I don't have enough dedication to it  Podcast listeners are fucking loyal  But  I have this  And how much immediate people  What am I going to talk about  That I'm talking about here  I talk for 20 hours a week  Yeah that's a good point  But  And I do Boneyard  Excuse me  It's too much 
[03:18:30]  Because Riotcast  What we're on  The network we're on  Riotcast  Yeah  Riotcast  I would love to have somebody  As big as you on  As fucking big as me  I'm a zero  You're not a zero  You gotta think  You gotta be positive man  Yeah alright  That's true  I'm a one  You gotta stay positive  Alright let's get out of here  You'll be fine  Feel better stupid Anthony  Thanks for having me on  I really had fun  Arlington Cinema Drafthouse next week  Can I please have 200 people  Buy Still Empty Inside this week  I get yelled at 
[03:19:00]  For plugging  Why?  Who yells at you?  People on Twitter and stuff  But plug  You know  And Sam you'll be here after  I think we held the fort down  I think so  I think it won't work  I had fun  I don't know if anybody listening  Who's that hottie out there?  I think that's Allie Landry  Is that a famous person?  She was on the Doritos commercial  She's totally famous  She's totally famous  I think that's her  And she's got kids  She's got two kids  What do you see?  That's all you do  Is read that garbage  I know stuff  You guys did fabulous today  You probably recognize  A lot more celebrities than I do 
[03:19:30]  They're fucking half of them  I have no idea who they are  Alright we'll see you in a few minutes  Alright bye guys  This is after ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  This is after ONA Live  Not this show that was just on  You didn't miss that  Roland was just giving us  A concert in here  What? 
[03:20:00]  Roland was  I guess we've had a guitar  In the studio  For the last week  And  Roland  How come you're not singing anymore?  Roland had the guitar up  And he was singing  Eric you saw Roland performing  In here didn't you?  I was watching it  Through the glass  Yeah  He was doing that  Elvis hip shaking  With the guitar  And then doing the windmill  And Travis was in here  He heard you singing  Yeah  Why don't you want to sing anymore? 
[03:20:30]  Because we're live  We're not live  Nobody's listening  Everybody wants to hear the Roland concert  Maybe later  A song called  Paul's looking for a post-it  Paul?  I gotta tell you  Yesterday  I love  When people feedback  Into after Opie and Anthony Live  Feel free to do it all the time  Twitter name is not Sam  I'm not hiding  I like to  To read what people think  Of the show  But  Like for instance  Yesterday  I said  Johnny Cash 
[03:21:00]  Wrote a boy named Sue  When we were talking  About country music  I got a ton of tweets  Correcting me  Saying no no Sam  It was Shel Silverstein  Who wrote that song  And I'm glad that they did  Because I don't want to sound  Like an asshole for too long  As long as I can cut it off  Within 24 hours  It's much better  There are assholes  For tweeting you that  No I'm glad that they  Corrected me on that  Here's the assholes  This is where  I'll  It's beyond me  Roland  I'm glad  That there's so much  Of the audience  That can process thoughts  That get what's going on here 
[03:21:30]  Because there are  Sections  Of the people  Listening to this show  That just cannot  Process thought  They don't  Understand what's going  On around them  They don't know  What they're listening to  For instance  Here's what happened  So yesterday  There was a big blow up  Between Paul and Troy  For the most part  Where Paul's work ethic  And what he was doing here  Was brought into question  A lot of backstage drama  Going on  The day before that  Was Wednesday  Tuesday 
[03:22:00]  And that was Eric  Going under the bus  And Eric and me  Were going at it  And so  This is what happens  People  People  Are tweeting me  Saying  What's the matter  Sam  Can you not do a show  Without bringing in  The staff  For backstage drama  Hey Sam  Enough of this staff  Bickering  Get back to the show  That's the show  That's right  Thank you Roland  Do not  And then  And then  Roland  This is what else  I get  I get  That's the one  Criticism  The other criticism 
[03:22:30]  Is  Sam  We know what  Happened during the show  Why do you have to  Sit there and recap  What happened on the show  This is after  Opie and Anthony live  This is the after  This is the post show  To Opie and Anthony  I understand that  Sometimes  We go off on tangents  But that's how  The Troy stories  Bleed into  The O and A show  Because it starts here  The seeds  Starts here  And then it goes forward  So what happens is  We talk about  What happened on the show  And then we talk about  New things to bring 
[03:23:00]  To the show  The whole point of this show  Is to  To recap  Some of the things  That you might still  Have questions about  That happened on O and A today  And  To bring you behind the scenes  A little bit  And show you what's going on  I'm not doing  The Sam Roberts show  If you want to hear  The Sam Roberts show  It's on on Sundays  If that's what you want to hear  Or podcasts  During this  Or the podcast  If that's what you want to hear  During this hour  Feel free  To contact  Anyone who you want to talk to  At Sirius XM  And suggest that to them  But for right now 
[03:23:30]  I would assume  That what people are  Wanting to listen to  And what I believe  Is the proper programming  For this time slot  Is the Opie and Anthony  Show post show  And what that involves  Is recapping the show  And  Getting  Getting to know  What's going on  Behind the scenes  Yeah like Paul  Was looking for a post it  What does that mean  For five minutes  Paul was looking for a post it  For five minutes  I don't want to  I don't want to go too hard  On Paul today  Eric how's Paul doing  In there by the way  How does he look  Still looking for a post it  Is he looking for a post it 
[03:24:00]  Oh Eric's listening  To something for later  He had a rough day  Here on After Opie and Anthony  Live yesterday  By the way  Anthony tweeted  Anthony stepped away  From the show  After the first hour  It seems as the  Italian food  That he was crowing  About all morning  Suddenly  Snuck up on him  And  Like the delicious burritos  You're like  What a fucking good meal  And then like  A few hours go by  Maybe ten hours  And then all of a sudden  You're like  What just happened to me  Where 
[03:24:30]  How did this all happen  How did  This delicious food  Why am I sweating  It tastes so hot  Yeah  Cold in here  What happened  I'm falling into  A different dimension  Yeah  An explosion of the ass  That's what happens  So he had to go home  So his ass could explode  In peace  Home base  Yeah home base  So I could read  Relax  Watch TV  Of course  A little shit  Here and there  Or sometimes it's so bad  We don't want to wipe  Just shower it off  How often do you have  Shits that are so bad  You have to shower 
[03:25:00]  Once a month  Maybe twice a month  So you're  Every two to three weeks  Say that  Well sometimes it's so bad  You're like  Am I going to waste  All this toilet  It's going to be a bad one  I don't want to clog the toilet  So I just hop in the shower  So you just flush  It's like a human bidet  You just  First of all  A shower is not a human  And second of all  You just flush  And then you just get in the shower  And wash the ass crack right there  Right there  It's smart  And Roland  I mean you have  Horrendous shits  You bet  Yeah I do  So maybe that works for you  I don't know  I don't remember the last time 
[03:25:30]  I had to do that  I mean I've had to use  More toilet paper than usual  I had to do that  At a friend's house before  It was embarrassing  Although  I don't even know anymore  There's somebody on Twitter  Who now doesn't think  That we should be talking about  Shit on this show  Oh  So let's talk about  Paul looking for a post-it  Explain to me Roland  Does this make any sense to you  That people are saying  Not to recap the show  And not to bring  Staff drama up on the air  That's the whole thing  But that's you though  That's why the show exists 
[03:26:00]  We shister after the show  And people get very upset  That you bring it in tomorrow  If you just want  Worst of Opie and Anthony  To play between now  And Ron and Fez  All you freaking  You idiots  Who just sit there  By your radios  All  Anybody  Who doesn't want me  Recapping the first hour  Of the show  At ten o'clock  Is sitting there  Listening to the entire show  Far too closely  And I know you have  Your own Opie and Anthony  MP3s on your computer  So go ahead  And make yourself a playlist  And turn the god damn channel  Because there is no way  There is not a chance in hell 
[03:26:30]  That I will stop doing  Staff drama on this  E-Rock  You've known me  For quite some time  What do you think  Based on what I believe  This show is intended to be  The after Opie and Anthony live show  What do you think the odds are  That I'm going to ease up  On staff drama  Slim to none  None is the answer  Yes  Yes  That's correct  And it shouldn't be  That's the whole purpose  That little little squabbles  Can come up on this show 
[03:27:00]  And when they become bigger  If Opie and Anthony  Want to get into it  It becomes a public thing  And they can bring it  On to the main show  Do I have to spell  Everything out for you  Just trust me guys  Just trust me  If you don't like what I do  Turn off the radio  But until then  Just trust me in here  We're going to go up and down  Like any roller coaster  There's going to be some slow moments  But I promise you  There'll be some very fast moments too  Trust me in here  I know what I'm doing at this point  Somewhat 
[03:27:30]  Somewhat  Yeah  And I'm getting better all the time  And you have a big guest next week  Coming to the after show  That's right  I'm very excited about that  I don't know if I want to announce it yet though  Because you never know  Things change all the time  Tell me what you were talking  Because like I said  Yesterday's staff drama  Was Paul and Troy  Paul is our phone screener  And Troy  He flipped off Troy at one point  Very rudely  And this led Troy  To lambast him  Troy was obviously waiting for a reason  And  And that was the reason 
[03:28:00]  To basically bring Paul in here  And question  Now somebody feedbacked in  Stop talking about criticisms  Of the after show  On the after show  Troy brought Paul in here  To question his work ethic  And say what are you doing in here  What do you do  And it was uncomfortable  Roland  We should bring Troy in though  To see how he's doing  You love conflict  I don't  You do  I do  You start a lot of conflict  I don't  You do  Yesterday I did 
[03:28:30]  You do  But even you left here  Because you were uncomfortable  Yeah  Because it was real  Yeah  Because once I traded  He gets a thing in his eye  I'm like I'm out of here  Which is why I want to  You know not  This isn't a Paul date today  Paul had his day yesterday  And we got to go  A little easy on him  Troy should dress better  Jesus Christ  But what are you saying  Why are you calling Paul  Post it  Because Roland  I don't know if you heard  During the commercial break  Roland picked up the guitar  And started singing songs  About Paul  And I sang a song about you 
[03:29:00]  How angry you were at Paul  So why don't you do that  On the air  I don't know  He stopped  As the intro was coming on  He put the guitar down  And walked to this table  There's all positive things  About you though  Yeah but you always have  A lot to say  You should just say it on the air  Roland has a lot to say  A lot to say on everybody  But it depends on  What ears are around  Exactly  That's Roland's deal  Yeah  I don't know if you know  This about Roland  Oh no I didn't know  That about Roland  You know this about Roland  Yeah  Eric what's up  I'm just finding out  We may have a recording  Of Roland's concert 
[03:29:30]  No way  Yeah if you give us  A few minutes  We might be able  To pull it for you  How are you feeling Roland  How's it going over there  Big man  How's the road dog  Doing over there  I just have to  Tell Eric one thing  Well yeah I mean Eric  You know that there are  Certain things  That was  Even  Even on the air  I wasn't in there  So I didn't hear it  Why don't you give it  Give it the old listen  Before you bring it in  Oh okay  And Roland's gonna go in  Now don't give Roland  Final edit  I think Roland should  Promise somebody  Another handjob 
[03:30:00]  In a fucking barbecue  Eric will you  Take the handjob  And stay  He's panicking  Hang on I'll be right back  Steak and a handjob  I love that  Yeah because  Because there are  Certain things  Sal's running back  Yeah  He's probably gonna  Show Paul how to do it  There are certain things  Sal the intern  You like that one  There are certain things  That are said  Yeah I  Just discussed with him  We'll make the proper edits  And  No but was he justified  In the edit  I think so  Can you say what it pertains to 
[03:30:30]  Is it a management thing  Just a term that he didn't want  Oh oh  A bit of a slur  Yeah  Okay we won't say what the slur was  But he did a slur  And if Roland  If Roland doesn't want to use  Those slurs on the air  That's understandable  Yeah yeah  I mean he does have to deal with  It is funny though  That like  The real  The real vocabulary  That staff members  Once want to use  Is unable to be said on the air  Yeah  Yeah  Wow  By just saying  It's on the toilet  It was a nice  It's like 
[03:31:00]  Why were you calling Paul  Posted  Because  Travis heard Jimmy say something  He goes  Let's mark that  And then  Paul goes  Oh I'll write it down  In the poster  Then he started writing around  Do you have a poster  Do you have a poster  Where's the poster  Started tapping it right  Started freaking out about it  Yeah like  You think he was overdoing it  Yeah  Because of what happened yesterday  Yeah  I just made fun  Where's the poster  Well it's funny  Yesterday  He stayed a half hour later  Than usual  30 minutes 
[03:31:30]  Can I  That's how I said  My song  And  And Sal  The intern  I walk in  Because you know  You had this whole blow up  With Paul  Yesterday  About his work ethic  And comparing it to  Sam  Sal  So  I walk in  To the office  After  Paul is gone  And Sal  Looks at me  And he goes  Fuck you by the way  Sam  And I go  Whoa  Sally  Somebody's feeling tough 
[03:32:00]  My goodness  What's the problem buddy  And he says  Because of you  And what you did  On the after show  Paul was following me around  For the last half hour  And just annoying  The shit out of me  Yeah Paul  Paul asked him back there  I go  Hey so what's the biggest  USB drive you can buy  What's on the market today  Ew  Why was he following  Sal around  That's  I don't know  I found it more interesting  That Sal was so annoyed  With Paul following him  That he had to curse me out  Well yeah 
[03:32:30]  Why would you get cursed out  For that  Well he said  Because of what you brought up  On the after show  Yeah that's me  I said  Troy brought it up  And he said  Yeah but you went with it  And I said  I did go with it  I bet you he's the  Knicks fan too  I do have  Who's that  Paul  Yeah  I do have  You know  Somewhat of a  Semblance of control  Of what goes on in here  So I did go with it  But how could you not  Yeah  You know what I mean  Sometimes  Because Troy  Is probably the most  Honest guy on the air here  And when I say honest 
[03:33:00]  I mean honest  To what he feels  Like you can agree  Or disagree  But there's no questioning  That Troy is telling you  How he feels  And so every now and then  He'll come in here  With some shit  That it's just like  Well first Troy goes  Hey this is this  And then he pissed him off  Then boom  I don't feel like  I really take shots  At people  Just out of the blue  I don't think so  But the difference is  People aren't used to  How open and direct  You are  When you do get there  You know what I'm saying  But I mean that should be 
[03:33:30]  I don't know  I think that should be  Everybody really  Don't you think  Yeah  I respect it  I like the directness  And the openness  And every time you watch  A reality show  You know  The judges that are  You know  Mean and open  And honest  Quote unquote  Are the ones that  Everybody loves  So you think  That's the way to be  I just hate pussy  Footing around  You know something  Where you have  A bunch of people in here  And everybody knows  What they want to say  Yeah  But nobody says it  Sal how come  How come Paul bothered you  So much yesterday  Following you around  It was just  Kind of like  I got shit to do 
[03:34:00]  And then I needed  To pull something  For you actually  I came in here to  You know  Get it out of Pro Tools  Where we get the shit from  Oh that was for production  I love you  He's asking all these  Tech questions now  So Paul  Is it true the computer  Runs all in  Blah blah blah blah  Normally whoever's  Doing the phones  Marks certain things  Like if there's a  You know  Jimmy does something funny  Anything like that  And of course the thing  That you needed  Wasn't marks  I was like  Where's the poster  And you were  Did you tell him  Leave me alone  No I didn't tell him  Leave me alone  But he was just  Standing around  And it was like  Did he know 
[03:34:30]  That you were annoyed  By him  I don't think he knew  But he clearly  He didn't know  That I had to do  Extra work  And what was he  What did he want  What do you mean  What do you want  What was he standing  Around for  What was he talking about  Oh he wasn't talking to you  About it  No  Don't get on Paul's case  I'm not getting on Paul's case  I'm not getting on Paul's case  Either  Everything I had to say  To Paul was said yesterday  I was just wondering  Why he would just  Hang out  Bother Sal  But  Let me talk to Paul  Real quick  Is he in there  I'm not gonna  You're not gonna get  Lambasted today Paul  Oh he's gotta put  Headphones on  Paul you're not here 
[03:35:00]  To get lambasted again  You took your beating yesterday  That's a promise  I make to you  How you doing today  I'm alright  Shaken  Well why  First of all  I don't understand  Why Roland is obsessed  With calling you  Posted Paul  Roland like  With everything Roland does  He's blowing me  Asking Eric  If he had post-its  Next to him  Out of proportion  Yeah  Yeah  You blowing it  Out of proportion  You're a post-it  How is it  A rough  Was it rough yesterday  Yeah it was a little rough  Did you talk to Troy  At all after the show  I did  What did you say  I told him  I thanked him actually 
[03:35:30]  He did he Troy  Yeah  Roland's wearing short shorts  And he wants everybody to know  He put his leg up on the table  And he's wearing  Short little Yankees  Athletic shorts  Oh I see the outline of his bag  In his shorts  By the way  Those athletic shorts  Are the only thing  Athletic about Roland  And his shoes  Yeah and his running shoes  He thanked you  Yes  What for?  You're more welcome to say 
[03:36:00]  For being straight up with me  And kind of give me a kick in the ass  That sometimes everybody needs  You needed that yesterday?  Yeah I did  I did  Today you need a post-it  Today you need that post-it  Today I needed a post-it  Today's a post-it  Yesterday it was a life lesson  Today it's a post-it  Yep  What did you need the post-it for?  Just in case for whatever reason  I wasn't in here  The thing that Travis had asked about  I could write it down  So whoever was in here  Besides me  Would know to mark it  What was it?  Oh it was just like a production thing?  Yeah something Travis needs  Like a post-it 
[03:36:30]  Like a post-it  How did you feel coming in today?  Like a dick because I was late  You were late today  I was late today  Oh Paul  How could you be late today?  Yeah  After the conversation we had yesterday  I know  And the clocks moved forward  You spent an extra half hour here  To be like  You know what  I'm turning over a new leaf  And then today you were late?  Today I was late  How did it happen?  Small steps  I couldn't even tell you  I woke up late  My alarm  And you didn't  It wasn't even 
[03:37:00]  You just overslept  There is no reason for it whatsoever  It was just a dick move on  It's not even small steps  It's two steps  It's one step forward  Two steps back  Yes I know  At what point did you just  Yeah you know what  Fuck it  Fuck it dude  Fuck this  Was there any thought  When you  What time did you wake up?  5.15  What time did you usually wake up?  4 o'clock  Oh so you were like  Fuck  Yeah I  I  Just grabbed whatever I could  Throw on  And just ran out the door  Was there any thought  Where you were just like  You know what  Maybe instead of dealing  With the fact that I'm late  After what happened yesterday 
[03:37:30]  I'll hit a tree  How would you say that Roland?  I didn't mean for him  To kill himself  And I didn't say kill  Well you'd probably die  If you hit a tree  No  You don't think so?  Sonny Bono  And that was only  That was person  The tree  This is a vehicle  The tree  Right  So you're implanting  A ton of metal  In between you and the tree  I don't drive  You don't know the  I'm an expert  You don't know the physics  I do not know  Did you ever think  Did you think for a second  Just like  You know what  Fuck it  I'm never gonna talk  To any of those guys again 
[03:38:00]  I'm just gonna disappear  As far as they're concerned  I'm gonna quit  And then never talk to them again  It may have crossed my mind  At one point or two  But I'm not really one  Who fucks up  And then backs down from it  That's not you  No it's not me  You're just a guy  Who fucks up a lot  That's right  And then faces the consequences  You don't fuck up  And then back down from it  You fuck up  And then you come in  And then you fuck up again  Yeah  It's not something you can help  You're just  You're a fuck up  Yeah  Pretty much  Are you feeling better today  Than yesterday  A little bit  That's good  Yeah  And as far as 
[03:38:30]  Sal's concerned  Yeah  Did you know he was annoyed with you  Yeah I did  But the part he left out  Is that he asked me  Where it was  Because he didn't see it marked  So I came in to show him  And just went over it with him  As soon as he figured out  Where it was  I left  Did you know he said  Fuck you Sam  Well first of all  No  He said  You follow him around  For a half hour  And then at 1130  You smacked your  You know  Your legs with your hands  And said  Alright well  I was here for an extra half hour  And then left  That's a little weird 
[03:39:00]  He's denying it  Now that he's standing next to me  He's denying what  That he did that  I think he's on his way in  No that's what he said  He said that you slapped your legs  With your hands  You said  Alright I've been here  An extra half hour  And you left  Paul didn't say  I've been here an extra half hour  And then went home  No he absolutely did  Alright that's what you told me  The whole knee slap thing was  You know  That was irrelevant  Well how else does somebody  Express themselves  I don't know  Paul came in and was like  Well  Maybe it's supposed to  I'm going to do it for an extra half hour  I'm going to get going  He didn't do this  He didn't go like  Well  That's an utter exaggeration 
[03:39:30]  I doubt that  I doubt that  I saw him do it once  I doubt that  I saw him do it once  Everybody does that  That's what you do  When you're like  Well  Time to go  And you slapped your legs like that  Don't try  Paul I think you probably  Slapped your legs  May have happened  I don't remember  That's what I'm saying  Okay  Or sometimes he slaps  Armchair  Something like that  Well time to go  Don't fucking call me a liar  I'm sure he slapped his legs  And  Sal did you  I mean Paul  Did you know Sal was like  To the point where  He was going to be like  Fuck you Sam 
[03:40:00]  You made this idiot  Hang out with me all day  That's the implication  Not the quotes  Yeah I figured Sal  I was fucking getting annoyed  Okay  And what did he want  Like why was he hanging out  I don't know  I was waiting for Eric  He didn't talk to you about anything  Well  Tech talk  No I guess it's just  Tech talk  It's just highly coincidental  That you had the blow up  And then he wanted to stay extra  That's  That's not coincidence  Is it Paul  No not at all  And I also asked Sal  About the biggest USB drive out there  Well the idea of  One 40 gigs for all you have 
[03:40:30]  The idea of wanting to stay later  Was to actually  Do work  Not just hang out  Paul came in  To Danny Travis  In my office  And said hey  Do you guys need anything  From the kitchen  And I started yelling at him  And I told him  I told him  Paul we talked about this  On the air  You shouldn't be asking  If we want anything  From the kitchen  You should be looking  At what's in front of us  And realizing what we need  And filling that void  Yourself without asking  He didn't get me anything  From the kitchen  Needless to say 
[03:41:00]  Are you going to do  The extra half hour today  Or are you going to  I'm going to be here  Later than that  To make up for the lateness  Well that and  Because I have  Something I'm working on  What are you working on  Let's go take a dump  Just building some stuff  For the 6 o'clock hour  What is it  Just  What's the 6 o'clock hour  It's a show  No no  The 5 o'clock hour  Like the filler  Oh the beginning  The beginning  And what's that  Shortening up more stuff bits  Or something  Stuff like that  Production  Yeah production stuff  Like that  All these vagaries  They drive me crazy 
[03:41:30]  It's like I don't know  What's going on around here  You know what I mean  I don't know if Paul  Even knows what's going on  He's not sure about it  He doesn't even know  What he was doing either  Eric was just like  I'll have you do some stuff  For the 6 o'clock hour  Paul was like  Alright  I'm going to be doing some stuff  Stuff  For the 6 o'clock hour  5 o'clock  4  2  Yeah  We're the post-its  And then  Just now  Is when he was questioning  And I said  Isn't 6 o'clock hour  The first hour of the show  And he went  Oh fuck yeah  Shit  Yeah it is  I guess I should have  Thought about that  I didn't know that  I didn't realize  Just kidding Paul 
[03:42:00]  No you're not  No I'm not  Not at all  I was kidding  That time I wasn't  So do we have  Roland's song  Or a piece of it  Or anything  Ask Eric  I think he's working  On it over there  Unless he's just  Getting in position  To blow you  He's down on his knees  He's going to have it  In one minute  Throw that mic on him  I'm excited to hear  Roland's song  Yeah  I mean if you only  Have a piece of it  I've got three  Three little mini songs  Right now  I'm just loading them  Into the system  So we can play it  Okay so just give me 
[03:42:30]  A minute  Okay  I know you recorded me  Well you have to realize  That when you are  In a studio  Yes sir  You pick up a guitar  Yep that's me  And you start singing  Yep  Literally  With two microphones  That are plugged in  Next to you  Oh they're plugged in  We don't unplug  The mics during the commercials  That's not generally  An industry  I mean Troy  You've been in more studios  Than me  Well that  I just bring the guest in  I don't know about  In record studios  Like when they're  Recording albums 
[03:43:00]  Yeah  Once somebody's  Like between songs  Do they unplug the microphone  No  No they wouldn't  See I just bring the guest  In and I don't know  About all the technical shit  Now you do  You see this wire  Yeah I do  Watch this  See how it's right there  Without this wire  Nobody would hear my voice  Which people may prefer  I don't know  But that's how you know  It's plugged in  Oh I know  I thought those never worked  I'm surprised Roland  Didn't make a bribe  To not have this played  Any kind of bribe  Or you just  Fuck it  Just play it  Just play it 
[03:43:30]  Roland still has me  Barbecue and a handjob  I know  The barbecue before Bruce  Didn't count  No because I paid for mine  Oh alright  So that doesn't count  I heard that your  Chick  I don't know if she's  Your girlfriend  I don't know what  Your relationship is  And I don't want to  Overstep my bounds  Yeah girlfriend  But go ahead  I heard the lady in your life  Met Roland  Yeah  What did she think of him  Oh she loves him  Yesterday  I can't remember who  There were some girls  In the office  And I pointed out  That Roland's shirt  Was riding up on him  As he sat down  Yeah  And you could see  That his Hanes briefs 
[03:44:00]  Were on inside out  It was dark  In my apartment  His tighty whities  Because Roland wears briefs  And his tighty whities  That he was wearing  They're always  By the way  Frequently  Are stretched out  And have holes in them  Yeah  In the waistband  You can see them  Because his shirt rides up  When he sits down  Hanes was written  On the waistband  Backwards  Making it clear  That he had put  His tighty whities  On inside out  I said it was dark  In my apartment  And he had dressed  In the dark teeth  Well luckily  My girl had a chance  To see Roland 
[03:44:30]  In his full glory  She really saw  The Bruce thing  Yeah he was in  Rare rare rare form  Yeah  So it was  It was quite a spectacle  I was pumped  And then  This guy  Club Soda Kenny  Yesterday  The past two days  On the after  After the after show  He texted me all day  Saying that  Hey Sam  You and Troy  Are starting a gossip show  Bah bah bah bah bah bah  Yeah he kept saying it to me  Today  I just  I wasn't in the mood  To deal with it  Well what Kenny  He needs to realize  Is he's the biggest gossip 
[03:45:00]  Of anybody  And he makes shit up  And tells everyone  I know  I know  He loves the gossip  Loves it  Loves it  Loves it  Loves it  Can't get enough of it  My dad also emailed me  But that was more based on  The country music conversation  We were having  Yeah  And he was saying  You know  You gotta get in further  With that  Because he doesn't  He doesn't like  Cause I told you  I was raised on country music  And he didn't want  Country music as a whole  To be bashed  And he actually made  Some good points  You know  We were talking about  How the crossover stuff  People forget  That like artists 
[03:45:30]  Like Lady Antebellum  And Taylor Swift  Keith Urban  And  To some extent  Keith Urban  But like  Legitimate  Pop artists  That are actually like  Respective  Carrie Underwood  Carrie Underwood  These are also  Country music artists  Schneider Twain  Right  You know what I mean  It still exists  Like you can get down  With a Taylor Swift song  I would imagine  I mean it doesn't bother me  I wouldn't own any  Of her records  Mean  That was a good one  Why you have to be  So mean  You don't like that song  No  I'm more of a fan  Of classic  Country 
[03:46:00]  I don't really care  For the new stuff  It's a little too  Bubble gummy for me  But  I don't know  It's just my opinion  I mean I don't really  Live in that area  If I lived in that area  And that's what  Everybody's listening to  Maybe I'd be influenced by it  But  I don't know man  I have no  I really have no  Interest in  Country music  I have an interest  In Sam's mom's  Carrot kick  Is that a sexual innuendo  Or literally the  Bacon  Oh no no  Literally just the  Bacon  Okay  I don't know  I gotta clarify  Marcos and Yonkers  You're on after  Opie and Anthony live  As we anxiously  Anticipate Roland's  Singing debut  Oh boy  What's going on Sam 
[03:46:30]  How you doing buddy  I'm alright  Listen  I'm calling in  Because I need  Some advice  From you guys  Especially from you  And Troy  Because I know you guys  Get a lot of hate  I am getting  An incredible amount  Of hate on Twitter  From these fucking  Assholes that are jealous  Because I call in  The show all the time  What are they saying  You're just calling in  Although Danny  Smashed you good  In the first hour  But  Well I mean  Just different stuff  Like it started  Because they were jealous  Because I'm calling in 
[03:47:00]  All the time  I get through  You guys  Sometimes talk about me  And they're saying  Really cruel stuff  I tried to block them  What are they saying  But they're making  Fake accounts  To fucking follow me  And troll on what I'm saying  You're a celebrity  I'm sorry guys  You're a celebrity  At this point Marcos  I didn't know the show  Had that much influence  Dude  I didn't know that  The hate  That you guys get  Is brushing off on me  Which is crazy  Like what do you do Sam  Because I know  A lot of people  Hate on you 
[03:47:30]  Yeah well I mean  I don't really block  Very much anymore  I used to block more  I don't  Every now  When it's just like  Nonsense  I block  But sometimes I can tell  When people are just  Trying to get blocked  I just ignore everybody  I just ignore it  I almost never respond  Roland doesn't ignore anybody  He blocks and he responds  And he says horrible things  But I don't think  You know  You can't give people  That much credibility  Because if people  Are tweeting you  And you don't know  Who they are  But they know who you are  Because obviously  If they're saying shit about you 
[03:48:00]  They know who you are  And if you don't know  Who they are  You're automatically  On a higher pedestal  Than they are  So the last thing  That you want to do  Is lower yourself  To the scummy level  That they live on  And also  You know  If you're confident  Marcos  In your calls  Keep making the calls  And eventually  People will turn around  Like  I get way  Less hate  Now  Than I did  A year ago  And then 
[03:48:30]  I got less hate  Than I did  Two years ago  Because people  Started to  See me as a more  Multidimensional person  On the air  I assume  But  That's what I would say  Marcos  Okay  Well thanks a lot  Before you hang up  We should go to  Jack in North Dakota  What's up Jack  Hey Sam  How you doing buddy  Hey Marcos  Are you really crying  About being cyber bullied buddy  Well no  I'm not crying about it  I'm just complaining  Because these fucks  Don't stop  Crying 
[03:49:00]  Complaining  Actually no no no  You know what  No you know what  I'm sorry  I'm actually  I didn't call in  For actual advice  I just wanted to  Prove the power  That I had  That I can call  And get through  And get on live  With primetime  Sam Roberts  That's the reason  Why I called  Oh so it's a power  Trip with you then  You're not crying  Yeah I'm popular  Yeah exactly  You're popular  Don't hate  Oh you're a popular  You're a popular boy  You're sitting at the  Popular table market  Yeah  I said a popular  Table market  Hey mom  Would you suck my thing 
[03:49:30]  Hey  Hey  We don't  We don't cry  At the popular table market  Speak some fucking  English  You're like  Shut the fuck up  Go fuck your mother's mouth  Wow  I said wait up  I'm done with this argument  Marcos have a good day  Jack have a good day  Marcos really does get hate  But why  I don't know  I don't know what the problem is  Like I never thought  Like he does always get in  He's always got something to say  I feel like Marcos makes good points 
[03:50:00]  Yeah  It's never like remarkable  Right  Like he's not like  Steve from Bayshore  Who's throwing lines in  And you're like  Oh shit  That was pretty funny  It's just like  Okay  Marcos made a good point there  We can expand on that  And keep the conversation going  Yeah  I don't understand  Maybe it's cause Kurt Love  I don't know if Kurt Love  Another super fan  Is mad at him  Because  He hasn't been talked about  Because the guy he's dating  Bobo  Hasn't been back on the show  I don't know what it is  So Marcos and Kurt  Has some beef  It could be 
[03:50:30]  That Kurt  He twitters  Hey what's going on  Well cause he's  I don't know what's going on  Because  I'd rather him and Bobo  Leave him alone  And let them live their lives  Yeah  Um  In love  Eric do we have a little  Music to play for the people  Oh do we  Is it  Do you like it  We have five cuts  Okay well  Maybe we'll see how many cuts  We actually play  They're all very short  Okay let's play  This is uh  Uh  Roland  During the commercial break  Before after  Opie and Anthony live 
[03:51:00]  Who came in here  And this  By the way  Oh Sam's a shitster  Blah blah blah  Roland walked in here  I didn't say a word to him  He picked up the guitar  Off the couch  And he started singing  About Paul  And his post-its  And his mother  Let's listen to some of it  Oh I forgot  What the chart is this  I don't know  It's been here for a week  Paul  Where is the post-it  Where is the post-it  My name is Paul 
[03:51:30]  Eric get a post-it  Get a post-it  My name is Paul  I tried to work hard  Now we can  Troy y'all let me  I wish we were  Troy doesn't like me  Anymore  This is what he does  Paul you piece of shit  You piece of shit  Troy still hates you  Because you're fake working today  Fake working  This is what Roland does  And God hates you too  What was the last thing you said? 
[03:52:00]  God hates you too  Did he just say  God hates Paul too?  Yeah  I'm sorry  I talked over that  This is what people  Don't understand  Roland is worse  Off the air  Than he is on the air  Awful  100%  How many times a week  Do you get prank called  By Roland Troy?  10  10 plus  10 times in a 5 day work week  Yeah  Not true  I just have to literally  Turn off my phone  Not true  You want to play another clip?  No  Troy are you enjoying the  Oh I love it 
[03:52:30]  You do  So you want to hear  A little more of  Roland's Paul song?  Please  Okay  I don't  Paul doesn't know  Shit shit shit  Shit shit shit  Shit shit shit  Paul can't even  Answer the phones  Cause they ring ring ring  Ring ring ring  Ring ring ring  Hey Sal  Do you have a post-it?  Eric do you have a post-it?  I have an idea  Wait  It came from Travis  You worthless piece of  Cocksucker  Do you need this paper sound?  Is this yours?  You worthless piece of  Cocksucker  Is that what you called him? 
[03:53:00]  It was  I'm an artist  I was trying to  Work out a song  Eric find out for me  How does Paul feel  That Roland was in here  With the guitar  Singing songs  About how he's a  Worthless piece of  Cocksucker  Paul how do you feel?  How does that make you feel Paul?  I'm pretty honored  That Roland would  Immortalize me in song  Well he called you  A worthless piece of  Cocksucker  No I didn't call it him  It was just a song  With reference  No no no the song  Actually the lyric is  Paul is a worthless piece  Of Cocksucker  Yeah I probably could have  Done without that  Yeah that one is  What hurts more  Being worthless 
[03:53:30]  Or being a piece  Of Cocksucker  I think worthless  Would rank higher  For me  For being hurting more  Do you think it hurts more  Because you were so late today?  Oh definitely  Okay  So I hate myself  A little bit already  You know  Yeah so this is just  Putting salt in the wound  Absolutely  Okay  Well I hate to see  That Paul hates himself  On that note  We should listen  To a third track  Why don't you hit it again  Eric  No  Troy yelled at Paul  Paul cried like a  Cocksucking bitch  Yeah 
[03:54:00]  Thank you  No thank you  Thank you  See you in the heart  Did you call  Did you say  To the tune of  Here Comes the Bride  Troy yelled at Paul  Paul cried like a  Cocksucking bitch  You're so hurtful  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not a lyricist  Are you proud of yourself?  No  You are aren't you?  No because I didn't  Know you recorded it 
[03:54:30]  Troy is rolling  Proud of himself  Oh yeah  Yeah he loves it  He's a little embarrassed  But he knows that  He thinks he's funny  And he's like  No  But he loves doing this  Off the air  Yeah  He hates it when  All the ears are open  His best material  Is when it's just  You and him  Yeah  He hates it  When everybody's ears  Are open  I do  That's why I like  That's why I did it  For you guys  That's the difference  Between me and Roland  I've upset a lot of people  But ears are always open  It doesn't matter  You'll take it on the air  Off the air  Whatever  I say the same things  You've seen me around  Different people  Yeah yeah no  I just don't 
[03:55:00]  Roland prefers to make  A couple jokes  Off the air  Privately  And on that note  Why don't we hear  The fourth track  Why don't we hear  The fourth track  Of Roland and Paul  The song  My name is Paul  Rock it out  I'm a big day  And it's like  Look mysterious  They'll post it  They'll post it  Troy yelled at me  Troy said I don't work hard  I agree with him 
[03:55:30]  What do you do for the show Paul  I do nothing  I just say  Where's the post it  I said where's the post it  Hey  Hey I got an idea  Yeah  Wait that's your idea Sam  But I got a post it  I wrote it down  Now it's my idea  Cause I'm Paul  Look at my bandana  I'm badass  Girl  You may or may not know this  Paul wears a bandana  Every day  That would help explain  Roland 
[03:56:00]  Thoughts  Play another clip  That's what he  And this is the last clip  Eric  It's very short  It's the very end  Oh no  No this is the  Oh no  I don't work on Fridays  I don't work on Mondays  I don't work on Tuesdays  Cause I'm Paul  Yeah yeah  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Wow  I don't work on Mondays  I don't work on Tuesdays  And you can hear  If you listen closely to that clip  Play that clip again  Uh  Listen  Listen  Listen  To the strategy  Of Roland 
[03:56:30]  Okay  Listen  To when  Roland's song stops  And listen  And listen to what's in the background  Listen to the ambient noise  Alright  You can hear the studio monitors  And the production that's playing  That was on this channel  Just  30 minutes ago  Alright here we go  I don't work on Fridays  I don't work on Mondays  I don't work on Tuesdays  Cause I'm Paul  Yeah yeah  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  What'd you hear Troy  Like right before the microphones get cracked  To come live on the air  The intro for the after show 
[03:57:00]  Was halfway over  And he put the guitar down  And walked over to the table  You deserve this Roland  You piece of cocksucker  I apologize  I think one day though  Roland's kind of  Becoming at the verge  Of where he's just gonna snap  I have this feeling  And I have a feeling  That all the banter off air  Will just  He's just gonna come on air  And just  Troy  Who do you think  Roland is gonna snap on  That's a good question  Whoever  Pops the pin  Whoever has the pin  Can I tell you 
[03:57:30]  Who I think  Roland is gonna snap on  Who  Me  No I think there's some people  Ahead of you  No this is what's gonna happen  Roland is gonna be pissed off  By everyone else  He's gonna take it all in  Because Roland and me  Play fight all day  Right  We just start yelling  At each other all day  So he's comfortable  That's true  Yelling at me  And he's comfortable  Being real with me  Yeah but he won't go  To weird places with you  But here's what'll happen  He'll get mad at every  Cause there aren't weird places  To go with me  I'm very open about everything  Right  He will be mad 
[03:58:00]  About something you said  And he'll be mad  About something Eric said  He'll be mad  About something Danny said  And he'll keep it all in  Cause he doesn't want  To get into it  And then I'll just be like  Shut the fuck up Roland  And that's it  That's the snap  Yeah  He'll snap at me  But all the venom  That he has towards everybody else  Will start to spew  Like a geyser  Yeah I agree with that  He definitely does  He has misdirected anger  I'll  Something that I'll say  That will be  Meaningless 
[03:58:30]  Right  It will have nothing behind it  Will be the thing  That pushes Roland  Over the top  Yeah  Yeah he has a lot of anger  Towards a lot of people  But he will not  Vent his true anger  Unless  Push comes to shove  Cause he's done it before  You don't have a  Quick clip of Roland angry  Do you?  If you don't  I mean we've done a lot of  We just played Roland  Let me look  Don't worry about it  Cause we gotta  I wanna play some other stuff  Big family underwear  You son of a bitch  Yeah really?  Yeah  Blue bowl  Blue bowl  That's what's on my shirt  You have Yankees shorts on  That don't cover your knees 
[03:59:00]  I think Roland  I have Yankees fever  I think Roland has a big penis  You do Troy  I do  This is interesting Troy  You bring this up out of nowhere  You think Roland has a  A giant  A giant wad in his pants  I hadn't thought about this  My mom like  Are we saying that to kill  A big burrito  A big burrito  Well because he wears  These tight tight shorts  Yeah  In honor of some people  And I just  I see the outline  Of his genitalia  It's so tight  Who do you wear  The tight shorts  In honor of 
[03:59:30]  Look at him  He's gonna pop  He can't breathe  I don't know  Who he wears  Tight shorts  In honor of  Who is it in honor of  I don't know  No  Jesus  Jesus  Jesus  Who do you wear  The tight shorts in  In honor of  What does that mean  I don't know  What does it mean 
[04:00:00]  I don't know  What he's laughing at  What  Does a person  Who wears tight shorts  That this is in honor of  Does he work here  No  That's a lie  So yes  Is the answer  Troy do you have any idea  Eric  Who is Roland's  Tight shorts person  I don't know  I want to find out  Somebody probably wears  Really tight  Who wears really tight pants  I don't know  I don't know  Like it's a guy  I'm sure  So it would have  It would have to  Huh  It would have to be 
[04:00:30]  Somebody with a camel toe  Yeah  I would think  A male  I don't know  A male camel toe  Maybe one of the executives  No  Definitely not  Couldn't be an executive  Right  On air host  Travis  Who wears  Have you heard Roland  Breaking down in here  Yeah  Who wears  First of all  Roland is so unprepared  For any of this  To come up on the air  For his  Bullshit to come up on the air  Who wears the tight pants  Did you  I know  You do  I know what Roland told me  But you won't say the name 
[04:01:00]  I don't know  Okay  I don't like everyone  I'm scared of Roland  Are you scared of the person  In another  You wouldn't be scared of them  Because you're not saying it  But  Are you scared  Of the person  If you had said that  About them  Is it a bad idea  If I'm Roland  Yeah  No  No  Roland  He doesn't care  He doesn't have any authority  Over Roland  Yeah  He does have authority  Over Roland  Sure  I mean  Look  Everyone above  Our position  Has authority over us 
[04:01:30]  Right  Yeah  Don't point at me  Roland's pointing at me  And mouthing you  Son of a bitch  I like how you're assuming  It's just one person  Is it multiple people  Because Roland  Don't you have a  Fucking funny catch  You asshole  Roland said it's in honor  Of someone  Roland said it's in honor  I'm not saying any names  But I'll say I know  But don't you have  Like a flight to catch  To Anaheim  You know  For WonderCon  I'm going to Anaheim  Later today  For WonderCon  I enjoy my friendship  With Roland  You know what time  My flight is

[04:02:30]  Like he talks  All kinds of shit  And he makes  Horrible  Inappropriate jokes  About people  Who if they heard  Would be very offended  Have power over Roland  Like he can't say the things  That he says  So when we get him  In here  And he's comfortable  He ends up  Starting to say some shit  And then he starts  Laughing at himself  Because he realizes  He just  Put his foot in his mouth  Oh I wish he'd just  Let it rip  One person would be  Really disappointed  If they found out 
[04:03:00]  I think I'm starting to  Is it a person  Who has been disappointed  By what other people  On this channel  Have said about him  Yeah but I mean  That's like  That could be  Ten different people  Yeah  Yeah  Twenty-five  Yeah  Yeah  But it's the guy  I'm thinking  Um I don't know  I don't know  If it's the guy  You're thinking  No  Oh not that guy  Is it that guy  Roland  You know what  I'm doing right now  It's the best impression

[04:08:30]  I do appreciate your support  Yeah  And I don't lie  Yes you do  Did you wear a hat yesterday?  Yeah  Okay so I told the truth  Goodbye Kenny  Alright goodbye busy buddies  Hang up on him  You see what we have to deal with here?  Roland is over here  Talking shit off the air  And then going crazy  When he comes on the air  Kenny is making up bullshit  And reading it off to everybody  And Roland's always surprised  When it comes up on the air  Yeah you talk crazy shit 
[04:09:00]  Crazy shit  I didn't think you were going to say that  You talk the craziest shit  You don't think  That when I'm sitting back there  Laughing my balls off  At the shit that you're saying  You don't think that I'm going to  Eventually talk about it on the air?  No I trust you  There is  You trust Sam?  Listen  I just told Troy  There's not a lot  If you get to know me off the air  It's not an interesting thing  Because you know it already  I know  That's why I'm easy when  He smashed Daniel's banana 
[04:09:30]  Well yeah he did  Yesterday  Alright  Roland  Steve Sturniolo  He works on Raw Dog  On air  Yeah he's  He's on the air  What do you mean by that?  He's on air talent  Is he?  Yes sir  How do you know?  I thought he was just a producer  No sir  How did you find that out?  The company email  The newsletter?  Yeah he said Troy is the producer  All the new titles  And what did you say about Steve Sturniolo?  On air  On air talent  So Roland has decided 
[04:10:00]  Not to let Steve forget about that  I mean he probably wouldn't let me forget about that  But it doesn't apply to me  He didn't let  Yeah yeah I'm a producer  He didn't let Steve Sturniolo forget about that  He reminds him  It's weird  He reminds him of it every day  And yesterday Steve Sturniolo left his desk  And Roland went over for no reason  Smashed his banana  And then left it on top of a Mike Birbiglia CD on his desk  I thought that was a more of an insult  Which I didn't get at all  To the banana? 
[04:10:30]  But  And then Roland and I left  I don't know what the outcome of that was  So your bad banana and bad comedy equals  You're not a fan of Birbiglia  No I mean  I'd known him for years  And then the man at the party  Hey what's up?  And he ran away from me  He big timed you  Yeah  Like ah don't be a dick  Has he changed since he did that thing in the store window?  Or since he has a sleeping problem  Or whatever  I've heard of him  I've heard he say sleepwalks  Cause wasn't  He should get a sleepwalk into someone's foot and his ass 
[04:11:00]  You got into a fight with Voss on the air a few years ago  Wasn't Birbiglia on your side that day or no?  Yeah that's when he needs help now  He's a big time  Now he's all good  Mike Big time  Yeah  And I don't think Voss likes Birbiglia at all  No Voss doesn't like him at all  They got into a big fight that day too  Cause he took a shot at him today  Yeah well I  I didn't know if we were gonna point that out so literally  I thought it was just gonna be swept under the rug  Nah  But he did  Um  Well listen  Yeah he was 
[04:11:30]  Hopefully Anthony's feeling better  Um  It's not like him  And by  And Eric  Can I tell you something?  Yeah  I apologize  The last two days  I swear to god  I intend to play these clips that I asked you to pull  Oh yeah  It's alright  Cause I wanted to play the Jimmy in the elevator clips  No look  It's fine because we got Radio Gold out of Roland today  You understand these things happen  That had to take preference over everything  Like yesterday  Like can I be honest with you?  Mmhmm  On Tuesday  When I started a fight with you  Mmhmm  I didn't have shit to play  I had no clips 
[04:12:00]  And you know this cause you're the one who cuts out the clips  Yeah  Uh yesterday I had clips to play  But I couldn't give up on the Paul and Troy discussion  And today I had clips to play  But I couldn't give up on this Roland thing  Not by a long shot  Um  So I do appreciate though  That you go to the work  Even though you know that things come up here  Um  Hopefully Ant's feeling better  You know  Shitting it out  Shitting it out  Yeah  Hopefully he can get all that uh  Uh Italian food shit out of his system  I'm assuming that's what it was 
[04:12:30]  Cause he was out of here  Um  But  Regardless  Uh  I uh  We will be back  I won't be here tomorrow  Uh  I hope you will be  The audience  I'm gonna be in Anaheim  I'll be on WonderCon radio  All weekend  So  I guess listen to that  If that's your thing  If you don't like me  Don't  Because you're a fucking idiot  If you do  I don't want to hear about it  Huh  That's not nice  Well it's still  It'd be a fucking  Pretty dumb thing to do  Everyone has opinions  Kermit the Frog  Kermit the Frog  And Walter
