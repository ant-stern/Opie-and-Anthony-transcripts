<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a bizarre song about killing kittens, immediately setting the tone for the rest of the program.  This was followed by a caller’s sexually suggestive anecdote about a Gay Pride parade. Another caller, advertising sexual services in Nevada and claiming to have Tourette’s Syndrome, engaged in a sexually explicit conversation with the hosts, including requests for women of different races and a dwarf.

The show then launched into a discussion about a biologist’s claim that rape is biologically ingrained in men.  This sparked a heated debate with callers and featured a guest appearance by Mike Tyson, who used graphic and misogynistic language to express his views. Trish, a female guest in the studio, described her interest in rough sex. The segment was heavily laced with sexually explicit and violent language.

Next, the hosts engaged in a racially charged discussion about the lack of minority representation on “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?”, using derogatory remarks about various ethnic and racial groups.  Caller Vinny offered his perspective.  Two female police officers then staged a simulated arrest of Opie, Anthony, and a guest named Rick, with a physical struggle and commentary on the duration and force of each arrest.

The show then featured Don Imus as a guest.  The conversation was highly profane and sexually suggestive, covering various news stories including people rescued from a building, a grandmother fighting off carjackers, Kathy Lee Gifford, and the Million Youth March.  Imus used homophobic slurs, discussed his sexual dysfunction and physical ailments graphically, and engaged in vulgar jokes and insults with the hosts and callers. The discussion veered into a bizarre news story about a naked man found dead on top of a killer whale named "Till I Come," with speculation on the cause of death.  Popeye the Sailor Man (a voice impersonator) added nonsensical and sexually suggestive commentary.

Later, Opie recounted his frustrating experience at the DMV, and a Corky Steinbrenner impersonator made numerous profane references to deceased celebrities. The show concluded with another vulgar joke and a song about killing kittens.  A mention of Steven Lynch was made earlier in the show.

The broadcast also included a segment recounting a physical altercation between guest Rick and two women who subdued him, resulting in a bloody nose for Rick.  The hosts reacted with amusement.  Reverend Al called in to promote his website, including a video game called "Tawana Raiders 3."  The hosts discussed the changing popularity of names over time, leading to sexually explicit discussions. They also speculated on Courtney Cox dropping her last name after marrying David Arquette and briefly mentioned a book about Ronald Reagan's dislike of George H.W. Bush.  A Tom Brokaw impersonation concluded the show, detailing a fantastical scuba diving trip in search of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s body and reporting on the Leon Klinghoffer murder, ending with a humorous exchange about Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, here he comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel and a Human show.  1027 WNEW.  We just talked about our discussions about old bands.  Oh, geez, very important to world peace.  And this person is so pissed, he says,  Stop picking on has-beens.  I bet that you will be doing the news like Imus 20 years from now.  66 WFAG with my big cowboy hat on. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  I got my bandana around my neck.  Yeah.  And I plug my brother's salsa now.  That's what I do on the show.  Yeah.  It's good stuff.  Yeah.  It's 6.13, 13 minutes after 6 o'clock.  Imus in the morning.  It is a good show, huh?  Yeah.  You want to talk about stuff in the news, Imus?  Well, shut up, McCord. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  See that jerk?  What the hell's his name?  I don't even know.  Imus in the morning, 6.13 and 22 seconds.  Well, let me get the paper to help you out.  Baby.  Moby Worm coming to you.  It's a privilege to have you in the studio, Mr. Imus.  I know.  Let's use your time wisely here.  So, I want to see you riff a little bit on us.  Wait a minute.  The minute hand just changed.  Imus in the morning. 
[00:01:30]  66 WFAG.  It's 6.14.  All right.  Quack, quack.  Quack, quack.  What do you think of the two guys that were saved from the 12-story plunge?  Were they on a building?  Yeah.  Look on the front page.  Front page of the paper.  There's a picture of them.  What do you think of them?  My bifocals.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  I got to tie my bandana back around my neck.  My neck wrinkles went right over the paper here. 
[00:02:00]  I can't reel this in.  Okay.  Imus in the morning.  It's not 6.15 yet.  It's 6.14, 22 seconds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  So, what do you think of the guys they saved from that building yesterday?  Well, you got to be a jerk on the outside of a building.  Baby.  All right.  That was pretty good.  I'm riffing.  Okay.  What do you think of the grandma in Jersey that stopped the hijackers?  God.  Dope old broad.  The carjackers, I should say.  Yeah.  No. 
[00:02:30]  She was 81 years old.  81.  81.  Wow.  Could be my kid sister.  And she was getting...  Time to play a Billy Saul Huggers bit?  No.  Not yet.  No.  You could do another...  Imus in the morning.  6.15.  Okay.  Very good.  Whack, whack.  Okay.  Whack, whack.  What do you think of the grandma that was getting carjacked, though?  81 years old in Jersey.  She fought off this guy instead of giving up her car.  Now she's a jerk.  She's a jerk?  No.  No.  And he's a jerk.  Why? 
[00:03:00]  Well, that's what I do.  I just say people are jerks.  Imus in the morning.  66 F-A-G.  Look, I got my cowboy hat on.  Yeah, I see that.  Living work in Manhattan, and I dress like a cowboy fag.  Right.  Well, there's a lot of cattle.  Imus in the morning.  6.15.  33 seconds.  There's a lot of cattle in mid-town.  Whack, whack.  Right.  Where's McCord?  You want to do a little riff on Kathy Lee going bra-less on Regis and Kathy Lee?  You must have a good comment about that.  Chip and cans on them.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw those.  They hang like my neck wrinkles.  I'm inventing the Imus in the morning neck bra.  Oh, yeah?  To hold my neck fat up.  I see.  Like big bosoms.  Well, didn't you start your own promotion kind of like a Whip Him Out Wednesday, but you  have a little different...  Whip out your neck fat, baby.  Right.  When you're on the highway?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, shut up.  You missed your time check.  Imus in the morning.  66 F-A-G.  Yeah.  6-16. 
[00:04:00]  Very good.  Quack, quack.  Um, I...  Shut up.  You want to riff on anything else in the news?  God, they're all jerks.  Just a bunch of morons.  What about the Million Youth March?  That's coming up soon.  You must have something on there.  Khalid Muhammad.  What a jerk.  Just a dope.  Imus in the morning.  Would you like to take some calls from your listeners?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, put one of those phone lines in there.  All right. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know if they're going to want to talk to you.  Uh, Joe, you're on Imus in the morning.  Who's this?  It's, uh, Don Imus.  Hey, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're about, uh, the 83-year-old lady.  Yeah, you're a jerk.  Hey, listen to this guy.  Listen to him, McCord.  What do you think about that, Imus?  Yeah.  Baby, what?  What do you think about that, Imus?  Uh, my hearing aid came loose.  I wasn't able to hear you, baby.  Yeah?  Hey, Imus, how's that hot life of yours doing?  How's that hot life of yours doing, Imus?  I don't know.  So, I haven't been able to, uh, get an erection in about 20 years. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, baby.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  I'm going to use my bandana to try to tie up my, uh, swing.  See if that works.  You know what's like staring at a young hottie like my wife?  Yeah.  And, uh, no blood flows down there?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm pretty depressing.  No wonder I'm a miserable prick.  Yeah, baby.  Imus in the morning, 618, 12 seconds.  Quack, quack, quack.  Baby! 
[00:05:30]  Would you like to talk to more of your listeners, uh, Mr. Imus?  We only have you for a few more minutes here.  I think it's, uh, nap time for Don Imus.  I'm a little tired.  My throat hurts.  Well, I see.  Kind of hard to do this.  Well, there's one more question for, uh, for you.  All right, baby.  Alan, you're on the air.  Don Imus.  Imus in the morning.  WFG.  Imus, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  How come you're on 102 stationers?  Opie and Anthony still got more fans than you, you freaky twinkerbell? 
[00:06:00]  I, uh, didn't hear what he said, but everyone's laughing, so I'll do it, too.  I don't know which one of you guys does that, Imus.  That is absolutely the...  That's better than himself.  That's amazing.  No, Alan.  Well, it's, uh, it's actually Imus in the morning here in the studio.  Yeah.  No, Alan, you got to understand, we work for the same company, and I, and Mr. Imus likes  to stop in to our show every once in a while to make sure we're doing okay.  Someone, uh, send my colostomy bag.  Got my colostomy bag.  Yeah.  See you now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I keep it in my hat, baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Here's a little pump that I store in my, uh, bandana.  Pump's the, uh, well, get the picture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up, McCord.  All right, uh, Jim, you got a question for Imus.  We only have him for a few minutes here.  Yeah, are you, uh, you gonna get into the gay porn there with that little scarf you were on your head?  Get into.  Well, I've been doing gay porn for years, baby.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Imus in the morning, WFAG, time check 619.  Quack, quack.  How's Imus's, uh, voice holding out over there? 
[00:07:00]  Kind of hurts.  It kind of hurts?  There's a few more people that want to talk to Mr. Imus, though.  Well, uh, maybe...  We'll see how long Mr. Imus can talk like Mr. Imus.  Maybe Mr. Imus should, uh, take a...  Or it turns into Reverend Al.  Maybe Mr. Imus should take a swig of his beer over there.  That might help him out a little bit, okay?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Baby.  All right, why don't you take a sip of that beer, Mr. Imus.  Uh, Steve, what's up?  Imus, you old goat?  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  You didn't, uh, appreciate the Billy Saul Hargis bits that, uh, I used to do? 
[00:07:30]  Let me ask you a question.  Imus in the morning, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How in the hell did you get that young, uh, ice-skating wife?  What the hell did you do?  Uh, a lot of cash and...  Did you keep blind?  A lot of cash and dope.  A lot of dope?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  She's hoping I drop dead, baby.  She gets the Imus compound, which consists of my, uh, hat, my gay fag cowboy hat collection.  Yeah, there's only two kinds of people that wear cowboy hats in New York, you know, right?  Cowboys and fags?  You know that, right?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ain't no cowboy, baby.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I guess it makes you a feet-a-pump behind me. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, you're all here.  All right, Steve, thank you.  Adios.  That was a great question for Mr. Imus.  Later.  All right.  Uh, Rich, what's up?  Yeah, Rich, question for, um, Don Imus.  Is there Imus there?  Yeah, yeah.  Imus in the morning.  Hey, you guys.  I want to know something.  Yeah.  How come, how come Opie and Anthony are always allowed to get into, uh, ripping on you and,  uh, and everybody else who works for this big conglomerate, but they can't touch Stern?  Oh, how? 
[00:08:30]  Um, well, I...  How come the manager doesn't let him, uh, go off on Stern?  But I saw Stern was stealing all your material.  I've been doing, uh, having a gay relationship with Howard for, uh, many years now.  Me and, uh, me and Howard go, uh, yeah, we go both ways, boys and men.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Greg, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I want to know how I'm, uh, Mr. Imus.  How did you deal with the Y-19K problem?  Uh, huh?  Huh?  What? 
[00:09:00]  The Y-19K problem when all the clocks turned 1,900.  What'd you do?  Yeah, I was back at the, uh, turn of the, uh, century, right?  Did you have to reboot your abacus?  That's funny, baby.  All right, you guys suck.  All right, thank you.  All right, yeah.  Man, a lot of good questions for you, sir.  Uh, you got a question for Imus?  Imus in the morning, 622.  Uh, no, no, no, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  Uh, two more seconds.  I got a question.  Imus in the morning, W-F-A-G, 623. 
[00:09:30]  I don't want to tell you.  The salsas suck.  Uh, my brother's salsa?  Yeah, you'd suck.  I'm thinking of putting my picture on the front.  Big, just call it fag salsa.  It doesn't sell.  Big cowboy hat wearing fag salsa.  Fag salsa, baby.  Hey, O.B. and Anthony, you guys suck.  All right.  I got to wear my spurs.  Right.  And when I'm riding my boyfriend, I could spur him.  Jay, what's up?  Jay, you're on with Don Imus, a legend. 
[00:10:00]  You said you could do a colostomy bag under your cowboy hat.  Yeah.  I guess we could say you're truly a s***head.  Yeah, baby.  Speaking of thumbs.  I'm a craphead.  Talk to you later, man.  You guys suck.  Oh, Jay, that was a good one.  Too good, man.  Too bad that didn't make the error.  Dick, what's going on?  Dick.  I wanted to ask you.  Yeah.  I haven't seen mine in a while, baby.  Shriveled up like a raisin.  I think my neck is wrinkled.  You ought to see that thing. 
[00:10:30]  Looks like a tortoise head been left out in the sun.  Real small tortoise, huh?  So what's up, bud?  Yeah, I want to ask him if he ever did a socket to me.  Well, I gave McCord the rusty trombone.  Right there, McCord?  Yeah.  He enjoyed it.  I gave him a reach around, a couple of tugs.  Yeah, baby.  Hey, my throat really hurts.  Okay.  We're going to have to wrap up our little segment with Mr. Ivers.  His throat hurts. 
[00:11:00]  Ain't nothing Budweiser's going to fix, neither.  No.  Yeah, baby.  Well, thanks for stopping by today.  Thank you, uh, you should, uh, kiss my wrinkled ass for being here.  Yeah.  Legend, Don Imus.  Imus in the morning, 624.  W-F-A-G.  It was really 625 when you said 624.  Oh, damn.  No.  I'm going to put on my pink hat, go down to the village.  Okay.  Go down to Christopher Street, baby. 
[00:11:30]  Where they all dress like cowboy fags.  There he goes.  There he goes.  He's, uh, out the door.  We're going to prance him.  Yes.  I guess we've got to tell people we can't really confirm if that was the actual Don Imus.  Oh, no, Opie, that was indeed Don Imus.  Okay.  There you go. 
[00:12:00]  Story of the day.  We just got to bring it up again.  We started the show with it.  Got a little out there.  There's new development.  There is a huge new development.  Uh, the man who died in the whale tank at SeaWorld down there in Orlando.  The story goes, the guy was hiding.  He waited for the park to close.  Jumps in the tank with the killer whale.  Okay.  Jumps in there, completely naked.  They find him, I believe, this morning or yesterday, dead, still attached to the top of the whale. 
[00:12:30]  The killer whale.  The killer whale.  Look how you're making it sound.  Still attached.  Still attached.  He was found, um, the story laying on top of the whale.  Laying on top of the whale, dead as a doorknob, not floating on the top of the pool, still attached to the killer whale.  And we were just trying to figure out how.  Naked, Anthony.  Naked.  Naked, no clothes, nothing.  What is stuck?  How he stayed on the whale.  What is stuck to the whale?  Hello?  I don't know how he was staying on the whale. 
[00:13:00]  Hello, Mueller.  Hello?  Are you, uh, saying that perhaps he was trying to pleasure himself at the whale's blowhole's expense?  Well, Ant, you come up with something better.  I can't figure out any other way he would have still been there by morning.  If he stayed there, the park closed.  Now, uh, everyone leaves the park.  He figures, now's my chance.  Dives in the killer whale tank.  Takes his clothes off.  In the morning, seven in the morning, whenever they show up and see him, he's on top of the whale. 
[00:13:30]  Well, that is a long time to be up there.  Mm-hmm.  So maybe something had to be fastening him to the, uh, to the whale.  Why isn't anyone else bringing this up in the media?  He was doing the blowhole.  It's obvious.  Well, it is?  I think so.  I think you're, uh, I think you're right.  That's a sick F if that's the deal.  And then we figured, uh, earlier we were saying the blowhole closes up when the whale dives.  Mm-hmm.  So perhaps, as he was, uh, having a little fun, the whale decides to, um, descend. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Closes the blowhole.  Oh!  All right.  Well, there's a, uh, incredible development in this story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The name of the whale.  Yeah, this is very interesting.  I'm not making this up.  The name of the whale that the guy was attached to.  Well, let me spell it out.  Because I don't even know if we can say this on the air. 
[00:14:30]  You can say the whale's name.  Till I come.  Or till it come.  Till it come.  How's it spelled?  Thank you, Anthony.  It's spelled T-I-L-L.  That's till.  Right.  I.  I.  That's I.  Okay.  K-U-M.  That's the name.  That's the whale's name.  That's the name of the whale.  Till I come.  Till I come.  It's till I come.  Till I come.  Who's laughing out there?  Someone laughed outside.  Who's laughing? 
[00:15:00]  Who was that?  It's a Japanese whale.  Who the hell was that?  Who's laughing out there?  That was the whale's name.  It is the whale's name.  It's the whale's name.  The whale's still alive.  Yeah.  I'm gurgling a little, but.  Do you think it was a sperm whale?  Oh, went from a killer whale to a humpback.  Oh, okay, rock.  But that is a very interesting development there.  Read it for yourself in the paper. 
[00:15:30]  Till I come.  Or till I come.  Got to say real fast, I guess.  Till I come.  Till I come.  Till I come.  Was the name of the whale that the guy was stuck to.  Yeah.  You can't write stuff better than this, man.  Yeah.  You can try for hours.  Well, the other whale, Touch-A-Snatch, in the next pen, was uninjured.  I just want to make sure everyone knows that Touch-A-Snatch was fine.  Okay.  Can we bring Popeye in? 
[00:16:00]  Because Popeye, uh, has some experience with, um, with killer whales.  Hey, Popeye.  Yes?  Thanks for coming back on the show.  Ah-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.  Well, blow me.  Down.  Ah-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.  Now, can you.  Give me member.  Now, can you explain this story?  Why a guy would be naked on the back of a killer whale?  Obviously, he was a not-skickle man.  Yeah.  A man of the sea.  Yeah.  Uh, cuz we used to do that-sk. 
[00:16:30]  We'd be out at sea for a long time without any signs-sk-a-pooski.  Ah-ka-ka-ka-ka.  Ah-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.  When you're at sea-sk for a long time-sk-a-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.  And there's nothing but semen on the boats-sk.  I mean, like semen.  I gotcha.  Uh, sometimes you need-sk-a-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.  Ah-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka.  Whale's blowhole.  A lot like a puski.  Really?  Well, if you ain't seen one in Monsk. 
[00:17:00]  Any types of whale.  A hump whale.  A spime whale.  It's kind of hard for Popskai, though.  Why?  Well, I'm used to Olivesk.  She's like a little Gutski.  Little skinny Olivesk.  Gotta get what you can out there and see.  I'll figure that out.  Okay. 
[00:17:30]  So you get so desperate, you jump on whale's backs?  Well, it starts with other sea livesk.  Yeah?  Yeah, like a sea hinchkin.  You ever touch one of those and they all fold up?  Better than Olivesk.  Then you go for the bearded clamsk.  It takes clamsk.  It takes your knife.  And you start shuckin'.  Oh, I shucked it and shucked it and shucked it. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, I'm quite the mother shucka.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  You just keep shuckin'  till you got a juicy, clammy mask in your handsk.  Ah, gah, gah, gah.  Then you use that.  I was shuckin'.  I was shuckin' everything that moved.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  You just keep shuckin'. 
[00:18:30]  When that didn't work, it clamped shut on Pop Sky's member.  Yeah.  My mighty member.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  So, Popeye, have you, um...  I've done a whale.  You've done a whale, huh?  Yeah.  I was out to seask.  Yeah.  Monsk has gone by.  Okay.  I didn't have pusky in Monsk.  I didn't want to do the whalesk.  No.  You've got to grab a cute one, though.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Nothing worse than doing an ugly whale.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  But nothing's better than a huge, livekin, breathekin, man's go.  Once you go whalesk, you never go batsk.  A lot different than Olivesk.  Olivesk is a skin-ski bitch.  With no titskies. 
[00:19:30]  Now, why wouldn't you do, like, the sea hag before the whale?  Whoa!  Not the sea hag!  Oh, that old cave.  I'd rather have blowhole than a sea hag.  You ever see the haggy?  Smells like a chum.  You know when you throw chum bolts? 
[00:20:00]  That's the sea hag!  Hey, Popeye, what are you...  Wimpski wouldn't do her for free burgers.  Wimpski can fit into a shrimpsk!  You've never done sea-livesk?  No, I can't say I have.  There we were. 
[00:20:30]  Tentacles to testicles.  Me and the octopus-ki!  Do you get crabs from, uh...  From the sea life?  I had a crab once!  Yeah?  Oh, tight.  You've got to watch the claws on your chest-wickles.  I'm Popeye the sailor, man. 
[00:21:00]  I'm Popeye the sailor, man.  When there's nothing to nail, you should grab you a whale.  Says Popeye the sailor.  Opie and answer me.  1027 WNEW.  Today, I'd like to talk to you on a very serious note. 
[00:21:30]  Because this is the story of a man overcoming monumental physical pain and suffering.  I went to the DMV today, and it was really, really ugly.  There's nothing funny about what you're about to hear.  Everything was organized.  I went in there.  That's such a part of just being like a man.  I was going to motor vehicle.  Work with me, son.  So I get to the lady, and I must say, the nicest DMV lady ever.  Ever.  She wasn't the problem this time. 
[00:22:00]  The last three times, they were the problem.  All right, so she's going through all the forms like,  Okay, we'll get you out of here in a jiffy.  Right?  And she's going through all the stuff, and I'm like,  All right, finally.  Fourth time going to DMV to get my vehicle registered.  This is it.  I'm finally going to have New York plates.  Let's be told, today's world can be nandy-pandy.  All of a sudden, she says, Okay, I just need a copy of the title.  Is this the title?  I started to panic.  What to do?  What to do? 
[00:22:30]  So I had to get the leasing company on the line.  This was the last time I went to send me the power of attorney,  basically saying it's okay to register the car in New York State.  All right?  Uh-huh.  You would think the people, when they're sending that,  would send a copy of the title, knowing I'm going to need that as well, Anthony.  No, you can't expect them to do that.  So I don't have the title.  So now I can't do it.  So now I'm ready to go home,  which means I'd have to go back to the DMV for the fifth time.  No, no, no!  So then the lady sees the panic on my face.  She goes, Look, can you get the leasing company to fax it over, the title? 
[00:23:00]  If I get a fax of it, boom, you're out of here in two minutes.  I'm like, No problem.  He realizes he's got to get it.  So I go out in the hall.  It's key to the story that you know I only had 70 cents in my pocket.  I call the leasing company, and I explain my situation.  I need the title faxed over to the DMV.  The lady says, I can't do that for you.  You have to talk to Judy.  Judy is busy with another customer.  You'll have to call her back.  Click, hangs up on me. 
[00:23:30]  No, no, no!  I don't have enough money to call damn Judy.  So what do I do?  I drive all the way home.  He figures?  What the heck?  And I call Judy, and I give her a piece of my mind.  I say, Judy, listen, you have to fax a copy of the title to DMV right now.  Will there be a problem?  She says, Oh, no problem at all.  Will you do it now?  She goes, Yes.  I go, Okay.  I am going to leave my house for the DMV.  I expect that title to be faxed when I get there.  That is beautiful.  All right, it gets better. 
[00:24:00]  So I go back to the DMV.  Hey, everyone knows now because I was there an hour before or whatever, okay?  I spend 20 minutes staring at the fax machine waiting for a copy of the title to come through.  What to do?  What to do?  20 minutes later, it's not coming through the fax machine, okay?  He said it would not work.  After 20 minutes away in the DMV, I'm like, Okay, there's a problem.  Now I have to make another call.  I don't have any change.  No, no, no!  So I'm at the customer service.  I explain, Look, the lady was supposed to fax it 20 minutes ago. 
[00:24:30]  I've been staring at the fax machine.  There's a problem.  I need to use your phone.  She goes, There's a phone in the lobby there or whatever, right?  I said, No, I have one nickel.  I can't make a call.  The lady, supposedly part of customer service, goes, You'll have to talk to a supervisor.  His arm arose.  I go, It's a goddamn phone call.  Give me your phone.  Sir, you're building bridges.  You're making friends.  Now the real friendly teller heard me screaming at the lady, and she goes,  And she goes, Here.  And she hands me a cordless phone.  I go, Thank you.  And then I turn to the customer service lady. 
[00:25:00]  I go, Was that hard to do?  He got up and got one.  So I call the leasing company again.  I go, Hi.  Remember you said you would fax it in 20 minutes?  I've been staring at the fax machine.  Guess what?  Nothing is popping out.  What's the problem?  Oh, I'll fax it right over.  I made a copy of it.  It was too light, blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, Will you fax it right now before I come back in here with an automatic weapon  and shoot everybody?  And did she?  She did.  She did? 
[00:25:30]  Fifteen minutes later, she sends it over.  You've got moxie.  And don't let anyone ever take that away from you.  And then I paid my $72.50.  So I wrote the check and I got out of there.  Young man, do you ever look back and wonder what would have happened if you'd just given  up?  If you hadn't followed your dreams?  I took five trips to DMV to get my license and my registration.  And I think we've all learned a lesson from this.  You've showed us that while no man is an island, one man can make a difference.  And now I'm registered in New York?  Pretty cool. 
[00:26:00]  I'd say you are very cool.  A very cool cat indeed.  Hello?  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  102.7 WNEW.  A lot of people want to know if Corky Steinbrenner will be making an appearance today to congratulate  Coney on his perfect game. 
[00:26:30]  Wait, I hear it.  Oh, there you are.  What's up?  It's Corky Steinbrenner, everyone.  Not the strong boss from 1970s.  All of a sudden, I'm a little wrinkled old man that's so sensitive.  I cry every two seconds.  Now, Corky Steinbrenner, I see you have your Crazy Eddie outfit on.  Same outfit you've been wearing since 1977. 
[00:27:00]  That's how I dress.  I wear my turtleneck and my little sports jacket.  You were wearing that same outfit yesterday, even though it was 100 degrees.  You must have been sweating your ballies off.  I was wearing this with my friend.  Billy Martin.  No, Billy.  Where are you, Billy?  Billy, I miss you, Billy, so much.  Corky Steinbrenner.  Corky Steinbrenner. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, JFK Jr.  We hardly knew ye.  Well, was it nice to have Yogi Berra?  Yogi, Yogi.  Yogi Berra Day.  Who can ask for more from a day of baseball?  You never thought you'd see the day of that, Yogi?  Yogi's in the park again, it's a year!  Wait, what was that? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, Yogi in the park again.  Oh, it was so good.  He looks like Yoda, though.  Yoda, Yogi, what's the difference?  So you must be proud of Cody pitching the perfect game yesterday.  Perfect game!  He's the best pitcher in baseball!  He sure is.  And he had Don Larson there.  Don Larson!  What a man! 
[00:28:30]  Let's not forget his perfect game from 1956.  1956!  Did you see the picture of me in the paper with, with, with, Daryl!  Yes, Daryl!  He's the best crackhead in baseball!  We're going to give him another crack at it!  In August, huh? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  If we could keep him away from the horse!  He loves those horse!  One crack or another!  He's trying to get his nose in it!  Well, let's not forget about Mattingly.  Mattingly!  Back in the stadium yesterday.  Mattingly!  He's such a good play!  Brian, he's on the back! 
[00:29:30]  He's done better in the stadium!  I used to be so strong in the 70s.  I never shed a tear.  Remember me yelling at Reggie all the time?  Sure do.  Reggie, Reggie, Reggie, I miss you so much.  Look at me now, I'm a blubbering fool.  I used to be able to fire people up to write. 
[00:30:00]  I didn't care.  I didn't care.  Do you remember what you said in the locker room after you guys won the World Series last year?  I don't know, I was crying.  I said, the Yankees are the best team in baseball.  Oh, it's Dave Winfield.  I love it.  Sure you do.  All right, Corky. 
[00:30:30]  I'm the boss.  I can't believe how lucky I could forget you.  Do you have any thoughts on a huge Yankee fan that passed this weekend, JFK Jr.?  JFK Jr.?  Why did he have to fly?  Why?  He went just like Sermon did.  And Randy Rhoads. 
[00:31:00]  And Randy Rhoads.  My favorite guitar plays.  Why?  Leave the fly into professionals.  You don't see me flying, do you?  Still can forget Stevie Ray in the helicopter.  And Jim Croce.  Yeah.  Leonard Skinner.  Why?  Don't forget Buddy Holly.  Buddy Holly. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, Giuliani, I need a new stadium, please.  Can I have a new stadium, please, man?  Man, you need a Kleenex.  All right, Corky.  Well, Corky, thanks for stopping by the show today.  I used to be so strong, but I look like a woman.  Thanks for letting me on your show, guys.  You are by far the two biggest danceholes in radio. 
[00:32:00]  Corky Steinbrenner, everyone.  How many of these are going to speak?  Float like a cinder block and sting like foam rubber.  I want another fight with Smolder and Joe Frazier. 
[00:32:30]  The thriller and vanilla and chocolate.  I did too many of those decon foregone commercials.  All right, Mohammed, set off the decon foregone in the room, the bomb for the bugs.  Remember when he was doing those commercials?  Oh, decon foregone.  Knocks them down.  Knocks off the balls.  I know, you didn't get it right.  Set off another one.  Decon foregone.  Bugs be running out.  Oh, Mohammed, we didn't have the light right.  Okay.  Set off another.  Decon foregone.  That's probably what did it. 
[00:33:00]  Insecticide.  I would knock out by DDT.  I would get like a boat.  Float like JFK Jr.  And sting like a marshmallow.  That's quality stuff.  I am the greatest.  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony, you're not a jackass.  You're obviously a stride.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:33:30]  It makes me sassy.  1027 WNEW.  This is FM Talk, the 1027 Talk you can't ignore.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, you want in on our stupid radio show?  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  It's filled with a bunch of nonsense, this radio show.  Of course.  Well, we like it.  Nonsense is good.  I hope you do, too.  Our first female, Amy.  Hello.  We like putting the women right on the radio.  Okay.  Well, good to know. 
[00:34:00]  No waiting.  Yeah, no waiting for the ladies, because most of you guys are scared of us.  No.  All right, Amy.  What do you have for the show today?  This is bad.  I was in high school, and I was a freshman, and, you know, working on being popular.  You know, all the games you play in high school, and I come home one day, and my mom's like,  oh, listen, this is really sad.  I ran into Mrs. So-and-so at the supermarket, and, you know, her son doesn't have a date to  the senior prom, so I just told him.  I told her to just tell him to have you go with them, and it would be great. 
[00:34:30]  You know, he's a really nice guy.  He's like the dorkiest guy in the entire night school.  I'm like, mom, you can't do this.  And your mom got you on your prom date.  I'm like, you can't do this, mom.  I'm a freshman.  I don't even want to go to the senior prom.  I can't do this.  You know, like, this could ruin my social career.  She's like, no, you got to do this.  This is awful.  My mom used to try to set me up with the bank tellers at her bank.  Oh, that's cute.  That is nice.  And your mom's trying to say.  You know what's weird about moms?  What they think is cute and what you think is cute is two different things. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there's this lovely, cute little girl at the bank, and I think you guys would be perfect  together, so you finally go in with her, you know?  Because she can make small talk with your mom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She can make small talk with my mom, so I should be dating her.  Yeah.  It's like, Mom, I'm looking for something more in a hose bag at this time of my life.  My mom is just known for that.  She worked all the time, so she was, like, you know, always doing, trying to do extra  things to, like, help you out socially. 
[00:35:30]  She packed my sister's lunch, and my sister comes home crying from school.  She was sent home.  She went to Catholic school.  My mom had packed her lunch, and you know how you would wrap up sodas in tinfoil?  Yeah.  She wrapped up a can of beer by accident.  My sister got sent home from school.  Rock.  That's a cool mom.  Like peanut butter and jelly and bud.  I never had the cool lunch.  Yeah.  I was always the guy trying to upgrade my lunch with my pals. 
[00:36:00]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I never wanted to do that, because I was skeeved out by anyone else's, like, mom's hands touching  the food.  Wow.  That was, you know, do you want to trade this sandwich?  I'm like, ah, your skeevy mom's hands all over this thing?  Get out of here.  I'd get, like, you know, a bruised apple for a snack, and my buds would have, like, homemade  chocolate chip cookies or homemade brownies.  I'm like, come on, man.  Trade.  And I never, I know the horror you went through with the school lunch, but especially with  the bag.  I never wanted the brown bag.  I never wanted the little brown bag. 
[00:36:30]  I wanted a lunch box.  And every year, damn it, I got a lunch box.  I had my Lost in Space lunch box.  You know, one of my brothers should call up with the thermos, but I remember it.  Because you're hitting a real soft spot in my family.  You should just hear what Opie had to go to school with for his lunch.  The bags.  We were so poor.  Get your poor, Opie.  We were so poor.  I'll tell you the story. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, like Anthony said, everyone has.  Look how embarrassing this is.  It's the Big King Colbert.  I'll tell the story, you ass.  I'll tell the Big King Colbert.  If my brother calls, it.  That's great.  How embarrassing.  He would be suicidal to tell the story on the air.  But basically, like Anne said, you know, all your friends had the cool lunch boxes.  Maybe like, I don't know, the Brady Bunch lunch box or the Scooby-Doo lunch box.  Yeah.  Open it up.  You got your little thermos in there for your little fruit cup or something. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  And your drink and your sandwich all nice and wrapped.  Sure.  And then if you didn't have the lunch box or you didn't want one, you could go to the  store and buy the little lunch bag.  No, no.  I'll explain.  The lunch box were, you know, were given to the kids whose mom's really cared.  Right.  Then you had the kids that came in, like you said, with the small brown lunch bag.  You could go to the store and buy a big stack of those.  Right.  Oh, no, it cost too much money to get the small brown paper bags for my lunch. 
[00:38:00]  See, we were so poor.  Like Rick, Rick guessed about two minutes ago.  My goddamn lunch, a lousy peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a bruised apple were, that's  it?  It was just like two little things.  We're in a huge, huge wall-bounds paper bag, the one they pack the groceries in.  And then what was your carrying style? 
[00:38:30]  Would you carry the whole thing or roll it so it's just like the big bottom of the bag  and this huge rolled up?  Man, it gets worse.  It gets worse.  We brought the bags home, home after once.  You had to fold them up and bring them home.  Oh, that's pretty bad, man.  So we could put the book covers on our textbooks. 
[00:39:00]  You made them out of the paper bags.  Yeah, so like my science textbook had a big, huge wall-bounds on the front.  All my friends had the cool Star Trek book covers.  So they were dual-purpose, Anthony.  They were used to carry my lousy sandwich and bruised apple to school, and then we had  to bring them home so we could make book covers.  It's going to have your name written on it, too. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, fakes.  Because then when you leave that with your coat over, you know, you have your whole thing  set up, everybody knows it's your bag if your name's on it.  Oh, the big shopping bag.  I knew my brother would call.  He's a bitter man.  Elmo.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Is this a nightmare or what?  Why are you bringing this up?  You know, it gets dark at 4 o'clock.  I'm already suicidal, and you have to bring that up. 
[00:40:00]  I mean, we would take these huge, like, King Colin bags and roll the top down and fold them  and do whatever we could to try to mimic those smaller bags.  We looked normal.  But once, I also got a cement bag from Dad.  Wait a minute.  One of those huge cement bags.  We, you know, we were done doing the sidewalks around the house.  Like a Sacrete bag or something?  Yeah, one of those huge bags.  You know, because my dad...  Still, like, powder in it?  So we put the food in that and rolled it up. 
[00:40:30]  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  A cement bag.  It was unbelievable.  Trust me.  My brother says it.  It happened.  It happened.  I'm dying for you.  A cement bag.  This is like the shame of our family.  I still can't go shopping and get paper.  I always have to go plastic just to erase the memory.  Elmo, you notice how, like, Dad's telling all his horror stories from growing up,  and I'm keeping my mouth shut?  I know.  I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:41:00]  That's like going to a spa.  I'm like, I'm just biting my lip because I don't want to have a nervous breakdown live on the air.  Oh, come on.  I'd love it.  It'll make you feel better.  Tell, Anthony, about the sugar and margarine sandwiches at Grandma's house.  Oh, delicacy.  What are they feeding the kids?  I'm diabetic now.  I wonder what.  Oh, my God.  He is, too.  What did they do?  Well, my grandma had a beach house out there in Waiting River. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, that sounds pretty fancy.  That's it.  It was a nice.  It was great.  It was a great little house.  Great.  And, I don't know, she had about, what, 40 grandkids' elves?  At least.  So, she would just break out, you know, a loaf of Wonder Bread, just on the table, quick  margarine, all the way down.  She'd bake, like, 20 sandwiches at a time, and then just pour sugar on the butter.  And give it to kids.  And give it to us. 
[00:42:00]  And give it to kids.  Yeah.  Like they weren't wired enough.  And then we'd bounce around.  Bing, bing, bing.  And then we'd go outside to get fried by the sun, because we didn't wear sunscreen.  Wait, they wouldn't put sunscreen on you?  Oh, tell the whole story, man.  Come on.  Kids don't crank, getting burnt.  All right, number one, we'd go swimming in the ocean without any kind of supervision,  when we're like three.  We'd have no suntan motion.  We'd be eating sugar.  I mean, it was just really paradise.  And then we would be so burnt from the sun that we couldn't move, right? 
[00:42:30]  Right.  And what did we have to sleep in at night?  The army blankets with the sand.  It was like reclining on sandpaper.  Those old, like, army blankets, the real rough ones?  Yeah, those dark green blankets.  And we used to make tents out of them.  And we're talking, we were so sunburned, like, our eyelids were red, and, like, our underarms were red.  Right?  And we'd have to sleep on top of sand.  And then we'd have to sleep in these army cots with an army blanket. 
[00:43:00]  We might as well have been sleeping, you know, on insulation.  Because it was the same feeling between the army blanket and the sand that happened to be there from the last person that slept in the army cot.  And if it wasn't sand, then it was full of sugar, which has the same effect.  Oh, my God.  That's some upbringing.  It was great, yeah.  It was great.  All I wanted was, like, the lousy little brown lunch bag. 
[00:43:30]  Bag.  Little sandwich.  I know.  I practically have to, like, stick people up.  Not for the lunch money, but for their lunch bag.  Like, give me the bag.  The last thing you wanted to do going to school was look different.  I swear to God, you just wanted a conformed fit in so no one would give you crap.  Because the second you try to do something different, you're marked an outcast.  Oh, sweet.  And if you're the big lunch bag guy, people are calling you the big lunch bag guy. 
[00:44:00]  The cement lunch bag guy is even worse.  That's the truth.  But in the winter, like, I wouldn't wear my jacket because I'd use it to camouflage the huge lunch bag.  But now I go home with a cold.  It's just a nightmare.  It was interesting.  All I wanted was a sandwich.  Remember the kid in school in the cafeteria that might as well have been the drug dealer?  He came in with the little plastic baggie of chocolate for the chocolate milk.  It was like this powder stuff, and everyone would gather around, man, put a little in my milk, man. 
[00:44:30]  Put a little in.  Well, what you got, man?  What do you have for me?  I'm the chocolate man.  Here we go, kids.  I got chocolate.  And, like, his buddies would all, you know, just I keep a little for my head, and then I get rid of the rest.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The chocolate milk kid, like, rule.  I never got the chocolate milk.  You're kidding me.  I remember that.  And he would, like, dole it out to his buddies so that the milk just, it was still like the color of milk, just vaguely brown. 
[00:45:00]  Like, yeah, we're drinking chocolate milk, and you suck.  Wow, I do suck.  I try to trade the bruised apple or the bruised pear for that, but it's never worked for some reason.  Why were fruit was a very low commodity on the ladder?  Elms, when we were growing up, why were our apples so damn bruised?  Because they had so much room to bounce around in a bus bed.  All right, I'm going to go and slip my wrist now. 
[00:45:30]  Train and ring.  What's that, a train?  O.P. and Anthony, 1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Fax line, 212-957-963.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Oh, dude, man, God damn. 
[00:46:00]  Hope I didn't get any on you.  Look at the dust that came off the board, too.  Why do you think I'm sneezing?  Yeah, but do they ever dust this thing?  Who's got to use that mic?  Jeez.  You've got, like, the cancer victim mic over there.  What?  I don't know what the freaking morning guy has,  but you talk it to the same mic he does every day.  The chick sprays it, though.  Yeah.  After her show.  Fax line, 212-957-9639.  And we got some Alan Greenspan audio. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God, it's hilarious.  He's funny.  He's like the Wizard of Oz, this guy.  Alan Greenspan, of course, the most important person in America.  Yeah.  Kids, don't be fooled.  Don't think, like, the President of the United States  is the most important man in America.  I don't even think he's in the top ten anymore.  He's just a figurehead.  He is totally a figurehead, like the, not even the Queen of England,  like the King of England.  Just useless.  Alan Greenspan, when he talks, the economy works or doesn't work. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  The market goes up or down.  Right.  If you know anything about Alan Greenspan, I mean, everyone on Wall Street,  they listen to what he says.  He's in charge of interest rates and things like that, you know.  And then the whole economy shifts just because of what he says.  It's a delicate balance.  He's like the guy who's spinning plates on sticks.  And sometimes you've got to, like, you know, leave one stick alone for a while  and spin the ones on the other stick.  And then you're like, oh, no, the sticks on my feet are slowing down. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  All right.  I won't pay as much attention to the sticks on my shoulder,  and I'll spin these plates on my foot.  So it's a delicate balancing act of raising and lowering interest rates  and determining inflation and unemployment and all kinds.  It's a big stew of financial crap that he stirs around.  Can I tell you something?  That magic trick with the plates and stuff always stresses me out  when I have to watch it at home.  Oh, look.  It's slowing down on his foot.  Oh, my God.  Will it get there in time?  It freaks me out. 
[00:48:00]  I saw a guy set a record of spinning basketballs on his body.  And he had, like, the things on his kneecaps and his feet and his fingers  and his head, his nose, a chin, everywhere.  And he's spinning.  He starts the first one, and he's got, like, all right, he's got 35 to go.  And I'm looking at that first one going, oh, geez, it's wobbling.  Oh, it's wobbling.  It's got to fall off.  Like we need more stress in our life.  We can't just, you know, enjoy.  I know.  I feel stressed out.  You're absolutely right.  The spinning plate guy.  He's spinning plates. 
[00:48:30]  We can't enjoy it.  He used to watch, like, Merv.  Hey, it's the spinning plate guy on Merv.  This is great entertainment.  But Alan Greenspan is like that.  Yeah.  So he talks, and he never says anything that anyone can really understand.  It's hard to decipher what Alan Greenspan says.  Thank God.  It's kind of like World War II where we're trying to decipher the code.  Yeah.  I have the Enigma code.  Right.  It's like some kind of a code that he talks in that we can't quite understand, but the 
[00:49:00]  people that run things, I think, understand.  And he talks, and the market reacts.  You know, I think we, as a country, should keep this guy very, very happy.  Just send him hookers every day.  Whatever he takes.  Hookers for Alan Greenspan.  He should have been getting hummers in the Oval Office.  Is he married?  Does anyone know he is married?  Could you imagine if he has a bad morning with his wife?  He could wreck the entire world economy.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine that?  Alan!  Right.  What are you doing with your underwear on the floor? 
[00:49:30]  Shut up, you bitch.  I'm going to raise interest rates a full part.  Market will plummet, you sons of bitches.  Can't stand this.  So we got audio of Alan Greenspan.  Try to figure out what he's saying.  The whole economy is influenced by what he is saying today, okay?  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Our challenge in monetary policy is to foster, as best we can,  the financial conditions that will allow this economic expansion 
[00:50:00]  and technological revolution to continue as long and as vigorously as possible.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, Alan, we're listening.  What are you saying?  We're going to what?  What should I do then?  You know what he's like?  You ever watch those shows where there's like this all-knowing, all-powerful being,  and the poor little human guy or the poor just regular guy asks him, 
[00:50:30]  what do I do?  Or when should I fire at the monster?  What should I do?  And they go, you'll know when the time comes.  And you go, oh, no.  Could you just tell me when the time is right, you will know.  Like, help me out, will you?  Like, oh, could you just give me a time, a roundabout ballpark?  Throw me a bone, will you, Mr. All-Knowing Guy?  All right, so Alan Greenspan spoke.  We have another clip.  Try to decipher what he's saying here. 
[00:51:00]  Experience has demonstrated that an essential ingredient in this prosperity  and an ingredient for which the central bank has ultimate responsibility over the long run  is low and stable inflation.  What?  You will know more when the sun and moon are one.  Right.  When the cows wag their tails and the dogs sleep with the cats.  What?  Every word was perfectly picked. 
[00:51:30]  You notice that?  Yeah, every word.  Carefully.  He has to because if he says the wrong thing or if it's even interpreted as the wrong thing,  the economy will suffer.  All right, let's listen to the last Alan Greenspan quote from today.  See if you can figure it out.  Effective price stability removes a major source of uncertainty and distortion  that would otherwise interfere with the spending and savings decisions of households and businesses.  Maintaining price stability also reduces the likelihood that imbalances could develop 
[00:52:00]  that would ultimately undermine economic expansion.  What?  Holy mother of pearl.  I feel like I'm in advanced trigonometry again and the professor's doing the problem  on the board like, okay, you start and you're like, okay, I follow that.  By the end, you're like freaking out like, oh, I lost you somewhere.  Oh, no.  I don't understand a word he's saying.  You're just sitting there.  I remember that with the teacher.  And then you just would heat up inside and get all, like, hot. 
[00:52:30]  Like, oh, no.  I had him.  I had him the first few words and I lost him somewhere and I haven't gotten him back.  I'm going to fail.  I'm going to fail.  I haven't understood a word he said in 10 minutes.  He's right and I ain't catching this.  But you start concentrating.  It's like, okay, I got it.  You get the first few, maybe the first line of the problem.  You know, 20 lines into the problem.  You're just, like, sweating and you're heating up and you're just like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Alan, should I buy or sell?  What should I do right now? 
[00:53:00]  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, you're next on WNAW.  Hey, what's up, guys?  This guy's reminding me of the Darth Vader bits you guys used to do.  Oh, our old boss.  Yeah, he's like the Darth Vader of the economy or something.  Hey, boss, when are we going to do an appearance next?  Could you, like, tell us when our next appearance is?  I am Darth Vader.  The appearances will come when the time is right. 
[00:53:30]  We must first move the Death Star into proper position.  Then the appearance will be based on the military might of the planet we are surrounding.  But Darth Vader, we just want to, like, go out with Budweiser and have some party with our friends.  Darth Vader?  Yes.  Are you going to be raising interest rates in the near future?  That will be determined at a later date. 
[00:54:00]  Based upon, well, which way I tie my shoelaces.  Yes, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  I am the master.  I don't know.  Maybe I'll raise interest rates.  Let me flip this coin.  Darth Vader.  Yeah, Greenspan is like him.  Vinny.  Hello.  Vinny actually knows what Alan Greenspan is trying to say today.  All right.  Go ahead, Vinny. 
[00:54:30]  You know, it's real simple.  This guy's like a retard, first of all.  He's like 90 years old.  Last time he would talk, the gas was 80 cents a gallon.  All he talked about was what he talked about, prices being important.  Yeah.  Well, that's all he's talking about is inflation.  That if prices don't rise, the economy stays the way it is.  Vinny's the brainy kid in the front row.  We don't like you, Vinny.  You're with the AV squad, aren't you?  You know where to put the paper clip when the film starts jumping.  I never knew.  Where did the AV kid used to put the eraser on the pencil when the film went... 
[00:55:00]  And he made it straight and right out, and I was jealous of that,  because I never knew where to put it.  Obi-Anthony.  Obi-Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  I'll do this one for all the animal lovers, since they like gerbils so much.  Uh-oh.  It's a sing-along, too, so everybody feel free to join in.  Follow the bumps and bulls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you kill a kitten. 
[00:55:30]  Mark my words, because from where I'm sitting, you can't go wrong if you kill a kitten.  Look at those bumps. 
[00:56:00]  There's no crime that you'll be committing.  I know the law, you can...  Everybody!  Kill a kitten.  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting, you'll get plenty when you kill a kitten.  Feed it turpentine, or break its spine. 
[00:56:30]  Crush it with your shoe, as long as you kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Listen up.  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten, she'll like you better when you kill a kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, because that's where it's written. 
[00:57:00]  If he loveth Jesus, he must kill a kitten.  Throw him at a train.  Make him snort cocaine.  Drown him in a lake.  Bake a kitty cake.  Flush him down the can. 
[00:57:30]  Hit him with your van.  Stick some tea and tea up his cup of tea.  Do what you must do, as long as you kill a kitten.  Kill a kitten.  Meow.  Kill a kitten.  She's got to kill a kitten.  I'll do it.  All right.  All right. 
[00:58:00]  Killing kittens isn't easy.  And if the thought makes you feel queasy, grab a pitchfork from the shed.  Ain't kill a puffy dog instead.  Kill a kitten.  You've got to kill a kitten.  A little furry kitten. 
[00:58:30]  You've got to kill a kitten.  You've got to kill a mother.  You've got to kill a son.  Kill a little f***ing daddy.  Kill a man.  To 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  To 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  Meow.  Meow.  Steven Lynch, everyone.  Thanks.  Static. 
[00:59:00]  Opie and Anthony, 2-7.  Then, more static.  1-0-2-7.  W-O-N-A.  I'm hearing there's a guy on the line that got very injured.  Oh.  The gay pride parade.  I was very injured at the gay pride parade.  Yesterday, huh?  Oh.  So what happened to you?  Well, I went down there because it was for gay pride.  Yeah.  But I thought it was, gay was happy. 
[00:59:30]  Like, in the Flintstones song, we'll have a gay old time.  So you thought just, uh, it would be very festive.  People would be just having a happy time.  Oh, I was wrong.  Yeah?  Boy, the weather yesterday, it was the Triple H's.  What do you mean the Triple H's?  Hazy, hot, and homo.  Oh.  I didn't know.  Oh.  I wanted to march in the parade.  Yeah.  So I just joined in.  Uh-huh.  And a young man said, march in front of me. 
[01:00:00]  I'll bring up your rear.  And, oh, he did.  Oh.  And I started chanting with the rest of them.  Because I didn't know.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're...  That didn't go over too well?  No.  Then I went on one of the rides they had set up.  What do you mean they had rides at the Gay Pride Parade?  Richard Gere's Tunnel of Terror. 
[01:00:30]  Oh.  It's like a slide, but you dress up like a gerbil.  Oh, jeez.  And slide in.  And I was banged about on some faux intestines.  Oh.  Oh.  And I had just gotten back from England.  Yeah.  So I got used to calling cigarettes fags.  Okay.  So I was going around going, hey, give me a fag.  I need a fag in my mouth now. 
[01:01:00]  I said, look, I'm dying for a nice big fag to suck on.  And all of a sudden this grown man puts his stuff in my face.  Oh.  Oh.  Well.  I could imagine my shock.  Yeah, how was it?  I'm suing for that.  So I ducked out into a bar.  All the stools were upside down.  That old gag.  But I did find some lovely ladies in there.  Oh, ladies?  Finally.  Ladies at the Gay Pride Parade, huh? 
[01:01:30]  Well, I'm quite the stud.  I was making time with them.  Uh-huh.  And making out at the bar.  Oh, yeah.  This poor girl, though, she had something in her throat.  Why?  That she couldn't swallow because it was making a lump in front.  Ah!  I was going at it.  That was a dude.  Oh.  Because then I saw something twitching in her dress.  So I picked up a bottle and hit it.  And she punched me.  I thought it was a rat.  Then some man asked if he could push in my stool for me. 
[01:02:00]  That old gag.  So I ran out of there and caught the parade, more of the parade.  Yeah.  I saw the baton twirlers.  Yeah.  They were spinning the batons.  But you should see how they catch these things.  How do they catch them?  Well, put it this way.  They could do a handstand and catch it.  Because that's what they weren't doing.  Oh.  All I know is I maybe had too much to drink. 
[01:02:30]  And I woke up dressed as the Indian from the village people.  With my ass burning.  In a place called the Piledriver.  Oh.  So I'm shooing all involved.  I'm very injured.  All right.  I can't sit down.  God damn it.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that you got injured at the Gay Pride Parade.  No.  Are you done?  I'm done.  All right.  No.  There goes the guy that got injured at the Gay Pride Parade.  And then I'll be back. 
[01:03:00]  This is debauchery mania.  I did that.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I did that.  101-027-WNEW.  Good afternoon.  Hi.  I'm going to be in the Nevada area.  Uh-huh.  In about a week.  Uh-huh.  I got your pleasure menu.  Peen-in, peen-in.  Oh.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome.  Mm-hmm.  Which, uh, makes it hard to, uh, communicate.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.  Oh, no problem.  Okay.  Any prices, hun?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  A hundred.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Wow.  That's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit, because all the ladies are independent contractors.  Uh, you don't think the girls would mind being with a da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da- 
[01:04:00]  Could I do that? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy,  I can get a little wild, you know, when I get...  Is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Do you take the fees?  A mess card?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't? 
[01:05:00]  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind when I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  It's your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any girls that aren't that attractive?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever? 
[01:05:30]  Do you have any...  Black girls?  We have black ladies.  We have Asian ladies.  We have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy.  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  Um, no, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay? 
[01:06:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Opie and Anthony.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I used to like one for a while.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  It is Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  All right, Ant. 
[01:06:30]  You want to get into this rape thing?  What?  What do you mean?  Uh-oh, they found out.  There's this biologist, Dr. Thornhill.  And he says that rape is in every guy.  Yeah, like it's just a fact of our biology.  We are biologically inclined to rape.  To rape.  Oh.  The hell is this guy?  I want to hear what his logic is.  All right, listen to this.  Yes, indeed.  Rape is natural, biological, and evolved. 
[01:07:00]  That is, there's no question but that rape is biological.  All right.  I guess the common thought behind rape is that it's not a crime of passion or sex.  It's just a violent act.  And people said that the rapist, it has nothing to do with sex.  It's all about power and violence.  But this guy is saying that it is just a sexual thing.  And it goes back to like caveman times.  Caveman days.  Where we just forced ourselves upon the cave woman. 
[01:07:30]  You ever see that clan of the cave bear?  Who was in that?  Daryl Hannah?  Yeah.  Remember that?  The guy just like, she's down by the lake getting some water bent over.  And the guy just comes up behind her.  Wham!  Slams it home.  Oh, man.  We're going to get into some heavy stuff.  Mike says the rape comment is true.  And he'll tell us why.  All right.  Mike, what's your logic?  Okay.  Actually, I'm a third-year psych major at Hofstra University.  And I'm going to tell you, the ego actually wants to suppress rape only because of the superego we get punished. 
[01:08:00]  But internally, we technically want to rape when we're...  What?  Shrink talk.  Okay.  I mean, it's boring, but it's absolutely true.  We are born with the intention to rape.  The only reason we don't do it is because we feel we're going to be punished for it.  Otherwise, we just go out there banging everything in sight.  It's a fact.  Well, isn't that just anything?  Like, if we would rob and...  Yeah, pretty much anything that you're going to do that you would satisfy yourself, that would satisfy your ego, rather.  Yeah.  That's what you would do unless you would feel threatened about being punished about it.  Basically, we'd go out, we'd rob, we'd rape, we'd steal. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, okay.  We would be doing all of that.  Well, everybody's got that thing about if your plane was going down, what would you do?  Grab the hottest-looking chick next to you and just start going.  Grab a handful of boob and that's it.  Okay.  Mike, what's up?  You know, listen, at some point, all girls, they want to be raped.  They want to feel that.  Not to be raped.  Hold on, Mike.  Hold on.  Explain yourself.  At some point, I mean, they all have it in them that they want that roughness. 
[01:09:00]  Not like they want someone strange.  So, like...  Well, wait, you can't make a blanket statement like that.  Not all girls.  Maybe there's girls that are into the rough sex and maybe want to...  And there's some fantasizing.  And I have heard some girls have the rape fantasy, but to say that all women are into  that is...  Yeah, like they would just want a stranger to come up to them and assault them like that.  She wants to get raped.  What?  Oh, my God.  Let's take a...  There's lots of girls that want to get raped.  Oh, really? 
[01:09:30]  It's the truth.  All right, wait.  They want guys to like...  All right, wait.  The girl with the two nipples is back in the studio.  Now, what's your name?  Trish.  Trish.  And you want in on this discussion?  I think a lot of girls have fantasies that they want to have more spontaneity in the  like sexual end of things.  And they'll have this deviant thing and Satanism type of thing where they want to be like handcuffed  and thrown down and...  Are you speaking from personal preference?  Well, actually, it's something that I constantly think about that I would love to have in there. 
[01:10:00]  You want me to like come over and punch in the face?  Do you want love for this to happen to you?  Yeah.  Well, no, no, I've been...  No, not portraying the thing.  How about you start running down the hall and we'll have Psycho Mark change it?  I would love that.  I would like to chime in on some of this discussion.  Yes, Mike Tyson back in the studio with the megaphone.  Yes.  I agree with this bitch.  I think every woman wants to get raped.  Come here, honey.  You like that, don't you?  Body blow. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah, look.  Look at all the boobs.  I'm doing like a speed bag in the gym.  Yeah.  I want to cross your face.  You like that, don't you?  So you're saying all the chicks, they like them whipped?  I'm not saying all of them, but I'm saying a lot of them fantasize about different things.  Yeah.  I'm not talking to you.  Shut up and bend over.  Okay, baby.  I'm going to give it to you hard.  First, I'm going to...  Here's my foreplay.  Right in the... 
[01:11:00]  I'm going to punch your rectum.  Here we go.  It loosens up the area.  No, don't worry.  I'm used to doing this.  Ask Robin Gibbons.  She loved it.  I would punch her all about the leather Cheerio.  You know what that is, don't you?  Now I'm really pissed because I was in prison for nothing.  She thinks you're saying a girl's like to be raped.  I'm saying that girl's like...  Hey, shut up. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  Goddamn bitches.  They never want to listen.  You got a good jaw seems to be working pretty good.  Take that with you.  It works very good.  Hey, Mike, what do you think of her two nipples on her left breast?  That's pretty good.  I'd like to punch it.  There we go.  Look at her boobs are swelling up.  This is cheaper than a boob job.  Look, you're going from a C to a D.  Look, now you got boob on your chin. 
[01:12:00]  Look at her pussy right in there.  That's good.  Can you bleed out of that nipple?  I'm going to keep punching until you do.  Chicks did this.  I love that.  Yeah?  You like that?  You want it hard, don't you?  Oh, baby, get it to me hard.  I'll bend you over.  I'll treat you like Spinks.  Remember in that fight I had with him?  I would punch in here.  And I wanted to get him in his gappy teeth. 
[01:12:30]  Teeth.  Teeth.  Teeth.  Teeth.  A-F-F.  Teethers.  Hey, you know something?  Mike Tyson can help you.  I am Mike can help you out with that double nipple.  I'll just bite that bitch off.  Come here.  Don't, oh, don't love me.  Don't scream so hard.  The police are going to come.  I don't get along with them very well. 
[01:13:00]  And if it's a bitch cop, I'm going to do the job.  I don't care.  They got a gash.  I'm in.  How am I doing?  You do, Jack.  I'm okay, huh?  Yeah, you do.  Let me poke your hair.  Oh, you're getting like that, don't you?  I love that.  You're not too lubed off.  I think you need a few more body bluers.  Let me see that balloon knot.  You know what a balloon knot is? 
[01:13:30]  No.  You ever blow up a balloon, a party balloon, and you look in the end of it after you tie it up?  You ever do that?  You got a brain in that head, you bitch.  Let me knock you out the skull a little bit.  See if I could jar loose any of those brain cells.  Did you ever blow up a balloon?  Yeah.  You ever blow anything?  Christ.  You're thicker than my head. 
[01:14:00]  You ever look in a balloon knot?  What does it look like?  It looks like my ass.  Very good.  Well, at least you got the right answer.  It does look like that.  Sorry.  Mike Kaiser is going to give you a Cleveland steamer.  You like that?  You ever hear me that one?  It's also called the hot lunch.  It's where you lay on the floor and bombs away with the sticky bombs. 
[01:14:30]  Shut up!  Goddamn, bitches.  Then she's screaming like she doesn't like me sticking my fist in there.  I'm going to hog tie you, you bitch.  Here, can I do a little more foreplay?  I'm going to punch you in your uterus.  There we go.  There we go.  Oh, let me just grab a handful of ovary.  Oh. 
[01:15:00]  That's good.  Mike, you need more, Mike.  Oh, that's okay.  You want more?  Here you go, baby. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, you keep screaming.  Here you go.  Right in the bung.  We're in the prison for nothing.  Courtney, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  I'm a psychologist also.  And I wanted to know that if they were saying from the evolutionary standpoint that, what, that they like to rape?  I don't know nothing about evolution.  I haven't reached that yet. 
[01:16:00]  That's like puberty for me.  I ain't gone through it.  What else also?  Didn't the cavemen also kill each other to eat food?  I mean, come on.  I still do.  You saw that fight where I bite the ear off.  I'm still doing that.  You need to tell that guy to put himself into a jail and have him be raped.  Yeah, by me, Mike Tyson.  Exactly.  Iron Mike loves it.  Iron Mike would give him a good one, too.  I had a couple of boys that were in prison.  I would call queens of the weight room prom. 
[01:16:30]  It was great.  I'd dress them all up.  They would toss my salad.  A lot of controversy on the show today.  Trish saying that a lot of girls want to be raped today.  I'm not talking so happy.  I agree wholeheartedly.  And it's easier to rape them after you.  There's two times.  Shut up.  You came to my hotel when you wanted it. 
[01:17:00]  You looked at me.  You wanted it.  You were running down the street screaming.  You wanted it.  Marcy, what's going on?  Yeah, I just want to know how old Trish is.  28.  And what's your education, dear?  What's my education?  Yeah, do you have an education?  Yeah, I went to college for two years.  Really?  Well, spontaneity is not a word.  Yes, it is.  No, it's not, Mike.  Spontaneity.  Trisha, if you know anybody that has been raped in the past, it was not a real pleasant experience. 
[01:17:30]  It certainly does not turn people on.  And I really think you're a big bimbo.  You ain't going to rape my eye.  I'm not going to shut up.  You ain't going to laugh.  Wait a minute.  Can I tell you something?  I'm not talking technically as far as, like, getting attacked and raped and beat and beaten up.  I'm talking about...  I'm talking about...  All right.  Let me restate it.  I'm talking about a little bit of foreplay where your hair gets pulled.  You get spanked around.  It's not anything that's going to physically hurt the woman, per se. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  Okay.  I apologize.  For us women that listen to O&A, and, you know, I personally enjoy you guys, get out of hand.  I mean, this turns out a bad message.  I agree with our little hair pulling, maybe a little name calling, some gentle biting, and a spade shovel over the head.  Pass the night out with Iron Mike.  Oh, look, the whore hung up.  Marcy hung up.  Well, it's a sick statement by this biologist.  Let's play that again.  Yes, indeed.  Rape is natural, biological, and evolved. 
[01:18:30]  That is, there's no question but that rape is biological.  All right.  I'm going out tonight.  Look, look at that.  I'm working out on the heavy bag, only it's your prostate.  Patty, what's going on?  I just wanted to say that as far as, like, women, you know, fantasizing about being raped and everything.  Yes.  As far as myself, you know, if I'm with somebody I trust, it's one thing, but I don't know about women fantasizing about getting raped, you know.  But what about if you're with a big boxer ex-convict? 
[01:19:00]  How would you feel then?  Huh?  It's fucking funny how you feel, you bitch.  Bridget.  Yes.  What's up?  What can you add to this?  I just wanted to say that there's a big difference between rape and fantasizing about rough sex.  Not with me.  But the whole true definition of rape is when it's sex against your will.  I don't care what that name is, Will, Bob, Pete. 
[01:19:30]  I don't care.  I'm doing more.  Well, I know you don't care about it, Mike, but the point is I think we need to worry about the line that we're crossing between rape and fantasizing with rough sex.  I mean, it's just...  That's a big difference, obviously.  You know, and I think, you know, I love this show and I listen to it every day on my drive home.  It makes an hour go by fast.  But we need to, you know, just be careful about the line that we're crossing.  That's all.  Thank you, Bridget.  You know how you stop that?  All the screaming? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Disable the jaw.  Most bitches I've punched, I noticed they got a glass jaw.  They can't even take a punch.  It's like it doesn't even have to be a full right hand.  It could just be like a short arm left or something, and they go right down.  Look, like, watch this one.  Look, get back here.  Look, watch.  Down.  It didn't take nothing.  You make a short arm, you'll win. 
[01:20:30]  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  I want minorities.  Not enough minorities on my show.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  It's all white guys.  Gellman, bring me some spear chuckers.  Come on.  You can't say that, Regis. 
[01:21:00]  It says in the paper today, can anybody explain this to me, Regis asked?  Why is it that nearly all our contestants are white men?  I'm a white man, so you know I have nothing against them.  But come on, we would really like a little more diversity here.  Diversity?  Where are the Mau Mau's?  For the love of God, Gellman, get me some spooks.  They've had over 100 contestants so far.  There has not been one African-American playing for the money in the hot seat. 
[01:21:30]  Really?  We've had one Hispanic and just 11 women.  Regis says, here's the challenge.  He said, everyone out there who has thought about being on the show, who isn't a white male, dial that 1-800 number, and let's get into the game.  Come on.  What's the worst thing that could happen to you?  You might become a millionaire.  You have a problem with that?  I don't think so.  Bring on the chinks.  Gellman, Kathy Lee, get me some chinks.  Where are the wetbacks?  They make their way across the border.  Make your way to the hot seat. 
[01:22:00]  You could win a million.  I want homos, Gellman.  Where are the slopes?  Come on.  You can't say that.  I want gooks.  Gooks and spokes, call.  Call Regis.  Oh, my God.  So Regis is looking for some minorities on.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  Is that your final answer, you spade? 
[01:22:30]  I can't believe it, Gellman.  He wants minorities, I guess.  Yes.  I want minorities.  Yes, he does.  Where are the dot heads?  Get out of your 7-Elevens and into the hot seat.  I want hymies, gooks, chinks, spades, spear chuckers.  Bring them all.  Eskimos, homos. 
[01:23:00]  Mexicans, wetbacks.  I don't care.  Get me something other than whiting in the hot seat, Gellman.  Where are the homos?  The lesbos?  The slopes?  I want a dyke, Gellman.  Bring on the kid touches.  Yes.  Yes.  Hey, Vinny.  Hey, fellas, what's up?  What's up, Vinny?  Listen, that's what I'm talking about. 
[01:23:30]  What's going on with this country?  Oh, my God, not Vinny.  Come on.  Hey, let me just say something.  You've got the number one show on TV.  So let's bring some black people on the show to make it better.  That's like saying, hey, I live in a really nice neighborhood.  I got an idea.  Let's get some black folk to make it better.  I mean, come on.  What's going on here?  Oh, Vinny, you're very funny, man.  You know what I'm talking about?  You're wrong, but you're funny.  I tried this once before on that show, Johnny.  That lady, Maya Angelou, was complaining because they didn't have enough black intestines. 
[01:24:00]  They found out that black people were trying to get on the show, but they weren't passing the test.  That was the only problem.  I don't care.  We'll lower the standards.  I need spear chuckers.  Yeah, that's all we need.  It's a number one show.  Let's get some blacks on it.  I don't think it's better.  Why?  Gelman, Gelman, where are my black whores?  I'm putting out a plea.  Jigaboos, Jigaboos, where are you?  Come on.  I need minorities. 
[01:24:30]  We're just looking for minorities for who wants to be a millionaire.  Where are the towel heads?  Get out of your cabs and into the hot seat.  Gelman, I need slopes.  Where are the nips?  You sat your ass in those zeros when you bombed Pearl Harbor.  Sit your ass in the hot seat.  Maybe we should not rename the show, Who Wants Food Stance?  Oh, my God.  Come on, Gelman.  Get me some donkeys. 
[01:25:00]  What?  That's just wrong.  Just why do they have to kiss black ass constantly?  What is the problem?  I'll kiss him.  Just put him in the hot seat.  Regis, why?  Why are you going to do it?  I don't understand.  We got all the whites watching.  We need higher ratings.  I need some colored.  You know, you have a guy at Thanksgiving.  Are you listening to me?  Yeah, I'm here.  At Thanksgiving, you eat breast meat all the time.  Occasionally, you want some dark meat.  That's where Regis stands.  I look at that Kathie Lee white bread all day. 
[01:25:30]  I need black hoes.  Aborigines.  I don't care.  Come on, into the hot seat.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  The darker the better.  You want the minorities on who wants to be a millionaire, right?  Arabs.  Retards.  I don't care.  I want a mongoloid.  Preferably a jiggaboo mongoloid.  All right, listen, Regis.  I got to cut you off because Jay Moore is on the line. 
[01:26:00]  Jay Moore?  Yeah.  Let's check in with Jay Moore.  Jay.  Hey, if you want minorities on the show, put on the half-breed.  He's two minorities.  Put the rock on.  A big fat Samoan with man boobs.  The guy will eat the chair he's sitting on.  Put the rock on.  Come on.  I need the rock.  Who wants food stamps?  Show me your green card.  Ah, he hung up again.  Where did he go?  His phone's crap cut off. 
[01:26:30]  Because he's going through the tunnels down there in D.C.  All right, now, we've got to take a break.  Regis, we've got to take a break.  Jay Moore's in D.C.?  Yeah.  Tell him to come back with some blacks.  They're running around rampant down there.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  Buddy Hacker always goes, people can't laugh when they're breathing in.  I used the C word on stage one time.  He goes, you can't do that. 
[01:27:00]  Because they go, they can't laugh when they're breathing in.  You've got to mix it in so they're already going out.  And then you throw the C word in there.  And they're already going out.  They're on your side.  And then you can say, where's my gun?  Do you mind if I have another shot?  Because I've got to go in the other room.  I learned that a functioning idiot without a high school diploma can get a job on the radio.  Now, Obie and Anthony.  Theater of the Mindless. 
[01:27:30]  1027 WNEW.  1027 Talk, you can't ignore it.  It's Obie and Anthony.  Talking about the Flight 990 stuff.  Now they're saying that it's a possibility that one of the pilots decided to commit suicide.  I kill you.  I kill you.  And bring 216 people with them.  I am garbage.  My tooth, my teeth.  They're killing me.  I'm a scratch plane. 
[01:28:00]  Why?  Why are you doing this to me?  That's just a scary thought.  Yeah, you've got to worry about every other thing that happens.  The weather, mechanical failure, some F up.  And then you've got a co-pilot that wants to cash it in.  Well, that's what they're thinking.  At this point, they can't confirm anything, but that's where they're leading lately.  Putting the information together, that's what the conclusion they're drawing. 
[01:28:30]  They want to hand over the case to the FBI, so that's not good news.  Like, what are you going to do, though?  Arrest the guy?  I mean, geez, it's done.  Nothing you can do at this point.  That's just a scary thought.  I am Tarbash.  I am pissed off.  I am the Egyptian.  First, he said some kind of a prayer about death that they picked up on the tape and  then just put the plane into a nosedive.  Well, first of all, why did the other pilot leave? 
[01:29:00]  They leave every so often.  You've seen it.  Haven't you seen that?  You've been seeing...  I've never seen a pilot walk back.  How are you doing, Dad?  I've never seen a pilot leave that cockpit.  He's still got the voice.  Even in the aisle, like he's walking back, you're like, hey, look, it's the pilot.  How are you doing?  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll just be walking in the back.  Got to take a leak.  And there's no bathroom up there on the flight deck, which used to be called the cockpit,  but that's a pretty funny word.  Well, you don't look to the rear of the aircraft.  I'll be taking a leak. 
[01:29:30]  And the co-pilot's up there with his Thorazine.  Looking up.  It should be okay.  You're incapable of hands.  But this guy, it seems, was suicidal.  And put the plane into a nosedive.  And the pilot gets back just in time to see him shutting off the engine.  Oh, my goodness, what are you doing?  And then he...  Yeah, he should say, Greg.  And then he tries to recover, pulls back on the stick. 
[01:30:00]  But I guess it was too late.  And then someone shut the engines off.  That's a good thing to do, I guess.  Who knows?  They say this plane approached the speed of sound.  Yeah.  Before it busted up and crashed.  And now they're saying it could be because the co-pilot was suicidal.  If you're suicidal, please, find a rock, go behind it, and blow your brains out or something.  Yeah, don't take out other people, you selfish bastards.  That is selfish.  Selfish, selfish, selfish. 
[01:30:30]  Crawl into a hole.  Do it yourself.  This guy now, if this is true, and he commits suicide and takes along 216 people with him, he's the biggest mass murderer ever.  That's just as bad as going into a place, opening fire, and then shooting yourself in the head.  What's the difference?  Could you imagine some guy walking into an office building and mowing down 216 people and then shooting himself in the head?  That would be the hugest of huge story.  Right.  But it's just a pilot committing suicide or something. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  So it doesn't seem that weird, but it's just as bad.  I mean, just as bad.  This guy took 216 people with him.  Yeesh.  So they're handing it over to the FBI.  Yeah.  We're going to find out more soon.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to just put the plane into a nosedive.  Enjoy the scenery.  If you look out the port side window, you'll see the wing rip off as we approach the speed of sound.  It'll be pretty exciting for the kids.  If they want to look out the other side, the engine just ripped right off. 
[01:31:30]  It's flaming.  That's it.  If you can't see up front, your window's probably blocked by the fuselage skin that's peeling back like a banana peel.  Very exciting sight to see.  Oh, look at the water.  It's coming up pretty quickly.  Get your prayers out of the way.  Anything else?  Maybe you want to jot down a quick note because we're all going to die.  Thank you for flying Egypt Air.  Those guys are always under control. 
[01:32:00]  Doesn't matter what.  Doesn't matter what.  I was laughing.  I was watching some dopey movie.  That movie about the sharks and stuff that came out.  Deep Blue Sea.  Deep Blue Sea, sure.  And it was the stereotypical chopper pilot.  Chopper pilots, I mean, they're even better than the regular pilots, than airline pilots,  because they are constantly just cool.  Right.  There is a hurricane that they have to evac people off of this offshore laboratory.  The wind is like 200 miles an hour, rain.  They can't see anything.  The pilot's just like, ETA, five minutes. 
[01:32:30]  And his face is just stomping.  They never like, he looks over his co-pilot at one minute and goes,  Holy ****, I can't believe the weather.  We're probably going to die.  Now, die just a little bit.  Why don't you get those wipers on high?  Look, old flaming hail.  Well, I've never seen this before, but I'm sure we could come right through this.  No problem.  Your stewardess is going to come around with your last meal.  As we plummet towards the water, try not to puke on your pals. 
[01:33:00]  Good thing your family's probably not going to get much more than a finger or anything,  so you don't have to worry about anyone identifying you.  That bang you're going to hear is a sound barrier.  We've just crossed it.  A stewardess just flew out the back of the plane.  Very exciting for the kids.  Just feel free to crap yourself.  Of course, the no-crapping light has been turned off.  You're free to crap around the cabin. 
[01:33:30]  Tammy, what's going on?  I'm a flight attendant.  You know what the guys do?  What are they doing there?  Okay, the minute that, right after you take off, it goes into autopilot.  And then after it goes to autopilot, they read books.  They read books?  It's all automated now, man.  They read books at every bump.  I'm like, what was that?  You know, you watch the movies and stuff, and you see, like, the pilot, you know, okay,  this is the tower.  You're clear to us in to 30,000 feet. 
[01:34:00]  And then he's like, okay.  And you see them, like, pull back on the stick.  That doesn't happen.  They have a dial with the altitude.  They dial it in, push a button.  The plane does the rest.  It goes up.  It goes up to 30,000.  And they're just reading books, playing cards.  I heard, I read a whole thing on this, a typical flight from New York to L.A., and the pilot and co-pilot are playing cards.  Cards.  Cards.  No fish.  Ladies and gentlemen, I've just, I've got four jacks.  I've got lots of turbulence. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, they're always very calm.  I'm very attentive to what the pilot's saying, too.  And I hate that, because a lot of times the air, like somebody sitting next to you puts the air on so loud that I can't hear it.  So you hear, like, the bing, bing.  I'm like, what?  What are you saying?  What, pilot?  I can't hear you.  Turn the fan off, damn it.  He's talking to me.  And I'm only catching, like, little words that are really alarming me.  Yeah.  That's all I want to know about a fire engine. 
[01:35:00]  Total hydraulic failure.  No landing air goes about.  Habit is flight, and we should be at our destination.  A flame in the cabin.  Like, what?  What?  What did he say?  I can't hear the pilot.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, and, hey, listen, a year ago I was coming back from Jamaica on an air Jamaica flight. 
[01:35:30]  That's got to be good.  And they blew an engine.  And they had the Jamaican guy.  I think he was smoking a Sprint in the cockpit.  And they're telling you how to prepare for a crash landing.  Are you serious?  I'm being, husbands are holding hands with their kids, like, praying and crying.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Freaking out the people.  And they put the bar away.  I was like, where's the bar?  That's the time to bring it out.  I'm telling you.  She's nuts.  She's crazy Jamaican.  Yeah, man, we're going to die. 
[01:36:00]  But we all die together.  We all die, die, die together in a flaming crash.  We're going to die together.  Love your kids, everybody.  I'm on the street, baby.  We store this for now.  I'm on the street.  I'm on the street.  You won't even care.  You're going to do it to shreds.  And I hope you like that.  Plains full of shoes.  You'll barely feel it when we hit the ground.  Looks like a big joint blowing up. 
[01:36:30]  Like a seed exploding in a big fat joint.  Does that mean that we're going to die together?  Man, and they tell you, they tell you, you know, take your shoes off, take your...  Is that why they always find shoes floating in the water?  I always wonder that.  Like, God, it blew the shoes off.  No, they tell you to take them off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying in a flaming crash.  We're dying.  We're dying. 
[01:37:00]  That's it.  Look at the wing.  It's covered with bamboo.  Bill.  Hey, how you doing, Oney?  Hi, hi.  I got a theory on why that plane crashed.  Okay.  I'm thinking that the pilot had too much slurpy, got a major brain freeze,  and just couldn't handle it.  God damn.  I am Tarbash.  I am pissed off.  I am the Egyptian.  The plane went down. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, my God.  I couldn't drink it no more.  That's it, man.  That's it.  Ah.  Wait.  Ah.  You're out there.  This is your pilot, Tarbash.  I am going to be cruising at altitude to death at 3,000 feet.  Have I told you that my life sucks?  My wife, my wife leave me. 
[01:38:00]  Three camels die.  And I stopped my toe walking into cockpit.  I'm very distraught today.  Oh, pilot, why don't you go and check the back of the plane?  I will stay here and watch.  I will stay here.  No, no.  I haven't even been thinking of turning off autopilot and engines and sending the train into death  type of supersonic speeds.  I haven't even dreamed of that. 
[01:38:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you look out your window, you will see our 767 engines leaping from the wings.  Don't peel on.  Just take your shoes off.  Because that's what you do.  Look.  Oh, as we see the skin of the plane peel back like banana.  Ray koala.  Here we go.  Into the water.  Don't worry.  You won't feel a thing.  Oh, my two-thirds friend, Tarbash, the Egyptian magician, flying plane. 
[01:39:00]  I am quirky, I'm all.  I'm so sad.  I'm so sad.  I'm so sad.  Thank you.  Good night.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:39:30]  It's a Kevlar kind of day.  1027 WNEW.  All right.  FM talking.  1027 talk.  You can't ignore it.  Opie and Anthony.  Manny in the studio helping us out.  And the fine female cops, Lisa and Karen.  Very pretty cops.  I was very surprised.  I was expecting two beasts to enter the studio.  I've got to be honest with you. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, my God.  That's awesome.  And Anthony's up first, I guess.  It's time to resist an arrest.  I don't want to be first.  It's fucked.  I was hanging out with Jay Moore.  It was like one in the morning when we left Paisano's.  I didn't even get to sleep until like two.  You knew it was common.  So now you've got an excuse when they kick your ass right now.  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of pussy in that.  Well, you better go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Anthony is taking his...  She said...  Wait.  She says the rules now. 
[01:40:30]  Because she gets all the guys on their knees with their hands behind their head before  you even approach them?  No, we can't.  Absolutely.  So what?  You say like, you know, get on your knees.  Get on your knees.  Hands above your head.  And then you holster your weapon, walk up to them with your cuffs, and then the second  you touch one of us, then we can start the resisting.  You got it.  So then we're going to start on our knees?  Yeah.  Oh, we got a couple.  Probably for our own benefit, to tell you the truth, because if she flips a leg out,  we're just going to go on the floor anyway.  All right. 
[01:41:00]  Well, Hank, get up.  You're first.  Oh, this blows.  Lisa is convinced she could get Anthony handcuffed within 30 seconds.  Oh, God.  Lisa, you have a real nice body, by the way.  That little belly shirt going on.  Dude, check out the other one.  Yo.  Wow, they're both really nice.  All right.  Oh, no.  All right, Anthony is...  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me explain.  Hank, get a mic.  Rick, get a mic to Anthony.  And turn the other way so you can face right into the mic. 
[01:41:30]  All right, Anthony is on his knees.  All right, hold on.  And you got your knees, your legs crossed behind you, too?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Lisa is behind.  Anthony.  Anthony is putting his hands in front of him like they're against a wall.  He's on his knees.  His legs are crossed behind him.  Lisa's got the handcuffs.  Wait, who's got the stopwatch?  I got it.  All right.  I got it.  Rick, you tell him when to go, okay?  All right.  I'll give you a five-second countdown, okay? 
[01:42:00]  Wait, you're starting from that position?  What's up, man?  Hey, hey.  Oh, what is this, man?  Hey, where y'all be arresting people at?  In Beverly Hills.  Right.  Yeah, we got to, like, fight a little bit.  Anthony's got...  Wait, wait.  Anthony's in...  Hey, you fagging out already.  My mistakes.  Oh, Anthony's just going to be a cop-out.  Ant's got his hands behind his head.  He's on his knees.  Okay, ready?  All right, hold on, hold on.  Ready, set, go. 
[01:42:30]  Go.  All right, Ant's fighting.  Whoa!  The cops got him down.  They are...  They're struggling with Anthony.  Oh, look at the hell.  They're all over him.  Ant's getting slapped down.  I love this.  Ant's fighting like a mother.  Okay, Lisa...  Lisa's got one arm, and the other...  And the other cop's got the other arm.  Ant is getting busted up.  His face is crunched against the couch.  They both have him down.  All right.  Oh!  He's up.  He's up.  He's fighting.  He's fighting.  God, I feel like I'm watching an episode of Cops.  It's at 20 seconds.  Ant's fighting.  Lisa...  Lisa's got him down. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, Ant's running.  Ant's running.  He's done.  He's on.  He's making his way for the door.  He's making his way for the door.  They're fighting.  Oh, they nailed him.  Oh, my God.  This is like Fight Club.  We just hit 30 seconds.  All right.  I think Anthony is tiring.  Lisa's on his back.  Karen's got the one arm.  Lisa's got the other arm.  Oh, my God.  All right.  One handcuff is on, and here goes the other handcuff.  Karen is screaming on him to put his other hand around his back, and Anthony is...  I can't see a thing. 
[01:43:30]  You're going to have to let me know.  Anthony is cuffed.  Cuffed at 58 seconds.  Hey, but they kicked his ass.  They did kick his ass.  Wow.  He ain't moving.  Holy cow.  Get...  All right.  Get Ant up so he can talk.  Oh, they're even lifting him up.  Goddamn, Ant.  You look like a...  Wow.  Ant, you look like a criminal right now.  He does.  He is out of breath.  He's on the lesbian couch right now.  Wait.  Get a mic.  Get a mic on him. 
[01:44:00]  Yo.  He's not moving from that couch, though.  Hey, yo, they're tough.  Holy...  All right.  You girls are kind of tough.  All right, Ant.  He's out.  Ant is exhausted on the couch.  I'm feeling in my right thumb.  Ah.  He made a nice dash for the door.  If he could have gotten out of that door, he was home.  Oh, yo.  Ant, how do you feel?  Exhausted.  Exhausted.  You look it.  Woo!  Shade.  Ladies, I must say, that was very impressive.  Wow.  She cuffed you.  She's got a belly shirt on.  The choke hold.  They put you in a choke hold? 
[01:44:30]  I didn't see that.  Choke hold.  I felt myself slipping away.  All right.  They're taking the handcuffs off, Ant.  Ant, I think you're officially part of Fight Club as well, by the way.  Because that was like resisting arrest and Fight Club all in the same thing, man.  Hey, Ant, you didn't fag out at all, baby.  Man, I was trying to get out the door.  You almost made it to the door.  All right, Ant's getting back to his little area in the studio.  Dude, let me tell you something.  Yeah.  At first, you could tell they were being a little gentle. 
[01:45:00]  Like, seeing how far I was going to take it.  At the point I tried to run away, I was put in a choke hold.  I saw that.  My head thrust to the floor.  I saw that.  The one cuff was kind of twisted on my arm.  I thought my wrist was going to break.  And then I just gave up.  I went, okay, okay.  And I actually said the F word.  Like, I was really being arrested.  I'm like, ah, they got me.  Look at how happy they are.  All right, how long did I last? 
[01:45:30]  58 seconds.  All right, that's not bad.  Let's prove to you guys out there that we can do it.  That was pretty impressive.  You're kick-ass, man.  Karen, how tall are you?  We know Lisa's like 5'1 or so.  I'm about 5'5.  Holy Jesus, man.  I'm going to have a small mortar.  Whew.  Well, you're a cop.  They're not going to give you the good stuff.  Oh, I'm just kidding.  You're next, Mark.  Manny, you ever see that happen in the neighborhood?  I would be nice to follow you.  Yeah, all too many times.  Yeah.  Manny, this is like a nightmare for you, isn't it?  Only rarely it's a white guy like me.  Yeah.  No, you believe me. 
[01:46:00]  Thanks, Paz.  20 seconds in, you was an average criminal, Ant.  I was.  I was fighting for my freedom.  When your hat came off, you was a cocaine smuggler, Ant.  What's up, my brothers?  Why are we being oppressed?  I'm going to start calling you Khali.  Yeah.  Oh, that was impressive.  All right, do I have to go next?  I don't want to go now, man.  Come on, don't you?  All right, I want to go.  You're next.  I'll go.  Oh, man, I'm going to look fagged up.  I've got to get a mic closer.  Boy, these ladies are rough, man. 
[01:46:30]  The harder you fight, the more they will fight you.  Dude, after seeing what you went through, I'm, like, shaking right now.  Whew.  Oh, God.  My heart is pounding, man.  All right, Opie's down on his knees.  I thought the lesbian's got my heart pounding.  Forget about it.  Yeah, this is good stuff.  Now, were they able to get the first cuff on before you started fighting?  Let me tell you, the second you feel metal on your wrist, you can start resisting.  But the second you feel it, one is cuffed. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, it's very hard.  I think Opie's going down quick.  See, but let's get the timer, too.  I got the timer ready.  Let me know when you guys are ready.  Hey, help me out, man.  You got my back, right?  Can I do that?  No, you can't.  There's one.  Oh, oh, there they go.  There it is.  Opie's on the floor, man.  They are fighting him.  Oh, wow.  They are fighting, man.  They're riding him.  All right.  They're both on top of him.  They got him in that damn hole.  He's kicking his legs.  I just saw two legs fly out.  Wow. 
[01:47:30]  Is he screaming?  Yeah.  Yo, this is real.  I don't know if I'm doing this.  One arm's back.  He's at 20 seconds now.  Holy.  He's got him almost between his legs.  He is fighting, man.  And 30 seconds.  Yo, they're playing rough.  Yeah.  They've got his head into the floor.  He's cuffed.  He's cuffed.  Wow.  Wow.  Jump out. 
[01:48:00]  Jump out.  I dumped.  I dumped.  I dumped.  Oh, they kicked your ass, man.  Come on.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up, condom.  Wow.  Get up, you criminal.  That was in 39 seconds.  How about that?  Holy crap.  You freely give that last hand over when they started hurting you.  39 seconds.  Holy cow.  I honestly thought it was going to last a minute, but they were pulling that right hand.  It hurts so bad.  You know what?  You freely give up the uncuffed hand. 
[01:48:30]  It hurts so bad.  It's like, all right, it's over.  It's like, I was trying to stay as long as I could, and then it just hurts so much.  I know.  That's how they got me.  Look at my wrist.  That's how they got me, dude.  Good luck.  Wow.  It was like a rodeo.  The way legs were flying up.  It's like a rodeo.  Dude, the way your legs were kicking up like a freaking Bronco.  I don't know what else to do.  Rick could be a rough one.  Look at his guns he's got.  Look at the arms on him. 
[01:49:00]  I just got my ass kicked by a girl.  It's like 5'1", 95 pounds to be beat up by a girl.  All right.  Well, Rick is up next.  Rick's got a couple of guns on him there.  If you look at his arms there, ladies.  We'll see if he's packing.  Ah.  Yeah, I didn't like the grabbing of the cojones.  I don't know.  After getting my face smashed into the rug, it was a little too much.  You've got to do what you've got to do.  I understand that, Karen.  Thank you.  All right.  And you're making your way over there?  Yeah.  Okay.  I've got to be able to see this, you know. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  Wait.  Who's got the watch for Rick?  Who's got the stopwatch?  All right.  Spaz is all.  Spaz is going to keep time.  Uh-oh.  Come on.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  His hands are behind his head.  Hands behind his head.  The second they touch, the time starts, Spaz.  Oh, they're going.  All right.  Rick's face on the ground.  He's curled up in the fetal position.  They've got both of their arms around his head.  Double headlock.  His one wrist is cuffed. 
[01:50:00]  He's sitting up now.  Wow.  They're having a tough time with Rick.  He's on his stomach.  No.  He's back up on his knees.  Whoa.  Oh, the one chick stepped on his ankle.  He's screaming, Anthony.  Yeah.  They are really pulling out all the dirty tricks for Rick.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Rick's doing quite well.  All right.  The cops are getting crushed.  They're having a tough time getting that arm.  Take him out.  Oh, his face just went into the floor.  All right.  Hold. 
[01:50:30]  Watch those cart racks.  All right.  Rick is screaming.  They're just bending his arm now.  Rick is screaming.  They've done it, though.  Rick is screaming in pain.  He doesn't want to give up that arm.  He doesn't want to give up the arm, but he's going to have to.  Here we go.  Here it comes.  Give it up, Rick.  He went a minute.  He went a minute so far.  He's running out of steam, though, Ant.  He is really resisting, man.  Oh, they got the chokehold on him now.  They almost had that arm behind him twice.  There it goes. 
[01:51:00]  There it goes.  One arm.  He's rolling back over again.  No one talking trash, though.  Everyone is saving their breath.  Oh, my God.  She's got him in the chokehold.  Rick is exhausted.  Rick is exhausted.  We're up to a minute and a half.  Oh.  Rick doing a great job.  A minute and a half.  Oh, there it is.  His butt is kind of...  Whoa, he is putting up a fight.  There's stuff flying. 
[01:51:30]  A minute and a 45.  Oh, he's grabbing the package.  That's not good.  I knew Rick would put up a good fight.  He's got them arms.  He's already cuffed.  Two people.  Yeah, I know.  That's true, too.  We're a little tired from cuffing Ant, but Rick is definitely...  Watch the cart wrap.  Ant is definitely...  Ant is definitely...  Ant, Rick's definitely doing a good job here.  Ow.  Oh, he said ow.  That's not a good sign.  Well, he's not...  He is not giving up, man.  The one cop has her knee on Rick's throat right now.  On his head.  On his head and tall. 
[01:52:00]  Rick is screaming.  Oh, look.  He goes, all right, all right.  Time.  Time.  Two minutes, 15 seconds.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Son of a whore, he says.  He is in pain.  The girls are exhausted.  The more you fight, the more they'll fight, Rick.  Them's the rules.  Oh, they want to leave him cocked.  All right.  Whoa.  Rick is not getting up.  You all right, Rick?  He's exhausted.  Look at that.  That was brutal.  Fight club. 
[01:52:30]  That was brutal.  That was great.  I saw a knee on Rick's cheek at one point.  Rick is the champion.  He lasted two minutes, 15 seconds.  His face was...  You know something?  Rick can take some pain because that cuffed hand was just turning white.  Oh, look at his wrist.  There, man.  Look how great they had that cuffed.  He wouldn't give up.  Rick, grab a mic.  Look at that.  They got you good.  Rick, what was the breaking point where you finally said, all right, all right, what was  hurting so bad? 
[01:53:00]  I thought I was going to get something, man.  I heard one point you said, all right, all right.  Yeah, it's because the cuff got so tight right there on that vein.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all black now.  Yeah.  That's where it was just like, okay, I don't want to break anything.  Right.  You all right, Rick?  We're sorry if we hurt you.  Look at his nose.  He's got a bloody nose.  Oh, you got...  Oh, you got...  What's that little move you do to take out the ankle?  Oh, you step on the ankle and you're pushing it in and they can't do anything. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  It hurts.  It's very painful.  Rick bleeding from his nose.  Wow, he's bleeding from his nose.  Bravo.  We have blood.  We have blood.  We like blood on the Opium Anthem show.  Wow.  I must say, ladies, that's quite impressive.  Look at the rest.  I've never seen his hair messed up before.  He's a wreck.  He started fresh.  We started after cuffing, too, of people prior to that.  So it took a little while.  Yeah, man, he's like a girl.  He was kind of tough. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I don't think girls need any excuses.  I think you did great.  Whoa.  Look at the cart racks.  Look at the weaning tower of cart racks.  We've got to fix the studio before we get out of here today.  Whoa.  I was really turned on for a second there.  Yeah, for a second.  You see what you did to your package to try to make you resist?  Oh, yeah.  I had a face full of my own stuff.  Yeah, you were.  You were completely in the snail position.  Manny, what do you think?  I'm pretty impressed.  I'm pretty impressed.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  I can't take anything away from the girls. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  You guys are pretty tough.  What a show this has been, huh, Ant?  Whoa.  I'm exhausted.  Rick looks out.  Yeah.  Rick, you look completely sped.  Rick, let's see the wrist, man.  Between hypnotism and getting his ass beat up.  I hope Rick's wife doesn't come looking for us.  Wow, look at that wrist, man.  Yeah.  Damn, that's good.  He was using, like, his ass almost as a block so you couldn't get the arm back around.  At one point, he used his ass to push me into that rack.  That's when you have to knee them in the cheek. 
[01:55:00]  That's when you have to knee them in the head.  I saw the knee on the cheek, which was a great move.  Your face was squished, Rick.  It was just like...  What's your name again?  Karen.  Karen.  Karen's stepping on my ankle.  She's stomping on it like that.  Yeah, she's kicking me.  I'm like, what the hell?  Karen scares me.  Like, Lisa does it with a smile.  Karen has this look on her face when she's doing it, and you don't want to mess with.  You've got to get the job done.  Yeah.  I understand that.  You're more than capable.  I'd hate to be married to her.

I was doing so well, but I fell into the rabble-rousing, troublemaking, race-bait-a-lion-sack-pit-a-doom.  Why I always make that same mistake on my way to the Senate.

[01:59:00]  1027 WNEW.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the cool club's clan?  Yelling and a-screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverenow.  Reverenow.  He's your pal.  Reverenow.  Well, he's sassin' off the people in his own community. 
[01:59:30]  Why is the white man always pickin' on me?  He's got a fat belly and his head's full of grease.  You hear his battle cry.  No justice.  No peace.  The man with a plan.  You know you can trust.  The party little reverend with an ass just like a bus.  Reverenow.  Reverenow.  He's your pal.  Reverenow.  He looks like Dave Brown with too many calories.

W.N.E.W.  Caitlin.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Caitlin.  How old are you, Caitlin?  I'm 28 now.  You're a little old to have the name Caitlin. 
[02:01:30]  I thought that was one of those popular names that only hit like in 1990.  Well, I'm sorry.  Caitlin is like the Gertrude of the Roaring Twenties.  Gertie.  Oh, Gertie, you know?  Hey, Gertie.  Back in the Roaring Twenties, I bet, you know, Gertrude was a great name for women and little  girls, but Mildred.  But you just don't see that name anymore.  Caitlin's the same thing.  Eventually, it's going to run its course, I think.  Ethel.  Men find Caitlin very cute.  Well, yeah, but there was a time Ethel was a great name. 
[02:02:00]  Ethel's a hot number, Rick.  I gave her quite a bangin' last night.  First, you know, those names all were cute in their day, too.  Like, yeah, those are all hot.  Like, back in the day, it was like, hey, man, do you see Bertha?  Yeah, I'd like to bang Bertha.  Oh, yeah, look at Gertrude.  What are some of those other names from the past?  From the Roaring Twenties?  There was Gertrude.  There was Bertha.  Oh, Abigail. 
[02:02:30]  Mildred.  Abigail's a good one.  There was Hortense.  What?  Hortense.  There was Judy.  Hortense?  Hortense.  Maybe in your neighborhood.  Hortense.  That was a name.  That wasn't Hortense.  I don't remember any Hortense.  Harriet.  Harriet used to be hot.  Harriet.  Can you imagine a hot broad today walking around the streets of Manhattan and her name's Harriet?  Imagine banging an Agnes.  Banging an Agnes.  So, like, I got Penelope doggy style. 
[02:03:00]  But, see, like, Caitlin works.  You know, you're sitting there.  Yeah, yeah, Caitlin.  There were probably some jocks in the 20s, like, you know, talking dirty to a Gertrude.  I rocked.  Oh, that's cool.  Not like a Thelma or an Eleanor.  Right.  Eleanor.  There's an Eleanor.  Oh, man.  Who would ever name their kid Eleanor after...  There's Eleanor.  Eleanor Roosevelt.  Yeah, after seeing that mug.  Eleanor is now, like, a lesbian name, I believe. 
[02:03:30]  You ain't had it till Winifred puts a hand down your pants.  They'd call her Freddy for sure.  Hey, Freddy.  Freddy.  Hey, Barney.  What about Hillary?  Hillary used to be...  Yeah, that's an old name.  Yeah, not as old as, like, a Bertha or a Gertrude or an Abigail.  Gertie.  A Harriet.  Harriet.  Oh, man.  When I got Harriet.  Yeah.  How'd about a hair going, yeah, Harriet.  You do it.  A Eunice.  Eunice.  Eunice is another one. 
[02:04:00]  I'm going to take you like Hitler took Poland.  A lot of fight.  23 skidoo, you bitch.  Hubba hubba.  Heard of the Roaring 20s.  I'm going to show you the Roaring 69, Hildegard.  Come here.  Oh, thank you.  Obi and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  I'm Courtney Cox.  From Friends.  From Friends.  She's dropping Cox.  Excuse me? 
[02:04:30]  She's dropping Cox.  On what?  What do you mean?  Well, her name's Courtney Cox.  Right.  Oh, her name.  She's dropping her last name, Cox.  Oh.  She's getting rid of Cox?  She's getting rid of Cox, yes.  Huh.  She doesn't like Cox anymore.  Why?  Well, she wants to use her husband's name.  She's married to David Arquette.  Right.  Courtney Arquette.  So she wants to be called Courtney Arquette.  She wants to drop Cox.  Well, she liked Cox.  Well, I guess she liked it for a while. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  It was very good for her and her career.  But, yeah, for her career, I would think she would, you know, hold on to Cox.  I wouldn't think she would just cast Cox to the wayside like that.  Well, she's moving on with her career without Cox.  Hmm.  So.  All right.  Sans Cox.  Mm-hmm.  Why?  Why?  I don't know why everyone's giggling.  I don't know either. 
[02:05:30]  If a girl wants to change her name, it's fine.  I just find it a little odd that she's been treated well by Cox for so many years that she would just dump it like that.  She's brave enough to live her life without Cox.  I guess so.  So.  Arquette.  Arquette.  Courtney Arquette.  Courtney Arquette for now on.  Not a hyphen?  Cox no more.  Right.  Huh.  That old gag.  You know, I actually felt a downward spiral in that bit. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, sure.  Of course.  Of course you did.  That's what you're supposed to feel.  There's no life, Boggs!  Oh, the other thing we have to mention is the book that's coming out on Reagan.  Really?  Mm.  And it looks like President Reagan didn't like Bush.  Really?  Right.  Reagan didn't like Bush.  Really?  Did he like Cox?  Or did he drop Cox?  Courtney?  I mean, well, would he know about Cox back in 81? 
[02:06:30]  Um, sure.  I think at that point, uh, during his, uh, presidency, uh, she was on that Bruce Springsteen  video, right?  So he was dancing in the dark.  So he was well aware of Cox at that point.  Oh, Cox was on the stage just shaking and, you know, remember?  Gyrating Cox.  Sure.  We saw her.  And she was dancing.  He forgot all about the Cox.  But with Bruce.  All right.  So, um, yeah, this book is claiming that.  Now you figure it doesn't work the first time. 
[02:07:00]  It's like putting sour milk in the fridge.  You go, nope, still bad.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dudes with Tudes.  Well, I think every time we open our mouths, we're, we're pissing someone off.  Opio Anthony.  You're next.  You're next.  We're out of control.  We're so lucky.  All right.  Knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  Uh, Anthony, the Post has a great story on your favorite, uh, TV host.  Who was that thing?  Uh, Star Jones. 
[02:07:30]  From The View.  Ah, yes.  I love Star.  She's a diva, you know.  Wolfie.  Whether, whether you think she is or not, she says it.  Yeah.  Well, I guess it's true.  Diva.  Anyway, yes.  The headline reads, uh, cranky view of Star Jones bash.  All right.  This is unbelievable.  Star Jones was nice, uh, nice enough to invite 60 friends to a barbecue at her summer place  in the Hamptons, but not all her guests were so nice.  One, uh, ingrate called up, uh, MSNBC to complain that guests weren't allowed in the 
[02:08:00]  house to use the bathroom, Anthony.  Instead, they were relegated to rented portable toilets on the lawn.  She wouldn't let the guests in her house to use the toilet?  No.  She didn't want guests using her bathroom.  Well, I got a reason for that, honey.  See, my ass is so big, I got a custom-built toilet bowl.  It's as big as a jacuzzi.  And I was fearful they would fall in with their skinny, narrow asses. 
[02:08:30]  I'm a diva.  Oh, you're a diva, right.  Also, um, there were complaints, uh, from people that, uh, were at this party about the  menu that Star Jones selected.  The menu?  What could be wrong with the, uh, menu?  Uh, well, um, Star Jones provided hamburgers and hot dogs for a guest.  Very nice for a barbecue, right?  Uh-huh.  But she reserved the lobster for herself.  Prepared by her personal chef, which she washed down with some champagne.  Washed down?  You can just picture it eating the, the shell and everything. 
[02:09:00]  Someone goes for the lobster.  What a witch.  Oh, it gets better.  So she sits there.  She sits there.  She's eating lobster and champagne.  Right.  And she's giving her guests.  Well, everyone else has weenies.  And burgers and hot dogs.  Burgers and weenies. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  And she gets the champagne.  I don't think she had champagne for everyone, Anthony.  No, probably.  Just mix up some Kool-Aid for them ingrates.  Get the great Kool-Aid.  And then at one point, she told the chef to make sure that no one else got her lobster.  Oh, that that was for her and not the guests, said a spy.  Hey, that's for me, diva.  It's star stock.  Get in the portable toilets.  You mud people.  I'm a diva. 
[02:10:00]  I use the bathroom in the house.  Star stock?  Yeah.  Star stock.  Star stock.  I don't know no limp biscuit, but I got budded biscuits and they're all mine.  Keep your hands off them.  I'm hungry.  Why do I sound like River now?  I love the red hot chili peppers.  Yeah.  Not the band.  I'm just eating red hot chili peppers.  Yeah, it's star stock.  Pass the corn.  Take a hand off if it even got close to her lobster and champagne. 
[02:10:30]  I'm a diva.  And who would want to use that toilet?  Imagine going into Star's bathroom because you know the first image you would get is  of her on that bowl. 
[02:11:00]  With her big old hair.  Big hair.  It's hard for me to line up.  It's like aim.  I got to use one of them, one of those northern bomb sites like they use on the bomber planes  just to line up so I don't hit the seat.  There's a lot of ass over here.  I'm a lawyer.  Here we go.  Let me line up. 
[02:11:30]  There we go.  Stay out the bathroom.  Star, I have to use the bathroom.  Use the tree out back.  It's Star's bathroom.  I'm a diva.  Here's another one.  That was a whole claw from my lobster.  That hurt coming out.  Oh, that's lobster tail. 
[02:12:00]  Look, it's hanging out.  Look, I look like a lobster.  Look at that.  Star, I really need the bathroom.  Use the pool.  Damn, that's a tasty crustacean.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This one's working out pretty good. 
[02:12:30]  Stay out the bathroom.  I'm in here.  Star, I'm a diva.  I am a diva.  I am a diva. 
[02:13:00]  Goofy and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys want to speak to.  It's a problem.  Hey, stop.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Gift shop, this is Jackie.  Hello, this is Ronald Reagan.  I was wondering if Nancy was there.  I need a change, and I've got to load my pants as big as the Lincoln Memorial.  You were wondering if Nancy was here? 
[02:13:30]  Yes.  No, not today.  She won't be here till Wednesday.  Oh, geez.  By Wednesday, my depends will be messier than the seat in JFK's limo.  Why don't you talk to my manager?  Hang on just a moment.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello, this is Ronald Reagan.  I'm just calling the gift shop wondering, well, what's the hottest selling item there?  Um, your autobiography, An American Life. 
[02:14:00]  I wrote that?  Uh-huh, you wrote that.  When the hell did I do that?  I don't know.  When did you do that?  I don't know.  Well...  Uh-huh, I've met you before.  Was I nice?  You were very nice.  I don't remember you.  Did you have a nice ass?  I don't know.  I remember a good ass when I see one.  You know, Nancy used to have a nice ass.  Now it looks like two big heads of cauliflower.  Do you have big breasts? 
[02:14:30]  Uh, no.  Do they look like the top of the Capitol building?  Because I like big breasts, like the ones on Ted Kennedy.  Hello?  Wait a second here.  Yes, this is Ronald Reagan.  Yes, you sound just like him.  I want to know if, well, my wife Nancy has stopped in yet.  Yeah, well, maybe you better check, um, let me have you check with our, um, cashier.  She might have seen her.  Jeez, old Ron's getting the runaround like the Pope in an abortion clinic. 
[02:15:00]  Nice thing.  Hello?  Hello.  Hi, this is Ronald Reagan.  Yes.  I'm looking for Mommy.  Is Nancy there?  No, she'll be here Wednesday.  One thing good about Alzheimer's, you meet new people every day.  Yeah, I know.  Would you like to talk to Sally?  I want a Big Mac and a large fries.  Oh, you do?  Okay, you want me to transfer you to Sally?  Yes, can I speak with Sally?  Yeah, hang on just a second.  I'll transfer you upstairs. 
[02:15:30]  Mrs. Sally, can I help you?  Hello, Sally.  Yes.  Hi, this is Ron Reagan.  And, well, I was just wondering if Nancy was there.  No, I'm sorry, Ron.  She isn't here right now.  We can expect her shortly, though.  Yes, I just wanted to ask her if this year I can hide my own Easter eggs, because I probably  won't remember quite where I put them. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, I can pass on that message to her.  Uh-oh.  I'm getting stiffer than Richard Nixon.  Really?  Yes, it's a horrible thing.  Have you seen my daughter in Playboy?  No, I wouldn't see that.  Have I met you?  Mm-hmm.  Several times.  Mm-hmm.  It's a pleasure meeting you.  Did you have nice cans?  I think you're getting a little absurd now, okay?  Absurd?  Dead sexual harassment. 
[02:16:30]  I'm sorry.  No, it's Alzheimer's.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Pro-net jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1027.  WNEW.  Dave writes, for your information, about two hours ago, Tom Brokaw was seen scuba diving  in the ocean doing a live broadcast to see if JFK Jr. was faking his death.  He is hoping he will reappear from the water and catch him in the air. 
[02:17:00]  Come on.  Well, you know...  I don't think Tom Brokaw's in the water.  I believe, finally, the story's dead, and they've run out of angles, so I wouldn't be  surprised if, you know, some of the networks did get some scuba divers down there to see  if something's going on.  But actually scuba diving?  Hmm?  Actually on the beach?  With scuba gear.  With scuba gear.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  You know, it's strange. 
[02:17:30]  I sound better with a regulator in my mouth than I do just trying to speak normally.  Normally.  Normally.  Hey, um, Tom?  Yes, Tom Brokaw.  You sound a little out of it today.  Well, I...  You sound a little light-headed or something.  I was deep diving looking for JFK Jr.  I don't believe he's dead.  I think it's a big conspiracy.  And I ran out of oxygen 200 feet below the surface and had to ascend so rapidly that Tom Brokaw, 
[02:18:00]  me and Tom Brokaw got into the bends.  Some nitrogen bubbles in my bloodstream, so I'm a bit of boozy.  But I do believe I did see JFK Jr. when I was, uh, just before I passed out.  I also saw a ricochet rabbit and the Care Bears.  They were all doing a dance.  And then someone pulled me out of the drink. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Now, Tom?  I believe it was a Navy vessel of grass still on site picking up any lost screw that came  from JFK's plane at the cost of millions and millions of dollars.  I was...  I was wowed by Arielle, the little mermaid.  It was nice.  You know, she's got nice cans for a cartoon mermaid, the little redhead chick.  You know, those mermaids, very deceiving. 
[02:19:00]  Yep.  Great cans you could, you know, feel.  But if you try to go south, it gets a little fishy.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightlander.  I couldn't tell where the skin ended and the scales started as I tried making love to a mermaid.  On my next report, Tom Brokaw makes love to a mermaid, flipping up scales to find the elusive 
[02:19:30]  mermaid gag.  You know what the odd thing is?  It smells like human.  Tom, while we have you in the studio...  What was the toughest thing you've ever had to say on the news?  I believe it was back in the 80s. 
[02:20:00]  It had to be the day that...  Oh, my...  The day...  Leon Klinghoffer was thrown off of the cruise ship Achille Gaule.  The Achille Gaule where...  The wheelchair-bound Leon Klinghoffer was thrown overboard by terrorists who took over the cruise ship Achille Gaule. 
[02:20:30]  Why do you always make Tom Brokaw say that?  Say what?  Oh, look at the time.  They've refilled my oxygen tanks.  I am still searching for evidence of the death of the JFK...  Well, good luck in the search, Mr. Brokaw.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony, as I now just turn back into the depths. 
[02:21:00]  Look out, we're welcome.  There you go, Tom Brokaw.  Swimming away.  Tom Brokaw.  Hey, he's having sex with a mermaid.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. </pre>
