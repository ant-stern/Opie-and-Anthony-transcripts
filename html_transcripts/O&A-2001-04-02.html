<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a profuse apology to O.J. Simpson for a false report the previous day claiming he'd murdered his girlfriend, Christine Proddy, and was using her severed head as a puppet.  They clarified that Proddy was alive and had been involved in a burglary, playing a soundbite of Proddy confirming her safety and presence with Simpson during the incident.  A prank call followed, allegedly from Simpson himself, containing threats toward the hosts.  Listener calls ensued, speculating on the burglary and leading to a discussion of a previous O.J. Simpson 911 prank call tape, featuring Simpson's joking reports of various drug and violence-related incidents.  The conversation then unexpectedly shifted to longevity, the possibility of 130-year lifespans, and the implications for sex and aging.  The hosts humorously envisioned the challenges of aging and maintaining a sex life, showcasing a video of a 100-year-old woman engaging in sexual activity.  A listener shared a tragic story of their grandparents’ 50th-anniversary trip, where the grandfather died mid-flight and the grandmother a month later.  This led to further discussion of aging, sex, and potential future medical advancements replacing aging body parts, punctuated by callers recounting embarrassing stories about their grandparents' sexual encounters and a grandmother discussing her first sexual experience.  A call from a CBS representative, Debbie, concluded this segment, noting that *Survivor* interview guest Kel was upset about not having been interviewed by the hosts. The hosts then joked about Kel’s denial of masturbating in the Australian outback, despite reports.

A subsequent segment featured Debbie from CBS promoting a *Survivor* interview, highlighting humorous moments such as a "masturbator line" and a worm-on-a-helmet anecdote. The show heavily featured a phone call with a Ron Reagan impersonator who portrayed the former president as aged, frail, and using extremely vulgar and offensive language, making crass jokes about his physical condition (broken hip), Nancy Reagan, and his supposed feigned Alzheimer's.  Technical difficulties interrupted this call. Following this, Mario Cantone and Eddie from *Big Brother* joined in studio.  Their conversation ranged from Mario’s experiences with reality TV (*Big Brother*, *The Real World*), his dislike for its lack of theatricality, his acting career (including *Sex and the City*), sitcom acting, theater experiences with Liza Minnelli, a children’s show anecdote, vomiting in movies, the negative aspects of fame, and numerous other off-color comments. Multiple callers also participated. The segment concluded with discussions of Sean Connery and allegations of domestic abuse, along with further movie and television show discussions.

A significant portion of the show revolved around allegations of Sean Connery brutally beating his wife, Diana Salento, after she befriended a hotel waiter.  The hosts recounted the alleged assault with vulgar and violent language, seguing into a broader, crude discussion about spousal abuse with offensive language and misogynistic remarks from both hosts and callers.  The show then shifted to a listener's unsuccessful attempt to reach staff member Carol Miller, resulting in a series of increasingly absurd and comical misconnections, eventually leading to a phone booth and then air traffic control.

The final, extended segment featured "Limo Anthony," promoting his limousine service. This resulted in a highly confrontational and comical exchange, culminating in Limo Anthony agreeing to have darts thrown at his bare back on-air as punishment for his perceived arrogance and self-promotion.  This was performed on air, with Mitch from *Survivor: The Australian Outback* and Stephen Lynch present in the studio.  The segment was filled with vulgar language, threats of violence, and negotiations regarding plugs for Limo Anthony's business in exchange for the dart-throwing, with numerous callers contributing to the chaotic and offensive banter.

The show also included a phone interview with Burt Ward (Robin from the 1960s Batman TV series). The hosts speculated about the implied homosexuality of Batman and Robin, leading to a discussion of Ward's career, potential appearances in later Batman films, and sexually suggestive anecdotes about his experiences with female fans. Andrew Dice Clay joined the conversation, adding to the often vulgar and humorous banter.  A caller, Marion, a self-described large fan of Robin, had her call interrupted and dismissed by the hosts as nonsensical. The conversation also touched upon the differences between the original series’ tone and the later films.  The segment ended with further discussion of Ward's career, current life, and more sexually charged jokes. Kimmy, a *Survivor* guest, was mentioned but didn't participate in the main conversation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  talk  talking out of one  crack  it's a sign of personal confidence  opie and  anthony show  1027  not funny  we don't often  apologize on this show  you know us  we're kind of out there we do things  sometimes we get people mad  I think we call it flying by the seat of our pants  flying by the seat of our pants 
[00:00:30]  taking chances sometimes assuming  too much and just going with it  right because we are not a news  station we are not CNN  and although the news stations  have made their mistakes in the past with facts  and they reported  the election wrong  and they're catching all kinds of flack for that  we don't often apologize for these things  but I want to issue  a formal apology  breaking news  opie and anthony apologized 
[00:01:00]  well I don't know  are you with me on this  oh  because I'm  yeah kind of  okay  it was the whole last hour of our show yesterday  I want to apologize to  orenthal james simpson  known as oj  oj simpson  I want to beg for his forgiveness  should we go back in time  you know we get the breaking news in the afternoon  yes  yes  you don't have time to decipher what comes in  sometimes you just got to go with it  you got to do what they say  a rip and read  rip and read 
[00:01:30]  they call that  rip and read  and then you have to start assuming things  before someone else gets on the story  well  opie that's what we did yesterday  at 6 o'clock  at 6 o'clock  we heard a story developing in Miami  Christine Proddy  OJ's girlfriend  her apartment  seems to have been broken into  right  these are the facts  this was the only facts we got yesterday  right  that her apartment was broken into  ransacked  I don't even know if that's quite the case  okay  screen door was opened 
[00:02:00]  we got the latest news  well you got to explain what we heard yesterday  yeah  yesterday  and then what we did  and why we're apologizing  and then we'll give you the latest facts  alright  yesterday we heard breaking news  the only facts we had  was that Christine Proddy's apartment was broken into  right  maybe some things were missing  correct  police were on the scene  there was a couple other things  there was a crime scene unit  there  because a crime had been committed  right  obviously the breaking  we assumed a lot  when we heard crime scene unit  we may have misinterpreted the facts 
[00:02:30]  and there was a helicopter hovering  right  now  we took the facts  and may have misinterpreted some  because  our take on it  we basically told everyone that  OJ Simpson murdered Christine Proddy  had hacked apart Christine Proddy  completely took her head off  and was using it as a puppet  as a clever ruse to the police  as the police went to the door  and they even showed us a picture of Christine Proddy  peeking from behind the door  but we said 
[00:03:00]  no no  she's still dead  OJ is working the head like a puppet  we figured  with some of the previous actions of OJ  and these new developments that our house was broken into  that he was indeed working her head like a puppet  to try to throw the police off  and give himself an alibi  what better alibi  than Christine Proddy  talking to the police  through just a barely open door  than OJ working her head  and saying  OJ left 
[00:03:30]  an hour ago  then they would say  she stole a lot  so we might have mixed  a couple of things up  we might have got a little  rambunctious  so yes  OJ  please  please forgive us OJ  I beg his forgiveness  now the facts are in  let's get the latest  on this story  we even have a soundbite  from Christine Proddy  who is alive  alright  we assume too much  police are investigating a burglary  that occurred Tuesday afternoon  Tuesday  at the townhouse  belonging to Christine Proddy 
[00:04:00]  the on and off again  girlfriend of OJ Simpson  detectives looking for clues  at the apartment complex  could be seen from Sky 10  their news copter  searching the area  outside of Proddy's apartment  investigators found  a latex glove  outside of townhouse  don't laugh  don't draw conclusions  a glove  so  but so far  there are no suspects  Proddy 26 
[00:04:30]  told police  she was not home  at the time  she found  a sliding glass door open  she also told detectives  she was missing  $2,500 in cash  and that is  the fact  as we know  now I'm hearing  tell  I haven't read anything yet  that she was indeed  with OJ  at the time  of this break in  if you can believe  what she says  we have audio  of Christine Proddy  Anthony  okay  let's go to that  I wasn't home all last night  so it must have taken place  sometime while I was out  I was with OJ 
[00:05:00]  all night  all morning  and most of the afternoon  so  I came home to this  all right  now she says  she was with OJ  the whole time  it's nice to see OJ  using real people  for alibis now  instead of golf clubs  you know  he actually has a speaking  human being  to give him an alibi  to where he was  uh Eric  what's up  what's up  ONA  you bunch of  backpedaling fags  what's the matter  did he leave a message  on your answering machine 
[00:05:30]  and said  I'm going to kill you  oops  oh no  wait wait  hello  Opie and Anthony  it's the OJ  uh  you best get on the air today  and tell them  uh the facts  that I was with Christine  the whole time  or I may come there  and use your heads  as hand puppets  for your next show  I could do it too  god damn  I will kill  most of you mother  where's the studio located  I gotta come and get that tape  I can't have a tape out there  would be angry

[00:29:30]  my grandparents they  were nearly a couple  years ago my  grandparents in their  late 70s they never  traveled anywhere  never want to go  nowhere afraid to  fly forbid to go on  a plane so they  hadn't been anywhere  their whole lives  their whole lives  maybe pennsylvania  jersey stuff like  that never flew  50th winning  anniversary we  finally talked them  into a nice trip to  Aruba how old  were they oh my  oh god my  grandfather was  almost 80 my  grandmother was  about 77 or  something like that  yeah so they  weren't too old but  they were old enough  finally get them on 
[00:30:00]  the plane after  weeks of coaching  them get on a plane  mid-flight halfway to  Aruba they hit about  20 minutes of  turbulence my  grandfather has a  heart attack and  dies on the plane  that's great thank you  all right thank you  no wait a minute are  you kidding  listen the story gets  better  well unless it gets  better it gets worse  oh my god that's  horrible  all right people  asking go ahead  oh no go ahead  I'm saying that  horrible  Tom it's an  uncomfortable laugh 
[00:30:30]  I know it really  isn't that  it isn't funny  my grandmother so  distraught now they  can't they don't turn  the plane around you  know so they land in  Aruba they call my  parents up my uncle  and my father they get  on the next plane they  go down because my  grandmother now she  won't get on a plane  that she's she's a  wretch that's a long  drive from Aruba  yeah right they'll call  what's that galfa car  service galfa car  service whatever  they'll come and get  you on time  well check this out 
[00:31:00]  so my father and  uncle go down there  they stay down there  a week and a half  because they just  cannot get my  grandmother on a  flight it's like  impossible they just  can't do it  oh finally get her  on you know they  they sedate her they  give her some sort of  medication to calm her  down they get her on  a plane they go back  home to New York  about a month later  my grandmother's so  distraught over this  she ends up dying  oh my god  so you know you say  take the chance in life  and you know you get  to a point where you  don't care anymore  meanwhile  50th anniversary 
[00:31:30]  the whole family's  like cursed now  because of it  oh well you know  something hey  they were  what an adventure  yeah some adventure  and they were  well you know  how many  honestly how many  more good years  did he have  yeah but you know  what I look at it  like why couldn't  this happen on the  way back  at least we had  a nice vacation  under the belt  you know what I'm  saying  I hear you  but what the hell  are they going to  do in a room  but bang in the  hotel room  go surfboarding  you know go go  sailboarding  what are they going  to get a Kawasaki  jet ski and tear it  up in the bay 
[00:32:00]  no they're going to  sit on the beach  and complain about  the sun's too hot  the goddamn bones  hurt  the food sucks  they love the heat  because he'd be in  mid-orgas and he'd be  walking around with  these wool sweaters on  so they love the heat  man you just  described my last  vacation  yeah wait a minute  that was Opie  oh the weather sucks  the food's horrible  the weird thing is  that the whole family  chips in you know  everybody's got to  pull in their money  make the plans 
[00:32:30]  reservations  all this that  and the old  crocodile  well see  that might happen  but  they should still  get their ass  on the plane  I understand  see the odds are  that everything  will be fine  but sometimes  things yes  do happen  and the thing  about it was  the airlines  wouldn't even  give us a refund  they won't even  like give us  the money back  or anything  for the other  trip back  yeah  if I count right  there's a one way  ticket from Aruba  back that isn't  being used 
[00:33:00]  they gave us  a percentage  of the flight fee  I mean it was  nowhere near  what we chilled  out for  I mean it was  ridiculous man  you know  it was horrible  at least you got to  enjoy the really  bad turbulence  alright Tom  thanks boys  no problem  love my stupid radio  I still thank you  Tom you did good  I still stand by  what I said  old people should  not be afraid  to fly  to do anything  get out there  just gonna find you  sitting in your  god damn recliner  anyway  when the phone calls 
[00:33:30]  aren't being answered  and Junior goes  over the house  that's all they're  gonna do  you might as well  go out in a blaze  of glory on some  turbulence on the way  to Aruba  see even though  he didn't make it  that's still kind  of cool  it's better than  the old lady  trying to wake  him up in bed  the next morning  and all of a sudden  he's cold  oh jeez  well come on  he's cold  you're on your  mind today  why are you  in such a  f***  mood  wait you can't 
[00:34:00]  say that  you're on your  mind though  wow  Anthony lots of  instant feedback  coming in today  Bill from  Cliffside  how nasty  is a 130  year old  woman gonna  be  she's gonna  look like  a deflated  football  my god  because at  70 and 80  the body  is just being  pulled down  the most you  could do  is hope  to be like  in your 60s  and end up  like some  of these women  that you see  can you name  one in their  60s that people  still consider  to be hot 
[00:34:30]  I bet you  Raquel Welch  how old is she  I was gonna say  Raquel Welch  she's gotta be  the other one  Angie Dickinson  there Jay Moore  was just talking  about her  you know that's  the best you  could hope for  so let's even  push it and say  70 years old  things are really  and for the most  part 99% of the  population by 70  it's over Johnny  what about Hugh  Hefner Anthony  he's living like  he's in his 30s  again it all  comes down to  the cash  and he's putting  these naked  women in his  magazine  so he's got  like a bevy  of the girls  that are coming  up to him  that want  to be in the 
[00:35:00]  magazine  do you think  he realizes that  but he probably  doesn't even care  if he was Hugh  Hefner the  accountant  do you think  these supermodel  twin bimbos  would be  hobbing his  knob  hell no  he would be  married to  like Joan  Rivers  right  right  but you know  something  that isn't  even a point  right  and then you  get like  imagine  130 year old  woman  what gravity  would do  to 130  years  during 130  years  it would be  like spending  spending a  normal lifespan  on Jupiter 
[00:35:30]  where the  gravity is  just like  pulling the  skin to  your ankles  boobs could  hit the  floor  literally  by 130  years  all right  Pete from  Long Island  it's like when  my grandfather  comes to my  house I know  the first person  he goes to  say hello to  is my  girlfriend  the hug and  kiss on the  cheek he gives  her is probably  the closest he's  had to sex in  30 years  oh how sad  is that  god damn  does that  suck  a hug  on a  young girl  oh my god 
[00:36:00]  it goes right  over to her  come here  honey  and old  men  and old  women  the differences  I mean  the branch  goes out  so far apart  as you get  older  like the old  men are still  thinking  about the  sex  the women  it's been  over for so  long  that that's  it  so you don't  think the old  women think  about sex  no  in general  in general  no there's a  few you know  ringers out 
[00:36:30]  there I'm sure  but for the  most part  the men are  still like  they really  want to have  sex I'm sure  a lot of  them are  non-functional  but think of  being a  functional man  in your  80s  you're still  thinking about  sex and  it's hard  enough to  find women  now  right  imagine  when the  population  has been  cut by  90%  and then  90%  of those  don't want  to have  sex  anymore  it's so  over  Pete  he knows  he likes  the girls 
[00:37:00]  in here  our own  engineer  Pete  of course  he does  Pete  what did he  say  I don't  do local  shows  oh he  only goes  on the  shows  that are  nationally  syndicated  Pete  the engineer  at  WNW  he's been  here for  what  for 35  years or  something like  that  yeah  and Ben  tried to get him  in the studio  to talk about  having sex  at an older age  we don't know  how old Pete  is  well if he  doesn't want to  come in  we'll just talk 
[00:37:30]  about him  without him  in here  which will be  10 times  worse  and Pete  said he doesn't  do local  shows  because he's  on the  Don and Mike  show a lot  yeah  a show that  is syndicated  across the  country  he likes  doing syndicated  shows  Anthony  and he  once strapped  a dildo  onto his  chin  and had a  stripper  sit on it  right  on the  Don and Mike  show  and see  he enjoyed  it  and he's  got to be  pushing  what  75  yeah  he doesn't  want to  come in  oh he'll  come in  alright  let's go to  Linda  yes  hi Linda 
[00:38:00]  what's up  oh I have  an embarrassing  story with my  grandparents  about 10 o'clock  at night  they're in  their early  80s  we all get  this phone  call  that the  ambulance  went to  the house  they picked  up my  grandfather  they took  him to  the hospital  turned out  a couple  of days  later  we found  out that  they started  getting a little  frisky with  each other  they started  getting chest  pains in the  middle of the  act  and now my  grandmother's  little diated  house dressed  and you know  you don't even  say boo  in her house  and just the  vision of the  two of them  going at it 
[00:38:30]  oh forget it  and I'm sure  it's just like  it's probably  just on the  verge of rape  because the  woman doesn't  really want to  do it  it's like one  step below  rape  come on  give it to me  I haven't had it  in 30 years  you bitch  spread them  it was nasty  though  I mean  it was just  insane  oh my god  the vision now  it's nuts  thank you  okay  you suck  you don't  I want to  talk to some  of these  grandparents  about  banging  Anthony 
[00:39:00]  yeah  where's  an old  person  Fred  what's  going on  my grandmother  she's 84  yeah  she  every time  we talk to her  every time  we go over  she says  how good  my grandfather  died  how good  my grandfather  was  and how  she popped  her cherry  and how  he knew  just when  to pull out  because she  didn't want  any more  kids  so  my wife  and I  came home  from our  honeymoon  and she  took her  aside  and she  was asking  how was it 
[00:39:30]  was it good  did you like  it  your first time  and I'm like  that is  disgusting  pretty cool  huh  that gives you  the heebie-jeebies  you don't like  grandma  talking to you  about sex  my wife  won't go  talk to her  by herself  now  somebody's  got to go  with her  when she  talks to her  grandma  should just  talk about  you know  she went  to the store  the tomatoes  are good  that's it  you don't want  to hear  anything about  grandma sex  that's what  grandpa said  too  the tomatoes  were good  the tomatoes  were good 
[00:40:00]  alright boys  thank you  her peach  turned into  an apple  that stayed  in the sun  for  an old  apple  what are  all the  implants  going to  look like  at 130  years old  all the  cosmetic  surgery  I mean  you've seen  Joan Rivers  she's had  all those  facelifts  and stuff  and it  just  now  she's got  like  go funny  eyes  looks like  you just  stretched  a latex  glove  over the  crypt  keeper  I think  the breast  implants  yeah  let's say

[00:41:00]  on old women  from when we  watched that  century sex  they're like  little thin tubes  where they connect  to the chest  and then they  they expand  outward  as they approach  the nip  and then add  implants  ooh  alright Anthony  you're going to be able to  spin them around  we've got to take a quick break  212-757-1027  we'll be back in just a bit  more girls  more good  hookers  for everyone  you want some of this  no longer

[00:42:00]  thank you  this is Mark  signing off  1027 WNEW  it's the Opie Show  and that would be  typical Robin Williams  just like  not being funny  babbling  just babbling like that  and everybody going  oh he's such a genius  it's that stream of consciousness  as he just like  oh look it's a baby  wow wow  why is that funny  it's a stream of sweat  stream of sweat  we gotta go to the phone  and talk to Kel 
[00:42:30]  from Survivor Anthony  okay  he's been waiting  a very long time  so let's get right to him  hey Kel  hey how you doing  is it Kel or Cal  it's Kel  Kel  yeah  hey what's going on buddy  good good  well um  you didn't really last  too long on Survivor  no only six days  and then I got the big booth  what happened  I got voted off  that's part of the game  yeah but what do you think  it was that got you  voted off  I think uh  the part of me telling them  I was an army captain  on day one  was not a good move  on my part 
[00:43:00]  why not  that would seem like  something that people  would want to have around  to help out you know  for survival techniques  and stuff  I think they needed me  when they got the crane  they had a compass  and the map  to get them to the  base camp  set up the tent  find out where the latrine  should be located at  stuff like that  but then I think  my importance  went straight down the hill  well the problem Kel  you didn't make an impression  you know you were  kind of like  you were kind of boring  you were kind of like  just low key  mellow  mind tone  not being friends  yeah that's right  you know I was  I was just going to 
[00:43:30]  sit back for a little while  and check the scene out  find out who was  who was causing trouble  who was not causing trouble  uh  I was going to play it quiet  my plan was to play it quiet  for the first week and a half  kind of coming on the radar  but I'd be there for a week  yeah  did you enjoy Australia  yeah I had a great time  especially when they booted me off  I got a chance to go to the Gold Coast  and I took some surfing lessons  and I learned that I'm a horrible surfer  I have no equilibrium whatsoever  you put me on that surfboard  and I'm going to be in the water  Kel it's true that after you get booted 
[00:44:00]  you have to hang out for a while  until the contact is over right  yeah you have to hang out  until everybody leaves  you have to stay the whole time  and the reason for that is  what if somehow  somebody finds out  who are the 16 contestants  and they see so and so  walking around the street  they'll go  okay that guy's not playing the game anymore  yeah Kel  I think we could have done the math there  thank you  yeah well  you know maybe  smart guy  is this true  is this true  I heard to make it interesting  because they were in Australia  they gave a kangaroo  hepatitis C 
[00:44:30]  and a Viagra  and it chased people  around the island for two weeks  yeah but you know  those kangaroos  are very aggressive man  they're all over the place too  did you see any wild beasts Kel  did I see any wild pigs  no  anything  anything  did you see any  a lot of kangaroos  a lot of kangaroos  no crocodiles  no crocodiles  none  and I didn't see any snakes  but there were a lot of  crocodile  you know  footprints  that kind of trail  in the mud  yeah I saw that  I think we were making  so much noise out there 
[00:45:00]  with the bongo drums  that we scared everything off  did you get to hang out  with any other people  that got booted off  after you got booted off  no I didn't  they kept you separated  they separated us  yeah  I had no idea  who's been voted off  and when  I mean  so when I watch it tonight  it's going to be a big surprise  for me  Kel let's get right to it  yeah  were you whacking it or not  what  were you whacking it  in the bush  oh man you have no sex drive  when you're out there  I mean when you're  a half cup of rice  yeah  you have no sex drive 
[00:45:30]  because you're so hungry  that all you're thinking about  is food  and for the first time in my life  it wasn't sex  it was food  and  it was reported  in the New York papers  that you were  you were caught  pulling your thing  but you know what  if that was true  don't you think  Survivor would have shown that  I mean we've shown  a naked homosexual man  on the first one  oh  maybe not  maybe you are going  to hit the camera  and they want to do it  yeah but you're going  to be known  for the guy  that was whacking it 
[00:46:00]  because now that's out there  it's masturbation  allowed in the barracks  anybody can make  an accusation  guys  you know that  well I mean  it was said  that you were  sneaking off  to eat some food  some beef jerky  you know there's  cameras all over that place  there's cameras  in the  cameras in the helicopters  cameras in the water  they're filming you  even when you're sleeping  I remember one night  I got up  and I banged my head  on the camera  and I was asking the guy  what are you doing  and he says  I'm waiting for you  to fix your nose  I mean it's amazing 
[00:46:30]  they had footage  everywhere  there's hidden cameras  hidden mics  everywhere  the whole place  was set up  so Kel  when you were whacking it  who were you thinking of  how'd you hide the hand cream  like I told you  my good friend  I'll tell you again  you have no sex drive  out there  none  none  I mean a half cup of rice  you don't have any  sex drive whatsoever  who did you find hot  what's that  who did you find hot  on the  in Australia  like I  the girls on the other team  guys  Elizabeth 
[00:47:00]  and  Kimmy Kappenberg  Kimmy Kappenberg  and Elizabeth  Elizabeth Polarski  Elizabeth's the one  from Boston  Newton I believe  yeah  and is the other one  the trainer  from New York City  no that's Alicia  Alicia  Alicia's a good looking  girl too  yes  but Kimmy's  from Long Island  yeah we almost  talked to her  yeah she's a fan  of our show  and she just  wanted to call in  and say hi  but the CBS people  got all panicky  like she might  give away a secret  but she doesn't 
[00:47:30]  know anything  right  we don't know  anything  because  because  Cal is it true  you don't even  know who won  we I have no clue  man because  once I left  that tribal council  I went to the  Gold Coast  I didn't see  those people again  they kept us  separated  so what type  so what type  of lube  say again  what type of lube  aloe from a leaf  yeah  or kangaroo juice  or tree sap  or just put it  in a hornet's nest  oh whatever  come on 
[00:48:00]  you have to have  a sex drive  I mean you have  no sex drive  when you're out there  I mean you guys  have never been  in a situation  like that  you just want  to understand  I've been hungry  my urge to spank  it doesn't go away  you have no sex drive  guys  you're saying  but see  see Cal you're  getting a little  pissed off  but it was reported  in all the papers  I have a sex drive  in the woods  I go to the park  and I rake joggers  yeah but I mean  you're right  that's probably after  steak and potatoes  my good friend  now if you're saying  after a cup of rice  that's all it takes  and you're not  horny anymore

[01:07:30]  to do that  you can only watch  so much  commit to a TV show  you can't even do that  oh no  it's South Park  Soprano  Sex in the City  I'm done  yeah  you do the  Sex in the City  I'm going to be  on Sex in the City  oh look at this  I was on it  once last year  and it created  quite a little buzz  and I'm doing  four more episodes  this year  so I'm a reoccurring  I'm a reoccurring  character named  Anthony Mandela  what was your part  Anthony Maratino  I was Kristen Davis'  wedding consultant  and I'm a designer  and she becomes 
[01:08:00]  friendly with me  this season  it's a very funny part  I'm a designer on it  basically  it's a good part  I had a good time  I love  I like the show  and Michael Patrick King  is the reason why  I did it  because he put me  on the damn thing  because I'll tell you  something  I can't get a sitcom  to save mine  bring it out  I can't  people go  you can make it funny  I can't make funny  that's not funny  I can't  I'm the worst  auditioner  I go in  I'm like  I can't do sitcom  I can't do  you get like a script  and you try to run 
[01:08:30]  through it  wait hold on  a second  hold on  hold on  I'm driving  okay I'm done  but I gotta tell you  that's a good throw up  isn't it  very good  every time people  throw up in movies  they cough before  I have never coughed  before I throw up  or coughed  during the throw up  you know how people  go up  they're like  like June Klayberg  in The Unmarried Woman  she throws up 
[01:09:00]  on the street  after Michael Murphy  divorces her  and she's coughing  and then green  comes out of her mouth  you don't cough  before you throw up  it's impossible  it's a bad acting choice  and people do it  all the time  and they should stop it  so you just go  bleh  it's a projectile  vomit  you feel it  from the gut  I don't mean to sound  like Stella Adler  but you have to feel it  from the gut  it's gonna come up  I'm Uta Haagen-Dazs  I know what I'm talking about  Ed  very good 
[01:09:30]  so we learned how to puke  so anyway  I'm gonna be on  Second City  so I'm very excited  I finally  and you don't like  the sitcoms  okay  you read the script  and then it's like  I'm a bad practitioner  I'm a real bad  even when someone  sees me and go  oh my god  he was great on stage  come in  I get in  get all nervous  I don't get nervous  I swear to god  it's almost like  I just  then they're like  you go on  and they're like  they don't want you  to be  they're like  okay  this character  we're having you  but we don't want you  we don't want it  being outrageous  or crazy  or flamboyant  I'm like  then what am I doing here  do you want me 
[01:10:00]  to take it down  a little bit  for reality  it's reality  it's revolving  it's revolving  you know  you crack us the F-bomb  I love you guys  I don't know  I don't know  you just crack us the F-bomb  I love you guys  hey I know you like the theater  so I'm going to admit something  I went and saw Cabaret  you saw Cabaret  sitting alone  I'm here 
[01:10:30]  I have a great lack  of an early story  it's so special  to be here fellas  I'm so happy  I can't hold my coffee  it's fine  it's dripping  I want some Coca-Cola  with chocolate syrup  and a jelly donut  can you get that for me  could somebody  that's what happened  this is the funniest story  in the world  so you saw Cabaret  let's start with that  first of all  my very good friend  Fred Ebb  wrote that show  in John Candor  it wasn't that bad 
[01:11:00]  it's a great show  look at me  I'm not really  a theater type of guy  but I went  and it was alright  Matt McGrath  you saw him do the MC  he was brilliant  he was really good  he was a good friend  he was so brilliant  I gotta go see it again  but you ever see the movie  no  oh the movies  brilliant  and it's not  a musical  where they like  break out into song  all the musical  all the music  I just burped  right on camera  it doesn't say burp  it says cough  so I didn't press it  so all the musical performances  come out of like 
[01:11:30]  just the performance  in the Cabaret  I'll tell you something  it's a great great movie  Bob Fosse  he was brilliant  and Miss Manili  I didn't think  I was gonna get  the Oscar that year  I thought I was gonna get  up a sterile cuckoo  and then I did  and then I didn't  I didn't think  I was gonna get  up a cabaret  and I didn't  they made me  very happy  can I get  some cuckoo clothes  and chocolate  and a jelly  wasn't Desi Arnes Jr.  in the  the sterile cuckoo  wasn't he  I don't know  it was actually  Wendell

[01:21:00]  with a lot of stuff  but you know  do you ever think  people would still  remember it though  when you were doing it  did you think  like years later  people would still go  no  that's how  people either  thought it was horrifying  or they loved it  it was no  I had a little of both  there were times  I would tune in  and be completely  horrified of what was  going on  and couldn't tune away  made an impression  you know  I just got an email  yesterday from some  guy named Gene Jones  in Rockaway New Jersey  and it was such a nice  thing about being  a single father  he had a very dark  period in his life 
[01:21:30]  and his kids  used to watch it  you know  sometimes you get  I still get letters  and people stop you  all the time  because I'd always go  they're allowing  this man around  young children  he's insane  I had no idea  what I was doing  they were just drooling  and they had  the Hanna Barbera  straight smile  across their face  you know  they had no idea  what I was doing  and there you are  you know  being creative  coming up with things  you have meetings  with your production  people  to get these things  together  and then  when did it 
[01:22:00]  hit you that  I'm doing this  in front of drooling  children  that don't even  get the references  I had to slide  down this pole  every day  and do an opening  monologue  and the kids  were like  there's no idea  I was like  trying to be like  you know  Johnny Carson  it was ridiculous  monologue  to a bunch of kids  monologue  to a bunch of kids  and my producer  was like  are you out of your mind  you're like  tough room  I used to scare  I scared them  I scared the children  and the adults loved it  the adults will still  stop me on the street  and the children are like

[01:25:00]  I got a thing today  I got this from you  you just handed me this  please let Mario talk  about the Judy Garland  movie of the week  I don't know if anybody  saw it but I'll tell you  something  it was pretty  you guys  you watched it for a minute  you were like  I can't take it  when I was flipping around  I was like  can't lie to you man  look I accept you  okay that's fair  I'm like you know  Susan Powder  fat you're fat  fat times fat  is fat  fats are funded by  fat is fat 
[01:25:30]  your ass is fat  fat  I hate fat  my ex-president's  penis was fat  remember her  I remember her  Susan Powder  Susan Powder  and she would  actually sell  yeah she was a girl  with the crew cut  and she would  actually sell  breathing  you need to breathe  and I'm sitting there  going she's telling  people they need to breathe  yeah no crap Sherlock  don't even get me started  I'm living upstairs  with my ex-husband  that's healthy  and then she always 
[01:26:00]  had the picture  of her sprawled  out big and fast  yeah  and look at me  in my sweats  with my crack  in my ass  rolled up  so yeah  let me just say  that the movie  was brilliant  and the ratings  were through the roof  ladies and gentlemen  Tammy Blanchett  who played  Judy Garland  when she was young  was unbelievable  she was unreal  and then  Judy Davis  played her  when she was old  they switched  them too soon  the younger one  should have played  her a little longer  because  you know 
[01:26:30]  but when Judy  got older  Judy Davis  was genius  it was pretty great  when Judy got  because when she  came on  when Judy Davis  came on  her voice was  still low  right away  she was like  uh uh  really  and then  and then she  and then she  got older  and it worked  but at the beginning  it was like  she's already  drinking too much  see I had a problem  with the um  with the mommy  dearest thing  when they switched  the kid  yeah well because  it's a little stark  it is a little stark  and then the  the girl they got  to play the  older thought  oh my god  it was horrible  it was horrifying 
[01:27:00]  the kid was great  the kid was great  yeah the kid's crying  she just looks up  and goes  Jesus Christ  I'm not going to  play with you  anymore  ever  don't you take  that tone  with me  missy  and then they  switched to the  older one  she's like  why  what was  her opening  scene there  she's like  you ask me  it was like  the most boring  understand  understand  it was a monologue  she was doing  understand  boarding school 
[01:27:30]  understand  you have no  personality  so anyway  great movie  and if you ever  if it's repeated  get it or buy it  or see it  it's pretty  it's great  some of the  Judy Garland  things from  the end of  her career  when she was  on the talk  shows  or just  giving a speech  be careful  you don't  make them cry  it's a big  Judy Garland  thing  I love Judy Garland  she's one of  hey let me tell you  something  Frank Sinatra  loved Judy Garland  and Tony Bennett  loves Judy Garland  and you know  they're not  taking it up the  I had my 
[01:28:00]  hands hurt  so  I mean  you know  if you see  some of her  you know  what you gotta  do  I'll tell you  see her  CBS stuff  is on DVD  and on video  and I'll tell you  when you see her  perform live  she was insane  she was a monster  her voice was  bigger  she was emotional  I just like  the drunk  interviews  when she's like  oh my  you're so  marvelous  you're marvelous  you sing  you're thrilling  you're just  uh oh

[01:36:00]  it would be  Bridges of Madison County  oh my  the bridges  of Madison County  when you cross them  they will sing  to you  there may be  troubled waters  below them  but above  there's the moon  I made that up  I didn't think  there was a bridges  there wasn't  I make up  theme songs  to shows  I was in  a movie theater  with a bunch  of other couples  and every guy  was like this 
[01:36:30]  with their arms  folded  pissed off  that they were there  I know  well you know  I have to tell you  one thing  I love Meryl Streep  she's one of my  favorites on the whole  world  she's pretty great  she really is  she's a good actress  the problem is  when she was like  looking from the window  at Clint Eastwood  bathing  yeah when he's out  by the pump  and his shirt is off  I've seen it once  I didn't go back  to the studio  I think she's great  but you know what  I'm not a big Clint Eastwood fan  so I thought he was  going to whip out a gun  and kill her  yeah  well I was hoping  I mean anything  anything  she is the goddess  of the fan  I understand 
[01:37:00]  she is the goddess  you cannot kill  Meryl Streep  but I thought the  combination was a little  strange  and then him  like okay  I even watched  I watched it  it took me three times  I swear to god  I fell asleep every time  and then I'd have to  pick up when the HBO  showed it the next time  but I'm watching  and there's Clint Eastwood  driving out to the bridges  of Madison County  to take pictures  because he's a photographer  and it was like  done in real time  he's setting up the shoot  he's driving  he's looking at the bridge  he's taking the pictures  did I put my film  in your refrigerator  is that sexual 
[01:37:30]  and that was it  I mean I was  I was really trying it  well you try  I give you credit  you try  it's not a great movie  believe me  I don't think it's a great movie  and it's a retarded book  everybody read it  it was the worst book  in the world  reading  not everyone read that  well I did  okay what's the current  what are the current  chick flicks  no alright  anything  that was it  over the past five years  with Richard Gere in it  you know what  can't  what the hell  autumn friggin  and she dies in the end 
[01:38:00]  god damn death movie  that was the last chick flick  I saw  what about what women want  I won't go see that  I don't care  I'll be honest  I saw what women want  how was it  it was alright  it was a good comedy  I don't think it was a chick flick  no okay  well alright  but the title is chickish flickish  yeah  kinda  yeah  kinda like Mavsky  it's no  it was chick flick  you know  I mean chick flick  it's like fried green tomatoes  those movies  you know  well 
[01:38:30]  Steel Magnolias  Steel Magnolias  right  Steel Magnolias  is actually  a very good  very movie  really busting  apart those  very good movies  alright wait wait  wait wait  explain to us why  Steel Magnolias  is a good movie  because  I want to understand  as ridiculous as  Sally Field is  and as much as  she pisses me off  on inside the  actor's studio  when James Lipton  she's like  when I do an  emotional scene  I take imaginary  razor blades  and cut myself  up inside  you're out of  your mind  this is why 
[01:39:00]  these Strasburg  actors are all  crazy  because they  have to live it  Stella Abras  said do it  and move on  don't take it  home with you  Sally  take your  nun hat  home with you  and fly around  your friggin house  she was great  at the convent  Santanko  she was  I love that  she was awesome  and the mother  Sister Patrillo  I heard you  were flying around  the Belfry  today  yeah the gust  of the wind  would go  and she'd be  up on the  little bell  and that  compulsive  gambler  that you're  hanging with  Carlos  first of all 
[01:39:30]  anyway  Sally Field  gives a great  performance in that  movie  and Julia  Roberts  is one of my  favorites  do you like  her  oh I love her  she's awesome  I think she's  beautiful and talented  we're disagreeing  but you know what  we're still friends  right  and that's appropriate  that we can disagree  and agree at the same  time  but look  there's a lot of  chick flicks  that I don't like  either  but there's a lot  of like guy flicks  like I cannot do  the Schwarzenegger thing  I don't care  about it  I don't care

[01:46:00]  post today  yeah even  after he's  let's see  yeah he's  supposed to  be knighted  by the  queen  but they  want to  strip him  of it  because  well for  years it  seems he's  just been  smacking  his bitches  off  oh  come on  what's wrong  with that  come here  come here  you lovely  little 
[01:46:30]  come here  give us  a kiss  you stupid  bitch  gosh  Sean  Connery  is uh  well it's  quite an  honor to  be knighted  and they  they feel  like they  shouldn't  give it to  someone that  beats his  women  yeah  you know  well there  was controversy  with him  back in I  guess the  early 90s  he was on  an interview  with Barbara  Walters  and said  he could  imagine  hitting his  wife  two years 
[01:47:00]  after he  said that  he tried  to justify  the statement  in Vanity Fair  well let's be  honest  I think we  could all  imagine  hitting our  woman  oh my god  there are times  you really do  want to do it  but there's  something that  tells you in the  back of your head  that it's not a  good thing to do  well he tried to  explain it by  saying  sometimes you do  get pissed  and you imagine  a lot of  a lot of  things  Anthony  he says  to Barbara  Walters  about the  Barbara Walters  interview  in Vanity Fair  I was really  saying that  to slap a  woman  is not the 
[01:47:30]  coolest thing  you can do  to her  it's much  more cruel  to psychologically  damage  someone  isn't that  right you  slut  I'm gonna  take a  crowbar  and smash  you in the  face  I told her  to shit  what what  in the chair  oh sit  sit down  you say sit  very unusual  I have this  speech impediment 
[01:48:00]  with my  asses  I sit  come here  you're lovely  now sit  sit down  before I  smack you  bloody  bitch  yeah  this is a  great little  little  I guess  story on  what happened  years ago  his wife  at the  time  the sultry  Diana  Salento  became friendly 
[01:48:30]  with a hotel  waiter  the actor  ordered her  to go to  the hotel  suite  go back  to the  suite  and shit  there  and wait  for me  you're saying  sit right  shit  that's what  I said  sit  sit in the  chair  yeah  Diana  Salento  she became  friendly with  the hotel  waiter  so I said  go back to  the hotel  and shit  and wait  for me  she went  she went there  the actor  returned to 
[01:49:00]  the suite  and allegedly  allegedly  allegedly  delivered a  brutal beating  Connery hit her  not with the flat  of his hands  but with  fists  full between  the eyes  Jesus  another blow  follows the first  and then another  and another  until Salento  falls back  onto the bed  her face  a bloody  mess  the next  morning  the face  of one  of the most  beautiful  actresses  of her  generation  was ballooned  up like a  puffer fish  he beat the  crap out of her 
[01:49:30]  what a douche  I thought  talk to a  waiter  now get back  to the suite  and shit  there and  wait for me  you just  don't know  I'm losing  my hair  and it  pisses me  off  that's what  it is  going bald  hair's  falling in  my face  you bitch  it's your  fault  god damn 
[01:50:00]  but that  sounds pretty  brutal  you know  in a face  like that  my women  I like to  actually hit  them with  phone books  about the  body  so they  can't tell  I had a  good idea  remember Ike  Turner  from Ike  and Tina  Turner  he would  beat her  with a  car antenna  on her  body  so she  could perform  later that  night  and not 
[01:50:30]  be all  posed up  see Sean  Connery  doesn't know  the final  odds of  beating your  woman  you gotta  punch her  internal organs  like the  universe  imagine  but I like  the hotel  room thing  that's good  I and Mike  likes the  hotel  because then  he don't  have to  clean the  blood up  off his  own  floor  of his  own  house  well what  does Sean  Connery  think of  Mike Tyson's  advice there  Mike just  go shit  in a  corner  sit 
[01:51:00]  right  that's  what I  say  why you  keep  questioning  me  of course  I'm saying  sit  sit down  I don't want  them dumping  out of the  show  if you're  really  saying  sit  sit down  shit  that's what  I'm saying  like in a chair  it's a speech impediment  right  that's what it is  something with my  S's  I have a hard time  saying  shit  I like that O.J. Simpson  a good man  what's wrong  sometimes  you just  imagine that  you have to 
[01:51:30]  shit  and concentrate  sit down  in a chair  and concentrate  sometimes  I just like  to shit  down  on the toilet  wow  yeah so I guess  they're going to  try to take  his knighthood  away  I don't think  it means  the same thing  these days  people  what's the big deal  didn't Paul McCartney  get knighted  see him on armor  on top of a horse  jousting or anything 
[01:52:00]  maybe it meant  something in the old days  Anthony Hopkins  right  yeah  he's a knight now  Sir Anthony Hopkins  knighted  yeah now could you  send them all  into battle  like the old days  with big maces  and swords  could you see that  come over here  ow  chopped my hair off  it's only a flesh wound  that's great  the queen  will give me a sword  and I'll beat  my wife over  that head with  bitch  sit here  shit  Paul McCartney 
[01:52:30]  going into battle  swinging a big  battle axe  please  what does the knighthood  mean anymore  swinging the spike ball  you know what the old knights  used to do  lock up that snatch  remember that  that's not abusive  they used to put  those chastity belts  on them  when they went into battle  so the farm workers  and stuff  couldn't come by  and bang them  well then maybe 
[01:53:00]  Sean Connery  should be knighted  it's chivalry  shut up  get back to the suite  get back to the suite  you bitch  and sit there  and wait for me  I hit you with my  knight sword  and a big mace  and a  that big hammer  from Braveheart  remember that big hammer  they gave the guy's head in  and smack my bitch up  with that one  shut up  go with your waiter

[02:11:00]  gee thanks  just the spine  these aren't even gonna go in  they're too blunt  you got any hammerheads  mine's going in  yours is going in  and something to protect the spine  we'll take a break  and you're gonna take  darts to the back  right  next  I'll take darts to the back  alright  what  if it hits a rib  he could get quite an infection  in the bone  who cares  it's him  I know  that is not nice  why  what have I ever done to you  trust me 
[02:11:30]  I will take great pleasure in this  wow  god damn it  he tall  I can hit his pinky from here  Mitch from Survivor's here  he's gotta be 7 foot 4  oh my god  he's  wow  he's gonna throw one at me too  we forgot to tell everyone  Mitch from Survivor  Australian Outback is here  and Stephen Lynch is here  he just showed up  and we're throwing darts at you next  finally we got a show  Keith what's up  hey you probably shouldn't go for his back  he might hurt something  but the place you could go for is  throw him right at his ass  why not his back 
[02:12:00]  well you gotta  I'm a little worried about the back tail  with his spine and everything  what if we kill him  just if we paralyze him  and he's still rolling in in a wheelchair  going  hey no I don't take it personally guys  you know it's cool  I still like you  you need anything  alright Keith  let's see if he's up for that  peace out  alright  listen  on a respirator  we're gonna have to throw him at your ass  like a game of asses up  I'm not happy about it  and I'm sure you're not  but it's safer that way  shoot for cork  who's gonna shoot for cork  you're gonna have to pull your pants down  no no no no 
[02:12:30]  absolutely not  you gotta  no  like we're gonna  we're gonna enjoy that  hold on  I'm having a hard time  just listening to OBS  Limo Anthony  just pull his pants down  it's got  it's  no  no  the darts will go right through the pants  they'll go right through my skin  you're gonna be covered up  get a grip  it's either  this clothes  or none at all  no  the back  if we're doing the back  then you gotta take your shirt off  I know I'm not happy with this  but we're not throwing it through a suit 
[02:13:00]  one  no no not a jacket  what's wrong with the shirt  no I'll take the shirt off  I got a t-shirt  nah it's gotta be the back  just bare back  oh yeah  oh absolutely no  no  no plugs  you'll get plugs anyway  you'll never get another plug  never get a plug  ever  because now you're backing out  everyone was counting on  you know  hearing you get darts to the back  and now you're like you know  fooling around with the rules of the game  and help me out here  come on Ed  what bare back 
[02:13:30]  yeah it has to be bare  what's the difference  you have to be bare back  in a shirt  you think it'll hurt more  I don't think it's gonna effing matter  tell you the truth  once it goes through the shirt  which it will  it's the same thing  it's not like it's armor  you're gonna hurt me  you just gotta throw it harder  make sure it goes through  because Steve's trying to get video for the website  it'll just be  I don't want that on the website  whatever  no plugs ever  ever  ever  we'll even change the codes  we usually change the codes  when we like  fire someone 
[02:14:00]  we'll just change them  so this is it  either I walk out  and never be with you guys again  or have to get darts thrown on my bare back  yeah  darts on the bare back  t-shirt  this guy's saying that  he threw darts at his friend  and punctured his kidney  you got two  that rocks  this is just  it does rock  this is just  reminiscent of  Eddie Haskell  and Lumpy  I swear to god  come on  Lumpy  as Eddie Haskell  and poor Anthony  is lumpy  what kind of  to use the term 
[02:14:30]  from yesterday  Anthony  what kind of  underpants  do you have  boxers  see I don't want to see that either  I don't want you to see it  if you had the boxers  it was doable  right  Garrett  stinky  oh my god  trying to call you by your real name  so weird  I know  alright Anthony  I'm just saying  whatever he wants to do  shirt or no shirt  I mean  shirt's gotta be off  cause we gotta make sure  we're not hitting your spine  or anything crazy  oh for that reason  well that's good then 
[02:15:00]  okay yeah  so that way  no because I want to see him  topless  no I just thought  because you wanted it to hurt more  but I'm just thinking  well that too  hurt the same  once it goes through the shirt  it's over  and it'll just be funny  to see his stupid hairy back  and you don't want to ruin your shirt  exactly  there's so many laughs  involved with this  no I mean  I had a really  hairy back  I'm gonna enjoy this  I know you  and we're gonna do it next  so get ready  so we have the  the spine protector  so now we're going  just back  oh he's taking the shirt off 
[02:15:30]  no don't take the shirt off  until we're ready  what kind of spine protector  is that  dude you're giving us  a lot of credit  that thing's like  just as thick  as his spine  wait a minute  any deviation  either way  and he's still  you know what  five plugs is not enough  I want unlimited plugs  whenever I can  like Louis Black  no  come on I've done a lot  it's not like you got arrested  we're just gonna throw  a dart at you  you know come close  Louis Black was in a jail cell  for 28 hours  or whatever it was  you know that  but you did it 
[02:16:00]  almost alright  see you gotta understand  you don't do this  no plugs ever  you do this  you get lots of plugs today  and then you'll be known  as the dart guy  what about plugs  in the future  possibly  always have my mic on  at all times  annoying laugh  dart guy  no we cannot agree  to having your mic on  at all times  mic on at all times  you always shut it off  no you're playing  with the rules  we're on  game on  game on  game on  now let's turn on

[02:41:30]  nah nah  you know what I mean  of course  alright  what do you like better  oh my god  a face full of pallet pasta  or a face full of oysters  alright  are you writing a book Dice  no I'm trying to help you guys out  remember we were going through the whole thing  oh yeah  now listen  Dice you gotta hear what Kimmy did today though  alright what happened  we had Pete Best in the studio  you know who Pete Best is  yeah that guy  the guy that should have been the Beatles  and wasn't  and then they picked Ringo over him and stuff 
[02:42:00]  kicked him out of the bed  how awful is that  to go through your life going  I could have been  right  yeah  yeah I was the guy  but I had too bad of an attitude  so we're doing the interview right  I can't believe you had him on  yeah we're doing the interview  and you know  quite frankly  it was kind of  whatever  an average interview  and out of nowhere  Kimmy asked Pete Best this  Kimmy  I asked him if he was  kind of happy  when John Lennon got shot  oh that's nice  that's nice  how insane is that Dice 
[02:42:30]  that is crazy  I mean the guy had to get over it by now  no he's not  he's not over it  no he's not over the fact that he got kicked out of the field  did you do like drum lessons for $3 an hour  what are you saying  yeah  yeah that's it  can you imagine you could have become like  you know  part of history  been in the greatest rock group ever  and because um  you didn't know the answer  to paper or plastic  you wind up not in a band  how does that happen  I don't know how it happens 
[02:43:00]  what did he say  you're the ones that interviewed him  I told him  I'm surprised he's still alive  I would have taken my own life  by now  yeah that's got  that's got to be heavy to handle  it's got to be  yeah  but what did he say  I know what you're saying  he  but what did he say  nothing  he was kind of shy  and laid back  well how do you be shy  when you're on the radio  all people know is what you're saying  that's why  like if we all stop talking now  there is no radio  that's why Kimmy came out with that question  and that's why that jerk off 
[02:43:30]  didn't get in a group  right  you know what I mean  what was he shy about hitting the drums  I don't want to hit him too loud  I'm a little shy in front of people  get out of here jerk off face  hey Dice  yeah  what do you think of Robin  from the Batman and Robin show  remember the old TV show  yeah but at least he got on  no no no no no no no no no  yeah I know how it goes  that's what I say when I'm in bed with a chick  what do you think  you know what I mean  when I'm tugging on a pork tritz a little  oh my god  what do you think of Robin 
[02:44:00]  what do you mean what I think of him  I don't think of him unless I see him  was he good  was he good  at what  at the Batman and Robin thing  the show  well he was like the faggotito part of that group  what do you mean  the faggotito part  yeah  what does that mean  like Batman was all machoed out  right  you know what I mean  yeah  he had like the look  he got the chicks  you know Robin was  are we talking about the show or the movies  the TV show  yeah the show 
[02:44:30]  he was like all fire  faggotitoed out  he never got the broads  you know what I mean  yeah  so he'd have his head up the penguin's ass  half the time  so you're saying  he's probably a faggot  I'm just saying  that was like the part  that he played on TV  yeah I mean look at the colors  Batman was like  in all like  you know  you know  all of them like good colors  like black  you know what I mean  yeah  and what was Robin  heavy duty blues  right  and what was Robin  you know  they put Robin like in the pink 
[02:45:00]  with the yellow  with the yellow cape  faggotitoed out  yeah whatever they put him in  so you didn't like the Robin huh  I didn't say I didn't like him  I thought he was a nice guy  what you ever meet him  no  would you want to meet him  not really  why not  because who even thinks about him  well a lot  there are a lot of fans  he's probably like 83 years old  by now the real Robin  I don't think he's that old  well is he there  don't play games with me 
[02:45:30]  no  you got Robin in there  we got Kimmy here  we don't have Robin  I know you got Kimmy there  right  yeah Kimmy's here  Kimmy's still trying to figure out  pay-per-play  see we just  we were having a discussion  about Batman and Robin  we were curious of your thoughts  that's all  yeah everybody was checking in  with how they felt  about Batman and Robin  I think Robin used to  maybe  you know  play with the chubby Cyclops a little  you think so  yeah  I think Batman was sort of a turn on  because why didn't this kid  go get his own apartment  you know what I mean 
[02:46:00]  that makes sense  he's always creeping around  with Batman  oh Batman you're the best  though look at you now  so you're thinking Robin wanted Batman  I think he had a little thing  for Batman  you know what I mean  he enjoyed that pole  a little too much  when they were going  yeah  little chubby Cyclops  work on the side  Bat pole  Bat pole  alright  but why are you even talking about him  I don't know  he's there isn't he  uh Burt Ward  yes  how you doing Burt  remember Burt Ward  he was uh Robin  in the old Batman TV series 
[02:46:30]  he's the best  I mean who's better than Robin  you know  it always seemed like  Batman was the guy  that was solving the crime  right  but Robin was the one  with the brains  absolutely  you know Batman would fly off  the handle all the time  you know  and try to put Robin  like in the back  right  you know what I mean  like you're nobody  I'm everybody  yeah  I'm the tough guy  and you're nobody  right  but then Robin  would always come in  to save the day  like when he put his hand  in the sand  and pulled uh  Batman out of uh 
[02:47:00]  the quicksand that time  remember that part  of course  uh Burt  yes  you were always my favorite  see they're not fooling nobody  I knew you were on the line  well you did  that's why you said  all that really nice stuff  for the last 10 minutes  that's why I was trying  to egg you on  to get you to say something  oh I see  now Burt  if you were Batman  you would have all of a sudden  you would have went like  wait a minute now  I'm no faggot Tito  no no  Burt Ward  speak up for yourself  you can't be like this uh  you know this uh 
[02:47:30]  this other guy  the Beatle man  uh Pete Bass  Burt Ward  do you know Andrew Dice Clay  Ed Dice  shut up a minute  Burt Ward  do you know Andrew Dice Clay  no I haven't met him  but do you know uh  of course I know who he is  oh okay  that's who you're speaking to  that's who's on the phone  well  it's the Dice man  pleasure  yeah  so let me ask you something  when they did all the Batman movies  yeah  uh  were you a little pissed off  they didn't throw you in there  well  you know  it's always disappointing  when you work very hard  to build a character 
[02:48:00]  and then uh  they go a different direction  but you know look  they're in it for the money  so you know  it's a different kind of thing  they didn't want to have  family entertainment  they wanted a  you know more of a  hard edge show  and we represented comedy  and family entertainment  you know  and uh  as a result  they didn't want Adam or I  you know what  there were a bunch of humps  and you know it  and I know it  meanwhile guys  I'm going to put you in there  even when they made Shaft  with uh  remade Shaft  with uh  uh  Samuel Jackson  Samuel  yeah with Samuel Jackson 
[02:48:30]  they threw the other guy in there  yeah  it's good to see him  you know what I mean  yeah  yeah  that's what I love  about black people  they stick together  they take care of their own  but these humps in Hollywood  they remake Batman  that could have been parts  for you in uh  uh  the other Batman  Dice  what?  what would have uh  Burt Ward played  in uh  the Batman movies  they could have played like uh  Robin's father or something  Robin's father  you know what I mean 
[02:49:00]  yeah  like it could have been  another generation  another generation  hey Dice  these two uh  uh  Batman and Robin  and Burt Ward  and uh  they were banging  remember when you were  fighting the shark  yeah  when you were coming out  of the helicopter  yeah I remember that  hanging from that ladder  and using the uh  I have watched that  at least  fifteen hundred times  Dice  they were banging  everything in Hollywood  back then  these two  were you really?  we uh  we always treated 
[02:49:30]  our fans well  they went to the  conventions and stuff  and they'd make these  appearances  and bang everything  you know what I mean  girls sliding down  the bat poles  left and right  it was amazing  that's right  hopping up on down  on that uh  that robin pipe  that's right Dice  you know what I mean  hey Burt  do you like Dice?  uh  you sound like a  really interesting guy  Dice  that means no  oh excuse me  I didn't know  you were a tough guy  now  maybe I throw 
[02:50:00]  my cape on  all of a sudden  I'm interesting  I am not interesting  I'm a moron  he meant everything  he said Burt  yeah  you know what I mean  Burt  yeah I got the message  I got no problem  with you  I'm not you know  I'm not looking  for a fight  you said that  I think Burt  can kick your ass  Dice  I think so  you know what  he knows all them  tricks  I used to see him  fight  right  got a utility belt  you got the belt  they got the words  every time they hit  it would say like  pow  right  it would say  you know  hair pie 
[02:50:30]  it would say  potato juice  how do you compete  with that Dice?  you know  he hits a guy  in the face  hair pie putty  you know  it would say  on the screen  pie putty  you know what I mean  absolutely  like that  oh  I punched her  right in the pink lettuce  the pink lettuce  but the truth  like  you know  you probably had  a lot of girl fans  back then  hey Burt  yeah  you never punched a girl  in the pink lettuce  did you?  I don't mean punch  do you punch her  with the meat rocket  you know what I'm talking about  you know what I mean 
[02:51:00]  you get on  yeah yeah  those are obstacles  that are added  after we do the fight scene  right  the meat rocket  the meat rocket  yeah like you'd meet  like girls  like you'd probably  go to signings  and stuff  like in the mall  in Brooklyn  or something  yeah  right  and you know  you'd meet like  a hot little chick  you'd give her  a nice shellacking  after  shellacking  yeah you know  what I'm talking about  I'm using radio stuff  I like that  well you guys  Burt  you guys used to  go to those conventions  or whatever it is  the appearances  that Bat ran 
[02:51:30]  yeah I was on the road  25 years  and what used to happen  there  because I hear  tell stories of sex  going on with the fans  while you guys  were in costume  well I have a book  called Boy Wonder  My Life  which is  it details things  rather specifically  yeah  and it's certainly  a book for adults  it's certainly not for kids  but we had a good time  you've got to understand  it was a different period  in our history  it was the 60s  and into the 70s  and you know  into the 80s  and it was a different world 
[02:52:00]  I mean  you don't have  the same freedom today  you know  unless you take  some serious chances  yeah  you throw a bag on  and you give them  a trash  in the back of the car  or something  a trash  you know  you know what I mean  we had a lot of fun  and you know  there was some mystique  about superheroes  and their costumes  girls love to wear  our costumes  hey Burt  what do you think  of the ambiguously gay duo  that SNL does  what do you mean  you ever see that  the cartoon  no I haven't seen that  because I think 
[02:52:30]  it might be based on you guys  loosely based on  Batman and Robin  I would have to say  you know  when we did our series  everybody wanted to put  their two cents in  okay  so there were some  religious organizations  that thought  that Batman and Robin  represented the wish dream  of two homosexuals  but I'll tell you something  the reality is  Adam and I  were like  two hungry sharks  in a world  of unlimited halibut  and we were  very busy with ladies 
[02:53:00]  and didn't have  the slightest bit  of interest  in the same sex  hey Burt  could you give us  a Robin line  so we could  make sure it's you  wait a minute  holy ravioli  available at  Paisano  of Mulberry Street  holy ravioli  did you ever  like actually  you know  give any of these  chicks a shellac  and more your  wadi outfit  yeah  well are you saying  we have a lot of fun  even while we were  yeah of course we did  no I'm not talking  like you know  like when you get 
[02:53:30]  them up to the hotel  room where nobody's  looking  I understand  I understand you  better than you think  I know you do  oh that sounds  like fighting words  but let's just say  that we had  a very wild time  on Batman  and you know  it was a period  in history  where we took  every opportunity  and we had a lot  offered  any specifics there  I want to hear  some dirt  yeah like  you know  did you ever pull  a train with any  of these little  bat pigs  that were hanging  around the trailer  well let me just 
[02:54:00]  tell you  if you read my book  your eyes will  open up  even your  what's the name  of the book  Boy Wonder  My Life in Tights  it's not about me  being at Westbury  and you showing up  in the outfit  we do like a thing  on stage together  he's always offering  someone to open up  hey Bert  you have a question  for Dice  no you don't think  that would be a good  idea guys  what all of a sudden  I'm on stage  at Westbury  right  yeah  and all of a sudden  he comes like  oh look at this  it's the Boy Wonder 
[02:54:30]  look what happened  and like you get to  hear him like talk  filthy for the first  time  I don't think I'd do  that because we  have too much  respect to the characters  I've got a certain  charisma about you  no you know  I've got to be honest  with you  in all the years  of doing Batman  and the subsequent  appearances  never once  when we wore  the costume  did we ever  break character  in terms of people  that we met  at appearances  you know  we never  like took off  our mask  we were always  in character  when we were  in costume  right 
[02:55:00]  you could wear  the costume  you know  what I mean  yeah  what I did  with the costume  when I wasn't  making a public  appearance  is something else  but you know  especially on Halloween  but you know  the rest of the time  when we're out  in the public  we are very  straight laced  do you still  have a costume  actually yes  you do  see what happened  was the ones  on our show  were always  being torn off  from the fight scene  right  but what I had  is because I also  made personal appearances  I had a couple 
[02:55:30]  of my own made  that I would use  for close ups  in the show  and also  as a personal  appearance costume  when was the last  time you put on  a Robin costume  I think with my wife  last week  this is what I'm  talking about  now you're  talking my language  you know what I mean  you throw on the cake  you gotta all  lick it up  we're married  right  happily too  really  very happily  you know  I'll tell you  after  you have to go out  and you have 
[02:56:00]  a wild time  and then  that's a certain  period in your life  and then you have  other times  when you know  you can be  really happily  married  with the right  person  how long  have you been  married  ten and a half  years  isn't that amazing  what he's saying  guys  the guy's talking  about there was  a time in his life  where he was  having a great time  yeah  you know  shellacking all  these chicks  shooting oysters  on their asses  you know what I  mean  right  and now he's  happily married  yeah  he's happily married  that's what I'm  trying to figure out  right  in fact there was a  quote from my  book where we said 
[02:56:30]  it's a little on  the risque side  we said  thousands of  adoring fans  were inseminated  with bats  our ultimate  autograph  wow  nice  nicey  nice  oh my god  face full of  chili and send  them on their  way you know  what I mean  thanks for  meeting bat  boy  filthy animal  there's your  autograph  Bert  this is why the  Batman movies  got more vicious  we live in a  vicious time  I agree with you 
[02:57:00]  no one is  tuning off their  radio Bert  this is top  shot  that they do  with Batman  he's always  he kills more  people than  one or two  chicks in the  movies now  right  you know what  I mean  that's a problem  and then they  market it for  kids  you know I  don't mind  programming for  adults  that's great  but don't  market it for  children because  kids shouldn't  be exposed to  that kind of  stuff  I agree with  you that first  Batman where  Danny DeVito  played the  penguin  that was the 
[02:57:30]  second Batman  and that one  was really  really dark  that wasn't  for kids  and you know  what I'm  thinking of  suing them  for that  right  to the point  that it did  something to  my mind  hey Bert  did you find  religion or  something  no it's not  that it has  anything to do  with religion  it's just  you know  when you're  with a certain  audience so to  speak  you know you  play to that  audience and  when I'm with  kids I mean  like I'm really  good to kids  I love kids  at the same  time that doesn't  mean that when  I'm with adults  I can't have  fun with adults  right 
[02:58:00]  wait a minute  do you have  kids  sure  right too  alright so  you got kids  yes  you know just  when you say  you love kids  look what we  went through  with Michael  Jackson  yeah well not  quite the same  actually I have  I have a 10  year old daughter  from my current  wife and then  from the previous  wife I have a  35 year old  daughter  they're 25  years apart  and you see my  theory of fatherhood  is that every 25  years I sire  another child  that's really  you went through 
[02:58:30]  like a whole  lineup of wives  no not a whole  lineup but a  couple you know  and I mean it's  not easy to find  the right situation  believe me you  know  hey Bert was  your package too  big for the  costume Frank  wants to know  in line time  there did seem  to be a big  bump  it wasn't too  big for the  costume because  the costume was  expandable  it was certainly  bothersome to the  catholic legion of  decency  he didn't like the  way the boy  wonder bulged in  his tights  my opening act  Jim Norton is 
[02:59:00]  probably listening  to this he always  wanted to know  what you and  Batman were packing  did you stuff  your package  with something  no Adam used  to tease me  because of all  the heat that  I was getting  that I was  stuffing my  undershorts  with Turkish  towels  but you weren't  doing that right  no on the  contrary  I almost got  fired off the  series because  of that problem  I mean they had  me wearing  double dancer  belts and I  mean all this  stuff penal  restraints  testicle  punctures  but I'm 
[02:59:30]  telling you  the only thing  that ever worked  was this quack  doctor they  found that gave  me these pills  shrink you up  for a couple  hours  are you kidding  you would shrink  your package  and then I got  thinking about it  you know something  this could mess me  up for life  I might never be  able to have  children  so I stopped  taking the pills  and used my  capes and covered  wait a minute  wait a minute  I gotta answer  you would take  them pills to  shrink it  yeah  they weren't  going to have to  go back on the  air for the  second and third  season  yeah what pill  was that  yeah what pill  I don't know  believe me  but I got  scared taking it 
[03:00:00]  thinking this may  really mess me  up for life  hey Bert  yeah  how big  yeah what are you  packing  hey listen  I'm not into  that stuff  I'm not into  talking about  stuff  usually the people  that talk about  it don't have  it so I don't  want to talk  about it  no that's nice  but my opening  act you know  Jim  yeah Bert  if I had a 10  or 11 inch  I'd tell the  whole world  yeah  well you  shouldn't be  you're welcome  to do that  but I take  the more conservative  approach  I'm a married man 
[03:00:30]  now  you live out in L.A.  right  yeah down in the  L.A. area  yeah I know  where you are  sounds like a threat  doesn't it  no no I know  where I wouldn't  say because I  see this is the  thing when you  live out in L.A.  people always make  sure when you look  somewhere at homes  or you know  anything  to tell you  who lives there  right  and you know  I'm just like  you know  well they do that  in Beverly Hills  they have tours  that go through  and they'll drive  by the various  stars homes  and you know  that's where  so and so lived  and that's where 
[03:01:00]  so and so lives  now and all that  kind of stuff  hey Dice is  Robin your neighbor  no but I know  where he lives  because some real  estate agent  was dumb enough  to point it out  one time  you know  and this was  before I even  made it in  show business  yeah  well I probably  moved from there  that's not the right  thing to do  right okay  you know  you know  celebrities are  entitled to their  privacy  yeah  now I'm a legend  right  yeah that's a big  difference  right  that's right  Dice  you're a legend  in his own right  is a legend
