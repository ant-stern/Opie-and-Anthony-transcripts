<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with crude jokes about a physical altercation between Perez Hilton and Will.i.am.  The hosts then shifted to a discussion of Opie's newborn, his sleeping habits, and the gifts (including a bad bottle of wine from Dr. Steve) he'd received.  A lengthy segment followed on the Arizona immigration law, featuring heated, offensive debate and inflammatory comments about politicians and groups.  The show also covered police brutality in Seattle, based on a video showing excessive force, and the officer’s subsequent apology.  Extensive mockery and offensive jokes were directed at Connecticut Senate candidate Richard Blumenthal for misrepresenting his military service.  The show previewed upcoming segments with Laszlo (video game review of *Red Dead Redemption*), Bret Michaels, Kim Cattrall, and mentioned Joe Cocker and Cher's birthdays, including commentary on Chaz Bono.  Throughout, Opie and Anthony used highly offensive language and made numerous crude jokes.

The next segment started with a discussion of someone in 1950s women's attire, segueing into a discussion of gender presentation and a bearded women website.  This transitioned into a vulgar critique of the *Sex and the City* movies, specifically targeting Kim Cattrall and her physique.  Listeners then submitted increasingly absurd and graphically violent plot ideas for a fictional *Sex and the City* sequel.  The Gulf oil spill and Kevin Costner's involvement were discussed, initially praising his invention, then shifting to ridicule, including a humorous call from someone claiming to be Kevin Costner's brother, "Ted." A smooth jazz remix of Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train" was played.  Ian Halperin, a guest, made predictions, including one about Opie's son's baseball career and LeBron James joining the Knicks, also promoting his upcoming film premiere.

Ian Halperin remained a guest, discussing the secretive location of his upcoming film premiere.  He shared predictions about *American Idol*'s demise, speculated on Matt Lauer's alleged infidelity (recounting a past encounter), and revealed a blind item about a Yankees player's threesome.  Speculation about Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, John Travolta, and his wife followed, culminating in an on-air retraction to avoid legal issues.  Halperin played a sound clip from his past work as a sports announcer.  The discussion returned to his Michael Jackson film and a possible O&A invitation.  Laszlo, a video game developer, joined the studio to discuss *Red Dead Redemption*, detailing its violent content, Easter eggs (including references to the hosts), development costs, and sales projections.  Laszlo also mentioned a character named "Bonnie McFarlane" in the game, which he claimed he didn't create.

Laszlo remained in studio with Forrest playing *Red Dead Redemption*. Laszlo discussed his upcoming vacation to Croatia and a recent trip to Turkey, recounting humorous and offensive observations.  He mentioned seeing a strand of Muhammad's hair and navigating the southern border.  The conversation turned to Anthony’s new iPad (from Mohegan Sun), ebooks, the newspaper industry, and intrusive online video ads.  They discussed viral videos, including one of an older man punching a younger man, and drunk driving laws.  Forrest's recent fatherhood was also discussed.  The latter half focused on a critique of the show's "Worst of the Week" countdown, its bias towards Sam and E-Rock's segments, the lack of input from other on-air talent, and suggested audience voting as an alternative.  The production process and overly descriptive introductions were criticized. Listener calls to the "F.U. Line" and a technical support call to Radio Shack interrupted the discussion.

A final segment centered on the weekend countdown and Sam's prominent role.  Opie, Anthony, E-Rock, and Laszlo debated Sam's perceived self-promotion.  Sam defended his choices, citing production constraints and consultation with "Bladder and Cross."  The conversation became heated, with accusations of Sam being "uppity" and acting like "the boss,"  E-Rock dismissing Ian Halperin, and Sam's bits being described as "circumcision" and "mommy issues."  The argument escalated with insults.  George Wendt's inclusion in the countdown was mentioned, as was the lack of listener feedback and the show's structure.  The segment concluded with plugs for upcoming appearances, Lazlo's trip to Croatia, the hosts' appearances at the Borgata, other shows, *Red Dead Redemption*, and further discussion of Opie's baby.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, where are we at there, Sam?  Let's move on to this other fucking thing.  Right, so the Much Music Awards in Canada.  And Perez doesn't like the Black Eyed Peas new album.  He said nice things about those people before, but he doesn't like this album and he bashed it.  So then the Black Eyed Peas came up to him at this awards show and they were like,  why are you stop doing this?  Why are you, you know, insulting our album?  And he was like, kind of like, I can do whatever I want.  So finally, this is Perez. 
[00:00:30]  He did a video blog where he explains that there was a confrontation after the Much Music Awards  at one of the after parties between Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas, the lead singer or rapper, and Perez.  I am making this video as Mario La Bandeda.  That is my legal name.  What happened to me in Toronto happened to me as a human being and it should not happen to anyone.  Violence is never the answer. 
[00:01:00]  Ah, it sure is when it's against you, you dummy.  Ah, punch in the face.  Good for you.  If you're going to play that game, you've got to expect maybe some violence, you idiot.  My legal name is Mario Armando.  And I have something to say.  Violence is never the answer.  Blood should never be drawn.  Another person should never be hit.  That's why people die. 
[00:01:30]  What is he babbling about?  He was attacked.  Oh, attacked.  He's got to go hard at Black Eyed Peas on his website.  Otherwise, he loses his credibility.  Oh, I don't think he will.  Like, if he doesn't, then all celebrities know, oh, I'll just go up and punch this guy in his head.  And he'll stop fucking drawing cocks in my ass.  Black Eyed Peas are like the safest musical group that any black guy could ever be a part of.  Wait for the real gangsters to go, oh, shit. 
[00:02:00]  You mean I could punch that motherfucker in the face?  He's going to get raped after this one.  That shit.  Yeah, Sam's right.  For a shizzle.  Some hardcore fucking...  They're safe gangsters.  They're family-friendly Walmart, like, hip-hop music.  You know damn well there's going to be...  Ah, whatever.  Get some hardcore pipe-hitting niggas.  Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.  Wee, wee, wee, wee. 
[00:02:30]  Marcellus Wallace.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I got a ball gag.  All right.  It just kicks that door shut.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I've never...  I am recording this as Armando. 
[00:03:00]  Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.  And I can't believe this.  One punch in the face and I'll be punched in the rectum.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you fuck him.  That one guy said, yeah.  You fuck him.  What's that guy's story?  Yeah, yeah.  You fucking fuck him.  Oh, my God.  Brazil's going to take a real fast one.  He's going to get one.  Ain't going to be no Bruce Willis to fucking bail him out either. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, God damn.  That's Will.  Will's boy just beating his ass.  Could someone please Twitter Bruce Willis?  Someone tweet Bruce Willis and tell him to bring a samurai sword.  Ow, this hurts.  Ow, ow, ow.  Zed is hurting me.  Zed, you're fugly, Zed.  Oh, Zed.  Oh, God.  The O.P. and Anthony Show starts now. 
[00:04:00]  Previously on ONA.  Like Jonathan told me, and this is probably what I would do.  If you're going away for one night, you can bring your iPad with you.  But if you're going away for two or three nights, you got to have your laptop.  But one night, because the iPad is like the iPhone, you can't type on it with both hands  because you have to buy an extra keypad for it.  I'm a hunt and peck guy still, so I have no problem just going da-da-da-da-da.  I can type pretty quick like I do on my iPhone.  Oh, I do it.  I do it.  I have both hands down.  I can type like a 50-year-old woman. 
[00:04:30]  My name should be Edna Norton.  Edna.  What are you going to talk about?  I don't know what people would have expected, but it wasn't like, hey, let's talk about it.  Alcohol, because that's my thing.  It was the vibe of the thing.  This fucking guy came in like he was a funeral dirge.  There's only so much he could do.  Yeah.  So, really.  You're Bud or Bud Light?  He couldn't even name it.  Nobody knows my name. 
[00:05:00]  Cheers.  Cheers.  Oh, and this is the reason you got circumcised.  No, it was because basically, for whatever reason, the hole in the foreskin, the urethra there, it wasn't big enough to stretch over.  So, you couldn't get the head of your penis out of your foreskin?  Correct.  You basically bought a turtleneck that was too tight to put on. 
[00:05:30]  That's correct.  When you write, do you write lyrics first, or do you hear like a melody in your head first?  I, I, with this, I just let the singers write the lyrics.  Oh, yeah.  I try, I try not to.  I try to avoid writing lyrics if I don't have to.  I have a couple suggestions on the record, but that's about it.  So, you give them a beat, and then you say, okay, could you put something to this?  Well, I give them some chords, some music.  No, but I mean, like I'm like this.  I don't mean that.  I should have said that, but I mean, you give them the music.  I think that's the funniest question I've heard on this record so far.

Shut your fucking mouth. 
[00:10:00]  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm just warning everybody.  I had two hours sleep last night.  I'm a bit punchy. 
[00:10:30]  Two?  I think two hours.  So you're saying you had a good night's sleep?  I wish.  What happened?  Did you just keep getting up and feeding?  Well, I mean, my girl's cool.  She's like, just go sleep in the other room.  I'm not ready to make that separation yet from the little guy.  From the little fella.  Not ready.  Who I believe is trying to turn over already, even though he's 10 days old.  I think that's what his problem is.  He doesn't want to sleep on his back.  Because then you put him on your chest.  He sleeps like a drunkard. 
[00:11:00]  He's great.  You put him on your chest.  He's not asleep.  He's a good sleep.  And then, well, to calm him down.  Puking in the toilet?  Yeah.  Is that what you mean?  Well, he puked all over me.  So weird, man.  Your kid's puke?  Ah.  Ah.  Doesn't matter.  Someone else's puke?  Forget about it.  Yeah.  So I had two hours sleep.  And I think I'm starting to hear and see things because around 4.30 this morning, I'm holding him and he's like sneezing.  So I go, because this is what you do to a 10-day-old. 
[00:11:30]  I go, God bless you.  And I swear to you, I think he said thank you.  Oh, really?  That's how punch drunk I am.  And I'm not making this up for the radio.  As I sit here at 6.15, I do believe my 10-year-old kid just said thank you.  10-year-old.  10-day-old, see?  Yeah.  10-day-old.  Holy shit.  It's a great time to negotiate money.  10-day-old.  I truly believe he said thank you this morning.  Yes.  And I wish I was filming it.  Would you be freaked out right now if he called in?  Yeah.  I did, so thank you. 
[00:12:00]  You think I don't have manners?  And then I'm opening up the latest baby gifts.  And I appreciate everybody who's sending gifts in, but enough with the onesies.  I don't need onesies.  I don't need T-shirts with cute little sayings on it anymore.  I need Ambien.  I need a good night's sleep.  Start sending fucking sleeping pills.  Lots and lots of sleeping pills.  I got a onesie from Caroline's that says, future comedy star.  Ah, that's adorable.  So maybe I'll have him wear that from 1 to 2 p.m. today. 
[00:12:30]  Because, you know, his stuff lasts an hour before you have to change it.  Before he grows out of it?  Or he's pretty much grown out of the newborn stuff already, being 11 days late.  And he's about 11 days old now.  So what?  He should have been born 22 days ago.  So he's pushing a month already.  Oh, I didn't think about that in utero kind of growth that happens.  Yes.  Yes.  Enough with the onesies.  I don't need any onesies.  I know you mean well, but enough.  And then stupid Dr. Steve sent his yearly batch of horrendous wine. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah, he did.  And I believe you didn't get one of these, Ann, because I think this is sort of a baby slash  birthday gift.  Yes, yes.  Because I got a birthday around the corner.  Oh, well, that's great.  I don't need it.  That's okay.  You take it.  I got two bottles.  No, I wouldn't want to take your gift.  I got two bottles.  From Dr. Steve.  You take that.  Dr. Steve should go into wine labeling, because the labels are terrific on his shitty wine.  He really does a good job with the labels.  And look how he caps them off.  The caps look all professional. 
[00:13:30]  This looks like some silver oak.  I'm talking to the wine lovers out there.  Very nice, yes.  The cap itself or whatever, the cork, looks like a nice bottle of duck horn.  But then you get down to the label and realize it's another shitty bottle of wine from my friend,  Dr. Steve.  He's named these things after you, I guess, huh?  I'm trying to remember.  Well, I could tell you what the last bottle of shitty wine was, because I haven't opened it yet.  And this will reside right next to the other bottle of shitty wine that he gave me last year.  So you're letting it age properly. 
[00:14:00]  Yes, exactly.  Okay.  Exactly.  That's a good thing.  I'm hoping it turns into some balsamic fucking vinegar or something.  Yes, Kenny.  Yeah, but GH, it's no good.  If you put those bottles side by side, you'll see that the labels are, like, crooked and offset and off-centered.  Oh, and believe me, Kenny would notice something like that.  He sure would.  Yes, so you've got a question.  Oh, look.  If you line them up, that's way off.  Oh, wow. 
[00:14:30]  Okay, you're right.  Is Dr. Steve a drunk?  Yeah, so, you know, like, he's a doctor.  There's supposed to be precision.  Right.  Yeah.  And not there.  Coke Logic is going with my wine humor, because it sounds like he enjoys a nice glass of wine.  He writes,  He certainly does.  Looks like duck horn, tastes like duck shit.  Very good, Coke Logic.  I'm going to send you a bottle of duck horn for that.  Oh, he's going to love it.  Send him a bottle of that.  The label says, Dr. Steve presents Opie's Rancid Balls. 
[00:15:00]  That's the name of the wine this year.  Oh, okay.  Well, at least it's properly named.  You know what?  He would sell these to the fans.  Oh, yeah, absolutely not.  Fans would buy this.  If he had one bottle a year, they would buy it.  Of course.  Just for the goof.  It says, Opie's Rancid Balls, fortified with prostatic nodule juice.  And a hint of onion.  Oh, for the ball thing.  Right.  Oh, no, don't smash that. 
[00:15:30]  Boy, would that make a stinky mess in here.  So, thank you, Dr. Steve, for another bottle of your shitty wine.  The labeling looks terrific.  The corking looks wonderful.  Oh, wow.  Look how fucking off the labels are.  One is a good inch lower than the other one.  And they're the exact same bottle.  And they are.  Oh, and that one, very crooked.  Jesus.  Jesus, this is a man that applies dressings to wounds.  Yeah, exactly.  What are you doing?  You missed the wound, Dr. Steve.  Yeah, from a guy that scrapes prostates. 
[00:16:00]  Wonderful.  Hope you're scraping the right area.  That's where he gets the rancid balls.  Rancid balls.  And then we got some Deadliest Catch stuff today.  Yeah, that was nice.  I got a new shirt to wash my car in.  To worse.  Worse.  To worse your car worse.  Yeah, I like how they sent fucking, like we're up in Alaska, catching King Crab during the summer.  Yeah.  They sent hoodies.  Hoodies, right.  Wonderful. 
[00:16:30]  Today is supposed to be almost 80 degrees.  Yeah.  But hoodies.  Hoodies.  Whatever.  That's good.  That was nice of him.  So I just took one of the t-shirts.  Yeah, the t-shirt's all right.  Why are we getting all the Discovery stuff?  Well, Steve's apparently called them.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yeah, they're sending us stuff, DVDs of shows and things like that, so we can better, yes, 
[00:17:00]  you got Mythbusters.  Yeah, Danny got a Mythbusters DVD.  Season six.  I'm so excited.  How many seasons are they up to?  I was like a thousand seasons.  It's like the best show ever.  It's about to break the record for the longest show ever on television.  Oh, yeah.  It's fantastic.  I love Mythbusters.  It's going to break Gunsmoke's record.  Gunsmoke.  You got a couple more years, I think.  Yeah, Long Order's ending, right?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking dreck.  I couldn't believe it was on that long.  20 years.  Yeah.  I don't remember.  20 years, two black criminals.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Exactly.  Great show.  Some nice Asian terrorists.  Did they really?  Of course.  Why would they have anything?  I was watching True Lies the other day.  Not True Romance.  True Lies with Arnold.  Great movie.  That is one of Arnold's best fucking movies.  Yeah, it's a great movie.  It's funny.  Tom Arnold is fucking funny in it.  That made him a star.  It really did.  And then they gave him ten movies after that, and all of them were bombs.  And they finally said, okay, look, you got to step aside now for some other guys. 
[00:18:00]  The best and most refreshing part of watching that fucking movie, though, is the Arab terrorists.  They are Arab fucking terrorists that are trying to get nukes and blow up the United States.  But thank you.  No.  Why?  No.  Got to call you out on that.  Why?  Yeah.  Because when True Lies came out, the Arabs weren't a threat.  Oh, well, I know.  That was the problem.  It was probably to avoid whoever the real threat was back then.  I would love to know who the real threat was.  What year was that movie? 
[00:18:30]  Ninety...  Probably four.  Mid-90s?  Mid-90s?  94, 95?  It was after the Russians.  Yeah.  It might have been the Arabs.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the reason they had Arabs was because...  The Arabs came on the scene because of the first trade center bomb.  Ninety-three.  But it was still early in their run.  It was because of their, you know, their penchant for terrorism that they actually made them the bad guys in the movie.  Right.  But then we got so politically correct over the years that you'd never do that anymore. 
[00:19:00]  As a matter of fact, and I'm trying to remember the movie, but there was a movie recently that was being replayed where they said Iranian terrorists.  And Channel 7 cut out the word Iranian.  Excuse me.  It was the Goonies, and I tweeted that.  Was it?  Oh, you did?  Are you finally following me?  No.  They tweeted out to...  I got a retweet.  Oh, you got a retweet.  They blocked the word Iranian?  Yeah.  I was watching the Goonies, and I sort of remember the line, but there's something else in there, like fucking Iranian.  What was the other word?  Which made it like they had to bleep something, but then they decided to bleep the whole thing. 
[00:19:30]  There was an adjective in there.  And do they bleep Libyan out of Back to the Future when it's on regular TV?  I don't know.  Libyans!  Libyans.  But they, yeah, they...  They dub it in.  Arizonians!  Mexicans!  Arizonians.  Arizonians.  Fucking Arizona is not playing.  Going to shut off the electricity of L.A.  Yeah, they want to pull the plug.  Of Los Angeles.  Because L.A. is trying to do all kinds of shenanigans where they're not going to do business with Arizona. 
[00:20:00]  And a bunch of other states are jumping on board, saying that they're not going to do business with Arizona because of their law.  But Arizona's not going to step down.  They're going to hang tight on this whole thing.  They're going to stay with this whole thing.  And what is amazing is the amount of people in the Obama administration that didn't even read the bill.  It is.  And then you think, well, you think of something like the health care bill.  Well, it's thousands and thousands of pages.  It's hard to read. 
[00:20:30]  This is a 17-page bill.  It's 17 pages.  And they all have a comment about how racist and horrible it is, but they haven't read it.  They haven't read the fucking thing to criticize it.  But they go, and they said, well, we know what's in it.  Oh, do you?  How about you read through it and see how racist it is or whatever?  But Arizona's not backing down.  But you do believe Republicans don't read their bills either, right?  No, I believe both the same.  You know, both parties are fucked up. 
[00:21:00]  All right, good.  But the Democrats are just a little too liberal for me.  This time you spank Obama and his administration for not reading it.  But I would bet money it works both ways.  I think these guys down in Washington don't read the bills for the most part.  They have their, quote, people.  Basically, they have their own version of Love Buzz going, hey, can you fucking read this thing and tell me what it's about?  Because I'm too busy trying to get a male prostitute.  To escort me somewhere.  Yeah, and make sure my wife doesn't find out. 
[00:21:30]  Thank you.  Get back to me, Love Buzz.  Thank you.  We do have that, though.  The Homeland Security Secretary, Janet.  Yeah.  That one, right?  Yeah, Napolitano.  She's, oh, what a babe.  Janet, I don't think she's a particular babe.  No?  Oh, maybe I'm thinking of someone else.  Yeah, maybe I'm thinking of Kagan.  What a collection of pigs in that fucking administration.  Christ almighty.  That should be his platform, not one fuckable woman.  You can't even make a short list of fuckable women in Washington. 
[00:22:00]  I bet you can't do it.  Pelosi with her fucking popped out eyeballs.  Fucking Hillary.  Wow.  And those goddamn stump legs.  What a color.  They should have the women of Obama.  Barbara Boxer.  Well, you know she's not an Obama woman.  She's terrible.  They're all terrible.  Is there one hot broad down in Washington?  And then the lovely fucking...  Barney Frank.  Barney Frank.  Barney Frank.  He looks terrific in a cocktail dress.  Speaking of.  With his fucking old man balls hanging out. 
[00:22:30]  Right there on the cover of the New York Post is Michelle Obama and Barack.  They had a lovely state dinner there at the White House with the President and First Lady of Mexico.  And that Michelle Obama, they're talking about how glamorous and gorgeous she looks in this dress.  What is that lump of fat coming out under her armpit?  I mean...  She's a little chubbin.  Oh, God.  Then wear cover-up.  Just because you put on a nice dress doesn't mean you're... 
[00:23:00]  What do they call her in that photo?  It's right there.  Oy.  What?  Oy.  Oy.  A dazzling First Lady.  A dazzling First Lady.  Oy.  So the radio audience can't see Anthony reaching over his fruit punch for the bell.  You love the bell.  Oy.  A dazzling First Lady Michelle Obama.  Lovingly.  Yeah, but just because you wear a nice dress doesn't mean you're dazzling.  No, it doesn't.  Right?  She's not dazzling.  That fucking armpit fat is coming because it's a single strap thing. 
[00:23:30]  She's...  Opie, it's one strap over the shoulder.  I don't really think she should have gone with this.  She's average.  She's an average looking broad.  Average.  She's some...  Whoa.  Not in that picture.  Whoa.  Oh, fuck, man.  Whoa.  That is...  Whoa.  There's a word for that.  No, she's just average.  Yeah.  And just because she puts on a nice dress for a nice little meeting with a president from  a foreign lawn doesn't mean she's dazzling.  And then they were taking all kinds of heat for having this glamorous dinner during this 
[00:24:00]  tough economic time.  But even I'll defend them.  It's like everybody...  Everyone does this.  Every fucking president has done this during any type of economy.  They have these lavish dinners.  That has always pissed me off, no matter who's in office.  Yeah.  No matter who's in office.  Especially when you got your boys overseas fighting.  Yeah.  But I was telling you, I think the Arizona thing...  Yeah.  I think...  I truly believe now that this country is going to split right in half. 
[00:24:30]  A little Civil War action.  I completely believe it now.  And I'm just hoping that we don't have to fight, though.  Oh, bring it.  I hope we don't have to fight.  I hope it's just a very easy thing.  Which side are you on?  And you fill out one piece of paper and say, okay, that's it.  Are you first or a Guinness?  Because the Arizona thing, man, is getting ugly.  That's trying to cut L.A.'s power.  I know.  I don't think they could possibly do that, right?  Because that would be...  L.A.'s threatening to boycott Arizona and not do any business with them.  So now they have to negotiate with each other.  So now Arizona is not going to do business with California.  Part of Arizona's business is supplying California with power. 
[00:25:00]  So they're going to tell them to go fuck themselves.  They should.  They should.  Yeah.  They absolutely should.  And L.A.'s mayor blew that off.  But why blow that off?  Like, why would you want the power from Arizona?  Why don't you say we don't want a quarter of our power, which comes from you?  Yeah.  How about we shut off your water so you turn back into a fucking desert again, Southern California?  That'd be nice.  It's getting very interesting.  And the people in general, the majority of people, agree with this law. 
[00:25:30]  This has nothing to do with Americans' rights.  It really doesn't.  It's fucking, it really is a burden on the state of Arizona.  We here up in the north, in our liberal fucking little corner of the nation, the northeast, man.  And it's very difficult to relate to a state that is being overrun by illegal immigrants costing billions of taxpayer dollars a year. 
[00:26:00]  Billions a year to deal with this problem.  And they finally decide, hey, you know something?  For years and years, we've been saying close the borders or at least keep an eye on the borders.  It didn't work and doesn't work.  And you're a racist if you want to do that.  If you're a Minuteman, you're a racist.  Exactly.  So the state itself has decided, all right, we're going to do something, make a law.  We're going to start checking people out, making sure they have proper credentials to be in this country and with reasonable cause to search. 
[00:26:30]  They're not fucking just pulling people off of, out of their cars and trains and buses and saying, where are your papers?  Everyone's comparing it to Nazi Germany.  Probable cause.  You're able to ask somebody for their identification.  If they don't have it, get your fucking ass back across the border and do something in your own country to make it a better place.  You ever see a satellite fucking photo of the border of the United States and Mexico?  It is astonishing that you can see the border. 
[00:27:00]  You know how we were saying that there ought to be lines in the country showing the borders.  If you look at a real, actually it's a more of a vegetation oriented photograph.  You can see the border.  Yeah.  See?  You can actually see.  Because there's healthy, growing farmland and just good soil and everything else in the northern part, which is the United States.  The second you cross that border, it's shit. 
[00:27:30]  It's just, they're not doing it.  Do something!  Make your own corrupt country a better place to live and stay the fuck out.  Christ.  Or come legally, that's all.  Yeah.  I'm from the school we should have just left.  Gotta go up a little north.  There's a buffer.  I'm from the school that we should have just left everything alone.  It was working out for everybody.  Just, you know.  Let them have the Alamo?  Look the other way.  Let them cross the border and do all the shitty jobs for us. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah?  I like simplifying things.  When it was the good old days, they'd come up, pick the fucking cabbage.  Apparently, though, it's not as good as the good old days because when they're done picking the cabbage, they go to Phoenix, Arizona, which is now the kidnap capital of the United States, and kidnap people.  And cause ruckus and crime.  How many?  Two or three?  No, there's quite a few.  I'm not going to give a number because I always get chastised when I give a number.  Ten?  Eleven?  I get chastised.  We could sacrifice ten or eleven people for people doing shitty jobs. 
[00:28:30]  There's billions of dollars Arizona is spending on this illegal immigration problem of taxpayers' dollars.  They're finally deciding to do something, and they get fucking flack for it from these liberal shit states.  And it's going to split the country in half.  Good.  Good.  Bring it.  Oh.  Oh, I love it.  Oh, it's happening.  Brother against brother again.  The blue against the gray.  Let's roll!  I just hope we don't have to fight. 
[00:29:00]  Why?  I don't feel like fighting.  I have a big family.  I'm sure I'm going to have to take out a brother or two.  You'd think one brother would go to one side and the other like the old Civil War.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, Scarlet, my darling.  I am here in battle.  I think if I had a guess, I think most of my brothers agree with your political platform.  Yeah.  And me, not so much.  But I think most of my brothers would completely agree with you.  Uh-oh.  They'd be firing on you.  That's what I'm thinking.  They'd be firing. 
[00:29:30]  You'd be defending the illegal Mexicans.  Well, look, man.  They're going to have to climb up 40 stories to get to me.  Oh, okay.  Good luck with that.  Oh, you're fighting from your house.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh, okay.  I was figuring out I'm doing the same thing myself.  Hell yeah.  I'll just wait.  I'll fight from my house.  I'm on the high ground.  You've got the high ground.  I'll shut the fucking electricity off to the elevator.  I'll have enough food to survive.  You come and get me.  I'm not going easy.  I'm there.  I think at least two of my brothers are right with you.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You should be doing the radio show with them.  You guys would have a ball. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, boy, would you have a ball.  So you want this audio from Janet?  Yeah, let's hear her.  So what is this about?  She admits to John McCain that she hasn't read the Arizona immigration bill.  There's another one that I didn't realize she had neither.  How fucking Holder didn't?  Eric Holder didn't?  Eric Holder didn't read it.  How embarrassing.  And there's a couple of more that were asked, did you read the bill?  And they said, no, I haven't had a chance.  I didn't.  But I know what's in it.  It's 17 pages.  Why don't you just read it so you can say you read it? 
[00:30:30]  Exactly.  A lot of these guys do this.  They don't read their bills.  A 17-page bill?  They don't read their own fucking bills.  But Health Care and Patriot Act are like big ones.  Those are long.  I didn't even read them!  I'm saying those are long fucking bills.  Yeah.  17.  17-page bill.  You could read the fucking thing and see word for word what it means.  Really?  You don't even read the prep sheet every day.  This is two pages.  That is drivel, and believe me, I know what's in it.  Well, that's probably what they're thinking.  That's probably what they think down in Washington. 
[00:31:00]  And smarter.  That's right.  I don't need something as silly as a prep sheet.  And peruses.  Fart, pussy, dyke.  Okay, got it.  That's our stories.  No kidding.  All right, here's the audio.  I could ring the bell on that story, all right?  Here's the Janet Broad.  If I might ask, have you had a chance to review the new law that was passed by the state of Arizona?  I've not reviewed it in detail.  I certainly know of it, Senator.  So you're not prepared to make a judgment on it? 
[00:31:30]  Senator, that is not a law.  Let me just say this.  As you know and are well aware, that's not the kind of law I would have signed.  How do you know that?  You didn't read the fucking thing.  You know what?  And boy, what a hum and a hum and a hum and a hum and a that was.  What a fucking knee-jerk reaction, dummy.  God bless John McCain on this one.  Yeah.  Oh, he was calling them all out.  God bless John McCain for calling them out.  McCain was calling them all out. 
[00:32:00]  And they were just like, well, I haven't really read through it, but I know this is not a law I would sign.  Really?  How about you read the fucking thing?  Wow.  God.  And then it continues with the same woman, I believe.  Yeah.  And for what reason?  Well, because I believe that it's a bad law enforcement law.  I believe it mandates and requires local law enforcement or puts them in a position many do not want to be placed in. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, stop it.  When I was dealing with laws of that ilk, most of the law enforcement organizations in Arizona at that time were opposed to such legislation.  Bullshit.  Well, I'd be pleased maybe in writing to hear what specific aspect of the law would impede or harm law enforcement,  since the majority of law enforcement in Arizona strongly supports this legislation.  And unfortunately, both the president of the United States and the president of the United States portrayed it as that someone can't even go out for ice cream without being harassed, 
[00:33:00]  which is one of the more outrageous statements I've ever heard.  And now our own attorney general has, after condemning the law, said that he hadn't even read it.  Wow.  That's McCain, right?  Oh, yeah.  His asses, he really, shh, he shows his asses, but, shh, shh, shh.  How fucking embarrassing.  He's been knocked in the teeth over and over again.  Get a VC rifle putt in the bridge of your fucking mouth. 
[00:33:30]  Let's give him a break on his slight speech impediment.  How does...  Had his fucking nails ripped off one by one.  Good for McCain, though.  Fucking smashing.  Yep.  How do you not?  What does she do?  I mean, what is exactly her...  What, the attorney general?  No, no, no, that's Holder.  What is she?  Oh, oh, she does?  She's the head of Homeland Security.  She's the thing.  Okay.  So she's not read it.  Homeland Security, which kind of deals with borders on some level, and she doesn't read the fucking border law.  Yep.  And then condemns it. 
[00:34:00]  And condemns it.  What a dumb...  What a dummy, man.  Isn't that nice?  What a dummy.  This is regular practice in Washington, though.  I don't care if it's 600 pages or 17.  These guys are not...  Fucking reading their shit.  In this case, it's very important for these idiots to read this for their own self-preservation.  I'm talking about for their own self-preservation.  The closer they get to these November elections, they are fucking tripping over their dicks left and right.  They can't get this shit right.  They're gonna lose the goddamn House and Senate. 
[00:34:30]  You watch these motherfuckers lose it.  And the difference between this and a lot of the other ones is people know how small this law is, like, as far as...  It's very readable in one sitting.  And also, it's like polarizing states to fucking...  To boycott Arizona and try to hurt them financially.  And almost, it seems like, with the backing of the administration.  And the administration hasn't read the bill.  And I haven't read the bill.  So I'm not 100% for it or against it.  But I'm not a policymaker.  My job is to go...  Here's my balls.  They stink. 
[00:35:00]  That's my job.  I'm not the fucking attorney general.  All I do like Eric Holder and his dumb mustache.  You like him?  I do, yeah.  I don't love him, but I don't really dislike him either.  I think his policies are a little too fucking personal.  Maybe.  And race-related.  How about a kiss?  If you know what I mean.  Why don't we...  Of course we do.  Why don't we move on to...  Why don't we move on to other politics?  Because we got some...  We have a lot of great stuff today.  You want a high school teacher in L.A. 
[00:35:30]  Goes to UCLA and speaks in Pro-Mexican Revolution Rally.  That was a while ago.  That was a...  Oh, this is old shit?  I would say that's probably about a week ago.  Yeah, yeah.  That actually happened then.  So maybe...  Can we have somebody look up if he's been fucking fired?  Or any problems have happened to him, though?  So we shouldn't play this?  This is too old?  We can play it.  I mean...  Yeah, it's fucking business as usual.  So you don't need to do that one?  Eh.  All right.  And then Seattle cops tell man, I'm going to beat the Mexican piss out of you and stomp 
[00:36:00]  on man's head.  Oh, yeah?  Did he?  Huh?  Yeah, but it was...  So apparently he did?  He was an innocent guy, too.  He hadn't done anything wrong.  The cop?  No, the Mexican gentleman.  It was a bad, bad policing...  I'm trying over here.  I think the cop breaks down, so this might be worth playing.  Seattle police were video...  That's what got started on the police force with two bad knees.  I just wanted to beat Mexicans!  And my dream came true! 
[00:36:30]  Can we hear Mike Schmidt?  From 18 years ago...  It's right there.  It's right there.  ...with two very bad knees...  Listen for true.  My favorite part.  ...and a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I thank God that the dream came true!  True!  True!  True!  That is the whiniest baby cry sound ever.  Mike Schmidt's an animal, though.  Yes.  Don't say that to his face. 
[00:37:00]  Nah.  He'll kick a Mexican in the head.  He probably would.  Yeah.  Seattle police detained three people, including a Hispanic man, in their hunt for possible  armed robbery suspects.  Now, look at the man on the right, lying face down, without handcuffs, and not under arrest.  Listen to what one officer says.  You got me?  I'm gonna beat the f***ing...  ...dancing his head up, you know?  You beat me?  Seconds later, the man moves his hand, appearing to wipe his eye.  The officer kicks him in the head as he wipes his boot on his hand. 
[00:37:30]  A female officer stomps on his leg.  Police realize they detained the wrong man, lift him up, and let him go.  The video does not show a medic arriving on scene, even though the man has cuts on his  face, and appears to have trouble walking.  A freelance photographer captured the video.  So they kicked you in the head, man?  Yeah, they did.  Tell me why they kicked you in the head.  I don't know.  They just kicked me in the head.  They knocked me down and they kicked me in the head.  And you had nothing to do with what was going on?  No, nothing to do.  Obviously, the first problem here... 
[00:38:00]  Whoops.  What are the cops doing?  I'm just saying, everyone is videotaping.  Yeah, I know.  You've got to assume that they're just videotaping you at every situation.  You know what the thing is?  You know how many instances there are of things like this?  And how many of these things happen with no incident every second of the day?  Every second, someone is being apprehended by the cops and things.  And, you know, occasionally this stuff happens. 
[00:38:30]  Right, but...  It's like...  It's hard to defend, I'm going to beat the Mexican piss out of you.  It's like that quote in American History X.  You know, we do give the police a certain amount of, you know, a little fucking...  Leeway.  Power.  A little power.  Because we're not willing to do it ourselves.  So we give them this kind of power and they do use it and sometimes abuse it.  But everyone makes a mistake.  I've gone into a deli and gotten a sandwich that I didn't order. 
[00:39:00]  That is true.  But when you didn't get liverwurst, you didn't step and kick on the salami.  Hey, you didn't punch the salami.  You fucking piece of salami.  That's a rough one to defend.  Especially since the guy didn't...  I don't care about the politically incorrect language if the guy did it.  Yeah.  But the guy didn't do it.  It's like, you can't just, you know...  Yeah.  Detaining a guy is one thing, but kicking him and...  I know.  That's a rough one.  Well, we get to hear from the cop.  It was during this contact that I chose words as part of my conversations with that young man. 
[00:39:30]  With that young man.  All right.  You know what?  Now it's a young man.  Why didn't we set this up?  He was a fucking Mexican when he was doing this.  Conversation.  Conversation.  My boot was speaking to his face.  Yeah.  In Boudanese.  Yeah.  This is...  We have to set this up.  It's a fake apology.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is fake apology.  This is a fake apology that someone gave him a piece of paper and said, study this.  You're going in front of cameras in 15 minutes and you better make it sound sincere. 
[00:40:00]  Do you think...  We've all been there.  Fake tears?  Oh, I know.  I think he's afraid of losing his job.  Oh, yeah.  But the way he's phrasing it, I chose language in my witty repartee with that young gentleman.  By the way, fired, fired, so fired.  Oh, so fired.  Or maybe desk job.  Yeah.  You think desk job?  I don't know.  Because of human resources, you know.  They make it very hard to fire people in this day and age.  It was during this contact that I chose words as part of my conversations with that young 
[00:40:30]  man that were offensive and unprofessional.  The day has not passed in which I wish I could rewind the events of that night.  Or leave the tape.  And take back those hateful words.  Take back those tapes.  As a result of my comments, I have not only embarrassed myself, but I have truly let  down my colleagues.  Oh, boy.  Colleagues who, without thinking twice, would lay their lives down for me. 
[00:41:00]  To Chief Diaz.  Chief Diaz.  Uh-oh.  And all you want is a Chief McCluskey.  Hold him up.  Hold that Mexican up.  Not the first Mexican I've ever frisked.  It couldn't be worse than Chief Diaz.  It's not Chief Flanagan.  Oh, boy.  This is not going to be good for this guy.  How are the tacos here? 
[00:41:30]  Shoot him in the throat.  That's right.  I'm going to speak Mexican talk to Mike.  I want my brother coming out of there with more than just an enchilada in his hand.  We could tape the burrito behind the toilet.  Oh, my God.  Chief Diaz.  You don't want Chief Diaz.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He's in trouble. 
[00:42:00]  He's apologizing to good old Chief Diaz.  Would lay their lives down for me to Chief Diaz.  Men and women at the Seattle Police Department, I can only offer my most heartfelt apology.  I promise you that I will strive to be better and that I will represent this department in the most professional manner.  To the Seattle community, in particular, members of the Latino community, I know that my words cut deep and we're very hurtful. 
[00:42:30]  So did your boot heel.  That's the problem.  Yeah, words.  It wasn't so much the words as your boot.  This is really new, right?  That's, um, wait, no, that's...  A couple days old at this point.  I want to say a week old.  Yeah, about a week we can have.  All right, well, I haven't been here, man.  We could, uh...  I don't know what's old.  We could, uh...  Find out if the fucking guy got fired.  We would know by now.  Oh, that's Chief Diaz.  I want to know what happened to the guy.  And also, the Mexican high school teacher.  Not that I think he should be fired for speaking out and saying what he wants to say. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  You know, hey, he's a citizen.  But I'm just, I know that...  Barely.  In reverse would be a bunch of shit.  Yes, of course.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, that's some great audio.  Yeah, that is something.  You want to do our...  He's just blubbering through his whole apology.  We also have, because we're kind of doing politics, uh...  We got the Linda McMahon thing.  We got Alan...  Isn't that wrestling?  I love when she was giving a speech and a big chair came and just hit her in the head 
[00:43:30]  and she went, oh, and then Vince comes running out.  And a bunch of wrestlers come running out to help her.  No?  Vince's wife is running for the Senate out of Connecticut.  And, uh...  And her opponent, Richard Blumenthal...  Oh, he's a little fibber, isn't he?  ...apologizes for misspeaking about serving in Vietnam.  Misspeaking.  Did he say misspeaking the same way Hillary said about misspeaking when it came to that  Bosnian thing?  Yes!  They're fucking lying!  Yes.  You don't miss...  You don't accidentally think you were in the NOM.  Yeah.  That's not something you just forget and go, oh, yeah, I wasn't. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  The word misspeak, this fucking, this soft way of saying I lied, that cop misspoke.  Right.  That was misspeaking.  Yeah, this is just horse shit.  I mean, this guy is a liar.  He lied to try to get support, I guess.  Well...  Is he Republican or Democrat?  Democrat.  Another Democrat lying about where they served.  But, again, I'm sure Republicans do it, too.  But he, uh... 
[00:44:30]  They absolutely do.  The word misspeak is what bugs me.  This guy got all kinds of deferments to stay out of the military during the Vietnam War.  He finally ran out of deferments.  Uh, and they...  Well, that's...  I'm just sorry.  Just watching the demolition of Giant Stadium there.  That's something.  Thermite paint!  Oh, shut up, you boob.  Yeah, he got all kinds of deferments to stay out of the military.  And then finally, when his deferments ran out, he joined the Marine Reserves. 
[00:45:00]  That, uh, had him stationed here in the United States the entire time.  Uh, and then he was talking about, uh, this collective we thing.  When talking about Vietnam vets serving in Vietnam.  Uh, when we came home, we were subject to being spit on and cursed at and called baby killer.  I mean, he used all the catchphrases, the little hot points.  All the catchphrases of the vet?  Of the Vietnam vets that actually were over there. 
[00:45:30]  All right, let's go back to 2008.  This is, uh, what Blumenthal said about Vietnam.  This nation has a way of sending young men and women to war and then forgetting them when they come home.  And that is unforgivable.  And I know that congressmen like Chris Shea is working very hard to change that situation.  We have learned something very important since the days that I served in Vietnam. 
[00:46:00]  Oh.  And you exemplify it.  Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it, Afghanistan or Iraq, we owe our military men and women unconditional support.  He said, you're a liar!  Goddamn liar!  That's a goddamn man!  I served in Vietnam.  He said, since the days I served in Vietnam. 
[00:46:30]  That is, that is a, a lie.  All she should do is play that and go, what's his name?  Oh, Blumen.  Blumen whatever.  Blumenreich.  Blumen whatever.  Blumenreich.  He lies.  Yeah.  Stop allowing, stop allowing them to say misspoke.  Misspoke.  That's not a misspoke.  That is a lie.  Well, he's going to try to explain himself.  Oh, good.  Let's at least hear him try to explain.  Yesterday he had this to say.  I'm proud of the veterans who are standing with me today.  They know that I attend dozens of military and veterans events every year. 
[00:47:00]  Can you pause that, please?  In times of peace, those are easy to show up to.  Anybody can attend those.  I'd be happy to go, too.  How about you attend the Battle of fucking Wei?  Yeah.  Where were you when Me Lai was happening?  The fucking, the Tet Offensive.  Were you in Da Nang, motherfucker?  Or were you in fucking Trenton?  We all, we could all go to the Veterans Day Parade, but when fucking the Tet Offensive  was having, you were sipping a fucking daiquiri somewhere. 
[00:47:30]  Your fucking feet up in Northern Toronto.  Northern Toronto.  Fucking, not just Toronto.  Fucker.  He was scared.  He had to make sure it was Northern Toronto.  That to me is, when Hillary said it, about being in Bosnia, but especially this, that  is so fucking disrespectful to guys that went to Vietnam.  Yes.  He continues.  Let's see if he can talk his way out of this.  Yeah.  Every year.  They know that I routinely describe my pride in having served in the United States Marine 
[00:48:00]  Corps Reserves during the Vietnam era.  Oh, God.  They're trying to back him, but that's got to just really annoy.  That, now he's trying to clear things up by saying it that way.  That's the way he should have said it initially.  Apparently, the clip that they got from, you know, where he does misspeak, apparently there's  a longer version of that video that had just been released, where he does actually say  in those words that he served during, before he actually makes the comment that he served 
[00:48:30]  in.  He says, in the Marine Corps, during the Vietnam era.  But then he says...  The Marine Corps later on says served in Vietnam.  Served in Vietnam.  Yeah, he kind of...  I think he probably said it the first time, looked around and said, anyone on to me?  All right, I could go deeper into this.  I think I could go deeper.  Warm.  That's...  That's the way the motor pool clerk laughs.  That's all he fucking was able to say, this pussy motherfucker. 
[00:49:00]  Let's do the whole goddamn hotel.  You ever see integrity come apart like that?  Yeah, you ever see a deferment come apart like that?  Denny's waitress, I bet she runs the whole show.  Can we hear the one time again, his fucking lie?  Because I want to hear if there's a way he said it where he could be saying that he's  saying something else, even though he's not.  Yeah.  Yeah, we just got the second half of yesterday's clip. 
[00:49:30]  Now, on a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service.  Misspoken.  And I regret that.  Oh.  And I take full responsibility.  Of course you do.  But I will not allow...  You all said it.  You said it, asshole.  What won't he allow himself to go to Vietnam?  I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words...  Like I and Vietnam?  Non-record of service to our country. 
[00:50:00]  Fuck yeah.  This fucking prick.  What an asshole.  This fucking prick.  Making it look like people are unpatriotic to question when he lied about going to Vietnam.  That's a big misplaced word.  Exactly.  Here's the original clip again.  This nation has a way of sending young men and women to war and then forgetting them when  they come home.  And that is unforgivable. 
[00:50:30]  And I know that a congressman like Chris Shays are working very hard to change that situation.  We have learned something very important since the days that I served in Vietnam.  And you exemplify it.  Whatever we think about the war...  We have learned some very important...  Whatever we call it, Afghanistan, Iraq, we owe our military men and women unconditional  support.  See, I was wondering if there was a way he could have spun that where he put the commas 
[00:51:00]  in the wrong place.  Yeah, yeah.  He wanted people to say that.  Yeah, that's true.  He didn't.  Since the days that I served.  And he even said like the days that I served in Vietnam.  In Vietnam.  In Vietnam, yeah.  I just served in general.  That's right.  During a war.  Whatever.  They're all full of shit.  He should have actually gone to Vietnam.  Um, like he should go now and get a job in a restaurant and serve somebody and then leave.  That way he could say he served in Vietnam.  I'm just trying to help him out. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  You know what annoyed McCain must be though?  The guy like McCain who really fucking served.  Served?  The guy got fucking beaten.  Every bone in his body broken by those little bastards.  He got the ferments to come back to the U.S. from the Vietnamese.  He fucking could have left and he stayed.  Yes.  Yeah.  He's a ballsy dude.  He stayed with his guys.  Why don't we take a break because we got a lot to do today.  Wow.  Laszlo's coming in to talk about, uh...  Red Dead Redemption.  Red Dead Redemption. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  Right, right, right, right.  I got quite a few little things on Twitter and stuff saying people heard my character.  I guess the main character interacts with my guy at some point.  Very cool.  The gunsmith.  I start talking about the Second Amendment and stuff to the guy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I get all rambunctious.  And then someone said, it's great.  It sounds like a more tamed down Yosemite Sam.  Oh, nice.  I want to play this one.  I definitely want to play this game. 
[00:52:30]  That was definitely one of the hard things about doing the, I guess, the voicing for this game.  Because it's not like GTA where you could just talk and be like a regular person in the street.  Like, you had to not only be Old West, but like Chicago.  Yeah.  Like Midwest, Old West.  You gotta try to sound like the Old West.  It's like two different...  Yeah, sure.  It's like you try to do two different, you know, things at once.  I want to find out...  I want to find out today what I was supposed to be in this game.  What your lines were supposed to be?  Yeah, because I blew off another thing.  I gotta stop blowing stuff off. 
[00:53:00]  The reviews are just ridiculous.  I know, it's amazing.  This game looks like it's gonna just...  9.5s and 10s on all of the fucking publications that matter.  That's great.  This is IGN.  IGN has given, and that's one of the more...  And we're setting up the game in studio so we can check out shit?  Yep.  Is he bringing his game guy in?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, wow.  We're gonna have fun with Lazlo today.  And he'll talk about other tech things as well.  What is IGN's rating for this?  A 9.7.  9.7, that's big.  Wow, that's huge.  Do you give out a lot of 9.7s?  And that's, I mean...  Do they give out a lot of 9.7s?  Not really.  I mean, you know, it's gotta be a pretty decent game to score this high. 
[00:53:30]  I'll play that.  We're gonna take a break.  We got Bret Michaels on Oprah.  I think we should listen to some of that audio today.  Uh-oh.  Bret Michaels should get that up off Oprah because it's gonna start hurting her.  Oh, Chip.  Oh, on Oprah.  I got you, Chip.  And we also have Kim Cattrall because the Sex and the City movie's about to hit theaters.  We have Kim Cattrall. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, I bet she's saucy.  She doesn't like the term cougar.  This will be a...  If the pelt fits.  Exactly.  Ugh.  Shut up.  Have you seen the commercials for the Sex and the City movie?  How could I miss them?  They're on camels and...  Oh, they just love it.  Under them.  Under them.  Yeah, Samantha's underneath it sucking one off.  She's spitting cum like the camel spits.  Blech.  Doing the fucking horse gag with a camel. 
[00:54:30]  Blech.  Don't knock it till you've tried it.  And one of the dumb entertainment shows said that Sarah Jessica Parker had like 40-something  costume changes in the movie.  Did she?  I guess that was a big deal.  Different colored saddles.  So we got Kim Cattrall talking about the term cougar and why she doesn't like it.  Oh, great.  I can't wait.  Trust me.  You're going to want to stick around for that.  Lots of radio to do.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude. 
[00:55:00]  Joe Cocker is 66 today.  I thought he was older.  No kidding.  I think it's the alcohol.  Yeah.  I interviewed him when I was at BAB.  He came in.  He came in with no shoes or socks on.  This is a true story.  I just remember this.  I forgot all about this.  Dirty feet. 
[00:55:30]  Of course.  Disheveled.  With a six-pack.  I forgot what the six-pack was.  That's how he showed up for the interview.  Yeah, he was kind of known for that.  Yeah.  Well, he is.  He's still alive.  So, he's 66 today.  Hmm.  And Cher is 64.  Wow.  Wow.  Cher is 64?  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Unbelievable.  That is 64, and you got to deal with that fucking mess daughter turning into a man. 
[00:56:00]  Like, at 64, you should just be on cruise.  Cruise control.  And not dealing with anything?  No, not have to deal with the fact that your daughter wants to fucking be a man.  I don't think Cher is really dealing with it, though.  No.  I think she's kind of stayed in the background with the whole Chaz Bono thing.  Chaz Bono.  What's her male name?  Chaz?  Yeah, Chaz.  And her female name was Chastity.  So, now she just goes by Chaz.  Chaz Bono.  And she's been on hormone treatments for, I don't know, six months by now. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  And there's no changes.  No.  Her tits look like big man boobs.  They're fucking...  I can't wait to see the beard, though.  The beard is something...  Every woman that turns into a man has to grow the beard to reinforce that manliness thing.  I told the story of the kid that I saw walking in my neighborhood fully dressed as a woman.  Did I tell that story on the show?  No.  And I don't understand these people that feel like, well, they have to be a female. 
[00:57:00]  This kid didn't...  Wasn't close to a sex change.  And I think he was only about 18, 19 years old.  He had kind of curly hair.  He was chubby.  And he had ribbons in his curly hair.  And then he dressed like an old school woman from the 50s.  Like, why do they have to go with the old school outfits?  I love when they do that.  They just pluck a bit of history out and dress like no one dresses.  Really strange.  And he had like old heels that... 
[00:57:30]  You would see like Lucille Ball wear or something.  You know what I mean?  A little I love Lucy hat tacked to the side of his head.  Yeah.  Might as well have been.  I mean, like he stepped out of the 50s.  The early 50s.  And then I continue walking down the sidewalk.  And then there's women that are dressed like men, really.  Because they got jeans on, shoes.  Yeah.  You know, they're not really that...  Women aren't really that feminine anymore to begin with.  Most of them.  Oh, God.  What is that?  That's...  That's... 
[00:58:00]  What is that, Danny?  Was that a woman and then became a man that's got like kind of a beard growing there?  I don't know.  Bearded women.  Bearded women.  There's a website dedicated to bearded women?  Ew.  That is really fucking...  Wow.  Look at that.  It's just not very sexy.  What's the size?  Unfuckable.com?  They only have two pictures on the whole site?  Yeah.  They're very hard to come by.  They got to step it up a little bit.  There is more. 
[00:58:30]  We got to see more pictures of bearded women.  Bearded women.  Come on.  That just looks like fucking...  The same person with a bunch of YouTube videos.  It's like any better.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing, lady?  Well, if you grow the hair, what are they supposed to do?  Shave it.  It grows back.  Got the electrolysis.  Shave it again.  And then it grows back again.  Well, it's a process men go through.  So let them do it.  What's the option?  Fucking Fu Manchu? 
[00:59:00]  It's like geezer butler.  It's fucking horrible.  Yeah, I don't understand the women with just a few hairs on their chin that are a little too long.  Do you know how easy that is to take care of?  And you know they're there.  Don't tell me you just don't know.  Yeah.  All right.  Speaking of pigs, Kim Cattrall.  Oh, God.  This Sex and the City movie.  We got to take a field trip and go see this dumb movie.  We said that with the last one, didn't we?  We really have to.  I haven't even seen the last one on any medium whatsoever. 
[00:59:30]  Who likes these movies?  Who likes these movies?  I don't know.  Women?  Are that desperate for entertainment?  It has to be women and I would guess gay guys, right?  Yeah.  Are straight guys going to see these movies, these Sex and the City movies?  I'm going to see Rochelle Rochelle.  What?  Rochelle.  Seinfeld.  Oh.  God damn it.  I'll just keep making references.  Someone out there is getting them.  Of course.  I know.  I really got to watch Seinfeld.  I can't stop watching them.  Now that's been off the air.  How many years? 
[01:00:00]  15 at this point, maybe?  So this is what Kim Cattrall said because all the ladies are doing their interviews leading  up to the big premiere of Sex and the City.  Oh boy.  Those girls, let me tell you, they are sassy, full of fucking spunk and life and just the  envy of every woman out there, I think.  That's right.  Oh, if more people could just have friends and be like the girls from Sex and the City.  What a great place this would be. 
[01:00:30]  You know what's sex?  Having fun, open.  Sex in the city?  Sex in the city?  Or is it Sex in the City?  Now I'm confused.  It's called A Bucket of Shit.  A Bucket of Shit.  Who's your favorite, Ed?  Oh, come on.  Stop it.  Samantha.  Samantha's your favorite?  She is my favorite.  And I base favorite on who I hate the most.  You know, I met her once and she was really, really nice.  Don't say it.  No, not hot or any of that crap, but she couldn't have been nicer. 
[01:01:00]  I saw her on the streets with that fruit comedian.  Who?  Mario?  Yeah.  Mario.  Mario can't talk.  Mario.  Who always wanted to be famous desperately.  And all right, you're famous now.  Good for you.  He used to do our show all the time.  All right.  Here's what Kim Cattrall said yesterday in an interview.  You know, I really take umbrage to the code cougar.  Do you take umbrage to that?  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Where's um?  It's got to, because you got to take the bridge.  It's um.  Oh, fuck.  There it is.  Oops.  Bridge closed.  Accident.  I think that cougar has a negative connotation.  And I don't see anything negative about Samantha and sexuality and sensuality.  Holy shit.  Is she delusional?  What a baby. 
[01:02:00]  Wait, what?  She says being called a cougar is very negative.  It's negative?  And she doesn't see that in her character in Sex and the City.  What?  Exactly.  Let me play that again.  Oh, this is her calling.  Did you guys hear that, or was that me?  Sometimes I just hear that sound.  It's in my head.  Yeah.  That's how I know it's time to go to the bathroom.  I don't think that's my mother.  All right.  Yeah, mine's off.  Everyone set?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:02:30]  I don't see anything negative about Samantha and sexuality and sensuality and choice.  I don't think that she stands or sits in bars waiting for young men to prey on.  And I think that's something that a lot of people who are uncomfortable with strong women have labeled her.  I was asked recently by a significant magazine for women over 40 to pose with a cougar.  And I refused to do it because I felt it was insulting.  No wound magazine?  I took away the cover because I refused to do so.  Oh, God.  My copy of Dried Ovaries magazine. 
[01:03:00]  What a baby.  Get a hold of yourself.  And she's basically saying that all cougars just sit at a bar waiting?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I think the cougars are doing quite well for themselves.  She was saying cougars don't.  And her character doesn't just sit there waiting to prey on young men.  Right.  But every fucking clip they ever play to advertise this whore character is her making fuck jokes, talking about how she fucked last night, how she grabbed some fucking young guy and fucked him. 
[01:03:30]  So what does she want?  And isn't she the pursuer usually?  Yes.  So what is she talking about?  She's fucking delusional.  Yeah.  She's trying to.  I think she's trying to spin this into something that it isn't.  Oh, what a wreck.  It's a dumb movie.  Shut up.  You're a dumb old broad having a lot of sex.  With her square tits.  Get a hold of yourself.  Are they square?  Oh, God.  If you punch up a picture of Kim Cattrall's nude tits, dude, they're square. 
[01:04:00]  They're not square.  I swear to you, she has square tits.  Let's take a look.  The bottom is flat and the sides are flattened.  Why do you think Sarah Jessica Parker never was topless in, whoa.  Look at her square tits.  She has horrible tits.  Who is that?  That's Kim Cattrall.  Why is she holding two shoe boxes?  The person we're talking about.  The shoe boxes.  Look like SpongeBob SquarePants eyes.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Jesus.  It's just not sexy.  No.  Does any guy find her sexy?  Like, all right, there are guys that would be like, yeah, I'd fuck her, but does anyone  find her sexy?  No.  Not at all.  She looks like her pussy smells from a yeast infection or something.  Yeah?  Yeah.  There's nothing growing down there.  No yeast, no nothing.  Instead of cleavage, she has like, what, bones it looks like?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  In between her boobs.  That's good.  Her sternum is fucking, looks like the top of a Klingon head.  Right, it does.  That's what she has in between those two.  God, I met her though.  She couldn't have been nicer.  Really?  Yeah.  Now, what is that picture?  Her nude again.  What is she doing?  Why is she next to women that you would fuck?  Why would you do that?  Oh, Nick in Maryland.  We're trying to figure out what this sequel is all about.  Nick?  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:05:30]  So, okay.  The first time that this movie came out, Jimmy had all those extra, you know, plots.  And I wanted to come up with more because I saw a trailer where they are in like, I think  it's-  Abu Dhabi!  Is it?  Yeah.  They're in a desert on camels.  I remember seeing that.  Yeah.  And Jimmy had that plot line where they made like a factory and then they got killed by  like an Arab sheik.  All right.  Do you have a plot for the new movie?  I already-  Because I remember for the first one, it was very strange because basically all the main 
[01:06:00]  characters were killed within the first two minutes of the film.  Oh, yeah.  They were.  Yes.  The best possible.  They were.  Can we find that?  Can we find Jimmy's plot of the first Sex and the City movie?  Oh, fantastic.  Because it was a fantastic idea, yeah.  Do you have one, Nick?  Because the thought of the fans-  Oh, I don't.  I just figured Jimmy would probably-  I did one for this one already, but I don't remember exactly what it was.  It was the other day.  Yeah.  The thought of the fans going to the movie and getting all excited, hearing the music,  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, 
[01:06:30]  and then the credits roll, and then the opening scene happens, and the entire cast  is gruesomely killed, and then the storyline has nothing to do.  All I ever wanted to see was just that one with just the whole spaceship thing, and how  it was like, not the O-Ring, Dan.  Oh, right.  I forgot about that shit.  The O-Ring.  Linger longer, Nick.  I was just thinking O-Ring, yeah.  I forgot about that.  It was a-  Yeah, they were in space. 
[01:07:00]  Yep.  That was the best possible way.  There was a few of them.  You're right.  We're going to have to dig them up from the first movie so we could get some-  Jimmy, love you.  Ant, you're amazing.  Opie, you're an ass, but I love you.  I like the idea-  I kind of liked my compliment.  Thank you.  I like the idea of them going to Abu Dhabi.  Yeah.  And like, as the credits roll, they're like on the plane, like laughing and like smiling,  but then you realize that's a flashback.  Oh.  And it goes to them-  I'm very lost.  Yeah, you realize that they've been arrested as suspected lesbians in an Arabic country. 
[01:07:30]  Ah, four girls traveling like that.  Yes.  And they're all sentenced to 27 years.  So the whole film is just about their attorneys trying to get the funding to fight their appeal.  And they'll occasionally reference them.  And one of them has their throat cut in jail by an angry guard, but they just tell you.  You don't see it, right?  What's Sarah and Jessica Parker?  Oh, uh.  I, uh.  I just want to share.  Or they'll say-  Who?  Carrie.  They'll say where?  Fuck it!  The one the guy will go, where is it? 
[01:08:00]  It's Kenny.  And the other guy will just put his hands like-  Oh, do that.  Across his throat.  Like, yeah, like she was slaughtered like an animal.  Do you think that would wreck the franchise that is Sex and the City?  Because it was- it's not about- they would literally be maybe the first five minutes.  You'll only get the fucking credit.  Like that shit song is with them on the plane to Abu Dhabi.  And they're just- you know, Samantha's got like a martini glass-  Yeah.  Because they're flying first class.  She's like, I can't wait to get there and meet some of the uncut men.  And then- and they land.  Are they arrested immediately? 
[01:08:30]  Immediately.  That's a flashback.  Or you just hear, like, it's shot really, like, with choppy footage.  Like, lesbian, anti-God, just something like that.  And then, boom, they're in jail.  What happened?  And then the whole thing is about their attorneys.  Their attorneys.  They introduce the attorney.  He walks in and he goes, I'm going to see what I can do.  And then he walks out and you don't see them again.  And it's all about him.  And it's all subtitled.  So they're actually speaking Arabic.  It's all subtitled.  You have to force all the fans to actually read for an hour and a half. 
[01:09:00]  You have to read this.  And it's a lot of legal jargon.  And a lot of little motions being made.  Is there a lot of files going back and forth between the attorneys?  Yes, lots of files and all kinds of legalese.  Oh, my God.  Yes, that would be such a bomb.  Do you know how much people would hate that?  Oh, would they be angry?  Like, they would think, all right, this is weird.  But then, like, ten minutes into it, like, when this guy, the whole movie,  is this guy with his briefcase in the car screaming in his cell phone at his wife  about something that had no connection to the movie? 
[01:09:30]  I mean, he'd realize they're trying to develop other characters to spin off his film.  He's trying to make a motion.  Yeah.  And it's not being accepted by the court.  Oh, would that just ruin everything for those poor people?  That would be so great.  Jason in Indiana writes, Sponge Kim square tits, Anthony.  Yes.  And also, someone is saying, she was in Time is not my friend magazine.  That's bred in North Carolina.  Ah, is that what she was reading?  Yeah.  Well, people have plots now.  Let's say hi to David in Indiana.  David? 
[01:10:00]  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  David?  Congrats, Obi, on the young one.  Thank you.  I had a plot line where I thought it might be neat if when the plane lands, it crashes,  and all four of them are severely burned, and the rest of the movie is them prostituting  themselves to raise money to help pay for skin grafts, and then whenever Samantha would  get fucked, her burn victim wig would fall off, and it would just be an awkward situation. 
[01:10:30]  Very awkward, right.  Oh, I like that.  A little too much of them in it, though.  I agree.  I like the idea of the burn victim.  Yeah.  But I think the other three should be killed in a Cessna crash, and what happened is the  fuselage, she should be thrown from the fuselage with gas all over her, and then as she catches  fire, that's what the movie opens, with just like the scene from a distance in a field smoldering,  and you realize it's her body, and they show her thin lips opening, so she's in bandages 
[01:11:00]  the whole film.  Yeah.  That's an even better idea, Jimmy.  Yeah, because three of them are dead, so you don't have to concentrate on them, and  you don't even know which one is alive, because they can't identify her.  Right.  Will we at least find out at the end?  Because that'll keep people to the end of the film, at least, to see who survived the  plane crash.  Yes, through dental records.  Whose lips they are.  They have to go through dental records, so half the film is about the dentist and the  problem he's having with his equipment.  Oh.  Because his computer keeps crashing?  Yeah.  And the dental records are on the computer? 
[01:11:30]  He can't identify it, and he's getting involved in a litigation with a company that sold him  his identification equipment.  I would like for them to perhaps get off the airplane at Abu Dhabi, and the second they  step into the terminal building, someone yells, Allah Akbar, pulls the fucking handle, a huge  explosion happens.  All of them, except the red-headed dyke girl, is dead.  But her arms and legs have been blown off, and she's in this rehabilitation center, but  she's only like a very peripheral character.  The story is about this rehabilitation doctor, and how he helps people cope with the loss 
[01:12:00]  of limbs.  And they don't tell anybody, but it's Robin Williams as Patch Adams, and he comes in wearing  like a funny nose.  Bringing back his role.  And he uses her torso to make people laugh.  Yes.  He comes in and taunts her every day by coming around the doorway with his knees in his shoes  like he's short, and with no arms.  Just gloves hanging out of his short sleeves.  And he makes little quips like, this will be handy. 
[01:12:30]  Well, why can't you get a leg up?  Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  Whoops.  Maybe the rest of the movie is them getting a new arm for her.  Yeah, yeah.  And the problems they're having getting that arm and getting it to work properly before  they actually...  Getting an arm that could diddle a pussy.  Because she's a Lisbo.  Before they can actually give it to her.  The whole movie's just in a fucking arm factory.  So many great stories.  But they can't get Robin Williams.  They have to use Robert Williams, just some novice actor from Connecticut who has a fake  beard. 
[01:13:00]  Hey, Kevin in North Carolina.  Patch Arnold, he calls himself.  Kevin has a great one.  Kevin.  You know, I think this is tailor-made for Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.  Can you imagine?  Oh, okay.  You know?  Yeah, right on.  They end up at the Titty Twister, where they're forced to dance and become vampires.  All the vampires could attack, and then when they get to Kim Cintrall, they're like,  eh, you know what?  Not so much.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  We got more plots coming in.  We got John in Alabama.  We're trying to figure out the plot of the Sex Inn or Sex and the City, the sequel there. 
[01:13:30]  Alabama, ma'am.  What do you got, John?  I got a good one.  Kim Cattrall, they brainwash her.  She comes back to the United States, sticks about 10 sticks of dynamite in her pussy and  blows up Times Square.  Well, okay.  The Manchurian cuntinate.  I like the idea, but we got to throw it through the Jim Norton filter, because I'm thinking  that she's going to be in the movie too long.  We don't want him in the movie for more than, what, five minutes, Jimmy? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, but I mean, I don't mind it if it's really about her pussy getting blown out.  I do kind of like that.  Like, she's blackmailed or brainwashed into doing it.  Brainwashed, yeah.  And then the rest of the movie is all about the group that brainwashed her.  But I don't, these plots are too busy.  There's too much happening.  Yeah.  I like a good technical courtroom drama around, like, for instance, they're all killed in  the plane crash.  Look, fuck them.  Okay.  All of them go down, the wingtip hits the runway, and the plane flips, and then the entire 
[01:14:30]  film is about the lawsuit surrounding the fucking faulty wing flap.  I like that.  I like the fact that Boeing is suing the company that made the wing flap.  Right, with a lot of technical jargon about the wings and the maintenance schedule of the  plane.  I want to see all those records on the film.  That would be fantastic.  I like that one.  Well, we got Mongo the trucker.  Mongo. 
[01:15:00]  Okay, well, take your theory, Jimmy, of they're all killed, like, in the first five minutes.  And then the whole movie is about this old coroner who has an Asian helper with a pension for  necrophilia.  Oh, okay.  It turns into a Quincy movie.  It's actually all about making a Quincy movie.  Yes.  Look at the size of a vagina, Sam.  This winter coat stored in it.  That's awesome.  Well, I would, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Well, one more.  I like that idea.  One more.  One more.  And then we'll move on.  Mike in Green Bay.  All right.  How about Mr. Big gets arrested for not wiping his ass with his hands?  And they dress up in an open-ended camel suit with camel face in the front and dried up  front and the back.  And they die of heat, dehydration, crossing the desert.  A little too much.  Too much.  I like the idea that it's...  No, no, no.  He's basically saying that Sarah Jessica Parker would play the part of the camel head.  The camel? 
[01:16:00]  So I kind of like that.  The head part.  You know, it's one of those suits where all four of them in.  And then Kim Cattrall's ass up in the air would look like a dried out camel asshole.  I probably would.  No, I like the idea that the movie's about Mr. Big, but then you realize that they're  only calling him that because of his tumor.  He has a big tumor at the base of his spine.  See, that's different.  That isn't Mr. Big.  That isn't fun either.  No, not at all.  And it's just the tragedy of him going through all kinds of treatment.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  And the only reference to her is her occasionally on the phone.  And when he says to the doctors, look, can you guys leave?  I've got to call the horse.  Let's say hi to Tom in Tallahassee.  Tom.  Hey.  You're out, Tom.  I've got an idea that going with the previews that they have, Mr. Big finds out that Kerry  was cheating, so he has the four of them classify as enemy combatants. 
[01:17:00]  Ah.  So then they get water tabled for the whole beginning of the movie.  Then when they realize their mistake, they realize they just have to dispose their bodies  from the desert somewhere.  Well, what about a good old-fashioned waterboarding for the entire movie?  Or are they in the film too long?  Too much.  Too much.  Then you care about their plight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got to go right away.  Right away, right?  Yeah.  It's good for the franchise?  Absolutely.  Okay.  Just go.  You'll just see glittery jewelry fucking explode somewhere. 
[01:17:30]  Severed limbs.  A nice Sarah Jessica Parker fucking leg here.  That horse Samantha head laying there.  What a horse shit movie this is going to be.  But the women are going to fucking love it.  Oh, they flock to this crap.  We got that production piece you were talking about?  We have a Sex and the City production piece that revolves around what Jimmy said about the  first movie that came out.  Check this out.  We're staying.  We're staying.  And we're not doing a break.  We're just playing this and coming right back. 
[01:18:00]  It's the full-length Sex and the City movie you've all been waiting for.  The ultimate single gal, Carrie Bradshaw, will be married to John James Preston come fall.  No, not that one.  That one fucking sucks.  She's about to marry Mr. Big.  Yeah.  All four of them are in the SUV on the way to the church.  But real life always has a twist.  And a dump truck barrels through a red light.  And kills them all. 
[01:18:30]  We've got a problem.  And all of a sudden, the next thing you see is like four bodies in the street with white  sheets over and the credits start rolling.  Oh, and a picture is proudly presents Sex and the City, the everyone dies version.  Watch and laugh your ass off as the four main characters get hit by a truck and get spread  like mulch all over the streets of New York City.  Coming to a theater near you.  Oh, fuck.  That's good, man.  That's perfect.  The beginning is just them being plowed over by a dump truck. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, God.  She was almost hot when she was younger, this Sarah Jessica Parker.  Almost hot, I call it.  L.A. Story.  Almost hot.  She was hot and you're going with hot?  I say almost hot.  Yeah, I remember watching that movie like a very long time ago and thinking that she  was really cute.  Wasn't she on roller skates or something in that movie?  She played like a ditz, just some ditzy chick.  What happened?  I didn't say nothing.  I didn't know she was in a French movie, Lost Story. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, it's L.A. Story.  Shit.  Is that her from Lost Story?  No, it's even earlier than that.  This is Girls Just Want to Have Fun, 85.  But here, I'll pull up some L.A. Story.  Girls Want to Have Fun.  Who the fuck was in that movie?  I don't remember that movie.  Oh, I bet I could tell you what the opening song was, though.  Nothing better than a movie based on a song.  See, she's almost hot in L.A. Story.  Yeah.  Like, almost.  Yeah, well, she...  She falls just short of being hot. 
[01:20:00]  She was looking almost hot in movies in the 80s.  There's a problem in 2010.  True.  She was okay.  I mean, I wouldn't classify her as hot.  Just, yeah, she was okay.  She had youth on her side.  I mean, this is almost 20 years ago already.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't mind a chubby girl if she's young.  Oh, I'm going to just differ with that.  A middle-aged girl that's chubby, that's rough.  I don't like chubby girls on principle.  But a young chub, not bad.  I thought she was good in Ed Wood, like her performance. 
[01:20:30]  She wasn't hot or anything.  Who was she in Ed Wood?  She was Ed Wood's chick.  Holy shit.  Yeah, she was Ed Wood's chick.  The first chick, yeah.  Holy shit, I forgot all about that.  I did not know that.  Yeah.  I got to fucking watch Ed Wood again.  Ed Wood rules.  Yeah, it sure does.  Oh, it's great.  And that scene, that little exchange that they have in the hallway.  Oh, yeah.  Hi, Alice.  You know, whatever it is.  Hi.  Well, what are you doing?  If you see the original Ed Wood, they just basically did that scene out of the original  Ed Wood movie verbatim.  Yeah, it's perfect.  The scene is perfect, their acting is perfect, it's just exactly the scene. 
[01:21:00]  Acting, is that what you were calling it?  It is so bad.  Well, in the movie Ed Wood.  Yeah.  Can you get an Ed Wood clip on YouTube?  Absolutely.  Really, his films really were that bad.  Like real Ed Wood?  Oh, the real Ed Wood.  Not the movie, but the real Ed Wood.  We're going to do this, though.  We're going to take another break because we've got to get ready for Ian Halpern and we've  got to get ready for Laszlo.  So if we take a break now, we can do some other material and then we set up nice for Ian  Halpern.  His Highness is checking in today.  He's checking in.  And we've got to yell at him again.  He keeps giving us these blind items where we could be superstars around the world. 
[01:21:30]  Because he hinted that Matt Lauer was having an affair, even though Matt Lauer is vehemently  denying it.  But that's who Ian Halpern was hinting was having an affair.  Remember he said TV host?  Yes.  But I thought it was Larry King.  No, this was after Larry King.  Oh.  And he has a blind item today, too.  He's got to give us something a little more than that, a little substance.  So we get our names out there to the world.  So it does.  We'll do the Ed Wood clip. 
[01:22:00]  What's going on with you, Jimmy?  I have a few gigs coming up.  As everybody knows, July 2nd and 3rd, I'll be at the Borgata.  No way!  I haven't mentioned it yet.  I've kind of kept it under my hat.  Yeah.  And this, I think the 28th or whatever this month, I'll be in Seattle on that Friday.  That would be next weekend.  Next Friday, right.  Seattle at the, whatever theater it is, I forget.  My brain just said, shoebox at the market, but it just sounds stupid when it yells out loud. 
[01:22:30]  And then I have Caroline's June 3 through 6.  A lot of dates to see Jimmy Norton.  Very good.  If you are so inclined.  So we wake up this morning to find out that oil is still pouring into the Gulf, right?  Yes, but thank God.  But Kevin Costner's to the rescue.  Thank God for scientist Kevin Costner.  So now we're going with a movie star to figure out the problem, right?  A guy that...  Did you see Waterworld? 
[01:23:00]  I saw Waterworld.  All right, well, he dealt with a giant tanker full of oil and a crazy madman and the smokers  and all that.  So he's the guy to get.  So we're that desperate, so we're getting the guy that starred in Waterworld to try to  figure out...  Did you see the Postman?  No, because it was the same movie.  Only on land.  Right, exactly.  It was Waterworld on land.  It was Dirtland.  I'm not a fan of...  Dirtland.  It was...  Blank on...  Yes.  Blank.  Did you see The Bodyguard? 
[01:23:30]  He protects people.  Yeah, that was just like Waterworld, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, very, very...  Yeah.  Think about it.  Did you see Kyle Ripken Jr.'s life?  Just like Waterworld.  What?  They're all just like Waterworld.  Kyle Ripken Jr.'s life.  Boy, did I full-paw with that one when we were interviewing him.  No, you were right to ask it, though.  I have no idea.  It was like, look, hey, you were nice about it.  We didn't harp on it.  We gave him a chance to explain it nicely, and we moved on.  He dances with wolves. 
[01:24:00]  It was Waterworld.  On horses.  With Indians and on horses.  Yeah.  It was the same time.  Yes.  They all go back to Waterworld.  Same thing.  So why are they thinking, because the guy was in Waterworld, that he could solve the fucking  oil spill problem?  Because it's in the water.  Duh.  How far are we going to take this?  What, he's an inventor or something, this guy?  He does everything.  No.  Does he feel the dreams?  There's Waterworld in a cornfield. 
[01:24:30]  With baseball.  You're not going to trick me, man.  I know.  You're not going to trick me.  It seems Kevin Costner has invented a technique for taking a ship and just driving it through  the oil.  You drive it through, and it sucks up all the oil and water, and then through some kind  of, I don't know, magic, water spits out of the ship, and the oil stays in the ship. 
[01:25:00]  What?  It's Kevin Costner.  It's amazing.  You ever see Tin Cup?  Waterworld?  Waterworld on a golf course.  A golf course.  Exactly.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Are we living in the future?  We're living in Kevin Costner's future.  Who knows if it works?  It could be a bunch of bunk.  Kevin Costner make bunk?  I don't think so.  He makes long movies.  The problem is, though, that the thing that sucks up the water, he hasn't perfected it. 
[01:25:30]  It's the size of something that holds confectionary sugar.  Confectionary sugar.  That's it?  Yes.  They're afraid that he predicts it's going to take 47 years to clean up the spill.  See, but like his movies, it will take a long time, because his movies are very long.  You ever see 3,000 Miles to Graceland?  Elvis on water?  This water world.  With Elvis Presley.  With sideburns.  Yes.  Exactly.  Bit's running out of steam. 
[01:26:00]  But is he really an inventor?  Huh?  Really?  Yes.  He's actually done this, made this.  He's marketed it.  And I believe BP, British Petroleum, is giving him upwards of $24 million to deploy this system to...  Is it ready to go?  ...fix this shit up.  Yeah, he's been sitting on this, I guess.  Wow, really?  Yes!  And the oil just continues to spill out from the ocean floor? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I think I saw the latest video.  Now they got a video so we can just watch how it's destroying our waters.  Tar balls are washing up.  I know, that's terrific.  On Florida.  Tar balls.  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  What?  What did I do?  That was an alert for people in Florida.  Don't swim.  Yeah.  There's tar balls in the water.  Watch that.  Yeah, it's got caught up in the Gulf Stream. 
[01:27:00]  And now it's kind of working its way around the Keys and the East Coast of Florida.  Is BP at least taking responsibility?  Well, they're definitely...  It's no way they can just say, I don't know who did it.  But I like when people take responsibility and you go, oh, they're taking responsibility.  Okay, that's good.  Everything's good now.  Yeah, they're taking responsibility.  But what does that mean in the end?  Do we get to hang them?  No, it's their problem.  It's their problem?  Yeah.  But Kevin Costner to the rescue. 
[01:27:30]  Kevin Costner.  $24 million ocean cleaning invention will be approved and they're going to try to clean up the ocean with this thing.  Which means they're completely out of ideas.  Of course.  It is fantastic, though, that they're doing this.  Hmm.  Yeah.  And actually, John Travolta has an idea, too.  He's going to fly his plane, one of his planes over, and then just stick his ass out and pick up all the oil with his giant asshole. 
[01:28:00]  No.  What he's going to do is they're going to filter it all through his toupee.  And wring it out over and over again.  Yeah, let's just sign up and help out.  Yeah, I think I could assist.  Yeah, they're just going to drag Travolta's wig through the fucking water.  And they're going to filter all the oil into it.  We've got to go to Randall because he's going to debunk the Kevin Costner thing.  Randall.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just thought it was funny because there's a YouTube video of a whole bunch of rednecks that have these big things of hay that are in this tube. 
[01:28:30]  And all you do is soak them up and it soaks up all the oil and it costs nothing.  So rednecks are doing the same thing that Costner's doing for nothing.  For nothing.  And they won't even talk to these guys.  Well, something tells me that a little hay in your fucking, oh, God.  A little hay in a tube isn't going to be able to filter out that much oil.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But, I mean, it's just, it's something. 
[01:29:00]  Then what do you do with the hay?  Well, you know, it's in a tube, a mesh tube, and you just fill it with hay and it soaks up all the oil and leaves the water.  And then you just pull the tubes out and you burn them.  You're no Kevin Costner, Randall.  And we're learning it's not actually Kevin Costner.  Cheryl, give us some knowledge.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  Good, Cheryl.  It's his brother.  It's not him.  Ted Costner? 
[01:29:30]  Yes.  Kevin Costner's brother.  I don't know his name.  It's Ted.  My brother did Waterworld.  I wrote that film.  I helped him.  Ted Costner, is this your invention?  It certainly is.  It's going to take all the oil and it's going to keep the water on the ship and put the oil back in and it's pure as full.  No, no, no.  We want the opposite.  Yes, no, it's not.  They were tired.  They said that the oil was coming off the animals too easily.  And they needed a purer form of oil.  No, I don't think that's the Ted Costner.  The seals were complaining. 
[01:30:00]  They were cold and the oil was making them warm.  We need your help.  What's your invention?  How long is it going to take to clean up this mess?  My invention is going to take approximately 15 minutes to clean up the mess.  15 minutes.  Yes, it's a ship that's 3,000 miles wide and 2,000 miles long and four feet high.  And you have this built already, this ship?  I certainly don't.  I need to start gathering materials.  Oh, it's not even built yet.  Oh, so when the ship is built, how long is the ship going to take to be built?  Probably a long time, Gregory, since I haven't hired any workers yet. 
[01:30:30]  So it's 15 minutes once it's done.  Yes, my facility's in Arizona and they're arresting all my employees.  And that's nowhere near water.  That's a bad place for you.  Yeah, how are you going to get the ship in the water from Arizona?  I haven't thought that through yet, Gregory.  A bunch of trucks.  A bunch of trucks.  Maybe you could just roll it into the water slowly and surely.  Probably end over end, yes.  But these damn animals are not getting enough oil on them, but it's a sin. 
[01:31:00]  It really is sad when you see a duck and he's coated with oil, but there's some parts of him that don't have oil on them.  It bothers me so much.  That poor little animal just wants oil all over his fur and wings.  And it's only on half of them in his face.  He just looks silly.  And all of these animal haters putting parmoliv on these poor things and removing the oil.  Yes, they use parmoliv.  They certainly do.  With their dirty gloves.  Wow, that guy's in despair as he holds up a... 
[01:31:30]  Look at that lucky duck.  It's got oil from head to toe.  All over his beak.  He must be toasty.  I don't know if he's a lucky one.  It doesn't seem that lucky at all.  He needs some parmoliv.  He needs parmoliv.  He does not need parmoliv.  He needs to be thrown back in before the oil drips off him.  Goddamn.  So it's Kevin Costner's...  I know Kevin Costner has two other people involved in this. 
[01:32:00]  I don't know if Kevin Costner was doing all the financial backing or whatever.  He financed it.  His brother's a scientist.  Okay, he financed it.  Oh, so he's like the Dave Thomas.  He doesn't really actually make the burgers.  He spent $24 million on it.  And he did Waterworld.  So he knows that was the Exxon Valdez in Waterworld.  That's where he got the idea.  For this.  See?  See?  From Waterworld.  I know.  You don't have to tell me twice, Travdog.  Jesus.  We're in trouble.  Waterworld.  We're in trouble.  Waterworld is going to save the Gulf. 
[01:32:30]  We're counting on Kevin Costner.  And his scientist brother.  Oh, boy.  Scientist brother.  How does that happen?  One becomes an actor and one becomes a scientist.  Happens all the time, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  Me and my brother just didn't want to do any real work.  That was our, you know, thing in common.  And you're both successful.  I was involved in music.  Yeah.  Both entertaining people.  Entertainment field kind of a thing.  That's a, you know. 
[01:33:00]  And then little Dawn, he's in retail.  How did that happen?  See?  You got one in your family.  Yeah.  Very different career pass.  Oh, the Sex and the City fucking trailer.  Oh, look.  Oh, she's dancing.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Now they're in Abu Dhabi.  And here's...  Along with some of the other girls who work here.  I don't want to embarrass Candice, but she is coming up next on this show.  All right.  Should we show her what I did?  Oh, what'd you do?  She shaved like a political message into her pussy hair.  Careful. 
[01:33:30]  Careful on that one.  Huh?  Oh, what?  You know?  Oh, really?  It's the only one I don't make fun of because I've heard things.  Maybe has a significant...  They make a fine spaghetti sauce in that family.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, hey, yeah.  Hey, yeah.  They make a money god.  Yeah.  I've heard things over the years.  Mm-hmm.  Crazy Train, the smooth jazz version. 
[01:34:00]  Danny, I don't know what this is about, but I think you told me it's the same guy that  did the Metallica one?  Yeah.  I remember a few weeks back, probably about three, four weeks, we played that smooth jazz  version of Enter Sandman.  Right.  Where basically the guy ripped out James Hetfield's vocals from a live performance.  Right.  And then played the instruments himself, by the way, and did a little smooth jazz cover  and put the real vocals in there, and it sounded awesome.  And it confused everybody because people were just thinking that James Hetfield was in on  the goof and decided to do like a smooth jazz version of Enter Sandman.  I showed my...  Because it matches up perfectly. 
[01:34:30]  Perfectly.  Because the tempo is identical.  Right.  So I showed my friend the video, because the video on YouTube, it's them on stage, like  you know, it looks like they're in Brazil or something.  Like 100,000 people.  Yeah.  And you hear this smooth jazz.  So my friend's watching it, and he goes, well, I guess they like that kind of stuff  down there, huh?  And I'm just like, no, it's not real.  Don't you get it?  That's how talented this guy is that puts this together, because you really think that  the band is in on it.  You got a new one with Ozzy?  Yeah.  Crazy Train?  I guess the popularity of that last one was so high that he decided to do another one. 
[01:35:00]  And this one, he does Crazy Train.  So we got to make it perfectly clear, Ozzy's not in on this.  Just ripped Ozzy's vocals.  That's right.  And then he puts some smooth jazz behind Ozzy, and it came out like this. 
[01:35:30]  We're watching the video.  It's syncing up perfectly.  The old Ozzy video.  Crazy. 
[01:36:00]  Crazy.  But that's how it goes.  Millions of people.  Living this flow.  Maybe.  It's not the place.  Okay.  Okay.  To learn how to love.  And forget how to hate. 
[01:36:30]  Mental wounds I leave.  Life's a big leap to see.  I'm going off the rails on a crazy train.  Get the fuck out of here.  Sounds nice.  Relaxing. 
[01:37:00]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I listen to preachers.  I listen to fools.  I like a little key change last night.  I want to know you drop out.  We'll make you drop out.  We'll make you rule.  We'll make you decision to rule and control. 
[01:37:30]  The media's dancing.  Can you live and roll?  Make a little move still scream.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Driving me escape.  I'm going off the rails on a crazy train.  Hey.  I'm going off the rails on a crazy train.  I know that things are going wrong for me. 
[01:38:00]  You've got to listen to my words.  Look at Ozzy's cock.  Yeah.  He's wearing a shirt with Ozzy on the front like no one would know who he is.  That's 81 from a show called After Hours, yeah. 
[01:38:30]  30 years ago.  This is the part I kind of don't like because it just rocks too hard.  It's too good.  It's actually Randy's solo.  Yeah.  He's just playing it perfectly on a jazz guitar.  That makes crazy train sound like a mellow song, though.  It's so weird.  Bum, bum.  Bum, bum.  Bum, bum.  I like that part. 
[01:39:00]  I'm having a hard time watching The Prince of Darkness as he's wearing like western tassels.  I know.  Yeah.  He really did dress silly back in the 80s.  Yeah.  70s too, though.  He would wear the shirts with the fucking tassels hanging off.  That was a Sabbath throwback.  And he's chubby and he has blonde hair.  He looks like Mindy Cullen from The Facts of Life.  Fucking Natalie. 
[01:39:30]  White shoes, white pants.  That's too heavy right there, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, they could have, like, kept a little more mellow, I think.  It's hard with his vocals, though, I guess, to mellow the song out anymore.  Yeah, it's true.  It just rocks too hard. 
[01:40:00]  See?  You can't take the rock out of Ozzy.  Look out the verse.  Look out the verse.  The old hammer fist blow on the neck of your guitar.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy does more of these, because they're actually really funny. 
[01:40:30]  This is as rocking as you can get in this genre.  Rocks a little too much.  It does rock too much.  I like the part where it was going, like, ba-dee-do, ba-dee-do, do-do, do-do, do-do.  Not bad.  And someone's saying, is that the same guy that did NRC, man?  Yeah, we explained that.  Yep, yep, yep.  I mean, Ozzy wasn't in on that.  You just ripped the vocals, and then he added all the smooth jazz instruments, just so you  know, once again. 
[01:41:00]  With that said, Josh in Cleveland.  Josh?  Morning, boys.  How you doing?  Well, how are you doing, knowing that you're going to lose LeBron?  LeBron James.  Nah, our economy's already in the shitter anyways.  Who cares if he leaves?  I like the guy.  He's got a nice sense of who gives a shit.  Where you at with the LeBron James watch?  Oh, my God.  41 days, and he becomes a free agent, and the whole world is talking about it.  I'm keeping tabs on this every second.  What do you think?  Where does he go?  Wow.  Who gives a flying fuck is my answer to that whole thing. 
[01:41:30]  You know, B.  Before we had the guy, so what's different when he leaves?  Being a long-time Knicks fan who hasn't watched the Knicks in 10 years, I really hope that  LeBron James comes here, and then I'll start watching again.  We've had a bit of a dry spell.  I know nothing about basketball, but it seems he does have a few options.  I think he goes Nets because of the stupid Jay-Z, which will be his buddy.  But he's not staying in Cleveland, Josh. 
[01:42:00]  I'm sorry to tell you.  What do you got for the show?  I got all my LeBron news from a certain website.  I could imagine.  Just your show.  Huh?  Just your show.  Go ahead.  You ass.  But this guy that did the Metallica and the Ozzy videos, he's done like, he does a radio  Disney version of Cannibal Corpse, hammer smashed face.  I don't know if that's the same guy.  I saw that video today.  I don't know.  I don't think that's the same guy.  You don't think it's the same guy?  No, because it's not jazz.  Danny thinks you're a horse's patoot.  And we do, too.  Exactly. 
[01:42:30]  All right, so your call was a waste of time.  Of course it was.  It was nothing.  He's added nothing to the program.  That's right, sir.  You've done nothing.  Yeah, the program.  You've slammed the door shut on fun like a Get Smart opening.  You called it.  All right, with that, let's say hi to His Highness, Ian Halperin.  Oh, Ian.  How are you, Ian?  Hey, I'm very good.  First off, a big mazel tov to Mr. Opie, and that's really good news. 
[01:43:00]  Well, thank you, Ian.  Congratulations.  Welcome to the world of fatherhood.  Are you a father yourself there, Ian?  I think you've said that over the last month.  Very proud father.  Very proud father.  And a lot of people listening to this, especially in the media, have met my daughter over the years.  And there's nothing like it.  And I predict, here's my next prediction.  Uh-oh.  In the year 2031, batting fourth for the New York Mets, Hudson Hughes.  Wow. 
[01:43:30]  Interesting.  Batting cleanup.  Mark it down right now.  I had basketball skills growing up.  And he's going to be a Met.  You think?  Cleanup.  Yeah, absolutely.  Home run hitter?  Why would you wish injuries on Opie's son?  Being a Met, of course.  Yeah, the Mets are falling apart.  Hey, Ian, where are you calling from?  Are you trying to get a word in edgewise?  Yeah, I forgot.  Crazy?  Since Yankee Clipper and since a guy by the name of George Herman Ruth. 
[01:44:00]  Wow.  I'm raising the next Babe Ruth and I don't even know it.  I just know Babe Ruth.  I don't know George Herman.  That's Ruth Gordon.  And do you know who he's named after?  Yes, Ruth Gordon.  You're going to hit a home run, Ricky.  Sorry.  He's named after the 19th century faith missionary, Hudson Taylor.  You're amongst home run hitters.  You're on murderer's row, Ricky.  Who the fuck is Hudson Taylor? 
[01:44:30]  He's the famous 19th century faith missionary.  What?  Freak missionary?  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  It's a catchphrase.  It's a catchphrase.  Google it.  Google it.  I love it.  I love a good catchphrase.  We won't remember Kate Hudson, but Hudson Hughes will be batting cleanup for the Mets.  Mark it down.  That's my...  That would be nice.  ...perhaps final prediction.  All right.  Let's get into some of your...  All right.  Let's not.  Montreal's all excited.  What?  Norton's soon coming to Montreal. 
[01:45:00]  Norton.  I am.  Are you soon coming to Montreal, Norton?  I am doing the nasty show in the Montreal Festival, which doesn't even fucking...  They have my face nowhere on that festival site.  Ah.  You know what?  Just call my buddy, Andy Nolman.  He was just appointed, reappointed CEO and director of the festival.  He took an 11-year hiatus.  Wow.  And last week they announced he's the boss in charge of Just for Laughs again.  Just give him a call.  Use my name.  And tell him if you're not the poster boy for this Just for Laughs festival, I'm going 
[01:45:30]  to walk in with four skanks from St. Catherine Street and blow up his office.  Am I going to see you up there, Ian?  Are you going to come?  Absolutely.  I'm going to be in the front row, man.  It'd be nice to see you.  I'd like to have a nice social dinner with Ian.  Would you?  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm going to take Norton out on the town.  I know he has a girlfriend, so we've got to keep it clean.  But I'm going to take him to Schwartz to smoke me.  All right.  That's a good place to eat?  You're going to smoke me with Ian.  Did you hear what he said?  Yeah.  We're going to have to sell it out.  Even if I have to stand outside with a cane and bring in people, there's no way my boy 
[01:46:00]  Norton's not going to have anything less than a salad.  Well, there's a bunch of acts on the show.  Honestly, that show sells itself.  In 13 shows, they'll all be sold out.  And that literally depends on any comics that work.  It'll sell it out.  All right, Ian.  What material are you going to deliver there?  Very dirty.  Some Tiger Woods stuff.  Ian, where are you calling us from today?  I never give up the location because a lot of people might want to track me down.  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  I just got to keep it under the radar.  That's why.  Any girls today in bed with you?  Absolutely.  Really?  Who do you got today?  I don't kiss and tell.  Well, is she awake?  Can she just yell hello from the background?  Well, she is totally sleeping right now.  And I kid you not, I'm looking right at her.  How long do those roofies laugh?  Well, you know, I'll tell you.  Anthony, he sells the best ones New York has ever seen. 
[01:47:00]  I get them off him.  We're good friends off the air.  You and Ant?  Yeah.  Did you realize this, Ant?  That you and him are good friends off the air?  I'll realize it at some point.  Sure.  But, yes, me and Ian, of course, we hang out a lot.  We talk.  We email.  We share blood.  We share blood.  Yeah, of course.  Not intentional, though, but Anthony's asshole just can't take what is being put into it.  Share blood and stool.  Ian, are we going to hear any playing today?  Are you going to sing for us today?  I know we're going to do the gossip thing, but you usually give us a little extra something-something. 
[01:47:30]  What are you going to give us today?  Oh, man.  A little extra.  Let me talk about LeBron James.  How about that?  Oh, yeah.  What do you got on LeBron James?  He's coming to New York, whether you like it or not.  Yeah, he's either going to be a net or a nick.  Is this guaranteed?  No, he's going to come to.  He's going to be a nick.  You think?  There's no doubt about it.  You think?  Play at the garden?  This guy Chandler got arrested the other day smoking some doobies.  I didn't know it was still illegal, that stuff, because I've been to California a lot recently. 
[01:48:00]  They're selling this shit in stores like supermarkets.  It's all legal there now.  But, you know, this guy got arrested the other day.  I think he took the hit for LeBron, so they could just free up some doobies on LeBron.  Chandler will probably never play another quarter, another minute again for the Knicks.  But LeBron's coming.  This is the biggest thing New York will see since Reggie Jackson came to the Yankees, I think it was in 77, when George Steinbrenner.  You know, Jackson was going to come to Montreal, to the Expos. 
[01:48:30]  No, I'm serious about that.  This is a true story.  He was about to sign with the Expos, and then Steinbrenner did the greatest thing.  He brought Jackson to New York and said, let's walk down Broadway.  And he just walked down Broadway, and the place erupted.  They treated him like a king.  He signed on the dotted line, and the rest was history.  I mean, there's no way in a million years that LeBron is not coming. 
[01:49:00]  You know what?  I like what Ian's saying, because I do remember this.  Yes.  And if you're LeBron James, of course you want to win a title for Cleveland.  But at this point, you've got a chance to come to New York.  How do you say no?  How do you say no to that?  Just in the endorsements.  Just in the endorsements.  Yeah, because people are saying, well, he can make more money if he stays where he's at.  But, I mean, endorsement dollars, the endorsement dollars go way up if he's in New York City.  Guaranteed.  So he makes a hell of a lot more money off the court. 
[01:49:30]  Just the slice he's going to get from endorsements.  I'm going to tell you, I'm predicting right now, the first season he comes, they're not even making the playoffs.  Nothing.  Moses couldn't turn around the Knicks.  Yeah, they need a little more help than LeBron James.  I think everyone knows that.  Absolutely.  It's a team sport.  But he won't be there.  He'll show up.  He won't wear 23, right?  Because they're trying to retire Jordan's number.  He'll probably wear six.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[01:50:00]  Ian, I know you like to talk over everybody.  But what do you mean they're retiring Jordan's number throughout the whole league?  Well, yes.  In hockey, they retired Gretzky's number.  No one's allowed to wear 99 on any team.  In baseball, they did it to Jackie Robinson, number 42.  They retired every team.  And in basketball, they're trying to – it might be passing any minute, but it looks like it's going to pass.  No team – every team's going to hang up 23.  Right.  Now, I've got to stop you again because Carolina, man, I don't know how he knows this, 
[01:50:30]  but he says that apparently LeBron has been seen house shopping in Chicago this week  because the Bulls are one of the teams that he could possibly go to as well.  It ain't going to happen.  No.  It ain't going to happen.  They can't afford him.  And what about this rumor that he's been house shopping in Chicago?  He's been hoe shopping in Chicago.  Oh, see?  He's been the best host.  Yeah.  He's got it wrong, but there's no way he's house shopping.  I guarantee you that.  Okay.  Well, we've got 41 days to wait, and then we'll see what's going to happen with LeBron James. 
[01:51:00]  Ian, I want to talk a little Hollywood here.  Hollywood!  Yeah!  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Hollywood.  I was coming to my premiere in a couple of weeks.  We didn't get the invite, Ian.  No one has got the invite yet.  It's 48 hours in advance because apparently people want to shoot me for doing the movie.  Can you tell me the date, Ian, so I know if I'm around?  It's going to be – I won't say the date.  Tell me when you're out of town, and I'll let you know.  I've got a lot of dates away.  This guy is a man of mystery.  This Ian Halpern's a man of mystery. 
[01:51:30]  He won't tell us anything.  It's all intrigue.  I think he's an international spy.  There you go, Beth.  Security threat.  You know, security risks.  But it's going to happen in the next two weeks.  Okay.  And yet everyone's getting their invite.  You know, I'll give you guys a heads up, obviously, off the air.  Oh, so you're going to give us 48 hours to get out to L.A.  We really appreciate that.  Actually, it's going to be closer to home.  You'll be very surprised.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  All right.  All right, Ian.  All right.  Anthony wants to talk Hollywood.  What do you got on Hollywood? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, what do you got?  Any new news?  Celebs?  What's going on?  Let's look at American Idol.  All right, let's.  I went to my blog a year and a half ago.  I predicted both Cal and Abdul were leaving.  Everyone was making fun of me again.  We all know the rest is history.  Look, I'm not Nostradamus, but I am Nostradamus of Hollywood.  There was an article about that recently.  Where's Idol going?  I don't think.  I think Idol is on its last legs, but they are talking about moving it to New York. 
[01:52:30]  And I'd like your guys' opinion on that.  This reminds me of when the National Enquirer moved to New York.  Well, what would that do?  Well, Ian, I got my opinion.  You asked me for my opinion, right?  Yes.  My opinion is who gives a shit?  Yeah, no one cares.  I agree.  All right.  I think it's going to bomb there.  Although what?  They move Ryan Seacrest into Simon's chair?  Is that what you're thinking?  What?  No, they'll keep him as host.  Yeah.  You know, they really got to come up with a home run here. 
[01:53:00]  Well, they'll bring back Paul Abdul.  That'll create some interest next year.  And that's that, I think.  Let me ask you a question.  Would either of you guys leave this chair to replace Cal right now?  How much does it pay?  Wow.  Yeah.  What were the hours?  Yeah.  How much money?  Famous Spinal Tap Line.  That's right.  Yes.  Yeah, of course we would leave for a big gig like that, Ian.  We've been doing radio way too long, and we're just waiting for that next opportunity. 
[01:53:30]  The big gig for the chair.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Who the hell knows?  Ian, I'm kind of mad at you.  You did a blind item a couple weeks ago about a TV host that may be having an affair, and  then it finally comes out that it was Matt Lauer, and you knew that the whole time, and  you're not giving us any names on this show.  Well, actually, I like Matt.  I've been on his show.  And obviously he's denying the allegations, but your blind item... 
[01:54:00]  It's like racism.  Well, not everybody.  You know, let me tell you something.  Lauer, look, the guy obviously, you know, he's carrying a Louisville slugger in his pants.  There's no doubt about it, because this isn't the first time this has happened.  But one thing I'll say about Lauer, and I say this in every lecture I give, most people  who show, I've done it with everyone, interviews in the last 20 years, I've been, you know,  from everyone you could think of, I've met them, been interviewed by them. 
[01:54:30]  One night, Lauer interviewed me for Dateline.  It was at the Royalton Hotel, you know, that submarine, weird hotel in New York.  And so I walked in, I partied all night.  I walk into the Royalton, I thought Matt Lauer was going to be a piece of cake.  He was the sharpest journalist on the, you know, on the planet.  The guy knew his shit, no cheat notes, nothing.  Four hours later, man, I was tanned when I walked in. 
[01:55:00]  I was pale as a ghost.  This guy knew his shit.  And I congratulated him after the interview.  What he's doing, hey, you know, the guy was dating a Dutch model, all kinds of women.  You know, look, the guy's making big paper, and he wants to party.  Big paper, that's a lot of money to the layman.  The guy would be accepted, because as a journalist, people are against him.  Who cares what he's doing?  So even though he's denying it, you're saying it's, is it?  Well, what do you, do we really expect Matt Lauer to admit it in the milieu he's in, you know, with NBC? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, of course.  It's going to cause a huge scandal.  It's going to bring down the ivory tower, you know.  But of course it's going on.  Everyone's banging everyone in that building.  I've worked a lot with NBC.  He's not the only guy.  All right, so that's what you've got on that.  So what about any new gossip, any new blind items?  Where are we going here?  I want to give you a new blind item today.  This is right off to His Highness ticker tape. 
[01:56:00]  Let's try to figure this out.  And since we're on the topic of sports today, a Yankee player was recently involved in a threesome.  A-Rod.  Joe Pepitone.  What's he doing?  Thurman Munson.  Thurman with his wing.  With Thurman, his wing, and his engine.  Billy Martin with the fucking other guy in the windshield.  Sorry.  Sorry.  The threesome with a member of the Boston Red Sox and a high-profile woman who's a very big Wall Street executive. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, but we don't know Wall Street executives.  Yeah, but forget the Wall Street woman.  But you're talking a Yankees player and a Red Sox player in the field.  Wow.  Now that's competition, putting a Wall Street bitch on the rotisserie like that?  Yeah.  How's that?  Let's see.  Who could that be?  That's a pretty good item.  Are they starting players?  They're high-profile players.  So he's not sure if they start.  I wouldn't want to share with Big Poppy. 
[01:57:00]  I wouldn't either.  That would be terrible.  Maybe they do start, but, you know, one might be a pitcher.  I don't want to give it away.  All right, but they're names we all know.  Yes, it was.  Absolutely.  It's not some dumb utility player.  It's really popular.  Was it Oil Can Boyd?  Oil Can Boyd.  Oil Can Boyd.  He was a throwback to the old Negro Leagues.  And he used to wear socks up, and he was a real competitor.  He could play on his finest team anytime.  It was Louis Tiant.  That was the guy.  It was Louis Tiant and Jim Rice. 
[01:57:30]  What's El Tiant doing today?  What?  Louis Tiant.  That's a good name.  Yes.  A blast from the past.  Man, that guy, his wind-up was so erratic.  Yeah.  He had that sidearm delivery, didn't he?  He had that back and just fire away.  Yeah, yeah.  And he would stop halfway through.  He would, like, kick back.  He would kick back.  And then before he threw, it's almost like a brief pause in midair.  Ridiculous.  And that's how he fucks, too.  He pulls his cock back, and his leg kicks up, and then he jams it in. 
[01:58:00]  Take that.  Yeah.  All right.  So we got that blind item, and then the news will report in a week, and we'll get no credit  for it.  So thanks once again, Ian Halpern, for that.  Demi Moore.  Yeah, would you read a book about Demi Moore?  No.  An authorized...  No.  I would if it was called Photos of My Pussy.  Just 248 pages of photos of my pussy.  Can you imagine if she released a book called Photos of My Pussy? 
[01:58:30]  How many pages would you go through before you go, all right, I'm done with her stupid  pussy.  Oh, everyone.  Three 1,100-page volumes.  Might not be over it.  Because early on, she had a big, hairy-ass muff.  Oh, yeah.  Big, hairy-fucking-muff.  Ian, you like the hairy muff?  No.  No.  No.  You know, I'm not into this.  You don't go old school every once in a while just for the goof?  I like it mixed up.  I like it mixed up.  Europeans like to go that route.  Mix it up, I say.  His highness likes it very clean, very coiffed, and, you know, he likes it like silk. 
[01:59:00]  One day smooth as silk, and the next day I want fucking Rastafarian hair.  Oh, right.  Boy, you gotta pull it all back to find the cliff.  You never fucked a Rasta?  Old school.  No.  Why?  Wrong color for it.  Why would you say that?  I only have sex with white girls.  Really?  You've never banged a woman darker than his highness?  No, you know, there have been girls that have had good tans and stuff like that. 
[01:59:30]  Ian, I had a chance to do that, and she smelled.  Oh, well.  Because she was on her period.  Let me continue.  So I didn't get the opportunity because this particular woman of color was on her.  She had a friend.  Smelled like Kennedy's scalp.  How's Jennifer Aniston's pussy lately?  It's still smelling up the joint?  Yeah, Aniston, man. 
[02:00:00]  It was just revealed again that she just can't keep a guy.  There was an article I read.  I don't know.  There's something just so fishy about her.  Literally.  Literally.  It's the fish smell.  I'm telling you.  I got that one figured out because someone like her who really wants a man, who really  wants to have kids, and she has nobody, it's a pussy thing.  Maybe it's a personality.  All kidding aside, you're 100% right.  And considering her godfather's Tully Zavolis, you got it one day.  Yeah, you figure it out.  Is it really?  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  Think you'd put a lollipop in her vag?  Yeah.  Take it out?  Who loves it?  Play his club.  Tully was Greek, right?  I'm starting to think Greek pussy doesn't smell too good, Ed.  I could smell your cunt.  Smells like rotting fetish.  Rotting fetish.  Smells like Stravos' feet.  Who loves you, dumpster pussy?  A friend of mine actually has a crush on Anthony.  Could I fix, could this be a blind date?  What's that?  Yeah.  Anthony, you want to go on a blind date? 
[02:01:00]  One of Ian's friends has a crush on you.  Who is it?  She's a woman in Montreal who works as a waitress.  Yeah.  She says she listens to you on Sirius Radio.  She's 24 years old and she used to be a gymnast.  Oh, really?  What color is she?  Is she white?  She's white.  Oh.  How did she, it depends on why is she not a gymnast?  Did she put on 140 pounds?  She's not 260 and she can't be a gymnast?  She stopped competing because it was, you know, at a certain age she realized she had 
[02:01:30]  to do something else.  Unfortunately, I like the ages where they can still compete.  Yes.  When they're first starting.  Absolutely.  I'm teasing, of course.  Anthony likes where they're still just starting their ballet lessons.  They have dreams.  Her nickname in Montreal is White Chocolate.  Why White Chocolate?  Uh-oh.  That's what people call her.  I have no idea.  Uh-oh.  That might mean she's what they call on some of these websites a coal burner.  Either she fucks a lot of black guys or she shits her pants.  Why is she White Chocolate? 
[02:02:00]  We're both.  A coal burner?  That is so bad.  Ian, you didn't finish with Demi Moore.  What's going on with her and Ashton?  With all these books, Demi Moore, she's shopping a book in New York.  Look, all these books with celebrities, they're written by stiffs like myself.  They're hired to write it.  Demi Moore gives you an hour of her time, and then you're on your own, and you got a pen,  and then she'll do the publicity, and she'll make the bulk of the money.  This is how it works.  But, you know, I don't think a book on Demi Moore is worth publishing, perhaps an unauthorized version. 
[02:02:30]  And, you know, CNN, there was a story on CNN a couple of weeks ago, and His Highness, yours truly, was in the top three.  Kitty Kelly, Christopher Anderson, and His Highness were pointed out as the top unauthorized biographers.  And, you know, is it worth my time to even open the door to Demi Moore to do an unauthorized biographer?  But you're also saying that Demi and Ashton might be through, right? 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  Apparently, they've had more trouble than Liz and Richard the seven times they were married.  Or how many, where were they married, three, four times?  I don't know.  I don't keep track of that stuff.  There was a lot of tension there.  Yeah.  Including accusations of a lot of stuff against Kutcher with one of the kids.  Huh?  Local ball.  What happened to Ashton Kutcher?  Those accusations are false. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  And also an accusation of Kutcher, whatever his name is, and Zac Efron having a steamy night one night.  I've never seen any proof.  Wow.  This is what my sources are.  Well, that's pretty outrageous to say.  Yeah.  Well, hey.  That's like some gay stuff.  Seen it all.  Ian's right there, you know.  We have seen it all.  We don't know.  We don't know what Ian's talking about.  Just when something happens.  His people are saying it to him, but we don't know, and he doesn't know.  All right.  Well, John Travolta, anything there? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Travolta's dogs were killed at the main airport a few days back.  They think it was a murder-suicide.  They actually weren't his dogs.  They were cleaning his wigs.  They were mistaken for dogs.  Yeah.  The plane wheel ran over two of his wigs.  His wigs.  I'm on fire today, Norton.  But what about the fact that he's expecting now, him and his wife? 
[02:04:30]  A day later, they kill the dogs, and a day later, they announce that a baby's on the way.  Go figure.  I mean, look, Travolta, I disagree with his affiliation to the Church of Scientology.  Yeah.  And I also believe he's certainly bisexual.  I've interviewed gay lovers of his over the years.  Come out, and a day later, this guy, he lost his son, unfortunately, about a year and a half ago.  So I just don't know what's going on with John these days, but, you know, he just seems to be grasping at straws here, 
[02:05:00]  trying to do as much damage control as possible.  And is she really going to deliver a baby?  I have no idea.  How old is she?  47, I think.  47?  And he's 53, 54?  Well, it doesn't matter with the guy as far as having a baby.  He had miles of cock in her before John.  Jesus.  He had miles of cock.  Trust me on that, he says. 
[02:05:30]  Well, I guess we'll have to, even though we, once again, have no idea what Ian's talking about.  Because they were having some marital problems.  Yeah.  Who's the dad?  Because, you know, the last I really heard, John ain't been into women lately.  You making allegations of infidelity is outrageous, and I will not sit for that on our program, Ian.  That's right, Ian.  I will not accept that.  I will not accept you making these infidelity.  I absolutely want you to retract that right now from our airwaves. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  Let me make an official O&A retraction here.  Okay.  If Travolta, I'll give you guys a waiver.  If Travolta comes after me with litigation or whatever, or sends some stiffs after me, some heavies, I waive the liability of O&A.  Not Norton, because Norton's a good pal of mine.  I know he'll stand up for me.  He'll take this.  All right, Ian. 
[02:06:30]  Enough with the gossip.  What are you going to leave us with today?  Sometimes you play an interesting...  Tape this.  Yeah.  Okay?  Because I used to do some public announcing at hockey games in Montreal.  Okay.  Did you?  So we're going to tape this right now.  We're rolling tape.  We're rolling tape.  We're rolling tape.  All right.  Batting fourth.  The first baseman.  The premier, Hudson Hughes.  Wow.  That will be used sometime in the future. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, sometime in the future.  I didn't know you were a sports announcer.  2030.  2030.  Jesus Christ.  Will we all be...  Will the four of us still be breathing?  Who's going to be the first to go?  I hope he's going to be in his 40s by then.  Oh, 50.  52.  And by the way, I'm buying the plot for the four of us.  We're all going to be resting.  Oh, God.  What a nightmare.  Have this guy for eternity just rubbing elbows with you.  I'm making the offer right now.  Google it.  Google it.  Shut up.  I'm trying to eternally sleep here. 
[02:07:30]  Maybe I'll buy it right next to MJ.  We'll all be in the forest lawn together.  That'll be good.  Who's going to be on top of who?  Hey, well, you know, with MJ, you never know.  Look, MJ's my man.  Yep.  I love the guy.  Everyone misses him.  And look, you know, the gay allegation.  Someone came out.  His own doctor.  Another guy came out.  Jason Pfeiffer on the record.  It's not me fabricating.  Isn't it ironic that right now he probably looks exactly like he did in 
[02:08:00]  a thriller?  Ian, and you really have a Michael Jackson film coming out?  Yes.  Okay.  And we might be invited to the premiere.  Oh, yeah, 100%.  You're going to be introducing it.  Oh.  And it's going to be close to where we live?  Yes.  That's all I can give you.  So you're going to have it in Jersey somewhere?  No, probably in the Bronx next to Yankee Stadium.  All right.  No, we're going to do it somewhere nice. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  Good.  Ian, we've got to let you go because we've got to.  Peace out to everyone.  Yeah.  This is his highness checking out on the O&A show.  I wish everyone a good day, a good week, good weekend, and hope everyone has a smile  on their face like his highness.  Peace out.  All right.  Thank you, his highness.  He's got an official out now.  I think he's going to end with that every time.  He certainly does, doesn't he?  All right.  What?  Oh, nice.  Laszlo's here.  We're going to be talking about the new game and some other tech stuff.  We're going to be playing the game too? 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  It's all set up, ready to go?  Oh, fuck.  All right.  I think it's me and Laszlo.  Ants in the bathroom.  Jimmy just walked out.  What's going on, Laszlo?  You know, traveling the world.  Man.  Yeah, you were in London?  Yeah, I was in London showing off Red Dead Redemption and then.  Now, before we start talking about the game, what did you do for fun?  Because you're one of those guys, you just don't go to these cities. 
[02:09:30]  You try to have a little fun and do something, right?  Um, yeah, I got pretty drunk, I have to say.  Most of the day I was just doing interviews all day long.  But the television in the hotels is amazing in London.  Why?  Because they show titties?  Dude, not only titties, they got channels of people that will post their picture and  then you can send text messages to them that show up on the screen.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and they've got one that's all guys.  It's hysterical.  It's all these British dudes trying to fuck in the park. 
[02:10:00]  And you're texting these guys?  Oh, dude, your text message shows up on the screen on the television.  It's hysterical.  And it's in real time?  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  And then I caught myself and said, you know, I'm sitting here texting gay men on TV.  It's time to watch Lost.  Who's going to blame you for the goof?  For the goof, I think.  And then they've got to do it.  They've got these other channels where you can call and talk to the chicks live and you're  watching them on TV. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We have some of that in America, don't we?  I don't know.  I haven't really seen it in hotel rooms.  Well, not in hotel rooms.  But, I mean, it's on their main basic cable.  Wherever you go in Europe or the UK, their main basic cable, after about 10 or 11 o'clock,  there's all these channels.  Yeah.  And, like, chicks making out topless and all this, and you can call in and talk to  them.  But you don't even need to call in.  You just spank it and you're done.  Yeah, you just want to watch.  That's all right, man.  I mean, we're fucking a bunch of prudes in America.  Just scared of the titty. 
[02:11:00]  Now, I'm looking at Red Dead Redemption.  And you've got your game guy here.  Yeah.  And I've got to tell you, the graphics don't look that great.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I appreciate it.  Anthony Mackett's studio.  And I go, you know what?  I don't think the graphics look that great.  I just told Laszlo.  No, the graphics are just...  When you think the graphics can't get better, they do just that.  They get better.  Look at this guy running up the... 
[02:11:30]  It's ridiculous.  Look at this.  That looks amazing.  Well, they can't see it because it's radio, Laszlo.  Yeah.  So where do we start with Red Dead Redemption?  We basically took our open world engine, the Rage engine.  That you kind of did with GTA.  Yeah.  And we built on top of it.  So we built basically what is an open world Western shooter.  And I mean, you can get on a horse in this game and just ride for miles.  Will anyone bother you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is there a way to just ride the horse where you just pick the particular route where no 
[02:12:00]  one bothers you?  No, you always come...  You can have a nice, peaceful ride.  Where you just want to go out on a nice ride.  No, the thing that's nice about the game is, you know, while it's this huge, beautiful,  open Western, there's always stuff going on.  You know, like as you're going down the road, somebody will wave you down and say, can you  please help me?  This guy just robbed me.  Well, you can shoot her in the face and rob her too, or you can help her out and go chase  the guys down. 
[02:12:30]  And what happens is...  Well, there are consequences to what you do.  Everything in the game changes how people react to you.  So if you're a horrible, despicable human being and you've been a nasty guy out on the road,  when you come into town, people start saying snarky stuff at you.  Yeah, they'll challenge you to a duel.  But wait a minute.  If you're in the middle of nowhere and some lady's like, help me because I just got robbed  and you shoot her in the face, who's going to know that you just shot her in the face?  It's the old West.  The game does.  You'll get a reputation.  Someone might be looking over a ridge and chill you back in town and go, that's the guy. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  It changes your fame and honor in the game.  Another thing that we did is...  Oh, look at the graphics.  That's in-game too, right?  Yeah, that's all in-game.  Why is there a woman with a dog?  I don't understand it.  No, you're watching the news.  Oh, sorry.  It's the other TV.  That looks like a friendly game.  One of the things that we did with the world is we populated it with an entire ecosystem  so animals will actually feed on each other.  So you'll see like a wolf or a bobcat chasing a deer. 
[02:13:30]  They ever chase you?  Oh, yeah.  You'll get attacked by wolves.  Just minding your own business.  Yeah, you can be going through the mountains, going through this peaceful snow.  Not to stop you, but we're looking at kind of a mountain scene right now.  Yeah, this is down in Mexico.  With the water in the distance.  That is ridiculous looking.  That looks great.  Holy shit.  He's on the big cannon inflation.  Yeah, he's about to rain some...  Oh, these guys are going to have some hurt come down on him.  Horses all fall over. 
[02:14:00]  They just killed their horse totally.  Wow.  You're a bastard.  You were saying, Laszlo, I'm sorry.  Yeah, the animals.  So there was a few weeks ago we were working on one of our multiplayer clips.  And so we had like six guys in the office that were all on horses and they were on the edge of this ridge.  And they were doing their best to like line up for this really nice shot.  And wow, that wagon is in pieces.  Wow.  They're lining up for this really nice shot.  And all of a sudden all these wolves came out of the forest and attacked them. 
[02:14:30]  And so you hear all these guys around the office screaming and cursing as their characters are dragged off their horses by wolves.  It's hysterical.  So the game really never lets you sit still for very long.  There's always something going on.  There's always something you've got to try to figure out.  And you've made the target.  The cool thing is like the focal point to shoot is a little white dot.  It's not like a big circle or any of these obnoxious things.  It really doesn't take you out of anything.  That is something how those wagons came apart.  He shot them with a cannon.  And he shot one wagon and the whole frame, the bottom frame you see fly up in the air. 
[02:15:00]  And then he hit it in a different spot that next time.  And you just saw the wheels fly off the thing.  Like everything reacts a little differently.  You don't have that same monotonous.  All right, I shot someone.  They fall the same way.  Or this blows up the same way.  It does take you out of the game.  But I really want to just go.  It's very unique.  I really just want to take a horse for a ride.  Yeah, you could do that.  A nice peaceful ride.  Go to Brooklyn.  They've got a rental string.  You could just go down there and ride on the beach. 
[02:15:30]  What are you going to do?  Can you hop in a wagon and ride it?  Yes, you can.  Yay!  What if you don't know how to ride a wagon?  Are you going to have a problem?  You can ride in the back.  You don't have to always drive.  I want to be the driver.  Does it rain in this game?  Yeah, the weather patterns are actually pretty amazing.  Yeah.  And the night looks better than any nighttime I've ever seen in a game.  Really?  That's something.  I've had a few people.  Make it rain, Forrest.  I've had a few people already.  Wait, did you go into an actual rainforest?  No, no, no. 
[02:16:00]  I said his name is Forrest.  I told him to make it rain.  Forrest.  Right.  I don't want a large farver.  We've got a dev kit so we can basically change...  Forrest.  Hey, is he Fierce Gump?  Hey, this girl's getting fucked up, Laszlo.  I don't think that's nice for the children.  What are you doing?  Oh, shit.  There's some sex going on.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Wow.  Can you just fuck broads in the game?  See, this is why we have that law in Arizona.  Your tits are showing, wow.  Yeah.  I think it's the first game we've actually had a nipple in.  You've got a fat gut.  You've got a great gut.  Was that a nipple through a shirt?  No.  That was nudity.  Okay.  So, basically, in the game, you're this guy, John Marston, who your buddies betrayed you.  You went to jail.  And now that you're out, you're tracking them down.  So, you go across the prairies into Mexico. 
[02:17:00]  God damn.  We're looking at kind of twilight at this point.  It's going to start raining here.  Yeah, and you can see the thundercloud.  He just pulled a guy off the wagon and took it.  Could he have shot him?  Yeah.  Wow.  No, he's just riding through as it's raining.  Yeah.  And the lightning is lighting up everything.  The horses will react to the thunder as well.  Oh, really?  And the horses in the game, we actually put horses in motion capture outfits that we made 
[02:17:30]  Are you shitting any real horses?  And put them on treadmills and made them run their balls off and capture them.  I must have loved that.  Horses love to run.  Did PETA have a problem with that one?  Horses on treadmills, Laszlo?  Well, you can also skin your horse and eat it in the game.  Oh, wow.  Well, that's nice.  Well, we wanted to sort of depict the bleak nature of the Old West.  Right, right.  So any animal you can kill in the game.  And also in multiplayer, you and your buddies can just roam the entire open world of the game. 
[02:18:00]  It's not like you're just in one little level.  Multiplayer, the entire world is open.  Oh, so it's not just the level.  Right.  And so you and your buddies can just ride on horses and bump into, you can form posses, bump into other posses.  You can go hunting together.  By the way, great way to spin it.  We wanted to depict the what nature of the Old West?  I don't know.  It was a great way to say that, too.  Like, we wanted to depict the nature of the Old West.  Therefore, you can kill a platypus right now.  Goddamn.  Can you ride into a western town, old school? 
[02:18:30]  Yep.  Yeah?  Yep.  And people start looking at you like, who are these fucking idiots?  Well, you start off pretty much as just some lowly guy, right?  Yeah.  You got to build your rep up.  You got to, you know, you got to make a name for yourself.  Good or bad.  Make it sunset there for us.  All right.  Hey, I like a nice sunset.  Of course.  There we go.  That looks cool.  Look at this.  Look at this.  They got a great sunlight glimmer.  The shadows are all long and stretched out.  Sun's low in the sky on the horizon.  Yeah.  This game looks fantastic.  The light is actually in your, it's uncomfortable to look into the sun. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's exactly like the way this is.  It will burn your retinas out.  That's amazing.  It really is.  Look at it.  It is.  Just walking in an old town.  Old western town.  I've had a couple people already Twitter me.  Really?  About my voice being heard.  Yeah, you're something like this subdued.  They said more subdued Yosemite Sam.  I think we got an example.  Oh, yeah.  I'll turn the game audio off for a second.  Who's Anthony in the actual game?  His name is Jeb Murphy. 
[02:19:30]  Jeb Murphy.  I'm Jeb Murphy, by the way.  If you need guns, Mr. Marston, you come see me.  Yeah, see, I'm the gun guy.  How ironic.  If you kill someone in front of Anthony, he will go to the sheriff.  His character will start running off to yelling for the sheriff.  I'm a rat.  If you give Anthony some money, just like in real life, he will shut up.  Yeah.  See?  Money makes me real forgetful. 
[02:20:00]  That's hilarious.  And here's Anthony just sort of...  Do you have Anthony yelling, string him up?  The different characters in the game will walk by each other and have conversations.  Okay.  So here's Anthony's character chatting with another character in the game.  We ain't going to maintain our regional supremacy if that bad element remains.  Bad element.  We all know what the bad element is.  Of course we do. 
[02:20:30]  I thought it was supposed to be a character I was portraying.  It's just you with an accent.  And here he is selling guns.  We can't put no price on safety.  Safety.  Of course I sell the guns.  We got the second amendment for a reason, don't we?  I was riding my horse 108 miles an hour, and Keith the Sheriff had to get me out of it.  Keith the Sheriff. 
[02:21:00]  Anthony's horse was stolen?  Yeah, you can steal people's horses in the game.  Oh, my horse been took.  Oh, my horse been took.  That's what happened when Voss disappeared when you guys were out together.  Please, can we hear the horse got took one again?  My horse.  Oh, my horse been took.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's the character right there, yeah.  Behind the counter. 
[02:21:30]  For some reason.  Looks exactly like Travis.  A little Travis look to him.  Yep.  And finally, Anthony outtakes.  These did not make the game.  Right.  Oh.  What in the wide, wide world of sports is it going on here?  It's from Blazing Tattles.  Somebody's going to have to go back and get a shitload of dimes.  Very nice.  Very talented voice guy.  That's fun. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, my God.  I had so much fun doing that.  Wow.  Look at the detail on the characters in this game.  I am going to be playing this like a mad person.  He's all scarred up.  Yeah.  He's the main dude.  Nice gunfight sequence right here.  The hand is right over the gun like Good, Bad, and the Ugly.  Got it at Derby.  And our draw.  Oh, slow-mo.  Oh, man.  Yeah, so you can paint the targets on him, but you have to be quick because his gun's  coming out.  Oh, shit. 
[02:22:30]  Wow.  Oh, did that guy get fucked.  Fuck.  That alone just sold me on the game.  Mowed him down.  Holy shit, look at that.  He got a bunch of bullets on him.  Then what happens?  Thank you.  Can you shoot that lady?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, yes.  Why would you do that?  What are you doing?  He put the shotgun up to her head and blew it off.  There's just some old, nice town woman out right in the face.  Blowing everyone away as he tries to get out of the town here.  What would happen if you just...  Could you shoot...  Oh, no. 
[02:23:00]  Sorry, friend.  Sorry, friend.  He's dragging...  Yay.  Drag a townsperson.  Yeah, you can lasso people and ride off their horses or if they're standing and just  drag their ass through the middle of town.  Can you ride your horse into the building?  Um, I believe you can.  All right, the door's open.  Oh, he's great.  Oh, he's in trouble.  Somebody out the window.  Oh, he's in trouble.  Oh, no.  I think you've started some shit.  This guy's shooting at you through the window.  You better shoot that horse. 
[02:23:30]  He shot his horse's asshole out.  Oh, God.  Horses take...  Horses not happy.  Horses take a little bit to go down, don't they?  The horse is banging on a fucking wall.  Oh, the horse's asshole got prolapsed.  God damn, this game is great.  You know, there's nothing better in a game than just sheer fucking violence and the great  look of it.  I mean, you know, I don't like games that go half-assed. 
[02:24:00]  He just threw a malto cocktail at a horse.  Horses on fire.  The horse is on fire.  This is fantastic.  The horse.  The horse.  The horse is on fire.  There we go.  Guy's trying to flee.  I think he's dead.  Oh, he's throwing knives at him.  And he's down.  Man, you know why?  Some games just fucking don't want to go the distance.  And Rockstar is just known for going the distance.  Slow motion shot.  Yeah.  The horse's body. 
[02:24:30]  So we call it the Deadeye Targeting System.  You can slow time down and paint targets on multiple people and then just mow them all  down.  Oh, very cool.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  That's a new feature, right?  Yeah.  Well, Red Dead Revolver came out in like 2004.  And we had the Deadeye in that one.  But another thing, since the game is set in 1910, we did a lot of research into the media  of the time.  And if you go to the old-timey movie theater in the game.  There's an old-timey flicker.  I want to see a flicker show and maybe have some of that cornbread, your wife, man. 
[02:25:00]  The dangers of doctors, this little short.  How long did it take you to do this?  Rockstar San Diego started on this five years ago.  So there's two old-timey silent films in the game.  One of them is about the dangers of patent medicines.  And if you'll go to one of those screenshots there and just pause that. 
[02:25:30]  So there's this guy selling the patent medicines, all of which had cocaine and so forth.  And so this gentleman comes to buy some patent medicine.  It's called Dr. Cumia's cathartic disease elixir.  Shit, that's funny.  With 99% cocaine powders.  Someone said they'd seen a Dr. Cumia in there.  And what happens is when the character takes it, he begins trying to rape a woman and then  he humps a tree. 
[02:26:00]  A young lady, I might add.  Oh, fantastic.  That is hysterical.  That's wonderful.  I am honored.  Yes.  I am honored.  The other silent film in the game, because we were looking at the research department,  said, you know, at this time there was a big political debate because people were concerned  and rightly so about women voting.  So we did an entire cartoon about the dangers of letting women vote.  Oh, my God. 
[02:26:30]  I cannot wait to get home and play this.  God damn, you guys.  So much of my time is spent on Rockstar games.  Oh, great.  It just really looks fantastic.  You do get that immersion that you like in a game, you know?  You really can just play out like you're in the old way. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, man.  Execution.  Right to the back of the head.  You know, we were watching a lot of the Clint Eastwood films and The Proposition, which is  a fantastic dark western that was done a few years ago by director John Hillcoat.  Is it an Eastwood movie?  No, no.  I think The Proposition was about five or six years ago.  And it's not that well known.  But if you like westerns, it's actually set in the turn of the century, like 1900 in Australia. 
[02:27:30]  And it's about trying to wipe out the aborigines.  It is a dark fucking film.  You guys do do a lot of research on your games, on the time, the settings and everything like that.  And it just shows.  As soon as you can, make it run for the shit.  There's so many shitty games out there that really don't put any thought behind it.  They think they could just whip up a game, throw it out there, and people are going to bite.  And it just doesn't work. 
[02:28:00]  One of the things that was interesting about writing the scripts, you know,  because you're one of the characters in the game.  There's hundreds of characters across the game world.  And every script was about 15 or 20 pages long.  You've got to have all these reactions.  Like if you go up to Anthony's character and shoot at him, he's going to say one thing.  If you try to tie him with a lasso, you'll say another.  So you have to record all these categories.  Every one of those scripts had to be approved by our research department to make sure that you weren't using words that weren't used during the period.  And I had a couple of my scripts rejected because they said you used a word that wasn't used until 1912. 
[02:28:30]  And the game is set around 1910.  What was the word?  I don't even remember what it was.  A faggot.  Marshall.  And basically the map of the world takes you from like Wyoming in the north where there's the mountains all the way down into Mexico.  So there's like border towns, pueblos.  And the vibe was trying to give you the, you know, the sense of the struggle of the West. 
[02:29:00]  And also one of the themes that since it's set right as technology and the government start to encroach on the West, there's this huge backlash from the characters and the storyline of the game to technology and government encroaching on people's lives.  Yeah.  So that's kind of cool.  Yeah.  You got, I was going to say, uh, trains, any, any interaction with the choo-choo trains?  Yes. 
[02:29:30]  There's a great mission where you can, um, ride your horse up, uh, by a train.  And, um, there's also a great Gatling gun mission.  Oh, God.  Can you get on the train?  Shoot some people apart with that.  Yeah.  You can also travel from town to town on the trains if you don't feel like riding your horse and you just want to warp from one place to another.  Right.  You can hop in a stagecoach.  How many towns are there?  How many towns are there, Forrest?  Uh, a lot.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  At Forrest just plays the game.  Look at him.  He is, you're pretty murderous on this goddamn game. 
[02:30:00]  He's been playing it for over a year.  Wow.  Every day.  For 12 hours a day.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Uh, how many different types of, uh, weapons?  Um.  About, you got, uh, I see you like the Winchester there.  Yeah, so we, we modeled, uh, the weapons on authentic weaponry from the tier.  Obviously, yeah, you're not gonna pull out an AR-15 and start going to town.  So there's multiple different pistols.  The fire bottle I really like.  That's a good one.  That one's great.  Dynamite. 
[02:30:30]  If you can throw dynamite under a wagon or a horse, it makes for some comedy.  Oh, he's got a little stick of dynamite.  Oh, yeah, that'll make a mess.  Oh, shit.  Dynamite.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I think you wiped yourself out there.  Yeah.  I've got biking ancestors.  You hear me?  I think you, um, did you blow up a black gentleman right there?  I believe he did. 
[02:31:00]  I think it was an African-American gentleman.  Good old-fashioned fist fight.  Nice.  Yeah, look at this.  What if he punch him into the cactus?  Get ugly, pal.  Look at him fighting with his dumb hat on.  Yeah.  He removed his hat.  He removed his hat.  Wait a minute.  And there you go.  Take that with you.  Lazlo, you got celebrity voices in this?  That's great.  No, not really.  Not really?  We started to record some voices in New York, which is regular voice talent, but you soon  realize that New York actors, trying to sound like they're from the West, they're so obviously 
[02:31:30]  from Brooklyn.  It wasn't working.  Right, so we went out to L.A. and did a lot of casting there and recorded hundreds of  people in L.A., including when you go into the Mexican portion of the game, it's more  Spanish than has ever been recorded for any video game in history.  Because when you cross the border, you know how in some video games, especially like the  SOCOMs and stuff like that, where the terrorists all sort of speak in that crazy, messed up  English, so you always understand.  When they're yelling at each other, it's like, why would they be yelling to each other in 
[02:32:00]  English?  This doesn't make any sense.  In the Mexican portion of the game, everybody speaks Spanish, so...  Man, what the fuck's going on, right?  Do you have subtitles?  No.  No.  So it's in real life, you wouldn't.  It's like a game and Rosetta Stone, which is really cool.  I mean, when you go into the missions and stuff, you know, the people there are speaking  English, so you're understanding the sort of cinematic...  But hey, if you were in Mexico and there was people speaking Spanish, you wouldn't know  what the fuck you're saying either.  The people that are just walking down the streets, or if you bump into somebody, they'll 
[02:32:30]  curse at you in Spanish.  That's pretty cool, Laszlo.  That's like here with Mars.  I need to know how much does this game cost to make?  Wow.  I don't know.  Is that number out there?  No, it's not.  A gillion, quadrillion.  I did see a report.  Oh, really?  You could tell me if...  I mean, it's just, you know, some gaming blog, but I saw a report that said it cost around  a hundred million.  I wouldn't doubt it.  I mean, you gotta imagine, Rockstar San Diego started this five years ago.  You know, you gotta pay salaries.  I alone got ten million just for the voices I did. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, it's fantastic.  I mean, but...  Really?  I think, you know, I think it paid off, because, you know, trying to turn around and open  World Western in a year or two, it just doesn't make any sense.  How much does it sell for?  $59.99.  Are you guys a little worried?  Sorry, Jim.  I don't know.  It says two or three million copies, and you fucking easily got your money back.  Yeah, I hope so.  They're hoping to sell a lot more than that.  Oh, no, no, but I'm just saying, you can get perhaps more than that, Jim.  You guys worried about the video gaming industry? 
[02:33:30]  Kind of, it's been down lately, hasn't it?  Yeah, but it's trending back up, I think.  I mean, everything's been down 20%.  Obviously, you guys are doing a much better job than other gaming companies.  But can we slow that down a little bit?  Why is the gaming industry down 20%?  Everyone's too busy on their phones and stuff?  Or is it an economy thing?  Yeah, all consumer goods were basically down 20%.  People just don't have that pocket money anymore.  Or as much of it.  I like how your ears sort of ring when you throw the dynamite if you're a little too close. 
[02:34:00]  Damn.  He's just running through.  He's just throwing fucking fire on people.  That's fantastic.  They're just burning.  What's he running to?  A castle?  A fort?  Yeah, he's heading into a fort.  Wow, he is really in a world of shit over here.  Slowing down.  He's targeting somebody.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy, is he going to light that fucker up? 
[02:34:30]  That's slowing it down feature.  Wow.  Is he going to Mexico?  I like it.  It's really fucking cool.  Yeah, the Deadeye is a lot of fun.  Yeah, I want to get him over the border.  I want to hear the fucking Spanish.  Are you in Mexico?  This is Mexico.  Oh, you are in.  I'm sorry.  You got any sniper type missions?  Yep, there is a sniper weapon.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, a little crosshairs there.  Oh, that guy ran away.  Bastards.  He's trying to get him with the crosshairs. 
[02:35:00]  Oh!  Wow.  Just took his head off.  That's fantastic.  Right through the crosshairs.  Slow motion.  The guy's head exploded.  In slow motion.  Oh, is that great?  Wow.  So, this just looks like fun.  The other thing that we did with all the characters in the game, the ambient characters in the world, they don't just sort of walk in circles.  They have lives.  So, Anthony's character will wake up, leave his house, go to the gun shop, and then characters, you know, at quitting time, will head off to the saloon or whatever, do some gambling and drinking, and then their character, as the sun goes down, will go home and go to sleep. 
[02:35:30]  And you can watch this happen in the game if you're in the right area.  You'll watch him walk home.  Yeah.  I mean, if you really want to follow a person around for the day and then watch him.  Without the temptation to blast him in the head at some point.  Exactly.  In his mundane day.  A lot of phone calls, Laszlo.  All right.  Any Easter eggs?  Yes. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Anything you want to talk about?  There are Easter eggs.  Well, there's a few show Easter eggs in there, I'll say.  When you go into the general store, pay special attention to some of the brands of stuff.  Including, in fact, I had a t-shirt made of one of my very favorite.  Was the, um.  Oh, my God.  What does it say?  It's the Peterson and Connor Junior Safety Bicycle Mounted Rifle.  Peterson and Connor. 
[02:36:30]  Holy shit.  There's newspapers in the game that you can buy.  You'll see somebody selling them in the thoroughfare that sort of tell you what's happening and give you clues on stuff that's coming up.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of cool articles that we wrote in there based on real articles from the time about, like, you know, the health benefits of smoking and stuff like that.  But there's a lot of the sort of the fake brands and things in there.  Also, as you're riding, as it gets sort of twilight in the game and you're riding along, you'll see some guys sitting around a campfire. 
[02:37:00]  And they'll say, hey, you know, if you want to sit down and hang out.  And so your character, you can make Marcin go sit down.  And one of them will start telling campfire stories.  And there's a few Easter eggs in some of those campfire stories.  Campfire stories.  What about, are you guys ever going to do one involved in a plane or hijacking?  Because with the graphics, you guys could do an amazing piece with that.  It would be about an hour-long game, wouldn't it?  What?  Because you hijacked the plane and you just smashed it into the ground.  Well, no, but I mean, as an element. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, look, I won.  I'm dead.  As an element.  As an element of the game.  So this is, so Jim Norton's idea for a game is called Jihad.  Jihad, what is this?  Jihad!  You know what?  Different ways of terrorism, yeah.  In the GTA games, you get in the air.  You get in the air and do some stuff.  I'm just thinking how cool it would be to be sucked out of a plane with these graphics.  You got a hot air balloon in this?  Yeah, you're blasting.  1910, 1911, they had hot air balloons?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I don't think we...  No hot air balloons.  No hot air balloons.  They had them. 
[02:38:00]  That's going to ruin sales right there.  Like France had them in the 1700s.  See, I want to go on a long ride on a horse, and I want to get in a hot air balloon for a little while.  Just kind of hang out.  Check out the horizon.  People asking, is it ever going to be available for PC?  I don't know.  Most of our games that we release end up going to PC, but they haven't told me anything.  Yeah.  Typically, you try to release it on platforms that aren't pirated through the nose and try to make your money back first. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, there you go.  That's smart, yeah.  Well, that's why, yeah.  Wow, look at this.  Well, you can't because it's radio once again.  Is Pirate Bay still fucking stealing shit, or have they been shut down, effectively?  No, I think Pirate Bay's still around.  Not for a long ride, man.  I think they have gotten it.  I think they have to go legit like Napster did.  That never works, though.  Yeah.  No one ever goes there.  When Napster went legit, everybody was like, boo.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, I'm never going to Napster again.  Right.  It's like somebody showed up at the party with a bunch of non-alcoholic beer.  Great.  Awesome.  Thanks a lot.  What a fucking buzzkill that was for all of us. 
[02:39:00]  Is this one of those plunger dynamite things you got going here?  Yes.  Wow.  All right.  You can set dynamite and wait for a little wagon.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  You are blowing up some of these motherfuckers.  Somebody sent me on Twitter why one of the characters' names is Bonnie McFarlane.  Oh, shit.  Which I had nothing to do with, honestly.  Are you kidding me?  I swear to God.  She's riding her husband.  No, I did not. 
[02:39:30]  Can you blow up that whole bridge?  I don't believe you can.  Some destructible.  I'm having bad luck pointing out all the stuff you can't do.  I know.  I'm sorry.  But Obi wants to get in a hot air balloon.  I do.  For a faggoty game.  Just hang out.  Right.  That would be cool, though, to have somebody dangling by the neck from a hot air balloon.  As long as it has a 360, you know, if I could turn 360 degrees around, that would be nice.  Right. 
[02:40:00]  Listen to a little Kenny G.  What kind of fucking gamer you wouldn't have played?  Kenny G.  Can you go in the water and swim?  You're not a very good swimmer in this game.  But you do have to cross the river to get into Mexico.  See?  That's cool.  Man, he goes.  Is he going to Mexico now?  I think he's in Mexico.  Yeah, we're in Mexico right now.  Yeah, hence the music.  The music kind of changes to where you are.  Yeah, I heard the little Mexican music playing there.  And also what they did, we hired composers that took a lot of instruments from the period,  and they composed basically what are stems, like really long stems of music. 
[02:40:30]  So there's no, we didn't license any cowboy music.  We didn't license any Johnny Cash.  Oh, really?  No, it's all scored.  No Bon Jovi, I'm a cowboy.  Right.  On a steel horse I ride.  It's scored, and what the game will do is it will fly in those musical stems based on  what's going.  So if you come over a ridge, and there's a bunch of bad guys, it'll start flying in stems  of music to make it tense.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, like a movie would.  Yeah, that's really cool.  So it feels a lot more cinematic.  You got your own version of Ecstasy of Gold in this movie? 
[02:41:00]  No.  I hope he fails again.  Yeah.  Why don't you ask him some other things?  Did you guys have a DeLorean in this film?  I'm keeping it.  How about Mets hats?  I'm keeping it within the time period.  Uh-oh.  What do we got going on now?  See, these Mexicans, I don't know.  The Mexicans took a woman.  Jesus Christ.  Do you deal with any engines?  You sure this isn't?  There are Native Americans in the game, but it's, you know, they're pretty much off the  reservation. 
[02:41:30]  By 1910.  By 1910.  We already fucking crucified most of them at that point, right?  We already showed them who was who.  Exactly.  We were the first terrorist men.  We stopped all their misbehaving.  Yeah.  Yes.  I love seeing those t-shirts, and they sell them in Union Square and all over the place that  say, you know, the original Homeland Security, and I was like, yeah, that's really comforting  because they did a great fucking job.  They got mowed over.  First people that showed up.  Right.  That was it.  Exactly.  First people that showed up.  They were lopping each other's fucking scalps off. 
[02:42:00]  Yes.  Oh, the Gatling gun.  That's great.  Well, I think this game's going to sell a few copies.  Yeah, I like this.  It's out already, right?  Yeah, it came out Tuesday.  Tuesday?  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  That's great, man.  Red Dead Redemption.  I am going home, popping this in.  Although I do have to speak with my accountant before he...  Oh, damn. 
[02:42:30]  That's right.  What did you do?  I got an appointment with my accountant.  I made an appointment with my accountant today.  Oh, is that where you go in the room and just roll around in the money?  Yeah, yeah.  And we laugh.  And the guy says, wow, 100 still can't wrap around your fat cock.  Ant's got a cock that's girthier than a bill.  But I'm going to want to play that.  Maybe he can discuss things while I'm playing this.  Well, and we also...  Really setting it up.  We also have the guy down the hall that wants to talk to us after the show today, too. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, but I have an accountant meeting, so it's got to be quick.  Well, you tell him that.  And I have pool people over.  You tell him that.  Well, I will.  I know you will.  All right, well, we'll continue with Lazlo.  We're going to take a break.  You got a sand bow in front of you?  Yeah.  That's not nice.  So we'll let Lazlo...  Yeah, it's one studio over.  Oh, my God.  Lazlo, can we do some tech stuff after the break, even though you're not...  I didn't bring anything, but I'll...  Basic shit.  We'll talk about stuff like the iPad, which I have. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, we'll talk...  Yeah.  Do you hear about the iPad yet?  Why don't we take a break?  We'll continue with Lazlo.  All right, so we got Lazlo in studio.  We got Forrest.  He's playing Red Dead Redemption as we speak here.  And I was asking Lazlo, catching up a little bit, and it's vacation time.  This is his last stop before he goes on vacation.  So I go, where are you going?  He says Croatia.  Yeah.  I like places with unexploded shells on the ground so that you can encourage children to  walk towards them.  Why not the Caribbean, Lazlo? 
[02:44:00]  Throw toys out in the minefield.  Why not the Caribbean?  I don't know.  Hang out, just, you know, get a tan, drink some fruity drinks, mellow out.  The Mediterranean's nice, man.  They got, you know, like, good cheese.  There's good hash over there.  Why did you decide Croatia?  Because of the good hash?  No.  No, I mean, you know, just talking to when I was in Turkey last year.  Istanbul?  Yes.  Me and you, brother.  I was there. 
[02:44:30]  It's a pretty dope town.  You go to the Blue Mosque?  I did go to the Blue Mosque.  Where they have all sorts of rules.  It needed the money!  You can't go in with your shoes, eh?  No?  Yeah, you gotta take your shoes off.  I'm not going.  Take your shoes off.  And they have all sorts of rules.  Did you see the beard hair of Muhammad?  Yes.  The one strand of hair?  Yes.  And people line up for hours?  Dude.  Are you bullshitting me?  Because I did it.  It's nuts.  Behind the really thick glass?  One lousy hair, and people line up for hours to see this thing.  It's, uh, and also, it's weird. 
[02:45:00]  We were walking around that town in the afternoon, and all of a sudden, these weird horns go off,  and this guy on the horn goes,  It's like, whoa.  What is it, like the call to prayer thing?  Infantata or something.  Yeah, it's like a...  And wherever you go, they try to sell you a damn rug.  Yeah.  Did you buy them?  No, I, no, I...  Who wants to haul a fucking rug on a plane?  Right.  Wherever you go, they try to...  You can buy a rug in New York.  And a lot of poor people coming up to you, running up to you, just trying to get whatever  they can from you. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, the food in Turkey is fantastic, but the people look like there's been a nuclear  apocalypse, and they've lived.  I mean, just, like, hard, rotund, scraggly motherfuckers.  Scary.  Yeah.  Really scary.  Yeah.  I mean, the Turks are no fucking around.  You can imagine them a few hundred years ago wearing animal skins and slitting your fucking  throat.  Yeah.  We were walking around in a little, I don't know, like a little flea market type area.  They had a whole bunch of stuff for sale.  And I see George Hamilton walk by.  That's a true story.  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing in the middle of Istanbul in the, like, almost like 
[02:46:00]  the ghetto area.  I don't know.  Getting a tan.  But you went recently to Istanbul?  I went last year, yeah.  See, I went before 9-11.  I would be scared to go there, you know, now.  No, you know...  Because, I mean, they got the hardcore Muslims there, all covered up and everything.  Well, but it's a secular country, so nobody fucks with you.  Yeah.  I mean, it's...  I mean, they do have a border that they share with Iraq, and I was told don't get very near  there.  Don't get close to there.  And I flew out of an airport near there, and I was texting Anthony, because when you 
[02:46:30]  drive into the airport, it literally looks like something out of fucking Raiders of the  Lost Ark.  Wow.  I mean, it's just military...  There was anti-aircraft guns as you drive into the airport.  Wow.  I was like, well, this is fucking relaxing.  And then our plane is starting to taxi, and a MiG jumps in front of us and takes off in  front of us.  Wow.  I was like, brilliant.  So you weren't in Istanbul for two weeks.  You were in Turkey for two weeks.  Yeah.  So you traveled the southern border in the buses with the people.  Wow, really?  Yes, stinky. 
[02:47:00]  You weren't scared at all?  No.  I bet.  No.  Did you go to any of the islands?  No, I didn't.  But...  Because they got some beautiful islands.  It's like, you travel the southern coast there, and there's chapters of the Bible written  around that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Council of Lycia.  That's some old world stuff.  Old school shit.  Yeah.  There's right around there where Revelations was written.  My chick's like, you want to go check that out?  I'm like, you know, I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm all right.  I read the chapter.  Not a very uplifting book.  So you don't want to end up in prison there?  No.  Because we all know about Midnight Express. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What was the coolest thing you did in Turkey?  Snorkeling.  Actually.  Snorkeling with...  Because there's...  You could do that in the Caribbean.  No, because there was an earthquake a couple thousand years ago, and a lot of the ruins  sunk.  So you can actually snorkel through all sorts of crazy Greek and Roman ruins.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Why didn't you go the distance and do a little scuba diving?  Eh, I don't know.  It's more work to actually snorkel. 
[02:48:00]  You don't like diving?  No, I mean, I like free diving.  I'll go down 30 or 40 feet, but I just don't have an air tank.  Oh, you're that good?  Yeah.  How long could you stay underwater with a snorkel?  Um...  I mean, the snorkel means nothing.  Right.  I understand that, but...  I don't know.  Minute and a half?  Nah, come on.  Yeah.  That's damn impressive.  Flazlo's a surfer.  No, I know that.  So he's in the water a lot.  All right, so now Croatia.  Yeah, Croatia.  What are you going to do in Croatia?  I'm just going island hopping. 
[02:48:30]  Hop on these crazy ferries.  Did you know there was a lot of islands in Croatia?  Croatia?  I didn't know that.  I had no idea.  No.  It's right across from Italy, Croatia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be like...  Full of Croats.  Yeah, you can get...  You can basically get like a house on the beach for like $130 a night.  Really?  Yeah.  It's dope.  Per cheap.  Yep.  Is it a party town?  Don't know.  You don't know much about it?  No, I'm just going.  Laszlo's an adventurer.  I'm just selling you on that.  Yeah.  I'm like, Laszlo is...  He goes to all... 
[02:49:00]  He just travels the globe.  I go to the same goddamn islands every year in the Caribbean.  I gotta start doing something different.  I'm...  One of these days, I want to take that field trip to Germany.  Laszlo's been to Germany quite a few times, so...  I've put together a tour.  Quite the itinerary.  That Anthony and I are going to take together.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  So you're going to fly Lufthansa?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you really going to do this someday?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We've got the whole agenda together.  We've just got to coordinate our schedules.  Yeah, I want to take that time off and go there. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, book it and do it.  Go to Germany.  So you're ready for a vacation, huh?  Oh, dude.  Yeah, I mean like...  You've been nonstop with this game now.  I mean, dude, the guys at Rockstar San Diego are taking like a month off.  Well fucking deserved.  Wow.  People have been working like bastards to make this game come out.  Just shut the doors, lock them, and say, we'll be back in a month.  Right.  Leave us alone.  By the way, thanks on the congratulations.  Oh, dude.  That's...  Yeah.  I appreciate it.  Yeah.  Good.  Oh, yeah.  You had a baby.  Yes, I did.  I'm sorry. 
[02:50:00]  I was...  And last night I said, you know, I should definitely thank Obi for having a child.  And then I came in and all I heard from Steve C. down the hall is about the glories and trials  of parenthood three weeks in.  Yes.  Steve, three weeks in.  I had my first.  Don't be ripping me off.  See, Steve is being the guy I don't want to be.  I'm not bragging.  I'm not showing a million pictures.  I'm not bringing the kid in here.  I'm not like telling people how great it is. 
[02:50:30]  I'm just going with the flow.  Yeah.  And I bring little tidbits to the show when I think it might be interesting to people.  That's it.  That's me.  Yeah.  Well, but are you officially done with your past life?  Well, you didn't really hang out with your friends before anyway.  So, I mean, because that's what happens when people have kids.  They just sort of...  Well, yeah, kind of.  They take the train to Laneville for 18 years.  And then after that, they start swinging.  You're going to start swinging?  No.  The train to Laneville and then swinging. 
[02:51:00]  That's fantastic.  I, uh...  No, I mean, I'm an old father.  I'm that guy.  I did it all.  I'm in a good place right now.  I'm happy.  Real happy, actually.  That's great.  Yeah.  What can I tell you?  It's getting really warm and fuzzy in here.  Can we...  I know.  Were you Laszlo ever?  Nah.  Make it sound like you climbed Everest.  Yeah.  Well, it kind of feels like that sometimes.  I am.  I am.  No, I mean, I've done...  I've done it all.  I'm through.  Right.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  How many years do we just spend with our asses in this chair telling dick jokes? 
[02:51:30]  Well, that's the problem.  I mean, if we could, like, lighten up the schedule a little bit, maybe we can.  We can get some more adventures in.  Get some adventure, like Laszlo.  Into our lives.  All over the world.  Yeah.  No, I mean, I'm not done with exploring and all that shit, but, you know, I mean, I'm at  a good place, so let's move on.  See, this is the type of thing Steve would get excited about and talk about for another  20 minutes.  This is my priority now.  Food and men.  Yeah.  I'm a gatherer.  It's great.  You know, we were watching Forrest. 
[02:52:00]  You can go hunt in Red Dead, and he was chasing a bear.  He sure was.  Yeah, and the bear was kicking his ass for a little bit.  Now, this town looks a little different.  Is this more like one of the first, quote, cities?  Yes.  You know what I mean?  Like, this is more modern.  More modern.  Yeah, it's more of sort of a Kansas City, Chicago kind of vibe.  It's more in the northeastern section of the map.  Yeah, look at that.  But there's kind of a uniform cop-looking thing, and then some telegraph wires and gas lamps  and things like that, as opposed to the real kind of skanky old west towns. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Cobblestone streets.  And then we came across a camp that was filled with hermits, you were telling us?  Oh, it was a cannibal.  There was a guy.  Yeah, one guy is a cannibal.  There was a guy sitting there eating some people that he had come across, and then he tries to eat you.  Wow.  Yes.  It just never ends.  Yeah, the bear scene was great.  It took a while to take down the bear.  Right. 
[02:53:00]  People in town don't like you.  Wow.  Hey, Laszlo, while we have you here, maybe a little tech talk.  I know you're not prepared for it, but you're always on the up and up.  I was never prepared for it when I was prepared for it anyway.  Anthony got the iPad yesterday or a couple days ago.  You said he wanted it, and he finally got it.  No, it was a gift.  It was a gift from the wonderful people at Mohegan Sun.  Yeah, well, you send that back and say, I don't want the iPad.  They sent me an iPad.  I'm not going to send it back.  Send it back and say, look, I want something else.  I don't like the iPad.  Is it branded?  No, it just showed up. 
[02:53:30]  I registered it under my name and everything, and there it is.  I have an iPad.  Laszlo's giving you that look.  You're not a fan of the iPad, Laszlo?  No, I think having a large iPhone is awesome.  I've been futzing around with it, and I do like reading web pages off of it.  That's really cool.  I can do it on my computer, obviously, but to be able to kind of just lean back on the couch, 
[02:54:00]  dude, boom, you got your pages, boom, your copy, and scroll through websites, it's just easier than a mouse for some stupid reason.  I love hearing a gunfight going on while you're describing it.  It's perfect.  These guys are being mowed down.  He just shot a cop in the knees and feet.  Like, I like that.  The game apps are a lot better to play on it because it's bigger.  It's just a lot more fun that way.  I've been playing this game called Cogs, and, you know, you got to fucking move cogs and steam pipes around to make things work. 
[02:54:30]  It gives you a little thing like get the big wheel to turn, and you got to figure out the puzzle.  Like, I like puzzle games like that.  That's kind of cool.  But the video is great.  Yeah, the video looks amazing.  I have Netflix on it.  So the other day, I was in bed the other night, and I just popped on Fargo to see what it looks like.  You had to hold it the whole time, though.  No, you know what I did?  Or did you prop it up against a pillow or something? 
[02:55:00]  I kind of just put my comforter and bunched it up and just leaned it against there.  I'm laying down sideways watching it, and it sounded great.  I'm streaming from Netflix.  I got my Kindle, so I'm happy.  Yeah, and it's got, you know, book reader.  Yeah, the nice thing about the iPad, though, is it came just in time to make the book publishers back off.  Yeah.  Because they were getting really moody with Amazon and the Kindle. 
[02:55:30]  Because, and this is what's always frustrated me about books, books should not cost $28 or whatever the fuck when a book comes out.  It's ridiculous.  And so Amazon, like Apple, said, you know, we're going to sort of set some of the structure here.  You know, books should be like $14, $10, $7.  Uh-oh, Jimmy's getting mad.  And the publishers pushed back.  But then the iPad came along, and, you know, they're going for the same sort of revenue model as well, which I think it's great. 
[02:56:00]  I mean, electronic books, I'm really not all that into them, but why?  There is less production cost, though.  Like, if you do an electronic book, I mean, the cost of producing books, there's no cost to electronics.  Actually, they should charge less for them because you're not costing the same.  It's not a printer and, you know, binding.  You have to bind a book.  Yeah, or glue.  Make a spine.  Or shipping costs.  Yeah.  Or shelving costs.  One thing I don't like, though, it is very expensive to burn iPads, as you see horrible Jewish writings. 
[02:56:30]  It's very hard to throw them into a big pile.  Let's start an iPad burning.  iPad burning.  Why don't we do that?  Hopefully it'll set up some kind of situation where newspapers can actually make some money off their content because, you know, newspapers are going broke, which is a bad thing for journalism.  But that's the problem with the Kindle.  You can't get – they only have a few newspapers you can get. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  They don't really have a lot.  They really don't.  You know what, though?  You go to fucking –  I don't know why.  Various sites, and you really don't need the newspapers on the go.  I know, but you go to newspaper websites, and a lot of the news sites just aggregate from newspapers.  It's like somebody's got to go research and write those stories.  Yeah, that is true.  They've got to figure out how to get out of that paper thing and just have electronics.  I mean, you're going to still get the poor old bastards that's going to be, where's my newspaper? 
[02:57:30]  Well, I would like to know why some of these newspapers haven't embraced the Kindle and the iPad.  Because they're run by people that are 115 years old.  It's a fad.  I mean, we used to live in Boston, and, you know, every once in a while I want to read the Boston Herald.  Last I checked, they don't have it available for the Kindle.  I would fucking just download that every once in a while, and they would make my money.  Yeah, you'd pay for it?  Yeah, it's like 25, the ones they have there, it's like 25 cents, 50 cents, whatever it is. 
[02:58:00]  It's nothing.  But that would add up for these guys.  And people have become accustomed to everything on the internet being for free, and I don't think it's going to last forever.  No.  Because people have got to make money somehow.  Though, have you noticed that you can't watch dick-all on, like, any videos anymore without having to sit through a goddamn 30-second commercial?  You're so frustrated.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And you used to be able to just drag and fast-forward it, and not any longer.  They have the countdown clock, though, to keep you in there. 
[02:58:30]  You can't mute it, you can't slide it, you can't do shit.  Your video will start in 17 seconds.  Great, thanks.  And how long before it's a lot longer than that?  Yeah.  You know, they could run, if you want to see a video bad enough, they could run commercials like they do on a TV show.  They're experimenting.  It's kind of like your theory, Ant, they're just turning on the heat.  Yeah, turn up the heat a little bit.  See how much we're going to take.  See how much these people will take, and then we'll be like, fuck them.  One of those freaking videos that goes viral, why not put five minutes in front of it? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, you'll sit there, or you'll get up and walk away like you do on TV.  Yeah, but it's hard to find an advertiser that wants to put their commercial on the front of somebody sitting on a glass jar and breaking it with their asshole.  It's not the preparation age.  It's not the only viral video, Laszlo.  But let's be honest.  That's what I love about advertisers.  They're like, you know, we really, let's create a viral video that gets passed around.  It's like, unless somebody's getting fist fucked.  Yeah, no one wants to see it.  Or they're blowing a horse.  They're not going to pass around your stupid fake viral video that you made. 
[02:59:30]  And they always look fake, right?  A stone kid coming home from the dentist.  That's pretty funny.  And a little English kid getting his finger bitten.  Charlie.  Charlie.  Oh, Charlie.  That hurt.  Why that is so funny is beyond me.  I never saw it.  But it is so fucking funny.  It's one of the most classic viral videos of all time.  The guy that punched the black kid on the bus.  Black kid?  That guy was 51.  Oh, was he?  Yes.  The black guy was 51. 
[03:00:00]  The Oakland thing?  Yeah.  That was an old man.  The guy that punched him, he's driving him crazy.  He's getting all these phone calls from racists across the nation.  Like, good job, man.  Yeah, you done did good.  You did.  So, he's been having a very stressful life since that incident.  He tried to shave his beard off.  He was also getting harassed by some black groups.  Really?  Yes.  Because he beat a guy up who was talking shit?  So, you do realize you live in America, right, Jimmy? 
[03:00:30]  I mean, people just have a problem with that type of thing.  I mean, you're right, but.  The guy was giving him shit and he got his comeuppance.  He got his comeuppance.  That big old man.  Got what was coming to him.  Whatever.  All right.  What else you got in tech?  Anything?  Not to put you on the spot, but anything that's.  Where are we going with the phone technology?  Is it always going to be about the iPhone or are we going to have some legitimate choices out there? 
[03:01:00]  It's interesting to me to see Verizon actually trying to battle the iPhone.  And there's a lot of people that love that droid.  Yeah.  But, I mean, Verizon for so long, their operating systems and their phones were completely frustrating  because you couldn't do anything from the outside world in it.  Yeah.  Which is, you know, as much as people hate the iPhone, they at least broke that fucking mentality  and said, you know what?  Let people develop apps.  Let them surf the net.  You know, don't nickel and dime them for every bit that they download. 
[03:01:30]  Right.  And I think, you know, consumers are a lot better for it.  But, I wonder, are people really developing apps for the droid versus the iPhone?  And the droid is now, they're claiming that they've got a bigger install base than the iPhone.  Really?  Which I don't see how that could be.  I can't even believe that.  A bigger what?  Install base.  Yeah, I don't, uh.  The droid's popular, though.  I have the iPhone app. 
[03:02:00]  My iPhone app, I've gotten a lot of requests for the droid.  That's the one people are like, get one for the droid, get one for the droid.  They almost go fuck themselves.  I can't.  Tell me to get a goddamn, uh.  No.  iPhone.  No.  What does your iPhone app do?  Everything!  Really?  Can I do my finances in there?  I'd prefer it if you did.  No, it's actually just to, you know, to connect to me and, you know, my dates and all that  stuff and Twitter.  It's insane now.  It's all about you.  Of course.  But does it entertain me as an app?  I don't know.  It's a buck.  What do you want?  You're really selling this, Jim.  It's got ringtones and sounds and stuff like that. 
[03:02:30]  People usually charge for ringtones.  They get like 16 ringtones for free.  So fuck the whole world.  Fuck them all.  Can I please read a, uh, instant feedback from a dummy, Anthony?  Please.  Oh.  Please.  Matt in Virginia.  Hey, Ope.  Since when is 132 newspapers and 75 U.S. newspapers available for the Kindle?  Not that many.  Sorry they're missing one Boston newspaper you want.  You want.  Try the Boston Globe, which is on there.  No.  I want to read the Boston Herald and that's why I have a problem with the amount of newspapers  that are available for the Kindle, you dope. 
[03:03:00]  Try the Phoenix.  If I wanted to read the Boston Globe, I would have said I want to read the Boston Globe.  I want the fucking Boston Herald for the Kindle.  That's the one I used to read.  You'll get the Boston Globe and like it.  Now, the Boston Globe is too highbrow.  Yeah, that is.  That's like the New York Post.  Too highbrow.  What?  It's like their version of the New York Times.  It's like the New York Times and the New York Post.  Is highbrow to you where they actually put in parentheses how to pronounce the things?  It's any newspaper that has the columnist's picture done in stipple print. 
[03:03:30]  Stipple?  Yeah, that's where it looks like they're drawn in little dots.  I would have just said in dots.  It's called stipple.  Why do you have to say stipple and make us all look stupid?  He likes to make us all look stupid.  Don't squeeze the shaman to Mr. Stipple.  No.  Oh, Chip, that was Mr. Whipple.  Any other tech stuff there, Laszlo?  You're done with that.  You're retired, man.  You just want to go to Croatia. 
[03:04:00]  Are you leaving for the airport right after this?  No.  I'm going on Ron and Fez for a bit and then heading to Croatia.  Are you really?  Yeah.  But what?  Here we go.  We were just talking about that.  He's vacationing to Croatia.  He's going there for a couple weeks.  War-torn country?  Good vibe?  He figured two legs.  I don't need them.  Jimmy doesn't really go on vacations.  Not to fucking, not places in the middle of a civil war.  No.  That was a few years ago.  Who are you going with?  My chair.  Does she want to go there?  Yeah.  Is she Croatian?  No. 
[03:04:30]  She's Polish.  He goes to crazy places.  He was in Turkey last year.  He does last year.  You're like Jonathan.  He manages like that.  He goes to nutty places.  No, listen, I don't go to, he goes to stupid places.  Yeah, like African, Somalia.  Who goes to Afghanistan?  That's insane.  Turkey can be scary.  Come on.  Yeah.  I know you're saying.  No, dude, you can go to, you can go to cities in Turkey that everybody's British.  The Brits have invaded the south of Turkey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's towns that.  Still remnants of the empire.  Yes.  It's all fish and chips. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they actually have tourism advertisements for Turkey here on TV.  I've seen them.  They don't have it for like, you know, Mogadishu, Somalia.  You never see a tourism spot for that.  Any place you have to get shots to go to.  Yeah, I don't like that whole getting shots and a lot of them.  Yeah.  Any place that 25% of the people have AIDS.  I don't go.  25%.  Right.  It's like 50 of them.  Exactly.  You're one step below that though, Laszlo.  What do you mean?  You're pretty close to going to places where you need shots. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Croatian.  Yeah.  Is it all put together?  No, it's a pretty civilized place.  No, you could get shot there.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, very civilized.  A member of the parliament is Mirko Krokop.  He's a member of the parliament.  Really?  He's a fucking MMA kickboxer.  Good.  Kick some ass.  Nice.  I had a, you know, in the midst of working on Red Dead for a while, I had a warrant out for  my arrest, which was kind of entertaining.  Really?  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  Which, the thing about having a warrant out for your arrest is it doesn't really hit home  until you're driving drunk.  Oh.  Because you're like, wow, this could end poorly.  Yeah, I'm really taking a chance.  Because you think sometimes if you've got a bit of a buzz on in your driving, like, you  know, I may be able to talk my way out of this, or he won't smell that I stink like  a fucking six pack of tall boys.  But as soon as he runs that fucking driver's license and sees that you've got a warrant,  you're dunsy.  Like to be a problem.  Out of the vehicle, sir.  Yeah.  Because, well, I was supposed to go to some court dates, but we had to work late on the 
[03:06:30]  game, so I kind of missed them.  They get a bit moody about that.  Yeah, you're not supposed to miss those.  Why'd you have to go to court, though?  Or you don't want to say.  Well, I was sort of fighting, I got into an argument with an enforcement officer type  person.  Oh my God.  Fight as long?  Well, no, I was, no, not a fight.  Oh my God.  Yeah, it was sort of the, in Long Beach, they've got these cops that aren't really cops, but  they can issue things that get you in a lot of trouble. 
[03:07:00]  Trustees?  Yeah.  So, you know.  Those dumb tickets for doing dumb things?  Yeah, it was like, I was running with my dog, and he said, you know, you can't have your  dog on the beach, and then I sort of said some things about his line of work and how  much he makes, and next thing you know, he's calling me in on the radio and citing me for  a bunch of shit.  The problem is that you're calling the real cops.  Yeah.  That's what's so frustrating.  And instead of paying it, I'm like, I'm going to go fight that.  I'm going to make his fat ass show up in court. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  And then my fat ass fucking didn't go to court.  Hasla.  I live right on the Hudson River, right?  And they have a pier, and you do a lot of bike riding up and down the river, and there's  this long, long pier where you want to go out in the middle of the Hudson River, basically.  I was riding my bike on there once, and all hell broke loose.  I'm like, what's the problem with being on your bike?  And that's what I love.  The people that are citing you for exercising are always fat fucks.  See, it's just like... 
[03:08:00]  I wasn't even riding my bike hard.  It's easier to just stay on the seat instead of walk your bike.  And I was probably going the exact same speed if I was walking my bike.  Oh, but this woman, who just loves her authority and her power...  And probably had an ass you could show a fucking movie on.  Had to make my life a living hell, and then she's giving me an extra ticket because I don't  have ID on me.  Because you're supposed to have ID on you at all times.  Oh, you are.  So I had two.  Two pink fucking citations.  Yeah, I didn't have ID on me.  That's the other thing that bugs me. 
[03:08:30]  You don't have ID.  Yeah, I don't fucking carry ID with me.  Well, what if you're Mexican?  Keep going.  We're almost there.  Kick out.  Gotta carry your papers.  So is the dog incident over with?  Well, yeah.  I sort of paid money to make it go away.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, it works.  But you shouldn't have been in that predicament to begin with.  I know.  Because what the fuck was your dog doing on the beach?  Really?  Bothering who?  Exactly.  But then, you know, I'd be driving home after a party or something, and I'm like, man, fuck 
[03:09:00]  it.  I got a warrant out for my arrest.  I'm driving drunk.  And then you start humming Johnny Cash songs and shit, and you're like, yeah, I kind of  feel like a badass right now.  Oh, no.  You're like, no, this is going to end with me paying a lot of fucking money through the  nose.  That's when you just put on cruise control.  Cruise control?  Take a nap?  Get in the right lane.  Yeah.  And just drive the speed limit.  No weaving.  Cruise control?  Don't be silly.  That's a little dangerous. 
[03:09:30]  Why?  Because then you're thinking, eh, I don't have to pay too much attention right now.  No, no, no, no.  Cruise control is to take care of the speed.  Now, there's one less thing you've got to think of.  So now you can just concentrate on your surroundings and keeping the wheel straight.  Yeah.  You ever do that one where you close your right eye?  If you have to close one eye, you are way too far gone.  You're in trouble.  I have never had to close one eye.  I can't remember the last time I had to close an eye.  I swear.  Because that is way out of bounds.  Close one eye and roll all the windows down. 
[03:10:00]  I've had to roll the windows down just to stay awake.  Yeah.  You know, just stay awake.  But, yeah, if you're closing one eye because you're seeing double, you should not be in  that car, man.  Oof.  I mean, there's a difference between blowing a .09, which technically is drunk.  And thinking two officers are harassing you and it's only one.  Yeah, hey, what the fuck are you doing?  You blow a .09 or .08, .09, which is legally drunk, you can function. 
[03:10:30]  Believe me.  It is no problem.  But if you're fucking around with a .15, .17, shit like that, now you're into that, you  should not be fucking driving.  I still think the legal limit should be .1.  I don't think it should be .08.  .08 is too fucking low.  It's a couple of beers on an empty stomach.  Yeah.  You got a little buzz on?  You're feeling good.  You're kind of happier.  But it's not impairing your judgment to fucking get from the brake to the gas and the gas 
[03:11:00]  to the brake and just stop it.  Stop it.  .08 to .1.  Why did they do that anyway?  Yeah, it's one of those things.  I think the Federales got involved and said, if you want your fucking highway money.  That's the way they always do it.  Yeah.  Oh, you could set your speed limit at 100.  We don't care.  By the way, no federal highway funding.  So you're pretty much muscling, you mob tactics, to keep me doing what you want me to do.  Oh, states have their rights.  Yeah, state rights?  Yeah, that's fine.  But we're not going to give you any of the federal money. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, thanks.  Great.  Fuck yourself.  Yeah, that car doesn't have a horse attached to it in the game.  What's good?  What is that?  I think it's in the front.  Oh, yeah.  You just can't see it.  There's no horse.  Oh, no, it isn't.  It's a fucking horseless carriage.  It is.  Holy shit, you can almost hear the engine, yeah.  I haven't seen this mission.  Is this toward the end of the game?  Hold on, hold on.  Wow.  Go ahead for us.  This is later in the game. 
[03:12:00]  It's...  You're in a truck in the modern city.  Yeah, so you're in the bed of the truck with the gatling gun.  Yeah, there's a...  Oh, they're throwing fire at you.  Oh, you just got clipped.  It's really not good to encourage people to drive drunk.  No, no, no.  They got to figure it out for themselves.  But .08.  Good.  And, dude, the days of the punishment being you had to pour your beer out in front of them.  God damn, I miss those. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Pour your beer out.  Oh, come on, man.  Yeah.  You'd argue that one.  Yeah.  We just bought these.  Come on.  Sorry, but right when Bud Ice came out, you know, I was like, come on.  This stuff costs extra.  It's a Bud Ice.  It's ice brewed, which I don't understand, because brewing beer, you're boiling it, but  whatever the fuck.  Can I just finish this one?  Yeah, exactly.  I'll go right home.  What happened to Bud Ice?  I don't know.  Still around?  I don't think so.  Maybe in some places.  I, uh, yeah.  For the most part, I don't think so. 
[03:13:00]  And I've said it a thousand times.  They should have the drunk driving license, where you, you take a special, they could  charge you money, whatever they need to do, where you take a special road test, where  you drink, they breathalyze you, and you drive through a course, and then your license  has a rating of what alcohol, blood alcohol level you are legally allowed to drive with,  as opposed to, because some people react to alcohol a lot different than others.  Yeah, sometimes they just take their panties off.  So, exactly, and other people are fine and dandy at all kinds of levels. 
[03:13:30]  So what you do is, it's this thing, it costs a lot of money, so that, and you could ride  through, drive through it, uh, and, and you keep blowing into the breathalyzer, the higher  it gets, whatever, as long as you're able to get through the course, and then your stamp,  your license is stamped with a, you know, .12, let's say.  And then if you get pulled over and you're .1, you're free to go, because you're good for  a .12.  Now are you hoping a legislator's gonna take you up on this?  Who the fuck would commit career, political career suicide to push in that legislation? 
[03:14:00]  And another thing, I'm on a low of the age of consent.  Now that I like, too.  That's a good one.  That's a really crummy idea.  Jimmy!  That's crummy.  Why don't you like it?  You're a killjoy.  I like how Ann is trying to do anything other than not drink and drive.  Why don't they just make rubber clothes to put people in, so if I hit them, they bounce?  Exactly.  Bubble wrap.  Pumper cars for everyone, right?  Whatever happened to your I'm not drinking thing? 
[03:14:30]  Because when I was over your house last year, you were drinking.  Oh, yeah.  Well, no.  During the week, I'm very good.  And what is it about when people quit stuff?  They always gotta tell you.  You know what?  I'm not smoking.  I don't give a fuck, dude.  Tell me when you're smoking again.  Right.  You know, I haven't had a drink in two days.  I don't care.  Stop pushing your problems on me.  No, during the week is...  Because working out, it's very difficult to work out and drink.  So that, you know...  And it defeats its own purpose.  No, it defeats its purpose.  The purpose. 
[03:15:00]  But the weekends are still...  Woo-hoo!  Yay!  Are you drinking more on weekends to make up for the fact you're not drinking during the week?  Exactly!  That's usually what happens, right?  And now the house is being summarized.  Yes.  Summarization is...  The rotating bastions of hooahs coming through.  Yes!  That's what we need.  Rotating hooahs.  I love when I text Anthony and three days later I text him again and I'm like, did you get  my message?  He's like, you know, it gets mixed in with whore email.  With whore mail. 
[03:15:30]  I have whore mail coming in.  And I was thinking like...  You got whore mail.  Right.  I started to get offended and I was like, wait a second.  If I'm getting email, a text from whores and I see something come in from Anthony, I'm  like, whatever, dude.  No.  Laszlo will always get through.  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me see.  Uh-huh.  Ah!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Yeah.  Oh, Ange.  No, the pool guys didn't come yesterday.  They're supposed to come today.  I'll get them!  They were behind schedule because of the rain.  I shan't have it. 
[03:16:00]  I shan't have it!  When we, uh...  By the way, that sound that we're hearing, this is what it's like to be Anthony.  When you're just sitting there in the quiet, that's what you hear.  I didn't even know the game was on.  Wait a minute.  It's just background noise.  I thought it was my...  You know what?  I thought we talked about everything in this game.  I feel at home.  This is cool as hell, man.  It's underground in a mineshaft.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it's in a mine.  How cool is this?  Oh, that's cool.  It could be almost that labyrinth-y feeling.  Also...  Can you jump on one of those, uh...  What are they called? 
[03:16:30]  Mineshaft vehicles?  Yeah, you can.  Like Dr. Jones in Short Round?  Very nice.  There's also some nice multiplayer bits where you run through the mines.  Oh, that guy.  You shot the gun out of his hand and shot him in the chest.  Wow, very cool.  Look at that.  Oh, this guy's whimpering.  Up.  Well, he'll...  Red Dead Redemption.  Out now, PS3, Xbox 360.  Right.  Yes!  All right, Laszlo, should we get you out of here?  What do you want to do? 
[03:17:00]  Well, he's hanging out till, um...  I'll hang.  All right, you'll hang.  Maybe we'll do some other things after.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  I want to send a big F.U. to my dumb wife for thinking I'm fucking one of my friends,  which I haven't fucked yet, but I haven't fucking many other girls, you dumb cunt. 
[03:17:30]  Fuck you.  Next message.  I want to send a big F.U. to E-Rock because he's a little bitch, and he's never going to  get in shape enough to impress anyone.  Fuck you, E-Rock.  Stop being a pussy.  Next message.  What the fuck does a cleaning lady at work?  There's always cleaning the fucking bathroom.  Every time I got to take a piss on my break.  Fuck you.  Clean something else.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to my fucking cunt ex-girlfriend who had me divorce my wife and  leave my kids just so she could up and fucking leave me eight months later for some dipshit. 
[03:18:00]  So fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U.  is for the dumb motherfucker who went into my locker at the fucking gym and stole nothing  but my hat, my brand new fucking hat.  Fuck you, you dumb piece of shit.  There was $300 cash in my wallet and you took only my hat, you fucking idiot.  Next message.  I got a big, give a big F.U. to Sean the intern.  Holy fuck, man.  You're making us all look bad. 
[03:18:30]  You're a pathetic excuse for a man.  Fuck you.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like, through,  you know, the air satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever. 
[03:19:00]  Here's the thing.  But, I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really...  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  Oh.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but, like, I mean, did you get into your router  settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right here.  Yeah, exactly right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled. 
[03:19:30]  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean like a Cat 5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet cable?  Yeah, they call them...  I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need like a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just...  Let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up.  Okay.  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that...  Am I set for life?  Yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man.  No problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:20:30]  No, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine!  I'm up to my limit of friends, 5,000.  I'm not helping you with Facebook.  I think somebody set up a fan page.  I'm hanging out!  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on The Virus.  SiriusXL.  Hey, we're hanging with our old friend, Laszlo. 
[03:21:00]  Sorry about the Red Dead Redemption audio in the background during the commercials.  I think it made the commercials better.  Mars set up the studio differently today, I think, so I just assumed that wasn't going to bleed in.  Yeah, we were playing five-finger fillet in the game.  You know that game where you...  I guess I tried it after I saw Aliens, where you take the knife and you try to pop between your...  Between your fingers without hitting your finger again.  It always ends really poorly.  Yeah, yeah.  You do good right up until you don't. 
[03:21:30]  Pretty much what that game is.  Laszlo made some notes during the break.  Oh, yeah.  He wants to call out E-Rock and Sam, I'm here.  Sam better get his ass down here.  I mentioned the worst of the week countdown.  Now, the channel used to, on the weekends, have full shows.  But now we've got sort of the headline news, cliff notes version of the show, right?  Yeah.  By the way, you would think we would run our own channel.  We really don't.  Because if it was up to us, and I wish it was, we would have some fine live programming on the weekends. 
[03:22:00]  And you would be one of those shows, Laszlo.  I mean, that's no secret.  Patrice would be one of those shows, certainly.  Yes.  And a few others.  Bill Burr, if we could get him.  You know.  But I don't know.  They just don't want to spend money on any...  Oof.  Anybody.  Anybody.  I mentioned the...  Anybody.  I mentioned the worst of the week countdown, and Opie instantly said, yeah, we don't listen  to it.  I've never heard it.  The precisely... 
[03:22:30]  Here's the Opie and Anthony show.  I just ask Sam every once in a while.  Did it sound good?  He goes, yeah.  I'm like, all right.  That's good enough for me.  Starring Jim Norton.  Many fine bits during the week.  However, it's now become the best appearances of Sam and E-Rock, counted down.  Oh, boy.  Every week.  I will put any...  What?  What?  I'll put any worst of the week countdown lineup, and you tell me any bit that didn't appear  that should have appeared.  You can...  But it's obvious that none of the executive talent on the show votes on what gets put... 
[03:23:00]  But that was made clear, every show we say, Sam and E-Rock choose, because nobody else  bothers.  Bothers.  I mean, nobody wants to.  Laszlo, I would love to beat him up for that, but...  Nobody wants the job, so Sam and E-Rock get to...  They beat us down so much, it's better just to walk away from this place as quickly as  possible.  And then they introduce them, and they say, here's a really funny bit that stars both  me and E-Rock.  Yes!  So they're sabotaging this whole thing and turning it into the Sam and E-Rock channel. 
[03:23:30]  Is that what you're saying, Laszlo?  Yes.  There's no sabotage, but if E-Rock and Sam are going to do the weekend show for free,  it's going to be highlighting E-Rock and Sam.  Wait, the show for free, aren't you salaried?  It's to produce the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm not salaried as an air talent.  Yeah, they're always giving extra work out.  Producers produce air talent.  I have to defend them on that one, too.  But you're happy to do that faggoty air shift pop thing or whatever you're doing?  Yeah, because I'm on it.  Yeah, but you're on this, too.  Right, so I can put myself on it. 
[03:24:00]  Are you getting paid for that other thing?  No, but I can say whatever I want.  Well, you obviously say whatever you want on this, too.  Precisely.  But here's the other thing that they do when they introduce the bit, since you guys don't listen.  Yeah.  When they introduce, part of the joy of comedy is surprise.  You know, the amazing one-liners of Jim Norton.  These guys, before they play the clip, will tell you everything funny that happens in the fucking clip.  I have heard that.  I have heard that.  So basically what they're saying is, two Jews are approaching a bar, which is not a big deal since they are the owners. 
[03:24:30]  Hear the clip.  And then you're like, wait.  Yes.  All right, guys.  Exactly.  Why are you just staring at Jimmy, Laszlo?  No, because he was talking.  Oh, okay.  That's polite.  Yes.  But he understands what I'm saying.  Yes.  That's giving away the punchlines.  So giving away all the punchlines to the bits.  So you'll maybe have ten segments, and five of them, typically in the top five, are either E-Rock or you.  Well, I mean, since E-Rock and I are the ones voting, I personally feel like the ones that I'm involved in deserve to be right up there. 
[03:25:00]  But you guys are each $30,000-a-year talent, and these are million-dollar-a-year talents.  But they're on there, too.  But it's always about you, is what I'm saying.  You could make it about them.  Well, are you complaining?  What are you complaining about?  That they're not voting?  Complain to them.  Well, your job is not to push your agenda.  I personally hate countdowns.  I lost that battle.  I don't even want a countdown on this channel.  I really don't. 
[03:25:30]  I want live programming on the weekends, and I want the company to do the right thing and pay these guys,  because they're very talented and would keep the audience during the weekends.  Is your point, Laszlo, that you think that if Sam has...  I didn't care what the fuck I had to say, but that's okay.  That's not that I didn't care what you had to say.  It was just...  All right.  Sorry, guys.  Nothing.  So it starts Saturdays at 9 a.m. Eastern.  It's the worst of the week countdown.  See, what I see is...  Yes.  You put on this show...  Now, no one else wants to bother with the countdown aspect of it. 
[03:26:00]  I don't really care about the countdown thing.  I think number 10 is just as good as number 2, it's just as good as 5, 1, it doesn't matter.  Sure.  But, Laszlo does make a good point when he says that the over-explaining of the bit is a bit much.  I have heard that.  Well, we...  And the banter, the back-and-forth banter.  Do you want a countdown?  Yeah, we were asked to do this.  I wouldn't care.  Why don't you care?  No, I wouldn't care if it's a countdown or it's just...  But wouldn't it make more sense to keep live programming going during the weekends? 
[03:26:30]  Live programming would be the best, but we were doing that.  I know that's impossible.  It was successful, though.  I was going to say little shows.  That's not nice.  But these shows like Laszlo and Patrice were doing...  Yeah, but that's out of the question.  I would love to have that.  That's what I would love.  So what's the problem?  There's no one down the hall that wants to give any money.  So we have to do these countdown things.  And also, every other break, you're not giving their Twitters.  You're giving your Twitters.  Correct. 
[03:27:00]  Yes.  That's another thing.  And how come one of the promos switched our Twitters for yours?  Me and E-Rock like to play games.  Is that it?  They also joke about...  You can reach Anthony at...  And then it goes to, like, E-Rock's Twitter.  Well, they also joke about Steve getting fired every week.  Yeah, we call Steve gay, fat, and fired every week.  They're basically doing a show within a countdown show.  Exactly.  I think that's Laszlo's point.  Yeah.  That Twitter promo changed before Christmas.  That's been running.  So thanks for listening. 
[03:27:30]  E-Rock and me decided several months ago...  I'm glad Laszlo finally brought this up.  No, you're not.  ...that we were just going to start doing stuff until somebody told us to stop because...  It's really not the way...  Nobody's listening.  No, people are listening on the weekend.  And Eric and me get lots of compliments from fans when we ask.  Oh, do you?  Do you?  Absolutely.  So basically, you're saying...  I'd like to see some of those.  Well, I could print them out.  Oh, can you?  Yeah, Twitter responses.  Laszlo, you don't like the fact that Sam is technically correct.  That since they're voting, they get to choose. 
[03:28:00]  But you don't like the fact that just because he's voting doesn't mean it should be a self-promotion.  You're saying that he's taking advantage of the fact that he's voting.  I can tell that they're voting because it's the whole weekend's about Sam and E-Rock.  And a lot of times I'm busy during the week and I don't get to hear...  It's like, oh, great.  I get to hear another segment of Sam.  See, now, if that isn't what I think is or you think is really one of the top ten things,  maybe you're being a little biased because you're...  And here's a concept.  How about you let the fucking listening audience vote? 
[03:28:30]  Why don't you list the segments and let them vote?  Because we have to get it done.  We have to do it on Friday.  When are they going to vote?  And we didn't come up with the concept.  They can vote during the week.  But how are they going to vote for Friday?  What if Friday is the number one bit?  Sam's getting a little plucky.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Like you...  When we learned that you got a circumcision at the age of 19,  that's obviously going to be on the count.  It's obviously going to be on the countdown,  but after that bit plays the first time on our show, 
[03:29:00]  then people would...  You would know the bits people like  because the reaction would be pretty high, right?  So they could vote during the week.  Well, I mean, but something has to be set up for that.  Yeah.  That's out of our hands.  And there's no more website.  I've had a child.  You don't understand.  There's no time for websites and logos.  But now that you said that's not...  Salary diapers.  But isn't it somebody's job then to go,  well, that isn't set up.  That would be a good idea.  Let me go ahead and set that up.  I'm not a web designer. 
[03:29:30]  I can't design a whole.  I don't mean a web designer.  I mean, like, to say,  all right, we got to figure out  how the audience can give us their feedback  as to what is the best bid  or what they enjoyed the most  and get it to us.  Who would you approach with that problem?  How about approaching Twitter?  Obi does it all the time.  You'll see Obi tweet and say,  hey, what about this?  What's coming about this?  And stuff floods in.  All you'd have to do is tweet on Friday morning,  hey, guys, what do you vote  for the best segments of the week?  Yeah, but then you get from the audience, 
[03:30:00]  it's like, oh, that line Jim had Tuesday  about his cell phone,  that should be number five.  Well, I guess unless they're E-Rock and Sam Bits.  Why can't one of the Bits  be just one line from Jim Norton?  Why not?  I mean, it could be you.  Here's one line from Jim Norton.  And here is what it was.  In eighth place this week  is this line from Jim Norton.  That'd be great.  But you should do that as a goof anyway.  That'd be hilarious.  If other people wanted to work on the show,  we haven't been exclusive about it.  Oh! 
[03:30:30]  I mean, we're not...  Does anyone supervise you guys with the countdown?  They just tell us to do it.  I've had a child you don't understand.  Yeah, it's very busy.  No, no, there's other guys that should be really supervising them.  They say we don't tease the material enough.  Yeah, the intros...  Who likes countdowns?  We were told to do a countdown.  We were told to do the intros.  These are things that we've been told to do,  so we make the best out of it.  Wasn't that the thing that satellite radio  was supposed to get away from  was the traditional radio bullshit?  Yes.  And the countdown is one of the most 
[03:31:00]  hack traditional radio things ever, ever.  Ooh.  We didn't come up with the idea.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm not blaming you for that.  No way.  Okay.  Yeah, you didn't come up with the idea.  You just somehow turned it to be all about yourself.  Ooh!  But there ain't been any secret about that.  We intro the bits and say,  yeah, this is here because I'm in it.  And what I'm hearing you say  is that you basically thought  you'd keep doing that  until one of these guys noticed.  Ooh.  Until you said stop.  And then, okay.  Yeah, we never noticed.  But Lazlo noticed  because we don't listen.  And Lazlo was listening. 
[03:31:30]  Do you blame Sam, though?  I would have taken advantage  of the same situation.  Why would I put my bits in?  Sure.  If he takes advantage  of his own mother with laundry,  why would he take advantage  of the good nature of this program?  That is true.  How many bits are you featured  in this week, Sam?  Well, two?  Sam has two for this week.  How many do you have?  How many do you have?  None this week.  And it's also like  E-Rock puking.  Yeah, that's going to be high up.  That's better than Ian.  All right.  What are your two bits?  Oh, by the way,  E-Rock doesn't like Ian Halperin.  You don't?  Oh.  Not at all.  He said the show was a little slow. 
[03:32:00]  He slows down the show a bit.  That's always good to hear  when you're in the bathroom  in between breaks.  E-Rock, how's the show?  A little slow.  Well, thanks, fat self.  That's better now that Laszlo's here.  Ian was slowing down the show a little bit.  All right.  You've actually got to tell the truth.  But even that was a backward.  Yeah, and then I brought it to a screeching halt.  No, then that was a backward compliment, too,  because he goes,  but Laszlo's here to sort of pick it up.  I'm like, oh, wow, thanks.  Damn.  What's your two bits  you're featured in this week?  Well, circumcision.  The circumcision and the mommy issues  get separated into two. 
[03:32:30]  Those are good ones.  Sure.  Wait a minute.  And that's because.  Why separate it?  Otherwise, you've got like a 55-minute bit.  He can tease them through about eight breaks.  So there's some good stuff coming up.  Because.  You can hear me cackling in the background  on this next clip.  And then.  Because the tease is number one.  The teases are asked for.  Yeah.  And number two,  timing wise,  they said we don't want hour-long clips.  So if you have an hour.  You don't have to talk to me like a child.  You got your hand out 
[03:33:00]  and you're talking to me like a child.  Because I'm being accused of stuff.  I wasn't accused.  I asked you what were the bits?  What have I accused you of right here?  Well, you are.  The way you said how.  You guys said,  how is that two bits?  It's snarky.  What have I accused you of?  I'm sorry.  You really are.  This whole,  what I did was,  it has to be cut up into two.  What am I, a fucking intern?  Yeah, what is it?  He's the boss.  I didn't mean that towards you.  It's just my line of sight.  I was making my bones  when you still had a fucking pinhole for appeal. 
[03:33:30]  Motherfucker.  No.  The reason it's separated into two bits  is because of timing.  They don't want hour-long clips on the countdown.  What's timing?  Why don't they want hour-long countdown?  Because the audience won't sit around  and listen to something  that goes more than maybe 20 minutes.  But they listen to it  when it's happening live.  We did the whole thing in one break.  This is why I call them babysitters.  We were told to cut things down.  What is their experience  with a show like ours?  I'm still waiting for the answer  to that question.  We were told to cut things down  to 20 to 30 minutes.  So when you got an hour-long bit 
[03:34:00]  with two topics,  you got two bits.  So by that thinking,  O&A can go home at 6.30.  Yeah, why don't we do that?  Because we pretty much do  full breaks of an hour.  That's like when pop stations  cut Stairway to Heaven in half  because they didn't think  they would sit through  the whole fucking song.  What are they talking about?  Yeah, I would say  you should play something.  If it's an hour,  play it for an hour.  Right.  Well, we played Cherry Darts  in its entirety,  which was number one last week.  It went almost an hour.  We didn't cut that.  I understand you chop  some things out  where maybe it's a little slow.  Cut the fat.  Cut the fat. 
[03:34:30]  Thank you, Jimmy.  But not the whole fucking thing  to 20 minutes.  Condensing is what they say  we need to do.  There'll be weeks  where you'll have some amazing  comedians or celebrities in.  Right.  We're going to have to  fucking get involved.  And I don't hear,  I'm like,  I can't wait to hear that clip.  But it's always about,  oh, here comes Sam.  He brought a funny bit for Opie  and he's going to describe it  for the least 45 minutes.  Oh, man.  I don't think we've ever  left out any comedians  or celebrities.  Nope.  I don't think,  I mean,  our priority is to put 
[03:35:00]  the celebrities on.  I don't think we've ever  left out.  But have you ever done this  at the end of a Friday show?  Walked in,  hey guys,  putting together the  worst of the week.  Anything pop out of your head  that would be good  to put on it?  At the end of a Friday show?  No,  because I'd walk into  an empty room.  They're gone.  Oh, man.  No, at the end.  Wow.  All of a sudden,  sorry.  I'm going to defend that though,  really.  Sorry after,  you know,  four and a half hours  of constant talking.  I didn't say it was a bad thing.  About, you know,  and doing a program  and really trying to be 
[03:35:30]  high energy  at fucking an ungodly hour  in the morning.  Right.  I'm sorry  that when my shift is over,  I want to get the fuck  out of where I work.  You're allowed to.  Oh, am I?  I didn't say you couldn't.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  You didn't say I couldn't.  And Sam's lying.  You didn't say I couldn't.  Sam's lying too.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, Sam's lying.  They're advertising  the dumbest interns  that he was all over.  He was completely involved  in that one too.  Oh, so you're advertising  the dumbest interns  of all time 
[03:36:00]  on the Opie and Anthony show,  which you were a huge part of.  That means you have  three bits this week.  Yeah, I didn't even think.  The promo, though,  the promo is set up  so it's main clip  and then there's a clip of it.  Main clip  and then there's a clip of it  and then two minor ones.  This week's promo says  Slash George Wendt  and then quickly at the end  without clips to back them up,  it says my dick  and the dumbest intern.  Wait, we had George Wendt  made the countdown?  Yeah, we don't leave out celebrities.  That means we had a slow week.  What number is that? 
[03:36:30]  And my point was  come in at the break  before the end of the show,  like, you know,  right around now  and ask the head guys  what they would like  on their weekend program.  Laszlo, thanks to you,  now Sam has four bits  on the countdown.  Yeah, this is number one.  Oh, man.  Four bits.  Hold on, let's get some feedback  on this stupid thing.  Let's say how to flip  in Kentucky.  Flip.  You all need to  shut the hell up.  Sam and E-Rock  do a fine job 
[03:37:00]  on the countdown.  Thank you.  Oh, really?  I'm glad your uncle listens.  Oh.  We've had very little  negative feedback  from fans.  But Laszlo's point  is that probably  nobody listens  because they don't like it.  Yeah, that's true.  If they don't like it,  they're just not going to listen.  Yeah, that's what  Laszlo's point is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you want me  to say on that?  I mean, if they're not listening,  they're not listening.  You've admitted  that you've made  the weekend countdown  about you.  Yeah.  They did as a goof, though. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  That's like robbing a bank  as a goof.  Right, right.  You're like,  yeah, yeah, I robbed a bank,  I spent the money,  but I was just,  it was a goof.  I was kidding.  I was going to keep doing it  until I got caught.  I mean, there's never been  an instance where it's like,  obviously,  Sam put himself as number one  when it should have been this.  It's never happened  because I always put...  The numbers don't matter.  The numbers don't.  If you're in number one,  it doesn't matter  if you're number 10,  number one.  And there's been  very few instances  where there's a bit of mine  that's on that shouldn't be on.  I'll stand by every bit  that I put on.  Wow. 
[03:38:00]  He is cocksure.  Do you run the list  by anybody?  Cocksure.  Because I know the guys  that are running the channel  sort of,  they don't really listen  to the channel full time.  Ever since he lost his foreskin,  he just feels like  he can come in.  He's a new man.  He really is.  Who do you run the bits by?  They ask what's like  number one, number two,  and what bits are  on the countdown.  Who's they?  Bladder, Cross.  Oh, really?  So they are kind of involved?  Bladder every weekend  will say,  hey, Sam,  what made number one  this week?  Shouldn't they independently  get a little list together maybe?  And then you go through  that list and go,  well,  and then you hone the list?  If they wanted, 
[03:38:30]  it's not my place  to tell them.  Do they listen to the channel  full time?  They're supposed to,  I think.  Some people are taking  Sam's race into consideration  and saying  he's being uppity.  No.  You're being uppity.  If anything,  it's equal opportunity.  You were getting a bit preachy.  Yeah, he was kind of  talking to Ant,  like, what do you know?  Talking down to the  fucking white man.  Yeah, hey, Genzo,  this is how I do it.  Listen, WAP.  I didn't mean to talk  down to Anthony.  I respect Anthony,  Opie, Jimmy,  and Laszlo.  And we'll never do  best up for a WAP! 
[03:39:00]  Respect Laszlo,  who brought this  to everyone's attention?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean,  he gave me another bit.  Jesus.  Oh, this whole thing  is going to be...  This will absolutely  make the countdown.  Can we get rid  of the George Wendt?  Yes.  Yeah, this will be  George Wendt now.  George Wendt was electric.  What a drunk thing.  Is that terrible?  Well, if you're giving me  the honk...  Or maybe you have,  like, you know,  somebody in the office  that week gets to pick 
[03:39:30]  the, you know,  the best bits.  You know?  Or maybe it's  Jimmy saying,  I thought these were  the best bits  from the week.  We've never...  Anybody's welcome  to do it.  But you've never asked.  No one's ever consulted.  No one's ever offered either.  Yeah, I mean...  What do you mean  never offered?  No one came in  and said,  hey, I think this  should be number two  or number one  on the countdown.  But it's not their job.  Their job is to sit  in these chairs  and be funny  and create the number two  and number one.  And tell racist jokes  and make fun of Steve.  And we create  plenty of number two. 
[03:40:00]  Hey, is that a herd  of buffalo?  Yes.  Oh, that's a great  buffalo hunt.  Wow.  You can also  do your best  in the game  to make all  the buffalo extinct.  Please don't shoot me.  Yes.  They have a running count?  Yes.  I mean,  there's huge herds of them.  Why is this horse's tail  hanging off my forehead?  You don't understand.  I've just had cubs.  Yes, stop, please.  Oh, cease fire.  It's changed my whole 
[03:40:30]  outlook on life.  I get very angry  when somebody gets  near my cub.  All right, well,  Sam and E-Rock  continue doing a good job.  No one's...  Would you like me  to come in  and start asking you guys  what order you want bits in  or what bits you want  on the weekend?  Nope.  All right, then.  We'll keep doing  what we're doing.  I think we could do  better than a countdown, but...  Not Sam and E-Rock  radio on Twitter.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, E-Rock.  There it is.  There it is.  The two stars  of the weekend countdown. 
[03:41:00]  The whole show.  Yeah, it's not the whole show, really.  Dude, sometimes...  Some of their intros  are like five to ten minutes.  I have heard.  I do listen on Saturday  when I'm driving around.  I do pop on and listen,  and I know exactly  what you're getting at.  It is this long, drawn-out...  And completely blow it  for the mid-thing.  Like, you're waiting  for this build-up,  the crescendo,  and they've already told you  what's going to happen.  Yeah, exactly.  Or it's like this,  hey, you know what's great  about Saturday night?  Huh? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, my show tonight.  Yeah, they plug the shows  constantly.  You know that the babysitters  are finding out  for the first time  that this is going down?  Now they're going to make believe  they knew the whole time,  and they're going to, like,  you know, sit them down  and go, well,  we've got to, like,  make some adjustments.  Yeah.  They found out for the first time  that the weekends  are a complete wreck  around here.  Oh, dude, it...  And it's running itself.  It went to anarchy  on the weekends.  It really did.  We have to meet with...  Yeah, we got a meeting. 
[03:42:00]  We have a little meeting.  What's this meeting about?  We're going to...  They say it's about  stars, too, is it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's about the...  You're going to be on  Sirius for a month  free or something?  Yeah, one of those  free things.  Starting Monday?  That's all.  Oh, really?  Nice.  So for some reason  he needs to tell us that  or talk to us about it?  Yeah, maybe.  I guess it's just time  for FaceTime.  Yeah, we'll see.  Makes him happy.  I got my accountant  to go to,  so I can't stay long.  I know.  And then I have... 
[03:42:30]  I got to play.  Come on.  Dead Redemption.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The big plug.  I'm on.  Red Dead Redemption  came out two days ago.  Xbox 360, PS3.  You can go purchase  guns in the game  from Anthony.  Yes.  And also,  the great Ron Bennington  is a lawman in this...  Lawman Ron Bennington.  Yes.  Oh, that I want to hear.  So I will be playing  some clips of that  at noon today.  Can you tune in  to any radio shows 
[03:43:00]  during the game?  No.  Radio wasn't real popular  in 1910.  You can hear some  Morse code.  Yeah, exactly.  If you can figure it out.  All right, Lazlo.  Always a pleasure.  Enjoy Croatia.  Come back alive, please.  Yeah, I'll come back  with one leg.  No.  No, don't say that.  How would you surf?  Then you'll be Lazloa.  All right, that actually  wasn't too bad, Chip.  Terrible.  And I'll be at the Borgata  at July 2nd and 3rd.  I'm sorry people 
[03:43:30]  are sick of these plugs.  So will I.  Yes, you will.  I am absolutely going.  Anthony will be there  the 1st through the 11th.  I'll be there  the 2nd and 3rd.  And I'll be in Seattle  Friday the 28th  and then Caroline's  here in New York.  Did you even get to see...  3rd through the 6th of June.  Did you even get to see Jim  the last time you were down there?  We did.  We hung out.  No, I went down  and watched you gamble.  He didn't see the show.  No, I didn't go to the show.  Kenny's like,  I'm not sure if Anthony's coming.  I'm like,  he hasn't gotten out of bed  in 32 hours.  If they could wheel a table in,  a blackjack table in  to the venue  where you're playing Jimmy 
[03:44:00]  and I will just sit there  with the dealer  and play  and then occasionally  I'll look over  and go,  ha ha ha,  Jimmy,  you should pick me.  You should support Jimmy though.  Take a couple hours  from the game.  Well, he supported Jimmy  by spending, you know,  $500,000  or whatever the fuck  he was down there.  That's right.  Where do you think  Jimmy's pay comes from?  Exactly.  From my fucking blackjack table.  You want to just hand me  the money before I leave  on a Friday?  Please.  Call it even, right?  They're going to give me  a lot of dates  because they know  that the fucking whale  is a friend of mine.  Hey, Norton hangs out 
[03:44:30]  with fucking bank book  McGillicuddy.  All right.  You know what?  Good point.  Good point.  Laszlo, thank you.  We got to get out of here.  We really have a meeting.  Thanks, guys.  What time are you going  to be home?  I'm going to see your baby  today right after work.  Oh.  Let's make it 1045.  Okay.  I'll be there at 11.  Jimmy's seeing my baby.  When are you going  to see my baby at?  I've got to get over  the house.  I don't know when  I'm available.  And I'm not bringing  the baby here anytime soon.  No?  I'm not going to be a Steve  and bring a baby around.  Why not? 
[03:45:00]  Its soul would be taken out.  That's right.  That's true.  Because my baby's not  going to be that thing.  That thing?  Yeah.  That thing.  You can bring the baby  here, though, right?  No, you come and see  my baby.  I come and see the baby?  Yeah, I don't ask  for much from you.  Come see my fucking baby.  Come see your baby.  Jimmy's seeing my baby.  I can come see the baby.  Jimmy's going to hold  my baby.  Jimmy lives across  the street from the baby.  Dude, you could be over  my house in 10 minutes  with your ride.  Someone watch your car  out front. 
[03:45:30]  We know who that  someone is.  Okay.  Don't touch it.  Get away from the vehicle.  That's a bird.  Right.  He's got more brains  than him.  That's the bird  talking to him.  Stop shitting on the  windshield.  Okay.  All right.  Jimmy sees the baby.  Yeah, that's nice.  That makes me happy.  I'm healthy and ready.  I don't get to come  see the baby.  You want to come see  the baby?  I'll come see the baby  after Croatia.  Laszlo, have you seen  the baby?  After Croatia?  I'll come back after 
[03:46:00]  Croatia.  Uh-oh.  That would be nice.  God knows what he's  going to bring back  from Croatia.  Can we spray you  down now?  Croatian fungus.  Give the baby cholera.  I'm going to wash my  hands.  1800s disease.  Before I hold the baby,  I'll wash my hands.  Do you hold babies?  Yeah, of course I do.  I do it seated, though,  because I don't want  the little heads to  flop back, but I sit down.  This kid is already  holding its head up  on its own.  I don't know what  we gave birth to.  Hold your head up.  I mean, it was late.  11 days late.  Nine pounds, four ounces.  I think it said

You're going to see  a very mini version  of me.  Wow.  He's got a bit  of a tood already.  Right.  He's calling everybody  that he works with  me-sitters.  Right on.  All right.  We'll see you guys  tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  Lazlo's going to be  on Ronda Fez,  so check that out.  Tune in, Ronda Fez.  Sure, in a little bit. </pre>
