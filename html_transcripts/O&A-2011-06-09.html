<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The June 9th, 2011, Opie and Anthony show was dominated by the fallout from their tweeting a picture of Anthony Weiner's genitals.  The photo was initially shown to Opie and Anthony by Andrew Breitbart, who later expressed significant displeasure with its release, claiming it was done without his permission and that Jim Norton falsely stated there were no cameras in the studio.  The hosts countered that while initially there were no cameras directly focused on them, the phone displaying the photo was later passed near a live camera, resulting in its capture and subsequent online distribution.  Breitbart called into the show to voice his complaints, and the hosts discussed damage control and their interactions with Breitbart and his lawyer.  Vincent D'Onofrio, a guest promoting *Law & Order*, was present during the entire incident, and his reactions were discussed at length, including the media's amusing misidentification of him as one of the hosts.  The hosts also heavily criticized inaccurate media coverage from various outlets like the Associated Press, CNN (who mistakenly used an outdated Sirius XM logo), and offered commentary on responses from Sean Hannity, Ed Schultz, and Stephen Colbert.  The broadcast included audio and video clips from the studio documenting the event.  The discussion was punctuated with numerous sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes, including a recurring comedic use of the word "surmising," and humorous stories involving dogs and peanut butter.  The hosts also referenced their past controversies, including the “Sex for Sam” incident with Paul Mercurio, and mocked the reactions of other radio personalities like Todd Schnitt.  A future guest, Josh Gad, was mentioned.

Later in the show, Josh Gad, an actor from *The Book of Mormon*, joined the studio.  The conversation shifted to *The Book of Mormon*'s success, Gad's experiences performing the show (including encounters with Chevy Chase, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, and Angela Lansbury), and the possibility of a future tour or film adaptation. Gad also discussed his background and the show's development.  A clip of Gad singing "Man Up" from the musical was played. Following Gad's departure, Steve-O joined to promote his book, *Professional Idiot: A Memoir*.  He shared anecdotes from his career, including details about his stunts, struggles with addiction and recovery, and a humorous story involving a transsexual person. A significant portion of this segment focused on his book, particularly the chapter titled "My Son is a Shit Fuck," and discussions about LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The show's after-show largely centered on the aftermath of the Weiner photo incident and its viral spread across various media platforms like Gawker, Salon, Fox News, and CNN.  Roland's emotional breakdown on air, stemming from work-related stress and a conflict with Anthony regarding a potential Glenn Close guest appearance, was discussed extensively. The possibility of Ronnie B's involvement in manipulating events was speculated upon. The hosts engaged in a humorous, often insulting, exchange with Nicole from the "Morning Mashup," particularly focusing on Stan's outfit.  Jim Norton contributed to the banter via text messages, including an apology to someone referred to as "Fat Tits."  Vincent D'Onofrio's unexpected presence in the media coverage was again mentioned.  The hosts' receipt of a pizza party from management as a reward for the unexpected positive publicity was also noted.  Finally,  the hosts brainstormed potential names for their after-show.  The entire broadcast extensively referenced the hosts' previous controversies, including incidents involving Jesse Ventura, Sharon Osbourne, and Paris Hilton, and highlighted their dissatisfaction with their current Sirius XM work environment compared to their previous experience at XM.

[00:03:00]  Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests.  Interesting interviews.  And of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hogging.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're good.  Let's welcome our hosts, O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Well, thank you, Mr. King.  Blood, blood, blood away.  Thank you, Larry.  The Larry King intro.  I love that one.  Yeah.  I like what the boys are doing with the intros.  I find it hurtful.  Getting big name stars to intro this show.  Big stars.  Big drivel.  Well, to prove we're live, it's Thursday.  Yeah.  There it is.  August 15th, 2006. 
[00:04:30]  August 15th, 2006.  Right.  Someday, the Book of Mormon will be seen.  Ah.  No, it's Thursday, June 9th, 2011.  Yes.  And, wow.  Any worthless guests today?  Yeah, I want to cancel all guests.  Although we saw the Book of Mormon last night.  Yeah.  And Josh Gad, I believe that's how you say his last name.  He's the star of the show.  Yeah.  One of the stars of the show.  He's coming in, and this guy is fucking hilarious and just talented as all hell, man. 
[00:05:00]  Hilarious.  It was an amazing show last night, man.  Yeah, Jimmy went again.  Obviously, we're going to get into what everyone's listening to us for today.  But, quickly, Book of Mormon.  Yeah.  This damn Broadway show is getting rave reviews.  I finally went last night with my wife.  Jimmy went.  Chevy Chase went.  Chevy Chase.  Yeah.  I saw the picture of Chevy.  And my girl's like, please don't do this. 
[00:05:30]  I'm like, what?  Because that's my thing?  Making everyone uncomfortable?  Like, Jimmy likes to get celebrity photos?  I like taking pictures of celebrities and being very just creepy about it and uncomfortable  about it.  None of us approached Chevy Chase.  Nobody.  No one in the theater, matter of fact.  I would have said hi to him, but I was like, eh, whatever.  I got a text from Ope's wife, and she's like, I'll read it verbatim.  She was fucking not happy with his.  I don't think Chevy is a.  A lot of people haven't been happy with his photo taking lately. 
[00:06:00]  There's one.  And his wife is one of the people who is not pleased with his photo taking.  Hold on.  I hope you know that was in jest.  Yeah.  Why?  Okay.  No, because we have dummies out there.  It's fine.  Go ahead.  She writes, Greg is taking pictures.  Do you want to switch seats?  Chevy was howling at the Book of Mormon.  Went nuts.  He was howling.  Loved it.  He was standing up at times, like, out of his mind. 
[00:06:30]  He was loving it.  Really?  And he was one of the first guys to jump up and give the standing ovation at the end  of the show.  Wow.  This Book of Mormon, man, you got to see it.  It really is amazing, man.  Yeah, I definitely got to see this one.  You got to remind yourself you're on Broadway, because the material is extremely edgy.  It's blue.  They have baby fucking jokes in a Broadway musical on Broadway.  Fantastic.  And it completely works.  I got to see it.  Yeah, everybody I've heard from that has seen it says it's great. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, so I did that last night to get away from the coverage.  How did we get ourselves in the middle of this thing?  I was laughing, thinking about that.  It's like, man.  It always happens to us.  Can I, but you guys, do you understand, after the show, I went and did an hour interview  with Tom Papa.  Had a lovely time, and I come out, and I'm talking to Liam, and he goes, can you believe 
[00:07:30]  he tweeted the photo?  I'm like, what photo?  And he goes, oh, he tweeted the photo.  We all did, though.  I, but I, that was what he said to me.  Yeah, there's a lot of, like, we'll get, we'll get all the facts out there in the next  hour or so, trust me.  But we all tweeted the photo.  Did you tweet a photo officially, Jimmy?  No.  Okay.  So me and Ann certainly tweeted a photo.  The listeners were tweeting photos, possibly before we tweeted photos.  It was during the shit hour.  Yeah.  It all went down during the shit hour. 
[00:08:00]  I never liked to listen to the shit hour.  That's one I would have liked to have heard.  It really is a fucking bust.  You do.  It was, uh, it was, it was, it just all, it just happened.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  That photo, I'll say this much.  That photo was going to absolutely be out there, in my opinion, by Monday.  I think it, I think it would have survived the weekend.  Maybe.  That photo was going to be out there by Monday.  I don't know if Andrew Breitbart or Breitbart was going to do it himself. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know.  Well, I don't know what he, he's thinking, but I had a feeling that it was going to be  out there some way, somehow by Monday.  Yeah.  And then we had an opportunity and we, we, we took a shot.  What are you going to do?  You know, uh, you know, when that, when, when the Wiener story first started, I had a  weird feeling that once again, we would be right in the middle of that shit.  I didn't know that.  I had a weird feeling.  That was a picture I took of, uh, walking into Fox last night because I did a red eye 
[00:09:00]  segment.  Yep.  And, uh, as I'm walking in, there it is.  X rated pics shows a man's genitals on the giant ticker that goes around the entire building.  Yeah.  It's not just a part of the building anymore.  No, I'm just looking at it and it's like, that's, that's hilarious.  Oh, what are you going to do?  I'm like, that's hilarious.  Are we trying to get Breitbart on the phone?  I guess.  We should try to get him on.  Yeah.  He's not, he's not happy with us.  I had, I talked to him twice last night. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I talked to him a couple of times.  Not happy.  Not happy.  He, uh, we've said, we've said it in many different ways.  It was, we believe he didn't want the photo out at the time we were talking to him.  I don't know what the future was going to bring with him in that photo, but I strongly  believe he, he didn't want it out yesterday.  No.  And I don't think he wanted us to, uh, be the ones that put it out there.  Nope.  I don't think he wanted anybody to be the ones that put it out there yesterday.  Right.  Uh, and I talked to him and, uh, yeah, he was none too happy. 
[00:10:00]  And then he, you know, he was like, he was like, could you help me out and just write  something up that says that it wasn't me doing that.  And I'm like, all right.  So I wrote something up real quick and I sent it to him to say, you know, is this okay?  Is this good?  And, uh, he was like, yeah.  And then I get a, an email from like a lawyer and, uh, and it's like, well, yeah, the statement  you did is okay, but, uh, we'd like to add a couple of things to it.  I was like, add something to it, send it back to me and, um, I'll, I'll check it out and 
[00:10:30]  see if I still feel comfortable with it.  And I didn't, there were too many weird lawyerly fucking things in there that made it sound  like I was being implicated in something.  So I was like, you know, I, I talked to my agent and stuff and I'm just not comfortable  with what's in this, uh, revised statement.  I said, I'll be glad to go on any show or, or write something that said, look, uh, Andrew  knew nothing about this. 
[00:11:00]  He didn't release it.  Uh, uh, we got a picture of it from his phone and posted it.  Right.  And, uh, again, he knew nothing of this, had no knowledge of this and that's fine, but  I wasn't going to start going like it was a, uh, a strong breach of trust that like, I  don't like words like breach from a lawyer, things like that.  So it got, it got weird because I was like, look, I'm, I'm willing to help out, uh, Andrew  and, and, you know, completely state the case that he had nothing to do with this picture 
[00:11:30]  getting out, but I'm not going to start implicating me, Opie, Jimmy, the show.  So, uh, I can't, I can't do that.  And then I noticed a couple of statements that were put out that had little pieces of the  revised statement in it.  And I'm like, that's not what I said.  That's why this is extremely interesting.  Cause so much shit gets twisted.  Words get twisted. 
[00:12:00]  Things get edited.  That's why, thank God we have our own show and we'll go through the whole damn thing once  again for everybody.  I, I, Bob called me, he said, uh, you know, the AP wants to talk to you and we're getting  other requests.  I'm like, I'm not doing fucking anything.  I'm going to sit in my bed, even though it's a hundred degrees out and I'll control my  part anyway, through, through Twitter and YouTube.  Fuck these people.  You should talk to them.  I don't trust anybody.  If you talk to them today, this way they can't twist anything.  I talked to AP yesterday.  Oh yeah.  Okay.  But they twisted your AP a little bit too, didn't they? 
[00:12:30]  Well, all they did was add one line that it's like, we regret what happened.  Oh, you didn't say that, right?  To the bottom of my statement.  And I never said that.  Yeah.  Why would they just add that?  I never said that.  Yeah.  That seemed odd.  Yeah.  We're not, we're not going to, we're not going to push you out now and say we, we, uh,  regret it.  No, whatever happened, happened.  You know, there was an opportunity, uh, upon us and, uh, spare of the moment.  We decided to go for it.  That's it.  That's it.  Over the years, we've been known to do such things.  We didn't, uh, have an agenda when, uh, Breitbart came in here and, you know, it, it presented 
[00:13:00]  itself and we decided to go with it.  That's, that's the story right there.  I wasn't trying to fuck over Andrew Breitbart either on the whole thing.  It's, you know, obviously he's mad and shit like that, but I saw like that happens.  I saw that somebody tweeted me and said, uh, well, you're, I don't care if my name is mentioned  because I was in the studio, but he was saying that, uh, well, and Jim Norton, their co-host  assured me there were no cameras in the room. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm like, wait, when did I say that?  Like, because when you come in here, you sign something that says you're okay with being  filmed.  Sam was standing between ONA with a video camera the whole time because D'Onofri was in here.  Standing.  Standing.  So it wasn't like he was hiding or nothing.  I mean, if you're looking at me and Anna as you're doing this radio show, you're going  to see Sam in between us with a camera.  You can't help but not see him.  And Andrew was talking about, and I'm like, I don't remember saying that.  So I watched the tape.  I believed him that I had said it.  And he said, cause that was one of the things that made me feel comfortable enough to send 
[00:14:00]  the phone around.  You said there was no cameras, but I'm like, there was a video.  And I realized it was the very beginning.  He pulls his phone out and D'Onofri was there and he's asking to see it a little bit.  And I'm like, come on, man.  There's no cameras.  Meaning I think he's going to hold the phone up.  Right.  And me and Vincent, our hands are empty.  We're just going to look at the picture.  We're not going to do anything with it.  Right.  And I didn't say pass it around the studio and pass it by the video.  And I explained that to him and he's like, all right, I won't say that.  Because it's like, I don't care if you mentioned my name. 
[00:14:30]  I'm here.  Right.  But don't act like I set you up because I certainly didn't.  And he knows that now.  I talk to him.  Everything is cool.  Yeah, yeah.  But I just didn't want to be implicated like I'm some fucking, like I set him up.  I did not do that.  Safe to say when you come in here, Sam tries to film as much as possible.  I have my own private fucking camera that I bring in every day.  We all have cell phones that have video capability.  I have this for my pictures.  We have this camera over here up on the ceiling that is used so we could communicate with the booth.  That's constantly on. 
[00:15:00]  There's a lot of fucking video in this room.  Where is the E-Rock TV?  It's broken.  They're fixing it.  Oh.  So.  How am I going to watch E-Rock?  So Sam realized that he did catch on video Breitbart, you know, kind of talking about the picture and then, you know, passing the phone around a little bit.  And then the footage ends.  What happened?  You decided to stop filming, Sam?  Well, I didn't film when the phone was over by us. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  I didn't want him to think.  I mean, my video camera is not the camera that picked up the phone.  And so when the phone was passed from Anthony to Opie, I wasn't the camera.  You pushed the camera up.  I remember him doing it.  I did see you do that.  I saw you do that.  Right.  Sort of out of respect, we were doing that.  Just so he knew that I wasn't, that wasn't the plan because it wasn't.  Well, Vincent was like, wow.  There's a great little video clip where Andrew Breitbart, you know, holds up the phone to Vincent.  I can't, D'Onofrio, right? 
[00:16:00]  D'Onofrio, right.  And he, his reaction is pretty priceless.  Well, one of the funniest fucking things last night was watching the news and they were  talking about this show and what had happened.  And all you see is Jim Norton and Vincent D'Onofrio.  Like it came from the Norton and D'Onofrio show.  Like poor Vincent D'Onofrio has to get himself involved in this shit because he was just sitting  there.  He was just here to promote law and order. 
[00:16:30]  He's just sitting there.  Came back to do the last eight episodes.  And Private Pyle is now involved in the Wiener fucking story.  And see the value of filming everything.  Oh, God.  It's safe to say, you know, him and Andrew do not see eye to eye whatsoever.  But this video kind of makes it look like they're palsy-wowsy.  On a side note with Vincent.  Look at us together.  We look like old friends, me and Vince.  I know.  Well, he pushed all the way over to you because he realized who Andrew Breitbart was.  He didn't want to be near Andrew.  Is there any way we can get that last? 
[00:17:00]  It's at like from two minutes on where I say that thing about the camera.  Oh, wait.  Why don't we just play it?  Play the whole thing?  Okay.  Yeah.  Play the whole thing.  So this is, yeah, I guess this is the beginning of the story, right?  But look at how close the camera is on Breitbart.  That's why I wouldn't have thought that he didn't know there was a real video camera because  it zoomed in on him.  No offense to Andrew, but I mean, if you're in the media like this, he had to know there  was a camera in this room.  We're always aware.  I mean, every time I walk in and out of this building, I'd take a look around and see what  the fuck is up for the day. 
[00:17:30]  But he's looking right at the camera in that shot.  Plus, I was filming him when it was just him in there.  It wasn't like I just came in when D'Onofrio...  Your camera was probably on for close to an hour straight.  At least, yeah.  By the way, a little side note, Vincent D'Onofrio, he was great.  He was great.  Because I heard from many people that he's a very tough interview.  Really?  Yeah, that he doesn't really talk a lot.  He doesn't enjoy doing interviews is what I've heard. 
[00:18:00]  I wonder why.  Yeah, I wonder why.  Because he pulled into a sex scandal?  Put him right back there.  But man, he was fun and open and laughing and everything.  Well, he...  He didn't mind talking about acting, the craft of acting.  Yeah, yeah, he loved that.  He had to loosen up a little bit.  Yeah.  But then when he loosened up, he was...  Absolutely, he was great.  Let's go to this tape.  So this is Andrew Breitbart, and this is sort of where it all begins.  Do you want the part of him explaining it to you?  Yeah, man.  The whole thing.  A lot of people that usually don't listen to us are listening right now to get the story. 
[00:18:30]  This is on OP Radio.  This is the video tape.  By the way, this is from the camera feed.  So in the background, you can hear me go, there's no cameras.  Right, right.  From the radio feed, you can hear better.  We need to stop this to explain it, because we want to get all the facts out today.  Because, I mean, the media, we've learned over the years, just spin and fuck up everything.  Yes, they do.  We never get things completely right.  Yeah.  Yeah, this was my last tweet of the night, this video, if you want to check it out for yourself.  But we're going to play it here.  Go ahead, Sam.  It is satellite radio, so you can be as graphic as you want. 
[00:19:00]  There's a particular cinematic angle in which you're able to create the perception that something is larger than it actually is.  Force perspective.  And then, you know, mostly, if I'm holding a camera and I'm looking down, you see something, you know, but this guy somehow figured out how to do it from the exact opposite angle, looking up.  Ah, bottom up. 
[00:19:30]  Yes, here's how I, here's what I would.  So it's like standing at the base of the Empire State Building with the camera phasing out.  Here's what I would title it.  If water was leaking off it.  If I were to title this, and I'm like a photo editor at the AP, and I needed to come up with a title for it, I would call it Two Balls, One Shaft, dot JPG.  Okay.  Two Balls, One Shaft, dot JPG.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, from the undercarriage perspective.  And is he fully aroused? 
[00:20:00]  I just want to stop.  I mean, obviously, Andrew's showing his balls right there.  He's bragging, man.  He's got this picture, and he wants, now he's not even hinting anymore.  I got a cock picture is basically what he just said.  Greta Van Susteren asked him a good question.  She said, why do you have this on your phone?  Why is this picture on your phone in the first place?  And he said, well, it's from the source.  That's where it came from.  But you would think if you wanted this thing under lock and key, you would transfer it to your computer, put it in a passworded folder, at the very least, and erase it from your phone. 
[00:20:30]  And I don't think Brightball, I honestly.  And I'm not blaming him.  No, no, I'm being, I talked to him last night.  I really do not think he's spinning or bullshitting.  I think that he honestly did not want that photo out.  And he's not trying to throw this show under the bus.  He is just trying to prove that he's being truthful. 
[00:21:00]  Because he's frustrated because the media hates him.  A lot of the media hates his guts.  And they're just, they know what happened, but they don't care.  They're seizing on this to go, ah, Breitbart lied.  Even though deep down they know what happened.  They know the phone got passed around.  It was dumb of him to do, but it wasn't dishonest.  And it's like, if you have that picture, he's a fucking person.  He's just showing it to prove that he has it.  And who doesn't want to show something like that off?  Why wouldn't you have that on your phone?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I mean, even the hardcore news guys that you think you respect and think have, you know, 
[00:21:30]  chill lives would have that on their phone.  Yeah, they got that.  Wolf Blitzer would have that on his phone, in my opinion.  You know, deep in the Pentagon, they're showing Bin Laden death pictures on their phones.  There's a bunch of guys that are well-respected that probably have that picture on their phones.  Yeah, that's our next.  Oh, next week.  That's our next.  Next week.  I'm serious.  Next week's expose.  Yeah.  We got the photo.  Bin Laden death photo. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, we got to spread this shit out, though, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  You can't do it all in one day.  The great goof would have been if Opie had Twittered my cock picture.  Yes.  And they grabbed on it.  And then Bright Ball would have said, that's not the penis.  That is not his cock.  You don't think I thought about that?  I don't have to send you one, unless you have the ones I've emailed you.  I've seen a few of your cock pics.  I have one really good one.  By the way, when Andrew was describing the angle, I don't know if you can hear me go,  yes, yes, that's how you do it. 
[00:22:30]  Because I have one picture.  I really should be sued for false advertising.  It makes me look like I'm all cock.  Wow.  It's a good one.  But it's deceptive.  I have a nice penis, but not the penis in that photo.  Deceptive.  All right, hit this back.  So the video from yesterday.  There it is.  Oh, Jesus.  You're in Arizona.  Okay, go ahead.  We're literally everywhere today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From the undercarriage perspective. 
[00:23:00]  And is he fully aroused in this photo?  Oh, he's an excited chap.  An excited chap.  Yeah.  And I'm just talking, I think he's the most heterosexual guy out there.  Okay, he really is.  But he's definitely reading all the magazines that give him the tips that will cause the men  to go, whoa, this is my kind of guy.  I'm talking this guy, unless he has that hair disease where you don't have hair. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, I got you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where it's completely bought?  Not completely.  There might have been some shaving going on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is blue boy circuit 2000.  Let me think.  I'm just a four-ish.  Blue boy two-year-old.  Did he get something nice?  I think he's got something.  Come on, come on.  Let's do nothing.  Is there a photo?  Take a look.  Vincent's begging to see it.  I don't know.  She's right there.  I just said her. 
[00:24:00]  Stop it.  I said, there's no cameras.  Meaning, I'm saying that, maybe I should have phrased that differently, but I'm being  honest.  It really was.  I was saying, there's no cameras.  We're not going to snap a photo if you just hold your phone.  I didn't expect the guy to pass the phone around.  I would have told him, don't give it to these two.  But honestly, that was what that is.  And I think that he just seized on that because I don't think he's bullshitting or I don't think  he's trying to throw anybody under the bus.  He is just trying to show that he was not party to the photo, whatever. 
[00:24:30]  And he wasn't.  Let's see, Jimmy.  You want to?  Yeah.  That's the famous.  I do.  Queer I sound like.  That's the famous to Vincent.  You mean that's really his?  Yeah.  He sent that?  To Andrew.  To the 10.  Who did he send?  Listen to Vincent.  To a gal down in Texas.  Oh.  Wow.  That's a good angle, though.  He's a smart guy.  He's in very good shape. 
[00:25:00]  All I can say is from seeing that picture, I want that guy as mayor.  Because he is loaded.  That is.  Did I feel it comes off like an innocent bystander, too?  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't come off like he's in on it.  And he comes off like he's not saying the guy should resign or he's throwing him under the  bus.  No, no, no, no.  He's just having fun.  Right.  He's actually complimenting the guy's big, delicious cock.  Absolutely.  But just the fact that he was on TV, it just made me laugh. 
[00:25:30]  It's like, why is Private Pile and Jimmy disgusting wiener's dick?  He's watching going, I'm in a sex scandal with the guy who couldn't act and wanted me  to sign his movie.  Who is he?  People are like, wow, open hands have really changed.  Private Pile.  I know.  He shot himself on a toilet.  I know.  We finally get him.  Yes.  And we get some broiled in this.  He's called the atomic bomb, though.  That's the one that's the one that's going to kill everybody.  Has not.  But they can't show the light of day. 
[00:26:00]  No.  That is true.  They can't.  But on the internet, they could under an explicit.  By the way, could you pause?  Did anybody see?  Yeah.  That right there.  And that you could see Breitbart handing it over.  Nobody asked for it.  He just handed it over.  Now he's now it's going to go around the room.  But by the way, I just wanted to point out what a fucking weasel I am agreeing.  Like when he goes, they can't show it on TV.  Nope, they can't.  You know, just me and Vince.  Nope.  Nope.  A couple of buddies agreeing.  Can you just rewind that fucking worm?  I just caught myself.  What a worm I am.  A green zilch.  Yeah.  Well, that's the one that's going to kill everybody. 
[00:26:30]  Has not.  But they can't show the light of day.  No.  That is true.  They can't.  But on the internet, they could under an explicit.  That is true.  That is true.  They can't.  They can't.  Factual Jimmy.  Thank you.  That's true, Vincent.  He should have put a DI hat on me and just shot me in the chest.  On the internet, they could under an explicit.  I think that anybody that sees this photo should elect this guy from New York.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he's definitely well equipped.  Now, Jimmy's looking at it.  He's well equipped for the job.  You need a good set when you're running this city. 
[00:27:00]  You do.  Wowee.  Hey, take a look.  Wowee.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, so then Jimmy took a look and said, wow, he passed the phone to Anthony.  Yes.  And then you passed the phone on to me.  I picked up my own camera.  I put Andrew Breitbart's camera down on the console, and I was trying to get a picture.  I'm not even going to lie.  And he was.  Because I'm thinking, wow, it'd be cool to have this picture because now maybe I could  show my friends.  And that's how this shit gets out there, by the way.  I wasn't even sure if I was going to tweet.  I'll be honest with you.  And just as I'm trying to take a picture of Andrew Breitbart's phone, Anthony realizes 
[00:27:30]  what I'm doing, grabs the phone, making my shot really blurry.  And I'm like, fuck.  Well, because.  I don't have it.  Because Andrew, at that point, was looking.  Right.  Like, and if he saw snapping the picture.  Did he see you trying to snap a photo?  He absolutely did.  It would have been, yeah.  He absolutely saw me trying to take a picture of his phone.  And never said a thing about that after the interview.  I was like, oh, no, no.  Oh, oh.  And then, you know, I may have inadvertently swung it in front of a camera, another live 
[00:28:00]  camera in the studio.  For a second or two.  For a second or two.  And someone.  Screen capped that.  Capped it.  Mm-hmm.  And it got back.  And wow.  And then they sent it to you immediately.  And it was loosey-goosey.  But you didn't send anything from his BlackBerry or anything like that?  Hell no.  No, I didn't think so.  Wait, but I'm trying to figure this out.  So I tried to take a picture of Andrew Breitbart's phone.  And it rips the phone out of my hand, basically.  So I don't really get the shot.  It's blurry.  Then it was in front of a camera for a couple seconds. 
[00:28:30]  Was that when Andrew was still in the room?  Yeah.  But he didn't know that.  He didn't know that.  Because I want to get all the facts out.  He absolutely did not know that.  That was more covert than you placing it on the console, standing over it with your camera.  Yeah, but I was just kind of going for that.  You know, I was being goofy and possibly a little like, oh my God, what is he going to do type of shit.  You know what I mean?  That's what it was more about.  Because at that point, I wasn't thinking, like, I'm going to try to get this picture and then tweet it immediately.  I really wasn't thinking that. 
[00:29:00]  I wasn't sure what I was going to do.  Probably in the end I would have.  But at that moment, I don't know.  The guy who screencapped it originally, this is Travis and Mai's favorite part of this entire story.  A couple outlets posted his original screencap, and under his real name on Twitter, it's Mr. Maloonigan.  Mr. what?  Mr. Maloonigan.  That's Bobo's dog.  Is it?  Yeah, so a bunch of news sites that said Mr. Maloonigan. 
[00:29:30]  Bobo's dog.  Oh, that's hilarious.  We're going to have to get into all of that, because supposedly in, I think, a Norwegian paper, they quoted my Twitter profile that I was a model, and I gave a model in to tell dick jokes on the radio.  Oh, no.  They wrote that as a serious thing.  The media just sucks.  I know we're kind of part of it, but they just suck.  No offense, but how could they not know that you're not a model?  Thank you, yeah.  Especially now.  This is a tired fucking face. 
[00:30:00]  They fucking don't check a thing.  They don't check anything.  So, yeah, it was screencapped while Andrew was still in the room, but I swear to you, it's my opinion he did not know that went down.  The interview ended, because Jimmy wasn't around when it got really crazy.  I was talking to Tom Papa having a lovely comedy chat.  Yes.  I'm not angry.  I just was shocked when Liam said that to me.  Because all that happened right at the end of the official show, which is sort of 6 to 10-ish, right?  So, then Jimmy leaves. 
[00:30:30]  Andrew Breitbart said, thank you.  I had a great time.  I would love to do more radio with you guys.  I'll be back soon.  And D'Onofio was great.  He had a great time.  And then Sam was starting the 10 o'clock hour after ONA Live, the official name.  And then me and Ant just started looking at each other like, what are we doing?  Are we going to do this?  Yeah.  Because then I started tweeting the blurry picture. 
[00:31:00]  And then Ant's like, fuck that.  I'm going to tweet this picture.  And then you showed me the phone, your phone, with the picture that was screencapped.  And then I took a picture of that.  It was just going back and forth.  We were just going.  Yeah, yeah.  We were kind of making a, kind of being goofy about it.  Yeah, it was kind of fun.  And even at that point, I didn't think it was much of a big deal because we didn't even get a great picture of it.  It was very pixelated.  Very pixelated and blurry to begin with because it's off numerous sources by the time we tweeted it, right?  But he, Breitbart's got like the pristine picture. 
[00:31:30]  So he still has, you know.  Doesn't matter anymore.  Unless there's more photos.  Because if he sent it to a girl in Texas, she has it.  Yeah, I like to think that we prevented that whore from having a picture.  Payday.  Because she has the photo.  I don't know if she's a whore.  I don't even know her name.  I should not say that.  I have no idea.  But, you know.  In theory, being released by somebody. 
[00:32:00]  But I think he just doesn't want anybody to think that he broke his word.  It's a really weird thing with these guys.  But the media gives him so much shit.  He doesn't want people to think that he lied when he said he wasn't going to release it.  And if Wiener had sent this to different women, and obviously he sent it to this.  If he said a gal in Texas, I doubt that's the only woman he ever sent it to.  Somebody was probably negotiating.  These women, if there are some, were probably negotiating to get a fucking payday, like you said.  And that's probably the only reason you got the jump on them.  There's the picture of Anthony holding up his phone with the picture on it that I took. 
[00:32:30]  My iPhone's famous.  It's not your iPhone.  It's my iPhone.  No.  No?  What is it?  You have your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  That is a naughty boy phone.  Your naughty boy's phone and your good boy's phone.  Him have a good boy phone and him naughty boy phone.  Him naughty boy phone and him good boy phone.  And him good boy.  My wife was telling you last night that my son dances to the remix that Drew Boogie made. 
[00:33:00]  If you know how happy that makes me.  She puts it on for him and he loves it.  And people are like that she knows in her life or contacting her as Chip.  I can't tell you how happy I'm destroying their household.  You really are just a wake of destruction.  We have a really good friend that is Abu Dhabi and all that.  He's always moving.  Then all of a sudden he's in Australia.  We don't really know what he does for a living.  I've brought him up a few times. 
[00:33:30]  He's in the army, but I don't know, man.  There's something very suspicious there.  He's kind of moving around a lot.  Secret agent, man.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But he's a huge fan of the show.  They've given you a number.  But he...  Taken away your name.  He lives so far away that he's about a month behind on this show.  So he'll comment about the show to us.  And I'm like, we did that like a month ago.  Because I know I'm that far behind because, you know, I'm busy with stuff that I can't talk about. 
[00:34:00]  Imus was just talking about this whole situation.  So I sent Opie an email.  You did?  I said, you can't go to Opie and Anthony's studio.  Breitbart, what's his name?  Breitbart.  He seems like an idiot to me.  I mean, he doesn't seem like the brightest bulb in me.  Whatever.  So if you go into Opie and Anthony's studio, they are now my heroes, by the way.  With your cell phone, and pass it around to those guys, and Jim Norton's there? 
[00:34:30]  What are you, nuts?  Okay, you promise, guys?  See, we're trying to be nice about it, but this is perfect.  You promise, guys?  You promise, guys?  You're nuts.  You promise, guys?  I mean, John P.  That's it, man.  Swear to God.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, here you go.  It's wrong, but I got on my cell phone.  Take a look.  You moron.  Don't show anybody. 
[00:35:00]  No, no, yeah.  I mean, Anthony had to jerk the phone away from Opie because Opie was trying to take a picture  of it with his phone.  Oh, no, come on.  And then, of course, as soon as then, and then their video camera system in the studio got  it, right, Lou?  Yes, they take this artificially, yes.  Exactly right.  And then they were fighting one another to see who could tweet it first.  Good for them. 
[00:35:30]  That's exactly how it went down.  Imus got the story completely right.  He's the only guy that gets it completely right.  And that's exactly what we said.  Me and Ann looked at each other like, fuck you.  I'm going to tweet this first.  A little competition between me and Ann.  At that point.  And Imus, the only guy that got every bit of that right.  Good for them.  Rob sent me Opie on YouTube explaining what happened, and that's what they do.  I mean, that's, come on. 
[00:36:00]  We would have done the exact same thing, won't we?  We would have thunk it.  Opie and Anthony.  You promise, guys?  You promise, guys?  I was thinking that, though, last night.  I'm just like, when this whole thing started, like, the last thing I thought was this dopey  ass show would be the one that put the cockpit out.  I just had a feeling.  On this one, I just had a weird feeling somehow we were going to get involved.  The cockpit.  And then when you were out drinking with all those guys a couple nights ago, I'm like, 
[00:36:30]  we are so going to be the one.  I just knew in my soul we were going to be the ones.  Yeah, I just knew.  Yeah, it was something.  Well, after we left yesterday, getting back to what happened, so we did what we did yesterday.  We were fighting each other to tweet at first.  Yeah.  Not really thinking, you know, about relationships or anything.  We just knew we had something.  We're like, fuck, we can't help ourselves.  You know?  The news just went nuts.  Yeah.  And that's where we're at here. 
[00:37:00]  Bob calling me for the first time in months.  This is crazy.  Yeah, I know, Bob.  Shut up.  Go do what you do.  I'm doing what I do.  This is, oh my, wow, it's, yeah, I know.  Bob is a breathy ass.  He really gets like...  That's all that French horn playing.  He exhales heavily.  Like he's playing the horn all the time.  Exactly.  I wish he was playing the horn, but it was actually a shotgun.  Stupid agent.  Before I hung up on him.  Totally do.  Flunk.  Before I hung up on him, he said something like, and the company has no problem with this 
[00:37:30]  one.  Fuck wow.  All right, whatever.  I don't care if they do.  News.  I don't care if they do at this point.  Probably because there's things signed or whatever.  I don't know.  I wouldn't even care.  Why am I speculating?  Anyway.  I'm a lawyer.  I'm a creep and a tranny chaser.  Where's the...  Where's the...  All right.  We got some...  You're panicking.  Where are the radio shows that were talking about us that someone was talking about?  Mr. Maloon.  That's on...  Mr. Maloon again.  That is so fucking funny. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, check out of the paper.  It's on a separate desk.  I love it.  Travis gave you the radio shows.  I got it.  I got it.  All right, so it starts with this.  Extra.  A secret.  I guarantee you if I released that photo, he would resign.  So, how'd it get out?  A camera in the studio of New York DJ's Opie and Anthony captured the picture on Breitbart's phone.  Then they tweeted it.  Now, more questions.  Will Anthony resign?  And did Wienergate just open the door for Alec Baldwin to become the next mayor of New York City?  You're resigning?  I will not resign. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, okay.  I'm officially stating here.  I'm not resigning.  Extra gets a smiley face for not calling us shock jocks.  Extra.  It was kind of funny to see shock jock again written after many years.  To see Opie and Anthony shock jocks Opie and Anthony.  What?  Really?  Yeah, that's why I started my dumb video.  Hey, guys.  Shock jock.  Opie here.  Is that us really, shock jock?  Uh, hardball.  The underlying conduct was not as bad to me as the cover-up and the lying. 
[00:39:00]  Releasing that picture of his private parts.  Well, he didn't release it.  He went on a radio show and Opie and Anthony, I think, took a picture of it and they released it.  What?  What are you talking about?  Never mind.  Do you think...  What?  What?  She really didn't handle it well.  Shit.  And then, um...  I'm not a fan of Ed Schultz, I'll be honest with you.  Who's Ed Schultz?  He's just a blowhard.  Blowhard. 
[00:39:30]  Is he a windbag?  I love that.  He's a blowhard.  He's a blowhard.  That's your Ed Schultz.  And I would probably lean more his way if I had to admit it, but I don't care that much  to admit that shit, but he's just a blowhard.  He's kind of trying to do a Rush Limbaugh thing for the other side.  Oh, no.  That trick never works.  I don't like Ed Schultz at all.  Does he talk to his own voice?  So, The Convenient Avenue, Breitbart passed around the...  By the way, I say that without knowing what he said, I swear.  Yeah.  He has hair like Nicholson in fucking A Few Good Men. 
[00:40:00]  He looks like Nicholson, but fatter, if that's possible in that movie.  Look at his face.  He's like...  If you needed a definition of a blowhard, he's that.  Oh, he really is.  Larry Flint hair.  A windbag.  A windbag.  So, The Convenient Avenue, Breitbart passed around the X-rated photo, and don't you know,  the photo was later tweeted by Opie and Anthony, and they are, of course, claiming one of their  viewers did from the stream.  Breitbart is crying foul, saying that Opie and Anthony, well, they violated his trust. 
[00:40:30]  Sure, Breitbart.  You just let Opie and Anthony do your dirty work.  Can you plug...  Next, Republican hypocrisy on sex scandals.  You know, this fucking...  This is why you have to hate people who are obsessed with agenda.  What that guy just said is 100% raw.  I talked to Breitbart privately last night.  Yeah.  He was not fucking happy.  He's like, my fucking...  He encouraged me.  He's like, my integrity to a fault... 
[00:41:00]  Dude, he was...  How long did I stand outside the...  My sushi was rotting.  I'm outside the restaurant talking to him.  He was freaking out.  Me and Jimmy had a play date after Book of Mormon.  My girl goes home to get back with the kid, and me and Jimmy had sushi, and I'm sitting  there by myself like my date left me.  Believe me, I understand.  I was out at my table in my yard while my trainer was sitting inside waiting for me to  get off the phone, because I was on the phone with Andrew, and he was not a happy camper. 
[00:41:30]  He didn't say, let's spin this.  He was like, I feel like I did not want this out.  I gave my word.  He was not happy.  Ed Schultz is a blowhard.  I told you.  He gets shit wrong.  He's got an agenda.  He either just has it wrong, or he lied, or he just doesn't want it.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe he just doesn't know the facts.  But Ed Schultz, you're 100% wrong on that.  He conveniently spun it.  Simple as that.  Ed called me yesterday, and I was whispering. 
[00:42:00]  I'm like, hello?  And he's like, what are you doing?  I'm like, I'm under my covers.  I'm hiding.  I'm hiding.  And you went, Andrew, you go, Andrew called me.  I'm like, well, you should hide, too, then.  Hide.  Just hide and hope it goes away.  Wait.  Hannity.  Let's see how Hannity handled this last night.  Now, this afternoon, the X-rated self-portrait that was allegedly taken by Wiener and sent to a 26-year-old woman in Texas suddenly emerged on the Internet. 
[00:42:30]  Now, the picture was posted by Opie and Anthony of the Opie and Anthony radio show, who later revealed that the graphic photo was captured off of conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart's mobile phone by a video camera at the Opie and Anthony studio.  Now, Breitbart later told Fox News that he was, quote, mortified by the post, saying it was done without his permission, even calling it, quote, a complete violation of trust.  Now, regardless of all that, let's be clear.  There is now pornographic photos of Anthony Wiener floating around the Internet, and that's when the United States member of Congress. 
[00:43:00]  Mom, I think Hannity got it right.  Whoops.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  I think Hannity got it right.  Didn't he say on the air that he offered to show me the photo?  Didn't he say that at one point?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I heard.  He had offered to show Hannity the picture, and Hannity didn't want to see it.  Hannity was afraid that he would, like, be compared size-wise.  I'm just speculating.  He did not want to partake.  He's a straight-laced guy. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, but I don't understand that.  If you're a guy and a guy goes, look, I got the photo.  I got the photo.  You have to look.  Very Christian.  Yeah.  But how do you not look?  It's offensive to him.  And then maybe, I don't know.  His ideals.  Maybe go to a church afterwards.  But how do you not look if someone goes, look, I got the photo everyone's talking about.  How inside your body do you say, I, I, I, no.  It doesn't, I talked to him after his show quite a few times.  He's a goody two-shoes.  Yeah, yeah.  He really is.  Like, even in private chats, like, he'll say, oh, your act is so naughty, we enjoyed it. 
[00:44:00]  But he's like a goody, he's like a goody gumdrop.  He doesn't do anything.  He's not a fuddy-duddy, though, right?  No, not at all, no.  He's fierce.  He's fierce, actually.  Uh, Stephen Colbert.  I'm trying to do the decent thing here and not release the photo.  I'm doing this to save his family, okay?  That is called ethics, folks.  And today, this good man cemented his journalistic credibility by appearing on America's most trusted 
[00:44:30]  name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Most trusted name in news.  Wow.  Ha, ha, ha.  Colbert.  That's hilarious.  It puts him in the I'm his category.  Oh, is that funny?  The two guys that got it completely right.  Oh, that's fucking funny. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  But he didn't get it right.  This is not the most trusted name in news.  Oh, literal Jim.  Name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Where he bravely resisted their request to show the photo.  I think you can just see the photo.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't see the photo.  I don't see Jimmy.  You want it?  Ha, ha, ha.  I can't go on.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Holy shit.  I haven't heard any of this.  I just had to blow all this off yesterday and just chill. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, that is great.  And then go to Book of Mormon.  Oh, man.  I missed some fun stuff last night.  Oh, no.  I think you can just see the photo.  I mean, I don't know.  It's a little shit.  Let's see Jimmy.  You want it?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure you want it, Opie and Anthony.  Too bad.  This man has staked his reputation on the moral choice to keep this private for the man's family.  That's the famous.  That's the real one?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Okay, he didn't resist for long.  But you've got to think, that thing's burned a hole in his pocket. 
[00:46:00]  Speaking of which, here's the photo.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Okay, it's a little blurry.  I wish it was blurrier, frankly.  It's blurry because it's a phone photo that Andrew Breitbart had his phone that Opie and Anthony then took a phone photo of.  But you get the idea.  Oh, that is, that is hilarious. 
[00:46:30]  Do you want to respond to Colbert?  What has happened here?  Can I say, in the light of all, we got everyone laughing today, man.  I hope they thank us.  That Colbert.  That reassures me.  Did you tweet that?  No.  Michael, I will die.  I mean, never tweeted.  I'm not on Facebook.  I will die. 
[00:47:00]  Hanging in there.  All right, Pat, here's the story.  We're making everyone happy today.  That's hilarious.  How did that guy just kill with that unfunny statement?  I'm not on Facebook and Twitter.  They're fucking howling.  I don't have steel-belted radials.  They're acting like he just farted into the mouth of a quadriplegic or something, which  would make me laugh.  I have eggs in my mouth.  I am tired.  Oh, sleepy.  I am pooped.  Wide awake since yesterday.  Yeah.  I couldn't sleep.  You didn't sleep?  No, I was too excited, but the day was too bad. 
[00:47:30]  We ate too late.  I ate sushi too late.  Oh, I was out cold.  I was fucking hanging out by the pool, nice glass of wine, when I get the call from Red  Eye, and they're like, hey, we'd like you to come in and do at least the opening segment  for the show.  And I'm like, you know what?  Anything for my godfather.  I was like, you know what?  Yeah, I'll do it up.  They're like, okay, we'll send a car. 
[00:48:00]  So I'm like, well, that's cool.  They sent a car?  Well, then I got a call and said, we really don't have enough time for the car because  they called me pretty late.  Right.  So I was like, you know what?  I'll fucking, I'll cruise in.  That's fine.  So I drove in, did the show, drove right the fuck back out.  We're going to have that audio after the break.  And interestingly enough, a guest on the panel last night, Paul Mercurio.  Fuck that guy!  He was actually very cool. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, he's fine.  He was good.  He was actually very cool.  He called me when I was driving home.  We had a pretty good chat on the way home.  And yeah, I think it'd be very cool to have him back on the show.  And, you know, I was like, no, you're an asshole.  No, we should have, Ma.  We've talked about that before.  We should have, Ma.  It's been so long.  I was like, just have it.  I go, we could have you come on.  And the second you walk in, just play that, oh, church music.  And just keep turning the screws on him. 
[00:49:00]  You know, I have no problem with the guy.  And his juicy lips.  And I don't either.  He's kissable, but I have no problem with it.  Other than the fact that I just want to grab his cheeks and give him a peck square on the  old lipperos.  But it was funny, like having him on the panel.  In the middle of another controversy.  Yeah, yeah.  I had been, they put me downstairs where Andy Levy usually sits.  Right.  Andy had to sit there.  And then like right when they cut Andy off, I had to jump in Andy's seat.  They're plugging me in real quick.  That's cool, man.  And then I was sitting in Andy's seat, which was kind of cool. 
[00:49:30]  Andy Levy, who's fucking hysterical.  I love Andy Levy.  He should be bigger than he is.  He's on his way, though.  He's hysterical.  I don't care for him.  You don't care for Andy Levy?  Not at all.  He's mean.  He's mean-spirited.  Greg, you know, it's funny.  I called Greg last night.  And he's a smart guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He picked apart this, not just this piece, but the whole thing.  He's a really bright guy.  He should be bigger than he is, too.  He'll be moving up in the world, too.  He's getting very much.  Although that red eye, obviously, is a big show. 
[00:50:00]  I've heard so.  Getting a lot of respect.  They like being a little bit under the radar at Fox.  Oh, remember those days?  Yeah, under the radar.  Actually, under the radar is the best fucking place to get your dirty work done.  Yeah.  We have a tough time doing anything now.  They do a podcast, too, now.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm not sure if it's every day.  It might be.  But it's in the afternoon.  A little podcast where they kind of maybe give a little preamble to what they'll be talking about that night. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  Just about anything, anything pops up.  It's kind of, you know, Greg's Day.  Right.  You know, Andy or Bill, something like that.  But it's really an entertaining podcast if you can catch it.  We'll play the audio of Ann on Red Eye after the break.  But we move on here with some of the news.  This is just some of the news coverage.  Now it's, where are we at?  Elliot Spitzer.  Oh, my God.  What did he have to say about this?  Spitzer.  A blogger, Andrew Breitbart, promised he wouldn't release, has now gotten out. 
[00:51:00]  Breitbart, who first broke the story, was on the satellite radio show Opie and Anthony this morning  and passed around a cell phone image of the explicit shot,  all the while reiterating he doesn't want the photo to be distributed.  Take a listen.  By the way, I'm not releasing it.  I'm not releasing it.  I can't think of any other publication that wouldn't.  I could probably get a gazillion hits off my page.  I'm not doing that to him and his family.  That's my stated position. 
[00:51:30]  You're awesome for that.  Thank you.  Seriously.  That's awesome.  Yet now it is, in fact, all over the Internet.  See, we'll do that.  See, I know he wouldn't do that for the sake of the family.  We will.  But he couldn't have been, like, the guys that are saying that he lied,  it's like, what he did wasn't the brightest move, like, as far as keeping it secret,  but it wasn't dishonest.  And it's like, when they're killing him for being, if they say, hey, man, that was an ass move,  all right, fine.  But when they're saying he's being dishonest, that is how they spit it. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  And it's like, there's audio proving that he wasn't lying, and it doesn't matter.  They don't care.  No.  No, they don't.  Spitzer talked to Breitbart, so now Breitbart enters the story.  Yes.  Late in the day yesterday, because I think he flew back to L.A., right?  Yeah, and this is where he said that I, here on Greta, he said that I had assured him.  And rightly so.  And it was in the Hollywood Reporter, too.  Oops.  Yeah.  I'll let Andrew Breitbart explain.  He joins me now live from Los Angeles in an exclusive primetime interview.  Andrew, thank you for joining us. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you, Elliot.  Well, let me ask you the question directly.  As you can imagine, a lot of people are saying that when you showed the host of the radio show  that shot on your iPhone or phone, whatever form it is,  you must have known that one of the cameras in the studio would pick it up  and then somehow it would get out.  Is that an accurate assessment or not?  Actually, no, it's not an accurate assessment.  In fact, if you listen to more of the tape that you just played,  Jim Norton, who works for the show, assures me that there are no cameras. 
[00:53:00]  I've never said that I wouldn't show it to people.  In fact, I was on the Sean Hannity radio show,  and he joked about with me about he was the one person that didn't want to look at the photo.  The photo is proof, and it's proof of something that people still to this day,  including Joan Walsh and Bill Press, who went on MSNBC, doubting that the picture even exists. 
[00:53:30]  Right now, we find out that there are publishers like Gawker that would take this photo and publish it.  My website refuses to publish this photo.  They have admitted that they took this photo surreptitiously.  They said they did it without my knowledge.  They even said that there were no cameras there.  So, you should talk to SiriusXMU and ask why their employees were misrepresenting the truth in that room. 
[00:54:00]  Andrew, this may surprise a lot of people.  I'm absolutely willing to take your word for that on this issue right now.  No dispute from me.  You haven't taken that photo and used it for a whole number of purposes for which you could,  and so there it is.  Let's put that aside.  Yeah, of course you agree.  Like, please, any time a photo doesn't get out or a fucking story or maybe hookers or things.  And Jimmy was telling the truth there as far as there's no camera because of the angle. 
[00:54:30]  Andrew, you've got to explain.  When I said that to him, it wasn't.  Jimmy was telling the truth at that moment.  I know this sounds a little weird, but it really was.  Jimmy did not think that his phone, Breitbart's phone, was going to start being passed around at that point.  He thought it was going to be D'Onofrio and himself, Jimmy, seeing the picture.  And there wasn't a camera on that angle at all.  We thought Andrew was just going to, I'm just going to reiterate, hold up his phone to Vincent and Jimmy.  I'm thinking we're going to see the photo eventually, maybe after the show. 
[00:55:00]  I knew we were going to see the photo no matter what.  So when Jimmy said there's no camera, he was absolutely telling the truth to Andrew Breitbart.  There was no cameras in that area.  Once it made the turn to me, now we're all fucking, now we're all videoed.  As soon as it makes that turn, yeah, Ant's right.  Now you're in a world of cameras because you got Sam right there.  You got me being an idiot picking up my fucking phone.  There was another camera, let's just say. 
[00:55:30]  But when you said there were no cameras, there officially weren't at that part of the room.  But like, because why would I say, like, why would I say there are no cameras in this room knowing every cell phone has a camera on it?  And knowing that Sam was standing there videotaping the whole thing.  Oh, there's a little more.  What happened?  Oh, he would never post a picture himself and insist he wasn't in on it.  My website refuses to publish this photo. 
[00:56:00]  They have admitted that they took this photo surreptitiously.  They said they did it without my knowledge.  They even said that there were no cameras there.  It's a chance you take, though, when you...  Passing around an iPhone with a picture.  Right, of the picture.  Kate Baldwin live from Washington with more on the growing list of representatives calling for Wiener to quit the house.  See, the, uh...  Good morning, Kate.  Good morning.  And again, to reiterate, I would never say there are no cameras.  It was almost like if I was to say there were no cameras in this room with Sam standing there with a video camera, 
[00:56:30]  I would sound like I was mentally retarded.  You would need Jedi mindshare.  There are no cameras in this room.  There are no cameras in the room.  There are no cameras in this room with a picture of that oddly colored man with the fucking Walona hairdo filming from eight feet away.  You're not seeing a camera.  Yeah.  I'm not seeing a camera.  But in fairness, when I talked to him, he's like, okay, I believe you.  And he didn't argue.  When I explained it, he understood it.  And you were, uh...  And Jimmy was technically out of this one because it all went down after you left the studio. 
[00:57:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, and I don't have the mind being in it.  I just didn't want to be accused of something I didn't do.  I mean, the facts are the facts.  You would have absolutely stayed behind and been part of this.  But the show is over.  You left just assuming that's it.  Yeah, I had another interview.  You saw the photo and that's it.  Andrew's going to go fly back to L.A. and nothing else is going to happen.  Well, Jimmy did...  All hell broke loose after Jimmy left.  But Jimmy was in the studio and we were all in the studio when the camera, when his phone, when Breitbart's phone, did pass by a live cam. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  That was on the show.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  But then after the show, during the wonderful Sam Roberts after show, that's when everything started happening.  And it's like, all right, tweetage, tweetage, tweetage.  The value, though, of videotaping, I will pat myself on the back.  I have been obsessive.  It's important.  Yes.  Geez, look at this, too.  Yes.  And you know what?  What happened?  That part yesterday was saying, after the show, he was saying, like, well, you know, I thought all the news people would be all over me today, but pretty much, you know, they've laid off. 
[00:58:00]  There's nothing really going on.  It's like, see?  He likes the news.  He likes being on the news.  And then all of a sudden, boom, he's back on every fucking news thing.  So, boy, are they asking for that wiener to fucking leave after yesterday, aren't they?  Well, you know what?  Oh, anything we could do to...  We're not even...  That photo is not going to...  I'll tell you one thing.  The sexting that's coming out, all the details from these women, they keep... 
[00:58:30]  It's like what Tiger Woods happened.  This photo is one piece of it, but it's not what's going to get them to resign.  It is one piece of it, but let me tell you something.  When Nancy Pelosi has to take a look at a turgid, veiny hard-on with shaved balls, knowing that it's Anthony Wieners,  she does not want him around, especially during, you know, elections.  So, I'd say bye-bye for Wieners.  Oh, elections. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, elect...  Yes.  Erections.  Let's go to Greta Van Sustrand.  Greta Van Sustrand.  This treat.  More bad news tonight for Congressman Anthony Wiener.  That naked crotch shot he took of himself is now all over the Internet.  Shock jocks, Opie Nathany...  Go blow yourself.  Shock jack.  Go blow yourself.  Shock jack.  She doesn't write the copy, though.  She just reads it.  She's not writing the copy. 
[00:59:30]  She doesn't.  I don't think she...  That's an old-school stupid term.  There's nothing shocking about this show other than the fact that we're employed.  Cub reporter.  Yeah.  Greta Van Sustrand.  Opie Nathany got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  They snapped a shot of the picture from journalist Andrew Breitbart's cell phone.  But Breitbart says they did it without his permission.  As you know, Breitbart runs BigGovernment.com, the website that first reported Congressman Wiener's Twitter scandal.  So what happened?  BigGovernment.com editor Andrew Breitbart joins us. 
[01:00:00]  Andrew, nice to see you.  And how did this picture hit the Internet?  I went on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm friends with one of the guys on there, Jim Norton.  I just befriended...  What about Anthony?  He was about to say, I just befriended Anthony.  Befriended.  Oh, I do feel bad about that.  It was fun to hang out with.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Hopefully you get that back together.  Yeah, maybe in time.  I think it'll be all right.  Joe, I'm friends with one of the guys on there, Jim Norton. 
[01:00:30]  I just befriended Anthony the other night, and I just decided before I went to the airport,  why not stop in for some hijinks before I get on the airport, out to the airport.  And I went in there, did a long interview with them.  I thought everything went great.  They took a picture with me afterwards.  But during the interview, they asked me if they could see it.  I said, well, make sure you don't show it to anyone. 
[01:01:00]  You pulled his fly down.  And Jim Norton said, there aren't any cameras here.  And so I felt very comfortable that nothing bad would happen with it.  And next thing I know, I found out that they surreptitiously recorded it and tweeted it on the Internet.  And they've subsequently said, admitted, that they did so without my permission.  And it's very troubling because for an employee of Sirius XMU to say there are no cameras here, 
[01:01:30]  and then you find out that there are cameras here, and they're going against their word and taping it,  it's deeply problematic.  No, it's not.  And why is he blaming an indie rock channel?  Sirius XMU.  Sirius XMU.  Has never got promotion like this.  Yes.  Is that a Rob Cross channel?  That's his baby.  Wow.  Sirius XMU is in deep trouble.  Rob Cross and his copics.  Isn't that an indie rock channel or something like that? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it's like the college.  It's like the Sirius equivalent to the college radio channel.  He's just trying to clear his name.  He's not trying to get anybody.  Everybody in Brooklyn listens to it.  Yeah.  What is Howard talking about today?  He's got a Jessica Hahn interview from, I think, 1990, I think, is what's on that channel today.  Just because someone was asking, that's all.  No need to.  Sirius XMU is getting all this press.  Actually, Richard Simmons, it's an interview with Richard Simmons congratulating Howard on the birth of one of his daughters. 
[01:02:30]  Is it a rerun?  And that daughter's now 20-something.  Is it a rerun?  Yeah, he's not here.  He took a week off and he did his three days this week.  God, that would be so nice.  I so wanted to take today off.  I didn't.  Fuck.  I came in early today.  Yeah, you did.  I took a shower.  You were here at 6.05.  Normally, I walk in, believe me, as Ecstasy of the Gold is wrapping up, I'm fucking... 
[01:03:00]  Ecstasy of the Gold.  Of the Gold.  Ecstasy of the Gold.  Of the Gold.  That's what it's called.  No, it's not.  What's it called?  Ecstasy of Gold.  Just Ecstasy of Gold.  Ecstasy of Gold?  You don't have to put...  Ecstasy of the Gold.  The Ecstasy of the Gold.  Ecstasy of Gold.  It's on one of my favorite programs.  I thought it was Ecstasy of the Gold.  All these years, I've been kicking women in the pussy for correcting me.  You're a jack of the ass.  Yeah, well, you're a hat of the hat rack. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know.  It's tired.  Ecstasy of Gold.  Yeah.  Breitbart, or Breitbart, continues with Greta.  Ugh.  All right, I know that...  Ugh is for Greta.  I like Greta.  Sexy name.  She took Ozzie and Sharon to the White House Correspondents.  You like Greta?  I do.  She hung out with Ozzie.  I'll always like her.  All right, I know that you maintain the pictures because right when the story broke at first  is that there was an effort to make less of you or to try to discredit you when it was 
[01:04:00]  first denied that he had sent this picture on the Twitter, the one in the underwear, that  shot.  So I understand why you kept the pictures, but why are they on your phone?  I mean, on my phone, I got like 75 of the pictures of my cats and dogs, but why do you  have this on your phone?  It's because it was sent to me from the source.  Um, I have, I have all the photos were sent to me and, uh, email is how you get it and 
[01:04:30]  you read email and that's where it is.  So it's not like I had it up as a wallpaper.  It goes right to a dog licking the pussy joke.  I know.  It's nothing original.  Why would she photograph the jars?  I know.  You would keep that under your hat.  You wouldn't carry pictures of the jars.  You could have your dogs and cats on the phone, but then like, oh, a dog, a cat.  Why a Skippy jar? 
[01:05:00]  Why is there a jar of Skippy here, Greta?  Oh, I meant to delete that one.  Why are there scratch marks through the word Skippy with a, with a, with a little fellow  was eagerly trying to take the lid off, but he can't cause he's a fucking canine.  Why are you on Amazon buying oven mitts at discount in quantity?  Oven mitts.  That dog hates oven mitts.  His four little dog booties.  Walking all funny, goose stepping with his front little paws because he doesn't like the  duct tape on his hands holding the oven mitts on. 
[01:05:30]  so as not to scratch her hips with his dewclaw.  I don't know.  Look, to clear it up, I'm not, I don't know if Greta lets a dog lick her vagina with peanut  butter on it.  I'm not, I don't know.  Oh, if she doesn't, she should.  I'm sure it's wonderful.  I know I would.  It probably is. 
[01:06:00]  If I had a vagina, I would.  I would love a dog to lick my asshole for a few minutes.  You know how great that would feel?  That big tongue.  And they just, they don't lose energy either.  They never lose interest.  They just want to lick.  And as, as the flavor ran out, he would just dig deeper for more.  You'd feel that probing, stupid dog tongue.  Just get him on a good panting day.  Yeah.  You'd see a dog trying to get like the last bit of dog food out of a can at the bottom  and they're really digging.  That's what it would be after it was all off your cheeks. 
[01:06:30]  You'd feel his tongue burrow into your ass and then you'd feel his stupid cold nose on  your tailbone.  I hope some of the media has just tuned in.  I really do.  We're talking about dogs eating our asses.  What are you thinking of apples, papers and TV outlets?  Keep writing.  Yeah.  Holy shit, that's funny.  Get that transcript out immediately.  Oh boy.  Yes.  Yes, we tuned in.  That's what you want to tune into.  Your dogs really do burrow those noses in, don't they? 
[01:07:00]  They love it.  All wet and cold.  Do you think a dog would dig in your asshole for a couple minutes?  Oh, dude.  So deep.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You get that, CNN?  Yeah.  And thank God he has oven mitts on because he would try pawing your ass cheeks apart  like dirt.  He has.  Scratching.  Oh, fuck.  What a weird day.  All right.  Listen.  I gotta eat.  That was off your cheeks.  We're gonna eat. 
[01:07:30]  When we get back.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's eat and then we'll come back.  Anthony came back to the city to do Red Eye.  We got that audio for everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From Brown Eye to Red Eye.  Yeah.  We got radio guys talking about us including Todd Schnitt, Rush Limbaugh, and Sean Hannity.  I hear Todd Schnitt is a real douchebag.  I don't want to tangle with him.  Is he a douchebag?  Is he around here?  No, he's in.  I'm gonna guess Florida.  Yeah.  We just, actually, I'm just simulcasting.  Oh, yeah.  Great. 
[01:08:00]  We're the same agent?  Of course we do.  Do we?  That's what I was just told.  But he, uh.  All right.  Well, I don't know what he said, but he said some shit.  He has the word schnit, like rhymes with certain things.  Yeah.  Like schnit or whatever.  Like he's.  Does he do some, uh.  Talking schnit, like that type stuff.  He does that, you think?  I think it's, I looked at his thing yesterday.  What is his problem?  He would do the exact same thing.  But he didn't.  That's his problem.  Yeah, that's his problem.  E-Rock knows this shit.  Wasn't he part of kind of a.  Schnit list.  Well.  The schnit list.  Yeah, well.  He's a schnit dick. 
[01:08:30]  A schnit dick.  What show was he part of for a while before he went on his own?  He.  Pitler and schnit.  Schnit and a head.  He had a morning show in Tampa called MJ and BJ.  Okay.  It is MJ and BJ.  Oh.  These guys did exactly what we did.  I know exactly what's going on here.  I just figured it out.  A lot of the quote, and I hate when they use it, but we'll say it for this, shock jocks.  Shock jocks.  Couldn't adjust to the environment and radio. 
[01:09:00]  So they moved on from being shock jocks.  And now they're kind of, now they're trying to be mainstream and they're trying to be political and all that crap.  And I want to forget that they were in the shock jock category.  Yeah.  MJ and BJ would have absolutely fucking tweeted this photo.  Yeah.  I don't even know these guys, but I remember their show.  I know their show.  They absolutely would have.  Yeah.  Mancow would have absolutely tweeted this photo before he decided to be high and mighty and Christian and political.  Fake morality that they pour on after, you know, doing all kinds of, let's fucking pour shit over this girl's tits and have her pick up money with them. 
[01:09:30]  Exactly.  His partner, BJ, left him like 10 years ago, so it's just been, he does this morning show as MJ Kelly, and then in the afternoon he does a political talk show under his real name.  There you go.  I really wish people could see Eric right now because he has a fucking, a three-month Nicholson shining beard.  It's a creepy beard.  Yeah, let me see.  Yeah, you should be rubbing Danny's head, assuring him that you won't axe attack him. 
[01:10:00]  God, yeah, look at that.  What is that, growing a beard or just growing lazy?  Lazy, huh?  Lazy.  Yeah, just a little lazy.  Are we going to get into the Fez thing later?  I think we should.  Got to get into that.  It's a controversy, Bruin.  He had some words.  It sure is.  Huh?  He had words.  I don't like when there's tension between the shows.  Never tension between us and the Ronnie B.  Well, you know, peripheral, the little Roland thing.  All right, well.  I figure Roland's a member of our family.  That's right. 
[01:10:30]  As of yesterday, anyway.  Well, we got more on the Wiener thing after the break.  We're going to eat now.  And more news reports coming in.  Danny just handed a couple more over.  Cool.  This show fucking is an easy one today, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Also, Josh Gad in studio later.  He's pretty much one of, I should say.  One of the stars.  One of the stars of Book of Mormon.  The Book of Mormon.  Ensemble cast.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yes.  Ensemble.  There's a colored girl in this that sings her. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, Jesus.  That's not the thing.  I think my name is, I want to say Nicky St. James.  What happened?  I think it's African-American.  Yeah, it's not the one.  Oh, that's right.  Everyone's listening today.  That was a joke.  That's what we say.  Hold on.  Her name is Nicky something.  She could sing her ass off.  Yeah, she is.  Nicky M. James.  She's fantastic.  She's unbelievable.  All right.  We'll break here.  Yes.  And we'll continue with this shit.  Stay there.  Yeah, we're back with the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[01:11:30]  A lot of news coming in about this very show.  They said in Chicago that they, it's got something to do with next Wednesday, the Anti-Social Network  being there, opening night of the Comedy Festival.  Hear the real story of what happened next Wednesday night with myself, Brewer.  Brewer and a tell.  That's a good one.  That's perfect.  And this just in.  Now, there's this. 
[01:12:00]  A photo of Congressman Wiener's private parts is on the web, thanks in part to the congressman  himself, apparently.  He allegedly took and then sent the photo to one of the women he had an online relationship  with.  She sent it to conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart, who showed it on the O.B. and Anthony  satellite radio show, but said he didn't want it released.  O.B. and Anthony's studio surveillance cam recorded the shot, and they put it out there 
[01:12:30]  for the world to see.  Wow.  Who's that?  For the world to see.  C.W. 11 here in New York City.  Ah.  So what do you want to do?  You want to go radio shows, or you want to go Anne on Red Eye?  While we mix and match it and do both.  We're going to do both, but which one do you want to do first?  I say a little Anne on Red Eye because, uh, brings some humor to the situation?  Hopefully.  I hope so, right?  Let's keep our fingers crossed.  That was, uh...  So Ant, uh, raced back into the city last night.  Raced!  To, uh, tape Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld and Andy Levy. 
[01:13:00]  That's right, I'm not passing up a chance to be a Fox shill.  Are you a Fox shill now?  A Fox shill.  Of course.  We've got to find out exactly what happened with the picture this morning.  Joining us is Anthony Cumia, one half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie, so what?  Anthony, sorry.  Why is that so difficult?  Who looks like a stupid Opie and who looks Italian?  He's like... 
[01:13:30]  No, he knew he just mixed it up, obviously.  We've got to get a montage, too, of all the, um, news reporters today.  They just can't say Opie and Anthony.  Opie and...  Opie and...  Because they're rushing forward past the end.  Yeah, they just can't say it.  Opie and...  Anthony, sorry.  I've only known you for, like, four years.  What is...  That's okay, d***.  I've been doing that...  What'd you say there?  I called him...  I said, that's okay, d***. 
[01:14:00]  I go, oh, I've been saying that all day.  Sorry.  What's wrong with that?  I don't know.  It's a great line.  They get a little crazy.  Because they're not, uh...  They're starting to get on the radar.  They try, yeah, yeah.  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Watch that fox thing over there.  That's okay, d***.  I'm great.  I've been doing that all day.  I deserve that.  I apologize.  What is it like to be a horrible, horrible person?  Uh, I'm used to it.  I'll tell you that.  Just...  Just ask Mercurio. 
[01:14:30]  You should repent.  You should go to church or repent for what you did.  Yeah, I hear you.  So, you know, Breitbart says that the picture was released without his permission.  You agree with that, right?  Yeah, I'll agree it was released without his permission.  But, uh...  You know, when you take a chunk of meat into a lion's den, someone's gonna take a bite.  Uh, I understand, um...  Yeah, I understand if he was on Hannity. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  That's one thing.  But, uh, the Opie and Anthony show, not quite known for its newsworthiness.  Now you're talking like you don't know us.  Yeah, yeah, I'm a third person.  Third person.  The Opie and Anthony...  You're like Wolf Blitzer and the rest of them right now.  Yeah, yeah, I was doing third person.  Opie and Anthony show.  Bill O'Reilly.  Uh, I see these guys, uh, getting thrown off the air for this.  I, uh, yeah.  You wear a couple hats yourself, sir.  Yes.  But, uh, the Opie and Anthony show, not quite known for its newsworthiness. 
[01:15:30]  Known for its underhandedness.  The picture was shown.  We did ask to see it, uh, for proof that it was actually, uh, that it existed.  And, um, uh, somehow, I think 8,000 cameras went off.  Uh, when this, uh, picture was shown.  Um, and it did make its way to, uh, to Twitter.  Um, albeit in a more pixelated state than the pristine version that was on Breitbart's phone. 
[01:16:00]  Uh, but, um, I think it got the idea that, uh, it was there.  Yes.  Damn.  Very good job.  Yeah, you know, you gotta.  I like the lion's thing.  Yeah, yeah.  The meat and the lions.  That's what it is.  You know, we are what we are.  People, uh, there's that old adage about the, uh, alligator, and he offers a little ride  across a, across a, uh, river to, I believe it's a little, a little mammal of some type 
[01:16:30]  on his back.  And he convinces them.  Is the alligator's name Richard Gere?  Yes.  And he convinces this, this little animal, uh, that he's not going to eat him.  He goes, don't worry, I'm not going to eat you.  I'll take you across the river.  And after all the convincing, the animal climbs on the alligator's back and the alligator  starts taking him across the river.  And in the middle of the river, he looks back and he opens his mouth to eat him.  And the little mammal's like, oh, what are you doing?  What do you want? 
[01:17:00]  You said you weren't going to eat me.  He goes, hey, I'm an alligator.  See, I felt, I've heard the same story where it's a guy, a scorpion's injured.  And the guy picks him up to like help heal him or whatever.  And, uh, this, and he, and he heals the scorpion.  He fixes him because his leg is broken.  Yes.  And the scorpion stings him.  And he goes, well, why did you sting me?  I helped you.  And he said, well, you knew I was a scorpion when you picked me up.  I'm a scorpion. 
[01:17:30]  So it's like, I use that same logic.  Every time a fucking girl has a burning vagina after sex, of course I have chlamydia.  You know, I was a piece of garbage when you answered my text.  Jesus.  That's what this show is.  You come in.  It's like, we'd like to say, you know, hey, we'll do the right thing.  This will happen.  That'll happen.  The right thing.  But then it's the Opie and Anthony show.  We've done the right thing a few times. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Well, the alligator has too, I'm sure.  Sure.  But, you know, he's hungry.  You raised a good point.  You said, uh, because the little animal, you said, if you bring me into a lion's den and  mom says, I'm like, I got a face like a lion.  Oh, you dummy.  That's Edgar.  Pull the tacks out of your map and stick them in your face.  Exactly.  You have a face like there's a lot of booze in that womb.  Was that Edgar?  No, that was Rocky Dennis.  Rocky Dennis.  They sounded a little Edgar-ish.  Edgar's up.  My teeth are dry.  Yeah, yeah.  That's more Edgar.  And Eugene is like Edgar, but with a southern accent. 
[01:18:30]  He's like, oh, get the Lord into your life.  You really need to do that.  Hey, come here, girl.  Oh, that was good.  Okay.  I heard the accent there.  Yeah, I'll smack you on the name, please.  I see the difference there.  And his hands touch.  He always touches with his fingernails.  Are Edgar and Eugene brothers?  They are.  Okay.  Edgar and Eugene Mellencamp.  Mellencamp.  You didn't go with Mellencamp.  That's their name.  Why would you go Mellencamp?  That's their name.  It's just what it is.  It is what it is.  All right. 
[01:19:00]  He was explaining all his characters to my wife last night.  Yeah.  Well, there's so many of them.  It's kind of creepy to get the explanation.  Really creepy.  Yeah.  I, I, uh, I remember, ah, never mind.  I don't know how to say what I was about to say.  My chick and I would argue.  Okay.  And it was funny.  I remember you and your chick.  And she would say things like, like we were talking about whatever.  And literally, I would just go like, yeah, and then you got to do this or something.  And she would just go like, Chip, would you shut the fuck up?  You're always butting in. 
[01:19:30]  Like she literally would address Chip.  Chip and not you.  It was the greatest how annoyed she would get at Chip.  And when I finally stopped doing, I finally stopped doing Eugene because she, she literally  would take my face with her fingernails and scratch it.  And she's like, when, since you've stopped doing Eugene, I like you better as a person.  Wow.  Like Eugene was going to ruin the relationship.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is fun for the radio show.  But one day I drove home with him and his girl and, uh, me and Kenny in the, you know,  in the front seat and he's talking to her and all these characters and she's not acting. 
[01:20:00]  She's talking back to the characters.  And I'm like, there's no radio mics on, no video cameras.  They're just, this is what they do.  And it really creeped me out.  Yeah.  I'm not going to lie.  It creeped me out.  She fucked a few of the characters one night.  Uh, she fucked Chip, Uncle Paul and Sudley.  And I think Eugene jumped on or no, no, Edgar.  Do you break character in the middle of it?  No.  She just said Chip was the worst fuck.  Of course.  Uncle Paul was the best.  Sudley was just sloppy. 
[01:20:30]  Really?  All right.  Uncle Paul was a good fuck?  The best of those three.  Wow.  And you know Chip has a new club, right?  Uh.  Strip club.  Yeah.  It's not a strip club.  It's not?  It's a fancy club with like celebrities hang out.  Oh, yeah.  Scandals.  Scandals.  That was the name of the place.  Scandals.  I was telling Jimmy last night, I'm like, I gotta ask Anthony, but I think there used to  be a club on Long Island called Scandals.  Yeah.  It was like a hotel.  It was off of, uh.  That would be such a Long Island club name.  Yeah.  It was like off of a Ramada Inn or something. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  All right.  Back to Anthony on Red Eye from last night.  Yeah.  The picture of the picture made it look like a, like a kind of like a concoction from  Mr. Softy.  But it was still, it actually looked like a Super Mario character.  It was like eight pixels and, uh.  Completely shaved, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Waxed.  Uh.  No one shaves anymore, Paul.  They all waxed.  I gotta ask you.  Now, you say it kind of showed up.  I like it when everybody, you know, you use the passive kind of like, wait. 
[01:21:30]  Who, was this a group effort?  Did you guys plan this?  Did you, did you, um.  Did you plan this before Breitbart came in?  Well, a lot of people think we plan this because if you, if anyone recalls, about four years  ago, Breitbart, uh, ran with a story about a homeless guy that came in threatening to,  uh, prepare, uh, have some sexual violence.  Right.  Right.  We'll get into that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some, some people, uh, and, uh, Breitbart picked up on the story and we got suspended for 
[01:22:00]  a month.  And a lot of people are saying, oh, is this that slow Sicilian revenge Anthony?  Antonio Andolini, you know, but, but no, it had nothing to do with that.  It was a spur of the moment thing.  The picture was out there.  Yeah.  And as a matter of fact, the phone was laying on, um, the mixing board that Opie uses and  he blatantly pulled out a camera and went to take a picture and I pulled it away.  As I pulled it away, a camera picked right up on it.  Yeah.  Uh, one of the video cameras and we got a still from that. 
[01:22:30]  And once it's gone that far, oh, come on.  You might as well just go ahead.  You're absolutely right.  You might as well.  It wasn't our intention going into that whole thing yesterday.  No.  It just happens.  But then when things happen like they did, what are you going to do?  You got to think on your feet and go with it.  Right.  Uh, it continues.  I guess it was last night.  Breitbart singing, singing the praises of you. 
[01:23:00]  He looked, cause you guys, you guys bonded Monday night at a bar and you guys had a great  time.  He kept saying, I love, I love this Anthony Cumia.  I love this.  Do you feel a little bit of remorse?  I, uh, being a morning radio host, remorse is something that I haven't felt in years.  Along with, uh, hurt, love, compassion.  Wait, one time you felt remorse.  One time.  Um, no, it actually, the truth of the matter is I, I do like Andrew. 
[01:23:30]  We did have a great time, uh, after I did the show, um, Monday and, uh, I, I do feel  bad that this happened, but it was so bound to happen.  I gotta be, I gotta be honest.  Look, I, I, I'm not going to sell out my staff.  I'm not going to sell out Opie or anybody else on the Opie and Anthony show.  So this guy was showing this off like a, uh, it's like a Sosa rookie card. 
[01:24:00]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, it's wiener's wiener, wiener's wiener.  And you could pick it up on FlexPay, ladies and gentlemen, right on FlexPay with a McGuire  rookie card.  I can tell Anthony, I can tell Anthony, you are full of remorse.  He was kind of throwing it around, man.  You know, I, I saw that thing many, many times.  How many people do you think saw that picture before yesterday? 
[01:24:30]  If you had a guess between just what I saw between Monday and then here in the studio  before we ever tweeted it, a million, 8 million.  I would say, uh, I would say it had to be me personally.  I saw 15 people see it.  Yeah.  About that.  Yeah.  I was going to get out all kinds of people.  We're not backpedaling, by the way.  We did what we did.  Well, the girl in Texas had it. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Maybe she was negotiating with people.  But I mean, the thing is, if she had it, I would, I would surmise that other people had  it as well because I doubt he just sent his cock photo to one person.  I know I certainly haven't.  That's why it would have gotten out.  Yes.  I'm not saying I know that for a fact.  I'm just surmising.  Surmise.  I think sometimes you have to take the facts you have and come to a conclusion. 
[01:25:30]  How would you do that?  You surmise what you've learned.  I don't know if that's the correct word.  Of course it is.  So Paul Mercurio was on Red Eye with you last night.  Yes.  He, of course, was the one that pretty much got us fired for the Sex for Sam thing.  He was one of the spotters for Sex for Sam, one of the couples.  He kind of pumped it up that day.  Yeah, yeah.  He went around with a couple and had to call in and say where they were having sex. 
[01:26:00]  I guess we got ourselves fired, but he certainly was right the hell in there.  Yeah, he went to St. Pat's and called us up and said, hey, I'm at St. Pat's and people  are fucking.  And you're like, oh boy, oh boy, there's trouble.  He was on the panel with you last night on Red Eye, so you're going to hear Ant kind  of, you know, fuck with him a little bit.  We were, hold on, we weren't at St. Pat's.  We simply had not gone.  We had to surmise that he was summing up the events accurately. 
[01:26:30]  We'd not been there ourselves.  We were surmising that he was giving an accurate report.  Dave wants to know, ask Jimmy why Edgar and Eugene have different accents if they're  brothers.  That happens a lot.  My brother lived in Florida, Daytona Beach for 10 years.  He came back like a Southern NASCAR hit guy for a while.  You crazy?  I forget where they're from.  I think Eugene was from Arkansas. 
[01:27:00]  Mm-hmm.  Um, and I forget where Edgar was from.  I believe one of the boys was from Arkansas.  I wouldn't have to surmise if they grew up in different places.  I love how you have character development for all these, uh, characters.  I certainly do.  I'm still working on Bill Tedley.  Bill Tedley.  We don't want Bill Tedley.  Oh, Bill, with a Bill Tedley theme song.  We don't want Bill on this show.  Yes, you're going to have Bill. 
[01:27:30]  This show's going to be a hit.  But not for today.  This, from what I saw Monday and then on the show today, I knew it was bound to get out.  Now, that doesn't make any excuse that, you know, hey, it was us that did it.  Yeah.  Uh, although I do kind of like attaching ourselves to an international story.  It is the, um, credo of the shock jock.  I haven't been called a shock jock, by the way, in years.  So it is kind of nice to have that. 
[01:28:00]  I think it was since Mercurio sold us out at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  That's not, that's not.  All right, that's it.  I was giving you your moment.  That's it.  What do I need to do?  Do I need to go in the church?  You need to go in the church.  All right, so what these guys are talking about is, Opie and Anthony were suspended because  they had a promotion that encouraged people to have sex throughout New York.  Yes.  And you called in and you said, somebody's having sex in a church.  Yeah.  And that's how you guys got fired, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, uh, we will, we will continual, uh, to continually blame Paul Mercurio for sitting 
[01:28:30]  out two years paid.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hey, thanks, Paul.  Yeah.  In the end, I would have to admit that was a pretty good thing for us.  It was a nice vacation.  Oh, boy, was it.  I look back on it and it helped me too as a comic doing Tough Crowd.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really looking back.  Yeah, he went on to the Tough Crowd.  Yeah, it was, uh, it was a hell of a, hell of a time off.  And one more clip from Red Eye.  Ant says again, uh, Breitbart had nothing to do with it. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  I think when the Wikipedia page is written about this scandal, you guys then, you guys  got like at least two sentences in there.  I think, I think we did, uh, again, I, and I do have to say, Andrew really had nothing  to do with this.  Yeah.  He was, uh, he was, uh, kind of, kind of a victim in the whole thing.  Kind of like me with the church, right?  The guy, well, eh, don't, don't push it there, Paul.  Don't push it.  I'm giving you the finger under the table.  All right, I know. 
[01:29:30]  But, uh, Angie, I gotta, I gotta move on because I want to bring the crew into this.  Okay.  Thanks for coming down.  Absolutely.  And you're a horrible, horrible person.  Terrible.  Yeah, you know what?  I'm like the child in a, in a, in a, in a family where the parents are fighting.  I don't know who to side with.  Right.  You make it so hard for me, Mr. Kumiya.  Thank you, Greg Gutfeld and everyone at Red Eye.  All right, I'll see you later.  All right, Paul, you've said it.  Huh?  Uh, that's great, though.  You, you went in just for that.  Good for you, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, again, that's definitively saying, even though you're joking and being funny with 
[01:30:00]  it, that's definitively saying and truthfully saying that he really didn't know.  He didn't know.  And that's all Breitbart cares about right now is making sure people know he didn't lie.  And he didn't.  And just, you know, being the goofy fucking radio dick on, on TV like that kind of shows,  yeah, we're idiots.  Yeah.  Yes.  Because what happens is if you don't go on that program, people are left to surmise from  England and rumors.  And when you leave people to begin surmising, they're never going to surmise in your favor. 
[01:30:30]  Surmise.  Hey, uh, go to allaccess.com.  I can't.  I don't know where it's located.  It says, uh, Breitbart announced he wants to see serious fire, you guys.  Come on.  Is that really breaking right now?  Come on.  A few people are saying it?  That can't be.  What does it say there?  First of all, that ain't going to happen.  Held accountable.  Just held accountable?  That's different than being fired.  Ain't going to happen over this.  That's for sure.  Nah, I think we skate on this one, finally.  We finally skate.  There's nothing to skate for, honestly.  I know. 
[01:31:00]  What are you going to do?  All right.  Does it say he wants us fired to just...  What does it say?  What does it say?  Is it...  We're reading it.  Does it just hit all access?  What does it say?  Anything different?  Mm-hmm.  No, I figure I had a couple of shock jocks.  Same stuff, pretty much, Jimmy?  Yes, today.  Is asking SiriusXM...  Wait, go back.  Go back.  Go back.  Is asking SiriusXM to, quote, figure out how a couple of their shock jocks were able to 
[01:31:30]  or allowed to videotape him without his knowledge and capture the image of a pornographic photo  of Congressman Anthony Wiener.  Yeah, I guess they'll figure that out.  I'm sure they will.  I haven't seen a boss in days.  I wouldn't worry about it.  To say the camera was running pretty...  Much the whole show.  No, he didn't take fire.  No, he didn't take fire.  He didn't take fire.  All right. 
[01:32:00]  He just wants, you know, an internal investigation.  He wants to figure out why so he can go back and tell people this is what happened.  This is how...  Because people are saying to him, how did it get off your phone without you...  What happened?  And he wants to know how.  What happened?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We're going to do another break here because we went real long to start the show.  When we get back, some radio guys are taking their dumb little shots.  Ah, I love these.  Love these.  Do they have all the facts, Opie?  Or are they just speculating? 
[01:32:30]  That's very possible, but without the facts, they're just going to begin surmising about  what may or may not have occurred, allegedly.  You guys want breaking news before we break for a second?  I love some breaking news.  We got breaking news.  Chris in New Hampshire.  Chris?  Morning, gentlemen.  Yes.  Breaking news.  Go ahead, Chris.  Just wanted to let you guys know that your old buddy Scorch is back in the cage in front of the Verizon Center. 
[01:33:00]  No way.  Sam, you're slipping.  Pause for the cause.  Why does a listener have to tell us that Scorch is back in the cage?  I guess all this Breitbart excitement distracts us from the real issue at hand.  You're slipping.  Pause for the cause.  Pause for the cause.  Is it pause for the cause?  That's what it is.  It's me.  I'm going to be in a dog cage until we raise money for the dogs.  He invited my wife's kickboxing coach into the cage with him yesterday. 
[01:33:30]  What is going on with that guy?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Breaking news.  Scorch is back in the cage.  We'll have to kind of take a look at that.  That's correct.  A little later this morning.  Wouldn't it be under events or something?  Yeah, it could be.  Events is up there.  Well, you can win free guests for a year.  That's an awesome promotion.  Events, maybe.  Rock 101 is doing.  Pause for the cause.  Scorch is going to be.  Here it is.  Fourth annual.  Pause for the cause. 
[01:34:00]  Tomorrow's the last day.  Join Rock 101 as we lock up Scorch in a golden retriever's cage for the fourth annual Pause for the cause.  To benefit the Animal Rescue League of New Hampshire beginning June 6th at the Verizon Wireless Arena.  Scorch will once again spend one week in a cage living under the Manchester sky.  And raising as much money as he can to help out our four-legged, furry, feathered, and scaly friends that can't help themselves. 
[01:34:30]  Keep listening as we get closer to lock up for special guest seminars and other activities happening at the PFC Compound.  Look at the logo.  Instead of PFG, it's PFC.  Pause for the cause.  Pause for the cause.  Oh, I get you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I'd love to hear some of that. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, we're going to have to get audio of that soon.  Oh, please, God.  I want some audio.  We will have audio by tomorrow, right?  Okay.  Good.  We'll break.  We'll continue with this story.  We're all over the fucking place today.  Now we got radio guys talking about it.  What's going on?  Oh, nothing.  Roland wasn't exactly sure what had occurred this morning on the program.  He was asking me.  He was surmising what had happened.  And incorrectly, if I may say.  You're handing stuff out? 
[01:35:30]  He's handing me a piece of paper.  You may sit there and surmise what it is.  What's on the paper?  I have not read it yet.  So I would be surmising as well.  We would be surmising together.  Can you tell us what's on the paper after the break?  I certainly can.  It will be not a submission at that point.  Now I sound like fucking Ted.  It's Ted Cosby.  This is Camille's Emporium. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  I have not slept.  I apologize.  What's on the paper?  I'll show you in a break and then we'll kiss.  Ah, shoot.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  And now, Jimspirations.

No, it's got to be quiet.  You don't do a Jimspiration over music.  No.  Because a Jimspiration is music. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, man.  That's profound.  That's pretty deep, I think.  That is profound.  Take time to smell the roses before you're laying underneath them.  Imus got brief on.  Why is he using the neck picture?  You know that's a thorn in my fucking side.  Take time to eat the fruit out of the trees when your neck is long enough.  Could you guys get this clip?  Because Imus has been hilarious about this.  Could they get it down the hall? 
[01:38:30]  Watch him call for the firing of the show.  You're right.  That's outrageous.  We haven't talked about that picture in years, but when me and I went to XM, they wanted  to do some publicity shots, and they took a bunch of pictures of us in Washington that  day, and this fucking asshole, and I wish I remembered his name, and I did for many years,  and it's finally out of my brain.  He got kind of okay pictures, but decided, I'm really good at photoshopping.  And I begged him.  I go, do not photoshop our pictures, please. 
[01:39:00]  He goes, don't you worry about it.  I'm really good at this.  So he turns around and photoshopped.  He takes my head off one picture and puts it on another picture and didn't match up the  neck, so I got a giraffe neck.  You got a giraffe neck.  With two Adam's apples.  And we look like cartoon characters.  Right.  It doesn't look real.  No, because then I think he did some other shit with the picture.  And the makeup woman was insane and put Ronald Reagan makeup on me. 
[01:39:30]  I don't know what's going on there.  I don't even think you did that eyebrow thing.  I think he did that, too.  No, I think he did some distortion work.  Oh, my God.  So we wanted this picture to go away, and then fucking Imus just showed us.  He showed you.  I was from the other picture.  Which picture did he use of you?  The one where we're both kind of standing there, the irregular one.  Are you saying you didn't know what was going on in this picture?  No.  So right now you're just surmising what that man may or may not have done. 
[01:40:00]  Yes.  I was surmising.  I want everybody to hate that.  I was going to be using the word surmising.  Don't worry about that.  They already do.  Of course they do.  That was the one of me.  That's fine.  At least the neck looks fucking normal.  But you, they use the giraffe neckline.  Why would they do that?  Why would Imus do that to me?  The giraffe giraffe.  On top of that, one of the pictures I was smiling, but my eyes was closed. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, if you're good at photoshopping like this asshole, he goes, no problem.  I'll just open up his eyes.  Yeah.  Now, you at home, try to keep your eyes wide open and smile at the same time.  Yeah.  There's no like.  It's impossible, first of all.  And if you do get it done, you look like a complete sociopath.  That does not even resemble us.  No.  No.  That's a horrible picture.  Whatever.  What are you going to do?  One of the news channels was using footage from any W.  Fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  I love when that footage comes down.  So now when I walk the streets today, they're going to go, wow, you fucking look like shit. 
[01:41:00]  I love that one.  Oh, yeah, because you just saw me from 10 years ago on TV, you dick.  Let's get into the radio guys, because they're terrific.  Yeah.  Granted, we're radio guys, too.  But when something happens like yesterday where we get a big coup, a lot of radio guys,  certainly Imus isn't one of these guys.  He laughs and goes with it.  But then you get other radio guys that just show extreme jealousy, because they wanted  to be the ones.  Simple as that.  I don't care how they say it on the air.  They wanted to be the ones.  Yeah, when you're a radio guy, you want the big story. 
[01:41:30]  The scoop.  You want to be involved in the big story.  And then if you don't get the big scoop, then you try to spin it another way.  Yeah.  Here's Todd Schnitt.  Why would Breitbart show it to those guys?  You know, those guys are radio bullies.  Oh, go fuck yourself, Todd.  But are we really radio bullies?  Why are we radio bullies, Todd?  First of all, what is that?  A radio bully. 
[01:42:00]  What's a radio bully?  God, a bully.  Radio bullies.  What year is this?  What does that mean?  What, are we in the radio schoolyard punching people in the face?  We might have.  Maybe we used to have some bullying tactics we used.  Like Jocktober every year?  You are bullies.  It's okay.  Bullies.  Radio bullies.  We're radio bullshit.  That's what we are.  Please get it straight, schnit.  What an awful name to have to be saddled with. 
[01:42:30]  I would really rather have a career in show business if my name was Eldridge Cuntsniffer.  That would look better on a marquee.  Eldridge Cuntsniffer.  You spell it with a K and six Fs.  Cuntsniffer.  He's going with a little Book of Mormon thing right there.  Oh.  You didn't even realize, did you?  No, I did not.  What was the name of one of the characters?  It was Elder.  They were all Elder something.  Oh, the butt-fucking-naked guy.  What was his name?  Oh, yeah, yes.  General Butt-Fuck-Naked, yes. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, there's a character called General Butt-Fucking-Naked.  Butt-Fucking-Naked.  That's what those African generals do.  They take these weird, horrible curse words and make their names out of them.  That's hilarious.  You've got to see Book of Mormon.  We have Josh coming in, one of the leads.  He was un-fucking-believable.  Tremendous.  Josh Gad is going to be a massive star.  Todd Schnitt.  Why would Breitbart show it to those guys?  You know, those guys are radio bullies.  Opie and Anthony, they're...  What are we, Todd? 
[01:43:30]  Go ahead, tell them.  Tell them.  Go ahead, you can do it.  I don't dislike them, but they are...  It's a shock jock radio show, and they're...  First of all, it's not anymore, asshole.  Do we, every once in a while, do shocking things?  Yes.  You were a shock jock in the heyday of shock jocks when you were doing MJ and BJ.  So what the fuck are you talking about?  We've been doing some fun interviews with people, and if you think talking about your  life and bodily functions and, you know, sex is shocking, have you even turned on a computer 
[01:44:00]  in the past 10 fucking years?  There's nothing we can do.  We've been pretty...  That can shock people by sound, by audio.  We've been pretty clean for the last four years.  Yeah, I wouldn't, you know...  We've had some big hits in the last four years, but not for shocking things.  When Jesse Ventura walked off our show, it wasn't because we were being shock jocks. 
[01:44:30]  Because he was being a dick.  Yes, occasionally we do delve into the fact that Greta Van Susteren may have had pictures  of her dog and cats on her cell phone, and there was peanut butter involved in our conversation,  and our conversation also went far enough to speculate that perhaps one of the dogs licks  peanut butter deeply out of her bunghole.  But is that really shocking? 
[01:45:00]  What's the face and sound they make when they burrow their nose?  Just digging deep.  And then you hear the occasional...  The moaning.  Yeah, as the claws clumsily scrape open the fucking flabby-ass cheek.  I love that picture in my head.  Fucking rotten pink dog dick, some action finally. 
[01:45:30]  He's just sick of being jerked off by her fucking friends.  He can't help it, so he's...  He's licking, but he's got his back arched like the dogs arch it, and he's just humping  the air.  Yeah, or he's fucking her shoe.  Like her tennis shoe fell off when she came the first time, and he fucked her tennis shoe.  As he's just...  Dick.  Dig deep.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, yeah, so we're not shock jocks. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, let's get back to touch, Nick.  Jock radio show, and they're, you know, essentially the radio, you know, bullies.  That's what they do.  I'm not blaming them for that.  That's what they do for a living.  Wrong.  Well, this, I mean, I would expect them to...  I would expect...  If you go into the studio and show them, I would expect them to have some kind of apparatus  or some way to capture the photos.  That's what I would do if I were in that business.  You were.  I'm not blaming Opie and Anthony here.  I'm just saying that they're shock jocks.  We're not shock jocks.  They're the ones that got fired in New York. 
[01:46:30]  Remember, they had a couple having sex at St. Patrick's.  Never happened.  It was...  They're surprising.  Yeah, that's the duo.  They got fired from broadcast radio.  They were out of work for a while.  Then they were picked up by...  Then they went to XM or whatever it was.  So, you know, that's what they do.  They're radio shock jocks.  And they're bullies.  And I'm not blaming them for that.  That's the act they do.  That's the show they do.  Just being honest and describing... 
[01:47:00]  No, you're not being honest, Todd, because if Andrew Breitbart was on your show and he  was passing the phone around, you would try to figure out in your tiny little pea brain  of a fucking head there how to get involved with the story.  It's not as bad as I thought it was.  No, I know.  From what the listeners were saying, it was like...  Because he's going out of his way to go, look, I'm not trash.  But still, he would do the exact same thing if he had the chance.  Why can't you admit that, Todd?  That's the problem I have with this.  I think the problem is this Todd Schmidt just doesn't exactly know what he's supposed to be doing. 
[01:47:30]  No, that's the show they do.  Just being honest and describing what these guys...  So, you know, Breitbart, I think, is really to blame here.  All right, so this is breaking.  In just the last half hour, I've got more information that's just come in.  Oh.  And so I think it's important to deal with this.  The wiener's out.  The wiener is out of the zipper.  I get it.  I guess you're a morning zoo now.  We're shock jocks and you're a morning zoo.  That's a morning zoo line, Todd.  You're better than that. 
[01:48:00]  All right, Sue, could you please do a news search  and see if retired NASCAR driver Dick Trickle has any...  More morning zoo shit, by the way.  Comment.  Wow, Dick Trickle.  On this, could you...  Poor Dick Trickle.  All right.  Sue, now...  That was a bomb, Todd.  Did you watch, I guess, the shock jocks, Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  Who, listen, I don't know what Breitbart was thinking.  Well, first of all, good for Opie and Anthony,  because these guys have been, like, buried underground for, like, years now. 
[01:48:30]  And finally, they've struck some pay dirt here to get their name back on the news.  That's...  Finally.  What are you talking about?  We get hits here and there, man.  The Jesse Ventura thing was huge for us.  The Sharon Osbourne thing was huge for us.  Just last week, the Paris Hilton thing was huge for us.  Finally, though.  I mean, this is an over-the-top big one, but we've had some big things.  It's, uh...  I'm not even going to argue with the guy.  Two out of the three guys do national TV on a regular basis? 
[01:49:00]  I mean, what are you talking about?  Honestly, working for this company, it is very hard to get national press.  You know, when we were doing the virus comedy tour, we were getting national press on that.  But it was a lot easier in the old days when they just relegate you to some windowless shithole in the middle of the building and just don't give you the opportunity to do anything outside because, for some reason, they can never pay for anything.  Probably because they're paying their lawyers too much. 
[01:49:30]  Then, you know, he's got a point.  It would be nice to get out there, be able to do things, do some outrageous things every so often just to get the name out there.  But, you know, they stop us from doing shit like that.  So I'm not even going to argue with the guy on this one.  Yeah, good.  I'm glad we fucking hit something.  It was nice to be up, like, for most of the night looking at Twitter and texting you and shit like that.  It was like the old days. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think this isn't as bad as I believe me.  With a name like schnitt, I wanted to fucking beat the piss out of him.  But he's not really.  He's throwing the shock jock name around.  Big shit.  But this isn't nearly as bad as the listeners were like, he fucking trashed you.  This is nothing.  I'll say this.  Sirius XM certainly took our momentum away that we brought into this place.  Please.  We had an unbelievable momentum that was taken away as soon as we moved into this building. 
[01:50:30]  And it was from, and basically the guy that was in charge of keeping that momentum going and bringing it to the next level,  even said to our faces like, yeah, you guys were kind of buried over there at XM.  You know, not much going on.  He actually said that to our face at one of our first meetings.  Big studio, live audience.  Yeah, that sucked.  Comedy tours.  Oh, yeah.  Meeting listeners every single day.  There were some days we met a hundred listeners just on a regular Tuesday.  Yeah, that sucked.  Every day we met dozens of brand new people from around the country that were in New York. 
[01:51:00]  Ew.  They took all that away to be in this shitty, tiny little studio that was supposed to be temporary.  Because, you know why?  Because the vibe of the building.  Remember that one?  Right.  It's like, you guys are here by yourself at XM.  Yeah, you got a nice studio and it's bigger than anything.  But, like, the vibe of just there.  Like, there's action in the hallways.  And is it really?  Another fat fuck carrying coffee down the hallway?  Right.  Is that the vibe I'm supposed to be, you know, latching onto and getting inspired by? 
[01:51:30]  How about bleachers full of fucking fans?  Like we had every day.  And being able to perform in front of a live audience on a radio show.  That was inspiring.  Shaking hands every day, taking pictures every day.  Yeah, I was annoying.  I'm fucking around.  Do you need to be inspired?  That's great.  Yeah.  That's great.  I need some inspiration.  Don't look around you to feel good.  Look within you to feel better.  I hate your inspirations. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, because they sound like real ones.  They are real ones.  Oh, no, they are not.  There's going to be a whole book of Jimspirations.  It's drivel.  No, it's not.  An apple a day is read like a book.  Oh, read like a book.  Yeah, okay.  That makes no sense.  I hate your dumb inspirations.  We haven't even heard from the head asshole on this whole thing. 
[01:52:30]  You'd think that guy would pop his head in.  Oh, I'm glad.  I think he just doesn't like us.  I'm glad not.  I don't want to hear from anybody.  Likewise.  I don't want to hear from anybody.  No.  That elevator is looking really good.  It's nice.  Todd continues.  Some pay dirt here to get their name back on the news.  I mean, there hasn't been any activity on these guys.  I thought they were dead, actually.  I had no idea they were still around.  So good for them.  Are you doing Fox on a regular basis, Todd? 
[01:53:00]  What are you talking about?  You're lying.  You know you're lying.  You didn't know we were around.  He's lying.  You know what the fuck I'm thinking?  That's the shit I hate.  He's lying.  I've never heard his name at all.  Right.  Like, I couldn't even have said I thought he was dead because I never knew he existed.  Right.  I would have only thought he was dead if his name was Snake Plissken.  Look, Ant was just on TV.  Jimmy was on TV before this whole thing hit.  Yeah, we do a lot of that television. 
[01:53:30]  My latest street video is up to 20,000 views.  I mean, we're out there.  We're out there.  I love that.  He's just lying.  I hate liars.  He knows we're still in the public eye, just in a different way now.  But they're shock jocks.  They're morning radio bully shock jocks.  This is what they do.  What is Breitbart thinking?  What the hell is Breitbart thinking?  Even whipping that out, the photo.  His iPhone. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, boy.  Unbelievable.  Todd, you're right there.  What was Breitbart thinking?  Breitbart.  What was Breitbart thinking?  Is that E.T.?  He had a Breitbart.  You can see it.  His fingertip.  Imus just said this.  Oh.  Oh, that would have been great if it was ready to roll.  What?  The door doesn't want to close.  And it doesn't want to boot up. 
[01:54:30]  A bootah.  Is it not booting up?  Who made the disc?  Their fault.  I'm not going to throw anyone under the bus.  I would.  Why not?  How about you just bump them under the bus?  I love that bus.  Off the curb when the bus is coming.  I love that bus.  We might need another copy, or maybe I could do this.  Yeah, give it the old shirt wipe.  Let's try that.  See if that worked.  That probably did nothing.  Yeah, we might need another copy of this.  You trying the other deck?  I tried everything.  Oh, shit. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, man.  It's an upper decker.  Hey, Sam, why don't you get over there then?  What am I supposed to do?  You know, during the shit hour, Sam is sitting right where you are, Opie.  Maybe he knows how to work the equipment a little better.  Right.  Oh, boy, Sam.  You didn't know what the boss was doing, so you began surmising what he was doing incorrectly.  All right, Rush Limbaugh.  We'll go to Rush instead.  We got Imus hopefully in a little bit.  I got to figure out what's going on with that.  Rush had something to say?  Yes, he did.  Rush Limbaugh. 
[01:55:30]  The saga continues.  All right, it's out there.  The full-fledged photo of Anthony Weiner's member is out there.  Andrew Breitbart gave it to a couple of serious radio shock jocks who have, well, it's at Gawker.  The picture's at Gawker.com.  Check, check.  No longer is Anthony Weiner's member covered by underwear. 
[01:56:00]  It's...  I'm telling you, it's out there.  Is that it?  That's it.  All right.  He doesn't even sound like Rush anymore.  No.  Weird.  He really does.  His fucking ears are made of silly putty.  Yeah.  Had to go in there and rebuild that fucking rotting drum.  Yeah.  What the fuck, man?  Yeah.  His cadence is different and everything. 
[01:56:30]  Weird.  And Sean Hannity.  Now, Breitbart was on with Opie and Anthony earlier today on their program, and...  He'll get it right.  This is actually a pretty funny story.  So, and I know Opie and Anthony.  Anthony comes on our great American panel, and Opie just won't come on the show with me.  I don't know what the problem is.  He's more liberal than...  Anthony's really, I mean, on political issues, is pretty solidly conservative.  So, anyway, so, you know, but these guys are horsing around all the time and having a good time on their program. 
[01:57:00]  So, they said, Breitbart, and they said, all right, well, you know, we don't believe you have a picture of a naked Anthony Wiener.  So, he says, I do so.  And he pulled it up on his phone, and he showed it to them.  So, Anthony takes it, apparently shows it to Opie, and Opie takes a picture with his phone, and then he tweeted it out, if he can believe that.  So, now that picture's out there.  Once again, we all tweeted it.  Everybody had some fun with that one.  Yeah.  And then Sean continues. 
[01:57:30]  You know, I have to watch my email carefully today, because...  Anyway, Andrew Breitbart was on with our old friends Opie and Anthony on their radio program this morning.  And so, anyways, they said to Breitbart, you don't really have the other picture, et cetera, et cetera.  So, anyway, so Breitbart says, I do so, I'll show it to you.  And so, then Opie takes a picture of the, of Andrew Breitbart handing him...  No, it was us. 
[01:58:00]  This is an us thing.  Eh, detail.  It's an important detail.  A picture got taken.  He's trying to break it down.  But you were just as excited as me.  Oh, yeah.  And you may have tweeted it before me, sir.  A picture got out there?  You may have before me.  That's what I'm going to say in court.  I was trying to.  I was trying to get it out there quickly.  I saw the look in your eye.  We looked at each other like, fuck you, man.  I think you got it first, but then I got the bigger version.  And then I got a version of that. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Breitbart handing him the picture of, that Breitbart said wasn't going to release.  And they threw it up on Twitter.  So now everybody's out there, and everyone's sending pictures all over the place of Wiener's Wiener.  Well, how do you want me to say it?  There's no other way I can say it on radio here.  And so I'm watching my email because people are sending it.  It's all over the place now.  And apparently Breitbart's not happy about it because he had said that he wasn't going to release it. 
[01:59:00]  But he didn't release it.  And I think Opie did, not Anthony.  And it's kind of funny if you ask me.  What do you expect?  These things aren't going to get out there?  Is he throwing me under the bus to save you because you're a Fox guy now?  He's not throwing you under the bus at all.  I'm a Fox shill.  Oh, yes, he's credited to you.  It's just a joke.  I'm a Fox shill, as they say.  It's just a joke.  I know Sean means well.  On his TV show, Hannity just showed a picture of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, boy. 
[01:59:30]  What?  Because we were also laughing in the office at some of the coverage because I think on CNN they said the Opie and Anthony show,  and then they went to B-roll, and it was Ant talking to Bill Burr.  What the fuck?  They just can't figure it out.  They just pull something out of their stock.  Because they do their jobs like we do.  Yeah, just grab something.  Just grab it quickly.  And then on Hannity, for whatever reason, even though he said Opie and Anthony,  the still picture came up, and it was just the Opie part of the 8x10, 
[02:00:00]  so only Opie was shown.  It was just a picture of you the whole time.  And then there's another version where Opie and Anthony are represented by Jim Norton and Vincent D'Onofrio.  And Vincent D'Onofrio.  And more D'Onofrio than Jimmy.  Right.  He didn't want to be part of that.  Like at one point, they just have D'Onofrio on the camera talking.  On CNN, when they were playing the clip, they were subtitling it with the still images,  and they said it was Vincent D'Onofrio saying something, and they just credited it as host. 
[02:00:30]  Host.  Because they didn't know it was D'Onofrio.  They had no clue that that's Vincent D'Onofrio?  No.  Oh, God.  And then Colbert used the XM logo from five years ago?  Yes.  Not the serious ass.  That's the shit I love.  It really is great.  They just pull out of their ass real fast.  What is this?  This is the woman you like from CNN.  Julia.  Yeah.  What's her name again?  I don't remember.  She was the one that got us...  Did we get suspended or fired for the voyeur bus? 
[02:01:00]  I got arrested.  You guys had nothing happen.  Yeah, that's true.  I spent a night in jail.  You guys got a fucking kiss and a coffee.  Oh, nothing happened, Jimmy?  Did it?  I had to wait in the office at N.E.W. until about midnight.  Oh, that's true.  You had to spend a night in jail, but I waited at my desk for some kind of news until midnight that night.  Is this the woman who talks like fucking a scalding coffee has just been poured on her tongue?  That's correct.  She's a twat, and the reason she's a twat, but I pretty much don't like many of these people. 
[02:01:30]  When we were doing the voyeur bus thing, she hopped on the old bus.  She did.  With the understanding that, wow, this is just all fun for everybody.  Fun games.  Look at all the people looking.  This is great.  And we obviously were a lot dumber back then because we bought into like, oh, cool, this could be on CNN as a fun fluff piece.  And then she got off the bus in front of where the mayor lives or City Hall. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, I think it was Gracie Mansion down there, right?  Or was it City Hall?  I think it might have been City Hall.  City Hall, yeah.  Because it was afternoon driving.  I think Giuliani was still working.  She jumped out with what she had filmed already and ran to Mayor Giuliani to go, do you see what's going on in your city tonight?  What do you think about this?  Stupid.  Yeah.  He had a comment and called us stupid.  A presidential candidate called us stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Let's hear how she did this fucking thing.  Just when you think things can't get any worse for Anthony Weiner, this happened. 
[02:02:30]  A picture of Weiner's Weiner got out there.  A naked picture that we can't show you, though the Internet will.  A picture we can't confirm is Weiner.  A photo conservative website owner Andrew Breitbart said he had, but wouldn't release to spare Weiner's family.  I'm trying to do the decent thing here and not release the photo.  But when Breitbart went on the Opie and Anthony shock jock radio show, he had the photo on his phone. 
[02:03:00]  We begged, we pleaded, we prodded.  And Breitbart finally agreed to pass it around.  It was a photo Breitbart says he obtained from one of the women to whom Weiner sent intimate photos.  To a gal down in Texas.  He's in very good shape.  All I can say is from seeing that picture, I want that.  And now there's a picture.  The Vincent D'Onofrio angle is getting funnier.  It's hysterical.  And your neck still looks long, by the way, in that photo. 
[02:03:30]  Does it?  Well, I was on the floor and I had to look up.  That's the Opie and Anthony show.  There's five of us now.  Yeah, Eric popped a little publicity photo after yesterday's show.  And it's Jimmy, Vincent D'Onofrio, Andrew Breitbart, Anthony, and then me sort of on the floor looking up because I didn't know where to stand.  Poor Vincent D'Onofrio.  He's on the news for 24 straight hours for no reason.  I love the guy.  Look at the picture.  He's blinking.  His eyes are shot.  He just didn't want this.  He's like, why did I have to be there on that fucking day? 
[02:04:00]  I can't believe it.  He wanted to promote one order.  There's just video of me and him all over the news.  I bet you the first time he's flipping through.  Someone probably says, you're on TV.  He's like, what?  What is this?  They did what?  I wish we had a relationship with him.  We met him for the first time yesterday.  I would love to call him.  I'm the last time, by the way.  Yes, I'm certain.  He's one of those guys, probably.  But I would love to talk to him today and go, what?  In this picture, it says his name right there in case there's any confusion. 
[02:04:30]  In big print, it says Vincent D'Onofrio.  It's like, why?  We should try to get him on the phone and just see if he understands it.  If Roland could do that, that'd be great.  I don't know.  That's going to be a tough one.  But I'll back it up slightly.  We were talking about fact-checking.  You know this is good because the news credited CokeLogic.  From right there.  It's from YouTube slash CokeLogic.  Oh, there you go.  CokeLogic gets his own little...  My phone is so famous.  Yeah, you got the famous phone.  Look at my phone.  Look, it's right here.  This phone, I could sell this phone and be like, this is the phone. 
[02:05:00]  Absolutely.  And the picture's still on it, by the way.  He's got a regular phone and a famous guy's phone.  And a famous guy's phone and a regular phone.  Look, see?  Look, watch.  Look, it looks just like that.  Wow, that's the picture.  That's the picture.  There's my hand.  There's my hand.  We're not tweeting it anymore.  There's my hand and everything.  See?  That guy has big balls.  By the way, a lot of picture services yanked my picture. 
[02:05:30]  So I just kept going to different ones all over the fucking place.  Yeah, there's Ant's phone on CNN.  His fingers.  And of course, my retarded thumb getting in the way of the picture I was taking, if you're wondering.  There's my stupid fucking sperm out of my birth defect.  Thank God it's tiny.  It didn't take up too much room.  Really?  Thank God you didn't have human thumbs who fucking blocked the whole thing.  Look how giant my thumb is.  It's always getting in the way.  That's why I can't bowl.  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  Old tootsie thumbs.  Yeah, like I never noticed that your fucking finger is in the middle of the...  No, it's my stupid thumb.  This little thumb goes to market.  Can you back it up?  So this is Julie...  Julie Moose?  I don't know.  I don't know her name.  Fucking hag that shouldn't be on the show.  Exactly.  Holla.  Fucking tongue biter.  It was a photo Breitbart says he obtained from one of the women to whom Wiener sent intimate photos.  To a gal down in Texas.  That's a good angle, though.  Smart guy, but I think... 
[02:06:30]  He's in very good shape.  All I can say is from seeing that picture, I want that guy as mayor.  That's not real.  Well, everyone was chortling over the photo.  Can you rewind a little bit so I can hear that fucking bitch say chortling again?  What's wrong with her voice?  I don't know.  Chortling.  What's getting in the way with her?  The tongue or maybe fake teeth?  I'll bet you she bites...  Oh, God.  I hope it's fake teeth.  I hope she had regular teeth, but they rotted out and she sneezed and they all fell into  a pile of horseshit and no dentist would grab them.  Boo. 
[02:07:00]  I love fifth Mike, Vincent D'Onofrio.  I love how we just drag innocent people into our bullshit.  There's no reason the guy that played Private Pile, Vincent D'Onofrio,  should be in this in any way, shape, or form.  I am in a world...  That's that guy.  Right.  That's the guy.  The Private's weapon's name is Charlene, sir!  Has to deal with this.  Ow! 
[02:07:30]  Ow!  I know we give him a radio blanket party.  Yes!  Unbelievable.  Hitting with blackberries.  To a gal down in Texas.  Unbelievable.  It's a good angle, though.  He's a smart guy, but I think...  He's in very good shape.  All I can say is, from seeing that picture, I want that guy as mayor.  And while everyone was chortling over the photo...  One of the video cameras that was on during the show today captured what was on Andrew  Breitbart's phone as it was making its way around the room.  Breitbart says he didn't know an image was taken, and he says, 
[02:08:00]  I regret that this occurred.  Next thing you know...  It was a race to see who could tweak the picture the fastest.  Opie won that race with this tweet, and the photo went viral.  Huh.  I think Andrew Breitbart's not too happy with us right now.  If he thinks Andrew Breitbart's not happy, imagine what Anthony Weiner must be thinking  outside the bun.  Genie Moe, CNN.  What?  Anthony Weiner in a bun.  Oh. 
[02:08:30]  Get it?  Stick a fork in him.  He's done, it says.  By the way, one of our email accounts that I certainly don't check at all, there's a bunch  of people who are really mad because they're saying, how could you do that with his wife  being pregnant?  First of all, we had no idea his wife was pregnant.  All this went down way before that news hit.  Yes.  It gives a shit.  And also, this is the thing that pumped the jizz into her.  Don't you want to see it?  Yeah.  Don't you want to see the baby maker?  He's responsible for all of this.  It's his cock in the photo.  His potent, delicious cock that pumped all that fucking hard-working sperm into her. 
[02:09:00]  His potent cock in those shorts.  Jesus Christ.  We didn't get her pregnant.  I wish I did.  She's relatively attractive.  It was just his delicious, functional cock.  Why do you have to call it delicious?  Because it looks...  I'm not gay or anything, but it just looks like it's a fresh mouthful.  You're going to be hearing this a lot in the next month or so, Ant.  I've got to see Book of Mormon. 
[02:09:30]  Imus.  A word about Opie and Ant, of course, as you know, I'd love them to death.  But, I mean, come on.  What do you think they're going to do?  They did what they should have done.  I mean, if you're Breitbart, you moron, you walk in the studio and pass your cell,  oh, come on.  With these two hooligans who we love, by the way?  I mean, what do you think?  What do you expect?  Good for Opie and Ant, of Norton, all of them.  Come on here.  I love Imus.  Let's leave our show and go do Imus' show. 
[02:10:00]  We'd love to right now.  This place doesn't give a shit about us.  Imus certainly does.  I think he's in...  Is he in...  I think he's in New Mexico, wherever the hell he is.  Do you know where I might be going there?  Really?  To the Imus Ranch?  Yeah, there's...  A thing kind of happened.  I said I would, like...  A thing?  You want to take a pony ride?  I want to take a pony ride.  A little pony ride?  I said I would go down there and support the ranch, and now I think it might...  I think it's a thing.  I go down there?  I think now I have to go and do some time on Imus' ranch.  Larry King's on Imus right now. 
[02:10:30]  Larry King!  Yeah.  He looks great.  He's done more than 50,000 interviews.  Oh, my God.  Three of them relevant.  Nice suspense.  Jimmy, I wish you were here for the Larry King.  So do I.  That was a moment.  That was a good one.  I wish I was, too.  We interviewed the guy that has done 50,000 interviews.  That was so surreal.  And I asked where the groceries were.  What's the problem?  You asked where the groceries were?  That's the problem?  A woman had just been raped, you see? 
[02:11:00]  You see?  Good question.  Yeah.  All right.  I got a leak really badly.  Leak then, baby.  You did yesterday.  It leaked.  It leaked.  I think we're kind of done with this for now, unless something hits.  I want to hear the Fez audio, too.  Oh, yeah.  We want to do some material, other material today.  I want to hear the Fez audio.  That's just a little bit of the media attention, by the way.  We didn't even focus on all the local news reports or any of that shit.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Great for our show.  Wow.  That was good. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Josh will be in shortly.  All right.  So we'll break.  We'll try to do a little Fez versus Roland shit.  And he's here?  What?  One moment?  What?  What?  Show it?  Oh, yeah.  He's here early.  What is Kenny doing?  I don't know.  What's he doing?  Josh is here.  Got some soup.  Josh is here early.  Okay.  He's here already?  Yeah.  Let's take a quick break, and then we'll grab him.  Yeah.  We'll break, and we'll talk to Josh next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM. 
[02:12:00]  The virus.  But it's a good boy's phone, and it's a naughty boy's phone.  I'm not here by his phone, and it's a good boy's phone.  It's a good boy's phone, and it's a naughty boy's phone.  I'm not here by his phone, and it's a good boy's phone.  But it's a good boy's phone, and it's a naughty boy's phone. 
[02:12:30]  A good boy's phone, that is a good boy's phone 
[02:13:00]  What a day, what a day, what a day  And we're going to change gears here for a moment  Yes  The Book of Mormon is on Broadway, it's a musical  And Jimmy has seen it twice, I went last night with Jimmy  Yes  And wow man, this thing is just absolutely amazing 
[02:13:30]  I wrote phenomenal in a tweet after I saw it last night  I think that's a good  Phenomenal, in quotation marks  Yeah, it was phenomenal  Greg Opie Hughes underneath it  And I don't like musicals, I fucking hate them, Josh  Who just entered the studio with one of the stars  If not the star of the Book of Mormon  Oh well thank you, I don't know about that  I'm not a big musical guy, but I gotta tell you  I think this will sell it a little bit  It's two, I think it's two hours and fifteen minutes  And I didn't look down at my playbill once 
[02:14:00]  I've been, I've been dragged to Broadway over the years  And all of a sudden you start looking at the playbill going  How many more fucking songs do I have to sit through?  I didn't do that once  Is it as good as Cats was?  You know what, it is, it's up there with, I think, Cats  And also Starlight Express  Starlight Express  With the roller skating trains  Do you remember that?  Yes, I do  Starlight Express  Yes  My mom used to make me listen to like  The best of Andrew Lloyd Webber as a kid  Wow  And it, yeah  Well it paid off 
[02:14:30]  Yeah  Did it?  I don't know, you're on Broadway  And it hit musical  I think it might have paid off  You're right  I don't know  It's a fucking  It's crazy  I was like, I've heard so much about it  And I'm like, there's no  And it was better than I thought it would be  And the first one I went to  Oh, this was great  Uh oh  Because Josh was in  He was sick the first day I went  It was a Wednesday afternoon  And I didn't know who played who  And they say the part  For this performance 
[02:15:00]  The part of Elder Cunningham  Elder Cunningham will be played by  And they named your, I guess, understudy  And I was sitting next to a 60-year-old woman  And she went, oh, that  Blows  This  Blows  Oh, well, I apologize  She was so  Fuck her  To you, Madeline, if you're listening  It was a great  It was really great  And I didn't know who it was  Until a couple minutes in  I'm like, oh, okay  Yeah  And then I went back and saw it with you yesterday 
[02:15:30]  Yeah  And I definitely  And he was very good  But you're obviously  It's your role  It's his  Absolutely  Well, you know, yeah  It's been rough  Because I've been dealing with  A raging sinus infection  And it always sucks to miss any shows  But you couldn't tell  Well, thank you  If you're still going through that  You can't even tell  I'm actually three octaves higher usually  Really?  Yeah  I sound like Michael Jackson on a good day  So, yeah  No, I'm a little higher  But it's, you know what?  It has been just the thrill ride of a lifetime  And the thing about it is  Is we keep hearing that over and over 
[02:16:00]  People who don't like musicals coming and saying  Oh, my God  I freaking love this thing  And it's because Trey, Matt, and Bobby Lopez  Who also did Avenue Q  They just understand, like, good storytelling  Yeah  They understand good storytelling  They clearly understand comedy  Because they've mastered it  A little question there  Yes  So, it's just, like, the perfect  It's resonated with the zeitgeist right now  It's just, like, the perfect time  Perfect place  Yeah  Perfect story  That's why I sold it that way 
[02:16:30]  Because I wouldn't go see a musical in general  But this thing is  It's pretty cool  Getting accolades from the critics, too  Which is amazing  The public and the critics liking something is unheard of  Pretty rare, right?  Yeah  And the buzz on this thing is unbelievable  Jimmy and I went for sushi afterwards  And Jimmy got up to take a phone call  Because we got a little thing happening today  And the people next to us saw the playbill  And went, is it as good as they're saying?  And I'm like, it's even better than what they're saying  This thing is unbelievable 
[02:17:00]  And then you got back  And then the couple to the other side of us  Who thought we were a couple, by the way  They thought we were a couple who had gone out to the theater  And seen a musical together  Well, we probably shouldn't have walked in holding hands, Jimmy  What are you going to do?  It's a remarkable thing  I'll walk into Serafina, the restaurant next door sometimes  To get a quick drink  Oh, you're hobnobbing  Well, I am  And they pay me to give them  A little plug  Yeah, a little plug  But I'll walk in sometimes with Cass  And people will literally stop what they're doing 
[02:17:30]  And start applauding  Wow  It's crazy  I get that when I leave a place  I think it's refreshing  And maybe that's why they're applauding  To hear really edgy material  And certainly you guys are not holding back  There's a baby fucking joke in this thing  Yes, there is  And it works  That's what's amazing  There's no one going  In shock or horror  Well, you know what's so crazy about that  Is  I can't tell you how many people come up to me  And say  It's really not as offensive  As I thought it was going to be 
[02:18:00]  And that's just it  And I look at them  And I go  There's baby fucking humor  I mean, what's really remarkable  Is that they've weaved together  Such a good story  And such a heartfelt story  That people don't even realize  How offensive it is  Yeah, yeah  At times  There's a couple of moments  Where you get like  It's very informative  And not boring at all  But they're telling you exactly  How this moment started  They walk you through the process  So when they do callbacks to it 
[02:18:30]  At the end  You know exactly what they're doing  And the woman  I think the four  That's the four  Josh is I think  You would be considered the lead  I would consider you the star of the show  That's only because I'm on right now  No, no  I really would  And it's also  Are you the only one nominated or no?  No  Is that  Nikki M. James  Is that her name?  Nikki  I love her  Isn't she remarkable?  Phenomenal  She's the black girl  Who was  Really sexy  She's really it  Yeah  Yeah, she's really cute  I was hoping when you baptized her 
[02:19:00]  That we'd be able to see  Something through that see-through dress there  But unfortunately not  Yeah, I'm sorry about that  Sometimes I think about  Misplacing her bra before the scene  So that the audience can get a little more  Than they bargained for  But no, it really is  I mean, she's incredible  Andrew Rannells  Who plays my co-star  He's just unbelievable  He's great  Oh, he played Brother Price, right?  Yeah, he is  Tremendous  He is exactly what you would imagine  A perfect Mormon specimen would be  And then Rory O'Malley  Who plays the gay  Elder McGregor  Dude 
[02:19:30]  Now, think about Rory  Turn it off  Yeah, he's brilliant  The thing about Rory is  He and I were roommates in college  We literally have grown up together  And now we're both Tony nominated  He made me fucking laugh  Oh, he's brilliant  This is brilliant  That one  We did that all night  And we laughed  That I  Turn it off  Turn it off  That fucking  Turn it off  And the side of his mouth  Is turning off  Really fucking funny  Son of a bitch  He's funny, man  He's amazing  We'll let more people see this thing  And then we'll have to talk about that scene  You'll just say  You'll know what that is  When you see it 
[02:20:00]  It's just a very subtle thing  The guy does  He probably was not directed to do it  It's probably just a funny thing  That a funny guy does  Just to pump it up a little bit  And yeah  He just saw that as being  A very funny thing to do  And Michael  Where do I know Michael Potts from?  Michael is a genius too  Michael has done  Which guy was he?  He's on The Wire  He plays the father  Who was he on The Wire?  You know what?  He was on The Wire  His name is very familiar  I knew the name was familiar  He's done a bunch of stuff 
[02:20:30]  I thought he looked familiar too  If I find out he was on The Wire  Because we're fucking  Wire freaks  You know what?  I keep hearing that it's the greatest show  Of all time  It is  And I'm like  I gotta sit down  Just get the box set  And just run through it  I'm sure you guys are bored  In between shows  Yeah  Battlestar Galactica  You done that yet?  Oh the box set?  No  Really?  Obviously new one  It's incredible  Not the old one  No the new one  You know what?  Lorne Green  Josh I want to back up a little bit 
[02:21:00]  Because it's obvious  I said this before you got here  You're going to be a huge fucking star  Oh well thank you  You're on your way now  Where did you come from?  Like give us some basics here  Yeah well I grew up in South Florida  And I decided at a pretty young age  That I wanted to be fat and funny  I succeeded at the fat part  First  And then the funny part  Came a little after  And I decided that I wanted to  Go to college  To pursue drama and acting  And I went to Carnegie Mellon  Where I met Rory 
[02:21:30]  And yeah  And out of college  It was kind of like  Oh my god  I'm going to go  Take over the world  I wanted to do SNL  Desperately  Like that was my dream  And they didn't want me to do it  Did you audition?  You know  I kept sending in tapes  Oh they're a loss man  Oh well I appreciate that  Honestly you could just tell  By the way  Brother Malzone  Oh is that Michael Potts?  Mother  Oh my god  Of course it is  Is that right?  Mother  Yes  Fucker  Yeah that guy right? 
[02:22:00]  Of course it is  The brother  The friggin  Oh god  Damn it that's him  Is that a good role?  Yes  That's a great  I gotta go watch it  A great role  God  Did he come out after the show?  I have to go again and meet him  Come  I want you to come tonight  I'm going to introduce you  Fuck  He didn't have the glasses on  Yeah  And he wasn't shooting somebody  Oh  And you know what the coolest part  About Michael is  Is he's a teacher  He's like a drama teacher by day  Really?  Yeah  You could tell  That's a great role  That guy had  I knew the name was familiar 
[02:22:30]  I'm glad I didn't look it up  You looked familiar  Because I would have been obsessed  Watching it last night  You would have  It would have ruined your experience  Watching the show again  It would have wrecked my night  All you would have done  Was trying  You would have been scheming  How to get a photo  Now we know  So SNL  So yeah  It's SNL  But it allows me to say this now  Chevy Chase was at the theater  Last night  I tweeted a picture  Because he was sitting  Right across the aisle from me  Hello  And I said  Off air  That this guy  Chevy Chase 
[02:23:00]  Who comes across  As a bit of a dick  In general  Although he's turned it around  A little bit  With community  People are starting  To kind of like him again  Yeah  But he is a dick  It's a known fact  That in general  He's a dick  Unfortunately  He was very  I met him  He was amazingly  He was cool  To us  He was cool to us  You know why  Because he loved  He loved you  He was loving your shit  And he loved  The Book of Mormon  In general  He was the one  That stood up immediately  With his hands in the air  Just giving a massive  Standing ovation  He really 
[02:23:30]  You know  It's been a crazy  Crazy  Star sighting  Place  Who have you seen  That's pretty cool  Leonardo DiCaprio  There was one night  That literally  This was the guest list  Leonardo DiCaprio  Tobey Maguire  Kate Hudson  Gerard Butler  Michelle Williams  It was like  Frank Langella  Everywhere you looked  There was another star  Lorne Michaels  Steve Martin  Francis Ford Coppola  George Lucas  Everybody  Are you trying to say 
[02:24:00]  Opie  Jim Norton  And Chevy Chase  Doesn't add up  You know  It does  It does  I just  Wait now  Now did you know  Ahead of time  Or you're on that stage  And now you're looking around  Going wow  There's Leonardo  There was  At first I didn't want to know  And then there was one night  Where I saw  Lorne Michaels  And Steve Martin  And I almost shit myself  From the stage  Yeah  And I was like  I can't do this anymore  I need to know  I need to be prepared  So that it doesn't  Just completely throw me off  Oh freak you out 
[02:24:30]  I mean it's  It's such an intimate theater  So you knew Chevy  Was going to be there last night  Actually I didn't know that  I didn't know that  But I didn't see him  Until the end  So it was fine  And then you had one of the  Gene Wilder came last week  Wow  And Jack Nicholson  Really  Pretty fucking cool  Together  No they weren't  Are they a couple  I don't think  Is that what you're saying here  They're a couple  It is the show to see  In New York  And for celebrities  Yeah I'm sure  It's just like  If I want to see a show  That's the one I'm going to  Yeah and it's tough  It's tough to get them tickets  Yes 
[02:25:00]  So going back  You're out of college  You want to conquer the world  You wanted SNL  They didn't really pay attention to you  Yeah so I got a lot of rejection  For a long time  And about three years out  I wasn't really doing anything  And I actually called my mom one day  And I said  You know what  I'm thinking about giving up acting  And I'm going to go to law school  I had met my wife-to-be  And I wanted to just kind of  Have a family  And I was just tired of it  And so she started crying  I thought she was going to be  Like this happy Jewish mother  Oh my god  Finally you've come to your senses 
[02:25:30]  And she convinced me to stick with it  And a week later  I got my big break  In a Broadway show called Spelling Bee  And then ever since  I've been fortunate enough to work  And how did Matt and Trey  You know come your way?  I got a phone call  Three and a half years ago  From Bobby Lopez  And he said  You know  We're working  I'm working on this show  With the creators of South Park  We're not sure  Wow  What we're going to be doing  If it's going to be a movie  Or a stage musical 
[02:26:00]  But we want to do a reading of it  There's one act right now  And we think you'd be great  For this role of Elder Cunningham  I don't know if you can sing  So I  He asked for a demo  And we sent him one  And he listened to it  And he's like  Dude you've got a great voice  Hired me  It turns out that he was listening  To somebody else's voice  But I got the role anyway  And yeah  So that was the very first reading  That we did  Wow  Three and a half years ago  That's three and a half years ago  It's encouraging that it took that long  It's nice to see a great project  Took a  Fucking Brother Muzon 
[02:26:30]  I can't believe that's him  See I knew he would  Move on from that  It's just gonna freak him out  Now the whole time  He's the hard one to me  Cause I never knew  What he did after that show  What did he do  Like who was Brother Muzon  Brother Muzon was  An assassin  Yeah  A fucking really bad guy  You know what  This fucks my head though  Because tonight  Like all I'm going to think about  On stage every time he comes on  Is  Oh he's Brother Muzon  He doesn't tell you this stuff  When you guys are just  No  What do you think  We like exchange  Hey dude  I was in 21  What have you done  By the way  I did  Yeah  But he was 
[02:27:00]  You would just assume  It would come around  Such a great character  Really  Mild  He's a brilliant actor  Mild mannered  As all hell  But just  A bad guy  And have a bad smile  While he sings  Hasadig  Yeah  He's tremendous in this too  Yeah  Wow I'm glad I know  Who he is now  I just figured out  How I know you Josh  21  Yeah  Well I just said it  Yeah  No I know  But  I mean there's not  That much of an epiphany  If I said it  That's true  Honestly  I did not hear you say that  Oh alright  To be honest with you 
[02:27:30]  I'm a little tired today  But I remember you from 21  Yeah  I like that fucking movie  It's a good one isn't it  Yeah  And you know  Ben Mesrick  Who also wrote  Social Network  Yeah  Just  Such a brilliant  Book writer  And that whole story  About the kids  Counting cards at MIT  Is fascinating  Everything he writes  Becomes a fucking  Money making movie  Money making hit  It's kind of crazy  He's got another one  Coming out soon  Yeah he does  And it's going to be  Another huge hit  Social Network though  Loved it  Great movie

[02:28:30]  We've done some  Fucked up shit  Yeah  We used to talk  To those guys  When they were  Kind of  Just starting out  Now they won't  Give you the time of day  When South Park  When South Park  Actually needed  Plugs every week  We started playing  We'll make it about  Ourselves for a second  But when we were  Doing radio in Boston  We got a hold of  Some of the very early  South Park episodes  And the Jesus episode  Jesus  Jesus Santa Claus  And me and Ant  Were like  This is fucking  So we just started  Playing little clips  From the show  And people were like  What is  I remember to this day 
[02:29:00]  What is that  What are you guys  Playing that voice  It was Cartman  But no one knew  Who Cartman was yet  And then Matt and Trey  Got on board  Because they were  Trying to sell this  Thing to Comedy Central  And yeah  We did a lot of  Radio with those guys  And then  They kind of lost  Our number there  Josh  It happens  You know what  I'm going to play  Them this interview  And I'm going to  Make them regret it  Yeah  They kind of lost  Our number  Unfortunately  We're still  Huge fans  Well they'll be back  In town for the Tonys  Oh yeah  I'm sure we'll have  A buzz  Yeah  I'm sure that'll happen  Oh come on  14 nominations  By the way

[02:30:00]  Of the show  Yeah  Absolutely  She's got  She grounds it  In reality  You get a little  Teary eyed  Watching her  Sing of a couple  Of her songs  Because she gets  Very depressed  Do you get  Teary eyed at all  With my stuff  I'm trying to think  That's no  The touching  There was one  Touching moment  I won't give  Anything away  It's harder for me  With men  Attractive women  Much easier  To get a little  Teary eyed  But  My tits are almost  As big as hers  They really are  Lovely  But when you get  You know  When you  Let's just say  You and the other 
[02:30:30]  Lead are having  A little  When you and  Brother Price  Are having  Elder Price  Are having a  Little thing  And make sure  He's used the  Word stuck with  Let's just say that  Because I don't  Want to give  Anything away  You got a little  Choked up  A little bit  Yeah  Because you look  Like a  Fucking  A bit of an  Unhappy sad boy  Yeah  Well that's what  I was playing  I wanted to  Make you cry  I'm not an easy  I'm an easy  Cry  I'm a fucking  Pussy  I bawled through  I bet my  Fucking understudy  Made you cry  Didn't he  No  Not at all  I laughed  I wasn't even  Supposed to  I laughed  While he sang  We were talking 
[02:31:00]  About the understudy  And how  What a weird  Place to be  He just sits around  Waiting  Hoping that you  Get sick  So you obviously  Don't take any  Food or drink  Is that the rule  Of thumb  Like you never  Send the understudy  Out for a sandwich  You know  Yeah  It's  No he's  My understudy  Is actually a cool  Guy  But it is  You always are like  No I don't want  That brownie  Thank you  I'm on a diet  I'm on a diet  Of not taking  Anything from  Anybody right now  Is he backstage  Every night  Just sitting there  Going  I guess I'll just  Check my twitter  Again  No you know 
[02:31:30]  I mean he's  Actually been  Incredible  Because I think  That it's been  A little bit  Of like a  Shock to be  Thrown on so  Quickly  Because you know  Nobody expected  Expects to be  Out  But he's  He's done an  Amazing job  And you guys  Don't really  Practice anymore  Right so he's  Gotta  No they do  Every week the  Understudies actually  Have rehearsal  With what  Other understudies  With other understudies  And like you know  People who are in the show  Standbys and understudies  Also cover other roles 
[02:32:00]  Right  And so you know  They'll just kind of  Work through the show  Every week  Playing different roles  It's amazing the coordination  And the set changes  Everything  It's flawless man  It really is  And I watched it twice  And it was the same  Both times  There was no fuck ups  No missed lines  It's tremendous  There was a magical moment  I actually leaned over  To my wife  And went  How did they do that  When the lights went off  And then you guys  Had the vest on  We get that question  Every day 
[02:32:30]  How did they do that  The lights weren't off  Long enough  I think back pocket  That's just my  You know  That's just my guess  Was it back pocket  No  Give us a little  Back pocket  I will say no  It's not  What  It's also  Wait wait wait wait  You gotta tell me  Was it on their person  At all  I'm not gonna tell you  It's theater magic  But I'll tell you  Off the record  Yeah  I'll tell you  Off the record  Cover your mics  Talk to Andrew Breitbart  He'll tell you  What the off the record  Fucking in confidence 
[02:33:00]  And all that shit means  You know  I will also say  That a lot of that  Is Casey Negelot  The director  He's just a genius  And he gets  The comedy  So well  And so  You know  It's like  That was his idea  And it's so brilliant  Who puts it to music  Like how does it work  Like because all the songs  Are original  And it's like  Okay I can see the story  Like you write a story  Or you write dialogue  But when you get into  Very very funny songs  Yeah  I mean truly original 
[02:33:30]  Funny songs  And funny interactions  And then sometimes  Two songs cut into each other  It's really  Who does that  Like who thinks now  You know what  Do this with an African beat  Do this kind of like  So yeah  That's actually  A really good question  And I'm not going to answer it  I don't blame you  No  It's  Stephen Arimus  Who is  Kind of the  Orchestrator  And the musical arranger  Is the guy who  Puts all of the pieces  Together  And he's brilliant  He worked on Wicked  He worked on  He worked on Avenue Q 
[02:34:00]  Basically he's worked on  Everything that's been  Nominated for a Tony  And  And  And Larry  Who also did the  Arrangement with him  And the two of them  Just kind of come up with  The scope of it  With Bobby Lopez  And Trey  And Matt  And that's how it goes  Do you think  Now when you're  Nomics  Again I've never watched  The Tonys  I literally  I've gone to a few plays  This year  I saw Colin's play  I saw  How was that  It was brilliant  It was great  And did Seinfeld direct it  Yes  Produced it I guess  Produced and directed it  That was Colin's idea  Wrote the whole thing 
[02:34:30]  He's brilliant  And then Seinfeld  Got involved with it  Yeah  And Chris' play was great  It's on HBO  I was supposed to go see  Motherfucker last week  And I was sick  It's great  I heard it  He's amazing  He's great  And Bobby Convale  I can't wait to see that  And you know what  The talk of the town right now  Two plays  Normal Heart  And Jerusalem  And apparently  Mark Rylance  In Jerusalem  Is just extraordinary  What's it about  I don't know  Jerusalem  Oh  Jerusalem  I don't know  I haven't seen it  And the other one  I never go to plays 
[02:35:00]  I just went  Because I had a couple  And I saw Robin Williams play too  Which was great  Oh I saw that  Robin has been  So freaking supportive  He is  He came backstage  And he's like  Can I send you a bike  I was like  Yeah  I'll take a bike  From Robin Williams  Why do I want to send you a bike  He's a big bike enthusiast  I've seen him in the park  Many times  I do my loops  And every once in a while  I'll see him  He's all decked out  He takes his biking  Very seriously  Really  He really does  He's like  I haven't seen him  In the last year  But especially five years ago 
[02:35:30]  About he was in the park  All the time  Dressed to the nines  He's so good in that show too  Yeah yeah  The Bengal Tiger  Of Baghdad  The Bengal Tiger  Bagdad Zoo  Bagdad Zoo  I'm not going to make  Broadway a habit  Okay  Dude I've got  This is my fourth show  What if you want to do another show  No I'll go to a few of those  I've got to see Chris Rock  But I can't believe  I like musicals so much  Like maybe it's just this one  I don't want to go to another one  And have it ruined  But like I fucking love this  I didn't plan on loving this  But I want to see it again  I would see it a third time 
[02:36:00]  You saw it like twice in one week  Twice in fucking a week  I would go again  And it wasn't a chore  But Jimmy that's what  I've got to say it again  You're not going to like musicals  I know  No they're certain  You're really not  This is beyond a musical  Is what I'm trying to tell the people  Yeah it is  It really is  Because after a while  When you go to a musical  You're like  They're just wasting time  With another fucking song  There's a good balance  Between the songs  It's a musical  Just wasting time  With a song  No and by the way  For the record  There were funny ass songs  That were cut too  Really  Trey and Matt 
[02:36:30]  And Bobby  They waste no time  They just want to get  To the next  Like they want the story  To keep moving  Right  But like  It was interesting  Over the course of  Three and a half years  To see what went  What stayed and what didn't  Oh wow  There used to be a song  Called Family Home Evening  For instance  That was  There used to actually be  White women in the show  And so Elder Price's family  Would gather around  And they would sing this  Kind of song about rituals  Mormon rituals 
[02:37:00]  And it was hysterical  But they were like  We don't need it  Right  Let's get the boys to Africa  And you know  It's just genius  They just kind of know  How to keep the momentum going  Have there been  Any kind of backlash  From Mormons  Nothing  It's  Because it's a weird  It's almost like  To me  It's a tremendous indictment  Of the arrogance  Of like these white religions  Going to this fucking  Really really bad living conditions  And kind of  Preaching their hometown religion  To people 
[02:37:30]  Who are fucking  Have you know  Shit in the water  And it shows how ludicrous it is  I think  I mean I think  To a certain extent  I disagree  Because  It's  I don't think that  That's Matt and Trey's intention  I think it's not  Necessarily an indictment  So much as it is  An opportunity  To question  Everybody saying  My way is the right way  Your way is the wrong way  But it's also  In a weird way  A celebration of faith  In general  And it's a  At the end of the show 
[02:38:00]  It is kind of a pro-faith show  Don't you think  Like  The celebration  Of the religion  That Cunningham creates  Is  Saying  You know what  These things may be absurd  And they may  You may not agree with them  But  If you can buy into it  It may help you  Yeah  In a way  But it also  To me  I read it  And again  I'm obviously  Know less about it  Than you do  But when they were saying  Like when the villagers  Give their performance 
[02:38:30]  Let's just say  And the things  That they're pointing out  Are so dirty  And ludicrous  But to me  Like you know  The frog  And this and that  To me those are comparable  To the symbolism  In Christianity  Or whatever  The loaves of bread  And the water  Like that's how ridiculous  It is  If you just explain it  Instead of loaves of bread  That is absolutely true  I just don't think  It's an indictment  Of the Mormon church  Necessarily  I think it is  Kind of a statement  On religion  In general  Absolutely  And it is funny  Because we have 
[02:39:00]  A lot of people  Of different religious  Sects  Coming to see the show  And it is always funny  To me  When they kind of  Pass judgment  On the Mormons  But if you do think  About your own  Storyline  It is  As  Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs  Yeah  As you know  It's like  Oh those Mormons  Believe that  No my God  Came back  After a couple  Of days  And you know  And to each  Their own  And I have faith  And I have  You know  Spirituality  But it's all  Kind of the same  It's all relative 
[02:39:30]  I've always thought  The Mormon thing  Was really strange  Though  I mean I'm a Catholic  And I know  I know we have  Some strange stories  I will acknowledge that  But there's Joseph Smith  In Rochester  Yeah  What?  Yeah well I think  Golden plates in his yard  In the 1800s  I think that's the part  That kind of gets everybody  Is that it's the  All-American religion  And it's so modern  And it's like  People scratch their heads  And go  Wait one second  Christ  Came back when?  And did what?  And where? 
[02:40:00]  Where?  And the Native Americans  Were what?  He came back three days later  To talk to  Joseph Smith  Yeah  But you know  Again  To each their own  And fair enough  I mean you know  Like I said  I gotta say it again  We have weird stories  I'm a Jew  We have plenty of weirds  We do  We have a very angry god  He's really spiteful  Yeah  He's just like  Testing everybody  A lot of suffering  And testing  Yeah yeah  You kill your son  Just kidding  Just gotta take it back  Yeah  Turn it off  Like a light switch 
[02:40:30]  Turn it off  Have you listened to the soundtrack?  Yeah  It's on my iPhone  Yes  I'm fucking obsessed  Love that  By the way  I'm trying to figure out  First musical  I've ever even thought  Of purchasing  No really  Les Mis  I wouldn't know Les Mis  If they fucking stood up here  And sang it to me  Oh come on man  Never  What if they sing the lyrics  This is Les Mis  Then I would probably say  Alright gotcha  But no I really  It's just not my  Not my style at all  But this is really  We got the soundtrack  In front of us  I just don't know 
[02:41:00]  If it translates to radio  I don't know  Oh yeah  What song would you suggest?  Why don't you play my song  You bastard  Which one?  Yeah which one  You had a few there Josh  Man Up  Oh yeah man up is right  Man up is right  That was actually  That will run through  My fucking head  Man up is pretty good  Yeah man up is fucking  Very funny  We certainly could play  Man up at the end  Of this segment for you  I like man up a lot  So how long do you think  You're going to be  Stuck on Broadway?  One more week  I'm going to get  After the Tonys are done 
[02:41:30]  I think I'm just going to  Quit  Just leave  We had a friend on Broadway  And he said  Fuck  Doing the same thing  Night  It's a lot  Night after night  It just gets  Exhausting  It's a lot  I mean my wife  Said to me yesterday  She goes  I'm so excited for you  Not to sleep during the days anymore  And I was like  Oh my god  That really is a depressing thought  I sleep  A lot of it  Because it is  It is  You have such an adrenaline rush 
[02:42:00]  After the show  That you just  Kind of toss and turn all night  And it's a lot  It's physically a lot  It's vocally a lot  I've been on vocal rest  All last week  Because of this  You know  Infection  And it's  It sucks  It's like  You know  If I were  Doing any other job  It wouldn't matter  And it has to be said  I mean  It gets boring  After a while  It's a great gig for you  And you're not going to trash  And you shouldn't  But doing the same thing  Day in and day out  It gets a little boring  If you're a creative guy  Like yourself  I would say  Generally that's true 
[02:42:30]  It's not the case with this  It really isn't  In fact  In fact  It's quite the opposite  Because it's such a damn good show  That I really find something new  Comedically every night  To mine from it  And that keeps me  Do you guys tweak it a little bit?  Oh yeah  I mean  By virtue of the fact  That we're doing the same thing  Night after night  For a different audience  The tiniest thing  Goes the longest way mentally  To just keep it fresh  In my mind  But you know 
[02:43:00]  It's  It is a blast  And I'll do it  For a while  How long are you guys  Supposed to be there?  Because I know there's rumors  You're going to take it on the road  How long are you scheduled  To be at the  What is it?  The Eugene O'Neill Theater  Okay  You know  We're all in kind of  A standard contract  Like it's like a year  But  When they do  The tour  And all that  It'll be a separate cast  It'll be a different cast  Really?  You guys won't tour?  No they 
[02:43:30]  They generally don't take  The Broadway cast  And tour them  Because they want to  Keep that going  Once you're on Broadway  Oh okay  I thought they would  Stop it  No no no  That's the place to be  Oh you're so naive  I really  I don't know  I think that the people  On TV are just  Take the whole Broadway cast  And ship them to  Branson, Missouri  Do they carry the building?  No  Sometimes I guess  They will do that  But in this case  I think they're going to  Do a whole separate thing  And then eventually  It hits maybe HBO  Or something right?  You know  I would not be surprised 
[02:44:00]  If there's a movie  Down the road  I think that  It would be  Kind of crazy  For them not to  I'll probably be  Too old  To do it  But I'm sure  That it'll be great  With Justin Bieber  And  Jonah Hill  I don't know  They'll figure it out  Hey did all these  Big stars come back  And say hello to you  Afterwards?  A lot of them do  Will Ferrell  Yeah  I mean  The coolest was  Angela Lansbury 
[02:44:30]  Because like  Over the loudspeaker  I just heard  Josh  Angela Lansbury  Would like to meet you  Wow  And I was like  Why?  Yeah right  What does Angela Lansbury  Want from me?  And I went downstairs  And there was that  Living legend  And you know  It's pretty cool  It's been a really cool ride  She enjoyed it right?  No  She wanted to tell me that  What if she was like  Sir that was the biggest  Piece of shit  Yeah exactly  Nice language  Yeah  Angela  But there are some very  It starts off where 
[02:45:00]  You think it's gonna be  Like a very  Straight  If you didn't know  If the marquee  Didn't tell you that  Matt and Sherry are behind  You think it's gonna be  Like a standard  Quote unquote musical  With some funny songs  And then they get to Africa  When they get  Boy that Michael Potts  Comes out  And immediately  You're obsessed  You're really obsessed  You have no idea  What you just did Josh  But I would've  I would've  I loved him before  I knew he was  Brother Muzon  Because he had glasses  And the wire  And a bow tie  And a fucking pistol  But he was  In this  That song number 
[02:45:30]  Well the opening scene  Of Africa  Just  Tremendous  Just kills  Just tremendous  The guy who walks  Across the street  Let me tell you  The very first time  We did that in a reading  For an audience  I have never been more  Scared and uncertain  In my life  How something was gonna go  Really?  Oh yeah  I mean you think about  Those lyrics  Which I'm not gonna mention  You know  Want the audience  To be surprised  But it was  Insanity  I was like  Oh my god  I hope this works  Otherwise 
[02:46:00]  We're all gonna be  In a lot of danger  Yeah it was  But from the get go  It worked  It killed  The problem is  You don't even have to be here  Because this show  Is sold out for how long?  Yeah  Three four months  At this point  Sold out till 2015  No it really is  It's crazy  So it's gonna be tough  For these people  To get a ticket  It is  It's you know  It's gonna be tough  But you can absolutely  Get tickets still  You know  I do think that  We're sold out  Until September maybe  But you can also  Do lottery  And there's 
[02:46:30]  Standing room  Every night  Oh really?  And they also have  I noticed  The line  For the box office  Was very short  The line where  They're waiting  For cancellations  Was fucking  40 people deep  They're just waiting  Hoping somebody  Is killed in an auto accident  And can't make the show  Hoping yeah  Yeah it's really  I panicked  Because we had tickets  I will call  And we had a crazy day yesterday  So I got down there  Pretty close to show time  Like they probably  Fucking got rid of my tickets  Because I heard about this line  Well then the other thing  Has been  You know 
[02:47:00]  That  Some  Unfortunately  Some people have been  Buying fraudulent tickets  Which sucks  Oh boy  You get to the door  Yeah people should  Check that out early  Just to make sure  That they've  Happened to me once  In front of  Madison Square Garden  For a Knicks game  Happened to me  With the producers  I'll never forget it  I was so pissed  Did you go out  And chase the guys down  Hey you  I told a story  Are you  Are you a big  Basketball guy?  I used to be  I'm starting to get  Back into it  You want LeBron 
[02:47:30]  Or you want Dirk?  I'm from Miami  I'm a huge Heat fan  Fuck!  Another Miami guy  He's from there though  I'm from there  It's not like  I jumped on the bandwagon  But that's fair  I used to be  Going to games  With Ronnie Cycli  It's been  Really difficult  A couple of days  Because they're just  I don't  It's a mental thing  At this point  I think that  I feel bad for LeBron  Because  He's got to wake up  He doesn't  Get eight points  The other night  It is  So unbelievable 
[02:48:00]  How unfair  The media's been  To him though  They're putting  So much pressure  On him  And I think  That nobody  Can overcome that  It's just  That kind of pressure  Is too overwhelming  And one week  He's Michael Jordan  And the next week  He's worthless  You know  It's like  It's a little crazy  And they're  They're kind of  Hot and cold  I think the media  Pressure is fair  Just because of how  He left Cleveland  Yeah I don't agree  With how he did it  I have no problem  With him wanting  To move on  It was just  The way he did it  I agree  I'll never forget  I agree with that  And I think 
[02:48:30]  America agrees with that  He raised two million  For the boys  Club of America  Whatever the charity was  Alright good  That's nice  I think it was a cool decision  Just by virtue of the fact  That wanting to be  A team player  Is cool  But the way he did it  Was gross  Have you ever been to Cleveland?  Yes  I love Cleveland  That's all they had  I know  That's not true  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame bud  Like I said  That's all they had  Now you're getting me mad  I'll tell you what else they have  Giant vaginas  Cleveland is the home  Of the big pussy  I fucking love Cleveland girls 
[02:49:00]  And let me tell you  What the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame does  They go into these  Addicts of rock stars  That have been dead forever  And try to find stuff  That even the family  Of the dead rock star  Could care less about  Alright yeah take this  It's true  I went there  And they had like an exhibit  On John Lennon  And it was like  All of his glasses  Right  I was like that's so sad  It was the glasses he tried on  Before he got the ones he liked  That's the problem  With the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Right there sir  You're having unhappy feelings  Turn it off  Like a light switch 
[02:49:30]  Turn it off  Tim I think you may have a role  In the tour  Oh that fucking guy  Turn it off  You can play Michael Potts role  I would love to play  No I couldn't  Can we tell the people out there  What that song is about  Because that doesn't give away much  Just let's say it's about emotions  And handling emotions  That's brilliant  Turn it off  Oh that yeah  It's just  Someone was  Closeted feelings  Yeah someone was trying  To push down their  Closeted feelings  Just basically  Turn it off  I'm okay  I'm all better 
[02:50:00]  Or whatever  That's what he says  When he stands up  I'm all better  Yeah  Oh this fucking guy  Made me laugh man  He had a Jim Carrey vibe  To him but not on purpose  It was just his vibe  Yeah  With his mouth  And the shape of his face  He's a funny guy  He's brilliant  And he came out of nowhere  Like literally  He was the last piece  Of the puzzle  And they found him  This summer  I mean what else can we say  The thing is great  It's a work of art  And it really is  A masterpiece  I'm glad we got to meet  To meet Josh  Yeah I am too  Well you couldn't get  Trey and Matt  So  Nah  We hope you come back 
[02:50:30]  I would love to  You got anything else  Kind of happening  Out there for you  Well it's  You know  It's kind of right now  All about  A Book of Mormon  But I'm excited  I'm starring in a new  Animated show  Called Good Vibes  Which David Gordon Green  Who did Pineapple Express  Great movie  Yeah  He's genius  I don't have to say that  But  He created it  And it's going to be  On MTV  Starting this fall  Great  And I also have  A web series  Called Gigi  Which is

[02:52:30]  Knowing what he had to do  When faced with his own death  Jesus knew that he had to  Man up  He had to man up  So he crawled up on that cross  And he stuck it out  And he manned up  Christ he manned up  And taught us all  What real manning up is about 
[02:53:00]  And now it's up to me  And it's time to man up  Jesus had his time  And now it's fine  Man up  I'm taking the reins  I'm crossing the bear  Just like Jesus  I'm growing a pair  I've got to stand up  Can't just clam up  It's time to  Man up  Cause there's a time in your life 
[02:53:30]  Where you know you got  Man up  Don't let him pass us by  There's just one time  Man up  Watch me man up  Like nobody else  I'm on a man  All over myself  I've got to get ready  It's time time  Time time  What did Jesus do  When they put nails in his hands  Did he scream like a girl  Or did he take it like a man  When someone had to die  To save us from our sins 
[02:54:00]  Jesus said I'll do it  And he took it on the chin  And he took it on the chin  And he took it on the chin  And man up  And a man did we wrap  Took a bullet for me and you  That's man up  A real man now we're around  And now it's my time to do it  Time to be a hero and slay the monster  Time to battle darkness  You're not my father  I want a time to just watch me go

[02:56:30]  Yes  My god man  He's huge because of the Broadway show  But remember that name  He's going places  Big time  We got Steve-O  Yeah we should bring Steve in  He's 950 already  There was the most horrid music playing in the fucking bathroom  Really  Steve-O  Some horrid jazz  Like shut this fuck  I'd rather listen to Diarrhea  It's horrible  They gotta keep it safe in the bathroom  It's either  Then go with the 80s or something  It's either the Frank Sinatra channel or some Starbucks type channel 
[02:57:00]  No one wants to hear  We're a bunch of nerds  With the dumb drums and piano that don't go together  Jazz sucks assholes  Can we request a better channel in the bathroom?  Eat jazz  Making requests for the bathroom  That'd be good  Why not?  I don't know  They can keep it safe with like fucking light FM music  Something like that  Fucking 80s shit  90s  Steve-O wrote a book brother  I know what the fuck  Professional Idiot 
[02:57:30]  A Memoir  Yeah dude  Great cover man  Great title  We haven't seen you in about maybe four or five months right?  Eight months  It's been that long?  Wow  Are you still sober?  Shit yeah  Fuck yeah  Good for you man  At least you can talk today  Chapter 15 is just called My Son is a Shit Fuck  Oh dad got involved didn't he?  I just happened to open it  That just sold  Oh it's your mom?  Yeah  That's fucking great  You just sold the book right there  A shit fuck  And thanks Steve-O for stopping by 
[02:58:00]  You don't have to sing anymore  If there's a chapter that says that  That's the title of the chapter  My Son is a Shit Fuck  There it is  Why wait to chapter 15 on that one?  Well  I don't know  I guess he was probably a good little boy  Were you a good boy growing up?  It's a special story man  Yeah  That's the best title chapter  Even though Hookers, Trannies, and Makos is up there  Oh my  Yeah that's the chapter where I talk about the time that Tranny sucked my dick in D.C. 
[02:58:30]  How was it?  You'd expect a dude to do a better job man  I was underwhelmed  Of course at the time I didn't really  See I gotta give you the story on this  Because I was told that this individual was a hermaphrodite  Or had been a hermaphrodite  And had an operation to remove the dude parts  Leaving nothing but chick 
[02:59:00]  Right?  You know?  And I didn't  I didn't  You know  Let that  That slow me down  You know?  Like  So I went back to my  To my hotel with this individual  You know?  I was hammered  And I remember feeling like  Okay you know  Here's this hermaphrodite  This is kind of weird  Like  But this person seems like genuinely troubled  You know?  Like they really seem like a sad  Sort of  Like wounded person  And I want them to feel  Like worthy  Of affection  You know?  And like  So I'm gonna 
[02:59:30]  You know  Dude I'm gonna go through with this  Here you know?  And like  So I got this underwhelming blowjob  Like I was snuggled  Played the great fake boobs on this dude  Right?  But the prosthetic pussy was off limits  Right?  What made the boobs so good?  They were just good looking boobs  Because they can't figure that out sometimes  Right  You know?  And later I found out that the hermaphrodite story  Wasn't even true at all  It was a full on  Dude  Oh just a dude  I mean it was like a post op 
[03:00:00]  A post op  A full on tranny  You know?  And I say  I point out in the book  You know that  Fuck man  If I knew it was a full on tranny  Like I  I very well  Might have gone through with it anyway  You know?  Sometimes you have to  For the story  Yeah  And  You know  I say  Fuck man  I've had sex with plenty of chicks  That looked way more like a dude  Than that dude did  Right  This is a pretty good deal  Dude  I'm looking  Your mom looks really hot in 68 here 
[03:00:30]  Yeah she's really hot  That nursing student picture  Yeah  Did you check his mom out?  Yeah I did look at that  That's like  That's like  Oh wow  That's like 68  Fucking yeah  Yeah  I was conflicted about the tranny story  You know  Like Doug put it in  But like  But I  I say that  Like all of our  Like you know  Running around in thongs  And all of our homoerotic stuff  That it's been like  A real noble effort on our part  To rid the world of homophobia  You know?  Right  How can I  How can I say  That I'm not down with homophobia  If I'm not willing to admit 
[03:01:00]  That a dude sucked my dick  Yeah to really  To really make the jump there  And commit  But a dude didn't  She was a lady  And I will die with that  Oh is that  She's a lady  That's how Jimmy justifies it  Absolutely  Right  She's a lady  Who happens to have a penis  So what  She's a lady  Trapped inside the body  Of a dude  Who got his dick cut off  Yes if you want to be  Crass about that  Delightful young woman  That  That waft of man breath  When you go to take a piss later  Yeah  The burps are awful 
[03:01:30]  There's nothing worse  Than a good  A fucking tranny  Pabst blue ribbon burp  Yeah you don't want  The fucking tranny burp  After they blow you  What nationality  What nationality  Was this  Was this  The individual  That was an American person  Was she black  Was she Latin  Or Asian  That's not nationality  I don't think  But there's a Caucasian  Caucasian American  Oh okay  White ones can go either way  Black ones tend to be  Thuggish  You know  And like more masculine  It's harder for black guys  To be feminine 
[03:02:00]  The best ones  I guess  Would be Asian  Can be very delicate  Although some of the  Latin ones  You'd be surprised  Yeah  But they always have a tattoo  That's the worst part  There's always fucking  One man  It's like  You have to have a horseshoe  Tattooed on you  There's no need for that  There's one big man tattoo  They decided  They decided  They decided to make the move  After the tats  Yeah and they have  The biceps are always  Well defined  And they always have  Fucking man legs  There's a couple of things  That will give away  A Latin transsexual 
[03:02:30]  And the cock  That's great  And the cock  Yeah  I gotta ask Steve  As I look at all the  Great pictures in the book  By the way  Thanks man  And I see a fish hook  Through your cheek  I see a leech  Coming out of your eyeball  Oh yeah  Puking  And then your nipple  Being shot  Yeah that's  That's something  That didn't make  We filmed that  For Jackass 3D  Didn't make it  Into Jackass 3D  Didn't even make it  Into Jackass 3.5  Why?  What's the problem?  Because they  They don't want  Little kids  Pointing guns at their chest 
[03:03:00]  And pulling the picture  Or pulling the trigger  So how do you get  That footage out there?  Is there a way  You can get that footage  Out there?  I can't man  I still have the BB  In my nipple  And it says right  On the caption  Of that picture  You know you see  The rifle pointed  At my nipple  Yeah it's sick  You see the after picture  You see this picture?  You see the after picture  Where it went in  And tried to come out  But didn't quite  So I still have  The BB in there  And it says  On the caption  You can feel the BB  You know just ask  You know like a time  Fuck  Well we kind of  All want to feel  But it would be  Really gay  I'd get the 
[03:03:30]  No I would get  The heebie jeebies  Jimmy you want to feel  For the uh  Yeah here give me  Jimmy you gotta do it  For the show  For the show  The BB  You can feel where  The BB is  Oh yeah wow  Why are you keeping  The BB in there?  Because man I love  That shit  So you can get it  You can get it out  If you want  I'm sure I could  But uh  You know like  It's a body art  Can I ask you  After seeing a bunch  Of those pictures  What's the craziest thing  You've done  That you feel you've done?  Uh you know like um  Ryan Dunn  He's another guy in Jackass  I had him uh  He choked me unconscious 
[03:04:00]  Six times in a row  Like he literally  Strangled me unconscious  Dropped me to the ground  Twitching  If you look on YouTube  Under uh  Under Steve-O  Put in Steve-O chokes  You can see Dunn  And he strangled me unconscious  Six times in a row  Wow  Yeah it was really something man  Like uh  Another time uh  I found an uh  An unemployed registered nurse  Talked her into putting  An IV in my arm  And uh  Shot up five ounces of vodka  Through the IV  Did you get sick from that or no?  I remember my arm burning 
[03:04:30]  Like uh  It felt like it was burning  But you know I was  I don't know  It was just a mess at the time  Like I remember  I had my little  I put on my special  Hospital gown  With my butt hanging out  Yeah  I just wheeled the IV  Yeah you were wheeling it around  We all saw it  Yeah  Yeah I saw that one  That must have  Hurt  That's not meant to go  Into your blood like that  Yeah that was  That was  I mean for all I knew  That was  At the time  Like I was really  Rolling the dice  With my life  Yeah that could have  Killed you 
[03:05:00]  It turned out to be  Not that big of a deal  Yeah  Um  I was a huge fan  Of Wild Boys  That's never coming back huh  Nah I don't think so  No  I'm sure it won't  But you guys  Pretty much have done  As much as you can  With that too  It's a travel show man  The last trip  You know I got a funny story  About Wild Boys man  Because like  Every time with  With Jackass and Wild Boys  Whenever we submit  A television show  You know like an episode  It has to go through  The standards and practices  Department right  And so they'll censor out  Shit that they're just 
[03:05:30]  Not going to let you  Put on TV  Yeah  So we always like  Put in shit  That we know  Is just completely  Fucking unacceptable  And like so that we  So it's okay  They're called red herrings  And we know we're  Going to lose that  Right right  But then when it comes  Down to something  That's right on the line  We say hey  You know you took that  You know like  Let us keep this  So like  So we're in Russia  Filming the final episode  Of Wild Boys  And we want to really  Let the standards and practices  Department get a special  Episode right  So our director  Hires these Russian hookers 
[03:06:00]  Okay  We had these  Polar bear suits  With big polar bear heads  And like  So we got these  We got these  Two naked Russian hookers  Just naked hookers  With polar bear heads on  And then me and  Someone else in the crew  With the full polar bear suits  With holes cut out  Right  We're fucking these  I'm literally  Fucking a Russian hooker  On camera  You know  Like we're filming it  Like  Can we do this  So that  You know  So that 
[03:06:30]  And we were so satisfied  With the notes  From standards and practices  Please  Please take out  The polar bear orgy  You know  Like so great  All of that shit  And like  And Jeff Tremian  The director of Jackass  Like he will swear up and down  Like that that was not  He did not pay those hookers  With MTV's money  No  That was his money  Came out of his pocket  Right  Hey when you shot in Moscow  Did they know you there?  No  Well I don't know  Maybe yes  A little bit here and there  Maybe something 
[03:07:00]  A little bit here and there  Man like when we were  When we were in Russia  Like there was some  Like novelty shop  And they had like  This like 9mm handgun  Like cast iron handgun  But when you pulled the trigger  It was  Like a lighter  You know  But this thing was a  Fucking cast iron  9mm replica  Right  And so we  Fucking show up  At the airport in Moscow  We're flying out  And our fucking line producer guy  Like the uptight red tape jerk  You know  Like I fucking  We pull up to the airport 
[03:07:30]  And I go  And fucking stick this gun  In his carry on bag  Oh man  Oh shit  And like we're  We're trying to go  Through the airport  And fucking  I mean dude  Cops are like swarming  From all over the airport  They got this fucking dude  Like  It was awesome man  Before moving on  From wild boys  What's the one animal  You were scared of  Or creature  Or insect  The most intimidating one  I think was  Was a wombat  You know  I mean obviously  Like  Obviously  Venomous snakes  Big cats 
[03:08:00]  And bulls  You know  Like they pose  A real threat  You know  A real scare  But the most angry  Fucking  Son of a bitch  Was called a wombat  What is a wombat?  It's somewhere between  Tasmanian devil  And koala bear  And just  It's fucking pissed man  What do you  How big is it?  It's just this little  Fucking pissed off  Hedgehog looking thing  It's just angry  All the time  Yeah  Yeah  I remember  There was no  Like  We were in  It got like  One of our shoes  And just fucking  Just like a paper shredder 
[03:08:30]  To the shoe  And there was no  Getting us back in there  What did you have to do to it?  I'm sorry  What did you have to do to it?  It was just  You know  Like that's what  Wild Boys was  It was basically  Go to zoos  Fucking get in the cage  And hope to bleed  You put those  We were talking about this  The other day  You put those gloves on  With the ants inside  Yeah  What are they  Fire ants or some shit?  Nah  They're bullet ants  Man  Right right  Bullet ants  Fire ants are really  Not that big of a deal  Man  Yeah compared to bullet ants  I'll never forget  Because we were 
[03:09:00]  On another trip  And like  I don't know  Some other trip  And we did like  One bullet ant  And fucking this shit  Was fucked  We were crying  You know  That fucking thing  Was a glove full  That sons of bitches  A glove full  And like  What the fuck  Could that feel like?  Dude  It was  There was probably  That was probably  The worst  The worst  It was pain  As far as like  As far as the animals  Yeah  How long did you last  In the gloves?  I don't know  I can't remember  There was one glove  Pontius had at first  His hand looked like 
[03:09:30]  Fucking Mickey Mouse  His fucking hand  Like the next  In the next day  His hand like literally  It was all swollen  Yeah  I got it  I got it a lot easier  Because I put the glove  On after Pontius  Which means I was  Sharing needles with him  Yeah pretty much  But  Oh man  But yeah  Like the Venom  Like they were running  A little lower on it  So I didn't get it  Quite as bad  They were all tired  And used to a hand  By the time you got  A little cigar  And a hand  Fucking false alarm  Yeah you guys  Were screaming  Yeah  You know 
[03:10:00]  And it's not  I mean I guess  People like the footage  But it's not the kind  Of thing that really  Translates man  You know  It's pretty pointless  To have done it  I found it  Hysterically funny  That show  Just whenever you guys  Would start really  Getting pissed off  Like no I'm not  Fucking doing this again  That's it  Right right right  For some reason  That was some of  The funniest shit  Sure man  You know you don't  Want to see a guy  Who's all gung ho  Like sure yeah  No  Screw that  That's why I think  That's why I think  That my footage  In Jackass 3D  Was like really 
[03:10:30]  Like improved  You know  Because I was  Fucking hating it  You were petrified  Here I'm totally sober  And I'm like  Fucking dude  I'm doing this  And you know  I was dreading this shit  More than ever  When I'm doing it sober  But I was also like  More eager to do this shit  Because I'm like  Man I'm gonna  Fucking prove  That this shit  Didn't turn me  Into a pussy man  Yeah yeah  You were great  In Jackass 3D  A couple people  Saying 3.5  Better  They liked it better  Even which  Hard to believe  I haven't seen it yet  What kind of  Stuff is in that  You know  I'm certainly  A more macho 
[03:11:00]  Character in 3.5  You know  Like  You know  Jackass 3D  Was like  I just did  All the gross shit  You know  But like  The more brave stuff  Like  There's this  They have this  Fucking box  That  It's called  A rat zapper  You know  And it like  Lures  Fucking big ass  Rats into it  And it operates  On like  Six huge D batteries  You know  And fucking  The rat gets  Lured into it  And it just  Gets electrocuted  To death  Right  I was in this  Fucking halfway house  And my roommate  Was just killing rats  All day long 
[03:11:30]  Fucking  With this rat zapper  So I'm thinking  Oh man  I emailed Jeff Tremaine  The director  And I'm like  Dude  Let's get like  A metal  Like wind up  Like mouse  Or rat  We'll connect  A fucking  We'll connect  Metal wires  To the  Fucking  To the  Wind up metal  Rat  And fucking  With alligator clips  On the end  We'll connect  The clips  To my fucking  Balls  And we'll send  The fucking  The wind up  It's so funny man  We did it in 3.5  Fucking wind up  This little son of a bitch  Fucking  And it's just  Like walking slowly 
[03:12:00]  Into it  I'm duct taped  Down to this  Big ass chair  Because I know  There's no chance  Of me fucking  Like not  Like interfering  And oh my god  That was horrible  Fucking electricity  Into your balls  Pretty brave thing  To do man  Yeah  You didn't test it first  You just  On camera  They tested it  On the  On the fucking  The prop department  Guys  Poor bastards  But they just did it  On like  On like whatever  Yeah no  It seemed like  That could go  Bad  And then another 
[03:12:30]  Thing in 3.5  I wound up  Hospitalized  With second degree  Burns up the whole  Left side of my body  This fire gauntlet  Bullshit  I'm on this  Fucking  This balance beam  Over all these  Like fucking  Hot coals  And you know  Flames  And all this shit  And they're  Swinging these  Flaming kerosene  Balls at me  To knock me  Off the balance beam  And Jeff Tremaine's  Like yeah  It's not gonna  Show up anywhere  Unless you  You know  Get laid out  And fucking  You know  Like decided to  Land with my  Whole body  Hot on the coals  Wow  Man 
[03:13:00]  Yeah real brave  Guy you know  Are you  We're promoting  The book obviously  A lot of the stuff  Is in it  Steve-O  Professional Idiot  A Memoir  You still doing  Stand up  I am dude  I've been on tour  Non-stop  Since I was here  Last year  You're loving it  I'm loving it dude  You know like  It's kind of like  I've been doing  Like as much  As stunts  Like I'll do  Stand up for like  30 minutes  And then I'll do  Stunts for  30 minutes  You know  So I'm like  You know  So you're beating  Up your body  Every night  Big time man  And like I was 
[03:13:30]  Thinking stand up  Would be a good way  To like preserve  Myself you know  And like not have  To kick my own ass  So much  But like  Shit man  Like it's a  Steve-O show  So I feel like  I really you know  I just don't know  How to not kick  My own ass  For a Steve-O show  You know  And like  In these comedy clubs  I'm doing six shows  Per weekend  And so like  What was supposed  To preserve me  Is just infinitely  More abusive  With all the repetition  But I just got back  From Australia  And New Zealand  And did theaters  Over there  So I mean  I was fucking  Just getting covered  In blood  And engulfed in flames 
[03:14:00]  And was going for it  Like back in the day  You know  That felt great man  I wanted to do more like  I want to like  Not do comedy clubs so much  Just cause I have to  Repeat them  So now I'm thinking  About trying to  You know  Get like  Some of the rest  Of the guys in Jackass  And put together  Like a  You know  A little traveling show  Yeah like I used to man  It used to be like  Me and Wee Man  And Dunn  Or Pontius  You know  It was like me  And two of the other guys  All the time  And we'd do big theaters  And like  I think it's time  To bring that shit back  You know  Do you guys get together  Aside from when you're working 
[03:14:30]  Yeah you know  Like I mean  We do  Typically  That involves  Everybody getting hammered  And I don't need  To be around that  You know  Like it's important  For me to check  My motives man  Like if I'm gonna be  Around people getting loaded  Like I gotta be like  Okay what's my reason  You know  Do I have a legit reason  What do you do  When you're  You know  To not drink  I guess  Is the  Picking up some hobbies  Or anything  Golf or anything  Yeah I'm a real whore  Is that  You never know man  I might have to do  Something about that too 
[03:15:00]  Oh the sex  It's brutal  Brutal  But um  It's uh  I mean  It's like  Anything else man  You find people  Who have more experience  With that shit  And you can get  Connected with them  And you know  You just don't try  And do it on your own  I ask  Because a lot of guys  Are struggling out there  Yeah big time man  It's uh  Very interesting  To hear your story  You know  You can't  You can't make someone  Want to get better man  You know  Like uh  I needed the  Like the helpful nudge  Of getting locked up 
[03:15:30]  In the psych ward  The way I did  And thankfully  When I  You know  It is so funny  When  You know  You got a serious  Fucking problem  When the jackass guys  Come over to lock you  Up in the psych ward  You know  Yeah yeah  Those guys  Like  Probably the worst  For an intervention  How bad did you want  To point fingers at them  Uh  Well you know  Like it  It wasn't really like that  I mean  I could have pointed  Anything I wanted  Yeah I know  And uh  And they were  It wasn't a yes or no question  You know  It was like  We're taking you  You know  You go willingly  Or we kick your ass  Oh kick my ass  Okay I'll go  You know  And uh 
[03:16:00]  You know  So I get there  I get to the hospital  And I'm all belligerent  And they take  They change my  Three day involuntary hold  To a two week involuntary hold  Because I'm fucking  Throwing chairs at people  You know  And uh  And so I had two  Two weeks on my hands  To sit in a psych ward  And think about it  And you know  After like  Seven days  Like I got to the conclusion  That I needed  To make a change  You know  But I wish  You could hammer it  Into people's heads  That they need to  Get better  But you just can't  You know  So uh  Yeah there's 
[03:16:30]  There's no shortage  Of people out there  That are  That are getting  To that point  Does it get easier  A question for Jimmy too  I guess  Yeah  Does it get easier  In some ways  Yeah  And in some ways  No  Because like  In the beginning  You got like  All that  Like you know  All the wreckage  And devastation  That you've  You know  That you've brought about  With your shit  Is just so fresh  And you've got  All this desperation  After like a few years  You know  You get your life back  You know  You're like  Got all things to do  You know  You're busy 
[03:17:00]  You know  You got the money  You got the relationships  You know  And so like  The maintaining  The sobriety  It's hard to  Squeeze it into  Your new busy schedule  You know  And if you don't  Maintain the shit  Then uh  Then you're gonna lose it  You know  They say  Whatever you  Whatever you put  Before sobriety  You're gonna lose anyway  So put sobriety first  And it's tough to do that  Once you've got  Your life back  You know  Yeah  So that makes  As I once heard  Don't let the  Don't let the gifts  You get in sobriety  Keep you away from sobriety  Right  Yeah  I was at dinner 
[03:17:30]  Last night  And someone was  Someone was talking  About like  About you know  I don't know  If it was like  The art of war  Or something  You know  And like  They said  Yeah  You know  Like  Key to  You know  To fighting  Is the element  Of surprise  And I'm like  Wow  That's a really  Honorable way  To describe  To describe  A sucker punch  The element  Of surprise  Which by the way  Could be one of the best  Parts of Jackass 3D  That fucking boxing  You know  When we shot 
[03:18:00]  Holy shit  When we shot  That fucking  We shot that fucking  BB through my nipple  Right  My nipples  Gushing blood  I'm standing there  And this is what  Didn't even make  Fucking 3.5  I'm so pissed about it  Dude  And I'm standing there  With my nipple  Gushing blood  And I'm like  Fucking  I'm going  Oh dude  I'm so happy  It stayed in  That's what I wanted  I got a BB in my nipple  It stayed in  This is great  And then  Boom  Fucking  Bam  Bam  Comes behind me  With a goddamn  Boxing glove  And fucking  Straight up  Breaks my nose  The slow motion 
[03:18:30]  Shit looked great  He fucking  Broke me  He moved my nose  Like fucking  It's still fucking  All fucked up  Man  I'm sitting there  I got shut up  At the hospital  With a fucking  Broken nose  And a BB in my nipple  And they're like  Yeah we can't do  Anything for your nose  And I'm like  You're not touching  My nipple  I need to keep  I need to keep  That BB in for work  I love how everybody  Was walking around  Covering their balls  Yeah  Every scene  You would just see  Like if somebody  Was in front of you  And you were behind  Because everybody  Was just doing that thing 
[03:19:00]  Where they reach back  And punch the other guy  In the nuts  It's fucking painful  It's fucking nuts  Okay dude  So let me tell you  About this fucking time  Like I love this story man  It's got  It's got some  Some behind the scenes  Jackass shit  Okay so I'm hooking up  With this girl  When we start filming  Our first jackass movie  And like  As soon as she pulls  She pulls out my wiener  Right  And like as soon as  She gets my cock out  She feels like  She needs to tell me  Something serious 
[03:19:30]  Right  Like it's super awkward  She pulls out my cock  And she looks at me  And says  I was in a bad car accident  And I'm like  What the fuck  Is that about  I'm like  I'm sorry  You know  Like  So then she says  Get ready to have  A really good time  And this chick  Fucking takes out  Her upper teeth  She just takes out  This fucking like  Dentric plate shit  Because she lost  Her upper teeth  Holy shit  In this car accident  She lost her upper teeth  Right  Like 
[03:20:00]  I got fucking  Knocked out by the steering  Wheel of some shit  Oh man  I don't know  So uh  So this fucking chick  Takes out her upper teeth  She fucking goes down  On me  Right  And like  I mean I'm a premature  Ejaculating dude man  I am talking  I come  I got a small  Crooked ass dick  And I come  Fucking fast  Right  That's also a great title  For your second book  You know  You know  Like  The best title  Would have been  Tears on my jizz rag  Okay 
[03:20:30]  Okay so this chick  This chick goes down  On me  And I mean  This is like  The fucking fastest thing  But I think to myself  Holy shit  This isn't a  This isn't a hummer  This chick's giving me  She's giving me  A fucking gummer dude  You know  And I'm like  Dude I couldn't even wait  I couldn't wait  To go sell Knoxville  And the gang  You know  I'm like  Holy shit  Dude this is fucking fantastic  And that's what  They thought too  They were so  Happy with this story  They fucking found  A shark with no teeth  To bite me  In the first movie  And that's the story  Of the whale shark gummer 
[03:21:00]  Yeah that's how  We fucking did  I just fucking love that  Wait did she  Were you able to  Pop quick with her  You blew a load  Oh see  Gum job would  Fucking kill me mentally  I wouldn't be able to do it  Why  I wouldn't believe  That it was a car action  I think her teeth  Rotted out  Or she did fucking meth  And  I don't want to  Fuck her in the ass  You know  That would probably  Make me come even faster  And I'm still thinking  Like this girl's got  There's something sexy  About no self esteem  And like  Total no regard

[03:24:30]  I said chemical peel  Chemical peel  Is what Roland said  Wow  I did have a mole  Removed from my chin  That must be it  Is that face work  Yeah it's plastic surgery  So how are you feeling  After yesterday's events  Um  I mean  Is it exhausting  For you to be  The center of attention  For as much as you were  Kind of weird  Because uh  No one has given a shit  About us for four years  I noticed  Am I the only one  Who noticed  That today  The web team  Is in here  To videotape Steve-O 
[03:25:00]  After yesterday  We got our YouTube video  All over the uh  All over the news  Kind of weird  It's been four years of  Who gives a fuck  About those guys  And out of nowhere  We have a massive story  Um  But we'll go back to  Being the  Who gives a shit guys  Soon I'm sure  I did hear that  Um  They may throw us  A big pizza party  On Monday  For all the cameras  I did  I did  I did  News cycle restarts  On Monday  So tomorrow  Will be another  Good day for you guys  And then  Monday it's back  To who gives a shit  I guess  Now they're moving on  From us aren't they  Already  I think so  Well here's the problem 
[03:25:30]  And this is something  I was worried about  What did you feel like  When you found out  Uh  Yesterday afternoon  After getting all  This attention  That his wife  Is pregnant  Cause that right there  Started shifting  Attention away  That right there  Cost you a couple  Front pages  I think  That's right  I mean we didn't  Discuss it on the show  But  You know when you're  Dealing with powerful  People  Yeah  They got  They got um  The best as far as  PR teams go  Yeah  And that was so  Calculated yesterday  So they were sitting  On that just in case  So they could distract  In my opinion 
[03:26:00]  Yeah  I know a little bit  About this game  Yeah  That makes a lot of  Sense  Cause why  Which makes it creepy  To say back a big  Announcement like that  But  Yeah  I don't know  I mean maybe it was  Just timing  It would have made it  We would have  We would have looked  Really dirty  We look  We look like we have  A little dirt on us  But  We would have looked  Really dirty  If we tweeted the photo  After the pregnancy  News popped  But you still would have  Done it  Yeah  Yeah  There wouldn't have  Even been more thought  I mean you spent  It was just so funny 
[03:26:30]  Cause today  I think what made  This one easy to do  Was the fact that  This was coming out  No matter what  Right  I'm not trying to  Justify anything  I'm really not  But  No but I mean  That's what makes it  Really easy  Knowing  This photo was  It was so obvious  It was gonna hit  And like you said  Breitbart was showing  Everybody he knew  He met you yesterday  And he let you  Hold his phone  With the picture on it  He was  I mean  The homeless Charlie guy  Yeah  Exactly  The homeless Charlie guy  He got his comeuppance  Nah I mean  Ant went on national television 
[03:27:00]  Though and said  That it was not  This was not planned  I think it was just  Convenience  It wasn't planned  No  Do you think  Is he mad at us  At this point  Breitbart  I think he would  I think he just praised  Howard on his Twitter  Which is  Oh that's a little  Passive aggressive shot  You think  I think so  That's what I'm thinking  Because he's off  He's  But that's what people do  When they're trying to like  You know  When they try to get to us  They always  You know  Try that tact  But  Cause that way  And he could do it  Without actually insulting you  So he could be like  Hey  Don't take it that way  I honestly  Could say 
[03:27:30]  That tact  Has never worked with us  No  Not really  But you can see  What it is  Like you can see  That people are being  Passive aggressive  They're not  He's not just  Randomly complimenting Howard  Cause he didn't do  Howard's show yesterday  You nailed that  It's kind of  Passive aggressive  I guess  Yeah  He's just trying  To take a little shot  And then be able  To step back  And say  Yeah  I didn't say anything  I did the right thing  I told the truth  I believe  That Andrew Breitbart  You did  Had no intention  Of releasing that picture  Anytime soon  Right  And that's  I mean  And that's the same thing  You guys  But my heart says  My soul says 
[03:28:00]  That he wanted that picture  Out there somehow  Some way  We're all in agreeance  That he didn't want  The picture released  Yesterday  Yeah  Not to say  That the picture  Wouldn't have been released  At some point  But you know  What I mean  If he's gonna sleep on it  If he's gonna brag  About having this picture  You guys know  He's gonna release it  Sometime  You might as well  Take it a little  Something for yourself  Sorry biggovernment.com  Doesn't get  You know  The hits  Right  Breitbart's like  Fez  Passive aggressive  You hear that Opie  Yeah we're gonna get 
[03:28:30]  Into that tomorrow  That's based on  I mean you guys  Can get into it  After I leave  In about 10 seconds  But  That's it for you  Huh  You did the whole  After show yesterday  And that's another thing  You today  You were like  Hey we both tweeted  We both tweeted  But yesterday on the  After show  You were like  Fuck I gotta get the credit  And you know why  You got all the credit  On the news  Cause I took the picture  Of Ant's phone  Because  You did  At Gawker  Gawker was the first  Website to post it  Because they saw  Your tweet  Gawker is the one  That gave you the credit  And then every other  News place just took 
[03:29:00]  Gawker's story  Yeah we both tweeted  We you know  I mean it was  We were just having  Fun with that  Yeah  It was just being goofy  We knew at that point  We were gonna send it out there  But you won the battle  Not really  I think  I think somebody else  Won the battle  Who's that  A third source  Third party source  Mr. Maloonigan  Mr. Maloonigan  We were dying laughing  Now the news is gonna  Pick up on this  It might have been  Tweeted by  Well I'll say it  A listener before us  Yeah it was  Might have been  I mean we 
[03:29:30]  I don't know for sure  There was like  Four twit pics  Going on at once  Either way  It's out there  When the camera  Captured it  We knew it was  Definitely gonna be  Out there now  Yeah  So at that point  We're like  Alright well  We might as well  Attach ourselves  To the story  A little bit  Of course  I mean if  If it's out there  And there's  Photo evidence now  You know what  Let's let's let  Everybody know  Where it came from  And that's a little  Press  I thought it was  Very funny though  Because I was  Getting a lot of  Tweets and even  Text messages  From people I know  Saying oh boy  Are you guys worried 
[03:30:00]  Is there gonna be  Worst of tomorrow  And that's because  Nobody's used to  Opie and Anthony  Getting positive publicity  Like everybody thinks  If we're in the news  It means we're  Probably fired  It's not over though  You think it could  Get ugly  It always has this  Like lull period  The guys and gals  That have been with us  For a long time  They know that  We always come back  And do the show  After the big show  Always  Oh so today  Today's  There's always a lull  I'm not trying to like  Cause a buzz  I'm just  I'm 
[03:30:30]  No you're right  Because there was  The Anthony Michael Hall  Show that he was  Supposed to do  Right before you guys  Got fired  Yeah he was very angry  When he came back  Yeah  I honestly think  We're fine  But I've been around  Long enough to know  That sometimes  Things just develop  That you didn't see  It's like the shirt  Before the shirt  It's the show  After the show  What are you after  It's like streaming  It's delicious  And then like  A few hours later  Yeah  Catches up to you  You didn't even see it coming  I think I'm gonna have  An official video  On the Roland vs Fez  From my TV studio  Also known as my bedroom 
[03:31:00]  You're gonna just  Talk about it  Is Obi Rans  Do you want the official statement now  I would love the official statement now  Do you want me to  Do you want me to video you  Making the statement  Uh no  Fez  Fez mocked Roland  For crying yesterday  Yeah  But let's remember that  Fez  Cried  When  Because I asked him  What Batman character  He would be  Roland cried  Because he felt  The entire  Uh  Felt uh  The weight of the entire company  Thank you  Yeah  The weight of the entire company 
[03:31:30]  This Sirius XM satellite radio  He was feeling that  Yeah  He was feeling the stress  Of the weight  Of this entire company  And it broke this man down  Yeah  That's my official statement  Now I'm ready to attack and kill  So you're saying  And there's  There's been wonderment  Yes I do blame  Ronnie B  You're leaving  On that note  Cause you're saying  Number one  Roland cried  Because he had the weight  Of an entire  Publicly traded company  On his shoulders  Right  Whereas Fez cried  Because he wasn't sure  Which Batman character  He wanted to be  Exactly  And  You're saying this Opie 
[03:32:00]  You believe Ronnie B  Is behind this  Uh  I'll say it again Sam  Mmhmm  I'm suspicious  You're just questioning  You got questions  I'm suspicious  Okay  You're suspicious  Of Ronnie B's intentions  Shall we say  I'm watching him  Okay  Is he the puppet master  He thinks Jay Moore  Has gotten to you  And Jay Moore  Put this into your head  I know  But that was his spin  To try to throw me off  A little bit  Oh  That was a little  Puppeteering  I thought about it  In between watching myself  On TV  I'm like  Was that a move  By Ronnie B 
[03:32:30]  To throw me off the trail  Cause then you're thinking  Of Jay Moore  And then you go  Wait wait wait  Let's get back to  Ronnie B  Yes exactly  Wow  Cause he got me yesterday  During this show  Mmhmm  He threw the Jay Moore thing  And I'm like  Yeah Jay Moore  I bought into  And then I'm like  Whoa whoa  Look who's saying it  Ronnie B  Could this puppet master  Be spinning this  In a different  B  Wow  30 days in the home  I just got a text  From Club Soda County  That says shut up  And let him go home  30 days in the home 
[03:33:00]  I love the way  News breaks on this show  Alright alright alright  Thank you  Opie for stopping by  I will say this  I haven't seen Fez  That active  And funny  In a long time  So if it takes me  To break down  To make him  Have a good show  Then so be it  Wow  You don't mind  Being the fall guy  Do you know what  He was actually  I was laughing  In my life  Like wow  He's actually  Vicious and funny  It's been a long time  So if it takes me  For him to do that  Then so be it  You're saying it  Doesn't happen often  Yeah 
[03:33:30]  It's kind of like  A sporadic  But I was like  I was like  Oh man  He's funny  Attacking me  When he  Every time  When a caller  Make fun of him  He goes  Oh I'm rolling  I was like  That was kind of funny  But you're saying  It really  That that's the first  Time in a long time  Um man  I've been in New York  Ten years  Yeah  Ten years  Yeah  Yeah  Long time  Wow  Iraq  Are you hearing  I hate not having  A monitor  Yeah I'm hearing it  What happened  To the monitor  I don't know  We came in this week  And Mars says 
[03:34:00]  Oh uh  Stuff's broken  How's it broken  It was working  I have no idea  He shook it twice  It didn't work  You think that's  How Mars fixes things  Just shaking  Yeah  Oh  Um  But I have to say  He was funny though  I wasn't mad at Fez  But I thought  That was pretty funny  But you're saying  That it takes  Something like that  For Fez to have  A good show  Is what you said  Yeah he was like  Ficious  On point  Like a  He was like  Really on fire  Yesterday  Eric are you  Going to isolate  This for Ron and Fez  No  Could you at least 
[03:34:30]  Write down  Write down  What time it happened  Do I have to  Well yeah  I mean  Throw Pepper Hicks a bone  He's going to have to  Cut it either way  All right  It's not really  Insulting him  It's just like  Well  I'm giving him props  But you're saying  It doesn't happen often  Yes  Okay  Well I'm glad  We got everything  On the table  Because I know  I believe tomorrow  Opie wants to talk  More about  Your thing with Fez  And what Fez  Was saying about you  Because he definitely  Heard it  Heard about it  It's a whole show 
[03:35:00]  Prep  That's why I say prep  That's advice  Well yeah  That'd be all about me  You're still writing down  This time right  Eric  Yeah I'm writing it down  Okay  Eric's going to write down  This time  Hopefully  Right now I'm crossing  Just banging his head  Like oh god  Oh what am I going to do  I'm not mad  He's worried about  Sirius XMU  Causing all these problems  Yeah  See but the thing is  I love Ronnie B  And I love Fez  So it's like  I thought it was funny  I'm mad at you  Now Raul  I'll talk about  Your breakdown later  Because I want to 
[03:35:30]  Talk a little more  Can I slap you?  No please  I want to talk a little more  About of course  Wienergate  But that's the one thing  That I was bummed about  Not getting to talk about  On the after show yesterday  Was your breakdown  That was the one thing  Besides Wienergate  That was a huge deal yesterday  So I mean we will  Talk about that  And also Spencer  Was on all  Back behind the scenes  With all the video  Yeah  Oh yeah  Spencer  See the thing is  The way this whole thing  Started yesterday  Was obviously  There was a Twitter war 
[03:36:00]  On the after show  As to who  Opie or Anthony  Could tweet out  These dick pictures  Quicker  And I had no idea  Eric  Did you know how quick  This would happen?  No  Roland?  It's just like  The counter had like  1200  It was like  Low all of a sudden  Yeah  Blew to like  20, 30, 40  I know I talked to  Travis about it  We were both like  Do you think this will  Go anywhere?  And we agreed  That like  One website  Would have to pick it up  And be reliable enough  For other websites  To pick it up  And within 
[03:36:30]  20 minutes of it happening  Gawker had it  And we were like  Okay  Within two hours  It's just spread  Exactly  We go okay  Gawker has it  That's pretty big  And then all of a sudden  Mediaite  And then it pops up  On  Salon.com  Salon  Yeah  And then Village Voice  Was the first newspaper  Website to have it up  And I went uh oh  Then Post Daily News  Every place had it  And then you know  We started hearing  People tweeting in  That Fox News  Was talking about it  On the TV  So it was  I mean 
[03:37:00]  Even KTLA had it  It was a huge story  KTLA had it too  Yeah  The local LA channel  Yeah  The best was  Later in the afternoon  When uh  The article from the LA Times  Posted that they  Called the White House  For them to comment  On these photos  Really?  Yeah  Wow  So Coke Logic  Ends up uh  Pretty early in the day  Taking our audio  Which was good  He got a little publicity  For himself  He took our audio  And uh  Put it with a picture  That E-Rock had posted  And just put it up  On YouTube  So that's when the  News people started 
[03:37:30]  Having uh  Audio to go with the story  Our fifth host  Vincent D'Onofrio  Vincent D'Onofrio  Have you heard anything  From his people or anything?  Has anybody heard from him?  But I think it'd be good for him  Because it's like  It promotes the  Last final season  It just gets his face out there  Yeah  Oh wait  They're already done  With their last date  I was gonna say  Do you think they'll work this  Into a storyline  Because they take their stories  From the headlines  In the paper  From the headlines  Or they could do the  Final final show  Yeah just do one bonus show  Um  And then  I got home  Around 3-3  Uh  3-30  And realized 
[03:38:00]  I had the video  That I taped  And so I was like  Let's get this up  And so I edited up a video  So everybody could see  What happened  And I mean  We didn't even send this video out  I sent it over to Opie  We both tweeted it  But within an hour  Of posting the video  It started popping up  On TV  Your video is like  The Indus Sopranos  It just ended  Yeah I mean  Because the camera turned off  But I tried to put a little  Fade out or something  So it seemed like  Yeah well  Whatever  It's a YouTube video  It's supposed to be quick  CNN seemed to be the one 
[03:38:30]  That was going for all the videos  Like Fox would talk about it  Yeah  And MSNBC would talk about it  But CNN grabbed the video  Opie did from his apartment  And then started mixing in  The one that you cut up  But yeah  And Colbert played the video  A whole bunch of TV outlets  Played this video  And it's just so funny  Because the more press we got  Regardless  Not many people were saying  Oh  Opie and Anthony  They're outrageous  They were like  What was  You know  Breitbart doing  Passing his phone around  But the more news coverage  We got  The more people 
[03:39:00]  I got saying  Oh boy  Are the guys in trouble  For what?  Do you wish now  That you did what Steve did  Label your videos  Oh I just put a big  Not Sam on it  No because  I don't believe in  Okay  I actually just got a text  Speaking of text messages  From Jim Norton  And this is actually for E-Rock  Are you listening E-Rock?  Yes  Tell stupid Eric  To shut up with his  Blithering questions  How does that make you feel buddy?  Well I accidentally lost  This photo disc 
[03:39:30]  So I guess we're even  Whoa  Um  But yeah  No you didn't  It was  Huh?  No you didn't  No you didn't  It was a huge day  For the Opie and Anthony  Show yesterday  The bosses are all  Still today  I mean  Gary and Rob  Were both ecstatic  They both said  They can throw everybody  A pizza party  Wherever we wanted  Did they really say that?  Really?  And congratulations  They said  You guys  Sam another exclusive  Yeah I didn't  Exclusive  We gotta get some kind of  Sounder for that  Because this is the third  Exclusive in two days  I'll play the tape  Contact that

The company  Gary  And Rob  Management  Wow  I know  They were psyched  Yesterday  About coming up  And like  We were all  Alerting each other  When the  Oh Daily News  Just posted it  Oh oh oh  Gawker just posted it  And then today  Congratulations all around 
[03:40:30]  But as I told Opie  The web team  Came in  To film Steve-O  Why?  Like let's be honest  Somebody said  How did Opie and Anthony  Get that video up there  On television?  We gotta get the web team  In there  So I mean  Did we get an exclusive  From Steve-O today  That's gonna end up on CNN?  Yeah  He jizzes very quickly  Yeah  Thanks for the tip  I got another text  E-Rock  What?  Jim Norton  Of course  Please apologize to 
[03:41:00]  Fat Tits for me  So Fat Tits  For Jim Norton  Sam that's not funny  Fat Tits  That's not funny  No it's not  Do you accept the apology?  I do accept that apology  Okay  You just answered to Fat Tits  So  You doing alright?  Eric?  Yeah  Okay good  I would describe  How Eric is looking  Right now  But the monitor  Has been taken out  Of the studio  Which I hate  Because I love  He's giving you the theme  Is he?  No not really  Well  Like I said  We are gonna talk about  Rolling your breakdown  And it all started 
[03:41:30]  I listened to the replay  You took a shot at Jim  You did a whole bunch of stuff  I would  I say I was an asshole  For doing that  Tim  I deeply apologize  For that for Jim  You completely broke down  But first  I wanted to remind everybody  That it's not like  We never get our videos  On television  Because  It can be the simplest things  And this is why we film things  Like everybody says  Like  They are aware that  I'm in the studio  With video camera  When we have guests in  But they're not aware of  What happens to the footage  I don't post most stuff  On YouTube  Just cause I don't have time 
[03:42:00]  To make a video  Every single day  But when something happens  We just have it  And then we have the ability  To  Put the  Nicole  Come in  Roland can you go  Ask Nicole  I want to go  Find out  If the morning mashup  Is jealous  But the thing is  That you put up  You know  When something happens  In the studio  You throw it up  On YouTube  And then all of a sudden  You can get coverage  For instance  Yesterday  If we hadn't been  Filming at all  We wouldn't have this 
[03:42:30]  Nicole  Is the morning mashup  Jealous  Of  The number one  Morning show  Serious  CNN  Fox News  All every  Well that doesn't make you  The number one morning show  Well yeah  Eric  Of course it does  We have sweepers  Sweepers  What'd you say  He said of course it does  We have sweepers  Number one morning show  Television  Internet  Radio  Everybody's talking about  The Opie and Anthony show  Yeah it doesn't make you  Number one  Maybe you're just getting  A lot of attention today  Nothing but love for the show  Management said

[03:44:00]  Use Anthony's mic  You remember  Because he said  No black people on the mic  We never mentioned  That Anthony said hello  To the morning mashup  The other day  He stopped in the office  Oh yeah  And Stan got in his face  In his face  He's like  Yo what you talk about  I can't use your microphone  You racist mother  You  That shit better not be true  Because that's ridiculous  And Anthony's like  No no no man  I don't  No no you know  It's just joking  Yeah Stan doesn't  Fuck around  Hi guys  Did you check  Did you check out  Stan's outfit today  Speaking of Stan  No I didn't see it 
[03:44:30]  He's dressed like  Like a Harlem  Check out the shorts  He's dressed like  A Harlem Globetrotter  I tweeted it  I tweeted a picture of it  That's mashupnicole  Is the twitter name  It's a pretty epic outfit  I didn't think that  Black guys still wore  The full uniforms  Is that what he's doing  Stanley T does  And you know  It's funny  When we all went down  For Rich's wedding  He had his wife  Pack for him  So he's on the phone  Being like  His wife packed for him  Well yeah  I mean who else  Would do it  That's her job  Yeah that's her job  She cooks for me  She cleans for me  She packs for me  She wipes me  She cleans me 
[03:45:00]  Jesus there is some  Venom here  That does not come across  On the mashup  So she's packing for him  And he's like  Yo make sure you get the  You know these shoes  To match these shorts  He's matchy matchy  Everything  And usually full uniforms  Yeah  But like you can match  Clothes like  Without being matchy  Matchy right  Yeah well he's Stan  Is it a basketball  Uniform he's wearing  I don't know  If it's a basketball  Or a baseball  Is it shorts  It's shorts  It's pink stripes  And he said  Yo it says Brooklyn  So I liked it  Because that's where I'm from 
[03:45:30]  He doesn't really care  But he's from Philly  Yeah and then he gets  He gets other teams  Outfits like  He'll get anything  That he thinks is cool  I like the color  So I got it  But that's not your team stand  Whatever  I like the color  Well I've heard  That goes on a lot  But I didn't think  That people still wore  Like a full sports uniform  Well Stan's not everybody  But even athletes  Don't wear it off the court  Well because they get  To wear it on the court  Stan doesn't get to wear it  If he doesn't wear it  Off the court  So this is like make believe  This is like make believe  He's pretending  He's a basketball player  100% 
[03:46:00]  He came in a costume to work  Yeah dude  You gotta check out the picture  He really  I don't know why  He wore that  But we've been ragging on him  All morning on our show  Because it's not  Because Stan wants to be  A basketball player  When he grows up  Not Halloween Stan  Does Stan wear baseball caps?  Yeah as long as they match  The shoes  Does he wear them  Where he doesn't fold the rim  And has the sticker  And the tag still on them?  He's got a couple of those  But I think that's because  He's trying to be cool  He's got some old school ones  That he squeezes the rim  Eric that's what  A lot of people do that  That's retarded  He also  That didn't 
[03:46:30]  I'm sorry  You're upset with Eric  Because what is that  We're talking about  Stan doing something  That people don't do  Not that people do do  People don't do that  Everybody  Every kid does that  Well  A little thug  That's it  It's in style though  What's not in style  Is wearing a full uniform  And then he makes sure  To get his  He gets a lot of his hats  Like specially made for him  Like they'll make sure  To say Stan the Evans  Like across it  Why?  Yeah because he wants  Everyone to know his name  Isn't that like  When you're a kid  You're taught not to do that  Because people  Pretend they know you 
[03:47:00]  And kidnap you?  Yeah he thinks  Things are specialized  That are cool  There he is  Walking up the hallway  Oh fuck  I was going to try  To throw to a bit  But oh my god he is  We're going to get in  A freaking fight  Stan or Sam  Why do you have to do this  He's coming in to yell at me  Well because you're hating on him  Thank god for Troy  Look he's giving me the finger  Wow Stan is flipping you off  This is the mashup  That you don't see  You can't  Thank god  Thank god for you Troy  He asked me  Thank god for you Troy  You got no life  No no I didn't ask you  You're taking off my ass  Stan  I was telling her the story  What's up Sam  I was telling her the story 
[03:47:30]  About you getting an ant's face  And all of a sudden  Nicole goes  Hey Sam  Did you see what Stan  Was wearing today  And I go no  That's just how you talk to  You know what though  He said  I didn't know that  Full grown men still wore  Full uniforms off the court  I said it is weird  To wear an athletic uniform  It's kind of a costume  Like I want to be  A basketball player  When I grow up  Oh wow  I said that  But that's the way  She described it to me  Shut up  You saw it  No I didn't  Look  I pulled this out of the closet  I woke up  It was 82 degrees  What does that have to do with it 
[03:48:00]  It was hot  Yeah but you can wear  Shorts and a t-shirt  That are not like a uniform  I think it looks great  I'll take you to court  I think it looks awesome  I'll take you to court now  Talking all that crap  Yeah basketball  Since you're teasing me  Let's go  Let's go play  No but if I went  No no Sam  Wait wait Stan  We'll play a 10 point game  I'll spot you fucking nine  How about that  How about this  If I play basketball  You guys just make one basket Sam  And you win  If I play basketball  I would have to change my clothes  You came to work  Prepared to play  I would actually have to go to a locker room  And change clothes  Kenya come here 
[03:48:30]  What's Kenya doing in here  This is my friend Kenya  Shut up  I know who Kenya is  She's been on Opie and Anthony before  Okay well she's back again  This is a girl  For those of you who don't remember  Who gave her number to Vinny  From Jersey Shore  And somehow  She ended up getting a job here  I don't know how it happened  Shortly after that by the way  Yeah  Shortly after that  I don't know  Why they hating on my outfit  Why  I don't know  He looks good  He's refreshed  He's fresh  Refreshed  He feels good  I think  He probably feels good  Yeah  I mean he probably feels athletic and airy 
[03:49:00]  Like he could go for a jog  Or play basketball  But not like he's a human being  Who walks around  And you know  Is  Troy  You know  I wore this outfit  Because Jim Norton was following me around  And you motherfuckers are taking pictures of people's dick  I'm not having that happen to me  I'm just saying Nicole  Wait what did Jim Norton say that you looked like?  Ted Cobb  No not Ted Cobb  Ty freaking Cobb  Ted Cobb  Ted Cobb  Ted Cobb  I was so paranoid  He was trying to shoot a picture of my dick  I was like  I'll see you later Jim 
[03:49:30]  It's a navy blue and white  But it's navy blue with white pinstripes  It's like an old school baseball uniform kind of  Because it's not a jersey like a tank top  It's a t-shirt jersey with shorts though  You can see a picture at Mashup Nicole  It's a great outfit  Troy what were you just going to say?  Y'all look out of life  I think he can pull off anything  Sand coat  That's right  That's right  He walks around and he rocks different outfits  And he looks good  Yeah  Not wearing the same old shirt all the time  Corduroy in 90 degree weather  Who's wearing corduroy?  Flannels  Whatever the fuck  I know there's a flannel shirt somewhere 
[03:50:00]  I'm wearing a blue t-shirt  That's right now  There's a flannel shirt in your office  Corduroy  You wear flannel shirts in the fucking 100 degree weather  When have I ever worn corduroy?  Probably under your flannel  I didn't see  Stan  You do wear flannel shirts all the time  Is that true?  Troy  Answer the question  No I don't wear flannel  I wear plaid  Dummy  That's true  Troy and me got into an argument  Did this motherfucker just call me a dummy?  Yeah  Troy and me got  You said I wore corduroy  Troy and me got into an argument  Off the air about fashion the other day  And Stan was there  So Troy  True or false  Stan's trying to use all of your arguments here 
[03:50:30]  Those are all points that you brought up  Hey hey you were getting on his case  First of all he looked fine  He was wearing  He was wearing culottes  You said you had on some fucking capri pants  He didn't  They were culottes  He just had his pants rolled up  And he had on an easy motherfucking e-shirt  And you're getting on his case  Well that's a different issue  What's up bitch?  What's up?  What are you doing?  That's a totally different issue  Go look up Ted Cobb  Alright and see what it looks like  Listen  How about you look up Mandingo?  You  Wow  What does that mean?  Yes you should look that up  Let me just put it this way 
[03:51:00]  It's not something you're going to talk about  On the morning mashup tomorrow  Now Stan  Coulottes are no culottes  Troy can rock what Troy rocks  You still have a sports uniform on to work  And Nicole is the one  That brought this to the attention  Of after Opie and Anthony live  Believe it or not  I was going to throw to an Opie and Anthony bit just now  Yeah  I was getting ready to throw  I was setting the whole thing up  Nicole comes in here and goes  By the way  Did you see what Stan was wearing today?  No  We're not filming this  So Sam just did the black woman neck roll 
[03:51:30]  How did you do that?  That's impressive by the way  I was hung out with some black woman in my time  Okay I got you  Okay that's pretty impressive Sam  Yeah  Yeah  But this is something  I mean this is a BV  And she by the way is sitting here  Making fun of you saying  I'm not  Now we're going to  All the grievances  She's taking another picture now  Of course she is  Nothing but love Stan  All the grievances that she has towards you  Yeah  On that mashup show  That she can't bring out on the mashup  Because you guys got to be friendly  And back to the music  Yeah  She comes on here  And unleashes  And unleashes it on you Stan  I got to  You know why this all went down? 
[03:52:00]  Why?  And not because of my outfit  Because back in the day  You know I was  You know  Nicole's ass is the American flatlands of America  It is  Let's just say that right now  There is  So Nicole  There's not  Dislike me for that  Matter of fact  Troy you're  You know  Stan and me have been  Hugging the mic  If you could say  True or false  Nicole flat ass  She's wearing a dress today  So I really can't tell  No but you've seen it  You know I got no tush  It's fine  I have no problem with it  Let's be honest about it  I mean  It is flat  She doesn't have a big booty  It's fine though  But I make up for it elsewhere  I 
[03:52:30]  Wait do you have breasts?  Yeah they're huge  That's not making out  No  Well she does have nice breasts  Yeah but she has  Let's go back to the ass thing  Where is it?  What happened to it?  No ass at all  No  None  None  So you just wanted to  Bring that up  Or did you have a point?  I just had to bring that up  I have to defend myself somehow  What's that to do with the outfit?  You keep talking about my outfit  I could talk about your flat ass  That's fine and you do  So now I'm talking about your outfit  Okay I'd rather have a whack outfit  Than no ass  Maybe you should throw to an  Opie Anthony  No no no no  What are you trying to get rid of this tension?  That's not what we do here  This isn't the mash up  We live in the tension 
[03:53:00]  Because what Stan is saying is  He could put on a new outfit  But you'll still have a flat ass  That's what he's saying  It's what Stan is saying  Oh that one hurt  Oh look  You can change your outfit  I can't change my tush  I can't put in  I'm not going to get implants  I do squats as much as I can  It doesn't do anything  Sorry  I can't grow a tush  You can change that outfit  That I'm tweeting again right now  Wow  Mash up Nicole  Check it out  Dang man  She's going to get some followers for this  Who would have thought yesterday 
[03:53:30]  On After Opie and Anthony Live  This whole thing  That put Opie and Anthony  On every TV station in the world  Yeah I woke up this morning  You guys were on CNN  Everywhere  Every paper in New York  That broke here  On After Opie and Anthony Live  Today  I heard you crash Twitter  Yesterday  You crashed Twitter  Damn  Today  The Stanley T  Uniform controversy  Breaks on After Opie and Anthony Live  Will you forgive me  If I crash Twitter  With this picture of your outfit  It's not going to crash Twitter  It would be cool if it did  Actually I think people will see the picture 
[03:54:00]  And actually just quit Twitter  I'm not going to log on to this anymore  Where's my space  Where's the dick pics again  Those were more comfortable to look at  Than Stan  Wow  In his uniform that he came for his morning  You do a morning show  What are you doing wearing a sports uniform  It was just hot man  It was just hot  So I just grabbed whatever  You know I saw  You do a morning  You come in in a uniform  You challenge me to a basketball game  Stan  I'm a radio show guy  You're a radio show  So am I  So what are you doing in a uniform  And challenging people 
[03:54:30]  First of all  He doesn't have to explain what he wears  He doesn't  To you especially  He doesn't have to explain that to you  I dress like a guy  I wear a t-shirt and jeans  You look like you're just  Just plain Jane  You know what I mean  He comes in  He looks  You know why  Because I don't see  Roland what do you think  Of Stan's outfit  He's walking around  With a Krispy Kreme box  Mr. Rob Cross gave it to us  That's very fattening  That's fattening  So you can grow an ass  Hey  What did you say Eric  What did you say Eric  What did you sneak in there  Wait wait wait  What's up E  What did you say  You heard it  I got buried 
[03:55:00]  You know what Eric just said  No  He said maybe you should have  One of these donuts  So you can grow an ass  If that works baby  I'll eat the whole box  I say you're fat with a pH  Not an ass  Oh I see  Alright thank you baby  She definitely  I went  Grab a donut  Troy  I'm hungry  You know Roland had a tough day yesterday  What happened to Ro  Why  What's up Ro  You know  Can I tell him Roland  I mean it was on the air  I'm going to tell him anyway  He completely broke down on the air  What happened Ro  Like you cried  Yes  Oh shit  There was real tears on me  Do you have that clip Eric 
[03:55:30]  He cried  Hold on  Ron and Fez played it  Just to bring them on board  Oh yeah  Not taking shots  Okay  Okay  Yeah  Ron and Fez played it yesterday  So it must be in the system somewhere  Because Roland is under a lot of stress here  As a guest booker  Of course he is  Number one  Management is making certain demands  And then just putting it on to Roland  Not to the talent  Then Roland has to come in here  And deal with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton  Which  Ask management  Is no easy task  And he's the one who's got to deal with 
[03:56:00]  Both of these onslaughts  Right  Yeah  So stuff is getting piled up  And piled up  You remember what happened  With the Paris Hilton thing  You guys lost the Paris Hilton in it  Yeah  We did  Roland  Because a video went up  And it shouldn't have gone up  And releases this and that  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  Roland ended up getting in a lot of trouble for this  You know  And things were said  And Roland's got all this stress on him  Finally  This gets blown off  Finally  Okay  Everything's back to normal  Roland gets in here  Yesterday  And we have Glenn Close booked  You know  The  The  Academy Award nominated actress 
[03:56:30]  Yes  And Anthony comes  Into the studio  And starts the show  6am  With  I said I didn't really want Glenn Close  So we're going to go ahead and cancel her  And Roland goes  No you're not  It's  Later today  You could have told me yesterday  But it's today  And so he's going back and forth  He's like  You told me that it was okay  There were two of you  Blah blah blah  And finally  So Glenn Close made you cry  No no no  Finally  Roland just broke down  Did you find the clip Eric  Yeah I got it  Okay and this 
[03:57:00]  This is  This is what the  The end of it was  And listen by the way  Ant goes from  Saying  Yes  We're canceling her  Listen how quick his tone changes  Okay  So do you want her or not  I'm just so stressed right now  Roland  Are you okay  I'm just so stressed  No calm down  Calm down  Oh my god  Roland it's okay  We'll get Glenn Close in  Get Glenn Close  Oh my god  Did you fake cry 
[03:57:30]  No  It's okay  Shake it off  Mendo fake cry  Yeah  Deep breaths  The stress of this place  Is going to kill people  It's just going to kill people  There will be corpses  From people just fucking  Dying of stress  Well that's why I'm  I'm sorry  That's why I'm out of here in a year  Dude  I swear  What the fuck is that  It was the realest thing  That's ever happened on this show  I was sitting in that chair  Roland was standing right next to me  And I was sitting there  You know 
[03:58:00]  Throwing in my little jabs  While this was going on  Thinking we were all having a good time  But it wasn't  And all of a sudden I look  And it's  He's beet red  There's two  I go  This  You know what it was  Whoa  It was the straw that broke the camel's back  It wasn't anything about Glenn Close  It was like he had been  Enough  It was enough already  Plus  Roland I believe  Lives in a world  Like for me  When I get all  Very stressed out  I get very honest  And I can say a lot of things on the air  I have that liberty  And it relieves  Right  That  Level of stress  It's cathartic  It's cathartic 
[03:58:30]  Roland doesn't have that  Because if it's not management  If it's not Opie and Anthony  If it's not a publicist  It's someone else  Who's paying attention  To every word that he says  So he can't throw anybody under the bus  He can't even say something  If it's true  Because you don't know  Who you're going to offend  And so everything gets bottled up  And then all of a sudden  He's like  Look  I'm just trying to work  With everybody  And that's what happens  Is that right Roland?  Yeah  But  Anthony  It all worked out  So they took Glenn  It worked out  They took Glenn  It was a great appearance 
[03:59:00]  The whole show yesterday  Was awesome  Oh my god  I feel like  Do you see how the tone  In the room has changed?  Wow  Sorry Ro  I didn't know bro  And you guys were  Bickering about clothes here  Not realizing that  Some real shit was happening  That Ro was in fucking pain  I mean I feel like an ass  I mean he's been  He's been in  Much better spirits since then  Because that turned out well  And  Five drinks later  Had a couple drinks  And  The Anthony Weiner thing  Breitbart  Vincent D'Onofrio deal  All happened  Right  And he got releases 
[03:59:30]  Signed by all of them  So he's in the clear  He's like yeah  Do you want a spoon  Or something  Or hug  Yeah give him a hug  Yeah give him a hug  See what you can  See what you can  Do it real quick  See what you can  I'm gonna hold you close  I'm gonna push my bosom  No screw that  Give him a reach around  Go ahead  Hug him tight  Roland squeeze in tight  Don't worry about HR right now  Get the crotches  Pushed together  That's a move  That you can do  In a hug  Stan you give him a hug  A full body  Roland just a tip  Alright I'm gonna hug  I don't think he wants  A Stanley  There's another female  Right there  In Europe  Yeah that's a good point 
[04:00:00]  Can you go give him a hug  Give him a hug  You can hug me  After you change your outfit  Another hug for Roland  It's a beautiful thing  Because Vincent D'Onofrio  Did you see that  He was in studio yesterday  Yeah yeah yeah  We talked to him yesterday  While all this Breitbart stuff  Was going on  Yeah  So he ended up on CNN  And all these other places  And nobody even mentioned  That like  He's not an Opie and Anthony  Show member  He's Vincent D'Onofrio  Oh my god I love it  I love it  And Sam's camera work  Was a little shaky  Oh you're taking shots now  Crybaby  I wanted to come over 
[04:00:30]  And hug you  But I don't want HR  To get on my case  You understand  Yeah  I hear you  Are you having HR issues  Yeah I think everybody is  I mean I'm not  Who is everybody  Well after today  They're listening right now  Look  Behind these mics  Everything is safe  Right  My ass  Are you having HR issues  Yeah I hugged Ro  And it was inappropriate  I don't believe that  I think  You know what I think Nicole  I think there's a real HR issue  There is  And Stan doesn't want to talk about it  We're not going to talk about it  Because it's over  But there was one  Yeah  Wow 
[04:01:00]  HR doesn't have a lot to do  This week  Here  So they make up it  Would you blame this on HR  Or the person who  The person  It's actually not HR  It wasn't HR's fault  It's the person  But then HR is forced to do something  But we're going to move on  Sam  Do I know this person  Yeah  This Roland  Yeah  Yeah  Let's move on  Some of the legal systems  Listen I got to go get the 411 going  But I love you  Are we going to be in the 411  Hey I got to go get the 411  Yeah are you going to put  Opie and Anthony in the 411  I should right  Yes you should  Look I mentioned them on Hits 1 last night  You did 
[04:01:30]  It's a big story  It is a huge story  But to be fair you're on every channel  That's true  After after  By the way I was on Hits 1  Do you know last night  From 10pm to 6am  It's amazing dude  It's crazy  You're taking over  Yeah  I like that dude  After this O&A after show  Thing is done  Can you come hang for a little bit  Yeah sure  Alright cool  Love you  Alright peace out  Tell me who was the HR issue  I'm not going to tell you  Don't you dare  What does the name  Don't you dare  What does the first name start with  I can't even tell you  Male or female  I can't tell you  Sam  I'm leaving now  I'm going to think female  I'm going to guess Mikey Piff 
[04:02:00]  Thank you for stopping by  Was it Piff  Was it Mikey Piff  He's not around  I promise not to hug him anymore  Sam  Yeah  Is Mikey Piff tight sweater  It said enough  And then it just broke free  And then we saw a stomach  I love the old Roland's back  For a minute you were gone  You snapped right back though  Poor Roland  There was some real venom  Going off with the mashup  Yeah there's some real tension there  I think we should  I like that we can get  More of that on here  Yeah  You know and if anybody  Didn't like that  Then I don't know  What you're listening to this for  Because this is what  This is all about  What do you think 
[04:02:30]  They say about Ryan  Huh what did you say Roland  What clip are you playing today  Yeah uh  Never mind that clip thing  And Eric just asked  What do you think  What do you think  They think about  Well Eric what do you think  About Ryan  I'd never think about Ryan  Oh Jesus  He's a nice guy  Who is he  Yeah  He's a member of the  Morning mashup  Ryan Sampson  He fills in when Rich is gone  No he doesn't fill in  He's a full time member  Oh  Um  You got any DJ gigs tonight Troy  I know you're just DJ  You're DJing almost as much  As I'm on Hits 1 at this point  You've gotten the last two nights  With no sleep correct 
[04:03:00]  Yeah  No wonder you've been  A little punchy  You've been a little irritable  You said the 675 bar  Me pack districts  Was rocky last night  Was it  Yeah it was a lot of fun  I pulled an all nighter  I'm still up from yesterday  I'm a fucking train wreck  Yeah you look like  You pulled an all nighter  Yeah  But next Friday  I will be in Redding Pennsylvania  At Club Reverb  With Q-Ball  From the Bloodhound Gang  Wow  I know Eric will be there  He's a big Bloodhound Gang guy  Yeah  So it'll be a party  So if you're out in the  Redding Pennsylvania area  Stop by  You look like shit  Yeah  You feel that way  I feel like hell  Thank God for Adderall 
[04:03:30]  Is that what you're doing right now  Just pop some pills  Until you get to what  1 o'clock 2 o'clock  Yeah  No then I have something else going on  But it's  What you got going on  There's a clinic  Of this program  That I'm using  In the city  Oh shit  It's a free clinic  Any clinic?  No it's like  This program that I use  Called Ableton  There's a clinic on  Look Rob Cross  If you're listening right there  What I want you to do  Is do me the biggest favor  And spend  Can you cream?  He's talking about the free clinic  And take as much time  As you possibly can  To get Troy those promos today 
[04:04:00]  Let's make this a late day  For Troy  I'm sure he will  He always does  Doesn't he?  But in his defense  I'm sure he will  I'm going to grab one of those  And I have time to do so  Because that's it  After Opie and Anthony  Live is finished  I think I'm going to try to think  Of a new name for this show  That's not the shit hour  Because I can't get  I can't get  After Opie and Anthony  Live over  And the shit hour  Is over like gangbusters  Imagine a scene  And does it  The shit hour  Just embrace it  The shit hour  Just embrace it dude

But I'm still up there  And I would ask the fans  For ideas  But they'll actually  Send me ideas  That are more negative  Than just calling it  The shit show  It'll be about  How much they hate you  Yeah so  Thanks for listening  And Ron and Fez  Are coming up next  This has been  After Opie and Anthony Live </pre>
