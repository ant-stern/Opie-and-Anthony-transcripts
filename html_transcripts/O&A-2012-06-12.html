<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with commercial breaks, followed by a discussion of humorous online videos, including one of people falling off a pedicab.  The conversation then turned to Apple's business dealings with TomTom, prompting speculation about insider trading and Apple's subsequent stock drop.  One host reminisced about using Google Maps to explore his childhood neighborhood in Southern California, highlighting the significant changes and loss of familiar landmarks. This led to a discussion of his father's past financial troubles and the fate of the family ranch, concluding with a humorous anecdote about his deceased horse, Nightmare, being found on a beach after a flood.

The LA Kings' Stanley Cup victory was discussed, including one host's live-tweeting of the game and subsequent online arguments with fans. The presence of porn star Taylor Stevens at the games and resulting viral videos were also mentioned.  A substantial portion of the show focused on two videos:  the first featured a white Buffalo resident arguing that racial segregation is a solution to prevent neighborhood conflicts after a fire; the second was a raw, unedited video depicting graphic violence, drug use, and frequent racial slurs within a predominantly Black community in South Florida (initially misidentified as various locations including California and Africa).  Listener calls followed, debating the videos’ content and the issues raised.

The show then delved into a highly charged and profane discussion about racial issues in America, focusing on socio-economic disparities and perceived lack of responsibility within some segments of the Black community.  The conversation, sparked by a news story (possibly involving a house fire), included heated exchanges using offensive racial slurs.  The hosts and callers discussed historical injustices, systemic issues, personal responsibility, and societal structures perpetuating cycles of poverty and violence.  A caller shared his experience escaping crime and gang violence.  The hosts also discussed videos of a father killing and shooting child molesters, debated the father's culpability, and engaged in a lengthy, graphic, and offensive discussion about Jerry Sandusky and child molestation.  A Jesse Ventura clip from Piers Morgan, where Ventura discussed his refusal to fly due to airport metal detectors, was also played.

A significant portion of the show revolved around a past, contentious interview with Jesse Ventura.  The hosts recounted Ventura's departure from the interview, physical contact with Jimmy, and their ensuing heated exchange.  A clip from the interview was played.  Ventura's conspiracy theories regarding the Gulf of Tonkin incident and the TSA were discussed.  The hosts also spent considerable time graphically describing leaked photos of Snooki from *Jersey Shore* and detailing graphic accounts from the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse trial testimony, including descriptions of the alleged abuse and the use of gifts to silence victims.

A segment focused on listener calls concerning inappropriate behavior by coaches towards underage athletes, including showering with players and other forms of inappropriate touching.  A caller, Brett, detailed his experiences with Jerry Sandusky.  Several other callers shared similar experiences, spanning various sports and age groups.  The segment then shifted to a rambling, highly inappropriate phone call with a person claiming to be Jay Moores, who engaged in crude jokes and impersonations, interspersed with discussion about working with Andrew Dice Clay. The segment concluded with the "What did you learn today?" segment and further discussion of the O.J. Simpson trial anniversary and other tangents.

The final segment addressed phone screening for the show.  Luke mentioned being blocked by Eric on Twitter.  The conversation shifted to Eric's role in uploading shows to Audible, with Eric claiming lack of responsibility for delays. A contentious call with "Uncle Paul," who recounted sexually suggestive and disturbing anecdotes involving children, ensued.  The hosts argued with Uncle Paul about the veracity and interpretation of his statements.  The bulk of the segment focused on a new intern, Connor’s struggles with phone screening, including discussions about various inappropriate callers and differences in call-screening protocol between Opie & Anthony and Ron & Fez.  Former intern Bobby called in, emphasizing the intensity of working for Ron & Fez. Several other callers contributed to the discussion, with the segment ending with a discussion of Connor's performance and the hosts’ expectations. A humorous anecdote about a former intern, Paulie, drinking excessive orange juice was also included.

[00:04:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:00]  She looks like a Johnny plug. 
[00:05:30]  It's very mushy.  It is.  And you got the LA Kings winning the Stanley Cup.  Yes.  And you got fat people falling over on a pedicab.  That was funny.  And what else today?  I don't fucking know.  I don't fucking know.  I don't fucking know.  I don't fucking know.  Oh, Apple shit.  I'm so fucking pissed off.  There's a little company that is helping Apple do their mapping.  Tom Tom.  Tom Tom.  Yeah.  If we knew about Tom Tom yesterday, we would have had to have been told by somebody and that 
[00:06:00]  would have been insider trading.  Why can't we just guess this shit?  I know.  It's amazing how they can keep secrets from the general public.  Right.  You know, for the most part, when they make announcements like that, no one knows about  it except, you know, some insiders.  There might be shenanigans going on like that.  I don't know.  But you got to be careful because there are people watching.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  They fucking watch it.  They watch these stocks and go, oh, really?  Why did you just buy 100,000 shares the night before?  We'd like to ask you a few questions about your stock purchase.  So what are they doing?  A Google Maps thing?  They're trying to take out Google Maps now?  Yeah.  Google Maps is doing their own thing.  Yeah.  They're fucking, they went, they're going from the satellite view to actually mapping aircraft.  There's aircraft that are going to take various angles of the same location like they do  now, but it's going to be various angles and a lot, a lot higher resolution to four inches. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  And it's going to be 3D also because they're, they're mapping it from different angles.  So they'll have, they'll have up to four shots of the same location and be able to put them  together for a more 3D look.  How the fuck do they do that?  And again, the resolution of four inches is getting a lot of people up in arms and you're  getting a lot of these civil liberties, people saying that it's an invasion of privacy  and you have an expected privacy that's being infringed upon. 
[00:07:30]  If you're out in your backyard and you're reading your mail, technically somebody could  zoom in and see what you were reading as far as your private mail.  We've talked about privacy.  We leave the mail in the fucking yard.  I do.  A lot of times I, uh, privacy is going to go away.  It's, we've all talked about it.  You can't stop this technology.  Maybe you could slow it down a little bit, but it's here to stay.  Yeah.  But the point is Apple makes the deal with Tom Tom to help him with this shit.  Yeah.  If we knew. 
[00:08:00]  You'd get, um.  Wow.  You'd, you'd have some bucks.  And then Apple took a shit yesterday, I guess.  Oh, they did.  Nine bucks down.  They went down nine bucks.  Yeah.  Well, the announcements sounded pretty good yesterday.  Yeah.  But it's always buy on rumor and sell on news with stocks.  Right.  I don't understand why that's the fact, but whenever they're talking about what Apple might  do and there's going to be an announcement and stuff, everyone like starts buying and  the stock goes up and then whenever they make the announcement, the stock fucking goes  down. 
[00:08:30]  It's all stupid.  Yeah.  It's, it's an odd thing, but it's a really, it's really tough to figure out.  I see an Apple buy today unless it shoots up pre-market and there's no way to get in  early.  Let me see.  Oh no.  Let's see.  He was down $9,044 yesterday, but I see a $90.  At least at nine, $9, $9, $9, $0,44.  Yeah, yeah, $9, I might buy some options today though.  God, if it was down 90 bucks, that would be a problem for a lot of people.  So, yeah, whatever.  But yeah, I mean, are they going to be able to compete with Google Maps?  Apple?  They think they can. 
[00:09:00]  I don't know.  I think that TomTom announcement's weird because I guess it's their, their GPS angle is what  they're going to be latching onto, TomTom's GPS.  But that fucking Google thing with the very high resolution and 3D mapping and stuff,  I think that goes a lot further than what Apple's got in store.  You Google Map?  I like Google Mapping.  I like Google Mapping.  I was Google Mapping last night, as a matter of fact.  Why?  I was trolling around the area I grew up in, in Southern California. 
[00:09:30]  And I saw the actual road that went into where we used to have our little ranch and everything.  It's just gone.  Everything's wiped out.  Oh, really?  The dirt roads are still there, but everything on that property, gone.  Why?  It's so many years have passed.  People have just done other things.  Wasn't there a ranch there though?  There was.  So why is the ranch gone?  That's the question.  I followed the trail.  We used to ride up to go into the hills.  The same place where I took a Dreamweaver on the ride. 
[00:10:00]  I did.  I would go up the trail, and the second I get to the top of the hills, fucking houses  everywhere.  Oh, wow.  There used to be giant, vast hills and lakes and all kinds of shit.  Where you could finger that pig.  Right.  And it was all houses.  Nowhere to hide anymore.  And you know where else there were houses?  Everyone's going to see you.  You know where else there were houses?  Where?  That fucking tree that the tree fort was in.  Oh, boy.  Gone.  Oh, boy.  All houses now.  You can't relive that glorious night.  You can't relive the tree fort, Richard. 
[00:10:30]  You can't relive that glorious night.  I can never go back to that eucalyptus tree.  That lotus finally been wiped up.  It's not gay because you were snoring.  That's right.  I do that, too.  Now it's a fucking house.  I Google map places I used to live.  Yeah.  I've lived in close to 20 places.  I don't know if I've ever talked about that.  I was averaging two places a year for a while.  Check that shit out.  It's kind of cool because then it brings back these weird memories.  Like, oh, fuck.  I remember that dumb little alleyway.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It is kind of weird to be able to look at it now.  But, man, San Juan Capistrano and Southern California in general has been so built up since then.  It's amazing.  Everything I remember is fucking built on.  That sucks, though, doesn't it?  It's all built on.  I always want them to build everywhere else except for places that I kind of remember as being kind of in the wilderness and spread out.  One thing I'm very surprised at, though, is San Juan Capistrano has been able to protect their hill fronts. 
[00:11:30]  Like, all those rolling green hills, they haven't built on the fronts of them.  Like I said, you take that trail up to the top of the hill where I used to go riding.  Go on the other side.  That's all fucking houses.  But I guess they're not allowed to build on the front of the mountain.  They want to keep that look, that nice fucking...  Yeah, but who gives a fuck about the look if on the other side it's...  It's a facade.  It's nothing but a facade.  Right, right.  Yeah.  So you don't have connections out there anymore?  None whatsoever.  You don't know what happened to the ranch. 
[00:12:00]  If I go into the Swallows Inn, I could probably get some information there.  But, yeah, it's just fucking development.  Well, when your dad died, who was living on the ranch still?  I guess it was taken over by the...  Did he own the ranch?  ...by the county.  Well, own is a term when you owe a fuckload of money and didn't pay it.  Do you think his bills were paid up when he passed away?  Oh, man.  Whoa.  Do you think he died in debt?  Oh, there could have been a little debt in my dad's fucking afterlife. 
[00:12:30]  In his portfolio?  Oh, he still owes wherever he is.  Do you think his portfolio was a bit thin?  Oh, yeah.  That manila envelope had maybe one piece of paper in it?  I think, yeah, a lot of debt.  So, yeah, it was taken over.  And then now, like, I guess what was the ranch is now some kind of a riding stable for the handicapped or something.  Wow.  They did that. 
[00:13:00]  But everything else is just wiped out.  There was a giant barn and shit.  And I guess the river got pretty high at one point and took a lot of the shit along with it.  Including my dead horse, Nightmare, who was buried in the pasture.  And from what I heard, it was a nice little burial.  They took the backhoe out and dug a big hole and threw my horse, Nightmare, in there and buried her up.  And then there was a harsh winter one year, and the river got really high and eroded away the land.  And Nightmare was found in Dana Point on the beach. 
[00:13:30]  No.  Yeah.  They actually found her?  Yeah, they had a whole Nightmare away.  Bring her back up.  Nightmare's bloated fucking body was found on the beach.  Your horse?  Yeah.  Nightmare reappeared?  My horse seat.  Yeah.  Nightmare was gone.  You know what?  And then everyone lived the Nightmare.  Yes.  Imagine seeing that shit.  The fucking dead horse.  You know what a horse mouth looks like when they're dead?  It's a big fucking...  How'd the Nightmare die? 
[00:14:00]  Uh, Nightmare just, um, died.  I don't know.  Just up and died.  Pretty skittish horse.  Was it a gummy mess?  Yeah.  It was like fucking...  Ugh.  Lip goes up and they got those fucking teeth.  Oh, it's crazy.  And you did all this on Google Maps?  Yeah.  Yeah, you just go around Google Maps and, uh...  Nice.  Nice.  Zoom in, check it out.  Nice.  It was fun.  You don't have to travel anywhere anymore.  Nah, you just fucking virtually sightsee.  I wonder how Geneseo is doing. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  I'll check it out tonight.  Can you go Street View?  Yeah, Street View.  They can check out...  They took down the old pizza joint.  It's like, I remember standing here and spinning around and looking at everything, just like  I'm on Street View.  I don't even have to be there.  God, life is weird.  It is odd.  Never thought that shit was...  There's a lot of change going on in our lifetimes.  It'll happen.  And I wonder if this happens to every generation.  It just seems like a lot of shit has changed since we appeared on this fire.  It just appeared on this fine planet.  Look at this shit.  You can just zoom in on any place. 
[00:15:00]  What is this now?  Geneseo?  Yeah, that's Geneseo.  That's the campus, though.  Who gives a fuck?  I hated the campus.  The campus never went there.  Go to town.  See if Aunt Cookies is still there.  What?  The old subjoint.  Sounds delicious.  So, the Kings, I told you they would win.  Yeah, I was live tweeting the hockey game, much to people's chagrin.  Yeah, you were pissing off a lot of tennis fans.  Well, you know what happened?  You were pissing off a lot of people.  The Devils fans started it, by the way. 
[00:15:30]  They did.  If you look at my timeline, I never said anything bad about the Devils.  I was commenting on the game, and all I did was, I was like, wow, that's a costly fucking penalty.  A costly fucking penalty that they got, and the Kings were able to score twice very quickly  while they were, the Devils were on power play.  And it was, that's all I said.  And then some guy's like, fuck you.  Fuck your mother's tried cunt. 
[00:16:00]  I was like, oh, really?  Okay.  Now I'll fucking start bashing you about the Devils.  And then the other Devil fans jumped in.  But I never had a hard-on against the Devils about this game.  I could give a shit.  I mean, the Devils never had a chance in this series.  I hope they realize that.  The LA Kings were a much better team this year.  When they won two games.  I know the Devils beat the Kings in the regular season, so shut the fuck up.  But in general, the Kings were a way better hockey team.  Yeah.  Last night, it was just, it was a complete thrashing. 
[00:16:30]  They were outmatched, amazingly.  And then one of them was going like, shut up, Anthony.  You don't know shit about hockey anyway.  And I'm like, well, I think I know when the score is three zip in the first, it's not good.  Not good.  I don't have to be a fucking pro at hockey knowledge to know that that's bad.  You know, I like my hockey, and I love seeing that Stanley Cup hoisted.  Yeah.  I went to bed, because the game was a blowout. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  How was that?  Was it cool to see?  Oh, you know, they hoist it up.  They kiss it.  They skate around.  They all put their mouths on it.  Tears in their eyes, I guess.  Yeah, they were very emotional.  See, I don't have to stay up for this when you can see it right now.  They're very happy.  That's kind of cool.  And the crowd was very happy.  It's always cool.  Is that their first one?  Yeah, the Kings never won a Stanley Cup before.  And another highlight, by the way, was the lovely porn star Taylor Stevens. 
[00:17:30]  She's been behind the bench for a few games now.  Behind the bench, and whenever they would show, which side was it?  I guess it was the Devils coach.  Wow.  You'd just see her giant tits.  There was a viral video, pretty much, where the coach was staring at her tits instead of watching her play on the ice.  Who's banging her?  Who's banging her?  Oh.  Someone's got to be getting her tickets.  Yeah?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know how she would.  There's only one game she went to, or no?  I don't know.  A couple of games. 
[00:18:00]  She went to at least two.  And she was right behind the Devil's bench with her big, huge tits.  She's banging her playing.  Tits.  I'm guessing.  And she was tweeting about it.  Yeah.  Everyone's tweeting.  Do you see me?  Yeah.  Do you see me behind the bench?  We see you.  You're a quick cut MVP, huh?  It's my honor to present the Stanley Cup to Captain Dustin Brown.  Yeah, Dustin Brown is an animal.  Do they like him?  Oh, fuck.  He's an animal.  No-tooth motherfucker. 
[00:18:30]  Most of these guys don't have teeth.  No.  Pop him in after the game.  There it is.  Can you imagine taking a hockey puck to your front teeth?  Oh.  It's going to hurt.  It just knocks him out instantly.  Ow.  Not even a question that you lost the teeth.  There he goes.  There it is.  The big voice.  Yeah.  Wow.  That never gets old.  That's fucking cool.  There it goes.  Bullshit.  As far as sports go, that's pretty cool.  It is pretty fucking cool.  I must say.  I'm sure if Devil's fans wish to, you know, it was the Devil's. 
[00:19:00]  But, no.  Not to be.  They have nothing to be ashamed of.  You know, they had a good year.  They played the game.  They came to play.  Always sucks when your team comes in second.  It's the worst feeling ever.  I wouldn't even know that feeling, by the way.  I think I would take second place.  Yeah.  At this point.  Yeah.  So you stayed up for the whole game.  Yeah.  I was up.  Yeah.  I was tweeting. 
[00:19:30]  And watching the game and the celebration.  You were also watching a video from Buffalo, I heard.  Yes, yes.  I watched a wonderful.  This one's getting some popularity.  It's some guy from a part of Buffalo, I guess.  What is it?  South Buffalo?  Yeah.  That is commenting on a story.  I gather there was some kind of fire.  It seems to me, without knowing the entire story, that black people wanted to move into 
[00:20:00]  his neighborhood.  Okay.  And something burned.  I don't know what it was.  Wow.  They burned a house down?  And now they got this news guy interviewing this gentleman.  Wait.  Why are you being vague?  I don't know.  What did they burn down?  I honestly don't know.  I just know there was a fire.  It could have been anything.  Did they burn his house down?  No.  No.  A black guy's house down?  I don't know.  I didn't get enough info on the story itself.  But this good gentleman is talking to a news guy, and his opinion is that blacks should 
[00:20:30]  stay where they are, and whites stay where they are, and if they don't cross paths in their  neighborhoods, that shit like this won't happen, he says.  Oh, let's see him.  And the newscaster is worse than what this guy is saying.  And by the way, this guy is just voicing his opinion, and if you listen, he says,  they've destroyed their neighborhood, he doesn't want them moving into his neighborhood and  destroying his neighborhood.  And the newscaster is so, like he diffused the newscaster so quickly that the newscaster 
[00:21:00]  doesn't even know what to do.  Because he's used to people edging around the whole thing and not really getting to the  point, and they keep pounding with questions, trying to get the guy to say something offensive.  This guy just speaks his mind, and the newscaster just has to keep asking the same questions.  Really?  Yeah, because he's already said it.  He's very calm, this guy.  He's just speaking his piece.  Okay, let's listen to this. 
[00:21:30]  So tell me, you lived here for 30-something years.  They're classifying this fire as a potential hate crime.  What do you think about that?  I think that if people just stayed on their own side of town, their own neighborhood,  that things like that wouldn't happen.  Tell me what you mean by that.  Well, every race and color has their own section of Buffalo almost, so if they just stay on  their own side, things like this wouldn't happen.  People in these neighborhoods don't want those type of people moving down here and ruining  the property value and destroying the neighborhood.  So when things like that happen, it shouldn't be such a shock. 
[00:22:00]  What do you mean by those types of people?  Minorities.  African Americans.  So are you suggesting that they should stay on the east side rather than coming here to  South Buffalo?  Well, they've already wrecked the east side.  Why should they come down to the south side and wreck that neighborhood?  Do you think that by saying this guy's a calm guy, this racist, but you can see his face.  He's a problem. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah, he's a problem.  He may or may not be a firebug, but he's a problem.  He's wearing a wife beater, a black wife beater, and he looks like he could absolutely be in  an ultimate fighting ring.  Is this a young reporter, though?  This doesn't sound like TV news.  It sounds like a local.  Oh, it's Buffalo.  It's Channel 4.  Yeah, but where are they going to get up in Buffalo?  Yeah, that's true.  Probably a fresh-faced kid out of college, out of broadcasting school.  Just going, I don't know how to handle this guy.  I know.  Well, he might beat me up. 
[00:23:00]  He's actually saying the things I'm supposed to be trying to get out of him.  He's never heard anything like that.  Usually, you only get implications.  Well, two parts of town.  What do you mean by that?  But he's like, no, no, no.  They should stay there.  The minorities don't come there.  I got to say, I like this guy's honesty.  Yeah.  I appreciate his honesty.  This guy has a feeling about something, an opinion.  He lives in a neighborhood that he doesn't want destroyed.  He's got an opinion of other neighborhoods, right, wrong, or indifferent.  And he's speaking his piece.  He's not afraid.  I like that.  This is why I love Anthony.  And I mean love. 
[00:23:30]  Because Anthony said I admire his honesty.  Not, you know what, he's a racist and an ass, and he's just telling the truth.  It's, I like his honesty.  And then you validate his point.  Well, you know, property value description.  And he gets excited when he sees people like himself.  Oh, I like this.  He's like, see, I'm not alone.  That's good.  With my thoughts.  Is that YouTube or a mirror?  He's in really good shape.  It's YouTube.  Oh, okay.  This guy couldn't be more confident about what he's saying.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, all right, what else you got? 
[00:24:00]  He loves it.  Go back slightly there, Sam, please.  And let's continue with the clip from Buffalo.  Go to the south side and wreck that neighborhood.  Do you think that by saying these things, people on the other side of the city get offended?  Do you think that there's some sort of a bias, potentially?  A lot of people feel this way.  They just won't say it.  But you are. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Why are you coming out and saying these things?  Because I own a home and I see what happens when they move into the neighborhood.  Property value goes down.  Kids on the corner.  Crime goes up.  The east side used to be a beautiful place.  Look what they did to that.  Do you think that there's an issue, though, in what you're saying?  Well, I'm sure there is.  But, I mean, you've got to take a look at why it's an issue.  What do you mean by that?  I mean, they just ruin neighborhoods.  Uh, I guess what I'm getting at is that you're... 
[00:25:00]  Oh, this guy's great.  He totally threw this guy.  He's so scary, though.  You see the look he gave?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but this guy's not used to having an honest discussion and unapologizing.  Right.  I mean...  I...  Because the guy's going...  They ruin neighborhoods.  And if he's telling you how he feels, it's unpleasant.  But he's not being dirty.  No.  He's not expounding enough for the reporter.  Because the reporter keeps having to jump in.  Yes.  Because the guy is just a soft-spoken guy. 
[00:25:30]  Just...  And he says it, and then he's quiet.  He's not going off on this diatribe about, you know, using a racist language or anything.  He just speaks his mind, stops, and the reporter's got to keep asking stuff.  He doesn't know what the fuck to ask.  He's never talked to a guy like this.  No.  Go back a little so we can hear him go...  I guess what I'm getting at is that you're generalizing tremendously.  These people might have just been here looking for a different way of life, 
[00:26:00]  a better way of life.  Maybe the people are afraid what...  After you let one family in, then they...  More of them come in.  You know?  That's just how it is around her.  All right.  Do you think there's anything wrong with what you're saying?  I don't feel there's anything wrong with it.  A lot of people would feel wrong about it, but I don't.  That guy is amazing, isn't he?  He rules.  And he's a big, like, motherfucker with one of those heads that you know you could punch  right in the face and he wouldn't go anywhere. 
[00:26:30]  For anyone who wants a visual, if you've seen Once Were Warriors, he looks like Jake the  Mus.  Really?  He looks like Jake, yeah, the lead for Once Were Warriors, in the face.  And he has this way to raising his eyebrows.  He's confrontational, but softly.  Like, he's comfortable telling you exactly this.  He's one of those guys you could punch as hard as you could right in the jaw, and he'd  do that thing where he just takes his finger, wipes the blood, looks at it, and just smiles  at you.  Like, that's all you got?  Yeah.  All right.  My turn.  It's on the Facebook page, E-Rock. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  All right.  All this visual shit.  Go to our Facebook page, Hoping Anthony.  Yeah.  So, I got that.  And remarkably enough, you'd be amazed what side I was looking at when I found that video.  Sure.  Which was, of course, prominently linked on one of their threads.  Did they like him?  Oh, they loved him.  How did they love him?  I was trolling for some hate last night.  There you go.  I was trolling for some hatred, and I found some. 
[00:27:30]  I also found a video on YouTube.  What is it called?  Like, Hood something.  Hood Stories.  Hood something.  I tweeted it.  It was like one of my last tweets last night.  It's a little kind of a gonzo camera version of a documentary on Hood Life.  Hood Life.  This shit was infuriating.  What is this?  An actual documentary?  It's some kind of documentary on blacks in Palm Beach. 
[00:28:00]  And it's nothing but guns, fighting, shooting, drugs, money, fucking, and the N-bomb dropped  800 times.  That's a tough situation.  Infuriating to watch because they're just beating up white people.  110 rounds at a nigga's ass, nigga.  Act like you know what time it is, baby.  Putting it down for their Hood Life, volume three, nigga. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, my God.  These people are frightening.  I like the song, though.  And they're just showing a montage of people fighting, beating the piss out of each other,  shooting guns.  These crazy motherfuckers. 
[00:29:00]  That's a scary life.  Just crazy.  Go forward a little and you'll see some other shit.  Fight without it.  Down here, my nigga.  Bring your ass down here, my nigga.  We're going to show you how it is, my nigga.  Back on there, man.  Back on there, man.  Oh, yeah.  It's real out here.  I ain't even got to tell a nigga about downtown.  Half these niggas around here.  Scared to even ride up and through this motherfucker.  You feel me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not fake.  This is real, boy.  Fuck, no.  Fuck, no.  Fuck, no.  Fuck, no. 
[00:29:30]  It's just brutal.  Jerry from Palm Beach, you want me to like, you puss-ass, nigga?  No.  That kid was like five.  You better get it, nigga.  Fuck, nigga.  Nigga, out your head first.  Let niggas know we're going to give you a puss-ass to blue.  If a nigga cross that borderline or sit, it's cold.  Go give a nigga ass to blue.  Slump city, how we going to leave it right now?  Can you imagine wandering into this neighborhood by accident, Jim, with your Kango hat on?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, y'all?  We got a D-Rod's better.  Come on.  What?  We dumping eggs on the motherfucking in with that. 
[00:30:00]  We got a little to one-five, man.  Fuck, you lie.  You, your man, man.  You show us, man.  I don't know what he said.  Go back a little bit, Sam.  I know what he said.  I don't know what that gentleman said.  Oh, this is a long documentary.  Oh, it's an hour and 15.  Yeah, yeah.  He said something about shorties.  No, it's too far back.  Shorties.  Was it about shorties?  Yeah.  Hmm.  No, we're going to give you a pussy out of the blue.  If a nigga cross that borderline and sits cold, we're going to give a nigga ass the blue.  A slump city, how we going to leave it right there?  We got 15 rounds of better. 
[00:30:30]  That's what you call the baby chopper, boy.  We dumping eggs on the motherfucking nigga that beat.  One-five.  We got a little to one-five.  Fuck you, lie.  You, your mammy, and your shorty, nigga.  Fuck you, something.  You, your mammy, and your shorty, nigga.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  You, your mammy, and your shorty.  Very good, Jimmy.  Now, E-Rock was born and raised in Florida.  Do you know this neighborhood there, E-Rock?  No, because this is California.  What?  That makes more sense.  Palm Beach, California.  Orange County, yeah.  That sounds more. 
[00:31:00]  I'm like, how is this going down in West Palm Beach, Florida?  That sounds like California.  Did you say Florida in?  No, we said Palm Beach, and then they said Orange County.  I know Palm Beach, Florida.  I actually thought it was Florida.  See, we thought it was Florida.  See?  Mr. Florida.  What up, yo?  Huh?  Man.  Yo, that big, fat motherfucker come on through here with his big wrestling-ass shirt.  We're going to slap your big, fat motherfucking pelican neck.  So it says Palm Beach, Africa.  Jesus.  That's so bad. 
[00:31:30]  That's scary shit.  How big of an area is that?  Um, I don't know.  No, but, but I don't want to be there.  Ever.  I'll tell you that fucking much.  This just is a whole lifestyle I just don't get.  I don't understand it.  I told you, I wanted to do something where I told you, Anthony does all these things with  black people.  Yeah?  They would love you.  Would they?  You don't understand.  You're, you're, you're not a violent guy, but you're a funny guy and you love guns. 
[00:32:00]  Guys in this neighborhood, when they initially got over the shock of just seeing your fucking  skin and how fucking close it was in color to theirs, they would love you.  Cause you're a funny guy though.  You're a really funny guy and that would eventually, uh, and you're honest guy.  I'm telling you, see, but you don't know how much these guys would actually enjoy you.  But here's the deal.  I see a lot of white people in this documentary.  I watched it.  I watched the whole thing last night getting, um, a blind side punched in the side of the  face. 
[00:32:30]  Uh, and then, um, literally 10 of them will come over and start kicking, kicking, uh,  and stomping on the person that's on the ground.  That one person blindsided and threw down.  And there's this white guy just laying on the ground getting stomped.  I saw one clip.  They played it in slow motion, but this guy fell down.  He was punched, uh, next to a tree.  Two black guys run in slow motion, grabbed a branch of the tree.  How do you run in slow motion?  Swung on it.  I guess the film was done in slow motion. 
[00:33:00]  Swung from the branch and then let go and stomped on the guy.  And I swear, I was just like, I won't say it.  This is what you watch before you go to sleep.  Yes.  And it was exactly before I went to sleep.  Why do you do this to yourself?  I, I just, no, you have to keep, um, you know, this is a highlight reel though.  You got to keep up on things.  This would be exhausting.  If this was actual life, it is life. 
[00:33:30]  It's with life.  This is, this is a highlight reel.  What do you think?  They go to IBM when they're off.  This is a highlight reel.  This is every day for these motherfuckers.  Every day.  Every day.  It would seem exhausting if it was every day.  It is.  That's a rough way.  This is their life.  Every fucking day.  This ain't no fucking, they don't go to work.  Wiping his face.  Sweat off his face.  A hundred, hundred dollar bill. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, this is a fat line record.  You hear me?  Fat line.  You're going to have a vacay.  Big.  We're going to do it big.  Oh man.  That guy's frightening.  Holy shit.  How do you make your fingers do that?  I don't know.  Gang signs.  How do you do that?  Throwing up some gang signs.  Have you ever tried to do that shit?  How do you?  I can't throw up no gang signs, yo.  You got to break some tendons so they move like that?  Oh shit.  Is that how he did it?  Fight, fight.  Two of them.  Jesus.  Someone's saying it's totally Florida. 
[00:34:30]  Iraq.  Where's Palm Beach County?  Where's Palm Beach County?  They didn't say Palm Beach County.  They said Orange County.  They just said Palm Beach County.  It's actually Palm Beach and West Palm.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, yeah.  Iraq, I think is a...  Iraq's a dummy.  Everyone's calling you a dummy.  Good.  I mean, everybody.  It sounds California.  It is the FLA, yo.  They just said...  Palm Beach County.  Palm Beach County.  So where's that?  Iraq is...  Well, let the people talk.  Yes, let the people talk.  Someone's got an opinion.  Michelle in Florida. 
[00:35:00]  Yo, it's absolutely South Florida.  Orange County is Orlando, first of all.  And it says Hallandale and all these places.  Iraq is retarded.  It is absolutely South Florida.  What part of South Florida?  Orlando is Central Florida.  And Orange County is also in California.  Oh, shit.  But if you listen...  Palm Beach is also California.  You would hear that it is Hallandale and all places in South Florida.  I've never heard of a Palm Beach, California, to tell you the truth.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Let me ask Michelle.  Where is this in South Florida?  It's just north of Broward County.  So it's...  No, you've got to give us white towns.  I don't know this shit.  Like, is it close to...  I don't know.  We know Miami is white people.  Where is it?  There's an Orange County in New York, people are saying, too, which there is.  Yeah.  No, you rock.  There's no Palm Beach county.  I mean, it's in South Florida.  But what...  Near where we...  How far from Miami?  Yeah.  It's like two hours from Miami.  Okay.  Hour and a half, two hours from Miami. 
[00:36:00]  North of Miami.  How far from Farc-Lardadel?  So that's not really South, is it?  Central.  Isn't it more Central?  But anyways, it's definitely...  Is it near Tampa?  Is it near Orlando?  Is it near Daytona Beach?  Farc-Lardadel.  And north of Miami.  Wait, what?  It's like right between Orlando and Miami.  Okay.  All right.  So...  That's over 300 miles.  Don't make it...  Don't start getting mad at other people telling you the actual thing.  You were off by 3,000.  At least you're only off by...  I'm not from there.  I'm not from there.  Don't do this new mapping system. 
[00:36:30]  Dumb-dumb.  You were born and raised in Florida.  You would think you would know something about Florida.  He's retarded.  Yeah.  He's retarded.  He's not from there, dumb bitch.  Whoa.  What happened now?  He called her a dumb bitch.  Nah, Michelle.  Y-Rack called you a dumb bitch.  Y-Rack is hoodlum.  Yeah, he really is.  Would you like to retort?  No.  Absolutely not.  He's retarded.  He's wrong.  I'm right.  That's all right.  Yo, get a Coke float, motherfucker. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Yo, Coke floats.  Yo, gotta make some fucking fantasy wrestling lineups and shit, man.  Shit.  This is just a highlight reel.  I know.  I'll fix you.  I'll punch it now.  I'm at work.  Talk to you later.  This is a highlight reel of shit going down.  But it's their...  No, but it's their life.  Let's go to Jay in Cleveland.  Jay.  Life.  They got some downtime?  Jay.  No.  They got some downtime.  Matt, these motherfuckers are gangsters.  They're not rubbing...  100% motherfucker.  They're not rubbing hundreds on their face all day long.  They got downtime.  What do you think their downtime looks like?  Community service?  I don't know.  Maybe they play a video game or something. 
[00:37:30]  No, they're fucking gangsters.  There's some downtime.  Maybe they go to the beach for the day.  24-7 gangsters, yo.  24-7.  They always got their chopper.  They're fighting tree limbs to fucking jump on and stop people.  At night when they go out, it's fucking about fighting.  They got some downtime, man.  And fucking bitches and drugs.  They're dealing drugs.  Ah, shit.  Let me go to Jay in Cleveland.  What's happening there?  That's a fight.  Sam, please.  So you're telling me this happens all day long or is there downtime in between these flash  mobs?  You can't flash mob all day long.  You'd be exhausted.  What up, yo? 
[00:38:00]  Jay, what do you got, buddy?  Sam.  Yeah.  That's a minority in the black community.  Oh, is it?  That's a minority of the population.  We look at those niggas just as, hey, but how many things would you do?  All right.  Could I ask you something, then?  It's a minority of the black community, okay?  I got you.  I got you.  Do you agree with that?  I don't know.  Oh, come on.  You got to agree with that, at least.  I don't have the fucking stats and numbers here.  I don't know.  But let me tell you something.  How about then there should be a minority of the white community doing this that is actually 
[00:38:30]  a bigger number than the minority of the black community just for the fact that we  have more people in the country?  Find me some fucking mob shots of fucking white people beating the piss out of black  people, waving guns around.  Well, they do exist, but they're black and white.  Huh?  They do exist, but they're in black and white.  Oh, are they?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's true.  Yo, yo, yo, go.  What?  What up, yo?  We don't... 
[00:39:00]  It's not as many black people doing this.  No?  We look at them as just as ignorant as you do.  All right.  We don't show them this.  Why are there so many?  There's a lot of hardworking black people out there.  I live in a complete black community.  I'm not saying there's not, dude.  I've said that a million times on this fucking show.  People don't hear me, but what I'm saying is, why does this exist anyway?  Why does this element exist?  For the same reason when you played that Buffalo clip, that that person exists. 
[00:39:30]  That person exists because he doesn't want his neighborhood destroyed.  What's the problem?  And he's also, dude, you gotta see he's also talking calmly, and he wasn't engaging in violence.  He was just expressing his opinion.  He's expressing his opinion.  Don't blame that fucking guy for the fact that these motherfuckers are killing each other.  Jesus Christ, another 10 people dead in Chicago, and the mayor's on fucking Conan playing games? 
[00:40:00]  Well, what happens?  It's a war zone in Chicago for the motherfuckers.  They have the Chicago Marathon?  10 people died?  I guess so.  Must have been.  Exhaustion?  Yeah.  It must have been a spelling bee, and their brains exploded.  I'm with Jay.  It's obviously a minority.  How is it obviously a minority?  Show me numbers, motherfucker.  Because this looks exhausting.  Show me fucking numbers.  This looks exhausting if it was happening all the time.  Hold on.  Stop yelling for a second.  All right.  For me to lump you in with your thoughts. 
[00:40:30]  I've been listening to the show for years.  For me to lump you in with your thoughts as a Klansman is like for you to lump me in  with the thoughts of those niggas with those gold teeth.  All right.  Let me give you some knowledge.  And I know you're not.  Hit him with some knowledge.  I know there's numbers.  Let me give you some knowledge, motherfucker.  You could lump me in with white people.  Because to tell you the truth, a lot of white people think the same way.  Like that other gentleman said, they're just afraid to fucking talk in this day and age 
[00:41:00]  because the racist label comes flying out.  Even if you talk about these thugs.  If I fucking talk about these thugs in too poor a light, or if I use certain words to  describe these thugs, which describes them perfectly, I get fucking crucified.  You could say rambunctious.  Oh, smart.  I watched the first 48, and I think it's some of the saddest shit ever.  I do.  I'll look at it like, why are we doing this to each other? 
[00:41:30]  What happened in Auburn with the two football players getting shot?  It's absolutely horrible.  It's absolutely horrible.  It's something someone needs to be talking about.  I'm glad that you're actually saying it because no black leaders are saying it.  I'm glad you're saying it.  No, they never will.  And every time you tweet something about it, I'll retweet it too.  No one's going to listen to me, though, because I'm a racist, see?  Because I...  People are listening to you, and I'm glad you're saying it.  Oh, wow.  Chick's fighting, man. 
[00:42:00]  That rules every time.  I'm a racist.  Listen, I've got to move on because there's too many people, Jay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going to Jason Orlando, who knows a little bit more about this neighborhood.  By the way, pause.  The guy has a Florida tattoo on his neck.  Yeah.  Nice.  There's a Florida tattoo.  It's easy to go in and get a job like that.  He likes Florida.  No, no.  It's difficult.  Oh.  Jason, what's going on?  It's Florida.  Hey, you've got to realize, I agree a little bit with that Cleveland guy.  It is a different type of minority, but they're all Haitian.  So that's why Jimmy gets a little bit of credit there for deciphering what they were saying. 
[00:42:30]  But it's a huge Haitian community, and they ain't doing nothing but flash mobs.  That's all they do all day.  Interesting.  And they're in the Palm Beach County.  I have no idea.  Haitians are scary, huh?  I just see a bunch of fucking thugs that have no, that have contribute nothing to a civilized  fucking society and should just be eliminated.  The funniest part about that, they say Hallandale, that's the biggest Jewish community down there. 
[00:43:00]  Boy.  I don't know what the hell they're repping over there in Hallandale, but...  They're repping.  They're repping up in Hallandale.  How do you get all those gold teeth?  Does that hurt by jacking a motherfucker or by dealing drugs?  Dealing the drugs.  I think that's actually kind of like the teardrops.  The gold teeth is for killing people.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I just finished it up.  Jesus.  All right.  And big rams.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Have a good one. 
[00:43:30]  Amazing.  Here we go.  Let's say hi to Graham in Pennsylvania.  Graham.  Hey, what's going on, gentlemen?  Yeah, Anthony, you wanted to know where all the white versions of these crazy guys in  Florida are during every other trailer park across America.  Yeah.  Cooking up mess and...  Well, show me some videos.  Show me some fucking videos.  Show me these...  Maybe the media's got something to do with that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It can't be blamed.  No one wants to accept fucking blame for their own goddamn fucking behavior. 
[00:44:00]  No one wants to accept blame.  What the fuck?  Every guy that calls, every black guy that calls, has to have some fucking problem.  It's the media.  It's white people.  This guy's fucking, you know, the trailer parks and stuff.  How about you just say, yeah, there's some fucking despicable son of a bitches out there,  and it really looks bad upon your community.  Fuck.  I agree with that.  I'm just saying, you're always saying that the media tries to baby black people. 
[00:44:30]  Maybe they're doing the same thing with crazy white folks.  No, they would love to show a fucking mob of white people beating the fuck out of black people  and shooting guns in the air and talking how they're fucking, they're jacking black people.  It's just, it's so one-sided.  Ugh.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Later on.  Palm Beach County, Florida.  Florida.  Oh, E-Rock.  Yeah, that's great.  I can't see it from in here, so I don't know.  Oh, E-Rock.  Sam, turn it so he can see it.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:45:00]  You watched it just as long as everyone was listening to it.  All right, Marsala Jelen.  See, it's Marsala and Magellan.  See?  So you sleep like a baby after you watch this shit?  Oh, because I was so revved up and mad that when I go to bed, I go like, ah, and I'm exhausted.  Why do you search out stuff to rev you up?  Well, I like keeping tabs on things.  And by the way, I found another site where some black guy is railing, just going off about how white people are very good at shooting. 
[00:45:30]  And how he sees these videos of these 12-year-old white girls hitting the bullseye.  And how these motherfucking niggas, they can't hit shit with the gun, motherfucker.  And when the war goes down, we're going to have to know how to shoot, motherfucker.  Why aren't you taking target practice?  And he's serious.  He's absolutely fucking serious. 
[00:46:00]  Talking about, he's very angry that white people are able to hit their targets.  And that angers you instead of makes you laugh?  No, I was cracking up at that.  I would laugh at a video like that.  I was cracking up at that.  I get angry when I see mobs of black guys beating the fuck out of white people for no reason,  except the fact that they were walking down the street.  And they just, I hate the blindside fights.  I hate those fucking, the second a guy goes down, five guys at least are on top of him,  just beating the fuck out of him, laughing, going through the pockets, robbing him. 
[00:46:30]  And it's with impunity.  None of these motherfuckers ever get caught because no one talks.  No one cares.  And it's not treated like a real crime.  It's treated like, oh, there was a fight or something.  No, it's assault and fucking robbery.  Sherry, you want to talk to a black woman who agrees with you?  Oh, shit.  Let's go to Sherry in North Carolina.  Sherry.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, it's actually Sherry.  Sherry.  Oh.  Do you spell that shit all weird? 
[00:47:00]  Well, my mama's different.  But anyway.  Wait, how do you spell it?  I got to know.  I love, I love the spelling sometimes.  H-E-R-I-S-S-E.  S-S-E?  Yes, two S's, as in Sam.  Wait, spell it again.  C-H-E-R-I-S-S-E.  All right.  That doesn't even make sense.  Well, if you pronounce it.  But anyway.  All right, I'm sorry.  I almost agree with Ant. 
[00:47:30]  Almost.  People like this should definitely be lined up and eliminated.  You're never going to contribute anything to society.  You're just going to hurt my family, hurt my kids.  They're a burden.  White, white, red, or indifferent.  You should just definitely line dumbasses like this up and just shoot them in the head.  How about I'm fucking, how about I'm judging them on the content of their character?  How about that?  How about if they fucking, if I didn't even know what color they were, I would still hate these motherfuckers.  Well, in this case, yeah. 
[00:48:00]  If you're of any race and you act this stupid and this ignorant and you're hell-bent on glorifying death to this degree,  they should just line you up, do us all a favor, and take your ass out.  Yeah.  However, to the gentleman earlier that said something about it's how they portray us in the media.  Okay, a percentage of that may be true, but it's ultimately how we act in the media.  It's sad and unfortunate, and as a race, we do need to get it together. 
[00:48:30]  However, something you have to consider is that this type of mentality runs across every race.  There's a group of idiots in every race.  I don't care, be it big or small.  There's some dumbasses in every race, everywhere you go.  It's just unfortunate that these fools have access to camcorders and you too.  Yeah, I hear you, but you know something?  These boneheads that are in this race in particular happen to affect a lot of other people. 
[00:49:00]  I understand what you're saying.  There's other fucking idiots of all different races, all different races.  But you know what, it doesn't seem to directly affect as many people as this does.  And I mean physically and financially, and it's just a burden.  Do you think the West Palm Beach, Florida police department needs to fucking use this many resources  to just corral up fucking animals like this? 
[00:49:30]  It's crazy.  Why don't they behave?  Just behave.  I know, every time I talk, I feel like it's going to be another song.  You have to talk into that cadence.  Oh, yeah.  Look at West Palm Beach.  Florida.  Florida.  They're acting up.  You like have a second follow-up song.  The police have resources being expended.  Just want the same oomph to it?  No, it just doesn't.  It's the B-side.  It'll be the one-hit wonder trying to get that next song.  The B-side of fucking Too Shy Shy.  Let's say hi.  How are we doing, Cherise? 
[00:50:00]  Thank you, Cherise.  Thank you, Cherise.  Thank you, Cherise.  Cherise?  Yeah, thank you, Cherise.  Let's go to Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  What's going on, boys?  Hi, Tom.  What's up?  I don't know.  A lot of things are going on in Chicago, I guess.  MSNBC's up there today.  Conan was up there.  What's going on in Chicago that everyone's going to Chicago?  Hey, I work for a utility company, man.  Or just talk about what you want to do.  And we go into these neighborhoods.  This works so much better when I'm just walking the street.  I have a conversation with people. 
[00:50:30]  It's just all fucked up here.  It's just all fucked up here.  I got to tell you, I don't like when the spooks start roaming around the neighborhood out here in Chicago.  The Chicago PD just lets them do their thing, man.  Just lets them do their thing.  We had a few shootings here the other day.  You got it.  All right, punch it out.  All right, Tom.  You punch out.  Later.  Oh, my God.  I love the Chicago accent. 
[00:51:00]  That's hilarious.  It's creeping up very quickly on Boston as far as my favorite wacky accent.  Duh!  Yeah, that's the normal one everyone says is the Bears.  But there's so many things you could just say that sound funny when you talk like this.  It's great.  Yeah, so that was my night.  Wow, that's so weird.  You went really white to really black. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I was watching a hockey game.  Hockey's really white.  Yeah, in between periods, I was punching up some videos, having a little fun, reading  some stuff, watching videos, audio clips.  How many fantasies do you have?  How many daytime fantasies do you have about you're in a bad situation like that and they  misjudge you?  Like Anthony's daytime fantasies and they misjudge him.  Oh, no.  I'm like Charles Bronson.  Yeah, when they're like, you know, yo, man, you went to Escalade.  And you're like, what?  Excuse me?  Huh?  What?  What? 
[00:52:00]  I used to.  I'll tell you that something.  And you pulled his shirt back a little bit.  What?  Oh, all right, man.  I'll be completely honest with you.  I used to think that.  Now all I think is that I would absolutely be railroaded and put in jail no matter what the  situation was because I would just be fucked.  You can't defend yourself anymore in this country, never mind New York State.  So those fantasies go out the window when reality dips in and all of a sudden I go from  being Charles Bronson to some fucking schlep in a courtroom as the judge is pronouncing 
[00:52:30]  sentence on me because I pumped one into some fucking shithead.  Let's go to West Palm Beach.  This is Gary.  Florida?  Yes, we're going to Florida.  Yeah, hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Gary.  I just want to tell you, I watched that video, but I could tell you, I've seen my alleyway  in that video there.  Oh, nice.  Is that California or Florida?  It's definitely West Palm Beach, Florida.  Oh, E-Roc said it was California.  Well, now people are saying it's West Palm Beach. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, that's definitely West Palm Beach.  I live right across the street.  I'm actually looking at it now at the police department.  And I'm on Clematis, which is like the main strip of downtown.  But the minute I go one block over, it's a totally different world.  Do they bother you when you go to the other block over?  Yeah, actually, I've biked for the past 20 years.  And when I bike through that area, pretty much all the time, I wouldn't say all the time,  but half the time, somebody's going to be like, hey, man, give me a ride.  Give me a ride.  Give me a ride. 
[00:53:30]  See, I've seen people run, too.  No, I've seen them run and throw their bodies against a bike and just fucking smash people  on the ground and take their bike.  Wait, wait, let me ask you, Gary.  You've been going through these neighborhoods for how many years?  I guess I moved down here since 92.  And when I first...  Hold on.  I'm going somewhere with this.  And how white are you?  Italian, German.  And since 92, what's the worst thing that has happened to you going through these neighborhoods?  Um, the worst thing that's happened to me, um, I'd say three times that a van will pull 
[00:54:00]  up to the side, a white van, and guys will jump out and start running after us.  And then one time, a gun was pulled, and my friend, uh, he even got off his bike and ran,  so he lost his bike totally.  I rest my case, Your Honor.  What?  Nothing has happened to the guy.  Why?  He said...  That's just basic shit.  Been menaced by guys with guns.  Since 92, that's the worst that has happened to him, and he goes through the neighborhood a lot?  Yeah, we still have...  That's along the actual waterfront itself.  And even back then, it used to be... 
[00:54:30]  Even though we're pretty gentrified now, the downtown West Palm, there used to be a time  when just me being where I am now, the cops would actually stop me and be like, why are  you here in this area?  And this guy's fucking...  He's aware of the situation.  He's, you know, he knows...  But he hasn't been sucker-ponsted, or he hasn't been pushed off his bike.  Because he's aware.  He's aware.  You just walk down that street with those motherfuckers.  You walk down the street with those motherfuckers, and you tell me how things panned out for  you.  That's a highlight reel, sir.  It's also...  It tells me that's those guys' lives. 
[00:55:00]  That's how they live their lives.  It's a highlight reel.  They're not going to school after that.  The West Palm Beach...  Oh, no, I agree with you there.  In that kind...  Not in maybe that neighborhood.  Sir, how far is the improv in that neighborhood?  Because that's...  You said gentrification.  They've cleaned out a certain area and made the improv in that whole little city  school.  Yeah, that's city place.  I went down there and seen you.  I'm two blocks from there, and we're on the lettered streets, but the minute you get  to the numbered streets, that's when it's the different world.  And it's kind of an interesting story of what actually started, because we have actually 
[00:55:30]  one of the worst, I guess, ghettos of America.  But the interesting story is what started this particular ghetto, and those guys that you  see most of them are descendants of an area called the Styx, which is on the island of  Palm Beach, when Flagler first started the island, they built the train stations, and  they said they could have half of the island, the African-Americans that built the trains.  But then right after they built the trains and all the estates in Palm Beach, they realized,  oh my gosh, we want this island all for ourselves. 
[00:56:00]  So there was a Christmas party in the early 1900s where they invited them all to come to  the Christmas party, and then they burned down all of their houses, which were wooden  at the time, and then that's when they came over the bridge here, and then that's where  most of the descendants are.  All right, look, some mistakes were made.  Wait, who burned down whose house?  The blacks got their houses burned down?  Yeah, by the whites, actually, because all the blacks had just the wooden shacks there.  There's still a few remaining, but a lot of them, downtown West Palm Beach, are actually  the descendants of the people who built the train stations and the island of Palm Beach. 
[00:56:30]  See, honestly, dude, there is, in a way, no excuse for what goes on, but in a way, we,  in a lot of ways, as a nation, not you and I, brought this on ourselves by fucking being  shitty.  We're paying for the shit people did.  Yeah, 100 years ago.  And 50 years ago, even.  Not even 100 years ago.  You know what?  You know what?  Fucking move on!  I agree, but it's one of those things where this whole fucking downhill thing started so 
[00:57:00]  many years ago, and like, when you go back to the 60s, I don't know, it's 50 years ago  now, but you see the footage, you don't see, and you have to say, you don't see white people  fighting to go to college and having the entire infrastructure fighting them.  Like, these are a bunch of thugs, but you don't see fucking white kids trying to get  into a building and a genuine, like, a societal infrastructure going, no.  It's like, it...  But you don't see that anymore.  No, no, I know, but it started a really awful process, and right now, this is what we get. 
[00:57:30]  And it will eventually change, but this is part of the fucking bullshit.  I don't see it eventually changing.  I think it will.  I don't.  There's an inherent problem that has to be dealt with in some way, shape, or form,  and I don't think just time is going to fucking fix this shit.  How come it's not out of herent?  Oh.  Oh, double guns, baby.  Oh, exactly.  What's that?  Out of herent.  No, but I was doing double guns, because I'm from West Palm.  Jesus.  How about West Elbow or something? 
[00:58:00]  I'm fucking killing.  I wish you were killed.  So that's what destroys the family structure, and that's what gets a woman that has fucking  five kids and doesn't know the father of any of them, and they grow up with their  fucking grandmother because the mother then ends up in prison or something.  Like, that whole issue, that's because a hundred years ago some houses were burnt down?  No, no, no, no.  But it starts a whole fucking, it just starts a whole weird thing for people. 
[00:58:30]  It's like when there's nowhere to build from, that's where America fucked up.  And I'm not saying it wouldn't still be like this in certain neighborhoods, but we can't  sit there and wonder, why is it like that?  When years ago, blacks were fighting to get into college, and we're told, no, you can't.  It's like, and for a long time, it's like, now we look at it like, ah, so many years ago,  so many years ago.  But in that time, they were as alive as you and I are, and they were saying the same thing.  Ah, the fucking niggers want to read.  Like, back then it was just a different thing. 
[00:59:00]  I understand your point, but now, what we're doing now, if people could get together, like  they get together to blame other people for their fucking plight, and got together and  actually maybe cleaned up their neighborhood, got together and figured out how to make businesses  for yourselves instead of having agents come in and run every store in your neighborhood,  things like that, perhaps if the energy was put there, there'd be a better outlook and 
[00:59:30]  a better conclusion.  Yeah, you're right.  But, I don't know.  I'm not saying it's, it's not their fault, I don't mean it like that.  I mean, just very realistically, when you look at, if America had a great history of that  stuff, like, and was really always fair, and this is what was happening, I would say literally  fucking kick them out of the country, but that's not what happened, and it's unfortunate  that, again, I've said it before, we are paying for, in a historical sense, recent mistakes. 
[01:00:00]  Like, in our lifetime, it's a long time ago.  It's our fifth year.  But in the historical country sense, when's the last time you read about, like, Alexander  the Great from 1850, can you, or 1002, can you differentiate between Alexander the Great  and 1002 and 1052, it's like, in a historical sense, it's all like that, you know, that  couple hundred year period.  In historical sense, we look at things in, like, two and three and four and five hundred  year blocks. 
[01:00:30]  So, how long is it going to be a viable excuse?  I don't know.  How long is it going to be the only fucking excuse that there is for this, if you want  to be a guy that makes excuses?  It's the only excuse.  We were fucking treated like shit, so now we don't know what the fuck to do, and we  act like children.  Perhaps 50 years?  Is it another 50 years?  Is it 100 years?  How long so I could set my cryogenic fucking chamber and wake up when it's over? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, no, I know.  And again, it's not an excuse.  It's not saying they're not responsible.  Of course they are.  Well, to Jimmy's point, Sal wants to say something.  Sal.  Sal.  I have a feeling Sal doesn't agree with me by the name.  Yeah, Sal.  You know, fucking Jimmy.  All right, sorry, Sal.  Go ahead, Sal.  Sal?  I don't see an arrow.  Hello?  Oh, Sal said, hey, we wouldn't let women vote, but they're not beating the shit out  of us.  That is true, but police also weren't burning down women's homes and weren't stomping  on women and beating women.  We kept the women down for a very long time, and they're not, you know, causing problems 
[01:01:30]  nowadays.  That is true.  That is Sal's point.  Although, the treatment of women was a little, women weren't slaves, and women weren't, you  know, the police beatings of women.  It just didn't happen the same way.  But, you know, I know what Sal's point is.  Well, Sal, call back.  I don't know if it was me or you, but make your point.  All right.  Man.  That's a hell of a night for yourself.  That said, it's an atrocious neighborhood.  That's exactly what I was doing. 
[01:02:00]  It was a really bad neighborhood, obviously.  But I don't think that it's, I don't think it's all white people's fault, either.  Like, oh, we did the, but it's like, the countries, I'm so irritated with America in  jail.  Like, I love this country.  But I'm so sick and tired of us telling everyone how to, the double standards here are  driving me fucking crazy.  And that, we've always had them.  And this is the result of one of them.  This is the result of one of the double standards.  This is what happens when, for a couple of hundred years, you treat people like dog shit. 
[01:02:30]  There's ugly repercussions that come out the other end.  Yeah, I guess it wipes the brain's ability to distinguish right from wrong, right out.  No.  When you treat them like shit.  They all of a sudden don't know what wrong is.  But you see how angry this is, just from our point of view?  Like, just watching this stuff is enraging.  Yes.  Put yourself in the position of having dealt with it.  You know, it'd be fucking...  Gotta educate the people.  No, I think it starts a culture of fucking self-defeat and defeatist thinking and fucking  like, ah, it just starts that. 
[01:03:00]  It's the fucking easy way.  It's so easy to grab a fucking gun, not go to school or work, grab some drugs, sell the  fucking shit, be part of a fucking gang so you feel like you're part of something.  Uh, uh, corrupt your fucking youngsters that are five, eight years old and make them throw  up gang signs and hold guns.  It's easier than fucking going to school, doing well, getting a job, whatever the fuck  you want to do.  Or not going to school, just getting a job, going every day, fuck it, whatever. 
[01:03:30]  Just, this seems to be the easiest fucking thing you can do and still breathe and live.  It's just, it's fucking infuriating.  It's lazy.  Part of it is, but part of it is, I don't know if I'd say certain parts are lazy, but I wouldn't  say a lot of this is lazy.  This is a hard, like even though you're dead by the time you're 25, I wouldn't say that  someone, they're all in great shape, these guys.  One thing they're not, it's lazy.  They're fighting.  Amazing.  But, uh, I would like to interview, I wish we could get like a couple of real thugs in 
[01:04:00]  here, like real guys like that.  You rock.  Just to talk to.  California.  Got any fucking interns?  I'd be interested in that.  Thugs.  Yeah.  Talk to some thugs.  But, like, a real interview, like, uh, honestly, if they would answer honestly, I'm curious about  it.  Because if you, if you grow up somewhere.  Can we interview them on the phone?  Yeah, maybe on the phone's better.  Yeah, maybe a phoner.  They're listening right now, I'm sure.  If everyone in your neighborhood is doing something.  Yeah.  If everyone, like, you know, like, even in, it's on a much smaller scale, like in Brooklyn, 
[01:04:30]  when there was, you know, when they'd beat blacks, they'd come through, it's, and again,  it's just because other people in the neighborhood were doing it.  Right.  If everyone in your neighborhood is in a gang, or, or fucking is broke.  Right.  And it has no air conditioning, and there's fucking roaches, and this guy has a brand new fucking,  uh, what do they drive?  Maximus.  And, and, uh, and is making $20,000 a week.  It's really hard to go, I'm going to buckle down and study when the schools aren't great  and everybody I know is doing this. 
[01:05:00]  Well, then it's, it's like I said, it's being fucking lazy.  Because if you look at that and think, oh, I could do the, the, the legitimate and hard  way to, to do this.  Here's something.  How come, uh, the only, we only get, uh, these half-assed shit leaders in the black community  and, and a few, you know, of the clergy that come out, uh, but for the most part, people  will get together, they'll march, they'll fucking, um, uh, uh, get on the news when they want 
[01:05:30]  to blame somebody for the plight of, of their people.  Yet, you never see that energy against gangs and against fucking, and I believe me, I've  seen marches against gangs and violence, but it really isn't with the same verve, uh,  that, that, they marched when they think injustice is being done.  I'll tell you why.  Same reason that every other American does stuff.  There's a double standard in the black community too.  Like they are, black people are much more likely to complain when it's a white cop doing 
[01:06:00]  something or a guy like Zimmerman than when it's other black people.  It's the same thing that every other, that our whole country does.  It's a double standard.  They, they practice, I'm not saying black people don't practice double standards or,  or don't behave fucking horribly, but.  Well, uniting against, uh, uh, whitey fucking you for hundreds of years is really not going  to do anything in this day and age.  You know, I guess it did well for the civil rights movement and, and it did, uh, get, 
[01:06:30]  uh, more, more rights, uh, for black people to, you know, to, to use this society and it's,  uh, full, to its full potential.  But, all right, look, you did it.  Congrats.  Now move on to another cause.  Stopping this fucking bullshit that's going on in the community and fucking, uh, you know,  maybe, maybe that 50% of, of, uh, the, the male, young male population being in prison.  How about you address that without blaming white people again? 
[01:07:00]  You know, it's hard to blame white people when, uh, maybe somebody is dealing drugs or  has a gun or something and they get thrown in prison.  Eh, those are the rules.  Sorry.  But it's also to, to answer your question about like, how come they make those decisions  and those shit, you're an adult.  Like if you, if you moved into a neighborhood at 18 or 15 even, and we're presented with  that choice, like, okay, you can be in this gang where everybody else is, or you can go  to school, even though you, you might be smart enough to make that decision and go, you know  what?  Fuck that.  That's the easy way.  I'm not going to wind up in prison.  But if you're, if you're fucking seven and eight and kids, when you're that young, none 
[01:07:30]  of us are fucking smart enough to go, I'm going to buck or very few of us, you know,  it's all your parents.  You're right.  And I was fucking, even, even from a horrible, uh, parental marriage that, that was going  on, I still got enough guidance to know not to do shit like that.  I was told, you know, you'll go, you'll go to fucking jail.  It's not, it's not good.  Uh, I, I, you know, my parents pretty much instilled in me right from wrong and shit like  that. 
[01:08:00]  So do the same fucking thing.  Take some responsibility for fuck's sake.  Yeah.  All right.  Take some responsibility for fuck's sake.  One more call.  This guy used to be in that, uh, life, uh, Rod in North Carolina.  Rod.  Rod.  Hello.  Hey guys.  Hi, Rod.  Yeah, I'm here.  Yeah, I understand what you guys are saying.  Yeah, absolutely right.  Uh, I lived in North Philadelphia all my life and my father was a crackhead.  My mom did what she could do to raise me.  Uh, I'll say about 18. 
[01:08:30]  I just got tired of my friends just dying left and right.  My family died left and right.  And it came to a point where it's just, just like you said, it's a point of discipline and  laziness.  You know, there's no structure in these streets.  There's no, there's no, there's no one to look up to.  Just like another caller said, there's no leader.  So these kids, you know, they're, they're living this life.  It's like, fuck it, I'm not going to bust my ass.  I'm not going to get a nine to five when exactly what you said, this guy right next to me has  got a fucking maximum for selling up, you know, all this coke and weed and shit, you  know, but it comes to a point of the individual, you know, if you, if you got enough sense in 
[01:09:00]  your fucking brain to know this ain't the life you want to live that eventually you're  going to end up in three spots.  Well, well, let me ask you, uh, how'd you get out of that life?  And was it easy?  No, no, absolutely.  It's not easy.  I, I, the way I got out was I decided, you know, I have a little girl on the way and I  said, you know what?  I can't live these streets.  I've been shot.  I've been stabbed.  Uh, you know, even, even by my own people and, and by cops beat down and everything like  that.  And this is all at the age of 16.  Wow.  And I realized, you know, this ain't the fucking life for me. 
[01:09:30]  You know, this ain't the way I want to raise my daughter.  I've, I've met most of my, most of my life I've been around Spanish and black, right?  Now I'm half black and I'm half Puerto Rican.  So I got a double mix right there.  But I've had a lot of friends to, to tell me, you know, how can you live like this and  do it every day?  It's not a real, this is actually how fucking these guys live.  And they do it just to put up this persona to be E-M or E, you know what I mean?  Yeah, no, we get all that, but I want to know how you got out. 
[01:10:00]  So all that happened at 16.  What was your move?  Did you leave the neighborhood?  What'd you do?  Well, what I, what I did was, uh, I just saved up from all the dumb shit that I did.  I know the things that I was doing was wrong.  I saved that money and I moved the fuck out.  I went about three hours away from the town.  I took my girl, I took my kid and I said, fuck it.  I work a factory job until I have to die.  There you go.  See?  Wayne got the CDL.  I started driving, got my own house.  I got my own, you know, my own property and everything like that.  But yet I still have family that are still in that fucking world. 
[01:10:30]  And I try to talk to them and tell them, look, you know, this life doesn't have to be this way.  The fucking road doesn't end a couple blocks away.  But it's just a point of no structure, no discipline.  There's no leadership.  These guys are fucking lazy.  They don't know any better.  So it's a pure ignorance type of thing.  Yes, absolutely.  Bravo, sir.  Bravo.  He's obviously a rarity, though.  It's just one of those buckle jerks.  You know what I mean?  The fucking thing doesn't end until someone actually steps up.  You got this fucking black president in the office that hasn't mentioned one fucking thing about the inner city, the youth and everything like that. 
[01:11:00]  But he's more fucking concerned about, you know, all this other shit that's going on in other parts of the world.  I mean, I just don't understand it.  It makes me sick.  You know, I'm a minority.  I'm an Hispanic.  I'm half black.  But yet the shit that I see just drives me nuts.  But nobody wants to say anything.  It's just like that guy.  I respect what that guy said about his neighborhood.  I understand that.  But at the same time, there's not the opposite side of that.  There's no one black saying, look, I'm tired of these type of persons coming in here, destroying his neighborhood. 
[01:11:30]  Let us educate them.  Let us know what to do.  But there's none of that.  Do you know, if a black person would have said the same shit that white guy said, no one would even look at the video.  It would have just been, oh, there's somebody that wants their community kept nice and doesn't want these thugs moving in and fucking shit up.  But since it's a white guy, then it's a racial incident and it's terrible.  You know, Rod and I have a lot in common.  Because, Rod, I wore a tango and I used to listen to rap music when I was a young man.  And I was able to make it out, luckily. 
[01:12:00]  Hey, who shot you?  Not by name, of course.  But, like, what was your relationship with that person?  It was just back in those days, man.  North Sully was the wild, wild west, man.  He was clowning, yo.  He'd be clowning.  North Sully was rough, man.  Oh, my God.  You should hear what the website calls Philadelphia.  Kiladelphia?  No.  There's another one?  Yeah.  Well, help me out.  I'll just say it.  They call it Gorilladelphia.  Wow.  Can you believe it?  Wow.  A racist website like that would call something. 
[01:12:30]  They're turning North Sully around a little bit.  Thanks, Rod.  I appreciate it.  A little bit.  You can get some nice real estate there and sit on it for a while and make some cash.  When there's two bodies dropping a day as of last year, I mean, you can get some shit  moved out.  Yeah.  All right, right.  They did it in Harlem.  When you look at a lot of the brownstones and stuff or the new buildings, we were going  up, we were going to, we drove through Harlem, the Spanish Harlem, and you could see it's  kind of a rough neighborhood, but then you'll see one brand new building, and it's a brand 
[01:13:00]  new block.  There's everything a white person would need.  Dry cleaner, police, fire department, it's all in one fucking building.  One fucking block of building.  Yeah.  I rode my bike through Harlem two days ago.  Two days ago.  I go to the GWB, and then I go east, and I ended up on 165th Street.  That's not bad.  And then I had to make my way back toward Central Park.  Yeah.  And I saw, I didn't see any shit going down.  No, no.  I saw people just enjoying their Sunday. 
[01:13:30]  You're not going to see anything really bad.  In the parks, they had a party for a grandma.  I saw that.  That was one of the pictures I took on my Instagram.  I saw just people living their fucking lives.  That's all I saw.  Yep.  Question is, how do you think that was?  I was in some shitty areas, man.  What's that ride?  But it was also the middle of the day.  I wouldn't do that same bike ride at night.  Not a bike ride.  No, you're better off walking.  Honestly.  It's one of those situations where if there's work, you won't get the ghetto.  You have a lot of these towns and cities that have big industrial movements, and when 
[01:14:00]  everything started shutting down, that's when you started getting the different types of  crimes coming in.  People starving.  People wanting to do something.  Instead of them moving and trying to do better for themselves, they're just going to rob  and steal from the next guy.  That's just the American way right now.  All right, Rod.  Thanks for your phone call, man.  Thank you, man.  I really appreciate it.  Sal's calling back from Jersey.  Sal.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Good morning.  I was just trying to make your point, but I imagine you had more to it.  Well, like I was trying to say, we replaced the women hundreds of years ago. 
[01:14:30]  We did make them slaves.  They weren't allowed to do anything.  And instead of using that and fighting and doing rioting, now they made themselves better.  They move up.  You have women making more money than guys.  They're moving up in the corporate world.  And everyone has that same opportunity, and you have a choice, like Anthony's been saying.  But you either choose the easy way out and feel that you're entitled to everything, or you pick yourself up and do the right thing.  That's all I was saying.  And I'm not, and I'm very, I'm not racist. 
[01:15:00]  Well, I don't want to say I'm not racist, but I'm not racist.  My two grandchildren are black.  My son-in-law is black.  So, you know, I just respect people for what they do with their life.  And I don't, and I, and I don't respect people that don't respect themselves.  And that's what it really comes down to.  Respect some of our respect.  But Sal, Sal, you're not wrong.  You're not wrong.  But you can't, you just gotta, I try to look at both sides of it, too.  Now, I'm not saying it's all one this way, but I just try to look at both sides a little bit and go, well, it's not, it's not out of, out of complete nowhere that this happened. 
[01:15:30]  Of course not.  It has a beginning, but at what point do we pick up ourselves and grow up?  Right.  I mean, you're in recovery.  At one point, you have to take responsibility for yourself and say, this is it.  I'm no longer that little kid getting beat up or raped or whatever, you know, in your case to me.  But, you know, you gotta take responsibility for yourself.  You're a grown-up now, and you have to do the right thing.  That's all there is to it.  That is the way of the world. 
[01:16:00]  Everybody gets, we all go through that.  I grew up, I was bullied when I was a little, you know, I sit around saying, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, my life is this.  No, I get up, I go to work every day, and I try to make a better life for myself and my family.  That's all we can do.  We can sit around and expect somebody to give me everything and do everything, and if I don't get my way, well, you're gonna pay for it.  And then it just turns around and becomes a show.  You know, I've called you guys before.  Well, I work, and I work, and I get to see a lot of different communities, and you go from block to block, and things change, and attitudes change. 
[01:16:30]  And that's just, you know, the way it is.  And I don't want to judge people.  Everybody's where they're supposed to be, but again, at what point do you become a man?  Right.  Step up, yo.  Step up and be a man.  Thank you, Sal.  I want to thank Tom for the phone call.  Say hi to your nephew.  See you later.  By the way, this all started with that video you saw last night from Buffalo, and I got more info from that. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, I am?  Sarah from Buffalo on Twitter, S-A-R-A.  The guy was a refugee who moved into a really old part of Buffalo.  House was burned.  He remodeled, and they burned it again.  Wow.  According to Sarah.  Let me say hi to Jay in Orange County, California.  Jay.  Jay-R, what's going on?  Jay-R, what's up?  Hello, Junior.  What's up?  Well, we have actual white skinhead gangs out here to protect our neighborhoods. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Like the guardian angels with skin instead of berets.  That's wonderful.  I just thought the beret was silly.  Beret looks really lame.  I never took those guys seriously.  No.  They looked ridiculous.  Exactly.  Like, I know Sleewa was trying to, you know, do something nice, but.  Cardianarians.  The angel beret.  It was ridiculous.  I want to go into a really, I want to interview, I want to go into a really black neighborhood  with Sam, because he'll be kind of like, they won't know what he is.  The liaison. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, he'll be kind of like the link between both of us.  Oh.  And, um, interview people.  I want to, I want to get, I really do.  Yeah?  Yeah, but I actually want someone to bring me in.  If we get your ass handed to you.  Well, you got to go in with somebody.  I don't know if you would, in the middle of the day, I wouldn't go at night.  You get that smack, that quick smack in the face.  Oh, I hate that.  Your fucking, your question was offensive or something.  It could be anything.  Anything.  I just, I'm not saying it can happen.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  But, yeah, I don't know.  I hear you.  I know.  All right.  I know.  You can't really leave him alone.  It's happened, but.  Should we go to break?  We got Sandusky shit that's too good.  We got to read that Sandusky shit.  Yeah, let's switch over to sick, depraved white people.  I know.  Yeah, let's go to what white people are really good at.  We've seen what black people do wrong.  Now here's a white guy's specialty.  Soap games in the shower.  Exactly.  We also got a clip from Jesse Ventura on Piers Morgan. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, good.  I heard about that.  I didn't watch it.  Which is terrific.  Is it good?  Oh, Jesse rules.  Got to get to that.  And, you know, his own way, I should say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Gun crime, things like this, gang-related violence.  It's going to be minority.  Calling for the hate.  Tell this to be hate.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me.  Rolling for me.  Tell this to be hate.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me. 
[01:19:30]  Somehow, white people are all responsible.  It ain't white.  It ain't white.  And right by my home, I'm looking at a home invasion.  It ain't white.  Hey, you fat fuck.  Make a movie called Rolling for me.  Hey, tell this to be hate.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me.  Rolling for me.  Tell this to be hate.  Hey, I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me. 
[01:20:00]  Hey, I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me.  Hey, how about you do that?  Make a movie called Rolling for me, hey.  Oh, that's a beat.  Hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me.  Hey, hey.  Rolling for me, hey.  Till this to be hate. 
[01:20:30]  Hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Rolling for me.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  And if you come near my daughter, guess what?  On Sirius XM.  You'll be reported to the cyber police and the state police.

On the next American War Stories, Battleground, Iraq, Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant  realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve, so we brought little bars and stuff.  There's going to be no food.  There was more, I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  There was, you go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza, ice 
[01:22:00]  cream.  You can walk up to this ice cream and get as many ice cream bars and sunnies as you want.  But no matter how rich the rewards, every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there, I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories and the defeats for American hero, Bob Kelly. 
[01:22:30]  I broke my knee, man!  On the next American War Stories.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Yeah, I wouldn't give Anthony F.U. for making me almost drive off the side of the road,  but using the word strudel, strudel, and that Andrew Dice Clay voice,  Jesus Christ, man, I will fucking wreck my car and last my ass off.  F.U.!  F.U.! 
[01:23:00]  F.U.!  I want to send a big F.U. out to my side pussy who fell in love with me  and then told my wife to rule in my life.  F.U.!  F.U.!  This next F.U. goes out to that cocksucker who just caught me off in the middle of traffic.  Hey, I hope you get fucking hit in the face with a goddamn handful of shit come by a homeless man  and then he eats your face.  F.U.  F.U.  F.U.  I want to give a big F.U. to Chip.  He's really becoming a problem in my life, taking social events to the next level.

[01:24:00]  F.U.  F.U.  Oh, Mimi Beardley, have you done this before?  Mimi Beardley, Mimi Beardley, that can't go back into the left.  Fuck you, Drew Boogie.  Fuck you!  Call the O.P.  and Anthony F.U.  line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. 
[01:24:30]  Let me guess, this happened on this date 800 years ago.  Not even trying, huh?  You rock.  And he's playing the Genesis song with the puppets, remember?  Yeah, that looked pretty good.  Probably put together a little monte.  How many years ago was that?  25 years ago.  Wow.  Yes.  Good old Reagan there. 
[01:25:00]  Tear down that wall.  George H.W. Bush.  88 years old today.  Speaking of presidents.  Hmm.  H.W.?  You rock.  We're calling you the California key.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh.  You're the new California key.  It was Florida.  It was.  You were listening to it, too, and didn't pick up on it, so.  Dude, I didn't adamantly say that it was.  Yeah, we said it was Florida.  No, I was thinking Florida the whole time.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Until you said California, then I got confused.  No, I actually went to California.  It sounds like California.  I did, too.  I went with him.  I was just like, yeah, I guess.  I heard it like he knew, and he knew Florida.  I heard it.  I should have known better.  I just assumed California.  I should have known better.  There's no West Palm in California.  There isn't, huh?  Yeah, no one said that either.  Palm Springs.  You did.  Nobody said West Palm.  I said Palm Beach.  I don't think so.  Oh, wow.  The story we were just watching on Fox, someone just tweeted it to me.  The father who killed a man trying to sexually assault his daughter. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Good for that fucking father, man.  Four-year-old daughter.  Right.  There was a guest in his house, I guess.  Now, the story says trying to molest.  You're saying it was...  Oh, well, from what I read, it seemed like he was, you know, molesting.  Completely in.  Well, whatever.  Completely in.  Completely in on the molestation, if you know what I mean.  Well, he was molesting.  So the father killed the guy.  Good for him.  God, I hope he doesn't do jail time.  I do. 
[01:26:30]  Texas father has not been arrested.  Has not been arrested and is unlikely to face charges.  After he beat a man to death for trying to molest his four-year-old daughter at his rural ranch.  Fucking A.  One for the father's.  Nice.  What happened?  Beat him to death with his hands.  There doesn't appear to be any reason other than what he told us.  So I guess you're allowed to kill molesters.  Well, you hope that's what the guy was doing.  It wasn't just a poker argument.  Yeah, I guess the cops are saying that he has a right to defend his daughter in that situation. 
[01:27:00]  And they're saying, I don't think it was his intent for the man to die.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he might have punched him and he falls down and hits his head.  No, I think when a father sees his four-year-old being molested, the intent is to kill the guy every time.  I'm sure in the police report it says, well, obviously he didn't mean to kill him.  And the man's grandfather also said his son was sorry and the killing was an accident.  There you go.  The killing wasn't an accident.  Off the hook.  Good for the father. 
[01:27:30]  Good for him.  He should go to jail.  Oh, Jesus.  That's unnecessary.  He should have talked it over.  What did she say?  What was her part in it?  You don't just go beating people up.  They may have been in a relationship like Romeo and Juliet.  Romeo and Juliet.  Maybe they were going to elope or something.  You don't go beating people up for being in love. 
[01:28:00]  That father needs to go to jail and be punished.  Terrible.  So you're saying the father deserves to be punished now.  Yeah, he interfered with that relationship.  What if it wasn't a relationship?  Sure it was.  They was getting to know each other.  This makes it much better.  Yeah.  Oh, how are you, my darling?  She was four.  Hello.  Uncle Paul, she was four.  Sure, that's what I'm saying. 
[01:28:30]  She's ready to travel.  Travel?  You're going to elope like Romeo and Juliet.  Of course, Romeo.  It's a beauty for love story.  And then the father comes in and starts yelling,  Oh, what are you doing, Paul?  Get that out of there between the crib bars.  She's going...  She's going...  She's going...  She's going...  No, no, no, no, no.  She's...  Get that out of the crib bars. 
[01:29:00]  She's going at it.  She's going at it like a gerbil going after a little water bottle.  Oh, come on.  Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah, everybody's got to yell at you.  No reason for that.  Why don't you just talk things over?  Hey, what are you doing? 
[01:29:30]  Is everybody okay with this?  Sure.  Sure.  Tell the father to get out of here.  Go in there and watch the TV.  We're making love.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Uncle Paul, that is despicable.  It's not despicable.  And then my friend Jerry's in trouble.  Oh, Jerry Sandusky?  Sure.  We used to get together and play the old frickle frackle.  Frickle frackle.  Yeah, that's where you put, like, all the soapy suds on your penis. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  And you move your hips like a hula hoop.  And the water's splashing the boy in the face,  and he's getting frickle frackled.  Never heard of frickle frackle.  Sure, when the suds are flying off his cheek,  and everybody's laughing.  Like the Sandusky soap fights that we heard about from victim number four?  Yeah, we'd have all sides.  Four was a bummer.  Five and six were fun.  We'd do the old frickle frackle.  Why do you think they're calling them victims 
[01:30:30]  if they were willing participants?  His name is Victor, is it?  No, it's Victim.  Oh, I didn't hear that good.  Well, you thought all their names were Victor.  Yeah, Victor four, Victor five.  You put all the soapy suds on your peenie,  and then you slap the cheek while the water's splashing,  and it looks like slow motion of the dogs shaking the soap off them.  You give them the old frickle frackle. 
[01:31:00]  Goddamn tattletales.  Oh, he's in Dutch, huh?  Mmm.  Quite a jam.  Oh, that father gets in big trouble for beating up that lady's boyfriend.  Lady?  She's four years old.  People are saying you've got to mention it was in Texas.  Of course.  Yeah, Texas.  They certainly have their own law in Texas.  Yeah, they're ruthless.  They've learned over the years.  They don't treat you nice down there.  They don't fuck around with bullshits.  They kept thinking I was riding a file bike or something. 
[01:31:30]  They thought I kept riding in a way.  I don't know.  They was yelling at me.  A file bike?  Yeah, who's Megan Slaw?  Megan Slaw.  I don't know who she is.  A file bike.  Oh, my God.  They kept saying, this Slaw girl, Megan Slaw.  I don't know her.  I think it's Megan's Law.  No, Megan's Slaw.  They were yelling at me. 
[01:32:00]  I'm like, I never met the lady.  Yeah.  I don't know who she is.  Lady.  And they were saying pedophile.  They weren't saying pedal file.  Pedal your file bike.  Oh, of course.  Get that out of the crib, Paul.  She's slipping and slapping at it with her little hands. 
[01:32:30]  Quit poking that between the crib bars.  Oh, God damn.  That guy should get in big trouble.  Interfering with a married couple like that.  They weren't married.  Sure they were.  Four-year-olds can't get married.  Yeah, they can.  His old balls hanging over the crib like a mobile.  Sure.  Just because you don't know how to make a smile and giggle, and I do. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  When they hang over there, when the sack hangs over, and they go, ha, ha, ha, and they slap  at it like it's a toy and such.  It sucks.  Yeah, they just slap at it with both hands, and everybody laughs.  Oh, you are fucking horrible.  Well, Texas sure has a way of delivering their own justice.  I like the cop as it goes in there.  Well, case closed.  I love it.  Fuck you.  We should have more of that. 
[01:33:30]  John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey, boys.  Hey, John.  What do you see?  Well, I'm going to hunt out this video.  Back in the 80s, a news crew captured a guy on a phone, and his son's molester was extradited  into an airport, and he just turned right around.  Yeah.  We've seen that one.  I think most people have seen this video, but it's a classic.  What?  The father was on a pay phone?  Make him believe he was just kind of a guy in the area, but he was the father?  Wearing a little hat. 
[01:34:00]  Of the kid that was molested, and they were bringing the molester through, and he fucking  took care of business.  Whatever happened to that guy?  We always had.  He was justifiable homicide.  I believe he was acquitted.  He was acquitted.  Yeah.  And he shouldn't have been.  My friend was a karate teacher.  You'd get in there, and everybody would take off our clothes, and he'd go, hey-ya!  Hey-ya!  And you'd roll around doing judo-judo.  How do you know all these people?  They're friends of mine.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  He was my karate friend.  Hey-ya!  Hey-ya!  Yeah, let me show you the crane.  Oh, oh.  Oh, boy, not the crane.  Sure.  Yeah, sensei.  Give sensei Paul a kiss.  That's not right.  We don't have the video anymore?  I don't know where it is.  I'm probably putting in...  I wasn't searching that.  Oh, Sam's trying to search something that happened before he was even born, I'm sure.  Well, the guy had a hat, sunglasses on.  He shot right between the cops, and the guy killed him. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  The cops were pissed.  And then he just put his gun down and put his hands up right away.  Why were the cops pissed?  Because they didn't want to get shot?  Because the guy shot someone right between them.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah.  They were like, I'm sure it was their job to protect the guy.  Oh, yeah.  Hey-ya!  I'm sure the cops were happy in the end.  Kidnapped son.  Oh, is the kid kidnapped?  When Jody was rescued and returned to his family, his father, Gary, was coping with reports  that Doucette had sexually assaulted his son.  Oh, boy.  We didn't know what to do. 
[01:35:30]  You just feel helpless.  Ten days later, when the police flew Doucette back to face trial, Gary Ploshe was waiting  with a gun.  Oh, boy.  The suspect came through the airport.  I read it, my camera, raced it up.  Can you pause?  To get a close-up shot.  I didn't know he was kidnapped.  Times have changed.  Yeah.  As the suspect was walking through the airport, meaning the other guy had a gun in the airport.  Yes.  I just want to point that out.  Oh, shit.  How weird is that to hear? 
[01:36:00]  Wow.  I think the payphone was the weirdest part.  Yeah, payphone.  Well, fuck it.  You were able to have a gun in the airport.  You could have a gun right here in the airport.  In the airport.  In the airport.  Whatever I have to talk about.  You could shoot a molester right here in the airport.  Right here.  You could have a beer right here in the airport.  Airport.  But he would add a lot of syllables to words, that guy.  He certainly would.  Right here.  All right.  Let's see that.  Come on, Sam.  There was the one cop and the, yeah, the molester was closest to the guy at the payphone. 
[01:36:30]  Put this up on our Facebook page there, E-Rock.  You know how excited he must have been to see, like, holy shit, he's walking right this  way.  Unbelievable.  Here he comes.  Let's see that again.  And he...  Wow.  You see his head just go fucking bullshit.  No, I didn't see that.  His hair pops.  See if you can get a frame. 
[01:37:00]  That one detective kind of gives him a hug.  You see that?  Yeah.  See if you get one frame.  Oh, yeah.  The top of his head jumped up.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like right there.  Yeah, look.  You see a piece of brain, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, a piece of his fucking brain or scalp or something.  But he's not even reacting yet.  Like, he's not even...  No.  His brain's gone right there.  Goodbye.  Wow, that Club Soda Kenny guy was pretty close, though.  Oh, shit.  That's...  But I thought that he was between two cops. 
[01:37:30]  I remembered it differently.  Oh, man.  So did I.  Hit that play.  He nailed it.  Damn it.  Yeah, he goes, God damn it.  That shoots and kills him.  Gary, why?  Gary, why?  And to this day, it stands out in my...  Gary, why?  Why would they say Gary, why?  Here's why.  You motherfucker, idiot.  Fucker molested my son.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I have to answer that for you? 
[01:38:00]  The shooter, Gary Plosche, says,  if it had been your child, you would have done the same thing, too.  There you go.  Oh, man.  Today, Abram McGill is an assistant U.S. attorney  and views that tape through the eyes of a federal prosecutor.  I would have to say the videotape was the most ideal witness in this case.  Premeditated martyrs.  You can actually see him take the gun out of his boot.  Look at this fucking shot.  Pull it up to the shoulder lever of Jeff Doucette  and pull the trigger and shoot him.  What an amazing... 
[01:38:30]  Dude, that's amazing.  He was coming up under his other arm.  Well, he didn't even bring it up to his arm.  Hold on.  He was holding the payphone with his left hand,  so then he was able to bring it up perfectly.  He brought his gun up underneath, but he wasn't even aiming.  I don't know about that.  It was almost like a shot from the hip.  He came up.  No, he came up right to the arm,  knowing that's going to brace him for the shot.  Oh, man.  Five years probation.  And that is premeditated murder.  Absolutely.  But he was just grief-stricken. 
[01:39:00]  And the kid wasn't even killed,  but he still did the right thing.  That wouldn't happen now.  No.  They would absolutely fucking put him in prison.  I don't know.  We've gotten soft.  I believe you're right, Anthony.  Let me go to Rob in Massachusetts.  Rob?  Hey there, Rob.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  I have a level three sex offender  that just got out of prison after 24, 25 years  for raping and molesting...  Well, raping, tying up an 11-year-old for two days  and sodomizing her and raping her with his friend. 
[01:39:30]  And the guy's 45.  He was convicted in 86.  And he just got moved out of prison.  He's married to an 80-year-old woman now.  Wow.  Runs the gamut.  So when are you moving?  Exactly.  Well, I'm going through a divorce,  so luckily I have to short sell my property.  But everybody's in open arms.  There's kids everywhere.  He's not even on parole.  I understand these guys, you know,  he did his time,  but they can't put him somewhere else. 
[01:40:00]  You should never get out.  Can't they have a town or something for molesters  so you know where they all are?  Shoot.  And there's been studies.  There's no repairing that.  There's no repairing it.  No.  There isn't, right?  This is not fucking a 16-year-old girl.  When you tie up an 11-year-old for two days,  you should never get out of jail.  Ever.  No.  Wait, that's what this guy did?  Yeah, the guy who's getting out,  he did 25 years.  For tying up an 11-year-old?  For two days?  Yeah.  How do you get out?  He had a 15-year-old sister, too,  that they raped,  but they took the 11-year-old, 
[01:40:30]  him and his friend,  and took him to another place  and for two days,  they raped him.  More importantly,  do you have small talk with a guy like,  hey, you see the LA Kings last night?  They won the Stanley Cup.  You know that song that you guys play?  I play it all the time now,  Don't Touch Me Like That.  Oh.  I play that when I roll up,  the mix that somebody did.  I heard it on your show.  Sure, he loves it.  What was the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode  where Larry David befriends a child molester  because he fixed his golf swing  and then he brings him to the dinner party? 
[01:41:00]  That's fucking hilarious.  Oh my God, it was hilarious.  That show's crazy.  Did he know he was a child molester?  Oh yeah, but he didn't care  because the guy did his time,  whatever, he was released,  and I think he met him in a parking lot  and he kind of fixed his golf swing,  so now he was Larry's best friend  and he brought him around to a dinner party.  It's a great episode.  It's so twisted and sick.  The guys should never get out.  Of course not.  It's sickening that we let these people out.  And then you do let them out  and then you just throw them in a building somewhere. 
[01:41:30]  There's got to be another way to do that.  Yeah.  Like I said, I know they did their time  and it is America, blah, blah, blah,  but still.  It's because it's not...  When some people spend time in prison,  they know they get out and go like,  oh my God, I'm never going to rob a bank again.  That fucking sucked, you know?  But these guys,  there's no fucking fixing that.  You just fucking...  You got to be put to sleep.  So what is the building saying, Rob?  Well, they sent out a letter.  A holy shit memo? 
[01:42:00]  It's come to our attention  that a level three sex offender  has moved into the complex.  Does it get...  Hold on.  Does it get worse than level three?  I don't know.  No, that's the worst.  Isn't four...  Oh, wow.  Three is the worst.  Three is the worst, yeah.  That means you put a penis in something.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  It really is.  Everyone's trying to get him out,  but there's really nothing they can do  because he's not on parole.  Well, does he seem like a nice guy?  I don't know.  He's married to an 80-year-old woman.  And how old is he? 
[01:42:30]  He's 40?  45.  45.  If everyone is just mean to him,  he'll eventually leave.  Yeah, I don't know.  Everyone's telling me that I should...  If everyone's just mean to him...  What town is this?  Mansfield.  Mansfield.  Wow, really?  Boysfield.  Yeah.  Surprised he doesn't go to Girlsfield.  I just say that.  You fucked my joke up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  God damn it.  Anything else for Rob?  This is a crazy story.  Yeah.  Say hi to Steel. 
[01:43:00]  Redemption.  All right, guys.  I love you guys.  I'm watching out.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Ryan in Louisiana  who supposedly worked with those two cops  from that video we just watched.  Yeah.  And that video's up on our Facebook page  if you've never seen it.  Opie and Anthony, one word?  Yeah.  How do we do that on Facebook, Yurok?  Opie and Anthony, one word, yeah.  One word, okay.  People are saying you're having a man period today,  by the way, Yurok.  Ah, man period.  Are you having a man period today?  He is a little pissy.  Why are you so pissy today?  Did he get in trouble for the paper cut thing yesterday? 
[01:43:30]  A lot of people want to know.  Uh, no.  Does that mean he was talked to?  I don't know.  He's just like...  He's so fucking...  He's trying to do a radio show, Yurok.  Yeah, he's doing an update from that crap from yesterday.  What happened?  We talked and there's no problem.  We can't do that bit,  but there was no fallout from yesterday.  I received a great tweet about that yesterday.  A guy goes, wait, let me get this straight.  I saw that one.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  I know exactly what you're going to talk about. 
[01:44:00]  That had a guy put his erect penis in a dead monkey.  Now has to ask permission to paper cut a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I read that and started laughing.  And that's why I love bringing that shit up.  Because it's crazy.  Fucking great.  It's crazy what happened to this business.  I just gotta love that.  Ryan, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Yeah, I used to work for the sheriff's department here in-  I do a radio show.  And the two guys, two cops that were at the airport, 
[01:44:30]  one was actually the chief.  He was the chief of narcotics.  And the other one was the chief of detectives.  And almost 100% of the time,  you don't have high-profile guys going,  bringing in somebody on an extradition.  But they just happened to do that.  And the big rumor is that it was all planned and set up  between Gary Ploche and the two sheriff's deputies  that brought the guy in. 
[01:45:00]  It is odd.  They knew who that was right away.  Yeah, but also-  Who else would do it?  Well, you know, there could be some-  They aren't detectives.  They know shit.  I guess they detected that.  But who lets you shoot somebody while they're walking with them?  Yeah, that would be a little crazy if there was a setup.  One of your guys could get shot.  And they never would have let that camera guy be right there.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Hey, you, move.  There's something happening there.  Why would you let the camera guy be right there?  Right.  Well, that's the funny part.  The guy that said, why, Gary, why?  He was the chief detective for narcotics. 
[01:45:30]  And I just-  Why would a narcotic detective be-  Why would he be bringing in a sex offender  when you could have, you know, your sex crime vision or whatnot?  And it so happened that, you know, flash forward 20 years later,  one of the cops is the second in command of the sheriff's department.  And the other one is the head of detectives.  So, like I said, it's been a rumor for a long time  that the whole thing was a setup. 
[01:46:00]  Was this Jesse the body?  Yeah, what is he?  Wait, he was a chief.  It's a conspiracy.  Was he a chief of the Indians or something?  No.  Jesus Christ.  No joke.  See, Anthony said that.  I know.  I know, Chip.  Why don't you do that?  Just say it's a joke.  It's okay, Chip.  Don't get upset.  Piece of shit.  It was all planned.  A grand scheme put together by the detectives.  Shut up.  You want to hear what he said on Cheers, Morgan?  I certainly do. 
[01:46:30]  The whole hour was terrific, but-  Ah, I was going to catch the replay of Piers,  but I was too busy watching hate videos.  We've got a nice highlight here, though.  Here's Jesse Ventura, our old pal, on Piers Morgan.  Well, he did the show a lot.  Yeah, at one point, I guess he was-  He did the show three or four times easy before-  I ruined it.  Before Jimmy ruined it.  Reined it.  With rat-haired you.  Yeah.  It's ruined.  Jesse, how are you?  I'm doing well, Piers. 
[01:47:00]  How are you?  Yes, you are looking very well.  Now, two things I want to clarify with you.  One is why you're not with me here in the studio.  And secondly, where have you been?  Because you've disappeared.  Well, first reason why I'm not with you in the studio  is I've quit flying because I have metal in my body,  so every time I go to an airport,  the metal detector goes off,  and they treat former governors like criminals out there.  You know, I get treated like a criminal, 
[01:47:30]  and I've had enough.  I won't be treated like a criminal anymore,  so the only alternative is not to fly.  I tried to bring a federal lawsuit-  It's like-  Wait, hold on two seconds.  This is like that fucking bit.  I'm driving.  If Vince McMahon can do that,  he could take down a plane.  I'm driving.  Remember that bit?  Yes, of course.  Holy shit, now he's not fucking flying.  The guy is just a jerk-off.  He's just a jerk-off.  Oh my God. 
[01:48:00]  Good.  Imagine having to sit next to this boar on a flight.  Oh, what a douche.  And you know what else happened back in the Gulf of Tonkin incident?  All right, Jesse.  We heard you.  I'm fucking-  Just give me a drink.  Stupid ass.  He was a governor, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what always creeps me out.  That was just a fuck you to the system.  That's all that was.  The same reason they voted for Ross Perot,  that was like to fuck you to regular politics.  Once in a while, you'll get that,  where people like Ron Paul,  like Ron Paul is an interesting guy,  but it feels like a fuck you to regular politics. 
[01:48:30]  That's why people like him.  Yeah.  I tried to bring a federal lawsuit  against the TSA and Homeland Security,  and imagine this.  The judge threw it out,  claiming she did not have jurisdiction.  Now, it was a constitutional question.  So if she doesn't have jurisdiction,  no one does.  And people in this country need to understand,  when you go to any airport in the United States,  you are not protected by the Constitution  or the Bill of Rights. 
[01:49:00]  They can do anything they want to you,  and there's nowhere you can go to seek redress.  Out the front door.  How about Mexico?  Yeah.  Dunce.  So he's making his life way difficult.  He's just a fucking whore who loves,  loves being in the spotlight,  which I don't mind that,  or have lack of respect for that.  Yeah.  But it's his whole persona.  He's the conspiracy.  And I'm not driving either.  I'm not going to drive on the corrupt highway system  of this country.  And I'm not even taking bicycles. 
[01:49:30]  I'm walking with no shoes  because the taxes on the shoe on footwear  goes to fund terrorism.  Wow.  What?  That's a great Jesse.  Oh.  That's a great Jesse.  Just needs to listen to him a little more.  Get that shh, shh on the teeth.  That's great.  Sounds like he's got a denture problem.  Purizad calls him out a little bit.  A little bit more than these other idiots out there.  I'm exposing Area 52.  It's one more.  What happened to his show? 
[01:50:00]  What happened to your show there, Jesse?  Oh, people didn't like it.  Wait, Mr. Balloonigan's...  Oh, people didn't like it.  You want to play the clip of him walking off the show?  We haven't done it in a while.  Is that where it happened?  You don't have to play the whole thing, right?  Or is it worth playing the whole thing?  No, this is good.  Hit it.  That's what I want to address.  Jesse just sits and looks at Jimmy.  Why? 
[01:50:30]  Awkwardly.  That was a fair point I just made.  You were wrong when you said that.  I don't know.  I didn't listen.  I didn't talk over everything.  Always.  You're a big guy.  I talked over you.  Yes.  You're just now yelling at me because I'm not talking.  I'm not yelling at you.  I'm just yelling about your point.  You accused us of something.  No, I didn't accuse enough.  I'm sure you did.  You guys are just full of shit.  You're a warmonger.  That's not the truth.  Yeah.  Yes.  I stand corrected.  Thank you.  You're a great American. 
[01:51:00]  Well, I'm not saying I'm a great American, but I'm not a warmonger.  When your country calls, you're there.  Hey, I've never been in the military, so you're brave.  I'm a coward.  I have no right.  We got it.  Stop.  Did I say that?  Yes, you did through implication.  We all speak this.  We have the commonality of language, so you can't say did I say that when you say something.  I love this.  To me.  You did it to me.  You said I don't believe in the Constitution.  Bye, guys.  Bye, guys.  Governor.  You always just sulk and walk away.  Why?  You put words in my mouth.  Hey, there's a fucking guy here telling me I got a schedule, asshole. 
[01:51:30]  You're using dirty language, asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Right there.  Pause.  He wanted to.  Holy fuck.  Right there in his mind.  He was thinking about it.  He's like, I think I'm going to punch him.  He was thinking.  Yeah.  And then he took a long sip, whatever, gulp of water, and then he calmed himself down.  Calmed himself and thought.  He was going to swing at you right there, Jimmy.  I know.  And I thought he might.  I thought he was a douche.  He fucking, and this is why I didn't like when he touched me, because I saw exactly what  that was.  He, again, he wanted to, you know, I've been over this, but he was like, asshole. 
[01:52:00]  So I called him an asshole.  And it looks like, I wish you had more tape on that thing, because it looks like I'm being  worse than I am, because the entire interview is not there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I always tell people when they interview me, I'm like, okay, you fuck, go find the  unedited tape.  Which is, it's up there, too.  It is, it is available.  Yeah, there's a longer version up there, I think.  But he called me an asshole, so I called him an asshole back.  Back up, though.  I want to see the look he gives you.  It was so obvious that he was ready to punch you. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Really obvious.  Why did he call me an asshole, so fuck him?  Hey, there's a fucking guy here telling me I got a schedule, asshole.  He's using dirty language, asshole.  Yeah.  As soon as he said asshole, he wanted to punch you.  Oh, look at him, yeah.  He said to punch you, he drank the water.  Bye, tough guy.  Bye, tough guy.  And thanks for your service to our country.  You're welcome.  Thanks for touching me with your fucking stupid, ripped, riffrapped, fucking Rocky Horror hairdo.  You're bigger than me and stronger than me.  So what?  I don't give a shit.  You want to beat me up?  Go ahead. 
[01:53:00]  I'm not going to fight a guy like you.  That means nothing to me.  I argued with you.  You put words in my mouth, and you didn't like when I did it to you.  You put words in my mouth saying, I didn't believe in the Constitution, and that's bullshit.  It's not true.  I don't agree with you.  I'm abusing it.  Thank you for your service, Tom.  Oh, you're welcome.  You're a bigger patriot than me.  Godspeed.  Fuck out of here.  Ha, ha.  Wow.  I can't let it talk. 
[01:53:30]  Fucking baby.  That ended up.  Fucking baby.  No.  This is shit.  I love Jimmy's...  This fucking guy.  You just look like a little guy yelling.  I love Jimmy's plane, trains, and automobiles.  Thank you.  You hear the cadence from planes, trains, and automobiles.  Go on, hit me.  I don't care.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Hit me.  I was so...  But again, I'm not...  I'm not a tough...  I really am not a tough guy.  I'm not going, I'll kick your ass, because I know there's people around.  It's not about that.  We were just arguing.  We were two guys arguing, and you should never fucking touch. 
[01:54:00]  He knows the fucking rules.  If that was Brock Lesnar he was arguing with, he never would have touched him.  He did.  He patted you on the back pretty hard, too.  I knew what he did.  We all knew what he did, and that's why I hate his fucking supporters.  That's why I fucking hate all you conspiracy douchebags who didn't see what a cunt he was acting like.  Like, if people wrote me and went, I agree with Jesse, I don't like you, but he was kind of being an asshole there.  Yeah.  But they're all like, you disrespected the governor!  Fuck you, and fuck him.  Thanks for your service. 
[01:54:30]  If he's an intelligent human being, he would have hung in there and continued arguing.  Yeah, I don't know.  I wasn't listening.  Oh, sorry, you just like to dominate everybody with your stupid fucking Midwestern accent.  He had nothing to say.  He had nothing in his head at that point.  Yeah, I agree.  And the pat was absolutely supposed to be a punch.  And he wasn't trying to hurt me.  I'll say this in fairness.  He was not trying to hurt me.  It was not like he was just taking...  You don't fucking do that.  You don't do it.  He was out of his mind because he really wanted to punch you. 
[01:55:00]  He just wanted to fucking hit you back.  He wanted to and he couldn't.  So he did that.  And for me to match him, he called me an asshole, I called him an asshole.  He called me a tough guy, I called him a tough guy.  And then he one-upped it.  He patted me.  Yeah.  And I felt it and I knew what the interaction was.  Right.  So I would have to do two things.  Get up and touch him.  And that would have been a fight.  Which that's Jesse the Body Ventura.  Or do what I do, which you're going to use your sides, which is your thing.  Okay, so I'll be a cunt, which is my thing.  Yeah.  And I'm better at it than he is. 
[01:55:30]  Absolutely.  You're better at patting people hard and I'm better at being an insulting cunt.  Hence the riffraff hairdo line, which is killer.  But that had the same effect on him.  Oh, he was pissed.  That him patting me would have had on me.  Oh, was he pissed.  Too bad.  Stupid.  Don't do it.  I would never have insulted him personally like that if he had not insulted me first.  Never.  I would never have fucking cursed at him and I never would have insulted him.  If he didn't do it.  Even in that version of the tape, he looks kind of dumb.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And stupid.  He really does.  Like fucking. 
[01:56:00]  That's why I like to tape.  He's a big guy.  He should have hung in there and argued his points.  That's why I want to tape every interview.  Just because it's like when things like that happen, you never know when it's going to go off the rails and get uncomfortable.  And I want people to be able to see.  I got so many hate mails.  And fuck them.  I don't care about any of their anger.  I believe you got hate mails.  I still do.  And I just, for the record, I tell them, your anger means nothing to me.  Right.  I don't care.  You're angry.  You're a fucking internet coward who doesn't use his real name.  Good.  I don't care about your real.  I'm angry.  Really?  Go fuck your mother.  Oh, I thought those were their real names. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  I didn't realize that.  Thank you for your service.  I mean, at least we use our real names.  Thank you for your service.  Service.  I had an argument with a guy.  And they come to his rescue.  Yeah.  He can handle himself.  Jesse can handle himself.  Of course he could.  He can throw me through the wall.  To a point he can, I guess.  Hey, we're going to break and then we're going to finally get into the Sandusky victim  floor shit.  There was this little soap party that was being enjoyed by some people.  Everybody's playing Freckle Frackle. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, Freckle Frackle.  You soap it all up and you do the hula hoop.  Right.  And you slap the cheek with the water splashing.  Right.  And soap goes everywhere.  Goes everywhere like a party.  Sounds fun.  Between two consenting adults, right?  No, you got to have someone standing there who's face level.  Oh, so it's a midget consenting adult and you.  No, midget hands freak me out.  I jump up on a chair like an elephant when a mouse comes in the room when a midget touches 
[01:57:30]  me.  I even a midget touched my love handles one time.  I jumped up.  Yeah, there's a monster.  And it'll wait for me.  From a distance where you're excited that somebody was coming up to talk to you?  I remember when Fantasy Island came on, I was tugging away and then I'm like, oh, he's  a weird baby man.  Jesus.  Who's that weird baby man in the white suit?  I don't like his voice.  He looks so cute from the back. 
[01:58:00]  Aw.  Ding-da-dung-dung-da-ding-da-dung-dung-dung.  Walking up to the top of the bell.  Yeah.  Hey, meet me by the bell.  Well, ring-a-ding-ding it, little fella.  And then he starts yelling, da, the pain, the pain.  That's the plane.  Or whatever he was yelling.  He was a weird baby man.  Yeah.  Baby man.  Oh.  See, I hear this and I start to feel it in my undershirts.  Ah, Mr. Raw.  I didn't like him either. 
[01:58:30]  Ah, Tattoo.  Yeah.  Smiles, everyone.  Smiles.  Tattoo was cute.  Ah, yeah.  I like Tattoo.  That's Tattoo.  But I didn't like when he turned around.  I thought, what a full head of hair that baby has.  He has nice black hair you can muss up like a little aborigine.  I just wanted to muss his hair.  Then he turned around and he had big ugly man baby face.  His hands.  Ugly man baby face.  Yeah, he was a baby man. 
[01:59:00]  Ring-a-bell.  Yay.  That's the bell.  Ah.  Ah.  The voice bothered me.  The play.  You didn't like that?  No.  See, look at him from the side.  He looks so cute.  Tattoo.  He put creatures in our bodies.  Oh, yeah.  Do the old fickle freckle on that fella.  Oh.  That's who on the beach.  Yeah, there he is.  That's the picture I saw.  Oh.  Weird baby man.  That is odd.  He's a baby man. 
[01:59:30]  He looked like a little aborigine.  Is he a strange looking little fucker?  Oh, man.  Was he?  Look at his little hand on his hair.  How tall was he?  Ah.  About 4'1".  Perfect height for frickle freckle.  Because you can hit the chin.  Sandusky shit next.  And now, 88 seconds of former Minnesota governor, professional wrestler, and Navy SEAL, Jesse Ventura, talking crazy. 
[02:00:00]  And go.  Were they testing out HAARP?  And it created this tsunami that later killed hundreds and thousands of people?  Ah.  Ah.  They have such power.  Our president goes to it, and our president has to sign a no-talk thing.  And the real guy is this character called Maurice Strong.  That's the big point.  What if it is?  No.  Say that.  No.  Terrible.  No.  It shows how they can shoot these things down to masses of people and literally affect your emotions with them. 
[02:00:30]  They can cause you anxiety.  They can cause you fear.  And that was on the night that Jesus Christ supposedly rose from the dead.  Both.  Both.  Both.  Yep.  With this satellite, if they want to, they can follow you and know right where you're at.  It's eye-opening.  I don't do computers.  I'm computer illiterate, happily.  Probably.  But trust me, you know, I can do you in and not think twice about it. 
[02:01:00]  Oswald couldn't make the shots.  You know that as well as I do.  This thing's set up on the same frequency as the human brain.  Do you think that's by happenstance or by design?  Why would everything have to be locked up in national security for 50 years?  That's because you're not seeing the real medical evidence.  Could that be part of it, that they're heating up the ionosphere up there by using this thing?  Ford changed where the bullet hit.  They put him in the MRI and the machine went ballistic.  You know why?  Five chips in his body.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was 88 seconds of former Minnesota governor, professional wrestler, and Navy SEAL Jesse Ventura talking crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  I hear the music.  It gets into you.  I hear the music.  Millions of watts.  All of this low-level sound, well, it gets into you.  And so I said, well, you know what?  I hear the music.  Bring back the music.  All of this music.  Well, you know what?  I hear the music. 
[02:02:00]  And so I said to him, I said, bring back the music.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Fucking don't put fucking words in my mouth.  And so I said to him, I said, wait a minute.  I hear the music.  Wait a minute.  I hear millions of watts.  And so I said to him, I said, you all talk a big thing.  You only talk it.  You don't walk it.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth. 
[02:02:30]  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth  Don't put fucking words in my mouth  Billions of watts going up into the ionosphere  You hear it through the front of your skull  I hear billions of watts  You hear it through the front of your skull  Sirius XM  Yeah  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show 
[02:03:00]  I guess we lost Jimmy  What did he quit?  What happened?  He quit?  Jimmy quit  He's had it  Going old school, mean ass  He said screw this  He did, huh?  What got him?  Um, I don't know  He's had a glory hole in the fan  Aww  Yeah  Did you see Snooki's pussy? 
[02:03:30]  No  We probably should wait for Jimmy to come back  After he gets his picture with John Walsh  Is that what he's doing?  Oh yeah, he is  Adam Walsh  Oh, he's getting it signed  He's in the second stage  Yeah  The stages  Well, there's three stages  He stalks the celebrity for a while  Then he gets the picture with the celebrity  And then the final stage is getting the autograph on the picture  No, there's also the printing stage  There is a printing stage  Because you don't just  High res printing stage 
[02:04:00]  I forgot about that  When he goes to his favorite photo place  Get that nice photo  Made up of his little snapshot  Let me ask you  When you get a picture with a celebrity  Isn't that good enough?  Why does it have to be signed?  I just keep it in my  Digital fucking  Somewhere  Hard drive  From 20 different computers  File that you never look at again  Yeah, exactly  Yeah  Maybe if someone ever asked me  Hey, do you have a picture with such and such?  Oh, let me see here  Let me see  Yeah, I got that  Let me see  Like trading cards  Yeah 
[02:04:30]  Got it, got it, got it  Need it  Need it  Need it  So he's getting his picture sign  Yes  The final stage  That's the final stage  Oh no, then there's the framing stage  Yeah, but not all of them get framed  What happened?  Kenny just came barging in  I got scared  There is the framing stage  You are correct, Gage  Is there five stages?  Yes, and it has to have the museum glass, non-glare  Right  And all the same frame to match every other frame  Oh my God, how many of those frames has he bought? 
[02:05:00]  A lot of frames  But they're not all hanging up  No?  No, no, he has storage bins also  How many storage bins filled with these things?  Oh my God  Well, he bought  Who was that?  That was John Walsh, just walked by  That's not John Walsh  No, no, not that guy  Oh  The guy that walked by said just walked by  He's walking by right now  Travis, turn around and look  John Walsh  So that means Jimmy got his autograph, right?  He must have  Doesn't necessarily  Why?  You never know  Oh 
[02:05:30]  Kenny, you know your head's going to hit that light  Be careful  Oh my God, you're really close to it  Look how close that is  You're a monster  I don't even think twice about walking under these things  Oh, you can't  Alright, so there is a final stage  The framing stage and the museum glass  Wow, that's an expensive hobby, man  You'd see them in the glass  That's expensive  Museum glass is not cheap  No  Signing it  And I know all of my movie posters are covered  Yeah, and those were not cheap  No, they weren't  Why would you museum glass every single one of them?  Why don't you put it in a safe place and then decide which ones you want to 
[02:06:00]  Oh, they're going to get wrecked if you do that  Museum glass  You get the autograph?  No, I wasn't doing that  What?  After all that, we were talking about your obsession  No, I left the picture up front for when he comes out  But apparently John Walsh's people brought in some food  And it's in the dressing room by Howard Studios  So I just lost track of time for a second  I was getting some eggs  Aw, we thought you were getting your picture signed  No, no, no  I wouldn't not be on the show for that  Rudy tooty fruity  It's just food  It's okay if you're not  I mean, we all take our little breaks

Pop up, Snooki  This picture appeared yesterday on the internet  And people were trying to figure out if it was actually her  But now her people are kind of pissed off  I don't think there's any uncensored ones

She has a lot of space  She has a deep asshole, right?  You like that, huh, Jimmy?  The legs look a little too big, man  A little too big in the leg  Yeah, what's the  What are these 
[02:08:30]  Where are these pictures from?  How'd they get out?  That's on  Well  They don't know yet  Yeah, they don't know  They're obviously  The other ones are from her phone  It's probably her  It's probably  She took a little photos  She feels her celebrity is  Falling slightly  So she said, fuck, let me do this  Yeah, I'll fuck that pussy  When I was on Jersey Shore  God, I was on Jersey Shore  You're lying  You know, they started up the Jersey Shore again  It's gonna be the last season  Yep  And Dino  Dino already got arrested  That's right 
[02:09:00]  Boy, they're trying their best, aren't they?  They had a huge brawl  Trying to keep it going  I don't understand how they could have brawls  If they got all those people around  Yeah  I think they want the brawls  I'm trying to find the picture  Because we can't put that up on Facebook  We'll get in trouble, right?  No  Yeah  We can put up all the Black Bard ones  Yeah, do the Black Bard ones  I didn't see those other pictures  I just saw the pussy shot  Yeah, these are the ones that are in the movie  But she's got that thing clamped shut  With the legs fucking closed  Like that  That must be weird for her  When she opens it up 
[02:09:30]  I bet it's  It's probably an unfamiliar feeling  To have her muscles working that way  I bet it's crazy  Anyone?  Nothing?  Okay  Oh  It's like a toothless man yawning  I don't know  Sometimes she looks alright  Dude  Never  I would fucking eat that pussy and ass  Until the cows came home  Nice deep ass cheeks  Fuck yes  Look at those tits  She looks good  But you don't have to eat every chocolate chip cookie, Jimmy  What's that?  You don't have to eat every one  No, I don't  But a nice deep chocolate chip cookie

Big suckable areolas  Yeah  Blackpars don't have to be as wide as the tit  What the fuck is  Who edited these pictures?  I would eat Snooki's ass  And pussy  And not that she's pregnant 
[02:10:30]  Because that doesn't do anything for me  But that, I'm telling you  She has a juicy, deep ass crack  I'd go bananas in there  I'd go bananas in there  And I knew her pussy would be nice  And it is  You did?  Fucking chubby little pussy  Yes  Because she's a chub  Yes  So what?  It's a nice pussy  Yeah, yeah  Fuck, look at that  You tell me you wouldn't fucking lick that  It's a little thinner than you'd like  Well, we don't know if it's a nice pussy  Because she's clamped shut  Exactly  You put your dick in there  With those little chubby legs together  Yeah  And you lock your arms around them  And then she tweedles with your nipples 
[02:11:00]  Yeah  Yeah, man  Fuck, I'd come  My balls would be hitting the chair  I would rest on the chair  Oh  Here's the uncensored picture  I found it  Oh, which one?  Oh, God  You think popped  Look what happened  Are you serious?  Hold on  I did see it for a second, though  You did?  Yeah  Let me see  I didn't see it  Oh  There's the uncensored  Do you know that guy?  I don't know who she is  Please, let's be respectful  I do not know this lady  Exactly  Do you know that guy?  Chick with a gift  With a gift 
[02:11:30]  Is that a nice gift, Jimmy?  Oh, God  It looks Photoshopped to me  Yeah  But you know  She's trying to make it look bigger  By cupping the balls  Look at this old tranny trick  These old tranny tricks  When they want it to look bigger  They fucking do  What every other guy does  They take their hand  And they loop it under the balls  And they cup the bottom of the shaft  Like it's a massive cock  They're trying to make five look eight  And they don't give you money back  Oh  That's a trick, Opie  That's a shame  I don't like that trick  People love weird baby man, though 
[02:12:00]  Do they really?  They're big fans of weird baby man  I'm not one for pushing up on the bag  I think pulling down from the shaft  And almost using the top of your bag  Is a little more shaft  Yeah  Who's got a cockpit?  Let's share a cockpit  Hey, uh  I deleted all my cockpit  What a jerk  Hey, uh  No, they were yours  Oh, shit  That motherfucker got me  Mustang 970 on the Twitter  Oh  So that Massachusetts town  Passed that $20 fine for swearing?  Yeah  I didn't think that was going to go through 
[02:12:30]  It's going to get challenged  They can pass whatever they want  But then it's going to get challenged  As a First Amendment issue  That's Middleborough  Yeah  Stupid Middleborough  Wants to  Fine you $20 for cursing  And there's actually been  There's actually been a law in the books  For a lot of years  For many years  About cursing  One of those old school laws  That no one pays attention to anymore  Yeah  And it was a criminal law  So you would actually be charged  And arrested  If you're cursed  Now they just give you a $20 fine 
[02:13:00]  And it's not for just casually cursing  It's if you had a big outburst  In a public place  And were yelling like  I'd say motherfucker  Goddamn motherfucker  That would be $20 right  Yeah  What if you just said  Oh fuck  Oh fuck  I'm supposed to be on the other street  You'd be  I think you're okay  You're good there  Maybe they're saying  If the intent is to shock  Or disturb the peace  Yeah  I'm guessing it's something like that  But I mean  If you're gonna run around  Yelling  Heck darn damn  Then I've got nothing to say to you 
[02:13:30]  If you need to say  Heck darn damn real loud  Then we don't need to talk about anything  Who's this broad here  That Coco is beautiful  Black girl on Fox and Friends  She sang a national anthem somewhere  But she is  I'm hoping she's not 15  Because you can never tell  A couple of chicks today  She's beautiful  Why is she on TV?  Because she's a good singer  How pretty is she?  Because they found one that could talk  Coco Jones is pretty goddamn cute there  And I'm not even into black chicks  Dude she's beautiful  You gotta go black Ant  No I don't

[02:22:00]  Oh they're terrible too  Oh they're great  What do you mean first accuser  Why are they calling him victim four  Maybe he's the fourth victim  Of the first one to talk I'm guessing  Yeah  Yeah  Just an assumption  They don't go in numerical order  With the victims  It's like you want  You wanna  You wanna open big  And close big  So they open with  With this guy  And he's got some  Pretty lurid tales  Of that shower  Testify that the retired coach  Molested him in the locker room  Showers  And in hotels  While trying to ensure 
[02:22:30]  His silence  With gifts  And trips to bowl games  Nice  The man now 28  Dubbed victim four  In court papers  Left nothing to the imagination  As he told the jury  About the abuse  He said he endured  For five years  Beginning when he was a teenager  In the late 1990s  Well  Like when that chick  That Jimmy wants to fuck  Was born  Very late  I didn't say I wanted to fuck  Of course not  Jimmy  I just  On TV I saw her  She looked like an adult  I said she was very beautiful  She did  That's all 
[02:23:00]  It's fine  I didn't even have  Sexual feelings for her  I just thought  What a beautiful girl  She's very pretty  She is pretty  You wanted to kiss her  Yes I did  But she was sitting there  But she's still in the stage  Where you call her pretty  And she's dressed like an adult  And she's sitting next to adults  And she's as tall as the adults  So it's her fault  No it's the TV's fault  For not fucking knowing  That we're watching with no volume  And saying Coco 14  They should put that age  They should put  They should have a  Keep your dick in your pants disclaimer  As she's talking  It's her fault  Because she's very tall 
[02:23:30]  And appearing with adults  And very demure  Like I said  Her legs are crossed at the ankle  It was her dad  It was very  Yes  Alright here we go  So I've denied it forever  He says  Looking straight at the prosecutor  As Sandusky sat motionless  Nearby  Jacking off at the table  You think this shit  Turns him on  While he's sitting there in court  The court thing  Might put a damper on your boner  The fact that you're probably  Going to spend life in prison  Yeah  Is there going to be life for him 
[02:24:00]  He's 70 though right  Yeah  Isn't he up there  Yeah five years  Is life for him  But still  You have to  Your family  I mean when you're 70  You can live to be 94 years old  He might have a  Quarter century in jail  Oh man  A lot of cock in jail though  That's not young jail  Where you  You know  With the weights and everything  You're the old guy  In the library  This could be a problem  He lied to police  And even his own attorney  About the alleged abuse  The kid  Yeah and then finally said  I gotta talk about this  I don't even want to be involved now  To be honest 
[02:24:30]  He said  In the car  Sandusky would put his hand on my leg  Basically like I was his girlfriend  What a nice guy  It freaked me out extremely bad  The man said  Extending his arm  And pushing it back and forth  I pushed it away  After a little while  It would come right back  That drove me nuts  And he pushed it away  It came back  Pushed it away  Came back  Pushed it away  Pushed it away  Came back  How old was the guy  Until he came  At this point  He was probably a 35 years old  No he was  I guess he was still in school  Like how old though  I think he gets to a point  Where you can handle this shit 
[02:25:00]  Am I wrong to say that  How old was the kid  15, 16  13 or 14  Alright that's still a little young  I would have to admit  15 or 16 is young  But not that young  He's 28 now  98 was this  It's happening  97, 98  So say 97  Yeah  15 years ago  He was 13  13 okay  That's still definitely young  It gets to a point though  I think he can fight back  Especially an adult  Like that  Who's in a position of authority  And you think you're going to play  For Penn State  You know  Yeah 
[02:25:30]  I met Sandusky  Through the second mile  And they began showering together  In 1997  What began as soap battles  That's a long shower  Yeah  I bet they're wrinkly  Man I've been involved in sports  My entire life  I've never had a soap battle  I don't even know  What a soap fight is  It's like  I've heard of towel fights  I feel like I missed out on something  You did  Who the fuck has soap battles  I don't  You take soap in your hand 
[02:26:00]  And you make a squirty thing  And you're like  Look at my gun  And then you look at his gun  Oh  And then you squirts  And you say  Let's see who can get the soap  In each other's butts  What?  Get in there and clean it out  Squeaky  Oh that makes sense  Okay  He says  What began as soap battles  Quickly progressed to oral sex  And other contact  Wow  Jerry doesn't fucking play games  No  He's like enough with the soap battle  You're holding your little  Fucking Penn State pendant  He's fucking licking your bag  What a creep 
[02:26:30]  Here you go  You don't even get out  Your first version  Of  He goes right down on it  He was 90 or  90 to 100 pounds  And powerless  To resist the advances  Of the much larger man  Yeah  Fucking douche bag  Yeah  And I'll shine this rat on Jerry  Oh we mean Jerry  Oh right  But soap battles  Go right to oral sex  Soap battles to oral sex 
[02:27:00]  It's probably where you put  Like soap on your hair  And you slap each other's  And it's like  Ah gotcha  That sounds fun  Yeah  You got me  Ah gotcha  Or maybe you put soap on  And you throw it  On your friend's pecker  Ah you gotcha  Like Jerry's trying to keep it fun  The kids all creeped out  Like ah  Ah you got me  It's your turn  He takes the kid's hand  And he slaps his own ass with it  Ah you got me  Oh  Soap fights  Soap battles  Soap battles  He's doing enthusiasm  For both of them  Battles keeps it fun 
[02:27:30]  I'll bet you Jerry liked his big fat stomach rubbed  Like the kill player  Have to rub soap on his hairy man's stomach  He was  From what I read  He was always trying to maneuver his head  Down by the boy's genitals  Or have the boy's head maneuver  Towards his genitals  I don't know  There's a maneuver move  There's a way to just maneuver  Yeah  Ah you probably slide around  Soap games  Ah you got me  He's like  Oh you got me  And he kneels  Ah his mouth will be running to the dick  Ah  A maneuvering  According to the witness  Sandusky tried assaulting him 
[02:28:00]  In a hotel bathroom  Before a bowl banquet  In Texas  And threatened to send him home  When he resisted  Warning  You don't want to go back  Do you  You don't want to go back  He was going to send him home  Send him home  He was having fun  So everything was cool  Jerry likes to suck dick  Before the game  Before the big game  The big game  You take someone to a bowl game  You're not going to get a load off  Fucking why do you want to rely  And not be able to enjoy the game  Get the load out  I said blowjob  Before the game 
[02:28:30]  What a creep  Threatening to send him home  Yeah  What on a bus or something  Cutting him off  Yeah  Sandusky stopped only when his wife Dottie  Called out from another room  Dottie  Dottie  Over the years  The witness said  He never told Sandusky to stop  No thank you  It was never talked about ever  The man said  It was basically like  Whatever happened there  Never really happened  Oh  Oh this is someone jacking off in pal talk  Well they're listening to the transcript 
[02:29:00]  That is shit  You fucking disturbed asshole  Oh come on Ant  They're listening to this Ant  How could you not  Hey sexy 11-1  Oh  Sexy 11-1  Oh  Oh you bounced him  Jesus  A self-described college football fan  The man said  He enjoyed the access  To Penn State football games  And facilities  Exactly  The man said  Sandusky let him wear  The number 11 uniform  Of LeVar Arrington  Oh  So what  One of the star players  Of the team  Has no idea  His uniform was being used 
[02:29:30]  By the boys  That were molested  That were molested  By Sandusky  Just like having the boys  Ages on their backs  You fuck  You fuck  That's funny  Yeah  The man testified  That Sandusky also  Took him on trips  To bowl games  Including the Outback  And the Alamo Bowls  Sandusky gave him  Golf clubs  Wow  Snowboards  Drum sets  You know what  You just had to carry him home  In his ass  Whatever 
[02:30:00]  Yeah  A little frickle frack  Yeah  Let's think this over  A little bit  I grew up pretty poor  Yeah  I wouldn't mind  A nice set of golf clubs  A snowboard  Florentine did it  For pictures of wrestlers  And I liked  And I liked playing  I liked playing the drums  But we couldn't afford  A drum set  No  How much  How much dick  Would I have had  To suck for this shit  For all the toys  You wanted  Was it a one time  Mola station  Or  No  Not for you  You were the holy grail  Cause you had the 
[02:30:30]  Blue eyes  And the fucking  Little tussleable  Blind hair  You could get a lot more  And you were naive  When you were probably  10 or 11  You didn't know any better  What would I have  Had to do for the golf clubs  Then  I'll blow off the snowboard  And the drums  For golf clubs  Just the golf clubs  You definitely had to  You had to suck dick  While he diddled your hiney  With his finger  Yeah  I'd have to take a fingering  More than that  He wanted to kiss your neck  And probably your cute little lips  Cause you probably turned your head away  Cause his breath was bad  Hold on now  No but I'm just saying  Hold on now 
[02:31:00]  But I'm still in  Cause I really like golf  You like golf  I like golf  Alright so what  What happened so far  He lay behind you nude  And he kissed the back of your neck  And he'd take  He'd take your  Your weird thumbed hand  Cause he liked that  It was like a toe thumb  And he'd put it on his dick  And he would teach you  How to tug it back and forth  Oh that's a good thing  And your confusion  You wouldn't do it too rough  I'm still learning  Yeah  I'm still learning  And then you'd feel like  Like ah he must have  Dropped some water on me  Oh no  Cause there's like a little bit  Of the pre-stuff  Oh no  But I think it's water  Slug trailing along your buttocks 
[02:31:30]  But I think it's water  And then he'd kiss you  And I'm still learning  And then he'd turn around  Well the kissing thing  Is starting to get a little weird  He'd lay on his back  And he'd pull you over his belly  Jerking off on your ass  But the kissing thing  Is getting a little weird  Well cause I think it's water  Yeah  Jimmy said  Jimmy's allowing me  To think a certain way  He'd pull young Greg over  Onto him  And he would guide your head  With his big man hand  Onto his prick  And just teach you to suck  Oh no  Now you got a dick in your mouth 
[02:32:00]  But he wouldn't blow you  Cause your dick was too small  At that age  So he would just  He would just tongue out  Your butthole  While your little legs  Kicked and didn't hit the bed  Because his chest  And stomach were so high  Your little legs  Would kick him  And hit the bed  And they would cool him  Your little feet  Would fan his hot head  The golf clubs  Would include like a golf bag  And a driver  Oh yeah  A whole shebang  And a few tees  Oh yeah  A whole schmear  Set him up with the whole schmear  A lot of brand new golf balls  Oh yeah  Whatever you wanted  Some of those naked lady tees 
[02:32:30]  A couple of those  He'd eat his ass  He'd eat your ass  And your little feet  Would kick and fan him  You'd go like  Ah  That's nice  But my handicap  Would go down  Oh man  Yeah  What a fucking loser  So he gave him  The golf clubs  The snowboards  The drum sets  Various Penn State memorabilia  Including a watch  From the Orange Bowl  The man testified  He said he would wear  Gift jerseys to school 
[02:33:00]  Oh  The witness said  Sandusky occasionally  Sent him  Creepy love letters  Oh  One  One letter  Shown on a video screen  In court  Was handwritten  On Penn State letterhead  And signed jury  What a dope  Achiever letters  Yes  Begging to get caught  He's not  No  He knew no one  Was going to  Fucking rat him out  Right  It read  I know that I have  Made my share of mistakes  However I hope  That I will be able  To say that I cared  There has been love  In my heart  He's a real 
[02:33:30]  In my opinion  He sounds like  A real pedophile  If this is true  Like he loves the kids  He doesn't want to hurt them  Oh yeah  He loves them  He's in love with boys  Yeah  He loves his little boys  God am I glad  I don't have that demon  Fuck me man  That would be a bad one  That's a rough demon  And I believe  I'm not excusing  How do you get that demon  Don't know  I imagine abuse victims  Get it  But I don't know  I don't comprehend it  Thank God  Always put your kid  Fucking in writing  Yeah what a brilliant  On Penn State letterhead 
[02:34:00]  On Penn State letterhead  Just in case  You're a bit confused  Free pony rides  Very funny  It's hard to say  That's another Jerry  When it's on Penn State letterhead  Jerry  Eventually as the man  Got older  And acquired a girlfriend  He became basically sick  Of what was happening to me  Oh imagine  He's got a girlfriend  She goes down on him  He's like  No you're not doing it right  Let me show you  Exactly  You have to let me hold a football  While you do it  I can't do it without holding a football  Can I see your picture  Here's a strap on 
[02:34:30]  And a bar of Irish spring  Can I see it  Closer  Oh no  That is nice  John Walsh signed it  Adam Walsh  So he gets the girlfriend  And he distanced himself  From Sandusky  Yeah  They had not spoken  Since 2002  When in 2010  He took his girlfriend  And three year old son  A visit  The Sandusky's  What are you insane  What  Now you're an idiot  Now you're a complete  Fucking idiot  What's going on there  So from 2002  To 2010 
[02:35:00]  He doesn't speak  To Jerry Sandusky  Right  Got this girlfriend  And a three year old son  And he goes to the Sandusky's  And what he said  Was an attempt  To convince his girlfriend  Her suspicions about Sandusky  Were not true  Why would you do that  Wow  It's a weird psychology  Yeah there's something  Going on there  It's just the abused mind  You're protecting him  Why  Yeah  He said that backfired  When Sandusky gave him  A lot of attention  I think him meaning  Not the three year old  I believe  And tried to rub his shoulders 
[02:35:30]  Oh  What  Why would you bring  Your three year old  Over this scene  Maybe you need tickets  What would you do  If you couldn't get tickets  Oh my god  Come on  You just sacrifice  Your kids  You gotta do it  Like look  Hey you wanna take  The kid for some ice cream  I'm going to the game  You wanna watch him  Sure  Sure  Wowie  Kazowie  When is this  When is this  Thing gonna end  I don't know  He's  He's in some trouble 
[02:36:00]  And I'm sure  There's a lot of people  That have to come forward  You think there's more  Testimony coming  Oh yeah  Yeah  More funny testimony  I love trials like this  Soap battles  So  Fucking  It's real life drama  It's kinda cartoony too  Isn't it  Yeah  Cause we don't know  Any of the people  You don't know  Any of the people  So it's not a cartoon  To read about  Soap battles  You're just hearing  A name like  Sandusky  And victim four  And  Showers  And then there was  Another instance 
[02:36:30]  I read about  Sandusky's own son  Was in the fucking  Locker room  And he was  Like talking to his dad  In the shower  Where there's another  Boy with him  And uh  The father started  Sandusky started  Up one of these  Soap fights  And the son  Just turned around  And walked out  Of the locker room  Like uh  So the son  Like he knew  Something was up  Do you think the kid  Ever got molested  By him or no  I don't know  I don't know  Do you molest  Your own kid  I'm sure people do  A lot of people  A lot of people do 
[02:37:00]  I knew someone  I mean I know  If you molest  Your own kid  But was he one of  Those that molested  Other people  But not his own kid  I don't know  It's a fudge  Obviously his kid  Was very aware  Of his father  If he's walking  Away at that point  I know people  Molest their own kids  Thank god for me  How big is this  Shower  How big is this  Fucking shower  Oh it's a  Fucking  Penn State  Penn State locker room  Showers  It's gotta be big  They've been in those  It's big  Showers  It's a huge room 
[02:37:30]  With a bunch of  Shower heads  20 shower heads  So how do you  Justify it  You start out by  You're in one shower  And the kids  Way on the other side  Unless it's one of  Those big showers  That just it's a  Common shower  Without like  Partitions  And you just  Kind of  I remember one of  Those in school  And there was one  Guy  Like it was  I guess it was  Maybe fifth grade  Or something like that  And there was one  Kid that  Like he was  Big dick  And hair  And everything  He's just  Showering up 
[02:38:00]  Didn't care  Because he had  The big dick  I wouldn't give a fuck  I don't think  I had the tiny  Peener back then  And I  I was the guy  Like you  I would go back  To class all sweaty  I wasn't gonna  Shower  Oh you had a little  Peener  I was never  Showered  I developed late  Yeah  I developed around  17, 18  Finally  I just didn't  Want to fucking  Shower  I've heard  Yeah it's pretty  Good  It's tight  It's tight  Here's my question  Though  So why 
[02:38:30]  Was it considered  Normal behavior  For a  Adult to be  Showering with kids  That's all we keep  Hearing  About this Penn State  His defense attorney  Says that Jerry  Came from a  Different time  Where it was  Okay and  Acceptable  Especially in  Sports  I'm just saying  What he said  Especially in  Sports  To have a  Communal shower  Experience after  A game  But that's  Yeah the  Players  Well he's the  Coach and the  Players  It's all the  Same thing 
[02:39:00]  I'm leading to  A question that  Maybe someone out  There could answer  Were you in a  Situation growing up  Where as an  Athlete  You were showering  Obviously with  Other boys  That I know  Happened  I was you know  I was in that  World but you  Never had the  Coach in there  With you  With the  Coach  That's weird  So someone  Please call  If that was  Normal behavior  There's no  Fucking way  That was  Yeah  I don't know  Especially if it was  The chess team  We got a guy  That went to  High school 
[02:39:30]  With victim  Number four  Should we go  With this  I don't believe  It but go ahead  Alright let's  Try it  It's Brett  Who owns  F.H. Reilly's  Oh it can't be him  That's another  Brett I guess  Brett  Hey man what's up  Hey  What's up  This is my  Brother  What's up Brett  No I was just  Calling  I actually went  To high school  With this guy  Yeah  Victim number four  Victim number four  Yeah  And everybody  Thought  Hey this is  Awesome  In junior high 
[02:40:00]  School  That he gets  To hang out  With Jerry  Sandusky  The defensive  Coordinator  For Penn State  And Center  County PA  That's Penn State  Football is it  Oh yeah  And then  As we got  Older  Into senior high  Even we  Kind of thought  You know  The students  That it was  Getting a little  Bit weird  Ah  That this guy  Was picking them  Up from school  A couple times  A week  You know  And then  Even the kid  Himself  Never had  Much good to say 
[02:40:30]  About Sandusky  You know  We'd always  We'd actually  Haggle about it  What's going on  With this guy  You know  And  His balls stink  He would always  Call him an asshole  This guy's an asshole  Yeah this guy's an asshole  He's an asshole  He's in my asshole  Yeah  He's got  He's got  Cumbus  Yeah  His fingers  Are too thick  He puts them  In my hiney  With the ring on  That fucking  Championship ring  Yeah  I hate when  He fingers me  Lefty  You do realize  You're not  Adding much 
[02:41:00]  To the whole  Discussion  Yeah  You kind of  Know the guy  You're just a  Bragger  That you went  To school with him  Yeah  It is kind of  Well you know  He did have  Some insight  You know  We feel  I mean  Me and a buddy  Got together  And we feel  Terrible for  Ragging on this  Kid  You know  In high school  That  You know  Hey man  Is Sandusky  You know  Finger in your asshole  Or showing you  As wiener  And  Now we're all  Kind of feeling  Pretty shitty  About the whole thing  That  This actually  Now we find out

Where are we at with some of these bands coming in to perform this summer?  This is COC, one of the bands we mentioned.  What do we got, Roland? Who's coming in?  The summer of the 90s. 
[03:05:00]  Still waiting on answers from the bands.  Wow.  That means this isn't happening.  I know.  Roland, congratulations on getting one of the first Stanley Cup champions LA Kings t-shirts.  Man, look at you.  You started the day in a Bruce Springsteen shirt.  Yes.  You're ending the show in a LA Kings Stanley Cup champions t-shirt.  Does it itch?  Could you wear that when I'm watching it?  No, man.  My t-shirts have to be real soft.  Super soft.  Super soft.  It looks soft.  No, this is actually a soft.  I have my hand under the shirt.  Now that you're caressing Roland's big arm. 
[03:05:30]  It is actually a softer shirt, but it would still itch me like this part right there.  The patch, Roland.  That shit will make you itch.  How much for the shirt, Roland?  $25.  They're not going to sell a lot of those in New York.  Not a lot of guys are going to go get their LA Kings shirts in the New York area.  Did you get some guy in the street?  No.  Oh.  I get scared.  Did you get frightened?  Yeah.  Did you get frightened?  I don't know.  But you're Mexican.  I know.  Oh, man. 
[03:06:00]  Mexican.  How does he say it?  Mexican.  Mexican.  He puts a T-S in there.  Oh, Mets.  That's right.  That's what it was.  Mexican.  You should have heard NHL store before.  He got it at the NHL store.  It was...  Enchel.  Enchel store.  Enchel store.  Enchel.  Enchel store.  You know, like what?  Where did he get it?  You know, Roland ended up going to the NHL game as well.  The one I went to over the weekend.  Yeah.  He talks so differently when he's outside this place.  Really?  You could understand every single word. 
[03:06:30]  How many is that?  What happens in here, Roland?  What happens?  You get nervous?  Yeah.  Who makes you nervous?  We make you nervous?  Or this place makes you nervous?  Or a combination of both?  No, no.  You guys.  The place.  The place in general?  Like, he has a strong voice outside this place.  Yeah, yeah.  Really strange.  Yeah, because people down there, you gotta go, ah.  See?  People down there, you gotta go, ah.  What does that mean?  People down there, you gotta go, ah.  Roland bails out on thoughts here.  Like, he'll start a thought with no destination.  See, I just wanna... 
[03:07:00]  Well...  It just has a different way of saying things.  Because I understood what he meant, but it's just so weird how he says it that way.  What's up?  What's up?  Can you say that again?  What's up?  Go ahead.  People there...  People there...  People there...  There's some writing going on.  Yeah, that is happening.  Oh, it is?  Okay, when?  Ah, tomorrow.  Are you serious?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, good.  They're...  He said no. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, he did.  No, the rep.  Why?  He said he was busy.  Who?  believe that i mean i believe you because i think he's doing howard from seven to ten  yeah he's like a howard guy no i understand that but he would still i think uh come in if he knew  it was gonna be oh boy we we told him it'd be cool oh boy i was i was acting jimmy i can't even  see i wrote corolla because i just read arnie's tweet that said he's introducing him at his book  event or whatever i'm like why why wouldn't we have him in uh he's doing carolines too he's 
[03:08:00]  doing his podcast there so that's why we thought we'll get him but they say he's busy okay i know  his rep i'll ask him when i see i'll be out there in a month i'll say yeah we're kind of mopping up  here uh lindsey lohan i guess lied to the cops as far as that accident goes she was trying to say  she wasn't driving and now it's obviously uh it's turning out that she obviously was do i hope so  but how many chances are they gonna get this broad she's gonna fucking kill somebody they give her  chance after chance no matter what she does it's la it's la it's fucking none of us could get away 
[03:08:30]  with this not including us we know some people because of what we do and we couldn't get away  with half the shit how many chances away with how many chances it's unbelievable is she still on  probation i don't know can i actually i thought he actually might know yeah so what's the scoop  though what what was the actual story cream you knew she was in a car accident yeah yeah yeah i  knew that but i didn't i guess she was claiming she wasn't driving i guess uh her assistant was 
[03:09:00]  gonna take the hit because maybe because she still does have legal problems maybe she is on probation  or something i don't know i think it was obvious though because if you saw the car the passenger side  was real a lot more fucked than the driver's side and i guess the assistant took a little more  damage than uh lindsey did so uh ergo you would think to wit  yeah that uh she was driving yeah you ever do the switcheroo driving never when you've been in a 
[03:09:30]  situation i haven't either they always figure it out like the people right i like the people that are  like the the guy that's been drinking a little too much is driving and as they're getting pulled  over they're trying to switch seats like the cop can't see right through the fucking i tried it  when i killed billy martin but that was a controversy as far as drivers go i believe they were trying to  say that they were one guy was driving the other guy wasn't billy's head hit the windshield and  that's what killed him i believe yeah so the other guy couldn't explain the head mark of the windshield 
[03:10:00]  right yeah unbelievable yeah poor billy drunk driving accident uh i lost one to that shit  you can't fucking drive around drunk there kids fraternity brother man fucking brutal stay home  was it his fault or someone else was he drunk or they were uh i got a lot of my guys listening uh  you know he he might have had a few on the way home from a couple a couple of wobbly pops i won't  mention his name it was a real did he kill anyone else no but good thing he had some road sodas yeah 
[03:10:30]  he lived with a very swollen head for a day or two brain swelling killed you right i killed him i  believe so yeah oh i thought he was very proud of himself i really love this kid that's just not a  nice person you just stink i'm a terrible terrible person enough years have gone by i guess how about  some coffee on his linen shirt would that make you feel bad oh god it's all right i already wrecked 
[03:11:00]  it why are you wearing a linen shirt today it's very nice but i'm just i know why he's wearing it  but i won't say oh because you're a douche i like how you said i won't say say no because i figured  you'd fire one out before i had a chance he fucking stepped on me uh no i um i was when i was going to  the bathroom the fucking doorknob caught right in oh really and ripped it oh jeez oh jeez 
[03:11:30]  ah what you gonna do oh jeez god that's the shirt you know i've never seen a more fucking coffee  throw on a bullshark oh yeah it really just yells for a big stain yeah uh you know when erock was  getting topical he missed the obvious one today and we still haven't mentioned it and we're almost  done for today have to do it florida it's the whole reason we're together as a radio show oh  happened 18 years ago today 18 years ago today yep uh that was i remember oh turn this up oh my god

[03:29:30]  the one i don't like yeah there's the other one all right it's time to play what did you learn  you can call us up at 866 wow one wow we're gonna start with connor connor what did you learn on  today's show last time i asked you the answer was nothing yeah no i drew a blank last time you're one of  the new interns you should be learning every day that's part of a part of the reason you earn  college credit for an internship is because what it is when he boils down to it is a learning 
[03:30:00]  experience so every day you know if you go to if you go to uh uh geography and i said what did you  learn today you could be like oh i learned where antarctica is something like that right this is just  like that you know what i mean so what did you learn today on the opian anthony show i learned  today that the op curse can be beaten okay that's very good that's very good connor you pass you get  an a minus for today i'll take it congratulations webbed toad rob we met you more intimately yesterday 
[03:30:30]  your toes are stuck together they are what did you learn on today's show i learned that oj simpson  could get out in 2018 no that doesn't count because he learned that at the end of the show  at the end of the show you're right dan i don't like the post 9 30 i don't like the end of the  show what did you learn call us up and prove these guys wrong a66 wow one wow and tell me what you  learned i learned the show wait wait plus that's wrong it's 2017 oh god i want to get before you  give rob any clues i want to know what rob actually learned i learned today because i was about to 
[03:31:00]  compliment eroc on his interns but right now he's 50 50. well i learned that woody allen and  chip or friends okay i'll take it i'll take it that's something that's good uh it's a b minus  no it's a c plus because it's not it wasn't like it wasn't as good as his like he actually  what connor did was he took some information and he formed it into a reel you just spouted out some  bullshit yeah so eric have you do you feel like the interns are back on track after what happened 
[03:31:30]  yesterday yeah i think these two are not bad did you have to talk to him um to get him on track i mean  no the the one we did have to talk to he's not here today you had to talk to the other one yeah  a little bit did you get in trouble with uh yesterday's interneetics no you were worried  that you were going to oh well he showed up well somebody showed up right when you started your show  you said he a minute ago as if saying he was giving it away it's not a specific now you know 
[03:32:00]  it's a boy or a girl no i didn't i was trying that he didn't mean the intern he meant  scary management yeah we were talking about him yesterday it's not a secret he's fine with it i  think yeah he's fine he showed up during when your show started we talked and everything's fine  that was it that was it so what were you so scared of because his emails were he he wasn't um  liking the egghead comments he's got you shook nagel don't he you think he's got him shook travis  yes yes yes he does all right thank you interns you go answer the phones because other people want 
[03:32:30]  to play what did you learn not just you guys uh danny what did you learn on today's opian anthony  show i learned that there will never be an in and out burger in new york that was what you learned  during the break all right well before the show started i learned that if you're going to molest a  baby you need to make sure that your penis fits through the crib bars that's right uncle uncle paul  and what was just so disturbing about uncle paul today is that he did the voice of the person  yelling at him and you could hear someone saying paul get your dick out between the crib bars 
[03:33:00]  so gross i'm so happy that having a child hasn't diminished my love for uncle paul yeah you still  enjoy it that's just there i was commenting in the back that it's like uh you know no one's gonna sit  here and realistically think that molesting a baby is a good time no it's a bad thing if you have the  kind of humor where you listen to a joke like that and you can't laugh hysterically i just don't  want you in my life i just don't need to know you i also loved that the characters started morphing 
[03:33:30]  into his real life when jim saw coco jones who i guess is like a disney channel star who's the  daughter of a football player um named mike jones and she was with her father jim thought they must be  boyfriend girlfriend and he was talking about how beautiful uh she was and how much he wanted to kiss  her we looked her up on wikipedia she's 14 years old she is 14 years old uh jim apologized immediately  for his um discretions trucker bob what did you learn on the opian anthony show 
[03:34:00]  trucker bob hang on all right sorry wait wait i didn't have your button pushed now you can tell me  what you learned i learned it when aunt says he's got a shit it's not up for discussion or negotiation  god tell you what trucker bob aunt does not shit very often usually even during the commercial breaks  he just sits right here in this studio but jay moore called in and as jay moore called in  aunt needed to defecate and as we learned today when that boy has to go that boy has to go so 
[03:34:30]  you could have in essence said uh i learned on the show today that jay moore makes anthony have to shit  if that was the reason sure i mean that is a hypothesis but would that have been something  that i learned on the show is that an acceptable answer judges i would accept it travis what he's  not listening yes i would accept he's not listening i heard exactly he thinks he's back in the office  while the regular show is on he's watching clips of vader from monday night raw he's not listening  he's not listening to the show whatsoever um yeah and you could say that the jay moore makes anthony 
[03:35:00]  after shit it would be an acceptable what did you learn i don't know if it's accurate i mean i don't  think you'd win a book but you know right yeah i wouldn't give you a sign bear grills book or  something but i might give you a guy fieri item uh rich in buffalo yeah you guys just touched on  something that i always think about it that anybody's rich in buffalo i can laugh hysterically at  uh uncle paul and then i stop and think about it and go wait a minute this is like awful you know 
[03:35:30]  what a fucking asshole this guy is i know well but what's funny i think what makes it acceptable  is that jim will if we're talking about a child molestation story jim will morph in and out so  one moment you'll have norton who's appalled by this person who molested a kid and then the next  moment he's morphed into uncle paul who's relating to this guy and then the next moment he's back to  norton being appalled so it's like okay i got the guy who's appalled so i don't it's okay to laugh at 
[03:36:00]  this at this character and plus he takes it out to such an extreme level i think and that's where  oh yeah i think i think when uncle paul turned the corner is when he started mentioning his penis  and dropping all subtleties from his act it used to be all just implied molestation now it's just like  yeah what i do is i have the little baby touch my penis yeah i remember like a couple of years ago it's  like oh sure i used to take care of you when you were a kid now it's like oh you used to put your 
[03:36:30]  little lips on my balls yeah yeah it's like what you can't say that jeff what did you learn on the  show i learned that a transvestite will cup your balls to make their cock look bigger cup their balls  to make their cock yeah yeah yeah that's true they got all kinds of tricks these transvestites  luke in massachusetts hey what's up i learned uh that eric is a dummy i already knew that from uh  from twitter because he blocked me a while ago but why'd he block you huh why did he block you 
[03:37:00]  i have no idea why do you think what kind of stuff do you say about eric on twitter he didn't make it  there within 30 or less hey do you work for dominoes eric do you block people from dominoes  no no hotlines ringing in there somebody pick up the hotline say that again luke  yeah it's just busting balls i'm luke using force by the way hi danny what's up bud eric why did you  why did you block luke do you suppose who the fuck knows why do you how many people have you blocked  yeah like honest question i'm not shitting on you i just because you probably catch more shit 
[03:37:30]  i i get yelled at because oh audible wasn't up on time i have nothing to do by the way by the way  let me tell you something everybody who's been messaging me telling me that the show from audible  isn't up on friday i've been forwarding all those to you yeah thanks for that i don't care okay i sent  them the show on friday i sent it to him again on monday morning i don't work for audible yeah so if  the show is not up on audible i could care less and that's true i understand that you want to  listen to the show i want you to listen to the show i think audible is a great service i don't 
[03:38:00]  work for them no maybe you should send him an email no no no uh uncle paul hargus is on the phone  i don't like the fact you're misrepresenting me i'm not misrepresenting you uncle paul  trump bottom danny over there saying i said this and that i didn't say none of those things you've  gone on the air and you specifically mentioned baby hands on your penis there's a nun  there's a nun who's looking into the studio right now there's three old women and one of 
[03:38:30]  them is a nun and we're talking about uncle paul molesting babies yeah she's probably a big  tall tale meanwhile she's spanking everybody with a ruler nobody's checking to see if she's  damping her you know what well either way it's a terrible thing to do why don't you shut up  no why don't you shut up you make a lot of people uncomfortable you're a little potty man  and your father used to call me over and say sam's misbehaving can you straighten him out 
[03:39:00]  so you're get right in there in your little hulkamaniac outfit no uncle paul my father never  punished me through molestation yeah he did he say hey paul why don't you give sam the world's greatest  treat and then you'd be rolling around on your belly for three days sam don't  sam you obviously don't remember when paul took you on that wrestling outing when you went to see  the big show yeah we'd only have one chair and sam would have to bounce in my lap up down up down 
[03:39:30]  yay the hulkaman yay the hulkaman you can come home and reenact some of the wrestling matches that  scene yeah here comes king kong brady yay everybody's wrestling don't i don't like you  slandering me i'll sue you if you keep saying i had baby hands all over my penis  i didn't say nothing about little soft cuddly baby hands on my penis cupping it like expert 
[03:40:00]  i heard something about cupping it like expert first of all you you called a four-year-old a lady today  i didn't think nothing about none of them little raffle shaking hands expertly moving back and forth  over my genitals i didn't say that you're putting words in my mouth didn't i hear something about  about your penis going through crib bars i was trying to hang something on the mobo and i had my shorts  and it fell through it ain't my fault that kid saw it when oh look a candy factory or whatever it was 
[03:40:30]  you don't touch he said the the kid was going for it like a hamster to a water bottle  yeah paul i didn't know what to do i gotta go i'm in the car  goodbye uncle paul  that's just disgusting what did you learn on the show today eric  uh well that color already gave it away but uh paul  no the one before that you learned that babies touch penises like experts no the hood documentary 
[03:41:00]  was in florida yeah uh matter of fact let's go to mark in queens who also learned something similar  what's up mark oh oh oh you just lost that you lost your chance um yeah eric why did you why  were you convinced that that documentary was in california obviously i heard did you realize  at the top of the show did you realize that when you said actually it's in california  that that would be a theme that haunted you for the next four hours no 
[03:41:30]  now what made you think it was in california for the video while you were playing it and i heard orange  county so i just automatically yeah they did orange county florida no they said orange county and i  automatically assumed it was california you know what happens when you assume right  yeah you get told four hours you make a complete ass out of yourself  you'd think you'd know more about florida at this point you'd think you're the resident expert of  the ona staff oh boy kevin in texas hey guys how y'all doing yeah i had the uh unfortunate or 
[03:42:00]  fortunate incident either way i've had a guy from my corporate office riding with me one day and  turned on the radio like normal and uncle paul is on so needless to say that the corporate guy  looking at me like i'm a fucking creep was an understatement but we did get a new listener  and he really enjoyed the show and you have to sit there and try to explain to a person who doesn't  know the show no no no it's a character for seven hours yeah it never works out anyway punch it out 
[03:42:30]  boys um okay what are you laughing at travis just you know uncle paul uncle paul  yep you have a daughter and you can still find the humor it's hysterical what if you specifically  started bringing up your daughter though probably he only speaks to my daughter as uncle paul oh  when we're over at anthony's house when we first when we traveled to comic con last year  every single young person every single child every toddler that we passed on this street 
[03:43:00]  he would say hello to them by name hello author hello janelle um tina in california california  what part are you from miami california close orange county what's up tina um i learned that  when i come to new york i need to order extra sauce on my pizza extra sauce okay whoever's 
[03:43:30]  screening phone calls yeah i saw that whoever's screening phone calls wrote that tina learned that  when you i learned when you come to new york i learned that you need to order extra socks  who's screening phone calls your favorite intern okay bring rob in here no not him  are you kidding me the one who messed up with yesterday i'm gonna go all right let's start  to connor about phone screening i want to know why that makes sense exactly that's the question 
[03:44:00]  that's the question to ask that's what used to happen like with some of our other phone screeners  i would see them write something and i would say what does that mean no no and they would say i  don't know and i'd say well then why would you put it up on the screen okay connor you had a rough  day yesterday correct yeah i did i'll admit to that yeah i completely fucked up yesterday and today  comes robbing his webbed toes running up the hall to pick up the slack um he's trying not to catch  uh air that's a problem when he starts running now you wrote that uh the latina who called in to say  you have to order extra sauce because that's what opie said for his pizza um he said that when you 
[03:44:30]  come to new york you have to order extra socks is that what you thought she said that's honestly  what i thought she said okay now what sense does that make i don't know i've been listening to i've  been uh listening to worst of clips and organizing that all day so i didn't really get a chance to  listen to all the show so i thought it was just something that i need a phone screener who is  confident that they know more about the show than the caller like i don't need the caller being able  to convince the phone screener no i swear to god you missed it they did a great bit about socks today 
[03:45:00]  because if she was saying if she was indeed saying you know i learned you have to order extra socks  i'd be like what are you talking about and she'd be like baba booey and i'd be like what happened  you know what i mean all right that's part of phone screening you have to screen it's not it's not  you're not the receptionist yeah you don't put everybody through right right you have to just  screen through these people who are talking about socks all day because i don't want to sit on  after opening anything live and talk with anybody about socks you know what i mean because what does 
[03:45:30]  that have to do with anything i just bought the best socks like i would have thrown danny out of  the studio i would have been like who's talking about socks today right so you can't have tina  tricking you and saying yeah sam called me earlier in the week and said i should call in today about  socks and you're like okay and put her on because you're connor the call screener you have the power  of hanging up on people do you hang up on people when you're screening calls yeah like what would  you hang up on what's the call you you would or or have hung up on uh i like um just as an example 
[03:46:00]  like if somebody like i can't hear what they're saying like there's a lot of wind or they refuse  to turn on the radio it's a bad phone so as long as they're audible you get through you don't have  to say any shit of any substance well those are just instantly dumb okay hold on for those that don't  know when you call the show when you call the open anthony show when you call after open anthony live you  have to go through one of us or one of the interns before you can get on the live show 
[03:46:30]  and the purpose of that is supposed to be so they weed out those calls that just add nothing to the  show now sometimes you can still sneak through and add nothing in the case sometimes you can get  through talking about socks yeah there's eight shit coming in here yeah i know what happened how to  taste it tasted terrific what's going on sal no nothing i just want to say that i um the people who call in  about socks to the no just to the opening anthony show in general you said the name wrong what are  you a fucking rookie because i'm fucking catching my breath for fucking dying on this goddamn fucking 
[03:47:00]  opening anthony are back in the news no but just it is it is a very difficult thing to deal with the  people who call into ona yeah but you if somebody called up and said hey sal uh i would like to talk  to sam and what i learned today was that when you come to new york you need an extra pair of socks  wouldn't you be like i'd be like that's great i'd hang up on them immediately or i wouldn't even  say that i just hang up on right you hang up and you go to the next call you got those buttons by  the way you could just be you could just there's nothing wrong with saying to the caller like i don't 
[03:47:30]  get it and then they'll explain it and then you go oh okay then you put them through right that's  there's there's there's always you'd say well what do you mean socks what are you talking about i love  when danny answers the phones well danny once got kicked off danny was once suspended from call  screening for like years because he calls listeners once suspended for years yeah like  he couldn't call screen for years that's when i took over because one of the listeners complained  that the phone screener had called them a cunt that was danny wrong a lot of you guys are cunts  out there and you know it so that's another thing connor this is another thing that you're learning 
[03:48:00]  today don't don't call people cunts if somebody says i'm a cunt if somebody calls up if you have  an inkling in your head that goes the guy on the phone is a cunt he's a cunt no but don't tell  him that if somebody calls up and says hey i want to talk to sam about socks don't be like  don't be a cunt he doesn't want to talk about socks today just be like i don't know why you  would think that that was an appropriate call and hang up you're saying there's like a happy medium  there's something in between between putting them on the air listen up cunt nobody's talking about 
[03:48:30]  socks look at the people and look at the quality of call that you get on this radio show you have to  you have to handle people like that you're going to get calls about socks you got a hang up button you  could just hit the button and then they're out of your lives forever you don't have to you know  who's telling me you don't have to make a guy who's never screened calls for the show before i have  absolutely well here here's the thing you don't have to make them pay when you first start screening  phone calls and this this happened to me too you know like you forget that that you really do have  you have a lot of power and you're never going to see or hear these people again so like yeah it's 
[03:49:00]  not a it's not a personal thing if they don't have something good to say it's it's your job to to  screen them out and if somebody doesn't have something good you say all right thanks man and you  hang up but you never think about it again sometimes sometimes when you're trying to like  if you got a good topic and phones lit up like crazy and you're trying to get everybody on or  you're trying to at least get as many good ones in there as fast as possible so that the hosts can  have uh you know just a huge bank of phones to go to it you know at any time so sometimes someone  will call in you have to make that decision that split decision is this good enough and you go all  right man thanks and you hang up on them right and then and that's fine but then here's when 
[03:49:30]  someone's a cunt when they call when they fucking call back and they go  and i'm like i'm like yeah i heard your call and i didn't think it was good enough so  i hung up on you i mean that that's always going to be problem is that then you get hung then you  get all right dude and you hang up again and now this fucking guy is going to have at it with you  for 30 minutes just busting your balls because you didn't put your shit phone call through  and as if you don't recognize the fucking phone number as it's coming in they just call back here's 
[03:50:00]  another one i love you got a fucking you got you got 13 lines lit down a line right and then some  guy i guess his phone cuts out or op hangs up on him or whatever and then the guy calls back uh you  had my phone cut out i specifically remember everything about you and your name no you dude i  don't know your name i don't know every time anybody ever said yeah my phone cut out i would  always say tell me again what was your call and as they were saying it button push see i never i never  ever yelled at any of the people calling in it's just like okay they're like hey man you hung up 
[03:50:30]  on me okay what was it that you have click as they're saying it sometimes hang up sometimes you  are the first round of the screen process but then the last round of the screening process inevitably  takes place in here in this studio in that chair so sometimes when you get hung up on it's not the  screener it's the host he doesn't want to go to your call don't call back about yeah i'm a phone  connect no it was decided that your call was not worth it then why'd you hang up unless if you're ever on  hold and then all of a sudden out of nowhere right your call is ended don't fucking call back 
[03:51:00]  unless your phone legitimately cuts out in which case we may want to get to your call so you got  to make sure of that too so maybe you call back and just check with connor and just tell him you  want to talk about undergarments he'll throw you right through yeah you were doing worse stuff they  talked about it earlier you got it buddy um so that's what people are going to start doing now now  they know that connor didn't hear the show so they're just going to call maybe we should make yeah eric  from now on can you make an announcement at the top of the show that it's a connor day  you can get through with whatever the fuck as long as long as you're audible on the phone 
[03:51:30]  you can get through will do okay i think you don't want any more audible calls oh danny anthony  good morning boys what's up today on the show that i've learned at the phone screener we'll hang  up on you three times with useful information for the show you got hung up on three times when they  were talking about the gang this morning i wanted to tell the boys who was talking about who was the  call screener while the show was on gangland judge anthony i understand now you can see why i got  hung up who was who was the screener while the main show was on uh that would be rob okay uh 
[03:52:00]  rob yeah have rob get on that mic or come in here or something because i want i would like i like when  the when the people who got hung up on get to talk to the connor don't you go anywhere you're still  learning all right what's up he tried to sneak out you're still learning what do you say um all right  yeah and eric you can get phone all right yeah the phone screener is now here anthony so anthony  you're saying that you got hung up on by rob three times today correct rob why would you hang up on  anthony three times well what did he say what did he say what did he say i was calling this morning 
[03:52:30]  about the gang that they were talking about i was trying to tell him where they were from and they  were actually featured on gangland was it california no it was not okay because like 30 people call in  right before and tell you where it's from and i put two in in there and then all right we get it  they're from florida that's a great example rob's got a great point because sometimes people call in  and they think that they have exclusive information they think they're first yeah they don't realize  that we've gotten that call 30 times already so yeah i'm gonna hang up on you your information 
[03:53:00]  is good but i've gotten it but yeah i've gotten it 20 times already but when you get when you get to  the point when you say oh i've got it i've got it and they're still trying to figure it out for the  next 10 minutes uh that's not that's not the screener's problem you're on a delay and anthony  i'm gonna let you in on something sometimes the answer is directly in front of you on the call  screen but you don't pick up the call because that would end the conversation and what we do here is  have conversations if we immediately if we were to explain radio to the fans so that they don't get 
[03:53:30]  their feelings hurt now anthony do you accept unbelievable do you accept rob the intern's  excuse or do you feel like he had a personal vendetta and let's be frank he's only in his  second week of his internship maybe he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing would it sound better if  we just blame it on eroc i don't think that's fair oh punch it out boys have a good day oh he gave up  can i say one other thing there are other ways to get in touch with the show right  instant feedback what you could tweet you could tweet the guys if you tweet opie yeah there's 
[03:54:00]  that's a much more direct way if you want your message to languish and fucking stagnation yeah  then use instant feedback no no i understand i'm just saying though but like people call in if  god forbid opie misses a date a wrong or something like that or he's like oh this was june 7 blah blah  blah yeah and then it's really it was actually june you literally literally the next 30 calls will be  people uh june 8 june 8 that's like oh my fucking god like we don't do like like opie probably knows 
[03:54:30]  he knows and it's a lot of times to correct yourself would actually slow the show down more  than just to let it go right you know what i mean like you don't always need it's part of a bit or  something like just opie said am it's actually eric did you pick up line four no the one that says i  like it oh okay no i just want to know who wrote that uh chuck in chicago yeah i called up to tell  how cool they redid the uh u-boat submarine uh display at the museum and he hung up on me that 
[03:55:00]  guy's a fucking idiot get him off the phones all right rob you wrote i like it on this call  i liked it too you did you know it's fun i mean i got what he was trying to do anyway yeah but it  didn't it didn't it didn't come off like it was like what wait what because he goes rob get back  to the phone i want to talk to you it didn't work it didn't work that's the last time i don't care  what you like okay you are a zero judge of content good call good call no it's not yeah next time put a 
[03:55:30]  lot of asterisks on that one hey rob the next time you write your opinion on that phone screen  you're fired period line three i don't want you writing i don't want to know what rob i don't  want to know what your opinion is i just want to make sure that your toes are still stuck together  glenn the trucker hey sam you're kind of said too much thank you i'm just calling to say fuck you  all you should appreciate us call us a little bit more well i do glenn to tell you the truth i really do 
[03:56:00]  can i give you can i give you a uh what did i want of course you can the um gorillas in  pennsylvania it's a fine documentary that was made take off of uh gorillas in the mist i don't even  know what you're talking about i'm so happy you took that call thank you thank you how come in one  moment glenn says you guys really need to treat us with more respect and then the next moment he's  talking about something going on in pennsylvania i don't know he's talking about shit caller and 
[03:56:30]  everybody who calls for some reason is entitled to have their call on the air and if it bombs it  wasn't their fault ladies and gentlemen one of the greatest interns of all time you've heard him on  after open anthony live before one of travis's favorites too bobby the champ is on the phone  what's up ptsr all right bob you screen calls yeah for ron and fez yeah now now ron and fez i will  say this ron and fez in terms of phone screening is more demanding than opian anthony phone screening  because ron and fez is much more quick paced with the phones and they use the phones much more so 
[03:57:00]  it's a much more important element to that show it's a lot of pressure now they do have a lot of  sharp really sharp callers yes they do have some of the dumbest dumbest okay and see that's something  that we always talk about like the ona staff has been in the office before and been like god damn how  do ron and fez get such good callers well it's all the phone screening obviously you think so  you're you guys know bobby folded them all it's all bobby bobby's like you know what i don't like 
[03:57:30]  that call here's what you say and you're just feeding all the colors different great clever lines  the worst part though is like dealing with the idiots is fine and everything right but when ron  gives you that look of what are you doing when phone banks are filling up like literally look goes  right through you and you feel like you're two inches tall it's what do you mean the phone banks  are you mean you're not answering them quick enough not answering them quick enough or not getting  through them or like a bad call gets through okay what would the look if ron bennington picked up a  phone call that said he wants to say when you go to new york you need extra socks what look would 
[03:58:00]  ron bennington give you see the thing is there's one of two ways if he would either turn it and make  it hilarious and make fun of you obviously or just give you a look that's so inside because obviously no one  sees it's radio but you feel it it just it goes right through you it goes through your soul the  look of like how why are you ruining the show like you're just sitting there and you're going not  only am i not cut out for this i'm not cut out for anything anything in life i think i'd be afraid 
[03:58:30]  to work for oh i would never want to work for for ron and fez was it what was it well actually you  know you have a very interesting perspective bobby because you interned for ron and fez and for the  opian anthony show yep the ron and fez internship much more demanding uh yes you would say that  yeah i mean i the ona one is a lot more demeaning yeah but um yeah i will how what is the difference  because you this is what you dealt with jay more never sat naked on your face for ron and fez  this is this is what you what what is better what is worse what is tougher for you to deal with 
[03:59:00]  the inside whereas ron is going to look at you and give you a look that tears apart your soul  but it's not on the air nobody knows it's happening except you but it's just so intense and personal  or when you come on the opian anthony side of things and the host don't even really acknowledge  you but they'll give you a nod hello unless you do something wrong as in your case when you played 
[03:59:30]  with anthony's megaphone and he completely demolished you on the air like he didn't give  you a look that just pierced your soul he tore you apart limb from limb what is a harder thing to  deal with see i i think i put it in perspective here so with ron fez ron always put you on the air  and he made it good radio and he put you over right he made you feel like you're a million bucks  um but also if you screwed up like you would you would find out about it but you also crave to be 
[04:00:00]  on air and you crave to um do better and make better radio whereas on a you were like ah let  me just harden the computer today please don't call me in let me just make it to 10 o'clock bobby  it's still like that it really is you know i'm just sitting there at the computer in the studio and  i'm just like please please let them be on a roll for the next four hours because the minute i mean  they're on a roll the minute they're not on a roll they look and they look huh or if they're even if  they're still on a roll and it's just starting to slow down they're like what the fuck are you 
[04:00:30]  doing behind that computer sam hey sam can i tell a story about the funniest thing that happened in  my entire internship i hope you do actually we should put him back on hold and he should be  rescreened i don't know rob will be like i don't know as long as you guys this is gonna be really  funny i don't want rob's opinion i trust bobby more than i trust rob so now this is one of the  most inside stories and this shows how much of a genius ron is okay comedically so every year 
[04:01:00]  people call up i don't know why when it's the birthday of the u.s marine corps it's older than  the united states apparently i don't know i don't know why it's important but they call up it's the  birthday of the marine corps now harry obviously you remember harry harry t was harry t was the  ron and fez producer before when he there was east side dave who used to work here before east side  dave was harry t now a lot of people don't know this i don't even know if you know this bobby 
[04:01:30]  but harry t and sam roberts were in the same opie and anthony internship class wow that's right  so harry t at this time was the producer for ron and fez yeah and he was my quote unquote mentor even  know i got over on him and paulie because they were probably oh you had trumpet voice paulie in  your class i can't drink all that okay i was i was the first ron and fez intern on uh xm that's  so all right so what so what happens so basically this is completely off air someone calls in with 
[04:02:00]  it and harry's on the phones and he hangs up on the caller who says it and thinks like oh look i got  this great piece of information okay so it's the u.s marine corps birthday yeah and harry hangs up  on the guy and takes credit for it yeah he writes on a note runs into the studio passes it to ron  ron looks at him gives him the look of death write something on the piece of paper he comes back into  the booth with his head like literally it hung he looks miserable he hands us the note and basically 
[04:02:30]  it was me and and crazy bill in the in the booth it says buy a cake and eat it  and it wasn't on the air at all he just he's in the middle of a show and harry thinks he's like  all right i'm gonna steal this information from this caller and ron wrote the words buy a cake and eat it  earl had to shut off the microphone in in the booth because me and bill didn't stop laughing for 
[04:03:00]  like five or six minutes oh that's awesome god dude remember that dude remember those days it  was bobby the champ trumpet voice paulie earl douglas how does this get better bill wild bill  wild bill oh my god i miss this what was this 2007 holy fuck where'd all the time go thank you bobby  2005 2005 jesus thanks buddy bye shit i like the bobby still on board though and he's still  i watched that fucking kid chug like a 40 ounce of orange juice and boof it all up into a garbage can 
[04:03:30]  boom fucking paulie paulie the entire yeah he was supposed to yeah because like the i think what the  story how the story went was like he was supposed to get as his orange juice and he kept fucking it up  so they made him like go out and get like the biggest tub of like freshly squeezed orange juice  that they could find and they made him sit there and drink it all right i wonder if we can do that  today and then he tried slowing it down and i think like ronald kept going hey you're not drinking your 
[04:04:00]  juice or whatever within 20 minutes paulie was just throwing up all over the place and then he never  fucked up this is oj ever again what's up rich rich in florida hey hey how y'all doing the reason why  we call i think is because we think that y'all are going to say oh that's clever now i'm going to be  the new go-to guy to the show and eventually y'all are going to invite us up there uh does that really  go in does that really go out in your mind like you're thinking like first it's going to be like 
[04:04:30]  oh rich from florida and you're going to have one good call you're going to call again and have  another one all of a sudden rich from florida is a regular caller and eventually they got to meet  this guy who's so great and then and then uh and and then who's the caller on the phone and then rich  rich and anthony are just poolside clinking clinking beer glasses together it's like hey what do you  feel like doing it want to watch a movie well rich and everybody else i'm gonna make this let's go to  fh doesn't hit the dump button i'm gonna make this abundantly clear there's only one coke logic  and he's spoken for coke logic to me has the title of number one number one caller fan i think it's all 
[04:05:00]  coke logic because and he's had it for a long time and he's he's a good caller he's creative  he comes up with good stuff and he doesn't overdo it i was about to say verbatim what you just said  so you're saying better than bobo he beat out bobo yes he did yes he did unless thank you rich  that's why i've heard that we are gonna do um this chicago pizza thing because gary came in and 
[04:05:30]  opie was very excited because he told opie you can get pizza delivery from chicago they send it on dry  ice and so i think we're gonna do this however opie off the air had another idea and since bobo is doing  this new chicago bobo character i don't know if he debuted it on the air or not but it's just bobo  saying chicago things you probably figured that out um we're actually gonna have bobo  on his own dime uh go to chicago and pick up the pizza for us so that's gonna be really fun 
[04:06:00]  i can't wait to get that done i'm just glad that we got bo back on the show yeah so connor um do you  feel like because opie said yesterday he doesn't think that these interns are experienced enough to  be a call screener obviously and i hate to say this eric has not been a good teacher as far as call  screening goes worst intern boss ever i think that's true i mean eric that's fair right i would  say in turn in connor's case this is two days in a row obviously you are not good at teaching call  screening no i think i'm fine no i wouldn't say so because so far two show hosts two on-air hosts 
[04:06:30]  on this channel have had a problem with your intern what did eric tell you when it was time to screen  calls for the first time get on there and hit the button so so that's how you answer and then  there's this uh thing with all the letters and any of the ladies pass them through to the sex bagel  do you feel like you've learned through listening to all of our experiences a little more about call  screening um i think it was more of a trial by fire type of thing so you haven't learned anything 
[04:07:00]  sitting no i listening to these stories no i have but like i think mistakes i could also like  chalk up to nerves nerves you're in there you're not in here what's nervous in there you're talking  to some schlubs here what lady trucker is a celebrity no there's still a big show is it it's not the big  show no it's not the big show no it's the largest athlete in the world are you kidding me um it is a  big show it's probably it's it may be the biggest show in all of radio as a matter of fact there's not  many shows bigger than the opian anthony show however that doesn't mean you can let calls about socks 
[04:07:30]  on the air that just doesn't make any sense whatsoever when was the last time you heard a  great sock bit on the after show when was the last time you heard a sock bit you should have said i  don't think i've ever heard a great bit on the after show hello i believe we've had mcfoley in the  studio that's true that would have made sense okay but save the next sock haul for mcfoley and i want  you to really think about everything that we've taught you today okay connor yeah okay i'm glad we had 
[04:08:00]  this conversation ron and fez are coming up next hopefully ron will write a hilarious note to an  intern that you will hear about seven years later until then and hopefully they could find an excuse  to replay that whole paulie yeah i hope they were listening and they're they have a nice best of  plan uh for next time they're out ron and fez are live next we'll be back with more of this tomorrow  goodbye everybody hopey anthony show is now over for real this time </pre>
