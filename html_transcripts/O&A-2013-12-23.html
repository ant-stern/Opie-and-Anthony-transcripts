<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's "Worst of 2013" broadcast, hosted by E-Rock in the absence of Opie and Anthony (returning January 6th, 2014), was a retrospective of the year's highlights.  The show began with Opie recounting a chaotic day involving his three-year-old son smashing their 65-inch TV with a T-ball after consuming excessive chocolate, then taking an unsupervised elevator ride down 20 floors.

James Lipton, of *Inside the Actors Studio*, was a guest. He discussed his career, the Actors Studio Drama School, and anecdotes from his interviews, including Jack Lemmon's confession about alcoholism.  Lipton shared a personal story about working as a "mech" (a tour guide facilitating sexual encounters for American tourists) in 1950s Paris due to financial hardship. He compared French and American attitudes towards sex. He also discussed his experiences with Marlon Brando and other actors.  Charles Ramsey (the Cleveland kidnapping rescuer) and Moses Gates (Opie's urban exploration partner) were also mentioned, along with Jim Norton's recurring character.

A significant portion focused on Charles Ramsey, playing clips from his numerous media interviews after rescuing the Cleveland kidnapping victims.  The hosts highlighted inconsistencies in his accounts (e.g., whether he recognized Amanda Berry), his frequent McDonald's mentions, and his casual use of offensive language ("bitches," "nigga").  They compared his interviews to those related to the Jaycee Dugard case, discussing law enforcement failures in both situations.  This segment transitioned to a discussion of Mars, a show contributor, and his abusive childhood. Mars detailed instances of physical abuse from his mother, including being burned with a hot spatula, and her narcissistic behavior.  The segment returned to Charles Ramsey's interviews, emphasizing his colorful language and McDonald's references.

Mars further detailed his abusive childhood, including physical abuse from his mother and his father's lack of intervention. He discussed the challenges of maintaining a relationship with his abusive mother while protecting his children.  The hosts then reacted with outrage (using the term "cunt" repeatedly) to a video showing a mother getting her baby tattooed.  They discussed the cycle of abuse.  A call-in segment featured Ken from Chicago, who shared a similar experience and his decision to cut contact with his abusive parents.  Mars shared additional anecdotes, including encounters with a transvestite family friend ("Wonder Woman") and the family's unusual toilet habits. The hosts also discussed an upcoming trip to Radio Row at the Super Bowl.

A later segment delved deeper into Mars's childhood abuse, with discussions about different implements used for corporal punishment and its long-term effects. Troy Kwan joined the studio for this discussion.  Moses Gates, an urban explorer, then joined the show. He recounted his urban exploration adventures with Opie, including trips into the tunnels beneath the West Side Highway and the Chrysler Building. They discussed the risks and myths surrounding urban exploration in New York City.

Moses, author of "Hidden Cities," further detailed his worldwide urban exploration experiences, including climbing skyscrapers, exploring the Paris catacombs, a near-arrest in Russia after exploring the Naglinka River, climbing an Egyptian pyramid, and exploring Stonehenge. He discussed the changing accessibility of these locations. The segment concluded with a comedic bit involving Jim Norton's fictional police drama character, "The Mongoose,"  a destructive but ultimately good-hearted cop.  The bit included reading from the script and detailing the character's backstory.  The segment ended with promotional information for the show and its social media channels.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admission. James Lipton. A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shit face buffoonery. E-Rock drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry. And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers up my ass. What the fuck happened?  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  No.  It's the worst of 2013 for the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is E-Rock and the show is off for the next couple of weeks. 
[00:00:30]  Returning January 6th, 2014.  But until then, looking back at the year that was for the Opie and Anthony show.  And a lot to get through.  We've got some good stuff coming up today.  James Lipton will be in studio.  Charles Ramsey, you may remember him for discovering those girls who've been kidnapped so many years ago up in Cleveland.  Mars tells the story about abusive mothers and we all get into that.  But Moses Gates comes to the show talking about all his urban exploring he did with Opie. 
[00:01:00]  And Norton's got yet another character that we are going to meet if you haven't done so already.  But we're going to start everything off here with Opie's son having a little adventure in his apartment building.  I guess Opie went to go do something in the building and left the kid at home.  But the kid opened the door and went looking for daddy.  And here it is, Opie's son on a big adventure in the big city here on the Worst of 2013.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013. 
[00:01:30]  So then I go home and my kid is starting to feel better.  So he's like, his energy is back.  So he's fucking rocking around the apartment.  He wants to be outside.  And I'm sure it's all good constructive stuff that helps the family that's ill.  Not shit you have to mind 24 hours a day.  That's got to be a worst case scenario when the whole house is sick and the kid is the one that gets better first.  When I'm 100% healthy, it's a pain in the neck to chase him around all day.  Imagine when your bones are achy and you've got a sinus headache and you can't breathe. 
[00:02:00]  And every time you go up an elevator, you can't hear for 15 minutes.  Oh, my gosh.  Because whatever the fuck happens to your ears when you're all clogged up.  That's what happens when you live in Cloud City.  Cloud City, baby.  That's it.  So all of a sudden, I don't know.  The kid's got to run into the place because I just can't.  And my wife can't.  And somehow he got into the chocolate bars.  So now he's on a sugar high. 
[00:02:30]  A three-year-old on a sugar high in a fucking house where everyone's sick.  Yeah.  Somehow he got into the chocolate bars because I heard some yelling from the other room.  He got into the chocolate bars.  I'm like, all right.  How much could he have had?  I guess he had a lot.  Because then.  Like fucking Beavis.  Yeah.  For the next six hours, he was completely out of his mind.  Oh, my God.  Completely.  It's like having a little Coke head in the house.  Well, that's what I said to you before the show.  I don't do it anymore.  I did it a long time ago. 
[00:03:00]  I dabbled a little bit.  But I was looking at him going, that's someone on Coke.  Is he grinding his teeth?  Just talking nonsense?  He was talking nonsense.  For real.  Like just babbling about weird shit.  Yeah.  And then he went through all his toys within an hour.  Like he would play with something for five seconds.  And just fucking lose interest, run around, grab something else.  Kids' attention span is very short to begin with.  But when they're on the chocolate, forget it. 
[00:03:30]  On the chocolate.  On the chocolate.  It's a drug.  That's a drug.  Absolutely.  For kids, that's a fucking drug.  And a kid not even three yet?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  My kid is now completely wired on the chocolate.  And I just said, I just decide, you know what?  Fucking do whatever you want.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm achy.  My tooth fucking hurts.  So I sit on the couch.  And I'm like, you know what?  The Islanders and Rangers are on.  Ooh.  I'm going to fucking put that on my 65-inch TV. 
[00:04:00]  What?  Nice.  And that's about the time my kid decided to break out his T-ball set.  Aw.  He's got a little plastic T-ball set.  Aw.  And he's like, watch, Daddy, watch.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I got my laptop on my knees.  I'm checking my numbers.  We all check our numbers, right?  Check some tweets.  Check some YouTube views.  Check Facebook.  Check the Instagram.  And he's doing pretty well with that T-ball thing. 
[00:04:30]  Uh-huh.  And, you know, we taught him to keep his eye on the ball.  So I have a video, but I just don't want my kids in the public eye.  Yeah.  We told him to keep his eye on the ball.  So what he does is he puts the ball on the T.  Yeah.  And then he leans all the way down and puts his right eye on the ball.  Hello, bull.  Right.  He's like, ah, that's adorable.  Leans all the way down like this, puts his eye on the ball, and then he's ready to swing.  So he, literal. 
[00:05:00]  He does it every time?  Every time.  Yeah.  Eye on the ball.  Kids just understand literal shit.  Oh, literal kid.  Right.  If you say eye on the ball, he's going to listen to you and go, all right, if that's what you say,  it makes me a better hitter.  I'm going to fucking put my eye on the ball.  There you go.  So he's hitting, and I'm like, wow, that's good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm playing with him a little bit, but not really, because I feel like shit.  He's wired.  I'm like, I have officially given up.  And this T-ball is going on in the living room.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Literally.  I hate to use the word literally, but feet away from my five-month-old. 
[00:05:30]  I literally use it all the time.  Five-month-old.  I was going to ask what's going on with the five-month-old while this is happening.  It's not good enough that he's just playing T-ball in the living room.  He has decided he needs to do it right next to my five-month-old daughter.  I mean, right next to her.  She's in a little bassinet.  Oh, boy.  A couple of the balls ended up in the bassinet.  Oh, no.  But I'm like, I can't control this kid.  He's on drugs right now, a.k.a. chocolate.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  But all of a sudden, I look up to check out the Islanders-Rangers game, and my TV's black. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, what the fuck?  But I could still hear the game.  So it was on BET?  What happened?  Sounds like a nightmare.  Tony in Brooklyn saying, fatherhood is a young man's game.  I'm kind of figuring that out.  A young man's game.  Kind of figuring that out.  Yeah.  So I look up at the 65-inch TV where the nice hockey game was on, and all of a sudden, there's no picture.  I'm like, fuck.  And this happens from time to time, so I'm fucking doing a few things, trying to figure it out. 
[00:06:30]  Settings.  Yeah.  Settings.  Can't figure it out.  So I'm like, fuck it.  So now I'm listening to the game like it's old-school radio.  Oh, you still have sound coming out.  Yeah, through a 65-inch TV, I can't see the fucking picture.  What you could get with a fucking little radio.  Right.  So at this point, my wife comes home.  She's like, I don't know what he did.  So I'm like, I go, could you just please fix the TV?  I just want to watch the game.  Because she kind of knows some workarounds, I guess. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And I just don't.  So she's working on it, working on it, working on it.  Next thing, no, I'm in the other room at this point.  I hear kind of, not a scream, but like a, ah, something like that.  So I come running into the living room, and that's when she pointed out that my 65-inch  TV was spidered.  Somewhere in my fucking, my cloud of fuzziness, he fucking smacked the ball, and he missed  a 65-inch TV.  You missed a good line shot up the middle?  I missed a good fucking hit. 
[00:07:30]  I missed a good hit.  He connected.  And fucking spidered my TV.  Man is high.  Man is fine.  Man is gone.  So I'm like, oh, my TV?  And the people that, you know, our parents out there, they've told me off and on on Twitter  and shit, have you had a, you know, have you lost any of your shit yet?  And I've been really lucky.  It's not like a wiffle ball?  Well, or.  He's got all sorts of balls, all sorts of different sizes, and there is this one yellow. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, no.  Yellow like.  Croquet ball.  It's almost.  Oh, shit.  It's hard.  It's a hard yellow ball that's hollow, and it has like a thing inside that kind of, you  know.  Jingle, jingles.  Jingle, jingly.  Yeah.  I don't even know what the ball was used for, but I guess he put that on there.  Breaking TVs, apparently.  Right.  And it fucking connected.  Oh, shit.  Line drive right to the TV.  Oh, man.  Fuck.  So the TV shot.  65-inch TV gone.  Oh.  There's no fix in those.  There isn't, right? 
[00:08:30]  You don't get those fixed.  No.  So I'm just.  At least you could upgrade now to fucking like an 80.  My day's not over yet.  It's still.  It's not over yet.  So at that point.  If this was a daily day.  If I filmed this, I would compete with Hangover.  This would be a good documentary.  Yeah.  And it should be called Fatherhood is for the Young.  Oh, my God.  So then.  A young man's game.  Your day should be played for sex ed classes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do not have sex.  See what happens.  It's up to you. 
[00:09:00]  Nah.  And so then.  My left eye at this point.  I'm kind of closing it.  Because it's fucking.  Everything just aches.  I'm like.  I got to get out of the house.  You can close your eyes.  Because it's not like you can watch the TV.  Right.  So you can just relax.  You have to imagine.  So.  I.  I'm going downstairs.  Because we had a.  We had to fax something.  And we used to have a printer.  But that.  That went a while ago.  When the kid decided he has to stand on it a lot.  They just are little tornadoes in your house. 
[00:09:30]  Little tiny tornadoes.  We lost that about a year ago.  I just never replaced it.  So if I need to send a fax or something.  I just go downstairs.  Yeah.  I got that shit.  Yeah.  So.  My kid goes.  I want to go with your daddy.  I'm like.  No man.  Dad needs.  Dad needs to just breathe.  A minute away.  Yeah.  So I.  I locked the door.  And then with my key.  I locked the top lock as well.  Because he's getting pretty good leaving the apartment.  You got to fucking put him in a little solitary.  Yeah.  So I make sure.  And I do the double lock. 
[00:10:00]  And I hear him like getting all bummed out.  He can't go with daddy.  And I hear him run away.  All bummed out.  I'm still ridiculously wired on the chocolate.  Yeah.  So then.  I go downstairs.  I'm faxing.  I'm socializing a little bit.  Just chilling out.  Spend some time with some adults.  Right.  And all of a sudden.  The lady at the desk goes.  It's your wife.  But I hear first.  What?  That's what the lady downstairs.  That's.  I hear her side.  She goes.  What?  Oh no.  So I grab it.  It's my wife on the phone calling downstairs. 
[00:10:30]  What's going on?  She goes.  I don't like saying his name on the air.  Blank is in the elevators.  Oh no.  He's in the elevators.  Your kid?  My kid is in the elevator.  Your kid's in the elevator.  So he got.  She said she heard the door open.  Because we figured all this out later.  He will go in the hall a little bit.  But come back in.  We sort of.  Oh boy.  But we sort of watch it.  We're not just assuming it's okay.  Oh boy.  And then she said that she heard the elevator. 
[00:11:00]  And was like no.  No fucking way.  Oh no.  We got it.  So she ran out in the hall immediately of course.  And was to see the doors close.  With a almost three year old in the elevator by himself.  Holy shit.  How many floors is your building?  Uh.  50.  50.  So it's.  And we're.  It's a 50 to one shot.  And we're way up there.  We're way up.  Oh man.  We're almost at the top.  He unlocked all the locks with his little hands?  Yeah.  Because he now pushes like whatever he could find to get up higher. 
[00:11:30]  Oh so he's climbing on stuff.  He's a smart.  A lot of people say he's a pretty smart kid for his age.  I don't know.  Uh.  Yeah.  Look at this here.  Booger couch saying uh.  Your kid's ripping off your fucking internet show.  Yeah.  There's an elevator show for him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he he pushed a box to open up the top lock.  Which we've seen him do.  Holy shit.  And it's not an easy lock man.  It's kind of it's kind of heavy duty.  So we used to fucking some ingenuity there.  Yes.  Push it up. 
[00:12:00]  Yes.  Hopped on the fucking.  And I'm downstairs.  And all of a sudden you know the wife's like he's in the elevators.  I'm like what?  He's in the elevators?  Oh my god.  So I'm.  So you can see where the elevators are.  And I'm like alright where are the elevators?  This is exhausting.  And one was on 18 and one was on I'm trying to I don't know like 30 let's say.  Uh huh.  And I'm like okay.  Is he.  I go call security.  And security goes yeah no one's in the elevators.  Because they could see.  Oh man.  So now he got in the elevator on our floor and now he got off on a floor somewhere in my building. 
[00:12:30]  So you don't now you you don't know where he is.  No.  Oh no.  Oh my god.  No.  So I'm like alright I'll.  Get me to the 18th floor.  And then I'll just like I'll run the stairs until I fucking find him.  Right.  You know.  And then uh just as I was about to do that um uh this lady calls down and goes we have  a kid up here on um I think it was like 24 I guess.  24.  I'm like what? 
[00:13:00]  How'd he get to 24?  I'm in the 40s.  One of those fucking buttons.  I'm in the 40s.  He hit a button.  Door open.  I'm in the 40s.  Wow.  He barely knows how to push the buttons because I don't I tell him not to.  So his whole thing was he was trying to follow me down.  So I go up to the 24th floor and I I'm coming out of like the service elevator and I hear  down the hall it's okay it's okay daddy's coming daddy's coming.  Was he losing his fucking mind?  Oh yeah.  So then I I kind of run around the corner to see my kid pretty fucking freaked out and 
[00:13:30]  scared crying.  Is he happy to see you?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  And then the lady the lady I was thinking of Bill Burr because she had her apartment door  open her husband was kind of peeking out the door.  She was in the hallway with my my son and my my son obviously needed comforting but she  wouldn't touch him.  Yeah.  Because you know it's the day and age we live in.  Yeah.  It's the Bill Burr thing.  You don't fucking.  There's a great bit about that.  You can't touch kids nowadays at all. 
[00:14:00]  So she's trying to comfort him without really touching him in the old days.  He would have like the father like the man of the family would have had the kid like  in his arm going there there and over here's your daddy.  You know a little fucking hat on his head.  Yeah.  You know the police scenario.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The ice cream coat and the cop's hat on his head.  Right.  Nowadays it's like don't touch him.  Right.  Holy shit.  But I saw that go down in person.  She she understands the society we live in.  Yeah.  The world we live in.  And she's she's about a foot or two from him but trying to calm him like her hands are 
[00:14:30]  out and stuff.  She wants to kind of hold him.  Got to block him like a basketball player.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got to fucking.  So I grab him and I'm like oh my God thank you so much.  I'm so sorry you had to deal with this.  And she's like no it's cool.  I was just trying to keep him calm because he was really really upset.  Jesus.  So then you know we we go back up to the apartment and of course you know any moms going through  this when the son is now presented back to you she's going to kind of break down a little 
[00:15:00]  bit.  So she got a little emotional there.  Of course.  A little emotional.  So then we we we asked the the kid what happened you know he goes I wanted to follow daddy.  I got in the elevator I pushed five buttons he pushed five buttons he kept saying that  I pushed five buttons because that's what you do.  And then I got out and I and then I'm going mommy mommy help me help me.  Oh no.  You can only imagine the emotion that would start off. 
[00:15:30]  So did you know the wife must have fucking just lost it at that point.  Mommy help me help me.  Mommy help me.  Daddy help me help me.  And he's he's like he's conveying this story to you guys.  He's close to 20 stories below where I live.  Oh no.  Saying this.  He was saying mom.  See he doesn't understand the concept of an elevator he thinks you go in you get out  and you're still kind of on on the same floor.  It's magic.  Right.  The door opens you're magically somewhere else.  But if you're in the elevator and he thinks like I think he thinks there's only one place 
[00:16:00]  to go which technically it is because we only use the where daddy is right.  I want to I push five buttons I go to where daddy is.  Yeah.  You go in the elevator you push a button and you're downstairs.  He doesn't understand the concept that you could possibly stop somewhere else.  Where daddy isn't.  Right.  Because he just thinks all right go in the elevator push any button and you're right.  That's the where daddy is button.  The daddy buttons.  Right.  But no he was 20 stories below us.  So in the middle of our building.  How many buttons did he push?  He said five. 
[00:16:30]  Five buttons.  Over and over again he said five.  Whatever that means to a kid you need to push five buttons when you're going into an elevator.  He's like Jesse you don't understand I did it right I pushed five buttons.  I pushed five buttons.  I'm not an asshole.  And then it's a little like kind of still sort of a baby voice going.  Oh no.  I wish I could imitate my kid better but basically yeah.  And then I got out and was like mommy help me.  Mommy help me.  Oh my god that's the saddest thing.  A mom never wants to hear that. 
[00:17:00]  No.  Daddy help me.  Help me.  Of course.  She feels like she failed the kid in some way.  The kid has to say mommy help me and mommy's not there.  I kept yelling.  No idea.  Right.  I kept yelling mommy mommy daddy daddy.  Oh my god that's terrible.  Which makes it even worse.  Terrible.  He's only in a diaper and a t-shirt.  And dressed like daddy.  Yeah.  Yeah basically.  And he brought for his little adventure his three favorite toys.  So he's just holding on to his three. 
[00:17:30]  He's on a little tear.  Sure.  He's holding on to his three favorite toys.  20 plus fucking floors below where we live in a hallway.  Holy fuck.  Grabbing those fucking toys like it's everything.  Oh man.  I'm like oh my god.  In case he's got a barter for like food and shelter later.  He's got some fucking money.  Some kid money.  And that's uh.  Oh my god.  So then we kind of got everyone calm and ate dinner.  I woke up with this horrendous sinus headache and here I am. 
[00:18:00]  I think that's it.  Wow.  I'm exhausted.  It was a weird day man.  We don't have days like this ever.  That's constant like having something to do.  I don't like days where you constantly have something to do.  I need some down time and I don't fucking even have a little family.  I don't even know what down time is anymore.  It's magnificent.  I don't know what it is anymore.  Love it.  The down time just got destroyed because the minute there is down time.  Let me flip on the T. 
[00:18:30]  Ah.  The old TVO.  TVO.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Worst of 2013.  Coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  It's the worst of 2013.  Like the production said for the Opie and Anthony show.  My name is Erock hosting this thing for you.  Until Opie and Anthony decide that they're done with vacation and want to come back. 
[00:19:00]  In this segment, James Lipton is in studio.  He's the host of Inside Actors Studio.  Of course you know that.  He stopped by promoting his new book and tells a story about a time when he was working in Paris.  He said he was a tour guide.  Doesn't make any sense.  But he'll explain everything here.  James Lipton.  Right now.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  Obviously, we were astounded by the list of people you have interviewed.  It's quite extensive and an amazing array of celebrities. 
[00:19:30]  When did you start interviewing people in this fashion?  19 years ago.  That's it.  In 1994, when the earth was covered in mists, I had an idea as a member of the Actors Studio  that we ought to create a degree-granting program for the first time in the history of the studio,  which was then 47 years old.  And you know the people that had given us, James Dean and Paul Newman and Marlon Brando 
[00:20:00]  and so forth, right up through Pacino and through De Niro and Jack Nicholson, etc.  And I suggested at that time that we – the studio, first of all, was a very private place.  It was a gymnasium.  And nobody was allowed in from the outside.  It was a place where people could go and what?  Make mistakes.  Why?  Because you learn from your mistakes, right?  But you don't want to make them in public once you're famous. 
[00:20:30]  So that's how it worked.  I said, why don't we create a degree-granting program for the first time?  We don't have to let people in.  The studio is still on 44th Street.  It's still a private, cranky place where nobody can get in.  But let's let this method that has been honed all these years out in an educational environment.  And that was how we started the Actors Studio Drama School, which is now at Pace University.  And when we started the Actors Studio Drama School, I had people who would – all of our core courses, by the way, are taught by life members of the Actors Studio. 
[00:21:00]  That way we'd get the continuity that we wanted.  And so we had people who would teach 30 weeks.  People would come in and do six Fridays in a workshop.  But there was one category left that was unfilled.  And that was those people who are members of the studio or friends of ours or colleagues with whom we've worked who could only give us what? 
[00:21:30]  One night of their lives.  So I sent a letter out and said, will you come and teach our students for one night?  Paul Newman answered.  Dennis Hopper answered.  Sally Field answered.  I got these extraordinary people saying, yes, we'll do it.  And that's when I sent word back into the professional community.  I was by now dean of the Actors Studio Drama School, which I had created it.  So they made me – they said, well, you'll give it a year.  Start it, you know.  How long had you been at the studio by this time?  Had you been there since the beginning?  Only two years.  I'd been there by then. 
[00:22:00]  I was trained by Stella Adler and Harold Klerman.  And so we – I got these responses.  And I sent word back into the professional community from which I had come.  And I said, look, these people are liable to say something worth preserving.  And anybody interested because that means television cameras.  And Bravo took the existential leap with me.  At that time, Bravo had 20 million people, that is to say, and Cablevision. 
[00:22:30]  They were owned by Cablevision.  There were 20 million subscribers.  Today, we are in 94 million homes on Bravo.  We are in 125 countries.  We have a record-breaking 15 Emmy nominations.  And if you had put a gun to my head in 1994 and said, predict that or die, I would have said, pull the trigger.  Can I ask – when you do such an amazing prep for these interviews,  do publicists give you the same thing they give us?  Well, you can't ask about this.  You can't ask – what are the parameters you allow? 
[00:23:00]  We are about to do our 250th episode.  Wow.  Not one publicist has ever told me I can or cannot do anything.  Not one.  There is no pre-interview on our show.  We're the only talk show of our kind that has no pre-interview.  That's why I have to work for two weeks to do those 300 or 400 cards all by myself.  Wow.  And the result of that has been that the guest walks in and has absolutely no idea what's coming next.  That's the rigid rule on our show. 
[00:23:30]  And nobody has ever asked to violate it.  Not once.  I'm amazed by that.  That level of trust they have for you.  It's trust and right.  Well, they know that we're going to talk about craft.  We're not interested in gossip.  Right.  We're a master's degree program.  Those are master's degree candidates sitting out there at Pace University.  And so they know that we're not going to get into gossip.  We don't care about it.  We really don't care.  Seriously.  And what do we care about?  We care about the work they've done.  And if I were to ask you or you or any of anybody in this room, look, I'm going to interview you and what we'll talk about. 
[00:24:00]  I'm just going to ask you about those turning points in your life that made you whoever the hell you are.  Now, both as a as an artist in our case of our show and as a person and you start and I and I've done my research and I know that there was a turning point.  Some somebody died.  Therefore, this.  And so I asked them, I described to me what happened.  And then they they tell me what happened.  And in doing so, what happens? 
[00:24:30]  It's called effective memory in the Stanislavski system.  What happens is the emotions that they felt at the time begin to come back.  And as a result, we became to my absolute astonishment, the most intimate and the most emotional show of our kind.  Who gave you the most emotional interview that you can think of?  Bradley Cooper.  Yeah, look, when I was asked over and over again.  Over the years, who's the guest you want the most?  I said, look, I was for 10 years the dean of the Actors Studio Journalist School.  I was its founding dean.  I'm no longer its dean. 
[00:25:00]  I'm dean emeritus.  And I said, the night that one of my graduated students has achieved so much that he or she walks out on that stage and sits down in that chair next to me is going to be the night I've waited for since we started this program.  And Bradley Cooper graduated in 2000.  We trained him for three years.  And when Bradley walked out on that stage, he looked at me and I looked at him.  We burst into tears.  And we had this.  Wow.  We couldn't go on with the show for a bit until both of us had recovered.  So there is that kind of emotional attachment in the show that, again, doesn't make us better. 
[00:25:30]  I hope it doesn't make us worse.  But it sure as hell makes us different.  Yeah.  And it's honest.  I mean, obviously, not talking about the gossipy end of it, just the craft and just open honesty about it.  I think people feel safe there, too.  So it doesn't feel like they're going to be blindsided by some TMZ reporter.  No, because that's look, we're a master's class class in a university. 
[00:26:00]  We don't care about those.  Yeah.  Our students don't care.  They would be disappointed in me if I asked a question about nothing to do with with the reason that we're all there.  And the result for us, for our students, remember, they come from 100 – we're in 125 countries.  That's not a joke.  We're immense in France, in Japan, in Australia, in the Scandinavian countries, in Latin America.  The show is just huge. 
[00:26:30]  And the result is that our students come to us from all over the world, and they come to us for a reason.  And the guests know that there's a reason.  And therefore, the guests have a reason for coming there, which is to teach them.  And it turned out – I thought it would be so dull.  I thought it would be so dry.  I thought we wouldn't last a year.  I'm serious.  I thought we wouldn't last a year.  Here we are, 19 years, the second longest running show in the history of cable television.  All of these things, it sounds like I'm bragging.  Maybe I am.  But it's also the truth. 
[00:27:00]  And it's not something that I had anticipated or even planned.  It just evolved organically, the way an acting role is supposed to evolve.  Yeah.  How did you accept being thrust into pop culture like that?  I mean, the parodies that have been done about you, which are hilarious.  It appears that I am a figure in pop culture.  Sure.  Watch Arrested Development when it comes back on the air on Netflix. 
[00:27:30]  I'm back on the show.  The Warden Gentles, like the character that I created on the original show.  I'm back on the air.  The Will Ferrell, of course.  We all know about that.  And it is – it's not something that I can plan, but it is something that, to be perfectly frank, that I treasure.  Yeah.  I mean, Will's a friend.  He asked me to be in his movie with him, which I did. 
[00:28:00]  And this thing has evolved, too, over the years, this relationship.  Do I like it?  People ask me, do you hate it?  Hate it?  I would crawl on broken glass to have this kind of thing happen to me.  It must have been odd, though, to be the dean of a university.  It's all happening at once.  I was one of seven deans in a university, which is an academic position, of course. 
[00:28:30]  And at the same time, all this madness was happening.  Yeah.  That's an amazing story.  Of all the people you've talked to, what was something that shocked you?  Like, what's a piece of information somebody gave you?  The most shocking one, I think – well, brace yourselves.  It's quite a tale.  It's brief.  Jack Lemmon was on.  I had known Jack Lemmon when I was a young actor and came to New York, and he was already a famous actor.  And Jack was, you may know, an absolutely elegant human being. 
[00:29:00]  And it was near the end of his life, just a few months from the end of his life, and he was on the show.  And because I'm dean of the school, I'm always trying to make a point for the actors.  I'm didactic, which is one of the things people make fun of me for and some people dislike me for.  They think it makes me pompous.  But I'm always trying to teach them something.  And so I was – here I was working with Jack, and we were talking about Days of Wine and Roses.  And I said to him, you know, the – all the famous scenes in it, the scene next to the crib with the child, 
[00:29:30]  the scene in the greenhouse when you smash it trying to find a bottle that you stowed there,  the scene when you're arrested, all those huge scenes, emotional scenes.  But the most moving, the most thrilling scene in the movie is the quietest.  When you stand up in front of AA for the first time and say those historic words. 
[00:30:00]  And then I paused.  I'm always trying to get my guest – I tried to get De Niro to say, you're talking to me, he wouldn't do it.  I did get Tom Hanks to say, life is like a box of chocolate.  And I waited for him to say it, and he said it.  He said, my name is – he couldn't recall – and he said, my name is so-and-so, and I'm an alcoholic.  And I turned to the students, and I said, see, look, no pushing, no pushing, no begging for anything. 
[00:30:30]  Just do it.  Just do what the character does and let the audience provide the emotion.  See, no pushing.  I said, that's acting.  And he said, no, it's not.  I'm an alcoholic.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  And there follows a 15-second pause, which I kept in the edit because I edited the show.  And it's right there, and we just stare at each other.  And I saw he didn't want to go any further.  Oh, wow.  And so I went on to the next question.  But it was the most startling moment in the history of the show. 
[00:31:00]  Wow.  And afterward, his wife said to me in the green room, first time Jack's ever said that in public.  Wow.  So the fact that he said that, I guess, obviously meant he was in recovery and had kept that private.  Wow.  Yeah.  He was, yeah, but he had never admitted to it in public in his life until that moment.  Would you call that a surprise?  Yeah.  Well, not in this studio, I wouldn't.  Come on, I enjoy a couple of beers myself.  But you're an interesting guy, too, in that you, like, how much of this is folklore? 
[00:31:30]  But back in France, when you were a younger guy, you, you know, what is this?  Oh, God, are you going there?  We have to ask.  Yeah, you were, you were, you were, I don't want to say a pimp per se, but.  I was a mech, macro, which is not, which is not strictly speaking, a pimp.  A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  And generally speaking, that relationship, nowadays, it's unthinkable, unthinkable. 
[00:32:00]  I'm talking about when I was a youngster.  This is long, long ago, where it was all regulated in France and so forth.  But a pimp exploits the women and often treats them horribly.  We all know that.  But a macro works for the women.  They employ him.  And I was living in, I was living in Paris.  I had no, I couldn't get a work permit.  It was out of the question in those days.  Were you acting there?  Were you there?  I had gone, I was, I had been acting in Greece in a film. 
[00:32:30]  And then I came back and I didn't want to come back to the United States for a while.  I wanted to live in Europe and I particularly wanted to live in Paris.  There's an expression in French called rite de passage, rites of passage.  I was going through it and I wanted to continue to go through it.  And I had met by chance, because I had gone, as Americans did in those days, to the Rue Pigalle,  to see a sex exhibition, which was in those days was commonplace in Paris and in America didn't exist at all. 
[00:33:00]  And afterward, I had had a drink in the bar in the bordello and met the young woman who had participated in this.  And we became friends.  She was from Cannes.  She was a beautiful young canoise.  And in those days, France was going through a very hard time.  And the men couldn't get work and certainly the women couldn't.  And there was no opprobrium associated with women who went into what is called the milieu, which is that world, and then came out of it. 
[00:33:30]  No names I could name for you, movie stars and so forth in France, who were in it for a time.  And there was nothing – there were students who were in it, who were earning their way through school, women who were supporting their husbands who were going to college, for example.  They were – it was an entirely different world and completely regulated, medically regulated and everything.  Anyway, then when I ran out of money, she suggested that I would become her mech so that I could stay there and we could continue our friendship and our relationship. 
[00:34:00]  And I did, and it was the most – one of the most interesting years of my life.  Now you know the whole story.  Wow, wow.  But it's –  What is the – one of the responsibilities of –  I would go to the –  In the morning, I would appear at American Express, which is where all the tourists turned up, especially the American tourists, right next to the Paris Garnier and to the Paris Opera. 
[00:34:30]  And other people would be there saying, would you like – I conduct tours.  Would you like to see Chartres?  Would you like to see Notre Dame de Paris, et cetera?  All these people would – these tour guides.  I was a tour guide.  I would say, you want to see some sex.  Okay.  And these Americans, startled Americans would say, yes, this is really what they came to Paris for in those days.  And then –  When was this, roughly?  1950s.  Oh, okay.  And so, you know, France is still recovering from the Second World War. 
[00:35:00]  And the – then I would have to go with them because they were nervous.  They were frightened about it.  And so I would take them there to the bordello and my girlfriend and another woman or a man or whatever it was we had arranged, this thing would occur.  And they were – these people were electrified by it.  And they would ask me to translate for them and speak to these people and tell them what they wanted to see and so forth.  So it was a very strange time in my life. 
[00:35:30]  But it was literally the only way I could remain in France.  I couldn't earn a living any other way.  I would gladly have done something else.  Now, that's probably a much more fun way to make a living.  Did you get involved?  Interesting.  Were you a part of the –  What do you mean by get involved?  Well, you know.  No.  What I would love to have done.  No.  No.  She was my girlfriend for Christ's sake.  Yeah, yeah.  I wasn't going to betray her, even with her.  Wow.  You follow me?  It's very complicated.  You didn't get jealous?  No. 
[00:36:00]  No.  Well, she wasn't – we were friends.  We were really friends more than anything else.  Right, yeah.  And she had arranged for this.  It had to be arranged for her.  They would have found me floating in the sand because you couldn't practice that profession unless you had been endorsed.  Okay.  And so she got me endorsed.  Wow.  What a great story.  I've never discussed this with anybody else before on radio. 
[00:36:30]  Sorry.  It's quite amazing part of your history and just part of history.  We never knew that was going on.  I never would have discussed it at all.  I did in my memoir, Inside, Inside.  Yeah.  It's there in black and white for everybody to read.  But Arthur Lawrence, the great playwright, had been there with a whole group of people.  Stella Adler, who was my acting teacher, and they were all there in Paris.  They came for the summer, and I was there, and that was when I was working. 
[00:37:00]  And they asked me to – and I took them all and arranged one for them as a sex exhibition.  And Arthur wrote about it in his memoir.  Oh, really?  Yeah, six years ago, just before I wrote my memoir.  And he talked about it, and so I felt he had outed me.  Did he drop your name in there?  Drop my name?  I thought maybe it was an anonymous type of –  Oh, he devoted a chapter?  He called me –  He didn't mention your name. 
[00:37:30]  He said the guy who hosts the actor's studio.  No, I wasn't that then.  He called me the sex guide.  Wow.  And so once that had been done, there was nothing I could do about it except my memoir to put it on record truthfully once and for all.  So when Julia Roberts was on my show years ago, and Julia had played, of course, a prostitute famously, and I said, did we interview prostitutes?  And so she said yes, and we got into that.  And then I began to talk about – I said, well, when I was in France, I – and so forth. 
[00:38:00]  And then I realized I had trapped myself.  That was long before I ever discussed it, and I didn't want to go any further with it.  And Julia got – she started laughing.  She couldn't stop laughing.  And it's one of the most famous moments on the show where I was just sort of fumbling around, and I didn't know what to say or how to get out of it.  And Julia could not stop laughing.  I tried to drink her water, and her teeth were rattling on the glass.  She let you off the hook, or she probably could have pursued it.  No, she didn't.  Oh, she didn't.  But I didn't confess anything.  Right, right.  It wasn't until Arthur Lawrence wrote about it as an experience of his life that I decided I had better set the record straight, such as it is. 
[00:38:30]  It's an interesting story.  And you know what?  It's so – it's in a time in history where it doesn't seem as seedy as anything like that now.  Listen, the women who were in the milieu in those days were – some of them were very, very elegant.  And it was – and as I say, they were examined weekly by a doctor.  It was completely regulated.  Some of the bordellos of that time were among the most famous in the history of the world. 
[00:39:00]  These women were like geishas.  And they were so royally treated.  And as I said, women moved in and out.  They needed the money.  They were desperate.  And so they would do this for a while, and then they would come out of it.  People would know that they were in it.  There's a very famous – very, very famous French movie star who was in and out of that milieu.  I won't say who it was.  And that's not my right.  But I know she was.  And when they came out of it, there was no opprobrium whatsoever. 
[00:39:30]  People never even gave it a thought.  The French have always been – look, we're the United States of America.  We're uptight.  But what tradition do we have that the French do not have?  The Puritan tradition.  There is a Puritan tradition in America which we inherited from England.  But the Catholic countries of Europe, France and Italy and so forth, do not have a Puritan tradition.  As a result, they look – neither does Asia.  Neither does Japan, for example.  And so in those countries, you don't find the same kind of nervousness or obsession with sex. 
[00:40:00]  They're much less – actually, much less obsessed.  Less uptight, too.  Just less uptight in general.  One of the problems with the Catholic Church today is that it has become absolutely riveted on the subject of sex.  Right, yeah.  And I'm not criticizing them.  That's their right.  But it is a fact.  And the – they are more sophisticated perhaps about it or – and certainly more casual about it.  They don't see it as a – as every encounter as a life-changing event. 
[00:40:30]  Sure.  I'm not saying that's right or wrong.  But it's different from our own tradition.  We are more uptight.  And it has to do with our Puritan tradition.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think it takes away from some things that could be, you know, art.  I think it takes away from art in this country a lot.  Japanese art, the greatest Japanese artist, the Rembrandts and the Da Vinci's of Japan, all painted pornography. 
[00:41:00]  Pure, pure, graphic pornography.  My wife is half Japanese and half Irish, and she studied art with a great Japanese artist.  He was a national treasure.  They declare them national treasures in Japan.  And he gave her as a gift once, this – it hangs in our house, this painting by a master, one of the 18th century masters of Japanese painting.  And it is a pure pornographic picture.  And it has a place in your home right there prominently displayed. 
[00:41:30]  A pride of place.  You see?  Wonderful.  Love it.  Why not?  Absolutely.  Why not?  Absolutely.  Did you study with – did Brando study with Stella Adler, too?  Brando studied with Stella Adler.  De Niro studied with Stella Adler.  Harvey Keitel studied with Stella Adler.  I studied with her for two and a half years.  She taught for two years, and actually I was – she asked me to stay for another six months, which I did and worked with her.  She was the greatest single academic influence on my life. 
[00:42:00]  So you knew Brando?  Yes, I knew Brando.  So when he was – when I first came to New York, he was already, you know, a star.  But he – I didn't know him quite well, yeah.  I'm always fascinated with people who got to know him because he seems like one of these guys that was rather difficult to get to know.  At the end of his life, I was always trying to get him to be inside the actor's studio.  By then he was reclusive, and he would sit up in his home, and he would make phone calls.  He would call me, and we would talk for 45 minutes, but he would never appear on the show. 
[00:42:30]  By then he would not come out of his house, and he was very, very, very bizarre.  He'd speak to me in Spanish, and I said, I don't speak Spanish, and then he would stop.  But we used to talk for a long time.  I said, why don't we say this on the air for God's sake?  Right, right.  No, but he wouldn't do it. 
[00:43:00]  So he's one that got away.  But he – by then, it wouldn't have been very valuable anyway because he had spit the bit.  He was no longer interested in acting, and he contemned it, and he hated himself, as we all know.  It ended poorly.  Yeah.  But when I first saw him, when I first came to New York, I saw him in Streetcar.  Oh, wow.  And he was the greatest actor I ever saw.  Did he really dislike guys like Rod Steiger?  Because there's this famous story about when they were doing that, you know, I could have been a contender, Charlie, that he wouldn't even do Rod's close-ups with him, that he just hated his acting. 
[00:43:30]  Is that the truth?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I don't answer that.  I don't know that he did.  But certainly that scene is justly famous.  He did everything wrong in it.  He did everything unpredictable in it.  Instead of being angry at his brother, instead of being frightened of his brother, the two things that you would think that any actor would have chosen, made those choices in the scene. 
[00:44:00]  And his brother was destroying him at that moment.  What was he instead?  He was heartbroken.  He was heartbroken that his brother would do this.  It was the most amazing choice.  And only a Brando could have made it.  I think that nothing impresses me in an actor more than risk.  If an actor takes chances and is utterly unpredictable, then I know I'm in the presence of a great actor. 
[00:44:30]  And there's one more ingredient that's necessary.  If the actor, first, you are absolutely startled by his choices or her choices.  And in the end, you realize they were what?  Inevitable.  So, that's what makes a great, great actor.  And that's why Brando, to my taste, is the greatest of his time.  We have some great ones going now.  Who do you think is unpredictable now?  Completely, who shocked you? 
[00:45:00]  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Wow.  He is good.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Did Brando ever talk about acting and the actual craft of acting in public in any way?  Yeah, he decided, after I started Inside the Actor's Studio, I think he was inspired by it, because he's a member of the Actor's Studio.  He was so aware of it.  He decided he was going to teach a class in Los Angeles.  Advertisements went out.  People flocked. 
[00:45:30]  And they rushed to be taught by Marlon Brando.  And they arrived at the appointed place.  And he waited for it.  The door opened for him to come in.  He walked in in a dress, as I recall.  It lasted, I think, about 24 hours.  By then, he was two.  He hated acting.  Isn't that odd?  He thought that acting was not a worthy profession.  And you know why?  Because he was a genius.  Geniuses make one mistake consistently. 
[00:46:00]  They think that whatever they do is easy.  Why?  Because it's easy for them.  And they didn't have to learn it, because it came from instinctively.  And as a result, they think it's easy.  And it's easy for them to become contemptuous of it.  Because, look, I'm doing this thing.  What's so special about what I'm doing?  Why should anybody make a fuss?  And eventually, people like Brando become contemptuous of it.  For example, Ted Williams had to teach himself every moment of swinging a bat. 
[00:46:30]  And he could teach you how to swing a bat, because he had had to teach himself.  He wasn't a genius.  What he was was a great, great, great, great student.  And he taught himself how to do it.  Willie Mays never gave it a minute's thought in his life he was a genius.  It just happened.  He would get up there, he'd swing the bat, and he'd hit a home run.  And there are those two kinds of, those two approaches to a craft.  And Marlon was absolutely a genius.  He just was able to do it.  Now, he was well trained by Stella Adler. 
[00:47:00]  He had a thorough training from her.  When you put together technique with talent, you can't teach talent.  Talent's what you bring to the table.  I wonder what that's like.  Yeah, exactly.  I said, I wonder what that's like.  No, I'm sure you know.  But you put together talent and technique, and then out comes a brand.  You know, I can't even watch movies.  Like, Miracle on 34th Street was on recently.  I just can't watch things from that era anymore. 
[00:47:30]  Because, again, watching guys like Brando and Hoppin or whoever,  I can't watch the old school acting anymore.  It just seems so disconnected to anything I knew it.  Well, because it was English acting.  Until the Stanisławski system took hold in America through the group theater,  out of which came Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg  and all the teachers whom I have studied with,  until then, it was a pale imitation of English theater.  They had a kind of false English accent.  Everything had to look good, and they practiced in front of a mirror 
[00:48:00]  until they had themselves just the way they wanted.  None of it was organic.  None of it was felt.  None of it was emotional.  None of it was real.  It was all a system of posing.  It was rhetorical.  It was essentially false.  Very much like old stage acting.  That's what I'm talking about.  It was theater acting.  They took it to film.  But then when the group,  when the Moscow Art Theater on Stanisławski came here in the 1920s, 
[00:48:30]  there was a revolution.  And that was when Strasberg and Stella Adler and Harold Clurman and Cheryl Crawford,  they saw what was happening on that stage,  and they knew that the door had opened.  It would never close again.  And then they founded the group theater.  Out of that came the plays of Odette's.  Out of that came all of our greatest actors.  And today, it's transcendent in the world.  There is no actor who is not touched by it in one way or another.  And in America, we've had some very, very, very great teachers.  The greatest of whom I thought was Stella Adler. 
[00:49:00]  And she did teach Brando.  And once again, there with me, I brought a minimal talent to it, so I was okay.  But he brought this great talent, put it together with her technique,  and out came a very great actor.  This footage of...  Oh, they seem like they...  Yeah, unfortunately.  I just want to ask one more question.  Did they say this footage...  I'm not a fan of Shakespeare.  I can't enjoy it.  But I watched Brando doing, like, you know, Caesar.  Mark Anthony, I think, he was doing it.  And I couldn't take my eyes off it, 
[00:49:30]  because it was like, this is the only guy I've ever seen do it.  Neither could the English actors.  Because I remember once, one of the English actors on my show,  was it Tony Hopkins or John Hurt?  I've forgotten which one it was.  Ian McKellen.  They said to me, look at the Julius Caesar.  You'll see what Brando was doing was he...  Here we all came with this classical training,  with the perfect body, the perfect voice, the perfect behavior.  And Brando came on that screen, and we were all of us in the shadow. 
[00:50:00]  And he was.  He was able to bring to it the kind of deeply felt emotions  of American training in acting.  When applied to Shakespeare, who was a great writer of emotion,  a great writer of feeling, a great writer of character. 
[00:50:30]  And when you put those two together,  then you've got a performance like Brando's.  But, I mean, others do it very well.  I think Tony Hopkins is a perfect combination.  When he was on my show, he told me that while he was studying  at the Royal Academy in London,  learning the kind of acting that we all associate with Shakespeare  and with the English tradition,  he was sneaking off and studying Stanislavski with an actor,  acting teacher in London,  and putting the two of them together.  And when you put that exterior technique, which is external, 
[00:51:00]  in which certain aspects of the character are acquired externally,  together with an internal technique that digs deep into your own soul  and makes you recreate whatever it was that Shakespeare wrote and said  organically from your own life experience  and from your own deepest, deepest, the marrow of your bones,  then you get the kind of exquisite acting that all of us can react to  and never forget. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  So rare to see.  They're telling us what they...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You have other press today.  You have a lot more press today.  You're very busy today, apparently.  James is promoting, of course, inside the actor's studio.  It's an amazing show.  You get more out of actors.  You watch Tina Fey, which is tomorrow night on Bravo.  And we talked about what?  Improvisation.  Because she came from Second City.  She gives a lesson in improvisation that is incomparable. 
[00:52:00]  And guess what?  We then improvised,  and I was allowed by her to interview Sarah Palin.  Oh, she does...  Watch it.  Yep, she does.  Sarah Palin.  We do about eight minutes together of Sarah Palin,  of her, Sarah Palin,  and it is absolutely extraordinary.  Yeah, that was...  And it's improvisation.  Oh, totally improvising.  We're both improvising.  You just...  You're an amazing interviewer and a great guest,  and, you know...  Yeah, thanks so much for...  What you get out of actors is amazing.  No one gets that stuff out of them. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you.  Fantastic.  Thanks for coming in.  And I think a great interviewer gets things out of people.  Like, you know,  some people got James to talk about things  that he hasn't talked about.  Right, Jimmy.  My wife is...  If she hears this,  she's going to kill me.  Meanwhile, you should have maybe gotten  an acting lesson from him instead of acting.  Yeah, I really should have.  I do things that are unpredictable, too.  I forget the lines,  and when I do remember, I suck.  Jimmy has a problem.  He doesn't know what to do with his hands  to make them look natural as he's acting.  Yes.  He's either by there or fault. 
[00:53:00]  Hands are the problem.  Look at...  You watch Hoppy Bogart.  Bogart never figured out what to do with his hands.  He usually tucks them into the belt of his pants.  Really?  Bogart couldn't even figure it out?  Watch him.  He was never comfortable with his hands.  I find that what I'll do is I'll just talk...  I'll just put them over my head out of frame.  People just forget that they exist.  That's why in the K-mutiny,  he was doing that with the Marbles,  but he just brought those one day.  It wasn't even part of the script.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's Worst of 2013.  2013.  On the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[00:53:30]  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  2013.  Continues right now.  Worst of 2013.  Opie and Anthony show.  The production just said that,  but I'm saying it again.  Hello, my name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  And if you want to follow the guys  while all this is going on vacation,  it's at Opie Radio.  It's at Anthony Cumia.  And it's at Jim Norton.  Also, you can follow the show account  at O and a show at O and a show. 
[00:54:00]  Just that simple.  And maybe we're doing something  during the vacation  that you might find interesting  because you're bored  and have nothing else to do.  Moving on.  We're going into  we're going to look back  at Charles Ramsey.  Charles is this guy  up in Cleveland, Ohio,  who happened to come across  these three girls  who have been missing  for about 10 years.  Anyway, Charles Ramsey.  Here it is.  O and A's Worst of 2013.  Charles Ramsey,  as Travis put it  during the break,  is the gift 
[00:54:30]  that keeps on giving.  He's the guy  that saved  the broad up there  in Cleveland.  What's her name again?  Amanda Burry, right?  Amanda Burry was yelling  and screaming.  She had a hand  like sticking out  of the house, I guess.  She's the daughter  of Blue and Dingle.  And Charles Ramsey  hears the commotion  and helps her get out  of that fucking  house of horrors.  And now they can't  stop fucking interviewing him  because they know  he's gold.  We have to just find  every interview  Charles Ramsey has done. 
[00:55:00]  We found another one  with a black reporter  that we're about to play.  Is there a remix yet?  Are there 20 remixes  out there yet?  This is from Fox.  Fox?  Fox 8.  Is it good?  Yeah.  I mean, I listened  to the first...  You asked me  to preview it.  It's two and a half  minutes long.  I listened to the first  30 seconds  and I stopped  and I said  this is good.  Oh, okay.  What channel  was this on?  This is on Fox  in Cleveland.  So Fox 8.  Local Fox.  Fox 8.  Was Fox hungry?  Wow.  We all fell for that one. 
[00:55:30]  Here's Charles Ramsey.  Another interview.  Yeah, this is  Charles Ramsey, correct?  Yes, sir.  You live next door  to the home.  Yes, sir.  I talked to you earlier.  Can you tell our viewers  again what happened?  I went to McDonald's.  I came home.  I meet my McDonald's.  I got the day off  from work  so naturally  you're doing nothing.  And I hear this  girl screaming  and she's going nuts.  So I come outside  and I know  there's nobody  that's supposed  to be screaming  next door to my house 
[00:56:00]  because there's no girl  that lives in that house.  So that's a dare  give away to something wrong.  And when I came  to the front door  and looked at her  she said,  my name is Amanda Bear.  Please get me out  of this house.  So I'm thinking  yeah, whatever.  So I helped her  get out the house.  I ain't thinking  that you really  that girl that's missing.  You've been gone  for so long.  You know,  you think you lying.  And she called the police  and they came  and they took  a fingerprint sample  of her blood sample  and it came back.  It was her.  And then she said  it was two more  girls up in the house. 
[00:56:30]  Now, I don't know this.  I just helped her move out.  You're correct.  I don't know this.  I can't move out.  And then a woman  named Michelle.  I helped her move out.  And if you look  it almost looks like  he said there's two more  bitches in the house.  Two more bitches in there.  It looks like he's trying  not to say that.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you watch that?  Because you know  his fucking lingo  when he's not  in front of the camera  is a little different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm glad he did his hair.  And then she said  it was two more  girls on the night. 
[00:57:00]  Now, I don't know this.  Good call.  You can see his lips  make a B.  They made a B sound.  Yes.  Two more bitches in the house.  Two more bitches in the house.  Bitches.  And up in the motherfucker.  And it came back  it was her.  And then she said  it was two more  girls in the house.  Now, I don't know this.  I just helped her move out.  You're correct.  It was Gina DeJesus  from Seattle.  And then a woman  named Michelle Knight.  I don't know.  And Michelle Knight 
[00:57:30]  is like  I don't know that nigga.  I don't know.  Charles Ramsey  fucking rule.  This is Buzz Ramsey.  Buzz Ramsey.  I don't know.  Best guy ever  to get involved  in this situation.  I don't know.  You're correct.  It was Gina DeJesus  from Seattle.  Yeah.  And then a woman  named Michelle Knight.  You've been living  next door to that house.  Had you known  there were any people.  No.  Because I'd have pulled  this heroic stuff  last year.  I'd have pulled 
[00:58:00]  this heroic shit.  He was there to go  I'd have pulled  this heroic shit.  So far he wants to say  two bitches  and shit.  And shit.  He absolutely  was going to say shit.  I'd have pulled  this heroic shit  years ago.  Motherfucker.  So did that house  have you known  there were any people.  No.  Because I'd have pulled  this heroic stuff  last year.  With my goons.  With my goons.  Thank you for restraining  yourself.  Thank you for  restraining yourself.  So you realize  who it was. 
[00:58:30]  So once she said  her name  you recognized the name.  Yeah.  And then I walked  down the street  and I told my  last interview  he said he had  no idea.  Yeah of course.  This guy's story  will change.  He'll be more  the hero.  And he'll be  arrested for something.  I busted in there  motherfucker.  Yeah.  I put my guns out.  I sensed something.  I sensed something.  I seen he wasn't  right this guy.  Yeah.  But he just  lied from  interview to interview.  I'm like  fucking super fly.  This guy is my  neighbor. 
[00:59:00]  Anthony.  And I say  Anthony.  That's impossible.  But he told me  I was paranoid  because I just  moved on the street  and I told him  something.  Oh my God.  Now he's saying  he knew something  was up next door.  This guy is just  fucking going to  build it into.  I love him.  He's going to be  a superhero by Friday.  Oh man.  I said Anthony.  I put on my cap.  My spidey senses.  And then I walked  down the street  and I told my  neighbor Anthony  and I said Anthony  me and Anthony  talked about this  last year.  But he told me 
[00:59:30]  I was paranoid  because I just  moved on the street  and I told him  something's wrong  with that house.  He told me  just leave it alone.  Pause.  What the fuck?  He didn't say  any of this.  We got to put  the interviews together.  In the one interview  did you know  who it was?  Nah.  Yeah I knew who it was.  And then  I would look at him  and you wouldn't  think anything  I would think  anything I had.  Why would you  have a barbecue  with him?  Have a barbecue.  He was tinkering  in his car.  You never know.  He was just  normal guy.  I said I knew  something was up  last year.  There was a fire.  Oh this guy's  there was a fire.  I got a feeling  he rules. 
[01:00:00]  Alright we got  those two.  We got to put  back to back.  Yeah.  Those two.  Did you know  the person that  lived there?  Yeah we all  know him.  Don't say his name.  That was a good dude.  You know him.  Yeah.  But you thought  he lived there  by himself.  Yes.  Yes.  That's what I'm  saying to hear  some noises  coming next door  don't make no sense  because I know  you lived there  by yourself.  police took him  into custody.  They said  this is what I heard  they caught him  at McDonald's  because what I did 
[01:00:30]  was gave him  I gave them  the description  of the car  that he was in.  Okay I guess  he drives a blue  Mazda Miata  I think I  just confirmed  that as well  earlier.  Can you hear me?  I gave him  the description  of the car.  They never would  have caught that  nigga's voice  with my ass  motherfucker.  Oh my god  this guy's gold.  Is there any more  interviews with him?  Two so far.  We should get him  on the phone.  Oh he is great.  We should get Charles  Ramsey on the phone. 
[01:01:00]  Oh he is going  to be all over  the place  changing his  little stories.  Yeah Eric in  Michigan he sounds  like the husband  of the I don't  got time for that.  Yeah.  Yeah we've been  saying that all  morning.  I got bronchitis.  Oh there's a fall.  Her daughter  that appears to  have been created  by a sexual  assault or rape  and this man  Charles Ramsey  walking by  didn't turn his head  and say I don't  want to get involved.  He jumps up on 
[01:01:30]  the porch.  He breaks down  the door and  gets her out  gets her to 9-1-1.  There's two heroes  and these women  are alive because  of Charles Ramsey.  It's fantastic.  John I remember  with the Dugards  in retrospect  there were people  who said there  were girls  kept in the  backyard and  the neighbors  no one ever  stepped forward.  The cops checked  it out but they  weren't able to  find anything.  Meanwhile there  were girls inside  there kept for  years.  What are your  early indications  and investigations  showing?  Were there people  who were suspicious  that are all  about this house? 
[01:02:00]  Well let's talk  about J.C.  Dugard for a  minute.  You know  neighbors made  complaints and  parole and  probation officers  and sheriffs  went into that  house and  Philip Garrido  who was a  level 3 sex  offender who  had been  convicted of  kidnapping a  girl and  beating her  severely and  keeping her  in a storage  unit that he  was actually  arrested and  went to jail  for a month  for parole  violation while  his crazy  mother, I  mean sorry  his crazy  wife, wife 
[01:02:30]  kept J.C.  in the  backyard.  Now if I  was the  cop that  came to  arrest him  for violation  I would  have searched  the whole  house, went  out in the  backyard, etc.  So I think  law enforcement  can learn  something from  this to take  these calls  very, very  serious.  God, can you  imagine?  They were that  close and they  didn't find it?  That's the Dugard  case where they  were living in the  backyard in that  structure or whatever.  And he had a  parole violation so  they sent him to  jail and the  fucking wife  watched the  captive.  Didn't set her 
[01:03:00]  free or nothing.  And the fact that  he kidnapped a  girl and beat her  and then was on  parole.  Yeah, yeah, that's  just.  And they were so  close to finding  what was going on  in that residence  but they didn't  check the whole  place.  From top to  bottom.  Wow, can you  imagine being  those people  knowing that the  cops are right  outside and just  waiting going,  alright, it's a  matter of time  they're going to  get to where I'm  at and they  never do?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Jeez.  I have some  Charles Ramsey  comparison.  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's do  Charles Ramsey  comparison.  Also, we're 
[01:03:30]  trying to call  the guy but his  voicemail box is  full.  I bet.  Yeah, I would  assume.  But we got his  actual number?  That's kind of  cool.  Alright, so first  we're going to  listen to his  first interview  that we listened  to this morning.  Just a part of  it?  Yeah, just a  part of it.  And then we're  going to listen to  the interview that  we just played  on Fox.  See if there's  any discrepancies.  That's my idea.  Of course.  And this is Jim  Norton's idea.  This is Jim  Norton's idea.  Comes out with  a little girl and  she says, call  911.  My name was 
[01:04:00]  Amanda Berry.  Did you know  who that was  when she said  that?  Well, she told  me it didn't  register until  I got to call  911.  And I'm like,  I'm calling  911 for Amanda  Berry.  I thought this  girl was dead.  Okay.  And then he  said this on  Fox.  So I'm  thinking,  whatever.  So I helped  her get out  the house.  I ain't  thinking that  you really  that girl  that's  missing.  You've  been gone  for so  long.  You know,  you think  you're  lying.  And she  called the  police and  they came  and they  took a  fingerprint  sample of  her blood  sample and  it came  back.  It was  her. 
[01:04:30]  So first  time,  no,  first time  he says,  I didn't  think about  it until I  called 911.  Second time  he says,  when I'm  getting her  out of the  house,  I'm thinking,  no,  you're not  the  person.  But doesn't  the guy  say,  did you  recognize  the name  in the  second  interview?  Yeah,  yeah,  that's  true.  And then  she said  it was  two more  girls up  in the  house.  Now,  I don't  know this.  I just  helped her  move out.  You're  correct.  And then  a woman  named  Michelle  Knight.  Next door  to that  house, 
[01:05:00]  had you  known  there  were  any  people?  No,  I don't  pull this  heroic  stuff  last year.  Yeah,  there's a  part of  that  interview  where he  asked  if you  recognize  the  name.  You  left  off  the  last  part  of  the  second  interview.  Who  it  was,  though,  once she  said  her  name,  you  recognized  the  name.  Yeah,  no doubt.  All right,  now,  we're going  to see if  he had  any  suspicions  that  something  was  in  this  other  house.  First 
[01:05:30]  interview.  Every  day,  I mean,  every  day.  How long  have you  lived here?  I've been  here a  year.  You  should  come  up  room?  I  barbecue  with  this  dude.  We  eat  ribs  and  what  night  and  listen  to  salsa  music.  You  should  come  room?  And  you  had  no  indication  that  there  was  anything.  Not  a  clue  that  that  girl  was  in  that  house.  Okay.  And  then  he  said  this  on  Fox.  I  told  my  neighbor  Anthony  and  I  said  Anthony  me  and  Anthony  talked  about  this  last  year  but  he  told  me  I  was  paranoid 
[01:06:00]  because  I  just  moved  on  the  street  and  I  told  him  something  wrong  with  that  house.  I  called  9-1-1  as  well.  So  all  right. 
[01:06:30]  and  we  been  in  this  bitch  she  said  her  name  was  Linda  Barry  or  some  shit  I  don't  know  who  the  fuck  that  is  I  just  moved  over here  for a  fuck  that  is  not a clue. 
[01:07:00]  I also like how we've had two interviews with him and a 911 phone call and he has to tell everyone that he just came from McDonald's.  He loves McDonald's.  It was an endorsement deal.  Go back a little bit.  Oh  and  this is how he really talks.  We thought you were dead.  Oh  the story has changed.  Oh  Charles.  And then it turns into  yeah I knew who that was. 
[01:07:30]  Now it's like I don't know who that motherfucker is.  See we're kind of  this is like Pulp Fiction  like we're getting all the pieces.  Yes.  Yes.  So this is before any interview.  Of course.  This is as raw as it gets.  What's wrong with you  Will?  What's the problem?  She like this motherfucker  been kidnapped me and my daughter  and we've been in this bitch.  She said her name was Linda Barry  or some shit.  I don't know who the fuck.  that is.  I just moved over here bro.  Sir.  Sir.  You know what I mean?  Sir.  You have to calm down and slow down.  Is she still in the street?  Uh  Seymour  Is she still in the street 
[01:08:00]  or where does she go?  Yeah I'm looking at her.  She right now.  She calling y'all.  She on another phone.  Is she black white or Hispanic?  Uh  She white  but the baby look Hispanic.  Okay  where does she win?  Uh  Uh  white  tank top  light blue  uh  sweatpants.  Sound like  like a wife beater.  Do you know the address next door  that she said she was in?  Yeah  2207  I'm looking at it.  Okay I thought that was your address  so that  that house  I'm smarter than that bro  I'm telling you what a crime would  not in the house  Sir. 
[01:08:30]  I'm smarter than that bro  I'm telling you what a crime would  not in my house  There's absolutely something  that they're gonna catch up.  Oh this guy  Of course  is in for a treat.  This guy is great.  Oh they're gonna just run his name  and be like  Oh I feel bad for Charles Ramsey.  Look what we got here.  He sounds like Samuel L. Jackson.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  That's the one that says  bad motherfucker.  I thought that was your address  so that  I'm smarter than that bro 
[01:09:00]  I'm telling you what a crime would  not in my house.  Sir we can't talk at the same time.  Do you want to leave  your name and number?  Charles Ramsey  R-A-M-S-B-Y  What's the phone number?  Yeah  They didn't  Oh they didn't bleep it out?  No I don't want it.  Okay so he gives his phone number  and then we go back to it.  People she said it did this  Do you know if they still in the house?  I don't have a fucking clue bro  I just said I came to McDonald's  Can you  Can you ask her  if she needs an ambulance?  Do you need an ambulance?  Or what?  Ambulance?  She needs everything 
[01:09:30]  She's up for  She's in a panic bro  I guess she's been kidnapped  so you know  put yourself in her shoes  We'll send the police out  Thank you  There you go  That's classic  Oh is he great  Yeah  Charles Ramsey is in for  the biggest fucking  I feel bad for him  The biggest spike in  hero popularity  and fucking  It never works out in the end  He's gonna be like that  Kraft macaroni and cheese guy  Like oh look  he's just a guy  he's down on his luck 
[01:10:00]  and then it's like  this is a Louis Vuitton  I see a year of jail  in his future  for some past crime  Oh yeah  That he's been fucking  dodging for years  just cause he's the  comes forward as the hero  He must have had  such a hard time  with the press  not fucking cursing  cause that's  that's the real one  Oh yeah  That's the one we just heard  is the real dude  This motherfucker  Yeah this motherfucker  I don't know  who the fuck that is  They got the Charles Ramsey  on the Anderson Cooper  last night on CNN 
[01:10:30]  Yeah he did Anderson Cooper's show  We're checking out  all the interviews  and bringing the best  clubs to you  Here's Charles  telling Anderson  what happened  So yesterday  what happened?  Uh oh  Yeah you're gonna love this  cause I'm gonna tell it all  Around 3 o'clock  I was on my porch  and the mailman  put his mail  in my mail  So I looked at him  and was like  I gotta get an area  on his mail  when he come home  Couple minutes later 
[01:11:00]  he pulled up  he checked the mailbox  grabbed his mail  before he went in the house  I said area  here go your mail  and we just had  the same conversation  when I hand him the mail  he said they can't  get it right  I said nope  damn postal service  that's it  he left  I jumped on my bike  went to McDonald's  He mentions McDonald's again  I know  He's not a dumb guy  He's not dumb  He knows someone's  paying attention  I went to McDonald's  Jesus  Imagine 
[01:11:30]  the greatest  would be  if the fucking girls  come out  and they go  and all we ate  for 10 years  was McDonald's  McDonald's  McDonald's gets a black eye  Those murderers  loved McDonald's  those fucking kidnapping  They would always eat McDonald's  after a second  complete black eye  in the McDonald's  I came back home  I'm in my house  enjoying McDonald's  but I'm in the living room  and I'm right  by the front door  because I'm looking  out the front door  Oh he's too much detail guy  And man this girl 
[01:12:00]  screamed  like a car  had hit a kid  which made me  you know  you stop eating  you know  what the hell was that  so when I got up  I saw this  my neighbor across the street  he run across the street  and I'm like  I'm thinking  where are you going  because ain't nobody  next door  because I just saw Ariel leave  and I know ain't nobody over there  heard that girl scream  and saw him run across the street  and I went outside  and wondered what he was doing  and  a man would say  I'm stuck in here  help get me out 
[01:12:30]  so he  either don't know  English that well  or panic  but he just looked at me  and was like  he's a girl  and that's all he did  so here I come  with my  you know  half eating Big Mac  and she's like  I've been trapped in here  and he won't let me out  it's me and my baby  I say well  you ain't gotta talk no more  come on  and I'm trying to get the door open  and they can't  I used some of the grease  from the french fries  to lubricate the lock  that's what I did  and then I put a mixed nugget  in the corner 
[01:13:00]  and Jimmy the door open  yeah yeah yeah  what happened to the Big Mac  I couldn't see her too well  so I stood on the Big Mac  cause it's so big  and I could look inside  she said my baby's sick  so I gave her a bite  to the Big Mac  and the girl was healed  he loves his Big Mac  oh shit  this guy talking about  plug all up  oh man  torture chamber  did some kind of way  and locked it up right  so I did what I had to do  and kicked the bottom of it 
[01:13:30]  the door  and she crawled out of it  she grabbed her baby  threw me off  alright  we're fine  I got  some girl  a hell kid  and what did she look like  I mean  what was she wearing  a jumpsuit  she had a white  tank top on  Big Mac yellow  yeah yeah  it looked like  the same color  the secret sauce  that goes on  the two all beef patties  pickles onions  on the sesame seed bun  her shoes look like pickles  she looked like a McDonald's sign 
[01:14:00]  oh fuck it  rings on mascara  you know she was well groomed  she was like  she didn't look like she was kidnapped  that's what I'm saying  that's what threw me off  when she was like  I'm in here trapped  I'm like well  you don't look like kidnapped  so maybe you got a boyfriend problem  boyfriend problem  oh boy  so I took the kid  stat for a happy meal  and you'd never seen her before  bro

[01:22:00]  that little girl  came out the house  and she was crying  and I'm looking at her  right now  I'm like  your mama  trying to help you  girl  shut up  I don't know  shut up  and she's like  I want my daddy  and I said  who was her daddy  she said Ariel  oh  yeah  I said  well how is that possible  cause you ain't  you wouldn't  if you got kidnapped  oh he was having  sex with you  oh Jesus  that little girl  is just  what the  now we want  to hurt you  you felt that  brother 
[01:22:30]  if this would be  a different interview  I told you that  if we had known that  man I'd be facing  triple life  I'm glad  I'm glad it turned  out this way  nice  triple life  nice bow on it  Anderson  yeah  wow  he is cool  triple life  with my  double patties  I'm having trouble  sleeping man  if I only had a  big mac bun  I could rest my  head on  cause they're so 
[01:23:00]  big and  fluffy  he also was in  studio at a  Cleveland TV station  you wanna try it  it wasn't as good  as the Anderson  Cooper but  you can give it a  shot see where it  goes  more more more  but the biggest  most mysterious  question in this  whole motherfucker  whatever happened  to the McDLT  that shit was good  there was the  cold lettuce  and tomato  on one side  and the hot  patty on the  other motherfucker  but they done 
[01:23:30]  discontinued  that nigga  I don't know  what the fuck  and I checked  under her shirt  to see if she  had any broken  McRibs  and that's the  only thing he  wants is to  bring that back  of course  that's all he  asked  bring that back  I love the  McDLT  bring back the  McDLT  and we're square  the cold side  and the warm side  the lettuce  never wilted  cause they didn't  put the shit  on the meat  till you's ready  to eat up  the motherfucker  his whole problem 
[01:24:00]  could have been  avoided  if they just  didn't discontinue  the motherfucking  McDLT  the Cleveland  TV program  with the polished  anchors in studio  and he had a nice  brand new lid on  he brought his  homies with him  and we'll give  this a shot  he's got his crew  I opened the door  naturally as you  can see on the news  and it wouldn't  come  it wouldn't bro  he had a lock  on there  and you couldn't  open it  and the police  had to  when they got  there  they finally  got in a jar 
[01:24:30]  and Amanda  says  it's two more  girls up there  and I looked  at her  and I looked  at the cop  that was in  the middle  of the street  and he said  it's what  and she said  I'm not the only  one  and they went  up there  in about  I don't know  15-20 seconds  they were coming  out with  Gina  and that other  girl  and I said  oh my god  Charles  you've done  so much  and we are  all grateful  for the fact  that you were  there then  and that you  were able  to help them 
[01:25:00]  as you go  through this  a lot of people  were wondering  how the community  didn't know  were the windows  boarded up  had you not heard  anything in that house  all I would hear  was salsa music  that's all we  played  naturally  naturally  naturally  see  we're a racist  but we all  are racist  you know  all we heard  was salsa music  naturally  naturally  naturally  because those  people play  that music  yeah you know  that's as common 
[01:25:30]  as seeing a newborn  with PSTs  in this neighborhood  motherfucker  but of course  naturally  that's funny  oh shit  we all have  oh you all have  our shit  naturally  against the other races  all jumpity jumpity  yeah  I couldn't see  behind a fuzzy dice  as you know  of course though  naturally  it was Cinco de Mayo  naturally  yeah  of course  yeah we didn't even 
[01:26:00]  think twice about a bunch  jump living in the same house  you can understand  yes yes  of course  of course  anything in that house  all I would hear  was salsa music  that's how we  he played  naturally  one day  I was playing my music  rap music  naturally  he came  to my house  and told me  turn my music down  because I'm disturbing him  at this time  he was a bus driver  I understood that  he had to get up in the morning  and go drive the bus  then when that 
[01:26:30]  came about yesterday  I got girls  in the basement  it had nothing to do  with you getting some sleep  that's why I was bothering you  that's why I had to  turn my music down  how can I be disturbing you  what are you doing in there  you weren't reading the bible  damn  I'm not  the one thing I don't know  how did they pick up Ariel  where was he  did they just wait for him  to come home  and fucking nap him  they might know  where he was going  or maybe you know  they just  how's that even came out  how did they pick him up  and his two brothers  I don't know  there it is  McDLT  the hot side 
[01:27:00]  and the cold side  why don't we know  that part of this  maybe  we know every other detail  I don't know  I'm sure it'll come out  it's probably just some  what did they say  he was going to McDonald's  or something  I think he was going  to McDonald's as well  was he really  I think so  McDonald's is fucking  what's a little less  holy shit right  yeah a little less exposure here  what was the other food option  McDonald's  or the new goat shit  palace that opened up  we have cold goat shit  we have hot goat shit  we have goat shit  that's sliced and diced  and we have melted goat shit  you can eat it on 
[01:27:30]  you can eat it on  peanut bread  or panty bread  we don't know  what it's called  or McDonald's  or you can eat it  on the folded scrotum  of a horse  goat shit  wrapped in folded  horse scrotum  or McDonald's  I think I'll go  McDonald's  they all get along  at McDonald's  yeah  perbs  sex slaves  and heroes  they all fuel their souls  with McDonald's  we've all been brought together  Jesus  what did they say to you 
[01:28:00]  he told me  he says  you got who  I said  I got 9-1  oh yeah  he's talking about  the 9-1-1 operator  oh right  I got Amanda Berry  with me right now  sending the police  this dispatcher said  stop playing on this line  you don't got her  I said  well send the police  moron  and arrest me  if I'm lying  they took  they didn't believe me  now  now since so many people  have been calling them  probably through the years  and said we got her  I understand that you  were just a little apprehensive  about that call  she called too 
[01:28:30]  now you got two people  calling 9-1-1  at the same time  somebody can't be lying  how did Amanda look  when you finally rescued her  fine  she was  trembling  happy that she saw  someone else  other than  her  she was shaking  and if you want a good shit  but her main concern  was that child  I didn't know  what that baby  was crying about  did she come out  with the child  yes  and I was like 
[01:29:00]  who is this kid  and she said  well  this is his daughter  his daughter  and I'm like  well how  she had a grimace  on her face  you weren't pregnant  then  and then they  well  do the math  I said  oh damn  well  it's okay  that's alright  oh that's alright  that's alright  thank god  that's alright  that's alright  that's alright  the Cleveland guy  oh the stupid  Cleveland guy  we understand  I think the Cleveland guy  used to be in New York too  he looked very familiar  oh really  that's why the guy  was taking her to the park though 
[01:29:30]  it's his daughter too  to the park  yeah  how do you fucking  decipher that shit  in your little brain  yeah  yeah  they're taking daddy away  good lord  hit him with a bat  just hit him with a bat  hit the guy with a bat  she's gonna have a little bit  of baggage there  to deal with  a little few daddy issues  perhaps  daddy was a what  yeah  I'm here why  yeah  how did I come around  ugh  that's when Anthony  swoops in like a falcon  I smell daddy issues 
[01:30:00]  like a fucking  like a vulture  smells a carcass  and I react  much the same way  pick their  bones  clean of meat  exactly  it's illegal to vote  then you just drop them  somewhere  he talks about  being a hero  ah  let me ask you this  you touched on this earlier  has it  sunk in  just how much  attention you're getting  as Aaron was pointing out  earlier  you're trending  on twitter  the world is talking about  what you did  your name is all over the place 
[01:30:30]  it's a  hashtag  chuck ramsey  everywhere  do you have any idea  of the attention  that you're getting  around the world right now  I don't even want it  nor looking for it bro  that's why  when they keep saying  I'm a hero  let me tell you something  I'm American  and I'm a human being  a hero ain't nothing  but a sandwich  as is the big man  there was a woman  in distress  so why turn your back  on that  that dress  my father  would have whooped  the hell out of me  if he had found out  that I was  cowered out  see you tough 
[01:31:00]  in these bars  but you won't  and you beat a woman  but you won't help  one out  you're a man huh  no I'm the definition  of a man bro  were you ever concerned  that Ariel would come back  I am a man  yes  only because  I  was doing something  that I had no business doing  which was  prying his door open  on his property  so he had every right  to  you know  getting some type  of altercation with me  because I'm on  private property  even though I'm doing  a good deed  he's still on my property 
[01:31:30]  you understand what I'm saying  so I was thinking about him  but at the time  and I got  you know  I wish you'd bring  my squad with me  I got  I got an entourage  we weren't worried  about Ariel anyway  that's why I told the police  if we had known  about this  we would have never  got that call  it'd just been  some corners coming  putting a white sheet  over somebody  and we'd have went on  with our life  because we'd have  handled that bro  he's talking about that  yeah I'm a hero  I'm all nice and shit  but  this could have gone 
[01:32:00]  the other way  motherfucker  kung fu fighting  yeah  they found Ariel  at McDonald's  they really did  they honestly did  yes  that's hilarious  no fucking way  yes  that's coming in  Jesus  they got them  at McDonald's  man  that area  loves their McDonald's  holy fuck  well again  you know  the goat shit palace  is the only other place  yes  the only other option  it really gets a bum rap  the goat shit palace  yes it does  and now Charles Ramsey 
[01:32:30]  wants to get his hands  on the person  that did this  Ariel I believe  as you said  you have an entourage  and your manager  over there  is saying  you have to leave  but let me ask you  one last question  before you go  you talked about  you're not a hero  you were doing  what you had to do  knowing what you did  knowing the attention  that you're getting  knowing how grateful  people are  that because of you  these ladies  are now free  how do you feel today  oh I'm uh  I'm alright  I'm uh  I want to get my hands  on him  and then I'll be alright 
[01:33:00]  put me in the face  over there with him  and I'll be alright  other than that  I mean it is what it is bro  you know  God's smiling on somebody  you know what I mean  yeah  alright  hey Chuck  thanks man  oh yeah  we appreciate it  really appreciate it  good luck to you  you too bro  you gave him that personal touch  yeah  hey Chuck  good luck Chuck  Chuck  I feel  I feel like I won  that McDonald's  Monopoly game  they do every so often  I feel like I won  like the grand prize  of the motherfucker  how are you feeling

[01:34:00]  yes worst of 2013  my name is  E-Rock  and we're looking back  at the year that was  for the Opie and Anthony show  moving right along  we're up to a segment  about Mars  who we don't talk to  that much  because he usually  doesn't have that much  to add  but in this particular  segment he talks  about his mother  and tells some stories  about his childhood  and we tried to explain  to him that  he might have been  abused  Mars doesn't think so  but let's go through  this now  as we go through  part one  of Mars's  abusive mother 
[01:34:30]  I don't want to  I don't want to  hit my kids or anything  give them that  fucking fetish  right  I think as a parent  you're the one  that gives your kids  their fetishes  indirectly  don't you think  yes absolutely  you spank your  daughter a lot  guess what  I think she might  get into that  when she gets older  right  yep  that whole pulling  down the pants  and smacking  that's  it's bizarre  I can't even  imagine doing that  but even  I come from a 
[01:35:00]  generation where  that happened  but I can't  imagine as a  father like  I'm gonna pull  your pants now  and spank you  get the fuck  out of here  it's creepy  I used to get  my ass beat  yeah  beat  and I don't  touch my kids  man  you don't do  that shit  it's just wrong  you got beat  oh fuck  badly  yeah  yeah I got beat  badly  my family was a lot  of yelling  so I don't yell  at my kids  no I got hit  with extension cords  belts  extension cords  sucks  that's a rough one  wow  you were a bad kid  no she was a bad  mother  oh  you had a bad mom 
[01:35:30]  yeah  where's she now  she's in New Jersey  she's alive  I still deal with her  look you're uncomfortable  to this day  you're uncomfortable  why was she bad  she'd beat you a lot  she did a lot of  fucking things to me  that I got  wait do you have  a relationship with her  oh so you're  uncomfortable  because you're  scared this might  get back to her  I don't give a fuck  but no you do  you do  I see it in your eyes  what would she do  that was so bad  dude she burned my hands  how  with a spatula  why  on purpose  because I stole 
[01:36:00]  what'd you steal  some papers  papers from what  a ream of paper  what's a ream  I don't know what  a ream is  a ream  a ream  from her  no from school  why would you steal  paper from school  that's like the worst  thing to steal  a kid's stupid  yeah but what  what do you need  paper for  no reason  just to  kids want to  avoid paper  just the act of  stealing  that's all  how old were you  maybe nine  I think  she burned your hand  at nine  for just silly  shit 
[01:36:30]  the way she did  it too  man she got me  really good  she was acting  like she was  frying some eggs  she had me sit  next to her  on the stove  by the stove  and she told me  to put my hands  out for a second  I had no idea  this was coming  no idea  so I put my  hands out  and she takes  it  the spatula  was already  in the oil  in the frying pan  and she took it  straight from the  frying pan  and slapped my  hand  I moved one hand  left the other one  there  she got the other  one  burned both hands  badly  badly  nine 
[01:37:00]  I'm fucking  so mad right  now  I'm telling you  bro  I don't even  know her  let me tell you  I barely know  you  I went to  school  not by his  choice  I know  he might do  some things for  me though  soon  yeah  he might  help out  my TVs  and shit  and TV  time is so much  different nowadays  because I went to  school and no one  really  you had marks  on your hands  I had bandages  and stuff  and no one  really got into  the start  did she keep the  spatula down 
[01:37:30]  on your hands  or just kind of  slapped it  just slapped it  that's the damage  oh because the  oil was on it  yeah  so that oil  was what was  burning  the oil would  stay on  I'm sorry  yeah  if she takes  the spatula  out of the  hot oil  it's the oil  that's really  burning  and what did  she say  was like  this is for  stealing  Jimmy  to be honest  with you  I don't  remember  man  I don't  I just  remember the  action and how  much I  can't stand  now what else  did your family  your family  the rest of them  react to that  or no  do you get all  freaky when people 
[01:38:00]  are flying  do you like  fried food  wait  no  I hate fried  food  and yes  they reacted  and they  you know  sorry  they told her  you know  it's not right  shouldn't be doing  this but no one  really stepped up  to the plate  and you know  did anything else  was she mentally  ill  no she's got  some issues  though  she's got to  have some  issues  she's a nasty  individual  yeah  who'd she live  with  with her  with her husband  your dad  no  of course not  you're Puerto Rican  I forgot  you guys go through 
[01:38:30]  a few  right  yeah  but she  yeah  I've been through  some  wait your stepdad  was he nice to you  oh he's  fucking saint  yeah that's usually  the case right  saint  usually the case  you get one  whacked out  fucking parent  and the other  one's the saint  yes  yeah she did  a lot of shit  you really can't  stand her  so you  I have my moments  so you tolerate her  does she come to your house  do you do holidays  with her still  yeah she came  about two weeks ago  and what  do you get all  like all fucked up  when she comes  into your house  no I try  I forget about  all that shit 
[01:39:00]  now I know why  you're like  a MMA training guy  but  right  yeah  but when she starts  with her ignorant shit  because you know  a lot of these people  are ignorant  then I get it  what's her ignorant  what does she do  as ignorant  like if I invite you  at two  you wind up  coming at the house  at three  and then act like  it's no big deal  if I invite you  and say hey  how many of you guys  come in  I need a number  just so I could prepare  yeah  she thinks it's probably  a little too white of me  and  it doesn't matter  how many people I bring  so then now  let's say I have a kids party 
[01:39:30]  Mars has OCD  because he got hit  in the hands  with hot oil  that's OCD shit  who gives a fuck  probably  but you also want to know  it also  when you're hosting  you want to know  yeah but how many people  is she bringing  instead of two  she's bringing three  and that bothers you  or is it  or is it she bringing  in the whole fucking neighborhood  well check it out  we're creating a nice  birthday party  for the kids  does she ruin it  and we want to go ahead  and give goodie bags  to other kids  you know  we're pretty  we're very good like that  gotcha  okay  so I ask you  how many kids  are you bringing  none  okay  kids come

[01:40:30]  wow  she's a narcissist  probably  she tries  she makes it about herself  right  all the time  that's what my mom  did my entire life  she comes to the fucking house  and she will sit there  and she'll start asking me  where are the Spanish channels  on the fucking cable  so then I gotta go  and find the Spanish channel  so she can watch  her fucking telenovelas  well she's in my house  she hasn't been around for  bro you have no idea  holy fuck  you guys have no idea  what's going on right now  you have no idea  he's all dry mouth  Jimmy just gave him water  his eyes have changed  well she's obviously  a narcissist  he grew up with a narcissist

[01:41:30]  I right away tell her  that there's no way  that I would ever marry  a Hispanic woman  why  we've been through this before  well the reason is  obviously because  if it's her  he hates her  so he doesn't want to  marry someone who's  like his mom  which is probably normal  probably because  she turned to shit  after the two kids  her body turned  into a disaster zone  so I was like  I don't want a woman  like that  that doesn't take  care of herself  after having kids  and now my wife  takes great care of herself  but it's also  because she was nasty  too  Mars is really fucked up  right now  yeah he's crazy  I wasn't expecting this 
[01:42:00]  she made me kneel  on a  we have this  you know  pasteles  no  okay  pasteles is  there's got to be  a dangerous word for that  they  they wrap it in plantain leaves  and it's  plantains  blended together  with meat in it  and it's  over the Christmas  it's a big dish  well that thing  back in the day  because we didn't have  food processors  back in the day  the grater  grate like this  the cheese grater  yeah cheese grater 
[01:42:30]  I guess  it's about  your high  yeah yeah  your high  you're showing  yeah I'm sorry  about  ten inches  off the table  ten inches  and  that cunt  made me  kneel on that shit  she made you kneel  on it  yes  for what  I don't know man  whatever you say  for what  I don't know  I just know  that  yeah  she made me  kneel on that shit  for a long time  it seemed long to me  it's hard to put  your two knees  with all your weight  on that shit  and that was your  punishment  yeah and I would  I would cheat  I would take one leg 
[01:43:00]  off and she would  come and smack me  and I had to  what a sick fuck  man  you know I get  yelled at a lot  my shit was more  like a  emotional shit  but I didn't get  shit like that  I don't think  I wasn't blocking  that out  I'll tell you about  the MMA shit  look at your eyes  you alright  yeah I'm getting  a little up there  but the MMA shit  I'll tell you  one day she caught  me after school  and it was just  her and I  and this woman  actually put her  hands up  and said  we're gonna fight  I'm gonna fuck 
[01:43:30]  you up  she said that  to you  I'm serious  I'm not bullshit  maybe this is 12  this is exhausting  oh my god  dude  Joe  dude  do you have  whatever the fuck  I did  we're gonna fight  I'm serious  can you imagine  going home to that  type of unpredictability  well  I guess you probably  could  I'm not gonna make  I could so make  this about myself  I won't  we'll do it another day  yes I can imagine  Sam  it's the answer  but it was different  in my house  go ahead  so she's 
[01:44:00]  we're gonna fight  yeah she's pissed  whatever the fuck  I did  she puts up her hands  and says we're gonna  fight  and I said what are you  doing  you're my mother  she said I'm gonna  fuck you up  you better block  why did she want  to fuck you up  I don't know  was she a drunk  no  but you have to  no drugs  no drugs at all  and no drinking  and that's why I think  drugs are great  people like her  fucking no drugs  give me a break  she's a drug addict  huh  I smoke my weed  drug addict  no  and you'd love  to get her  to smoke some weed  and fucking relax  a little bit  yeah  or take something 
[01:44:30]  that's fucking  for being bipolar  or whatever it is  wait a minute  so hold on though  man you gotta know  why she wanted  to fight you  that day  yeah  dude I've been  so many altercations  with her  I have no idea  what do you think  it was about  some dumb  little stupid thing  yeah misbehaving  were you a bad  kid growing up  no  I mean the nine year old  stealing the paper  that seems like  more normal  that's all I did  I'm just growing up shit  that's it  simple things like that  alright that's why  I'm trying to like  establish something  you weren't a bad kid  you weren't like  fucking dealing drugs 
[01:45:00]  none of that shit  you pretty much  listened to what  she told you to do  exactly  okay  because I get that  feeling that you  were that type of kid  you know  which makes this shit  worse by the way  that's why I'm  establishing it  just a little  fist fights  with my friends  perhaps you know  a little stealing  here and there  nothing really bad  nothing  now smoking  came later  not during this time  so anyhow  she commences  and starts  swinging on me  and she knocks me down  and you remember  back in the day guys 
[01:45:30]  back when you were  growing up  we had these  big stereo systems  with the two speakers  on the side  the record player  in the middle  the radio  and the TV  okay  she didn't go  WWE on you  did she  dude  when she knocks me down  I go underneath  the stereo system  and it had a little ledge  so my head goes in  sideways  right  but she mounts me  so I turn  my head is facing  directly upward  yeah  so now my head is stuck  right  you're crammed under there  yes  and this bitch is 
[01:46:00]  fucking me up  she's punching me  and looking at me  with her eyes going  huh  huh  huh  can you go  in the face  what the fuck  god damn  yep  she was an abusive  shitty narcissist  you're never coming  to my house  why  that shit's gonna come out  that's bullshit  because now with my kids  I am the best thing  there is man  let me tell you  I love my children  I would never ever  I would tug  you know like  I'd perhaps smack them  in the back of the head 
[01:46:30]  one time  but nothing  you would challenge them  to a fist fight  a knife fight  maybe  we're getting a fist fight  imagine coming home  and having to put your dukes up  and she squares off  and let's go  that's why you do MMA shit  it's so obvious  why do you deal with her  at all at this point  like why not just  like I don't understand  why you deal with your mom  like you're an adult  like you cut her out  fuck her  yeah I barely deal with mine  because I can't deal with  cut her  there's one way to handle that  it is to cut them out  like a cancer  but then you got a  a decent wife 
[01:47:00]  that wants to have  the grandparents  involved in the life  and you try  and I'm trying  how does she treat your children  now my wife  is getting the idea  now she's beginning  to realize  is she still a twat  your mom  when she comes over  yeah but now  she's into the church  she's like going to church  every day  and you know  now she's thinking  you think she has some guilt  absolutely  yeah  does she ever acknowledge  the things that she did  no  yeah  they rarely do 
[01:47:30]  they rarely do  they can reason  they can give you  some reasoning  for anything they've done  it was the time  let me tell you  something else  down by wall  wait wait wait  was there  was there like a man  in the house  yes my father  he would never put his hands  on me  your father father  yes  and I bet you  he just allowed her  to just wreak havoc  right  yes  what do you think  that's about  he said that  if he were to put  his hands on me  he would kill me  because he was a  bodybuilder  no but why did he  allow your mom  to do that shit  because I 
[01:48:00]  I wonder that  I guess he was  probably either  fucking around  I don't know  he didn't care  he didn't care  but that wasn't  unusual back then  he pretty much  looked the other way  though when your mom's  like we're gonna fight  like was he in the house  when he  no  no that particular  incident  the hand burning  incident  all those really  serious incidents  no one else  was in the house  her sadistic stuff  she was alone with  so he was  he was usually out  when she would do  what was the other  thing she did  we were at  I said Wall Street 
[01:48:30]  my bad  it was one  center street  we were going to  court for some reason  I forget what it was  right  and it's fucking  bitter cold  I'm talking about  what it was  a couple of days ago  cold  right  we're outside  and she  and we're  I'm telling  it's freezing  and she looks at me  and I don't know  what I said  or what I did  those things  I can't recall  it must have been  something not so good  but she tells me  if you cut my  your eyes at me  once more  I'm gonna smack  you in this cold  I guess 
[01:49:00]  I cut my eyes  man  cause that fucking  bitch hit me  so hard  and let me tell you  when your face  is freezing cold  yeah  yeah  I will remember that  for the rest of my life  man  that's for getting  hit in the ice cold  is the fucking  worst  you got tears  in your eyes man  I'd fucking  bother us a little bit  no that's alright  it's not easy  like that  like  you know  what I  put up with  when I was a kid  and now that I'm a father  that's when it kills you  like you look at your kids  and go 
[01:49:30]  I can't even imagine  like doing any of this shit  to my kids  right  yeah  and I'm sorry to say  a lot of this  Latino bullshit  like for example  today I saw a fucking video  of a fucking kid  getting tattooed  right  put  a mother's  actually having a tattoo artist  put a tattoo  on a fucking baby  how old  I don't know  three  how old's the baby  less than two  less than two  what kind of tattoo  Brostar  Brostar 
[01:50:00]  yeah  what kind of tattoo  I don't know  I don't give a fuck  I was so angry  fuck wife  and it's gonna be stupid  because he's gonna grow up  and the fucking tattoo  is gonna stretch  right  is that something  that's happening  in the community  I don't know  it's something  that means something  to the mother  that will mean  nothing to the baby  right  it's just again  more self-centeredness  by a parent  Marge did you ever ask her  what  did you know her father  her parents  yes  I knew her father  he was a barber  he was pretty rough with them  so she kind of got beat up  so yeah 
[01:50:30]  the cycle continues  yeah  he used to beat her up  all of them up  so you're breaking the cycle  yeah absolutely  being broken  is this real  this is real  what the fuck  is this world star hip hop yo  yo  let's see this shit  what is this  cunt  getting tattooed  on the baby  and why  would a tattoo artist  accept this  he needs business  this bad  is that reggaeton  in the background 
[01:51:00]  reggaeton  how traumatic  why is this happening  what a fucking  cunt  she's holding  the kid down  how awful  just so she can  show her kid off  I  I  you know  I  this shit 
[01:51:30]  follows me  so fucking much  what a terrible  fucking  cunt  of a woman  you know  before I had kids  it wouldn't bother me  as much  this  I  fuck  what's wrong  with people  the fuck  is wrong  with people  what kind  of tattoo  is this  it'll mean  something to her  like this  self-centered  bitch  what's the description  on this video  nothing  why the fuck  would you do  that to your  kid  there's no  explanation for that  I don't give a shit  what it is 
[01:52:00]  what culture  you're in  you don't do  that shit  to a child  he has  he has  no concept  that's just  a completely  traumatic experience  it's all about her  it's all about her  and what she wants  so she can show him off  so she can talk about it  it's just  what the fuck  is that about  does anyone know  no  is that something  that's now going on  no definitely not  it's probably been  happening forever though  like when you look at  the tribes  you look at  you look at tribes  in the way kids  are tattooed  or whatever  I'm sure that's common  but you know  not in modern day living 
[01:52:30]  it shouldn't be  yeah it's not like a trend  right no  oh my god  I still want to know  why Mars doesn't cut  his mother out of his life  like I said  it's tough  because you know  you realize in the end  it's your mom  so it's a weird thing  no I could easily  cut people off  trust me  no you can't  because she's still  in your life  you've only given us  three things  that are horrific  I'm sure there's others  it's really because  of my wife  she squares off  and says let's fight  my wife is the  very decent individual  that wants grandma  to be part of  she just wants everyone 
[01:53:00]  to get along  and she doesn't understand  I tell my wife  the same stuff  I'm like don't worry about  I'm like our kids  have two great  grandparents  in Philly  don't worry about  making this work  because it's not  going to work  and I'm cool with it  I make it better  I tell her  you don't want  that fucking element  in your life  in your kid's life  growing up  your wife's trying  to do the right thing  she doesn't understand  there's one way  to do it  that is to cut them  out completely  and the wives  don't understand  you gotta tell them  you don't get it  I'm not gonna hurt  the kid  because you don't get it 
[01:53:30]  I grew up with  one grandma  and she was  beyond amazing  and I had  another quote  grandma alive  that we never saw  which we've talked  about a lot  on this show  but I had  one amazing grandma  that's all I know  and I'm totally fine  with that  that's all you need  I'm completely fine  with that  she was amazing  she made up  for everything else  as far as  grandparents go  yeah  what happened  to your real dad  by the way  oh I don't know  they broke up  and I haven't heard  from him 
[01:54:00]  for years now  what year did he leave  like how old were you  like 10 or 11  I was  I was about  19, 20  oh you were an adult  I was already  I got this whole thing  figured out  okay  your mom hated  your father  she couldn't stand him  and you looked like  your father  absolutely  mirror image  that's  I'm a mirror image  that happens a lot  and then  you look like your father  who she fucking hated  for whatever reason  he was cheating  or doing whatever  he did her wrong  in her fucking stupid mind 
[01:54:30]  and you look just like  the dude  so she took it out  on you  because she really  wanted to take it  out on him  and I also have  a little bit  of his attitude  so  right  that doesn't help  he just disappeared  he probably got  no he got fed up  they got divorced  clean you know  but why wouldn't  he keep in touch  with you  he's an asshole  he's another asshole  you don't like him  no he's an asshole  another one  I had two assholes  rearing me  bringing me up  but he just didn't  hit you  no he didn't hit me  he was just  but he was done  when you were 19  dude  I don't remember 
[01:55:00]  getting a hug  and a kiss  from my father  and I don't want  to make this  a hoo hoo hoo  but I haven't  I've never  kissed my father  zero affection  zero affection bro  or a hug  do you know how much  I hug and kiss  my boy man  did he want to  kiss him on the lips  no  he did  you could tell  a little bit  but see you don't  do that shit man  you want a hug  just to see how  no not from you  I didn't say from me  I was gonna find  someone to hug you  you implied it  no I don't want  to hug you  I didn't find you  a hug  do you want 
[01:55:30]  to hug you  or no  rarely  coldly  oh  yeah  it was  yeah  my parents  were fucked up  they weren't  they didn't take drugs  the sons of bitches  I can't say  they were  lacking  and going  they were going  to work  they were  on time  they were there  every day  one was a bodybuilder  they kept me  in catholic school  who was a bodybuilder  my father  oh so he was  on the steroids  probably  he was a pretty  big guy  so you know 
[01:56:00]  I don't know  probably  I don't give a fuck  did he hit her  I saw that happen  you don't know  I don't know  if it was a hit  but I saw that  when I was a little  kid she was  crying on the floor  and screaming  and crying  he left  and I don't know  what that was about  perhaps it was a hit  I don't know  but never ever  after that  I was real little  he would never  do things like that  he would say  he was too big  too strong  to put his hands  on us  so he wouldn't  were your parents  young when they  had you  I think so 
[01:56:30]  yeah  relatively young  20s  that's not too young  well early 20s  you know  yeah that was  more commonplace  for a man of your age  I'm like  not feeling right  right now  well it's weird  to talk about stuff  because it's coming out  don't you ever wonder  what happened to him  not really  because dude  I  there was a lot  that I miss  from a father  a lot  a lot  you know  throwing  I mean  just  I don't know 
[01:57:00]  just  I don't know  you know  like you teach a kid  like he would teach  he taught me  not to get into fights  meanwhile  here comes bully  and fucking  cracks me in the eye  and I've come home  with a fucking black eye  oh you're gonna start  martial arts school  tomorrow  why  why couldn't you start  from the beginning  you know  with your son  anybody  you know  puts his hands on you  you know  things like that  like my son  he didn't give you  any lessons  no lessons  no lessons in life  you know 
[01:57:30]  nothing like that  and he didn't protect you  from the fucking bully  no  your mother  he did come through  one time  with a bully  but that's another  what did he do  when I was getting  16  17  I got into  I got jumped  and  you grew up in a  bad neighborhood  Washington Heights  that's pretty bad  it's pretty bad  not as bad as  you know  there's worse places  yes  yeah  but Washington Heights  you can find a lot of things  you know  so  anyhow  so this guy 
[01:58:00]  beats me up  along with his buddies  and Jose was his name  fuck him  we don't  we don't know his last name  but fuck him  he's a dirt bag  anyway  and I went back home  aisle bloodied up  I was  broken arm  and my father  you had a broken arm  yeah  it was  that  the broken arm  was from hitting  from hitting him  I didn't hit right  I hit him in the  top of the head  I busted my  like Anthony  when he hit  Boomer Sison  when he was a kid  broke one of your bones  and your wrist  so then 
[01:58:30]  so then when I went home  I told my father  and he got pretty pissed  and he heard of Jose  and where he hung out  and he went over there  you know  and scared the shit  out of all of them  they all saw this big guy  coming  ready to fuck him up  that was about it  so they never bothered you again  no  no  no  I  no  I tried  tried getting mine back  but he went to jail  oh okay  for what  who the fuck knows  he was a dust head  you know  PCP  Jesus Mars 
[01:59:00]  what  fuck  so your mom's still  mom lives in Jersey now  so she's still close  unfortunately  yeah  20 minutes away  and that's too long  that's too much for her to drive  do you have to pick her up  or do people come  fuck no  that won't happen  that won't happen  oh she tells you  yeah  she has no interest  in your grandkids  I would assume  no man  my little girl  Olivia  she's always asking for her  and this fucking bitch  see that's why  you know what  it's better they don't know  yeah exactly  my kids won't know  so they won't be asking  yes  honey  listen  I can talk to your wife 
[01:59:30]  I know I can  there's no need for that bitch  to be in my life man  or in my kids life  you know  and then the kids are asking  because they don't know  all this shit  look  let me  let me  let me  let me  let me give you  another insight  right  they're still like  you know  back in the day  type of shit  they don't make  that much money  so they live in an apartment  so this woman  oh she's gonna hate  when I say this  this woman right  she's so fucking  yeah  she's so fucking lazy  that she won't go  to the bathroom  so she has one of those 
[02:00:00]  spit tunes  white  spackle buckets  almost like a bedpan  yeah bedpan  but you know  it's got  it's got that white covering  to put in  you know what I mean  it's white and blue  is it made for peeing in  yeah  some shit like that  okay  so okay  so she'd rather  piss in there  than go  20 feet  to the bathroom  okay  that's your business  I don't give a shit  that's your life  no you can't even downplay  that's fucking weird  it is weird  how long has you been doing that  I'm going to 
[02:00:30]  all her life  all her life  so  okay  so that's her business  she'd rather  wait a minute  she'd rather pee  in like  let's just call it  a bedpan type of thing  instead of go to the bathroom  in the middle of the night  what she do it in front of people  no in the middle of the night  I'm sorry  in the middle of the night  this is for when she sleeps  I'm sorry  is she fat  no  is she really lazy  or do you think that  when her father would get a hold of her  when she'd go to the bathroom  when she was a kid  so she learned to fucking  just piss in her room  I never analyzed that  that's based on something  Jimmy's right  that's just too weird 
[02:01:00]  so  in the middle of the night  she won't go to the bathroom  she'd rather  do that  there in that  bedpan  does she get out of bed  to do this  yes of course  so if you're getting out of bed  why wouldn't you go to the bathroom  I don't know  anyhow  so my point is this  I tell my wife  I explain that to her  and I says  do you really want  your kids  to go and see that shit  in the morning  because she has to transport  that pee  and piss  and whatever  to the bathroom  do you really think  you want your fucking kids  to see that shit  well I don't  so they never stay there  you know 
[02:01:30]  that's gross  that type of shit  if they stay there  who else stays there with her  her husband  what do you mean  if they stay there  if like they stay for an overnight  yeah but you're not there  oh no that doesn't happen  yeah exactly  why would you do that  the kids don't go there  without you right  no  so why does the husband  tolerate you think  probably gives up  some good shit  that's why  he used to have  an outhouse too  back when he grew up  so he's probably used  to that kind of shit  you know 
[02:02:00]  right  but her nastiness  I don't know why  he puts up with it  is she dirty  nah she's very clean  she's very clean  except for the pee  all over the place  she is very clean  in the bedroom  fucking peeing herself  instead of going in the bedroom  it's just fucking ridiculous  I can't believe  I'm talking about this  I get some shit  out of people  yeah  she probably doesn't  listen to the show  she can't fucking  even speak English  she doesn't speak English  all these years  lazy  lazy  not gonna learn  lives in her community  where they all speak Spanish 
[02:02:30]  science of Spanish  you know  the fucking TV Spanish  she doesn't need  to speak English  she thinks you're  a little sellout  from a white girl  and for fucking  whitening up your life  I'm the worst  I'm the worst  I went to college  I make good money  you know  I live in a very nice  neighborhood  you know  that's another thing  I invite  okay  whoa  slow down  Mars  turning you into  the Mars show  alright good  you know  I invite them over  to come over  to the neighborhood  like to do  trick or treating  you know  Halloween and shit  you know  it's too much 
[02:03:00]  for them  it's  the way they act  it's not  too much  for them  because they drive over  it's too much  for them  to deal with  people of our caliber  who's them  whites  you live in a white  neighborhood  Mars you live  in a white  neighborhood  oh no  my sister  oh your sister's  on your mom's side  a little bit  just a little bit  she's trying to get  away from that  I live in a white  neighborhood  you think they're  jealous  that you have  this nice life  and they have to  go back  it's like  sometimes you don't  want to go  somewhere nice  then it's a relative 
[02:03:30]  comparison  to what you have  okay I agree with that  if that is the case  then if you have  a niece or a nephew  or a grandchild  then I tell you  bring her over  so she can you know  grow up with my kids  and hang out  in this area  but just get a little  out of that  Newark shit  no  it just  they make up excuses  and all that  so I'm like okay  that little kid  is gonna grow up  to be  it's you know  a luck of the draw  just a shitty group  it is  it is  Charis  you got a good  family it sounds like 
[02:04:00]  I know  but then you  give a fuck  about everyone else  yeah but you got  a little baby girl  there that could  use some help  you know  and I see it  you know  wait  whose baby  my sister's  oh  oh  you're worried  about her kids  I was like  you know  bring her over  bring her over  show her the white world  show her where the rich  people live  the beautiful white world  does your sister  live in poverty  no  Newark  no no  they live okay  but it's in Newark  it's the neighborhood  stinks  I hear you  so you wish a little  better for your 
[02:04:30]  your niece  yeah this is the type  of place  like you don't see  this where you live  obviously  but where pit bulls  with their masters  are roaming the streets  but with no leash  and you got a fucking  two year old  running around  what's that like  is that like  a ghetto statement  like I can control  this dog  without it being  on a leash  I think so  it's ridiculous  no one curbs  their dog  no one cleans up  after their dog  you know  that type of stuff  but your sister's  fine living like that  she's got no choice  I guess  she's a single mom 
[02:05:00]  no  what does the father do  he works  he does work  that's  that's fucking  interesting man  it really is  very interesting  oh man  we're gonna  the best part  is we're gonna fight  that's crazy  there's enough shit  to deal with  as a 12 year old  you're trying to  figure out  what the fuck's  going on  and now you gotta  go home  and square off  with your own mom 
[02:05:30]  I can remember  like  trying to avoid  bullies  and being like  oh I can't wait  to just get home  and then I'm safe  until tomorrow  right  I can't imagine  but you were  you were brought up  in a relatively  good neighborhood  man  what bullies  were fucking with you  at school  everybody  you know  every bunch of people  at school  yeah so you get home  and you're like  okay I'm in these  four walls  everything is cool  because I'm at home  and you get home  and when you get home  is when this woman  is saying  oh my god  yo we're gonna fight  put your  I love 
[02:06:00]  I love  hearing from  like guys like Sam  that have no idea  he had like  a really like  good upbringing  in his house  my house was  the wild wild west  it was way safer  to be out of the house  are you kidding me  me too  I used to be the one  I feared when that sun  started going down  I'm like oh fuck  and maybe this was  a product of that  yeah  but I was doing  more of the  bullying  and being mischievous  at school  and starting fights  and things like that  I wasn't  when I used the 
[02:06:30]  term bully  before  when I got  hit in the eye  that wasn't really  a bullying  he tried  and I stepped to him  like fuck you  he was a lot bigger  than me  but got my ass kicked  but it wasn't  really a bullying  action  like no one  really bullied me  you know  I had this bitch  at home  ain't nobody  bullying me  I'm gonna take abuse  at home  there's no fucking way  I'm gonna take abuse  from anyone else  so maybe that's  about it  yeah  this is a very good  question coming in  from Cigars and Scotch 
[02:07:00]  Cigars  hey what's going on guys  hey man  who was your toughest  training sparring partner  was it an MMA fighter  or an M-O-M-M-A fighter  the latter  she was tough  makes sense  that you train now  you know  no one's gonna  fuck with Mars anymore  I never thought about it  at what age  did you realize  no one's gonna  fuck with Mars anymore  oh young man  I was young  I was  yeah I was still  in the house  everyone's going  with the M-O-M-M-A 
[02:07:30]  joke  it's funny  we have a match today  Joe and Jersey  have the same  fucking line  yeah you wanna go  Maury  we know Maury  I'm not a sob story  bro  I'm not a sob story  I'm just  talking  let me say  how to  I don't know  Ken in Chicago  looks like  Ken what's up  hey what's going on man  hey  Ken  hey you know  I just wanted to  give a call man  cause it was funny  I just turned you guys on  and I was listening  it was like listening  to myself  talking on the radio  man 
[02:08:00]  with the story  you're upbringing  man I can totally  relate to you  and I can tell you  one thing  if I've learned  nothing from life  man  when people are  stuck in situations  like that growing up  man it either  breaks you  or makes you  and obviously  much like myself  you know  I came from  a house  where my mother  was very successful  in the medical field  here in Chicago  and she was  nothing but a pill popper  and abusing  morphine patches  and my father  was kind of a dissident  you know  here and there  and you know  that made me  the person I am  I bought my house  when I was 19  I got two young kids 
[02:08:30]  a beautiful wife  that I can cherish  and like you man  you gotta judge  the situation  and with my mom  and my dad  I didn't want  that effect  on my children  so I cut them  off completely  now and now  I thank God  I have the wonderful  grandparents  for my kids  through my wife  and I can do  nothing but congratulating  man for making it  through what you have  man  thanks man  I would love to  talk to a psychologist  about it  because what motivates you  because like you said 
[02:09:00]  and Mars has said  I got some similar  shit too  you either  it either breaks you  and you follow  the same path  and you don't break  the fucking chain  of abuse  whether it's physical  or emotional  or you go  completely the other way  and say fuck that  I'm not doing this  to my kids  it stops right here  what's the  what's the turning point  for people  where they can decide  I'll do the same shit  because this is all I know  or I'm gonna fucking  do it different  because I've had it 
[02:09:30]  I would love a psychologist  to answer that question  no I mean  for me  by all means  man I was  you know  I party all the time  partied hard  I never touched  any type of illegal drugs  because I kind of saw  what it did to my mom  I never did any type  of drugs whatsoever  but to stop you  other people  would do drugs  because that's all they know  yeah you know  I guess I've seen  my defective  in my mom  because literally  for about a 10 year span  up until I moved  out of my house  basically from the age  of 9 to 19  I watched my mom  and saw her  about 5 minutes a day  she would go to work  before we woke up 
[02:10:00]  she would come home  at 5, 6 o'clock  in the afternoon  she would go directly  into her bedroom  and go to sleep  and that was my experience  that was my  total experience  with my mother  for 10 years  right  and by seeing  what it did to her  that's what drove me  not to do it  but I think the biggest  thing in my life  man was just  all the hardships  and seeing how  I guess ultimately  selfish my parents were  you know  they would  they would deprive  me and my  my sisters  of things  that were basic things  like hey dad  you know  my shoes are worn out  can I get a new pair  I'll go to  State of Asian Army  meanwhile  he's sitting there 
[02:10:30]  he's buying  another truck  for his company  or something like that  something that was  unnecessary  and I saw that  since I've had my daughter  my daughter was born  April 11, 2006  and she was 4 pounds  7 ounces  she was in the  neonatal intensive care unit  for almost 40 days  and on top of it all  I had a lapse of insurance  because I was between jobs  so I was stuck  with $270,000  in medical debt  almost blocked my house  you know  we went through negotiations  to drop it  but you know  when I was really hard up  and I was on the verge  of losing my house  you know  my mom 
[02:11:00]  like I said  she's up there  as part of the medical field  in Chicago  she makes a lot of money  and I asked my mom  you know  even though our relationship  was rocky  you know  mom can you lend me  $3,000  just so I can make it  come back  I said I'll pay you back  within a month  I'll do side jobs  work whatever I have to do  if I need the money now  and she looked at me  dead in the eye  and said  me and your father  did it  you can do it too  and that was it  and walked away  yeah  and you know what  I just thought to myself  you know what  I'm not going to be that parent  I'm going to give my children  everything they need 
[02:11:30]  not everything they want  but everything they need  in life  that they deserve  and you obviously  I work  typically on an average week  60-65 hours a week  on call for 24 coverage  24-7 coverage  for my company  I have almost 3 months  that I'm on call this year  I'll put that time in  so I can give my family  the thing they need  you know my children  are going to Catholic school  my son's got a speech disability  we hire a private speech therapist  to come to the house  and invest the money  in my children  instead of taking it away  from like it was to me  you know 
[02:12:00]  I guess I look at the reflection  and try to think to myself  I don't want to be that person  you know  and obviously it's worked for you man  because you hear the things  that you've gone through  and look at how far  you've come now  you know  you've taken all the negative energy  and put it towards something  that was worthwhile  and made something of yourself  you know  I want to congratulate you  you just  that was the longest sentence ever  longest sentence ever  called Guinness Book of World Records  holy shit  what pisses me off about your story 
[02:12:30]  you didn't put yourself  in that horrible financial spot  I could see if you did it to yourself  then maybe  you know  a parent would go  look man  you got yourself into this mess  you got to get yourself out  oh yeah  you didn't do that to yourself  I think we're learning  you needed desperate help there  we're learning  is you have to be a good boy  when you're growing up  and bad boys like Mars  and this man  just make things difficult  for the adults  so be a good boy  good for you Ken  thanks Ken  I appreciate it  it's good to hear stories  like that man  and everybody out there  can't just kind of bring 
[02:13:00]  push through man  you make it  alright Ken  thanks buddy  hey Ope  you know what I did realize  and Ken could probably  attest to this  you grow up a lot faster  mentally  like I remember  crying in front of the mirror  no one hated me  just fucking looking at myself  crying  going  I deserve a better childhood  I'm growing up too fast  because I know  what's going on  right now  shouldn't be happening to me  what is it going to take  to get you to cry today  because that would be great radio  tough guy like you  Puerto Rican guy like you  you break down and cry 
[02:13:30]  my eyes were watery before  I know  I almost had you  I was working it too man  until you said something  what did I say  I made some dumb joke  right  no you said  your eyes are watery  or some shit like that  and that was it  you never acknowledged it  you acknowledged it  and that's what  fucking put you on  god damn it  damn it  I almost had him  what's it going to take today  when was the last time  your mom hit you  shit I can't remember  that far  no  long time ago  yeah buddy  I wasn't molested at all 
[02:14:00]  alright  and you know  funny thing about all this  yeah  I don't ever think of it  as child abuse  why  I don't know  well now you do  don't you  I think  yeah  anything you wouldn't do  to your own child  that's child abuse  you know  the reason  things you know  happen to you  that you wouldn't do  to your own kid  probably that means  that's child abuse  okay I was thinking of it  because she was using it  as a corporate punishment  just punishment  that's what I deserve  plus no one wants  to see themselves 
[02:14:30]  as an abused child  no one wants to look  at themselves  like I was that  kid that they talk about  I was douchey  you just got beat up  I was douchey  by a woman  but you don't want to  see themselves like that  so you walked in the house  and she goes  we're fighting  yeah  yeah  well she let me put my  things down  and all that shit  and you guys just have  normal conversations now  yeah  ah  so fucking weird  but not because of me man  I don't  if it was up to me  I would not even deal  with her at all 
[02:15:00]  ex-wife  I mean  the wife  you know  she's just  she's a nice person  ah you're a good person too  Mars  yeah  she just doesn't understand  kind of a sellout  but a nice person  why am I a sellout  you know  the Puerto Rican thing  you're kind of giving up  and whitened up  I don't understand  you can punch him  no  people are asking  why haven't you called  Mars' mom yet  that's up to you  I don't know Spanish though  she doesn't understand  the language  and she'll play it off  like she doesn't understand  what's going on 
[02:15:30]  totally  because I'm sure  she understands a lot  but she won't be good radio  no  why do it in Spanish  someone will get it  have a five minute conversation  with your mom about this  but you know  I don't  I don't  I don't know how to speak Spanish  so we're gonna have to find somebody  that's great  he's not good at it  I'm not good at it  he's forgotten it  you have a mom  that doesn't read  that's another thing  wait  how do you communicate with your mom  if she doesn't know English  and you don't know Spanish  I speak Spanish  but it's broken  it's dirty  it's dirty Spanish  that's another thing  she watches all these  fucking telenovelas 
[02:16:00]  where they speak  great Spanish  high Spanish  and she always gives me  the junk  dialect  you know  I mean we fuck up  so many words in Spanish  it's incredible  when I speak to another person  South American  they're like  what  the fuck is that  some of that street  dirty Spanish  right  and you can't even say  it's Puerto Rican  because you have  Puerto Ricans that are  very well educated  listen to me  and they go  dude  you're not speaking  you know  like Puerto Rican  speak  it's just fucked up  alright 
[02:16:30]  well  thank you Marsh  you're welcome  sorry  that was great  what do you mean sorry  you stepped up to the plate today  well  you know  I put the show  in a fucking somber mood  the worst is yet to come  this is so fucked up man  this is ONA's worst of 2013  on the O.B. Anthony channel  yeah  this is O.B. Anthony's worst of 2013  what's up Roddy  hey buddy  did you get the red carpet treatment 
[02:17:00]  oh yeah  I told Mars to roll out the red carpet today  well  since he's abused  it's hard  red with his beaten blood  I told him  I go man  a lot of people related to you  yesterday Mars  he goes  bruh  I didn't even realize  I was abused  until I saw your eyes  I'm like  how do you not realize  you're being abused  when you take a hot oil spatula  to your hands  but he learned  he learned  he didn't steal anymore  he did learn 
[02:17:30]  yeah  mean but effective  the only thing that  that takes Mars back now  is if he hears Spanish  if anyone yells in Spanish  he just starts crying  well  it now makes sense though  because over the years  you know  we've need the Spanish guy  every once in a while  to translate something  maybe say something  and every time he tries on our show  people call up and go  he doesn't know how to speak Spanish  he speaks baby Spanish  he speaks baby Spanish  but now we know why  it sets his mom off  because she only knows Spanish  I had a buddy in Florida 
[02:18:00]  that I thought spoke Spanish  but when other Spanish people  they would tell me later  and he was like a big dude  they would say  he talks like a toddler  like a little kid  but to me it sounded like  perfect  it sounded great  yeah but it's because  shit like their grandparents  or whatever said to them  and then they got to school  right  and that part of them  never improved  right  and they need a hot spatula  in the back  yeah right  in the back of the hands  I don't know if that's abuse  do you really think  hot  a hot oiled spatula 
[02:18:30]  I mean no one's ever died  from a hot oiled spatula  let's do it then  I want E-Rock to do it  E-Rock  we'll get a hot plate  what do you think  for Ronnie B  and the eye bag  oh we'll put this right up  you're going to be perfect for you  come on  let's do it for the eye bag  it's a super weak  okay  no you'll get a couple  like drops of oil  that might burn a little more  than the spatula itself  great pictures  he's thinking about it  E-Rock  here's the thing  he's thinking about it  you know we leave here today 
[02:19:00]  we're heading to New Orleans  to be part of Radio Row  and we want to show  wait what  what's going on  yeah we're all going  the whole station  we're going to be in Radio Row  what really  and 150 other radio shows  all lined up  that's my dream  we're really going  that's my dream  have you ever done Radio Row before  yes I have  the worst  we stopped doing Radio Row  about  I don't know  at least  I don't know  12 years ago  easy  it's really horrible  me and Ann  first started doing radio together 
[02:19:30]  we had to do a few Radio Rows  I remember we were supposed to do one  and then we got kicked off the air  we were supposed to do one in Boston  for Jim Cook  and I was so excited  because Gene Simmons was going to be there  but then we never wound up going on  because we got booted off  you know what  that was the last time we did Radio Row  we did the Sam Adams Brewery  oh yeah  so here's the problem  with a whole bunch of other radio guys  the thing is  is like you see Gene Simmons  with everybody  before he gets to him  and by the time he gets here  you just feel like shit  yeah  what else does he have for us  and then there's a lot of things  where they promise Gene Simmons 
[02:20:00]  but then you get to talk to a roadie  and like  I don't know what's with Gene  he should be here  right  it's fucking terrible  they said we were going to go to the Super Bowl  this year again  and there's nothing  don't  it's awful  it's fucking  it's the principle though  Ronnie  no no no  have you ever gone to the Super Bowl  as a radio show  yeah  it's fucking awful  yeah but I want to go once  I've never gone  don't do it  I've been at this radio thing  since I was 18  I want to go once  go for real  and fucking just go to the Super Bowl  and SoundCloud it 
[02:20:30]  yeah  I'm going to go and just SoundCloud it  but don't fucking show up  and like  Jim Nance is running late  and there's 800 shows here  to make it feel like  you're just nobody  of course  you know it's like the DMV  of fucking radio  and then you start  interviewing janitors  and like  yeah anybody  kind of old cheerleaders  anyone you can find  I did one at Disney  where they kept running voices  by us  you know  so like  this is the voice  of whoever  what fucking cartoon character  right  and then he would try 
[02:21:00]  to talk that way  and then I would try  to like say  so when did you start  doing voices  and he wouldn't  break character  oh Christ  I'm like  come on  people at home  know you're not  a fucking cartoon  exactly  E-Rock  spatula  hot oil  I gotta think about that  we slap both hands  how about we slap one hand  we slap the one hand  you don't need  did it happen to Mars  every time the same way  or  just once  just once  and that's not abuse  you've had some shit  happen to you  growing up Ronnie  everybody got hit  right  of course  it's our generation  yeah so why would they 
[02:21:30]  now turn around  and call it abuse  if everybody got it  see I don't know  you're the greatest  corny  I don't even know  if you're  fucking with us  I mean  a hot spatula  just because everyone  was a slave  in the 79  doesn't mean  it's no longer slavery  yeah but nobody  knew not to  so you can't break  the balls of the people  at the time  oh look  there's a YouTube videos  of guys getting  hit in the butt  with spatulas  that's a little different  this was heated though  yeah  but his mom was cooking  it's not like she  sat it on a pan  right 
[02:22:00]  let's bring him in  I don't care  I mean  I almost had him crying  but I failed  because I pointed out  that he was almost crying  and that made him  uber aware  here's what  I blew it  here's what you say  instead of crying  you just say  I know I set your eyes  I said that  there's some water  in your eyes  that's what I thought  would work  that should have worked  yeah  okay so I didn't blow  because that's exactly  what I said  well you just be comforting  just be comforting  like you're like  I know it's rough  but it's gonna be alright  and then all of a sudden  they feel relaxed  and then they cry  and then you call them  here comes Mars  and then he tells me 
[02:22:30]  this morning  he goes  bruh  I got so many more stories  I'm like  what were you waiting for  yesterday was the  let's make everyone sad  because Mars had a shitty  live show  hi Mars  hi buddy  how are you guys  how are you feeling today  pretty good  I tried to relate to you  a little bit  when I came in  and you didn't really  want to talk about  yesterday's appearance  I noticed  I didn't know  what to make of it  this morning  talking to you  so I just wanted  to leave it alone  I even held the door  a little longer  than I usually do  thinking you'd follow me in  it was awkward  I know  I didn't know 
[02:23:00]  if I were to say  what's wrong with you  to say thank you  or whatever  but I'm really nervous now  why  because Ronnie's in  because Ronnie's in  and Ronnie fucking  pulls shit out of people  that's not true  yes you do sir  you're the best  just relax  you're like an interrogator  no you're all dressed  in camouflage  like anything happens  you go into the bushes  we can't even see you Mars  and he says you speak  baby Spanish  I do  which I think is hilarious  he's absolutely right  yeah  why don't you speak  the language  if your mom  only speaks Spanish 
[02:23:30]  like I said  it tore up  I speak it tore up  but how do you have  a mom or father  that you can't really  like communicate with  that's strange  to me  my earlier days  yeah I spoke better  and as I grew up  and grew distant from them  I didn't use the language  yeah but you probably  never talked to your mom  on more of a  higher I should say  than a third grade level  yeah  absolutely right  your entire life  absolutely right  that's weird  that's all she's got  is there a lot of  no I'm thinking  that's all you got  as far as Spanish goes  that's all she's got 
[02:24:00]  trust me it's her  it's her she's  wow she  okay  yeah  okay  I got you  all right  so what do you do  pat a mom most of the time  you're pointing at things  some English words  yeah some pointing  you guys must enjoy  a nice episode  of Dora the Explorer  that must be your show  huh  I like Dora  she's cool  if Boris comes home  during Sesame Street  his mom's like  shh  working on apps  right now  so uh  was the spatula 
[02:24:30]  one time  that was just  one time deal  that's why she was  cooking right  no she wasn't cooking  she set it up  she set the heat  that's fucking  that means  that's psychotic  he must have been awful  no I wasn't  no I was not  not deserving  something like that  anyway  I was mischievous  yeah  I was uh  you know  I was an altar boy  well I was one of those  altar boys  and choir boys  that uh  a priest  yeah drinking the wine  eating the fucking  hosts  it's a mortal sin 
[02:25:00]  I mean  seriously  I was hungry  yeah but that's the worst  thing you could do  before they were blessed  you're gonna burn  as soon as they come out  the box  no I was a good altar boy  cause I would do it  as soon as they came out  of the box  as opposed  exactly  how hungry are you  that you're eating  that crap  it's great  no they don't  yes they do  everyone's  no  there's absolutely no taste  they taste like  fucking uncooked bread  no they're not  I like the way it tastes  no it's horrendous  and it just used to  remember how it just  lay in your mouth  and just kind of dissolve  they disappeared  they dissolved  so how does that taste good 
[02:25:30]  it's like a packing peanut  they're disgusting  it's a packing peanut  it's a breath strip  I love it  without the flavor  I loved them  did you have a priest  yes well that's the thing  I was getting at  well no  wow look at him  look at Ronnie  slow it down  Ronnie look at him jumping  no  I didn't even ask the question yet  what I was getting at is  because of the way I was  priests would not  you know  attempt anything  you know  they don't  they like the docile kids  the kids that do  whatever they're told  not motherfuckers like me 
[02:26:00]  ugly  did you know  you wanted it though  no I did not  what  no  oh  no  what  so yeah  but what  but  did you know  that other kids  were getting molested  no not in my school  my entourage  was also a bunch of misfits  you know  so you were a problem child  no  Ronnie's getting the real story  he's one of the Jets  his mama's gonna put up with that  she smacked him with a hot spatula  oh man  this is a different story today 
[02:26:30]  no  you were a problem child  no I was  I was  you know  were you one of those guys  on the screen  you know  you remember back in the day  I don't know if you had this game  in Long Island  but we used to have this game  in Washington Heights  called Scully  Scully  what Scully  and you would take  back in the day  the wooden chairs  they would have  on the legs  metal caps  remember those  I think we still  they still have it  on the bottom  right  we would take the chairs  and pop them off  take the metal cap  take the rubber off  out of them 
[02:27:00]  the metal  we would fill it with crayon  and on the street itself  we were  the game Scully  would be  a bunch of little boxes  very poor  really  you guys never seen this game  what did you do  okay  so it would be  boxes  they were numbered  in different locations  it was 1 through 13  13 being in the middle  in mud  so it was a small square  so you would go  1  2  3  4  and as you're doing it  the guy that's playing with you  you would knock him out of whack 
[02:27:30]  you know  you knock him out of the place  take his place  things like that  guys never play that  no  it sounds great  it was fun  it was fucking fun  so we would  I would do things like that  I would steal the caps  from the chairs  you couldn't find like  just bottle caps  it seemed like it would have  worked with bottle caps  why are you fucking up  with milk caps  the milk caps  alright so get some milk caps  the metal caps were better  because if I hit you  with a metal cap  and you had a plastic shit  I would send your shit away  like boom  gone  man you grew up  in the early 50s 
[02:28:00]  damn  this is like  we did something similar  our parents used to buy us toys  yeah exactly  we played with them  yeah we  they would take us to  Toys R Us  with a gift card  but that type of stealing  I would do  you know  fights  I would get into fights  so you deserved  what your mom gave you  I mean you gave her  a rough time  you know what I mean  you were hard on that woman  no it was not hard on that woman  I guess  I guess like  we spoke yesterday  I reminded her of  her husband  wait you spoke to her yesterday  no he's saying  as he said  oh okay 
[02:28:30]  I thought there was  a little conversation  after your appearance  your dad used to steal  the caps on chairs too  that's mean  that's seriously mean  I don't understand  why you're fucking up  good chairs  that's so weird  yeah so  shit like that  so that's all I would do  did you hear that  but you look like  your dad  so she hated you for it  yeah I think that  these guys hit the nail  on the head  I look a lot like him  I also have an attitude  like him  so  yeah  she did it  to get out on you  did you hear the story  where he came home  from school  and his mom was waiting 
[02:29:00]  for him  and said  we're fighting today  she actually put her  hands up man  and they squared off  but it's weird  with him  like  he stayed  he does martial arts  oh yeah  every night  he's just thinking  I have to defend myself  I can't be humiliated  of course  you know  I've got to be able  to stand up  I'm not  you know  you're trying to protect  that kid inside you  yeah when was the last time  you got  someone got the best of you  yesterday  about 4 o'clock  what  you said the best of me  right  yeah I was training  yesterday with 
[02:29:30]  someone  no I don't mean that  because you're  in a whole different world  than the average person  I mean just  when did someone  take your scully caps  yeah  when was the last time  someone took  the last time  I had a good fist fight  was at 21  and since then  no one has really  been able to fuck with you  every day you're ready  that's what I mean  unfortunately  you know you train  and you think  that it's coming  and it never comes  not that I want it to come  oh you want it to come  you want it to come  you want a good excuse  you want to be attacked  one day by an older  Puerto Rican  with a spatula 
[02:30:00]  in her head  fuck her up  she's just coming out  of Sonoma  with a stupid spatula  I feel bad for her  but you know  a lot of people  bring up the abuse thing  yeah  our whole generation  got hit  did you ever feel  like you were abused  or any of your friends  were abused  not really  no we got the wooden spoons  and the sticks  yet we had to go outside  and get our own stick  every once in a while 
[02:30:30]  see that would be abuse  they would come  and arrest those people  today  yeah  I came in with a small stick  and then they would laugh  and I would diffuse  the situation a little bit  see Ronnie  honestly  I had no idea  that that was abuse  all these years  I'm fucking 47 man  and as I'm talking  to the guys yesterday  and looking at their eyes  and their reactions  right  it was the first time  I really you know  no you know  I spoke about it before  plenty of times  I'm good with it  but seeing these guys reaction  I was like holy shit  you didn't know 
[02:31:00]  that you were such a victim  yeah  I thought that's the way it was  what gave it away  was it the tents in our pants  I think you knew  maybe  and maybe  that shit was buried  until yesterday  regressed it  but I mean the other part of it  is you know that you weren't loved  that's the thing  oh yeah  you know that everyone else  see that's the shit man  she did a lot of other fucking shit  that showed love  like you know  being able to put me through  parochial school  you know  all these years  that's obligation  that's not love  that's  that's obligation  well she would do something 
[02:31:30]  and remember this  I didn't bring this up  what are you through  just regular school  like the other kids  what are you talking about  what do you mean  Catholic school  yeah but parents are just  supposed to do that  well they could send me  to public school  well you probably would have  been better off  less molested  no no no no  I think Catholic school  did a lot for me bro  alright  gave you a little discipline  yeah  taught you to be quiet  didn't steal anymore  it taught me how to  what happened to my fucking head  you're the guy  I'd not be distracted  exactly  we can't call anyone  you're the guy 
[02:32:00]  you better figure it out  taught you to take your medicine  it's amazing that somebody  who committed mortal sins  of drinking the blood of Christ  as if it was a cocktail  and I was like  oh thank God for Catholic school  you really helped me so much  I had a priest  that used to say  god damn  he used to curse  yeah  he used to curse  it was fun  aren't those the hip guys  the what guys  the hip guys  I like priests like that  yeah he was cool  yeah  he was cool  you said you had other stories  yeah  it was a world without love 
[02:32:30]  it took me  wait it took me  nine years  to put this shit on air  slow it down  you were the one  excitedly telling me  this morning  I got other stories  I've seen some shit man  give us one  a good story  in reference to  my mother  I remember  see like  gay people in my family  and all that shit  that was  that was a common thing  like it was not a big deal  for example  we would go visit  Titi 
[02:33:00]  and Titi had  Wonder Woman over there  Wonder Woman was a nickname  of one of the individuals  that used to hang out with her  and it was  Tranny  yeah  so we were used to that  kind of stuff  you know  we grew up with that  Wonder Woman  yeah  his name was Wonder Woman  he used to spin around  like Wonder Woman  his dick was just turning  like fucking helicopter cock  I remember this shit  as a kid  for sure  he was the king  of the meatspan  covered in jizz  right  it's like  oh Wonder Woman  what a fun game  he put his cock 
[02:33:30]  in an invisible condom  and violate you  Wonder Woman  yeah  who was hanging out  with Wonder Woman  they didn't show that  Wonder Woman would come around  by herself  or by itself  was she related to yourself  by herself  was she related  or he  I don't know  family friend  family friend  but then  how was she associated  with your family  I don't know  it was my aunt  I used to go visit her  in the Bronx  and he used to be there  hanging out  I guess  they used to smoke weed  do something together  I don't know  PC pig  gay people that have 
[02:34:00]  good connections with drugs  so what happened  did Wonder Woman  fumble with you  no no  that was just  like growing up  I was used to  seeing shit like that  it was in  when I see a tranny  or hear tranny sex  it's no big deal  what kind of sex  did you see  not see  but I heard  I heard a lot of  you heard sex  well  you know  I used to go  I used to go visit  my aunt right  with  in the Bronx  I used to go into  the rooms in the mornings  and she also had  that fucking piss pot  oh you heard about 
[02:34:30]  the piss pot right  yeah  nasty  was your aunt  the sister of your mother  yes  see  there was something  going on with that  father at night  I bet you that they  didn't like to leave  the bedroom at night  because why would  both of them  get into this habit  of pissing in this  fucking thing  without  one I could see  being a lazy  you know what  but I mean  I don't understand  why too  hold on  hold on  for the people  that weren't  listening yesterday  your mom  would piss  into some kind  of bedpan thing  instead of getting up  and going 20 feet  to the bathroom  in the middle of the night  and now we're learning  the sister did the same thing 
[02:35:00]  right  now I know  who has Wonder Woman  as a friend  right  and there was three  did Wonder Woman  live with her  no no  Wonder Woman  just visit  alright  you know  and I know  of three aunts  that do that  the piss pot  all same  wait three aunts  and your mom  so that would be four  no three all together  it's my mom  and two aunts  so there's three  girls all together  do the piss pot thing  what the fuck  is that about Ronnie  I don't know  probably they grew up  in some fucking  dirt shack  down in Puerto Rico  with no bathroom  and they were 
[02:35:30]  probably had an outhouse  yeah  maybe instead of  going outside  to an outhouse  where the wild dogs are  oh you know what  there you go  but why wouldn't  you go fuck that  I got a nice bathroom now  that's a bunch of bullshit  because it was an apartment  in Puerto Rico  you're telling Ronnie  that's a bunch of bullshit  no I'm just letting  I'm saying like  if that would be  an excuse for my mother  it's a bunch of bullshit  because they had an apartment  where in Puerto Rico  yeah they didn't have  an outhouse  they lived on the  second or third floor  and there was  bathroom on the  first floor  on the same floor  you know 
[02:36:00]  in the apartment  but probably all  clogged up  with fucking shit  maybe you're onto  something there Jimmy  that they were afraid  to go to the bathroom  maybe they'd sneak out  and when they went  out to the kitchen  or whatever  in the bathroom  you'd be fucking  drunk in the living room  come here  come here  yeah I was drunk  all the time  yeah he was  he was  Afro-Cuban  he came from  why didn't bother  with the Cuban  we got it  he came  no because actually  I'm Puerto Rican  Afro-Cuban  yeah right  yeah he came over  to Puerto Rico  and he started 
[02:36:30]  a big family  he was 10 kids  he was the barber  of the town  everybody knew him  but he was also  he was with your aunt  and your mom  yeah  he was with them both  he was like the fucking  cock of the walk there  anybody that was in that  house was gonna get banged  oh yeah  well I don't know about banged  but they would get  she would tell me stories  that he used to  abuse  hit them with the strap  the strap to  their father  sharpen your razor  yeah  yeah so  getting hit with that  was pretty rough too  so I guess an extension cord  to her 
[02:37:00]  because I keep bringing  that shit up  because that  when I felt that extension cord  I remember to this day  I couldn't breathe  with the pain so much  yeah that's rough  yeah  dude let me  an extension cord is rough  and I understand  a wooden spoon  or that other shit  but that's abuse  no  even for that generation  look at Ronnie  see  he's not fazed  he's not fazed  I just feel like  you can  you know  you're judging  outside of the era  that it took place in  you know  that back then  extension cord though  it's the same as a belt 
[02:37:30]  that's a whip  same as a belt  no  isn't it the same as a belt  dude it's two different things  I would love to get hit by a belt  as opposed to being a belt  sure  alright well  I think I got a belt  you said you're fucking  so high there  I'd love to get hit by a belt  Iraq would you get hit  by a belt  and an extension cord  so we can see if it's different  oh I don't want  you haven't done anything  for the show lately  can I tell you something  Troy is texting  yeah  saying Iraq is a pussy  and he will get hit  with a hot spatula  no he shouldn't do that shit  Troy is the fucking 
[02:38:00]  real deal man  where's Troy  is he here yet  he's here  let's bring Troy in  and let's get the hot plate  before fucking  Radio Wizard shuts us down  do you like being spanked  by girls or no  no hell no  I don't like that shit  any rough stuff  tying me down  fuck no  I don't like it  oh yeah  I'm losing my mind bro  here's Troy Kwan  yeah I'll do it  Iraq's a pussy  it's a hot spatula  in oil  and then we take it  out of the fucking  hot oil  and whack your hands  just smack me on my hand 
[02:38:30]  yeah  that's easy right  yeah  did your mom just  let it sit there  Morris how did it go down  that shit was hot  it was you know  and the grease  did she just hit it  yeah she just hit it  but the grease is important  because the grease  is what stayed on his hand  and burned  you dip it in grease  alright we got a hot plate  around this joint or what  some grease  we got some grease  grease  that's easy to get  do you think  an extension cord  is worse than a belt  if you got hit by that  well a belt  has a bigger surface 
[02:39:00]  that's what I'm thinking  but a cord might have  more of a whip  type of an effect on it  there's no doubt  that the cord  an extension cord  is a motherfucker  there's metal running  through the extension cord  did you get hit  with the end of it  or is it just like  they hold it  like a belt would  just like a belt  oh that's a motherfucker  it's gonna come down  faster too  did it leave a mark  did it leave the big  long line across  I left a big long line  did you show it to your  friends later  did you have any scars  I showed you yesterday  the only scar I could  come up with  I didn't say any scars  what did you show me  I don't remember  it's inside  his scars are inside  deep inside 
[02:39:30]  my hair is on my hand  oh right right  they don't grow  he can't grow  so yeah  did you ever  we shouldn't  hey do you ever  bring it up to your mom  now  uh no  I have in the past  and they act like  uh you know  oh well that was Dan  I was stupid  I was ignorant  you know so it's kind of  oh there's a low acknowledgement  what are you gonna do  sometimes there's no acknowledgement  yeah but they  I mean no  what would you like her to say  nothing  but I'm saying  if you talked about  how would you like her to react  what would be  what would be a reaction 
[02:40:00]  where you went  okay she kind of gets it  to stop being a fucking cunt now  and just you know  be there for the  I don't want her around  nothing  I want nothing  good for you  I really don't  yeah stop with that shit  stop with that  wishing that she's gonna change  she's not  the reality is  no one ever changes  no  no one ever changes  they don't  but then it's  it's up to you  whether you accept that  exactly  that's the fucking thing  that I don't understand  like people are like  oh I hit my parents  I'm going over there  this weekend  yeah  why would you  why would you go 
[02:40:30]  to an unpleasant place  you don't put up with it  with anyone else  no  the only  the only reason  like I said yesterday  I put up with it now  is cause I have a lovely wife  that wants to have  all the grandparents  she wants the perfect family  that didn't happen  that isn't a lie  she's getting  she's getting  yesterday I told her  about what happened here  and she was like  dude  really man  if you feel that way  we don't have to  have a run  too late  you know  it's not too late  it took this show  for her to realize  right  she's a nice person  seriously  the thing is  is like  Opie went across 
[02:41:00]  for you  the way your wife  should have  that's the thing  you gotta let  into your head  every fucking night  when you're laying  next to her  you know what I mean  like she's asking you  swallow some shit  so we can feel like  we're a real family  instead of the truth  you got a real family  it's not  you know  it's a real radio family  that's what I tell you  it's a real radio family  this is your family  that's what I say  but you got a real family  don't worry about  making  your familia  it seems like  you're a grounded father  and you got a good woman  and you got good kids  that's all you need  you don't  because if you bring her around 
[02:41:30]  then there's gonna be  that darkness  and that  everyone's tense  you don't need that shit  and your kids pick up on that  and granted  you know  she's getting older  trying to get to the pearly gates  so she's fucking  you know  but she's trying to do the right thing  like when she does have my kids  what do you mean she's doing the right thing  has she removed all spatulas from our house  stop pissing in front of the kids  how about we start there  how about we get rid of the bedpan  and the spatulas  has she stopped tankling into a chock full of nuts can  right  and how about she puts down her fist 
[02:42:00]  start there  and get rid of that old fucking stereo system  seems to be a fucking hazard in her house  da da da da da da  fucking parrots flying around  lizards on the wall  someone throws a quarter off the fucking cruise ship  the whole family's diving in  as fast as they can  I'm glad we were able to make the jokes today  because yesterday was a little intense  we got some jokes in but  did you hear his head got  kind of got stuck in the old stereo  you remember  I was describing that big stereo 
[02:42:30]  back in the 70s  two big speakers on either end  there was in the middle  a turntable radio  and then next to that big television  so that big whole stereo system  when she knocked me down  you know  I'm young  I don't know  I go in  when my head turned to the side  and she's mounting me  so I look at her  so now I turn my head upright  and I wedge my head  underneath the stereo system  not knowing that I could turn it back  the other way  I'm fucking nervous  this bitch is trying to kill me  you know  and she's looking at me  and then she's actually 
[02:43:00]  Sam asked like  how was she hitting me  she was punching me in the face  and smiling  and going  and like  with every hit  was like  huh  like huh  how about that  she hated your father  she's just bullying you  you might want to listen  to Pearl Jam's Alive  it's a whole song  about that shit  listen to that whole  don't call me daughter bullshit  that shit  you're like  Pearl Jam's all about  family abuse  you might want to  go into their catalog  a little bit  I like Pearl Jam  go listen to Alive  imagine  you should wear shorts  wherever you go now  like that 
[02:43:30]  Troy you ever get hit  is this no big deal to you  I got hit as a kid  I mean nothing like that  oh so you acknowledge  that Mars had a rough huh  oh yeah  yeah he had a bad  but it's like  I guess it's like  a Hispanic thing  I mean they just  they're just racist  they're crazy  yeah that's horrible  yeah she threw  I know we all  maybe not Sam  maybe you  maybe she threw  something at you  your parents maybe  exactly  nah my mom was about  throwing my whole room  out on the driveway  but thank god  she didn't throw anything 
[02:44:00]  did that mean  you had to leave  like you're supposed  to leave now  no I was supposed  to clean my room  oh great  yeah  did it work  if I left shoes out  it would be the  dumbest stupidest thing  so instead of saying  hey why don't you  put your shoes in the closet  no the whole room  had to be in the  on the driveway  yeah  why do they care  about your room  I never understood that  because if the doors close  who cares  but she  back in the day  in the 70s  she threw a  hairbrush at me  and the plastic  back then  was not like the plastic  we have now 
[02:44:30]  a little lightweight  plastic back then  was fucking sturdy  you know  plastic today  will do some damage  okay  the bitch throws it  she misses me  you know  back then  we didn't have sheetrock  we had plaster  she made a fucking hole  you see the plaster  coming off  you know  I didn't think  anything of it  I thought  hey she missed  you know  but now  as I'm speaking  to you guys  I'm like  you know  if she would have  hit me with that shit  she would have  fucking probably  really caused  some serious damage  you think she hated you  most  yeah I think so  that's the part that hurts  I still think 
[02:45:00]  she hates me  she does  she has a problem with me  do you get any love  from the older people  in your family  like an aunt  an uncle  those people  yeah yeah yeah  crazy love  I had a grandma  that was amazing  you know  I have an uncle  that gives me so much love  that I think  that he knows  the things that have occurred  you know  so that's kind of cool  but why wasn't he there  to fucking save you  that's the thing  because it's in his house  yeah but the thing is  if he could  you know what I mean  like today  if you found out  some neighbor kid  was getting abused  you'd go over  where were these people  for you  that's the part that hurts 
[02:45:30]  despite all the  the nice things  that are being said  that's why  that's that thing inside you  you'll never be able  to take care of  yeah they thought  it was the thing  to do back then  I guess you know  I really  I'm good with it  you're not good  yes I am  yes I am  you're fizzing  in your pockets  you're not good  you know what I mean  it's okay  this is a fucking safe place  I passed  try to keep your hands  still for a minute  they won't believe  that you're good with it  you're good with it  the way Ving Rhames  was good with it  when Bruce Willis  came back in  is this Armageddon 
[02:46:00]  I don't know  we're in a couple films together  no this was the ass fuck  sheriff  and Mars is asking  for music  for a segment  you want your segment produced  no no  how about the Hulk music  why don't you play some music  you rock instead  just sitting in there  fucking gaining weight  no disrespect  I guess we're not doing  the spatula thing  what happened to this show  I don't know  we would have had a fucking  hot plate fired up by now  nobody takes you seriously  at your word  no no  that's not it's lawyers  we're looking out for  they're not up yet 
[02:46:30]  no yeah  lawyers are just sleeping  give the fuck  first hour  is the wild wild west  first hour  we do whatever the fuck  right  they're still sleeping  you got 15 minutes to burn  watch bladder run down  why not  I'm just tired of people  not stepping up around here  right  you know what I mean  Troy comes to fucking  comes to work  Troy put a strawberry  up his ass  what's that noise  what is that  it's your phone or something  oh  Mars vibrate  what's going on  that's a water sound  your phone  oh man are you trying  to keep calm 
[02:47:00]  yeah right  even the phone sets them off  yes  it's sad  what was that  it's what a relevant  calls  it's the sound of just  the fucking  over the water  was that a wave  you hear the sea  and then you hear  the ship off shore  go  yeah you want to leave  is that  no it reminds  of this whole family  holding onto a door  who's calling you  it was  one of the guys  in the shop  don't they know  you're busy  you're being a big  radio star right now 
[02:47:30]  that shit could wait  what do they need you  to do that  what do they want  I don't know  they're looking for  some nuts and bolts  or something  probably  there you go  see Sirius is calling  me now  let it go  I'm busy  alright listen  so Troy's tired  let's step it up  Troy stuck a chocolate  covered strawberry  up his ass  and Sal grabbed it  without his hands  that's the type of  program we're giving  people these days  well you bring it  back the shock jock  thing which I really  appreciate  we're trying to  bring back the shock jock  it's retro now  try to have some fun  around here  I know you want to  do it in the studio  but that probably 
[02:48:00]  leaves a mark  and will probably  have legal issues  why are you saying that  no because Troy's  not going to sue  Troy doesn't sue  he doesn't give a shit  I like the other one  better remember when  I told you when she  smacked me in the  bitter cold  that's a good one  that's a rough one  that's a rough one man  being slapped in the  face in the cold  stinks  so what  we have to hang  outside in the cold  for a while  it's not cold out  today  can our hands cold  it's like 40 today  I think  it is  and who would  slap Troy  it's nice out there  way to not bring 
[02:48:30]  this up  the last three days  when we were  freezing our asses off  he waits till it's  blimey in New York  what are we going to do  where's that hot plate  where's the grease  do we even have one  I don't even know  you have to go buy one  maybe we can microwave  some fucking oil  or something  pour it on your head  Martha Stewart's studio  but your mother made  you a better parent  right Mars  I'm sorry  your mom made you  a better parent  because you'll never  do shit like that  you'll never even  probably hit your kids  yeah absolutely  well that's an  interesting question  Jim Norton 
[02:49:00]  because then he might  be going too far  the other way  oh let the kids  get away  now  now you're talking  that's sort of  what I was talking  to Jimmy about  on the way home  when you are brought  up in a household  that's a little strange  you could go  you could do  the exact same shit  or you could go  the complete opposite  way where they're  just wild kids  no they're not wild  but they'll walk  over daddy  they will right  they'll get over  see nobody  respected you  nah  generation before  generation beneath  no they  they understand  the respect  they do respect me  but you know 
[02:49:30]  they'll get  they'll get  you know  you do the timeouts  that shit don't work  but I have to do  my kid mocks me  and he goes  over here  like he'll point  to places  where he's supposed  to sit  I'm like  are you kidding  you know what  when we didn't  behave  you know what  works  and then he sits  there mocking us  yeah sure  of course  why wouldn't he  so then we'd like  take his chair  and we'd try to  put it in like  maybe a boring room  that's the best  we can do  does he have  electronics  what do you want  leapfrogs and  things like that  what do you want  to electrocute  my kid  yeah exactly  get him in a tub  with that stuff  you know 
[02:50:00]  leap pads  you know  leap pads  what kind of sick  fucking thought  you got now  look it up man  I know leapfrog  what are you getting at  Tetris  you take that away  Tetris  you take that away  from them  I know my son  he's seven man  all I have to do  is talk about  I'm removing your  DS  yeah but what about  these people  in the fucking  like you ever see  these little kids  in a restaurant  where they're just  screaming  fuck it up  and their parents  are like this  Wallace  Wallace  Wallace  it doesn't happen to me  I'm like  I've actually sat  in restaurants  I go like this  hey Wallace 
[02:50:30]  I'm not fucking around  with you  sit the fuck down  because I'm not  your parents  because I can't  I don't understand  why people let themselves  get abused like this  you're not an equal  with those things  okay you know what works  absolutely works  when my kid acts up  I'm mortified  I get him out of the situation  I get so uncomfortable  that I'm bothering other people  but if your tonality changes  the kid has got to respect that  the kid has got to say  my old man's kind of crazy  that's it right there  that's exactly what I do  I could use like more of a stern voice 
[02:51:00]  and he'll calm down  I've realized that so far  dude you grab him by the bicep  put a little squeeze  and look at him in the eyes  he's got thumbprint bruises 
[02:51:30]  all over his arms  that's what they do  that's the Puerto Rican way  what do you do really  you just squeeze his arm a little bit  it's all in there Mars  15 years  Mars Jr. is going to be  on a radio show  telling stories  and you're going to be like  I didn't know  I don't understand  why are you so upset about it  he's dressed in camouflage  now all I have to do  is change my tone  and the eyes  and that's it  it's good enough  oh boy  how old are these kids  I'm sorry 
[02:52:00]  how old are they  5, 7, and 15  what gangs are they running with  no gangs  I'm on top of them boy  I'm on top of them  just like your mom was on top of you  giving a left hook  no  oh boy  it's gross  everyone's looking down now  hey you got the Puerto Rican flag there  I don't know why it's on this either  but the alley  float like a butterfly sweatshirt  that Jimmy's wearing  I don't know  it makes no sense  Puerto Rican flag  I have no  my ex saw it  and she goes  that's a hipster sweatshirt  I'm like really  she goes yeah  it's got a Puerto Rican flag 
[02:52:30]  I'm like I didn't even notice it  it makes no sense though  maybe it was when he fought  did alley ever fight down there  in Puerto Rico  I'm sure he did  I don't think so either  I don't think so  he might have trained at one point  but I don't think  that he ever had a  did he have some Puerto Rican blood  in him maybe  a little bit  that's probably one of those sweatshirts  they sent to Africa  you know they couldn't sell here  but you got it  no I bought it at a very hip place  like where  ooh  I think it was Urban Outfitters  I was cold  really  wow that's weird  so you abuse your kids 
[02:53:00]  no I do not abuse my kids  why are you squeezing their arms  get on top of them a little bit  no I don't get on top of them  I'm your words  look how nervous he gets  this is great  oh  you alright  it's unchattered waters for me  unchattered waters  nobody's talking about them  exactly  this is what you say  it takes a lot of bravery  to let this stuff out  I want to unshatter your teeth  to begin with  it takes a lot of bravery  for you just to  express this  it took  like I said 
[02:53:30]  it took nine years  to even bring it up  and you're kind of like  an alpha male too  so this is kind of cool  to see an alpha male  break down a little bit  that's why  he's an alpha male  he needs to protect  he can't let it happen again  and that's why  he's always thinking  every day he's thinking  when is something bad  going to happen  now do you grow up  do you think that way  like oh  something bad  going to happen  I think most people do that  only from six to ten  yeah sure  anything could  I laugh at most of the stuff  that happens around me  because of how I was brought up  I think  you just laugh it off 
[02:54:00]  like  yeah I've seen a lot of shit  dumb shit  you know  mine was more like  mental abuse  a lot of screaming and yelling  and rude shit  that's rough too  what was weird about it though  coming home and seeing  your room in the driveway  it's a little rough  right  why didn't you act like  oh this is my room now  you have to read the comic book  under your lamp  mom this is great  thanks  my thing was  I realized from an early age 
[02:54:30]  so I like avoided the house  as much as I could  I became a caddy  at 12  13  and I would  I would do two loops a day  easy  so I was there  when the sun rose  and I was there  as the sun was setting  you do two bags  two bags  now I got the herniated disc  to prove it  yeah that was a lot of weight  for a 13 year old  what kind of fucking man  let a little kid  carry two fucking bags  it was disgusting  how did you feel better  about yourself  if you're a man  like kid grab both those bags  and struggle with them  yeah and follow me 
[02:55:00]  I was half the sizes  of a lot of these golfers  at first  yeah  it was crazy  but I enjoyed it  I enjoyed the conversation  just being out of the house  and being on the course  love the sport  you know  that was my thing  to avoid  I had siblings  that confronted  I'm like  that was just stupid  and then I knew  at 18  let's go  let's do this  yeah  so  but in the back  of your mind  you're like  there was never  any comforting time  for you either  I mean  we talk about it 
[02:55:30]  I mean  if two days went by  without some kind  of drama in my house  that was huge  two  two days  barely  and that barely happened  there was always  some dumb issue  it was always  dumb shit  you know  she didn't raise  kids that were bad  you know  she had  seven kids in the house  and none of us  have any real  like  issues or problems  you know what I mean  that deserved anything  that was going down  it was always  dumb shit  like if we didn't eat  our meal  that would be a problem  if we didn't eat  everything on our plate 
[02:56:00]  why do you think  people get into  that thing  because they  like  it's like  they didn't plan  their life  and then they  look around  and there's  all these kids  and they're like  what happened  that's a really good  question  in my situation  my mom has openly  said this  which is kind of  fucked up  that she never  wanted all those kids  she had  she had six births  and then she had  my dad's  you know  daughter from another  marriage  so seven kids  in the house  she was raised  catholic  so she did it  the catholic way 
[02:56:30]  where you don't use  birth control  and you have kids  she never wanted  seven kids  she tells us this  wouldn't a mentally  ill person have problems  even if there's only two  though  like the fact is  that they're crazy  so no matter what  the circumstances  they're gonna be  fucked up  I think so  but I think  certainly having  a lot of kids  helped it along  a little bit too  you know  but yeah  she came from  a weird house  which I don't know  much about  because I don't  ask the questions  her mom was  a cunt  I will tell you  that much  my mom wasn't  as bad as  her mom  you know  her mom  sued her 
[02:57:00]  for money  that she borrowed  when you know  we had the six kids  and now we gotta  eat and pay the bills  so my mom  took out a little  loan with her own  mother  and they weren't  paying her back  fast enough  and I remember  that my quote  I say quote  because she wasn't  my grandma  ended up suing my mom  and went through  the whole court system  everything  lawyers and all sorts  of shit  fucked up  right  and it was  you know  they were in a bad  spot  they needed the money  and my dad  wasn't making  that much money 
[02:57:30]  at the time  and they were  paying her back  but not good  enough for her  and she didn't  even need the  fucking money  and sued her own  mom  so my mom  my mom actually  did the right thing  she got rid  of her own mom  early on in my life  said you know  this is a horrendous  influence for my family  so she can't be around  so I went from like  I don't even know  I think I was 12 maybe  and then the next time  I saw her  I was like 22  23 when she was  dying in the hospital  the classic story  I tell on the air  where she looked at me  and went oh precious  you got so you know 
[02:58:00]  big and I just looked  at my mom and said  I'll be in the car  do what you gotta do  I gave her nothing  I was like whatever  old lady  enjoy wherever the fuck  you're going  and that was it  so  but she you know  she removed her  from her own life  to protect our kids  but then you know  my mom did her own shit  see that's the thing  that brings it back  what is the fucking  hardcore thing  is it mental abuse  or is it physical abuse  you know because  we didn't really get  the physical stuff  right  so who had it worse 
[02:58:30]  I had them both  I don't know if I've ever  said this on the air  but my  my  my step sister  she's my sister  but for the sake  of the argument  she got some of the shit  the physical shit  from your mom  yeah and I always wonder  why we weren't getting that  wow that's fucked up  yeah weird shit  yeah like oatmeal  over the head  crap  like fucking mommy  deer shit  oh yeah  or like way more  physical shit with her  and I was like  wow  are we  is that coming our way  and it never really did  not to that extent 
[02:59:00]  but you can't have  physical without mental  you can have mental  without physical  but you can't have  physical without  some kind of mental  aspect  because you're  always afraid  right absolutely  like if you're  walking in the house  your mother's a  fucking wacko  he's got the same  thing and he's also  worried that she's  gonna punch him  in the face  it's like the same  person but you had  seven kids to kind  of spread it over  a little bit  yeah and I always  had the feeling  that my mom  this came out of  therapy which  pumped down my  therapist but I  always had the  feeling that my mom  could kill me  which you know  made it tough to  sleep at night  honestly think that 
[02:59:30]  you might die  oh yeah  yeah yeah yeah  yeah yeah if the  circumstances were  right absolutely  absolutely absolutely  yeah because she  she would just fly  off the handle and  just do crazy shit  but I don't really  remember physical  abuse I just don't  then I wonder why  you were so afraid  that she would kill  you like her mental  abuse was just so  fucking just a lot  of screaming and  yelling all the time  and just like losing  her shit throwing  stuff like hiding in  the attic that type 
[03:00:00]  of thing in the attic  oh yeah I found her  in the attic a couple  times just having  like mental breakdowns  she had mental  breakdowns a lot and  then would have to  go away for that so  yeah and that was  must have been nice  right when she went  away it was like  oh look I'm looking  to see if she's  calling in uh yeah  it was kind of nice  it was like a little  vacation and that's  what it was that's  how it was told to us  too you know oh  she's uh visiting a  relative she'd be gone  for a little while and  she did the shock  treatment back in the  day wow when she  did the shock treatment  when she was  pregnant with my  sister what 
[03:00:30]  old school shock  treatment because  now supposedly they  figure that shit out  a little better  American horror shit  huh American horror  shit I don't know  that's why one flew  over the cuckoo's nest  as as brilliant as  that movie is as a  little you know  that's a little creepy  for me just saying  the yeah the crazies  because in the back  of your mind you're  like does it go down  another generation do  I have this somewhere  oh yeah fuck yeah  is inside my kids  completely yeah  completely aware  you know my my wife  helped me with that  and then I you know  I've been in and out 
[03:01:00]  of therapy making  sure you know  figuring this shit  out how'd your wife  help you she just  uh how did she help  me that's a great  question just uh just  being there for me and  talking about the shit  like she she would  acknowledge the  craziness going around  like this is pretty  fucking crazy right and  then we just you know  we'd start talking and  stuff especially when  she comes from kind of  a happy blue collar  family you know I mean  she would probably tell  you know she had her  own issues growing up  but I I kind of laugh  at it right because of 
[03:01:30]  the you know but that's  not fair but you know  where I how I grew up  and how she grew up I  think is uh you know  see that's what I mean  like but she would  probably argue that  point I think everyone  would argue that point  like well fuck we had a  bed too and this is what  happened to us right  yeah I think there's a  difference like I said  our you know in my  whole neighborhood  everybody got whacked  but we took it because  it wasn't a big deal  right there wasn't any  fear it's like I got to  be home by five we're  still playing ball I'll  go home late and take  a fucking smack on my  way in and that'll be  it right now and I  my thing was always 
[03:02:00]  just go down just hit  the floor whatever  happens I did that  with my parents I did  it with cops when a  cop would start to  fucking hit when we  were kids go right  down my old man used  to call me the bad  actor because if he  gave me a smack I'd  go over the fucking  table I would come up  it was very wrestling  mover I was just  kind of acting like I  was shaking it off and  then go back down  that's funny right  and the same thing if  the cops start to  fucking swing at  people just don't 
[03:02:30]  fucking just go down  yeah and then they're  like oh shit fuck  what did I do hurt  that kid hey Ronnie  you ever had your  mom come on and get  you and start smacking  the shit out of you  outside in the in the  fucking street yeah and  then pull your ass in  and slapping you and  you go in front of  your friends yeah so  she humiliated you in  front of the whole  neighborhood but it  was we were accustomed  to it because that  seems more normal yeah  I've heard a lot of  those type of stories  oh Mars got in  trouble no big deal  you know and then  you know Willie might  get in trouble tomorrow  we all  put your penis 
[03:03:00]  Willie  I understand what did  he do  yeah  Mars talked about him  in third person  that's funny  Willie got me in  trouble again  yeah  I'm trying to explain  my situation a little  bit to Ronnie here I  don't know if I'm  fully explaining it  hey there was like a  there was always like a  sadness there was always  like a black cloud there  was there was always an  issue over just dumb 
[03:03:30]  stuff no one no one  really acted up you  know just normal acting  up in our family but it  was always just an  extremely big deal you  know if he came home a  little drunk or  something at 17 18  normal shit like that  would just be just  horrendous a lot of  just yelling and  screaming and my dad you  know you're a great guy  but would just sit there  and just kind of allow  her to run the  household like this you  know everything was a  big fucking deal it's  the only way I could  explain it just dumb  shit that might have  been a quick little you 
[03:04:00]  know two minute thing  like don't do that or  clean your room became  this over-the-top fucking  thing  see the weird thing is  Fez had the same thing  where his dad was  passive right his mom was  aggressive and you saw  how he turned out right  so you've already I mean  every time that he you  know something comes up  it always go back to  well then my mom and I'm  like your mom isn't  fucking here no yeah I'm  just I'm just yeah I'm  just saying that it  doesn't bother me to the 
[03:04:30]  level it used to for many  years now I'm just  bringing up because it's  the discussion today no  but I think the weirdest  thing about it and people  don't normally talk about  this but the thing that  hurts the most is not  being loved that when  you're not loved right when  you're a kid then that  makes you feel like you're  unlovable and then you  spend the rest of your  life you can't accept and  give love all right here's  the weird thing and I  don't know if I've ever  mentioned on the air I was  completely loved by my mom  completely she just had a  weird way of fucking 
[03:05:00]  showing it I'd see that I  have no doubt that my mom  to this day loves this shit  out of me but then my dad  what does love even mean what  the hell is it if it's love  how come it can be so  explosive right a little  while later I mean and  that adds to our fucking  confusion right that's why  we go through life yeah  but I'm not acting the way  we should act yeah that's a  good point you know but I  have no doubt I was loved  right you know she would  she would always try to do  the right thing but she 
[03:05:30]  just had her own issues  that always got in the  fucking way you know but  I mean Christmas was  beyond amazing our  birthday she she fucking  cooked every night a meal  and we all sat down she  really did fucking try  absolutely but then  would just fly off the  handle over the dumbest  shit all the fucking  time and that's the  lesson I learned because  for many years that's what  I did obviously everyone  knows but it's been a few  years now where I don't do  that shit anymore I  realize how stupid that is 
[03:06:00]  and how it actually hurts  you in the end so the  same way would be for you  like if things didn't work  out perfect everyone knows  you can fucking pull a  million fucking clips of me  losing my fucking mind and  and a lot of times I had a  good point to make but  when you're yelling and  screaming and flying off the  handle no one's gonna  listen to you they're gonna  obviously look at you like  you're a fucking idiot you're  an asshole you're a dick  you're a lunatic right so I  purposely purposely try not  to yell that much and it's  been a few years now so you  then become your dad instead 
[03:06:30]  of your mom then you let all  this stuff go on but inside  no I try to like just handle  handle it from a different  angle I'm not giving up on  like my feelings and and  you know things I want to  express but instead of  yelling and screaming it I'm  trying to find another way  well your wife doesn't yell  either though she doesn't  yell at the kid either no  there are times like I'll  raise my voice in my house  and she'll go stop yelling  I'm like wow this is so  not yelling my definition of  yelling is so different you  know yeah it's interesting I'm 
[03:07:00]  sorry yeah it's interesting how  with you therapy works because  you let you let it out you  know and I don't it's cool to  talk about it like a lot of  people when they find a  therapist they're expecting  some fucking magic cure from  the person you're talking to  but really they're there just  to let to really just listen  and let you just you know get  it out I mean there's so many  times when I'm sitting and  talking to therapy I go holy  fuck that's why I do that like I 
[03:07:30]  have the realization she's not  telling me from a stupid  textbook what's going on I  think a good therapist shows up  late like Judd Hirsch and  ordinary people that's what a  therapist does yeah because of  the swimming you call them on a  pay phone you remember  something about Buck and they  show up for you yeah you saved  yourself seriously you had to  but if you're if you go if you  go to a therapist you're the  strong one if you go to a  therapist and think she's gonna  fucking lay out your plan for  you you're you're on you're on  the wrong path their percent  they ask questions that are smart  like they kind of guide you a  little bit right but it's very 
[03:08:00]  it's very subtle if you got a  good one very subtle the how  they guide you with these  little questions and then you  will go with that that thought  or that question for a while  Mars you think you couldn't even  go no I don't think speaking  about it helps not me I'm not  the type I'm not the type to  talk about something that's he  thinks he's not well yeah that's  silly no it's reason being  because everyone's the type to  talk about what the fuck's going  on in their in their lives okay I  can probably talk about it but 
[03:08:30]  I'm saying the end result will  still be the same we didn't do  anything nothing change I went  through the experience no you'll  change you learn to this shit  you're supposed to change you're  not that the problem is a lot of  people Ronnie's you're gonna nod  your head Ronnie knows you know  you get in these situations with  people in your life and and and  you waste so much fucking time  waiting for them to change that's  not gonna happen you're supposed to  change you're supposed to change  how you handle that person but  talking about it I don't know  yeah because you're an alpha male  you talked about it yesterday for  the first time and it was different 
[03:09:00]  you made you feel better it was  maybe it was a relief that that is  possible but I'm talking like with  relatives never change no I know  that she affects you to this day we  saw it yesterday on this show you  had tears in your eyes that was a big  moment did not nobody saw that but  I'm just okay nobody saw that but it's  okay forget about her she'll never  fucking change she'll always be that  person I know that but I'm just  saying speaking about it doesn't  really I don't know it doesn't do  anything for me because I've tried  speaking about it with other people  and just speak about it with your  wife yes and yes in the past but it 
[03:09:30]  doesn't do anything I mean it doesn't  make me feel better it makes me  angrier when I speak what happened  yesterday or here I was getting  fucking angry that's good yeah what's  wrong with that what's so good about  the anger is just a smokescreen Mars  it's about her feeling feeling pain  anger is just safe that's a male it's  easy for us  anger is easy we're in control when  we're angry  Jimmy's right too man and here's the  transition you're at the age now that  it's time for you to start the warrior 
[03:10:00]  has to go in a different place and you  go on you become the wise man you  become the medicine man this is what  happened as we evolve as we age you  don't want to stay in any one thing  that's why nobody likes a guy who's  fucking 38 running around like he's 18  okay so you you've created this warrior  character you wanted to protect  yourself and the people around you now  slowly surely you move on to become  about wisdom and that's what you get  from understanding yourself 
[03:10:30]  you're not holding on to this shit  you at least get knowledge why this  happened and why maybe you do certain  things and then maybe you can help  somebody else who's got a problem  you're like I know what you're talking  about I went through this and this is  how I came out the other side right now  you're just stuck at that early part that  you wouldn't deal with why why did this  happen to me what did I do what did  they do why so you want to find that  out and you can move on I just think I'm  good with it that's fine that's up to 
[03:11:00]  you I think I'm good with it you're 47  you're wearing camouflage Mars you're  fucking not say you're you're still  trying to hide true are you hiding from  your mom you think she's gonna pop up  yes hide behind a bush or something like  a Puerto Rican Clarice Starling  camouflage that says it all you're  still trying maybe she'll hit the bush  instead of you Lord well I want to make  that point again really I mean you know  the people around you that cause all this 
[03:11:30]  strife they're they're never gonna  fucking change you have to fucking change  how you deal with that shit and I didn't  know that for many fucking years trust  me many fucking years as soon as I  learned that lesson it made things a lot  easier  oh yeah yeah it gets worse this is  hilariously bad more of Opie and Anthony's  worse than 2013  coming up  yeah this is Opie and Anthony's worse of 
[03:12:00]  2013  worse than 2013 my name is Iraq  Iraq radio on Twitter if you care to  follow and also follow oh and a show on  Twitter that's the show's official  account and hopefully we're updating it  throughout the vacation there until we  return on January 16th 2014 and this  segment here we welcome Moses gate to  the show I said gate it's plural  actually Moses gates here on the show  he's an urban explorer who goes all  around the world looking at all the  seedy underbellies of many cities and

[03:13:00]  the world's greatest metropolises a  memoir of urban exploration it's on  Amazon Barnes & Noble iBookstore books a  million and indie bound damn that's  like it's gonna be a big book that's  for real I hope so a lot of people are  pre-ordering just because of the videos  we made yeah that was a crazy time and  that was a fun day yeah that was I  finally said it same that I think it was  last week I posted three videos it was  all in one day that we did all that  shit yeah and we were on the ground for 
[03:13:30]  at least two and a half hours yeah  because that's a it was about a three  mile walk and right stopped a little  bit so yeah I think that was like a  four or five hour day I would think  even longer but yeah I was gonna say  five or six hours but I found out that  Moses was coming in and Roland goes hey  man he's more than willing to you know  show you around a little bit I'm like  fuck yeah and the one thing I always  want to see was where mole people was  filmed yeah not mole people the um oh  fuck I forgot the name of it uh dark 
[03:14:00]  days dark days thank you thank you uh  thank you the black and white movie and  it so happens it's relatively close to  where I live and I've walked that area a  ton of times near the water and all  sudden man you know I show Moses goes  all right uh meet me by the statue statue  Eleanor Roosevelt yeah it was all creepy  yeah like I was in in the middle of  some like game of clue or something  meet me at the statue well it's no fun  if you know we just meet at a coffee  shop right right and then I like I  just trusted you because of Roland I 
[03:14:30]  didn't know him and all of a sudden I  meet him at the statue and there's  Moses I'm like all right yeah and then  he doesn't I'm expected flashlights and  all sorts of shit we did have one  flashlight but he didn't check the  battery so we're underground for three  hours in the dark I'm like oh man we  could have used a flashlight oh shit so  you got to read the book because  there's at least three times in the  book where I forget a flashlight so you  that would seem to be number one thing  wouldn't that be the number one thing  that should be one thing is you right  like yourself right second thing the 
[03:15:00]  flashlight so you can see in a way it  was cool that we didn't have a  flashlight because a lot of times we  were walking and it was pitch dark and  remember the one moment I almost fell  into a fucking hole yeah you got to  watch for that there's holes like big  fucking holes down there and there just  happened to be light in this area we  were walking just chatting you know  bullshit and all some like holy fuck we  almost walked into this pretty  impressive hole there was one time  this is a long time ago I was in an  old abandoned courthouse and I just fell  backwards down a hole just like really 
[03:15:30]  saying yeah wow about like seven or eight  feet I got up hurt to breathe got on the  number two train check myself into Harlem  general right waited a couple hours in the  in the emergency room and you know I  ended up okay but you always got to pay  attention that's the point right holy  where was that courthouse on a 163rd and  Boston Road up in the Bronx is it still  something you could like check out I  don't think so because they're  redeveloping it I mean it's this 
[03:16:00]  beautiful beautiful old courthouse and  it was abandoned I want to say since the  1970s but I'm not sure and they've been  re they've been redoing it they've been  rehabilitating it I think that it's going to  be a community center I'm not a hundred  percent sure but that whole area has been  built up a lot what'd you get to see in  there before you fell backwards I just  like have you been to any of the  downtown courthouses or any you know  just an old courthouse downtown there's  been in an active one yeah we've been  exactly a few active ones over the years  a man imagine that and there's a there's 
[03:16:30]  a real cool statue up on top also so just  imagine like one of those old beautiful  courthouses with the staircases and the  railings and everything like that but  just empty there are also old jail cells  in there too really yeah in the basement  and also I think on the fourth floor  you feel like you're walking through like  Silent Hill or something yeah like one of  those creepy video games right so we went  where Dark Days was filmed where the mole  people used to live and that's below I 
[03:17:00]  guess the West Side Highway more or less  right yeah like underneath Riverside Park  Riverside Park really and that you could  kind of see the West Side Highway through  some of these gates that open up yeah it's  crazy because you're down there and you  can hear people like walking their dog  above you yeah wow we saw one yeah we  yelled that we yelled to all those like  oh great if fucking Moses was a serial  killer I'm fucked right now somebody was  getting a Frisbee or something and I didn't  know I thought that people still lived on  the ground I finally learned that that's  pretty much not true anymore there's a 
[03:17:30]  there's a few stragglers here and there but  in general people aren't living underground  in that area yeah no that's correct  because what happened was that was an  active rail line for decades it was a  freight line like you know the high line  right yeah so the high line used to  connect to that rail line and it would  take freight from from the Bronx or from  upstate down to the meatpacking district  that was the whole purpose and the  highlight for the people outside New York  they made it into a walking park it's  really cool you know railroads are  obviously above ground but they made it  it's really a nice little thing to check 
[03:18:00]  out if you come to New York so anyway  they decommissioned that as a freight  line in I believe 1980 and then that  entire tunnel was abandoned from 1980  until the 1990s when they started  yeah when they started running  yeah so that was just a giant wide open  space and that was perfect for people  to just go chill down there and and with  you know crack and like perfect timing  right the gritty dirty New York and  everything shit shanty towns uh popped 
[03:18:30]  up crazy down there how many people  live down there at its height I mean  nobody really knows my best guess would  be a couple hundred but I'm not that was  it I'm I'm not the guy yeah I mean stuff  gets exaggerated right right yeah but  then we uh you know we popped down one  of these uh holes yep and then this whole  world opened up it was so cool I mean I'm  not gonna lie I was trying to be cool but  soon as you said we're going down this  hole that was like I was ready to bail  I'm like no fucking way and he found 
[03:19:00]  that and the first hole we found was  just not just garbage like horrendous  garbage like almost sewagey garbage she's  like oh this is the only one I can find  today because these holes pop up yeah and  then uh you know the city takes you know  does covers them up and then they just  find another one you know they make  another one I do give you props for  meeting a strange man in a parking  following him down a hole in the ground  though would be the first time  that's not everybody will do that  hole so we found a hole and uh there 
[03:19:30]  you go I went to Moses you first he went  through he's got to lead the way sure  poked his head up right that's when I  there's a good one because he didn't  even know he didn't know if we're gonna  just drop straight down he's like no  it's a good one come on down that's when  I learned that I had forgotten the  flashlight and that my batteries were out  so nice yeah yeah so you just around  a while and then we're like it'll  probably be fine what go let your eyes  adjust and just uh kind of walk around  it's dark down there man yeah and then 
[03:20:00]  like the greats uh from above give you  some light and that's where all that  cool artwork was that you were showing me  yeah there's a bunch of great artwork  down there and Ed Koch I can't remember  if you were there on that trip or if it  was a different trip no I know what you're  gonna say yeah but Ed Koch died Friday  morning and we were there on a Sunday  afternoon and somebody had already  painted a rest in peace Ed Koch graffiti  really yeah down there really cool in  the darkness and now it's an active  railroad obviously yeah Amtrak Amtrak 
[03:20:30]  runs through there now when we saw I  think three or four and at one point we  thought it was one of those slow moving  fucking trains like it was like some  people that were gonna get us in  fucking trouble you even panicked I saw  it on your face like oh fuck this is  something we don't really see I mean I  try to play it cool but I'm always  really nervous on these things right so  right right I would think yeah you're  getting some people some people are just  some people just don't give a fuck some 
[03:21:00]  people are just like on we go we're good  I'm always really nervous and have to  try to like kind of play it cool well  some like that is one thing but the  the Chrysler building that seemed like a  little more you could get in pretty big  trouble for I mean I disagree I mean I  don't know I mean while we're on the  radio talking about I guess we'll find  out but it's like you know it's all  above board you know there's nothing  shady so I don't know I don't know it's  just off the floor is just empty I read 
[03:21:30]  I read recently an article was put out  about people saying that urban explorers  were helping terrorism that's a silly  showing the weaknesses of I mean that's  that's that's the silliest thing in the  world man it's like one of those things  where like it's 2013 folk like if you  like think you're gonna put the internet  back in a box it's not gonna happen  yeah so it's you know the MTA has an  official Twitter feed where they have  photos of the tunnels you know you can go 
[03:22:00]  to the library and get architectural plans  for everything like it's just stuff is  out there and it's a much better tack to  take to teach people about the city and  teach them like here is what's where how  you can get out of places in an  emergency it's much better to have more  knowledge rather than less knowledge  what Moses is saying he thinks everyone  should have the opportunity to stand on  that eagle head and apply to the top of  the spire that's pretty where no one has  ever been or very few people have ever  that's pretty fucked up I was watching 
[03:22:30]  that I was looking at that that's crazy  spire is cool I made a mistake though  that's not and I got called out for it  on I think the YouTube comments or  something where all that concrete stuff  that's like a fireproofing right right  that's and I messed that up in the  video so that's the opportunity but we  we leave the underground tunnel we  didn't we didn't get to run into the  cat lady who's still living down there I  wanted to talk to her what's her name  again Brooklyn Brooklyn yeah a lady named  Brooklyn and that has how many cats a  lot oh man like a lot like dozens I 
[03:23:00]  would say dozens would be accurate  dozens of cats she lives down there full  time and the only reason I bring this  up Moses and his pals before he took me  around they they spent the night down  there with with her right for her  birthday or something yeah so this was  that's fucked up yeah you can read about  in the New York Times my buddy Steve was  doing a big underground trip that you know  he did a lot more than just that tunnel but  I just joined him for just the night in  the tunnel with a few other friends of  mine and yeah it was fun we had a party 
[03:23:30]  it's if you look up I think it's called  the wilderness beneath your feet on the  New York Times it documents it it's got  the whole story right I would just think  with with something like the Chrysler  building people would be afraid you know  I mean that's an iconic building that  maybe some shenanigans up there would go  on and and you know people because you  try to get into this building you're  hoping they're gonna talk to us no no no  I'm just saying you go into this building 
[03:24:00]  and security is crazy right it would  seem to me like God why wouldn't there  be well more security you think well I  just want to walk people through it so  then we jump in a cab we're way up near  Harlem when we finally got out of the  tunnel we walked you said three miles  underground two and a half two and a half  miles on the ground finally got out  where you get out without really giving  their way to everybody and the only  people we saw were other people  exploring by the way down there yeah  every time I go I run into other folks  taking really doing whatever yeah not  many I'm in a handful of I guess every 
[03:24:30]  time you're down there and then we  jump in a cab because I got something  really cool but I don't want to tell  you I'm like all right I guess I got  to trust you even though I've only  known you three hours come on you know  we bonded in the tunnel we did all right  and then we're in the cab and then I  see the Chrysler building coming up I'm  like holy fuck I think we're going to  the fucking Chrysler building no  fucking way and what am I allowed to  say nothing okay well then we all I'm  saying is I'll say this we then we  arrive it's obvious we're going into  the Chrysler building and I could say 
[03:25:00]  this much we got in the building  legit I can say yeah yeah absolutely I  mean we weren't breaking any laws yeah  we I don't know what laws we broke  official that day but I certainly know  we didn't like illegally enter the  Chrysler building yeah I don't think any  actually like yeah I mean the the 61st  floor is just empty that amazes me the  61st floor is obviously the old  observational deck or observation deck  now the old observation deck is 71 and  that's actually oh you know what I got  confused by that too yeah the old  observation deck was all indoors it's 
[03:25:30]  on 71 it's a private office now 61 it was  just an office building and it was  there was a lawyer's office wait the  one with the Eagles heads what floor is  that 61 oh oh so they have an  observation day they used to it closed  and I think 1945 oh I thought where we  were was the observation deck that was  closed 1945 why wouldn't that be the  observation deck with the Eagles right  there no they should make it an  observation deck they will make outside  there they will make more money than if  they rented out as an office and they 
[03:26:00]  will especially make more money than if  they just keep it empty like I if I  would totally make that into an active  observation deck would be like so great  now I want to know what's on the 71st  floor 71st floor is I forget what kind of  office is there but it's a private  office it looks kind of the same as the  other floor right one because the  observation deck I just assumed was the  floor with the Eagles because that all  would make sense you go outside you take  the pictures near the Eagles I think it  would be the coolest thing in the world I  would definitely pay ten dollars to go 
[03:26:30]  out there yeah maybe even 20 who knows  so then we get up to all right so that  was 61 we got up to 61 it's an empty  office and I couldn't believe it I was  like you gotta be kidding me this whole  floor is empty and it's just me and him  and these these iconic Eagles I mean it's  a great place there the last time I was  there they're doing work on it so I'm  pretty sure it's gonna be rented up soon  if it's not already well they were  working on it yeah they had you went back  after I went I've been up there a few  times since yes I think so I yeah I mean 
[03:27:00]  I've lost track but yeah Wow and then you  know I'm I'm taking a look around outside  we got outside and the guardrails not too  high that was a little freaky yeah but  it's fine no I was all right what I'm  not saying I was all right with that and  then I'm just kind of taking a look  around checking out going holy fuck I  can't believe I'm checking this out and  then I turn to my left and you're just  like sitting on the Eagles head without  even telling me well yeah I mean at first 
[03:27:30]  point of like going ninety nine percent of  the way there and then like film that at  first I mean we did some things  afterwards but I'm like he's that this  is so no big my point is it was such a  no big deal to you that you just walked  out there you didn't need to get my  attention or anything you're like I'm  here I love being here I'm gonna go sit  out on the Eagles head for a little  while while he takes a look around yeah  yeah I mean it makes perfect sense like  think of it this way right you have this  table here this table is made this like 
[03:28:00]  part right here is maybe the size of the  Eagles head even like you if I told you  jump up and stand on right here you'd be  like whatever no big deal you know it's  not all understand how you have you know  I'm able to ride a bike on a sidewalk  without ever thinking I'm gonna veer off  and and you know right hit the grass right  but if you put that over the Grand Canyon  yeah put a floating sidewalk above the  Grand Canyon you would lose nine out of  ten people easy yeah even though they  would never yeah yeah well they made the 
[03:28:30]  point so so we're on 61 checking out the  Eagles and then and then that's what  Moses said to me I think we go higher  today I'm like what now what yeah so we  get up to we get up to the crown I guess  and it's yeah but how the triangular the  triangular windows yeah right but so we're  on 61 I think the elevator ended more or  less a little further up right but we  didn't use elevators at that point we're  just kind of walking the stairs where the 
[03:29:00]  stairs ends where the stairs ends at I  believe seven 76 I'm fairly sure is the  highest actual floor and then after  76 stories there yeah yeah and then after  that it's just like ladders and you got to  haul yourself up through a couple of  crossbeams at times it's just kind of  monkeying around I'm not gonna lie to  you we were in a certain area around 76  I'll say and it looked like we were at a  dead end and I was kind of relieved I was  like all right good I got some cool  footage I know I got a video or two out of  this this day let's get the fuck out of 
[03:29:30]  here and then of course this guy always  is trying to the little I know about it  but I've figured it out he's like now  man I can't give up now I'm here I got to  see if there's anything else I could do  before I you know call it a day and he did  a couple moves that I was just like what  the fuck and next thing you know well you  know his head is popping over the side  going hey meet me over here I'll just say  that I don't I'm and that's what that  was the floor where my video starts where  now we have to climb the ladders I mean 
[03:30:00]  I'm an okay climber but I'm not a  professional rock climber or anything you  know like I'm fairly in shape and can  make a couple moves but like I've been  places like I was with my friend Timmy  O'Neill who's a like a really great  professional rock climber and he's like  I've been you when I'm with him right he's  just like climbing around buildings and  shit and I'm yeah but it's just he knows  he can do it he's comfortable with it so  I don't freak out you know people have 
[03:30:30]  that how do they access to some of those  antennas and electronics up there for  maintenance well I mean that's the thing  right all of these places are places that  human beings have to go right maintenance  for repair for whatever like that so  there's always a way to get there yeah  yeah but some I have a friend of mine  also who works on a telephone repair and  you know it's the same he's always  telling me I should go be a telephone  pole repairman or something like that or  a cell phone antenna repairman yeah 
[03:31:00]  you're not scared of heights at all huh  not really I'm pretty good with heights I  mean it doesn't freak me out now thanks  to you I now get anxiety because I feel  so bad I didn't know I'm not even joking  I was no I was never that guy but since I  filmed you on the Eagle I've just seen  you I'll tell you to your face I've seen  you fall a million times as I'm trying  to go to sleep at night all right I just  see how it could easily happen has this  as this affected his performance at work  in the mornings is he all right I think  he's okay but no I just not that bad but 
[03:31:30]  I I just I just see it reason number  20 that he can't sleep so hidden cities  man you haven't really talked about the  book so I'm gonna take us through the  book a little bit all right so it's  hidden cities it's available in bookstores  everywhere on the internet all like that  and it's just a memoir of me adventuring  around the world trying to go places I  want to go see things I want to see it's  starts in about 2005 is when I started to 
[03:32:00]  really get into this I went around a  bunch of places with my buddy Steve  Duncan who's a really really great  photographer and you should check out  his website to undercity.org go there so  it's the kind of thing where I started  by going we started going to France was  the first place abroad we went went to  Italy so you got a lot of money no I  travel really cheap so everybody asked me  this right I was working as a double  decker tour bus guide when I did all  this stuff right hustling for $20 an 
[03:32:30]  hour on the tours $10 an hour if you're  if you're waiting for tours right so I  travel really cheap it doesn't cost any  money to sleep in a tunnel right and  it's the kind of thing where when you're  a tour guide there's high season and  low season so we did most of these  trips in the winter like in February  when there's got tourists money is not  like you can travel cheap nowadays time  is harder than money getting the time to  do this stuff challenge all right so you 
[03:33:00]  go to France and Italy yeah we went to  France we went to Italy Naples and Rome we  went to Sweden London Russia Russia was  the scariest man we almost got arrested  in Russia that was probably the scariest  moment I've ever had in my life yeah we  just so we're we're in Russia right and  we meet some local Russian kids and for  those of you who don't know the Russians  are the craziest motherfuckers in the  world we see their videos exactly yeah  hang and do their push-ups and pull-ups I  should say yeah it's the kind with one 
[03:33:30]  arm thousand feet off the ground somebody  tweeted they were like me is less than  these guys is less than every Russian  teenager and I was just like that is so  true  some of that shit where they're just  hanging you weren't trying to say you  were that's crazy you weren't trying to  say that you're better than these guys  they're on a whole nother yeah they're  on some crazy thinking he's doing pull-ups  from an I-beam that's just you know you  fall you're just dead yep how do they get 
[03:34:00]  up there they just they don't give a  fucking Russia they let the kids go  wherever the hell they want huh pretty  much there's some great videos of them  there's these seven buildings called the  seven sisters in Moscow that are topped  by stars like the red communist star and  they like one of their games is to try to  get to the top of all seven of the stars  they have videos like reach for the star  number two number three I don't know if  they've gotten up all seven but anyway  so we're in Russia and we're hanging  out with these Russian guys and oh good 
[03:34:30]  lord I'm watching that it's Sam looked  away he's on a high beam about how many  feet would you say that offhand oh a few  hundred at least yeah five six hundred  feet maybe definitely you're dead I think  that he's doing pull-ups and he's letting  go you know let's go first split second  oh wait is that the top of the Moscow  bridge in Kiev is it I don't know but I  know it's not there was so there was this  one bridge we climbed in Kiev and we  kind of went the easy way we went 
[03:35:00]  inside and up to the top and I was  feeling all cool with myself and then  like later I see this video of like  these rut like this 15 year old Russian  girl who like climbed up the stay cables  and did it like the insane way in the  middle of the day and I'm like well I'm  not cool and Russian bruts yeah so  anyway we're in Russia lady is that  talent for a stripper pulse climb right up  them stripper pulse love them Russians and  we decide to go in a tunnel we decide to  go on the underground Naglinka River  which Moscow was formed at the  intersection of the Moscow River and the 
[03:35:30]  Naglinka River and then they put the  Naglinka River underground so we decide  to go through the Naglinka River and  we're out kind of at the outskirts of  the ring road and we pop a manhole and  the guy we're with is like you know  dressed in this like semi-official  looking vest and I'm like is this cool  are people gonna stress and he's like no  no the only time people care about  anything is by the Kremlin with the  special government police and we're like  okay fine so we go down into the tunnel  and we're walking along and it's I think  like maybe a couple of miles and we get 
[03:36:00]  to the end and we've walked right under  Red Square come on I swear to God  impossible shit so we're under Red Square  we come to the outflow and it's kind of  raining a little bit just like a little  bit and for those of you contemplating  draining or going underground or whatever  the like number one cardinal rule is do  not go in drains if it's raining or  gonna rain because you will completely  die really yeah because everything even  if it's only a little trickle everything 
[03:36:30]  that hits cement is eventually going to  roll into the gutter and then go into a  small drain and then go into the big  collector drain where you are so you know  your drain is let's say eight feet by  eight feet that is not large enough to  handle the runoff for an area of like  acres around you that's coming at you so  if you're in a drain when it rains you're  just you know the water level levels just  so we start to kind of freak out we're  like we got to get out of here we run  back and the first manhole we come to is 
[03:37:00]  right by I want to say the Bolshoi theater  it's like the theater that's right by the  Kremlin and the guy we're with is like  okay this is like the worst way to get  out but we're just gonna pop the manhole  we're gonna scurry out and we're gonna  hope nobody's around in Russia man come  on I can see if it's in I don't know  Cleveland or something yeah so we're  like okay so we pop the manhole we  scurry out there's like I think I think 
[03:37:30]  that there's five or six of us and we're  right by this huge statue of Karl Marx so  we sit so we go out we put the thing in  the in the ground nobody else is around  we're like thank God we made it we're  okay we sit down by the Karl Marx instead  of getting the fuck out of there which is  like what you always always always should  do we just decide to like hang out and be  happy with ourselves and like we're all  wearing like rubber boots and hip waders  and have like these giant backpacks and 
[03:38:00]  tripod hanging off our backpacks and all  that thing so we're just hanging there  being happy with ourselves looking  completely ridiculous like why are we  dressed like we're gonna go fishing in  the middle of Red Square and we just get  rolled up on by these three like  government police machine guns and  everything it was just like the  scariest moment of my life I imagine  those guys are everywhere right you  can't do anything yeah so it ended up  being cool you know the Russian guys  talked to him for a while and  eventually they they took off we 
[03:38:30]  pretended we didn't you know well we  obviously didn't speak Russian but we  also pretended we didn't speak English  and we're just like oh no you know  playing dumb sometimes works but it was  like those five minutes between when  they rolled up on us and when they  left were just like I was like Jesus  Christ I'm gonna end my life in a  Russian prison like what is the point  of that like that could be an  interesting exploration yeah yeah  exactly right gulag gulag locked up  abroad yeah then you do it locked up  abroad so crazy there's so much in the 
[03:39:00]  book but where were some of the coolest  places some of the ones that some of  the highlights that you really were  like holy cow man um so I'm gonna spoil  the end of the book which I maybe  shouldn't do but that the second to  last chapter of the book we're in  Egypt and I really wanted to climb the  pyramids and just read the book but  the circumstances didn't allow for it  and it completely graded on me for like  two and a half years and finally a  couple of months ago I went back and 
[03:39:30]  did it so I was I was and you know  who's doing it now all the crazy  Russian Skywalker climbing guys oh  yeah all are all really into it so  yeah obviously you were trying to go  legit and and climb the pyramids what  no back then when they said no oh you  just you just couldn't figure out a  workaround I just bottled it I just  got I just got too scared and just  couldn't figure it out and bottled it  yeah so you climbed to the top of the  one of the pyramids yeah really fun with  a couple of friends isn't that kind of  hard because those blocks no the  fucking the climbs pretty easy it is 
[03:40:00]  yeah the climb is the oh that's it  right there oh yeah oh wow my god is  that cool where's this picture that's  on Twitter I think I tweeted it yeah  that's my that's my friend the guy who  took it is are you at the top top right  there yeah yeah the guy who took it is  the guy at the right that's my friend  my friend QX who's in the book how the  fuck did you do that I you just do it  like all these like a lot of times  people are like how did you do that  what is there a secret tunnel is there 
[03:40:30]  like a code or a password or something  like that and the answer is like  honestly just the way you think you do  it you know you just wow sneaking in the  middle of the night and just do it right  there's no guards I mean if there are  they're pretty lazy about it so I  actually the how long did that climb  take maybe like 20 minutes I want to  say okay and it was pretty easy  obviously I mean it was it was  exhausting it was definitely like an  exhausting climb but it wasn't  technically difficult now Wow Wow and  that's what the top looks like the top 
[03:41:00]  is covered in scratches like every  square inch of the top is like you  know Joe was here 19 really 52 like the  entire thing yeah because the things  are 3,000 years old you know there's  been a lot of time you can climb up them  until the 80s until the 80s it was just  kind of chill or maybe you know tip the  guard something and do it they only  started getting uptight about it in the  mid 80s so a lot of this stuff is stuff  that 50 years ago or a hundred years 
[03:41:30]  ago or you know even 20 30 years ago is  not a big deal and it's only a big deal  now like you could climb the pyramids in  the 80s you could go to the observation  deck of the Chrysler building in the  1940s like I sneak into Stonehenge here  just after hours just kind of walked up  and hung out of Stonehenge for a little  bit what do you see after hours that you  don't see during the day during like  it's just you go during the day you roll  up they send you through the tchotchke  shop you pay 15 quid you have these  ropes everybody stand behind the ropes  taking pictures if you just go at night 
[03:42:00]  to do whatever you want like you can go  you go there you walk up the hill you  hang out you kiss the rock I don't know  it's just a different experience you know  it's a it's a different experience right  but you know you could do that just hang  out when at Stonehenge 70 years ago so a  lot of this stuff is not new I mean I  want to stress that like none of this is  new or discovery or whatever a lot of  it is just as more and more people  travel as you know things go on it 
[03:42:30]  become more and more and more restricted  and this is kind of a response to that  restriction if stuff was more chill it's  it wouldn't be a big deal you think this  book is gonna fuck it up for others I  just I don't think so I mean it's a I  don't talk about a whole bunch of really  like tight stuff in the book a lot of  it is takes place between 2005 2007 and  the stories that were crazy to me back  in 2006 are not crazy stories so much  anymore I mean they will be for the 
[03:43:00]  reader but you're like not for me so  something like going into the catacombs  was the like I was like wow this is the  craziest thing I've done in my life I'm  flying across the world I'm going in a  hole in the ground and the catacombs are  like urban exploration 101 you know  really yeah absolutely but you could go  there on a legit tour right yeah you can  do what you get to do differently so on a  short tour of the catacombs they take you  down it's a it's a self-guided walking  tour you go down into the tunnels you walk 
[03:43:30]  for about I think about a half a mile or so  through the tunnels and it's where all the  bones are and the bones are like neatly  stacked and everything like that if you just  go in a different way through a hatch or a  hole in the ground you've got about a  hundred and seventy miles to navigate you  know it's not like a one little tunnel with  a nine meters path path it's like playing  dungeons and dragons holy you know it's  like it's like you look at the map and you're  like literally like wow when I was 13 I was a  you know half elf mage going through here 
[03:44:00]  it's really crazy you can spend a week down  there easy and I didn't realize it's so  big yeah no it's gigantic expensive it runs  almost from the Seine to the southern border  of Paris like it runs almost entirely under the  14th or on DC man like you can walk you I mean  well we we actually my friend Steve organized a  trip where we tried to walk underground  underneath Paris like underneath the entire  city of Paris so you can get from the southern 
[03:44:30]  border to almost the Seine like you can walk the  entire South Bank in the catacombs and then we  did sewers for the north but how do you guys  figure out where to pop out that's just  knowledge that's been passed around that's  like you got to know some folks sometimes to  figure that because this is like an underground  culture where you guys share information you  got a little something about New York I'm  going to trade for a little something about  Sweden or whatever right it's a I would call  it a network right like like with a guy  will climb the pyramids with he lives in  Paris and you know when I ever I go over 
[03:45:00]  there we always hang out and see stuff and  you know we hang out and see stuff when he  comes over here a lot of it are traveling  Australians Australians have these like  magic abilities to live anywhere and go  anywhere I don't know but yeah it's like a  worldwide network and you know you know  some people and some people know some other  people and there you go you ever got  arrested I got arrested in France once  actually it's the first story in the book  we climbed up the we were just we were just  boozed man we were just it's like half of 
[03:45:30]  these adventures are just like you're  boozed and you're like well it seems like a  good idea at the time so we're in France  we're super boozed this guy this French guy  we were with is like hey do you want to go  climb a church and we're like sure we're up  for climbing a church and like we cross the  river and I'm like I think the church he's  talking about is the fucking Notre Dame yeah  that's so we're just there and we just  monkey it like they've got these little 
[03:46:00]  scaffolding things and we fit a couple of  them together and we're rattling like crazy  and you know we get up a couple of the  terraces and like we just kind of like  finagle our way up and you know it's one  of those things we're like looking back on  it I don't know how it took so long for us  to get arrested but at the time I was like  it's France it'll be fine nobody will  notice but it was a very chill experience  France is a little more civilized than some  other places or a little more Latin so 
[03:46:30]  we're just up there the cops come up  they're like excuse us you cannot be here  take us to the station which is right  across the street stick us in a stick us in  a cell take our do a little breathalyzer  test thing and then after a couple of hours  they took us into the room the police  chief is there police chief is dressed  like you like you know just like casual  casual he's like okay so did you get good 
[03:47:00]  pictures we're like and I was like I was  freaked because like you know I watch cop  shows I'm not answering questions or  anything and I'm just like he's like you  know kind of rolls his eyes at me he has a  piece of paper is like okay so listen you're  tourists you are taking pictures you don't  know you can't climb cathedral you are very  sorry you don't do it again here sign this  you go away and I was like wow in America  I'm not signing anything a cop puts in  front of me and it's like sign this you  know but France it was just it's just 
[03:47:30]  France it's just a little more chill so I  was like all right and he's like he takes  his pen he gets up takes his pen walks out  of the door and just goes well like that just  yeah just throws it over his shoulder I  was like wow they are would not do that  if they caught me climbing St. Patrick's  probably didn't talk to the police just some  assholes I want to fuck with you yeah so  that that happened in France and yeah that 
[03:48:00]  was I got calling once here in New York  but I got out in a couple hours that was  an interesting experience now that's about  it nothing serious what was the one in New  York um I just got caught like not even  anything real just like kind of on the  wrong side of the fence that really should  be like a not a big deal but for whatever  reason they were uptight about it so they  took us in they got us out in like two or  three hours but it was just an interesting  experience like I'd never been in a New 
[03:48:30]  York City jail or anything so I was like  all right well we'll find out what this is  like so you know I just got thrown in with  essentially like the local knuckleheads for  a few hours and it was you know just seeing  that side of life and you know the thing I  took out of it is just like nobody was in  there for anything real you know people were  in there for like I got an open container or  like I was smoking weed or like you know just  piddly garbage things that it's like you know 
[03:49:00]  and they all uh like one of the guys got uh uh  collared for an open container and he had a  outstanding summons for riding his bike on  the sidewalk and you know they sent him  through the system like 24 hours in jail  without like you know just disappeared and  it's just like so a lot of folks in there were  just in there on like garbage stuff and it's  like ruins your whole next day getting a rest  record like it's just one of those things  where it's like it's a little out of control  right in my opinion now you said that uh the 
[03:49:30]  best place you'd like to be is on top of a  bridge I love yeah or any city actually  with how many bridges have you been on top  of a lot Brooklyn Bridge yep Manhattan Bridge  yep uh Williamsburg Queensborough have you  climbed outside yeah first of first of first we  all see those that shit when we're going  across bridges and you always kind of  imagine like I would be kind of cool to  exactly man every but that's where it ends  for most people right but like in Sydney  Australia they have a bridge climb and it's 
[03:50:00]  enormously popular it does like 60 million  dollars of business a year or something like  everybody goes it's like so cool and the  Sydney Harbor Bridge is probably the most  famous landmark on the continent you know so  it's something where people are like why do  you want to do that and I'm like don't you  want to do that and they're like well yeah  of course and I'm like well then you  answered your own question so I think I  mean I would love it if they could do you  know the equivalent of a Sydney Harbor  Bridge climb on the Queensboro I've said  that too yeah I think it would be I think 
[03:50:30]  it would make a ton of money and be great  for the city no shit but climbing on the  outside of the bridge however they would  well that's how they do it in Sydney  though yeah it's a man tells me there's  not many lawyers and yeah I know this is  but this is the kind of thing where if you  have like the will to figure it out like  you can get around the lawyer stuff like  I'm a firm believer that the people make  the decisions and then tell the lawyers  to make it work what I don't understand  about climbing bridges outside like that  is I mean what all the cars going by how  the fuck do you get away with it I haven't 
[03:51:00]  climbed a bridge in a while actually in  like you definitely you know in a while  because they're absolutely watching bridges  around New York City these days I mean  you have to go over that first fence the  one fence that you know people go all  right I got to climb over that and maybe  fall into the fucking river and then I get  on that thing and then I go up well you  know if you don't yeah it's it takes a  little bit of monkeying around fuck  takes a little bit of monkeying around  but you know sometimes it's I mean it's  worth it because being on top of a bridge 
[03:51:30]  is the most amazing experience because  like you get two different views you get  two different experiences like you've been  to Long Island City or Williamsburg and  you're looking across the river at the  skyline and that's awesome and you've  been up to like the Empire State Building  or whatever and you're looking down on  the city and that's also awesome if  you're on top of a bridge you get those  two things at once you get like the  vertical separation and the horizontal  separation it's this totally unique view  and plus like you know you're by  yourself you're on top of a bridge it's  like a really great experience 
[03:52:00]  jeez why are you guys shaking your  heads at me I'll drive on the bridge  no I think like that I absolutely think  it's cool it's just like yeah crazy  there's one other you ever have a near  miss where you had a little slip besides  the phone in the hole at the courthouse  no I've been pretty good so like getting  arrested getting hurt all of that stuff  all comes from just like getting too  happy with yourself and not paying  attention it doesn't come from like I've 
[03:52:30]  never had getting your flashlight or  forgetting your flashlight but I've never  had a near miss batteries we were all  right okay it was only you know only  fell in a hole once but it all comes  from not paying attention so the times  when I've ever been in like had any kind  of slips or near misses have always been  with stuff I was comfortable with and  just got too comfortable with it and did  stop paying attention all the crazy  stuff where I'm like really hyper alert 
[03:53:00]  and really like in the zone and focused  I've always been okay with right okay  and finally and brought this to my  attention the other day that someone  climbed up the World's Fair what is  that the observation tower oh yeah  observation towers at the World's Fair  there was a video recently was it a  video in or pictures pictures in his  story he used a grappling hook to get up  there because he couldn't is that my is  that Steve's old story that you found on  the website might have been because I  remember he had I mean that's got to be  from like 10 years ago yeah I really 
[03:53:30]  like that story I've always it was a good  one he's like he's at night he's trying  to throw the grappling hook and it's  going clang clang on the ground yeah  yeah that's Steve's story really yeah  that's a good one but that's from like I  think 10 years ago or like a while ago  and you've been up there too you said  right yeah I was up there once you know  not too long after that probably like  six or seven years ago oh no I take it  back I was up there twice we were  peeled off of there once just for fun  wow really yeah just off of the lower  deck not off of the super high deck and  you were telling me the stairs are all  gone right stairs are like super rusty 
[03:54:00]  and like oh you got the picture yeah you  kind of see yeah no real treads on the  stairs it just you got to kind of walk  up on the rails that the treads used to  be on and yeah that's actually one of  the better ones yeah geez louise how do  you get back down it's the same way you  get up although they but I know but it  just seems easier to climb up then when  you're seeing like it's a lot of stairs  missing and it's time to climb down and  that seems almost scarier climbing down is 
[03:54:30]  always easier for me because I'm already  in the zone and like it's less I don't  have to like get hyped up for it they  did renovate the tower a couple of years  ago so they might have painted it or  some shit I don't know yeah I don't  remember that but I mean that's another  place like throw in a new staircase and  let people up there again I mean  seriously it's a great view people would  pay yeah definitely it would pay to see  this shit cool just find it so funny  like you can't do anything in the city 
[03:55:00]  so I can't imagine them allowing you to  do anything that would be fun but  there's been there's been a lot of  stuff that's gotten reopened because you  have folks who go there kind of guerrilla  style take pictures people get into it  the highline like the highline was this  beautiful old old abandoned rail line  got a lot of attention from people just  walking on it taking pictures and now  it's redeveloped another one is the old  city hall station like this beautiful  beautiful old abandoned subway station 
[03:55:30]  underneath city hall that's one that  now they open for tours you got to join  the transit museum but you can go on a  tour like you can check it out yeah so I  think that like once interest in this  stuff becomes known people you know and  it's known that hey you know you can do  tours you can make a buck right stuff  happens and stuff gets opened like I  love abandoned observation decks and  they reopened the Rockefeller Center  observation deck was abandoned for 20  years well they reopened it and you  fool around the subways where you got 
[03:56:00]  to like time out the trains going by  and shit yeah I haven't been the  subways for a minute either I don't  reckon I mean that one is like you know  if you have the urge to go you're not  going to get talked out of it if you  don't have the urge to go you're not  going to get talked into it I feel like  it's just one of those things some  people really are into but I haven't  been in a minute so and that's to go  see the abandoned subway station yeah  there's a bunch of you know there's a  bunch of stuff in the subway any of the  big rats down there now see the thing  is everybody always asked me about 
[03:56:30]  rats and tunnels rats live where  there's food and there's food where  there's people so most of the rats in  the subway stations are actually in the  stations because that's where people  are and throw their garbage and stuff  like that they're not in the tunnels  because there's no food in tunnels I  have run into rats in the London sewers  though and it was really gross how big  oh like someone apparently cracked a rat  big and like a nice a nice colony  remember that someone cracked a rat  you let a nervous fart out Moses 
[03:57:00]  who me yeah I don't get nervous  who farted I don't know but wow  Sam is that you I'm a lady that's  terrible very cool well Moses I think  the book's gonna do very well I want  to have you back because there's so  much more we want to cover like people  want to you know talk about their  cities and stuff like that yeah cuz  every city has cool stuff to see  definitely I go to Rochester a lot and  I know I know not a lot once or twice  a year but they have a they have an  abandoned subway system up there yeah 
[03:57:30]  I've never been I would love to go I  just read some articles on it's pretty  damn cool what they were talking about  I would love to see it there's an  abandoned subway system in it's  actually not abandoned it was built  and never used in Cincinnati also so  there's why do they never use it I  don't know the entire story behind it  I know that you know they had  constructed it and I think they ran  out of funding or something like that  I don't know the entire story behind  it I just know there's this entire  system in Antwerp there's a system that  was built and not used Wow also you 
[03:58:00]  know wherever you are any city in the  world there's like stuff to see have  you got deep underground in New York  where the what are they called the the  mud where the drilling yeah what do they  call them oh the are you talking like  the second and even deeper than that  for the water tunnel number three no I  never been so yeah they call the  workers like mud mud rants from what  so I forgot sand hogs sand hogs are 
[03:58:30]  heroes of all of ours we think sand hogs  are like the coolest people in the world  so they're digging a bunch of tunnel  projects are doing digging a new tunnel  to Grand Central they're digging the  second Avenue subway they were they were  doing the west side line extending the  number seven line they're doing city  tunnel number three so there's a lot of  tunnels and the MTA especially has  been good about like letting  engineering students on tours and things  like you know for educational purposes  and stuff so I've gotten to go to a  couple of them just on official tours  like is it cool it's super cool man and 
[03:59:00]  it's the kind of thing where like I was  on the one where they're digging the  tunnel to Grand Central and I was like  why don't you do these tours all the  time and the guy was just like we got a  tunnel to dig man we can't right no  kidding all right fair enough you know  but I you know that's another thing  like so many people are interested in  it and I think they could you know  definitely take you know you can't do  a 24-7 but they could certainly take  more folks down there the city water  tunnel number three I've never been to  I'd really like to go on an excursion 
[03:59:30]  there oh yeah yeah it gets worse let's  get some asshole sniffing going let's  pep this place up into a mood of fun  festivity more of opian anthony's worst  of 2013  coming up  first year moments opian anthony's worst  of 2013  worst of 2013 for the opian anthony show  my name is rock and we're at the last  segment for today's show tomorrow we'll
