<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a post-Oscar discussion. Opie lamented his incorrect prediction that *Slumdog Millionaire* would sweep the awards, though he acknowledged its wins, including Best Picture, and the wins of Sean Penn and Kate Winslet.  They were surprised by Mickey Rourke's loss, speculating that his off-putting behavior may have contributed.  The hosts engaged in graphic descriptions of the sexual content in *The Reader*,  discussed Heath Ledger's posthumous win, and offered critical commentary on various celebrities' appearances and behavior at the ceremony, including Sophie Loren, Hugh Jackman, and Matthew Broderick. The Oscars' format and presenters' lengthy, insincere praise also drew criticism.

The show then shifted to internal station matters, fueled by rumors surrounding Adam Corolla's departure and potential format changes.  The hosts voiced concerns over a lack of communication from management, noting the removal of their show's signage. They attempted to get information from a seemingly intoxicated colleague, Maura.  Listener calls added to the discussion; one caller criticized Steve Martin's Oscars performance, and another, Carlos, described a somber atmosphere at a recently reformatted station, highlighting job losses and the loss of camaraderie.

The conversation returned to the Oscars, focusing on its perceived lack of humor compared to earlier formats.  *Taken* was discussed, with the hosts appreciating the action but criticizing the weak plot. A clip of Sean Penn's acceptance speech was played and analyzed.  A segment from a previous broadcast, "David and Bobo," featuring overwhelmingly negative listener feedback about David's interviewing skills, was played, followed by more listener calls and further Oscar discussion.

A significant portion focused on a protest at NYU organized by Farah Kimji and "Take Back NYU," which the hosts mocked, referring to the students with derogatory terms like "snotty kids" and "spoiled little children." The hosts spent considerable time on "The David and Bobo Show," highlighting David's inept interviewing of Bobo and the resulting listener criticism. This segment was interspersed with discussions about Citi Field's naming rights, rising sports ticket prices, and crude, sexually suggestive commentary on traffic reporter Melissa Mandak. A brief Black History Month tribute to Marvin from *Pulp Fiction* was included.

Another segment mocked sports radio's tendency towards overly detailed hypothetical trades, featuring absurd trades involving superheroes.  The hosts and a caller, Dave, engaged in this.  The hosts also heavily featured the website "Fat E-Rock.com," showcasing photoshopped images of E-Rock. A caller, Dawn from Monticello, shared a humorous anecdote about her emphysema.  "The David and Bobo Show" returned, with multiple calls criticizing David's interviewing style and his online behavior. Anthony revealed he'd anonymously called in to criticize the segment. Robert Kelly was a guest in the studio during this portion.

The final segment featured a discussion of a bizarre celery, Cool Whip, and banana snack suggestion, accompanied by vulgar and sexually explicit commentary.  The hosts continued to joke about David's Facebook activity and interactions with women.  Mike, the creator of FatErock.com, was mentioned again.  Old memos from former program directors Dave Douglas ("Dave Dickless") and Bruce Mittman were read, reprimanding Opie and Anthony for their on-air language.  The hosts reacted with amusement, continuing to use vulgar language.  Segments of "Fag Talk," a recurring bit using British slang for cigarettes for sexually suggestive humor, were played.  The hosts discussed their low pay and difficult living conditions in Boston.  The show concluded with more vulgar jokes and banter.

[00:00:30]  gives me the hi-yo hi-yo i am such a loser i saw slumdog millionaire right yeah i came in here i  think i was the first to see it or jimmy you saw it too early on yeah i think you guys actually  you saw before me and then i saw it next week it was really close but i came in here i saw slumdog  millionaire and i said slumdog millionaire will win everything i want them to pull the clip  so all i had to do was hang on and just believe in myself right yeah last night i i stopped in and i 
[00:01:00]  hung out with ron and fez a little bit you live in the city i live close i'm like what the hell i'll  go uh they did a pre-oscar radio show dude on the air last night i go you know i've been thinking  about this slumdog millionaire and i think uh you know what i think hollywood's gonna love that  benjamin button movie instead all i had to do was hold on to what i believe i would look like a hero  right now so i i said that benjamin button would win best picture and would win for other things 
[00:01:30]  because hollywood likes that type of movie making not that you know i i went against what i believe  yeah i didn't i didn't i didn't think benjamin button was a better movie but i just thought that  that was the type of movie hollywood just enjoys so now i blew it in i came in here and said that  slumdog would win everything you second guessed yourself and they pretty much won i think eight  out of ten last night slumdog millionaire eight academy awards to uh slumdog yeah i'm not like oh my 
[00:02:00]  god that's ridiculous but uh you know i liked it i thought it was good worthy of uh eight academy  awards man there we go i thought harvey milk was good i'm harvey milk i'm here to mcfuchu i did say  sean penn would win best actor over mickey rourke i was surprised i came through mickey rourke won  everywhere else i thought they're gonna give it to him again but i was happy i wanted sean penn to win 
[00:02:30]  well i think what happened with mickey rourke i think he had that award and then he started doing  interviews the last couple of weeks because you know the oscar buzz so everybody wants to talk to  you yeah and he was the wrestler in front of everybody so i think people started thinking you  know what i don't think he really was acting i think he was just being himself on film and the way they  were talking about it they were saying like uh treating him like right his he was his character in the  movie like this is his big comeback right and uh boy look at where he is now and you know when 
[00:03:00]  someone plays a character like like mickey rourke did in the wrestler and then you see them out of  character usually they're well dressed and well well well defined and not very intellectual but you  got the same guy you got the same guy that was in the wrestler yeah and i think that might have  messed up his chances he probably should have just like went away for a couple weeks yeah just  disappear and i think then people started thinking well sean penn was did a better job at acting 
[00:03:30]  yeah i think he did you know so sean penn won what best actor uh slumdog won best movie  and then after that it's pretty much who gives a crap right yeah director was a slumdog millionaire  yeah and then they both god they bring uh the whole goddamn uh india yeah brought all of india up  there strange little children and uh guys well it was all the different versions of the two main 
[00:04:00]  characters yeah growing up that and uh and the the one guy that uh played the host the millionaire  groping that small child in front of the whole time he was holding the little child in front of  the whole time i had to be creepily i had a millionaire i had a bell i was tired what the indian  regis yeah as a as a creepo uh millionaire so yeah uh slumdog wins best picture and then sean  penn we said for milk and kate winslet for the reader now for the reader let me tell you something 
[00:04:30]  about the reader i had no desire to to see the reader based on the synopsis right it's the synopsis  for it just sucked they didn't know how to describe these movies this year because uh we said a slumdog  millionaire i thought was one of these fun little indie films that wasn't gonna hurt anybody yeah  and then when i started watching that movie i'm like wow i had no idea how horrific this movie was  i thought it was just a cute little movie about a guy trying to win some some buckos yeah uh well 
[00:05:00]  the same thing with the reader my my girl goes home to philly and i was lucky enough to have a legal  screener copy of the reader she brought it home with her this reader movie is porn  kate winslet kate winslet is is pretty much naked throughout the entire movie she's doing there not  only is she naked she's teaching the young lad all all sorts of different sexual positions  she's kind of changed since the old painting of uh her in the titanic 
[00:05:30]  uh a little sag to the uh yeah the boobs are acting like the titanic they're just kind of  what happened to those those up globe what happened to the full feeders now they're a little yeah a  little uh a little longer uh but this movie yeah see there you go this movie is uh there's a lot of  nudity and uh she's teaching the young lad all sorts of different sexual positions and my girl about that 
[00:06:00]  and my girl was sitting there with her parents watching this thing feeling really uncomfortable  because it wasn't the basic nudity you get in your films this was like this was pretty hardcore  because it was it was important to the storyline right so now i want to see the reader although now  that i saw the screen caps of her her not so stellar boobs i'm not really sure anymore let me tell you  though uh screen caps will never do justice to a moving picture of nudity always a little awkward  screen caps but uh yeah you get her moving around a little jiggle in there that might 
[00:06:30]  yeah pep it up a bit just a little yeah oh is that the titanic one yeah see that  she was a little more uh you know that was 12 years ago god damn really effing years ago that titanic  movie wow you know what she for 12 years all right 12 years gone by whatever she might have to like  you know fill him up a little bit yeah some kind of work done can you fill him up just a little bit 
[00:07:00]  yeah go pull up to the gas station just a couple what is that what's that from eric uh 1996 a movie  called jude yeah she loves getting naked this kate winslet is she groomed at all nope wow nope that is  a muskrat jude what is that when a camera film comes out and tells you that your date is jewish and  you don't know it oh i've been jew oh darn  all right well uh there you go so she won for the reader and uh it's a movie you know that has a lot 
[00:07:30]  of nudity so now i gotta now i gotta go see that and then of course heath ledger and i'm that was so  i don't think anything has been more obvious in oscar history like jimmy was saying just before the show  like like they like to give that little twist at the oscars like oh everyone is assuming this but  then this happens yeah sort of with uh the sean penn thing because mickey work was winning a lot of  the uh the awards leading up to the oscars uh-huh but this heath ledger i mean there was going to be 
[00:08:00]  no surprise there yeah it was so obvious he was going to win that uh that award and i was  disappointed i thought we were going to see a corpse oh too soon a little too soon  the uh the awards show itself um hugh jackman yeah i don't know who he's trying to fool with that  wife uh and kids well just about every single one of those guys dude hugh jackman seems like one of 
[00:08:30]  the gayest individuals i've ever seen he loves broadway yeah he's hosted the tonys yeah uh it's  less or greater you know those symbols less yeah greater than anderson cooper more gay  great anderson cooper if anderson cooper wink i'm just saying nudge nudge was i'm not saying anyone's  gay i'm not dragging anyone out of the closet i'm just saying in my opinion more gayer than anderson 
[00:09:00]  cooper yeah and he's wolverine for god's sake the guy's kicking ass i love that and uh  you see speaking of which did you see matthew uh broderick and his new look  he's decided to look like uh nathan lane yeah a bit he's another one he's taking old uh horse face and  uh yeah that's his beard yeah yeah yeah and yeah just look hugh jackman that's what he was dressed 
[00:09:30]  like last night i missed that i don't think that was last night okay no but that's like it probably  at a tony's and and his mannerisms everything doesn't come off as very gay but uh well he's an  actor actor he's an actor and they said that the oscars were going to be taking uh quite a different  approach this year uh than in past when it's because there's been a comedian as a host since  i think 1985 or something like that right and uh they took a different approach which made it more 
[00:10:00]  longer and more drawn out than i've ever seen it instead of just saying and the nominees are  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah they brought out celebrities past oscar winners to come out  and individually kiss the ass of the nominees of each nominee of each nominee and so for best  actress they drag out a bunch of uh actresses and a couple of them are doing a great job of actually 
[00:10:30]  making the nominee actresses cry and and what you did with this moment in time blah blah blah on film  you put down an emotion that captured the nation's attention and they're and they're  and you see him mouthing thank you thank you i know i'm great yeah i know i'm great  i just keep telling myself i'm actually great holly holly berry stupid holly berry then yeah like 
[00:11:00]  reads it off a teleprompter pretty much yeah ruins the whole like mood ruins that whole vibe that they  had that they were actually being sincere yeah you had a feeling that they were kind of just like  talking off the cuff and your performance in the reader yeah yeah they put together they were acting  which is what they do so they were doing a good job of like acting like they gave a crap about the  nominees and i'm like wow they're they're making them cry they do and then hallie berry gets up there 
[00:11:30]  and she's squinting she doesn't have her glasses and she's just like what you have done like she's  reading it like oh you stink and then sophie lauren yeah oh leather face holy jesus wow  she uh i thought that was hell boy coming up on stage it was horrible wow she what happened to  her she is a color a human should not be right that's an orange and i don't think it's healthy  some tan thing and then they showed her from the back oh like a dry uh riverbed yeah that was just 
[00:12:00]  her ass was it was flat i saw flat air yeah very flat and fat you know she's no kid that's for sure  yeah uh but oh and then they did the same thing for the actors you know they drag out uh academy  award-winning actors i guess five or six of them whatever and they start talking and they had the  one guy with the from the piano there when we were the pianist remember him yeah yeah brody there i 
[00:12:30]  like to say that guy adrian brody and he's talking about frank langella's performance in uh frost  nixon sure and he's telling uh langella that he did an amazing job as richard nixon uh he brought to  the screen richard nixon as had never been seen before blah blah blah and there's um a man uh  what's his name jesus can't think of anybody's name oh uh uh uh uh uh uh kind of electric dude 
[00:13:00]  anthony hopkins anthony hopkins right there's anthony hopkins who played nixon all right on stage  waiting to intro the next guy so he's kind of like you know looking so why wouldn't they have i  played nixon why don't they have anthony hopkins do the freaking nixon thing and they could have  twisted in some way like i most you know a lot of people thought i did such a great job yeah but  wow but it's just adrian brody pretty much slapping yeah uh anthony hopkins in the face right  for his portrayal of nixon by saying langella did such a great job should just turn to him and said oh  yeah you did nixon yeah oh i forgot we all forgot about your performance wait was it a joke that 
[00:13:30]  was missed like was it maybe no you know they don't know how to do jokes they weren't really joking so  if it was a joke that missed it was so obscure and so weird it's a good question because they just  stood there and were they were just kissing the ass of these people they weren't really joking about  except for because it was a serious moment jimmy de niro with sean penn he had one funny line about how  did you ever get a role playing non-gay guy yeah yeah how'd you ever get a role playing straight guy 
[00:14:00]  yeah it was uh i don't know i can't watch him speak though without thinking of your impression of him  when he walked out all i started doing was  and it was so hard to watch some of the clips of uh him as a young guy picking up his oscar and stuff  oh unbelievable and and they went through the um the death montage oh see i missed the death  oh the death montage i heard they were going to cut the audio did they do that or were you allowed 
[00:14:30]  to applaud for your no dead guy you know what they did they that's one of my favorite parts  they had queen latifah you know that sassy black woman they had her singing please tell me she's in  the montage yeah why do they try to make her a sex symbol stop i know stop it you're stop it with  the makeup commercials you're you're a slob you're a big-ass black woman all right anyway you're not  sexy in any stretch of the imagination so she's singing the song through the montage so you couldn't 
[00:15:00]  really applaud in the middle of it and i guess that was a way of keeping it shorter but they still  applauded some people got and some people got the louder where we like this dead guy better than this  all right take keith ledger out of it because obviously he got the thunderous applause probably  who was uh up there as far as uh biggest one popular dead hall newman oh well paul newman  beating out keith ledger yeah he got the big one and it was the last one well that was an upset and  they showed a little um clip of one of his movies so they had some audio of him uh talking and stuff 
[00:15:30]  uh yeah but uh other dead guys um ricardo he got pretty good uh applause for dead guy  and then uh you know the black guy that died recently the comic there um bernie mack bernie  mack bernie mack sure they gave you know gave him some applause but she was singing a song over that  yeah yeah that's kind of distracting over it yeah yeah see that they didn't they don't want no i was  reading up on this they don't like the fact that people are applauding for their favorite dead guy 
[00:16:00]  so they were trying to like mask that by having queen latifah sing a little song but that's gonna be a  tough spot for her well they didn't show her singing it right they kind of showed her start  it and then they went off and just started showing some of the what was the song she was saying oh  no it's some maudlin this is the end my only friend the end but doesn't that show you how  typical it is like let people clap for who they like like you know what nobody cares about the 
[00:16:30]  musical guy or or the or sorry or the key grip right they show some old black and white picture  of some guy splicing film yeah and you're like wow i'm not clapping it's safe to say and i'm sure  it's gonna be said a lot today but the oscars they sucked i know that's the in thing to do and say you  know they're not like they used to be and all but they really were awful i think we've reached the  time where it's almost like the variety show thing we were talking about that like in the 70s and 
[00:17:00]  even 80s and stuff the variety show is a completely acceptable form of entertainment yeah you took a  stupid celebrity that might have had one movie or even a sports figure a singer and you gave them  a variety show yeah where they would have guests and come on and people watched it they were ratings  grabbers and now you know we just kind of grew past it and i think a lot of these award shows we're  just kind of getting over these things and that were they're not entertaining anymore they're passe 
[00:17:30]  i would you know a night for hollywood to honor its own if i was if i was the guy in charge that i  would just i'd make every single one of those people go up there without a script without it  without anything and i mean because that's what the whole media world is all about off the coffin  didn't they try that one year i don't know they tried that one year where they had no teleprompter  but people would watch that like wow look how is sean penn without a without it the words written 
[00:18:00]  down yeah could halle berry pull it off talking about this actress without without anything prepared  i submit to you no yeah but that but you know what hollywood would never allow those guys to  be shown naked on a stage basically they would never do that they'd look like idiots all right we're just  getting started i also think one of the things that's happened is everyone's got it's gotten so  political and everyone's tried to be so smart and so meaningful and they're becoming just just such  a bunch of drips yeah and the only good thing about the oscars is watching a guy like chris rock 
[00:18:30]  kick them in the teeth it's fun watching them get kicked in the teeth but there's such hypersensitive  babies they can't be kicked in the teeth they want to be taken seriously and in the era of reality tv  and all these websites where you could see people's heads being lopped off yeah just watching  a bunch of douches self-congratulate is very very dull you know what good point and and if i may  elaborate on that a second james uh back in the day as they say uh you would see these celebrities 
[00:19:00]  in movies and on award shows and when you saw them on award shows that was pretty much the only time you  saw them being themselves even if they are reading a teleprompter they would bring them out and you were  kind of like wow look at there there's robert de niro you know right there's a another you know  famous actress uh meryl streep that you know you don't see them outside of the movies right now with  uh tmz all these celebrity sites the internet you can see these people cursing at their directors 
[00:19:30]  uh do it just being people uh the the vulture paparazzi and videorazzi come up uh and and we have  more accessibility to these celebrities than we ever did so i think the award show that's why it's  so passe it's like look we see these people with their you know with their figuratively speaking  their clothes off uh so the award show isn't special right yeah i make a great point very yeah  they're not just they're just not these interesting people who need a warm night yeah warm fuzzy hugs 
[00:20:00]  yeah drop dead all right with that we're gonna take our first break we got uh sean penn's acceptance  speech acceptance acceptance speech yeah his opening line was great yeah i'll be trying to like keep it  keep it fun i guess apparently he's a well aware of how much people hate him yeah absolutely and then  uh yeah we got some audio to play for you guys just getting warmed up opie and anthony also we'll get 
[00:20:30]  your thoughts on the oscars 877-212-0 and day the constant oh boy this is professional  breakdown best who gives a crap right there you go good morning welcome to the open show that's how  it's supposed to sound when we came back we're just lucky to be here right guys happy to be here  way to go you rock way to go way to go with that rumor thing way to go you rock knows everything  what happened nothing happened nothing happened they're hinting strongly that this vine radio 
[00:21:00]  station is going chr got it right here in front of me i thought it was uh hinting strongly that it's  the other one well that's kind of what i heard maybe the company could uh do the right thing and give  us some kind of clue that would be very nice well the keys work so that's a good clue yeah that's good  we've worked off and on for you guys for 10 years how about you help us out a little bit  and tell us which way you're leaning because david hinkley writes today a top 40k rock really 
[00:21:30]  corolla sends a signal adam corolla said bye-bye to his uh radio show out there in la he's gonna be  doing the podcast thing i think we're all gonna be doing the podcast thing in the near future i think  that's where this whole thing is going adam corolla finishes run on a los angeles radio station friday  by strongly suggesting that a cbs station in new york will change formats speculation immediately  focused on the possibility of rocker k-rock flipping to a top 40 format which is what happened with cbs's 
[00:22:00]  klsx in los angeles which cut corolla loose its top format became top 40 97.1 amp radio friday  afternoon and by the way 923 amp radio or whatever the hell was blocked oh it was yeah but i'm  suspicious that it might be one of our clowns oh i don't know though but the website the website has  officially been bought all right check who bought it corolla no you can't really corolla said cbs had 
[00:22:30]  talked to him weeks ago about coming to new york it was a done deal then the new york office was pulled  off the table uh then the new york offer was pulled off the table they're doing some flipping over  there i'm not mentioning the specific station for a reason cbs is making sweeping changes  and of course cbs has no comment on any of this right how about how about you let us know a little  bit though yeah maybe a little bit behind the scenes maybe a little comment for us that would be nice 
[00:23:00]  well the opian anthony sign is off the wall that's good yeah which would also not be a good sign but  every sign is off the wall not cbs fm oh really cbs fm is not on the wall see what's weird is the  whole everybody left this facility to go downtown where we were told we're staying here but they  removed the opian anthony sign now i i like to think i'm a pretty smart person yeah if we're going to 
[00:23:30]  still broadcast here why would you have to remove that one and all the k rock signs i do believe  right right and all the upper brass who are wearing amp hats right and then maura yeah maura was uh  staggering around here like a like a drunk 5 15 in the morning maura who used to be the gm until she  was uh demoted because that's what's happening in radio nothing to do with her abilities she's she  pops her head into our office i'm like what are you doing here she goes just getting home from my 
[00:24:00]  oscar party at 5 15 in the morning is she still here uh i don't know yeah well we'll check her old  office she should be walking around with one of those hats that holds two beer cans just a whiskey  bottle and straws yeah safe to say safe to say that she likes her brewskis oh boy does she  meister brown a can oh uh you rock you got some more gossip no uh laura's um hiding in one of the 
[00:24:30]  production studios holding her head in the dark why is she here i don't know is she supposed to be  at work for the big format change maybe she's laying down she doesn't have her shoes on she's just  waving me off leave her alone are you kidding she's waving you off do we have any wireless mics around  here why would we what where is she all the way down the hall on the other side like all the way  down yeah could someone get a little interview with her yeah we'd like you know get some audio  at least a little foot worship session what is i would love to know why she doesn't want to go 
[00:25:00]  home what's that about a little busy all right been out we'll try to get uh her on the air somehow  some way steve on long island what's up steve hey guys what's going on hello just uh hello  speaking of things that didn't work um i was enjoying the show and then steve martin walked  on at that point my blood curdled and then i uh proceeded to fall on the floor and throw up cancer  on the carpet was that when he stinks and i don't like him was that when he came out with tina fay 
[00:25:30]  yes tina fay is so effing funny man oh god she really is a funny broad but she was out there  with steve martin and uh i don't know what it is because growing up i loved steve martin and i can't  now and when i when i said all right you know what why why how about we just frunkus all morning  how about we just all frunkus he could not throw in more show right now you know you kidding about  you kid about frunkusing all morning but i think it'd be good for everyone but i used to know him too 
[00:26:00]  man it's hard to watch him now i don't know what it is i think it has to be this whole thing he did  with the pink panther series i can't like that caller said i can't stomach even looking at him  anymore i think what it is too it's it's that smug it's his cheaper by the dozen movie poster face  right yep it's the right it's the kind of half squinted eyes and the smirk it's like he's just a  little too delighted with himself father of the bride three yeah and you know he thinks he's a 
[00:26:30]  brilliant art collector and he's a banjo connoisseur it's like just shut up he's so much  there it was oh it's a funny oscars host too i mean i like it's so much better than uh than  everybody look at that face he does try to come across like no one is as funny as i am and i know  he's trying to play that a little bit but i think he really believes that and i think that's one of the  problems i have with him what did he do on the oscars last night he came out with tina fey that a little  back and forth you know do we have it was it terrible uh well now that it's been mentioned 
[00:27:00]  yeah we could get that from the boys uh okay in the uh the back office let's say hi to carlos in  california carlos hey hey i want to talk to you what that's monday carlos hey carlos what are you  doing hello carlos well i'm a little drunk from the night before oh you're a little drunk from the  night before ah okay oh boy and there's a big shift between like the sound like how loud you 
[00:27:30]  guys are until when i'm on the phone apparently yes okay well you're on the phone you're on the air  yeah go carlos that's what i wanted to say yes yeah that i was uh i was there at um califax um when  like not when they switched over but before they switched over yeah and just like the whole feeling  of the whole matter was so like sad and like i was like hanging around like with everyone who was 
[00:28:00]  getting fired and like it makes me feel bad for radio well that's part of radio well when they flip  and you you leave and you realize you'll never see people again well there's an old saying you're not  really in radio until you've been fired the old the old jocks love to say that one to the newcomers  yeah it is sad because you know those shows were doing well in their demos but they just couldn't  sell it so so they had to try something different carlos yeah and i'm sure they're going to do the 
[00:28:30]  exact same thing to this station because no one's talking and it's like okay if we were valuable to  the company and and their and their future i think they would like calm us down a little bit instead  of having us wonder day after day after day i thought they tried like they did they open the  window and they put a plank to sit here for your walk to xm well like my my my one question is like  is talk radio isn't that the the one viable source of like content as opposed to music where have you 
[00:29:00]  been frankie blue well you know carlos um in the midst of your blackout you raised an interesting  point about talk radio being content original yes you're right yeah you know um i i i believe in  that whole fm talk thing maybe you come up with a better name but i i think radio in general always 
[00:29:30]  just i'm gonna hang up on you carlos thank you for that i think radio just continues to miss the boat  yeah like with everything going on in this world right now i mean you watch cnn for 10 minutes  and you feel like the the world's gonna end any day yeah and it's a perfect time to actually talk  about stuff but radio will miss the boat again and instead of maybe understanding that this is a  perfect time to get some some young talk shows on the air they're gonna blow off all content producing 
[00:30:00]  radio shows and go with like an ipod format they just always miss it's the cheaper of the uh two  so right it's easier to just and i'm talking about radio in general i'm not even talking about this  company because it's happening all over the place they're getting rid of people that have things to  say yeah so i don't understand it's all advertiser based all you know everybody knows that it's like  based on when they can't sell it it's because the advertisers won't buy it because they're afraid of the 
[00:30:30]  content right um and it's like with with kellogg's deal with michael phelps its companies are just so  terrified i don't i can understand if you know you know if david duke has a radio show and you  don't want to advertise all right where is this what's that w uh kln  but i i can't understand this fear they have like there's somebody on this show or whether it's  corolla show or like it's whoever it is is going to say something naughty and the people are going 
[00:31:00]  to go we don't like what you said we're not going to use charman bath tissue it just doesn't make  sense to me yeah the way advertisers run away like that's all you're doing is telling people about a  product yeah mcdonald's is not saying that they agree or any company with what we say or don't agree  with what we say they're just going hey look you listen opian anthony have a burger yeah  that's not a bad thing to say i'm a burger nice now okay thing to say yeah yeah 
[00:31:30]  yeah i i i don't get it i don't know they say the writing's on the wall but there's  apparently nothing on the wall so here so i don't know what to think  wow like i you know uh we uh whatever well i have my theories as to why they're not going to  do it but well i think that a rock station here is uh i don't think you just want to give the other 
[00:32:00]  rock station a boost for what well we have a 50 50 chance 50 it's either going to be this station  or the other station that's pretty obvious at this point be funny they flipped 10 10 wins  and made it all gay news all day long that was the big flip everybody it was the same station  but everybody had to talk in a swish accent all right let's say how to tom in chicago they hated  it uh going to the windy city yes tom hey uh hey you guys noticed last night it just seemed like the  uh like the stage was really small and everyone was like packed on top of each other that was so 
[00:32:30]  calculated like hollywood is like trying to show like you know it's the economy's falling apart so we  have to like downplay the oh is that what they were doing the glitter of the oscars man tame it down  a little they so tamed it down a little bit you know what the heck was with philip seymour hoffman  wearing a stupid do-rag thing did he have the hair follicles i think he got the hair plugs maybe he  got follicles hair plugs right like you know they're not hair plugs stop it they're follicles  individual follicles taken from the harvest area was he wearing a do-rag he uh he's been wearing a 
[00:33:00]  sorry no i actually interrupted you that time go ahead tom  do you see tyler perry on larry king live no i know you guys love tyler perry so i figure the  audio probably's got to be pretty good with uh 40 yeah we'll take a look at that 41 million for uh  madeea goes to jail number one movie at the box office i like it though because even though the  movie i probably wouldn't enjoy that much i like the idea that it's not it's it's uh different than 
[00:33:30]  than a steve white movie or a lot of these other is it different or is it just another here's another  guy dressed as a black woman being sassy well he created his own thing i'm saying his own thing  now isn't that the same thing uh martin did isn't it the same thing uh eddie murphy did i mean  yeah they put on women's clothing and now this this madeea movie you do realize to be the number  one movie at the box office that whitey had to go to the movie right no not missus celery 
[00:34:00]  whitey had to help those numbers no they said um older women were the big audience for this uh  movie like older older women not old women not like old fogey ladies but what like 20 to 24  demo yeah upper demo women were going to see this movie that's who went to see it yeah because  they just love it oh look at that madeea uh-huh what was number two at the box office i always like  seeing what was number two um i think it was gladiator over my house really oh you're taking 
[00:34:30]  box office receipts now yes now i'm taking box office receipts yeah you should have seen some of  the great racist uh scenarios that were being played out in my in my theater things that we didn't have  to put up with in a movie theater because it's in my house so we were all joking about it oh really  and and and doing little little scenarios of what it's like to be in a real movie theater with the  cell phone going off other people threatening you with your life how is the uh thing uh how's this 
[00:35:00]  is oh it's amazing i love it we'll get to that in a second because uh we're heading toward a break  and i don't want to like cut you off because i do want to hear about the new theater man but this is  going to drive jimmy nuts once again taken does very well the box office they're loving this movie  well they also uh although people uh wrote me and they said jimmy kind of the movie's awesome but  jimmy ruined the uh the girl thing for me when she runs with her silly wrong the movie's not awesome 
[00:35:30]  it's not an awesome film awesome i saw the movie i did too i like the action i like the action the  action itself the storyline was there the story was corny and weak uh it just was meaningless drivel  it was like a jason statham movie which is okay to watch but the action is good but you don't care  about any of it it was dull but the action was a little little unique they did some different  things with this yeah they had a man in soy sauce on his head running around trying to save a retarded 
[00:36:00]  running girl that was unique no one's ever done that before and some good reason and someone's  telling me that there's another version of taken that went international that's a even uh bloodier  and more violent than the one they're showing in the states i don't know if that's true  but uh i i i liked i i definitely liked some of the uh and i'm not an action movie guy for the  most part i really enjoyed the action in this movie well the other the other taking you're just  talking about was uh was done by steve martin and it was called the pink panther series  you know what great action movies to me are are are are some of the old stallone movies 
[00:36:30]  schwarzenegger to me is the best action star ever the terminator is a great action movie yeah this  is crap drivel at least the story the story the terminator story is more believable oh well  i've been this idiot yeah i i can't argue the story i've taken i can't argue that the action  sequences were were really good he brings her really good he brings her a karaoke machine and  the new stepdad gives her a pony and she retard runs over to it it's good good drops she drops what 
[00:37:00]  her father gives her pretty much in the driveway and then retard runs yeah to the new pony where the  the unloving uncaring new dad is there and within 24 hours after the kidnapping within 24 hours he's  over there in the exact same spot hiding under the bench shut up well she was crapola he was  pulling out the uh you know the how she was taken yeah the cia guy having a barbecue with three other  dullards you want to come back on the team what what team what is this well this is supposed to be 
[00:37:30]  charming i've come back for my daughter why'd you leave we don't explain that why does the mother  hate you maybe because i accepted the script that's the only thing i can think of we don't explain that  either yeah yeah but he was making some fine burgers for everybody that was the best part of  the movie to me it made me hungry that was a terrible movie i liked it i liked the action  sequence look a lot of people loved it patrice loved it the storyline was yeah i'm i'm sounding like 
[00:38:00]  a broken record but but i like your take on it with the dumb barbecue just three pals getting  together but that's supposed to like add depth to him as a character telling you things in a quick  period without going through his whole but i didn't care about any of it was just not believable to me  oh the uh extended uncut version will be on dvd march 3rd for everybody look at that a little more uh  rough enough of uh some innocent people oh cool maybe that's where the story is going with the  storyline though that jimmy uh is doing a fine job with what drove me nuts about taken was the 
[00:38:30]  whole pop star angle and you know the britney spears character and then at the end of the movie  because of things that went on britney spears pop star owed liam neeson's character a little favor  so liam neeson brings the daughter over to meet the britney spears character yeah and we we're all  educated enough to know that britney spears character would not be just living in a house where  anyone could drive by the house and park in front of her house because that's the only spot left in  the neighborhood yeah but she would be in a gated community especially after what happened to her 
[00:39:00]  backstage at the uh the show where liam neeson basically saved her life it was like she just  opens the door and there's just joe public walking around outside her house oh hi right and he was  trying to bring his daughter to have her like learn the ropes to sing and that it was like a character  trait you i couldn't have cared less her daughter could have enjoyed making hats out of hay and that  would have been as interesting to me in the story as that nonsensical pipe dream she had 
[00:39:30]  that retard runner but i think they even knew that the storyline was weak because they they  little story lots of action a little more story right back to the action they were never far from  the action part of that movie slumdog millionaire here's an example sorry i was just watching the  is that the opening to the uh yes the gay oscars apparently god the low budget uh oscars yeah  we get it low budget because times are tough yeah right hollywood we get it at least spielberg was 
[00:40:00]  dignified he wasn't irritating it was you know he always comes off good yeah yeah i gotta tell you  like uh ron howard who i'm named after yeah because i looked like uh that little that little fellow  that he played way back little op back in uh his hair loss is horrific wow  there's not and i love this guy his harvest area to match up that world of herd up top but if you  like dumped like if you dumped chemo on your head and just started pulling your hair out willy-nilly  you couldn't look like ron howard what's going on on the top of his head there's no pattern 
[00:40:30]  whatsoever to his baldness he's got yeah male no pattern baldness it is horrific male random baldness  oh i wish they'd show him it could be the worst hair loss i've ever seen maybe someone will come  up with a better example but we'll come back i'm sorry i was just gonna say that is the furthest  thing from richie cunningham like you can't even pick him it's a totally different entity now  uh than the old richie cunningham dude he couldn't have been nicer man i i mean i told the story a while 
[00:41:00]  ago but i met him on uh columbus avenue and i want a picture with him and stuff and he sat there and  talked to me for like 15 minutes i'm like why are you talking to me you're like you're getting you're  like this massive director in hollywood you all you had to do is snap your picture and tell me to beat  it but he could have been nicer this guy thank god for him he went into directing and became so  successful what else was he gonna do well just that's what i mean play a monster a zombie movie like 
[00:41:30]  like like like being potsy right you know he could have just been another potsy weber uh he went  into directing became uh unbelievably successful because he he lost everything that got him into  uh tv and movies yeah which was i guess his looks but uh wow that hair it's just it he's got a head  like uh frankenstein in young frankenstein he's got peter boyle head  he's like peter boyle now that's great all right we gotta take him right and we get back we hear 
[00:42:00]  the sean penn yeah we're supposed to play it here we'll play it after the break certainly sean penn did  a pretty good job because i think he knows everyone in hollywood is like that's great look we'll do a  little split screen that's pretty close the same head look they got that same like ridge above the  eyebrows and everything yeah oh opie what happened to and then we got a white guy that loved medea but 
[00:42:30]  he hung up really these people they can't hold on today there's some of these people ran out a lot  of people having some good observations and then they're just hanging up on us the jennifer aniston's  uh thing i know you guys the pop culture thing is whatever but she came out on stage with  jack black who takes me out of every effing movie that guy's good dude shut it he's food clam it  he's good no he's not makes me laugh he's quirky he's crazy what's he gonna do next but she stammered  her way through what she was doing for the oscars because she's 20 feet away from the the power couple 
[00:43:00]  oh right she's got you could tell that she was like oh my god they're right in front of me  she's looking at uh they're right in front of me yeah yeah she looked really distracted and she  was stammering do you know how funny it would have been of course she wouldn't do this because  why would an actor have anything interesting for real to say exact same thing if she would have said  uh i know what you're gonna say something just some off the cover mark about what an excellent  seating choice yeah some something that addressed it yes yeah because it was obvious and laughed and 
[00:43:30]  then of course they had to like uh get some shots of angelina kind of laughing and reacting to what  they were doing on stage it was so calculated but you're right she should have acknowledged like  wow this is awkward how about hey congratulations angelina you did pretty good look what i wound up  with what a great slam of jack black that would you know what a great laugh that would have gotten  yeah god forbid yeah and then jack black would have tried to make it about him and ruin everything  he would have done some kind of crazy chris farley move you know what this guy get out of here 
[00:44:00]  he can't be controlled i used to love jack black too i used to like the guy yeah and then he takes me  out of these movies now man he was good in kong though um shut up  opie and anthony talking about the oscars like everyone else uh we'll take your phone calls 877-212-0&a  i do want to thank um ron and fez ron and fez i want to thank them for giving me the worst 
[00:44:30]  sugar headache i've ever had in my life thank you boys unlike us they eat like men over there  on the ron and fez show we we debate with kenny about fat content and cholesterol  oh give me some blueberries and a little like your fat free yogurt those guys eat like men  at one point uh ronnie ate something and he goes oh boy that one stabbed me right in the heart 
[00:45:00]  it was just a cholesterol ridden sandwich he was eating and he looks at everyone goes oh no  that one stabbed me right in the heart and then they broke out the sugar products yeah we don't have  sugar products on the open air they love their sweets on the ron and fez show they uh they had  a banana pudding that was ridiculous ridiculous and then i had probably the tastiest thing i've ever  had in my life this is uh some kind of cream puff thing oh filled with like uh that that that cream 
[00:45:30]  that creamy goodness oh creamy goodness and i woke up with this horrendous sugar headache yeah  i call it a sugar headache right here thud thud thud it's just thudding away on the left side of my  uh skull i woke up with a bit of a sugar headache too from the wine yeah yeah yeah it's gotta be the

[00:51:30]  yeah the kiss the ass of the nominees former oscar winners actors came out and instead of them just  showing a clip of the uh best actor nominees um they talked about them and their role instead of  showing a clip right which is kind of odd but uh and it went on and on forever and ever and uh you  know then they open up the envelope yeah this is de niro uh talking about sean penn how did he do it 
[00:52:00]  how for so many years did sean penn get all those jobs playing straight men  anyone else notice that sean penn hasn't completely gotten rid of the harvey milk  yeah he still sounds a little bit like harvey milk he gets into his characters it takes him a while to  get uh get the characters out of him how into the character was he well he was i mean you hear things 
[00:52:30]  you do hear things about what these guys will do to get into their into the role with his uh little  spanish friend opie all i saw is him nude laying on a mattress playfully just playfully spanking each  other's bottoms bare bottoms oh you know these guys like these guys like to gain a lot of weight or  lose a lot of weight for a role yeah you know if you're gonna play harvey milk how how much research  are you doing that shot before he would have had to lose weight for the role he's got that beautiful 
[00:53:00]  wife of his that robin right penn who's probably the the hottest thing yeah this wow yeah digging her  i don't put a picture up i've always liked her yeah oh my god and she she ate she's aging very well  unlike a lot of these stars she yeah i think so but imagine uh sean penn is like look i gotta do this  for the role yeah trying to explain to his wife why he has to do certain things uh denaro kisses 
[00:53:30]  sean penn's ass being a movie star can get in the way of acting but not for sean sean penn the actor  loses himself in every role so we can discover a man named sand mystic rivers jimmy markham the surfer  dude spicoli a dead dead man walkway that's a little weird because uh penn doesn't want to  acknowledge he ever did spicoli i don't know if he ever outright said he doesn't want to acknowledge  it but the the weird thing is that got kind of a reaction like people want him to acknowledge that 
[00:54:00]  he did it it's a character that everyone knows right likes the character right he uh he he didn't i  guess want to be stereotyped as that but i think enough time has gone by you're not going to be  typecast this picoli there you're you're safe don't worry about it all us fast times ridgemont high  fans we're just hoping that he would just show a sense of humor and go up there as picoli imagine  if he just did an all-out picoli to accept the award you know just the opening line the opening line 
[00:54:30]  yeah yeah give us a couple seconds totally awesome and you know i'm gonna wing on over and jam  with the stills and de niro's talking about being a movie star doesn't get in the way of acting for a  lot of for you it does for de niro it has yeah you you take these horrible roles yeah oh he should  look at sean penn and then shoot himself for what sean penn's been doing as a movie star what he has  done in the last 15 years hey but look who he's working with yeah i thought they were going to bring 
[00:55:00]  him out uh during that whole thing where they had the old uh uh old in the new or whatever yeah  come up but uh oh god i would have loved that see his lifts they didn't because they didn't want to  stand him on the stage with other people yes maybe bobby d can carry me in his pocket  continued success  it's great my dying words something you say when you get a gold watch when you retire 
[00:55:30]  i got little shoes a little lift  they got to tie the yellow pages and i'll shuffle out hand out the oscar  i strapped two oscars to my feet give me a couple inches  why is uh hey hey get that op guy that ron howard over here i could uh you interested in a way  here's more matches your hair color better than mine 
[00:56:00]  i look like the host from slumdog millonair millonair  de nero kissing sean penn's yeah i backed it up a bit so  being a movie star can get in the way of acting but not for sean sean penn the actor loses himself in  every role so we can discover a man named sam mystic rivers jimmy markham the surfer dude spicoli 
[00:56:30]  a dead dead man walking and harvey milk sean brings the  same commitment to his off-screen life  you see it when he campaigns for human rights respectfully advises worldly leaders and gently  keep watching that for one second he can't freaking read this dummy cannot deliver a joke  he's horrible he can't deliver 
[00:57:00]  that concept where the pauses go that whole thing was a joke yeah like he's not he doesn't  like it's supposed to be a goof on sean penn that part of it but you think he's because he's just  rambling on like he was the whole time it's just part of uh him talking about sean penn it's a joke  well he's he's joking when he says uh he very gently advises for advises foreign lead leaders  nothing wrecks a punchline yeah like like stutter stepping to it but whoever wrote that for him should 
[00:57:30]  have had parentheses and go though they will laugh here yeah parentheses he would have read it  semi-circle laughs other semi-circle l-o-l  what i'm about to read is in brackets  could you listen to him trip again please this guy yeah it's it's just great somewhere around here  hollywood royalty the boob he's a total moats  sean brings the same commitment to his off-screen life you see it when he campaigns for human rights 
[00:58:00]  respectfully advises world leaders and gently gently reasons with the paparazzi  tonight it's important to be a great actor in life it's more important to be a great human being  that's my friend sean penn  friend yeah i guess they know each other from all right what was the movie we're no angels was  that the movie they did together oh yeah yeah but they both played priests oh wow it was the proverbial

[01:03:00]  baptist church there was somebody probably holding up these gay marriage signs probably yeah a bunch  of gay marriage anti-gay gay gay gay things gay we want less government it's a good time for those  who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and  the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support we've got to have  equal rights for everyone 
[01:03:30]  yeah oh well yeah i mean this is exactly what you expect that's what he does this is what we  expected of him right imagine if he just got up there and there's a whole bunch of fact  wow just seeing everyone's mouth agape like what is he doing it was very hard for me to play  that role considering my hatred of gay people right watch sean penn is what what are you doing sean  a homophobic and the true hero of the movie josh brolin oh gosh why don't you come up here and take a 
[01:04:00]  bow yeah and there are these last two things um i um i'm very very proud to to live in a country that is  willing to elect an elect elect an elegant man president and a country and a country who for  all its toughness creates courageous artists and this is in great due respect to all the nominees 
[01:04:30]  but creators of courageous artists  who despite a sensitivity that sometimes has brought enormous challenge mickey rourke rises again  and he is my brother  that's that's why the oscars by the way are irrelevant  just this this drippy  nonsense we're brave what's brave about you what you do i mean it's not easy what he does but 
[01:05:00]  a nation that raves how about brave soldiers or cops you fruit shut up  well you well your whole job is to pretend you're someone else yeah  god almighty and he's great at it but shut your mouth very good  what i love about this brave what i love about this too is sean penn spent the last year talking about  you know gay rights gay marriage blah blah blah blah blah starting today he completely forgets that  cause yep i love when that happens with these actors and actresses it's important now because 
[01:05:30]  they're you know trying to get that oscar now he's gotten the oscar now he moves on to the next role  and forgets about the whole gay issue be great if they hired him to play a klansman and he won the  oscar and he's like and the problem is you jews and spooks have to leave the white man alone  he just gets into every role right just what's this oh david here's the david and bobo show  a little taste for everybody five is good five is the best five is the best oh all right very 
[01:06:00]  good all right we'll get to that in a second here the david and bobo show trust me it's it's  worth listening to is it even for the people that really don't like david on our show david  in small doses like this it works remember that nyu protest yeah an update on that very edgy crazy  radical students and uh yeah i was reading up on that over the weekend and uh i don't know what  they were protesting i still don't know they want answers open they want disclosure of what the 
[01:06:30]  teachers are making man budget cuts budget they're all upset about the budget cuts and they wanted  uh scholarships for students from gaza yeah because they're mad at israel oh yeah  did they have a protest have your parents spark over the cash for them them  you're a little you're a little rich bastard yeah how about this you little snot how about you give  up your uh instead of your parents wasting money on your tuition how about they send it to gaza shut up  what they were like in the cafeteria and they were getting vegan wraps and girls were topless on the 
[01:07:00]  street and vegan wraps mad and the police were pushing back the barricades but i you just explained  it and i still don't know why would anyone take up that cause for real i just love how every car  driving through the wall of a convenience store uh over the security camera looks exactly the same they  could just play one of these it looks exactly the same some dope why is this flying through and 
[01:07:30]  chips end up flying all over the place why is it such a epidemic by the way i don't know it's  happening a lot lately old people that can't drive god they just step on the guy i thought it was the  break what those people wonderful all right so the nyu protest is over and you get to listen to  snotty kids uh now that's what that's why we're playing this man right it was not the end the 
[01:08:00]  group take back nyu was hoping for school that's their name take back nyu shut up back from who from  who not the end they were hoping for i bet you know what when i was growing up i dreamed of going to a  fine university like nyu right oh my god i would have just shut my mouth go to class and i would have  been happy i was there learning make a film instead of going to uh no offense because it's changed over 
[01:08:30]  the years but my alma mater geneseo which was voted one of the top drinking schools in the entire world  when i was there that's good playboy magazine that's wonderful i i enjoy the party and trust me but you  know i like to learn something too  i wouldn't have been bitching i would have been like very happy to be there yeah getting my learn  on but they're taking back nyu get my learn on they're taking back nyu but i guess they didn't 
[01:09:00]  take it back they borrowed it it was not the end the group take back nyu was hoping for school  security storming the cafeteria a chaotic end to the two-day sit-in organized by farah kimji  i am incredibly disgusted incredibly disgusted and enraged at the way that nyu administration  has handled this when it was all over farah and the others were taken from the building suspended  and forced to leave their dorms the negotiators told them they were going to be suspended that's 
[01:09:30]  hilarious i hope they're kicked out of school yeah i'd love that they have to go back and uh live  with mommy and daddy these dummies get some mundane job these idiots don't realize school is in a  democracy and i remember in high school you'd always have these wise ass little douches thinking  that they were gonna have us we're just gonna have a sit-in or something so we can get smoking in the  school yeah we want permission to smoke in the school meanwhile the dummy kids don't even realize 
[01:10:00]  things about fire insurance and and liability and the reason that the school doesn't have smoking  they don't care about your lungs they care about their uh their pocketbook yeah and uh you ever do  a walkout though they think it's gonna i did plenty of walkouts because i didn't want to be in school  right it had nothing to do with a cause oh there's gonna be a walkout today i'm in i don't care what  it's for i'm just walking out i remember sitting in classes like okay at two o'clock we're all just  gonna leave class and get up and walk out man and my little little little body that hasn't changed 
[01:10:30]  yet is sitting there getting all nervous oh god it's almost almost time i might get in trouble  with it could get suspended mom and dad and then you walk out of school and you stand on the front  lawn and then you look around like all right now what yeah now what then then it's time to pick like a  delegation that is supposed to go in and speak with somebody in charge like the principal or  something so you pick a delegation of douches that then go inside and try to give their side of this 
[01:11:00]  argument yeah and meanwhile it's a complete waste of time because again it's not a democracy no it  doesn't work like that they they sit there they listen they go they go no now get back to class  you're suspended we have the freedom man we have a right to tell our side it's school  get back to class and you're out real and get a real cause shut up yeah a lot of things you could  be uh yelling and screaming about back nyu from from what but the children did little children the 
[01:11:30]  spoiled little children want to barricade over a cafeteria so first of all they shouldn't be given  food they should be able to bring food in if they want yeah but why should they give you vegan wraps  you little fruit and so security booted them out said get out and they're outraged because there's such  they're so used to being cuddled oh yeah the way they handled this what coming in and saying get  out of here get out where the security for the place uh leave wait to hear the next cliff farra says 
[01:12:00]  it didn't have to come to this and when she tells her parents what happened they're gonna be furious that  i was physically like thrown through the door onto the ground by three to four guys like this big  although the university doesn't quite see it like that it has it has ended peacefully the students  are collecting their belongings now will they all be suspended they will all be suspended that means  they will be in a regular university process which allows for appeal what about their demands then  none of their demands were exceeded to good beat it kids yeah dummies parents gonna be mad 
[01:12:30]  there are people that would love to go to that school oh my god love it oh my god they would love  to go to that school and and just go not make trouble just get your goddamn diploma learn something  about filmmaking maybe but then these bored idiots decide they have to have some cause because we're in 
[01:13:00]  college man you know the 60s they change things we can do the same shut up you cannot  you're right they're little tools aren't they oh they certainly are yeah in the 60s they went to  the college campuses and shot the kids too yeah good one jimmy consider yourself lucky coins they just  they just threw you on you threw you on your uh heinies there and uh yeah and that's the end of it 
[01:13:30]  back in the day back in the day they would shoot you yeah speaking of college and people who will  never go there bob kelly's coming in at nine o'clock on the uh yeah bob's on the sex side oh bob how did  he do on his f-8s i wish that joke would have worked when he was fat it would have bob on his f-8s scored a  three-twenty nice also incidentally the same as his s-a-t's a blithering idiot 
[01:14:00]  a fool i like when bobby comes in he's a blithering idiot as he is it'll be good um  oscars so i don't know i guess that's it with the oscars right maybe we'll get you a couple more  observations uh the david and bobo show you want to hear a little i sure do after uh our show friday  we had a little extra time and we gave uh intern david 15 minutes to do a radio show with bobo 
[01:14:30]  who's also uh daniel from uh somewhere in queens i believe he's a mets fan big mets fan we love this  kid he's uh he's a he's a little odd yeah but uh you know harmless yeah uh funny loves the show yeah  and um you know he's kind of we've taken him under our wing a bit we sure have probably 12 gauge in  the back of someone's head while she sleeps we sure have so this is the david and bobo show just a  little taste yeah this is the first ever edition of the show and i want to get to know you a little 
[01:15:00]  bit so first of all you're bobo what gave you the name bobo if i may ask my sister's been calling me  that since she was a baby and it just stuck with me she still calls it she still calls me that to this  day well why does she call you bobo i mean she could have picked like face or she could be like  clown or whatever like why does she call you bobo where does that come from i don't know when she  was little that's how she said brother should brother means bobo how does that work i i have  no idea if i could if i could figure out baby language i'd be a freaking genius yeah do you consider 
[01:15:30]  yourself a genius there bobo well i don't know i don't know a genius but if i freaking knew that  language i'd be a freaking genius what language do you know bobo yeah the only language i can speak  it's english you can't speak any other languages no what about bobo language that's the same as  english oh that's the same as english yeah it is unlistenable no i would listen to this for hours  i meant yeah unlistenable and completely listenable david look at he's over there he feels bad that's 
[01:16:00]  all right he could stay right there oh no he certainly looks uh he looks a little dejected with  his first outing on the air why you did good you just didn't say bobo enough nobody knew the guy's  name yeah all right hold on man we got professor lou on the line hey lou what a wet blanket lou is  how you doing boys are you really a teacher at nyu i teach in the ministry department all 
[01:16:30]  right all right what do you got on this protest that we still uh still don't understand  it they were treating this thing like it was an occupation by a military force they were having  secure meetings they were meeting with them what uh the mypd talking about how we got to get  everything secure man if they find out our secret they were acting like they have state secrets hidden  in secret departments guarded by secret agents it was absolutely ridiculous and we weren't allowed  to use our emails because they were afraid we were going to get infiltrated oh my god are you kidding 
[01:17:00]  wait wait the students you mean or the school the students were allowed to use their email and the  professors certainly weren't because the students email us don't you understand they're coming hey  professor lou were you scared were you scared for your life i was so terrified i actually took up all  my hot students offers to do anything for an a lou lou these these crazy radicals i mean they just will  stop at nothing i understand they put chairs up and they uh they ate some vegan wraps it got ugly 
[01:17:30]  go you know the worst stuff isn't making it into the news because the mainstream media doesn't  report it you know these people were sleeping on the floor that's how dedicated they were to the cause  wow oh my god i hear al-qaeda's reporting simply because they are that dedicated  a bunch of little pussies boy her parents are going to be mad what else is going to happen oh my  with the repercussions will be endless there's a possibility that we may have to start walking around 
[01:18:00]  with little tags around our neck so they can monitor our activities so we stay safe and secure at all  times they just want to be part of something big and important and they they look at like their  parents or even grandparents in some instances where they they were during the vietnam war protesting and  and it's all looked at through rose-colored lenses right now but the fact of the matter is there  there were a hell of a lot of i guess lame-ass protests back in the 60s also and a few of 
[01:18:30]  them made the news and uh we changed a generation man and now they're bored they want to do the same  thing and it just doesn't work stop it already the uh all the uh other students were looking at  him like uh you're trying to ruin this for us we're trying to learn here yeah and you're completely  inhibiting the process thank you for letting us spend seven thousand dollars to watch you sit  and eat a green wrap why hey lou why would they bring them anything why wouldn't they just say 
[01:19:00]  here's a ham and swiss eat it or or just eat your own socks you little creep i wouldn't give them  anything because nyu is owned by mature people and they're so mature they're willing to help their  enemies you know turn the other cheek and all that crap here have a sandwich on us while you're  occupying student center please let us look like bigger douchebags than we already probably would  have been sued for like not feeding them yeah by somebody get away with the next prisons if you  want food your family has to bring it to you all right thank you professor lou thanks i'll see you 
[01:19:30]  all right okay okay i love doing the low along with you all right here's more david and bobo  so what did you have a pretty good relationship there with your sister back in the day and she's  all she's only she's only 13 so she's younger than you yeah she's younger than me all all right  so how did she what made her to start calling you bobo is that you couldn't mention any other name  like why that name i as i said before i have no idea that's how that's how she said brother 
[01:20:00]  all right i got you so do you hang out with your sister a lot you you you you too close  night i see i see her every so often she's she's she's going out a lot i don't know  it's enough about the robo yeah  it's just he he doesn't know how to have a conversation no not at all and then it uh continued  with this caller the callers you didn't get any of the other callers like i think brooklyn ace called 
[01:20:30]  and he was hilarious track three right there oh i thought that was fun was that the preceded  call yeah yeah no no no that's coming god was that funny yeah that that was definitely really funny  yeah are you going out what are you going to do this week that's what i get to it's the weekend  coming up you know bobo so what are you going to do this weekend got any big plans man what are you  going to do what's your typical weekend bobo what you're going to do this weekend what's wrong jimmy  what's wrong some i i a little observation david when you're asking a question at one point you

[01:22:30]  a bunch of questions you got a problem with that why don't you come around and run the show if you  got a problem i could do a hell of a lot better job than you could david you think you could  anyone could neo could neo or whatever forget you goodbye forget you goodbye forget your bye  just unbelievable when i was listening to this i'm like oh my god he really doesn't have any  any radio on-air talent whatsoever oh i don't know bobo i think you should give him uh another

Pshw, pshw, pshw.  I just realized I had bedbugs for years in my parents' house.  What are you talking about?  You saw those things?  Ah, no way.  I thought you could only see them under a microscope.  No, no.  Bedbugs, you could see.  I thought they were beetles.  They would be crawling on the floor because I would have all this stuff laying on my floor. 
[01:29:30]  They would have little pudding heads under their hats.  Little one-legged other bug wives.  No, I would see them on my bed once in a while.  I thought I would get them in the summer.  I thought they were summer beetles.  Summer beetles.  I swear to God.  They're bedbugs.  Dude, I had bedbugs for years.  Good for you, but Danny and I are looking at our favorite traffic chick.  Oh, wow.  What's her name?  Old Tiny Head?  Oh, my God.  God almighty.  What is she, piss?  A witch doctor?  She has a small head.  I don't think it's said she has a small head. 
[01:30:00]  She just has giant glasses.  Her rack is huge.  Oh, my God.  Her rack is huge.  Everything.  Her head is too small.  Channel 5's local Fox affiliate there, the traffic girl over there.  Miss Connecticut.  What?  Yeah, she's a former Miss Connecticut.  She gets thrown out for posing nude.  She's 26.  Hope Travis gets a hold of her.  All right.  Not you.  She's got those male versions.  Me and Danny have been all over this one for a while.  Dude, she's looking real good. 
[01:30:30]  Today, she's got the right...  I mean, it depends on what she wears because...  Yeah.  Travis made a good point, too.  He's like, they totally know what they're doing.  It's like, whoever has a full-frame shot of their traffic girl in a sexy red dress?  She's hippie, but she's got these big, heavy, freaking giant things.  Does she have a penchant for burning other girls' clothing?  Well...  She should stand there with a funhouse mirror to make her head look larger.  Look at her tiny, shrunken head.  Someone threw her head in an oven and shrunk it. 
[01:31:00]  It bothers me.  And it's not just her rack being huge.  Oh, my God.  Because her body is very proportioned, except for her tiny head.  That's her?  Why do you have to ruin everything?  Any better pictures?  We're enjoying it.  Her name's Melissa Mandak.  M-A-N-D-A-K.  She used to be a blonde.  On TV, she's a brunette.  Dark brunette.  Yeah.  Make it official.  Put our new traffic girl on that TV.  That's it.  That's it.  It's over.  It's over, Jotty.  Put it on that TV.  Make it official.  We got a new traffic girl to stare at. 
[01:31:30]  That's it.  And it's...  There you go.  Officially, we have made the change.  Slid that one over.  Oh, we did slide it over, man.  Wow, wow, wow.  I'm going to capture that image.  I'm going to tweet the S out of that.  If Mick Foley knows her, I'm going home that day.  I like to give her a little kiss on the tiny cheek.  Do you really think her head's kind of small?  Why is it too small?  Oh, come on.  Dude, it's a thumb.  What do you think, Bobo? 
[01:32:00]  What do you think, Bobo?  Bobo, do you think her head's too small?  Bobo, what do you think about that with the head this small?  He gets lost in his own question.  He just unravels completely.  Maybe she works like a balloon, and if you squeeze those, her head blows up a little  bigger.  She just shut down the show.  But she's a beautiful girl.  She's a beautiful girl.  Beautiful girls.  Kit Kat Club.  Yeah.  Show me how you shrink a skull.  Show me what you witch doctor, kid.  How you shrink a skull. 
[01:32:30]  Witch doctor.  Oh, wait until you see her tight.  The thinner guy touched her face.  Little head.  Little head.  I'd die with it on my lips.  Will you be quiet?  What if I have a shot with this one?  Yeah, come on.  Come on, man.  You might have a shot with her.  Wings out, Bobo?  You think you have a shot with her, Danny?  What do you think, Danny?  Think you got a shot, Danny?  Oh, Danny.  Speaking of, if you have a shot glass, maybe you can give it to her.  She'll wear it as a hat.  Come on.  Why are you going to ruin it? 
[01:33:00]  We're really into this one.  Wow.  I do have to say, it depends what she wears, though.  Someday she's wearing the wrong thing for those heavy boobs.  Yeah.  She probably says, I'm going to go get a haircut.  I'll be back in 35 seconds.  Come on, man.  Oh, my God.  God, oh, my lucky her.  I envy her.  She has a little head.  Wouldn't mind that myself.  Oh, no, stop. 
[01:33:30]  That's great.  She does have a little head.  Of course she does.  I'll give you that.  Teeny, tiny head.  Teeny, tiny head.  Hey, Cajiria head, get over here.  I want to talk to you.  That sucks.  We like this one.  She's beautiful.  All right.  She's beautiful.  She should only film from the neck up or the neck down, but never together.  Yeah, someone's got to cut her head off, not in real life, but on a picture, and then  Photoshop it a little bigger.  Yes.  And then put it back on her head.  Exactly.  She's actually someone that Down syndrome would have helped.  Look at her pictures online. 
[01:34:00]  She's a blonde in these pics.  She should go back to being a blonde, right?  Right, Danny?  Hey, she's looking good no matter what she's doing.  Yeah.  Anybody got a thimble full of hair dye?  Hey, go back to her stats for the people out there.  She's a blonde.  She was Miss Connecticut, you said?  Yep.  5'10".  You had the stats up there.  I don't know what page you were on.  Yeah, she was 5'10".  5'10".  If you cut her head off, she'd be 5'9".  Come on. 
[01:34:30]  Come on.  Tiny head.  All right, whatever.  We'll try to find her stats again.  Google image the crap out of her.  Her name's Melissa Mandak, M-A-N-D-A-K.  We've got to take a break.  Everyone's doing their David impression on instant feedback.  Barbara from the United States.  I can't wait for this Friday, Opie.  Listen, Opie, every day when you're on, Opie, every week, Opie, during the day when you're  on, Opie.  He was so bad at being on the radio. 
[01:35:00]  I love it.  I can't wait for them to do another show.  Every week, we should make them do, like, they have to have a phone topic, and then maybe,  like, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  We'll give them, like, little, like, morning zoo-type bits and see how they do.  David and Bobo in the morning.  So we'll produce their show?  Not really.  Just, and we don't produce our own.  Why would we produce that?  That.  Yes.  Why would we produce that filler?  Black History Month.  We go to break with today's honoree.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic 
[01:35:30]  African-Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor Marvin from the 1994 Quentin Tarantino blockbuster Pulp Fiction.  While his time on screen was brief, his hysterical performance made a lasting impression in our  minds, and in the back of Jules Winfield's car.  Marvin, what do you make of all this?  Man, I don't even have an opinion.  Well, you gotta have an opinion. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, do you think that God came down from heaven and stopped him?  What the fuck's happening?  Oh, shit.  Well, God didn't stop that one, now did he?  Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.  Why the fuck did you do that?  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Should I tell you something that's bugging me, and I could be wrong, so I don't want to  say definitely, but we're talking about Citibank and how they're trying to back out of the 
[01:36:30]  field naming the new Shea Stadium City Field.  Yeah.  It's a $400 million contract, and is it that the Mets won't let them back out?  I understand they want that $400 million, but it's like...  Well, they got the contract, I guess, you know?  But it's a piece of paper.  It's like the economy's in the toilet.  So banks are going under, and the Mets won't let them back out so they can just name their  stupid field?  They want their cash.  But they didn't do anything...  $400 million.  But it's like, for what? 
[01:37:00]  Well, it's a huge revenue stream with these naming of the parks, so they don't want to  lose out on the $400 million.  What a scumbag baseball team.  What they could do is maybe see if there's any other shooters out there and tell Citibank,  well, if we find another suitor to take over this deal, then all right, we'll talk.  But they don't want to lose $400 million.  I understand that.  I hate that they name these parks after banks and stuff, but if that's what's happening...  But Jim, think of it this way.  If you're contracted to work for a company, and then they all of a sudden come to you  and say, you know, we kind of don't want to do this anymore, would you say, well, times 
[01:37:30]  are bad.  Okay, I understand.  Or would you say, hey, pay me my money.  We're on the contract.  No, but the difference is this.  The Mets, first of all, the dumb field hasn't even opened yet.  Second of all, an individual working for a company and trying to pay your bills is different  than a baseball team who is not going to lose money, who has a brand new field.  This is just $400 million extra dollars.  They just want to have more money, which is fine.  They're going to go into buying players, things like that.  Exactly.  Nonsense, which means nothing on the grand scale. 
[01:38:00]  It means nothing in this country.  It's going to be interesting to see what happens to baseball with this economy, by the way.  I think the attendance is going to be down all over the place.  And they're signing players for a lot less money.  All of a sudden, a lot less money.  Well, everybody.  That's good.  That's with everything.  Everyone is getting paid less, except for, you know, some of these executives at some of  these banks that have gotten money.  They get huge bonuses.  I can't wait to see Citi Field. 
[01:38:30]  I won't even call it that.  Shea Stadium.  Oh, I thought you were going to say something else.  They should just...  You're right.  It'll always be...  It's the new Shea Stadium.  Why don't they take the first part of Shea and the second part of Citi and put that together  and have that be the name of the field?  Shady?  No, but you're close.  I know.  I'm with you.  Yeah.  I'm with you.  What do you got on this, Travis?  No, there was an article in the paper, I think, yesterday about Yankees.  Was there?  Yes.  It was about Yankee season ticket holders. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they're pissed.  Yeah.  What's that deal all about?  They're, like, for one example, there was this guy who had season tickets for the weekends  in, like, right behind the visitor's dugout.  And the Yankees decided that, based on his seniority level, he would get bleacher seats  for 14 weekday games, which he can't use.  They just completely changed his package around?  Yeah.  And they're pretty much saying, you know, and for more expensive. 
[01:39:30]  I mean, of course.  So, basically, the deal he had with them is of no value to them.  So, it's amazing how, like, when it works out for them, the deal you have is of no value  and it's meaningless because things change.  But, when it comes to something like this, well, a deal's a deal.  Yeah.  Know what they did to me?  I'm an Islander season ticket holder.  Now.  Give you back all your money for watching that crappy team play?  I sure wish.  I sure wish, Anthony.  Got another draft pick, though.  They give you a goalie stick until you play? 
[01:40:00]  At this point, they just might do that.  But I can't go to all the games, so I want a half a season.  Half season, whole game.  Half season, whole game.  Because, you know, with these hours, you can't go to weekday games and all.  So, sort of like what Travis was saying, if you do the half season, you get a lot of weekend games,  you get a lot of holiday games.  You know what I mean?  Those are good ones to go to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you can't sit in certain seats because those are reserved for people that are buying the whole season. 
[01:40:30]  That's how they get you.  How ridiculous is that?  I want half a season.  I want these freaking seats.  Give them to me.  Just rape you.  So, then the Yankees pretty much don't care.  Because they're emailing these people back saying, look, like, pretty much, if you don't like it, don't take them.  Because we've got a huge waiting list of people who have never had season tickets before.  So, they'll take anything they can get.  Has anyone talked to Costanza about this?  No. 
[01:41:00]  He's busy on those cotton uniforms.  I had a cotton uniform.  That ain't pretty good.  My beauty.  We've got more info, Jimmy, for you.  This might be the problem right here.  Patrick in Oakdale.  Yeah, Jimmy, the Citibank logo is all over the place already on the stadium.  So, they would have to take all that stuff out.  Well, that's Citibank.  You have to pay for it.  I mean, the Mets should not incur a loss at all.  But every seat has a little logo on it that says Citi Field.  Oh, boy.  Oh, does it really?  Oh, okay.  A little too late now. 
[01:41:30]  How cheesy.  They all deserve to take a loss.  The new stadium should just collapse on opening day, and all the fans should be killed, and  then Citibank should go under.  And then you'll hear one heel-clicking little lad.  It'll be old Jimmy Norton.  Stadiums used to have a personality and cool names, and now it's like Citi Field.  What about the Cow Powers?  Huh?  Yeah.  They had nice names.  Well, the stadiums are looking a lot nicer. 
[01:42:00]  They kind of are giving them a retro look.  You can't say that Citi Field doesn't look better than Shea.  Oh, well.  Shea was just a big blue toilet bowl.  It looks fantastic.  It looks horrible.  Citi Field definitely looks fantastic.  Yeah.  It's looking good.  It's looking good.  Oh, let's say hi to Dennis on Long Island.  Talking sports on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello?  Hey.  What's up, Dennis?  What's going on, guys?  Yeah, me and my brother have season tickets for the Mets. 
[01:42:30]  We had a Saturday and a Sunday, and for this season coming up at Citi Field, I was offered  on a Wednesday starting at 9 o'clock, the last day possible.  So I'm talking to a guy on the phone.  He goes, I have two sections left.  Either all the way upstairs in one section, or you could be a left field spectator.  Oof.  And these are season ticket holders.  Exactly.  And not to mention, for the past two seasons, I've bought playoff tickets, were more than  well $900 apiece for two seats. 
[01:43:00]  Both years, they didn't make it.  And last season, they didn't even offer me to give my money back.  I had to get tickets for this season.  Why would they?  Why would you go, dude?  Why would you sit there?  And why?  Just watch it on TV.  You know what?  Jimmy, you know what?  You're right.  But it's something to do.  It's a great time.  My brother and I, we go.  We have a couple cocktails.  We barbecue.  It's a great time.  But you know what?  It's getting to be out of control.  I mean, the Yankees, they have the same problem. 
[01:43:30]  They can't even sell bonds to finish their stadium.  And the Mets, they should just change Citi Field, make a chase stadium, bring it back  to the fans.  It's unfair.  I mean, I'm trying to get opening day tickets.  But I had to put it for the draft like everybody else.  You know, I just wanted to work out for us just once.  You know, if your team starts doing really well, what do they do?  They hike up the prices big time the following year.  Well, when your team is as awful as, let's say, the Islanders, worst team in hockey right  now, they should now turn it around and give you some savings. 
[01:44:00]  Never.  But it never works out in your favor.  They're always screwing you and coming up with excuses why they have to raise the prices.  But then when that same team sucks a big one, you still have to pay the ridiculous prices  to sit there and try to support the team.  And I do.  I understand the enjoyment of going.  Me and Mike went to like the third to the last game.  And believe me, I wish the turnout was the same for him at the end.  Stupid stump brain in a rowboat slumped over catching a bass. 
[01:44:30]  Bolt in the head.  You can say a Hail Mary, dumbbell.  But we had fun.  I mean, we ate a, you know, at a cheesesteak.  You know, you eat like a pig.  You drink a soda.  It was a fun time.  I get it.  But it's just the teams.  Look, the teams to me have so little regard for people, regular people.  They don't care at all.  That's a big grade.  The sad part about it is that we went to a game one day.  My brother and I bought six beers, three apiece, and two heroes. 
[01:45:00]  And it was almost $200.  You bought Sully and who else?  It was out of control.  It was almost $200.  Come on.  Apparently, this, I'm reading the guy here on PalTalk, pays $1,170 for season tickets to the Pats games.  Yeah.  And $40 a game to park.  Oh, yeah.  How do you justify $40 to park?  They're parking Tom Brady's locker.  Dude, every... 
[01:45:30]  It makes no sense.  Every time I pull up to the Coliseum and have to pay for parking, it drives me nuts.  And they're doing this, obviously, with every sporting event, like you mentioned, and rock concerts and all that.  I got a ticket.  It says, Islanders Rangers.  Yeah.  I got it.  I bought a ticket to see an event at your building.  And I still got to pay extra money to park now.  So my car...  How did they get that done?  And how did they get...  Hang out with other cars.  But how did they get that past us?  You would assume, like, if you're buying a ticket for an event, that the parking should obviously be included. 
[01:46:00]  You're going to their arena.  Brilliant.  And the politicians knew this was going on and snuck it right past us.  Who knows how many years ago?  Way too long ago.  Don't...  At this point, we don't even know.  Don't even try to tell me that that revenue is going toward the parking lot staff.  And, you know, at 40 bucks a pop, that's a lot of money coming in.  It's not going to some 18-year-old waving a flashlight at you.  Well, if you got the Coliseum on the phone, they would say that they don't own the parking lot. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, really?  They gave that to another company.  And that's why it is what it is.  Like, there's not money being kicked back to the Coliseum.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't complain about that.  And politicians and whoever else.  They're probably paying rent.  Yeah.  That is the biggest scam ever.  And I don't know what year it started.  I remember being a kid going to sporting events and you just parked.  You didn't go through and had to pay for parking.  Do you remember this?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you got to go back a ways, but...  I don't remember not paying for concert parking or any of it, man.  I really don't.  I cannot remember...  You got to go way back, Jimmy. 
[01:47:00]  Way back.  There was a time you just...  You got a ticket for a sporting event.  Boom.  You just pulled in and you parked wherever the hell you wanted.  Oh, yeah.  I would love to know a year.  It's got to be the 70s.  70s.  Maybe, maybe early 80s.  Maybe early 80s, but I doubt it.  We used to get parking passes with our small season packages in Chicago.  If you bought 10 tickets, you'd get a parking pass for every one.  It was included in the deal.  It was nice.  They tried taking care of you.  When they played with leather helmets.  What about the other thing where now you got to pay just a ridiculous amount of money 
[01:47:30]  just to have the privilege of buying the seats?  How do they figure that out?  The licensing fee that the Giants and Jets charged.  Oh.  So it's not good enough to just pay for your seat.  Now you have to pay for the privilege of having these seats.  Yeah.  You have a bond that you purchased.  What is that?  Why are fans...  And I mean, honestly, how dumb are you guys out there?  If none of you went, they would stop doing it.  Instead of everybody just lining up, dying to get them.  Because the second somebody decides they're not going to go, someone else is there to fill it. 
[01:48:00]  It's like water.  That's why they do it.  They just leak in.  It's, uh, yeah.  What kind of...  What is the...  What is the license...  Why would they charge you $40 extra?  $40.  I mean, whatever the licensing fee is.  It's up to like $100...  Tens of thousands.  Tens of thousands.  I think I heard...  What?  $20 grand for the Giants.  It's way higher than $20 grand for certain seats.  The best seat in the new Jet Stadium went for $400,000.  Just the license.  There is no reason.  The license?  Did you hear this?  Just for the opportunity to own that seat. 
[01:48:30]  To have season tickets in this seat, you paid...  Was it really $400,000?  Wow.  Where's the best seats in the parking lot facing another team?  Just greed, man.  Because they realize they only got eight home games unless you make the playoffs and all that.  Blah, blah, blah.  So like, well, how can we make even more money off the fans?  Philadelphia Eagles have 50,000 people on their seat waiting list.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm reading.  Every football team has that.  It's amazing.  My bro's on that list.  He figures maybe in 10 years he'll have a shot. 
[01:49:00]  He watches his number go up every year.  And you figure you're only seeing six or seven games a year.  You know?  Someone said they paid $3,000 for XFL season tickets.  All right.  I think it was Andre the Giant package.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  That's funny.  We were young and stupid.  Yeah.  What did we know?  What did we know?  It just makes me hate sporting personalities even more.  Even more.  It just makes me hate them.  Well, what are you going to do?  Well, they're showing those Indian people from the Oscars. 
[01:49:30]  What's wrong with the Indian people?  No, they're just showing them.  What's wrong?  That girl.  That actress is...  Enough of their blue dress already.  They're doing worse dress.  She wasn't badly dressed.  She looked great.  No, but I mean, it's like...  She's beautiful, man.  No, but they're doing best and worst dress.  You don't think she's beautiful?  No.  Every girl has to be white and pale and...  Very, yes.  You have one type.  You don't ever, like, look at other types.  Vampires.  You never go exotic ever?  No, I don't like exotic.  No?  No.  What about, like, a Penelope Cruz with that accent of hers? 
[01:50:00]  She's kind of cute.  She was.  That's kind of exotic, right?  Yeah.  Not the norm.  Yeah, I'll give you that.  But this is way...  That's a little too...  Yeah, she's way out there.  That Indian woman?  Yeah.  I think she's attractive, but I don't know.  I was with a...  You know what's going on in a certain part of that.  I was not.  Not necessarily.  You kind of interrupted me.  That's where I was going.  Oh, are you?  I was with an Indian broad once, and...  Yeah?  Yeah?  Mm. 
[01:50:30]  Oof.  Just when they're done, they've got to start over.  Because it's just constant.  Constant problems.  Wow.  Wow.  What was that?  That's an Indian broad.  Probably not.  No.  Probably not.  No, sorry.  Danny's funny.  Some fine naked pictures of Indian broads.  Yeah.  Indian broads.  I like girls that if they go out in the sun for like five minutes, they get skin poisoning  or sun poisoning.  You got your type.  That's it.  Everyone has their type.  That's your type, which is fine. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  I like when they take cold baths and lay in the bed feeling like a corpse.  That's it.  Ah, how's it going?  Are we going to lose fingers?  Yes.  We're going to take a break.  Everyone wants to talk about this sports thing.  It's unbelievable.  NASCAR is the only sport lowering their prices.  Is that true?  Goddamn.  Helping out the common man.  Ray's giving free parking and free beer to get people into the park.  Wow.  Some good phone calls about this very subject after the break. 
[01:51:30]  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Let's go to the phones.  877-212-ON-A.  We got Jeremy in Nashville.  Hi, good morning, boys.  Good day on the show.  What's up?  Hi.  What St. Louis Blues are doing, I'm not near the bottom of the Western Conference,  and what they're doing to bring people in is paying up to four months of their mortgage.  So it's like, I think the total's like $1,000.  I don't know how far that's going to go, because I don't know anybody who's got a mortgage  that'll be that small.  So, but that's what they're trying to do to bring people in. 
[01:52:00]  Well, that's all well and good, but I want some breaks for my sports teams that are doing  well.  Yeah.  Because, like, I got Islander season ticket, like I said, many times, but I can't go to  the games.  There's nothing to take out of this season.  No.  Whatsoever.  They are beyond the worst team in hockey.  It's not even a fair weather fan thing whatsoever.  It's just, now they're going to give me incentives to go see this team?  Why bother?  You know what?  What's wrong with being a fair weather fan?  Maybe back in 40 years ago. 
[01:52:30]  They're fair weather players.  Exactly.  They don't stick with their team, so why do we have to stick with the team?  The players have no loyalty.  The team has not one ounce of loyalty for fans.  So what is this?  I'm a, I bleed, I bleed, I bleed, I bleed.  Do you?  Do you really, you stupid ass?  I bleed big blue.  A-Rod would step over your body to have sex with Tim Burton movie Body Madonna, which  is fine. 
[01:53:00]  Now, what is, why, why show that loyalty and be a fair weather fan when they win go, when  they lose, let them lose money.  What would it take for, this is a good question for Jimmy, what would it take for, like, a  hardcore fan not to be a hardcore fan anymore?  Let's say, like, A-Rod, you're a huge Yankee fan, and A-Rod, A-Rod, A-Rod had sex with  your wife.  Would you still be a hardcore fan, or would you finally have to go, all right, well, maybe,  it would depend.  If he had sex with her in October, because there was nothing else to do, I'd probably  be very mad.  If it was celebrating the World Series win, I might forgive it. 
[01:53:30]  No, it just took one good reaction to send me on this trail.  How about the day, like, the Yankees win the World Series, but you also find out that  A-Rod's been secretly having sex with your wife.  What happens to you?  I don't really care about the sports.  Do you still buy the World Championship t-shirts and jackets and hats?  Probably, yeah, but I'm very hurried.  It took me one douchey interaction with Jeter that set me on this spiral of just disliked  the athletes.  I had so many dicks that night, I just dislike all of them now. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  I know what you mean.  People are being, like...  Complete jerks.  Right.  One after another, too.  A bunch of dummies who try to be funny.  Yeah.  That stupid jock sense of humor.  Yeah.  Oh, hit a pole.  It's never funny, but people laugh because they're just afraid of them.  Yeah, exactly.  Like stupid Boomer.  Yeah.  Who picked on you.  Oh.  Alpha male.  Pick on me.  He turned out to be a cool guy, though.  We met him at that...  Where do we talk to him?  We had him on in Vegas.  Some golf had him.  No, no.  We talked to him at the Hollander...  Yeah.  Remember the Flying Hollander Brothers? 
[01:54:30]  Yes.  I wonder what they're up to these days.  I don't know.  I'm sure we'll be right there online with them soon.  We saw him at that golfing event, and then...  And Boomer could have been cooler.  We talked to him for like an hour.  But he was such a douche in school.  Yeah.  In elementary school.  Boomer was just such a douche to everybody.  He was a bully.  He would walk around and just cut one in people's faces during lunch.  He would knock your milk off the table.  That's what they all do.  He was just that guy. 
[01:55:00]  By the way, for the people that care, the Islanders only have 42 points this season.  Jason from Columbus has pointed this out.  We're only 26 points out of the last playoff spot.  So that's good news.  We basically have to win 13 games, and the other team has to win.  He has to lose all 13 games.  And it's easy to get into the playoffs in hockey.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Let's answer in.  Let's say how to Rick in Jersey.  Rick.  Yeah, we had... 
[01:55:30]  I've had Yankee season tickets for about 10 years.  And when we got our new tickets, those prices doubled.  So we had to move back.  And they told us that if we didn't sign a five-year contract,  we were going to go up 7% every year.  And if we didn't like it, we could throw our tickets away.  So it was nice.  It was nice.  Yeah, they don't care about the guys that have been supporting the team for decades and generations.  Like, I mean, these tickets are passed down.  Yeah.  Pops dies.  Guess what you get in the will?  The tickets.  The season tickets for Big Blue. 
[01:56:00]  Or whatnot.  But they don't care about that.  Nope.  They don't care about the loyalty.  They don't care about the fact that you've been sitting in those seats during a lot of lean years.  They don't care.  Nope.  They'll boot you out in a second.  Mm-hmm.  So keep being loyal, Thumbbells.  Oh, fairway.  I go to every get...  Do you?  Hit you right in the old pocketbook.  No language.  Yes.  Oh, here we go.  Let's go to Josh on Long Island.  Josh.  Hey, what's going on?  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Hey, Josh.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you. 
[01:56:30]  I have a friend who is a diehard Met fan.  If someone like David Wright were to sleep with his girlfriend or wife, he would actually  be excited because then he'd sleep with someone that's had sex with a Met.  Oh, look at that.  Good for him.  Good for him.  Does that just bother you, Jimmy?  It's so stupid.  It's like...  And believe me, I understand hero worship.  I get it with celebrity.  So I'm not knocking that.  But just that the athletes are such douches.  The majority of them.  The only guys I like are the UFC guys. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  The rest of them I just can't stomach.  How about A-Rod, man?  His whole story's falling apart.  You guys been following this thing?  Yeah.  He's going to have a rough few months here.  Yeah.  Everything he said at the press conference, they're picking apart and going, you can't  get this over the counter in the Dominican Republic.  Oh, sure you can.  That's what he says.  Oh, yeah, you can.  Yeah.  He's a liar.  They're all liars.  He's trying to save their asses.  Getting back to the Islander thing.  Yeah.  The Islanders are having such a bad year that my Ranger friends, they're even like, ugh, 
[01:57:30]  can't even beat you up.  Yeah, usually that rivalry is huge.  Usually it's great.  Even Roland stopped to email me.  He took his shots like anyone else.  And then it's like, hey-hoo.  It's not fun.  It's not fun for the Ranger friends either how bad the Islanders are.  How are the Rangers doing?  They're doing all right.  Yeah.  Well, compared to the Islanders.  Yeah, they're doing all right compared to the Islanders.  Tim in Levittown.  What's up, Tim?  Hey, first time, long time boys.  Wah, wah.  I proceeded to go to a Tampa Bay Rays game last year. 
[01:58:00]  And if you have more than four people in your car, you park for free over there.  All right.  And also with the Tampa Bay Lightning, we went to the game this year.  They finally scored a goal.  And my buddy knocked over my two beers.  We went to the beer shop.  And she filled them up for free.  No way.  You're not getting that in the Coliseum.  You know, when I do go to sporting events outside New York, they're definitely cooler.  Definitely cooler. 
[01:58:30]  You wouldn't get that treatment here in New York, buddy.  No.  We went to game seven of the ALCS, Tampa Bay, Boston.  Yeah.  The Tampa Bay fans were saying, oh, good game.  Good game.  You're doing good.  Tim, you ever find your shoes and glasses?  This guy's just being ripped apart.  One guy, client number 10, says, what is this lady talking about?  And then people are spelling beer like Bia because this is the worst accent ever. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  You really have that Long Island thing going.  You got that down.  Yeah.  Levittown equals Long Island.  That is just the epitome of the Long Island small community.  We got Bill O'Reilly as our man.  We should be proud, right?  Yeah.  All right.  By the way, the Rangers are collapsing.  I should have mentioned that.  They're having a tough run right now.  Well, they need to get rid of Tom Rennie.  That's what I was saying because I bleed Ranger ice. 
[01:59:30]  Got it in my veins.  We need to have Nolan back.  All right.  All right.  We get it.  We need to have Nolan back.  Everybody knows that.  Go to sports.  Back at the Mad Dog.  Yeah.  Go to sports radio.  They'll discuss that point for the next eight hours.  Mad Dog Russo show.  Bye.  And I want to love sports radio.  How far are you going to pick this point apart?  Shut up.  They're going to make the trade. 
[02:00:00]  Are they?  I'm Mad Dog Russo and I'm here to recruit you.  They call me Dog and they go, are we going to make the trade?  Who knows?  Just wait till noon.  Travis.  I talked to Bobby Valentine.  He said that we're not making a trade.  But that's me, Dog.  Shut up.  I'll do the show by myself. 
[02:00:30]  I listen to sports radio and then after five minutes, I'm reminded why I don't listen to  sports radio.  We're not going to be kept in the closet any longer.  Got a 420 batting average in preseason.  You're boring everyone.  Who cares?  No one cares.  Right.  You've got to strengthen that line.  If you don't strengthen that line, you're not going to have a good defense. 
[02:01:00]  Boo.  Hey, Mike.  Boo.  Hey, Mike.  When it's threatening rain and he's facing a left-hander, what is his average?  His average is 272.  But that's only if it's threatening rain.  Let me fix this so my hair looks good.  Hey, Dog.  What if it's a nice sunny day?  Does that average go up?  It all depends.  If he's a switch hitter, it goes over to 306.  But that's only on Tuesdays.  Z.  Z, Z, Z, Z. 
[02:01:30]  I think you've got to go back to 1967 to find a better player with a better start in the  vein.  Okay, Dog.  Yuck and the yuck yuck.  Yeah.  What do you got, Trout?  I was just going back to, you know, how terrible your Islanders are.  Yeah.  That's all right.  I just pulled up tickets for Thursday's game, the next game, against the Maple Leafs, who 
[02:02:00]  you would actually have a small chance of beating because they're not that good either.  Upper level, $70 for one ticket.  Yeah.  To see the worst team in hockey.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  I would just open the gates and go, you know what, let's try to get some new fans.  Let everybody in.  That's what I would do.  Take the hit.  But you might turn on some people to hockey.  Go, hey, it's free.  For the rest of the year.  And you've always got, you know, that one section.  I forget what you guys call it up there.  But, you know, it's like $10 tickets.  Something heaven. 
[02:02:30]  No, Jimmy.  It's Loudsville.  That's what it is.  It's Loudsville.  Loudsville.  We don't talk a lot of hockey.  They play it on ice.  Now back to football, dog.  We have a section called Loudsville.  Loudsville?  Yeah.  No, you don't.  And they get really, really loud.  I guess they get loud in Loudsville.  Yeah.  It should be Loudsville where everybody has lice.  Oh, my God.  You know what? 
[02:03:00]  Loudsville.  We're talking about sports radio.  Sports radio.  You've got to hear what Dave has to say.  This is a good one.  Dave.  Welcome aboard, Dave.  Hey, how you doing?  I've got a trade for you guys.  Beltran and Reyes for the Yankees for Junior and A-Rod.  What do you think?  All right.  What he's referring to, he's nailing, is these sports radio idiots with their fictional trade talk.  Fictional trade.  Would you take LeBron James and shut up? 
[02:03:30]  You're going to have to go for that in a second.  Right.  That's right.  And it's crazy that'll never happen.  And then they'll discuss it for 20 minutes.  I love how Francis, you know, totally makes you feel it, makes the guy, you're an idiot.  Right.  Forget that.  That'll never happen.  He's the only one that knows something else.  Okay.  Yeah.  Mad Dog, I'm thinking, what about Jeter and A-Rod for Superman and Batman?  Well, you've got to give it to Jeter and A-Rod.  They put the asses in the seats is what they do. 
[02:04:00]  And I don't know if Batman and Superman have that kind of pull.  You know, dog, the problem with making that trade, they're going to look at Superman and Batman and see if there's some Roy thing happening there.  There could be steroid issues.  I don't think the League of Justice has any kind of rules or regulations dictating steroid issues.  This could be a problem that they've brought into baseball.  And I don't know if Jeter can be comfortable outside of a Yankee uniform and wearing a cape.  Just ridiculous. 
[02:04:30]  Disparenter.  Does Superman even feel now in the wheelchair, dog?  The League of Justice.  League of Justice.  That's some interleague play right there.  A lot of interleague play, the League of Justice, I don't even know.  They're going to be testing him for steroids, and then they're going to have to test all the superheroes.  I don't know.  What about Aquaman?  Aquaman.  He's going to have to be brought in, and, you know, I don't even know if he's got blood.  Talking about interleague play, how do you tag out Superman if he's hovering over the bases at 10, 20 feet? 
[02:05:00]  Is he going to be allowed to fly as he plays the game of baseball?  This adds a whole new dynamic to the game.  It's possible this.  What about the Invisible Man?  How the hell do you play against the Invisible Man?  He can't be traded for anybody.  All right, you trade the entire San Francisco Giant team.  Right.  Except for one pitcher.  That's all you need.  Okay.  Because then you've got the Invisible guy, and they can't see him and tag him out.  They win every game.  They go to the World Series.  I say World Series two out of the seven games. 
[02:05:30]  In two, because the other team will forfeit.  I can't see anybody.  What about the Spiderman?  He can catch a ball with a web.  That could be a home run.  It's going.  It's going.  It's caught.  How do you play against Spiderman with his webs?  This isn't far-fetched, though.  They would do this break.  They would actually do this break without the humor, by the way. 
[02:06:00]  Without the humor.  Oh, well, they just ran in the first David and Bobo promo.  Oh, nice.  Tim did, so it might have a few different voices in here.  Angelina Jolie, I just saw her from the Oscars.  Jesus Christ, she's fantastic looking.  She's hot.  I don't get it.  I mean, there she looks great.  Really?  She has 11 children?  I just don't get it with her.  With her goddamn, she should smash her entire face into a vat of chapstick. 
[02:06:30]  I think she looks good, man.  Her lips are all cracked.  All right.  She's got those giant, misshapen lips.  They're not sexy or sensuous.  I meant her face, like her forehead.  This is the way her face is.  She looks very healthy.  I mean, all she's done is this out of her womb looks like a Sunny D commercial.  All she's done is pump out babies.  You've got to hide the forehead a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Her lips kind of look like a catcher's mitt.  What do you think?  Would she be allowed to use those lips to catch the ball? 
[02:07:00]  I would think if you could get Angelina Jolie behind the plate, I think it'd have a good catcher.  She got one glove on her hand and the other one on her face.  What if I have a mask?  What do you think about it?  And a third one.  And a third one.  To stop those bounce pitches.  Hands off the plate.  Got it.  I mean, even if she doesn't want to use that, she could use a little Dominican coming out of it.  Well, we got Dawn from Monticello. 
[02:07:30]  Listen to this.  Dawn?  Hello?  Hi.  Wow.  Dawn?  Yeah.  Yeah, I get this all the time.  You should switch voices with Tim.  Chesterfields or Paul Mall?  Ah, Rich.  I'm at him for seeing this.  It don't matter anymore.  What?  Wait, what?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Hold on, Dawn, hold on.  We want to get to know you a little more, like David did with Bobo.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You'll never meet me.  Don't worry about it.  We just want to know you a little bit. 
[02:08:00]  I asked my husband about that.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  Emphysema, right?  You could stay here.  No, I'm not.  We're just talking with you.  No, I want to say what I got to say.  I know you will.  We'll give you the chance.  We'll give you the chance.  But how long did you smoke?  Forty years.  Forty years.  Wow.  Oh, Ricky.  And I enjoyed every minute of it.  Every minute of it.  That's right.  Nobody's going to look in my casket and say, boy, she looks good. 
[02:08:30]  Oh.  God bless Dawn from Monticello.  Wow.  I had fun.  You just turned us around.  She had fun.  That's all she cares about.  Oh, we were going to have some fun with you, but you just turned us around.  All right.  God bless you.  That's great.  Now, can I say what?  Yeah, you are.  Sure, yeah.  Okay, charcoal brick hit lungs.  I asked my husband, if his favorite football player was having sex with me, would he get 
[02:09:00]  upset?  No, he'd get cancer.  No.  His reply was, well, as long as his game improved, I don't give a damn.  Ah.  All right.  So, you had no ill effects from smoking, or you have?  She's got emphysema.  I know.  Apparently.  So, wait, you've had no ill effects, or you have?  Yeah.  Yeah?  How long does the doc give you?  First of all, it depends. 
[02:09:30]  They don't give an exact time.  Yeah?  You know.  Yeah, they kind of give it.  How many?  Two years.  Yeah, two years, plus or minus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You still smoking?  Well, sure.  It's too late now.  I like the attitude.  All right, there.  You're a trooper.  All right, Don.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Denver Pesans calling her Dawn of the Dead.  Very good.  That's where our textiles are going. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, that's good.  It is Dawn Alive Monday.  Linger water.  Our medical costs go up.  Oh, Jesus.  You want to hear the first David and Bobo promo?  Please.  Is it recording?  Okay.  The David and Bobo Show is coming.  It's the David and Bobo Show.  I think this will be a fresh voice in radio.  It's the David and Bobo Show.  Oh, no.  He asks the best questions in the world.  David wants to know.  Someone's got to ask the questions.  Other people won't. 
[02:10:30]  The David and Bobo Show and David.  The David and Bobo Show.  The David and Bobo Show is coming.  Oh, no.  David and Bobo.  I can't sit through that.  You can listen every day when it's on.  You can listen.  I can't sit through that.  I love it.  I love it.  It gives me chills.  That's what we're going for.  Oh, no.  But that's what we're going for.  Wow. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, well, you're going for it.  It worked.  Yeah, sure did.  It was horrible.  All right.  Why don't we get out of here?  We got to go over there.  Yeah.  We go over there now.  We go over there now.  We got Bob Kelly over on the Sirius XM side plug.  Yes, Chicago gig.  I think it's Chicago, yeah.  I think so.  I think you're right.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I'm going to put on a ski mask.  All right.  Yes.  Jack Black's on TV.  What's he doing?  Something crazy, right? 
[02:11:30]  The eyes get me.  He's going to work those eyebrows, I bet.  Oh, there he goes.  He's working those eyebrows.  That's what he does.  Who enjoys that?  Oh.  Who?  Name me 40 people.  What was the movie that made him a star?  Blackboard Orange.  High Fidelity, or what was it called?  High Fidelity was the one.  Yeah, was that the one?  He was in Mars Attacks.  He was in Waterworld.  He was in Waterworld?  Wait.  What did he play, Slug?  What?  Come on.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold the phone.  Come on, E-Rock. 
[02:12:00]  E-Rock.  Who was in Waterworld?  Jack Black?  Jack Black.  What did he play?  He was one of those dudes on the water skis.  Shut up.  What?  I mean, on the jet skis.  He was one of the water guys.  One of the smokers?  Yeah.  He was a water guy.  What?  Yeah.  Did you get to see him?  Or was he like...  Oh boy, we're IMDb and Jack Black right now.  Oh, it was the pilot.  Yeah?  He was the pilot of the plane?  That tries to shoot the cable that... 
[02:12:30]  Paul, what do you got on this?  Wait a minute.  You right?  If I, you know...  He was the pilot in the plane who tried to kill Kevin Costner.  Tried to shoot the cable after the girl shoots the harpoon through it?  I haven't seen it in a number of years.  That's Jack Black?  Yeah, pilot.  1995.  Wow.  He's right, but more importantly, who cares?  Exactly.  I just thought I would have known that seeing the movie 800 times like I have.  Do you like Waterworld?  I think it's a pretty good movie.  It didn't get the greatest reviews, right?  No, it's, you know, it's the real glory on the water. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's the postman on the water.  It's a little long, but it's not such a bad...  Right.  It's not long for his friggin' movies, Kevin Costner's movies.  I liked Jack Black in The Cable Guy, where he played Broderick's...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When they were playing basketball.  Almost swishy friend.  Yes.  Like he was jealous of The Cable Guy.  Yeah.  He was stealing his friend away.  I'll give him that role.  That was pretty good.  Look at Jimmy's new look.  What's wrong with you?  You're in a bomber.  Why are you dressed like this, Jimmy?  Because it's windy and cold out, if I can answer for Claude Rains. 
[02:13:30]  I had to go back a few years for that one.  Do you want to be back to high school?  Do you want to be left alone?  Got a little left alone thing happening.  I want to be left alone.  I want to stay toasty warm.  Yes.  And a boy of my soft skin should not have wind burn.  I'm tweeting the crap out of that one for everybody.  That's a horrendous picture.  All right, let's get out of here.  Later. 
[02:14:00]  O.B. and Anthony continuing.  Robert Kelly in studio.  The fans making their way to the bleachers.  We had two.  Were there more?  We got like five or six now.  Oh, my God.  It's doubled.  Look at us.  And a woman.  Oh, my God.  It's like a sitcom.  A girl.  Two guys, a girl, and a pizza place.  Remember that one?  That was a laugh getter.  Oh, gosh.  Ryan Reynolds.  Wasn't it?  Yeah.  Before he was famous.  Anthony, in between shows, I was checking my Twitter. 
[02:14:30]  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Checking my Twitter.  Twitter.  You bet you're bippy.  But the only reason I mention that is because I got something from, I think it's Stephen  S. from Bayshore.  But I don't know if he is responsible for this, but I became aware of this because of  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Okay, but we are.  Can you pop up this website for everybody you saw?  Have you seen this yet?  No, but I just.  Holy shit.  This is going to be the thing.  Nice.  We love the things. 
[02:15:00]  This is going to take off.  You see it?  You can't put it up there?  Wait, hang on.  I don't want to give it out.  I don't want to give it out yet.  I don't want to give out the address.  I don't want to give it out yet.  Can you get it up there for everybody?  And.  Work on that.  Oh, I saw something for a second.  You ready?  You ready for this?  Yeah.  The unveiling of Fat E-Rock.com.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  He is so fucked. 
[02:15:30]  Somebody came up, and I don't know if it was Stephen S.  He just brought it to my attention.  It's a new website called Fat E-Rock.com.  I bring nothing to the table.  I eat it.  I eat it where I find it.  Oh, and there's pictures of Fat E-Rock all over the place.  It's Fat E-Rock at my house.  Yeah.  But it's Fat E-Rock at Curves.  No, what are you doing?  I got to put it on for the guys outside.  Oh, okay.  You're about to show my favorite Fat E-Rock.com picture that has made its way to the website. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, go lift up a little bit.  They're dying.  Look at this one.  Fat E-Rock with a bunch of pigs.  Oh, like a summer wrestler.  They're using the same Fat E-Rock Photoshop picture.  Yes, it's E-Rock's head on.  Is that a woman's body?  I don't know if that's a woman.  It's got to be a woman, right?  I don't know, though.  They're dying out there.  The five or six people that are here to check out the show today are loving the Fat E-Rock.com website. 
[02:16:30]  Fat E-Rock on one side of a busted seesaw.  I'm thinking I should probably get a hold of the owners of EricNagel.com.  Sam, can you do that?  Sam, can you own EricNagel.com?  Sam bought EricNagel.com.  Ask me who owns SteveCarlesi.com.  Who owns SteveCarlesi.com?  Danny owns that.  And I'm also the proud holder of Travis Taft as well.  Wow.  JimNorton.com? 
[02:17:00]  No, I don't.  Please get that.  I'll fly it from you.  Wow.  Within the next, I'd say, 10 to 20 minutes, you'll be able to get to FatERock.com via EricNagel.com.  All right.  Good.  They'll be linked together.  That's nice.  FatERock.com.  Holy shit.  Who's the prick?  That is hilarious.  I didn't even notice that first picture up there.  It's a broken seesaw.  Yeah, the broken seesaw.  The main picture on FatERock.com is him next to a broken seesaw. 
[02:17:30]  I don't know why this is funny.  Holy shit.  It's the same Photoshop E-Rock picture in every photo.  Yeah.  Every single one.  They don't have a variation of the FatERock.  And they put the FatERock.com over the FatERock Photoshop so you can't steal it.  Yeah.  Because it's so fucking, such a lucrative site this is going to be.  Bill McKee from Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh.  Holy fuck.  I almost shit when the homepage came up. 
[02:18:00]  FatERock.com.  That's all it takes to get our attention.  FatERock.com.  Fantastic.  Bravo.  Speaking of, can't change to a fox, huh?  Huh?  Why?  What's up?  I don't know.  Car chase.  One of those LA car chases.  Oh, you got a little car chase action?  Yeah.  We like the car chase action.  Somebody with a head enlarging kit chasing that fucking traffic chick?  This just in.  Super Agent Bob Eatman has signed David and Bobo. 
[02:18:30]  Anthony.  Wow.  He knows cutting edge entertainment when he sees it.  And according to this poster on the Instant Feedback, there's a 12-city syndication deal  with Westwood One for the David and Bobo show.  Did you hear the David and Bobo show, Robert Kelly?  I got a little glimpse of it.  It's actually mesmerizing.  Yeah, isn't it?  Yeah, we like, just like everything else, we'll run the David and Bobo bit into the ground,  unfortunately.  Of course we do.  But enjoy it until it gets to that point.  That's how we work.  We have one more clip from the David and Bobo show we want to play for everybody? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Two?  I think so.  Yeah, I think that's two.  Two clips?  Where are they?  I got them in front of me.  This is intern David and, of course, our good friend, Bobo.  Yeah.  Well, I got the promo.  Should I play the promo for everybody again?  Should we have to?  No, if we're talking David and Bobo, we got to play the promo, the sweeper.  You need production around these bits.  Let's get some.  We got it right here.  No, we don't.  We're recording.  The David and Bobo show is coming. 
[02:19:30]  It's the David and Bobo show.  I think this will be a fresh voice in radio.  It's the David and Bobo show.  He asks the best questions in the world.  David wants to know.  Someone's got to ask the questions.  Other people won't.  The David and Bobo show.  And David.  The David and Bobo show.  The David and Bobo show is coming.  Oh, no.  David and Bobo.  You can listen every day when it's on. 
[02:20:00]  You can listen.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I fucking hate that.  I love it.  It gives me, like, chills.  Of the douche variety?  Of my spine, yes.  Not even.  It's like, it's fucking horrible.  Horrible.  Wow.  I love the obnoxiousness of the...  It's just terrible.  That's what I love about it.  Reminds me of all those awful ones he was doing.  Yeah.  A faraway phone call Thursday. 
[02:20:30]  Tickle you underarms Friday.  We're treading water over there at fucking CBS.  Yeah.  Tip your cap to a stranger Tuesday.  Yeah.  Let's say out of Tim in Boston, he's a David and Bobo fan, Jimmy.  Tim, go ahead.  I love David and Bobo.  These guys rule.  Yeah.  I want a five-hour David and Bobo program.  No, you don't.  I hope you also love whatever nurse is scrubbing the burn wounds on your chest after a fire engulfs your home. 
[02:21:00]  Long-winded.  Not a big problem.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I knew that was happening.  I was along for the ride for a little while, then I had to get off.  What happened?  Periods falling off that sentence.  Yeah.  40 minutes into it, you bailed.  Jesus.  That was the fucking water world of jokes.  I meandered.  I made no points.  I put in semicolons.  This is book three.  We got it.  No, you didn't.  That was a good one.  We got Eric from Virginia Tech. 
[02:21:30]  He loves to promo for the David and Bobo show.  See, Jimmy?  Wes, the trucker.  Wes, welcome aboard, Wes.  How are you, Wes?  You know what?  Every time I hear David just stumble with, oh, you watch the show every week, every day?  Oh, every week?  I just, the more I hear that, the more I just laugh and just play it every day.  I can't remember that.  Can we play the one clip again, and then we got new David and Bobo stuff.  Yay!  But we're heading somewhere with the new David and Bobo.  Yay!  Trust me.  Trust me on this. 
[02:22:00]  Who's Bobo?  Bobo's Daniel.  You might have met Daniel.  Yes.  He's our friend.  Yeah.  He's a special friend.  He's a special friend.  Yes.  And we've taken him under our wing, and we protect him.  He comes by every Friday and loves the show.  He's an Uber fan.  He's a Mets fan.  If you had to, picture what you do.  And his family's very appreciative that we've taken the high road with Daniel.  Picture what you'd have to do if you had to tart again.  Yes, yes.  Oh, here we go.  Tom in Chicago. 
[02:22:30]  What?  Tom in Chicago.  Hey.  Hey.  We're Dave and Bobo.  We're a couple of guys that think horrible radio comes by us very easy.  Oh.  Wow.  Look at you.  Look at you lingering longer.  I'll say.  Linger longer.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Godspeed.  Yeah, this is the one that drove us nuts.  Where's the one where he asked the question a million fucking times?  It's this one.  It's the beginning of that one.  Of five?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Good evening.  I've got to get more time. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul's a good boy.  No, Uncle Paul.  Don't talk me loud.  He's an adult.  Huh?  Popo's an adult.  So, Bobo, what are your plans this weekend, man?  What are you going to do?  This weekend, I'm going to visit my cousin.  I got a DVD box.  Got a lost DVD box that I've been trying to get him into Lost for quite a while.  Oh, you like the show Lost.  You a big fan?  Do you watch every week, every day, Lost, when it's on every week?  Every week.  That's all we want. 
[02:23:30]  Every day, when it's on, every week, Lost.  Did he catch that?  He has a special way of asking questions.  Listen again here.  I've been trying to get him into Lost for quite a while.  Oh, you like the show Lost.  You a big fan?  Do you watch every week, every day, Lost, when it's on every week?  Every week.  I love it.  What an ass.  All right.  New David and Bobo material, just in case you missed it on Friday.  We're heading somewhere here, though.  We're heading somewhere here. 
[02:24:00]  Yes, it is.  To fucking unemployment.  Hold on there, man.  We got Mike on 912.  Yo, Mike, what's up, man?  Hey, why don't you...  You're supposed to have a co-host there.  It's a fucking co-host.  You're not interviewing the guy that's supposed to be your co-host.  You're fucking talking to Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  And, like, you're interviewing him.  Talk about something.  Get a fucking subject.  And then fucking talk about it. 
[02:24:30]  You don't know how to carry on a conversation.  This is Bobo we're talking about here.  This is Bobo we're talking...  You're a fucking retard.  You don't fucking...  Hey, Bobo, what do you think about...  Bobo, what do you think about the microphone for your face?  Bobo, what do you think about...  This is...  This is, uh...  What do you think about fucking shitting?  This is Bobo we're talking with here.  You don't pick a topic and fucking talk to the guy about it.  You think so?  You don't fucking retard.  Why don't you host a show with Bobo, all right?  And then you see what you can talk about with him, all right?  It does. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  Yeah, I thought so.  You hung up, huh?  That's right.  That's what I thought, man.  Great.  Good for you.  I don't know.  These callers are being...  These callers are being really ridiculous.  Bobo, what do you think about these callers, huh?  They're being pretty ridiculous.  They're being pretty ridiculous, all right.  But I have to admit, though, that does make interesting radio hearing these guys.  All right, so...  Okay, fine.  So you want to talk about a topic?  Do you have any topics you're interested in, Bobo?  You know, fucking Bobo is the first radio show host that is also a listener at the same time. 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  He's enjoying the fact...  He's just like, it does make interesting radio.  Right.  You already got his voice down.  David, you didn't like that mic caller, did you?  Yeah.  Not at all, huh?  Let him come on.  Come on, Mike.  We need him on a stopwatch.  That's the key to having David on our fucking show.  Stopwatch.  The fuck out of him.  You didn't like Mike when he called your radio show on Friday?  I didn't like any of the callers. 
[02:26:00]  They're all being pretty rude.  But you really didn't like Mike, because the next track I'm going to play here, you gave him a good trashing.  Yeah, he was pretty rude.  All right.  Thanks, David.  Yeah, Bobo, if I may ask before that, you know Mike, the guy that just called before.  What do you think about this guy, Mike, that just called before, if I may ask real quick?  I think a lot of people are just getting used to this, because this is just a new thing, that they're just hearing this.  After all, this is the first show.  Right.  This is the debut, so of course.  Right, so.  But did you think he was like a real asshole, and you think he was like a real asshole?  I think that guy was a personal asshole. 
[02:26:30]  Like, he's ruining our show and making fun of our show like this.  That fucking idiot asshole was ruining our show and saying rude things, telling us how to run our show.  This is the Dave and Bobo show.  Come on.  Come on, Bobo.  You got to have some stuff about him.  Like, what do you want to do to, like, if Mike for some, pretend Mike was in the studio right now.  They called, what would you want to do to him right now?  He was rude and made fun of your show and was trying to tell you what to do.  What would you want to do to him right now?  What did he say to you on the show?  What would you want to do to him, Bobo?  I'd say,  Mom! 
[02:27:00]  Somebody, somebody get this guy.  That's what you would do?  You wouldn't you take a fist and knock it to his head and beat him up and fucking punch him out and beat the shit out of that guy for all of what he said to you?  Heck yeah, I'd probably go, I'd probably knock the guy out after.  You knocked the guy out, but what was that before?  What was that noise you were making before?  Come on, you wouldn't just, like, go there and make noises.  You'd fucking punch him in the mouth.  You'd beat him up.  You'd knock him down.  You'd bust him out.  You'd send him to the hospital.  You'd want to kill that guy, wouldn't you?  He was rude.  On your debut of the show, you had a rude collar like that. 
[02:27:30]  That's pretty rude, man.  If I admit that, I'd want him to look like a UFC victim.  A UFC victim?  There you go, man.  You'd kick him in the cunt, wouldn't you, Bobo?  I know I would kick that guy in the cunt.  I think I'd go one step further.  I think I'd bring out the old flamethrower.  The old flamethrower?  Yeah, I'd fuck that guy in his mouth, wouldn't you?  I don't know about that, but...  You wouldn't do that, Bobo?  I think I'd probably bring out the whole rocket launcher on the guy.  Bobo, say goodbye to the callers.  All right. 
[02:28:00]  Bye, callers.  Opie and Anthony Mornings.  God bless Bobo.  He goes, I don't think I'd do that.  I don't think I'd do that.  That whole fucking another man in the mouth.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Bobo rules.  He's going to use a flamethrower.  I love Bobo.  Bobo rules.  David and Bobo.  David, what do you think?  Why were you so mad at Mike, for Christ's sake?  He just criticized you.  Yeah, that's exactly why I was mad at him.  Don't you think he had kind of a point, though, that you weren't a partner, an on-air partner with Bobo? 
[02:28:30]  You were like it was your show, and you were interviewing him poorly instead of just you guys.  You see how we all kind of hang out and talk about things?  We try to do the hang.  Get to know each other.  Yeah.  Hi, Jim.  There was something that happened on Friday, right?  There was a little trash talking of Bobo.  So, who hurt David?  David, very disappointed with the fact that we teamed him up with Bobo.  Yeah, I was asking David after the show.  I said, so what did you think?  How'd it go?  And he's just like, well, you know, I wish I had a better co-host. 
[02:29:00]  You know, Bobo, he just wasn't getting it done.  I just didn't like him.  I didn't like Bobo.  So, apparently, David thinks that Bobo was the big problem of the David and Bobo show.  Is Bobo a child?  No, he's not a child.  Is he an adult?  Yeah, he's an adult.  Is he like over 20?  He's an adult.  Over 20?  Yeah, yeah.  Not over 30, right?  No.  I don't know.  He's in his 20s.  In his 20s?  He's a good guy.  He's a good kid.  Does he wear, like, he's a good kid?  He wears a Mets hat.  He's a good kid, Bobby.  He wears a Mets hat.  He wears a Mets hat?  Yes, he does. 
[02:29:30]  He's a big fan of the Metropolitans.  How big is the Mets hat?  He's a good kid.  Is it the biggest?  It's Mr. Mets hat.  Hey, he's a good kid.  It's a Mr. Mets hat.  We like him.  His family appreciates that we treat Bobo with respect.  How long is his tongue?  We like Bobo.  Does his tongue come out like a lizard and hit his shin?  I'm just trying to find out who Bobo is.  He's a normal kid.  What kind of haircut does he have?  And he really is a fan of this radio show.  Come back Friday and you can see him for yourself. 
[02:30:00]  He's a good boy.  Oh, he comes in just on Fridays?  He's a Friday guy.  Is that when he's not working at Pizza Hut?  He's a Friday guy.  He's a Friday guy.  Cleaning up the lobby?  Yes.  We open the gates.  His nickname on Whackback, I think, is B. Lithering.  What do you got, Sam?  There was no...  Danny said apparently he thought that it would have been better without Bobo.  Yeah.  What David said to me was no apparently at all because he specifically said the show would  have been much better with a different co-host.  Bobo ruined your show, do you think? 
[02:30:30]  Both of your show?  I don't know if he ruined it.  I don't know.  We just didn't...  He ruined it.  We hadn't talked before him before the show started.  We didn't really get...  How about this?  Everyone is clamoring for it.  So you guys are going to do a little more David and Bobo.  You and small doses are good.  Very small.  So 10 or 15 minutes we're going to give you Friday.  And if Bobo comes in early, how about you guys do a little pre-meeting?  I think that would be a good idea to have a pre-show.  And then we'll see if it's a little different when you hit the airwaves this Friday.  We've got to have a pre-show meeting, come up with some topics to discuss. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, there we go.  We lost the cuff on Friday.  I didn't know what to talk about, so I didn't plan anything with him.  David, what do you feel Bobo's biggest weakness was, though?  I wish we could get Bobo to call a show.  His weakness was just that it was like what I just said.  We didn't have anything prepared or anything to talk about.  And I didn't know...  We both didn't know anything about each other, our styles or anything like that.  I thought you got to the bottom of things.  You asked some good questions, I thought.  I asked some good questions, but that was just because I didn't know him.  I think if we had another radio show, we'd want to talk about a certain topic.  All right, listen.  Maybe you would have been better prepared if you didn't do things like post on Facebook 
[02:31:30]  at 7.30 in the morning during the show.  Oh, no.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Were you posting on Facebook today?  Definitely, yes.  Boy.  You shook your head no, but went definitely yes.  Yeah, he knew it was in a corner.  You like posting on Facebook during the show?  It's all right.  Oh, no.  See, I'm just asking why you feel you should be looking at things like Facebook and posting  pictures on your... 
[02:32:00]  Posting comments on your Facebook when the show is on.  Oh, I don't know why.  Maybe he sees us all on our phones the entire show.  I learned it from you, okay?  Someone's got to, like, not do it.  I'm usually with you, but I'm looking.  Jimmy's on his phone.  You'll be on yours.  Yeah, but I won't miss the beat, though.  I'll be tweeting my ass off in a few minutes.  Of course.  I won't miss a beat.  I'll believe it.  I'm with the show the whole time.  I don't miss a fucking thing.  Of course.  So why did you think Bubba wasn't a good host?  Oh. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, I think that was something.  Oh.  Let me know those phones.  They're lit with David comments.  This could get a little ugly, David.  Why don't you get some headphones on?  David, give the kids some headphones.  Look at him.  He's old.  You're just kind of walking around a little dejected today.  What's wrong with you, David?  Are you sad?  Is it anything else?  Something personal happened at home?  Family all right?  Everything going good?  No, I'm not sad at all.  No.  Everything good at home?  What's the matter, son?  We got him on the stopwatch.  You need a kiss?  You only got 10 more minutes left in your appearance.  I'm telling you.  For the good of the show, we got to cut your appearance. 
[02:33:00]  I just want to make sure everything's okay.  Everything's okay, yes.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Corinne in Jersey.  Corinne.  Hey, guys.  Any chance David and Bobo will do a bra bombing on Friday?  Oh.  No, they're not that awful.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Let's go to Wes.  Wes?  Yo.  Hey, Wes.  Um, oh, you kind of just blew my spot up, man.  What did I do?  Yeah.  Uh, I was going to tell David how, uh, he was making the comment of it was their first 
[02:33:30]  show when it should have been their only show.  Oh, they had a lot of confidence calling it their first show.  You're right.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Because, you know, they shouldn't be thinking it was a one and done, but they were very confident.  They're like, hey, it's our first show.  So, you know.  Yeah.  A little too tough.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  What's up, bo-bo-boy?  Hey, Charlie.  Bobo.  Uh, we understand your sister calls you that, but why does your sister call you that? 
[02:34:00]  How important are the B's in your name, Bobo?  How important are the O's in your name, Bobo?  Come on, call me, Bobo.  Yeah, there's a little Larry King in David there, huh?  As he was interviewing Bobo.  Is he, uh, maybe an inspiration to you, Larry King?  You know, asking inane questions that just go on and on.  They have the same face.  Pray to the same God.  Maybe you should get some suspenders next time you do the show.  You think so?  Yeah.  Get a little character going before you do it. 
[02:34:30]  You get into it a little more.  You have some direction as you go.  Atta boy, Bobo.  You know what I mean?  Oh, Bobo.  I know.  All right.  Let's go to Troy in Cleveland.  Troy.  Welcome aboard, Troy.  Thanks for joining the program.  How's it going, Jimmy?  Better now that you called.  Godspeed.  Yeah, Troy, man.  Just wondering when David's internship's over, so I don't want to turn my radio back on.  Oh, no.  That's not happening.  Oh, boy.  Kevin, how do you respond to that?  Why don't you have some lightning quick responses?  I don't know what to say.  That's terrible. 
[02:35:00]  He's dejected.  All right, Kevin, go ahead.  That's terrible.  Yeah, listen, I'm calling from Facebook.  I noticed that David's been posting vulgarities on the site.  Are you cursing people out on Facebook, David?  I'd have to agree.  Why are you cursing people out on Facebook?  I don't know.  I just think it's funny.  It's very funny.  I think we're going to have to delete his account, boys.  I think it's time for you.  I mean, he's being very vulgar and confrontative and abusive, and we can't fend that on Facebook.  Let's confrontative.  What does confrontative mean, sir? 
[02:35:30]  We get that you're trying to be Facebook guy, but more importantly, it's true that you're  cursing out people on Facebook.  Yeah.  Why?  Are they getting to you?  I don't know.  Sometimes people are rude.  Sometimes I don't know half these people, and it just sounds like a funny thing to do  to make fun of all these people on Facebook.  He's not responding to people who are mean to him.  Oh, really?  People say, David, it's an honor to be your friend on Facebook, and he'll respond, good  for you.  I don't know you.  Are you a little afraid of new people?  I don't know.  I just don't know these people. 
[02:36:00]  But you shouldn't be on Facebook or MySpace, because it's all about having just fake friends.  You just go with the fact that they're your fake friends.  Okay.  This thing might not be for you.  I don't know if it is.  He proudly showed me a message today.  Somebody left him a message that said, you should be called king of all interns from now  on.  And David thought the appropriate response was, good for you.  You should be called gay man from now on.  Oh, wow.  Did you get that person?  You should be called that.  Yes.  Wow.  Henceforth. 
[02:36:30]  Don the Trucker has a good instant feedback.  That woman suggested they do a bra bombing, which hurts our soul, obviously.  Yes.  Because we were just trying to, you know, figure out this radio thing.  But Don the Trucker is saying that you should have David and Bobo reenact some of your real  hacky bits from the old days.  That would be good.  We got some directions.  Yeah, but who would be who?  Plenty of those.  Who would be who?  Would Anthony be Bobo?  Who gives a shit?  Mike in Arizona.  Mike E.  Hey, boys.  Hey. 
[02:37:00]  Jim, you was wondering if Bobo was a child.  I was thinking they ought to change it to David and Bobo.  Adult radio.  What do you mean?  Adult.  D-O-L-T.  Adult radio.  Is that what you're getting at?  All right.  Matt in Washington.  Matt.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Matt.  I had a little bit of an issue on Friday.  I was really excited to hear David and Bobo.  And, David, you ruined me with your screechy voice when Mike called. 
[02:37:30]  And so my issue is, number one, watch your voice.  Number two, ask one question.  Don't repeat the same question to Bobo 80 times and expect him to answer 80 times.  What did you think I got Mike?  Did you like Mike?  Mike was kind of a dick, right?  Enough.  Ask him one time.  Let him answer and go from there.  Right.  All right.  Very good.  Speaking of which, yeah, let's get back to that Mike thing. 
[02:38:00]  That guy really bothered you?  Yes, he did.  Why?  He should have.  He was very rude to you.  He was rude and he was annoying.  He wasn't funny.  He didn't say anything insightful.  He just kind of dumped on you.  Exactly.  You got it, Jimmy.  And a lot of what you were telling the callers, though, which I noticed, was, hey, why don't  you, you know, come on here and try this?  Right.  Right.  Yes.  And I thought that was pretty good of you to, you know.  You said that to Mike, too, I do believe.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, why don't you do a fucking real show?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Because that's a good comeback because, you know, you're the one doing it and not, you 
[02:38:30]  know, somebody else.  He is a dopey caller.  Yeah, he is.  Driving home from his job or whatever he's doing.  We should get that Mike to, I don't know.  Why?  So you get him on the show, but for what, though?  What if he confronts you verbally?  Yeah.  Then what?  I don't know.  It would just be a verbal argument back and forth, probably.  You should fucking make mincemeat out of him.  Yeah.  I should.  You killed him afterwards.  Mincemeat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, easy.  You know what?  I let it fly.  I'd settle it.  You told him, though.  Yeah.  I certainly did.  You certainly, yeah.  You certainly did. 
[02:39:00]  I didn't want anything to do with that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Nothing at all.  Mm-hmm.  You should play that again.  I think so, too.  Hear how nasty he sounded.  Yeah.  The trashing of Mike or the Mike calling?  No, I think Mike calling.  Mike calling.  Honestly, I don't mind.  Hold on there, man.  We got Mike on line 12.  Yo, Mike, what's up, man?  Hey, why don't you...  You're supposed to have a co-host there.  It's a fucking co-host.  You're not interviewing the guy that's supposed to be your co-host. 
[02:39:30]  You're fucking talking to Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, and, like, you're interviewing  him.  Talk about something.  Get a fucking subject and then fucking talk about it.  You don't know how to carry on a conversation.  This is Bobo we're talking.  This is Bobo we're talking about here.  This is Bobo we're talking.  You're a fucking retard.  You don't fucking...  Hey, Bobo, what do you think about...  Bobo, what do you think about the microphone for your face?  Bobo, what do you think about...  This is...  This is a... 
[02:40:00]  Bobo, what do you think about fucking shitting?  This is Bobo we're talking with here.  Pick a topic and fucking talk to the guy about it.  You think so?  You don't fucking retard.  Why don't you host a show with Bobo, all right?  And then you see what you can talk about with him, all right?  Oof.  All right?  Yeah, I thought so.  You hung up, huh?  That's right.  That's what I thought, man.  Great.  Good for you.  I don't know.  These callers are being...  These callers are being really ridiculous.  Bobo, what do you think about these callers, huh?  They're being pretty ridiculous. 
[02:40:30]  They're being pretty ridiculous, all right.  But I have to admit, though, that does make interesting radio hearing these guys.  All right.  So, okay.  Okay, fine.  So, you want to talk about a topic?  Are you on any topics you're interested in, Bobo?  So, there you go.  Hearing these guys.  Hearing these guys.  It does make interesting radio hearing these guys.  Is he wearing, like, a clown suit?  A cartoon character.  Shut up.  He really is great.  I'm trying to get a visual of what he was.  We like Bobo, all right?  How big are his hands?  We like Bobo.  I just want to know how big his hands are.  His family is very appreciative. 
[02:41:00]  This is, like, his finger, like, index finger smell like Bobo.  He's like the human being, Bobby.  Does his index finger smell like Bobo?  I just want to know that.  So, there you go.  Mike.  I like how David makes people so mad they're not even kidding when they're calling  the show.  That guy was so serious with, like, dude, seriously, you don't fucking interview the  co-host.  Yeah.  He even made Bobo, who I'm guessing, whatever.  He actually snapped him out of his mush brain mode. 
[02:41:30]  We like him.  Because he was joking.  Yeah, flamethrowers.  And then he actually said something.  He went, nah, I'm going to be normal on this one.  But the guy was being a dick, though.  I mean, because the guy could have said, look, David, I think you're doing a bit too much  interviewing with your co-host.  But he didn't talk to you respectfully.  He's just kind of like a coward.  He was infuriated, I think, that such an ass was on the airwaves.  That's a really good point you make, Jimmy, because he could have, like, called me out  in a nicer way, like, just explained to me nicely.  Well, but in face-to-face at least, he's like a faggot.  He says it on the phone.  Yeah.  Right.  Why don't you have him come in and face-to-face do it? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  You're good live.  That's a good idea.  Maybe we should.  You'll talk.  You'll fucking take him down.  How do I reach out and contact this guy?  I'm sure he can hear you.  I don't know.  Well, maybe I could find him or something.  I do give an invitation to that guy, I think.  Why don't you do that guy and test it?  Hey, what's the matter with you?  Why don't you fucking, you know, it's Bobo, Bobo and everything.  Why don't you fucking pick a topic and stick with that instead of interviewing the fucking  guy?  Hey, Bobo. 
[02:42:30]  What the fuck?  You know, Bobo.  Well, you do this, do that.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You don't interview the fucking guy.  You're on a party, you asshole.  You're a fucking asshole.  Not bad.  Not a strongest impression, but not bad.  That was good.  No, that was very good.  Yeah.  That was good.  I liked it a lot.  It was very good because you were talking to Anthony and you trashed Anthony during your  David and Bobo show.  Dummy.  Anthony was Mike.  I couldn't tell that was me.  I was driving home in my vehicle and I was so angry. 
[02:43:00]  That wasn't you, was it?  That was absolutely me.  I didn't know that.  Oh, no.  And when you told me, yeah, why don't you come in here and do radio?  I thought it was pretty fucking funny because I had just gotten done.  Yeah, he just did his radio show.  That was really you?  I thought it was a caller named Mike.  I don't know.  He didn't sound like you at all.  Well, thank you.  No, as a matter of fact, Danny picked out something.  Yeah, well, I was saying to Ed over the weekend that in that call, when he finally  gets through as Mike, he just, he forgets to put on a voice and then you could hear 
[02:43:30]  as he's trying to stumble through that first sentence.  He's got to find the Mike voice.  Yeah.  He was like, oh, this sounds much like me.  Hey, you got to, you got to do a radio show that's a little better.  Wait, let me hear that.  I totally am just me at the beginning.  Let me hear that.  Okay, hold on there, man.  We got Mike on line 12.  Yo, Mike, what's up, man?  Hey, why don't you?  Danny pointed out, I'm like, you totally nailed me. 
[02:44:00]  You were so Anthony.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I don't want to be Anthony.  You and I became retarded Tony Monero.  Okay, hold on, Danny.  We got Mike on line 12.  Yo, Mike, what's up, man?  Hey, why don't you?  You're supposed to have a co-host there.  And then he runs up the engine, and he's ready to go.  Oh, fuck, I just wrecked my whole bit.  Nice.  I'm a douche.  And the stopwatch says it's time for David to get the fuck off the radio. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, David, there go the headphones.  Small doses, David.  He's being let out by his handler.  There goes Sam.  Sam is taking him out of the studio.  I'm telling you, small doses.  David.  Real quick, did you have a pretty lengthy conversation this morning on Facebook?  Back and forth.  A lot of back and forth going on.  Oh, my God.  Look at him leaning him up.  I know.  Did you see him just twitch?  What's the matter, David?  Nothing.  He doesn't like being touched, man.  Oh, oh.  David, you don't like being touched, right? 
[02:45:00]  Go ahead.  No.  Yeah.  No.  Touch him.  No.  So, David, what?  Yeah, so you had a pretty lengthy conversation this morning?  Lengthy?  Lengthy?  I don't know.  That means he's thinking of an answer.  Were you feeling bad, so then you had a conversation with someone to kind of make you feel a little  better?  No, I wasn't feeling bad at all, no.  About some of the things that people say on Facebook?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like the way people say what people say on Facebook.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:45:30]  So then you had a conversation with somebody that kind of made you feel better, right?  No.  Really?  It didn't make me feel better.  I'm still pretty upset about that one, that picture that someone posted.  What are you upset about?  It's rude.  What picture is it?  What is it?  The one that's up there on the screen.  Or it was there before.  I don't know if it's still there.  It's a nice picture.  Oh, no.  Wait, you don't like the picture of you and then the Revenge of the Nerds guy?  You look pretty close?  No, because the point of that idiot poster is that he's comparing me to the Revenge of  the Nerds guy that I look like him.  Oh, I didn't pick that up. 
[02:46:00]  Well, the glasses make it a little different.  Yeah, yeah.  Barely.  That's it.  Yeah, a little bit.  David, you can't be social networking then.  No, I guess not, no.  Because these people will always try to knock you down.  They'll always be rude to me, yeah.  You're too oversensitive for social networking, I think.  I guess so.  I guess I've got to stop.  There's always someone out there that will try to knock you down.  That's true.  There are a lot of rude people out there.  Do you try to pick up girls on Facebook?  Not really, no.  Do you talk to a lot of girls?  Not really.  Just like one.  One girl?  No, one girl.  Marianne girl, yeah.  Who's this lucky girl? 
[02:46:30]  It's the Marianne girl.  The Marianne girl.  You've got to stop her.  No other girls?  I talk to a lot of the girls, but I don't try to pick them up like I did in Marissa.  I didn't try to do that.  What?  Like Marissa.  Like Marissa.  I mean Marianne, I mean.  Oh, wait a minute.  I mean Marianne, I mean.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  Boy, did you fucking slip there, didn't you?  Marianne, I mean.  Coin city yourself.  Wait, what's going on?  Well, apparently he's just having lengthy conversations with Marissa on Facebook. 
[02:47:00]  It wasn't lengthy.  Oh, you just slipped though.  You totally slipped, dude.  It wasn't lengthy.  Not like, you know, with Marissa.  I mean.  I am not.  Yeah, huh?  Did she converse with you?  Someone was very excited that a certain young lady was being nice to him on Facebook this  morning.  Well, of course, I found out about that.  That's what I'm talking about, David.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  She was just, I don't know. 
[02:47:30]  I posted on the, what happened was I posted on Facebook.  No, what happened was I read that the guy compared me to the Avenger the Nerds guy.  Then I posted on Facebook that I was upset about it.  And then she said, oh, yeah, it's rude of that guy to do that.  And I said, yeah, it really is rude.  We had a conversation about that.  You must be thinking about it, though, if you're, you know, all of a sudden her name  comes up out of nowhere like that.  Complete mistake.  Is Jim an alien?  Are you a fucking alien?  What are you eating?  Do you eat tinfoil, too, you fucking weirdo? 
[02:48:00]  Bobby has just been staring at Jimmy.  He's got saline solution, celery, Cool Whip, and a banana.  I'm eating.  Eating what, you fucking?  A fucking puzzle.  Which one of these things do not belong?  A banana with fat-free Cool Whip, which was suggested to me by MJ's.  What's wrong with that?  You have celery?  Because it was supposed to be fat-free peanut butter, but they didn't have fat-free celery.  Who the fuck eats Cool Whip at fucking 10 in the morning? 
[02:48:30]  And then scoops it onto a fucking banana.  You're a fucking giraffe.  Delicious.  You're a zoo animal.  I got a banana that shoots the Cool Whip out of it.  You want to eat that?  Yeah, exactly.  I know.  He's just trying to make it more comfortable.  Yes, he really is.  Just put your fucking face down onto the banana when you get the Cool Whip.  Let it get all in your eyes.  Why don't you draw some veins on the side of the banana?  You should have said I should dip it in chocolate first and then sit on it.  That would have made me look like a black cock-loving faggot.  Just a banana on a Cool Whip beat, motherfucker. 
[02:49:00]  That's great.  He's a fucking idiot.  He just sucked the banana off.  It's a fucking perfectly healthy snack.  Yeah.  It's called Bukkake.  Every day he does have a nice combination of stuff in front of him.  That's fucking fat-free Cool Whip.  We're going to have to start keeping track.  Yeah, but it's the combination of things.  It's a whole plate of celery.  It's a fucking whole thing of Cool Whip and a banana, and you're sitting there like that's  fucking normal.  No one's ever eaten that fucking combination on the planet of the fucking universe.  There's no fat-free peanut butter. 
[02:49:30]  On the planet of the fucking universe.  There's no fat-free peanut butter.  So what?  Eat a cigarette, shithead.  Oh.  Dip that in Cool Whip.  You're so mean so fast.  I want you to dip a cigarette in Cool Whip and light it and eat it.  Swallow it.  Listen.  I'm not going to try to fucking blow it, faggot.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  It's just...  I'm enjoying my...  Steve's girl.  From my party.  Is whipping me in her shape.  Yeah.  She told...  MJ told you to eat Cool Whip, celery, and a fucking banana with a spoon? 
[02:50:00]  MJ, yes.  Recommended fucking...  No, this is...  Oh, this is right there.  That's healthy, right?  Healthy for what?  Exactly.  A fucking baby goat?  Don't be mad because I'm having a fun snack and you don't.  Fun snack?  Why don't you eat your fucking phone in a lighter?  Shit.  I already had my breakfast.  I had egg whites.  Did you really?  Yeah.  So did I.  Like a human.  I had egg whites.  I got little baby chickadees and fried them up.  I had egg whites and I had a grapefruit, but that was hours ago.  So I didn't lay in bed like fucking De Niro and they were waking him up to take him 
[02:50:30]  to jail in Raging Bull.  I'm sorry.  My coattails didn't get a fucking radio show.  They couldn't.  You don't have coattails, fatso?  I'm not fat anymore, fatso?  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  You're not as fat.  I'll take my shirt off and you take your shirt off.  You look like Mr. Clean.  Shut up, stupid.  Let's take it off.  Oh, shit.  You look like Mr. Unclean.  Oh, yeah.  What do you have for lunch?  Pineapple and marshmallow peeps?  I like it. 
[02:51:00]  I like this.  That's because you look like a marshmallow peep.  That's why you like it.  All right.  Get back today.  Get back.  What's the odd combination?  We're breaking our own rule with David.  He's on the air now too much.  Sorry.  He hasn't said a word.  But you got some good dirt on him in.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just having conversations during the show on Facebook.  And I noticed, why haven't you made me a friend on Facebook, David?  Yes, I am.  You're on my page.  Jesus Christ.  No, I just went to yours and I couldn't get on because you're not. 
[02:51:30]  I requested you on the first day and you accepted.  The first day that me and Sam set up the account, I requested you.  You accepted, yeah.  Maybe I kicked him out to make room.  You might have done that, but I definitely did.  I requested you on the first day.  We don't converse, though.  No, that's true.  But I accepted you.  You're the same filth, though.  He's doing the Facebook for the chicks.  Yeah, it seems like he's trying to just talk to the girls on Facebook.  He requested your sister, Aunt, which is not respectful.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, my God.  New mom.  Are you into MILFs?  All right, David.  He's just staring at me.  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am.  Yeah, the clock is, the stopwatch is.  All right.  Let's go to Mike in Utah.  Mike gets a little credit today before the break.  Mikey.  Hey, how's it going?  Mike.  You created FatErock.com, huh?  Beautiful.  I did.  Dude, we're going to love this thing for the next few days.  But it's just going to make Eric feel fat.  He is fat. 
[02:52:30]  Nothing.  All right, David.  Mikey.  Yeah.  I guess that's all we can do with you.  I don't know what else to do.  I was just going to say, there's a thing on there.  You can just add and upload a picture, and it'll add FatErock to the bottom corner of it.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  That's all I got.  See you.  Bye.  Nice.  Let's take a break.  Yeah, I got to take a pee-pee. 
[02:53:00]  Danny was doing some research on FatErock.com and was very happy to pass this info on to everybody.  Yes, it's very, very easy.  If you don't have any Photoshop skills, there are none needed.  You just need a good photo, because what FatErock.com will do is automatically Photoshop in FatErock to your photo.  So I just made one.  Wow.  I just made one.  It took me two seconds.  This is my first submission to FatErock.com.  Wow.  It's a half-eaten man in the woods, and there's FatErock. 
[02:53:30]  Just got a chip nearby.  Like he just ate him.  Yeah, that's for sure.  And let's take the guy from fucking Grizzly Man.  Yeah.  Maybe it is.  Oh, look at the guy's leg.  His leg is eaten, and his dick is fucking hanging to the side.  That's a big black dick.  That's like that.  The fucking animal didn't want any part of that dick, though, huh?  The animal's probably just licking it and sitting on it. 
[02:54:00]  Just guessing.  Just guessing.  You never know.  Hey, Bob, why are you on television?  Did you catch that, Danny?  Yes, I did.  It's hysterically funny.  It's just a guy.  There he is.  A big Samoan guy.  Dude, you know what, dude?  I'm in jail, dude.  Why do you get thrown in jail?  Because your little fucker doesn't want to go to school.  Exactly.  Because you're supposed to parent.  You're going to juvie.  Parent.  All right. 
[02:54:30]  Over the weekend, I went through some radio boxes, and I found three letters where we  were getting yelled at when we were at AF.  Yeah.  And I did a little tweet with this shit, and people seemed to enjoy them.  So did you see these yet?  No, I haven't seen those.  All right, good.  I got three.  I don't even know why I had.  I opened up a folder in one of these boxes.  It's gold.  Because we've talked about this.  You're a hoarder.  I don't know if I'm a hoarder.  I do have a lot of our history, though, my friend.  You're going to appreciate it someday. 
[02:55:00]  Someday.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Probably not.  Someday in court.  Probably not.  But the regular listeners, they know all these characters.  Dave Douglas, we've called him Dave Dickless over the years.  Yes.  A former program director.  Weren't a big fan of Dave.  No.  He wanted to be the third member at the time of the Opie and Anthony show.  He did actually say that.  He sat us down and said, consider me the third member of the Opie and Anthony show where,  you know, run some stuff by me.  Yeah, run some stuff by me.  I could help out. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  And he's fallen on some bad times as Dave Douglas, but.  What happened?  He's not on radio anymore.  What happened?  He's just not on radio anymore, Bobby.  For the big gig?  He's just not on radio.  What happened?  Did he get in a plane crash?  I try not to kick people when they're down, believe it or not.  He's not kicking him.  He's saying he's got a job somewhere else.  He's always doing one of my things.  You give me a news story.  That's all.  I like news.  He came out with his own game called Jump to Conclusions.  It was.  My favorite fan was called Forgone Conclusions.  Forgone Conclusions. 
[02:56:00]  Also, you're going to hear the name Bruce.  That's good old Bruce Mittman, who is pretty much a midget.  That was our GM.  We had a love-hate relationship with this guy.  We loved the guy.  He put his neck on the line many times for us.  He ambushed the mayor.  Yes, he did.  I found that picture, too, by the way.  Really?  Ambushed the mayor.  When we did the mayor prank up in Boston, where we said the mayor died for April Fool's  and we ended up getting fired for it, Bruce panicked because he knew we were very important 
[02:56:30]  to him.  He actually ambushed the mayor with a photographer and literally jumped out of the bushes and  ran up to the mayor and put his hand out like, Mr. Mayor?  The mayor, and he was able to get his hand, photographer, got the shot.  The mayor didn't know whose hand he was shaking whatsoever.  Did the mayor drool on it?  And then they ended up getting that picture in papers, hoping that that would help our  situation.  What is this?  Wow.  That's how shitty fucking-  But that's how cool Bruce was. 
[02:57:00]  USA Network show.  But that's how cool he was.  He found the mayor's schedule and he handed him down and said, if I get a picture with  the mayor, maybe this will help my boys.  That also happened.  Some guy was trying to get fucking Sirhan Sirhan to throw off the radio.  It didn't work, obviously, but he tried.  But we liked Bruce.  Thought he could have paid us a little more.  But he was always there for us.  He was, right?  Did you guys get paid a lot in Boston and West?  Fuck no.  Fuck no.  I was making less than I was making in construction when I first went there.  Really? 
[02:57:30]  And I was making shit in construction.  Where did you live in Boston when you-  I lived in Ashland.  Ashland?  Right just south of Framingham.  Ugh.  In an apartment complex that was just overrun with Brazilians.  Nice.  Yeah, I was like the only white guy living there.  Yeah.  Toot the back.  Fascinating.  There were chickens running around.  No.  I'm not kidding.  Chickens.  Chickens?  Chickens.  In my apartment complex.  Chickens?  Chickens?  Yeah.  It's like the David and Bobo show.  You just interviewed the co-host. 
[02:58:00]  Chickens?  Bobo?  Yeah, there were chickens running around.  I was on the third floor because I wanted the high ground.  It was like the highest floor.  It was third floor.  They were like garden apartments kind of things.  Oh, just slums.  Slums.  And where'd you live up?  Slumdog Millionaire, right?  Yes.  Where'd you live up in Boston?  Uh, Wellesley.  Oh, that's the way he made.  There's a shitty part of Wellesley.  There is no shitty part of Wellesley.  I've lived near the high school.  Go there and check it out.  It was no big deal.  Were there black people in your neighborhood?  Hell no. 
[02:58:30]  That was the last time that there wasn't to, you know.  There's no black people in Boston.  Yeah, there is.  Go to Roxbury and Dorchester.  Exactly.  But everywhere else, no.  There was still a disparity in the pay rate at that point.  That's what I'm trying to get at.  That's what I'm saying.  I know.  I know.  That's exactly what you're trying to get at.  And you lived in fucking a third world country with chickens.  I had never done radio before.  Right.  So, you know, they said, all right, we got this show here, Afternoons.  It's like Opie, because he's been doing Opie, Nighttime Attitude on BAB. 
[02:59:00]  And then I'm just some schlep fucking tin knocker that came along for the ride.  And he was like, all right, we'll give you, you know, this.  And Bruce took advantage of that situation.  I can't.  I was just like, fuck it.  Okay, I'll do it for that.  I'll just have the fucking, you know, have to suck it up.  So things panned out.  Yeah, we did fine.  If you want to know the way the story ends, things panned out.  So I got this memo to the Opie and Anthony show from Bruce. 
[02:59:30]  Bruce Mittman, who we're talking about here, the little midger with the massive SUV, by the way.  June 30th, 1995.  Going back a ways.  95.  In reference to oral sex on the air.  I can't believe guys had to type these up.  Stop sucking each other's cocks when you're supposed to be doing a show.  Yesterday I heard you used the term blowjob during one of your phone bits. 
[03:00:00]  Whoa.  As you are well aware, this type of language could constitute an FCC fine.  WAF.  What were they back then?  Ten bucks?  Probably.  The fines.  The fines used to be a joke.  They encouraged it.  It doesn't matter.  It's a couple thousand.  It's worth it.  Yeah.  WAF, now it's what?  Three hundred and...  Three hundred and sixty thousand or something like that, if you're fucking...  WAF will not be responsible for a fine generated by your lack of common sense.  We invested in a delay system for this purpose. 
[03:00:30]  Please familiarize yourself with it.  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.  They wanted us to use our own dump button.  We had a delay with a dump button, and we were supposed to use it.  There wasn't a dump guy.  Right, so if we said something, if we decided it was a blowjob, we were then supposed to  dump out of it and go, oh, we should have said that.  Oh, shouldn't have said that.  How stupid are you, Bruce?  They learned really quickly that we shouldn't be doing our own dump button.  Oh, yeah.  Please familiarize yourself with it. 
[03:01:00]  You will not use terms like this or any other expletives in the future.  Signed, Bruce.  CC Dave Douglas.  CC Personal File.  CC Greg Hughes.  CC Anthony Cumia.  It went into our personal file?  Personal files.  It went into our personal files?  I would love to see that fucking personal file.  What the fuck's in there?  DTX wrote, I'd love to see this personal file.  It must be a warehouse.  Very good.  So that one is a little warm-up letter I found.  That's good.  And that was from Brucey.  Yeah.  This one is really good. 
[03:01:30]  This one is a three-pager.  Uh-oh.  Actually, not three pages.  It's in three pages here, so you can see it.  Who is it from?  Dave Douglas.  Dave Dickless.  This will show you what we were dealing with.  And he even had an initial of his name, Dave Douglas, even though he typed out Dave Douglas.  Oh, initial DD just to show that I actually did this.  Right.  To Opie and Anthony, he did not know how to spell my name, which is really good.  Why should he?  O-P-E-Y.  He's the fucking, like, supposed to be our boss and the fifth member of the Beatles.  Right.  And trust me, the name is spelled right on the website and other promotional material, but, 
[03:02:00]  you know, whatever, uh, from Dave Douglas, uh, reference show material.  I was very disappointed to hear one particular break on your program on Friday afternoon.  December 8th, 1995.  At around 5.55 p.m., you played back a phone call from a female listener who was responsible,  uh, who was responding to a bit that aired earlier in the day.  Opie carried on a conversation with her in a effeminate voice. 
[03:02:30]  Yes.  Did I say that right?  True to do.  And pretended to be a station intern who would give the message to Opie and Anthony.  All right.  This is one of our classic bits.  Yeah, we always had fun with the callers like that.  Right.  You make believe you're not the guy.  Someone else.  She actually tried to contribute something that could have been interesting to the show,  but shut up, you dumb motherfucker.  I know.  It's just like, how does he know?  Oh, how does he know?  Right.  What's fucking funny?  This was my biggest problem with him.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  He'd always look at something and go, you know, you could have done this with it.  Yeah.  And it might've gone in this direction.  It's like, shut up.  We fucking on a station where there's the 12 year olds listening.  Yeah.  We're making poopy and wee wee jokes.  Yeah.  Shut it.  Could have been interesting to the show, but Opie continued to dominate the conversation  by recapping the earlier bit called Fag Talk.  Okay.  I like Fag Talk.  What's wrong with that?  I do too.  Let's do Fag Talk again. 
[03:03:30]  Hi, Danny.  This gets better.  Although, because this leads to a whole thing with Dave Douglas.  He's going to tell us what's not acceptable on the radio show.  Although you made it clear that the comedy bit was based on the British term for a cigarette,  Fag.  Yes.  Portions of the bit, take it out of context, do cross the line of decency.  Specifically, I'm referring to the phrase, suck his dick.  All right. 
[03:04:00]  There was double entendre we were using then.  I do recall.  That's right.  He had detective lollipop.  All the replies to this, by the way, when I posted it.  Yeah.  The main reply, people were like, I can't believe someone actually had to type this  shit out.  Yes, you can't say, suck his dick.  Right.  They're like, when we get in trouble, it's like, could you please not park in the, you  know, no handicap zone, you know, we're going to get fined and blah, blah, blah.  But no, our boss has to write, suck his dick.  Don't say suck his dick. 
[03:04:30]  I'm referring to the phrase, suck his dick.  In the original version, the fact that the narrator had a British accent added some credibility  to the piece.  Did it?  No, no, it was a cop.  And frankly, it was the only reason I allowed you to air it at all.  Your version driven by a homosexual lisp like character.  It's a clever innuendo and dug it right into the gutter.  That's what we do. 
[03:05:00]  Or drug it.  That's what we do.  What are you supposed to do with that, right?  Into the gutter.  We stink.  In my opinion.  You don't think you keep it clever?  Never.  Clever rots.  Clever's for queers.  Clever this, faggot.  In my opinion, the airing of this call and its execution at 5.55 was pretty much in direct 
[03:05:30]  violation of an earlier order I had given regarding airing.  5.50.  That's how we were with this motherfucker.  He'd say something, we'd go right in and do the opposite.  Oh, we'd march, remember?  And he would pull his hair out like, put this.  I just told you.  And we're like, no, we thought you meant this.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now we'll be good.  Oh, we drove him nuts.  In my opinion, the airing of this call and its execution at 5.55 was pretty much in direct 
[03:06:00]  violation of an earlier order I had given regarding airing this bit just once.  And by speaking the phrase, suck his dick, I fucking love it.  Suck his dick, whether it is in context or not, is irresponsible on your part given the  recent conversations we have had about being too graphic.  Dude, how could you say that in any context where it works?  How does suck your dick ever fly under the radar? 
[03:06:30]  I believe the cigarettes, the fags, as it were, in England, were, it was fun to also  name your fags.  Right.  So one of the fags is named, like, John, and the other one is named Dick.  Right.  And it's like, you know, you suck this.  Well, get E-Rock.  We can get the fag talk.  It might sound hacky now, but we can play the one he's talking about.  We still have that disc somewhere.  Oh, it's Willie.  Yeah, you suck my Willie, and I'll suck your dick. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because it was called Willie and Dick.  Oh.  With a cigarette.  But they were fags.  It's like, yes, I'm calling my fag Dick.  Yeah.  And it's like, now you, here, you suck my dick.  Yeah, and you suck my Willie.  Right.  Oh, at least that's clever.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, yeah, exactly.  Because he says it was, right.  So where are we here?  Come on, this is around bra-bombing time, so.  Cut us some slack. 
[03:07:30]  I'm so glad I didn't listen to you in Boston.  Shut up, obese primate.  Well, he's just trying to cut him off.  He's talking about me, you fucking mushy asshole.  Go back to your texting, you fucking douche.  I'm not texting.  I'm looking at girls' pictures.  All right, listen.  He's going to find the one we're talking about here.  In my opinion, the airing of this call and its execution at 555 is pretty much in direct violation.  Okay, and by speaking the phrase, suck his dick, whether it is in context or not, is irresponsible on your part, given the recent conversation we had about being too graphic. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  You leave me no choice.  None.  But to, this is the best part.  Act like an idiot.  This is the big get right here.  No choice but to articulate this specific warning.  Warning.  If either of you, any characters you may create, or any caller on your program airs something of this nature again.  Of this nature.  Good.  That was vague enough right there for us.  All I needed was to hear of this nature.  Oh, I know.  And it opened up, like, this vagueness that it's like, oh, well, what did that mean? 
[03:08:30]  We just didn't give a shit.  No.  Like, again, I will suspend both of you for five consecutive work days without pay.  Vacation.  I call that.  That was called, I need a week off.  Yeah.  And this is where it's just amazing.  Someone has to type this up, who's, quote, your boss.  What specifically are we talking about?  Question mark?  Words and phrases like.  And it becomes a George Carlin bit.  Oh, here he goes.  Suck my dick, ass wipe, butthole, penis, hard-on, lick pussy, eat me, muff dive, nipple secretion. 
[03:09:00]  He wrote these down.  Tit cum shit, blowjob, cock, rectum, vagina, testicles, and scrotum, to name a few.  Just to name a few.  Hey, bet you got off of typing all that out.  Freaking out.  Remember when you were a little kid, you typed out dirty words?  I was like, oh, just look at the dirty word.  Oh, naughty, look at me.  That's a dirty word. 
[03:09:30]  I just typed out cunt.  My mommy's typewriter.  I have articulated my policy regarding the use of this kind of graphic language to the entire staff.  I believe I've made it clear that we all need to be more intelligent in using our communication skills.  AAF is a great radio station.  Is it?  Perhaps the best it's ever been.  Yeah.  How about you didn't fucking say that when you had that article in one of the radio magazines when they did a whole history of AAF?  I found that. 
[03:10:00]  And the motherfucker left us out completely.  Like Russian history.  It's like real.  Like Russian history.  Like Russian history.  We never worked there.  You were fired by that point?  Yeah, but he held such a grudge that they came to him because AAF really became this amazing station.  We were a giant part of making that station what it was.  It was the first show that beat BCN, which maybe a little too inside, never happened before it, and I did it.  So we were a big deal up there.  I love that.  So they went to him and said, we want to do a whole fucking magazine on AAF and the history. 
[03:10:30]  And we are now at NAW.  Someone sent a copy down.  There was one tiny little mention by the promotional director about something we, an event we did, but it took up maybe two sentences.  And this thing was at least 50 pages.  Wow.  Pictures and all sorts of shit.  And it was Dave that just fucking kept us out of it.  Who was the main guy that they did promote, like the main show?  Nah, they promoted all of them and all the rest of them.  Fucking Hillman ever.  Chipping mid-days.  I like the Hillman.  The Hillman's good.  Shut it.  He's a good guy.  Boy, you got gigs coming up? 
[03:11:00]  Zach, what's good about the Hillman?  Hillman, my ass.  I prefer the Valley Chap.  I wish there was a Valley.  Oh, you didn't say that.  There is a Valley.  The one created by that bomb.  Oh, my God.  You did not say that.  I'm never, ever remembering that you said that.  I'm going to say it for you again.  So I can respect you.  Valley Chap.  I've had about 15 massive duds.  There was one before I threw out, too. 
[03:11:30]  And it was like a fucking lead balloon just fucking tanked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, Melissa Mandak, our new traffic girl, number one on Google Trends.  Wow.  Cool.  We didn't even really Google bomb it.  We just sort of said if you want to see images of her.  Melissa, and then her last name is M-A-N-D-A-K.  Wow.  We didn't even Google bomb.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into that in a second.  Let me finish this.  So AF is a great radio station, perhaps the best it's ever been. 
[03:12:00]  The Opie and Anthony program is an important part of the success of this radio station.  A little more than an important part, asshole.  You're some of the most creative talents I've ever worked with.  Some of?  However, I cannot allow the entire radio station to suffer from any kind of legal action due  to your or anyone else's irresponsible behavior on the air.  Fuck off.  And then, my door is always open.  Should you need any clarification on this or any other concern?  I look forward to continuing discussions. 
[03:12:30]  Pungy sticks you up.  Fuck.  With you on how to develop and grow the show into the best it could be.  Yeah.  That sounded like it.  And this is a perfect ending to this.  So that was the second one I sent out to everybody.  The third one is short and to the point.  Uh-huh.  To the staff.  From Dave Douglas.  This was, I don't know, a few weeks, a couple months maybe after what I just read.  Referring suspension.  Oh, shit. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  As a result of certain remarks made recently,  Opie and Anthony have been placed on suspension until further notice.  If you have any questions regarding this, please feel free to ask me.  Classic.  We just made a listen.  Is that?  First, there's the suspension warning.  And shortly thereafter is the suspension. 
[03:13:30]  It's all laid out for us nice.  All we have to do is follow these little rules.  Yeah.  Did we actually say all this stuff on the air?  Like, suck my dick, ass wipe, burble, penis hard on, lick pussy.  Yeah, we were real good with that.  Lick pussy.  Vaginal.  Did we ever say nipple secretion?  Yeah, I'm sure we did.  Yeah.  I'm sure we did.  How great is that?  Fucking thrown right out the door.  Suspended until further notice.  So I found those.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  One of the boxes over the weekend. 
[03:14:00]  God, we didn't give a shit back then.  Fuck.  Wait, the suspension.  Wow, someone is actually.  Here, let me see.  Someone linga linga.  Opie, the suspension was dated like nine months before the warning.  Really?  All right, wait.  March 15th, 96.  No.  Okay, no.  And then December 8th, 95.  So December 8th, 95 obviously comes first.  So it was three months later.  We got suspended.  Three months after that.  Hey, we were good for three months? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, then.  But then we come back from suspended.  Wait.  Oh, June 30th, 1995 was the blowjob incident that Bruce had to write about.  And then, okay.  And then about six months later, the big letter from Dave.  And then three months later, the suspension.  Yeah.  One of, I think, we lost track, but we got fired once.  Suspended.  A lot of times.  They thought, everyone thought it was a bit like, oh, they do, these radio guys, whenever  they go on vacation, they do a fake suspension to try to get publicity. 
[03:15:00]  Right.  And it used to infuriate me when people said that, because it's like, no, they threw us  the fuck out.  My favorite fake suspension story, and I think it was Rocco, but I'm not positive where he's  like, of course.  He got suspended.  And he's like, dude, I'm stealing the AF rock bus.  Dude, I'm stealing the rock bus.  That's right.  He got suspended.  He said he got suspended.  He wasn't happy with management, so he stole the rock bus and just started driving around  the Boston area.  Broadcasting.  Broadcasting, by the way.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  Because, you know, he...  Because he could put the boom up fucking 50 feet and drive around and broadcast.  I'm like, great.  This guy's going to make our suspensions look ridiculous.  Look like they're fake.  We're actually getting suspended.  Yeah, and he's doing fake suspensions.  Fake suspensions, which means everyone looks at us and goes, oh, fake suspension again,  boys.  I bet I'm going to be suspended for the week between Christmas and New Year's.  It was always that.  It's suspicious.  Yeah, 4th of July weekend when every radio guy in the world takes off.  Dude, I don't care if I'm suspended.  I'm Rockhole, the rebel. 
[03:16:00]  And there he was fucking taking his vacation, saying that he's stealing the rock bus.  What a hack.  But how do they confuse the suspensions?  Him stealing a bus and you saying lick a cunt over the nerves.  Well, Jimmy, thank you for that because I don't understand myself.  That was something.  Oh, we don't have the fag talk you're talking about.  I bet you Dave took it and fucking pounded it up his ass.  We'll play one of the fag talks for us there, Derek.  Derek. 
[03:16:30]  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello.  Welcome to another edition of Fag Talk, the show where we talk about fags, or as they  call them in America, cigarettes.  Let's not waste any more time.  Let's bring out Bob the Fag Man.  Bob, welcome to the show.  Thank you.  It's wonderful to have you here.  It's a wonderful thing to be here.  And what a wonderful subject it is today as I looked over the notes before the show.  Right.  And it's sharing a fag into your bed.  After you've just made it up.  Right.  And that's explained.  Right.  You're with your spouse, your significant other, or your boy or girlfriend, whichever  it may be.  And afterwards, after that intimate moment. 
[03:17:00]  Right.  What better way than to share a fag with your lover?  Exactly.  Pull a fag into bed and suck on it together.  What you've got to do is keep a fag nearby.  Right.  Pre-arrange this, you know.  In the room.  Right.  Right.  After you're done, say to your lover, would you like to share a fag with me?  It's very, very important to ask your lover, especially if you're not that familiar.  Maybe this is a first girl.  That's right.  You don't want to scare them.  So you just say, would you mind if we brought a fag into the bed for us to suck on?  To suck on together.  You know, I'll suck a little, you suck a little, I'll suck you, suck back and forth. 
[03:17:30]  Right, suck.  It's not like a roll over and go to sleep.  No, no, no.  There's one more thing.  Let's have a fag between us.  It's the one common ground that we all have is enjoying a good suck on a fag.  Suck on that fag.  Love the fag.  Enjoy the fag together.  Suck.  You fag or suck.  Right.  Pass it over to your lover.  Let your lover suck on the fag.  And back to you.  It's wonderful.  It's very intimate.  Oh, yes, it is.  It's been a wonderful show.  Very nice.  Oh, Bob, thank you so much for being here. 
[03:18:00]  And join us again.  We're out of time.  Next time, right here.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you so much.  Get it?  You know, and Dave's saying that they did it more clever than us.  Okay.  Shut the fag up.  Just suck on the fag.  Who was that?  It was a comedy troupe.  I don't know.  They had a whole series of these.  Just suck.  Suck on the fag.  Suck on the fag.  Pass it over to your lover.  And just suck on the fag.  That wasn't you.  I thought it was you two.  Oh, hell no.  What are you kidding?  I was trying to figure out which one was Opie, which one was Ant.  You want to hear another one? 
[03:18:30]  Who wouldn't at this point?  Why not?  They're so bad.  They're good.  Give me another fag talk.  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello.  Welcome once again to fag talk.  Here comes the joke.  And I must explain something.  We're on in America now.  Uh-oh.  And we'd like to welcome our American audience, except for the one thing.  There seems to be some confusion with the cards and letters we're getting from the states,  which say that fag is actually a word used for something else there.  And, of course, we're talking about cigarettes.  Cigarettes.  So let's get right to it. 
[03:19:00]  Welcome to Fag Man.  Bob the Fag Man is here.  Right.  Welcome on the show.  You've brought some lovely fags.  Let's see what you've got.  I've brought some great fags this week.  This one right here is from Russia.  Grab the butt of that fag right there.  Right, okay.  I've got the butt right here.  I'm grabbing the butt of this fag.  Slide that fag right in your mouth.  Right.  I mean, slide the fag right in my mouth.  Now, I've got the fag.  Suck on that fag.  That's a great fag.  I love this one.  Now, take a look at this fag right here.  It's much bigger than all the other fags.  That's a big fag, you know.  It's a very large fag.  It's a firm fag.  Let me feel that. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, I like the way that feels.  It's just like a fondle, this fag, right in my fingers here.  You can fondle that fag for days.  And it's a big one.  It's big and it's hard.  If you want to go to a different way, you can go with a small fag.  Oh, look at that little fag.  That's a fucking tiny little fag.  Look at you, little fag.  Come here.  Oh, yeah.  I like the taste of that one and I like sucking on that fag.  So, those are three for today.  That's wonderful.  Thank you so much for being here.  Bob, the fag man's been on the show.  Join us again next time when Bob and I visit a fag party.  Nothing but fags and drinks.  It's going to be wonderful.  All fags, all the time, right here on Fag Talks. 
[03:20:00]  Well, my shit is that.  You like the subtlety of it, Tim?  Are they really British?  No.  I just love all those sucking dick jokes they can come up with.  Suck on the fag.  That bit's fucking horrid.  I'm grabbing a fag and shoving it in my asshole.  You wouldn't do this with a cigarette.  A fag.  Robert, where are you going to be?  Oh, fucking.  We're going to play one more, but.  Are you going to do one more?  Yeah, going to the break.  They're too good not to.  Oh, fuck me, dude.  That fucking aggravated me. 
[03:20:30]  It does.  It made me angry.  It annoys me.  It fucking bugs me.  I want to hear another one.  Fucking.  There was someone around going, oh, it sounded great.  I'm going to be this Thursday through fucking Sunday.  Shit.  Oh, wow.  That's a lot of days there.  Where you going to be, Bobby?  I'm going from February 26th to March 1st.  Holy shit.  Chicago Improv for tickets, 847-240-2001.  Right on.  Yeah, Chicago Improv.  Actually, when we say for the week, I'm actually there for the fucking whole week. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You want to play one more?  You want to break?  Oh, man.  One more fact.  Yeah.  I want to hear another one.  Definitely.  One more fact.  Fucking pisses me off.  You guys, thumbs up or down over there on the bleachers?  Fucking.  They're like, look at me.  They're all just thumbs down and eh.  Horrible.  They were so much better when they were on earth.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Were we?  Because I don't even think we did this with sarcasm, by the way. 
[03:21:30]  I think we're like, oh, wow.  We can play this.  We'll get some wax and we'll get away.  We'll do it with something, man.  One more fag talk as we go to break.  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello.  Welcome to the fag talk, the show where we talk about fags, or as they call them in America,  cigarettes.  Today, we've got a wonderful show and let's not waste any time.  Let's bring out Bob the fag man.  Bob.  Thank you.  Welcome to the show.  Thank you.  Now, I said let's not waste any time as if we were in a hurry.  We are.  But we are in a hurry. 
[03:22:00]  Right.  To wait.  Right.  Explain that for us.  What it is today is we want you to take time out and enjoy your fag.  You know what I like to do?  What's that?  Yes, take the end, you know.  Right.  Just the tip.  Right.  Just slowly bring it to me lips.  Right.  And then take my tongue.  Right.  And just give it a little lick.  Right.  And then suck.  And it's so nice.  Right.  So a quick review.  Right.  Respect your fag.  Get to know your fag.  Lick your fag's butt.  And then suck it. 
[03:22:30]  Okay.  Wonderful show, Bob.  Again, thank you so much for being here on Fag Talk.  Join us again next time.  Right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
