<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and Anthony recounting their experiences playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, detailing their virtual gang warfare, motorcycle races, gym sessions, and missions.  They played humorous audio clips from the game, notably a suggestive commercial for "Glory Hole Theme Park." Listener calls followed, sharing their own GTA exploits, including piloting stolen planes and using in-game chainsaws, with one caller even mentioning finding sex toys in the game. Jim Norton revealed a computer virus infection from a fake Eminem album email, prompting discussion with Steve, the tech guy, about repairs and computer upgrades.  A comedic audio montage featuring Donald Trump's voice overlaid on political speeches by John Kerry and George W. Bush was played, followed by a bit on "America's sexiest state."  A segment about Rich Voss's comedy show followed, with callers criticizing Voss for repeatedly taking calls from his girlfriend, Bonnie, during his performance. Voss called in to defend himself, leading to further discussion of his relationship. Norton shared a story about his intense body odor ("swamp ass"), and Anthony recounted throwing his foul-smelling underwear out the window.

The next segment started with a humorous anecdote about a misdial, leading to discussion about Voss's girlfriend's breasts and the hosts' poor seating at a Donald Trump roast.  Voss called in again, continuing the roast seating discussion.  The conversation escalated to a suggestion for a live on-air sex act, which was accepted by Adam and Arielle from Sacramento.  They proceeded to have sex on air, describing their actions and preferences as the hosts provided commentary. Pictures were promised online.  Following the sex act, California was declared "the sexiest state" due to this event.  Listener calls reacting to the sex act were interspersed with a discussion of a truck driver job opening (featuring a colorful applicant), commentary on the presidential election results (including Kerry’s concession and Bush’s victory speeches), and various audio clips, including more Donald Trump recordings.  The hosts reflected on their past radio experiences and the financial realities of divorce and alimony.

The following segment opened with Anthony detailing his near-bankruptcy due to his ex-wife withdrawing $40,000 before their divorce. This sparked a discussion about unfair divorce laws, using graphic and offensive language, including racial slurs and misogynistic remarks. The conversation veered into commentary on the O.J. Simpson trial. This was followed by an interview with Rich Everett, author of *Air Crashes That Filled Rock and Roll Heaven*, detailing various rock star plane crashes (Randy Rhoads, Lynyrd Skynyrd, John Denver, Otis Redding).  Listener feedback was overwhelmingly negative, prompting profane commentary from the hosts.

The show continued with a discussion of a previous segment’s technical difficulties. Erica ("Couch Lady"), whose appearance had been delayed by an anxiety attack, arrived in the studio.  She discussed her closed antique shop, leading to an examination of a love seat ("lesbian couch") she brought, revealing what appeared to be semen stains.  Erica discussed postponing her wedding with Ben due to financial difficulties.  She presented gifts, one of which Opie accidentally broke, causing Erica distress.  Following this incident, the hosts discussed Jim Norton's past cocaine use and related sexual fantasies.  Listener calls followed, commenting on the Erica incident, which concluded the segment.

The final segment heavily featured "How's Your News," a news program hosted by people with intellectual disabilities.  The hosts repeatedly used the word "retard" to describe the participants.  They played several audio clips, highlighting celebrity interviews (James Carville, Peter Jennings, Al Franken, Rob Reiner) and Triumph the insult comic dog.  A listener, Doris, called in and was abruptly disconnected, leading to a call from Frank expressing anger at the hosts’ treatment of Doris. The show concluded with a brief segment about a debt collection call and a promotional clip featuring Bob Edwards and Doc Watson.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts mentioned several other planned segments with various guests, including Chris Rock, and  references were made to O.J. Simpson and various musicians. Technical difficulties and dead air were recurring issues.

[00:00:30]  This now concludes the O&A Variety Hour. 
[00:01:00]  Stay tuned for the Opie and Anthony Show, spreading across America.  It's the O&A Virus. 
[00:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show, spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony Show, spreading across America.  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Hello? 
[00:06:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  Smoke weed every day.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  I don't care how many Dago, Gary, Watt, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  The phone lines are going berserk.  Uh, no, they're not.  No, they're not.  You're just a tool.  Uh, no, I'm not.  You can keep your hands off of my mule. 
[00:06:30]  I'm not touching your mule.  Your mule.  You have a mule?  I gotta go.  I remember that one.  I remember that one.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  You're witnessing the greatest comeback in radio history, slowly but surely.  Wow.  Never thought of it that way.  Slowly but effing surely.  We will be back on top again.  Right, Anthony? 
[00:07:00]  Creeping along.  Oh, we are creeping along.  But getting more gooder every day.  Much more gooder.  I gotta tell you, man.  You just brought up a good point just before we, uh, crack the mics as they say in the business.  I did?  I'm with you today, man.  I got a lot of sleep last night and I'm really freaking tired.  I'm more exhausted today than I have been on nights where I've gotten three hours sleep.  And last night, nine o'clock.  You went to bed at nine? 
[00:07:30]  So did I.  No, I was in bed.  I was in bed at six o'clock.  Really?  Six o'clock, but I was playing GTA because I got it hooked up in the bedroom.  You know, I was playing GTA as well.  And it was getting to that point where I was going to spend like three hours.  You know when you're playing your video game and you can take a little peek at the video game.  Like, yeah, I'm just going to play for five, ten minutes as I wait for this phone call or wait for my delivery for dinner, what have you.  We'll put a little time in.  And the next thing you know, you look at the clock and an hour went by. 
[00:08:00]  And then it gets to that point where you really have to just cut yourself off or it's over, Johnny.  But you usually go, oh, one more mission.  Yeah, one more mission.  Just do one more.  I'll try to get through this.  If I just slowed the car down a little bit, I could have completed the drive-by mission.  No, I've got to try it again.  And the next thing you know, you're trying it 20 other times.  You're doing the drive-by one?  Yeah, I'm way behind you.  Because I'm spending a lot of time with this GTA San Andreas just, you know, getting on motorcycles and seeing how fast I can go.  It gets frightening when you get up to full speed.  Yeah, I know, I know. 
[00:08:30]  That's pretty cool.  But, you know, I do believe with this GTA, I do believe my character is getting dragged back into the gang violence.  Oh, really?  Do you see that happening?  Yeah, something's going on.  My guy, you know, he got out of prison or what have you.  The cops dropped him off in a really bad neighborhood.  I jumped on my bike and I got back to my hood with all my old homies.  You're hanging out with the wrong crowd.  And I'm thinking, you know, I'm going to turn my life around.  Sure you are.  And I'm slowly but surely getting pulled back in, it seems.  You didn't take the option where you can go to college? 
[00:09:00]  See, I took the option where I went to college and I'm just trying to get my grades up and do well.  How funny would that be?  They have that option where instead of doing all these cool missions and doing drive-bys and spray-painting tags and getting buff and getting your colors on,  there's an option where you just sit in a classroom and listen to a boring professor.  That's what I'm doing.  I hit the button and all of a sudden I take out my book.  My book comes out of my book bag and I start reading.  It's a lot of fun and I think I'm making a better life for my character. 
[00:09:30]  Quite frankly, I don't blame the homies for going for the quick fix in their lives.  Of course.  Sell a few drugs, the money goes up.  But my guy, all of a sudden, he's like, he's got colors now, man.  Yeah, yeah, you get the colors.  I wound up getting the haircut, the colors.  But I also went to the gym.  I concentrated a lot on the gym.  And when I logged on last night, I didn't even recognize my character.  I was like, who is that?  Dude, I'm an animal.  I am an animal.  I'm huge, all buff. 
[00:10:00]  I got the muscles all the way up on the level because I just kept going back to the gym whenever I could, working out.  Yeah, this is an option where you just get bigger.  Yeah, I'm a huge animal now.  So what I did last night, I spent a lot of time just going around and punching people in the face and robbing them.  I could kick people's ass.  Now, two punches and they're on the floor.  And then like one stomp and they're dead.  So I'm killing people like really quickly.  See, I wasted too much time on the motorcycles because when I fight people, it takes forever to knock them out.  No, you get buffed.  Now I'm an animal.  I'm killing people so quick. 
[00:10:30]  And then did you get the knife?  You got a knife?  You could walk up to people as they're talking to other people.  You grab them from behind and slit their throat.  It takes like a second.  Well, I found the chainsaw, which is...  Oh, chainsaw.  I haven't found that yet.  The chainsaw, which makes it a lot easier.  What a great weapon.  Right through them.  Dead.  Yo, man, what you doing?  Yeah, but I can't get enough of this GTA.  And we got the commercials, Anthony.  Oh, not...  We don't have the lines that we spoke?  Not yet. 
[00:11:00]  Got to find those somewhere.  I know.  We got cameos in GTA.  We're like callers to a talk show.  I was talking to Laszlo.  He's going to be on the show soon.  He put together all the audio.  He put together all the audio for GTA.  And he said that these commercials and stuff only run once.  They have so much information in this game as far as all the radio channels that you're  only going to hear these fake commercials and other things only once in the game.  Really?  Because it's going to cycle through.  Yeah.  So I was playing the other day and they had fake commercials for this theme park called 
[00:11:30]  Glory Hole Theme Park.  Yeah, Laszlo was saying a lot of the stuff on here is pretty rank.  Glory Hole Theme Park.  And I'm like not really listening to the radio because a lot of times when the commercials  come on just like regular radio, you kind of zone out.  But in this game, you got to listen to the commercials.  The music is just really, really cool.  And then I think it was Rage.  Rage Against the Machine ends.  And all of a sudden they had this commercial for Glory Hole Theme Park.  And all of a sudden it piqued my interest.  Like what the F is this?  So we got a copy of it to play for you today on the show. 
[00:12:00]  Very cool.  You want to check it out?  Yeah.  From GTA.  This is Glory Hole Theme Park.  Listen to this.  Come live the mystery.  Glory Hole.  Glory Hole.  Where strangers become friends.  Glory Hole.  You don't need to know names.  Cool off in our water sports park.  I'll show your kids a great time.  It's something they'll never forget and talk about for years to come.  Especially at therapy sessions.  It's the place for magic and adventure. 
[00:12:30]  Glory Hole.  Leaving me free to shop and get lipo.  Who's ready for the Incredible Dribble's voyage?  Jerry, can we come too?  This is a journey you must undertake alone.  It can be dark and scary as you'll shriek with delight.  Glory Hole.  Talk about scary.  What's that hole in the wall for?  You wait and see.  You'll be amazed.  Fuck this.  I'm sorry.  Glory Hole.  Glory Hole Theme Park.  Open every day till 3 a.m.  That's hilarious.  Glory Hole. 
[00:13:00]  Glory Hole Theme Park.  What's that hole in the wall for?  Oh, man.  An adventure you've got to take alone.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let's, uh...  Oh, wait.  I have to go this way today.  Okay.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  We're getting the show together today.  Nice.  Well, hey, I jumped the fence at the airport and I got the plane.  Oh, you jumped the fence.  Damn it.  I haven't figured out how to get in there yet.  You could jump over everything now.  Yeah.  Or climb.  In this game, you could climb. 
[00:13:30]  See, because I'm waiting to legitimately open up the road so I can start driving into some  of these other areas.  Right.  I heard Steve C. said he swam from one zone to another.  Yeah, he could swim.  The climbing feature is great.  Absolutely great.  So you've got a plane in the game?  Yeah.  It's like the regular plane.  You can fly.  But get this.  I crossed over into the area you're not supposed to go.  Yeah.  And a jet got scrambled and it shot me out of the...  Like a fighter jet.  And you got shot down? 
[00:14:00]  Shot my ass out of the sky.  You were over the no-fly zone, I think.  Oh, right on.  Exactly.  All right.  And there's...  I also have a...  A fuck.  A big...  Bigfoot truck.  Like a Stomper.  Huge truck.  Yeah.  That's in there, too.  All right.  And a girlfriend.  You get a girlfriend, too.  You get a girlfriend eventually?  I don't need no bitch.  I need no bitches.  I need my homies.  It sucks because you can't do anything because she keeps like...  Like...  You keep having to go back and spend time with her or her. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, my God.  It's like real life.  Jesus.  Are you talking about the game?  Yeah, exactly.  The game.  I finally just shot her in the head and said, screw it.  Exactly.  You wish you could do that in real life.  God.  This is a freaking video game.  How about they give you a girlfriend that gives you BJs whenever you want?  Thank God.  You have to take her on dates before she'll do anything with you.  I haven't got there yet.  Come on, man.  This is a game.  Maybe that gets you sex.  Not the real life.  Does that get your sex appeal up, though? 
[00:15:00]  Hey, yeah.  My sex appeal's up, but also I've increased my pimp level to the maximum, and the horse  pay me now to sleep with them.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You're like a gigolo in the game now?  Yeah.  You have to run like a pimp mission.  Oh, and then all of a sudden you're a pimp, so now the horse has got to give you money.  That's hilarious.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  I haven't seen that yet.  All right.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you later.  Thank you.  Let's go to David in L.A.  Cool.  L.A. is awake.  They haven't gone to bed yet.  What's up, David?  Oh, hell no.  How are you guys doing this morning? 
[00:15:30]  I'm doing good.  We're all doing well.  First thing I want to say is it's awesome to have you guys back on the radio.  I've been going nuts for two years.  Oh, cool.  Thanks, David.  I heard you guys are back.  I actually was in San Piero playing around on the GTA and heard the very last bit of  your guys' cameo.  Really?  And I was like, damn it.  And I was just like, shit, I just missed the whole thing.  And I've been trying and trying and trying to hear it, but I haven't heard it again yet.  I think we're only on the game once.  I think it just cycles through.  We're going to have to ask Laszlo about that.  He's going to be on the show soon, and I guess he'll bring in our cameos. 
[00:16:00]  That would be cool.  Hell yes, we hear the whole thing, but other than that, guys, you guys are awesome.  I'm glad you guys are back, and y'all keep rocking.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  A couple more of these real fast.  Let's go to Nick in Tampa.  Hey, Nick.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  What do you got?  Not much.  I was playing GTA yesterday.  I went to the inside track betting thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they had one of the horses.  The horses' names are hysterical, but one of them was called Reeves Revenge.  Have you guys seen that yet?  No, not yet.  You got to go to the inside track betting thing. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, but what?  Yeah, what does that have to do with anything?  It has nothing to do with nothing.  Wow.  It's funny, though.  Reeves Revenge?  All right.  Whatever.  All right.  Am I missing something?  Christopher Reeves?  Oh, Reeves Revenge.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but I don't...  Rob from Long Island.  What's up?  Oh, I got you.  Okay, now I understand.  I'm a little slow this morning.  Yeah, we apologize for that last call.  I forgot he was paralyzed from falling off a horse.  I didn't know he was saying Reeves.  That's awful.  One more.  Rob from Long Island.  How you doing, guys?  Well, the game is awful on... 
[00:17:00]  That is just horrible.  On many accounts there.  Go ahead, Rob.  All right.  My brother's been playing this game a lot.  I don't have time, but I've been watching him.  He said that that double-ended dildo that you find in the police station, that's for your  girlfriend.  And you find other vibrators and shit, and you go out with her, and you do missions and  shit.  And I was watching him the other day.  There's...  If you go to the highest building in the city, if you bring your motorcycle up there, there's  a parachute, and you can base jump off the building.  Oh, nice.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, it's so fucking cool, man.  If you take your motorcycle up there, you can ramp off the building, and then jump off  the motorcycle and get a crazy, insane thump bonus.  Awesome.  It's unbelievable, the things that you see in this fucking game.  Yeah, we're just scratching the surface, you know?  I absolutely love these games, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.  Oh, another thing.  Your buddy Voss is going to be playing a bowling alley this weekend over in Suffolk County.  This guy's so fucking money hungry.  It's unbelievable.  Is he really playing a bowling alley?  Yeah, Wildwood out in Suffolk County. 
[00:18:00]  Me and my friend are going...  Well, not this weekend.  Next Friday.  Me and my friend are going out there to see him.  All right.  We got a report on Rich Voss we're going to get into in a few minutes here.  Thanks, Rob.  No problem.  All right.  Before we move on from the GTA, there's another version of the Glory Hole Theme Park commercial  I want to play here.  Let's check this out.  San Andreas just can't get enough of the Glory Hole Theme Park.  Glory Hole.  We're strangers, big young friends.  Glory Hole.  You don't need to donate.  It's the place for magic and adventure. 
[00:18:30]  We all like speaking rodents to entertain and educate our kids, and now with Jerry Turbill,  the kids have someone they can really relate to.  Kids, come and play.  Hey, I've got puppies to show you.  Yay, it's our speaking rodents.  Go on, kids.  Have fun.  I know it's safe.  Jerry's wearing a latex bodysuit.  See you later, Mom.  We're off to have fun with strangers.  Glory Hole.  We're off to have fun with you.  We're off to have fun with you.  We're off to have fun with you.  We're off to have fun with you.  Ride the log flume.  Live the adventure of the flaming scream machine. 
[00:19:00]  Glory Hole Theme Park.  Glory Hole.  Open every day till 3 a.m.  Come live the mystery.  Come live the mystery.  That is really great.  That's brilliant, man.  Bravo off to GTA.  So, anyway, so we're a little tired, I guess.  You want to buy a dryer, door?  I was wondering what you were setting up over there.  Yeah, a little goofing on, boss.  Oh, that's hilarious. 
[00:19:30]  Hold on.  I have to take a call from Bonnie.  Oh, man.  Don't throw that at me.  These are teeth, not pins.  Oh, our good buddy, Rich.  That is hilarious.  Anyway, Norton said...  Norton barely made the beginning of the show.  Oh, my God.  These headphones still aren't working.  Go in the other jack, Jack.  Norton, say hi while I switch this over. 
[00:20:00]  How you doing, Jimmy?  My headphones are going out, too.  I'm so tired and miserable today.  Yeah, you really had a tough time sleeping, did you?  I laid there.  I had the busiest day of the month so far for me today, and I just laid there and itched.  Were you a little twitchy last night?  Every time I tried to doze off, my foot would itch.  And then, like, I would just be ready to sleep.  And then my titty itches.  Everything on me.  You'd get, like, an itch?  Everything on me.  I just got one right now.  Like, I was just a little...  What's wrong with you?  I'm probably dry skin from the stupid winter. 
[00:20:30]  You got any psoriasis already?  No, no, no, no.  I don't have anything weird.  And I know there's a lot of calls saying I have crabs, but I don't.  I was tired and I couldn't sleep.  I had a dream.  I finally fell asleep, and I had a dream that MTV threw me a birthday party, and Black Sabbath  came.  You are really sad.  And I didn't get my picture with them.  This is what Jim Norton dreams about?  Yeah, I'm 36, and that's what I dreamt last night.  Having little kid dreams.  Yeah.  Teen dreams.  Black Sabbath showed up, and I didn't get my picture, and I was like, where's the band?  And they're like, they just left. 
[00:21:00]  That's pathetic.  I'm a complete zero.  I get twitchy sometimes when I'm really tired and have to go to sleep, and it annoys  the crap out of you.  You're just at that point where you're ready to doze off.  You're feeling all relaxed, comfortable.  And then your leg just flies out from under you.  It pisses you off.  You got to fluff your pillow up, look at the clock, and count how many hours you'd get  if you fell asleep right now.  And then you...  Boom!  And then the arm goes out from under you.  I piss off.  Now, like I said, I got plenty of sleep, but I'm very tired. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, guys.  What are you talking about?  How sleepy we are.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I had to fix the headphone problem there.  How are your headphones working?  This jack works fine.  All right.  So you were at the benefit last night?  Did we talk about that?  No.  Yeah, there was a...  Yeah, because my stupid car battery isn't working, so I'm in the garage.  I'm blocking cars, and I have to get jumped.  And the little...  You got to get a jump?  What year is your car?  It's brand new.  Then why are you getting...  You should never have to crack the hood.  And your battery is dead.  It's three years old. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  I shouldn't say brand new.  It's three years old.  It probably has AIDS.  Your car has AIDS.  It probably has a parasite, like my computer.  It's not a parasite.  It's a virus.  No, it says on my computer that I have a parasite.  That's a type of virus.  My computer is so old, I got to get a new one today, which is fine.  Well, you just download anything and open it.  You don't virus...  You know what happened?  You don't have a virus check on there.  You don't have a...  Somebody got me really good.  One of the listeners.  I think it's an enemy of the show, actually.  No, this thing's going around.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, it's a big one.  All right, listen. 
[00:22:30]  And this is how it happened.  So I wake up, and I go right to the computer to check the Opie and Anthony email.  And, you know, I'm clicking around.  I've been up for five minutes.  It's like 3.45 in the morning.  And also, one of the emails says, Eminem's new album leaked.  That's the one.  I got that one.  You guys don't open it, man.  Did you open it, Ben?  No, I didn't open it.  No, I got it here, though.  I just got that, too.  No, no, just delete it, man.  This one is a bad one.  Get Steve in here.  It's a biggie.  So, you know...  Why would you open that?  They wouldn't be sending that to computers. 
[00:23:00]  Well, you know what?  The last Eminem album, that's exactly what happened, though.  Someone sent that to us, and we pretty much...  We broke the new Eminem album.  We got, like, national exposure.  We were all over MTV and VH1.  It was a huge story.  And so I'm like, oh, this is interesting.  And I click on it.  What are you going to do?  Oh.  Where is Martini, Steve?  I don't know where he is.  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  I like when he starts talking first, and then you hit it.  All right.  Steve?  Hi.  There he is.  I like interrupting. 
[00:23:30]  When he starts talking, you interrupt him.  So the subject is Eminem's new album leaked.  So I just click on it to read the email.  That's all I did on this one.  And my computer went absolutely nuts.  Pop-ups galore.  Oh, yeah.  I can't shut anything down.  It just went nuts.  Wait a minute.  You must have downloaded something.  I don't think I did.  Unless I was really...  You have to download it.  You have to.  You can't just open an email.  The thing is this.  You've got to be careful.  It's entirely possible the guy, whoever it was, sent you an actual link to...  The Eminem album. 
[00:24:00]  But those things are usually loaded on French, Turkish, Italian, MP3 portal sites that aren't  subject to any of this RIA litigation.  Ooh.  So what they do is...  And there's also no policing the spyware and viruses they load up on their servers either.  So you one-click, and you'll get loaded up with spyware, viruses, and all kinds of...  But he's saying he just opened his email and got this.  Now, that usually doesn't happen.  You click the link.  I don't think I did.  AOL has an automatic link protector.  So you can't just click... 
[00:24:30]  You have to click and say allow links.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right.  But maybe you hit the link when you open the button.  I have no idea.  Because you're probably anxious.  You're tired of the Lopey hitting buttons.  Yeah, I just screwed up my whole computer, though, because now it's like...  It's not even...  I can't use anything on it.  And they're like...  Time to get rid of the old 486, is it?  Yeah.  I don't have a 486.  Do I?  He's got a little penny, too.  I know.  Your computer stinks.  Dude, you should just throw it away.  It's garbage.  I understand.  We've got to order a new one today.  It's really trash.  Parasite got me bad.  What kind of video card you got in that thing? 
[00:25:00]  It's an old stock Dell, you know, like...  I don't know.  But be careful as Eminem album...  It's smoking just running the monitor.  Be careful with this Eminem album leak email that's going around.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  I mean, it just destroyed my computer, I think.  You just got to open it and then hit Find File and then right-click and virus scan it before you open it.  That's what I got.  Well, thanks.  Not just you...  It's too late now.  I don't think he's got any type of virus scan on his...  You have it through AOL, but you were just on Explorer, right? 
[00:25:30]  No, I got the Norton.  Norton 78?  It's disabled, though, isn't it?  I don't know what's going on.  Of course you don't.  We took an afternoon one day.  We took six hours to go through his virus-ravaged hard drive.  Oh, I remember the last time he got a virus on his computer.  I have more viruses than a crack whore on this thing, man.  It's just brutal.  Shankers on his monitor.  Oh, without a doubt.  Losing pustules.  There's so much crap growing on the monitor, I can't even see the monitor anymore.  Couldn't even install Norton without the thing crashing. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Couldn't even install it to look for viruses.  So he probably has some remnant of Norton antivirus on there, but it doesn't really do much.  No, just throw that thing away.  Well, we're going to get a new computer today, Anthony.  We'll get you a new computer.  Are you getting a new computer, Ope?  Why not?  Going to get a new one.  Going to get a new one.  According to the New York Times article, you're a multi-millionaire entertainer.  I think you should go out and purchase yourself a brand new computer.  Well, you can't believe everything you read in the New York Times.  What operating system does your computer use?  Uh...  Uh...  98.  Is it 98? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  You still have 98 on your computer.  Uh...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm not...  Do viruses even go on 98 anymore?  Yes, they toy with them before they ravage them completely and bleed them dry.  I am...  Wow.  I don't know.  I think it has the Ebola virus or something, though.  You don't like change, do you?  No, I do.  It just takes forever.  Wait till you boot up XP.  You're going to hate it.  Yeah.  This is not what I'm used to.  That's fine.  This looks different.  I'm ready to move into the year 2000. 
[00:27:00]  Let's go.  2000, exactly.  Let's go.  Windows Millennium.  Let's go.  You're ready.  So...  Now, you're going to be a little...  You might get a little sticker shock.  My brother asked me...  He goes, dude, order me a computer.  So I order him a computer.  And it came out to a couple of grand.  Now, the computers that they advertise on sites like, you know, Dell.  You go to Dell and they'll advertise a computer that you can get for 700 bucks.  Now, that'll get you a computer, but it's not going to get you something you can really do gaming on.  And, you know, the bigger monitor, nicer video card, a lot of memory, a lot of RAM. 
[00:27:30]  You know, so you're going to have to step up a little bit.  You know, that's fine.  You're going to have to get out the crowbar, pry open that wallet.  You know?  That's fine.  You've got to sell something good.  Like the computer that's showing up for you, Anthony.  I heard.  Yes, yes.  I got something coming that is ridiculous.  Yeah, I think you're going to be able to launch missiles with the thing they got for you.  It's like a $5,000 computer.  More than that. 
[00:28:00]  Way more than that.  When we went, when we were pricing out all the stuff for the offices, they basically asked us what we wanted.  And we said, and I asked you the couple of days before.  I said, dude, I'm going to look like a real prick if I ask for this thing because it's a lot of money.  Oh, we went for broke on this one.  Go ahead and do it.  The worst they can do is say no.  They'll say no and we'll downgrade a little bit.  Yeah, they got Anthony a top-of-the-line computer that he'll never use.  It's for gaming.  I'll use it in here.  No, you're not.  Yeah, I will.  You're going to actually stay after the show and not leave at $10.05 like we all do?  I think I'm going to buy one of those $700 computers, bring it in here, and take the other one home. 
[00:28:30]  This is what you ordered.  It's a company called Falcon Northwest that makes the ballsiest gaming, top-of-the-line audio, video editing gaming computers  and cannot get one to your specs for under $8,000, really.  Just in time for Half-Life 2.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right.  We've got to move on.  We all getting computers, Steve?  Yeah, we are.  All right, we are.  We've got to move on.  This is like boring talk to the truckers out there and everybody else.  Everyone has computers.  They sure do, Ope.  All right, Anthony, we've got lots to do today, actually. 
[00:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you want to play this Presidential Apprentice thing as we go to break?  Presidential Apprentice?  Yeah, someone put this little thing together.  Donald Trump talking to Kerry and Bush.  It's kind of funny.  Oh, and they cut up the audio?  Yeah, we also have...  But he says you're fired, and it's...  Oh, that's not it.  We also have...  It's a bullpen cannon.  We have John Kerry's speech.  We've got Bush's speech.  Great.  We'll talk about that a little bit.  We've got Tony Danza applause breaks today.  That's great.  Kerry, you have the Kerry campaigning after the election speech? 
[00:29:30]  Yes, we do.  Is that what you have?  Geez, can the guy just say, I lost, and walk off?  Tell Voss we'll get to him after the commercials.  We've got to talk to him.  Oh.  Oh, also, yeah, the How's Your News thing.  That's going to be the highlight today of the show.  Yeah, we love that show.  So, you know, stick around, but check this out.  It's the Donald talking to Kerry and Bush.  Ho-ho.  Mr. Trump is ready to see you.  George, what happened?  We thought we'd find stockpiles.  The whole world thought we'd find stockpiles.  Is that your fault?  Well, I mean, there's 30 nations now involved in Iraq. 
[00:30:00]  You think you were a good leader?  Gosh, I, you know, I, you know, I, I, you know, I don't get that.  I wanted this president to give meaning to the words.  John.  Going to war as a last resort.  John.  I don't believe he did.  You would have shut up.  I mean, you're probably not going to be chosen.  John Edwards and I both believe that.  Why do you keep talking?  And I'm committed.  I'm in the middle of saying something, and then you blurt out whatever the hell you blurt,  that nobody knows what it means anyway.  Why do you keep doing that?  I agree with all of the above, and the answer is yes. 
[00:30:30]  George.  Had we not moved, Saddam Hussein would be even more powerful.  So you think John should be fired?  You bet.  You would fire John?  Yeah, absolutely.  Fire the person.  John, you made some bad decisions.  Yes.  And you admit that you made some bad decisions.  No.  John, you fired.  He did.  Not me.  Go ahead. 
[00:31:00]  I'm sorry.  Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.  It's time to find America's sexy state.  Do you believe it's Illinois?  At that point, the thighs close down on your ears, and you feel like you're diving at about 300 feet. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, let's hear it for Karen.  Illinois, once again.  Sexy state in America.  Defending their title.  Thinking you can beat them?  Call Opie and Anthony at 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[00:32:00]  And give it your best shot.  I was in the Army.  I was in the Army.  14 months, man.  I was in the service.  Armed forces are 14 months.  I got what they call mental discharge.  I was mentally unfit.  You know.  Guys stayed in.  Guys like, anything you say, Sarge.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, the Army is really funny.  I went to the Army because in my neighborhood, right, you know, when you're 17, the cops come to your house.  You go to the Army and go to jail.  But they have this guy. 
[00:32:30]  You go to kill class and learn how to kill, right?  You know what it is.  And the lieutenant takes you, you know.  Hey, man.  Hey, please.  Keep it down.  Now, today, man, we're going to show them what Bravo company's made out of.  And we're going to do a good job for Uncle Sam.  That's right.  I'm going for a manicure.  And I'll be back at 1,600 hours or one of those funny Army times.  So.  Right, and then the sergeant comes out.  You know, kill the sergeant. 
[00:33:00]  Mr. Alfred, man.  I've had this shit up to here with these recruits.  Well, they can take these stripes and shove them.  You know what I mean?  I said, no, I'm mean.  I'm padded.  Come out of me!  Take your seat!  Today, man, we're going to learn how to kill. 
[00:33:30]  Now, I was in World War II.  I killed some, and I was killed some.  That's right, I was wounded 31 times.  To this day, I have a wooden ear. 
[00:34:00]  Funny, huh?  I don't want any of you smart-ass recruits out there striking matches on my ear.  Now, today, we're going to learn attack and defense.  I want to volunteer front and center on the double.  You learn in.  What's your name?  Sambo.  Come up here. 
[00:34:30]  Pryor, right.  Pryor, right.  Move it up here on the double.  Go!  Hey, my name ain't no Sambo.  At ease!  Private Pryor will demonstrate the leg thrust kick to the groin.  That's right, the groin.  What are you going to kill him, kicking him on the elbow?  I will demonstrate the block and elbow smash to the Adam's apple. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, excuse me, sir.  Can you get somebody else?  I have to go to the bathroom.  At ease!  Now, I want you men out there to pay close attention.  This may possibly save your lives in combat.  On the streets of New York.  Okay, Private Pryor.  Crap!  Come on, cack! 
[00:35:30]  God damn it, cack!  Crap!  Crap!  Crap!  Crap!  Crap!  Crap!  Crap!  Crap!  Crap!  I walked around, I was the hero after that, man.  You know, because the guys was coming up and getting my autograph.  You know, hey, you the guy kicked the sergeant in the nuts?  I guess.  To mother?  Sure. 
[00:36:00]  The only way you're getting a date is with a bottle of chloroform.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, my God. 
[00:36:30]  I don't know who is more disgusting, you or me.  That was a commercial, man.  That was a disgusting conversation.  Why the hell did we go to break?  That was where the funny was in the first half hour of the show.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.N.A. Virus.  Thanks for helping us spread it across America.  Wake the fuck up, Jim.  We got a radio show to do.  I thought I would share with everybody, and I got everyone grossed out, but then Anthony  took it to the next level, and I'm still laughing, man. 
[00:37:00]  You're kind of reminding me of something.  Well, after the show, I try to get a little energy, and I try to get a little exercise,  so I throw on the inline skates, and I skate in Central Park pretty much every day.  How do you not just doze off on skates?  Well, no.  After the show, I have to take my 40-minute nap.  Oh, you take a little hour nap.  It's exactly 40 minutes every day.  I don't know why.  And I wake up, and then I'm okay for the day.  And I mean just okay.  And then I throw the skates on, and I go to the park and see what's going on, and I skate  around, right? 
[00:37:30]  And then I come home.  Oh, God.  I can't believe I'm sharing this.  That's disgusting.  And I'm like, wow, I got to take a leak.  So I go in my bathroom, and I start taking a leak, and I'm like, oh, my God, what is  that smell?  Holy ass.  What the F is that?  I thought you were going to talk about maybe you had some asparagus, and your urine smelled  a little bit.  Oh, no.  But no.  No, that's a cool smell.  I don't mind that smell.  And I like asparagus.  Thanks, fella.  So then, I'm thinking, you know the mouse that's in my house? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I'm thinking, oh, my God, did the mouse finally die because it hasn't eaten any of my food  lately?  And it's rotting?  So what you were smelling was some type of decomposing flesh?  Yeah, I'm thinking, wow, I think I got to find the mouse, man.  I think it's finally...  You just farted?  No.  Give me the Lysol, please, Ben.  I have to spread the mic so I can just sit there and smell it.  I put my nose right into the microphone when Jimmy farts after I spray it.  So I'm smelling this rotting thing. 
[00:38:30]  I'm like, God, what the F?  I got to find the mouse.  I swear, that's what I was thinking.  I forgot to tell you that part.  And then I realized it's my swamp ass.  Did you have pants on?  Yeah, I had pants on.  That's what makes it worse.  What were you wearing?  Like, long pants?  It was, you know, sweats.  Now, wait a minute.  Did you have your boxer briefs on underneath?  Oh, yeah.  See, it allows you no ventilation.  Sweats, boxer briefs, really bad swamp ass. 
[00:39:00]  Those boxer briefs also, what they do, they crawl up your ass on you.  They give you wedgies.  Not like briefs do.  Regular briefs and boxers don't give you the wedgie.  Boxer briefs, they go right up your ass.  Nice.  Nice.  Like a thong.  So I'm like, thank God no one is in this apartment right now.  Because I was embarrassed, and I'm the only one there.  Of course you did.  And well, you should be.  Completely embarrassed.  I'm like, what is going on?  Smelling your ass.  So I quickly just disrobed, jumped in the shower, and take care of business.  It was the worst I've ever smelled. 
[00:39:30]  I'm like, what the freak was going on?  So I tell that story, which grossed everyone out, and Ben started dry heaving and left the studio.  Did you throw away your underwear?  No, I just scrubbed them out.  See, sometimes.  I just literally scrubbed them out in the sink.  Throw them out.  Just throw them out.  No, because this is the weird part about it.  The guy that wants me to order him a computer.  No, no, listen.  I have no problem throwing out my underwear, and I do it quite often, which gives the homeless 
[00:40:00]  people a nice treat when they're going through my garbage in the front of my apartment.  It's another story for another day.  These guys will dig in your garbage every freaking night.  But yeah, there's sometimes it looks like a used shoe shine rag, sure, and you can't be  bothered, but there was nothing really going on in them.  They just needed to be rinsed out.  If you had swamp ass to the point where you were smelling it as you're taking a leak, believe  me, there was something in it.  It was awful.  There was something in there.  I figured I would share, and then Anthony's telling this story that just beat mine, where 
[00:40:30]  he actually throws his underwear out the window.  I had to.  This was back when I worked for a living.  This was back in the ye olden days, where I was a sheet metal worker, and I'd be up  in attics that were 120 degrees.  And the night before, what was I doing?  Drinking heavily at a bar.  So you go, you take the morning dump, which isn't a treat.  You're getting a salad shooter dump there.  And then you're spending time working in an attic on your hands and knees. 
[00:41:00]  That's about, what, 120 degrees up there?  120 degrees, you're just sweating down your ass crack.  It's like a ravine.  No, it goes on.  It's just with a raging torrent of river through it.  No, because it ends up like butterscotch pudding.  No, stop it.  And know why?  Because it's like 120 degrees, so it's like candle wax melting out of your bunghole.  All right, all right, you're disgusting.  And it's slowly melting out of your bung. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, no, the sweat goes down there.  And just as it trickles through, it then disperses into your clothing and carries whatever it  went through into your clothing.  So it's got, you know, and you're getting wedgies and stuff.  Just an awful, awful way to make a living.  And I get home and go into the bathroom and go to take a shower.  You take off your clothes and you look at the underwear and it's like, oh, my God, just ravaged. 
[00:42:00]  Looked like Fallujah.  Just a mess.  A quagmire.  It was awful.  So I didn't want the wife to see that and have to wash those.  It looks like a finger painting.  Yeah.  And I couldn't throw it away.  From a preschool.  I couldn't throw it away in the bathroom garbage because that would be embarrassing for the wife  at the time to find that.  And now I would mail it with my alimony check.  Here.  Spend it well. 
[00:42:30]  But at the time.  You get.  Oh, see, it's crackling again.  Oh, you stink.  You get half of everything.  You might as well have this half.  You got to get me out of this freaking headset.  I don't get what's going on with this thing.  It just doesn't work.  And I don't think I'm on the air and I'm trying to do a line and I'm stopping because I think,  you know, we're off the air.  Just use that, Jack.  Just turn it all the way up.  At the time, I didn't want to find it.  You know, it's embarrassing.  So I didn't want to throw it in the garbage. 
[00:43:00]  So I would throw it out the bathroom window.  Right.  And I would sit there and try to open up the little tiny bathroom windows like on the  shining.  Danny!  Run, Danny!  Run!  And I would, you know, ball it up and give it the old heave-ho.  And if I got a good throw, it would go behind like the shed into the wooded area.  Yeah.  The wooden is it.  I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm just going to wash your underwear out.  I can't fit! 
[00:43:30]  Run, Danny!  We had a guy that we worked with at WAF in Boston.  It's called Skidmogs.  People who shit will notice.  Everyone's getting grossed out.  You like baby wipes, Doc?  They're getting grossed out out there.  But we had a guy we worked with, a sales guy at WAF in Boston.  He's the guy that does this laugh, by the way.  He's a very responsible salesperson now. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  But he told a story where his underwear got so bad, and he had swamp ass so bad, and  it looked like a used shoe shine rag.  I mean, the whole works, right?  And he would go to fast food restaurants, was it?  I'm trying to remember.  Yeah, I think it was at McDonald's.  Or McDonald's or something.  And he would go into the stall and, you know, take care of the area and stuff.  But he now has the underwear, and he has to go on sales calls, and he's like, there's  no way I'm putting these back on.  He would bathe in the bathroom, pretty much, with paper towels and the soap for your hands.  Yeah, he would clean up the area.  Yeah, so then he noticed there was a drop ceiling, so he would, you know, poke up the 
[00:44:30]  drop ceiling, and then put his horrendous underwear up in the ceiling.  Do you remember when Crazy Jim told us that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's horrible.  Yeah.  Because somebody's going to peek up there someday and have to take care of that.  Like, what the hell is dying in the bathroom?  Like that scene out of Aliens, where they poke up in the ceiling and all the aliens are running  at him.  That's equally as horrific.  Skid-barked underwear. 
[00:45:00]  I wouldn't know about Aliens.  I don't like chick flicks.  All right, well, enough of that, but we thought we'd share what we were doing during the commercial  break.  Got an email here.  Hey, guys, just got in from the anysoldier.usbenefit show at the Stress Factory tonight, starring  little Jimmy Norton and Rich Voss.  Norton killed as usual, but that's besides the point.  F-ing Voss.  He's so whipped, he took a call from Bonnie in the middle of his act.  It went something like this.  During his act, he checked his phone once, and as a cover, he had to make a little hacky 
[00:45:30]  cell phone joke.  So he says, fucking sprint?  They call it that because you have to run to find service.  Waka waka.  Ah, there you go.  A little while later, someone yelled out, how's Bonnie?  She's okay.  She'll be here later.  Wait, who said that?  Why am I answering you?  Who's Bonnie?  Near the end of his set, he couldn't grab the phone hanging from his pocket and get  it to his ear fast enough.  Where are you?  You're in New Brunswick?  No, I'm not bombing.  You're at the train station?  Turns to the crowd and says, how far is the train station from here? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So then the people in the front row were all trying to give him directions for Bonnie.  It was a giant clusterfuck.  As people were naming the wrong streets and turns, Bonnie would have ended up a statistic  in the paper.  So some dude from the crowd had to get up, go to the train station, and escort her to  the club.  Are you kidding me?  How effing whipped do you have to be to take a call in the middle of your set from your  chick?  Anyway, just wanted to share that with you guys.  Aside from that dignity-destroying moment, he had a great set as well. 
[00:46:30]  Maybe you could get him on the phone today and see how he defends himself.  This is from Lauren.  Did you see this last night?  No, I decided I wanted to be responsible and come home and sleep.  Ooh, so you did your set and left.  Had my car jump-started for the second time that night because the battery is dead, and  then I drove home and backed in, and the stupid PR who works at my thing doesn't understand  English.  So I'm like, look, just leave it running until you back it in.  Oh, no.  He's like, hi, hi, hi, hi.  So I had to stay in the garage while this little failure backs my car in, and then I went 
[00:47:00]  upstairs and tossed and turned and dreamed of Black Sabbath at my birthday party.  Yeah.  Like a faggot.  That's cute.  Were you wearing a little party hat?  It was awful.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Where's the band?  They left.  Maybe I can dream, next time that's my birthday and I'm kneeling in a bathroom and you put  your swamp ass in my face.  All right, well, we got Rich Voss on the phone.  Rich.  What's going on?  Hey, Rich.  What happened last night, buddy?  First of all, Norton goes on, he kills.  Right.  He just destroys, and he does it all the time.  He's such a weasel. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Whenever, oh, I got to go on in the middle because I got to get back home, you know?  Never.  Like the extra half an hour is going to kill him, you know?  I always close those shows.  He takes a prime, deep prime.  I mean, he's funny.  He's got a lot of funny stuff.  Don't talk about me like I'm not here, stupid.  I'm right here.  All right.  And the only thing worse than your cell count is your battery.  So, okay, 0 for 1.  Well, but I don't always go on in the middle.  I just, I actually, I had a legitimate reason last night.  Last time we did, we did a fundraiser at the Stress Factory a couple months ago for Levy.  Bob Levy. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, you know what?  And I went on.  Shut up and listen.  One of our B comic friends, his wife is leaving him because he brings girls on stage and eats  whipped cream out of their answers.  Wait, who does that?  Bob Levy.  Oh, my God.  He brings girls on stage and eats whipped cream.  Blue cheese.  Oh, blue cheese.  And his wife is divorcing him, and he can't imagine why.  That's going to be fun in court when that comes up.  I know.  No pictures, right?  So, we do a fundraiser, and Levy goes on, and he kills, but he's filthy.  And Norm's like, I don't want to go on after him. 
[00:48:30]  Can you follow him?  Yeah.  And then I'll go, okay.  You know, he's too dirty.  I didn't say he was too dirty.  No, I didn't.  What would you say?  I never could follow Levy historically in my career.  He's the one guy I was always, never wanted to go on after.  Well, you know what?  To get over your fears, you have to do things like that.  Well, sorry, I can't host every show like you do.  I'll host.  What are you, fucking Bob Eubanks?  Every show you do, you want to host.  You're right.  I want to host because I know how to carry a show, stupid.  So, last night, he goes on, and he destroys. 
[00:49:00]  It's just really funny fluid comedy.  A lot of stuff about his fluids and different diseases.  Sure.  It destroys, right?  So, I go right after him.  Jerk.  Right?  And, you know, I do an hour.  No problem.  You know, you can follow him.  You can follow that kind of humor.  You just do stuff with punchlines and stuff, right?  Yeah.  So, where are you from?  Yeah.  I didn't work at home.  Stuff with punchlines.  What are you drinking?  So, during the show...  Well, Rich, I'm not to interrupt you, but I'm sorry I had to get out of there. 
[00:49:30]  But I was running late.  My cell phone wasn't working, so I had to sprint for service.  Or did you have to check your RSVP list to see if Black Sabbath is coming to the party?  That's a true story.  I had a little dream.  Yeah, you had a little dream.  Black Sabbath must have been really upset that they were all wet on in the face.  I can see upset little Jimmy in his dream that Black Sabbath wasn't at his party.  They were at the party.  MTV threw me a party.  Yeah.  And there was a special treat, and then Sabbath left.  Did you tell me how to leave the party early because you had to get up for work? 
[00:50:00]  Sorry, but...  Anyhow, so...  I don't like the fact that you almost named somebody in Sabbath and realized you couldn't.  I know.  I know.  I forgot the guy's name.  Sorry, guitar player.  I can't believe you grabbed that one.  Wow.  So, I'm on stage, you know, and I get a phone call.  Now, my girlfriend is coming from New York on a train, which she's never done.  Okay, she's from Canada. 
[00:50:30]  And she was coming from New York from her Letterman audition when she got the show.  And, you know, I never took the train from New York to New Brunswick either.  So, you know, I get a call on stage, and I kind of thought it might be her.  You know, New Brunswick is in a place you want some little white girl walking around.  And she got off, you know, off the train, and I said, where are you?  You know, I was wondering, look, I was already at 50-something. 
[00:51:00]  This was during your act, though.  I don't really have an act.  Thank God he's finally admitting it.  Okay.  And, you know, this was right before, you know, I was going to say, you know, you can get my new DVD to the audience.  You got a new DVD at richfoss.com?  Yeah, it's just, yeah, and I guess the first people I thank on the DVD is my good friends, Opie and Anthony,  who, you know, I don't call in the morning just to thrash them and trash them because their girl calls them. 
[00:51:30]  So she called, and I said, you know, I tried to get her directions, and people got up from, you know,  the audience and started walking out to go find her, not to help me because she's hot, you know,  and they thought maybe they'd have a shot in three blocks.  So, you know, one guy goes out, and then she tells me some guy comes up and goes, I'm a cop.  You know, he shows his badge, and, you know, and they walk her over to the, and the sprint joke is not a hacky joke.  That's a funny joke.  I didn't say it was hacky.  I don't know, whoever called in or wrote in, you know. 
[00:52:00]  But now we're getting a lot of people that are saying you're kind of pussy whipped now with Bonnie.  Well.  Do you blame him?  Jesus.  Well, but what do you mean, you know, finally a guy, you know, a guy is happy with, you know, this time with a girl,  and, you know, it's not like I, you know, yeah, I don't know if that's what you would call it.  I'm just, you know, I'm a good boyfriend.  You're not a good boyfriend or a good friend.  You're not a good anything.  You're a creep. 
[00:52:30]  Although, I'm kind of caught in the middle.  As one of Voss's best friends, I'm kind of caught in the middle between being, because she is really hot, and they get along great.  And look, they're a good couple.  But I'm caught in between being happy for him and wanting to smash his face.  Yeah.  When we're going to Albany, the phone keeps ringing because they're in love.  It keeps ringing, and he keeps answering it.  I'm like, could you be a fucking guy for once?  He would just answer the call every time.  I'm in the middle of telling a great Hummer story and how the guy reacted when I gave it.  As we're driving to Albany, he goes, can you be a guy and pull into this rest area? 
[00:53:00]  Here's the thing.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Hi, poofy.  Yes, Snookums.  No, just driving with Jimmy.  Okay.  No.  I love you, too.  Oh, hold on, Jim.  Hold on.  We're at mile marker five.  Hi, Snookums.  But, Rich, the problem is...  Wubby, wubby, wubby, you, too. 
[00:53:30]  I just realized that my relative is really, really sick.  Hold that thought, Jim.  Hold that thought.  Good improv skills.  I say my relative.  Could I have picked one?  My relative.  Well, I'm really concerned.  One of my ancestors.  He stinks.  My kin is ill. 
[00:54:00]  Yes, Snookums.  Wow.  Richie, wubby, you, too.  Richie, biggie, wubby, you, too.  Oh, hey, Jim, remember the time I was getting a blowjob and you were dogging that chick in the...  Oh, hold on, hold on.  No, lover.  You're the only one in my life.  My forever girl.  You're my forever girl. 
[00:54:30]  You complete me.  Oh, Jim, you're getting pulled over.  This is a good opportunity for me to take this call.  Oh, I understand why you do it, Jim.  Why you do it, Voss.  She's a very attractive, very nice girl, and I don't even understand for a second why she's with you. 
[00:55:00]  I just don't get it.  That's why he answers the phone.  He's afraid if he doesn't answer, something's going to happen where she realizes what an ass she's dating.  Like the phone's ringing for her, and she's like, why am I even with this guy?  Like he's got to distract her right away.  Oh, let me get that immediately.  He doesn't even let the ring finish.  Oh, hold on, yes?  Hello?  Oh, honey? 
[00:55:30]  Is that you, darling?  Yes, baby.  Oh, baby?  Oh, honey?  Oh, man.  Is that you?  Don't hang up.  I'm here.  You know what the sad thing is? 
[00:56:00]  When it rings, her picture comes up.  I put that into my phone.  You're kidding.  I swear to God, her picture comes up.  It's the same ring right now that you're doing.  I'm getting really scared that she's really calling right now.  Hold on, guys.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, Voss, you rock.  You met her at the roast, right? 
[00:56:30]  We met her at the roast, and she's a lovely girl.  And she's funny, too.  And, you know, what are the odds?  I mean, listen, Norton's my best friend.  When me and her have sex, I definitely think of Norton's tits.  Voss, let me tell you something about Bonnie.  We felt guilty.  We talked about the roast the next day.  Ann and I were just looking at her boobs the whole time.  They're perfect.  And we felt kind of creepy, you know, because it's your chick and stuff.  It's your chick.  But they were, like, falling out of that dress, and she's sexy to be very low-cut. 
[00:57:00]  You don't think I dropped a couple of loads on my chest thinking of your girlfriend?  And then I'm thinking, you know, God, she definitely saw me looking at her boobs.  I couldn't help it.  Really?  Oh, my God, dude.  She was just so hot at that thing.  Jeez, Opie, relax.  She was so ridiculously hot.  Opie just had his head in his hands going, oh, my God.  I was just like, wow.  Well, maybe you can get some his and her rollerblades and take her to Central Park.  Yeah, baby!  Don't listen to what Opie has to say. 
[00:57:30]  But I did feel like we felt like creeps, and I discussed it.  We were walking back to, you know, like 57th Street talking about your chick's boobs, man.  Well, you had to look at something.  You couldn't see the stage from those awful seats we got.  Oh, God.  The seats that Voss got us for that roast?  Yeah, thanks, Voss.  I'm surprised you didn't take pictures of them, Norton.  I did.  They weren't a celebrity seat.  I did.  I got pictures of how far away we were, actually.  Yeah, I got that.  I got that picture, too.  We should put it up on opiananthony.com.  All right. 
[00:58:00]  I got one.  It was the Donald Trump roast that we went to.  And our seats were...  We were special guests of Rich Voss.  Yeah, and as we were going, we just had to keep walking upstairs.  Like, no one else had to go upstairs.  They were all on the floor.  There were literally, like, ten tables upstairs in the balcony.  No, but here's the deal.  You didn't have to be stuck amongst all those stuffy people down there.  Oh, right.  And who were actually seeing the roast.  Yeah, who were we with the party people upstairs who were looking at the monitors?  God forbid we're actually in the building. 
[00:58:30]  If you would have had quarters, you could have looked through one of those big viewfinders  and saw the stage from where you were.  It could have been a Bill Cosby roast from where we were.  I had no clue.  Donald Trump?  What?  Who was that?  I wanted to hug Robert Klein.  Thank God I had enough quarters to put in the viewfinders so I could see the stage.  That's what I just said.  I know.  Thank you.  Well, okay, so I have every now and then a bad one.  Here's the deal.  You know, you're telling nothing against the wall.  Here's the deal.  First of all...  Those...  Hold on right there.  I got a call. 
[00:59:00]  I got a call.  What do you call it?  Do you know what those seats cost at that roast?  Do you know what?  You know what?  Who's the first people I said to get into the roast?  My pal Norton, my pal Zobin Anthony, and I'll throw my family in.  I cut my sister loose to get you guys in.  Really?  Thank you.  She bothers me anyhow.  It was a lot of fun.  All right, Foss.  It was all right.  All right.  I got to get back up to bed.  She's calling me.  All right.  Why don't you go back to bed?  This was a very successful call. 
[00:59:30]  Hey, do you guys want to have sex live on the show today?  What's that?  Do you want to have sex live on the show today?  Oh, it takes me an hour for the pill to kick in.  Leave with that one.  Leave with that one.  Just walk away.  Just walk away, sir.  We'll do that one day.  Really?  I will.  Of course I will.  He will.  I will.  Dude, you talk to her right now and make this happen because it will be the funniest thing  I ever hear. 
[01:00:00]  Are you serious?  Yeah, it's satellite radio.  We got a couple from California.  They're going to have sex next in a few minutes here.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  It could be really funny.  Would she be up for it?  I doubt it.  I mean, I would be, and I could fake it.  Of course you would be.  Can I just jack off on your show?  She's not into it.  You could just watch her and whack off live on the show.  That could be funny, too.  Oh, God.  Standing by the foot of the bed, just jacking it. 
[01:00:30]  Whispering so as not to wake her.  Roll off.  Roll over.  Jesus.  Shred and Reagan are calling soon.  They're good guys.  Hey, are you playing a bowling alley in Suffolk County next week?  Is that where I'm at?  Oh.  Hold on.  My phone's ringing.  I don't know where I'm at.  I don't know.  If they pay me my money, I'm there.  Can someone pick up my girl?  All right, Voss.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  I'll talk to you guys.  If you want to call back and have sex, do that, all right?  Put the producer on the phone.  The producer?  His name's Ben, you ass.  Oh, no.  You Hollywood ass.  Who else called me?  Huh?  Somebody else called me.  Was that Ben?  It was Eric.  Oh, it was probably Eric.  It was Eric.  Yeah.  Know the players, bro.  You've been a friend for years.  I know.  I don't know the new guy.  Put the producer on the phone.  You don't know the new guy.  I don't know the new guy.  Eric's cool.  It's Eric, Ben, and Steve.  Can I speak to Rick?  All right, Voss.  All right.  See you, Rich.  Very good. 
[01:01:30]  It is, Rich.  Very good phone call from Rich Voss.  That was funny.  That was fun.  We have Adam and Ariel.  Speaking.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Rich should have a little pin setter in his mouth to adjust his teeth at the bowling alley.  Wouldn't that be fun?  All of a sudden, the pin setter comes down, wipes out some of his teeth, picks up a 7-10  eye-tooth split.  It's got to be interesting to look at the bowling alley.  Hello.  Hello.  Can you hear us?  Yes, we can.  Hello.  All right.  So who do we have?  We have Adam and Ariel?  Correct. 
[01:02:00]  And what do you guys want to do on the show today?  We're going to do a live sex show for you guys.  Oh, there we go.  A couple taking pics and sending them?  To us.  Yes, we'll be taking pictures, and once we're finished, I'll be sending them away.  Where are you guys from?  We're from Sacramento, California.  Wow.  Funny you should say Sacramento.  Oh, no.  Really?  Why?  I'll be there tomorrow and Saturday at the punchline.  Oh, right there in Sacramento.  Right there?  Right down the street.  All right.  Well, come to the show.  I most likely will.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  So you guys want to try to beat out Illinois as the sexiest state in America? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, they just did a blowjob.  That's lame.  Well, what do you guys have in store for today's show?  Lame.  I wouldn't call it lame.  Well, I mean, it's not lame.  Even a bad one is good, bro.  Come on.  But, no, we're going to do oral and full-on sex for you guys.  All right.  Is she hot?  Yeah, she's really hot.  Of course she is.  Of course you would say that.  What does she look like?  She is 5'6", probably weighs about maybe 108 on a good day, maybe like 106 on a normal day. 
[01:03:00]  5'6 and 108?  Yeah.  She's a rail.  Seriously, picture the Little Mermaid, and no joke, that's what she looks like, like reddish brown hair and stuff like that.  Same name even, right?  Have you guys started sending pictures?  Yeah, they sent some last week.  She's not lying.  She's very cute.  And you'll have these pictures up later today on opnasa.com?  Yes, they will be.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Can we talk to her for a second?  Yeah, not a problem.  Here she is.  Okay.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hello. 
[01:03:30]  Hi.  Arielle, what's up?  Hi.  You're into this today, huh?  Huh?  You're into this today?  Yes, I am.  Nice.  How long have you guys been hooked up?  Seven months.  Seven months?  Yes.  All right.  You're getting naked right now?  Actually, we're already naked.  Ah, I love it.  There you go.  And it's four in the morning out there in California, huh?  Yes, it is.  Did you guys go out last night?  No, we didn't.  We stayed in. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, so you set your alarm clock just to do this today?  No.  Well, we stayed...  I stayed up till one, and then I finally passed out, and Adam stayed up with his friend,  and I just woke up again, so...  All right.  And how is Adam going to do you today?  How's he going to do me?  Let's see.  Well, Doggy's kind of my favorite, so that's what I'm hoping for.  Oh.  There to dream.  Wait, what's her favorite?  Doggy.  Doggy.  Oh, Doggy.  Yeah, right on.  All right, so are we starting, or what? 
[01:04:30]  Yes, we are starting.  He's already down there doing his thing?  He's starting to get down there.  He's working on it.  Wow.  Oh, all right, then.  Are you also going to perform oral treats on him, ma'am?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  No, we want just her to get banged today.  I want to hear a hummer, too, though.  You've got to hear her mouth full as she's moaning with pleasure.  That's a good one.  Arielle, you've got to kind of tell us what's going on, because this is the radio.  And who's taking the pictures, by the way? 
[01:05:00]  We actually just take the pictures together.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  They take the pictures of me, and...  You got a nice figure?  Yes, I do.  A nice figure, foxy lady?  Right.  Okay.  Well...  I hear something going on there, right?  Right now, he's tickling me with his tongue.  Nice.  Down in my skin area. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  He's, uh...  He has found the button?  Huh?  He has found the button?  He has found the button.  Wow.  Tickle, tickle.  He's...  Oh.  You hear that?  He's...  That's great.  Oh.  He's sucking on my clit right now. 
[01:06:00]  Oh.  And no one's going to dump out of this, right?  I'm trying to figure out the satellite radio thing.  You just keep going.  All right.  Sorry.  Don't listen to us. 
[01:06:30]  Okay.  Just let us know what's going on every once in a while, okay?  Okay.  Okay.  You pass.  What was that noise? 
[01:07:00]  Nothing.  Don't pay attention to what you're...  Okay.  Oh, Bonnie.  Hearing.  All right.  We're going to change positions.  All right.  All right.  What are you going to change to?  I'm going to give him a little bit of head right now.  So I'm going to let you guys go to him.  Hold on.  No, we'd rather hear you doing it.  Yeah.  We'd rather hear you doing it.  We'd rather hear you doing it. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you go down there with the phone and tell us what's going on?  What's going on?  Okay.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, guys.  Oh, Billy.  This feels so good, guys.  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on, Ariel?  All right.  Well, here I go.  I'm going to go down.  All right.  She's going down.  So we're not going to have to take a meeting from Ken Stevens after doing this, right? 
[01:08:00]  No.  No.  Okay.  We're not at WNEW anymore, right?  No.  Okay.  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You sound like she's got a Jolly Rancher, doesn't it? 
[01:08:30]  It's turning into a big Jolly Rancher.  Well, you're going to get that soon.  You know that, right?  Mm-hmm.  The harder I work for it, the better it's going to be.  Of course.  Wow.  Good girl.  I'll say.  I like her voice.  She's got a very sexy voice.  Mm-hmm.  And they're taking pictures, and it's going to be up on opianthony.com. 
[01:09:00]  Hmm.  Is he almost ready, Ariel?  Oh, yeah.  I'm ready for this.  You ready for that?  I'm ready.  Yeah?  Okay.  I'm going to climb on top.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  All right.  You're climbing on top, right?  Yes.  Okay. 
[01:09:30]  Tell us what's going on.  Okay.  I'm fighting him in right now.  Jesus, Jim.  Come on, Jim.  Let's enjoy this.  Get your hands out of your lap.  What?  I'm...  Okay.  Okay.  I'm ready.  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  It's getting hot. 
[01:10:00]  I love that. 
[01:10:30]  I'm going to have him change positions with me. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  A little change of positions going on.  Is this for the grand finale?  We're going to go for the grand finale.  I'm going to have him get behind me right now.  Ah, a little doggy style.  And I'm going to hold on to the bed of the bars.  Okay.  All right.  California attempting to be the sexiest state in America.  Let's see if they got what it takes, Anthony.  Okay.  Here we go.  I'm going to hold on to the bed. 
[01:11:30]  This guy's a champ, man. 
[01:12:00]  Lucky girl.  Oh, wow. 
[01:12:30]  Sweetie?  What?  That's not you, is it?  Meet me at the bowling alley.  Oh, God.  I need a towel. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  I need a towel.  Come on.  They're applauding for the other booth, too.  Thumbs up.  Wow.  Adam and Arielle from California.  Sexiest state in America.  Wait, I'll be.  Stop, Jim.  Jesus Christ, Jim.  I know.  Stop.  Hey.  Holy.  Good God.  How big does that thing get?  Jesus.  That was great.  Well, I'm going to give it to Adam so I can go clean up. 
[01:13:30]  Fantastic.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Thanks for having me.  That was very, very good.  And you guys took pictures of this?  Yes, we did.  Well, let's get, you know something?  What do you think?  Well, it's kind of up to the listeners.  It's kind of up to the listeners, but the consensus in here, at least I would say, we have  a new winner here.  A new sexiest state in America.  We have a brand new sexiest state in America.  Well, let's just make sure, let's let the listeners vote on instant feedback. 
[01:14:00]  Yes.  You had to have heard the Illinois couple when they did it, not the promo.  Yeah.  And tell us what you think, okay?  But I think these guys, yeah, just got the title.  Fast Freddy saying, attempting California became the sexiest state as soon as she said  he's sucking on my clit right now.  She has a very sexy voice.  Yeah, Arielle, that rocked.  That was very hot.  And that guy's a champ, man.  Cali has my vote. 
[01:14:30]  Fucking awesome.  We have a winner.  All right.  California is a blue state.  B-L-E-W.  Chuck, the trucker says, that rocked.  Illinois should concede.  Illinois will be giving their concession speech.  Well, we have to look at all the numbers first, Opia.  I'm not willing to announce that California has indeed won yet.  I'm going to give it to the blue state, California.  Wow.  That was fantastic.  New winner. 
[01:15:00]  California, absolutely sexy estate.  You should judge who's the sexiest by how large Norton's cock gets.  Well, if we're going on that, obviously California is the winner.  I don't think anyone's going to beat California then, because I can't imagine it gets any bigger  than that, Jimmy.  He stands up, and he had a meerkat in his pants, just squirming around trying to get out.  That was hot.  That was hot.  It sounded real.  It wasn't like that corny porn moan.  It was like a real moan.  Very good.  That was a real girl moan right there. 
[01:15:30]  A real girl really enjoying it.  Boston checking in saying, that was wicked.  Wicked.  They love that wicked word up in Boston, but they're giving you the wicked today.  Johnny from PA, I feel so dirty, I just spanked to the radio.  Andy from London, London, England, checking in.  Holy crap, it's noon here in England, and I'm having to make excuses why I can't get up  from my desk to go to lunch right now.  All right.  How is he checking?  How is he listening?  On the computer?  I guess, yeah.  This is a stupid question.  How else would he be listening?  People are bootlegging the show all over the world. 
[01:16:00]  I'm starting to learn.  They're like downloading illegal feeds.  Feeds?  Feeds, yeah.  All right.  Did I say fees?  Feeds.  Feeds.  Okay.  And Dustin from Columbus, this shit is too hot for drivers.  So we're going to give you the title.  Sacramento, California.  Adam and Ariel, sexiest state in America.  California.  As of today.  You want to talk to Adam?  This is the sexiest state.  Want to talk to Adam real fast, Adam?  No, not really.  I'd like to say hi to Adam.  Yeah, here he is. 
[01:16:30]  Hold on.  All right.  Thank you, Ariel.  You're welcome.  We look forward to hearing you guys again in the future.  Hello?  Adam.  Adam, fantastic.  Bravo.  That was a great job, Adam.  You gave her a great tooling for us there, Adam.  Oh, of course.  Always.  You got a lot of stamina, my friend.  Not that much, but it's okay.  That was good.  What was she doing?  She was on her knees and she was grabbing the bedpost or something?  Yes, she was.  We have one of those little brass, cheap frames and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Grabbing onto that.  So she's on her knees. 
[01:17:00]  You're getting her from behind and her hands are, instead of being on the bed like doggy  style, she's kind of gripping the brass rail.  Yeah, basically for support.  That's pretty hot right there.  Yeah.  That's a good image.  It definitely turns me on a little bit.  Yeah, it should.  All right.  Well, you guys got it.  Did we?  That's awesome.  That kicks off.  And you're going to be sending pictures to Steve?  Yes, I am.  All right, cool.  So we'll check that out later today on opianthony.com.  Hopefully they'll look like, you know, the cast of the OC, Opie, instead of, you know, obese.  Hopefully looking hot. 
[01:17:30]  Nothing, right?  No.  I don't know what the OC is.  Of course you don't.  Why watch TV?  Hey, if you guys can come this weekend, man.  I see you at the club this weekend.  I'd, you know, come in.  Yeah, definitely would.  I'm not even plugging myself.  I'd say I'd compliment.  Just begging.  Because Jimmy wants to watch you guys do that again when he's out there.  No, no, no.  I would just copy it if you want to come to one of the shows.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Sometime when we have enough money, we'll fly out to New York and we'll come on to the show.  And do it live?  Yes.  Nice.  Could be interesting.  We would do a live show for you guys.  Live show.  How much money do you need? 
[01:18:00]  Jesus.  How much money do you need to get to New York?  All right.  Let's figure out the...  Let's do some calculations here.  Okay.  Yeah, let's see what it is.  Yeah.  You figure out how much it's going to cost.  Don't make that happen.  Are you kidding me?  That would be awesome.  That would definitely be like a dream come true.  For us, too.  A dream come true to F in front of us?  You sick fuck.  I'm a sick bastard, but it's okay.  Don from Connecticut saying, I need a towel.  Put it over the top.  Yeah.  When she stopped and I need a towel, that's really good. 
[01:18:30]  I think the squeaking bed put it over the top.  That was pretty good, too.  No, I used to listen to you guys when I lived back in Boston.  At WAAF.  Yes, 107.3.  Cool.  All right.  Well, thanks, Adam.  Hold on the line, okay?  Not a problem.  Bye, mister.  All right.  The votes are in.  Definitely California.  Sexiest state in America.  Beat that, America.  Beat that.  Beat that.  Beat that.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony or feed this little kid with the flies 
[01:19:00]  on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, you need a driver there, buddy.  Who's this?  This is Jake calling about the job, driving.  I saw it in the paper.  Yes.  Yeah, well, you still need to drive or what?  Did you feel an application with us, Jake?  Pardon me?  Huh?  Speak up there.  What did you say? 
[01:19:30]  You feel an application with us?  No, no, no, no.  Look, I saw it here in the paper and I'm calling you, fruitcake.  I'm looking for a job driving a truck.  We're looking for movers.  Yeah, well, that's what I do.  What class driver's license do you have?  I got five, one, two, three, four.  I got them all.  Yeah, class one?  Yeah, I drive buses, trucks.  I'll back a truck through the fucking two-family house garage.  One of those big two-ton trucks.  When was the last time you drove a truck through trailer?  Oh, jeez, what the fuck? 
[01:20:00]  I'd say about two weeks ago, I robbed one down in Jersey and I drove it up here to New York.  Fucking flying.  Drove it through the tolls, no stopping, no nothing.  I'm good.  I said, why don't you call back on Monday?  Hey, I'll tell you what.  I come in, I'll take you for a test spin.  How's that?  We go out and we take the truck around the fucking block.  I speed, I pop wheelies.  I'm good, baby.  Go back on Monday.  All right, can I get you?  I want you.  You sound good.  You and me.  We make a team.  You drive with me. 
[01:20:30]  All right?  What's your name again?  Jake.  Hey, who did you work for, Jake?  Oh, jeez, I worked for Moish.  I worked for Mayflower.  You know?  Oh, yeah.  Don't sh-  Hey, I was good with them, too.  You worked for Moish?  Yeah, that's right.  When?  About, what, two years ago?  See, when I got a problem there, they get fucking scared when I pop the wheelies and  all that shit.  You know, I pop a lot of wheelies.  I'm good with that shit.  You know, I don't break no merchandise.  See, I get it there two hours ahead of time, all the time.  What do you say?  I say, if you pop any wheelies there, I'm not even going to put in your position. 
[01:21:00]  Listen to me.  I don't break nothing, sizzle chest.  I'm good.  Okay.  Call Monday.  We'll set up an interview.  Okay?  All right.  I'll do that there, Rubberneck.  I'll call you Monday.  Okay.  All right, fruitcake.  See you later.  Never wait for traffic and weather reports again.

[01:23:30]  Bob from Jersey.  Hey, Bab.  Did you guys see the cans on the president's daughter is on the cover of the post this morning?  The one in the black dress, you can see that half dollar she's hiding in her dress.  Yeah, we commented on this before.  Before the show even started, we were talking to each other about this one.  The New York Post, the headline says Pop Star.  And her nipples are popping out.  It's the president's daughter.  The one that looks more like Laura Bush.  There's one that looks like Laura.  And then there's one that looks like George W. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, they've got one of each.  The one that looks like Laura is kind of cuter.  Which one's going to look like the grandma when she gets older?  Like, I can't figure it out.  I just think it would be disturbing bedding down with the one that looks like George W.  Because you'd look at that face and just, it's George W.'s face.  Look, her face is George W.'s face.  Yeah, same face.  She's got the long blonde hair and the, you know, the cans.  She's a little, she's not a skinny girl.  She's not, by any stretch of the imagination, fat. 
[01:24:30]  But she's got something to her.  She's probably the one that's going to look like the grandma, eventually.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  The Barbara Bush?  Mm-hmm.  You keep forgetting that's their grandma.  That mess.  Barbara Bush.  His other daughter's hotter, though, I think, the one with the nips.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something about her that's kind of, she looks more like Laura.  Yeah, but she has problems with the eyes.  She looks cross-eyed.  Well, the mother is, too.  Laura Bush has some Go Funny eyeballs on her.  Well, and that daughter has the same thing going on with the eyes.  That's all right.  Oh, my God, they might be monitoring us right now. 
[01:25:00]  Why are we talking about his daughters?  Oh, they're going to be after me.  We better not talk about the daughters of the president.  They'll send the black helicopters to chase me down as I drive out to the Hamptons.  And hide.  That's it.  It's all over.  Because I pushed Kerry, they're all going to be after me now.  The government's coming after me.  It's their first agenda, I'm sure, in their meetings that they have as a re-elected president,  Robin.  They're all going to be after me now.  Man, he's going to actually have to do a radio show now.  He's actually going to have to do a radio show for everybody. 
[01:25:30]  Not just political breaks for the whole day?  For a whole year.  Now he's got to actually talk about something that maybe his listeners will find interesting.  Talk about how the president's after him.  The reality is, with this radio crap, Anthony and I and guys like ourselves that do this  type of radio, when we were doing it on commercial radio, we got away with murder.  And no one has ever acknowledged this, and we should acknowledge this.  We got away with murder.  Literally, we did kill somebody, and we buried him. 
[01:26:00]  And guys like Howard bitching and complaining about the FCC and things like that.  The fact is, the type of radio we were doing on commercial radio, we should have been fined  literally, I don't know, a dozen times.  We got away with murder.  You know, and then every once in a while, you get slapped by the FCC, and you should  take your beating and move on.  Ouch.  You know?  I can name, God, I can name a dozen bits we did that the FCC should have had a problem  with.  Yo, the president's not after you, okay?  Whew.  It's after me. 
[01:26:30]  Rapping.  That's the reality of this, like, shock jock stuff.  We get away with murder out there, and did on commercial radio.  I was listening to Bush's acceptance speech, Robin, and there were secret messages in there.  Did you hear?  Secret messages that he's after me.  I'm able to decipher them, because I know the code, because if you take his speech and  add up all the letters, and then multiply all what the numbers would have been by eight,  it says, I'm coming to get Howard Stern. 
[01:27:00]  Can you shut up and just do a radio show?  Take a lesson from Lenny Bruce, you ass.  What do you think killed Lenny Bruce's career in the end?  They're after me.  Getting away from what Lenny Bruce was great at.  Like, the president, who just got re-elected, has an inkling of a thought about you.  It's ridiculous to even think that.  Never mind trying to convince people that it's the truth.  You know what, though?  The reality is starting to sink in. 
[01:27:30]  We got Bush for four more years.  Were you thinking that, too?  Yeah.  Also, it was like...  All the hoopla's over with, and you're like, oh, jeez, four more years.  Yeah.  And there's nothing out there to control him.  Yeah, because he has no accountability now.  He was kind of...  You know, you'd think he was crazy and all, but he had some accountability.  He had to see if he could win another election.  Well, now he can't run again, so he's going to do whatever the hell he damn well pleases  now. 
[01:28:00]  Could get very interesting in the next few years.  You know what I'm interested in?  He wants to reform the tax law.  Now, if he could squeak that out, he'd get a little redemption, because the tax laws are  ridiculous.  You have to get together with the millions of forms that no one could figure out, and  accountants, and this, that.  If he could simplify that and make it easier, that would be a great achievement by him, I  think.  But that'll fall to the wayside.  I think he's so preoccupied with the war, and I really think you're going to see some  ass-kicking now in Iraq. 
[01:28:30]  I think nothing was being done for quite a while, because if something went wrong, they  would be able to criticize it and drag it into the election.  Now that he's elected, I think you're really, as a matter of fact, I think there are airstrikes  on Fallujah right now, and they're gearing up for a major offensive, they're saying.  Good.  So that would be good if he could get in there and start kicking some ass.  I'm not against the war, and I don't think, I think a lot of people have a misconception  that people that were for Kerry or against Bush were against the war.  I want more ass-kicking to go on in Iraq. 
[01:29:00]  There's no way you could just pull out now and leave.  It would be a disaster.  So go in there with balls, with a lot of guys, a lot of equipment, and really wreak  some havoc.  Don't sit there.  You've got to read about our guys getting killed, and then you also read in the same  sentence that they've got this place surrounded, a mosque, and they're negotiating with this  and that, and they didn't want to make any decisive moves because it would screw up this  re-election campaign.  Well, you're done.  You're the president.  You're re-elected. 
[01:29:30]  Now kick some ass and get out of there.  You know how miserable those insurgents must have been when they hear that he's re-elected?  Oh, I know.  That's just going to be like, ugh.  Oh.  It's like, ugh, this is going to get ugly.  A couple were so angry, they cut their own heads off.  They were so pissed off.  Ah!  Hey, we got John Kerry talking from yesterday.  We'll play just a little bit of this, and then we got to-  This is his console-  What's the word I'm looking for?  Concession?  Concession.  That's like consolation speech.  Consolieri speech.  Look at me with the big word today.  You're out, John.  Concession.  Concession speech. 
[01:30:00]  Maybe I could shoot Botox and be a bore.  You're out, John.  You're out, John.  He's out.  Well, he's kind of delusional in his speech.  He's a little delusional.  He's still campaigning.  Yeah.  You listen to the speech, it's not really a speech of, hey, he's the president, we gave  it a good shot, take it easy.  And I hope George Bush-  You know something?  You can hope all you want.  You're done.  Bush was probably watching it going, yeah, hope all you want there.  And that awful bore vote, they said Gephardt would have been a better vice presidential  choice, and I think so, too. 
[01:30:30]  That John Edwards, oh, that fat-headed boyish charm.  I think they were going for the chick vote with that one.  Of course they were.  Of course they were.  Trying to get, oh, he's so handsome.  All right.  And if you're bored with this, don't worry, this is going to lead into retards talking about  politics.  Hey.  Doing the news.  It's kind of what it is now.  Isn't that what this show is when we take this tack?  Wait till you hear what we got, though.  Wait till you hear.  But first, here's John Kerry yesterday.  Thank you so much.  You just have no idea how warming and how generous that welcome is, your love is, your affection, 
[01:31:00]  and I'm gratified by it.  I'm sorry that we got here a little bit late and a little bit short.  Earlier today, I spoke to President Bush, and I offered him and Laura our congratulations  on their victory.  Click.  We had a good conversation.  Hang up on him.  And we talked about the danger of division in our country and the need, the desperate need 
[01:31:30]  for unity, for finding the common ground, coming together.  Oh, my God.  Today, shut up.  All right, listen.  Shut up.  At this point, Bush doesn't care what you have to say.  Do you think Bush was on the other end with everybody in the room with him, doing that  thing you do, where you pull the phone away, look at who you're with, and move your hand  like a mouth and go, God won't shut the fuck up.  Right.  You know, and Mr. President, congratulations.  I think the country can now reunite. 
[01:32:00]  Snorting lines off my hooker tits.  Right.  Shaney's ass.  Snorting lines off at Shaney's ass.  Do you honestly think that Bush is listening to him right now?  Oh, oh, John, that's my, that's my, uh, I'm getting another call in.  Oh, no, can I call you back?  No one would make this better as, like, some drug music.  If you guys could find some drug music.  Drug music quickly for Opie.  Drug music.  Wow, that's a tough order because that's, you know, you're being a little vague. 
[01:32:30]  Well, you can find some cream.  So now we'll see if it's an actual drug song.  As the bagel goes down my windpipe as I'm, why eat on the air, asshead?  You want me to come over there and give you a little Heimlich?  Yeah, it is.  Bush isn't listening to what he has to say.  No.  I hope that we can begin the healing.  Yeah.  In America.  Oh, Tony Dan's applause break right there.  What healing?  No one's wounded.  Good healing.  There's no, you're right.  How about healing your Democrat assholes because Bush just raped you? 
[01:33:00]  That's what you need to heal, stupid.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's all well and good, John.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, healing.  Healing.  That's what we got to do.  We got to heal.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, very good.  No, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Reunited.  Reunited.  That's great. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, hold on a second.  Woo!  Cocaine.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What?  Hold on.  My other phone's ringing.  All right, fade the cocaine down a little bit.  Like, he cares.  I want you to find another drug song now.  I'm going to challenge the booth, all right?  He had his people.  He had his people, John Kerry.  His people got him so pumped up that he actually thought he was going to win this thing. 
[01:34:00]  That's why I like seeing the disappointed Democrats, because they actually thought they  were going to win this thing.  And there's no healing to be done.  I mean, honestly, I think I lean Democrat for the most part, but it's like, all right,  well, we got Bush.  All right, whatever.  I got a job to do, and I got to continue with my life.  That's it.  And that's how most people think.  I didn't want Kerry, but I sure didn't want Bush in there either.  But there was no other choice.  Healing?  What healing?  So you just deal with it. 
[01:34:30]  Healing.  Like, there's such a divide.  It's no different than your baseball team losing.  Right.  There you go.  The Red Sox beat the Yankees.  Wow.  It sucked for a day or two.  Let's get this healing.  Are we still thinking about it?  Well, they did need some healing after that one.  You get shot in the eye with a beanbag.  Right.  Yeah.  But it's the same type of thing.  You're bummed out for a little while, and then, okay, you've got to move on with your life.  And it moves on.  That's all.  It's not like the country turned to communism because of the election.  Mr. President, I hope you take what we were saying. 
[01:35:00]  You lost.  He's not listening to you, John.  He's not listening.  He's got his own problem.  Let's take another peek at Kerry from yesterday.  Big applause break.  In America, it is vital that every vote count and that every vote be counted.  All right.  But the outcome should be decided by voters, not a protracted legal process. 
[01:35:30]  I would not give up this fight if there was a chance that we would prevail.  It's over, Johnny.  And it is now clear that even when all the provisional ballots are counted, which they  will be, there won't be enough outstanding votes for us to be able to win Ohio.  No shit, Sherlock.  Look at the map.  It was all red.  Dunsky.  Dunsky.  That same corny quote that his dumb vice president, all the votes will be counted and we'll count  every vote.  We get it.  Every vote.  Every vote will count and be counted on the vote of the count. 
[01:36:00]  Uh, cliched ass.  And the count will vote.  Boo.  We cannot.  Boo.  So much.  My friends, it was here that we began our campaign for the presidency.  It's over, Johnny.  And all we had was hope and a vision for a better America.  It's over, Johnny.  It was a privilege and a gift to spend two years traveling this country.  You're just a tool.  I need to know so many of you. 
[01:36:30]  I wish that I could just wrap you up in my arms and embrace each and every one of you  individually all across this nation.  John.  I thank you.  John.  Just walk away.  From the bottom of my heart.  John.  Just walk away.  Yeah.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Yeah.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Yeah.  Just walk away, John.  Hello.  Hello. 
[01:37:00]  Hello.  Hello.  It's over.  Thank you.  Thank you.  His last hurrah.  Where's he going?  What do you think he'll do?  Senator.  Back to the state senator.  You think back to the...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another...  Yeah.  Another also-ran.  Another little checkmark in history.  We still got your back.  Thank you, man.  Still got your back.  Someone yelled.  He was probably wrestled to the floor and thrown out of the place right after that. 
[01:37:30]  Some drunk Boston dude was probably got a socks hat on.  Yeah.  And we still have yours.  Go socks!  We still got you.  Now!  Unhand me!  I'm particularly grateful to the colleague who you just heard from, who became my partner,  my lover, my very close friend, an extraordinary leader, John Edwards, and I thank you very much.  Rich Voss.  Is there anything else in this thing?  This is good stuff.  Oh, yeah.  John Edwards.  He's such a dullard. 
[01:38:00]  He's awful.  He's horrible.  Just a bore.  Even if he's gracious, you want to smash his face.  If he had some kind of charisma, anything.  If he had a plus in one column, just something to latch on to.  I would be the first to tell you that we owe so much to our families.  They're here with us today.  They were with us every single step of the way.  They sustained us.  Uh, John?  They went out on their own and they multiplied our campaign all across this country. 
[01:38:30]  All across.  No one did this more with grace, with courage and candor that I love.  With a tighter ass, John.  Everyone's taking the bumper stickers off their cars.  Yeah.  It's over.  They're out there with the butter knife, the spackle knife, the widget, the little razor blade widget,  just scraping that Kerry Edwards sticker off of their car.  They're hosing down the stage for the next Democrat.  That's it.  Grooming the next one. 
[01:39:00]  Trying to go find Dukakis.  You got four years.  You got four years, Democrats, to work on something.  And our children were there every single step of the way.  Yeah.  It was unbelievable.  Vanessa, Alex, Chris, Andre, and John from my family, and Elizabeth Edwards,  who was so remarkable and so strong.  Name everyone that no one tells you about.  By the way, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea. 
[01:39:30]  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Who went out there on her own just like my brother's name.  Holding the magic mirror.  And I see Petey and Bobby and Jimmy and Jill.  Donna and Betty and Bobby and Phil.  All right.  Well, enough of that, right?  I want to thank my crewmates and my friends from 35 years ago.  Oh, that great band of brothers who crossed the country of my path for 2010.  My fellow goop killers. 
[01:40:00]  You know, someone once asked me, how do you kill women and children?  And I said, it's easy.  You just don't lead them as much.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I got me 75 confirmed goops killed.  I see you wearing your ear necklace.  That's right.  You know, people asked me once, how can you tell people, innocent people from VC, and I 
[01:40:30]  don't remember the fucking line, how can you tell civilians from VC?  And then all across the miles of this can.  All right.  If they run, they're VC.  If they stand still, they're well-disciplined VC.  Yeah, well-disciplined. 
[01:41:00]  Classic.  And that's it for Kerry.  That's it.  He's been put in the CD case and thrown in the garbage.  That's his speech.  Good night.  Bye-bye.  It's over, Jenny.  No, we'll remember you just like we remembered Dukakis.  Sure.  And Lieberman.  Sure, he will.  Lieberman.  Edwards just becomes another Lieberman.  Hey, Lieberman.  Who was Dukakis' guy again?  Dukakis had Mondale, right?  No, Lloyd Benson.  Oh, Benson.  No, right?  What?  Mondale and Ferrara took a 49-1 state beating. 
[01:41:30]  Reagan mauled them.  All right.  Well, now we got a little bit of Bush's speech.  Ooh.  Bush.  Get to the part where he goes, and then we're just going to take a couple of states and  put blacks in them.  I was frightened during this speech when he was talking about all the people that voted  for Kerry.  Oh, yeah.  I thought he was going to say that he was going to hunt you down and kill you.  I will hunt you down.  Listen to this.  Mr. Trump is ready to see you. 
[01:42:00]  What the hell is this?  That's the president's speech, Opie?  That sounds a little awful.  What is this?  Did I mess up?  Bush victory speech.  Well, that doesn't sound like it to me.  What was it?  I don't know.  Let's see.  Give track two.  Give track two a little whirl.  Mr. Trump is ready to see you.  That's the Trump thing.  Oh, all right.  Can we play that already?  This is Bush. 
[01:42:30]  Sieg Heil.  Sieg Heil.  Sieg Heil.  Sieg Heil.  Thank you all for coming.  O-N-A.  You hear them?  They're fans of the show.  We had a long night and a great night.  The voters turned out in record numbers and delivered an historic victory.  Earlier today, Senator Kerry called with his congratulations. 
[01:43:00]  We had a really good phone call.  He was very gracious.  Senator Kerry waged a spirited campaign.  And he and his supporters...  Spirited means asinine.  Pointless.  Pointless campaign.  Laura and I wish Senator Kerry and Theresa and their whole family all our best wishes. 
[01:43:30]  No, he doesn't.  He could care less.  He could care less about the other side, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  America has spoken.  And I'm humbled by the trust and the confidence of my fellow citizens.  With that trust comes a duty to serve all Americans.  And I will do my best to fulfill that duty.  Duty.  Every day as your president.  I want to thank the thousands of our supporters across our country.  I want to thank you for your hugs on the rope lines. 
[01:44:00]  I want to thank you for your prayers on the rope lines.  I want to thank you for your kind words on the rope lines.  Thoughts and prayers.  I want to thank you for everything you did to make the calls and to put up the signs.  Right.  To talk to your neighbors.  Stop.  And to get out the vote.  Signs, signs everywhere.  The signs.  Because you did the incredible...  We must get rid of the insidious Jew in our community. 
[01:44:30]  Equal to your power.  And the Negro, the Jew uses as its tool of terror.  Equal to your task.  And they will create a mongrel race and both races will be destroyed.  I call on all people, all Christian people, to break the windows of Jewish businesses.  Oh, my God.  And by God, I'll die before I yield one inch. 
[01:45:00]  Old Klan videos.  Boy, those guys didn't fuck around, man.  For historic years, America has been given great tasks.  And faced them with strength and courage.  And I say, no wonder we dragged them behind trucks.  Waddle doodle.  And shown resolve and patience in any kind of war.  Our military has brought justice to the enemy.  And honor to America. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Our nation has defended itself.  And served the freedom of all mankind.  Uh-huh.  I'm proud to lead such an amazing country.  And I'm proud to lead it forward.  Because we have done the hard work, we are entering a season of hope.  We'll continue our economic progress.  We are setting up family camps in the desert. 
[01:46:00]  Get on the boxcars.  You will all be kept together once you arrive at the family camp.  Put your clothes in a pile and take a shower.  Your luggage will meet you there.  People with gold teeth to the left.  Those without fillings to the right.  Dated tax code.  Dick Cheney will give you the thumbs up or the thumbs down.  And the next generation.  And the little shark girl.  We'll make public school.  I'm essential to the war effort.  Is she shuffling snow?  We will all our deepest values of family and faith. 
[01:46:30]  We'll help the emerging democracies of Iraq and Afghanistan.  Rise up against the banker Jew and the shiftless Negro.  So they can grow strength.  Hold on, I've got to take this.  Hi, Laura.  Yeah, I love you, Poopsie.  And defend their freedom.  And then our servicemen and women will come home with the honor they have earned. 
[01:47:00]  With good allies at our side.  We will fight this war on terror with every resource of our national power.  And Fulapulaberg.  Can live in freedom.  What about Russia?  No, no, none of them.  Missing these goals will require the broad support.  Are we done?  NgaklaflaklaNaklaStan, our ally.  They send over two troops.  One's dead, but the other one is serving with honor.  As one of our allies.  We're getting equipment from Oualaba, who is one of our closest allies. 
[01:47:30]  One of our strongest allies.  And the fag nation of England.  Sending over many troops and equipment.  That was a boring speech.  No.  Do you want to hear more or no?  Love it.  No, right?  It's a leader.  Lead this.  He is.  He's leading our country.  Oh, no.  He doesn't go in the garbage pail.  He goes over here. 
[01:48:00]  Because he's the president.  He's now the president again.  A two-termer.  More than his dad did.  Look at that.  There you go.  His dad couldn't pull off the second term.  He couldn't prolong the terror of the first Gulf War into the election.  Remember after the Gulf War, the first Gulf War?  George Bush Sr. was a god.  He was godlike.  His approval rating was one of the highest ever.  It was crazy.  It was insane.  Well, his son learned from that error.  All of a sudden, the, read my lips, no new taxes. 
[01:48:30]  Remember that?  And all of a sudden, his approval rating goes down the crapper.  His son saw what happened to his father.  You have a war.  They love you during the war.  They've got to stick with you.  Well, just extend the war right through the election.  Let me take you on a little journey of my own, Opie, through my divorce.  Remember?  Oh, boy.  Remember, which is another battle.  I'm going to take a break now.  Remember when I was first going through it? 
[01:49:00]  This is when I got uncomfortable.  We were working at N.E.W. for a short period of time, not making too much money, to tell you the truth, to be honest with you.  They brought us on board at a budget.  And I go into divorce proceedings with that earning.  Well, Dominic Barbara, like President Bush, extended the divorce proceedings all the way through my contract negotiations, which was two years later. 
[01:49:30]  And all the way through, up until I signed a new deal, that deal that everyone talked about, because it was a very attractive deal, he knew how to extend the battle to his advantage.  What?  You think it's still in my head?  You think I still mull that over on a daily friggin' basis?  It's the only time I get uncomfortable.  Well, that's what Bush did.  He extended it right through the election. 
[01:50:00]  Learned from his daddy.  All right.  Oh, we're done with the speeches?  Yeah.  Why do you have to keep paying?  You shouldn't have to keep paying.  You've been divorced for a while.  It's like it should be over.  Maybe for a year or so.  Huh?  What?  Who?  Just in general.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Pat's been separated and divorced for, I don't even know, like six years now.  About six years.  Are you still paying?  How long are you supposed to pay alimony for?  How many years?  That's all sorted out.  In a general, is there really a time limit for people?  No.  See, the more money you make or have, the longer you'll pay. 
[01:50:30]  That's pretty much how it works.  There's no rule of thumb.  No.  Except the thumb I want to plunge into my eyeball every time I think about it.  But wait, women can just go out and get a new job and stuff like that and have their  own rent and they're still going to collect a check.  Exactly.  For doing...  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And they're not even obligated to give up the box anymore?  There you go.  Alimony wouldn't be so bad if you still had the right.  If you could take the drive over with no notice.  Yeah.  Pull out your mule and go, it looks a little dry, doesn't it? 
[01:51:00]  And she's got to go, good point.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  There you go.  And then you glue the check to her forehead.  That's the way for all couples.  They spit on the forehead and slap the check on there.  The guy just gets screwed in all that.  Yeah.  Of course he does.  It's unbelievable.  But then the women out there want to be looked at as equals.  Of course they do.  You want to be an equal?  When a divorce happens, you go your separate ways.  You go get a job, whatever, and the guy goes and continues what he's doing.  Especially if there's no kids. 
[01:51:30]  You split the bank account down the middle.  So you don't go to the bank and withdraw all the money out of the bank.  No.  You don't go to the bank.  All right.  All right.  We're going there?  Because I was with you that day, and I got to tell you, it was the funniest and saddest  day I've ever spent with Anthony.  Oh, my God.  The funniest and saddest day.  I was in shock.  Anthony and I are doing this radio show, and all hell is going on behind the scenes with  his personal life.  Oh, my God.  And it's getting very obvious that there was going to be lawyers involved and stuff. 
[01:52:00]  So I look at Anthony one day as we're getting ready for the show, literally a half hour before  the show, and I go, how much money you got in your bank account, that joint account of  yours?  And what was it, honestly?  It was, Opie, it was every penny I had saved in my entire life.  Right.  At that point in my life, it was every cent I had saved in my whole life, and it was  a grand total of 40 large.  40,000.  40 Gs.  So I go to Anthony.  Which was, you know, for me, especially since up until a few years before that, before I 
[01:52:30]  even got into radio, before I came to NEW, I had, like, nothing.  I was working for a living with, you know, if I can keep 1,200 bucks in my bank account,  it was a miracle.  No, it's so pathetic.  Like, we kicked ass in Boston, and we both came home with barely bank accounts.  Yeah, I had nothing.  I had, like, maybe 30,000, 40,000 as well.  That job gave me the privilege of paying off some credit card debt.  That was pretty much it.  And not even all the credit card debt.  We came to New York with really not much money in the bank and stuff.  So I'm looking at Anthony. 
[01:53:00]  I'm like, how much money is in that joint account of yours, you know?  And he's like, I don't know, about 40,000.  I'm like, dude, you know, she's getting lawyers involved, it looks like.  Why don't we go to the bank?  This is a true story.  I was the one who told you.  I go, why don't we go to the bank, and why don't you take some of that money out?  And you being the good guy, I swear this is the truth.  Ant goes, you know what?  I will go, and I'm going to take half the money out.  I'm going to take 20 grand.  I figured I'm going to go and take 20 grand out.  Because I'm a good guy.  I'm going to take half out and leave the other half for her.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, I get there, and I write out my little withdrawal slip.  Dude, it was so funny and so sad. 
[01:53:30]  And I'm sitting there as Ant's doing the withdrawal slip and stuff.  $20,000 withdrawal.  Here's my account number.  Let me get my ID.  I walk up to the counter.  Hello.  How are you today?  Give it a little slip.  Does some typing.  Looks at the monitor.  I'm there, you know, clearing out some spots in my wallet.  Well, I mean, it's going to be a hell of a wad.  I better.  I'm just trying to figure out if you wanted a large bills or maybe a check.  Can you see where this is headed? 
[01:54:00]  Right.  Is there any mystery left in this story?  I'm sorry, Mr. Kumia.  There seems to be $42 in your account.  She took $40,000.  She took the $40,000.  Before they even started negotiating the divorce.  The whole thing.  The whole wad.  How does that happen?  How does the judge not go, all right, well, where's 20 of that money?  Not only does that happen, but then you have to go to court, and then they have to tell 
[01:54:30]  you how much out of now the pay that you're getting, that money's gone.  Now I have to re-save and try to build up my account again, but out of the money that I'm  making, money's got to come out of that to go to her, as like support payments, they  call it.  And that's what you've got to go through.  Not only did I take your 40 G's, but, eh, going to have to pay out of your paycheck.  This is what happens to a man in a divorce.  They get screwed over.  It's an amazing thing that you have to go through. 
[01:55:00]  It's amazing.  And there are options to that, and sometimes some guys don't want to get raked over the  coals, so they figure, well, maybe a rowboat and an anchor, and a little fishing expedition.  Is that Chris Rockspin?  Oh, yeah.  You understand.  I understand.  I wouldn't kill her, but I understand.  But I understand.  Talking about O.J. Simpson.  So, Jim, I'm sitting in the bank, and I know what's going on just from the body language.  I start laughing harder than I've ever laughed.  Oh, he's laughing at me.  Inside.  Inside.  And then I've got to be there for my pal.  I'm out 40 G's.  And then I look at him, and then I was really sad for him. 
[01:55:30]  But I started laughing, and then I'm like, oh, my God.  I cannot believe this is going on.  You know what I looked like when we were walking back to the studio?  He didn't even have money for lunch.  And we're becoming big radio stars in New York.  At that point, Anthony had absolutely no money to his name except what he had in his wallet,  which I don't think he had much of that day.  Let me give you a visual of what I looked like walking back.  Picture the scene in Jaws where Sheriff Brody is trying to get the mayor to sign that paper  after the last shark attack. 
[01:56:00]  And the mayor's like, my son was in that water, too.  Just sign it.  Close the beaches.  But I'm doing it for the citizens.  That was me.  I was gone.  I was, oh, I had 40, I was kid, we got to go, I can't do a show.  We could go old school.  You look like Dr. Bellows.  Dr. Bellows.  Remember Dr. Bellows from I Dream of Jeannie?  Yeah.  Whenever he would always see Jeannie appear or disappear,  and Tony was trying to explain to him what happened, and he's like, but, 
[01:56:30]  and then I looked, and there was a woman.  And then when I came, she was gone, but the box was here, and all of a sudden,  and you came in, but that was gone, and I, that was me.  Just confusion.  Oh, it was awful.  I had no clue what to do.  None.  The best part about that whole thing was when she was claiming that she made you a radio star.  What?  That she had something to do with it.  It was amazing. 
[01:57:00]  Once you get into court when you're divorced, getting a divorce,  the lawyer for the wife will always...  I had to hand over old tapes of our shows at BAB,  because she was trying to prove that she helped Anthony's career.  They try to get what's called future earnings.  So what the lawyer will do is say,  all right, your earning potential for the rest of your life is X amount of dollars,  and she has a right to some of that money.  So they will give a percentage to her based on what you might earn in the future,  and you've got to pay that. 
[01:57:30]  That's why I decided to settle.  And that's what happened.  But how are they going to screw you?  And I'm trying to say, look, I might not make a dime.  You know, I might do something stupid on our show and get fired.  That's exactly what happened.  You know?  So the laws for divorce are so screwed.  So many guys get raked over the cold.  I'm lucky because, you know, yeah, it costs me a lot of money,  but at least I make a good wage. 
[01:58:00]  You know, it's not like I'm the guy making, you know, $30,000 and you've got to give a half.  Now you're living on $15,000, you know.  That's pretty rough.  That is really rough.  But for some reason, yeah, we want to be equals.  I don't want the corporate glass ceiling.  I want to make as much, you know.  We want to be respected in the corporate world.  We want this, that.  You want it, then no more divorce laws that are against the guys all the time. 
[01:58:30]  What?  Huh?  What?  They don't contribute creatively ever.  Here's what they should say in court.  How big is his bag?  All right, you drained it a little bit.  That's what you contributed to the relationship.  There you go.  Weigh my bag.  You're a bag drainer.  All women are bag drainers.  Another scene out of Jaws.  Quint, I'll never get married again.  It's like putting on that life jacket.  After you're swimming around, watching people get plucked off. 
[01:59:00]  He bobbed up and down and then turned over.  He was bitten in half at the waist.  His wife did it.  Took half the son of a bitch.  I'll never get married again.  Paycheck goes in the water.  Wife's in the water.  My wife.  Farewell and a dude to have your pay. 
[01:59:30]  Awful.  Yeah.  Here she comes.  Look out.  We're going to need a bigger paycheck.  I don't want to open the shark and have that settlement spill out all over the dock.  Oh, brother.  And you will pay that alibi. 
[02:00:00]  God damn.  Yeah.  Wow.  Drag me under like that little Kittner boy.  I'll say.  All right.  What do we got next, Ben?  She can't stay down with three alimony checks in her pocket.  I'm trying to think of something funny to go show me the way to go home.  I can't come up with it. 
[02:00:30]  I'm tired.  I don't want to go to bed.  All right.  Well, I guess the lesson there, yes.  Don't get married.  Don't ever get married.  Ben, why are you riding on a big board?  Yeah, what are you doing, Ben?  Talk.  That's very easy to communicate with the guys behind the...  How about walking in there and just barking out orders?  You're the boss.  Are they going to play the Chris Rock clip?  Yeah.  That's cool.  That's cool.  All right.  What do we have next on the show, though?  What do we have next on the show?  We have Rich Everett who wrote a book about rock stars that crashed in play crashes. 
[02:01:00]  No, but we have stuff about Randy Rhoads, Jim.  Good boy.  Oh.  Are we going to talk to him?  Okay.  And then we've got a reporter from More Sugar, which is a publication Westchester is here.  Oh, is that the guy?  Yeah.  He's laughing, so I think he's enjoying the show a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  No, definitely.  And then the hot blonde.  That's Erica who brought the lesbian couch, which we weren't allowed to bring up until  after 8 o'clock.  So was he Pat Cooper drunk at the front desk?  Why were we interfering with his detox?  Stupid asshole.  No couch is coming through before 8 o'clock. 
[02:01:30]  He told me that.  Tell them.  I'm not telling them shit, motherfucker.  I'm not your message of service.  Right away, boss.  I'll tell Opie and Anthony, no couch coming through here.  Let me shuffle off and tells him.  We're kind of getting along with that guy lately.  Yeah, I don't like him.  It's the first moment I've really hated his guts.  Yeah, I don't really like him either.  For some reason, we have security cards when we come into the building, and they're used  for the elevator.  You're sweeping in front of something, and you could hit the floor you want to go to.  And some days, he's not even there.  He's not at the desk.  He's sleeping in the back, sleeping off a vodka drunk or something. 
[02:02:00]  So I just walk into the elevator, beep, swipe the card, hit the button.  But for some reason, if he's sitting at the desk, I sign in, and he goes, I got to see  your card.  Yeah, he says card really weird, too.  Yeah.  Got to see a card.  Card.  Card.  Then he takes the card, swipes it somewhere behind the desk, and you hear a beep, and  then he gives it back to you.  But apparently, that's not necessary, because when he's not there, there's no sweeping of  the card, and I get up just fine.  I love the names that we sign in.  Have you seen some of them?  Oh, my God.  Curt Schilling?  Tom Brady?  I saw President Bush.  Somebody signed in as President Bush. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  There's always a theme to the sign-in sheet.  Ben was every red sock for about a week.  Johnny David.  Oh, Johnny David's here?  No, it's just Ben.  Tomorrow, I'm going to be Yasser Arafat.  Oh, look at him blowing kisses with those.  Yeah, and someone's got to hold his hand and move it to his mouth.  Dirty cinnamon lips.  Papa Smurf, still wearing that hat.  He's in a coma, I heard.  He's got that pubic hair, beard, and mustache going for him.  He's not in a coma.  He just wants out. 
[02:03:00]  They're getting him to the Bahamas.  He's in a coma.  Yeah, he might be in a coma, Ope.  All right.  Shouldn't make light of it.  You know what happens.  Okay, so we'll talk to Falling Stars, the author of Falling Stars, Air Crashers that  Filled Rock and Roll Heaven.  Yeah, that's kind of morbid.  We got the retard news, which is just unbelievable.  And we got the girl with the lesbian couch, and lots of stuff to do.  I don't know if we're going to get to everything for once.  That's cool.  All right.  Wife came in looking for my check with black eyes, lifeless eyes, like a doll's eyes. 
[02:03:30]  Hear that horrible high-pitched screaming and hollering as she takes your check.  Everyone just keeps pounding, pounding.  Sometimes she goes away.  Sometimes she don't go away.  Just hear that pounding and horrible high-pitched screaming.  Come in and tear your paycheck to pieces.  It's August 2002. 
[02:04:00]  Let's drink to your lawyer.  Let's drink to my lawyer.  All of a sudden, Okie Bar, Boston.  Fat lawyer come in, grab my paycheck, poured it out of my pocket.  Check this out.  Steve from New Hampshire.  Guys definitely get screwed in a divorce.  F yeah.  Get this.  My wife left me for the lesbian next door.  Oh, that's a cute story.  And somehow in New Hampshire, when that happens, it's not considered adultery. 
[02:04:30]  Can you imagine if I did the same thing?  Wow, if you leave for a lesbian next door, it's not adultery?  In New Hampshire, I guess.  If you're a chick.  Well, there.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, sure.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  A lot of racial shit, this shit.  A lot of racial shit.  What was the big thing?  O.J.  O.J. was big.  That's right.  Black people too happy, white people too mad.  White people are like, bam, this is bullshit.  I ain't seen white people that mad since they canceled M.A.S.H. 
[02:05:00]  Black people way too happy.  Like, hey, we won.  We won.  Yeah, we won.  What the fuck did we win?  Every day I look in the mailbox for my O.J. prize.  Nothing.  Nothing.  And, ooh, it's all about race.  That shit wasn't about race.  That shit was about fame.  Because if O.J. wasn't famous, he'd be in jail right now.  If O.J. drove a bus.  If O.J. drove a bus, he wouldn't even be O.J. 
[02:05:30]  He'd be O.Renthal, the bus driving murderer.  And, ooh, the jury's so stupid.  Fight the fuck out of here, man.  They're so stupid.  How could they not?  White people would have done the exact same shit.  Okay?  The exact same shit.  Because if that was Jerry Seinfeld, charged with double murder, and the only person that 
[02:06:00]  found the glove just happened to be in the Nation of Islam, Jerry be a free man, be eating  cereal right now.  But let's break down the case.  What's the guy, Ron Goldman?  That was her boyfriend.  Okay?  Don't be mistaken and think it was just some guy returning glasses.  Okay?  When was the last time you left some shit in a restaurant and they brought it back to your 
[02:06:30]  house?  Okay?  Shit, I want to eat there.  Shit, you can leave a newborn baby in a restaurant and they'll put him in a coat room.  Second of all, he was known to drive around town in this Ferrari that O.J. bought for  her.  Think about that shit.  I'll buy you a car.  You're going to let another man drive around in my car?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Shit.  What?  You better recognize. 
[02:07:00]  Shit, I don't even have a Ferrari.  But if I saw somebody driving my Pinto, that shit would blow up like the Godfather.  And I'm not saying he should have killed her, but I understand.  You know what else?  O.J. is paying $25,000 a month in alimony. 
[02:07:30]  $25,000.  $25,000 and $4,000 a month for food.  For food.  What the fuck was she eating?  For four grand a month.  I guess she's like, I got to get some extra cheese on my wife.  Yeah, women, y'all got it good, boy.  When it's time to get a divorce, women got it made.  They go to court, start talking that shit.  Your honor, I'm used to this.  I'm used to that.  I'm accustomed to this.  Yo, what the fuck is accustomed?  What that got to do with shit? 
[02:08:00]  Hey, you got a restaurant.  You're accustomed to eating.  You leave.  You ain't eating no more.  They don't owe you a steak.  I want to go to court.  Pop that shit.  Your honor, I'm used to this.  I'm used to that.  I want some money.  Give me some money.  They get the money.  What about what the man's used to?  What about what the man's accustomed to?  That might not be money, but during the course of a relationship, a man grows accustomed to a few things. 
[02:08:30]  And I would love to see a man go to court and say, your honor, check this out.  You know, I'm accustomed to fucking her four times away.  Now I feel I should be able to fuck at least twice away.  I mean, she could have had an alimony, but I want some pussy payments. 
[02:09:00]  That's right, man.  Shit.  You know what?  That's alimony.  That's what made OJ crap.  That oil alimony.  She paid that big ass alimony.  He ain't scored a touchdown in 20 years.  That's right.  I should have had a prenup.  That's right.  Prenuptual agreement.  Everybody needs a prenup.  People think you got to be rich to get a prenup.  Oh, no.  You got 20 million. 
[02:09:30]  Your wife won 10.  Big deal.  You ain't starving.  But if you make 30,000, and your wife won 15, you might have to kill her.  I ain't going to move back with my mama because you ain't in love.  You going to have to die.  So you got to think about OJ's situation. 
[02:10:00]  25,000 a month.  Another man driving around.  His car fucking his wife.  And a house he's still paying a mortgage on.  Now, I'm not saying he should have killed her.  But I understand.  But I understand.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bubby, Hockey, Bubby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, niggas.  We're about to take all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is fuck my dick because they ain't give me no money. 
[02:10:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM Radio, cash up.  All day, everything.  Get that bitch, niggas.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch.  Shit, I tried boxing for a little while and shit.  Yeah, I tried everything to get some pussy down.  Ladies, y'all don't know.  Y'all got heaven between the legs.  Y'all probably do know.  You know what I'm saying?  Y'all got your own private ATM machine. 
[02:11:00]  Dick go in, money come out.  You know what I'm saying?  If there's a broke woman in here, something wrong with your dumb ass.  Because if you're a woman, there ain't no need for you to ever be broke.  Especially when you got what a nigga need.  Let me ask your motherfucking mind.  You know, you see a woman walk around complaining, saying, I ain't got nothing, blah, blah, blah, blah, shit. 
[02:11:30]  What's wrong with your pussy is my first question.  You know, it's exciting, you know, being in the show business.  It's exciting, you know.  I like going home because I can show off when I go home.  But some brothers break my face.  Nigga, you ain't shit.  You wasn't shit when you was here.  I seen you do that shit on.  That's the same shit you do around the pool, nigga.  It ain't nothing. 
[02:12:00]  Let me have a dollar.  You owe me that.  And there's always some girl when you go home and you're home dumb, dumb.  And you know you ain't sending that girl no money for that baby.  Know that's your baby, don't you?  Look just like you.  You're going to see the baby with blonde, blue hair. 
[02:12:30]  Blonde, blue hair.  It's a terrible baby.  Starbucks is on XM.  Ever notice the eclectic mix of great music playing at Starbucks?

How are the U2 fans feeling about the new U2?  Are they digging it?  Or are they like, man...  No, I'm a big U2 fan.  I'm loving the new song.  And they're saying this album's going to be amazing.  They're saying this is the weakest song on the album.  Yep.  Really?  Because it's a huge hit. 
[02:15:30]  Well, it's very poppy, you know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think it sounds like old school.  Your brother and I were talking about it the night it came out because we were up in Boston.  It's got like a Vines...  It's got like that younger Alterna Bruxon.  But I think it sounds like...  Definitely doesn't sound like, you know, aging rockers trying to be hip.  Sounds pretty good.  They're still hip.  They've been at it about 25 years already.  That's amazing.  They're going to be in New York.  What?  What?  What?  Jimmy hates YouTube, man.  I honestly don't like it.  Yeah, shut up.  But you don't like anything that's new.  Not true at all.  It's not Aussie, dude.  It's not Aussie. 
[02:16:00]  Actually, Jim likes what?  Do you like two bands?  Do you like Godsmack and Aussie?  I love Sabbath.  Kiss.  I love old Kiss.  It's a new stuff.  I turned you on to White Stripes.  You liked that for a while, right?  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Lead Belly.  Lead Belly.  What's that, 1930?  Yeah, is there anything new that you like?  Any new bands?  A guy named Dan Byrne I like a lot.  He's like an alternative guy.  Yeah, him I like very much, but no, most of the music I don't like.  All right.  Hey, the lesbian couch has arrived.  Ooh!  We're building the new Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:16:30]  We've got to get everything back together where it was two and a half years ago.  Remember when this was Frank's place, Opie?  Yeah, well, it's not Frank's place anymore.  We're kind of really changing it around.  I like it.  Well, where's the couch going to go?  We'll figure that out.  Right in there, right?  Under the big window that we look at Steve and Eric through.  Oh, they're going to hate it, too, because the interns can't see from that window.  No.  So they're not going to be happy.  All right, if we've got the lesbian couch today, we're going to bring her in in a little while.  We've got to get a girl to, you know, christen the thing.  Break it in.  Tomorrow we're going to have girls christening a lesbian couch.  Three of them?  Three? 
[02:17:00]  Cocksucker, I'm going to be on a plane.  Oh, God.  No, we'll bring it in in a little while there, because we've got to talk to Rich Everett.  Oh, great.  We're doing this, and poor Jimmy's got to fly?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've got a nice switch through Houston tomorrow to go to Sacramento.  Oh.  What are you playing?  I don't want to talk about where I'm playing with the punchline.  Who cares?  It's not relevant to this radio show today.  Big deal.  Ticket's still available.  So what?  Big deal, Sacramento.  Oh, Sacramento, because there's a lot of punchlines. 
[02:17:30]  Well, no, there's a punchline in Atlanta, which I'm not doing.  I'm not doing the punchline in San Francisco.  But if you're in Sacramento and you want to come see your show, I'll be there.  All right, let's say hi to Rich.  Big deal.  There you go.  That's funny.  Hey, Rich.  Yeah, man.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, Jimmy, flying somewhere tomorrow?  Hi, Rich.  Yes, I am.  All right, Jimmy, listen to me very carefully.  You know, I'm an expert on airplane crashes.  Just written this book, Air Crashes that filled rock and roll heaven.  Look, there's a safety tip you need to know before you get on that airplane to protect yourself.  Oh.  Are you ready?  Here's what you do. 
[02:18:00]  And this goes for all you guys.  I know you guys do a lot of flying, but, Jimmy, particularly tomorrow, when you get on that airplane, when you get on the airplane and you're walking out that little skinny aisle in between all the chairs, I want you to look around the cabin very, very carefully.  Particularly up in first class, if you see a rock star sitting there, get off the airplane.  Why?  Aren't they only killed on private, like those smaller planes?  Actually, most of them have died on small, charted airplanes.  Walter Hyatt of Uncle Walt's band, he was actually killed on the flight that went down in the Everglades a few years ago. 
[02:18:30]  That was one of the few commercial flights that have taken the life of a value jet crash, yeah.  There was also a soap star on that plane, too, right?  Or there was some soap guy, I think, on that plane.  You know what?  If they want a rock singer, I don't know about him.  Oh, okay.  Good man.  Rich, your goal on the show today is to scare the hell out of Jim Norton, because he hates flying as it is.  Oh, don't scare him, Jimmy.  We're going to take care of that right now.  I won't be scared.  I've flown enough, and I'm obsessed with plane crashes, and so I definitely read a lot and watch a lot about them. 
[02:19:00]  I feel pretty safe on Continental.  You know, the commercial, actually, the commercial airlines, you're safer there than in your own bed, particularly in Jimmy's case, rather than his own bed.  This guy listens to the show.  What about planes that tend to get the rock stars, you know, the private chartered planes?  Well, let me ask you a question, because I'm an Aussie fanatic, so Randy Rhoades obviously killed in 82.  Oh, yeah.  Very bad.  What was the story behind it?  I heard he was afraid of flying and then just took a flight with someone. 
[02:19:30]  What was the story behind Rhoades?  He had a knucklehead for a pilot.  Okay.  That's what happened to him.  They had pulled into Leesburg, Florida to do a show at a stadium down there.  The guy who drove their bus was also a pilot.  Now, are you going to trust yourself in an airplane with your bus driver?  Right.  Of course not.  They did.  Went out to the airport.  He was going to take several members of Aussie's entourage just up for a little, you know, fun day of flying.  He took one group up, buzzed a few houses, did some mild aerobatics, landed, and then picked Randy Rhoades and a makeup artist for Aussie up in the airplane. 
[02:20:00]  They took off, buzzed the house near where Aussie's bus was parked, came back around, buzzed the bus again while Aussie and Sharon were asleep on the bus.  The second time they came around, flew too low, the wing of the airplane that Randy was in actually struck the bus where Aussie and Sharon were sleeping, took the wing off, car-quilled the airplane into the house across the street.  Aussie and Sharon woke up from the noise, walked outside to see this conflagration in front of them and the tail of an airplane sticking out of it with Randy Rhoades burning inside. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, she was Sharon's best friend, too, the makeup artist that was killed.  Correct, yeah, yeah, terrible, terrible tragedy, and simply a case of what they call, well, it's one of the most common causes of an airplane crash.  It's called low-maneuvering flight, low and slow maneuvering, and it's extremely dangerous, and you have to be very highly qualified to do it, and apparently this pilot was not. 
[02:21:00]  Wow. What an idiot. Jesus Christ. You figure you're flying a goddamn airplane, you've got to be at the top of your game and not pull any shenanigans.  That sounded like he was pulling some shenanigans.  Yeah, particularly when you're doing low-level flight, where you have very little time or room to recover if anything goes wrong.  Yeah.  You know, that's the kind of thing you leave to the stunt pilots at air shows.  He was just showing off, and he clipped the bus.  Apparently so, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  How about Skinner, Leonard Skinner?  That was in 77, right? That was on a charter plane.  Leonard Skinner, oh my God, what a crash.  Artemis Pyle, Leonard Skinner's drummer, was very helpful in writing this chapter, because he is not only a survivor and band member,  he is also a licensed pilot and had flown that airplane, and so he could talk about in the book, Falling Stars, not only what happened from the view of a survivor,  but also from the view of a pilot, what was going on inside the airplane.  He was actually in the cockpit with the pilots when both motors on their airplane went out simultaneously. 
[02:22:00]  He said the pilot turned to him, and you could see the terror in his eyes, and he said,  Artemis, if you want to live, you better go in the back and buckle up.  And at that moment, Artemis told me, he felt the hand of destiny on his shoulder,  because both his father and father-in-law had died in airplane crashes.  Oh, I thought destiny was a hippie chick on the plane, banging all the guys.  Yeah, go find destiny.  Felt the hand of destiny on his shoulder, and then the mouth of destiny on his penis. 
[02:22:30]  This is your last shot at it, buddy.  Hey, groovy.  Now, you want something that will really give you the spooks?  I know we're already past Halloween.  Hold on, let us get some jokes through our heads first.  Wait, something that will give us the spooks.  All right.  Ed King.  I'm big dick black.  Yeah.  Was a guitar player for Leonard Skinner, one of the original guitar army.  They called him, they had three guitar players.  Ed King was not on the airplane. 
[02:23:00]  He has one of those stories that some people can tell about,  hey, I was supposed to have been on that plane.  Right, everyone's got one of those.  He retired shortly before the tour, the final tour, which, ironically, if you'll recall,  was called the Survivor's Tour.  Oh, that's right.  So Ed was not on the airplane.  He retired.  They hired a guy named Steve Gaines to replace him.  Steve Gaines is on the plane in Ed King's seat.  The plane goes down.  Steve Gaines is killed.  Ouch.  Ed King began thinking about it later and decided, you know, Steve Gaines, 
[02:23:30]  sitting in my seat, played my solos in the concert, he felt a kinship with him,  decided to go to Steve Gaines' grave and pay his private, personal respects.  So in the book Falling Stars, Air Crashes that Filled Rock and Roll Heaven,  we quote Ed King as to what happened at Steve Gaines' grave.  He goes to Steve Gaines' grave, looks down at the tombstone of the man who took his place  in the band, played his parts in the concert, and was sitting in his seat on the airplane  and died in his place. 
[02:24:00]  And on the tombstone, he was astonished to see they share exactly the same birth day, month,  and year.  Oh, spooky.  And then the hand came out of the grave and grabbed him, grabbed him by the ankle.  Oh, he tried to run away.  You know, it's weird.  A lot of these crashes have just strange little ironies, coincidences, and oddities. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, but before you get into that, what happened to the Leonard Skinner plane?  How did that go down?  Well, it lost both engines.  You're not going to believe this.  Lost both engines?  Yes, simultaneously.  How the hell does that happen?  When you pull up to the gas pump, if you're ready to take a long trip, what do you do?  Hey, give me some gas, right.  I'd go to the rest area and meet someone.  Oh, sorry.  The Leonard Skinner airplane gave out of gas.  It was just out of, it ran out of gas.  It just, out of gas, miles from their destination, crashed into a swamp in southern Mississippi right 
[02:25:00]  at nightfall.  Well, did the pilots sense that they were running out of gas, or was there a problem  with the fuel gauge?  Well, he did when the motors stopped.  That was the first indicator that he didn't see the red.  Apparently, that was the first indication the pilots had.  I've never heard this before, that they ran out of gas.  It must have been the fuel gauge was messed up.  I heard it was an old plane.  Someone else had that plane before Skinner, right?  Well, yeah.  What happened was, they actually had tried to lease Jerry Lee Lewis' airplane. 
[02:25:30]  They had, on the previous tours, they'd been flying in Jerry Lee Lewis' airplane.  At the last moment, the deal for his airplane fell through, so the leasing company found them  another plane, sort of a lesser cousin to the plane that they wanted.  And as Artemis says in the book, Falling Stars, he said, so we went out to the airport.  We knew it wasn't as good a plane as we wanted, but by golly, we got out there, and they had  painted the Leonard Skinner logo across the nose cone, and hey, who could resist that?  So they took a plane that they didn't actually want, and it ended up, it had a bad right 
[02:26:00]  engine, was spewing fire out of the right engine, and apparently was burning a lot more  fuel than that motor was supposed to be burning.  Oh, so maybe that's why they ran out.  Yeah, and the pilots had not monitored the fuel carefully, and boy, apparently the first  thing they knew, it ran out of gas.  And when you go back and listen to the, or read the transcripts of the pilots talking  to air traffic control, which we put in the book, clearly the first indication of any 
[02:26:30]  trouble was when the motors stopped running.  That's a good indication.  That would tip me off right there.  Hey, what about John Denver's crash?  Boy, John Denver.  John Denver.  What a dope.  Wasn't it like a homemade airplane or something like that?  Yeah, it was.  It's a great airplane, and in fact, it's designed by a guy named Burt Rutan.  Does that ring a bell?  Yeah, sure does.  Burt Rutan just won the X Prize for inventing and putting the first private spaceship up into  space.  How great would it have been to send John Denver into space and leave him there? 
[02:27:00]  He tried.  He tried.  The civilians in space program, he was instrumental in getting that going because he wanted to  go into space.  And up until the very last moment, he thought he was going to be the first civilian in space.  But ultimately, Ronald Reagan chose Krista McAuliffe instead.  Yes, we all know how well that worked out.  Yeah.  Saved John Denver's life that he was not on board the shuttle that blew up.  But John Denver's airplane, a fabulously designed airplane, it's called a Long Easy. 
[02:27:30]  It's made out of modern composite material.  A two-place airplane.  You sit front and back.  The motor is in the back.  The little wing is on the front.  The big wing is in the back.  It kind of looks like it's flying backwards when you see it fly.  A canard.  A canard design.  That's exactly right.  It looks very futuristic.  But if you remember, the canard design actually goes all the way back to the right flyer.  They had a canard on the right flyer, the very first motorized airplane.  John Denver made a series of fundamental mistakes on the day he flew. 
[02:28:00]  He was actually piloting his own airplane by himself.  He made so many simple, dumb mistakes that some of the investigators actually wanted to investigate  that crash, not as a crash, but as a suicide.  Oh.  They did not believe that someone as highly qualified to fly airplanes as John Denver  would make that many dumb mistakes in a row.  And what were the mistakes?  I heard a couple of his songs.  Yeah.  What were the mistakes?  Well, the first thing, he had very little experience in that airplane. 
[02:28:30]  He had picked it up the day before, only had about an hour of training in the airplane.  Now, this is an experimental home-built airplane.  In other words, one of a kind.  And the guy who had built it, he didn't build it himself.  Another guy built it, had deviated from the design that Burt Rutan had drawn.  The big problem had to do with a fuel control valve.  Now, on an airplane, you have fuel tanks in each wing, and you have a switch you have 
[02:29:00]  to throw to get the fuel flowing from either the right or the left tank.  Yeah.  That switch on this airplane is supposed to be between the pilot's knees.  Right.  Make up your own joke about that.  But the pilot flies the airplane with his right hand, and he can reach down and continue  to fly the plane, reach down with his left hand, and throw the switch to change tanks  if he starts to run out.  Yeah.  Well, on John Denver's airplane, the man who built it didn't want the fuel switch between  his knees because that meant he had to run fuel lines into the cockpit.  So, he cleverly put the fuel valve in the rear of the airplane along with the motor behind 
[02:29:30]  the firewall.  Yeah, there you go.  That's smart.  A little problem with that.  You can't reach it.  So, what he did was, he designed this Rube Goldberg-ish system of rods and U-joints that went from  the fuel control valve in the rear of the airplane all the way up through the rear cabin through  the front cabin and mounted a remote handle above the pilot's left shoulder.  So, when John Denver got in the air, before, actually, before he got in the air, he did 
[02:30:00]  not realize how low his fuel was.  He took off with almost no fuel.  He had been offered, a guy came over, a mechanic came over and offered to build the plane up.  He says, no, I've got enough fuel.  Couldn't read the fuel gauges.  They were in the cockpit behind him.  Descriptions in real time.  I know, dude.  You're losing the audience.  You were doing great.  At any rate.  I mean, the detail's killing us.  He couldn't get the fuel gauge, the fuel switch to turn. 
[02:30:30]  While he fought with it, he inadvertently pushed his right rudder pedal, nosed the plane over,  hit Monterey Bay at over 200 miles an hour.  How high was he when he plummeted?  500 feet.  That's it?  He didn't have much room to recover.  All right, yeah.  I'm flying and my tanks are running dry.  I'm plummet.  John Denver, had he accepted the fact that he was not going to be able to turn the fuel gauge  and get more fuel going, and accepted that the plane was not going to restart,  and had simply ditched the airplane in the water, as pilots are trained to do. 
[02:31:00]  Was he a hero steering away from the people?  I love when they say that.  The guy's probably just trying anything to get his plane flying again when they hit the water.  And it's like, he was a hero.  He avoided the populated part of the beach.  What else could the great Santini have done?  Hey, sports fans.  No, actually, he probably never knew he was going down.  He was turned backwards fighting this fuel valve.  But had he just ditched in the water, that airplane is not made out of metal.  It's made out of foam wrapped in fiberglass. 
[02:31:30]  He could have simply popped the hatch, and if they towed him to shore, enjoyed the sun shining on his shoulder.  Not at 200 miles an hour.  You could kind of belly flop it in there?  Yeah, you can.  It's ditching.  You call it ditching, and pilots are trained to do that.  Well, Bull Meacham tried to, but he wound up getting over the water in his plane.  He just went down.  Well, yeah, that's what happens sometimes.  Oh, my goodness.  You can only hope he spun around at the last minute and saw the ocean there six inches from his face.  What happened with JFK Jr., even though he's not a rock star? 
[02:32:00]  Besides the fact that he had a bum leg and he's trying to work a pedal at night.  His girlfriend was yapping to him and yapping on the cell phone and distracting the hell out of him.  That's what happened.  Apparently, JFK Jr., the cause of his crash is the same thing that caused the Buddy Holly crash and the Patsy Cline crash and so many others.  Patsy Cline died in a plane crash?  Yes, along with Hawkshow Hawkins and all those hillbillies.  Two other great country music singers.  What's her big song?  Crazy.  Crazy, okay.  And there is no truth to the rumor that her hit record at the time was I Fall to Pieces. 
[02:32:30]  No truth to that whatsoever.  Let me ask you, now, Otis Redding died in a crash.  Did he really die right after Dock of the Bay?  He did.  Yeah.  And he hit the, they found him in the lake and they, go ahead, you can tell the story.  Yeah, Lake Monona up in Madison, Wisconsin.  And let me correct a terrible misunderstanding about the Otis Redding crash.  He wasn't really black?  Otis Redding did not die in a plane crash.  What, he drowned?  Otis Redding's plane went into the water and almost everyone on board survived the crash 
[02:33:00]  and then drowned before help could get to them.  Wow.  Yeah.  Now, how about that for a bad day?  You survive a plane crash and then you drown before anybody can get to you.  Oddly enough, one person survived that crash.  Their trumpet player, Ben Cauley, survived and lived to actually tell the story of exactly what happened.  Wouldn't be a bad fate compared to sitting here.  He was the only non-swimmer in the bunch.  Who was? 
[02:33:30]  Ben Cauley, the single survivor of that crash.  He wasn't a swimmer.  How did he survive?  He grabbed onto a chair.  I think I'd rather be on a plane at this point.  How?  He grabbed onto a chair and it floated.  A chair out of the airplane and he just hung on for dear life.  Now, let me ask you, Jim Croce, what happened with his plane?  Jim Croce?  Now, a lot of people forget, Jim Croce was not nearly as popular alive as he came after he died.  It was one of those weird things.  Hello?  Yeah, what happened with his plane? 
[02:34:00]  Jim Croce, the last song he recorded was a song, see if you remember this song, called  I Got a Name.  Yeah, of course.  Like the pine trees lining the winding road, I got a name.  I got a name, yeah.  That's the lead line to the song.  And the croaking tone.  It was the last song he played in concert before he got on the airplane.  When you're telling those little stories, here's a good idea.  The pilot took off and hit a stand of trees lining a winding road, and the subsequent  publicity made him a household name.  Oh, all right.  So if it had crashed into a junkyard, they would have been comparing him with Leroy Brown. 
[02:34:30]  So Leroy Brown, there's always something.  You've got to take something out of this.  All right, listen.  This has been wonderful, Rich.  What's your name in the book?  It's called Falling Stars and the Black Branches that Filled Rock and Roll Heaven.  Shut up!  All right.  It's been a pleasure, bro.  Hey, man.  I've enjoyed it.  Thanks very much, man.  Stop whining.  Stay off the airplane if there's a rock star there.  Stop it!  I would like to sit next to him, though, and maybe get a picture like I did with 50 Cent.  I'll be telling that story in Sacramento this weekend.  Jimmy, you know what will happen?  Quiet. 
[02:35:00]  If you sit next to a rock star, you'll simply be the second half of a headline.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop it!  Enough!  Stop whining.  All right, Rich.  We're all going to go and buy Falling Stars, okay?  All righty, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  Bye, mister.  We'll see you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Oh, my God.  This guy's...  It says, uh, this guy sounds like the movie phone guy.  For John Denver's crash, press one.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  I'm like, tired.  How could you not be after that?  No, it was good.  Wow.  It was good, but then he got too technical.  We don't have good attention spans on this show.  Who's piloting Redding's plane?  Susan Smith.  That's funny.  Yeah, we'll bring him the couch.  Toolbag from New Orleans.  That's very funny.  Why don't we bring him the couch next?  Can a rock star please crash this plane into this guy's house?  Talk about drowning.  How about the show?  The listener's really enjoying it. 
[02:36:00]  Ping pong.  It was good for a while, no?  I thought he...  I like the Randy Rhoads story.  Oh, Sean Smith from Philly.  Could you please put the Kerry speeches back on?  Oh, that is really funny.  Did you guys bring back Bad Guest Day and not tell us?  I'm just reading instant feedback.  That's all.  It started off good.  Why wasn't this guy on John Denver's plane?  Have pity shoot us in the head? 
[02:36:30]  When's the gag coming?  Not everything has to be a gag.  I thought there was some good information there.  It was.  Please play the Hulk music.  Please.  Silent game.  Turn it off, turn it off, one guy writes.  That would have been great.  Punch out, punch out.  We punched out.  Just took a while.  I'm giving myself a stroke.  Could you play some Skinner over this guy? 
[02:37:00]  Wow.  He overpronounces everything just like Steve C.  They didn't like that?  Leonard Skinner.  Both of their engines just shut off.  Dude, I haven't seen this much instant feedback ever.  Jesus Christ, wacky voice alert.  Is this Don West on the phone?  It's cool to see you brought back Bad Guest Day.  Who cares?  Get this douchebag off the air. 
[02:37:30]  Oh God, this guy is so boring.  I want to go down in a fiery plane crash.  Have you ever seen so much instant feedback for a guest?  Look at that.  He was a hit.  Hey, we had a couple effing earlier.  This is the balance that I talk about on this show.  My ears are bleeding.  No, no, no.  If he keeps talking, we would have to read the book.  What a jackass.  That is the truth.  If you're an author, you've got to say something for the reader. 
[02:38:00]  There's not enough methamphetamine in the world to keep you awake when this guy is talking.  Wow.  Wow, just hammered.  We're getting killed.  I think his book would make a good read.  I do too.  Perhaps him, you know, talking about it on the air.  Yeah.  Oh God.  That's what actually happened to the pilot of the Skinner plane.  He was in the cockpit talking to him and he just dozed off and hit the fuel gauge with his forehead.  And I realized that was going to bomb, so I figured the more words I put in, the more likely something funny would be to show up. 
[02:38:30]  Oh my God.  It didn't happen.  Is there any way he can get inside the phone receiver and crash the fucking phone?  People, wow, they have responded.  Yeah, they kind of liked it, I think.  Yeah, I think they enjoyed it.  They enjoyed it.  Frenchie is funnier.  I don't think he was trying to be funny.  All right, there you go.  Yeah.  Your comments right here on the Opie and Anthony show.  This guy sounds like every big voice DJ you guys ever made fun of. 
[02:39:00]  He did have the jock voice.  That's right, everybody.  Playing the hits and popping the zest.  And let me tell you, you will be reading about it in Falling Stars.  Air crashes that filled rock and roll heaven.  All right, well.  No, that was good.  Come on.  I think that was one of our better interviews.  I like the guy.  Yeah.  Apparently our listeners, you got quite a reaction from the listeners.  Isn't that what this show is about, getting reactions?  Of course it is.  Are those the pictures of the couple, by the way? 
[02:39:30]  Oh, I almost forgot they were up here.  Yeah.  How could you?  I had a nice, full, fat rod looking at those.  We had a couple become the sexiest state in America today.  A couple from California, Sacramento.  They did a great job.  If you're just tuning in the show, make sure you listen to the replay today.  Trust me on that one.  But where are these pictures?  Well, oh boy.  I think I just hit a, yeah, I just hit a pop-up mess.  Oh, really?  I just emailed them to you, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, you got them.  Are you going to put some of these up there? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  How many Hummer shots?  I just can't do it from here.  How many Hummer shots?  It looked like one.  There was one Hummer, one reciprocal, and then...  Yeah, I'm looking at the...  Can you see her?  I'm sorry.  I'm looking at the Hummer shot right here.  She's got the phone in her hand.  And...  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Let me just say...  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  He's small.  He's tiny.  He seems to be completely shaved.  Yeah.  He has shaved everything. 
[02:40:30]  But...  It doesn't look...  It looks like she should have been able to carry on a normal conversation on that telephone  with his Johnson in her mouth.  You sure he's shaved and not five?  It's still a hot shot, though.  She's got the phone.  She's talking to us.  She's doing the business.  Her eyes are closed.  Yeah.  Nice shot.  I mean, that's fine.  We'll get that shot up on opianthony.com.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we try to regroup?  We're going to bring the lesbian couch in to make the show more good in a few minutes. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  We need to get on it.  Huh?  We have no one to get on it today.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow we got three girls to break in the lesbian couch.  Tomorrow doesn't work.  That's no good.  Are any of the girls lesbians, though?  Who are they, Steve?  Tomorrow's no good.  You know one of them, actually.  It's a shame you're not going to be here.  Of course he knows one of them.  Who?  God.  The...  What's her name?  Natalia is going to be one of the girls.  Oh.  And she's bringing two friends.  Oh, that's...  Oh, yeah.  New York Confidential Girls.  Oh.  God, do I hate Sacramento.  I'm canceling my shitty shows this weekend.  All right. 
[02:41:30]  Get us out of here, man.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U.  This is Buddha Man from Philly, and I'm sending a big fuck you out to the Republican voters  The narrow-minded, gattitude, hillbilly, redneck, Bible-something-assholes that re-elected George Bush into office  Kiss a Bushin' goodbye, kiss gay rights goodbye, kiss all freedoms goodbye.  Forget about it. 
[02:42:00]  This guy sucks.  He's an asshole.  He should have been gone.  Fuck you, Republican voters.  I just want to say, fuck you, XM Radio, you bunch of fucking wow sticker Jews.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you out to ONA.  Kicking me on hold, it's so fucking wrong.  My cell phone bill is showing you $40, man.  One fucking call, $18.  So ONA, fuck you.  I'd like to send the big F.U. out to the jerk-off that retracted his bid on eBay and made me the high bidder,  which then caused Anthony to call me a dickbag on the air.  Fuck you, jerk-off. 
[02:42:30]  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.  Dude, we got to fucking write something new.  Come on.  I don't like that.  So far, off to a bad start.  Better, closer, warmer.  That's it.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I love you, baby. 
[02:43:00]  But all I can think about is  Kielbasa sausage, your butt cheeks is warm.  A chick, but this chick, you'll need lubrication, honey. 
[02:43:30]  My kielbasa sausage has just got to perform.  Now get it on.  I see you walking, but all I can think about is  Dianetics, your butt cheeks is warm.  I check my dipstick.  You need lubrication, honey. 
[02:44:00]  My kielbasa sausage has just got to perform.  Now I've been set loose.  I'm shooting my juice right in your caboose.  Now fucking get it on.  Now get it on.  Get it on.

Niggas smoking up a big ass boat weed with me.  NKG.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All the ladies in the house say, yeah, yeah.

[02:45:30]  Dude, that was TNT.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Amen. 
[02:46:00]  It's the O&A virus. 
[02:46:30]  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything all the time.  I'm killed.  This guy makes me want to stop pirating my XM radio.  I just drowned myself. 
[02:47:00]  Great.  How come the other half of the audio works today?  He's smart-ass.  He's very funny.  All right.  Well, we'll make good, right?  Oh, probably not.  That's what's so effed up about this radio show.  Was there dead air there?  About an hour ago, we couldn't do no wrong, man.  We had a couple just going at it.  People are praising us, saying we're the best thing ever in radio, and now we're eating it.  All in the same show, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  That happens.  He's nailing everybody in the studio.  All right.  Let's get Erica in here.  She's from Rhode Island, right?  Yeah.  Was she the one that was hungover and couldn't come last week?  Yeah.  Are we on the air?  Yeah.  Because it says, what the F?  What's up with the technical difficulties music coming up?  It happened yesterday at noon.  No, we're on.  Nice dead air, jackass?  Dead air?  Oh, okay.  We're on.  It's on in the Spotify.  I guess there was some dead air.  Yesterday.  No, right now.  We're reading it now.  Dead air, dead air, dead air.  We just missed most of what you said coming in from break. 
[02:48:00]  We heard nothing.  You heard nothing?  Okay.  It's fixed now.  It's fixed now?  Oh, great.  They missed us reading more instant feedback.  We missed all that.  You missed all that?  That was really funny.  We were just getting killed on the instant feedback because of that author of the book  Falling Stars, Anthony.  That's what we were talking about and laughing really hard at.  A couple of people enjoying the dead air more than the author, Opie, on instant feedback.  Why couldn't they have the dead air in the middle of that other segment?  So they didn't hear any of these?  Oh, there were some funny ones, too.  The last five that we did. 
[02:48:30]  They were good ones.  They only heard the last five?  That's interesting.  All right.  Well, it's okay.  Did you guys just hear Jaime?  Yes, I did.  Okay, me too.  Hi, Jaime.  I was being a professional, Jimmy, and just acknowledging that I heard it but not acknowledging it on the  air.  Very good.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know you heard it.  I wanted to make sure.  Did everyone hear in your ear?  It was in the left ear.  I heard Jaime say, is this on?  You're right.  All right.  We're good.  We're good to go.  Major point.  All right.  Major point.  So they didn't hear the instant feedback coming out?  No.  Not that one.  Oh, God.  That was some funny stuff.  They were going still. 
[02:49:00]  They could not hear it on the replay.  All right.  Well, we got Erica in the studio.  Hello.  It's Couch Lady.  Hi.  How are you?  Hello.  So what's the deal?  You were supposed to be here last week with the couch?  Yes, and unfortunately, I had a little, what?  Incident?  Oh.  Infection?  No.  In what?  I don't know.  I guess I had anxiety last week.  Oh, you had an anxiety attack?  I had an anxiety attack.  Is that why our porn stars had to have lesbian sex on a piece of fiberglass? 
[02:49:30]  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  So I was going to wake up really early in the morning and turn around.  But are you the same girl that was just sitting out there?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just wondering.  Because there's other girls that have been walking through.  I guess he was a little confused.  There's another girl sitting next to me that's blonde.  Oh, okay.  I told you there's a bunch of people out there now.  Oh.  I get you.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Erica.  Erica.  So you own a furniture store?  Well, we had an antique consignment shop for furnishings, and we have a bunch of stuff 
[02:50:00]  that we had.  But you were the same girl sitting right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I told you.  Huh.  Are you married?  No.  Oh, nice.  I don't know.  Getting married.  Oh, not nice.  Could you tell us more about the furniture store?  It's closed.  I thought it would make a good addition to the book guy we just listened to.  No, it's...  Why did it close down?  Economy's not good.  No.  And you oversleep a lot?  Pretty much went down the crapper, so...  Yeah.  And I what?  And you oversleep a lot.  I heard you had a problem last week.  I heard you gave me something for anxiety. 
[02:50:30]  Hey, get back on mic.  Knocked me a cold, and I just did not wake up.  Really?  Wait, who gave you this medicine?  My doctor.  Right.  And so you had some anxiety, and he gave you something to make you sleep?  Yeah.  He goes, here, take one of these.  I'm like, good.  What were you anxious about?  I don't...  I...  Well, things and...  Yeah?  Just...  Just things.  Whatever, and I took one and knocked me a cold for like 12 hours straight, and I...  Same girl, huh?  It worked.  You weren't anxious for 12 hours.  Yeah, exactly.  There's something about this glass.  Kind of works, is what I'm thinking.  Oh, the couch is fine. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, here comes the lesbian couch that Erica brought in.  We're having a ceremony.  Do we have any, you know, music that we could play?  We should have thought ahead of time.  Lesbian couch music, Opie.  A little Katie Lang.  What, do you want a polka?  I think there's like a heart filter on that glass or something.  A what?  Like, you know, in the heart videos.  All right, where's the couch?  Very nice.  Jim's on the lesbian couch.  You bet I am.  You want to explain what the lesbian couch is for the people at home? 
[02:51:30]  You're the expert on couches.  It's just a love seat, probably from the 80s.  Yes, it is a love seat.  From the late 80s.  Late 80s?  Probably late 80s.  Only the best for your pals Opie and Anthony.  Early, I don't know exactly what year.  Any stains on it?  No, it's clean.  Where was it all this time?  Yeah, where was it for 20 years?  Come on, tell the truth.  If it doesn't sell in the store after so long, we take ownership of it and it's out in the warehouse for a little while.  It goes to the warehouse for half place.  Oh, we got, if it doesn't sell. 
[02:52:00]  We got the blacklight.  We're going to make sure this is a, well, you need an extension cord, guys.  I don't think it's going to reach.  Sorry, not as good as through the mirror, Opie.  Is that what you're trying to say?  No, I didn't say that, really.  You know what he said?  You can say it.  There was, I don't know, like, you just looked different when you were sitting out there.  That's all.  What are you saying?  She's lovely.  I know she's lovely.  Stop trying to cause trouble.  Norton's causing trouble.  I'm not at all.  I'm trying to sit on the couch and look at her hiney.  You have a nice hiney.  Oh.  She goes, oh. 
[02:52:30]  Do you have an extension cord?  Are we going to check it with the blacklight?  Yeah, we're going to check it with the blacklight.  All right, we're plugging in the blacklight.  I want to see if anybody's been having any hanky-panky.  No idea who owned it prior to, I have no idea.  Oh, you have no idea.  Homicide committed on this couch.  All right.  You could only dream.  Turn off the lights.  Ooh.  This will definitely make this more gooder.  Oh, God.  It's light out.  We have to get some curtains, by the way, for them stupid people.  We don't have the blacklight.  Matt, it's curtains for you.  I asked you guys what you wanted.  I could have brought curtains.  No, the couch is fine. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, the couch is fine.  A post-1981 couch?  I have no idea what year it's from.  It does look kind of 80.  All right, let's turn on the blacklight.  Here we go.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's kind of, you know, you're not going to...  It's fine.  It'll serve the purpose.  Yeah, for a bunch of dykes.  Don't blacklight the girl.  Blacklight the couch.  Oh, boy.  Can you turn it on?  What are you doing?  Why doesn't anything work on this show, ever?  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny, get that blacklight.  Networking, that's the important thing. 
[02:53:30]  All right, now we're trying to figure out how to turn on the blacklight.  Come over here.  I'll fill out your card.  While this show is just going downhill in a hurry.  No.  We can't figure out the blacklight.  It's fine.  Danny, what's wrong with the blacklight?  I don't know.  It's not turning on.  Danny.  Danny.  Sorry.  Calm down.  Danny.  It'll be okay.  I tested it before I brought it in to make sure that it worked before I brought it here.  For some reason, it's bad.  It's been laying in the booth.  Plug it directly into the wall and see if it works.  That's the socket is bad.  There you go.  There's plenty of things that...  All right.  We got the blacklight on. 
[02:54:00]  It's the extension cord.  It's the extension cord.  Everyone calm down.  All right.  Pull the couch over and give it a once over.  How do you know if there's a load on there?  What do you see?  You'll see white.  Oh, my God.  Is that X-Files music?  Very good.  All right.  We're checking the lesbian couch for splooge marks.  So far, so good, right?  Anything?  We're getting a thumbs up.  Oh, oh, oh.  They're pointing out something.  Steve?  Eric?  Jim?  Yeah.  And on the armrest would be where you would bend a girl over and bang her.  All right.  See, absolutely.  What are you seeing?  Big white stain right on me.  Get out of here.  Let me see.  Armrest.  I'm not lying.  Take a look. 
[02:54:30]  Uh-oh.  What does it look like, Mulder?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You would absolutely use that part of the couch, too.  You would bend her over that.  That's a definite load right there.  A dried-up load.  That light detects semen.  Oh, there's another one.  There's something going on over there where your upper back would rest on the back of the  couch there, Anthony.  All right.  What is that?  Is that urine?  Oh, that's just the design.  No, what is that?  Is that the pattern of the couch? 
[02:55:00]  It is now.  All right.  That's what...  I don't know, man.  Is that the pattern of the couch, or is this just splattered?  Sploge stain.  Sploge.  Oh, what about that stain?  That's the pattern.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  I see the pattern.  The pattern is called jizz stain.  It was very popular in the early 80s.  Oh, there's another one.  Oh, is that a big stain right there?  What do you think?  Wait a minute.  Maybe that's just the pattern, too.  I think we have a relatively clean lesbian couch, Anthony. 
[02:55:30]  I think so, too.  There's one or two spots on it, but...  Well, I don't know.  Let's go back to the stain on the right armrest.  There's leaves in it?  There's leaves in the couch, Anthony.  Yes.  I aired it out yesterday.  What?  What?  I aired it out yesterday on the leaves.  Outside and leaves fell?  Yes.  All right.  She aired it out.  Thanks.  Uh, wow.  Look at that.  A condom.  No.  Ugh.  All right.  I think we're pretty clean, huh?  Clean.  Look, a thousand young couches.  Let's go back to this stain over here.  I think this might be just part of the patent. 
[02:56:00]  No, that's a stain.  Okay.  Yeah, that's a stain.  We definitely have one stain in it.  All right.  Well, hopefully tomorrow we'll get a bunch more stains on that thing.  Okay.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You won't be here.  Ugh.  That was nice.  I like that.  The lights were out.  The X-Files music playing.  Yeah, I like the lights out.  The weird black light on like they're investigating something.  Very nice.  That was good.  Well, guys, the show became more gooder today.  We now have our lesbian couch back.  Yeah.  I'm glad there's no lesbians here to use it.  I know.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow we're going to do it.  Maybe they can't make it tomorrow.  The Dykes will come out tomorrow. 
[02:56:30]  Tomorrow.  All right.  Well, I hope you appreciate it.  Very much.  And use it often.  So when are you getting married?  I was supposed to get married this month.  But what happened?  Why?  Why?  Uh-oh.  Because of the store closing and other stuff.  So we decided to push it off to the summer.  What was the other stuff?  Did he bring it up to you?  Oh, no.  It had nothing to do with Ben.  No?  He didn't bring it up to you and say,  Perhaps, you know, the store closing, we should push this off? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, guys tend to really want to postpone those things.  Who's Ben?  So be it.  My fiance.  Oh, I'm thinking of Ben Sparks here.  Don't say.  Our own producer.  So maybe he whipped out that big, delicious treat.  It's not a big deal.  No?  No.  It's one of those take it or leave it, married and not married things?  Well, whatever.  It will happen.  Isn't it kind of an important thing, though?  It is.  You should be kind of excited about that, no?  You know, yeah, you are.  But, you know, you can't dwell on it.  If it happens, you know, you've got to post it.  If it happens, it happens.  If it happens, you know.  There's a story here. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  What's the story?  Come on.  How long have you dated Ben?  I have been dating Ben for a little over three years.  Okay.  Cool.  His mom owns the store, you know.  Uh-uh.  The mom doesn't like you.  Oh, no.  No?  She's in New York.  Oh.  She's cool.  It's just that the economy went down the shitter.  No, it didn't.  People don't want to buy stuff that's used.  Listen to Bush, it didn't.  It's got leaves on it, yeah.  Yeah, they want to buy new stuff and not pay two years in no interest, you know? 
[02:58:00]  So they don't want to go spend money.  Oh, it was used furniture.  Because it's a consignment shop.  Exactly.  It's all used stuff.  Oh, okay.  People kind of want new furniture.  Yeah, they want their furniture without sploosh.  They want to go to the big furniture places.  Right.  They want clean furniture.  They want to shop at Siemens, not have furniture with semen on it.  Exactly.  Right.  God forbid they want clean stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have sales on Tuesday?  Starting at noon.  We're selling the best used furniture with the biggest sploosh stains. 
[02:58:30]  This Tuesday night, come in for our sploosh stain spectacular at sploosh stains.  No, of course it's not named sploosh stains.  Your store wasn't named sploosh stains, was it?  No.  And I'm not going to say the name of the store.  Okay.  So now things with Ben, you kind of, you want to get married, but.  Oh yeah, we're totally going to get married.  We're now changing the entire concept of the wedding.  We were going to do that typical, you know, big reception and everyone sits down for a  dinner and the photographer and the limo, you know, that whole. 
[02:59:00]  You're going to tame it down?  The whole wedding.  Now it's going to be.  Just get a tent in the backyard.  No, that's what we're doing, we're going, money was an issue, I'm not going to lie.  Okay.  Money was a total issue.  So.  Well, it sounds like it.  Just a tent with a bunch of load-stained couches.  Yeah.  Instead of spending 30 grand, we're going to cut it back probably to 10.  Fine.  So, we'll just have a big fat party this summer and.  All right.  Sort of sounds like you're going through a tough time.  No, I mean, not necessarily.  No? 
[02:59:30]  I'm getting through it.  I'm fine.  Well, it sounds like the anxiety and the furniture store closing and the marriage having to be  postponed and scaled back.  I'm a mess.  Fine.  Yeah.  I admit it.  It does sound like, you know, it's a little bit of stress in your life.  And I'm glad you could take time out from your stressful life and bring us a lesbian couch.  Oh, I had all the time in the world.  There are other ways to earn money.  Jimmy will show you.  At the nasty hotel I stayed at last night next door.  Oh, did you stay in the city?  I stayed next door at.  How do you get the couch here?  In your car? 
[03:00:00]  In a minivan.  In a minivan.  Which hotel did you stay at?  The one to the.  Is it the one Opa used to stay at?  Similar.  Oh, yeah?  What's it called?  I don't know.  You tell us.  The one right here to the right of the building.  Oh, the other.  I didn't even know there was a hotel there.  The Salisbury Hotel.  That's that awful?  Isn't that a homeless hotel?  I walked in and gone, ooh.  I think that's a flop house.  It's like a flop house or something.  I thought it was classy.  I don't know.  So not.  Lit Park of Meridian is right across the street.  And then we walked in.  And that's a wonderful hotel.  I love it.  Why didn't you stay at the old Park of Meridian? 
[03:00:30]  I didn't even know it was there.  Because business is bad.  No, not necessarily.  I don't really care.  Couldn't afford it, Jim, okay?  Thanks for rubbing it in.  I wouldn't stay there.  For four hours?  I mean, I got to bed at midnight.  She can't afford her wedding, and you spend $30,000 a year on hookers.  Why'd you get up in the morning?  Why'd you?  I didn't know what time necessarily you guys could take it in, so I just decided to come.  We were trying to sleep after the anxiety medication and thinking about the business going down and sleeping in the hotel with the red neon light blinking through the window. 
[03:01:00]  Actually, no, I fell right to sleep, and then I got up and showered and came over here.  Really?  See you guys.  Wasn't that big a deal?  No.  I'm sorry.  I got nothing.  I'm a mess.  Trying to sleep, and this is outside.  What?  What?  I just want to drop the couch off.  No, I'm glad I brought it to you guys.  No, you kidding?  No, we're happy.  You kidding me?  Oh, no, I'm glad.  That's better than the last one we had.  It was a little road trip for me to take, you know? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, no, awesome.  We'll give you some prizes.  Yeah.  I actually have prizes for you guys.  What do you have?  What do you have?  I brought some other stuff for you.  What?  What gifts?  Would you like me to get it?  Sure would.  Yeah.  No, not donkey sausage kind of thing.  No, no, no.  No, follow Ben out the door and get the other stuff.  What kind of gifts?  I don't know.  It's just a little stuff.  All right, yeah, go get the gifts.  Yeah.  I'd like a gift.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Opie, it's on outside. 
[03:02:00]  Oh.  I don't know.  I want an audio.  Audio's on outside.  She's coming back in with her gifts.  All right.  Shut up, Ben.  Jesus.  Ben's giggling like a nut out there.  Bring her in.  Bring her in.  Oh, I didn't know what you were doing.  Bring the lady in with the gifts.  Jesus.  Bring in the present lady.  I'll hear the replay.  Talk anything you want to tell me.  I really don't care.  That's what sucks about this show.  Don't.  Stupid replay.  Stupid replay.  Doesn't offend me.  No.  All right.  We like you, actually.  Yeah.  What kind of gifts? 
[03:02:30]  What do we got?  It's a magazine.  A sink magazine that we're in.  A buying gift.  That we have.  Huh?  You want us to sign it.  The sink.  You want us to sign stuff?  That's a gift.  And what's with the pink hat?  Pink hat?  Is that a gift?  Is that yours?  Steve, we got a gift.  No, like I said, the store's closed and, you know, I listen all the time.  So, you know, I heard a couple different things.  Oh, boy.  I went to the store and grabbed some stuff just for.  All righty.  All right.  Let's see what she's got for everybody.  Well, I have.  Buckle in. 
[03:03:00]  He has nothing to entertain with.  I grabbed something.  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's not bad.  What is it?  Is it one of those things that's used for jacking off, like, in 10 to midnight?  No, it's just a simple little dish that he can just throw on the table.  Oh, and, like, chips can go in there?  Oh, wow.  This is like a housewarming.  Hey, you haven't got a housewarming gift yet, have you?  So, you gave Opie something that is breakable.  I really, you know, it's just grab some stuff.  We all get our gifts.  Why would you give Opie something that he could perhaps accidentally drop? 
[03:03:30]  You could have washed it before he gave it to me.  Jesus.  There's leftover dip in the dip part.  Check the price tag on the back.  Oh, she spent $13.50 on me.  Thank you.  And then I got two beer pitchers for you guys in case.  Oh, we might need pitchers.  That's true.  Hey, I just grabbed some stuff.  Don't worry.  I don't understand.  Don't be defensive.  You're bringing us gifts, and we appreciate them.  I'm going to smash this.  No. 
[03:04:00]  He is the worst.  What?  You are the worst.  Now, that's a nice pitcher.  It is a nice pitcher.  Is it glass?  No, it's that hard plastic, right?  It's plastic.  Those are good to drink a lot of beer out of if you're starring in Young Frankenstein.  I thought it was glass.  All right, what's that?  What do you got over there?  Looks like a Claymore mine.  What is that?  Oh, I think it's...  Poker chips?  Poker chips?  From the 1940s.  It's poker chips that Al Capone used. 
[03:04:30]  You obviously stopped at a garage sale on the way down to the aisle.  It looks like poker chips in a hat box.  Oh, they're in.  In a hat box.  Wow.  Wow.  I got some...  I don't know.  You got any cards with those chips?  Yes.  Oh, let's have a little hand just for fun.  I could sit here now and shuffle chips with one hand.  Wow.  Like they do on the World Series of Poker.  That's just wonderful.  This is good.  I'll bet there's a gift for Jim Norton in there. 
[03:05:00]  This probably sat on top of a 60s-style folding poker table for years.  I hate my gift.  What is that?  I'm fear it's a joke because they were ranking on you.  You had nothing.  What is...  What's that?  My gift stinks.  Oh, wow.  Oh, they're playing cards from the Moshe Suck Valley Railroad Company.  What the fuck is this?  Wow.  I guess there must be some more gifts in there. 
[03:05:30]  Now that's it.  No?  Wait, you got a beer pitcher for Jim?  I just grabbed him for all of you to use.  But what about Jim?  It's for everybody.  But that's not fair.  No, these are for everybody.  It's not necessarily...  I mean...  But I don't drink alcohol.  Exactly.  Could someone open the window?  Yeah, I'll take it back.  All right.  Name of the game is Texas Hold'em, boys.  Ooh, you got chips and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be great if they weren't...  That pack wasn't missing aces. 
[03:06:00]  Card with little...  Are there 52 in there?  I don't think there's 52 cards there.  Oh, this is...  Should have never brought these in as a donkey sausage.  At least the other pack of cards is still wrapped.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got one wrapped, one unwrapped.  Would you gamble at the bus station on the way here?  Yes, I did.  And then this pack, because there's four decks of cards, both of these are still wrapped.  Atta boy.  I'd love to know where these came from.  No idea.  Where'd you get them?  The store.  What store?  Her store. 
[03:06:30]  Someone probably bought them in.  I can't imagine why the store is going under.  I just can't fathom.  With little tidbits like this?  Little trinkets and knickknacks?  Yeah, you might need better stuff in your store.  Maybe that's what it is.  Wow.  You were selling this?  There's plenty of stuff in there that was very nice.  I bet.  Only the best for your pals, huh?  You can throw it out the window.  Stop looking around.  I know him.  You break it.  I'd be happy if you broke it. 
[03:07:00]  I'm just trying to figure out where I could break it.  This place is so nice and new.  No, no.  This state-of-the-art studio that we're in.  It's a bit.  Opie doesn't really break things.  The gang from XM Satellite built for us.  Opie doesn't really break things.  It's a joke.  I never broke a thing in my life.  It's a bit.  Oh, the cars have little trains on them.  Yeah, little choo-chos.  Choo-choo!  Well, if you haven't broken anything yet, you might as well, because it could be the first  thing you break in the studio.  You broke your mouth, but that could be the second thing.  That's a good gift.  You could have people over.  You could put the dip in the one thing and the chips in the surrounding dish. 
[03:07:30]  Well, Martha Stewart, this is a very good suggestion.  All right.  Well, this is lovely.  Thank you.  I'm done.  There's your couch.  All right.  Thank you for the couch and the gifts and everything.  You're welcome.  Why do you look so dejected?  Yeah.  I'm very happy.  I play cards, and now I have chips and choo-choo train cards.  Two packs of cards and a felt case.  Yeah, the case is felt with some gold leaf trim on the side. 
[03:08:00]  That's right.  It's like an old velour shirt I had when I was eight.  Can I see those pictures?  Yeah.  I promise you're not going to break it.  Don't break anything, Opie.  No, I need the other one, too.  That's not bad.  Oh, I can't break this.  No, why would you?  It's glass.  It is glass, right?  It's glass.  They're both real glass?  Yeah, people will.  It's plastic.  I was ready to shower to that.  No, I wasn't.  I'm kidding.  No.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Enjoy.  We got the lesbian couch, which we will use tomorrow. 
[03:08:30]  Opie got a nice gift, and Anthony got a nice gift, and I don't drink, but I have beer  pictures that I can share with the group.  You can put some soda pop in it.  You don't listen to the New York Times, do you?  Oh.  You can put some soda pop in it.  Maybe I can have a Coke.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, you're welcome, guys.  Okay.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  We have to take our picture, don't we?  Well, we're done.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, don't, don't, don't. 
[03:09:00]  You're going to go right through that window.  It's going to go through the control room window.  No, Opie, oh my God, no.  Opie, don't.  Don't do it.  She's still in there.  Oh my God.  No.  See, you put dip in that, and then you put the chips in the around there.  It's not even washed out.  It's nice.  And you can, look at the remnants from the dip.  It was a going away party.  Great party, isn't it? 
[03:09:30]  When you have your little party on Sunday for football?  Yeah.  Why is this place so nice?  There's nothing to break in it.  Nah, you know, don't drop it on the floor.  Opie, Opie, Opie.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  He just gave Jaime a heart attack.  Oh my God.  Oh, Opie.  Oh my God.  You threw it.  Oh my God.  It's broken all over.  Yeah, you got the little, now you just separated. 
[03:10:00]  You can put the dip in that dish.  All right, I'm not even looking out the window.  I can't even look at her face now.  Why?  Because she gave you something and you fucking broke it.  I didn't, I didn't think it would break that easily.  It's ceramic.  It's rare when you throw ceramic on a hard floor that it breaks.  I could see where you'd be confused.  Oh my God.  You are the worst human.  She's ready for her picture with you, Opie.  I can't even look outside.  No.  Why?  Oh God. 
[03:10:30]  Not even smiling at all.  I can't believe you.  I cannot believe you.  You can fix that.  A little glue.  Opie, look out the window.  I can't.  Look out the window.  She's going to cry.  I'm sorry.  Is she smiling?  You can put this right back together.  This is not even that much damage.  You know?  All right, well.  Oof.  All right, well.  Let's, uh, let's get out of this uncomfortable situation, please. 
[03:11:00]  She's really hurt.  She is.  I snorted cocaine for about 15 years, my dumb ass.  I must have snorted up Peru. 
[03:11:30]  I could have bought Peru all the shit I snorted.  Could have just gave him the money up front and had me a piece of property.  I started off snorting little tiny pinches.  Said, I know I ain't going to get hooked.  I don't know coke.  You can't get hooked.  My friends have been snorting 15 years.  They ain't hooked.  I started off snorting little tiny.  Didn't even make noise.  Coke etiquette, Jack. 
[03:12:00]  Pass the album, please.  No more for me.  Six months later.  Licking the album shit.  Trying to get a freeze.  Somebody told me, you put it on your dick, you could fuck all night.  Shouldn't have told me that.  My dick had a Jones. 
[03:12:30]  Six hundred dollars a day just to get my dick hard.  And you get weird sexual fantasies too when you be on coke.  Just think of some weird...  Baby, I got a great idea.  I want you to go out on the roof.  I'm going to run around the house three times.  On the third time, I want you to jump off on my face.  Got a witness. 
[03:13:00]  Them niggas pointing at each other.  Niggas will not admit to giving up no head.  Really.  Not that.  Uh-uh, no.  Nah.  Not the kid.  Uh-uh, no.  Nah. 
[03:13:30]  Nah, I ain't no termite.  Be lying their ass off.  And black women like head, but they won't kiss you afterwards.  Right?  No, no.  No, it's bad for your teeth.  It's better to give than receive.  And dudes be trying to talk a lot of shit on cocaine too, right? 
[03:14:00]  Be thinking they making plenty of sense.  Don't be saying shit.  I be saying shit.  I nix some shit.  That's my shit.  God damn.  And the pimps get psychotic when they get hijacked.  Them motherfuckers get all the moves together.  Shit, I'm not.  I got a little girl.  You know what I mean?  I'm not.  Nah, the men scream on me.  I'm not.  You know?  I got five.  You know?  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm only.  I'm only.  See?  No.  No.  No.  It's a bitch.  You know what I mean? 
[03:14:30]  I'm going to hold a mess.  I ain't holding a motherfucking thing.  You know?  You know?  I'm going to do it.  Huh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know?  You know?  You know?  Huh?  Yeah.  I'm ready for Freddy.  You know what I mean?  Now, niggas be holding them dicks too, Jack.  White people go, why do you guys hold your things?  So you done took everything else, motherfucker.  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  You know?  Niggas be checking. 
[03:15:00]  You can't tell nobody not to snort, no coke.  Because motherfuckers are going to snort anyway.  It took me a long time to learn.  That shit will kill you.  Man, when the big booger came out of my nose, scared the shit out of me.  That motherfucking black one this long, I said, God damn.  Lord, please, don't quit.  Please.  Just let it stop.  Opie Anthony dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[03:15:30]  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Norton was just lying on the lesbian couch.  It stinks, huh?  It's fine.  It smells moldy.  I'm just tired.  I don't care.  All right.  Well, I like the lesbian couch.  Thumbs up to the lesbian couch.  It'll smell like...  It has only one splooge stain, so that's good.  That'll change up. 
[03:16:00]  Were you trying to give her a thumbs up through the window?  How revolting was that?  Thumbs up.  I'm with you.  She's just staring into space.  She's not even looking at you.  She's not trying to make up for smashing her gift.  I just kind of tossed it to the side, and then it's shattered.  I don't know.  It's ceramic, and you broke it on purpose, and you giggled.  You're an awful person.  All right, well...  Your aunt's doing nothing but trashing those awful 1951 poker chips.  Yeah, see, that's the difference, though, man.  Why don't you say what you were saying during the commercial break, how much I hate your  poker chips.  I said...  And wish I had balls like me. 
[03:16:30]  That these days...  Those chips stink.  Nowadays, you can get chips that are the same chips you play with in Vegas.  You know who uses chips like that?  Third graders.  Yeah, these chips are...  They need a little weight.  They don't have any weight for them.  Right, they need some weight.  These are the plastic chips you used to play with with, like, your junior high buddies.  They're awful.  You'd steal them from your parents and play poker.  They are awful plastic chips.  Give her the chips back.  Yeah, you got it.  Why should I give them back?  Just tell her you don't want them. 
[03:17:00]  You might have to, Ant.  Oh, Brady's a good point.  Tell her you don't want her stupid chips.  Why do I have to be part of your rudeness?  Because you're, like, all brave when we're in commercial break.  But I can understand, you know, that something might suck and I might hate it, but I'm not  going to...  And, Norton, what about you?  These gifts stink.  They do stink.  I don't want to be known as the bad guy today.  The Lucille Ball hat box she bought when she was out with Viv.  She got that from a garage sale.  That little stupid hat in the box. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Take it back, Lucy.  Now, Anthony.  That's what it looks like.  Call her back in here.  But I understand I can get a bad gift and still be nice and not hurt people's feelings.  Call her back in here and give her her gift back.  Why do I have to hurt someone's feelings?  I will not bow to peer pressure and hurt someone's feelings.  Call her out on her gift.  I will tell her her gift sucks, but I will keep it.  Oh, you will, huh?  Yeah.  Let's see Anthony say that.  You're really not coming back in here.  Are you insane?  Hi, Erica.  I just wanted to say, Opie had a little mishandling of your gift. 
[03:18:00]  He bobbled it a little while he was trying to put it over by his stuff, and it broke.  But I have the cards and chips, and thank you.  You guys, I know.  I know.  Anthony, tell her.  Throw them out.  You hate them.  I don't care.  What?  No.  Don't bother me.  What?  Are those good chips?  I'm not saying that they're bad chips.  Are they good chips?  No, they're old.  They're probably from the 70s.  I just grabbed them.  70s Earth Mama chips.  70s Earth Mama muff chips. 
[03:18:30]  Throw them away.  It would have been cool if it came from Frank Sinatra's house, but obviously it didn't.  You know, they could be worth money.  You don't know.  I don't know.  If they were worth money, you'd be getting married.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah, that's a genuine wood chip holder, isn't it?  Hey, give me those chips.  Get that away from my face, Steve.  Steve, give her or her chips.  Give Opie the chips.  Look, I'm just thinking I like them.  I really do.  But I'm thinking maybe somebody else could use them more than I could. 
[03:19:00]  I'd be more than happy to take them and throw them in the trash for you, Anthony.  I'm not going to throw them in the trash, but perhaps somebody could use them more than I could.  Tell her.  I'll take them back, Anthony.  Just give them to me.  Tell her.  She's yelling.  Tell her.  I'm trying to be nice.  What do you mean someone else?  Why am I being yelled at?  You play Texas Hold'em.  Why can't you use those?  Well, they're just not quite the type of equipment I like playing with.  What kind do you like playing with?  They're chips and cards.  Well, different cards and different chips.  People play with different types of things.  Yes, sir.  I'll pass it back to her.  Just give her the chips. 
[03:19:30]  Opie, give those to her.  It's heavy.  Here, these are the cards that are still.  There you go.  They're all wrapped up.  See, they're still wrapped.  They're all wrapped up.  You ever play 52 card pick-up?  Throw them on my knock on my neck.  Oh, gee.  Opie.  There's no reason I eat the cards at her.  Did the cards hit you?  Did they?  Opie, she had cards fall off her sleeve.  Come on.  No.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, my God. 
[03:20:00]  Opie.  Holy shit.  Opie.  Don't videotape.  Oh, boy.  Now, clean it up.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  I am mortified.  Oh, Eric, she spilled my chips. 
[03:20:30]  I'm not mortified.  I knew you'd do stuff like this.  You're a thing.  She spilled my chips.  You're guinea brat, now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  Oh, my God.  I'm mortified.  I apologize for the other half of this program. 
[03:21:00]  Don't apologize.  Don't apologize.  I don't really care.  That is uncalled for.  That was uncalled for.  I hope you got a good laugh.  I hope you got a good laugh.  God, he's still immersed in it.  It's fine.  He can laugh all the time.  I can't even talk to you.  That is horrible, man.  I knew from the start it was a bad idea to bring those in in the first place. 
[03:21:30]  I should have just brought the couch and be done with it.  That is horrible.  Look, I didn't have a problem with him or anything.  I hope for some reason, I don't understand why he's got to be like that.  Oh, my God.  It hurts.  I apologize for the actions of some of the people on this program.  You know.  I will enjoy picking up your poker chips. 
[03:22:00]  Um, thank you.  You guys can finish your show and talk about me and do whatever you want.  I don't care.  All right.  There she goes.  Hi, guys.  Wait, wait.  She's walking away.  Wait, can you take these?  Oh, look.  She's getting her.  She's not even going to sit back down.  She's getting her stuff.  Oh, my God.  There she goes.  Ben, go smooth things over. 
[03:22:30]  Ben, smooth things over a little bit.  Remember when Rick had to smooth things over?  Guess what?  Now it's your fucking job.  If you wanted to be the big dog, go ahead.  There it is.  Yeah, you're the big producer now.  Go fix that.  That is the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  We broke it.  You fix it.  Because the way you threw them and rolled them across the console, it was a heavy stud and  they rolled and all just fell off.  And the chips were flying out and the chip carrier fell on her foot.  It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen one person do to another. 
[03:23:00]  That's the biggest laugh I've had on the show.  I couldn't breathe.  You are an awful person.  I literally could not breathe.  I was laughing so hard.  I don't know how you do that.  That just makes me so happy.  Those are things you think about doing sometimes, but no human does them.  But Opie, just stay.  I'll break your bowl.  I'll throw the chips at you.  I'll fling the cards at your face.  These chips have coffee stains on them.  These are awful.  See, now you're brave.  I can't be brave with you.  Holy S.  The back of my skull hurts.  I laugh so hard. 
[03:23:30]  Eric from Jersey.  The sound of plastic chips raining to the floor is the saddest sound I've ever heard.  It will be like the sound of the thousands of tears she's going to shed in the car.  Yeah.  Just walked outside with Ben.  Ben's talking to her right now.  Yeah.  Gave her a nice garbage bag full of Opie stuff.  She is bawling.  Oh my God.  See, I knew it.  Here's what she said.  She goes, I don't mind if he broke it, but he threw it at me.  Oh no. 
[03:24:00]  And she turned her face into the wall near the elevator and that's all you're hearing.  Stop it.  You are horrible.  Grinch radio is back, boys and girls.  It's about effing time.  She threw the chips.  I didn't throw him at her.  Hold on, man.  Are things being smoothed over them?  He actually didn't throw him at her.  I'm going to go check now.  I was a very good athlete when I was growing up and trust me, I didn't throw him at her.  Go fix that.  I made it very close.  Go fix that. 
[03:24:30]  Oh my God.  Oh, that's awful.  I cannot believe that.  I'm horrified.  All right.  Opie has no soul.  Evil to the core.  Yeah.  That's what they're writing.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  Opie is the effing antichrist.  And I wonder why I'm alone.  I go home alone every day and I wonder why.  Why am I alone?  Jesus. 
[03:25:00]  Can't figure that one out.  You made her cry.  I didn't want her to cry.  She was nice and she tried to be good natured about it.  I know.  She tried to take the ribbing.  It was the loud chips falling before the thing rolled off the console.  That was a big bet.  I'm all in.  I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please.  Dude, you've got to read something to get some feedback.  This guy, Cody from Buffalo. 
[03:25:30]  Opie put some good force into throwing those chips.  Sounds like some South American ring stick.  No, that's...  I was horrified during that whole thing.  An update?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ben's calming her down.  Steve's out there.  They're getting her to breathe and calm down.  And they're going to try to see if she wants to come back in and get her picture.  Yeah, because she wanted pictures and stuff.  Tell her if she cleans up. 
[03:26:00]  Say you're brave without her in the studio.  That's the difference.  I admit it.  That's the difference between you and I.  Say that to her face.  No, I've done enough.  Haven't you done enough?  I think I've done enough.  I can't...  I don't know even...  What's going on out there?  It's just...  It's not fun, Ope.  He threw it right at her.  I didn't throw it right at her.  Do we have the videotape?  You didn't get that on videotape?  Yeah, I did.  You got that on videotape? 
[03:26:30]  It kind of rolled on the console.  I kind of just rolled it at her.  Okay, well...  She had plenty of time to get out of the way.  Oh, jeez.  A little upset.  Yeah, I would guess.  A little drove all the way here from Rhode Island.  Just to give something to the show?  Yeah.  Want to get her photo?  Oh, my God.  She comes here to give something to the show and get a picture with Opie and Anthony.  Maybe she should have gave something to us from this decade.  Who are you to say that our gifts aren't good enough?  You know what?  He was frankincense and myrrh not a good enough gift, Opie. 
[03:27:00]  We're starting a rule on this show.  You bring gifts.  Don't get them from a garage sale.  That's all we ask.  You know, Baby Jesus' best gift he got was a song from a little drummer boy, Opie.  That's right.  Opie.  It had nothing to do with materialism.  It had nothing to do with the gold, frankincense, and myrrh might have been good gifts.  But the little drummer boy's song was the best gift of all.  And I'd have taken that over those lousy chips.  All right.  Well, let me see the video, Anthony. 
[03:27:30]  All right.  Here's the video.  We're looking back at the tape.  She's all smiley.  Steve, I'll need a screening when you're done there.  Oh, my God.  Well, you kind of missed the toss, but you got the aftermath.  I wasn't really expecting you to do that.  Oh, gee.  What did you think you were going to do?  Play a hand?  It's like catching a UFO.  You're just not expecting it.  Wow.  That's...  Well, look at Norton.  This is going to be great for foundrymusic.com.  I'm all in.  Show Anthony.  All right.  Bring that over here.  I got to see that.  I think the audio will really help that clip because you were too close on her face. 
[03:28:00]  But all you see is the chips go flying by her.  All right, well.  All right.  Let me get a look.  All right.  There's Opie with the devious smile on his face.  She's talking.  Still, yes.  Smiling.  Oh, my God.  No, that's...  Well, you see it clearly.  You see the chips flying by on the table.  Yes, Ben.  Not as if we've done enough damage to being in this new building already.  There's people just coming to work, getting off the elevator. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  You see this all going on in the hallway and are just mortified.  Oh, they see her crying out front.  Him filming it.  See that?  Yeah.  Not even trying to comfort her.  Could you face this way when you break down emotionally?  Holy...  I'm horrified.  I am horrified.  Yeah, I'm not going to fix this one.  See, this is the type of thing, the barrier that people say, you know, how far do you take 
[03:29:00]  things on satellite radio?  That's where, you know, I think the line should have been drawn somewhere.  Yeah.  Girl's just trying to bring some gifts to the show.  I definitely...  Give me those, I'll pass them to her.  She enjoys...  What?  What?  Give me those, I'll pass them to her.  You're horrible, man.  That clip is hilarious.  You see her face, and then in the background, you see the chips just flying by on the table.  Look at the construction workers looking at it like, what the hell's going on in there?  All right, well...  Awful.  Can we take our last break and then regroup here, I guess? 
[03:29:30]  I think, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That was great.  I, uh...  Why don't you go out and take your picture with her, Oof?  Yeah.  Old fan from the AF days?  She's been a fan since the AF days.  Whatever.  The first time in ten years she's going to meet us.  Go buy Demented World and shut up.  No, she's, uh...  She's a nice lady.  I'm just waiting for them to hit the commercials because I'm really uncomfortable still.  Go.  Go. 
[03:30:00]  Shut your mouth.  I said shut your fucking mouth.  I masturbated so hard, I almost broke my vagina.  We went to the movies.  We go once in a while now.  But guys, once you get married...  Single guys, listen.  Listen, you're fucked.  Once you get married, you don't pick any movie ever again. 
[03:30:30]  My turn to pick out the movie.  You picked it out last time.  I fucking have never picked one out ever.  Once you get the ring on your finger, it's like Les Miserables and Shakespeare did something  to his ass and...  Satanic and fucking...  Julia Rom and Aaron Brock and Vince...  Notting Hill...  Bride of the Bride of the fucking Runaway Bride.  This does not mean Schwarzenegger blows anything up ever again. 
[03:31:00]  Thank you.  They drag us in.  The only reason the guys go is for the snacks and shit.  We went to go see this one.  Message in a bottle.  You ever see this one?  Listen to the ladies.  Yes.  Oh my God.  Yes.  Yankee Candle.  Yes.  Here's the story.  Kevin Costner is on a 90-foot sailboat with a beautiful blonde swinging on a fucking hammock  drinking a bottle of red wine and my wife is watching this shit. 
[03:31:30]  She's like...  I got a raisinette stuck in my back.  Mola.  What?  You're such an asshole.  Why?  You're not even paying attention. 
[03:32:00]  He's got a fucking ball...  Whatever.  Why can't we ever do that?  Let me think for just a second.  Oh my God.  I just fucking remembered.  We don't have a 90-foot sailboat.  I don't look anything like Kevin Costner.  And unfortunately, you don't look like that fucking blonde he's toting around with her.  I ain't got enough money to buy a hammock, for Christ's sake. 
[03:32:30]  But if you want, I'll buy you a bottle of Boone's Farm.  And we can sit on the back porch and talk about it.  But I'm pretty sure it ain't gonna have the same ending.

[03:33:30]  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  This is the best show ever.  The OVM show.  Norton's still laughing.  Spider-bait.  It's the O&A show.  The O&A virus spreading across America on XM satellite radio.  Thanks for checking us out.  All right.  Jimmy, did you cut one?  No, I really didn't.  That's the couch. 
[03:34:00]  It better not be.  It really is the couch.  That thing really stinks.  Do you hear Jaime?  I don't hear him.  I don't hear you when I'm in this other jack.  I don't hear him.  I don't hear that either, Jaime.  All right.  We'll worry about that later.  I heard you, Jaime.  He's talking to me.  You can talk to individual people with that, Opie, so they could make jokes about us.  We wouldn't even know.  I know.  I just heard that, Jaime.  I wonder what they're saying about me.  You can only imagine.  Let's say hi to Brian in Long Island.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, Brian. 
[03:34:30]  That was the goddamn funniest thing I've ever heard.  Oh.  The sound of those chips hitting the floor.  Oh, God.  You could just...  I could just see that poor woman's face.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I hope the video captures the fact that we were laughing so hard, but we're so embarrassed  at the same time, and we were all trying to look anywhere but at her.  Oh, God.  Just other drivers are looking at me like I was totally out of my mind.  I almost freaking crashed, man.  I'm driving to Valley Stream.  Poor woman.  I almost went right into the water.  All right.  That's not right.  That's the biggest laugh I've had on the show. 
[03:35:00]  That was the biggest laugh I've had.  Bigger laughs, I think.  That made me laugh the hardest.  I haven't seen you laugh that hard in a while.  Paul from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, I'm just curious.  Did you go on break so you could run over to the window and drop the couch on her head?  Honestly, I was trying to figure out how to open the window, but they're still pretty good.  I wasn't going to throw the couch, but I was definitely going to throw that...  If that would have been good, take out a homeless person sleeping on the sidewalk.  Randy from West Point, what's up? 
[03:35:30]  Yo, guys.  Welcome back.  Hey, listen, man.  That was the funniest shit I ever heard, but it's not as good as the time that you took  the sludge hammer to Al Duke's pinball machine.  Oh, yeah.  That was awful.  Well, people that are new to this program that have just subscribed and never heard us before,  yeah, this isn't the first time Opie's pulled stuff like this.  Opie is a psychopath, and he comes out with it. 
[03:36:00]  Every so often.  And this is a prime example.  For some reason, this woman comes in to bring us gifts, and he feels compelled to break things  and throw chips.  Well, the best was when we took the sledgehammer to the pinball machine.  That was very good.  The antique pinball machine.  The antique Rolling Stones pinball machine.  The Rolling Stones pinball machine.  And Opie trashed it with a sledgehammer.  What was a bigger cringe moment for me is when Limo Ant's kid sent that little gumball  machine for you.  God, yeah.  And you smashed it with a sledgehammer. 
[03:36:30]  His daughter gave you a gift.  Yeah, but the daughter wasn't in the studio.  It doesn't matter.  It was him.  It was his brother.  How about stalker Patty bringing us gifts for everything?  Christmas, anniversary of the show, birthdays, and Opie would unwrap it.  And usually they were, because Patty at the time couldn't afford anything.  So one time she got like this picture frame, and she bought a glue gun and glued like glitter  and macaroni on the picture frame.  And it spelt out, you know, happy birthday, Opie.  And Opie took it, unwrapped it, and slammed it against the console, where I didn't even 
[03:37:00]  think it could make that many pieces.  It came apart.  Holy shit.  You see your fucking head come apart like that.  That's how the macaroni laughs.  Hey, Steve.  You gotta put the video, if you can find it, of the pinball machine on foundrymusic.com  for the new listeners.  It's on there.  I'll put a link to it.  Yeah, put a link to the pinball smashing thing for the new listeners.  It'll be up on opieandansdy.com.  And also, FedEx, if I know him, he'll have the audio of the pinball smashing thing.  Come on, throw the poker chips for Manny and Sal. 
[03:37:30]  Go to oavirus.com for that audio.  All right, well, that was fun, right, guys?  No, it wasn't fun.  Doris was embarrassing.  Doris from Indiana, what's going on today?  Not much.  No?  No.  Why are you calling the show?  I want to play What's in My Pants.  You want to play What's in My Pants?  Yeah, yep.  You know how to play?  I think I'm perched.  What?  I think I do. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah?  All right.  It's where you take the phone and rub it on your intimate area, and we guess what kind  of hairstyle you have just from the sound.  Uh-huh.  And you know that.  Uh-huh.  All right.  You want to play or what?  We played this yesterday.  We're trying to balance this out.  We did play yesterday.  I think we should play it again.  She called in.  We'll do it quick.  We'll do a quick game.  What about this, though?  I know.  I want to do that.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What to do?  I kind of want to play.  Hey, um, how old a gal are you?  44.  All right.  We're going to play the retard clips.  All right.  Oh, we're going to go to the sound clips that we had. 
[03:38:30]  I love that bit.  We got, uh, the retard's doing the news clips.  Oh, I just want to punch out of this show today.  Um, yeah, let's play the retard clips.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Should we have Doris call in tomorrow?  Why don't you go smooth that one over?  Doris.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Hi.  Hi.  Uh, we might get to you, so hold on a line, all right?  All right.  44, though, huh?  Yep.  How many kids?  30.  Three kids?  Um, Anthony, we're going to play the, uh...  All right, let's pop that in the, uh, DVD, uh, CD player.  And play the, uh...  Simodial.  Yeah.  The retard clip?  Sure.  Natural, uh, childbirth or, uh, cesarean? 
[03:39:30]  Two were natural, and the last one was cesarean.  Oh, boy, look at the time, Anthony.  Um, we might have to leave.  Uh, for the week.  Wow.  Wow.  Hmm.  All right, well, how's your news?  Ben, go smooth that over.  We would love to talk to her tomorrow.  Yes.  Sure.  Two more years, she'll be able to call up and play, what's in my diaper?  Guess the hairstyle. 
[03:40:00]  Gray?  Uh, Doris?  Yes?  Jim Norton has something he wants to say to you.  Okay.  I really appreciate you calling the show, and I hope we get to you, because I think it'd  be fun to play the game with you.  Okay.  Do you have a bunt?  Excuse me?  A bunt.  A bunt?  A bunt.  You know what that is, a bunt cake?  You know, it's not a belly, and it's not a, it's a bunt.  I try.  No, I don't have a bunt cake.  All right.  A bunt cake.  Anthony, do you have anything to say to Doris? 
[03:40:30]  No.  Thank you for, uh, thank you for calling, and please hold on.  All right?  All right.  All right.  There's Doris from, uh, Indiana.  Indiana.  What's in my house dress?  She wants to help the show.  All right, Anthony, how's your news?  That's in my bloomers.  This is a, uh, a show they did on Trio?  Yeah.  This is, uh, retards doing the news.  Yeah.  They, they were at some camp or something, and all decided it would be kind of cool for  them to get together, something for them to do.  Uh, put on a news program. 
[03:41:00]  Right.  Where, where they would do interviews, and tape it, and broadcast it.  Right.  So, I think it's a very brave thing to do, Opie.  You know?  Just because they're, I call them, you know what I call them, Opie?  Handicapable.  A lot of people say handicapped.  I like saying handicapable.  Well, here's the deal with this.  They're not letting their handicaps, uh, get in the way of, of them fulfilling their  dreams.  And living a normal life.  Well, they were at the slowdown. 
[03:41:30]  We got audio of them at the, uh, Democratic Convention, um, interviewing celebrities.  Yes.  Yes.  And I'm sorry, man, but, uh, how could you not laugh when you listen to this?  And people would call you, you know, a jerk for laughing at this.  They would call you a jerk for laughing if they weren't calling you a jerk for the last  half hour of radio.  And, uh, I don't know.  It's just really funny.  I'm sorry.  It is funny.  And the people that they try to interview, because I guess they're trying to come across  as a legitimate news outlet, but they're retarded.  And, uh, the people that they interview put on that condescending, like, voice, like, oh, 
[03:42:00]  yeah, okay, and they know they have to be nice.  Right.  Like, if it was any schmuck with a microphone that came up to them and was trying to interview  them, they would, you know, brush them off.  Nah, I mean, nothing for you today.  All right.  But they're retarded, so they have to be nice, and you could hear it in their voice.  Well, we think, uh...  Well, this was on TRIO last night.  We're going to run out of time, so...  Hey, that's great!  Yeah, let's get to the clips, okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This is kind of the how's your news intro.  Listen to this. 
[03:42:30]  And I think one of them speaks to James Carvel for a little bit.  Is this the girl?  Yeah.  She's, uh, like three feet tall, in a wheelchair.  Is she in a wheelchair?  No?  No, no.  This one is, she, she, her head's kind of like this, and she kind of always looks out.  She's got this bent neck.  She's always looking up.  But she's only, she's only about three or four feet tall.  Yeah.  All right.  Excuse me, Mr. Carvel?  Yes, dear.  How do you feel about a news program being hosted by people with disabilities?  A new program hosted by people with disabilities? 
[03:43:00]  News.  News.  That would be great.  Well...  I think people with disabilities make an enormous contribution to this.  Well, that's exactly what we're doing here.  We're shooting for a man-on-the-street news documentary of our own that we're calling How's Your News?  Well, thank you, darling.  I have...  Hello, and welcome to How's Your News Convention Coverage 2004.  My name is Susan Harrington, and I'm a woman with disabilities who loves her life.  And I'm very excited to tell you all about this unique project we call How's Your News. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  Thank you very much, darling.  Well, thank you for honoring me by talking to me about this.  Thank you.  Anytime you want me on, you just let me know, sweetheart.  All right.  You know, he wants to say something.  The guy very opinionated.  Like, well, thank you for honoring me by talking to me.  Yeah.  Sure.  That's what you were thinking.  That's exactly what you were thinking.  All right.  And, hey, sir, let it be known that the feeling is mutual, okay?  All right.  I like the attitude of this program. 
[03:44:00]  How's Your News is a news team made up of people with various disabilities.  We all met at a summer camp many years ago, and it was at this camp that we came up with  the idea of making our very own version of the news.  One time at retard camp.  First, we got together with some counselors from the camp, and we selected a crack team  of six outgoing reporters.  Here they are.  This is Bobby.  Most of the time, we can't understand what he's saying, but he does understand us. 
[03:44:30]  And, hey, he always seems to get the scoop.  Oh, we just work here.  We just work here.  I'm sorry.  If you're not laughing at that.  Hilarious.  If you're not laughing at that, what, you're probably a decent human being?  Yes.  All of compassion.  We just work here, man. 
[03:45:00]  This here is Larry.  Like Bobby, he understands everything which is said to him.  But since he can't talk, we've made a board with four questions on it, and he uses the  mic to point out the one he wants to ask.  And this is...  What was that?  Ah!  Wait a minute.  Oh, God.  Hold on.  Here we go.  ...and he uses the mic to point out the one he wants to ask.  Wait, I recognize that he either asked about paramilitary operations in Iraq, or he shit 
[03:45:30]  his pants.  This is Sean Costello.  He's known for having a pretty subtle sense of humor.  Hey, I bet.  What?  Dude, why'd you give that love?  Dude.  No, because this is a serious story.  Jeremy here is 18 years old.  He's got a lot of energy and curiosity.  And he sure doesn't like to stay on one subject for very long. 
[03:46:00]  And ask his forgiveness, and stop that practice.  Do you have any favorite bands that you listen to?  And then there's Ronnie.  He loves celebrities, especially celebrities from the 1970s.  B.J. Honeycutt.  How the hell are you?  Yeah.  How you doing?  Good.  How's Alan Alda doing?  Tonight, you are very lucky because you have tuned in to our most exciting adventure today.  That's right, Susan.  Can you believe it?  This crew is going to the Democrat and Republican conventions. 
[03:46:30]  We're certainly not your typical news team.  But hey, maybe that's what this election needs is a little sense of humor.  Get ready for something completely different, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for How's Your News.  Oh, brother.  Oh, brother.  He's the funny one, I guess.  He's the one with retard strength. 
[03:47:00]  When he sees a celebrity, he runs over and he kind of grabs him and locks him in so they can't move.  Later on, there's a clip with Rob Reiner.  He gets him almost in a headlock, and Rob Reiner can't move.  He's petrified.  And of course, what's he going to do?  If he does anything, like punches him or something, you can't do that.  He's retarded.  Yeah, we got a problem on the phone line.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, I'm sorry.  I don't know if you're...  What?  The way you treated that lady.  What?  That brought that bullshit in, you know, brought that shit in for y'all. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  The way you treated her, you know, fuck this.  You know, if you don't even got enough common decency...  I can't understand him.  If his phone works a little better, we'll bring him back.  He said you should have enough common decency.  Decency.  He's pissed off at what you did, Opie.  And I, you know, I don't disagree with him.  I don't say he's wrong either.  I don't say he's wrong.  All right.  Let's go to the second clip.  How's your news, Anthony?  This is Peter Jennings. 
[03:48:00]  Right?  Yeah.  Okay, sir.  What's your name?  My name is Susan Harrington, and I'm one of the reporters.  Mine's Peter Jennings.  I work for ABC.  It's nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  How do you feel about being here at the convention?  I feel excited.  Do you feel excited about being here?  Yeah.  I think the excitement you're feeling is a two-way street.  I think if I had your voice and your charm, I'd get better ratings at night.  You fraudulent Canadian jizzbag. 
[03:48:30]  You would get more ratings because it would be a complete freak show.  Imagine him sitting there, Peter Jennings looking like he does and going,  Hi, it's Peter Jennings with the news.  I'd start watching the news again every night.  Everyone would watch.  Are you kidding me?  So he's absolutely right.  Oh, yes.  You hear how he all of a sudden was like, yeah.  And what's your name?  I would, what's your name?  Hmm.  Because if you don't tell me, I'll just think of you as drooling idiot. 
[03:49:00]  Bunch of corkies.  How nice to see you.  Thank you.  Well, thank you very much.  In the meantime, live from the floor of the Democratic Convention,  this is Susan Harrington reporting live for How's Young News.  I want to know why she laughed.  Did he tickle her clit with a pig's foot?  Coming up.  See what Hillary Clinton says when Sean and Larry catch up with her.  Oh, please don't change the dial to CBS or anything like that.  Just stay tuned. 
[03:49:30]  Well said.  Did I hear him say butt?  All right.  Jesus.  Come on.  They caught up with Al Franken in this clip.  Who's the retard in this clip?  You know, I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry.  All righty. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  I'm Al Franken and I'm recovering at this convention.  Yeah.  And are you having a good time?  All righty.  Who have you talked to so far?  I'm sorry.  Booyan.  Booyan.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  Maya.  I couldn't agree more.  Maya.  Yeah.  It was really nice talking to you. 
[03:50:30]  I'm glad you're here.  Yeah.  I think it's fabulous.  I, I, I, I, I, I shot.  I, I, I, I, I, I shot.  Can I shake your hand?  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  What's he saying?  Okay.  Have a good time.  What's he saying?  Al Franken is so uncomfortable in that clip.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.  What is that?  I don't know.  I wonder what he was trying to say.  Maybe someone out there speaks retard.  I don't know.  God damn how frustrating that must be.  Like, because I think the girl was saying that he, he can think, but he just can't talk. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  So he's trying to ask him something.  It's a horrible position to be in, too, because you know the camera's right on Al Franken.  Like, in his mind, it's probably like, oh, you asked, you know, hey, Al Franken, you  asshole liberal.  And it comes out, ah, bah, bah, ah, bah, bah.  Well, no, if he's a complete retard, he's probably telling Al Franken, I agree completely  with your political beliefs.  All right, um, here's Triumph, the insult comic dog.  Oh. 
[03:51:30]  Ooh.  What's your name?  What, Triumph, the insult comic dog?  Uh, comic dog, huh?  Yes.  Uh, what do you do, comic dog?  What am I doing?  Yeah, what do you do?  You know, I'm here to do what, uh, all the reporters are doing, you know, uh, ask questions  about the issues, uh, sniff their butts, hump their legs, that kind of thing.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Oh, oh, you could tell he was thrown. 
[03:52:00]  He was a little thrown.  He wasn't thrown.  He wanted, that was, if he had any balls, he would have attacked that dumbbell right there.  Thank you.  Why not?  Why not?  That's great.  You have great chromosomes for me to poop on.  That's great.  Where's your mother, the one pregnant, drinking and smoking?  So, at what trimester did your father punch your mother in the stomach? 
[03:52:30]  Look at your haircut.  My hairdo is better around my asshole.  I'd rather have a conversation with the cigar in my mouth.  Look at your head.  It's huge.  You look like a boxer.  I've looked at the smaller heads humping a great dame from behind. 
[03:53:00]  That is a huge head.  Oh, my God.  This show is awful.  He lost his balls.  He did.  He didn't go after him.  He was all, ah, yes, we're here to cover the election.  I believe he was neutered.  Your parents should have been spayed and neutered to keep freaks like you from walking the earth. 
[03:53:30]  All right.  The way you stand there like a stump, I was going to pee on you.  I mistook you for a tree.  Then I realized a tree is smarter.  Pete Rose called.  He wants his hair back.  And he's betting five to one.  You're not even human.  Oh, man.  We have time maybe for like one or two more of these. 
[03:54:00]  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing the meathead.  All in the family.  And, of course, we used to sing that sing song.  And today, by the way.  Could you stop for a second?  By the way.  First of all, Rob Reiner does not want to be called the meathead ever.  The guy is now a director.  He, you know, he was the meathead on All in the Family.  But you don't want to be called that after you've moved on for 40 years or whatever it's been. 
[03:54:30]  And here he comes.  He's got to be.  You know, if anyone else called him meathead, he wouldn't give him the time of day  and would walk away.  But here he's a retarded.  So he's got to entertain this guy.  Hi, this is Ronnie Simonson.  Today I'm interviewing the meathead.  All in the family.  And, of course, we used to sing that sing song.  And today...  By the way, Glenn Miller played.  By the way, Glenn Miller played.  By some days, the head parlayed.  Guys are like we had it, man.  Those were the days. 
[03:55:00]  And you know what you were then.  Girls were girls and men were men.  Mister, we could use a Democrat party like Kerry again.  There you go.  Oh, God.  Mister, we could use a hanger if your mother gets pregnant again.  Oh, my God. 
[03:55:30]  You asshole.  I'm drooling like a retard.  Oh, God.  Oh, that got me.  That'll be a promo. 
[03:56:00]  I hear a new Jimmy sing.  Oh, you made me cry.  I just can't help.  I laughed.  Oh, you made me cry.  Do we have time for one more?  We need to go late today.  Is that possible?  I don't even know if the system's set up.  Listen to Wolf Blitzer being a dick to the kid.  When Kerry gets elected, what would you like to see Kerry and Edwards change as far as changes to come in this country?  You're pretty positive that they're going to be elected, are you? 
[03:56:30]  Because, you know, there's another side, the Republicans, they want to get elected, too.  Oh, I know, but right now I'm just thinking.  I think you're meant to say if they get elected.  Right, if and when, yeah.  Well, you keep saying when.  You don't know for sure they're going to get elected, do you?  Right, but I'm saying if.  I meant to say if and when.  If they get elected.  Yeah.  Because the Republicans might get elected.  Right.  We don't know.  The election's very close.  That's true.  So what's the question again?  But if and when Kerry and Edwards get elected, what would you like to see them change? 
[03:57:00]  He was brutal with her.  What's the question, you retard?  I like Wolf.  Yeah, right?  The only one that actually stood up to those retards.  How many times have I said it's stupid?  Genetic embarrassment.  Wipe your mouth.  30 seconds.  30 seconds left in the program?  All right, well, I guess we'll save the rest of this audio for tomorrow or Monday, all right?  We sure had fun today, didn't we, Stimpy? 
[03:57:30]  We sure did.  Oh, God.  Man, if you're just tuning in this show today, it's definitely worth listening to.  I'm going to listen back to the replay.  When Jimmy sings that song, it's over for me.  Yeah.  God.  Oh, three, two, one.  See you tomorrow.  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive picture?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  This is Mike Matthews. 
[03:58:00]  This is Mike Matthews.  Collection?  Mm-hmm.  I'm calling in regards to your delinquent account with Dr. Tom.  Yeah?  It has been turned into our collection agency for the amount of $43.  You've got to be kidding me.  No, sir, I'm not.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Let me tell you something.  That doctor had me come in about six months ago for a full physical,  put me there in his little examination room,  told me to get naked.  I'm sitting there by that necker for about 20 minutes.  Finally, he comes in and says,  put this gown on.  I tell you, the gown had lace on it. 
[03:58:30]  And he told me, finally, he said,  I want to check my prostate out.  I told him to bend over.  So I'm thinking, hey, he's a doctor.  He's going there.  I'm bending over.  So I'm checking my prostate.  Turn around, the guy had both hands on my shoulder.  I'm thinking damn bit funny right now.  He's in there laughing.  My experience, I got through.  Sir?  Yeah?  Your medical history is irrelevant, sir.  I'm telling you, he's not getting no money from me.  I went there to get a physical.  Told me to put a nightie on.  I put, thank God, he took my prostate out. 
[03:59:00]  Had both hands on my shoulders and everything.  I can't even look at my wife the same way.  Come out, Bob's cutting the grass next door.  And I get kind of sexually aroused.  I don't even know which way I'm coming or going.  Do you understand?  Have you talked to them over there?  Have you talked to them?  Yes, I have, sir.  I've talked to their...  Did he ask about me?  No, the doctor's not even involved.  I'm talking to the county department.  I mean, he's still jogging and working out the weights and everything.  I have no idea, sir.  He's getting kind of buffed there for a while.  I think he's a little bit like Brad Pitt. 
[03:59:30]  You know, he's kind of...  Sir, is your good credit history worth $43?  And a lot of opportunity for $43?  Don't worry about that damn $43.  Maybe I'll call him up.  If he didn't hear him calling me right now, he'd probably be pissed.  He don't know that you're...  I'm sure the hell he don't know what this is all about.  Sir, your account is the turnover, Dad.  It leaves our hands and goes into the lawyer's hands.  That's much more.  Tell you what, you're about as much pain in the ass as he was.  I'm going to go.  You can screw you, buddy.  Heather.  A minute with Bob Edwards and Doc Watson. 
[04:00:00]  You know, if you hadn't boarded that bus for the coffee houses of New York and Boston  and all back in 62 at the peak of the folk revival, what would you have done?  Would you have played dances back in North Carolina?  I would have, but I would never have been a success just doing that.  It was in the spring, one sunny day, my sweetheart left me, Lord, she went away.  I did quite a few trips to New York on that Trailways Express that ran from Memphis up to Port Authority Station there in New York by myself. 
[04:00:30]  I wouldn't have nerve to do that now.  The Bob Edwards Show on XMPR, Channel 133, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. Pacific.  Well, Bob, it's been a pleasure.  We'll do it again sometime.  I appreciate it.  Is that enough?  Yeah, I think that's fine.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio, XM satellite radio, radio to the power of X. 
[04:01:00]  So, I think that now, you know, set a demo of XM gas.  It's right.  It's easy.  It's safe within a couple of days.  It's difficult.  It's okay.  It's safe, thanks.  It's okay.  It's crazy.  It's fabulous.  It's pleasant. 
[04:01:30]  It's truly EE 3C-9 oil.  lain time, society.  It's a new Зд dire.  Thank you. </pre>
