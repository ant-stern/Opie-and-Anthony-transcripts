<pre> 1027WNEW, the rock of New York, Two for Tuesday with R.E.M.  That's the Sorry song.  A lot of people don't know what the real title of that song is, Anthony.  It's called South Central Rain from the Racking CD.  And Orange Crush from Green before that.  And there's Two for Tuesday.  On the way we got some ACDC.  Oh, we're playing Money Talks today.  Very cool.  All right.  It's an EDGE CD, a fine CD by the band.  You have the music in front of us there.  Are we rocking today?  We are definitely rocking, Anthony. 
[00:30]
 I must say.  Let me take a peek at the Two first coming up.  Take a little Two for peek.  I'm going to take a peek at the Two first.  You two, Stones, Springsteen, like it.  Petty, okay, very good.  Arrowsmith, Metallica, Doris.  Oh, good, good.  Meat and Potato, Rock and Roll.  That's what I like.  I like it.  Van Halen, Bowie, Crows.  And Melonhead.  Very nice.  Nothing silly in there?  Honestly, no.  Good.  Good.  Every song we're playing.  Well, except for that one.  But that's okay. 
[01:00]
 But you can't like them all.  That's obvious.  But as long as there's nothing silly.  No, nothing silly.  We'll make believe we love every song.  Okay.  Want to stay in the truth?  All right.  I mean, you can't honestly say, you know, you're tuning in your favorite radio station, you  honestly think the jock likes every song he plays?  Well, and they talk like this, they do.  That's kind of silly.  I like every song we're playing.  That's kind of silly to think that.  Yeah.  And I guess if you're in the business, it's sacrilegious to talk about the talk bad about 
[01:30]
 the music you play.  Right.  So there's a song in there that you don't really care for.  One or two.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll try to we'll try to figure them out.  No, no.  I'll try to figure them out.  All right.  You could try to figure out as I go along today.  You can play along at home.  Try to figure out which songs Opie doesn't like.  Listen for the listen for the sarcasm.  All right.  What do you want to do here?  There's a lot to do.  Yeah, we're getting a ton of faxes and phone calls. 
[02:00]
 People want to hear the William Shatner game analysis from the jet Broncos.  Well, everybody's been doing game analysis.  Yeah.  And they look at the game.  They see what the problems were, where the jets went wrong.  It's been hashed and rehashed.  Maybe on the fan you're back in the red dog.  I'm not going to get a game.  They deserve a lot of credit for their spectacular run that you had all season long.  I obviously had quite a problem with the Broncos.  Are they still talking about the game over there?  Oh, of course. 
[02:30]
 Got to get Bill Parcells a lot of credit.  He's coming back for another season.  Bill Parcells obviously has to come back and he wants to go out of winter.  So he's got the team.  He could go all the different.  Maybe next year.  That's right.  All right, listen, we can make this our jets break.  This group is the Scott Van Dusen.  Is this the same Scott Van Dusen I worked with in Rochester?  You radio people don't know each other. 
[03:00]
 You're one big happy family.  I worked with a Scott Van Dusen in Rochester at WCMS.  Anyway, didn't I work with Seymour Dix back out in Frisco?  I believe it was 68.  Sure, that was Seymour Dix, wasn't it?  Was it the Seymour Dix?  No, no, there was a Seymour Dix out of Missouri.  I remember at K.  Ellen Huell.  And then there was a Seymour Dix out in Frisco and a Seymour Dix out in San Diego.  You know, the sad part is there's another Opie working in this business. 
[03:30]
 Yeah.  And this has been my stupid nickname since I was a kid.  It's not even a radio name.  Yeah, you got screwed.  I really didn't get screwed.  You picked a wacky radio name.  Opie.  Hey.  Yeah, I would have picked this one.  And then I have to be, my real name has to be Anthony.  So people get confused going, oh, Opie and Andy, that's cute.  It's a Mayberry thing.  All right, would you like to hear the Jet song?  Yes, I want to hear this.  This is about the the lost Sunday. 
[04:00]
 OK, so as you don't like it, tell me and we'll get rid of it.  All right.  Not bad, not bad.  Oh, he can sing. 
[04:30]
 That's all right.  Oh, that's a low blow. 
[05:00]
 Yeah. 
[05:30]
 Wow. 
[06:00]
 Well, it was all right.  It had potential.  They only had two days to write it, though.  I wonder what David Coverdell's been up to.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I wish you want me to file this.  Yeah, you could file the show.  It's losing song.  We'll probably play it again later on, because it's really good.  Yeah, I think so.  I'm sure all the people that suffer through watching the Jets lose really appreciate hearing that. 
[06:30]
 Yeah. So once we decide to play, all right.  All right.  Yeah, that'll stay right there.  The Rock of New York, one of two seven W.  A.W. two for Tuesday with ACBC off the razor's edge.  That is Money Talks.  This razor's edge CD.  Very, very good.  Very good.  It's overlooked by many rock stations around the country, unfortunately, but there's a bunch of ditties on this thing that are great songs for the radio, including Thunderstruck. 
[07:00]
 All right.  You don't care about my little ACDC rap.  I'm looking as you're talking, I'm looking at instant feedback, jotting some things down, Opie.  I'm very busy on the side of the console.  Sure you are.  What are you doing over there?  I was writing some stuff down for our Clinton bit that's coming up.  I mean, oops.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that could be maybe. 
[07:30]
 OK, well, let's play the William Shatner from yesterday.  If I can find it here.  Yeah, I mean, we don't want to just, you know, pound the Jets lost to death here, but William Shatner was in yesterday and he analyzed the Jets performance against the Broncos.  Unique analysis.  So check this out.  Greetings.  I have a few thoughts on the game, Opie.  Anthony, let me speak.  OK. 
[08:00]
 This John O-Way is a lot like the Gorn, I thought, with those huge teeth.  I believe if a couple of members of the Jets could have found some sulfur and diamonds and a bamboo tube and fashioned an impromptu cannon, they could have fired it at him, as I did against the Gorn.  Thus, Karen, being victory.  Tyrell Davis, much like the burrowing Horta made of rock, was able to burrow through solid rock with acid. 
[08:30]
 Why didn't Barcelles mind meld with Tyrell, telling him they were on a mission of peace for the good of man?  That would have worked, I believe, in stopping Tyrell.  How about Vinny Testaverde?  If only they could have implanted the Romulan cloaking device in him, rendering him invisible, so they could not see where he was passing the ball, only to become visible as he passes the ball. 
[09:00]
 Well, that seems logical.  Why couldn't they get the Romulan cloaking device?  And finally, maybe if they would have defeated them as I defeated the Gamesters of Triskelion, with a battle to the death with a morgue, thus freeing the enslaved thralls.  This could have worked. 
[09:30]
 That's my analysis on the game.  Mr. Sulu, get us out of here, or you make a lot of sense.  Oh, there he goes.  I get it.  Wow, he did make a lot of sense.  If only they could have fashioned the cannon and shot Elway with it like he did the Gorn.  It makes perfect sense.  You know, you have too much time with this.  The Rock of New York, 1027W, and EW2 for Tuesday with U2 from the Joshua Tree, Bullet the Blue Sky. 
[10:00]
 By the way, my favorite CD of the 80s.  Is it?  Joshua Tree.  Not many great albums came out of the 80s.  No.  Appetite Destruction did.  Joshua Tree.  What is your favorite album of the 80s?  Of the 80s?  Would it be Kajagoogoo's greatest hits?  Yes, yes.  Yeah, I couldn't get enough of Too Shy Shy, that you had to buy the whole album.  Oh, yeah.  See if they had a follow-up hit.  Yeah.  Culture Club.  Culture Club was one of your...  Another big, big favorite of mine.  One of your faves. 
[10:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  I think you were into that band, huh?  Just give me any 80s fag band.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm there, Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Adamant?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Giddy Two Shoes?  That fits you.  Of course.  You're a jackass today.  I'm just smart as you'll wound up.  I wound up filled with sarcasm today.  Well, I think Congrats are in order for Jimmy.  Yes. 
[11:00]
 No matter how much we bitched about the evolution of the rock of New York, remember that little  dark period that we had to go through?  Well, he won an Air Award.  Yes, he did.  What is it?  Artists and radio?  Radio or something like that.  Yeah.  It's truly an honor.  Right.  And Jimmy brought home the hardware for N.A.W.  Because he did a great job on it.  Yes.  You know?  He produced the whole thing, all the cool sweepers and the news clips and the montage  and it was very well produced. 
[11:30]
 And he walked away with the award.  We just didn't agree with the concept at the time.  No.  But Jimmy was rewarded for his hard work today and we want to congratulate him.  Congratulations.  All right.  We didn't get any awards.  We didn't even submit.  I don't think we'll be getting any awards.  We didn't even submit though.  I know.  We don't submit to awards.  I know.  It's a big kiss ass.  I hate awards.  We were voted runner up best afternoon drive show in the country though. 
[12:00]
 Yeah.  Isn't that funny?  I guess our peers.  It was in one of the trade magazines.  Well, I'm honored, Opie.  Did our peers feel that?  That came out December 18th, I think.  But we didn't get an award for that because I guess we were runner ups or something.  Runner ups.  Always sloppy seconds for the Opie and Anthony show.  Who cares?  All right.  On line one we got someone that has an observation about Star Trek.  Okay.  One of your favorite shows, Anthony.  Good. 
[12:30]
 Hi, NW.  Hey, Ann.  Is it just me or did that doomsday machine look like a giant doobie?  A big doobie.  Yeah, and it was even burning kind of thing.  It was.  It had a live head, you know.  It was a little pinched down.  It looked like it might have been chewed on a little bit on the end.  But it was a big fat doober.  And you said something the other day that just killed me, man, but I can't remember the frigging name of it.  You remember Gummy the Dwarf from the Tholian Web? 
[13:00]
 Yeah.  What drink did he offer Kirk?  Captain Kirk, have some Tranya.  Tranya.  Oh my God.  How the hell you remember that shit?  Tranya.  Tranya.  Well, listen, I got a work call, guys.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  The word of the day is Tranya, Captain Kirk.  We are a lot alike, both proud of our ships. 
[13:30]
 That was Ron Howard's brother.  Yes.  What's his name?  Clint Howard.  Clint Howard.  He was a little fidget back then, and they put him in the spaceship.  And he's sitting in that chair.  With that big, huge forehead of his?  Oh, he had a shaved head and everything.  A light-bulb head that he's got working.  Huge light bulb head and these gnarly teeth.  Captain Kirk, I was testing you.  Have some Tranya.  Love that joke, damn it.  Hey, we want to say hi to all the members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club checking in. 
[14:00]
 Yeah.  To the program this afternoon.  We got the Hummer Queen song here.  Oh yeah.  For all the members.  And we are encouraging everyone out there to send in their Tuesday Night Hummer songs.  Oh, Opie, Opie.  People will never learn how to use the Internet.  I got an email here from Joe.  He says, hey guys, I listened last Friday.  It sounded like loads of fun.  But the pictures on the website are too small.  And do not do the event justice it deserves. 
[14:30]
 He's talking about the smash the Bronco thing we did Friday.  Yeah.  And see if you can enlarge the pics and repost them to the site.  Rock on.  Joe, those are what are called thumbnails.  See, they're a little preview of the picture that if you click on it, they get bigger.  They get bigger.  Much bigger.  Yeah.  They look great on the website.  They really look good.  So if you're online right now, go to www.wnew.com.  Joe, you're nuts.  The Rock of New York 1027, WNEW, The Rolling Stones, 2 for Tuesday, Monkey Man. 
[15:00]
 So now Mick Jagger's claiming in the paper that he was never officially married to Jerry Hall.  Yeah.  That's cute.  Damn Mick, banging all our broads.  Save some for the rest of us, will you?  This guy is unbelievable.  Think she's going to get the money eventually?  She'll get something.  She wants 50 million.  50 million.  How does anyone rate that kind of change in a divorce settlement?  I don't get it.  I don't get it either. 
[15:30]
 What is anything like that or the lawsuits that people bring up that, you know, I lost  my pinky.  So I want a million dollars or I want 50 million dollars.  Or you spill coffee on your lap.  Yeah.  Your fault and you're suing for 10 million dollars.  Usually it's some old bag.  She's shaking while she's taking the lid off and she spills it in a lap.  I think a younger woman should get more money if she spills hot coffee in a lap.  At least she's using it or something.  It's not like you're damaging anything that's being used. 
[16:00]
 Now how dare you state that old people don't F.  Hey, I don't want to think about it.  Every time that stupid Golden Girls show is on and they're all talking about sex and  how, oh boy, I was with this man last night and oh, we had a, oh, Rue McClenahan.  I want to think about that.  You know, we've got to start doing our radio show from our car.  I guess we've got to expose another one of our bits when we drive in.  Uh-oh.  The Yoshi the Pork Man developed when we were driving into Manhattan. 
[16:30]
 That's where all the Asian delivery guys and their bikes with their delivery basket and  stuff.  That's where that bit developed just coming into the city.  You're going to get into this.  Our new one is when we're at, we're just not meant for society.  We should be locked up.  When we stop at the lights in Manhattan, we look around and we just goof on every single  person we see.  First of all, it's what everyone does.  And then when we see a really old lady, Anthony goes, you know, there was a time when she 
[17:00]
 was hot.  She went.  She went.  Think she still goes?  You can picture, you know, it's like 1910 and she's just, you know, going to town.  She's a hot, you know, chick living in Manhattan and then she goes.  Yeah.  Now she's really old and wrinkled up.  She's just like decrepit with the walker with the little spokes on them, like the four pronged 
[17:30]
 walker, which is walking down the street with the training walker attached.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or she's in a little rascal scooter and you just look and think like, man, maybe, you know,  1920.  She used to go.  Yeah.  There's a prohibition going on.  She goes to the speakeasies, you know, she's a flapper.  It's like now look at her and she's like, Hey, she's a hot looking dame.  Twenty three skidoo.  Hubba hubba.  You know?  And she's getting some.  Yeah.  And now it's just a crazy kind of walking down the street.  It's just a bad bit. 
[18:00]
 Just, just horrible.  You know, you got to wonder.  Of course you wonder.  Not in a sexual way.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not looking at these old women thinking, no, hottie.  Just thinking, you know, in their past, which ones were like the whores and which ones,  no, cause even now, you know, they're a girl.  That's how far you go with the bed too.  Well, there are girls that are, you know, if she was a virgin when she got married or  if she was a slut and did everyone.  That's a poor old lady with a walker on the side of the road. 
[18:30]
 Doesn't matter.  Look now, there are women and girls, women that are, that are virtuous, you know, and  then there are whores.  It wasn't any different back then.  You see an old woman with that funny hats that they wear and the big shellac hairdos  that they have done at the parlor every month.  And you wonder, you know, was she a whore?  Or was she one of the virtuous ones?  A lot of thinking on the way in.  We keep ourselves entertained. 
[19:00]
 Factsline 212957WNW.  Chris, we get our best stuff from the faithful listeners.  Yes, we do.  Chris writes, I found some photos of Anthony's new crush.  I hope you enjoy them and have your crayons to call them all in.  What is it?  Coloring book pages?  Well, he sent seven pages from the Big Comfy Couch coloring book, Anthony.  Oh, man.  I didn't even know about this show until yesterday.  Hey, I like Alison Court.  And now explain what the Big Comfy Couch show is all about. 
[19:30]
 I've never seen it.  I saw her do a little appearance on Rosie O'Donnell the other day and she's a, she's  a lunette, this clown.  Just pigtails.  Yeah, yeah.  And freckles and a clown nose.  And Anthony thinks she's hot.  Well, she's 25 and you add a makeup.  She's really hot.  All right.  Well, yeah.  Well, Chris sent in the pages from the coloring book and there's your new girlfriend sitting  on our cute, you know, comfy couch with her little comfy couch doll.  And underneath it says, let's get comfy, Anthony. 
[20:00]
 How does this guy?  Come on.  You send your coloring book pages?  Yeah, and you're supposed to color these in.  Oh.  And then you got your new girlfriend.  She's on her big comfy couch and she's got her doctor gear on.  Yeah.  And she's got the scope on the comfy couch doll.  And underneath it says, I'd like to get naked and play doctor.  Now there's your hot girlfriend with her pigtails bending over the big comfy couch rearranging  things. 
[20:30]
 Yeah.  And then underneath it says, let me tidy things up.  Gee, I hope that there isn't some greasy looking perverted sicko standing behind me while I  bend over here.  She's a dirty clown.  Her listeners have way too much time.  And then this is brutal.  You got your brand new girlfriend in her clown getup with her comfy couch doll on the big  letter F block.  Right.  She's on a block with the big letter F on it.  I wonder what this person wrote.  Anthony, F me, you big perverted clown loving pedophile.  Come on. 
[21:00]
 She's 25 years old.  But she's playing an eight year old.  No, she's not.  She's playing a clown.  She's playing an eight year old.  She is not.  Look at her.  Look at her.  I got pictures of her here out of makeup.  She's supposed to be a little girl on her comfy couch with a comfy couch little dolly.  I've never seen the comfy couch.  Just because the actress is 25, she's playing an eight year old and you think she's hot.  I've never seen the comfy couch show.  I'm saying the girl, Alison Court, that plays Lunette the Clown is hot, not Lunette the 
[21:30]
 Clown.  I don't even know why I have to explain things like this.  All right.  There you go.  Thanks for sending that in.  Oh, wait, why am I throwing that away?  I'm sure you're going to want to color this in.  Of course, I'll be.  Yes, I'm coloring it in now.  Yeah.  Here you go.  One oh two seven WNEW, the Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday with Bruce Springsteen, Adam  raised a cane and double with the blue dress from the No Nukes soundtrack.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Getting some email here on the pictures that are up on the WNEW website. 
[22:00]
 A little Jets promotion that we did on Friday.  That was a huge success.  We had a front page of the record over the weekend.  Yeah.  And it was shown on TV all over the ball field.  It's pretty good.  We had a lot of people there.  And it was a party.  See, Jeff says, I've never seen a Bronco destroyed like that.  Excellent promo.  Can't wait to see the next sick idea you guys come up with.  We already have the next idea.  If you want to check out the pictures, they're on the NW website. 
[22:30]
 There's about 15 of them or so.  Yeah, I think so.  Our next idea, we want to start this concept where we go out every, I don't know, once a month or so, maybe a little longer than that.  Yeah.  And it's called Get Your Aggression Out on Friday or something like that.  It's tied into F You Friday.  To get your aggressions out, we're going to give you the opportunity to destroy certain things that might just piss you off during life.  Now we've partied in Manhattan.  We've taken the show to Jersey. 
[23:00]
 We want to go to Long Island next.  Yeah.  Want to find a cool bar that has a cool happy hour.  Want to get everybody out there.  This is down the road.  We're not going to do it like this Friday, but maybe in a couple of weeks or so or maybe in a month, whatever.  No, this was a good icebreaker because we're going to do a lot more.  We love being out there.  We love being out and about.  So we want to get a bunch of pianos and have people smash that with sledgehammers because I think that would sound really wild on the radio.  A little sledgehammer concerto.  Yes.  And then we want chopsticks. 
[23:30]
 And then I want to challenge Anthony to a round of Tic Tac Rosie.  And it's a concept we came up with last night on the ride home.  I like it. Big TVs. Nine of them. Set up like Hollywood squares.  And then we just have Rosie on all the TVs.  And me and you throw bowling balls at it and try to get a Tic Tac toe.  Because a bowling ball through a TV is just...  God, you've got to love how that looks and sounds.  Especially when the TV is plugged in. It's pretty fun. 
[24:00]
 It's got Rosie on there.  So that's what we're trying to develop for the next road show.  Okay?  Stay tuned.  And if you have an idea, we'd listen to everyone.  Some of our best ideas come from you guys.  You know, you could either email us or send some instant feedback or you could fax us.  Just get a hold of us with your wacky ideas.  Thank you.  Okay. We had an exclusive yesterday, Anthony.  Yes, we did.  We don't want to keep talking about the Jets' loss.  It's kind of sad.  The Giants fans are all laughing and saying, I told you so and all that. 
[24:30]
 It hurts.  There's no need to get like that.  It hurts.  Yeah.  But, uh...  We'll get... we'll move on.  I guess.  Well, I can't follow the next, especially if they sign Spreewell.  Ah, Spreewell.  Probably getting signed to the next.  That's crazy.  They're going to give Jeff Van Gundy neck braces?  Big metal collar.  Big metal collars for every game? 
[25:00]
 New York doesn't need a championship that bad that they have to go out and get Spreewell.  A thug.  Another reason I'm not following basketball this year, even though I know every move that is happening in the NBA, I'm that pathetic as much as I try not to pay attention.  And now I got the Islanders. That's my team.  Oh.  Have they lost like what, 250 games in a row at this point?  What happened?  Started the season off on the right foot and now they've lost, I think, 89 games in a row, Anthony. 
[25:30]
 Maybe they're afraid that scoreboard is going to fall on their head at the Coliseum.  That's what's happening. That's right. Remember?  Yeah, they didn't even want to play at the Coliseum. They want a new place to play because they said the scoreboard isn't safe.  They've come crashing down on the ice.  So do you think that maybe the team is too busy looking up instead of playing the game?  That's it. If you were looking where you're supposed to be passing and shooting the puck, instead of going, oh, God, is it going to fall this time?  As you skate under the scoreboard. 
[26:00]
 I say give them a new place.  I know they'll do better.  Yeah, you're right.  But I'm going to state right now, Islanders, my team, my team.  Just so in years to come.  So in 10 years when they maybe make it back into the cup.  You're not a bandwagon jumper.  Right. You guys will know that I've always followed the bastards.  Okay.  All right. Anyway, speaking of the Jets game, this was an exclusive for us in our show.  Very proud. But it's a national story now.  There is a fan at the game on Sunday at Mile High Stadium. 
[26:30]
 Yeah.  And he got hurt really, really bad.  A Jets fan, yeah.  And who does he call? Does he call Larry King? Does he call CNN? Does he call ESPN? No, he called us Anthony.  I know.  Super Tuesday with Aerosmith on the Rock in New York.  One oh two seven WNEW, Last Child and What It Takes.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, how are you?  Very well.  Once again, I want to say hi to all the members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Being inducted as we speak.  And to the people that aren't members yet, good luck to you tonight. 
[27:00]
 Good luck.  We got another one of our Tuesday Night Hummer Club songs on the way.  Yeah, it's a fan favorite, the Blow Me song.  Oh, yeah. You hardly even know me.  Haven't played that in a couple weeks, so stick around for that.  So, I think we got a guy on line six here that has some observations about you.  Me?  Yeah.  What do I do?  The faithful listeners, they listen very closely and they pick up on things, Anthony.  Okay.  Hi, ANEW.  Opie, Anthony, it's Paul. How are you? 
[27:30]
 Hey, Paul.  I'm worried you guys are getting into the pedophile stuff.  You started talking about that and this is what I thought of.  School buses, Anthony Sportswood.  Comfy couch, Anthony Sportswood.  Teenage tennis players, Anthony Sportswood.  And which one of you are into the Olsen twins?  Anthony, I just said we were six years away from being able to have a legitimate threesome with the Olsen twins. 
[28:00]
 I have never made any pedophile jokes.  You said that OJ Simpson's daughter used to be hot.  She got fat.  Come on.  What is that?  Oh yeah, I did say that.  You guys are going under the surface.  The FCC is coming after you.  Come on.  All right, well, let's get off the subject.  I just want to wish Jody Sweeten a happy 17th birthday.  The blonde girl from Full House.  One year to go. 
[28:30]
 All right, man.  We got to go.  Okay.  Thanks, Paul.  Bye bye.  One year.  Happy birthday, Jody.  You're 18 in one year.  I saw some new pictures of her somebody sent me.  Really?  Yeah.  There's a girl out there that...  She's a dirty girl.  There's a girl out there that loves when you do the dirty girl voice.  Yeah.  Where's that instant feedback?  We're getting a lot of instant feedback today.  Thank you, people.  Jackie from Ramsey. 
[29:00]
 She says, I love the, you're a dirty girl, aren't you, voice.  It gives me the chills every time I hear it.  Love you, Anthony.  Thank you, Jackie.  Jackie out there in Ramsey.  Oh, you're such a dirty girl, aren't you, Jackie?  You're a dirty, filthy girl.  You like it dirty, don't you?  I bet.  Yes, you do.  I'm watching you.  It's like the perverted Bob Ross.  I'm going to put some lizard and crimson on your ass.  Yeah. 
[29:30]
 Yeah, this is how I work my brush.  Yeah, look how I paint mushrooms.  I dip this in the brown.  There, it's a mushroom.  It's a dirty mushroom, isn't it?  My big afro looks like a 70s porno film, doesn't it?  Yeah.  My God.  Oh, damn, Bob Ross is dead.  Yeah.  I used to have so much fun just watching him paint. 
[30:00]
 It's like, wasn't that fun?  It's like, how the hell did he do that?  Yeah, like a half hour he would do this mint painting.  He couldn't even fathom being able to paint like that.  And he's like, yeah, you just pick up a spatula, you know,  now get your mixer from the kitchen and it's beautiful.  It's a mountain.  If I did it, it would look like I used a spatula and a mixer.  It makes a forest.  It makes a bomb.  It makes you feel retarded like you can't do this.  Yeah.  Look, we just dip my big afro into some liquid white. 
[30:30]
 And I'm just going to push my head into this canvas.  There, look at those buffy clouds.  Isn't that great?  Let me get my beard.  I'm going to dip my beard in this brown color.  There's a happy little bush.  I made it out of my beard.  That's where the rabbits live.  And my big hairy ass.  Oh, here we go.  My big hairy ass.  I'm going to sit in a little bit of this blue, this aqua blue. 
[31:00]
 I'm going to make a river.  Here we go.  There it is.  I just took my big hairy afro ass, sat it in the blue.  Look at that.  It's got, it's a little water hole, isn't it?  I made a watering hole.  Look at here, a little cave where the little snakes live.  I never use regular painting utensils.  Paint with a brick.  What else is going on?  Well, I see in the paper Bill Clinton, Opie. 
[31:30]
 Always a favorite.  You want to save the Clinton bit?  I think we gave the listeners a lot this break here.  I think we should let them just kind of hang out and sit back and reflect on what we just gave them, Anthony.  Coming up next, we'll be talking about Bill Clinton.  Got to spread out the bits a little bit here.  Wow, are you listening to Gary Waltz?  All right.  No comment. 
[32:00]
 Okay.  And also on the way, is Corky Steinbrenner really making an appearance today?  Hey, where's Black Earl?  Black Earl, we need to talk to Black Earl in a little while here.  About?  I was just reading all the instant feedback while the commercials were playing.  And everyone's checking out the pictures from the Smash the Bronco thing we did Friday.  And Manny's and Minaki.  Yes.  And everyone loved the pictures.  Check them out for yourself on the NAW website.  But all the faithful listeners are sitting there going, where's the picture of the girl that flashed her boobs on top of the Bronco? 
[32:30]
 The girl got on top of the Bronco and flashed the entire crowd.  She whipped them out.  It was great.  And she swears she's going to be the one that does it on the Today Show for the thousand dollars, by the way.  Yeah, that's what she said at first.  And we're like, well, why don't you give these people here a preview?  And of course, everyone just was like, wow.  They freaked out.  Yeah.  We got to talk to Black Earl.  It was his job to get the photo of the girl.  He got every other photo, but that one.  I want to find out what happened.  You think he was shaking too much with the camera or something? 
[33:00]
 Maybe.  That was, as my brother likes to say, major dairy.  1027WNAW, the Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday, Metallica from Garage Inc., Whiskey in the Jar.  And until it sleeps from load, it's opiate, Anthony.  Hey.  Now, Anthony, you got the pictures up and running.  Yeah.  WNAW.com.  Got 15 pictures from our Smash the Bronco thing we did Friday at Manny's in Minnaki. 
[33:30]
 Good pics.  You see the Bronco in various states of being destroyed by the people that were down there.  And a nice group shot of all the people on the overturned Bronco with weapons and things they used to destroy the Bronco.  But some people are emailing us some, just about every single one of our listeners.  There's a picture that's mysteriously missing.  Picture mysteriously absent.  Unsolved mysteries. 
[34:00]
 Earl took the pictures, but when they made it to the website, the pictures of the boobs were mysteriously absent.  Hmm.  We went to Earl.  Well, we got Black Earl in the studio.  What happened, Earl?  And you see I have to separate Black and Earl because a lot of people think I say Black Girl.  It's Black Earl.  Black Girl.  Now, Earl was in charge of taking the pictures.  Earl was in charge of our whole broadcast at Manny's, now that I think about it. 
[34:30]
 So maybe we shouldn't write him too hard here.  But it was one of his jobs to take all the pictures.  Yes.  One happened when the girl was showing her boobs on top of the Bronco.  Now, you told me on air, and you can hear it on the air, say, Earl, take a picture.  So I got the camera ready, took the picture.  Now, when we downloaded the shot, now the digital camera isn't as quick as a regular camera.  Right. You're not going to get like, nothing like that.  Yes, it's very slow.  Very slow.  So I took one shot.  So I figure if it's a slow camera, you would wait until you have visual boobage and then snap it. 
[35:00]
 Okay, go.  So I took the shot, and when we downloaded it to look at the picture, she was only halfway up.  Ah, ah.  So why didn't you wait until you saw the brights shining in your...  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  You were anticipating, weren't you?  Like a regular camera. I was just bad timing.  Oh, yeah.  Earl, you let us all down.  He lost the shot.  I lost the shot.  That prize shot. 
[35:30]
 That was the only shot we cared about.  Who cares about the stupid Bronco?  We got 50 shots of the smashed Bronco, the one picture of the girl that exposed herself to the crowd.  With the huge globes.  That's Karen, right? Karen's online?  Maybe she'll recreate the scene for us.  Karen.  Yes?  We don't have a picture of your lovely boobs on our website.  I'm sorry.  Hmm.  Earl wasn't fast enough with the camera.  See, and I did it for a good amount of time, too.  Yeah, you did. And you started jumping up and down. 
[36:00]
 Oh, yeah.  They were moving.  Earl, you could have got 20 shots.  I know.  20. We just needed one picture of it.  I was a little busy.  Digital camera doesn't go fast.  It's like he's using a Kodak Brownie, like one of those old original cameras.  What, do you have like the flash powder on the stick?  Wait a minute.  Come on, Earl.  How long did it take to reload?  My batteries were going out.  Oh, batteries.  Earl, underneath the big cloth.  You know how you have to pull the 19th century photographer. 
[36:30]
 You got to pull the rag over your head.  Smile, push the plunger.  I like playing 19th century photographer when I go out on weekends.  Go behind a girl and pull the dress up.  Smile!  Take a bow!  The film's got to be changed.  Well, Karen, we don't have a picture of you,  but we have 20 other pictures from our event this past Friday.  Yeah, I know. I look.  What the heck is wrong with the phone today?  Oh, my God.  All right. Yeah, well, maybe one of the next things we do, 
[37:00]
 you could come down and we could get a recreation or something.  I would so be there.  Or maybe you could come down to the studio tomorrow.  We'll take a few shots.  Or that.  I can do that.  And we can have them on our website by 4 o'clock tomorrow.  I can so do that.  Because so many people want to see what your boobs look like.  I'm sure.  And there's a big argument going on.  A lot of people thought that only one of your nipples were pierced.  No.  Both.  Oh, see?  Most people only saw the one.  Both. 
[37:30]
 And was there a tat?  Yes, there was.  Okay.  A butterfly tattoo.  We have to do this all from memory, unfortunately.  From memory.  It was a little busy.  I think the best was the hair.  You had no problem taking pictures of all the guys.  No, stop it.  Yeah, the group shot.  The group shot.  That's a nice picture, you know.  Yeah.  But, you know, we don't have your boobs.  I'm highly insulted.  All right.  We'll talk to Rick.  We'll try to set some up for maybe tomorrow.  Okay.  All right.  Cool. 
[38:00]
 Because our preferred listeners would love to see you.  And so would you guys, I'm sure.  Oh, no.  We're professionals.  This is just for our listeners.  Yeah, we're doing it for our listeners.  Yeah.  That's about it, all right?  Like you didn't enjoy it.  Anyway, okay.  So what are the odds of you doing this for the Today Show thing?  Oh, they're so good.  I can tell you that.  They're so good.  Really?  It's a matter of picking a day.  All right.  Well, that money's still on the line.  First Girl shows her boobs during the Today Show.  And it has to say Opie and Anthony, right?  Yeah, or we'll accept any W.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony would be nice, though.  All right.  Or Opie.  And you guys?  All right.  Hold on for Rick.  Okay. 
[38:30]
 All right.  There she goes, Karen.  Off and running.  Yes.  All right.  Clinton's State of the Union address tonight.  Care.  Why is it on 50 channels?  I don't know.  If they list all the channels, his address is going to be on.  Couldn't we just pick two?  Maybe CNN and Channel 2?  No, because they all have to show it so that they have to show it.  Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.

[39:30]
 Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.  So you're going to be on the same channel as them?  Yeah.  I'm playing for, I don't know, 20 straight hours now.  See?  I take a break to come in here to do the radio show.  You found one that you got addicted to.  Yes.  Now how long is the longest you have spent online or on the PlayStation playing Tomb Raider?  Eight hours.  Eight hours.  Eight hours.  And you were laughing at me for ten.  Eight hours before the jet game.  And then another four after the jet game.  Remember him laughing at me for spending ten hours playing Half-Life? 
[40:00]
 Yeah.  And you're like, oh my God, that's crazy.  Eight is fine.  Now you're crazy.  Hey man, I had to figure out what to do with Lara.  I've got to get Lara through the jungle.  There's tigers coming at me and stupid monkeys that are grabbing my med packs and stuff.  Now I found the shotgun.  I'm blowing away the monkeys.  They tell you not to blow away the stupid monkeys, but I'm blowing them away.  And shoot the monkeys.  They tell you where to go.  Well, yeah.  But it's fun when you see them explode though. 
[40:30]
 Isn't it though?  Yes.  I found the river and then I had to jump in and now I'm underwater in these tunnels and  I popped out in this ancient temple that's filled with water, with waterfalls and I don't  know what to do now.  This is only the first quarter of the game.  So you're hooked.  I am hooked.  I think I've settled down a little.  I've calmed down with my computer game.  I think, oh yeah, yeah, Half-Life.  I'm only on there for twelve hours a day now. 
[41:00]
 As a matter of fact, Optima Cable went to my house earlier today.  Cable Modem for my multiplayer habit.  I'll beat you people that I play with online.  I'll be kicking your ass tonight.  And I got Metal Gear on the side waiting to play.  That's the next one when I get done with Tomb Raider 3.  Metal Gear is good, man.  Yeah, with Snake.  Snake Rocks.  Also, New Duke Nukem coming out soon.  Yeah, I've got to play that one as well. 
[41:30]
 So they're just piling up in my house.  Oh yeah, there's plenty of death and destruction for everybody.  It's fun.  You know, speaking of PlayStation, I tried, I don't know, John Madden's NFL 99 or whatever.  And I don't know how you figure out how to play a football game with the PlayStation.  Yeah!  1027W, I.D.W. with Opie and Anthony.  That's becoming the theme song for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, I believe.  It's very appropriate.  I like the other one as well. 
[42:00]
 Which one?  From the Hummer Queen that was sent in to us.  That's a good one.  It's a quickie.  Sure, sure.  Let's listen to it real fast.  It's Hummer Time, Hummer Time, Hummer Home, Hummer Time, Hummer Time.  Opie and Anthony have a club on Tuesday.  Open wide it's time to play our Hummer Time.  Ask your wife politely to get down on her knees 
[42:30]
 Don't forget to say please because it's Hummer Time  Tuesday is a boring day so take this tip from O&A  Have a ball, take to the stall, it's an RL3 for us  It's spit or swallow, it's okay, watch those teeth  It's cause you're saying hey don't worry  That's a basic Hummer Time 
[43:00]
 Man, who would have figured on this one?  Well they were saying he was pretty much dead 
[43:30]
 That's it, they were using words like very dire situation  Would you like some peanuts?  Last rites were given, oh no thank you  Okay, you're an idiot  I'm just trying to get my workbook out here  I noticed I had some peanuts  The family signed a do not resuscitate order, remember that?  It was really bad and then the next day would come by and  Jolton Joe is making a comeback  He's looking good  He was caught in a run down between life and death 
[44:00]
 He was running back towards life  And then the next day, oh my God he's going back towards death  So then finally he said hey, knock it off  Wait till this pans out and then just shut up  No more reports on my health, leave me alone  And then a month goes by and it hits the news yesterday that he's out of the hospital  He was released, 84 years old  And not only that, George Steinbrenner  Corky Steinbrenner has come out and said  That he will probably throw out the first pitch 
[44:30]
 Next season, yogi  Remember he had made up with yogi barah  Because everyone thought that Jody was going to drop dead  So then yogi would throw out the pitch  Yogi would be the surviving, the yanking, the whole time  So now it looks like yogi is going to catch Jody's pitch  bitch. Is that what they're saying though? Yeah. Come on. I'm not kidding. You read that  somewhere? Yeah, it's right here in New York. God, I want to see that. I know. Come on. 
[45:00]
 He can't crouch down in that position anymore. Yogi, not crouching, but you think Joe? He's  got to stand two feet away from him. I mean we all love Joe D. The jolting Joe? Yes. But  I mean 84 years old he was saying hi to St. Peter a couple of weeks ago. I don't know  if he's going to be winging that ball. You know? Maybe we could give him a wiffle ball. 
[45:30]
 That might work too. But of course Corky Steinbrenner, once again very emotional. Now is this an  actual quote that we can find in the paper, Anthony? Of course. Where is it? It's page  four of Newsday. It's got George Steinbrenner. It's all bold letters. And he's saying about  the recovery that Joe D. made, this is one of the greatest moments in Yankee history. 
[46:00]
 Might remember his previous quotes. This is the best team in baseball. Getting this trophy  from you makes it even worse. From a man I've known for 20 some odd years. So what is his  latest quote again? I've got to hear that again. This is one of the greatest moments 
[46:30]
 in Yankee history, boy. So Corky is very happy that Joe D will probably be thrown out the  first pitch. I think we're all happy. Oh no, here he comes. Corky Steinbrenner. Very happy.  Joe D. to add a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad

[56:30]
 I'm going to rock my socks off and yours too  Regis is asking about you  when you gonna get him on the show  we were supposed to have him on about a month ago  he's a mad man  is his shoulder okay from Brian Leach's shot the other morning I saw that  yeah I haven't asked him but it looked like it hurt  Brian Leach was taking shots at Regis  full goalie attire  but no one knew that and Brian Leach takes the final shot 
[57:00]
 Regis in the shoulder and all of a sudden Regis drops his glove  and his stick and lifts his mask up and goes  I don't have any pads  and you can hear the hush over the crowd they were freaking out  you hear the funk we hit him too  Regis is a tough guy  I'm telling you he's a very tough guy  but Brian used maybe like 30% of his power and still nailed Regis right in the blade  could have went right through his arm if he 100%  he was in black and blue 
[57:30]
 tell Regis we said hi  about the one where Stone Cold Steve Austin from WWF wrestling was on  he loves Stone Cold Steve Austin  and they got in like a little goof play wrestling thing  because Stone Cold can like snap him in half  he spun around and hit him in the nose with his arm accidentally  and Regis grabbed his nose like ahhh  and Stone Cold is like hey what's the matter I get you in the snout  I thought that was great in the snout  opened up a can of whoop ass on you Regis Philbin 
[58:00]
 and that's the bottom line  because Stone Cold said so  we want to stay can we do another hour  yeah well you know how Gary enjoys when we stay late  does Gary like that?  I'm not sure some days he likes it and other days he wishes we would  I don't know if he likes it at all  well tomorrow thanks Tony we'll see you next on the radio 
[58:30]
 tomorrow we got Stephen Lynch our buddy  our pal who comes up with all the goof songs that you've come to know and love  yes can't wait he's got a couple songs tomorrow  he's got a song about hemaphrodites  that's a great little subject for a diddy  and he's got a song about kittens  killer kitten or something like that  that's a cute little song about a priest right?  sure it's touching  I can't wait I think he could be our favorite guest 
[59:00]
 he is he's right up there  between him Mark Golan from Maxim and Lewis Black from  Carmi Central as a matter of fact that's the only guest we have on our show  yeah that's true  we say no to everyone else because if you don't get the vibe in here  we don't want you in here  Tony is on the list too  yeah you made our list Tony  you're good energy there  Lewis is a great guy 
[59:30]
 he's coming in soon I think next Thursday or something like that  Andrea wants to know if she was on the list  she's quiet when she comes in here  you know something we've got to draw the line no  what she gives us the cool music to play  it's going to turn into everybody it's just like the bomb shelter episode of  happy days  how big is the list?  before you know it Fonzie is coming with his motorcycle  well yeah there's three people on the list that are 
[60:00]
 allowed to come in during the show Tony  it's Black Earl, Ben the Fag and the Hummer Queen  those are the only three  it took me a long time to figure that one out  so those are the three people that are allowed to walk in while we're doing our thing  they don't wreck the energy or the chemistry or the feel of the room  there are other people they come in here and they suck the air right out of here  people can inadvertently ruin the energy just by having to conduct business  while we're on the air  that's the Andrea thing 
[60:30]
 if she wants to come in just to hang out that's one thing but if it's business oriented  energy down the toilet  I say Andrea is allowed to come in Anthony  as long as she's not conducting business  she wants to come and hang she's a good hang  it's nothing personal it's strictly business  but we have a list outside the door now we lock the door at 3 o'clock  and we have a velvet rope and Black Earl stays out there  and he checks the list to see if you're allowed to come in or not  and that's how it's going to be for now on </pre>
